1
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:02,811
I work in Human Resources or "HR,"
as some people call it.

2
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:05,314
And I have this poster
in my office that says,

3
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:07,939
"Keep calm and go to your safe place."

4
00:01:08,527 --> 00:01:12,154
Well, when I get a little stressed out
or my anxiety spikes,

5
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,948
I close my eyes and picture my cul-de-sac,

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:19,119
and my wonderful wife, Karen,
and our two sons, Patrick and Mikey.

7
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:23,004
Because that's the place where I know
everything is always okay.

8
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:25,463
No matter what.

9
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:35,177
- Bye, Mikey, Patrick. Bye, you guys.
- Bye, guys.

10
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,012
You can text us
the minute you get to camp.

11
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,180
Yeah, okay.

12
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,057
And if you get any ticks,
put it in the plastic baggie

13
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,268
with the date and time of the bite,
and I'll get them tested.

14
00:01:43,353 --> 00:01:45,813
Change your socks. Okay, guys?
Change your socks.

15
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,314
We love you. We love you.
We're gonna miss you.

16
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:48,941
- Love you guys!
- Have so much fun!

17
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,026
Be strong!

18
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,069
Be strong.

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,077
Did that bus driver
look sober to you, honey?

20
00:02:00,162 --> 00:02:02,788
Because he gave me a really weird look
when I smelled his breath.

21
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,713
Well, I think you just startled him.

22
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,625
Look, there's Meg.

23
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,750
Hey, Meg.

24
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:09,754
I sold it.

25
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,714
- That was so fast.
- Thank you.

26
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,049
All cash buyers.

27
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,551
All cash buyers? That's fancy.

28
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,429
Yeah. And the best part is,
they didn't even see it.

29
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:20,139
They just saw the pictures online.

30
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:22,474
I haven't even met them
in person. It's crazy.

31
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:25,269
Who buys a house without seeing it first?

32
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:27,604
I know. Maybe it's a celebrity, you know?

33
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,149
Come on, Jeff.
No celebrity is gonna move here.

34
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,864
I hope it's not some kind of
meth lab situation.

35
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:35,070
There he is.

36
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,235
- Sorry.
- Where have you been?

37
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:39,992
Kinko's was bananas.

38
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,327
It often is.

39
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,705
So exciting. New neighbors, right?

40
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,249
And, Karen, I left your card in the foyer,

41
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:49,544
- just in case they want a decorator.
- Thank you.

42
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:51,795
So did you tell

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,630
Jeff about my new idea
for the guest bathroom?

44
00:02:55,926 --> 00:02:57,426
No.

45
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,178
Artist's loft.

46
00:02:59,263 --> 00:03:01,054
Think Brooklyn, okay?

47
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,979
Exposed brick, visible plumbing. And...

48
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:05,476
A urinal.

49
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:07,019
A urinal!

50
00:03:07,104 --> 00:03:10,114
That's really for me.
Meg wants me standing up again.

51
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:15,398
Well, I suppose I'd better get started
on the urinal.

52
00:03:16,238 --> 00:03:20,657
Yeah, no. I know
what you're getting started on.

53
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,832
Empty house, kids are gone.

54
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:25,454
Please.

55
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:28,332
- Honeymoon.
- All right, keep it PG, guys.

56
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:31,251
Well, we gotta go
flyer the subdivision anyway.

57
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:34,086
- We're gonna pound the pavement.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,091
- Jeff, you should try it hyena style.
- We'll try it.

59
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,395
That's the noise I make.

60
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,723
I think Meg has changed up
her medication, honey.

61
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,478
What's Dan's excuse then?

62
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,811
Some of that stuff
they were saying was demented.

63
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,356
- Disgusting.
- Yeah.

64
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,437
But maybe they have a point. I don't know.

65
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,911
Alone in the house.

66
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,744
First time in a long time.

67
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,331
Yeah, I mean, we can do whatever we want.

68
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:52,666
I DVR-ed the Good Wife.

69
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,251
Great. I'll make popcorn.

70
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:01,341
- Back it up.
- You got it.

71
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:03,510
- How much room we got?
- Almost there.

72
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,845
Hey, Bernie.

73
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,020
New neighbors aren't wasting
any time moving in, are they?

74
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:08,484
Nope.

75
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,518
You're gonna clean that up, right, Berno?

76
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:12,644
Always do.

77
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,559
Okay, have a good one.

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,358
Come on, guys. Let's get outta here.

79
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,993
Come on, fellas. Let's go. Come on.

80
00:05:29,204 --> 00:05:30,454
Hi, Jack. Good morning.

81
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,789
Don't let anybody say that to you
on a plane. "Hijack."

82
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:34,291
Good morning, anyway.

83
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,376
Morning.

84
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:38,554
Hi, Diane.

85
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,013
Jeff, good morning.

86
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:44,635
See those moving vans?

87
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,470
Couldn't miss them.

88
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,763
- Gosh!
- So,

89
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:49,890
- any word on the new neighbors?
- No.

90
00:05:49,975 --> 00:05:51,100
- Anything?
- Nothing.

91
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:52,810
Guarantee they're no Dave and Bridget.

92
00:05:52,895 --> 00:05:54,937
Well, at least the summer's
not a total loss.

93
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:56,980
I mean, we got Junetoberfest
to look forward to.

94
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,565
- Yes, we do.
- And our jobs.

95
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,900
Always have our jobs.

96
00:05:59,985 --> 00:06:01,495
By the way, how's it going upstairs?

97
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,656
Jesus, Jeff. You know I can't
talk about what we do upstairs.

98
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,201
Yeah. I know. It's all right.

99
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:12,037
Hey, by the way, I still have those indoor
skydiving lessons if you wanna join me.

100
00:06:12,122 --> 00:06:13,372
My treat.

101
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,792
This week's really hectic.
Kid stuff. But, maybe.

102
00:06:16,877 --> 00:06:18,460
Just text me. Or I'll text you.

103
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,629
Okay, we'll talk about it later.
Have a good one.

104
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,844
- All right.
- Hey, Sheila. Good morning.

105
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Morning, Louise.

106
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,593
Morning, Sharon.

107
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,512
Hi, Jeff. Dr. Fisher called.

108
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:29,638
Yeah? What did he say?

109
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:33,475
He said, "Please tell Jeff to stop
texting me about indoor skydiving."

110
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,650
He's joking. He's a riot. Hey, Doug.

111
00:06:46,281 --> 00:06:47,281
Hey, Sanjay.

112
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,033
Hey, Jeff. Can I use your computer?

113
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,827
I need to reorder my anti-depressants.

114
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,121
Of course. Mi computer, su computer.

115
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,206
Where are you? Who's that?

116
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,631
This is Jeff.

117
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:02,134
Jeff lets me use his computer because
security prohibits Internet upstairs.

118
00:07:02,631 --> 00:07:05,674
And why does Jeff have Internet?

119
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,389
Because Jeff does unimportant work.

120
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,888
Human Resources.

121
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,515
Are we getting written up?
'Cause I emailed him last night

122
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,351
and apologized.
He said he was fine. And we have

123
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,645
- put this behind us.
- It's all fine.

124
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,316
I wouldn't be doing my job if we
didn't go over a couple of exercises.

125
00:07:22,401 --> 00:07:24,691
So, grab a stress ball.

126
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:26,528
Really?

127
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:28,743
Okay, so, Margaret's gonna show us...

128
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:31,411
the meaning of trust.

129
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,328
- Hey, Sanjay?
- Yeah?

130
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,423
Did I tell you that I ate at
a Indian restaurant the other night?

131
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,957
Yeah, I had to call
and make an Indian reservation.

132
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,515
Yang, tell Oren how he makes you feel.

133
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:50,803
Maybe you should just write us up.
That might be easier.

134
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:54,018
I once knew an Indian who drank
so much tea, he died in his "tea-pee."

135
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,517
That was a good one.

136
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,232
Okay, Margaret. Go ahead.

137
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,740
Wow.

138
00:08:50,489 --> 00:08:52,739
Yes, I do feel like you are jealous.

139
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:57,453
I can sense the resentment every time
I bring up gravitational perturbations.

140
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:59,413
Is that bad? That sounds bad.
What is that? Is that like...

141
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,288
Gravitational perturbations?
That's a laugh!

142
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:03,917
Plus, what about my work?

143
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:06,253
I mentioned velocity vectors one time...

144
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,796
New neighbors!

145
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,091
One time, and you try to get me
bumped down to Dhameer's team?

146
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,216
You were supposed to calculate...

147
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,808
This is all because
I hooked up with Sharada.

148
00:09:19,893 --> 00:09:21,935
You what?
You hooked up with Sharada Ganjali?

149
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,650
I'll kill you!

150
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:29,401
Oren, this is no way
to settle a workplace dispute!

151
00:09:29,486 --> 00:09:30,896
Sharon, call security!

152
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,164
Hiya, Jeff!

153
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:43,378
- Karen.
- Hey, honey!

154
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,748
Hey, darling.

155
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,378
Still spying on the neighbors?

156
00:09:49,423 --> 00:09:50,763
Hi, there.

157
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:53,176
Hello.

158
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:55,927
You must be Jeff.

159
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,971
I'm Tim. This is my wife, Natalie.

160
00:09:58,056 --> 00:10:01,100
We're the Joneses! Nice to meet you, Jeff.

161
00:10:01,185 --> 00:10:03,393
Nice to meet you guys.
That was a joke about spying...

162
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,896
It's a joke. I'd never spy on anyone.

163
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:07,361
We love humor.

164
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:09,400
Humor...

165
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,488
So, Natalie was just telling me that
she's a social media consultant.

166
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:16,448
Yeah. I also write a cooking blog.

167
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,908
I love blogs.

168
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:20,793
Yeah, and I work with a charity
for Sri Lankan orphans.

169
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,580
Those are my biggest passions.

170
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,832
Natalie's got a big heart.

171
00:10:24,917 --> 00:10:26,497
Aw, thank you, baby.

172
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:29,630
Yeah...

173
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,839
- Why don't you tell them about...
- What?

174
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:34,434
She has passions too. Why don't you
tell them about the urinal?

175
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,093
No, honey!

176
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,138
- It's nothing.
- No, please. It sounds interesting.

177
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:42,433
I'm picking up a slight accent.
Is that Pittsburgh, maybe?

178
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,768
- She's from Greece.
- Oh, God.

179
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:46,186
No, but we've lived all over.

180
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:49,651
And now, it's finally time
to plant some roots. Right?

181
00:10:51,068 --> 00:10:54,820
I can't tell you how excited we are
to be here on Maple Circle.

182
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:56,071
Such a lovely street.

183
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,239
It really is.

184
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,699
- Thank you.
- We love it.

185
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,452
It's fascinating. In other cultures,
they don't have anything like this.

186
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:02,703
No, they don't.

187
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,037
In Chinese, for example.

188
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:05,622
They don't even have a word
for a street like this.

189
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:06,790
What? For cul-de-sac?

190
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,955
No. No. I mean, they would say...

191
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,379
Which is, loosely,

192
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,381
- "happy place of heart and mind."
- Right.

193
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,092
But it doesn't really capture
the essence of it, right?

194
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,007
But it's cool coming out of your mouth.

195
00:11:20,055 --> 00:11:22,055
- Tim's a travel writer.
- Really?

196
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,974
- Wow! We love to travel.
- We do.

197
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:27,436
Yeah. We went to Epcot Center
last summer, was it? Yeah.

198
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,522
You can go to every country,
like, within three blocks.

199
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:32,357
Perfect. That's what we like about it.

200
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,567
We went with the boys over there.

201
00:11:33,652 --> 00:11:37,069
That's Patrick and Mikey. Patrick's leaning
against the wheel. He's just a real cuddler.

202
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:39,243
- They're beautiful.
- Adorable.

203
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,200
Mikey made this.

204
00:11:41,285 --> 00:11:42,826
- Wow!
- What a talent!

205
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,829
- Speaking of which, we brought you...
- Yes, yes.

206
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:46,924
...a little something.

207
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:48,665
What?

208
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,710
- That's amazing! Really?
- Give me a break!

209
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,795
I made it myself.

210
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,340
You made it yourself?

211
00:11:57,426 --> 00:11:58,926
Wow. Look at this.

212
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,135
- What is this?
- What is that?

213
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
A sculpture.

214
00:12:01,305 --> 00:12:02,679
Tim blows his own glass.

215
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,556
Look at it in the light, honey.
It sort of...

216
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,433
- That's gorgeous. Look at that.
- Gorgeous.

217
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:09,228
- You made that?
- Yeah, it's a hobby I picked up in Hungary.

218
00:12:09,313 --> 00:12:13,653
I wrote an article about this
Hungarian glass-blowing master, Yorgi.

219
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:16,566
- Thank you. I don't know what to say.
- You don't need to say anything.

220
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,947
Just put it right there
and use it as a conversation piece.

221
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:21,949
- That's cool. Thank you very much!
- Thank you.

222
00:12:22,034 --> 00:12:23,951
- Anyway, we should get going.
- Yeah.

223
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:25,826
- Yeah. We should.
- Okay.

224
00:12:26,747 --> 00:12:28,122
I feel like I should give you guys a gift.

225
00:12:28,207 --> 00:12:29,456
I didn't know we were giving gifts.

226
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,166
- That's not necessary.
- You want a stress ball?

227
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,584
No, you don't want a stress ball.
That would be stupid.

228
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,669
I'd love a stress ball.

229
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,212
- Thank you.
- Yes! They really work.

230
00:12:35,297 --> 00:12:36,296
Thank you.

231
00:12:36,381 --> 00:12:38,340
- Let me just get this out of your way.
- No, Jeff will get that.

232
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,675
- No, no, no.
- That's nice.

233
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,470
It's all good. We're neighbors now.

234
00:12:41,929 --> 00:12:43,053
All right.

235
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:47,098
Have you guys ever been to
or heard of Junetoberfest?

236
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:49,935
- Junetoberfest?
- Yeah.

237
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,437
You guys should really come.

238
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:53,522
It's our annual summer get-together.

239
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,399
The whole neighborhood comes.
A really fun group.

240
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,692
A lot of us work together.

241
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:57,860
At MBI?

242
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:01,655
Yeah. We have a dart tournament.
We have bratwurst.

243
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,615
I make my own home brew,
which is my passion.

244
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:04,700
Good!

245
00:13:04,785 --> 00:13:06,295
How'd you know that Jeff works at MBI?

246
00:13:07,371 --> 00:13:09,455
Jeff must've mentioned it. Right, Jeff?

247
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,457
- No. No, he didn't.
- That's okay, honey...

248
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,582
No, Jeff didn't mention it.

249
00:13:14,753 --> 00:13:16,795
- The stress ball.
- Must've been a lucky guess, I guess.

250
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,381
- No, it's right there.
- Lucky guess. Yeah, we should go.

251
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:22,009
It's getting late.
Thank you so much for everything.

252
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:23,844
The coffee was delicious.

253
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,099
- Thank you.
- And we'll see you at Junetoberfest!

254
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:32,770
So, let me show you a picture.
This is Tyler.

255
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,855
And Tyler's gonna go
to asthma camp this summer.

256
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,070
Oh, my God! He's so handsome!

257
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,317
- Hiya, neighbor.
- Hey.

258
00:13:45,534 --> 00:13:49,703
"Seared yellowtail with lemon zest and
ginger shavings." Who the hell made this?

259
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:52,247
Natalie. Apparently,
she can do everything.

260
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm sorry, but who wears that
to a barbecue?

261
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,293
I mean, there are kids here.

262
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:58,298
Come on, Meg. It's just a summer dress.

263
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:03,926
It's a very short, very chic,
extremely flattering summer dress.

264
00:14:04,011 --> 00:14:05,681
Yeah, well, it's pornographic.

265
00:14:07,014 --> 00:14:09,314
Look at Dan pretending to check his email.

266
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:14,517
If I find pictures of her ass
on his phone, BJ night is canceled.

267
00:14:15,439 --> 00:14:19,358
So, anyway, there I am, alone, in the
middle of the Empty Quarter, all by myself,

268
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:25,072
with no water, dying of thirst. I'm literally
writing a goodbye letter to Natalie.

269
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:27,157
And what do I see
coming up over the horizon?

270
00:14:27,242 --> 00:14:29,701
But the exact same camel...

271
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,912
whose life I saved three years earlier.

272
00:14:31,997 --> 00:14:33,789
- Exact same one.
- Did he remember you?

273
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:36,504
No. No, Jeff.
He didn't remember me. He's a camel.

274
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,670
But I was able to ride him
into civilization.

275
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:42,464
And I filed my story, with 15 minutes
to spare, thank you very much.

276
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,632
Caught the next flight to Marrakesh

277
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:46,718
and was sitting in a café with Natalie
smoking hookah later that night.

278
00:14:46,803 --> 00:14:49,393
- No way!
- I wanna smoke a hookah in Marrakesh.

279
00:14:50,015 --> 00:14:52,141
Well, Stacey,
I know it sounds very romantic.

280
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,976
But, trust me, the world can be
a very dark and disturbing place.

281
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,479
Tim, you want a beer?

282
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:58,904
Sure. Yeah. Thank you.

283
00:14:59,525 --> 00:15:01,115
- Here you go.
- There it is.

284
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:10,617
Wow, good job... Buddy, buddy.
Yeah, buddy. Wow!

285
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,286
- That is a lot of blood.
- It's fine. It's okay.

286
00:15:12,371 --> 00:15:13,495
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

287
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,621
It's just gushing a bit.

288
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,789
- Just hold on to that.
- Yes.

289
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,915
Give me this.

290
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,167
- It's sprung a leak.
- Just...

291
00:15:18,252 --> 00:15:20,294
- I feel a little bit light-headed.
- Close your hand around it.

292
00:15:20,379 --> 00:15:21,759
- If I could just maybe...
- No!

293
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,382
You can't rattle me.

294
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,804
Witness... Witness my destiny.

295
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:31,564
Neighborhood champ, five years in a row!

296
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,892
Hey! You wanna give it a try?

297
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,017
- Me?
- Yeah!

298
00:15:36,895 --> 00:15:37,936
No,

299
00:15:38,021 --> 00:15:39,480
- I'll only embarrass myself.
- "No" is not an answer.

300
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:40,606
Come on. It's so easy.

301
00:15:40,691 --> 00:15:41,899
- It's a bad idea.
- Look,

302
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:45,194
I'll even show you
the famous Craverston grip, okay?

303
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,779
- All right.
- Put that in your hand.

304
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,614
Now hold it like a pencil.

305
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,282
Now cock your wrist.

306
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:51,950
- Right.
- Good, good. Elbow out.

307
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:53,535
And then you just kinda throw at it.

308
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,700
Like this?

309
00:15:55,873 --> 00:15:57,206
This is good?

310
00:15:57,291 --> 00:15:59,833
Well, you kinda throw like a girl.

311
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:02,798
But when a girl is as beautiful as you
she doesn't have to be good.

312
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:08,432
Do you mind if I skip the Craverston grip?

313
00:16:09,178 --> 00:16:10,178
Okay, good luck.

314
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:26,949
Oh, my God! Look at that!

315
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,158
Maybe I should show you
how to throw like a girl.

316
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,124
Suck on that, Craverston.

317
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:41,539
Shut up, Oren.

318
00:16:42,252 --> 00:16:43,292
Where's your girlfriend?

319
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,353
Tim.

320
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:03,938
Hey, Karen.
I was just looking for the bathroom.

321
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,316
You were in Jeff's den.

322
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,111
Yeah. I must've made a wrong turn.

323
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,614
Lovely place you have here,
by the way. You have a great eye.

324
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,699
Thank you.

325
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,159
Was that your design work
I saw downstairs?

326
00:17:15,244 --> 00:17:17,953
Jeff had mentioned something
about urinals.

327
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:20,456
Yes. Well, the customer's always right.

328
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,541
But, yeah, they are my drawings.

329
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:24,626
Customer's always right.
Except when they're not.

330
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,298
- The bathroom's that way, Tim.
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

331
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:48,189
That was one of the best Junetoberfests
we have ever, ever had.

332
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:51,403
Have you ever seen a couple
move into a neighborhood

333
00:17:51,488 --> 00:17:52,948
so nicely as the Joneses?

334
00:17:53,907 --> 00:17:56,283
You don't you think there's
something off about them?

335
00:17:56,368 --> 00:18:01,916
I mean, they're so overly accomplished, and
stylish and affectionate with one another.

336
00:18:03,292 --> 00:18:04,374
Why would they wanna live here?

337
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:06,499
Karen, they told you,
they wanna settle down.

338
00:18:07,546 --> 00:18:08,796
You know that he was in your den today?

339
00:18:09,173 --> 00:18:10,172
Yeah, so?

340
00:18:10,257 --> 00:18:13,592
So, he can navigate
the bazaars of Marrakesh,

341
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:16,970
but he gets "lost upstairs"
looking for a bathroom?

342
00:18:17,055 --> 00:18:18,764
Karen, let me tell you something
I learned years ago.

343
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:22,267
When people have to poop,
they get embarrassed.

344
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,352
As do I, sometimes.

345
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:26,647
Really? You think he had to poop?

346
00:18:26,732 --> 00:18:28,022
Probably, yes.

347
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,985
You know, if the Joneses seem a little
bit more affectionate than we do,

348
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,072
it's because they haven't had to mute
their passions the way we have

349
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,698
'cause the kids have been around.

350
00:18:36,783 --> 00:18:40,244
But now, it's our time.
It's our summer. Watch my hand there.

351
00:18:40,329 --> 00:18:44,039
And I think it's time
to get busy sexually.

352
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:46,917
No. It tickles, honey. Honey!

353
00:18:47,002 --> 00:18:48,252
- Honey, I know we said every second...
- Come on!

354
00:18:48,337 --> 00:18:49,545
Look at the time. Look how late it is.

355
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,297
It's traditional Gaffney foreplay.
Let me just do it.

356
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:53,512
Come on, baby. Come on.

357
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:56,427
I'm so tired. But I pick up on things.

358
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:58,345
I was the one who noticed
when the McNultys

359
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,430
were pirating the Yamamotos' cable.

360
00:19:01,725 --> 00:19:05,395
Yes, and intuition is a wonderful thing.

361
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,482
And take it from me,
somebody who has had 16 years

362
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,817
of human resource experience,

363
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:16,662
that the Joneses are perfectly nice,
normal, everyday people.

364
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:27,287
I didn't know what to do.

365
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:31,879
Smoke blows from the car, you know?
So I figured

366
00:19:31,964 --> 00:19:36,759
Americans are really good with car...
You strong man!

367
00:19:36,844 --> 00:19:38,010
So you can help me out?

368
00:19:38,095 --> 00:19:41,180
Absolutely. You came to the right guys.

369
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:43,275
We Americans are good at a lot of things.

370
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:27,577
Jeff.

371
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,209
Jeff, wake up.

372
00:22:08,829 --> 00:22:11,209
Who are you, Tim Jones?

373
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:34,770
Sorry.

374
00:22:35,689 --> 00:22:36,980
Neighbor!

375
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,899
- Hey, Jeff. This...
- Oh, my goodness.

376
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:40,359
This is embarrassing.

377
00:22:40,444 --> 00:22:42,824
Well, it happens.
Jeepers, let me help you.

378
00:22:43,363 --> 00:22:44,404
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

379
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,948
What are you doing here?

380
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:49,368
I found your love
of home brewing contagious.

381
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:51,293
And I figured I could use a hobby.

382
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,210
Instead of glass blowing?

383
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,457
Right. Besides that. Besides that.

384
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,922
It's a cool hobby, but it's probably
not as manly as you'd like.

385
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,673
Hey, Ed. Set my friend up here.

386
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:05,175
He's gonna need some wort chillers,
probably need some fizz drops.

387
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,427
- Give him some yeast.
- You're the expert.

388
00:23:06,512 --> 00:23:08,178
- Yup.
- Don't let that yeast get infected.

389
00:23:08,263 --> 00:23:09,263
- Okay.
- I'm kidding.

390
00:23:09,348 --> 00:23:11,014
It's a joke. It's a yeast infection joke.

391
00:23:11,099 --> 00:23:14,229
- Expensive hobby.
- It's more of a calling, Tim.

392
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,230
- Hey, are you hungry?
- I'm famished.

393
00:23:18,315 --> 00:23:20,615
- You like Chinese?
- The food?

394
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:22,820
Yeah.

395
00:23:31,912 --> 00:23:33,252
Come on!

396
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:49,014
Spy force on.

397
00:24:14,413 --> 00:24:17,331
I am leaving this message
in case anything happens to me.

398
00:24:17,416 --> 00:24:20,834
I'm following Natalie Jones
who I have good reason to believe...

399
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,839
- Calling Natalie Jones.
- No!

400
00:24:23,422 --> 00:24:26,262
No! No, no, no!

401
00:24:27,467 --> 00:24:28,797
Siri!

402
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:36,806
Thank you.

403
00:24:38,312 --> 00:24:39,772
Have a nice day.

404
00:24:49,156 --> 00:24:50,406
How's the book?

405
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,698
Interesting.

406
00:25:21,146 --> 00:25:23,313
Hi, there! Nice to see you. Yes, indeed.

407
00:25:23,398 --> 00:25:27,025
That's is my friend, Jeff.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Lu. Okay.

408
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:28,530
All right, we're gonna go on back.

409
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,780
I know! I feel like I've been
putting on a little too much.

410
00:25:31,865 --> 00:25:35,035
Thank you. Come on
back here, Jeff. Thank you.

411
00:25:37,079 --> 00:25:39,913
I'm doing a little piece on,
sort of, hidden gems around the city.

412
00:25:39,998 --> 00:25:41,415
- Now, that place is good...
- Yeah?

413
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:44,918
...but this place is great.
Come on, follow me.

414
00:25:45,003 --> 00:25:46,795
It's good to get out of the
cul-de-sac every now and again.

415
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,880
Well, it is, yeah.

416
00:25:47,965 --> 00:25:49,173
- I love my cul-de-sac.
- There he is.

417
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:50,591
I knew I felt your presence, man!

418
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:52,050
- What's up, brother?
- How are you, pal?

419
00:25:52,135 --> 00:25:53,135
This is my friend, Jeff.

420
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,219
Jeff, this is Ricky. He owns the place.

421
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:55,596
- Hi, Ricky, how are you?
- What's up, Jeff?

422
00:25:55,681 --> 00:25:57,351
You don't have to bow down. Don't be shy.

423
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:59,523
Come on in, man. This guy's stiff!

424
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:02,978
Welcome to the Cobra Club.

425
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:08,901
Well, now,
this is Jeff's first time. So...

426
00:26:08,986 --> 00:26:11,653
Don't worry.
We'll take good care of him, man.

427
00:26:11,738 --> 00:26:12,780
Where do you want us?

428
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:15,240
- Right there, man.
- Thank you. I'll take a shéjiû.

429
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,533
- One?
- Yup.

430
00:26:16,618 --> 00:26:17,618
- Yeah. Two.
- Two?

431
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:20,003
- Whatever he's having.
- Two shéjiûs coming up.

432
00:26:21,248 --> 00:26:23,499
So? A little different
than you were expecting?

433
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:26,251
I gotta tell you. Spice and I
don't sit very well together.

434
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:30,216
There's certain ramifications the next
day, you know, toilet-wise, but...

435
00:26:31,008 --> 00:26:32,007
This is not that.

436
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,760
Okay? It's not spicy,
but this is the real stuff.

437
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,011
I'm ready.

438
00:26:36,096 --> 00:26:40,057
Actually, it reminds me of when I went
kayaking down the Pearl River to Zhongshan.

439
00:26:40,142 --> 00:26:44,144
It's just beautiful.
A lot of places, just like this.

440
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,271
You have a fascinating job.

441
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,899
- Come on. So do you, Jeff.
- Yes.

442
00:26:48,984 --> 00:26:50,614
I'm sure you could tell me some stories.

443
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,323
I could tell you some stories
to make your skin crawl.

444
00:26:53,822 --> 00:26:55,197
But I'm in HR.

445
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:57,116
There's a certain wall
of secrecy around me, so...

446
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:58,991
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me.

447
00:27:00,996 --> 00:27:02,621
I'd probably just get in trouble
from corporate.

448
00:27:02,706 --> 00:27:04,998
You wouldn't actually kill me.
It's just an expression.

449
00:27:05,083 --> 00:27:07,000
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

450
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:08,836
- Here we go. All right.
- Okay.

451
00:27:08,921 --> 00:27:11,213
Look at all these
little ethnic condiments.

452
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:12,631
- So cool.
- That is...

453
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,299
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

454
00:27:14,384 --> 00:27:15,394
Try this.

455
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:17,435
Okay.

456
00:27:20,307 --> 00:27:21,727
Wow! That's good!

457
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,518
What is that? That looks like a snake.

458
00:27:24,603 --> 00:27:25,602
Shéjiû, man.

459
00:27:25,687 --> 00:27:26,895
Snake wine.

460
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,020
That's real cobra.

461
00:27:28,857 --> 00:27:30,566
The alcohol neutralizes most of the venom.

462
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:32,276
Yeah, in Guangdong, the old dudes say

463
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:35,362
you drink snake wine,
makes your sack hang real low, man.

464
00:27:35,447 --> 00:27:36,777
Does it?

465
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:39,329
Do you have a Arnold Palmer by chance?

466
00:27:41,495 --> 00:27:42,995
You guys want to hear
about tonight's offering?

467
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,330
Yes. Show us what you got. Thank you.

468
00:27:46,917 --> 00:27:48,787
Where did you find this place? Yelp?

469
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,961
It's my job to find places like this.

470
00:27:51,046 --> 00:27:54,089
I talk to people, I go places.
And when I find a place that I like,

471
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,674
I like to share it with people I like.

472
00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:58,302
Shéjiû! Okay, that's a live snake!

473
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,095
Yes, Jeff. It's a snake restaurant.

474
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,850
Yeah, but Panda Express,
they don't serve panda.

475
00:28:04,142 --> 00:28:05,309
Do they?

476
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:07,603
They call this "the 100-pace viper,"

477
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:10,481
because if it bites you, that's how
far you're gonna get, man.

478
00:28:10,566 --> 00:28:11,940
- Is that true?
- No!

479
00:28:12,025 --> 00:28:13,567
It's not true.

480
00:28:13,652 --> 00:28:14,902
It's probably closer to 50 paces,

481
00:28:14,987 --> 00:28:16,945
- honestly. It's very potent.
- Pretty bad, man.

482
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,865
I'm afraid of snakes.
I'll eat 'em. But, I'm so sorry.

483
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,825
Ricky knows what he's doing.
He's very good at his job.

484
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:24,453
Come on, sit down, okay?
Just let him do his thing.

485
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:25,621
- Yes.
- You're in good hands.

486
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,326
- Yes.
- Okay? Trust me.

487
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:31,251
You're gonna wanna keep
your hands away from the head,

488
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,876
'cause it can actually still bite you.
So, just be very careful.

489
00:28:34,214 --> 00:28:35,714
Can I have a vegetable spring roll?

490
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,299
Buddy...

491
00:28:37,384 --> 00:28:38,717
You're gonna be just fine. Here.

492
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,094
- A little more of that.
- Yeah.

493
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:41,259
- Yeah.
- Okay? This is good.

494
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,018
- We might need another bottle of this.
- Yeah.

495
00:28:48,103 --> 00:28:49,978
Let's go ahead and get loosened up.

496
00:28:50,063 --> 00:28:52,113
- Yeah. Snake it up.
- Yeah.

497
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:00,322
One second. That's Karen. Hello?

498
00:29:00,407 --> 00:29:02,658
Remember I told you something
was off about the Joneses?

499
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,451
Well, my instincts were right.

500
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:07,663
I just followed Natalie to the mall
and I have two words for you.

501
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:09,288
Sarah Palin.

502
00:29:10,042 --> 00:29:11,041
And guess what?

503
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:13,456
There is a Chinese word
for cul-de-sac. It's...

504
00:29:14,505 --> 00:29:16,839
I'm sorry, I'm having
a hard time hearing you.

505
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:19,634
The point is, the Joneses
are not who they say they are.

506
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:26,275
Okay. Hold on. I'm sorry.

507
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:31,812
Karen, I'm actually,
lunching with Tim right now.

508
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:35,477
There's nothing weird
going on whatsoever. I think...

509
00:29:36,235 --> 00:29:38,485
I think you're just sublimating
your anxiety about the kids.

510
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,863
You're having insecurities
about, you know, your career...

511
00:29:40,948 --> 00:29:42,368
Don't even begin to go there!

512
00:29:42,991 --> 00:29:44,199
I don't throw your man crush in your face.

513
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:47,369
I don't have a man crush!
I don't have a man crush.

514
00:29:47,454 --> 00:29:50,205
I had it once in my life,
when I was a boy.

515
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,540
- You mean Bruce?
- She likes to be called Caitlyn.

516
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,450
No, no, no, you're absolutely right.

517
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,114
- Hello, Karen.
- Natalie!

518
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:25,489
What a surprise!

519
00:30:26,034 --> 00:30:28,035
You've got no clothes on.
You're on the phone.

520
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,700
I'm gonna go.

521
00:30:30,831 --> 00:30:32,421
To be continued.

522
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,417
I was just leaving Tim a voice mail.

523
00:30:38,422 --> 00:30:40,922
He likes to hear from me
when I'm trying on lingerie.

524
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,353
I tell him what I'm putting on,
how it looks.

525
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:48,602
How it makes me feel.

526
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:52,309
It looks great! I'm sure he...
I'm sure he's happy to know that.

527
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:54,269
Tell him from me.

528
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:58,774
Yeah, it's one of our things.
Keeps the spark alive.

529
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:00,818
Do you and Jeff have a thing?

530
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:03,570
Yes, Jeff and I have a thing.

531
00:31:03,655 --> 00:31:05,025
We...

532
00:31:06,033 --> 00:31:08,913
We do it really fast in case
the kids come running into our room.

533
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:12,714
Sounds like you're very sexual people.

534
00:31:13,373 --> 00:31:16,667
- But your kids are gone, aren't they?
- Yeah. Yeah.

535
00:31:16,752 --> 00:31:19,922
Time for something new.
Is that why you're buying lingerie?

536
00:31:21,006 --> 00:31:22,464
Yes.

537
00:31:22,549 --> 00:31:24,425
Let's see what you decided on.

538
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,136
No. I mean, I just... It's just stuff.

539
00:31:27,221 --> 00:31:29,561
Come on. Show me what you think is sexy.

540
00:31:30,224 --> 00:31:31,598
They're for Jeff's mom.

541
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:33,809
She's morbidly obese.
She drives around on a scooter.

542
00:31:33,894 --> 00:31:35,354
I feel really bad for...

543
00:31:36,522 --> 00:31:38,062
Let's be real with one another, okay?

544
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:44,111
And he's dating Sheila Rondowski,
I think is her name, on the sly,

545
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,946
which is a big no-no,
'cause she's his superior.

546
00:31:46,031 --> 00:31:47,030
Sure.

547
00:31:47,115 --> 00:31:48,740
This stuff is so good, Tim.
It's delicious.

548
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,534
Didn't I tell you?

549
00:31:50,619 --> 00:31:54,121
I tell ya... Listen. It is impressive
how people open up to you.

550
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:56,248
- They tell you a lot.
- They do.

551
00:31:56,333 --> 00:31:57,541
It sounds like they complain a lot, but...

552
00:31:57,626 --> 00:32:00,919
Gosh! It comes with the territory.
I'm fine with it. But, yes.

553
00:32:01,004 --> 00:32:02,045
Let me ask you this.

554
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:07,801
Does anybody ever say to you in confidence
how much they hate the company?

555
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:09,636
Ricky, let's get some more wine!

556
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:11,638
Hold a grudge? Anything like that?

557
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:14,725
Sara Patel, she has
irritable bowel syndro...

558
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,977
Excuse me. She has
irritable bowel syndrome.

559
00:32:17,062 --> 00:32:19,521
There's a lot of co-workers,
too, that sit near the bathroom.

560
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,648
Sometimes, we're all irritated
by your bowels, Sara.

561
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:23,358
Everybody on the fourth floor knows.

562
00:32:23,443 --> 00:32:24,610
But that's not what I'm talking about.

563
00:32:24,695 --> 00:32:26,528
Is there ever a situation
where somebody seems

564
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:28,113
like they came into a lot of money,

565
00:32:28,198 --> 00:32:30,574
or they, you know,
they bought a new car or new clothes?

566
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:32,075
- Looks like they won the lottery?
- Yes.

567
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,410
- Or hit the jackpot?
- Yeah.

568
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:35,579
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Sanjay. He bought a Grillbot.

569
00:32:35,664 --> 00:32:36,754
What's that?

570
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,168
That's the guy I work with.
His name's Sanjay.

571
00:32:41,253 --> 00:32:43,921
No, I know what Sanjay is.
What's a Grillbot?

572
00:32:44,006 --> 00:32:46,590
Grillbot is like... It's just a...

573
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:49,760
It's just a... What it is, is a robot
that cleans your barbecue grill.

574
00:32:49,845 --> 00:32:51,845
You just put it in your grill,
you shut the lid,

575
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:55,474
and it just kind of ruminates in there
and gets all the little coal pieces,

576
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:58,310
the little icky pieces up.
And it's, you know, spick and span!

577
00:32:58,395 --> 00:32:59,895
It's like a Roomba for your grill.

578
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:04,316
I'm thinking more of like the...
Like, like... More expensive.

579
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,944
These are $99, Tim. Expensive stuff.

580
00:33:07,029 --> 00:33:08,278
Right.

581
00:33:08,363 --> 00:33:10,531
But you gotta make sure the grill's
off. Sanjay didn't do that.

582
00:33:10,616 --> 00:33:12,491
Are we done talking about the Grillbot?

583
00:33:12,576 --> 00:33:14,076
If you're not gonna eat this,
I'm gonna eat this.

584
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,994
No, no, no, go ahead. Take what you like.

585
00:33:16,079 --> 00:33:17,287
The thing is,

586
00:33:17,372 --> 00:33:20,712
is he voided the warranty
on the Grillbot and the grill.

587
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:24,128
Jesus, Jeff! Ricky!

588
00:33:24,213 --> 00:33:25,671
Oh, God! Put it down. Ricky!

589
00:33:25,756 --> 00:33:27,506
Man! I've never seen that before.

590
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:28,757
Go find the shot!

591
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,050
The antivenom. Go get it!

592
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:31,218
Hey, little buddy!

593
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:34,054
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no. No, no. Hey.

594
00:33:34,139 --> 00:33:35,139
He's snacking on my hand.

595
00:33:35,224 --> 00:33:36,723
Look at me!

596
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:37,975
All right. Get it out!

597
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,230
We're all gonna
have to have a relationship.

598
00:33:40,771 --> 00:33:43,939
Hold on. We're gonna get the antivenom
okay, Jeff? Hold on a second.

599
00:33:44,024 --> 00:33:45,944
You got it? All right. Hold on, hold on.

600
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:50,110
How does that feel, buddy?
How does that feel?

601
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,658
That's good.

602
00:33:54,743 --> 00:33:57,119
Now this would be incredible on you.

603
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,624
Perfect, I'll take it.

604
00:33:59,289 --> 00:34:01,206
You're not being fun, Karen.

605
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:05,801
I want you to forget everything you
heard about functional breast support.

606
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,377
Why are you so nervous?

607
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:14,555
Is it because we're two women
trying on lingerie together?

608
00:34:16,598 --> 00:34:19,099
Or because I know
you were following me today?

609
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,602
I wasn't following. What? No! No!

610
00:34:21,687 --> 00:34:24,271
I was at the mall. I was shopping.
I wonder if they have this in yellow.

611
00:34:24,356 --> 00:34:26,816
- Jeff's favorite color is yellow.
- I'm not stupid, Karen.

612
00:34:27,442 --> 00:34:28,572
You're right to follow me.

613
00:34:30,028 --> 00:34:32,908
To be thinking that this woman
is not who she pretends to be.

614
00:34:34,533 --> 00:34:36,283
Because I'm hiding something.

615
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:38,077
You are?

616
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:40,661
So are you.

617
00:34:41,623 --> 00:34:44,374
We're so alike, you and I.

618
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:49,254
Two strong, sexually vibrant women.
And yet, here we are.

619
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:53,092
Forced to bury our true selves
from the Meg Craverstons of the world.

620
00:34:53,177 --> 00:34:54,968
What's Meg got to do with this?

621
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:56,261
Come on, Karen.

622
00:34:56,346 --> 00:34:59,098
I hear the way she talks about me
when she thinks I'm not looking.

623
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:01,016
Hating me for the way I look,

624
00:35:01,101 --> 00:35:05,481
as if perfect bone structure and
flawless skin is something I can help!

625
00:35:06,857 --> 00:35:09,977
I may not need to moisturize,
but I still have feelings.

626
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,950
I didn't know about the feelings.

627
00:35:14,948 --> 00:35:17,533
That's why women like us
need to stick together.

628
00:35:17,618 --> 00:35:19,448
Not follow each other in malls.

629
00:35:20,621 --> 00:35:21,911
Do you Kegel?

630
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:23,664
Kegel?

631
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:25,916
You mean the exercises for the lady parts?

632
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:28,419
Strength has to start somewhere.

633
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:30,514
Not... I don't.

634
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:34,589
In fact, I'm doing some right now.

635
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:40,846
I could crack a walnut down there,
if I needed to.

636
00:35:41,642 --> 00:35:42,933
Have you ever had any need to?

637
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:44,018
Now you go.

638
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:48,359
- I couldn't crack anything down there.
- Are we still hiding?

639
00:35:48,982 --> 00:35:52,234
Come on, Karen.
Just... channel your power.

640
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,739
Okay. I'll do it. I'll try.

641
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,411
I did it! I felt it!

642
00:36:02,496 --> 00:36:03,746
How was that?

643
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:05,497
Work in progress.

644
00:36:05,582 --> 00:36:07,712
Now, you have a choice.

645
00:36:10,546 --> 00:36:12,006
Which Karen do you wanna be?

646
00:36:13,257 --> 00:36:14,627
Karen, the meek?

647
00:36:17,636 --> 00:36:19,136
Or Karen, the strong?

648
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,480
- Sure you're okay?
- I'm okay. Yeah.

649
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:25,888
You saved my life.

650
00:36:27,354 --> 00:36:28,734
And that was some good snake.

651
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,030
I'm embarrassed though.

652
00:36:32,818 --> 00:36:34,234
Little drunk.

653
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:36,403
You had me worried there for a second.

654
00:36:36,488 --> 00:36:38,318
Get yourself cleaned up.
I'll get the check.

655
00:36:38,949 --> 00:36:40,369
I know what you're doing, Tim.

656
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,036
What am I doing, Jeff?

657
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:46,041
I read people for a living.
That's what I do.

658
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,875
And, you know, you get me drunk
on snake wine

659
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,050
and get me to open up
and tell you secrets.

660
00:36:53,755 --> 00:36:54,915
You...

661
00:36:56,675 --> 00:36:58,585
are trying to make a friend.

662
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:02,513
I got a lot of friends, Jeff.

663
00:37:02,598 --> 00:37:05,308
Yeah, but you have a lot
of secrets locked inside of you.

664
00:37:05,934 --> 00:37:08,944
I think that's why you might be one
of the loneliest guys I've ever met.

665
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:13,821
Now, what do you have to say about that?

666
00:37:15,694 --> 00:37:17,154
You wanna know something about me?

667
00:37:21,742 --> 00:37:24,082
Sometimes I hate what I do for a living.

668
00:37:26,455 --> 00:37:28,247
But doesn't that feel good?

669
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:30,172
To express yourself?

670
00:37:36,965 --> 00:37:39,550
- Is this us bonding now?
- No, this is us talking.

671
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:41,677
You want bonding? I'll show you bonding.

672
00:37:41,762 --> 00:37:44,388
You're gonna look at me.
I'm gonna button you up.

673
00:37:44,473 --> 00:37:47,273
Okay. Okay. That's loud.

674
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:58,694
Jesus, you do this for fun?

675
00:37:58,779 --> 00:38:00,409
I got you, okay?

676
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:14,626
Isn't this a blast?

677
00:38:14,711 --> 00:38:15,841
Yeah!

678
00:38:38,819 --> 00:38:41,403
- Hey, Karen! Karen?
- Hey, I'm here!

679
00:38:41,488 --> 00:38:43,697
Hi, Karen. How are you?
I brought you some flowers.

680
00:38:43,782 --> 00:38:45,365
Thank you, honey!

681
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,367
You're not gonna believe
the day that I had.

682
00:38:47,452 --> 00:38:49,787
Guess who likes being
a man-bird as much as I do?

683
00:38:49,872 --> 00:38:51,038
- Who?
- Tim Jones.

684
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:52,539
Look at that. Why are you wearing
a robe? Are you sick?

685
00:38:52,624 --> 00:38:56,668
Nice. Honey, I'm just thinking.
What am I really doing this summer?

686
00:38:56,753 --> 00:39:00,756
I mean, I sent the kids away to camp,
I'm redesigning bathrooms.

687
00:39:00,841 --> 00:39:02,299
Is that what makes me happy?

688
00:39:02,384 --> 00:39:04,934
Is that what makes me,
Karen Gaffney, complete?

689
00:39:05,554 --> 00:39:08,555
Okay, well, listen,
if you wanna feel complete,

690
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,724
there's some exercises
I do at work with the guys...

691
00:39:10,809 --> 00:39:12,810
Honey, no. They don't work.

692
00:39:12,895 --> 00:39:15,905
Now, I've lost touch with the real Karen.

693
00:39:16,523 --> 00:39:19,233
And then these amazing
new neighbors move in

694
00:39:19,318 --> 00:39:21,652
and with me feeling so vulnerable,
it's only natural

695
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:24,321
that I would get suspicious
and find fault with them.

696
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:29,076
But really, I just feel like
I should be focusing on me.

697
00:39:29,161 --> 00:39:30,451
And on us.

698
00:39:34,458 --> 00:39:36,083
Sweet baby Jesus, what's happening?

699
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:38,794
Natalie said we needed a thing
to keep our spark alive.

700
00:39:38,879 --> 00:39:40,421
You've been talking to Natalie
about us sexually?

701
00:39:40,506 --> 00:39:42,965
No, obviously.
I didn't tell her anything, honey.

702
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,467
No, I just mean she's unusually intuitive.

703
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,677
- For a Greek.
- Right.

704
00:39:46,762 --> 00:39:48,595
And she just thinks
that once you're married

705
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,848
at a certain point,
you have to make more of an effort.

706
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:53,350
This is the Karen that I...
This is the Karen that I love.

707
00:39:53,435 --> 00:39:55,519
I really do. Take me.

708
00:39:55,604 --> 00:39:57,364
Take me, darling.

709
00:39:58,357 --> 00:39:59,437
Okay.

710
00:40:02,903 --> 00:40:04,403
Shoot, honey.

711
00:40:05,948 --> 00:40:07,698
It was the conversation piece.

712
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,657
Don't worry about it.

713
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:15,831
What is that?

714
00:40:15,916 --> 00:40:17,583
I don't know. It doesn't matter. Come on.

715
00:40:17,668 --> 00:40:18,998
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

716
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:22,212
You know what, honey?
We need to go back to our lovemaking.

717
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:23,547
- Where were we?
- Yeah, okay.

718
00:40:23,632 --> 00:40:26,132
- It's so hot! It's so hot!
- Yeah. Okay, I... Should I grope you?

719
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:28,260
- Great!
- Yeah.

720
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:30,846
Let's go back. Jeff, Jeff!

721
00:40:30,931 --> 00:40:33,682
- It's so hot!
- So, you are sick?

722
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,976
You know what?
I'll tell you what we should do.

723
00:40:36,061 --> 00:40:38,645
We should put on a soundtrack
for our passion.

724
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,273
You want a little passion music?
This calls for The Judds.

725
00:40:41,358 --> 00:40:43,609
- We're gonna put on some music.
- Okay.

726
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:45,611
I'm going to put the wine glasses
in the dishwasher.

727
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:47,488
Right. Okay, so you got...
You wanna narrate!

728
00:40:47,573 --> 00:40:49,031
Okay. All right. I got you. So...

729
00:40:49,116 --> 00:40:51,446
And then... This is so much fun!

730
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,703
The blood leaves Jeff's head

731
00:40:54,788 --> 00:40:57,289
and slowly makes its way
to his midsection.

732
00:40:57,374 --> 00:40:58,916
I don't know why we're in the closet.

733
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,167
- It seems very un-erotic to me.
- Honey, listen!

734
00:41:00,252 --> 00:41:02,127
Listen! Because our neighbors bugged us!

735
00:41:02,212 --> 00:41:04,171
Told you something was wrong with them.

736
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,590
Makes a little more sense
what Tim was doing in your den.

737
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:07,800
And do not tell me that he had to poop.

738
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:10,177
He did not have to go number two.

739
00:41:10,262 --> 00:41:12,222
And now I know what Natalie
was doing at the café.

740
00:41:13,348 --> 00:41:14,556
It was a drop!

741
00:41:14,641 --> 00:41:16,558
A drop? What are you talking about?

742
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:18,185
I can't believe she duped me
into this lingerie.

743
00:41:18,270 --> 00:41:20,312
But she was in her underwear
and I was in my underwear and...

744
00:41:20,397 --> 00:41:22,940
Oh, my God! She was so persuasive.

745
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:24,775
Wait. You were both in your
underwear at the same time?

746
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,652
Get your mind out of the gutter!
It was a charade!

747
00:41:26,737 --> 00:41:29,863
Okay, Karen, I just wanna make sure
this isn't another case of paranoia.

748
00:41:29,948 --> 00:41:31,740
Remember the time you made me sleep in
the car 'cause I ate that hot pepper

749
00:41:31,825 --> 00:41:33,117
and you thought I was possessed?

750
00:41:33,202 --> 00:41:35,452
Your eyes were all red. You were
trying to have sex on a school night.

751
00:41:35,537 --> 00:41:37,871
I know, but it was just the jalapeeno.
That's my point.

752
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,706
God! We gotta call the cops!

753
00:41:39,791 --> 00:41:41,792
Call the cops and tell them what?
Our neighbors bugged the house?

754
00:41:41,877 --> 00:41:43,168
- Yes!
- That sounds crazy!

755
00:41:43,253 --> 00:41:44,920
What happens when we really need the cops?

756
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:46,422
They won't come to our house. Why?

757
00:41:46,507 --> 00:41:48,757
Because we're on some kind
of crazy list. That's crazy.

758
00:41:48,842 --> 00:41:50,342
You're right. We need more evidence.

759
00:41:51,345 --> 00:41:54,435
- And it's a jalapeño.
- Karen. Karen!

760
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,099
Karen!

761
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:02,020
Kar... Karen, look.

762
00:42:02,105 --> 00:42:05,524
I know that you miss Mikey and Patrick,
but parents weekend is not for two weeks.

763
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:06,608
Get down!

764
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,444
Parents weekend isn't for two weeks.

765
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:11,071
Maybe we can do some
breathing exercises to center you.

766
00:42:11,156 --> 00:42:14,696
Jeff, I don't need to do any deep
breathing exercises! I'm centered!

767
00:42:15,244 --> 00:42:16,584
It's quiet over there.

768
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,410
It's too quiet.

769
00:42:20,082 --> 00:42:21,832
They're probably watching us,
watching them.

770
00:42:21,917 --> 00:42:25,167
They're not watching us! They're at
a restaurant with Stacey Chung.

771
00:42:25,963 --> 00:42:27,004
How do you know that?

772
00:42:27,089 --> 00:42:29,548
Because we talked about it
at the indoor skydiving place!

773
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,175
Why didn't you tell me?

774
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,885
Karen, stop!

775
00:42:32,970 --> 00:42:35,220
Darling, stop, please!
Think about what you're doing.

776
00:42:35,305 --> 00:42:36,472
You'll go to jail for something like this.

777
00:42:36,557 --> 00:42:37,598
Only if I get caught.

778
00:42:37,683 --> 00:42:39,558
See? No fingerprints.

779
00:42:39,643 --> 00:42:41,894
Now, people move in,
they always change the locks,

780
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:44,021
but they never change the garage remote.

781
00:42:44,106 --> 00:42:46,607
I forgot to give it back when Bridget
and Dave went to Myrtle Beach

782
00:42:46,692 --> 00:42:47,862
and asked me to feed Smokey.

783
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:56,408
Are you coming?
You're gonna need to cover your hands.

784
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:58,285
Cover my hands? With what?

785
00:42:58,370 --> 00:42:59,500
Use your socks.

786
00:43:01,623 --> 00:43:03,923
Oh, God! It looks like a show home.

787
00:43:05,377 --> 00:43:08,417
- They painted over Bridget's mural.
- That's a real tragedy.

788
00:43:09,882 --> 00:43:12,092
Look, there's nothing weird here.
Let's go, let's go!

789
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:16,848
Karen! There are windows everywhere.
Get down! Get down!

790
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:19,018
So weird.

791
00:43:20,392 --> 00:43:21,432
Stand up!

792
00:43:24,146 --> 00:43:26,396
These pots have never seen
a lick of flame.

793
00:43:26,481 --> 00:43:28,649
Little weird for someone
with a cooking blog?

794
00:43:28,734 --> 00:43:31,568
Well, it's a new house, new pots.
It makes sense to me.

795
00:43:31,653 --> 00:43:34,655
And an empty spice rack. She wows
the neighbors with her appetizers.

796
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:35,781
No spices.

797
00:43:35,866 --> 00:43:38,283
Never judge a woman
by her spice rack, Karen.

798
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:39,993
Check for stuff about Sri Lankan orphans.

799
00:43:40,078 --> 00:43:41,748
I bet that's another web of lies!

800
00:43:47,628 --> 00:43:50,254
Sorry, Tim, for breaking into your house.

801
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:52,089
I just wanted to be your friend.

802
00:43:52,174 --> 00:43:53,590
This certainly isn't a friendly gesture.

803
00:43:53,675 --> 00:43:55,592
You know what, honey? I can hear you.

804
00:43:55,677 --> 00:43:57,553
And it hurts my feelings
when you're not supportive.

805
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:59,308
Karen, this is ridiculous!

806
00:44:00,098 --> 00:44:01,978
It's gotta be here somewhere.

807
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:06,770
Karen! Karen, Karen, Karen!

808
00:44:07,689 --> 00:44:09,569
Look at them. So perfect.

809
00:44:17,824 --> 00:44:18,874
Karen, come on, let's go.

810
00:44:19,535 --> 00:44:20,701
Look at this.

811
00:44:20,786 --> 00:44:22,616
Okay. So, they're gamers. Let's go.

812
00:44:29,503 --> 00:44:31,423
Karen! Don't! What are you doing?

813
00:44:32,714 --> 00:44:35,048
Stacey Chung.
Isn't she out with the Joneses?

814
00:44:35,133 --> 00:44:36,133
Yeah.

815
00:44:37,052 --> 00:44:38,093
Ted Wallace.

816
00:44:38,178 --> 00:44:39,636
He works with you, right?

817
00:44:39,721 --> 00:44:42,765
Yeah. Maybe it's just some
kind of social media thing.

818
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,183
Dhameer Mustafa?

819
00:44:44,268 --> 00:44:45,808
There's Dan.

820
00:44:46,436 --> 00:44:47,436
Sanjay.

821
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:57,159
Oh, God! They're targeting MBI.

822
00:44:58,782 --> 00:45:00,115
There's some kind of missile.

823
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,950
These are all the people
he was asking me about.

824
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:04,161
Oh, my God! I told him everything.

825
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:05,704
- Oh, God.
- We've gotta go.

826
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:06,789
Switch down the computer, honey.

827
00:45:06,874 --> 00:45:08,248
We gotta get out of here.

828
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:11,210
I can't get any purchase on the mouse
because I have a sock hand.

829
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,377
- Okay, hold on.
- Switch it off! Put it back.

830
00:45:12,462 --> 00:45:14,004
- Karen...
- Put it back the...

831
00:45:14,089 --> 00:45:16,215
No! You don't understand! They're spies.

832
00:45:16,300 --> 00:45:18,717
- Karen, please, okay? Just shh!
- We gotta go right now!

833
00:45:18,802 --> 00:45:19,885
I need to write these names down.

834
00:45:19,970 --> 00:45:21,261
What are you doing? We gotta go!

835
00:45:21,346 --> 00:45:23,847
They could be back at any second.

836
00:45:23,932 --> 00:45:24,932
What are you staring at?

837
00:45:25,684 --> 00:45:26,850
What is that? A pen?

838
00:45:26,935 --> 00:45:27,975
What?

839
00:45:28,937 --> 00:45:29,937
- What?
- You have a...

840
00:45:32,357 --> 00:45:35,484
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Now what?

841
00:45:35,569 --> 00:45:36,860
Oh, shit, I killed her.

842
00:45:36,945 --> 00:45:38,235
Karen!

843
00:45:38,906 --> 00:45:40,239
Karen!

844
00:45:40,324 --> 00:45:41,365
Thank God!

845
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:42,490
Honey.

846
00:45:45,746 --> 00:45:47,656
Okay, we gotta go. Karen, wake up!

847
00:45:56,924 --> 00:45:57,974
Oh, God.

848
00:45:58,467 --> 00:46:00,887
Okay. Okay. Damn!

849
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:07,057
Sorry. Sorry.

850
00:46:07,142 --> 00:46:09,522
- You're welcome, baby.
- Okay.

851
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:14,190
- You're so cute!
- Karen, shh!

852
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:17,568
Okay. Okay.

853
00:46:17,653 --> 00:46:20,993
Why are you shushing me?
They haven't any dogs.

854
00:46:26,203 --> 00:46:29,580
I thought Chili's
was supposed to be fancy.

855
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:31,625
Yeah, I don't think you ordered well.

856
00:46:33,961 --> 00:46:35,836
Remember when we were in college,

857
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:39,339
and your parents, they almost caught
us in the bushes, and we hid!

858
00:46:39,424 --> 00:46:41,049
Yeah.

859
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:42,644
Wait, I met you after college.

860
00:46:44,221 --> 00:46:46,263
Oh, my God!

861
00:46:46,348 --> 00:46:47,973
It's almost like our wedding night.

862
00:46:48,058 --> 00:46:49,975
Why did we do that? What are we doing?

863
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,059
What do we do?

864
00:46:51,144 --> 00:46:53,314
Jeff, you're being so serious!

865
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:56,984
- I'm Jeff. I'm so serious.
- Karen, Karen, Karen!

866
00:46:57,860 --> 00:46:59,440
- Why are you being so serious?
- Okay.

867
00:47:00,988 --> 00:47:02,112
- Stop licking me!
- Yeah.

868
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:03,447
Okay, listen. Oh, shit!

869
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:05,491
Shit.

870
00:47:06,702 --> 00:47:08,202
- I'm getting on top!
- I...

871
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,328
I'm getting on top.

872
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:10,954
- Karen! Karen! Karen!
- I'm on top!

873
00:47:11,039 --> 00:47:12,915
That makes me feel weird. Karen, please.

874
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,833
I'm not into this right now, sweetheart.

875
00:47:14,918 --> 00:47:16,628
I'm not really into this.

876
00:47:17,379 --> 00:47:19,671
- Cuddle me.
- No cuddling! Our neighbors are spies!

877
00:47:19,756 --> 00:47:22,174
- Our neighbors are spies.
- I wanna cuddle. Cuddle me.

878
00:47:22,259 --> 00:47:24,176
Look at them up there.

879
00:47:24,261 --> 00:47:27,601
Probably going upstairs to make sex,
and they won't even think about us.

880
00:47:29,057 --> 00:47:31,137
You broke my heart, Tim Jones.

881
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:34,560
You broke my heart.

882
00:47:35,272 --> 00:47:37,439
I'm just saying,
the place is called Chili's.

883
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:38,649
- It's a Mexican place.
- I can't believe...

884
00:47:38,734 --> 00:47:40,275
- I don't know why you would...
- ...we're still talking about that.

885
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,735
...order anything remotely Asian.

886
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:45,322
Okay. I guess we can cross off Stacey.

887
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:46,949
She's not going to give us anything.

888
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:49,294
Hey, do you know what a Grillbot is?

889
00:47:50,245 --> 00:47:51,328
What?

890
00:47:51,413 --> 00:47:53,288
It's this thing. Jeff was telling me
about it the other day.

891
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,500
It's this little robot
that cleans your barbecue...

892
00:47:56,585 --> 00:47:58,505
I hope this is not going to be a problem.

893
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:00,515
What?

894
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:09,304
First rule of what we do. Don't get
too close to your targets. Remember?

895
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:10,556
Actually...

896
00:48:10,641 --> 00:48:14,521
the first rule of what we do, is to
not fall in love with your partner.

897
00:48:15,687 --> 00:48:18,564
Right? Wasn't that the first rule?

898
00:48:18,649 --> 00:48:19,979
Tim Jones.

899
00:48:21,568 --> 00:48:23,738
What am I going to do with you?

900
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,947
I don't know.

901
00:48:27,032 --> 00:48:28,282
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

902
00:48:28,367 --> 00:48:30,242
- I have a few ideas.
- I have some ideas too.

903
00:48:30,327 --> 00:48:31,368
You do?

904
00:48:31,453 --> 00:48:34,253
- Should I start now?
- Yes, you should.

905
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:39,675
Okay. Okay.

906
00:48:48,804 --> 00:48:50,814
Well, that might be a problem.

907
00:48:59,273 --> 00:49:00,898
Hey, buddy. Can I use your computer?

908
00:49:00,983 --> 00:49:02,983
I need to check
my fantasy baseball roster.

909
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:04,234
Go ahead. Go ahead.

910
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:05,319
Thanks.

911
00:49:15,372 --> 00:49:18,207
What is happening?

912
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,793
You okay, Jeff? You seem kind of distant.

913
00:49:20,878 --> 00:49:22,586
No, I'm fine. I'm just...

914
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:25,921
sifting through the wreckage
of every value I once held dear.

915
00:49:27,301 --> 00:49:30,101
Good. I was worried
it might be something real.

916
00:49:34,433 --> 00:49:35,563
Hey, Dan.

917
00:49:36,935 --> 00:49:38,395
Dan!

918
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:49,159
The Joneses aren't who they say they are.

919
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,070
What are you talking about?

920
00:49:52,868 --> 00:49:53,868
Your phone.

921
00:49:54,578 --> 00:49:56,448
Okay. Okay.

922
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:00,457
The Joneses are spies.

923
00:50:00,542 --> 00:50:01,632
Spies?

924
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:07,589
Spies?

925
00:50:07,674 --> 00:50:11,009
Yes! They planted a bug in our house.

926
00:50:11,094 --> 00:50:17,524
I can't believe I let Tim diaper me

927
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:20,436
dupe me

928
00:50:20,521 --> 00:50:23,730
Have you told anyone?

929
00:50:23,815 --> 00:50:26,316
I'm meeting with Carl Pronger in Security

930
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:28,610
But it's not like that, I swear!

931
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,113
Sometimes she picks up on things.
This time she was right.

932
00:50:31,198 --> 00:50:32,531
You have to take this upstairs, Carl!

933
00:50:32,616 --> 00:50:35,701
This company, my neighborhood,

934
00:50:35,786 --> 00:50:39,406
Western civilization as we know it,
they're all at risk.

935
00:50:41,792 --> 00:50:43,542
And it might be my fault.

936
00:50:48,173 --> 00:50:49,465
All right, Gaffney. I'll do some digging.

937
00:50:49,550 --> 00:50:50,716
Okay. Thank you.

938
00:50:50,801 --> 00:50:52,551
See what I can learn about these devices.

939
00:50:52,636 --> 00:50:55,763
And if I find out they're real,
and not from some hobby shop,

940
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:58,558
- well, you wait for my call.
- Okay.

941
00:51:26,712 --> 00:51:27,753
Go for Jeff.

942
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:30,339
I gotta say, Gaffney,
you and your wife were right.

943
00:51:30,424 --> 00:51:34,176
You know those devices you gave me?
I was talking to a friend of mine.

944
00:51:34,261 --> 00:51:35,636
Ex-military.

945
00:51:35,721 --> 00:51:38,806
And well, this line is unsecured,
so I can't go into details,

946
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:42,768
but let me just say,
this stuff is the real shit!

947
00:51:42,853 --> 00:51:46,188
God! Okay. Who are the Joneses
working for? Are they Russian?

948
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:47,439
Damn it, Gaffney.

949
00:51:47,524 --> 00:51:49,942
What is it about the word
"unsecured" that you don't get?

950
00:51:50,027 --> 00:51:51,693
Look, I'm gonna do some more digging,

951
00:51:51,778 --> 00:51:53,946
and then you meet with me
before work tomorrow.

952
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:55,447
Okay.

953
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:57,449
You know the old MBI building? On 75?

954
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,701
7:00 a.m. Just look for the van.

955
00:51:59,786 --> 00:52:00,994
Why are we meeting there?

956
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:04,373
Well, so we can strategize
before we take it upstairs!

957
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:06,667
My buddy says the last time
he saw tech like that

958
00:52:06,752 --> 00:52:08,335
was on a dead man.

959
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,500
Dead man? Why would you say...

960
00:52:10,923 --> 00:52:11,923
Jesus!

961
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:16,142
"Jesus" is right.

962
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,847
Gaffney, this is the big time!
I mean, we are going all the way.

963
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:22,099
- Not now, Carl. Not now.
- Don't try to give me the brush off.

964
00:52:22,184 --> 00:52:23,851
If you think you're gonna
handle this yourself...

965
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:26,056
- Okay, okay.
- ...you're making a big mistake!

966
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:29,690
- Work buddy.
- Gaffney, don't mess this up!

967
00:52:29,775 --> 00:52:33,075
- Carl! Okay, yeah. Good.
- 7:00 a.m. Bring lattes...

968
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,405
You okay there, buddy?
You almost ran me over.

969
00:52:36,490 --> 00:52:39,158
Yeah, I was looking for Bernie.
He keeps pooping

970
00:52:39,243 --> 00:52:41,243
in my yard and I was just...
I mean, his dogs keep

971
00:52:41,328 --> 00:52:44,368
pooping in my yard. I was distracted.

972
00:52:44,831 --> 00:52:45,914
How are you?

973
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:47,374
You don't seem like yourself, Jeff.

974
00:52:47,459 --> 00:52:48,834
You don't seem like yourself, Tim.

975
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:50,210
What's that supposed to mean?

976
00:52:50,295 --> 00:52:53,255
I was... You said it to me. I was...
What did you mean when you said it?

977
00:52:54,091 --> 00:52:55,883
We think we had a break-in last night.

978
00:52:55,968 --> 00:52:58,343
- What?
- Yeah. I know. Really rocks your

979
00:52:58,428 --> 00:53:00,138
faith in the notion of trust, doesn't it?

980
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:02,639
Tell me about it. My gosh!

981
00:53:02,724 --> 00:53:03,766
You'd think in a neighborhood like this

982
00:53:03,851 --> 00:53:05,309
you wouldn't have to worry
about something like that.

983
00:53:05,394 --> 00:53:06,904
I'm so sorry about that, Tim.

984
00:53:07,896 --> 00:53:10,516
Yeah, well, Jeff,
here's the thing about trust.

985
00:53:11,275 --> 00:53:15,455
Once it's gone, bad things happen.

986
00:53:16,488 --> 00:53:17,698
I heard that.

987
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:20,073
Okay, well, I should go.

988
00:53:20,158 --> 00:53:21,738
Karen and I are supposed to take a bath.

989
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,053
Yeah, a little warning.
Carl can be a bit prickly,

990
00:53:41,138 --> 00:53:43,639
but he's a top notch security man
and he happens to like the way

991
00:53:43,724 --> 00:53:45,734
- your mind thinks, okay?
- Okay.

992
00:53:47,019 --> 00:53:50,399
Is that him in the bathrobe
hanging laundry?

993
00:53:51,064 --> 00:53:53,274
I don't know.
Maybe he's having a yard sale.

994
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,028
Gaffney, right on time!

995
00:53:58,113 --> 00:54:01,073
And you brought the lattes.
Knew I could count on you.

996
00:54:01,158 --> 00:54:03,951
This is my wife Carl.
I mean, this is my wife, Carl.

997
00:54:04,036 --> 00:54:05,077
Nice to meet you.

998
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:06,161
- Nice to meet you.
- Karen Gaffney.

999
00:54:06,246 --> 00:54:08,622
Yeah, well, welcome
to my home away from home.

1000
00:54:08,707 --> 00:54:10,874
Or to be more accurate, my home.

1001
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:13,877
But not for long. Here, please. Thank you.

1002
00:54:13,962 --> 00:54:15,045
Sit down here.

1003
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,840
Let me just clear this stuff away.

1004
00:54:18,258 --> 00:54:19,798
Get this laundry outta here.

1005
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:23,804
It's the maid's day off.

1006
00:54:23,889 --> 00:54:26,056
Not at all. It's just that

1007
00:54:26,141 --> 00:54:29,810
when you told us to meet you at the van,
I didn't realize you'd be living in it.

1008
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:31,687
Yeah, well, the truth is...

1009
00:54:31,772 --> 00:54:33,814
you know, I've been living
in the old Westfalia here

1010
00:54:33,899 --> 00:54:37,192
ever since my wife left me
and took everything I had.

1011
00:54:37,277 --> 00:54:39,069
- Sorry, Carl.
- That's terrible.

1012
00:54:39,154 --> 00:54:41,780
And now thanks to you for bringing me
in on this deal, Jeff.

1013
00:54:41,865 --> 00:54:44,241
I think things are finally
starting to break my way again!

1014
00:54:44,326 --> 00:54:45,576
What do you have for us?

1015
00:54:45,661 --> 00:54:48,291
Oh, boy, what have I got?
Let me show you here.

1016
00:54:48,789 --> 00:54:51,790
You know, here's something that Jeff
never thought he'd hear. Gaffney...

1017
00:54:51,875 --> 00:54:54,535
are you ready for a level four
security clearance?

1018
00:54:55,879 --> 00:54:58,380
- Okay.
- Okay. Here we go.

1019
00:54:58,465 --> 00:54:59,715
- Carl.
- Yeah?

1020
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,884
You got like a red dot on your forehead.

1021
00:55:01,969 --> 00:55:03,849
It's called adult acne.
Thank you very mu...

1022
00:55:06,431 --> 00:55:07,473
God!

1023
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:08,557
I've been hit!

1024
00:55:08,642 --> 00:55:10,772
I've been hit! I've been hit!

1025
00:55:12,187 --> 00:55:14,855
Oh, my God! Shit.

1026
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,148
- Are you hurt?
- I've been shot!

1027
00:55:16,233 --> 00:55:18,317
God! No, honey, it's just the latte!

1028
00:55:18,402 --> 00:55:20,112
It burns! It burns!

1029
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,069
Oh, shit! It's the Joneses!

1030
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,325
Try not to shoot them.

1031
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:27,990
Let's run for Carl's house.

1032
00:55:28,787 --> 00:55:30,367
Oh, God!

1033
00:55:34,668 --> 00:55:36,085
Get in the car! Now!

1034
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,460
Let us get on with
our stupid little lives!

1035
00:55:41,717 --> 00:55:44,802
Get in the car now
and I will explain everything. Mostly.

1036
00:55:44,887 --> 00:55:46,929
I'm tired of your
silver-tongued lies, Jones!

1037
00:55:47,014 --> 00:55:49,389
Do you wanna get killed
out here? Get in the car!

1038
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:51,016
Why? So you could kill us in there?

1039
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:53,521
There were no spices in your spice rack!

1040
00:55:54,313 --> 00:55:57,106
I said get in the car.

1041
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,821
We're gonna get in the car.

1042
00:55:59,318 --> 00:56:01,860
For Patrick and Mikey. Right, honey?

1043
00:56:01,945 --> 00:56:03,946
Guys, now. It is very dangerous. Now!

1044
00:56:04,031 --> 00:56:06,365
When I count to three
we're gonna run, okay?

1045
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,450
One... Two...

1046
00:56:09,036 --> 00:56:10,035
Jeff!

1047
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,995
- Oh, my God!
- I said three!

1048
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,249
Jeff, please, would you
just get in the car?

1049
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:16,333
I was making a head start!

1050
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:17,584
On your wife?

1051
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:18,710
You two are acting like children
right now.

1052
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:21,171
Now, get in the car.
Right now. Get in this car.

1053
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:24,091
Put your seat belt on, for Christ's sake.

1054
00:56:24,176 --> 00:56:25,175
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

1055
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:26,890
- Go, go, go.
- Let's go, let's go.

1056
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:29,805
What is going on here, Tim?

1057
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:31,181
Are you stealing secrets from MBI?

1058
00:56:31,266 --> 00:56:32,933
We're not stealing secrets from you.

1059
00:56:33,018 --> 00:56:34,560
- There they are.
- I see them.

1060
00:56:34,645 --> 00:56:36,103
We're spies.

1061
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:37,604
His seat belt is jammed! Pull over.

1062
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:40,190
- Shut up!
- Jeff gets car sick in the back!

1063
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:41,855
- Quiet!
- Shut up!

1064
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:46,864
You broke into our house.

1065
00:56:46,949 --> 00:56:48,657
What kind of neighbors are you?

1066
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:51,082
You planted a bug in our house.
What kind of neighbors are you?

1067
00:56:51,787 --> 00:56:53,617
You know, they kind of have a point.

1068
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:55,622
It's so hot in here.

1069
00:56:55,707 --> 00:56:56,790
- Put the AC on. Please!
- No.

1070
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,000
Can you turn
the air conditioner on, please?

1071
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:00,305
- It's not going on!
- It's hot.

1072
00:57:07,219 --> 00:57:09,049
My seat belt's not on! Wait!

1073
00:57:17,271 --> 00:57:18,896
Okay, it's about to get weird.

1074
00:57:18,981 --> 00:57:20,691
About to get weird?

1075
00:57:34,204 --> 00:57:36,924
Quick question. Are you guys
the good guys or bad guys?

1076
00:57:37,666 --> 00:57:38,707
What do you think?

1077
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:40,918
- I think the guys in black...
- Shit!

1078
00:57:41,003 --> 00:57:43,513
...on the motorcycles shooting at us
might be the bad guys.

1079
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:47,091
Get down, get down, get down!

1080
00:57:58,645 --> 00:57:59,935
What is that?

1081
00:58:00,731 --> 00:58:01,772
It's camp.

1082
00:58:01,857 --> 00:58:03,107
What?

1083
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:05,282
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

1084
00:58:06,028 --> 00:58:08,153
- The cookies are for both of you.
- Karen!

1085
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:10,656
Mikey, if you split it,
he gets to choose first.

1086
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:12,331
- Karen!
- Because that's fair!

1087
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:16,036
Get down! Get down.
Karen, get off the phone!

1088
00:58:16,121 --> 00:58:18,205
Because otherwise you would
make one piece bigger.

1089
00:58:18,290 --> 00:58:20,332
And then you'd pick that one.
Put Mikey on, put...

1090
00:58:20,417 --> 00:58:22,337
Just split the cookie!
Just split the cookie!

1091
00:58:24,505 --> 00:58:25,555
Oh, shit!

1092
00:58:48,946 --> 00:58:50,362
To the right, Natalie.

1093
00:58:50,447 --> 00:58:51,527
Thanks, Karen.

1094
00:58:53,492 --> 00:58:54,532
Brake!

1095
00:58:58,372 --> 00:58:59,832
Oh, my God!

1096
00:59:04,753 --> 00:59:07,383
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1097
00:59:11,885 --> 00:59:13,302
Please get out of the way.

1098
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:15,717
Please get out of the way so I can see.

1099
00:59:36,368 --> 00:59:38,908
There's something blinking on the back
of the car. Is that bad?

1100
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:41,622
Yes, Jeff, that is decidedly bad.

1101
00:59:41,707 --> 00:59:43,415
You need to go out there
and take that off.

1102
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:45,751
- Wha... I need to take it off?
- Yes!

1103
00:59:45,836 --> 00:59:47,294
- Well, can you slow down?
- No!

1104
00:59:47,379 --> 00:59:49,088
- I'm driving. We're being chased.
- Get it off!

1105
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:50,506
I'm not gonna slow down.
They're trying to kill us!

1106
00:59:50,591 --> 00:59:52,721
Right. Coming from the guy who
wouldn't turn on the air conditioner.

1107
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:55,928
Slow down a little bit.

1108
00:59:56,013 --> 00:59:58,097
I'm getting wet! I'm getting wet!

1109
00:59:58,182 --> 01:00:00,022
Getting wet is better than getting shot!

1110
01:00:04,021 --> 01:00:05,061
It's hot!

1111
01:00:11,028 --> 01:00:12,402
Three targets, two shots. You got this?

1112
01:00:12,487 --> 01:00:13,777
Always.

1113
01:00:14,448 --> 01:00:16,528
How you doing back there, Jeff?
We need you, buddy.

1114
01:00:19,161 --> 01:00:20,451
Wait.

1115
01:00:21,246 --> 01:00:22,826
- Okay.
- Wait.

1116
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:24,956
Now.

1117
01:00:25,709 --> 01:00:27,751
I got it! I got it! Now what?

1118
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:28,876
Hold on, Jeff!

1119
01:00:35,844 --> 01:00:37,014
Throw it! Throw it!

1120
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:52,276
Five here? So, what do you think?
I think I'm stuck.

1121
01:00:52,361 --> 01:00:55,696
Yeah. Well, I think one, two, three,
four, five... It's gotta be six.

1122
01:00:55,781 --> 01:00:57,030
Here we go, folks.

1123
01:00:57,115 --> 01:00:59,116
- Scrambled whites with toast.
- Thank you.

1124
01:00:59,201 --> 01:01:01,535
- Three-egg omelet with potatoes.
- Thank you!

1125
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:04,246
Eggs, potatoes, and bacon.
And a side of bacon.

1126
01:01:04,331 --> 01:01:06,581
- Yum, yum, yum, yum!
- Thank you very much.

1127
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,042
Oh, my goodness!

1128
01:01:12,631 --> 01:01:16,011
What? High speed car chases
make me hungry, honey.

1129
01:01:17,261 --> 01:01:21,305
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if that's
who, you know, you really are.

1130
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,270
I have a couple of questions. And...

1131
01:01:23,976 --> 01:01:26,101
I think this time
we kind of deserve the truth.

1132
01:01:26,186 --> 01:01:27,811
You're entitled to it.

1133
01:01:27,896 --> 01:01:29,855
Okay, question number one.

1134
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,190
Are you in the CIA?

1135
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:35,243
Honey, that's a wasted question.
They can't answer that.

1136
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:37,948
Question number two then.
Who are you after?

1137
01:01:38,824 --> 01:01:39,824
We can't tell you.

1138
01:01:40,659 --> 01:01:42,951
Okay. Question number three.
Is it somebody we know?

1139
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,036
Can't say that, either.

1140
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:46,121
You just said we were
entitled to the truth.

1141
01:01:46,206 --> 01:01:48,040
Did say you were entitled to it.
Doesn't mean we can give it to you.

1142
01:01:48,125 --> 01:01:49,166
You know what, honey?

1143
01:01:49,251 --> 01:01:51,085
It's probably classified.
That's why they can't tell us.

1144
01:01:51,170 --> 01:01:53,837
- Do you want any of this?
- Yeah. I'll have some potatoes.

1145
01:01:53,922 --> 01:01:58,092
I'm glad everybody's just enjoying
their meal while we're in the middle

1146
01:01:58,177 --> 01:02:00,427
of a... like, a thing!

1147
01:02:00,512 --> 01:02:02,429
You guys are just eating
like there's nothing going on.

1148
01:02:02,514 --> 01:02:04,064
I'm a little troubled by it!

1149
01:02:06,810 --> 01:02:08,977
Honey! That is not okay.

1150
01:02:09,062 --> 01:02:12,231
Fine. I'll keep asking 'til I get
something that's not classified.

1151
01:02:12,316 --> 01:02:13,315
Is that fine with you?

1152
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,400
Okay.

1153
01:02:18,238 --> 01:02:19,905
Question 17.

1154
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:22,780
After a shootout like that,
who cleans up all the bullets?

1155
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:26,198
Okay, can you guys
tell us anything at all?

1156
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,666
I'm not Greek. I'm Israeli.

1157
01:02:30,751 --> 01:02:31,751
Ex-Mossad?

1158
01:02:32,336 --> 01:02:33,335
Can't tell you.

1159
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,710
Come on. Are you guys even married?

1160
01:02:35,339 --> 01:02:36,629
Can you even tell us that?

1161
01:02:37,591 --> 01:02:39,133
Yes. That actually you can't fake.

1162
01:02:39,218 --> 01:02:41,798
But that's it? Everything else was a lie?

1163
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,057
I mean, 'cause I think when you
told me that you hated your job,

1164
01:02:47,142 --> 01:02:49,393
that seemed real. I mean,
from an HR perspective.

1165
01:02:49,478 --> 01:02:51,148
That seemed real.

1166
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,280
You told him you hate your job?

1167
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:03,782
I may have mentioned
certain misgivings, in confidence.

1168
01:03:03,867 --> 01:03:05,242
Interesting.

1169
01:03:05,327 --> 01:03:06,577
Why is this coming out now?

1170
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:10,122
Because Jeff is actually a good listener.

1171
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:13,041
And I did mention that
to you before, in Marrakesh.

1172
01:03:13,126 --> 01:03:15,126
At that place that
we always go to. Hazim's.

1173
01:03:16,004 --> 01:03:17,671
That day, we spent the whole
afternoon there.

1174
01:03:17,756 --> 01:03:20,382
We talked about maybe getting
out of this. We talked about

1175
01:03:20,467 --> 01:03:23,594
I could actually become
a travel writer, for real.

1176
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:24,887
We could maybe have a child.

1177
01:03:24,972 --> 01:03:26,930
That was hypothetical.
It wasn't a life plan.

1178
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,307
I didn't think it...

1179
01:03:28,392 --> 01:03:30,434
Okay, this is what we do.
Automatically, we go to Hebrew

1180
01:03:30,519 --> 01:03:32,269
and then it's gonna be a whole thing.

1181
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:34,104
And who puts a bug in a glass sculpture?

1182
01:03:34,189 --> 01:03:36,774
I happen to like my glass sculptures
and I like to share them with people.

1183
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:38,442
It's a legitimate thing.
It's actually appropriate

1184
01:03:38,527 --> 01:03:40,694
to give somebody a gift.
What isn't appropriate,

1185
01:03:40,779 --> 01:03:43,947
however, is what you happened
to wear at the yard party.

1186
01:03:44,032 --> 01:03:46,200
Now you want me to dress
like some kind of a sexless

1187
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:47,493
- elementary school nurse...
- Come on. I'm not talking...

1188
01:03:47,578 --> 01:03:49,036
...just to fit in with
the other mothers, right?

1189
01:03:49,121 --> 01:03:50,120
- No offense, Karen.
- You look great!

1190
01:03:50,205 --> 01:03:52,456
You look amazing. But you have to fit in.

1191
01:03:52,541 --> 01:03:54,458
I mean, it's called being undercover.

1192
01:03:54,543 --> 01:03:57,753
I mean, you had no problem
wearing a burqa in Kabul.

1193
01:03:57,838 --> 01:03:58,837
But this is the suburbs!

1194
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:02,091
It's hard. Don't you get it?
Women here are vicious.

1195
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:04,006
Can I say? You don't know the women here.

1196
01:04:04,928 --> 01:04:06,011
There you go.

1197
01:04:06,096 --> 01:04:07,137
We don't know anything.

1198
01:04:07,222 --> 01:04:08,555
Why did you bug our house?

1199
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,140
Actually, you know less than nothing.

1200
01:04:10,225 --> 01:04:12,226
But the agency received credible intel

1201
01:04:12,311 --> 01:04:15,270
that someone was using your
work computer to commit treason

1202
01:04:15,355 --> 01:04:16,815
against the United States of America.

1203
01:04:17,941 --> 01:04:20,234
We were using you
to get to whoever they are.

1204
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:21,401
Why not tell him everything?

1205
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:22,646
Who cares?

1206
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:25,572
Ten years, 30 countries,
nobody finds us out,

1207
01:04:25,657 --> 01:04:28,325
and we couldn't even
last a week in suburbia!

1208
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:29,830
Can I pay, please?

1209
01:04:45,302 --> 01:04:47,511
Stupid question. What do we do now?

1210
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:48,637
Yeah, what do we do now?

1211
01:04:48,722 --> 01:04:50,264
Just stick to your routine.

1212
01:04:50,349 --> 01:04:52,850
And nobody finds out
about any of this, okay?

1213
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:54,518
I won't tell anybody.

1214
01:04:54,603 --> 01:04:55,644
Yeah, keep it quiet.

1215
01:04:55,729 --> 01:04:57,438
There's this other thing I needed to ask.

1216
01:04:57,523 --> 01:05:01,525
I know you guys are undercover and
this whole thing is a setup, but...

1217
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,651
The other day at the Cobra Club,

1218
01:05:02,736 --> 01:05:05,446
was that about getting me drunk
and having me betray my co-workers

1219
01:05:05,531 --> 01:05:10,826
or was that about two guys, you know,
maybe starting a friendship?

1220
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,961
It was about getting you drunk
and betraying your co-workers.

1221
01:05:14,790 --> 01:05:16,623
Okay. Yeah.

1222
01:05:16,708 --> 01:05:18,168
But the indoor skydiving...

1223
01:05:20,712 --> 01:05:21,712
that was about being friends.

1224
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:24,548
See, I told you we bonded.

1225
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:27,259
Okay. Remember,
nobody finds out about this.

1226
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:29,684
- No. I won't even tell my mom.
- Locking it up. Hey, hey.

1227
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:34,518
One other thing. I know I'm not
a licensed therapist, okay?

1228
01:05:35,352 --> 01:05:38,562
But talk, communicate
with one another, okay?

1229
01:05:38,647 --> 01:05:40,857
Jeff is big on communication.

1230
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:42,858
I communicate. That's what I do.

1231
01:05:42,943 --> 01:05:44,610
- You sure do.
- Talk, talk, talk.

1232
01:05:44,695 --> 01:05:47,205
No, no, no, no, no.
You're absolutely right, Jeff.

1233
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:50,195
Communication is a great thing.

1234
01:05:51,451 --> 01:05:53,869
- All right, I'll see you.
- Bye!

1235
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:55,662
- Thanks!
- I should go.

1236
01:05:55,747 --> 01:05:56,747
- Okay. Take care.
- See you.

1237
01:05:57,499 --> 01:06:00,129
That's so nice of you
to tell them that, honey. Really.

1238
01:06:02,296 --> 01:06:04,129
I think the Joneses
are going to be just fine.

1239
01:06:04,214 --> 01:06:05,474
Yeah.

1240
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:15,060
- After you, my dear.
- Thank you.

1241
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:30,875
Timmy!

1242
01:06:54,264 --> 01:06:57,184
Well, it was most likely
just a gas leak. So...

1243
01:06:58,101 --> 01:07:00,102
Well, thank you for your statements.

1244
01:07:00,187 --> 01:07:01,727
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.

1245
01:07:06,527 --> 01:07:08,152
Okay.

1246
01:07:08,237 --> 01:07:10,696
Whoever killed the Joneses
are gonna come after us next.

1247
01:07:10,781 --> 01:07:13,740
Do you think we did the right thing
by lying to the police?

1248
01:07:13,825 --> 01:07:16,118
We promised the Joneses
that we wouldn't say anything.

1249
01:07:16,203 --> 01:07:17,786
Do you think that promises count, honey,

1250
01:07:17,871 --> 01:07:19,538
when the people that we made
them to are dead?

1251
01:07:19,623 --> 01:07:20,713
Yes!

1252
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:22,750
Plus, I don't wanna be haunted.

1253
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,465
- They've taken the barricades down.
- Oh, my God!

1254
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:31,258
All right, listen,
I'm gonna grab the essentials.

1255
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:32,468
We're gonna need our passports.

1256
01:07:32,553 --> 01:07:33,635
We're gonna need our birth certificates.

1257
01:07:33,720 --> 01:07:34,720
And we'll need some duct tape.

1258
01:07:34,805 --> 01:07:35,971
Get some peppercorns, too!

1259
01:07:36,056 --> 01:07:37,806
- Mikey...
- Coffee, teas, Goldfish.

1260
01:07:38,350 --> 01:07:39,730
I'm gonna get these onions here.

1261
01:07:40,602 --> 01:07:42,728
- Don't take the onions, put 'em back.
- No, no, no, no.

1262
01:07:42,813 --> 01:07:44,271
- You don't need onions.
- I need...

1263
01:07:44,356 --> 01:07:46,482
- Trail mix!
- I can't choose.

1264
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:48,147
This is a 2,000-piece puzzle.

1265
01:07:48,777 --> 01:07:51,236
- This is a weapon.
- Yeah! Or we can make chicken parm.

1266
01:07:51,321 --> 01:07:52,404
- It would be nice to have...
- What! You always buy this.

1267
01:07:52,489 --> 01:07:54,072
You should buy the organic one.
I've been through this with you.

1268
01:07:54,157 --> 01:07:55,616
I don't wanna talk about that right now.

1269
01:07:55,701 --> 01:07:57,493
Jeff, don't take the ginger snaps!

1270
01:07:57,578 --> 01:07:58,952
I know, but we might need...

1271
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,657
- Calm down, Jeff.
- Okay!

1272
01:08:01,582 --> 01:08:02,672
I'm taking this Red Bull.

1273
01:08:04,835 --> 01:08:05,918
Where are we going?

1274
01:08:06,003 --> 01:08:07,044
I don't know. Anywhere. Just pack!

1275
01:08:07,129 --> 01:08:08,545
I've never been on the run before.

1276
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,090
I mean, should I take a bikini,
in case it's gonna get hot?

1277
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:14,093
No! A bathing suit? Take socks!
Socks! I need my socks.

1278
01:08:14,178 --> 01:08:16,178
We gotta get the kids.
We gotta get my mom!

1279
01:08:16,263 --> 01:08:18,222
Don't bring her into this!
We said twice a year.

1280
01:08:18,307 --> 01:08:19,387
Christmas and Easter!

1281
01:08:20,559 --> 01:08:21,599
Oh, God! Okay. Okay.

1282
01:08:23,854 --> 01:08:26,230
- Okay. You know what?
- Karen.

1283
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:27,695
It's probably just a fuse.

1284
01:08:28,650 --> 01:08:32,486
Because a house exploded, it could
just be a problem with the grid.

1285
01:08:32,571 --> 01:08:33,570
Yeah.

1286
01:08:33,655 --> 01:08:35,114
Maybe you should check
the fuse box, honey.

1287
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,865
- Okay, yeah.
- And I'm gonna just...

1288
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,370
stay here and pack.

1289
01:08:40,037 --> 01:08:43,080
Maybe you should
go with me to the fuse box.

1290
01:08:43,165 --> 01:08:45,585
That way you're not alone.

1291
01:08:47,044 --> 01:08:48,460
Okay, here we go.

1292
01:08:48,545 --> 01:08:50,671
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. There we go.

1293
01:08:50,756 --> 01:08:52,256
There it is. There it is.

1294
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:54,340
Okay.

1295
01:08:56,637 --> 01:08:57,803
It was just the circuit breaker.

1296
01:08:57,888 --> 01:08:59,763
- It's okay.
- Good Lord!

1297
01:08:59,848 --> 01:09:02,391
Don't scream. It's not what you think.

1298
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:05,266
What, you didn't kidnap our friends
and tie them to chairs?

1299
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:09,232
It is what you think. But it's
not for the reasons you think.

1300
01:09:10,567 --> 01:09:13,947
Dan is the one selling secrets from MBI.

1301
01:09:14,363 --> 01:09:15,404
What?

1302
01:09:15,489 --> 01:09:17,030
- You're right. She's very good.
- Told you.

1303
01:09:17,115 --> 01:09:18,525
Dan, is that true?

1304
01:09:19,493 --> 01:09:21,368
And how are you two alive?
Your house exploded.

1305
01:09:21,453 --> 01:09:24,538
Jeff, things aren't always what they seem.

1306
01:09:24,623 --> 01:09:26,083
You should know that by now.

1307
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:45,601
So?

1308
01:09:45,686 --> 01:09:47,811
How could you not tell me
you were feeling this way?

1309
01:09:47,896 --> 01:09:48,896
Well, look...

1310
01:09:48,981 --> 01:09:51,565
To be honest, you are not exactly
the easiest woman in the world

1311
01:09:51,650 --> 01:09:54,026
- for a man to admit his fears to.
- What?

1312
01:09:54,111 --> 01:09:57,279
How can you say that to me?
I'm compassionate and sensitive.

1313
01:09:57,364 --> 01:09:58,574
You can say anything to me.

1314
01:10:00,367 --> 01:10:03,117
Well, calling me a pussy
in Hebrew is not helping things.

1315
01:10:08,584 --> 01:10:09,834
Run.

1316
01:10:19,219 --> 01:10:21,345
You dove headfirst
through a plate glass window?

1317
01:10:21,430 --> 01:10:23,347
It's not as hard as it seems.

1318
01:10:23,432 --> 01:10:25,349
Who's behind all this?
Who's trying to kill you?

1319
01:10:25,434 --> 01:10:28,936
It's an international arms dealer
who calls himself The Scorpion.

1320
01:10:29,021 --> 01:10:31,105
The Agency's been after him for years.

1321
01:10:31,190 --> 01:10:34,030
And your friends here
were about to sell him these.

1322
01:10:38,197 --> 01:10:39,277
That's what we make at MBI?

1323
01:10:40,115 --> 01:10:42,449
- What are these?
- Microchips.

1324
01:10:42,534 --> 01:10:44,660
In the wrong hands,
the information on those chips

1325
01:10:44,745 --> 01:10:47,621
could be used to undermine the entire
U.S. missile defense system.

1326
01:10:47,706 --> 01:10:50,876
For the last three months, Dan's been
smuggling them out of the building.

1327
01:10:51,919 --> 01:10:52,960
Prison-style.

1328
01:10:53,045 --> 01:10:54,920
Wait. Prison-style? What do you mean?

1329
01:10:55,005 --> 01:10:58,006
I think that means he put 'em in
a balloon and stuck 'em up his butt.

1330
01:10:58,091 --> 01:10:59,341
What?

1331
01:11:00,135 --> 01:11:01,715
Oh, God!

1332
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,096
Why did you do this, Dan?

1333
01:11:04,181 --> 01:11:08,481
That's exactly what
we're about to find out, Jeff.

1334
01:11:11,313 --> 01:11:12,443
Yeah.

1335
01:11:13,732 --> 01:11:15,023
Tim!

1336
01:11:15,108 --> 01:11:17,068
Spread your legs, Danny boy.

1337
01:11:17,986 --> 01:11:19,653
Mrs. Jones has some work to do.

1338
01:11:19,738 --> 01:11:21,238
Natalie...

1339
01:11:21,323 --> 01:11:23,991
Jesus. Jeff. Jeff, please, do something!

1340
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:25,075
Either you talk...

1341
01:11:25,160 --> 01:11:26,535
Jeff, stop her please! She's a psychopath!

1342
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:30,080
Tim, can I just have a word with
you guys for one second, please?

1343
01:11:30,165 --> 01:11:32,040
Please don't hurt me. Please.

1344
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:33,876
- Okay, okay.
- Get this psycho away from me, Jeff.

1345
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:34,960
Relax.

1346
01:11:35,045 --> 01:11:37,796
We're excited that
you guys are still alive.

1347
01:11:37,881 --> 01:11:41,717
But this is our basement. This is not
a Abu Ghraib, you know, scenario here.

1348
01:11:41,802 --> 01:11:43,969
- Our kids play down here.
- I don't like it either.

1349
01:11:44,054 --> 01:11:45,763
But this is a national security situation.

1350
01:11:45,848 --> 01:11:48,974
Yeah, but you can't torch a man's
scrotum and expect him to speak.

1351
01:11:49,059 --> 01:11:50,100
You'd be surprised.

1352
01:11:50,185 --> 01:11:54,021
These are human beings.
You gotta connect with them, okay?

1353
01:11:54,106 --> 01:11:56,266
- Let me talk to 'em for two minutes.
- He's a people person.

1354
01:11:57,109 --> 01:11:58,279
You have 90 seconds.

1355
01:11:59,736 --> 01:12:00,816
Okey-dokey.

1356
01:12:08,745 --> 01:12:10,245
Okay, Meg.

1357
01:12:16,795 --> 01:12:18,505
Dan, I want you to know...

1358
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:22,473
like the HR department, this basement
is a place of non-judgment, okay?

1359
01:12:23,218 --> 01:12:27,763
And even though you stole from the company
and betrayed your country and cul-de-sac,

1360
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:31,683
and, you know, placed microchips
in your darkest cavity,

1361
01:12:31,768 --> 01:12:32,768
mistakes happen!

1362
01:12:32,853 --> 01:12:36,233
Oh, my God! Can we please waterboard
them and get this over with?

1363
01:12:37,024 --> 01:12:38,482
We live in confusing times.

1364
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:42,069
And I think that the lines between
right and wrong become blurry.

1365
01:12:42,154 --> 01:12:44,988
It's hard to even know what those
words mean, isn't it, Dan?

1366
01:12:45,073 --> 01:12:47,074
What is this? Good cop, good cop?

1367
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:49,743
Look, I might not know
what's going on, on the sixth floor,

1368
01:12:49,828 --> 01:12:53,956
but did you know that every time
an employee requests a raise

1369
01:12:54,041 --> 01:12:55,499
it comes through the HR department?

1370
01:12:55,584 --> 01:12:57,000
And I've seen your requests.

1371
01:12:57,085 --> 01:13:01,295
And I know that they've been denied,
every time, for the last five years.

1372
01:13:02,382 --> 01:13:05,801
That's a lot of time, Dan. Lot of
good time you gave to the company?

1373
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:08,637
- Where's your piece of the pie?
- Exactly.

1374
01:13:08,722 --> 01:13:11,598
You know how hard it is to raise
four children on a rocket scientist's salary?

1375
01:13:11,683 --> 01:13:13,517
Oh, God! Shut up, you idiot!

1376
01:13:13,602 --> 01:13:15,811
No! You shut up, Lady Macbeth!

1377
01:13:15,896 --> 01:13:16,937
Okay.

1378
01:13:17,022 --> 01:13:18,772
You're the one who pushed me
into this, you know that?

1379
01:13:18,857 --> 01:13:21,733
With all your constant demands
and trendy needs.

1380
01:13:21,818 --> 01:13:25,487
I did not tell you to go on Jeff's computer
and make a deal with an arms dealer!

1381
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:27,282
Well, you didn't tell me not to.

1382
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:30,287
Jeff...

1383
01:13:31,036 --> 01:13:32,866
I was at the end of my rope.

1384
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:37,332
The financial pressure was crazy.
Groceries and tutors and...

1385
01:13:37,417 --> 01:13:40,497
I got four kids under 13 in braces.

1386
01:13:41,588 --> 01:13:43,088
Do you understand? Do you, Jeff?

1387
01:13:43,173 --> 01:13:46,675
I do. You know I do. I mean...

1388
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,553
if kids have crooked teeth, we can't
have crooked teeth in this society.

1389
01:13:49,638 --> 01:13:52,222
This isn't Great Britain, you know?

1390
01:13:52,307 --> 01:13:55,392
There's all sorts of things
you have to keep up with and...

1391
01:13:55,477 --> 01:13:59,810
New tires for the minivan, piano lessons,
you know, and, because all that...

1392
01:14:02,317 --> 01:14:04,067
Carl Pronger is dead!

1393
01:14:04,152 --> 01:14:06,862
Hang on! Get a hold of yourself!

1394
01:14:06,947 --> 01:14:09,615
I never wanted anyone
to get hurt, Jeff, I swear.

1395
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,241
We were protecting you.

1396
01:14:11,326 --> 01:14:13,702
The Scorpion doesn't even
know who you are. Karen!

1397
01:14:13,787 --> 01:14:16,330
Shut up, Meg! Brooklyn Loft is stupid.

1398
01:14:16,415 --> 01:14:17,456
All right, not helping.

1399
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:18,582
I'm crying.

1400
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:19,708
Where did you get an onion?

1401
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:21,126
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, you.

1402
01:14:21,211 --> 01:14:23,551
I got it from upstairs. From our kitchen.

1403
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:32,930
Is this your phone?
Is this the Scorpion calling?

1404
01:14:33,015 --> 01:14:34,389
I'm gonna answer this
and you're gonna talk to him.

1405
01:14:34,474 --> 01:14:35,891
And you're gonna lead us to him.

1406
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:37,434
He'll sniff me out in a second.
You know what he's capable of.

1407
01:14:37,519 --> 01:14:39,770
- Answer the phone now.
- Natalie...

1408
01:14:39,855 --> 01:14:40,979
No more games.

1409
01:14:41,064 --> 01:14:44,525
Look, I can't. I'm not a spy!
I'm a soccer dad!

1410
01:14:44,610 --> 01:14:45,984
He never misses a game.

1411
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:47,861
Oh, my God. All right,
I'm gonna answer it.

1412
01:14:47,946 --> 01:14:49,696
No, we can't.
Our cover was blown, remember?

1413
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:50,906
Well, I don't have a lot of options.

1414
01:14:50,991 --> 01:14:52,281
What do you want me to do?

1415
01:14:56,997 --> 01:14:58,080
Hello?

1416
01:14:58,165 --> 01:15:00,255
Hello? Mr. Rascal Flatts?

1417
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:04,423
I needed a cover name.

1418
01:15:05,088 --> 01:15:06,213
Hello?

1419
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:07,468
Hi!

1420
01:15:08,383 --> 01:15:10,592
Yes, this is Rascal.

1421
01:15:10,677 --> 01:15:12,967
Are you and your wife
ready to make the deal?

1422
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:19,601
Yes, Mrs. Flatts and I
are very excited about it.

1423
01:15:19,686 --> 01:15:22,936
Tomorrow night.
The Odyssey Hotel. 9:00 p.m.

1424
01:15:23,857 --> 01:15:27,359
Go to the V-Bar.
A table will be reserved for you.

1425
01:15:27,444 --> 01:15:29,862
Bring the requested item and wait.

1426
01:15:29,947 --> 01:15:32,781
V-Bar. Okay thank you very much.

1427
01:15:32,866 --> 01:15:35,406
Just out of curiosity,
is there a dress code?

1428
01:15:37,579 --> 01:15:39,709
I'll... I can look that up online.

1429
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:41,916
Okay.

1430
01:15:43,919 --> 01:15:44,918
What have I done?

1431
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:48,297
No, no. You did everything great!
You did everything great.

1432
01:15:48,382 --> 01:15:49,423
- Okay.
- You did!

1433
01:15:49,508 --> 01:15:51,675
- I did.
- Jeff and Karen, welcome to

1434
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,469
the sexy and exciting world

1435
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:56,474
of international espionage
and covert operations.

1436
01:15:59,935 --> 01:16:02,060
Buddy, I think it's time
we get you in a proper suit.

1437
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,146
Nice! Is it an extra medium?

1438
01:16:04,231 --> 01:16:05,941
A killer dress.

1439
01:16:06,733 --> 01:16:07,733
That's all of it?

1440
01:16:07,818 --> 01:16:10,486
This tie has been fitted
with a miniature surveillance mic.

1441
01:16:10,571 --> 01:16:12,738
It's completely undetectable.

1442
01:16:12,823 --> 01:16:15,115
I don't know if I can walk in these.

1443
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:19,495
The heel is equipped with a tracking device
that allows us to monitor your every move.

1444
01:16:19,580 --> 01:16:22,581
Natalie and I will secure
a position right upstairs on the roof.

1445
01:16:22,666 --> 01:16:24,750
And establish a command center.

1446
01:16:24,835 --> 01:16:27,628
Now, you know at some point,
you're gonna have to put on pants.

1447
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:29,838
Yeah. I know. I'm just nervous still.

1448
01:16:29,923 --> 01:16:30,964
It's gonna be okay.

1449
01:16:31,049 --> 01:16:32,633
Simple in and out job.

1450
01:16:32,718 --> 01:16:34,843
Make the exchange, leave the hotel.

1451
01:16:34,928 --> 01:16:38,347
Got it. In and out. Just out of curiosity,

1452
01:16:38,432 --> 01:16:41,142
what happens, you know,
worst-case scenario?

1453
01:16:41,977 --> 01:16:43,644
Worst-case scenario?

1454
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:45,813
We radio for backup,
and we storm the place

1455
01:16:45,898 --> 01:16:48,018
with the full force
of the United States government.

1456
01:16:48,692 --> 01:16:49,983
Okay. Got it.

1457
01:16:50,068 --> 01:16:51,485
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1458
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:54,530
You look good. Don't forget those pants.

1459
01:17:20,307 --> 01:17:21,637
Reminds me of our first date.

1460
01:17:23,894 --> 01:17:25,064
And our second.

1461
01:17:27,814 --> 01:17:28,864
What's wrong?

1462
01:17:30,984 --> 01:17:34,069
We never really did finish
that conversation, did we?

1463
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:36,697
Well, the house did explode.

1464
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:38,032
So...

1465
01:17:39,159 --> 01:17:43,120
Look, I just want you to know
I realized something last night

1466
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:45,375
when I was about to fry Dan's testicles.

1467
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:49,915
I know I'm not the best listener,
but I can change.

1468
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,588
What? You don't think I can?

1469
01:17:52,673 --> 01:17:55,093
No, no, no. I know you can.

1470
01:17:59,096 --> 01:18:00,846
Just don't change too much, okay?

1471
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:04,231
Okay.

1472
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,074
Honey, are you ready? What are you doing?

1473
01:18:21,159 --> 01:18:23,577
I was just listening
to some Rascal Flatts.

1474
01:18:23,662 --> 01:18:25,496
- Trying to get into character.
- Oh, God!

1475
01:18:25,581 --> 01:18:27,748
Patrick leaves these toys on the stairs.

1476
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:30,883
- Somebody's gonna hurt themselves.
- Karen!

1477
01:18:32,129 --> 01:18:33,754
What? Do you like it? Is it too much?

1478
01:18:33,839 --> 01:18:36,006
No! Not at all. It's just enough.

1479
01:18:36,091 --> 01:18:37,091
Thanks, honey.

1480
01:18:37,176 --> 01:18:38,926
Is this the lingerie
you were wearing the other day?

1481
01:18:39,011 --> 01:18:41,095
Yeah, I figured if we're gonna
do this, I should do it right.

1482
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,140
Yeah.

1483
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:47,392
- You look so handsome.
- Thank you very much.

1484
01:18:47,477 --> 01:18:48,936
How much time until
we have to be at the hotel?

1485
01:18:49,021 --> 01:18:50,941
We've got 45 minutes.

1486
01:19:02,659 --> 01:19:07,246
- Karen. Karen.
- Jeff, your tie's stuck.

1487
01:19:07,331 --> 01:19:09,461
- Karen!
- Sorry, honey.

1488
01:19:15,589 --> 01:19:16,669
What?

1489
01:19:18,175 --> 01:19:19,305
I think they're having sex.

1490
01:19:21,428 --> 01:19:23,053
Goddamn it, we don't have time for this.

1491
01:19:23,138 --> 01:19:25,558
I mean, they're supposed to be
here in 45 minutes.

1492
01:19:28,352 --> 01:19:29,732
Nope, they are done.

1493
01:19:32,105 --> 01:19:33,105
All right.

1494
01:20:00,384 --> 01:20:03,802
Wow! Look, honey. Beautiful design!

1495
01:20:03,887 --> 01:20:05,427
- Hey, Karen.
- Yeah?

1496
01:20:06,098 --> 01:20:07,518
Thanks so much for the sex.

1497
01:20:14,731 --> 01:20:15,821
Go.

1498
01:20:16,316 --> 01:20:17,606
Hello!

1499
01:20:18,861 --> 01:20:21,153
- Hi.
- Hi. We have a reservation for two

1500
01:20:21,238 --> 01:20:23,614
under the name Rascal Flatts.

1501
01:20:23,699 --> 01:20:24,782
It's not our real name.

1502
01:20:24,867 --> 01:20:27,034
We're having an affair.

1503
01:20:27,119 --> 01:20:28,159
Come with me.

1504
01:20:31,540 --> 01:20:34,330
Hey, Tim. We're in the restaurant
right now. Everything's going okay.

1505
01:20:35,043 --> 01:20:36,085
Honey, sushi.

1506
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:39,130
There's sushi as well.
I'm gonna sign off for right now.

1507
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,130
Ciao.

1508
01:20:42,509 --> 01:20:44,589
- That's our table.
- No, this way.

1509
01:20:46,930 --> 01:20:48,010
Really?

1510
01:20:51,602 --> 01:20:53,062
Thank you so much.

1511
01:20:55,814 --> 01:20:57,523
Is this the line to the little boys' room?

1512
01:20:57,608 --> 01:20:59,478
- I don't need to use it.
- Come.

1513
01:21:01,945 --> 01:21:04,863
I'm confused. I...

1514
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:07,908
It's part of the...
I thought it was just gonna be us.

1515
01:21:07,993 --> 01:21:09,663
You fellas with The Scorpion?

1516
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:17,996
All right, they're on the move.

1517
01:21:19,004 --> 01:21:20,384
Moving into position.

1518
01:21:32,601 --> 01:21:33,771
Thank you.

1519
01:21:41,360 --> 01:21:43,235
There he is. Rascal Flatts.

1520
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:44,862
You have any trouble finding the place?

1521
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:47,656
No. Your henchmen were very...
I'm a little ticklish there.

1522
01:21:47,741 --> 01:21:49,032
Your henchmen were very helpful.

1523
01:21:49,117 --> 01:21:52,411
This must be the wife. Wow!
You guys really dressed up for tonight.

1524
01:21:52,496 --> 01:21:54,913
Thank you. Yeah.
Well, we don't get out very often.

1525
01:21:54,998 --> 01:21:57,124
When we do, we really
like to make the most of it.

1526
01:21:57,209 --> 01:21:59,460
Awesome. Ivan?

1527
01:21:59,545 --> 01:22:01,044
All clear.

1528
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:04,131
Sorry about the frisking. You cannot
be too careful in my line of work.

1529
01:22:04,216 --> 01:22:08,716
Let me make it up to you with some very
expensive, very delicious champagne.

1530
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:11,805
Wow! Look at that gun.

1531
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:16,310
And by the way, you two have
gotta try this dip. It's amazing.

1532
01:22:16,395 --> 01:22:18,896
It's a cheat day for me, so I went
a little crazy with room service.

1533
01:22:18,981 --> 01:22:20,230
I hope you don't mind.

1534
01:22:20,315 --> 01:22:22,816
Mrs. Flatts makes a great
seven-layer dip. I'll tell you that.

1535
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:24,151
I bet she does.

1536
01:22:24,236 --> 01:22:28,363
I do. The secret is an extra layer.
An eight-layer dip.

1537
01:22:28,448 --> 01:22:30,528
Sneaky! I love that.

1538
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:35,872
Do I know you from somewhere?

1539
01:22:37,332 --> 01:22:38,672
I seriously doubt it.

1540
01:22:39,626 --> 01:22:40,876
He's a people person.

1541
01:22:40,961 --> 01:22:44,463
Come on, Jeff. Stay calm.
Just do what we talked about.

1542
01:22:44,548 --> 01:22:48,218
Well, did the people person
bring this person his computer chips?

1543
01:22:48,886 --> 01:22:51,386
Yes. Yes, yes.
You'll find them right here.

1544
01:22:51,471 --> 01:22:52,891
Careful.

1545
01:23:09,156 --> 01:23:10,406
Denver, 2010.

1546
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:13,325
Were you at the National
Aerospace Convention?

1547
01:23:13,410 --> 01:23:15,790
Because I think we were
in the same focus group.

1548
01:23:16,788 --> 01:23:17,871
Are we still doing this?

1549
01:23:17,956 --> 01:23:20,249
No, we're n... it's done.
It's really done. It's so done.

1550
01:23:20,334 --> 01:23:21,917
Why does he keep asking those questions?

1551
01:23:22,002 --> 01:23:24,795
I don't think he can help it.
It's just what he does.

1552
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:27,381
He connects with people.

1553
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:29,550
- Perfect, as promised.
- Shit.

1554
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:30,975
Ivan?

1555
01:23:34,681 --> 01:23:37,433
Okay. Here we go. Thank you.

1556
01:23:37,518 --> 01:23:39,560
- Okay! We got it. Great.
- Yeah. That checks out.

1557
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:41,979
Well, pleasure doing business
with both of you.

1558
01:23:42,064 --> 01:23:44,106
Thank you, Mr. Scorpion and friends.

1559
01:23:44,191 --> 01:23:46,901
Thank you. Yeah. Okay. Grab that stuff.

1560
01:23:48,904 --> 01:23:50,821
Hey! You drop your little ball.

1561
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:52,573
That's fine. We have...
I have plenty of those.

1562
01:23:52,658 --> 01:23:54,533
Keep it. Keep it. It's a...

1563
01:23:54,618 --> 01:23:56,288
- Excuse me.
- Stop!

1564
01:24:03,961 --> 01:24:05,377
You're the HR guy.

1565
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:07,921
No, he's not. He's an engineer.
He... Dr. Flatts.

1566
01:24:08,006 --> 01:24:09,798
- Yeah, I'm in the rocket sciences.
- He went to college!

1567
01:24:09,883 --> 01:24:12,634
- He's very smart. MIT.
- No.

1568
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:14,511
No. You were right.

1569
01:24:14,596 --> 01:24:16,221
We have met before.

1570
01:24:16,306 --> 01:24:21,894
See from '02 to '05,
I was a mid-level drone at MBI.

1571
01:24:21,979 --> 01:24:25,189
- And you are Jeff Gaffney.
- No.

1572
01:24:25,274 --> 01:24:26,857
- Human Resources.
- Wrong.

1573
01:24:26,942 --> 01:24:30,068
Yeah. You helped me
with my "suicidal depression."

1574
01:24:30,153 --> 01:24:33,781
With your little trust exercises
and stress balls!

1575
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:35,532
This entire thing is a setup!

1576
01:24:35,617 --> 01:24:37,117
Goddamn it, Jeff!

1577
01:24:37,995 --> 01:24:40,370
Decoys have been made.
I repeat, decoys have been made.

1578
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:41,789
We need to extract. Do you copy?

1579
01:24:41,874 --> 01:24:44,583
Carlos, take a team out,
lock the hallway down.

1580
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:47,086
Yuri, take four guys up
the stairwell to the roof.

1581
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:49,671
Radio the helicopter, we are getting
the hell out of here.

1582
01:24:49,756 --> 01:24:52,633
We need backup to extract
the decoys. Do you copy?

1583
01:24:52,718 --> 01:24:54,843
Negative. Collateral damage.

1584
01:24:54,928 --> 01:24:57,846
We cannot engage in a public arena.
Pull back and abort.

1585
01:24:57,931 --> 01:24:59,221
Do you copy?

1586
01:25:00,642 --> 01:25:01,732
Jones, do you copy?

1587
01:25:02,519 --> 01:25:05,687
Boris, get some ice tongs
and a cigarette lighter.

1588
01:25:05,772 --> 01:25:08,482
Goddamn it, Jones. Do you copy?

1589
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:13,237
Copy, copy. Pulling out.
I repeat, pulling out.

1590
01:25:13,322 --> 01:25:15,162
We'll meet you at the extraction point.

1591
01:25:18,660 --> 01:25:20,869
You really wanna just leave them in there?

1592
01:25:20,954 --> 01:25:22,294
Of course not.

1593
01:25:23,457 --> 01:25:25,327
They're our neighbors.

1594
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:27,960
Sweetie, everything's fine, okay?

1595
01:25:28,045 --> 01:25:30,254
That's why I rent the extra henchmen,
for situations like this.

1596
01:25:30,339 --> 01:25:32,047
- Is it Peter? No.
- That's why I paid

1597
01:25:32,132 --> 01:25:33,715
- for the whole floor.
- Honey, what are you doing?

1598
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:35,717
- I'm trying to figure out his name.
- Chopper to the jet.

1599
01:25:35,802 --> 01:25:36,969
We'll be in Jakarta by morning,

1600
01:25:37,054 --> 01:25:38,354
- and when we get there, I...
- Bruce.

1601
01:25:40,390 --> 01:25:41,890
You talking to me?

1602
01:25:41,975 --> 01:25:44,515
I remember your name. Your name is Bruce.

1603
01:25:45,312 --> 01:25:46,478
Bruce Springstine.

1604
01:25:46,563 --> 01:25:49,731
I... No, I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

1605
01:25:49,816 --> 01:25:52,192
Nah, I'm the one that mediated
your parking space dispute.

1606
01:25:52,277 --> 01:25:55,279
Is that what caused you
to go into a life of crime?

1607
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:57,948
A bruised ego over a lousy parking space?

1608
01:25:58,033 --> 01:26:00,534
Jesus Christ! What is this? Amateur night?

1609
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:01,743
Wait a second.

1610
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:04,580
Your name is Bruce Springstine?

1611
01:26:04,665 --> 01:26:07,249
Yes, Ivan, it is. It's Bruce Springstine

1612
01:26:07,334 --> 01:26:09,334
and it's a perfectly good name
like any other name.

1613
01:26:09,419 --> 01:26:12,171
And you wanted us to call you The Boss?

1614
01:26:12,256 --> 01:26:14,757
I didn't want you guys
to call me "The Boss."

1615
01:26:14,842 --> 01:26:16,550
I wanted you to call me, "Boss."

1616
01:26:16,635 --> 01:26:20,012
All right? And that's just
for simplicity's sake. Okay?

1617
01:26:20,097 --> 01:26:21,138
That's just sad.

1618
01:26:21,223 --> 01:26:24,266
And that parking space thing
was bullshit, all right?

1619
01:26:24,351 --> 01:26:27,269
I'd been there for three years!
They still had me in Lot D!

1620
01:26:27,354 --> 01:26:30,022
That's the other side
of the highway, okay?

1621
01:26:30,107 --> 01:26:31,356
I had to cross the...

1622
01:26:31,441 --> 01:26:32,816
- The footbridge thing. Yeah!
- The little... The footbridge!

1623
01:26:32,901 --> 01:26:35,486
A footbridge, every day, rain or shine!

1624
01:26:35,571 --> 01:26:36,904
So, thank you.

1625
01:26:36,989 --> 01:26:38,614
- I am really going to enjoy this.
- Okay.

1626
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:40,079
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- No!

1627
01:26:41,034 --> 01:26:42,117
Good. SEAL team's here.

1628
01:26:42,202 --> 01:26:43,911
Go, go, go! Get down, get down, get down!

1629
01:26:43,996 --> 01:26:48,246
Go, boys! Go, go, go!
Shock and awe! Shock and awe!

1630
01:26:52,504 --> 01:26:54,797
Honey, I can't hear anything.

1631
01:26:54,882 --> 01:26:56,799
They're silent killers.
That's how they got Bin Laden.

1632
01:26:56,884 --> 01:26:58,974
- Let's just stay down, okay?
- Okay.

1633
01:27:07,769 --> 01:27:11,563
Where's the backup?
Those guys are with him.

1634
01:27:11,648 --> 01:27:13,190
There's no backup, Jeff.

1635
01:27:13,275 --> 01:27:14,983
They pulled out when you blew your cover.

1636
01:27:15,068 --> 01:27:17,986
What do you mean there's no backup?

1637
01:27:18,071 --> 01:27:20,656
You're what they call "collateral damage."

1638
01:27:20,741 --> 01:27:22,324
That's not good. I saw it on Homeland!

1639
01:27:22,409 --> 01:27:24,993
What do you me... You didn't say
anything about collateral damage!

1640
01:27:25,078 --> 01:27:26,995
I asked you about the worst-case
scenario and you said,

1641
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,081
"Well, the worst-case scenario,
I'll have backup."

1642
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:32,793
Well, this is worse! This is worse
than the worst-case scenario.

1643
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:34,211
You lied to our faces.

1644
01:27:34,296 --> 01:27:38,674
I did not lie to you. Now, I may
have left out a few key details...

1645
01:27:38,759 --> 01:27:40,050
That's a lie, Timothy!

1646
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:42,177
That is lying by omission.
That's textbook...

1647
01:27:42,262 --> 01:27:45,682
You know what? My whole job is lying.
Okay? That's why I fucking hate it!

1648
01:27:48,060 --> 01:27:50,144
- I'm sorry, Jeff.
- You're apologizing to him?

1649
01:27:50,229 --> 01:27:52,438
You can't possibly care about this loser.

1650
01:27:52,523 --> 01:27:55,403
You know what? I actually
do care about this loser.

1651
01:27:56,652 --> 01:27:58,902
I mean, you and I live
in a world where everybody lies.

1652
01:27:58,987 --> 01:28:01,864
And everybody hides everything
and obfuscates.

1653
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:04,199
But, not... Not Jeff Gaffney.

1654
01:28:05,369 --> 01:28:08,579
Jeff doesn't live in that world.
He's an honest person.

1655
01:28:08,664 --> 01:28:11,674
He's forthright, he's friendly.
He's a good neighbor.

1656
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:16,418
Do you have any idea how much
courage that takes? Real courage?

1657
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:19,219
For my money, he's the bravest guy
in this room.

1658
01:28:20,759 --> 01:28:22,968
- Please. Spare me the morality!
- Hey!

1659
01:28:23,053 --> 01:28:25,220
Just hear me out, all right?

1660
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:27,347
Look, the Gaffneys,
they don't belong in our world.

1661
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:29,308
We don't. We really don't.

1662
01:28:29,393 --> 01:28:31,810
Okay? They're too good for that.

1663
01:28:31,895 --> 01:28:34,146
Why don't we let them go
back to their world?

1664
01:28:34,231 --> 01:28:37,733
And then you and I, we,
can settle this here?

1665
01:28:37,818 --> 01:28:39,443
Here in our world.

1666
01:28:39,528 --> 01:28:42,446
You guys can go murder each other
and stuff. Just leave us out of this.

1667
01:28:42,531 --> 01:28:44,656
You know what? I'm just gonna take
care of everything myself. Bruno,

1668
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:46,992
lay the plastic sheeting out. I don't
wanna lose the security deposit.

1669
01:28:47,077 --> 01:28:49,787
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Can I finish a thought today?

1670
01:28:49,872 --> 01:28:52,498
I'm so sorry, Mr. Scorpion.

1671
01:28:52,583 --> 01:28:56,919
But, Natalie, ever since we tried
on underwear together...

1672
01:28:57,004 --> 01:28:58,754
I'm sorry. You talking to her?

1673
01:28:58,839 --> 01:29:00,214
Finish your thought.

1674
01:29:00,299 --> 01:29:02,469
I realized something.

1675
01:29:03,969 --> 01:29:05,349
I've been living a lie, also.

1676
01:29:09,850 --> 01:29:11,060
Karen!

1677
01:29:11,935 --> 01:29:12,975
What is happening to my life?

1678
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:28,367
Oh, my God! How long
have you been living that lie?

1679
01:29:28,452 --> 01:29:29,451
Honey! What? No!

1680
01:29:29,536 --> 01:29:31,745
I didn't mean it. I just had to
get the knife to her somehow!

1681
01:29:31,830 --> 01:29:36,170
Okay! I get it now. God! Thank God!
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

1682
01:29:49,765 --> 01:29:50,895
It's raining men!

1683
01:29:55,896 --> 01:29:56,937
You guys okay?

1684
01:29:57,022 --> 01:29:59,822
Grab the chips and follow us.
Come on, let's go.

1685
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:09,741
- Chopper's ready.
- Yeah, get 'em.

1686
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:10,866
And get the chips!

1687
01:30:13,163 --> 01:30:14,793
Get back, get back, get back!

1688
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:22,263
- I'm almost out.
- Me too.

1689
01:30:23,090 --> 01:30:24,340
What are we gonna do?

1690
01:30:26,885 --> 01:30:29,595
- We'll have to jump for it.
- Jump? Jump from where?

1691
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,804
Down there.

1692
01:30:30,889 --> 01:30:32,269
There's a pool down below.

1693
01:30:33,225 --> 01:30:34,808
It's our only chance.

1694
01:30:34,893 --> 01:30:36,310
Did you think any of this through?

1695
01:30:36,395 --> 01:30:37,735
Okay.

1696
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:41,357
Where are you going?

1697
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:47,947
Jeff? Jeff!

1698
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:50,574
Jeff. Jeff are you okay?

1699
01:30:50,659 --> 01:30:51,950
- I just farted.
- Buddy!

1700
01:30:52,035 --> 01:30:53,494
You can't jump through
the window like that.

1701
01:30:53,579 --> 01:30:55,746
That's triple pane glass!
You gotta break it first.

1702
01:30:55,831 --> 01:30:57,539
Appreciate the effort though.

1703
01:30:57,624 --> 01:30:59,134
Scoot back, everybody, all right?
Just scoot back.

1704
01:31:01,378 --> 01:31:02,628
Get out of the way.

1705
01:31:06,717 --> 01:31:07,757
Really?

1706
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:09,009
Stand back!

1707
01:31:09,094 --> 01:31:10,354
What?

1708
01:31:15,309 --> 01:31:16,391
Where'd you get that?

1709
01:31:16,476 --> 01:31:18,018
I picked it up off a dead guy.

1710
01:31:18,103 --> 01:31:19,144
- I thought he didn't need it.
- Run! Out of the window!

1711
01:31:19,229 --> 01:31:20,395
All right. Come on.
We're doing this. Let's go!

1712
01:31:20,480 --> 01:31:22,360
- Now! Now!
- Jump! Jump! Jump!

1713
01:31:30,115 --> 01:31:31,698
It's okay, everybody. It's okay.

1714
01:31:31,783 --> 01:31:32,908
Where's Jeff?

1715
01:31:32,993 --> 01:31:33,993
Guys, where's Jeff?

1716
01:31:38,248 --> 01:31:39,414
Jeff! Jeff, you've gotta...

1717
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:41,166
- Jeff, you've gotta jump!
- Jeff!

1718
01:31:41,251 --> 01:31:42,793
Give me a second.

1719
01:31:42,878 --> 01:31:44,838
- Jeff, jump! Please!
- Just run and jump!

1720
01:31:47,549 --> 01:31:49,629
This is perfect.

1721
01:31:50,385 --> 01:31:53,011
You've been a pain
in my ass all day, Jeff.

1722
01:31:53,096 --> 01:31:56,098
Okay, li... Bru... Mr. Scorpion,

1723
01:31:56,183 --> 01:31:58,225
we all make choices in life and I...

1724
01:31:58,310 --> 01:32:00,477
I'm not being judgmental, I promise you,

1725
01:32:00,562 --> 01:32:03,732
but do you really think that violence
is the solution? There's this exer...

1726
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:08,323
He's all yours, gravity.

1727
01:32:18,914 --> 01:32:20,504
And that's why you don't sting the...

1728
01:32:30,259 --> 01:32:31,679
Always have plan B.

1729
01:32:52,990 --> 01:32:54,907
I know it seemed a lot higher.

1730
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:56,241
Thank you very much.
That's for you. Keep it all.

1731
01:32:56,326 --> 01:32:57,868
Maybe you could videotape
that and put it online.

1732
01:32:57,953 --> 01:32:59,661
Where did you get the gun from?

1733
01:32:59,746 --> 01:33:01,663
No. I don't think we're
gonna keep any of that online.

1734
01:33:01,748 --> 01:33:02,915
That would get a lot of hits.

1735
01:33:03,000 --> 01:33:04,333
And I lined it up, and smashed.

1736
01:33:04,418 --> 01:33:05,918
Because there's shooting...

1737
01:33:06,003 --> 01:33:07,336
Probably wanna keep it
a little on the down low.

1738
01:33:07,421 --> 01:33:09,755
Yes. Of course.
Yeah, no, no, of course. Yes. Yes.

1739
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:10,923
I'm just saying.

1740
01:33:11,008 --> 01:33:12,591
I'm so proud of you guys.

1741
01:33:12,676 --> 01:33:14,551
- You guys wanna come inside?
- Yeah, come in.

1742
01:33:14,636 --> 01:33:15,716
Where are you guys staying?

1743
01:33:16,889 --> 01:33:18,597
- You could stay with us!
- Stay with us!

1744
01:33:18,682 --> 01:33:20,933
Why wouldn't you stay with us?
We have a pull-out couch.

1745
01:33:21,018 --> 01:33:23,977
You can borrow some of my boxer briefs
if you need anything to lounge in.

1746
01:33:24,062 --> 01:33:25,813
- I've got a Wii.
- We've got a flat screen TV!

1747
01:33:25,898 --> 01:33:27,439
We have free Wi-Fi.

1748
01:33:27,524 --> 01:33:30,192
- You guys are great! Really.
- It's very nice of you to offer.

1749
01:33:30,277 --> 01:33:31,360
But...

1750
01:33:31,445 --> 01:33:32,694
Our ride is coming.

1751
01:33:32,779 --> 01:33:35,781
Yeah. Yeah.
You got your things you have to do.

1752
01:33:35,866 --> 01:33:37,196
Your missions.

1753
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:46,500
Is that an Uber?

1754
01:33:46,585 --> 01:33:47,885
Sort of.

1755
01:33:50,130 --> 01:33:51,171
Hug?

1756
01:33:51,256 --> 01:33:53,336
- Just a hug?
- Just a hug.

1757
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:56,763
Thank you. You're an amazing woman.

1758
01:33:57,763 --> 01:33:58,973
Thank you.

1759
01:34:01,016 --> 01:34:02,926
You made an incredible life
for yourself here, Jeff.

1760
01:34:03,852 --> 01:34:06,312
Just remember to leave the cul-de-sac,
every now and again.

1761
01:34:06,939 --> 01:34:09,319
You'd be surprised
at what you find out there.

1762
01:34:11,652 --> 01:34:12,692
We'll remember.

1763
01:34:13,654 --> 01:34:15,324
- Time to go.
- Yes.

1764
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:21,450
Where's the driver?

1765
01:34:22,454 --> 01:34:23,874
Right here.

1766
01:34:24,581 --> 01:34:26,457
There's no driver in the car.

1767
01:34:26,542 --> 01:34:28,250
If they're shooting at us, I get to drive.

1768
01:34:28,335 --> 01:34:29,918
Now you wanna drive.

1769
01:34:30,003 --> 01:34:31,133
I see how it works.

1770
01:34:32,506 --> 01:34:33,876
You get to drive the good car.

1771
01:34:35,300 --> 01:34:36,680
Bye, you guys!

1772
01:34:45,185 --> 01:34:46,225
Okay.

1773
01:34:48,981 --> 01:34:52,441
You know, it's Parents Day
at the camp tomorrow.

1774
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:25,684
This is going straight to Facebook.
Keep sucking!

1775
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:28,270
- That's good.
- What does it taste like?

1776
01:35:28,896 --> 01:35:30,771
It tastes like Mikey's sock.

1777
01:35:30,856 --> 01:35:32,648
But I mean that in a good way.
Here, try it.

1778
01:35:32,733 --> 01:35:35,109
I miss Mikey's little feet and his socks.

1779
01:35:35,194 --> 01:35:36,534
Yeah. Here.

1780
01:35:38,405 --> 01:35:39,525
Okay, ready?

1781
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:42,530
Oh, God! That really hurt.

1782
01:35:44,286 --> 01:35:45,496
What?

1783
01:35:46,872 --> 01:35:48,288
Oh, my God!

1784
01:35:48,373 --> 01:35:50,457
- Guys!
- Natalie! Tim!

1785
01:35:50,542 --> 01:35:52,212
You've gotta be kidding me!

1786
01:35:52,836 --> 01:35:53,836
What?

1787
01:35:53,921 --> 01:35:55,963
- Can I take this?
- Are you kidding me?

1788
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:57,589
We are here because of you.

1789
01:35:57,674 --> 01:35:58,799
You told us about this place

1790
01:35:58,884 --> 01:36:00,259
and that's why we came!

1791
01:36:00,344 --> 01:36:02,136
You are here. In Marrakesh.

1792
01:36:02,221 --> 01:36:03,762
- That's a good memory. Wow.
- Amazing!

1793
01:36:03,847 --> 01:36:04,972
- What?
- That's amazing.

1794
01:36:05,057 --> 01:36:06,682
- My God.
- You have a baby!

1795
01:36:06,767 --> 01:36:08,976
- Yes, he just fell asleep.
- He just fell asleep.

1796
01:36:09,061 --> 01:36:11,186
You had a baby? You old dogs!

1797
01:36:11,271 --> 01:36:13,647
Does that mean you guys left the agency?

1798
01:36:13,732 --> 01:36:15,441
- Well, yeah. It's a very...
- Well...

1799
01:36:15,526 --> 01:36:16,775
- Yeah?
- Long story.

1800
01:36:16,860 --> 01:36:19,069
But we can't really get into it right now.

1801
01:36:19,154 --> 01:36:22,239
But, it's good to see you!

1802
01:36:22,324 --> 01:36:24,533
Jeff, do me a big favor? Will you just...

1803
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:26,243
- scoot a little bit to your right?
- Yeah. Sure thing.

1804
01:36:26,328 --> 01:36:27,327
Thank you!

1805
01:36:27,412 --> 01:36:29,329
I am blown away, you guys. This is un...

1806
01:36:29,414 --> 01:36:31,832
Jeff, I don't want you
to turn around right now,

1807
01:36:31,917 --> 01:36:35,335
but there are four guys in fezzes
behind you on the...

1808
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:36,420
Jeff, I just said don't turn around.

1809
01:36:36,505 --> 01:36:38,380
Jeff, I just specifically
asked you not to turn around.

1810
01:36:38,465 --> 01:36:40,174
I know but you said there are four
guys in fezzes behind me.

1811
01:36:40,259 --> 01:36:41,467
We're in Morocco. There's a lot of fezzes.

1812
01:36:41,552 --> 01:36:43,010
But it's human nature,
I think, to turn around

1813
01:36:43,095 --> 01:36:44,678
to something like that. Don't you think?

1814
01:36:44,763 --> 01:36:46,221
Honey. We blew their cover again.

1815
01:36:46,306 --> 01:36:48,307
- No! No.
- What?

1816
01:36:48,392 --> 01:36:49,975
- We should feed the baby?
- I think we should feed the baby.

1817
01:36:50,060 --> 01:36:51,518
- If you can just pass me the bottle...
- We blew their cover?

1818
01:36:51,603 --> 01:36:52,895
- ...that would be great.
- Darn it.

1819
01:36:52,980 --> 01:36:55,147
- Can you hold this bag for me?
- Do you mind holding the baby?

1820
01:36:55,232 --> 01:36:57,983
Before you freak out, it's just a baby.

1821
01:36:58,068 --> 01:36:59,985
- All right? Don't worry.
- Kids are great! I have pictures.

1822
01:37:00,070 --> 01:37:01,069
- Karen, how do you get...
- I'll tell you what.

1823
01:37:01,154 --> 01:37:02,738
Just put it in here and show me.

1824
01:37:02,823 --> 01:37:04,198
Kind of see what I'm dealing with.

1825
01:37:04,283 --> 01:37:05,699
Okay. I see now.

1826
01:37:05,784 --> 01:37:07,493
Okay? See what that is?

1827
01:37:07,578 --> 01:37:09,411
- It's okay, honey.
- I need you to breathe.

1828
01:37:09,496 --> 01:37:11,038
- You can do it.
- You've done this before.

1829
01:37:11,123 --> 01:37:14,541
On three, I want you to get down,
and take cover. Okay?

1830
01:37:14,626 --> 01:37:15,626
One...

1831
01:37:15,711 --> 01:37:16,919
Two...

1832
01:37:17,004 --> 01:37:19,054
Jesus, Jeff! Everybody down, right now.

1833
01:37:24,303 --> 01:37:26,763
- I miss those guys.
- Me too.
