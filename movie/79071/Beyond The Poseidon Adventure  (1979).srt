00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:12,042
- I hope those lines hold.
- Hold on. Hold on, Wilbur.

2
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:22,444
Hold on to the wheel.

3
00:02:38,613 --> 00:02:40,604
I'm sick.

4
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:58,244
- Shut that window, Wilbur.
- All right, I'm trying.

5
00:02:58,693 --> 00:03:00,763
I'll help you, Wilbur.

6
00:03:01,293 --> 00:03:03,249
Mike, look out.

7
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:06,088
Bloody hell.
Get her below, or I'll kill her.

8
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,527
- Hey, I was...
- I'm telling you!

9
00:03:07,693 --> 00:03:09,365
Get her... Get her out of here!

10
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,683
- Get below!
- I'm going.

11
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:14,731
I don't understand you.
I'm going down now.

12
00:03:15,693 --> 00:03:17,206
Get below.

13
00:03:38,373 --> 00:03:40,807
Oh, God, not that.

14
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:52,251
What a hell of a way
to spend New Year's Eve.

15
00:04:07,533 --> 00:04:09,205
How did you even
find someone like that?

16
00:04:09,373 --> 00:04:12,331
Mike, I told you,
I didn't find her, she found me.

17
00:04:12,493 --> 00:04:14,404
She saved my ass
the other night in a bar.

18
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:16,803
Two guys were trying to roll me,
and she comes up...

19
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,929
...and hits one over the head
with a bottle...

20
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:22,130
...and the other one, she just kicked
in that spot where it hurts most.

21
00:04:22,293 --> 00:04:24,443
You should've seen her.
You should've been there.

22
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:27,173
It's okay, it's okay.
I caught her act last night.

23
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,403
Well, it could've been worse.

24
00:04:29,573 --> 00:04:32,690
Remember that spider monkey
I brought aboard last year?

25
00:04:32,853 --> 00:04:34,081
Sorry.

26
00:04:34,253 --> 00:04:37,131
The only difference so far
is the real monkey didn't apologize.

27
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:41,765
Morning.

28
00:04:42,253 --> 00:04:44,130
- Here.
- Good morning.

29
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:45,885
Good morning.

30
00:04:46,613 --> 00:04:49,366
Hey, look, I'm really sorry
about last night.

31
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,524
Usually I'm totally terrific on boats.

32
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:57,772
- What's this supposed to be?
- Coffee.

33
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:00,725
Try again.

34
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:05,288
Listen, ace, it's not exactly
the Waldorf down there.

35
00:05:05,453 --> 00:05:07,808
Mine's okay, Mike.
At least it's hot.

36
00:05:07,973 --> 00:05:09,122
Try again.

37
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:12,567
If I'd known I was gonna be
sailing with Captain Bligh...

38
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:15,247
...I'd have stayed put
up in my chateau in the Riviera.

39
00:05:15,413 --> 00:05:18,405
Chateau? Is that what
the other girls called it?

40
00:05:18,573 --> 00:05:21,212
Hey, wait a minute.
Now, that's untrue and totally unfair.

41
00:05:21,373 --> 00:05:23,170
- And absolutely, totally...
- I'm sorry, hon.

42
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,607
I really am sorry.

43
00:05:24,773 --> 00:05:27,207
Yeah. I can see you are.

44
00:05:27,373 --> 00:05:28,886
That's okay.

45
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:35,964
She's a good kid, Mike.
Really, she is.

46
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,646
She's just trying to get to Africa.

47
00:05:37,813 --> 00:05:39,644
I know, I know.

48
00:05:39,813 --> 00:05:44,170
But it'd be so much nicer if somehow
all of this was someone's fault.

49
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:47,769
Come on now. When we get back
to Marseille, you're going to the bank.

50
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:50,606
You'll extend the mortgage on the boat,
that's what you'll do.

51
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:54,083
Mike, losing your cargo in a storm
like that, the bank will understand.

52
00:05:54,253 --> 00:05:55,971
Oh, sure.

53
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,324
In times of real trouble...

54
00:05:58,493 --> 00:06:01,053
...one thing a man can depend on
is the sympathy of a bank.

55
00:06:01,213 --> 00:06:02,362
Come on, now.

56
00:06:03,693 --> 00:06:05,524
Hey, take a look up there.

57
00:06:06,013 --> 00:06:07,685
Chopper, right?

58
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:10,970
French coast guard.

59
00:06:17,773 --> 00:06:21,561
For them to be out this far,
some ship must be in big trouble.

60
00:06:27,173 --> 00:06:29,084
What am I thinking, Wilbur?

61
00:06:29,253 --> 00:06:31,369
- Tell me.
- Salvage.

62
00:06:31,533 --> 00:06:34,047
- You're thinking salvage.
- Salvage, hell.

63
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,885
Salvation.

64
00:06:36,053 --> 00:06:38,886
Some poor devil is stranded out there.

65
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:42,728
Get a fix on that chopper's course and
we'll follow it back where it came from.

66
00:06:42,893 --> 00:06:46,203
I knew it.
I knew my luck couldn't be that bad.

67
00:06:47,013 --> 00:06:49,766
Nothing was gonna get worse,
because nothing could've.

68
00:06:50,893 --> 00:06:53,726
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

69
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:59,646
Look what I found.

70
00:06:59,813 --> 00:07:01,610
- Happy New Year.
- I'll drink to that.

71
00:07:46,253 --> 00:07:47,242
Oh, my gosh.

72
00:07:48,573 --> 00:07:51,167
- All those people.
- Yeah, it's a lousy business...

73
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,370
...when someone's gotta die
before you can make a buck.

74
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:56,012
But, you know...

75
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:59,245
...all that salvage is gonna belong
to somebody. Why not us?

76
00:07:59,413 --> 00:08:02,564
I hate to be this big party pooper,
but aren't we slightly overmatched?

77
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:06,521
This thing's gonna get a double hernia
trying to haul that thing back into shore.

78
00:08:06,693 --> 00:08:07,728
We don't have to.

79
00:08:07,893 --> 00:08:10,532
Not if the French coast guard
found a way in.

80
00:08:13,653 --> 00:08:16,008
You're looking at
a four-star passenger liner...

81
00:08:16,773 --> 00:08:20,209
...carrying hundreds of wealthy people
on a European cruise.

82
00:08:20,853 --> 00:08:24,528
The only kind of salvage I want out of
there is the kind I can carry on my back.

83
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:27,605
And end up with what?
A bagful of credit cards and gold fillings?

84
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:28,842
Charming.

85
00:08:29,013 --> 00:08:31,527
A quick trip down
to the purser's office.

86
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:34,413
That's where the money
and the jewels are.

87
00:08:34,573 --> 00:08:36,609
Maybe even some gold.

88
00:08:36,973 --> 00:08:38,611
In and out and I'll be on my way back.

89
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:47,531
That was an explosion inside the hull.

90
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,570
Maybe it's trying to tell you something.

91
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,769
- Mike.
- I gotta get in there before it goes down.

92
00:08:51,933 --> 00:08:54,367
I don't know, she could go down
any moment now.

93
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:56,683
The <i>Andrea Doria</i> stayed up
for more than 10 hours.

94
00:08:56,853 --> 00:08:59,162
Well, I stayed up for a week once.
So what?

95
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,289
We're wasting time.

96
00:09:01,813 --> 00:09:05,965
Now, listen,
I'm going in there by myself.

97
00:09:06,133 --> 00:09:08,408
They're about to take my ship
away from me...

98
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:11,690
...but I've got this chance,
and I'm sure as hell gonna take it.

99
00:09:12,613 --> 00:09:14,729
There could be a fortune in there.

100
00:09:15,173 --> 00:09:16,526
And if there is, it's mine.

101
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,452
Wilbur...

102
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:21,524
...make ready the skiff.

103
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,331
- Get the monkey to help you.
- Monkey?

104
00:09:23,493 --> 00:09:25,324
I didn't know you guys had
a monkey aboard.

105
00:09:25,493 --> 00:09:27,131
Gee, I didn't see one...

106
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:30,247
Wonderful.

107
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:37,923
<i>- Ahoy,</i> Jenny<i>, ahoy.</i>
- We've got company.

108
00:10:02,253 --> 00:10:05,882
I'm Dr. Stefan Svevo, and this is
the medical rescue ship <i>Irene</i>.

109
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,333
That must be the <i>Poseidon</i>.
We heard her S.O.S. Last night.

110
00:10:09,493 --> 00:10:14,123
Sheer off. I have the salvage rights here.
Captain Michael Turner.

111
00:10:14,293 --> 00:10:18,764
A capsized ship is like a giant air bubble,
captain, and there may be survivors.

112
00:10:18,933 --> 00:10:21,606
My paramedics and I could be
instrumental in guiding them off.

113
00:10:21,773 --> 00:10:25,891
- Give them medical attention, if needed.
- The survivors have been taken out.

114
00:10:26,053 --> 00:10:28,362
But you can look
and take out any you find.

115
00:10:28,533 --> 00:10:30,091
But only survivors.

116
00:10:30,253 --> 00:10:33,928
I will take out anything else that I find.
Is that understood?

117
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,766
Well, that was my original
proposition to you, captain.

118
00:10:36,933 --> 00:10:38,127
Good.

119
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:41,763
Then we'll start getting our gear
together, and I suggest you do the same.

120
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,924
Well, we are prepared
to go aboard right now...

121
00:10:44,093 --> 00:10:45,924
...but, don't worry, captain, we'll wait.

122
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:11,685
Sorry, not a chance.

123
00:11:11,853 --> 00:11:13,411
Way I see it,
you don't have a choice.

124
00:11:13,573 --> 00:11:14,562
How's that?

125
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:18,408
As I said, I'm in a desperate need
to get to North Africa.

126
00:11:18,573 --> 00:11:21,804
You leave me here and sail off without
me, that's exactly what I'm gonna do.

127
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,487
Wilbur, we're gonna tie her up
and throw her in the tug.

128
00:11:24,653 --> 00:11:26,405
If you don't come back, I'll die up here.

129
00:11:26,573 --> 00:11:29,133
- That is a definite possibility.
- Oh, come off it, Turner.

130
00:11:29,293 --> 00:11:31,887
I know you're a tough guy,
but you're not a son of a bitch...

131
00:11:32,053 --> 00:11:35,841
...no matter how bad you want me
to think you are, are you?

132
00:11:36,013 --> 00:11:37,128
Sit down.

133
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:42,004
- Ready?
- Yeah.

134
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:28,690
I hope you're a religious man, captain.

135
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,847
I've taken the liberty of saying
a small prayer for us.

136
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:33,002
All of us?

137
00:12:33,173 --> 00:12:36,643
Well, it's my feeling that
from this time on...

138
00:12:36,813 --> 00:12:39,646
...our fates are necessarily intertwined.

139
00:12:39,813 --> 00:12:41,485
Good, then you won't be offended...

140
00:12:41,653 --> 00:12:45,123
...if I remind you
of that fact from time to time.

141
00:12:48,933 --> 00:12:52,164
The French coast guard
must have cut a hole in the ship.

142
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,211
Skipper, I'm telling you,
it's a floating time bomb.

143
00:13:51,373 --> 00:13:54,126
Hazards of the trade. Let's go.

144
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,126
Hold it.

145
00:14:24,013 --> 00:14:26,049
We've gotta find a way down.

146
00:14:29,293 --> 00:14:30,806
Like over there, maybe.

147
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:33,168
- Where?
- There.

148
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,971
Take a look, Wilbur.

149
00:14:55,133 --> 00:14:56,771
This will do.

150
00:14:59,093 --> 00:15:01,926
Yeah, this'll do it. Come on.

151
00:15:16,133 --> 00:15:17,805
Here, this way.

152
00:15:58,013 --> 00:16:01,892
It's the escape hatch
for the engine-room crew.

153
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:09,531
Coming, monkey?

154
00:16:10,453 --> 00:16:12,091
Why not?

155
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,489
Where are we?

156
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:42,250
- Looks like a mess.
- It's the gym.

157
00:17:57,773 --> 00:17:58,922
Just hold on and help him.

158
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:02,170
- What happened?
- The ventilators collapsed.

159
00:18:14,573 --> 00:18:16,723
- You got him?
- I got him.

160
00:18:16,933 --> 00:18:18,446
Come on.

161
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:39,052
Come on, you can make it.

162
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:02,172
- How is he?
- He'll be all right.

163
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:14,366
- Is everyone else all right?
- I'm fine.

164
00:19:16,093 --> 00:19:18,732
Okay, we're locked in.
No way of getting out there now.

165
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:21,612
Sure there is. There must be
another entrance into that engine...

166
00:19:25,733 --> 00:19:28,486
What's so funny, doctor?
Let us in on it.

167
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:31,208
I'm sure we could all use
a good laugh right about now.

168
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:33,523
I find it ironic, that's all, captain...

169
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:37,083
...that I've suddenly become one of the
very people I came down here to rescue.

170
00:19:38,293 --> 00:19:42,366
Doctor, that little prayer you said
for all of us up there...

171
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,206
...what sort of religion
would that happen to be?

172
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:47,042
Greek Orthodox.

173
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,005
Greek Orthodox. No kidding?

174
00:19:49,173 --> 00:19:50,891
I'm a Greek Orthodox too...

175
00:19:51,053 --> 00:19:52,202
...suddenly.

176
00:20:13,773 --> 00:20:15,923
Wilbur, switch the steam off.

177
00:20:21,373 --> 00:20:22,726
Over here.

178
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:36,208
- Are you the rescue team?
- We used to be.

179
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:39,285
Last night was the worst
New Year's party I've ever been to.

180
00:20:39,453 --> 00:20:41,489
I mean, everything turns upside down.

181
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,130
What a party. What a night.

182
00:20:44,293 --> 00:20:46,249
Look, I lost my daughter.

183
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:49,849
- You gotta help me find my daughter.
- Calm down, mister. Just calm down.

184
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:51,651
I'm Captain Mike Turner...

185
00:20:51,813 --> 00:20:54,691
...and I have the salvage rights
to this wreck.

186
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,927
Now, who are you people?

187
00:20:58,093 --> 00:21:00,971
I'm Gina Rowe, the ship's nurse.

188
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:06,287
It all happened so quickly.
We never knew what happened.

189
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:08,444
- Any other survivors?
- There couldn't be.

190
00:21:08,613 --> 00:21:10,888
We can't be sure of that, Suzanne.

191
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:14,363
Mr. Mazzetti,
Suzanne and myself...

192
00:21:14,533 --> 00:21:16,808
...we were following
some other passengers...

193
00:21:16,973 --> 00:21:18,850
...and we got separated from them...

194
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:22,403
...and we stumbled
into the steam room.

195
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,643
It looked like a safe place, at the time.

196
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:27,725
- It was until that pipe broke.
- Look, forget the pipe.

197
00:21:27,893 --> 00:21:30,327
Help me find my daughter,
I'll give you everything I got.

198
00:21:30,493 --> 00:21:31,562
Understand? Everything.

199
00:21:31,733 --> 00:21:34,805
Let's just get it out of here, okay?
Which way, captain?

200
00:21:34,973 --> 00:21:37,203
We were hoping
you'd give us the answer.

201
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:40,968
Oh, my God.

202
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:46,564
The rest of your crew, they're
on their way down here right now?

203
00:21:47,293 --> 00:21:48,806
No.

204
00:21:48,973 --> 00:21:51,043
Those two over there are my crew.

205
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:52,612
All of it.

206
00:21:53,173 --> 00:21:55,403
- Just the three of you?
- That's right.

207
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:57,928
What, did you come by canoe?

208
00:21:59,053 --> 00:22:01,692
You, what are you doing down here?

209
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:03,684
I'm Dr. Stefan Svevo, Mr. Mazzetti...

210
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:05,923
...and I've been asking myself
that same question.

211
00:22:06,093 --> 00:22:07,651
Oh, my God.

212
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:09,644
My daughter, she hated this trip.

213
00:22:09,813 --> 00:22:11,804
She wanted to stay home
for Christmas.

214
00:22:11,973 --> 00:22:15,602
I said, "Honey, I want you to see
where I fought the war in Italy. Anzio."

215
00:22:15,773 --> 00:22:18,412
Anzio? I've been to Anzio.

216
00:22:18,573 --> 00:22:19,688
Anzio's the pits.

217
00:22:19,853 --> 00:22:22,162
- You sound just like my daughter.
- Easy, Mazzetti.

218
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:25,284
How well do you know this ship, Gina?

219
00:22:25,453 --> 00:22:28,809
Hardly at all. It's my first voyage.

220
00:22:29,653 --> 00:22:32,804
Well, there must be a deck plan
around here somewhere.

221
00:22:33,293 --> 00:22:35,045
There's always one in every section.

222
00:22:35,213 --> 00:22:37,124
Look, I used the gym a couple of times.

223
00:22:37,293 --> 00:22:39,807
Seems like there's a deck plan
in the lobby over there.

224
00:22:39,973 --> 00:22:41,042
The ladies stay here.

225
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:44,011
The rest of you,
help me find a deck plan.

226
00:22:44,573 --> 00:22:46,404
Through here.

227
00:22:50,053 --> 00:22:53,443
- I guess I was wrong.
- There it is.

228
00:22:58,253 --> 00:22:59,368
We're here.

229
00:22:59,533 --> 00:23:01,649
Here it is. Here it is.

230
00:23:02,453 --> 00:23:03,647
We found it.

231
00:23:03,813 --> 00:23:06,088
- You found a way out?
- No.

232
00:23:06,253 --> 00:23:08,528
But we found the purser's office.

233
00:23:09,413 --> 00:23:11,768
You're a very single-minded man,
captain.

234
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:14,891
- And some would say callously so.
- Watch out.

235
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:21,285
The way I see it, doctor,
is that we're all trapped here anyway...

236
00:23:21,453 --> 00:23:24,650
...so I see no reason not to try
and get what I originally came for.

237
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,087
Here.

238
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:29,929
Look, forget the purser's office.
I gotta find my kid.

239
00:23:30,773 --> 00:23:32,172
Mazzetti!

240
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,604
- Look, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- Neither did I.

241
00:23:44,773 --> 00:23:46,206
Okay, so I was stupid.

242
00:23:46,373 --> 00:23:49,126
But somebody's gotta do something.
We just can't sit around.

243
00:23:49,293 --> 00:23:52,012
Look, she's alive, I know it.
I can feel it.

244
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:55,210
Fine. Then you tell us where she is,
and we'll all go look for her.

245
00:23:57,773 --> 00:24:00,333
- I don't know.
- Then shut up and calm down.

246
00:24:00,493 --> 00:24:03,212
We have as good a chance
of finding your daughter or way out...

247
00:24:03,373 --> 00:24:05,489
...by heading for the purser's office
as anywhere.

248
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:09,123
And that is through there.
Now let's go.

249
00:24:12,373 --> 00:24:15,171
After you, skipper. Come on.

250
00:24:15,693 --> 00:24:18,526
Keep on moving, that's my philosophy.

251
00:24:21,813 --> 00:24:24,168
I really don't see
that there's any alternative.

252
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:26,644
We're putting our faith in you, captain.

253
00:24:26,813 --> 00:24:28,485
What, you're putting your faith in him?

254
00:24:28,653 --> 00:24:31,042
An hour ago, he's sunbathing
up there on the poop deck.

255
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:33,010
Now he's down
in this underwater coffin...

256
00:24:33,173 --> 00:24:35,687
...trapped with the rest of us,
that's how smart he is.

257
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,086
You.

258
00:24:38,253 --> 00:24:41,325
You haven't come forward yet.
You look like a reasonable man.

259
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,685
What do you say we throw in together?

260
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:46,128
We'll find my daughter
and get the hell out of here.

261
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:48,488
May I see the deck plan, please?

262
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:57,731
Well, I'm afraid my knowledge
of ships and underwater conditions...

263
00:24:57,893 --> 00:24:59,884
...falls far short of Captain Turner's.

264
00:25:00,173 --> 00:25:04,166
But I am flattered, Mr. Mazzetti,
that you'd feel safer being with me.

265
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:08,611
But at the moment, at least, I'd feel
much safer being with the captain.

266
00:25:08,853 --> 00:25:12,129
And, captain, I'm at your service.

267
00:25:14,253 --> 00:25:17,689
Well, I don't seem
to have a choice anymore, do I?

268
00:25:23,973 --> 00:25:26,885
By the way, Mazzetti,
what rank were you in the war?

269
00:25:27,053 --> 00:25:30,045
If it's any of your business,
master sergeant.

270
00:25:30,213 --> 00:25:33,762
Good. Then you'll be used
to taking orders from captains.

271
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:36,686
Move it out, sarge.

272
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:33,006
Here it is, the purser's office.

273
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,012
Wilbur.

274
00:26:43,693 --> 00:26:45,126
Take this...

275
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:47,488
...and hold those wires back.

276
00:26:48,693 --> 00:26:51,332
Do you ladies think
you could jump this?

277
00:26:55,613 --> 00:26:59,492
Well, it can't be more
than 6 or 7 feet across.

278
00:26:59,693 --> 00:27:01,923
When I was the captain
of my college track team...

279
00:27:02,093 --> 00:27:05,608
...often times, you know,
we'd dig this pit...

280
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:11,203
- Well, it can't be much of a jump, can it?
- Speak for yourself.

281
00:27:12,133 --> 00:27:16,445
When I was in the Girl Scouts, I once
won a medal for the running broad jump.

282
00:27:16,613 --> 00:27:20,162
How many tries they give you?
Best of three?

283
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,087
Show them how it's done, Gina.

284
00:27:30,813 --> 00:27:31,802
Take a run at it.

285
00:27:33,053 --> 00:27:34,406
Look, if you miss, Gina...

286
00:27:34,573 --> 00:27:36,643
Mr. Mazzetti, would you
hold that for me, please?

287
00:27:36,813 --> 00:27:39,202
Please, call me Frankie.

288
00:27:43,093 --> 00:27:44,651
Take a run.

289
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,527
All right, Gina.

290
00:27:50,893 --> 00:27:53,282
Come on, sarge, join us.

291
00:27:53,573 --> 00:27:56,041
Don't worry about me, Turner.

292
00:28:03,413 --> 00:28:06,086
- My dress. I don't think I can make it.
- Take it off.

293
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,285
- I beg your pardon?
- Take it off.

294
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:11,525
He's got a real way with words,
doesn't he?

295
00:28:11,893 --> 00:28:15,090
- With apologies, madame. Givenchy?
- It's a copy, actually.

296
00:28:17,813 --> 00:28:20,281
Should we be fortunate enough
to get out of here alive...

297
00:28:20,453 --> 00:28:23,047
...I'd be very happy to replace it
with the real thing.

298
00:28:29,293 --> 00:28:32,126
- Oh, God, hold me, please.
- Oh, brother.

299
00:28:32,733 --> 00:28:34,291
I'm okay.

300
00:28:35,573 --> 00:28:38,007
- Are you gonna be all right?
- As soon as you make it. Go.

301
00:28:38,173 --> 00:28:39,970
Well, I can't, Wilbur, I can't.

302
00:28:40,133 --> 00:28:42,567
I can't make this jump
unless you're on the other side...

303
00:28:42,733 --> 00:28:44,724
Shut up, the pair of you,
and one of you jump.

304
00:28:44,893 --> 00:28:47,532
- Right. Wilbur.
- Hold the wires back for him.

305
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:07,042
Come on.

306
00:29:15,053 --> 00:29:17,692
Just a minute. Take a run.

307
00:29:17,853 --> 00:29:19,730
- Okay.
- Okay.

308
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:25,011
- I have the shortest legs of any of us.
- Shut up and come now!

309
00:29:25,173 --> 00:29:27,164
- Okay, here I come. Are you ready?
- Yes.

310
00:29:27,333 --> 00:29:28,766
Okay.

311
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:39,044
That's a hell of a track team
you belonged to.

312
00:29:39,213 --> 00:29:40,851
Actually, my specialty was the discus.

313
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,890
- Get out of here.
- I was good at the discus.

314
00:29:48,173 --> 00:29:49,891
The safe, do you see?

315
00:29:55,653 --> 00:29:58,042
- Coming, doctor?
- Well, I've been thinking, captain.

316
00:29:58,973 --> 00:30:00,611
We'll separate into two camps.

317
00:30:00,773 --> 00:30:02,252
We'll go aft...

318
00:30:02,413 --> 00:30:04,165
...and you and your party
continue forward.

319
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,766
Is that an order?

320
00:30:05,933 --> 00:30:08,652
Hopefully it's a constructive suggestion.

321
00:30:10,053 --> 00:30:14,251
All right, doctor,
we'll play it your way.

322
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:25,132
Hey, look, we're wasting time.

323
00:30:25,293 --> 00:30:27,329
This ship could blow up
or go down any second.

324
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:28,608
We gotta find my daughter.

325
00:30:28,773 --> 00:30:30,365
- She could be anywhere.
- Mike.

326
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,569
Look, she's not here.
Let's look somewhere else.

327
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:34,564
- Think we need the plastique?
- I don't know.

328
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:37,488
- Did you ever live with a safe cracker?
- Absolutely.

329
00:30:37,653 --> 00:30:39,245
Of course, I didn't know at the time.

330
00:30:39,413 --> 00:30:41,210
She's not in the safe,
I can tell you that.

331
00:30:51,853 --> 00:30:54,083
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

332
00:30:54,253 --> 00:30:57,404
That's okay, Mike, don't worry
about me. I'm just fine too.

333
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,928
Well, what do you know.

334
00:31:14,093 --> 00:31:16,891
Now, that's one way to crack a safe.

335
00:31:20,973 --> 00:31:25,251
- Where do you think you're going?
- Let's not wait around for the cops.

336
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:05,293
- 1796.
- How much you think they're worth?

337
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:07,728
A hundred times its weight in gold.

338
00:32:09,893 --> 00:32:10,882
Bort.

339
00:32:11,053 --> 00:32:12,771
- What?
- Bort.

340
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,491
- What's that?
- Industrial diamonds.

341
00:32:14,653 --> 00:32:15,688
How much are they worth?

342
00:32:15,853 --> 00:32:18,731
Oh, I'd say 3 to 400,000 dollars' worth.

343
00:32:21,093 --> 00:32:23,846
Now, wait a minute.
Tell me the truth, is this really ours?

344
00:32:24,013 --> 00:32:25,571
Yeah, the law of salvage.

345
00:32:25,733 --> 00:32:28,167
Pack up and let's get out of here.

346
00:32:28,333 --> 00:32:32,326
Can you see us now, Mike? Can you
see us along the Riviera now, huh?

347
00:32:32,493 --> 00:32:33,642
Why, we're rich.

348
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:37,886
You know what? We don't need
a bank anymore, do we, huh?

349
00:32:38,053 --> 00:32:41,443
No bank for us anymore.
We're filthy, stinking...

350
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:43,524
Great, great. So you're all rich.

351
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,327
Puke, son.

352
00:32:49,493 --> 00:32:54,806
That's fine Saint-Emilion, 19 and 61.

353
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:01,769
Whole ship's rocking pretty bad,
ain't it, captain?

354
00:33:03,893 --> 00:33:05,770
How you doing, Tex?

355
00:33:05,933 --> 00:33:11,963
Well, I gotta confess,
I've had smoother crossings in my day.

356
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:17,923
Name's Dewey Hopkins.
I'm from Big D, Texas.

357
00:33:18,893 --> 00:33:21,088
That's Dallas, folks.

358
00:33:22,173 --> 00:33:25,848
With your permission, captain,
I'd like to buy the house a round.

359
00:33:26,013 --> 00:33:29,608
Much obliged, Tex, but we're here
on a pretty tricky, salvage operation.

360
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:33,330
I'm Captain Mike Turner,
this here's Wilbur and Celeste, my crew.

361
00:33:33,493 --> 00:33:35,165
- How you doing?
- Pleased to meet you.

362
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:37,642
Tell you what, Captain Mike.

363
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:41,892
You just salvaged yours truly
out of this here wreck.

364
00:33:42,053 --> 00:33:44,613
There's 100,000 in it for your trouble.

365
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:46,411
I can't take your money, Tex.

366
00:33:46,573 --> 00:33:47,892
Anyway, I don't need it now.

367
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:53,447
Well, as one man of substance
to another, let's go right to the mat.

368
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:58,084
I mean, let's not pussyfoot around.

369
00:33:58,253 --> 00:34:01,404
A hundred and fifty thousand
for the three of us.

370
00:34:04,053 --> 00:34:05,042
They're with me.

371
00:34:06,573 --> 00:34:07,847
There's nobody there, sport.

372
00:34:08,013 --> 00:34:10,243
- You're seeing double.
- Triple, maybe.

373
00:34:10,413 --> 00:34:12,608
They must've got lost.

374
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:15,645
Hey!

375
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:18,090
Hey, come on out here, y'all...

376
00:34:18,893 --> 00:34:20,804
...and get yourselves rescued.

377
00:34:23,653 --> 00:34:28,169
- Theresa! Theresa!
- Daddy.

378
00:34:31,013 --> 00:34:32,492
Oh, thank God.

379
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:34,405
Thank you.

380
00:34:37,093 --> 00:34:39,323
- Would somebody catch this, please?
- My baby.

381
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:42,365
Thank God.

382
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:47,363
- Thank you.
- I didn't think I'd see you again.

383
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:48,966
I love you, baby.

384
00:34:51,293 --> 00:34:54,046
He knew she was alive somewhere.
He just knew it.

385
00:34:55,013 --> 00:34:57,527
- Oh, my baby.
- Daddy, this is Larry Simpson.

386
00:34:57,693 --> 00:34:59,046
He saved my life.

387
00:34:59,213 --> 00:35:03,206
I was coming down in the elevator
and the ship turned over.

388
00:35:03,373 --> 00:35:04,886
- I was operating it.
- My baby.

389
00:35:05,053 --> 00:35:07,089
We tried to get out,
but the passageway was on fire.

390
00:35:07,253 --> 00:35:10,211
I fainted, but he pulled me out.

391
00:35:10,373 --> 00:35:12,648
My baby. Look, look, kid, l...

392
00:35:12,813 --> 00:35:14,405
I'm never gonna forget you for this.

393
00:35:20,613 --> 00:35:24,083
Here, here. Your dress is torn.

394
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:28,363
All right, folks...

395
00:35:28,533 --> 00:35:31,366
...let's wet ourselves down
for safety's sake...

396
00:35:31,533 --> 00:35:34,366
...and get this herd
on the road for home.

397
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:35,761
Here.

398
00:35:38,533 --> 00:35:39,727
Wrong year?

399
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:41,246
Wrong time, Tex.

400
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,613
All right, now, we've found
what we wanted.

401
00:35:45,773 --> 00:35:48,810
Each one of you fill a bag
with gold or diamonds and carry it out.

402
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:51,009
Everyone gets 10 percent
of what they carry.

403
00:35:51,173 --> 00:35:52,401
Diamonds.

404
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:54,882
Look, we don't want
your filthy loot around our necks.

405
00:35:55,053 --> 00:35:56,805
Just get us the hell out of here.

406
00:35:57,613 --> 00:36:01,162
Well, perhaps just a few.

407
00:36:48,813 --> 00:36:52,089
Ten percent of this will pay off
the balance on my folks' farm.

408
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,686
Maybe buy me one too.

409
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:57,004
- You, a farmer?
- I will be if I get out of here alive.

410
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,209
Look here, Mr. Hopkins.

411
00:36:59,373 --> 00:37:01,807
We've all gotta have
our wits about us from now on...

412
00:37:01,973 --> 00:37:05,443
...so as they say in Dallas,
drop the bottle, Tex.

413
00:37:05,613 --> 00:37:08,650
What I'm a-holding here means
more to me than...

414
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:11,885
...any two bags of that trash
you got there, captain.

415
00:37:12,213 --> 00:37:16,286
Why this is a original Beaune, 1865.

416
00:37:17,133 --> 00:37:20,330
Maybe only six of them left
in the whole world.

417
00:37:20,493 --> 00:37:24,327
Now I'd a whole lot rather drink it
out in the daylight...

418
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,410
...but one way or another...

419
00:37:26,573 --> 00:37:29,451
...it's a pleasure no man's
gonna deprive me of.

420
00:37:31,213 --> 00:37:32,805
All right, Tex.

421
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:36,684
If disaster strikes, I'll try and give you
a couple of minutes warning.

422
00:37:39,373 --> 00:37:40,601
Okay, everybody, let's...

423
00:37:43,053 --> 00:37:44,042
Where's Suzanne?

424
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:49,852
- Probably in the powder room.
- Suzanne?

425
00:37:51,533 --> 00:37:53,125
Suzanne?

426
00:37:54,893 --> 00:37:56,372
Suzanne?

427
00:37:56,613 --> 00:37:58,524
Suzanne?

428
00:37:59,613 --> 00:38:01,126
She's gone, Mike.

429
00:38:01,573 --> 00:38:04,007
- What do you mean, gone?
- Gone. Split. Disappeared.

430
00:38:04,173 --> 00:38:06,528
She could've gone off with Svevo.
Who knows why?

431
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:08,012
I sure wish I did.

432
00:38:08,173 --> 00:38:10,289
Hazards of the trade, kid.
Hazards of the trade.

433
00:38:10,453 --> 00:38:12,444
Anyone else feel safer with Svevo?

434
00:38:13,653 --> 00:38:14,881
Who's Svevo?

435
00:38:15,053 --> 00:38:18,011
As a matter of fact,
who the devil's Suzanne?

436
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:19,891
All right, let's go, then.

437
00:38:20,333 --> 00:38:23,405
- Mike.
- That's a beautiful bottle.

438
00:38:23,853 --> 00:38:26,128
That's a beautiful bottle of wine.

439
00:38:26,293 --> 00:38:27,692
- Actually...
- Young lady, let me...

440
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:31,528
Actually, sir, you know, I much prefer
a Château Haut-Brion, '50s and '60s.

441
00:38:31,693 --> 00:38:35,686
Odd years. It doesn't really have the bite,
but I much prefer the body, you know?

442
00:38:35,853 --> 00:38:37,127
I surely do.

443
00:38:37,293 --> 00:38:39,682
- Young lady, I most certainly do.
- Yeah.

444
00:38:39,853 --> 00:38:41,172
You ever been to Texas?

445
00:38:41,333 --> 00:38:45,121
No, not I myself. But I had a
great-granddaddy who died at the Alamo.

446
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:46,567
- The Alamo?
- Yeah.

447
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:48,644
- Well, do tell.
- Yeah.

448
00:38:48,813 --> 00:38:51,281
- Hey, monkey, come on.
- Yeah. Coming.

449
00:38:51,613 --> 00:38:53,012
Stefan?

450
00:39:05,693 --> 00:39:07,331
Stefan?

451
00:39:13,293 --> 00:39:14,885
Stefan?

452
00:39:17,493 --> 00:39:19,688
Oh, thank God.

453
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:22,964
Well, doctor...

454
00:39:23,693 --> 00:39:26,253
...aren't you even going to say hello?

455
00:39:34,093 --> 00:39:35,526
Here.

456
00:39:38,413 --> 00:39:42,292
Stefan, I'm petrified. Please, can we just
get out of here as quickly as possible?

457
00:39:42,453 --> 00:39:44,648
It took two years
to put this thing together.

458
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:48,249
I mean, do you really believe
I can get off without it?

459
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:50,085
I've done everything you wanted.

460
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:51,686
And now I just want to get out.

461
00:39:54,253 --> 00:39:55,572
I...

462
00:39:56,253 --> 00:39:57,447
I understand.

463
00:39:59,213 --> 00:40:02,489
Would I have gotten aboard
if I could've avoided it?

464
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:05,611
But since I'm here,
since we're both here...

465
00:40:05,773 --> 00:40:08,367
...we've got to see
this thing through.

466
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:10,171
Besides, I don't have an option, do I?

467
00:40:13,013 --> 00:40:15,925
No, but I do.

468
00:40:20,733 --> 00:40:23,247
Captain Turner,
at least he's looking for a way out.

469
00:40:25,093 --> 00:40:27,482
Well, the choice is yours, Suzanne.

470
00:40:27,653 --> 00:40:29,450
One must do what one must do.

471
00:40:32,213 --> 00:40:34,090
Stefan, I'm sorry.

472
00:40:37,653 --> 00:40:39,405
And I'm sorry too.

473
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:44,482
- Good luck.
- And you.

474
00:40:58,413 --> 00:40:59,607
Doyle.

475
00:41:02,813 --> 00:41:04,212
Kill her.

476
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:14,051
Finish her.

477
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:41,091
Wilbur, is anybody hurt?

478
00:41:41,253 --> 00:41:43,369
Okay up here. Keep moving.

479
00:41:47,493 --> 00:41:48,972
All of you, keep going.

480
00:41:49,133 --> 00:41:50,885
Quick, move down.

481
00:42:00,013 --> 00:42:01,605
Through here.

482
00:42:03,653 --> 00:42:05,723
Quickly, through here.

483
00:42:09,013 --> 00:42:10,571
Wilbur.

484
00:42:20,053 --> 00:42:23,841
Keep going, skipper.
I'll catch up with you.

485
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:33,492
Mike?

486
00:42:35,973 --> 00:42:38,089
- Mike?
- Coming.

487
00:42:42,573 --> 00:42:44,006
Jesus Christ.

488
00:42:44,173 --> 00:42:46,733
- What should we do?
- Start moving furniture.

489
00:42:46,893 --> 00:42:49,930
All right, all right, let's pitch in.
Come on, kid, give me a hand.

490
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:53,563
Get the wino to help you.
Nothing personal.

491
00:42:54,173 --> 00:42:57,768
- Move.
- Here, got it.

492
00:43:21,133 --> 00:43:24,170
Wilbur, what's taking so long?

493
00:43:27,213 --> 00:43:28,646
Wilbur?

494
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:35,324
What do you think you're doing?

495
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:39,486
- Bag of gold. I lost it.
- The hell with the gold.

496
00:43:40,493 --> 00:43:41,926
- Let's get out here.
- Let me get...

497
00:43:42,093 --> 00:43:43,321
Get out.

498
00:43:53,773 --> 00:43:56,287
You crazy old man, you...

499
00:44:01,933 --> 00:44:03,889
I'm sorry, Wilbur.

500
00:44:05,293 --> 00:44:07,011
Is it that bad?

501
00:44:09,453 --> 00:44:11,489
I'll come along.
Go on up there with the others.

502
00:44:11,653 --> 00:44:12,722
Like hell I will.

503
00:44:12,893 --> 00:44:14,929
I don't want them to see me like this.

504
00:44:15,373 --> 00:44:17,807
Not Celeste, anyway.

505
00:44:18,733 --> 00:44:19,768
It'll pass, Mike.

506
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:23,087
- Believe me, it'll pass. It always does.
- Sure, sure.

507
00:44:24,413 --> 00:44:27,052
I think my body's trying
to tell me something.

508
00:44:28,373 --> 00:44:31,968
You don't have to pretend to me, Wilbur.

509
00:44:33,453 --> 00:44:34,727
I know what you've got.

510
00:44:39,373 --> 00:44:42,251
I've been to see that doctor
you're always sneaking off to.

511
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,770
You went and saw the...?

512
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:50,561
What's his name?

513
00:44:52,653 --> 00:44:54,166
Bernheim.

514
00:45:00,693 --> 00:45:04,527
Well, I guess there isn't much
we can do about it, is there?

515
00:45:04,893 --> 00:45:06,565
Of course there is, Wilbur.

516
00:45:07,053 --> 00:45:11,092
As of this morning, we have all
the money we need for an operation.

517
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:18,087
- Do you think you can stand?
- Don't help me.

518
00:45:22,693 --> 00:45:25,571
I can stand better than you...

519
00:45:26,013 --> 00:45:28,083
...for an old man.

520
00:45:35,053 --> 00:45:37,362
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
- God.

521
00:45:37,533 --> 00:45:40,570
Mike. Mike.

522
00:45:43,053 --> 00:45:45,692
- Who are you, ma'am?
- I'm Hannah Meredith.

523
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:54,887
This is my husband, Harold Meredith.

524
00:45:55,333 --> 00:45:58,564
- How do you do?
- It's all right.

525
00:45:59,093 --> 00:46:02,403
You two seem to have taken
all of this very calmly.

526
00:46:02,573 --> 00:46:04,848
I mean, why didn't you try to escape?

527
00:46:05,013 --> 00:46:07,527
In our case, it seemed safer
just to stay right here.

528
00:46:07,693 --> 00:46:09,968
We couldn't risk
being separated outside.

529
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:12,124
Well, I accept the sentiment, ma'am...

530
00:46:12,293 --> 00:46:15,683
...but at this particular point, I strongly
recommend you come along with us.

531
00:46:15,853 --> 00:46:17,764
It'd be very difficult for us
to get out.

532
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:19,685
Well, I'm gonna
have to tell you, ma'am...

533
00:46:19,853 --> 00:46:21,923
...that where we came in
is blocked off.

534
00:46:22,573 --> 00:46:25,883
- The explosions.
- That's right, and there could be more.

535
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,330
- I'm staying here.
- No.

536
00:46:28,493 --> 00:46:31,371
Look, I'm not gonna be
a burden to everyone, I...

537
00:46:33,533 --> 00:46:35,091
I'm blind.

538
00:46:37,613 --> 00:46:40,969
I'm not going to leave the cabin
without my husband.

539
00:46:41,453 --> 00:46:45,207
Hannah, if you find a safe way out,
you can come back.

540
00:46:45,373 --> 00:46:47,841
- Without me, you'll have a better chance.
- No.

541
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,083
Look, I don't mean to be cruel,
and I'm sorry...

542
00:46:50,253 --> 00:46:52,608
...but I think Mr. Meredith here
has a point.

543
00:46:52,773 --> 00:46:54,604
- Daddy!
- Shut up, sarge.

544
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,445
What do you mean?
How much time do we have?

545
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:58,922
We got an hour?
He'll slow us down.

546
00:46:59,093 --> 00:47:01,402
If it's more than an hour,
I'll come back and get him.

547
00:47:01,573 --> 00:47:04,041
- That's very perverted reasoning.
- Frank, you're a creep.

548
00:47:04,493 --> 00:47:06,563
- You heard Meredith himself talking.
- Shut up.

549
00:47:06,733 --> 00:47:07,961
He'll slow us down.

550
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:11,569
- I'll be dead. I don't wanna die.
- Shut up. All of you.

551
00:47:11,973 --> 00:47:15,249
They're both coming with us.
I leave a single soul alive on this wreck...

552
00:47:15,413 --> 00:47:17,483
...I'll throw out my title
to the salvage rights.

553
00:47:17,653 --> 00:47:19,325
Oh, that's crap, and you know it.

554
00:47:19,493 --> 00:47:21,688
I'd bet it that you would
testify against me.

555
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:26,085
Now, let's shove off, Meredith.

556
00:47:26,253 --> 00:47:28,448
I'll carry you if I have to.

557
00:47:28,653 --> 00:47:30,928
I can carry my own weight, thank you.

558
00:47:39,693 --> 00:47:41,684
Hey, hey, take it easy, Pops.

559
00:47:41,853 --> 00:47:44,321
Sorry. And it's Harold.

560
00:47:44,493 --> 00:47:46,484
Mind the step, darling.

561
00:47:46,653 --> 00:47:49,804
Everything's different, remember,
because the ship's upside down.

562
00:47:49,973 --> 00:47:54,205
Can you imagine that man talking to me
as though I were a piece of salvage?

563
00:47:54,373 --> 00:47:56,523
You're luckier than you think,
Mr. Meredith.

564
00:47:56,693 --> 00:47:58,206
Salvage is my business.

565
00:47:59,373 --> 00:48:04,606
- I'll walk along with you.
- I'm the ship's nurse.

566
00:48:04,933 --> 00:48:07,401
Let's have another look
at that deck plan.

567
00:48:08,373 --> 00:48:11,604
I think I must have given it
to what's-his-name, Dr. Svevo.

568
00:48:11,773 --> 00:48:13,126
He must still have it.

569
00:48:13,293 --> 00:48:15,363
What the hell were you
ever sergeant of, Mazzetti?

570
00:48:15,533 --> 00:48:17,171
The Lost Patrol?

571
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,652
Come on.

572
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,046
All right, we know what
we're looking for. Let's find it.

573
00:48:41,453 --> 00:48:43,364
This could take hours.

574
00:48:43,533 --> 00:48:45,171
Damn hull could go down at any second.

575
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:48,487
Unless we get out of here alive,
it's all for nothing.

576
00:48:48,653 --> 00:48:51,008
- I'm gonna find a way out.
- You do what you're told.

577
00:48:51,173 --> 00:48:54,245
I know the way out.
I've got the deck plan.

578
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:57,331
Doyle's dead.

579
00:48:58,253 --> 00:49:00,403
She killed him with an ax.

580
00:49:00,853 --> 00:49:02,730
There's a trail of blood down
the passageway.

581
00:49:02,893 --> 00:49:05,088
- Should I go after her?
- No, she won't get very far.

582
00:49:05,253 --> 00:49:06,891
I need you here.

583
00:49:07,533 --> 00:49:10,206
The crate is marked Sprague Pumps.
Find it.

584
00:49:18,613 --> 00:49:21,286
Wires. Here.

585
00:49:22,213 --> 00:49:24,443
- Turn sideways.
- Turn sideways.

586
00:49:27,293 --> 00:49:29,124
They're behind you.

587
00:49:33,413 --> 00:49:35,722
There's fire here on the right.

588
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:53,566
- Why don't you turn this way.
- Hey, we don't need any more help.

589
00:49:53,733 --> 00:49:56,042
- Keep moving.
- Daddy, he's just trying to be nice.

590
00:49:56,213 --> 00:49:58,249
Look, we don't need nice.

591
00:49:58,613 --> 00:50:00,171
Hold it. Hold it.

592
00:50:00,333 --> 00:50:03,325
I smell grub. Hurry on up, folks.

593
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:06,172
Move on out and I'll lead the way.

594
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:08,329
Good Lord, Tex.

595
00:50:08,493 --> 00:50:10,484
No place for a foot race.

596
00:50:11,813 --> 00:50:13,166
Hot dang it.

597
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:15,403
Would you look at this.

598
00:50:20,173 --> 00:50:22,004
Son of a gun. He sniffed it out.

599
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:25,085
Well, some folks got a nose for water.

600
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:29,405
Me, I got a nose for food and oil.

601
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:34,567
You know, bet there's all kinds of vittles
around here if we wanna look for them.

602
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:36,452
- Hey, Tex.
- Yeah?

603
00:50:36,613 --> 00:50:40,003
Can that educated nose of yours
tell me where the tunnel leads?

604
00:50:40,173 --> 00:50:42,846
No, sir, captain, it sure can't.

605
00:50:43,213 --> 00:50:46,762
In that case, all of you take a rest
and I'll go find out.

606
00:50:46,933 --> 00:50:48,161
I'm going with you.

607
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,202
I can crawl into smaller places
than you can.

608
00:50:52,373 --> 00:50:53,408
No, monkey.

609
00:50:58,773 --> 00:51:00,650
Thanks, Wilbur.

610
00:51:04,973 --> 00:51:06,531
This way.

611
00:51:21,693 --> 00:51:24,002
- Here. Here.
- Thanks, kid.

612
00:51:24,173 --> 00:51:26,209
Here, get something for yourself.

613
00:51:46,213 --> 00:51:47,202
Look.

614
00:52:22,933 --> 00:52:24,730
It's no use.

615
00:52:26,573 --> 00:52:28,131
It's blocked solid.

616
00:52:30,093 --> 00:52:31,685
We're gonna have to...

617
00:52:32,693 --> 00:52:35,366
Hey, we'll find another way out.

618
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:38,684
- It's all right. It's simple.
- I know that. I know that.

619
00:52:39,373 --> 00:52:43,730
Can't a person just come in here and
sit down and cry, for goodness' sakes?

620
00:52:43,893 --> 00:52:46,407
I mean, why do you think I wanted
to come in this tunnel?

621
00:52:46,573 --> 00:52:50,805
God, this is not a good day for me.

622
00:52:51,253 --> 00:52:54,848
Honestly, you just don't
understand me at all.

623
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,931
Understand you?

624
00:52:57,293 --> 00:52:59,887
I don't even know who you are.

625
00:53:02,013 --> 00:53:03,412
I'm Celeste Whitman.

626
00:53:03,573 --> 00:53:05,450
- Hi.
- Hello.

627
00:53:05,613 --> 00:53:09,162
I came to France a year and a half ago
with my boyfriend from Cincinnati.

628
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,051
Where's your boyfriend now?

629
00:53:11,213 --> 00:53:13,204
Cincinnati.

630
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:17,451
How about those
three husbands of yours?

631
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:20,651
Oh, I was never married.

632
00:53:20,813 --> 00:53:23,850
Of course, I could've been married
if I'd wanted to be, a million times.

633
00:53:24,013 --> 00:53:25,332
Millions and millions of times.

634
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:28,485
- There's no doubt about that. None.
- There's no doubt about it. None.

635
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:32,566
I mean, I can do anything that I set my
mind to do, you know? I mean anything.

636
00:53:32,733 --> 00:53:35,850
I have this very high IQ,
if you hadn't noticed...

637
00:53:36,013 --> 00:53:39,085
...and, I don't know,
I'm just sort of this underachiever.

638
00:53:39,253 --> 00:53:40,971
Underachiever?

639
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:43,203
You're the toughest monkey
on this ship.

640
00:53:43,973 --> 00:53:44,962
- Monkey?
- Yeah.

641
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:47,727
You call me monkey.
That's cute, that's really cute.

642
00:53:47,893 --> 00:53:48,882
You call me monkey.

643
00:53:49,053 --> 00:53:53,410
I hate that.
I hate to be called monkey.

644
00:53:53,573 --> 00:53:56,883
I mean, maybe it would've helped
if I wore my long black evening gown...

645
00:53:57,053 --> 00:54:00,045
...but then, I packed it away
with all the rest of my summer things.

646
00:54:00,213 --> 00:54:03,808
- Oh, I wanna get out of here.
- Celeste. Celeste.

647
00:54:03,973 --> 00:54:05,725
- Celeste.
- What?

648
00:54:06,413 --> 00:54:08,324
I think you're beautiful.

649
00:54:08,933 --> 00:54:10,446
You do?

650
00:54:14,613 --> 00:54:16,490
You gonna kiss me now?

651
00:54:16,653 --> 00:54:18,086
No.

652
00:54:18,253 --> 00:54:21,051
Well, then let's just get
the hell out of here.

653
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:22,851
Come on.

654
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:42,564
Hey, kid, what are you doing?

655
00:54:43,333 --> 00:54:44,652
Look, what is the problem?

656
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:46,531
Look, I'm grateful to you, okay?

657
00:54:46,693 --> 00:54:48,524
But we're not out of here yet.

658
00:54:48,693 --> 00:54:50,843
So in the meantime,
keep your distance.

659
00:54:51,013 --> 00:54:53,732
- What are you talking about?
- He knows what I mean.

660
00:54:53,893 --> 00:54:56,009
Theresa, what your father
is trying to tell you...

661
00:54:56,173 --> 00:54:58,243
...is he's concerned I'll tear
your clothes off...

662
00:54:58,413 --> 00:55:00,529
...and make love to you
here in front of him.

663
00:55:01,013 --> 00:55:02,048
- Hey!
- Stop it.

664
00:55:02,213 --> 00:55:03,692
Stop it, stop it.

665
00:55:03,853 --> 00:55:07,163
Don't you think we have enough
problems without that foolishness?

666
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:10,166
Listen, I run a bar in Morristown,
New Jersey. I know what goes on.

667
00:55:10,333 --> 00:55:11,925
This guy's got one thing on his mind.

668
00:55:12,093 --> 00:55:14,732
I've seen old guys in there
with kids as young as my daughter.

669
00:55:14,893 --> 00:55:17,930
Well, thank goodness
I'm only 22 years old, right, Daddy?

670
00:55:18,093 --> 00:55:22,086
Listen, kid, if we get out of here alive,
I'm gonna kill you, you understand?

671
00:55:22,253 --> 00:55:25,006
What are we doing down here?
Sitting on our asses?

672
00:55:25,173 --> 00:55:26,811
You're reading a book, for chrissake.

673
00:55:26,973 --> 00:55:29,885
What else would you suggest
until Captain Turner comes back?

674
00:55:30,053 --> 00:55:31,566
How do you know he's coming back?

675
00:55:32,333 --> 00:55:34,528
How do you know they
didn't find another way out...

676
00:55:34,693 --> 00:55:36,331
...and they're leaving us here to rot?

677
00:55:36,493 --> 00:55:37,926
Frank, so help me...

678
00:55:38,093 --> 00:55:41,972
...you keep running off at the head, you
ain't getting one dang sip of this wine.

679
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,283
Hey, Tex, take that wine
and shove it sideways.

680
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:45,727
I'm talking about our lives.

681
00:55:45,893 --> 00:55:48,282
Mazzetti, if you don't stop griping...

682
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:50,569
...I'm coming over there
and shut you up for good.

683
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:53,725
- Come on over here now!
- Stop.

684
00:55:53,893 --> 00:55:55,292
Hey, how's the party?

685
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:58,126
- You two took long enough.
- Couldn't find a cab.

686
00:55:58,293 --> 00:56:00,329
- Did you find anything?
- Nothing.

687
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:03,929
Listen, everybody,
this shaft's a dead end.

688
00:56:04,093 --> 00:56:06,288
Maybe Svevo found a way out.

689
00:56:06,453 --> 00:56:08,330
Let's go find him.

690
00:56:13,933 --> 00:56:15,810
Mike, it's Suzanne.

691
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:17,292
Get Gina.

692
00:56:17,453 --> 00:56:19,444
Gina. Let her come first.

693
00:56:20,813 --> 00:56:23,088
Gina, Suzanne.

694
00:56:28,653 --> 00:56:30,132
She's dead.

695
00:56:30,413 --> 00:56:32,643
- Captain, this looks to me like...
- I know, I know.

696
00:56:32,813 --> 00:56:35,850
- I've seen bullet holes before.
- What are you saying here?

697
00:56:36,013 --> 00:56:39,403
- There's a killer on the ship somewhere?
- It's that guy Svevo.

698
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:40,972
Maybe.

699
00:56:41,133 --> 00:56:43,010
We only found some of you an hour ago.

700
00:56:43,293 --> 00:56:45,443
We all assume she went after Svevo.

701
00:56:46,453 --> 00:56:48,364
She might not have reached him...

702
00:56:48,813 --> 00:56:50,565
...but she certainly reached somebody.

703
00:56:51,093 --> 00:56:53,732
We can only assume she might have.

704
00:56:53,893 --> 00:56:55,326
Great.

705
00:56:56,813 --> 00:56:59,088
What do you suggest
that we do now, captain?

706
00:56:59,253 --> 00:57:00,971
We have no alternative.

707
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:03,806
- We have to join Svevo.
- What, and get our head blown off?

708
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:07,882
If Captain Turner's right and there is
a homicidal maniac onboard this ship...

709
00:57:08,053 --> 00:57:11,284
...and it's not Dr. Svevo,
then he's in as much danger as we are.

710
00:57:11,453 --> 00:57:13,603
There you go again, "if," "could."

711
00:57:13,773 --> 00:57:15,604
That's not good enough.

712
00:57:16,013 --> 00:57:20,131
Frank, old hoss,
just consider the alternatives.

713
00:57:21,653 --> 00:57:24,645
And we have enough now.
Let's get out. It's all here.

714
00:57:24,813 --> 00:57:26,724
All except for what
I came down here to find.

715
00:57:26,893 --> 00:57:28,690
Sprague Pumps. Keep looking.

716
00:57:29,773 --> 00:57:31,604
Load some of those,
in the unlikely event...

717
00:57:31,773 --> 00:57:34,765
...that the others find their way
up here before we're finished.

718
00:57:36,053 --> 00:57:39,125
What's so damned important
about that one crate?

719
00:57:40,173 --> 00:57:43,131
Only one other person
knew the answer to that question...

720
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,523
...and that's why she had to die.

721
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:49,410
Dr. Svevo. Sprague Pumps.

722
00:57:58,253 --> 00:58:00,164
Now maybe we got a way up and out.

723
00:58:01,973 --> 00:58:04,692
You ready? Let's go.

724
00:58:50,093 --> 00:58:53,403
- Where the hell are we?
- We're about amidship.

725
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,002
Svevo can't be far off.

726
00:58:56,173 --> 00:58:58,846
He's above us and somewhere forward.

727
00:58:59,013 --> 00:59:01,846
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

728
00:59:02,013 --> 00:59:04,607
There are tanks above us, Mr. Meredith.
Large boiler tanks.

729
00:59:04,773 --> 00:59:07,412
Yeah, for desalinization.
Takes the salt out of the water.

730
00:59:07,613 --> 00:59:10,411
I've seen a lot of those tanks
on the docks in Marseilles.

731
00:59:10,573 --> 00:59:14,248
Speaking of Marseilles, how are we
gonna get out of here, captain?

732
00:59:14,413 --> 00:59:16,369
This bottle sure is getting heavy.

733
00:59:16,533 --> 00:59:21,049
Take a look. From now on we keep
moving upwards towards the surface.

734
00:59:21,213 --> 00:59:22,805
Up there.

735
00:59:43,333 --> 00:59:45,972
Get up there before it starts again.

736
00:59:46,893 --> 00:59:48,292
You first, Meredith.

737
00:59:48,453 --> 00:59:49,932
No, let the others go first.

738
00:59:50,093 --> 00:59:52,288
I haven't got time to argue.
Get up there.

739
00:59:52,453 --> 00:59:55,445
Above the pipe you're holding.
It's about 3 feet.

740
00:59:55,613 --> 00:59:57,285
Stand on this pipe.

741
00:59:57,453 --> 00:59:59,728
- Careful, your head.
- Watch your head. Come on.

742
00:59:59,893 --> 01:00:01,724
Give him your cane.

743
01:00:02,013 --> 01:00:03,571
You got his cane?

744
01:00:06,253 --> 01:00:08,005
Did he make it okay?

745
01:00:08,173 --> 01:00:10,084
Not bad. We're helping Gina up next.

746
01:00:10,253 --> 01:00:11,766
Give me that.

747
01:00:12,493 --> 01:00:13,721
- All right. Come on.
- Take it.

748
01:00:13,893 --> 01:00:15,292
This way. Come on.

749
01:00:15,453 --> 01:00:18,172
- Easy.
- Grab his arm.

750
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:21,452
- Give me your hand.
- Hold the pipe above your head.

751
01:00:21,613 --> 01:00:24,332
Come on, get your bag.
Come on, honey, give me your hand.

752
01:00:24,493 --> 01:00:25,767
Come on.

753
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:29,408
- Come on. Hold on.
- Captain.

754
01:00:31,133 --> 01:00:34,091
The hell with it. I'll give you your share.
Get up here.

755
01:00:34,253 --> 01:00:36,642
Hey, come on, honey. Come on.

756
01:00:38,533 --> 01:00:41,843
Frank, Larry, Wilbur, go to the
other side. Tex and I will handle this.

757
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:44,846
- Get out of there, will you?
- I am, I am. Yeah, I am.

758
01:00:45,613 --> 01:00:47,285
Take that side.

759
01:00:49,453 --> 01:00:52,013
Steady. You ready?

760
01:00:52,813 --> 01:00:56,249
Right. Up, steady.

761
01:00:57,613 --> 01:01:01,492
- Quick, look.
- Wilbur, pass it back to Larry.

762
01:01:01,893 --> 01:01:03,406
Push back.

763
01:01:04,453 --> 01:01:06,250
Okay, get it across.

764
01:01:06,413 --> 01:01:07,812
Hold it.

765
01:01:12,013 --> 01:01:14,402
Okay, hold it.
Let me get underneath.

766
01:01:14,573 --> 01:01:16,245
- Push it. There.
- Come on, lift it.

767
01:01:17,613 --> 01:01:19,126
Skipper.

768
01:01:19,573 --> 01:01:21,564
Those doors could be locked tight.

769
01:01:21,733 --> 01:01:23,689
I won't know that
till I get there, will I?

770
01:01:23,853 --> 01:01:25,445
Please hurry.

771
01:01:29,293 --> 01:01:31,124
Put your foot in the bucket.

772
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:54,246
It doesn't look too difficult.

773
01:01:54,413 --> 01:01:56,051
Just keep your eyes on the road.

774
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:16,609
Wilbur, the door's open.

775
01:02:20,973 --> 01:02:22,850
Look out below.

776
01:02:32,813 --> 01:02:34,246
Great.

777
01:02:57,533 --> 01:03:00,570
It's easier now.
I've made a bridge for you.

778
01:03:00,893 --> 01:03:03,646
Okay, who's first?

779
01:03:05,613 --> 01:03:08,685
- I am. I've got the goods.
- Let's go.

780
01:03:12,013 --> 01:03:14,049
Crawl right astraddle of it, little lady.

781
01:03:14,213 --> 01:03:15,202
You ever ride a horse?

782
01:03:15,373 --> 01:03:18,524
Are you serious? She was a professional
jockey for five years.

783
01:03:18,693 --> 01:03:20,729
Three, actually.

784
01:03:31,293 --> 01:03:32,646
Frank?

785
01:03:33,813 --> 01:03:35,087
Thanks.

786
01:03:35,973 --> 01:03:39,409
- Keep your eyes on the road.
- Right.

787
01:03:58,440 --> 01:04:00,795
You know, you're really
a terrific-looking guy.

788
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:01,949
That's all right.

789
01:04:02,120 --> 01:04:04,031
- I was gonna pull you up anyway.
- Yeah.

790
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,760
- Cross the grill and wait in the room.
- Right.

791
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,676
- Gina, you're next.
- Okay, here.

792
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:15,073
Take it easy, Gina.
Take it easy.

793
01:04:25,160 --> 01:04:28,038
- You all right?
- I'm afraid l...

794
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,270
I kept my eyes closed
most of the way.

795
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:31,839
Tell that to Meredith.

796
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:36,198
Cross the grill carefully
and wait in the room with Celeste.

797
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,471
Okay. You next, Hannah.

798
01:04:38,920 --> 01:04:42,708
- You'll watch him?
- How else would I know how to do it.

799
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,112
Give me your hand.

800
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,078
I've gotcha, I've gotcha.

801
01:04:55,240 --> 01:04:57,435
- Put your foot in there carefully.
- Okay.

802
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,156
It's all right, Hal.
I'm up here. I'm safe.

803
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:05,791
Right hand up here. Now, the rungs
are a little higher than a ladder's.

804
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:08,237
Seems simple enough.

805
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,638
You might say I even have
an advantage.

806
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:12,233
How's that?

807
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:14,393
Can't see anything below.

808
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,671
Give me the stick.

809
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,636
- Hannah! Hannah!
- Hang on.

810
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:43,913
Hannah!

811
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:47,560
Hold on. Hold on.
Put your left hand up.

812
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,639
Give it here.

813
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:52,834
Put your feet on the rung.

814
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:55,709
- Hannah!
- Hold on.

815
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,996
- Hannah.
- Pull.

816
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,950
Can you shift his feet?
That's it, slowly.

817
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,833
Now you're right at the top.
Feel the top.

818
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,958
One more, one more.
Now stand still. Let me move.

819
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:20,315
- Hannah?
- She's all right.

820
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,632
- Hannah!
- She's hurt her shoulder.

821
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,677
That's all.
She just hurt her shoulder.

822
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,592
- Thank goodness.
- Stand still, Meredith.

823
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,556
Let me get her. Don't move.

824
01:06:31,160 --> 01:06:33,435
There's a step there, step over.

825
01:06:35,240 --> 01:06:36,468
Watch her arm. Watch her.

826
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,712
Here, lean over my shoulder if you can.
Easy, easy.

827
01:06:39,880 --> 01:06:42,758
Celeste, get her legs if you can.

828
01:06:45,480 --> 01:06:49,155
Now, there's a pipe right in front of you.

829
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,356
- What can I do to help?
- Open the case, Celeste.

830
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,238
Take it easy.

831
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,797
Lean against there.

832
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:01,873
Here.

833
01:07:05,480 --> 01:07:08,358
Her shoulder's dislocated.
She won't get very far this way.

834
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:09,873
What can you do?

835
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:12,679
Pop it back into place if I can.

836
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:16,150
It's gonna hurt a great deal,
Mrs. Meredith. I'm so sorry.

837
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:19,871
Now, step down towards me.

838
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:22,110
- Everybody, come on up.
- Step down.

839
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,396
Right foot. Don't drop this.

840
01:07:24,560 --> 01:07:26,278
Hannah.

841
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:29,671
- Okay, you're up now.
- Hurry, hurry. Come on.

842
01:07:37,640 --> 01:07:40,200
Turn you around and sit you down.

843
01:07:41,160 --> 01:07:44,470
Here. Sit down.

844
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,235
You're a hell of a fellow, Meredith.

845
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:58,474
I don't have that much choice, captain.

846
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:05,151
- What's the matter?
- Just a leg cramp. I'll be all right.

847
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:08,073
I'm not used to all this
physical exertion.

848
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,629
I've got a few aches and pains myself.

849
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:16,358
My wife, she'll need
a great deal of extra attention now.

850
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,631
You know, she tries
to appear brave but...

851
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,995
- Yeah, she's terrified.
- Yeah.

852
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:22,513
Just like me.

853
01:08:22,680 --> 01:08:24,796
Well, not like you...

854
01:08:25,760 --> 01:08:27,637
...but terrified, yes.

855
01:08:28,040 --> 01:08:29,598
And you're not?

856
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:34,870
Captain, I've felt this much
fear and apprehension...

857
01:08:35,480 --> 01:08:37,516
...this much doubt
and lack of confidence...

858
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,558
...in simply trying to cross
an unfamiliar room.

859
01:08:52,680 --> 01:08:54,557
Here's your stick.

860
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,517
Thank you.

861
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,830
Thank you, captain, for everything.

862
01:09:06,519 --> 01:09:09,795
Theresa, your father...

863
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:13,432
...has he always had
such a one-track mind?

864
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:20,189
Well, you know,
his bark is worse than his bite.

865
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:22,554
He means well.

866
01:09:23,919 --> 01:09:25,432
Yeah, well...

867
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:29,596
...I guess if I had a daughter
as pretty as you are...

868
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,193
...I'd probably act the same way.

869
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:36,076
Thank you.

870
01:09:41,159 --> 01:09:43,115
- Wilbur, sarge.
- A body.

871
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,430
- Keep the rest here.
- It's a dead body.

872
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:55,590
The ax must have been waiting for him
as he came around this corner.

873
01:09:55,759 --> 01:09:57,636
- The girl?
- She's gotta be the favorite.

874
01:09:57,799 --> 01:09:59,710
And look where she wound up.

875
01:10:00,319 --> 01:10:03,231
Now we've got Svevo
between us and the surface.

876
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:05,592
Stay here.

877
01:10:06,319 --> 01:10:08,355
All right, we're gonna spread out.

878
01:10:08,519 --> 01:10:11,113
Go down the passageway.
Half on one side, half on the other.

879
01:10:11,279 --> 01:10:13,918
If anything happens, hit the deck
and then run like hell.

880
01:10:14,079 --> 01:10:15,068
Come on. Come on.

881
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:17,355
- Sarge?
- Okay, come on.

882
01:10:17,799 --> 01:10:19,596
Come on, come on.

883
01:10:19,759 --> 01:10:21,954
Watch your foot. Come on.

884
01:10:40,559 --> 01:10:42,390
Do you wanna go first?

885
01:10:43,399 --> 01:10:45,230
Well, you go first, then.

886
01:10:57,639 --> 01:10:59,277
They've been here, that's for sure.

887
01:10:59,439 --> 01:11:01,794
What the hell would they be looking for?

888
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:06,319
- You guys need a fourth for bridge?
- Turner, look over here.

889
01:11:11,719 --> 01:11:13,949
There's enough here to start a war.

890
01:11:14,439 --> 01:11:16,999
Well, that's a slight exaggeration.

891
01:11:17,159 --> 01:11:18,911
I'm sorry about this, captain.

892
01:11:19,879 --> 01:11:21,995
I had hoped that we would
never meet again.

893
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:25,754
Who's that? What does he want?

894
01:11:25,919 --> 01:11:29,309
He's your basic garden-variety terrorist,
and I think he wants to kill us.

895
01:11:29,479 --> 01:11:33,028
Well, however accurate the second part
of your statement may be, please...

896
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:37,829
...don't confuse me with some
politically impotent bomb thrower.

897
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:41,555
The truth is, I came aboard this ship with
a purer motive than Captain Turner...

898
01:11:41,719 --> 01:11:45,507
...to recover a piece of property
which was already mine.

899
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:49,228
You can take whatever you want
from this ship. You're welcome to it.

900
01:11:49,399 --> 01:11:51,390
But these people have come
a long way...

901
01:11:51,559 --> 01:11:54,995
...and all they want right now
is to get the hell out of here alive.

902
01:11:55,159 --> 01:11:58,071
Now, as one man of substance
to another...

903
01:11:59,519 --> 01:12:01,191
Now, hold on.
Just hear me out, son.

904
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:05,835
Tell you what, I'll write a check
for the whole shebang here...

905
01:12:05,999 --> 01:12:08,229
...and you can just lay down
your little rifles...

906
01:12:08,399 --> 01:12:12,312
...and we'll all haul ass
out of here together. What do you say?

907
01:12:12,479 --> 01:12:15,118
Take a look at that open crate
behind me, captain.

908
01:12:15,279 --> 01:12:19,238
I sincerely doubt that your friend
over there could reimburse me for that.

909
01:12:19,399 --> 01:12:21,469
Okay, open it. Let's see.

910
01:12:22,359 --> 01:12:25,317
You open that barrel, captain,
and we all die.

911
01:12:25,479 --> 01:12:30,314
And I have every reasonable hope
of wanting to watch the sun set tonight.

912
01:12:30,479 --> 01:12:33,596
What's this crap you're dishing out here?
What are you trying to tell us?

913
01:12:33,759 --> 01:12:36,193
You got some doomsday machine
in there or something?

914
01:12:36,359 --> 01:12:38,873
With the information
commonly available today...

915
01:12:39,039 --> 01:12:43,237
...any enterprising science student
could build a nuclear device.

916
01:12:43,919 --> 01:12:46,558
- Uranium?
- Plutonium.

917
01:12:46,719 --> 01:12:50,109
And as the American government
is painfully aware...

918
01:12:50,279 --> 01:12:53,191
...this isn't the first shipment
to go astray.

919
01:12:53,799 --> 01:12:56,472
Son, now listen to me.

920
01:12:56,639 --> 01:13:00,837
If I was to tell you that I got
certain connections at the Pentagon...?

921
01:13:00,999 --> 01:13:05,151
Then I would have to tell you
that my connections are more powerful.

922
01:13:06,759 --> 01:13:09,478
I had never intended
to harm anyone, captain.

923
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:13,151
But as you must realize,
I can't let you go now.

924
01:13:31,239 --> 01:13:33,195
- Get out of here and I'll cover you.
- No way.

925
01:13:33,359 --> 01:13:34,758
No way. We go together.

926
01:13:34,919 --> 01:13:37,194
Get out of here.
They need you more than I do.

927
01:13:37,959 --> 01:13:39,631
Come on. Come on.

928
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:42,667
Okay. Cover me.

929
01:13:42,839 --> 01:13:43,828
Go.

930
01:13:48,759 --> 01:13:51,398
Hey, kid, get the hell out of here.
What are you doing?

931
01:13:51,559 --> 01:13:52,787
I'm staying.

932
01:13:53,959 --> 01:13:55,517
- All right, kid.
- All right, Daddy.

933
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,635
- Be ready to move, right?
- Right.

934
01:13:57,799 --> 01:13:59,027
- Go.
- Go.

935
01:14:03,399 --> 01:14:04,673
Go!

936
01:14:11,559 --> 01:14:13,231
After them.

937
01:14:30,839 --> 01:14:32,511
Wilbur.

938
01:14:35,079 --> 01:14:36,990
Get in there. Come on.

939
01:14:37,479 --> 01:14:38,878
Steady.

940
01:14:51,919 --> 01:14:55,878
The crates. The crates.
Here, here.

941
01:15:00,759 --> 01:15:02,750
Take cover behind the crates.

942
01:15:46,359 --> 01:15:47,917
Save your ammo.

943
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:49,478
We've gotta shut that door.

944
01:15:49,639 --> 01:15:51,914
If they can't get at us,
they won't hang around long.

945
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:54,912
Svevo's gotta deliver that plutonium
as soon as possible.

946
01:15:55,079 --> 01:15:59,834
Now, when I say go,
we rush the door together.

947
01:15:59,999 --> 01:16:02,513
Hey, kid, kid.
Get down there.

948
01:16:02,679 --> 01:16:05,512
Put short bursts into that door
until we've tried to close it, okay?

949
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,112
Get down.

950
01:16:09,959 --> 01:16:12,632
- Ready, Larry?
- Ready.

951
01:16:13,479 --> 01:16:14,912
- Ready, sarge?
- Yeah.

952
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:16,478
Go.

953
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:32,631
Hey, I knew I wasn't
gonna make it out of here.

954
01:16:32,799 --> 01:16:37,475
Turner, take care of my little girl.
I'm all she's got.

955
01:16:37,959 --> 01:16:39,028
You still got a chance.

956
01:16:39,199 --> 01:16:41,110
You gotta get her out of here,
you understand?

957
01:16:41,959 --> 01:16:43,278
She's gonna make it.

958
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:46,951
If I do, she will.

959
01:16:47,119 --> 01:16:48,347
Swear to God?

960
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:50,547
I swear, sarge.

961
01:16:53,639 --> 01:16:56,517
A grenade.
Aim at that leaky porthole.

962
01:16:56,679 --> 01:16:58,715
We'll blast them open,
then lock them in.

963
01:16:58,879 --> 01:17:00,870
They'll drown quickly.

964
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:03,913
Now.

965
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:08,348
Hit the deck!

966
01:17:17,519 --> 01:17:19,714
- What's the matter?
- I got hit.

967
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:30,874
- Daddy.
- Hey, baby.

968
01:17:31,439 --> 01:17:33,316
It's all right.

969
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:38,277
What are you gonna do
without me to yell at you anymore?

970
01:17:41,439 --> 01:17:44,033
- I never... I never wanted to yell at you.
- I know.

971
01:17:44,199 --> 01:17:46,952
- I tried to be a good father.
- I know.

972
01:17:47,119 --> 01:17:49,758
You, you live your life.

973
01:17:52,199 --> 01:17:55,271
I love you, Daddy.
I love you.

974
01:17:56,399 --> 01:17:58,390
God bless you.

975
01:18:03,359 --> 01:18:04,758
No.

976
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:09,749
Daddy!

977
01:18:21,519 --> 01:18:23,874
- What happened?
- It's okay.

978
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:27,395
- It's just a fragment. You're lucky.
- It's my lucky day.

979
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,387
- Let's go.
- How do we get out?

980
01:18:37,559 --> 01:18:39,595
The same way we came in.

981
01:18:40,199 --> 01:18:41,791
What about him? He's still alive.

982
01:18:41,959 --> 01:18:45,315
Well, that's unfortunate,
because we're leaving without him.

983
01:18:51,039 --> 01:18:53,473
That porthole's gonna go
at any moment.

984
01:18:53,639 --> 01:18:57,154
We gotta find another way
out of here, and right now.

985
01:19:12,599 --> 01:19:14,237
What is that metallic sound?

986
01:19:14,399 --> 01:19:18,028
It's a... Like a car
banging against the wall.

987
01:19:18,919 --> 01:19:20,716
That's a door, that's not a wall.

988
01:19:20,879 --> 01:19:24,155
It's not a solid sound.
That's... That's a door!

989
01:19:40,039 --> 01:19:41,870
He's right. There is a door.

990
01:19:42,039 --> 01:19:43,392
Move these.

991
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:06,392
There's a ladder to the right.
Swim for it.

992
01:20:06,559 --> 01:20:09,119
- Hannah.
- Mrs. Meredith, get Mrs. Meredith.

993
01:20:13,919 --> 01:20:15,113
Come on, ma'am.

994
01:20:15,279 --> 01:20:18,430
Oh, I'm sorry.
Didn't mean to hurt you.

995
01:20:28,959 --> 01:20:31,075
Careful. Careful.

996
01:20:51,279 --> 01:20:53,998
Harold! Harold!

997
01:21:07,879 --> 01:21:11,838
Larry, give me the gold.

998
01:21:25,919 --> 01:21:28,114
Hang on, hang on.

999
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,914
Sorry, sorry.

1000
01:21:38,039 --> 01:21:39,518
- Oh, God.
- Hang in there.

1001
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,354
All right, help.

1002
01:21:48,999 --> 01:21:50,751
- Hal, are you all right?
- Yes.

1003
01:21:50,919 --> 01:21:54,275
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1004
01:22:05,599 --> 01:22:08,113
Take it easy. Nice and slow.

1005
01:22:08,279 --> 01:22:10,918
You ready? Okay.

1006
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:25,150
I'm here.

1007
01:24:29,279 --> 01:24:30,951
Meredith.

1008
01:24:39,479 --> 01:24:41,276
I'm sorry.

1009
01:24:42,399 --> 01:24:43,832
God.

1010
01:24:44,319 --> 01:24:46,514
- Oh, God.
- Take care of him.

1011
01:24:52,039 --> 01:24:53,791
Mr. Meredith.

1012
01:24:56,839 --> 01:24:59,399
Come on. Sit down. Sit down.

1013
01:24:59,559 --> 01:25:01,789
Hey, come on.

1014
01:26:09,639 --> 01:26:11,197
Okay, everybody can come in here.

1015
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,032
Come on.

1016
01:26:16,199 --> 01:26:19,077
Keep an eye on them.
I'm gonna have a look around.

1017
01:26:21,919 --> 01:26:23,477
All right, in here.

1018
01:26:29,919 --> 01:26:33,070
Come on.
We're staying in here.

1019
01:27:10,919 --> 01:27:13,956
You'd be better off
paying attention to me.

1020
01:28:17,119 --> 01:28:19,269
It's gonna leave a little scar.

1021
01:28:19,999 --> 01:28:24,356
Well, at least I've still
got my dazzling personality.

1022
01:28:24,839 --> 01:28:26,875
Gina, you know what?

1023
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:28,995
This may sound silly...

1024
01:28:29,159 --> 01:28:31,912
...but if I had my way, only one
other person would ever see it.

1025
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,278
- What do you think?
- Well, l...

1026
01:28:35,439 --> 01:28:38,829
I know, he treats me like a creep,
but at least he knows I'm alive.

1027
01:28:40,599 --> 01:28:44,194
- Lf we get out of this.
- Yeah.

1028
01:28:53,279 --> 01:28:54,553
Tex?

1029
01:28:54,719 --> 01:28:56,152
Tex.

1030
01:28:59,839 --> 01:29:03,718
- Would you do me a favor?
- Shoot, it's done, little lady.

1031
01:29:05,319 --> 01:29:09,471
If I don't get out of here,
and you and Mike do... I mean, just if.

1032
01:29:09,639 --> 01:29:11,869
- Mike has a very big mortgage
on his tug...

1033
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:14,599
...and the J<i>enny</i> may be the only
thing in the world he wants.

1034
01:29:14,759 --> 01:29:18,035
Heck, you're loaded.
Would you take care of it for him?

1035
01:29:18,199 --> 01:29:22,590
That's not doing nobody a favor.
That's just being decent, hon.

1036
01:29:23,119 --> 01:29:25,030
Tex, you're okay.

1037
01:29:33,919 --> 01:29:34,988
Can I help you?

1038
01:29:41,319 --> 01:29:42,388
Thanks anyway.

1039
01:29:44,519 --> 01:29:49,912
You know, you're a kind-hearted lady.
I've been watching you.

1040
01:29:52,119 --> 01:29:54,075
You helped Meredith.

1041
01:29:55,159 --> 01:29:57,150
And you helped everybody
that needed help.

1042
01:29:57,439 --> 01:30:00,670
- I am a nurse, you know.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

1043
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:05,390
I'll tell you what else I know.

1044
01:30:05,999 --> 01:30:11,392
There are a few I would've liked to have
beaned over the head with a bedpan.

1045
01:30:11,719 --> 01:30:13,198
I know what you mean.

1046
01:30:13,799 --> 01:30:16,472
I was the head nurse for 12 years
in a Philadelphia hospital.

1047
01:30:16,639 --> 01:30:19,995
- And some of those girls, I...
- Why did you leave?

1048
01:30:21,159 --> 01:30:26,187
Well, when they gave me
my 20-year gold service pin...

1049
01:30:26,359 --> 01:30:28,315
You're not that old.

1050
01:30:29,839 --> 01:30:34,754
- It suddenly dawned on me that
Philadelphia wasn't quite as romantic...

1051
01:30:34,919 --> 01:30:37,479
...as a Greek isle in the moonlight.

1052
01:30:38,439 --> 01:30:42,318
So I resigned
and signed on the <i>Poseidon</i>...

1053
01:30:42,479 --> 01:30:44,549
...hoping to add a little spice
to my life.

1054
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:47,279
You spiced it up all right.

1055
01:30:54,679 --> 01:30:56,795
Happy New Year, everybody.

1056
01:30:57,319 --> 01:30:59,594
I think I've found a way out.

1057
01:30:59,759 --> 01:31:00,794
- Celeste?
- Yeah?

1058
01:31:00,959 --> 01:31:05,157
Wilbur, I've got a job for you.
The rest of you, stay here for a moment.

1059
01:31:15,399 --> 01:31:17,037
If we get out...

1060
01:31:18,559 --> 01:31:21,357
When. When we get out of here...

1061
01:31:21,839 --> 01:31:25,149
...and you go home,
where will that be?

1062
01:31:27,399 --> 01:31:28,514
I don't know.

1063
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:32,358
Back to New Jersey, I guess.

1064
01:31:34,319 --> 01:31:36,196
Well, I've been thinking.

1065
01:31:36,359 --> 01:31:38,919
Maybe you'd like to go back
to lowa with me for a while.

1066
01:31:41,839 --> 01:31:45,309
Hey, it's a whole lot farther away
from the ocean than New Jersey.

1067
01:31:47,879 --> 01:31:49,517
This is our only way out.

1068
01:31:49,679 --> 01:31:52,876
There is a cargo hatch not too far down.

1069
01:31:53,039 --> 01:31:56,156
We swim out
and then up to the surface.

1070
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:59,436
Swim underwater? Well, shoot.

1071
01:31:59,599 --> 01:32:04,229
Unless you can round up a sea horse for
me to ride, you can just count me out.

1072
01:32:04,599 --> 01:32:06,635
Wilbur, Celeste, speed it up, will you?

1073
01:32:12,839 --> 01:32:15,034
- Wilbur?
- Forget it.

1074
01:32:15,399 --> 01:32:18,232
Wilbur, you gotta just hang on now.
We're so close to getting out.

1075
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,230
We're all gonna get out
if you just hang on.

1076
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:22,276
You just try and keep up with me.

1077
01:32:22,839 --> 01:32:24,511
What the hell's keeping them?

1078
01:32:24,679 --> 01:32:27,068
Celeste? What the hell
is going on in there?

1079
01:32:27,239 --> 01:32:29,673
I'm getting my hair done, dummy.
What do you think?

1080
01:32:29,839 --> 01:32:31,875
Go ahead. Pick up the gear
and take it in there.

1081
01:32:32,039 --> 01:32:34,792
- I'll come along in a moment.
- What's taking so long?

1082
01:32:34,959 --> 01:32:37,268
Get going. Go ahead. Go ahead.

1083
01:32:38,399 --> 01:32:39,878
Come on, go.

1084
01:32:53,159 --> 01:32:55,719
It's getting worse,
isn't it, old man?

1085
01:32:55,879 --> 01:32:58,677
It would get much better
if you'd stop calling me old man.

1086
01:32:59,559 --> 01:33:03,711
Well, you just stay close to me
all the way home.

1087
01:33:04,119 --> 01:33:05,518
Is that understood?

1088
01:33:08,919 --> 01:33:12,195
You grew up to be one hell
of a nice man, you know that?

1089
01:33:13,159 --> 01:33:15,798
And you were such a rotten kid.

1090
01:33:18,599 --> 01:33:19,873
Now.

1091
01:33:25,319 --> 01:33:28,117
- Ready?
- Ready.

1092
01:33:33,039 --> 01:33:35,428
None of us are experienced divers,
captain.

1093
01:33:35,599 --> 01:33:37,396
It's our only way out.

1094
01:33:37,559 --> 01:33:39,868
I'm gonna turn you all into frogmen.

1095
01:33:40,039 --> 01:33:42,189
No one has a choice.

1096
01:33:42,959 --> 01:33:46,395
There should be two more, Wilbur. I
counted four between the eight of them.

1097
01:33:46,559 --> 01:33:49,756
One is empty.
The one I'm getting is half full.

1098
01:33:50,639 --> 01:33:53,517
- Who's gonna get the scubas?
- Everyone.

1099
01:33:53,919 --> 01:33:56,228
Last time I went to school
three didn't go into eight.

1100
01:33:56,399 --> 01:33:58,867
- What did you say?
- Three doesn't go into eight.

1101
01:33:59,039 --> 01:34:00,711
With him, it's possible.

1102
01:34:00,999 --> 01:34:03,559
You mean Jacques Cousteau
never taught you buddy breathing?

1103
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:07,268
- What's buddy breathing?
- More than one diver on a single tank.

1104
01:34:07,439 --> 01:34:09,794
Wilbur and I've done it before,
so we'll use the least air.

1105
01:34:09,959 --> 01:34:12,757
It will be about more than enough
in there for the both of us.

1106
01:34:12,919 --> 01:34:15,672
- Yeah, then I'll take what's left over.
- Okay.

1107
01:34:15,839 --> 01:34:19,229
Gina, you and Meredith
are the team on the second tank.

1108
01:34:19,719 --> 01:34:22,313
Which leaves Theresa, me and Tex.

1109
01:34:22,479 --> 01:34:25,437
Well, you can forget about me.
I'm staying here.

1110
01:34:25,599 --> 01:34:28,193
If you get out, why,
you can come back and get me.

1111
01:34:28,359 --> 01:34:29,587
Not today, Tex.

1112
01:34:29,759 --> 01:34:33,468
Listen to me, all of you!
I'm a phony!

1113
01:34:33,639 --> 01:34:35,072
A $3 bill!

1114
01:34:35,559 --> 01:34:39,393
I haven't got no money.
No oil wells.

1115
01:34:39,559 --> 01:34:42,517
And right now, not a hell
of a lot of self-respect.

1116
01:34:44,439 --> 01:34:47,317
You've all been
straight aces with me...

1117
01:34:47,479 --> 01:34:50,516
...and I just didn't want
you to find out about it later on.

1118
01:34:50,679 --> 01:34:53,955
You worked in the galley on this ship,
didn't you, Tex?

1119
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:56,155
That's pretty close.

1120
01:34:56,839 --> 01:34:58,875
I'm the assistant wine steward.

1121
01:34:59,039 --> 01:35:02,349
That's how come this bottle
meant so much to me.

1122
01:35:02,759 --> 01:35:05,432
Means more to me
than a whole year's salary.

1123
01:35:06,919 --> 01:35:08,238
How'd you know, captain?

1124
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:11,869
Even a bloodhound couldn't smell
a cold pie in a refrigerator at 100 feet.

1125
01:35:12,919 --> 01:35:14,716
You had to know where
that kitchen was.

1126
01:35:14,879 --> 01:35:18,394
Then why the ruse, Mr. Hopkins?
What was the point of it all?

1127
01:35:18,559 --> 01:35:20,515
To survive.

1128
01:35:20,679 --> 01:35:26,197
The way I had it figured out, why,
the rich always get saved first anywhere.

1129
01:35:27,039 --> 01:35:31,191
I just never thought that we'd all
wind up like this, down here together.

1130
01:35:31,359 --> 01:35:36,877
Well, that's the way
we're going out, Tex, together.

1131
01:35:37,519 --> 01:35:41,558
Okay, girls, let's get this gear on your
back, and I'll show you how to use it.

1132
01:35:49,519 --> 01:35:51,237
Don't you think we can go now, doctor?

1133
01:35:51,639 --> 01:35:56,269
If I thought so, I would've suggested it.
Our mission is still incomplete.

1134
01:35:56,439 --> 01:36:00,512
The one marked Sprague Pumps,
bring it up now.

1135
01:36:04,839 --> 01:36:09,788
The one last thing to remember
is don't panic and you'll be okay.

1136
01:36:10,319 --> 01:36:11,991
Okay, Celeste.

1137
01:36:14,439 --> 01:36:16,794
Remember the order you go in.

1138
01:39:01,199 --> 01:39:02,951
Where's Wilbur?

1139
01:39:03,119 --> 01:39:05,428
He's still down there.
I'll get him.

1140
01:40:18,359 --> 01:40:19,917
I couldn't find him.

1141
01:40:20,079 --> 01:40:23,071
- I'm gonna get the tug. Stay here.
- I'm going with you.

1142
01:41:36,919 --> 01:41:38,591
Stay there.

1143
01:42:15,519 --> 01:42:18,875
Release that anchor on the back.

1144
01:42:29,799 --> 01:42:32,359
J<i>enny</i>, please don't let me down now.

1145
01:42:35,719 --> 01:42:37,914
Here's a rifle. Use it.

1146
01:42:40,999 --> 01:42:45,151
They're alive. There they are.
Don't let them get away.

1147
01:42:48,959 --> 01:42:50,756
Well, shoot, you idiot!
Shoot! Shoot!

1148
01:42:50,919 --> 01:42:53,149
It's jammed. I'm trying.

1149
01:42:54,159 --> 01:42:56,389
Shoot, for Pete's sake. Shoot.

1150
01:42:56,599 --> 01:42:58,715
Aim at the boxes.
Maybe you'll hit one of them.

1151
01:43:18,879 --> 01:43:22,269
- Tex, let me help you.
- I'm okay.

1152
01:43:35,519 --> 01:43:38,272
- Oh, my gosh, I shot one of them.
- Well, shoot another one.

1153
01:43:38,439 --> 01:43:40,669
Drop back and get the gun.

1154
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:51,558
Come on, Tex. Swim for it.

1155
01:43:54,839 --> 01:43:56,397
Faster!

1156
01:43:57,279 --> 01:43:59,076
The man in the water.

1157
01:44:03,079 --> 01:44:04,990
For you, little lady.

1158
01:44:06,439 --> 01:44:08,828
Tex! Tex!

1159
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:17,670
- Let's haul them in.
- Okay.

1160
01:45:54,759 --> 01:45:58,354
Poor Wilbur. Why did he do it?

1161
01:45:58,999 --> 01:46:01,274
We only had two air tanks left.

1162
01:46:02,279 --> 01:46:04,315
He knew we never had a chance...

1163
01:46:05,519 --> 01:46:07,669
...so he gave whatever life he had left.

1164
01:46:09,479 --> 01:46:11,754
I really loved that old man.

1165
01:46:14,519 --> 01:46:16,350
What are you gonna do now?

1166
01:46:16,559 --> 01:46:18,595
Go back to your chateau?

1167
01:46:19,719 --> 01:46:22,108
There is no chateau.

1168
01:46:23,079 --> 01:46:24,307
Someplace must be home.

1169
01:46:25,359 --> 01:46:27,714
I'm open to suggestions.

1170
01:46:29,159 --> 01:46:32,674
Well, I'd sign you on the J<i>enny</i>...

1171
01:46:33,159 --> 01:46:36,515
...but the bank's gonna take the
boat away the minute we reach port.

1172
01:46:37,919 --> 01:46:40,035
Maybe not.

1173
01:46:47,759 --> 01:46:49,715
Gonna kiss me now?

1174
01:46:50,999 --> 01:46:53,149
I was gonna kiss you anyway.

1175
01:46:54,149 --> 01:47:04,149
