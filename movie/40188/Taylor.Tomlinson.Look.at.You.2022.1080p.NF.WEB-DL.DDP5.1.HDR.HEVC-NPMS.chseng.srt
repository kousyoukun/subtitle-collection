‪NETFLIX 原创喜剧特辑

2
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:39,456
‪有请泰勒汤姆林森！

3
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,550
‪谢谢大家！

4
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,429
‪谢谢！

5
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,935
‪感谢大家能来！

6
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,396
‪谢谢！

7
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,026
‪我由衷地感谢大家能来
‪这几年真是太难了

8
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,571
‪某次我剪了刘海之后
‪生活一下就黑暗了

9
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,908
‪我其实也不是想要刘海
‪我只是想要被关心

10
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,785
‪剪刘海确实有效

11
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,244
‪如果你发一张带刘海的自拍

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,706
‪大家都会跟帖一个火焰颜文字
‪说：“姐妹 美了！” 然后私信我

13
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,874
‪“你还好吗？”

14
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,753
‪我的故事是这样的 我去剪了刘海

15
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:31,090
‪两天后 我第一次尝试了迷幻蘑菇

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,760
‪我刚吃上那些蘑菇

17
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,680
‪我就想：“我应该先吃蘑菇的”

18
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,520
‪“吃了蘑菇 我就会放过自己
‪就不会搞这些刘海了 对吧？”

19
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,899
‪但你知道吗？剪刘海跟吃蘑菇
‪感觉是一模一样的

20
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,569
‪全程你都在看着你朋友
‪说：“我是不是看起来很怪？

21
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,906
‪我如果看起来很怪
‪你们会老实告诉我吧？是不是…

22
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,783
‪这种不同是不好的吗？
‪还是没那么好的…

23
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,077
‪我改主意了 我不剪刘海了

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,453
‪太迟了吗？已经剪下去了吗？

25
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,497
‪罢了 我也就凑活当当这个人吧”

26
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:07,460
‪我又重新开始了心理咨询
‪在座的有人也在接受心理咨询吗？

27
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,841
‪大部分都是女性 这就是问题所在

28
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,594
‪心理咨询真的很难持续下去

29
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,847
‪我之前的咨询师告诉我
‪当我想要与人拉近关系时

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,431
‪我有一种自我贬低的倾向

31
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,392
‪我当时觉得那都是鬼话

32
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,893
‪所以我跟她玩了消失

33
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:27,147
‪后来 我又开始接受心理咨询

34
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,190
‪因为我终于约够了人了

35
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,486
‪这些人都给了我一致的反馈
‪就是我的性格太糟

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,780
‪当这种评价达到一定程度后
‪你可能会想

37
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,325
‪“可能真是我的问题！

38
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,787
‪那些人都留下了评论
‪还毫无二致地指向同一个答案

39
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,913
‪真烦人”

40
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,832
‪所以在几年前我经历了
‪一次非常惨痛的分手之后

41
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,834
‪我终于开始严肃地正视自己

42
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,213
‪并告诫自己：“好的 泰勒
‪五个男人里有五个认为 在争吵中

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,800
‪你的表现就跟
‪困在垃圾袋里的浣熊一样

44
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,140
‪可能是时候吃点氯硝安定片了

45
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,684
‪或者去打一下狂犬病疫苗”

46
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,104
‪我现在已经得到了充分的药物治疗

47
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,106
‪有人也是吗？在吃抗抑郁药？

48
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,650
‪药物治疗？很好

49
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,360
‪都吃的什么药？喊出来

50
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,324
‪左洛复？依地普仑？

51
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,119
‪你看看 全齐活了！

52
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,538
‪真是！我也在吃一些药

53
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,583
‪但我可不会说是什么
‪这是非常隐私的事 但…

54
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,128
‪我开玩笑的 我在吃好几种药

55
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,923
‪我有氯硝安定片
‪是恐慌发作时需要的

56
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,717
‪我很高兴我现在有了氯硝安定
‪因为在这之前

57
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,053
‪在我开始接受药物治疗前
‪我的恐慌症可能会在

58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,638
‪我一定得去某些地方的时候发作

59
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,515
‪那往往是最糟糕的时候
‪因为你只能先把恐慌

60
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,853
‪先夹住 收起来
‪跟没空排泄的宿便一样

61
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,522
‪你懂这感觉吧？就像你说：“好的

62
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:54,442
‪我已经拉出来六成了

63
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,904
‪我还没拉完 但我必须去工作了

64
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,406
‪剩下四成 回头再说

65
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,660
‪或者在午餐时段 去大公厕解决一下
‪如果那里没人的话”

66
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,290
‪我也有其他药 是应对睡眠问题的

67
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,794
‪因为我有夜惊症
‪这没有什么轻松诙谐的方式来形容

68
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,089
‪“尖叫着醒来 还…”

69
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,758
‪我吃的这些助眠药片可管用了

70
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,134
‪它并不会让你不做噩梦

71
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:23,388
‪但它的确在噩梦发生的时候
‪抑制住了你的某种动作

72
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,432
‪听起来很糟糕 但在吃药之前

73
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,643
‪我总是在噩梦中惊醒 感到非常害怕

74
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,561
‪但现在我可以在噩梦中

75
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,691
‪保持睡着的状态
‪直到这个噩梦自然结束

76
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,694
‪也算是给了我某种完结感

77
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,488
‪就像：“老天 他最后还是捅了我

78
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,867
‪好的 剧情大反转了 噩梦沙马兰”

79
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,455
‪我本以为我也在吃抗抑郁药

80
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,623
‪其实并没有

81
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,042
‪我在吃的其实是情绪稳定剂

82
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,378
‪也可用作为抗抑郁药

83
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,297
‪一个关于处方药的有趣事实

84
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,675
‪医生开具的所有药品
‪实际上可能用于四种不同病症

85
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,470
‪所以你不会知道你到底有什么问题

86
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,806
‪直到你遇到了一个有效的药物组合

87
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,726
‪并且亲自上网搜索了你吃的所有药物

88
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,021
‪所以在药物堆里摸爬滚打多年之后

89
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,398
‪我终于找到了
‪对我行之有效的药物组合

90
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,401
‪而在那六个月后 我决定自己去
‪谷歌一下它们 也不知道咋想的

91
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,528
‪结果就是 我吃的所有药物

92
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,198
‪主要用于治疗双相情感障碍

93
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:28,036
‪所以我就回去找我的心理医生
‪我说：“你好

94
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,790
‪你是觉得我…”

95
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,254
‪她就说：“是的！”

96
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,517
‪我回：“这就是
‪你们告知病人的鬼方式？”

97
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,063
‪她就说：“当然不是
‪我们之前也不知道

98
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:59,067
‪但我很高兴我们现在搞清楚了”
‪我当时就想：“我们？”

99
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:02,278
‪我说：“你之前真不知道我是
‪双向情感障碍？”

100
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,947
‪她说：“当然不知道 我们认为
‪我们是在治疗焦虑和抑郁”

101
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,617
‪我就说：“好的 因为这就好像

102
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,037
‪把你家狗子该吃的药
‪裹到芝士里骗它吃一样”

103
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,587
‪我就说：“我不知道该怎么面对
‪这样的诊断结果”

104
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,131
‪她说：“如果能让你感觉好点的话
‪你不需要说

105
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,635
‪你是双向情感障碍
‪你可以说你有双向情感障碍”

106
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,470
‪这就跟有人会说

107
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,515
‪“我觉得你这样做很贱”

108
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,068
‪现在我很高兴得知自己
‪是双向情感障碍这件事

109
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,613
‪因为我吃着对的药 还戴着情绪戒指
‪一切都在掌控之中

110
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,742
‪但当我刚得知的时候
‪真相真是难以下咽

111
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,953
‪我可是咽下过很多药片的人

112
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,955
‪因为当你刚得知那样的事时

113
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,041
‪你会觉得：“我要不要告诉别人呢？

114
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,001
‪我应不应该告诉他人？”

115
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,462
‪如果我决定告诉他人

116
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,756
‪我够不够火辣

117
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:08,511
‪或者够不够有才华
‪能成为启迪他人的人？

118
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,438
‪就比如我有了个什么
‪其他人也有那个东西

119
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,356
‪而他们知道了我也有

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,068
‪他们是会为此感到高兴还是难过？

121
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,487
‪因为我刚拿到诊断结果时
‪医生就开始历数一些人名

122
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,698
‪“你知道还有哪些人是双向吗？

123
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,450
‪赛琳娜戈麦斯”

124
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:34,370
‪我就觉得：“那可让我好受多了

125
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,123
‪她美极了

126
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,542
‪好的 我是双向 没问题的”

127
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,587
‪我不是成长于一个

128
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,214
‪非常注重心理健康的家庭

129
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,382
‪我们家非常信教

130
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:50,094
‪不知道你们有没有尝试
‪告诉家中的保守父亲

131
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,264
‪你有心理疾病的事情？
‪这过程可不太顺利

132
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,100
‪我上高中的时候
‪我试过说：“爸 我感觉我抑郁了”

133
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,812
‪他回：“你只是需要蛋白质
‪去吃一勺花生酱吧”

134
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:05,276
‪没错 现实中就是有这么多老爸
‪干什么事都纯凭意志力 咬牙度过

135
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,447
‪死磕那瓶积富花生酱
‪仿佛它就是答案

136
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,908
‪就跟暴风雨里的那个浮标一样

137
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,285
‪“都会过去的！”

138
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:19,790
‪我爸给我唯一的心理健康建议是

139
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,584
‪在我上高中某次遭遇恐慌发作的时候

140
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,003
‪我当时还不知道那是什么
‪所以压力非常大

141
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,962
‪“我不知道怎么办

142
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,131
‪有这种感觉的时候
‪我不知道该怎么办”

143
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,425
‪他说：“好吧

144
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:35,806
‪我能告诉你的
‪就是当你有这样的感觉时

145
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,561
‪尽量离你关心的人远点 越远越好

146
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:45,816
‪直到你感觉不一样了再回来”

147
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,737
‪这明明是你给一个狼人的建议

148
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,326
‪“跑进林子去吧 直到你不是怪物了
‪你再回来”

149
00:08:55,409 --> 00:09:00,081
‪“别让别人看到你变身
‪他们不会接受真实的你”

150
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,545
‪我有朋友在我准备开始吃药的时候
‪吓了我一跳

151
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,630
‪他们说：“我吃过了
‪抗抑郁药我试过了

152
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,258
‪但我不喜欢吃过药的感觉
‪我感觉不像我自己了”

153
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,095
‪现在我也吃着药 我感觉：“对
‪我也感觉不是自己 这可太好了”

154
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,140
‪我吃药的时候 还是能做自己

155
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,728
‪我只是感觉吃完药
‪有人坐在我身上 说：“嘘

156
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,107
‪别说了 你会毁了一切 我们…

157
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,441
‪我们是想帮你

158
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:31,070
‪如果你把嘴闭上
‪现在可能已经结婚了

159
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,657
‪记得吗？对 我们也是
‪我们只是想帮你 快睡吧

160
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,867
‪选择别的冒险旅程吧”

161
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,084
‪他们也会警告你吃药的副作用

162
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,420
‪他们会说：“你的性欲可能会下降”

163
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,715
‪说实话 自从我开始服药
‪我已经体会过这个了

164
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,218
‪但我不知道是因为我的性欲降低了

165
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,805
‪还是我的自尊心提高了

166
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,515
‪你们知道那种感觉吗？

167
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,897
‪是我没了那个心情？还是我已经
‪不需要对方的认可？是哪种呢？

168
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,317
‪因为抑郁会让你卑躬屈膝

169
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:13,571
‪你会想：“反正我都已经这样了
‪不如让别人舒服点”

170
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,658
‪“不想浪费这趟旅途”

171
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,037
‪如果这段你没笑出来
‪那恭喜你 你的血清素状态良好

172
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:26,500
‪如果你还问：“什么是血清素？”
‪别担心 你体内的量够够的了

173
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,509
‪我本来不是很确定
‪要不要在台上讲这个事

174
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,846
‪后来我需要一些新素材
‪就只能“跳楼大甩卖！全部清仓”

175
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,768
‪说真的 我挺惊讶的

176
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,437
‪因为我原来觉得讲这件事不太好
‪我一直以为自己思想还挺开放

177
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,689
‪并且我不认为有任何人应该因为

178
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,358
‪被诊断为心理疾病而感到沮丧

179
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,360
‪因为这只是关于你的一些信息

180
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,820
‪可以帮助你更好地关爱自己

181
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,698
‪是的

182
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,450
‪有双向情感障碍没什么错

183
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,577
‪是双向情感障碍
‪就跟不知道怎么游泳是一样的

184
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,953
‪可能有些不好意思说出口

185
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,581
‪可能有某些地方不太方便去

186
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,882
‪但不是有那种充气游泳臂圈吗？

187
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:19,220
‪如果你能拿上你的游泳臂圈

188
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,765
‪你就哪儿都能去了

189
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,811
‪我知道有人会说：“但是泰勒

190
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,687
‪如果有人议论我带游泳臂圈呢？”

191
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,898
‪那些人也不在乎你的死活

192
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,691
‪所以管他呢？

193
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,945
‪让他们去边上待着点吧

194
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:37,780
‪大概吧

195
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,956
‪话虽如此 但一定要记得
‪带上你的游泳臂圈

196
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,042
‪明知道自己不会游泳

197
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,085
‪硬要去大众泳池游泳

198
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:54,380
‪还跳进深水区 麻烦到其他人
‪也不是什么酷炫的行为

199
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,301
‪当时你挣扎着拍打水面说你没事时
‪其他人觉得你要淹死了

200
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,804
‪然后有个善良帅气的人跳进来救你

201
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,639
‪你说：“你看 我没事
‪我绝对会游泳！”

202
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,768
‪他们会说：“不 你在把他拉下水

203
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:11,856
‪你正在把凯文变成你的游泳臂圈

204
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:16,026
‪这段感情对凯文来说不太公平”

205
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,363
‪之后你看到有人从你身旁
‪背朝下 仰着漂浮而过

206
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,614
‪你说：“这搞什么鬼？”

207
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,493
‪有人就说：“在泳池里
‪那些人是有家长帮扶的

208
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,958
‪直到人们能够相信他们不会死掉

209
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,670
‪这是你的游泳臂拳 你拿好”

210
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:37,339
‪当时我对告诉朋友这件事非常紧张

211
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,842
‪我认为告诉他们我是双向情感障碍
‪他们会改变对我的看法

212
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,094
‪之后我告诉了我所有的朋友
‪没有人改变看法

213
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,555
‪这还挺侮辱人的

214
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,893
‪因为我曾有朋友告诉我他们是双向

215
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,270
‪而我的回复是
‪“什么？你？怎么可能？”

216
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:55,232
‪我跟朋友们说过后 他们都是这样
‪“终于印证了

217
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,568
‪这解释了很多事情”

218
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,154
‪我跟我最好的朋友达斯汀说了

219
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,741
‪他的反应是：“你的心理健康问题
‪就跟你的中间名一样

220
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,912
‪我根本不知道那是啥
‪但我知道你肯定有”

221
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,086
‪挺好笑的

222
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,257
‪这并不是我不断
‪从约会对象那里收到的反馈

223
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,677
‪也不是让我重新就医的最后一根稻草

224
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,764
‪每个我约会过的男人都会说
‪我有信任障碍

225
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:30,100
‪其实不过是你揭穿谎言的当下
‪他们一贯的说辞

226
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,692
‪“你有信任障碍 宝贝” 而你有
‪一个漂亮同事和一个上锁的手机

227
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,367
‪我的确有信任障碍
‪但也是我从经验里得来的教训

228
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,993
‪我确实得到过教训

229
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,704
‪我大学时候被劈腿了 我的大学男友

230
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,873
‪背着我跟性工作者睡了

231
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:57,211
‪也就是妓女 如果你是老人家
‪且不知道这个词已经不合适再用了

232
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,713
‪有时候年长的人类成员会有些困惑
‪他们会发出类似疑问

233
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,423
‪“什么是性工作者？”

234
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,093
‪“我孙女在照片墙上的
‪那些行为算吗？”

235
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,304
‪你回：“不是的 她是漂亮姑娘
‪在拍某美妆礼盒的开箱视频而已

236
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:11,267
‪绝对两码事 不一样的

237
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:15,479
‪你孙女没有 那不是份工作

238
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:19,567
‪甚至不是真的”
‪总之就是不能再用“妓女”这词了

239
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,611
‪称呼性工作者为“妓女”
‪就跟称呼喜剧演员为“小丑”一样

240
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:26,740
‪理论上是没错
‪但这样说很混蛋 所以…

241
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,703
‪但当我告诉我的心理医生
‪我被劈腿的经历时

242
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,663
‪她也没说那些我期待她会说的话

243
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,624
‪就比如“可怜的你 亲爱的
‪今天这次咨询就算你免费”

244
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,589
‪她反而说道：
‪“你这样可能是自证预言效应”

245
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,050
‪我有点惊讶
‪她立刻说：“不 这是件坏事”

246
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:51,140
‪我就问：“那我能说
‪我有自证预言效应吗？

247
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,686
‪赛琳娜戈麦斯
‪也是自证预言效应吗？”

248
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,316
‪我问：“我是自证预言效应
‪到底是什么意思？”

249
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,278
‪她的解释是：“有时我们觉得
‪有些人会对我们不好

250
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,781
‪所以我们就像这事已经发生了一样
‪消极对待对方 直到这事真实发生

251
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,241
‪你觉得那人会劈腿

252
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,535
‪所以你就对他的态度
‪就好像他已经劈腿了

253
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,497
‪直到对方真的劈腿了
‪这时你会说：‘看 我早说过？’”

254
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,668
‪我当时心想

255
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,923
‪“所以我是个女巫了？”

256
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,390
‪她说：“很接近了 你是个女混蛋”

257
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:39,063
‪我说：“我不管
‪我只听到格兰芬多在召唤我”

258
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,361
‪我在花功夫解决我的信任障碍

259
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,488
‪我刚开始见咨询师的时候
‪情况更糟糕

260
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,365
‪头几回咨询的时候 我就问她

261
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,619
‪“跟我约会的男人 一接我电话就说
‪‘嘿 美女？’”

262
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:58,374
‪她问：“这有什么问题呢？”
‪我就说：“我也还不知道呢

263
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:03,754
‪但等我查到这个‘美女’是谁…”

264
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,256
‪她就说：“你觉不觉得
‪他说的可能是你？”

265
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,343
‪我就：“抱歉 我以为我们是来这里
‪侦破真相的”

266
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:12,554
‪我觉得我现在挺可爱之类的了

267
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,515
‪但我小时候可是个
‪有着实诚父母的丑孩子

268
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,977
‪那样的经历绝对深入骨髓 对吧？

269
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,979
‪如果你是个有着实诚父母的丑孩子

270
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,398
‪你长大后变得多迷人 都无关紧要

271
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,150
‪比如有人夸赞你“你今天真漂亮”
‪你的反应是

272
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:28,112
‪“你就睁眼说瞎话吧
‪我自己啥模样我心里清楚”

273
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,616
‪我十岁的时候
‪我问：“爸 我好看吗？”

274
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,244
‪他的回应是：“听着…

275
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,499
‪我也不是长得最帅的 对吧？

276
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,669
‪不是的 但我每天醒来 都在努力

277
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:47,339
‪我冲个澡 换上体面西装

278
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,341
‪我就很好”

279
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:52,511
‪然后他就出门上班了

280
00:16:53,429 --> 00:16:55,848
‪而我长大成为了喜剧演员 大概吧

281
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,726
‪这就是他对十岁女儿的回应

282
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,730
‪就好像在说：“你和我 傻脸二人组
‪这是老天给发的牌 就这样吧

283
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,106
‪把自己拾掇干净 穿戴整齐

284
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,693
‪这就是我们唯一能做的
‪别头发湿着就睡觉 千万别

285
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,195
‪有时候可以戴个帽子
‪遮一遮这个脑袋

286
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,448
‪对不起 要遮的部分有点多”

287
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,826
‪我知道我漂亮 并且有个大头

288
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,413
‪我清楚地知道这一点 是因为
‪跟我约会的每个男人都这么说过

289
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:22,082
‪“我喜欢你的大头”

290
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,501
‪这是我最喜欢的部分了

291
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,046
‪就是他们夸你的点
‪是你最讨厌自己的那部分

292
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:32,009
‪他们会说：“我喜欢你软软的胳膊”
‪我心想：“好吧

293
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,763
‪那我喜欢你怪怪的蛋蛋
‪这话感觉怎么样？

294
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,519
‪被接纳的感觉如何？”

295
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,647
‪我绝对是约会的噩梦

296
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:48,442
‪不管你说什么好话 做什么好事
‪我都会不当回事

297
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:53,238
‪我曾约过的一个男人说 跟我调情
‪就像大力击打水面

298
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,033
‪我不懂：“是因为调情没用吗？

299
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,786
‪还是因为你拍打水面看起来很傻？”

300
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,457
‪他说：“你听到自己说的话了吗？”
‪我就：“听到了啊 这不是刚说完”

301
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,878
‪然后他就劈腿了
‪所以预言得到了验证！

302
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,925
‪我控制不了 每当我跟个男人
‪开始一段恋情的时候

303
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,677
‪我就预设他的任何善举

304
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,639
‪都是他欺骗所有人的招数

305
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:23,811
‪先生 我可不会落入你
‪精心编排的大戏中呢

306
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:27,689
‪我会想：“这是你的套路吗？

307
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:32,027
‪你在约会时帮我开了车门
‪这是不是你的招数？

308
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,738
‪你都是靠这些套路骗人的吗？

309
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,449
‪还挺可爱的 这招肯定吃香吧

310
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,579
‪这又是你的招数？

311
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,164
‪你陪我去我爷爷的葬礼

312
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,874
‪在雨中帮我撑伞 高过头顶

313
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,627
‪这是不是你的套路？

314
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,338
‪这又是你的惯用手法吧？

315
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,175
‪就像‘小心 别淋湿’
‪‘我淋到了’ 那一套的吧

316
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:06,270
‪我可不是第一次参加这种竞技表演了
‪我以前可是既有爷爷 也有外公

317
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,320
‪现在这又是

318
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,240
‪你的套路吗？

319
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,075
‪在相邻的医院病床上
‪你在我旁边死去

320
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,328
‪都86岁了 还永远牵着我的手

321
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,498
‪这就是你的把戏吗？
‪这就是你把妹的招数吗？”

322
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,668
‪他会说：“我们都在一起60年了”

323
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,504
‪我会说：“你个炮男 我就知道！

324
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:38,385
‪别把我跟这家伙一块埋
‪我知道他背着我跟别人死一块了

325
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:42,097
‪我虽然没证据 但他用便盆的时候
‪查下他的手机就知道了”

326
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:47,644
‪所以我们得去做心理治疗了

327
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,147
‪人们害怕去看心理医生

328
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,983
‪因为他们认为 那就是有个人
‪坐在椅子上说：“你烂透了”

329
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:57,362
‪但情况并非如此
‪是你坐在椅子上说：“我烂透了”

330
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,949
‪而你的咨询师
‪会说：“很好 我们就从这开始”

331
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,912
‪心理咨询只是帮你深度剖析
‪你是垃圾的原因 好吗？

332
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:05,829
‪你去了咨询室

333
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,831
‪想的是：“这是我所有的缺点”

334
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,708
‪她说：“好的”
‪然后把所有缺点摆到墙上

335
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,336
‪好像你们俩在携手破案 真有趣！

336
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,380
‪然后她会掏出些红色绳子
‪就是侦探们在家会用的那种

337
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,967
‪剧情往往是他们因为离经叛道
‪被开除出探案组

338
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,262
‪然后她开始把你的那些缺点

339
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,974
‪跟你的童年创伤联系起来

340
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,810
‪然后你才恍然大悟：“老天
‪所以我才会变成这样”

341
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,562
‪她会说：“所以你才会这样”

342
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:35,359
‪你会问：“那我现在治好了吗？”
‪她会说：“当然没有！

343
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,569
‪远远还没有”
‪你接着问：“那我该怎么办呢？”

344
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,947
‪她说：“你每周都来这做心理咨询

345
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:44,117
‪带上你的信用卡”
‪你：“什么？那我还能治好吗？”

346
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,870
‪她说：“我也不知道
‪总之带你的信用卡来就是了！”

347
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,168
‪我在治疗中的确认清了许多事

348
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:57,714
‪比如我是个情绪性进食者
‪不知道在场有没有这样的人

349
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:59,049
‪很好 有七个人

350
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,385
‪其他人都想：“我们不是
‪我们只吃到八分饱

351
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:04,179
‪然后感谢上帝赐予我们食物 好吗？

352
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,932
‪食物对我来说 只是燃料”

353
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,685
‪如果你是这么想的
‪快出门离场 好吧？真的

354
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,688
‪我会退票钱的 我不需要你的支持

355
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,107
‪我维持得还不错

356
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,235
‪如果你不知道什么是情绪性进食者

357
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,737
‪就是你通过吃来应对不舒服的情绪

358
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:25,409
‪比如我如果感到悲伤、焦虑或清醒
‪我会用吃来缓解和安慰

359
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,286
‪如果你还是不确定自己是不是

360
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,121
‪可以通过几个问题来进行自我判断

361
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,665
‪问题一 当你在公共场合
‪吃墨西哥玉米片时

362
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:35,335
‪你会对他人在场
‪看到你吃而感到生气吗？

363
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:40,924
‪你觉得墨西哥玉米片应不应该
‪随包附带防窥拉帘？我觉得应该

364
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,680
‪你生命中 所有最美味的餐食

365
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,684
‪是不是都发生于深夜11点
‪在你自己的车内？

366
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,145
‪旁边路灯还忽明忽暗地闪烁？

367
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,442
‪你有没有在吃布朗尼蛋糕的时候

368
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,610
‪其实你心情不错

369
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,865
‪但希望自己可以边难过边吃

370
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,493
‪因为这样吃起来更香？

371
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:12,873
‪听起来更像是我们七个人会有的情况

372
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,504
‪在治疗中 我知道了自己
‪是从童年的哪天开始成为

373
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,422
‪情绪性进食者的

374
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,966
‪当时我八岁 在厨房吃贝果面包

375
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,301
‪我爸走进来 对我说

376
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,554
‪“你把贝果放下 我得告诉你点事”

377
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,390
‪然后他就告诉了我母亲去世的消息

378
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:34,436
‪所以我脑子里有什么机关打开了似的

379
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,566
‪“当你停下吃面包的手

380
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,361
‪有人就要羽化升天了”

381
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,490
‪我回去继续上四年级的时候
‪就跟死亡天使似的

382
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,950
‪其他小孩还在念
‪“踩中路缝 你妈背疼”这种烂童谣

383
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:53,663
‪我已经是
‪“不吃面包 你妈死掉 小子

384
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,416
‪后半段怎么没人教你们？”

385
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:01,046
‪我八岁的时候有些大舌头
‪我跟你们说 是因为当时没人告诉我

386
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,966
‪他们在我入学一年后才把我拉到一旁

387
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,967
‪有人说：

388
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,220
‪“泰勒 你的老师觉得你可能
‪有一些语言障碍方面的困扰”

389
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,889
‪我问：“什么是语言障碍？

390
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,142
‪你们确定找对人了吗？因为…

391
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,520
‪我现在可厉害了”

392
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,771
‪他们说：“你什么都没做错

393
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,648
‪你只是有些发音有一点不同

394
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,608
‪比如平翘舌的区分
‪把‘是’说成‘斯’

395
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,944
‪这样说 能明白吗？”
‪我当时就回答

396
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,490
‪“如果有的话 我一定会注意到的

397
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:32,410
‪比如我现在说的是‘斯’
‪而不是‘斯！’

398
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,830
‪希望你早点找到你要找的人

399
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:38,250
‪如果你还有后续问题
‪我就在跷跷板那边”

400
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,883
‪我知道关于离世母亲的段子
‪会让人不舒服

401
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,344
‪我知道的 而且如果你感到不适

402
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:53,265
‪我也不知道该说什么
‪你应该多努力 然后你上来讲

403
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,068
‪老实说 我从来都不希望
‪大家因为这件事而感到不适

404
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,195
‪以至于我以前跟所有人都撒谎

405
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,948
‪在我的成长历程里
‪我总是说我父母是分居了

406
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,616
‪这样我就不必说我妈妈已经过世了

407
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,577
‪这个谎言一直非常有效

408
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,038
‪直到有天我的一个朋友发现我撒谎了
‪她非常沮丧

409
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,083
‪她说：“你妈妈去世了？

410
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,460
‪泰勒 你不是说你爸妈分居了吗？”

411
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,255
‪我回：“他们是的啊

412
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,717
‪被耶稣分居的”

413
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:36,349
‪她双亲都还健在 所以她可能不知道
‪这个谎说得有多好笑

414
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,018
‪但总会明白的吧 对吧？

415
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,896
‪这可是个缓慢但后劲十足的梗

416
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:44,941
‪就跟癌症一样
‪就跟我得癌症的过程一样

417
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,194
‪好的 好吧

418
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,448
‪波士顿的观众们 接下来的安排是

419
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:57,454
‪我们还有大概
‪六分钟的离世母亲段子要讲

420
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,751
‪我知道
‪你们可能会觉得六分钟好长啊

421
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,253
‪不会感觉很漫长的
‪我已经给她都铺垫好了

422
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,130
‪我已经为我的离世母亲准备了

423
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,051
‪镶嵌了众多丁丁段子和流行文化梗
‪的精美棺材

424
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,637
‪所以接下来的六分钟里
‪大家都能找到属于自己的乐子

425
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,598
‪你会笑、会哭 会忘掉了她已经死了

426
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,393
‪但我知道作为观众的你们
‪现在也在经历着很多事情

427
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,978
‪你们可能想：“泰勒 我们是好人

428
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,814
‪好人不会因为离世母亲的段子
‪笑出声的”

429
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,610
‪我想说 如果你们
‪想在喜剧表演的现场当好人

430
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,947
‪真是蹉跎岁月 虚度光阴

431
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,032
‪想在喜剧表演的现场当好人

432
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,243
‪就像是想在主题公园里
‪开展环保回收活动

433
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:40,038
‪你来都来了 已经上了贼船
‪就都放松一点 尽兴一些

434
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,292
‪而且我知道你们都是好人 你们会说

435
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,044
‪“泰勒 我们已经认识你25分钟

436
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,922
‪我们不希望那些不好的事情
‪发生在你身上 一次也不要”

437
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,715
‪谢谢你们 波士顿的观众

438
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,760
‪但你们要知道
‪那些不好的事已经发生了

439
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,096
‪而我现在拿着麦克风 讲着这些事

440
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,307
‪在所有买票入场观看的观众面前

441
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:03,353
‪这意味着 这些不好的事情
‪已经变成了金钱

442
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,815
‪你觉得我在这个年纪

443
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,820
‪就这么成功 我能有个还活着的妈？

444
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,622
‪怎么可能！

445
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,667
‪我会是个创意写作课老师
‪非常爱自己

446
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,503
‪不食人间烟火 根本不懂
‪你们这些乡下人在想什么 好吧？

447
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,298
‪她上了天堂
‪而我上了Netflix

448
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,633
‪一切都很圆满！

449
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,729
‪这是我在咨询时真说过的话

450
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,606
‪我咨询师的反馈是

451
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,942
‪“你这周应该来两趟”

452
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,326
‪有些人会觉得我八岁时就要经历这些
‪非常难过

453
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,286
‪但八岁是一个
‪失去某位家长的黄金时期

454
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,372
‪因为那时候太傻了
‪根本不知道发生了什么

455
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,874
‪我八岁的时候

456
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:09,044
‪我唯一知道有妈不在了的人
‪就是迪士尼公主们

457
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:13,923
‪我那会儿心想的是 这确实糟透了
‪但我是不是要变美了？

458
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,217
‪然后我到青春期了 就变成了

459
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,887
‪“好吧 不是那样的 现在上帝大概
‪比较讨厌我吧 真倒霉”

460
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,183
‪这只是玩笑 上帝才不会讨厌任何人
‪至少不会再讨厌了

461
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,646
‪你们有没有读过《旧约》？老天

462
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:34,611
‪圣经的《旧约》就是我最爱的
‪泰勒斯威夫特专辑 就像是…

463
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,992
‪一首接一首的最爱单曲 比如

464
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,744
‪“你不相信我？

465
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:46,498
‪蛇出没！看你如何把我逼向绝境”

466
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,336
‪我是个二十多岁的白人女性 当然了

467
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:54,589
‪我要把我们泰勒比作上帝了 是吧？

468
00:27:54,672 --> 00:27:58,176
‪她可是我唯一信奉的神 好吗？

469
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:03,181
‪我可没看到上帝本帝
‪重制自己那点旧东西

470
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:07,727
‪老实说 他应该这么做的
‪因为现在有着圣经版权的人烂透了

471
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,570
‪那么小的时候就失去一位家长
‪的确会让你快速成长

472
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,866
‪我八岁时候就看过死尸了
‪意思是我见到尸体 远远早于

473
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,201
‪我见到一个丁丁

474
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,371
‪这的确不是事情发展的正确顺序

475
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,416
‪《美国女孩身体成长手册》
‪说的可不是这样

476
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,505
‪也可能顺序本该这样
‪因为你知道这事有多疯吗？一个丁丁

477
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,841
‪远比你妈妈的死尸要能造成更大伤害

478
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,093
‪老天 这创伤要严重许多了
‪我看到我的母亲 我想的是

479
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,178
‪“这位女士曾给我做过零食
‪但现在她直挺挺地躺着”

480
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,972
‪我第一次看到一个丁丁时

481
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,475
‪我想的是：“老天！
‪谁把赫特人贾巴的眼睛挖下来了？

482
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,353
‪你可啥也没帮我做过 不行

483
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,523
‪不行！我可一次也没喊出过
‪‘阴间大法师’的名号！”

484
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:57,902
‪我也没看过那么多丁丁
‪但我实在不想再看到了

485
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,945
‪不是我恐男

486
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,614
‪我还是出于某些原因会被男性吸引
‪但我向上帝发誓

487
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,909
‪每当你看到一条新丁丁时
‪都会有一个调整期

488
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:09,998
‪对不对？这个过程很快的 就想这样
‪然后我们就回到现实

489
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,501
‪我恋爱的时间太长了

490
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,963
‪因为我就是无法做好准备去
‪亲眼目睹一条活体丁丁

491
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,924
‪就是一丁障目 无法拨云见日
‪不管是字面还是比喻

492
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,428
‪我就是无法接纳 来不了

493
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,346
‪而且…

494
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,642
‪我不管你见过多少条丁丁
‪每次见到一个新的

495
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,187
‪就像是跳进冷水池里

496
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,483
‪感觉是：“好的 让我游一会儿
‪习惯一下这里的温度

497
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:41,070
‪好的 现在这个比上一个深一点
‪但没关系

498
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,741
‪没问题的 所以我们都得带游泳臂圈

499
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:47,035
‪就是为这样的时候准备的”

500
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:55,543
‪控制一下呼吸 不就是
‪辣妹盛夏泳池趴吗？你可以的

501
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,880
‪想到众多可选的男性生殖器类型

502
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,257
‪我会觉得丁丁们看起来友好了一些

503
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,177
‪它们起来了 它们很高兴见到你
‪它们在摇摆 我从来没做爱过

504
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:08,139
‪跟一条长在前面的尾巴一样 对吧？

505
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,266
‪我会自己去网上搜的 没事

506
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,728
‪以上都是猜想 我也从没看过阴道
‪包括我自己的 因为我是个基督徒

507
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,730
‪但我听说的是

508
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:19,734
‪那下面阴森森的
‪就是一个黑暗阴森的洞口

509
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,236
‪有个洞？对不起 什么？

510
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,489
‪每次有人给我指交时候 我都想说
‪“你怎么这么轻信呢？

511
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,242
‪因为我自己都不知道
‪那个洞口通向哪里

512
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,912
‪可能通向我存储双向情感障碍的地方
‪也可能是…

513
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:37,961
‪存那东西的… 如果你刚好看到了
‪能帮我刮点出来吗？能吗？

514
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,589
‪就跟作用在心理健康上的
‪宫颈抹片一样？可以吗？

515
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,842
‪别这样戳 你得把手指弯起来

516
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,969
‪就跟婴儿噎食时用的手指清除法一样
‪你会懂吗？

517
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,471
‪如果你直接戳 就会把它推进去
‪那就太晚了

518
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,725
‪如果你弯曲手指 转一下
‪就能勾出来

519
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,480
‪我喜欢讲这个段子
‪因为虽然有点跑题

520
00:30:57,564 --> 00:31:00,483
‪但的确能学到点知识
‪以后还能救人呢

521
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,242
‪我很喜欢想象多年后的一个场景
‪有人会告诉我

522
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,787
‪“如果不是你讲的那个丁丁段子
‪我侄子就活不到现在”

523
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,713
‪最疯的事情是 我母亲死于癌症

524
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,715
‪你看吧？差点忘了这事吧

525
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:29,178
‪我父亲再婚了 我的继母也得了癌症

526
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,598
‪她没事 别担心
‪我不会二次伤害你们的

527
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,977
‪那是上帝对我爸说的话

528
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,316
‪我继母一经确诊
‪我和我家里的其他孩子就想：“老天

529
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:45,320
‪是老爸在传染癌症给别人吗？”

530
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,572
‪我们以为他是致癌物

531
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,324
‪我们就想着千万别让他碰微波炉

532
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,242
‪他一定是这样把癌症传染给别人的

533
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,661
‪要是他再干掉一个老婆

534
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,080
‪我们就得在他基督珍爱相亲网的
‪账户上放警告了

535
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,540
‪就那些很基础的 比如…

536
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,710
‪“你好 这里已知有化学物质
‪会导致癌症

537
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,922
‪交往娱乐 后果自负”

538
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,132
‪我感觉有些人不相信她还活着

539
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,802
‪她完全没事
‪她是位开心健康的伟大女性

540
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,221
‪我们通常直接称呼继母为母亲
‪因为当我爸跟她结婚的时候

541
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,389
‪反正也没人在用这个称呼

542
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:16,392
‪所以我们也没问题
‪“对啊 叫母亲好了 谁在乎啊”

543
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,686
‪真是抱歉 如果你的校长辞职了

544
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,565
‪你有了一位新校长 不会这样介绍吧
‪“这位是丽萨” 对吧…

545
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,863
‪就让她当校长吧 毕竟有个职位空缺

546
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,492
‪而且那时我们都还小
‪我爸非常快就再婚了

547
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,621
‪我猜他有点想模仿《夺宝奇兵》
‪快点把她们对掉过来

548
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,164
‪这样就不会有任何人注意到

549
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,041
‪你知道 当你还是小孩的时候
‪你的仓鼠死了

550
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,918
‪而你父母根本不想向你
‪解释死亡这件事

551
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,045
‪于是他们就给你新买一只一模一样的

552
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,507
‪还说：“没有 那就是康妮
‪只是现在会咬人了” 我爸也差不多

553
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,842
‪只是不是仓鼠 是妈妈们

554
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,720
‪但我以前从来不说这些的

555
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,931
‪从来不会说我妈妈已经过世

556
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,724
‪因为我不想让人们不舒服

557
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,768
‪而且就跟我们这些
‪有着童年创伤的人一样

558
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,478
‪应该在座的所有人都会有

559
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,605
‪如果你今晚坐在这里 想着：
‪“我觉得我没有

560
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,732
‪我有着完美父母 完美童年

561
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,944
‪而且这场‘喜剧表演’
‪我也不觉得那么有意思”

562
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,530
‪挺好

563
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,540
‪我希望今晚是你一生中最糟的一晚

564
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:25,044
‪因为听起来你的人生一帆风顺

565
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,922
‪可能需要一些全新的视角

566
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,342
‪我们中的大多数人都会有童年创伤

567
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,593
‪等到你终于长大 你会想

568
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,762
‪“挺过来了 再也不用纠结那个了

569
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,682
‪看我手里大把的钥匙
‪机会在手 世界我有”

570
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,060
‪然后你就把那些童年发生的黑暗
‪一直压抑着

571
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,063
‪藏进去 压下去
‪直到你再也不用去想

572
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,399
‪那在很长一段时间里都是有效的

573
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,193
‪直到有一天

574
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,279
‪你在路边狠狠地撞到了脚趾

575
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,698
‪你就开始在街上无法控制地啜泣起来

576
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,618
‪你会想：“这肯定是因为别的事情

577
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:02,040
‪我一直把我的创伤藏在那个小脚趾里

578
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,294
‪然后我挤了挤 现在它到处都是了

579
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,796
‪移动到这里来了”

580
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,925
‪如果你留着不处理
‪那些创伤就会一直干扰你

581
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,844
‪以一种你甚至无法意识到的方式

582
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:17,472
‪我在心理咨询中意识到
‪因为母亲很年轻就过世

583
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,184
‪我会有这种没道理的认知
‪认为我自己也会英年早逝

584
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:24,062
‪所以我的生活方式一直
‪很激烈 很不健康

585
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,522
‪我的整个成年生活就是 我不能休息

586
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,857
‪我必须一直工作

587
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,485
‪我必须不停地达到目标 获得成就
‪否则我就什么都不是

588
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,695
‪几年前我还订过婚 因为我想

589
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,781
‪“我得在我死前把婚结了”

590
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,992
‪如果你跟人求婚的话
‪这样说是挺性感的

591
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:42,121
‪我叫它“爱恋的回忆”
‪算是我的套路吧

592
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,628
‪后来跟我前未婚夫没成

593
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:52,715
‪我讨厌现在非得说这个词
‪听起来跟咒语似的 不是吗？

594
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,510
‪就跟“婚婚倒地！”一样
‪听起来太糟了

595
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:58,679
‪我跟他也不再是朋友

596
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,890
‪不是因为他人很糟糕 他还挺好的

597
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,268
‪不知道你们有没有前脚开始跟人约会
‪后脚那人就发现自己是双向情感障碍

598
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:07,355
‪这大概就是上帝
‪“拯救苍生的光辉事业”吧

599
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,276
‪我觉得我是一个很好的伴侣
‪只要不出幺蛾子

600
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,530
‪如果没有什么幺蛾子 我就是最棒的

601
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,116
‪但只要出了一点状况

602
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,700
‪就完全噩梦了

603
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:24,330
‪我就像那些路障道钉
‪铺在你归还租车的路旁

604
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,291
‪只要你还继续往前开
‪就一切顺利 啥事儿没有

605
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:31,379
‪但只要你后退 哪怕一点点
‪我就会刮坏你所有的轮胎

606
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,966
‪然后我还会说：“怎么了？
‪我都已经友情提示了”

607
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,051
‪你会说：“我知道 我是说…

608
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,512
‪我可能做错了一点
‪但你的这反应也太…

609
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,265
‪其他减速路障不是这样反应的”
‪我就会说

610
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,475
‪“那你去跟她过啊？”

611
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,772
‪我前未婚夫跟我不是朋友

612
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,066
‪因为我觉得分手后还在试图当朋友

613
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,067
‪这很怪 这样做的人会说

614
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,904
‪“我们还能一起玩 一起吃冻酸奶”
‪我就：“冻酸奶？

615
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,781
‪我知道你是什么味道

616
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:02,952
‪我才不要跟你出去采样酸奶口味呢
‪你个变态

617
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:07,331
‪他们有跑步后的凯文味吗？
‪某冻酸奶名店里有这款口味吗？”

618
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,543
‪其实有的 就是海盐焦糖味
‪但还是不了吧

619
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,345
‪我取消订婚后 回了家

620
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,599
‪因为不管怎样 假期都是无辜的
‪而且…

621
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,893
‪我的很多朋友都成家安定下来

622
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:30,646
‪其中有一些只是为了成家而成家
‪别的啥也无所谓

623
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,190
‪你们知道这样的伴侣搭配吗？

624
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,816
‪每个人都认识至少一对这样的吧

625
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,277
‪就是这一对里的某个人要远比

626
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,446
‪另一个有趣潇洒得多

627
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:41,199
‪我喜欢称呼这样的组合为
‪外裹巧克力酱的葡萄干

628
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:47,455
‪因为你会觉得 如果你强行要把
‪这俩整一起 也行吧 你开心就好

629
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:53,336
‪但每次你看到它们的时候 你就会想
‪“巧克力 你在干什么？

630
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,838
‪你跟谁在一起不好？

631
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,049
‪你可以跟焦糖在一起
‪跟棉花糖在一起

632
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:02,303
‪你可以跟花生酱在一起
‪我听说它还能治疗抑郁呢

633
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,186
‪但你要跟葡萄干在一起一辈子？

634
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,941
‪我不是故意的 葡萄干 你也很好
‪我们很喜欢你 你是大自然的馈赠

635
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,403
‪但你不觉得你跟燕麦之类的更搭吗？
‪你知道的 对吧？

636
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,821
‪你们这组合感觉不太对

637
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,865
‪对吧 你每天不会担惊受怕吗？

638
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,369
‪怕有人会过来
‪直接把你的巧克力吸走？”

639
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:28,746
‪我喜欢讲这个段子

640
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,539
‪因为我很爱看观众席里的情侣
‪互看对方

641
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,792
‪心想：“我是巧克力还是葡萄干？

642
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,421
‪我们都是巧克力 对吧 亲爱的
‪我们是外裹巧克力的巧克力

643
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,424
‪我们就跟那些锡纸包的
‪瑞士莲巧克力一样

644
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,051
‪我是流心的那部分
‪而你是巧克力外壳

645
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,012
‪因为你好强壮 如果你离开我
‪我就会完蛋”

646
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,776
‪有些人也会想
‪“我就是燕麦怎么了？我感觉挺好”

647
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,573
‪我当时错误地跟我最享受婚姻的
‪一位已婚朋友聊起这事

648
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,701
‪在我取消订婚之后 你们千万别效仿

649
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:11,205
‪享受婚姻的已婚朋友
‪不会记得心碎是什么感觉的

650
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,331
‪她说：“那你现在怎么办？

651
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,458
‪准备重新进入恋爱吗？
‪现在有没对象？”

652
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,253
‪我就说：“不了
‪我现在想多专注发展一下事业”

653
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,170
‪她会说

654
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,424
‪“那你为什么不能
‪同时发展事业和感情呢？”

655
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,093
‪我就想我要怎么解释

656
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:29,390
‪怎么说你才能懂？为什么我不能
‪同时发展事业和感情？

657
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,350
‪你有没有开过高速？

658
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,104
‪路上都是车 忽然你的车道堵了
‪但你旁边的车道还通畅

659
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,022
‪所以你就开到旁边去

660
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,149
‪等你刚完成变道 这条车道也堵住了

661
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,859
‪你原来的车道却通了

662
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,652
‪你又开回去第一个车道
‪因为现在那边不堵

663
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,695
‪等你一开回去

664
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,655
‪你在的车道又堵住了
‪之前的车道又开始通车

665
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,658
‪你就这样来来回回折腾了几回后
‪在某一刻 你忽然意识到

666
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:51,037
‪“是在针对我吗？”

667
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,882
‪她却说：“不确定我有没有理解对

668
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,925
‪通常这种情况下
‪约翰和我会‘嗖’地一下…

669
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,844
‪开到拼车专用道里去”

670
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,393
‪我就：“你家宝宝在哪？
‪我要扔了它！”

671
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,236
‪我其实在订婚取消后

672
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,821
‪挺快就进入了一段新的关系

673
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,656
‪不是我很努力要促成 我真的没有

674
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,618
‪我的很多朋友都告诫我
‪“你应该单身一段时间 冷静下

675
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,371
‪也许养只猫比较好” 坚决不要

676
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:38,167
‪我从来没有在跟猫互动后
‪对自己的过去感到好些

677
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,837
‪每只猫对人的反应
‪就跟我看到我曾经高中同校女生

678
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,589
‪出现在我视野里的反应是一样的

679
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,965
‪就像这样…

680
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:51,430
‪不好！每只猫都这样

681
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,891
‪我可不要回家钻入这样的氛围里

682
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,686
‪但我当时没有刻意要处对象

683
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,231
‪我只是想性感地放纵玩乐一番

684
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,732
‪但通常都不太成功

685
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,359
‪因为我这张正气凛然的大圆脸

686
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,778
‪别人都觉得不长期过日子不行

687
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,740
‪我每次都说：“随便搞一下 都行”
‪男人都会说：“不 我就算了

688
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,826
‪但你可以见见我妈 你想见吗？

689
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,578
‪比起做爱 你看起来更擅长见我妈”

690
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,831
‪他们也没说错

691
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,083
‪我可以跟你妈聊整晚

692
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,709
‪妈妈们总是没理由地喜欢我

693
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,505
‪多年前我跟一个男人交往
‪我们之前有很多问题 感情也不顺利

694
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:26,799
‪我去找他妈妈吃午餐 想问些建议

695
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,801
‪吃到一半的时候
‪她把手放在了我的手上

696
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,512
‪说：“泰勒 我儿子跟他父亲很像

697
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,641
‪如果我能回到过去

698
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:42,398
‪我也不知道会不会
‪再选择跟他父亲结婚”

699
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,409
‪我就：“你现在是要在午餐厅
‪救我一命吗？”

700
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,330
‪就跟电影里
‪一个年长的角色要牺牲自己

701
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,749
‪才能成全剧情一样
‪她仿佛是我的甘道夫

702
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,293
‪她仿佛在说：
‪“快飞走吧 傻孩子！”

703
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:13,888
‪她当母亲和妻子可能不称职
‪但却是一位真心的好友！

704
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,892
‪真的是同性如手足
‪儿子如衣服 对吧？

705
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,186
‪我每天都能想起她

706
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,148
‪我男友当时也没刻意要处对象

707
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,734
‪就是我们见面那会儿
‪直男通常都不会想要处对象

708
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,820
‪女人会为找到一个能带来高潮的男人
‪而感到惊喜

709
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,780
‪而直男们会为碰到一个可以

710
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,575
‪让他们感受到内心真实想法的女孩
‪而感到惊喜

711
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,828
‪姑娘们在乎的是他让我高潮了三次

712
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,372
‪而男人心想：“我是说

713
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,541
‪我就是好喜欢她 老兄

714
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,383
‪我们可以聊一整天
‪我都不会想上她 太不可思议了！

715
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:57,848
‪她就跟我的朋友一样 我不知道
‪如果可以的话 我想舔一舔她的心”

716
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,562
‪直男真的会为他们自己陷入爱情
‪而感到十分骄傲 蛮可爱的

717
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,523
‪他们说完“我爱你” 心里想的是

718
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,734
‪“太棒了 兄弟
‪我就知道你一定能说出口的”

719
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,987
‪姑娘们陷入爱情 说完“我爱你”

720
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,406
‪心里想的是：“又来？你个傻蛋

721
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,578
‪你应该先爱你自己！
‪你总是直接跳过了这部分！

722
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,581
‪明明先是美食 祈祷
‪然后才是恋爱！

723
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:26,085
‪老天 好吧 没事
‪我们一年半之后再试试”

724
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,927
‪我男友比我大七岁

725
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,221
‪因为我需要讲我爸的一些段子
‪所以承前启后一下

726
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,183
‪年长些的男人会更体贴周全

727
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,978
‪人更好些 你从来不需要
‪叫他们去买胃药糖浆

728
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,729
‪因为他们家中常备

729
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,357
‪他们一吃完晚餐就得立刻来一口
‪跟睡前饮料似的

730
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,733
‪“小姑娘 你也要来点吗？”

731
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,569
‪“是的 我也来点 干杯”

732
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,239
‪年长些的男人不会说你
‪“萌”或者“辣”

733
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,492
‪他们会说“光彩照人”“美轮美奂”
‪用的可是多音节的成语呢

734
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,329
‪这些事情 二十几岁的小伙子们
‪还得多花点时间沉淀一下

735
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:07,126
‪老男人们也不是“萌”或“辣”
‪可以形容的 他们是英俊潇洒

736
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,838
‪气质出众 就像那些你不该流连忘返
‪爱不释手的你爷爷年轻时的照片

737
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:18,679
‪你有没有在那种落满灰的老盒子里
‪找到过那样的照片？

738
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:23,309
‪你就想：“这帅哥是谁啊？
‪不 这是不对的 好吧”

739
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,603
‪理论上他们拍照的时候
‪还不算是你的家人

740
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,731
‪他们只是在过去 算是灰色地带

741
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:31,317
‪还有更诡异的

742
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,611
‪你们有没有看过自己父母
‪年轻俊美的照片？

743
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,154
‪你心里会不会有股无名火升起

744
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,699
‪因为你知道当时的他们
‪一定不会跟你约会？

745
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,994
‪我以前看过一张我爸
‪在大学足球队时的照片

746
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,078
‪我三周没跟他讲话

747
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:47,249
‪“你肯定会把我丢在汽车影院
‪就自己撒手跑掉的 你个小美男”

748
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,087
‪我爸疑惑不解
‪我说：“我实在无法给你拥抱了

749
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,547
‪至少一年 而且我不想再聊这事”

750
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,594
‪进入一段新的感情总是挺尴尬的

751
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,679
‪尤其是在刚取消订婚之后

752
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:04,892
‪因为感觉任何俏皮土味情话
‪你都再也说不出口

753
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,478
‪即便你的确想说
‪也会感觉有点像乌鸦嘴

754
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,480
‪所以当新对象跟你说
‪“我想永远和你在一起”

755
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,483
‪你会回：“那可不挺厉害的？

756
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,820
‪那个“永”开头的词
‪我实在用不了了

757
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,783
‪我得稍微再积累下人生信用 但…

758
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:23,452
‪同上 兄弟 肯定的”

759
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:25,913
‪新的感情总是尴尬的

760
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,248
‪因为你得从头到尾告诉这个新人
‪你偏好的“运动”习惯

761
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,625
‪而且你之所以会有偏好的动作

762
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,461
‪是因为之前有人和你如此交互过

763
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,921
‪但你也不能这么说 对吧？

764
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,714
‪你得和跳踢踏舞一样摸索着交涉

765
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,175
‪“亲爱的 你知道这样会挺好玩

766
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,844
‪我怎么从来不知道？

767
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:44,139
‪你的身体给予了我尝试的灵感”

768
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,140
‪但你脑子里想的是：

769
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:51,021
‪“就跟克莱格那样 你就不能
‪像克莱格每次做的那样吗？

770
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,649
‪克莱格破事不会 就会这一件事了

771
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:57,403
‪我们不能直接电话问他吗？
‪能直接打过去问吗？

772
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,947
‪不是什么大事 我们都是成年人

773
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,241
‪还记得我们上个月重置的路由器吗？

774
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,869
‪就跟那个一样 他就是电话那端的
‪掌握着密码的客服

775
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,247
‪这是他现在对我唯一的用处了

776
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:13,293
‪我确实在你的要求下
‪拉黑了他的号码 肯定的

777
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,628
‪但当你拉黑号码的同时

778
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,840
‪你的手机会自动转存那个号码
‪到另一个文件夹里去”

779
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,262
‪看来有人不知道这个功能呢
‪有人要在返程的车上打架了

780
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:27,850
‪床上运动的喜好是一定要沟通的

781
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,936
‪你还得知道什么是能说的
‪什么是不能说的

782
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:34,440
‪这么多年 我一直跟男人说
‪我在床上喜欢粗犷一点

783
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:37,943
‪但我不会这么说
‪我会说：“我受伤了”

784
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,404
‪如果你是个直男 别这么说

785
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:44,450
‪如果一个直男说：“我受伤了”
‪快跑吧 那家伙…

786
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,994
‪那人可能要把你的脚趾装袋子里

787
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:52,541
‪有时候你以为你喜欢一些东西
‪但其实你不喜欢

788
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,418
‪我以为我喜欢对方说下流话 但…

789
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:58,547
‪我只是喜欢听到某些
‪我们之前同意过的下流词组

790
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,549
‪你跟人说过你喜欢听下流话吗？

791
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,925
‪转头那人就在床上说了些不中听的

792
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,637
‪你就想：“这可不行
‪这个词没有得到组织的批准 不行”

793
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,311
‪有次我跟一个男人做爱
‪我在上面 而他忽然说

794
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,521
‪“你看看你！”

795
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:46,386
‪好像我刚学走路那样

796
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:50,057
‪我心想：“你最好去拿录像机 爸爸

797
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,559
‪因为我再也不会上来了”

798
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,856
‪我爸妈不会再来看我的表演了
‪所以别担心

799
00:46:58,774 --> 00:46:59,733
‪没事的 他们不感兴趣

800
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,568
‪没有哪对基督徒父母想看他们女儿

801
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:05,239
‪大聊抑郁和丁丁一个小时
‪这对他们来说不好玩

802
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,327
‪我父母没有那种黑色幽默感

803
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,788
‪而我有 我很高兴自己有 因为…

804
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,082
‪你可以拿你身上发生过的
‪最黑暗的事情当笑料

805
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,335
‪这件事甚至还是现在进行时

806
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,213
‪有时这份幽默还助你度过黑暗 比如

807
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,257
‪又有一个他们不会喜欢的段子了

808
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:29,054
‪你们知道吗？有时候
‪当你拨打自杀求助热线时

809
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,766
‪电话掉线了
‪他们是不会给你打回来的

810
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,187
‪你以为这时一定是
‪按星号键加69 火速回拨

811
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,189
‪有时他们只是在接线隔间里叮地一声

812
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:42,317
‪说：“又掉一个 太好了”

813
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,071
‪你们是不是有些紧张了
‪“难道这真的会发生？” 是的

814
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,199
‪几年前发生过 那真是太好笑了

815
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,410
‪当时我就坐在双树酒店的台阶上

816
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:56,582
‪心想：“这个贱人是想跟我玩消失？
‪在这种我想跟自己玩消失的时候？

817
00:47:56,665 --> 00:48:00,877
‪我已经被‘已读不回’了 但之前
‪还没碰过‘见死不救’ 涨知识了

818
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:02,754
‪真是残忍”

819
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,758
‪我甚至没有很生气 据我所知
‪他们就是这样培训那些接线志愿者的

820
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,510
‪比如：“有些晚上

821
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,888
‪我们这电话量会爆棚

822
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,683
‪周五晚尤其多 在那种情况下…

823
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,935
‪你只能依据自己的判断

824
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:21,023
‪我通常碰到那种享有特权的
‪白人女孩名字 就会先等等

825
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,567
‪比如切尔西、凯尔西、泰勒等

826
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:28,113
‪那些就是我‘放生’的鲑鱼
‪希望他们靠自己游回上游”

827
00:48:31,908 --> 00:48:34,703
‪就算我很生气 那要怎么办？
‪去点评网上打差评吗？

828
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,289
‪“一星差评 真的自杀了

829
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:44,004
‪等着瞧吧 在我写完这条评论后
‪你可能会希望我自杀成功”

830
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,424
‪我几周前在德州讲了这个段子

831
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,594
‪现场有个跟我同龄的白人女孩附和道

832
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,430
‪“而且等待时间也太长了！”

833
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,646
‪她说的没错 好吧？

834
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,981
‪我自己感觉
‪如果你经常拨打他们的电话

835
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,859
‪应该有某种奖励计划

836
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,445
‪就跟航空公司的常飞旅客
‪忠诚度奖励一样

837
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,405
‪自杀求助热线也该设一个

838
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,450
‪等你拨进去 电话里会说：
‪“请输入您的会员积分卡号”

839
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:18,163
‪“欢迎回来 泰勒

840
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,839
‪您的会员等级已达到钻石徽章级
‪感谢您的支持

841
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,425
‪您目前排在第三位 请等待接线

842
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:34,596
‪您想要使用升级特权吗？
‪可以帮您插队 挤掉前面的人”

843
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,109
‪我父母是非常虔诚的基督教徒

844
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,193
‪我爸真的非常虔诚

845
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,780
‪我们小的时候 在外用餐时
‪他也要坚持在晚餐前大声祷告

846
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,866
‪如果你很喜欢 也没事
‪时间不要太长就行

847
00:49:54,950 --> 00:49:59,162
‪但他不是 他的祷告又长
‪又充满了各式私人信息

848
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,248
‪满桌子的人没有一个签过同意书

849
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,376
‪所以有个在公众场合那样的爹
‪让我的青春期真是挺痛苦的

850
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,212
‪“感谢上帝赐予我们食物
‪感谢上帝把我们聚在一起

851
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,548
‪感谢上帝让泰勒从女孩蜕变为女人

852
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,134
‪并且在她需要辅导数学的时候
‪获得了帮助” 我心想

853
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:16,680
‪“你能别向全餐厅的人广播
‪我在流血和我不会做减法的事吗？

854
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,436
‪我觉得上帝知道的”

855
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,354
‪所以我不会对在表演中
‪讲我爸妈的段子

856
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,565
‪感到不好意思
‪因为每次他们只要一抱怨

857
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,234
‪“你就一定要在陌生人面前
‪宣扬家丑吗？”

858
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,738
‪我就会说
‪“好家乡自助餐厅 1998年

859
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:36,616
‪你向半径为五桌区域内的
‪所有人广播了

860
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,202
‪我昨晚拉屎在裤裆上的事情

861
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:43,039
‪我想说什么 就说什么”

862
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,002
‪我现在不教了

863
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:51,840
‪我曾有些朋友在成年后皈依宗教
‪这相当令人不安

864
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:56,720
‪如果你从小的成长环境是信教的
‪你长大后不信了 而你已成年的朋友

865
00:50:56,803 --> 00:51:00,307
‪刚开始信教 这就好像上帝
‪是你的垃圾前男友

866
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,768
‪现在跟你朋友在一起了

867
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,146
‪而你只能在脸书上看着这一切发生

868
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,690
‪他们会说：
‪“你知道上帝吗？他太棒了”

869
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:12,444
‪我就：“是啊 我从小就认识上帝
‪他就是个混蛋 好吗？

870
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,197
‪他是不是告诉你 你是残缺的
‪而你需要他？

871
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,991
‪那就是他的招数 他的套路

872
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,118
‪他跟谁都这么说

873
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,954
‪别喝他给你的水 你一喝
‪下一步你就得…

874
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,833
‪吃他的身体 他的圣灵就在你体内
‪简直就是一整套的陷阱

875
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,920
‪都发生在那个兄弟会现场
‪他们称之为‘教堂’

876
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,757
‪其他还有谁会用罗马数字啊？”

877
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,261
‪这段子听起来好像我非常厌恶
‪我信教的成长背景

878
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:41,056
‪我确实厌恶 所以讲得特生动 但…

879
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:50,273
‪老实说 如果要我想出一些

880
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,400
‪关于我信教成长背景的积极面

881
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,196
‪我觉得我还是可以的
‪只要有足够的时间和钱

882
00:51:56,988 --> 00:52:00,534
‪但这个成长过程的确存在一些问题
‪我也因此有一些严重的信任障碍

883
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,411
‪在教堂的环境里长大 让我变得奇怪

884
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,455
‪好多事情我直到目前为止
‪都还在探索

885
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,625
‪比如 我才知道我自慰的方式是错的

886
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,170
‪我会留点空间来展开说说

887
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,341
‪小时候在教堂环境里长大

888
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,635
‪小孩都会有青少年团契 他们会说：

889
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:21,471
‪“别有性行为”
‪我们都回：“一定不会”

890
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,099
‪他们会接着说：“自慰也不可以”

891
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:28,019
‪女孩子们就会：“好的
‪本来都不知道我们也能自慰”

892
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,063
‪男孩就会反应：“为什么？”

893
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:31,189
‪然后…

894
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,027
‪他们是这样跟我们解释的

895
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,487
‪青少年团契的牧师告诉我们

896
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,533
‪“自慰的这个动作本身并不是罪

897
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,785
‪甚至高潮也不是 其实如果你遗精了

898
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,913
‪要感谢上帝赠予的小礼物
‪今天要过得更开心哦

899
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,917
‪但当你自慰的时候 脑子里想的东西

900
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,423
‪那才是罪孽

901
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,592
‪那就是你内心的贪欲

902
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,344
‪那就是你脑海里的不洁念想

903
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,471
‪那才是罪孽本身”

904
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:08,059
‪所以当我长大后想自慰的时候
‪我就会想：“那…

905
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,687
‪如果我什么也不想

906
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,695
‪我还有可能去天堂 对吧？

907
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,616
‪就是清空想法 快点进去 快速完事

908
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,243
‪回见了耶稣 这样是没问题的吧

909
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,329
‪除了无辜的羔羊 啥也没碰”

910
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,548
‪所以我成年后一直是这样

911
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:42,177
‪朋友们都劝我：“你可以试试冥想”
‪我就：“我觉得我冥想过了”

912
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,096
‪我说成年后 是真的成年之后

913
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,515
‪在我成年之前 完全没有自慰过

914
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,352
‪我就是那么怕下地狱的

915
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:53,897
‪真的 我第一次高潮是和
‪我大学时的男友发生的

916
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,609
‪你知道自己第一次高潮
‪是从别人那里获得的 是有多尴尬

917
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:01,446
‪就像要一个房产中介
‪来向你介绍自己的家

918
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,617
‪“这边是第二间浴室”

919
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,620
‪你心想：“还有第二间浴室？”

920
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,747
‪“你已经在这里住了19年

921
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,457
‪就没想过自己随便逛逛吗？”

922
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,085
‪“我以前试过一次
‪但我怕耶稣会生气

923
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,629
‪其实我不是这房子的业主

924
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,340
‪我也是跟楼上那家伙租的 而且…

925
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,384
‪如果我把地下室淹了 我就拿不回…

926
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:25,136
‪我的租房押金了 所以…

927
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,224
‪你刚好在这 还有什么
‪是可以展示给我看的吗？”

928
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,976
‪她就说：“我带你看看门铃”

929
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,936
‪我就：“这个门铃有这么重要吗？”

930
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:37,023
‪她说“门铃是唯一重要的东西

931
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:43,780
‪不按门铃 谁也不能进来”

932
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,747
‪“但我试过按门铃啊”
‪“那是你没用够力 所以没亮起来”

933
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,087
‪所以我成年后一直是这样自慰的

934
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,214
‪最近跟我一个朋友聊起

935
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:04,467
‪你们有没有大声说出某件事后
‪才意识到根本不该说？

936
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:08,221
‪我在吃早午餐的时候非常随意地提起
‪根本没细想 我就说

937
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,432
‪“当然了 我做的时候啥也没想”

938
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,810
‪她就说：“什么？”
‪还把叉子放了下来

939
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,397
‪“你什么也没想？” 我当时就

940
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,941
‪“不是啦 我肯定也会想点别的”

941
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,401
‪她就问：“你都想些什么？”

942
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:26,156
‪我就：“就那些呗
‪‘快好了 还不错’

943
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,745
‪就那些公路旅行会想的事情 比如…

944
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,706
‪手稳一点 别睡着

945
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,958
‪真希望快点到 到了就能吃东西了

946
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,754
‪得快点了 塔可贝尔快餐要关门了
‪就那些”

947
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,343
‪她就说：“泰勒 这太奇怪了

948
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,430
‪你就不能像正常人那样
‪看看黄片呢？”

949
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,931
‪我就：“我不喜欢看黄片”

950
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,600
‪每次我想尝试的时候 我都会

951
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:57,437
‪“那下面也要脱毛吗？
‪我累了 我好冷”

952
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,149
‪我不是反对看黄片 我不是那种人

953
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,401
‪“如果你看黄片
‪就会毁掉你们的关系”

954
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,819
‪我不是这么想的

955
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,113
‪我曾经约会过一个男人
‪他非常喜欢按摩类的黄片

956
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,574
‪就是按摩师按到最后
‪就跟客户做了的那种

957
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,409
‪意味着有时候我们做爱

958
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,745
‪我还能得到一次按摩！

959
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:23,046
‪这就是一个黄片的正面教学案例

960
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,634
‪但我朋友都吓坏了 她说：“泰勒

961
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,720
‪你这僧侣级别的自慰方式

962
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,389
‪比我看过的所有黄片都要惊悚和怪异

963
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:37,560
‪而且我看过几乎所有的黄片”

964
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,898
‪她还说：“现在网上黄片选择很多

965
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:46,194
‪你就回家上网搜一下
‪‘女性向色情片’ 好吧？

966
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,446
‪你就搜‘女性向色情片’
‪我保证 你一定要试试”

967
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,157
‪所以我回家搜索了“女性向色情片”

968
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,284
‪这样下次早午餐饭局就不会那么尴尬

969
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,085
‪我搜索的时候 出现了好多惊喜

970
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,170
‪输入“女性向色情片”后
‪第一个搜索条

971
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:08,049
‪是一个迪士尼+上所有
‪复仇者联盟电影的链接

972
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,512
‪我个人感觉他们太经常跳来跳去
‪也太多剧情了

973
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,431
‪差不多要跟洛基了
‪忽然又换成了美国队长

974
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,391
‪我得重播了

975
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,352
‪跟我完全不在一个速度和紧张程度上
‪现在还出现了一只浣熊？

976
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:20,979
‪不行

977
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,109
‪“女性向色情片”的第二个搜索条是

978
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,653
‪是一个现实生活中的夫妻

979
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,030
‪上传业余性爱视频的网站 真的

980
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:35,910
‪现充夫妻们就好像
‪“我们好相爱 我们好开心

981
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,998
‪我们觉得可以把
‪我们的做爱过程录下来

982
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:44,419
‪放到网上 供你们这些单身狗享用

983
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:47,172
‪有用吗？你湿了吗？”

984
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,924
‪而你的反应是：
‪“不好意思 湿在了不对的地方

985
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,721
‪但还是恭喜你们
‪你们所拥有的关系感觉非常特别”

986
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,349
‪“女性向色情片”的最后一个搜索条

987
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,394
‪我之前都不知道还有种东西
‪叫做音频色情

988
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,522
‪名副其实 就是没有视频 只有声音

989
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,525
‪理论上也不是色情片演员
‪而是色情片配音员

990
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,903
‪在跟你讲解一个性爱过程

991
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,573
‪就跟播客一样
‪除了不能在开车时听以外

992
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:18,953
‪因为是“女性向” 意味着
‪音频是有故事的 对吧？

993
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,498
‪任何人都能看 没人查

994
00:58:22,457 --> 00:58:26,461
‪他们不会忽然对着麦克风说：
‪“现在射出来了 女人！”

995
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,046
‪他们会让你循序渐进

996
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:33,176
‪我找到的那个有20分钟长

997
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:36,012
‪如果你私信我 我会发给你

998
00:58:38,056 --> 00:58:40,767
‪在刚开始的12分钟里

999
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:47,023
‪故事的发展就是一个男人在安慰你

1000
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:52,529
‪在你刚发生车祸之后 让你冷静下来

1001
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:02,080
‪这就是前戏

1002
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:07,585
‪告诉你们 我爽到了 我…

1003
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:11,381
‪我是说…

1004
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,425
‪我甚至都不需要进入做爱的那部分

1005
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:19,222
‪光是安慰的这部分 他就在说：
‪“没事的 深呼吸 别担心

1006
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:22,559
‪保险公司会负责的”

1007
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:26,521
‪我就：“老天 没错！
‪这就是保险的作用”

1008
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,983
‪当他说到：“我还能做些什么？
‪需要我跪下帮你吗？”

1009
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,903
‪我的想法是：“不了 老兄
‪我买了好事达保险 我没问题的”

I so, so appreciate you guys being here.
It's been a rough couple of years.

11
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,611
I got bangs at one point.

12
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,072
-Shit got dark.
-[audience laughs]

13
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,908
I didn't even want bangs.
I just needed people to check on me.

14
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,785
And it works, by the way.

15
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:18,244
You post a selfie in bangs,

16
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,706
everybody's like, "Fire emoji.
You go, girl!" Then they text you, like,

17
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,874
"You okay?"

18
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:24,125
[audience laughs]

19
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,753
Here's what I did. I got bangs

20
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,088
and then two days later,

21
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,716
-I did mushrooms for the first time.
-[audience laughs]

22
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,760
And as soon as I did those mushrooms,

23
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:37,388
I was like, "I should've done these first.

24
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,057
[audience laughs]

25
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,811
Probably wouldn't have gotten these bangs
if I forgave myself, huh?"

00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,145
[audience laughs]

27
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:47,899
But you know what? Having bangs
feels exactly like being on mushrooms.

28
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,944
The whole time, you're just looking
at your friends, like, "Do I look weird?

29
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,195
[audience laughs]

30
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,906
You guys would tell me
if I looked weird, right? Is it…

31
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,783
Is it bad different? Is it not good--

32
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,077
You know what? I changed my mind.
I don't want to do it.

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,453
It's too late? It's already happening?

34
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,497
Okay, no, I can be this person."

35
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,460
I got back into therapy.
Anybody in therapy?

36
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,004
[audience cheers]

37
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,382
Mostly women. That's the problem.

38
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:14,008
[audience laughs]

39
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:16,594
It's very hard to stay in therapy.

40
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,847
My old therapist told me
that when I get close to people,

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,431
I have a tendency to self-sabotage.

42
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,392
And I thought that was bullshit,

43
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:23,893
so I ghosted her.

44
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,687
-[audience laughs]
-And then…

45
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,190
I finally went back
because I finally dated enough people

46
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:33,486
who all gave me the exact same feedback
about my shitty personality.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,780
You know, that romantic quota you hit
where you're, like,

48
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:39,325
-[laughing] "Uh-oh! Might be me!
-[audience laughs]

49
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,787
Oh, the reviews are in and they are
[blows raspberry] unanimous.

50
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:43,913
That's a bummer."

51
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,832
So after a really bad breakup
a few years ago,

52
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,834
I finally took a long hard look at myself

53
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:52,213
and said, "Okay, Taylor, five out of five
dudes all think that in fights,

54
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,300
you behave like a raccoon
trapped in a trash bag."

55
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:59,178
[audience laughs]

56
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,140
"So maybe it's time to get some Klonopin

57
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,434
or a rabies shot."

58
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,394
[audience laughs]

59
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,104
I am fully medicated now.

60
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:10,106
Anybody else? Anti-depressants?

61
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:12,650
-[audience cheers]
-Medication? Yeah.

62
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:14,402
Nice. What are we on? Shout it out.

63
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,487
[audience shouting indistinctly]

64
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,324
Zoloft, Lexapro. Oh!

65
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,119
-Look at us. Gang's all here!
-[audience laughs]

66
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,538
Oh my God! I'm also on something.

67
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,583
I would never say what,
that's very personal, but…

68
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,668
[audience laughs]

69
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,128
No, I'm kidding. I'm on a few things.

70
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,923
I am on Klonopin as needed
for panic attacks.

71
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,717
I'm so glad I have Klonopin now
because before

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,053
I had medication for it,
I would have panic attacks

73
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,638
right when I had to be somewhere,

74
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:44,515
which is the worst time to get them
'cause then you just have to pinch

75
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,019
the panic attack off
like a shit you don't have time to take.

76
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,771
[audience laughs]

77
00:03:49,854 --> 00:03:51,522
You know what I mean?
When you're, like, "Okay,

78
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,858
I got 60% of that out of my system.

79
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,568
[audience laughs]

80
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:58,529
-I'm not done but I gotta go to work.
-[audience laughs]

81
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,406
I will get to the other 40 later

82
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:03,201
or I'll finish in the big stall at lunch
if no one's in there.

83
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:07,038
[audience laughs]

84
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,290
I got put on something else for sleep

85
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:12,794
because I have night terrors.
There's no fun, casual way to say that.

86
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,673
-[giggles] "Wake up screaming and…"
-[audience laughs]

87
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,758
These sleeper time pills I got are great.

88
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,134
They don't stop the nightmares

89
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,887
but they do hold you down
while they're happening.

90
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,472
[audience laughs]

91
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:26,432
Which sounds bad but before,

92
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,643
I'd wake up in the middle so afraid

93
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,561
and now, I stay asleep

94
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:34,691
-until the nightmare's natural conclusion,
-[audience laughs]

95
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,694
-which provides you with some closure.
-[audience laughs]

96
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,488
-You're like, "Oh, he stabs me at the end.
-[audience gasps]

97
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,367
Okay, plot twist, M. Nightmare Shyamalan."

98
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,868
[audience laughs]

99
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,455
I thought I was on an anti-depressant.

100
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,623
It turns out I'm not.

101
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:53,042
It turns out I'm actually
on a mood stabilizer

102
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,378
that they use as an anti-depressant.

103
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:57,296
Fun fact about prescription drugs.

104
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:00,675
Everything they prescribe, they actually
use for, like, four different things.

105
00:05:00,758 --> 00:05:04,470
So you don't really know what your deal is

106
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,806
until you find a combo that works

107
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,142
and then Google all your pills
by yourself.

108
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,601
[audience laughs]

109
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:13,021
So after years of trial and error,

110
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,398
I finally found a combination of things
that worked for me,

111
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,401
and six months ago, I decided to Google it
'cause what the hell.

112
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,528
And it turns out
that everything I'm taking

113
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,198
is primarily used for bipolar disorder.

114
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:27,994
So I went back to my psychiatrist
and I was, like, "Hey.

115
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,496
[audience laughs]

116
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,290
Do we think…?"

117
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:35,501
[audience laughs]

118
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:38,254
And she was, like, "Oh! Yeah!"

119
00:05:38,337 --> 00:05:43,134
[audience laughs]

120
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:50,892
And I was, like,
"Is this how you fucking tell people?"

121
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,226
[audience laughs]

122
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,063
And she's, like, "No, of course not.
We didn't know.

123
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,355
I'm glad we figured it out."

124
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,609
-And I was, like, "We?"
-[audience laughs]

125
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,278
I said, "You really didn't know
that I was bipolar?" And she goes,

126
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:04,947
"No, of course not. We thought
we were treating anxiety and depression."

127
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,617
And I said, "Okay.
'Cause this kinda feels like

128
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,953
a putting your dog's medication
in cheese situation."

129
00:06:11,037 --> 00:06:14,290
[audience laughs]

130
00:06:16,375 --> 00:06:19,587
And I was, like, "I don't know how I feel
about this diagnosis." And she goes,

131
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,131
"Well, if it makes you feel better,
you don't have to say,

132
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,635
'I am bipolar.'
You can say, 'I have bipolar.'"

133
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,470
-[audience chuckles]
-Which feels a lot like someone going,

134
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,389
"I said you were being a bitch."

135
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,643
[audience laughs]

136
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,068
I'm so glad I know that I'm bipolar now.

137
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:45,196
I mean, I have the right meds,
I got a mood ring, I'm handling it.

138
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,906
[audience laughs]

139
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,742
But when I first found out,
it was a very tough pill to swallow.

140
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,953
-And I've swallowed a lot of pills.
-[audience laughs]

141
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:53,955
Because when you first find out
something like that,

142
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:57,041
you're, like, "Oh man,
am I gonna tell anybody?

143
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,001
Should I tell anybody?

144
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:01,337
And if I do tell people,

145
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,631
am I hot

146
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:08,010
and/or talented enough
to be an inspiration?"

147
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,389
[audience laughs]

148
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:14,892
[audience claps, cheers]

149
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:18,438
Like, if I have a thing
and someone else has that thing

150
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,356
and they find out I have it too,

151
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,068
are they gonna feel good or bad
with that information?

152
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,487
Because when I got diagnosed,
they started listing names.

153
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:28,698
They were, like,
"You know who else is bipolar?

154
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,450
Selena Gomez."

155
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,409
And I was, like,

156
00:07:31,492 --> 00:07:34,370
-"That does make me feel better.
-[audience laughs]

157
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,748
-She is very pretty.
-[audience laughs]

158
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,542
Okay, I'll be bipolar."

159
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,335
[audience laughs]

160
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:42,587
I did not grow up

161
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,214
in a household that was very, like,
mental health-conscious.

162
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,382
Like, we were very religious.

163
00:07:46,465 --> 00:07:50,094
I don't know if you've ever tried
to tell your conservative dad

164
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:53,264
that you have a mental health issue.
It doesn't go great.

165
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:56,100
When I was in high school,
I was like, "Dad, I think I'm depressed."

166
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:59,353
And he was, like, "You just need some
protein. Get a scoop of peanut butter."

167
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,897
[audience laughs]

168
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:05,276
Yeah, there's a lot of dads out there just
white-knuckling it through life right now,

169
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:09,447
clinging to a jar of chunky Jif
like it's the answer,

170
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,908
just a buoy in the storm.

171
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,620
-"It'll pass!"
-[audience laughs]

172
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:19,790
The only mental health advice
my dad ever gave me

173
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:21,584
is I was having panic attacks
in high school

174
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,003
and I didn't know what they were
and I was very stressed out.

175
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:24,962
And I was, like, "I don't know what to do.

176
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,131
I don't know what to do when I feel
like this. I don't know what to do."

177
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,425
And he goes, "Alright.

178
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:34,972
All I can tell you
is that when you feel like this,

179
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:40,311
get as far away from the people
you care about as possible…

180
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,063
[audience laughs]

181
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,816
until you feel different."

182
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,570
Which is advice you give a werewolf, like…

183
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,614
[audience laughs]

184
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:55,326
"Just run into the woods
'til you're not a monster anymore.

185
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:59,497
Don't let them see you change. They won't
accept you for what you truly are."

186
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,831
[audience laughs]

187
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,336
And I had friends who scared me too
when I was trying to get on medication.

188
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:07,630
They were, like, "Ugh, I tried.
I tried anti-depressants.

189
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,258
I didn't like how I felt on them.
I didn't feel like myself."

190
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,469
And now that I'm on them, I'm, like,
"Yeah, me neither! It's the best."

191
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,596
[audience laughs]

192
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,140
Okay? And I do feel like myself.

193
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:20,685
I just feel like now someone's
sitting on me going,

194
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,728
-"Shh!
-[audience laughs]

195
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:26,107
Stop talking. You will ruin everything.
We are…

196
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,441
We are trying to help you.

197
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,944
You'd be married right now
if you just shut the hell up.

198
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,070
[audience laughs]

199
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,657
Remember that? Yeah, us too.
We are trying to help you. Go to sleep.

200
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,576
Choose a different adventure."

201
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:40,288
[audience laughs]

202
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:45,084
And they warn you about the side effects
when you get on medication.

203
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:47,420
They go, "You know,
your sex drive might go down."

204
00:09:47,503 --> 00:09:50,715
And I'll be honest, I have experienced
that since I got on medication,

205
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,218
but I can't tell if my sex drive is lower

206
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,805
-or if my self-esteem is just higher now.
-[audience laughs]

207
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:58,973
You know?

208
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,851
[audience claps, cheers]

209
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:06,897
It's, like, am I not in the mood, or do I
just not need the validation? Which is it?

210
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,317
Because depression
will bring you to your knees

211
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,361
and you're, like, "While I'm down here,
might as well make someone feel good.

212
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:17,658
-I… do not want to waste a trip."
-[audience whoops]

213
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,369
If you're not laughing,
congrats on your serotonin.

214
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,580
[audience laughs]

215
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:25,875
And if you're, like, "What's serotonin?"
Don't worry. You have enough.

216
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:28,252
[audience laughs]

217
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,509
I wasn't sure
if I was gonna talk about it on stage,

218
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,429
and then I needed new material and I was,
like, "Fire sale! Everything goes."

219
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,223
[audience laughs]

220
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,768
No, truthfully, I was surprised

221
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,437
that I felt so bad about it
'cause I think I'm pretty open-minded.

222
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,689
And I don't think anybody should feel bad

223
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,358
if they get diagnosed
with a mental illness

224
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,360
'cause it's just information about you

225
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,820
that helps you know
how to take better care of yourself.

226
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:57,698
-[audience cheers]
-Yeah.

227
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,450
Being bipolar,
there's nothing wrong with it.

228
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,577
Being bipolar
is like not knowing how to swim.

229
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,953
It might be embarrassing to tell people

230
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,331
and it might be hard
to take you certain places.

231
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,249
[audience laughs]

232
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,795
[audience continues laughing]

233
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,964
But they have arm floaties.

234
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,050
[audience laughs]

235
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:19,220
And if you just take your arm floaties,

236
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,264
you can go wherever the hell you want.

237
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,724
[audience laughs]

238
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,811
And… I know some of you are, like,
"But Taylor,

239
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,687
what if people judge me
for taking arm floaties?"

240
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,898
Well, those people don't care
if you live or die,

241
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,691
-so maybe who cares?
-[audience whoops]

242
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:35,528
Maybe fuck those people a little.

243
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,780
-[audience cheers]
-I don't know.

244
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,622
That being said,
you have to take your arm floaties

245
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,748
[audience laughs]

246
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:50,042
because it's not cool
to know you can't swim,

247
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:51,085
go to the public pool anyway,

248
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,879
and jump into the deep end,
making it everyone else's problem.

249
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,423
[audience laughs]

250
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:59,301
And you thrash around going, "I'm good!"
They're like, "You're literally drowning."

251
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:01,804
And then someone nice
and handsome jumps in to help you.

252
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,639
And you're, like,
"See? I'm fine. I can totally swim."

253
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:07,184
And they're, like,
"No, you're holding him underwater.

254
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,394
[audience laughs]

255
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:11,856
-You turned Kevin into an arm floaty
-[audience laughs]

256
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,484
and that's not a fair relationship
for Kevin."

257
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,236
[audience laughs]

258
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:19,363
Then someone floats by you on their back

259
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,614
and you're, like, "What was that?"

260
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:24,076
And they're, like, "Oh, that's someone
whose parents supported them in the pool…

261
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,955
[audience laughs]

262
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,541
until they could be trusted not to die.

263
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,667
[audience laughs]

264
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,670
-Here are your arm floaties."
-[audience laughs]

265
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:37,339
I was very nervous to tell friends of mine

266
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,842
I was bipolar because I thought
they would think of me differently.

267
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,094
And then I told all my friends
and nobody did

268
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,180
and it was actually pretty insulting.

269
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,765
[audience laughs]

270
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,893
Because I've had friends tell me
they were bipolar

271
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,270
and I was, like,
"What? You? You're kidding."

272
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,897
And then I told my friends and they
were, like,

273
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,774
-"That checks out. That's…
-[audience laughs]

274
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,568
That connects a lot of dots for us."

275
00:12:57,651 --> 00:13:00,154
I told Dustin, one of my best friends
in the whole world,

276
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,741
and he goes, "Yeah, your mental illness
was kinda like your middle name.

277
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,411
I didn't know what it was
but I knew that you had one."

278
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,290
[audience laughs]

279
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:16,086
It's really good.

280
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,257
That was not the feedback I kept getting
from romantic partners, by the way.

281
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,677
-[audience laughs]
-That's not what finally made me get help.

282
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,764
Every guy I've ever dated
has told me I have trust issues,

283
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:29,683
which is something liars say
when you're on to them.

284
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,520
[audience laughs]

285
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,564
[in deep voice]
"You have trust issues, babe."

286
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:38,317
You have
a hot co-worker and a locked phone, so…

287
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,278
[audience laughs]

288
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:46,075
I have trust issues
but I earned them, okay?

289
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,993
-[audience laughs]
-I absolutely earned them, like,

290
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,704
I got cheated on in college.
My college boyfriend

291
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,873
was sleeping with sex workers
behind my back,

292
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:57,044
or prostitutes if you're old and don't
know that word's not okay to use anymore.

293
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,713
Sometimes older crowd members
could get confused 'cause they're, like,

294
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,423
"What is a sex worker?"

295
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:04,093
"Is that what my granddaughter
does on Instagram?"

296
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:05,344
-[audience laughs]
-And you're, like, "No, no, no,

297
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,304
she's just hot. That's a FabFitFun box."

298
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:09,348
-"That's a different…"
-[audience laughs]

299
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,268
-"That's a different thing."
-[audience laughs]

300
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,479
"Your granddaughter doesn't…
That's not a job."

301
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,273
-"That's not real."
-[audience laughs]

302
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,567
You can't say prostitute anymore.

303
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,611
Calling a sex worker a prostitute
is like calling a comedian a clown.

304
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,781
You're not technically wrong
but you are a fucking asshole, so…

305
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,200
[audience laughs]

306
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,703
But I told my therapist
I got cheated on like this

307
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,663
and she didn't say
what I wanted her to say,

308
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,082
which was, "Poor baby, sweetie,
this session is free."

309
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,334
[audience laughs]

310
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:41,589
Instead, she goes, "Well, you might be
a self-fulfilling prophecy."

311
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:45,050
And I was like, "Oh!" And she's like,
"No, it's a bad thing." And I was like,

312
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:46,552
[audience laughs]

313
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,723
"Well, then could you say
I have self-fulfilling prophecy?

314
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,391
[audience laughs]

315
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,227
Is Selena Gomez
a self-fulfilling prophecy?"

316
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:58,022
[audience laughs]

317
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,316
And I said, "What does that mean,
I'm a self-fulfilling prophecy?"

318
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,278
And she goes, "Well, sometimes
we expect someone to treat us poorly,

319
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,781
so we treat them like they're going
to treat us poorly until they do."

320
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,241
"You thought someone
was gonna cheat on you,

321
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,535
so you treated them like
they were gonna cheat on you

322
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:15,289
until they did cheat on you,
and then you were like, 'See?'"

323
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,333
[audience chuckles]

324
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:21,128
-And I was like, "Oh."
-[audience laughs]

325
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,380
"So I'm a witch."

326
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,299
[audience laughs]

327
00:15:25,382 --> 00:15:29,011
[audience claps, cheers]

328
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:33,390
And she's like,
"Oh! So close. You're a bitch."

329
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:35,059
-"You gotta…"

330
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,729
I'm like,
"Whatever. All I heard was Gryffindor!"

331
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:42,983
[audience laughs]

332
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,361
I am working on my trust issues.

333
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,488
I was so much worse when I first started
seeing my therapist.

334
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:49,365
I told her like first session, I was like,

335
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,369
"The guy I'm dating keeps answering
my phone calls, 'Hey, beautiful?'"

336
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:54,411
[audience laughs]

337
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:57,998
And she's like, "So, what's the problem?"
I was like, "I mean, I don't know yet."

338
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,376
[audience laughs]

339
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:04,463
-"But when I find out who 'Beautiful' is…"
-[audience laughs]

340
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,256
She's like,
"Do you think it might be you?"

341
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,759
I was like, "I'm sorry.
I thought we were here to work."

342
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,386
[audience laughs]

343
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,554
I think I'm cute or whatever now,

344
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,515
but I was an ugly kid with honest parents,

345
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:17,977
and that shit stays in your bones,
alright?

346
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,978
If you were an ugly kid
with honest parents,

347
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:22,398
I don't care how attractive
you grow up to be,

348
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,150
at any point, if someone's like,
"You look really nice today," you're like,

349
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,778
"Yeah, whatever.
I know the Goddamn truth."

350
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,530
[audience laughs]

351
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:32,616
When I was ten, I said,
"Dad, am I pretty?"

352
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,993
And his response was, "Look."

353
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,830
[audience laughs]

354
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,499
"I'm not the best looking guy, right?"

355
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:43,669
"No, but I wake up
every morning and I try."

356
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,920
-[audience laughs]
-"I…"

357
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:47,339
"I take a shower, I put on a nice suit,

358
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:48,882
and I do okay!"

359
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,551
[audience whoops]

360
00:16:50,634 --> 00:16:53,178
-And then he went to work.
-[audience laughs]

361
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,848
-And I became a comedian, I guess.
-[audience laughs]

362
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:58,726
That was his response
to his ten-year-old daughter.

363
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:02,730
Just like, "You and me, potato face,
these were the cards we were dealt."

364
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,106
"Get clean and match."

365
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:07,693
"That's all you can do.
Don't sleep on wet hair. Can't do that."

366
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,195
"Maybe wear a hat sometimes.
Cover up some of that head."

367
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:11,905
"I'm sorry there's so much of it."

368
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,532
[audience laughs]

369
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,826
I think I'm pretty. I have a big head.

370
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,413
I know I do 'cause every guy I've ever
dated has made a point to be like,

371
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:23,125
-"I love your big head."
-[audience laughs]

372
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,501
That's my favorite thing guys do

373
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,046
when they compliment the thing
you hate most about yourself,

374
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:29,465
they're like, "I love your soft arms."

375
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:32,009
-You're like, "Okay.
-[audience laughs]

376
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,178
Yeah? I love your weird balls.

377
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,930
-How does it feel?
-[audience laughs]

378
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:39,850
[audience cheers]

379
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:43,103
-How does it feel to be accepted?"
-[audience chuckles]

380
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,898
-I'm a nightmare to date.
-[audience laughs]

381
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,442
Anything nice you do or say,
I'm just like, "Whatever."

382
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:52,571
I dated a guy once who told me that
flirting with me was like punching water.

383
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,947
[audience laughs]

384
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,033
And I was like,
"Why? 'Cause it's pointless

385
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:58,327
or 'cause you look stupid doing it?"

386
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,828
[audience laughs]

387
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,038
He's like, "Did you hear it?"

388
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:03,457
-I'm like, "I heard it that time. Yeah."
-[audience laughs]

389
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,711
And then he cheated on me,
so, you know, prophecy fulfilled!

390
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,214
[audience laughs]

391
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,925
I can't help it. At the beginning
of a relationship with a guy,

392
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,677
I just assume anything nice he does

393
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:18,639
is he a move he pulls on everybody

394
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:23,185
and I'm not gonna fall
for your choreography, sir.

395
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,562
-[audience laughs]
-I'm like, "Oh, is this…

396
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:27,689
is this your move?

397
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,234
-You open the car door for me on the date?
-[woman laughs]

398
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,027
Is this like your move?

399
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,738
[chuckles] This is how you do it?

400
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:36,949
That's cute. Bet that works a lot."

401
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,827
[audience laughs]

402
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:42,454
"Oh, is this… is this your move?

403
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:44,164
You go with me to my grandpa's funeral,

404
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,874
hold an umbrella over my head in the rain?

405
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,627
-[audience laughs]
-Is this like… Is this like your move?

406
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,338
-This is how you do it?
-[audience laughs]

407
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:55,175
Like, 'Whoops, don't get wet.'
'Oops! I am.' Whatever.

408
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:59,805
[audience laughs, cheers]

409
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,727
This ain't my first rodeo.
I used to have two grandpas."

410
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,729
[audience laughs]

411
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,902
[audience chuckles]

412
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,320
"Oh, is this…

413
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,240
-Is this your move?
-[audience chuckles]

414
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,075
You die next to me in a hospital bed

415
00:19:20,158 --> 00:19:23,328
at 86 years old holding my hand
for all eternity?

416
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,123
Is this like your move?
This is how you get pussy?"

417
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,416
[audience laughs]

418
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:29,668
He's like,
"We've been together for 60 years."

419
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:32,087
I'm like, "You're a fuckboy and I know it!

420
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,547
[audience laughs]

421
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,426
Don't bury me with this guy. He's been
dying with other people behind my back.

422
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,219
-[audience laughs]
-I can't prove it.

423
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,555
Check his phone when he uses the bedpan."

424
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,099
[audience laughs]

425
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,854
-And that's why we're in therapy.
-[audience laughs]

426
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,147
People are scared to go to therapy

427
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,983
because they think it's someone
sitting in a chair going, "You suck."

428
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:56,236
But it's not. It's you in a chair going,
"I suck."

429
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,279
[audience laughs]

430
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,490
And then your therapist is like,
"That's great. Let's start there."

431
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:01,742
[audience laughs]

432
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:04,703
Therapy just helps you to get
to the bottom of why you're trash, okay?

433
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:05,829
You go into therapy and you're like,

434
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,831
"Here's all the stuff
that sucks about me."

435
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,708
And she goes, "Okay."
And she puts it all up on the wall

436
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,251
like you're solving a crime together.

437
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,336
-Fun!
-[audience laughs]

438
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:15,380
And then she gets some of that red string
that detectives use at home

439
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,799
when they've been thrown off the case
for going rogue

440
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:18,967
[audience laughs]

441
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:22,262
and she starts connecting
each crappy thing about you

442
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,974
to each one
of your corresponding childhood traumas,

443
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,810
and you're like, "Oh my God!
That's why I'm like this."

444
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,562
And she's like,
"That's why you're like this."

445
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,689
And you're like, "Am I fixed now?"

446
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,359
-And she's like, "God, no!
-[audience laughs]

447
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,569
No, no, no."
You're like, "Well, what do I do now?"

448
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,821
She's like, "Well, you keep coming back
in here every week

449
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:44,117
with your credit card." And you're like,
"What? Will I ever be fixed?"

450
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:46,370
She's like, "I don't know.
Bring your credit card!"

451
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:49,122
[audience laughs]

452
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,168
I've got to the bottom
of a lot of stuff in therapy.

453
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:56,922
I'm an emotional eater. I don't know
if anybody else identifies with that.

454
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,049
-[audience whoops]
-Cool. Seven people.

455
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,385
Everyone else is like, "No, we just eat
until we're almost full

456
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,762
and then we thank God
for the opportunity, okay."

457
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,097
[audience laughs]

458
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,932
"Food is just fuel for me."

459
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,184
If you're one of those,
fuck right off, for real.

460
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,228
-[audience laughs]
-I'll refund your money.

461
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,188
-I don't need your support.
-[audience cheers]

462
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,107
I'm doing fine.

463
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,235
If you don't know
what an emotional eater is,

464
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:20,737
it just means you like eat
to cope with uncomfortable feelings.

465
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,906
So if I'm like sad or anxious or awake,

466
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,409
-I like to be eating to take the edge off.
-[audience laughs]

467
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,285
If you still don't know if that's you,

468
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,121
you can ask yourself a few questions
to find out.

469
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,665
Number one. When you eat nachos in public,

470
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,876
do you get kinda mad
that other people are there to see it?

471
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,421
[audience laughs]

472
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:40,549
Do you feel like nachos
should come with a privacy curtain? I do.

473
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:44,011
[audience laughs]

474
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,680
Have all the best meals of your life

475
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:50,017
taken place in your own car
around 11 p.m.?

476
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:53,145
-[audience laughs]
-Under a flickering streetlamp?

477
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,442
Have you ever eaten a brownie

478
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,193
while you felt okay

479
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,987
[audience laughs]

480
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:04,322
and wished you were sad

481
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,033
[audience laughs]

482
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,076
so that it tasted better?

483
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,245
[audience laughs]

484
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,372
Sounds like more than seven of us.

485
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,292
[audience laughs]

486
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:19,254
In therapy,
I figured out the day in my childhood

487
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,422
I became an emotional eater.

488
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,966
I was eight years old
and I was eating a bagel in the kitchen

489
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,301
and my dad came in and he goes,

490
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,554
"You're gonna want to put that bagel down.
I gotta tell you something."

491
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,390
And that's when he told me
that my mom had died.

492
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:34,436
So somewhere in my brain,
something clicked, like,

493
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:39,274
"Oh, when you stop eating bread,

494
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,359
[audience laughs]

495
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,029
-people perish."
-[audience laughs]

496
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:46,490
I went back to fourth grade
like the angel of death.

497
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,950
Everyone's like, "Step on a crack,
break your mother's back."

498
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,537
I'm like, "Stop eating bread,
now your mom's dead, dude.

499
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,538
[audience laughs]

500
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:56,416
They left out that second part but…"

501
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,629
I had a lisp when I was eight. I tell
you guys that because no one told me.

502
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,963
[audience laughs]

503
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,966
They pulled me aside
a year later at school.

504
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,967
Someone's like,

505
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,220
"Taylor, your teacher thinks you might be
struggling with a speech impediment."

506
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:10,263
I'm like,
[with lisp] "What's a speech impediment?

507
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:11,431
[audience laughs]

508
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,142
[with lisp] Are you sure
you have the right person, 'cause…

509
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,520
-I'm crushing it out there."
-[audience laughs]

510
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:17,771
And they're like,
"You didn't do anything wrong.

511
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,648
You just pronounce
your words a little differently,

512
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:21,608
like you say "sh" instead of "ss"
for your S's,

513
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:23,944
does that make sense? And I was like,

514
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:27,823
[with lisp]
"I'm pretty sure I would have noticed

515
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,410
-[audience laughs]
-if I said 'sh' instead of 'sh'.

516
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,830
-Hope you find who you're looking for.
-[audience laughs]

517
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,541
If you have any follow-up questions,
I'll be on the see-saw."

518
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:39,209
[audience laughs]

519
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:46,883
I know dead mom jokes
make people uncomfortable.

520
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,344
I know that and if you are uncomfortable,

521
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:52,722
I don't know what to say, you should've
worked harder so it was you up here.

522
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:56,977
[audience laughs, cheers]

523
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:05,068
No, honestly, I never want to make people
feel uncomfortable with that information.

524
00:24:05,152 --> 00:24:07,195
So much so
that I used to lie to everybody.

525
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,948
Growing up, I used to tell everybody
that my parents were separated

526
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,616
so I wouldn't have to say my mom's dead.

527
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,577
And that worked very well

528
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,038
until recently a friend of mine found out
I had lied and she was very upset.

529
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,083
-[audience laughs]
-She was like, "Your mom's dead?

530
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,460
Taylor, you told me your parents
were separated."

531
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,671
And I was like, "Well, they were!

532
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,715
[audience laughs]

533
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,717
By Jesus."

534
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,595
[audience laughs]

535
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:35,765
Both her parents are alive, so she has
no idea how funny that is but…

536
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,018
-[audience laughs]
-She'll get it eventually, right?

537
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,896
-Like that joke is a slow burn.
-[audience laughs]

538
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:44,941
Kinda like cancer,
which is what got mine, hey oh!

539
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:46,067
[audience laughs]

540
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,194
Okay, alright.

541
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:49,112
[audience laughs]

542
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:51,281
[groans] Here's the deal, Boston.

543
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,074
[audience laughs]

544
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,953
We have another, like,
six minutes of dead mom jokes.

545
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,705
[audience laughs]

546
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,751
I know. You're getting like, "Whoa, no,
six minutes is a long time."

547
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,253
It won't feel long.
I have cushioned her, alright?

548
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:07,130
-[audience laughs]
-I have laid my dead mom to rest

549
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,051
in a beautiful casket of dick jokes
and pop culture references.

550
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:13,637
There's something for everybody
over the next six minutes.

551
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,223
You'll laugh, you'll cry,
you'll forget she's dead.

552
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:17,682
[audience laughs]

553
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:20,393
But I know a lot's happening
for you as a crowd right now

554
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,978
because you're like,
"Taylor, we're good people.

555
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,814
Good people wouldn't laugh at dead
mom jokes."

556
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:28,485
I'm here to tell you that if you're trying
to be a good person at a comedy show,

557
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,947
-you're wasting your God damn time.
-[audience laughs]

558
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,032
Trying to be a good person
at a comedy show

559
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,243
is like trying to recycle at a theme park.

560
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,579
You're already in here and part of the
problem, put your hands up and have fun.

561
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:41,498
[audience laughs]

562
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,292
And I know you're good people.
You're like,

563
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,044
"Taylor, we've known you for 25 minutes.

564
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,922
We hate that anything bad
ever happened to you even once."

565
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:50,715
Thank you so much, Boston.

566
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,760
But what you have to understand is
the bad thing already happened

567
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,096
and now I'm talking about it
into a microphone

568
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,307
-in front of people who paid to be here,
-[audience laughs]

569
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,894
which means now the bad thing is money.

570
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,437
[audience laughs]

571
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,815
Do you think I'd be this successful

572
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:11,152
at my age if I had a live mom?

573
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,446
[audience laughs]

574
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,701
[audience whoops]

575
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,622
-[shouts] Fuck no!
-[audience laughs]

576
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,667
I'd be a creative writing teacher
who loved myself

577
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,503
and I'd be sitting in the dark
with you pheasants, okay?

578
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:31,298
-[audience laughs]
-She's in heaven, I'm on Netflix,

579
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,216
it all worked out.

580
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,053
[audience cheers]

581
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,520
That is a real thing I said in therapy.

582
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:46,813
[audience laughs]

583
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,606
To which my therapist responded,

584
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:50,358
"You should come in twice this week."

585
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:53,278
[audience laughs]

586
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,326
Some people get sad
because I was eight when it happened.

587
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,286
But eight is a great time to lose a parent

588
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:04,372
because you're so stupid,
you barely know what's going on.

589
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,874
When I was eight, I was like,

590
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,543
the only people I know with dead moms
are Disney princesses.

591
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,669
[audience chuckles]

592
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:13,465
So like, this sucks
but am I about to get hot?

593
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,674
[audience laughs]

594
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,217
Then I hit puberty and I was like,

595
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,887
"Oh no, I guess God just hates me
right now, that's a bummer."

596
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,183
That's a joke. God doesn't hate anybody,
alright? Not anymore.

597
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,352
[audience laughs]

598
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:28,646
But have you read the Old Testament?
Holy shit.

599
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,981
[audience laughs]

600
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:33,485
The Old Testament is my favorite
Taylor Swift album.

601
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,528
-It is…
-[audience laughs]

602
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,992
It is banger after banger. Just like,

603
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,744
"You don't believe in me?

604
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,955
[in singsong voice]
Snakes! Look what you made me do."

605
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,249
[audience laughs]

606
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:51,336
I'm a 20-something white woman, obviously,

607
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:53,630
I'm gonna compare T. Swift to the Lord,
alright?

608
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:54,756
[audience laughs]

609
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,801
She is the only god I still believe in,
alright?

610
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,552
[audience cheers]

611
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,181
I don't see God God revamping his old shit

612
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:07,394
and let's be honest, he probably should
'cause the people who own it now suck.

613
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,979
[audience laughs, cheers]

614
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:17,570
It does grow you up very quickly,
losing a parent that young.

615
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:21,866
I mean, I saw a dead body when I was eight
which means I saw a dead body years

616
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,201
before I saw a dick.

617
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,995
And that is not the order
that shit should go in

618
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,832
-[audience laughs]
-according to the American Girl Body book.

619
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:31,376
[audience laughs]

620
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,505
Although maybe it should be
'cause you know what's crazy? A dick?

621
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,841
-Way more traumatizing than your dead mom.
-[audience laughs]

622
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,093
Oh my God, it's so much worse.
I saw my mom, I was like,

623
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,178
"That lady used to make me snacks,
now she's very still."

624
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,972
I saw a dick for the first time,

625
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,975
I was like, "Oh my God!
Who took Jabba the Hutt's eyes?

626
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,184
[audience laughs]

627
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,353
You have done nothing for me. No, no, no.

628
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,231
No, I didn't say Beetlejuice
even one time!"

629
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,566
[audience laughs]

630
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,902
I haven't seen that many dicks
and I don't want to see any more

631
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:58,945
and it's nothing against men,

632
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:01,614
I'm attracted to you for some reason
but I swear to God,

633
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,909
every time you see a new dick, there
is an adjustment period, isn't there?

634
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,953
-[audience laughs]
-Just a real quick like…

635
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,080
[huffs deeply]
and we're back in it, alright.

636
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:09,998
[audience laughs]

637
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,501
I have stayed in relationships too long

638
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,295
'cause I just wasn't ready
to see a fresh one.

639
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,963
-I just couldn't
-[audience laughs]

640
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:19,924
couldn't wrap my head around it,
literally or figuratively.

641
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:23,428
I just… I just didn't have it in me,
couldn't have it in me.

642
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,431
-And…
-[audience laughs]

643
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,642
I don't care how many dicks you've seen,
every time you see a new dick,

644
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,187
it feels like jumping into a cold pool.

645
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,564
Just like, [nervously] "Alright,
let me just swim around,

646
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,483
get used to this one."

647
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:41,070
"Okay, alright, this one's deeper
than the last one but that's okay."

648
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,741
"That's alright. This is why
we take our arm floaties, you know,

649
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:46,534
for moments like these."

650
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:50,205
-[audience claps, cheers]
-[grunting]

651
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:55,376
Just control your breathing,
hot girl summer, bitch, you can do it.

652
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,086
[audience laughs]

653
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,880
I think of the genitalia
options available,

654
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,257
I think dick seem friendlier, you know.

655
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,885
They're up, they're happy to see you,
they're wagging, I've never had sex.

656
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:05,762
[audience laughs]

657
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:08,139
-It's like a front tail, right?
-[audience laughs]

658
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,266
I'll Google it, it's fine.

659
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,728
It's all speculation. I've never seen a
vagina, not even my own, I'm a Christian.

660
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,730
-[audience laughs]
-But from what I hear,

661
00:30:15,813 --> 00:30:19,526
it is very spooky down there.
It's just a dark spooky hole, like,

662
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,236
a hole? I'm sorry, what?

663
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:25,448
Every time someone fingers me, I'm like,
"You are very trusting, sir, because…"

664
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,242
-[audience laughs]
-"…I don't even know where that goes."

665
00:30:27,325 --> 00:30:30,912
"That might be where I keep the bipolar.
That might be…"

666
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,705
[audience laughs]

667
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:36,668
"…where it has been… actually, if you see
any, could you scrape it out?"

668
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,503
-"Could you…"
-[audience laughs]

669
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,296
"…just like a mental health Pap smear?"

670
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,589
-"Can you just do…"
-[audience laughs]

671
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,841
Don't do that. Like,
you gotta hook your finger,

672
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,969
like when a baby's choking,
are you familiar?

673
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,471
If you do that, it'll push it in too far,
it's too late.

674
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:52,225
But if you hook your finger, you swipe it,
that's how you get it out.

675
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,852
[audience laughs]

676
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,480
I like doing that joke
because it goes too far

677
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,691
but you do learn something
that could save a life.

678
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:03,945
[audience laughs]

679
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:09,242
I just love the idea of years from now,
someone being like,

680
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,579
"If it weren't for that dick joke,
my niece would not be here."

681
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,622
[audience laughs]

682
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:21,713
The craziest thing that happened
is my mom died of cancer.

683
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,841
-See? You almost forgot.
-[audience laughs]

684
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:29,053
And then my dad got remarried
and then our stepmom got cancer.

685
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,598
She's fine, don't worry.
I wouldn't do that to you twice.

686
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:35,977
-[audience laughs]
-That's God talking to my dad. And…

687
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:41,316
As soon as our stepmom got it,
me and my siblings were like, "Holy shit."

688
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,777
"Is Dad giving people cancer?"

689
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:45,987
[audience laughs]

690
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,572
We thought he was a carcinogen.

691
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:49,324
We were like,
"Don't microwave anything for him."

692
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,242
-[audience laughs]
-"I think that's how he's doing it."

693
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,661
If he had taken down a second one,

694
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:56,080
we would've put a warning
on his Christian Mingle account.

695
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,540
Like bare minimum, just like,

696
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:01,085
"Hey, chemicals in here
have been known to cause cancer."

697
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,922
-"Ride at your own risk."
-[audience laughs]

698
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:06,132
I feel like some people
don't believe me that she's alive.

699
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:09,802
She's completely fine, you guys.
She's happy, healthy, great lady.

700
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,221
We actually call my stepmom Mom
because when my dad married her,

701
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,389
nobody was using it.

702
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,016
So we were like,
"Yeah, be Mom, who cares."

703
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,392
[audience laughs]

704
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,686
Oh, I'm sorry, if your principal quit

705
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:22,273
and you got a new principal, they
wouldn't be like, "This is Lisa." Like…

706
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:25,610
[audience laughs]

707
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,488
Let her be principal, there is an opening.

708
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,405
[audience laughs]

709
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,492
Also, we were so young when it happened
and my dad got remarried so fast,

710
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,912
I think he was kinda hoping he could
just like Indiana Jones switch them out

711
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:38,164
-[audience laughs]
-before anybody noticed.

712
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,041
You know when you're a kid
and your hamster dies

713
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:41,918
and your parents
don't want to explain death to you

714
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,045
so they just buy you a new one
that looks the same

715
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,797
and they're like, "No, that's Connie, she
just bites now."

716
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,174
-[audience laughs]
-That's kinda what he did.

717
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,842
But with moms.

718
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,720
But I never used to talk about
any of that,

719
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,931
I never used to talk about my mom dying

720
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,724
because I didn't want
to make people uncomfortable

721
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,768
and also,
like most of us with childhood trauma,

722
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,478
should be pretty much everyone in here.

723
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,605
If you're sitting here tonight going,
"I don't think I have any,

724
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,732
I have great parents,
I had a good childhood

725
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,944
and this 'comedy show'?
It's not that fun for me."

726
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,737
-[audience laughs]
-Good.

727
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:15,660
[audience laughs]

728
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,164
I hope this is the worst night
of your whole life.

729
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,624
[audience laughs]

730
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,210
'Cause it sounds like
it's been smooth sailing

731
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:27,922
-[audience laughs]
-and you might need some perspective.

732
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,342
Most of us did have some childhood trauma

733
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,593
and when you get to be an adult,
you're like,

734
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,762
"Woo, made it!
Never have to think about that again.

735
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:35,805
Look at all my keys.

736
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,682
-The world's my oyster."
-[audience laughs]

737
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:41,060
And so you just start pushing all that
dark stuff that happened to you as a kid

738
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:44,063
down, down, down 'til you don't even
think about it anymore.

739
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,065
And that works for a long time.

740
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,150
[audience chuckles]

741
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,193
-Until one day,
-[audience laughs]

742
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,279
you stub your toe really hard on a curb

743
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:53,698
and you just start weeping uncontrollably
in the street

744
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:57,201
and you're like, "Okay,
this is about something else.

745
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,786
[audience laughs]

746
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,789
I was keeping all my trauma in that toe.

747
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,041
[audience laughs]

748
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:05,877
And then I jostled it
and now it's everywhere.

749
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,211
[audience laughs]

750
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,463
[whispering] Gone over here."

751
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:09,630
[audience laughs]

752
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,925
And if you don't deal with that stuff,
it's gonna keep affecting you in ways

753
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,719
you are not even conscious of.

754
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,472
I realized in therapy
that because my mom died young,

755
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,017
I have this irrational belief
that I am also going to die young,

756
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,936
so I've been living
in a very intense unhealthy way

757
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,522
my entire adult life where I'm like,
I can't take a break,

758
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:27,857
I gotta be working all the time,

759
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:30,485
I have to hit these goals
and achievements, otherwise I'm nothing.

760
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,695
I got engaged a few years ago
'cause I was like,

761
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,781
"I gotta get married before I'm dead"

762
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,074
which is a super hot way to propose
to somebody.

763
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:37,992
[audience laughs]

764
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,329
I call it "The Walk to Remember,"
it's kinda my move and…

765
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:45,333
[audience claps]

766
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,628
It did not work out with my ex-fiancé.

767
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:52,715
I hate that I have to say that word now.
It sounds like a spell, doesn't it?

768
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,134
[shouting]
Just like, "Ex-fiancé!" It's terrible.

769
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,803
[audience laughs]

770
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,679
He and I are not friends,

771
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,890
not 'cause he's a bad person,
he's actually a very good person.

772
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:04,268
I don't know if you've dated someone
right before they find out they're bipolar

773
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,896
but it is what is known as
"The Lord's work."

774
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,773
[audience laughs]

775
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:12,151
I think I was a great partner
if nothing went wrong.

776
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:15,530
If nothing went wrong,
I was like, awesome.

777
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,491
But if one thing went wrong,

778
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:19,700
total nightmare. Like,

779
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:24,330
I was like those spikes you drive over
when you're returning a rental car.

780
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,291
Like as long as you keep moving forward,
everything's great.

781
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:30,920
But if you back up even a little,
I will slash all your tires.

782
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,838
[audience laughs]

783
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,632
And then be like, "What? I put up a sign."

784
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:35,591
[audience laughs]

785
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,051
And you're like, "I know, I mean, I know

786
00:35:37,134 --> 00:35:39,512
I messed up a little but
like this reaction seems cra…

787
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:42,265
like other speed bumps don't react
like that." And I'm like,

788
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,475
"Then go be with her!"

789
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,603
-[audience laughs]
-[chuckles]

790
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,772
We are not friends, my ex-fiancé and I,

791
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,066
because I think it's weird
when exes try to be friends

792
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,067
with each other and they're like,

793
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,904
"We'll hang out, we'll get fro yo."
You're like, "Fro yo?

794
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,781
I know what you taste like.

795
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,868
-I'm not gonna sample yogurt with you,
-[audience laughs]

796
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:02,952
you psycho.

797
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:07,331
Do they have Kevin after a run,
do they have that flavor at Yogurtland?"

798
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,334
They do, it's salted caramel, but still.

799
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:14,714
[audience cheers, claps]

800
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,345
I went back home
after I called off my engagement

801
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:23,681
for whatever holiday doesn't offend you
and…

802
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,391
[audience laughs]

803
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:26,893
a lot of my friends are settling down.

804
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,520
Some of them are just settling, period,
end of sentence.

805
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:30,646
[audience laughs]

806
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:32,190
You guys know those couples?

807
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,816
Everyone knows one couple like that

808
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,277
where like one person in the couple
is way hotter

809
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,279
and cooler than the other person
in the couple.

810
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,073
I like to call those couples
chocolate-covered raisins.

811
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,783
[audience laughs]

812
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:47,330
Because you're like sure, you could
put those two together, if you want.

813
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:49,373
[audience laughs]

814
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:53,085
But every time you see them, you're like,
"Chocolate, what are you doing?

815
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,337
[audience laughs]

816
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,838
You could've been with anybody.

817
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:58,049
You could've been with caramel,
you could've been with marshmallow,

818
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:01,844
you could've been with peanut butter,
who I heard cures depression,

819
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:05,514
[audience laughs]

820
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:10,186
and you want to be with raisin forever?

821
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,941
Like, no offense, raisin, you're great,
we love you, nature's candy, that's you.

822
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:19,153
But you belong with like oatmeal,
like, you know that, right?

823
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,821
This doesn't feel good,

824
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,865
right? Aren't you scared every day

825
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:26,077
that someone's gonna come along
and suck chocolate right off of you?

826
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,119
[audience laughs]

827
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,746
I love this joke

828
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,539
'cause I like to see couples in the
audience looking at each other like,

829
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,583
"Am I chocolate or raisin?

830
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,335
[audience laughs]

831
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:37,421
We're both chocolate, right, babe?
We're chocolate-covered chocolate?

832
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,424
We're like those little Lindor guys
in the foil, you know?

833
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:42,051
I'm the creamy part and you're the shell

834
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:44,637
[sobbing] 'cause you're so strong and
if you leave me, I'll be a mess."

835
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:50,101
[audience laughs]

836
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:58,484
Some of you are like,
"I am oatmeal and I am good with it."

837
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,610
[audience laughs]

838
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:04,573
I made the mistake of talking
to my happiest married friend

839
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,701
after I called off my engagement,
don't do that.

840
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:11,205
Your happiest married friend doesn't
remember what it's like to be heartbroken.

841
00:38:11,288 --> 00:38:12,331
She's like,
"Well, what are you gonna do now?

842
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,458
You're gonna get back out there?
Are you seeing anybody?"

843
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,253
And I was like, "Nope, just gonna focus
on my career for a little bit."

844
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:18,170
And she's like,

845
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:21,424
"Well, why can't you focus on a career
and a relationship at the same time?"

846
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:24,844
-And I was like, "How do I explain this
-[audience chuckles]

847
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,387
in a way you might understand?

848
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,390
[muttering] Why can't
I focus on a career and a relationship?

849
00:38:29,473 --> 00:38:31,350
Have you ever been on the freeway

850
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,104
in traffic and your lane stops
but the one next to you keeps moving,

851
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,022
so you get in the one that's moving,

852
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:38,149
and as soon as you get in the one
that's moving, that one stops

853
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,859
and the one next to you
starts moving again.

854
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,652
So you get back in that first one
'cause that one's moving now

855
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,695
and as soon as you get back
in that first one,

856
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,655
that one stops again
and the one next to you starts moving.

857
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,658
And after you go back and forth a few more
times, at a certain point, you're like,

858
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:50,703
"Okay. Is it fucking me?"

859
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:55,708
[audience laughs]

860
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,882
And she's like,
"Yeah, I don't know if I get it

861
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:04,925
because you know, John and I,
we usually just boop,

862
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,802
get in the carpool lane.

863
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,013
[audience laughs]

864
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,393
And I was like, "Where's your baby?
Imma drop it!"

865
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:18,397
[audience laughs]

866
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,236
I actually did get into
a new relationship pretty quickly

867
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,821
after I called off my engagement.

868
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,656
I wasn't trying to, I really wasn't.

869
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,618
A lot of my friends were like,
"You should stay single for a while.

870
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,371
You should maybe get a cat."
And I was like, hard pass.

871
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:37,708
I have never left an interaction
with a cat feeling better about who I was.

872
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,793
[audience laughs]

873
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,837
Every cat reacts to people the way I react
to seeing girls

874
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,589
I went to middle school with in a Target.

875
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,799
Just like…

876
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,135
[audience laughs]

877
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,513
[shouts] Oh, no! Like that's every cat.

878
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:51,430
[audience laughs]

879
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,432
I don't want to come home to that energy.

880
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:54,975
[audience laughs]

881
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:57,686
But I wasn't looking for a relationship.

882
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,231
I was trying to have like a fun,
sexy fling

883
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:01,732
which doesn't usually go great for me

884
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:03,359
because I have this round wholesome face

885
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,236
that people think
they should build a life with.

886
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,153
[audience laughs]

887
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:09,740
Every time I'm like, "We could bone or
whatever." Guys are like, "No, I'm alright

888
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,826
but you could meet my mom,
do you want to do that?

889
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,578
You seem like you'd be better
at meeting my mom than having sex."

890
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:16,831
-And they are not wrong, alright?
-[audience laughs]

891
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:19,083
I will meet your mom all night long.

892
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,709
Moms like me so much for no reason.

893
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:24,338
I was dating a guy years ago, we were
totally on the rocks having problems,

894
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:26,799
and I went to lunch with his mom
hoping to get some advice,

895
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,801
and halfway through lunch,
she puts her hand on my hand

896
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,512
and goes, "You know, Taylor,
my son's a lot like his father.

897
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:32,888
[audience chuckles]

898
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:35,683
And if I could go back in time,

899
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,185
[audience laughs]

900
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:42,106
I don't know
that I'd marry his father again."

901
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,441
[audience laughs]

902
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:48,612
[audience laughs]

903
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:53,117
And I was like, "Are you saving my life
in this Panera Bread right now?"

904
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,827
[audience laughs]

905
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:58,330
It was like a movie when
an older character sacrifices themselves

906
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,749
for the good of the journey,
like she Gandalfed me.

907
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,293
She was like, "Fly, you fool!"

908
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:06,755
[audience laughs]

909
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:13,888
She was a bad mom and a bad wife
but such a good friend,

910
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,892
-oh my God! Hoes before sons, am I right?
-[audience laughs]

911
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:20,186
I think about her every day.

912
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:24,148
And my boyfriend wasn't looking
for a relationship either

913
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,734
when we met,
straight dudes usually aren't, you know.

914
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,820
Women are surprised
when they find a guy who can make them cum

915
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,780
and straight dudes are surprised when
they find a girl

916
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:34,575
who can make them
feel genuine feelings in their heart.

917
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:37,828
Like women are like,
"He got me off three times."

918
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,331
And guys are like, [in low voice] "I mean,

919
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,541
I just fucking like her, dude.

920
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:48,047
[audience laughs]

921
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,383
[in low voice] Like we talked all day,
I didn't want to hit her, it was nuts!

922
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:52,718
[audience laughs]

923
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:57,515
She's just like my friend. I don't know,
I want to like lick her heart, I think."

924
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,891
[audience laughs]

925
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:03,562
Straight dudes are so proud of themselves
for falling in love. It's really cute.

926
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,522
They're like, [in low voice] "I love you.

927
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,275
Hell yeah, buddy,
I knew you could get there."

928
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,610
[audience laughs]

929
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,987
Women fall in love,
we're like, "I love you.

930
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,989
[whispering]
Fucking again? You dumb bitch.

931
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,282
[audience laughs]

932
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,117
You were supposed to love you first,

933
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,578
-you keep skipping that part!
-[audience laughs]

934
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,622
It is eat, pray, then love!

935
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:22,581
[audience laughs]

936
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,960
Oh my God. It's okay, we'll try again
in a year and a half."

937
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,711
[audience laughs]

938
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:34,927
My boyfriend is seven years older than me

939
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,971
'cause I needed to get back
on my dad for some stuff.

940
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:39,390
[audience laughs]

941
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,183
Older guys are just better.

942
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,978
They're just better, you never
have to ask them to buy Pepto Bismol,

943
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:45,729
-they just have it in the house.
-[audience laughs]

944
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:48,357
They pull it out after dinner
like a nightcap,

945
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,733
like, "You want some pink juice,
baby girl?"

946
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,277
You're like, "Yes, I would, cheers."

947
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,736
[audience laughs]

948
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,239
Older guys don't call
you things like "cute" or "hot."

949
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:58,492
They call you things like
"stunning, gorgeous," shit with syllables,

950
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:02,329
things that would take a 20-something guy
a little while to settle down.

951
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,664
[audience laughs]

952
00:43:03,747 --> 00:43:07,126
And older guys aren't like, cute
or hot either. You know, they're handsome,

953
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,838
distinguished, like old pictures of your
grandpa you shouldn't look at too long.

954
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:16,176
[audience laughs]

955
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,679
You ever find one of those
in an old dusty box?

956
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:20,431
You're like, "Who is that?

957
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:23,309
-Oh, that's wrong. Okay."
-[audience laughs]

958
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,603
They're not your family
in those pictures yet.

959
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,022
They're just the past, it is a gray area.

960
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:30,065
[audience laughs]

961
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:31,317
Oh, I'll get weirder.

962
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,611
You ever see a picture of your parents
when they were young and hot?

963
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,154
And you get like weirdly mad

964
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:38,324
'cause you know
they would've never dated you?

965
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,700
[audience laughs]

966
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:41,994
I saw a picture of my dad
in college football once.

967
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,078
I didn't talk to him for three weeks.

968
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:46,707
I'm like, "You would've left me at a
drive-in, you Danny Zuko piece of shit!"

969
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:50,169
[audience laughs]

970
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,087
He's like, "What?" I'm like,
"I can't hug you for a year

971
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,547
and I don't want to talk about it."

972
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:56,175
[audience laughs]

973
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,594
It's always awkward getting
into a new relationship, though,

974
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,679
especially right after
you called off an engagement

975
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:04,725
because you don't feel like you can say
any cheesy romantic crap ever again.

976
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:07,478
Even if you feel it, you just feel like
you're a jinx.

977
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,396
So when the next person is like,
"I wanna be with you forever."

978
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,149
You're like,
"Oh, wouldn't that be something?

979
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,151
[audience laughs]

980
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,820
I can't… I can't use the F-word anymore

981
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:20,074
but I just need to build
my credit back up but…

982
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:23,452
-[audience laughs]
-samesies, bro, for sure."

983
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,913
New relationships are awkward

984
00:44:25,996 --> 00:44:28,248
'cause you gotta tell a whole
new person what you like in bed

985
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,625
and the only reason you know
what you like in bed

986
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:31,877
is 'cause someone
else did it to you first.

987
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,921
-[audience laughs]
-But you can't say it like that, right?

988
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,714
You gotta do that
cute little tap dance of like,

989
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,175
"Oh, babe, you know what would be so fun

990
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,844
that's never even occurred to me before?"

991
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,972
"You know what your body
is inspiring me to do right now?"

992
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:45,140
But in your head, you're just like,

993
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:48,352
-"Do it like Craig. Could you just…"
-[audience laughs]

994
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,021
"Do it how Craig did it every time?"

995
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:53,649
"Craig didn't do shit right,
he did that right, let me tell you."

996
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,275
"Can we just call him?"

997
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,403
-"Can we just call him and ask?"
-[audience laughs]

998
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:59,947
"It's not a big deal,
we're all adults here."

999
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,241
"Remember
we reset the Wi-Fi router last month?"

1000
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:05,869
"It's just like that, babe. He's just
a voice on the phone with the password."

1001
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:07,996
-[audience laughs]
-"That's all he is to me now."

1002
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,293
"No, I did block his number
when you asked me to, of course I did."

1003
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,628
"But when you block a number,

1004
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,673
your phone kinda just saves
it in a different folder."

1005
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:18,841
[audience laughs]

1006
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,970
Oh, some of us are gonna fight in the car,
not everybody knew that.

1007
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,848
[audience laughs]

1008
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:27,850
You have to be able to talk about
what you like in bed

1009
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:30,769
and you have to know
what you can and can't say,

1010
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:34,440
alright? Like I've been telling guys for
years I like it a little rougher in bed.

1011
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,691
I don't say it like that, I say like,

1012
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,819
-"Oh, I'm damaged," you know.
-[audience laughs]

1013
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,404
If you're a straight guy, don't say that.

1014
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:42,156
If a straight dude's like,
[in low voice] "I'm damaged,"

1015
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:44,450
fucking run! That guy…

1016
00:45:44,533 --> 00:45:46,994
that guy wants your toes in a baggy. So…

1017
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,997
[audience laughs]

1018
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,541
Sometimes you think you like something
and you don't.

1019
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:54,418
I thought I like dirty talk, turns out,

1020
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:58,005
I just like dirty phrases
we agreed upon earlier.

1021
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,131
[audience laughs]

1022
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,549
You ever tell someone you like dirty talk

1023
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,925
and then they hit you
with something in bed

1024
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:05,012
and you're like, "Nah,
that was not approved by corporate, no."

1025
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,389
[audience laughs]

1026
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:12,311
I was having sex with a guy once,
I was on top and he just went,

1027
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,521
[shouting] "Look at you!"

1028
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:18,066
[audience laughs]

1029
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:33,457
[audience laughs, cheers]

1030
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:46,386
-Like I was taking my first steps.
-[audience laughs]

1031
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:50,057
I'm like,
"You better get the camcorder, daddy,

1032
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,059
'cause I am never getting up here again."

1033
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,228
[audience laughs]

1034
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:57,189
My parents don't watch me
do stand-up anymore, don't worry.

1035
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,482
[audience laughs]

1036
00:46:58,565 --> 00:46:59,733
Don't worry, they're not interested.

1037
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:01,568
No Christian parents want
to watch their daughter

1038
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,530
talk about depression and dick
for an hour. It's not fun for them.

1039
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,490
[audience laughs]

1040
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,327
My parents don't have
a dark sense of humor

1041
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,788
and I do, and I'm glad I do because

1042
00:47:12,871 --> 00:47:15,082
if you can laugh at the darkest stuff
that's ever happened to you

1043
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,335
while it's still
actively happening to you,

1044
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:21,213
sometimes that's what gets you through it.
For example,

1045
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,048
here's a joke they will not like.

1046
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,008
[audience laughs]

1047
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:29,054
Did you guys know that sometimes
when you call a suicide hotline

1048
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:32,349
and the call drops,
they do not call you back?

1049
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,226
[audience laughs]

1050
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,187
Yeah, you think
that'd be the time for star 69

1051
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:39,189
but sometimes they just ring a bell
in the cubicle,

1052
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,858
like, "Lost another one, that's lunch!"

1053
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,735
[audience laughs]

1054
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,071
Some of you are tensing up like,
"Did that really happen?" Yeah,

1055
00:47:46,154 --> 00:47:49,199
a few years ago
and it was fucking hilarious.

1056
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,410
I was on the floor of a DoubleTree Hotel,

1057
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:55,122
like, "Did this bitch just ghost me while
I'm trying to ghost myself?"

1058
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,582
-"That is…"
-[audience laughs]

1059
00:47:56,665 --> 00:47:59,501
"I mean, I've been left on read,
I've never been left for dead."

1060
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,877
"That's a new one."

1061
00:48:00,961 --> 00:48:03,297
-[audience laughs]
-"That is brutal."

1062
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,758
I wasn't even mad. For all I know,
that's how they train those volunteers.

1063
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,510
Like, "Hey, some nights,

1064
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:11,888
-we get too many calls.
-[audience laughs]

1065
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,683
Fridays are big for us,
in those situations,

1066
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,935
you're just gonna have to use
your best judgment,

1067
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:21,023
alright? Like I usually wait
for like a privileged white girl name,

1068
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,567
like a Chelsea, a Kelsey, a Taylor.

1069
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:27,863
Those are the salmon I throw back
and hope they swim upstream on their own."

1070
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:31,658
[audience laughs]

1071
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,703
Even if I was mad, what am I gonna do,
hop on Yelp? Like,

1072
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,039
"One star, totally killed myself.

1073
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:41,168
[audience laughs]

1074
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,712
You're gonna wish I killed myself
after this review."

1075
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,130
[audience laughs]

1076
00:48:45,213 --> 00:48:47,424
I did that joke in Texas a few weeks ago

1077
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,594
and there was a girl, white, my age
in the crowd who goes,

1078
00:48:50,677 --> 00:48:53,263
[shouting]
"And the wait times are ridiculous!"

1079
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:58,185
[audience laughs]

1080
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,646
And she's right, okay? I think,

1081
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,981
personally,
I think if you are a frequent caller,

1082
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:05,859
there should be
some sort of rewards program.

1083
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,445
You know,
like when you show loyalty to an airline.

1084
00:49:08,528 --> 00:49:10,405
Like, you should be
able to do that with suicide hotlines

1085
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,615
where you call in and they're like,

1086
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,450
[in robotic voice]
"Please enter your rewards number."

1087
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,701
Boop, boop, boop.

1088
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:17,162
"Welcome back… [sobbing] Taylor.

1089
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,163
[audience laughs]

1090
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,839
Thank you
for your diamond medallion status.

1091
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,425
You are now third in line.

1092
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:34,596
Would you like to use an upgrade
and kick someone else out?

1093
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,974
[audience laughs]

1094
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:47,109
My parents are still very, very religious.

1095
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:48,193
My dad was so religious growing up,

1096
00:49:48,276 --> 00:49:51,780
he used to insist on praying out loud
in restaurants before we ate dinner,

1097
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:54,282
which is fine if you're into that
but keep it short.

1098
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,450
-[audience laughs]
-He wouldn't do that.

1099
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:59,162
He would do long,
drawn-out prayers full of personal details

1100
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:01,248
that none of us signed off on at the table

1101
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:04,376
which made puberty pretty rough
with your dad in public just like,

1102
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:07,212
"Thank you Lord for this food.
Thank you for bringing us here together.

1103
00:50:07,295 --> 00:50:09,548
[shouting]
Thank you that Taylor's a woman now

1104
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:12,134
and is getting the help she needs
in math." I'm like,

1105
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:16,596
"Can you not tell this Chipotle
that I'm bleeding and can't subtract?

1106
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,891
[audience laughs]

1107
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:22,436
I think God knows."

1108
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,354
It's why I don't feel bad telling jokes

1109
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,565
about my parents on stage now
'cause anytime they're like,

1110
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:29,234
"Do you have to air our dirty laundry
in front of strangers?"

1111
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:32,237
I'm like, "Hometown Buffet, 1998.

1112
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,406
[audience laughs]

1113
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,616
You told everyone
within a five-booth radius

1114
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,785
that I shat my pants the night before.

1115
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:39,953
[audience laughs]

1116
00:50:40,036 --> 00:50:43,039
-I can say whatever I want.
-[audience laughs]

1117
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,002
I'm not religious anymore.

1118
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:51,214
I have had some friends find religion as
adults recently which is very upsetting.

1119
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,841
-[inhales deeply]
-[audience laughs]

1120
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:56,720
If you grew up religious and
you're not anymore and your adult friends

1121
00:50:56,803 --> 00:51:00,307
find religion, it feels like God
is your shitty ex-boyfriend

1122
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,768
who's now getting it together
for your friend

1123
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,146
and you just have to watch it happen
on Facebook.

1124
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,690
They're like,
"Have you met God? He's amazing."

1125
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:12,444
I'm like, "Yeah, I grew up with God,
he's a douchebag, alright?

1126
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:15,197
Did he tell you you were broken
and you need him?

1127
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,991
-That's his move. That's what he does.
-[audience laughs]

1128
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:20,118
He says that to everybody.

1129
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:22,954
Don't drink what he gives you.
You drink that, the next thing you know,

1130
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,833
you're eating his body, the holy spirit's
inside you, it's a whole system they have

1131
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,587
-over at that frat house they call church.
-[audience laughs]

1132
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,757
-Who else uses Roman numerals?"
-[audience laughs]

1133
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,261
That joke makes it sound
like I resent my religious upbringing

1134
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,764
and I do, so I nailed it. But…

1135
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:46,520
[audience cheers, claps]

1136
00:51:46,603 --> 00:51:50,273
No, honestly,
if I had to come up with some stuff

1137
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,400
that was like positive
about my growing up religious,

1138
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:55,612
I'm sure I could with enough time
and money but…

1139
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,863
[audience laughs]

1140
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,534
I do have some issues with it.
It gave me some serious trust issues

1141
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,411
and it just made me weird,
growing up in church,

1142
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:05,455
in ways that I am still discovering.

1143
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:08,375
For example, I just found out
that I masturbate wrong.

1144
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:09,543
[audience laughs]

1145
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:11,878
I will back up. Okay, so…

1146
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,464
[audience laughs]

1147
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,341
When I was growing up in church,

1148
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,635
kids had youth group and at youth group,
they were like,

1149
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:21,471
"Don't have sex." And we were like,
"For sure, for sure."

1150
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,099
And then, they were like,
"Don't even masturbate."

1151
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,394
And all the girls were like, "Okay,
we didn't even know that we could."

1152
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,063
-[audience laughs]
-And all the boys were like, "Why?"

1153
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:33,400
-And…
-[audience laughs]

1154
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,027
the way they explained it to us was,

1155
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,487
our youth pastor told us, he goes,

1156
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:41,533
"It's not the physical act of masturbating
that's the sin, you guys, alright?

1157
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:43,785
It's not even the orgasm.
In fact, if you have a wet dream,

1158
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:46,454
thank God for the freebie
and have an awesome day.

1159
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,414
[audience laughs]

1160
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:50,959
But what are you thinking about
while you're doing that to yourself, guys?

1161
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,296
[scattered laughs]

1162
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:56,423
That's what the sin is.

1163
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:58,592
It's the lust in your heart.

1164
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,344
It's the impure thoughts in your head.

1165
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:03,471
That is what the sin is."

1166
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:08,059
So when I got to be an adult and I wanted
to masturbate, I was like, "Well,

1167
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,687
if I just don't think about anything,

1168
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:16,151
[audience laughs]

1169
00:53:16,234 --> 00:53:18,695
I could probably still go to heaven,
right?

1170
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:22,616
Just like, clear your mind, get in there,
get it done,

1171
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:25,243
-see you soon, Jesus, right?
-[audience laughs]

1172
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,120
Touch nothing but the lamb."

1173
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,456
[audience laughs]

1174
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:35,795
[audience claps, cheers]

1175
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,548
So I've been doing this
my entire adult life.

1176
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,885
All my friends are like, "You gotta
meditate." I'm like, "I think I do."

1177
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:42,969
[audience laughs]

1178
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:45,096
And I do mean my entire adult life,

1179
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,515
by the way. I did not masturbate
until I was a grown woman.

1180
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,352
I was that afraid of going to hell,
alright?

1181
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:53,897
Yeah. I had my first orgasm
with my college boyfriend.

1182
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,609
Do you know how embarrassing that is to
get your first orgasm from another person?

1183
00:53:57,692 --> 00:54:01,154
That's like having a realtor
show you your own house.

1184
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:02,906
[audience laughs]

1185
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,617
They're like, "And over here,
we have a second bathroom."

1186
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,620
-You're like, "A second bathroom?"
-[audience laughs]

1187
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:10,747
"You've been here for 19 years,

1188
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:12,457
you never went poking around on your own?"

1189
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:15,085
You're like, "I did once
but I thought Jesus would get mad,

1190
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,629
-[audience laughs]
-so yeah, I don't actually own this place,

1191
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:20,340
I'm just renting it from the guy upstairs,
and…

1192
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:22,384
if I flood the basement, I do not

1193
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,761
get my security deposit back, so…

1194
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:27,097
[audience laughs]

1195
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:29,224
Is there anything else I should see
while you're here?"

1196
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,976
She's like, "Yeah, let me
show you the doorbell."

1197
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:32,894
I'm like,
"Oh, is the doorbell even important?"

1198
00:54:32,978 --> 00:54:36,731
She's like, "The doorbell
is the only thing that matters.

1199
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:40,235
[audience laughs, claps]

1200
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:43,738
Nobody comes inside
without touching the doorbell."

1201
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:48,952
[audience laughs]

1202
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,328
"Oh, but I did touch it."

1203
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,205
"You didn't
use enough pressure, it didn't light up."

1204
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,874
[audience laughs]

1205
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,087
So I've been masturbating like this
my entire adult life

1206
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:01,214
and I recently mentioned it
to a friend of mine

1207
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:04,009
and you ever say something out loud
and realize you never should have ever?

1208
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:05,301
[audience laughs]

1209
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:08,221
I said it so casually over brunch,
didn't even think about it. I was like,

1210
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:10,432
"Oh yeah, I mean, I don't think
about anything while I do that."

1211
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:13,393
And she was like, "What?"
She put her fork down. "What?

1212
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,478
[audience laughs]

1213
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,397
You don't think about anything?"
And I was like,

1214
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,941
"Oh, no,
I mean, I think some stuff, obviously.

1215
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:21,401
And she was like,
"What do you think about?"

1216
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:25,989
And I was like, "Oh, you know, just like,
'almost there, making good time.'

1217
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:29,159
[audience laughs]

1218
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:31,494
You know, just like road trip thoughts,
like…

1219
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,706
'keep your hands steady,
don't fall asleep.

1220
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:36,541
Can't wait to get there so I can eat.

1221
00:55:36,624 --> 00:55:37,834
[audience laughs]

1222
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,754
Better hurry up, Taco Bell's gonna close,'
you know."

1223
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,922
[audience laughs]

1224
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,343
And she was like,
"That is so weird, Taylor,

1225
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:50,430
why don't you just watch porn
like a normal person?"

1226
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,931
And I was like, "Ugh, I don't like porn."

1227
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:53,600
Every time I try to watch porn,
I'm just like,

1228
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:55,393
"You gotta shave there, too?

1229
00:55:55,477 --> 00:55:57,437
-[audience laughs]
-I'm tired and I'm cold."

1230
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,149
And I'm not against porn, okay?
I'm not one of these people that's like,

1231
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:03,401
"If you watch porn,
it will ruin your relationship."

1232
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,819
I don't feel that way, alright?

1233
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,113
I dated a guy once
who was really into massage porn

1234
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,574
where the masseuse would like fuck
their client at the end

1235
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,409
which means sometimes when we had sex,

1236
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,578
I get a massage!

1237
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:17,373
[audience laughs, cheers]

1238
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:22,587
That's an example of porn working for you!

1239
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,547
[audience laughs]

1240
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,634
But my friend was like horrified.
She was like, "Taylor,

1241
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,720
-this like monk masturbation thing you do,
-[audience laughs]

1242
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:33,389
it is so much creepier and weirder

1243
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:37,102
than any porn I've ever seen
and I've seen most of it."

1244
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:38,561
[audience laughs]

1245
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,898
And she goes, "There are so many different
options porn-wise on the internet now,

1246
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:46,194
you… just go home and Google
'porn for women' okay?

1247
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,446
Just do it, I promise, 'porn for women.'"

1248
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,157
And so I went home
and I googled porn for women

1249
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,034
so I wouldn't be weird at brunch.

1250
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,703
[audience laughs]

1251
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,085
And a lot of surprising things came up
when I googled it.

1252
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:04,170
First thing that came up
when I googled porn for women

1253
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,840
was a link to Disney Plus
where all the Avengers movies are.

1254
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:08,800
-Now…
-[audience laughs]

1255
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:12,512
For me, personally, they jump around
too much. There's too many storylines.

1256
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,431
You're almost there with Loki and now
we're on Captain America? It's like,

1257
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,391
I have to start over.

1258
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,352
That's a different speed, a different
pressure and now there's a raccoon?

1259
00:57:19,435 --> 00:57:22,021
-No.
-[audience laughs]

1260
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:26,109
The second thing that came up
when I googled porn for women

1261
00:57:26,192 --> 00:57:28,653
was a website where real-life couples

1262
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,030
are uploading amateur sex tapes. Yeah,

1263
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:35,910
real-life couples are like,
"Hey, we're so happy and in love,

1264
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,998
we thought that we would film ourselves
making love

1265
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:43,918
and then put it online for you,
a lonely person.

1266
00:57:44,002 --> 00:57:47,172
-[audience laughs]
-Is it working? Are you wet?"

1267
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:49,674
And you're like,
"Not in the right place, no.

1268
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:50,925
[audience laughs]

1269
00:57:51,009 --> 00:57:54,721
But congratulations,
what you have seems really special."

1270
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:55,722
[audience laughs]

1271
00:57:55,805 --> 00:57:58,224
The last thing that came up
when I googled porn for women

1272
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:01,394
I did not know existed,
it's something called audio porn.

1273
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:04,522
It's exactly what it sounds like.
There's no visual aspect, it's all audio.

1274
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:07,525
It's not really a porn star,
it's more like a porn voice actor

1275
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:09,903
talking you through a sexy situation.

1276
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:13,281
It's like a podcast
except don't listen while you're driving.

1277
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,408
[audience laughs]

1278
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:18,953
And because it's "for women,"
that just means there's a story, right?

1279
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:22,332
-Anyone can watch, they don't check.
-[audience laughs]

1280
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:23,750
They don't just hop on the mic like,

1281
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,461
[shouting]
"Now it's out, bitch!" Like they

1282
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:28,046
ease you into it.

1283
00:58:28,755 --> 00:58:33,176
And so the one I found is 20 minutes long.

1284
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,720
I will send it to you if you DM me.

1285
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,764
[audience laughs]

1286
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,642
And the first 12 minutes,

1287
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:46,439
the story, is just a man calming you down

1288
00:58:46,522 --> 00:58:48,566
[audience laughs]

1289
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:52,070
after you've been in a car wreck.

1290
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:56,115
[audience laughs]

1291
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,538
That is the foreplay.

1292
00:59:01,621 --> 00:59:03,081
[audience laughs]

1293
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,335
And you guys, I came so hard. I…

1294
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:09,754
[audience laughs, claps]

1295
00:59:09,837 --> 00:59:11,381
I mean,

1296
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,425
I didn't even make it to the sex part.

1297
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,010
It was the comfort alone.

1298
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:19,222
He's like, "It's okay,
take some deep breaths, don't worry."

1299
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:22,558
"The insurance companies
will figure it out."

1300
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,977
I'm like, "Oh my God, that's right!"

1301
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,521
[shouting] "That's why we have insurance!"

1302
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,983
By the time he was like, "What else
can I do? Should I go down on you?"

1303
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:33,528
I was like, "Nah, man, I got Allstate,
I'm in good hands."

1304
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:35,280
[audience laughs]

1305
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,032
Thank you so much, Boston,
you were absolutely amazing.

1306
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,326
-[audience cheers]
-Thank you so much.

1307
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:44,163
I can't tell you, I really appreciate you.
Thank you.

1308
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,916
-[upbeat music]
-[audience cheers]

1309
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,752
You guys were amazing.
Thank you so much, seriously.

1310
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:53,131
[audience claps, cheers]

1311
01:00:40,636 --> 01:00:42,972
