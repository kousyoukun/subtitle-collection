<i> tragedies of all time</i>

00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,500

189
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,500
it wasn't the impact

190
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:58,500
that killed him.

191
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,900

a heart attack

193
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,400

194

<i>So if you ask me,</i>

195

196

I'd say kinda.

to that man's death

199
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,866
is that Aaron had set a--

200
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:11,866
a new speed record

201
00:04:11,866 --> 00:04:14,033

Welcome to "Good Sport."

350
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,966
The rooftops of London

351
00:07:22,966 --> 00:07:24,800
have been a-flutter

352
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,566
with talk that

353
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,566
you may be turning pro

354
00:07:27,566 --> 00:07:29,966
before turning 16.

355
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,566
Indubitably.

356
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,200
It would make you

357
00:07:31,566 --> 00:07:34,200
the youngest pro in history.

358
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,333
Oh, yeah,

359
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,333
indubitably.

361
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,333
<i> It was pretty obvious</i>

362
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:39,333

363
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,966
the word, "indubitably,"

364
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:43,633
<i>thinking that mixed</i>

365

00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:45,366

<i>sound smart.</i>

368
00:07:45,366 --> 00:07:47,333
Charles was by far

369
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,533
the thickest person

370
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,533
I ever met.

371
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:53,333
<i>It was like</i>

372

<i>with brain damage.</i>

374
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,833
His mother wanted him

375
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:55,833
to turn pro so badly

376
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,766
that she found a shortcut

377
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,766
for schooling.

378
00:07:57,766 --> 00:08:00,100
<i>She sent him</i>

379
00:07:57,766 --> 00:08:00,100
<i>to a vocation school</i>

380
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,733
<i>that taught him to be</i>

381
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,733
<i>a bloody lorry driver.</i>

382
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,266
I must say, you are

383
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:05,266
looking extremely fit.

384
00:08:05,266 --> 00:08:06,900
Would you mind

385
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
lifting-- lifting

386
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,900
your shirt so--

387
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,433
so we can inspect

388
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,433
the abdominal muscles?

389
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:14,733
Oh, yeah,

390
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:14,733
indubitably.

391
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,066
It was also obvious

392
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:17,066
the host of "Good Sport"

393
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:19,433
was interested in him

394
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:19,433
sexually.

00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:31,466
sure that camera

398

Crackerjack.

400
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,700
Well, Caspian Wint

401
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,700
could be

402
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,433
a bit

403
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,433
of a rapscallion.

404
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,866
That guy was a creep.

405
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,866
Nobody liked him.

406
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,700
Why do you smell

407
00:08:42,866 --> 00:08:44,700
like fire?

408
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,600
Because

409
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,600
I rage inside,

410
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,766
like a furnace.

( stammers )

412
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,833

413
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,833
have a g--

414
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,566
a girlfriend?

415
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,000
No, but I did

416
00:08:53,566 --> 00:08:57,000
have one once.

417
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,133
He was always really sweet

418
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,133
and properly fit.

419
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,600
And I know

420
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:02,600
he really did love me.

421
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,866
But, you know,

422
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,866
my modeling career

423
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,866

if I had wanted more,

428
00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:11,600
there was just

No. No, of course not.

Jan Erik

you're now number two

600
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,300

to win Wimbledon,

602
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,733
which would

603
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,733
make you number one.

604
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,733
How do you do it?

605
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:01,566
Yeah, well,

606
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:01,566
when I'm playing

607
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:01,566
I serve the ball

608
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:05,500
and the man opposite me

609
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:05,500
on the other side

610
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:05,500
of the court,

611
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
he plays it

612
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,000
back to me.

613
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,866
Now, then I try to hit

614
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,866
to a place in the court

615
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,400
that he's not

616
00:14:10,866 --> 00:14:12,400
standing in anymore.

617
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,566
And if he manages to reach

618
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,566
that and play it back,

619
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,433
if it lands short,

620
00:14:15,566 --> 00:14:17,433
I run forward

621
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,266
and then I try and get it

622
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,266
to another place

623
00:14:17,433 --> 00:14:20,266
in the court

624
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,766
that he's not

625
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,766
standing anymore.

626
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,866
And sometimes

627
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,866
it goes outside

628
00:14:21,766 --> 00:14:24,866
of these lines

629
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:27,333
on the side of the court.

630
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:27,333
And if that happens,

631
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,866
the ump, he shouts,

632
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,866
"Out!"

633
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,000
And that's--

634
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,000
that's very bad

635
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,000
if that happens to me.

636
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,366
But if it happens

637
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,366
to the other player,

638
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,366
I really like that.

639
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,800
I understand how

640
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,800
the game of tennis

641
00:14:34,366 --> 00:14:36,800
is played.

642
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,933
I guess I meant,

what's your overall

644
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,933

645
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:43,333
Yeah, yeah.

646
00:14:39,933 --> 00:14:43,333
Indubitably, yeah.

647
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,433
Okay.

648

through a wild card.

742
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,066
So I proposed we let Aaron play

743
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:46,066
for the press it would bring.

744

749
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:55,100

751
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,900
Aaron would lose badly

752
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,900

the second day was

00:20:30,566 --> 00:20:34,300
nothing short of a miracle.

00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,766
on that second day.

891
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,500
Aaron:

892
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,500
I couldn't see. Was it in?

893
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,500
Did it go in?

894
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
- Yeah.

-<i> Okay, cool.</i>

899
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,400
And that confidence

900
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,400
gave him a huge burst

901
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,400
of energy.

913
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,266
It was pretty obvious

914
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:15,900
that he had hidden cocaine

915
00:21:13,266 --> 00:21:15,900
in his water bottles...

he was on cocaine.

I'm not going to apologize

as many of you know,

1186
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,833
I've spent years searching

1187
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,833
for the true identity of

1188
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,833
my birth father.

Adopted.

And...

1192
00:28:07,033 --> 00:28:09,633

1201

00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:26,333
of Great Britain.

1204

See you on the court.

tennis is a head game.

1210
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:36,533
And it was a great move

1211
00:28:34,433 --> 00:28:36,533
to get in Charles' head.
