1
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I shall tell you of William Wallace.

2
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Historians from England will say I am a liar.

3
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,570
But history is written by those who have hanged heroes.

4
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,380
The king of Scotland had died without a son,

5
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,480
and the king of England,

6
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,990
a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks,

7
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:05,190
claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.

8
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,160
Scotland's nobles fought him

9
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,190
and fought each other over the crown.

10
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,200
So Longshanks invited them to talks of truce...

11
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,460
No weapons,one page only.

12
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,210
Among the farmers of that shire was Malcolm Wallace,

13
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,550
a commoner with his own lands.

14
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,910
He had two sons£¬John and William.

15
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,290
I told you to stay.

16
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:42,230
Well,I finished my work.

17
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:44,190
Where are we going?

18
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,130
MacAndrews'.He was supposed to visit

19
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,630
- Can I come? - No, go home, boy!

20
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:51,170
But I want to go.

21
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,400
Go home or you'll feel the back of my hand.

22
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,430
Go you home,William.

23
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,100
MacAndrews!

24
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,640
MacAndrews!

25
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,410
Holy Jesus.

26
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,630
It's all right!

27
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:26,800
William!

28
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:28,800
William!William, it's all right.

29
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,100
It's all right.Easy, lad.

30
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,250
William.

31
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,720
And I say we hit back now!

32
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,760
We cannot fight them!It's suicide!

33
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,060
Wallace is right!We fight them!

34
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:04,800
Every nobleman who had a will to fight was at that meeting.

35
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,170
We cannot beat an army.

36
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,640
Not with 50 farmers.

37
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,170
We do not have to beat them, just fight them.

38
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,740
Now, who's with me?

39
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,880
I am, Wallace.

40
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:16,310
All right, all right.

41
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,200
Where do you think you're going?

42
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,700
I'm going with you.

43
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Ah, you're going with me, are you?

44
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,200
And what are you going to do?

45
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,700
I'm going to help.

46
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,210
Hey, and a good help you'd be, too,

47
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,110
but I need you to stay here

48
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,150
I can fight.

49
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,050
I know.

50
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:59,680
I know you can fight.

51
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,460
But it's our wits that make us men.

52
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:13,300
See you tomorrow.

53
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:44,770
English.

54
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:47,200
Get down.

55
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,370
With your father and brother gone,

56
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,210
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

57
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,610
It's up to us, Hamish.

58
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:00,970
Da?

59
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,950
Da?

60
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,650
William.

61
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,560
Come here, lad.

62
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,920
Amen.

63
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:56,360
William.

64
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,140
I'm your uncle.Argyle.

65
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:15,650
You have the look of your mother.

66
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,040
We'll stay here tonight.

67
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,610
Tomorrow you'll come home with me.

68
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,140
I don't want to leave.

69
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,950
You didn't want your father to die either, did you?

70
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:39,310
But it happened.

71
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:45,620
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

72
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:47,960
"The Lord bless thee and keep thee"?

73
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:51,090
It was in Latin.

74
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,630
You don't speak Latin?

75
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,790
Well, that's something we shall have to remedy, isn't it?

76
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:03,570
"The Lord bless thee and keep thee."

77
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:07,080
"The Lord cause His light to shine on thee."

78
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:11,010
"The Lord lift up His countenance upon thee"

79
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,020
"and give thee peace."

80
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,570
Amen.

81
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,190
Your heart is free.

82
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:28,090
Have the courage to follow it.

83
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,060
What are they doing?

84
00:14:56,060 --> 00:15:00,000
Saying good-bye in their own way

85
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,430
playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

86
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:17,080
It was the same for me and your daddy

87
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,610
First, learn to use...

88
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,680
this.

89
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,620
Then I'll teach you to use...

90
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,180
this.

91
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:27,520
Many years later,

92
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Edward the Longshanks,King of England,

93
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:33,520
supervised the wedding of his eldest son,

94
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:37,420
who would succeed him to the throne.

95
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:40,760
Amen.

96
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,540
As bride for his son,

97
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:52,930
Longshanks had chosen the daughter of his rival,the king of France.

98
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,130
It was widely whispered that for the princess to conceive,

99
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,540
Longshanks would have to do the honors himself.

100
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:27,910
That may have been what he had in mind all along.

101
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:36,080
Scotland... my land.

102
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:41,690
The French will grovel to anyone with strength,

103
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:43,890
but how will they believe our strength

104
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:47,920
when we cannot rule the whole of our own island?

105
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,940
Where is my son?

106
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,480
Your pardon, milord.

107
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:04,110
He asked me to come in his stead.

108
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:07,520
I sent for him, and he sends you.

109
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,320
Shall I leave, milord?

110
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,990
If he wants his queen to rule when I am gone,

111
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:17,490
then, by all means, stay and learn how.

112
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,390
Please.

113
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,500
Nobles.

114
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,800
Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

115
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,510
Grant our nobles lands in the north,

116
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:36,010
give their nobles estates here in England,

117
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,510
and make them too greedy to oppose us.

118
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:41,520
But, sire, our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.

119
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,520
New lands mean new taxes,

120
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,520
and they're already taxed for the war in France.

121
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,520
Are they?

122
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,420
Are they?

123
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:14,680
The trouble with Scotland is that it's full of Scots.

124
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,990
Perhaps the time has come to reinstitute an old custom.

125
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:27,690
Grant them prima noctes.

126
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,400
First night.

127
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,040
When any common girl inhabiting their lands is married,

128
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:41,940
our nobles shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding.

129
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:48,050
If we cart get them out, we'll breed them out.

130
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:53,490
That should fetch just the kind of lords we want to Scotland,

131
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,560
taxes or no taxes, huh?

132
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,560
A most excellent idea, sire.

133
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,960
Is it?

134
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:08,570
Now in Edinburgh gathered the council of Scottish nobles.

135
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:13,080
Among these was Robert the 17th earl of Bruce,

136
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,270
the leading contender for the crown of Scotland.

137
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:26,090
Ah, I hear that Longshanks has granted prima noctes.

138
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,030
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.

139
00:20:30,030 --> 00:20:32,590
My father believes that we must

140
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,600
lull Longshanks into our confidence

141
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,100
by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it.

142
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,600
A wise plan.

143
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,110
And how is your father? We missed him at the council.

144
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,870
His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

145
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,610
But he sends his greetings,

146
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:55,950
and he says that I speak for all of the Bruces

147
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,280
and for Scotland.

148
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:09,050
Ah, it's all over now.

149
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:11,120
You've dropped your rock.

150
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,480
Test of manhood.

151
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,960
You win.

152
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,560
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

153
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,070
The English won't let us train with weapons,

154
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,630
so we train with stones.

155
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:28,540
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.

156
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,910
It's here.

157
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:33,070
No. It's here.

158
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:39,370
Hamish?

159
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:54,950
Here you go, son.

160
00:23:55,130 --> 00:23:57,260
Come on, Hamish!

161
00:24:14,250 --> 00:24:16,050
That was a good throw.

162
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:18,520
Aye. Aye, it was.

163
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,390
I was wondering if you could do that when it matters.

164
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:27,880
As it...As it matters in battle.

165
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,930
Could you crush a man with that throw?

166
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:35,200
I could crush you like a worm.

167
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,770
You could?

168
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:38,770
Aye.

169
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,410
Well, then do it.

170
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:44,740
Would you like to see him crush me like a worm?

171
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,780
Come do it.

172
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,620
You'll move.

173
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,590
I will not.

174
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,090
Right.

175
00:24:53,090 --> 00:24:55,180
He'll move.

176
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,860
Well done!

177
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:24,590
Fine display, young Wallace.

178
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,250
Are you all right?

179
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,060
You look a wee bit shaky.

180
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,360
I should have remembered the rocks.

181
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,290
Aye, you should have.

182
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,340
Get up, you big heap.

183
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:43,070
It's good to see you again.

184
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,970
Aye. Welcome home.

185
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,080
Oh, me head.

186
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:49,980
Oh, you should have moved.

187
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,860
William

188
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,530
will you dance with me?

189
00:26:03,530 --> 00:26:05,920
Of course I will.

190
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:34,060
I've come to claim the right of prima noctes.

191
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,560
As lord of these lands,

192
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,960
I will bless this marriage

193
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:45,860
Oh, by God,you will not!

194
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:51,730
It is my noble right.

195
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:54,030
Good evening, sin'.

196
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:56,030
Ah, young Wallace.

197
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,000
Grand soft evening, huh?

198
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,470
Aye, it's that.

199
00:28:59,470 --> 00:29:03,300
I was wondering if I might have a word with your daughter.

200
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,070
What do you want to have a word about?

201
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:12,700
Murron, would you like to come and ride with me

202
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,120
In this?You're out of your mind.

203
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,390
It's good Scottish weather, madame.

204
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:20,490
The rain is falling straight down.

205
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:22,390
Well, slightly to the side, like.

206
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:24,230
She can't go with you.

207
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,760
No the now, anyway.

208
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,930
No the now.

209
00:29:27,930 --> 00:29:30,130
- No the now? - We'll see you later.

210
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:33,000
The weather's just fine. It's hardly raining.

211
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,040
Did you not hear what I said?

212
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:38,660
Murron! Get... Oh.

213
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:42,570
It's you she takes after.

214
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:13,510
How could you know me after so long?

215
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:15,040
Well, I didn't.

216
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,380
I saw you staring,and I didn't know who you were.

217
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,940
I'm sorry.I suppose I was.

218
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:26,220
Are you in the habit of riding off in the rain with strangers?

219
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,450
It was the best way to make you leave.

220
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:35,060
Well, if I can ever work up the courage to ask you again,

221
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,630
I'll send written warning first.

222
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,330
Wouldn't do much good.I can't read.

223
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:40,400
Can you not?

224
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,570
No.

225
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,970
Well, that's something

226
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,580
You're going to teach me to read, then?

227
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,810
If you like.

228
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:51,780
In what language?

229
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:55,050
You're showing off now.

230
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:57,090
That's right.Are you impressed yet?

231
00:30:57,090 --> 00:30:59,180
No. Why should I be?

232
00:31:06,530 --> 00:31:09,100
Do that standing on your head,and I'll be impressed.

233
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,330
My kilt will fly up,but I'll try it.

234
00:31:12,330 --> 00:31:14,770
God, you certainly didn't learn any manners.

235
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:17,110
The French and Romans have far worse manners.

236
00:31:17,110 --> 00:31:18,540
You've been to Rome?

237
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:20,040
Aye. Argyle took me on a pilgrimage.

238
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,630
What was it like?

239
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,850
What does that mean?

240
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,840
Beautiful.

241
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:37,150
But I belong here.

242
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:10,560
Murron?

243
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,920
Come in now.

244
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:27,260
Sin', I know it was strange of me to invite Murron to ride last night

245
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,070
Mac Clannough's daughter is another matter.

246
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,710
I've come to fetch you to our meeting.

247
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:34,610
What kind of meeting?

248
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,340
The secret kind.

249
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:39,050
Your meetings are a waste of time, Campbell.

250
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:45,450
Your father was a fighter and a patriot.

251
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:48,420
I know who my father was.

252
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:51,560
I came back home to raise crops

253
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,530
and, God willing, a family.

254
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:58,020
If I can live in peace, I will.

255
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:01,470
You say you want to stay out of the troubles?

256
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:04,510
If you can prove it,you may court my daughter.

257
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,870
Until you prove it, my answer's no.

258
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:08,310
No?

259
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,010
No, Wallace. No.

260
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,750
Didn't I just prove it?

261
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,910
No!

262
00:34:12,910 --> 00:34:14,020
No?

263
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,240
No!

264
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:59,490
Of course, running a farm's a lot of work,

265
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,000
but that will all change when my sons arrive.

266
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,470
So you've got children?

267
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:07,000
Oh, not yet,but I was hoping

268
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,400
that you could help me with that.

269
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,970
So you want me to marry you, then?

270
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:14,610
Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

271
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:16,610
Is that what you call a proposal?

272
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:22,050
I love you. Always have.

273
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:26,650
I want to marry you.

274
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,530
Is that a "yes"?

275
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:40,930
Aye, that's a "yes."

276
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,980
We best hurry. He'll be waiting.

277
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,150
Oh, wait.

278
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:29,380
Where are you going?

279
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:35,490
What's that?

280
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:37,720
You'll see.

281
00:36:55,510 --> 00:36:57,840
Father.

282
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,960
I will love you my whole life,

283
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,890
you and no other.

284
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,470
And I you,

285
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:26,000
you and no other, forever.

286
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:56,220
When am I going to see you again?

287
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,220
Tonight?

288
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,220
I can't.

289
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,220
Why not?

290
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,620
My dad's growin' suspicious.

291
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,730
Wouldn't have anything to do with that.

292
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,230
When? When? When?

293
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,230
When?

294
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,230
Tonight.

295
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,230
Tonight.

296
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,290
Tonight.

297
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:20,270
Look lively, Sergeant.

298
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,750
Where are you going, lassie?

299
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:34,260
Ooh, that looks heavy.

300
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
Let me help you with it.

301
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,760
No. It's fine.

302
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,260
I'm not going to steal it.

303
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:44,090
Oh, you remind me of my daughter back home.

304
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,940
Hello, lassie.

305
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:14,630
No!

306
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:21,430
Keep it quiet, Smythe.

307
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:33,780
Aah! You...

308
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:36,150
bitch!

309
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,760
Are you all right?

310
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:46,620
All right? Come on.

311
00:42:47,730 --> 00:42:49,230
Are you all right?

312
00:42:49,230 --> 00:42:50,160
Aye.

313
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,530
Are you all right?

314
00:42:59,270 --> 00:43:01,180
Can you ride?

315
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:03,070
Aye.

316
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:09,850
Come back here, you bastard!

317
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:12,610
Raise the alarm!

318
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,520
Meet me at the grove.

319
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:16,720
Ride!

320
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,560
They're getting away!

321
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,880
Get him!

322
00:43:43,880 --> 00:43:47,180
Come on!

323
00:44:26,190 --> 00:44:28,590
Murron?

324
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,600
Murron!

325
00:44:45,210 --> 00:44:47,720
All of you know full well

326
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,450
the great pains I've always taken

327
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:57,220
never to be too strict, too rigid with the application of our laws,

328
00:44:57,220 --> 00:44:58,860
and as a consequence,

329
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:05,630
have we not learned to live together in relative peace and harmony?

330
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:12,670
And this day's lawlessness

331
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:17,070
is how you repay my leniency!

332
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:28,280
Well, you leave me with little choice.

333
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,120
An assault on the king's soldiers

334
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:44,900
is the same as an assault on the king himself.

335
00:45:58,150 --> 00:46:00,150
Now

336
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,490
Let this scrapper come to me.

337
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:02,040
There.

338
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,190
Corporal.

339
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:30,950
Some archers on the tower now!

340
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,760
Hold still.

341
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,140
You idiot boy!

342
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,060
Father,how are you?

343
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:58,030
Wallace! Wallace! Wallace!

344
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:18,900
What you waiting for, boy?

345
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,140
Here. You can do it.

346
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:25,040
I'll hold him down.

347
00:56:28,050 --> 00:56:30,150
Pour it straight in the wound.

348
00:56:30,150 --> 00:56:33,290
It seems like a waste of good whiskey.

349
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,450
Indulge me. Ah!

350
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,530
Hold him. Hold him.

351
00:56:38,530 --> 00:56:41,030
Hold him.

352
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,590
Now let him go.

353
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,060
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

354
00:56:48,170 --> 00:56:51,600
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

355
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:53,470
There's somebody coming!

356
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,170
Arm yourselves!

357
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,580
There's somebody coming.

358
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:07,520
MacGregors  from the next clan.

359
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:14,130
We heard about what was happening.

360
00:57:14,130 --> 00:57:19,100
We don't want you amadans thinking you can have your fun without us.

361
00:57:19,100 --> 00:57:22,290
Go home.

362
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:25,140
Some of us are in this.

363
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,140
Can't help that now.

364
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:29,740
But you can help yourselves.

365
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,810
Go home.

366
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:32,310
We'll have no homes left

367
00:57:32,310 --> 00:57:35,510
when the English garrison from the castle

368
00:57:36,780 --> 00:57:39,880
And they will.

369
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:15,520
Patrol returning, milord!

370
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:45,510
So what news?

371
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,600
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.

372
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,630
They will be returning now!

373
00:59:00,630 --> 00:59:03,730
What, are they dressed like this?

374
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,110
Actually, it was more like 50.

375
00:59:07,110 --> 00:59:09,510
Make it quick.

376
00:59:11,110 --> 00:59:12,610
You remember me?

377
00:59:12,610 --> 00:59:15,450
I never did her any harm.

378
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,950
It was my right.

379
00:59:16,950 --> 00:59:18,120
Your right?

380
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,880
I'm here to claim the right of a husband!

381
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:30,530
I am William Wallace.

382
00:59:31,130 --> 00:59:34,930
And the rest of you will be spared.

383
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,640
Go back to England and tell them there

384
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:43,040
that Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more.

385
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:47,540
Tell them Scotland is free.

386
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,750
Burn it.

387
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:32,090
The Scottish rebels have routed

388
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,360
and murdered the noble lord.

389
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,530
I heard.

390
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:39,100
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

391
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:42,640
And how would you deal with this brigand?

392
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:44,200
Like any common thief.

393
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,690
Have the local magistrate arrest him

394
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:52,340
Leave us.

395
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:05,160
Wallace has already killed the magistrate

396
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:07,790
and taken control of the town.

397
01:01:07,790 --> 01:01:10,230
Stand up.

398
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:12,070
Stand up.

399
01:01:12,070 --> 01:01:14,100
In the morning,

400
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:17,170
I depart for France to press our rights there,

401
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:21,910
and I leave you here to quell this little rebellion.

402
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,570
Understood? Is it?

403
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,980
One day, you will be a king.

404
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:36,110
At least try to act like one.

405
01:01:37,690 --> 01:01:39,360
Get away from me!

406
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:43,230
Convene my military council.

407
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,600
There!

408
01:02:28,140 --> 01:02:30,340
After them.

409
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,400
No point resisting.

410
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,010
You're outnumbered and trapped.

411
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:04,310
Now, where are the rest of you?Where's Wallace?

412
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:16,870
Father?

413
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:18,940
Oh, come in.Come in.

414
01:03:18,940 --> 01:03:21,910
A rebellion has begun.

415
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:29,790
Under whom?

416
01:03:29,790 --> 01:03:31,360
A commoner...

417
01:03:31,360 --> 01:03:33,910
named William Wallace.

418
01:03:43,730 --> 01:03:46,270
You will embrace this rebellion.

419
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:49,170
Suppon't it from our lands in the north.

420
01:03:49,170 --> 01:03:51,180
I will gain English favor

421
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:54,610
by condemning it and ordering it opposed

422
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:00,180
Sit down.

423
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,650
Stay awhile.

424
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,560
This Wallace...

425
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:13,700
he doesn't even have a knighthood,

426
01:04:13,700 --> 01:04:16,300
but he fights with passion,

427
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,870
and he inspires.

428
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:23,170
And you wish to charge off and fight as he did, eh?

429
01:04:23,170 --> 01:04:24,880
So would I.

430
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:26,310
Well, maybe it's time.

431
01:04:26,310 --> 01:04:29,680
It is time...to survive.

432
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:32,220
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

433
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:36,220
The 16 before you passed you land and title

434
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:39,550
because they didn 't charge in.

435
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:42,360
Call a meeting of the nobles.

436
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,100
They do nothing but talk.

437
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:45,230
Rightly so.

438
01:04:45,230 --> 01:04:50,670
But history is written by those who have hanged heroes.

439
01:04:50,670 --> 01:04:52,670
You admire this man, this William Wallace.

440
01:04:52,670 --> 01:04:55,370
Uncompromising men are easy to admire.

441
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:57,880
He has courage. So does a dog.

442
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,540
But it is exactly the ability to compromise

443
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:04,680
And understand this...

444
01:05:04,680 --> 01:05:07,690
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king

445
01:05:07,690 --> 01:05:11,190
ever to sit on the throne of England,

446
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:14,690
and none of us and nothing of Scotland

447
01:05:14,690 --> 01:05:18,560
will remain unless we are as ruthless.

448
01:05:19,100 --> 01:05:22,200
Give ear to our nobles.

449
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:24,200
Knowing their minds

450
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:27,470
is the key to the throne.

451
01:05:43,320 --> 01:05:44,720
Wait. Wait.

452
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:45,720
Look.

453
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:48,730
This is out, and this is left.

454
01:05:48,730 --> 01:05:50,160
Carry on.

455
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:52,530
Carry on!

456
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,430
You know

457
01:07:35,430 --> 01:07:38,060
eventually, Longshanks will send

458
01:07:39,870 --> 01:07:41,340
Heavy cavalry, armored horse...

459
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,770
shake the very ground.

460
01:07:43,910 --> 01:07:46,080
They'll ride right over us.

461
01:07:46,080 --> 01:07:48,680
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it,

462
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:51,950
how no army ever stood up to a charge of heavy horse.

463
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:53,620
So what do we do?

464
01:07:53,620 --> 01:07:57,180
Hit, run, hide, the Highland way.

465
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,590
We'll make spears.

466
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,630
Hundreds of them.

467
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:11,740
Long spears...twice as long as a man.

468
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:13,540
That long?

469
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:14,640
Aye.

470
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:17,140
Some men are longer than others.

471
01:08:17,140 --> 01:08:21,270
Your mother been telling you stories about me again.

472
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:25,870
Volunteers coming in!

473
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:27,690
William Wallace,

474
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:30,650
we've come to fight and to die for you.

475
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:33,690
Stand up, man. I'm not the pope.

476
01:08:33,690 --> 01:08:36,460
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

477
01:08:36,460 --> 01:08:37,800
I brought you this.

478
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:40,230
We checked them for arms.

479
01:08:40,230 --> 01:08:42,200
I brought you this.

480
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,970
My wife made it for you.

481
01:08:44,970 --> 01:08:47,560
Thank you.

482
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:53,610
Him? That can't be William Wallace.

483
01:08:53,610 --> 01:08:56,740
I'm prettier than this man.

484
01:08:58,620 --> 01:09:02,640
All right, Father.I'll ask him.

485
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:07,730
If I risk my neck for you,

486
01:09:07,730 --> 01:09:09,930
will I get a chance to kill Englishmen?

487
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,930
Is your father a ghost,

488
01:09:11,930 --> 01:09:14,500
or do you converse with the Almighty?

489
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,330
To find his equal, an Irishman talks to God.

490
01:09:17,330 --> 01:09:20,000
The Almighty says don't change the subject.

491
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,840
Just answer the fucking question.

492
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,270
Mind your tongue.

493
01:09:23,270 --> 01:09:25,670
Insane Irish.

494
01:09:27,950 --> 01:09:32,280
Smart enough to get a dagger past your guards, old man.

495
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:34,350
That's my friend, Irishman,

496
01:09:34,350 --> 01:09:37,020
and the answer to your question is yes.

497
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:40,360
You fight for me, you get to kill the English.

498
01:09:40,360 --> 01:09:41,390
Excellent!

499
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:42,890
Stephen is my name.

500
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:45,900
I'm the most wanted man on my island,

501
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:48,900
except I'm not on my island, of course.

502
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:50,400
More's the pity.

503
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,200
Your island? You mean Ireland?

504
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,670
Yeah. It's mine.

505
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:01,230
You're a madman.

506
01:10:07,420 --> 01:10:11,510
I've come to the right place, then.

507
01:11:29,730 --> 01:11:34,130
Sure didn't the Almighty send me to watch your back?

508
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,590
I didn't like him anyway.

509
01:11:40,870 --> 01:11:43,870
He wasn't right in the head.

510
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:14,010
The English are advancing an army toward Stirling.

511
01:12:14,010 --> 01:12:15,180
Do the nobles rally?

512
01:12:15,180 --> 01:12:17,010
Robert the Bruce and most of the others

513
01:12:17,010 --> 01:12:18,450
will not commit to battle,

514
01:12:18,450 --> 01:12:20,180
but word has spread,

515
01:12:20,180 --> 01:12:23,180
and the Highlanders are coming down on their own.

516
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:25,450
In droves of hundreds and thousands.

517
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:28,580
Are you ready for a war?

518
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,700
What news?

519
01:12:44,700 --> 01:12:46,710
We're outnumbered, at least three to one.

520
01:12:46,710 --> 01:12:48,040
How many horse?

521
01:12:48,040 --> 01:12:49,140
300. Maybe more.

522
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:50,710
300 heavy horse?

523
01:12:50,710 --> 01:12:52,180
We must negotiate.

524
01:12:52,180 --> 01:12:53,980
Who's in command?

525
01:12:53,980 --> 01:12:56,480
Did he have a scarlet chevron?

526
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:57,980
Aye, he did.

527
01:12:57,980 --> 01:13:00,880
We can still negotiate.

528
01:13:03,490 --> 01:13:05,990
What are they talking about?

529
01:13:05,990 --> 01:13:09,500
I can't hear, but it does not look good.

530
01:13:09,500 --> 01:13:11,500
The nobles will negotiate.

531
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:13,500
They'll do a deal,

532
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:15,500
then we go home.

533
01:13:15,500 --> 01:13:17,800
If not, we charge.

534
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,360
We have no chance.

535
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:21,830
So many.

536
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:28,410
I didn't come here to fight

537
01:14:29,510 --> 01:14:31,510
Then I'll have to work for them.

538
01:14:31,510 --> 01:14:33,570
Nor me.

539
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,020
All right, lads! I'm not dying for these bastards.

540
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:39,990
Let's go home!

541
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:01,140
Stop, men! Do not flee!

542
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:04,840
Wait until we've negotiated!

543
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,470
William Wallace.

544
01:15:58,470 --> 01:16:01,430
Can't be. Not tall enough.

545
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:24,320
The Almighty says this must be a fashionable fight.

546
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,160
It's drawn the finest people.

547
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:28,160
Where is thy salute?

548
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,160
For presenting yourselves on this battlefield,

549
01:16:30,160 --> 01:16:31,630
I give you thanks.

550
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,000
This is our army.

551
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,770
To join it, you give homage.

552
01:16:34,770 --> 01:16:37,270
I give homage to Scotland,

553
01:16:37,270 --> 01:16:40,940
and if this is your army...

554
01:16:40,940 --> 01:16:42,610
why does it go?

555
01:16:42,610 --> 01:16:45,910
We didn't come here to fight for them!

556
01:16:48,950 --> 01:16:52,350
Home!The English are too many.

557
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:02,460
Sons of Scotland...

558
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:05,100
I am William Wallace.

559
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:06,970
William Wallace is 7 feet tall.

560
01:17:06,970 --> 01:17:08,470
Yes. I've heard.

561
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,970
He kills men by the hundreds,

562
01:17:10,970 --> 01:17:13,970
and if he were here, he'd consume the English

563
01:17:13,970 --> 01:17:15,980
with fireballs from his eyes

564
01:17:15,980 --> 01:17:19,140
and bolts of lightning from his arse.

565
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:24,980
I am William Wallace

566
01:17:24,980 --> 01:17:29,490
and I see a whole army of my countrymen

567
01:17:29,490 --> 01:17:34,720
here in defiance of tyranny.

568
01:17:36,000 --> 01:17:39,560
You've come to fight as free men.

569
01:17:40,500 --> 01:17:43,900
And free men you are.

570
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:48,910
What will you do with that freedom?

571
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:51,510
Will you fight?

572
01:17:51,510 --> 01:17:53,750
- No! - No!

573
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:54,550
- No! - No!

574
01:17:54,550 --> 01:17:56,780
Against that?No!

575
01:17:56,780 --> 01:18:01,010
We will run, and we will live.

576
01:18:01,420 --> 01:18:04,420
Fight, and you may die.

577
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:07,430
Run, and you'll live...

578
01:18:07,430 --> 01:18:10,050
at least awhile.

579
01:18:11,830 --> 01:18:15,940
And dying in your beds many years from now,

580
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:19,570
would you be willing to trade

581
01:18:19,570 --> 01:18:22,440
all the days from this day to that

582
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:25,310
for one chance  just one chance

583
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:28,280
to come back here and tell our enemies

584
01:18:28,280 --> 01:18:30,950
that they may take our lives,

585
01:18:30,950 --> 01:18:35,720
but they'll never take our freedom!

586
01:19:01,850 --> 01:19:03,580
They seem quite optimistic to me.

587
01:19:03,580 --> 01:19:05,150
Maybe they do want to fight.

588
01:19:05,150 --> 01:19:08,420
Confrontation might be a foregone conclusion, milord,

589
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:09,920
but, nonetheless,

590
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:12,390
I think we should deliver the king's terms.

591
01:19:12,390 --> 01:19:15,060
The king's terms? He'll never live up to them.

592
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:17,530
Milord, I think...

593
01:19:17,530 --> 01:19:20,520
All right. Offer them the terms.

594
01:19:23,140 --> 01:19:25,040
Shall we go and meet them?

595
01:19:25,040 --> 01:19:27,310
Let me do the talking.

596
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:29,400
Agreed.

597
01:19:33,410 --> 01:19:35,450
Fine speech.

598
01:19:35,450 --> 01:19:38,350
Now what do we do?

599
01:19:38,950 --> 01:19:40,890
Just be yourselves.

600
01:19:40,890 --> 01:19:43,060
Where are you going?

601
01:19:43,060 --> 01:19:47,180
I'm going to pick a fi ght.

602
01:19:52,270 --> 01:19:56,460
Well, we didn't get dressed up for nothing.

603
01:19:58,270 --> 01:20:01,210
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

604
01:20:04,240 --> 01:20:06,980
Here are the king's terms

605
01:20:06,980 --> 01:20:12,580
Lead this army off the field

606
01:20:13,190 --> 01:20:19,090
and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire,

607
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:20,760
including hereditary title,

608
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:24,360
from which you will pay...

609
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,400
from which you will pay him an annual duty

610
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:28,470
I have an offer foryou.

611
01:20:28,470 --> 01:20:30,300
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

612
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:34,140
From which you will pay the king an annual duty...

613
01:20:34,140 --> 01:20:35,980
I said I have an offer foryou.

614
01:20:35,980 --> 01:20:37,540
You disrespect a banner oftruce?

615
01:20:37,540 --> 01:20:40,340
From his king? Absolutely.

616
01:20:40,450 --> 01:20:42,520
Here are Scotland's terms...

617
01:20:42,520 --> 01:20:45,420
Lower your flags

618
01:20:45,420 --> 01:20:46,920
and march straight back to England,

619
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:48,450
stopping at every home you pass by

620
01:20:48,450 --> 01:20:51,960
to beg forgiveness  for 100 years oftheft   rape   and murder.

621
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:55,300
Do that, and your men shall live.

622
01:20:55,300 --> 01:21:00,200
Do it not, and every one of you will die today.

623
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:07,640
You are outmatched.

624
01:21:07,640 --> 01:21:09,980
You have no heavy cavalry.

625
01:21:09,980 --> 01:21:12,780
In two centuries, no army has won...

626
01:21:12,780 --> 01:21:15,640
I'm not finished!

627
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:17,980
Before we let you leave,

628
01:21:17,980 --> 01:21:20,790
your commander must cross that field,

629
01:21:20,790 --> 01:21:23,490
present himself before this army,

630
01:21:23,490 --> 01:21:25,490
put his head between his legs,

631
01:21:25,490 --> 01:21:27,980
and kiss his own arse.

632
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:41,170
I'd say that was rather less cordial than he's used to.

633
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,980
Be ready and do exactly as I say.

634
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:44,610
On my signal,

635
01:21:44,610 --> 01:21:47,750
ride round behind our position and flank them.

636
01:21:47,750 --> 01:21:49,380
We must not divide our forces.

637
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:52,320
Do it, and let the English see you do it.

638
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,290
They'll think we run away.

639
01:21:54,290 --> 01:21:59,190
Take out their archers. I'll meet you in the middle.

640
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:26,490
Insolent bastard.

641
01:22:26,490 --> 01:22:29,490
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate.

642
01:22:29,490 --> 01:22:31,090
Archers.

643
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:33,030
Archers! Archers!

644
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:35,390
Archers!

645
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:43,630
Archers, forward!

646
01:23:39,330 --> 01:23:41,590
You bastards!

647
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:17,320
Loose!

648
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:39,220
The Lord tells me he can get me out of this mess,

649
01:24:39,220 --> 01:24:42,410
but He's pretty sure you're fucked.

650
01:25:02,610 --> 01:25:03,810
Ready!

651
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:05,970
Loose!

652
01:25:28,330 --> 01:25:31,040
See. Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

653
01:25:31,040 --> 01:25:33,940
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.

654
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:35,410
Send the horse.

655
01:25:35,410 --> 01:25:37,970
Full attack.

656
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:55,010
Steady!

657
01:26:55,450 --> 01:26:57,610
Hold!

658
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,290
Hold!

659
01:27:05,160 --> 01:27:07,100
Hold!

660
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,900
Hold!

661
01:27:23,680 --> 01:27:27,520
Now!

662
01:28:12,300 --> 01:28:13,900
Send the infantry.

663
01:28:13,900 --> 01:28:16,830
You lead them!

664
01:30:34,640 --> 01:30:37,700
Retreat!

665
01:31:11,440 --> 01:31:14,410
Bastard!

666
01:31:56,560 --> 01:31:59,080
All right.

667
01:32:48,040 --> 01:32:51,240
Wallace! Wallace!

668
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:15,460
I knight thee Sire William Wallace.

669
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:21,240
Sire William, in the name of God,

670
01:33:21,240 --> 01:33:22,880
we declare and appoint thee

671
01:33:22,880 --> 01:33:24,710
guardian and high protector of Scotland

672
01:33:24,710 --> 01:33:28,650
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

673
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:31,770
Stand and be recognized.

674
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:42,900
Does anyone know his politics?

675
01:33:42,900 --> 01:33:45,000
No, but his weight with the commoners

676
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:47,530
could unbalance everything.

677
01:33:47,530 --> 01:33:49,740
The Balliols will kiss his arse,

678
01:33:49,740 --> 01:33:51,960
and so we must.

679
01:33:58,910 --> 01:34:01,900
Sire William.

680
01:34:04,350 --> 01:34:05,550
Sire William...

681
01:34:05,550 --> 01:34:09,450
inasmuch as you and your captains

682
01:34:13,990 --> 01:34:17,530
may we invite you to continue your support

683
01:34:17,530 --> 01:34:19,160
and uphold our rightful claim.

684
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:22,030
Damn the Balliol clan!

685
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:24,600
They're all Longshanks' men!

686
01:34:24,600 --> 01:34:26,590
Gentlemen.

687
01:34:26,710 --> 01:34:28,370
Gentlemen.

688
01:34:28,370 --> 01:34:31,310
Now is the time to declare a king.

689
01:34:31,310 --> 01:34:34,480
You're prepared to recognize our legitimate succession?

690
01:34:34,480 --> 01:34:36,650
You're the ones who won't suppon't the rightful...

691
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:39,170
Those were lies...

692
01:34:40,550 --> 01:34:42,890
I demand recognition of these documents!

693
01:34:42,890 --> 01:34:46,290
These documents were lies when you wrote them!

694
01:34:46,890 --> 01:34:49,060
Gentlemen, please! Gentlemen!

695
01:34:49,060 --> 01:34:51,360
Please, gentlemen!

696
01:34:51,360 --> 01:34:55,330
Wait! Sire William, where are you going?

697
01:34:55,330 --> 01:34:58,340
We have beaten the English,

698
01:34:58,340 --> 01:35:00,170
but they'll come back

699
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:02,510
because you won't stand together.

700
01:35:02,510 --> 01:35:04,840
What will you do?

701
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,850
I will invade England

702
01:35:06,850 --> 01:35:10,050
and defeat the English on their own ground.

703
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:14,350
Invade? That's impossible.

704
01:35:14,350 --> 01:35:15,350
Why?

705
01:35:15,350 --> 01:35:17,090
Why is that impossible?

706
01:35:17,090 --> 01:35:19,160
You're so concerned with squabbling

707
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:21,860
for the scraps from Longshanks' table

708
01:35:21,860 --> 01:35:26,930
that you've missed your God-given right to something better.

709
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:28,930
There's a difference between us.

710
01:35:28,930 --> 01:35:30,940
You think the people of this country exist

711
01:35:30,940 --> 01:35:32,940
to provide you with position.

712
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:34,940
I think your position exists

713
01:35:34,940 --> 01:35:37,880
to provide those people with freedom,

714
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:43,470
and I go to make sure that they have it.

715
01:35:54,830 --> 01:35:57,230
Wait!

716
01:35:59,160 --> 01:36:01,230
I respect what you said,

717
01:36:01,230 --> 01:36:03,200
but remember that these men

718
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:04,940
have lands and castles.

719
01:36:04,940 --> 01:36:06,940
It's much to risk.

720
01:36:06,940 --> 01:36:09,170
The common man that bleeds on the battlefield...

721
01:36:09,170 --> 01:36:11,610
does he risk less?

722
01:36:14,850 --> 01:36:16,350
No...

723
01:36:16,350 --> 01:36:18,350
but from top to bottom,

724
01:36:18,350 --> 01:36:20,850
this country has got no sense of itself.

725
01:36:20,850 --> 01:36:23,360
Its nobles share allegiance with England.

726
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,590
Its clans war with each other.

727
01:36:27,190 --> 01:36:29,860
If you make enemies on both sides of the border,

728
01:36:29,860 --> 01:36:31,360
you'll end up dead.

729
01:36:31,360 --> 01:36:33,370
We all end up dead.

730
01:36:33,370 --> 01:36:35,700
It's just a question of how and why.

731
01:36:35,700 --> 01:36:37,600
I want what you want,

732
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:39,470
but we need the nobles.

733
01:36:39,470 --> 01:36:41,160
We need them?

734
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:43,600
Nobles.

735
01:36:43,600 --> 01:36:46,400
Tell me, what does that mean...to be noble?

736
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:48,960
Your title gives you claim

737
01:36:49,940 --> 01:36:51,880
but men don't follow titles,

738
01:36:51,880 --> 01:36:53,410
they follow courage.

739
01:36:53,410 --> 01:36:55,510
Now, our people know you.

740
01:36:55,510 --> 01:36:58,020
Noble and common...they respect you,

741
01:36:58,020 --> 01:37:02,780
and if you would just lead them to freedom...

742
01:37:03,390 --> 01:37:05,790
they'd follow you.

743
01:37:07,130 --> 01:37:09,590
And so would I.

744
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:32,050
Damn it!

745
01:37:32,050 --> 01:37:33,890
My sodomite cousin the prince tells me

746
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,890
he has no troops to lend,

747
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:39,880
and every town in Northern England is begging for help.

748
01:37:40,230 --> 01:37:41,690
He advances!

749
01:37:41,690 --> 01:37:43,190
To which town?

750
01:37:43,190 --> 01:37:45,060
To here, milord.

751
01:37:45,060 --> 01:37:46,430
Bring the provisions inside!

752
01:37:46,430 --> 01:37:49,370
Double the wall guards! Seal the gate! Now!

753
01:37:49,700 --> 01:37:52,730
Bring in the provisions!

754
01:38:22,370 --> 01:38:25,070
Sire, we can get you out if you leave now.

755
01:38:25,070 --> 01:38:26,870
I'm not about to tell my uncle

756
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:31,000
I've lost him the greatest city in Northern England.

757
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:12,250
Come on!

758
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:49,010
Make way for the king!

759
01:39:56,460 --> 01:39:58,960
It's not your fault.

760
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,970
Stand up to him!

761
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:04,870
I will stand up to him and more.

762
01:40:41,010 --> 01:40:43,630
What news of the north?

763
01:40:44,010 --> 01:40:45,880
Nothing new, Your Majesty.

764
01:40:45,880 --> 01:40:48,810
We've sent riders to speed any word.

765
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:51,320
I heard the word in France,

766
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:56,790
where I was fighting to expand your future kingdom.The word   my son

767
01:40:56,790 --> 01:41:02,160
is that our entire northern army is annihilated...

768
01:41:02,160 --> 01:41:04,600
and you have done nothing.

769
01:41:04,600 --> 01:41:06,600
I have ordered conscriptions.

770
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:10,360
They're assembled and ready to depart.

771
01:41:11,240 --> 01:41:14,910
Excuse me, sire, but there's a very urgent message from York.

772
01:41:14,910 --> 01:41:17,310
Come.

773
01:41:24,020 --> 01:41:25,350
Leave us.

774
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:28,480
Thank you, sire.

775
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:32,120
Uh, W-Wallace has sacked York.

776
01:41:32,120 --> 01:41:33,320
What?

777
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:36,820
Wallace has sacked York.

778
01:41:50,000 --> 01:41:51,560
Sire...

779
01:41:51,560 --> 01:41:53,700
thy own nephew.

780
01:41:53,700 --> 01:41:57,600
What beast could do such a thing?

781
01:41:58,200 --> 01:42:01,100
If he can sack York...

782
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:04,540
he can invade Lower England.

783
01:42:04,540 --> 01:42:07,240
We would stop him!

784
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:11,980
Who is this person who speaks to me

785
01:42:11,980 --> 01:42:15,220
as though I needed his advice?

786
01:42:15,220 --> 01:42:18,320
I have declared Phillip my high counselor.

787
01:42:18,320 --> 01:42:19,720
Is he qualified?

788
01:42:19,720 --> 01:42:22,560
I am skilled in the arts of war

789
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:25,360
and military tactics, sire.

790
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:27,730
Are you?

791
01:42:27,730 --> 01:42:30,600
Then tell me...what advice would you offer

792
01:42:30,600 --> 01:42:34,510
on the, uh, present, uh,

793
01:42:34,510 --> 01:42:36,500
situation?

794
01:43:05,200 --> 01:43:08,710
I shall offer a truce...

795
01:43:08,710 --> 01:43:12,110
and buy him off.

796
01:43:12,710 --> 01:43:15,210
But who will go to him?

797
01:43:15,210 --> 01:43:17,220
Not I.

798
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:20,220
If I fell under the sword of that murderer,

799
01:43:20,220 --> 01:43:23,220
it might be my head in a basket.

800
01:43:23,220 --> 01:43:27,930
And not my gentle son.

801
01:43:27,930 --> 01:43:29,930
The mere sight of him

802
01:43:29,930 --> 01:43:35,130
would only encourage an enemy to take over the whole country.

803
01:43:35,730 --> 01:43:39,130
So whom do I send?

804
01:43:42,740 --> 01:43:45,870
Whom do I send?

805
01:45:07,330 --> 01:45:08,690
I'm dreaming.

806
01:45:08,690 --> 01:45:11,680
Yes, you are.

807
01:45:12,330 --> 01:45:14,990
And you must wake.

808
01:45:23,340 --> 01:45:25,840
I don't want to wake.

809
01:45:25,840 --> 01:45:30,080
I want to stay here with you.

810
01:45:30,520 --> 01:45:32,850
And I with you...

811
01:45:32,850 --> 01:45:35,580
but you must wake now.

812
01:45:38,360 --> 01:45:40,360
Wake up, William.

813
01:45:40,360 --> 01:45:42,660
Wake up.

814
01:45:44,430 --> 01:45:46,430
William, wake up, wake up.

815
01:45:46,430 --> 01:45:47,800
William!

816
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:50,370
A royal entourage comes!

817
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:51,870
Flying banners of truce!

818
01:45:51,870 --> 01:45:56,970
And the standards of Longshanks himself!

819
01:46:37,980 --> 01:46:40,490
I am the princess of Wales.

820
01:46:40,490 --> 01:46:44,290
I come as the king's servant and with his authority.

821
01:46:44,290 --> 01:46:46,060
To do what?

822
01:46:46,060 --> 01:46:50,050
To discuss the king's proposals.

823
01:46:51,630 --> 01:46:56,000
Will you speak with a woman?

824
01:47:13,590 --> 01:47:17,260
I understand you have recently been given the rank of knight.

825
01:47:17,260 --> 01:47:19,320
I have been given nothing.

826
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:21,590
God makes men what they are.

827
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:25,430
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities?

828
01:47:25,430 --> 01:47:27,930
The executioner of the king's nephew,

829
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:29,830
my husband's own cousin?

830
01:47:29,830 --> 01:47:34,340
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country,

831
01:47:34,340 --> 01:47:36,840
and that royal cousin hanged innocent Scots,

832
01:47:36,840 --> 01:47:40,140
even women and children from the city walls.

833
01:47:43,350 --> 01:47:46,180
Well, Longshanks did far worse

834
01:48:06,740 --> 01:48:09,310
You ask your king to his face.

835
01:48:09,310 --> 01:48:11,270
Ask him.

836
01:48:12,510 --> 01:48:17,000
You see if his eyes can convince you of the truth.

837
01:48:24,320 --> 01:48:27,720
Hamilton, leave us.

838
01:48:28,760 --> 01:48:29,760
Milady...

839
01:48:29,760 --> 01:48:32,490
Leave us. Now.

840
01:48:42,340 --> 01:48:44,780
Let us talk plainly.

841
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:46,280
You invade England,

842
01:48:46,280 --> 01:48:49,680
but you cannot complete the conquest

843
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:54,950
The king desires peace.

844
01:48:54,950 --> 01:48:57,960
Longshanks desires peace?

845
01:48:57,960 --> 01:49:00,290
He declares it to me. I swear it.

846
01:49:00,290 --> 01:49:03,130
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

847
01:49:03,130 --> 01:49:05,300
In return, he grants you title, estates,

848
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:08,970
and this chest of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.

849
01:49:08,970 --> 01:49:11,300
A lordship and titles...

850
01:49:11,300 --> 01:49:12,800
gold...

851
01:49:12,800 --> 01:49:14,570
that I should become Judas?

852
01:49:14,570 --> 01:49:16,740
Peace is made in such ways.

853
01:49:16,740 --> 01:49:19,440
Slaves are made in such ways!

854
01:49:21,310 --> 01:49:23,820
The last time Longshanks spoke of peace,

855
01:49:23,820 --> 01:49:25,320
I was a boy,

856
01:49:25,320 --> 01:49:27,720
and many Scottish nobles,

857
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,820
were lured by him, under a flag of truce,

858
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:34,220
to a barn... where he had them hanged.

859
01:49:34,930 --> 01:49:36,430
I was very young,

860
01:49:36,430 --> 01:49:40,830
but I remember Longshanks' notion of peace.

861
01:49:43,100 --> 01:49:46,700
I understand you have suffered.

862
01:49:47,340 --> 01:49:51,740
I know... about your woman.

863
01:50:01,350 --> 01:50:04,250
She was my wife.

864
01:50:05,860 --> 01:50:07,860
We married in secret

865
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:11,860
because I would not share her with an English lord.

866
01:50:11,860 --> 01:50:16,300
They killed her...to get to me.

867
01:50:20,370 --> 01:50:23,370
I have never spoken of it.

868
01:50:23,370 --> 01:50:26,380
I don't know why I tell you now,

869
01:50:26,380 --> 01:50:28,780
except...

870
01:50:29,380 --> 01:50:32,510
I see her strength in you.

871
01:50:37,890 --> 01:50:41,890
One day, you'll be a queen...

872
01:50:41,890 --> 01:50:45,330
And you must open your eyes.

873
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:54,840
You tell your king that William Wallace

874
01:50:54,840 --> 01:50:56,840
will not be ruled...

875
01:50:56,840 --> 01:51:00,670
and nor will any Scot while I live.

876
01:51:32,500 --> 01:51:36,000
Ah, my son's loyal wife returns

877
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:38,000
unkilled by the heathen.

878
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:40,540
So he accepted our bribe?

879
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:42,670
No, he did not.

880
01:51:42,670 --> 01:51:44,940
Then why does he stay?

881
01:51:44,940 --> 01:51:49,380
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

882
01:51:49,380 --> 01:51:51,450
He waits for you at York.

883
01:51:51,450 --> 01:51:54,450
He says he will attack no more towns or cities

884
01:51:54,450 --> 01:51:56,720
if you are man enough to come and face him.

885
01:51:56,720 --> 01:51:59,490
Did he?

886
01:51:59,490 --> 01:52:03,960
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

887
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:07,460
arriving so far around his flank.

888
01:52:07,460 --> 01:52:10,470
The main force of our armies from France

889
01:52:10,470 --> 01:52:14,040
will land here to the north of Edinburgh.

890
01:52:14,040 --> 01:52:20,480
Conscripts from Ireland will approach from the southwest to here.

891
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,980
Welsh bowmen? Troops from France? Irish conscripts?

892
01:52:22,980 --> 01:52:24,980
Even if you dispatch them today,

893
01:52:24,980 --> 01:52:26,850
they'd take weeks to assemble.

894
01:52:26,850 --> 01:52:32,080
I dispatched them before I sent your wife.

895
01:52:35,490 --> 01:52:37,960
So our little ruse succeeded.

896
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:40,100
Thank you.

897
01:52:40,100 --> 01:52:41,600
And while this upstart

898
01:52:41,600 --> 01:52:43,430
awaits my arrival in York,

899
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:48,470
my forces will have arrived in Edinburgh behind him.

900
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:56,250
You spoke with this, uh, Wallace in private.

901
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:58,750
Tell me...

902
01:52:58,750 --> 01:53:01,620
what kind of man is he?

903
01:53:01,620 --> 01:53:05,450
A mindless barbarian.

904
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:09,450
Not a king like you, milord.

905
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:13,460
You may return to your embroidery.

906
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:14,960
Humbly, milord.

907
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:19,330
You brought back the money, of course.

908
01:53:21,970 --> 01:53:28,030
No. I gave it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.

909
01:53:29,610 --> 01:53:32,840
That's what happens when you send a woman.

910
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:35,480
Forgive me, sire.

911
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:36,990
I thought that generosity

912
01:53:36,990 --> 01:53:38,490
might demonstrate your greatness

913
01:53:38,490 --> 01:53:42,320
to those you mean to rule.

914
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:47,930
My greatness will be better demonstrated

915
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:50,870
when Wallace returns to Scotland

916
01:53:50,870 --> 01:53:54,840
and finds his country in ashes.

917
01:53:58,110 --> 01:53:59,440
William!

918
01:53:59,440 --> 01:54:02,340
There's riders approaching!

919
01:54:07,650 --> 01:54:12,850
Personal escort of the princess.

920
01:54:17,960 --> 01:54:21,860
I didn't think you were in the tent that long.

921
01:54:24,970 --> 01:54:27,300
Mademoiselle.

922
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:30,710
Un message de ma maitresse.

923
01:54:30,710 --> 01:54:33,370
Merci.

924
01:54:56,930 --> 01:55:00,270
It's true! English ships are moving up from the south!

925
01:55:00,270 --> 01:55:01,840
I don't know about the Welsh yet,

926
01:55:01,840 --> 01:55:03,840
but the Irish have landed!

927
01:55:03,840 --> 01:55:06,940
I had to see it before I could believe it.

928
01:55:06,940 --> 01:55:08,910
Why are the Irish fighting with the English?

929
01:55:08,910 --> 01:55:11,050
I wouldn't worry about them.

930
01:55:11,050 --> 01:55:14,920
Didn't I tell you before? It's my island.

931
01:55:14,920 --> 01:55:16,920
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh

932
01:55:16,920 --> 01:55:18,120
and assemble the council.

933
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:20,140
Order it.

934
01:55:24,430 --> 01:55:25,960
Your island?

935
01:55:25,960 --> 01:55:30,020
My island! Yup!

936
01:55:30,630 --> 01:55:31,900
No, please, gentlemen!

937
01:55:31,900 --> 01:55:34,370
Lords, Craig is right!

938
01:55:34,370 --> 01:55:37,130
This time our only option

939
01:55:38,570 --> 01:55:42,040
Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed to the ground...

940
01:55:46,920 --> 01:55:49,420
My army has marched for more days

941
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:50,720
than I can remember,

942
01:55:50,720 --> 01:55:53,190
and we still have preparations to make,

943
01:55:53,190 --> 01:55:55,420
so I'll make this plain.

944
01:55:55,420 --> 01:55:58,930
We require every soldier you can summon...

945
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:01,900
your personal escorts, even yourselves...

946
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:04,590
and we need them now.

947
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:07,440
With such a force arrayed against us,

948
01:56:07,440 --> 01:56:09,270
it's time to discuss other options.

949
01:56:09,270 --> 01:56:10,940
Other options?

950
01:56:10,940 --> 01:56:14,440
Don't you wish at least to lead your men

951
01:56:14,440 --> 01:56:15,940
onto the field

952
01:56:15,940 --> 01:56:19,340
and barter a better deal with Longshanks

953
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:21,350
Sire William...

954
01:56:21,350 --> 01:56:22,680
We can't defeat this army!

955
01:56:22,680 --> 01:56:23,920
We can!

956
01:56:23,920 --> 01:56:26,480
And we will!

957
01:56:27,960 --> 01:56:31,790
We won at Stirling...and still you quibble!

958
01:56:31,790 --> 01:56:34,960
We won at York, and you would not support us.

959
01:56:34,960 --> 01:56:37,470
If you'll not stand up with us now,

960
01:56:37,470 --> 01:56:39,870
then I say you're cowards.

961
01:56:44,170 --> 01:56:46,910
And if you're Scotsmen,

962
01:56:46,910 --> 01:56:49,410
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

963
01:56:49,410 --> 01:56:52,970
Please, Sire William, speak with me alone.

964
01:56:54,920 --> 01:56:57,280
I beg you.

965
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:02,420
Now, you've achieved more than anyone ever dreamed,

966
01:57:02,420 --> 01:57:03,930
but fighting these odds,

967
01:57:03,930 --> 01:57:06,430
it looks like rage, not courage.

968
01:57:06,430 --> 01:57:08,900
It's well beyond rage.

969
01:57:09,930 --> 01:57:12,400
Help me.

970
01:57:13,140 --> 01:57:17,410
In the name of Christ, help yourselves!

971
01:57:17,410 --> 01:57:19,410
Now is our chance. Now.

972
01:57:19,410 --> 01:57:21,740
If we join, we can win.

973
01:57:21,740 --> 01:57:25,950
If we win, we'll have what none of us ever had before...

974
01:57:25,950 --> 01:57:28,350
a country of our own.

975
01:57:29,450 --> 01:57:31,650
You're the rightful leader.

976
01:57:31,650 --> 01:57:35,420
And there is strength in you, I see it.

977
01:57:39,590 --> 01:57:41,580
Unite us.

978
01:57:43,300 --> 01:57:44,900
Unite us!

979
01:57:44,900 --> 01:57:47,660
Unite the clans.

980
01:57:53,940 --> 01:57:55,410
All right.

981
01:57:55,410 --> 01:57:57,810
Right.

982
01:58:01,420 --> 01:58:03,690
This cannot be the way.

983
01:58:03,690 --> 01:58:05,950
You said yourself...

984
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:10,430
the nobles will not support Wallace.

985
01:58:10,430 --> 01:58:13,330
So how did it help us

986
01:58:15,430 --> 01:58:18,330
I gave him my word.

987
01:58:25,440 --> 01:58:27,940
I know it is hard.

988
01:58:27,940 --> 01:58:31,100
Being a leader is.

989
01:58:31,750 --> 01:58:35,950
But, son... son...

990
01:58:35,950 --> 01:58:38,320
look at me.

991
01:58:44,630 --> 01:58:46,390
I cannot be king.

992
01:58:46,390 --> 01:58:49,970
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

993
01:58:49,970 --> 01:58:52,970
What I tell you, you must do.

994
01:58:52,970 --> 01:58:55,900
Not for me, not for yourself,

995
01:58:55,900 --> 01:58:58,800
for your country.

996
01:59:13,890 --> 01:59:15,390
lads, make way.

997
01:59:15,390 --> 01:59:18,290
Coming through here.

998
01:59:23,900 --> 01:59:26,300
Make way, lads.

999
01:59:30,910 --> 01:59:33,580
The Bruce is not coming, William.

1000
01:59:33,580 --> 01:59:36,270
He'll come.

1001
01:59:37,250 --> 01:59:40,610
Mornay and Lochlan have come.

1002
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:43,810
So will the Bruce.

1003
01:59:45,690 --> 01:59:50,430
Quite the lovely gathering.

1004
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:53,150
Wouldn't you agree?

1005
01:59:55,160 --> 01:59:57,300
The archers are ready, sire.

1006
01:59:57,300 --> 01:59:58,800
Not the archers.

1007
01:59:58,800 --> 02:00:03,200
My scouts tell me their archers are miles away

1008
02:00:04,310 --> 02:00:06,780
Arrows cost money. Use up the Irish.

1009
02:00:06,780 --> 02:00:08,080
The dead cost nothing.

1010
02:00:08,080 --> 02:00:11,280
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

1011
02:00:11,280 --> 02:00:12,780
Infantry!

1012
02:00:12,780 --> 02:00:13,820
Infantry!

1013
02:00:13,820 --> 02:00:14,820
Cavalry!

1014
02:00:14,820 --> 02:00:15,950
Cavalry!

1015
02:00:15,950 --> 02:00:18,350
Cavalry!

1016
02:00:18,890 --> 02:00:19,160
Advance!

1017
02:00:19,160 --> 02:00:22,210
Advance!

1018
02:01:45,370 --> 02:01:50,370
good to see you this morning!

1019
02:01:50,710 --> 02:01:53,480
Irish.

1020
02:01:53,480 --> 02:01:55,980
Glad to have you with us.

1021
02:01:55,980 --> 02:01:57,320
Watch this.

1022
02:04:06,080 --> 02:04:08,920
Mornay? Lochlan?

1023
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:12,720
I gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland

1024
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:17,430
Lochlan turned for much less.

1025
02:04:17,430 --> 02:04:18,930
Archers.

1026
02:04:18,930 --> 02:04:20,430
I beg pardon, sire.

1027
02:04:20,430 --> 02:04:23,520
Won't we hit our own troops?

1028
02:04:24,930 --> 02:04:26,440
Yes...

1029
02:04:26,440 --> 02:04:28,370
but we'll hit theirs as well.

1030
02:04:28,370 --> 02:04:31,140
We have reserves.

1031
02:04:31,140 --> 02:04:33,610
Attack!

1032
02:04:34,440 --> 02:04:35,640
Archers!

1033
02:04:35,640 --> 02:04:39,550
Archers  attack!

1034
02:04:43,550 --> 02:04:45,540
Loose!

1035
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:53,980
Loose!

1036
02:05:13,520 --> 02:05:15,920
Send in our reinforcements.

1037
02:05:16,320 --> 02:05:18,380
Send in the rest!

1038
02:05:27,830 --> 02:05:30,930
Bring me Wallace.

1039
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:32,940
Alive, if possible.

1040
02:05:32,940 --> 02:05:34,940
Dead... just as good.

1041
02:05:34,940 --> 02:05:37,610
Send us news of our victory.

1042
02:05:37,610 --> 02:05:40,540
Shall we retire?

1043
02:07:04,690 --> 02:07:07,250
Protect the king.

1044
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:11,490
Get up!

1045
02:09:11,490 --> 02:09:13,950
Get up!

1046
02:09:14,390 --> 02:09:16,060
Up!

1047
02:09:16,060 --> 02:09:18,290
Get up!

1048
02:09:18,360 --> 02:09:21,120
Get him out of here!

1049
02:09:24,970 --> 02:09:27,530
Go!

1050
02:10:26,600 --> 02:10:28,930
I'm dying.

1051
02:10:32,100 --> 02:10:34,400
Let me be.

1052
02:10:39,440 --> 02:10:41,440
No.

1053
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:44,750
You're going to live.

1054
02:10:44,750 --> 02:10:48,550
I've lived long enough to live free.

1055
02:10:48,550 --> 02:10:55,280
Proud to see you become the man you are.

1056
02:10:58,890 --> 02:11:01,920
I'm a happy man.

1057
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:52,870
I'm the one who's rotting,

1058
02:12:52,870 --> 02:12:57,640
but I think your face looks graver than mine.

1059
02:13:01,350 --> 02:13:03,780
Son...

1060
02:13:08,360 --> 02:13:11,760
we must have alliance with England

1061
02:13:13,100 --> 02:13:15,360
You achieved that.

1062
02:13:15,360 --> 02:13:16,870
You saved your family,

1063
02:13:16,870 --> 02:13:19,600
increased your land.

1064
02:13:19,600 --> 02:13:24,740
In time, you will have all the power in Scotland.

1065
02:13:24,740 --> 02:13:31,010
Lands, titles, men, power... nothing.

1066
02:13:31,010 --> 02:13:32,250
Nothing?

1067
02:13:32,250 --> 02:13:34,810
I have nothing.

1068
02:13:35,250 --> 02:13:36,750
Men fight for me...

1069
02:13:36,750 --> 02:13:39,890
because if they do not, I throw them off my land

1070
02:13:39,890 --> 02:13:43,290
and I starve their wives and their children.

1071
02:13:43,290 --> 02:13:49,330
Those men who bled the ground red at Falkirk...

1072
02:13:49,330 --> 02:13:51,330
they fought for William Wallace,

1073
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:56,030
and he fights for something that I've never had.

1074
02:13:56,710 --> 02:14:00,710
And I took it from him when I betrayed him,

1075
02:14:00,710 --> 02:14:04,710
and I saw it in his face on the battlefield,

1076
02:14:04,710 --> 02:14:06,720
and it's tearing me apart!

1077
02:14:06,720 --> 02:14:10,020
Well, all men betray, all lose heart.

1078
02:14:10,020 --> 02:14:13,710
I don't want to lose heart!

1079
02:14:15,860 --> 02:14:22,060
I want to believe...as he does.

1080
02:14:26,870 --> 02:14:31,270
I will never be on the wrong side again.

1081
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:22,790
No!

1082
02:16:18,110 --> 02:16:21,420
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

1083
02:16:21,420 --> 02:16:26,520
Aye. Wallace rode into his bedchamber and killed him.

1084
02:16:26,520 --> 02:16:29,520
More a liability now than ever he was.

1085
02:16:29,520 --> 02:16:33,760
And there's no telling who'll be next.

1086
02:16:34,360 --> 02:16:36,890
Maybe you.

1087
02:16:38,100 --> 02:16:40,570
Maybe me.

1088
02:16:45,310 --> 02:16:48,070
It doesn't matter.

1089
02:16:48,980 --> 02:16:50,480
I'm serious, Robert.

1090
02:16:50,480 --> 02:16:52,880
So am I!

1091
02:17:07,230 --> 02:17:10,890
Search the place!

1092
02:17:12,800 --> 02:17:14,890
Lochlan.

1093
02:17:20,940 --> 02:17:23,850
William Wallace killed 50 men.

1094
02:17:23,850 --> 02:17:26,350
50 if it was one.

1095
02:17:26,350 --> 02:17:27,580
100 men...

1096
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:29,080
with his own sword.

1097
02:17:29,080 --> 02:17:30,990
Cut through them like...

1098
02:17:30,990 --> 02:17:35,150
Moses through the Red Sea.

1099
02:18:06,320 --> 02:18:09,020
His legend grows.

1100
02:18:09,020 --> 02:18:11,860
It will be worse than before.

1101
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:14,860
He rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town,

1102
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:16,830
and when he replenishes his numbers...

1103
02:18:16,830 --> 02:18:20,270
They're sheep! Mere sheep!

1104
02:18:21,000 --> 02:18:24,570
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

1105
02:18:24,570 --> 02:18:26,340
Very well.

1106
02:18:26,340 --> 02:18:29,840
Pick a flock of your finest assassins

1107
02:18:29,840 --> 02:18:32,240
and set a meeting.

1108
02:18:34,680 --> 02:18:38,240
for his ability to smell an ambush.

1109
02:18:39,850 --> 02:18:43,790
If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct,

1110
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:45,790
he warmed to our future queen.

1111
02:18:45,790 --> 02:18:48,590
He would trust her.

1112
02:18:49,260 --> 02:18:51,630
So we'll dispatch her with the notion

1113
02:18:51,630 --> 02:18:53,030
that she comes in peace.

1114
02:18:53,030 --> 02:18:55,900
Milord, the princess might be taken hostage

1115
02:18:55,900 --> 02:18:58,310
or her life be put in jeopardy.

1116
02:18:58,310 --> 02:19:01,980
my son would be most distressed by that.

1117
02:19:01,980 --> 02:19:05,680
but in truth, if she were to be killed,

1118
02:19:05,680 --> 02:19:09,580
we would soon find the king of France

1119
02:19:09,580 --> 02:19:12,750
a useful ally against the Scots.

1120
02:19:13,520 --> 02:19:16,830
You see, as king,

1121
02:19:16,830 --> 02:19:22,790
you must find the good in any situation.

1122
02:19:47,890 --> 02:19:50,730
It's William Wallace, sure.

1123
02:19:50,730 --> 02:19:53,630
He's giving up his sword.

1124
02:19:53,630 --> 02:19:55,560
Be ready.

1125
02:21:33,330 --> 02:21:35,730
Milady...

1126
02:21:39,330 --> 02:21:42,300
I received your message.

1127
02:21:54,350 --> 02:21:56,850
This is...the second time

1128
02:21:56,850 --> 02:21:59,480
you've warned me of danger.

1129
02:22:00,960 --> 02:22:02,460
Why?

1130
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:05,360
There will be a new shipment of supplies

1131
02:22:05,360 --> 02:22:08,530
coming north next month...foods and weapons.

1132
02:22:08,530 --> 02:22:11,870
No, stop.

1133
02:22:11,870 --> 02:22:15,030
Why do you help me?

1134
02:22:19,870 --> 02:22:23,410
Why do you help me?

1135
02:22:23,410 --> 02:22:28,210
Because of the way you are looking at me now.

1136
02:24:18,730 --> 02:24:21,360
Just when we thought all hope was lost,

1137
02:24:21,360 --> 02:24:25,200
our noble saviors have arrived.

1138
02:24:26,300 --> 02:24:29,700
Off with their...hoods.

1139
02:24:33,810 --> 02:24:36,610
Sire William, we've come to seek a meeting.

1140
02:24:36,610 --> 02:24:39,310
Well, what's the point?

1141
02:24:39,310 --> 02:24:41,650
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1142
02:24:41,650 --> 02:24:44,350
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1143
02:24:44,350 --> 02:24:47,190
Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.

1144
02:24:47,190 --> 02:24:49,390
So let the council swear publicly.

1145
02:24:49,390 --> 02:24:53,330
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1146
02:24:53,330 --> 02:24:55,830
Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.

1147
02:24:55,830 --> 02:24:57,800
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1148
02:24:57,800 --> 02:24:59,330
Meet us two days from now.

1149
02:24:59,330 --> 02:25:01,840
Pledge us your pardon, and we'll unite behind you.

1150
02:25:01,840 --> 02:25:03,340
Scotland will be one.

1151
02:25:03,340 --> 02:25:05,740
One? You mean us and you.

1152
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:08,580
No.

1153
02:25:08,580 --> 02:25:11,270
I mean this.

1154
02:25:12,680 --> 02:25:15,980
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1155
02:25:24,690 --> 02:25:26,830
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

1156
02:25:26,830 --> 02:25:28,800
If the Bruce wanted to kill you,

1157
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:31,230
he'd have done it at Falkirk.

1158
02:25:31,570 --> 02:25:34,370
I know. I saw.

1159
02:25:34,370 --> 02:25:36,800
Leave him aside. What about the others?

1160
02:25:36,800 --> 02:25:38,540
Nest of scheming bastards!

1161
02:25:38,540 --> 02:25:40,810
They couldn't agree on the color of shite!

1162
02:25:40,810 --> 02:25:42,480
It's a trap. Are you blind?

1163
02:25:42,480 --> 02:25:44,810
Look at us.

1164
02:25:44,810 --> 02:25:46,810
We've got to try.

1165
02:25:46,810 --> 02:25:49,320
We can't do this alone.

1166
02:25:49,320 --> 02:25:51,820
Joining the nobles is the only hope for our people.

1167
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:54,460
You know what happens if we don't take that chance?

1168
02:25:54,460 --> 02:25:55,660
What?

1169
02:25:55,660 --> 02:25:57,680
Nothing.

1170
02:25:58,760 --> 02:26:01,330
I don't want to be a martyr.

1171
02:26:01,330 --> 02:26:03,330
Nor I. I want to live.

1172
02:26:03,330 --> 02:26:06,330
I want a home and children and peace.

1173
02:26:06,330 --> 02:26:08,200
Do you?

1174
02:26:08,200 --> 02:26:09,840
Aye, I do.

1175
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:11,840
I've asked God for those things.

1176
02:26:11,840 --> 02:26:14,180
It's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.

1177
02:26:14,180 --> 02:26:16,510
That's just a dream, William.

1178
02:26:16,510 --> 02:26:18,350
A dream? Just a...

1179
02:26:18,350 --> 02:26:22,280
then what have we been doing all this time?

1180
02:26:22,280 --> 02:26:24,050
We've lived that dream.

1181
02:26:24,050 --> 02:26:26,290
Your dream isn't about freedom.

1182
02:26:26,290 --> 02:26:27,960
It's about Murron.

1183
02:26:27,960 --> 02:26:31,390
Your dream is to be a hero 'cause you think she sees you.

1184
02:26:31,390 --> 02:26:34,730
I don't think she sees me. I know she does.

1185
02:26:34,730 --> 02:26:37,590
And your father sees you, too.

1186
02:26:46,970 --> 02:26:49,840
Jesus.

1187
02:26:49,840 --> 02:26:54,210
Get up. Give us your hand.

1188
02:26:55,280 --> 02:26:58,050
Shall I come with you?

1189
02:26:59,290 --> 02:27:02,490
No. I'll go alone.

1190
02:27:02,490 --> 02:27:05,490
I'll see you after.

1191
02:27:05,490 --> 02:27:07,980
Right.

1192
02:27:11,300 --> 02:27:15,790
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1193
02:27:20,810 --> 02:27:22,240
He won't come.

1194
02:27:22,240 --> 02:27:23,740
He will.

1195
02:27:23,740 --> 02:27:26,640
I know he will.

1196
02:27:38,760 --> 02:27:42,660
Milord, he approaches!

1197
02:28:26,070 --> 02:28:29,010
No!

1198
02:28:32,850 --> 02:28:34,750
Stay out of it, Robert!

1199
02:28:34,750 --> 02:28:38,980
You lied! You lied!

1200
02:28:41,760 --> 02:28:45,990
Bruce is not to be hurt! That's the arrangement!

1201
02:28:52,770 --> 02:28:55,260
Father!

1202
02:29:00,410 --> 02:29:03,340
You rotting bastard!

1203
02:29:03,340 --> 02:29:07,680
Why? Why?

1204
02:29:10,280 --> 02:29:13,790
Longshanks acquired Wallace.

1205
02:29:13,790 --> 02:29:15,460
So did our nobles.

1206
02:29:15,460 --> 02:29:18,290
That was the price of your crown.

1207
02:29:18,290 --> 02:29:21,800
Die!

1208
02:29:21,800 --> 02:29:23,500
I want you to die!

1209
02:29:23,500 --> 02:29:28,370
Soon enough I'll be dead, and you'll be king.

1210
02:29:28,370 --> 02:29:31,310
I don't want anything from you.

1211
02:29:31,310 --> 02:29:33,810
You're not a man!

1212
02:29:33,810 --> 02:29:36,500
You're not my father.

1213
02:29:39,810 --> 02:29:44,490
You're my son, and you've always known my mind.

1214
02:29:44,490 --> 02:29:47,890
You deceived me.

1215
02:29:47,890 --> 02:29:49,890
You let yourself be deceived.

1216
02:29:49,890 --> 02:29:55,730
In your heart, you always knew what had to happen here.

1217
02:29:57,330 --> 02:30:01,790
Thus, you know what it means to hate.

1218
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:08,340
Now you're ready to be a king.

1219
02:30:08,340 --> 02:30:14,940
My hate will die...with you.

1220
02:30:18,350 --> 02:30:20,860
William Wallace,

1221
02:30:20,860 --> 02:30:23,660
you stand in taint of high treason.

1222
02:30:23,660 --> 02:30:25,990
Against whom?

1223
02:30:25,990 --> 02:30:28,800
Against your king.

1224
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:30,870
Have you anything to say?

1225
02:30:30,870 --> 02:30:35,800
Never in my whole life...

1226
02:30:35,800 --> 02:30:38,170
did I swear allegiance to him.

1227
02:30:38,170 --> 02:30:43,510
It matters not. He is your king.

1228
02:30:44,710 --> 02:30:48,320
Confess, and you may receive a quick death.

1229
02:30:48,320 --> 02:30:51,950
Deny, and you must be purified by pain.

1230
02:30:51,950 --> 02:30:54,960
Do you confess?

1231
02:30:54,960 --> 02:30:59,720
Do you confess?

1232
02:31:04,330 --> 02:31:06,330
Then on the morrow,

1233
02:31:06,330 --> 02:31:08,960
you shall receive your purification.

1234
02:31:19,850 --> 02:31:21,350
Your Highness.

1235
02:31:21,350 --> 02:31:22,780
I will see the prisoner.

1236
02:31:22,780 --> 02:31:24,790
We've got orders from the king...

1237
02:31:24,790 --> 02:31:26,790
The king will be dead in a month.

1238
02:31:26,790 --> 02:31:28,290
His son is a weakling.

1239
02:31:28,290 --> 02:31:30,290
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

1240
02:31:30,290 --> 02:31:31,790
Now open this door.

1241
02:31:31,790 --> 02:31:35,190
Majesty.

1242
02:31:40,370 --> 02:31:42,500
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

1243
02:31:42,500 --> 02:31:43,970
Stop it!

1244
02:31:43,970 --> 02:31:46,470
Leave me.

1245
02:31:46,470 --> 02:31:49,670
I said, leave me!

1246
02:32:00,820 --> 02:32:02,860
Milady.

1247
02:32:02,860 --> 02:32:09,730
Sire, I come to beg you...

1248
02:32:10,330 --> 02:32:13,330
to confess all and swear allegiance to the king

1249
02:32:13,330 --> 02:32:15,400
that he might show you mercy.

1250
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:18,170
Will he show mercy to my country?

1251
02:32:18,170 --> 02:32:21,340
Mercy is to die quickly,

1252
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:24,280
perhaps even live in a tower.

1253
02:32:24,280 --> 02:32:27,280
In time, who knows what can happen...

1254
02:32:27,280 --> 02:32:30,340
if you can only live?

1255
02:32:34,290 --> 02:32:37,290
If I swear to him,

1256
02:32:37,290 --> 02:32:41,450
then all that I am is dead already.

1257
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:52,270
You will die. It will be awful.

1258
02:32:52,270 --> 02:32:55,210
Every man dies.

1259
02:32:56,810 --> 02:32:59,640
Not every man really lives.

1260
02:33:05,990 --> 02:33:07,820
Drink this.

1261
02:33:07,820 --> 02:33:10,320
It will dull your pain.

1262
02:33:10,320 --> 02:33:13,190
No. It will numb my wits.

1263
02:33:13,190 --> 02:33:15,830
I must have them all.

1264
02:33:15,830 --> 02:33:17,830
For if I'm senseless, or if I wail,

1265
02:33:17,830 --> 02:33:21,340
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1266
02:33:21,340 --> 02:33:24,270
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1267
02:33:24,270 --> 02:33:26,800
Take it.

1268
02:33:30,640 --> 02:33:33,130
All right.

1269
02:34:19,130 --> 02:34:24,700
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.

1270
02:34:24,700 --> 02:34:28,940
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1271
02:34:28,940 --> 02:34:31,770
I respect him.

1272
02:34:33,210 --> 02:34:35,540
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1273
02:34:35,540 --> 02:34:37,440
Show mercy, O thou great king,

1274
02:34:37,440 --> 02:34:40,610
and win the respect of your own people.

1275
02:34:49,220 --> 02:34:55,790
Even now...you are incapable of mercy.

1276
02:35:00,730 --> 02:35:03,130
And you...

1277
02:35:06,740 --> 02:35:09,940
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1278
02:35:09,940 --> 02:35:12,750
Before he lost his powers of speech,

1279
02:35:12,750 --> 02:35:15,250
he told me his one comfort was that

1280
02:35:15,250 --> 02:35:18,480
he would live to know Wallace was dead.

1281
02:35:36,700 --> 02:35:39,710
You see...

1282
02:35:39,710 --> 02:35:43,110
death comes to us all.

1283
02:35:51,450 --> 02:35:55,220
But before it comes to you,

1284
02:35:55,220 --> 02:35:57,730
know this...

1285
02:35:57,730 --> 02:36:01,730
Your blood dies with you.

1286
02:36:01,730 --> 02:36:06,630
A child who is not of your line grows in my belly.

1287
02:36:08,740 --> 02:36:13,330
Your son will not sit long on the throne, I swear it.

1288
02:36:49,710 --> 02:36:52,610
I'm so afraid.

1289
02:36:59,720 --> 02:37:05,120
Give me the strength...to die well.

1290
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:31,380
Here he comes!

1291
02:38:58,240 --> 02:39:02,540
Now behold the awful price of treason!

1292
02:39:08,720 --> 02:39:11,480
You will fall to your knees now.

1293
02:39:12,550 --> 02:39:16,220
Declare yourself the king's loyal subject

1294
02:39:16,220 --> 02:39:19,820
and beg his mercy.

1295
02:39:25,730 --> 02:39:28,130
And you shall have it.

1296
02:39:37,740 --> 02:39:40,470
Rope!

1297
02:40:02,640 --> 02:40:04,900
Stretch him!

1298
02:40:46,850 --> 02:40:50,010
Pleasant... yes?

1299
02:40:51,790 --> 02:40:53,290
Rise to your knees,

1300
02:40:53,290 --> 02:40:57,260
kiss the royal emblem on my cloak,

1301
02:40:57,260 --> 02:40:59,820
and you will feel no more.

1302
02:41:40,730 --> 02:41:43,670
Rack him!

1303
02:42:36,999 --> 02:42:39,399
Enough?

1304
02:43:31,489 --> 02:43:34,989
It can all end right now.

1305
02:43:34,989 --> 02:43:37,479
Peace...

1306
02:43:40,499 --> 02:43:42,199
Just say it.

1307
02:43:42,199 --> 02:43:47,069
Cry out... mercy.

1308
02:43:56,009 --> 02:43:57,549
Mercy!

1309
02:43:57,549 --> 02:44:01,949
Mercy! Mercy!

1310
02:44:05,559 --> 02:44:06,719
Cry out.

1311
02:44:06,719 --> 02:44:10,819
Mercy! Mercy!

1312
02:44:13,399 --> 02:44:14,729
Just say it...

1313
02:44:14,729 --> 02:44:17,399
mercy.

1314
02:44:17,399 --> 02:44:21,489
Mercy! Mercy!

1315
02:44:39,759 --> 02:44:41,989
Mercy, William.

1316
02:44:41,989 --> 02:44:45,819
Mercy. Jesus, now say it.

1317
02:44:50,669 --> 02:44:54,199
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1318
02:44:54,199 --> 02:44:56,839
Mercy! Mercy!

1319
02:44:56,839 --> 02:44:59,709
Mercy!

1320
02:45:14,019 --> 02:45:24,299
Freeeedoooom!!

1321
02:47:08,199 --> 02:47:12,009
After the beheading,

1322
02:47:12,009 --> 02:47:16,909
William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.

1323
02:47:18,009 --> 02:47:21,019
His head was set on London Bridge,

1324
02:47:21,019 --> 02:47:27,959
his arms and legs sent to the four corners of Britain

1325
02:47:27,959 --> 02:47:29,959
as a warning.

1326
02:47:29,959 --> 02:47:34,959
It did not have the effect that Longshanks planned.

1327
02:47:34,959 --> 02:47:39,469
And l... Robert the Bruce...

1328
02:47:39,469 --> 02:47:44,769
rode out topay homage to the armies of the English king

1329
02:47:44,769 --> 02:47:48,109
and accept his endorsement of my crown.

1330
02:47:48,109 --> 02:47:50,749
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.

1331
02:47:50,749 --> 02:47:55,479
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1332
02:48:22,649 --> 02:48:26,809
Come. Let's get it over with.

1333
02:48:36,959 --> 02:48:39,319
Stop!

1334
02:48:56,479 --> 02:48:59,809
You have bled with Wallace!

1335
02:49:05,489 --> 02:49:07,959
Now bleed with me.

1336
02:49:47,699 --> 02:49:50,429
Wallace! Wallace!

1337
02:49:50,429 --> 02:49:51,569
Wallace!

1338
02:49:51,569 --> 02:49:52,669
Wallace!

1339
02:49:52,669 --> 02:49:53,799
Wallace!

1340
02:49:53,799 --> 02:49:56,739
Wallace!

1341
02:50:14,559 --> 02:50:17,559
In the year of our Lord, 1314,

1342
02:50:17,559 --> 02:50:21,559
patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered,

1343
02:50:21,559 --> 02:50:25,999
charged the fields of Bannockburn.

1344
02:50:25,999 --> 02:50:29,009
They fought like warrior poets,

1345
02:50:29,009 --> 02:50:32,009
they fought like Scotsmen...

1346
02:50:32,009 --> 02:50:34,909
and won their freedom
