1
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:47,182
【 勇 敢 的 心 】

2
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:43,502
我要说威廉华莱士的事迹
I shall tell you of William Wallace.

3
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,370
英国史学界会认为我是骗子
Historians from England will say I am a liar.

4
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:51,811
但历史是由崇拜英雄者所撰写
But history is written by
those who have hanged heroes.

5
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:55,709
苏格兰国王驾崩时未留子嗣
The King of Scotland had died without a son.

6
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,650
而英格兰国王…
And the King of England,

7
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:01,383
残酷的异教徒长脚爱德华
a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks,

8
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:04,516
自封为苏格兰国王
claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.

9
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:08,256
苏格兰贵族与他宣战
Scotland's nobles fought him

10
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:10,959
亦彼此互相交战，争夺王位
and fought each other over the crown.

11
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:15,503
长脚邀他们共商休战
So Longshanks invited
them to talks of a truce.

12
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:19,006
不携武器，只准一名侍随
No weapons. One page only.

13
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:25,872
农民代表是麦肯华莱士
One farmer of that shire was Malcolm Wallace,

14
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:28,450
他有自己的土地，两个儿子
a commoner with his own
lands. He had two sons:

15
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:30,644
约翰与威廉
John and William.

16
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:39,487
我叫你留在家中
I told you to stay.

17
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,929
我做完事了，我们去哪？
Well, I finished my work. Where are we going?

18
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,093
麦安祖家，聚会结束后拜访
MacAndrews'. He was supposed
to visit after the gathering.

19
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:47,965
我也去
Can I come?

20
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:50,835
- 回家
- 我想去
- No. Go home, boy.
- But I want to go.

21
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,465
回家，否则我打你
Go home, or you'll feel the back of my hand.

22
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,435
回家，威廉
Away hame, William.

23
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:21,569
麦安祖
MacAndrews.

24
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:27,808
麦安祖

25
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,677
天啊！
Holy Jesus.

26
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:25,530
别慌，别慌
William.

27
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:31,505
冷静点，孩子
It's all right, it's all right. Easy, lad.

28
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,283
威廉
William.

29
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,296
我说我们打回去
And I say we hit back now.

30
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:55,864
华莱士说得对
Wallace is right.

31
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,733
我们打回去
We fight them.

32
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:02,202
贵族们聚会后决定奋战
Every nobleman willing to
fight was at that meeting.

33
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,772
我们打不过军队
We cannot beat an army.

34
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:05,636
征召不了五十人来参战
Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.

35
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,733
我们不用打败他们
We do not have to beat them...

36
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,571
只要与他们对抗
Just fight them.

37
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,837
谁要与我出战？
Now, who's with me?

38
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:12,642
我，华莱士
I am, Wallace.

39
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:15,450
好
All right.

40
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:33,001
你要去哪里？
Where do you think you're going?

41
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:34,501
跟你走
With you.

42
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:36,331
你要跟我走？
Och, are ye?

43
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,737
你能做什么？
And what are you going to do?

44
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,102
我能帮你
I'm gonna help.

45
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,907
你会更需要帮助
And a good help you'll be, too.

46
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:48,914
我需要你照顾这里
But I need you to stay here and look
after the place for me while I'm away.

47
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,182
我也能打仗
I can fight.

48
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,758
我知道
I know.

49
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:59,084
我知道你能打仗
I know you can fight.

50
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:07,461
但是智慧才是英雄的本色
But it's our wits that make us men.

51
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,571
明天见
See ye tomorrow.

52
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,840
- English.
- Get down.

53
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,178
在你父亲及兄长离开后
With your father and brother gone,

54
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,246
他们会来斩尽杀绝，烧尽农舍
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

55
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:53,577
要全靠我们了，汉密
It's up to us, Hamish.

56
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,246
爹？
Da?

57
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:07,982
爹？

58
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,162
威廉
William.

59
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,695
过来，孩子
Come here, lad.

60
00:10:57,426 --> 00:11:00,020
阿们

61
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:54,935
威廉
William.

62
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,376
我是你叔叔
I'm your uncle.

63
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:00,380
亚盖
Argyle.

64
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:14,696
你很像你母亲
You have the look of your mother.

65
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:27,940
今晚留在此
We'll stay here tonight.

66
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:30,312
明天你跟我回家
Tomorrow, you'll come home with me.

67
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,408
我不想离开
I don't want to leave.

68
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,948
你也不想你父亲去世
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?

69
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,745
但最终仍是发生了
But it happened.

70
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:45,659
神父的祭文有意义吧？
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

71
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:47,492
上帝保佑你…
The Lord bless thee and keep thee...

72
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,564
他说拉丁文
It was in Latin.

73
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,563
你会说拉丁文？
You don't speak Latin?

74
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:56,763
那是我们该要注意练习
That's something we shall have to remedy.

75
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,538
“上帝”
The Lord

76
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,871
“保佑你、看守你”
bless thee and keep thee.

77
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:07,243
“上帝将光照引在你身上”
The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.

78
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,350
“上帝抬起k的颜面看着你”
The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee

79
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,213
“赐你平安”
and give thee peace.

80
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,051
“阿们”
Amen.

81
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,861
你有一颗自由的心
Your heart is free.

82
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:27,700
要有勇气去追寻
Have the courage to follow it.

83
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:55,894
他们在做什么？
What are they doing?

84
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,063
依他们特有的方式道别
Saying goodbye in their own way.

85
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:03,971
奏着亡命曲调、吹着亡命箫
Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

86
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:16,477
我与你父亲
It was the same for me and your daddy

87
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:19,310
也同在我们父亲丧命时吹奏过
when our father was killed.

88
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:49,448
你首先要学会用…
First, learn to use...

89
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:51,110
这个
this.

90
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:54,718
然后我会教你用…
Then I'll teach you... to use

91
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,618
这个
this.

92
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,143
伦敦

93
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:27,715
多年后
Many years later,

94
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:30,223
长脚爱德华为他的长子证婚
Edward the Longshanks, King of England,

95
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,851
也同名爱德华
supervised the wedding of his eldest son,

96
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:35,795
他将承袭他的王位
who would succeed him as king.

97
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:40,094
阿们
Amen.

98
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:46,942
至于长子的新娘
As bride for his son,

99
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:52,480
长脚选了劲敌法国王室
Longshanks had chosen the daughter
of his rival, the King of France.

100
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:19,399
当时谣言四起，为使公主受孕
It was widely whispered that
for the Princess to conceive,

101
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:22,909
长脚得由自己代劳
Longshanks would have to
do the honors himself.

102
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:27,711
那是他心存已久的邪念
That may have been what
he had in mind all along.

103
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,712
苏格兰
Scotland...

104
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:35,516
我的土地
My land.

105
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:42,189
法国人会对强者趋炎附势
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength.

106
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:44,697
但若我们无法统一各岛
But how will they believe our strength

107
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,633
他们又如何相信我们是强者
when we cannot rule the whole of our island?

108
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,046
我儿子呢？
Where is my son?

109
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:01,713
对不起，吾王
Your pardon, my Lord.

110
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,808
他要我来代表
He asked me to come in his stead.

111
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:07,184
我召唤他，他却派来
I sent for him and he sends you?

112
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:09,285
要我离开吗？吾王
Shall I leave, my Lord?

113
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:14,592
他要女皇在我驾崩后统治天下
If he wants his queen to rule when I am gone,

114
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:16,995
请…留下
then by all means stay

115
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,363
学习如何统治
and learn how. Please.

116
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:25,068
贵族
Nobles.

117
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,971
贵族是开启苏格兰大门之钥
Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

118
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:32,603
将北方的土地赐给我们的贵族
Grant our nobles lands in the North.

119
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:36,412
将这里的土地赐给英格兰贵族
Give their nobles estates here in England.

120
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:39,453
让他们为贪婪而不与我们对立
And make them too greedy to oppose us.

121
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:41,887
但我们的贵族不愿意迁移
But, sir, our nobles will
be reluctant to uproot.

122
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,390
新的土地代表新税项
New lands mean new taxes

123
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:46,461
他们在法国时己因战事征税
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.

124
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:50,760
有吗？
Are they?

125
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,817
苏格兰的问题…
The trouble with Scotland

126
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,946
在于太多的苏格兰人存在
is that it's full of Scots.

127
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:24,095
也许该是改旧税收法令的时候
Perhaps the time has come to
reinstitute an old custom.

128
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:27,600
应允他们初夜权
Grant them primae noctis.

129
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,535
初夜权
First night.

130
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,805
当平民儿女因婚姻而继承土地
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

131
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:41,042
贵族有权在新婚夜占有她
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding.

132
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:45,184
若赶不走他们
If we can't get them out,

133
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:48,819
就让他们盈满为患
we'll breed them out.

134
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:53,188
这是我们统治苏格兰的宗旨
That should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to Scotland.

135
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,627
征税或不征税
Taxes or no taxes?

136
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:57,528
真是好主意，大人
A most excellent idea, sire.

137
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,032
是吗？
Is it?

138
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,100
爱丁堡

139
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:05,637
在爱丁堡
Now, in Edinburgh

140
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:08,904
在议会聚集了苏格兰的贵族
were gathered the council of Scottish nobles.

141
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,477
其中一个是罗拔
Among these was Robert,

142
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,673
布鲁士伯爵十七世
the 17th Earl of Bruce,

143
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:16,976
争夺苏格兰王位的头号人物
a leading contender for
the crown of Scotland.

144
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:21,712
你认为是否属实？

145
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,151
我看到了
I hear that

146
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,659
听说长脚已应允了初夜权
Longshanks has granted primae noctis.

147
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:30,221
很显然会引他的支持者来此
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

148
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,131
我父亲深信
My father believes we must

149
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:35,893
要增加他的信心…
lull Longshanks into our confidence

150
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:38,268
不是支持他就是违抗他的法令
by neither supporting his
decree nor opposing it.

151
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:39,567
好计划
A wise plan.

152
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,934
你父亲如何？
How is your father? He missed the council.

153
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:44,877
他处理政事在法国滞留
His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

154
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:52,111
但他来信致意
But he sends his greetings.

155
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:55,256
让我为全布鲁士家族
And he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces

156
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:57,049
及所有的苏格兰人代言
and for Scotland.

157
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:11,354
你的石头掉了
You've dropped your rock.

158
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,087
这是男人的挑战
A test of manhood.

159
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:16,023
你赢了
You win.

160
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,294
那就称为军人的考验
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

161
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:22,866
英格兰人不让我们用武器
The English won't let us train with weapons,

162
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:24,538
我们用石头来训练
so we use stones.

163
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,040
要考验军人不是以臂力来衡量
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.

164
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:28,474
是衡量这里
It's here.

165
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:29,601
不
No.

166
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:31,134
是这里
It's here.

167
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,282
汉密
Hamish?

168
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:53,866
拿去吧，孩子
Here you go, son.

169
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:55,163
加油！
Show him how.

170
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:01,875
Come on.

171
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:15,450
扔的好
That's a good throw.

172
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,517
的确
Aye. Aye, it was.

173
00:24:19,027 --> 00:24:21,962
我在想什么时候用得着？
I was wondering if you could
do that when it matters.

174
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,331
当作战的时候
As it... as it matters in battle.

175
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:31,537
你能扔人吗？
Could you crush a man with that throw?

176
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:34,833
我可以把你打烂
I could crush you... like a worm.

177
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:37,809
你能吗？
You could?

178
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:39,346
能
Aye.

179
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:40,748
那试试吧
Well, then, do it.

180
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,783
你们要看他扔我吗？
Like to see him crush me like a worm?

181
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:48,685
扔啊
Come and do it.

182
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,484
你会动
You'll move.

183
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:50,717
我不动
I will not.

184
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:52,615
好
Right.

185
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:54,389
表演的好
He'll move.

186
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,558
Come on there, boy.

187
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,140
做得好
Well done.

188
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,687
没事吧？你好像站不稳
Are you all right? You look a wee bit shaky.

189
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:31,432
我该记得扔石头的日子
I should have remembered the rocks.

190
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,531
Get up, you big heap of...

191
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,309
很高兴再见到你
It's good to see ye again.

192
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,843
是，欢迎归来
Aye, welcome home.

193
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:50,139
- Look what you did to my head.
- You should have moved.

194
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:02,593
威廉，与我跳舞好吗？
William, will you dance with me?

195
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:05,693
当然好
Of course I will.

196
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:34,456
我来征享我的初夜权
I've come to claim the
right of primae noctis.

197
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:40,399
我以占有新娘的初夜
As lord of these lands, I will bless this
marriage by taking the bride into my bed

198
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:42,834
作为对这婚姻的祝福
on the first night of her union.

199
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:44,769
天！不可以
By God you will not!

200
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:51,907
这是我的贵族权利
It is my noble right.

201
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:53,926
晚安
Good evening, sir.

202
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,730
你好，小华莱士
Ah, young Wallace.

203
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:57,996
很宜人的晚上
A grand soft evening.

204
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,768
的确是
Aye, it's that.

205
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:02,409
我能与您女儿谈谈吗？
Might I have a word with your daughter?

206
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,804
谈什么？
What do you want to have a word about?

207
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:09,415
茉朗
Murron,

208
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:12,111
想与我骑马吗？
would you like to ride with
me on this fine evening?

209
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:16,985
骑这？你疯了
In this? You're out of your mind.

210
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,753
是苏格兰的好天气
It's good Scottish weather, madam.

211
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,829
这微雨飘在脸旁
The rain is falling almost straight down.

212
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,158
她不能去
She cannae go with you.

213
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:24,627
不
No?

214
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,892
现在不行
No the now, anyway.

215
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:28,627
现在不行
- No the now.
- No the now.

216
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:30,004
再见
We'll see ye later.

217
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:32,471
天气还好，不会下雨
The weather's fine. It's hardly raining.

218
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,371
茉朗，她走了
Did you no hear what I said? Murron.

219
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:41,648
她个性真像你
It's you she takes after.

220
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,645
怎么认出我的？
How did you know me after so long?

221
00:30:13,882 --> 00:30:15,076
我没有
I didn't.

222
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:18,584
我看到你在看我，不知道是你
I saw you staring at me and
I didn't know who you were.

223
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,846
抱歉，我是在看
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

224
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,526
习惯跟陌生人在雨中骑马？
Are you in the habit of
riding off with strangers?

225
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:28,787
这是让你离开的好方法
It was the best way to make you leave.

226
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,965
若我能再鼓起勇气来约
If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,

227
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,367
我会先写信
I'll warn you in writing first.

228
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:38,439
没用的，我不识字
It wouldn't help. I can't read.

229
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,633
- 不识字？
- 不懂
- Can ye not?
- No.

230
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:46,139
那是我们该学习的
That's something we shall have to remedy.

231
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,441
你会教我读书？
You'll teach me to read?

232
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,982
只要愿意
Aye, if you like.

233
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:52,178
- 愿意
- 哪种语言？
- Aye.
- In what language?

234
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:55,055
不可一世
You're showing off now.

235
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:56,316
加深印象了吧？
That's right. Are you impressed yet?

236
00:30:56,424 --> 00:30:58,449
没有，我要吗？
No. Should I be?

237
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:04,423
因为每天我都会想

238
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:10,033
倒立着讲，我印象会更深刻
Do that standing on your
head, and I'll be impressed.

239
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:12,499
我裙子会飞起来，不过我会试
My kilt'll fly up, but I'll try.

240
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,631
你在旅行时没好好学礼貌
You learnt no manners on your travels.

241
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:17,540
法国人和罗马人礼貌更差
The French and the Romans
are far worse than I.

242
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:18,543
你去过罗马？
You went to Rome?

243
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:20,546
有，叔叔带我去朝圣
Uncle took me on a pilgrimage.

244
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:22,147
怎么样？
What was it like?

245
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,676
没美

246
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,452
什么意思？
What does that mean?

247
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:31,758
很美
Beautiful.

248
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,223
但我属于这里
But I belong here.

249
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:11,897
茉朗，进来
Murron, Come in now.

250
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:27,071
我知道昨晚邀茉朗很冒昧
Sir, I know it was strange of me to
invite Murron to ride last night, but...

251
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:28,904
那是另一回事
MacClannough's daughter is another matter.

252
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:32,036
我们要去参加会议
I've come to fetch you to a meeting.

253
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:34,881
什么会议？
What kind of meeting?

254
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:36,041
秘密会议
The secret kind.

255
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,414
会议是无用的
Your meetings are a waste of time.

256
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,386
你父亲是战士
Your father was a fighter

257
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:44,885
也是爱国者
and a patriot.

258
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:48,887
我知道他的为人
I know who my father was.

259
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:54,430
我回家是要种田、成家
I came home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

260
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,697
只要能平安生活，我愿意的
If I can live in peace, I will.

261
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,606
你想远离麻烦
You want to stay out of the troubles?

262
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,675
对
Aye.

263
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:04,108
证明了，你就可以娶茉朗
If you can prove it, you
may court my daughter.

264
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:06,879
在你能证明前，我不同意
Until you prove it, the answer is no.

265
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,039
不同意？
No.

266
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:10,276
不同意，华莱士
No, Wallace. No.

267
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:11,543
我刚证明了
Didn't I just prove it?

268
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,679
还没有
- No. No!
- No?

269
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:59,665
耕种很繁忙的
Of course, running a farm is a lot of work.

270
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,392
等我两个儿子来临时就会改变
But that will all change when my sons arrive.

271
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:05,670
你有小孩？
So, you've got children.

272
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,838
还没
Well, not yet.

273
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:09,466
但我希望能帮我
But I was hoping that you
could help me with that.

274
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:12,413
你要我嫁给你？
So you want me to marry you, then?

275
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,481
是有点突然，但可以的
Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

276
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,782
你这算是求婚？
Is that what you call a proposal?

277
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:19,480
我爱
I love you.

278
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:21,621
一直爱
Always have.

279
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,688
我想娶
I want to marry you.

280
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:38,737
这是答应了
Is that a yes?

281
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,598
对，答应了
- Aye, that's a yes.
- Yeah?

282
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,879
快点，他在等
We'd best hurry. He'll be waiting.

283
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:26,919
等等
Oh, wait.

284
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:28,045
要去那里？
Where are you going?

285
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:35,953
那是什么？
What's that?

286
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,189
等会便知道
You'll see.

287
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,177
神父
Father.

288
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:12,027
我会爱一生
I will love you my whole life.

289
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,365
除了不会再有别人
You and no other.

290
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:22,136
我对你一样
And I you.

291
00:37:22,944 --> 00:37:25,378
只有你不会再有别人…到永远
You and no other... for ever.

292
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,180
你们在上帝面前来求见证

293
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:56,179
何时能再见？今晚？
When will I see ye again? Tonight?

294
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:57,553
不行
I can't.

295
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:00,024
为什么？爹会起疑
Why not? My dad's growing suspicious.

296
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,958
跟这没关系
Would that have anything to do with...

297
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:04,292
何时？何时？
When?

298
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:06,156
何时呢？

299
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,658
什么时候？
When?

300
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:11,271
今晚
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

301
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:19,407
警觉点，士兵
Look lively, Sergeant.

302
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,691
带着什么？
What are you carrying, lassie?

303
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,928
看来很重，让我帮
That looks heavy. Can we help you?

304
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,591
我自己可以了
That's fine.

305
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:01,090
I'm not going to steal it...

306
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:43,463
使我想起自己女儿
You remind me of my daughter back home.

307
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:58,445
小女孩
Hello, lassie.

308
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,964
不！

309
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,430
安静点
Keep quiet, Smythe.

310
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:25,074
You bitch.

311
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:34,014
You bitch.

312
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:45,762
没事吧？
Are you all right?

313
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,969
没事吗？
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

314
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,505
能骑马吗？
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

315
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,816
回来，你这混蛋
Come back here, you bastard!

316
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:13,055
Ring the alarm. Help!

317
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:16,360
在海湾会面，快走
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

318
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:18,422
他们逃了
They're getting away.

319
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:03,435
All right, you bitch.

320
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:27,598
茉朗
Murron.

321
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,574
茉朗

322
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:47,413
你们都应知道
All of you know full well

323
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:50,255
我所承受的苦痛
the great pains I've always taken

324
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:55,687
我们法律绝不可太严苛
never to be too strict, too rigid,
with the application of our laws.

325
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:58,588
结论是…
And, as a consequence,

326
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:01,994
难道我们没办法和平共处
have we not learned to live together

327
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:05,094
而这种漫无法纪的日子…
in relative peace and harmony?

328
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:16,142
竟是你们回报我德政的方式
And this... day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency.

329
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,093
你们让我毫无选择
You leave me with little choice.

330
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:37,567
攻击国王的士兵
An assault on the King's soldiers

331
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:42,475
一如攻击国王本人
is the same as an assault
on the King himself.

332
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:00,015
现在
Now,

333
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:03,595
让这好战者来找我吧
let this scrapper come to me.

334
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,814
There.

335
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:28,251
班长
Corporal.

336
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:29,989
安排弓箭手
Some archers on the tower. Now!

337
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:41,869
你还好吗？
Hold still, Father.

338
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,041
You idiot, boy.

339
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:11,556
- Father, are you all right?
- Aye.

340
00:53:34,147 --> 00:53:39,141
华莱士之子
MacCaulich.

341
00:53:41,588 --> 00:53:43,215
华莱士之子

342
00:53:44,191 --> 00:54:00,631
华莱士之子
Wallace.

343
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:18,107
你还在等什么？
What are you waiting for, boy?

344
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,206
来，你做得到的
Here. You can do it.

345
00:56:21,314 --> 00:56:22,611
我来压住他
I'll hold him down.

346
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:26,842
你办的到
Here. You can do it.

347
00:56:26,953 --> 00:56:28,352
我压住他
I'll hold him down.

348
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:30,189
倒在伤口上
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

349
00:56:30,523 --> 00:56:33,890
我知道这是糟蹋，宽恕我吧
I know it seems like a waste
of good whisky. lndulge me.

350
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:40,097
你还好吧？
Hold him. Hold him. Hold him.

351
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:42,426
Now, let him go.

352
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:48,306
你还好吧？
All right?

353
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:50,905
会让你清醒到天明
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

354
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:53,469
有人来了
There's somebody coming.

355
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,411
警戒
Arm yourselves.

356
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,948
有人来了
There's somebody coming.

357
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:05,457
是麦奎格
MacGregors.

358
00:57:05,558 --> 00:57:06,820
是另一族的
From the next glen.

359
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:13,958
我们听到这里发生的事
We heard about what was happening.

360
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:18,393
我们不会让你们独享其乐
We don't want you amerdans thinking
you can have your fun without us.

361
00:57:18,505 --> 00:57:19,972
对

362
00:57:20,373 --> 00:57:22,102
回去
Go home.

363
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,040
很多人已牵涉在内
Some of us are in this.

364
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,477
我也没办法
I can't help that now.

365
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:29,878
但你们可以救自己
But you can help yourselves.

366
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:31,143
回家去
Go home.

367
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:32,650
我们早就没家了
We'll have no homes left

368
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:35,744
我们的家都给英格兰军烧毁
when the English garrison burns us out.

369
00:57:36,856 --> 00:57:38,551
他们会奋战的
- And they will.
- Aye.

370
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:43,320
Welcome.

371
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,421
哨兵回来了，大人
Patrol returning, my Lord.

372
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:44,153
有何状况？
So, what news?

373
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:59,170
我征调了一百名士兵到兰纳
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.

374
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,170
他们现在就会回来
They will be returning now.

375
00:59:01,274 --> 00:59:03,538
穿这样子吗？
Were they dressed like this?

376
00:59:04,611 --> 00:59:06,374
事实好像只有五十名
Actually, it was more like 50.

377
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:08,612
快动手
Make it quick.

378
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:13,249
记得我吗？
Do you remember me?

379
00:59:14,654 --> 00:59:16,986
我没伤害她，那是我的权利
I never did her any harm. It was my right.

380
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,216
你的权利？

381
00:59:18,324 --> 00:59:21,418
我来此是申讨我做丈夫的权利
I'm here to claim the right of a husband!

382
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:29,830
我是威廉华莱士
I'm William Wallace.

383
00:59:32,138 --> 00:59:34,197
我会饶了你们其余的人
And the rest of you will be spared.

384
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:38,406
回去告诉英格兰人
Go back to England. And tell them there

385
00:59:38,778 --> 00:59:42,214
苏格兰的儿女不再属于你们
that Scotland's daughters and
her sons are yours no more.

386
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:46,950
告诉他们苏格兰是自由的
Tell them Scotland is free.

387
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:53,783
烧了它！
Burn it.

388
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:32,963
苏格兰叛军击败我的驻军
The Scottish rebels have
routed one of my garrisons

389
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:35,227
谋杀了贵族地主
and murdered the noble Lord.

390
01:00:35,335 --> 01:00:36,563
我听说了
I heard.

391
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:39,636
华莱士只不过是个土匪
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

392
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:42,669
你要如何对付这个土匪？
And how would you deal with this... brigand?

393
01:00:42,775 --> 01:00:44,606
就像对付一般的盗贼
Like any common thief.

394
01:00:44,711 --> 01:00:47,202
让当地官员依罪判刑
Have the local magistrate
arrest and punish him.

395
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,347
退下吧
Leave us.

396
01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:08,596
华莱士已杀了当地官员
Wallace has already killed the magistrate
and taken control of the town.

397
01:01:08,801 --> 01:01:10,166
站起来
Stand up.

398
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,794
站起来
Stand up!

399
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:14,502
一到早上…
In the morning,

400
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:18,840
我会对法国施压确立我的权力
I depart for France to
press our rights there.

401
01:01:18,945 --> 01:01:21,846
我让你来镇压这叛军
And I leave you here to quell
this little rebellion.

402
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:23,279
明白吗？
Understood?

403
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:25,078
懂吗？
Is it?

404
01:01:28,054 --> 01:01:31,046
终有一日，你会成为国王
One day you will be a king.

405
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,721
至少表现得像个君王
At least try to act like one.

406
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:40,125
少烦我
Get away from me.

407
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,862
召唤我的军事大臣
Convene my military council.

408
01:01:53,613 --> 01:01:56,138
希望丈夫到苏格兰

409
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,377
迎战华莱士

410
01:02:00,186 --> 01:02:02,211
那便能成为寡妇

411
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:25,440
在那里
There.

412
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:29,339
去追他们
After them.

413
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:58,169
反抗是无用的
No point resisting.

414
01:02:58,277 --> 01:02:59,676
你们寡不敌众
You're outnumbered and trapped.

415
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:03,342
- 其他人呢？
- 华莱士呢？
- Where are the rest of you?
- Where's Wallace?

416
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:16,621
父亲
Father.

417
01:03:16,763 --> 01:03:18,424
进来，进来
Ah, come in. Come in.

418
01:03:19,532 --> 01:03:21,295
发生叛乱了
A rebellion has begun.

419
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:29,766
由谁领导的？
Under whom?

420
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,173
一个平民
A commoner...

421
01:03:31,344 --> 01:03:33,437
名叫威廉华莱士
named William Wallace.

422
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:46,656
你包抄叛军
You will embrace this rebellion.

423
01:03:46,759 --> 01:03:49,489
从北方进攻
Support it from our lands in the North.

424
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:54,266
我向英格兰军示好要他们
I will gain English favor by
condemning it and ordering it

425
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,268
自南方夹攻
opposed from our lands in the South.

426
01:03:59,038 --> 01:04:02,303
坐，留一会儿
Sit down. Stay awhile.

427
01:04:08,781 --> 01:04:13,650
这华莱士，他不是骑士
This Wallace... He doesn't
even have a knighthood.

428
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:16,381
但他凭热血战斗
But he fights with passion.

429
01:04:16,489 --> 01:04:18,457
他还激励了士气
And he inspires!

430
01:04:18,558 --> 01:04:21,755
你也希望能像他一样战斗
And you wish to charge
off and fight as he did?

431
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:24,590
我也想
So would I.

432
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,560
我想是时机了
Well, maybe it's time.

433
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,962
是时候去争取生存
It is time... to survive.

434
01:04:30,136 --> 01:04:32,934
你是布鲁士伯爵十七世
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

435
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,805
祖先将土地头衔传袭给你
The 16 before you passed you land and title

436
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:39,275
因为他们没有参与战事
because they didn't charge in.

437
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:42,103
召唤贵族开会
Call a meeting of the nobles.

438
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:43,546
他们只会纸上谈兵
They do nothing but talk.

439
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:45,810
对，就像我们一样
Rightly so. They're as rich

440
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:49,376
空拥有两国的头衔、土地
in English titles and lands as
they are in Scottish, as we are.

441
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:52,355
你崇拜这威廉华莱士
You admire this man... this William Wallace.

442
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:55,552
不妥协的人较易受人崇拜
Uncompromising men are easier to admire.

443
01:04:55,661 --> 01:04:57,788
他有胆，但狗也有胆
He has courage. So does a dog.

444
01:04:57,997 --> 01:05:03,367
要有妥协能力才使人尊贵
But it is exactly the ability to
compromise that makes a man noble.

445
01:05:03,703 --> 01:05:05,466
记住
And understand this:

446
01:05:05,571 --> 01:05:10,440
爱德华是英格兰历史的暴君
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless
king ever to sit on the throne of England.

447
01:05:10,877 --> 01:05:12,674
我们任何一人
And none of us

448
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:15,679
或苏格兰任何一物都不会留存
and nothing of Scotland will remain

449
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:18,249
除非我们也同样残暴
unless we are as ruthless.

450
01:05:18,985 --> 01:05:21,453
去听我们贵族说话
Give ear to our nobles.

451
01:05:22,021 --> 01:05:24,319
了解他们的心态
Knowing their minds

452
01:05:24,524 --> 01:05:26,924
就是稳坐王位之钥
is the key to the throne.

453
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:44,870
等等
Wait. Look.

454
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:48,503
不是这样，这是左边
This is out and this is left.

455
01:05:48,981 --> 01:05:51,643
继续走啊，走吧
Carry on.

456
01:05:56,522 --> 01:06:00,014
国王会让他们穿这新衣下葬

457
01:06:00,459 --> 01:06:02,290
苏格兰正一片混乱

458
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:06,160
的丈夫秘密派遣军队到北方

459
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:07,562
怎么知道？

460
01:06:08,534 --> 01:06:12,129
昨晚我和一军事大臣共眠

461
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:14,706
他不该在床上泄露军机

462
01:06:14,941 --> 01:06:16,101
对唷

463
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:18,575
但英格兰人不会用舌头

464
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:25,608
这苏格兰叛军…华莱士

465
01:06:25,918 --> 01:06:27,408
他是为一个女人报仇而战？

466
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,851
我差不多忘了

467
01:06:29,388 --> 01:06:32,289
一个军官想捉他

468
01:06:32,391 --> 01:06:34,154
知道他有个秘密爱人

469
01:06:38,364 --> 01:06:39,661
他就割了那女孩的喉咙

470
01:06:40,299 --> 01:06:41,766
想引他出战

471
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:43,600
他是出战了

472
01:06:45,004 --> 01:06:47,438
知晓他失去爱人的伤痛

473
01:06:47,974 --> 01:06:50,807
他们设计拿他

474
01:06:51,143 --> 01:06:54,943
他们亵渎他父兄的坟墓

475
01:06:55,715 --> 01:06:58,548
并在他爱人坟旁安排陷阱

476
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,353
他一路勇战，突破陷阱

477
01:07:05,825 --> 01:07:09,226
将她的尸首带到一个秘密地方

478
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,334
好浪漫吧？

479
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:18,764
浪漫？

480
01:07:21,374 --> 01:07:22,671
我不知道

481
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,512
知道吗？
You know,

482
01:07:35,688 --> 01:07:39,021
长脚会派他北方大军出征
Eventually, Longshanks will
send in his northern army.

483
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:40,489
重装骑兵
Heavy cavalry.

484
01:07:40,626 --> 01:07:41,957
铠甲战马
Armored horse.

485
01:07:42,061 --> 01:07:43,460
气势迫人
Shake the very ground.

486
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:46,424
他们大兵压境
He'll ride right over us.

487
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:48,600
亚盖叔叔曾说过
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it.

488
01:07:49,268 --> 01:07:52,362
没有军队能敌得过重骑兵
How no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

489
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:53,503
我们该怎么办？
So what do we do?

490
01:07:53,606 --> 01:07:56,598
打、跑、躲，高原人的战术
Hit. Run. Hide. The Highland way.

491
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:06,510
我们要造矛
Or make spears.

492
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:08,846
数以百计的矛
Hundreds of 'em.

493
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:11,047
长矛，要比人长一倍
Long spears. Twice as long as a man.

494
01:08:11,657 --> 01:08:12,487
那么长？
That long?

495
01:08:12,591 --> 01:08:13,956
对
Aye.

496
01:08:15,294 --> 01:08:17,091
有的人是比较长
Some men are longer than others.

497
01:08:17,263 --> 01:08:19,458
你妈又跟我讲故事了
Your mother been telling
you stories about me again?

498
01:08:22,034 --> 01:08:23,831
志愿军到了
Volunteers coming in.

499
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,399
威廉华莱士
William Wallace.

500
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:30,609
我们来此为你作战
We've come to fight and to die for you.

501
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:32,939
站起来，我不是教宗
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

502
01:08:34,113 --> 01:08:36,707
我叫费庄，我的剑听你差遣
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

503
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:38,209
我带给你这个
I brought you this...

504
01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:39,841
我们已搜过身
We checked them for arms.

505
01:08:41,187 --> 01:08:42,654
我带给你这个
I brought you this.

506
01:08:43,356 --> 01:08:45,187
我太太做的
My wife made it for you.

507
01:08:45,524 --> 01:08:46,718
谢谢
Thank you.

508
01:08:51,063 --> 01:08:53,930
他？他不可能是威廉华莱士
Him! That can't be William Wallace.

509
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:56,092
我比他好看多了
I'm prettier than this man.

510
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:01,606
好吧，天父，我来问他
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

511
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,470
若我为你卖命
If I risk my neck for you,

512
01:09:07,713 --> 01:09:09,704
我有机会杀英格兰人吗？
will I get to kill Englishmen?

513
01:09:09,815 --> 01:09:11,510
你的父亲是鬼吗？
Is your father a ghost

514
01:09:11,617 --> 01:09:13,414
还是你能与万能天父交谈
or do you converse with the Almighty?

515
01:09:13,519 --> 01:09:16,613
爱尔兰人可与天父交谈
To find his equal, an Irishman
is forced to talk to God.

516
01:09:16,722 --> 01:09:17,689
是的，天父
Yes, Father.

517
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:18,848
万能的天父回答说：
The Almighty says,

518
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,620
别换话题，快回答他妈的问题
"Just answer the fucking question!"

519
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:22,751
注意你的嘴巴
Mind your tongue.

520
01:09:22,862 --> 01:09:24,056
狂傲的爱尔兰人
lnsane Irish!

521
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,669
能聪明的带匕首避过守卫
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

522
01:09:32,772 --> 01:09:34,967
他是我朋友，爱尔兰人
That's my friend, Irishman.

523
01:09:35,074 --> 01:09:37,235
你问题的答案是“可以”
And the answer to your question is yes.

524
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:39,573
为我作战，可以杀英格兰人
Fight for me, you get to kill the English.

525
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:41,511
太好了
Excellent.

526
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:43,344
我叫史提芬
Stephen is my name.

527
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,574
是我岛上的头号通缉犯
I'm the most wanted man on my island.

528
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:49,119
除了，我不在岛上
Except I'm not on my island, of course.

529
01:09:49,355 --> 01:09:50,720
太可惜了
More's the pity.

530
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,051
你的岛？你是指爱尔兰？
Your island? You mean Ireland?

531
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:55,059
对，是我的
Yeah. It's mine.

532
01:09:59,298 --> 01:10:00,731
你疯了
You're a madman.

533
01:10:08,307 --> 01:10:10,605
我真来对了地方
I've come to the right place, then.

534
01:11:30,956 --> 01:11:34,016
万能天主派我来保护你
Sure, didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

535
01:11:35,861 --> 01:11:37,726
我反正也不喜欢他
I didn't like him anyway.

536
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,861
他的头脑有问题
He wasn't right in the head.

537
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:57,073
威廉
William.

538
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:58,547
有两个人
It's our runners.

539
01:12:09,828 --> 01:12:11,090
英格兰人
The English...

540
01:12:11,196 --> 01:12:13,664
派军朝向史特兰
are advancing an army towards Stirling.

541
01:12:13,766 --> 01:12:14,790
贵族们有集合吗？
Do the nobles rally?

542
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:18,563
布鲁士及大多数人都不会参与
Robert the Bruce and others will not fight.

543
01:12:18,671 --> 01:12:19,831
但话已传开
But word has spread.

544
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:22,499
高原武士也加入战局
- The Highlanders are coming down on their own.
- Aye...

545
01:12:22,741 --> 01:12:25,505
有上千名战士
In droves of hundreds... and thousands!

546
01:12:25,678 --> 01:12:27,270
准备好作战吗？
Are you ready for a war?

547
01:12:27,379 --> 01:12:29,244
是

548
01:12:30,249 --> 01:12:32,513
史特兰

549
01:12:43,228 --> 01:12:44,252
那边有何消息？
What news?

550
01:12:44,363 --> 01:12:46,126
我们以寡击众，3比1
We're outnumbered, at least three to one.

551
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:47,061
有多少战马？
How many horse, then?

552
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,724
三百匹重装战马，也许更多
300, maybe more.

553
01:12:48,834 --> 01:12:50,301
三百匹重装战马
300 heavy horse!

554
01:12:50,402 --> 01:12:51,960
我们要与他们谈判
We must try to negotiate.

555
01:12:52,071 --> 01:12:53,504
谁坐镇指挥？
Who was in command?

556
01:12:53,606 --> 01:12:55,801
他有红色臂章吗？
Did he have a scarlet chevron?

557
01:12:55,908 --> 01:12:57,507
- 有的
- 那是凯森
- Aye, he did.
- That'll be Cheltham.

558
01:12:57,943 --> 01:13:00,104
我们仍可谈判
We could still negotiate...

559
01:13:04,216 --> 01:13:05,444
他们在说什么？
What are they talking about?

560
01:13:06,552 --> 01:13:08,349
我听不到，但似乎不妙
I cannae hear, but it doesnae look good.

561
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:10,744
贵族要谈判
The nobles will negotiate.

562
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:12,483
若谈判…
They do a deal...

563
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:14,355
我们就要回去
and we go home.

564
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:16,319
若不妥协
If not...

565
01:13:16,428 --> 01:13:17,258
我们就进攻
we charge.

566
01:13:17,529 --> 01:13:19,690
我们别无选择
300 heavy horse. We've no chance.

567
01:14:19,258 --> 01:14:20,350
这么多
So many.

568
01:14:25,664 --> 01:14:28,531
我来作战并非帮他们争权夺地
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

569
01:14:28,701 --> 01:14:29,963
还要为他们卖命
Then I'd have to work for them.

570
01:14:31,036 --> 01:14:32,162
我也不是
Nor me.

571
01:14:33,706 --> 01:14:35,264
好了，孩子们
All right, lads.

572
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:37,701
我不要为这混蛋送命
I'm not dying for these bastards.

573
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:39,741
我们回家去
Let's go home.

574
01:14:57,129 --> 01:14:59,120
站住
Stop, men!

575
01:14:59,231 --> 01:15:00,698
不要走
Do not flee.

576
01:15:00,799 --> 01:15:03,393
等候谈判
Wait until we've negotiated.

577
01:15:56,655 --> 01:15:57,883
威廉华莱士
William Wallace!

578
01:15:57,990 --> 01:16:00,185
不可能，不够高
Can't be. Not tall enough.

579
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:24,308
上天说这是场很好的战争
The Almighty says this
is a fashionable fight.

580
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:25,576
吸引了最好的人
It's drawn the finest people.

581
01:16:25,684 --> 01:16:27,015
你的礼仪呢？
Where is thy salute?

582
01:16:27,252 --> 01:16:29,880
对你亲自现身此战场
For coming to this battlefield,

583
01:16:30,122 --> 01:16:31,214
我向你致谢
I thank you.

584
01:16:31,323 --> 01:16:34,224
这是我们的军队，要便来加入效力
This is our army. To join
it, you give homage.

585
01:16:34,326 --> 01:16:36,021
我向苏格兰效忠
I give homage to Scotland.

586
01:16:37,396 --> 01:16:39,387
这若是你的军队
And if this is your army,

587
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:42,258
他们为何离开？
why does it go?

588
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,835
我们不是来此为他们作战
We didn't come here to fight for them.

589
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,666
回家吧
Home.

590
01:16:49,775 --> 01:16:51,174
太多英格兰军了
The English are too many.

591
01:17:00,152 --> 01:17:02,211
苏格兰之子
Sons of Scotland!

592
01:17:02,855 --> 01:17:04,618
我是威廉华莱士
I am William Wallace!

593
01:17:04,823 --> 01:17:06,757
华莱士有七英尺高
William Wallace is seven feet tall.

594
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:08,449
我听说了
Yes, I've heard.

595
01:17:09,294 --> 01:17:11,159
他杀人数以百计
He kills men by the hundred.

596
01:17:11,496 --> 01:17:13,123
他若在此
And if he were here,

597
01:17:13,232 --> 01:17:16,201
他会眼射火球烧死英格兰军
he'd consume the English
with fireballs from his eyes

598
01:17:16,301 --> 01:17:18,132
还从他屁股放雷电
and lightning from his arse.

599
01:17:21,807 --> 01:17:23,365
我就是威廉华莱士
I am William Wallace!

600
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:27,039
我看到…
And I see

601
01:17:27,145 --> 01:17:30,012
我民族组成的军队
a whole army of my countrymen

602
01:17:30,115 --> 01:17:32,345
向暴政宣战
here in defiance of tyranny.

603
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:38,249
你们作战是为解放人民
You've come to fight as free men

604
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:42,122
你们也将自由
and free men you are!

605
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,721
若没有自由能怎么办？
What will you do without freedom?

606
01:17:49,902 --> 01:17:51,802
你们愿意作战吗？
Will you fight?

607
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:56,271
对抗那？
Against that?

608
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,104
不，我们会逃走
No. We will run,

609
01:17:58,944 --> 01:18:00,104
我们可以活着
and we will live.

610
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:01,871
对
Aye.

611
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,572
作战，可能会战死
Fight and you may die.

612
01:18:04,049 --> 01:18:06,017
逃开，能活着
Run, and you'll live.

613
01:18:06,985 --> 01:18:08,543
至少一阵子
At least a while.

614
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:16,117
很多年后…在床上老死
And dying in your beds, many years from now,

615
01:18:16,595 --> 01:18:18,119
你们是否愿意…
would you be willing

616
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:21,927
用这一切来换今天
to trade all the days from this day to that

617
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:23,331
为一个机会
for one chance,

618
01:18:23,435 --> 01:18:24,993
就这么一个机会
just one chance,

619
01:18:25,103 --> 01:18:26,536
回到这里
to come back here

620
01:18:26,638 --> 01:18:28,902
将我们的敌人杀死
and tell our enemies

621
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:31,100
他们或许会杀死我们
that they may take our lives

622
01:18:31,276 --> 01:18:32,937
但他们不能夺去
but they'll never take

623
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:34,945
我们的自由
our freedom!

624
01:19:01,707 --> 01:19:03,698
他们看来很乐观
They seem quite optimistic.

625
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:05,001
也许他们真愿意出战
Maybe they do want to fight.

626
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:08,170
对峙也许是预料中的结果
Confrontation might be a foregone conclusion.

627
01:19:08,847 --> 01:19:10,439
但虽然如此…
Nonetheless,

628
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:11,914
我们该传达国王的条件
we should deliver the King's terms.

629
01:19:12,017 --> 01:19:13,075
国王的条件？
The King's terms?

630
01:19:13,185 --> 01:19:14,618
他们绝不同意的
They'll never live up to them.

631
01:19:15,287 --> 01:19:16,845
大王，我想…
My Lord, I think...

632
01:19:16,955 --> 01:19:19,719
好吧，给他们条件吧
All right. Offer them the terms.

633
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:24,756
他们出来了
They're coming out. Should we go to them?

634
01:19:24,863 --> 01:19:27,457
- 我来跟他们谈
- 好！
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?
- Aye.

635
01:19:33,505 --> 01:19:35,063
讲得好
Fine speech.

636
01:19:35,874 --> 01:19:37,466
现在怎么做？
Now what do we do?

637
01:19:39,044 --> 01:19:41,035
就如我们所计划的
Just be yourselves.

638
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,011
你去哪？
Where are you going?

639
01:19:43,248 --> 01:19:44,875
去找麻烦
I'm going to pick a fight.

640
01:19:53,525 --> 01:19:55,516
我们不是没理由全副武装的
We didn't get dressed up for nothing.

641
01:19:57,829 --> 01:19:59,820
莫瑞，卢克兰，克格…
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

642
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,801
这是国王的条件
Here are the King's terms.

643
01:20:07,205 --> 01:20:10,663
将军队带离战场
Lead this army off the field

644
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:18,677
他会把约克郡的土地赐给你们
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire

645
01:20:18,784 --> 01:20:20,911
还包括世袭头衔
including hereditary title,

646
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:23,380
而你们所要付出的
from which you will pay...

647
01:20:23,688 --> 01:20:25,656
只是给他年税…！
From which you will pay...

648
01:20:25,757 --> 01:20:28,555
我有个提议
- I have an offer for ye.
- Cheltham,

649
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,389
别理他，他是威廉华莱士
this is William Wallace.

650
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,625
你们要付给他年税…
From which you will pay the King...

651
01:20:33,732 --> 01:20:35,461
我说我有个提议给你
I said I have an offer.

652
01:20:35,567 --> 01:20:37,034
你态度不恭敬
You disrespect a banner of truce.

653
01:20:37,135 --> 01:20:39,433
对他的国王？你说得对
From his King? Absolutely.

654
01:20:40,205 --> 01:20:42,264
这是苏格兰开的条件：
Here are Scotland's terms.

655
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:44,536
降下你们的旗子
Lower your flags

656
01:20:44,643 --> 01:20:46,508
回去英格兰
and march straight back to England.

657
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:49,239
每遇民舍就停下来…
At every home you pass, beg forgiveness

658
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:52,373
为百年来的杀人掳掠求恕
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

659
01:20:52,684 --> 01:20:55,050
这样做，你们就能活着
Do that, and your men shall live.

660
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,010
不做…
Do it not

661
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:59,316
你们今天全会死
and every one of you will die today.

662
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:07,629
你太嚣张
You are outmatched.

663
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:09,992
你并没有重装骑兵
You have no heavy cavalry.

664
01:21:10,102 --> 01:21:12,127
两世纪来，没有军队能打赢
In two centuries, no army has won without....

665
01:21:12,237 --> 01:21:14,330
我还没说完
I'm not finished!

666
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:18,509
在让你们离开前
Before we let you leave

667
01:21:18,677 --> 01:21:21,305
你们统领必须穿过战场
your commander must cross that field,

668
01:21:21,413 --> 01:21:23,574
站在这军队前
present himself before this army,

669
01:21:23,682 --> 01:21:27,812
将他的头夹在大腿里亲屁股
put his head between his
legs and kiss his own arse.

670
01:21:38,163 --> 01:21:40,757
他平时的态度比较好
That was less cordial than he was used to.

671
01:21:40,866 --> 01:21:43,027
准备听我指挥
You be ready and do exactly as I say.

672
01:21:43,135 --> 01:21:44,227
当听到我信号…
On my signal

673
01:21:44,336 --> 01:21:45,769
你骑到后面去攻击他们
ride round behind our position,

674
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:47,429
夹杀他们！
and flank them.

675
01:21:47,572 --> 01:21:48,834
我们必须通知先锋部队
We must not divide our forces.

676
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,464
快去！
Do it...

677
01:21:50,675 --> 01:21:52,700
让英格兰军看到你的动作
and let the English see you do it.

678
01:21:53,044 --> 01:21:54,602
他们会认为我们要逃跑了
They'll think we run away?

679
01:21:55,413 --> 01:21:56,971
杀了他们的弓箭手
Take out their archers

680
01:21:57,082 --> 01:21:58,276
我来战场上会你
and meet in the middle.

681
01:21:58,383 --> 01:21:59,680
是，出发
Right. Come on.

682
01:22:24,242 --> 01:22:26,039
无礼的混帐
lnsolent bastard.

683
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:28,475
我要将他的心放这盘上
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate!

684
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,411
弓箭手
Archers.

685
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:42,187
Archers forward.

686
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,147
You bastards.

687
01:24:15,253 --> 01:24:16,481
放箭
Loose.

688
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:39,169
上天说k会让我在战役中生还
The Lord tells me He can
get me out of this mess

689
01:24:39,277 --> 01:24:41,245
k认为你完了
but He's pretty sure you're fucked.

690
01:25:02,233 --> 01:25:03,530
预备！
Ready...

691
01:25:03,635 --> 01:25:05,034
放箭！
- Loose.
- Ride.

692
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,386
看，苏格兰的骑兵都在逃跑
See? Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

693
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:33,794
我们的骑兵会将他们如草般辗过
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.

694
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:35,593
派出骑兵队
Send the horse.

695
01:25:35,934 --> 01:25:37,026
全面进攻
Full attack.

696
01:26:52,076 --> 01:26:53,065
稳住
Steady...

697
01:26:55,113 --> 01:26:56,375
稳住！
Hold.

698
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:59,915
稳住！
Hold.

699
01:27:04,656 --> 01:27:05,884
稳住！
Hold.

700
01:27:10,628 --> 01:27:11,788
稳住！！！
Hold.

701
01:27:23,808 --> 01:27:26,675
攻！
Now!

702
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:13,252
派步兵队
Send the infantry.

703
01:28:13,358 --> 01:28:14,382
大人
My Lord...

704
01:28:14,492 --> 01:28:15,789
你来带领
You lead them.

705
01:28:29,107 --> 01:28:32,008
Charge.

706
01:30:35,233 --> 01:30:36,359
Retreat.

707
01:31:11,235 --> 01:31:13,569
Bastard.

708
01:31:14,138 --> 01:31:16,333
Come on.

709
01:31:56,747 --> 01:31:58,374
All right.

710
01:32:28,045 --> 01:32:34,814
“华莱士”！！！
Wallace.

711
01:32:35,486 --> 01:32:37,818
Wallace.

712
01:33:10,788 --> 01:33:14,815
我授封你为威廉华莱士爵士
I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

713
01:33:18,396 --> 01:33:19,727
威廉爵士
Sir William,

714
01:33:20,031 --> 01:33:21,089
依天主之名
in the name of God

715
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:24,498
指派你为苏格兰保护者
we appoint thee guardian and
high protector of Scotland

716
01:33:24,602 --> 01:33:26,934
为侍从武官统率
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

717
01:33:27,705 --> 01:33:29,798
起身，让众人褒扬
Stand and be recognized.

718
01:33:41,919 --> 01:33:43,682
他明白自己的立场吗？
Does anyone know his politics?

719
01:33:43,821 --> 01:33:45,311
不知道，但他在平民的影响力
No, but his weight with

720
01:33:45,423 --> 01:33:47,152
会将所有事搞乱
the commoners could upset everything.

721
01:33:47,525 --> 01:33:49,493
贝立欧派会尽力巴结
The Balliols will kiss his arse,

722
01:33:49,594 --> 01:33:50,686
所以我们也得照做
and so we must.

723
01:33:58,803 --> 01:33:59,861
威廉爵士
Sir William.

724
01:34:04,508 --> 01:34:06,032
威廉爵士

725
01:34:06,444 --> 01:34:13,441
你和各统领来此支援贝立欧派
lnasmuch as you and your captains hail from a
region long known to support the Balliol clan,

726
01:34:13,551 --> 01:34:17,351
我们请您继续支援
may we invite you to continue your support

727
01:34:17,455 --> 01:34:19,355
并大力支持我们的王法
and uphold our rightful claim?

728
01:34:19,457 --> 01:34:21,550
去他的贝立欧派！
Damn the Balliol clan.

729
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:23,820
他们都是长脚的爪牙
They're all Longshanks's men.

730
01:34:24,128 --> 01:34:25,618
各位
Gentlemen.

731
01:34:27,465 --> 01:34:29,865
- 各位！
- 让我们来向国王宣誓
- Gentlemen.
- It's time to declare a king.

732
01:34:30,001 --> 01:34:31,127
等等
Halt. Wait.

733
01:34:31,235 --> 01:34:34,204
你得承认我们合法的继承权
Are you prepared to recognize
our legitimate succession?

734
01:34:34,305 --> 01:34:36,068
你才不会支持…
You won't support the claim.

735
01:34:36,173 --> 01:34:38,038
从一开始就是谎言
Those were lies, written by you.

736
01:34:38,142 --> 01:34:39,575
不
Oh, no.

737
01:34:40,311 --> 01:34:41,903
看这文件
I demand recognition of these documents.

738
01:34:42,013 --> 01:34:44,914
在签写这些文件时就已是谎言
These were lies when you wrote them.

739
01:34:47,518 --> 01:34:50,487
各位，安静
Please, gentlemen.

740
01:34:50,955 --> 01:34:53,446
等等，威廉爵士，你要去哪？
Quiet. Sir William. Where are you going?

741
01:34:55,927 --> 01:34:57,690
我们已打败英格兰军
We have beaten the English.

742
01:34:58,162 --> 01:34:59,789
但他们仍会回来
But they'll come back

743
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:02,499
因为你们不肯团结
because you won't stand together.

744
01:35:03,334 --> 01:35:04,460
你要怎么做？
What will you do?

745
01:35:04,568 --> 01:35:06,433
侵略英格兰
I will invade England

746
01:35:06,604 --> 01:35:08,697
在他们土地上击败他们
and defeat the English on their own ground.

747
01:35:11,642 --> 01:35:13,803
侵略？不可能！
lnvade? That's impossible.

748
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:15,105
为什么？
Why?

749
01:35:15,346 --> 01:35:16,836
为什么不可能？
Why is that impossible?

750
01:35:17,515 --> 01:35:22,350
你们如此费心为长脚利益争执
You're so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from Longshanks's table

751
01:35:22,553 --> 01:35:25,920
欲忽略上天所赋予的更好权益
that you've missed your God-given
right to something better.

752
01:35:26,691 --> 01:35:28,818
我们的观点有差异
There's a difference between us.

753
01:35:29,126 --> 01:35:31,151
你们认为苏格兰人存在价值…
You think the people of Scotland exist

754
01:35:31,262 --> 01:35:33,196
是提供你地位
to provide you with position.

755
01:35:33,631 --> 01:35:35,462
我认为你地位的存在…
I think your position exists

756
01:35:35,566 --> 01:35:37,591
是为了给他们自由
to provide those people with freedom.

757
01:35:38,936 --> 01:35:41,666
我要确定他们获得自由
And I go to make sure that they have it.

758
01:35:54,785 --> 01:35:56,514
等一下
Wait.

759
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:01,282
我敬佩你刚才所说的
I respect what you said.

760
01:36:01,392 --> 01:36:04,589
但记着这些人有土地城堡
But remember that these
men have lands and castles.

761
01:36:05,296 --> 01:36:06,593
这样做太冒险
It's much to risk.

762
01:36:06,697 --> 01:36:08,790
平民在战役中流血丧命…
And the common man that bleeds in battle,

763
01:36:08,899 --> 01:36:10,366
他们冒的风险小吗？
does he risk less?

764
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:16,739
不
No.

765
01:36:16,907 --> 01:36:20,434
但从上至下，这国家已无界定
But from top to bottom, this
country has got no sense of itself.

766
01:36:20,544 --> 01:36:23,707
贵族在为英格兰效忠
lts nobles share allegiance with England.

767
01:36:23,814 --> 01:36:25,179
是他们派系之战争
lts clans war with each other.

768
01:36:25,282 --> 01:36:26,476
对
Aye.

769
01:36:28,152 --> 01:36:32,179
若你两边树敌，结果只有死路
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border, you'll end up dead.

770
01:36:32,289 --> 01:36:34,814
人都会死，只是原因不同
We all will. It's a question of how and why.

771
01:36:34,925 --> 01:36:37,257
我不是懦夫，我要你所要的
I'm not a coward. I want what you want.

772
01:36:37,361 --> 01:36:39,056
但我们需要贵族
But we need the nobles.

773
01:36:39,163 --> 01:36:40,790
- 我们需要他们
- 是啊！
- We need 'em?
- Aye.

774
01:36:40,898 --> 01:36:42,058
贵族

775
01:36:43,334 --> 01:36:45,825
做为一个贵族，有何意义？
What does that mean, to be noble?

776
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:48,868
衔头让你有坐上王位的资格
Your title gives you claim
to Scotland's throne,

777
01:36:49,073 --> 01:36:50,665
人是不会追随衔头的
but men don't follow titles.

778
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:53,070
人追随的是勇气
They follow courage.

779
01:36:53,244 --> 01:36:55,144
人们清楚你的所为
Our people know you.

780
01:36:55,246 --> 01:36:56,907
贵族、平民都敬重你
Noble and common, they respect you.

781
01:36:57,014 --> 01:37:01,041
若你带领他们朝向自由
And if you would just lead them to freedom...

782
01:37:02,987 --> 01:37:05,012
他们便会跟随你
they'd follow you.

783
01:37:06,724 --> 01:37:08,385
我也会
And so would I.

784
01:37:30,214 --> 01:37:31,272
混蛋
Damn it.

785
01:37:31,715 --> 01:37:35,173
那无能王子表哥说没军队借我
My sodomite cousin the Prince tells
me he has no troops to lend.

786
01:37:35,286 --> 01:37:37,277
英格兰北部的城全在求救
Every town in northern
England is begging for help.

787
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:40,788
他进军了
He advances.

788
01:37:40,891 --> 01:37:42,688
- 到哪个城？
- 这里，大人
- To which town?
- To here, my Lord.

789
01:37:43,894 --> 01:37:45,623
将食物收入城内
Bring the provisions inside,

790
01:37:45,729 --> 01:37:47,856
加强城墙守卫，快！
double the guards, seal the gate. Now.

791
01:37:49,233 --> 01:37:50,894
快去！
Quickly. Bring in the provisions.

792
01:38:21,465 --> 01:38:23,899
若你现在离开，还能有救
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

793
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:25,662
我不要禀告国王
I will not tell my uncle

794
01:38:25,769 --> 01:38:27,669
我失去英格兰北部最好的城堡
I've lost him the greatest city in the North.

795
01:39:08,979 --> 01:39:10,446
Come on.

796
01:39:45,115 --> 01:39:47,208
Make way for the King.

797
01:39:56,493 --> 01:39:57,858
这不是你的错
It's not your fault.

798
01:39:59,296 --> 01:40:00,285
去抵御他
Stand up to him.

799
01:40:00,397 --> 01:40:02,592
我会继续抗战的
I will stand up to him and more.

800
01:40:41,038 --> 01:40:42,437
北方有何新消息？
What news of the North?

801
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:48,471
没什么，已派了骑士加速传讯
Nothing new, Your Majesty. We've
sent riders to speed any word.

802
01:40:48,579 --> 01:40:54,074
在法国为未来王朝打拼时听说
I heard the word in France where I was
fighting to expand your future kingdom.

803
01:40:54,418 --> 01:41:00,379
我们北方军队全军覆没
The word, my son, is that our entire
northern army is annihilated.

804
01:41:01,225 --> 01:41:03,420
而你却束手无策
And you have done nothing.

805
01:41:04,662 --> 01:41:08,428
我已下令召募民兵，准备撤退
I... have ordered conscription,
sir, assembled and ready to depart.

806
01:41:10,734 --> 01:41:13,703
对不起，大人，约克传来急报
Excuse me, sire, but there's a
very urgent message from York.

807
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:15,195
拿来
Come.

808
01:41:23,814 --> 01:41:24,473
离开吧
Leave us.

809
01:41:24,581 --> 01:41:25,639
谢谢大人
Thank you, sire.

810
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:31,813
华莱士已攻下约克
Wallace has sacked York.

811
01:41:31,922 --> 01:41:33,753
- 什么？
- 华莱士已攻下约克
- What?
- Wallace has sacked York.

812
01:41:50,307 --> 01:41:52,172
大人…
Sire...

813
01:41:52,276 --> 01:41:53,800
您的外甥
thy own nephew.

814
01:41:54,345 --> 01:41:56,540
谁会这么残忍下手！
What beast could do such a thing.

815
01:41:58,248 --> 01:42:00,478
他若能攻下约克…
If he can sack York

816
01:42:02,886 --> 01:42:04,911
他就能席卷整个英格兰
he can invade Lower England.

817
01:42:05,022 --> 01:42:06,489
我们会制止他
We will stop him.

818
01:42:09,259 --> 01:42:11,056
此人是谁？
Who is this person

819
01:42:11,161 --> 01:42:14,187
自以为我需要他的意见
who speaks to me as though
I needed his advice?

820
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:18,267
我已指派菲利为首席顾问
I have declared Phillip my High Counsellor.

821
01:42:18,369 --> 01:42:19,961
他够资格吗？
Is he qualified?

822
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:25,007
我擅长分析战事与军事策略
I am skilled in the arts of
war and military tactics, sire.

823
01:42:25,175 --> 01:42:26,938
是吗？
Are you?

824
01:42:27,711 --> 01:42:28,871
告诉我
Tell me...

825
01:42:29,079 --> 01:42:33,482
你会提出何种建议…
What advice would you offer on the present...

826
01:42:33,584 --> 01:42:35,484
在这突发状况？
situation?

827
01:43:05,783 --> 01:43:08,251
我将提出休战
I shall offer a truce

828
01:43:09,186 --> 01:43:11,017
收买他
and buy him off.

829
01:43:13,023 --> 01:43:14,581
谁去见他？
But who will go to him?

830
01:43:15,058 --> 01:43:16,616
不是我
Not I.

831
01:43:17,094 --> 01:43:19,858
若我落在这凶手的剑下
If I fell under the sword of that murderer

832
01:43:19,963 --> 01:43:24,127
那将是我的头在这篮内
it might be my head in a basket.

833
01:43:24,301 --> 01:43:28,169
也不能是我的好儿子
And not... my gentle son.

834
01:43:28,272 --> 01:43:33,073
见到他的面，会激励敌人夺国
The mere sight of him would only encourage
an enemy to take over the whole country.

835
01:43:35,979 --> 01:43:38,413
我该派谁呢？
So whom do I send?

836
01:43:39,917 --> 01:43:44,183
该派谁呢？
Whom do I send?

837
01:45:07,537 --> 01:45:09,471
我在做梦
I'm dreaming.

838
01:45:09,572 --> 01:45:11,301
对，你在做梦
Yes, you are.

839
01:45:12,842 --> 01:45:14,434
你一定要醒来
And you must wake.

840
01:45:23,486 --> 01:45:25,317
我不想醒来
I don't want to wake.

841
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:29,254
我想陪着
I want to stay here with you.

842
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,191
我会陪着你
And I with you.

843
01:45:33,229 --> 01:45:34,856
但你现在一定要清醒
But you must wake now.

844
01:45:38,268 --> 01:45:39,997
醒来吧，威廉
Wake up, William.

845
01:45:40,737 --> 01:45:42,102
醒来
Wake up.

846
01:45:44,173 --> 01:45:46,334
威廉…醒来
William, wake up...

847
01:45:46,809 --> 01:45:50,245
威廉，有皇室的使者来到
William. A royal entourage comes

848
01:45:50,346 --> 01:45:52,143
举着白旗
flying banners of truce

849
01:45:52,248 --> 01:45:54,478
代表长脚本人
and the standards of Longshanks himself.

850
01:46:38,695 --> 01:46:40,526
我是威尔斯王妃
I am the Princess of Wales.

851
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:43,861
我是代表国王的钦差大臣
I come as the King's servant
and with his authority.

852
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:46,259
做什么呢？
To do what?

853
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:49,263
讨论他的提议
To discuss the King's proposals.

854
01:46:51,441 --> 01:46:53,568
你愿意与妇人交谈吗？
Will you speak with a woman?

855
01:47:14,197 --> 01:47:17,166
我知道您最近受封爵位
I hear you have been
given the rank of knight.

856
01:47:17,266 --> 01:47:19,063
我什么都没得到
I have been given nothing.

857
01:47:19,602 --> 01:47:21,593
天生我才必有用
God makes men what they are.

858
01:47:22,472 --> 01:47:25,407
上天让你的才能去掠夺城市？
God made you the sacker of peaceful cities?

859
01:47:25,575 --> 01:47:28,976
处决国王外甥，我夫君的表弟
The executioner of the King's
nephew, my husband's own cousin?

860
01:47:30,113 --> 01:47:34,106
约克是攻掠我国时的踏板
York was the staging point for
every invasion of my country.

861
01:47:35,084 --> 01:47:37,678
那位王室表弟吊死了无辜百姓
That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even women

862
01:47:37,787 --> 01:47:39,687
连妇孺也不放过
and children, from the city walls.

863
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:46,590
长脚上次攻占城市时更狠
Longshanks did far worse the last
time he took a Scottish city.

864
01:47:48,498 --> 01:47:51,228
他是个血腥的野蛮杀手

865
01:47:51,334 --> 01:47:53,268
他还会说谎

866
01:47:53,369 --> 01:47:55,735
我从不说谎

867
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,770
但我是个野蛮人

868
01:48:03,045 --> 01:48:05,673
不想的话可用法语交谈

869
01:48:07,216 --> 01:48:11,550
当面去问的国王，去问他
You ask your King... to his face. Ask him.

870
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:16,556
看他的眼神能否用真相说服
See if his eyes can
convince you of the truth.

871
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,198
汉默顿，退下
Hamilton... Leave us.

872
01:48:28,638 --> 01:48:29,400
王妃？
My Lady?

873
01:48:29,505 --> 01:48:31,666
退下…走
Leave us. Now.

874
01:48:42,985 --> 01:48:44,885
我们坦白的说
Let us talk plainly.

875
01:48:45,121 --> 01:48:47,055
你进军英格兰
You invade England.

876
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:51,793
但你因缺粮补给无法完成远征
But you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

877
01:48:53,095 --> 01:48:55,029
国王希望和平
The King desires peace.

878
01:48:55,998 --> 01:48:57,625
长脚渴望和平？
Longshanks desires peace?

879
01:48:57,733 --> 01:48:59,928
他跟我说的，我发誓
He declares it to me, I swear it.

880
01:49:00,269 --> 01:49:02,533
他提议，你撤退进攻
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

881
01:49:02,805 --> 01:49:06,297
为回报你，他赐你头衔、土地
In return he grants you
title, estates and this

882
01:49:06,409 --> 01:49:09,003
我私人会给你黄金
chest of gold which I am
to pay to you personally.

883
01:49:09,979 --> 01:49:13,142
皇族、头衔及黄金
A lordship and titles, gold...

884
01:49:13,249 --> 01:49:14,807
那我就成了大叛徒
that I should become Judas.

885
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:16,282
和平是这样产生的…
Peace is made in such ways.

886
01:49:16,385 --> 01:49:18,410
奴隶才是这样产生的
Slaves are made in such ways.

887
01:49:21,557 --> 01:49:24,822
长脚上回提和平时我还是孩子
The last time Longshanks
spoke of peace, I was a boy.

888
01:49:25,294 --> 01:49:29,230
许多不愿为奴的贵族都受他诱
Many Scottish nobles who would
not be slaves, were lured by him,

889
01:49:29,332 --> 01:49:31,800
在休战旗下，到谷仓聚会
under a flag of truce, to a barn...

890
01:49:31,968 --> 01:49:34,732
他却在那儿吊死他们
where he had them hanged.

891
01:49:34,937 --> 01:49:37,167
我当时很小
I was very young,

892
01:49:37,273 --> 01:49:40,765
但我记得长脚提到和平
but I remember Longshanks's notion of peace.

893
01:49:43,946 --> 01:49:46,346
我明白你所受的苦痛
I understand you have suffered.

894
01:49:47,483 --> 01:49:49,075
我知道…
I know...

895
01:49:49,285 --> 01:49:51,344
你女人的事
about your woman.

896
01:50:01,531 --> 01:50:02,998
她是我妻子
She was my wife.

897
01:50:06,068 --> 01:50:07,501
我们秘密成婚，因为…
We married in secret because

898
01:50:07,603 --> 01:50:10,197
我不愿与英格兰地主分享她
I would not share her with an English lord.

899
01:50:11,774 --> 01:50:15,039
他们杀她来诱捕我
They killed her... to get to me.

900
01:50:20,016 --> 01:50:22,382
我从未说过
I've never spoken of it.

901
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:27,485
不知道为何告诉，只因…
I don't know why I tell you now, except...

902
01:50:29,725 --> 01:50:32,956
也许在身上看到她的毅力
I see her strength in you.

903
01:50:37,733 --> 01:50:40,702
终有一天，会成为皇后
One day, you'll be a queen.

904
01:50:42,705 --> 01:50:45,572
一定要眼观四面
And you must open your eyes.

905
01:50:51,948 --> 01:50:53,677
去告诉的国王
You tell your King

906
01:50:54,517 --> 01:50:56,542
威廉华莱士不受统治
that William Wallace will not be ruled

907
01:50:57,553 --> 01:51:00,044
苏格兰人也都不会
and nor will any Scot while I live.

908
01:51:32,888 --> 01:51:38,383
我媳妇安返没被异教徒杀了
My son's loyal wife returns
unkilled by the heathen.

909
01:51:38,494 --> 01:51:39,722
那他接受了我们的贿赂？
So he accepted our bribe?

910
01:51:39,829 --> 01:51:42,093
没有，他没接受
No. He did not.

911
01:51:43,265 --> 01:51:45,130
那他为何停顿了？
Then why does he stay?

912
01:51:45,301 --> 01:51:48,361
我的哨兵传达，他未再前进
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

913
01:51:48,471 --> 01:51:50,200
他在约克等你
He waits for you at York.

914
01:51:50,539 --> 01:51:53,406
他说他不再进军攻城
He says he will attack no more towns

915
01:51:53,576 --> 01:51:56,272
只要你有胆去和他会面
if you are man enough to come and face him.

916
01:51:56,379 --> 01:51:58,176
是吗？
Did he?

917
01:51:58,681 --> 01:52:02,913
威尔斯的弓箭手不会被发现
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

918
01:52:03,019 --> 01:52:07,251
已去到他面前
arriving so far around his flank.

919
01:52:07,456 --> 01:52:11,392
从法国调征的主力…
The main force of our armies
from France land here

920
01:52:11,494 --> 01:52:14,554
会在爱丁堡北部登陆
to the north of Edinburgh. Conscripts from

921
01:52:14,664 --> 01:52:19,431
爱尔兰的征兵会自西南方攻进
Ireland will approach from
the southwest to here.

922
01:52:19,602 --> 01:52:20,830
威尔斯的弓箭手…
Welsh bowmen,

923
01:52:20,936 --> 01:52:23,336
法国步兵、爱尔兰征兵…
troops from France, Irish conscripts.

924
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:26,567
就算今天抵达，也需数周纠集
But they'd take weeks to assemble.

925
01:52:26,776 --> 01:52:29,074
我早就支调安排了
I dispatched them...

926
01:52:29,178 --> 01:52:31,578
早在派你妻子去谈判前
before I sent your wife.

927
01:52:35,017 --> 01:52:37,645
我们的策略成功了
So our little ruse succeeded.

928
01:52:37,753 --> 01:52:39,414
谢谢
Thank you.

929
01:52:39,655 --> 01:52:43,591
这自傲家伙在约克等的同时
And while this upstart
awaits my arrival in York,

930
01:52:43,693 --> 01:52:48,596
我的军力会在爱丁堡切断路
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh, behind him.

931
01:52:48,864 --> 01:52:52,322
曾跟这个
You spoke with this...

932
01:52:52,435 --> 01:52:54,266
华莱士
Wallace

933
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:56,031
私底下谈过话
in private?

934
01:52:56,138 --> 01:52:57,765
告诉我
Tell me...

935
01:52:59,275 --> 01:53:01,869
他是一个怎么样的人？
What kind of man is he?

936
01:53:02,578 --> 01:53:05,046
一个没脑的野蛮人
A mindless barbarian.

937
01:53:05,781 --> 01:53:08,841
不像吾王您
Not a king like you, my Lord.

938
01:53:10,152 --> 01:53:13,212
可以回房了
You may return to your embroidery.

939
01:53:13,322 --> 01:53:15,222
是，吾王
Humbly, my Lord.

940
01:53:15,458 --> 01:53:18,552
把钱都带回来了？
You brought back the money?

941
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:23,227
没有
No.

942
01:53:23,499 --> 01:53:26,866
我赠给受此战事扰害的孩童们
I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

943
01:53:28,537 --> 01:53:32,337
这就是派女人办事的后果
That's what happens when you send a woman.

944
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:34,872
原谅我，大人
Forgive me, sire.

945
01:53:34,977 --> 01:53:36,774
原以为此慷慨行为
I thought that generosity might

946
01:53:36,879 --> 01:53:41,816
对您统御之民，更显您德政
demonstrate your greatness
to those you mean to rule.

947
01:53:43,819 --> 01:53:46,413
我德政的昭显
My greatness

948
01:53:46,522 --> 01:53:50,481
是当华莱士滚回苏格兰时
will be better demonstrated when
Wallace returns to Scotland

949
01:53:50,659 --> 01:53:53,719
发现他的国家已成一片灰烬
and finds his country in ashes.

950
01:53:57,633 --> 01:53:59,157
威廉
William.

951
01:53:59,435 --> 01:54:03,371
有骑士来，绝非英格兰军
There's riders approaching.

952
01:54:08,477 --> 01:54:11,310
是王妃的帖身侍女
A personal escort of the Princess.

953
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:12,913
是
Aye.

954
01:54:13,783 --> 01:54:16,377
你的热情让她们念念难忘
Must have made an impression.

955
01:54:16,852 --> 01:54:18,012
是
Aye.

956
01:54:18,387 --> 01:54:20,378
你在帐蓬里没待那么久
I didn't think you were
in the tent that long.

957
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,191
小姐

958
01:54:27,496 --> 01:54:29,396
王妃要我交给你

959
01:54:30,332 --> 01:54:31,822
谢谢

960
01:54:56,325 --> 01:54:57,519
是真的
It's true.

961
01:54:57,626 --> 01:54:59,355
英格兰军船从南方迫进
The English ships are coming from the South.

962
01:54:59,461 --> 01:55:00,826
我不知道威尔斯的情形
I don't know about the Welsh yet,

963
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:02,454
但爱尔兰军已经登陆
but the Irish have landed.

964
01:55:02,698 --> 01:55:05,326
要亲眼看到才会相信
I had to see it myself to believe it.

965
01:55:05,768 --> 01:55:07,963
爱尔兰人为何要帮他们作战？
Why are the Irish fighting with the English?

966
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:09,901
别耽心他们
I wouldn't worry about them.

967
01:55:10,005 --> 01:55:11,632
我不是跟你说过
Didn't I tell you before?

968
01:55:12,041 --> 01:55:14,100
是我的岛
It's my island.

969
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:15,268
汉密
Hamish,

970
01:55:15,377 --> 01:55:17,675
骑马至爱丁堡去召集开会
ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council.

971
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:19,872
命他们集合
- Order it.
- Right. Come on.

972
01:55:23,853 --> 01:55:24,911
你的岛？
Your island?

973
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,647
我的岛！！
My island. Yup.

974
01:55:29,792 --> 01:55:31,384
肃静，各位
Please, gentlemen.

975
01:55:31,493 --> 01:55:34,053
大人，克格说的没错
Lords, Craig is right.

976
01:55:34,163 --> 01:55:36,654
目前只有谈判一途
This time our only option is to negotiate.

977
01:55:36,999 --> 01:55:40,059
除非要爱丁堡之被夷为平地
Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...

978
01:55:46,976 --> 01:55:49,911
军队远征的时日多过我所记忆
My army has marched for many days.

979
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:53,771
我们仍有时间准备，仔细听好
And we still have preparations to
make, so I'll make this plain.

980
01:55:55,551 --> 01:55:57,985
我们召集所有的士兵
We require every soldier you can summon,

981
01:55:58,087 --> 01:56:01,523
帖身侍卫、甚至你自己
your personal escorts, even yourselves.

982
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:03,724
我们现在需要这些兵源
And we need them now.

983
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:08,252
大敌当前，我们必须另谋他策
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

984
01:56:08,364 --> 01:56:10,093
另谋他策？
Other options?

985
01:56:11,367 --> 01:56:15,633
你难道不想带领军队上战场
Don't you wish at least to
lead your men onto the field

986
01:56:15,738 --> 01:56:19,538
与长脚争取更好的条件
and barter a better deal with
Longshanks before you run?

987
01:56:19,642 --> 01:56:20,404
威廉爵士
Sir William...

988
01:56:20,509 --> 01:56:21,601
我们打不过他们
We cannot defeat them.

989
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:22,699
- 我们能
- 威廉爵士
- We can.
- Sir William.

990
01:56:22,811 --> 01:56:24,506
我们也会
And we will.

991
01:56:26,982 --> 01:56:28,711
我们在史特兰一战大捷
We won at Stirling,

992
01:56:28,817 --> 01:56:30,580
而你们仍在发谬论
and still you quibble.

993
01:56:31,553 --> 01:56:33,646
我们大胜约克，你们也没支援
We won at York and you would not support us.

994
01:56:35,057 --> 01:56:38,549
若现在不并肩作战，就是懦夫
If you'll no stand up with us
now, I'd say you're cowards.

995
01:56:44,566 --> 01:56:46,500
你们若是苏格兰人
If you are Scotsmen,

996
01:56:46,635 --> 01:56:49,195
我为自己感到可耻
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

997
01:56:49,338 --> 01:56:51,499
威廉爵士，与我单独谈
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

998
01:56:54,143 --> 01:56:55,872
我求你
I beg you.

999
01:56:59,181 --> 01:57:01,308
你的成就远超过别人所梦想
You've achieved so much,

1000
01:57:01,717 --> 01:57:04,379
但为这些而战，就像是泄愤
but fighting these odds, it looks like rage,

1001
01:57:04,486 --> 01:57:05,475
而非勇气
not courage.

1002
01:57:05,587 --> 01:57:07,521
我的情绪远超过愤怒
It's well beyond rage.

1003
01:57:09,658 --> 01:57:11,592
帮助我
Help me.

1004
01:57:12,728 --> 01:57:15,891
以上天之名，帮助你自己吧
In the name of Christ, help yourselves.

1005
01:57:16,065 --> 01:57:18,192
这是我们的机会
Now is our chance. Now.

1006
01:57:18,767 --> 01:57:20,428
团结就能胜利
If we join, we can win.

1007
01:57:20,536 --> 01:57:23,903
胜利将会带来前所未有的
If we win, we'll have what none
of us have ever had before.

1008
01:57:25,274 --> 01:57:27,504
我们自己的国家
A country of our own.

1009
01:57:28,978 --> 01:57:31,173
你是我国的领袖
You're the rightful leader

1010
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,805
我看到你身上的力量
and there is strength in you, I see it.

1011
01:57:39,054 --> 01:57:40,783
团结我们吧
Unite us.

1012
01:57:43,592 --> 01:57:46,720
团结我们，将各族都团结起来
Unite us. Unite the clans.

1013
01:57:53,302 --> 01:57:55,293
好
- All right.
- Right.

1014
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:03,141
不该是这样
This cannot be the way.

1015
01:58:03,612 --> 01:58:05,546
你自己曾说过
You said yourself

1016
01:58:05,647 --> 01:58:08,707
贵族不会支持华莱士
the nobles will not support Wallace.

1017
01:58:09,985 --> 01:58:14,046
为何要加入被屠杀的一方？
So how does it help us to join
the side that is slaughtered?

1018
01:58:15,057 --> 01:58:17,048
我答应了他
I gave him my word.

1019
01:58:25,367 --> 01:58:27,358
我知道很难
I know it is hard.

1020
01:58:28,003 --> 01:58:31,234
作为一个领袖是很难的
Being a leader is.

1021
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:32,830
孩子
My son...

1022
01:58:33,609 --> 01:58:35,372
孩子…
Son...

1023
01:58:35,544 --> 01:58:37,205
看着我
Look at me.

1024
01:58:43,752 --> 01:58:45,811
我不能当国王
I cannot be King.

1025
01:58:46,388 --> 01:58:49,551
你一人可以统治苏格兰
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

1026
01:58:50,025 --> 01:58:52,459
我所说的，你一定要办到
What I tell you, you must do.

1027
01:58:52,761 --> 01:58:55,229
不是为我，不是为你自己
Not for me, not for yourself,

1028
01:58:55,497 --> 01:58:57,658
是为了你国家
but for your country.

1029
01:58:59,701 --> 01:59:02,169
福克

1030
01:59:13,715 --> 01:59:15,012
让开，孩子们
Right, lads, make way.

1031
01:59:15,284 --> 01:59:16,376
借过
Coming through.

1032
01:59:23,325 --> 01:59:24,815
让开，孩子们
Make way, lads.

1033
01:59:30,466 --> 01:59:32,525
布鲁士不来了，威廉
The Bruce is not coming, William.

1034
01:59:33,402 --> 01:59:34,767
他会来的
He'll come.

1035
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:38,001
莫瑞与卢克兰都到了
Mornay and Lochlan have come.

1036
01:59:40,375 --> 01:59:41,706
他一定会到
So will the Bruce.

1037
01:59:45,481 --> 01:59:49,076
好一个聚会
Quite a lovely... gathering.

1038
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:51,743
同意吗？
Wouldn't you agree?

1039
01:59:55,491 --> 01:59:57,118
弓箭手已准备好
The archers are ready, sire.

1040
01:59:57,259 --> 01:59:58,988
现在别派弓箭手
Not the archers.

1041
01:59:59,094 --> 02:00:02,257
哨兵报说弓箭手在数里远
My scouts say their archers
are miles away and no threat.

1042
02:00:02,464 --> 02:00:03,692
箭耗钱
Arrows cost money.

1043
02:00:03,799 --> 02:00:05,426
先让爱尔兰人上阵
Use up the Irish.

1044
02:00:05,534 --> 02:00:06,558
死人不要钱
The dead cost nothing.

1045
02:00:06,802 --> 02:00:09,236
先派步兵与骑兵
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

1046
02:00:09,805 --> 02:00:11,329
步兵队
lnfantry.

1047
02:00:13,175 --> 02:00:16,440
骑兵队
Cavalry.

1048
02:00:18,347 --> 02:00:19,974
前进
Advance.

1049
02:01:46,301 --> 02:01:48,792
各位早
Good to see ye this morning.

1050
02:01:51,139 --> 02:01:52,731
典型的爱尔兰人
Irish!

1051
02:01:53,108 --> 02:01:54,439
很高兴你与我们一起
Glad to have ye with us.

1052
02:01:54,676 --> 02:01:55,574
看这
Watch this.

1053
02:04:06,908 --> 02:04:08,933
莫瑞？卢克兰？
Mornay? Lochlan?

1054
02:04:09,044 --> 02:04:13,845
我将两倍大的土地赐给莫瑞
I gave Mornay double his lands in
Scotland and matching estates in England.

1055
02:04:14,049 --> 02:04:18,315
卢克兰索求的就少的多
Lochlan turned... for much less.

1056
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:19,885
弓箭手
Archers.

1057
02:04:20,155 --> 02:04:23,147
大人，这样会杀到本军？
I beg your pardon, sire?
Won't we hit our own troops?

1058
02:04:25,127 --> 02:04:26,526
对
Yes.

1059
02:04:26,862 --> 02:04:28,921
但也会杀到敌军
But we'll hit theirs as well.

1060
02:04:29,030 --> 02:04:30,793
我们仍有得赚
We have reserves.

1061
02:04:32,167 --> 02:04:33,464
进攻！
Attack.

1062
02:04:34,703 --> 02:04:38,867
弓箭手！
Archers.

1063
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:15,866
派出援军
Send in our reinforcements.

1064
02:05:16,545 --> 02:05:18,035
将部队全派出
Send in the rest.

1065
02:05:28,757 --> 02:05:30,486
把华莱士带来给我
Bring me Wallace.

1066
02:05:31,193 --> 02:05:32,421
尽可能…活捉
Alive, if possible.

1067
02:05:32,527 --> 02:05:33,653
死了…
Dead...

1068
02:05:33,962 --> 02:05:35,156
也可以
just as good.

1069
02:05:35,931 --> 02:05:37,865
将我们战胜的消息传出
Send us news of our victory.

1070
02:05:38,366 --> 02:05:40,129
走了吧？
Shall we retire?

1071
02:07:04,886 --> 02:07:06,353
保护国王
Protect the King.

1072
02:09:10,445 --> 02:09:11,673
起来！
Get up.

1073
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,338
起来！

1074
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:17,750
起来！
Get up.

1075
02:09:18,687 --> 02:09:19,745
把他带走
Get him out of here.

1076
02:09:20,021 --> 02:09:20,919
天！
Jesus.

1077
02:09:25,326 --> 02:09:26,691
走！
Go.

1078
02:10:27,489 --> 02:10:29,081
我快死了
I'm dying.

1079
02:10:32,627 --> 02:10:34,185
别照顾我
Let me be.

1080
02:10:39,834 --> 02:10:41,426
不…
No.

1081
02:10:42,337 --> 02:10:44,032
你会活的
You're going to live.

1082
02:10:46,074 --> 02:10:48,872
我自由地活得够久了
I've lived long enough to live free.

1083
02:10:49,711 --> 02:10:51,838
我很骄傲
Proud...

1084
02:10:51,946 --> 02:10:54,710
看到你成人
to see you become the man you are.

1085
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:01,220
我很快乐
I'm a happy man.

1086
02:12:50,665 --> 02:12:53,532
我是个风烛残年的人
I'm the one who's rotting.

1087
02:12:53,835 --> 02:12:57,669
但你的脸色比我更灰败
But I think your face looks graver than mine.

1088
02:13:01,776 --> 02:13:03,073
儿子
Son...

1089
02:13:09,317 --> 02:13:13,344
我们必须联合英格兰
We must have alliance with
England to prevail here.

1090
02:13:13,955 --> 02:13:16,389
做到这点
You achieved that.

1091
02:13:16,491 --> 02:13:18,425
你就保住了自己
You saved your family

1092
02:13:18,526 --> 02:13:20,221
增加你的土地
and increased your land.

1093
02:13:20,628 --> 02:13:25,190
假以时日，在苏格兰就有权
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

1094
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:26,867
土地…
Lands.

1095
02:13:26,968 --> 02:13:29,198
衔头…人民…
Titles. Men.

1096
02:13:29,304 --> 02:13:30,566
权力
Power.

1097
02:13:30,672 --> 02:13:31,832
对我都已无意义
Nothing.

1098
02:13:31,940 --> 02:13:32,770
无意义？
Nothing?

1099
02:13:32,874 --> 02:13:34,432
我什么都没了
I have nothing.

1100
02:13:35,610 --> 02:13:37,703
人为我而战…
Men fight for me

1101
02:13:37,812 --> 02:13:40,781
若不如此，我就驱逐他们
because if they do not
I throw them off my land

1102
02:13:40,882 --> 02:13:42,679
让他们的家庭受饥
and I starve their wives and their children.

1103
02:13:43,584 --> 02:13:45,552
那些人…
Those men

1104
02:13:45,753 --> 02:13:48,586
在福克血流成河
who bled the ground red at Falkirk...

1105
02:13:50,191 --> 02:13:52,955
他们为威廉华莱士而战
They fought for William
Wallace, and he fights

1106
02:13:53,328 --> 02:13:56,957
他为我从未有过的自由而战
for something that I've never had.

1107
02:13:58,066 --> 02:14:02,230
我背叛他，夺去他的自由
And I took it from him when I 
betrayed him and I saw it in his face

1108
02:14:02,337 --> 02:14:04,168
我在战场上看到他的表情
on the battlefield.

1109
02:14:04,339 --> 02:14:06,830
让我无地自容
And it's tearing me apart.

1110
02:14:07,141 --> 02:14:09,336
人都会背叛
Well, all men betray.

1111
02:14:09,444 --> 02:14:10,206
都会心如死灰
All lose heart.

1112
02:14:10,311 --> 02:14:12,370
我不想
I don't want to lose heart.

1113
02:14:16,884 --> 02:14:19,284
我想要相信…
I want to believe...

1114
02:14:19,387 --> 02:14:21,617
他的所为
as he does.

1115
02:14:27,395 --> 02:14:30,728
我不要再选择错误
I will never be on the wrong side again.

1116
02:15:20,014 --> 02:15:22,005
No.

1117
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:21,702
莫瑞的事是否真的
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

1118
02:16:21,809 --> 02:16:23,242
是的
Aye.

1119
02:16:24,445 --> 02:16:27,437
华莱士冲进来杀了他
Wallace rode into his
bedchamber and killed him.

1120
02:16:27,548 --> 02:16:29,709
现在的他比从前更利害
More of a liability now than ever he was.

1121
02:16:30,384 --> 02:16:31,942
不知道下一个会是谁
And there's no telling who'll be next.

1122
02:16:35,156 --> 02:16:36,680
也许是你
Maybe you.

1123
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:40,487
也许我
Maybe me.

1124
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:47,561
都没关系
It doesn't matter.

1125
02:16:49,604 --> 02:16:50,832
我很认真的，罗拔
I'm serious, Robert.

1126
02:16:51,139 --> 02:16:52,800
我也一样！！！
So am I.

1127
02:17:05,319 --> 02:17:07,119
Christ. Shit.

1128
02:17:08,122 --> 02:17:09,885
搜查这地方
Search the place.

1129
02:17:13,161 --> 02:17:14,753
是卢克兰
Lochlan.

1130
02:17:21,102 --> 02:17:23,696
威廉华莱士杀了五十人
William Wallace killed 50 men.

1131
02:17:24,672 --> 02:17:26,663
在战胜后杀了五十人
50 if it was one.

1132
02:17:26,774 --> 02:17:27,934
杀了一百人
100 men...

1133
02:17:28,242 --> 02:17:29,607
用他的剑
with his own sword.

1134
02:17:30,211 --> 02:17:31,473
他杀他们如…
Cut through them like...

1135
02:17:31,579 --> 02:17:34,309
摩西穿过的红海
Moses through the Red Sea.

1136
02:18:07,181 --> 02:18:09,240
他的传奇在各处成长
His legend grows.

1137
02:18:09,350 --> 02:18:11,011
这会比先前还差
It will be worse than before.

1138
02:18:11,118 --> 02:18:14,713
他在苏格兰各城征召志愿军
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town.

1139
02:18:15,489 --> 02:18:16,581
当…
When he replenishes his numbers...

1140
02:18:16,691 --> 02:18:20,092
他们是羊…只是羔羊而已
They're sheep. Mere sheep.

1141
02:18:21,996 --> 02:18:25,159
杀了牧羊人就很容易分散
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

1142
02:18:25,533 --> 02:18:26,693
好吧
Very well.

1143
02:18:27,935 --> 02:18:32,497
挑选个最好的刺客，安排会议
Pick a flock of your finest
assassins and set a meeting.

1144
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:36,872
华莱士对暗算更敏锐了
My Lord, Wallace is renowned for
his ability to smell an ambush.

1145
02:18:40,248 --> 02:18:44,412
若汉默顿爵士告诉我的属实
If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct

1146
02:18:44,518 --> 02:18:48,682
他对未来女皇钟情，会相信她
he warmed to our future
Queen and would trust her.

1147
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:53,387
派她去表达和平之意
So we'll dispatch her with the
notion that she comes in peace.

1148
02:18:53,494 --> 02:18:58,329
但王妃会陷为人质，生命不保
My Lord, the Princess might be taken
hostage or her life be put in jeopardy.

1149
02:18:58,499 --> 02:19:02,731
我儿子会悲叹不已
My son would be most distressed by that.

1150
02:19:03,137 --> 02:19:04,468
但事实是…
But in truth

1151
02:19:04,572 --> 02:19:06,767
她若遇害…
if she were to be killed,

1152
02:19:07,008 --> 02:19:12,674
法国会成为盟国来对付苏格兰
we would soon find the King of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

1153
02:19:14,115 --> 02:19:15,673
懂吧
You see...

1154
02:19:15,783 --> 02:19:17,512
身为国王
As King,

1155
02:19:17,618 --> 02:19:21,884
一定要在各方面寻求最佳办法
you must find the good in any situation.

1156
02:19:48,149 --> 02:19:50,117
是威廉华莱士，我确定
It's William Wallace, sure.

1157
02:19:50,918 --> 02:19:52,943
他已收起剑
And he's given up his sword.

1158
02:19:53,954 --> 02:19:54,921
准备好
Be ready.

1159
02:21:34,588 --> 02:21:35,646
王妃殿下
My Lady.

1160
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:41,660
我接到的信讯
I received your message.

1161
02:21:54,608 --> 02:21:56,303
这是…
This is...

1162
02:21:56,944 --> 02:21:59,412
第二次警告我
the second time you've warned me of danger.

1163
02:22:01,248 --> 02:22:02,476
为什么？
Why?

1164
02:22:03,284 --> 02:22:06,481
新的补给下个月会从北方运到
There will be a new shipment of
supplies coming north next month.

1165
02:22:06,587 --> 02:22:08,350
粮食、武器会…
Foods and weapons. They will...

1166
02:22:08,589 --> 02:22:10,022
别说了
No, stop.

1167
02:22:12,293 --> 02:22:13,885
为何要帮我？
Why do you help me?

1168
02:22:20,534 --> 02:22:21,967
为什么帮我？
Why do you help me?

1169
02:22:23,671 --> 02:22:26,333
因为你现在看我的眼神
Because of the way you are looking at me now.

1170
02:24:18,986 --> 02:24:21,477
正当我们以为希望尽失时
Just when we thought all hope was lost,

1171
02:24:21,589 --> 02:24:24,319
我们尊贵的救世主就来了
our noble saviors have arrived.

1172
02:24:27,461 --> 02:24:29,452
取下头巾
Off with their hoods.

1173
02:24:33,968 --> 02:24:37,028
威廉爵士，我们来此谈判
Sir William, we come to seek a meeting.

1174
02:24:37,204 --> 02:24:38,762
有何目的？
Well, what's the point?

1175
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:42,365
你们向长脚效忠
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1176
02:24:42,509 --> 02:24:45,137
宣誓对骗子而言不是誓约
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1177
02:24:45,245 --> 02:24:47,406
我们决定向你效忠
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1178
02:24:47,514 --> 02:24:49,880
让议会表明效忠
So let the council swear publicly.

1179
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:51,381
我们不能
We cannot.

1180
02:24:51,518 --> 02:24:53,509
有些人不相信你仍活着
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1181
02:24:53,787 --> 02:24:56,278
认为他们会如莫瑞的下场般
Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.

1182
02:24:56,757 --> 02:24:58,122
来爱丁堡…
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1183
02:24:58,325 --> 02:25:00,555
两日后来，向我们求恕
Meet us two days from now.
Pledge us your pardon

1184
02:25:00,661 --> 02:25:03,459
我们支持你，苏格兰将统一
and we'll unite behind
you. Scotland will be one.

1185
02:25:03,564 --> 02:25:04,724
统一？
One?

1186
02:25:04,832 --> 02:25:05,924
你是指我们和你们？
You mean us and you.

1187
02:25:06,033 --> 02:25:07,432
不
No.

1188
02:25:09,003 --> 02:25:10,664
我是指这个
I mean this.

1189
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:15,206
这是罗拔布鲁士的信物
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1190
02:25:24,885 --> 02:25:27,376
你明知这是陷阱，跟他说
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

1191
02:25:27,621 --> 02:25:31,216
若罗拔要杀你，在福克便动手
If the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it at Falkirk.

1192
02:25:32,159 --> 02:25:33,751
我知道，我见到
I know. I saw.

1193
02:25:33,861 --> 02:25:35,192
别理会他
All right, leaving him aside,

1194
02:25:35,763 --> 02:25:37,094
其他人呢？
what about the others?

1195
02:25:37,364 --> 02:25:39,127
全是一丘之貉
Scheming bastards

1196
02:25:39,233 --> 02:25:41,599
他们连屎的颜色都有意见
who couldnae agree on the color of shite.

1197
02:25:41,702 --> 02:25:42,760
这是陷阱
It's a trap. Are you blind?

1198
02:25:42,870 --> 02:25:44,462
看看我们自己
Look at us.

1199
02:25:45,539 --> 02:25:46,972
我们一定要试
We've got to try.

1200
02:25:47,074 --> 02:25:48,632
我们不能单独行事
We can't do this alone.

1201
02:25:49,810 --> 02:25:52,404
加盟贵族是唯一机会
Joining the nobles is our only hope.

1202
02:25:52,513 --> 02:25:54,071
若不做，你知道结果会如何？
You know what happens if we don't?

1203
02:25:54,181 --> 02:25:55,546
会怎么样？
What?

1204
02:25:55,783 --> 02:25:57,375
什么都没有
Nothing.

1205
02:25:58,986 --> 02:26:00,578
我不是烈士
I don't want to be a martyr.

1206
02:26:01,488 --> 02:26:02,716
我也不是
Nor I.

1207
02:26:02,823 --> 02:26:04,313
我想活
I want to live.

1208
02:26:04,725 --> 02:26:06,886
我想成家生子
I want a home, and children.

1209
02:26:06,994 --> 02:26:08,222
想平安你想吗？
And peace. Do ye?

1210
02:26:08,328 --> 02:26:09,556
我想
Aye, I do.

1211
02:26:09,663 --> 02:26:11,631
我向上帝祈求这些
I've asked God for those things.

1212
02:26:12,366 --> 02:26:14,561
但失去自由，什么也都不是
It's all for nothing if
you don't have freedom.

1213
02:26:14,668 --> 02:26:15,600
那只是梦想
It's just a dream, William.

1214
02:26:15,703 --> 02:26:17,136
梦想？
A dream? Just a...

1215
02:26:18,505 --> 02:26:21,872
我们所做的这一切算什么？
Well, then, what have we
been doing all this time?

1216
02:26:23,143 --> 02:26:25,008
我们靠这梦想而活
We've lived that dream.

1217
02:26:25,112 --> 02:26:26,841
你的梦想不是自由
Your dream isn't about freedom.

1218
02:26:27,047 --> 02:26:28,810
是茉朗
It's about Murron.

1219
02:26:28,916 --> 02:26:31,749
你想当英雄，认为她在看你
You're doing this to be a hero
because you think she sees ye.

1220
02:26:31,919 --> 02:26:34,547
我知道她在看着我
I don't think she sees me. I know she does.

1221
02:26:35,289 --> 02:26:37,223
你的父亲也在看着你
And your father sees you, too.

1222
02:26:47,468 --> 02:26:48,799
天
Jesus.

1223
02:26:51,271 --> 02:26:53,034
起来，抓好了

1224
02:26:56,577 --> 02:26:57,805
要我跟你一起去吗？
Shall I come with you?

1225
02:26:59,613 --> 02:27:00,773
不
No.

1226
02:27:01,482 --> 02:27:02,710
我自己去
I'll go alone.

1227
02:27:04,384 --> 02:27:06,113
谈判完了再见
I'll see you after.

1228
02:27:12,226 --> 02:27:14,888
希望愈早见愈好
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1229
02:27:21,135 --> 02:27:22,033
他不会来
He won't come.

1230
02:27:22,136 --> 02:27:23,103
他会来的
He will.

1231
02:27:24,605 --> 02:27:25,594
我知道他会来的
I know he will.

1232
02:27:40,621 --> 02:27:42,384
大人，他来了
My Lord. He approaches.

1233
02:28:26,333 --> 02:28:27,823
不！
No!

1234
02:28:32,906 --> 02:28:34,237
别介入
Stay out of it, Robert.

1235
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:38,371
Get away.

1236
02:28:41,882 --> 02:28:43,281
别伤他！
The Bruce is not to be harmed,

1237
02:28:43,383 --> 02:28:44,680
这是协定
that's the arrangement.

1238
02:28:53,026 --> 02:28:54,789
父亲
Father!

1239
02:29:00,567 --> 02:29:04,059
你这该死的混蛋
You rotting bastard!

1240
02:29:04,171 --> 02:29:06,036
为什么？为什么？
Why?

1241
02:29:10,611 --> 02:29:13,444
长脚要抓华莱士
Longshanks required Wallace.

1242
02:29:14,081 --> 02:29:15,912
我们贵族也要
So did our nobles.

1243
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:19,581
那就是你皇冠的代价
That was the price of your crown.

1244
02:29:19,686 --> 02:29:21,119
去死吧！
Die.

1245
02:29:22,456 --> 02:29:23,980
我要你死！
I want you to die.

1246
02:29:24,358 --> 02:29:26,519
我迟早会死的
Soon enough I'll be dead.

1247
02:29:26,894 --> 02:29:28,657
你就会当王
And you'll be King.

1248
02:29:28,762 --> 02:29:30,855
我对你无所求
I don't want anything from you.

1249
02:29:31,465 --> 02:29:32,989
你不是人
You're not a man.

1250
02:29:34,334 --> 02:29:35,699
你不是我父亲
And you're not my father.

1251
02:29:40,207 --> 02:29:42,266
你是我儿子
You're my son

1252
02:29:42,476 --> 02:29:44,774
你一直了解我心意
and you have always known my mind.

1253
02:29:46,847 --> 02:29:48,337
你欺骗我
You deceived me.

1254
02:29:48,448 --> 02:29:50,848
你让自己被欺瞒
You let yourself be deceived.

1255
02:29:51,018 --> 02:29:55,045
在你心中，你一直清楚情况
In your heart, you always
knew what had to happen here.

1256
02:29:57,991 --> 02:29:59,481
终于…
At last,

1257
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:01,651
你了解仇恨的真义
you know what it means to hate.

1258
02:30:05,933 --> 02:30:09,096
你为成为国王作好准备
Now you're ready to be a king.

1259
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:11,970
我的恨…
My hate...

1260
02:30:12,072 --> 02:30:14,870
将与你共亡
will die with you.

1261
02:30:19,613 --> 02:30:21,205
威廉华莱士
William Wallace,

1262
02:30:21,348 --> 02:30:23,976
你被控叛逆
you stand in taint of high treason.

1263
02:30:24,985 --> 02:30:26,350
对谁？
Against whom?

1264
02:30:26,453 --> 02:30:27,977
对你的国王
Against your King.

1265
02:30:29,456 --> 02:30:31,321
有何辩解？
Have you anything to say?

1266
02:30:32,392 --> 02:30:34,758
在我一生当中…
Never in my whole life

1267
02:30:36,029 --> 02:30:38,827
从未向他宣誓效忠过
did I swear allegiance to him.

1268
02:30:39,733 --> 02:30:41,098
那无所谓
It matters not.

1269
02:30:41,501 --> 02:30:43,059
他是你的国王
He is your King.

1270
02:30:45,339 --> 02:30:46,533
招供的话
Confess

1271
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:48,699
可让你速死
and you may receive a quick death.

1272
02:30:49,176 --> 02:30:52,304
否认的话，让你从苦刑中忏悔
Deny and you must be purified by pain.

1273
02:30:52,412 --> 02:30:53,845
要坦供吗？
Do you confess?

1274
02:30:55,949 --> 02:30:59,578
你要坦供吗？
Do you confess?

1275
02:31:04,925 --> 02:31:08,793
明天让你受苦刑
Then on the morrow you shall
receive your purification.

1276
02:31:20,741 --> 02:31:21,605
陛下
Your Highness.

1277
02:31:21,708 --> 02:31:22,538
我要见犯人
I will see the prisoner.

1278
02:31:22,642 --> 02:31:23,768
我们收到命令…
The King ordered...

1279
02:31:23,877 --> 02:31:26,277
国王快死了，王子是个懦夫
The King will die soon and his son is weak.

1280
02:31:26,380 --> 02:31:28,678
你想将由谁统治这王国？
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

1281
02:31:29,016 --> 02:31:30,449
快开门
Now open this door.

1282
02:31:32,953 --> 02:31:34,181
陛下
Your Majesty.

1283
02:31:40,660 --> 02:31:42,651
站起来，脏人
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

1284
02:31:42,796 --> 02:31:44,058
住手
Stop it.

1285
02:31:45,098 --> 02:31:46,258
退下
Leave me.

1286
02:31:47,401 --> 02:31:48,993
我说，退下
I said leave me.

1287
02:32:02,149 --> 02:32:03,707
王妃殿下
My Lady.

1288
02:32:04,518 --> 02:32:05,780
大人…
Sir...

1289
02:32:07,187 --> 02:32:09,018
我来求你
I come to beg you...

1290
02:32:10,757 --> 02:32:14,022
坦供一切，向国王宣誓效忠
to confess all and swear allegiance
to the King that he might

1291
02:32:14,127 --> 02:32:15,424
他会饶你的
show you mercy.

1292
02:32:16,430 --> 02:32:18,728
他会饶过苏格兰吗？
Will he show mercy to my country?

1293
02:32:19,733 --> 02:32:22,167
饶你就是让你快点死
Mercy is to die quickly,

1294
02:32:22,269 --> 02:32:24,134
也许将你关在塔上
perhaps even live in the Tower.

1295
02:32:24,237 --> 02:32:26,467
假以时日，也许会有转机
In time, who knows what can happen?

1296
02:32:28,442 --> 02:32:30,171
只要你能活着
If you can only live...

1297
02:32:34,915 --> 02:32:36,542
若我向他宣誓
If I swear to him...

1298
02:32:37,517 --> 02:32:39,678
那样的我…
then all that I am...

1299
02:32:39,786 --> 02:32:41,617
等于早死了
is dead already.

1300
02:32:50,263 --> 02:32:52,823
你若死了，一切会更惨
You will die. It will be awful.

1301
02:32:52,966 --> 02:32:54,661
所有人都会死
Every man dies.

1302
02:32:57,370 --> 02:32:59,531
但不是每个人都能活
Not every man really lives.

1303
02:33:05,912 --> 02:33:07,436
喝这
Drink this.

1304
02:33:08,782 --> 02:33:10,682
会缓和你的痛苦
It will dull your pain.

1305
02:33:11,051 --> 02:33:13,747
不，会麻木我的智慧
No. It will numb my wits.

1306
02:33:13,854 --> 02:33:15,481
我现在必须要清醒
And I must have them all.

1307
02:33:16,256 --> 02:33:19,316
我若神智不清或哀泣
For if I'm senseless or if I wail

1308
02:33:19,426 --> 02:33:21,724
长脚就会驯服我
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1309
02:33:21,895 --> 02:33:24,489
我不能忍受见你受苦
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1310
02:33:25,265 --> 02:33:27,130
喝下
Take it.

1311
02:33:31,738 --> 02:33:33,399
好吧
All right.

1312
02:34:20,420 --> 02:34:25,653
我来为威廉华莱士求饶
I have come to beg for the
life of William Wallace.

1313
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:29,594
真的很喜欢他
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1314
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:31,529
我尊敬他
I respect him.

1315
02:34:33,733 --> 02:34:35,257
最起码，他是个可敬的敌人
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1316
02:34:35,368 --> 02:34:37,558
宽恕他，陛下
Show mercy, O thou great King,

1317
02:34:38,170 --> 02:34:40,371
赢取民心
and win the respect of your own people.

1318
02:34:49,849 --> 02:34:51,248
直到现在…
Even now

1319
02:34:52,652 --> 02:34:55,086
你仍不懂宽恕
you are incapable of mercy.

1320
02:35:01,561 --> 02:35:02,926
至于你…
And you...

1321
02:35:07,167 --> 02:35:10,933
这字眼与爱都是你所不熟悉的
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1322
02:35:11,171 --> 02:35:13,605
在他失去说话能力前
Before he lost his powers of speech

1323
02:35:13,707 --> 02:35:17,973
他曾说知道华莱士死掉才安心
he told me his one comfort was that he
would live to know Wallace was dead.

1324
02:35:37,097 --> 02:35:38,530
你知道…
You see?

1325
02:35:40,367 --> 02:35:42,892
我们都会死的
Death comes to us all.

1326
02:35:52,279 --> 02:35:55,214
但在你死之前…
But before it comes to you,

1327
02:35:55,615 --> 02:35:57,947
要清楚
know this:

1328
02:35:58,051 --> 02:36:00,849
你的血肉与你一同死去
Your blood dies with you.

1329
02:36:02,622 --> 02:36:06,718
一个非你骨肉的孩子在我肚内
A child who is not of your
line grows in my belly.

1330
02:36:07,694 --> 02:36:12,961
你儿子不会长占王位，我保证
Your son will not sit long
on the throne, I swear it.

1331
02:36:50,637 --> 02:36:52,628
我好怕…
I'm so afraid.

1332
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:02,373
请赐我力量…
Give me the strength...

1333
02:37:03,450 --> 02:37:04,974
好好的死
to die well.

1334
02:37:29,008 --> 02:37:30,737
他来了
Here he comes.

1335
02:38:59,466 --> 02:39:02,902
我们看叛国的代价
Now behold the awful price of treason.

1336
02:39:09,209 --> 02:39:11,439
或你现在跪下来
Or fall to your knees now,

1337
02:39:13,379 --> 02:39:16,348
向国王效忠
declare yourself the King's loyal subject

1338
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:19,648
求他宽恕
and beg his mercy

1339
02:39:26,059 --> 02:39:28,391
他会饶你的
and you shall have it.

1340
02:39:39,672 --> 02:39:40,730
绳子
Rope.

1341
02:39:53,553 --> 02:39:54,645
扶他
Raise him.

1342
02:40:03,162 --> 02:40:04,595
拉起他！
Stretch him.

1343
02:40:06,833 --> 02:40:08,824
That's it.

1344
02:40:08,902 --> 02:40:10,995
Stretch him.

1345
02:40:47,307 --> 02:40:49,468
愉快吧
Pleasant, yes?

1346
02:40:52,579 --> 02:40:54,672
跪下
Rise to your knees.

1347
02:40:54,781 --> 02:40:57,181
亲我衣袍上的皇徽
Kiss the royal emblem on my cloak

1348
02:40:57,584 --> 02:40:59,848
你将不会再有感觉
and you will feel no more.

1349
02:41:41,094 --> 02:41:42,493
勒他
Rack him.

1350
02:42:37,116 --> 02:42:38,640
够了吗？
Enough?

1351
02:43:31,604 --> 02:43:34,300
可以全结束掉
It can all end...

1352
02:43:34,407 --> 02:43:36,068
立刻结束
right now.

1353
02:43:36,242 --> 02:43:37,971
可感到喜悦
Peace.

1354
02:43:38,811 --> 02:43:40,676
喜悦
Bliss.

1355
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:42,611
只要你说出
Just say it.

1356
02:43:43,249 --> 02:43:45,046
说出来
Cry out...

1357
02:43:45,485 --> 02:43:46,884
饶恕
"Mercy."

1358
02:43:56,162 --> 02:43:57,527
饶恕

1359
02:43:58,865 --> 02:44:05,566
饶恕！饶恕！
Mercy. Mercy.

1360
02:44:05,671 --> 02:44:06,797
叫出来吧
Cry out.

1361
02:44:13,315 --> 02:44:15,180
快说
Just say it.

1361
02:44:15,815 --> 02:44:17,180
饶恕
"Mercy."

1362
02:44:40,439 --> 02:44:43,431
饶恕，威廉，饶恕
Mercy, William. Mercy.

1363
02:44:43,543 --> 02:44:45,067
他就是不说
Jesus, man, say it.

1364
02:44:46,546 --> 02:44:50,482
天啊…

1365
02:44:50,850 --> 02:44:54,377
犯人想说话
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1366
02:45:14,140 --> 02:45:23,811
自由万岁！！
Freedom!

1367
02:47:09,722 --> 02:47:12,088
班诺本斩首后
After the beheading,

1368
02:47:12,224 --> 02:47:15,990
威廉华莱士被分尸
William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.

1369
02:47:18,264 --> 02:47:21,427
他的头被悬挂在伦敦桥
His head was set on London Bridge.

1370
02:47:22,768 --> 02:47:25,134
他的手与腿
His arms and legs

1371
02:47:25,237 --> 02:47:29,867
分送至不列颠四方，作为警惕
sent to the four corners
of Britain as a warning.

1372
02:47:30,643 --> 02:47:35,376
但未如长脚想的取得成效
It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.

1373
02:47:36,215 --> 02:47:39,651
至于我…罗拔布鲁士
And I, Robert the Bruce,

1374
02:47:39,752 --> 02:47:44,553
曾向英王的军队臣服
rode out to pay homage to the
armies of the English King

1375
02:47:44,724 --> 02:47:48,626
接受他对我王位的认可
and accept his endorsement of my crown.

1376
02:47:48,728 --> 02:47:51,356
希望你今天有洗屁股
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.

1377
02:47:51,464 --> 02:47:53,932
苏王会亲的
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1378
02:48:23,362 --> 02:48:26,661
来，来做个了结吧
Come. Let's get it over with.

1379
02:48:38,077 --> 02:48:39,339
停
Stop.

1380
02:48:57,329 --> 02:49:00,230
你们曾与华莱士流血作战
You have bled with Wallace!

1381
02:49:05,538 --> 02:49:07,904
现在跟我淌血吧
Now bleed with me.

1382
02:49:47,913 --> 02:49:57,788
华莱士！
Wallace!

1383
02:50:14,707 --> 02:50:18,108
1314年…
In the year of our Lord 1314,

1384
02:50:18,577 --> 02:50:22,172
苏格兰的爱国志士以寡击众
patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,

1385
02:50:22,381 --> 02:50:25,009
在班诺本战场上作战
charged the fields of Bannockburn.

1386
02:50:26,018 --> 02:50:28,578
他们像战士般在战
They fought like warrior poets.

1387
02:50:28,854 --> 02:50:31,049
像苏格兰人般在战
They fought like Scotsmen

1388
02:50:32,091 --> 02:50:34,355
他们赢取了自由
and won their freedom.
