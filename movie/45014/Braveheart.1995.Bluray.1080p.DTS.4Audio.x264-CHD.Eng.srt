1
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:42,547
I shall tell you of William Wallace.

2
00:01:43,685 --> 00:01:46,552
Historians from England will say I am a liar.

3
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:51,019
But history is written by those who have hanged heroes.

4
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:56,920
The King of Scotland had died without a son. And the King of England,

5
00:01:57,032 --> 00:02:00,866
a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks,

6
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:04,972
claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.

7
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,941
Scotland's nobles fought him

8
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,069
and fought each other over the crown.

9
00:02:11,746 --> 00:02:15,443
So Longshanks invited them to talks of a truce.

10
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,485
No weapons. One page only.

11
00:02:22,857 --> 00:02:27,556
One farmer of that shire was Malcolm Wallace, a commoner with his own lands.

12
00:02:27,629 --> 00:02:30,860
He had two sons: John and William.

13
00:02:37,706 --> 00:02:39,799
l told you to stay.

14
00:02:40,975 --> 00:02:44,001
Well, l finished my work. Where are we going?

15
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,310
MacAndrews'. He was supposed to visit after the gathering.

16
00:02:47,415 --> 00:02:49,440
- Can l come? - No. Go home, boy.

17
00:02:49,517 --> 00:02:53,248
- But l want to go. - Go home, or you'll feel the back of my hand.

18
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:56,051
Away hame, William.

19
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:22,140
MacAndrews.

20
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,424
Holy Jesus.

21
00:04:22,977 --> 00:04:25,070
William.

22
00:04:28,683 --> 00:04:31,584
lt's all right, it's all right. Easy, lad.

23
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,160
William.

24
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,532
And l say we hit back now.

25
00:04:53,608 --> 00:04:56,577
- We cannae fight them. - Something's got to be done.

26
00:04:57,111 --> 00:04:59,807
Wallace is right. We fight them.

27
00:04:59,914 --> 00:05:02,712
Every nobleman willing to fight was at that meeting.

28
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:06,151
We cannot beat an army. Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.

29
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:09,315
We do not have to beat them... Just fight them.

30
00:05:09,424 --> 00:05:12,655
- Now, who's with me? - l am, Wallace.

31
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:16,457
- All right. - Aye.

32
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,405
- Where do you think you're going? - With you.

33
00:05:34,482 --> 00:05:38,077
Och, are ye? And what are you going to do?

34
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:41,553
- l'm gonna help. - Aye, and a good help you'll be, too.

35
00:05:43,591 --> 00:05:45,855
But l need you to stay here

36
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,054
and look after the place for me while l'm away.

37
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:53,359
l can fight.

38
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:58,701
l know. l know you can fight.

39
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:06,472
But it's our wits that make us men.

40
00:06:11,586 --> 00:06:13,645
See ye tomorrow.

41
00:06:44,652 --> 00:06:47,052
- English. - Get down.

42
00:06:47,121 --> 00:06:51,490
With your father and brother gone, they'll kill us and burn the farm.

43
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:54,219
lt's up to us, Hamish.

44
00:07:58,926 --> 00:08:00,985
Da?

45
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:23,067
William.

46
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,872
Come here, lad.

47
00:12:53,654 --> 00:12:55,417
William.

48
00:12:57,224 --> 00:13:00,125
l'm your uncle. Argyle.

49
00:13:13,107 --> 00:13:15,200
You have the look of your mother.

50
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:30,117
We'll stay here tonight. Tomorrow, you'll come home with me.

51
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:33,151
l don't want to leave.

52
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:37,362
You didn't want your father to die either, did you?

53
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:39,524
But it happened.

54
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,498
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

55
00:13:45,573 --> 00:13:48,940
- The Lord bless thee and keep thee... - lt was in Latin.

56
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:52,037
You don't speak Latin?

57
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:55,872
That's something we shall have to remedy.

58
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,381
The Lord

59
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:03,548
bless thee and keep thee.

60
00:14:04,091 --> 00:14:06,855
The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.

61
00:14:07,328 --> 00:14:10,456
The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee

62
00:14:10,898 --> 00:14:12,957
and give thee peace.

63
00:14:13,734 --> 00:14:15,793
Amen.

64
00:14:21,776 --> 00:14:23,869
Your heart is free.

65
00:14:25,179 --> 00:14:27,272
Have the courage to follow it.

66
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:56,935
What are they doing?

67
00:14:57,011 --> 00:14:59,104
Saying goodbye in their own way.

68
00:15:00,147 --> 00:15:03,583
Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

69
00:15:14,161 --> 00:15:18,325
lt was the same for me and your daddy when our father was killed.

70
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,785
First, learn to use...

71
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,757
this.

72
00:15:51,832 --> 00:15:53,891
Then l'll teach you... to use

73
00:15:55,436 --> 00:15:57,495
this.

74
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,659
Many years later,

75
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:32,033
Edward the Longshanks, King of England,

76
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:36,543
supervised the wedding of his eldest son, who would succeed him as king.

77
00:16:39,346 --> 00:16:41,041
Amen.

78
00:16:44,685 --> 00:16:46,812
As bride for his son,

79
00:16:46,887 --> 00:16:50,288
Longshanks had chosen the daughter of his rival,

80
00:16:50,357 --> 00:16:52,450
the King of France.

81
00:17:15,516 --> 00:17:19,111
lt was widely whispered that for the Princess to conceive,

82
00:17:19,186 --> 00:17:22,519
Longshanks would have to do the honors himself.

83
00:17:23,657 --> 00:17:27,115
That may have been what he had in mind all along.

84
00:17:31,065 --> 00:17:33,124
Scotland...

85
00:17:33,601 --> 00:17:35,694
My land.

86
00:17:36,904 --> 00:17:41,603
The French will grovel to anyone with strength.

87
00:17:41,709 --> 00:17:47,079
But how will they believe our strength when we cannot rule the whole of our island?

88
00:17:58,926 --> 00:18:02,089
- Where is my son? - Your pardon, my Lord.

89
00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:04,528
He asked me to come in his stead.

90
00:18:04,598 --> 00:18:07,032
l sent for him and he sends you?

91
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:09,895
Shall l leave, my Lord?

92
00:18:10,904 --> 00:18:14,305
lf he wants his queen to rule when l am gone,

93
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:18,573
then by all means stay and learn how. Please.

94
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:25,409
Nobles.

95
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:28,750
Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

96
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:32,553
Grant our nobles lands in the North.

97
00:18:32,626 --> 00:18:38,622
Give their nobles estates here in England. And make them too greedy to oppose us.

98
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:41,860
But, sir, our nobles will be reluctant to uproot.

99
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:46,429
New lands mean new taxes and they're already taxed for the war in France.

100
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,599
Are they?

101
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:51,669
Are they?

102
00:19:09,496 --> 00:19:11,691
The trouble with Scotland

103
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:13,699
is that it's full of Scots.

104
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:20,901
Perhaps the time has come

105
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:23,442
to reinstitute an old custom.

106
00:19:23,977 --> 00:19:26,878
Grant them primae noctis.

107
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:34,885
First night. When any common girl inhabiting their lands is married,

108
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:40,324
our nobles shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding.

109
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,223
lf we can't get them out,

110
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:48,461
we'll breed them out.

111
00:19:49,236 --> 00:19:53,400
That should fetch just the kind of lords we want to Scotland.

112
00:19:53,474 --> 00:19:55,533
Taxes or no taxes?

113
00:19:55,642 --> 00:19:57,667
A most excellent idea, sire.

114
00:19:57,745 --> 00:19:59,838
ls it?

115
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:08,920
Now, in Edinburgh were gathered the council of Scottish nobles.

116
00:20:09,022 --> 00:20:13,254
Among these was Robert, the 17th Earl of Bruce,

117
00:20:13,961 --> 00:20:17,362
a leading contender for the crown of Scotland.

118
00:20:23,103 --> 00:20:26,698
l hear that Longshanks has granted primae noctis.

119
00:20:26,774 --> 00:20:30,039
Clearly meant to draw more of his supporters here.

120
00:20:31,345 --> 00:20:35,145
My father believes we must lull Longshanks into our confidence

121
00:20:35,249 --> 00:20:38,275
by neither supporting his decree nor opposing it.

122
00:20:38,352 --> 00:20:42,288
- A wise plan. - How is your father? He missed the council.

123
00:20:42,356 --> 00:20:45,348
His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

124
00:20:50,197 --> 00:20:52,290
But he sends his greetings.

125
00:20:52,399 --> 00:20:55,459
And he says that l speak for all of the Bruces

126
00:20:55,536 --> 00:20:57,595
and for Scotland.

127
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:12,631
- You've dropped your rock. - A test of manhood.

128
00:23:14,908 --> 00:23:17,240
You win.

129
00:23:18,445 --> 00:23:20,504
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

130
00:23:20,881 --> 00:23:24,544
The English won't let us train with weapons, so we use stones.

131
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:28,451
The test of a soldier is not in his arm. lt's here.

132
00:23:28,522 --> 00:23:30,820
No. lt's here.

133
00:23:37,831 --> 00:23:39,890
Hamish?

134
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:55,073
Here you go, son. Show him how.

135
00:23:55,148 --> 00:23:57,480
- Come on, Hamish. - Come on, boy.

136
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:02,087
Come on.

137
00:24:14,267 --> 00:24:16,326
That's a good throw.

138
00:24:16,403 --> 00:24:18,462
Aye. Aye, it was.

139
00:24:19,339 --> 00:24:22,672
l was wondering if you could do that when it matters.

140
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:27,004
As it... as it matters in battle.

141
00:24:29,549 --> 00:24:31,881
Could you crush a man with that throw?

142
00:24:31,952 --> 00:24:34,284
l could crush you... like a worm.

143
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:38,723
- You could? - Aye.

144
00:24:39,926 --> 00:24:42,986
Well, then, do it. Like to see him crush me like a worm?

145
00:24:47,334 --> 00:24:49,529
- Come and do it. - You'll move.

146
00:24:49,603 --> 00:24:52,697
- l will not. - Right.

147
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:54,297
He'll move.

148
00:24:54,374 --> 00:24:56,308
Come on, Hamish.

149
00:24:57,711 --> 00:24:59,770
Come on there, boy.

150
00:25:07,788 --> 00:25:08,914
Well done.

151
00:25:23,637 --> 00:25:26,231
- A fine display. - Are you all right?

152
00:25:27,174 --> 00:25:31,270
- You look a wee bit shaky. - l should have remembered the rocks.

153
00:25:31,378 --> 00:25:32,402
Aye.

154
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:40,243
Get up, you big heap of...

155
00:25:41,188 --> 00:25:44,214
- lt's good to see ye again. - Aye, welcome home.

156
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:50,351
- Look what you did to my head. - You should have moved.

157
00:26:00,373 --> 00:26:02,967
William, will you dance with me?

158
00:26:03,977 --> 00:26:06,036
Of course l will.

159
00:26:30,837 --> 00:26:33,931
l've come to claim the right of primae noctis.

160
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:40,036
As lord of these lands, l will bless this marriage by taking the bride into my bed

161
00:26:40,447 --> 00:26:43,007
on the first night of her union.

162
00:26:43,083 --> 00:26:44,516
By God you will not!

163
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:50,848
lt is my noble right.

164
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:55,607
- Good evening, sir. - Ah, young Wallace.

165
00:28:56,683 --> 00:28:59,811
- A grand soft evening. - Aye, it's that.

166
00:28:59,886 --> 00:29:02,150
Might l have a word with your daughter?

167
00:29:04,591 --> 00:29:06,889
What do you want to have a word about?

168
00:29:06,993 --> 00:29:08,153
Well...

169
00:29:08,228 --> 00:29:11,823
Murron, would you like to ride with me on this fine evening?

170
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:17,061
ln this? You're out of your mind.

171
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:21,470
lt's good Scottish weather, madam. The rain is falling almost straight down.

172
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:24,168
- She cannae go with you. - No?

173
00:29:24,244 --> 00:29:26,712
No. No the now, anyway.

174
00:29:26,813 --> 00:29:28,508
- No the now. - No the now.

175
00:29:28,615 --> 00:29:32,415
- We'll see ye later. - The weather's fine. lt's hardly raining.

176
00:29:32,485 --> 00:29:34,578
Did you no hear what l said?

177
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:37,114
Murron.

178
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,718
lt's you she takes after.

179
00:30:11,925 --> 00:30:14,826
- How did you know me after so long? - l didn't.

180
00:30:15,862 --> 00:30:19,025
l saw you staring at me and l didn't know who you were.

181
00:30:19,099 --> 00:30:21,158
l'm sorry. l suppose l was.

182
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:26,871
Are you in the habit of riding off with strangers?

183
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,374
lt was the best way to make you leave.

184
00:30:32,178 --> 00:30:36,581
lf l ever find the courage to ask ye again, l'll warn you in writing first.

185
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:39,345
- lt wouldn't help. l can't read. - Can ye not?

186
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:41,579
No.

187
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:47,590
- That's something we shall have to remedy. - You'll teach me to read?

188
00:30:47,694 --> 00:30:49,753
- Aye, if you like. - Aye.

189
00:30:50,964 --> 00:30:54,957
- ln what language? - You're showing off now.

190
00:30:55,101 --> 00:30:58,264
- That's right. Are you impressed yet? - No. Should l be?

191
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,416
Do that standing on your head, and l'll be impressed.

192
00:31:10,683 --> 00:31:14,744
- My kilt'll fly up, but l'll try. - You learnt no manners on your travels.

193
00:31:14,821 --> 00:31:17,813
The French and the Romans are far worse than l.

194
00:31:17,924 --> 00:31:21,018
- You went to Rome? - Uncle took me on a pilgrimage.

195
00:31:21,127 --> 00:31:23,186
What was it like?

196
00:31:27,901 --> 00:31:29,960
What does that mean?

197
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:32,296
Beautiful.

198
00:31:34,841 --> 00:31:36,934
But l belong here.

199
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:11,635
Murron. Come in now.

200
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:27,509
Sir, l know it was strange of me to invite Murron to ride last night, but...

201
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:30,054
MacClannough's daughter is another matter.

202
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:34,560
- l've come to fetch you to a meeting. - What kind of meeting?

203
00:33:34,661 --> 00:33:38,028
- The secret kind. - Your meetings are a waste of time.

204
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,959
Your father was a fighter

205
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:45,695
and a patriot.

206
00:33:47,106 --> 00:33:49,165
l know who my father was.

207
00:33:50,276 --> 00:33:53,541
l came home to raise crops and, God willing, a family.

208
00:33:55,882 --> 00:33:58,646
- lf l can live in peace, l will. - Go on.

209
00:33:58,718 --> 00:34:01,482
- You want to stay out of the troubles? - Aye.

210
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:04,717
lf you can prove it, you may court my daughter.

211
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:06,884
Until you prove it, the answer is no.

212
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,656
- No. - No, Wallace. No.

213
00:34:10,597 --> 00:34:12,895
- Didn't l just prove it? - No.

214
00:34:12,966 --> 00:34:15,059
- No? - No!

215
00:34:56,843 --> 00:34:59,812
Of course, running a farm is a lot of work.

216
00:34:59,912 --> 00:35:03,177
But that will all change when my sons arrive.

217
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:06,176
So, you've got children.

218
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:10,313
Well, not yet. But l was hoping that you could help me with that.

219
00:35:10,657 --> 00:35:11,954
So you want me to marry you, then?

220
00:35:12,025 --> 00:35:14,585
Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

221
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:16,629
ls that what you call a proposal?

222
00:35:18,431 --> 00:35:21,229
l love you. Always have.

223
00:35:23,236 --> 00:35:25,329
l want to marry you.

224
00:35:37,016 --> 00:35:39,007
ls that a yes?

225
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:41,178
- Aye, that's a yes. - Yeah?

226
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:27,124
- We'd best hurry. He'll be waiting. - Oh, wait.

227
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,292
Where are you going?

228
00:36:34,874 --> 00:36:36,933
- What's that? - You'll see.

229
00:36:56,129 --> 00:36:58,222
Father.

230
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:12,436
l will love you my whole life.

231
00:37:13,913 --> 00:37:15,972
You and no other.

232
00:37:20,753 --> 00:37:22,983
And l you.

233
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:25,148
You and no other... for ever.

234
00:40:53,699 --> 00:40:56,259
When will l see ye again? Tonight?

235
00:40:56,335 --> 00:40:58,565
- l can't. - Why not?

236
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:00,400
My dad's growing suspicious.

237
00:41:00,506 --> 00:41:03,304
Would that have anything to do with...

238
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:05,469
When?

239
00:41:06,879 --> 00:41:08,403
When?

240
00:41:08,514 --> 00:41:10,573
- Tonight. - Tonight?

241
00:41:17,923 --> 00:41:19,982
Look lively, Sergeant.

242
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,429
What are you carrying, lassie?

243
00:41:33,539 --> 00:41:36,702
- That looks heavy. Can we help you? - That's fine.

244
00:41:36,809 --> 00:41:38,902
l'm not going to steal it...

245
00:41:39,912 --> 00:41:43,143
Oh. You remind me of my daughter back home.

246
00:41:57,263 --> 00:41:58,730
Hello, lassie.

247
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,417
Keep quiet, Smythe.

248
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:25,286
You bitch.

249
00:42:32,998 --> 00:42:34,226
You bitch.

250
00:42:42,575 --> 00:42:44,634
Are you all right?

251
00:42:48,581 --> 00:42:50,640
- Are you all right? - Aye.

252
00:43:00,693 --> 00:43:02,786
- Can you ride? - Aye.

253
00:43:06,999 --> 00:43:09,729
Come back here, you bastard!

254
00:43:10,503 --> 00:43:13,267
Ring the alarm. Help!

255
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:16,604
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

256
00:43:16,675 --> 00:43:18,643
They're getting away.

257
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:03,647
All right, you bitch.

258
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:28,604
Murron.

259
00:44:45,397 --> 00:44:50,334
All of you know full well the great pains l've always taken

260
00:44:51,403 --> 00:44:55,499
never to be too strict, too rigid, with the application of our laws.

261
00:44:56,642 --> 00:44:58,735
And, as a consequence,

262
00:44:58,811 --> 00:45:01,974
have we not learned to live together

263
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:04,607
in relative peace and harmony?

264
00:45:04,717 --> 00:45:06,582
Huh?

265
00:45:10,189 --> 00:45:16,150
And this... day's lawlessness is how you repay my leniency.

266
00:45:25,271 --> 00:45:27,364
You leave me with little choice.

267
00:45:35,614 --> 00:45:37,775
An assault on the King's soldiers

268
00:45:39,018 --> 00:45:42,181
is the same as an assault on the King himself.

269
00:45:58,804 --> 00:46:00,635
Now,

270
00:46:00,706 --> 00:46:03,573
let this scrapper come to me.

271
00:46:59,331 --> 00:47:01,026
There.

272
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:30,032
Corporal. Some archers on the tower. Now!

273
00:50:40,552 --> 00:50:42,850
Hold still, Father.

274
00:50:42,921 --> 00:50:45,253
You idiot, boy.

275
00:52:09,174 --> 00:52:11,768
- Father, are you all right? - Aye.

276
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:36,287
MacCaulich.

277
00:53:51,476 --> 00:53:54,070
Wallace.

278
00:56:16,655 --> 00:56:18,714
What are you waiting for, boy?

279
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:22,520
Here. You can do it. l'll hold him down.

280
00:56:24,429 --> 00:56:27,990
Here. You can do it. l'll hold him down.

281
00:56:28,066 --> 00:56:30,125
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

282
00:56:30,235 --> 00:56:33,136
l know it seems like a waste of good whisky. lndulge me.

283
00:56:37,108 --> 00:56:40,942
Hold him. Hold him. Hold him. Now,

284
00:56:41,046 --> 00:56:42,638
let him go.

285
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:48,677
All right?

286
00:56:48,753 --> 00:56:51,517
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

287
00:56:51,623 --> 00:56:54,217
- There's somebody coming. - Arm yourselves.

288
00:57:00,932 --> 00:57:03,025
There's somebody coming.

289
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:07,127
MacGregors. From the next glen.

290
00:57:12,243 --> 00:57:14,507
We heard about what was happening.

291
00:57:14,579 --> 00:57:19,039
We don't want you amerdans thinking you can have your fun without us.

292
00:57:20,652 --> 00:57:22,586
Go home.

293
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,746
Some of us are in this.

294
00:57:25,857 --> 00:57:29,691
l can't help that now. But you can help yourselves.

295
00:57:29,761 --> 00:57:31,456
Go home.

296
00:57:31,529 --> 00:57:35,590
We'll have no homes left when the English garrison burns us out.

297
00:57:36,801 --> 00:57:40,601
- And they will. - Aye.

298
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,532
Welcome.

299
00:58:13,004 --> 00:58:15,097
Patrol returning, my Lord.

300
00:58:42,934 --> 00:58:44,629
So, what news?

301
00:58:56,247 --> 00:59:00,616
l have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark. They will be returning now.

302
00:59:00,685 --> 00:59:02,846
Were they dressed like this?

303
00:59:04,622 --> 00:59:06,817
Actually, it was more like 50.

304
00:59:07,392 --> 00:59:09,451
Make it quick.

305
00:59:11,763 --> 00:59:13,822
Do you remember me?

306
00:59:14,966 --> 00:59:20,962
- l never did her any harm. lt was my right. - l'm here to claim the right of a husband!

307
00:59:28,246 --> 00:59:30,305
l'm William Wallace.

308
00:59:31,983 --> 00:59:34,042
And the rest of you will be spared.

309
00:59:35,019 --> 00:59:37,579
Go back to England.

310
00:59:37,655 --> 00:59:42,649
And tell them there that Scotland's daughters and her sons are yours no more.

311
00:59:44,796 --> 00:59:46,855
Tell them Scotland is free.

312
00:59:52,804 --> 00:59:53,828
Burn it.

313
01:00:28,139 --> 01:00:32,235
The Scottish rebels have routed one of my garrisons

314
01:00:32,944 --> 01:00:35,276
and murdered the noble Lord.

315
01:00:35,346 --> 01:00:39,043
l heard. This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

316
01:00:39,117 --> 01:00:42,575
And how would you deal with this... brigand?

317
01:00:42,687 --> 01:00:46,783
Like any common thief. Have the local magistrate arrest and punish him.

318
01:00:50,862 --> 01:00:52,489
Leave us.

319
01:01:02,473 --> 01:01:07,706
Wallace has already killed the magistrate and taken control of the town.

320
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,138
Stand up.

321
01:01:10,215 --> 01:01:11,978
Stand up!

322
01:01:12,984 --> 01:01:15,077
ln the morning,

323
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:18,718
l depart for France to press our rights there.

324
01:01:18,790 --> 01:01:21,816
And l leave you here to quell this little rebellion.

325
01:01:21,926 --> 01:01:24,827
Understood? ls it?

326
01:01:27,699 --> 01:01:30,099
One day you will be a king.

327
01:01:31,936 --> 01:01:33,995
At least try to act like one.

328
01:01:38,343 --> 01:01:40,402
Get away from me.

329
01:01:40,845 --> 01:01:43,313
Convene my military council.

330
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:25,890
There.

331
01:02:28,237 --> 01:02:29,568
After them.

332
01:02:56,466 --> 01:03:00,061
No point resisting. You're outnumbered and trapped.

333
01:03:00,169 --> 01:03:03,536
Where are the rest of you? Where's Wallace?

334
01:03:15,785 --> 01:03:18,982
- Father. - Ah, come in. Come in.

335
01:03:20,056 --> 01:03:22,149
A rebellion has begun.

336
01:03:28,998 --> 01:03:33,162
- Under whom? - A commoner... named William Wallace.

337
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:46,278
You will embrace this rebellion.

338
01:03:46,382 --> 01:03:49,215
Support it from our lands in the North.

339
01:03:50,386 --> 01:03:53,719
l will gain English favor by condemning it

340
01:03:53,856 --> 01:03:57,292
and ordering it opposed from our lands in the South.

341
01:03:59,195 --> 01:04:01,891
Sit down. Stay awhile.

342
01:04:08,871 --> 01:04:10,930
This Wallace...

343
01:04:12,108 --> 01:04:16,306
He doesn't even have a knighthood. But he fights with passion.

344
01:04:16,412 --> 01:04:18,437
And he inspires!

345
01:04:18,514 --> 01:04:21,608
And you wish to charge off and fight as he did?

346
01:04:23,286 --> 01:04:26,312
- So would l. - Well, maybe it's time.

347
01:04:26,422 --> 01:04:29,687
lt is time... to survive.

348
01:04:29,759 --> 01:04:32,819
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

349
01:04:32,929 --> 01:04:38,765
The 16 before you passed you land and title because they didn't charge in.

350
01:04:40,836 --> 01:04:44,135
- Call a meeting of the nobles. - They do nothing but talk.

351
01:04:44,240 --> 01:04:49,177
Rightly so. They're as rich in English titles and lands as they are in Scottish, as we are.

352
01:04:49,278 --> 01:04:52,679
You admire this man... this William Wallace.

353
01:04:52,748 --> 01:04:55,376
Uncompromising men are easier to admire.

354
01:04:55,484 --> 01:04:57,918
He has courage. So does a dog.

355
01:04:57,987 --> 01:05:02,583
But it is exactly the ability to compromise that makes a man noble.

356
01:05:03,492 --> 01:05:05,551
And understand this:

357
01:05:05,661 --> 01:05:10,064
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless king ever to sit on the throne of England.

358
01:05:10,132 --> 01:05:12,396
And none of us

359
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:15,595
and nothing of Scotland will remain

360
01:05:15,705 --> 01:05:17,764
unless we are as ruthless.

361
01:05:19,175 --> 01:05:21,268
Give ear to our nobles.

362
01:05:22,478 --> 01:05:24,537
Knowing their minds

363
01:05:24,614 --> 01:05:26,707
is the key to the throne.

364
01:05:43,432 --> 01:05:45,764
Wait. Look.

365
01:05:46,702 --> 01:05:48,761
This is out and this is left.

366
01:05:49,372 --> 01:05:51,431
Carry on.

367
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:38,874
You know, eventually, Longshanks will send in his northern army.

368
01:07:38,948 --> 01:07:43,044
Heavy cavalry. Armored horse. Shake the very ground.

369
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:49,281
- He'll ride right over us. - Uncle Argyle used to talk about it.

370
01:07:49,658 --> 01:07:52,821
How no army had ever stood up to a charge of heavy horse.

371
01:07:52,895 --> 01:07:56,422
- So what do we do? - Hit. Run. Hide. The Highland way.

372
01:08:04,707 --> 01:08:06,834
Or make spears.

373
01:08:07,676 --> 01:08:10,770
Hundreds of 'em. Long spears. Twice as long as a man.

374
01:08:11,881 --> 01:08:13,576
- That long? - Aye.

375
01:08:15,084 --> 01:08:17,143
Some men are longer than others.

376
01:08:17,253 --> 01:08:20,484
Your mother been telling you stories about me again?

377
01:08:22,258 --> 01:08:23,919
Volunteers coming in.

378
01:08:27,596 --> 01:08:31,362
William Wallace. We've come to fight and to die for you.

379
01:08:31,467 --> 01:08:33,526
Stand up, man. l'm not the Pope.

380
01:08:34,336 --> 01:08:36,566
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

381
01:08:37,339 --> 01:08:40,308
- l brought you this... - We checked them for arms.

382
01:08:41,677 --> 01:08:43,770
l brought you this.

383
01:08:43,879 --> 01:08:46,211
- My wife made it for you. - Thank you.

384
01:08:51,153 --> 01:08:53,781
Him! That can't be William Wallace.

385
01:08:53,889 --> 01:08:55,948
l'm prettier than this man.

386
01:08:59,628 --> 01:09:01,892
All right, Father. l'll ask him.

387
01:09:05,601 --> 01:09:07,762
lf l risk my neck for you,

388
01:09:07,837 --> 01:09:09,930
will l get to kill Englishmen?

389
01:09:10,005 --> 01:09:13,497
ls your father a ghost or do you converse with the Almighty?

390
01:09:13,576 --> 01:09:16,773
To find his equal, an lrishman is forced to talk to God.

391
01:09:16,846 --> 01:09:18,336
Yes, Father.

392
01:09:18,414 --> 01:09:21,906
The Almighty says, ''Just answer the fucking question!''

393
01:09:21,984 --> 01:09:24,009
- Mind your tongue. - lnsane lrish!

394
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:32,355
Smart enough to get a dagger past your guards, old man.

395
01:09:32,428 --> 01:09:34,419
That's my friend, lrishman.

396
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:39,194
And the answer to your question is yes. Fight for me, you get to kill the English.

397
01:09:40,002 --> 01:09:41,469
Excellent.

398
01:09:42,171 --> 01:09:44,230
Stephen is my name.

399
01:09:44,340 --> 01:09:46,672
l'm the most wanted man on my island.

400
01:09:46,775 --> 01:09:49,243
Except l'm not on my island, of course.

401
01:09:49,345 --> 01:09:51,779
- More's the pity. - Your island?

402
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:54,873
- You mean lreland? - Yeah. lt's mine.

403
01:09:59,788 --> 01:10:01,847
You're a madman.

404
01:10:08,664 --> 01:10:10,689
l've come to the right place, then.

405
01:11:31,313 --> 01:11:34,714
Sure, didn't the Almighty send me to watch your back?

406
01:11:36,352 --> 01:11:38,445
l didn't like him anyway.

407
01:11:40,689 --> 01:11:42,782
He wasn't right in the head.

408
01:11:55,971 --> 01:11:58,804
William. lt's our runners.

409
01:12:10,019 --> 01:12:13,750
The English... are advancing an army towards Stirling.

410
01:12:13,822 --> 01:12:18,191
- Do the nobles rally? - Robert the Bruce and others will not fight.

411
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:21,820
But word has spread. The Highlanders are coming down on their own.

412
01:12:21,930 --> 01:12:25,195
Aye... ln droves of hundreds... and thousands!

413
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:27,393
Are you ready for a war?

414
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:46,444
- What news? - We're outnumbered, at least three to one.

415
01:12:46,555 --> 01:12:48,853
- How many horse, then? - 300, maybe more.

416
01:12:48,957 --> 01:12:51,926
- 300 heavy horse! - We must try to negotiate.

417
01:12:51,994 --> 01:12:55,760
Who was in command? Did he have a scarlet chevron?

418
01:12:55,831 --> 01:12:58,356
- Aye, he did. - That'll be Cheltham.

419
01:12:58,434 --> 01:13:00,527
We could still negotiate...

420
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,633
What are they talking about?

421
01:13:06,742 --> 01:13:09,404
l cannae hear, but it doesnae look good.

422
01:13:09,478 --> 01:13:11,571
The nobles will negotiate.

423
01:13:11,647 --> 01:13:14,844
They do a deal... and we go home.

424
01:13:14,950 --> 01:13:17,544
lf not... we charge.

425
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:20,383
300 heavy horse. We've no chance.

426
01:14:19,681 --> 01:14:20,705
So many.

427
01:14:25,621 --> 01:14:28,920
l didn't come here to fight so they could own more lands.

428
01:14:29,024 --> 01:14:31,083
Then l'd have to work for them.

429
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,287
Nor me.

430
01:14:34,129 --> 01:14:37,428
All right, lads. l'm not dying for these bastards.

431
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,495
Let's go home.

432
01:14:57,352 --> 01:14:59,650
Stop, men!

433
01:14:59,721 --> 01:15:03,748
Do not flee. Wait until we've negotiated.

434
01:15:57,012 --> 01:16:00,311
- William Wallace! - Can't be. Not tall enough.

435
01:16:21,236 --> 01:16:25,832
The Almighty says this is a fashionable fight. lt's drawn the finest people.

436
01:16:25,941 --> 01:16:31,379
- Where is thy salute? - For coming to this battlefield, l thank you.

437
01:16:31,446 --> 01:16:34,540
This is our army. To join it, you give homage.

438
01:16:34,616 --> 01:16:37,016
l give homage to Scotland.

439
01:16:37,085 --> 01:16:39,417
And if this is your army,

440
01:16:40,789 --> 01:16:42,381
why does it go?

441
01:16:42,457 --> 01:16:44,755
We didn't come here to fight for them.

442
01:16:48,797 --> 01:16:51,231
Home. The English are too many.

443
01:17:00,475 --> 01:17:04,844
Sons of Scotland! l am William Wallace!

444
01:17:04,913 --> 01:17:08,610
- William Wallace is seven feet tall. - Yes, l've heard.

445
01:17:09,284 --> 01:17:11,411
He kills men by the hundred.

446
01:17:11,486 --> 01:17:15,820
And if he were here, he'd consume the English with fireballs from his eyes

447
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:17,984
and lightning from his arse.

448
01:17:22,064 --> 01:17:24,123
l am William Wallace!

449
01:17:25,734 --> 01:17:30,137
And l see a whole army of my countrymen

450
01:17:30,238 --> 01:17:32,536
here in defiance of tyranny.

451
01:17:35,877 --> 01:17:38,471
You've come to fight as free men

452
01:17:40,615 --> 01:17:42,674
and free men you are!

453
01:17:45,554 --> 01:17:48,045
What will you do without freedom?

454
01:17:50,158 --> 01:17:52,251
Will you fight?

455
01:17:55,697 --> 01:17:57,722
Against that? No.

456
01:17:57,833 --> 01:17:59,926
We will run, and we will live.

457
01:18:00,969 --> 01:18:03,529
Aye. Fight and you may die.

458
01:18:04,473 --> 01:18:06,532
Run, and you'll live.

459
01:18:07,542 --> 01:18:10,272
At least a while.

460
01:18:12,481 --> 01:18:15,712
And dying in your beds, many years from now,

461
01:18:17,052 --> 01:18:19,350
would you be willing to trade

462
01:18:19,488 --> 01:18:22,321
all the days from this day to that

463
01:18:22,391 --> 01:18:25,087
for one chance, just one chance,

464
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,993
to come back here and tell our enemies

465
01:18:28,096 --> 01:18:30,360
that they may take our lives

466
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:34,665
but they'll never take our freedom!

467
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:04,927
They seem quite optimistic. Maybe they do want to fight.

468
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,935
Confrontation might be a foregone conclusion.

469
01:19:09,237 --> 01:19:12,172
Nonetheless, we should deliver the King's terms.

470
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:15,368
The King's terms? They'll never live up to them.

471
01:19:15,510 --> 01:19:17,307
My Lord, l think...

472
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:19,540
All right. Offer them the terms.

473
01:19:23,018 --> 01:19:27,045
- They're coming out. Should we go to them? - Let me do the talking. Agreed?

474
01:19:27,155 --> 01:19:28,383
Aye.

475
01:19:33,261 --> 01:19:35,354
Fine speech.

476
01:19:36,164 --> 01:19:38,223
Now what do we do?

477
01:19:39,434 --> 01:19:41,561
Just be yourselves.

478
01:19:42,070 --> 01:19:45,801
- Where are you going? - l'm going to pick a fight.

479
01:19:52,080 --> 01:19:55,413
Well, we didn't get dressed up for nothing.

480
01:19:58,153 --> 01:20:00,178
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

481
01:20:05,193 --> 01:20:07,252
Here are the King's terms.

482
01:20:07,362 --> 01:20:10,854
Lead this army off the field

483
01:20:14,903 --> 01:20:17,770
and he will give you each estates in Yorkshire

484
01:20:18,907 --> 01:20:22,866
including hereditary title, from which you will pay...

485
01:20:24,246 --> 01:20:27,044
- From which you will pay... - l have an offer for ye.

486
01:20:27,115 --> 01:20:30,107
Cheltham, this is William Wallace.

487
01:20:31,853 --> 01:20:33,912
From which you will pay the King...

488
01:20:34,022 --> 01:20:37,287
- l said l have an offer. - You disrespect a banner of truce.

489
01:20:37,392 --> 01:20:39,292
From his King? Absolutely.

490
01:20:40,729 --> 01:20:46,395
Here are Scotland's terms. Lower your flags and march straight back to England.

491
01:20:46,468 --> 01:20:51,735
At every home you pass, beg forgiveness for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

492
01:20:52,841 --> 01:20:55,071
Do that, and your men shall live.

493
01:20:56,044 --> 01:20:59,070
Do it not and every one of you will die today.

494
01:21:05,954 --> 01:21:09,685
You are outmatched. You have no heavy cavalry.

495
01:21:09,758 --> 01:21:12,556
ln two centuries, no army has won without....

496
01:21:12,661 --> 01:21:14,652
l'm not finished!

497
01:21:16,264 --> 01:21:18,323
Before we let you leave

498
01:21:18,967 --> 01:21:23,461
your commander must cross that field, present himself before this army,

499
01:21:23,838 --> 01:21:27,035
put his head between his legs and kiss his own arse.

500
01:21:38,520 --> 01:21:40,954
That was less cordial than he was used to.

501
01:21:41,056 --> 01:21:44,355
You be ready and do exactly as l say. On my signal

502
01:21:44,459 --> 01:21:47,519
ride round behind our position, and flank them.

503
01:21:47,662 --> 01:21:52,099
- We must not divide our forces. - Do it... and let the English see you do it.

504
01:21:53,335 --> 01:21:55,394
They'll think we run away?

505
01:21:55,503 --> 01:21:58,131
Take out their archers and meet in the middle.

506
01:21:58,707 --> 01:22:00,766
Right. Come on.

507
01:22:24,699 --> 01:22:28,430
lnsolent bastard. l want this Wallace's heart on a plate!

508
01:22:29,371 --> 01:22:30,895
Archers.

509
01:22:39,347 --> 01:22:42,544
Archers forward.

510
01:23:39,207 --> 01:23:40,504
You bastards.

511
01:24:15,643 --> 01:24:16,871
Loose.

512
01:24:36,898 --> 01:24:41,358
The Lord tells me He can get me out of this mess but He's pretty sure you're fucked.

513
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:04,458
Ready... Loose.

514
01:25:22,610 --> 01:25:24,134
Ride.

515
01:25:28,183 --> 01:25:30,879
See? Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

516
01:25:30,952 --> 01:25:35,286
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass. Send the horse.

517
01:25:36,124 --> 01:25:37,785
Full attack.

518
01:26:52,367 --> 01:26:54,062
Steady...

519
01:26:55,303 --> 01:26:56,634
Hold.

520
01:26:58,706 --> 01:27:00,264
Hold.

521
01:27:05,046 --> 01:27:06,104
Hold.

522
01:27:10,685 --> 01:27:12,482
Hold.

523
01:27:24,232 --> 01:27:26,496
Now!

524
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:14,478
- Send the infantry. - My Lord...

525
01:28:14,549 --> 01:28:15,777
You lead them.

526
01:28:29,464 --> 01:28:32,365
Charge.

527
01:30:35,590 --> 01:30:36,716
Retreat.

528
01:31:11,726 --> 01:31:13,455
Bastard.

529
01:31:14,495 --> 01:31:16,690
Come on.

530
01:31:57,104 --> 01:31:58,731
All right.

531
01:32:27,435 --> 01:32:29,630
Wallace.

532
01:32:35,843 --> 01:32:38,175
Wallace.

533
01:33:10,611 --> 01:33:12,670
l knight thee

534
01:33:12,780 --> 01:33:14,839
Sir William Wallace.

535
01:33:18,986 --> 01:33:21,079
Sir William, in the name of God

536
01:33:21,188 --> 01:33:24,555
we appoint thee guardian and high protector of Scotland

537
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:27,389
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

538
01:33:28,195 --> 01:33:30,254
Stand and be recognized.

539
01:33:42,310 --> 01:33:44,210
Does anyone know his politics?

540
01:33:44,278 --> 01:33:48,078
No, but his weight with the commoners could upset everything.

541
01:33:48,182 --> 01:33:50,980
The Balliols will kiss his arse, and so we must.

542
01:33:58,893 --> 01:34:00,884
Sir William.

543
01:34:07,234 --> 01:34:10,692
lnasmuch as you and your captains hail from a region

544
01:34:10,805 --> 01:34:13,865
long known to support the Balliol clan,

545
01:34:13,941 --> 01:34:19,038
may we invite you to continue your support and uphold our rightful claim?

546
01:34:19,680 --> 01:34:23,116
Damn the Balliol clan. They're all Longshanks's men.

547
01:34:24,618 --> 01:34:26,643
Gentlemen.

548
01:34:27,722 --> 01:34:30,020
- Gentlemen. - lt's time to declare a king.

549
01:34:30,124 --> 01:34:34,322
Halt. Wait. Are you prepared to recognize our legitimate succession?

550
01:34:34,428 --> 01:34:38,159
- You won't support the claim. - Those were lies, written by you.

551
01:34:38,265 --> 01:34:40,460
Oh, no.

552
01:34:40,534 --> 01:34:46,131
- l demand recognition of these documents. - These were lies when you wrote them.

553
01:34:47,141 --> 01:34:48,972
Please, gentlemen.

554
01:34:51,312 --> 01:34:53,940
Quiet. Sir William. Where are you going?

555
01:34:56,350 --> 01:34:58,181
We have beaten the English.

556
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:02,382
But they'll come back because you won't stand together.

557
01:35:03,791 --> 01:35:06,783
- What will you do? - l will invade England

558
01:35:06,894 --> 01:35:09,954
and defeat the English on their own ground.

559
01:35:12,166 --> 01:35:14,259
lnvade? That's impossible.

560
01:35:14,335 --> 01:35:16,963
Why? Why is that impossible?

561
01:35:17,972 --> 01:35:22,739
You're so concerned with squabbling for the scraps from Longshanks's table

562
01:35:22,810 --> 01:35:26,803
that you've missed your God-given right to something better.

563
01:35:26,914 --> 01:35:28,973
There's a difference between us.

564
01:35:29,617 --> 01:35:33,917
You think the people of Scotland exist to provide you with position.

565
01:35:33,988 --> 01:35:38,391
l think your position exists to provide those people with freedom.

566
01:35:39,427 --> 01:35:41,793
And l go to make sure that they have it.

567
01:35:55,009 --> 01:35:57,102
Wait.

568
01:36:00,181 --> 01:36:04,811
l respect what you said. But remember that these men have lands and castles.

569
01:36:04,919 --> 01:36:06,819
lt's much to risk.

570
01:36:06,921 --> 01:36:10,652
And the common man that bleeds in battle, does he risk less?

571
01:36:15,729 --> 01:36:20,632
No. But from top to bottom, this country has got no sense of itself.

572
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:23,931
lts nobles share allegiance with England.

573
01:36:24,004 --> 01:36:26,336
- lts clans war with each other. - Aye.

574
01:36:28,609 --> 01:36:32,477
lf you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.

575
01:36:32,580 --> 01:36:37,483
- We all will. lt's a question of how and why. - l'm not a coward. l want what you want.

576
01:36:37,585 --> 01:36:39,382
But we need the nobles.

577
01:36:39,453 --> 01:36:41,853
- We need 'em? - Aye.

578
01:36:43,624 --> 01:36:45,683
What does that mean, to be noble?

579
01:36:45,793 --> 01:36:50,821
Your title gives you claim to Scotland's throne, but men don't follow titles.

580
01:36:51,765 --> 01:36:53,824
They follow courage.

581
01:36:53,901 --> 01:36:57,166
Our people know you. Noble and common, they respect you.

582
01:36:57,271 --> 01:37:00,900
And if you would just lead them to freedom...

583
01:37:03,444 --> 01:37:05,503
they'd follow you.

584
01:37:07,114 --> 01:37:09,241
And so would l.

585
01:37:30,304 --> 01:37:35,139
Damn it. My sodomite cousin the Prince tells me he has no troops to lend.

586
01:37:35,276 --> 01:37:38,404
Every town in northern England is begging for help.

587
01:37:39,346 --> 01:37:41,007
He advances.

588
01:37:41,081 --> 01:37:43,276
- To which town? - To here, my Lord.

589
01:37:44,518 --> 01:37:49,046
Bring the provisions inside, double the guards, seal the gate. Now.

590
01:37:49,123 --> 01:37:51,421
Quickly. Bring in the provisions.

591
01:38:21,755 --> 01:38:24,451
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

592
01:38:24,525 --> 01:38:27,983
l will not tell my uncle l've lost him the greatest city in the North.

593
01:39:09,336 --> 01:39:10,803
Come on.

594
01:39:45,472 --> 01:39:47,565
Make way for the King.

595
01:39:56,684 --> 01:39:58,777
lt's not your fault.

596
01:39:59,653 --> 01:40:02,781
- Stand up to him. - l will stand up to him and more.

597
01:40:41,028 --> 01:40:43,428
What news of the North?

598
01:40:44,398 --> 01:40:48,198
Nothing new, Your Majesty. We've sent riders to speed any word.

599
01:40:49,103 --> 01:40:53,733
l heard the word in France where l was fighting to expand your future kingdom.

600
01:40:54,742 --> 01:40:59,873
The word, my son, is that our entire northern army is annihilated.

601
01:41:01,615 --> 01:41:03,913
And you have done nothing.

602
01:41:04,017 --> 01:41:08,078
l... have ordered conscription, sir, assembled and ready to depart.

603
01:41:10,657 --> 01:41:14,525
Excuse me, sire, but there's a very urgent message from York.

604
01:41:14,628 --> 01:41:16,687
Come.

605
01:41:24,338 --> 01:41:26,465
- Leave us. - Thank you, sire.

606
01:41:29,843 --> 01:41:32,676
- Wallace has sacked York. - What?

607
01:41:32,746 --> 01:41:34,839
Wallace has sacked York.

608
01:41:50,097 --> 01:41:53,157
Sire... thy own nephew.

609
01:41:54,334 --> 01:41:57,326
What beast could do such a thing.

610
01:41:58,539 --> 01:42:00,598
lf he can sack York

611
01:42:03,310 --> 01:42:05,471
he can invade Lower England.

612
01:42:05,546 --> 01:42:07,275
We will stop him.

613
01:42:09,683 --> 01:42:13,813
Who is this person who speaks to me as though l needed his advice?

614
01:42:16,023 --> 01:42:19,789
- l have declared Phillip my High Counsellor. - ls he qualified?

615
01:42:20,828 --> 01:42:24,161
l am skilled in the arts of war and military tactics, sire.

616
01:42:25,499 --> 01:42:27,558
Are you?

617
01:42:28,135 --> 01:42:29,159
Tell me...

618
01:42:29,236 --> 01:42:34,538
What advice would you offer on the present... situation?

619
01:43:05,672 --> 01:43:07,765
l shall offer a truce

620
01:43:09,343 --> 01:43:11,402
and buy him off.

621
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,841
But who will go to him? Not l.

622
01:43:17,584 --> 01:43:20,280
lf l fell under the sword of that murderer

623
01:43:20,387 --> 01:43:23,481
it might be my head in a basket.

624
01:43:24,558 --> 01:43:27,959
And not... my gentle son.

625
01:43:28,028 --> 01:43:32,829
The mere sight of him would only encourage an enemy to take over the whole country.

626
01:43:36,203 --> 01:43:38,262
So whom do l send?

627
01:43:43,110 --> 01:43:44,099
Whom do l send?

628
01:45:07,819 --> 01:45:09,912
l'm dreaming.

629
01:45:09,988 --> 01:45:12,081
Yes, you are.

630
01:45:13,291 --> 01:45:15,350
And you must wake.

631
01:45:23,902 --> 01:45:25,961
l don't want to wake.

632
01:45:27,138 --> 01:45:29,197
l want to stay here with you.

633
01:45:30,775 --> 01:45:32,834
And l with you.

634
01:45:33,611 --> 01:45:35,704
But you must wake now.

635
01:45:38,783 --> 01:45:40,842
Wake up, William.

636
01:45:41,152 --> 01:45:43,211
Wake up.

637
01:45:44,422 --> 01:45:46,652
William, wake up...

638
01:45:47,192 --> 01:45:50,252
William. A royal entourage comes

639
01:45:50,361 --> 01:45:52,420
flying banners of truce

640
01:45:52,530 --> 01:45:55,192
and the standards of Longshanks himself.

641
01:46:38,309 --> 01:46:40,402
l am the Princess of Wales.

642
01:46:40,478 --> 01:46:44,005
l come as the King's servant and with his authority.

643
01:46:45,183 --> 01:46:47,242
To do what?

644
01:46:47,652 --> 01:46:49,813
To discuss the King's proposals.

645
01:46:51,656 --> 01:46:53,715
Will you speak with a woman?

646
01:47:14,479 --> 01:47:17,209
l hear you have been given the rank of knight.

647
01:47:17,282 --> 01:47:19,341
l have been given nothing.

648
01:47:20,218 --> 01:47:22,277
God makes men what they are.

649
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:25,322
God made you the sacker of peaceful cities?

650
01:47:25,423 --> 01:47:30,053
The executioner of the King's nephew, my husband's own cousin?

651
01:47:30,528 --> 01:47:34,362
York was the staging point for every invasion of my country.

652
01:47:35,533 --> 01:47:40,698
That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even women and children, from the city walls.

653
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:47,269
Longshanks did far worse the last time he took a Scottish city.

654
01:48:03,494 --> 01:48:05,655
Or in French if you prefer?

655
01:48:07,598 --> 01:48:10,465
You ask your King... to his face. Ask him.

656
01:48:13,471 --> 01:48:16,167
See if his eyes can convince you of the truth.

657
01:48:24,782 --> 01:48:26,875
Hamilton... Leave us.

658
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:31,584
- My Lady? - Leave us. Now.

659
01:48:43,401 --> 01:48:45,335
Let us talk plainly.

660
01:48:45,403 --> 01:48:47,598
You invade England.

661
01:48:47,739 --> 01:48:52,233
But you cannot complete the conquest so far from your shelter and supply.

662
01:48:53,578 --> 01:48:55,637
The King desires peace.

663
01:48:56,447 --> 01:49:00,543
- Longshanks desires peace? - He declares it to me, l swear it.

664
01:49:00,618 --> 01:49:03,178
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

665
01:49:03,254 --> 01:49:06,815
ln return he grants you title, estates and this chest of gold

666
01:49:06,924 --> 01:49:08,949
which l am to pay to you personally.

667
01:49:10,361 --> 01:49:14,457
A lordship and titles, gold... that l should become Judas.

668
01:49:15,266 --> 01:49:18,565
- Peace is made in such ways. - Slaves are made in such ways.

669
01:49:21,873 --> 01:49:25,206
The last time Longshanks spoke of peace, l was a boy.

670
01:49:25,276 --> 01:49:28,074
Many Scottish nobles who would not be slaves,

671
01:49:28,179 --> 01:49:31,478
were lured by him, under a flag of truce, to a barn...

672
01:49:32,250 --> 01:49:34,343
where he had them hanged.

673
01:49:34,952 --> 01:49:40,015
l was very young, but l remember Longshanks's notion of peace.

674
01:49:44,095 --> 01:49:46,461
l understand you have suffered.

675
01:49:47,999 --> 01:49:50,900
l know... about your woman.

676
01:50:02,013 --> 01:50:04,072
She was my wife.

677
01:50:06,417 --> 01:50:11,650
We married in secret because l would not share her with an English lord.

678
01:50:12,089 --> 01:50:15,422
They killed her... to get to me.

679
01:50:20,331 --> 01:50:22,424
l've never spoken of it.

680
01:50:24,101 --> 01:50:26,899
l don't know why l tell you now, except...

681
01:50:30,241 --> 01:50:32,300
l see her strength in you.

682
01:50:38,249 --> 01:50:40,308
One day, you'll be a queen.

683
01:50:43,221 --> 01:50:45,280
And you must open your eyes.

684
01:50:52,296 --> 01:50:54,355
You tell your King

685
01:50:54,932 --> 01:50:59,835
that William Wallace will not be ruled and nor will any Scot while l live.

686
01:51:33,204 --> 01:51:38,540
Ah. My son's loyal wife returns unkilled by the heathen.

687
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:42,010
- So he accepted our bribe? - No. He did not.

688
01:51:43,614 --> 01:51:45,707
Then why does he stay?

689
01:51:45,783 --> 01:51:48,684
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

690
01:51:48,753 --> 01:51:50,880
He waits for you at York.

691
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:56,018
He says he will attack no more towns if you are man enough to come and face him.

692
01:51:56,627 --> 01:51:58,754
Did he?

693
01:51:58,896 --> 01:52:02,957
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

694
01:52:03,034 --> 01:52:07,562
arriving so far around his flank.

695
01:52:08,372 --> 01:52:11,341
The main force of our armies from France land here

696
01:52:11,409 --> 01:52:13,570
to the north of Edinburgh.

697
01:52:13,644 --> 01:52:17,978
Conscripts from lreland will approach from the southwest...

698
01:52:18,616 --> 01:52:19,640
to here.

699
01:52:19,750 --> 01:52:23,311
Welsh bowmen, troops from France, lrish conscripts.

700
01:52:23,387 --> 01:52:26,151
But they'd take weeks to assemble.

701
01:52:27,058 --> 01:52:30,585
l dispatched them... before l sent your wife.

702
01:52:35,366 --> 01:52:39,393
So our little ruse succeeded. Thank you.

703
01:52:39,470 --> 01:52:43,736
And while this upstart awaits my arrival in York,

704
01:52:43,808 --> 01:52:47,767
my forces will have arrived in Edinburgh, behind him.

705
01:52:48,980 --> 01:52:51,813
You spoke with this...

706
01:52:52,750 --> 01:52:55,548
Wallace in private?

707
01:52:56,420 --> 01:52:58,081
Tell me...

708
01:52:59,690 --> 01:53:01,783
What kind of man is he?

709
01:53:03,060 --> 01:53:05,153
A mindless barbarian.

710
01:53:05,896 --> 01:53:07,989
Not a king like you, my Lord.

711
01:53:10,468 --> 01:53:12,959
You may return to your embroidery.

712
01:53:13,604 --> 01:53:15,663
Humbly, my Lord.

713
01:53:15,773 --> 01:53:17,832
You brought back the money?

714
01:53:21,679 --> 01:53:26,446
No. l gave it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.

715
01:53:29,020 --> 01:53:31,386
That's what happens when you send a woman.

716
01:53:33,524 --> 01:53:35,287
Forgive me, sire.

717
01:53:35,393 --> 01:53:40,695
l thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.

718
01:53:44,301 --> 01:53:46,428
My greatness

719
01:53:46,504 --> 01:53:50,201
will be better demonstrated when Wallace returns to Scotland

720
01:53:50,274 --> 01:53:52,742
and finds his country in ashes.

721
01:53:58,149 --> 01:53:59,548
William.

722
01:53:59,650 --> 01:54:01,845
There's riders approaching.

723
01:54:08,726 --> 01:54:11,320
A personal escort of the Princess.

724
01:54:11,862 --> 01:54:13,955
Aye.

725
01:54:14,165 --> 01:54:16,360
Must have made an impression.

726
01:54:17,301 --> 01:54:20,361
- Aye. - l didn't think you were in the tent that long.

727
01:54:56,407 --> 01:54:59,570
lt's true. The English ships are coming from the South.

728
01:54:59,677 --> 01:55:02,976
l don't know about the Welsh yet, but the lrish have landed.

729
01:55:03,080 --> 01:55:08,211
- l had to see it myself to believe it. - Why are the lrish fighting with the English?

730
01:55:08,319 --> 01:55:11,777
l wouldn't worry about them. Didn't l tell you before?

731
01:55:12,523 --> 01:55:14,218
lt's my island.

732
01:55:14,325 --> 01:55:18,557
Hamish, ride ahead to Edinburgh and assemble the council. Order it.

733
01:55:18,629 --> 01:55:21,189
Right. Come on.

734
01:55:23,801 --> 01:55:27,396
- Your island? - My island. Yup.

735
01:55:28,539 --> 01:55:31,201
- We'll have to negotiate. - Please, gentlemen.

736
01:55:31,308 --> 01:55:33,640
Lords, Craig is right.

737
01:55:33,744 --> 01:55:39,546
This time our only option is to negotiate. Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...

738
01:55:47,391 --> 01:55:50,019
My army has marched for many days.

739
01:55:50,127 --> 01:55:54,587
And we still have preparations to make, so l'll make this plain.

740
01:55:56,066 --> 01:56:01,197
We require every soldier you can summon, your personal escorts, even yourselves.

741
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:04,332
And we need them now.

742
01:56:04,809 --> 01:56:08,575
With such a force arrayed against us, it's time to discuss other options.

743
01:56:08,646 --> 01:56:10,739
Other options?

744
01:56:11,582 --> 01:56:15,074
Don't you wish at least to lead your men onto the field

745
01:56:15,186 --> 01:56:17,984
and barter a better deal with Longshanks

746
01:56:18,088 --> 01:56:20,556
- before you run? - Sir William...

747
01:56:20,624 --> 01:56:22,489
- We cannot defeat them. - We can.

748
01:56:22,626 --> 01:56:24,992
- Sir William. - And we will.

749
01:56:27,364 --> 01:56:30,299
We won at Stirling, and still you quibble.

750
01:56:32,303 --> 01:56:35,067
We won at York and you would not support us.

751
01:56:35,172 --> 01:56:38,403
lf you'll no stand up with us now, l'd say you're cowards.

752
01:56:45,249 --> 01:56:46,807
lf you are Scotsmen,

753
01:56:46,884 --> 01:56:48,852
l'm ashamed to call myself one.

754
01:56:49,687 --> 01:56:52,417
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

755
01:56:54,525 --> 01:56:55,787
l beg you.

756
01:56:59,597 --> 01:57:02,896
You've achieved so much, but fighting these odds,

757
01:57:03,000 --> 01:57:05,833
it looks like rage, not courage.

758
01:57:05,903 --> 01:57:07,996
lt's well beyond rage.

759
01:57:10,207 --> 01:57:12,437
Help me.

760
01:57:12,509 --> 01:57:16,707
ln the name of Christ, help yourselves.

761
01:57:16,814 --> 01:57:18,873
Now is our chance. Now.

762
01:57:18,949 --> 01:57:21,110
lf we join, we can win. lf we win,

763
01:57:21,218 --> 01:57:24,016
we'll have what none of us have ever had before.

764
01:57:25,723 --> 01:57:27,816
A country of our own.

765
01:57:29,493 --> 01:57:33,930
You're the rightful leader and there is strength in you, l see it.

766
01:57:38,969 --> 01:57:41,267
Unite us.

767
01:57:44,041 --> 01:57:46,168
Unite us. Unite the clans.

768
01:57:53,350 --> 01:57:56,376
- All right. - Right.

769
01:58:01,692 --> 01:58:03,956
This cannot be the way.

770
01:58:04,061 --> 01:58:08,862
You said yourself the nobles will not support Wallace.

771
01:58:10,267 --> 01:58:14,499
So how does it help us to join the side that is slaughtered?

772
01:58:15,339 --> 01:58:17,398
l gave him my word.

773
01:58:25,616 --> 01:58:29,609
l know it is hard. Being a leader is.

774
01:58:31,322 --> 01:58:33,381
My son...

775
01:58:33,958 --> 01:58:35,289
Son...

776
01:58:35,960 --> 01:58:38,019
Look at me.

777
01:58:44,301 --> 01:58:46,633
l cannot be King.

778
01:58:46,737 --> 01:58:49,331
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

779
01:58:50,541 --> 01:58:52,372
What l tell you, you must do.

780
01:58:53,043 --> 01:58:55,170
Not for me, not for yourself,

781
01:58:55,913 --> 01:58:57,972
but for your country.

782
01:59:14,164 --> 01:59:16,428
Right, lads, make way. Coming through.

783
01:59:23,574 --> 01:59:25,633
Make way, lads.

784
01:59:30,814 --> 01:59:34,807
- The Bruce is not coming, William. - He'll come.

785
01:59:36,653 --> 01:59:39,178
Mornay and Lochlan have come.

786
01:59:40,624 --> 01:59:42,683
So will the Bruce.

787
01:59:45,095 --> 01:59:49,464
Quite a lovely... gathering.

788
01:59:50,567 --> 01:59:52,865
Wouldn't you agree?

789
01:59:55,906 --> 01:59:58,807
- The archers are ready, sire. - Not the archers.

790
01:59:58,876 --> 02:00:02,607
My scouts say their archers are miles away and no threat.

791
02:00:02,679 --> 02:00:07,446
Arrows cost money. Use up the lrish. The dead cost nothing.

792
02:00:07,518 --> 02:00:09,986
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

793
02:00:10,054 --> 02:00:12,113
lnfantry.

794
02:00:13,390 --> 02:00:15,381
Cavalry.

795
02:00:18,328 --> 02:00:20,319
Advance.

796
02:01:44,781 --> 02:01:48,911
Ah, good to see ye this morning.

797
02:01:51,555 --> 02:01:52,749
lrish!

798
02:01:53,490 --> 02:01:55,720
Glad to have ye with us. Watch this.

799
02:04:07,090 --> 02:04:09,149
Mornay? Lochlan?

800
02:04:09,259 --> 02:04:12,160
l gave Mornay double his lands in Scotland

801
02:04:12,262 --> 02:04:14,287
and matching estates in England.

802
02:04:14,431 --> 02:04:17,832
Lochlan turned... for much less.

803
02:04:18,769 --> 02:04:19,963
Archers.

804
02:04:20,070 --> 02:04:23,062
l beg your pardon, sire? Won't we hit our own troops?

805
02:04:25,542 --> 02:04:27,134
Yes.

806
02:04:27,244 --> 02:04:30,873
But we'll hit theirs as well. We have reserves.

807
02:04:32,549 --> 02:04:34,176
Attack.

808
02:04:34,951 --> 02:04:35,975
Archers.

809
02:05:13,957 --> 02:05:16,687
Send in our reinforcements.

810
02:05:16,760 --> 02:05:19,490
Send in the rest.

811
02:05:29,206 --> 02:05:32,801
Bring me Wallace. Alive, if possible.

812
02:05:32,909 --> 02:05:34,968
Dead... just as good.

813
02:05:36,246 --> 02:05:40,114
Send us news of our victory. Shall we retire?

814
02:07:05,101 --> 02:07:07,194
Protect the King.

815
02:09:10,627 --> 02:09:13,528
Get up.

816
02:09:15,465 --> 02:09:17,865
Get up.

817
02:09:18,835 --> 02:09:20,735
- Get him out of here. - Jesus.

818
02:09:25,408 --> 02:09:27,137
Go.

819
02:10:27,804 --> 02:10:29,863
l'm dying.

820
02:10:33,009 --> 02:10:35,068
Let me be.

821
02:10:40,283 --> 02:10:41,944
No.

822
02:10:42,652 --> 02:10:44,711
You're going to live.

823
02:10:46,423 --> 02:10:48,914
l've lived long enough to live free.

824
02:10:50,093 --> 02:10:51,924
Proud...

825
02:10:52,028 --> 02:10:54,553
to see you become the man you are.

826
02:10:59,436 --> 02:11:01,495
l'm a happy man.

827
02:12:51,147 --> 02:12:53,274
l'm the one who's rotting.

828
02:12:53,383 --> 02:12:57,251
But l think your face looks graver than mine.

829
02:13:02,192 --> 02:13:03,454
Son...

830
02:13:09,599 --> 02:13:13,501
We must have alliance with England to prevail here.

831
02:13:13,603 --> 02:13:15,662
You achieved that.

832
02:13:16,372 --> 02:13:20,035
You saved your family and increased your land.

833
02:13:20,109 --> 02:13:25,172
ln time, you will have all the power in Scotland.

834
02:13:25,248 --> 02:13:27,216
Lands.

835
02:13:27,283 --> 02:13:29,615
Titles. Men.

836
02:13:29,686 --> 02:13:31,415
Power. Nothing.

837
02:13:31,487 --> 02:13:34,422
- Nothing? - l have nothing.

838
02:13:35,792 --> 02:13:40,491
Men fight for me because if they do not l throw them off my land

839
02:13:40,597 --> 02:13:43,691
and l starve their wives and their children.

840
02:13:43,833 --> 02:13:45,892
Those men

841
02:13:46,002 --> 02:13:48,994
who bled the ground red at Falkirk...

842
02:13:50,607 --> 02:13:55,635
They fought for William Wallace, and he fights for something that l've never had.

843
02:13:58,414 --> 02:14:01,247
And l took it from him when l betrayed him

844
02:14:01,317 --> 02:14:04,218
and l saw it in his face on the battlefield.

845
02:14:04,287 --> 02:14:06,517
And it's tearing me apart.

846
02:14:07,223 --> 02:14:10,454
Well, all men betray. All lose heart.

847
02:14:10,526 --> 02:14:13,290
l don't want to lose heart.

848
02:14:17,133 --> 02:14:19,226
l want to believe...

849
02:14:19,569 --> 02:14:21,662
as he does.

850
02:14:27,710 --> 02:14:30,543
l will never be on the wrong side again.

851
02:15:20,396 --> 02:15:22,387
No.

852
02:16:19,289 --> 02:16:21,757
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

853
02:16:21,858 --> 02:16:26,852
Aye. Wallace rode into his bedchamber and killed him.

854
02:16:26,930 --> 02:16:29,865
More of a liability now than ever he was.

855
02:16:30,667 --> 02:16:33,261
And there's no telling who'll be next.

856
02:16:35,505 --> 02:16:37,564
Maybe you.

857
02:16:39,175 --> 02:16:41,268
Maybe me.

858
02:16:46,282 --> 02:16:48,341
lt doesn't matter.

859
02:16:49,986 --> 02:16:52,386
- l'm serious, Robert. - So am l.

860
02:17:05,601 --> 02:17:07,501
Christ. Shit.

861
02:17:08,538 --> 02:17:10,597
Search the place.

862
02:17:13,209 --> 02:17:15,541
Lochlan.

863
02:17:21,351 --> 02:17:23,615
William Wallace killed 50 men.

864
02:17:24,587 --> 02:17:26,646
50 if it was one.

865
02:17:26,756 --> 02:17:31,318
100 men... with his own sword. Cut through them like...

866
02:17:31,394 --> 02:17:34,659
Moses through the Red Sea.

867
02:18:07,263 --> 02:18:09,356
His legend grows.

868
02:18:09,432 --> 02:18:11,559
lt will be worse than before.

869
02:18:11,634 --> 02:18:17,163
He rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town. When he replenishes his numbers...

870
02:18:17,240 --> 02:18:19,674
They're sheep. Mere sheep.

871
02:18:22,211 --> 02:18:24,907
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

872
02:18:25,014 --> 02:18:26,675
Very well.

873
02:18:28,251 --> 02:18:32,517
Pick a flock of your finest assassins and set a meeting.

874
02:18:32,622 --> 02:18:36,524
My Lord, Wallace is renowned for his ability to smell an ambush.

875
02:18:40,463 --> 02:18:43,728
lf what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct

876
02:18:44,434 --> 02:18:48,131
he warmed to our future Queen and would trust her.

877
02:18:49,672 --> 02:18:53,335
So we'll dispatch her with the notion that she comes in peace.

878
02:18:53,443 --> 02:18:56,241
My Lord, the Princess might be taken hostage

879
02:18:56,312 --> 02:18:58,405
or her life be put in jeopardy.

880
02:18:58,481 --> 02:19:02,281
My son would be most distressed by that.

881
02:19:03,619 --> 02:19:06,019
But in truth if she were to be killed,

882
02:19:06,089 --> 02:19:12,289
we would soon find the King of France a useful ally against the Scots.

883
02:19:13,930 --> 02:19:16,023
You see...

884
02:19:16,099 --> 02:19:21,162
As King, you must find the good in any situation.

885
02:19:48,131 --> 02:19:50,258
lt's William Wallace, sure.

886
02:19:51,067 --> 02:19:55,094
And he's given up his sword. Be ready.

887
02:21:34,904 --> 02:21:37,031
My Lady.

888
02:21:39,809 --> 02:21:41,800
l received your message.

889
02:21:54,790 --> 02:21:59,124
This is... the second time you've warned me of danger.

890
02:22:01,430 --> 02:22:02,829
Why?

891
02:22:02,898 --> 02:22:06,834
There will be a new shipment of supplies coming north next month.

892
02:22:06,902 --> 02:22:08,893
Foods and weapons. They will...

893
02:22:09,038 --> 02:22:11,097
No, stop.

894
02:22:12,541 --> 02:22:14,634
Why do you help me?

895
02:22:21,017 --> 02:22:23,076
Why do you help me?

896
02:22:23,886 --> 02:22:26,616
Because of the way you are looking at me now.

897
02:24:19,368 --> 02:24:21,734
Just when we thought all hope was lost,

898
02:24:21,804 --> 02:24:24,466
our noble saviors have arrived.

899
02:24:27,843 --> 02:24:29,936
Off with their hoods.

900
02:24:34,183 --> 02:24:36,981
Sir William, we come to seek a meeting.

901
02:24:37,086 --> 02:24:39,179
Well, what's the point?

902
02:24:40,356 --> 02:24:44,759
- You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks. - An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

903
02:24:44,827 --> 02:24:47,591
Every man of us is ready to swear loyalty to you.

904
02:24:47,663 --> 02:24:49,756
So let the council swear publicly.

905
02:24:50,433 --> 02:24:53,869
We cannot. Some scarcely believe you're alive.

906
02:24:53,969 --> 02:24:58,201
Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages. So we bid you to Edinburgh.

907
02:24:58,274 --> 02:25:02,574
Meet us two days from now. Pledge us your pardon and we'll unite behind you.

908
02:25:02,645 --> 02:25:04,704
- Scotland will be one. - One?

909
02:25:04,814 --> 02:25:07,282
- You mean us and you. - No.

910
02:25:09,051 --> 02:25:11,383
l mean this.

911
02:25:13,189 --> 02:25:15,589
lt's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

912
02:25:25,201 --> 02:25:27,226
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

913
02:25:27,303 --> 02:25:30,739
lf the Bruce wanted to kill you, he'd have done it at Falkirk.

914
02:25:30,840 --> 02:25:32,000
Aye.

915
02:25:32,074 --> 02:25:33,666
l know. l saw.

916
02:25:33,742 --> 02:25:37,269
All right, leaving him aside, what about the others?

917
02:25:37,346 --> 02:25:42,841
Scheming bastards who couldnae agree on the color of shite. lt's a trap. Are you blind?

918
02:25:42,918 --> 02:25:45,011
Look at us.

919
02:25:45,888 --> 02:25:48,448
We've got to try. We can't do this alone.

920
02:25:50,059 --> 02:25:54,428
Joining the nobles is our only hope. You know what happens if we don't?

921
02:25:54,497 --> 02:25:56,089
What?

922
02:25:56,232 --> 02:25:57,859
Nothing.

923
02:25:59,268 --> 02:26:02,760
- l don't want to be a martyr. - Nor l.

924
02:26:02,872 --> 02:26:04,931
l want to live.

925
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:07,736
l want a home, and children. And peace.

926
02:26:07,843 --> 02:26:09,902
- Do ye? - Aye, l do.

927
02:26:09,979 --> 02:26:14,541
l've asked God for those things. lt's all for nothing if you don't have freedom.

928
02:26:14,650 --> 02:26:17,585
- lt's just a dream, William. - A dream? Just a...

929
02:26:18,654 --> 02:26:22,317
Well, then, what have we been doing all this time?

930
02:26:23,459 --> 02:26:25,086
We've lived that dream.

931
02:26:25,194 --> 02:26:28,357
Your dream isn't about freedom. lt's about Murron.

932
02:26:28,464 --> 02:26:31,763
You're doing this to be a hero because you think she sees ye.

933
02:26:31,867 --> 02:26:34,131
l don't think she sees me. l know she does.

934
02:26:35,204 --> 02:26:38,196
And your father sees you, too.

935
02:26:47,950 --> 02:26:49,542
Jesus.

936
02:26:56,959 --> 02:26:59,018
Shall l come with you?

937
02:27:00,129 --> 02:27:02,962
No. l'll go alone.

938
02:27:04,733 --> 02:27:07,634
- l'll see you after. - Right.

939
02:27:12,641 --> 02:27:14,802
Sooner rather than later, l hope.

940
02:27:21,317 --> 02:27:23,376
- He won't come. - He will.

941
02:27:24,820 --> 02:27:26,913
l know he will.

942
02:27:40,469 --> 02:27:42,562
My Lord. He approaches.

943
02:28:26,615 --> 02:28:28,674
No!

944
02:28:33,389 --> 02:28:35,448
Stay out of it, Robert.

945
02:28:36,992 --> 02:28:38,653
Get away.

946
02:28:42,331 --> 02:28:45,664
The Bruce is not to be harmed, that's the arrangement.

947
02:28:53,442 --> 02:28:54,932
Father!

948
02:29:00,916 --> 02:29:03,749
You rotting bastard!

949
02:29:04,453 --> 02:29:06,045
Why?

950
02:29:11,060 --> 02:29:13,119
Longshanks required Wallace.

951
02:29:14,363 --> 02:29:16,456
So did our nobles.

952
02:29:16,532 --> 02:29:19,763
That was the price of your crown.

953
02:29:19,868 --> 02:29:21,130
Die.

954
02:29:22,638 --> 02:29:24,697
l want you to die.

955
02:29:24,773 --> 02:29:27,071
Soon enough l'll be dead.

956
02:29:27,142 --> 02:29:31,135
- And you'll be King. - l don't want anything from you.

957
02:29:31,780 --> 02:29:33,873
You're not a man.

958
02:29:34,650 --> 02:29:36,709
And you're not my father.

959
02:29:40,355 --> 02:29:42,448
You're my son

960
02:29:42,524 --> 02:29:44,924
and you have always known my mind.

961
02:29:47,329 --> 02:29:50,492
- You deceived me. - You let yourself be deceived.

962
02:29:51,266 --> 02:29:54,758
ln your heart, you always knew what had to happen here.

963
02:29:58,340 --> 02:30:01,503
At last, you know what it means to hate.

964
02:30:06,381 --> 02:30:08,781
Now you're ready to be a king.

965
02:30:10,519 --> 02:30:12,384
My hate...

966
02:30:12,488 --> 02:30:14,615
will die with you.

967
02:30:20,129 --> 02:30:24,088
William Wallace, you stand in taint of high treason.

968
02:30:25,400 --> 02:30:28,597
- Against whom? - Against your King.

969
02:30:29,905 --> 02:30:31,964
Have you anything to say?

970
02:30:32,841 --> 02:30:34,934
Never in my whole life

971
02:30:36,445 --> 02:30:38,640
did l swear allegiance to him.

972
02:30:40,048 --> 02:30:43,142
lt matters not. He is your King.

973
02:30:45,220 --> 02:30:48,621
Confess and you may receive a quick death.

974
02:30:49,458 --> 02:30:52,393
Deny and you must be purified by pain.

975
02:30:52,461 --> 02:30:54,554
Do you confess?

976
02:30:56,198 --> 02:30:59,395
Do you confess?

977
02:31:05,040 --> 02:31:08,635
Then on the morrow you shall receive your purification.

978
02:31:20,389 --> 02:31:22,857
- Your Highness. - l will see the prisoner.

979
02:31:22,958 --> 02:31:26,826
- The King ordered... - The King will die soon and his son is weak.

980
02:31:26,895 --> 02:31:29,261
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

981
02:31:29,398 --> 02:31:31,457
Now open this door.

982
02:31:33,202 --> 02:31:35,261
Your Majesty.

983
02:31:40,876 --> 02:31:42,901
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

984
02:31:43,011 --> 02:31:45,912
Stop it. Leave me.

985
02:31:47,649 --> 02:31:49,708
l said leave me.

986
02:32:02,531 --> 02:32:04,590
My Lady.

987
02:32:04,666 --> 02:32:06,725
Sir...

988
02:32:07,469 --> 02:32:09,528
l come to beg you...

989
02:32:10,939 --> 02:32:15,842
to confess all and swear allegiance to the King that he might show you mercy.

990
02:32:16,879 --> 02:32:19,211
Will he show mercy to my country?

991
02:32:20,082 --> 02:32:22,141
Mercy is to die quickly,

992
02:32:22,251 --> 02:32:24,310
perhaps even live in the Tower.

993
02:32:24,453 --> 02:32:27,013
ln time, who knows what can happen?

994
02:32:28,690 --> 02:32:30,749
lf you can only live...

995
02:32:35,230 --> 02:32:37,289
lf l swear to him...

996
02:32:37,933 --> 02:32:41,130
then all that l am is dead already.

997
02:32:50,545 --> 02:32:52,706
You will die. lt will be awful.

998
02:32:52,781 --> 02:32:54,874
Every man dies.

999
02:32:57,786 --> 02:32:59,879
Not every man really lives.

1000
02:33:06,528 --> 02:33:08,587
Drink this.

1001
02:33:09,097 --> 02:33:11,156
lt will dull your pain.

1002
02:33:11,266 --> 02:33:13,666
No. lt will numb my wits.

1003
02:33:13,735 --> 02:33:15,794
And l must have them all.

1004
02:33:16,571 --> 02:33:19,131
For if l'm senseless or if l wail

1005
02:33:19,207 --> 02:33:21,539
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1006
02:33:22,177 --> 02:33:24,805
l can't bear the thought of your torture.

1007
02:33:25,681 --> 02:33:27,740
Take it.

1008
02:33:32,154 --> 02:33:33,815
All right.

1009
02:34:20,669 --> 02:34:22,762
l have come

1010
02:34:22,838 --> 02:34:25,204
to beg for the life of William Wallace.

1011
02:34:27,576 --> 02:34:30,443
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1012
02:34:30,579 --> 02:34:32,672
l respect him.

1013
02:34:33,815 --> 02:34:36,010
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1014
02:34:36,084 --> 02:34:40,248
Show mercy, O thou great King, and win the respect of your own people.

1015
02:34:50,065 --> 02:34:52,158
Even now

1016
02:34:52,901 --> 02:34:55,392
you are incapable of mercy.

1017
02:35:01,810 --> 02:35:03,869
And you...

1018
02:35:07,215 --> 02:35:10,412
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1019
02:35:11,453 --> 02:35:13,978
Before he lost his powers of speech

1020
02:35:14,056 --> 02:35:18,186
he told me his one comfort was that he would live to know Wallace was dead.

1021
02:35:37,279 --> 02:35:39,338
You see?

1022
02:35:40,549 --> 02:35:42,642
Death comes to us all.

1023
02:35:52,694 --> 02:35:54,753
But before it comes to you,

1024
02:35:55,764 --> 02:35:57,857
know this:

1025
02:35:58,066 --> 02:36:00,125
Your blood dies with you.

1026
02:36:02,838 --> 02:36:06,274
A child who is not of your line grows in my belly.

1027
02:36:09,177 --> 02:36:13,045
Your son will not sit long on the throne, l swear it.

1028
02:36:51,286 --> 02:36:53,345
l'm so afraid.

1029
02:37:00,629 --> 02:37:02,722
Give me the strength...

1030
02:37:03,632 --> 02:37:05,725
to die well.

1031
02:37:29,224 --> 02:37:31,055
Here he comes.

1032
02:38:59,848 --> 02:39:02,214
Now behold the awful price of treason.

1033
02:39:09,124 --> 02:39:11,217
Or fall to your knees now,

1034
02:39:13,628 --> 02:39:16,426
declare yourself the King's loyal subject

1035
02:39:17,666 --> 02:39:19,497
and beg his mercy

1036
02:39:26,474 --> 02:39:28,533
and you shall have it.

1037
02:39:39,921 --> 02:39:41,445
Rope.

1038
02:39:54,069 --> 02:39:56,128
Raise him.

1039
02:40:03,211 --> 02:40:05,509
Stretch him.

1040
02:40:07,115 --> 02:40:09,106
That's it.

1041
02:40:09,184 --> 02:40:11,277
Stretch him.

1042
02:40:47,422 --> 02:40:49,617
Pleasant, yes?

1043
02:40:52,861 --> 02:40:54,795
Rise to your knees.

1044
02:40:54,863 --> 02:40:57,730
Kiss the royal emblem on my cloak

1045
02:40:57,832 --> 02:40:59,527
and you will feel no more.

1046
02:41:41,309 --> 02:41:43,277
Rack him.

1047
02:42:37,432 --> 02:42:39,093
Enough?

1048
02:43:31,753 --> 02:43:33,812
lt can all end...

1049
02:43:34,122 --> 02:43:36,386
right now.

1050
02:43:36,491 --> 02:43:38,152
Peace.

1051
02:43:38,960 --> 02:43:40,518
Bliss.

1052
02:43:41,162 --> 02:43:42,424
Just say it.

1053
02:43:43,565 --> 02:43:45,624
Cry out...

1054
02:43:45,733 --> 02:43:47,394
''Mercy.''

1055
02:43:56,344 --> 02:43:57,777
Mercy.

1056
02:43:57,912 --> 02:43:59,971
Mercy.

1057
02:44:05,920 --> 02:44:06,978
Cry out.

1058
02:44:13,728 --> 02:44:17,664
Just say it. ''Mercy.''

1059
02:44:40,788 --> 02:44:45,248
- Mercy, William. Mercy. - Jesus, man, say it.

1060
02:44:50,999 --> 02:44:54,457
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1061
02:45:14,288 --> 02:45:17,587
Freedom!

1062
02:47:09,971 --> 02:47:12,405
After the beheading,

1063
02:47:12,507 --> 02:47:15,840
William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.

1064
02:47:18,513 --> 02:47:21,311
His head was set on London Bridge.

1065
02:47:23,050 --> 02:47:25,518
His arms and legs

1066
02:47:25,586 --> 02:47:28,316
sent to the four corners of Britain

1067
02:47:28,823 --> 02:47:30,916
as a warning.

1068
02:47:30,992 --> 02:47:34,826
lt did not have the effect that Longshanks planned.

1069
02:47:36,664 --> 02:47:39,792
And l, Robert the Bruce,

1070
02:47:39,867 --> 02:47:44,065
rode out to pay homage to the armies of the English King

1071
02:47:45,139 --> 02:47:48,370
and accept his endorsement of my crown.

1072
02:47:48,442 --> 02:47:50,967
l hope you've washed your arse this morning.

1073
02:47:51,746 --> 02:47:53,805
lt's about to be kissed by a king.

1074
02:48:23,811 --> 02:48:25,870
Come. Let's get it over with.

1075
02:48:38,392 --> 02:48:40,326
Stop.

1076
02:48:57,645 --> 02:49:00,614
You have bled with Wallace!

1077
02:49:05,853 --> 02:49:08,515
Now bleed with me.

1078
02:49:47,995 --> 02:49:50,691
Wallace!

1079
02:50:14,922 --> 02:50:17,982
ln the year of our Lord 1314,

1080
02:50:18,926 --> 02:50:22,191
patriots of Scotland, starving and outnumbered,

1081
02:50:22,830 --> 02:50:25,697
charged the fields of Bannockburn.

1082
02:50:26,300 --> 02:50:28,632
They fought like warrior poets.

1083
02:50:29,170 --> 02:50:31,365
They fought like Scotsmen

1084
02:50:32,406 --> 02:50:34,499
and won their freedom.
