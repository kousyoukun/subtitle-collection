1
00:00:42,813 --> 00:00:47,182

2
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:43,502
I shall tell you of William Wallace.

3
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,370
Historians from England will say I am a liar.

4
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:51,811
But history is written by
those who have hanged heroes.

5
00:01:52,615 --> 00:01:55,709
The King of Scotland had died without a son.

6
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,650
And the King of England,

7
00:01:57,754 --> 00:02:01,383
a cruel pagan known as Edward the Longshanks,

8
00:02:01,524 --> 00:02:04,516
claimed the throne of Scotland for himself.

9
00:02:05,128 --> 00:02:08,256
Scotland's nobles fought him

10
00:02:08,365 --> 00:02:10,959
and fought each other over the crown.

11
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:15,503
So Longshanks invited
them to talks of a truce.

12
00:02:15,605 --> 00:02:19,006
No weapons. One page only.

13
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:25,872
One farmer of that shire was Malcolm Wallace,

14
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:28,450
a commoner with his own
lands. He had two sons:

15
00:02:28,551 --> 00:02:30,644
John and William.

16
00:02:37,394 --> 00:02:39,487
I told you to stay.

17
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,929
Well, I finished my work. Where are we going?

18
00:02:44,033 --> 00:02:47,093
MacAndrews'. He was supposed
to visit after the gathering.

19
00:02:47,203 --> 00:02:47,965
Can I come?

20
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:50,835
- No. Go home, boy.
- But I want to go.

21
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,465
Go home, or you'll feel the back of my hand.

22
00:02:53,843 --> 00:02:55,435
Away hame, William.

23
00:03:20,136 --> 00:03:21,569
MacAndrews.

24
00:03:26,443 --> 00:03:27,808

25
00:03:37,187 --> 00:03:38,677
Holy Jesus.

26
00:04:22,732 --> 00:04:25,530
William.

27
00:04:28,104 --> 00:04:31,505
It's all right, it's all right. Easy, lad.

28
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,283
William.

29
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:54,296
And I say we hit back now.

30
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:55,864
Wallace is right.

31
00:04:58,835 --> 00:04:59,733
We fight them.

32
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:02,202
Every nobleman willing to
fight was at that meeting.

33
00:05:02,305 --> 00:05:03,772
We cannot beat an army.

34
00:05:03,873 --> 00:05:05,636
Not with the 50 farmers we can raise.

35
00:05:05,742 --> 00:05:07,733
We do not have to beat them...

36
00:05:07,944 --> 00:05:09,571
Just fight them.

37
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,837
Now, who's with me?

38
00:05:10,947 --> 00:05:12,642
I am, Wallace.

39
00:05:14,017 --> 00:05:15,450
All right.

40
00:05:31,568 --> 00:05:33,001
Where do you think you're going?

41
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:34,501
With you.

42
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:36,331
Och, are ye?

43
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,737
And what are you going to do?

44
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,102
I'm gonna help.

45
00:05:40,076 --> 00:05:41,907
And a good help you'll be, too.

46
00:05:44,113 --> 00:05:48,914
But I need you to stay here and look
after the place for me while I'm away.

47
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,182
I can fight.

48
00:05:55,325 --> 00:05:56,758
I know.

49
00:05:57,093 --> 00:05:59,084
I know you can fight.

50
00:06:03,866 --> 00:06:07,461
But it's our wits that make us men.

51
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,571
See ye tomorrow.

52
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:46,840
- English.
- Get down.

53
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,178
With your father and brother gone,

54
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,246
they'll kill us and burn the farm.

55
00:06:51,848 --> 00:06:53,577
It's up to us, Hamish.

56
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:00,246
Da?

57
00:08:06,856 --> 00:08:07,982

58
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,162
William.

59
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:26,695
Come here, lad.

60
00:10:57,426 --> 00:11:00,020

61
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:54,935
William.

62
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:58,376
I'm your uncle.

63
00:12:58,981 --> 00:13:00,380
Argyle.

64
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:14,696
You have the look of your mother.

65
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:27,940
We'll stay here tonight.

66
00:13:28,344 --> 00:13:30,312
Tomorrow, you'll come home with me.

67
00:13:30,713 --> 00:13:32,408
I don't want to leave.

68
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:36,948
You didn't want your father
to die either, did you?

69
00:13:37,153 --> 00:13:38,745
But it happened.

70
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:45,659
Did the priest give a poetic benediction?

71
00:13:46,195 --> 00:13:47,492
The Lord bless thee and keep thee...

72
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,564
It was in Latin.

73
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:51,563
You don't speak Latin?

74
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:56,763
That's something we shall have to remedy.

75
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,538
The Lord

76
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:03,871
bless thee and keep thee.

77
00:14:04,046 --> 00:14:07,243
The Lord cause his light to shine on thee.

78
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:10,350
The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee

79
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,213
and give thee peace.

80
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,051
Amen.

81
00:14:21,597 --> 00:14:23,861
Your heart is free.

82
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:27,700
Have the courage to follow it.

83
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:55,894
What are they doing?

84
00:14:56,799 --> 00:14:59,063
Saying goodbye in their own way.

85
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:03,971
Playing outlawed tunes on outlawed pipes.

86
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:16,477
It was the same for me and your daddy

87
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:19,310
when our father was killed.

88
00:15:45,614 --> 00:15:49,448
First, learn to use...

89
00:15:49,552 --> 00:15:51,110
this.

90
00:15:51,453 --> 00:15:54,718
Then I'll teach you... to use

91
00:15:54,957 --> 00:15:56,618
this.

92
00:16:24,653 --> 00:16:26,143

93
00:16:26,555 --> 00:16:27,715
Many years later,

94
00:16:27,823 --> 00:16:30,223
Edward the Longshanks, King of England,

95
00:16:30,326 --> 00:16:32,851
supervised the wedding of his eldest son,

96
00:16:32,962 --> 00:16:35,795
who would succeed him as king.

97
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:40,094
Amen.

98
00:16:44,974 --> 00:16:46,942
As bride for his son,

99
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:52,480
Longshanks had chosen the daughter
of his rival, the King of France.

100
00:17:15,804 --> 00:17:19,399
It was widely whispered that
for the Princess to conceive,

101
00:17:19,508 --> 00:17:22,909
Longshanks would have to
do the honors himself.

102
00:17:23,445 --> 00:17:27,711
That may have been what
he had in mind all along.

103
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:32,712
Scotland...

104
00:17:33,389 --> 00:17:35,516
My land.

105
00:17:37,126 --> 00:17:42,189
The French will grovel
to anyone with strength.

106
00:17:42,331 --> 00:17:44,697
But how will they believe our strength

107
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:47,633
when we cannot rule the whole of our island?

108
00:17:58,647 --> 00:18:00,046
Where is my son?

109
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:01,713
Your pardon, my Lord.

110
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:03,808
He asked me to come in his stead.

111
00:18:04,386 --> 00:18:07,184
I sent for him and he sends you?

112
00:18:07,556 --> 00:18:09,285
Shall I leave, my Lord?

113
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:14,592
If he wants his queen to rule when I am gone,

114
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:16,995
then by all means stay

115
00:18:17,099 --> 00:18:19,363
and learn how. Please.

116
00:18:23,305 --> 00:18:25,068
Nobles.

117
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,971
Nobles are the key to the door of Scotland.

118
00:18:29,111 --> 00:18:32,603
Grant our nobles lands in the North.

119
00:18:32,715 --> 00:18:36,412
Give their nobles estates here in England.

120
00:18:36,518 --> 00:18:39,453
And make them too greedy to oppose us.

121
00:18:39,555 --> 00:18:41,887
But, sir, our nobles will
be reluctant to uproot.

122
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,390
New lands mean new taxes

123
00:18:44,493 --> 00:18:46,461
and they're already taxed
for the war in France.

124
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:50,760
Are they?

125
00:19:09,451 --> 00:19:11,817
The trouble with Scotland

126
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,946
is that it's full of Scots.

127
00:19:18,293 --> 00:19:24,095
Perhaps the time has come to
reinstitute an old custom.

128
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:27,600
Grant them primae noctis.

129
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,535
First night.

130
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:34,805
When any common girl inhabiting
their lands is married,

131
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:41,042
our nobles shall have sexual rights
to her on the night of her wedding.

132
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:45,184
If we can't get them out,

133
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:48,819
we'll breed them out.

134
00:19:49,024 --> 00:19:53,188
That should fetch just the kind
of lords we want to Scotland.

135
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,627
Taxes or no taxes?

136
00:19:55,731 --> 00:19:57,528
A most excellent idea, sire.

137
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,032
Is it?

138
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:04,100

139
00:20:04,306 --> 00:20:05,637
Now, in Edinburgh

140
00:20:05,741 --> 00:20:08,904
were gathered the council of Scottish nobles.

141
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:11,477
Among these was Robert,

142
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:13,673
the 17th Earl of Bruce,

143
00:20:13,882 --> 00:20:16,976
a leading contender for
the crown of Scotland.

144
00:20:19,221 --> 00:20:21,712

145
00:20:23,025 --> 00:20:24,151
I hear that

146
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,659
Longshanks has granted primae noctis.

147
00:20:27,229 --> 00:20:30,221
Clearly meant to draw more
of his supporters here.

148
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:33,131
My father believes we must

149
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:35,893
lull Longshanks into our confidence

150
00:20:36,004 --> 00:20:38,268
by neither supporting his
decree nor opposing it.

151
00:20:38,373 --> 00:20:39,567
A wise plan.

152
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,934
How is your father? He missed the council.

153
00:20:42,044 --> 00:20:44,877
His affairs in France keep him long overdue.

154
00:20:50,052 --> 00:20:52,111
But he sends his greetings.

155
00:20:52,287 --> 00:20:55,256
And he says that I speak
for all of the Bruces

156
00:20:55,457 --> 00:20:57,049
and for Scotland.

157
00:23:09,591 --> 00:23:11,354
You've dropped your rock.

158
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,087
A test of manhood.

159
00:23:14,863 --> 00:23:16,023
You win.

160
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:20,294
Call it a test of soldiery, then.

161
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:22,866
The English won't let us train with weapons,

162
00:23:23,105 --> 00:23:24,538
so we use stones.

163
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,040
The test of a soldier is not in his arm.

164
00:23:27,576 --> 00:23:28,474
It's here.

165
00:23:28,577 --> 00:23:29,601
No.

166
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:31,134
It's here.

167
00:23:37,519 --> 00:23:39,282
Hamish?

168
00:23:52,934 --> 00:23:53,866
Here you go, son.

169
00:23:53,969 --> 00:23:55,163
Show him how.

170
00:23:59,941 --> 00:24:01,875
Come on.

171
00:24:14,256 --> 00:24:15,450
That's a good throw.

172
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:18,517
Aye. Aye, it was.

173
00:24:19,027 --> 00:24:21,962
I was wondering if you could
do that when it matters.

174
00:24:25,033 --> 00:24:27,331
As it... as it matters in battle.

175
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:31,537
Could you crush a man with that throw?

176
00:24:31,773 --> 00:24:34,833
I could crush you... like a worm.

177
00:24:36,945 --> 00:24:37,809
You could?

178
00:24:37,913 --> 00:24:39,346
Aye.

179
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:40,748
Well, then, do it.

180
00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,783
Like to see him crush me like a worm?

181
00:24:47,889 --> 00:24:48,685
Come and do it.

182
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:49,484
You'll move.

183
00:24:49,591 --> 00:24:50,717
I will not.

184
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:52,615
Right.

185
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:54,389
He'll move.

186
00:24:57,499 --> 00:24:59,558
Come on there, boy.

187
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:10,140
Well done.

188
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,687
Are you all right? You look a wee bit shaky.

189
00:25:29,965 --> 00:25:31,432
I should have remembered the rocks.

190
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:39,531
Get up, you big heap of...

191
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:42,309
It's good to see ye again.

192
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,843
Aye, welcome home.

193
00:25:46,681 --> 00:25:50,139
- Look what you did to my head.
- You should have moved.

194
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:02,593
William, will you dance with me?

195
00:26:04,032 --> 00:26:05,693
Of course I will.

196
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:34,456
I've come to claim the
right of primae noctis.

197
00:26:34,563 --> 00:26:40,399
As lord of these lands, I will bless this
marriage by taking the bride into my bed

198
00:26:40,502 --> 00:26:42,834
on the first night of her union.

199
00:26:42,938 --> 00:26:44,769
By God you will not!

200
00:26:49,177 --> 00:26:51,907
It is my noble right.

201
00:28:52,834 --> 00:28:53,926
Good evening, sir.

202
00:28:54,035 --> 00:28:55,730
Ah, young Wallace.

203
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:57,996
A grand soft evening.

204
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,768
Aye, it's that.

205
00:28:59,941 --> 00:29:02,409
Might I have a word with your daughter?

206
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,804
What do you want to have a word about?

207
00:29:08,483 --> 00:29:09,415
Murron,

208
00:29:09,517 --> 00:29:12,111
would you like to ride with
me on this fine evening?

209
00:29:14,289 --> 00:29:16,985
In this? You're out of your mind.

210
00:29:17,092 --> 00:29:18,753
It's good Scottish weather, madam.

211
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:21,829
The rain is falling almost straight down.

212
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,158
She cannae go with you.

213
00:29:23,365 --> 00:29:24,627
No?

214
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,892
No the now, anyway.

215
00:29:27,035 --> 00:29:28,627
- No the now.
- No the now.

216
00:29:29,037 --> 00:29:30,004
We'll see ye later.

217
00:29:30,105 --> 00:29:32,471
The weather's fine. It's hardly raining.

218
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,371
Did you no hear what I said? Murron.

219
00:29:40,181 --> 00:29:41,648
It's you she takes after.

220
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,645
How did you know me after so long?

221
00:30:13,882 --> 00:30:15,076
I didn't.

222
00:30:15,717 --> 00:30:18,584
I saw you staring at me and
I didn't know who you were.

223
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:20,846
I'm sorry. I suppose I was.

224
00:30:23,625 --> 00:30:26,526
Are you in the habit of
riding off with strangers?

225
00:30:26,694 --> 00:30:28,787
It was the best way to make you leave.

226
00:30:32,167 --> 00:30:34,965
If I ever find the courage to ask ye again,

227
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,367
I'll warn you in writing first.

228
00:30:36,471 --> 00:30:38,439
It wouldn't help. I can't read.

229
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,633
- Can ye not?
- No.

230
00:30:43,545 --> 00:30:46,139
That's something we shall have to remedy.

231
00:30:46,281 --> 00:30:47,441
You'll teach me to read?

232
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,982
Aye, if you like.

233
00:30:49,084 --> 00:30:52,178
- Aye.
- In what language?

234
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:55,055
You're showing off now.

235
00:30:55,156 --> 00:30:56,316
That's right. Are you impressed yet?

236
00:30:56,424 --> 00:30:58,449
No. Should I be?

237
00:30:59,861 --> 00:31:04,423

238
00:31:06,768 --> 00:31:10,033
Do that standing on your
head, and I'll be impressed.

239
00:31:10,338 --> 00:31:12,499
My kilt'll fly up, but I'll try.

240
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,631
You learnt no manners on your travels.

241
00:31:14,742 --> 00:31:17,540
The French and the Romans
are far worse than I.

242
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:18,543
You went to Rome?

243
00:31:18,646 --> 00:31:20,546
Uncle took me on a pilgrimage.

244
00:31:20,782 --> 00:31:22,147
What was it like?

245
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:25,676

246
00:31:27,655 --> 00:31:29,452
What does that mean?

247
00:31:29,858 --> 00:31:31,758
Beautiful.

248
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,223
But I belong here.

249
00:32:09,531 --> 00:32:11,897
Murron, Come in now.

250
00:33:22,737 --> 00:33:27,071
Sir, I know it was strange of me to
invite Murron to ride last night, but...

251
00:33:27,175 --> 00:33:28,904
MacClannough's daughter is another matter.

252
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:32,036
I've come to fetch you to a meeting.

253
00:33:33,448 --> 00:33:34,881
What kind of meeting?

254
00:33:34,983 --> 00:33:36,041
The secret kind.

255
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,414
Your meetings are a waste of time.

256
00:33:40,521 --> 00:33:42,386
Your father was a fighter

257
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:44,885
and a patriot.

258
00:33:46,794 --> 00:33:48,887
I know who my father was.

259
00:33:50,164 --> 00:33:54,430
I came home to raise crops
and, God willing, a family.

260
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,697
If I can live in peace, I will.

261
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,606
You want to stay out of the troubles?

262
00:34:00,708 --> 00:34:01,675
Aye.

263
00:34:01,776 --> 00:34:04,108
If you can prove it, you
may court my daughter.

264
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:06,879
Until you prove it, the answer is no.

265
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,039
No.

266
00:34:08,149 --> 00:34:10,276
No, Wallace. No.

267
00:34:10,451 --> 00:34:11,543
Didn't I just prove it?

268
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,679
- No. No!
- No?

269
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:59,665
Of course, running a farm is a lot of work.

270
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:02,392
But that will all change when my sons arrive.

271
00:35:03,805 --> 00:35:05,670
So, you've got children.

272
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,838
Well, not yet.

273
00:35:06,941 --> 00:35:09,466
But I was hoping that you
could help me with that.

274
00:35:10,445 --> 00:35:12,413
So you want me to marry you, then?

275
00:35:12,513 --> 00:35:14,481
Well, it's a bit sudden, but all right.

276
00:35:14,882 --> 00:35:16,782
Is that what you call a proposal?

277
00:35:18,286 --> 00:35:19,480
I love you.

278
00:35:20,154 --> 00:35:21,621
Always have.

279
00:35:23,391 --> 00:35:24,688
I want to marry you.

280
00:35:37,372 --> 00:35:38,737
Is that a yes?

281
00:35:39,006 --> 00:35:40,598
- Aye, that's a yes.
- Yeah?

282
00:36:24,252 --> 00:36:25,879
We'd best hurry. He'll be waiting.

283
00:36:25,987 --> 00:36:26,919
Oh, wait.

284
00:36:27,021 --> 00:36:28,045
Where are you going?

285
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:35,953
What's that?

286
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:37,189
You'll see.

287
00:36:56,017 --> 00:36:57,177
Father.

288
00:37:10,298 --> 00:37:12,027
I will love you my whole life.

289
00:37:13,534 --> 00:37:15,365
You and no other.

290
00:37:20,441 --> 00:37:22,136
And I you.

291
00:37:22,944 --> 00:37:25,378
You and no other... for ever.

292
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,180

293
00:40:53,654 --> 00:40:56,179
When will I see ye again? Tonight?

294
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:57,553
I can't.

295
00:40:57,658 --> 00:41:00,024
Why not? My dad's growing suspicious.

296
00:41:00,127 --> 00:41:01,958
Would that have anything to do with...

297
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:04,292
When?

298
00:41:05,132 --> 00:41:06,156

299
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:07,658
When?

300
00:41:08,135 --> 00:41:11,271
- Tonight.
- Tonight?

301
00:41:17,712 --> 00:41:19,407
Look lively, Sergeant.

302
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:32,691
What are you carrying, lassie?

303
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,928
That looks heavy. Can we help you?

304
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:36,591
That's fine.

305
00:41:36,597 --> 00:41:01,090
I'm not going to steal it...

306
00:41:41,302 --> 00:41:43,463
You remind me of my daughter back home.

307
00:41:57,251 --> 00:41:58,445
Hello, lassie.

308
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:11,964

309
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:15,430
Keep quiet, Smythe.

310
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:25,074
You bitch.

311
00:42:32,786 --> 00:42:34,014
You bitch.

312
00:42:42,429 --> 00:42:45,762
Are you all right?

313
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,969
- Are you all right?
- Aye.

314
00:43:00,447 --> 00:43:01,505
- Can you ride?
- Aye.

315
00:43:07,154 --> 00:43:09,816
Come back here, you bastard!

316
00:43:10,291 --> 00:43:13,055
Ring the alarm. Help!

317
00:43:14,028 --> 00:43:16,360
Meet me at the grove. Ride!

318
00:43:16,864 --> 00:43:18,422
They're getting away.

319
00:44:01,342 --> 00:44:03,435
All right, you bitch.

320
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:27,598
Murron.

321
00:44:35,209 --> 00:44:36,574

322
00:44:45,286 --> 00:44:47,413
All of you know full well

323
00:44:47,821 --> 00:44:50,255
the great pains I've always taken

324
00:44:51,125 --> 00:44:55,687
never to be too strict, too rigid,
with the application of our laws.

325
00:44:56,563 --> 00:44:58,588
And, as a consequence,

326
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:01,994
have we not learned to live together

327
00:45:02,102 --> 00:45:05,094
in relative peace and harmony?

328
00:45:10,044 --> 00:45:16,142
And this... day's lawlessness
is how you repay my leniency.

329
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,093
You leave me with little choice.

330
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:37,567
An assault on the King's soldiers

331
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:42,475
is the same as an assault
on the King himself.

332
00:45:58,525 --> 00:46:00,015
Now,

333
00:46:00,694 --> 00:46:03,595
let this scrapper come to me.

334
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,814
There.

335
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:28,251
Corporal.

336
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:29,989
Some archers on the tower. Now!

337
00:50:40,607 --> 00:50:41,869
Hold still, Father.

338
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,041
You idiot, boy.

339
00:52:08,962 --> 00:52:11,556
- Father, are you all right?
- Aye.

340
00:53:34,147 --> 00:53:39,141
MacCaulich.

341
00:53:41,588 --> 00:53:43,215

342
00:53:44,191 --> 00:54:00,631
Wallace.

343
00:56:16,276 --> 00:56:18,107
What are you waiting for, boy?

344
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,206
Here. You can do it.

345
00:56:21,314 --> 00:56:22,611
I'll hold him down.

346
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:26,842
Here. You can do it.

347
00:56:26,953 --> 00:56:28,352
I'll hold him down.

348
00:56:28,722 --> 00:56:30,189
Pour it straight in the wound, boy.

349
00:56:30,523 --> 00:56:33,890
I know it seems like a waste
of good whisky. lndulge me.

350
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:40,097
Hold him. Hold him. Hold him.

351
00:56:40,834 --> 00:56:42,426
Now, let him go.

352
00:56:46,873 --> 00:56:48,306
All right?

353
00:56:48,675 --> 00:56:50,905
That'll wake you up in the morning, boy.

354
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:53,469
There's somebody coming.

355
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:55,411
Arm yourselves.

356
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:01,948
There's somebody coming.

357
00:57:04,024 --> 00:57:05,457
MacGregors.

358
00:57:05,558 --> 00:57:06,820
From the next glen.

359
00:57:11,831 --> 00:57:13,958
We heard about what was happening.

360
00:57:14,434 --> 00:57:18,393
We don't want you amerdans thinking
you can have your fun without us.

361
00:57:18,505 --> 00:57:19,972

362
00:57:20,373 --> 00:57:22,102
Go home.

363
00:57:22,776 --> 00:57:25,040
Some of us are in this.

364
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,477
I can't help that now.

365
00:57:28,081 --> 00:57:29,878
But you can help yourselves.

366
00:57:29,983 --> 00:57:31,143
Go home.

367
00:57:31,251 --> 00:57:32,650
We'll have no homes left

368
00:57:32,752 --> 00:57:35,744
when the English garrison burns us out.

369
00:57:36,856 --> 00:57:38,551
- And they will.
- Aye.

370
00:57:41,728 --> 00:57:43,320
Welcome.

371
00:58:12,726 --> 00:58:14,421
Patrol returning, my Lord.

372
00:58:42,822 --> 00:58:44,153
So, what news?

373
00:58:56,269 --> 00:58:59,170
I have dispatched 100 soldiers to Lanark.

374
00:58:59,339 --> 00:59:01,170
They will be returning now.

375
00:59:01,274 --> 00:59:03,538
Were they dressed like this?

376
00:59:04,611 --> 00:59:06,374
Actually, it was more like 50.

377
00:59:07,247 --> 00:59:08,612
Make it quick.

378
00:59:11,384 --> 00:59:13,249
Do you remember me?

379
00:59:14,654 --> 00:59:16,986
I never did her any harm. It was my right.

380
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,216

381
00:59:18,324 --> 00:59:21,418
I'm here to claim the right of a husband!

382
00:59:28,101 --> 00:59:29,830
I'm William Wallace.

383
00:59:32,138 --> 00:59:34,197
And the rest of you will be spared.

384
00:59:35,141 --> 00:59:38,406
Go back to England. And tell them there

385
00:59:38,778 --> 00:59:42,214
that Scotland's daughters and
her sons are yours no more.

386
00:59:44,584 --> 00:59:46,950
Tell them Scotland is free.

387
00:59:52,725 --> 00:59:53,783
Burn it.

388
01:00:28,094 --> 01:00:32,963
The Scottish rebels have
routed one of my garrisons

389
01:00:33,066 --> 01:00:35,227
and murdered the noble Lord.

390
01:00:35,335 --> 01:00:36,563
I heard.

391
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:39,636
This Wallace is a brigand, nothing more.

392
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:42,669
And how would you deal with this... brigand?

393
01:00:42,775 --> 01:00:44,606
Like any common thief.

394
01:00:44,711 --> 01:00:47,202
Have the local magistrate
arrest and punish him.

395
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:52,347
Leave us.

396
01:01:02,862 --> 01:01:08,596
Wallace has already killed the magistrate
and taken control of the town.

397
01:01:08,801 --> 01:01:10,166
Stand up.

398
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,794
Stand up!

399
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:14,502
In the morning,

400
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:18,840
I depart for France to
press our rights there.

401
01:01:18,945 --> 01:01:21,846
And I leave you here to quell
this little rebellion.

402
01:01:21,948 --> 01:01:23,279
Understood?

403
01:01:23,383 --> 01:01:25,078
Is it?

404
01:01:28,054 --> 01:01:31,046
One day you will be a king.

405
01:01:32,025 --> 01:01:34,721
At least try to act like one.

406
01:01:38,498 --> 01:01:40,125
Get away from me.

407
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:42,862
Convene my military council.

408
01:01:53,613 --> 01:01:56,138

409
01:01:57,250 --> 01:01:59,377

410
01:02:00,186 --> 01:02:02,211

411
01:02:24,143 --> 01:02:25,440
There.

412
01:02:28,247 --> 01:02:29,339
After them.

413
01:02:57,043 --> 01:02:58,169
No point resisting.

414
01:02:58,277 --> 01:02:59,676
You're outnumbered and trapped.

415
01:03:00,179 --> 01:03:03,342
- Where are the rest of you?
- Where's Wallace?

416
01:03:15,461 --> 01:03:16,621
Father.

417
01:03:16,763 --> 01:03:18,424
Ah, come in. Come in.

418
01:03:19,532 --> 01:03:21,295
A rebellion has begun.

419
01:03:28,708 --> 01:03:29,766
Under whom?

420
01:03:29,876 --> 01:03:31,173
A commoner...

421
01:03:31,344 --> 01:03:33,437
named William Wallace.

422
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:46,656
You will embrace this rebellion.

423
01:03:46,759 --> 01:03:49,489
Support it from our lands in the North.

424
01:03:49,829 --> 01:03:54,266
I will gain English favor by
condemning it and ordering it

425
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,268
opposed from our lands in the South.

426
01:03:59,038 --> 01:04:02,303
Sit down. Stay awhile.

427
01:04:08,781 --> 01:04:13,650
This Wallace... He doesn't
even have a knighthood.

428
01:04:13,753 --> 01:04:16,381
But he fights with passion.

429
01:04:16,489 --> 01:04:18,457
And he inspires!

430
01:04:18,558 --> 01:04:21,755
And you wish to charge
off and fight as he did?

431
01:04:22,895 --> 01:04:24,590
So would I.

432
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,560
Well, maybe it's time.

433
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:29,962
It is time... to survive.

434
01:04:30,136 --> 01:04:32,934
You're the 17th Robert Bruce.

435
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:36,805
The 16 before you passed you land and title

436
01:04:36,909 --> 01:04:39,275
because they didn't charge in.

437
01:04:40,613 --> 01:04:42,103
Call a meeting of the nobles.

438
01:04:42,215 --> 01:04:43,546
They do nothing but talk.

439
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:45,810
Rightly so. They're as rich

440
01:04:45,918 --> 01:04:49,376
in English titles and lands as
they are in Scottish, as we are.

441
01:04:49,522 --> 01:04:52,355
You admire this man... this William Wallace.

442
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:55,552
Uncompromising men are easier to admire.

443
01:04:55,661 --> 01:04:57,788
He has courage. So does a dog.

444
01:04:57,997 --> 01:05:03,367
But it is exactly the ability to
compromise that makes a man noble.

445
01:05:03,703 --> 01:05:05,466
And understand this:

446
01:05:05,571 --> 01:05:10,440
Edward Longshanks is the most ruthless
king ever to sit on the throne of England.

447
01:05:10,877 --> 01:05:12,674
And none of us

448
01:05:12,778 --> 01:05:15,679
and nothing of Scotland will remain

449
01:05:15,781 --> 01:05:18,249
unless we are as ruthless.

450
01:05:18,985 --> 01:05:21,453
Give ear to our nobles.

451
01:05:22,021 --> 01:05:24,319
Knowing their minds

452
01:05:24,524 --> 01:05:26,924
is the key to the throne.

453
01:05:43,209 --> 01:05:44,870
Wait. Look.

454
01:05:46,512 --> 01:05:48,503
This is out and this is left.

455
01:05:48,981 --> 01:05:51,643
Carry on.

456
01:05:56,522 --> 01:06:00,014

457
01:06:00,459 --> 01:06:02,290

458
01:06:02,895 --> 01:06:06,160

459
01:06:06,265 --> 01:06:07,562

460
01:06:08,534 --> 01:06:12,129

461
01:06:12,238 --> 01:06:14,706

462
01:06:14,941 --> 01:06:16,101

463
01:06:16,209 --> 01:06:18,575

464
01:06:24,016 --> 01:06:25,608

465
01:06:25,918 --> 01:06:27,408

466
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,851

467
01:06:29,388 --> 01:06:32,289

468
01:06:32,391 --> 01:06:34,154

469
01:06:38,364 --> 01:06:39,661

470
01:06:40,299 --> 01:06:41,766

471
01:06:42,201 --> 01:06:43,600

472
01:06:45,004 --> 01:06:47,438

473
01:06:47,974 --> 01:06:50,807

474
01:06:51,143 --> 01:06:54,943

475
01:06:55,715 --> 01:06:58,548

476
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:04,353

477
01:07:05,825 --> 01:07:09,226

478
01:07:14,400 --> 01:07:16,334

479
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:18,764

480
01:07:21,374 --> 01:07:22,671

481
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:35,512
You know,

482
01:07:35,688 --> 01:07:39,021
Eventually, Longshanks will
send in his northern army.

483
01:07:39,158 --> 01:07:40,489
Heavy cavalry.

484
01:07:40,626 --> 01:07:41,957
Armored horse.

485
01:07:42,061 --> 01:07:43,460
Shake the very ground.

486
01:07:44,797 --> 01:07:46,424
He'll ride right over us.

487
01:07:46,632 --> 01:07:48,600
Uncle Argyle used to talk about it.

488
01:07:49,268 --> 01:07:52,362
How no army had ever stood up
to a charge of heavy horse.

489
01:07:52,571 --> 01:07:53,503
So what do we do?

490
01:07:53,606 --> 01:07:56,598
Hit. Run. Hide. The Highland way.

491
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:06,510
Or make spears.

492
01:08:07,219 --> 01:08:08,846
Hundreds of 'em.

493
01:08:08,954 --> 01:08:11,047
Long spears. Twice as long as a man.

494
01:08:11,657 --> 01:08:12,487
That long?

495
01:08:12,591 --> 01:08:13,956
Aye.

496
01:08:15,294 --> 01:08:17,091
Some men are longer than others.

497
01:08:17,263 --> 01:08:19,458
Your mother been telling
you stories about me again?

498
01:08:22,034 --> 01:08:23,831
Volunteers coming in.

499
01:08:27,273 --> 01:08:28,399
William Wallace.

500
01:08:28,641 --> 01:08:30,609
We've come to fight and to die for you.

501
01:08:31,210 --> 01:08:32,939
Stand up, man. I'm not the Pope.

502
01:08:34,113 --> 01:08:36,707
My name is Faudron. My sword is yours.

503
01:08:37,083 --> 01:08:38,209
I brought you this...

504
01:08:38,317 --> 01:08:39,841
We checked them for arms.

505
01:08:41,187 --> 01:08:42,654
I brought you this.

506
01:08:43,356 --> 01:08:45,187
My wife made it for you.

507
01:08:45,524 --> 01:08:46,718
Thank you.

508
01:08:51,063 --> 01:08:53,930
Him! That can't be William Wallace.

509
01:08:54,033 --> 01:08:56,092
I'm prettier than this man.

510
01:08:59,138 --> 01:09:01,606
All right, Father. I'll ask him.

511
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,470
If I risk my neck for you,

512
01:09:07,713 --> 01:09:09,704
will I get to kill Englishmen?

513
01:09:09,815 --> 01:09:11,510
Is your father a ghost

514
01:09:11,617 --> 01:09:13,414
or do you converse with the Almighty?

515
01:09:13,519 --> 01:09:16,613
To find his equal, an Irishman
is forced to talk to God.

516
01:09:16,722 --> 01:09:17,689
Yes, Father.

517
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:18,848
The Almighty says,

518
01:09:18,958 --> 01:09:21,620
"Just answer the fucking question!"

519
01:09:21,727 --> 01:09:22,751
Mind your tongue.

520
01:09:22,862 --> 01:09:24,056
lnsane Irish!

521
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:32,669
Smart enough to get a dagger
past your guards, old man.

522
01:09:32,772 --> 01:09:34,967
That's my friend, Irishman.

523
01:09:35,074 --> 01:09:37,235
And the answer to your question is yes.

524
01:09:37,343 --> 01:09:39,573
Fight for me, you get to kill the English.

525
01:09:40,146 --> 01:09:41,511
Excellent.

526
01:09:42,047 --> 01:09:43,344
Stephen is my name.

527
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:46,574
I'm the most wanted man on my island.

528
01:09:46,685 --> 01:09:49,119
Except I'm not on my island, of course.

529
01:09:49,355 --> 01:09:50,720
More's the pity.

530
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,051
Your island? You mean Ireland?

531
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:55,059
Yeah. It's mine.

532
01:09:59,298 --> 01:10:00,731
You're a madman.

533
01:10:08,307 --> 01:10:10,605
I've come to the right place, then.

534
01:11:30,956 --> 01:11:34,016
Sure, didn't the Almighty
send me to watch your back?

535
01:11:35,861 --> 01:11:37,726
I didn't like him anyway.

536
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:42,861
He wasn't right in the head.

537
01:11:55,981 --> 01:11:57,073
William.

538
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:58,547
It's our runners.

539
01:12:09,828 --> 01:12:11,090
The English...

540
01:12:11,196 --> 01:12:13,664
are advancing an army towards Stirling.

541
01:12:13,766 --> 01:12:14,790
Do the nobles rally?

542
01:12:14,900 --> 01:12:18,563
Robert the Bruce and others will not fight.

543
01:12:18,671 --> 01:12:19,831
But word has spread.

544
01:12:19,939 --> 01:12:22,499
- The Highlanders are coming down on their own.
- Aye...

545
01:12:22,741 --> 01:12:25,505
In droves of hundreds... and thousands!

546
01:12:25,678 --> 01:12:27,270
Are you ready for a war?

547
01:12:27,379 --> 01:12:29,244

548
01:12:30,249 --> 01:12:32,513

549
01:12:43,228 --> 01:12:44,252
What news?

550
01:12:44,363 --> 01:12:46,126
We're outnumbered, at least three to one.

551
01:12:46,231 --> 01:12:47,061
How many horse, then?

552
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,724
300, maybe more.

553
01:12:48,834 --> 01:12:50,301
300 heavy horse!

554
01:12:50,402 --> 01:12:51,960
We must try to negotiate.

555
01:12:52,071 --> 01:12:53,504
Who was in command?

556
01:12:53,606 --> 01:12:55,801
Did he have a scarlet chevron?

557
01:12:55,908 --> 01:12:57,507
- Aye, he did.
- That'll be Cheltham.

559
01:12:57,943 --> 01:13:00,104
We could still negotiate...

560
01:13:04,216 --> 01:13:05,444
What are they talking about?

561
01:13:06,552 --> 01:13:08,349
I cannae hear, but it doesnae look good.

562
01:13:09,254 --> 01:13:10,744
The nobles will negotiate.

563
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:12,483
They do a deal...

564
01:13:13,058 --> 01:13:14,355
and we go home.

565
01:13:14,727 --> 01:13:16,319
If not...

566
01:13:16,428 --> 01:13:17,258
we charge.

567
01:13:17,529 --> 01:13:19,690
300 heavy horse. We've no chance.

568
01:14:19,258 --> 01:14:20,350
So many.

569
01:14:25,664 --> 01:14:28,531
I didn't come here to fight
so they could own more lands.

570
01:14:28,701 --> 01:14:29,963
Then I'd have to work for them.

571
01:14:31,036 --> 01:14:32,162
Nor me.

572
01:14:33,706 --> 01:14:35,264
All right, lads.

573
01:14:35,574 --> 01:14:37,701
I'm not dying for these bastards.

574
01:14:37,910 --> 01:14:39,741
Let's go home.

575
01:14:57,129 --> 01:14:59,120
Stop, men!

576
01:14:59,231 --> 01:15:00,698
Do not flee.

577
01:15:00,799 --> 01:15:03,393
Wait until we've negotiated.

578
01:15:56,655 --> 01:15:57,883
William Wallace!

579
01:15:57,990 --> 01:16:00,185
Can't be. Not tall enough.

580
01:16:21,180 --> 01:16:24,308
The Almighty says this
is a fashionable fight.

581
01:16:24,416 --> 01:16:25,576
It's drawn the finest people.

582
01:16:25,684 --> 01:16:27,015
Where is thy salute?

583
01:16:27,252 --> 01:16:29,880
For coming to this battlefield,

584
01:16:30,122 --> 01:16:31,214
I thank you.

585
01:16:31,323 --> 01:16:34,224
This is our army. To join
it, you give homage.

586
01:16:34,326 --> 01:16:36,021
I give homage to Scotland.

587
01:16:37,396 --> 01:16:39,387
And if this is your army,

588
01:16:40,666 --> 01:16:42,258
why does it go?

589
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:44,835
We didn't come here to fight for them.

590
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:49,666
Home.

591
01:16:49,775 --> 01:16:51,174
The English are too many.

592
01:17:00,152 --> 01:17:02,211
Sons of Scotland!

593
01:17:02,855 --> 01:17:04,618
I am William Wallace!

594
01:17:04,823 --> 01:17:06,757
William Wallace is seven feet tall.

595
01:17:06,925 --> 01:17:08,449
Yes, I've heard.

596
01:17:09,294 --> 01:17:11,159
He kills men by the hundred.

597
01:17:11,496 --> 01:17:13,123
And if he were here,

598
01:17:13,232 --> 01:17:16,201
he'd consume the English
with fireballs from his eyes

599
01:17:16,301 --> 01:17:18,132
and lightning from his arse.

600
01:17:21,807 --> 01:17:23,365
I am William Wallace!

601
01:17:25,310 --> 01:17:27,039
And I see

602
01:17:27,145 --> 01:17:30,012
a whole army of my countrymen

603
01:17:30,115 --> 01:17:32,345
here in defiance of tyranny.

604
01:17:35,621 --> 01:17:38,249
You've come to fight as free men

605
01:17:40,359 --> 01:17:42,122
and free men you are!

606
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,721
What will you do without freedom?

607
01:17:49,902 --> 01:17:51,802
Will you fight?

608
01:17:55,407 --> 01:17:56,271
Against that?

609
01:17:56,375 --> 01:17:58,104
No. We will run,

610
01:17:58,944 --> 01:18:00,104
and we will live.

611
01:18:00,779 --> 01:18:01,871
Aye.

612
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:03,572
Fight and you may die.

613
01:18:04,049 --> 01:18:06,017
Run, and you'll live.

614
01:18:06,985 --> 01:18:08,543
At least a while.

615
01:18:12,090 --> 01:18:16,117
And dying in your beds, many years from now,

616
01:18:16,595 --> 01:18:18,119
would you be willing

617
01:18:18,230 --> 01:18:21,927
to trade all the days from this day to that

618
01:18:22,034 --> 01:18:23,331
for one chance,

619
01:18:23,435 --> 01:18:24,993
just one chance,

620
01:18:25,103 --> 01:18:26,536
to come back here

621
01:18:26,638 --> 01:18:28,902
and tell our enemies

622
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:31,100
that they may take our lives

623
01:18:31,276 --> 01:18:32,937
but they'll never take

624
01:18:33,045 --> 01:18:34,945
our freedom!

625
01:19:01,707 --> 01:19:03,698
They seem quite optimistic.

626
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:05,001
Maybe they do want to fight.

627
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:08,170
Confrontation might be a foregone conclusion.

628
01:19:08,847 --> 01:19:10,439
Nonetheless,

629
01:19:10,549 --> 01:19:11,914
we should deliver the King's terms.

630
01:19:12,017 --> 01:19:13,075
The King's terms?

631
01:19:13,185 --> 01:19:14,618
They'll never live up to them.

632
01:19:15,287 --> 01:19:16,845
My Lord, I think...

633
01:19:16,955 --> 01:19:19,719
All right. Offer them the terms.

634
01:19:23,095 --> 01:19:24,756
They're coming out. Should we go to them?

635
01:19:24,863 --> 01:19:27,457
- Let me do the talking. Agreed?
- Aye.

636
01:19:33,505 --> 01:19:35,063
Fine speech.

637
01:19:35,874 --> 01:19:37,466
Now what do we do?

638
01:19:39,044 --> 01:19:41,035
Just be yourselves.

639
01:19:41,680 --> 01:19:43,011
Where are you going?

640
01:19:43,248 --> 01:19:44,875
I'm going to pick a fight.

641
01:19:53,525 --> 01:19:55,516
We didn't get dressed up for nothing.

642
01:19:57,829 --> 01:19:59,820
Mornay, Lochlan, Craig.

643
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,801
Here are the King's terms.

644
01:20:07,205 --> 01:20:10,663
Lead this army off the field

645
01:20:14,479 --> 01:20:18,677
and he will give you each
estates in Yorkshire

646
01:20:18,784 --> 01:20:20,911
including hereditary title,

647
01:20:21,219 --> 01:20:23,380
from which you will pay...

648
01:20:23,688 --> 01:20:25,656
From which you will pay...

649
01:20:25,757 --> 01:20:28,555
- I have an offer for ye.
- Cheltham,

650
01:20:28,660 --> 01:20:30,389
this is William Wallace.

651
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,625
From which you will pay the King...

652
01:20:33,732 --> 01:20:35,461
I said I have an offer.

653
01:20:35,567 --> 01:20:37,034
You disrespect a banner of truce.

654
01:20:37,135 --> 01:20:39,433
From his King? Absolutely.

655
01:20:40,205 --> 01:20:42,264
Here are Scotland's terms.

656
01:20:42,841 --> 01:20:44,536
Lower your flags

657
01:20:44,643 --> 01:20:46,508
and march straight back to England.

658
01:20:46,611 --> 01:20:49,239
At every home you pass, beg forgiveness

659
01:20:49,347 --> 01:20:52,373
for 100 years of theft, rape and murder.

660
01:20:52,684 --> 01:20:55,050
Do that, and your men shall live.

661
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:57,010
Do it not

662
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:59,316
and every one of you will die today.

663
01:21:05,764 --> 01:21:07,629
You are outmatched.

664
01:21:07,899 --> 01:21:09,992
You have no heavy cavalry.

665
01:21:10,102 --> 01:21:12,127
In two centuries, no army has won without....

666
01:21:12,237 --> 01:21:14,330
I'm not finished!

667
01:21:16,041 --> 01:21:18,509
Before we let you leave

668
01:21:18,677 --> 01:21:21,305
your commander must cross that field,

669
01:21:21,413 --> 01:21:23,574
present himself before this army,

670
01:21:23,682 --> 01:21:27,812
put his head between his
legs and kiss his own arse.

671
01:21:38,163 --> 01:21:40,757
That was less cordial than he was used to.

672
01:21:40,866 --> 01:21:43,027
You be ready and do exactly as I say.

673
01:21:43,135 --> 01:21:44,227
On my signal

674
01:21:44,336 --> 01:21:45,769
ride round behind our position,

675
01:21:45,871 --> 01:21:47,429
and flank them.

676
01:21:47,572 --> 01:21:48,834
We must not divide our forces.

677
01:21:48,940 --> 01:21:50,464
Do it...

678
01:21:50,675 --> 01:21:52,700
and let the English see you do it.

679
01:21:53,044 --> 01:21:54,602
They'll think we run away?

680
01:21:55,413 --> 01:21:56,971
Take out their archers

681
01:21:57,082 --> 01:21:58,276
and meet in the middle.

682
01:21:58,383 --> 01:21:59,680
Right. Come on.

683
01:22:24,242 --> 01:22:26,039
lnsolent bastard.

684
01:22:26,211 --> 01:22:28,475
I want this Wallace's heart on a plate!

685
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,411
Archers.

686
01:22:38,990 --> 01:22:42,187
Archers forward.

687
01:23:38,850 --> 01:23:40,147
You bastards.

688
01:24:15,253 --> 01:24:16,481
Loose.

689
01:24:36,541 --> 01:24:39,169
The Lord tells me He can
get me out of this mess

690
01:24:39,277 --> 01:24:41,245
but He's pretty sure you're fucked.

691
01:25:02,233 --> 01:25:03,530
Ready...

692
01:25:03,635 --> 01:25:05,034
- Loose.
- Ride.

693
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:31,386
See? Every Scot with a horse is fleeing.

694
01:25:31,496 --> 01:25:33,794
Our cavalry will ride them down like grass.

695
01:25:34,399 --> 01:25:35,593
Send the horse.

696
01:25:35,934 --> 01:25:37,026
Full attack.

697
01:26:52,076 --> 01:26:53,065
Steady...

698
01:26:55,113 --> 01:26:56,375
Hold.

699
01:26:58,550 --> 01:26:59,915
Hold.

700
01:27:04,656 --> 01:27:05,884
Hold.

701
01:27:10,628 --> 01:27:11,788
Hold.

702
01:27:23,808 --> 01:27:26,675
Now!

703
01:28:11,990 --> 01:28:13,252
Send the infantry.

704
01:28:13,358 --> 01:28:14,382
My Lord...

705
01:28:14,492 --> 01:28:15,789
You lead them.

706
01:28:29,107 --> 01:28:32,008
Charge.

707
01:30:35,233 --> 01:30:36,359
Retreat.

708
01:31:11,235 --> 01:31:13,569
Bastard.

709
01:31:14,138 --> 01:31:16,333
Come on.

710
01:31:56,747 --> 01:31:58,374
All right.

711
01:32:28,045 --> 01:32:34,814
Wallace.

712
01:32:35,486 --> 01:32:37,818
Wallace.

713
01:33:10,788 --> 01:33:14,815
I knight thee Sir William Wallace.

714
01:33:18,396 --> 01:33:19,727
Sir William,

715
01:33:20,031 --> 01:33:21,089
in the name of God

716
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:24,498
we appoint thee guardian and
high protector of Scotland

717
01:33:24,602 --> 01:33:26,934
and thy captains as aides-de-camp.

718
01:33:27,705 --> 01:33:29,798
Stand and be recognized.

719
01:33:41,919 --> 01:33:43,682
Does anyone know his politics?

720
01:33:43,821 --> 01:33:45,311
No, but his weight with

721
01:33:45,423 --> 01:33:47,152
the commoners could upset everything.

722
01:33:47,525 --> 01:33:49,493
The Balliols will kiss his arse,

723
01:33:49,594 --> 01:33:50,686
and so we must.

724
01:33:58,803 --> 01:33:59,861
Sir William.

725
01:34:04,508 --> 01:34:06,032

726
01:34:06,444 --> 01:34:13,441
lnasmuch as you and your captains hail from a
region long known to support the Balliol clan,

727
01:34:13,551 --> 01:34:17,351
may we invite you to continue your support

728
01:34:17,455 --> 01:34:19,355
and uphold our rightful claim?

729
01:34:19,457 --> 01:34:21,550
Damn the Balliol clan.

730
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:23,820
They're all Longshanks's men.

731
01:34:24,128 --> 01:34:25,618
Gentlemen.

732
01:34:27,465 --> 01:34:29,865
- Gentlemen.
- It's time to declare a king.

733
01:34:30,001 --> 01:34:31,127
Halt. Wait.

734
01:34:31,235 --> 01:34:34,204
Are you prepared to recognize
our legitimate succession?

735
01:34:34,305 --> 01:34:36,068
You won't support the claim.

736
01:34:36,173 --> 01:34:38,038
Those were lies, written by you.

737
01:34:38,142 --> 01:34:39,575
Oh, no.

738
01:34:40,311 --> 01:34:41,903
I demand recognition of these documents.

739
01:34:42,013 --> 01:34:44,914
These were lies when you wrote them.

740
01:34:47,518 --> 01:34:50,487
Please, gentlemen.

741
01:34:50,955 --> 01:34:53,446
Quiet. Sir William. Where are you going?

742
01:34:55,927 --> 01:34:57,690
We have beaten the English.

743
01:34:58,162 --> 01:34:59,789
But they'll come back

744
01:35:00,531 --> 01:35:02,499
because you won't stand together.

745
01:35:03,334 --> 01:35:04,460
What will you do?

746
01:35:04,568 --> 01:35:06,433
I will invade England

747
01:35:06,604 --> 01:35:08,697
and defeat the English on their own ground.

748
01:35:11,642 --> 01:35:13,803
lnvade? That's impossible.

749
01:35:13,911 --> 01:35:15,105
Why?

750
01:35:15,346 --> 01:35:16,836
Why is that impossible?

751
01:35:17,515 --> 01:35:22,350
You're so concerned with squabbling
for the scraps from Longshanks's table

752
01:35:22,553 --> 01:35:25,920
that you've missed your God-given
right to something better.

753
01:35:26,691 --> 01:35:28,818
There's a difference between us.

754
01:35:29,126 --> 01:35:31,151
You think the people of Scotland exist

755
01:35:31,262 --> 01:35:33,196
to provide you with position.

756
01:35:33,631 --> 01:35:35,462
I think your position exists

757
01:35:35,566 --> 01:35:37,591
to provide those people with freedom.

758
01:35:38,936 --> 01:35:41,666
And I go to make sure that they have it.

759
01:35:54,785 --> 01:35:56,514
Wait.

760
01:35:59,690 --> 01:36:01,282
I respect what you said.

761
01:36:01,392 --> 01:36:04,589
But remember that these
men have lands and castles.

762
01:36:05,296 --> 01:36:06,593
It's much to risk.

763
01:36:06,697 --> 01:36:08,790
And the common man that bleeds in battle,

764
01:36:08,899 --> 01:36:10,366
does he risk less?

765
01:36:15,306 --> 01:36:16,739
No.

766
01:36:16,907 --> 01:36:20,434
But from top to bottom, this
country has got no sense of itself.

767
01:36:20,544 --> 01:36:23,707
lts nobles share allegiance with England.

768
01:36:23,814 --> 01:36:25,179
lts clans war with each other.

769
01:36:25,282 --> 01:36:26,476
Aye.

770
01:36:28,152 --> 01:36:32,179
If you make enemies on both sides
of the border, you'll end up dead.

771
01:36:32,289 --> 01:36:34,814
We all will. It's a question of how and why.

772
01:36:34,925 --> 01:36:37,257
I'm not a coward. I want what you want.

773
01:36:37,361 --> 01:36:39,056
But we need the nobles.

774
01:36:39,163 --> 01:36:40,790
- We need 'em?
- Aye.

775
01:36:40,898 --> 01:36:42,058

776
01:36:43,334 --> 01:36:45,825
What does that mean, to be noble?

777
01:36:46,070 --> 01:36:48,868
Your title gives you claim
to Scotland's throne,

778
01:36:49,073 --> 01:36:50,665
but men don't follow titles.

779
01:36:51,409 --> 01:36:53,070
They follow courage.

780
01:36:53,244 --> 01:36:55,144
Our people know you.

781
01:36:55,246 --> 01:36:56,907
Noble and common, they respect you.

782
01:36:57,014 --> 01:37:01,041
And if you would just lead them to freedom...

783
01:37:02,987 --> 01:37:05,012
they'd follow you.

784
01:37:06,724 --> 01:37:08,385
And so would I.

785
01:37:30,214 --> 01:37:31,272
Damn it.

786
01:37:31,715 --> 01:37:35,173
My sodomite cousin the Prince tells
me he has no troops to lend.

787
01:37:35,286 --> 01:37:37,277
Every town in northern
England is begging for help.

788
01:37:39,890 --> 01:37:40,788
He advances.

789
01:37:40,891 --> 01:37:42,688
- To which town?
- To here, my Lord.

790
01:37:43,894 --> 01:37:45,623
Bring the provisions inside,

791
01:37:45,729 --> 01:37:47,856
double the guards, seal the gate. Now.

792
01:37:49,233 --> 01:37:50,894
Quickly. Bring in the provisions. 

793
01:38:21,465 --> 01:38:23,899
Sir, we can get you out if you leave now.

794
01:38:24,001 --> 01:38:25,662
I will not tell my uncle

795
01:38:25,769 --> 01:38:27,669
I've lost him the greatest city in the North.

796
01:39:08,979 --> 01:39:10,446
Come on.

797
01:39:45,115 --> 01:39:47,208
Make way for the King.

798
01:39:56,493 --> 01:39:57,858
It's not your fault.

799
01:39:59,296 --> 01:40:00,285
Stand up to him.

800
01:40:00,397 --> 01:40:02,592
I will stand up to him and more.

801
01:40:41,038 --> 01:40:42,437
What news of the North?

802
01:40:44,375 --> 01:40:48,471
Nothing new, Your Majesty. We've
sent riders to speed any word.

803
01:40:48,579 --> 01:40:54,074
I heard the word in France where I was
fighting to expand your future kingdom.

804
01:40:54,418 --> 01:41:00,379
The word, my son, is that our entire
northern army is annihilated.

805
01:41:01,225 --> 01:41:03,420
And you have done nothing.

806
01:41:04,662 --> 01:41:08,428
I... have ordered conscription,
sir, assembled and ready to depart.

807
01:41:10,734 --> 01:41:13,703
Excuse me, sire, but there's a
very urgent message from York.

808
01:41:14,171 --> 01:41:15,195
Come.

809
01:41:23,814 --> 01:41:24,473
Leave us.

810
01:41:24,581 --> 01:41:25,639
Thank you, sire.

811
01:41:29,219 --> 01:41:31,813
Wallace has sacked York.

812
01:41:31,922 --> 01:41:33,753
- What?
- Wallace has sacked York.

813
01:41:50,307 --> 01:41:52,172
Sire...

814
01:41:52,276 --> 01:41:53,800
thy own nephew.

815
01:41:54,345 --> 01:41:56,540
What beast could do such a thing.

816
01:41:58,248 --> 01:42:00,478
If he can sack York

817
01:42:02,886 --> 01:42:04,911
he can invade Lower England.

818
01:42:05,022 --> 01:42:06,489
We will stop him.

819
01:42:09,259 --> 01:42:11,056
Who is this person

820
01:42:11,161 --> 01:42:14,187
who speaks to me as though
I needed his advice?

821
01:42:15,833 --> 01:42:18,267
I have declared Phillip my High Counsellor.

822
01:42:18,369 --> 01:42:19,961
Is he qualified?

823
01:42:20,070 --> 01:42:25,007
I am skilled in the arts of
war and military tactics, sire.

824
01:42:25,175 --> 01:42:26,938
Are you?

825
01:42:27,711 --> 01:42:28,871
Tell me...

826
01:42:29,079 --> 01:42:33,482
What advice would you offer on the present...

827
01:42:33,584 --> 01:42:35,484
situation?

828
01:43:05,783 --> 01:43:08,251
I shall offer a truce

829
01:43:09,186 --> 01:43:11,017
and buy him off.

830
01:43:13,023 --> 01:43:14,581
But who will go to him?

831
01:43:15,058 --> 01:43:16,616
Not I.

832
01:43:17,094 --> 01:43:19,858
If I fell under the sword of that murderer

833
01:43:19,963 --> 01:43:24,127
it might be my head in a basket.

834
01:43:24,301 --> 01:43:28,169
And not... my gentle son.

835
01:43:28,272 --> 01:43:33,073
The mere sight of him would only encourage
an enemy to take over the whole country.

836
01:43:35,979 --> 01:43:38,413
So whom do I send?

837
01:43:39,917 --> 01:43:44,183
Whom do I send?

838
01:45:07,537 --> 01:45:09,471
I'm dreaming.

839
01:45:09,572 --> 01:45:11,301
Yes, you are.

840
01:45:12,842 --> 01:45:14,434
And you must wake.

841
01:45:23,486 --> 01:45:25,317
I don't want to wake.

842
01:45:26,990 --> 01:45:29,254
I want to stay here with you.

843
01:45:30,360 --> 01:45:32,191
And I with you.

844
01:45:33,229 --> 01:45:34,856
But you must wake now.

845
01:45:38,268 --> 01:45:39,997
Wake up, William.

846
01:45:40,737 --> 01:45:42,102
Wake up.

847
01:45:44,173 --> 01:45:46,334
William, wake up...

848
01:45:46,809 --> 01:45:50,245
William. A royal entourage comes

849
01:45:50,346 --> 01:45:52,143
flying banners of truce

850
01:45:52,248 --> 01:45:54,478
and the standards of Longshanks himself.

851
01:46:38,695 --> 01:46:40,526
I am the Princess of Wales.

852
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:43,861
I come as the King's servant
and with his authority.

853
01:46:44,667 --> 01:46:46,259
To do what?

854
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:49,263
To discuss the King's proposals.

855
01:46:51,441 --> 01:46:53,568
Will you speak with a woman?

856
01:47:14,197 --> 01:47:17,166
I hear you have been
given the rank of knight.

857
01:47:17,266 --> 01:47:19,063
I have been given nothing.

858
01:47:19,602 --> 01:47:21,593
God makes men what they are.

859
01:47:22,472 --> 01:47:25,407
God made you the sacker of peaceful cities?

860
01:47:25,575 --> 01:47:28,976
The executioner of the King's
nephew, my husband's own cousin?

861
01:47:30,113 --> 01:47:34,106
York was the staging point for
every invasion of my country.

862
01:47:35,084 --> 01:47:37,678
That cousin hanged innocent Scots, even women

863
01:47:37,787 --> 01:47:39,687
and children, from the city walls.

864
01:47:43,359 --> 01:47:46,590
Longshanks did far worse the last
time he took a Scottish city.

865
01:47:48,498 --> 01:47:51,228

866
01:47:51,334 --> 01:47:53,268

867
01:47:53,369 --> 01:47:55,735

868
01:47:58,040 --> 01:48:00,770

869
01:48:03,045 --> 01:48:05,673

870
01:48:07,216 --> 01:48:11,550
You ask your King... to his face. Ask him.

871
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:16,556
See if his eyes can
convince you of the truth.

872
01:48:24,400 --> 01:48:27,198
Hamilton... Leave us.

873
01:48:28,638 --> 01:48:29,400
My Lady?

874
01:48:29,505 --> 01:48:31,666
Leave us. Now.

875
01:48:42,985 --> 01:48:44,885
Let us talk plainly.

876
01:48:45,121 --> 01:48:47,055
You invade England.

877
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:51,793
But you cannot complete the conquest
so far from your shelter and supply.

878
01:48:53,095 --> 01:48:55,029
The King desires peace.

879
01:48:55,998 --> 01:48:57,625
Longshanks desires peace?

880
01:48:57,733 --> 01:48:59,928
He declares it to me, I swear it.

881
01:49:00,269 --> 01:49:02,533
He proposes that you withdraw your attack.

882
01:49:02,805 --> 01:49:06,297
In return he grants you
title, estates and this

883
01:49:06,409 --> 01:49:09,003
chest of gold which I am
to pay to you personally.

884
01:49:09,979 --> 01:49:13,142
A lordship and titles, gold...

885
01:49:13,249 --> 01:49:14,807
that I should become Judas.

886
01:49:14,917 --> 01:49:16,282
Peace is made in such ways.

887
01:49:16,385 --> 01:49:18,410
Slaves are made in such ways.

888
01:49:21,557 --> 01:49:24,822
The last time Longshanks
spoke of peace, I was a boy.

889
01:49:25,294 --> 01:49:29,230
Many Scottish nobles who would
not be slaves, were lured by him,

890
01:49:29,332 --> 01:49:31,800
under a flag of truce, to a barn...

891
01:49:31,968 --> 01:49:34,732
where he had them hanged.

892
01:49:34,937 --> 01:49:37,167
I was very young,

893
01:49:37,273 --> 01:49:40,765
but I remember Longshanks's notion of peace.

894
01:49:43,946 --> 01:49:46,346
I understand you have suffered.

895
01:49:47,483 --> 01:49:49,075
I know...

896
01:49:49,285 --> 01:49:51,344
about your woman.

897
01:50:01,531 --> 01:50:02,998
She was my wife.

898
01:50:06,068 --> 01:50:07,501
We married in secret because

899
01:50:07,603 --> 01:50:10,197
I would not share her with an English lord.

900
01:50:11,774 --> 01:50:15,039
They killed her... to get to me.

901
01:50:20,016 --> 01:50:22,382
I've never spoken of it.

902
01:50:23,719 --> 01:50:27,485
I don't know why I tell you now, except...

903
01:50:29,725 --> 01:50:32,956
I see her strength in you.

904
01:50:37,733 --> 01:50:40,702
One day, you'll be a queen.

905
01:50:42,705 --> 01:50:45,572
And you must open your eyes.

906
01:50:51,948 --> 01:50:53,677
You tell your King

907
01:50:54,517 --> 01:50:56,542
that William Wallace will not be ruled

908
01:50:57,553 --> 01:51:00,044
and nor will any Scot while I live.

909
01:51:32,888 --> 01:51:38,383
My son's loyal wife returns
unkilled by the heathen.

910
01:51:38,494 --> 01:51:39,722
So he accepted our bribe?

911
01:51:39,829 --> 01:51:42,093
No. He did not.

912
01:51:43,265 --> 01:51:45,130
Then why does he stay?

913
01:51:45,301 --> 01:51:48,361
My scouts tell me that he has not advanced.

914
01:51:48,471 --> 01:51:50,200
He waits for you at York.

915
01:51:50,539 --> 01:51:53,406
He says he will attack no more towns

916
01:51:53,576 --> 01:51:56,272
if you are man enough to come and face him.

917
01:51:56,379 --> 01:51:58,176
Did he?

918
01:51:58,681 --> 01:52:02,913
The Welsh bowmen will not be detected

919
01:52:03,019 --> 01:52:07,251
arriving so far around his flank.

920
01:52:07,456 --> 01:52:11,392
The main force of our armies
from France land here

921
01:52:11,494 --> 01:52:14,554
to the north of Edinburgh. Conscripts from

922
01:52:14,664 --> 01:52:19,431
Ireland will approach from
the southwest to here.

923
01:52:19,602 --> 01:52:20,830
Welsh bowmen,

924
01:52:20,936 --> 01:52:23,336
troops from France, Irish conscripts.

925
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:26,567
But they'd take weeks to assemble.

926
01:52:26,776 --> 01:52:29,074
I dispatched them...

927
01:52:29,178 --> 01:52:31,578
before I sent your wife.

928
01:52:35,017 --> 01:52:37,645
So our little ruse succeeded.

929
01:52:37,753 --> 01:52:39,414
Thank you.

930
01:52:39,655 --> 01:52:43,591
And while this upstart
awaits my arrival in York,

931
01:52:43,693 --> 01:52:48,596
my forces will have arrived
in Edinburgh, behind him.

932
01:52:48,864 --> 01:52:52,322
You spoke with this...

933
01:52:52,435 --> 01:52:54,266
Wallace

934
01:52:54,370 --> 01:52:56,031
in private?

935
01:52:56,138 --> 01:52:57,765
Tell me...

936
01:52:59,275 --> 01:53:01,869
What kind of man is he?

937
01:53:02,578 --> 01:53:05,046
A mindless barbarian.

938
01:53:05,781 --> 01:53:08,841
Not a king like you, my Lord.

939
01:53:10,152 --> 01:53:13,212
You may return to your embroidery.

940
01:53:13,322 --> 01:53:15,222
Humbly, my Lord.

941
01:53:15,458 --> 01:53:18,552
You brought back the money?

942
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:23,227
No.

943
01:53:23,499 --> 01:53:26,866
I gave it to ease the suffering
of the children of this war.

944
01:53:28,537 --> 01:53:32,337
That's what happens when you send a woman.

945
01:53:33,109 --> 01:53:34,872
Forgive me, sire.

946
01:53:34,977 --> 01:53:36,774
I thought that generosity might

947
01:53:36,879 --> 01:53:41,816
demonstrate your greatness
to those you mean to rule.

948
01:53:43,819 --> 01:53:46,413
My greatness

949
01:53:46,522 --> 01:53:50,481
will be better demonstrated when
Wallace returns to Scotland

950
01:53:50,659 --> 01:53:53,719
and finds his country in ashes.

951
01:53:57,633 --> 01:53:59,157
William.

952
01:53:59,435 --> 01:54:03,371
There's riders approaching.

953
01:54:08,477 --> 01:54:11,310
A personal escort of the Princess.

954
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:12,913
Aye.

955
01:54:13,783 --> 01:54:16,377
Must have made an impression.

956
01:54:16,852 --> 01:54:18,012
Aye.

957
01:54:18,387 --> 01:54:20,378
I didn't think you were
in the tent that long.

958
01:54:24,860 --> 01:54:26,191

959
01:54:27,496 --> 01:54:29,396

960
01:54:30,332 --> 01:54:31,822

961
01:54:56,325 --> 01:54:57,519
It's true.

962
01:54:57,626 --> 01:54:59,355
The English ships are coming from the South.

963
01:54:59,461 --> 01:55:00,826
I don't know about the Welsh yet,

964
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:02,454
but the Irish have landed.

965
01:55:02,698 --> 01:55:05,326
I had to see it myself to believe it.

966
01:55:05,768 --> 01:55:07,963
Why are the Irish fighting with the English?

967
01:55:08,070 --> 01:55:09,901
I wouldn't worry about them.

968
01:55:10,005 --> 01:55:11,632
Didn't I tell you before?

969
01:55:12,041 --> 01:55:14,100
It's my island.

970
01:55:14,210 --> 01:55:15,268
Hamish,

971
01:55:15,377 --> 01:55:17,675
ride ahead to Edinburgh
and assemble the council.

972
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:19,872
- Order it.
- Right. Come on.

973
01:55:23,853 --> 01:55:24,911
Your island?

974
01:55:25,020 --> 01:55:26,647
My island. Yup.

975
01:55:29,792 --> 01:55:31,384
Please, gentlemen.

976
01:55:31,493 --> 01:55:34,053
Lords, Craig is right.

977
01:55:34,163 --> 01:55:36,654
This time our only option is to negotiate.

978
01:55:36,999 --> 01:55:40,059
Unless you want to see Edinburgh razed...

979
01:55:46,976 --> 01:55:49,911
My army has marched for many days.

980
01:55:50,279 --> 01:55:53,771
And we still have preparations to
make, so I'll make this plain.

981
01:55:55,551 --> 01:55:57,985
We require every soldier you can summon,

982
01:55:58,087 --> 01:56:01,523
your personal escorts, even yourselves.

983
01:56:01,790 --> 01:56:03,724
And we need them now.

984
01:56:04,760 --> 01:56:08,252
With such a force arrayed against us,
it's time to discuss other options.

985
01:56:08,364 --> 01:56:10,093
Other options?

986
01:56:11,367 --> 01:56:15,633
Don't you wish at least to
lead your men onto the field

987
01:56:15,738 --> 01:56:19,538
and barter a better deal with
Longshanks before you run?

988
01:56:19,642 --> 01:56:20,404
Sir William...

989
01:56:20,509 --> 01:56:21,601
We cannot defeat them.

990
01:56:21,710 --> 01:56:22,699
- We can.
- Sir William.

991
01:56:22,811 --> 01:56:24,506
And we will.

992
01:56:26,982 --> 01:56:28,711
We won at Stirling,

993
01:56:28,817 --> 01:56:30,580
and still you quibble.

994
01:56:31,553 --> 01:56:33,646
We won at York and you would not support us.

995
01:56:35,057 --> 01:56:38,549
If you'll no stand up with us
now, I'd say you're cowards.

996
01:56:44,566 --> 01:56:46,500
If you are Scotsmen,

997
01:56:46,635 --> 01:56:49,195
I'm ashamed to call myself one.

998
01:56:49,338 --> 01:56:51,499
Please, Sir William, speak with me alone.

999
01:56:54,143 --> 01:56:55,872
I beg you.

1000
01:56:59,181 --> 01:57:01,308
You've achieved so much,

1001
01:57:01,717 --> 01:57:04,379
but fighting these odds, it looks like rage,

1002
01:57:04,486 --> 01:57:05,475
not courage.

1003
01:57:05,587 --> 01:57:07,521
It's well beyond rage.

1004
01:57:09,658 --> 01:57:11,592
Help me.

1005
01:57:12,728 --> 01:57:15,891
In the name of Christ, help yourselves.

1006
01:57:16,065 --> 01:57:18,192
Now is our chance. Now.

1007
01:57:18,767 --> 01:57:20,428
If we join, we can win.

1008
01:57:20,536 --> 01:57:23,903
If we win, we'll have what none
of us have ever had before.

1009
01:57:25,274 --> 01:57:27,504
A country of our own.

1010
01:57:28,978 --> 01:57:31,173
You're the rightful leader

1011
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:33,805
and there is strength in you, I see it.

1012
01:57:39,054 --> 01:57:40,783
Unite us.

1013
01:57:43,592 --> 01:57:46,720
Unite us. Unite the clans.

1014
01:57:53,302 --> 01:57:55,293
- All right.
- Right.

1015
01:58:01,310 --> 01:58:03,141
This cannot be the way.

1016
01:58:03,612 --> 01:58:05,546
You said yourself

1017
01:58:05,647 --> 01:58:08,707
the nobles will not support Wallace.

1018
01:58:09,985 --> 01:58:14,046
So how does it help us to join
the side that is slaughtered?

1019
01:58:15,057 --> 01:58:17,048
I gave him my word.

1020
01:58:25,367 --> 01:58:27,358
I know it is hard.

1021
01:58:28,003 --> 01:58:31,234
Being a leader is.

1022
01:58:31,340 --> 01:58:32,830
My son...

1023
01:58:33,609 --> 01:58:35,372
Son...

1024
01:58:35,544 --> 01:58:37,205
Look at me.

1025
01:58:43,752 --> 01:58:45,811
I cannot be King.

1026
01:58:46,388 --> 01:58:49,551
You and you alone can rule Scotland.

1027
01:58:50,025 --> 01:58:52,459
What I tell you, you must do.

1028
01:58:52,761 --> 01:58:55,229
Not for me, not for yourself,

1029
01:58:55,497 --> 01:58:57,658
but for your country.

1030
01:58:59,701 --> 01:59:02,169

1031
01:59:13,715 --> 01:59:15,012
Right, lads, make way.

1032
01:59:15,284 --> 01:59:16,376
Coming through.

1033
01:59:23,325 --> 01:59:24,815
Make way, lads.

1034
01:59:30,466 --> 01:59:32,525
The Bruce is not coming, William.

1035
01:59:33,402 --> 01:59:34,767
He'll come.

1036
01:59:36,238 --> 01:59:38,001
Mornay and Lochlan have come.

1037
01:59:40,375 --> 01:59:41,706
So will the Bruce.

1038
01:59:45,481 --> 01:59:49,076
Quite a lovely... gathering.

1039
01:59:50,219 --> 01:59:51,743
Wouldn't you agree?

1040
01:59:55,491 --> 01:59:57,118
The archers are ready, sire.

1041
01:59:57,259 --> 01:59:58,988
Not the archers.

1042
01:59:59,094 --> 02:00:02,257
My scouts say their archers
are miles away and no threat.

1043
02:00:02,464 --> 02:00:03,692
Arrows cost money.

1044
02:00:03,799 --> 02:00:05,426
Use up the Irish.

1045
02:00:05,534 --> 02:00:06,558
The dead cost nothing.

1046
02:00:06,802 --> 02:00:09,236
And send in the infantry and cavalry.

1047
02:00:09,805 --> 02:00:11,329
lnfantry.

1048
02:00:13,175 --> 02:00:16,440
Cavalry.

1049
02:00:18,347 --> 02:00:19,974
Advance.

1050
02:01:46,301 --> 02:01:48,792
Good to see ye this morning.

1051
02:01:51,139 --> 02:01:52,731
Irish!

1052
02:01:53,108 --> 02:01:54,439
Glad to have ye with us.

1053
02:01:54,676 --> 02:01:55,574
Watch this.

1054
02:04:06,908 --> 02:04:08,933
Mornay? Lochlan?

1055
02:04:09,044 --> 02:04:13,845
I gave Mornay double his lands in
Scotland and matching estates in England.

1056
02:04:14,049 --> 02:04:18,315
Lochlan turned... for much less.

1057
02:04:18,520 --> 02:04:19,885
Archers.

1058
02:04:20,155 --> 02:04:23,147
I beg your pardon, sire?
Won't we hit our own troops?

1059
02:04:25,127 --> 02:04:26,526
Yes.

1060
02:04:26,862 --> 02:04:28,921
But we'll hit theirs as well.

1061
02:04:29,030 --> 02:04:30,793
We have reserves.

1062
02:04:32,167 --> 02:04:33,464
Attack.

1063
02:04:34,703 --> 02:04:38,867
Archers.

1064
02:05:13,875 --> 02:05:15,866
Send in our reinforcements.

1065
02:05:16,545 --> 02:05:18,035
Send in the rest.

1066
02:05:28,757 --> 02:05:30,486
Bring me Wallace.

1067
02:05:31,193 --> 02:05:32,421
Alive, if possible.

1068
02:05:32,527 --> 02:05:33,653
Dead...

1069
02:05:33,962 --> 02:05:35,156
just as good.

1070
02:05:35,931 --> 02:05:37,865
Send us news of our victory.

1071
02:05:38,366 --> 02:05:40,129
Shall we retire?

1072
02:07:04,886 --> 02:07:06,353
Protect the King.

1073
02:09:10,445 --> 02:09:11,673
Get up.

1074
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:13,338

1075
02:09:15,850 --> 02:09:17,750
Get up.

1076
02:09:18,687 --> 02:09:19,745
Get him out of here.

1077
02:09:20,021 --> 02:09:20,919
Jesus.

1078
02:09:25,326 --> 02:09:26,691
Go.

1079
02:10:27,489 --> 02:10:29,081
I'm dying.

1080
02:10:32,627 --> 02:10:34,185
Let me be.

1081
02:10:39,834 --> 02:10:41,426
No.

1082
02:10:42,337 --> 02:10:44,032
You're going to live.

1083
02:10:46,074 --> 02:10:48,872
I've lived long enough to live free.

1084
02:10:49,711 --> 02:10:51,838
Proud...

1085
02:10:51,946 --> 02:10:54,710
to see you become the man you are.

1086
02:10:59,320 --> 02:11:01,220
I'm a happy man.

1087
02:12:50,665 --> 02:12:53,532
I'm the one who's rotting.

1088
02:12:53,835 --> 02:12:57,669
But I think your face looks graver than mine.

1089
02:13:01,776 --> 02:13:03,073
Son...

1090
02:13:09,317 --> 02:13:13,344
We must have alliance with
England to prevail here.

1091
02:13:13,955 --> 02:13:16,389
You achieved that.

1092
02:13:16,491 --> 02:13:18,425
You saved your family

1093
02:13:18,526 --> 02:13:20,221
and increased your land.

1094
02:13:20,628 --> 02:13:25,190
In time, you will have
all the power in Scotland.

1095
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:26,867
Lands.

1096
02:13:26,968 --> 02:13:29,198
Titles. Men.

1097
02:13:29,304 --> 02:13:30,566
Power.

1098
02:13:30,672 --> 02:13:31,832
Nothing.

1099
02:13:31,940 --> 02:13:32,770
Nothing?

1100
02:13:32,874 --> 02:13:34,432
I have nothing.

1101
02:13:35,610 --> 02:13:37,703
Men fight for me

1102
02:13:37,812 --> 02:13:40,781
because if they do not
I throw them off my land

1103
02:13:40,882 --> 02:13:42,679
and I starve their wives and their children.

1104
02:13:43,584 --> 02:13:45,552
Those men

1105
02:13:45,753 --> 02:13:48,586
who bled the ground red at Falkirk...

1106
02:13:50,191 --> 02:13:52,955
They fought for William
Wallace, and he fights

1107
02:13:53,328 --> 02:13:56,957
for something that I've never had.

1108
02:13:58,066 --> 02:14:02,230
And I took it from him when I 
betrayed him and I saw it in his face

1109
02:14:02,337 --> 02:14:04,168
on the battlefield.

1110
02:14:04,339 --> 02:14:06,830
And it's tearing me apart.

1111
02:14:07,141 --> 02:14:09,336
Well, all men betray.

1112
02:14:09,444 --> 02:14:10,206
All lose heart.

1113
02:14:10,311 --> 02:14:12,370
I don't want to lose heart.

1114
02:14:16,884 --> 02:14:19,284
I want to believe...

1115
02:14:19,387 --> 02:14:21,617
as he does.

1116
02:14:27,395 --> 02:14:30,728
I will never be on the wrong side again.

1117
02:15:20,014 --> 02:15:22,005
No.

1118
02:16:19,040 --> 02:16:21,702
Lord Craig, is it true about Mornay?

1119
02:16:21,809 --> 02:16:23,242
Aye.

1120
02:16:24,445 --> 02:16:27,437
Wallace rode into his
bedchamber and killed him.

1121
02:16:27,548 --> 02:16:29,709
More of a liability now than ever he was.

1122
02:16:30,384 --> 02:16:31,942
And there's no telling who'll be next.

1123
02:16:35,156 --> 02:16:36,680
Maybe you.

1124
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:40,487
Maybe me.

1125
02:16:45,900 --> 02:16:47,561
It doesn't matter.

1126
02:16:49,604 --> 02:16:50,832
I'm serious, Robert.

1127
02:16:51,139 --> 02:16:52,800
So am I.

1128
02:17:05,319 --> 02:17:07,119
Christ. Shit.

1129
02:17:08,122 --> 02:17:09,885
Search the place.

1130
02:17:13,161 --> 02:17:14,753
Lochlan.

1131
02:17:21,102 --> 02:17:23,696
William Wallace killed 50 men.

1132
02:17:24,672 --> 02:17:26,663
50 if it was one.

1133
02:17:26,774 --> 02:17:27,934
100 men...

1134
02:17:28,242 --> 02:17:29,607
with his own sword.

1135
02:17:30,211 --> 02:17:31,473
Cut through them like...

1136
02:17:31,579 --> 02:17:34,309
Moses through the Red Sea.

1137
02:18:07,181 --> 02:18:09,240
His legend grows.

1138
02:18:09,350 --> 02:18:11,011
It will be worse than before.

1139
02:18:11,118 --> 02:18:14,713
He rallies new volunteers
in every Scottish town.

1140
02:18:15,489 --> 02:18:16,581
When he replenishes his numbers...

1141
02:18:16,691 --> 02:18:20,092
They're sheep. Mere sheep.

1142
02:18:21,996 --> 02:18:25,159
Easily dispersed if we strike the shepherd.

1143
02:18:25,533 --> 02:18:26,693
Very well.

1144
02:18:27,935 --> 02:18:32,497
Pick a flock of your finest
assassins and set a meeting.

1145
02:18:32,640 --> 02:18:36,872
My Lord, Wallace is renowned for
his ability to smell an ambush.

1146
02:18:40,248 --> 02:18:44,412
If what Lord Hamilton tells me is correct

1147
02:18:44,518 --> 02:18:48,682
he warmed to our future
Queen and would trust her.

1148
02:18:49,690 --> 02:18:53,387
So we'll dispatch her with the
notion that she comes in peace.

1149
02:18:53,494 --> 02:18:58,329
My Lord, the Princess might be taken
hostage or her life be put in jeopardy.

1150
02:18:58,499 --> 02:19:02,731
My son would be most distressed by that.

1151
02:19:03,137 --> 02:19:04,468
But in truth

1152
02:19:04,572 --> 02:19:06,767
if she were to be killed,

1153
02:19:07,008 --> 02:19:12,674
we would soon find the King of France
a useful ally against the Scots.

1154
02:19:14,115 --> 02:19:15,673
You see...

1155
02:19:15,783 --> 02:19:17,512
As King,

1156
02:19:17,618 --> 02:19:21,884
you must find the good in any situation.

1157
02:19:48,149 --> 02:19:50,117
It's William Wallace, sure.

1158
02:19:50,918 --> 02:19:52,943
And he's given up his sword.

1159
02:19:53,954 --> 02:19:54,921
Be ready.

1160
02:21:34,588 --> 02:21:35,646
My Lady.

1161
02:21:39,760 --> 02:21:41,660
I received your message.

1162
02:21:54,608 --> 02:21:56,303
This is...

1163
02:21:56,944 --> 02:21:59,412
the second time you've warned me of danger.

1164
02:22:01,248 --> 02:22:02,476
Why?

1165
02:22:03,284 --> 02:22:06,481
There will be a new shipment of
supplies coming north next month.

1166
02:22:06,587 --> 02:22:08,350
Foods and weapons. They will...

1167
02:22:08,589 --> 02:22:10,022
No, stop.

1168
02:22:12,293 --> 02:22:13,885
Why do you help me?

1169
02:22:20,534 --> 02:22:21,967
Why do you help me?

1170
02:22:23,671 --> 02:22:26,333
Because of the way you are looking at me now.

1171
02:24:18,986 --> 02:24:21,477
Just when we thought all hope was lost,

1172
02:24:21,589 --> 02:24:24,319
our noble saviors have arrived.

1173
02:24:27,461 --> 02:24:29,452
Off with their hoods.

1174
02:24:33,968 --> 02:24:37,028
Sir William, we come to seek a meeting.

1175
02:24:37,204 --> 02:24:38,762
Well, what's the point?

1176
02:24:39,840 --> 02:24:42,365
You've all sworn loyalty to Longshanks.

1177
02:24:42,509 --> 02:24:45,137
An oath to a liar is no oath at all.

1178
02:24:45,245 --> 02:24:47,406
Every man of us is ready
to swear loyalty to you.

1179
02:24:47,514 --> 02:24:49,880
So let the council swear publicly.

1180
02:24:50,050 --> 02:24:51,381
We cannot.

1181
02:24:51,518 --> 02:24:53,509
Some scarcely believe you're alive.

1182
02:24:53,787 --> 02:24:56,278
Others think you'll pay them Mornay's wages.

1183
02:24:56,757 --> 02:24:58,122
So we bid you to Edinburgh.

1184
02:24:58,325 --> 02:25:00,555
Meet us two days from now.
Pledge us your pardon

1185
02:25:00,661 --> 02:25:03,459
and we'll unite behind
you. Scotland will be one.

1186
02:25:03,564 --> 02:25:04,724
One?

1187
02:25:04,832 --> 02:25:05,924
You mean us and you.

1188
02:25:06,033 --> 02:25:07,432
No.

1189
02:25:09,003 --> 02:25:10,664
I mean this.

1190
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:15,206
It's the pledge of Robert the Bruce.

1191
02:25:24,885 --> 02:25:27,376
You do know it's a trap. Tell him.

1192
02:25:27,621 --> 02:25:31,216
If the Bruce wanted to kill you,
he'd have done it at Falkirk.

1193
02:25:32,159 --> 02:25:33,751
I know. I saw.

1194
02:25:33,861 --> 02:25:35,192
All right, leaving him aside,

1195
02:25:35,763 --> 02:25:37,094
what about the others?

1196
02:25:37,364 --> 02:25:39,127
Scheming bastards

1197
02:25:39,233 --> 02:25:41,599
who couldnae agree on the color of shite.

1198
02:25:41,702 --> 02:25:42,760
It's a trap. Are you blind?

1199
02:25:42,870 --> 02:25:44,462
Look at us.

1200
02:25:45,539 --> 02:25:46,972
We've got to try.

1201
02:25:47,074 --> 02:25:48,632
We can't do this alone.

1202
02:25:49,810 --> 02:25:52,404
Joining the nobles is our only hope.

1203
02:25:52,513 --> 02:25:54,071
You know what happens if we don't?

1204
02:25:54,181 --> 02:25:55,546
What?

1205
02:25:55,783 --> 02:25:57,375
Nothing.

1206
02:25:58,986 --> 02:26:00,578
I don't want to be a martyr.

1207
02:26:01,488 --> 02:26:02,716
Nor I.

1208
02:26:02,823 --> 02:26:04,313
I want to live.

1209
02:26:04,725 --> 02:26:06,886
I want a home, and children.

1210
02:26:06,994 --> 02:26:08,222
And peace. Do ye?

1211
02:26:08,328 --> 02:26:09,556
Aye, I do.

1212
02:26:09,663 --> 02:26:11,631
I've asked God for those things.

1213
02:26:12,366 --> 02:26:14,561
It's all for nothing if
you don't have freedom.

1214
02:26:14,668 --> 02:26:15,600
It's just a dream, William.

1215
02:26:15,703 --> 02:26:17,136
A dream? Just a...

1216
02:26:18,505 --> 02:26:21,872
Well, then, what have we
been doing all this time?

1217
02:26:23,143 --> 02:26:25,008
We've lived that dream.

1218
02:26:25,112 --> 02:26:26,841
Your dream isn't about freedom.

1219
02:26:27,047 --> 02:26:28,810
It's about Murron.

1220
02:26:28,916 --> 02:26:31,749
You're doing this to be a hero
because you think she sees ye.

1221
02:26:31,919 --> 02:26:34,547
I don't think she sees me. I know she does.

1222
02:26:35,289 --> 02:26:37,223
And your father sees you, too.

1223
02:26:47,468 --> 02:26:48,799
Jesus.

1224
02:26:51,271 --> 02:26:53,034

1225
02:26:56,577 --> 02:26:57,805
Shall I come with you?

1226
02:26:59,613 --> 02:27:00,773
No.

1227
02:27:01,482 --> 02:27:02,710
I'll go alone.

1228
02:27:04,384 --> 02:27:06,113
I'll see you after.

1229
02:27:12,226 --> 02:27:14,888
Sooner rather than later, I hope.

1230
02:27:21,135 --> 02:27:22,033
He won't come.

1231
02:27:22,136 --> 02:27:23,103
He will.

1232
02:27:24,605 --> 02:27:25,594
I know he will.

1233
02:27:40,621 --> 02:27:42,384
My Lord. He approaches.

1234
02:28:26,333 --> 02:28:27,823
No!

1235
02:28:32,906 --> 02:28:34,237
Stay out of it, Robert.

1236
02:28:36,710 --> 02:28:38,371
Get away.

1237
02:28:41,882 --> 02:28:43,281
The Bruce is not to be harmed,

1238
02:28:43,383 --> 02:28:44,680
that's the arrangement.

1239
02:28:53,026 --> 02:28:54,789
Father!

1240
02:29:00,567 --> 02:29:04,059
You rotting bastard!

1241
02:29:04,171 --> 02:29:06,036
Why?

1242
02:29:10,611 --> 02:29:13,444
Longshanks required Wallace.

1243
02:29:14,081 --> 02:29:15,912
So did our nobles.

1244
02:29:16,350 --> 02:29:19,581
That was the price of your crown.

1245
02:29:19,686 --> 02:29:21,119
Die.

1246
02:29:22,456 --> 02:29:23,980
I want you to die.

1247
02:29:24,358 --> 02:29:26,519
Soon enough I'll be dead.

1248
02:29:26,894 --> 02:29:28,657
And you'll be King.

1249
02:29:28,762 --> 02:29:30,855
I don't want anything from you.

1250
02:29:31,465 --> 02:29:32,989
You're not a man.

1251
02:29:34,334 --> 02:29:35,699
And you're not my father.

1252
02:29:40,207 --> 02:29:42,266
You're my son

1253
02:29:42,476 --> 02:29:44,774
and you have always known my mind.

1254
02:29:46,847 --> 02:29:48,337
You deceived me.

1255
02:29:48,448 --> 02:29:50,848
You let yourself be deceived.

1256
02:29:51,018 --> 02:29:55,045
In your heart, you always
knew what had to happen here.

1257
02:29:57,991 --> 02:29:59,481
At last,

1258
02:29:59,660 --> 02:30:01,651
you know what it means to hate.

1259
02:30:05,933 --> 02:30:09,096
Now you're ready to be a king.

1260
02:30:10,070 --> 02:30:11,970
My hate...

1261
02:30:12,072 --> 02:30:14,870
will die with you.

1262
02:30:19,613 --> 02:30:21,205
William Wallace,

1263
02:30:21,348 --> 02:30:23,976
you stand in taint of high treason.

1264
02:30:24,985 --> 02:30:26,350
Against whom?

1265
02:30:26,453 --> 02:30:27,977
Against your King.

1266
02:30:29,456 --> 02:30:31,321
Have you anything to say?

1267
02:30:32,392 --> 02:30:34,758
Never in my whole life

1268
02:30:36,029 --> 02:30:38,827
did I swear allegiance to him.

1269
02:30:39,733 --> 02:30:41,098
It matters not.

1270
02:30:41,501 --> 02:30:43,059
He is your King.

1271
02:30:45,339 --> 02:30:46,533
Confess

1272
02:30:46,640 --> 02:30:48,699
and you may receive a quick death.

1273
02:30:49,176 --> 02:30:52,304
Deny and you must be purified by pain.

1274
02:30:52,412 --> 02:30:53,845
Do you confess?

1275
02:30:55,949 --> 02:30:59,578
Do you confess?

1276
02:31:04,925 --> 02:31:08,793
Then on the morrow you shall
receive your purification.

1277
02:31:20,741 --> 02:31:21,605
Your Highness.

1278
02:31:21,708 --> 02:31:22,538
I will see the prisoner.

1279
02:31:22,642 --> 02:31:23,768
The King ordered...

1280
02:31:23,877 --> 02:31:26,277
The King will die soon and his son is weak.

1281
02:31:26,380 --> 02:31:28,678
Who do you think will rule this kingdom?

1282
02:31:29,016 --> 02:31:30,449
Now open this door.

1283
02:31:32,953 --> 02:31:34,181
Your Majesty.

1284
02:31:40,660 --> 02:31:42,651
Come on, filth. Up on your feet.

1285
02:31:42,796 --> 02:31:44,058
Stop it.

1286
02:31:45,098 --> 02:31:46,258
Leave me.

1287
02:31:47,401 --> 02:31:48,993
I said leave me.

1288
02:32:02,149 --> 02:32:03,707
My Lady.

1289
02:32:04,518 --> 02:32:05,780
Sir...

1290
02:32:07,187 --> 02:32:09,018
I come to beg you...

1291
02:32:10,757 --> 02:32:14,022
to confess all and swear allegiance
to the King that he might

1292
02:32:14,127 --> 02:32:15,424
show you mercy.

1293
02:32:16,430 --> 02:32:18,728
Will he show mercy to my country?

1294
02:32:19,733 --> 02:32:22,167
Mercy is to die quickly,

1295
02:32:22,269 --> 02:32:24,134
perhaps even live in the Tower.

1296
02:32:24,237 --> 02:32:26,467
In time, who knows what can happen?

1297
02:32:28,442 --> 02:32:30,171
If you can only live...

1298
02:32:34,915 --> 02:32:36,542
If I swear to him...

1299
02:32:37,517 --> 02:32:39,678
then all that I am...

1300
02:32:39,786 --> 02:32:41,617
is dead already.

1301
02:32:50,263 --> 02:32:52,823
You will die. It will be awful.

1302
02:32:52,966 --> 02:32:54,661
Every man dies.

1303
02:32:57,370 --> 02:32:59,531
Not every man really lives.

1304
02:33:05,912 --> 02:33:07,436
Drink this.

1305
02:33:08,782 --> 02:33:10,682
It will dull your pain.

1306
02:33:11,051 --> 02:33:13,747
No. It will numb my wits.

1307
02:33:13,854 --> 02:33:15,481
And I must have them all.

1308
02:33:16,256 --> 02:33:19,316
For if I'm senseless or if I wail

1309
02:33:19,426 --> 02:33:21,724
then Longshanks will have broken me.

1310
02:33:21,895 --> 02:33:24,489
I can't bear the thought of your torture.

1311
02:33:25,265 --> 02:33:27,130
Take it.

1312
02:33:31,738 --> 02:33:33,399
All right.

1313
02:34:20,420 --> 02:34:25,653
I have come to beg for the
life of William Wallace.

1314
02:34:27,160 --> 02:34:29,594
You're quite taken with him, aren't you?

1315
02:34:30,130 --> 02:34:31,529
I respect him.

1316
02:34:33,733 --> 02:34:35,257
At worst, he was a worthy enemy.

1317
02:34:35,368 --> 02:34:37,558
Show mercy, O thou great King,

1318
02:34:38,170 --> 02:34:40,371
and win the respect of your own people.

1319
02:34:49,849 --> 02:34:51,248
Even now

1320
02:34:52,652 --> 02:34:55,086
you are incapable of mercy.

1321
02:35:01,561 --> 02:35:02,926
And you...

1322
02:35:07,167 --> 02:35:10,933
To you, that word is as unfamiliar as love.

1323
02:35:11,171 --> 02:35:13,605
Before he lost his powers of speech

1324
02:35:13,707 --> 02:35:17,973
he told me his one comfort was that he
would live to know Wallace was dead.

1325
02:35:37,097 --> 02:35:38,530
You see?

1326
02:35:40,367 --> 02:35:42,892
Death comes to us all.

1327
02:35:52,279 --> 02:35:55,214
But before it comes to you,

1328
02:35:55,615 --> 02:35:57,947
know this:

1329
02:35:58,051 --> 02:36:00,849
Your blood dies with you.

1330
02:36:02,622 --> 02:36:06,718
A child who is not of your
line grows in my belly.

1331
02:36:07,694 --> 02:36:12,961
Your son will not sit long
on the throne, I swear it.

1332
02:36:50,637 --> 02:36:52,628
I'm so afraid.

1333
02:37:00,280 --> 02:37:02,373
Give me the strength...

1334
02:37:03,450 --> 02:37:04,974
to die well.

1335
02:37:29,008 --> 02:37:30,737
Here he comes.

1336
02:38:59,466 --> 02:39:02,902
Now behold the awful price of treason.

1337
02:39:09,209 --> 02:39:11,439
Or fall to your knees now,

1338
02:39:13,379 --> 02:39:16,348
declare yourself the King's loyal subject

1339
02:39:17,350 --> 02:39:19,648
and beg his mercy

1340
02:39:26,059 --> 02:39:28,391
and you shall have it.

1341
02:39:39,672 --> 02:39:40,730
Rope.

1342
02:39:53,553 --> 02:39:54,645
Raise him.

1343
02:40:03,162 --> 02:40:04,595
Stretch him.

1344
02:40:06,833 --> 02:40:08,824
That's it.

1345
02:40:08,902 --> 02:40:10,995
Stretch him.

1346
02:40:47,307 --> 02:40:49,468
Pleasant, yes?

1347
02:40:52,579 --> 02:40:54,672
Rise to your knees.

1348
02:40:54,781 --> 02:40:57,181
Kiss the royal emblem on my cloak

1349
02:40:57,584 --> 02:40:59,848
and you will feel no more.

1350
02:41:41,094 --> 02:41:42,493
Rack him.

1351
02:42:37,116 --> 02:42:38,640
Enough?

1352
02:43:31,604 --> 02:43:34,300
It can all end...

1353
02:43:34,407 --> 02:43:36,068
right now.

1354
02:43:36,242 --> 02:43:37,971
Peace.

1355
02:43:38,811 --> 02:43:40,676
Bliss.

1356
02:43:40,780 --> 02:43:42,611
Just say it.

1357
02:43:43,249 --> 02:43:45,046
Cry out...

1358
02:43:45,485 --> 02:43:46,884
"Mercy."

1359
02:43:56,162 --> 02:43:57,527

1360
02:43:58,865 --> 02:44:05,566
Mercy. Mercy.

1361
02:44:05,671 --> 02:44:06,797
Cry out.

1361
02:44:13,315 --> 02:44:15,180
Just say it.

1362
02:44:15,815 --> 02:44:17,180
"Mercy."

1363
02:44:40,439 --> 02:44:43,431
Mercy, William. Mercy.

1364
02:44:43,543 --> 02:44:45,067
Jesus, man, say it.

1365
02:44:46,546 --> 02:44:50,482

1366
02:44:50,850 --> 02:44:54,377
The prisoner wishes to say a word.

1367
02:45:14,140 --> 02:45:23,811
Freedom!

1368
02:47:09,722 --> 02:47:12,088
After the beheading,

1369
02:47:12,224 --> 02:47:15,990
William Wallace's body was torn to pieces.

1370
02:47:18,264 --> 02:47:21,427
His head was set on London Bridge.

1371
02:47:22,768 --> 02:47:25,134
His arms and legs

1372
02:47:25,237 --> 02:47:29,867
sent to the four corners
of Britain as a warning.

1373
02:47:30,643 --> 02:47:35,376
It did not have the effect
that Longshanks planned.

1374
02:47:36,215 --> 02:47:39,651
And I, Robert the Bruce,

1375
02:47:39,752 --> 02:47:44,553
rode out to pay homage to the
armies of the English King

1376
02:47:44,724 --> 02:47:48,626
and accept his endorsement of my crown.

1377
02:47:48,728 --> 02:47:51,356
I hope you've washed your arse this morning.

1378
02:47:51,464 --> 02:47:53,932
It's about to be kissed by a king.

1379
02:48:23,362 --> 02:48:26,661
Come. Let's get it over with.

1380
02:48:38,077 --> 02:48:39,339
Stop.

1381
02:48:57,329 --> 02:49:00,230
You have bled with Wallace!

1382
02:49:05,538 --> 02:49:07,904
Now bleed with me.

1383
02:49:47,913 --> 02:49:57,788
Wallace!

1384
02:50:14,707 --> 02:50:18,108
In the year of our Lord 1314,

1385
02:50:18,577 --> 02:50:22,172
patriots of Scotland,
starving and outnumbered,

1386
02:50:22,381 --> 02:50:25,009
charged the fields of Bannockburn.

1387
02:50:26,018 --> 02:50:28,578
They fought like warrior poets.

1388
02:50:28,854 --> 02:50:31,049
They fought like Scotsmen

1389
02:50:32,091 --> 02:50:34,355
and won their freedom.

1390
02:50:43,169 --> 02:50:46,900

1391
02:50:48,474 --> 02:50:52,570

1392
02:50:53,679 --> 02:50:58,013

1393
02:51:36,288 --> 02:51:40,384

1394
02:51:41,594 --> 02:51:46,088

1395
02:52:07,152 --> 02:52:13,318
