00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:43,354
Try to speak plain.

184
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:45,106
Saves time.

185
00:13:48,569 --> 00:13:51,529
I have authority from
the DA's office

186
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:54,365
to put you right back on
the next plane to Amarillo.

187
00:13:55,826 --> 00:14:00,205
Well, you just do that, son.
I'd like to see that authority.

188
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:10,340
All right, Lieutenant Enright,
what's your deal?

189
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:11,758
All right.

190
00:14:14,261 --> 00:14:15,929
I'm gonna ask some questions.

191
00:14:16,931 --> 00:14:19,933
Put it in the press. Get it in the news.

192
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:23,520
Any information about this accident...

193
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,399
...and maybe some witnesses.

194
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:33,029
Yes, sir, I...
I know some old boys at the paper.

195
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,906
We'll get your story out for you.

196
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:40,703
Brazos.

197
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,751
Brazos!

198
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,506
Remember the Alamo, cowboy.

201
00:14:59,957 --> 00:15:01,540
I won!

202
00:15:02,017 --> 00:15:03,601
Wanna fuck?

203
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,019
Asshole.

204
00:15:08,232 --> 00:15:11,025
You need a witness? I'm a witness.

205
00:15:11,193 --> 00:15:14,028
This Mercedes? I think I was talking
to those kids when it happened.

206
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:15,780
No way was that an accident.

207
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,448
- You saw it.
- No, but I heard it.

208
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:19,617
You can listen. It's here on tape.

209
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,954
Oh, shit. Come on.

210
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:34,507
Regulations.
We gotta record all the call-ins.

211
00:15:34,675 --> 00:15:35,967
End of the night, we wipe the tapes,

212
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,970
but I kept this one just 'cause...
It just got to me.

213
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:41,139
- We got professionals working...
- I didn't know what I heard,

214
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:42,265
but I read your story.
What you're looking for

215
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,183
- is on this tape.
- ...so don't fool with it.

216
00:15:46,604 --> 00:15:48,521
You can slow it down now.

217
00:15:54,737 --> 00:15:57,155
You're just a joke
in this morning's paper.

218
00:15:57,323 --> 00:15:59,407
"Cowboy chases chainsaws 14 years.

219
00:15:59,575 --> 00:16:01,159
Dallas police refuse comment."

220
00:16:01,327 --> 00:16:04,495
Like you're, you know,
hung up on something crazy.

221
00:16:04,663 --> 00:16:07,123
But I believe you.
I might be the only believer you got.

222
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,667
- 'Cause it's right here.
- What is?

223
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:12,337
Right on here,
those kids getting killed.

224
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,505
Now, this is evidence, sort of, right?

225
00:16:17,384 --> 00:16:20,261
Yeah, it's time for you to go home.

226
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:21,554
- No, wait a minute.
- Come on.

227
00:16:21,722 --> 00:16:24,891
Look, I came here
because I thought I could help you.

228
00:16:25,059 --> 00:16:27,518
I deejay this dumb show
on K-OKLA up in Burkburnett,

229
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,687
but people listen to me
all across North Texas.

230
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:31,022
Now, I could put you on the radio,

231
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,816
get people to believe you,
get you some help.

232
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:37,070
You're gonna get in my way.

233
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:39,822
- Don't you get in my way.
- No, I'm already right

234
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:41,032
in the middle of this.

235
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,326
This is my chance
to stop playing head-banging music

236
00:16:43,494 --> 00:16:44,911
and do something real.

237
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:49,415
Well, I don't need anybody
to stand with me,

238
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:50,708
all right?

239
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:53,711
You can't do it alone.

240
00:16:56,548 --> 00:16:59,342
I got a perfect willingness to die.

241
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:02,887
That gives me a moral
on this bunch of mad dogs.

242
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,391
They live on fear. They thrive on it.

243
00:17:06,558 --> 00:17:09,978
I ain't got no fear left.

244
00:17:10,145 --> 00:17:11,521
Adios.

245
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,037
I ain't got no fear, Lord.

248
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,274
- Hardass.
- Hardass? Me?

249
00:17:58,444 --> 00:18:02,238
Well, maybe a semi-hardass,
but I got a soft heart.

250
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:03,614
Looky.

251
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:08,494
- Built you a little fry house.
- L.G.!

252
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:10,705
What, darling?

253
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:13,916
Oh, L.G.

255
00:18:31,101 --> 00:18:35,063
OK, everybody, hush up.
Listen up, y'all.

256
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:38,316
The Texas-OU Chili
Cook-off champion is

257
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:43,321
- from Norman, Oklahoma? No.
- No!

258
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,823
Waco, Texas? Mm-mm.

259
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:47,492
Tulsa? Nope.

260
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,244
- Pardon me.
- Austin? Uh-uh.

261
00:18:50,412 --> 00:18:54,999
He's Dallas' favorite caterer,
and I think he's kind of cute.

262
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:58,669
The Last Round-up Rolling Grill chef,

263
00:18:58,837 --> 00:19:02,757
Drayton Sawyer!

264
00:19:03,509 --> 00:19:07,512
Drayton! Drayton!
Drayton! Drayton!

265
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,933
Drayton! Drayton! Drayton! Drayton!

266
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:22,610
It's the second year in a row.
This year, Drayton,

267
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:27,115
you've got to tell the secret
of that fabulously tasty chili!

268
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:29,534
No secret. It's the meat.

269
00:19:29,701 --> 00:19:31,369
Don't skimp on the meat.

270
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:35,873
I got a real good eye for prime meat.

271
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,292
Runs in the family.

272
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,836
Whoop! Whoop!

273
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:43,714
It's one of those, uh,
hard-shell peppercorns.

274
00:19:45,175 --> 00:19:48,052
I gotta say, I love this town.

275
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,221
This town loves prime meat!

277
00:19:57,229 --> 00:20:01,774
So there's the big story.
Texas clobbers Oklahoma in chili.

278
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:06,237
This is Stretch, your fearless
reporter, live from Dallas.

281
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,767
Now, be sure to watch
your drinking and driving

282
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,770
on this wild and woolly
Texas-OU Weekend.

283
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:42,607
This is Stretch, on K-OKLA...

284
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:56,787
Cut-Rite.

285
00:20:58,165 --> 00:21:01,500
No, C.L., I ain't seen Fletcher.

286
00:21:01,668 --> 00:21:03,336
Well, last Friday.

287
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:07,298
Well, hell, he's on the road, then.

288
00:21:10,093 --> 00:21:12,929
Well, don't believe me, then. Fine.

289
00:21:13,096 --> 00:21:14,388
C.L...

290
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,475
No.

291
00:21:20,938 --> 00:21:23,953
I'll be with you in just a minute, sir.

292
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:29,320
Now, you're getting
as mean as a sting bat, C.L.

293
00:21:31,073 --> 00:21:34,492
No, hell, don't call back.

294
00:21:35,535 --> 00:21:37,745
No, don't you call back.
I got a business here,

295
00:21:37,913 --> 00:21:40,831
and Fletcher ain't none of my business.

296
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,333

There's gas in them.

309
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,912
Get them suckers a time or two.

310
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:27,813
Oh, my kid banana.

311
00:23:39,868 --> 00:23:42,036
Damn, what is he doing?

313
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:08,479
Now, this is very hard to believe.

314
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:16,987
I'd like you to play that tape, missy.

315
00:24:18,698 --> 00:24:22,910
Come all the way up here to Burkburnett.
No shit!

316
00:24:23,078 --> 00:24:24,328
Yeah.

317
00:24:26,623 --> 00:24:28,666
Oh, you wanna hear it now.

318
00:24:29,167 --> 00:24:30,751
I wanna hear it on the radio.

319
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:32,461
On your show.

320
00:24:32,629 --> 00:24:34,046
Uh-uh.

321
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,426
I don't think it'd be legal to do that.

322
00:24:38,593 --> 00:24:41,846
FCC regulations, those things.

323
00:24:42,013 --> 00:24:45,766
Well, you just figure out
how to do it and do it.

324
00:24:45,934 --> 00:24:48,018
You bend the rules. I don't know.

325
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:50,980
Huh!

326
00:24:52,524 --> 00:24:55,860
- Why?
- Because the killers are here.

327
00:24:56,862 --> 00:25:00,781
Kill sites have been clustered all over
Northeast Texas the last two years.

328
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,666
The laws, they shy away
from piecing it together as murder.

329
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,877
They call it accidents, disappearances.

330
00:25:13,044 --> 00:25:16,714
You got that last slaughter on tape.
You play it on the radio.

331
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:21,093
Maybe then, the laws will stop trying
to shut me up and start helping me.

332
00:25:21,553 --> 00:25:24,972
Besides, it'll give you
something real to do.

333
00:25:26,183 --> 00:25:29,226
You said you were gonna do this alone.

334
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:31,437
I need your help, missy.

335
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:41,322
Well...

336
00:25:42,324 --> 00:25:44,825
...you can call me Stretch,
Mr. Enright.

337
00:25:44,993 --> 00:25:47,161
Well, now, you can call me Lefty.

338
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:51,123
It's mighty nice
doing business with you.

339
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,044
- Thanks.
- All right.

340
00:25:55,212 --> 00:25:57,379
You have a nice day, now.

341
00:25:58,715 --> 00:25:59,924

So here's a special request
we're doing this afternoon and tonight.

350
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,144
You steady listeners know
we're playing this every hour.

351

This is for Lefty.

00:26:57,649 --> 00:27:01,151
Hog fucker! Son of a bitch!

354
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:10,703
Ah! Last Round-up Rolling Grill.
We're still number one.

355
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:13,872
I told you, boys, and I told you.

356
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:17,918
Don't call on this phone.
Now, damn it, get off.

357
00:27:18,086 --> 00:27:21,589
What? What's on the radio?

358
00:27:21,756 --> 00:27:25,259
Now, don't bullshit me. I can't...

359
00:27:25,427 --> 00:27:28,387
I won't... All right, what station?

360
00:27:28,555 --> 00:27:30,806
This ain't no joke, boy?

361
00:27:30,974 --> 00:27:33,434
Then I'm tuning it in.

362
00:27:33,602 --> 00:27:37,021
Hog fucker! Son of a bitch!

363
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:41,525
You two nap-haired idiots.
You've done it again!

364
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:46,697
You coon shits! You fudge-packers!
You'll be the death of me yet!

367
00:27:57,876 --> 00:27:59,209
Missed us, assholes.

369
00:28:01,379 --> 00:28:02,713
K-OKLA.

370
00:28:04,466 --> 00:28:05,924
Come on, Lefty. Where are you?

372
00:28:11,222 --> 00:28:14,808
This concludes the broadcast day
for K-OKLA in Burkburnett, Texas,

373
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,393
Red River Rock 'n' Roll.

374
00:28:16,561 --> 00:28:19,063
In New York, it's 1 am,
still fun city.

375
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,814
In LA, 10 at night, party time.

376
00:28:20,982 --> 00:28:23,442
But deep in the heart of Texas,
it's 12 midnight.

377
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,944
Ain't nothing going on.

378
00:28:28,073 --> 00:28:31,992
It's another cussing caller.

379
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:35,704
Your little ass is gonna be
in big trouble over that tape, girl.

380
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:37,081
Nope.

382
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:02,106
Sure got a lot of complaints,
darling.

383
00:29:06,403 --> 00:29:10,364
L.G., it was a request, right?
It's listed in the logs as a request.

384
00:29:10,532 --> 00:29:12,866
People complain
about the request every night, right?

385
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,244
Uh-huh.

386
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:29,508
Wanna go for coffee at Big State?

387
00:29:30,969 --> 00:29:32,136
Nope.

388
00:29:35,932 --> 00:29:38,142
Huh, I guess you're waiting
on this guy, Lefty?

389
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,479
L.G.

390
00:29:45,942 --> 00:29:46,984

391
00:29:47,152 --> 00:29:48,944
Good night.

00:29:49,112 --> 00:29:53,073

I wanna buy some radio-ad time.

429
00:32:26,978 --> 00:32:29,771
Are you fucking crazy? We are closed!

430
00:32:29,939 --> 00:32:33,483
Off the air till tomorrow.
You'll have to just come back.

431
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,652
No, but... But, yeah, but...

432
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,654
Whoa!

433
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:40,866
So this is radio land, huh?
The infinite turnover?

434
00:32:41,034 --> 00:32:43,535
The waves through
the ether fuzz roll on forever.

435
00:32:43,703 --> 00:32:46,997
Roar!

436
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,207
Can't close that.
Hi, I know what you're thinking.

437
00:32:49,375 --> 00:32:51,668
"This is weird. Hope I can handle it."


438
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:52,836
You know...

439
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,509
...you're my fave.

440
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:04,222
Me and Bubba, my little brother,
we listen to you every night.

441
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:08,352
Music is my life.

442
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,271
You know, you're my fave,

443
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:15,025
but I get too embarrassed
to phone in my request.

444
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,194
It's too disembodied, you know?

445
00:33:18,613 --> 00:33:21,031
But...

446
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:23,200
...now that we're here
in flesh and blood,

447
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:26,203
I could maybe make a request,
and it'd still count, huh?

448
00:33:28,081 --> 00:33:29,748
Sure. Mm-hm.

449
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:35,379
Well, what about...

450
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:38,215
...Iron Butterfly? 

451
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:41,843
You know, like
"In-A-Vida-Da-Gadda, Baby?"

452
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:44,471
It's heavy! You know,

453
00:33:44,639 --> 00:33:48,976
I've never been to
a radio station before.

454
00:33:49,143 --> 00:33:51,478
Do you think you could
do me a tour, huh?

455
00:33:51,646 --> 00:33:52,646
Tour?

456
00:33:55,483 --> 00:33:57,901
Tour. Sure, sure.

457
00:33:58,069 --> 00:34:01,655
But seriously quick,
and it ends at the exit sign.

458
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:05,325
Oh, boy! OK, yeah, sure!

459
00:34:06,327 --> 00:34:09,413
OK, your tour. Here's your tour.
Here's your tour. Here's a lamp.

460
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,164
Yeah, lamp.

461
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:13,417
- Here's a typewriter.
- Oh!

462
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:16,378
- Rubber man.
- Uh-huh. Rubber man. I like him.

463
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:19,756
Armadillo. Here's Mr. Shark.

464
00:34:19,924 --> 00:34:21,258
Oh, Mr. Shark! 

465
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:25,762
- Here's some flowers.
- Flowers.

466
00:34:27,473 --> 00:34:29,016
Rolodex.

467
00:34:31,269 --> 00:34:33,311
- Here's a lamp.
- Oh!

468
00:34:33,479 --> 00:34:35,981
And there's the exit sign. Tour's over.

469
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:40,068
Oh... 

470
00:34:52,331 --> 00:34:55,542
"E-X...

471
00:34:56,669 --> 00:34:59,588
...I-T.

472
00:34:59,756 --> 00:35:02,257
Exit." 

473
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,970
- Good night.
- Oh. Good night!

474
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:10,307
Good night!

475
00:35:11,893 --> 00:35:13,226
Good night.

476
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:19,983
Good night!

477
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,153
Good night.

479
00:35:28,785 --> 00:35:31,369
Hey, what about my request?

480
00:35:32,955 --> 00:35:34,206
You know.

481
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:38,460
That Lefty-request record

482
00:35:38,628 --> 00:35:41,713
that you honked out today?

483
00:35:41,881 --> 00:35:44,007
I love that.

484
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,009
Let's see...

486
00:35:56,896 --> 00:36:00,690
What was it, anyway?
The Rambo 3 soundtrack?

487
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,492
Gonna play it again?

488
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,833
Sure would like it.

489
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,712
Hey, maybe I could get a copy,

490
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,174
and you could autograph it.

491
00:36:26,342 --> 00:36:31,138
To a... a far-out fan!

492
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:34,391
- What's in here?
- Record vault.

493
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,726
Oh, where you keep the golden oldies?

494
00:36:36,894 --> 00:36:39,521
And, uh, maybe...

495
00:36:39,689 --> 00:36:40,897
Maybe the new music's in...

497
00:36:44,318 --> 00:36:46,778
Ow! Not me, you dumbass!

498

Oh!

00:40:14,904 --> 00:40:16,363
What the fuck you think
you're doing in here,

544
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:19,115
you crazy-looking little son of a bitch?
Get out of here!

546
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:39,219
Time for incoming mail!

548
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:44,432
Ho Chi Minh!

550
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:54,776
A-one and a-two and a-three!

551
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,160
Go, you little bitch!

557
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:33,982
Go away! Leave me alone!

561
00:42:19,653 --> 00:42:22,405
No, no, no, no! God, no, please don't!

562
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:24,324
Incoming mail!

563
00:42:25,701 --> 00:42:27,410
No, no, no!

564
00:42:27,578 --> 00:42:30,205
No, no, no, please, God, no!

565
00:42:37,755 --> 00:42:41,049
No, no, no, please, God!
Please, God, no!

566
00:42:41,217 --> 00:42:43,259
No!

567
00:42:43,427 --> 00:42:48,598
No, no, no, please, God!
Stop it! God, no!

568
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:50,433
No, no, please, God!

569
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:56,648
Are you mad at me?

570
00:42:59,068 --> 00:43:01,152
How mad at me are you?

571
00:43:04,907 --> 00:43:06,699
You're not really mad at me.

573
00:43:18,379 --> 00:43:20,588
How good are you?

574
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:26,427
Huh?

575
00:43:39,024 --> 00:43:40,316
Get that bitch, Leatherface!

576
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:41,734
Get that bitch!

577
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:50,034
How good...

578
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:54,372
...are you?

580
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:06,759
Oh.

581
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:19,147
Really?

582
00:44:22,693 --> 00:44:27,196
Are you really, really...

583
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:28,781
...good?

585
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:40,835
Are you really good? Really good?

586
00:44:43,380 --> 00:44:45,548
You're really good.

588
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:53,723
You're the best.

589
00:45:03,192 --> 00:45:04,233
Oh, no.

593
00:45:18,957 --> 00:45:20,041
No! No!

594
00:45:27,508 --> 00:45:28,841
Please don't kill me!

595
00:45:29,009 --> 00:45:32,762
No, God!

596
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:36,182
No, please, God!

597
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,850
No, God!

600
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:59,622
Oh, God! Oh, God!

602
00:46:13,178 --> 00:46:15,471
Leatherface. 

603
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:20,351
Did you get her, Bubba?
Did you get that bitch?

604
00:46:24,523 --> 00:46:29,152
She was my fave, but she knew.

605
00:46:29,319 --> 00:46:33,239
And now, nobody knows.

606
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,662
Look what you did
to my plate, you bitch!

607
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,417
You got her? Did you get her good?

608
00:46:45,502 --> 00:46:47,962
Slap me five.

609
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,047
I got one, too.

610
00:46:50,215 --> 00:46:54,677
A bonus body!

611
00:46:54,845 --> 00:46:56,679
Look at that beef.

612
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,431
Help me get it out of here.

613
00:47:04,646 --> 00:47:07,440
Oh!

614
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:09,484
Ooh...

615
00:47:10,903 --> 00:47:13,696
Giddyup!

616
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:24,290
No, they'll get away.

617
00:47:24,458 --> 00:47:26,459
No, no, they'll get away.

618
00:47:28,253 --> 00:47:30,129
They can't get away.

620
00:47:44,978 --> 00:47:47,271
God damn it, Lefty. You're late.

621
00:47:59,868 --> 00:48:01,702
Damn it, Lefty.

622
00:50:05,118 --> 00:50:06,953
Oh!

625
00:50:43,407 --> 00:50:44,699
Stretch!

626
00:50:47,411 --> 00:50:48,411
Lefty?

627
00:50:52,416 --> 00:50:54,917
Stretch!

628
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,045
Hold on!

629
00:50:58,213 --> 00:51:00,089
Grab onto something. Hold onto it.

630
00:51:01,508 --> 00:51:04,427
Lefty, they came! Where were you?

631
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:08,222
I had to do it.
Damn, I used you, girl.

632
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:10,099
I'm here now. Grab hold of this.

633
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:15,187
Grab hold of this, now. Don't you cry,
little sister. I'm here now.

634
00:51:15,355 --> 00:51:17,481
Come on, I'm here now.
You can get it. Come on, now.

635
00:51:23,947 --> 00:51:25,448
You got it. Come on.

636
00:51:26,742 --> 00:51:30,119
Come on! Grab it!

638
00:52:11,036 --> 00:52:12,787
Oh, my God.

639
00:52:47,697 --> 00:52:52,868
Oh, Lord, help me beat this stranger
that walks beside me,

640
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:55,037
that takes away my strength.

641
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:59,041
Lord, you show me the end.

642
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:03,003
Show me what I fear
so I don't fear it no more.

645
00:54:32,761 --> 00:54:34,762
It's the devil's playground.

646
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,356
I'm bringing it down! Down to hell!

647
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:51,200
Bring it all down!

648
00:54:52,651 --> 00:54:56,200
Bring it all down!

652
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:45,207
I hate to say it,
but that hillbilly hog you boys

653
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,501
got earlier is the top tonight.

654
00:55:47,669 --> 00:55:50,671
That's mine! Mine!
Not Bubba's. Me! Me!

655
00:55:50,839 --> 00:55:52,089
Bust it up!

656
00:55:52,257 --> 00:55:53,465
Wanna go to the movies?

657
00:55:53,633 --> 00:55:56,302
No crowds.
Everybody's at the football parties.

658
00:55:56,469 --> 00:55:57,970
Tonight's a washout.

659
00:55:58,138 --> 00:56:02,057
Biggest meat-eater weekend of the month,
and we're gonna lose money on it.

660
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:04,351
Damn it all!
Maybe we just ought to quit.

661
00:56:04,519 --> 00:56:09,064
Oh, yeah? Kiss my plate,
Mr. Big Shot. Maybe you forgot.

662
00:56:09,232 --> 00:56:11,567
This chrome dome
bankrolled this food business.

663
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,236
No lucky gook with a machete,
no head wound.

664
00:56:14,404 --> 00:56:17,614
No head wound,
no fancy rolling grill a-go-go.

665
00:56:17,782 --> 00:56:20,743
Ain't no fool. Kiss it.
Don't forget it.

667
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:29,501
Peel that pig and slice him thick.

668
00:56:29,669 --> 00:56:33,172
- That's my sweet pea.
- Get them hogs on the grill.

669
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:37,968
Big, big pre-game brunch tomorrow
means a ton of croissant sandwiches.

670
00:56:38,136 --> 00:56:39,928
Oh, I love this town.

671
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:43,849
Hey, you nitwit, get back in here
and get that grill going.

680
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:55,814
No. No. No good.

681
00:58:55,982 --> 00:59:00,986
No good.

683
00:59:30,433 --> 00:59:33,852
Come on, Bubba. Cook's out here,
and he's chewing ass like it was steak.

684
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:36,230
"You gotta run for that money now.

685
00:59:36,397 --> 00:59:38,565
Chase that dollar.
Gotta go fast to catch it."

686
00:59:38,733 --> 00:59:41,777
You dumb baboons are
too dumb to even close the door.

687
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:43,695
I'm tired of kicking your asses.

688
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,743
What are you doing?
You trying to hide something?

690
00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,543
Get that eyeball pâté working.

691
00:59:57,710 --> 01:00:02,256
Hey, you coon shit, where are you going?
We need the club sandwiches...

692
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:07,553
Help. Help me. Please.

693
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:10,472
Please, help me.

694
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,810
Can you help me get out of here?

695
01:00:20,149 --> 01:00:23,151
What is it? Put that down.
Put that down.

696
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,112
Put that down.

697
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,655
What is that?

698
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,325
Is it wet? It's wet. Put it down.

710
01:03:17,201 --> 01:03:18,577
My darling.

712
01:03:22,457 --> 01:03:25,500
Darling?

713
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:28,628
Don't be scared, darling.

716
01:03:35,887 --> 01:03:37,429
Oh no, L.G.

717
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,562
Oh no. Oh no.

718
01:03:46,564 --> 01:03:48,231
L.G.!

719
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:50,442
Oh, my God!

720
01:03:52,528 --> 01:03:56,281
L.G., they got you, too?

721
01:03:56,449 --> 01:03:58,033
Oh, L.G.!

723
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:04,539
We gotta get y'all loose.

725
01:04:43,996 --> 01:04:47,165
I guess I'm falling apart on you, honey.

727
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:55,549
No.

728
01:04:57,009 --> 01:04:59,427
No.

730
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,768
Shit.

733
01:05:56,819 --> 01:05:58,153
L.G.

734
01:06:00,239 --> 01:06:02,115
I love you.

736
01:06:21,385 --> 01:06:22,636
So he says,

737
01:06:22,803 --> 01:06:27,057
"Hey, get me those lawyers.
Legal meat."

738
01:06:27,224 --> 01:06:29,643
- Legal meat, yeah!
- Bubba, you idiot!

739
01:06:29,810 --> 01:06:31,436
Get your ass over here.

740
01:06:31,604 --> 01:06:33,855
- You fucked up again.
- You fucked up again.

741
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,399
He says,
"Hey, get me those lawyers.

742
01:06:36,567 --> 01:06:38,318
Legal meat, y'all."

743
01:06:38,486 --> 01:06:41,905
Fuck me in the left eye! 

744
01:06:42,073 --> 01:06:46,117
Valuable kill-time wasted running down
them coked-up pencil necks,

745
01:06:46,285 --> 01:06:48,703
and not a good chop on the whole bunch.

746
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:50,830
I pick the vittles. Get it?

747
01:06:50,998 --> 01:06:53,833
- I. Me. Nobody but...
- I pick the vittles, I.

748
01:06:54,001 --> 01:06:56,670
- Bubba, you hull wreckage!
- Me. Nobody but...

749
01:06:56,837 --> 01:07:01,091
Busted again, huh?
That's the main support beam.

751
01:07:03,886 --> 01:07:07,430
Fuck, you idiots! You both will pay!

752
01:07:07,598 --> 01:07:09,557
Both of you... You're both...

753
01:07:09,725 --> 01:07:13,061
Look what your brother's done now.
You coon shit.

754
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:17,524
You cut the main support beam.
And this is what happens.

755
01:07:17,692 --> 01:07:19,901
Of course this is what happens.

756
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,904
That big brute!

757
01:07:23,072 --> 01:07:24,906
Dirty meat don't cut it.

758
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:28,660
Family standards only require
the best meat in town.

759
01:07:28,828 --> 01:07:30,412
More money lost.

760
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:33,415
I never, never, never get a break.

761
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,917
Work, work night and day,

762
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:39,462
presenting myself to the people,
selling, selling.

763
01:07:39,630 --> 01:07:44,342
You pair of prima donnas fooling around
here and listening to the radio all day

764
01:07:44,510 --> 01:07:47,637
and sawing down your own house.

765
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:57,022
Take it all down!

766
01:07:57,189 --> 01:07:59,441
Bring it all down!

767
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:01,943
Bury the devil!

768
01:08:05,322 --> 01:08:11,036
May the Lord have mercy on our souls!
Ah!

769
01:08:12,872 --> 01:08:15,790
Get that thing out of here.

770
01:08:15,958 --> 01:08:19,461
Maybe it cracked the main butane tank.

771
01:08:19,628 --> 01:08:22,630
It's up there. Go look at it.

772
01:08:22,798 --> 01:08:25,341
Taxes. Taxes.

773
01:08:25,509 --> 01:08:28,303
Damn property taxes fuck up everything.

774
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:32,140
Crooks don't pay taxes.
Politicians don't.

775
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,309
Movie stars don't.

776
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:39,731
It's the little guy that can't make
a dime. He pays the taxes.

777
01:08:39,899 --> 01:08:42,484
Small businessman
gets it in the ass every time.

778
01:08:42,651 --> 01:08:44,527
I ought to quit.

779
01:08:44,695 --> 01:08:48,490
Right, it's junk. Quit.
Dump this cook show.

780
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:52,827
Sell off this turkey.
It's time. It's in the air.

781
01:08:52,995 --> 01:08:54,788
It's what the public wants.

782
01:08:54,955 --> 01:08:56,790
I don't wanna hear that again.

783
01:08:56,957 --> 01:08:59,250
It's 'Nam Land!

785
01:09:03,464 --> 01:09:06,633
Yow! What the hell was that?

786
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:10,512
I don't know, boy.
It looked like a big, big fireball.

788
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:20,897
'Nam Land.

789
01:09:22,358 --> 01:09:23,733
Napalm.

790
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:26,861
Fire in the hole.

791
01:09:32,368 --> 01:09:35,370
That's the main butane tank
up there, Bubba.

792
01:09:35,538 --> 01:09:38,998
Go look at it.
Get your butt moving, boy.

793
01:09:39,166 --> 01:09:42,710
Go up there and look at it.
Go look at it.

794
01:09:42,878 --> 01:09:46,297
- I'll kick you in the ass again.
- Not now. It's 'Nam Land.

795
01:09:46,465 --> 01:09:49,801
- It's a hit. It's a bang. It's a smash.
- Shut him up, Bubba.

796
01:10:01,522 --> 01:10:03,731
Did you see it?

797
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:05,775
Well, did you? Didn't you?

798
01:10:05,943 --> 01:10:08,236
Did you? Didn't you?

799
01:10:08,404 --> 01:10:10,947
Go check it out, boy.

800
01:10:11,115 --> 01:10:14,951
- 'Nam Land!
- Oh, shut up!

801
01:10:15,119 --> 01:10:17,829
I told you to go check it out, boy,
before I start kicking your ass.

802
01:10:17,997 --> 01:10:22,000
Some kind of crazy booger
just skipped through here.

803
01:10:22,168 --> 01:10:25,170
No, a booger? How big?

804
01:10:25,337 --> 01:10:29,799
A big crazy booger.
Let's haul butt, bro.

805
01:10:53,574 --> 01:10:55,200
Oh, my God.

806
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:03,124
Oh, God.

807
01:11:15,387 --> 01:11:16,846
Franklin.

808
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:37,992
Don't you cry, my brother.

809
01:11:40,371 --> 01:11:45,833
I'm here now.

810
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,920
They can't do this.

811
01:11:49,088 --> 01:11:51,547
They can't do this!

812
01:11:51,715 --> 01:11:55,802
They can't do this! They can't do this!

813
01:12:04,979 --> 01:12:07,897
I'll take you back to hell!

814
01:12:08,065 --> 01:12:10,566
I'll take you to hell!

821
01:14:30,624 --> 01:14:32,667
All right, all right!

822
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:36,712
Let's talk about it.

823
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:39,257
OK. What, are you pissed-off?
What about me?

824
01:14:39,425 --> 01:14:42,969
Listen, this is not gonna work out.

825
01:14:45,597 --> 01:14:49,058
I'm trying to be open with you. It's
nobody's fault. I just can't do this.

826
01:14:53,522 --> 01:14:59,402
Let me go.

827
01:14:59,570 --> 01:15:03,739
What the hell's going on here?

828
01:15:07,161 --> 01:15:08,661
Bubba, you nap-haired idiot.

829
01:15:08,829 --> 01:15:10,538
Get out of here.

830
01:15:13,333 --> 01:15:16,919
Who's this? I get it.

831
01:15:17,087 --> 01:15:21,299
Are you the saboteur
that's fucking up our house?

832
01:15:21,467 --> 01:15:23,301
Trying to put me out of business?

833
01:15:23,469 --> 01:15:25,720
Thousands of dollars lost.

834
01:15:25,888 --> 01:15:28,723
You got that kind of money? No!

835
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:33,352
It's the deejay. My fave.

836
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,563
That dirty thing?

837
01:15:35,731 --> 01:15:37,523
Told me you boys got her.

838
01:15:37,691 --> 01:15:39,692
Well, yeah.

839
01:15:39,860 --> 01:15:42,528
Leatherface killed her
once already tonight.

840
01:15:42,696 --> 01:15:46,115
But look, she's red-faced.

841
01:15:46,283 --> 01:15:50,077
Bubba's been playing with her.
Bubba likes her.

842
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:52,914
Bubba's got a girlfriend.

843
01:15:53,081 --> 01:15:59,795
Bubba's got a girlfriend!
Bubba's got a girlfriend!

844
01:15:59,963 --> 01:16:03,257
Bubba's got a girl...

845
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:05,551
Is that what this is, Bubba?

846
01:16:05,719 --> 01:16:08,554
The old cock-and-cunt swindle, huh?

847
01:16:08,722 --> 01:16:12,183
S-C-E-X. Sex.

848
01:16:12,351 --> 01:16:15,186
And you had to find out about it,
didn't you?

849
01:16:15,354 --> 01:16:17,313
You just couldn't leave it alone.

850
01:16:17,481 --> 01:16:20,191
If you wanted to know about it so bad,
why didn't you ask me?

851
01:16:20,359 --> 01:16:23,152
You wanna know about it?
You wanna know about it?

852
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:25,613
Ask me. Ask me.

853
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:29,784
It's a swindle, that's all.
So don't get mixed up in it.

854
01:16:29,952 --> 01:16:32,620
Help me. Help me.

855
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,288
Help me.

856
01:16:34,456 --> 01:16:36,290
Please, help me. Please.

857
01:16:36,458 --> 01:16:37,625
Help me.

858
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:39,919
Please, help me.

859
01:16:43,131 --> 01:16:46,467
All right, Miss Priss, cut that out.

860
01:16:46,635 --> 01:16:48,219
Leave him alone, damn it!

861
01:16:50,806 --> 01:16:54,642
Bubba, you were supposed to finish her.
Finish her now.

862
01:16:57,813 --> 01:16:59,689
- Burn her like a rat.
- Finish her.

863
01:16:59,856 --> 01:17:01,482
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now.

864
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:05,194
Burn her like a rat!
Burn her like a rat, rat, rat!

865
01:17:05,362 --> 01:17:07,947
- Burn her like a rat!
- Finish her now!

866
01:17:08,115 --> 01:17:09,657
- Finish her now, Bubba!
- Burn her like a rat!

867
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:11,826
- Finish her!
- Finish her. Finish her.

868
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:16,664
Give me that.

869
01:17:16,832 --> 01:17:20,626
Turn traitor for a piece of tail.

870
01:17:20,794 --> 01:17:25,506
You got one choice, boy,
sex or the saw.

871
01:17:25,674 --> 01:17:28,759
Sex is, well, nobody knows.

872
01:17:28,927 --> 01:17:32,888
But the saw, the saw is family.

873
01:17:33,056 --> 01:17:37,018
- The saw is family.
- Wait till Granddad hears about this.

874
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:42,023
Take her away.

875
01:17:44,484 --> 01:17:47,194
- She's in the garbage now.
- Oh, no.

876
01:17:48,697 --> 01:17:51,073
- Oh, no.
- A-one...

877
01:17:52,534 --> 01:17:53,826
...and a-two...

878
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:56,912
...and a-three!

879
01:18:08,342 --> 01:18:10,718
No!

880
01:18:15,766 --> 01:18:18,392
Dinnertime, damn it! Let's go.

881
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,895
Eat and run. Eat and run.

882
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:24,440
There's a lot of hungry
football fans to feed.

883
01:18:24,608 --> 01:18:28,027
Hurry it up. Grandpa likes to go fast.

884
01:18:28,195 --> 01:18:31,489
He always did. Come on. Come on.

885
01:18:31,657 --> 01:18:34,408
Time eats money.

886
01:18:34,576 --> 01:18:39,080
Those damn coon shits
are the weight of the family.

887
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:44,085
I stoop my shoulders
taking care of my younger brothers.

888
01:18:44,252 --> 01:18:48,172
It squashed the young years
out of my life

889
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:51,092
like a can of cheese whip.

890
01:18:52,803 --> 01:18:55,346
I wouldn't wish this rotten life

891
01:18:55,514 --> 01:18:59,850
off on a one-eyed ferret with mange.

892
01:19:00,018 --> 01:19:04,146
You're the first girl
Bubba's brought home to dinner.

893
01:19:04,314 --> 01:19:06,691
This is a real special occasion.

894
01:19:06,858 --> 01:19:10,069
Grandpa sure looks forward
to meeting you.

895
01:19:10,237 --> 01:19:14,281
He's 137 years old
but still as fast as Jesse James,

896
01:19:14,449 --> 01:19:16,450
so don't you worry none.

897
01:19:16,618 --> 01:19:18,327
Here comes Grandpa now.

898
01:19:18,495 --> 01:19:20,871
God bless you, Grandpa.

899
01:19:21,039 --> 01:19:24,583
It's playtime!
It's dinnertime!

900
01:19:24,751 --> 01:19:27,420
Your little boys
have some left here for you.

901
01:19:27,587 --> 01:19:29,839
Yes, no, yes, no!
Yes, we do!

902
01:19:30,006 --> 01:19:33,050
We love you!
We love you!

903
01:19:35,512 --> 01:19:38,556
OK, now. Take it easy, now.
Take it easy with Grandpa.

904
01:19:38,724 --> 01:19:40,891
- That's right. That's right.
- Get him over here easy, now.

905
01:19:41,059 --> 01:19:42,059
- That's right. OK.
- Come on, you boys.

906
01:19:42,227 --> 01:19:45,229
Easy with Grandpa, now.

907
01:19:45,397 --> 01:19:47,314
- Easy with Grandpa.
- No! No!

908
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,483
Oh, please, no.

909
01:19:49,651 --> 01:19:53,154
Don't rattle him like that, damn it!

910
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,489
You're balling up his shit.

911
01:19:58,368 --> 01:19:59,326
No!

912
01:19:59,494 --> 01:20:03,914
Grandpa's strict liquid diet
keeps him as fresh as a rose.

913
01:20:04,082 --> 01:20:05,249
Every spring,

914
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:10,713
the Atlas Rendering Company used to
throw a big barbecue for Grandpa.

915
01:20:10,881 --> 01:20:12,840
He was the master.

916
01:20:13,008 --> 01:20:14,842
He was the one and only.

917
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,012
He showed us all the business.

918
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:21,557
We was raised in meat. 

919
01:20:21,725 --> 01:20:25,853
But then after the glory,
here comes the shame.

920
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:28,314
Atlas went for automation.

921
01:20:28,482 --> 01:20:30,941
The electrified cages,

922
01:20:31,109 --> 01:20:32,735
the cold-steel chutes,

923
01:20:32,903 --> 01:20:35,029
the air-powered head hammers.

924
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:38,949
That drove Grandpa crazy,
seeing things done like that.

925
01:20:39,117 --> 01:20:41,494
Let me go! Let me go!

926
01:20:41,661 --> 01:20:45,956
No, no, that's all right. That's all
right. It'll be over soon.

927
01:20:47,459 --> 01:20:52,213
Get the hammer.

928
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:55,257
The crunching and the grinding,

929
01:20:55,425 --> 01:20:57,885
he just couldn't stand it, no way.

930
01:20:58,053 --> 01:21:00,387
So that was all she wrote.

931
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:04,391
One morning, Grandpa just quit going in.

932
01:21:04,559 --> 01:21:06,227
It was the shame.

933
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:09,814
It was the shame. The shame.

934
01:21:11,525 --> 01:21:13,943
There's more work to do.
Let's get on with it.

935
01:21:14,110 --> 01:21:16,487
Right. Let's get on with it. Bingo!

936
01:21:16,655 --> 01:21:20,199
Give me that.
Get that tub over there in a hurry.

937
01:21:20,367 --> 01:21:23,661
Do I have to do every damn thing
around here?

938
01:21:23,829 --> 01:21:26,455
You just sit tight.

939
01:21:27,415 --> 01:21:30,584
Bubba, she's ready. Bring her on down.

940
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,629
No!

941
01:21:35,757 --> 01:21:38,843
- Oh, no!
- Bring her on down, damn it!

942
01:21:39,010 --> 01:21:41,512
No! No!

943
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:44,139
Bring her on down!

944
01:21:44,307 --> 01:21:47,768
No! No, no, no!

945
01:21:47,936 --> 01:21:49,937
No, no, no!

946
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:55,609
Help me! No, no, no!

947
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:59,446
Let me go! You gotta let me go!
Let me go! Please, help me!

948
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:02,032
- This will be one you won't forget.
- Please, help me!

949
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,118
It's a real honor.

950
01:22:04,286 --> 01:22:06,829
Grandpa, he's a one-hitter.

951
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:10,541
And it's just like going home.

952
01:22:10,709 --> 01:22:13,460
Please help me!

953
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:16,922
- No! No! No, God!
- No, no.

954
01:22:17,090 --> 01:22:20,926
Help me! Let me go!

955
01:22:21,094 --> 01:22:23,429
Let me go! Let me go!

956
01:22:23,597 --> 01:22:25,556
Help me, please!

957
01:22:26,308 --> 01:22:27,975
Please, help me!

958
01:22:28,143 --> 01:22:30,477
Let's go see Grandpa, boy.

959
01:22:30,645 --> 01:22:32,313
No, don't!

960
01:22:38,236 --> 01:22:41,822
- No! No, God!
- Come on. Bring the bitch down.

962
01:22:43,158 --> 01:22:44,575
No! No!

963
01:22:44,743 --> 01:22:46,744
No, no, let me go!

964
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,996
Let me go!

965
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,540
Let me go! No! No!

966
01:22:51,708 --> 01:22:53,918
No, no, no!

967
01:22:55,462 --> 01:22:56,420
No!

968
01:22:56,588 --> 01:23:00,424
Here come the judge.
Here come the judge.

969
01:23:00,592 --> 01:23:01,550
No!

970
01:23:01,718 --> 01:23:04,595
Now, don't ruin Grandpa's favorite rug.

971
01:23:04,763 --> 01:23:08,974
Be careful of the splatter.
You gotta be careful of the splatter.

972
01:23:09,142 --> 01:23:14,563
- Great-grandma in chainsaw heaven...
- No! No! God!

973
01:23:14,731 --> 01:23:17,024
...please don't hoodoo the boy.

974
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:20,110
Hey, Grandpa, here's the big boy.

975
01:23:20,278 --> 01:23:22,738
Look what Bubba brought you.

976
01:23:22,906 --> 01:23:26,325
Hey, Grandpa, Bubba's got
something to show you here.

977
01:23:26,493 --> 01:23:29,536
Look, a Slurpee booty. 

978
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:31,455
- Hit her, Grandpa.
- Come on, Grandpa.

979
01:23:31,623 --> 01:23:33,999
Let's see you do it. Now, come on.
Come on, Grandpa. You're the best.

980
01:23:34,167 --> 01:23:36,293
- Hit her, Grandpa. Hit her!
- Come on. Hit her, Grandpa.

981
01:23:36,461 --> 01:23:38,045
Come on, I'm telling you...

982
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:40,923
Remember those thieves?
Come on. One-hitter.

983
01:23:41,091 --> 01:23:43,008
- Come on, Grandpa.
- Hit her. Hit her, Grandpa.

984
01:23:43,176 --> 01:23:45,386
Come on, you won't miss her.

986
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:54,645
Come on, Grandpa.

987
01:23:54,813 --> 01:23:57,648
Hit her. Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch.

988
01:23:57,816 --> 01:24:00,359
Come on, Grandpa.

989
01:24:05,240 --> 01:24:08,200
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.

990
01:24:08,368 --> 01:24:10,703
Come on, there, Grandpa.
Come on, there, Grandpa.

991
01:24:10,870 --> 01:24:13,914
Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
You're the best.

992
01:24:14,082 --> 01:24:16,583
Hit that bitch, Grandpa. Hit her.

993
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:23,799
Come on, Grandpa. Hit her.
You are, Grandpa. You're the best.

994
01:24:24,426 --> 01:24:28,012
Yeah! That's good, isn't it, Grandpa?

996
01:24:32,017 --> 01:24:33,267
Grandpa!

997
01:24:34,853 --> 01:24:36,979
- Attaboy, Grandpa.
- Hit that bitch, now, Grandpa.

998
01:24:37,147 --> 01:24:40,399
- Come on, Grandpa. You can do it.
- Get her now, Grandpa. You can do it.

999
01:24:40,567 --> 01:24:42,026
Come on, Grandpa.

1000
01:24:44,487 --> 01:24:46,613

No! No! No! No!

1002

No! No!

1003
01:24:54,122 --> 01:24:57,166
Hit that bitch. Hit that bitch!

1004
01:24:57,333 --> 01:25:05,299
Come on, Grandpa!

1005
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:10,095
Oh, Grandpa, let's get on with it.

1006

What the hell's going on here?

1023
01:26:21,793 --> 01:26:26,213
Is that the American way of entering
a man's home, singing like that?

1024
01:26:27,382 --> 01:26:31,176
I get it.
The old pressure game, huh?

1025
01:26:31,344 --> 01:26:36,640
Boys, you never
should have been doing this.

1026
01:26:36,808 --> 01:26:40,727
Who sent you?
Those sissies over at Del-Mar Catering?

1027
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:45,232
That chickenshit Burrito-Man bunch?


1028
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,069
Well, I don't care, you hear?
Yeah, that's right.

1029
01:26:49,237 --> 01:26:50,904
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

1030
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:55,242
And from where I sit,
there just ain't enough damn dogs.

1031
01:26:55,410 --> 01:26:58,912
If you can't stand the heat,
get out of the damn kitchen.

1032
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:04,835
How much, huh?
Let's make a deal right here.

1033
01:27:05,003 --> 01:27:07,421
Real cash money.

1034
01:27:07,589 --> 01:27:10,924
Just you and me, huh?
I don't care who sent you.

1035
01:27:11,092 --> 01:27:13,510
I'm the Lord of the Harvest.

1036
01:27:13,678 --> 01:27:17,264
Who's that?
Some new health-food bunch?

1037
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:20,684
Come on. Come on.

1038
01:27:20,852 --> 01:27:23,353
Is there any money in it,
you wanna know?

1039
01:27:23,521 --> 01:27:26,273
Yeah, right here.
How much? How much?

1040
01:27:31,321 --> 01:27:34,615
- Lefty.
- Sister.

1041
01:27:35,825 --> 01:27:37,409
Lefty!

1042
01:27:38,786 --> 01:27:40,162
Brazos!

1044
01:27:52,050 --> 01:27:54,134
Run, sister. Run.

1047
01:29:29,230 --> 01:29:32,065
Small businessman that...

1048
01:29:32,233 --> 01:29:35,360
...always, always, always
gets it in the ass!

1049
01:29:38,698 --> 01:29:42,576
Sure... Sure took care of my hems.

1050
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:44,870
Saved a trip to the hospital.

1051
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:52,085
Ah. Looks... Looks bad.

1052
01:29:52,253 --> 01:29:55,839
Sure burned my beans bad on that one.

1055
01:30:31,959 --> 01:30:35,128
Maybe it's time to just shut down.

1056
01:30:35,296 --> 01:30:37,964
Time to shut down the show, yeah.

1057
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:41,385
Yeah, pull the plug.
Come here, nubbins.

1058
01:30:46,599 --> 01:30:50,060
Where...
Where's that old "Fuck you, Charlie"?

1062
01:31:21,008 --> 01:31:26,179
That little "Just in case, baby"?

1063
01:31:26,347 --> 01:31:28,140
Where'd you put it?

1064
01:31:28,307 --> 01:31:31,101
Ah! Yeah, there it is.

1065
01:31:31,269 --> 01:31:36,440
Man... Man builds a good, sturdy trade

1066
01:31:36,607 --> 01:31:39,067
by hooking and crooking.

1067
01:31:40,236 --> 01:31:42,529
And then, kerplooey!

1068
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:45,782
The gods just kick him
right in the balls.

1069
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:50,454
Oh, no, not this time.

1072
01:32:02,717 --> 01:32:04,509
No! No!

1074
01:32:14,479 --> 01:32:17,063
Ah!

1076
01:32:37,752 --> 01:32:41,254
I got the last laugh right here.

1079
01:32:50,348 --> 01:32:53,183
Ah!

1083
01:33:02,401 --> 01:33:04,194
Going down, now!

1086
01:33:52,952 --> 01:33:54,619
Going down! Going down, now!

1087
01:34:01,419 --> 01:34:03,837
Whoa!

1089
01:34:55,222 --> 01:34:57,891
Here I come, you hog bitch!

1090
01:34:58,559 --> 01:35:01,686
You hog bitch!

1091
01:35:01,854 --> 01:35:05,065
Dead end, girl. Dead end now.

1092
01:35:08,027 --> 01:35:10,362
Dead-end city.

1093
01:35:14,158 --> 01:35:15,867
Look at my face.

1094
01:35:16,035 --> 01:35:19,245
Look. Look!

1095
01:35:30,716 --> 01:35:34,803
It's like death eating
a cracker, isn't it? Huh?

1096
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:35,804
Huh?!

1097
01:35:45,690 --> 01:35:46,690
No!

1098
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:50,110
Get away from her! Get away!

1099
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:52,779
Don't touch her! No!

1100
01:35:54,031 --> 01:35:54,989
Grandma!

1101
01:35:55,157 --> 01:35:57,409
No!

1102
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:00,495
Grandma! Grandma!

1103
01:36:00,663 --> 01:36:07,419
Grandma!

1104
01:36:13,926 --> 01:36:17,929
You killed her, you hog bitch!

1107
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:43,496
