1
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,329
The Partanna baby. My baby.

2
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:48,883
Angelo, my oldest, dearest friend...

3
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:53,262
your son, he lost his mother...

4
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:57,475
but he's got another father.
I'm his father now, with you.

5
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:01,645
I will be as one with you...

6
00:01:02,188 --> 00:01:05,149
protecting his future. Yeah.

7
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,403
We are honored, Don Corrado.

8
00:01:53,197 --> 00:01:55,866
Raise the first finger of your right hand.

9
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,322
This drop of blood...

10
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:39,201
symbolizes your birth into our family.

11
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,122
We are one until death.

12
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,376
We protect you...

13
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,921
so must you protect Prizzi honor.

14
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:55,634
- Do you swear it?
- Yes.

15
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:04,318
Now that you have sealed
a truly Christian marriage...

16
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:07,696
give these wedding rings to each other,
saying after me:

17
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:12,701
"In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit...

18
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,871
"take and wear this ring...

19
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,873
"as a sign of my love...

20
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:20,042
"and fidelity."

21
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,337
"In the name of the Father...

22
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,172
"and of the Son...

23
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:27,090
"and of the Holy Spirit...

24
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,343
"take and wear this ring...

25
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:31,595
"as a sign of my love...

26
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,847
"and fidelity.

27
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:38,519
"In the name of the Father, and of the Son,
and of the Holy Spirit, amen."

28
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,000
Fella, watch it.

29
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,002
See that girl up there? The blonde?

30
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,463
In lavender, the gloves?

31
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:50,299
Look, pal, I'd like to help you.

32
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:53,635
But I got to take shots of the notables,
the bishops, commissioners.

33
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:55,804
Do you want something?
What can I do for you?

34
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,057
I want some shots of that woman up there
in the lavender--

35
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,101
You got it. My pleasure.

36
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,020
Yeah? Okay, here.

37
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:06,064
Take care of yourselves.

38
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,485
- Don't tell me that was Charley Partanna?
- Himself.

39
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,112
Holy shit!

40
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:34,926
Give me a ride over to the reception.

41
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:38,472
It's worth a half a dozen veal steaks
on the Prizzi meat company.

42
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,682
You got it, Charley. Jump in.

43
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,599
<i>Okay, quiet down.</i>

44
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,477
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

45
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:27,396
<i>my brother, Eduardo and I...</i>

46
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:32,192
<i>want to introduce you to a man
who needs no introduction...</i>

47
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,320
<i>our father, your dear friend...</i>

48
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:38,156
<i>a legend to his people...</i>

49
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,034
<i>Don Corrado Prizzi.</i>

50
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,594
<i>My father welcomes all of you
to this great family occasion.</i>

51
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,222
<i>He said that you should have a good time.</i>

52
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:06,685
<i>He offers his toast of love
to the happiness of the bride and groom...</i>

53
00:12:07,018 --> 00:12:09,396
<i>and he wishes them many children.</i>

54
00:13:03,533 --> 00:13:06,828
Excuse me. Would you care to dance?

55
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:10,248
Yes.

56
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:40,153
Some spread, huh?

57
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:43,323
Haven't I seen you before?

58
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,951
I'm sure I'd remember.

59
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:51,581
I mean, maybe you went to Marymount
with the bride or something.

60
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,126
Could never miss you.

61
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:56,670
And you are?

62
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:59,673
Charley Partanna. Pleased to meet you.

63
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:02,384
Miss! Telephone, lady.

64
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:05,011
- Telephone?
<i>- I'll</i> be right back.

65
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,366
Hello, Aunt Amalia.

66
00:14:29,202 --> 00:14:32,080
<i>Maerose, figlia mia!</i>

67
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:35,542
Papa actually invited me
to my own sister's wedding.

68
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,085
Imagine that.

69
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:40,088
He must be getting soft in his old age.

70
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,424
Cara, let me look at you.

71
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:48,847
- So, Aunt Amalia, what do you think?
- Such a one, you are.

72
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,308
Always making a show of yourself.

73
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,020
Come on, Aunt Amalia,
I got a reputation to live up to.

74
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:57,105
I'm the family scandal.

75
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:59,983
Everybody would be disappointed
if I stopped.

76
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,862
Have you paid your respects
to your father yet?

77
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:12,954
Do I have to?

78
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:16,249
Sure, you have to.
Come on, let's go together.

79
00:15:23,632 --> 00:15:25,008
Hello, Papa.

80
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:30,263
She came to pay her respects. Speak to her.

81
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:33,600
Then how come she ain't dressed right?

82
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,769
If she's so respectful...

83
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,980
how come she shows up
at a family wedding...

84
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,483
<i>dressed like</i> a <i>puttana diavolo?</i>

85
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,820
Don't worry, Aunt Amalia,
he'll get his one day.

86
00:15:47,113 --> 00:15:49,616
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

87
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:28,154
Kid.

88
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,076
Where's the lady you took to the telephone?

89
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,373
How should I know, mister?

90
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:42,002
- Who told you to go get her?
- Some old guy, I don't know.

91
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,047
Okay, here.

92
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,052
- Watch out for them cannolis, there.
- Thanks, mister.

93
00:16:53,972 --> 00:16:55,515
Hello, Charley.

94
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,642
- Hi, Maerose.
- Hi.

95
00:16:58,143 --> 00:17:01,312
- How are you, Mae?
- Fine, Charley. You?

96
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:03,982
I'm fine, too.

97
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,114
- How's the decorating business?
- It's just great, Charley.

98
00:17:11,656 --> 00:17:14,284
We're always busy.
Everything is art deco now.

99
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,368
Art who?

100
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:18,413
Charley, art deco.
You know, after art nouveau.

101
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,623
It's a style. It's not a person.

102
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:25,128
You know, it's like all that Erte stuff.

103
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:33,887
Goddamn!

104
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,724
What's the matter, Mae?

105
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,770
I should have known to stay away.

106
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,646
What happened?

107
00:17:45,356 --> 00:17:48,693
I went to say hello to my father.
He called me a whore.

108
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,031
I'm sorry.

109
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:59,454
Listen, Mae, what you got to do
is forget about your father.

110
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,122
Forget about the environment.

111
00:18:01,206 --> 00:18:04,042
They're never gonna take you back anyway,
so screw them.

112
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,960
They don't deserve you.

113
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:10,298
Especially that fucking Dominic.

114
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,512
Mae, you're still beautiful.

115
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:20,433
Why don't you find yourself someone
who has nothing to do with the families?

116
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,976
Settle down...

117
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:24,604
have a couple of kids, a life.

118
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,442
Practice your meatballs.

119
00:18:32,153 --> 00:18:35,031
Sure, Charley. Thanks a hell of a lot.

120
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,367
You're a big help.

121
00:18:57,262 --> 00:18:59,681
- Are you the guy that took the pictures?
- Yeah.

122
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,017
<i>- So when</i> do I <i>get to see them?
- They're in the lab, Mr. Partanna.</i>

123
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:06,271
<i>I'll get them to you as soon as they're out,
about noon tomorrow.</i>

124
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:09,399
- Okay, meanwhile, give me her name.
- Her <i>name?</i>

125
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,193
Yeah, the name. Her name, for Christ's sake.

126
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:16,197
<i>Jesus, Mr. Partanna, I didn't get no name.
I thought you knew her.</i>

127
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,032
For Christ's sake...

128
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,720
<i>- Hello?
- Mae?</i>

129
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:41,347
<i>She ain't here.</i>

130
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:45,018
- Do you <i>want</i> to leave a message?
- Who is this?

131
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,895
This is the girl.

132
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:50,231
Ask her, and this is very important...

133
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:53,735
ask her if she knows a woman
at the wedding...

134
00:19:53,818 --> 00:19:55,695
who wore a lavender dress.

135
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:59,282
<i>- You got it?
- Yeah, I got it.</i>

136
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:01,910
Make sure she calls me, you hear?

137
00:20:02,493 --> 00:20:05,997
Now, tell me your name,
and I'm gonna send you $10.

138
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:07,665
$10?

139
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,293
This is Miss Peaches.

140
00:20:10,543 --> 00:20:12,045
Okay, Peaches.

141
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,590
Now, you tell Miss Prizzi
she has to call me...

142
00:20:15,673 --> 00:20:18,509
- no matter how late, tonight.
<i>- Okay.</i>

143
00:20:18,676 --> 00:20:21,596
Okay, Peaches. Thank you. Bye.

144
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:46,955
Gallagher, Homicide.

145
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:49,832
What's up?

146
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,169
Somebody tagged Sal Netturbino
this afternoon.

147
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:55,630
Yeah? Who done it?

148
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:59,008
Where were you
between 2:00 and 5:00 today?

149
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,222
I was at the wedding,
Corrado Prizzi's granddaughter's wedding.

150
00:21:06,224 --> 00:21:09,769
What did I tell you? They're all gonna
turn out to be at the wedding.

151
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,021
Come on, we're taking you in.

152
00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,120
You couldn't be cleaner, right?

153
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:29,664
- Who made the hit, Pop?
- We did.

154
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:33,459
We did? How come we did?
I don't know nothing about it.

155
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:42,010
That's the best way, ain't it?

156
00:21:43,011 --> 00:21:44,262
Who hit him?

157
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,015
Out-of-town talent. It was a specialist job.

158
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,349
How come?

159
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:52,145
Dominic told me to set it up
so we couldn't have nothing to do with it.

160
00:21:52,228 --> 00:21:54,230
We was all at the wedding.

161
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:11,164
<i>You have any luck?</i>

162
00:22:12,165 --> 00:22:14,292
What kind of message was that?

163
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:17,295
Who can remember
a girl in a lavender dress?

164
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:20,214
I was wearing a pink and black dress.

165
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:24,218
So you don't know who she is?

166
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:29,223
The woman in the lavender dress?

167
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,809
Go soak your head.

168
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,238
Yeah?

169
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:47,325
<i>Mr. Partanna, please.
It's Irene Walker calling.</i>

170
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:49,786
- <i>What?
- Is this Charley Partanna?</i>

171
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:51,120
Yeah.

172
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,499
I hope you don't mind my calling so late.

173
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:58,586
I just wanted to apologize
for running out the way I did this afternoon.

174
00:22:58,669 --> 00:23:01,464
This is you? Irene Walker?

175
00:23:03,383 --> 00:23:06,928
I recognize the voice,
but I didn't get your name before.

176
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:11,224
I just wanted to explain.
I hope you don't think I'm rude.

177
00:23:11,349 --> 00:23:13,059
Rude? No.

178
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:15,436
You could never be rude.

179
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,980
Say, listen...

180
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:23,277
why don't we get together later,
like for a late dinner?

181
00:23:23,653 --> 00:23:27,657
<i>- When? You mean tonight?
- I could pick you up, like, in half an hour.</i>

182
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,534
But I'm in California.

183
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:33,454
<i>- California?
- That's where I live. I had to come home.</i>

184
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,129
How about lunch tomorrow?

185
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,381
All right.

186
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:47,218
How about the bar at the Bel Age Hotel?

187
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:51,764
That would be tremendous. What time?

188
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,392
- About 2:00?
- Great.

189
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:23,045
I was scared
I was never gonna see you again.

190
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:40,271
- What was that you said?
- I ordered us a drink.

191
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:42,565
Something I think you'll like.

192
00:24:42,857 --> 00:24:44,150
Say it again.

193
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,698
What is it?
Something Puerto Rican or something?

194
00:24:50,781 --> 00:24:52,742
Yes, I guess it could be.

195
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,119
Pineapple juice with rum.

196
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,121
I had it in Cuba.

197
00:24:58,915 --> 00:25:01,000
What were you doing in Cuba?

198
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:03,544
I was on my honeymoon.

199
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:09,800
I didn't know you was married.

200
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:12,595
My husband left me four years ago.

201
00:25:13,221 --> 00:25:16,057
I don't know where he is.
I don't want to know.

202
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,934
He left you?

203
00:25:19,227 --> 00:25:20,394
Crazy, huh?

204
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,774
I could find him for you.

205
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:27,443
Let him stay lost.

206
00:25:31,531 --> 00:25:34,408
You might want
to get married again someday.

207
00:25:35,243 --> 00:25:36,327
Maybe.

208
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:41,374
But until that happens,
I guess I don't want to know about him.

209
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,504
What about you? Are you married?

210
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,093
Once, I was almost married.

211
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,096
Maerose was her name.

212
00:25:56,722 --> 00:25:58,474
We grew up together.

213
00:26:01,561 --> 00:26:03,771
One night, we had a big fight...

214
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:06,524
because I was dancing too much
with this other girl.

215
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:10,736
I suppose I did it on purpose,
because I wanted to make her jealous.

216
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,741
So she flew off to Mexico with a guy...

217
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,702
shacked up in a hotel.

218
00:26:17,785 --> 00:26:21,330
Her father sent some goons down there
to clobber the guy.

219
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:28,754
Brings her back to the States,
then he don't let her in back into his house.

220
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:30,798
That was four years ago.

221
00:26:31,549 --> 00:26:33,050
And that's it?

222
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:36,304
You know, she can't even
go to Brooklyn anymore...

223
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:40,391
unless it's a special occasion.
Weddings, funerals, stuff like that.

224
00:26:41,726 --> 00:26:43,269
We're still friends.

225
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:49,191
She's a decorator. She did my apartment.
Real nice job she did, too.

226
00:26:51,444 --> 00:26:53,654
That's some family you've got.

227
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:56,574
Anyway, I like your coat.

228
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:00,453
Do you?

229
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:06,292
A coat like this
would stand out in New York, you know?

230
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:10,504
My father always says
it's better to stand out...

231
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:14,759
because of how serious you are,
instead of, you know...

232
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:17,678
the clothes, the cars, diamond rings.

233
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:20,806
For men, that is.

234
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:23,559
What am I doing all the talking for here?

235
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:27,855
How come I met you at the Prizzi wedding,
and you ain't no wop?

236
00:27:28,439 --> 00:27:31,108
The bishop who married them wasn't Italian.

237
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:33,694
No, he's a Polack.

238
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:35,529
So am I.

239
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:38,449
Walker is a Polack name?

240
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:41,327
It was Walkiewicz. I shortened it.

241
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:44,330
My maiden name was Maida Walkiewicz.

242
00:27:46,499 --> 00:27:47,792
Either way...

243
00:27:48,918 --> 00:27:51,379
you're sure one beautiful woman to me.

244
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:56,759
I guess I felt that Walker
sounded more like a tax consultant should.

245
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,221
You're a tax consultant?

246
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,182
What do you do when you consult?

247
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:06,727
I save people money. Show them the angles.

248
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,771
There are a lot of angles.

249
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,858
Like this L.A. corporation
had a guy kidnapped in the Middle East.

250
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:17,113
So I told them that the ransom money
was tax-deductible as a theft loss.

251
00:28:17,238 --> 00:28:19,740
- Things like that.
- That's terrific.

252
00:28:21,575 --> 00:28:22,827
Shall we?

253
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:27,248
- Go?
- Yeah, sure.

254
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:29,959
- We'll take my car?
- Okay.

255
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:34,839
- What kind of a car is this?
- An Excalibur.

256
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,925
The Japanese make them in England
for the Arab market.

257
00:28:38,008 --> 00:28:41,762
- It's a great California car.
- It's a great anyplace car.

258
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:44,765
Jesus, it must cost though, huh?

259
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:48,811
It wasn't free,
but think what it will cost in two years.

260
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,856
- Like to eat outside?
- Yeah.

261
00:29:00,781 --> 00:29:03,451
I got to say it, I can't sleep.

262
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,080
I'm a grown man, middle-aged maybe, even.

263
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,583
But nothing...

264
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,502
nobody in my life has ever affected me...

265
00:29:13,586 --> 00:29:17,339
anything like the way that you make me feel.

266
00:29:22,511 --> 00:29:23,846
I love you.

267
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:29,393
That's it. That's everything.

268
00:29:32,062 --> 00:29:33,397
I love you.

269
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,277
I think I'm in love with you, too, Charley.

270
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,655
Not "in love." "In love" is temporary.

271
00:29:42,156 --> 00:29:44,742
Then you move on to the next "in love."

272
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:47,912
Everybody's always falling
in and out of love.

273
00:29:48,537 --> 00:29:49,580
I know this.

274
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:53,626
I remember everything,
I read about it in the magazines.

275
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,505
When you're just "in love," it's just...

276
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:00,591
Wait a minute...

277
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:06,305
a hormonal secretion
which changes the sense of smell...

278
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,517
so as to affect somebody in a certain way.

279
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,020
That's what "in love" is.

280
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,855
Who needs it?

281
00:30:15,397 --> 00:30:16,482
Love?

282
00:30:17,733 --> 00:30:21,487
I mean, I love you, I think.

283
00:30:22,988 --> 00:30:25,282
That sounds like I'm hedging...

284
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,745
but I don't know how to say it,
because I've never said it before.

285
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:33,123
All my life, I've had to protect myself...

286
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:38,254
and you can't protect yourself from anything
when you love somebody.

287
00:30:39,755 --> 00:30:41,507
I love you, Charley.

288
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,096
What's that they're playing?

289
00:30:48,514 --> 00:30:50,516
That's Noche de Ronda.

290
00:30:51,725 --> 00:30:53,686
I'm never gonna forget it.

291
00:30:55,104 --> 00:30:57,606
I'm never gonna forget this dress.

292
00:30:59,275 --> 00:31:02,653
I'm never gonna forget
anything about today.

293
00:31:03,737 --> 00:31:06,657
Wherever we go, whatever it is...

294
00:31:06,824 --> 00:31:09,118
whenever they play this song...

295
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,205
this is gonna be our song.

296
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,415
Everything being...

297
00:31:57,791 --> 00:31:58,876
equal...

298
00:31:59,877 --> 00:32:01,629
would you marry me?

299
00:32:02,087 --> 00:32:04,381
- Everything being equal...
- Yeah.

300
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,136
...I'll marry you, Charley.

301
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,431
Yeah.

302
00:32:44,797 --> 00:32:47,174
Here, have a cigar. Pass them around.

303
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:49,927
- Sure. Yeah, my favorites.
- Thanks.

304
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:53,222
They're really fabulous.

305
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,517
So delicious, very good.

306
00:32:57,017 --> 00:32:59,812
Charley, come in.
You know Cyril Bluestone?

307
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:02,064
- Hello, Charley.
- How are you?

308
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:04,274
Here, you want a cigar, Charley?

309
00:33:05,234 --> 00:33:06,443
Sit down.

310
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:10,406
Now, Cyril, you tell him...

311
00:33:11,824 --> 00:33:15,244
what happened at the big casino,
those dirty bastards.

312
00:33:16,537 --> 00:33:19,873
I've been president of the three
Prizzi casinos in Vegas for 20 years.

313
00:33:19,957 --> 00:33:22,918
And I have never seen a scam
like this before.

314
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,216
I've got 14 phony IOUs here.

315
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:32,720
They come to $722,085.

316
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,056
When the collectors go
to pick up the money...

317
00:33:36,181 --> 00:33:38,308
the player that signed the IOU is dead...

318
00:33:38,392 --> 00:33:41,729
from some bad cold or something,
before he signed the paper...

319
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:44,648
or he was someplace else
and he wasn't in Vegas to sign it.

320
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:48,402
Every piece of paper is countersigned.
That's house rules...

321
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:52,156
by Louis Palo, the acting manager,
and a man in the cage, Marxie Heller.

322
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,616
They had to have been working together.

323
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,201
I don't get it.

324
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:59,997
Louis takes paper to the cage,
all he gets back is chips.

325
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,291
- That's house rules, too.
- Yeah.

326
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:05,002
Now the pit boss tells me
there's a woman in it.

327
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:07,004
He says that he twice saw Louis...

328
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:10,007
bring two big racks of $1,000 plates
to this woman...

329
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,800
and she went to the cashier's window.

330
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,762
He didn't think anything of it at the time.

331
00:34:15,012 --> 00:34:17,306
So where's Louis and Heller?

332
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,976
Louis caught a bullet in the head,
and Heller's holed up in L.A.

333
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,144
He's got a wife out there.

334
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:24,563
They found Louis
across the front seat of his car...

335
00:34:24,646 --> 00:34:28,233
in the parking lot at Presto Ciglione's bar,
way out in the Strip.

336
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:33,572
I knew Louis when he was a helper
on an ice truck 30 years ago.

337
00:34:34,073 --> 00:34:36,033
We taught him his trade.

338
00:34:36,492 --> 00:34:39,620
He wasn't smart enough
to figure a scam like this.

339
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:44,583
So I guess the first thing to do
is find Marxie Heller.

340
00:34:45,042 --> 00:34:48,796
I remember him now.
He always wore a silver toupee on a job.

341
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,298
He had dark brown bags under his eyes...

342
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:54,426
like he was carrying coffee grounds
in them or something.

343
00:34:54,551 --> 00:34:57,513
That's him.
He was good with figures. Steady.

344
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:59,223
But he got TB.

345
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:04,478
Louis Palo was a thief, but he was ours.

346
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:08,315
Heller must have iced him, so you ice Heller.

347
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:17,491
Okay.

348
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,146
What do you want, my friend?

349
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:32,065
The Prizzis sent me.

350
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:36,695
Where's your wife, Mr. Heller?

351
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,740
She's at the supermarket.

352
00:36:40,908 --> 00:36:42,910
And just who are you?

353
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:45,746
Charley Partanna.

354
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,000
Where's the money, Marxie?

355
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,419
"Straight Arrow" Charley.

356
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:55,589
The all-American hood.

357
00:36:57,132 --> 00:36:59,635
I don't know what you're talking about.

358
00:37:00,177 --> 00:37:03,472
Get up on your feet. Come on. Up.

359
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,602
Put your hands up, just spread, that's right.

360
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:22,407
I think you broke my wrist.

361
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:25,077
You won't need it. Come on.

362
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:37,858
I'm home, dear.

363
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:42,362
Marxie's not here, Mrs. Heller.

364
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,009
What are you doing here?

365
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,180
Why didn't you call first?

366
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,432
You always call first.

367
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,441
You're Marxie Heller's wife?

368
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,989
You're married to Marxie Heller?

369
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:32,954
- Where's the money?
- Money?

370
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:34,956
No bullshit.

371
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:38,752
Your husband killed Louis Palo
for the money. Where is it?

372
00:39:38,877 --> 00:39:42,756
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've really knocked me for a loop here.

373
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,842
- Where's Marxie?
- Dead. In the trunk of his car.

374
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,470
Stop this cheap bullshit!

375
00:39:48,595 --> 00:39:50,972
Where's the money that
your husband and Louis Palo...

376
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,767
scammed from the Prizzis in Las Vegas?

377
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,315
Maybe I do know something about it.

378
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,360
He had a bag with him.

379
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,028
I'll show you.

380
00:40:11,451 --> 00:40:15,122
It could be in here.
It's the only place I know it could be.

381
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,640
You're short.

382
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,892
I'm short?

383
00:40:36,226 --> 00:40:39,771
I got $360,000 here. Half.

384
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:41,857
Half?

385
00:40:42,649 --> 00:40:46,695
Don't keep telling me what I just said.
Where's the rest of the money?

386
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,155
You got to believe me.

387
00:40:48,238 --> 00:40:51,950
I didn't even know the money was there.
How could I know it was short?

388
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:54,119
When Marxie came home three nights ago...

389
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:57,998
after being away from me for five years,
he threw that bag in the closet.

390
00:40:58,123 --> 00:40:59,624
That's all I know.

391
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:02,794
Ever ask him why he came back
after five years?

392
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:06,923
Charley, please try and understand.

393
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:10,844
I was glad when Marxie showed up...

394
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,307
'cause it gave me a chance
to ask him for the divorce.

395
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:17,559
You want to know what I remember?

396
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,770
I remember you coming in that door,
and saying, "I'm home, dear."

397
00:41:20,854 --> 00:41:24,024
Is that the way
they ask for a divorce these days?

398
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:29,112
Charley, I could see how sick he was.

399
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:31,740
I didn't need to ask him.

400
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,326
He only had a few weeks left.

401
00:41:37,913 --> 00:41:39,289
Poor Marxie.

402
00:41:43,126 --> 00:41:45,754
In all the years that I knew Marxie Heller...

403
00:41:46,171 --> 00:41:50,675
he never yelled at me, or hit me,
or stole my money.

404
00:41:53,178 --> 00:41:54,804
He was my friend.

405
00:41:56,515 --> 00:42:00,894
If it wasn't for him, I'd probably still be
earning my living on my back...

406
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:04,648
with half of the take
going to your pals in Chicago.

407
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:08,026
It was his idea that I study bookkeeping...

408
00:42:09,444 --> 00:42:11,821
and he got me a job on the main wire, too.

409
00:42:11,905 --> 00:42:14,824
Then he talked them
into making me a courier...

410
00:42:14,908 --> 00:42:19,871
and told me to study the tax laws while
I was flying back and forth to Switzerland.

411
00:42:21,164 --> 00:42:24,918
Marxie was always there for me
like nobody else in my life.

412
00:42:25,627 --> 00:42:29,047
And I loved him.
Not like I love you, but I loved him.

413
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:34,511
Now that's the God's honest truth, Charley...

414
00:42:34,594 --> 00:42:38,473
and if you don't believe me,
why don't you kill me and get it over with?

415
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:47,941
I can't.

416
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,740
I can't change the way I feel about you.

417
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,243
I look at you...

418
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,871
and I see what I want to see.

419
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:06,167
That's what love is.

420
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:09,170
If you were anybody else, I'd blow you away.

421
00:43:11,256 --> 00:43:12,549
But I can't.

422
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:18,972
I have to believe this.

423
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:27,355
How did it go out there?

424
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,399
Half right.

425
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:33,069
I got back $360,000.

426
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,238
How come only half?

427
00:43:36,156 --> 00:43:39,367
I talked to Heller,
he won't say nothing to me.

428
00:43:39,826 --> 00:43:42,621
So I pay him off, ba-bing.

429
00:43:43,288 --> 00:43:45,248
Then the wife comes home.

430
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,168
We talk, no problem.

431
00:43:49,836 --> 00:43:52,172
She brings me the money
which she thinks is there...

432
00:43:52,255 --> 00:43:55,258
because Heller brought a satchel
home with him when he came.

433
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:58,136
I count. It's only half.

434
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,306
You worked her over?

435
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:04,601
She was scared.
She knew I tapped her husband.

436
00:44:04,726 --> 00:44:07,062
I think she's telling the truth.

437
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:10,148
What happened to Louis' split?

438
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:13,151
I don't know, Dominic.

439
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:17,197
Well, somebody's got our $360,000.

440
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:21,326
Find it.

441
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:26,873
Okay.

442
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:39,636
When I close my eyes
and eat your cooking, Charley...

443
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,015
- I think your mama's still with us.
- Thanks, Pop.

444
00:44:49,479 --> 00:44:53,650
You think Dominic believes
that I copped that other $360,000?

445
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,820
What the hell, Charley.
The money had to go somewhere.

446
00:44:56,903 --> 00:44:58,947
Dominic hates your guts, anyway.

447
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:02,534
Yeah, that's getting real bad.
He never lets up.

448
00:45:03,243 --> 00:45:06,037
He don't eat right.
Look, he never eats like this.

449
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:10,250
He's got permanent heartburn from that
place he eats at, Tucci's, I think they call it.

450
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:12,335
They make that Neapolitan garbage.

451
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:13,920
It's not like this.

452
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:18,883
Well, the man can't hate me
because he don't eat right, Pop.

453
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:23,763
Believe me.

454
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:26,474
I know how Dominic's mind works.

455
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,977
His whole life turned out miserable.

456
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:30,437
He has to blame someone.

457
00:45:30,562 --> 00:45:33,314
Every time he sees you,
he's reminded of the shame...

458
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,484
Maerose put on you,
on him, and the whole family.

459
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:39,446
You forgot. Not Dominic.

460
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:44,826
He probably worked it all around,
so the whole mess is all your fault.

461
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,413
If he could have you hit, he'd have you hit.

462
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:51,291
Great dinner, Charley.

463
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,420
What's the occasion?

464
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,965
I wanna show you the woman.

465
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:02,886
The one that I went to California
to see about.

466
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:08,141
Ain't she beautiful?

467
00:46:09,309 --> 00:46:12,812
Well, I like a kind of darker,
more round woman myself.

468
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:16,024
I see you got a picture of me with her.

469
00:46:34,417 --> 00:46:36,961
- Pop, what are you doing?
- Jesus, Charley...

470
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:38,296
she was the outside talent...

471
00:46:38,379 --> 00:46:41,174
we brought the day of the wedding
to make the Netturbino hit.

472
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,301
She was the specialty hitter.

473
00:46:56,189 --> 00:46:58,691
Let me give you a hand with the dishes.

474
00:46:58,775 --> 00:47:00,443
No, that's...

475
00:47:01,528 --> 00:47:03,238
I'll just stack.

476
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,617
The girl'll take care of that
in the morning. Thanks.

477
00:47:08,076 --> 00:47:09,244
All right.

478
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:13,540
Well, then, I'll just head on home.

479
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:16,793
Getting late by my clock.

480
00:47:18,795 --> 00:47:20,755
- Great dinner, Charley.
- Thanks.

481
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:23,091
- Good night, Pop.
- Good night, Son.

482
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,552
Thanks a lot.

483
00:48:10,346 --> 00:48:12,140
Maerose? Charley.

484
00:48:12,682 --> 00:48:15,560
Charley, what is this?
It's 12:45 in the morning.

485
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:19,022
It's the second time you're calling me
in almost four years.

486
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:22,817
Mae, listen.

487
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:28,406
- I <i>broke that</i> vase.
<i>- The vase? What vase?</i>

488
00:48:28,990 --> 00:48:32,785
That special vase that matches
the border on the rug.

489
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,623
The one you knocked yourself out
trying to find.

490
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,876
Charley, what are you, out of your mind?

491
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,630
<i>- Are you alone?
- Of course I'm alone, Mumpola.</i>

492
00:48:46,049 --> 00:48:47,634
I gotta see you.

493
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:02,106
What's with you?

494
00:49:03,775 --> 00:49:05,068
I gotta talk.

495
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:09,322
You wanna talk out here,
or you wanna come in and sit down?

496
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:12,533
Sure.

497
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:22,168
This is a beautiful setup you got here, Mae.

498
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,297
The colors are right. That's what counts.

499
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:30,009
Everybody sees shapes differently,
but colors are forever.

500
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:31,719
Yeah.

501
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,182
Why did you call, Charley?

502
00:49:39,352 --> 00:49:43,523
- We wasted a lot of time, Mae.
- Four years. You call that a lot of time?

503
00:49:43,815 --> 00:49:46,192
How come you didn't wait till I was 50?

504
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:51,030
You could have been a fat wop broad
by the time you were 50.

505
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,042
You want to do it, Charley?

506
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,503
Is that what you want?

507
00:50:07,213 --> 00:50:09,382
Take it easy. What the hell, Mae?

508
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:14,095
Nobody took it slower than me, Charley.

509
00:50:15,138 --> 00:50:16,389
Four years.

510
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:19,517
Answer the question. You want to do it?

511
00:50:21,602 --> 00:50:22,562
Yeah.

512
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,733
Let's do it.

513
00:50:31,612 --> 00:50:33,823
- With all the lights on?
- Yeah.

514
00:50:34,699 --> 00:50:37,076
Right here on the Oriental...

515
00:50:38,202 --> 00:50:39,746
with all the lights on.

516
00:50:43,416 --> 00:50:45,168
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

517
00:50:52,842 --> 00:50:53,801
Thanks.

518
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,520
What's your problem, Charley?

519
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,982
It certainly isn't the goddamn vase.

520
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,945
How can I tell you, of all people?

521
00:51:14,489 --> 00:51:16,824
But I got nobody else I can talk to.

522
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:21,871
It's about a woman.

523
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:28,252
Go ahead, tell me anyway.

524
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:33,674
How can I feel worse than I used to feel
before last night?

525
00:51:35,885 --> 00:51:38,930
We grew up together.
We're the same people.

526
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:45,269
What the hell, Charley?
The calendar takes care of everything.

527
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,568
Met her in a church.

528
00:51:53,569 --> 00:51:54,904
It just happened.

529
00:51:55,571 --> 00:51:57,657
I knew she was the woman for me.

530
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:04,122
She organized a scam in Vegas.

531
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,835
I go looking for the bad guy,
and it turns out to be my woman.

532
00:52:08,918 --> 00:52:10,419
Can you imagine this?

533
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:12,505
Not only that...

534
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:17,927
Pop tells me she's the piece man
for the Netturbino contract.

535
00:52:20,179 --> 00:52:22,598
Just the same, I love her, Mae.

536
00:52:23,683 --> 00:52:24,684
I love her.

537
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:27,061
Well.

538
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:32,024
How can I live with this?
I've got to do something about it.

539
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:34,026
I've got to straighten it out.

540
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:35,611
Then do.

541
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:41,284
Do what? Do I ice her? Do I marry her?
Which one of these?

542
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:44,203
Marry her, Charley.

543
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:47,248
Just because she's a thief and a hitter...

544
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:50,877
doesn't mean she's not a good woman
in all the other departments.

545
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:55,006
If she were some kind of fashion model,
it wouldn't last more than 30 days.

546
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:58,551
But you and she
are in the same line of business.

547
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:03,222
You are lucky you found each other,
you know that, Charley?

548
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:06,350
- Yeah, I guess.
- She's an American.

549
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:10,271
She had a chance to make a buck,
so she grabbed it.

550
00:53:11,314 --> 00:53:12,899
Marry her, Charley.

551
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,153
Then at least I'll be able to
get something out of it.

552
00:53:17,778 --> 00:53:20,281
I'll be able to go back in the family.

553
00:53:23,618 --> 00:53:24,577
Yeah.

554
00:53:33,336 --> 00:53:36,172
- Thanks.
- Shall we have them play Noche de Ronda?

555
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,425
- Yeah.
- Would you ask them?

556
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:49,560
- I've been all shook up.
- Why?

557
00:53:51,646 --> 00:53:53,022
I know everything.

558
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:58,611
I know you made the hit on Netturbino,
after the wedding reception, when we met.

559
00:53:59,195 --> 00:54:02,657
I know you've been scamming us
with Louis and your husband.

560
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:10,790
I did the work on Netturbino.

561
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:14,877
I had nothing to do
with what Marxie and his partner did.

562
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,840
Louis Palo was so suspicious
that he checked the car for bombs...

563
00:54:19,924 --> 00:54:21,884
every time he started it.

564
00:54:22,051 --> 00:54:26,681
But he would have let some beautiful broad
walk over, get in, and sit on his face.

565
00:54:29,517 --> 00:54:32,603
No matter how you got it in your head,
Charley, you're wrong.

566
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:34,855
I had nothing to do with it.

567
00:54:41,404 --> 00:54:45,408
Did you mean it that first night,
when you asked if I'd marry you?

568
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:54,667
All right.

569
00:54:56,669 --> 00:55:00,339
The Prizzis are gonna have to believe me,
because I believe you.

570
00:55:04,635 --> 00:55:06,512
When can we get married?

571
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:09,432
Let's have another one of those
pineapple drinks.

572
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:12,643
- The honeymoon has already started.
- Kiss me, Charley.

573
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:15,438
In public?

574
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:21,944
<i>Pop? Charley.</i>

575
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,197
<i>I'm in L.A., and that ain't all.</i>

576
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:27,700
<i>I'm gonna get married.</i>

577
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:31,495
- The same woman, the contractor?
- Yeah.

578
00:55:32,371 --> 00:55:35,833
<i>She's Polish, but the family
will get used to that gradually.</i>

579
00:55:36,042 --> 00:55:40,546
Every time she walks in a room, the other
women in the family will have to shut up.

580
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:44,800
But I know how you feel about it.
I won't try to stop nature. Good luck, Son.

581
00:55:45,343 --> 00:55:46,719
<i>Thanks, Pop.</i>

582
00:55:47,011 --> 00:55:51,098
Say listen, the Don wants you here
for a big meeting tomorrow night.

583
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:55,311
<i>Jesus, Pop, what about my honeymoon?</i>

584
00:55:56,812 --> 00:55:58,731
You'll have it in Brooklyn.

585
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,484
<i>Shit.</i>

586
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:51,784
What do you say we go for some confetti...

587
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:54,870
and maybe a couple of pictures?

588
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:56,831
Whatever you say, honey.

589
00:56:57,456 --> 00:57:01,585
God, Charley.
If Marxie could only see me now.

590
00:57:03,504 --> 00:57:07,341
- What's so funny?
- Me marrying a Sicilian.

591
00:57:08,384 --> 00:57:10,261
You know, I can just hear him.

592
00:57:10,344 --> 00:57:14,056
He always use to say, "The Jews
in this business are bad enough, darling...

593
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,976
"but the Sicilians,
they'd rather eat their children...

594
00:57:17,059 --> 00:57:20,646
"than part with money,
and they are very fond of their children."

595
00:57:24,150 --> 00:57:28,279
If Marxie Heller is so fucking smart,
how come he's so fucking dead?

596
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:29,864
Next.

597
00:58:14,992 --> 00:58:19,622
The gentleman at the end of the table
is Mr. Alvin Gomsky.

598
00:58:20,164 --> 00:58:24,627
He's treasurer of the 18th largest bank
in the United States...

599
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:28,005
of which we own 25 percent.

600
00:58:29,673 --> 00:58:32,426
Now, I asked Mr. Gomsky
to come here today...

601
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,555
so you can hear from his own mouth
what has been happening.

602
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:41,560
The bank president, Mr. Robert Finlay,
is stealing from the bank...

603
00:58:41,685 --> 00:58:45,231
principally through
crooked foreign exchange deals.

604
00:58:45,648 --> 00:58:49,485
If he's allowed to continue,
the bank will go under in less than a year.

605
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,904
Thank you, Mr. Gomsky.

606
00:58:54,657 --> 00:58:57,409
See Mr. Gomsky to his car.

607
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,292
Robert Finlay's real name...

608
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:09,046
is Rosario Filargi.

609
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:14,510
Now, anybody who'd change his name
from Filargi to Finlay...

610
00:59:14,802 --> 00:59:16,512
is also stupid enough...

611
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:20,516
to think that we wouldn't protect
our 25 percent.

612
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:23,644
Tell them our plan, Eduardo.

613
00:59:27,606 --> 00:59:29,900
We are gonna kidnap Filargi.

614
00:59:31,652 --> 00:59:34,363
He's covered with $2.5 million
in kidnap insurance...

615
00:59:34,446 --> 00:59:37,074
so that's the tag on him
when we make the snatch.

616
00:59:38,158 --> 00:59:41,328
We know the insurance company will pay,
because as Charley stated...

617
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,622
that ransom money is tax-deductible.

618
00:59:45,207 --> 00:59:47,459
We are also going to leave a trail...

619
00:59:48,002 --> 00:59:51,422
so the Feds will think
Filargi organized the whole thing...

620
00:59:51,589 --> 00:59:54,466
cheating the bank,
milking the insurance company.

621
00:59:57,261 --> 00:59:59,138
When the merda hits the fan...

622
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,643
we can buy another good-size chunk
of the bank for about 10 cents on the dollar.

623
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:06,854
We get controlling interest.

624
01:00:07,271 --> 01:00:08,480
Eventually...

625
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:13,819
we stand to make $60-70 million.

626
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:16,989
Thank you, Eduardo, my son.

627
01:00:19,116 --> 01:00:23,203
Some men suffer most
when you take their lives.

628
01:00:23,621 --> 01:00:25,914
Life is what is sweetest to them.

629
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:30,169
To Filargi, money is sweetest.

630
01:00:31,629 --> 01:00:36,008
We'll leave him with his life
and without money or any way to get it.

631
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:40,512
Marron, Don Corrado, that's beautiful.

632
01:00:41,597 --> 01:00:43,599
I almost feel sorry for the guy.

633
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:48,687
- Beautiful is right.
- I like most beautiful things, Charley.

634
01:00:48,771 --> 01:00:51,774
This one is very simple.

635
01:00:52,191 --> 01:00:53,442
We rely on you.

636
01:00:57,863 --> 01:00:59,615
How do you want me to handle it?

637
01:00:59,698 --> 01:01:02,701
Pick your own people.
We don't want to know.

638
01:01:11,627 --> 01:01:15,214
Dominic, my son, stay with me a moment.

639
01:01:21,804 --> 01:01:24,848
Maerose has written to me, Dominic.

640
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,853
The man she wronged
has married another woman.

641
01:01:31,021 --> 01:01:35,526
Now, Maerose has suffered, Dominic,
as you have suffered...

642
01:01:35,651 --> 01:01:38,028
during the years of her disgrace.

643
01:01:39,780 --> 01:01:42,616
Now honor is protected.

644
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:46,203
I beg you, on my knees...

645
01:01:46,912 --> 01:01:48,539
show compassion.

646
01:01:49,998 --> 01:01:52,000
Here, read her letter.

647
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:59,091
Look how the child loves you.

648
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,761
She wants to take care of you.

649
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,268
Send her to me, Papa.

650
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:13,313
She's my daughter again.

651
01:02:14,565 --> 01:02:17,985
What we've got to do
is take care of the bodyguard...

652
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:21,530
and get Filargi down to our van
in the basement, right?

653
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:24,783
There's only three apartments on the floor.

654
01:02:24,908 --> 01:02:28,912
- This one is Filargi's, we get the other two.
- How you gonna do that?

655
01:02:30,289 --> 01:02:32,875
One of them is empty. This one, we rent it.

656
01:02:33,208 --> 01:02:35,627
The other one,
we send matinee theater tickets...

657
01:02:35,711 --> 01:02:39,131
and a heavy-duty lunch invitation
to the dame that lives there.

658
01:02:39,298 --> 01:02:41,967
A limo picks her up and brings her back.

659
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:45,554
She thinks it's a prize that
she's getting for helping to plant tulips...

660
01:02:45,637 --> 01:02:47,890
at the public library last year.

661
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,184
She'll go, all right? Now...

662
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:54,188
every day, Filargi's bodyguard
comes out first...

663
01:02:54,271 --> 01:02:58,484
he goes to the elevator, pushes the button,
when it gets there, he puts it on hold.

664
01:02:58,567 --> 01:03:01,820
Then he goes back to the apartment
and knocks on the door.

665
01:03:02,237 --> 01:03:04,656
That's when Filargi comes out.

666
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:08,327
Now, you know, you guys,
you need a woman on this stand.

667
01:03:09,369 --> 01:03:10,913
- A woman?
- Yeah.

668
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:15,167
Look, Charley, a woman comes out
of the south apartment, holding a baby...

669
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:18,545
after Filargi's bodyguard
gets him out of his apartment.

670
01:03:18,629 --> 01:03:19,838
She smiles at them.

671
01:03:19,963 --> 01:03:22,758
She goes "goo-goo ga-ga" to the baby,
then she tosses it...

672
01:03:22,841 --> 01:03:25,177
at the bodyguard,
who naturally tries to catch it.

673
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:28,055
While he's doing that,
she gets her piece out and covers him.

674
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:31,725
Then you come out of the other apartment.
You take Filargi to the garage.

675
01:03:31,809 --> 01:03:36,063
Then she takes the bodyguard to Filargi's
apartment, does the job on him there.

676
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:37,523
That's good.

677
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:39,858
For Christ's sake!

678
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,319
Where we gonna get a baby?

679
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:45,405
Where we gonna find a broad
would do something like this?

680
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,574
Where? Here. Me.

681
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:51,203
- We'll get a fake baby.
- Good thinking, Irene.

682
01:03:52,162 --> 01:03:55,290
You guys work it out.
I got a terrific dinner almost ready.

683
01:03:55,374 --> 01:03:57,251
Just be a couple of minutes.

684
01:03:59,545 --> 01:04:01,296
What's the matter with you?

685
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,675
I didn't get married
so my wife could go on working.

686
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,010
Charley, she's right, and you know it.

687
01:04:07,094 --> 01:04:10,347
Throwing a baby,
why, that's strictly a masterpiece.

688
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:14,726
If the Prizzis ever found out
I used my own wife on this job...

689
01:04:14,810 --> 01:04:16,728
I couldn't hold my head up.

690
01:04:16,812 --> 01:04:21,275
I'd be the laughing stock
of every family in Brooklyn and New York.

691
01:04:21,942 --> 01:04:23,735
Who's gonna know, Charley?

692
01:04:23,819 --> 01:04:27,614
And anyway, what's a little honor
compared to $60-70 million?

693
01:04:33,287 --> 01:04:35,080
Gentlemen, dinner is served.

694
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,729
Coming, Papa.

695
01:05:46,777 --> 01:05:47,986
Jesus, Mae...

696
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:50,405
you look awful.

697
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:55,118
My beautiful daughter
has turned into an old woman.

698
01:05:57,162 --> 01:05:59,289
Charley Partanna did this to you.

699
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:03,627
He had a chance to become
part of the Prizzi family.

700
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,004
He had no use for you.

701
01:06:08,423 --> 01:06:10,550
He had a use for me, Papa.

702
01:06:12,302 --> 01:06:14,096
He came to my place in New York...

703
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:17,474
the night before he left to marry
the woman in California.

704
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:21,103
And he forced himself on me...

705
01:06:22,688 --> 01:06:24,356
and he did it to me.

706
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:28,944
- He did it to you?
- Yeah, Papa.

707
01:06:29,361 --> 01:06:32,864
He screwed me three times, maybe four.
I can't remember.

708
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:35,867
You wash out your filthy mouth, you hear?

709
01:06:36,326 --> 01:06:39,329
How can you say such things
to your own father?

710
01:06:40,831 --> 01:06:44,543
He done that to you? Are you sure?

711
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:46,294
Am I sure?

712
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,548
Papa, you should see
the size of him, you should.

713
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,926
Shut up! How can you say
such things to your father?

714
01:06:53,385 --> 01:06:56,221
- Where's your honor?
- Are you kidding, Papa?

715
01:06:56,847 --> 01:06:58,974
I have no honor anymore.

716
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:36,386
Here, Papa.

717
01:08:06,917 --> 01:08:07,876
Come on.

718
01:08:13,924 --> 01:08:15,926
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

719
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:20,055
Do you mind?

720
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:32,567
Catch.

721
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:43,411
I must have the wrong floor.

722
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,497
Oh, my God.

723
01:08:57,509 --> 01:08:58,885
No blood stains.

724
01:08:59,094 --> 01:09:01,096
Okay, come on, let's move them.

725
01:09:11,022 --> 01:09:13,692
I had to hit her.
She was looking straight at me.

726
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:16,236
You done right. Really.

727
01:09:32,085 --> 01:09:33,670
I can't get over it.

728
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:38,800
I mean, what kind of creep
wouldn't catch a baby?

729
01:09:38,884 --> 01:09:42,012
If it was real,
it would have been crippled for life.

730
01:09:43,138 --> 01:09:45,682
He wasn't paid to bodyguard no baby.

731
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:52,564
When the Don gets what he wants,
I'll ask him for some time...

732
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,775
we go to the old country,
have a real honeymoon...

733
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:57,736
maybe even a real baby.

734
01:09:58,153 --> 01:10:00,530
God, Charley, I love you.

735
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,803
What's going on? What are you doing?

736
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:38,401
- See you at dinner.
- Okay, dear.

737
01:11:12,978 --> 01:11:16,690
<i>Recapping our top stories at this hour,
there are new developments in that...</i>

738
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:19,359
- Phone, Charley.
- Shut up. I want to hear this.

739
01:11:19,442 --> 01:11:21,820
<i>Police have now identified both victims.</i>

740
01:11:21,945 --> 01:11:25,365
<i>- One of them was a police captain's wife.
- Shit.</i>

741
01:11:25,907 --> 01:11:27,826
<i>The man found with her
was the bodyguard...</i>

742
01:11:27,909 --> 01:11:29,828
<i>of bank president, Robert Finlay.</i>

743
01:11:29,911 --> 01:11:32,372
<i>Finlay's apartment
is right next door to the one...</i>

744
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:35,834
<i>where the two bodies were found.
Bank officers reported him missing...</i>

745
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:38,420
<i>when he didn't show up at a meeting
Monday morning.</i>

746
01:11:38,503 --> 01:11:41,214
<i>Police now speculate
he has been kidnapped.</i>

747
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:45,051
<i>They also believe that Victoria Caihane,
who'd gone to visit in the building...</i>

748
01:11:45,135 --> 01:11:48,096
<i>stumbled accidentally
into the scene of the crime.</i>

749
01:11:48,847 --> 01:11:52,434
How about this?
First, she's got to push the wrong button.

750
01:11:52,517 --> 01:11:56,187
And then, the broad
turns out to be a cop's wife.

751
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,524
The phone's still waiting.

752
01:11:59,941 --> 01:12:02,444
<i>...matinee theater tickets
for a Broadway show.</i>

753
01:12:02,527 --> 01:12:06,281
<i>A limousine picked them up,
and returned them after the show.</i>

754
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:10,160
<i>We will have more late-breaking news
after this pause.</i>

755
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,580
<i>- Yeah?
- Hi, honey.</i>

756
01:12:15,332 --> 01:12:18,043
- Were you watching the TV just now?
- Yeah.

757
01:12:18,335 --> 01:12:21,379
<i>A police captain's wife. Just my luck.</i>

758
01:12:21,504 --> 01:12:24,674
Yeah, all hell's gonna break out
over this, Irene.

759
01:12:24,841 --> 01:12:28,094
The cops don't like it much
when you hit one of their wives.

760
01:12:28,178 --> 01:12:29,804
<i>But it was an accident.</i>

761
01:12:53,453 --> 01:12:54,913
Mr. Ciglione?

762
01:13:12,931 --> 01:13:16,601
Miss Prizzi, would you like
to come to my office, please?

763
01:13:16,684 --> 01:13:19,604
Miss Prizzi, would you care to have a drink?

764
01:13:19,979 --> 01:13:22,273
I'll have a Babycham.

765
01:13:22,607 --> 01:13:23,608
Babycham?

766
01:13:23,691 --> 01:13:26,152
You heard what the lady said, a Babycham.

767
01:13:28,655 --> 01:13:31,991
Please, sit down, Miss Prizzi.
I think I got something for you.

768
01:13:39,499 --> 01:13:41,042
Sit down over there.

769
01:13:51,386 --> 01:13:54,055
Is that the broad? Tell the lady.

770
01:13:55,265 --> 01:13:58,560
I was using this camper
as a trick room in the parking lot.

771
01:13:59,352 --> 01:14:03,189
As I lifted up my head from the job,
I seen this woman in hot pants...

772
01:14:03,273 --> 01:14:07,277
run into the lights of the car
where Louis Palo caught it in the head.

773
01:14:07,402 --> 01:14:11,156
She was in the car a couple of minutes,
then she gets out...

774
01:14:11,281 --> 01:14:14,367
and she goes to the trunk
and she takes out a satchel.

775
01:14:14,742 --> 01:14:17,162
- Then she fades.
- Same woman?

776
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:21,124
Yeah, it's the same one.

777
01:14:39,642 --> 01:14:42,353
Why don't you go
on one of those cruises, honey?

778
01:14:51,279 --> 01:14:55,533
<i>You've reached the answering machine
of 555-4375.</i>

779
01:14:55,909 --> 01:14:59,954
No one can take your call right <i>now.</i>
Please leave a message after the beep.

780
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:04,000
Meet me on the Promenade, Brooklyn.

781
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:07,462
7:00 p.m. tomorrow. Full price.

782
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:11,966
I'll be at the south end, on a bench,
reading Popular Mechanics.

783
01:15:57,387 --> 01:15:58,846
You the contractor?

784
01:16:02,934 --> 01:16:03,935
How much?

785
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:08,231
It depends. Some hits are tricky.

786
01:16:08,773 --> 01:16:12,402
- Who is it?
- A Brooklyn fellow, Charley Partanna.

787
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:35,008
Amalia told me that you want to thank me
for bringing you home?

788
01:16:36,551 --> 01:16:37,635
Who else?

789
01:16:38,219 --> 01:16:40,471
You are blood of my blood.

790
01:16:41,931 --> 01:16:44,559
You're flesh of my flesh. Yeah.

791
01:16:44,892 --> 01:16:46,936
And as long as I'm able...

792
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:50,565
I'm gonna think about your well-being.

793
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,775
- Thank you, Grandfather.
- Yeah.

794
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:55,570
You have drawn me back from purgatory.

795
01:16:58,406 --> 01:17:01,075
I wish you had been a son.

796
01:17:01,784 --> 01:17:03,828
You are a true Prizzi.

797
01:17:04,621 --> 01:17:06,623
You like to have a cookie?

798
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:13,880
It is I who must offer you a gift, Grandfather.

799
01:17:14,589 --> 01:17:18,885
- A gesture of my gratitude.
- I have always enjoyed gifts.

800
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:33,483
Who is this handsome lady?

801
01:17:35,193 --> 01:17:37,862
That is Charley Partanna's wife.

802
01:17:48,915 --> 01:17:52,377
Grandfather, my gift to you
is not only the pictures...

803
01:17:53,127 --> 01:17:55,046
but also what they mean.

804
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:59,175
Louis Palo was killed
in a parking lot in Las Vegas.

805
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:01,928
- I know.
- I took these pictures there.

806
01:18:04,055 --> 01:18:08,226
There was a woman who'd been turning
tricks in a camper in the parking lot.

807
01:18:09,352 --> 01:18:12,855
She told me she saw this woman
get into a car with Palo.

808
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,901
After a minute, she got out,
went to the trunk.

809
01:18:17,652 --> 01:18:19,362
She took out a satchel.

810
01:18:21,406 --> 01:18:25,159
- This woman?
- Yes, Grandfather.

811
01:18:28,079 --> 01:18:29,497
She killed Palo...

812
01:18:30,248 --> 01:18:33,876
and she stole $720,000 from us.

813
01:18:34,877 --> 01:18:37,088
She gave back half to save herself.

814
01:18:40,425 --> 01:18:42,552
What do you want me to do?

815
01:18:44,595 --> 01:18:46,097
She dishonored us.

816
01:18:46,597 --> 01:18:48,266
You are like me.

817
01:18:48,891 --> 01:18:50,601
We forgive nothing.

818
01:18:56,482 --> 01:19:00,570
Now what would that do
to Charley Partanna?

819
01:19:01,612 --> 01:19:04,073
She must pay, like anybody else.

820
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:08,494
To do what you ask,
that would cause Charley...

821
01:19:09,495 --> 01:19:10,830
great pain.

822
01:19:11,789 --> 01:19:14,625
What is that
compared to the honor of the Prizzis?

823
01:19:15,084 --> 01:19:18,296
Charley is like my son.

824
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,426
I pledged to be his second father
on the day that he was born.

825
01:19:25,052 --> 01:19:26,929
- Grandfather!
- Shut up!

826
01:19:29,474 --> 01:19:31,350
Have another cookie, my dear.

827
01:19:42,069 --> 01:19:45,990
What we're here for is to tell you what
we're telling all the families in this town.

828
01:19:46,115 --> 01:19:50,119
All contracts are off until we get
whoever killed Captain Calhane's wife.

829
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:55,124
- How do you mean, Davey?
- He means nothing is happening.

830
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:58,002
We're coming down hard on you.

831
01:19:58,169 --> 01:20:00,755
A police captain's wife has been murdered.

832
01:20:01,756 --> 01:20:04,675
You got narcotics, right?
Plus loan sharking.

833
01:20:05,218 --> 01:20:08,471
Plus horse books,
football, basketball, boxing...

834
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:12,725
as well as what you take out of
restaurants and the trucking business.

835
01:20:12,809 --> 01:20:17,605
There's a couple of million in television sets
that fall off trucks every week, right?

836
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:21,108
We're gonna put them all
out of business, as of now.

837
01:20:22,777 --> 01:20:26,572
It'll cost us hundreds of thousands,
but that's the way it's gonna be.

838
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:30,993
Davey, I've been doing business
with the Police Commissioner's squad...

839
01:20:31,077 --> 01:20:32,662
for 40 years now.

840
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:36,874
We always went under one rule:
you take our money, you leave us alone.

841
01:20:38,501 --> 01:20:42,213
The more pressure you put on us,
the more money you'll cost yourselves.

842
01:20:43,422 --> 01:20:47,885
There ain't a cop that's had to get along
on straight police pay for a long time.

843
01:20:48,594 --> 01:20:49,554
Yeah.

844
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:54,684
Look, Angelo, our people don't like this
any better than you do...

845
01:20:55,101 --> 01:20:57,144
but this one's a point of honor with us.

846
01:20:57,228 --> 01:20:59,230
You understand that, Angelo?

847
01:21:25,464 --> 01:21:27,508
You're a fine looking woman.

848
01:21:29,051 --> 01:21:31,721
Charley Partanna is a lucky man.

849
01:21:33,431 --> 01:21:34,932
Thank you for coming.

850
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:39,937
What a surprise you gave us
with this sudden wedding.

851
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,941
We just sort of swept each other away.

852
01:21:44,400 --> 01:21:47,695
I understand. I was young once.

853
01:21:48,863 --> 01:21:52,033
But this marriage of yours...

854
01:21:52,825 --> 01:21:54,702
has troubled me.

855
01:21:56,871 --> 01:21:58,331
Why, Don Corrado?

856
01:21:59,165 --> 01:22:03,878
The people at Presto Ciglione's place
in Vegas have looked at pictures of you...

857
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:07,256
and they told us that you killed Louis Palo.

858
01:22:12,637 --> 01:22:15,306
Under ordinary circumstances...

859
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:18,017
you would have to be punished...

860
01:22:18,684 --> 01:22:21,562
because those who steal must pay.

861
01:22:23,898 --> 01:22:26,150
But you're the wife of my godson...

862
01:22:27,193 --> 01:22:31,906
and I've searched to find some way
to show you clemency.

863
01:22:33,908 --> 01:22:35,159
What can I do?

864
01:22:35,701 --> 01:22:39,455
You got the other half of the $720,000?

865
01:22:40,122 --> 01:22:41,165
Yes.

866
01:22:41,958 --> 01:22:44,293
- Was Charley in this with you?
- No.

867
01:22:45,461 --> 01:22:48,381
He believed me when I told him
the half was Marxie's split.

868
01:22:48,464 --> 01:22:52,259
He didn't know I had anything to do with it,
or that I did the number on Louis.

869
01:22:52,343 --> 01:22:53,427
Good.

870
01:22:55,137 --> 01:22:57,098
You can have five days...

871
01:22:58,808 --> 01:23:01,519
to get the $360,000 together.

872
01:23:02,103 --> 01:23:04,480
Then you will give it back...

873
01:23:05,064 --> 01:23:09,735
together with a 50-percent penalty
for what you have done to us.

874
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:13,406
Will five days be enough time for you?

875
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:18,619
Five days?
Yeah, I can get it together in five days.

876
01:23:28,629 --> 01:23:30,589
Irene? Charley.

877
01:23:33,676 --> 01:23:35,219
How come you're in L.A.?

878
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:38,222
<i>I had business to attend to.
Didn't you see my note?</i>

879
01:23:38,973 --> 01:23:41,100
Can you get out here this weekend?

880
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,519
I don't think so.

881
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:48,691
Tell me.

882
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:50,735
Tell you what?

883
01:23:51,652 --> 01:23:53,320
<i>Tell me, "I love you."</i>

884
01:23:55,489 --> 01:23:58,075
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

885
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:00,369
And it's real.

886
01:24:00,536 --> 01:24:03,414
It may not be scientific, but it's real.

887
01:24:04,123 --> 01:24:05,416
Scientific?

888
01:24:06,542 --> 01:24:08,419
I read it in a magazine.

889
01:24:08,544 --> 01:24:12,590
According to a doctor,
everyone's always trying to get...

890
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,761
what they thought they needed
from their mothers, but they didn't get it.

891
01:24:18,763 --> 01:24:21,265
Charley, I don't even remember my mother.

892
01:24:21,682 --> 01:24:23,517
That's the amazing part.

893
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:26,979
There's something in you
that knows anyways.

894
01:24:27,063 --> 01:24:28,564
The magazine said so.

895
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:31,442
That's what love is.

896
01:24:32,026 --> 01:24:35,321
When you find someone who will give you...

897
01:24:35,696 --> 01:24:38,824
what you think you wanted
when you were a baby.

898
01:24:39,617 --> 01:24:42,495
<i>But you didn't get it. A doctor wrote this.</i>

899
01:24:43,537 --> 01:24:45,164
Charley, forget doctors.

900
01:24:46,999 --> 01:24:49,543
Better yet, let's play doctor.

901
01:24:52,046 --> 01:24:53,297
On the phone?

902
01:24:57,510 --> 01:25:01,222
Doctor Partanna, I have this itch.

903
01:25:56,402 --> 01:25:58,988
They're not kidding around this time.

904
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:01,574
It's gonna get worse.

905
01:26:02,575 --> 01:26:05,077
They're gonna keep leaning on us...

906
01:26:05,786 --> 01:26:09,373
until we give them whoever it was
that hit that cop's wife.

907
01:26:10,833 --> 01:26:13,043
All I know is one thing here.

908
01:26:13,878 --> 01:26:17,047
The cops tell us
that the guy who got snatched...

909
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:20,301
the day they did the number
on the cop's wife...

910
01:26:21,552 --> 01:26:23,470
also did big business...

911
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,307
with the Prizzi family.

912
01:26:30,102 --> 01:26:32,396
I want to make this a short meet.

913
01:26:32,771 --> 01:26:35,274
I want to put it to a vote right now...

914
01:26:36,442 --> 01:26:38,319
that Dominic Prizzi...

915
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,740
tells us what the hell he's gonna do about it.

916
01:26:43,365 --> 01:26:44,742
Am I right?

917
01:26:45,409 --> 01:26:47,036
Raise your hands.

918
01:26:49,205 --> 01:26:50,748
Hold the hands.

919
01:26:53,584 --> 01:26:56,086
Who do you think you're talking to?

920
01:26:57,254 --> 01:26:59,006
I am Dominic Prizzi.

921
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:05,262
While most of you was walking around
with holes in the ass of your pants...

922
01:27:05,429 --> 01:27:07,932
we were sticking up gas stations.

923
01:27:08,557 --> 01:27:11,352
We was the biggest family in the country.

924
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:16,273
And now, most of you have figured out
how to push broads.

925
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:18,943
We're still the biggest.

926
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:24,281
We lose more, when the cops
get in an uproar, than any of you.

927
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:27,201
Now, we don't like it...

928
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:31,622
but you ain't gonna tell us
how to run our business.

929
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:37,461
We ain't taking any shit
from any outsiders...

930
01:27:38,337 --> 01:27:40,381
about the family business.

931
01:27:41,548 --> 01:27:43,509
And I mean, especially...

932
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:47,179
a scummy little pimp, like you...

933
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:49,223
Signor Bocca.

934
01:28:11,453 --> 01:28:12,538
Thank you.

935
01:28:19,003 --> 01:28:22,673
Padrino, I never saw anything like this here.

936
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:27,344
The broad pushes the wrong button
in the elevator.

937
01:28:27,803 --> 01:28:30,514
The door opens just in the minute...

938
01:28:30,597 --> 01:28:32,975
when the second man drops the bodyguard.

939
01:28:33,058 --> 01:28:37,187
The woman is standing there.
She makes all three of us.

940
01:28:38,397 --> 01:28:39,857
She had to go.

941
01:28:40,107 --> 01:28:43,944
I am sure you didn't act without thinking.

942
01:28:45,404 --> 01:28:48,449
That's why I called you here today.

943
01:28:48,782 --> 01:28:50,367
You're a thinker.

944
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:57,041
Dominic is a sick man...

945
01:28:59,168 --> 01:29:02,004
and the return of his daughter
brought him no ease.

946
01:29:02,171 --> 01:29:03,881
He's got ulcers coming on.

947
01:29:03,964 --> 01:29:06,300
I'm gonna move Dominic out to Vegas...

948
01:29:06,425 --> 01:29:09,178
and make you boss.

949
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:21,440
I'm speechless, Padrino.

950
01:29:29,156 --> 01:29:31,909
This is an honor...

951
01:29:34,953 --> 01:29:36,538
beyond my dreams.

952
01:29:39,583 --> 01:29:42,169
What could I do to show my gratitude?

953
01:29:42,378 --> 01:29:45,255
For the time being, this must be our secret.

954
01:29:45,547 --> 01:29:48,008
You must not even tell your father.

955
01:29:53,222 --> 01:29:55,349
I don't understand, Padrino.

956
01:29:56,183 --> 01:30:00,229
We will announce everything
once the Filargi thing is settled.

957
01:30:01,146 --> 01:30:04,024
Then Dominic will move out...

958
01:30:04,108 --> 01:30:06,777
and you will move in.

959
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,803
God, I missed you.

960
01:30:34,555 --> 01:30:35,889
So I gather.

961
01:30:38,308 --> 01:30:40,185
What's been happening?

962
01:30:43,188 --> 01:30:44,398
Plenty.

963
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,776
I just had a meeting with the Don.

964
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,238
Private audience.

965
01:30:55,325 --> 01:30:57,327
He wants me to take over.

966
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:01,957
He says Dominic's sick.
They're gonna send him to Vegas.

967
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:05,502
- I'm to be the boss.
- Charley, that's fantastic.

968
01:31:05,961 --> 01:31:07,421
I don't know.

969
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:09,882
It smells fishy to me.

970
01:31:12,593 --> 01:31:13,927
Number one:

971
01:31:15,596 --> 01:31:19,975
It should've been Dominic who told me,
instead of the Don.

972
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:23,520
Maybe the Don
hasn't broken the news to Dominic yet.

973
01:31:24,646 --> 01:31:28,442
Whether he has or whether he hasn't,
he would've told Pop.

974
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:34,531
He don't decide what Mass to go to
unless he talks to Pop.

975
01:31:35,449 --> 01:31:40,204
A big deal like this,
they go over every angle 15 times.

976
01:31:40,454 --> 01:31:43,707
- And he didn't?
- No, worse than that.

977
01:31:44,833 --> 01:31:48,212
The Don says for me not to tell Pop.

978
01:31:49,755 --> 01:31:52,549
- Want to know what I think, Irene?
- What?

979
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:59,473
I think they're setting me up.

980
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:10,442
I think you're right, Charley.
I think they're after our scalps.

981
01:32:10,943 --> 01:32:12,694
How do you know that?

982
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:16,240
I got a couple of things to tell you.

983
01:32:17,449 --> 01:32:19,910
I went out to L.A. on orders from the Don.

984
01:32:19,993 --> 01:32:22,287
He told me, return the money
I took from Louis...

985
01:32:22,371 --> 01:32:24,373
plus 50-percent interest.

986
01:32:24,540 --> 01:32:26,959
So you did zotz Louis Palo.

987
01:32:27,042 --> 01:32:29,920
You swore to me that you didn't.
You lied to me!

988
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:34,049
I lied to you because you wanted me to.
I only told you what you wanted to be true.

989
01:32:34,132 --> 01:32:38,512
And I told the Don it was all my doing,
but Jesus, Charley, I'm so sorry.

990
01:32:42,891 --> 01:32:45,686
What's the other thing you've got to tell me?

991
01:32:46,061 --> 01:32:48,564
Dominic's put out a contract on you.

992
01:32:50,524 --> 01:32:54,528
- What are you, fucking nuts?
- Charley, I'm the contractor.

993
01:32:57,281 --> 01:33:00,242
Dominic hires my own wife to clip me?

994
01:33:00,909 --> 01:33:04,913
Charley, he didn't know I was your wife.
He just wanted the best.

995
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:08,667
Charley, honey...

996
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:11,420
let's go to Hong Kong tonight.

997
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:16,216
- What are you talking about?
- I mean, let's beat it while we still can.

998
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:19,886
- Beat it?
- Yes, scram, split. Let's make a run for it.

999
01:33:20,053 --> 01:33:24,516
I know this guy in Hong Kong can give us
new prints, even new faces, in a few days.

1000
01:33:24,558 --> 01:33:27,477
We can get out of this crazy world.
We can start fresh.

1001
01:33:27,561 --> 01:33:29,855
We can be together all the time.

1002
01:33:30,147 --> 01:33:32,899
- Hong Kong?
- Hong Kong. Brazil. South Africa.

1003
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:36,111
It doesn't matter.
What matters is us, together.

1004
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:38,155
Listen...

1005
01:33:38,614 --> 01:33:43,577
I've been doing three, four hits a year,
for the last few years, most of them, full pay.

1006
01:33:44,745 --> 01:33:46,038
That many?

1007
01:33:46,747 --> 01:33:50,292
It's not many if you consider
the size of the population.

1008
01:33:50,542 --> 01:33:53,920
The thing is, I got almost $1 million...

1009
01:33:54,463 --> 01:33:56,840
in a safe-deposit box on the coast.

1010
01:33:56,923 --> 01:34:00,969
You must have at least that much put away.
We can take all the money and run.

1011
01:34:01,053 --> 01:34:04,806
We can go where we want, do what we want.
We can be together all the time.

1012
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:07,476
Please, Charley, let's just go
before they get us.

1013
01:34:07,559 --> 01:34:09,519
They're not gonna get us.

1014
01:34:10,437 --> 01:34:12,189
Piss on the Prizzis.

1015
01:34:13,065 --> 01:34:15,150
These people can't win all the time.

1016
01:34:15,233 --> 01:34:18,153
There has to be a way
to beat them bastards.

1017
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:24,910
Let's call Pop.

1018
01:34:26,828 --> 01:34:31,166
And the Don told you to keep
making you Boss a secret from me?

1019
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:32,501
Yeah.

1020
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:37,631
And he told you he's letting you off
for giving him back the money?

1021
01:34:37,881 --> 01:34:39,841
- Plus 50 percent.
- Right.

1022
01:34:41,009 --> 01:34:44,638
And Dominic gave you a $50,000
down payment to hit Charley?

1023
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:47,015
Absolutely. Brand new bills.

1024
01:34:59,277 --> 01:35:02,489
He's hot. I never seen him this hot.

1025
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:24,845
It's just business, Charley. Just business.

1026
01:35:26,304 --> 01:35:27,931
What are we gonna do?

1027
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:30,809
You have to take away the only thing
the Don wants.

1028
01:35:30,892 --> 01:35:35,188
Filargi, golden Filargi.
You have to snatch Filargi again.

1029
01:35:35,439 --> 01:35:37,107
This time from the Prizzis.

1030
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:39,609
How many people you got there
holding Filargi down?

1031
01:35:39,693 --> 01:35:42,654
Two. My people.
They do whatever I tell them.

1032
01:35:42,863 --> 01:35:45,699
Good. Filargi's worth $70 million...

1033
01:35:46,074 --> 01:35:49,828
maybe more to the Prizzis,
including the bank.

1034
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:54,291
What are you next to $70 million? Nothing.

1035
01:35:55,250 --> 01:35:57,085
He'll take whatever deal you offer.

1036
01:35:57,169 --> 01:35:59,838
- Yeah. No choice, right?
- Right, no choice.

1037
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:03,091
They know we can let Filargi go
and testify against them.

1038
01:36:03,341 --> 01:36:04,968
Or even worse...

1039
01:36:06,052 --> 01:36:09,848
you can turn and go into the government's
Witness Protection Program...

1040
01:36:09,931 --> 01:36:12,642
and testify against the Don and Dominic.

1041
01:36:12,726 --> 01:36:16,271
To a jury, the cold facts would be,
you shot the police captain's wife...

1042
01:36:16,354 --> 01:36:21,109
on orders from the Don and Dominic,
after they hired you to do it for $150,000.

1043
01:36:21,777 --> 01:36:24,654
You're very dangerous to the Prizzis, Irene.

1044
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:26,239
Yeah.

1045
01:36:26,990 --> 01:36:31,161
It could turn out to be a good thing
Irene zipped the police captain's wife.

1046
01:36:31,286 --> 01:36:33,580
It could solve all our problems.

1047
01:37:31,429 --> 01:37:34,891
<i>We are here tonight to honor my son.</i>

1048
01:37:36,101 --> 01:37:37,978
<i>He's gonna leave us...</i>

1049
01:37:38,687 --> 01:37:42,148
<i>to live in a $935,000 house...</i>

1050
01:37:42,232 --> 01:37:46,903
<i>next to his own golf course
in Las Vegas, Nevada.</i>

1051
01:37:49,531 --> 01:37:51,783
<i>And I say to him, for you...</i>

1052
01:37:52,868 --> 01:37:54,494
<i>from my heart...</i>

1053
01:37:55,328 --> 01:37:56,788
<i>God speed you.</i>

1054
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,917
<i>God bless you, Dominic.</i>

1055
01:38:05,964 --> 01:38:08,008
<i>And I want to present you...</i>

1056
01:38:08,174 --> 01:38:12,804
<i>with these tokens of the esteem
of your entire family.</i>

1057
01:38:14,264 --> 01:38:16,474
<i>It's a going-away present...</i>

1058
01:38:22,981 --> 01:38:26,276
<i>a complete set of sterling silver golf clubs.</i>

1059
01:38:28,862 --> 01:38:31,907
<i>Now, that bag is made out of
a hide of an elephant.</i>

1060
01:38:32,032 --> 01:38:34,701
<i>Its the only one in the United States.</i>

1061
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:39,039
<i>And 1,000 of your favorite Mexican cigars.</i>

1062
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:46,129
<i>Now we're gonna have a song,
in celebration of this grand occasion.</i>

1063
01:38:46,212 --> 01:38:49,299
<i>The great tenor, Tomasino Baratta.</i>

1064
01:39:40,266 --> 01:39:41,601
Get moving.

1065
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:48,608
Holy shit, Boss.
Somebody done the job on Zingo.

1066
01:40:40,368 --> 01:40:41,870
The Boccas.

1067
01:40:43,038 --> 01:40:46,124
This killing of the police captain's wife...

1068
01:40:46,207 --> 01:40:49,002
is costing us all too much.

1069
01:40:57,260 --> 01:40:59,596
I got something to read to you.

1070
01:41:01,014 --> 01:41:02,557
It's a letter.

1071
01:41:02,974 --> 01:41:04,934
A letter? Who from?

1072
01:41:07,020 --> 01:41:08,271
Charley.

1073
01:41:11,232 --> 01:41:12,609
You all set?

1074
01:41:16,529 --> 01:41:18,114
"Dear Eduardo...

1075
01:41:18,198 --> 01:41:21,618
"you're probably hot right now
because we took Filargi.

1076
01:41:21,701 --> 01:41:23,787
"But when you hear the reason why...

1077
01:41:23,912 --> 01:41:28,333
"you and the Don are gonna understand
there was no other way we could go.

1078
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:31,461
"Dominic put out a contract on me."

1079
01:41:36,341 --> 01:41:39,344
- He's a fucking liar.
- You want to hear the letter?

1080
01:41:39,427 --> 01:41:43,056
Listen, don't talk. There's about
$130 million here, maybe more.

1081
01:41:43,181 --> 01:41:47,143
We've got to renegotiate it before
we get it back. Just shut up and listen.

1082
01:41:47,227 --> 01:41:48,686
Go on, sit down.

1083
01:41:54,109 --> 01:41:56,945
"Dominic will say it's a lot a bullshit.

1084
01:41:59,447 --> 01:42:04,452
"But it so happens he hired my own wife,
and he gave her a down payment of $50,000.

1085
01:42:04,911 --> 01:42:08,957
"My wife is sitting here next to me,
and she's laughing like hell.

1086
01:42:09,374 --> 01:42:12,919
"I personally think
the Don found Dominic on a doorstep...

1087
01:42:13,002 --> 01:42:16,339
"because Dominic is 50 times too dumb
to be a Prizzi.

1088
01:42:24,389 --> 01:42:28,101
"The first thing I got to have
before you get Filargi back...

1089
01:42:28,685 --> 01:42:31,312
"is that you deliver Dominic to me...

1090
01:42:31,771 --> 01:42:34,399
"where I tell you, and when I tell you."

1091
01:42:34,482 --> 01:42:37,443
This time, no contract. I'll kill him myself.

1092
01:42:37,819 --> 01:42:40,947
Listen to the letter, Dominic, will you?
Come on.

1093
01:42:48,121 --> 01:42:50,915
"For the main money, this is what I want:

1094
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:55,253
"$2,314,000 for expenses...

1095
01:42:56,379 --> 01:42:58,882
"then $50,000 for my helper...

1096
01:43:00,091 --> 01:43:05,054
"of course, the $150,000 promised to my
wife, as second man in the Filargi stand."

1097
01:43:06,389 --> 01:43:08,516
Charley's wife was the second man?

1098
01:43:08,600 --> 01:43:11,936
Right. She was the only way
we could take out the bodyguard.

1099
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:15,523
"Then I want all of the insurance coverage
on Filargi's kidnap policy...

1100
01:43:15,648 --> 01:43:16,941
"which is $2.5 million."

1101
01:43:17,025 --> 01:43:19,360
My God, he's a real businessman.

1102
01:43:19,444 --> 01:43:20,737
That's my boy.

1103
01:43:20,820 --> 01:43:24,282
We've got to make him a counteroffer,
and eventually we settle.

1104
01:43:24,365 --> 01:43:25,992
The way I see it...

1105
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:30,663
we get about $60-70 million,
and only about 5.9 percent sales cost...

1106
01:43:30,747 --> 01:43:33,499
if we give Charley everything he wants,
which we won't.

1107
01:43:33,583 --> 01:43:36,294
And I am part of the fucking sales cost.

1108
01:43:37,378 --> 01:43:41,257
Dominic, you take some
blood-pressure medicine, will you?

1109
01:43:41,716 --> 01:43:45,428
Charley is just making a point.
Everything is negotiable.

1110
01:43:47,513 --> 01:43:49,599
We go over to Papa's...

1111
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,518
we hash this thing out.

1112
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:55,855
Come on, Dominic. Up, let's go.

1113
01:45:33,161 --> 01:45:35,413
- Somebody is dead?
- Yes.

1114
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:37,373
Who? Who's dead?

1115
01:45:42,003 --> 01:45:43,212
Dominic.

1116
01:45:48,343 --> 01:45:50,053
The Boccas again?

1117
01:45:57,393 --> 01:45:59,395
Poor Dominic.

1118
01:46:02,357 --> 01:46:03,816
He got old.

1119
01:46:04,317 --> 01:46:06,069
Something happened.

1120
01:46:08,279 --> 01:46:10,907
Maybe it was his daughter, who knows?

1121
01:46:13,493 --> 01:46:16,204
But he agreed to retire...

1122
01:46:17,038 --> 01:46:19,290
and I give the job to Charley.

1123
01:46:22,043 --> 01:46:25,254
I told him to keep it a secret a little while...

1124
01:46:25,713 --> 01:46:29,967
until Dominic's banquet. It's all right.

1125
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:35,681
Now, Charley's all mixed up,
and we've got to get him back.

1126
01:46:36,474 --> 01:46:39,519
Only Charley
can hold everything together here.

1127
01:46:57,662 --> 01:46:59,247
How you doing, Pop?

1128
01:46:59,330 --> 01:47:01,999
- I'm fine. Everything all right?
- Yeah.

1129
01:47:02,583 --> 01:47:04,377
Everything's quiet out here.

1130
01:47:04,627 --> 01:47:06,170
Mezza mezza, huh?

1131
01:47:07,797 --> 01:47:12,635
Sorry to drag you out here, Pop, but I didn't
want anyone taking a potshot at me.

1132
01:47:13,261 --> 01:47:16,347
When I told the Don about Dominic
putting out a contract on you...

1133
01:47:16,431 --> 01:47:19,308
- it knocked him out. He couldn't believe it.
- Yeah?

1134
01:47:19,392 --> 01:47:24,147
He told me with tears in his eyes,
he's got to straighten all this out with you.

1135
01:47:25,731 --> 01:47:27,900
Then he wasn't setting me up?

1136
01:47:28,693 --> 01:47:33,531
He said, and I know him for 50 years,
so I know he was looking into his heart...

1137
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:36,409
he said, "We need Charley."

1138
01:47:38,411 --> 01:47:39,871
He said that?

1139
01:47:41,164 --> 01:47:45,501
The Don and me don't have much time left.
The family has to keep going.

1140
01:47:45,835 --> 01:47:48,337
You're the only one that can run it.

1141
01:47:50,631 --> 01:47:54,343
Then everything's okay?
We don't have to hang on to Filargi.

1142
01:47:54,802 --> 01:47:57,138
The Don gave his guarantee.

1143
01:47:59,724 --> 01:48:01,684
Tomorrow morning at 10:00...

1144
01:48:01,767 --> 01:48:05,313
you bring Filargi to 42nd Street library
and let him out.

1145
01:48:05,396 --> 01:48:09,400
I'll tip off the cops and the FBI.
They'll be in his hotel room.

1146
01:48:09,484 --> 01:48:11,527
Okay, Pop. Want the paper?

1147
01:48:11,819 --> 01:48:13,738
I read it from cover to cover.

1148
01:48:13,821 --> 01:48:16,908
- Jupiter's Accord, sixth at Belmont.
- Okay.

1149
01:48:17,867 --> 01:48:20,786
By the way, the insurance company paid off.

1150
01:48:22,079 --> 01:48:24,373
Take care of yourself, Charley.

1151
01:48:37,553 --> 01:48:39,722
How we gonna take Filargi in?

1152
01:48:40,681 --> 01:48:43,935
Pop's sending someone up
on the Palisades to meet us.

1153
01:48:45,311 --> 01:48:48,856
We'll transfer him to the van there,
and I'll drive him into the city.

1154
01:48:48,940 --> 01:48:52,860
You stick with the plumber,
he'll drop you off at the apartment.

1155
01:48:55,112 --> 01:48:57,490
Tell me about the money, Charley.

1156
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:03,037
My end is $2.5 million,
plus I'm boss of the Prizzis...

1157
01:49:03,120 --> 01:49:06,582
with heavy points
in everything the family does.

1158
01:49:08,626 --> 01:49:12,588
This time next week,
we'll have all the money.

1159
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:15,633
You mean you're gonna
turn over our whole ball of wax...

1160
01:49:15,716 --> 01:49:19,929
to some Sicilians who are gonna pay you
what they owe you next week?

1161
01:49:20,263 --> 01:49:25,059
Honey, I'm the boss. They need me.
I've got to believe Pop.

1162
01:49:25,142 --> 01:49:27,728
They're not gonna screw us over now.

1163
01:49:27,895 --> 01:49:30,398
Maybe Pop's in there
looking after your interests...

1164
01:49:30,523 --> 01:49:33,734
but that doesn't necessarily mean
he's looking after mine.

1165
01:49:33,818 --> 01:49:37,113
There's a real pressure
to turn over the second man.

1166
01:49:37,863 --> 01:49:41,242
- You're my wife.
- I'm your Polack wife.

1167
01:49:41,659 --> 01:49:44,245
Irene, will you shape up? Jesus!

1168
01:49:45,496 --> 01:49:47,915
Okay, I'll shape up.

1169
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:50,626
As soon as I get my $900,000.

1170
01:49:52,545 --> 01:49:54,630
What $900,000?

1171
01:49:54,797 --> 01:49:57,425
The $720,000 from the Vegas scam...

1172
01:49:57,508 --> 01:50:01,846
plus the $180,000 that Don
made me pay as penalty. That's $900,000.

1173
01:50:02,096 --> 01:50:04,056
I just want what's mine.

1174
01:50:05,141 --> 01:50:09,103
That's Prizzi money, honey, not yours.
You stole it.

1175
01:50:09,270 --> 01:50:13,566
The Prizzis got theirs back from
the insurance company. I just want it back.

1176
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:17,069
That ain't gonna make no sense
to the Prizzis, honey.

1177
01:50:17,153 --> 01:50:20,573
Remember the words
of the late great Marxie Heller:

1178
01:50:20,865 --> 01:50:24,160
"We'd rather eat our children
than part with money."

1179
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:27,496
You remember those words, honey.

1180
01:50:28,122 --> 01:50:31,042
I am, Charley.

1181
01:50:41,093 --> 01:50:42,595
Mr. Filargi...

1182
01:50:43,971 --> 01:50:46,557
you were born a poor kid in Naples, right?

1183
01:50:46,641 --> 01:50:48,351
Yeah, that's right.

1184
01:50:49,226 --> 01:50:51,228
You remember the Camorra?

1185
01:50:53,814 --> 01:50:56,484
The Camorra was small, we're very big.

1186
01:50:57,151 --> 01:50:59,445
There's nowhere we can't go.

1187
01:51:00,196 --> 01:51:04,867
They could lock you in a steel room, in a
submarine on the bottom of the ocean floor.

1188
01:51:04,950 --> 01:51:06,702
We'd still get to you.

1189
01:51:07,620 --> 01:51:09,747
Cops are gonna talk to you.

1190
01:51:10,706 --> 01:51:14,502
You tell them anything about who took you,
or where you thought we took you...

1191
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:17,296
we're <i>gonna</i> kill <i>you, capisce?</i>

1192
01:51:18,381 --> 01:51:19,840
I understand.

1193
01:51:21,133 --> 01:51:22,218
Good.

1194
01:51:24,345 --> 01:51:26,847
You're free, Mr. Filargi. Good luck.

1195
01:51:29,642 --> 01:51:30,726
Yeah.

1196
01:51:35,272 --> 01:51:37,775
I've forgotten the Prizzis already.

1197
01:51:39,985 --> 01:51:43,906
I got a request to make, or Irene has.

1198
01:51:45,825 --> 01:51:48,035
What kind of request, Charley?

1199
01:51:48,369 --> 01:51:50,329
She wants her money back.

1200
01:51:51,080 --> 01:51:52,456
What money?

1201
01:51:53,207 --> 01:51:56,419
The $540,000 she gave you for the Don...

1202
01:51:56,836 --> 01:52:01,298
plus the $360,000 I took the night
I zipped Marxie Heller. That money.

1203
01:52:02,049 --> 01:52:06,595
She's willing to forget about the $2.5 million
from Filargi's insurance...

1204
01:52:07,221 --> 01:52:11,350
and the rest of what Dominic owed her
for the contract on me.

1205
01:52:13,894 --> 01:52:16,105
But she wants her $900,000 back.

1206
01:52:24,447 --> 01:52:28,033
With all due respect, Charley,
the wife must be cracked.

1207
01:52:29,577 --> 01:52:32,204
Try to see it from her point of view.

1208
01:52:32,538 --> 01:52:37,376
I mean, you agreed to all that stuff
in the letter we sent, when we had Filargi.

1209
01:52:38,753 --> 01:52:40,838
You made a commitment, Pop.

1210
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:45,134
Anyways, it was Irene's moves...

1211
01:52:45,259 --> 01:52:47,970
that got Filargi out in the first place.

1212
01:52:48,679 --> 01:52:53,392
We're gonna get the bank, so
$900,000 doesn't seem like so much money.

1213
01:52:53,809 --> 01:52:56,228
Irene figures she's got it coming.

1214
01:52:59,148 --> 01:53:03,068
Yeah, I'm glad that she's so foolish
and grasping.

1215
01:53:04,153 --> 01:53:07,072
Makes it a little easier, what we got to do.

1216
01:53:11,744 --> 01:53:14,330
The family decided...

1217
01:53:14,538 --> 01:53:18,209
that we've got to give
the second man to the cops.

1218
01:53:22,129 --> 01:53:24,006
Give Irene to the cops?

1219
01:53:25,132 --> 01:53:28,344
The family decided that we got one week...

1220
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:32,598
to give up the second man,
or we'll be at war.

1221
01:53:33,641 --> 01:53:37,144
War would cost us everything we got.

1222
01:53:37,645 --> 01:53:40,481
Now, that could mean the end of the family.

1223
01:53:41,857 --> 01:53:42,858
<i>But, Padrino--</i>

1224
01:53:42,942 --> 01:53:46,612
Charley, you shouldn't have married
a woman that wasn't in the environment...

1225
01:53:46,695 --> 01:53:48,072
that wasn't smart.

1226
01:53:48,155 --> 01:53:51,867
Might have been all right if she was straight,
but she wasn't.

1227
01:53:56,497 --> 01:53:57,998
She got to go...

1228
01:53:59,542 --> 01:54:02,503
and you got to do the job on her, Charley.

1229
01:54:02,795 --> 01:54:06,048
You're the only one
who could get close enough to do it.

1230
01:54:07,049 --> 01:54:08,425
Zotz Irene?

1231
01:54:09,969 --> 01:54:11,345
Clip Irene?

1232
01:54:11,887 --> 01:54:16,308
If they take her alive, they're gonna
make her talk, and then, if she talks...

1233
01:54:16,725 --> 01:54:20,271
she's gonna drag us all to jail,
maybe even to the chair.

1234
01:54:21,564 --> 01:54:24,817
Filargi will go free.
We will never get the bank.

1235
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,819
There is no choice here.

1236
01:54:30,781 --> 01:54:34,034
How is doing a number on Irene
gonna satisfy the cops...

1237
01:54:34,118 --> 01:54:36,704
about the broad
that pushed the wrong button?

1238
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:42,793
Filargi will identify your wife's body.
There will be no one to question.

1239
01:54:43,878 --> 01:54:48,465
Everybody will get what they want,
and we can all go back to doing business.

1240
01:54:50,217 --> 01:54:51,719
But, Padrino...

1241
01:54:53,053 --> 01:54:54,930
she's my wife.

1242
01:54:55,472 --> 01:54:57,099
I can't kill her.

1243
01:55:00,728 --> 01:55:02,938
You swore an oath of blood...

1244
01:55:03,856 --> 01:55:05,608
my blood and yours...

1245
01:55:05,816 --> 01:55:10,654
that you would always put the family
before anything else in your life.

1246
01:55:12,781 --> 01:55:17,411
So we are calling on you now
to keep that sacred oath.

1247
01:55:19,914 --> 01:55:24,376
Irene is my family, Padrino, she's my wife.

1248
01:55:24,752 --> 01:55:28,505
Charley, she is a woman you have known
for only a few weeks.

1249
01:55:29,048 --> 01:55:32,176
She is your wife, we are your life.

1250
01:55:32,593 --> 01:55:34,595
You failed in your oath...

1251
01:55:36,263 --> 01:55:39,516
when you covered up for her part
in the Vegas scam.

1252
01:55:41,310 --> 01:55:42,811
A great sin...

1253
01:55:43,896 --> 01:55:45,648
against your honor.

1254
01:55:47,274 --> 01:55:49,610
For this, you must atone.

1255
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:51,612
I need her.

1256
01:55:55,157 --> 01:55:56,659
Look at you.

1257
01:55:59,411 --> 01:56:01,914
You've been alone since Mama died.

1258
01:56:04,375 --> 01:56:07,711
You, Padrino, you've been alone all my life.

1259
01:56:09,964 --> 01:56:13,300
Is that what you want for me,
to grow old, like you...

1260
01:56:13,968 --> 01:56:18,013
with nothing but bodyguards
and money to keep me company?

1261
01:56:22,518 --> 01:56:24,561
Charley, my beloved man...

1262
01:56:26,355 --> 01:56:28,607
you will be even more alone...

1263
01:56:29,942 --> 01:56:33,696
if you turn your back on us.
We are your blood.

1264
01:56:37,658 --> 01:56:40,703
I feel like I'm drowning or something.
I mean...

1265
01:56:42,287 --> 01:56:45,082
I covered up the Vegas scam to protect her.

1266
01:56:45,666 --> 01:56:50,379
That's what I thought we did for our women.
How could that be a sin against honor?

1267
01:56:50,963 --> 01:56:53,632
She is a hitter and a thief!

1268
01:56:54,383 --> 01:56:56,385
You must give her to us.

1269
01:56:57,136 --> 01:56:58,887
What is your answer?

1270
01:57:33,172 --> 01:57:37,634
The family is the only place I can be.
I know that.

1271
01:57:55,069 --> 01:57:58,280
It's business, Charley. It's only business.

1272
01:58:26,141 --> 01:58:29,978
Everything's okay. The Don's gonna
give you your money back...

1273
01:58:30,437 --> 01:58:32,981
the whole $900,000. I got it right here.

1274
01:58:33,065 --> 01:58:35,818
The Don's giving money back? Since when?

1275
01:58:37,152 --> 01:58:40,781
Yeah, you could've knocked me over.
That ain't all.

1276
01:58:41,615 --> 01:58:45,077
He's gonna pay you every dime,
the Filargi stand...

1277
01:58:46,328 --> 01:58:48,205
and what Dominic said.

1278
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:50,290
<i>How about that?</i>

1279
01:58:51,125 --> 01:58:52,126
Oh Charely!

1280
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:54,837
Well.

1281
01:58:55,796 --> 01:58:58,048
I'm glad everything's settled.

1282
01:59:01,385 --> 01:59:03,846
<i>I just wanted you to know...</i>

1283
01:59:04,972 --> 01:59:07,474
<i>everything is 100-percent okay.</i>

1284
01:59:12,062 --> 01:59:13,355
Marxie...

1285
01:59:15,065 --> 01:59:16,859
I should have listened.

1286
02:00:00,444 --> 02:00:04,823
After you take the stone out of my shoe...

1287
02:00:05,949 --> 02:00:10,495
you call your father
and tell him where he can get her...

1288
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:14,249
and then the wind will stop blowing.

1289
02:00:15,667 --> 02:00:17,920
Charley, here's $900,000.

1290
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:40,692
Next, what's the first flight out of LAX
in the morning to Hong Kong?

1291
02:00:41,902 --> 02:00:45,113
Flight 009, leaving at 10:45 a.m.

1292
02:00:45,572 --> 02:00:47,699
We can get you to Hong Kong tonight
out of LAX.

1293
02:00:47,783 --> 02:00:50,118
No, thanks, I have to go
to the bank in the morning.

1294
02:00:50,202 --> 02:00:54,873
Reserve 009 then. One seat, one way,
first class. The name is Hilary Jackson.

1295
02:00:55,415 --> 02:00:57,167
Mrs. Hilary Jackson.

1296
02:01:11,723 --> 02:01:13,767
<i>This is the final boarding call...</i>

1297
02:01:13,850 --> 02:01:17,688
<i>for Pan Am Flight 811
to Los Angeles at Gate 22.</i>

1298
02:01:18,188 --> 02:01:21,233
<i>All passengers should be on board
at this time.</i>

1299
02:02:53,283 --> 02:02:54,284
Irene?

1300
02:02:55,994 --> 02:02:56,995
Irene?

1301
02:02:57,704 --> 02:02:59,623
Look who's here!

1302
02:03:05,087 --> 02:03:07,923
Charley, what a wonderful surprise!

1303
02:03:08,090 --> 02:03:13,011
Baby, I got three whole days,
anything you want, you name it.

1304
02:03:16,139 --> 02:03:18,392
Baby, we are gonna have a ball.

1305
02:03:18,558 --> 02:03:22,396
Yeah, that's just the half of it, sugar.
Get over there.

1306
02:03:52,092 --> 02:03:55,095
Jesus, what a beautiful song.

1307
02:03:57,639 --> 02:04:01,268
Why don't you go and warm up the bed?
I'll be right there.

1308
02:06:05,642 --> 02:06:06,643
Mae?

1309
02:06:07,102 --> 02:06:08,102
Charley.

1310
02:06:08,103 --> 02:06:09,437
<i>Charley, you know what?</i>

1311
02:06:09,521 --> 02:06:13,108
<i>My sister, Theresa,
just got back today from her honeymoon.</i>

1312
02:06:14,401 --> 02:06:16,611
Where did they go? Outer space?

1313
02:06:19,906 --> 02:06:21,533
What do you say...

1314
02:06:22,284 --> 02:06:24,244
we go to dinner tonight?

1315
02:06:24,327 --> 02:06:25,287
Dinner?

1316
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:30,458
What do you mean?

1317
02:06:30,542 --> 02:06:31,751
<i>What do I mean?</i>

1318
02:06:31,835 --> 02:06:35,130
<i>I mean, let's go someplace
and get something to eat.</i>

1319
02:06:35,255 --> 02:06:36,965
You and me and Irene?

1320
02:06:37,048 --> 02:06:38,008
No.

1321
02:06:39,342 --> 02:06:40,927
Just you and me.

1322
02:06:41,970 --> 02:06:43,638
<i>What about Irene?</i>

1323
02:06:44,973 --> 02:06:47,976
She had to go away, she won't be back.

1324
02:06:51,646 --> 02:06:54,107
<i>- How about it?
- How about it?</i>

1325
02:06:54,858 --> 02:06:58,236
Holy cow, Charley,
just tell me where you want to meet.
