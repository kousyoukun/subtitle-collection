1
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:23,734
Angelo!
My oldest, dearest friend.

2
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:25,606
Your son!

3
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:29,227
He lost his mother,
but he's got another father.

4
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:31,951
I'm his father now, with you.

5
00:00:32,838 --> 00:00:39,424
I'll be as one with you,
protecting his future.

6
00:00:41,272 --> 00:00:43,840
We're honoured,
Don Padrone.

7
00:01:27,072 --> 00:01:30,987
Raise the first finger
of your right hand.

8
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:13,908
This drop of blood symbolizes
your birth into our family.

9
00:02:14,123 --> 00:02:18,897
We're one,
until death.

10
00:02:19,923 --> 00:02:21,642
We'll protect you...

11
00:02:21,826 --> 00:02:25,805
so much you protect
Prizzi's honour.

12
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:30,357
- Do you swear it?
- Yeah.

13
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:38,936
Now that you have sealed a truly
Christian marriage...

14
00:07:39,071 --> 00:07:42,282
give these wedding rings to each
other saying after me:

15
00:07:42,529 --> 00:07:47,410
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

16
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,354
take and wear this ring...

17
00:07:50,476 --> 00:07:52,932
as a sign of my love...

18
00:07:53,085 --> 00:07:55,009
and fidelity.

19
00:07:55,605 --> 00:08:01,520
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

20
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:04,444
take and wear this ring...

21
00:08:04,581 --> 00:08:06,616
as a sign of my love...

22
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,494
and fidelity.

23
00:08:08,756 --> 00:08:12,670
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

24
00:09:16,308 --> 00:09:18,770
Hey, you know that girl up there...

25
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:23,189
blonde, lavender gloves?

26
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:25,337
Look pal
I'd like to help you but...

27
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:28,344
I gotta take shots of the notables,
the bishops...

28
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:30,396
Mr. Partanna,
what can I do for you?

29
00:09:30,496 --> 00:09:33,654
I want shots of that girl up there
in the lavender gloves.

30
00:09:33,838 --> 00:09:36,421
You got it,
my pleasure.

31
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,436
Take care of yourselves.

32
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,149
Don't tell me that
was Charley Partanna.

33
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:47,218
- Himself.
- Holy shit.

34
00:10:06,724 --> 00:10:09,406
Hey, give me a ride over
to the reception, will ya'?

35
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:12,905
There's over half a dozen veal
steaks on the Prizzi meat counter.

36
00:10:13,059 --> 00:10:16,274
You got it Charley, jump in.

37
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,559
Ok, quiet down!
Quiet down!

38
00:10:58,202 --> 00:11:01,947
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother Eduardo and I...

39
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:07,241
would like to introduce you to a man
who needs no introduction:

40
00:11:07,764 --> 00:11:10,049
Our father
your dear friend...

41
00:11:10,632 --> 00:11:13,264
a legend to his people:

42
00:11:13,776 --> 00:11:16,478
Don Corrado Prizzi.

43
00:11:30,935 --> 00:11:34,472
My father welcomes all of you
to this great family occasion...

44
00:11:34,609 --> 00:11:36,687
and he says that you should
all have a great time.

45
00:11:37,116 --> 00:11:38,958
He offers his toast of love...

46
00:11:39,203 --> 00:11:41,320
to the happiness of the bride
and groom...

47
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:44,605
and he wishes them
many children.

48
00:11:47,342 --> 00:11:49,712
Thanks to you all.

49
00:12:38,219 --> 00:12:42,109
Excuse me would you care
to dance?

50
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,621
Yes.

51
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:15,843
Some spread, huh?

52
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:18,140
Haven't I seen you
before?

53
00:13:18,736 --> 00:13:20,813
I'm sure I'd remember.

54
00:13:21,644 --> 00:13:22,902
I mean...

55
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:26,647
maybe's you were at the marry
mountain with the bride...

56
00:13:28,046 --> 00:13:29,664
I could never miss you.

57
00:13:29,991 --> 00:13:31,532
And you are?

58
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:34,423
Charley Partanna,
pleased to meet you.

59
00:13:34,687 --> 00:13:37,012
Miss, Miss!
Telephone lady!

60
00:13:37,356 --> 00:13:39,474
- Telephone?
- I'll be right back.

61
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:01,435
Hello, Aunt Amalia!

62
00:14:03,951 --> 00:14:05,553
Maerose!

63
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:10,328
Pop actually invited me
to my own sisters wedding.

64
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:12,374
Imagine that.

65
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,890
He must be getting soft in his old age.

66
00:14:15,012 --> 00:14:17,510
Cara, let me look at ya'.

67
00:14:20,483 --> 00:14:22,310
So Aunt Amalia
what do you think?

68
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:23,636
Such a one.

69
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,402
Always making
a show of yourself.

70
00:14:26,538 --> 00:14:30,160
Come on Aunt Amalia,
I got a reputation to live up to.

71
00:14:30,296 --> 00:14:32,106
I'm the family scandal.

72
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,878
Everybody be disappointed
if I stopped.

73
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:38,828
Have you paid your respects
to your father yet?

74
00:14:46,704 --> 00:14:49,271
- Do I have to?
- Sure you have to.

75
00:14:49,627 --> 00:14:52,079
Come on, lets' go together.

76
00:14:58,407 --> 00:14:59,788
Hello Pappa!

77
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:02,212
Dominic! Dominic!

78
00:15:02,366 --> 00:15:04,084
She came to pay you her respects.

79
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:05,680
Speak to her!

80
00:15:05,926 --> 00:15:08,411
Then how come she ain't
dressed right...

81
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:10,283
If she's so respectful?

82
00:15:10,683 --> 00:15:13,786
How come she show's up
at a family wedding...

83
00:15:13,886 --> 00:15:15,794
dressed like a Badonna Dialo?

84
00:15:17,306 --> 00:15:20,720
Don't worry Aunt Amalia,
he'll get his one day.

85
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,216
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

86
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:08,640
Where's the lady
you took to the telephone?

87
00:16:09,452 --> 00:16:11,280
Where's the lady
you took to the telephone?

88
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:13,409
How should I know mister?

89
00:16:13,712 --> 00:16:15,163
Who told you to go get her?

90
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,616
Some old guy, I don't know.

91
00:16:18,806 --> 00:16:20,215
An old guy.

92
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,635
Ok.
Here.

93
00:16:22,619 --> 00:16:24,223
Watch out for them conolli's.

94
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,025
Thanks mister.

95
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,653
Hello Charley.

96
00:16:30,955 --> 00:16:33,032
- Hi Maerose.
- Hi.

97
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:36,706
- How are you Mae?
- Fine Charley, and you?

98
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:38,978
Fine too.

99
00:16:40,264 --> 00:16:44,499
So how's the decorating
business?

100
00:16:44,684 --> 00:16:47,352
Oh, it's just great Charley,
we're always busy.

101
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:49,273
Everything is art deco now.

102
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:50,409
Art who?

103
00:16:50,638 --> 00:16:53,825
You know art deco,
after art nouveau.

104
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,121
It's a style it's not a person.

105
00:16:57,512 --> 00:17:00,264
Like all that art stuff.

106
00:17:07,487 --> 00:17:09,020
God!
Damn!

107
00:17:11,286 --> 00:17:13,808
What's the matter Mae?

108
00:17:14,877 --> 00:17:17,079
I should have known to stay away.

109
00:17:17,215 --> 00:17:18,625
What happened?

110
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:24,135
I went to say hello to my father,
and he called me a whore.

111
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,268
Maerose, I'm sorry.

112
00:17:31,326 --> 00:17:34,570
Listen Mae what you gotta do
is forget about your father.

113
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,156
Forget about the alignment.

114
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:38,080
They never gonna take you back
anyway.

115
00:17:38,215 --> 00:17:40,502
So screw them.
They don't deserve you.

116
00:17:42,223 --> 00:17:46,304
Especially that fucking Dominic.

117
00:17:48,594 --> 00:17:51,130
Mae, you are still beautiful.

118
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:55,388
Why don't you find yourself someone
who has nothing to do with the family?

119
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:58,896
Settle down,
couple of kids.

120
00:17:59,115 --> 00:18:00,517
A life.

121
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,617
Practice your meatballs.

122
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:09,790
Sure Charley.
Thanks a lot.

123
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,591
You're a big help.

124
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:33,797
Are you the guy
who took the pictures?

125
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:34,895
Yeah.

126
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:37,651
- So when do I get to see them?
- They're in the lab, Mr. Partanna.

127
00:18:37,776 --> 00:18:39,934
I'll make sure I get them to you
as soon as they're out.

128
00:18:40,034 --> 00:18:41,220
About noon tomorrow.

129
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:44,018
- Ok, meanwhile give me her name.
- Her name?

130
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:49,455
- Yeah her name, for Christ's sake.
- Mr. Partanna I didn't get no name.

131
00:18:49,842 --> 00:18:51,418
I thought you knew her.

132
00:18:51,554 --> 00:18:52,921
Oh for Christ's sake's!

133
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:14,465
- Hello.
- Mae.

134
00:19:14,999 --> 00:19:19,050
She ain't here.
You wanna leave a message?

135
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:22,565
- Who is this?
- This is the girl.

136
00:19:22,868 --> 00:19:25,613
Ask her, this is very important.

137
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,932
Ask her if she knows a woman
at the wedding...

138
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:30,835
who wore a lavender dress.

139
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:34,456
- You got it?
- I got it.

140
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:37,126
Make sure she calls me.
You hear?

141
00:19:37,372 --> 00:19:41,392
Now what's your name?
I'm gonna send you ten bucks.

142
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:45,658
Ten bucks?
Miss Peaches.

143
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,561
Ok, Peaches.

144
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:50,814
You tell Miss Prizzi
she has to call me...

145
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:52,959
no matter how late, tonight.

146
00:19:53,094 --> 00:19:56,007
- Ok.
- Peaches thank you.

147
00:19:56,142 --> 00:19:57,143
Bye, bye.

148
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:18,761
Hey Partanna!

149
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:21,975
Gallagher!
Homicide!

150
00:20:23,447 --> 00:20:25,358
What's up?

151
00:20:25,493 --> 00:20:27,821
Somebody tagged Sally
Turbino this afternoon.

152
00:20:28,499 --> 00:20:29,501
Yeah?

153
00:20:30,044 --> 00:20:31,203
Who dunnit?

154
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,708
Where were you between
two and five today?

155
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:36,664
I was at the wedding.

156
00:20:37,032 --> 00:20:39,978
Corrado Prizzi's
granddaughter's wedding.

157
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,312
They're all gonna turn out
to be at the wedding.

158
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:47,349
Come on!
We're taking you in!

159
00:21:00,325 --> 00:21:02,258
You couldn't be cleaner?

160
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:05,020
- Who made the hit bob?
- We did.

161
00:21:05,235 --> 00:21:08,857
We did? How come we did?
I don't know nothing about it.

162
00:21:14,509 --> 00:21:17,849
Well that's the best way in it.

163
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:19,382
Who hit him?

164
00:21:19,519 --> 00:21:22,298
I don't tell.
It was a specialist job.

165
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:23,864
How come?

166
00:21:24,262 --> 00:21:27,270
Dominic told me to set it up so
he couldn't have nothing to do with it.

167
00:21:27,535 --> 00:21:29,486
We was all at the wedding.

168
00:21:42,277 --> 00:21:44,671
- Mae?
- Charley?

169
00:21:45,008 --> 00:21:46,450
Did you have any luck?

170
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:49,098
What kind of a message was that?

171
00:21:49,396 --> 00:21:52,528
Who can remember
a girl in a lavender dress?

172
00:21:52,834 --> 00:21:55,566
I was wearing a pink and black
dress.

173
00:21:56,363 --> 00:22:00,081
So you don't know
who she is...

174
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:04,882
the woman in the lavender dress?

175
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,795
Oh, go suck your head!

176
00:22:18,461 --> 00:22:19,460
Yeah?

177
00:22:19,561 --> 00:22:22,572
Mr. Partanna please.
It's Irene Walker calling.

178
00:22:22,846 --> 00:22:23,847
What?

179
00:22:24,056 --> 00:22:26,501
- Is this Charley Partanna?
- Yeah, yeah.

180
00:22:26,685 --> 00:22:29,815
I hope you don't mind
my calling so late.

181
00:22:30,026 --> 00:22:33,607
I wanted to apologise for running
out the way I did this afternoon.

182
00:22:33,951 --> 00:22:37,238
This is you?
Irene walker?

183
00:22:38,627 --> 00:22:42,397
I recognise the voice,
but I didn't get your name before.

184
00:22:43,502 --> 00:22:46,325
I just wanted to explain.
I hope you don't think I'm rude.

185
00:22:46,571 --> 00:22:50,892
Rude? Oh, no, no.
You could never be rude.

186
00:22:51,942 --> 00:22:54,514
So listen um.
Well...

187
00:22:55,369 --> 00:22:58,783
Why don't we get together later,
for like a late dinner?

188
00:22:59,676 --> 00:23:00,860
When you mean tonight?

189
00:23:01,006 --> 00:23:03,000
I could pick you up in half an hour.

190
00:23:03,135 --> 00:23:04,962
I live in California.

191
00:23:05,352 --> 00:23:06,882
California?

192
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:09,722
Yeah, that's where I live.
I had to come home.

193
00:23:14,784 --> 00:23:16,616
How about lunch tomorrow?

194
00:23:17,581 --> 00:23:18,740
Alright.

195
00:23:19,167 --> 00:23:22,914
How about the bar
at the Bell Age hotel?

196
00:23:24,134 --> 00:23:27,787
That would be tremendous.
What time?

197
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:30,346
- About two?
- Great.

198
00:23:55,617 --> 00:23:58,737
I was scared I was never
gonna see you again.

199
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,370
Dos zumos de piña
con BacardÍ.

200
00:24:12,776 --> 00:24:14,017
What was that you said?

201
00:24:14,195 --> 00:24:17,065
I ordered us a drink
something I think you'll like.

202
00:24:18,393 --> 00:24:19,897
Say it again.

203
00:24:20,603 --> 00:24:22,910
Zumo de piña
con Bacardi.

204
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:26,083
What is it some Puerto Rican
or something?

205
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:30,467
Yes, I guess it could be.
Pineapple juice with rum.

206
00:24:31,037 --> 00:24:32,972
I had it in Cuba.

207
00:24:34,193 --> 00:24:36,353
What were you doing in Cuba?

208
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:38,955
I was on my honeymoon.

209
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:45,276
I didn't know you was married.

210
00:24:45,675 --> 00:24:47,916
My husband left me 4 years ago.

211
00:24:48,681 --> 00:24:51,445
I don't know where he's.
I don't wanna know.

212
00:24:51,937 --> 00:24:53,262
He left you!

213
00:24:54,637 --> 00:24:55,935
Crazy huh!

214
00:24:58,411 --> 00:25:00,528
I could find him for you.

215
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:03,032
Let him stay lost!

216
00:25:04,488 --> 00:25:09,839
Well you might wanna
get married again someday.

217
00:25:10,475 --> 00:25:12,077
Maybe...

218
00:25:12,813 --> 00:25:14,800
but until that happens...

219
00:25:15,321 --> 00:25:17,353
I don't wanna know about him.

220
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,472
What about you?
Are you married?

221
00:25:25,418 --> 00:25:28,119
Once I was almost married.

222
00:25:28,553 --> 00:25:30,881
Mae rose was her name.

223
00:25:31,851 --> 00:25:33,803
We grew up together.

224
00:25:36,903 --> 00:25:39,230
One night we had a big fight...

225
00:25:39,366 --> 00:25:41,694
because I was dancing too much
with another girl.

226
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,863
I suppose I did it on purpose...

227
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:46,717
because I wanted
to make her jealous.

228
00:25:48,097 --> 00:25:51,412
So she flew off to Mexico
with the guy.

229
00:25:51,627 --> 00:25:53,222
Shacks up in a hotel...

230
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:57,214
Father sends some goons down there
to clobber the guy.

231
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:03,936
Brings her back to the States and
don't let her back into his house.

232
00:26:04,124 --> 00:26:06,573
That was 4 years ago.

233
00:26:07,125 --> 00:26:08,321
That's it?

234
00:26:09,334 --> 00:26:11,709
Yeah, she can't even go
to Brooklyn any more.

235
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:13,925
Only unless it's a special occasion...

236
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,516
weddings, funerals,
stuff like that.

237
00:26:17,221 --> 00:26:19,103
We're still friends.

238
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,821
She's in decorating.

239
00:26:21,921 --> 00:26:24,863
She did my apartment,
real nice job she did too.

240
00:26:26,921 --> 00:26:29,039
That's some family you got.

241
00:26:29,802 --> 00:26:32,797
Anyway...
I like you coat.

242
00:26:34,812 --> 00:26:38,757
Do you?
A coat like this...

243
00:26:38,903 --> 00:26:42,274
stand out in New York,
you know.

244
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:45,405
My father always says
it's better...

245
00:26:45,542 --> 00:26:49,108
to stand out because
of how serious you are...

246
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:53,463
instead of clothes, cars
or diamond rings...

247
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:56,535
For men that is.

248
00:26:56,856 --> 00:26:59,016
What am I doing all
the talking here for?

249
00:26:59,193 --> 00:27:01,730
How come I met you
at a Prizzi's wedding...

250
00:27:01,866 --> 00:27:03,317
and you ain't no wop?

251
00:27:03,501 --> 00:27:06,785
The Bishop who married them
wasn't Italian.

252
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,578
No he's a Polak.

253
00:27:09,798 --> 00:27:11,165
So am I.

254
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,250
Walker is a Polak name?

255
00:27:14,469 --> 00:27:15,837
No, it was Walkervisks.

256
00:27:16,223 --> 00:27:17,246
I shortened it.

257
00:27:17,475 --> 00:27:20,196
My maiden name was
Irene Walkervisks.

258
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:23,659
Either way...

259
00:27:24,574 --> 00:27:27,736
you're sure one
beautiful woman to me.

260
00:27:28,123 --> 00:27:32,706
I guess I thought that Walker sounded
more like a tax consultant should.

261
00:27:33,699 --> 00:27:36,277
You're a tax
consultant?

262
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:39,082
What do you do
when you consult?

263
00:27:39,354 --> 00:27:41,347
I save people money.

264
00:27:41,483 --> 00:27:44,019
Show them the angles.
There are a lot of angles.

265
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,190
This L. A corporation...

266
00:27:46,326 --> 00:27:48,779
had a guy kidnapped
in the Middle East...

267
00:27:48,915 --> 00:27:52,659
so I told them they ran some money
that was tax deductible staff loss.

268
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:55,292
- Things like that.
- Terrific.

269
00:27:57,390 --> 00:27:59,263
Shall we...

270
00:28:00,479 --> 00:28:03,471
- ...go?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

271
00:28:03,572 --> 00:28:05,855
We'll take my car.

272
00:28:07,869 --> 00:28:10,907
- What kind of a car is this?
- An Excaliber.

273
00:28:11,324 --> 00:28:13,610
Japanese make them in England
for the Arabian market.

274
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:15,344
Great California car.

275
00:28:15,836 --> 00:28:20,843
It's a great anyplace car.
Jesus it must cost though huh?

276
00:28:20,979 --> 00:28:25,018
Well it wasn't free but
think what'll cost in two years.

277
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:28,142
- Like to eat outside?
- Yeah.

278
00:28:34,882 --> 00:28:38,086
Irene I gotta say it.

279
00:28:38,305 --> 00:28:40,174
I can't sleep.

280
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:44,345
I'm a grown man middle aged
maybe...

281
00:28:44,898 --> 00:28:46,186
but no...

282
00:28:47,077 --> 00:28:49,941
nobody in my life has ever
affected me anything...

283
00:28:50,041 --> 00:28:53,983
like the way that
you make me feel.

284
00:28:58,388 --> 00:28:59,755
I love you.

285
00:29:02,391 --> 00:29:05,726
That's it.
That's everything.

286
00:29:07,884 --> 00:29:09,357
I love you.

287
00:29:11,413 --> 00:29:14,159
I think I'm in love with you
too Charley.

288
00:29:14,421 --> 00:29:15,772
No it ain't in love.

289
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:17,858
In love is temporary.

290
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:20,579
Then you move on
to the next in love.

291
00:29:20,725 --> 00:29:24,095
Everybody is always falling
in and out of love.

292
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,850
I notice.
I remember everything...

293
00:29:27,004 --> 00:29:29,732
I read about it in magazines.

294
00:29:29,951 --> 00:29:33,646
When you're just in love
it's just...

295
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:36,328
Wait a minute.

296
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,384
A hormonal secretion...

297
00:29:40,538 --> 00:29:42,716
which changes the senses smells.

298
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:45,889
So as to affect someone
in a certain way.

299
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,567
That's what in love is.
Who needs it.

300
00:29:51,286 --> 00:29:56,091
Love.
I mean, I love you

301
00:29:56,714 --> 00:30:01,253
I think that's sounds
like I'm hedging, but...

302
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:05,555
I don't know how to say it
because I've never said it before.

303
00:30:06,108 --> 00:30:09,437
All my life I've had
to protect myself and...

304
00:30:10,116 --> 00:30:13,738
you can't protect yourself from
anything when you love somebody.

305
00:30:15,669 --> 00:30:17,621
I love you Charley.

306
00:30:20,846 --> 00:30:22,964
What's that they're playing?

307
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,097
That's "Noche de Ronda."

308
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:29,978
I'm never gonna
forget it.

309
00:30:31,032 --> 00:30:34,182
I'm never gonna forget
this dress.

310
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:38,913
I'm never gonna forget anything
about today.

311
00:30:39,717 --> 00:30:42,837
Wherever we go
whatever it is...

312
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:45,342
whenever they play this song...

313
00:30:47,102 --> 00:30:50,185
this is gonna be our song.

314
00:31:27,244 --> 00:31:28,445
Irene!

315
00:31:30,374 --> 00:31:35,039
Everything being equal...

316
00:31:35,929 --> 00:31:37,617
would you marry me?

317
00:31:38,292 --> 00:31:41,054
Everything being equal...

318
00:31:43,094 --> 00:31:45,296
I'd marry you tonight

319
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:48,665
Oh, yeah!

320
00:32:20,712 --> 00:32:22,055
Have a cigar!

321
00:32:24,427 --> 00:32:26,505
My favourites.
From Mexico.

322
00:32:30,356 --> 00:32:32,391
Smell delicious!

323
00:32:32,528 --> 00:32:35,899
Charley come in.
You know Cyril, don't you?

324
00:32:36,034 --> 00:32:37,736
Hello Charley nice to see ya'.

325
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:40,468
- Wanna cigar Charley?
- No, thanks.

326
00:32:41,113 --> 00:32:42,915
Sit down!

327
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:47,046
Now Cyril,
you tell him...

328
00:32:47,773 --> 00:32:51,931
what happened at the big casino
with those dirty bastards.

329
00:32:52,483 --> 00:32:55,939
I've been President of the Prizzi's
casinos in Vegas for 20 years...

330
00:32:56,116 --> 00:32:59,112
and I have never seen
a scam like this before.

331
00:33:02,938 --> 00:33:05,610
I've got 14 phony I.O.U.

332
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:09,357
They come to $722.085.

333
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:12,026
Now when the collectors go to
pick up the money...

334
00:33:12,354 --> 00:33:14,257
the player that signed the I.O. U
is dead...

335
00:33:14,419 --> 00:33:17,787
from some bad cold or something
before he signed the paper.

336
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:20,536
Or else he was someplace else and
he wasn't in Vegas to sign it.

337
00:33:20,763 --> 00:33:23,720
Every piece of paper is counter-signed,
that's house rules...

338
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,318
by Louis Paul,
the acting manager...

339
00:33:26,471 --> 00:33:28,282
and the man in the cage,
Marxie Heller.

340
00:33:28,405 --> 00:33:30,275
They had to be working together.

341
00:33:30,461 --> 00:33:31,842
I don't get it.

342
00:33:32,665 --> 00:33:36,078
Louis takes paper to the cage
all he gets back is chips.

343
00:33:36,255 --> 00:33:38,499
- That's house rules too.
- Yeah.

344
00:33:38,677 --> 00:33:40,838
Now the big boss tells me
there's a woman in it.

345
00:33:41,233 --> 00:33:43,092
He says that he twice saw Louis...

346
00:33:43,228 --> 00:33:45,929
bring two big racks of $1.000
plates to this woman.

347
00:33:46,174 --> 00:33:49,814
She went to cashiers window but
he didn't think anything of it.

348
00:33:50,952 --> 00:33:53,877
So where's Louis and Heller?

349
00:33:54,153 --> 00:33:55,784
Louis caught it.
A bullet in the head.

350
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:58,326
Heller is hauled up in L. A
He's got a wife out there.

351
00:33:58,512 --> 00:34:01,003
They found Louis laid out
in the front seat of his car...

352
00:34:01,139 --> 00:34:03,466
in the parking lot of Leone's bar
way out on the street.

353
00:34:05,648 --> 00:34:09,593
I knew Louis when he was a helper
on an ice truck 30 years ago.

354
00:34:10,157 --> 00:34:11,858
We taught him his trade.

355
00:34:11,994 --> 00:34:15,240
He wasn't smart enough to figure
a scam like this.

356
00:34:15,668 --> 00:34:18,521
So I guess the first thing to do...

357
00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,918
is to find Marxie Heller.

358
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,838
I remember him now.

359
00:34:23,057 --> 00:34:25,542
He always wore
a silver toupe on the job.

360
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:29,978
He had dark brown bags under his eyes
as if he had coffee grounds in 'em.

361
00:34:30,305 --> 00:34:31,564
That's him.

362
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:35,184
He was good with figures, steady.
But he got T.B.

363
00:34:35,501 --> 00:34:37,179
Charley...

364
00:34:37,947 --> 00:34:40,862
Louis Palo was thief
but he was ours.

365
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,944
Heller must have iced him
So you ice Heller.

366
00:34:52,525 --> 00:34:53,526
Ok.

367
00:36:03,188 --> 00:36:05,641
What do you want my friend?

368
00:36:06,454 --> 00:36:08,265
The Prizzis sent me.

369
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:13,022
Where is your wife Mr. Heller?

370
00:36:13,973 --> 00:36:15,995
She's at the supermarket.

371
00:36:17,103 --> 00:36:19,628
And just who are you?

372
00:36:20,234 --> 00:36:21,965
Charley Partanna.

373
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:26,279
Where's the money Marxie?

374
00:36:26,618 --> 00:36:29,409
Straight arrow Charley.

375
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:32,486
The old American hood.

376
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:35,900
I don't know what
you're talking about.

377
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:40,182
Get up onto your feet!
Come on!

378
00:36:41,317 --> 00:36:44,540
Put your hands up!

379
00:36:56,846 --> 00:36:58,902
I think you broke my wrist.

380
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,590
You won't need it.

381
00:37:00,774 --> 00:37:02,078
Come on!

382
00:38:12,833 --> 00:38:14,367
I'm home, dear!

383
00:38:16,423 --> 00:38:19,308
Marxie's not here, Mrs. Heller.

384
00:38:33,671 --> 00:38:35,272
Charley!

385
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:40,668
What are you doing here?

386
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:46,928
Why didn't you call first?
You always call first!

387
00:38:47,184 --> 00:38:48,786
Charley!

388
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,951
Marxie Heller's wife?

389
00:39:00,002 --> 00:39:02,487
You married to Marxie Heller?

390
00:39:07,433 --> 00:39:09,639
- Where's the money?
- Money?

391
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:11,515
No bullshit.

392
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:15,147
Your husband killed Louis Palo
for the money, where is it?

393
00:39:15,282 --> 00:39:19,229
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've knocked me for whoop here.

394
00:39:19,375 --> 00:39:20,909
- Where Is Marxie?
- Dead.

395
00:39:21,045 --> 00:39:23,049
In the trunk of his car.

396
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:25,075
Stop this cheap bullshit!

397
00:39:25,259 --> 00:39:27,438
Where's the money
that your husband and Louis Palo...

398
00:39:27,561 --> 00:39:29,771
scammed from the Prizzi's
in Las Vegas?

399
00:39:33,638 --> 00:39:34,988
Maybe I...

400
00:39:35,171 --> 00:39:37,150
I do know something about it.

401
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:41,525
He had a bag with him.
I'll show you.

402
00:39:47,693 --> 00:39:48,715
It could be in here.

403
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:50,719
It's the only place I know
it could be.

404
00:40:08,684 --> 00:40:10,039
You sure?

405
00:40:11,103 --> 00:40:12,293
I'm sure.

406
00:40:12,732 --> 00:40:16,817
I got $360.000 here.
Half.

407
00:40:17,277 --> 00:40:18,278
Half?

408
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,696
Don't keep telling me
what I just said.

409
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:22,955
Where is the rest of the money?

410
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,831
I didn't even know
the money was there.

411
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:27,753
How could I know
it was short?

412
00:40:28,541 --> 00:40:30,592
When Marxie came home
three nights ago...

413
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:33,021
after being away from
me for five years...

414
00:40:33,205 --> 00:40:35,814
he threw that bag in the closet.
That's all I know.

415
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,803
Did you ask him why he came back
to you after five years?

416
00:40:40,956 --> 00:40:43,240
Charley please try and understand.

417
00:40:44,836 --> 00:40:47,542
I was glad when Marxie
showed up because...

418
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,759
it gave me a chance to
ask him for the divorce.

419
00:40:52,311 --> 00:40:53,971
You wanna know what I remember?

420
00:40:54,107 --> 00:40:56,348
I remember you coming in that door
and saying...

421
00:40:56,448 --> 00:40:57,446
"I'm home dear".

422
00:40:57,547 --> 00:41:00,015
Is that the way you ask for a divorce
these days...

423
00:41:01,121 --> 00:41:02,697
Mrs. Heller?

424
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:05,244
Charley, I could see
how sick he was.

425
00:41:06,288 --> 00:41:10,646
I didn't need to ask him.
He only had a few weeks left.

426
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:16,015
Oh, Marxie.

427
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:21,902
In all the years I knew
Marxie Heller...

428
00:41:22,706 --> 00:41:25,827
he never yelled at me
or hit me...

429
00:41:26,113 --> 00:41:27,831
or stole my money.

430
00:41:29,469 --> 00:41:31,212
He was my friend.

431
00:41:33,049 --> 00:41:33,966
If it wasn't for him.

432
00:41:34,066 --> 00:41:37,468
I'd probably still be earning
my living on my back...

433
00:41:37,945 --> 00:41:40,774
with half of your pals
in Chicago.

434
00:41:41,704 --> 00:41:44,772
It was his idea to study
book keeping and...

435
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,301
he got me a job
on the main wire too.

436
00:41:48,517 --> 00:41:51,094
Then he talked them into
making me a courier.

437
00:41:51,472 --> 00:41:53,004
He told me to study tax laws...

438
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:55,360
while I was flying back and forth
to Switzerland.

439
00:41:57,694 --> 00:42:01,556
He was always there for me,
like nobody else in my life.

440
00:42:02,203 --> 00:42:03,392
And I loved him.

441
00:42:03,539 --> 00:42:06,023
Not like I love you,
But I loved him.

442
00:42:08,549 --> 00:42:12,000
And that's the Gods honest truth.
And If you don't believe me,

443
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,551
why don't you just kill me
and get over with?

444
00:42:23,287 --> 00:42:24,889
I can't.

445
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:32,628
I can't change the way
I feel about you.

446
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,632
I look at you...

447
00:42:36,238 --> 00:42:38,478
and I see what I wanna see.

448
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:42,894
That's what love is.

449
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:45,967
If you were anybody else
I'd blow you away.

450
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:49,580
But I can't.

451
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:55,879
I have to believe this.

452
00:43:02,078 --> 00:43:04,104
Well how'd it go out there?

453
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:05,788
Okay.

454
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:10,241
I brought back 360.000 dollars.

455
00:43:10,364 --> 00:43:12,083
How come only half?

456
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:16,287
I talked to Heller
he won't say nothing.

457
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:22,057
So I pay him off with a bing.
Then the wife comes home.

458
00:43:23,162 --> 00:43:24,111
We talk.

459
00:43:24,211 --> 00:43:25,402
No problem.

460
00:43:26,753 --> 00:43:29,033
She's brings me the money
which she thinks is there...

461
00:43:29,169 --> 00:43:32,081
cause he brought a satchel home
with him when he came.

462
00:43:32,217 --> 00:43:33,375
I count.

463
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:35,376
It's only half.

464
00:43:36,205 --> 00:43:37,801
You worked her over?

465
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,055
No, she was scared.

466
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:43,343
She knew I'd tapped her husband.
I think she was telling the truth.

467
00:43:44,614 --> 00:43:46,547
What happened to Louis split?

468
00:43:48,143 --> 00:43:49,950
I don't know Dominic.

469
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,495
Somebody has got
our 360.000 dollars.

470
00:43:56,828 --> 00:43:58,429
Find it.

471
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:03,320
Okay.

472
00:44:13,174 --> 00:44:16,499
When I close my eyes
and you're cooking, Charley...

473
00:44:17,328 --> 00:44:19,476
I think your mamma
is still with us.

474
00:44:19,722 --> 00:44:21,389
Thanks Poppa.

475
00:44:23,028 --> 00:44:24,217
Pop...

476
00:44:26,342 --> 00:44:30,625
do you think Dominic believes
that I copped that other 360?

477
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,387
What the hell Charley.
The money had to go someplace.

478
00:44:33,594 --> 00:44:35,558
Dominic hates your guts anyway.

479
00:44:35,737 --> 00:44:39,670
Yeah that's getting real bad.
He never lets up.

480
00:44:39,793 --> 00:44:42,782
He don't eat right.
He never eats like this.

481
00:44:42,917 --> 00:44:47,005
He's got heartburn from
that place he eats at all the time.

482
00:44:47,217 --> 00:44:50,756
They make garbage.
It's not like this.

483
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:55,933
Well the man can't hate me
cause he don't eat right Pop.

484
00:44:56,945 --> 00:44:58,206
Charley...

485
00:44:59,157 --> 00:45:02,994
believe me, I know how
that mind of Dominics' works.

486
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:05,019
His life turned out miserable.

487
00:45:05,756 --> 00:45:08,886
He has to blame someone.
Every time he sees you...

488
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:13,595
he's reminded of the shame Maerose
put on you, on him, and on the whole family.

489
00:45:13,814 --> 00:45:15,055
You forgot.

490
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:16,809
Not Dominic.

491
00:45:17,664 --> 00:45:21,652
He probably worked it all around
so the whole mess is all your fault.

492
00:45:22,358 --> 00:45:24,407
Get it out of your head,
out of your head.

493
00:45:26,378 --> 00:45:28,071
Great dinner Charley!

494
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:29,651
Now.

495
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:32,298
What's the occasion?

496
00:45:33,622 --> 00:45:36,414
I wanna show you a woman.

497
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:39,882
The one that I went to California
to see about.

498
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:44,701
Isn't she beautiful?

499
00:45:45,836 --> 00:45:47,155
I like her.

500
00:45:47,339 --> 00:45:50,251
Kind of darker and
more round woman myself.

501
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:52,589
See you got a picture of me
with her.

502
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:13,840
- Pop what are you doing?
- Jesus Charley!

503
00:46:13,975 --> 00:46:17,906
She was the one we brought in
to make the Turbino hit.

504
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:20,144
She was a speciality hitter.

505
00:46:32,852 --> 00:46:35,584
Charley let me give you a hand
with the dishes.

506
00:46:35,767 --> 00:46:40,603
No, it's ok.
I'll just stack.

507
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:43,859
The girl'll take care of that
in the morning.

508
00:46:43,995 --> 00:46:44,996
Thanks.

509
00:46:45,122 --> 00:46:46,293
Alright.

510
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:50,665
Then, I'll just head on home.

511
00:46:52,002 --> 00:46:53,671
Getting late by my clock.

512
00:46:55,593 --> 00:46:57,302
- Great dinner Charley.
- Thanks.

513
00:46:57,438 --> 00:46:59,922
- Goodnight Pop.
- Night son.

514
00:47:00,932 --> 00:47:02,559
Thanks a lot.

515
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:49,700
Maerose?
Charley.

516
00:47:49,836 --> 00:47:52,736
What is this?
It's 00:45 a.m.

517
00:47:52,889 --> 00:47:55,492
It's the second time
you've called me in four years.

518
00:47:55,848 --> 00:47:56,849
Mae.

519
00:47:59,021 --> 00:48:00,681
Mae, listen.

520
00:48:01,483 --> 00:48:03,143
I broke that vase.

521
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:05,281
What vase?

522
00:48:06,024 --> 00:48:10,228
That special vase
that matches the rug.

523
00:48:10,586 --> 00:48:13,850
The one you knocked your self out
trying to find.

524
00:48:14,301 --> 00:48:16,869
Charley what are you out
of your mind.

525
00:48:17,767 --> 00:48:20,512
- You alone?
- Course I'm alone.

526
00:48:23,026 --> 00:48:24,898
I gotta see ya'.

527
00:48:37,419 --> 00:48:39,299
What's with you?

528
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:42,055
We gotta talk.

529
00:48:43,066 --> 00:48:47,232
You wanna talk out here
or you wanna sit down and talk?

530
00:48:48,538 --> 00:48:49,539
Sure.

531
00:48:56,971 --> 00:48:59,841
Oh, this is a beautiful set up
you got here Mae.

532
00:48:59,977 --> 00:49:03,198
The colours are right.
That's what counts.

533
00:49:03,412 --> 00:49:07,526
Everybody sees shapes differently
but colours are forever.

534
00:49:07,832 --> 00:49:08,833
Yeah.

535
00:49:11,374 --> 00:49:13,356
Why'd you call, Charley?

536
00:49:16,426 --> 00:49:18,605
We wasted a lot of time Mae.

537
00:49:18,765 --> 00:49:20,906
Four years you call that
a lot of time?

538
00:49:21,059 --> 00:49:22,993
How come you didn't wait
till I was 50?

539
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:28,649
You could have been a fat wop
broad by the time you were 50.

540
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:42,418
You wanna do it Charley?
Is that what you want?

541
00:49:42,634 --> 00:49:46,992
Whoah take it easy!
What the hell Mae!

542
00:49:48,772 --> 00:49:51,657
Nobody took it slower than me
Charley.

543
00:49:52,081 --> 00:49:53,713
Four years.

544
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:56,539
Answer the question
do you wanna do it?

545
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:59,921
Well, yeah.

546
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:01,308
So...

547
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:04,514
let's do it.

548
00:50:08,699 --> 00:50:10,193
With all the lights on?

549
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:14,612
Yeah right here on the oriental.

550
00:50:15,287 --> 00:50:17,435
With all the lights on.

551
00:50:20,505 --> 00:50:22,376
Mamma Mia!

552
00:50:29,991 --> 00:50:31,392
Thanks.

553
00:50:39,636 --> 00:50:41,546
What's your problem Charley?

554
00:50:42,846 --> 00:50:45,637
It certainly isn't
your God damned face.

555
00:50:47,757 --> 00:50:50,407
How can I tell you
with all people?

556
00:50:51,532 --> 00:50:54,237
But I got nobody else I can talk to.

557
00:50:57,392 --> 00:50:59,206
It's about a woman.

558
00:51:02,557 --> 00:51:03,882
Go ahead.

559
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,095
Tell me anyway.

560
00:51:07,358 --> 00:51:10,897
How can I feel worse than
I used to feel before last night.

561
00:51:13,078 --> 00:51:16,857
We grew up together.
We're the same people.

562
00:51:18,906 --> 00:51:22,378
What the hell Charley,
the calendar takes care of everything.

563
00:51:28,082 --> 00:51:29,935
I met her in a church.

564
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:32,231
Just happened.

565
00:51:32,808 --> 00:51:35,362
I knew she was the woman for me.

566
00:51:38,854 --> 00:51:41,584
She'd organised a scam in Vegas.

567
00:51:42,905 --> 00:51:46,127
I go looking for the bad guy and
it turns out to be my woman.

568
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:47,752
Can you imagine this?

569
00:51:48,490 --> 00:51:49,892
Not only that.

570
00:51:50,485 --> 00:51:53,094
Pop tells me...

571
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:55,987
she's the piece man
for the Turbino contract.

572
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,649
But just the same.

573
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:00,204
I love her Mae.

574
00:52:01,091 --> 00:52:02,361
I love her.

575
00:52:03,513 --> 00:52:04,514
Well.

576
00:52:05,615 --> 00:52:09,613
Can I live with this?
I gotta do something about.

577
00:52:09,713 --> 00:52:11,351
I gotta straighten it out.

578
00:52:11,779 --> 00:52:13,318
Then do.

579
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,184
Do what? Do I ice her?
Do I marry her?

580
00:52:17,368 --> 00:52:19,034
Which one of these?

581
00:52:19,763 --> 00:52:21,574
Marry her Charley.

582
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:24,796
Just because she's a thief
and a hitter...

583
00:52:24,931 --> 00:52:27,843
doesn't mean she isn't a good
woman in all the other departments.

584
00:52:28,229 --> 00:52:32,310
If she was some kind of fashion model
it wouldn't last more than 30 days.

585
00:52:32,864 --> 00:52:35,693
But you and she is in the same
line of business.

586
00:52:37,102 --> 00:52:40,324
You're lucky you've found each other.
You know that Charley?

587
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:43,946
Yeah.
She's an American.

588
00:52:44,467 --> 00:52:47,550
She had a chance to make a buck
so she grabbed it.

589
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:50,298
Marry her Charley...

590
00:52:51,403 --> 00:52:54,354
and at least I'll be able
to get something out of it.

591
00:52:55,024 --> 00:52:57,820
I'll be able to go back
in the family.

592
00:53:00,702 --> 00:53:01,703
Yeah.

593
00:53:10,355 --> 00:53:11,349
Thanks.

594
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:13,518
Shall we have them play
"Noche de Ronda"?

595
00:53:14,656 --> 00:53:15,655
Yeah.

596
00:53:15,755 --> 00:53:16,900
Would you ask them?

597
00:53:24,091 --> 00:53:26,113
I've been all shook up.

598
00:53:26,388 --> 00:53:27,389
Why?

599
00:53:29,060 --> 00:53:30,512
I know everything.

600
00:53:31,649 --> 00:53:33,266
I know you made
the hit on Turbino...

601
00:53:33,402 --> 00:53:36,179
after the wedding reception
when we met.

602
00:53:36,743 --> 00:53:40,281
I know you've been scamming us
with Louis and your husband.

603
00:53:45,886 --> 00:53:48,301
I did the work on Turbino.

604
00:53:48,945 --> 00:53:52,054
I had nothing to do with
what Marxie and his partner did.

605
00:53:53,234 --> 00:53:55,562
Louis Paulo was so suspicious...

606
00:53:55,759 --> 00:53:59,073
that he checked the car for bombs
every time he started it.

607
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:01,236
But he would have let some
beautiful broad

608
00:54:01,336 --> 00:54:04,228
walk over get in
and sit on his face.

609
00:54:06,837 --> 00:54:09,722
No matter how you got it
in your head Charley, you're wrong.

610
00:54:10,029 --> 00:54:12,898
I had nothing to do with it.
Nothing.

611
00:54:16,013 --> 00:54:17,615
Charley.

612
00:54:18,898 --> 00:54:23,283
Did you mean it that first night
when you asked me if I'd marry you?

613
00:54:25,381 --> 00:54:26,791
Charley?

614
00:54:30,375 --> 00:54:31,977
Alright.

615
00:54:34,024 --> 00:54:38,022
The Prizzi's are gonna have
to believe me cause I believe you.

616
00:54:39,552 --> 00:54:43,726
So could we get married.

617
00:54:43,919 --> 00:54:46,707
What you say we have one of those
pineapple drinks?

618
00:54:46,842 --> 00:54:48,961
The honeymoon has already started.

619
00:54:49,096 --> 00:54:50,846
Kiss me Charley.

620
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,604
In public?

621
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:00,083
Pop?
Charley.

622
00:55:00,451 --> 00:55:01,528
I'm in L.A.

623
00:55:01,747 --> 00:55:05,147
And that ain't all.
I'm gonna get married.

624
00:55:05,964 --> 00:55:08,123
The same woman?
The contractor?

625
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:10,763
Yeah, she's Polish...

626
00:55:10,947 --> 00:55:13,310
but the family will get used
to that gradually.

627
00:55:13,556 --> 00:55:14,971
Yeah, when she walks in a room...

628
00:55:15,107 --> 00:55:17,760
the rest of the women of family
are gonna have to shut up.

629
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:19,728
But I know how you feel
about her Charley.

630
00:55:19,828 --> 00:55:22,670
I'd not try to stop nature.
Good luck, son.

631
00:55:22,885 --> 00:55:25,525
- Thanks Pop.
- Say. Listen.

632
00:55:25,795 --> 00:55:28,957
The Don wants you here for
a big meeting tomorrow night.

633
00:55:29,452 --> 00:55:33,104
Jesus, Pop what about
my honeymoon?

634
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,081
So you'll have it in Brooklyn.

635
00:55:37,401 --> 00:55:38,402
Shit!

636
00:56:25,307 --> 00:56:28,959
So what do you say
we go for some confetti...

637
00:56:29,174 --> 00:56:32,581
and maybe a couple of pictures?

638
00:56:32,703 --> 00:56:34,214
Whatever you say honey.

639
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:39,578
If only Marxie could see me now.

640
00:56:41,050 --> 00:56:42,217
What's so funny?

641
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,469
Me marrying a Sicilian.

642
00:56:45,961 --> 00:56:48,691
I can hear him.
He always used to say:

643
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:51,853
"The Jews are bad enough
in this business...

644
00:56:52,037 --> 00:56:55,290
but the Sicilians'd rather eat
their children than part with money.

645
00:56:55,443 --> 00:56:58,021
And they're very fond
of their children".

646
00:57:01,613 --> 00:57:06,031
Marxie Heller is so fucking smart,
how come he's so fucking dead?

647
00:57:06,307 --> 00:57:07,308
Next.

648
00:57:52,587 --> 00:57:55,335
The man at the end of the table...

649
00:57:55,471 --> 00:57:57,743
is Mr. Alvin Gomski.

650
00:57:57,927 --> 00:58:02,642
He's Treasurer of 18 Lodges Bank
in the United States...

651
00:58:02,777 --> 00:58:06,315
of which we own 25%.

652
00:58:06,827 --> 00:58:10,602
Now I asked Mr. Gomski
to come here today...

653
00:58:10,816 --> 00:58:14,625
so you can hear from his own mouth
what has been happening.

654
00:58:15,543 --> 00:58:17,691
The bank president
Mr. Robert Finlay...

655
00:58:17,923 --> 00:58:20,515
is stealing from the bank...

656
00:58:20,791 --> 00:58:22,881
mainly through crooked
foreign exchange deals.

657
00:58:23,225 --> 00:58:25,219
If he's allowed to continue...

658
00:58:25,354 --> 00:58:27,389
the bank will go under
in less than a year.

659
00:58:27,757 --> 00:58:30,058
Thank you Mr. Gomski.

660
00:58:30,426 --> 00:58:35,197
Harry go.
See Mr. Gomski to his car.

661
00:58:40,739 --> 00:58:44,851
Robert Finlay's real name
is...

662
00:58:45,035 --> 00:58:47,183
Rosario Filargi.

663
00:58:47,459 --> 00:58:52,314
Now anybody who changes his
name from Filargi to Finlay...

664
00:58:52,430 --> 00:58:54,485
is also stupid enough...

665
00:58:54,622 --> 00:58:58,907
to think that we wouldn't
protect our 25 percent.

666
00:58:59,428 --> 00:59:01,834
Tell them our plan Eduardo.

667
00:59:05,136 --> 00:59:08,180
We are gonna kidnap Filargi.

668
00:59:09,442 --> 00:59:12,195
He's covered with two and a half
million in kidnap insurance.

669
00:59:12,317 --> 00:59:14,818
That's the tag on him
and we make the snatch.

670
00:59:15,939 --> 00:59:17,719
We know the insurance company
is gonna pay cause...

671
00:59:17,842 --> 00:59:21,525
as Charley has already pointed out,
that money is tax deductible

672
00:59:22,804 --> 00:59:25,053
We're also gonna leave a trail...

673
00:59:25,606 --> 00:59:29,139
so that the Feds think Filargi
organised the whole thing.

674
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,437
Cheating the bank,
milking the insurance company.

675
00:59:35,028 --> 00:59:36,863
When the mierda hits the fan...

676
00:59:38,219 --> 00:59:40,338
we'll be able to buy another
good size chunk of the bank...

677
00:59:40,506 --> 00:59:42,374
for about 10 cents on the dollar.

678
00:59:42,510 --> 00:59:44,336
We get control and interest.

679
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:46,298
Eventually...

680
00:59:47,794 --> 00:59:51,935
we stand to make
sixty seventy million dollars.

681
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:55,160
Thank you, Eduardo, my son.

682
00:59:56,756 --> 01:00:01,036
Some men suffer most
when you take their lives.

683
01:00:01,214 --> 01:00:04,090
Life is what is sweetest to them.

684
01:00:04,243 --> 01:00:08,426
For Filargi money is sweetest.

685
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:14,924
We'll leave him with his life and
without money or anywhere to get it.

686
01:00:15,814 --> 01:00:18,729
Well done Don Corrado.
That's beautiful.

687
01:00:19,312 --> 01:00:21,737
I almost feel sorry for the guy.

688
01:00:22,411 --> 01:00:23,977
Beautiful is right.

689
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:27,537
I like most beautiful things, Charley.

690
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,869
This one is very simple.

691
01:00:30,021 --> 01:00:31,807
We rely on you.

692
01:00:35,762 --> 01:00:37,265
How do you want me to handle it?

693
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:40,491
Pick your own people.
We don't wanna know.

694
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:53,807
Dominic my son stay with me
a moment.

695
01:00:59,577 --> 01:01:02,983
Maerose has written to me, Dominic.

696
01:01:04,149 --> 01:01:08,130
The man she wronged
has married another woman.

697
01:01:08,783 --> 01:01:11,250
Now Maerose has suffered,
Dominic...

698
01:01:11,523 --> 01:01:16,026
as you have suffered during
the years of her disgrace.

699
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:22,071
Now honour is protected,
I beg you...

700
01:01:22,317 --> 01:01:24,245
on my knees...

701
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:27,565
show compassion.

702
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:32,168
Here.
Here read her letter.

703
01:01:34,102 --> 01:01:37,815
Look how the child loves you.

704
01:01:38,061 --> 01:01:41,068
She wants to take care of you.

705
01:01:45,180 --> 01:01:47,292
Send her to me Poppa.

706
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,533
She's my daughter again.

707
01:01:52,331 --> 01:01:54,849
What we gotta do is take care
of the bodyguard...

708
01:01:54,985 --> 01:01:58,106
and get Filargi down to
our van in the basement.

709
01:01:58,241 --> 01:02:00,026
- Ok?
- Ok.

710
01:02:00,162 --> 01:02:02,704
There's only three apartments
on the floor.

711
01:02:02,858 --> 01:02:05,796
This one is Filargi's.
We get the other two.

712
01:02:05,896 --> 01:02:07,206
How are you gonna do that?

713
01:02:08,197 --> 01:02:11,021
One of them is empty,
this one we rent it.

714
01:02:11,266 --> 01:02:13,595
The other one,
we send matinee theater tickets...

715
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:17,019
and heavy duty lunch invitation
to the dame that lives there.

716
01:02:17,154 --> 01:02:19,604
A limo picks her up
and brings her back.

717
01:02:19,704 --> 01:02:22,154
She thinks it's a prize
she's getting...

718
01:02:22,289 --> 01:02:25,828
for working at the public library
for sixty years.

719
01:02:25,964 --> 01:02:27,915
She'll go alright.

720
01:02:28,268 --> 01:02:32,319
Everyday Filargi's bodyguard
comes out first.

721
01:02:32,519 --> 01:02:34,314
He goes to the elevator,
pushes the button.

722
01:02:34,498 --> 01:02:36,585
When he gets there,
he puts it on hold.

723
01:02:36,777 --> 01:02:40,083
Then he goes back to the apartment
and knocks on the door.

724
01:02:40,206 --> 01:02:42,486
That's when Filargi comes out.

725
01:02:43,091 --> 01:02:46,190
You know guys, you need a woman
on this stand.

726
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:49,991
- A woman?
- Yeah.

727
01:02:50,137 --> 01:02:53,188
A woman comes out of
the south apartment holding a baby.

728
01:02:53,394 --> 01:02:56,682
After Filargi's bodyguard gets him
out of his apartment.

729
01:02:56,818 --> 01:02:59,142
She smiles at them,
she goes gogo gaga at the baby.

730
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,480
She tosses the little darling
at the bodyguard...

731
01:03:01,581 --> 01:03:02,983
who naturally tries to catch it.

732
01:03:03,083 --> 01:03:06,034
While he's doing that, she gets her
piece out and covers him.

733
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:09,729
You come out of the other apartment
and take Filargi down to the garage.

734
01:03:09,852 --> 01:03:13,413
She takes the bodyguard back into
Filargi's apartment and does the job.

735
01:03:13,852 --> 01:03:15,653
That's good.

736
01:03:16,106 --> 01:03:18,261
For Christ sake.

737
01:03:18,599 --> 01:03:20,354
Where we gonna get a baby?

738
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:23,385
Where we gonna find a broad
who would do something like this?

739
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:26,074
Where?
Here, me.

740
01:03:26,332 --> 01:03:27,536
We get a fake baby.

741
01:03:27,713 --> 01:03:29,999
Good thinking Irene.

742
01:03:30,176 --> 01:03:31,273
You guys work it out.

743
01:03:31,395 --> 01:03:34,717
I got a terrific dinner almost ready.
Just a couple of minutes.

744
01:03:36,367 --> 01:03:39,252
Pop, what's the matter with you?

745
01:03:39,405 --> 01:03:42,812
I didn't get married so
my wife could go on working.

746
01:03:42,996 --> 01:03:44,930
Charley, she's right
and you know it.

747
01:03:45,145 --> 01:03:48,674
Throwing the baby.
Well that's strictly a masterpiece.

748
01:03:48,889 --> 01:03:53,001
The Prizzi's ever found out
I used my own wife on this job...

749
01:03:53,124 --> 01:03:54,751
I couldn't hold my head up.

750
01:03:54,904 --> 01:03:59,814
I'd be the laughing stock of every
family in Brooklyn and New York.

751
01:03:59,998 --> 01:04:01,717
Who's gonna know Charley?

752
01:04:01,901 --> 01:04:05,891
And what's that compared to sixty,
seventy million dollars.

753
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,286
Gentlemen, dinner is served.

754
01:04:33,726 --> 01:04:37,162
- Maerose!
- Coming Poppa!

755
01:05:24,950 --> 01:05:28,781
Jees Mae, you look awful!

756
01:05:30,132 --> 01:05:33,262
My beautiful daughter
has turned into an old woman.

757
01:05:35,441 --> 01:05:37,713
Charley Partanna did this to you.

758
01:05:38,725 --> 01:05:41,856
He had a chance to become part
of the Prizzi family.

759
01:05:42,276 --> 01:05:44,310
He had no use for you.

760
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:48,904
Oh, he had a use for me Poppa.

761
01:05:50,633 --> 01:05:56,169
He came to my place in New York the night
before he married that woman in California.

762
01:05:56,894 --> 01:06:00,052
And he forced himself on me.

763
01:06:00,855 --> 01:06:03,224
And he did it to me.

764
01:06:04,473 --> 01:06:07,419
- He did it to you?
- Yeah, Poppa.

765
01:06:07,635 --> 01:06:11,378
Screwed me three times, maybe four.
I can't remember.

766
01:06:11,532 --> 01:06:14,236
You whore.
Shut your filthy mouth you here.

767
01:06:14,550 --> 01:06:17,117
How can you say such things
to your own father.

768
01:06:19,327 --> 01:06:21,997
He done that to you, Charley?

769
01:06:22,151 --> 01:06:24,602
- You sure?
- Am I sure, Poppa.

770
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:27,153
You should see the size of him.

771
01:06:27,306 --> 01:06:28,780
- You should.
- Shut up.

772
01:06:28,933 --> 01:06:31,204
How can you say such things
to your father?

773
01:06:31,542 --> 01:06:32,800
Where's your honour?

774
01:06:32,953 --> 01:06:37,710
Are you kidding Poppa?
I have no honour anymore.

775
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:15,181
Here Poppa.

776
01:07:52,070 --> 01:07:53,990
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

777
01:07:57,195 --> 01:07:58,453
Do you mind?

778
01:08:09,809 --> 01:08:11,010
Catch!

779
01:08:19,813 --> 01:08:21,716
I must have the wrong floor.

780
01:08:22,637 --> 01:08:24,324
Oh my God!

781
01:08:35,986 --> 01:08:37,367
No blood I think.

782
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:39,731
Ok, come on!
Lets move them!

783
01:08:49,366 --> 01:08:51,975
I had to hit her Charley,
she was looking straight at me.

784
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:55,105
You done right, really.

785
01:09:10,475 --> 01:09:12,015
I can't get over it.

786
01:09:14,102 --> 01:09:17,018
I mean what kind of creep
wouldn't catch a baby.

787
01:09:17,355 --> 01:09:20,443
If it was real,
it could have been crippled for life.

788
01:09:21,191 --> 01:09:24,690
He wasn't
the bodyguard of the baby.

789
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:30,736
When the Don gets what he wants
and when I ask him for some time...

790
01:09:30,889 --> 01:09:34,111
we're gonna go to the old country
have a real honeymoon.

791
01:09:34,273 --> 01:09:36,506
Maybe even a real baby.

792
01:09:36,629 --> 01:09:39,298
Oh, God Charley,
I love you.

793
01:09:59,525 --> 01:10:01,118
What do you want?

794
01:10:01,271 --> 01:10:02,873
Come on!

795
01:10:14,513 --> 01:10:16,617
- See you at dinner.
- Ok, dear.

796
01:10:51,571 --> 01:10:55,096
Recapping our top stories at this hour, there
are new developments in this mysterious...

797
01:10:55,204 --> 01:10:57,887
- Come on Charley.
- Shut up, I wanna hear this.

798
01:10:58,060 --> 01:11:00,309
Police have now identified
both victims.

799
01:11:00,482 --> 01:11:02,554
One of whom was
a police captains wife.

800
01:11:03,035 --> 01:11:04,036
Shit!

801
01:11:04,462 --> 01:11:05,980
The man found with her
was the bodyguard...

802
01:11:06,158 --> 01:11:08,204
of the bank President
Robert Finlay.

803
01:11:08,355 --> 01:11:10,070
Finlay's apartment is right
next door...

804
01:11:10,170 --> 01:11:12,682
to the one where
the two bodies were found.

805
01:11:12,811 --> 01:11:14,303
Bank officers
reported him missing...

806
01:11:14,425 --> 01:11:16,899
when he didn't show up
at a meeting on Monday morning.

807
01:11:17,051 --> 01:11:19,754
Police now speculate
he has been kidnapped.

808
01:11:19,949 --> 01:11:23,626
They also believe
that Victoria Calhain...

809
01:11:23,756 --> 01:11:26,286
stumbled accidentally into
the scene of the crime...

810
01:11:26,568 --> 01:11:27,569
and the kidnappers...

811
01:11:27,671 --> 01:11:31,066
Look at this.
First she gotta push the wrong button.

812
01:11:31,174 --> 01:11:35,241
Then the broad turns out to be
a cops wife.

813
01:11:36,365 --> 01:11:37,743
Call's still waiting Charley.

814
01:11:50,663 --> 01:11:51,579
Yeah?

815
01:11:51,679 --> 01:11:52,631
Hi, darling!

816
01:11:53,972 --> 01:11:56,045
Were you watching the TV just now?

817
01:11:56,145 --> 01:12:00,003
Yeah, a police captains wife.
I couldn't believe my luck.

818
01:12:00,191 --> 01:12:03,103
All hell is gonna break out
over this, Irene.

819
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:06,582
Cops don't like it much
when we hit one of their wives.

820
01:12:06,799 --> 01:12:08,377
But it was an accident.

821
01:12:32,364 --> 01:12:33,684
Mr. Ciglione?

822
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:43,810
Mr. Ciglione.

823
01:12:51,441 --> 01:12:54,903
Mrs. Prizzi would you like to
come to my office please?

824
01:12:55,093 --> 01:12:58,276
Mrs. Prizzi,
would you care for a drink?

825
01:12:58,537 --> 01:13:00,786
I'll have a Babycham.

826
01:13:01,391 --> 01:13:02,221
Babycham?

827
01:13:02,321 --> 01:13:04,787
You heard what the lady said.
A Babycham!

828
01:13:05,025 --> 01:13:06,026
Okay!

829
01:13:06,972 --> 01:13:08,832
Would you please sit down
Mrs. Prizzi?

830
01:13:09,091 --> 01:13:10,864
I think I got something for you.

831
01:13:11,334 --> 01:13:12,357
Capulla!

832
01:13:15,646 --> 01:13:16,792
Come on!

833
01:13:18,133 --> 01:13:19,408
Sit down over there.

834
01:13:30,007 --> 01:13:31,077
That the broad?

835
01:13:32,172 --> 01:13:33,195
Tell the lady.

836
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:37,872
I was using this camper as
a trick room in the parking lot.

837
01:13:38,054 --> 01:13:41,723
As I lifted up my head from the job.
I saw this woman in hot pants...

838
01:13:41,947 --> 01:13:45,494
running to the lights of the car where
Louis Paulo caught it in the head.

839
01:13:45,948 --> 01:13:48,587
She's in the car a couple minutes.

840
01:13:48,782 --> 01:13:51,524
Then she gets out
and goes to the trunk...

841
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:54,541
takes out a satchel
and then she fades.

842
01:13:55,184 --> 01:13:56,352
The same woman?

843
01:13:58,234 --> 01:14:00,159
Yeah it's the same one.

844
01:14:18,348 --> 01:14:21,031
Why don't you go on one
of those cruises, honey?

845
01:14:30,029 --> 01:14:34,333
You've reached the answering
machine for 5554375.

846
01:14:34,529 --> 01:14:36,329
Nobody can take your call
right now.

847
01:14:36,429 --> 01:14:38,011
Please leave a message
after the beep.

848
01:14:39,979 --> 01:14:45,127
Meet me on the promenade,
Brooklyn 7pm tomorrow.

849
01:14:45,321 --> 01:14:46,533
Full price.

850
01:14:46,944 --> 01:14:50,923
I'll be on a bench at the end
reading "Popular mechanics".

851
01:15:35,978 --> 01:15:37,881
Are you the contractor?

852
01:15:41,808 --> 01:15:43,094
How much?

853
01:15:44,089 --> 01:15:45,429
It depends.

854
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:48,545
Some hits are tricky.
Who is it?

855
01:15:48,934 --> 01:15:51,527
A Brooklyn fellow,
Charley Partanna.

856
01:15:51,704 --> 01:15:53,151
Charley Partanna?

857
01:16:08,920 --> 01:16:12,315
Amalia told me that
you wanna thank me...

858
01:16:12,445 --> 01:16:15,192
for bringing you home?

859
01:16:15,386 --> 01:16:20,210
Well,
you are blood of my blood!

860
01:16:20,686 --> 01:16:22,871
You're flesh of my flesh!

861
01:16:23,909 --> 01:16:26,699
And as long as I'm able...

862
01:16:26,894 --> 01:16:29,511
I'm gonna think about
your well being.

863
01:16:29,684 --> 01:16:31,314
Thank you, grandfather.

864
01:16:31,955 --> 01:16:34,659
You have drawn me back
from purgatory.

865
01:16:37,384 --> 01:16:40,325
I wish you had been a son.

866
01:16:40,510 --> 01:16:43,029
You are a true Prizzi.

867
01:16:43,505 --> 01:16:46,122
Hey, you like to have a cookie?

868
01:16:49,864 --> 01:16:53,065
It is I who must offer you a gift
grandfather.

869
01:16:53,628 --> 01:16:55,250
A gesture of my gratitude.

870
01:16:55,444 --> 01:16:58,733
I have always enjoyed gifts.

871
01:17:09,050 --> 01:17:13,440
Who's this handsome lady?

872
01:17:14,068 --> 01:17:18,004
That is Charley Partanna's wife,
grandfather.

873
01:17:24,385 --> 01:17:25,386
Well?

874
01:17:28,073 --> 01:17:31,782
My gift to you is not only
the pictures...

875
01:17:32,165 --> 01:17:34,116
but also what they mean.

876
01:17:35,087 --> 01:17:38,080
Louis Palo was killed
in the parking lot in Las Vegas.

877
01:17:38,271 --> 01:17:39,223
I know.

878
01:17:39,323 --> 01:17:41,342
I took these pictures there.

879
01:17:43,051 --> 01:17:46,144
There was a woman who had been
turning tricks in a camper...

880
01:17:46,274 --> 01:17:47,832
in the parking lot.

881
01:17:48,285 --> 01:17:50,752
She told me she saw this woman...

882
01:17:50,881 --> 01:17:52,361
get into a car with Palo.

883
01:17:52,871 --> 01:17:56,310
After a minute she got out,
went to the trunk...

884
01:17:56,589 --> 01:17:58,373
and took out a satchel.

885
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,215
This woman?

886
01:18:02,366 --> 01:18:04,334
Yes, grandfather.

887
01:18:07,125 --> 01:18:08,747
She killed Palo...

888
01:18:09,331 --> 01:18:13,224
and she stole 720.000
dollars from us.

889
01:18:13,958 --> 01:18:16,441
She gave back half to save herself.

890
01:18:19,389 --> 01:18:22,071
What do you want me to do?

891
01:18:23,737 --> 01:18:25,099
She dishonoured us!

892
01:18:25,230 --> 01:18:27,760
You're like me.

893
01:18:27,902 --> 01:18:30,230
We forgive nothing.

894
01:18:35,504 --> 01:18:39,916
What would that do
to Charley Partanna?

895
01:18:40,511 --> 01:18:43,593
She must pay
like anybody else.

896
01:18:43,851 --> 01:18:45,591
Oh. What you ask...

897
01:18:45,691 --> 01:18:50,125
that would cause Charley
great pain.

898
01:18:50,903 --> 01:18:53,694
What is that compared to
the honour of the Prizzi's?

899
01:18:54,061 --> 01:18:57,890
Charley is like my son.

900
01:18:58,365 --> 01:19:03,087
I pledged to be his second father
on the day that he was born.

901
01:19:04,011 --> 01:19:05,593
- Grandfather.
- Shut up.

902
01:19:08,553 --> 01:19:10,630
Have another cookie my dear.

903
01:19:21,184 --> 01:19:24,754
We're here to tell you what we're
telling all the families in this town.

904
01:19:25,017 --> 01:19:26,510
All contracts are off...

905
01:19:26,646 --> 01:19:29,098
until we get who ever killed
Captain Calhain's wife.

906
01:19:30,420 --> 01:19:31,979
How do you mean Davey?

907
01:19:32,302 --> 01:19:36,614
It means nothing is happening.
We're coming down hard on you.

908
01:19:37,208 --> 01:19:39,609
A police captains' wife
has been murdered.

909
01:19:40,781 --> 01:19:42,468
You got narcotics right?

910
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:44,090
Plus loan sharking.

911
01:19:44,328 --> 01:19:48,136
Plus horse books, football,
basketball and boxing.

912
01:19:48,416 --> 01:19:51,574
Not to mention what you take out of
restaurants in the trucking business.

913
01:19:51,985 --> 01:19:54,104
Plus a couple of millions
in TV sets...

914
01:19:54,256 --> 01:19:56,549
that fall of the back of a truck
every week.

915
01:19:56,982 --> 01:20:00,202
We're gonna put them all out of
business, as of now.

916
01:20:01,913 --> 01:20:03,832
It'll cost us hundreds of thousands...

917
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:05,979
but that the way it's gonna be.

918
01:20:06,684 --> 01:20:10,135
I've been doing business with
the Police commissioners squad.

919
01:20:10,235 --> 01:20:11,684
For over 40 years now.

920
01:20:12,295 --> 01:20:13,982
We always went under one rule:

921
01:20:14,112 --> 01:20:16,015
You take our money,
you leave us alone.

922
01:20:17,665 --> 01:20:21,244
The more pressure you put on us
the more money you cost yourselves.

923
01:20:22,591 --> 01:20:23,788
There ain't a cop on the squad...

924
01:20:23,888 --> 01:20:27,090
who's had to get by on straight
police pay for a long time.

925
01:20:27,685 --> 01:20:28,686
Yeah.

926
01:20:29,902 --> 01:20:33,817
Look Angelo, our people don't like
this any better than you do.

927
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:36,282
But this one's a
point of honour with us.

928
01:20:36,412 --> 01:20:38,099
Do you understand that Angelo?

929
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:07,191
You're a fine looking woman.

930
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:11,041
Charley Partanna is a lucky man.

931
01:21:12,685 --> 01:21:14,686
Thank you for coming.

932
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:19,607
What a surprise you gave us
with this sudden wedding.

933
01:21:19,844 --> 01:21:23,262
Well, we just sort of swept
each other away.

934
01:21:23,608 --> 01:21:27,220
I understand,
I was young once.

935
01:21:28,496 --> 01:21:29,664
This...

936
01:21:30,075 --> 01:21:34,349
marriage of yours
has troubled me.

937
01:21:36,072 --> 01:21:37,797
Why Don Corrado?

938
01:21:38,423 --> 01:21:41,272
The people at Prizzi's place
in Vegas...

939
01:21:41,372 --> 01:21:43,499
have looked at pictures of you.

940
01:21:43,600 --> 01:21:47,011
They've told us that
you killed Louis Palo.

941
01:21:51,878 --> 01:21:55,079
Now, under ordinary
circumstances...

942
01:21:55,316 --> 01:21:57,653
you would have to be punished...

943
01:21:57,934 --> 01:22:01,741
cause those who steal must pay.

944
01:22:03,168 --> 01:22:05,461
You're the wife of my God son.

945
01:22:06,543 --> 01:22:11,950
I've searched to find some way
to show you clemency.

946
01:22:13,272 --> 01:22:14,611
What can I do?

947
01:22:14,978 --> 01:22:19,174
Well you got the other half of
the 720.000 dollars?

948
01:22:19,493 --> 01:22:20,494
Yes.

949
01:22:21,315 --> 01:22:22,700
Was Charley in this with you?

950
01:22:22,808 --> 01:22:23,809
No.

951
01:22:24,798 --> 01:22:27,804
He believed me when I told him
the half was Marxie's split.

952
01:22:27,999 --> 01:22:31,286
He didn't know that I had anything
to do with it or that I killed Louis.

953
01:22:31,459 --> 01:22:32,460
Good.

954
01:22:34,481 --> 01:22:36,642
Now you have five days...

955
01:22:38,121 --> 01:22:43,096
to get the 360.000 together,
then you will give it back...

956
01:22:44,286 --> 01:22:46,882
together with
a 50 percent penalty...

957
01:22:47,011 --> 01:22:49,292
for what you have done to us.

958
01:22:50,277 --> 01:22:53,457
Will five days be enough time
for you?

959
01:22:53,937 --> 01:22:54,938
Five days?

960
01:22:56,025 --> 01:22:58,646
Yeah, I can get it together
in five days.

961
01:23:07,966 --> 01:23:09,041
Irene?

962
01:23:09,553 --> 01:23:10,631
Charley.

963
01:23:13,204 --> 01:23:14,913
How come you're in L. A?

964
01:23:15,065 --> 01:23:17,600
I had business to attend to,
didn't you see my note?

965
01:23:18,266 --> 01:23:20,385
Can you get out here this weekend?

966
01:23:21,380 --> 01:23:23,046
I don't think so.

967
01:23:27,134 --> 01:23:28,235
Tell me.

968
01:23:28,994 --> 01:23:30,530
Tell you what.

969
01:23:31,071 --> 01:23:32,672
Tell me I love you.

970
01:23:34,943 --> 01:23:36,053
I love you.

971
01:23:36,543 --> 01:23:39,744
Love you too, and it's real.

972
01:23:39,939 --> 01:23:43,269
May not be scientific, but it's real.

973
01:23:43,638 --> 01:23:44,936
Scientific?

974
01:23:46,251 --> 01:23:49,789
I read it in a magazine.
According to a doctor...

975
01:23:50,018 --> 01:23:51,770
everyone is trying to get...

976
01:23:51,878 --> 01:23:54,841
what they thought
they needed from their mothers...

977
01:23:54,977 --> 01:23:56,427
but they didn't get it.

978
01:23:58,172 --> 01:24:00,686
I don't even remember my mother.

979
01:24:01,135 --> 01:24:03,305
That's the amazing part.

980
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:06,456
There's something in you
that knows anyways.

981
01:24:06,565 --> 01:24:08,512
The magazine said so.

982
01:24:09,247 --> 01:24:11,301
That's what love is.

983
01:24:11,553 --> 01:24:15,130
When you find someone
who'll give you...

984
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:18,721
what you think you wanted
when you were a baby...

985
01:24:19,002 --> 01:24:20,278
but you didn't get it.

986
01:24:20,407 --> 01:24:22,203
A doctor wrote this.

987
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,253
Charley forget doctors.

988
01:24:26,373 --> 01:24:29,514
Better yet,
lets play doctor.

989
01:24:31,569 --> 01:24:32,996
On the phone?

990
01:24:36,976 --> 01:24:41,453
Doctor Partanna
I have this itch...

991
01:24:42,197 --> 01:24:43,198
Well?

992
01:25:36,003 --> 01:25:38,049
They're not kidding around
this time.

993
01:25:39,442 --> 01:25:41,055
It's gonna get worse.

994
01:25:42,276 --> 01:25:44,698
They're gonna keep leaning on us...

995
01:25:45,368 --> 01:25:47,401
until we give them whoever it was...

996
01:25:47,537 --> 01:25:48,851
that hit that Cops wife.

997
01:25:50,451 --> 01:25:52,268
All I know is that...

998
01:25:53,393 --> 01:25:54,735
the cops tell us...

999
01:25:54,929 --> 01:25:59,427
the guy who got snatched the day
they did the number on the cops wife...

1000
01:26:01,201 --> 01:26:05,897
was in big business
with the Prizzi family.

1001
01:26:09,810 --> 01:26:11,735
I wanna make this a short meet.

1002
01:26:12,319 --> 01:26:14,623
I wanna put it to a vote right now...

1003
01:26:16,147 --> 01:26:17,899
that Dominic Prizzi...

1004
01:26:19,456 --> 01:26:21,836
tells us what the hell
he's gonna do about it.

1005
01:26:23,004 --> 01:26:24,193
Alright?

1006
01:26:25,058 --> 01:26:26,437
Raise your hands.

1007
01:26:28,579 --> 01:26:30,510
Hold the hands.

1008
01:26:33,061 --> 01:26:35,456
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1009
01:26:37,020 --> 01:26:39,053
I am Dominic Prizzi.

1010
01:26:40,394 --> 01:26:44,785
When most of you people was walking
around with holes in your pants...

1011
01:26:45,131 --> 01:26:47,147
I was holding up gas stations.

1012
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:50,733
We was the biggest family
in the country.

1013
01:26:51,944 --> 01:26:56,331
And now most of you have figured out
how to push broads...

1014
01:26:56,941 --> 01:26:58,795
we're still the biggest.

1015
01:26:59,753 --> 01:27:02,824
We lose more when the cops
get in an uproar...

1016
01:27:02,997 --> 01:27:04,273
than any of you.

1017
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:06,811
Now we don't like it...

1018
01:27:08,058 --> 01:27:11,606
but you ain't gonna tell us
how to run our business.

1019
01:27:14,071 --> 01:27:17,554
We ain't taking any shit
from any outsiders...

1020
01:27:18,116 --> 01:27:19,847
about the family business...

1021
01:27:21,209 --> 01:27:29,341
especially from a scummy little pimp
like you, Señor Bocca.

1022
01:27:44,548 --> 01:27:47,467
I hope you like it!

1023
01:27:51,078 --> 01:27:52,444
Thank you.

1024
01:27:58,676 --> 01:28:02,868
Padrino, you never saw anything
like this here...

1025
01:28:03,927 --> 01:28:07,345
the broad pushes the wrong button
on the elevator.

1026
01:28:07,569 --> 01:28:10,308
The door drops just in the minute...

1027
01:28:10,459 --> 01:28:12,666
when the second man drops
the bodyguard.

1028
01:28:12,817 --> 01:28:14,740
The woman is standing there.

1029
01:28:15,153 --> 01:28:17,208
She makes all three of us.

1030
01:28:18,181 --> 01:28:20,984
She had to go.

1031
01:28:21,304 --> 01:28:24,302
I'm sure you didn't act
without thinking.

1032
01:28:25,167 --> 01:28:28,455
That's why I called you here today.

1033
01:28:28,585 --> 01:28:30,056
You're a thinker.

1034
01:28:34,468 --> 01:28:37,159
Dominic is a sick man...

1035
01:28:38,548 --> 01:28:41,542
and the return of
his daughter brought him no ease.

1036
01:28:41,736 --> 01:28:43,589
He has got older.

1037
01:28:43,747 --> 01:28:46,127
I'm gonna move Dominic out
to Vegas...

1038
01:28:46,321 --> 01:28:49,349
and make you boss.

1039
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:01,808
I'm speechless Padrino.

1040
01:29:08,881 --> 01:29:10,200
This...

1041
01:29:10,590 --> 01:29:12,397
is an honour...

1042
01:29:14,634 --> 01:29:16,581
beyond my dreams.

1043
01:29:19,414 --> 01:29:21,750
What could I do to show
my gratitude?

1044
01:29:22,226 --> 01:29:25,448
For the time being
this must be our secret.

1045
01:29:25,601 --> 01:29:27,893
You must not even tell your father.

1046
01:29:32,825 --> 01:29:35,356
I don't understand Padrino.

1047
01:29:35,939 --> 01:29:40,677
We'll announce everything once
the Filargi thing is settled.

1048
01:29:40,882 --> 01:29:46,925
Then Dominic will move out
and you'll move in.

1049
01:30:09,811 --> 01:30:13,207
God, I missed you.

1050
01:30:14,461 --> 01:30:16,234
So I gathered.

1051
01:30:18,419 --> 01:30:20,020
What's been happening?

1052
01:30:23,005 --> 01:30:24,130
Plenty.

1053
01:30:25,211 --> 01:30:27,841
Just had a meeting with the Don.

1054
01:30:29,451 --> 01:30:31,181
A private audience.

1055
01:30:31,917 --> 01:30:32,918
Here.

1056
01:30:35,226 --> 01:30:37,401
He wants me to take over.

1057
01:30:37,663 --> 01:30:39,963
He says that Dominic is sick.

1058
01:30:40,179 --> 01:30:42,036
They're gonna send him to Vegas.

1059
01:30:42,255 --> 01:30:43,633
I'm gonna be the boss.

1060
01:30:43,733 --> 01:30:45,565
Charley,
that's fantastic.

1061
01:30:45,868 --> 01:30:47,360
I don't know.

1062
01:30:47,987 --> 01:30:50,193
Sounds fishy to me.

1063
01:30:52,486 --> 01:30:54,195
Number one...

1064
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,543
should have been Dominic
told me...

1065
01:30:58,781 --> 01:31:00,100
instead of the Don.

1066
01:31:00,208 --> 01:31:03,063
Well maybe the Don hasn't broken
the news to Dominic yet?

1067
01:31:04,513 --> 01:31:06,632
Whether he has or he hasn't...

1068
01:31:07,043 --> 01:31:08,881
he would have told Pop.

1069
01:31:10,071 --> 01:31:14,571
He don't decide what Mass to go to
unless he talks to Pop.

1070
01:31:15,284 --> 01:31:20,319
Big deal like this they'd go over
every angle fifteen times.

1071
01:31:20,419 --> 01:31:21,491
They didn't?

1072
01:31:21,686 --> 01:31:22,613
No.

1073
01:31:22,713 --> 01:31:24,622
And worse than that.

1074
01:31:24,801 --> 01:31:28,694
The Don says for me not to tell Pop.

1075
01:31:29,625 --> 01:31:31,939
Wanna know what I think, Irene?

1076
01:31:32,177 --> 01:31:33,178
What?

1077
01:31:37,346 --> 01:31:39,704
I think they're setting me up.

1078
01:31:46,409 --> 01:31:48,118
I think you're right Charley.

1079
01:31:48,723 --> 01:31:50,519
I think they're after our scalps.

1080
01:31:50,930 --> 01:31:52,678
How do you know?

1081
01:31:53,763 --> 01:31:55,643
I gotta a couple of things to tell you.

1082
01:31:57,406 --> 01:31:59,668
I went out to L. A on orders
of the Don.

1083
01:31:59,992 --> 01:32:02,114
He told me to bring back the money
I took from Louis Palo...

1084
01:32:02,249 --> 01:32:03,994
plus 50 percent interest.

1085
01:32:04,556 --> 01:32:06,972
So you did ice Louis Palo.

1086
01:32:07,072 --> 01:32:09,899
You swore to me that you didn't.
You lied to me.

1087
01:32:10,028 --> 01:32:11,758
I lied to you because
you wanted me to.

1088
01:32:11,894 --> 01:32:14,138
I only told you what
you wanted to be true.

1089
01:32:14,246 --> 01:32:16,085
And I told the Don
it was all my doing.

1090
01:32:16,193 --> 01:32:18,810
Jesus Charley, I'm so sorry.

1091
01:32:22,985 --> 01:32:25,775
What's the other thing you got to tell
me?

1092
01:32:26,142 --> 01:32:28,375
Dominic has put out
a contract on you.

1093
01:32:30,620 --> 01:32:32,458
What are you fucking nuts?

1094
01:32:32,588 --> 01:32:34,924
No, Charley,
I'm the contractor.

1095
01:32:37,346 --> 01:32:40,569
Dominic hires my own wife
to clip me?

1096
01:32:41,023 --> 01:32:43,251
Charley he didn't know
I was your wife.

1097
01:32:43,402 --> 01:32:45,038
He just wanted the best.

1098
01:32:47,015 --> 01:32:48,016
Charley!

1099
01:32:48,346 --> 01:32:51,593
Honey,
let's go to Hong Kong tonight.

1100
01:32:52,249 --> 01:32:53,785
What are you talking about?

1101
01:32:53,915 --> 01:32:56,315
Let's beat it while we still can.

1102
01:32:56,488 --> 01:32:57,317
Beat it?

1103
01:32:57,417 --> 01:33:00,165
Yeah, scram, split,
let's make a run for it.

1104
01:33:00,295 --> 01:33:01,986
Look I know this guy in Hong Kong
who can give us...

1105
01:33:02,086 --> 01:33:04,550
new prints even new faces
in a few days.

1106
01:33:04,650 --> 01:33:07,563
We can get out of this crazy world,
we can start fresh.

1107
01:33:07,736 --> 01:33:09,899
We can be together all the time.

1108
01:33:10,349 --> 01:33:11,277
Hong Kong?

1109
01:33:11,377 --> 01:33:12,970
Hong Kong, Brazil, South Africa.

1110
01:33:13,100 --> 01:33:16,301
It doesn't matter.
What matters is us together.

1111
01:33:17,321 --> 01:33:21,384
Listen, I've been doing three four
hits a year for the last few years.

1112
01:33:21,492 --> 01:33:23,114
Most of them full pay.

1113
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:26,229
That many?

1114
01:33:26,878 --> 01:33:30,122
Well it's not many if you consider
the size of the population.

1115
01:33:30,707 --> 01:33:34,304
The thing is
I got almost a million.

1116
01:33:34,535 --> 01:33:37,059
In a safe deposit box on the coast.

1117
01:33:37,195 --> 01:33:39,113
You must have at least
that much put away.

1118
01:33:39,213 --> 01:33:40,939
We can take all the money
and make a run for it.

1119
01:33:41,039 --> 01:33:42,856
We can go where we want,
do what we want...

1120
01:33:42,956 --> 01:33:44,909
we can be together
all the time.

1121
01:33:45,044 --> 01:33:47,664
Please Charley let's just go
before they get us.

1122
01:33:47,800 --> 01:33:50,216
They're not gonna get us.

1123
01:33:50,649 --> 01:33:52,747
Piss on the Prizzi's.

1124
01:33:53,144 --> 01:33:55,411
These people can't win all the time.

1125
01:33:55,512 --> 01:33:58,631
There has to be a way to beat them.
Bastards.

1126
01:34:03,453 --> 01:34:05,249
Let's call Pop.

1127
01:34:07,022 --> 01:34:11,504
And the Don told you to keep
making you boss a secret from me?

1128
01:34:11,681 --> 01:34:12,682
Yeah.

1129
01:34:13,814 --> 01:34:17,902
And he told you he's letting you off
for giving him back the money?

1130
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:20,367
Plus fifty percent.

1131
01:34:21,147 --> 01:34:24,824
And Dominic gave you a fifty dollar
down payment to hit Charley?

1132
01:34:25,018 --> 01:34:27,332
Absolutely.
Brand new bills.

1133
01:34:38,797 --> 01:34:40,592
Oh, he's hot.

1134
01:34:41,115 --> 01:34:43,066
I ain't never seen him this hot.

1135
01:35:02,091 --> 01:35:05,696
It's just business, just business.

1136
01:35:06,542 --> 01:35:08,076
What are we gonna do?

1137
01:35:08,211 --> 01:35:11,040
We have to take away the only thing
the Don wants,

1138
01:35:11,176 --> 01:35:12,778
Filargi.

1139
01:35:13,879 --> 01:35:17,344
You have to snatch Filargi again
This time from the Prizzi's.

1140
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,849
How many people you got out there
holding him down?

1141
01:35:19,985 --> 01:35:20,898
Two.

1142
01:35:20,998 --> 01:35:22,921
My people,
they do whatever I tell them.

1143
01:35:23,115 --> 01:35:24,042
Good.

1144
01:35:24,142 --> 01:35:28,327
Filargi is worth seventy million,
maybe more to the Prizzi's.

1145
01:35:28,711 --> 01:35:30,339
Including the bank.

1146
01:35:31,313 --> 01:35:33,919
So what are you next to
seventy million dollars?

1147
01:35:34,124 --> 01:35:35,125
Nothing.

1148
01:35:35,617 --> 01:35:37,261
They'll take whatever deal
you offer them.

1149
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:38,752
Yeah, no choice right.

1150
01:35:38,898 --> 01:35:43,354
They know we can let Filargi
go and testify against them.

1151
01:35:43,574 --> 01:35:45,191
Or even worse...

1152
01:35:46,345 --> 01:35:47,304
you can try and go into...

1153
01:35:47,404 --> 01:35:49,648
the Governments
witness protection programme...

1154
01:35:49,748 --> 01:35:52,618
and testify against
the Don and Dominic.

1155
01:35:52,964 --> 01:35:56,482
To a jury the colds facts would be
you shot the Captains wife...

1156
01:35:56,583 --> 01:36:00,751
on orders from the Don and Dominic
after they hired you for 150 dollars.

1157
01:36:02,113 --> 01:36:05,149
You're very dangerous to the Prizzi's,
Irene.

1158
01:36:05,536 --> 01:36:06,537
Yeah.

1159
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:11,078
It could turn out to be a good thing
Irene zipped the police captains wife.

1160
01:36:11,548 --> 01:36:13,490
It could solve all our problems.

1161
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:15,827
We're here tonight to honour
my son.

1162
01:37:16,541 --> 01:37:18,421
He's gonna leave us...

1163
01:37:18,855 --> 01:37:22,719
to live in a 935.000 dollar
house...

1164
01:37:22,819 --> 01:37:28,026
next to his own golf course
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1165
01:37:29,951 --> 01:37:34,746
And I said to him,
from you, from my heart...

1166
01:37:35,640 --> 01:37:37,459
God speed you!

1167
01:37:39,381 --> 01:37:41,588
God bless you Dominic!

1168
01:37:46,367 --> 01:37:48,314
And I want to present you...

1169
01:37:48,553 --> 01:37:53,787
with these tokens of esteem
from your entire family.

1170
01:37:54,652 --> 01:37:57,485
Some going away presents.

1171
01:38:03,411 --> 01:38:06,700
A complete set of
Stealing silver golf clubs.

1172
01:38:09,403 --> 01:38:12,452
That bag is made out of the hide
of an elephant.

1173
01:38:12,624 --> 01:38:14,993
It's the only one
in the United States.

1174
01:38:15,755 --> 01:38:20,171
And one thousand of your favourite
Mexican cigars.

1175
01:38:21,711 --> 01:38:26,578
We're gonna have a song in celebration
of this grand occasion...

1176
01:38:26,729 --> 01:38:30,059
the great Tenor
Tomas Innovarata.

1177
01:39:20,434 --> 01:39:21,742
Get moving.

1178
01:39:26,058 --> 01:39:29,310
Holy shit boss.
Somebody done the job on Fingo.

1179
01:40:20,590 --> 01:40:22,814
The Bocca's.

1180
01:40:23,701 --> 01:40:29,757
This killing of the Police captain's
wife is costing us all too much.

1181
01:40:37,791 --> 01:40:39,772
I got something to read to you.

1182
01:40:41,466 --> 01:40:42,714
It's a letter.

1183
01:40:43,448 --> 01:40:45,698
A letter?
Who from?

1184
01:40:47,667 --> 01:40:48,748
Charley.

1185
01:40:51,604 --> 01:40:52,793
You all set?

1186
01:40:57,118 --> 01:40:58,351
Dear Eduardo...

1187
01:40:58,892 --> 01:41:01,575
You're probably hot right now
cause we took Filargi.

1188
01:41:02,418 --> 01:41:04,364
But when you hear
the reason why...

1189
01:41:04,538 --> 01:41:07,674
you and the Don are gonna understand
there was no other way we could go.

1190
01:41:08,993 --> 01:41:12,432
Dominic put out a contract on me.

1191
01:41:17,079 --> 01:41:18,352
He's a fucking liar!

1192
01:41:18,498 --> 01:41:21,127
You wanna hear the letter,
listen don't talk.

1193
01:41:21,235 --> 01:41:23,680
There's a 130 million dollars here
maybe more.

1194
01:41:23,801 --> 01:41:25,800
We've gotta renegotiate it
before we get it back.

1195
01:41:25,972 --> 01:41:29,000
Just shut up and listen.
Go on, sit down.

1196
01:41:29,729 --> 01:41:30,753
Go on.

1197
01:41:34,698 --> 01:41:36,939
Dominic will say
it's a lot of bullshit.

1198
01:41:39,923 --> 01:41:41,691
It so happens
he hired my own wife...

1199
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:45,028
and gave her a down payment
of 50,000 dollars.

1200
01:41:45,526 --> 01:41:48,986
And my wife is sitting right next
to me and she's laughing like hell.

1201
01:41:50,046 --> 01:41:53,441
I personally think the Don found
Dominic on a doorstep...

1202
01:41:53,594 --> 01:41:56,983
because he's too dumb
to be a Prizzi.

1203
01:42:04,884 --> 01:42:08,605
The first thing I gotta have
before you get Filargi back...

1204
01:42:09,184 --> 01:42:11,892
is that you deliver
Dominic to me...

1205
01:42:12,432 --> 01:42:14,963
where I tell you
and when I tell you.

1206
01:42:15,115 --> 01:42:18,402
This time no contract,
I'll kill him myself.

1207
01:42:18,597 --> 01:42:20,413
Listen to the letter will ya' Dominic?

1208
01:42:20,566 --> 01:42:21,750
Come on.

1209
01:42:28,936 --> 01:42:31,250
For the main money
this is what I want.

1210
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:36,144
23,014 dollars for expenses.

1211
01:42:37,115 --> 01:42:39,359
Then 50 dollars for my helper.

1212
01:42:40,789 --> 01:42:43,291
Of course the 150 dollars
that was promised my wife...

1213
01:42:43,391 --> 01:42:46,045
as second man in the Filargi scam.

1214
01:42:47,148 --> 01:42:49,160
Charley's wife was the second man?

1215
01:42:49,332 --> 01:42:52,188
She was the only way
we could take out the bodyguard.

1216
01:42:52,896 --> 01:42:56,622
Then I want all the insurance coverage
on Filargi's kidnap policy...

1217
01:42:56,730 --> 01:42:57,731
which is two million five.

1218
01:42:57,865 --> 01:43:01,294
- My God he's a real businessman.
- That's my boy.

1219
01:43:01,414 --> 01:43:04,625
We gotta make him an offer and
eventually we settle.

1220
01:43:05,122 --> 01:43:09,242
The way I see it, we get about
60 or 70 million dollars...

1221
01:43:09,347 --> 01:43:11,212
with about 5.9% sales costs...

1222
01:43:11,312 --> 01:43:14,033
if we give Charley everything he wants,
which we obviously won't.

1223
01:43:14,185 --> 01:43:17,436
And I am part of
the fucking sales cost.

1224
01:43:18,073 --> 01:43:19,224
Dominic...

1225
01:43:19,614 --> 01:43:22,209
take some blood pressure medicine,
will ya?

1226
01:43:22,534 --> 01:43:24,491
Charley is just making a point.

1227
01:43:24,848 --> 01:43:26,663
Everything is negotiable.

1228
01:43:28,176 --> 01:43:29,961
We go over to Poppa's...

1229
01:43:31,293 --> 01:43:32,765
we hash this thing out.

1230
01:43:34,322 --> 01:43:36,831
Come on!
Let's go!

1231
01:45:14,034 --> 01:45:16,413
- Somebody is dead?
- Yes,

1232
01:45:16,609 --> 01:45:18,707
Who?
Who's dead?

1233
01:45:19,788 --> 01:45:21,293
Poppa...

1234
01:45:22,924 --> 01:45:24,221
Dominic.

1235
01:45:29,378 --> 01:45:32,116
The Bocca's again.

1236
01:45:38,324 --> 01:45:40,527
Oh Dominic!

1237
01:45:43,428 --> 01:45:44,835
He got old!

1238
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:52,016
Maybe it was his daughter,
who knows.

1239
01:45:54,547 --> 01:45:57,271
I agreed to retire him...

1240
01:45:57,519 --> 01:46:00,538
and I gave his job to Charley.

1241
01:46:02,701 --> 01:46:05,708
I told him to keep this secret
a little while...

1242
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:07,740
until...

1243
01:46:08,324 --> 01:46:11,244
Dominic's banquet.

1244
01:46:12,564 --> 01:46:14,921
Now Charley is all mixed up...

1245
01:46:15,029 --> 01:46:16,922
and we gotta get him back.

1246
01:46:17,451 --> 01:46:20,956
Only Charley can hold everything
together here.

1247
01:46:38,563 --> 01:46:39,968
How you doing Pop?

1248
01:46:40,379 --> 01:46:42,275
Fine, everything alright?

1249
01:46:42,527 --> 01:46:45,418
Yeah, everything's quiet out here.

1250
01:46:45,528 --> 01:46:46,933
That's better huh.

1251
01:46:48,923 --> 01:46:50,783
Sorry to drag you out here...

1252
01:46:50,891 --> 01:46:53,703
but I didn't want anyone
taking a pot shot at me.

1253
01:46:54,460 --> 01:46:57,157
When I told the Don about Dominic
putting out contract on you...

1254
01:46:57,257 --> 01:46:58,267
it knocked him out.

1255
01:46:58,375 --> 01:46:59,673
He couldn't believe it.

1256
01:47:00,343 --> 01:47:03,432
He told me with tears in his eyes
that he gotta straighten all this out.

1257
01:47:06,811 --> 01:47:08,735
He wasn't setting me up?

1258
01:47:09,664 --> 01:47:10,683
He said...

1259
01:47:10,958 --> 01:47:14,496
and I've known him for fifty years,
so it's like looking through his heart.

1260
01:47:15,052 --> 01:47:17,885
He said:
"We need Charley".

1261
01:47:19,096 --> 01:47:20,935
Oh, he said that?

1262
01:47:22,211 --> 01:47:24,526
The Don and me
don't have much time left.

1263
01:47:24,677 --> 01:47:26,450
The family has to keep going.

1264
01:47:26,865 --> 01:47:28,817
You're the only one that can run it.

1265
01:47:31,620 --> 01:47:33,283
Then everything is ok.

1266
01:47:33,419 --> 01:47:35,730
We don't have to hang on to Filargi.

1267
01:47:36,075 --> 01:47:38,335
The Don gave me his guarantee.

1268
01:47:40,791 --> 01:47:43,342
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock,
you bring Filargi...

1269
01:47:43,442 --> 01:47:45,810
at 42nd Street library
and let him out.

1270
01:47:46,327 --> 01:47:49,724
I'll tip off the cops and the FBI.
They'll be in his hotel room.

1271
01:47:50,546 --> 01:47:52,782
Ok Pop, want the paper?

1272
01:47:52,918 --> 01:47:54,720
Na, read it from cover to cover.

1273
01:47:54,880 --> 01:47:57,142
Jupiter was 6 at Vermont.

1274
01:47:57,250 --> 01:47:58,251
Ok.

1275
01:47:58,938 --> 01:48:01,988
By the way,
the insurance company paid off.

1276
01:48:03,272 --> 01:48:04,890
Take care of yourself Charley.

1277
01:48:18,761 --> 01:48:20,420
How are we gonna take Filargi in?

1278
01:48:21,758 --> 01:48:25,261
Pop's sending someone up on
the Palace to meet us.

1279
01:48:26,494 --> 01:48:29,912
We'll transfer him into the van
and I'll drive him into the city.

1280
01:48:30,063 --> 01:48:31,777
You stick with the plumber.

1281
01:48:31,912 --> 01:48:34,281
He'll drop you off at the apartment.

1282
01:48:36,162 --> 01:48:37,828
Tell me about the money Charley.

1283
01:48:40,272 --> 01:48:42,172
My end is 2,5 million...

1284
01:48:42,308 --> 01:48:44,132
plus I'm boss of the Prizzi's...

1285
01:48:44,232 --> 01:48:47,726
with heavy points in everything
the family does.

1286
01:48:49,789 --> 01:48:53,942
This time next week
we'll have all the money.

1287
01:48:54,123 --> 01:48:56,689
You mean to tell me you're gonna
turn over a hole ball of wax...

1288
01:48:56,797 --> 01:48:59,751
to some Sicilians who are gonna pay
you what they owe you next week.

1289
01:49:01,447 --> 01:49:03,307
Honey I'm the boss.
They need me.

1290
01:49:03,476 --> 01:49:06,140
I gotta believe Pop.

1291
01:49:06,240 --> 01:49:08,521
They're not gonna screw us over now.

1292
01:49:09,169 --> 01:49:11,315
Well maybe Pop is in there
looking after your interests...

1293
01:49:11,418 --> 01:49:14,230
but that doesn't necessarily mean
he's looking after mine.

1294
01:49:14,916 --> 01:49:17,583
There is a real pressure to turn over
the second man.

1295
01:49:18,989 --> 01:49:20,308
You're my wife.

1296
01:49:20,438 --> 01:49:22,505
I'm your Polak wife.

1297
01:49:22,990 --> 01:49:25,802
Irene will you shape up, jees.

1298
01:49:26,538 --> 01:49:31,902
Ok, I'll shape up as soon as I get
my 900 dollars.

1299
01:49:33,787 --> 01:49:35,774
What 900 dollars?

1300
01:49:36,011 --> 01:49:38,600
The $720 from the Vegas scam...

1301
01:49:38,700 --> 01:49:41,332
plus the $180 that
Don made me pay as penalty.

1302
01:49:41,440 --> 01:49:44,799
That's 900 dollars.
I just want what's mine.

1303
01:49:46,415 --> 01:49:50,157
That's Prizzi money honey, not yours.
You stole.

1304
01:49:50,481 --> 01:49:52,731
The Prizzi's got theirs back
from the insurance company.

1305
01:49:52,861 --> 01:49:54,234
Now I just want it back.

1306
01:49:54,829 --> 01:49:57,825
That ain't gonna make no sense
to the Prizzi's, honey.

1307
01:49:58,354 --> 01:50:01,708
Remember the words of the late,
great Marxie Heller.

1308
01:50:02,053 --> 01:50:05,558
We'd rather eat our children
than part with money.

1309
01:50:06,269 --> 01:50:08,433
Remember those words, honey.

1310
01:50:09,277 --> 01:50:10,533
I am Charley, I am.

1311
01:50:11,419 --> 01:50:12,420
I am.

1312
01:50:22,255 --> 01:50:23,669
Mr Filargi...

1313
01:50:25,141 --> 01:50:27,641
you were born a poor kid
in Naples right?

1314
01:50:27,922 --> 01:50:29,211
Yeah that's right.

1315
01:50:30,317 --> 01:50:32,377
You remember the Camorra?

1316
01:50:34,563 --> 01:50:37,656
The Camorra was small,
we're very big.

1317
01:50:38,196 --> 01:50:40,576
There's no where's we can't go.

1318
01:50:41,339 --> 01:50:43,380
They could lock you
in a steel room...

1319
01:50:43,480 --> 01:50:45,681
in a submarine
at the bottom of the ocean.

1320
01:50:45,832 --> 01:50:47,540
And we'd still get to you.

1321
01:50:48,752 --> 01:50:50,893
The cops are gonna talk to you.

1322
01:50:51,823 --> 01:50:55,716
If you tell them anything about who
took you, or where they took you.

1323
01:50:55,824 --> 01:50:57,194
We're gonna kill you.

1324
01:50:57,771 --> 01:50:59,069
Capiche?

1325
01:50:59,627 --> 01:51:01,077
I understand.

1326
01:51:02,205 --> 01:51:03,206
Good.

1327
01:51:05,515 --> 01:51:08,133
You're free Mr. Filargi,
good luck.

1328
01:51:10,649 --> 01:51:11,650
Yeah.

1329
01:51:16,589 --> 01:51:18,937
I've forgotten the Prizzi's already.

1330
01:51:21,131 --> 01:51:23,466
I got a request to make...

1331
01:51:23,705 --> 01:51:25,499
or Irene has.

1332
01:51:26,993 --> 01:51:28,745
What kind of request Charley?

1333
01:51:29,502 --> 01:51:31,535
She wants her money back.

1334
01:51:32,378 --> 01:51:33,979
What money?

1335
01:51:34,411 --> 01:51:37,807
The 540 she gave you for the Don.

1336
01:51:37,915 --> 01:51:41,283
Plus the 360.000 I took the night
I zipped Marxie Heller.

1337
01:51:41,419 --> 01:51:42,420
That money.

1338
01:51:43,257 --> 01:51:44,636
She's willing to forget about...

1339
01:51:44,736 --> 01:51:48,276
2,5 million for Filargi's insurance...

1340
01:51:48,470 --> 01:51:52,948
and the rest of what Dominic
owed her for the contract on me.

1341
01:51:55,154 --> 01:51:57,880
But she wants her 900 back.

1342
01:52:05,710 --> 01:52:07,570
With all the respect Charley...

1343
01:52:08,197 --> 01:52:09,798
your wife must be cracked.

1344
01:52:10,879 --> 01:52:13,264
Try and see it from
her point of view.

1345
01:52:13,756 --> 01:52:16,762
I mean you agreed to all that stuff
in the letter we sent...

1346
01:52:16,892 --> 01:52:18,644
when we had Filargi.

1347
01:52:20,050 --> 01:52:22,256
You made a commitment, Pop.

1348
01:52:23,467 --> 01:52:26,580
And anyways,
it was Irene's move...

1349
01:52:26,680 --> 01:52:29,436
that got Filargi out
in the first place.

1350
01:52:29,934 --> 01:52:31,795
We're gonna get the bank.

1351
01:52:32,205 --> 01:52:35,082
So, 900 doesn't seem
like so much money

1352
01:52:35,212 --> 01:52:37,829
Irene figures
she got it coming to her.

1353
01:52:40,489 --> 01:52:44,988
I glad that she's so foolish
and grasping.

1354
01:52:45,595 --> 01:52:48,623
Makes it a little easier
what we gotta do.

1355
01:52:52,711 --> 01:53:00,021
The family has decided that we've got
to give the second man to the cops.

1356
01:53:03,698 --> 01:53:05,926
Give Irene to the cops?

1357
01:53:06,423 --> 01:53:08,601
The family decided that...

1358
01:53:08,701 --> 01:53:12,026
we got one week to give up
the second man...

1359
01:53:12,415 --> 01:53:14,318
or we'll be at war.

1360
01:53:14,989 --> 01:53:18,904
War will cost us everything we got.

1361
01:53:19,077 --> 01:53:21,845
And that could mean the end
of the family.

1362
01:53:23,424 --> 01:53:25,370
Well Padrino.

1363
01:53:25,566 --> 01:53:27,988
You should never have married a
woman who wasn't in the environment.

1364
01:53:28,096 --> 01:53:29,350
That wasn't smart.

1365
01:53:29,568 --> 01:53:31,492
Might have been alright
if she was straight.

1366
01:53:31,665 --> 01:53:32,941
But she wasn't.

1367
01:53:37,938 --> 01:53:39,856
She gotta go.

1368
01:53:41,031 --> 01:53:44,059
And you gotta do the job on her,
Charley.

1369
01:53:44,167 --> 01:53:47,520
You're the only one who can get
close enough to do it.

1370
01:53:48,406 --> 01:53:50,137
Zip Irene?

1371
01:53:51,369 --> 01:53:52,948
Clip Irene?

1372
01:53:53,273 --> 01:53:55,545
If they take her alive
they're gonna make her talk.

1373
01:53:55,653 --> 01:53:57,382
And if she talks...

1374
01:53:58,183 --> 01:54:00,237
she's gonna drag us all to jail...

1375
01:54:00,367 --> 01:54:02,076
maybe even to the chair.

1376
01:54:02,985 --> 01:54:06,143
Filargi will go free and
we'll never get the bank.

1377
01:54:06,272 --> 01:54:07,895
There's no choice here.

1378
01:54:12,221 --> 01:54:15,538
How is doing a number on Irene
gonna satisfy the cops...

1379
01:54:15,638 --> 01:54:17,715
about the broad that pushed
the wrong button?

1380
01:54:19,358 --> 01:54:22,262
Filargi will identify
your wife's body...

1381
01:54:22,386 --> 01:54:24,658
and there will be no-one
to question.

1382
01:54:25,458 --> 01:54:26,855
Everybody will get
what they want...

1383
01:54:26,991 --> 01:54:29,654
and we can all go back
to doing business.

1384
01:54:31,666 --> 01:54:33,569
But Padrino...

1385
01:54:34,586 --> 01:54:36,488
she's my wife.

1386
01:54:36,885 --> 01:54:38,522
I can't kill her.

1387
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:41,008
Now, Charley...

1388
01:54:42,199 --> 01:54:47,152
you swore an oath of blood,
my blood and yours.

1389
01:54:47,260 --> 01:54:52,754
That you would always put the family
before anything else in your life.

1390
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:55,949
I'm simply calling on you now...

1391
01:54:56,049 --> 01:54:59,351
to keep that sacred oath.

1392
01:55:01,298 --> 01:55:06,164
Irene is my family Padrino.
She's my wife.

1393
01:55:06,316 --> 01:55:10,015
She's a woman you've known
for only a few weeks.

1394
01:55:10,537 --> 01:55:12,091
She is your wife.

1395
01:55:12,480 --> 01:55:14,038
We are your life.

1396
01:55:14,211 --> 01:55:16,092
You're failing your oath...

1397
01:55:17,780 --> 01:55:21,522
when you covered up for her
in the Vegas scam.

1398
01:55:22,820 --> 01:55:27,383
A great sin
against your honour.

1399
01:55:28,782 --> 01:55:31,341
But this for this you must stone.

1400
01:55:31,705 --> 01:55:32,856
I need her.

1401
01:55:36,749 --> 01:55:38,241
Look at you's.

1402
01:55:40,967 --> 01:55:43,281
Pop, you've been alone
since Mamma died.

1403
01:55:45,812 --> 01:55:49,532
Padrino you've been alone
all my life.

1404
01:55:51,522 --> 01:55:55,177
Is that what you want for me,
to grow old like you?

1405
01:55:55,546 --> 01:56:00,498
With nothing but bodyguards and
money to keep me company?

1406
01:56:04,132 --> 01:56:06,598
Charley,
my beloved man.

1407
01:56:08,028 --> 01:56:10,447
You will be even more alone.

1408
01:56:11,535 --> 01:56:15,855
If you turn you back on us,
we are your blood.

1409
01:56:18,905 --> 01:56:22,041
Jees, I feel like I'm drowning
or something.

1410
01:56:23,880 --> 01:56:26,972
We covered up the Vegas scam
to protect her.

1411
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:29,244
That's what I thought
we did for our women.

1412
01:56:29,352 --> 01:56:31,341
How can that be a sin
against honour?

1413
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:35,531
She is a hitter and a thief.

1414
01:56:36,042 --> 01:56:38,286
You must give her to us.

1415
01:56:38,826 --> 01:56:40,415
What is your answer?

1416
01:57:14,688 --> 01:57:15,942
The family...

1417
01:57:16,613 --> 01:57:19,771
It's the only place I can be,
I know that.

1418
01:57:36,665 --> 01:57:40,361
It's business Charley, only business.

1419
01:58:02,164 --> 01:58:05,171
Irene?
Charley.

1420
01:58:06,231 --> 01:58:07,232
Hello.

1421
01:58:07,918 --> 01:58:09,496
Everything is ok.

1422
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:11,891
The Don's gonna give you
your money back.

1423
01:58:12,027 --> 01:58:14,580
All 900 dollars, I got it right here.

1424
01:58:14,731 --> 01:58:16,567
The Don's giving money back?

1425
01:58:16,745 --> 01:58:17,746
Since when?

1426
01:58:17,867 --> 01:58:21,003
Yeah you could have knocked me
over.

1427
01:58:21,547 --> 01:58:22,842
That ain't all.

1428
01:58:23,217 --> 01:58:26,973
He's gonna pay you every dime
for Filargi's stand...

1429
01:58:28,098 --> 01:58:29,886
and what Dominic set.

1430
01:58:30,565 --> 01:58:31,926
How about that?

1431
01:58:32,727 --> 01:58:33,894
Oh, Charley!

1432
01:58:35,473 --> 01:58:36,490
Well...

1433
01:58:37,724 --> 01:58:40,167
I'm glad
everything is settled.

1434
01:58:42,958 --> 01:58:44,125
I just...

1435
01:58:44,428 --> 01:58:49,620
wanted you to know that
everything is a hundred percent ok.

1436
01:58:53,621 --> 01:58:58,228
Oh Marxie,
I should have listened.

1437
01:59:42,266 --> 01:59:46,981
After you take this stone out
of my shoe...

1438
01:59:47,738 --> 01:59:49,468
you call your father...

1439
01:59:50,095 --> 01:59:52,751
and tell him where he can get her.

1440
01:59:53,064 --> 01:59:56,435
And then the wind will stop blowing.

1441
01:59:57,197 --> 02:00:00,456
Charley, you got 900,000 here.

1442
02:00:18,625 --> 02:00:22,445
What's the first flight out of L.A. To
Hong Kong in the morning?

1443
02:00:23,730 --> 02:00:27,320
Flight 009 at 10.45 am.

1444
02:00:27,558 --> 02:00:29,570
But we can get you to Hong Kong
tonight out of LA.

1445
02:00:29,700 --> 02:00:31,942
Oh no thank you I have to go
to the bank in the morning.

1446
02:00:32,042 --> 02:00:36,664
Reserve 009 then one seat, first class.
The name is Hilary Jackson.

1447
02:00:37,152 --> 02:00:38,812
Mrs. Hilary Jackson.

1448
02:01:25,542 --> 02:01:26,743

1449
02:01:37,768 --> 02:01:38,969
Irene?

1450
02:02:34,978 --> 02:02:36,179

1451
02:02:37,725 --> 02:02:38,926
Irene?

1452
02:02:39,693 --> 02:02:41,445
Look who's here.

1453
02:02:46,872 --> 02:02:50,161
Charley!
What a wonderful surprise!

1454
02:02:50,552 --> 02:02:52,873
Baby I got three whole days.

1455
02:02:53,009 --> 02:02:55,309
We can do anything you want.
You name it.

1456
02:02:58,186 --> 02:03:00,717
Baby we are gonna have a ball.

1457
02:03:34,026 --> 02:03:37,673
Jesus, what a beautiful song.

1458
02:03:39,737 --> 02:03:41,429
Why don't you go
and warm up the bed?

1459
02:03:41,566 --> 02:03:42,786
I'll be right there.

1460
02:03:45,156 --> 02:03:46,157
Yeah!

1461
02:05:47,485 --> 02:05:48,486
Mae?

1462
02:05:49,016 --> 02:05:50,017
Charley.

1463
02:05:50,357 --> 02:05:51,515
Charley, you know what?

1464
02:05:51,619 --> 02:05:55,353
My sister Theresa just got back
today from her honeymoon.

1465
02:05:56,546 --> 02:05:58,790
Where did they go?
Outer space?

1466
02:06:02,124 --> 02:06:03,811
What do you say...

1467
02:06:04,459 --> 02:06:06,255
we go to dinner tonight?

1468
02:06:06,428 --> 02:06:07,575
Dinner?

1469
02:06:11,165 --> 02:06:12,333
What do you mean?

1470
02:06:12,528 --> 02:06:13,782
What do I mean?

1471
02:06:13,955 --> 02:06:16,826
I mean let's go some place
and get something to eat.

1472
02:06:17,092 --> 02:06:18,973
You, me and Irene?

1473
02:06:19,168 --> 02:06:20,169
No.

1474
02:06:21,460 --> 02:06:22,953
Just you and me.

1475
02:06:23,818 --> 02:06:25,354
What about Irene?

1476
02:06:27,214 --> 02:06:30,480
She had to go away.
She won't be back.

1477
02:06:34,049 --> 02:06:35,018
How about it?

1478
02:06:35,118 --> 02:06:36,320
How about?

1479
02:06:37,077 --> 02:06:40,646
Holy cow, Charley.
Just tell me where you want to meet.
