1
00:00:20,116 --> 00:00:24,905
Angelo!
My oldest, dearest friend.

2
00:00:25,034 --> 00:00:27,191
Your son!

3
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:30,653
He lost his mother,
but he's got another father.

4
00:00:30,786 --> 00:00:32,907
I'm his father now, with you.

5
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:40,365
I'll be as one with you,
protecting his future.

6
00:00:42,205 --> 00:00:44,777
We're honoured,
Don Padrone.

7
00:01:27,926 --> 00:01:31,837
Raise the first finger
of your right hand.

8
00:02:08,271 --> 00:02:14,932
This drop of blood symbolizes
your birth into our family.

9
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:20,434
We're one,
until death.

10
00:02:21,065 --> 00:02:23,270
We'll protect you...

11
00:02:23,525 --> 00:02:26,558
so much you protect
Prizzi's honour.

12
00:02:27,401 --> 00:02:31,609
- Do you swear it?
- Yeah.

13
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:39,143
Now that you have sealed a truly
Christian marriage...

14
00:07:39,277 --> 00:07:42,026
give these wedding rings to each
other saying after me:

15
00:07:43,194 --> 00:07:47,603
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

16
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,071
take and wear this ring...

17
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:53,525
as a sign of my love...

18
00:07:53,613 --> 00:07:55,190
and fidelity.

19
00:07:55,781 --> 00:08:01,696
In the name of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit...

20
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:04,615
take and wear this ring...

21
00:08:04,742 --> 00:08:06,780
as a sign of my love...

22
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:08,651
and fidelity.

23
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,820
In the name of the Father and of
the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

24
00:09:16,344 --> 00:09:19,296
Hey, you know that girl up there...

25
00:09:20,054 --> 00:09:23,467
blonde, lavender gloves?

26
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:26,050
Look pal
I'd like to help you but.

27
00:09:26,222 --> 00:09:28,628
I gotta take shots of the notables,
the bishops...

28
00:09:28,723 --> 00:09:30,963
Mr. Partanna,
what can I do for you?

29
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,967
I want shots of that girl up there
in the lavender gloves.

30
00:09:34,099 --> 00:09:36,423
You got it,
my pleasure.

31
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:39,881
Take care of yourselves.

32
00:09:42,643 --> 00:09:44,468
Don't tell me that
was Charley Partanna.

33
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:47,683
- Himself.
- Holy shit.

34
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:09,980
Hey, give me a ride over
to the reception, will ya'?

35
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:13,435
There's over half a dozen veal
steaks on the Prizzi meat counter.

36
00:10:13,568 --> 00:10:16,353
You got it Charley, jump in.

37
00:10:54,704 --> 00:10:57,240
Ok, quiet down!
Quiet down!

38
00:10:58,205 --> 00:11:01,785
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother Eduardo and I...

39
00:11:02,164 --> 00:11:07,237
would like to introduce you to a man
who needs no introduction:

40
00:11:07,749 --> 00:11:10,037
Our father
your dear friend...

41
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:13,248
a legend to his people:

42
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:16,454
Don Corrado Prizzi.

43
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:34,413
My father welcomes all of you
to this great family occasion...

44
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:37,168
and he says that you should
all have a great time.

45
00:11:37,424 --> 00:11:38,833
He offers his toast of love...

46
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:41,248
to the happiness of the bride
and groom...

47
00:11:41,925 --> 00:11:44,710
and he wishes them
many children.

48
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,630
Thanks to you all.

49
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,937
Excuse me would you care
to dance?

50
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,060
Yes.

51
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:15,612
Some spread, huh?

52
00:13:16,076 --> 00:13:17,902
Haven't I seen you
before?

53
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:20,567
I'm sure I'd remember.

54
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,191
I mean...

55
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:25,285
maybe's you were at the marry
mountain with the bride...

56
00:13:27,787 --> 00:13:29,410
I could never miss you.

57
00:13:29,996 --> 00:13:31,276
And you are?

58
00:13:31,413 --> 00:13:34,163
Charley Partanna,
pleased to meet you.

59
00:13:34,622 --> 00:13:36,744
Miss, Miss!
Telephone lady!

60
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:39,203
- Telephone?
- I'll be right back.

61
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,126
Hello, Aunt Amalia!

62
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:06,664
Maerose!

63
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:10,004
Pop actually invited me
to my own sisters wedding.

64
00:14:10,132 --> 00:14:12,039
Imagine that.

65
00:14:12,174 --> 00:14:14,710
He must be getting soft in his old age.

66
00:14:14,842 --> 00:14:17,165
Cara, let me look at ya'.

67
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:21,960
So Aunt Amalia
what do you think?

68
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:23,468
Such a one.

69
00:14:23,594 --> 00:14:26,048
Always making
a show of yourself.

70
00:14:26,178 --> 00:14:29,794
Come on Aunt Amalia,
I got a reputation to live up to.

71
00:14:29,929 --> 00:14:31,837
I'm the family scandal.

72
00:14:31,972 --> 00:14:34,507
Everybody be disappointed
if I stopped.

73
00:14:35,014 --> 00:14:38,047
Have you paid your respects
to your father yet?

74
00:14:46,309 --> 00:14:48,880
- Do I have to?
- Sure you have to.

75
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,680
Come on, lets' go together.

76
00:14:57,812 --> 00:14:58,807
Hello Pappa!

77
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:01,974
Dominic! Dominic!

78
00:15:02,104 --> 00:15:03,930
She came to pay you her respects.

79
00:15:04,064 --> 00:15:05,260
Speak to her!

80
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:08,346
Then how come she ain't
dressed right...

81
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,181
If she's so respectful?

82
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,356
How come she show's up
at a family wedding...

83
00:15:13,441 --> 00:15:15,348
dressed like a Badonna Dialo?

84
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:20,271
Don't worry Aunt Amalia,
he'll get his one day.

85
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:23,765
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself.

86
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:08,110
Where's the lady
you took to the telephone?

87
00:16:09,081 --> 00:16:10,740
Where's the lady
you took to the telephone?

88
00:16:10,873 --> 00:16:12,864
How should I know mister?

89
00:16:13,165 --> 00:16:14,623
Who told you to go get her?

90
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,576
Some old guy, I don't know.

91
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:19,659
An old guy.

92
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,079
Ok.
Here.

93
00:16:21,793 --> 00:16:23,664
Watch out for them conolli's.

94
00:16:24,168 --> 00:16:25,163
Thanks mister.

95
00:16:28,586 --> 00:16:30,079
Hello Charley.

96
00:16:30,378 --> 00:16:32,453
- Hi Maerose.
- Hi.

97
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:36,126
- How are you Mae?
- Fine Charley, and you?

98
00:16:36,588 --> 00:16:38,461
Fine too.

99
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,000
So how's the decorating
business?

100
00:16:44,132 --> 00:16:46,751
Oh, it's just great Charley,
we're always busy.

101
00:16:46,966 --> 00:16:48,673
Everything is art deco now.

102
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,794
Art who?

103
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,210
You know art deco,
after art nouveau.

104
00:16:53,343 --> 00:16:55,499
It's a style it's not a person.

105
00:16:56,969 --> 00:16:59,636
Like all that art stuff.

106
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:08,304
God!
Damn!

107
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,963
What's the matter Mae?

108
00:17:14,224 --> 00:17:16,428
I should have known to stay away.

109
00:17:16,557 --> 00:17:17,967
What happened?

110
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:23,465
I went to say hello to my father,
and he called me a whore.

111
00:17:24,768 --> 00:17:27,601
Maerose, I'm sorry.

112
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:33,892
Listen Mae what you gotta do
is forget about your father.

113
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:35,472
Forget about the alignment.

114
00:17:35,563 --> 00:17:37,388
They never gonna take you back
anyway.

115
00:17:37,521 --> 00:17:39,808
So screw them.
They don't deserve you.

116
00:17:41,523 --> 00:17:45,600
Especially that fucking Dominic.

117
00:17:47,982 --> 00:17:50,519
Mae, you are still beautiful.

118
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:54,775
Why don't you find yourself someone
who has nothing to do with the family?

119
00:17:55,026 --> 00:17:58,274
Settle down,
couple of kids.

120
00:17:58,485 --> 00:18:00,856
A life.

121
00:18:01,778 --> 00:18:03,982
Practice your meatballs.

122
00:18:06,613 --> 00:18:09,148
Sure Charley.
Thanks a lot.

123
00:18:09,238 --> 00:18:11,941
You're a big help.

124
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,118
Are you the guy
who took the pictures?

125
00:18:33,203 --> 00:18:34,198
Yeah.

126
00:18:34,287 --> 00:18:36,954
- So when do I get to see them?
- They're in the lab, Mr. Partanna.

127
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,236
I'll make sure I get them to you
as soon as they're out.

128
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,526
About noon tomorrow.

129
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,318
- Ok, meanwhile give me her name.
- Her name?

130
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:48,743
- Yeah her name, for Christ's sake.
- Mr. Partanna I didn't get no name.

131
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:50,701
I thought you knew her.

132
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:52,207
Oh for Christ's sake's!

133
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,704
- Hello.
- Mae.

134
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,838
She ain't here.
You wanna leave a message?

135
00:19:18,507 --> 00:19:21,790
- Who is this?
- This is the girl.

136
00:19:22,092 --> 00:19:24,841
Ask her, this is very important.

137
00:19:25,551 --> 00:19:28,668
Ask her if she knows a woman
at the wedding...

138
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,294
who wore a lavender dress.

139
00:19:30,427 --> 00:19:33,425
- You got it?
- I got it.

140
00:19:33,844 --> 00:19:36,001
Make sure she calls me.
You hear?

141
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:40,341
Now what's your name?
I'm gonna send you ten bucks.

142
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:44,218
Ten bucks?
Miss Peaches.

143
00:19:44,764 --> 00:19:46,471
Ok, Peaches.

144
00:19:47,015 --> 00:19:49,420
You tell Miss Prizzi
she has to call me...

145
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:52,138
no matter how late, tonight.

146
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:55,181
- Ok.
- Peaches thank you.

147
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:56,303
Bye, bye.

148
00:20:15,356 --> 00:20:17,892
Hey Partanna!

149
00:20:19,399 --> 00:20:21,105
Gallagher!
Homicide!

150
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:24,474
What's up?

151
00:20:24,608 --> 00:20:26,931
Somebody tagged Sally
Turbino this afternoon.

152
00:20:27,609 --> 00:20:28,771
Yeah?

153
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:30,313
Who dunnit?

154
00:20:30,485 --> 00:20:32,808
Where were you between
two and five today?

155
00:20:33,777 --> 00:20:35,401
I was at the wedding.

156
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:38,522
Corrado Prizzi's
granddaughter's wedding.

157
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:43,396
They're all gonna turn out
to be at the wedding.

158
00:20:43,947 --> 00:20:46,436
Come on!
We're taking you in!

159
00:20:59,201 --> 00:21:00,742
You couldn't be cleaner?

160
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:03,481
- Who made the hit bob?
- We did.

161
00:21:03,702 --> 00:21:07,400
We did? How come we did?
I don't know nothing about it.

162
00:21:13,539 --> 00:21:16,157
Well that's the best way in it.

163
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:18,413
Who hit him?

164
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,159
I don't tell.
It was a specialist job.

165
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,285
How come?

166
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:26,031
Dominic told me to set it up so
he couldn't have nothing to do with it.

167
00:21:26,542 --> 00:21:28,498
We was all at the wedding.

168
00:21:40,795 --> 00:21:43,166
- Mae?
- Charley?

169
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,790
Did you have any luck?

170
00:21:46,046 --> 00:21:47,919
What kind of a message was that?

171
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:51,004
Who can remember
a girl in a lavender dress?

172
00:21:51,381 --> 00:21:54,630
I was wearing a pink and black
dress.

173
00:21:54,758 --> 00:21:58,883
So you don't know
who she is...

174
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:03,669
the woman in the lavender dress?

175
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:06,582
Oh, go suck your head!

176
00:22:17,221 --> 00:22:18,217
Yeah?

177
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:21,470
Mr. Partanna please.
It's Irene Walker calling.

178
00:22:21,598 --> 00:22:22,676
What?

179
00:22:22,806 --> 00:22:25,378
- Is this Charley Partanna?
- Yeah, yeah.

180
00:22:25,516 --> 00:22:28,218
I hope you don't mind
my calling so late.

181
00:22:28,766 --> 00:22:32,347
I wanted to apologise for running
out the way I did this afternoon.

182
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,968
This is you?
Irene walker?

183
00:22:37,353 --> 00:22:40,719
I recognise the voice,
but I didn't get your name before.

184
00:22:41,895 --> 00:22:43,554
I just wanted to explain.

185
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:45,429
I hope you don't think I'm rude.

186
00:22:45,563 --> 00:22:49,604
Rude? Oh, no, no.
You could never be rude.

187
00:22:50,814 --> 00:22:53,221
So listen um.
Well...

188
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:57,479
Why don't we get together later,
for like a late dinner?

189
00:22:58,525 --> 00:22:59,555
When you mean tonight?

190
00:22:59,691 --> 00:23:01,683
I could pick you up in half an hour.

191
00:23:01,817 --> 00:23:03,643
I live in California.

192
00:23:04,235 --> 00:23:05,562
California?

193
00:23:05,693 --> 00:23:08,396
Yeah, that's where I live.
I had to come home.

194
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:15,152
How about lunch tomorrow?

195
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:17,400
Alright.

196
00:23:17,822 --> 00:23:21,567
How about the bar
at the Bell Age hotel?

197
00:23:22,406 --> 00:23:25,986
That would be tremendous.
What time?

198
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,981
- About two?
- Great.

199
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:57,323
I was scared I was never
gonna see you again.

200
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:07,741
Dos zumos de piña
con BacardÍ.

201
00:24:11,336 --> 00:24:12,581
What was that you said?

202
00:24:12,754 --> 00:24:15,622
I ordered us a drink
something I think you'll like.

203
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:18,628
Say it again.

204
00:24:19,213 --> 00:24:21,454
Zumo de piña
con Bacardi.

205
00:24:21,881 --> 00:24:24,630
What is it some Puerto Rican
or something?

206
00:24:24,756 --> 00:24:29,000
Yes, I guess it could be.
Pineapple juice with rum.

207
00:24:29,424 --> 00:24:31,499
I had it in Cuba.

208
00:24:32,717 --> 00:24:34,873
What were you doing in Cuba?

209
00:24:35,301 --> 00:24:36,877
I was on my honeymoon.

210
00:24:40,219 --> 00:24:43,337
I didn't know you was married.

211
00:24:44,179 --> 00:24:46,253
My husband left me 4 years ago.

212
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:49,847
I don't know where he's.
I don't wanna know.

213
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:51,757
He left you!

214
00:24:53,014 --> 00:24:54,424
Crazy huh!

215
00:24:56,681 --> 00:24:59,005
I could find him for you.

216
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:01,514
Let him stay lost!

217
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:08,302
Well you might wanna
get married again someday.

218
00:25:08,935 --> 00:25:10,594
Maybe...

219
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:13,011
but until that happens...

220
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:15,807
I don't wanna know about him.

221
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:20,266
What about you?
Are you married?

222
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,976
Once I was almost married.

223
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:28,724
Mae rose was her name.

224
00:25:30,274 --> 00:25:32,229
We grew up together.

225
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:37,640
One night we had a big fight...

226
00:25:37,776 --> 00:25:40,100
because I was dancing too much
with another girl.

227
00:25:40,235 --> 00:25:42,689
I suppose I did it on purpose...

228
00:25:42,777 --> 00:25:44,354
because I wanted
to make her jealous.

229
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:49,692
So she flew off to Mexico
with the guy.

230
00:25:50,238 --> 00:25:51,612
Shacks up in a hotel...

231
00:25:51,738 --> 00:25:55,603
Father sends some goons down there
to clobber the guy.

232
00:25:58,365 --> 00:26:02,312
Brings her back to the States and
don't let her back into his house.

233
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:04,696
That was 4 years ago.

234
00:26:05,242 --> 00:26:06,356
That's it?

235
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,072
Yeah, she can't even go
to Brooklyn any more.

236
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,281
Only unless it's a special occasion...

237
00:26:12,411 --> 00:26:14,650
weddings, funerals,
stuff like that.

238
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:17,449
We're still friends.

239
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,365
She's in decorating.

240
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,902
She did my apartment,
real nice job she did too.

241
00:26:25,247 --> 00:26:27,369
That's some family you got.

242
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:31,121
Anyway...
I like you coat.

243
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:37,071
Do you?
A coat like this...

244
00:26:37,209 --> 00:26:40,576
stand out in New York,
you know.

245
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:43,709
My father always says
it's better...

246
00:26:43,836 --> 00:26:47,533
to stand out because
of how serious you are...

247
00:26:48,087 --> 00:26:51,749
instead of clothes, cars
or diamond rings...

248
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,545
For men that is.

249
00:26:55,131 --> 00:26:57,287
What am I doing all
the talking here for?

250
00:26:57,464 --> 00:27:00,001
How come I met you
at a Prizzi's wedding...

251
00:27:00,132 --> 00:27:01,376
and you ain't no wop?

252
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:04,506
The Bishop who married them
wasn't Italian.

253
00:27:05,675 --> 00:27:07,582
No he's a Polak.

254
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,425
So am I.

255
00:27:10,385 --> 00:27:12,376
Walker is a Polak name?

256
00:27:12,593 --> 00:27:13,968
No, it was Walkervisks.

257
00:27:14,344 --> 00:27:15,374
I shortened it.

258
00:27:15,594 --> 00:27:18,000
My maiden name was
Irene Walkervisks.

259
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,763
Either way...

260
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:25,844
you're sure one
beautiful woman to me.

261
00:27:26,222 --> 00:27:30,797
I guess I thought that Walker sounded
more like a tax consultant should.

262
00:27:31,515 --> 00:27:33,174
You're a tax
consultant?

263
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:37,172
What do you do
when you consult?

264
00:27:37,434 --> 00:27:39,424
I save people money.

265
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:42,095
Show them the angles.
There are a lot of angles.

266
00:27:42,352 --> 00:27:44,259
This L. A corporation...

267
00:27:44,393 --> 00:27:46,847
had a guy kidnapped
in the Middle East...

268
00:27:46,978 --> 00:27:50,723
so I told them they ran some money
that was tax deductible staff loss.

269
00:27:50,812 --> 00:27:53,348
- Things like that.
- Terrific.

270
00:27:55,438 --> 00:27:56,979
Charley...

271
00:27:58,523 --> 00:28:01,521
- Shall we go?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

272
00:28:01,606 --> 00:28:03,894
We'll take my car.

273
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:08,934
- What kind of a car is this?
- An Excaliber.

274
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:11,638
Japanese make them in England
for the Arabian market.

275
00:28:11,734 --> 00:28:13,144
Great California car.

276
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:18,859
It's a great anyplace car.
Jesus it must cost though huh?

277
00:28:18,986 --> 00:28:23,028
Well it wasn't free but
think what'll cost in two years.

278
00:28:23,196 --> 00:28:26,396
- Like to eat outside?
- Yeah.

279
00:28:32,865 --> 00:28:36,066
Irene I gotta say it.

280
00:28:36,283 --> 00:28:38,155
I can't sleep.

281
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:41,943
I'm a grown man middle aged
maybe...

282
00:28:42,992 --> 00:28:44,154
but no...

283
00:28:45,077 --> 00:28:47,909
nobody in my life has ever
affected me anything...

284
00:28:47,994 --> 00:28:51,941
like the way that
you make me feel.

285
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:57,705
I love you.

286
00:29:00,206 --> 00:29:03,654
That's it.
That's everything.

287
00:29:05,916 --> 00:29:07,290
I love you.

288
00:29:09,333 --> 00:29:12,083
I think I'm in love with you
too Charley.

289
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,910
No it ain't in love.

290
00:29:14,042 --> 00:29:15,868
In love is temporary.

291
00:29:16,002 --> 00:29:18,491
Then you move on
to the next in love.

292
00:29:18,628 --> 00:29:21,994
Everybody is always falling
in and out of love.

293
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,623
I notice.
I remember everything...

294
00:29:24,754 --> 00:29:27,623
I read about it in magazines.

295
00:29:27,838 --> 00:29:31,536
When you're just in love
it's just...

296
00:29:32,631 --> 00:29:34,208
Wait a minute.

297
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:38,377
A hormonal secretion...

298
00:29:38,508 --> 00:29:40,582
which changes the senses smells.

299
00:29:40,716 --> 00:29:43,751
So as to affect someone
in a certain way.

300
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:48,420
That's what in love is.
Who needs it.

301
00:29:49,136 --> 00:29:54,471
Love.
I mean, I love you

302
00:29:54,554 --> 00:29:58,714
I think that's sounds
like I'm hedging, but...

303
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:03,379
I don't know how to say it
because I've never said it before.

304
00:30:03,931 --> 00:30:07,262
All my life I've had
to protect myself and...

305
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:11,548
you can't protect yourself from
anything when you love somebody.

306
00:30:13,475 --> 00:30:15,432
I love you Charley.

307
00:30:18,643 --> 00:30:20,765
What's that they're playing?

308
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,887
That's "Noche de Ronda."

309
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:27,760
I'm never gonna
forget it.

310
00:30:28,813 --> 00:30:31,729
I'm never gonna forget
this dress.

311
00:30:32,356 --> 00:30:36,682
I'm never gonna forget anything
about today.

312
00:30:37,482 --> 00:30:40,813
Wherever we go
whatever it is...

313
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:43,099
whenever they play this song...

314
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:47,936
this is gonna be our song.

315
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,158
Irene!

316
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:31,151
Everything being equal...

317
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:34,908
would you marry me?

318
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,706
Everything being equal...

319
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,954
I'd marry you tonight

320
00:31:44,792 --> 00:31:46,036
Oh, yeah!

321
00:32:18,301 --> 00:32:19,498
Have a cigar!

322
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:23,587
My favourites.
From Mexico.

323
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:29,966
Smell delicious!

324
00:32:30,096 --> 00:32:33,463
Charley come in.
You know Cyril, don't you?

325
00:32:33,597 --> 00:32:35,303
Hello Charley nice to see ya'.

326
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:38,344
- Wanna cigar Charley?
- No, thanks.

327
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:41,046
Sit down!

328
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:44,598
Now Cyril,
you tell him...

329
00:32:45,558 --> 00:32:49,470
what happened at the big casino
with those dirty bastards.

330
00:32:50,018 --> 00:32:53,467
I've been President of the Prizzi's
casinos in Vegas for 20 years...

331
00:32:53,644 --> 00:32:56,642
and I have never seen
a scam like this before.

332
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,021
I've got 14 phony I.O. U

333
00:33:03,271 --> 00:33:06,768
They come to $722,085.

334
00:33:07,064 --> 00:33:09,435
Now when the collectors go to
pick up the money...

335
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:11,266
the player that signed the I.O. U
is dead...

336
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:15,313
from some bad cold or something
before he signed the paper.

337
00:33:15,442 --> 00:33:17,930
Or else he was someplace else and
he wasn't in Vegas to sign it.

338
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:21,102
Every piece of paper is counter-signed,
that's house rules...

339
00:33:21,443 --> 00:33:23,564
by Louis Paul,
the acting manager...

340
00:33:23,694 --> 00:33:25,899
and the man in the cage,
Marxie Heller.

341
00:33:26,028 --> 00:33:27,651
They had to be working together.

342
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:29,313
I don't get it.

343
00:33:30,029 --> 00:33:33,442
Louis takes paper to the cage
all he gets back is chips.

344
00:33:33,613 --> 00:33:35,853
- That's house rules too.
- Yeah.

345
00:33:36,031 --> 00:33:38,187
Now the big boss tells me
there's a woman in it.

346
00:33:38,322 --> 00:33:40,444
He says that he twice saw Louis...

347
00:33:40,573 --> 00:33:43,572
bring two big racks of $1,000
plates to this woman.

348
00:33:43,699 --> 00:33:47,148
She went to cashiers window but
he didn't think anything of it.

349
00:33:48,283 --> 00:33:50,488
So where's Louis and Heller?

350
00:33:51,076 --> 00:33:53,115
Louis caught it.
A bullet in the head.

351
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:55,863
Heller is hauled up in L. A
He's got a wife out there.

352
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:58,318
They found Louis laid out
in the front seat of his car...

353
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,776
in the parking lot of Leone's bar
way out on the street.

354
00:34:02,955 --> 00:34:06,901
I knew Louis when he was a helper
on an ice truck 30 years ago.

355
00:34:07,456 --> 00:34:09,163
We taught him his trade.

356
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,537
He wasn't smart enough to figure
a scam like this.

357
00:34:12,957 --> 00:34:15,955
So I guess the first thing to do...

358
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:18,198
is to find Marxie Heller.

359
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,123
I remember him now.

360
00:34:20,334 --> 00:34:22,823
He always wore
a silver toupe on the job.

361
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:27,250
He had dark brown bags under his eyes
as if he had coffee grounds in 'em.

362
00:34:27,419 --> 00:34:28,450
That's him.

363
00:34:28,795 --> 00:34:32,624
He was good with figures, steady.
But he got T.B.

364
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:33,749
Charley...

365
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:37,205
Louis Palo was thief
but he was ours.

366
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:41,828
Heller must have iced him
So you ice Heller.

367
00:34:49,467 --> 00:34:50,842
Ok.

368
00:36:00,153 --> 00:36:02,606
What do you want my friend?

369
00:36:02,945 --> 00:36:04,853
The Prizzis sent me.

370
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:09,188
Where is your wife Mr. Heller?

371
00:36:10,822 --> 00:36:12,943
She's at the supermarket.

372
00:36:14,198 --> 00:36:16,568
And just who are you?

373
00:36:17,032 --> 00:36:18,905
Charley Partanna.

374
00:36:21,366 --> 00:36:23,358
Where's the money Marxie?

375
00:36:24,117 --> 00:36:26,192
Straight arrow Charley.

376
00:36:27,034 --> 00:36:29,405
The old American hood.

377
00:36:30,411 --> 00:36:32,816
I don't know what
you're talking about.

378
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:36,615
Get up onto your feet!
Come on!

379
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:39,243
Put your hands up!

380
00:36:54,167 --> 00:36:56,075
I think you broke my wrist.

381
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,786
You won't need it.

382
00:36:57,919 --> 00:36:58,948
Come on!

383
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:11,387
I'm home, dear!

384
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:15,937
Marxie's not here, Mrs. Heller.

385
00:38:30,527 --> 00:38:32,269
Charley!

386
00:38:34,944 --> 00:38:37,730
What are you doing here?

387
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:43,730
Why didn't you call first?
You always call first!

388
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,143
Charley!

389
00:38:50,407 --> 00:38:52,398
Marxie Heller's wife?

390
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:58,696
You married to Marxie Heller?

391
00:39:04,078 --> 00:39:06,613
- Where's the money?
- Money?

392
00:39:06,745 --> 00:39:08,155
No bullshit.

393
00:39:08,704 --> 00:39:11,785
Your husband killed Louis Palo
for the money, where is it?

394
00:39:11,913 --> 00:39:15,859
I don't know what you're talking about.
You've knocked me for whoop here.

395
00:39:15,997 --> 00:39:17,538
- Where Is Marxie?
- Dead.

396
00:39:17,664 --> 00:39:19,158
In the trunk of his car.

397
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:21,164
Stop this cheap bullshit!

398
00:39:21,248 --> 00:39:23,868
Where's the money
that your husband and Louis Palo...

399
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:26,073
scammed from the Prizzi's
in Las Vegas?

400
00:39:30,043 --> 00:39:31,240
Maybe I...

401
00:39:31,626 --> 00:39:33,748
I do know something about it.

402
00:39:34,711 --> 00:39:38,243
He had a bag with him.
I'll show you.

403
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,292
It could be in here.

404
00:39:45,422 --> 00:39:47,294
It's the only place I know
it could be.

405
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:06,583
You sure?

406
00:40:07,637 --> 00:40:08,833
I'm sure.

407
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:12,924
I got $360 here.
Half.

408
00:40:13,472 --> 00:40:14,466
Half?

409
00:40:15,138 --> 00:40:17,213
Don't keep telling me
what I just said.

410
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,338
Where is the rest of the money?

411
00:40:20,139 --> 00:40:22,344
I didn't even know
the money was there.

412
00:40:22,515 --> 00:40:24,257
How could I know
it was short?

413
00:40:24,932 --> 00:40:27,089
When Marxie came home
three nights ago...

414
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:29,844
after being away from
me for five years...

415
00:40:29,975 --> 00:40:31,599
he threw that bag in the closet.

416
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:32,721
That's all I know.

417
00:40:32,851 --> 00:40:35,933
Did you ask him why he came back
to you after five years?

418
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:39,890
Charley please try and understand.

419
00:40:40,895 --> 00:40:44,013
I was glad when Marxie
showed up because...

420
00:40:44,897 --> 00:40:48,227
it gave me a chance to
ask him for the divorce.

421
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:50,432
You wanna know what I remember?

422
00:40:50,564 --> 00:40:52,805
I remember you coming in that door
and saying...

423
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:53,894
"I'm home dear".

424
00:40:53,982 --> 00:40:56,471
Is that the way you ask for a divorce
these days...

425
00:40:57,566 --> 00:40:58,764
Mrs. Heller?

426
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,474
Charley, I could see
how sick he was.

427
00:41:02,526 --> 00:41:06,769
I didn't need to ask him.
He only had a few weeks left.

428
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:12,437
Oh, Marxie.

429
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:18,318
In all the years I knew
Marxie Heller...

430
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:22,231
he never yelled at me
or hit me...

431
00:41:22,364 --> 00:41:24,237
or stole my money.

432
00:41:25,866 --> 00:41:27,607
He was my friend.

433
00:41:29,116 --> 00:41:30,278
If it wasn't for him.

434
00:41:30,367 --> 00:41:34,196
I'd probably still be earning
my living on my back...

435
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:37,160
with half of your pals
in Chicago.

436
00:41:38,077 --> 00:41:41,159
It was his idea to study
book keeping and...

437
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:45,238
he got me a job
on the main wire too.

438
00:41:45,371 --> 00:41:47,695
Then he talked them into
making me a courier.

439
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,371
He told me to study tax laws...

440
00:41:49,455 --> 00:41:52,158
while I was flying back and forth
to Switzerland.

441
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:57,905
He was always there for me,
like nobody else in my life.

442
00:41:58,625 --> 00:41:59,738
And I loved him.

443
00:41:59,874 --> 00:42:02,364
Not like I love you,
But I loved him.

444
00:42:04,876 --> 00:42:08,325
And that's the Gods honest truth.
And If you don't believe me,

445
00:42:08,419 --> 00:42:10,872
why don't you just kill me
and get over with?

446
00:42:19,672 --> 00:42:21,414
I can't.

447
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:28,916
I can't change the way
I feel about you.

448
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:30,923
I look at you...

449
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:35,259
and I see what I wanna see.

450
00:42:35,426 --> 00:42:37,500
That's what love is.

451
00:42:39,177 --> 00:42:42,045
If you were anybody else
I'd blow you away.

452
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,844
But I can't.

453
00:42:50,264 --> 00:42:52,005
I have to believe this.

454
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,762
Well how'd it go out there?

455
00:43:01,017 --> 00:43:02,426
Okay.

456
00:43:02,558 --> 00:43:05,392
I brought back 360 dollars.

457
00:43:05,893 --> 00:43:08,464
How come only half?

458
00:43:08,726 --> 00:43:13,432
I talked to Heller
he won't say nothing.

459
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:17,308
So I pay him off with a bing.
Then the wife comes home.

460
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:20,057
We talk.

461
00:43:20,355 --> 00:43:21,469
No problem.

462
00:43:22,439 --> 00:43:25,224
She's brings me the money
which she thinks is there...

463
00:43:25,356 --> 00:43:28,272
cause he brought a satchel home
with him when he came.

464
00:43:28,399 --> 00:43:29,560
I count.

465
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,314
It's only half.

466
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,774
You worked her over?

467
00:43:34,567 --> 00:43:36,226
No, she was scared.

468
00:43:36,359 --> 00:43:38,185
She knew I'd tapped her husband.

469
00:43:38,318 --> 00:43:39,515
I think she was telling the truth.

470
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,401
What happened to Louis split?

471
00:43:44,362 --> 00:43:46,103
I don't know Dominic.

472
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:50,145
Somebody has got
our 360 dollars.

473
00:43:52,489 --> 00:43:54,065
Find it.

474
00:43:58,449 --> 00:44:00,274
Okay.

475
00:44:09,285 --> 00:44:13,066
When I close my eyes
and you're cooking, Charley...

476
00:44:13,202 --> 00:44:15,028
I think your mamma
is still with us.

477
00:44:15,912 --> 00:44:17,488
Thanks Poppa.

478
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:20,318
Pop...

479
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:26,455
do you think Dominic believes
that I copped that other 360?

480
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:29,372
What the hell Charley.
The money had to go someplace.

481
00:44:29,499 --> 00:44:31,574
Dominic hates your guts anyway.

482
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:35,916
Yeah that's getting real bad.
He never lets up.

483
00:44:36,042 --> 00:44:38,745
He don't eat right.
He never eats like this.

484
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:42,658
He's got heartburn from
that place he eats at all the time.

485
00:44:43,169 --> 00:44:46,701
They make garbage.
It's not like this.

486
00:44:47,504 --> 00:44:51,878
Well the man can't hate me
cause he don't eat right Pop.

487
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:54,207
Charley...

488
00:44:55,506 --> 00:44:59,452
believe me, I know how
that mind of Dominics' works.

489
00:44:59,590 --> 00:45:01,416
His life turned out miserable.

490
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:03,962
He has to blame someone.

491
00:45:04,091 --> 00:45:05,419
Every time he sees you...

492
00:45:05,550 --> 00:45:07,837
he's reminded of the shame Maerose
put on you...

493
00:45:08,009 --> 00:45:09,502
on him,
and on the whole family.

494
00:45:09,717 --> 00:45:10,796
You forgot.

495
00:45:10,926 --> 00:45:12,717
Not Dominic.

496
00:45:13,386 --> 00:45:17,546
He probably worked it all around
so the whole mess is all your fault.

497
00:45:18,054 --> 00:45:20,293
Get it out of your head,
out of your head.

498
00:45:21,471 --> 00:45:23,961
Great dinner Charley!

499
00:45:24,431 --> 00:45:26,089
Now.

500
00:45:26,264 --> 00:45:28,172
What's the occasion?

501
00:45:29,098 --> 00:45:31,717
I wanna show you a woman.

502
00:45:32,224 --> 00:45:35,590
The one that I went to California
to see about.

503
00:45:37,934 --> 00:45:40,091
Isn't she beautiful?

504
00:45:41,684 --> 00:45:43,344
I like her.

505
00:45:43,477 --> 00:45:46,096
Kind of darker and
more round woman myself.

506
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:48,427
See you got a picture of me
with her.

507
00:46:06,859 --> 00:46:09,643
- Pop what are you doing?
- Jesus Charley!

508
00:46:09,776 --> 00:46:13,557
She was the one we brought in
to make the Turbino hit.

509
00:46:13,943 --> 00:46:15,935
She was a speciality hitter.

510
00:46:29,322 --> 00:46:31,942
Charley let me give you a hand
with the dishes.

511
00:46:32,074 --> 00:46:36,364
No, it's ok.
I'll just stack.

512
00:46:37,242 --> 00:46:39,612
The girl'll take care of that
in the morning.

513
00:46:39,742 --> 00:46:40,737
Thanks.

514
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:41,863
Alright.

515
00:46:43,494 --> 00:46:46,408
Then, I'll just head on home.

516
00:46:47,578 --> 00:46:49,403
Getting late by my clock.

517
00:46:51,162 --> 00:46:53,034
- Great dinner Charley.
- Thanks.

518
00:46:53,163 --> 00:46:55,651
- Goodnight Pop.
- Night son.

519
00:46:56,455 --> 00:46:57,652
Thanks a lot.

520
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:45,333
Maerose?
Charley.

521
00:47:45,468 --> 00:47:48,585
What is this?
It's 00:45 a.m.

522
00:47:48,719 --> 00:47:51,125
It's the second time
you've called me in four years.

523
00:47:51,470 --> 00:47:52,962
Mae.

524
00:47:54,637 --> 00:47:56,296
Mae, listen.

525
00:47:57,097 --> 00:47:58,755
I broke that vase.

526
00:47:58,888 --> 00:48:01,093
What vase?

527
00:48:01,223 --> 00:48:05,715
That special vase
that matches the rug.

528
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:09,180
The one you knocked your self out
trying to find.

529
00:48:09,891 --> 00:48:12,463
Charley what are you out
of your mind.

530
00:48:13,351 --> 00:48:16,100
- You alone?
- Course I'm alone.

531
00:48:18,811 --> 00:48:20,967
I gotta see ya'.

532
00:48:33,190 --> 00:48:34,849
What's with you?

533
00:48:35,815 --> 00:48:37,605
We gotta talk.

534
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:42,773
You wanna talk out here
or you wanna sit down and talk?

535
00:48:44,068 --> 00:48:45,442
Sure.

536
00:48:52,486 --> 00:48:55,355
Oh, this is a beautiful set up
you got here Mae.

537
00:48:55,488 --> 00:48:58,402
The colours are right.
That's what counts.

538
00:48:58,988 --> 00:49:03,232
Everybody sees shapes differently
but colours are forever.

539
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:04,359
Yeah.

540
00:49:06,865 --> 00:49:08,691
Why'd you call, Charley?

541
00:49:11,908 --> 00:49:14,113
We wasted a lot of time Mae.

542
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:16,696
Four years you call that
a lot of time?

543
00:49:16,827 --> 00:49:19,280
How come you didn't wait
till I was 50?

544
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:24,116
You could have been a fat wop
broad by the time you were 50.

545
00:49:33,747 --> 00:49:37,659
You wanna do it Charley?
Is that what you want?

546
00:49:39,290 --> 00:49:42,622
Whoah take it easy!
What the hell Mae!

547
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,953
Nobody took it slower than me
Charley.

548
00:49:47,501 --> 00:49:49,124
Four years.

549
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:51,955
Answer the question
do you wanna do it?

550
00:49:53,503 --> 00:49:55,328
Well, yeah.

551
00:49:55,712 --> 00:49:57,039
So...

552
00:49:58,171 --> 00:49:59,912
let's do it.

553
00:50:04,089 --> 00:50:05,795
With all the lights on?

554
00:50:05,923 --> 00:50:10,166
Yeah right here on the oriental.

555
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:13,084
With all the lights on.

556
00:50:14,926 --> 00:50:17,296
Mamma Mia!

557
00:50:25,345 --> 00:50:26,838
Thanks.

558
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:36,880
What's your problem Charley?

559
00:50:38,348 --> 00:50:40,968
It certainly isn't
your God damned face.

560
00:50:43,058 --> 00:50:45,726
How can I tell you
with all people?

561
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:49,559
But I got nobody else I can talk to.

562
00:50:52,143 --> 00:50:54,514
It's about a woman.

563
00:50:57,853 --> 00:50:59,181
Go ahead.

564
00:51:00,021 --> 00:51:01,395
Tell me anyway.

565
00:51:02,647 --> 00:51:06,179
How can I feel worse than
I used to feel before last night.

566
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:12,138
We grew up together.
We're the same people.

567
00:51:13,983 --> 00:51:17,646
What the hell Charley,
the calendar takes care of everything.

568
00:51:22,569 --> 00:51:25,188
I met her in a church.

569
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:27,479
Just happened.

570
00:51:28,154 --> 00:51:30,607
I knew she was the woman for me.

571
00:51:34,281 --> 00:51:36,816
She'd organised a scam in Vegas.

572
00:51:37,823 --> 00:51:41,687
I go looking for the bad guy and
it turns out to be my woman.

573
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:42,979
Can you imagine this?

574
00:51:43,408 --> 00:51:45,114
Not only that.

575
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:47,777
Pop tells me...

576
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:51,192
she's the piece man
for the Turbino contract.

577
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:53,571
But just the same.

578
00:51:53,702 --> 00:51:55,409
I love her Mae.

579
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:57,281
I love her.

580
00:51:58,703 --> 00:52:00,031
Well.

581
00:52:01,120 --> 00:52:04,819
Can I live with this?
I gotta do something about.

582
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:06,531
I gotta straighten it out.

583
00:52:06,955 --> 00:52:08,117
Then do.

584
00:52:09,623 --> 00:52:10,618
Do what?

585
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:12,365
Do I ice her?
Do I marry her?

586
00:52:12,665 --> 00:52:14,207
Which one of these?

587
00:52:14,624 --> 00:52:16,034
Marry her Charley.

588
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:19,955
Just because she's a thief
and a hitter...

589
00:52:20,084 --> 00:52:22,999
doesn't mean she isn't a good
woman in all the other departments.

590
00:52:23,376 --> 00:52:27,453
If she was some kind of fashion model
it wouldn't last more than 30 days.

591
00:52:28,003 --> 00:52:30,836
But you and she is in the same
line of business.

592
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:36,042
You're lucky you've found each other.
You know that Charley?

593
00:52:36,172 --> 00:52:37,582
Yeah.

594
00:52:37,713 --> 00:52:39,456
She's an American.

595
00:52:39,631 --> 00:52:42,666
She had a chance to make a buck
so she grabbed it.

596
00:52:43,798 --> 00:52:45,173
Marry her Charley...

597
00:52:46,091 --> 00:52:49,457
and at least I'll be able
to get something out of it.

598
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:52,920
I'll be able to go back
in the family.

599
00:52:55,927 --> 00:52:56,922
Yeah.

600
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:06,425
Thanks.

601
00:53:06,513 --> 00:53:08,588
Shall we have them play
"Noche de Ronda"?

602
00:53:09,722 --> 00:53:10,717
Yeah.

603
00:53:10,806 --> 00:53:11,968
Would you ask them?

604
00:53:19,142 --> 00:53:21,298
I've been all shook up.

605
00:53:21,434 --> 00:53:22,429
Why?

606
00:53:24,102 --> 00:53:25,559
I know everything.

607
00:53:26,685 --> 00:53:28,309
I know you made
the hit on Turbino...

608
00:53:28,436 --> 00:53:31,470
after the wedding reception
when we met.

609
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:35,303
I know you've been scamming us
with Louis and your husband.

610
00:53:40,898 --> 00:53:43,351
I did the work on Turbino.

611
00:53:43,482 --> 00:53:47,061
I had nothing to do with
what Marxie and his partner did.

612
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:50,557
Louis Paulo was so suspicious...

613
00:53:50,692 --> 00:53:54,105
that he checked the car for bombs
every time he started it.

614
00:53:54,193 --> 00:53:56,231
But he would have let some
beautiful broad

615
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,523
walk over get in
and sit on his face.

616
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,319
No matter how you got it
in your head Charley, you're wrong.

617
00:54:05,196 --> 00:54:07,863
I had nothing to do with it.
Nothing.

618
00:54:11,323 --> 00:54:12,780
Charley.

619
00:54:14,198 --> 00:54:18,240
Did you mean it that first night
when you asked me if I'd marry you?

620
00:54:20,325 --> 00:54:21,735
Charley?

621
00:54:25,868 --> 00:54:27,527
Alright.

622
00:54:28,952 --> 00:54:32,947
The Prizzi's are gonna have
to believe me cause I believe you.

623
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:38,533
So could we get married.

624
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:41,615
What you say we have one of those
pineapple drinks?

625
00:54:41,747 --> 00:54:43,869
The honeymoon has already started.

626
00:54:43,998 --> 00:54:46,072
Kiss me Charley.

627
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:48,537
In public?

628
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:54,706
Pop?
Charley.

629
00:54:54,835 --> 00:54:56,410
I'm in L.A.

630
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:59,626
And that ain't all.
I'm gonna get married.

631
00:55:00,835 --> 00:55:02,910
The same woman?
The contractor?

632
00:55:03,337 --> 00:55:05,412
Yeah, she's Polish...

633
00:55:05,545 --> 00:55:07,702
but the family will get used
to that gradually.

634
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:09,837
Yeah, when she walks in a room...

635
00:55:09,964 --> 00:55:12,417
the rest of the women of family
are gonna have to shut up.

636
00:55:12,547 --> 00:55:14,586
But I know how you feel
about her Charley.

637
00:55:14,673 --> 00:55:16,996
I'd not try to stop nature.
Good luck, son.

638
00:55:17,132 --> 00:55:19,835
- Thanks Pop.
- Say. Listen.

639
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:23,797
The Don wants you here for
a big meeting tomorrow night.

640
00:55:24,092 --> 00:55:27,624
Jesus, Pop what about
my honeymoon?

641
00:55:28,843 --> 00:55:30,752
So you'll have it in Brooklyn.

642
00:55:31,428 --> 00:55:32,920
Shit!

643
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:23,850
So what do you say
we go for some confetti...

644
00:56:23,984 --> 00:56:26,899
and maybe a couple of pictures?

645
00:56:27,026 --> 00:56:28,934
Whatever you say honey.

646
00:56:29,984 --> 00:56:33,814
If only Marxie could see me now.

647
00:56:35,236 --> 00:56:36,315
What's so funny?

648
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:39,439
Me marrying a Sicilian.

649
00:56:40,821 --> 00:56:43,393
I can hear him.
He always used to say:

650
00:56:44,156 --> 00:56:46,691
"The Jews are bad enough
in this business...

651
00:56:46,823 --> 00:56:50,071
but the Sicilians'd rather eat
their children than part with money.

652
00:56:50,199 --> 00:56:52,569
And they're very fond
of their children".

653
00:56:55,826 --> 00:56:58,314
Marxie Heller is so fucking smart...

654
00:56:58,451 --> 00:57:00,489
how come he's so fucking dead?

655
00:57:00,702 --> 00:57:02,325
Next.

656
00:57:46,672 --> 00:57:49,920
The man at the end of the table...

657
00:57:50,048 --> 00:57:52,502
is Mr. Alvin Gomski.

658
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:57,208
He's Treasurer of 18 Lodges Bank
in the United States...

659
00:57:57,342 --> 00:58:00,874
of which we own 25º/º.

660
00:58:01,384 --> 00:58:05,461
Now I asked Mr. Gomski
to come here today...

661
00:58:05,594 --> 00:58:09,175
so you can hear from his own mouth
what has been happening.

662
00:58:09,762 --> 00:58:12,132
The bank president
Mr. Robert Finlay...

663
00:58:12,262 --> 00:58:14,633
is stealing from the bank...

664
00:58:15,014 --> 00:58:17,218
mainly through crooked
foreign exchange deals.

665
00:58:17,556 --> 00:58:19,547
If he's allowed to continue...

666
00:58:19,682 --> 00:58:21,719
the bank will go under
in less than a year.

667
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:24,090
Thank you Mr. Gomski.

668
00:58:24,224 --> 00:58:29,511
Harry go.
See Mr. Gomski to his car.

669
00:58:34,727 --> 00:58:38,722
Robert Finlay's real name
is...

670
00:58:38,895 --> 00:58:41,728
Rosario Filargi.

671
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:46,597
Now anybody who changes his
name from Filargi to Finlay...

672
00:58:46,731 --> 00:58:48,768
is also stupid enough...

673
00:58:48,897 --> 00:58:53,603
to think that we wouldn't
protect our 25 percent.

674
00:58:53,732 --> 00:58:56,103
Tell them our plan Eduardo.

675
00:58:59,275 --> 00:59:02,440
We are gonna kidnap Filargi.

676
00:59:03,693 --> 00:59:07,060
He's covered with two and a half
million in kidnap insurance.

677
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:09,066
That's the tag on him
and we make the snatch.

678
00:59:09,903 --> 00:59:12,190
We know the insurance company
is gonna pay cause...

679
00:59:12,321 --> 00:59:14,228
as Charley has already pointed out...

680
00:59:14,362 --> 00:59:16,484
that money is tax deductible

681
00:59:17,030 --> 00:59:19,484
We're also gonna leave a trail...

682
00:59:19,614 --> 00:59:23,360
so that the Feds think Filargi
organised the whole thing.

683
00:59:23,491 --> 00:59:26,655
Cheating the bank,
milking the insurance company.

684
00:59:28,992 --> 00:59:31,066
When the mierda hits the fan...

685
00:59:31,867 --> 00:59:34,535
we'll be able to buy another
good size chunk of the bank...

686
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:36,574
for about 10 cents on the dollar.

687
00:59:36,702 --> 00:59:38,528
We get control and interest.

688
00:59:39,078 --> 00:59:40,487
Eventually...

689
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:46,113
we stand to make
sixty seventy million dollars.

690
00:59:46,913 --> 00:59:49,782
Thank you, Eduardo, my son.

691
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:55,204
Some men suffer most
when you take their lives.

692
00:59:55,374 --> 00:59:58,373
Life is what is sweetest to them.

693
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:02,577
For Filargi money is sweetest.

694
01:00:03,376 --> 01:00:08,876
We'll leave him with his life and
without money or anywhere to get it.

695
01:00:09,711 --> 01:00:12,663
Well done Don Corrado.
That's beautiful.

696
01:00:13,545 --> 01:00:15,418
I almost feel sorry for the guy.

697
01:00:15,630 --> 01:00:17,667
Beautiful is right.

698
01:00:18,005 --> 01:00:21,419
I like most beautiful things, Charley.

699
01:00:21,548 --> 01:00:24,037
This one is very simple.

700
01:00:24,131 --> 01:00:25,922
We rely on you.

701
01:00:30,092 --> 01:00:31,668
How do you want me to handle it?

702
01:00:31,801 --> 01:00:34,585
Pick your own people.
We don't wanna know.

703
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:47,591
Dominic my son stay with me
a moment.

704
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:57,344
Maerose has written to me, Dominic.

705
01:00:57,766 --> 01:01:02,175
The man she wronged
has married another woman.

706
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:05,298
Now Maerose has suffered,
Dominic...

707
01:01:05,559 --> 01:01:09,555
as you have suffered during
the years of her disgrace.

708
01:01:11,478 --> 01:01:16,468
Now honour is protected,
I beg you...

709
01:01:16,687 --> 01:01:18,264
on my knees...

710
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:21,188
show compassion.

711
01:01:21,605 --> 01:01:25,647
Here.
Here read her letter.

712
01:01:28,316 --> 01:01:32,440
Look how the child loves you.

713
01:01:32,567 --> 01:01:35,566
She wants to take care of you.

714
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:41,269
Send her to me Poppa.

715
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:46,026
She's my daughter again.

716
01:01:46,196 --> 01:01:48,815
What we gotta do is take care
of the bodyguard...

717
01:01:48,946 --> 01:01:52,063
and get Filargi down to
our van in the basement.

718
01:01:52,197 --> 01:01:53,987
- Ok?
- Ok.

719
01:01:54,114 --> 01:01:56,236
There's only three apartments
on the floor.

720
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,657
How are you gonna do that?

721
01:02:02,325 --> 01:02:04,316
One of them is empty,
this one we rent it.

722
01:02:04,534 --> 01:02:07,533
The other one,
we send matinee theater tickets...

723
01:02:07,660 --> 01:02:10,943
and heavy duty lunch invitation
to the dame that lives there.

724
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:13,531
A limo picks her up
and brings her back.

725
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:16,073
She thinks it's a prize
she's getting...

726
01:02:16,204 --> 01:02:19,735
for working at the public library
for sixty years.

727
01:02:19,871 --> 01:02:21,827
She'll go alright.

728
01:02:22,789 --> 01:02:26,285
Everyday Filargi's bodyguard
comes out first.

729
01:02:26,415 --> 01:02:28,205
He goes to the elevator,
pushes the button.

730
01:02:28,499 --> 01:02:30,536
When he gets there,
he puts it on hold.

731
01:02:30,666 --> 01:02:34,162
Then he goes back to the apartment
and knocks on the door.

732
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,366
That's when Filargi comes out.

733
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:39,999
You know guys, you need a woman
on this stand.

734
01:02:41,293 --> 01:02:43,866
- A woman?
- Yeah.

735
01:02:44,003 --> 01:02:47,120
A woman comes out of
the south apartment holding a baby.

736
01:02:47,254 --> 01:02:50,536
After Filargi's bodyguard gets him
out of his apartment.

737
01:02:50,671 --> 01:02:52,995
She smiles at them,
she goes gogo gaga at the baby.

738
01:02:53,089 --> 01:02:55,328
She tosses the little darling
at the bodyguard...

739
01:02:55,422 --> 01:02:56,832
who naturally tries to catch it.

740
01:02:56,923 --> 01:02:59,875
While he's doing that, she gets her
piece out and covers him.

741
01:03:00,007 --> 01:03:03,290
You come out of the other apartment
and take Filargi down to the garage.

742
01:03:03,383 --> 01:03:07,247
She takes the bodyguard back into
Filargi's apartment and does the job.

743
01:03:07,676 --> 01:03:09,797
That's good.

744
01:03:09,927 --> 01:03:11,834
For Christ sake.

745
01:03:12,177 --> 01:03:14,168
Where we gonna get a baby?

746
01:03:14,303 --> 01:03:17,384
Where we gonna find a broad
who would do something like this?

747
01:03:17,511 --> 01:03:19,882
Where?
Here, me.

748
01:03:20,013 --> 01:03:21,340
We get a fake baby.

749
01:03:21,513 --> 01:03:23,800
Good thinking Irene.

750
01:03:23,972 --> 01:03:25,169
You guys work it out.

751
01:03:25,306 --> 01:03:28,506
I got a terrific dinner almost ready.
Just a couple of minutes.

752
01:03:30,057 --> 01:03:32,890
Pop, what's the matter with you?

753
01:03:33,224 --> 01:03:36,556
I didn't get married so
my wife could go on working.

754
01:03:36,642 --> 01:03:39,096
Charley, she's right
and you know it.

755
01:03:39,226 --> 01:03:42,261
Throwing the baby.
Well that's strictly a masterpiece.

756
01:03:42,726 --> 01:03:46,343
The Prizzi's ever found out
I used my own wife on this job...

757
01:03:46,478 --> 01:03:48,433
I couldn't hold my head up.

758
01:03:48,603 --> 01:03:51,437
I'd be the laughing stock
of every family...

759
01:03:51,563 --> 01:03:53,104
in Brooklyn and New York.

760
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:55,643
Who's gonna know Charley?

761
01:03:55,772 --> 01:03:59,103
And what's that compared to sixty,
seventy million dollars.

762
01:04:04,649 --> 01:04:07,399
Gentlemen, dinner is served.

763
01:04:27,447 --> 01:04:29,984
- Maerose!
- Coming Poppa!

764
01:05:18,294 --> 01:05:22,124
Jees Mae, you look awful!

765
01:05:23,295 --> 01:05:26,211
My beautiful daughter
has turned into an old woman.

766
01:05:28,505 --> 01:05:31,374
Charley Partanna did this to you.

767
01:05:32,173 --> 01:05:35,456
He had a chance to become part
of the Prizzi family.

768
01:05:35,591 --> 01:05:38,163
He had no use for you.

769
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:42,211
Oh, he had a use for me Poppa.

770
01:05:44,134 --> 01:05:46,838
He came to my place in New York
the night before...

771
01:05:46,927 --> 01:05:49,463
he married that woman
in California.

772
01:05:50,386 --> 01:05:53,338
And he forced himself on me.

773
01:05:54,138 --> 01:05:56,508
And he did it to me.

774
01:05:58,014 --> 01:06:00,929
- He did it to you?
- Yeah, Poppa.

775
01:06:01,056 --> 01:06:04,886
Screwed me three times, maybe four.
I can't remember.

776
01:06:05,016 --> 01:06:07,504
You whore.
Shut your filthy mouth you here.

777
01:06:07,808 --> 01:06:10,380
How can you say such things
to your own father.

778
01:06:12,142 --> 01:06:15,556
He done that to you, Charley?

779
01:06:15,685 --> 01:06:17,842
- You sure?
- Am I sure, Poppa.

780
01:06:17,977 --> 01:06:20,218
You should see the size of him.

781
01:06:20,312 --> 01:06:21,852
- You should.
- Shut up.

782
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,265
How can you say such things
to your father?

783
01:06:24,979 --> 01:06:26,353
Where's your honour?

784
01:06:26,521 --> 01:06:30,730
Are you kidding Poppa?
I have no honour anymore.

785
01:07:06,782 --> 01:07:08,986
Here Poppa.

786
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:47,075
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

787
01:07:50,628 --> 01:07:51,906
Do you mind?

788
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:04,126
Catch!

789
01:08:13,133 --> 01:08:14,674
I must have the wrong floor.

790
01:08:15,801 --> 01:08:17,293
Oh my God!

791
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:30,502
No blood I think.

792
01:08:30,638 --> 01:08:32,879
Ok, come on!
Lets move them!

793
01:08:42,975 --> 01:08:45,345
I had to hit her Charley,
she was looking straight at me.

794
01:08:45,475 --> 01:08:47,514
You done right, really.

795
01:09:03,814 --> 01:09:04,927
I can't get over it.

796
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:10,641
I mean what kind of creep
wouldn't catch a baby.

797
01:09:10,774 --> 01:09:13,773
If it was real,
it could have been crippled for life.

798
01:09:14,609 --> 01:09:17,726
He wasn't
the bodyguard of the baby.

799
01:09:21,026 --> 01:09:24,191
When the Don gets what he wants
and when I ask him for some time...

800
01:09:24,319 --> 01:09:27,022
we're gonna go to the old country
have a real honeymoon.

801
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,976
Maybe even a real baby.

802
01:09:30,113 --> 01:09:32,317
Oh, God Charley,
I love you.

803
01:09:52,868 --> 01:09:54,410
What do you want?

804
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:56,948
Come on!

805
01:10:07,831 --> 01:10:09,205
- See you at dinner.
- Ok, dear.

806
01:10:44,008 --> 01:10:47,705
Recapping our top stories
at this hour.

807
01:10:47,884 --> 01:10:51,001
- Come on Charley.
- Shut up, I wanna hear this.

808
01:10:51,134 --> 01:10:53,375
Police have now identified
both victims.

809
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:55,797
One of whom was
a police captains wife.

810
01:10:55,885 --> 01:10:56,880
Shit!

811
01:10:57,052 --> 01:10:59,210
The man found with her
was the bodyguard...

812
01:10:59,387 --> 01:11:01,093
of the bank President
Robert Finlay.

813
01:11:01,220 --> 01:11:03,295
Finlay's apartment is right
next door...

814
01:11:03,388 --> 01:11:05,593
to the one where
the two bodies were found.

815
01:11:05,680 --> 01:11:07,386
Bank officers
reported him missing...

816
01:11:07,639 --> 01:11:09,677
when he didn't show up
at a meeting on Monday morning.

817
01:11:09,765 --> 01:11:12,336
Police now speculate
he has been kidnapped.

818
01:11:12,431 --> 01:11:15,964
They also believe
that Victoria Calhain...

819
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:19,264
stumbled accidentally into
the scene of the crime...

820
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:20,464
and the kidnappers...

821
01:11:20,601 --> 01:11:23,552
Look at this.
First she gotta push the wrong button.

822
01:11:24,435 --> 01:11:27,931
Then the broad turns out to be
a cops wife.

823
01:11:28,644 --> 01:11:30,517
Call's still waiting Charley.

824
01:11:43,273 --> 01:11:44,268
Yeah?

825
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:45,602
Hi, darling!

826
01:11:46,858 --> 01:11:48,895
Were you watching the TV just now?

827
01:11:49,233 --> 01:11:53,098
Yeah, a police captains wife.
I couldn't believe my luck.

828
01:11:53,277 --> 01:11:56,191
All hell is gonna break out
over this, Irene.

829
01:11:56,319 --> 01:11:59,151
Cops don't like it much
when we hit one of their wives.

830
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:01,103
But it was an accident.

831
01:12:24,743 --> 01:12:26,449
Mr. Ciglione?

832
01:12:35,371 --> 01:12:36,828
Mr. Ciglione.

833
01:12:44,207 --> 01:12:47,620
Mrs. Prizzi would you like to
come to my office please?

834
01:12:48,082 --> 01:12:50,786
Mrs. Prizzi,
would you care for a drink?

835
01:12:51,292 --> 01:12:53,863
I'll have a Babycham.

836
01:12:54,001 --> 01:12:54,996
Babycham?

837
01:12:55,126 --> 01:12:57,496
You heard what the lady said.
A Babycham!

838
01:12:57,585 --> 01:12:58,615
Okay!

839
01:12:59,836 --> 01:13:01,578
Would you please sit down
Mrs. Prizzi?

840
01:13:01,795 --> 01:13:03,833
I think I got something for you.

841
01:13:04,295 --> 01:13:05,290
Capulla!

842
01:13:08,379 --> 01:13:09,375
Come on!

843
01:13:10,964 --> 01:13:12,244
Sit down over there.

844
01:13:22,426 --> 01:13:23,669
That the broad?

845
01:13:24,759 --> 01:13:25,790
Tell the lady.

846
01:13:26,677 --> 01:13:30,457
I was using this camper as
a trick room in the parking lot.

847
01:13:30,761 --> 01:13:34,293
As I lifted up my head from the job.
I saw this woman in hot pants...

848
01:13:34,428 --> 01:13:38,554
running to the lights of the car where
Louis Paulo caught it in the head.

849
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:41,466
She's in the car a couple minutes.

850
01:13:41,597 --> 01:13:44,087
Then she gets out
and goes to the trunk...

851
01:13:44,223 --> 01:13:47,091
takes out a satchel
and then she fades.

852
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:49,216
The same woman?

853
01:13:50,683 --> 01:13:52,306
Yeah it's the same one.

854
01:14:10,854 --> 01:14:13,937
Why don't you go on one
of those cruises, honey?

855
01:14:21,816 --> 01:14:26,558
You've reached the answering
machine for 5554375.

856
01:14:26,692 --> 01:14:28,814
Nobody can take your call
right now.

857
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:31,059
Please leave a message
after the beep.

858
01:14:32,360 --> 01:14:37,268
Meet me on the promenade,
Brooklyn 7pm tomorrow.

859
01:14:37,362 --> 01:14:38,820
Full price.

860
01:14:38,946 --> 01:14:42,940
I'll be on a bench at the end
reading "Popular mechanics".

861
01:15:27,918 --> 01:15:30,667
Are you the contractor?

862
01:15:34,169 --> 01:15:35,578
How much?

863
01:15:36,086 --> 01:15:37,793
It depends.

864
01:15:38,254 --> 01:15:40,659
Some hits are tricky.
Who is it?

865
01:15:40,837 --> 01:15:43,872
A Brooklyn fellow,
Charley Partanna.

866
01:15:44,047 --> 01:15:45,244
Charley Partanna?

867
01:15:59,593 --> 01:16:04,547
Amalia told me that
you wanna thank me...

868
01:16:04,677 --> 01:16:07,047
for bringing you home?

869
01:16:07,428 --> 01:16:12,087
Well,
you are blood of my blood!

870
01:16:12,637 --> 01:16:14,510
You're flesh of my flesh!

871
01:16:15,722 --> 01:16:19,171
And as long as I'm able...

872
01:16:19,306 --> 01:16:21,214
I'm gonna think about
your well being.

873
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:23,595
Thank you, grandfather.

874
01:16:24,016 --> 01:16:26,801
You have drawn me back
from purgatory.

875
01:16:30,017 --> 01:16:32,637
I wish you had been a son.

876
01:16:32,769 --> 01:16:35,388
You are a true Prizzi.

877
01:16:36,061 --> 01:16:38,136
Hey, you like to have a cookie?

878
01:16:41,646 --> 01:16:44,680
It is I who must offer you a gift
grandfather.

879
01:16:44,813 --> 01:16:46,851
A gesture of my gratitude.

880
01:16:46,981 --> 01:16:50,975
I have always enjoyed gifts.

881
01:17:00,817 --> 01:17:05,143
Who's this handsome lady?

882
01:17:05,902 --> 01:17:09,316
That is Charley Partanna's wife,
grandfather.

883
01:17:16,321 --> 01:17:17,483
Well?

884
01:17:20,031 --> 01:17:23,528
My gift to you is not only
the pictures...

885
01:17:24,116 --> 01:17:26,071
but also what they mean.

886
01:17:27,033 --> 01:17:30,032
Louis Palo was killed
in the parking lot in Las Vegas.

887
01:17:30,117 --> 01:17:31,113
I know.

888
01:17:31,201 --> 01:17:33,820
I took these pictures there.

889
01:17:34,952 --> 01:17:38,484
There was a woman who had been
turning tricks in a camper...

890
01:17:38,619 --> 01:17:40,029
in the parking lot.

891
01:17:40,287 --> 01:17:42,526
She told me she saw this woman...

892
01:17:42,704 --> 01:17:44,280
get into a car with Palo.

893
01:17:44,621 --> 01:17:48,367
After a minute she got out,
went to the trunk...

894
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,287
and took out a satchel.

895
01:17:52,124 --> 01:17:53,948
This woman?

896
01:17:54,082 --> 01:17:55,741
Yes, grandfather.

897
01:17:58,875 --> 01:18:00,700
She killed Palo...

898
01:18:01,084 --> 01:18:05,328
and she stole 720 dollars
from us.

899
01:18:05,835 --> 01:18:08,324
She gave back half to save herself.

900
01:18:11,170 --> 01:18:14,370
What do you want me to do?

901
01:18:15,421 --> 01:18:16,665
She dishonoured us!

902
01:18:17,088 --> 01:18:19,245
You're like me.

903
01:18:19,755 --> 01:18:22,079
We forgive nothing.

904
01:18:27,258 --> 01:18:31,750
What would that do
to Charley Partanna?

905
01:18:32,342 --> 01:18:35,506
She must pay
like anybody else.

906
01:18:35,676 --> 01:18:37,419
Oh. What you ask...

907
01:18:37,510 --> 01:18:41,884
that would cause Charley
great pain.

908
01:18:42,929 --> 01:18:45,298
What is that compared to
the honour of the Prizzi's?

909
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:49,759
Charley is like my son.

910
01:18:49,889 --> 01:18:54,880
I pledged to be his second father
on the day that he was born.

911
01:18:55,682 --> 01:18:57,388
- Grandfather.
- Shut up.

912
01:19:00,017 --> 01:19:02,470
Have another cookie my dear.

913
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:16,636
We're here to tell you what we're
telling all the families in this town.

914
01:19:16,771 --> 01:19:18,264
All contracts are off...

915
01:19:18,396 --> 01:19:20,850
until we get who ever killed
Captain Calhain's wife.

916
01:19:22,023 --> 01:19:23,729
How do you mean Davey?

917
01:19:23,856 --> 01:19:28,349
It means nothing is happening.
We're coming down hard on you.

918
01:19:28,941 --> 01:19:31,347
A police captains' wife
has been murdered.

919
01:19:32,151 --> 01:19:34,355
You got narcotics right?

920
01:19:34,484 --> 01:19:36,108
Plus loan sharking.

921
01:19:36,235 --> 01:19:39,850
Plus horse books, football,
basketball and boxing.

922
01:19:40,486 --> 01:19:43,484
Not to mention what you take out of
restaurants in the trucking business.

923
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,650
Plus a couple of millions
in TV sets...

924
01:19:45,779 --> 01:19:48,315
that fall of the back of a truck
every week.

925
01:19:48,571 --> 01:19:51,902
We're gonna put them all out of
business, as of now.

926
01:19:53,448 --> 01:19:55,522
It'll cost us hundreds of thousands...

927
01:19:55,615 --> 01:19:57,523
but that the way it's gonna be.

928
01:19:58,366 --> 01:20:01,814
I've been doing business with
the Police commissioners squad.

929
01:20:01,908 --> 01:20:03,366
For over 40 years now.

930
01:20:04,201 --> 01:20:05,907
We always went under one rule:

931
01:20:05,992 --> 01:20:08,114
You take our money,
you leave us alone.

932
01:20:09,327 --> 01:20:12,907
The more pressure you put on us
the more money you cost yourselves.

933
01:20:13,745 --> 01:20:15,451
There ain't a cop on the squad...

934
01:20:15,536 --> 01:20:18,738
who's had to get by on straight
police pay for a long time.

935
01:20:19,330 --> 01:20:21,155
Yeah.

936
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:25,740
Look Angelo, our people don't like
this any better than you do.

937
01:20:25,873 --> 01:20:28,243
But this one's a point of honour
with us.

938
01:20:28,374 --> 01:20:29,997
Do you understand that Angelo?

939
01:20:56,173 --> 01:20:59,171
You're a fine looking woman.

940
01:21:00,091 --> 01:21:02,959
Charley Partanna is a lucky man.

941
01:21:03,883 --> 01:21:06,254
Thank you for coming.

942
01:21:07,301 --> 01:21:11,426
What a surprise you gave us
with this sudden wedding.

943
01:21:11,594 --> 01:21:14,676
Well, we just sort of swept
each other away.

944
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:18,669
I understand,
I was young once.

945
01:21:19,637 --> 01:21:20,633
This...

946
01:21:21,305 --> 01:21:25,880
marriage of yours
has troubled me.

947
01:21:27,598 --> 01:21:29,388
Why Don Corrado?

948
01:21:29,556 --> 01:21:33,006
The people at Prizzi's place
in Vegas...

949
01:21:33,141 --> 01:21:35,215
have looked at pictures of you.

950
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:38,135
They've told us that
you killed Louis Palo.

951
01:21:43,561 --> 01:21:47,093
Now, under ordinary
circumstances...

952
01:21:47,228 --> 01:21:49,433
you would have to be punished...

953
01:21:49,563 --> 01:21:53,889
cause those who steal must pay.

954
01:21:54,731 --> 01:21:57,812
You're the wife of my God son.

955
01:21:58,231 --> 01:22:03,732
I've searched to find some way
to show you clemency.

956
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:06,309
What can I do?

957
01:22:06,567 --> 01:22:10,099
Well you got the other half of
the 720 dollars?

958
01:22:10,944 --> 01:22:11,938
Yes.

959
01:22:12,068 --> 01:22:14,190
Was Charley in this with you?

960
01:22:14,319 --> 01:22:15,314
No.

961
01:22:16,402 --> 01:22:19,567
He believed me when I told him
the half was Marxie's split.

962
01:22:19,696 --> 01:22:22,978
He didn't know that I had anything
to do with it or that I killed Louis.

963
01:22:23,113 --> 01:22:25,235
Good.

964
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:28,062
Now you have five days...

965
01:22:29,782 --> 01:22:34,274
to get the 360 together,
give them back...

966
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:39,030
together with
a 50 percent penalty...

967
01:22:39,159 --> 01:22:40,700
for what you have done to us.

968
01:22:41,452 --> 01:22:45,149
Will five days be enough time
for you?

969
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:46,323
Five days?

970
01:22:47,412 --> 01:22:50,031
Yeah, I can get it together
in five days.

971
01:22:59,331 --> 01:23:00,409
Irene?

972
01:23:00,915 --> 01:23:02,408
Charley.

973
01:23:05,041 --> 01:23:06,415
How come you're in L. A?

974
01:23:06,583 --> 01:23:08,954
I had business to attend to,
didn't you see my note?

975
01:23:09,750 --> 01:23:11,576
Can you get out here this weekend?

976
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:14,832
I don't think so.

977
01:23:18,545 --> 01:23:19,576
Tell me.

978
01:23:20,545 --> 01:23:21,919
Tell you what.

979
01:23:22,504 --> 01:23:23,997
Tell me I love you.

980
01:23:26,046 --> 01:23:27,374
I love you.

981
01:23:27,505 --> 01:23:30,836
Love you too, and it's real.

982
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:34,248
May not be scientific, but it's real.

983
01:23:35,050 --> 01:23:36,246
Scientific?

984
01:23:37,550 --> 01:23:41,082
I read it in a magazine.
According to a doctor...

985
01:23:41,217 --> 01:23:42,924
everyone is trying to get...

986
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:46,133
what they thought
they needed from their mothers...

987
01:23:46,260 --> 01:23:47,718
but they didn't get it.

988
01:23:49,803 --> 01:23:51,960
I don't even remember my mother.

989
01:23:52,095 --> 01:23:54,585
That's the amazing part.

990
01:23:55,180 --> 01:23:58,261
There's something in you
that knows anyways.

991
01:23:58,389 --> 01:24:00,048
The magazine said so.

992
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,346
That's what love is.

993
01:24:02,806 --> 01:24:06,256
When you find someone
who'll give you...

994
01:24:06,600 --> 01:24:10,013
what you think you wanted
when you were a baby...

995
01:24:10,350 --> 01:24:11,892
but you didn't get it.

996
01:24:12,018 --> 01:24:13,095
A doctor wrote this.

997
01:24:14,351 --> 01:24:16,675
Charley forget doctors.

998
01:24:17,603 --> 01:24:20,518
Better yet,
lets play doctor.

999
01:24:23,103 --> 01:24:25,474
On the phone?

1000
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:32,895
Doctor Partanna
I have this itch...

1001
01:24:33,399 --> 01:24:34,891
Well?

1002
01:25:27,204 --> 01:25:29,160
They're not kidding around
this time.

1003
01:25:30,247 --> 01:25:32,154
It's gonna get worse.

1004
01:25:33,373 --> 01:25:36,455
They're gonna keep leaning on us...

1005
01:25:36,624 --> 01:25:38,496
until we give them whoever it was...

1006
01:25:38,624 --> 01:25:40,829
that hit that Cops wife.

1007
01:25:41,334 --> 01:25:43,454
All I know is that...

1008
01:25:44,918 --> 01:25:46,162
the cops tell us...

1009
01:25:46,293 --> 01:25:50,703
the guy who got snatched the day
they did the number on the cops wife...

1010
01:25:51,086 --> 01:25:56,954
was in big business
with the Prizzi family.

1011
01:26:00,588 --> 01:26:02,627
I wanna make this a short meet.

1012
01:26:03,464 --> 01:26:05,669
I wanna put it to a vote right now...

1013
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:09,047
that Dominic Prizzi...

1014
01:26:10,299 --> 01:26:13,049
tells us what the hell
he's gonna do about it.

1015
01:26:13,717 --> 01:26:14,878
Alright?

1016
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:17,461
Raise your hands.

1017
01:26:19,593 --> 01:26:21,668
Hold the hands.

1018
01:26:23,928 --> 01:26:26,464
Who do you think
you're talking to?

1019
01:26:28,221 --> 01:26:30,259
I am Dominic Prizzi.

1020
01:26:31,888 --> 01:26:35,669
When most of you people was walking
around with holes in your pants...

1021
01:26:35,806 --> 01:26:38,130
I was holding up gas stations.

1022
01:26:39,141 --> 01:26:41,973
We was the biggest family
in the country.

1023
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:47,308
And now most of you have figured out
how to push broads...

1024
01:26:47,851 --> 01:26:49,759
we're still the biggest.

1025
01:26:50,311 --> 01:26:53,309
We lose more when the cops
get in an uproar...

1026
01:26:53,478 --> 01:26:54,971
than any of you.

1027
01:26:55,812 --> 01:26:57,767
Now we don't like it...

1028
01:26:58,938 --> 01:27:02,802
but you ain't gonna tell us
how to run our business.

1029
01:27:03,897 --> 01:27:07,429
We ain't taking any shit
from any outsiders...

1030
01:27:07,565 --> 01:27:10,019
about the family business...

1031
01:27:12,357 --> 01:27:20,442
especially from a scummy little pimp
like you, Señor Bocca.

1032
01:27:34,780 --> 01:27:37,733
I hope you like it!

1033
01:27:41,949 --> 01:27:43,324
Thank you.

1034
01:27:49,534 --> 01:27:54,027
Padrino, you never saw anything
like this here...

1035
01:27:54,869 --> 01:27:58,283
the broad pushes the wrong button
on the elevator.

1036
01:27:58,412 --> 01:28:00,652
The door drops just in the minute...

1037
01:28:00,829 --> 01:28:03,698
when the second man drops
the bodyguard.

1038
01:28:03,830 --> 01:28:05,572
The woman is standing there.

1039
01:28:06,205 --> 01:28:07,913
She makes all three of us.

1040
01:28:09,165 --> 01:28:11,868
She had to go.

1041
01:28:12,124 --> 01:28:16,071
I'm sure you didn't act
without thinking.

1042
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:19,410
That's why I called you here today.

1043
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:22,156
You're a thinker.

1044
01:28:24,794 --> 01:28:27,958
Dominic is a sick man...

1045
01:28:29,337 --> 01:28:32,122
and the return of
his daughter brought him no ease.

1046
01:28:32,296 --> 01:28:34,371
He has got older.

1047
01:28:34,922 --> 01:28:37,671
I'm gonna move Dominic out
to Vegas...

1048
01:28:37,881 --> 01:28:40,287
and make you boss.

1049
01:28:49,092 --> 01:28:52,589
I'm speechless Padrino.

1050
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:01,464
This...

1051
01:29:01,763 --> 01:29:03,136
is an honour...

1052
01:29:05,430 --> 01:29:07,422
beyond my dreams.

1053
01:29:10,223 --> 01:29:12,464
What could I do to show
my gratitude?

1054
01:29:12,599 --> 01:29:16,345
For the time being
this must be our secret.

1055
01:29:16,475 --> 01:29:19,010
You must not even tell your father.

1056
01:29:23,435 --> 01:29:26,054
I don't understand Padrino.

1057
01:29:26,144 --> 01:29:31,265
We'll announce everything once
the Filargi thing is settled.

1058
01:29:31,562 --> 01:29:37,596
Then Dominic will move out
and you'll move in.

1059
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:03,315
God, I missed you.

1060
01:30:04,905 --> 01:30:06,860
So I gathered.

1061
01:30:09,072 --> 01:30:10,779
What's been happening?

1062
01:30:13,240 --> 01:30:14,520
Plenty.

1063
01:30:16,325 --> 01:30:18,445
Just had a meeting with the Don.

1064
01:30:19,450 --> 01:30:21,109
A private audience.

1065
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:24,112
Here.

1066
01:30:26,244 --> 01:30:27,985
He wants me to take over.

1067
01:30:28,244 --> 01:30:30,698
He says that Dominic is sick.

1068
01:30:30,870 --> 01:30:32,611
They're gonna send him to Vegas.

1069
01:30:32,828 --> 01:30:34,370
I'm gonna be the boss.

1070
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:35,954
Charley,
that's fantastic.

1071
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:37,655
I don't know.

1072
01:30:38,455 --> 01:30:40,114
Sounds fishy to me.

1073
01:30:42,874 --> 01:30:44,247
Number one...

1074
01:30:45,957 --> 01:30:48,411
should have been Dominic
told me...

1075
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:50,910
instead of the Don.

1076
01:30:51,042 --> 01:30:53,993
Well maybe the Don hasn't broken
the news to Dominic yet?

1077
01:30:55,251 --> 01:30:56,875
Whether he has or he hasn't...

1078
01:30:57,419 --> 01:30:59,409
he would have told Pop.

1079
01:31:00,294 --> 01:31:04,538
He don't decide what Mass to go to
unless he talks to Pop.

1080
01:31:05,587 --> 01:31:09,250
Big deal like this they'd go over
every angle fifteen times.

1081
01:31:10,922 --> 01:31:12,250
They didn't?

1082
01:31:12,339 --> 01:31:13,418
No.

1083
01:31:13,757 --> 01:31:15,130
And worse than that.

1084
01:31:15,882 --> 01:31:19,712
The Don says for me not to tell Pop.

1085
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:22,583
Wanna know what I think, Irene?

1086
01:31:22,717 --> 01:31:23,796
What?

1087
01:31:28,010 --> 01:31:30,132
I think they're setting me up.

1088
01:31:37,054 --> 01:31:39,046
I think you're right Charley.

1089
01:31:39,180 --> 01:31:41,218
I think they're after our scalps.

1090
01:31:41,513 --> 01:31:43,137
How do you know?

1091
01:31:44,265 --> 01:31:46,091
I gotta a couple of things to tell you.

1092
01:31:47,849 --> 01:31:50,255
I went out to L. A on orders
of the Don.

1093
01:31:50,558 --> 01:31:52,549
He told me to bring back the money
I took from Louis Palo...

1094
01:31:52,683 --> 01:31:54,675
plus 50 percent interest.

1095
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:57,215
So you did ice Louis Palo.

1096
01:31:57,393 --> 01:31:59,882
You swore to me that you didn't.
You lied to me.

1097
01:32:00,019 --> 01:32:02,175
I lied to you because
you wanted me to.

1098
01:32:02,311 --> 01:32:04,267
I only told you what
you wanted to be true.

1099
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:06,475
And I told the Don
it was all my doing.

1100
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:08,476
Jesus Charley, I'm so sorry.

1101
01:32:13,022 --> 01:32:15,642
What's the other thing you got to tell
me?

1102
01:32:16,148 --> 01:32:18,767
Dominic has put out
a contract on you.

1103
01:32:19,691 --> 01:32:22,311
What are you fucking nuts?

1104
01:32:22,525 --> 01:32:24,812
No, Charley,
I'm the contractor.

1105
01:32:27,360 --> 01:32:30,275
Dominic hires my own wife
to clip me?

1106
01:32:30,610 --> 01:32:33,100
Charley he didn't know
I was your wife.

1107
01:32:33,320 --> 01:32:35,109
He just wanted the best.

1108
01:32:36,987 --> 01:32:38,066
Charley!

1109
01:32:38,405 --> 01:32:41,652
Honey,
let's go to Hong Kong tonight.

1110
01:32:42,239 --> 01:32:44,029
What are you talking about?

1111
01:32:44,156 --> 01:32:46,194
Let's beat it while we still can.

1112
01:32:46,323 --> 01:32:47,354
Beat it?

1113
01:32:47,490 --> 01:32:50,323
Yeah, scram, split,
let's make a run for it.

1114
01:32:50,449 --> 01:32:53,117
Look I know this guy in Hong Kong
who can give us...

1115
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,824
new prints even new faces
in a few days.

1116
01:32:54,992 --> 01:32:57,528
We can get out of this crazy world,
we can start fresh.

1117
01:32:57,618 --> 01:33:00,237
We can be together all the time.

1118
01:33:00,368 --> 01:33:01,363
Hong Kong?

1119
01:33:01,494 --> 01:33:03,699
Hong Kong, Brazil, South Africa.

1120
01:33:04,245 --> 01:33:06,568
It doesn't matter.
What matters is us together.

1121
01:33:07,329 --> 01:33:11,537
Listen, I've been doing three four
hits a year for the last few years.

1122
01:33:11,663 --> 01:33:13,121
Most of them full pay.

1123
01:33:14,914 --> 01:33:16,490
That many?

1124
01:33:16,748 --> 01:33:20,245
Well it's not many if you consider
the size of the population.

1125
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:24,288
The thing is
I got almost a million.

1126
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:27,036
In a safe deposit box on the coast.

1127
01:33:27,167 --> 01:33:29,242
You must have at least
that much put away.

1128
01:33:29,376 --> 01:33:30,918
We can take all the money
and make a run for it.

1129
01:33:31,002 --> 01:33:32,909
We can go where we want,
do what we want...

1130
01:33:33,002 --> 01:33:34,875
we can be together
all the time.

1131
01:33:35,003 --> 01:33:37,622
Please Charley let's just go
before they get us.

1132
01:33:37,753 --> 01:33:39,661
They're not gonna get us.

1133
01:33:39,796 --> 01:33:42,332
Piss on the Prizzi's.

1134
01:33:43,088 --> 01:33:45,791
These people can't win all the time.

1135
01:33:46,048 --> 01:33:48,371
There has to be a way to beat them.
Bastards.

1136
01:33:53,591 --> 01:33:55,499
Let's call Pop.

1137
01:33:57,259 --> 01:34:01,419
And the Don told you to keep
making you boss a secret from me?

1138
01:34:01,594 --> 01:34:02,589
Yeah.

1139
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:07,673
And he told you he's letting you off
for giving him back the money?

1140
01:34:07,970 --> 01:34:09,629
Plus fifty percent.

1141
01:34:10,804 --> 01:34:14,585
And Dominic gave you a fifty dollar
down payment to hit Charley?

1142
01:34:14,763 --> 01:34:17,300
Absolutely.
Brand new bills.

1143
01:34:29,185 --> 01:34:30,807
Oh, he's hot.

1144
01:34:30,976 --> 01:34:32,932
I ain't never seen him this hot.

1145
01:34:51,607 --> 01:34:55,519
It's just business, just business.

1146
01:34:56,358 --> 01:34:57,899
What are we gonna do?

1147
01:34:58,025 --> 01:35:00,859
We have to take away the only thing
the Don wants,

1148
01:35:00,985 --> 01:35:03,308
Filargi.

1149
01:35:03,527 --> 01:35:07,142
You have to snatch Filargi again
This time from the Prizzi's.

1150
01:35:07,277 --> 01:35:09,648
How many people you got out there
holding him down?

1151
01:35:09,779 --> 01:35:10,774
Two.

1152
01:35:10,904 --> 01:35:12,942
My people,
they do whatever I tell them.

1153
01:35:13,071 --> 01:35:14,066
Good.

1154
01:35:14,196 --> 01:35:17,894
Filargi is worth seventy million,
maybe more to the Prizzi's.

1155
01:35:18,489 --> 01:35:20,279
Including the bank.

1156
01:35:20,657 --> 01:35:23,690
So what are you next to
seventy million dollars?

1157
01:35:23,824 --> 01:35:24,819
Nothing.

1158
01:35:24,949 --> 01:35:27,190
They'll take whatever deal
you offer them.

1159
01:35:27,325 --> 01:35:28,522
Yeah, no choice right.

1160
01:35:28,658 --> 01:35:33,117
They know we can let Filargi
go and testify against them.

1161
01:35:33,326 --> 01:35:34,950
Or even worse...

1162
01:35:35,827 --> 01:35:37,107
you can try and go into...

1163
01:35:37,245 --> 01:35:39,698
the Governments
witness protection programme...

1164
01:35:39,828 --> 01:35:42,531
and testify against
the Don and Dominic.

1165
01:35:42,829 --> 01:35:45,911
To a jury the colds facts would be
you shot the Captains wife...

1166
01:35:46,038 --> 01:35:50,364
on orders from the Don and Dominic
after they hired you for 150 dollars.

1167
01:35:51,915 --> 01:35:54,866
You're very dangerous to the Prizzi's,
Irene.

1168
01:35:55,249 --> 01:35:56,244
Yeah.

1169
01:35:56,499 --> 01:36:00,790
It could turn out to be a good thing
Irene zipped the police captains wife.

1170
01:36:01,251 --> 01:36:03,621
It could solve all our problems.

1171
01:37:01,684 --> 01:37:05,595
We're here tonight to honour
my son.

1172
01:37:06,352 --> 01:37:08,011
He's gonna leave us...

1173
01:37:08,393 --> 01:37:12,306
to live in a 935 dollar
house...

1174
01:37:12,395 --> 01:37:17,468
next to his own golf course
in Las Vegas, Nevada.

1175
01:37:19,772 --> 01:37:24,311
And I said to him,
from you, from my heart...

1176
01:37:25,106 --> 01:37:27,015
God speed you!

1177
01:37:28,816 --> 01:37:31,566
God bless you Dominic!

1178
01:37:35,484 --> 01:37:37,606
And I want to present you...

1179
01:37:37,735 --> 01:37:42,939
with these tokens of esteem
from your entire family.

1180
01:37:43,904 --> 01:37:46,606
Some going away presents.

1181
01:37:53,073 --> 01:37:56,355
A complete set of
Stealing silver golf clubs.

1182
01:37:59,033 --> 01:38:01,984
That bag is made out of the hide
of an elephant.

1183
01:38:02,116 --> 01:38:04,487
It's the only one
in the United States.

1184
01:38:05,243 --> 01:38:09,652
And one thousand of your favourite
Mexican cigars.

1185
01:38:10,619 --> 01:38:13,571
We're gonna have a song...

1186
01:38:13,745 --> 01:38:16,661
in celebration of this grand
occasion...

1187
01:38:16,787 --> 01:38:19,323
the great Tenor
Tomas Innovarata.

1188
01:39:10,010 --> 01:39:11,124
Get moving.

1189
01:39:15,720 --> 01:39:18,672
Holy shit boss.
Somebody done the job on Fingo.

1190
01:40:09,859 --> 01:40:12,396
The Bocca's.

1191
01:40:12,778 --> 01:40:18,561
This killing of the Police captain's
wife is costing us all too much.

1192
01:40:27,031 --> 01:40:29,152
I got something to read to you.

1193
01:40:30,698 --> 01:40:32,358
It's a letter.

1194
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:35,158
A letter?
Who from?

1195
01:40:36,492 --> 01:40:38,115
Charley.

1196
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,318
You all set?

1197
01:40:46,077 --> 01:40:47,737
Dear Eduardo...

1198
01:40:47,953 --> 01:40:51,070
You're probably hot right now
cause we took Filargi.

1199
01:40:51,704 --> 01:40:53,162
But when you hear
the reason why...

1200
01:40:53,497 --> 01:40:57,194
you and the Don are gonna understand
there was no other way we could go.

1201
01:40:58,123 --> 01:41:01,738
Dominic put out a contract on me.

1202
01:41:06,249 --> 01:41:07,529
He's a fucking liar!

1203
01:41:07,667 --> 01:41:10,583
You wanna hear the letter,
listen don't talk.

1204
01:41:10,751 --> 01:41:12,623
There's a 130 million dollars here
maybe more.

1205
01:41:12,960 --> 01:41:15,247
We've gotta renegotiate it
before we get it back.

1206
01:41:15,378 --> 01:41:18,495
Just shut up and listen.
Go on, sit down.

1207
01:41:18,878 --> 01:41:20,123
Go on.

1208
01:41:23,838 --> 01:41:25,960
Dominic will say
it's a lot of bullshit.

1209
01:41:28,964 --> 01:41:31,668
It so happens
he hired my own wife...

1210
01:41:31,799 --> 01:41:34,085
and gave her a down payment
of 50,000 dollars.

1211
01:41:34,883 --> 01:41:38,047
And my wife is sitting right next
to me and she's laughing like hell.

1212
01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:42,464
I personally think the Don found
Dominic on a doorstep...

1213
01:41:42,801 --> 01:41:46,085
because he's too dumb
to be a Prizzi.

1214
01:41:54,012 --> 01:41:57,676
The first thing I gotta have
before you get Filargi back...

1215
01:41:58,264 --> 01:42:00,800
is that you deliver
Dominic to me...

1216
01:42:01,265 --> 01:42:03,884
where I tell you
and when I tell you.

1217
01:42:04,015 --> 01:42:07,299
This time no contract,
I'll kill him myself.

1218
01:42:07,725 --> 01:42:09,680
Listen to the letter will ya' Dominic?

1219
01:42:09,808 --> 01:42:10,804
Come on.

1220
01:42:17,936 --> 01:42:20,341
For the main money
this is what I want.

1221
01:42:21,353 --> 01:42:25,182
23,014 dollars for expenses.

1222
01:42:26,146 --> 01:42:28,387
Then 50 dollars for my helper.

1223
01:42:29,814 --> 01:42:32,386
Of course the 150 dollars
that was promised my wife...

1224
01:42:32,565 --> 01:42:34,805
as second man in the Filargi scam.

1225
01:42:35,982 --> 01:42:38,353
Charley's wife was the second man?

1226
01:42:38,525 --> 01:42:41,523
She was the only way
we could take out the bodyguard.

1227
01:42:41,900 --> 01:42:44,769
Then I want all the insurance coverage
on Filargi's kidnap policy...

1228
01:42:44,902 --> 01:42:46,727
which is two million five.

1229
01:42:46,860 --> 01:42:50,144
- My God he's a real businessman.
- That's my boy.

1230
01:42:50,403 --> 01:42:52,892
We gotta make him an offer and
eventually we settle.

1231
01:42:54,279 --> 01:42:58,226
The way I see it, we get about
60 or 70 million dollars...

1232
01:42:58,322 --> 01:43:00,194
with about 5.9º/º sales costs...

1233
01:43:00,281 --> 01:43:03,232
if we give Charley everything he wants,
which we obviously won't.

1234
01:43:03,365 --> 01:43:06,399
And I am part of
the fucking sales cost.

1235
01:43:07,033 --> 01:43:08,656
Dominic...

1236
01:43:08,741 --> 01:43:10,982
take some blood pressure medicine,
will ya?

1237
01:43:11,367 --> 01:43:13,441
Charley is just making a point.

1238
01:43:13,742 --> 01:43:15,615
Everything is negotiable.

1239
01:43:17,119 --> 01:43:18,908
We go over to Poppa's...

1240
01:43:19,994 --> 01:43:21,785
we hash this thing out.

1241
01:43:22,953 --> 01:43:26,118
Come on!
Let's go!

1242
01:45:02,356 --> 01:45:05,058
- Somebody is dead?
- Yes,

1243
01:45:05,189 --> 01:45:07,975
Who?
Who's dead?

1244
01:45:08,440 --> 01:45:10,478
Poppa...

1245
01:45:10,983 --> 01:45:12,773
Dominic.

1246
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:20,480
The Bocca's again.

1247
01:45:27,112 --> 01:45:29,980
Oh Dominic!

1248
01:45:32,322 --> 01:45:35,854
He got old!

1249
01:45:37,657 --> 01:45:40,821
Maybe it was his daughter,
who knows.

1250
01:45:43,158 --> 01:45:45,563
I agreed to retire him...

1251
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,986
and I gave his job to Charley.

1252
01:45:49,952 --> 01:45:53,946
I told him to keep this secret
a little while...

1253
01:45:54,620 --> 01:45:56,527
until...

1254
01:45:56,661 --> 01:45:59,993
Dominic's banquet.

1255
01:46:00,621 --> 01:46:03,785
Now Charley is all mixed up...

1256
01:46:03,914 --> 01:46:05,573
and we gotta get him back.

1257
01:46:05,998 --> 01:46:09,494
Only Charley can hold everything
together here.

1258
01:46:26,878 --> 01:46:28,039
How you doing Pop?

1259
01:46:28,211 --> 01:46:30,879
Fine, everything alright?

1260
01:46:31,129 --> 01:46:33,748
Yeah, everything's quiet out here.

1261
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:35,338
That's better huh.

1262
01:46:37,673 --> 01:46:39,711
Sorry to drag you out here...

1263
01:46:39,840 --> 01:46:42,590
but I didn't want anyone
taking a pot shot at me.

1264
01:46:42,883 --> 01:46:45,798
When I told the Don about Dominic
putting out contract on you...

1265
01:46:45,925 --> 01:46:47,087
it knocked him out.

1266
01:46:47,175 --> 01:46:48,171
He couldn't believe it.

1267
01:46:48,800 --> 01:46:52,002
He told me with tears in his eyes
that he gotta straighten all this out.

1268
01:46:55,135 --> 01:46:57,293
He wasn't setting me up?

1269
01:46:58,220 --> 01:46:59,381
He said...

1270
01:46:59,511 --> 01:47:03,044
and I've known him for fifty years,
so it's like looking through his heart.

1271
01:47:03,347 --> 01:47:06,215
He said:
"We need Charley".

1272
01:47:08,139 --> 01:47:09,597
Oh, he said that?

1273
01:47:10,431 --> 01:47:13,181
The Don and me
don't have much time left.

1274
01:47:13,307 --> 01:47:15,179
The family has to keep going.

1275
01:47:15,391 --> 01:47:17,347
You're the only one that can run it.

1276
01:47:19,893 --> 01:47:21,800
Then everything is ok.

1277
01:47:21,934 --> 01:47:24,554
We don't have to hang on to Filargi.

1278
01:47:24,686 --> 01:47:26,842
The Don gave me his guarantee.

1279
01:47:29,395 --> 01:47:31,848
Tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock,
you bring Filargi...

1280
01:47:31,937 --> 01:47:34,308
at 42nd Street library
and let him out.

1281
01:47:34,730 --> 01:47:37,930
I'll tip off the cops and the FBI.
They'll be in his hotel room.

1282
01:47:39,189 --> 01:47:41,264
Ok Pop, want the paper?

1283
01:47:41,399 --> 01:47:43,224
Na, read it from cover to cover.

1284
01:47:43,357 --> 01:47:45,313
Jupiter was 6 at Vermont.

1285
01:47:46,108 --> 01:47:47,517
Ok.

1286
01:47:47,650 --> 01:47:50,318
By the way,
the insurance company paid off.

1287
01:47:51,735 --> 01:47:53,357
Take care of yourself Charley.

1288
01:48:07,197 --> 01:48:08,855
How are we gonna take Filargi in?

1289
01:48:09,989 --> 01:48:13,355
Pop's sending someone up on
the Palace to meet us.

1290
01:48:14,907 --> 01:48:18,072
We'll transfer him into the van
and I'll drive him into the city.

1291
01:48:18,242 --> 01:48:20,197
You stick with the plumber.

1292
01:48:20,325 --> 01:48:22,233
He'll drop you off at the apartment.

1293
01:48:24,368 --> 01:48:26,110
Tell me about the money Charley.

1294
01:48:28,495 --> 01:48:30,569
My end is 2,5 million...

1295
01:48:30,703 --> 01:48:32,529
plus I'm boss of the Prizzi's...

1296
01:48:32,704 --> 01:48:36,117
with heavy points in everything
the family does.

1297
01:48:38,331 --> 01:48:42,372
This time next week
we'll have all the money.

1298
01:48:42,498 --> 01:48:45,165
You mean to tell me you're gonna
turn over a hole ball of wax...

1299
01:48:45,290 --> 01:48:48,124
to some Sicilians who are gonna pay
you what they owe you next week.

1300
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:51,574
Honey I'm the boss.
They need me.

1301
01:48:51,834 --> 01:48:54,502
I gotta believe Pop.

1302
01:48:54,585 --> 01:48:56,540
They're not gonna screw us over now.

1303
01:48:57,669 --> 01:48:59,660
Well maybe Pop is in there
looking after your interests...

1304
01:48:59,836 --> 01:49:02,407
but that doesn't necessarily mean
he's looking after mine.

1305
01:49:03,254 --> 01:49:06,038
There is a real pressure to turn over
the second man.

1306
01:49:07,088 --> 01:49:08,747
You're my wife.

1307
01:49:08,880 --> 01:49:10,836
I'm your Polak wife.

1308
01:49:11,464 --> 01:49:13,870
Irene will you shape up, jees.

1309
01:49:14,799 --> 01:49:19,920
Ok, I'll shape up as soon as I get
my 900 dollars.

1310
01:49:22,092 --> 01:49:23,834
What 900 dollars?

1311
01:49:24,384 --> 01:49:27,087
The $720 from the Vegas scam...

1312
01:49:27,218 --> 01:49:29,672
plus the $180 that
Don made me pay as penalty.

1313
01:49:29,803 --> 01:49:33,085
That's 900 dollars.
I just want what's mine.

1314
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:38,251
That's Prizzi money honey, not yours.
You stole.

1315
01:49:38,638 --> 01:49:41,210
The Prizzi's got theirs back
from the insurance company.

1316
01:49:41,348 --> 01:49:42,510
Now I just want it back.

1317
01:49:42,848 --> 01:49:46,096
That ain't gonna make no sense
to the Prizzi's, honey.

1318
01:49:46,474 --> 01:49:49,840
Remember the words of the late,
great Marxie Heller.

1319
01:49:50,100 --> 01:49:54,046
We'd rather eat our children
than part with money.

1320
01:49:54,517 --> 01:49:56,805
Remember those words, honey.

1321
01:49:57,102 --> 01:49:58,476
I am Charley, I am.

1322
01:50:10,397 --> 01:50:11,890
Mr Filargi...

1323
01:50:13,356 --> 01:50:16,189
you were born a poor kid
in Naples right?

1324
01:50:16,315 --> 01:50:17,429
Yeah that's right.

1325
01:50:18,524 --> 01:50:20,314
You remember the Camorra?

1326
01:50:22,442 --> 01:50:25,855
The Camorra was small,
we're very big.

1327
01:50:26,609 --> 01:50:28,815
There's no where's we can't go.

1328
01:50:29,527 --> 01:50:32,098
They could lock you
in a steel room...

1329
01:50:32,194 --> 01:50:34,399
in a submarine
at the bottom of the ocean.

1330
01:50:34,529 --> 01:50:35,725
And we'd still get to you.

1331
01:50:36,820 --> 01:50:39,227
The cops are gonna talk to you.

1332
01:50:39,572 --> 01:50:43,234
If you tell them anything about who
took you, or where they took you.

1333
01:50:43,364 --> 01:50:45,356
We're gonna kill you.

1334
01:50:45,782 --> 01:50:47,654
Capiche?

1335
01:50:47,782 --> 01:50:49,240
I understand.

1336
01:50:49,824 --> 01:50:51,614
Good.

1337
01:50:53,492 --> 01:50:56,277
You're free Mr. Filargi,
good luck.

1338
01:50:58,785 --> 01:51:00,195
Yeah.

1339
01:51:04,495 --> 01:51:07,067
I've forgotten the Prizzi's already.

1340
01:51:09,454 --> 01:51:11,861
I got a request to make...

1341
01:51:12,081 --> 01:51:13,359
or Irene has.

1342
01:51:16,165 --> 01:51:17,872
What kind of request Charley?

1343
01:51:18,165 --> 01:51:20,073
She wants her money back.

1344
01:51:20,833 --> 01:51:22,243
What money?

1345
01:51:22,375 --> 01:51:25,457
The 540 she gave you for the Don.

1346
01:51:25,709 --> 01:51:29,371
Plus the 360 I took the night
I zipped Marxie Heller.

1347
01:51:29,501 --> 01:51:30,497
That money.

1348
01:51:31,502 --> 01:51:33,293
She's willing to forget about...

1349
01:51:33,378 --> 01:51:35,997
2,5 million for Filargi's insurance...

1350
01:51:36,629 --> 01:51:41,168
and the rest of what Dominic
owed her for the contract on me.

1351
01:51:43,089 --> 01:51:45,708
But she wants her 900 back.

1352
01:51:52,883 --> 01:51:55,419
With all the respect Charley...

1353
01:51:56,092 --> 01:51:58,048
your wife must be cracked.

1354
01:51:58,468 --> 01:52:01,301
Try and see it from
her point of view.

1355
01:52:01,718 --> 01:52:04,422
I mean you agreed to all that stuff
in the letter we sent...

1356
01:52:04,595 --> 01:52:06,301
when we had Filargi.

1357
01:52:07,262 --> 01:52:09,467
You made a commitment, Pop.

1358
01:52:11,137 --> 01:52:14,587
And anyways,
it was Irene's move...

1359
01:52:14,681 --> 01:52:17,134
that got Filargi out
in the first place.

1360
01:52:17,681 --> 01:52:19,922
We're gonna get the bank.

1361
01:52:20,057 --> 01:52:22,972
So, 900 doesn't seem
like so much money

1362
01:52:23,141 --> 01:52:25,346
Irene figures
she got it coming to her.

1363
01:52:28,267 --> 01:52:32,890
I glad that she's so foolish
and grasping.

1364
01:52:32,977 --> 01:52:36,391
Makes it a little easier
what we gotta do.

1365
01:52:40,646 --> 01:52:44,641
The family has decided that...

1366
01:52:44,730 --> 01:52:47,136
we've got to give the second man
to the cops.

1367
01:52:51,274 --> 01:52:53,430
Give Irene to the cops?

1368
01:52:53,774 --> 01:52:56,892
The family decided that...

1369
01:52:57,025 --> 01:52:59,894
we got one week to give up
the second man...

1370
01:53:00,068 --> 01:53:02,059
or we'll be at war.

1371
01:53:02,235 --> 01:53:06,360
War will cost us everything we got.

1372
01:53:06,528 --> 01:53:09,526
And that could mean the end
of the family.

1373
01:53:10,821 --> 01:53:11,816
Well Padrino.

1374
01:53:11,946 --> 01:53:15,727
You should never have married a
woman who wasn't in the environment.

1375
01:53:15,822 --> 01:53:16,900
That wasn't smart.

1376
01:53:16,989 --> 01:53:18,981
Might have been alright
if she was straight.

1377
01:53:19,073 --> 01:53:20,400
But she wasn't.

1378
01:53:25,449 --> 01:53:27,737
She gotta go.

1379
01:53:28,326 --> 01:53:31,573
And you gotta do the job on her,
Charley.

1380
01:53:31,951 --> 01:53:35,993
You're the only one who can get
close enough to do it.

1381
01:53:36,077 --> 01:53:37,701
Zip Irene?

1382
01:53:38,912 --> 01:53:40,452
Clip Irene?

1383
01:53:40,662 --> 01:53:42,949
If they take her alive
they're gonna make her talk.

1384
01:53:43,121 --> 01:53:44,449
And if she talks...

1385
01:53:44,955 --> 01:53:47,870
she's gonna drag us all to jail...

1386
01:53:47,997 --> 01:53:49,539
maybe even to the chair.

1387
01:53:50,207 --> 01:53:53,324
Filargi will go free and
we'll never get the bank.

1388
01:53:53,499 --> 01:53:55,122
There's no choice here.

1389
01:53:59,375 --> 01:54:03,038
How is doing a number on Irene
gonna satisfy the cops...

1390
01:54:03,126 --> 01:54:05,331
about the broad that pushed
the wrong button?

1391
01:54:06,544 --> 01:54:09,745
Filargi will identify
your wife's body...

1392
01:54:09,920 --> 01:54:11,497
and there will be no-one
to question.

1393
01:54:12,504 --> 01:54:14,329
Everybody will get
what they want...

1394
01:54:14,463 --> 01:54:17,248
and we can all go back
to doing business.

1395
01:54:18,964 --> 01:54:21,288
But Padrino...

1396
01:54:21,882 --> 01:54:23,789
she's my wife.

1397
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:25,715
I can't kill her.

1398
01:54:26,591 --> 01:54:28,463
Now, Charley...

1399
01:54:29,300 --> 01:54:34,635
you swore an oath of blood,
my blood and yours.

1400
01:54:34,801 --> 01:54:38,085
That you would always put
the family before...

1401
01:54:38,178 --> 01:54:40,583
anything else in your life.

1402
01:54:40,720 --> 01:54:43,091
I'm simply calling on you now...

1403
01:54:43,221 --> 01:54:45,461
to keep that sacred oath.

1404
01:54:48,556 --> 01:54:53,298
Irene is my family Padrino.
She's my wife.

1405
01:54:53,432 --> 01:54:56,881
She's a woman you've known
for only a few weeks.

1406
01:54:57,933 --> 01:54:59,556
She is your wife.

1407
01:54:59,808 --> 01:55:01,467
We are your life.

1408
01:55:01,600 --> 01:55:04,516
You're failing your oath...

1409
01:55:04,643 --> 01:55:08,934
when you covered up for her
in the Vegas scam.

1410
01:55:09,061 --> 01:55:15,060
A great sin
against your honour.

1411
01:55:16,146 --> 01:55:18,849
But this for this you must stone.

1412
01:55:19,064 --> 01:55:20,059
I need her.

1413
01:55:24,190 --> 01:55:26,394
Look at you's.

1414
01:55:27,899 --> 01:55:31,680
Pop, you've been alone
since Mamma died.

1415
01:55:33,234 --> 01:55:37,063
Padrino you've been alone
all my life.

1416
01:55:39,069 --> 01:55:42,103
Is that what you want for me,
to grow old like you?

1417
01:55:42,194 --> 01:55:47,647
With nothing but bodyguards and
money to keep me company?

1418
01:55:51,364 --> 01:55:54,067
Charley,
my beloved man.

1419
01:55:55,323 --> 01:55:57,894
You will be even more alone.

1420
01:55:58,824 --> 01:56:03,447
If you turn you back on us,
we are your blood.

1421
01:56:05,951 --> 01:56:09,318
Jees, I feel like I'm drowning
or something.

1422
01:56:10,994 --> 01:56:14,076
We covered up the Vegas scam
to protect her.

1423
01:56:14,620 --> 01:56:16,944
That's what I thought
we did for our women.

1424
01:56:17,038 --> 01:56:19,408
How can that be a sin
against honour?

1425
01:56:19,788 --> 01:56:22,787
She is a hitter and a thief.

1426
01:56:23,290 --> 01:56:25,529
You must give her to us.

1427
01:56:25,790 --> 01:56:27,663
What is your answer?

1428
01:57:01,716 --> 01:57:03,257
The family.

1429
01:57:04,342 --> 01:57:07,257
It's the only place I can be,
I know that.

1430
01:57:23,805 --> 01:57:27,303
It's business Charley, only business.

1431
01:57:49,604 --> 01:57:51,726
Irene?
Charley.

1432
01:57:53,022 --> 01:57:54,016
Hello.

1433
01:57:54,897 --> 01:57:56,390
Everything is ok.

1434
01:57:56,606 --> 01:57:58,977
The Don's gonna give you
your money back.

1435
01:57:59,106 --> 01:58:01,561
All 900 dollars, I got it right here.

1436
01:58:01,733 --> 01:58:03,641
The Don's giving money back?

1437
01:58:03,817 --> 01:58:04,847
Since when?

1438
01:58:04,983 --> 01:58:08,350
Yeah you could have knocked me
over.

1439
01:58:08,610 --> 01:58:10,019
That ain't all.

1440
01:58:10,276 --> 01:58:13,726
He's gonna pay you every dime
for Filargi's stand...

1441
01:58:15,027 --> 01:58:16,936
and what Dominic set.

1442
01:58:17,612 --> 01:58:19,189
How about that?

1443
01:58:19,321 --> 01:58:20,944
Oh, Charley!

1444
01:58:22,613 --> 01:58:23,775
Well...

1445
01:58:24,864 --> 01:58:26,819
I'm glad
everything is settled.

1446
01:58:28,782 --> 01:58:29,777
I just...

1447
01:58:30,907 --> 01:58:36,692
wanted you to know that
everything is a hundred percent ok.

1448
01:58:40,910 --> 01:58:45,652
Oh Marxie,
I should have listened.

1449
01:59:29,339 --> 01:59:33,797
After you take this stone out
of my shoe...

1450
01:59:34,757 --> 01:59:36,963
you call your father...

1451
01:59:37,092 --> 01:59:39,663
and tell him where he can get her.

1452
01:59:39,967 --> 01:59:43,334
And then the wind will stop blowing.

1453
01:59:44,094 --> 01:59:45,207
Charley...

1454
01:59:45,594 --> 01:59:47,918
you got 900,000 here.

1455
02:00:05,682 --> 02:00:09,298
What's the first flight out of L.A. To
Hong Kong in the morning?

1456
02:00:11,434 --> 02:00:14,303
Flight 009 at 10.45 am.

1457
02:00:14,435 --> 02:00:16,591
But we can get you to Hong Kong
tonight out of LA.

1458
02:00:16,727 --> 02:00:18,849
Oh no thank you I have to go
to the bank in the morning.

1459
02:00:18,978 --> 02:00:23,269
Reserve 009 then one seat, first class.
The name is Hilary Jackson.

1460
02:00:23,979 --> 02:00:25,638
Mrs. Hilary Jackson.

1461
02:01:12,284 --> 02:01:13,694
Irene?

1462
02:01:24,705 --> 02:01:26,078
Irene?

1463
02:02:21,261 --> 02:02:22,671
Irene?

1464
02:02:25,054 --> 02:02:26,333
Irene?

1465
02:02:26,679 --> 02:02:28,421
Look who's here.

1466
02:02:33,472 --> 02:02:37,384
Charley!
What a wonderful surprise!

1467
02:02:37,516 --> 02:02:39,471
Baby I got three whole days.

1468
02:02:39,599 --> 02:02:41,674
We can do anything you want.
You name it.

1469
02:02:45,017 --> 02:02:47,222
Baby we are gonna have a ball.

1470
02:03:20,903 --> 02:03:24,185
Jesus, what a beautiful song.

1471
02:03:25,946 --> 02:03:27,936
Why don't you go
and warm up the bed?

1472
02:03:28,071 --> 02:03:29,066
I'll be right there.

1473
02:03:31,655 --> 02:03:32,899
Yeah!

1474
02:05:33,771 --> 02:05:34,850
Mae?

1475
02:05:35,147 --> 02:05:36,426
Charley.

1476
02:05:36,522 --> 02:05:37,802
Charley, you know what?

1477
02:05:37,898 --> 02:05:41,809
My sister Theresa just got back
today from her honeymoon.

1478
02:05:42,816 --> 02:05:45,055
Where did they go?
Outer space?

1479
02:05:48,442 --> 02:05:49,851
What do you say...

1480
02:05:50,567 --> 02:05:52,938
we go to dinner tonight?

1481
02:05:53,194 --> 02:05:54,355
Dinner?

1482
02:05:56,986 --> 02:05:58,776
What do you mean?

1483
02:05:59,112 --> 02:06:00,106
What do I mean?

1484
02:06:00,237 --> 02:06:03,070
I mean let's go some place
and get something to eat.

1485
02:06:03,488 --> 02:06:05,028
You, me and Irene?

1486
02:06:05,113 --> 02:06:06,108
No.

1487
02:06:07,781 --> 02:06:09,155
Just you and me.

1488
02:06:09,906 --> 02:06:11,364
What about Irene?

1489
02:06:13,074 --> 02:06:16,522
She had to go away.
She won't be back.

1490
02:06:19,909 --> 02:06:21,106
How about it?

1491
02:06:21,201 --> 02:06:22,196
How about?

1492
02:06:22,993 --> 02:06:26,655
Holy cow, Charley.
Just tell me where you want to meet.
