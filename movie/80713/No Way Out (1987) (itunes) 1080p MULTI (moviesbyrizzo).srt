1
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,960
No more.

2
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,906
Is that... Is that
supposed to scare me?

3
00:04:01,941 --> 00:04:03,241
Don't be a wiseass!

4
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:05,610
Just take it easy.

5
00:04:05,645 --> 00:04:08,146
Commander Farrell's
trying to lay it
out for us.

6
00:04:08,181 --> 00:04:11,116
So why don't you two
guys just knock it off?

7
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,986
How did you actually meet
the Secretary of Defense?

8
00:04:18,124 --> 00:04:20,925
I was introduced
to him by Pritchard.

9
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,927
I met him when
I was in college.

10
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:25,430
Pritchard?
Yeah, Scott Pritchard!

11
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:27,499
Jesus.

12
00:04:27,534 --> 00:04:29,734
General Counsel for
the Secretary of Defense.

13
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:32,671
You got it?
Is that good enough?
Look, you know this already.

14
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,984
When's he gonna come
out from behind here?

15
00:04:46,986 --> 00:04:48,953
Uh, yes, sir.

16
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,756
<i>Got it?</i>

17
00:04:55,562 --> 00:04:57,595
Good evening, sir.

18
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,199
Get that
limo out of here.

19
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,334
Hi.

20
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,802
Move that car.

21
00:05:13,747 --> 00:05:15,213
Thank you.

22
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:27,526
Lucky that's
not a bullshit detector or
else none of us would get in.

23
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:44,809
How are you, Scott?

24
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,044
Hi, Tom.
How are you?

25
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:47,212
Fine.
You look great.

26
00:05:47,247 --> 00:05:48,346
Thank you.
Thank you.

27
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,748
And thank you
for the invitation.

28
00:05:49,783 --> 00:05:52,384
I'm not used to hanging
out in places like this.

29
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:54,652
But I suspect
you'd like to.

30
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,654
I take it
you'd like to
join our staff.

31
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,724
That was the purpose
of the note, wasn't it?

32
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,160
Well, it wasn't a note.
It was a Christmas card.

33
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:05,430
And as I recall,
the message was,
"Merry Christmas."

34
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:07,399
Yes. Thank you very much.

35
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,034
David, Scott is here.

36
00:06:10,069 --> 00:06:13,038
Come on. I want to
introduce you to someone.

37
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:16,841
Hello.
Scott,
how nice to see you.

38
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,510
Nice to see you.

39
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,611
Thank you.

40
00:06:19,646 --> 00:06:21,246
Scott, how are you?
Hello.

41
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:23,181
Secretary Brice,
this is Commander Farrell,

42
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,616
the officer
I mentioned?

43
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,884
If you recall,
he's had experience

44
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,952
on the Joint Staff
and Naval Intelligence.

45
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,687
Pleased to meet you, sir.

46
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,557
Everyone I know is
looking forward to serving
under you for another term.

47
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:34,626
You must have very
limited acquaintanceship.

48
00:06:34,661 --> 00:06:36,861
Tom and I were
at college together.

49
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:38,130
Good.

50
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,299
He has great warmth.

51
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:44,536
He's a genius.
Oh?

52
00:06:44,571 --> 00:06:47,405
The normal rules
don't apply.

53
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,509
You know,
some people think
you're really the brains.

54
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:52,944
Do they?

55
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,915
Is that
supposed to
flatter me?

56
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,451
He's the most
extraordinary person
I've ever met in my life.

57
00:06:59,486 --> 00:07:02,454
If it came to it, I'd
lay down my life for him.

58
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,022
Is that a job requirement?

59
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,519
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>it certainly was fantastic</i>

60
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,521
<i>having the President</i>
<i>here this evening.</i>

61
00:07:36,556 --> 00:07:39,491
<i>And I'm sure you'll all agree</i>
<i>that we can look forward to</i>
<i>a fine four years.</i>

62
00:07:39,526 --> 00:07:43,328
<i>So let's continue to keep</i>
<i>our inaugural hair down</i>
<i>with some more music.</i>

63
00:07:43,363 --> 00:07:46,364
<i>Let's do it right now.</i>
<i>All right? Come on.</i>

64
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,700
<i>Yeah. All right.</i>

65
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:55,139
<i>¶ They're twistin'</i>
<i>in Washington</i>

66
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,675
<i>¶ At the inaugural ball</i>

67
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:01,145
<i>¶ On K street</i>
<i>On M street</i>

68
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,715
<i>¶ All around the mall</i>

69

<i>¶ They're twistin'</i>
<i>They're twistin'</i>

70
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,787
<i>¶ Twistin' one and all</i>

<i>¶ We're shakin'</i>
<i>We're movin'</i>

72
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:14,526
<i>¶ Turning loose tonight ¶</i>

73
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:16,194
Excuse me.
Do you have a light?

74
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:23,368
If you want to look down
my dress, you should
grow a few inches.

75
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,374
Wanna dance?

76
00:08:29,409 --> 00:08:31,543
The twist?
No, thank you.

77
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,746
Well, we don't have to twist.

78
00:08:34,781 --> 00:08:36,180
"No" meant no.

79
00:08:36,215 --> 00:08:37,749
So, "No" wasn't
a figure of speech?

80
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:38,983
No.

81
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,754
You're pretty
impressed with me.

82
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,022
No.

83
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,691
Yes, you are.

84
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,399
Stoli, straight up.

85
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:01,005
So I was impressed.

86
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,173
Yeah. Want a drink?

87
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,374
Same.

88
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,742
Make it two.

89
00:09:04,777 --> 00:09:06,010
<i>All right, ladies,</i>
<i>do you think I'm sexy?</i>

90
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,612
You one of them?

91
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:09,781
<i>No, no, I can't</i>
<i>hear you. I said...</i>
One of who?

92
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:11,749
<i>"Do you think I'm sexy?"</i>
These hypocrites,
all fat and shiny.

93
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:14,552
Gearing up for another
four years of ramming
it to the rest of us.

94
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:15,687
Are you one of them?

95
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,221
No.

96
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,690
I'll bet you are.

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,661
You're pretty cynical.

98
00:09:23,496 --> 00:09:25,597
Adequate to the occasion.

99
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:31,202
<i>¶ He's acting shy</i>
<i>Looking for an answer</i>

100
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:34,706
We have
a potential nausea
situation building here.

101
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,743
<i>¶ Now hold on a minute</i>
<i>Before we go much further ¶</i>

102
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:41,079
Let's get out of here.

103
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,081
My date's not gonna
like that much.

104
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,283
But what the hell.

105
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,320
His wife
will be delighted.

106
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:52,090
Is this something
we should talk about?

107
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,093
Nope.

108
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,799
Where would
you like to go?

109
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,535
Show us the monuments.

110
00:10:13,813 --> 00:10:17,315
<i>¶ When I looked in your eyes</i>

111
00:10:18,851 --> 00:10:22,220
<i>¶ I could see us together</i>

112
00:10:26,492 --> 00:10:29,227
<i>¶ Now I find myself here</i>

113
00:10:31,731 --> 00:10:34,799
<i>¶ Just wondering whether</i>

114
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,540
<i>¶ I should turn back</i>

115
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:47,545
<i>¶ And admit that this is wrong</i>

116
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:53,752
<i>¶ And go back where I belong</i>

117

119

00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,140
What's your name?

121
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,242
Bill.

122
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,878
How you doing, Bill?
You wanna shut the slide?

123
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:23,081
Uh, sure.

124
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,716

I'm Susan.

135
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,041
We're here.

136
00:13:01,047 --> 00:13:02,580
Is this your apartment?

137
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,183
No, no.
I have a key
to my apartment.

138
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,851
It better be good.

139

Nina, Tom.
Tom, Nina.

141

There's
a limousine
downstairs, okay?

142
00:13:11,858 --> 00:13:14,492
There's booze in my pantry,
the refrigerator's
full of food.

143
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:16,460
No, Susan. Susan!

144
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,162
Why don't you go
to your own place?

145
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,833
Because it's just one
of those things, okay?
Be a friend, all right?

146
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,302
If anybody calls, then
just tell them that I died

147
00:13:24,337 --> 00:13:26,704
or that I'm asleep,
all right?

148
00:13:26,739 --> 00:13:28,873
He won't call, all right?
I'll think of something.

149
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,875
Here are the keys
to my apartment.
I gotta change.

150
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,878
No, no, everything you need
is in the back seat
of the car, okay?

151
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,479
You didn't do it.

Hey, now,
you better beat it
before I get arrested.

Oh, nice meeting you, Tom.

Nice to meet you, Nina.

00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:48,726
Move it.

157
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:53,631
Get it out of here.

00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:55,066
Okay, asshole.

00:13:57,103 --> 00:14:00,037
I gotta make a living.
Huh? Can we move it along?

161
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,875
The white zone is for loading
and unloading passengers only.
No parking.

162
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:20,091
Take care of yourself.

163
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:23,995
Send postcards from
exotic ports of call.

164
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:26,898
That's what you
call them, isn't it?
"Exotic ports of call."

165
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,800
A port's a port.

166
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,936
You're exotic.

167
00:14:37,109 --> 00:14:38,309
Bye.

168
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,919
Gate 47.

169
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,778
Morning, Tommy.
It's a little bit early
to be relieving me.

170
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:17,581
Well, I felt
our motion change.

171
00:15:17,616 --> 00:15:20,151
Have we
set a forward
lookout in this?

172
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:23,587
Yeah. Standing orders.

173
00:15:23,622 --> 00:15:26,557
Maybe you should
inform the captain that
the foredeck's shipping water.

174
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,960
Right. Do you wanna be
the one to wake him up?

175
00:15:28,995 --> 00:15:30,828
The fleet radioed we got
a Russian sub out there.

176
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,964
We're supposed to
catch up and stay with it.

177
00:15:34,467 --> 00:15:36,634
Great.

178
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:38,736
Give us a chance to
try out the depth charges.

179
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,171
Yeah, that'll be the day.

180
00:15:40,206 --> 00:15:42,773
Uh-huh.
The last one.

181
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,409
Forward watch is down!
Forward watch is down, sir!

182
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:48,012
Forward watch is down!
He's gonna be swept over, sir!

183
00:15:52,018 --> 00:15:53,784
Get the spot on him.
Aye, sir.

184
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:55,519
Where is he?
There he is! There!

185
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:57,588
Hold on!

186
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,657
Has he got
a safety line on?

187
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:01,793
Tommy!

188
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,462
Scramble a rescue party now!

189
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,368
Help!

190
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:13,771
<i>Send the</i>
<i>special rescue detail.</i>
<i>Forward lookout down.</i>

191
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:16,040
Tommy, come back!
Wait for the rescue party!

192
00:16:16,075 --> 00:16:19,043
<i>Send the</i>
<i>special rescue detail.</i>
<i>Forward lookout down.</i>

193
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:20,211
Shit.

194
00:16:20,246 --> 00:16:22,680
Help me!

195
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:25,016
Tommy, you don't
have a safety line on!

196
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:27,785
Keep the light on him.

197
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,420
I'm trying, sir!

198
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:51,743
Tommy!

199
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:00,251
Keep the light on him!

200
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:01,685
It's too windy, sir!

201
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,221
Hold on!

202
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,424
Don't let him out
of your sight. Jesus!

203
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:38,156
Hurry!

204
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,297
Oh, God, help!

205
00:17:46,332 --> 00:17:48,132
He's got him.
He's got him!

206
00:17:49,301 --> 00:17:51,235
We got him! Whoo!

207
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:18,496
You've seen the leak
on the budget cuts?

208
00:18:18,531 --> 00:18:20,598
I've read the papers.
You're late.

209
00:18:20,633 --> 00:18:22,233
I was caught in traffic.

210
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:24,001
You should allow for that.
I do.

211
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:28,005
I've redlined the relevant
sections and my synopsis
is at the end.

212
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,573
Order breakfast.

213
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,808
It's the
most important
meal of the day.

214
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:32,810
You should take
better care of yourself.

215
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,578
Menu, sir.

216
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,280
Five years.
Two billion dollars.

217
00:18:36,315 --> 00:18:40,017
Gulf Maritime can't even
get the prototype to float.

218
00:18:40,052 --> 00:18:42,987
The Phantom Sub is a sinkhole.

219
00:18:43,022 --> 00:18:44,822
I'm not putting
another dime into it.

220
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:48,626
You're right, of course.
But what about the Armed
Services Committee? Duvall?

221
00:18:48,661 --> 00:18:51,128
One thing
I'm looking forward to
in this next four years

222
00:18:51,163 --> 00:18:53,197
is putting that
fraud Duvall in
his place.

223
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:57,635
He's right back there.

224
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,037
I know. Let's go.

225
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,377
Oh, hi.

226
00:19:06,412 --> 00:19:08,779
Mr. Secretary Brice.
Good morning, sir.

227
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,314
Senator, how are you?

228
00:19:10,349 --> 00:19:11,715
Mr. Marshall.
Mr. Secretary.

229
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,218
We've been having a little
discussion here about that

230
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:16,620
piece on the
budget in the paper.
Did you read it, sir?

231
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,023
No, I haven't
read the papers.
Scott was mentioning it.

232
00:19:19,058 --> 00:19:21,192
Ah! Mr. Pritchard.

233
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:24,461
Where in heaven's name do
they get their information?

234
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,665
And that idea
about cutting back
on the Phantom Sub?

235
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,800
It's essentially groundless.

236
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,069
As a matter of fact, we were
just going over our options
on that.

237
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:34,638
Talking to Mr. Marshall
here, he tells me those
Soviets are doing things

238
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,640
with submarines that
will turn your hair white.

239
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,810
Senator, you
can rest assured.
I have no intention

240
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,180
of making a decision on this
without consulting you first.

241
00:19:43,215 --> 00:19:45,049
Good day.

242
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:47,051
Good day, Senator.

243
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,091
You believe that?

244
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,093
No.

245
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,098
The car, please.

246
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,068
That business
with Marshall.

247
00:20:04,103 --> 00:20:06,437
He was telling us that if
we fight him, he'll have
the CIA on his side.

248
00:20:06,472 --> 00:20:10,074
Well, of course,
he pushed Marshall
for the directorship.

249
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,276
Scott, I'm sorry.
Sometimes I'm short
with you. I apologize.

250
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:14,245
Well, that's
not necessary.

251
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,213
You know, several months ago,
you introduced me to
a friend of yours.

252
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:18,115
An officer. Uh...

253
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,283
Commander Farrell?

254
00:20:19,318 --> 00:20:21,585
Right. I understand
he has a background
in Intelligence.

255
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,520
He has two tours
with Naval Intelligence.

256
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:26,390
We could use a hero.
Get him here, will you?

257
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:29,293
His ship's in Manila.

258
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,661
Just do it, please.

259
00:20:32,498 --> 00:20:34,531
No, no, no.
You want...

260
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,067
Come on.
Come here,
you want a real hero.

261
00:20:37,102 --> 00:20:39,403
You know. You know
you want to do it.

262
00:20:39,438 --> 00:20:42,306
Come on.
<i>Arriba! Arriba!</i>

263
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:44,308
Gates, try to remember
you're an officer. Please.

264
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,310
You're making it
hard on me, Tommy.
You're making it hard on me.

265
00:20:46,345 --> 00:20:47,478
They're gonna
be there all day.

266
00:20:47,513 --> 00:20:49,546
No,
you know what I'm
talking about, man.

267
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,315
What's that?
You deserve the damn medal.

268
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,916
I carry?

269
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:54,285
If you jump me
for promotion,
I'll kill you.

270
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,253
I carry.
I'll kill your family.
I'll kill your pig.

271
00:20:56,288 --> 00:20:58,322
What? You carry me?
I carry.

272
00:20:58,357 --> 00:20:59,923
You carry my bag?
No, I speak Filipino.

273
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,292
Beat it, kid.
Come on, beat it.

274
00:21:01,327 --> 00:21:03,160
No, he's gotta
make a living,
but don't run.

275
00:21:03,195 --> 00:21:04,428
He's gonna run.

276
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:06,930
If you run, I knock
dog's doo-doo out of you.

277
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,932
He's running!

278
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:12,336
Kid!

279
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:14,338
John, forget it!

280
00:21:16,342 --> 00:21:18,509
No, let him go.
Let him go. Let him go.

281
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,743
Let him go. So what?

282
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,413
He's got a toothbrush,
a pair of skivvies.
So what?

283
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,316
Okay.
So what do we do now?

284
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:28,485
I don't know. I thought
I'd go buy some ashtrays

285
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,089
and take in some of
the local folk dancing.

286
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,924
Folk dancing?
Yeah, folk dancing.

287
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,799
♫ Wild thing

288
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,335
No, person to person.

289
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:45,536
♫ You make my heart sing

290
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:48,806
You know,
when you only pay if
you talk to the person?

291
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,374
♫ You make everything
Shut up! Just shut up!

292
00:21:50,409 --> 00:21:52,876
No, not you.
♫ Groovy!

293
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:56,113
No, I will pay.
But first, I have
to know if she's there.

294
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:59,350
One, two, three! Yeah!

295
00:21:59,385 --> 00:22:02,119
♫ Wild thing
I think I love you ♫
If I'm willing to count out

296
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,989
a million pesos, I need
to know if she's there.

297
00:22:06,024 --> 00:22:07,157
Yeah.

298
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:10,361
Hey, that's my money.
Yes.

299
00:22:10,396 --> 00:22:12,396
That's my money.
Go get it.

300
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:13,731
Go get it.

301
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:19,670
No, no,
I'm not joking.
I'm an American.

302
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:25,809
Hello?

303
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,446
Yes. Connect, I'll take it.
I'm putting my money in now.

304
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,851
<i>Susan? Hello, Susan?</i>

305
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:36,587
Was I just...
Was I just...
Shut up!

306
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:39,656
Was I just disconnected?
Why? Why?

307
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:42,926
I'm gonna show them.
I'm gonna show them how
an American plants the flag

308
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,729
in a foreign fucking land!

309
00:22:45,764 --> 00:22:47,298
Yeah!

310
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:54,004
Can I
get a beer, please?
I'd like another beer.

311
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,439
Wild thing!

312
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,288
You're beautiful.

313
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,473
Hey, thanks.

314
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:31,242
Keep it. Thank you.

315
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,693
Hello, Tom! Welcome back.
I have some mail for you.
Come in. Come in.

316
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:55,599
The Philippines,
a romantic place, huh?

317
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:59,503
I painted a new painting,
<i>Christmas in New England.</i>

318
00:24:01,139 --> 00:24:02,673
It's beautiful.

319
00:24:02,708 --> 00:24:03,874
You really like it?

320
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06,844
Well, it's unfinished.

321
00:24:06,879 --> 00:24:09,346
Will you be
with us for a while?

322
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,916
Yes, I'll be working
in the Pentagon again.

323
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:14,084
Thank you.

324
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,652
Great, wonderful.

325
00:24:15,687 --> 00:24:16,920
It's always
a pleasure to
have you back.

326
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,724
Oh, my God.

327
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,694
Hello.

328
00:24:24,897 --> 00:24:26,763
The ancient mariner.

329
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,732
Not so ancient, mmm?

330
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:35,906
Ah! I'm wasted!

331
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:38,576
I can see that.

332
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,947
Wow, I'm so happy to see you!

333
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,849
When did you get back?
And why didn't you call me?

334
00:24:45,884 --> 00:24:46,950
I did call you.

335
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,719
I wrote you.
You did?

336
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:52,556
Uh-huh.
But I'm like semiliterate,
so it was wastebasket time.

337
00:24:52,591 --> 00:24:54,558
If you caught gonorrhea,
I'll kill you.

338
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,570
I'm wearing
too many clothes.

339
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,739
It doesn't feel like
you're wearing anything.

340
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:11,375
Talk about feeling like
it's not wearing anything.

341
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,747
Oh. Oh, you're gonna blush.

342
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,582
You are a very bad girl.

343
00:25:18,617 --> 00:25:21,685
Hold it.
I mean the blush.

344
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,623
I'm so embarrassed.

345
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,692
What are you doing?

346
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:30,694
I wanna get
a picture of this.
No! No pictures.

347
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,597
Naval hero blushes.
Come on, Farrell.
You're proud.

348
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:37,534
No, I'm not proud.
I'm serious.

349
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:39,770
Don't take a picture
of me, please.

350
00:25:39,805 --> 00:25:41,605
Come on.

351
00:25:42,574 --> 00:25:43,840
Give me that.

352
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,442
You jiggled the camera.

353
00:25:46,612 --> 00:25:48,212
You pervert.

354
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:54,952
Oh.

355
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,624
I think
I did this
way too early.

356
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,961
It looks like a baboon
in a closet at midnight.

357
00:26:40,298 --> 00:26:42,299
Good morning, Mr. Pritchard.
Go right in.

358
00:26:42,334 --> 00:26:43,467
May I take your hat,
sir?

359
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,135
Oh, thank you.

360
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:51,775
Commander.

361
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,277
Glad to have you with us.

362
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,413
It's nice
to be here.
Thank you, sir.

363
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,849
Scott has a very
high opinion of you.

364
00:26:58,884 --> 00:27:00,450
Are you familiar
with your new duties?

365
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:03,253
No, sir.

366
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,656
Well, then,
this meeting is
premature, isn't it?

367
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:08,492
Tom only arrived in
Washington yesterday, sir.

368
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,661
Well, since you're here.

369
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:13,130
As my assistant,
you'll function
as liaison

370
00:27:13,165 --> 00:27:16,867
under Scott's supervision
between this office and
the Intelligence community.

371
00:27:18,904 --> 00:27:22,706
Calling that collection
of piranhas a community
is one of life's ironies.

372
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,709
You'll meet regularly
with a representative
from each of the agencies.

373
00:27:25,744 --> 00:27:29,713
But, for now,
I am primarily
concerned with the CIA.

374
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:30,947
Sir?

375
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,883
Are you aware of
the Phantom Submarine?

376
00:27:32,918 --> 00:27:34,017
Yes, sir.

377
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:36,019
Have a seat.

378
00:27:36,054 --> 00:27:37,954
Thank you.

379
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,657
The Phantom Submarine is
supposed to be invisible
to sonar.

380
00:27:40,692 --> 00:27:42,693
Naturally,
the builder's
first instinct...

381
00:27:42,728 --> 00:27:44,895
Well, I should say
his second instinct.

382
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:49,299
His first being to get his
snout as deeply as possible
into the public trough.

383
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:54,871
Anyway, they want to build
a submarine roughly the
size of an aircraft carrier.

384
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:56,740
Well,
the Russians won't
need sonar to find it.

385
00:27:56,775 --> 00:27:59,710
They'll just see this
huge bulge out in the
ocean.

386
00:27:59,745 --> 00:28:02,045
It's my plan to
terminate this program.

387
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,915
There's
gonna be considerable
Congressional resistance,

388
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:05,916
principally
from Senator Duvall.

389
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:08,485
Excuse me. Scott.

390
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,755
What's worrying is
his connection to
the CIA.

391
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,758
We can expect them to feed
him with inflated estimates

392
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,160
of Soviet research
in the field.

393
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,763
And in order to counter him,
we'll have to have access
to the same information.

394
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,398
And not some
self-serving gloss,

395
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:23,767
but the
raw data that they
base their conclusions on.

396
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:25,202
Your job is to get it.

397
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:26,503
Yes, sir.

398
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:28,572
But raw data
from the CIA...

399
00:28:28,607 --> 00:28:29,940
My experience with ONI...

400
00:28:29,975 --> 00:28:32,008
They'll either give
it to us or they won't.

401
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,910
If they do, it'll
prove I'm correct.

402
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:37,547
If they do not, I will use
that fact against them
with the President.

403
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,516
You realize, of course,
I'm speaking
in complete candor.

404
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,384
Yes, sir.

405
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:42,986
Senator Duvall.

406
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:49,726
Senator Duvall
is motivated by this
absurd lust. Sit down.

407
00:28:49,761 --> 00:28:51,795
This absurd
lust for power.

408
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,232
Now,
this would be comic if
it wasn't so damn dangerous.

409
00:28:55,267 --> 00:29:00,570
Marshall
at the CIA
is his creature.

410
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:02,305
You,
as a career officer,

411
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:04,107
are above this kind of
political unpleasantness,

412
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:05,976
and that's why I chose you.
Yes, sir.

413
00:29:06,011 --> 00:29:07,611
Now,
you go with Scott
and acquaint yourself

414
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,379
with the background material.
Yes, sir.

415
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,047
Commander,
let's cut the protocol.

416
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,649
In the absence
of a demurral,

417
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:15,352
I'll assume
all your responses
are in the affirmative.

418
00:29:17,823 --> 00:29:19,957
Lorraine, get my wife
on the phone, please.

419
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,094
I think he likes you.

420
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:29,800
Okay, this is
the situation room.

421
00:29:29,835 --> 00:29:32,469
And right this way, sir,
is the computer center.

422
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:39,276
Did I mention, sir,
that I am very pleased
to be working for you?

423
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:42,846
This is a Sperry 90/80
and all the terminals
in this room are for it.

424
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:46,283
It interfaces
with the IBM 370s at NSA
headquarters in Fort Meade.

425
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:48,819
Principally, it works
programs for COMSEC,
SIGINT,

426
00:29:48,854 --> 00:29:51,855
the Personnel Command,
the Bureau of Alcohol
and Fire...

427
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,690
I get...
I get your gist.

428
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,458
Oh, that's Dr. Hesselman,
the systems analyst.
Let me introduce...

429
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:57,460
I know
who it is.
Sam Hesselman.

430
00:29:57,495 --> 00:29:59,629
Tom, it's good to see you.

431
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:01,665
Why didn't you call me
when you got into town?

432
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,734
I don't know.
Why didn't we call?

433
00:30:04,069 --> 00:30:05,635
Sir?

434
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,272
It's good to see you, Tom.
You look great.

435
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,308
Come on in the office.

436
00:30:11,343 --> 00:30:13,376
Mr. Fox, take a break.
Yes, sir.

437
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:14,878
Are you back here,
I mean, for good?

438
00:30:14,913 --> 00:30:16,880
I don't know about "for good,"
but I'm stationed here again.

439
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,048
How the hell are you?

440
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,716
Can't complain.

441
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:21,318
Helen
and the kids
asked about you.

442
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,452
Good.
Yeah.

443
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:24,454
The kids
loved the ashtray.

444
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:26,890
They didn't know
a donkey could
do that.

445
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:29,893
Come on.

446
00:30:34,933 --> 00:30:38,068
Tom, this is
Kevin O'Brien.
Howdy.

447
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:41,304
CIA.
I've explained that
you're taking over liaison.

448
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:43,707
Hi there.
Kevin will be your contact.

449
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:45,842
It's good to meet you,
Farrell.

450
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:47,477
If there's anything
I can do to help you
settle in, let me know.

451
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,846
Well, right now I'm just
getting my feet wet,
trying to catch up.

452
00:30:49,881 --> 00:30:51,882
Oh?

453
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,150
I assumed that because
you didn't want to wait
until the regular meeting...

454
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,486
Well, I'm certain that
there are some questions

455
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,988
that Commander Farrell
must have.

456
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,991
No. I'm not sufficiently
prepared to ask anything.

457
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:03,226
I wouldn't want
to waste your time.

458
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,929
Well,
then, gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me.

459
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,998
You know, maybe there
is one thing, Kevin.
I...

460
00:31:08,033 --> 00:31:11,501
The Secretary has asked me
to help him prepare for
the NATO meeting,

461
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,236
and I'd like to
familiarize myself

462
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,105
with Russian
Intelligence estimates.

463
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,041
We submit a report
on the first of the month.

464
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:21,912
It'd be a big help if you
could send what you have
as of now.

465
00:31:21,947 --> 00:31:24,014
Sure, I'll have them put
something together for you.

466
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,248
Thanks.
I'd appreciate
it very much.

467
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:26,984
Oh, don't mention it.

468
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:35,125
That was deftly handled.

469
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,093
For a moment there,
I thought...

470
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,029
Just trying
to be subtle.

471
00:31:39,064 --> 00:31:40,764
That's my job, isn't it?

472
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,132
Hmm.

473
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,420
What is this?
A present?

474
00:32:03,455 --> 00:32:04,621
Yeah.

475
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,123
He gave it to me.
He did?

476
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:10,160
He has expensive
taste. This guy.

477
00:32:10,195 --> 00:32:12,963
Didn't cost anything.

478
00:32:12,998 --> 00:32:16,099
Some foreign minister
gave it to him.

479
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:19,069
So, in other words,
we're dealing here
with a guy

480
00:32:19,104 --> 00:32:21,972
foreign ministers
give presents to?

481
00:32:22,007 --> 00:32:23,807
Don't start that stuff.

482
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:26,009
I didn't say anything.

483
00:32:26,044 --> 00:32:28,745
Well, you don't
have to say anything.

484
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,480
You never say a word.

485
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,617
Well, I thought
I wasn't supposed to.

486
00:32:34,652 --> 00:32:36,252
You know what I mean.

487
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,656
You get that wounded,
disapproving look
on your face.

488
00:32:42,027 --> 00:32:44,561
Ask me a question,
I'll answer it.

489
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,037
It's David Brice,
Secretary of Defense.

490
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,472
Satisfied?

491
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,480
You know I work for Brice?

492
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:07,017
Then that makes two of us.

493
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:11,121
Did you take care
of everything?

494
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:14,224
Yes.
I'm supposed to pick
Miss Atwell up at 8:00,

495
00:33:14,259 --> 00:33:16,559
if she remembers.

496
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,028
You don't approve
of Susan, do you?

497
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:21,131
Sir?

498
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:23,566
She's a very
bright and exciting woman.
Can't you understand that?

499
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,335
Not exactly, I guess.

500
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,807
All right.
I'm a pain in the ass.

501
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:34,044
But this one can
do things for me like no
other woman I've ever met.

502
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:40,083
It's the only other
thing worth living for.

503
00:33:44,722 --> 00:33:47,157
Goddamn, what is
the big deal about tonight?

504
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,526
He likes to
see me in public.

505
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,095
So what
does he get?
A secret hard-on?

506
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,433
Try and understand.
I'll call you later tonight.

507
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:58,135
I'll wait by the phone.

508
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,377
Hello, Scott.
Hello, Miss Atwell.

509
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,291
Two white wines, please.

510
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:57,327
Mr. Brice.

511
00:34:57,362 --> 00:35:02,332
Mr. Marshall and I have been
having a little debate on
government service.

512
00:35:02,367 --> 00:35:06,169
Now, I claim
that the fellow
with the appointed job,

513
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:11,674
well, he sort of comes and
he goes at the pleasure of
this or that administration.

514
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:14,010
He sort of
blows in the wind.

515
00:35:14,045 --> 00:35:16,479
Whereas the elected
official,

516
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:19,582
well, he serves
the people directly.

517
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,585
He has to be
more responsible.

518
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,021
What do you think,
Mr. Secretary?

519
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,225
Senator Duvall, I think
it is getting very late.

520
00:35:35,233 --> 00:35:37,367
Oh, yes. Thanks.

521
00:35:37,402 --> 00:35:38,635
Thank you.

522
00:35:47,312 --> 00:35:49,512
Who's that man
licking Duvall's ear?

523
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,147
I recognize him.

524
00:35:51,182 --> 00:35:52,182
I would hope so.

525
00:35:52,217 --> 00:35:55,351
That's Marshall.
He's the director of the CIA.

526
00:35:55,386 --> 00:35:57,187
Mmm. You would hope so.

527
00:36:07,432 --> 00:36:09,065
No, thank you.

528
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,848
Commander.
So nice you
could make it.

529
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:27,250
Thank you, sir.

530
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:41,264
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

531
00:36:41,299 --> 00:36:45,401
It's very good
of you to come and help us
celebrate our National Day.

532
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:49,105
After all,
we're a small
country, far away.

533
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,341
We've got a little
entertainment for
you this evening,

534
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,676
which I'm sure
you're going to enjoy.

535
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,287
I'll be right back.

536
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,490
Hi.
Hi.

537
00:37:41,492 --> 00:37:42,525
You're going away?

538
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,328
Just for the weekend.

539
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:47,664
Perhaps
a romantic
interlude, yes?

540
00:37:48,366 --> 00:37:50,333
Perhaps.

541
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:53,303
If I intrude
on your privacy
for this, I am sorry.

542
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:57,173
It's not just a job,
it's an adventure.

543
00:37:58,376 --> 00:38:00,543
<i>♫ Won't you say it</i>

544
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:06,449

548
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,498
What are you eating?
You're eating bugs?

549
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,300
I gotta have another one.

550
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,936
Oh! Ew!

551
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:27,971
Here you go.

552
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:31,541
That is really disgusting.

00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:42,585
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!

556
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:44,987
Hold on.

557
00:38:58,269 --> 00:39:00,036
Oh!

558
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,504
Thank you.

559
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:13,349
Well, thank you
very much, sir.

560
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,550
I want you to take
care of us, okay?

561
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:16,386
I will.
You guys newlyweds?

562
00:39:16,421 --> 00:39:18,388
You can go.
Thank you.

563
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:22,825
You're beautiful.

564
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,427
Mr. and Mrs. Smith?

565
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,428
A romantic gesture.

566
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:29,932
How very original.

567
00:39:29,967 --> 00:39:32,202
I spelled it with a "Y."

568
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:44,881
Hi.
Hey, there.

569
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:48,318
We want to rent a boat.

570
00:39:49,454 --> 00:39:51,587
Twenty bucks an hour.
Take your pick.

571
00:39:51,622 --> 00:39:55,425
That's all right, but we
don't want a plastic toy.
We want something like this.

572
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,626
No, no.

573
00:39:56,661 --> 00:39:58,027
Why not?

574
00:39:58,062 --> 00:40:00,763
That's
my boss's boat.
It ain't for rent.

575
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:02,499
Well, I want it.

576
00:40:03,301 --> 00:40:05,435
Don't do this.

577
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:09,405
You're bad.

578
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,773
Listen, do you really
know what you're doing?

579
00:40:10,808 --> 00:40:13,042
I mean, it's gusting like
a son of a bitch out there.

580
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:14,411
One more.

581
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:31,094
God, I wish the Navy
were still like this.

582
00:40:34,532 --> 00:40:36,699
Let's get ready.
We'll come about.

583
00:40:39,537 --> 00:40:40,837
Whoo!

584
00:40:42,507 --> 00:40:45,675
Give me a kiss.
Okay, hold the course.

585
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,311
We're gonna come over here.
Let me get it off.

586
00:40:48,346 --> 00:40:50,146
Ready?
No, not yet.

587
00:40:51,482 --> 00:40:52,482
Okay, whenever you are.

588
00:40:52,517 --> 00:40:54,016
Okay, I'm ready.

589
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,152
Say "Helms alee."
Helms alee!

590
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,454
Very tight.

591
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,695
Yeah.
Yeah!

592
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,935
Hello? Oh, hi, Nina.

593
00:41:47,371 --> 00:41:49,606
Tom and I just
got back this minute.

594
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,244
Okay.

595
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,946
Yeah.

596
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,550
Can I call you later?

597
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,218
Okay.

598
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,022
Bye.

599
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:10,627
Well, it didn't
take him long,
did it?

600
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,597
That was Nina, so don't.

601
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:16,866
Don't what?

602
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:58,574
Oh, no.

603
00:42:58,609 --> 00:43:02,278
Tom. David's here.
Oh, my God.

604
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:07,783
I'm begging you, please.
Just go now out the back door.

605
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,251
I'm sorry. Just...

606
00:43:09,286 --> 00:43:12,221
When I go, it'll be
through the front door.

607
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,625
Oh!
As a favor to me,
just this one time.

608
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:18,461
Please! Please go!

609
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:21,197
I promise I'll work
everything out.
All right?

610
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,767
Tom, please!

611
00:43:24,802 --> 00:43:27,604
Why don't you fucking
go down and beg him
not to come in?

612
00:43:31,709 --> 00:43:34,510
You want me to say it?
I'll say it.

613
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:42,118
Tom? I'll leave him.
I promise I will.
I'll leave him.

614
00:43:43,721 --> 00:43:45,555
I love you.

615
00:44:36,373 --> 00:44:38,341
You've been out of town.

616
00:44:40,945 --> 00:44:43,679
And you have
a pleasant flush.

617
00:44:43,714 --> 00:44:45,481
I got some sun.

618
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:48,084
Oh, how nice.
And with whom did
you get this sun?

619
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:49,351
What?

620
00:44:49,386 --> 00:44:52,988
What?
I said, "Who were
you with this weekend?"

621
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,724
Nobody.

622
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:58,828
Well,
I find that
hard to believe,

623
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:01,697
that you'd go away
completely alone.

624
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:03,766
I didn't say
I was completely alone.

625
00:45:03,801 --> 00:45:06,202
I think you said that
you weren't with anybody.

626
00:45:07,571 --> 00:45:09,939
I mean, nobody you know.

627
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,542
I know a great many people.

628
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,978
How can you be certain
it's somebody I don't know?

629
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,151
You want a drink?

630
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,123
He's a man I know.

631
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:30,827
It's of no importance.

632
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,899
I'm sure
it's of no importance
to you whom you sleep with,

633
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,969
but it's
of considerable
importance to me!

634
00:45:40,004 --> 00:45:42,037
Why worry?
There's plenty left.

635
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,640
Get out
of here, you bastard!

636
00:45:44,675 --> 00:45:47,477
Get out!
I'm calling the
police. Get out!

637
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,613
I wanna know who it was.

638
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:57,953
Listen, God damn it!
I pay the rent here.
No!

639
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,756
Get out of here!

640
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:04,660
All right, wait.
Wait a minute.

641
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,929
I'm sorry I slapped you,
all right?

642
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:08,798
Get out of here.

643
00:46:10,034 --> 00:46:12,668
No! Damn it!
Listen!

644
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,337
You tell me...
No!

645
00:46:15,372 --> 00:46:16,472
You tell me who it is!

646
00:46:16,507 --> 00:46:18,441
He's not a pig like you!

647
00:46:28,953 --> 00:46:30,019
Susan!

648
00:46:46,036 --> 00:46:48,070
David,
what's the matter?

649
00:46:56,247 --> 00:46:58,080
I think I killed Susan.

650
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,185
What happened?

651
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,087
I killed her.

652
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,894
I just needed somebody
to talk to before I go
to the police.

653
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:14,063
Sit down. Sit down.

654
00:47:16,267 --> 00:47:19,635
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to...

655
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:22,872
She was with some man and
I just must've gone crazy.

656
00:47:25,175 --> 00:47:26,876
The man was there?

657
00:47:26,911 --> 00:47:28,778
He saw you?

658
00:47:32,283 --> 00:47:34,116
He saw me go in, yeah.

659
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,086
Who is he?

660
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:40,923
It was dark.

661
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,360
Then maybe
he didn't see you.

662
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,898
I parked my car.
I stood under the light.

663
00:47:50,567 --> 00:47:51,968
He saw me.

664
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:54,370
He saw me.

665
00:48:49,994 --> 00:48:52,094
<i>Hi. I can't come to</i>
<i>the phone right now,</i>

666
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:55,764
<i>but when you</i>
<i>hear the beep,</i>
<i>tell me everything.</i>

667
00:49:12,816 --> 00:49:14,616
Did she ever
photograph you?

668
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,118
No.

669
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,623
This is
the negative
side of a Polaroid.

670
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,192
I found it
under the bed.

671
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:25,194
Are you absolutely certain?

672
00:49:25,229 --> 00:49:27,630
I'm certain.
I'm not that big a fool.

673
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,200
Then we have to
find the man who saw you.

674
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:41,010
What if the
search for this man was
of vital national security?

675
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:44,046
A secret operation
that we could control.

676
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:47,850
It won't hold
up to scrutiny.

677
00:49:47,885 --> 00:49:50,219
We'll invent an excuse for
the search that can be
justified.

678
00:49:50,254 --> 00:49:54,056
The important thing is to
abort an investigation of
Susan's death

679
00:49:54,091 --> 00:49:55,624
before it ever gets to you.

680
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,060
No.
It's a house of cards.

681
00:49:58,095 --> 00:49:59,862
There is no Yuri.

682
00:49:59,897 --> 00:50:01,130
It doesn't matter.

683
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:03,032
All the
Intelligence agencies

684
00:50:03,067 --> 00:50:06,468
believe that
there's a mole in
the Defense Department.

685
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,470
You know the theory.

686
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:12,307
That Yuri was sent here
by the KGB while he was
still in his teens,

687
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,844
and for all intents
and purposes, he can
pass as an American.

688
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:20,049
Scott, they've been talking
about that for four years.
It's the CIA's wet dream.

689
00:50:20,084 --> 00:50:21,250
There's never been
a shred of evidence.

690
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:24,253
Yes, but now there is.

691
00:50:24,288 --> 00:50:28,090
He was
the man who spent
the weekend with Susan.

692
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:30,459
He was the man
who killed her.

693
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:42,104
Lorraine,
will you ask CID to get
all the material on Yuri

694
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,940
and bring it
in to the Secretary
as soon as possible?

695
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,509
Thank you.

696
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:50,112
I don't think
we can bring this off.

697
00:50:50,147 --> 00:50:51,247
You can.

698
00:50:57,588 --> 00:50:59,155
Excuse me.

699
00:51:03,093 --> 00:51:06,061
Good morning, Major.
Morning.

700
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:07,263
Thank you.

701
00:51:11,135 --> 00:51:16,205
If Military Intelligence
can catch this KGB agent
without outside assistance,

702
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:18,107
it will immeasurably
strengthen us against
the CIA.

703
00:51:18,142 --> 00:51:19,441
Thank you.

704
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:22,444
You understand that this
has to move like lightning.

705
00:51:22,479 --> 00:51:24,913
We have to finish
before anyone gets
on to what we're doing.

706
00:51:24,948 --> 00:51:27,316
I want you
to assume control
of the investigation.

707
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:30,252
Responsibility is
consonant with your office.

708
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:33,956
I have
implicit trust in you
to keep this under wraps.

709
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:36,892
You're to report to me
or to Secretary Brice only.

710
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,760
I plan
to remain here
around the clock.

711
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,896
What do the Washington
police know?

712
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,033
They haven't been informed.
CID has taken the body
to Fort Meade.

713
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,338
Well, if we go looking
for a Russian spy
without the FBI

714
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,973
or the CIA in on it,
it's gonna raise hell.

715
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:52,608
That's my problem.

716
00:51:57,181 --> 00:51:59,548
Well,
what do we have
on the dead woman?

717
00:52:01,018 --> 00:52:02,584
It's through
Yuri's association

718
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,154
with this woman that
we'll be able to find him.

719
00:52:05,189 --> 00:52:07,823
Here's
everything we know
about her for the moment.

720
00:52:10,227 --> 00:52:12,961
It looks like he
spent the weekend
with her somewhere.

721
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:16,765
Then he brought her home
and killed her sometime
around midnight.

722
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,069
I'm counting on it not
being too hard to find
out where they'd been.

723
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,045
Tom?

724
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:33,015
Yeah. Yes.

725
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,850
I'm certain
the investigation will
develop more material...

726
00:52:34,885 --> 00:52:36,218
Will you excuse me?

727
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:39,855
Commander Farrell,
are we boring you?

728
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:41,857
No, sir. May I?

729
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,042
Oh.

730
00:53:02,246 --> 00:53:04,680
We can't even convince
our own people, for
Christ's sakes.

731
00:53:04,715 --> 00:53:06,182
It's all right.

732
00:53:40,117 --> 00:53:41,417
Get Donovan in here.

733
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:44,887
Commander, if you please!

734
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:01,303
Commander?

735
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,642
This is Major Donovan
of the Criminal
Investigation Division.

736
00:54:06,677 --> 00:54:09,544
His men will be conducting
the investigation subject
to your orders.

737
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:13,315
Major.
We're set up down in the
situation room, Commander.

738
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:30,866
We have to have
a front man.

739
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,074
They're
autopsying
the body now.

740
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:41,076
I wanna see her apartment.

741
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,477
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

742
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,346
You may not
think it's necessary,
but I want to see it.

743
00:54:44,381 --> 00:54:45,647
They're
autopsying
the body now.

744
00:54:45,682 --> 00:54:47,282
Good.

745
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:49,284
Scott, I wanna see
her apartment firsthand.

746
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,352
Mr. Pritchard...

747
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,520
The CID men will
do a better job.

748
00:54:51,555 --> 00:54:53,455
It's more important
that you remain here.

749
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:56,158
I've got half a dozen men
checking for physical
evidence right now.

750
00:54:56,193 --> 00:54:57,759
The print people
are just back.

751
00:54:57,794 --> 00:54:59,361
What did they find?

752
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:02,964
Oh,
fragments, a smudge.
The place was clean.

753
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:04,966
If you don't
mind my asking,
what's going on?

754
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:07,502
A matter of the
utmost importance.

755
00:55:07,537 --> 00:55:09,204
What is this?

756
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:10,806
We're checking
phone calls made over
the past week

757
00:55:10,841 --> 00:55:12,874
to see if the Atwell
woman's number comes up.

758
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,710
There's gotta be millions.

759
00:55:14,745 --> 00:55:17,179
We interface
with the phone
company's computers.

760
00:55:17,214 --> 00:55:19,981
We're
monitoring every call
made in a 50-mile radius.

761
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:23,618
We're checking gas station,
restaurant and hotel credit
card receipts.

762
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,354
Who is this bimbo anyway?

763
00:55:25,389 --> 00:55:26,822
She's dead.

764
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:30,426
One billfold.

765
00:55:31,595 --> 00:55:33,128
Bracelets.

766
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,196
This is
the evidence
from her house?

767
00:55:34,231 --> 00:55:35,397
Yes, sir.

768
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,600
One box of candy mints.

769
00:55:42,038 --> 00:55:44,006
Got one brown hairbrush.

770
00:55:52,282 --> 00:55:53,849
Commander Farrell
is on his way in,

771
00:55:53,884 --> 00:55:56,518
and we should have a report
on the house-to-house
pretty soon.

772
00:55:56,553 --> 00:55:57,586
What's this?

773
00:55:57,621 --> 00:55:59,288
Polaroid negatives.
Hmm.

774
00:56:01,057 --> 00:56:02,657
I can't make anything out.

775
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,493
If there's still...
Excuse me.

776
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:06,061
If there's
still any silver
left on the emulsion,

777
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:07,662
we may be able to
bring out the picture.

778
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,664
Oh.
Excuse me. Sergeant!

779
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,900
Get this right over
to the photo lab, huh?

780
00:56:13,403 --> 00:56:15,604
Sir? Commander?
Yes?

781
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:18,039
Mr. O'Brien's waiting
for you in your office.

782
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,609
Oh, that's right.
We made an appointment
to go over the CIA report.

783
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:22,411
Mmm. Just cancel it.

784
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:24,546
If we do, he'll
go away suspicious.

785
00:56:25,649 --> 00:56:27,216
That's true.

786
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:35,457
Hello. I'll be in
Commander Farrell's office.

787
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:38,427
<i>Could you call</i>
<i>me in five minutes?</i>

788
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:40,496
Sorry
it took so long.

789
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:43,532
This is the official
estimate.

790
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:45,467
It's an advance copy.
I thought that was
what you wanted.

791
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:48,670
Pritchard here.

792
00:56:49,673 --> 00:56:51,773
Yes. Of course.

793
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:54,443
I'm sorry, I'm wanted
in the Secretary's office.

794
00:56:54,478 --> 00:56:57,979
I suggest that we
reschedule this meeting.

795
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:00,615
Perhaps
Commander Farrell
and I could continue.

796
00:57:00,650 --> 00:57:02,484
Well, Commander Farrell...
That would be satisfactory.

797
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:04,920
We're both requested at
the Secretary's meeting.

798
00:57:04,955 --> 00:57:07,289
I'm afraid we
really must stop.

799
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:13,895
Kevin, I was wondering
if you might help me in
the counterespionage area.

800
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:16,432
Tom,
we'd better get
to that meeting.

801
00:57:20,136 --> 00:57:21,736
Commander.

802
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:24,506
When you
get more time,
you give me a call.

803
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,308
I can be reached
24 hours a day.

804
00:57:27,344 --> 00:57:28,677
Good.

805
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,682
What was that
supposed to be?

806
00:57:33,717 --> 00:57:35,684
I thought I might
get something out
of him about Yuri.

807
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:38,153
What we have will
be quite sufficient.

808
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:42,691
I want
you to arrange that all
outgoing calls are monitored.

809
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:43,492
All calls?

810
00:57:43,527 --> 00:57:45,126
Don't worry.
Brice's lines are safe.

811
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:47,462
I'll see to it.
Do it now.

812
00:57:47,497 --> 00:57:49,130
- What's that?
- Autopsy report.

813
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:53,268
She died of a broken neck.
Here's a list of her
stomach contents.

814
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,937
Her...
What the hell for?

815
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:58,707
There are different
chemical pollutants
in food.

816
00:57:58,742 --> 00:58:01,643
There's
a chance we might pin down
where she ate her last day.

817
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,555
I want
you to stay close to
the center of things.

818
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:16,157
But you're to do nothing
until you're instructed
by me.

819
00:58:16,192 --> 00:58:17,626
Who are these goons?

820
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,361
They're associated
with Special Forces.

821
00:58:19,396 --> 00:58:20,962
Well, I don't understand
what that means.

822
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,163
What's that mean,
"Associated"?

823
00:58:22,198 --> 00:58:24,065
That means exactly
what I said.

824
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:26,701
They were
formerly in Special Forces
and now they're associated.

825
00:58:26,736 --> 00:58:28,570
Where? Honduras?
El Salvador? Where?

826
00:58:28,605 --> 00:58:29,871
Somewhere down there.

827
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:31,339
What,
are you with
the death squads?

828
00:58:31,374 --> 00:58:33,308
Were they with
the death squads?

829
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,176
It's possible.
In other words,
then they're assassins.

830
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:38,680
You needn't concern yourself.
They work for me now.
Leave us, please!

831
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,560
You haven't
told me everything.

832
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,640
The Atwell woman knew Brice.

833
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:08,043
She was his mistress.

834
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:14,783
Naturally, Brice had no
idea of her connection
with a Soviet agent.

835
00:59:14,818 --> 00:59:17,686
We only found
out last night
after the murder.

836
00:59:17,721 --> 00:59:19,621
Well, then Brice is in
an impossible situation.

837
00:59:19,656 --> 00:59:20,922
We should just
call in the FBI.

838
00:59:20,957 --> 00:59:24,559
Ah, don't be an idiot.

839
00:59:24,594 --> 00:59:27,762
Do you realize the
magnitude of the scandal?

840
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:30,632
The Secretary of Defense
and a Soviet agent,

841
00:59:30,667 --> 00:59:33,602
sharing the favors
of a murdered whore?

842
00:59:33,637 --> 00:59:36,271
David might even be
a suspect in the killing.

843
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:38,640
Yeah, well,
I think that's
something to consider.

844
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,609
Well,
it isn't speculation, Tom.

845
00:59:40,644 --> 00:59:42,978
Brice was with me in my
apartment at the time
of the murder.

846
00:59:43,013 --> 00:59:44,613
He couldn't possibly
have done it...

847
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:47,382
Fine! Fine! Fine!
Let's call in the FBI.
Let Brice take his chances.

848
00:59:47,417 --> 00:59:49,584
That decision is
not yours to make.

849
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:53,755
What we will do is catch
this Yuri ourselves before
anyone knows what's happened.

850
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:55,824
And after we've got him,
we'll handle the rest of it.

851
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:57,258
You mean
the gentlemen
in the next room.

852
00:59:57,293 --> 01:00:00,395
The man we're after
is a spy and a murderer.

853
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,997
Would anyone deny that
justice had been done?

854
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:03,665
Yeah, I would.

855
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,834
Well, we shall
have that discussion
at the appropriate time.

856
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:08,103
But for now, I expect you
to follow direct orders,

857
01:00:08,138 --> 01:00:10,839
and I expect
you to demonstrate
the personal loyalty

858
01:00:10,874 --> 01:00:13,308
to which
both the Secretary
and I have every right.

859
01:00:13,343 --> 01:00:14,442
You expect a lot.

860
01:00:14,477 --> 01:00:15,644
I depend on you.
We're friends.

861
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,078
Oh, God!

862
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:21,116
And, Tom, if it were your
intention to do anything

863
01:00:21,151 --> 01:00:23,652
to bring down David Brice,

864
01:00:23,687 --> 01:00:27,122
then I'd have no choice
but to make sure that
you didn't get away with it.

865
01:00:28,825 --> 01:00:30,859
Thank you for the warning.

866
01:00:30,894 --> 01:00:32,694
I'm quite certain
it's unnecessary.

867
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,330
When you calm down, you'll
see that we're following
the only possible course.

868
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:55,584
I gave them the estimates.
They couldn't have cared less.

869
01:00:58,588 --> 01:00:59,688
Get me Senator Duvall.

870
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:06,828
What's all this top secret
business I've been hearing
about over at the Pentagon?

871
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:10,131
Here's what we do have.
CID is running a phone check.

872
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:13,802
They're
looking for all calls
placed to a Susan Atwell.

873
01:01:13,837 --> 01:01:15,036
Who is she?

874
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:16,871
Well, she's in the
morgue at Fort Meade.

875
01:01:16,906 --> 01:01:18,707
She was murdered last night.

876
01:01:18,742 --> 01:01:21,076
We know anything about it?
Get ready for this.

877
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:24,746
We think she's
either David Brice's or
Scott Pritchard's mistress.

878
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:28,516
Well, she was seen
with both of them.

879
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:29,851
It didn't seem
a high-priority matter,

880
01:01:29,886 --> 01:01:32,887
so my people
have been a little
lax in following it up.

881
01:01:32,922 --> 01:01:37,392
Well, spilt milk.
And you can forget about
Pritchard, he's homosexual.

882
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,896
I'll be damned.

883
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,365
Well, so will he if you
believe the Old Testament.

884
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:45,600
Who killed her?

885
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:47,001
We don't know.

886
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:50,739
They got CID believing
that they're searching
for Yuri.

887
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:53,208
Tell me
nobody swallowed that.

888
01:01:54,978 --> 01:01:57,045
Poor son of a bitch, Brice.

889
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:02,183
You know, I almost
feel sorry for him.

890
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,551
Who's running this
thing at the Pentagon?

891
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:05,920
The new boy, Farrell.

892
01:02:05,955 --> 01:02:08,790
So he can take the fall
in case anything goes wrong.

893
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:11,025
This morning,
he looked like a man who'd
like to have a heart-to-heart.

894
01:02:14,130 --> 01:02:16,832
Yeah. Senator Duvall.

895
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:19,968
Yeah. Listen, Billy.

896
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:23,638
I've been hearing
some very disturbing
news about the Phantom Sub.

897
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:29,744
I tried to talk to
the President about NATO.

898
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:31,813
All he wanted
to talk about was
the Phantom Submarine.

899
01:02:31,848 --> 01:02:34,816
Why the crunch on that
has to come now of all
times is beyond me.

900
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:36,251
We'll just
have to handle it.

901
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:38,620
Well, you got me handling
a hell of a lot, haven't you?

902
01:02:40,990 --> 01:02:43,792
Yeah? Hold.

903
01:02:43,827 --> 01:02:46,361
Commander. Line two.
The other phone.

904
01:02:47,497 --> 01:02:48,830
I'll call you back.

905
01:02:49,799 --> 01:02:50,799
Yeah?

906
01:02:52,836 --> 01:02:55,170
I'll be right down.

907
01:02:55,205 --> 01:02:56,838
They want me in
the computer center.

908
01:02:56,873 --> 01:02:58,173
I'll go with you.

909
01:02:59,475 --> 01:03:01,877
Oh, yeah.
By all means, go with him.

910
01:03:06,049 --> 01:03:07,816
What is it, Sam?
The photo lab said

911
01:03:07,851 --> 01:03:09,984
there's no more image
they can get out of
this Polaroid.

912
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,452
Uh-huh.

913
01:03:11,487 --> 01:03:14,489
Damn. Too much to hope for.
We'll just have to forget it.

914
01:03:14,524 --> 01:03:17,325
Maybe not.
There's something
I want to show you.

915
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,930
Now this is as bad
as your Polaroid,
right?

916
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:24,299
Now watch.
This is a training tape.

917
01:03:24,334 --> 01:03:26,201
I'm speeding it up.

918
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:28,803
The original picture
is broken down into
pixels.

919
01:03:28,838 --> 01:03:32,874
That's the smallest
element on the emulsion.
Sort of an atom of a picture.

920
01:03:32,909 --> 01:03:36,644
Then,
and this is the good part,
the computer just asks itself

921
01:03:36,679 --> 01:03:39,113
what would be next to what
if we played with the pixels.

922
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,882
That's
all there is to it?

923
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:45,019
Well, we do have to
keep on top of the computer.
Computers don't think.

924
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:48,957
For example, if we
had programmed this to come
out a car instead of a monkey,

925
01:03:48,992 --> 01:03:51,560
right now you'd be
looking at a hairy
Buick.

926
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,396
All right then.
Just get started on it.
Oh, wait a minute.

927
01:03:55,431 --> 01:03:57,198
It takes billions
of calculations.

928
01:03:57,233 --> 01:04:00,668
The whole process
may take 12 hours
or it may take a week.

929
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:03,404
Well, that's too long.

930
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:07,242
Perhaps you can
get what you need
from the work in progress.

931
01:04:07,277 --> 01:04:09,077
We'll be watching it
right on this screen.

932
01:04:09,112 --> 01:04:11,980
We've got
our first phone number.
It's listed to a Nina Beka.

933
01:04:12,015 --> 01:04:15,049
She called last night
about the time of the
murder.

934
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,217
I'd better see her.

935
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,587
I was just about
to send my men.

936
01:04:34,938 --> 01:04:36,905
Are you Miss Nina Beka?

937
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,574
Yes.

938
01:04:39,609 --> 01:04:41,075
I'm Commander Farrell,
Miss Beka.

939
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,911
This is Mr. Scott Pritchard,

940
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:44,913
General Counsel to
the Secretary of Defense.

941
01:04:44,948 --> 01:04:46,615
May we come in?

942
01:04:47,383 --> 01:04:49,084
Please. Do come in.

943
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:54,990
I'm afraid
that we have some
bad news for you.

944
01:04:57,593 --> 01:05:00,295
A woman named
Susan Atwell is dead.

945
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,934
She was a friend
of yours?

946
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,970
Yes, she is.

947
01:05:10,173 --> 01:05:12,607
In what way
were you acquainted?

948
01:05:18,614 --> 01:05:25,553
You see,
I work at Shalini's
Boutique in the Pavilion.

949
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,389
She used to come
in there sometimes.

950
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,392
We'd like you to tell us
as much about her as possible.

951
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:34,829
We think she was killed
by a man she'd been seeing.

952
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,598
Why?

953
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,968
Well, you needn't
concern yourself
with why.

954
01:05:40,003 --> 01:05:43,604
We just need to know
the names of the men
that she consorted with.

955
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:44,973
Consorted with?

956
01:05:45,008 --> 01:05:47,408
Yes.

957
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,011
I don't know anything
about Susan's personal life.

958
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:54,148
I'll ask you again,
who were the men
she saw?

959
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:55,984
Well,
you can ask
me 1,000 times

960
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:58,887
and the answer will
still be the same.
I don't know it.

961
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:02,791
You're South African?

962
01:06:04,227 --> 01:06:05,526
That's right.

963
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:08,797
I don't see a US visa.
You're an illegal alien.

964
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:15,603
Do you know who I am?

965
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:18,973
I can pick up that phone

966
01:06:19,008 --> 01:06:22,043
and I can have you
on the first plane
to Johannesburg.

967
01:06:22,078 --> 01:06:25,914
I'm assuming
that you have a reason
for not wanting to be there.

968
01:06:29,252 --> 01:06:33,688
You guessed right.
I know who you are.

969
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:37,825
I know who Brice is,
David Brice.

970
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,060
Is that the name
you're looking for?

971
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,395
We're not interested in him.

972
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,897
There's another
man that we want.

973
01:06:42,932 --> 01:06:44,666
Well, in that case,

974
01:06:46,102 --> 01:06:48,236
why don't we make a deal?

975
01:06:48,271 --> 01:06:51,039
We'll talk about it.
Who is the other man?

976
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:58,212
Who is the other man?

977
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,685
It's someone
at the Pentagon.

978
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:08,056
Does he have a name?

979
01:07:08,091 --> 01:07:11,192
I suppose so,
but I don't know it.

980
01:07:12,261 --> 01:07:14,896
Listen.

981
01:07:14,931 --> 01:07:20,201
All I know
is that Susan used to
see him and he reappeared.

982
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:21,269
How recently?

983
01:07:21,304 --> 01:07:22,904
I don't know.

984
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:24,272
Three months? Two months?
One month?
I don't know!

985
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:27,442
A month, three weeks.
Who cares? I don't know it.

986
01:07:27,477 --> 01:07:31,179
Listen,
she never discussed
these things with me.

987
01:07:31,214 --> 01:07:32,914
All right,
that'll do for now.

988
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:34,282
We're going to close
the part of the
investigation

989
01:07:34,317 --> 01:07:36,584
that concerns you.
Will that be satisfactory?

990
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:41,122
Tom!

991
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,524
Thank you,
Miss Beka.

992
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,126
You've been
very helpful.

993
01:07:56,906 --> 01:07:58,539
Sam!

994
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,942
I want the
names of all civilian
and military personnel

995
01:08:00,977 --> 01:08:03,111
who've been assigned to
the Pentagon during the
past two months.

996
01:08:03,146 --> 01:08:05,146
Can you do it?

997
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:07,381
It's all in the computer.
I'll just have to set up
a program to find it.

998
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,317
Mr. Pritchard.

999
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:11,752
Tom,
I've got a suggestion.

1000
01:08:11,787 --> 01:08:14,789
We're doing
this credit card search,
but it's extremely unlikely

1001
01:08:14,824 --> 01:08:17,758
that anything
charged over the weekend
would be turned in so soon.

1002
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:20,228
We're wasting
valuable computer time
that we could use better.

1003
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:22,730
I know. I want you
to keep on with it.

1004
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,332
What's this
all about, Tom?

1005
01:08:24,367 --> 01:08:26,300
We'll talk about it later.
What do you got here?
What is this?

1006
01:08:26,335 --> 01:08:28,236
I have to see
Secretary Brice.

1007
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:30,805
Just get started
on that list of new
employees, would you?

1008
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:32,406
Yeah, um...

1009
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,776
We isolated three pollutants
in the dead girl's stomach
contents.

1010
01:08:35,811 --> 01:08:38,412
They're the red, green
and blue lines on the graph.

1011
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:43,184
If we can get the overlays
to match, we might pinpoint
where she was.

1012
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,988
So far, it looks
like somewhere near
upper Chesapeake Bay.

1013
01:08:55,398 --> 01:08:56,397
Come in.

1014
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,334
Excuse me, sir,
have you seen
Major Donovan?

1015
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:01,268
No.

1016
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,804
Well, it's important
that I get this to him.

1017
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:05,306
What do you have here?

1018
01:09:05,341 --> 01:09:08,609
Well, we missed it
the first time round.

1019
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,811
It must have fallen
under the seat of her car.

1020
01:09:10,846 --> 01:09:13,481
Uh-huh.
I'll take care of this.

1021
01:09:15,418 --> 01:09:17,051
Very well, sir.

1022
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:24,158
<i>Was this a present?</i>

1023
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,327
Yeah, he gave it to me.

1024
01:09:26,362 --> 01:09:28,229
He has expensive taste.

1025
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:32,066
<i>Didn't cost anything.</i>
<i>Some foreign minister</i>
<i>gave it to him.</i>

1026
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:40,007
I pride myself on being
a man of forbearance
and conciliation.

1027
01:09:40,042 --> 01:09:44,045
But if you fuck me on
this, I'll crucify you!

1028
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:46,080
I am not your
rubber stamp.

1029
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:48,216
You have run roughshod
over this office for
20 years.

1030
01:09:48,251 --> 01:09:49,850
And that's over!

1031
01:09:49,885 --> 01:09:52,753
Sir,
you may disparage your
predecessors all you like,

1032
01:09:52,788 --> 01:09:56,224
but I don't
recall in the past
any secret investigation

1033
01:09:56,259 --> 01:09:58,826
that required the
entire Department
of Defense,

1034
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:03,397
circumvented
CIA and the FBI and
the Washington Police.

1035
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:07,001
Senator, we're not locked
into any position on the
Phantom Sub.

1036
01:10:07,036 --> 01:10:08,669
What are you saying?

1037
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,339
I'm just
trying to allay
Senator Duvall's fears

1038
01:10:11,374 --> 01:10:12,673
that we might
act peremptorily.

1039
01:10:12,708 --> 01:10:15,276
We will act the way
I decide on this matter.

1040
01:10:15,311 --> 01:10:19,880
Gentlemen,
I don't see any point in
squabbling like children.

1041
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:22,783
Mr. Pritchard,
I'm encouraged
by your attitude.

1042
01:10:22,818 --> 01:10:25,519
I'm sure
your investigation,
or whatever it is,

1043
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:27,788
is perfectly proper.

1044
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,858
I must apologize
for my unseemly
outburst.

1045
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,394
It's just that I've
been sorely troubled.

1046
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,097
Well, that's perfectly
understandable, Senator.

1047
01:10:36,132 --> 01:10:38,032
I'm certain that we can
reach an accommodation.

1048
01:10:38,067 --> 01:10:42,303
Mmm. Gentlemen,
I'm deeply gratified.

1049
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:48,576
Deeply gratified and I hope
you'll forgive my imposition
on such a busy day.

1050
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,487
He's got us.

1051
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:01,722
This is insane.
It's out of control.

1052
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,824
Your cover story's
not gonna hold water.

1053
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:07,295
Yes, it will,
but you have to have
more moral courage.

1054
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:19,573
Have you ever
heard of a woman
named Nina Beka?

1055
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:20,675
No.

1056
01:11:22,178 --> 01:11:24,178
Well, she's
heard of you.

1057
01:11:26,349 --> 01:11:29,150
Instruct the CIA to get in
touch with you at your home.

1058
01:11:29,185 --> 01:11:31,319
I want you to remain there
and wait for the information.

1059
01:11:31,354 --> 01:11:33,954
You're not to call me.
I'll check in with
you periodically.

1060
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:35,356
Yes, sir.

1061
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:36,424
...as quickly
as possible.

1062
01:11:36,459 --> 01:11:37,358
Okay.

1063
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:46,200
Hey! You two!

1064
01:11:50,906 --> 01:11:52,873
Scott, where
are they going?

1065
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:55,176
What's the matter?
Laurel and Hardy,
where are they going?

1066
01:11:55,211 --> 01:11:57,311
Who's that, Tom?
You know who I mean,
the bookends.

1067
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:59,247
I sent them
on an errand.

1068
01:12:02,585 --> 01:12:05,553
Tom. Tom! Tom!

1069
01:12:09,592 --> 01:12:11,125
I need a car.
It's an emergency.

1070
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:12,993
Uh...
I'm sorry, Commander.
CID's got everything.

1071
01:12:13,028 --> 01:12:14,795
This one!
Bring this one down!
Hey! No, you can't take that.

1072
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:16,564
The lift is busted.
The man's gonna
come fix it. Come on.

1073
01:12:16,599 --> 01:12:18,332
Watch your toes.

1074
01:12:18,367 --> 01:12:21,436
Mike, come on!
Get out of there!
Get out of there right now!

1075
01:12:38,421 --> 01:12:39,520
Shit.

1076
01:13:10,786 --> 01:13:12,887
Shit.
Hi.

1077
01:13:22,097 --> 01:13:24,198
Shit. God damn it,
get him!

1078
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,801
Come on, hurry up!

1079
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,337
Hey, what are you
doing? You crazy?

1080
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:37,938
Oh, shit!

1081
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:39,740
Hey, you okay?

1082
01:15:12,775 --> 01:15:14,509
- I'm sorry.
- Hey! Slow down!

1083
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:32,426
Look out!

1084
01:15:34,697 --> 01:15:36,397
Hey, you almost
killed a guy here!

1085
01:15:41,136 --> 01:15:43,471
I'm gonna get you,
motherfucker!

1086
01:16:31,854 --> 01:16:33,487
Nina, come with me!

1087
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:34,955
Tom!

1088
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:36,724
We can't talk!
Now, is there a back
way out of this place?

1089
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:37,992
What happened to Susan?

1090
01:16:38,027 --> 01:16:40,594
We cannot talk now.
You're in danger,
all right?

1091
01:16:40,629 --> 01:16:42,262
What's going on?
It doesn't...

1092
01:16:43,799 --> 01:16:45,065
Can I go
to my place?

1093
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,535
No,
don't go there.
They'll kill you.

1094
01:16:49,138 --> 01:16:51,672
Oh, my God!

1095
01:16:51,707 --> 01:16:54,808
You have to get lost,
and I mean really,
really lost.

1096
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:56,544
Thank you for before.

1097
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,846
Go!
There he is!

1098
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:11,458
- Look out!
- He's got a gun!

1099
01:17:11,493 --> 01:17:14,628
I think
we should go back
to the Pentagon, sir.

1100
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:25,906
That was a stupid,
stupid thing you did.

1101
01:17:27,743 --> 01:17:29,109
I think you're crazy.

1102
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:31,311
I'm going to save Brice,
no matter what it takes.

1103
01:17:31,346 --> 01:17:32,680
I thought I already
told you that.

1104
01:17:32,715 --> 01:17:33,681
I don't believe
there is a Yuri.

1105
01:17:33,716 --> 01:17:35,115
Oh, he's real enough,
all right.

1106
01:17:35,150 --> 01:17:36,150
Yeah, but he doesn't
have anything to do

1107
01:17:36,185 --> 01:17:37,317
with the murder
of that girl, does he?

1108
01:17:37,352 --> 01:17:38,886
We'll find that out
when we catch him.

1109
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:40,954
Not
if those two get to
him first, you won't.

1110
01:17:40,989 --> 01:17:44,825
Damn it!
I am tired of weakness.

1111
01:17:44,860 --> 01:17:46,727
I am faced with
a grave problem,

1112
01:17:46,762 --> 01:17:49,730
and I intend
to resolve it
quickly and cleanly.

1113
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,699
You really are crazy.
You're fucking cuckoo.

1114
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:55,135
I won't be insulted by you
and you're not to attempt
to interfere

1115
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,706
with this
investigation again.
Do I make myself clear?

1116
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:00,874
I quit.

1117
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:01,909
Your resignation
is not accepted.

1118
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:03,577
Yeah?
Tom! Be reasonable.

1119
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:05,746
I'm deliberately
shielding you
from full knowledge.

1120
01:18:05,781 --> 01:18:09,750
Just follow your orders
and everything will be
all right. Let him go!

1121
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,758
Will you excuse me,
please?

1122
01:18:19,194 --> 01:18:20,928
I hope you're not
calling your girlfriend.

1123
01:18:20,963 --> 01:18:23,931
Remember,
Big Brother's listening.

1124
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,767
Yeah, well,
I don't give a shit.

1125
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:28,202
<i>Hello?</i>
Fox!

1126
01:18:28,237 --> 01:18:31,338
<i>Oh, hello, sir.</i>
<i>The writing on</i>
<i>the box is Arabic,</i>

1127
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,007
<i>but it's in the</i>
<i>Maghrebi dialect.</i>

1128
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,943
<i>That's what</i>
<i>they speak in Morocco.</i>

1129
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:39,113
<i>Uh, what it says</i>
<i>is kind of flowery,</i>
<i>but it boils down to,</i>

1130
01:18:39,148 --> 01:18:41,849
<i>"A gift to a true friend."</i>

1131
01:18:41,884 --> 01:18:43,984
Good boy.
You can come back now.

1132
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:51,826
Oh, jeez.

1133
01:18:58,967 --> 01:19:02,470
The Polaroid just came
online. Not much to
look at, is it?

1134
01:19:03,338 --> 01:19:04,772
No, it's not.

1135
01:19:08,477 --> 01:19:09,777
Don't gifts from
foreign governments

1136
01:19:09,812 --> 01:19:12,412
have to be registered
with the Office of Protocol?

1137
01:19:12,447 --> 01:19:13,580
That's what they tell us.

1138
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:15,549
Are their files computerized?

1139
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:18,418
Yes. Of course, they would be
in the Department of State's
computer bank.

1140
01:19:18,453 --> 01:19:21,622
Can we access those files?

1141
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:25,459
They're closed.
You'll have to get in
touch with them tomorrow.

1142
01:19:26,995 --> 01:19:29,263
I can't get
in touch with them.

1143
01:19:41,043 --> 01:19:42,643
We can interface.

1144
01:19:42,678 --> 01:19:44,311
Can you do it now?

1145
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:48,382
There'll be hell to pay.

1146
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:50,818
Tom.

1147
01:19:51,954 --> 01:19:54,054
Does it matter
to you that much?

1148
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,528
Okay.

1149
01:20:02,231 --> 01:20:04,899
Thanks.
I'll be back
in five minutes.

1150
01:20:09,638 --> 01:20:10,905
Come in.

1151
01:20:15,711 --> 01:20:17,077
What is it now?

1152
01:20:20,849 --> 01:20:23,283
I've been
thinking it over
and maybe you're right.

1153
01:20:23,318 --> 01:20:25,052
Yes?

1154
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:28,055
Let's just
get this whole
business over with.

1155
01:20:28,090 --> 01:20:30,090
And I'm sorry
I blew up at you.

1156
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:34,028
We're all very tired.

1157
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:40,033
Tom,

1158
01:20:40,068 --> 01:20:43,737
when this is out of the way,
we can do great things here.

1159
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:48,943
Well, first things first.

1160
01:20:59,922 --> 01:21:01,154
How we doing, Sam?

1161
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:03,924
I'm into the
State Department
computer. It was easy.

1162
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,092
Can you print
that out for me?

1163
01:21:05,127 --> 01:21:07,327
You got it.

1164
01:21:07,362 --> 01:21:09,329
A lot of paper.

1165
01:21:09,364 --> 01:21:11,331
Oh, and you were right
about the credit card
receipts.

1166
01:21:11,366 --> 01:21:14,334
We found one from
a gas station in
Annapolis.

1167
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:16,770
Great.

1168
01:21:19,775 --> 01:21:21,108
These are the new
people at the Pentagon?

1169
01:21:21,143 --> 01:21:24,077
Yeah.
There are 4,700
possibles so far,

1170
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:28,616
but we've had a real break.
The CID has pinned down
your man's blood type.

1171
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:30,884
How'd they get that?

1172
01:21:30,919 --> 01:21:33,053
Autopsy specimen.

1173
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,122
There was a residue of
semen in the woman's body.

1174
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:37,024
Blood type is A positive.

1175
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:39,994
That's pretty common,
but it'll help narrow
the list.

1176
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,331
You're a genius, Sam.

1177
01:21:46,001 --> 01:21:48,969
I am, I am, I am.

1178
01:22:05,187 --> 01:22:08,422
You should
get some sleep.
You must be exhausted.

1179
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:11,825
I know if I'm
exhausted or not.

1180
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:14,962
As you say.

1181
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:19,433
You look like you just
stepped out of a bandbox.

1182
01:22:19,468 --> 01:22:21,635
You're
actually enjoying
this, aren't you?

1183
01:22:21,670 --> 01:22:26,373
I'm just trying to do my job.
It would be a lot easier if
you'd stop attacking me.

1184
01:22:30,212 --> 01:22:32,779
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired.

1185
01:22:32,814 --> 01:22:34,281
I've got
a lot on my mind.

1186
01:22:38,487 --> 01:22:41,154
If it
doesn't keep moving
towards a coherent image,

1187
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:43,023
we just adjust the program.

1188
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:48,829
You mean, you could
stop it and make it go
in another direction?

1189
01:22:48,864 --> 01:22:50,630
We've been doing that
all along.

1190
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,700
It looks like
it's doing fine now.

1191
01:22:58,473 --> 01:22:59,974
I'm not so sure.

1192
01:23:25,267 --> 01:23:27,668
I think
it's time we had a talk.

1193
01:23:39,681 --> 01:23:42,049
I'm the one in
the picture, Sam.

1194
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,485
You?

1195
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:46,854
Mmm-hmm.

1196
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:53,693
Susan Atwell
was the woman
I'd been seeing.

1197
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,030
I had
nothing to do
with her death.

1198
01:23:57,299 --> 01:23:59,133
I was in love with her.

1199
01:24:01,536 --> 01:24:03,904
Oh, Jesus, you
must feel terrible.

1200
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:11,278
You're the only one
I can tell that this
spy hunt thing's a phony.

1201
01:24:11,313 --> 01:24:12,846
Yuri doesn't
have anything to
do with the murder?

1202
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,181
Nothing.

1203
01:24:14,216 --> 01:24:18,051
This, uh...
This, it's a cover-up.

1204
01:24:18,086 --> 01:24:19,119
That's all
I can tell you.

1205
01:24:19,154 --> 01:24:20,287
Come on!

1206
01:24:20,322 --> 01:24:22,489
God damn it, Sam,
this is...

1207
01:24:24,326 --> 01:24:27,527
This is for your own
protection, all right?

1208
01:24:27,562 --> 01:24:31,131
These people have already
tried to kill one person
who knew.

1209
01:24:32,467 --> 01:24:33,900
Well,
what do you
want me to do?

1210
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:36,103
Will you slow up
the resolution
on that picture?

1211
01:24:36,138 --> 01:24:40,307
I need more time, Sam.
I need more time to get
this straightened out.

1212
01:24:51,153 --> 01:24:53,120
That's what I need.

1213
01:25:10,805 --> 01:25:12,672
I'm not satisfied with
the way this is coming up.

1214
01:25:12,707 --> 01:25:13,707
The eigenvalue is off.

1215
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,176
Looks all right to me.

1216
01:25:16,211 --> 01:25:18,912
We're pulling away from
our reference information.

1217
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:22,415
Advise
them to program
a Fourier transform.

1218
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:24,251
I don't know.
That seems like
a waste of time.

1219
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:26,987
Just do
what I want, okay?

1220
01:25:27,022 --> 01:25:29,623
Take it easy, Sam.
We're all working the
same amount of time.

1221
01:25:29,658 --> 01:25:32,459
I'm sorry, David.
Just do it, please, okay?

1222
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:52,212
What are you
looking for?

1223
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:53,647
Fuck off.

1224
01:26:09,331 --> 01:26:11,265
Where are you going?

1225
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:22,375
I would rather
do this myself.

1226
01:26:22,410 --> 01:26:24,678
You can listen
if you want to.

1227
01:26:36,224 --> 01:26:38,091
Display that badge.
Good day.

1228
01:26:39,127 --> 01:26:40,360
This goes here?

1229
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,828
Yeah.

1230
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,029
Where are we going?

1231
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:44,564
We're gonna go down
to Major Donovan's
office.

1232
01:26:44,599 --> 01:26:46,666
You can give
a full description
of this guy to him.

1233
01:26:46,701 --> 01:26:47,834
Who the hell's Donovan?

1234
01:26:47,869 --> 01:26:49,469
He's our commanding officer.

1235
01:27:42,524 --> 01:27:45,425
Hello?
You know who this is?

1236
01:27:48,330 --> 01:27:53,166
I have to talk to you,
but I can't leave here now.

1237
01:27:53,201 --> 01:27:56,870
I'm on
the damn pay phone now.
It's probably not even safe.

1238
01:28:01,543 --> 01:28:05,178
All right,
I'll come there as
soon as I can get away.

1239
01:28:19,227 --> 01:28:21,127
I'll be damned.
Well, that's him.

1240
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,329
The son of a bitch
who rented the boat!

1241
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:23,863
Where?

1242
01:28:23,898 --> 01:28:26,733
Look, right there.
He just went
around the corner.

1243
01:28:31,806 --> 01:28:33,473
Do you see him?

1244
01:28:34,809 --> 01:28:36,209
He's gone.

1245
01:28:37,812 --> 01:28:40,980
I'll get back to you.
Where've you been?
Yuri's in the building.

1246
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,782
Would you buzz
the Secretary please?
They were bringing in

1247
01:28:42,817 --> 01:28:44,484
a witness
and he spotted him.
I know.

1248
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:45,785
<i>Send him in.</i>
Can I go in?

1249
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:46,886
Go right in.

1250
01:28:46,921 --> 01:28:49,823
Well, what are
my orders, sir?

1251
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:53,626
Close all the exits, Major.
Hold your witness while
we decide what to do.

1252
01:28:53,661 --> 01:28:55,028
Yes, sir.

1253
01:28:58,566 --> 01:29:00,400
Is Yuri in the building?
So it would seem.

1254
01:29:00,435 --> 01:29:01,401
This is splendid work,
Tom.

1255
01:29:01,436 --> 01:29:05,739
I've had all
the exits closed.

1256
01:29:05,774 --> 01:29:10,577
Well, why don't we empty
the building and just have
everybody file past this man?

1257
01:29:10,612 --> 01:29:13,413
And in five minutes,
the place will be swarming
with television cameramen.

1258
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:16,015
We'll just have to take
the witness through the
building, room by room.

1259
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:17,584
Well, it's the largest
building in the world!

1260
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:20,854
But it's the only way
we'll get any privacy.

1261
01:29:20,889 --> 01:29:22,356
I'll see to it.

1262
01:29:23,792 --> 01:29:25,425
Major Donovan.
Sir?

1263
01:29:25,460 --> 01:29:29,062
I suggest that all officers
carry sidearms.

1264
01:29:29,097 --> 01:29:31,998
The man
we're after has killed
at least one person already.

1265
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:35,235
Don't worry, Tom.
I don't expect
you to carry one.

1266
01:29:54,322 --> 01:29:57,624
Tall or short?
Thin or fat?
Light or dark?

1267
01:29:57,659 --> 01:29:59,292
That's right.

1268
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:01,194
Do you think this
is some kind of joke?

1269
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:05,064
What I'm trying to
tell you is the son
of a bitch is average.

1270
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:10,203
All right, let's go find
this average son of a bitch.

1271
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:12,439
Oh,
yeah, I'm positive
I remember this guy.

1272
01:30:12,474 --> 01:30:16,309
I always remember
the good tippers.

1273
01:30:22,484 --> 01:30:25,418
CID has brought
in another witness.

1274
01:30:25,453 --> 01:30:28,621
A bellboy
from a hotel
in Annapolis.

1275
01:30:28,656 --> 01:30:32,659
Now you can have
two search parties.

1276
01:30:32,694 --> 01:30:36,596
That's great news.
We can move twice
as fast.

1277
01:30:36,631 --> 01:30:38,298
I'll see to it.

1278
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:50,109
You see, David?
It's all coming
together.

1279
01:30:50,144 --> 01:30:52,379
Dear God,
I hope you're right.

1280
01:31:16,538 --> 01:31:19,372
All right, down this
corridor. Make it quick.

1281
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:21,374
Let's go.

1282
01:31:52,407 --> 01:31:53,673
That ain't him.
I just rented
the guy a sailboat.

1283
01:31:53,708 --> 01:31:54,874
All right,
down here.

1284
01:31:54,909 --> 01:31:57,777
Give me a break.
Jesus, I'm sick
of this shit.

1285
01:32:11,426 --> 01:32:12,992
How much longer?

1286
01:32:13,027 --> 01:32:14,928
Oh, Scott,
it's impossible to
search this entire building.

1287
01:32:14,963 --> 01:32:16,729
It would take all night.

1288
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:18,765
We have
a shift finishing at
5:00 and one at 6:00.

1289
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:20,533
What do you
suggest we do then?

1290
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:23,770
Let them out through
the mall entrance. We'll
have both witnesses there.

1291
01:32:23,805 --> 01:32:25,639
What do you think?

1292
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:28,608
Television.

1293
01:32:28,643 --> 01:32:30,209
<i>We haven't been</i>
<i>allowed inside,</i>
<i>Mark,</i>

1294
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,412
<i>but we're told there's</i>
<i>a bottleneck of hundreds,</i>

1295
01:32:32,447 --> 01:32:35,415
<i>perhaps</i>
<i>thousands of people</i>
<i>waiting to go home.</i>

1296
01:32:35,450 --> 01:32:37,050
<i>Those who have been</i>
<i>allowed to leave</i>

1297
01:32:37,085 --> 01:32:39,786
<i>say they were</i>
<i>first cleared by</i>
<i>members of the CID.</i>

1298
01:32:39,821 --> 01:32:43,590
<i>That's the Criminal</i>
<i>Investigation Division</i>
<i>of Army Intelligence.</i>

1299
01:32:43,625 --> 01:32:47,794
<i>Apparently,</i>
<i>there's a search on for</i>
<i>a person who may be a spy,</i>

1300
01:32:47,829 --> 01:32:51,431
<i>trapped right now</i>
<i>inside the Pentagon itself.</i>

1301
01:32:51,466 --> 01:32:54,033
<i>We will stay here</i>
<i>and follow events</i>
<i>as they develop,</i>

1302
01:32:54,068 --> 01:32:56,803
and we'll get back to you
with updates as the story
continues.

1303
01:32:56,838 --> 01:32:59,906
Melissa Donaldson,
WCDM, at the Pentagon.

1304
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:02,775
He must have
gotten out past us.

1305
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:04,978
No way.
He's hiding somewhere
in the building.

1306
01:33:06,848 --> 01:33:09,048
We'll have to go back
to the room-to-room.

1307
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:13,252
We'll go down to the basement
level, search the situation
room, computer complex.

1308
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:16,623
We'll start at the bottom
and work our way up.
Let's do it.

1309
01:33:16,658 --> 01:33:18,825
Jesus.

1310
01:33:21,863 --> 01:33:23,630
You're to initial this, sir.
What?

1311
01:33:23,665 --> 01:33:25,798
You're to initial this.
What is it?

1312
01:33:25,833 --> 01:33:29,769
It's authorization
to release the Atwell
woman's body for burial.

1313
01:33:36,644 --> 01:33:38,678
We're down
to about 50 persons
with A positive blood.

1314
01:33:38,713 --> 01:33:40,680
How many are men?

1315
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:42,448
Oh, come on.
Nobody told me I had
to sort them out by sex.

1316
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:45,118
Look, I gotta
take a break, man.

1317
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:47,220
Sam, I need
to talk to you.

1318
01:33:57,699 --> 01:33:58,798
I have to have your help.

1319
01:33:58,833 --> 01:34:00,867
I slowed it up
as much as I could...

1320
01:34:00,902 --> 01:34:02,268
I know, but they're gonna
be able to recognize
this picture soon.

1321
01:34:02,303 --> 01:34:03,670
There's nothing
more I can do.

1322
01:34:03,705 --> 01:34:05,672
They mean to
kill me, Sam.

1323
01:34:05,707 --> 01:34:06,839
Tom, you haven't
slept for two days.

1324
01:34:06,874 --> 01:34:07,940
I'm telling you the truth.

1325
01:34:07,975 --> 01:34:09,442
I don't stand
a chance in hell.

1326
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:10,710
For God sakes, why?

1327
01:34:10,745 --> 01:34:12,779
If you didn't have anything
to do with the girl's murder,

1328
01:34:12,814 --> 01:34:13,880
why would anybody want...

1329
01:34:13,915 --> 01:34:15,014
Brice killed her.

1330
01:34:15,049 --> 01:34:16,949
Brice?
She was his mistress.

1331
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,218
I thought she
was your girl.
Look.

1332
01:34:19,253 --> 01:34:20,587
This?

1333
01:34:22,757 --> 01:34:24,123
See this?
"Antique gold box..."

1334
01:34:24,158 --> 01:34:26,359
This is a present to Brice
from the Moroccan government.

1335
01:34:26,394 --> 01:34:27,960
He gave it to Susan.

1336
01:34:27,995 --> 01:34:29,896
It's the only way
I can prove he knew her.

1337
01:34:29,931 --> 01:34:32,999
He'll call off the search,
Sam, I know he will.

1338
01:34:34,202 --> 01:34:35,702
I see.

1339
01:34:35,737 --> 01:34:38,137
Do you believe me?

1340
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:42,909
Well, then... Well, then,
can you insert that into the
State Department's computer?

1341
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:46,780
I could do that.
I know you can,
Sam, but will you?

1342
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:49,816
I'll do whatever
I have to do to
help you.

1343
01:34:49,851 --> 01:34:51,418
Then let's do it.

1344
01:35:29,390 --> 01:35:31,023
I'm standing there.
There's nothing there, Sam.

1345
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:32,959
If you just
want a piece of paper,
you can type it yourself.

1346
01:35:32,994 --> 01:35:34,961
I thought we just print...

1347
01:35:34,996 --> 01:35:37,597
The computer is searching
the Protocol list to find
the right place to insert it,

1348
01:35:37,632 --> 01:35:38,631
and then it'll
print that out.

1349
01:35:38,666 --> 01:35:39,932
All right, how long?

1350
01:35:39,967 --> 01:35:41,601
Soon.

1351
01:35:41,636 --> 01:35:44,804
All right,
first two on the right,
second two on the left.

1352
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:48,374
Last man
in the doorway.
Nobody in or out.

1353
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:49,776
What's going on here?

1354
01:35:49,811 --> 01:35:50,877
We're getting ready
to search in here.

1355
01:35:50,912 --> 01:35:52,779
I can see that.
Who told you to
bring them in here?

1356
01:35:52,814 --> 01:35:56,783
Nobody. This is the only
major area that hasn't
been covered yet.

1357
01:35:59,854 --> 01:36:01,220
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

1358
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:03,823
we'll be conducting
a search in here and
I ask you all,

1359
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:05,625
please...
Sir, wait.

1360
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:06,826
Oh, Jesus.

1361
01:36:06,861 --> 01:36:08,661
It's okay.

1362
01:36:08,696 --> 01:36:10,263
I have to change.

1363
01:36:12,834 --> 01:36:14,467
Okay,
let's get going.

1364
01:36:14,502 --> 01:36:15,835
Don't let anyone pass.

1365
01:36:40,328 --> 01:36:41,961
Sam Hesselman.

1366
01:36:43,698 --> 01:36:48,001
Look,
I'm sorry to bother you,
but this is over my head.

1367
01:36:49,637 --> 01:36:51,871
It's about Commander Farrell.

1368
01:36:53,140 --> 01:36:54,707
I'm not sure.

1369
01:36:57,645 --> 01:37:00,046
I'm not sure
he knows what he's doing.

1370
01:37:01,916 --> 01:37:03,316
All right,
I'll meet you.

1371
01:37:03,351 --> 01:37:05,318
Please,
don't mention
this to anybody else.

1372
01:37:05,353 --> 01:37:10,056
I mean, the reason
I called you was because
I know you're his friend.

1373
01:37:10,091 --> 01:37:11,724
You did the right thing.

1374
01:37:17,431 --> 01:37:18,831
This door is locked.

1375
01:37:18,866 --> 01:37:21,868
Anybody have
a master key out here?

1376
01:37:24,105 --> 01:37:26,205
This is Commander Farrell's
office, isn't it?

1377
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:28,374
Yeah, we better
have a look anyway.

1378
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:44,090
Well, tell you what...
There we go.
Maybe this will work.

1379
01:38:08,983 --> 01:38:10,750
Nobody here.

1380
01:38:10,785 --> 01:38:15,088
Let's get on up the hall here,
gentlemen, and see what else
we can come up with.

1381
01:38:32,139 --> 01:38:32,938
Hi.

1382
01:38:35,076 --> 01:38:37,610
What's this all about,
Dr. Hesselman?

1383
01:38:40,014 --> 01:38:43,282
You have to promise me
that what I tell you
won't go any further.

1384
01:38:43,317 --> 01:38:45,384
I feel disloyal
enough as it is.

1385
01:38:45,419 --> 01:38:46,819
Of course.

1386
01:38:48,622 --> 01:38:51,958
You understand that
Tom is under great
strain.

1387
01:38:51,993 --> 01:38:53,026
Yes.

1388
01:38:54,161 --> 01:38:56,629
He knew the girl
who was murdered.

1389
01:38:57,365 --> 01:38:58,831
They were

1390
01:38:59,467 --> 01:39:01,968
very close.

1391
01:39:02,003 --> 01:39:04,938
And he thinks that
Secretary Brice
killed her.

1392
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:08,641
Look, I know him.

1393
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:11,410
He's much
more high-strung
than he appears.

1394
01:39:11,445 --> 01:39:13,012
And this girl, uh...

1395
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:17,817
I guess he was
in love with her.

1396
01:39:19,620 --> 01:39:21,520
And anyway, now he thinks
that somebody wants
to kill him,

1397
01:39:21,555 --> 01:39:25,058
and he
asked me to reprogram
the computers and I did it.

1398
01:39:26,193 --> 01:39:28,594
But now, uh...

1399
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:32,031
I don't know.
I just don't know.

1400
01:39:32,066 --> 01:39:35,801
I see. Where
is Commander Farrell now?

1401
01:39:35,836 --> 01:39:39,205
I suppose
he's in his office or
in the computer room.

1402
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,673
Thank you.

1403
01:40:53,981 --> 01:40:55,448
Son of a bitch.

1404
01:42:00,714 --> 01:42:04,016
- Hey! Wait!
- Come back here!

1405
01:42:04,051 --> 01:42:06,352
Hold it right there!
Hold it!

1406
01:42:06,387 --> 01:42:08,354
Sergeant,
arrest that man.

1407
01:42:08,389 --> 01:42:11,257
I'm your superior and I'm
giving you a direct order
to arrest this man.

1408
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:12,291
I have my orders
from Mr. Pritchard...

1409
01:42:12,326 --> 01:42:13,993
Do it!

1410
01:42:14,028 --> 01:42:15,027
I have my orders from...

1411
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:16,262
Shut up!

1412
01:42:16,297 --> 01:42:17,429
Jesus.

1413
01:42:18,799 --> 01:42:20,366
And if he resists,
shoot him!
Yes, sir.

1414
01:42:20,401 --> 01:42:22,201
Where are you going,
Commander?

1415
01:42:22,236 --> 01:42:24,603
You can't go in there.
You can't go in there!

1416
01:42:24,638 --> 01:42:26,372
I said you can't
go in there.

1417
01:42:26,407 --> 01:42:27,940
Commander, by what right
do you have to come in
here?

1418
01:42:27,975 --> 01:42:29,608
Call off the search now.
Lorraine, thank you.

1419
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:31,310
You're not looking
for a Russian spy.

1420
01:42:31,345 --> 01:42:33,212
You're looking for somebody
who knows Susan Atwell was
your mistress.

1421
01:42:33,247 --> 01:42:35,214
What are you talking about?

1422
01:42:35,249 --> 01:42:37,316
You gave her a gold box
that a Moroccan foreign
minister gave to you.

1423
01:42:37,351 --> 01:42:38,617
I don't know what
you're talking about...

1424
01:42:38,652 --> 01:42:40,186
Well, you declared it
to the Office of Protocol!

1425
01:42:40,221 --> 01:42:42,221
I never declared anything
to the Office of Protocol!
Yeah?

1426
01:42:42,256 --> 01:42:44,223
Well, you tell it to
the State's computer.

1427
01:42:44,258 --> 01:42:45,824
What?

1428
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:47,226
You tell it
to the computer at
the State Department.

1429
01:42:47,261 --> 01:42:50,362
Now pick up the phone
and call off the search now!

1430
01:42:50,397 --> 01:42:51,530
Will you just...

1431
01:42:51,565 --> 01:42:53,165
Do it, or I swear to God,
I'll nail you to the wall.

1432
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:59,305
Calm down. I'll get
Scott in here, we'll...
Come in, for God's sake.

1433
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:02,241
I'm sorry, Mr. Secretary.
I had to make sure you
were all right.

1434
01:43:02,276 --> 01:43:05,044
Yuri must be close.
There's been a murder.

1435
01:43:05,879 --> 01:43:07,846
He shot Dr. Hesselman.

1436
01:43:07,881 --> 01:43:09,415
Oh, God damn it.

1437
01:43:09,450 --> 01:43:11,584
What's happened, Major?

1438
01:43:11,619 --> 01:43:14,053
I think we got Yuri cornered.
He's somewhere between here,

1439
01:43:14,088 --> 01:43:16,222
Communications and
the officers' gymnasium.

1440
01:43:16,257 --> 01:43:19,258
That's very good, Major.
Just continue the search.

1441
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:32,438
You had those apes
kill him, didn't you?

1442
01:43:32,473 --> 01:43:33,706
No.

1443
01:43:33,741 --> 01:43:36,075
You...
You lying sack of shit.

1444
01:43:38,445 --> 01:43:42,281
Tom is the man who
saw you at Susan's.

1445
01:43:42,316 --> 01:43:44,283
He's known
about you all along.

1446
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:45,318
Isn't that right?

1447
01:43:46,387 --> 01:43:48,887
You know what
that means, David?

1448
01:43:48,922 --> 01:43:52,258
If Commander Farrell
is the man who was
with Miss Atwell,

1449
01:43:52,293 --> 01:43:55,294
then Commander Farrell
is the man who killed
Miss Atwell.

1450
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:59,465
And we know that the man
who killed Miss Atwell
is Yuri.

1451
01:43:59,500 --> 01:44:02,468
Therefore,
Commander Farrell is Yuri,

1452
01:44:02,503 --> 01:44:04,803
<i>quod erat demonstrandum.</i>

1453
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:08,908
You murdered
Sam, didn't you?
You're a fucking asshole.

1454
01:44:13,914 --> 01:44:18,751
You have no idea what
men of power can do!

1455
01:44:18,786 --> 01:44:20,319
You fucking...

1456
01:44:20,354 --> 01:44:24,490
Wait! Wait a second.
Scott has been a loyal
and valuable friend.

1457
01:44:24,525 --> 01:44:30,329
I let that friendship cloud
my judgment. My actions have
been inexcusable.

1458
01:44:30,364 --> 01:44:33,366
Scott! Scott!

1459
01:44:34,702 --> 01:44:37,636
Give me the gun.

1460
01:44:37,671 --> 01:44:40,306
This is the hardest
thing I've ever had
to do in my life.

1461
01:44:40,341 --> 01:44:43,342
But I swear,
I'll do everything
I can to help you out.

1462
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:46,112
Everything!
I'll get you
the best lawyers.

1463
01:44:49,316 --> 01:44:52,618
David? He doesn't
have a shred of proof.

1464
01:44:54,555 --> 01:44:57,523
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1465
01:44:57,558 --> 01:45:01,960
He was fiercely jealous
of Susan. A man like that,
do you understand?

1466
01:45:01,995 --> 01:45:05,130
Suppose we had planned
on working late Sunday
night.

1467
01:45:05,165 --> 01:45:07,299
I didn't arrive.
He assumed I was
with Susan.

1468
01:45:07,334 --> 01:45:08,367
David?

1469
01:45:08,402 --> 01:45:09,802
Don't touch me!

1470
01:45:09,837 --> 01:45:12,338
He went there looking
for me. They argued.

1471
01:45:12,373 --> 01:45:13,872
Well, you can assume
the rest, right?

1472
01:45:13,907 --> 01:45:15,374
Just save your breath.

1473
01:45:15,409 --> 01:45:19,678
Help me out of this.
Help. Help me out.
Help me out.

1474
01:45:19,713 --> 01:45:24,183
Listen, I'll give you
anything you want. I swear.

1475
01:45:24,218 --> 01:45:27,786
I'll give you anything
you want. Listen to me,
listen to me. Help me out.

1476
01:45:27,821 --> 01:45:31,390
I will give you anything
you want. Just help me
out of this.

1477
01:45:31,425 --> 01:45:33,192
You can have
anything you want.

1478
01:45:33,227 --> 01:45:36,895
If you go against me on this,
it'll be your word against
mine and I'll win.

1479
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:38,164
David!

1480
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:41,000
Scott!
No!

1481
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:52,344
What's
going on in there?

1482
01:45:52,379 --> 01:45:53,579
Mr. Secretary?

1483
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,182
Oh!

1484
01:45:57,217 --> 01:46:00,018
Oh, my God!

1485
01:46:00,053 --> 01:46:01,520
Nelson.

1486
01:46:06,860 --> 01:46:08,961
Your search is over, Major.

1487
01:46:13,267 --> 01:46:14,366
Is this...

1488
01:46:14,401 --> 01:46:15,901
He shot himself.

1489
01:46:20,607 --> 01:46:21,974
Anderson.

1490
01:46:26,613 --> 01:46:28,247
No, I did not...

1491
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:34,420
Commander,
do I have your answer?

1492
01:46:34,455 --> 01:46:38,190
Commander? Sir? Sir,
are you all right, sir?

1493
01:46:38,225 --> 01:46:40,058
Give me your pen.
Sir?

1494
01:46:40,093 --> 01:46:41,427
You got a pen?
Oh, yes, sir.

1495
01:46:41,462 --> 01:46:43,095
Well, give it to me!

1496
01:46:46,266 --> 01:46:49,101
I want you to
deliver this.

1497
01:46:49,136 --> 01:46:52,104
And I want you
to wake him up
if you have to.

1498
01:46:53,474 --> 01:46:55,107
Aye, aye, sir.

1499
01:46:56,076 --> 01:46:57,109
Go!

1500
01:47:11,592 --> 01:47:14,460
Charlie, come look at this.

1501
01:47:14,495 --> 01:47:18,030
Somebody get
Donovan down here.
It's Commander Farrell.

1502
01:48:00,641 --> 01:48:03,008
A lot of people
are looking for you.

1503
01:48:05,979 --> 01:48:08,414
Then aren't you
the clever ones.

1504
01:48:21,194 --> 01:48:23,195
<i>When is he coming out</i>
<i>from behind there?</i>

1505
01:48:23,230 --> 01:48:24,997
<i>Perhaps when you've made</i>
<i>certain things clearer</i>
<i>to us.</i>

1506
01:48:25,032 --> 01:48:26,565
<i>Well, then,</i>
<i>let's just get to the...</i>

1507
01:48:26,600 --> 01:48:29,334
<i>We want to know</i>
<i>what is...</i>

1508
01:48:29,369 --> 01:48:32,504
You would've known before!

1509
01:48:32,539 --> 01:48:35,307
I told you when I called
that I could not get out
of the Pentagon.

1510
01:48:35,342 --> 01:48:38,810
All right, but at least you'll
admit your relationship with
the woman was poorly handled.

1511
01:48:38,845 --> 01:48:41,513
I did what I was told!
You wanted me to be her
lover, I was her lover.

1512
01:48:41,548 --> 01:48:42,581
I don't see any point
in going on with this!

1513
01:48:42,616 --> 01:48:44,616
Yeah, well,
neither do I!

1514
01:48:59,733 --> 01:49:01,200
It's been very long for me.

1515
01:49:05,405 --> 01:49:10,108
Evgeni Alekseevich,
wouldn't you love to
hear Russian again?

1516
01:49:10,143 --> 01:49:13,679
Imagine Pushkin,
Lermontov, Tolstoy.

1517
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:15,614
Solzhenitsyn, Aksenov.

1518
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:19,785
Even then,
always the sense of humor.

1519
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:24,590
In the Philippines, when you
passed the bag of underwear,
Moscow wasn't amused.

1520
01:49:24,625 --> 01:49:27,626
I should have acted then.

1521
01:49:27,661 --> 01:49:31,363
In any case,
it's not possible for
you to remain United States.

1522
01:49:31,398 --> 01:49:34,633
This bizarre incident
has given them their
Yuri.

1523
01:49:34,668 --> 01:49:38,370
Evgeni, think, think.

1524
01:49:38,405 --> 01:49:39,471
You're a hero
of the Soviet Union.

1525
01:49:39,506 --> 01:49:40,639
I'm not a hero.

1526
01:49:40,674 --> 01:49:42,641
Be that as it may,
you must return.

1527
01:49:42,676 --> 01:49:46,078
I came here.
I thought I owed you that,

1528
01:49:46,113 --> 01:49:48,447
but you can't make me go back.

1529
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:54,853
