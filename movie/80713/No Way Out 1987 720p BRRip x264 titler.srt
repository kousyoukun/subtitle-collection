1
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,227
No more.

2
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:02,116
Is that supposed
to scare me?

3
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,827
- Don't be a wiseass!
- Just take it easy.

4
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:07,997
Commander Farrell's trying
to lay it out for us.

5
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,124
Why don't you two guys
just knock it off.

6
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,669
How did you actually meet
the Secretary of Defense?

7
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:22,678
I was introduced to him by Pritchard.
I met him when I was in college.

8
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,223
- Pritchard?
- Yeah, Scott Pritchard!

9
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:26,807
Jesus.

10
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,143
General Counsel for
the Secretary of Defense.

11
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,146
You got it? Is that good enough?
Look, you know this already.

12
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,661
When's he gonna come
out from behind here?

13
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:49,914
- Yes, sir.
- Got it.

14
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:56,796
Good evening, sir.

15
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:00,967
Get that limo out of here.

16
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,386
- Hi.
- Move that car.

17
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,522
Thank you.

18
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:26,993
Lucky it's not a bullshit detector
or else none of us would get in.

19
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:45,678
- How are you, Scott?
- Hi, Tom. How are you?

20
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,138
- Fine.
- You look great.

21
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,348
Thank you. Thank you.
And thank you for the invitation.

22
00:05:49,558 --> 00:05:52,101
I'm not used to hanging
out in places like this.

23
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:56,731
But I suspect you'd like to.
I take it you'd like to join our staff.

24
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,483
That was the purpose
of the note, wasn't it?

25
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,819
Well it wasn't a note,
it was a Christmas card.

26
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:05,114
And as I recall, the message was:
"Merry Christmas. "

27
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,283
Yes, thank you very much.

28
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,410
David, Scott is here.

29
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:12,538
Come on. I want to introduce
you to someone.

30
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,459
- Hello.
- Scott, how nice to see you.

31
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:19,003
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.

32
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,005
- Scott, how are you?
- Hello.

33
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,300
Secretary Bryce, this is Commander
Farrell, the officer I mentioned.

34
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:27,720
You'll recall he's had experience on
the joint staff and naval intelligence.

35
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:28,888
Pleased to meet you, sir.

36
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:32,266
Everyone I know is looking forward to
serving under you for another term.

37
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:34,602
You must have a very
limited acquaintanceship.

38
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:38,230
- Tom and I were in college together.
- Good.

39
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,108
He has great warmth.

40
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,236
- He's a genius.
- Oh?

41
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,113
The normal rules don't apply.

42
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:50,868
You know, some people think
you're really the brains.

43
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:53,079
Do they?

44
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:57,875
Is that supposed to flatter me?
He's the most extraordinary

45
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,418
person I've ever met in my life.

46
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:01,962
If it came to it,
I'd lay down my life for him.

47
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,131
Is that a job requirement?

48
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,245
Ladies and gentlemen,
it certainly was fantastic having

49
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,788
the President here this evening.

50
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,208
And I'm sure you'll all agree we can
look forward to a fine four years.

51
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,212
So let's continue to keep our inaugural
hair down with some more music.

52
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:46,173
Let's do it right now.
All right? Come on.

53
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,426
Yeah.
All right.

54
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,127
If you want to look down my dress,
you should grow a few inches.

55
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:31,427
- Wanna dance?
- The twist? No, thank you.

56
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,555
Well, we don't
have to twist.

57
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:37,683
- No meant no.
- "No" wasn't a figure of speech?

58
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:39,310
No.

59
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:43,522
- You're pretty impressed with me.
- No.

60
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,317
Yes, you are.

61
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:54,200
Stoli, straight up.

62
00:08:58,663 --> 00:09:00,915
So I was impressed.

63
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,875
- Yeah. Want a drink?
- Same.

64
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,543
Make it two.

65
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,670
You one of them?

66
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,342
- One of who?
- These hypocrites, all fat and shiny

67
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:14,303
gearing up for another four years
of ramming it to the rest of us.

68
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,805
- Are you one of them?
- No.

69
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:19,016
I'll bet you are.

70
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,436
You're pretty cynical.

71
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:25,856
Adequate to the occasion.

72
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,865
We have a potential nausea
situation building here.

73
00:09:38,662 --> 00:09:43,582
- Let's get out of here.
- My date's not gonna like that much.

74
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,252
But what the hell.

75
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,170
His wife will be delighted.

76
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:52,508
Is this something
we should talk about?

77
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,177
Nope.

78
00:10:00,684 --> 00:10:03,894
- Where would you like to go?
- Show us the monuments.

79
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,384
- What's your name?
- Bill.

80
00:11:18,053 --> 00:11:21,221
How you doing, Bill?
You wanna shut the slide?

81
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,266
- Sure.
- Sorry, Bill.

82
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,971
My name's Tom.

83
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,602
I'm Susan.

84
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,984
We're here.

85
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:02,865
- Is this your apartment?
- No, no.

86
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,200
I have a key to my apartment.

87
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,953
- It better be good.
- We need your bed.

88
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,623
Nina, Tom. Tom, Nina.
There's a limousine downstairs, okay.

89
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,252
There's booze in my pantry,
the refrigerator's full of food.

90
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:18,297
Susan, why don't you
go to your own place?

91
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:21,633
Because it's just one of those things.
Be a friend, alright?

92
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:26,597
If anybody calls, then just tell them
I died or that I'm asleep, all right?

93
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,724
- He won't call.
- I'll think of something.

94
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,809
- Here are the keys to my apartment.
- I gotta change.

95
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,812
Everything you need is in the
back seat of the car, okay?

96
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,690
- You didn't do it.
- Hey, now, you better beat it

97
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:38,859
before I get arrested.

98
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:42,738
- Bye, Nina.
- Oh, nice meeting you, Tom.

99
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,742
Nice to meet you, Nina.

100
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:48,452
Move it.

101
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:54,458
- Get it out of here.
- Okay, asshole.

102
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:56,877
Hey, come on folks.
Hey, come on, break it up.

103
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:59,505
I gotta make a living.
Can we move it along?

104
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:02,174
The white zone is for loading
and unloading passengers only.

105
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:03,759
No parking.

106
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,107
Take care of yourself.

107
00:14:20,068 --> 00:14:22,945
Send postcards from
exotic ports of call.

108
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:26,865
That's what you call them, isn't it?
Exotic ports of call?

109
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:28,534
A port's a port.

110
00:14:29,744 --> 00:14:31,119
You're exotic.

111
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,252
Bye.

112
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,662
Morning, Tommy. A little bit
early to be relieving me.

113
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,747
Well, I felt our motion change.

114
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,545
- Have we set a forward lookout in this?
- Yeah. Standing orders.

115
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:26,300
Maybe you should inform the captain
that the foredeck's shipping water.

116
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,635
Right. Do you wanna be the
one to wake him up?

117
00:15:28,887 --> 00:15:30,596
The fleet radioed,
we got a Russian sub out there.

118
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:32,848
We're supposed to catch
up and stay with it.

119
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,604
Great. Give us a chance to
try out the depth charges.

120
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,939
Yeah, that'll be the day.

121
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,399
The last one.

122
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:45,444
Forward watch is down!
Forward watch is down, sir!

123
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,113
Forward watch is down!
He's gonna be swept over, sir!

124
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,660
- Get the spot on him.
- Aye, sir.

125
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:55,120
- Where is he?
- There he is, there!

126
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:57,122
Hold on!

127
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,374
Has he got a safety line on?

128
00:16:00,168 --> 00:16:01,043
Tommy!

129
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,463
Sound the rescue party!
Sound the rescue party now!

130
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,551
Help!

131
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:13,555
Send the special rescue detail.
Forward lookout down.

132
00:16:13,556 --> 00:16:15,807
Tommy, come back,
wait for the rescue party!

133
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,186
Send the special rescue detail.
Forward lookout down.

134
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,189
Shit.
Help me!

135
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,942
Tommy, you don't have
a safety line on!

136
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:29,154
- Keep the light on him.
- I'm trying, sir!

137
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,134
Tommy!

138
00:16:57,976 --> 00:16:59,977
Keep the light on him!

139
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:03,438
- It's too windy, sir!
- Hold on!

140
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:06,191
Don't let him out of your sight.
Jesus!

141
00:17:17,996 --> 00:17:19,955
Help me.

142
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,640
Hurry!

143
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,525
He's got him.
He's got him!

144
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:51,611
- We got him!
- Great!

145
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:18,388
You've seen the leak
on the budget cuts?

146
00:18:18,389 --> 00:18:20,432
I've read the papers.
You're late.

147
00:18:20,433 --> 00:18:23,477
- I was caught in traffic.
- You should allow for that. I do.

148
00:18:23,478 --> 00:18:27,731
I've redlined the relevant sections
and my synopsis is at the end.

149
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:30,567
Order breakfast. It's the most
important meal of the day.

150
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,402
You should take
better care of yourself.

151
00:18:33,321 --> 00:18:36,114
- Menu, sir.
- Five years, 2 billion dollars.

152
00:18:36,324 --> 00:18:38,575
Gulf maritime can't even
get the prototype to float.

153
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:44,289
The phantom sub is a sinkhole.
I'm not putting another dime into it.

154
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,499
You're right, of course.

155
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,293
But what about the Armed
Services Committee? Duvall?

156
00:18:48,503 --> 00:18:50,754
One thing I'm looking forward
to in this next four years

157
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:53,340
is putting that fraud
Duvall in his place.

158
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,635
He's right back there.

159
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:59,346
I know.
Let's go.

160
00:19:04,936 --> 00:19:06,144
Oh, hi.

161
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,480
Mr. Secretary Brice.
Good morning.

162
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,024
- Senator, how are you?
- Mr. Secretary.

163
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,985
We've just been having a little
discussion here about that piece

164
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:15,445
on the budget in the paper.

165
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:17,823
- Did you read it, sir?
- No, I haven't read the papers.

166
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:20,492
- Scott was mentioning it.
- Mr. Pritchard.

167
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:24,412
Where in heaven's name
do they get their information?

168
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,666
And that idea about cutting
back on the phantom sub?

169
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,917
It's essentially groundless.

170
00:19:29,127 --> 00:19:30,877
As a matter of fact, we were just
going over our options on that.

171
00:19:31,087 --> 00:19:33,839
Talking to Mr. Marshall here,
he tells me those Soviets

172
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,800
are doing things with submarines
that will turn your hair white.

173
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,303
Senator, you can rest assured I have
no intention of making a decision

174
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,765
on this without consulting
you first. Good day.

175
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,643
Good day, senator.

176
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:53,692
You believe that?

177
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:55,944
No.

178
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,657
The car, please.

179
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,953
That business with Marshall,
he was telling us that if we fight him,

180
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,204
he'll have the CIA on his side.

181
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,665
Of course. He pushed
Marshall for the directorship.

182
00:20:09,876 --> 00:20:12,335
Scott, I'm sorry. Sometimes I'm
short with you, I apologize.

183
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,505
- That's not necessary.
- Several months ago you introduced

184
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:18,049
me to a friend of yours.
An officer. Uh...

185
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,342
- Commander Farrell?
- Right.

186
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,511
I understand he has a
background in intelligence?

187
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,388
He has two tours
with naval intelligence.

188
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,473
We could use a hero.
Get him here, will you?

189
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:30,604
- His ship's in Manila.
- Just do it, please.

190
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:36,818
No, no, no. You want...
Come here. You want a real hero.

191
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,197
- You know you want to do it!
- Come on.

192
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,993
- Try to remember you're an officer.
- You're making it hard on me.

193
00:20:44,994 --> 00:20:47,621
You're making it hard on me.
They're gonna be there all day.

194
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:50,165
- You know what I'm talking about, man.
- What's that?

195
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,500
- You deserve the damn medal.
- I carry?

196
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,127
If you jump me for promotion,
I'll kill you.

197
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,004
I'll kill your family,
I'll kill your pig.

198
00:20:56,214 --> 00:20:58,215
- I carry.
- What? You carry me?

199
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:02,844
- No, I speak Filipino. Beat it, kid.
- He's gotta make a living. Don't run.

200
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:03,929
He's gonna run.

201
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:06,473
If you run, I knock dog
doo doo out of you.

202
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,141
He's running!

203
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,520
Kid!

204
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,648
John, forget it!

205
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,443
No, let him go.
Let him go.

206
00:21:18,444 --> 00:21:22,280
So what? He's got a toothbrush,
a pair of skivvies. So what?

207
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,074
Okay.
So, what do we do now?

208
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:28,495
I don't know. I thought
I'd go buy some ashtrays

209
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:31,665
and take in some of
the local folk dancing.

210
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:34,000
- Folk dancing?
- Yeah, folk dancing.

211
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,637
No, person-to-person.

212
00:21:45,638 --> 00:21:49,182
You know, when you only pay
if you talk to the person?

213
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,518
Shut up! Just shut up!
No, not you.

214
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,895
- Groovy!
- No, I will pay.

215
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:58,900
- First, I have to know if she's there.
- One, two, three, yeah!

216
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:05,907
If I'm going to count out a million pesos,
I need to know if she's there.

217
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:07,200
Yeah.

218
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:13,164
That's my money. That's my money.
Go get it. Go get it.

219
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:19,629
No, no, I'm not joking.
I'm an American.

220
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,051
Hello?

221
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:28,305
Yes. Connect. I'll take it.
I'm putting my money in now.

222
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,517
Susan?
Hello, Susan?

223
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,979
Was I just...?

224
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,774
Was I just disconnected?
Why? Why?

225
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:41,901
I'm gonna show them
how an American

226
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:45,822
plants the flag in a
foreign fucking land!

227
00:22:45,823 --> 00:22:47,699
Yeah!

228
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,955
Can I get a beer, please?
I'd like another beer.

229
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,207
Wild thing!

230
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,555
You're beautiful.

231
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,575
- Hey, thanks.
- Keep it. Thank you.

232
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,050
Hello, Tom!
Welcome back.

233
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,052
I have some mail for you.
Come in. Come in.

234
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:57,268
The Philippines a romantic place, huh?
I painted a new painting.

235
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,188
Christmas in New England.

236
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,315
It's beautiful.

237
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,775
You really like it?

238
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,736
Well, it's unfinished.

239
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,613
Will you be with
us for a while?

240
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:13,952
Yes, I'll be working in the
Pentagon again. Thank you.

241
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,496
Great, wonderful. It's always
a pleasure to have you back.

242
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,583
Oh, my God!

243
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,211
Hello.

244
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:26,714
The Ancient Mariner.

245
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,633
Not so ancient.

246
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,349
I'm wasted!

247
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,977
I can see.

248
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,857
Wow, I'm so happy
to see you!

249
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:46,317
When did you get back?
Why didn't you call me?

250
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,027
- I did call you.
- I wrote you.

251
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:48,987
You did?

252
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,157
Yeah, but I'm semiliterate,
so it was wastebasket time.

253
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,701
If you caught gonorrhea,
I'll kill you.

254
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,920
I'm wearing too
many clothes.

255
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,922
It doesn't feel like you're
wearing anything.

256
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,468
Talk about feeling like
it's not wearing anything.

257
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,391
- Oh. Oh, you're gonna blush.
- You are a very bad girl.

258
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:19,934
Hold it.

259
00:25:20,686 --> 00:25:22,479
I mean the blush.

260
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:25,648
God, I'm so embarrassed.

261
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:28,485
What are you doing?

262
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:30,737
- I want to get a picture of this.
- No, no pictures!

263
00:25:30,738 --> 00:25:33,531
Naval hero blushes.
Come on, Farrell. You're proud.

264
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:36,868
No, I'm not proud.
I'm serious.

265
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:41,164
- Don't take a picture of me, please.
- Come on.

266
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:44,918
- Give me that.
- You jiggled the camera.

267
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:48,630
You pervert.

268
00:25:57,348 --> 00:26:00,767
I think I did this
way too early.

269
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:04,562
It looks like a baboon
in a closet at midnight.

270
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,183
Good morning, Mr. Pritchard.
Go right in.

271
00:26:42,184 --> 00:26:45,144
- May I take your hat, sir?
- Thank you.

272
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,859
Commander.

273
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:56,364
- Glad to have you with us.
- It's nice to be here. Thank you, sir.

274
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,741
Scott has a very
high opinion of you.

275
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,703
- Are you familiar with
your new duties? - No, sir.

276
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,707
Well then, this meeting
is premature, isn't it?

277
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,084
Tom only arrived in
Washington yesterday, sir.

278
00:27:08,085 --> 00:27:10,628
Well, since you're here.

279
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:14,424
As my assistant, you'll function
as liaison, under Scott's supervision

280
00:27:14,425 --> 00:27:17,427
between this office and
the intelligence community.

281
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:21,973
Calling that collection of piranhas a
"community" is one of life's ironies.

282
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:25,518
You'll meet regularly with a
representative from each of the agencies.

283
00:27:25,519 --> 00:27:28,730
For now, I am primarily
concerned with the CIA.

284
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,567
- Sir? - Are you aware of
the phantom submarine?

285
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,403
- Yes, sir.
- Have a seat.

286
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:37,488
Thank you.

287
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,283
The phantom submarine is
supposed to be invisible to sonar.

288
00:27:40,284 --> 00:27:42,744
Naturally the builder's
first instinct...

289
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:47,081
I should say his second instinct.
His first being to get his snout

290
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,126
as deeply as possible
into the public trough.

291
00:27:50,127 --> 00:27:54,881
They want to build a submarine roughly
the size of an aircraft carrier.

292
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:56,758
The Russians won't
need sonar to find it,

293
00:27:56,759 --> 00:27:59,552
they'll just see this huge
bulge out in the ocean.

294
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,721
It's my plan to
terminate this program.

295
00:28:01,722 --> 00:28:04,557
There's gonna be considerable
congressional resistance

296
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:08,394
principally from Senator Duvall.
Excuse me. Scott.

297
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,147
What's worrying is
his connection to the CIA.

298
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:14,484
We can expect them to feed
him with inflated estimates

299
00:28:14,485 --> 00:28:16,444
of Soviet research in the field.

300
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,695
In order to counter him,

301
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,614
we'll have to have access
to the same information.

302
00:28:19,615 --> 00:28:21,115
Not some self-serving gloss,

303
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,826
but the raw data that they
base their conclusions on.

304
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:26,329
- Your job is to get it.
- Yes, sir.

305
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:29,707
But raw data from the CIA.
My experience...

306
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,584
They'll either give
it to us or they won't.

307
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:33,336
If they do,
it will prove I'm correct.

308
00:28:33,337 --> 00:28:36,798
If they do not, I will use that fact
against them with the President.

309
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:39,342
You realize, of course,
I'm speaking in complete candor.

310
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:40,259
Yes, sir.

311
00:28:41,303 --> 00:28:43,388
Senator Duvall.

312
00:28:44,473 --> 00:28:49,560
Senator Duvall is motivated
by this absurd lust... Sit down.

313
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,771
This absurd lust for power.

314
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:55,149
This would be comic if it wasn't
so damn dangerous.

315
00:28:55,150 --> 00:29:00,154
Marshall at the CIA is his...
creature.

316
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:03,783
You, as a career officer, are above
this kind of political unpleasantness.

317
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,535
- That's why I chose you.
- Yes, sir.

318
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,329
Now you go with Scott and acquaint
yourself with the background material.

319
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,288
Yes, sir.

320
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:11,124
Commander,
let's cut the protocol.

321
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,333
In the absence of a demurral,

322
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:15,378
I'll assume all your responses
are in the affirmative.

323
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,591
Lorraine, get my wife
on the phone, please.

324
00:29:22,219 --> 00:29:24,595
I think he likes you.

325
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,641
Okay,
this is the situation room.

326
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,270
And right this way, sir,
is the computer center.

327
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:39,152
Did I mention, sir, I am very
pleased to be working for you?

328
00:29:39,153 --> 00:29:42,780
This is a Sperry 90/80, and all
the terminals in this room are for it.

329
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,325
It interfaces with the IBM 370s
at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade.

330
00:29:46,326 --> 00:29:48,494
Principally it works programs
for Comsec, SIGINT

331
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:51,664
the personnel command,
the Bureau of Alcohol and Fire...

332
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,832
I get your gist.

333
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,042
That's Dr. Hesselman,
the systems analyst.

334
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,128
- Let me introduce you...
- I know who it is. Sam Hesselman.

335
00:29:57,838 --> 00:29:59,172
It's good to see you.

336
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:01,549
Why didn't you call me
when you got into town?

337
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,677
- I don't know. Why didn't we call?
- Sir?

338
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,098
It's good to see you, Tom.
You look great.

339
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,391
Come on in the office.

340
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,311
- Mr. Fox, take a break.
- Yes, sir.

341
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,687
Are you back for good?

342
00:30:14,688 --> 00:30:16,898
I don't know about "for good,"
but I'm stationed here again.

343
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:18,191
How the hell are you?

344
00:30:18,192 --> 00:30:19,358
Can't complain.

345
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,195
- Helen and the kids asked
about you. - Good.

346
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,364
The kids loved the ashtray.

347
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,074
They didn't know
a donkey could do that.

348
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,369
Come on.

349
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:38,377
Tom, this is Kevin O'Brien.

350
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,547
CIA. I've explained that
you're taking over liaison.

351
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,341
Kevin will be your contact.

352
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,592
It's good to meet you, Farrell.

353
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,220
If there's anything I can do to
help you settle in, let me know.

354
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:50,807
Right now I'm just getting my
feet wet, trying to catch up.

355
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:52,350
I assumed that
because you didn't

356
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:54,268
want to wait until
the regular meeting...

357
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,772
I'm certain there are questions
that Commander Farrell must have.

358
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,983
No, I'm not sufficiently
prepared to ask anything.

359
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,402
I wouldn't want to
waste your time.

360
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:06,072
Well then, gentlemen,
if you'll excuse me.

361
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,865
You know, maybe there
is one thing, Kevin.

362
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:11,536
The Secretary asked me to help
him prepare for the NATO meeting

363
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:15,122
and I'd like to familiarize myself
with Russian intelligence estimates.

364
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,125
We submit a report on
the first of the month.

365
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:22,213
It'd be a big help if you could
send what you have as of now.

366
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:23,881
Sure, I'll have them put
something together for you.

367
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:27,426
- Thanks. I'd appreciate it very much.
- Don't mention it.

368
00:31:32,474 --> 00:31:36,978
That was deftly handled.
For a moment there, I thought...

369
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:41,357
Just trying to be subtle.
That's my job, isn't it?

370
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:04,088
- What is this, a present?
- Yeah.

371
00:32:05,215 --> 00:32:07,216
- He gave it to me.
- He did?

372
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:10,219
He has expensive taste,
this guy.

373
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,722
Didn't cost anything.

374
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:15,433
Some foreign minister
gave it to him.

375
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:18,895
So in other words,
we're dealing here with a guy

376
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:21,814
foreign ministers
give presents to?

377
00:32:21,815 --> 00:32:23,816
Don't start that stuff.

378
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,193
I didn't say anything.

379
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,571
You don't have
to say anything.

380
00:32:28,572 --> 00:32:30,698
You never say a word.

381
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:34,368
Well, I thought
I wasn't supposed to.

382
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,162
You know what I mean.

383
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:40,249
You get that wounded,
disapproving look on your face.

384
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,086
Ask me a question,
I'll answer it.

385
00:32:51,762 --> 00:32:55,890
It's David Brice,
Secretary of Defense. Satisfied?

386
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,939
You know I work for Brice?

387
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,359
Then that makes two of us.

388
00:33:08,946 --> 00:33:11,405
- Did you take care of everything?
- Yes.

389
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:16,160
I'm supposed to pick Miss Atwell
up at 8:00, if she remembers.

390
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,330
- You don't approve of Susan, do you?
- Sir?

391
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,458
She's a very bright
and exciting woman.

392
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,960
Can't you understand that?

393
00:33:23,961 --> 00:33:26,253
Not exactly, I guess.

394
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:30,508
All right.
I'm a pain in the ass.

395
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:34,136
But this one can do things for me
like no other woman I've ever met.

396
00:33:37,182 --> 00:33:40,101
It's the only other
thing worth living for.

397
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:47,066
Goddamn, what is the
big deal about tonight?

398
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:49,527
He likes to see me in public.

399
00:33:49,528 --> 00:33:51,988
So, what does he get,
a secret hard-on?

400
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:53,990
Try and understand.

401
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:58,911
- I'll call you later tonight.
- I'll wait by the phone.

402
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,878
- Hello, Scott.
- Hello, Miss Atwell.

403
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,801
- Two white wines, please.
- Mr. Brice.

404
00:34:56,970 --> 00:35:02,183
Mr. Marshall and I have been having
a little debate on government service.

405
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:05,978
Now, I claim that the fellow
with the appointed job

406
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:09,982
well, he sort of comes
and he goes at the pleasure

407
00:35:09,983 --> 00:35:13,903
of this or that administration.
He sort of blows in the wind.

408
00:35:13,904 --> 00:35:19,325
Whereas, the elected official,
well, he serves the people directly.

409
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:22,369
He has to be more responsible.

410
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,872
What do you think,
Mr. Secretary?

411
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:29,251
Senator Duvall,
I think it's getting very late.

412
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,676
- Oh, yes. Thanks.
- Thank you.

413
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,981
Who's that man licking Duvall's ear?
I recognize him.

414
00:35:50,982 --> 00:35:55,653
I would hope so. That's Marshall.
He's the director of the CIA.

415
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:57,655
You would hope so.

416
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:09,166
No, thank you.

417
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:24,348
Commander.

418
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:27,726
- So nice you could make it.
- Thank you, sir.

419
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:40,364
Ladies and gentlemen.
Ladies and gentlemen.

420
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:44,827
It's very good of you to come and
help us celebrate our national day.

421
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:48,956
After all, we're a small country,
far away.

422
00:36:48,957 --> 00:36:51,125
We've got a little entertainment
for you this evening

423
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:53,669
which I'm sure you're
going to enjoy.

424
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,346
I'll be right back.

425
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:41,300
- Hi.
- Hi.

426
00:37:41,301 --> 00:37:43,219
You're going away?

427
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:47,431
- Just for the weekend.
- Perhaps a romantic interlude, yes?

428
00:37:48,308 --> 00:37:49,516
Perhaps.

429
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,771
If I intrude on your privacy,
for this I am sorry.

430
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:57,191
It's not just a job,
it's an adventure.

431
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,131
What are you eating?

432
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,717
- You're eating bugs?
- I gotta have another one.

433
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:30,349
- Here you go.
- That is really disgusting.

434
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:39,566
I love Tom Farrell!

435
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:44,071
Yes, I do! Yes, I do!
Yes, I do!

436
00:38:44,072 --> 00:38:45,739
Hold on!
Whoo!

437
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:01,630
Thank you.

438
00:39:12,017 --> 00:39:13,058
Thank you very much, sir.

439
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:14,601
I want you to take
care of us, okay?

440
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,437
I will.
You guys newlyweds?

441
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:19,231
- You can go.
- Thank you.

442
00:39:20,734 --> 00:39:22,735
You're beautiful.

443
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:25,321
- Mr. and Mrs. Smith?
- A romantic gesture.

444
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:29,867
How very original.

445
00:39:29,868 --> 00:39:32,369
I spelled it with a Y.

446
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,007
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

447
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,010
We want to rent a boat.

448
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:51,138
Twenty bucks an hour.
Take your pick.

449
00:39:51,139 --> 00:39:53,891
That's all right, but we don't
want a plastic toy.

450
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,851
We want something like this.

451
00:39:55,852 --> 00:39:57,936
- No, no.
- Why not?

452
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,898
That's my boss's boat.
It ain't for rent.

453
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,524
Well, I want it.

454
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:07,196
Don't do this.

455
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:10,366
You're bad. Listen, do you really
know what you're doing?

456
00:40:10,367 --> 00:40:14,328
I mean, it's gusting like a son
of a bitch out there. One more.

457
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,886
God, I wish the Navy
were still like this.

458
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,809
Let's get ready,
we'll come about.

459
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,983
- Give me a kiss.
- Okay, hold the fort.

460
00:40:45,735 --> 00:40:48,362
We're gonna come over here.
Let me get it off.

461
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:50,406
- Ready?
- No, not yet.

462
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,909
- Okay, whenever you are.
- Okay, I'm ready.

463
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:56,328
- Say, "Helms alee. "
- Helms alee!

464
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,330
Very tight.

465
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:44,793
Hello?

466
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:47,129
Oh, hi, Nina.

467
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,715
Tom and I just got
back this minute.

468
00:41:53,136 --> 00:41:54,678
Okay.

469
00:41:55,722 --> 00:41:57,222
Yeah.

470
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,100
Can I call you later?

471
00:42:00,894 --> 00:42:02,269
Okay.

472
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:06,523
Bye.

473
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,777
Well, it didn't take
him long, did it?

474
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,281
That was Nina, so don't.

475
00:42:15,283 --> 00:42:16,617
Don't what?

476
00:42:56,950 --> 00:42:58,534
Oh, no.

477
00:42:58,535 --> 00:43:02,037
Tom, David's here.
Oh, my God.

478
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,833
I'm begging you, please.
Just go now, out the back door.

479
00:43:07,627 --> 00:43:09,253
I'm sorry.
Just...

480
00:43:09,254 --> 00:43:12,172
When I go, it'll be
through the front door.

481
00:43:13,216 --> 00:43:15,342
As a favor to me,
just this one time.

482
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:17,719
Please!
Please go!

483
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:21,515
I promise I'll work everything out.
All right?

484
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:24,184
Tom, please!

485
00:43:24,686 --> 00:43:28,230
Why don't you fucking go down
and beg him not to come in?

486
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,361
You want me to say it?
I'll say it.

487
00:43:37,198 --> 00:43:41,076
Tom. I'll leave him.
I promise, I will.

488
00:43:41,077 --> 00:43:43,161
I'll leave him.

489
00:43:43,997 --> 00:43:46,206
I love you.

490
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,634
You've been out of town.

491
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:43,722
And you have
a pleasant flush.

492
00:44:43,723 --> 00:44:46,558
- I got some sun.
- Oh, how nice.

493
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:49,227
- With whom did you get this sun?
- What?

494
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,856
What? I said, who were
you with this weekend?

495
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:55,359
Nobody.

496
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:01,531
I find that hard to believe,
that you'd go away completely alone.

497
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:03,533
I didn't say I was
completely alone.

498
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,744
I think you said you
weren't with anybody.

499
00:45:08,081 --> 00:45:10,123
I mean, nobody you know.

500
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,293
I know a great many people.

501
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:16,129
How can you be certain
it's somebody I don't know?

502
00:45:20,343 --> 00:45:22,219
You want a drink?

503
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,848
He's a man I know.

504
00:45:29,018 --> 00:45:31,395
It's of no importance.

505
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,776
I'm sure it's of no importance
to you whom you sleep with

506
00:45:37,777 --> 00:45:39,986
but it's of considerable
importance to me!

507
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,030
Why worry?
There's plenty left.

508
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:48,328
Get out of here, you bastard! Get out!
I'm calling the police. Get out!

509
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,372
I wanna know who it was.

510
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,629
Listen, goddamn it!
I pay the rent here.

511
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,715
Get out of here!

512
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:04,594
All right, wait.
Wait a minute.

513
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:06,847
I'm sorry I slapped you,
all right?

514
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:12,644
- No! Damn it!
- Listen!

515
00:46:13,563 --> 00:46:14,896
- You tell me...
- No!

516
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:18,775
- You tell me who it is!
- He's not a pig like you!

517
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:30,203
Susan!

518
00:46:46,012 --> 00:46:49,055
David, what's the matter?

519
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,898
I think I killed Susan.

520
00:47:01,444 --> 00:47:05,030
- What happened?
- I killed her.

521
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:11,787
I needed somebody to talk
to before I go to the police.

522
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:14,498
Sit down.
Sit down.

523
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:18,919
It was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

524
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:23,381
She was with some man,
and I just must've gone crazy.

525
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,094
The man was there?
He saw you?

526
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:34,643
He saw me go in, yeah.

527
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,103
Who is he?

528
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,274
It was dark.

529
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,361
Then maybe he
didn't see you.

530
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:49,366
I parked my car.
I stood under the light.

531
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,985
He saw me.

532
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,850
He saw me.

533
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:52,053
Hi. I can't come to
the phone right now

534
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:55,807
but when you hear the beep,
tell me everything.

535
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:15,452
- Did she ever photograph you?
- No.

536
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,499
This is the negative
side of a Polaroid.

537
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,251
I found it under the bed.

538
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,253
Are you absolutely certain?

539
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:27,339
I'm certain.
I'm not that big a fool.

540
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:31,551
Then we have to find
the man who saw you.

541
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:40,810
What if the search for this man
was of vital national security?

542
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:45,106
A secret operation
that we could control.

543
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,692
It won't hold up to scrutiny.

544
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:49,903
We'll invent an excuse for the
search that can be justified.

545
00:49:49,904 --> 00:49:54,032
The important thing is to abort
an investigation of Susan's death

546
00:49:54,033 --> 00:49:55,533
before it ever gets to you.

547
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:59,454
No. It's a house of cards.
There is no Yuri.

548
00:49:59,455 --> 00:50:02,749
It doesn't matter.
All the intelligence agencies

549
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:06,503
believe that there's a mole
in the defense department.

550
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:08,338
You know the theory.

551
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:12,425
That Yuri was sent here by
the KGB while he was in his teens

552
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:15,804
and for all intents and purposes,
he can pass as an American.

553
00:50:15,805 --> 00:50:18,014
Scott, they've been talking
about that for four years.

554
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,349
It's the CIA's wet dream.

555
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,142
There's never been
a shred of evidence.

556
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:24,104
But now there is.

557
00:50:24,355 --> 00:50:28,066
He was the man who spent
the weekend with Susan.

558
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:30,735
He was the man
who killed her.

559
00:50:36,659 --> 00:50:42,038
Lorraine, will you ask CID
to get all the material on Yuri

560
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:46,710
and bring it in to the Secretary
as soon as possible? Thank you.

561
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:51,965
- I don't think we can bring this off.
- You can.

562
00:50:58,097 --> 00:50:59,973
Excuse me.

563
00:51:03,102 --> 00:51:05,645
- Good morning, Major.
- Morning.

564
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,772
Thank you.

565
00:51:10,985 --> 00:51:16,156
If military intelligence can catch this
KGB agent without outside assistance

566
00:51:16,157 --> 00:51:19,409
it will measurably strengthen
us against the CIA. Thank you.

567
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:22,370
You understand that this
has to move like lightning.

568
00:51:22,371 --> 00:51:24,914
We have to finish before anyone
gets on to what we're doing.

569
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,250
I want you to assume
control of the investigation.

570
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:30,086
Responsibility is consonant
with your office.

571
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:33,757
I have implicit trust in you
to keep this under wraps.

572
00:51:33,758 --> 00:51:36,926
You're to report to me or
to Secretary Brice only.

573
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:40,513
- I plan to remain here around the clock.
- What do the Washington police know?

574
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,142
They haven't been informed. CID
has taken the body to Fort Meade.

575
00:51:46,187 --> 00:51:48,480
If we go looking for a
Russian spy without

576
00:51:48,481 --> 00:51:51,024
the FBI or the CIA in on it,
it's gonna raise hell.

577
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,692
That's my problem.

578
00:51:57,073 --> 00:52:00,033
Well what do we have
on the dead woman?

579
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:02,869
It's through Yuri's
association with

580
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:05,205
this woman that we'll
be able to find him.

581
00:52:05,206 --> 00:52:07,499
Here's everything we know
about her for the moment.

582
00:52:09,877 --> 00:52:12,462
It looks like he spent the
weekend with her somewhere.

583
00:52:12,463 --> 00:52:16,758
Then he brought her home and killed
her sometime around midnight.

584
00:52:16,759 --> 00:52:18,009
I'm counting on it
not being too hard

585
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:20,136
to find out
where they'd been.

586
00:52:28,437 --> 00:52:30,063
Tom?

587
00:52:31,107 --> 00:52:32,607
Yeah.
Yes.

588
00:52:32,608 --> 00:52:34,818
I'm certain the investigation
will develop more material‒

589
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,861
Will you excuse me?

590
00:52:37,947 --> 00:52:39,656
Commander Farrell,
are we boring you?

591
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:41,574
No, sir.
May I?

592
00:53:02,263 --> 00:53:04,806
We can't even convince our
own people for Christ sake.

593
00:53:04,807 --> 00:53:06,808
It's all right.

594
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,759
Get Donovan in here.

595
00:53:42,803 --> 00:53:44,387
Commander, if you please!

596
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,487
Commander?

597
00:54:03,616 --> 00:54:06,659
This is Major Donovan of the
Criminal Investigation Division.

598
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:09,746
His men will be conducting the
investigation subject to your orders.

599
00:54:09,747 --> 00:54:10,788
Major.

600
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,583
We're set up down in the
situation room, commander.

601
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:31,351
We have to have
a front man.

602
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,985
- They're autopsying the body now.
- I wanna see her apartment.

603
00:54:40,986 --> 00:54:42,654
I don't think that
will be necessary.

604
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:44,405
You may not think it's necessary,
but I want to see it.

605
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,075
- They're autopsying the body now.
- Good.

606
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:50,078
- Scott, I wanna see her apartment.
- Mr. Pritchard...

607
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,496
The CID men
will do a better job.

608
00:54:51,497 --> 00:54:53,206
It's more important
that you remain here.

609
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:56,125
I've got half a dozen men checking
for physical evidence right now.

610
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,962
- The print people are just back.
- What did they find?

611
00:54:58,963 --> 00:55:02,257
Fragments of smudge.
The place was clean.

612
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,801
You don't mind my asking,
what's going on?

613
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:07,470
A matter of the
utmost importance.

614
00:55:07,471 --> 00:55:08,554
What is this?

615
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,640
We're checking phone calls
made over the past week,

616
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:12,809
to see if the Atwell woman's
number comes up.

617
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,269
There's gotta be millions.

618
00:55:14,270 --> 00:55:16,980
We interface with the
phone company's computers.

619
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:20,400
We're monitoring every call
made in a 50-mile radius.

620
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:23,778
We're checking gas station,
restaurant and hotel credit card receipts.

621
00:55:23,779 --> 00:55:27,198
- Who is this bimbo anyway?
- She's dead.

622
00:55:29,076 --> 00:55:30,868
One billfold.

623
00:55:32,037 --> 00:55:32,870
Bracelets.

624
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,247
This is the evidence
from her house?

625
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,331
Yes, sir.

626
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:38,584
One box of candy mints.

627
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:44,507
Got one brown hairbrush.

628
00:55:52,224 --> 00:55:53,766
Commander Farrell
is on his way in,

629
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,561
and we should have a report on
the house-to-house pretty soon.

630
00:55:56,562 --> 00:55:59,188
- What's this?
- Polaroid negatives.

631
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:03,943
- I can't make anything out.
- Excuse me.

632
00:56:03,944 --> 00:56:06,237
If there's still any
silver on the emulsion,

633
00:56:06,238 --> 00:56:08,323
we may be able to
bring out the picture.

634
00:56:08,324 --> 00:56:12,035
Excuse me. Sergeant, get this
right over to the photo lab, huh?

635
00:56:13,162 --> 00:56:15,621
- Sir. Commander.
- Yes?

636
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,915
Mr. O'Brien's waiting for
you in your office.

637
00:56:17,916 --> 00:56:20,918
That's right, we made an appointment
to go over the CIA report.

638
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:24,797
- Just cancel it.
- If we do, he'll go away suspicious.

639
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,467
That's true.

640
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,932
Hello. I'll be in
Commander Farrell's office

641
00:56:35,142 --> 00:56:37,477
could you call me
in five minutes?

642
00:56:38,479 --> 00:56:40,563
Sorry it took so long.

643
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,359
- This is the official estimate.
- It's an advance copy.

644
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:47,028
I thought that was
what you wanted.

645
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,739
Pritchard here.

646
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:54,535
Yes, of course. I'm sorry,
I'm wanted in the Secretary's office.

647
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:57,705
I suggest that we
reschedule this meeting.

648
00:56:57,706 --> 00:57:00,875
Perhaps Commander Farrell
and I could continue.

649
00:57:00,876 --> 00:57:02,794
- Commander Farrell...
- That would be satisfactory.

650
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:05,046
We're both requested at
the Secretary's meeting.

651
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,547
I'm afraid we really must stop.

652
00:57:09,176 --> 00:57:13,971
Kevin, I was wondering if you might
help me in the counterespionage area.

653
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,265
Tom, we'd better
get to that meeting.

654
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,357
Commander, when you get
more time, you give me a call.

655
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:26,734
I can be reached
24 hours a day.

656
00:57:27,194 --> 00:57:28,569
Good.

657
00:57:31,323 --> 00:57:33,282
What was that supposed to be?

658
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:35,743
I thought I might get something
out of him about Yuri.

659
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:38,371
What we have will be
quite sufficient.

660
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:42,458
I want you to arrange that all
outgoing calls are monitored.

661
00:57:42,459 --> 00:57:43,584
All calls?

662
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:44,919
Don't worry,
Brice's lines are safe.

663
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,379
- I'll see to it.
- Do it now.

664
00:57:47,423 --> 00:57:49,298
- What's that?
- Autopsy report.

665
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:52,885
She died of a broken neck.
Here's a list of her stomach contents.

666
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,972
What the hell for?

667
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:58,599
There are different chemical
pollutants in food.

668
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:01,769
There's a chance we might pin
down where she ate her last day.

669
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,531
I want you to stay close
to the center of things,

670
00:58:13,532 --> 00:58:16,117
but you're to do nothing
until you're instructed by me.

671
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,328
- Who are these goons?
- They're associated with Special Forces.

672
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:22,081
I don't understand what that means.
What's that mean, "Associated"?

673
00:58:22,082 --> 00:58:24,417
That means exactly what I said.

674
00:58:24,418 --> 00:58:26,878
They were formerly in Special Forces
and now that are associated.

675
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,671
Where?
Honduras? El Salvador?

676
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:31,424
- Somewhere down there.
- Were you with the death squads?

677
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,925
They were with the
death squads there.

678
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:35,178
- It's possible.
- In other words they're assassins.

679
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:36,804
You needn't concern yourself.
They work for me now.

680
00:58:36,805 --> 00:58:38,431
Leave us, please!

681
00:58:49,151 --> 00:58:51,694
You haven't told
me everything.

682
00:59:02,456 --> 00:59:04,499
The Atwell woman knew Brice.

683
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,127
She was his mistress.

684
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,800
Naturally, Brice had no idea of her
connection with a Soviet agent.

685
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,512
We only found out last night,
after the murder.

686
00:59:17,513 --> 00:59:19,597
Well then Brice is in
an impossible situation.

687
00:59:19,598 --> 00:59:21,390
We should just call in the FBI.

688
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,351
Don't be an idiot.

689
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:28,105
Do you realize the magnitude
of the scandal?

690
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,650
The Secretary of Defense
and a Soviet agent

691
00:59:30,651 --> 00:59:33,653
sharing the favors
of a murdered whore.

692
00:59:33,654 --> 00:59:36,239
David might even be
a suspect in the killing.

693
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,616
Yeah, well I think that's
something to consider.

694
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,368
It isn't speculation, Tom.

695
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:43,079
Brice was with me in my apartment
at the time of the murder.

696
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,372
He couldn't possibly
have done it.

697
00:59:44,373 --> 00:59:47,124
Fine, fine, then let's call in the FBI
and let Brice take his chances.

698
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:51,921
That decision is not yours to make.
What we will do is catch this Yuri

699
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:54,048
ourselves before anyone
knows what's happened.

700
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,758
After we've got him,
we'll handle the rest of it.

701
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,343
You mean the
gentlemen in the next room.

702
00:59:57,344 --> 01:00:00,555
The man we're after is
a spy and a murderer.

703
01:00:00,556 --> 01:00:02,139
Would anyone deny
that justice had been done?

704
01:00:02,140 --> 01:00:03,683
Yeah, I would.

705
01:00:03,684 --> 01:00:06,602
Well we shall have that discussion
at the appropriate time, but for now

706
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,437
I expect you to
follow direct orders

707
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,982
and I expect you to
demonstrate the personal loyalty

708
01:00:10,983 --> 01:00:13,276
to which both the Secretary
and I have every right.

709
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:16,654
- You expect a lot.
- I depend on you. We're friends.

710
01:00:16,655 --> 01:00:20,074
And, Tom, if it were
your intention to do

711
01:00:20,075 --> 01:00:23,536
anything to bring
down David Brice

712
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:27,748
then I'd have no choice but to make
sure that you didn't get away with it.

713
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:32,086
- Thank you for the warning.
- I'm quite certain it's unnecessary.

714
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,879
When you calm down,
you'll see that we're following

715
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,715
the only possible course.

716
01:00:52,608 --> 01:00:56,402
I gave them the estimates.
They couldn't have cared less.

717
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:00,990
Get me Senator Duvall.

718
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,577
What's all this
top-secret business

719
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:06,454
I've been hearing about
over at the Pentagon?

720
01:01:06,455 --> 01:01:10,249
Here's what we do have.
CID is running a phone check.

721
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:13,711
They're looking for all calls
placed to a Susan Atwell.

722
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:15,087
Who is she?

723
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:18,799
She's in the morgue at Fort Meade.
She was murdered last night.

724
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,135
- We know anything about it?
- Get ready for this.

725
01:01:21,136 --> 01:01:25,806
We think she's either David Brice's
or Scott Pritchard's mistress.

726
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,892
She was seen
with both of them.

727
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,852
It didn't seem a
high-priority matter

728
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,647
so my people have been
a little lax in following it up.

729
01:01:32,898 --> 01:01:37,360
Well, spilt milk, and you can forget
about Pritchard. He's homosexual.

730
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,529
I'll be damned.

731
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:45,618
So will he, if you believe the
Old Testament. Who killed her?

732
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:49,705
We don't know. They got CID
believing they're searching for Yuri.

733
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,542
Don't tell me anybody
swallowed that.

734
01:01:54,878 --> 01:01:57,672
That poor son of a bitch Brice.

735
01:01:59,174 --> 01:02:01,384
You know,
I almost feel sorry for him.

736
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:05,888
- Who's running this at the Pentagon?
- The new boy, Farrell.

737
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,766
So he can take the fall in
case anything goes wrong.

738
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:11,310
This morning, he looked like a man
who'd like to have a heart-to-heart.

739
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:17,400
Yeah.
Senator Duvall.

740
01:02:18,652 --> 01:02:21,904
Listen Billy, I've been hearing
some very disturbing news

741
01:02:21,905 --> 01:02:23,656
about the phantom sub.

742
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,078
I tried to talk to the
President about NATO.

743
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:32,248
All he wanted to talk about
was the phantom submarine.

744
01:02:32,249 --> 01:02:34,834
Why the crunch on that has come now,
of all times, is beyond me.

745
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,335
We'll just have to handle it.

746
01:02:36,336 --> 01:02:38,671
You got me handling a
hell of a lot, haven't you?

747
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:43,551
Yeah?
Hold.

748
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,263
Commander,
line two, the other phone.

749
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,432
I'll call you back.

750
01:02:49,683 --> 01:02:51,559
Yeah?

751
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:55,187
I'll be right down.

752
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:56,814
They want me in
the computer center.

753
01:02:56,815 --> 01:02:58,482
I'll go with you.

754
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,486
Oh, yeah, by all means,
go with him.

755
01:03:06,074 --> 01:03:06,907
What is it, Sam?

756
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,701
Photo lab said there's
no more image

757
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,578
they can get out
of this Polaroid.

758
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:14,498
Damn, too much to hope for.
We'll just have to forget it.

759
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,376
Maybe not. There's something
I want to show you.

760
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,714
Now, this is as bad
as your Polaroid, right?

761
01:03:21,715 --> 01:03:25,801
Now watch. This is a training tape.
I'm speeding it up.

762
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:28,637
The original picture is
broken down into pixels.

763
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:31,015
That's the smallest element
on the emulsion.

764
01:03:31,016 --> 01:03:33,100
Sort of an atom
of the picture.

765
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:36,520
This is the good part.
The computer just asks itself:

766
01:03:36,521 --> 01:03:39,273
What would be next to what
if we played with the pixels?

767
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:41,066
That's all there is to it?

768
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:45,154
We have to keep on top of the computer.
Computers don't think.

769
01:03:45,405 --> 01:03:46,781
For example, if we had
programmed this to

770
01:03:46,782 --> 01:03:48,407
come out a car
instead of a monkey

771
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,702
well, right now, you'd be
looking at a hairy Buick.

772
01:03:53,163 --> 01:03:54,705
All right, then we'll just
get started on it.

773
01:03:54,706 --> 01:03:57,458
Wait a minute.
It takes billions of calculations.

774
01:03:57,459 --> 01:04:00,294
The whole process may take 12
hours or it may take a week.

775
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,254
Well, that's too long.

776
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:06,258
Perhaps you can get what you
need from the work in progress.

777
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,928
We'll be watching it
right on this screen.

778
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:12,264
We've got our first phone number,
it's listed to a Nina Beka.

779
01:04:12,265 --> 01:04:15,100
She called last night about
the time of the murder.

780
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:18,187
- I better see her.
- I was just about to send my men.

781
01:04:34,788 --> 01:04:36,831
Are you Miss Nina Beka?

782
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,208
Yes.

783
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,043
I'm Commander Farrell,
Miss Beka.

784
01:04:41,044 --> 01:04:42,628
This is Mr. Scott Pritchard,

785
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:45,005
general counsel to the
Secretary of Defense.

786
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:46,465
May we come in?

787
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:49,301
Please, do come in.

788
01:04:51,263 --> 01:04:54,598
I'm afraid that we have
some bad news for you.

789
01:04:57,602 --> 01:05:00,729
A woman named
Susan Atwell is dead.

790
01:05:04,568 --> 01:05:06,360
She was a friend of yours?

791
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:09,238
Yes, she is.

792
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:12,116
In what way were
you acquainted?

793
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:25,254
You see, I work at Shalini's
Boutique in the pavilion.

794
01:05:25,505 --> 01:05:28,215
She used to come
in there sometimes.

795
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:31,510
We'd like you to tell us as
much about her as possible.

796
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:34,930
We think she was killed by
a man she'd been seeing.

797
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,349
Why?

798
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:39,393
You needn't concern
yourself with why.

799
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:43,606
We just need to know the names
of the men that she consorted with.

800
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:46,317
- Consorted with?
- Yes.

801
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:50,112
I don't know anything
about Susan's personal life.

802
01:05:50,113 --> 01:05:53,157
I'll ask you again,
who were the men she saw?

803
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:55,951
Well you can ask me
a thousand times

804
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,954
and the answer will still
be the same: I don't know it.

805
01:06:00,916 --> 01:06:02,917
You're South African.

806
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:07,087
- That's right.
- I don't see a U.S. visa.

807
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,964
You're an illegal alien.

808
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,430
Do you know who I am?

809
01:06:17,057 --> 01:06:19,892
I can pick up that phone
and I can have you

810
01:06:19,893 --> 01:06:22,269
on the first plane
to Johannesburg.

811
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:24,813
I'm assuming you have a reason
for not wanting to be there.

812
01:06:29,277 --> 01:06:33,364
You guessed right.
I know who you are.

813
01:06:33,365 --> 01:06:37,785
I know who Brice is.
David Brice.

814
01:06:37,786 --> 01:06:39,370
Is that the name
you're looking for?

815
01:06:39,371 --> 01:06:42,122
We're not interested in him.
It's another man that we want.

816
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:48,087
Well, in that case,
why don't we make a deal?

817
01:06:48,088 --> 01:06:50,839
We'll talk about it.
Who is the other man?

818
01:06:55,762 --> 01:06:57,680
Who is the other man?

819
01:07:01,518 --> 01:07:04,144
It's someone at the Pentagon.

820
01:07:06,815 --> 01:07:11,026
- Does he have a name?
- I suppose so, but I don't know it.

821
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:13,654
Listen...

822
01:07:14,781 --> 01:07:20,452
all I know is that Susan used
to see him, and he reappeared.

823
01:07:20,453 --> 01:07:22,621
- How recently?
- I don't know.

824
01:07:22,622 --> 01:07:24,707
- Three months? Two?
- I don't know!

825
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,418
A month, three weeks. Who cares?
I don't know it.

826
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:31,130
Listen, she never discussed
these things with me.

827
01:07:31,131 --> 01:07:32,047
All right,
that will do for now.

828
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,049
We're going to close the part of
the investigation that concerns you.

829
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:35,467
Will that be satisfactory?

830
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,683
- Tom.
- Thank you, Miss Beka.

831
01:07:43,643 --> 01:07:45,394
You've been very helpful.

832
01:07:56,781 --> 01:07:58,741
Sam!

833
01:07:58,742 --> 01:08:00,993
I want the names of all
civilian and military personnel

834
01:08:00,994 --> 01:08:03,162
who have been assigned to the
Pentagon during the past two months.

835
01:08:03,163 --> 01:08:04,455
Can you do it?

836
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:05,581
It's all in the computer.

837
01:08:05,582 --> 01:08:07,458
I'll just have to set up
a program to find it.

838
01:08:07,459 --> 01:08:09,126
Mr. Pritchard.

839
01:08:09,127 --> 01:08:10,961
Tom, I've got a suggestion.

840
01:08:10,962 --> 01:08:13,589
We're doing this
credit card search

841
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:15,799
but it's extremely unlikely
that anything charged

842
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,760
over the weekend would
be turned in so soon.

843
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:20,220
We're wasting valuable computer
time that we could use better.

844
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:24,391
- I know. I want you to keep on with it.
- What's all this about, Tom?

845
01:08:24,392 --> 01:08:26,351
We'll talk later.
What've you got here, what is this?

846
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:27,811
I have to see Secretary Brice.

847
01:08:27,812 --> 01:08:30,105
Get started on that list of
new employees, would you?

848
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:35,736
Yeah, we isolated three pollutants
in the dead girl's stomach contents.

849
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:38,572
They're the red, green and
blue lines on the graph.

850
01:08:38,573 --> 01:08:42,743
If we can get the overlays to match,
we might pinpoint where she was.

851
01:08:43,286 --> 01:08:46,288
So far, it looks like somewhere
near upper Chesapeake Bay.

852
01:08:55,215 --> 01:08:56,840
Come in.

853
01:08:57,884 --> 01:09:00,469
Excuse me, sir, have you
seen Major Donovan?

854
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:01,303
No.

855
01:09:01,304 --> 01:09:03,806
Well, it's important
that I get this to him.

856
01:09:03,807 --> 01:09:08,644
- What do you have here?
- We missed it the first time around.

857
01:09:08,645 --> 01:09:11,313
It must have fallen
under the seat of her car.

858
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:13,774
I'll take care of this.

859
01:09:15,527 --> 01:09:17,444
Very well, sir.

860
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:23,742
Was this a present?

861
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:28,372
- Yeah, he gave it to me.
- He has expensive taste.

862
01:09:28,373 --> 01:09:31,792
It didn't cost him anything.
Some foreign minister gave it to him.

863
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:39,800
I pride myself on being a man
of forbearance and conciliation

864
01:09:39,801 --> 01:09:43,470
but if you fuck me on this,
I'll crucify you!

865
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,556
I am not your rubber stamp.

866
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,350
You have run roughshod over
this office for twenty years.

867
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:49,393
And that's over.

868
01:09:49,394 --> 01:09:52,896
Sir, you may disparage
your predecessors all you like

869
01:09:52,897 --> 01:09:56,316
but I don't recall in the past
any secret investigation

870
01:09:56,317 --> 01:09:58,861
that required the entire
Department of Defense

871
01:09:58,862 --> 01:10:03,407
circumvented CIA and the FBI
and the Washington police.

872
01:10:03,408 --> 01:10:07,202
Senator, we're not locked into
any position on the phantom sub.

873
01:10:07,203 --> 01:10:09,663
- What are you saying?
- I'm just trying to allay

874
01:10:09,914 --> 01:10:12,416
Senator Duvall's fears that
we might act peremptorily.

875
01:10:12,625 --> 01:10:15,002
We will act the way
I decide on this matter.

876
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:19,256
Gentlemen, I don't see any point
in squabbling like children.

877
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:24,636
Mr. Pritchard, I'm encouraged by your
attitude. I'm sure your investigation

878
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:28,265
whatever it is,
is perfectly proper.

879
01:10:28,266 --> 01:10:30,809
I must apologize for my
unseemly outburst.

880
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:33,520
It's just that I've been
sorely troubled.

881
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,939
That's perfectly
understandable, senator.

882
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,483
I'm certain that we can
reach an accommodation.

883
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:42,362
Gentlemen,
I'm deeply gratified.

884
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:46,158
Deeply gratified, and I hope
you'll forgive my imposition

885
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:48,827
on such a busy day.

886
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,465
- He's got us.
- This is insane. It's out of control.

887
01:11:01,716 --> 01:11:03,759
Your cover story's
not gonna hold water.

888
01:11:03,968 --> 01:11:07,888
Yes, it will, but you have to
have more moral courage.

889
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:19,441
Have you ever heard of a
woman named Nina Beka?

890
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:23,695
- No.
- Well, she's heard of you.

891
01:11:26,324 --> 01:11:29,326
Instruct the CIA to get in
touch with you at your home.

892
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:31,370
I want you to remain there
and wait for the information.

893
01:11:31,371 --> 01:11:34,039
You're not to call me.
I'll check in with you periodically.

894
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:34,915
Yes, sir.

895
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,251
- As quickly as possible.
- Okay.

896
01:11:43,925 --> 01:11:46,635
Hey!
You two!

897
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:53,267
Scott, where are they going?

898
01:11:53,268 --> 01:11:54,768
Laurel and Hardy,
where are they going?

899
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:55,769
Who's that, Tom?

900
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:59,398
- You know who I mean, the bookends.
- I sent them on an errand.

901
01:12:02,485 --> 01:12:05,487
Tom. Tom. Tom!

902
01:12:05,488 --> 01:12:07,281
Yes, sir, I'll...

903
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:10,909
I need a car,
it's an emergency.

904
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,369
I'm sorry commander,
CID's got everything.

905
01:12:12,370 --> 01:12:13,829
This one.
Bring this one down.

906
01:12:13,830 --> 01:12:15,455
You can't take that,
the lift is busted.

907
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:18,041
- The man's gonna fix it.
- Watch your toes.

908
01:12:18,042 --> 01:12:21,378
Come on! Get out of there!
Get outta there right now!

909
01:12:37,145 --> 01:12:39,563
Shit.

910
01:13:10,762 --> 01:13:12,888
- Shit.
- Hi.

911
01:13:22,148 --> 01:13:25,525
- Goddamn it, get him!
- Come on, hurry up!

912
01:13:26,986 --> 01:13:29,863
Hey, what are you doing?
Are you crazy?

913
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:40,142
Hey, you okay?

914
01:15:12,842 --> 01:15:14,926
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, slow down!

915
01:15:31,319 --> 01:15:32,652
Look out!

916
01:15:34,614 --> 01:15:36,865
Hey, you almost
killed a guy here!

917
01:15:41,287 --> 01:15:44,206
I'm gonna get you,
motherfucker!

918
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:34,464
- Nina, come with me.
- Tom.

919
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,424
We can't talk here. Is there a
back way out of this place?

920
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:37,842
What happened to Susan?

921
01:16:37,843 --> 01:16:40,679
Listen, we cannot talk here,
you're in danger, all right?

922
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,223
- What's going on?
- It doesn't...

923
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:46,768
- Can I go to my place?
- No, don't go there, they'll kill you.

924
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:51,189
Oh, my God!

925
01:16:51,649 --> 01:16:54,818
You have to get lost,
and I mean really, really lost.

926
01:16:54,819 --> 01:16:56,611
Thank you for before.

927
01:16:57,530 --> 01:16:59,281
- Go.
- There he is!

928
01:17:09,375 --> 01:17:11,376
Look out, he's got a gun!

929
01:17:11,377 --> 01:17:14,004
I think we should go back
to the Pentagon, sir.

930
01:17:22,138 --> 01:17:26,224
That was a stupid,
stupid thing you did.

931
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:28,768
I think you're crazy.

932
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:31,313
I'm going to save Brice,
no matter what it takes.

933
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:33,940
- I thought I already told you that.
- I don't believe there is a Yuri.

934
01:17:33,941 --> 01:17:35,066
He's real enough, all right.

935
01:17:35,234 --> 01:17:37,277
Yeah, but has nothing to do with
the murder of that girl, does he?

936
01:17:37,278 --> 01:17:39,195
We'll find that out
when we catch him.

937
01:17:39,196 --> 01:17:41,072
Not if those two get
to him first you won't.

938
01:17:41,073 --> 01:17:44,826
Damn it!
I am tired of weakness.

939
01:17:45,036 --> 01:17:46,953
I am faced with a grave problem,

940
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:49,914
and I intend to resolve
it quickly and cleanly.

941
01:17:49,915 --> 01:17:51,916
You really are crazy.
You're fucking cuckoo.

942
01:17:51,917 --> 01:17:53,376
I won't be insulted by you,

943
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:56,921
and you're not to attempt to interfere
with this investigation again.

944
01:17:56,922 --> 01:17:58,798
Do I make myself clear?

945
01:17:59,258 --> 01:18:00,634
I quit.

946
01:18:00,635 --> 01:18:03,637
Your resignation is not accepted.
Tom, be reasonable.

947
01:18:03,638 --> 01:18:05,680
I'm deliberately shielding
you from full knowledge.

948
01:18:05,681 --> 01:18:08,224
Just follow your orders and
everything will be all right.

949
01:18:08,225 --> 01:18:09,809
Let him go!

950
01:18:15,816 --> 01:18:18,360
Will you excuse me, please?

951
01:18:19,278 --> 01:18:21,029
I hope you're not
calling your girlfriend.

952
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:23,782
Remember,
Big Brother's listening.

953
01:18:25,159 --> 01:18:27,243
- I don't give a shit.
- Hello?

954
01:18:27,244 --> 01:18:29,454
- Fox!
- Hello, sir.

955
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:33,917
The writing on the box is Arabic,
but it's in the Maghrebi dialect.

956
01:18:33,918 --> 01:18:35,877
What they speak in Morocco.

957
01:18:35,878 --> 01:18:39,339
What it says is kind of flowery,
but it boils down to:

958
01:18:39,340 --> 01:18:41,800
"A gift to a true friend. "

959
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:44,511
Good boy,
you can come back now.

960
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:51,893
Oh, jeez.

961
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:03,279
The Polaroid just came online.
Not much to look at, is it?

962
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,615
No, it's not.

963
01:19:08,452 --> 01:19:09,911
Don't gifts from
foreign governments

964
01:19:09,912 --> 01:19:12,580
have to be registered with
the Office of Protocol?

965
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,166
- That's what they tell us.
- Are their files computerized?

966
01:19:15,167 --> 01:19:16,543
Yes, of course
they would be in

967
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:18,378
the Department of State's
computer bank.

968
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:20,422
Can we access those files?

969
01:19:21,716 --> 01:19:24,259
They're closed. You'll have to get
in touch with them tomorrow.

970
01:19:27,138 --> 01:19:29,264
I can't get in touch with them.

971
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,903
- We can interface.
- Can you do it now?

972
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:48,742
There'll be hell to pay.

973
01:19:49,618 --> 01:19:53,037
Tom, does it matter
to you that much?

974
01:19:59,462 --> 01:20:01,379
Okay.

975
01:20:02,298 --> 01:20:05,258
Thanks,
I'll be back in five minutes.

976
01:20:09,472 --> 01:20:10,847
Come in.

977
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:16,853
What is it now?

978
01:20:20,775 --> 01:20:23,485
I've been thinking it over
and maybe you're right.

979
01:20:23,486 --> 01:20:24,861
Yes.

980
01:20:25,029 --> 01:20:27,822
Let's just get this
whole business over with,

981
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:29,991
and I'm sorry I
blew up at you.

982
01:20:32,328 --> 01:20:34,204
We're all very tired.

983
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:39,083
Tom,

984
01:20:40,127 --> 01:20:43,588
when this is out of the way,
we can do great things here.

985
01:20:46,634 --> 01:20:49,677
Well, first things first.

986
01:20:59,897 --> 01:21:01,105
How we doing, Sam?

987
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:03,942
I'm into the State Department computer.
It was easy.

988
01:21:04,151 --> 01:21:06,528
- Can you print that out for me?
- You got it.

989
01:21:07,655 --> 01:21:11,699
A lot of paper. You were right
about the credit card receipts.

990
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,993
We found one from a gas
station in Annapolis.

991
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:17,372
Great.

992
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:21,000
These the new people
at the Pentagon?

993
01:21:21,001 --> 01:21:24,254
Yeah, there are 4700
possibles so far.

994
01:21:24,255 --> 01:21:25,797
But we've had a real break.

995
01:21:25,798 --> 01:21:28,550
The CID has pinned down
your man's blood type.

996
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:32,846
- How'd they get that?
- Autopsy specimen.

997
01:21:33,097 --> 01:21:35,348
There was a residue of
semen in the woman's body.

998
01:21:35,349 --> 01:21:37,141
Blood type is A-positive.

999
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:39,519
That's pretty common,
but it'll help narrow the list.

1000
01:21:42,565 --> 01:21:44,691
You're a genius, Sam.

1001
01:21:45,985 --> 01:21:48,778
I am. I am. I am.

1002
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:08,673
You should get some sleep.
You must be exhausted.

1003
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:11,801
I know if I'm exhausted or not.

1004
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,846
As you say.

1005
01:22:15,306 --> 01:22:18,016
You look like you just
stepped out of a bandbox.

1006
01:22:19,518 --> 01:22:21,352
You're actually enjoying this,
aren't you?

1007
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:23,146
I'm just trying to do my job.

1008
01:22:23,314 --> 01:22:27,233
It would be a lot easier
if you'd stop attacking me.

1009
01:22:30,029 --> 01:22:31,946
I'm sorry, I'm just tired.

1010
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:34,449
I've got a lot on my mind.

1011
01:22:38,537 --> 01:22:41,331
If it doesn't keep moving
towards a coherent image,

1012
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:43,166
we just adjust the program.

1013
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:48,838
You mean, you could stop it and
make it go in another direction?

1014
01:22:49,048 --> 01:22:53,217
We've been doing that all along,
but it looks like it's doing fine now.

1015
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:00,433
I'm not so sure.

1016
01:23:25,334 --> 01:23:27,752
I think it's time
we had a talk.

1017
01:23:39,640 --> 01:23:42,016
I'm the one in
the picture, Sam.

1018
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,270
You?

1019
01:23:49,316 --> 01:23:53,027
Susan Atwell was the
woman I've been seeing.

1020
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:56,322
I had nothing to do
with her death.

1021
01:23:57,241 --> 01:23:58,825
I was in love with her.

1022
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:03,454
Jesus,
you must feel terrible.

1023
01:24:06,625 --> 01:24:09,961
You're the only one I can tell that
this spy-hunt thing's a phony.

1024
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:12,714
Yuri doesn't have anything
to do with the murder?

1025
01:24:12,923 --> 01:24:13,881
Nothing.

1026
01:24:14,091 --> 01:24:19,303
This, it's a cover-up.
That's all I can tell you.

1027
01:24:19,513 --> 01:24:22,515
- Come on.
- Goddamn it, Sam, this is...

1028
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:27,311
This is for your own
protection, all right?

1029
01:24:27,563 --> 01:24:31,024
These people have already tried
to kill one person who knew.

1030
01:24:32,651 --> 01:24:33,651
What do you want me to do?

1031
01:24:33,652 --> 01:24:36,362
Will you slow up the
resolution on that picture?

1032
01:24:36,363 --> 01:24:37,530
I need more time, Sam.

1033
01:24:37,531 --> 01:24:39,574
I need more time to get
this straightened out.

1034
01:24:51,545 --> 01:24:53,755
That's what I need.

1035
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:12,690
I'm not satisfied with
the way this is coming up.

1036
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:14,233
The Eigenvalue is off.

1037
01:25:14,985 --> 01:25:16,611
Looks all right to me.

1038
01:25:16,612 --> 01:25:19,155
We're pulling away from
our reference information.

1039
01:25:19,156 --> 01:25:22,617
Advise them to program
a Fourier Transform.

1040
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,118
I don't know, that seems
like a waste of time.

1041
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,204
Just do what I want, okay?

1042
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,999
Take it easy, Sam, we're all working
the same amount of time.

1043
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:33,044
I'm sorry, David.
Just do it, please, okay?

1044
01:25:50,229 --> 01:25:52,438
What are you looking for?

1045
01:25:52,439 --> 01:25:54,524
Fuck off.

1046
01:26:09,123 --> 01:26:11,290
Where are you going?

1047
01:26:19,967 --> 01:26:24,262
I would rather do this myself.
You can listen if you want to.

1048
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:37,984
- Display that badge. Hi.
- Hi.

1049
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,612
- This goes here?
- Yeah.

1050
01:26:41,864 --> 01:26:42,905
Where are we going?

1051
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:44,657
We're gonna go down to
Major Donovan's office.

1052
01:26:44,658 --> 01:26:46,534
You can give a full description
of this guy to him.

1053
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,994
Who the hell's Donovan?

1054
01:26:47,995 --> 01:26:49,829
He's our commanding officer.

1055
01:27:42,549 --> 01:27:44,050
Hello.

1056
01:27:44,301 --> 01:27:46,719
You know who this is?

1057
01:27:48,347 --> 01:27:51,349
I have to talk to you,
but I can't leave here now.

1058
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:56,437
I'm on the damn pay phone now.
It's probably not even safe.

1059
01:28:01,276 --> 01:28:04,403
All right, I'll come there
as soon as I can get away.

1060
01:28:19,169 --> 01:28:22,421
I'll be damned! That's him, the son
of a bitch who rented the boat!

1061
01:28:22,422 --> 01:28:23,256
Where?

1062
01:28:23,257 --> 01:28:24,882
Right there, he just went
around the corner!

1063
01:28:31,890 --> 01:28:33,349
Do you see him?

1064
01:28:34,893 --> 01:28:36,227
He's gone.

1065
01:28:37,771 --> 01:28:38,938
I'll get back to you.

1066
01:28:38,939 --> 01:28:40,773
Where have you been?
Yuri's in the building.

1067
01:28:40,774 --> 01:28:42,024
Would you buzz
the Secretary, please.

1068
01:28:42,025 --> 01:28:43,526
They were bringing in a
witness and he spotted him.

1069
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:45,861
I know!
Can I go in?

1070
01:28:45,862 --> 01:28:49,282
- Go right in.
- Well, what are my orders, sir?

1071
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:50,992
Close all the exits, Major.

1072
01:28:50,993 --> 01:28:53,119
Hold your witness while
we decide what to do.

1073
01:28:53,787 --> 01:28:55,371
Yes, sir.

1074
01:28:58,375 --> 01:29:00,376
- Is Yuri in the building?
- So it would seem.

1075
01:29:00,377 --> 01:29:03,504
- This is splendid work, Tom.
- I've had all the exits closed.

1076
01:29:05,674 --> 01:29:10,386
Why don't we empty the building and
have everybody file past this man?

1077
01:29:10,637 --> 01:29:12,221
Then in five minutes the
place will be swarming

1078
01:29:12,222 --> 01:29:13,514
with television cameramen.

1079
01:29:13,515 --> 01:29:15,141
We'll just have to take the
witness through the building,

1080
01:29:15,142 --> 01:29:16,183
room by room.

1081
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:18,019
It's the largest building
in the world.

1082
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:19,937
It's the only way
we'll get any privacy.

1083
01:29:21,023 --> 01:29:22,481
I'll see to it.

1084
01:29:23,859 --> 01:29:27,945
Major Donovan, I suggest
that all officers carry side arms.

1085
01:29:29,031 --> 01:29:32,033
The man we're after has killed
at least one person already.

1086
01:29:32,034 --> 01:29:34,785
Don't worry, Tom.
I don't expect you to carry one.

1087
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:57,308
Tall or short? Thin or fat?
Light or dark?

1088
01:29:57,559 --> 01:30:01,187
- That's right.
- You think this is some kind of joke?

1089
01:30:01,188 --> 01:30:04,315
What I'm trying to tell you is
the son of a bitch is average.

1090
01:30:05,192 --> 01:30:09,111
All right, let's go find this
"average" son of a bitch.

1091
01:30:10,364 --> 01:30:14,742
I'm positive I remember this guy.
I always remember the good tippers.

1092
01:30:22,667 --> 01:30:24,919
CID has brought in
another witness.

1093
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,005
A bellboy from a
hotel in Annapolis.

1094
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,258
Now you can have
two search parties.

1095
01:30:32,386 --> 01:30:36,180
That's great news.
We can move twice as fast.

1096
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:38,682
I'll see to it.

1097
01:30:47,192 --> 01:30:50,236
You see, David?
It's all coming together.

1098
01:30:50,237 --> 01:30:52,279
Dear God,
I hope you're right.

1099
01:31:16,555 --> 01:31:19,098
All right, down this corridor.
Make it quick.

1100
01:31:20,100 --> 01:31:21,684
Let's go.

1101
01:31:52,424 --> 01:31:55,634
That ain't him. I just rented the
guy a sailboat, give me a break.

1102
01:31:55,635 --> 01:31:57,428
I'm getting sick of this shit.

1103
01:32:11,485 --> 01:32:12,526
How much longer?

1104
01:32:12,777 --> 01:32:14,945
Scott, it's impossible to
search this entire building.

1105
01:32:14,946 --> 01:32:16,447
It would take all night.

1106
01:32:16,448 --> 01:32:18,574
We have a shift finishing
at 5 and one at 6.

1107
01:32:18,575 --> 01:32:20,117
What do you suggest
we do then?

1108
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:21,952
Let them out through
the mall entrance.

1109
01:32:21,953 --> 01:32:25,122
- We'll have both witnesses there.
- What do you think?

1110
01:32:26,708 --> 01:32:28,334
Television.

1111
01:32:28,585 --> 01:32:30,336
We haven't been
allowed inside, Mark,

1112
01:32:30,337 --> 01:32:32,588
but we're told there's
a bottleneck of hundreds

1113
01:32:32,589 --> 01:32:35,508
perhaps thousands of people,
waiting to go home.

1114
01:32:35,509 --> 01:32:37,134
Those who have been
allowed to leave say

1115
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:40,179
they were first cleared by
members of the CID.

1116
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:43,724
That's The Criminal Investigation
Division of Army intelligence.

1117
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:48,020
Apparently, there's a search on
for a person who may be a spy

1118
01:32:48,021 --> 01:32:51,440
trapped, right now,
inside the Pentagon itself.

1119
01:32:51,441 --> 01:32:54,276
We will stay here and follow
these events as they develop

1120
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:56,946
and we'll get back to you with
updates as the story continues.

1121
01:32:56,947 --> 01:33:00,533
Melissa Donaldson, WCDM,
at the Pentagon.

1122
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:02,826
He must have
gotten out past us.

1123
01:33:02,827 --> 01:33:05,663
No way. He's hiding
somewhere in the building.

1124
01:33:06,706 --> 01:33:09,208
We'll have to go back
to the room-to-room.

1125
01:33:09,209 --> 01:33:10,626
We'll go down to
the basement level,

1126
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:13,379
search the situation room
computer complex.

1127
01:33:13,380 --> 01:33:15,798
We'll start at the bottom
and work our way up.

1128
01:33:15,799 --> 01:33:17,091
Let's do it.

1129
01:33:17,300 --> 01:33:19,009
Jesus.

1130
01:33:21,638 --> 01:33:23,847
- You're to initial this, sir.
- What?

1131
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:25,599
- You're to initial this.
- What is it?

1132
01:33:25,600 --> 01:33:29,895
It's authorization to release the
Atwell woman's body for burial.

1133
01:33:36,403 --> 01:33:38,696
We're down to about 50
persons with A-positive blood.

1134
01:33:38,697 --> 01:33:40,447
- How many are men?
- Aw, come on.

1135
01:33:40,448 --> 01:33:42,366
Nobody told me we had
to sort them out by sex.

1136
01:33:42,367 --> 01:33:45,119
Look, I gotta take a break, man.

1137
01:33:45,120 --> 01:33:46,954
Sam, I need to talk to you.

1138
01:33:57,882 --> 01:34:00,092
- I have to have your help.
- I slowed it up as much as I could.

1139
01:34:00,093 --> 01:34:02,469
I know, but they're going to be
able to recognize this picture soon.

1140
01:34:02,470 --> 01:34:03,679
There's nothing
more I can do.

1141
01:34:03,680 --> 01:34:04,930
They mean to kill me, Sam.

1142
01:34:04,931 --> 01:34:06,682
Tom, you haven't slept
for two days.

1143
01:34:06,683 --> 01:34:09,351
I'm telling you the truth,
I don't stand a chance in hell.

1144
01:34:09,352 --> 01:34:10,853
For God sakes, why?

1145
01:34:10,854 --> 01:34:13,147
If you didn't have anything to do
with the girl's murder, why would...

1146
01:34:13,148 --> 01:34:15,107
Brice killed her.

1147
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,859
- Brice?
- She was his mistress.

1148
01:34:16,860 --> 01:34:19,987
- I thought she was your girl.
- Look, here. See this?

1149
01:34:22,073 --> 01:34:24,158
- See this?
- "Antique gold box"...

1150
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:26,452
This is a present to Brice from
the Moroccan government.

1151
01:34:26,453 --> 01:34:27,870
He gave it to Susan.

1152
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:29,997
It's the only way
I can prove he knew her.

1153
01:34:29,998 --> 01:34:32,333
He'll call off the search,
Sam, I know he will.

1154
01:34:34,294 --> 01:34:36,879
- I see.
- Do you believe me?

1155
01:34:37,631 --> 01:34:41,383
Well, then can you insert that into
the State Department's computer?

1156
01:34:43,094 --> 01:34:46,555
- I can do that.
- I know you can, Sam, but will you?

1157
01:34:48,016 --> 01:34:51,143
- I'll do whatever I have to do to help.
- Then let's do it.

1158
01:35:29,432 --> 01:35:30,974
I'm standing there,
there's nothing there, Sam.

1159
01:35:30,975 --> 01:35:33,018
If you just want a piece of paper,
you can type it yourself.

1160
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:34,061
I thought we'd just print...

1161
01:35:34,062 --> 01:35:37,648
The computer is searching the protocol
to find the right place to insert it

1162
01:35:37,649 --> 01:35:38,857
and then it'll print it out.

1163
01:35:38,858 --> 01:35:41,694
- All right, how long?
- Soon.

1164
01:35:41,695 --> 01:35:44,780
First two on the right,
second two on the left.

1165
01:35:44,781 --> 01:35:48,075
Last man in the doorway.
Nobody in or out.

1166
01:35:48,368 --> 01:35:49,451
What's going on here?

1167
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:50,828
We're getting ready
to search in here.

1168
01:35:50,829 --> 01:35:52,746
I can see that, who told you
to bring them in here?

1169
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,916
Nobody, this is the only major area
that hasn't been covered yet.

1170
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:03,090
All right ladies and gentlemen,
we'll be conducting a search in here

1171
01:36:03,091 --> 01:36:04,883
and I ask you all, please...

1172
01:36:04,884 --> 01:36:07,010
- Sir, wait.
- Oh, Jesus.

1173
01:36:08,638 --> 01:36:10,097
I have to change.

1174
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:15,978
- Okay, let's get going.
- Don't let anyone pass.

1175
01:36:40,378 --> 01:36:41,837
Sam Hesselman.

1176
01:36:44,382 --> 01:36:48,218
Look, I'm sorry to bother you,
but this is over my head.

1177
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:51,472
It's about Commander Farrell.

1178
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:54,850
I'm not sure...

1179
01:36:57,562 --> 01:36:59,730
I'm not sure he knows
what he's doing.

1180
01:37:02,192 --> 01:37:03,317
All right, I'll meet you.

1181
01:37:03,318 --> 01:37:05,736
Please, don't mention
this to anybody else.

1182
01:37:05,737 --> 01:37:09,948
I mean, the reason I called you was
because I know you're his friend.

1183
01:37:09,949 --> 01:37:11,825
You did the right thing.

1184
01:37:17,415 --> 01:37:18,665
This door's locked.

1185
01:37:18,666 --> 01:37:20,751
Anybody have an
extra key out here?

1186
01:37:24,130 --> 01:37:26,423
This is Commander
Farrell's office, isn't it?

1187
01:37:26,424 --> 01:37:27,716
Yeah, we better have
a look in here.

1188
01:37:40,146 --> 01:37:44,191
Well, tell you what, fellas.
Here we go, maybe this will work.

1189
01:38:08,716 --> 01:38:10,551
Nobody here.

1190
01:38:10,552 --> 01:38:11,844
Let's get on up the
hall here, gentlemen,

1191
01:38:11,845 --> 01:38:13,720
and see what else we
can come up with.

1192
01:38:32,031 --> 01:38:33,490
Hi.

1193
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:37,661
What's this all about,
Dr. Hesselman?

1194
01:38:39,956 --> 01:38:41,248
You have to promise
me that what I

1195
01:38:41,249 --> 01:38:43,208
tell you won't
go any further.

1196
01:38:43,209 --> 01:38:46,670
- I feel disloyal enough as it is.
- Of course.

1197
01:38:48,673 --> 01:38:51,091
You understand that Tom
is under great strain.

1198
01:38:51,885 --> 01:38:53,427
Yes.

1199
01:38:54,345 --> 01:38:56,555
He knew the girl
who was murdered.

1200
01:38:57,515 --> 01:39:00,726
They were very close.

1201
01:39:02,186 --> 01:39:05,063
And he thinks that
Secretary Brice killed her.

1202
01:39:06,941 --> 01:39:08,275
Look, I know him.

1203
01:39:08,276 --> 01:39:11,361
He's much more high-strung
than he appears.

1204
01:39:11,362 --> 01:39:13,196
And this girl, uh...

1205
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:17,409
I guess he was in
love with her.

1206
01:39:18,870 --> 01:39:21,622
Anyway, now he thinks that
somebody wants to kill him

1207
01:39:21,623 --> 01:39:25,000
and he asked me to reprogram
the computers, and I did it.

1208
01:39:26,002 --> 01:39:31,131
But now I don't know.
I just don't know.

1209
01:39:31,925 --> 01:39:34,718
I see. Where is
Commander Farrell now?

1210
01:39:35,678 --> 01:39:38,597
I suppose he's in his office
or in the computer room.

1211
01:39:39,349 --> 01:39:41,391
Thank you.

1212
01:40:54,048 --> 01:40:55,757
Son of a bitch.

1213
01:42:00,865 --> 01:42:02,157
Hey!

1214
01:42:02,784 --> 01:42:05,243
- Come back here!
- Hold it right there!

1215
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:07,287
- Hold it!
- Sergeant, arrest that man.

1216
01:42:07,497 --> 01:42:09,122
I'm your superior officer
and I'm giving you

1217
01:42:09,123 --> 01:42:11,041
a direct order to
arrest this man!

1218
01:42:11,292 --> 01:42:13,877
- I have my orders from Mr. Pritchard!
- Do it!

1219
01:42:14,087 --> 01:42:16,004
- I have my orders...
- Shut up!

1220
01:42:16,255 --> 01:42:17,839
Jesus.

1221
01:42:18,341 --> 01:42:20,509
- And if he resists, shoot him!
- Yes, sir.

1222
01:42:20,510 --> 01:42:22,928
Where are you going, Commander?
You can't go in there.

1223
01:42:22,929 --> 01:42:24,679
You can't go in there!

1224
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,264
I said you can't go in there!

1225
01:42:26,265 --> 01:42:27,349
Commander,
by what right do you...

1226
01:42:27,350 --> 01:42:29,476
- Call off the search now.
- Lorraine, thank you.

1227
01:42:29,477 --> 01:42:30,977
You're not looking for
a Russian spy.

1228
01:42:30,978 --> 01:42:33,313
You're looking for somebody who
knows Susan Atwell was your mistress.

1229
01:42:33,314 --> 01:42:34,439
What are you talking about?

1230
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,359
You gave her a gold box that a Moroccan
foreign minister gave to you.

1231
01:42:37,360 --> 01:42:38,193
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1232
01:42:38,194 --> 01:42:40,112
Well you declared it to the
Office of Protocol.

1233
01:42:40,113 --> 01:42:41,321
I never declared anything
to the Office of Protocol.

1234
01:42:41,322 --> 01:42:42,114
Yeah?

1235
01:42:42,115 --> 01:42:45,200
- You tell it to the State's computer.
- What?

1236
01:42:45,451 --> 01:42:47,369
You tell it to the computer
at the State Department.

1237
01:42:47,370 --> 01:42:50,664
Now pick up the phone,
and call off the search now!

1238
01:42:50,665 --> 01:42:53,083
Do it, or I swear to God
I'll nail you to the wall.

1239
01:42:53,084 --> 01:42:55,043
Calm down,
I'll get Scott in here, we'll...

1240
01:42:55,044 --> 01:42:57,129
Come in, for God sakes.

1241
01:42:59,298 --> 01:43:01,758
I'm sorry Mr. Secretary,
I had to make sure you were all right.

1242
01:43:02,260 --> 01:43:05,095
Yuri must be close.
There's been a murder.

1243
01:43:06,013 --> 01:43:09,558
- He shot Dr. Hesselman.
- Oh, goddamn it.

1244
01:43:09,559 --> 01:43:11,017
What's happened, Major?

1245
01:43:11,686 --> 01:43:13,228
I think we got
Yuri cornered.

1246
01:43:13,229 --> 01:43:14,271
He's somewhere between here,

1247
01:43:14,272 --> 01:43:16,439
communications and
the officers' gymnasium.

1248
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,567
That's very good, Major.
Just continue the search.

1249
01:43:29,370 --> 01:43:31,913
You had those apes
kill him, didn't you?

1250
01:43:32,373 --> 01:43:33,832
No.

1251
01:43:34,584 --> 01:43:36,668
You lying sack of shit.

1252
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:41,423
Tom is the man who
saw you at Susan's.

1253
01:43:42,383 --> 01:43:45,343
He's known about you all along.
Isn't that right?

1254
01:43:46,345 --> 01:43:48,430
You know what that means, David.

1255
01:43:48,890 --> 01:43:52,267
If Commander Farrell is the
man who was with Miss Atwell

1256
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:55,520
then Commander Farrell is the
man who killed Miss Atwell.

1257
01:43:55,521 --> 01:43:59,149
And we know that the man
who killed Miss Atwell is Yuri.

1258
01:43:59,400 --> 01:44:04,863
Therefore, Commander Farrell is Yuri,
quod erat demonstrandum.

1259
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:08,909
You murdered Sam, didn't you?
You're a fucking asshole.

1260
01:44:13,873 --> 01:44:19,044
You have no idea what
men of power can do!

1261
01:44:19,045 --> 01:44:21,296
- You sick fuck.
- Wait a second.

1262
01:44:21,547 --> 01:44:23,965
Scott has been a loyal
and valuable friend.

1263
01:44:24,717 --> 01:44:27,177
I let that friendship
cloud my judgment.

1264
01:44:27,386 --> 01:44:29,554
My actions have
been inexcusable.

1265
01:44:30,306 --> 01:44:33,266
Scott!
Scott!

1266
01:44:34,810 --> 01:44:36,478
Give me the gun.

1267
01:44:37,521 --> 01:44:40,607
This is the hardest thing
I've ever had to do in my life.

1268
01:44:40,608 --> 01:44:43,360
But I swear, I'll do everything
I can to help you out.

1269
01:44:43,361 --> 01:44:44,402
Everything.

1270
01:44:44,403 --> 01:44:46,363
I'll get you the best lawyers.

1271
01:44:49,325 --> 01:44:53,161
David? He doesn't have
a shred of proof.

1272
01:44:54,497 --> 01:44:56,122
Wait. Wait. Wait.

1273
01:44:57,541 --> 01:44:59,584
He was fiercely
jealous of Susan.

1274
01:44:59,585 --> 01:45:01,878
A man like that...
Do you understand?

1275
01:45:01,879 --> 01:45:05,382
Suppose we had planned on
working late Sunday night.

1276
01:45:05,383 --> 01:45:07,550
I didn't arrive, he assumed
I was with Susan.

1277
01:45:07,551 --> 01:45:09,511
- David?
- Don't touch me.

1278
01:45:09,971 --> 01:45:12,555
He went there looking for me.
They argued.

1279
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:14,349
Well, you can
assume the rest, right?

1280
01:45:14,350 --> 01:45:16,685
- Just save your breath.
- Help me out.

1281
01:45:16,686 --> 01:45:18,395
Help me out.
Help me out.

1282
01:45:19,855 --> 01:45:21,398
Listen, I'll give you
anything you want.

1283
01:45:23,359 --> 01:45:25,443
I swear, I'll give you
anything you want.

1284
01:45:25,444 --> 01:45:27,153
Listen to me.
Listen to me!

1285
01:45:27,154 --> 01:45:29,990
Help me out.
I will give you anything you want.

1286
01:45:29,991 --> 01:45:31,491
Just help me out of this.

1287
01:45:31,492 --> 01:45:32,867
You can have
anything you want.

1288
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:34,411
If you go against me on this,

1289
01:45:34,412 --> 01:45:36,830
it'll be your word
against mine, and I'll win.

1290
01:45:36,831 --> 01:45:38,498
David!

1291
01:45:39,542 --> 01:45:40,917
- Scott!
- No!

1292
01:45:50,261 --> 01:45:53,888
- What's going on in there?
- Stand back, Mr. Secretary.

1293
01:46:00,187 --> 01:46:01,479
Nelson.

1294
01:46:06,861 --> 01:46:08,737
Your search is over, Major.

1295
01:46:13,200 --> 01:46:15,744
- Is this...?
- He shot himself.

1296
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,208
Anderson.

1297
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:33,219
Commander,
do I have your answer?

1298
01:46:34,472 --> 01:46:37,724
Commander? Sir?
Sir, are you all right, sir?

1299
01:46:38,267 --> 01:46:40,018
- Give me your pen, ensign.
- Sir?

1300
01:46:40,019 --> 01:46:41,728
- You got a pen?
- Oh, yes sir.

1301
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:43,646
Well, give it to me.

1302
01:46:46,275 --> 01:46:47,901
I want you to deliver this.

1303
01:46:49,236 --> 01:46:51,446
And I want you to wake
him if you have to.

1304
01:46:53,699 --> 01:46:55,283
Aye, aye, sir.

1305
01:46:56,118 --> 01:46:57,577
Go.

1306
01:47:11,550 --> 01:47:13,343
Charlie,
come look at this.

1307
01:47:14,637 --> 01:47:18,014
- Somebody get Donovan down here.
- It's Commander Farrell.

1308
01:48:00,558 --> 01:48:02,809
A lot of people
are looking for you.

1309
01:48:06,188 --> 01:48:08,314
Then aren't you
the clever ones.

1310
01:48:21,078 --> 01:48:22,745
When is he coming
out from behind there?

1311
01:48:22,746 --> 01:48:25,290
Perhaps when you've made
certain things clearer to us.

1312
01:48:25,291 --> 01:48:28,001
- Well, then, let's just get...
- We want to know what is...

1313
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:31,045
You would've known before!

1314
01:48:32,256 --> 01:48:35,383
I told you when I called that I
could not get out of the Pentagon!

1315
01:48:35,384 --> 01:48:37,510
All right, but at least you'll admit
that your relationship with

1316
01:48:37,511 --> 01:48:38,720
the woman was
poorly handled!

1317
01:48:38,721 --> 01:48:39,762
I did what I was told.

1318
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:41,347
You wanted me to be her lover,
I was her lover.

1319
01:48:41,348 --> 01:48:42,682
I don't see any point
in going on with this!

1320
01:48:42,683 --> 01:48:44,100
Yeah, well, neither do I!

1321
01:48:59,366 --> 01:49:01,910
It's been very long for me.

1322
01:49:05,581 --> 01:49:09,667
Evgeni Alekseevich, wouldn't you
love to hear Russian again?

1323
01:49:10,169 --> 01:49:13,713
Imagine Pushkin,
Lermontov, Tolstoy.

1324
01:49:13,714 --> 01:49:16,549
Solzhenitsyn, Aksenov.

1325
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:19,469
Even them.
Always the sense of humor.

1326
01:49:19,845 --> 01:49:21,346
In the Philippines
when you passed the

1327
01:49:21,347 --> 01:49:23,640
bag of underwear,
Moscow wasn't amused.

1328
01:49:24,767 --> 01:49:26,809
I should have acted then.

1329
01:49:27,895 --> 01:49:31,439
In any case, it's not possible for
you to remain in the United States.

1330
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,067
This bizarre incident has
given them their Yuri.

1331
01:49:34,902 --> 01:49:37,278
Evgeni, think.

1332
01:49:37,279 --> 01:49:40,740
- You're a hero of the Soviet Union.
- I'm not a hero.

1333
01:49:40,741 --> 01:49:42,617
Be that as it may,
you must return.

1334
01:49:42,618 --> 01:49:45,078
I came here.
I thought I owed you that.

1335
01:49:46,038 --> 01:49:48,248
But you can't
make me go back.

1336
01:49:54,004 --> 01:49:55,505
No!

1337
01:49:56,340 --> 01:49:58,174
Let him go.

1338
01:50:05,474 --> 01:50:08,810
He will return.
Where else does he have to go?
