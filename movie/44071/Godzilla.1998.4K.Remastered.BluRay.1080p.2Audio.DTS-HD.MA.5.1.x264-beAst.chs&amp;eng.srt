That was a footprint! I was standing inside of a footprint!

49
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,393
没错
That's right.

50
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,940
但是，世界上还没有什么动物有这么大的脚印
But there's no animal in the world that makes footprints like that, is there?

51
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,194
我告诉他们这不是你的领域，但他们不听天才的话
I told them this is not your field, but they never listen to genius.

52

00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:43,410
- 这些是脚印，对吗？ - 对，是的

55
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,203
有人看见是什么东西吗？
Did anybody see what made them?

56
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,499
事实上，没人有这运气
Actually, no such luck.

57
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,378
事情发生得太快了，在它经过后才会有人看见
It happened so fast, nobody knew what hit them until it was over.

58
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,922
- 爱丝  - 怎么了？

59
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,135
录影带到了，法国方面的消息

We believe it's connected. Dr. Craven, have you met the worm guy?

63
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,898
对不起，热伤风

71
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,719
可以将它排在五点吗？
Can we put this on the 5, please?

72
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,888
- 我应不应该问他？ - 不要！

- Just tell me. Did you talk with him? - It's between you and Rodriguez.

77

是真的? 他要考虑给我工作，他还说了什么？
You serious? He's gonna consider me for the job? What else did he say?

78
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,328
我们晚饭后再谈，在你那里
Why don't we talk about it over dinner tonight? Your place.

- Have I ever told you that before? - Mr. Caiman!

我一直为你搜集资料

82
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,340
三年多来一直加班加点地工作
...after hours and weekends for over three years.

83
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,593
这工作对我来说很重要
This is a very important job to me.

84
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,595
再做你的助手就太老了
I'm too old to be your assistant anymore.

85
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,848
我需要再进一步做其他工作了
I need to know this job is going someplace.

那不行
I can't.

那么你是说一直也没有
So do you mean to tell me there's no one...

100

我不知道，已经开足马力了，可能是捉到了大鱼
I don't know, she's at full throttle. Maybe she's heavy in the net.

00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:27,021
- 我们怎么会停下？捉到鱼了吗？ - 不像
- How come we stopped? Nets full? - I don't think so.

Hurry! Hurry!

131
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,740
船在向下沉！
She's going down!

132
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,698
听见了么？
Do you hear that?

133
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,897
打扰，先生，我们接到报告，三条渔船沉没
Excuse me, sir. We just got a report of three fishing trawlers going down.

134
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,069
- 什么使你觉得这有关联呢？ - 它们是被拉下去的
- What makes you think it's related? - The trawlers were pulled under, sir.

135
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,533
我的老天
Jesus Christ...

136
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,161
这东西距离东海岸只有200海哩
It's only 200 miles off the Eastern seaboard...

137
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,080
可是我们却不知道它是什么
...and we don't even know what it is.

138
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,748
- 兽脚亚目异龙 - 什么？
- Theropoda allosaurus. - What?

139
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
一种巨大的爬行动物
A type of enormous reptile...

140
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,919
我们认为它在白垩纪就灭绝了
...that we believed died out in the Cretaceous Period.

141
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,630
那么它在哪里藏了六千万年呢？
So where's it been hiding the last 60 million years?

142
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,216
会不会与辐射有关呢？
What about the traces of radiation?

143
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,513
辐射的作用不可忽视，这是一个线索
The radiation isn't an anomaly. It's the clue.

144
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,975
这个家伙就算是恐龙也太大了
This animal is much too big to be some kind of lost dinosaur.

145
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,686
别说它什么也不是，那你说是什么？
Don't tell me what it isn't, tell me what it is.

146
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,355
那好，我们来推测一下
Well, what do we know?

147
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:21,028
首先是在法属波利尼西亚太平洋发现的
It was first sighted off of the French Polynesian Pacific.

148
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,032
那地区进行了几十次核爆试验
That area has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests.

149
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,369
- 然后有了核辐射 - 不只这样
- Hence the radiation. - More than that.

150
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,872
我认为它是一个变异的物种
I believe it's a mutated aberration.

151
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,959
由这个岛上核爆产生的辐射尘埃所导致的杂交物种
A hybrid caused by the fallout on these islands.

152
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,961
和你的蚯蚓一样吗？
Like your earthworms?

153
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,463
对，是的
Yes. Yes.

154
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,634
我们在寻找一种初次出现的生物
We're looking at a completely incipient creature.

155
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,512
一个新物种的
The dawn of a new species.

156
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,223
第一个个体
The first of its kind.

157
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,330
纽约

158
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,810
不夜城

159
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,076
- 我的生活太不顺了 - 噢，想开点
- My life sucks. - Oh, please.

160
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:13,497
- 你的生活不算不顺，他的生活才不顺呢  - 因为我娶了你
- Your life doesn't suck. His life sucks. - Because I'm married to you.

161
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,583
我给他那么拼命地工作
I cannot believe he put the moves on me.

162
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,460
他却一点机会都不给我
After everything I've done for him.

163
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,420
他是个色鬼
He is scum.

164
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,757
对他来说，你只是会说话的乳房
To him, you're just a pair of breasts that talk.

165
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,761
- 真富于想像 - 我告诉你，他就是垃圾
- Hey, there's an image. - I'm telling you, he is dirt.

166
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,805
他是冲厕所的水、粘痰、狗屎、呕吐物
He's a douche-bag, gutter-slime' dog-crap puke-chunks.

167
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,766
嘿，没看见我在吃东西吗？
Hey, you don't see I'm eating?

168
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,478
安琪，你太善良了
Audrey, you're too damn nice.

169
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:39,940
这就是你的弱点，好人在这里办不成什么事
That's your problem. Nice gets you nothing in this town.

170
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,778
在这个人吃人的社会，你必须不择手段向上爬
It's dog-eat-dog. You gotta be a killer to get ahead.

171
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,948
很抱歉，宝贝，你缺乏这种卑鄙的手段
I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.

172
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,287
- 你认为这对吗？ - 非常对，你人太好了
- Do you think that's true? - Pretty much. You're a nice person.

173
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,374
好人没好报
Nice guys finish last.

174
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,795
- 只要我想那么做的话我也会很卑鄙 - 当然
- I can be tough if I want. - Yeah, sure.

175
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,298
我可以，我可以的
I can. I can.

176
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,010
- 难点，呵呵，难点  - 毕竟…
- No, yeah, no. - Whatever.

177
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,805
哦，我的天！
Oh, my God!

178
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,142
哦，我的天！能把音量提高点吗？
Oh, my God! Could you turn that up please?

179
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,481
在过去的12小时里，仍然没有什么进展…
- Sometime in the last 12 hours. It is not known yet...

180
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,651
- 是尼克 - 他是谁？
- It's Nick. - Who is he?

181
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,988
他是我大学时的朋友，他在电视里很英俊
He was my college sweetie. He looks so handsome on TV.

182
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,575
坠机现场守卫森严
There is tight security around the crash site...

183
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,831
可能因为机上有敏感的货物
...possibly due to the sensitive military cargo on the plane.

184
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,178
快点卸货，我浑身湿透了
You wanna unload this thing? I'm getting soaked here.

185
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,222
快点，伙计们
Come on, will you?

186
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,273
嘿，乔！想钓条小鱼吗？
Hey, Joe! Gonna catch one of them little fish in the East River?

187
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,275
希望如此
I hope so.

188
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,610
但是你永远不会想到
But you never know.

189
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,905
我是说，今天是我的幸运日
I mean, today could be my lucky day.

190
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,366
我看你冻感冒还差不多
The only thing you'll catch is a cold.

191
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,589
嘿
Hey.

192
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,260
有鱼上钩了
I got a bite.

193
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,640
小子，真有鱼上钩了
Boy, do I have a bite!

194
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,522
不要让它跑了，乔，你逮到大家伙了，坚持住
Don't let up on him, Joe. You got a big one, baby. Hold on to it.

195
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,900
你还想跑？
You want to fight?

196
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,919
女士们，先生们，你们一直在等待的人在这里
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, the man you've all been waiting for.

197
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:33,090
使纽约治安更加好的艾波特市长！
Yours for a safer New York, your mayor, Mayor Ebert!

198
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,469
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

199
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:42,558
感谢你们在这种好天气下来到这里
I want to thank you all for coming out on this beautiful New York City day.

200
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,522
四年前人们不相信我能降低犯罪
Four years ago, people didn't think I would reduce crime.

201
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,233
但是我办到了！
But I did!

202
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,046
哦，我的天
Oh, my God.

203
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,899
快跑！让我们离开这里！
Move! Let's get out of here!

204
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,703
很高兴我们争取到了新节目
I'm grateful we're getting a new set.

205
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,414
我知道那代表管理委员会的意见
I know that represents a commitment from management.

206
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,375
可是我就不理解了
Here's what I don't understand:

207
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,460
为什么把城里唯一的
Why we're the only station in town...

208
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,588
韩国杂货店作为我们的头条新闻
...that doesn't have the Korean grocery holdup as our lead.

209
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,633
- 我们的头条是什么？又下雨了！  - 妈妈?
- What's our lead? Rain, again! - Mom?

210
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,428
我知道你去的酒会上的人都很漂亮
I know, it impresses the people at the parties you go to that we're classy.

211
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,348
可是我不想用那么重要的档期来播
Sorry, I just don't give a rat's ass about a war...

212
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,518
一个人名都不好发音的屁大点国家的屁事上
...in some country whose name I can't even pronounce.

213
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,022
- 怎么就没有大新闻？ - 先生？
- How about a real story? - Sir?

214
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,776
我认为你要的大新闻就在窗外
I think your story just walked by the window.

215
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,823
什么？
What?

216
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,035
可能我们能进到韩国杂货店的医务室里
Maybe we can get in the Korean grocer's hospital room.

217
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:29,289
- 你的罗密欧叫什么名？ - 尼克泰托・帕利斯
- So did this Romeo have a name? - Nick Tatopoulos.

218
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,710
- 天哪，这就是你为什么甩了他？ - 不是
- Jesus. Is that why you dumped him? - No.

219
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:37,464
- 你们有多少年？ - 大约四年
- How long did you go out for anyway? - Nearly four years.

220
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,467
我很奇怪，他为什么不向你求婚？
Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.

221
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,137
这就是问题所在
Well, that's the problem.

222
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,805
他求过
He did.

223
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,184
我希望那不是游行
Tell me that's not another parade.

224
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,479
我不认为是游行
I don't think that's a parade.

225
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,276
请等待进一步报导
Please stand by.

226
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,695
那到底是什么？
What the hell is that?

227
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,168
你没事吧？没受伤吧？没事吧样？
Are you all right? Are you cut? You all right?

228
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,673
维克多，别发疯！
Victor! Don't be stupid.

229
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,844
我的老天爷啊，这真是…
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! That is really...

230
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,681
太大了
That is large.

231
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,267
- 哦，我的天 - 哦，我的天
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God!

232
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,940
快点，妈的，快点！
Come on, you bastard. Come on!

233
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,570
维克多，快回来，你个白痴！
Victor, get back here, you retard!

234
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,372
谁来做点什么啊
Somebody do something!

235
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,757
快点！快点！
Come on! Come on!

236
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,527
你能告诉我们发生了什么事么？
Can you tell us what's going on?

237
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,112
看哪
Watch it!

238
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,520
机动部队指挥中心 － 新泽西

239
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,295
- 上士欧尼尔，长官 - 市长办公室有消息吗？
- Sergeant O'Neal, sir. - Any word from the mayor's office?

240
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,299
有，长官，他们主张疏散市区，他们还调动了国民警卫队
Yes, sir. They've agreed to evacuate the city. They've called the National Guard.

241
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,885
疏散曼哈顿？那可是三百万人
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over 3 million people.

242
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,554
- 以前这么做过么？ - 好像没有
- Has that ever been done before? - I don't think so.

243
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,558
- 他现在在什么地方？ - 我们失去它的踪影，长官
- Where is he now? - We lost sight of it, sir.

244
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,977
你再说一遍
You wanna run that by me again?

245
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,481
第一次攻击之后
After its initial attack, he...

246
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,151
它就消失了
...disappeared.

247
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,987
国防部长来电找你
Secretary of Defense Burk is on the line.

248
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,658
怎么可能，这么大的东西一下子就消失了？
I don't understand. How can something so big just disappear?

249
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,493
- 我们不知道，但是…  - 好的，好的
- We're not sure, but... - Yeah, yeah.

250
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,164
- 它可能回到河里了 - 我不这样认为　
- He probably returned to the river. - I don't think so.

251
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:03,462
你们看看，这个岛四面环海
I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An island, water on all sides.

252
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,761
很适合它这个大家伙藏身
But like no other island in the world' it's a place where he can easily hide.

253
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,096
它就在这里的某个地方
He's in there someplace.

254
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,932
第十二频道有报导了
Channel 12 caught it on tape.

255
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:19,853
嗨，我是查尔斯・卡门，在WIDF新闻中心报导
Hello, I'm Charles Caiman, in the WIDF news center.

256
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,523
女士，先生们，我们纽约人认为自己见多识广
Ladies and gentlemen, we New Υorkers like to think we've seen it all...

257
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:27,861
但现在你看到的会吓坏你
...but what you're going to see now will shock you beyond belief.

258
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,198
这个片段证实了

...as if Long Island or New Jersey were any refuge in this time of crisis.

301
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,025

This is great. If I'm wrong on this evacuation...

我不知道这是不是个好主意

318
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,229
你说什么？你偷来的

How often do you think you'll have an ex-boyfriend inside a major story?

322
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,491
这是一生难求的机会
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

323
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,161
只要你粘住这个…

你有胶水或是什么其他的么？

Sorry, Mr. Mayor, that's where we are at this point.

329

现在，继续，继续
Now, hold on. Hold on.

330
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:48,265
你是说我要在选举月疏散全市吗？
You're telling me, in an election month I evacuated this city for nothing?

331
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:52,185
你知道会有多大影响吗？
Do you realize what this evacuation will cost the people of this city?

332
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:54,854
我们一直在监测岛周围的水体

我能说的是它仍在那儿
As far as we can tell' this thing has not left the area.

- But you don't know for sure. - We have reason to believe...

00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,199
- 但你不能肯定 - 市长先生！
- But you don't know for sure! - Mr. Mayor.

- Right here, sir. - Have them fall in.

345
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,902
我们走，伙计们，到楼下集合
Let's go, people, fall in downstairs.

346
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:10,305
今天下午安德森中尉发现的
Lieutenant Anderson and his men found this, this afternoon.

347
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:18,772
上面建筑的地板没了
We were checking the building above and we discovered the floor was gone.

348
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,359
我么发现它会打洞
When we discovered that he could burrow his way through the tunnels...

349
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,404
我们意识到它可能不在这地区
...we realized he could be outside the quarantine zone.

350
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,114
我的老天
Holy Christ.

351
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:33,119
- 有多少通道出入这个岛？ - 十四条，我们已检查过，没有它到过的痕迹
- How many tunnels lead off the island? - Only 14. He hasn't used any of them.

352
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,164
- 将它们都封死 - 是，长官
- Have them all sealed up. - Yes, sir.

353
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,627
怎么？怎么封闭？
How? How would we do that, sir?

354
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:46,049
用水泥、砖头，我不管用什么
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put landmines in them. I don't care!

355
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,885
- 确保它不会离开这个岛 - 是的，长官
Make sure the damn thing doesn't leave the island.

356
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,895
你要知道，它并不是敌人
You know, he's not some enemy trying to evade you.

357
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,563
它只是一个动物
He's just an animal.

358
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,524
那你的建议是什么？
What are you suggesting?

359
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,943
当我想捉蚯蚓时
Well, when I had to catch earthworms...

360
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,987
最好的办法就是引它们出来
...I knew the best way to get them was not to dig them out...

361
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,614
而不是挖它们出来
...but to draw them out.

362
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:15,620
我们弄明白它需要什么后，它就会听你的
All we need to do is to find out what he needs, and he'll come to you.

363
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,435
- 他们在哪？ - D9部队，护航队在哪？
- Where are they now? - Delta Niner, where is the convoy?

364
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:40,687
长官，他们刚进入城市
Command, they've just entered the city.

365
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,994
我们和护送部队失去了无线电联系，我希望得到进一步证实
I have no contact with the convoy. I'm expecting ground confirmation.

366

Is it good?

369
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,895
快走！快走！跟上，快点过去！
Let's go, let's go! Come on, move it through!

370
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,195
有画面了，琼・卢克

371
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,405
收到一个信号，长官
We have a signal, sir.

372
00:41:37,954 --> 00:41:40,246
你说这是法国咖啡的！
You said this was French Roast!

373
00:41:40,454 --> 00:41:43,946
你看，确实是啊

374
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:48,129
多些奶油
More cream.

375
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:06,105
带他们进来，快点，带他们进来！
Bring them in. Come on, bring it back!

376
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:13,071
- 希望你的计划行得通 - 我也希望这样
- I sure hope this plan of yours works. - I'm kind of hoping that myself.

377
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,866
- 你赞成这样做么？ - 他们说做法很适当
- Did you approve this? - They just appropriated it.

378
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,910
12辆城市环卫车
Twelve of the city's dump trucks.

379
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,204
可以告诉我怎么回事吗？
Would you like to tell me what's going on here?

380
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,791
不可以，除此之外，你什么也别碰
Actually, no, I wouldn't. And don't touch anything.

381
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,002
- 进行的怎么样，欧尼尔？ - 一切都按计划，长官
- How's O'Neal doing? - Everything is on schedule, sir.

382
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,881
- 你真的不明白怎么回事吗？ - 没人告诉我啊
- Sure you didn't know about this? - No one told me anything about this.

383
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,008
为什么我到现在还留着你？
Why do I even keep you around?

384
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,183
倒出来！
Dump!

385
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:54,028
- 很奇怪，不是吗？ - 不，很聪明　
No. Very clever.

386
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,993
好的，堆起来，我们离开这里
All right, let's pile it on, and let's get out of here.

387
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,832
好多鱼啊
That's a lot of fish.

388
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,820
来吧，畜生，是晚饭时间了
Come on, you bastard, it's suppertime.

389
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,492
看上去都是冻鱼，这样会有效吗？
Look at all that frigging fish. Is this gonna work?

390
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:04,932
我们来打开下水道口，让它闻到鱼腥味
We gotta get the manholes uncovered. We want him to smell the bait.

391
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,726
快点！
Come on.

392
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,104
快走！快走！
Let's go! Let's go!

393
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,569
快点，伙计们
Come on, guys.

394
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,951
- 打开盖子，快！快！ - 他在做什么？
- Let's get those lids off. Go, go! - What the hell is he doing?

395
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,705
- 好的，这边，这边，快点！  - 我们走！
- Okay, this way, this way. Come on. - Let's go!

396
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,749
快点，那边！
Come on. Over there!

397
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,086
- 这个 - 是的，先生
- This one. - Yes, sir.

398
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,468
- 给我钩子 - 先生
- Give me the crowbar. - Sir.

399
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,413
就在这，我已瞄准
Set up here. I've got a shot.

400
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,193
我是阿尔法查尔
This is Six Alpha Charlie.

401
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,530
我们在前进，不能停止，我们在前进！
We gotta move. We can't stay put, we gotta move!

402
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,921
快走啊，后撤
Let's go, fall back!

403
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,971
走，走，走！
Go, go, go!

404
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,645
我们需要重武器
We need bigger guns.

405
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,983
- 我们失去联系了 - 重新连线，自由开火！
- We've lost communications. - Get us back online. Fire at will!

406
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,610
上士，自由开火！
Sergeant, fire at will!

407
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,778
开火！开火！开火！
Fire! Fire! Fire!

408
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,664
欧尼尔，进展怎么样？
O'Neal, you better tell me what's going on.

409
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,542
它跑了，埃寇机开始追踪
He's gone, sir, he's gone. Echo unit in pursuit.

410
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,723
跟我来
Follow my lead.

411
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,823
全系统装备完毕，4号机装备完毕
All systems armed. Echo 4 armed.

412
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,623
我们已经时速80节了，可还是追不上它，长官
We're doing 80 knots and he's pulling away, sir.

413
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,126
我已锁定目标
I've got him locked on.

414
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,546
- 锁定了，目标锁定  - 发射导弹
- Locked on, sir. Target is locked on. - Fire the damn missile.

415
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,716
- 埃寇1至4号，自由开火！ - 发射响尾蛇导弹
- Echo 1 through 4, fire at will. - Fire sidewinders.

416
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:44,290
妈的，命中错误，再说一遍，命中错误
Damn! That is a negative impact. I repeat, that is a negative impact.

417
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,834
- 命中错误，长官 - 命中错误？
- Negative impact, sir. - "Negative impact"?

418
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,462
击中了我们的克律大厦！
That's the damn Chrysler Building we're talking about.

419
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:53,007
- 你告诉我已瞄准目标 - 埃寇1，你不是说锁定了么？
- You told me he had it locked on. - Echo 1, we had you locked on.

420
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,510
那是热能制导导弹，不能追踪冷血动物
The heat-seekers can't lock. He's colder than the buildings around him.

421
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,975
福瑞迪，福瑞迪！福瑞迪！
Freddie. Freddie! Freddie!

422
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,020
- 怎么了？怎么了？ - 在被抓之前赶快跑啊
- What? What? - Let's go before we get caught.

423
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,105
吉米，你知道我的预感一向很准
Jimmy. You know that bad feeling I get...

424
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,316
尤其是什么不好的事情要发生时
...when something really bad is gonna happen?

425
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,485
我现在就有这种感觉，哥们
I'm getting that feeling right now, man.

426
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:25,164
- 下降300英尺,开启镭射光 - 目标11点钟方向
- Descend to 300 feet. Lasers on. - Target, 11 o'clock.

427
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,861
它去哪了？
Where'd he go?

428
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,331
埃寇战机，靠拢，伙计们，准备开火
Echo flight, get it together, guys. Prepare to fire.

429
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,751
- 4号机准备好 - 2号机准备好
- Echo 4, ready. - Echo 2, ready.

430
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,045
开火！
Fire!

431
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,982
我想我们击中它了
I think we got him.

432
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,788
我们丢了1号和2号机，长官
We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.

433
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,583
埃寇4号，目标在哪？
Echo 4, where is target?

434
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,590
天哪，它就在我后面，长官
Jesus! He's right on my tail, sir.

435
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,262
我甩不掉它
I don't think I can shake him.

436
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,941
我大概甩掉它了
I think I lost him.

437
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,159
4号…4号机也完了，长官
We've... We've lost Echo 4, sir.

438
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,996
你的人有毛病吗？
What's the matter with you people?

439
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,208
你们造成的损失比它还要大
You've caused more damage than that goddamn thing did!

440
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,920
- 消消气，吃块糖 - 别烦我，让我待会
- Calm down. Have some candy. - I don't want any. Leave me alone!

441
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,781
真难以置信
I can't believe it. I mean...

442
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,536
看着它为所欲为，我们却拿它没办法
He did all of this, and we did nothing to him.

443
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:13,457
也不是啊，起码我们喂饱了它
That's not true. We fed him.

444
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,713
这是新泽西指挥中心
Here at the command center in New Jersey...

445
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,882
没有什么新的进展
...there is no new information to report.

446
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:27,388
军方对外界进行了新闻封锁
The military has clamped a media blackout on whatever is going on.

447
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,348
目前得不到任何有关报导
Officials are not saying anything...

448
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:33,978
关于如何截留和控制怪兽的行动也一无所知
...about their attempts to contain or control this creature, and now I see...

449
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,273
情况已经得到控制
No, the situation is under control.

450
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,859
已经得到控制，我们有办法制伏它
It's under control, we have containment.

451
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,877
- 请问你要买药么？ - 是的
- Can I help you, young man? - Yes.

452
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,588
有妊娠试盒吗？
Do you have any at-home pregnancy tests?

453
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,675
那种含有生殖荷尔蒙…
Especially ones that look for gonadotropic hormones...

454
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,927
或者排卵激素的？
...or clomiphene citrate?

455
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,721
我不知道，这个…
I don't know. This...

456
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,597
这个…
This...

457
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,435
- 都在这里了 - 我都要
- This is all we've got. - I'll take all of them.

458
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,855
哇噢，你大概有许多妻妾
Wow, you must have quite some harem.

459
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:25,070
安琪，我的天，是你吗？你在这里做什么？
Audrey? Oh, my Go... Is that you? What are you doing here?

460
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,156
嗨，好啊
Hi. Hello.

461
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,075
- 哇！多少钱？ - 46美元
- Wow. How much is that? - $46.

462
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:34,371
上帝，你看上去…哦，近年来过的怎么样？
God, you look... Wow! How have you been?

463
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,665
见到你很高兴，尼克
It's good to see you, Nick.

464
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,128
- 你得偿所愿了 - 什么？
- So you made it. - What?

465
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,589
你成记者了，不是么？
You're a reporter, huh?

466
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,092
你一直想的就是做这个，我真高兴，真的
No, that's good. That's good. That's what you always wanted.

467
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:51,221
我真为你高兴，真的
I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

468
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,028
你还生我的气吗？
You're still mad at me?

469
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:10,866
你离开这么久一个电话，一封信都没有
Well, you left without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time.

470
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,787
是，我猜我还有点生气
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am still a little mad.

471
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,958
已经八年了，有些人会改变的
That was eight years ago. Some people change.

472
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,294
大多数人却不会变
Most people don't.

473
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:28,133
我很遗憾你这样想
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

474
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,430
安琪
Audrey.

475
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:41,021
你说得对，八年是很长的时间
You're right. Eight years is a long time.

476
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,065
可以请你喝杯茶吗？
Can I make you a cup of tea?

477
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,154
当然，太好了
Sure, that'd be nice.

478
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,198
我还是不能相信
I still can't believe it.

479
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,617
为什么一个反对核能应用的人
How does a guy go from anti-nuke activist...

480
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,829
和核能工作者一起工作？
...to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?

481
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,583
当你和我参加反核示威时
When you and I went to rallies together in college...

482
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,128
我们是想引起注意
...we helped to create awareness.

483
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:09,174
但现在，我能从内部引起真正的变化
But now, from the inside, I'm able to effect real change.

484
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,469
能有什么变化？
Exactly what changes are you trying to effect?

485
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,222
我在准备为政府做一个普查
I'm preparing a census for the government.

486
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,308
我将对所有因为核污染所产生的
I'm cataloging new species that have been created...

487
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,561
新物种进行分类
...as a direct result of nuclear contamination.

488
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,355
那就是其中之一吗？
Is that what you think created this thing?

489
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,650
是，我今天找到了一个血样
Yeah. I found a blood sample earlier this evening.

490
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,863
- 你离它很近？ - 非常近　
- How close did you get to the thing? - I got pretty close.

491
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:38,036
- 你还发现了什么？ - 我们知道它吃了成吨的鱼
- And what else did you find out? - Well, we know he eats tons of fish.

492
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:42,875
它是两栖动物，能够挖洞，并且…
He's amphibious. He's a burrower. And...

493
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,049
它怀孕了
...he's pregnant.

494
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,890
- 它怀孕？ - 对，会怀孕的雄性
- He is? - He's a very unusual he.

495
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,269
这些验孕药不是为它而设计的
I mean, obviously these tests weren't designed for this...

496
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:06,899
但对怀孕分泌荷尔蒙反应却完全一样
...but fundamentally they look for the same hormonal patterns...
...to indicate pregnancy.

497
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,236
我不明白，如果它是第一个，怎么怀孕呢？
I don't get it. If he's the first of his kind, how can he be pregnant?

498
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,779
它不需要配偶么？
Doesn't he need a mate?

499
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,948
它能无性繁殖
Not if he reproduces asexually.

500
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,910
怎么回事？
Where's the fun in that?

501
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:24,124
我一直在想，它为什么来这里
I kept thinking' why would he travel so far?

502
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,084
这就是充足的理由
But it makes perfect sense.

503
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:30,714
许多动物长途跋涉，就是为了繁殖
Lots of animals travel great distances for reproduction.

504
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,135
这就是它来这里的原因，它在筑巢
That's what he's doing in New York. He's nesting.

505
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,429
- 筑巢？ - 是的
- Nesting? - Yes.

506
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:42,601
你知道一个蜥蜴一次可下12个以上的蛋吗？
Do you realize that a lizard can lay up to 12 eggs at a time?

507
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,729
- 想想看 - 我不知道
- Think of it. - I didn't know that.

508
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:50,943
对不起，我要拿这个去实验室证实一下
Forgive me, I have to get this to the lab and see if I can confirm all this.

509
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,613
我一会就回来
I'll be right back.

510
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,198
来吧，宝贝，这里什么也没有
Come on, Joey' there's nothing down here.

511
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,367
我告诉你，伙计，我听到…
I'm telling you, man, I heard...

512
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,077
我听到些什么
I heard something.

513
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,038
你什么也不会听到，那是死胡同
You heard nothing. It's a dead end.

514
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,132
有什么么？
Anything?

515
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,137
什么也没有
No. Nothing down here.

516
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,640
一点都没有
Nothing at all.

517
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,444
这就是事情的由来
This is why, in this case, all the king's horses and all the king's men...

518
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,155
看来无论怎样也不能令纽约回复原状了
...may not be able to put the Big Apple together again.

519
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,907
安琪・迪曼兹，WIDF新闻
Audrey Timmonds, WIDF News.

520
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,117
好的！
Yes!

521
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,785
- 你要请我喝啤酒 - 喜欢么？
- You owe me a beer. - Like it?

522
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,745
- 好啊 - 我不应将头发放肩后
- Yeah. - I should've worn my hair back.

523
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,539
- 看起来挺好的 - 好的，好的
- No, it looks great. - Good, good.

524
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:54,292
你怎么拿到这些的？
How did you get ahold of this?

525
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:59,297
像你说的，好人办不成事
Well, you know. It's like you said, nice guys finish last.

526
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,967
- 谢谢，我爱你 - 太棒了
- Thank you. I love you. - Oh, yeah, sure.

527
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,427
怎么？
What...?

528
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:13,645
梅利！梅利！过来一下
Murray. Murray! Come here a second.

529
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,857
等一会，好么？怎么了？
Hold on a second, all right? What is it?

530
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:20,110
我有它袭击其他地方的资料
I've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked.

531
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,528
- 你确定？ - 是的
- You do? - Yeah.

532
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,322
- 谁的消息？ - 我的
- Whose story is that? - Mine.

533
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:38,003
大队人马移向那里
There's a lot of movement down there.

534
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,756
军队，警察…
Military, police...

535
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,927
- 这是我的早餐 - 我饿了
- It's my breakfast. - I'm hungry.

536
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,262
安静！
Quiet!

537
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,681
如果我们能将它引入开阔地
If we can lure him into a more open area...

538
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,727
比如说中央公园，我们就能制服它
...such as this portion of Central Park, we should be able to take him down.

539
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,646
- 上次你没伤着它一根毫毛 - 不对
- Last time you didn't even scratch it. - That's not true.

540
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,648
我的意思是，我的蚯蚓佬
My worm guy, I mean...

541
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:02,652
- 泰托・帕利斯博士取到了血 - 对，我拿到了
...Dr. Tatopoulos has found blood. - Yes, I did.

542
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,114
现在唯一需要做的就是引它去空旷处
See, the only thing we need to do is get him out into open terrain...

543
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:09,284
然后使用非热能跟踪武器
...and use weapons that don't rely on heat-seeking technology...

544
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:14,998
对不起，我认为现在情况更复杂了
Excuse me, sir. I think the situation has become more complicated than that.

545
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:20,212
我收集到的血样显示它要下蛋
The blood I collected revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs...

546
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,339
或者已经下了
...or already has.

547
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:26,218
你是说还有另一只吗？
Are you trying to tell us that there's another of those things out there?

548
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,845
不，我认为还没有
No, no, governor, I don't believe so.

549
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:32,557
等一下，等一下，那它怎么会怀孕？
Wait a minute, wait. Then how can it be pregnant?

550
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:35,018
它是什么？不是处女蜥蜴么？
What is this, the Virgin Lizard?

551
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,980
不，不，它会无性繁殖
No, no, it reproduces asexually.

552
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:42,526
所以我们要尽快找到它的巢穴
That's why we have to find the nest as soon as possible.

553
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,694
否则一旦十二个幼仔被孵化出来
Otherwise up to a dozen will be born...

554
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:48,740
它们又各自繁殖后代
...each one capable of laying eggs on its own.

555
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,743
它们的数量会非常迅速地增加
Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.

556
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,746
那么我们先干掉它，再寻找它的巢穴
So after we kill the creature, then we search for the nest.

557
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,040
不，我认为那可能就太晚了
No, I think it might be too late by then.

558
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,543
这些蛋很快就会孵化
These eggs are going to hatch very quickly.

559
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,379
- 你怎么知道这些？ - 是鱼
- How could you possibly know that? - The fish.

560
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,423
我发现在地铁里有鱼
The fish that we found on the subway.

561
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,385
那不是为它自己准备的
He's not collecting all this food just for himself.

562
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,263
它在为它的后代准备食物
He's preparing to feed his young.

563
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,143
有这个人的资料吗？
Do we have something on this guy?

564
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:23,233
尼克・塔…塔托教授
Professor Nick Ta... Tat... Tato...

565
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,611
他们叫他“蚯蚓佬”
They call him "the worm guy."

566
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,410
待在那里等我们的特别报导
Stay tuned for a special report.

567
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,121
你去哪儿啦？
Excuse us, please. Where you been?

568
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,790
- 就该到你了 - 哦，好啊
- Your spot is up right after this. - Oh, good.

569
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:44,254
- 能大点音量么？ - 请问能大点音量吗？
- Could you turn it up, please? - Can you turn it up, please? The TV?

570
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,466
如果泰托帕利斯博士说得对，我们就要抓紧行动，避免事态升级
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we have to act quickly, before this problem escalates.

571
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,803
你想根据一些不切实际的理论来分散我们的力量吗？
You want to divide our efferts based solely on some wild theory?

572
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,806
尼克帮助过我们
Sir, Nick's come through for us before, and if he feels...

573
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,642
帮助？上次行动简直是一场灾难
Come through for you? Your campaign's a disaster.

574
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,770
你竟然不能将这东西赶出曼哈顿
You weren't even able to keep this thing out of Manhattan.

575
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:04,482
打扰一下，先生们，我们应该看看这个
Excuse me, gentlemen, but I think we should see this.

576
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,029
曼哈顿的新害虫继续破坏
- Methods and motivations of Manhattan's newest unwanted pest.

577
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,826
哥斯拉
"Godzilla."

578
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:19,289
哥斯拉――日本船员称之为神话中的海龙
That's what Japanese sailors called him in song, a mythological sea dragon...

579
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,333
它使他们心中充满恐惧
...who filled their hearts with fear.

580
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,169
- 哦，天哪！他竟然偷了我的报导 - 是啊，我知道
- Oh, my God! He stole my report! - Yeah, I know.

581
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,880
如今神话成真，我们的都市面临劫难
That myth has become reality, our modern-day terror.

582
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,716
- 简直难以置信 - 哥斯拉是什么东西？
- I don't believe it! - Who is this Godzilla?

583
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,011
它从哪里来？它为什么来？
Where did he come from? Why is he here?

584
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,556
就是哥斯拉，你这傻瓜
And it's "Gojira, you moron!

585
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:40,477
已发现从曼哈顿到法属波利尼西亚的痕迹
A direct path can be traced from Manhattan to French Polynesia...

586
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,355
那里多年来进行核爆试验
...where nuclear tests have been going on for two decades.

587
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:47,609
泰托帕利斯博士认为那生物正在筑巢
Researcher Dr. Tapadopoulos believes the creature may be nesting...

588
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,904
利用曼哈顿的地势来传宗接代
...using Manhattan as ground zero to cultivate the species.

589
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:54,407
军方至今为止仍然否认
This, despite the fact that the combined might of the U.S. Military...

590
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,201
上述消息的真实性
...has been unable to subdue...

591
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,745
- 你向传媒透露这些？ - 不是　
- You went to the press with this? - No.

592
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:02,040
- 不，我没告诉任何人 - 他们都提到你的名字
- No, I haven't talked to anyone. - They mentioned you by name!

593
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,500
是啊，是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

594
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,420
- 你给他们磁带了？ - 不，我没给他们录像带
- You gave them the tape? - No, I didn't give them the tape.

595
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,423
它还在我的帐篷里
No, it's in my tent right now.

596
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,384
哦，我的天哪
Oh, my God.

597
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,886
哦，我的天哪，她拿去了！
Oh, my God, she took it.

598
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:22,102
卷铺盖回家吧，你不能继续这计划了
Pack your stuff, mister. You're officially off this project, as of now.

599
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,615
怎么啦？
What's going on?

600
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,453
我要走了
We're leaving.

601
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,796
这件事我很抱歉
I'm so sorry about all this.

602
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:58,096
一定要保证希克尽快找到巢穴
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest before it's too late.

603
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,765
我会尽力
I'll try.

604
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,279
什么意思？他不在那？
What do you mean, he's not there?

605
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,781
你刚刚说他在线上
A second ago you said he was on the other line.

606
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:20,493
紧急情况，是，尼克泰托・帕勒斯
Please, it's urgent. I really need to talk to him. Yes. Nick Tatopoulos.

607
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:37,343
你要走吗？为什么？
You're leaving? Why?

608
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,473
因为我的报导吗？
Is it because of me? Because of the story?

609
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,770
- 你以为会发生什么事？ - 你没有说是不能发表的
- What did you think would happen? - You never said it was off the record.

610
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:51,316
我认为不必说，安琪，我一直认为你是我的朋友
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You were supposed to be my friend.

611
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,109
我信任你
I trusted you.

612
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,200
尼克，有些事我想告诉你
Nick, there's something I have to tell you.

613
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:05,205
我撒谎了，我不是记者
Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter.

614
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:15,215
来纽约时，我肯定自己会成功
When we broke up and I first came out to New York, I was so sure I'd make it.

615
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,008
但我没做到
But I haven't.

616
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,387
所以我不惜一切抢头条
That's why I needed the story so bad.

617
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:24,224
我不能告诉你我是个失败者
I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

618
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,566
这样就可以偷我的录影带吗？
And you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?

619
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:37,987
不，那么做实在太过分了，我不该那样
No. It was a terrible thing to do. I never should've have done that.

620
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:49,082
祝你前程似锦，你很有天分
Good luck with your new career. I really think you have what it takes.

621
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,209
奈瓦克机场
Newark Airport.

622
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,762
对不起
I'm sorry.

623
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,394
嘿，原谅她一次吧，好么？
Hey, yo! Come on, give her a break, will you?

624
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,420
机场

625
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,634
这是去机场最近的路吗？
Excuse me, is this the best way to the airport?

626
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:51,769
先生，你去哪？喂！
Sir, where are you going? Hey, hello!

627
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:58,776
停车，停下，现在就婷！
Okay, stop. Stop the car, right now.

628
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,654
让我下车　
Now let me out of here.

629
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,534
恐怕我不能
I'm afraid I can't do that.

630
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,955
嘿，我认识你
Hey, I know you, don't I?

631
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,128
- 你是那保险人员 - 费利普・罗切探员
- Yeah. You're that insurance guy. - Agent Philippe Roaché.

632
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:19,468
DGSE

633
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,468
听起来很吓人
Sounds big.

634
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,555
法国安全局
French Secret Service.

635
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,977
你的美国朋友们
I thought you'd like to know that your American friends...

636
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:36,189
决定不再找它的巢穴
...have decided not to look for the creature's nest.

637
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,317
什么？你怎么知道？
What? Are you sure? How do you know that?

638
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,403
- 我们知道，相信我 - 相信你？
- We know. Trust me. - Trust you?

639
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,490
你协持我，还叫我相信你？
You hijack me and you expect me to trust you?

640
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,034
- 是 - 为什么我要相信你？
- Yes. - And why should I do that?

641
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:54,499
因为只有我们希望找到巢穴
Because you are the only one who wants to find the nest as much as I do.

642
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,528
你怎样运这些入境？
How did you get all this stuff into the country?

643
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,281
这是美国，什么都买得到
This is America. You can buy anything.

644
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,533
但是为什么秘密行动？
But why all the secrecy?

645
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,077
你们为什么不和美军合作？
Why aren't you guys working with the U.S. Military?

646
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:34,330
我不能谈论这些事
I'm not permitted to speak of such things.

647
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:39,043
你说你需要我的信任，但我也需要你的
Hey, you said you needed my trust. Well, then I need yours.

648
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:45,091
我是爱国者，我爱我的国家，你明白吗？
I am a patriot. I love my country. You understand that?

649
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,592
当然
Sure.

650
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,803
我有责任保卫我的国家
It's my job to protect my country.

651
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:53,641
尽管有时他也犯一些错误
Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we've made.

652
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,686
不能让人知道的错误
Mistakes that we don't want the world to know about.

653
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,939
- 太平洋的核爆试验？ - 对　
- The nuclear tests in the Pacific? - Yes.

654
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,401
他们留下一堆烂摊子
This testing done by my country left a terrible mess.

655
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,987
要我们收拾
We're here to clean it up.

656
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,400
- 有新闻吗？ - 没有　

657
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,751
他们好像要在晚上8点左右再次设置鱼饵陷阱
They are setting the next fish trap at 8-something.

658
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:25,590
我们知道如何进入城市，但不知道如何找到它们
We know how to get into the city' we just don't know where to look.

659
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,309
这儿，第二十三街地铁站
Here. This is the 23rd Street subway station.

660
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:40,271
找到鱼的地方，应该从这里开始找
That's where we first found the fish. That'd a good place to start looking.

661
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,106
你会加入吗？
So you're in?

662
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:49,487
- 对，对，我加入 - 太棒了　
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

663
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,868
我总想加入法国海外兵团
I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.

664
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:06,964
- 你好 - 进展怎么样？
- Hello. - How's it going?

665
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,017
对不起，借过，对不起
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

666
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,645
- 甜心 - 嘿，宝贝
- Honey. - Hi, sweetie.

667
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,189
- 这些是什么人？ - 什么？
- Who the hell are all these people? - What?

668
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:26,401
我不能让他们睡在街上
I couldn't just let them sleep on the street.

669
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,198
- 安琪在哪？ - 在卧室里
- Where's Audrey? - In the bedroom.

670
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,159
- 快哭死了，就是因为你  - 我？
- Crying her eyes out because of you. - Me?

671
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,661
我做什么了？
What did I do?

672
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,497
你教她要不择手段向上爬的
All that "You gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.

673
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,667
- 这也算啊 - 你快点进去安慰她
- Get out of here! - Go in there and talk to her right now.

674
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,044
这个我也不拿手啊，借过
Is it being with you? Excuse me.

675
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,255
和一些报告相反
Contrary to some frivolous reporting...

676
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:51,676
没有什么可使我们相信
...we have absolutely no information whatsoever to make us believe...

677
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,804
城中有怪兽下的蛋
...that there are any eggs of the creature in the city.

678
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:59,559
大家不需要恐慌，重复，大家不需要恐慌
There's no need for panic. Repeat, there's no reason to panic.

679
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,771
都是我的错
It's all my fault.

680
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:08,192
我做了什么，禽兽？我怎么会变成这样？
What have I done, Animal? What have I become?

681
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,071
看看，这不是我，我做不出这种事的
Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do stuff like this.

682
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,615
你犯了错，每个人都会犯错
You made a mistake. All right? It happens.

683
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,868
是的，可是…
Yeah, well...

684
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:21,038
我令唯一会关心我的人失望
...I just totally screwed up with the only man who will ever care about me.

685
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,875
那你想做些什么来补偿吗？
If I told you you could make it all up to him, would you?

686
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,543
我当然想
Of course I would.

687
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:31,382
他在街上离开你后，我就跟着他
Get this. After he left you in the street, I kind of followed him.

688
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,093
我想和他说清楚
I figured I'd talk some sense into the guy.

689
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,596
借过他却被带进一间仓库
Next thing I know, he pulls into this warehouse...

690
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,891
里面全是穿军装的法国乡巴佬
...with all these French wackos in military outfits.

691
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,727
他们要溜进城里
They wanna try to sneak back into the city tonight.

692
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,605
他们要去找怪兽的巢穴
They're going after the nest.

693
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,484
如果他们找到了，你能让全世界明白…
If he finds it, I think you should be the one to let the whole world know...

694
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,194
他一直是对的
...that he was right all along.

695
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,280
你想我跟踪他？
You want me to follow him into the city?

696
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,450
对，我们俩
Yeah, we both will.

697
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:02,997
- 来吧，会很好玩的 - 不，我已经搞得一团糟
- Come on, it'll be fun, it'll be fun. - I already made a mess of everything.

698
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,999
是啊，那更需要你去做了，安琪
Yeah, you really did, Audrey.

699
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,586
听着，我会跟踪他，跟不跟我走，随你的便
Listen, I'm going after him. You can go with me, or not. Okay?

700
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:17,762
- 你在干什么？ - 卢西要伤害我
- What are you doing? - Can't let Lucy know. She'll hurt me.

701
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,823
吃口香糖干什么？
What's with the chewing gum?

702
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,244
这样更像美国人
It makes us look more American.

703
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,995
哦，真的吗？
Oh, really?

704
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,460
让我来说话，行吗？
Just let me do all the talking. All right?

705
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,633
没挂上挡
It's not in gear.

706
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,687
跟着我，这边走
Follow me. This way.

707
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,859
- 你没事吧？ - 没事
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

708
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,495
来吧
Come on.

709
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,163
这是什么地方？
What is this place?

710
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:29,375
这是地铁隧道的通风口
It's a vent that leads down to the subway tunnels underneath.

711
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,837
直通第二十三街地铁站
It should take us right to the 23rd Street station in Manhattan.

712
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:39,010
你在开玩笑吧，那儿有老鼠吗？
You gotta be kidding me. Aren't there rats and stuff down here?

713
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:45,349
我更注意蜥蜴，又大又丑又讨厌的蜥蜴
I'm more concerned about lizards. Big, ugly, nasty, large lizards.

714
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,994
你们隶属哪个部队？
Who are you boys with?

715
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:10,708
- 我们隶属三十二部队，长官 - 我没问你，小兵
- We're with the 3-2, sir. - I didn't ask you, soldier.

716
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,836
上士欧尼尔刚刚呼叫我们
Well, Sergeant O'Neal just called down for us.

717
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,589
他想让我们归队，谢谢
He wants us to join him right now. Sir. Thank you.

718
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:23,471
- 你说话有困难吗？ - 没有，长官，我很好
- Have you got a problem talking? - Why, no, sir. I'm fine.

719
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,724
来吧，我们走！
Come on, let's go!

720
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:31,687
- 好的，继续前进 - 非常感谢
- All right. Keep it moving. - Thank you very much.

721
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:41,572
埃尔维斯・泊斯里电影，他是最棒的
Elvis Presley movies. He was the king.

722
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,748
- 长官，欧尼尔的电话 - 欧尼尔，你收到吗？　
- Sir, O'Neal on the line. - O'Neal, do you read me?

723
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:57,588
- 收到 - 情况如何？
- O'Neal. - How are we doing?

724
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:01,592
情况很好，一切按计划进行
So far, so good. We're right on schedule.

725
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:06,347
情况很好，情况很…好
We're good. We're... We're good.

726
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,406
- 噢，天啊 - 好啊
- Oh, my God! - Yeah.

727
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,450
他们在那里，关掉灯，关掉灯
There they are. Kill your light. Kill your light.

728
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,455
快点，我们怎么下去？快追不上他们了
Come on, how do we get down there? We're gonna lose them.

729
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,426
- 他们怎样下去的？ - 我不知道　
- How did they get down there? - I don't know.

730
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,805
你认为他们是顺这爬下的吗？
You don't think they climbed down this thing?

731
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,473
哦，天哪
Oh, Jesus!

732
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:08,075
小心
Careful.

733
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,875
- 拉我一把 - 好的
- Give me your hand. - I got you.

734
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,306
- 你听见吗？ - 什么？
- Do you hear that? - What?

735
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:15,434
它来了，快走！
Animal, come on!

736
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,185
我想应该是这边
I guess we go this way.

737
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:20,583
我们将它定位在第五区
We've spotted him in section five.

738
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,752
进入作战状态，我们上！
Combat positions. Here we go!

739
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:31,468
目标北上第五区
Target's heading north to section five.

740
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:36,974
等它进入公园才开火
Do not fire until he has cleared the buildings and enters the park!

741
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:44,320
2号鱼堆 中央公园

742
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,312
等它进入公园
Wait until he enters the park.

743
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,204
来吧
Come on.

744
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:31,714
它要走了，该死的，开火！自由开火！
He's leaving! Damn it! Fire! Fire at will!

745
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:40,514
妈的！
Damn!

746
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,652
开火！
Fire!

747
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,617
做躲避动作！
Fly to evasive maneuvers.

748
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:11,962
目标逃向西部高速公路
The target is in the clear and headed towards the West Side Highway.

749
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,442
别担心，海军正在那里等它
Don't worry. The Navy has a little something there waiting for him.

750
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,703
- 全体准备战斗 - 进入指定区域
- All stations manned for battle. - At ordered depth, sir.

751
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,789
好，声纳探测到它，犹他号驶近
We have him on sonar. Utah closing in.

752
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:48,832
做好最后准备，准备开火
Make final preparations, prepare to fire.

753
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:01,011
- 是，是，准备就位 - 鱼雷准备就位
- Aye, aye, manned and ready. - Torpedo room manned and ready.

754
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,472
- 最终定位瞄准，确认目标锁定 - 是
- Final bearing and shoot. - Are we locked on?

755
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:06,917
- 锁定目标了么？
- Are we locked on?

756
01:25:06,917 --> 01:25:09,353
- 已锁定，舰长 - 1号鱼雷，准备
- Locked on, captain. - Number one, stand by.

757
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:12,940
- 发射 - 鱼雷1号发射
- Fire. - Torpedo one left the tube.

758
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:27,538
印第安纳和阿科瑞基正靠近目标物
Indiana and Anchorage closing in.

759
01:25:27,705 --> 01:25:31,208
- 少尉，情况如何？ - 已锁定并接近目标，长官
- Ensign, what's the status? - We are locked on and closing in, sir.

760
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:32,835
发射1号鱼雷
Fire number one.

761
01:25:53,815 --> 01:25:57,526
- 目标向我们冲来 - 全速后退
- Sir! The target's heading right at us! - All back full!

762
01:25:57,694 --> 01:26:00,237
是，是，长官，全速后退
Aye, aye, sir. All back full.

763
01:26:07,745 --> 01:26:10,706
10秒内撞击
Stand by for impact. In 10 seconds.

764
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:18,964
6、5、4…
Six, five, four...

765
01:26:19,132 --> 01:26:22,092
…3、2、1
...three, two, one.

766
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:39,840
失去联系

767
01:26:41,738 --> 01:26:44,031
阿科瑞基号完了，长官
We've lost the Anchorage, sir.

768
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:54,958
它改变路线了，长官
He's shifted course, sir.

769
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:58,503
- 它掉头移向曼哈顿 - 全速前进，接近，锁定
- He's headed back towards Manhattan. - Full ahead. Close in, lock on.

770
01:26:58,671 --> 01:27:01,840
- 准备3号、4号鱼雷 - 是，长官
- Prepare tubes three and four, lock on. - Aye, aye, sir.

771
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:12,935
- 准备，3号，发射！ - 鱼雷3号发射完毕
- Stand by, three. Fire. - Torpedo three cleared and left the tube.

772
01:27:19,484 --> 01:27:22,861
8秒后命中，7、6…
Impact in eight seconds. Seven, six...

773
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:31,995
3、2、1
Three, two, one.

774
01:27:39,045 --> 01:27:41,505
- 直接命中 - 打中了
- Direct hit! - Got him.

775
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:45,676
- 祝贺你，长官 - 干得好　
- Congratulations, sir. - Good job.

776
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:48,845
好啊，干得好
Yeah, well done.

777
01:28:29,387 --> 01:28:31,555
上面有什么？
What's up there?

778
01:28:54,454 --> 01:28:56,913
很香的味道
This is a good smell.

779
01:28:59,917 --> 01:29:03,795
安琪，你看，它踩烂了麦迪逊广场
Audrey, look at this. He trashed the Garden.

780
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,883
哦，天哪，我现在很生气
Oh, man! Now I'm pissed.

781
01:29:09,802 --> 01:29:12,512
- 是这吗？ - 对
- Is that them? - Yeah.

782
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:52,135
三个蛋，我想还会更多
Three eggs. I thought there'd be more.

783
01:29:52,303 --> 01:29:54,388
你说得对
And you were right.

784
01:30:06,234 --> 01:30:07,984
哦，我的…
Oh, my.

785
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:13,031
这里有超过二十只蛋
There's gotta be more than 20 eggs here.

786
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:15,534
好像更多
Way more.

787
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,360
危险 高压

788
01:30:35,012 --> 01:30:37,222
数一数
Start counting.

789
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:52,571
- 可不可以扶我一把？ - 好，你没事吧？
- Could you help me? - Yeah, you all right?

790
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,033
那里
There.

791
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,225
我们的炸药不够
We don't have enough explosives.

792
01:31:23,258 --> 01:31:24,225
该死

793
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,819
他们在干什么？
What the hell are they doing?

794
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:10,732
尼克，我们有麻烦
Nick, we have a problem.

795
01:32:47,019 --> 01:32:49,729
哦，我的天，我的天！
Oh, my God. My God!

796
01:32:49,897 --> 01:32:51,773
来啊，快走吧！
Come on. Let's go!

797
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:55,652
等等，好么？等等，真难以置信
One second, all right? One second. This is unbelievable.

798
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:11,459
还拍不够吗？
Don't you think we have enough already?

799
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,169
我只想…
I just want...

800
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,177
好的，不错，已经足够了
Yeah, that's good for me. That's plenty.

801
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,808
我们应该…
We should...

802
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,859
不要…
Just let's not...

803
01:33:36,235 --> 01:33:38,069
…骚扰它们
...startle it.

804
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:49,372
我们闻起来像鱼
We smell like the fish.

805
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:52,542
- 我想我们现在应该离开 - 我认为是个好主意
- I think we should leave now. - I think that's a good idea.

806
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:21,321
快点！
Come on!

807
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:31,539
- 都出去，快点！ - 快点，我们走！
- Everybody outside! Now! - Come on. Let's go.

808
01:34:47,598 --> 01:34:53,520
关上门，不能让它们出去，走！
Lock the doors now! We have to keep them contained inside. Let's go!

809
01:35:54,457 --> 01:35:57,375
- 你看见那道门吗？ - 好，数到三
- You see that? - All right. On three.

810
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,043
三！
Three!

811
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,892
这是尼克队洗澡的地方
This is where the Knicks get showered and everything.

812
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:23,401
很好，现在怎么办？
Great. Now what do we do?

813
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:28,823
我们在林肯地铁隧道的新泽西出口外面
I'm standing just outside the Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.

814
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:33,703
成千的愤怒的难民要求回到市区
Thousands of angry refugees are demanding to be let back into the city.

815
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,956
所有通向市区的道路都堵塞了
All major arteries into the city are clogged with Manhattanites...

816
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:38,875
为打败哥斯拉而庆祝的人们
...who are jubilant that Godzilla...

817
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:40,919
是的，是的，我知道
Yes, yes, I understand.

818
01:36:41,086 --> 01:36:44,506
- 许多电话打进你的办公室找你 - 我知道　
- Your office is swamped with calls. - I know, I know!

819
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:46,883
你知道这里发生了什么么？
Do you have any idea what's going on out there?

820
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:50,386
电话快打爆了，市民强烈要求回家
Phones are ringing off the hook. People are screaming to be let back in.

821
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:52,722
潜水员在寻找尸体
We're sending divers into the river for the body.

822
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,766
那东西已经死了，你还在等什么？
That thing's dead. What are you waiting for?

823
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,436
上校，上校，我们要找到巢穴
Colonel. Colonel, we've gotta start a search for the nest.

824
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:00,355
爱丝，我们已经讨论过这事
We've been through this already.

825
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:03,066
如果尼克对了会怎样？
What if Nick is right, and we blow this whole thing?

826
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,194
这是我们最后的机会
This could be the only chance we have to do something about it.

827
01:37:10,032 --> 01:37:12,075
上尉，组织一个搜查小组
Captain, organize a search party.

828
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:15,286
我要搜查全城和地铁
I want a complete sweep of the entire city and the subway.

829
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,580
你没有权力那样做
You don't have the authority to do that.

830
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:19,791
你试试来阻拦我
Try and stop me.

831
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:36,891
叫军方派轰炸机来炸毁这大厦
Contact the military. Get them to send a bomber to blow up this building.

832
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:41,312
- 怎样联络他们？ - 555-7600
- How do I do that? - 555-7600.

833
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,899
告诉他们暗号是蜻蜓，那就会允许你通话
Tell them it's a Code Dragonfly. That should get you through.

834
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:49,821
- 你还在等什么？ - 555什么？
- What are you waiting for? - 555 what?

835
01:37:49,989 --> 01:37:54,742
- 7600 - 7600
- 7600. - 7600.

836
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:01,457
- 所有线路都占线 - 打不通　　
- All circuits are busy right now. - It's busy.

837
01:38:01,625 --> 01:38:02,750
再拨
Try again.

838
01:38:13,512 --> 01:38:14,846
他们说什么
What did they say?

839
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:18,975
打不通，我不知道怎么回事
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.

840
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:23,563
上层的门已被锁上
We secured the doors on the upper levels.

841
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,940
琼・费利普和琼・皮尔呢？
Where are Jean-Philippe and Jean-Pierre?

842
01:38:26,108 --> 01:38:27,317
他们没跑掉
They didn't make it.

843
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:34,741
尼克，我们在这儿挡住它们，你去呼救
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You'll have to go and get help.

844
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,929
你认为我们能上去吗？
You think we could fit up in there?

845
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,975
只有这个办法
There's one way to find out.

846
01:39:01,685 --> 01:39:05,021
推我上去，推我上去
Boost me up. Boost me up.

847
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:20,073
大事不好，大事不好
This is not good. This is not good.

848
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:33,169
快点，快点
Come on, come on.

849
01:41:38,008 --> 01:41:39,842
快点
Come on.

850
01:42:08,872 --> 01:42:10,456
这层不行
Wrong floor.

851
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,717
我们为什么不走这边？
Why don't we go this way?

852
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:46,742
- 是我，是我 - 怎么啦？
- It's me. It's me. - What happened?

853
01:42:46,910 --> 01:42:49,912
它们冲出来了，到处都是，我出不去
They're loose. They're all over the place. I couldn't get out.

854
01:42:50,080 --> 01:42:51,706
没人能出去了
No one can get out.

855
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:59,172
- 你到底是谁？ - 安琪？
- Who the hell are you? - Audrey?

856
01:43:01,091 --> 01:43:02,884
这里
Here.

857
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,430
- 你没事吧？ - 应该是吧.
- Are you all right? - I think so.

858
01:43:07,598 --> 01:43:09,682
- 不准摄影！ - 你开玩笑…
- No cameras. - Are you kid...?

859
01:43:09,850 --> 01:43:11,851
哦，好的，非常好
Yeah, all right. Very good.

860
01:43:12,102 --> 01:43:16,397
你有无线电步话机吗？或者其他可以联系到外界的东西？
Do you have a radio or walkie-talkie? Anything to contact the outside?

861
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:20,026
- 电话呢？ - 全占线
- What about the phones? - The circuits are all jammed.

862
01:43:20,527 --> 01:43:24,447
等等，我有办法和外面联络
Wait. I know how we can get a message to the outside.

863
01:43:33,081 --> 01:43:34,373
这边，来吧
This way. Come on.

864
01:43:37,836 --> 01:43:40,213
录影带！录影带！
The tape. The tape!

865
01:43:46,803 --> 01:43:47,929
快点！
Come on!

866
01:44:02,361 --> 01:44:03,986
快点，快点
Come on. Come on.

867
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:07,156
- 播放室在这里 - 你如何知道？
- The broadcast booth is over here. - How do you know that?

868
01:44:07,324 --> 01:44:10,159
我们在这报导过冰上曲棍球比赛
Our network covers the Ranger games.

869
01:44:12,246 --> 01:44:14,413
- 锁上了 - 等等，有密码
- It's locked. - There's a code. There's a code.

870
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:17,500
快点！快点！
Come on. Come on!

871
01:44:22,756 --> 01:44:24,465
我都快成功了
I was just about to get it.

872
01:44:24,633 --> 01:44:28,427
这是内部网络，可以直接连接上我们的转播系统
The network's on an intranet. It's a direct feed to our computer system.

873
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:32,014
你们的转播信息军方应该可以看到
Your station won't have any easier time reaching the military than I did.

874
01:44:32,182 --> 01:44:35,184
你是说我们所有的电视节目他们都能看到？
When you worked with them, did they monitor all news broadcasts?

875
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:37,186
是的，是的，他们可以
Yeah. Yeah, they did.

876
01:44:37,354 --> 01:44:41,399
好，现场直播，安琪，我们就在这里播
All right, we'll go live. Audrey' we'll broadcast right from in here.

877
01:44:41,566 --> 01:44:46,320
- 希望他们看到 - 我要传出这消息
- Hopefully they'll see it. - I'll try to get a message through.

878
01:44:58,375 --> 01:45:00,793
这场灾难带给这座城市巨大的浩劫
Let's not forget in our rush to return to the city...

879
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:03,587
许多人因此改变了一生
...that many people have had their lives changed forever.

880
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:07,133
人人都受到震撼…
No one in the city has been untouched by the frenzy...

881
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:11,178
病人、伤员都需要我们的帮助
The sick, the displaced, the injured all need our help...

882
01:45:11,690 --> 01:45:15,630
埃德，接受CFX1频段，观看消息

883
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:18,060
今晚没有球赛
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

884
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:26,235
埃德，如果你看到这个，请替我们直播，情况紧急！
Ed, if you're seeing this, will you please put us on live? It's urgent!

885
01:45:26,903 --> 01:45:29,613
我知道这不合规矩，埃德，但必须这样
I know this sounds crazy, Ed, but you have to do it.

886
01:45:31,908 --> 01:45:35,953
- 请相信我 - 我才不会让你直播
- Please, just trust me. - I'm not putting you on live.

887
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:38,998
- 我不认为他会干 - 他会的
- I don't think he's gonna do it. - Yes, he will.

888
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:42,376
好吧，埃德，看看
All right, Ed? Come on.

889
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:49,467
看到了么，埃德，如果不阻止它们，它们会踏平城市
See that, Ed? They're gonna be all over the city if we don't stop them.

890
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,428
等我一下
Give me a second, will you?

891
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:02,188
- 是回家的时候了 - 准备好潜水艇
- Finally it's time to return home. - Get the diving boats ready.

892
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:05,316
我们的恐慌逐渐消退…
Our fears have been allayed...

893
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:08,778
…感谢我们军队中的英雄们
...thanks to the heroic efforts of our boys in uniform.

894
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:10,613
播出了吗？
Are we on?

895
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:15,242
- 是的，播出了，你在上面 - 已经播出了？
- Yeah, good, you're on. - Are we live?

896
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:17,370
是的，是的，已经播出了，开始
Yes, yes. You're on. Go!

897
01:46:18,121 --> 01:46:20,289
我们在麦迪逊广场花园内部进行直播…
We're live inside Madison Square Garden...

898
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:23,876
在这里泰托・帕利斯博士发现了怪兽的巢穴
...where Niko Dr. Tatopoulos has discovered the beast's lair.

899
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:26,545
博士，请告诉我们这里发生了什么
Doctor, can you please tell us what's happening here?

900
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:31,634
- 到你了，是的，上，上 - 谢谢
- That's you. Yes, go, go. - Thank you.

901
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:35,721
哦，是的，我们发现了200多个蛋…
Yeah, well, we've discovered over 200 eggs...

902
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:37,681
去找希克！找希克！
Go get Hicks. Get Hicks!

903
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:40,643
它们刚刚从蛋壳中孵化而出
...which, a few moments ago, began hatching.

904
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:45,689
尽管刚孵出，它们却有九英尺高
The creatures, though just hatched, are over 9 feet tall...

905
01:46:45,857 --> 01:46:48,150
并且它们已开始进食
...and they've begun feeding.

906
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:52,405
如果这里存储的食物吃完了…
When their food supply runs out here...

907
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:56,992
…它们就会走出巢穴出去找食物
...they will attempt to hunt down food of their own outside of this nest.

908
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,994
哦，我的天哪
Oh, my God.

909
01:46:59,162 --> 01:47:03,332
如果它们能出去，就会大量繁殖，一个新物种就产生了
If they get out, they'll multiply, and very soon a new species will emerge.

910
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:08,337
一个可以取代我们人类的物种
One that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet.

911
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:13,092
这些两栖类动物出生时就怀孕了
Each one of these amazing reptiles are born pregnant.

912
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:19,598
200个一年就会变成40000个
Adaptive and cunning, these 200 could become 40,000 within this year.

913
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:22,143
如军方听见这消息…
If the military is listening to this broadcast...

914
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:24,979
…应立即摧毁这座大厦…
...they have to destroy this building immediately...

915
01:47:25,147 --> 01:47:26,981
…不能让这些生物逃走
...before these creatures can escape.

916
01:47:33,321 --> 01:47:35,990
目前为止，它们现在困在这建筑里…
So far, they're all trapped inside this building...

917
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,868
..但我们不能支撑很久
...but I don't think we can contain them for long.

918
01:47:39,035 --> 01:47:44,373
它们很强壮，灵巧，正在找食物
They're very strong, they're agile, and they're looking for food.

919
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,876
这样一来，你的怪兽孵化理论…
So I guess your theory of the creature nesting...

920
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:49,253
…最终被证明是对的
...turned out to be correct after all.

921
01:47:51,339 --> 01:47:54,884
不管我们会怎样，最重要的是…
Regardless of what happens to us, the most important thing...

922
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:57,428
…必须在它们逃出之前…
...is that this building be destroyed immediately...

923
01:47:57,596 --> 01:47:59,305
…摧毁这座楼
...before they can escape into the city.

924
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,724
曼迪逊广场花园现场报导…
Reporting live from Madison Square Garden...

我命令你摧毁曼迪逊广场花园
I want you to blow up Madison Square Garden.

930
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,830
你们成功了，军方说给你们六分钟逃出

931
01:48:38,136 --> 01:48:40,304
好的，好消息是他们收到消息了
Well, the good news is they got that message.

932
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:44,558
坏消息是我们必须在六分钟内逃出去
The bad news is we've got less than six minutes to get out of the building.

933
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:47,645
好吧，晚会结束了，该跑了
Okay, the party's over. Time to leave.

942
01:49:46,037 --> 01:49:47,871
快，尼克,这边

我会习惯的
I'd like to find out.

960

哦，天哪！

1015

02:06:12,314 --> 02:06:16,192
那是我的丈夫！那是我的丈夫！
That's my husband! That's my husband!

1031
02:06:16,402 --> 02:06:19,696
哦，天…我要杀了他
Oh, my... I'm gonna kill him.

1032
02:06:26,537 --> 02:06:30,623
哦，我的，哦，天哪，哦，不
Oh, my. Oh, God. Oh, no.

1033
02:06:36,338 --> 02:06:39,632
等等，我们可以利用这个机会
Wait. We can use this.

1034
02:06:39,800 --> 02:06:43,261
- “是市长消灭了哥斯拉” - 我认为我们不能利用这个
- "The mayor who destroyed Godzilla." - I don't think we should exploit this.

1035
02:06:43,429 --> 02:06:45,388
- 会有副作用的 - 听着，白痴
- It could backfire. - Listen to me, idiot.

1036
02:06:45,556 --> 02:06:48,891
我说可以就可以，白痴，这主意绝佳
I do the thinking here, you idiot. It's a magnificent idea.

1037
02:06:49,059 --> 02:06:51,894
你知道我对你和你的竞选有什么看法吗？
You know what I think about you and your campaign?

1038
02:06:53,439 --> 02:06:55,398
吉恩，你要去哪？我需要你
Gene, where you going? I need you.

1039
02:06:56,400 --> 02:06:57,984
欧尼尔，听见吗？
O'Neal, do you read me?

1040
02:06:59,320 --> 02:07:01,279
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1041
02:07:01,447 --> 02:07:03,948
干得漂亮，士兵
That's one hell of a job, soldier.

1042
02:07:05,034 --> 02:07:07,577
干得太漂亮了
That's one hell of a job.

1043
02:07:11,582 --> 02:07:13,833
是的，长官
Roger that, sir.

1044
02:07:15,878 --> 02:07:19,922
对不起,我已答应接受…
Sorry, folks, I've already promised my story as an exclusive...

1045
02:07:20,090 --> 02:07:22,508
…另一个记者的独家访问
...to another reporter.

1046
02:07:22,676 --> 02:07:27,847
我们成功了，这是独家！安琪，你太漂亮了
We did it! We got the exclusive! Audrey, you're beautiful.

1047
02:07:28,015 --> 02:07:32,185
- 我们？我认为不是 - 记住，你为我工作
- We did? I don't think so. - Remember, you work for me.

1048
02:07:32,353 --> 02:07:36,397
再也不了，我不干了
Not anymore, Chuck. I quit.

1049
02:07:38,233 --> 02:07:42,195
- 但你… - 她不干了
- But you... - She quits.

1050
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:53,706
安琪，安琪
Audrey. Audrey.

1051
02:07:54,500 --> 02:07:56,250
你拿了那磁带吗？
Did you take the tape from the camera?

1052
02:07:56,418 --> 02:07:57,585
没有
No.

1053
02:07:57,753 --> 02:08:01,339
- 不可能不见了 - 费利普在哪？
- I mean, I couldn't have just lost it. - Where's Philippe?

1054
02:08:10,766 --> 02:08:12,934
喂？喂？
Hello? Hello?

1055
02:08:13,102 --> 02:08:16,104
- 是费利普 - 你在哪里？
- It's Philippe. - Where are you?

1056
02:08:16,271 --> 02:08:18,064
告诉你的朋友…
Tell you friend I'll send the tape...

1057
02:08:18,232 --> 02:08:20,483
…我抹去一些内容后会将带子寄给你
...after I've removed a few items from it.

1058
02:08:20,651 --> 02:08:24,153
- 明白 - 我要说再见了
- I understand. - I just wanted to say au revoir.

1059
02:08:24,321 --> 02:08:27,949
谢谢你们的帮助，朋友
Thank you for your help, my friend.

1060
02:08:29,535 --> 02:08:32,120
等等…喂？
Well, wait... Hello?

1061
02:08:43,549 --> 02:08:45,883
那法国佬是什么人？
Who was that French guy anyway?

1062
02:08:46,468 --> 02:08:48,845
就是个保险员
Just some insurance guy.

1063
02:08:50,806 --> 02:08:53,641
他拿了我…他有提起录影带吗？
Did he take my...? Did he say anything about my tape?

1064
02:08:53,892 --> 02:08:56,102
是的，他说了一些关于你录像带的事
Yeah, he said something about your tape.

1065
02:08:56,270 --> 02:09:00,648
- 他拿了我的录像带？ - 是的，他拿了你的录像带
- Does he have my tape? - Yeah, he has your tape.

1066
02:09:00,816 --> 02:09:03,151
你会拿回来的
You'll get it back.
