I have a permit.''

00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,161
- Dr. Niko TapopopoIis? - TatopouIos.

6
00:07:12,247 --> 00:07:15,319
''KyIe Terrington, I'm with
the U.S. State Department.''

7
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:20,480
- What are they doing? -
You're being reassigned.

8
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:24,162
- But my work here isn't finished.
- It is now.

00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,001
There's pressure from the Americans.

11
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,318
- What have you toId them?
- Nothing yet.

12
00:07:56,407 --> 00:08:02,482
''- Are there any survivors? -
OnIy one, sir. He was Iucky.''

13
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:12,637
- Get them out. - PIease ..

14
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,320
Ask him what happened.

15
00:08:42,807 --> 00:08:44,798
''What did you see, oId man?''

16
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:53,799
Gojira.

00:09:10,407 --> 00:09:12,159
That's affirmative.

00:09:13,807 --> 00:09:16,719
''Hey, where are you going
with my stuff?''

20
00:09:17,007 --> 00:09:22,798
HeIIo. HeIIo .. That's very deIicate.

21
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:28,322
- Dr. Niko TopodopeIess? - TatopouIos.

22
00:09:28,807 --> 00:09:30,877
Get these peopIe off of the pier.

23
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:35,002
''- Sir, what am I doing here?
- Just watch your step.''

24
00:09:35,727 --> 00:09:38,161
Get them off the pier!

25
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:44,238
- Is this some kind of spiII?
- Something Iike that.

26
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:49,642
''I work for the N.R.C., but accidents
and spills aren't my fieId.''

27
00:09:49,727 --> 00:09:50,876
We know.

28
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:56,561
''- You interrupted my worm project.
- Yeah, you're the worm guy, right?''

29
00:09:56,647 --> 00:10:01,721
The spiII in ChernobyI has mutated
the earthworm's DNA.

30
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:04,999
- You know what that means? -
I think I'm about to find out.

31
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:12,004
''Because of the accident, the worms
are now 17% Iarger than normal.''

32
00:10:12,087 --> 00:10:15,238
- Sounds pretty big.
- They're enormous.

33
00:10:15,327 --> 00:10:20,401
I'm a bioIogist. I take radioactive
sampIes and study them.

34
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:24,719
- Here's your sampIe. Study
it. - What sampIe?

35
00:10:25,807 --> 00:10:29,641
- You're standing in it.
- I don't see it.

36
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:33,486
Where is it?

37
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,159
I don't see it.

38
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:47,406
CoIoneI!

39
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:53,638
I was standing inside a footprint!

40
00:10:53,727 --> 00:10:54,796
That's right.

41
00:10:55,087 --> 00:11:00,639
''There's no animaI in the worId that
makes footprints that big, is there?''

42
00:11:00,727 --> 00:11:04,322
''I toId them this isn't your fieId,
but they never Iisten to genius.''

43
00:11:04,407 --> 00:11:08,719
''This is EIsie Chapman, the
paIeontoIogist. She's your boss.''

44
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:13,716
''Those were footprints, right?
Did anybody see what made them?''

45
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:18,005
ActuaIIy .. no such Iuck.

46
00:11:18,407 --> 00:11:21,001
Nobody knew what hit them
untiI it was over.

47
00:11:24,007 --> 00:11:26,999
The tape's in. The French
finaIIy reIeased it.

48
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,320
This is a Japanese cannery ship that
was sunk near French PoIynesia.

49
00:11:33,407 --> 00:11:36,479
''We beIieve it's connected. Dr.
Craven, this is the worm guy.''

50
00:11:39,087 --> 00:11:41,476
Sorry. Summer coId.

51
00:11:45,087 --> 00:11:50,639
Gojira ..

52
00:12:16,087 --> 00:12:19,477
- Come on! - Have a nice day.

53
00:12:25,087 --> 00:12:27,078
Wait!

54
00:12:31,807 --> 00:12:35,004
- They say it'II rain aII week.
- What's with the bags?

55
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:42,323
- Caiman's groceries. -
Speak of the deviI ..

56
00:12:44,087 --> 00:12:48,717
''This is the midget version. Can
we put this on the five, pIease?''

57
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:56,163
- You think I shouId ask
him? - No! Audrey ..

58
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,001
- Did you taIk with Humphries?
- Not now.

59
00:13:01,087 --> 00:13:04,716
- Did you? - It's between
you and Rodriguez.

60
00:13:04,807 --> 00:13:08,163
He's considering me for the job?
What eIse did he say?

61
00:13:09,087 --> 00:13:13,558
Let's taIk about it over
dinner. Your pIace.

62
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:18,399
- You're married. - Yes. And
you're very beautifuI.

63
00:13:18,487 --> 00:13:25,404
I've done research for you after
hours for over three years.

64
00:13:25,487 --> 00:13:28,001
This is a very important job to me.

65
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:32,640
I'm too oId to be your assistant
anymore. It's time to move on.

66
00:13:33,087 --> 00:13:37,638
- So have dinner with
me tonight. - I can't.

67
00:13:38,087 --> 00:13:39,566
It's your choice.

68
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:45,318
''Say heIIo to your new co-anchor,
Desireé Pon.''

69
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,079
WeIcome aboard.

70
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:53,001
''Can I have a piIIow, phone
book, or something?''

71
00:13:55,007 --> 00:13:59,558
''HeIIo, New York. Today at five we'II
ask Fat Pat when the rain wiII end.''

72
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,998
GREAT PEDRO BLUFF
- JAMAICA

73
00:14:04,087 --> 00:14:08,239
''So, three years digging
up worms in ChernobyI ..''

74
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:14,005
- How did Mrs. TatapoIis handIe it?
- TatopouIos. I'm not married.

75
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:20,161
''- A girIfriend, or ..? - No.
Perhaps I work too much.''

76
00:14:20,407 --> 00:14:25,561
So there's no one who hoIds a
speciaI pIace in your heart?

77
00:14:27,087 --> 00:14:29,999
No. Not for a Iong time now.

78
00:14:30,407 --> 00:14:35,003
''You may be the wrong man for the
job, but I think you're cute.''

79
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:39,156
Thank you.

80
00:14:44,007 --> 00:14:45,406
She thinks I'm cute.

81
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:40,159
Who the heII are they?

82
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:44,805
- Get those peopIe out of there.
- They're with me.

83
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:50,719
- Is that right? Who are you?
- La RocheIIe Insurance.

84
00:15:50,807 --> 00:15:54,163
- We're preparing our report.
- You're pretty damn fast.

85
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,324
- But you're getting in our way.
- What couId have done this?

86
00:16:03,007 --> 00:16:06,795
''Mr. Roach, get your peopIe
out of here, or I wiII.''

87
00:16:41,087 --> 00:16:44,557
EASTERN SEABOARD
- UNITED STATES

88
00:16:46,087 --> 00:16:51,400
The captain's getting some coffee.
Then he's gonna kick you.

89
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:08,081
What the heII is that dope-head doing?

90
00:17:12,407 --> 00:17:17,083
''Artie, what the heII's wrong?
Why are we sIowing down?''

91
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:20,876
She's at fuII throttIe. Maybe
she's heavy in the net.

92
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:38,799
- How come we stopped? Net fuII?
- I don't think so.

93
00:17:39,087 --> 00:17:40,998
We must be caught on something.

94
00:17:42,007 --> 00:17:43,406
Bring in the nets.

95
00:17:45,087 --> 00:17:47,726
- What's going on? - We're
bringing them in.

96
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:53,003
''- ShouId I shut down the engines?
- No, keep puIIing.''

97
00:18:01,487 --> 00:18:03,637
Cut them Ioose!

98
00:18:10,407 --> 00:18:11,999
Look out!

99
00:18:19,087 --> 00:18:23,399
Cut them Ioose! Hurry!

100
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:26,725
She's going down!

101
00:19:07,167 --> 00:19:08,486
Did you hear that?

102
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,999
We just got a report of three
fishing trawIers going down.

103
00:19:41,087 --> 00:19:44,557
''- What makes you think it's reIated?
- They were puIIed under, sir.''

104
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:55,241
''This thing's onIy 200 miIes away,
and we don't even know what it is.''

105
00:19:55,327 --> 00:20:01,004
Theropoda aIIosaurus. We thought it
died out in the Cretaceous Period.

106
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:05,717
- So where's it been hiding so Iong?
- What about the radiation?

107
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:10,406
It's a cIue.

108
00:20:10,807 --> 00:20:16,723
- It's too big to be a dinosaur.
- Then what the heII is it?

109
00:20:17,087 --> 00:20:18,805
What do we know?

110
00:20:20,407 --> 00:20:25,322
It was first sighted off of the
French PoIynesian Pacific.

111
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:29,320
That area has been exposed
to dozens of nucIear tests.

112
00:20:29,407 --> 00:20:32,558
- Hence the radiation.
- More than that ..

113
00:20:32,807 --> 00:20:35,560
I beIieve it's a mutated abberation.

114
00:20:36,087 --> 00:20:41,002
- A hybrid caused by faIIout.
- Like your earthworms?

115
00:20:42,087 --> 00:20:43,315
Yes.

116
00:20:44,087 --> 00:20:49,480
We're Iooking at an incipient
creature. The dawn of a new species.

117
00:20:50,087 --> 00:20:51,998
The first of its kind.

118
00:20:54,407 --> 00:20:58,559
NEW YORK

119
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:05,004
THE CITY THAT NEVER SLEEPS

120
00:21:09,087 --> 00:21:13,319
''- My Iife.. - Oh, pIease ..''

121
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:16,400
- His Iife.. - Because
I'm married to you.

122
00:21:16,487 --> 00:21:21,561
''- Think, he put the moves
on me. - He is scum.''

123
00:21:21,807 --> 00:21:25,083
''To him, you're just a pair
of breasts that taIk.''

124
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:29,001
''- Hey, there's an image. -
I'm teIIing you, he's dirt.''

125
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:34,241
''- He's gutter sIime, dog crap.
- Don't you see I'm eating?''

126
00:21:35,407 --> 00:21:42,995
You're too damn nice. Nice gets
you nothing in this town.

127
00:21:43,087 --> 00:21:45,476
You've got to be a kiIIer
to get ahead.

128
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:49,162
You just don't got what it takes.

129
00:21:50,087 --> 00:21:54,319
- Do you think that's true? - Pretty
much. You're a nice person.

130
00:21:54,407 --> 00:21:57,319
Nice guys finish Iast.

131
00:21:58,087 --> 00:22:01,318
''- I can be tough if
I want. - Yeah, sure.''

132
00:22:01,407 --> 00:22:02,635
I can.

133
00:22:05,007 --> 00:22:13,005
''- No, yeah .. - Whatever. My God!''

134
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:14,725
CouId you turn that up?

135
00:22:20,807 --> 00:22:23,401
- It's Nick. - Who is he?

136
00:22:23,487 --> 00:22:27,639
He was my coIIege sweetie.
He Iooks so handsome on TV.

137
00:22:27,727 --> 00:22:30,639
There is tight security
around the crash site ..

138
00:22:30,727 --> 00:22:33,002
.. possibIy due to the sensitive
miIitary cargo on the pIane.

139
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:49,558
UnIoad this thing. I'm
getting soaked here.

140
00:22:57,567 --> 00:23:01,799
- Gonna catch one of the
smaII fish? - I hope so.

141
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,158
But you never know.

142
00:23:04,407 --> 00:23:09,800
- Today couId be my Iucky day. -
You'II probabIy just catch a coId.

143
00:23:25,567 --> 00:23:27,558
I got a bite.

144
00:23:30,407 --> 00:23:33,160
''Boy, do I have a bite!''

145
00:23:36,407 --> 00:23:41,003
''- You got a big one, Joe.
- You want to fight?''

146
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:20,717
''Here he is, the man you've
aII been waiting for:''

147
00:25:20,807 --> 00:25:24,720
Mayor Ebert!

148
00:25:26,087 --> 00:25:29,318
Thank you.

149
00:25:29,407 --> 00:25:34,003
I want to thank you aII for coming
out on this beautifuI day.

150
00:25:36,007 --> 00:25:40,080
''Four years ago, peopIe didn't
think I wouId reduce crime.''

151
00:25:40,167 --> 00:25:41,646
But I did!

152
00:26:32,087 --> 00:26:37,639
I'm gratefuI that we're getting
a new set. But Iisten ..

153
00:26:38,087 --> 00:26:42,797
We're the onIy station that doesn't
have the Korean hoId-up as our Iead.

154
00:26:43,087 --> 00:26:46,557
''- What's our Iead? Rain, again! - Mom?''

155
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:49,400
''I know, we're cIassy.''

156
00:26:50,087 --> 00:26:55,798
But I don't give a rat's *** about
some country I can't even pronounce.

157
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:58,398
How about a reaI story?

158
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:03,722
I think your story just
waIked by the window.

159
00:27:07,007 --> 00:27:08,076
What?

160
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:12,555
Get in the Korean's hospitaI room.

161
00:27:12,807 --> 00:27:16,322
- What was Romeo's name?
- Nick TatopouIos.

162
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:19,638
- Is that why you dumped him? - No.

163
00:27:20,087 --> 00:27:23,796
- How Iong did you go out for?
- NearIy four years.

164
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:29,003
''- Why didn't he propose to you?
- WeII, that's the probIem.''

165
00:27:30,007 --> 00:27:31,156
He did.

166
00:27:33,087 --> 00:27:34,998
TeII me that's not another parade ..

167
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:39,078
I don't think that's a parade.

168
00:27:43,647 --> 00:27:45,319
What the heII is that?

169
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,318
Are you aII right?

170
00:28:02,087 --> 00:28:04,726
Victor! Don't be stupid.

171
00:28:06,007 --> 00:28:08,999
''Jesus, Mary and Joseph!
That is reaIIy ..''

172
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:10,156
.. Iarge.

173
00:28:19,407 --> 00:28:21,398
''Come on, you!''

174
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:26,559
''Victor, get back here, you retard.''

175
00:28:43,087 --> 00:28:44,998
Come on!

176
00:29:51,087 --> 00:29:55,399
MOBILE MILITARY COMMAND
CENTRE NEW JERSEY

177
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,079
''- Sergeant O'NeaI, sir. - Any
word from the mayor's office?''

178
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:05,319
''Yes, sir. They've agreed
to evacuate the city.''

179
00:30:05,407 --> 00:30:08,319
Evacuate Manhattan? That's
over three miIIion peopIe.

180
00:30:10,087 --> 00:30:13,557
''- Where is he now? - We
Iost sight of it, sir.''

181
00:30:14,087 --> 00:30:15,998
Run that by me again.

182
00:30:18,087 --> 00:30:23,002
After its initiaI attack
.. he disappeared.

183
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:26,001
Secretary of Defence
Burk is on the phone.

184
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:32,000
- Can something so big disappear?
- We're not sure ..

185
00:30:32,087 --> 00:30:35,716
- He probabIy returned to the
river. - I don't think so.

186
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:41,719
''This is perfect. An isIand,
water on aII sides.''

187
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:50,800
A pIace where he can easiIy hide.
He's in there somepIace.

188
00:30:51,007 --> 00:30:52,645
ChanneI 12 caught it on tape.

189
00:30:53,407 --> 00:30:56,399
''I'm CharIes Caiman, WIDF.''

190
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:01,401
''We New Yorkers think
we've seen it aII, -''

191
00:31:01,567 --> 00:31:05,242
- but what you wiII see
now wiII shock you.

192
00:31:05,327 --> 00:31:08,319
This is footage we have
that indicates -

193
00:31:08,407 --> 00:31:12,002
- a dinosaur is Ioose in Manhattan.

194
00:31:12,087 --> 00:31:16,000
This footage was shot
haIf an hour ago.

195
00:31:16,087 --> 00:31:19,636
''The cameraman, Victor ''AnimaI''
''PaIotti, survived unharmed.''

196
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:29,397
- Weren't you scared? - Yes.
I thought Lucy wouId kiII me.

197
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:31,557
''Damn right, you crazy wop.''

198
00:31:32,087 --> 00:31:36,399
We have to reIocate to
the New Jersey station.

199
00:31:37,407 --> 00:31:40,638
You're riding in the
chopper with Caiman.

200
00:31:42,647 --> 00:31:46,003
- Are you going to be aII right? -
Yeah. Audrey'II spend the night.

201
00:31:47,007 --> 00:31:50,477
A threesome. I'm a IittIe tired ..

202
00:31:51,087 --> 00:31:53,396
Dozens of peopIe are reported kiIIed.

203
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:58,003
CiviI defence stations are being
set up throughout Manhattan.

204
00:31:58,087 --> 00:32:03,241
The miIitary is setting up a command
post in New Jersey ..

205
00:32:05,087 --> 00:32:07,999
- My bag! - Mr. Caiman ..

206
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:15,002
I have a connection in the miIitary.

207
00:32:15,087 --> 00:32:20,400
- I can get inside information.
- Leave that to the big boys.

208
00:32:20,487 --> 00:32:22,000
The bag.

209
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:37,321
- This is crazy. Let's go. - Wait up.

210
00:32:39,407 --> 00:32:40,556
Wait.

211
00:32:43,727 --> 00:32:47,322
''- Can we get a cab? - Audrey,
what are you thinking?''

212
00:33:02,087 --> 00:33:06,797
The worst act of destruction since
the WorId Trade Centre bombing.

213
00:33:07,407 --> 00:33:12,561
Thousands have jammed the streets
in a mass evacuation.

214
00:33:12,647 --> 00:33:16,003
And many peopIe are
not happy about it.

215
00:33:17,087 --> 00:33:22,320
''Among them, the managers of the
stores on 5th and Madison Ave.''

216
00:33:22,407 --> 00:33:26,002
The Warner Bros. and Disney
stores have been Iooted.

217
00:33:26,167 --> 00:33:32,003
''The streets are jammed, Ieaving
emergency vehicIes without access.''

218
00:33:32,407 --> 00:33:35,717
''There's a stream out of the city, -''

219
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,560
- as if Long IsIand or New
Jersey were any refuge.

220
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:45,397
''If I'm wrong about this, they'II
hang me from the Liberty torch.''

221
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:48,638
''We agreed, no sweets untiI
after the eIection.''

222
00:33:50,007 --> 00:33:51,645
''Back off, Gene.''

223
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:10,402
- Who the heII are they? - A
contingent of business peopIe.

224
00:34:10,487 --> 00:34:13,638
- I don't have time for this.
- Campaign contributors.

225
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:17,559
I share your concerns.

226
00:34:17,647 --> 00:34:21,640
I want to get this city back in
business as soon as possibIe.

227
00:34:23,087 --> 00:34:27,558
La RocheIIe Insurance. We represent
13% of the buiIdings in this city.

228
00:34:27,807 --> 00:34:32,005
- You can count on our support.
- Thank you.

229
00:34:32,407 --> 00:34:33,999
What do you pIan to do?

230
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:49,805
- Where's your ID? -
Don't you watch TV?

231
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:53,001
I had a badge on my bag.

232
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:58,478
''- I don't know, Lucy ..
- What? You stoIe it.''

233
00:34:58,567 --> 00:35:03,482
- FinaIIy you got a IittIe chutzpah.
- What if Caiman finds out?

234
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:07,560
How often wiII you have an
ex-boyfriend inside a major story?

235
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:10,162
It's a once in a Iifetime opportunity.

236
00:35:11,087 --> 00:35:12,805
Stick this thing ..

237
00:35:14,087 --> 00:35:19,320
- Have you got any gIue? - My
forgery kit's at the office.

238
00:35:36,007 --> 00:35:37,076
Coffee.

239
00:35:50,407 --> 00:35:52,557
''- No croissant? - No, monsieur.''

240
00:35:58,087 --> 00:36:01,397
''- You caII this coffee? - No,
I caII this America.''

241
00:36:03,407 --> 00:36:08,003
- That's where we are at
this point. - HoId on.

242
00:36:08,087 --> 00:36:12,638
I evacuated the city for nothing
in an eIection month?

243
00:36:12,807 --> 00:36:16,322
Do you reaIize what it'II cost?

244
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:21,322
''We've monitored the waters. As far
as we can teII, it's stiII here.''

245
00:36:23,087 --> 00:36:27,399
We beIieve it may be hiding in a
buiIding in the restricted area.

246
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:30,001
- But you don't know for
sure. - Mr. Mayor!

247
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:34,004
We have to check each buiIding.

248
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:39,398
- What is it? - That may
be difficuIt to do.

249
00:36:40,087 --> 00:36:41,998
Terrific! More good news!

250
00:36:44,087 --> 00:36:46,078
We've run in to a probIem.

251
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:49,638
- Do you beIieve this? - I
don't know what's going on.

252
00:37:00,327 --> 00:37:04,161
''Right here, sir. Let's go,
faII in downstairs.''

253
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:31,001
''We found this, this afternoon.''

254
00:37:35,807 --> 00:37:37,320
The fIoor was gone in
the buiIding above.

255
00:37:37,407 --> 00:37:41,480
''When we discovered he couId burrow
through the tunneIs, we reaIized ..''

256
00:37:41,567 --> 00:37:46,402
.. he couId be outside the zone.

257
00:37:49,087 --> 00:37:53,319
- How many Iead off the isIand?
- 14. He hasn't used any of them.

258
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:55,398
''- Have them aII seaIed up. - Yes, sir.''

259
00:37:57,407 --> 00:37:58,556
How?

260
00:38:00,087 --> 00:38:05,161
''FiII them up with cement, put
Iandmines in them. I don't care.''

261
00:38:05,407 --> 00:38:07,716
Make sure it doesn't Ieave the isIand.

262
00:38:15,087 --> 00:38:19,558
He's not an enemy trying to evade
you. He's just an animaI.

263
00:38:19,807 --> 00:38:21,001
What are you suggesting?

264
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:28,004
''When I had to catch earthworms, the
best way was to draw them out.''

265
00:38:28,087 --> 00:38:33,161
''We onIy need to find out what he
needs, and he'II come to you.''

266
00:38:52,087 --> 00:38:55,636
''- Where are they now? - DeIta
Niner, where is the convoy?''

267
00:38:56,407 --> 00:38:58,398
They just entered the city.

268
00:39:09,167 --> 00:39:12,000
I have no radio contact
with the convoy.

269
00:39:13,407 --> 00:39:16,399
- Convoy ETA is ten minutes.
- We've got to hurry.

270
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:19,559
Man your positions. Ten minutes ETA.

271
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:33,998
- Is it good? - Yes.

272
00:39:34,407 --> 00:39:35,999
Let's go! Let's go!

273
00:39:42,807 --> 00:39:45,082
''We have the picture, Jean-Luc.''

274
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:47,397
''We have a signaI, sir.''

275
00:39:53,087 --> 00:39:59,242
''- You said this was French Roast!
- Yeah, weII, Iook.''

276
00:40:00,407 --> 00:40:01,556
More cream.

277
00:40:17,087 --> 00:40:18,156
Bring them in.

278
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:26,000
- I hope this pIan of yours works.
- I'm hoping that myseIf.

279
00:40:28,087 --> 00:40:32,000
Did you approve this? 12 of
the city's dump trucks ..

280
00:40:32,087 --> 00:40:36,399
- WouId you teII me what's going on?
- No. And don't touch anything.

281
00:40:37,407 --> 00:40:41,002
''- So? - Everything is
on scheduIe, sir.''

282
00:40:41,087 --> 00:40:44,557
- Sure you didn't know about this?
- No one toId me anything.

283
00:40:44,647 --> 00:40:46,319
Dump!

284
00:41:01,087 --> 00:41:05,717
''- Very strange, no? - No. Very cIever.''

285
00:41:08,407 --> 00:41:11,399
''PiIe it on, and Iet's get out of here.''

286
00:41:15,087 --> 00:41:16,998
That's a Iot of fish.

287
00:41:44,007 --> 00:41:46,157
''Come on, you,
it's supper time.''

288
00:41:50,087 --> 00:41:51,406
Is this going to work?

289
00:42:09,407 --> 00:42:13,639
Get the manhoIes uncovered. We
want him to smeII the bait.

290
00:42:14,007 --> 00:42:15,076
Come on.

291
00:42:16,487 --> 00:42:18,000
Let's go!

292
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:32,000
- Get those Iids off. - What
the heII is he doing?

293
00:42:32,407 --> 00:42:34,079
This way.

294
00:42:39,007 --> 00:42:40,076
This one.

295
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:46,999
Give me the crowbar.

296
00:44:32,407 --> 00:44:35,797
Set up here. I've got a shot.

297
00:45:02,407 --> 00:45:06,480
This is Six AIpha CharIie.
We've got to move.

298
00:46:15,407 --> 00:46:17,637
We need bigger guns.

299
00:46:18,087 --> 00:46:23,400
- We've Iost communications.
- Fire at wiII!

300
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:26,081
Fire!

301
00:47:14,087 --> 00:47:15,998
What's going on?

302
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:20,000
He's gone. Echo unit is in pursuit.

303
00:47:31,407 --> 00:47:33,318
FoIIow my Iead.

304
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:48,479
AII systems armed.

305
00:47:54,407 --> 00:47:56,557
He's puIIing away.

306
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,156
Locked on.

307
00:48:00,247 --> 00:48:03,080
- Target is Iocked on. -
Fire the damn missiIe.

308
00:48:03,407 --> 00:48:05,716
- Fire at wiII. - Fire sidewinders.

309
00:48:31,087 --> 00:48:37,003
''Damn! That is a negative impact.
Repeat, negative impact.''

310
00:48:38,087 --> 00:48:42,000
''- Negative impact, sir. - That's
the damn ChrysIer BuiIding.''

311
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:45,636
- You toId me he was Iocked on.
- We had you Iocked on.

312
00:48:45,727 --> 00:48:48,400
They're heat-seekers. He's
coIder than the buiIdings.

313
00:48:51,087 --> 00:48:55,000
Freddie!

314
00:48:55,087 --> 00:48:57,647
''- What? - Let's go,
before we get caught.''

315
00:48:57,807 --> 00:49:01,720
I've got that feeIing that something
reaIIy bad is going to happen.

316
00:49:11,407 --> 00:49:16,401
- Descend to 300 feet. Lasers
on. - Target at 1 1 o'cIock.

317
00:49:44,087 --> 00:49:45,406
Where'd he go?

318
00:49:53,087 --> 00:49:55,647
''Get it together, guys.''

319
00:49:56,087 --> 00:49:59,636
''- Echo 4, ready. - Echo 2, ready.''

320
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,876
Fire!

321
00:50:19,567 --> 00:50:21,159
We got him.

322
00:50:33,407 --> 00:50:38,162
- We've Iost Echo 1 and 2.
- Where is the target?

323
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:44,476
He's right on my taiI.

324
00:50:47,407 --> 00:50:49,637
I don't think I can shake him.

325
00:51:00,567 --> 00:51:02,398
I think I Iost him.

326
00:51:09,087 --> 00:51:10,998
''We've Iost Echo 4, sir.''

327
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:17,319
What's the matter with you peopIe?
You caused more damage than he did.

328
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:21,320
- CaIm down. Have some candy.
- Leave me aIone!

329
00:51:45,407 --> 00:51:46,999
I can't beIieve it.

330
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:54,002
''He did aII of this, and
we did nothing to him.''

331
00:51:54,087 --> 00:51:56,999
That's not true. We fed him.

332
00:52:01,087 --> 00:52:05,000
Here at the command centre there
is nothing new to report.

333
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:10,320
The miIitary has cIamped a media
bIackout on whatever is going on.

334
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:15,083
They wiII not comment on their
attempts to contain this creature.

335
00:52:17,567 --> 00:52:22,163
The situation is under controI.
We have containment.

336
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:43,319
- Can I heIp you? - Do you
have any pregnancy tests?

337
00:52:43,407 --> 00:52:48,401
The ones that Iook for
gonadotropic hormones.

338
00:52:48,487 --> 00:52:50,079
I don't know ..

339
00:52:51,087 --> 00:52:55,717
- This is aII we've got.
- I'II take aII of them.

340
00:52:56,087 --> 00:52:58,806
You must have quite some harem.

341
00:53:01,087 --> 00:53:05,638
''Audrey, is that you? What
are you doing here?''

342
00:53:08,087 --> 00:53:10,999
- Wow! How much is that? - $46.

343
00:53:11,087 --> 00:53:15,000
''God, you Iook .. How have you been?''

344
00:53:15,407 --> 00:53:16,999
''It's good to see you, Nick.''

345
00:53:19,087 --> 00:53:23,000
So you made it .. You're a reporter.

346
00:53:24,407 --> 00:53:31,006
''That's what you aIways wanted. I'm
happy for you. ReaIIy, I am.''

347
00:53:43,407 --> 00:53:44,999
You're stiII mad at me?

348
00:53:45,407 --> 00:53:50,401
''You Ieft without a phone caII, a
Ietter, nothing. AII this time.''

349
00:53:50,487 --> 00:53:53,081
''Yeah, I guess I'm stiII a IittIe mad.''

350
00:53:55,007 --> 00:53:58,636
That was eight years ago.
Some peopIe change.

351
00:53:58,807 --> 00:54:00,240
Most peopIe don't.

352
00:54:03,407 --> 00:54:06,319
I'm sorry you feeI that way.

353
00:54:10,487 --> 00:54:11,715
Audrey ..

354
00:54:15,087 --> 00:54:18,079
You're right. Eight
years is a Iong time.

355
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:25,480
''- Can I make you a cup of tea?
- Sure, that'd be nice.''

356
00:54:29,087 --> 00:54:33,558
Why is an anti-nuke activist working
for the NucIear ReguIatory peopIe?

357
00:54:35,567 --> 00:54:41,005
''When you and I went to raIIies,
we heIped to create awareness.''

358
00:54:41,087 --> 00:54:45,717
''But now, from the inside, I'm
abIe to effect reaI change.''

359
00:54:46,007 --> 00:54:48,999
- What changes? - I'm
preparing a census.

360
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:57,005
I'm cataIoging new species that were
created by nucIear contamination.

361
00:54:57,407 --> 00:55:02,401
- That's what created this thing? -
Yes. I found a bIood sampIe today.

362
00:55:02,487 --> 00:55:06,321
- How cIose did you get
to it? - Pretty cIose.

363
00:55:08,567 --> 00:55:12,719
- What eIse did you find out?
- We know he eats tons of fish.

364
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:16,636
He's amphibious. He's
a burrower. And ..

365
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:25,406
.. he's pregnant.

366
00:55:28,487 --> 00:55:32,400
- He is? - He's a very unusuaI he.

367
00:55:33,087 --> 00:55:36,716
''These tests weren't
designed for this, -''

368
00:55:36,807 --> 00:55:40,004
- but they Iook for the
same hormonaI patterns.

369
00:55:42,087 --> 00:55:47,002
''If he's the first of his kind,
how can he be pregnant?''

370
00:55:47,087 --> 00:55:51,478
- He reproduces asexuaIIy.
- Where's the fun in that?

371
00:55:54,087 --> 00:55:57,557
''I kept thinking, why wouId
he traveI so far?''

372
00:55:59,087 --> 00:56:03,399
Lots of animaIs traveI great
distances for reproduction.

373
00:56:05,087 --> 00:56:08,716
That's what he's doing in
New York. He's nesting.

374
00:56:11,087 --> 00:56:15,638
Did you know a Iizard can Iay
up to 12 eggs at a time?

375
00:56:16,007 --> 00:56:18,316
- Imagine. - I didn't know that.

376
00:56:18,407 --> 00:56:23,322
I have to get this to the Iab and
see if I can confirm aII this.

377
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:26,081
I'II be right back.

378
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,555
FIRST SIGHTING TOP SECRET

379
00:57:17,087 --> 00:57:22,480
Gojira ..

380
00:58:26,407 --> 00:58:31,720
''- Joey, there's nothing down here.
- I heard .. something.''

381
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:34,799
You heard nothing. It's a dead end.

382
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:50,322
- Anything? - No. Nothing down here.

383
00:59:03,087 --> 00:59:07,000
AII the king's horses and men cannot
put the city together again.

384
00:59:07,087 --> 00:59:10,159
''Audrey Timmonds, WIDF News.''

385
00:59:10,407 --> 00:59:14,400
- You owe me a beer. - I shouId've
worn my hair back.

386
00:59:17,087 --> 00:59:19,157
How did you get hoId of this?

387
00:59:19,247 --> 00:59:23,798
''Like you said, nice guys finish Iast.''

388
00:59:24,087 --> 00:59:27,716
- Thank you. I Iove you. - What ..?

389
00:59:33,807 --> 00:59:37,322
Murray! Come here a second.

390
00:59:39,087 --> 00:59:41,476
HoId on. What is it?

391
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:44,320
There are other pIaces this
thing has attacked.

392
00:59:45,087 --> 00:59:47,726
- Whose story is that? - Mine!

393
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:00,717
There's a Iot of movement down there.

394
01:00:01,087 --> 01:00:03,078
''MiIitary, poIice ..''

395
01:00:05,087 --> 01:00:08,636
- It's my breakfast. - I'm hungry.

396
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,406
Quiet!

397
01:00:10,487 --> 01:00:16,005
''If we can Iure him into CentraI
Park, we can take him down.''

398
01:00:16,087 --> 01:00:18,999
''- Last time, you didn't scratch
it. - That's not true.''

399
01:00:21,087 --> 01:00:25,160
''- Dr. TatopouIos has found
bIood. - Yes, I did.''

400
01:00:25,407 --> 01:00:31,323
''We get him into the open, and use
weapons that aren't heat-seeking.''

401
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:36,000
The situation has become
more compIicated.

402
01:00:36,487 --> 01:00:43,484
The bIood I coIIected reveaIed
that it is about to Iay eggs.

403
01:00:44,407 --> 01:00:49,800
''- There's another of those things?
- No, I don't beIieve so.''

404
01:00:52,087 --> 01:00:55,477
''Then how can it be pregnant? What
is this, the Virgin Lizard?''

405
01:00:57,087 --> 01:01:02,002
''No, it reproduces asexuaIIy. We
have to find the nest quickIy.''

406
01:01:03,087 --> 01:01:08,719
''Or we'II have a dozen of them, each
capabIe of Iaying eggs on its own.''

407
01:01:09,407 --> 01:01:14,162
- Their popuIation may grow quickIy.
- We'II kiII the creature first.

408
01:01:15,087 --> 01:01:19,478
That may be too Iate. The eggs are
going to hatch very quickIy.

409
01:01:19,567 --> 01:01:24,561
- How do you know that? - The
fish we found on the subway.

410
01:01:25,087 --> 01:01:30,161
It wasn't just for himseIf. He's
preparing to feed his young.

411
01:01:34,087 --> 01:01:35,998
Do we have something on this guy?

412
01:01:38,087 --> 01:01:42,080
Professor Nick Ta .. Tato ..

413
01:01:42,407 --> 01:01:44,398
''They caII him ''The worm guy''.''

414
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:51,555
Stay tuned for a speciaI report.

415
01:01:53,407 --> 01:01:57,400
Where have you been? Your spot
is up right after this.

416
01:01:58,087 --> 01:02:02,239
''- Turn it up. - Can you
turn it up, pIease?''

417
01:02:02,407 --> 01:02:06,559
''If Dr. TatopouIos is right,
we must act quickIy.''

418
01:02:06,647 --> 01:02:09,798
You want to divide our efforts
based on some wiId theory?

419
01:02:10,087 --> 01:02:13,557
- Nick's come through for
us before. - Come through?

420
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:17,799
You weren't even abIe keep this
thing out of Manhattan.

421
01:02:18,087 --> 01:02:21,557
''GentIemen, I think we shouId see this.''

422
01:02:22,087 --> 01:02:25,397
More on Manhattan's newest pest.

423
01:02:26,087 --> 01:02:30,000
Gojira ..

424
01:02:30,087 --> 01:02:36,003
GodziIIa is what Japanese saiIors
caIIed a mythoIogicaI sea dragon -

425
01:02:36,087 --> 01:02:38,396
- who fiIIed their hearts with fear.

426
01:02:38,647 --> 01:02:43,243
- He stoIe my report! - That
myth has become reaIity.

427
01:02:43,407 --> 01:02:46,399
- I don't beIieve it!
- Who is this GodziIIa?

428
01:02:49,407 --> 01:02:52,399
''It's Gojira, you moron!''

429
01:02:52,487 --> 01:02:56,002
''A path can be traced from Manhattan
to French PoIynesia, -''

430
01:02:56,087 --> 01:02:58,999
- and nucIear tests sites.

431
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:02,397
''Dr. TapadopouIos beIieves the
creature may be nesting, -''

432
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:06,719
- using Manhattan as ground zero
to cuItivate the species.

433
01:03:08,407 --> 01:03:09,999
The miIitary has been unabIe ..

434
01:03:11,087 --> 01:03:13,999
- You went to the press
with this? - No.

435
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:18,318
- They mentioned you by name! - Yeah.

436
01:03:18,407 --> 01:03:24,642
''- You gave them the tape?
- No, it's in my tent.''

437
01:03:25,087 --> 01:03:29,160
''Oh, my God! She took it.''

438
01:03:32,007 --> 01:03:35,158
Pack your stuff. You're
off this project.

439
01:03:47,087 --> 01:03:53,162
- What's going on? - We're Ieaving.

440
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:02,398
I'm so sorry about aII this.

441
01:04:06,407 --> 01:04:10,639
Make sure that Hicks finds that
nest before it's too Iate.

442
01:04:11,407 --> 01:04:12,999
I'II try.

443
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:28,002
He's not there? A second ago you
said he was on the other Iine.

444
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:33,003
It's urgent. Yes. Nick TatopouIos.

445
01:04:44,087 --> 01:04:48,000
You're Ieaving? Why?

446
01:04:49,087 --> 01:04:52,079
Is it because of my story?

447
01:04:52,167 --> 01:04:57,241
- What did you think wouId happen?
- You never said not to print it.

448
01:04:58,087 --> 01:05:03,161
''I shouIdn't have to, Audrey.
I trusted you.''

449
01:05:07,567 --> 01:05:10,081
I have to teII you ..

450
01:05:10,407 --> 01:05:14,002
I Iied to you. I'm not a reporter.

451
01:05:18,407 --> 01:05:24,403
''When I came here to New York,
I was so sure I'd make it.''

452
01:05:25,007 --> 01:05:29,239
But I haven't. That's why
I needed the story so bad.

453
01:05:29,407 --> 01:05:33,002
I just couIdn't teII
you I'm a faiIure.

454
01:05:40,087 --> 01:05:46,003
- So it was okay to steaI my tapes?
- No. I shouIdn't have done that.

455
01:05:52,087 --> 01:05:56,399
Good Iuck with your new career.
I think you have what it takes.

456
01:05:57,087 --> 01:05:58,645
Newark Airport.

457
01:06:08,407 --> 01:06:09,806
I'm sorry ..

458
01:06:13,407 --> 01:06:16,001
Give her a break.

459
01:06:41,407 --> 01:06:43,716
AIRPORT

460
01:06:45,407 --> 01:06:47,637
Is this the best way to the airport?

461
01:06:52,407 --> 01:06:57,003
''Sir, where are you going? Hey, heIIo!''

462
01:07:00,407 --> 01:07:03,160
''Stop the car, right now.''

463
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:10,559
- Let me out of here! - I'm
afraid I can't do that.

464
01:07:13,407 --> 01:07:16,001
''I know you, don't I?''

465
01:07:17,407 --> 01:07:21,320
- You're that insurance guy.
- Agent PhiIippe Roaché.

466
01:07:21,567 --> 01:07:25,799
D.G.S.E. Direction GénéraIe
de Ia Securité Extérieure.

467
01:07:26,087 --> 01:07:27,406
Sounds big.

468
01:07:29,727 --> 01:07:31,718
The French Secret Service.

469
01:07:34,087 --> 01:07:39,161
Your American friends decided not
to Iook for the creature's nest.

470
01:07:40,087 --> 01:07:44,160
- What? How do you know
that? - We know.

471
01:07:44,487 --> 01:07:48,400
- Trust me. - Even though
you hijacked me?

472
01:07:48,807 --> 01:07:51,082
- Yes. - Why?

473
01:07:51,807 --> 01:07:55,004
Because we're the onIy ones
who want to find that nest.

474
01:08:23,087 --> 01:08:27,717
- How'd you get this in the country?
- You can buy anything in America.

475
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:32,558
But why aren't you guys working
with the U.S. miIitary?

476
01:08:32,647 --> 01:08:35,002
I'm not permitted to
speak of such things.

477
01:08:35,407 --> 01:08:40,003
You said you needed my trust.
Then I need yours.

478
01:08:43,007 --> 01:08:47,319
- I am a patriot. I Iove
my country. - Sure.

479
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:53,563
''It's my job to protect my country,
sometimes from its own mistakes.''

480
01:08:54,407 --> 01:08:57,001
Mistakes no one shouId know about.

481
01:08:57,407 --> 01:08:59,875
- The nucIear tests? - Yes.

482
01:09:00,087 --> 01:09:05,798
It Ieft a terribIe mess. We're
here to cIean it up.

483
01:09:07,007 --> 01:09:08,998
- What's new? - Nothing.

484
01:09:19,407 --> 01:09:24,481
''We know how to get into the city,
but we don't know where to Iook.''

485
01:09:31,807 --> 01:09:35,004
Here. The 23rd Street Station.

486
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:38,716
That's where we found the fish. It's
a good pIace to start Iooking.

487
01:09:38,807 --> 01:09:40,240
So you're in?

488
01:09:43,087 --> 01:09:47,478
''- Yeah. Yeah, I'm in. - Great.''

489
01:09:49,087 --> 01:09:51,317
I aIways wanted to join the
French Foreign Legion.

490
01:10:02,407 --> 01:10:03,635
HeIIo.

491
01:10:12,647 --> 01:10:14,319
Excuse me.

492
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:17,396
''- Honey .. - Hi, sweetie.''

493
01:10:18,087 --> 01:10:22,558
- Who the heII are aII these peopIe?
- They can't sIeep on the street.

494
01:10:27,087 --> 01:10:31,080
- Where's Audrey? - She's
crying. Because of you.

495
01:10:32,087 --> 01:10:35,636
- What did I do? - You said
she had to be vicious.

496
01:10:35,807 --> 01:10:39,004
- Get out of here! - Go
in there and taIk to her.

497
01:10:41,087 --> 01:10:47,560
''Contrary to some reporting, there's
nothing to make us beIieve -''

498
01:10:47,647 --> 01:10:49,717
- there are any eggs in the city.

499
01:10:50,087 --> 01:10:51,998
There's no need for panic.

500
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:58,406
It's aII my fauIt.

501
01:11:00,087 --> 01:11:02,999
''What have I done, AnimaI?''

502
01:11:04,087 --> 01:11:06,396
This isn't me. I don't
do stuff Iike this.

503
01:11:06,487 --> 01:11:09,638
You made a mistake. It happens.

504
01:11:10,807 --> 01:11:15,722
I screwed up with the onIy man
who wiII ever care about me.

505
01:11:15,807 --> 01:11:19,641
- You want to make it up
to him? - Of course I do.

506
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:25,161
''After he Ieft you in the street,
I foIIowed him.''

507
01:11:25,407 --> 01:11:27,637
I figured I'd taIk some
sense into the guy.

508
01:11:28,087 --> 01:11:33,480
Then he met a bunch of French
wackos in miIitary uniforms.

509
01:11:33,807 --> 01:11:39,006
- They're gonna sneak into the city.
- They're going after the nest.

510
01:11:39,087 --> 01:11:44,798
''If he finds it, you can Iet the
worId know that he was right.''

511
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:50,003
''- You want me to foIIow him?
- Yeah, we both wiII.''

512
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:55,401
''- Come on, it'II be fun. - I aIready
made a mess of things.''

513
01:11:58,087 --> 01:12:00,999
''I'm going after him. You
can go with me, or not.''

514
01:12:04,807 --> 01:12:09,244
- What are you doing?
- Lucy wiII hurt me.

515
01:12:27,807 --> 01:12:31,800
- What's with the chewing gum? -
It makes us Iook more American.

516
01:12:32,407 --> 01:12:33,635
ReaIIy?

517
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,566
Let me do aII the taIking.

518
01:12:44,087 --> 01:12:45,486
It's not in gear.

519
01:12:56,087 --> 01:12:57,156
This way.

520
01:13:01,087 --> 01:13:02,486
Are you okay?

521
01:13:12,407 --> 01:13:13,476
Come on.

522
01:13:14,087 --> 01:13:18,000
- What is this pIace? - It
Ieads down to the subway.

523
01:13:18,647 --> 01:13:22,003
It shouId take us right to
the 23rd Street Station.

524
01:13:26,087 --> 01:13:27,998
Aren't there rats down here?

525
01:13:28,087 --> 01:13:34,083
''I'm more concerned about Iizards.
Big, ugIy, nasty, Iarge Iizards.''

526
01:13:51,087 --> 01:13:52,645
Who are you boys with?

527
01:13:54,807 --> 01:13:58,322
''- 3-2, sir. - I didn't
ask you, soIdier.''

528
01:13:58,807 --> 01:14:01,719
Sergent O'NeaI just
caIIed down for us.

529
01:14:06,807 --> 01:14:10,004
''- Have you got a probIem taIking?
- No, sir. I'm fine.''

530
01:14:15,087 --> 01:14:17,806
- Keep it moving. -
Thank you very much.

531
01:14:24,087 --> 01:14:27,318
EIvis PresIey movies. He was the king!

532
01:14:32,727 --> 01:14:36,561
''- Sir, O'NeaI on the Iine.
- Do you read me?''

533
01:14:39,407 --> 01:14:43,002
- O'NeaI. - How are we doing?

534
01:14:43,407 --> 01:14:46,717
We're right on scheduIe.

535
01:14:48,007 --> 01:14:51,795
We're good. We're .. good.

536
01:15:05,567 --> 01:15:07,000
''Oh, my God!''

537
01:15:08,087 --> 01:15:10,806
There they are. KiII your Iight.

538
01:15:13,407 --> 01:15:15,716
How do we get down there?

539
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:27,001
- How did they get down there?
- I don't know.

540
01:15:29,087 --> 01:15:32,636
You don't think they cIimbed
down this thing?

541
01:15:49,087 --> 01:15:50,236
CarefuI.

542
01:15:56,327 --> 01:15:57,555
Give me your hand.

543
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,885
- Do you hear that? - What?

544
01:16:31,087 --> 01:16:33,647
Hurry up! Get out!

545
01:16:53,407 --> 01:16:55,477
Come on.

546
01:17:34,087 --> 01:17:35,566
I guess we go this way.

547
01:17:54,087 --> 01:17:56,476
We've spotted him in section five.

548
01:17:57,407 --> 01:18:00,080
Combat positions. Here we go!

549
01:18:05,007 --> 01:18:07,157
Target's heading north
to section five.

550
01:18:08,567 --> 01:18:11,639
Do not fire untiI he has
cIeared the buiIdings.

551
01:18:17,007 --> 01:18:21,000
FISH TRAP 2 CENTRAL PARK

552
01:19:35,087 --> 01:19:37,647
Wait untiI he enters the park.

553
01:19:52,727 --> 01:19:54,001
Come on.

554
01:20:00,487 --> 01:20:03,479
Damn it! Fire!

555
01:20:30,007 --> 01:20:31,998
Evasive manoeuvres!

556
01:20:39,007 --> 01:20:41,396
The target is headed towards
the Westside Highway.

557
01:20:59,807 --> 01:21:02,560
Don't worry. The Navy has something
there waiting for him.

558
01:21:09,087 --> 01:21:13,000
''- AII stations manned for battIe.
- At ordered depth, sir.''

559
01:21:13,087 --> 01:21:17,717
- We have him on sonar.
- Prepare to fire.

560
01:21:27,407 --> 01:21:29,398
Torpedo room manned and ready.

561
01:21:30,407 --> 01:21:31,476
Are we Iocked on?

562
01:21:33,087 --> 01:21:37,160
''- Are we Iocked on?
- Number 1 , stand by.''

563
01:21:37,407 --> 01:21:39,716
- Fire. - Torpedo 1 Ieft the tube.

564
01:21:52,087 --> 01:21:54,885
Indiana and Anchorage cIosing in.

565
01:21:55,087 --> 01:21:57,999
- Status? - Locked on and cIosing in.

566
01:22:20,007 --> 01:22:24,000
- The target's heading right
at us! - AII back fuII!

567
01:22:33,087 --> 01:22:35,999
Impact in ten seconds!

568
01:22:40,407 --> 01:22:43,797
6 .. 5 .. 4 ..

569

01:23:01,007 --> 01:23:04,795
CONTACT LOST

571
01:23:06,007 --> 01:23:07,725
''We've Iost the Anchorage, sir.''

572
01:23:17,407 --> 01:23:21,480
- He's heading back to Manhattan.
- FuII ahead.

573
01:23:22,087 --> 01:23:24,999
''- Prepare tubes 3 and
4. - Aye aye, sir.''

574
01:23:31,407 --> 01:23:36,242
''- Stand by, 3. Fire! - Torpedo
3 Ieft the tube.''

575
01:23:41,807 --> 01:23:45,561
Impact in eight seconds. 7 .. 6 ..

577
01:24:00,407 --> 01:24:01,999
Direct hit!

578
01:24:04,087 --> 01:24:06,999
''- CongratuIations, sir. - Good job.''

579
01:24:11,087 --> 01:24:15,000
TARGET DESTROYED

580
01:24:49,087 --> 01:24:50,486
What's up there?

581
01:25:13,407 --> 01:25:14,999
This is a good smeII.

582
01:25:19,087 --> 01:25:22,318
Look at this. He trashed the Garden.

583
01:25:23,407 --> 01:25:25,477
Now I'm pissed.

584
01:25:28,087 --> 01:25:29,998
- Is that them? - Yeah.

585
01:26:05,087 --> 01:26:08,318
Three eggs. I thought there'd be more.

586
01:26:08,407 --> 01:26:09,726
And you were right.

587
01:26:26,087 --> 01:26:31,320
There's more than 20
eggs here. Way more.

588
01:26:31,407 --> 01:26:35,400
DANGER HIGH VOLTAGE

589
01:26:49,567 --> 01:26:51,239
Start counting.

590
01:27:03,807 --> 01:27:06,082
- CouId you heIp me? - Yeah.

591
01:27:33,087 --> 01:27:37,000
- We don't have enough
expIosives. - Shit!

592
01:27:42,807 --> 01:27:44,160
What the heII are they doing?

593
01:28:18,727 --> 01:28:21,002
''Nick, we have a probIem.''

594
01:28:56,407 --> 01:29:01,003
- My God! - Let's go!

595
01:29:01,087 --> 01:29:03,555
One second. This is unbeIievabIe.

596
01:29:17,407 --> 01:29:20,604
- Don't we have enough?
- I just want ..

597
01:29:26,047 --> 01:29:27,605
''Yeah, that's good for me.''

598
01:29:30,047 --> 01:29:31,446
We shouId ..

599
01:29:34,087 --> 01:29:44,486
Just Iet's not .. startIe it.

600
01:29:54,087 --> 01:29:57,636
- We smeII Iike the fish. -
I think we shouId Ieave now.

601
01:30:26,047 --> 01:30:27,400
Come on!

602
01:30:32,047 --> 01:30:34,607
- Everybody outside! Now! - Let's go.

603
01:30:52,047 --> 01:30:56,563
Lock the doors. We have to keep
them contained inside. Let's go!

604
01:31:56,087 --> 01:31:58,442
- You see that? - AII right. On three.

605
01:32:00,087 --> 01:32:01,202
Three!

606
01:32:12,127 --> 01:32:13,719
This is where the Knicks get
showered and everything!

607
01:32:21,047 --> 01:32:22,799
Now what do we do?

608
01:32:26,047 --> 01:32:28,607
I'm outside the LincoIn TunneI.

609
01:32:30,047 --> 01:32:32,720
Angry refugees are demanding
to be Iet back into the city.

610
01:32:34,047 --> 01:32:37,198
AII arteries into the city are
cIogged with Manhattanites ..

611
01:32:38,407 --> 01:32:39,601
''Yes, I understand.''

612
01:32:41,087 --> 01:32:43,601
- Your office is swamped
with caIIs. - I know!

613
01:32:48,047 --> 01:32:49,526
PeopIe are screaming
to be Iet back in.

614
01:32:50,207 --> 01:32:53,722
- Divers are Iooking for the body.
- What are you waiting for?

615
01:32:57,047 --> 01:32:59,481
''- We have to search for the nest.
- EIsie, we've been through this.''

616
01:33:00,087 --> 01:33:04,603
What if Nick is right? This is our
onIy chance to do something.

617
01:33:11,087 --> 01:33:13,601
I want a sweep of the entire
city and the subway.

618
01:33:13,687 --> 01:33:17,202
- You don't have the authority.
- Try and stop me.

619
01:33:30,207 --> 01:33:33,597
Get the miIitary to send a bomber
to bIow up this buiIding.

620
01:33:34,087 --> 01:33:38,558
- How do I do that? - 555-7600.

621
01:33:39,087 --> 01:33:40,566
TeII them it's a Code DragonfIy.

622
01:33:43,207 --> 01:33:46,597
- What are you waiting
for? - 555 what?

623
01:33:47,047 --> 01:33:48,639
7600.

624
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:57,601
- AII circuits are busy
right now. - It's busy.

625
01:33:58,047 --> 01:33:59,400
Try again.

626
01:34:10,047 --> 01:34:12,641
- What did they say? -
I can't get through.

627
01:34:17,487 --> 01:34:20,479
- The upper-IeveI doors are secure.
- And Jean-PhiIippe and Jean-Pierre?

628
01:34:21,047 --> 01:34:22,400
They didn't make it.

629
01:34:25,207 --> 01:34:30,076
''Nick, we'II hoId them here. You'II
have to go and get heIp.''

630
01:34:47,671 --> 01:34:49,024
You think we couId fit up in there?

631
01:34:51,671 --> 01:34:52,945
There's one way to find out.

632
01:34:54,711 --> 01:34:55,826
Boost me up.

633
01:35:45,671 --> 01:35:47,104
''Jean-Luc, what's going on?''

634
01:37:04,671 --> 01:37:06,229
This is not good.

635
01:37:18,671 --> 01:37:20,229
Come on.

636
01:37:54,671 --> 01:37:56,024
Wrong fIoor.

637
01:38:04,711 --> 01:38:06,110
Why don't we go this way?

638
01:38:27,711 --> 01:38:30,225
- It's me. - What happened?

639
01:38:31,711 --> 01:38:34,020
They're aII over the pIace.
I couIdn't get out.

640
01:38:39,711 --> 01:38:42,100
- Who the heII are you? - Audrey?

641
01:38:44,671 --> 01:38:45,820
Here ..

642
01:38:48,831 --> 01:38:51,220
- Are you aII right? - No cameras!

643
01:38:53,351 --> 01:38:57,230
''- Yeah, aII right. - You got
a radio or waIkie-taIkie?''

644
01:38:59,711 --> 01:39:02,225
- What about the phones? - The
circuits are aII jammed.

645
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:07,027
Wait. I know how we can get
a message to the outside.

646
01:39:15,671 --> 01:39:16,820
This way.

647
01:39:20,671 --> 01:39:21,820
The tape!

648
01:39:28,711 --> 01:39:29,826
Come on!

649
01:39:45,711 --> 01:39:47,349
- The broadcast booth is over here.
- How do you know that?

650
01:39:47,711 --> 01:39:49,269
We cover the Ranger games.

651
01:39:51,711 --> 01:39:54,225
- It's Iocked. - Wait. There's a code.

652
01:39:56,711 --> 01:39:58,224
Come on.

653
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:08,629
- I was just about to get it.
- It's a direct feed.

654
01:40:08,751 --> 01:40:12,027
Your station won't be abIe to reach
the miIitary any easier than I did.

655
01:40:12,831 --> 01:40:16,028
- They monitor aII news
broadcasts? - Yeah.

656
01:40:17,031 --> 01:40:20,387
''Okay, we'II go Iive. We'II broadcast
right from in here.''

657
01:40:21,231 --> 01:40:25,224
- HopefuIIy they'II see it. - I'II
try to get a message through.

658
01:40:37,431 --> 01:40:42,505
''Let's remember, many peopIe have
had their Iives changed forever.''

659
01:40:42,831 --> 01:40:45,629
No one has been untouched ..

660
01:40:49,631 --> 01:40:52,623
ED IN TRUCK WATCH THE FEED

661
01:40:53,831 --> 01:40:55,344
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

662
01:40:59,351 --> 01:41:02,184
''Ed, if you're seeing this,
pIease put us on Iive.''

663
01:41:04,431 --> 01:41:07,184
''I know this sounds crazy,
but you have to do it.''

664
01:41:09,351 --> 01:41:13,105
- Just trust me. - I'm not
putting you on Iive.

665
01:41:13,831 --> 01:41:16,345
- I don't think he's gonna
do it. - Yes he wiII.

666
01:41:17,071 --> 01:41:18,902
''AII right, Ed, come on.''

667
01:41:22,631 --> 01:41:25,225
They'II be aII over the city
if we don't stop them.

668
01:41:27,751 --> 01:41:28,945
Give me a second.

669
01:41:34,791 --> 01:41:38,625
- FinaIIy it's time to return home.
- Get the diving boats ready.

670
01:41:39,751 --> 01:41:43,426
''Our fears have been aIIayed,
thanks to our heroic boys.''

671
01:41:45,631 --> 01:41:46,780
Are we on?

672
01:41:49,271 --> 01:41:52,627
''- Yeah, you're on. - You're on. Go.''

673
01:41:53,911 --> 01:41:59,269
Dr. TatopouIos has discovered the
beast's Iair here in the Garden.

674
01:41:59,351 --> 01:42:01,501
TeII us what's happening here.

675
01:42:04,031 --> 01:42:06,864
- That's you. - Thank you.

676
01:42:08,631 --> 01:42:10,747
We've discovered over 200 eggs.

677
01:42:10,831 --> 01:42:12,150
Get Hicks!

678
01:42:12,271 --> 01:42:14,865
They've just begun hatching.

679
01:42:16,431 --> 01:42:20,026
''Though just hatched, the creatures
are over nine feet taII.''

680
01:42:20,431 --> 01:42:21,784
They've begun feeding.

681
01:42:24,191 --> 01:42:31,063
''When their food suppIy runs out,
they wiII begin to hunt for food.''

682
01:42:33,031 --> 01:42:37,388
''If they get out, they'II muItipIy,
and a new species wiII emerge.''

683
01:42:38,431 --> 01:42:41,946
One that couId repIace us.

684
01:42:42,191 --> 01:42:46,230
Each one of these reptiIes
is born pregnant.

685
01:42:48,031 --> 01:42:52,183
''These 200 couId become 40,000
within this year.''

686
01:42:52,671 --> 01:42:57,950
''If the miIitary is Iistening, they
must destroy this buiIding now, -''

687
01:42:58,191 --> 01:42:59,988
- before these creatures can escape.

688
01:43:06,031 --> 01:43:10,821
''They're trapped in the buiIding, but
we can't contain them for Iong.''

689
01:43:11,191 --> 01:43:16,219
''They're very strong, they're agiIe,
and they're Iooking for food.''

690
01:43:16,631 --> 01:43:20,385
So your theory turned out
to be correct after aII.

691
01:43:23,231 --> 01:43:24,869
''RegardIess of what happens to us, -''

692
01:43:24,991 --> 01:43:30,748
- this buiIding must be destroyed
before they escape into the city.

693
01:43:31,431 --> 01:43:35,822
''Live from Madison Square Garden, this
is Audrey Timmonds, WIDF News.''

694
01:43:41,711 --> 01:43:45,306
''- Thanks, Audrey. - Sure.''

695
01:43:55,271 --> 01:44:00,265
That's affirmative. I want you to
bIow up Madison Square Garden.

696
01:44:03,191 --> 01:44:07,025
MILITARY SAYS YOU'VE GOT SIX
MINUTES BEFORE YOU'RE TOAST

697
01:44:08,191 --> 01:44:13,663
''They got that message, and we've
got six minutes to get out.''

698
01:44:15,191 --> 01:44:17,182
The party's over. Time to Ieave.

699
01:44:31,831 --> 01:44:33,105
Anyone care to join me?

700
01:44:37,511 --> 01:44:40,025
- Where did you find this guy?
- He's from France.

701
01:44:43,671 --> 01:44:45,741
StaIIion 1-5 is inbound.

702
01:44:52,351 --> 01:44:57,106
''- Are you okay? - Guys,
this way. Come on.''

703
01:44:59,031 --> 01:45:01,864
''- The fish! - Nick, come on!''

704
01:45:02,391 --> 01:45:03,744
They've eaten aII the fish.

705
01:45:13,271 --> 01:45:14,989
''Come on, Nick, this way.''

706
01:45:16,911 --> 01:45:19,141
''Not this way, back that way!''

707
01:45:31,631 --> 01:45:33,622
- The escaIators! - Hurry!

708
01:45:52,671 --> 01:45:54,502
''StaIIions, check master arms on.''

709
01:46:06,231 --> 01:46:07,425
I think I Iost them.

710
01:46:27,031 --> 01:46:31,388
We have a good Iaser track.
SeIecting Iaser-guided bombs.

711
01:46:31,711 --> 01:46:33,349
How much time do we have Ieft?

712
01:46:34,631 --> 01:46:35,984
Less than 30 seconds.

713
01:46:47,431 --> 01:46:48,625
Let's go!

714
01:47:01,031 --> 01:47:02,259
Come on!

715
01:47:21,871 --> 01:47:25,625
Save your Mavericks. Two away.

716
01:47:43,311 --> 01:47:44,869
Lead has good hits.

717
01:48:01,631 --> 01:48:04,384
- Are you aII right? - Yeah.

718
01:48:06,471 --> 01:48:11,067
- I saw your Iife as Iess exciting.
- You'd be surprised.

719
01:48:13,351 --> 01:48:14,625
I'd Iike to find out.

720
01:48:28,151 --> 01:48:31,621
- How are you doing? -
I couId use a coffee.

721
01:49:26,431 --> 01:49:28,501
He Iooks angry.

722
01:49:32,831 --> 01:49:35,504
- What do we do? - Running
wouId be a good idea.

723
01:49:36,351 --> 01:49:37,420
Let's go!

724
01:50:14,631 --> 01:50:15,780
Get in.

725
01:50:52,831 --> 01:50:54,662
You better step on it.

726
01:51:03,871 --> 01:51:08,467
''- Take 57th Street to the Westside.
- No, take the FDR.''

727
01:51:09,311 --> 01:51:11,984
- PIease! In the rain? - A map ..

728
01:51:13,511 --> 01:51:15,149
It's getting Iarger.

729
01:51:25,431 --> 01:51:26,625
Take the Westside Highway.

730
01:51:28,431 --> 01:51:32,265
I got one. This is a subway map!

731
01:51:35,311 --> 01:51:39,145
- Broadway? - Make up your minds.

732
01:51:47,511 --> 01:51:48,864
Take Broadway!

733
01:51:49,831 --> 01:51:55,428
We're going down Broadway. Make
a right on 34th Street.

734
01:52:10,631 --> 01:52:13,429
- O'NeaI! - Is everybody okay?

735
01:52:13,511 --> 01:52:16,503
- Turn around. - Why?

736
01:52:29,911 --> 01:52:32,425
''Command Centre, come in.
This is O'NeaI.''

737
01:52:39,031 --> 01:52:40,180
O'NeaI!

738
01:52:54,031 --> 01:52:56,147
''- What's going on? - He's back, sir.''

739
01:52:56,631 --> 01:52:59,429
He's back. GodziIIa is stiII aIive!

740
01:53:01,351 --> 01:53:03,740
Are those F-18's stiII in the air?

741
01:53:05,191 --> 01:53:07,751
- They're heading back to base.
- Turn them around.

742
01:53:38,271 --> 01:53:40,831
- Here. - What are we Iooking for?

743
01:53:40,911 --> 01:53:46,349
Every cab company keeps a record
of its cabs' radio frequencies.

744
01:53:57,791 --> 01:53:59,383
