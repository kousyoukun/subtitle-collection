- You know what that means? - I got a feeling I'm about to find out.

38
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,468
那意味著，由於這場人為事故
It means, because of a man-made accident...

39
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:40,597
造成該地區的蚯蚓平均體積增加了17%

That's what I'm saying. I'm a biologist.

That was a footprint! I was standing inside of a footprint!

49
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:26,393
沒錯
That's right.

50
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,940
但是，世界上還沒有什麼動物有這麼大的腳印
But there's no animal in the world that makes footprints like that, is there?

51
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:36,194
我告訴他們這不是你的領域，但他們不聽天才的話
I told them this is not your field, but they never listen to genius.

- 對，是的　　　　　
- Those were footprints, right? - Yes, they were.

55
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,203
有人看見是什麼東西嗎？
Did anybody see what made them?

56
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:49,499
事實上，沒人有這運氣
Actually, no such luck.

57
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,378
事情發生得太快了，在它經過後才會有人看見
It happened so fast, nobody knew what hit them until it was over.

58
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,922
- 愛絲　　
- 怎麼了？
- Elsie. - Yeah?

59
00:11:56,090 --> 00:12:00,135
錄影帶到了，法國方面的消息
The tape's in. The French finally released it.

We believe it's connected. Dr. Craven, have you met the worm guy?

63
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,898
對不起，熱傷風
Sorry. Summer cold.

64

70
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:22,550
這是精簡後的版本，這使我看起來很專業
This is the midget version. This makes me look like a professional.

71
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,719
可以將它排在五點嗎？
Can we put this on the 5, please?

72
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,888
- 我應不應該問他？
- 不要！　　　　　
- You think I should ask him? - No.

- 現在說這個不是地方
- Did you talk with Humphries? - This is not the place.

76

- 他說會選羅洛或是你　　　
- Just tell me. Did you talk with him? - It's between you and Rodriguez.

77
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,448
是真的? 他要考慮給我工作，他還說了什麼？
You serious? He's gonna consider me for the job? What else did he say?

78
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,328
我們晚飯後再談，在你那裏
Why don't we talk about it over dinner tonight? Your place.

- 是的，但是你非常漂亮
- Mr. Caiman, you're married. - Yes, and you're very beautiful.

- 卡門先生！　　　　　　
- Have I ever told you that before? - Mr. Caiman!

81
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,921
我一直為你搜集資料
I've been doing research for you...

82
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,340
三年多來一直加班加點地工作
...after hours and weekends for over three years.

83
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,593
這工作對我來說很重要
This is a very important job to me.

84
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,595
再做你的助手就太老了
I'm too old to be your assistant anymore.

85
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,848
我需要再進一步做其他工作了
I need to know this job is going someplace.

86
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,851
那今晚和我吃飯

- Really? A girlfriend, or...? - No. Perhaps I work too much.

99
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,317
那麼你是說一直也沒有
So do you mean to tell me there's no one...

100
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,194
一個令你動心的人？

101
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:10,491
沒有，很長一段時間都沒有了

- 我們怎麼會停下？捉到魚了嗎？
- 不像　　　　　　　　　　　　
- How come we stopped? Nets full? - I don't think so.

小心！
Look out!

129
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,897
割斷網繩！
Cut them loose now!

130
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,775
快！快！
Hurry! Hurry!

131
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,740
船在向下沉！
She's going down!

132
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,698
聽見了麼？
Do you hear that?

133
00:20:29,144 --> 00:20:32,897
打擾，先生，我們接到報告，三條漁船沉沒
Excuse me, sir. We just got a report of three fishing trawlers going down.

134
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,069
- 什麼使你覺得這有關聯呢？
- 它們是被拉下去的　　　　
- What makes you think it's related? - The trawlers were pulled under, sir.

135
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,533
我的老天
Jesus Christ...

136
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,161
這東西距離東海岸只有200海哩
It's only 200 miles off the Eastern seaboard...

137
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,080
可是我們卻不知道它是什麼
...and we don't even know what it is.

138
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,748
- 獸腳亞目異龍
- 什麼？　　　
- Theropoda allosaurus. - What?

139
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,250
一種巨大的爬行動物
A type of enormous reptile...

140
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,919
我們認為它在白堊紀就滅絕了
...that we believed died out in the Cretaceous Period.

141
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,630
那麼它在哪裏藏了六千萬年呢？
So where's it been hiding the last 60 million years?

142
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,216
會不會與輻射有關呢？
What about the traces of radiation?

143
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:05,513
輻射的作用不可忽視，這是一個線索
The radiation isn't an anomaly. It's the clue.

144
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,975
這個傢伙就算是恐龍也太大了
This animal is much too big to be some kind of lost dinosaur.

145
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,686
別說它什麼也不是，那你說是什麼？
Don't tell me what it isn't, tell me what it is.

146
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,355
那好，我們來推測一下
Well, what do we know?

147
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:21,028
首先是在法屬波利尼西亞太平洋發現的
It was first sighted off of the French Polynesian Pacific.

148
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:25,032
那地區進行了幾十次核爆試驗
That area has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests.

149
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,369
- 然後有了核輻射
- 不只這樣　　　
- Hence the radiation. - More than that.

150
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:31,872
我認為它是一個變異的物種
I believe it's a mutated aberration.

151
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:34,959
由這個島上核爆產生的輻射塵埃所導致的雜交物種
A hybrid caused by the fallout on these islands.

152
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,961
和你的蚯蚓一樣嗎？
Like your earthworms?

153
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,463
對，是的
Yes. Yes.

154
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,634
我們在尋找一種初次出現的生物
We're looking at a completely incipient creature.

155
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,512
一個新物種的
The dawn of a new species.

156
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,223
第一個個體
The first of its kind.

157
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,330
紐約

158
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:01,810
不夜城

159
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:09,076
- 我的生活太不順了
- 噢，想開點　　　
- My life sucks. - Oh, please.

160
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:13,497
- 你的生活不算不順，他的生活才不順呢
- 因為我娶了你　　　　　　　　　　　
- Your life doesn't suck. His life sucks. - Because I'm married to you.

161
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,583
我給他那麼拚命地工作
I cannot believe he put the moves on me.

162
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,460
他卻一點機會都不給我
After everything I've done for him.

163
00:22:17,627 --> 00:22:19,420
他是個色鬼
He is scum.

164
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,757
對他來說，你只是會說話的乳房
To him, you're just a pair of breasts that talk.

165
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,761
- 真富於想像　　　　　
- 我告訴你，他就是垃圾
- Hey, there's an image. - I'm telling you, he is dirt.

166
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,805
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
他是沖廁所的水、粘痰、狗屎、嘔吐物
He's a douche-bag, gutter-slime' dog-crap puke-chunks.

167
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:31,766
嘿，沒看見我在吃東西嗎？
Hey, you don't see I'm eating?

168
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,478
安琪，你太善良了
Audrey, you're too damn nice.

169
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:39,940
這就是你的弱點，好人在這裏辦不成什麼事
That's your problem. Nice gets you nothing in this town.

170
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,778
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
在這個人吃人的社會，你必須不擇手段向上爬
It's dog-eat-dog. You gotta be a killer to get ahead.

171
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,948
很抱歉，寶貝，你缺乏這種卑鄙的手段
I'm sorry, baby, but you just don't got what it takes.

172
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:53,287
- 你認為這對嗎？　　
- 非常對，你人太好了
- Do you think that's true? - Pretty much. You're a nice person.

173
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:56,374
好人沒好報
Nice guys finish last.

174
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,795
- 只要我想那麼做的話我也會很卑鄙
- 當然　　　　　　　　　　　　　
- I can be tough if I want. - Yeah, sure.

175
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:04,298
我可以，我可以的
I can. I can.

176
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:08,010
- 難點，呵呵，難點
- 畢竟…　　　　　
- No, yeah, no. - Whatever.

177
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,805
哦，我的天！
Oh, my God!

178
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,142
哦，我的天！能把音量提高點嗎？
Oh, my God! Could you turn that up please?

179
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:20,481
在過去的12小時裏，仍然沒有什麼進展…
- Sometime in the last 12 hours. It is not known yet...

180
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,651
- 是尼克　
- 他是誰？
- It's Nick. - Who is he?

181
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:27,988
他是我大學時的朋友，他在電視裏很英俊
He was my college sweetie. He looks so handsome on TV.

182
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,575
墜機現場守衛森嚴
There is tight security around the crash site...

183
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:36,831
可能因為機上有敏感的貨物
...possibly due to the sensitive military cargo on the plane.

184
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:51,178
快點卸貨，我渾身濕透了
You wanna unload this thing? I'm getting soaked here.

185
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,222
快點，夥計們
Come on, will you?

186
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:02,273
嘿，喬！想釣條小魚嗎？
Hey, Joe! Gonna catch one of them little fish in the East River?

187
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,275
希望如此
I hope so.

188
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:06,610
但是你永遠不會想到
But you never know.

189
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,905
我是說，今天是我的幸運日
I mean, today could be my lucky day.

190
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,366
我看你凍感冒還差不多
The only thing you'll catch is a cold.

191
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,589
嘿
Hey.

192
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,260
有魚上鉤了
I got a bite.

193
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:36,640
小子，真有魚上鉤了
Boy, do I have a bite!

194
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,522
不要讓它跑了，喬，你逮到大傢伙了，堅持住
Don't let up on him, Joe. You got a big one, baby. Hold on to it.

195
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,900
你還想跑？
You want to fight?

196
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,919
女士們，先生們，你們一直在等待的人在這裏
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen, the man you've all been waiting for.

197
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:33,090
使紐約治安更加好的艾波特市長！
Yours for a safer New York, your mayor, Mayor Ebert!

198
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,469
謝謝，謝謝
Thank you. Thank you.

199
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:42,558
感謝你們在這種好天氣下來到這裏
I want to thank you all for coming out on this beautiful New York City day.

200
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,522
四年前人們不相信我能降低犯罪
Four years ago, people didn't think I would reduce crime.

201
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,233
但是我辦到了！
But I did!

202
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,046
哦，我的天
Oh, my God.

203
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,899
快跑！讓我們離開這裏！
Move! Let's get out of here!

204
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,703
很高興我們爭取到了新節目
I'm grateful we're getting a new set.

205
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,414
我知道那代表管理委員會的意見
I know that represents a commitment from management.

206
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:49,375
可是我就不理解了
Here's what I don't understand:

207
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,460
為什麼把城裏唯一的
Why we're the only station in town...

208
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,588
韓國雜貨店作為我們的頭條新聞
...that doesn't have the Korean grocery holdup as our lead.

209
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,633
- 我們的頭條是什麼？又下雨了！
- 媽媽？　　　　　　　　　　　
- What's our lead? Rain, again! - Mom?

210
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:01,428
我知道你去的酒會上的人都很漂亮
I know, it impresses the people at the parties you go to that we're classy.

211
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,348
可是我不想用那麼重要的檔期來播
Sorry, I just don't give a rat's ass about a war...

212
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,518
一個人名都不好發音的屁大點國家的屁事上
...in some country whose name I can't even pronounce.

213
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:12,022
- 怎麼就沒有大新聞？
- 先生？　　　　　　
- How about a real story? - Sir?

214
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,776
我認為你要的大新聞就在窗外
I think your story just walked by the window.

215
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,823
什麼？
What?

216
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,035
可能我們能進到韓國雜貨店的醫務室裏
Maybe we can get in the Korean grocer's hospital room.

217
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:29,289
- 你的羅密歐叫什麼名？
- 尼克泰托·帕利斯　　
- So did this Romeo have a name? - Nick Tatopoulos.

218
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,710
- 天哪，這就是你為什麼甩了他？
- 不是　　　　　　　　　　　　
- Jesus. Is that why you dumped him? - No.

219
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:37,464
- 你們有多少年？
- 大約四年　　　
- How long did you go out for anyway? - Nearly four years.

220
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,467
我很奇怪，他為什麼不向你求婚？
Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him.

221
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,137
這就是問題所在
Well, that's the problem.

222
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,805
他求過
He did.

223
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:49,184
我希望那不是遊行
Tell me that's not another parade.

224
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,479
我不認為是遊行
I don't think that's a parade.

225
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,276
請等待進一步報導
Please stand by.

226
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,695
那到底是什麼？
What the hell is that?

227
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:14,168
你沒事吧？沒受傷吧？沒事吧樣？
Are you all right? Are you cut? You all right?

228
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,673
維克多，別發瘋！
Victor! Don't be stupid.

229
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,844
我的老天爺啊，這真是…
Jesus, Mary and Joseph! That is really...

230
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:27,681
太大了
That is large.

231
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,267
- 哦，我的天
- 哦，我的天
- Oh, my God. - Oh, my God!

232
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,940
快點，媽的，快點！
Come on, you bastard. Come on!

233
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:41,570
維克多，快回來，你個白癡！
Victor, get back here, you retard!

234
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,372
誰來做點什麼啊
Somebody do something!

235
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,757
快點！快點！
Come on! Come on!

236
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,527
你能告訴我們發生了什麼事麼？
Can you tell us what's going on?

237
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,112
看哪
Watch it!

238
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:14,520
機動部隊指揮中心 － 新澤西

239
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,295
- 上士歐尼爾，長官　　
- 市長辦公室有消息嗎？
- Sergeant O'Neal, sir. - Any word from the mayor's office?

240
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:25,299
有，長官，他們主張疏散市區，他們還調動了國民警衛隊
Yes, sir. They've agreed to evacuate the city. They've called the National Guard.

241
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,885
疏散曼哈頓？那可是三百萬人
Evacuate Manhattan? That's over 3 million people.

242
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:30,554
- 以前這麼做過麼？
- 好像沒有　　　　
- Has that ever been done before? - I don't think so.

243
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,558
- 他現在在什麼地方？　　
- 我們失去它的蹤影，長官
- Where is he now? - We lost sight of it, sir.

244
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,977
你再說一遍
You wanna run that by me again?

245
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:41,481
第一次攻擊之後
After its initial attack, he...

246
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,151
它就消失了
...disappeared.

247
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,987
國防部長來電找你
Secretary of Defense Burk is on the line.

248
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,658
怎麼可能，這麼大的東西一下子就消失了？
I don't understand. How can something so big just disappear?

249
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,493
- 我們不知道，但是…
- 好的，好的　　　　
- We're not sure, but... - Yeah, yeah.

250
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:57,164
- 它可能回到河裏了
- 我不這樣認為　　
- He probably returned to the river. - I don't think so.

251
00:31:57,332 --> 00:32:03,462
你們看看，這個島四面環海
I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An island, water on all sides.

252
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,761
很適合它這個大傢伙藏身
But like no other island in the world' it's a place where he can easily hide.

253
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,096
它就在這裏的某個地方
He's in there someplace.

254
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,932
第十二頻道有報導了

你是說我要在選舉月疏散全市嗎？
You're telling me, in an election month I evacuated this city for nothing?

上面建築的地板沒了
We were checking the building above and we discovered the floor was gone.

348
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:22,359
我麼發現它會打洞
When we discovered that he could burrow his way through the tunnels...

349
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,404
我們意識到它可能不在這地區
...we realized he could be outside the quarantine zone.

350
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,114
我的老天
Holy Christ.

351
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:33,119
- 有多少通道出入這個島？　　　　　　　　
- 十四條，我們已檢查過，沒有它到過的痕跡
- How many tunnels lead off the island? - Only 14. He hasn't used any of them.

352
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:36,164
- 將它們都封死
- 是，長官　　
- Have them all sealed up. - Yes, sir.

353
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,627
怎麼？怎麼封閉？
How? How would we do that, sir?

354
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:46,049
用水泥、磚頭，我不管用什麼
Fill them with cement, brick them up, put landmines in them. I don't care!

355
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,885
- 確保它不會離開這個島
- 是的，長官　　　　　
Make sure the damn thing doesn't leave the island.

356
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,895
你要知道，它並不是敵人
You know, he's not some enemy trying to evade you.

357
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,563
它只是一個動物

358
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,524
那你的建議是什麼？
What are you suggesting?

359
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,943
當我想捉蚯蚓時
Well, when I had to catch earthworms...

360
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,987
最好的辦法就是引它們出來
...I knew the best way to get them was not to dig them out...

361
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,614
而不是挖它們出來
...but to draw them out.

362
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:15,620
我們弄明白它需要什麼後，它就會聽你的
All we need to do is to find out what he needs, and he'll come to you.

363
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:38,435

- I sure hope this plan of yours works. - I'm kind of hoping that myself.

377
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:16,866
- 你贊成這樣做麼？
- 他們說做法很適當
- Did you approve this? - They just appropriated it.

378
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,910
12輛城市環衛車
Twelve of the city's dump trucks.

379
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:21,204
可以告訴我怎麼回事嗎？
Would you like to tell me what's going on here?

380
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,791
不可以，除此之外，你什麼也別碰
Actually, no, I wouldn't. And don't touch anything.

381
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:28,002
- 進行的怎麼樣，歐尼爾？
- 一切都按計劃，長官　　
- How's O'Neal doing? - Everything is on schedule, sir.

382
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,881
- 你真的不明白怎麼回事嗎？
- 沒人告訴我啊　　　　　　
- Sure you didn't know about this? - No one told me anything about this.

383
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:34,008
為什麼我到現在還留著你？
Why do I even keep you around?

384
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,183
倒出來！
Dump!

385
00:42:49,285 --> 00:42:54,028
- 很奇怪，不是嗎？
- 不，很聰明　　　
No. Very clever.

386
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:59,993
好的，堆起來，我們離開這裏
All right, let's pile it on, and let's get out of here.

387
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,832
好多魚啊
That's a lot of fish.

388
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,820
來吧，畜生，是晚飯時間了
Come on, you bastard, it's suppertime.

389
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,492
看上去都是凍魚，這樣會有效嗎？
Look at all that frigging fish. Is this gonna work?

390
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:04,932
我們來打開下水道口，讓它聞到魚腥味
We gotta get the manholes uncovered. We want him to smell the bait.

391
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,726
快點！
Come on.

392
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,104
快走！快走！
Let's go! Let's go!

393
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:16,569
快點，夥計們
Come on, guys.

394
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:23,951
- 打開蓋子，快！快！
- 他在做什麼？　　　
- Let's get those lids off. Go, go! - What the hell is he doing?

395
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,705
- 好的，這邊，這邊，快點！
- 我們走！　　　　　　　　
- Okay, this way, this way. Come on. - Let's go!

396
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,749
快點，那邊！
Come on. Over there!

397
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,086
- 這個　　　
- 是的，先生
- This one. - Yes, sir.

398
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,468
- 給我鉤子
- 先生　　
- Give me the crowbar. - Sir.

399
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,413
就在這，我已瞄準
Set up here. I've got a shot.

400
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,193
我是阿爾法查爾
This is Six Alpha Charlie.

401
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:05,530
我們在前進，不能停止，我們在前進！
We gotta move. We can't stay put, we gotta move!

402
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,921
快走啊，後撤
Let's go, fall back!

403
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,971
走，走，走！
Go, go, go!

404
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,645
我們需要重武器
We need bigger guns.

405
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,983
- 我們失去聯繫了　　　
- 重新連線，自由開火！
- We've lost communications. - Get us back online. Fire at will!

406
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:25,610
上士，自由開火！
Sergeant, fire at will!

407
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,778
開火！開火！開火！
Fire! Fire! Fire!

408
00:49:17,454 --> 00:49:19,664
歐尼爾，進展怎麼樣？
O'Neal, you better tell me what's going on.

409
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:23,542
它跑了，埃寇機開始追蹤
He's gone, sir, he's gone. Echo unit in pursuit.

410
00:49:36,598 --> 00:49:37,723
跟我來
Follow my lead.

411
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,823
全系統裝備完畢，4號機裝備完畢
All systems armed. Echo 4 armed.

412
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:02,623
我們已經時速80節了，可還是追不上它，長官
We're doing 80 knots and he's pulling away, sir.

413
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,126
我已鎖定目標
I've got him locked on.

414
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:08,546
- 鎖定了，目標鎖定
- 發射導彈　　　　
- Locked on, sir. Target is locked on. - Fire the damn missile.

415
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:11,716
- 埃寇１至４號，自由開火！
- 發射響尾蛇導彈　　　　　
- Echo 1 through 4, fire at will. - Fire sidewinders.

416
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:44,290
媽的，命中錯誤，再說一遍，命中錯誤
Damn! That is a negative impact. I repeat, that is a negative impact.

417
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,834
- 命中錯誤，長官
- 命中錯誤？　　
- Negative impact, sir. - "Negative impact"?

418
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,462
擊中了我們的克律大廈！
That's the damn Chrysler Building we're talking about.

419
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:53,007
- 你告訴我已瞄準目標　　　　
- 埃寇１，你不是說鎖定了麼？
- You told me he had it locked on. - Echo 1, we had you locked on.

420
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:56,510
那是熱能制導導彈，不能追蹤冷血動物
The heat-seekers can't lock. He's colder than the buildings around him.

421
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:02,975
福瑞迪，福瑞迪！福瑞迪！
Freddie. Freddie! Freddie!

422
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:06,020
- 怎麼了？怎麼了？　
- 在被抓之前趕快跑啊
- What? What? - Let's go before we get caught.

423
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,105
吉米，你知道我的預感一向很準
Jimmy. You know that bad feeling I get...

424
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,316
尤其是什麼不好的事情要發生時
...when something really bad is gonna happen?

425
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:12,485
我現在就有這種感覺，哥們
I'm getting that feeling right now, man.

426
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:25,164
- 下降３００英尺，開啟鐳射光
- 目標１１點鐘方向　　　　　
- Descend to 300 feet. Lasers on. - Target, 11 o'clock.

427
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,861
它去哪了？
Where'd he go?

428
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:07,331
埃寇戰機，靠攏，夥計們，準備開火
Echo flight, get it together, guys. Prepare to fire.

429
00:52:07,499 --> 00:52:10,751
- ４號機準備好
- ２號機準備好
- Echo 4, ready. - Echo 2, ready.

430
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:13,045
開火！
Fire!

431
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,982
我想我們擊中它了
I think we got him.

432
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,788
我們丟了1號和2號機，長官
We've lost Echo 1 and 2, sir.

433
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,583
埃寇4號，目標在哪？
Echo 4, where is target?

434
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,590
天哪，它就在我後面，長官
Jesus! He's right on my tail, sir.

435
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,262
我甩不掉它
I don't think I can shake him.

436
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,941
我大概甩掉它了
I think I lost him.

437
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,159
4號…4號機也完了，長官
We've... We've lost Echo 4, sir.

438
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,996
你的人有毛病嗎？
What's the matter with you people?

439
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,208
你們造成的損失比它還要大
You've caused more damage than that goddamn thing did!

440
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:35,920
- 消消氣，吃塊糖　
- 別煩我，讓我待會
- Calm down. Have some candy. - I don't want any. Leave me alone!

441
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,781
真難以置信
I can't believe it. I mean...

442
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,536
看著它為所欲為，我們卻拿它沒辦法
He did all of this, and we did nothing to him.

443
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:13,457
也不是啊，起碼我們餵飽了它
That's not true. We fed him.

444
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,713
這是新澤西指揮中心
Here at the command center in New Jersey...

445
00:54:19,881 --> 00:54:21,882
沒有什麼新的進展
...there is no new information to report.

446
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:27,388
軍方對外界進行了新聞封鎖
The military has clamped a media blackout on whatever is going on.

447
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:29,348
目前得不到任何有關報導
Officials are not saying anything...

448
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:33,978
關於如何截留和控制怪獸的行動也一無所知
...about their attempts to contain or control this creature, and now I see...

449
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:37,273
情況已經得到控制
No, the situation is under control.

450
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,859
已經得到控制，我們有辦法制伏它
It's under control, we have containment.

451
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,877
- 請問你要買藥麼？
- 是的　　　　　　
- Can I help you, young man? - Yes.

452
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:01,588
有妊娠試盒嗎？
Do you have any at-home pregnancy tests?

453
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:04,675
那種含有生殖荷爾蒙…
Especially ones that look for gonadotropic hormones...

454
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:06,927
或者排卵激素的？
...or clomiphene citrate?

455
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,721
我不知道，這個…
I don't know. This...

456
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:10,597
這個…
This...

457
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:14,435
- 都在這裏了
- 我都要　　
- This is all we've got. - I'll take all of them.

458
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:17,855
哇噢，你大概有許多妻妾
Wow, you must have quite some harem.

459
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:25,070
安琪，我的天，是你嗎？你在這裏做什麼？
Audrey? Oh, my Go... Is that you? What are you doing here?

460
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:27,156
嗨，好啊
Hi. Hello.

461
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:30,075
- 哇！多少錢？
- ４６美元　　
- Wow. How much is that? - $46.

462
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:34,371
上帝，你看上去…哦，近年來過的怎麼樣？
God, you look... Wow! How have you been?

463
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:36,665
見到你很高興，尼克
It's good to see you, Nick.

464
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:41,128
- 你得償所願了
- 什麼？　　　
- So you made it. - What?

465
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,589
你成記者了，不是麼？
You're a reporter, huh?

466
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:47,092
你一直想的就是做這個，我真高興，真的
No, that's good. That's good. That's what you always wanted.

467
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:51,221
我真為你高興，真的
I'm happy for you. Really, I am.

468
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,028
你還生我的氣嗎？
You're still mad at me?

469
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:10,866
你離開這麼久一個電話，一封信都沒有
Well, you left without a phone call, a letter, nothing. All this time.

470
00:56:11,034 --> 00:56:14,787
是，我猜我還有點生氣
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I am still a little mad.

471
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,958
已經八年了，有些人會改變的
That was eight years ago. Some people change.

472
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,294
大多數人卻不會變
Most people don't.

473
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:28,133
我很遺憾你這樣想
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.

474
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:33,430
安琪
Audrey.

475
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:41,021
你說得對，八年是很長的時間
You're right. Eight years is a long time.

476
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:43,065
可以請你喝杯茶嗎？
Can I make you a cup of tea?

477
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:49,154
當然，太好了
Sure, that'd be nice.

478
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:51,198
我還是不能相信
I still can't believe it.

479
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:53,617
為什麼一個反對核能應用的人
How does a guy go from anti-nuke activist...

480
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:56,829
和核能工作者一起工作？
...to working for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission?

481
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:01,583
當你和我參加反核示威時
When you and I went to rallies together in college...

482
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,128
我們是想引起注意
...we helped to create awareness.

483
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:09,174
但現在，我能從內部引起真正的變化
But now, from the inside, I'm able to effect real change.

484
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:12,469
能有什麼變化？
Exactly what changes are you trying to effect?

485
00:57:12,637 --> 00:57:15,222
我在準備為政府做一個普查
I'm preparing a census for the government.

486
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,308
我將對所有因為核污染所產生的
I'm cataloging new species that have been created...

487
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,561
新物種進行分類
...as a direct result of nuclear contamination.

488
00:57:20,937 --> 00:57:23,355
那就是其中之一嗎？
Is that what you think created this thing?

489
00:57:23,523 --> 00:57:26,650
是，我今天找到了一個血樣
Yeah. I found a blood sample earlier this evening.

490
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,863
- 你離它很近？
- 非常近　　　
- How close did you get to the thing? - I got pretty close.

491
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:38,036
- 你還發現了什麼？　　　
- 我們知道它吃了成噸的魚
- And what else did you find out? - Well, we know he eats tons of fish.

492
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:42,875
它是兩棲動物，能夠挖洞，並且…
He's amphibious. He's a burrower. And...

493
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,049
它懷孕了
...he's pregnant.

494
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:57,890
- 它懷孕？　　　　
- 對，會懷孕的雄性
- He is? - He's a very unusual he.

495
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,269
這些驗孕藥不是為它而設計的
I mean, obviously these tests weren't designed for this...

496
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:06,899
但對懷孕分泌荷爾蒙反應卻完全一樣
...but fundamentally they look for the same hormonal patterns...
...to indicate pregnancy.

497
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:11,236
我不明白，如果它是第一個，怎麼懷孕呢？
I don't get it. If he's the first of his kind, how can he be pregnant?

498
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:12,779
它不需要配偶麼？
Doesn't he need a mate?

499
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,948
它能無性繁殖
Not if he reproduces asexually.

500
00:58:16,117 --> 00:58:17,910
怎麼回事？
Where's the fun in that?

501
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:24,124
我一直在想，它為什麼來這裏
I kept thinking' why would he travel so far?

502
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,084
這就是充足的理由
But it makes perfect sense.

503
00:58:26,294 --> 00:58:30,714
許多動物長途跋涉，就是為了繁殖
Lots of animals travel great distances for reproduction.

504
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:35,135
這就是它來這裏的原因，它在築巢
That's what he's doing in New York. He's nesting.

505
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,429
- 築巢？
- 是的　
- Nesting? - Yes.

506
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:42,601
你知道一個蜥蜴一次可下12個以上的蛋嗎？
Do you realize that a lizard can lay up to 12 eggs at a time?

507
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:45,729
- 想想看　
- 我不知道
- Think of it. - I didn't know that.

508
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:50,943
對不起，我要拿這個去實驗室證實一下
Forgive me, I have to get this to the lab and see if I can confirm all this.

509
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,613
我一會就回來
I'll be right back.

510
01:00:58,738 --> 01:01:01,198
來吧，寶貝，這裏什麼也沒有
Come on, Joey' there's nothing down here.

511
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,367
我告訴你，夥計，我聽到…
I'm telling you, man, I heard...

512
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,077
我聽到些什麼
I heard something.

513
01:01:05,244 --> 01:01:08,038
你什麼也不會聽到，那是死胡同
You heard nothing. It's a dead end.

514
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:19,132
有什麼麼？
Anything?

515
01:01:20,593 --> 01:01:24,137
什麼也沒有
No. Nothing down here.

516
01:01:24,931 --> 01:01:26,640
一點都沒有
Nothing at all.

517
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:39,444
這就是事情的由來
This is why, in this case, all the king's horses and all the king's men...

518
01:01:39,612 --> 01:01:42,155
看來無論怎樣也不能令紐約回復原狀了
...may not be able to put the Big Apple together again.

519
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:43,907
安琪·迪曼茲，WIDF新聞
Audrey Timmonds, WIDF News.

520
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,117
好的！
Yes!

521
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,785
- 你要請我喝啤酒
- 喜歡麼？　　　
- You owe me a beer. - Like it?

522
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,745
- 好啊　　　　　　　
- 我不應將頭發放肩後
- Yeah. - I should've worn my hair back.

523
01:01:48,913 --> 01:01:50,539
- 看起來挺好的
- 好的，好的　
- No, it looks great. - Good, good.

524
01:01:50,748 --> 01:01:54,292
你怎麼拿到這些的？
How did you get ahold of this?

525
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:59,297
像你說的，好人辦不成事
Well, you know. It's like you said, nice guys finish last.

526
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:01,967
- 謝謝，我愛你
- 太棒了　　　
- Thank you. I love you. - Oh, yeah, sure.

527
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:03,427
怎麼？
What...?

528
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:13,645
梅利！梅利！過來一下
Murray. Murray! Come here a second.

529
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:16,857
等一會，好麼？怎麼了？
Hold on a second, all right? What is it?

530
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:20,110
我有它襲擊其他地方的資料
I've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked.

531
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,528
- 你確定？
- 是的　　
- You do? - Yeah.

532
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,322
- 誰的消息？
- 我的　　　
- Whose story is that? - Mine.

533
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:38,003
大隊人馬移向那裏
There's a lot of movement down there.

534
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:40,756
軍隊，警察…
Military, police...

535
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:45,927
- 這是我的早餐
- 我餓了　　　
- It's my breakfast. - I'm hungry.

536
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:47,262
安靜！
Quiet!

537
01:02:47,472 --> 01:02:49,681
如果我們能將它引入開闊地
If we can lure him into a more open area...

538
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,727
比如說中央公園，我們就能制服它
...such as this portion of Central Park, we should be able to take him down.

539
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:56,646
- 上次你沒傷著它一根毫毛
- 不對　　　　　　　　　
- Last time you didn't even scratch it. - That's not true.

540
01:02:56,814 --> 01:02:58,648
我的意思是，我的蚯蚓佬
My worm guy, I mean...

541
01:02:58,816 --> 01:03:02,652
- 泰托·帕利斯博士取到了血
- 對，我拿到了　　　　　　
...Dr. Tatopoulos has found blood. - Yes, I did.

542
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:06,114
現在唯一需要做的就是引它去空曠處
See, the only thing we need to do is get him out into open terrain...

543
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:09,284
然後使用非熱能跟蹤武器
...and use weapons that don't rely on heat-seeking technology...

544
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:14,998
對不起，我認為現在情況更複雜了
Excuse me, sir. I think the situation has become more complicated than that.

545
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:20,212
我收集到的血樣顯示它要下蛋
The blood I collected revealed that the creature is either about to lay eggs...

546
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:22,339
或者已經下了
...or already has.

547
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:26,218
你是說還有另一隻嗎？
Are you trying to tell us that there's another of those things out there?

548
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,845
不，我認為還沒有
No, no, governor, I don't believe so.

549
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:32,557
等一下，等一下，那它怎麼會懷孕？
Wait a minute, wait. Then how can it be pregnant?

550
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:35,018
它是什麼？不是處女蜥蜴麼？
What is this, the Virgin Lizard?

551
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:38,980
不，不，它會無性繁殖
No, no, it reproduces asexually.

552
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:42,526
所以我們要盡快找到它的巢穴
That's why we have to find the nest as soon as possible.

553
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,694
否則一旦十二個幼仔被孵化出來
Otherwise up to a dozen will be born...

554
01:03:44,862 --> 01:03:48,740
它們又各自繁殖後代
...each one capable of laying eggs on its own.

555
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:51,743
它們的數量會非常迅速地增加
Very quickly we could be looking at an enormous population.

556
01:03:51,911 --> 01:03:54,746
那麼我們先幹掉它，再尋找它的巢穴
So after we kill the creature, then we search for the nest.

557
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:57,040
不，我認為那可能就太晚了
No, I think it might be too late by then.

558
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:59,543
這些蛋很快就會孵化
These eggs are going to hatch very quickly.

559
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,379
- 你怎麼知道這些？
- 是魚　　　　　　
- How could you possibly know that? - The fish.

560
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,423
我發現在地鐵裏有魚
The fish that we found on the subway.

561
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,385
那不是為它自己準備的
He's not collecting all this food just for himself.

562
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,263
它在為它的後代準備食物
He's preparing to feed his young.

563
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,143
有這個人的資料嗎？
Do we have something on this guy?

564
01:04:19,772 --> 01:04:23,233
尼克·塔…塔托教授
Professor Nick Ta... Tat... Tato...

565
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:26,611
他們叫他「蚯蚓佬」
They call him "the worm guy."

566
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:33,410
待在那裏等我們的特別報導
Stay tuned for a special report.

567
01:04:34,245 --> 01:04:36,121
你去哪兒啦？
Excuse us, please. Where you been?

568
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:38,790
- 就該到你了
- 哦，好啊　
- Your spot is up right after this. - Oh, good.

569
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:44,254
- 能大點音量麼？　　
- 請問能大點音量嗎？
- Could you turn it up, please? - Can you turn it up, please? The TV?

570
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:48,466
如果泰托帕利斯博士說得對，我們就要抓緊行動，避免事態升級
If Dr. Tatopoulos is right, we have to act quickly, before this problem escalates.

571
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,803
你想根據一些不切實際的理論來分散我們的力量嗎？
You want to divide our efferts based solely on some wild theory?

572
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:54,806
尼克幫助過我們
Sir, Nick's come through for us before, and if he feels...

573
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:57,642
幫助？上次行動簡直是一場災難
Come through for you? Your campaign's a disaster.

574
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:00,770
你竟然不能將這東西趕出曼哈頓
You weren't even able to keep this thing out of Manhattan.

575
01:05:00,938 --> 01:05:04,482
打擾一下，先生們，我們應該看看這個
Excuse me, gentlemen, but I think we should see this.

576
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:09,029
曼哈頓的新害蟲繼續破壞
- Methods and motivations of Manhattan's newest unwanted pest.

577
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,826
哥斯拉
"Godzilla."

578
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:19,289
哥斯拉——日本船員稱之為神話中的海龍
That's what Japanese sailors called him in song, a mythological sea dragon...

579
01:05:19,457 --> 01:05:21,333
它使他們心中充滿恐懼
...who filled their hearts with fear.

580
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,169
- 哦，天哪！他竟然偷了我的報導
- 是啊，我知道　　　　　　　　
- Oh, my God! He stole my report! - Yeah, I know.

581
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,880
如今神話成真，我們的都市面臨劫難
That myth has become reality, our modern-day terror.

582
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:29,716
- 簡直難以置信　　　
- 哥斯拉是什麼東西？
- I don't believe it! - Who is this Godzilla?

583
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,011
它從哪裏來？它為什麼來？
Where did he come from? Why is he here?

584
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:36,556
就是哥斯拉，你這傻瓜
And it's "Gojira, you moron!

585
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:40,477
已發現從曼哈頓到法屬波利尼西亞的痕跡
A direct path can be traced from Manhattan to French Polynesia...

586
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,355
那裏多年來進行核爆試驗
...where nuclear tests have been going on for two decades.

587
01:05:43,522 --> 01:05:47,609
泰托帕利斯博士認為那生物正在築巢
Researcher Dr. Tapadopoulos believes the creature may be nesting...

588
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:50,904
利用曼哈頓的地勢來傳宗接代
...using Manhattan as ground zero to cultivate the species.

589
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:54,407
軍方至今為止仍然否認
This, despite the fact that the combined might of the U.S. Military...

590
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,201
上述消息的真實性
...has been unable to subdue...

591
01:05:56,369 --> 01:05:58,745
- 你向傳媒透露這些？
- 不是　　　　　　　
- You went to the press with this? - No.

592
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:02,040
- 不，我沒告訴任何人
- 他們都提到你的名字
- No, I haven't talked to anyone. - They mentioned you by name!

593
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:03,500
是啊，是啊
Yeah. Yeah.

594
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:07,420
- 你給他們磁帶了？　　
- 不，我沒給他們錄像帶
- You gave them the tape? - No, I didn't give them the tape.

595
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,423
它還在我的帳篷裏
No, it's in my tent right now.

596
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,384
哦，我的天哪
Oh, my God.

597
01:06:12,843 --> 01:06:14,886
哦，我的天哪，她拿去了！
Oh, my God, she took it.

598
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:22,102
捲鋪蓋回家吧，你不能繼續這計劃了
Pack your stuff, mister. You're officially off this project, as of now.

599
01:06:34,156 --> 01:06:35,615
怎麼啦？
What's going on?

600
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,453
我要走了
We're leaving.

601
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:49,796
這件事我很抱歉
I'm so sorry about all this.

602
01:06:53,968 --> 01:06:58,096
一定要保證希克盡快找到巢穴
Make sure that Hicks finds that nest before it's too late.

603
01:06:59,098 --> 01:07:00,765
我會盡力
I'll try.

604
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,279
什麼意思？他不在那？
What do you mean, he's not there?

605
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:16,781
你剛剛說他在線上
A second ago you said he was on the other line.

606
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:20,493
緊急情況，是，尼克泰托·帕勒斯
Please, it's urgent. I really need to talk to him. Yes. Nick Tatopoulos.

607
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:37,343
你要走嗎？為什麼？
You're leaving? Why?

608
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:41,473
因為我的報導嗎？
Is it because of me? Because of the story?

609
01:07:41,640 --> 01:07:46,770
- 你以為會發生什麼事？
- 你沒有說是不能發表的
- What did you think would happen? - You never said it was off the record.

610
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:51,316
我認為不必說，安琪，我一直認為你是我的朋友
I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You were supposed to be my friend.

611
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:53,109
我信任你
I trusted you.

612
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:00,200
尼克，有些事我想告訴你
Nick, there's something I have to tell you.

613
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:05,205
我撒謊了，我不是記者
Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter.

614
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:15,215
來紐約時，我肯定自己會成功
When we broke up and I first came out to New York, I was so sure I'd make it.

615
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,008
但我沒做到
But I haven't.

616
01:08:17,927 --> 01:08:21,387
所以我不惜一切搶頭條
That's why I needed the story so bad.

617
01:08:21,555 --> 01:08:24,224
我不能告訴你我是個失敗者
I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure.

618
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,566
這樣就可以偷我的錄影帶嗎？
And you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes?

619
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:37,987
不，那麼做實在太過分了，我不該那樣
No. It was a terrible thing to do. I never should've have done that.

620
01:08:44,203 --> 01:08:49,082
祝你前程似錦，你很有天分
Good luck with your new career. I really think you have what it takes.

621
01:08:49,250 --> 01:08:51,209
奈瓦克機場
Newark Airport.

622
01:09:01,053 --> 01:09:02,762
對不起
I'm sorry.

623
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,394
嘿，原諒她一次吧，好麼？
Hey, yo! Come on, give her a break, will you?

624
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,420
機場

625
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:41,634
這是去機場最近的路嗎？
Excuse me, is this the best way to the airport?

626
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:51,769
先生，你去哪？喂！
Sir, where are you going? Hey, hello!

627
01:09:55,107 --> 01:09:58,776
停車，停下，現在就婷！
Okay, stop. Stop the car, right now.

628
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:01,654
讓我下車
Now let me out of here.

629
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:06,534
恐怕我不能
I'm afraid I can't do that.

630
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:10,955
嘿，我認識你
Hey, I know you, don't I?

631
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,128
- 你是那保險人員　
- 費利普·羅切探員
- Yeah. You're that insurance guy. - Agent Philippe Roache.

632
01:10:17,442 --> 01:10:19,468
DGSE

633
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:23,468
聽起來很嚇人
Sounds big.

634
01:10:25,763 --> 01:10:27,555
法國安全局
French Secret Service.

635
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:32,977
你的美國朋友們
I thought you'd like to know that your American friends...

636
01:10:33,145 --> 01:10:36,189
決定不再找它的巢穴
...have decided not to look for the creature's nest.

637
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,317
什麼？你怎麼知道？
What? Are you sure? How do you know that?

638
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:42,403
- 我們知道，相信我
- 相信你？　　　　
- We know. Trust me. - Trust you?

639
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:45,490
你協持我，還叫我相信你？
You hijack me and you expect me to trust you?

640
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:48,034
- 是　　　　　　　　
- 為什麼我要相信你？
- Yes. - And why should I do that?

641
01:10:48,661 --> 01:10:54,499
因為只有我們希望找到巢穴
Because you are the only one who wants to find the nest as much as I do.

642
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,528
你怎樣運這些入境？
How did you get all this stuff into the country?

643
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:26,281
這是美國，什麼都買得到
This is America. You can buy anything.

644
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:28,533
但是為什麼秘密行動？
But why all the secrecy?

645
01:11:28,701 --> 01:11:31,077
你們為什麼不和美軍合作？
Why aren't you guys working with the U.S. Military?

646
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:34,330
我不能談論這些事
I'm not permitted to speak of such things.

647
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:39,043
你說你需要我的信任，但我也需要你的
Hey, you said you needed my trust. Well, then I need yours.

648
01:11:41,755 --> 01:11:45,091
我是愛國者，我愛我的國家，你明白嗎？
I am a patriot. I love my country. You understand that?

649
01:11:45,342 --> 01:11:46,592
當然
Sure.

650
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,803
我有責任保衛我的國家
It's my job to protect my country.

651
01:11:49,179 --> 01:11:53,641
儘管有時他也犯一些錯誤
Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we've made.

652
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,686
不能讓人知道的錯誤
Mistakes that we don't want the world to know about.

653
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,939
- 太平洋的核爆試驗？
- 對　　　　　　　　
- The nuclear tests in the Pacific? - Yes.

654
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,401
他們留下一堆爛攤子
This testing done by my country left a terrible mess.

655
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:05,987
要我們收拾
We're here to clean it up.

656
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:10,400
- 有新聞嗎？
- 沒有　　　


657
01:12:17,291 --> 01:12:19,751
他們好像要在晚上8點左右再次設置魚餌陷阱
They are setting the next fish trap at 8-something.

658
01:12:20,377 --> 01:12:25,590
我們知道如何進入城市，但不知道如何找到它們
We know how to get into the city' we just don't know where to look.

659
01:12:32,765 --> 01:12:36,309
這兒，第二十三街地鐵站
Here. This is the 23rd Street subway station.

660
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:40,271
找到魚的地方，應該從這裏開始找
That's where we first found the fish. That'd a good place to start looking.

661
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,106
你會加入嗎？
So you're in?

662
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:49,487
- 對，對，我加入
- 太棒了　　　　
Yeah. Yeah, I'm in.

663
01:12:50,824 --> 01:12:53,868
我總想加入法國海外兵團
I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion.

664
01:13:04,838 --> 01:13:06,964
- 你好　　　　
- 進展怎麼樣？
- Hello. - How's it going?

665
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:18,017
對不起，借過，對不起
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

666
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,645
- 甜心　　
- 嘿，寶貝
- Honey. - Hi, sweetie.

667
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,189
- 這些是什麼人？
- 什麼？　　　　
- Who the hell are all these people? - What?

668
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:26,401
我不能讓他們睡在街上
I couldn't just let them sleep on the street.

669
01:13:30,447 --> 01:13:32,198
- 安琪在哪？
- 在臥室裏　
- Where's Audrey? - In the bedroom.

670
01:13:32,366 --> 01:13:35,159
- 快哭死了，就是因為你
- 我？　　　　　　　　
- Crying her eyes out because of you. - Me?

671
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:36,661
我做什麼了？
What did I do?

672
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:39,497
你教她要不擇手段向上爬的
All that "You gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with.

673
01:13:39,665 --> 01:13:42,667
- 這也算啊　　　　
- 你快點進去安慰她
- Get out of here! - Go in there and talk to her right now.

674
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:45,044
這個我也不拿手啊，借過
Is it being with you? Excuse me.

675
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:47,255
和一些報告相反
Contrary to some frivolous reporting...

676
01:13:47,673 --> 01:13:51,676
沒有什麼可使我們相信
...we have absolutely no information whatsoever to make us believe...

677
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:54,804
城中有怪獸下的蛋
...that there are any eggs of the creature in the city.

678
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:59,559
大家不需要恐慌，重複，大家不需要恐慌
There's no need for panic. Repeat, there's no reason to panic.

679
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,771
都是我的錯
It's all my fault.

680
01:14:04,648 --> 01:14:08,192
我做了什麼，禽獸？我怎麼會變成這樣？
What have I done, Animal? What have I become?

681
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:12,071
看看，這不是我，我做不出這種事的
Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do stuff like this.

682
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,615
你犯了錯，每個人都會犯錯
You made a mistake. All right? It happens.

683
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:16,868
是的，可是…
Yeah, well...

684
01:14:17,035 --> 01:14:21,038
我令唯一會關心我的人失望
...I just totally screwed up with the only man who will ever care about me.

685
01:14:21,206 --> 01:14:23,875
那你想做些什麼來補償嗎？
If I told you you could make it all up to him, would you?

686
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,543
我當然想
Of course I would.

687
01:14:25,711 --> 01:14:31,382
他在街上離開你後，我就跟著他
Get this. After he left you in the street, I kind of followed him.

688
01:14:31,550 --> 01:14:34,093
我想和他說清楚
I figured I'd talk some sense into the guy.

689
01:14:34,261 --> 01:14:36,596
借過他卻被帶進一間倉庫
Next thing I know, he pulls into this warehouse...

690
01:14:36,763 --> 01:14:39,891
裏面全是穿軍裝的法國鄉巴佬
...with all these French wackos in military outfits.

691
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,727
他們要溜進城裏
They wanna try to sneak back into the city tonight.

692
01:14:43,604 --> 01:14:45,605
他們要去找怪獸的巢穴
They're going after the nest.

693
01:14:45,814 --> 01:14:49,484
如果他們找到了，你能讓全世界明白…
If he finds it, I think you should be the one to let the whole world know...

694
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:51,194
他一直是對的
...that he was right all along.

695
01:14:52,070 --> 01:14:54,280
你想我跟蹤他？
You want me to follow him into the city?

696
01:14:54,740 --> 01:14:57,450
對，我們倆
Yeah, we both will.

697
01:14:57,618 --> 01:15:02,997
- 來吧，會很好玩的　　
- 不，我已經搞得一團糟
- Come on, it'll be fun, it'll be fun. - I already made a mess of everything.

698
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:04,999
是啊，那更需要你去做了，安琪
Yeah, you really did, Audrey.

699
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,586
聽著，我會跟蹤他，跟不跟我走，隨你的便
Listen, I'm going after him. You can go with me, or not. Okay?

700
01:15:12,424 --> 01:15:17,762
- 你在幹什麼？
- 盧西要傷害我
- What are you doing? - Can't let Lucy know. She'll hurt me.

701
01:15:36,365 --> 01:15:37,823
吃口香糖幹什麼？
What's with the chewing gum?

702
01:15:38,784 --> 01:15:41,244
這樣更像美國人
It makes us look more American.

703
01:15:41,411 --> 01:15:42,995
哦，真的嗎？
Oh, really?

704
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,460
讓我來說話，行嗎？
Just let me do all the talking. All right?

705
01:15:53,632 --> 01:15:55,633
沒掛上擋
It's not in gear.

706
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:07,687
跟著我，這邊走
Follow me. This way.

707
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:13,859
- 你沒事吧？
- 沒事　　　
- Are you okay? - I'm okay.

708
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:24,495
來吧
Come on.

709
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:26,163
這是什麼地方？
What is this place?

710
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:29,375
這是地鐵隧道的通風口
It's a vent that leads down to the subway tunnels underneath.

711
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:32,837
直通第二十三街地鐵站
It should take us right to the 23rd Street station in Manhattan.

712
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:39,010
你在開玩笑吧，那兒有老鼠嗎？
You gotta be kidding me. Aren't there rats and stuff down here?

713
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:45,349
我更注意蜥蜴，又大又醜又討厭的蜥蜴
I'm more concerned about lizards. Big, ugly, nasty, large lizards.

714
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:04,994
你們隸屬哪個部隊？
Who are you boys with?

715
01:17:06,747 --> 01:17:10,708
- 我們隸屬三十二部隊，長官
- 我沒問你，小兵　　　　　
- We're with the 3-2, sir. - I didn't ask you, soldier.

716
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:13,836
上士歐尼爾剛剛呼叫我們
Well, Sergeant O'Neal just called down for us.

717
01:17:14,004 --> 01:17:16,589
他想讓我們歸隊，謝謝
He wants us to join him right now. Sir. Thank you.

718
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:23,471
- 你說話有困難嗎？　
- 沒有，長官，我很好
- Have you got a problem talking? - Why, no, sir. I'm fine.

719
01:17:25,223 --> 01:17:26,724
來吧，我們走！
Come on, let's go!

720
01:17:27,643 --> 01:17:31,687
- 好的，繼續前進
- 非常感謝　　　
- All right. Keep it moving. - Thank you very much.

721
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:41,572
埃爾維斯·泊斯裏電影，他是最棒的
Elvis Presley movies. He was the king.

722
01:17:46,912 --> 01:17:50,748
- 長官，歐尼爾的電話
- 歐尼爾，你收到嗎？
- Sir, O'Neal on the line. - O'Neal, do you read me?

723
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:57,588
- 收到　　　
- 情況如何？
- O'Neal. - How are we doing?

724
01:17:57,756 --> 01:18:01,592
情況很好，一切按計劃進行
So far, so good. We're right on schedule.

725
01:18:02,427 --> 01:18:06,347
情況很好，情況很…好
We're good. We're... We're good.

726
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,406
- 噢，天啊
- 好啊　　
- Oh, my God! - Yeah.

727
01:18:23,740 --> 01:18:26,450
他們在那裏，關掉燈，關掉燈
There they are. Kill your light. Kill your light.

728
01:18:28,829 --> 01:18:31,455
快點，我們怎麼下去？快追不上他們了
Come on, how do we get down there? We're gonna lose them.

729
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:43,426
- 他們怎樣下去的？
- 我不知道　　　　
- How did they get down there? - I don't know.

730
01:18:45,345 --> 01:18:47,805
你認為他們是順這爬下的嗎？
You don't think they climbed down this thing?

731
01:18:47,973 --> 01:18:49,473
哦，天哪
Oh, Jesus!

732
01:19:06,199 --> 01:19:08,075
小心
Careful.

733
01:19:13,874 --> 01:19:15,875
- 拉我一把
- 好的　　
- Give me your hand. - I got you.

734
01:19:27,721 --> 01:19:30,306
- 你聽見嗎？
- 什麼？　　
- Do you hear that? - What?

735
01:20:13,433 --> 01:20:15,434
它來了，快走！
Animal, come on!

736
01:20:55,767 --> 01:20:58,185
我想應該是這邊
I guess we go this way.

737
01:21:16,663 --> 01:21:20,583
我們將它定位在第五區
We've spotted him in section five.

738
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:23,752
進入作戰狀態，我們上！
Combat positions. Here we go!

739
01:21:28,466 --> 01:21:31,468
目標北上第五區
Target's heading north to section five.

740
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:36,974
等它進入公園才開火
Do not fire until he has cleared the buildings and enters the park!

741
01:21:40,550 --> 01:21:44,320
2號魚堆 中央公園

742
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:05,312
等它進入公園
Wait until he enters the park.

743
01:23:20,578 --> 01:23:22,204
來吧
Come on.

744
01:23:28,169 --> 01:23:31,714
它要走了，該死的，開火！自由開火！
He's leaving! Damn it! Fire! Fire at will!

745
01:23:39,347 --> 01:23:40,514
媽的！
Damn!

746
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,652
開火！
Fire!

747
01:23:59,034 --> 01:24:00,617
做躲避動作！
Fly to evasive maneuvers.

748
01:24:08,585 --> 01:24:11,962
目標逃向西部高速公路
The target is in the clear and headed towards the West Side Highway.

749
01:24:30,315 --> 01:24:33,442
別擔心，海軍正在那裏等它
Don't worry. The Navy has a little something there waiting for him.

750
01:24:40,158 --> 01:24:44,703
- 全體準備戰鬥
- 進入指定區域
- All stations manned for battle. - At ordered depth, sir.

751
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:46,789
好，聲納探測到它，猶他號駛近
We have him on sonar. Utah closing in.

752
01:24:46,956 --> 01:24:48,832
做好最後準備，準備開火
Make final preparations, prepare to fire.

753
01:24:57,509 --> 01:25:01,011
- 是，是，準備就位
- 魚雷準備就位　　
- Aye, aye, manned and ready. - Torpedo room manned and ready.

阿科瑞基號完了，長官

很香的味道

01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:22,225
我們的炸藥不夠
We don't have enough explosives.

792
01:31:23,258 --> 01:31:24,225
該死

793
01:31:30,318 --> 01:31:32,819
他們在幹什麼？
What the hell are they doing?

794
01:32:07,647 --> 01:32:10,732
尼克，我們有麻煩
Nick, we have a problem.

795
01:32:47,019 --> 01:32:49,729
哦，我的天，我的天！

One second, all right? One second. This is unbelievable.

798
01:33:09,292 --> 01:33:11,459
還拍不夠嗎？
Don't you think we have enough already?

799
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:13,169
我只想…
I just want...

800
01:33:17,842 --> 01:33:21,177
好的，不錯，已經足夠了
Yeah, that's good for me. That's plenty.

…騷擾它們
...startle it.

804
01:33:47,079 --> 01:33:49,372
我們聞起來像魚

Lock the doors now! We have to keep them contained inside. Let's go!

810
01:35:58,002 --> 01:35:59,043
三！
Three!

811
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:13,892
這是尼克隊洗澡的地方
This is where the Knicks get showered and everything.

812
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:23,401
很好，現在怎麼辦？
Great. Now what do we do?

813
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:28,823
我們在林肯地鐵隧道的新澤西出口外面
I'm standing just outside the Jersey entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel.

814
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:33,703
成千的憤怒的難民要求回到市區
Thousands of angry refugees are demanding to be let back into the city.

815
01:36:33,871 --> 01:36:36,956
所有通向市區的道路都堵塞了
All major arteries into the city are clogged with Manhattanites...

816
01:36:37,124 --> 01:36:38,875
為打敗哥斯拉而慶祝的人們
...who are jubilant that Godzilla...

817
01:36:39,043 --> 01:36:40,919
是的，是的，我知道
Yes, yes, I understand.

818

- 許多電話打進你的辦公室找你
- 我知道　　　　　　　　　　
- Your office is swamped with calls. - I know, I know!

819
01:36:44,673 --> 01:36:46,883
你知道這裏發生了什麼麼？
Do you have any idea what's going on out there?

820
01:36:47,051 --> 01:36:50,386
電話快打爆了，市民強烈要求回家
Phones are ringing off the hook. People are screaming to be let back in.

821
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:52,722
潛水員在尋找屍體
We're sending divers into the river for the body.

822
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:54,766
那東西已經死了，你還在等什麼？
That thing's dead. What are you waiting for?

823
01:36:54,934 --> 01:36:58,436
上校，上校，我們要找到巢穴
Colonel. Colonel, we've gotta start a search for the nest.

824
01:36:58,646 --> 01:37:00,355
愛絲，我們已經討論過這事
We've been through this already.

825
01:37:00,523 --> 01:37:03,066
如果尼克對了會怎樣？
What if Nick is right, and we blow this whole thing?

826
01:37:03,234 --> 01:37:06,194
這是我們最後的機會
This could be the only chance we have to do something about it.

827
01:37:10,032 --> 01:37:12,075
上尉，組織一個搜查小組

我要搜查全城和地鐵
I want a complete sweep of the entire city and the subway.

829
01:37:15,454 --> 01:37:17,580
你沒有權力那樣做
You don't have the authority to do that.

830
01:37:17,873 --> 01:37:19,791
你試試來阻攔我
Try and stop me.

831
01:37:32,304 --> 01:37:36,891
叫軍方派轟炸機來炸毀這大廈
Contact the military. Get them to send a bomber to blow up this building.

832
01:37:37,059 --> 01:37:41,312
- 怎樣聯絡他們？ - 555-7600
- How do I do that? - 555-7600.

833
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:44,899
告訴他們暗號是蜻蜓，那就會允許你通話
Tell them it's a Code Dragonfly. That should get you through.

834
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:49,821

838
01:38:13,512 --> 01:38:14,846
他們說什麼
What did they say?

839
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:18,975
打不通，我不知道怎麼回事
I can't get through. I don't know what's wrong.

840
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:23,563
上層的門已被鎖上
We secured the doors on the upper levels.

841
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,940
　　　　　　　　　　　　
瓊·費利普和瓊·皮爾呢？
Where are Jean-Philippe and Jean-Pierre?

842
01:38:26,108 --> 01:38:27,317
他們沒跑掉
They didn't make it.

843
01:38:29,987 --> 01:38:34,741
尼克，我們在這兒擋住它們，你去呼救
Nick, my men and I will hold them here. You'll have to go and get help.

844
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:55,929
你認為我們能上去嗎？
You think we could fit up in there?

845
01:38:58,349 --> 01:39:00,975
只有這個辦法
There's one way to find out.

846
01:39:01,685 --> 01:39:05,021
推我上去，推我上去
Boost me up. Boost me up.

847
01:41:15,944 --> 01:41:20,073
大事不好，大事不好
This is not good. This is not good.

848
01:41:32,169 --> 01:41:33,169
快點，快點
Come on, come on.

849

快點
Come on.

01:42:08,872 --> 01:42:10,456
這層不行
Wrong floor.

851
01:42:19,383 --> 01:42:21,717
我們為什麼不走這邊？
Why don't we go this way?

852

- It's me. It's me. - What happened?

它們衝出來了，到處都是，我出不去
They're loose. They're all over the place. I couldn't get out.

沒人能出去了
No one can get out.

855

哦，好的，非常好
Yeah, all right. Very good.

Do you have a radio or walkie-talkie? Anything to contact the outside?

861
01:43:16,607 --> 01:43:20,026

我都快成功了
I was just about to get it.

The network's on an intranet. It's a direct feed to our computer system.

873
01:44:28,637 --> 01:44:32,014

Your station won't have any easier time reaching the military than I did.

874
01:44:32,182 --> 01:44:35,184
你是說我們所有的電視節目他們都能看到？
When you worked with them, did they monitor all news broadcasts?

875
01:44:35,394 --> 01:44:37,186

Let's not forget in our rush to return to the city...

879
01:45:00,961 --> 01:45:03,587
許多人因此改變了一生

人人都受到震撼…

883
01:45:15,809 --> 01:45:18,060
今晚沒有球賽
There's no Ranger game on tonight.

884
01:45:21,565 --> 01:45:26,235
埃德，如果你看到這個，請替我們直播，情況緊急！
Ed, if you're seeing this, will you please put us on live? It's urgent!

885
01:45:26,903 --> 01:45:29,613
我知道這不合規矩，埃德，但必須這樣
I know this sounds crazy, Ed, but you have to do it.

886
01:45:31,908 --> 01:45:35,953
- 請相信我　　　　
- 我才不會讓你直播
- Please, just trust me. - I'm not putting you on live.

887
01:45:36,121 --> 01:45:38,998
- 我不認為他會幹
- 他會的　　　　
- I don't think he's gonna do it. - Yes, he will.

888
01:45:39,875 --> 01:45:42,376
好吧，埃德，看看
All right, Ed? Come on.

889
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:49,467
看到了麼，埃德，如果不阻止它們，它們會踏平城市
See that, Ed? They're gonna be all over the city if we don't stop them.

890
01:45:50,844 --> 01:45:52,428
等我一下
Give me a second, will you?

891
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:02,188
- 是回家的時候了
- 準備好潛水艇　
- Finally it's time to return home. - Get the diving boats ready.

892
01:46:03,273 --> 01:46:05,316
我們的恐慌逐漸消退…
Our fears have been allayed...

893
01:46:05,484 --> 01:46:08,778
…感謝我們軍隊中的英雄們
...thanks to the heroic efforts of our boys in uniform.

894
01:46:09,446 --> 01:46:10,613
播出了嗎？
Are we on?

895
01:46:13,367 --> 01:46:15,242
- 是的，播出了，你在上面
- 已經播出了？　　　　　
- Yeah, good, you're on. - Are we live?

896
01:46:15,410 --> 01:46:17,370
是的，是的，已經播出了，開始
Yes, yes. You're on. Go!

897
01:46:18,121 --> 01:46:20,289
我們在麥迪遜廣場花園內部進行直播…
We're live inside Madison Square Garden...

898
01:46:20,457 --> 01:46:23,876
在這裏泰托·帕利斯博士發現了怪獸的巢穴
...where Niko Dr. Tatopoulos has discovered the beast's lair.

899
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:26,545
博士，請告訴我們這裏發生了什麼
Doctor, can you please tell us what's happening here?

900
01:46:28,965 --> 01:46:31,634
- 到你了，是的，上，上
- 謝謝　　　　　　　　
- That's you. Yes, go, go. - Thank you.

901
01:46:31,802 --> 01:46:35,721
哦，是的，我們發現了200多個蛋…
Yeah, well, we've discovered over 200 eggs...

902
01:46:35,889 --> 01:46:37,681
去找希克！找希克！
Go get Hicks. Get Hicks!

903
01:46:37,849 --> 01:46:40,643
它們剛剛從蛋殼中孵化而出
...which, a few moments ago, began hatching.

904
01:46:41,728 --> 01:46:45,689
儘管剛孵出，它們卻有九英尺高
The creatures, though just hatched, are over 9 feet tall...

905
01:46:45,857 --> 01:46:48,150
並且它們已開始進食
...and they've begun feeding.

906
01:46:49,986 --> 01:46:52,405
如果這裏存儲的食物吃完了…
When their food supply runs out here...

907
01:46:52,572 --> 01:46:56,992
…它們就會走出巢穴出去找食物
...they will attempt to hunt down food of their own outside of this nest.

908
01:46:57,160 --> 01:46:58,994
哦，我的天哪
Oh, my God.

909
01:46:59,162 --> 01:47:03,332
如果它們能出去，就會大量繁殖，一個新物種就產生了
If they get out, they'll multiply, and very soon a new species will emerge.

910
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:08,337
一個可以取代我們人類的物種
One that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet.

911
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:13,092
這些兩棲類動物出生時就懷孕了
Each one of these amazing reptiles are born pregnant.

912
01:47:13,260 --> 01:47:19,598
200個一年就會變成40000個
Adaptive and cunning, these 200 could become 40,000 within this year.

913
01:47:19,766 --> 01:47:22,143
如軍方聽見這消息…
If the military is listening to this broadcast...

914
01:47:22,310 --> 01:47:24,979
…應立即摧毀這座大廈…
...they have to destroy this building immediately...

915
01:47:25,147 --> 01:47:26,981
…不能讓這些生物逃走
...before these creatures can escape.

916
01:47:33,321 --> 01:47:35,990
目前為止，它們現在困在這建築裏…
So far, they're all trapped inside this building...

917
01:47:36,158 --> 01:47:38,868
..但我們不能支撐很久
...but I don't think we can contain them for long.

918
01:47:39,035 --> 01:47:44,373
它們很強壯，靈巧，正在找食物
They're very strong, they're agile, and they're looking for food.

919
01:47:44,541 --> 01:47:46,876
這樣一來，你的怪獸孵化理論…
So I guess your theory of the creature nesting...

920
01:47:47,043 --> 01:47:49,253
…最終被證明是對的
...turned out to be correct after all.

921
01:47:51,339 --> 01:47:54,884
不管我們會怎樣，最重要的是…
Regardless of what happens to us, the most important thing...

922
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:57,428
…必須在它們逃出之前…
...is that this building be destroyed immediately...

923
01:47:57,596 --> 01:47:59,305
…摧毀這座樓
...before they can escape into the city.

924
01:47:59,473 --> 01:48:01,724
曼迪遜廣場花園現場報導…

929
01:48:27,250 --> 01:48:30,252
我命令你摧毀曼迪遜廣場花園
I want you to blow up Madison Square Garden.

930
01:48:32,960 --> 01:48:36,830
你們成功了，軍方說給你們六分鐘逃出

931
01:48:38,136 --> 01:48:40,304
好的，好消息是他們收到消息了
Well, the good news is they got that message.

932
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:44,558
壞消息是我們必須在六分鐘內逃出去
The bad news is we've got less than six minutes to get out of the building.

933
01:48:44,726 --> 01:48:47,645
好吧，晚會結束了，該跑了
Okay, the party's over. Time to leave.

934
01:49:02,661 --> 01:49:05,496

他們吃完了所有的魚
They've eaten all the fish.

942
01:49:46,037 --> 01:49:47,871
快，尼克,這邊

How much time do we have left?

- Less than 30 seconds. - Oh, God!

950

你很吃驚吧

我會習慣的
I'd like to find out.

百老匯！走百老匯街！

977
01:56:39,075 --> 01:56:43,120
好的，我們沿百老匯街走…

So we can get a clear shot at him. Over.

1004
01:59:59,984 --> 02:00:02,485

No problem. Want us to wash him up for you too?

1005
02:00:06,532 --> 02:00:08,325
最近的大橋在哪裏？

哦，天哪！

1015
02:01:16,185 --> 02:01:18,728
開玩笑吧？我們在它嘴裏！

1023
02:02:50,488 --> 02:02:52,197
它被橋樑懸索纏住了
He's caught in the suspension cables.

1024
02:02:52,365 --> 02:02:54,407

好吧，飛回去再次發射！
Well, circle around and fire again!

1030
02:06:12,314 --> 02:06:16,192
那是我的丈夫！那是我的丈夫！

等等，我們可以利用這個機會
Wait. We can use this.

1034

02:08:46,468 --> 02:08:48,845
就是個保險員
