1
00:00:31,998 --> 00:00:33,965
No! I can't concentrate.

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,504
Please, maestro, i'm sorry,
but I can't carry on like this.

3
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:40,140
Let's take it from number 37.

4
00:01:09,169 --> 00:01:11,538
Oh, my god! No, no!

5
00:01:12,038 --> 00:01:15,542
Maestro, please let's take it
from

6
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,660
Stop! Stop!

7
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:38,815
I can't stand it anymore!

8
00:01:39,315 --> 00:01:43,785
It's ridiculous. Poor
thing. Are you hurt?

9
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:47,323
It's ridiculous! This
is Macbeth by Giuseppe Verdi!

10
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,342
I've never seen
such lousy direction.

11
00:01:49,377 --> 00:01:51,292
We have a problem?
Yes, you!

12
00:01:51,327 --> 00:01:56,332
This isn't one of your crummy movies! Birds
on stage, back projection, laser beams!

13
00:01:56,367 --> 00:01:59,300
What is this?
An opera or amusement park?

14
00:01:59,335 --> 00:02:03,339
I have to sing! How can I do that
with a raven on stage that hates me?

15
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,807
I can't imagine why
it should hate you, Mara.

16
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:09,846
Neither can i! But it never
takes its beady eyes off me.

17
00:02:09,881 --> 00:02:11,848
It shrieks, whistles,
flaps its wings.

18
00:02:12,348 --> 00:02:16,317
It's deliberately destroying my
performance! It's just a bird.

19
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:19,856
Yes, and birds should be with other
birds and not in the opera singingmacbeth!

20
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:22,609
Where is my manager?

21
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,994
I'm here, Mara.
I am going back to the hotel.

22
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:27,212
Come on, Mara.
Please, don't be like this.

23
00:02:27,247 --> 00:02:29,714
I'll rest till 7:00. I shall
be ready to sing at 8:00.

24
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:34,254
Ready to sing, without ravens or
any other nonsense. A real opera!

25
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:36,471
What do we do now?

26
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:38,473
Oh, carry on
with the rehearsal.

27
00:02:38,508 --> 00:02:42,512
If something like this happens
again, i'll take my ravens and leave.

28
00:02:42,547 --> 00:02:44,781
Okay. Maestro?
Please, please.

29
00:02:44,816 --> 00:02:47,016
We'll take it
from the

30
00:02:56,776 --> 00:03:00,280
Thanks to you and your so-called
brilliant and original direction!

31
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:04,033
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great Mara Giacova...

32
00:03:04,068 --> 00:03:07,036
Has been knocked down
by a car!

33
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,656
Is she badly hurt?
Call an ambulance. Hurry!

34
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:14,160
What a disaster!
What are we gonna do?

35
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:53,533
Hello?
Is that you, betty?

36
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:57,537
Yes. Tonight you make
your debut as Lady Macbeth.

37
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:00,039
What?
Are you happy?

38
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:02,542
Who's speaking?

39
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:07,046
Is this a joke?

40
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:09,316
Hello?

41
00:04:09,351 --> 00:04:11,551
Hello?

42
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:01,699
Mira!

43
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:04,737
Come on, betty, come on.
Get ready.

44
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:07,740
In exactly one hour,
you've got to be on stage.

45
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:11,209
Mara Giacova has had
an accident. Here.

46
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:14,212
Someone already called.
I thought it was a joke.

47
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:17,750
Why are you crying? Are you
scared of making your debut?

48
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:22,255
No! But Lady Macbeth. I'm too
young. My voice isn't right.

49
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:25,223
You'll be a smash hit.

50
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,725
I'm afraid I won't reach
some of the notes.

51
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,763
Trust me. I'm not only
your agent, i'm your friend.

52
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:34,267
I know what you're going through.
Just opening-night nerves.

53
00:05:34,302 --> 00:05:37,788
Don't let them show.
They're all coming to see you.

54
00:05:37,823 --> 00:05:41,274
Don't show them how
"inconfident" you are, okay?

55
00:05:41,309 --> 00:05:43,241
Stop!

56
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:45,743
Well, my dear Betty,
are we ready?

57
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:50,033
Mara's unfortunate accident is going
to speed you towards your destiny.

58
00:05:50,068 --> 00:05:52,535
Tonight you will make
your debut in Verdi's Macbeth.

59
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,003
Do I see tears?

60
00:05:55,038 --> 00:05:57,005
Tears of happiness, I hope.

61
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,043
Don't tell me you're afraid.
Afraid you'll fail?

62
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:02,010
I'm too young
for the role.

63
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:05,298
Verdi's first Lady Macbeth
was only 17.

64
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,551
Anyway, you know the opera by heart.

65
00:06:09,052 --> 00:06:13,056
I watched you at all rehearsals
working so hard preparing yourself...

66
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:16,059
As though you were the star
and not the understudy.

67
00:06:18,561 --> 00:06:22,565
Don't worry about the orchestra. They'll
only need half an hour's rehearsal. Excellent.

68
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,568
Come on. Stop it!
This is your big chance.

69
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:28,036
I know.

70
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:31,074
Think of your mother, how happy
and proud she would have been...

71
00:06:31,109 --> 00:06:33,541
To see you in a great opera
following her career.

72
00:06:33,576 --> 00:06:38,197
If people like you, next you'll
sing in New York and Salzburg.

73
00:06:38,448 --> 00:06:40,915
What happened to Mara?

74
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,918
She got hit by a car,
or so I heard.

75
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:47,457
Ah, you are listening to
Prokofsky's recording of Macbeth.

76
00:06:47,957 --> 00:06:49,959
Did you know it was
a production of ours?

77
00:06:49,994 --> 00:06:52,462
1975.

78
00:06:52,962 --> 00:06:55,465
It's the opera.
Macbeth brings bad luck.

79
00:06:55,965 --> 00:07:00,935
What are you talking about? Everyone
says it. Macbeth brings bad luck.

80
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:04,974
It's a great opera, but I would much
rather make my debut in something else.

81
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,976
Don't let Patini hear
you say that. It's true!

82
00:07:07,477 --> 00:07:09,979
Shut up! So you think this
opera brings bad luck, hmm?

83
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,482
I don't know.
It's what everyone says.

84
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,949
Well,
i don't say it.

85
00:07:14,984 --> 00:07:18,488
Look, you have a wonderful
voice, you are very beautiful,

86
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:22,492
And you're making your debut
in a great theater.

87
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:25,960
You must make the most
of this opportunity.

88
00:07:25,995 --> 00:07:28,998
It usually only happens to
people in the movies, huh?

89
00:07:29,033 --> 00:07:33,002
Mm-hmm.
Don't throw it away.

90
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:38,007
Yes.

91
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:22,028
Five, four, three, two, one,
now!

92
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,535
Let her through,
let her through!

93
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,793
There's too much smoke.

94
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:40,046
There's too much smoke!

95
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,647
Dino, cut the smoke.
Cut the smoke!

96
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:45,266
Wait a second. No! The scar
should be on the other side!

97
00:09:45,301 --> 00:09:49,055
Betty goes on in another two
minutes. Okay, two minutes for Betty.

98
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:55,026
Two minutes, two.

99
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:57,063
Oh, what are you doing?
Leave it!

100
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,065
Leave it!
Put it in the center.

101
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:04,570
Oh, no, no!
Stop it!

102
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:08,074
That's okay.
Just go away.

103
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,652
Be careful! Be careful
not to ruin the costume.

104
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:03,048
You've finally returned.

105
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:59,320
What are you doing here?
You're not allowed in here.

106
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:03,609
This box is for stage personnel
only. Come on. Let's go.

107
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:18,874
What the hell do you-

108
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:36,607
Stay where you are.
Betty?

109
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:39,610
- Keep your positions.
- Keep going.

110
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:43,148
It was an accident.
Nothing more. Okay?

111
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,652
Give it here.

112
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:51,657
Okay, maestro.

113
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:01,987
Well done, Betty!
You're so beautiful!

114
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:12,998
That's enough, Mara!
Don't be childish.

115
00:17:13,033 --> 00:17:16,769
You're a star!
You really think so?

116
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:20,471
Bravo. You're wonderful! Wonderful!

117
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:24,510
Betty, my sincerest compliments.
You were sensational.

118
00:17:24,545 --> 00:17:27,478
Thank you.

119
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:31,517
There'll be a first-night
party later on. Thank you.

120
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:35,521
Betty, you were magnificent.
Thank you, maestro.

121
00:17:35,556 --> 00:17:38,524
Will you be at the reception? Yes.

122
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,026
Marc,
the press are here.

123
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,529
What about the accident
with the lights?

124
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:47,282
The shouting and the screaming!
What shouting and screaming?

125
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,536
You didn't hear it? It came
from one of the boxes. No.

126
00:17:50,571 --> 00:17:53,038
Betty?
Oh, Marc!

127
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:57,543
Marc, wasn't she great?

128
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:04,049
I know we've had some trouble, but
it's got nothing to do with Macbeth.

129
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:07,052
The only bad luck Macbeth
has brought you is fame.

130
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:10,055
I know.
My mother was a singer.

131
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:15,060
You better run along.
People will be waiting for you.

132
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,569
Fantastic!

133
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:35,581
I mean it! Betty, you were
fantastic! You were great!

134
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:38,048
I just love Verdi's music.
I really do!

135
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:41,051
Oh, god, you were wonderful.
Just wonderful.

136
00:18:41,086 --> 00:18:46,225
Just that damn, damn director!
I can't take him anymore.

137
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,199
Giulia?

138
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,236
You work here
in the theater?

139
00:18:57,271 --> 00:19:00,739
Ah, no.
Excuse me.

140
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,245
Ahh, you're a fan of mine. Yes.

141
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:08,497
The first.
First what?

142
00:19:08,532 --> 00:19:10,214
Congratulations.
Fan.

143
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:12,716
You were wonderful.
Thank you.

144
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,255
Do you want an autograph? Oh, yeah.

145
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,259
I'd like that.
Thank you.

146
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:23,227
Excuse me.

147
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,264
What name shall i-
Excuse me.

148
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:26,730
Alan.

149
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:29,268
Alan?
Mm-Hmm.

150
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,237
Thank you.

151
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,739
Are you a foreigner?
Oh, no.

152
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,777
Everything is ready, inspector,
and they're all waiting for you.

153
00:19:38,812 --> 00:19:41,780
Okay. So you are a policeman, not a fan.

154
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,284
Can't a policeman be a fan? It's just-

155
00:19:45,784 --> 00:19:49,288
I'm not an expert on opera,
but...

156
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,790
Your voice is-

157
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,294
Thanks for the autograph.

158
00:19:59,047 --> 00:20:01,550
Yes?

159
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,803
Hi. What did the cop want? Hi.

160
00:20:04,838 --> 00:20:07,556
My autograph.
Why is he here?

161
00:20:08,056 --> 00:20:10,023
Who knows?

162
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:13,562
Oh, maybe because of the accident with
the lights. One of the stagehands died.

163
00:20:13,929 --> 00:20:15,896
What?
Yeah, it's pretty weird.

164
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:20,901
Leave your costume there. Marc
says it needs a few alterations.

165
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:24,439
Listen. I don't want to go to the party
alone. Would you feel like taking me?

166
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,406
Please?
Sure, i'd love to!

167
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,909
I almost forgot.
You were great tonight.

168
00:20:28,944 --> 00:20:31,912
And it looks like i'm the
last one to congratulate you.

169
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:36,451
So you think it would be okay if I had a
kiss? Even if i'm only the stage manager?

170
00:20:36,486 --> 00:20:39,454
What do you say?

171
00:20:44,459 --> 00:20:46,927
Did you really like me?
Really?

172
00:20:46,962 --> 00:20:49,930
Like you? I loved you!

173
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:53,468
From the great Mara Giacova.

174
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:57,472
With her best wishes.
Thank you.

175
00:20:59,975 --> 00:21:02,978
Hmm.

176
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:07,866
The great Mara Giacova can say she was
literally struck by the curse of Macbeth.

177
00:21:11,486 --> 00:21:13,989
"Good luck, little snake."

178
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:17,492
Ooh, you can certainly feel
her sting there!

179
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,628
Looks expensive.

180
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:25,500
Ohh!

181
00:21:25,751 --> 00:21:28,253
Whew!

182
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:32,758
What do you think
it is?

183
00:21:33,258 --> 00:21:35,260
Who knows?

184
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,227
Frog slime?

185
00:21:37,262 --> 00:21:40,265
Acid?
Poison?

186
00:21:50,776 --> 00:21:53,278
Hey, what's wrong?
What's wrong?

187
00:21:57,783 --> 00:21:59,284
You idiot!

188
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:05,791
Yuck! Ginseng! Giacova
would bathe in that stuff!

189
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:56,474
Filthy damn birds!

190
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:31,725
I'm sorry, I can't.
It's not your fault.

191
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:35,228
I'm a disaster in bed.
I don't know why. I'm sorry.

192
00:28:35,263 --> 00:28:39,232
According to the legend, opera
singers are incredibly horny.

193
00:28:39,267 --> 00:28:43,772
You know, really. They say they make
love before they go out on stage.

194
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:47,776
That way it sort of...
relaxes their voice.

195
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,778
You know,
sweetens it up a little.

196
00:28:50,278 --> 00:28:54,282
Either i'm
a lousy opera singer or-

197
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:56,249
Have I offended you?
No.

198
00:28:56,284 --> 00:29:00,754
Well, I mean...
now that you're famous,

199
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:04,292
It seems like things are a
little bit different between us.

200
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:07,796
No, don't say that.
It's not true.

201
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:15,053
What a place!
It looks like a museum.

202
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:19,307
It sort of is.
I've got a rich uncle.

203
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:24,562
It's his place. He's stinking rich, and
he lets me use it whenever I need it.

204
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:29,067
Want some tea?
Yes, please.

205
00:29:31,069 --> 00:29:34,322
All right, i've got rose,
jasmine,

206
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:36,592
Or mint.
Jasmine.

207
00:29:36,627 --> 00:29:38,827
Jasmine.
Okay.

208
00:29:50,338 --> 00:29:53,341
No! Mint!

209
00:31:05,413 --> 00:31:10,301
Take a good look. If you try to close
your eyes, you'll tear them apart.

210
00:31:10,802 --> 00:31:13,805
So you'll just have
to watch everything.

211
00:31:15,306 --> 00:31:18,309
Betty!

212
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,313
Why did you lock it?
Are you feeling okay?

213
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:25,316
No, no!

214
00:31:37,579 --> 00:31:39,581
What the hell is going on?

215
00:32:45,146 --> 00:32:50,151
It's not true you're frigid.
You're a bitch in heat.

216
00:33:59,921 --> 00:34:03,424
Hello?
There's been a murder.

217
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:06,928
At 66 Viale Pegaso.

218
00:34:08,429 --> 00:34:10,932
Who's speaking?

219
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:44,931
My god! Look what
success has done to you!

220
00:34:44,966 --> 00:34:48,469
Come on. I'm gonna get the
papers. I want to read the reviews.

221
00:34:50,471 --> 00:34:51,973
Well!

222
00:34:55,476 --> 00:34:57,979
Something wrong
with your eyes?

223
00:34:58,014 --> 00:35:00,446
Stage lights?
Yes.

224
00:35:00,481 --> 00:35:02,983
The lights.
What lights?

225
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,451
Okay, it wasn't
the lights.

226
00:35:05,486 --> 00:35:07,488
How do you turn on
the heating?

227
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:10,491
Here, here.
Thanks.

228
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:22,136
- That bad, was it?
- I can't tell you.

229
00:35:23,638 --> 00:35:26,641
It was so-
I can't tell you.

230
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,643
Trouble in love?

231
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:31,145
Love?

232
00:35:31,646 --> 00:35:33,613
What love?

233
00:35:33,648 --> 00:35:38,653
Whenever a woman has a problem,
men always presume it's love.

234
00:35:38,688 --> 00:35:40,620
You sopranos
are famous for-

235
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:43,623
- Whoring around?
- Now, wait a minute-

236
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:48,663
Look, i've already
heard that story tonight.

237
00:35:48,698 --> 00:35:51,130
Some people think
that we make love...

238
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:55,134
Just before going on stage
to improve the voice.

239
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:59,674
Wrong. As far as I am
concerned, anyway, totally wrong.

240
00:35:59,709 --> 00:36:02,176
You mean,
you've never made love?

241
00:36:02,211 --> 00:36:04,178
Of course I have.

242
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:09,684
It's just-
It's never worked.

243
00:36:11,686 --> 00:36:16,155
Anyway, you also work
in movies,

244
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,193
And you movie people are
legendary when it comes to-

245
00:36:19,228 --> 00:36:21,661
That's true.

246
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:24,198
I always jerk off
before I shoot a scene.

247
00:36:27,702 --> 00:36:31,205
Come on. You have to talk
about it sooner or later.

248
00:36:50,758 --> 00:36:54,262
And then I ran away,
and that's when I found you.

249
00:36:57,265 --> 00:37:01,269
The strangest thing
about what happened tonight-

250
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:04,737
All the terrible things
i saw...

251
00:37:04,772 --> 00:37:09,277
Are from a nightmare
i used to have as a child.

252
00:37:11,279 --> 00:37:15,416
I used to dream of a man
wearing a black hood.

253
00:37:16,667 --> 00:37:19,252
Tonight I saw that same hood.

254
00:37:19,287 --> 00:37:21,672
- You said you called the police.
- Yes.

255
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:26,642
Did you give your name? No.

256
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:31,682
Told me everything? About
what happened tonight? Yes.

257
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,185
Why? There's more,
right?

258
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,190
Ah-

259
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,200
I'll check
the other rooms.

260
00:37:59,961 --> 00:38:03,965
- Have you got a boyfriend?
- No.

261
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,969
Someone who might get jealous? No.

262
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:12,340
- Not that I know of. Why?
- There's someone watching your windows with binoculars.

263
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,092
Where?
Come and see.

264
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:20,348
Ah, he's gone.

265
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:23,351
He was there,
under the street lamp.

266
00:38:46,874 --> 00:38:49,842
I could stay
if you want me to.

267
00:38:49,877 --> 00:38:52,880
Don't you have someone
waiting for you?

268
00:38:52,915 --> 00:38:55,348
Yes.

269
00:38:55,383 --> 00:38:59,387
She's probably having a fit
because you're not home yet.

270
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:02,890
I'll lock myself in.
Don't worry.

271
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,608
Make sure
you lock all the windows.

272
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:10,648
I'll look around in the street. If i
see anything suspicious, i'll phone you.

273
00:39:10,683 --> 00:39:14,151
If not,
see you tomorrow.

274
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,655
What is it?

275
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,160
There is someone
out there.

276
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:26,629
A woman and-

277
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:32,169
Who's there? Who are you?
Who do you think I am?

278
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,171
I live here.
I'm one of your neighbors.

279
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,174
Who was that man?
Was he looking for me?

280
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,677
No. It's nothing.

281
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:43,681
I told you, nothing!

282
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,184
Who do you think she is?

283
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,687
A neighbor, like she said.

284
00:40:07,204 --> 00:40:09,206
Put the chain on.
All right.

285
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:12,209
Don't want to lose
another star.

286
00:41:40,681 --> 00:41:43,183
Who is it?

287
00:41:43,218 --> 00:41:45,686
Who's there?

288
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:52,193
Who's there?

289
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,780
Hello?

290
00:41:57,815 --> 00:42:00,317
Is that you, marc?

291
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:04,822
Marc?
Is that you?

292
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:17,084
Oh, my god!
Why did I sing that role?

293
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,838
I shouldn't have.
I shouldn't have!

294
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,343
It was my fault.

295
00:42:29,346 --> 00:42:31,849
Why, why did I do it?

296
00:42:45,496 --> 00:42:48,499
Don't cry, betty. Don't cry.

297
00:42:48,616 --> 00:42:51,083
"Stormy reception
formacbeth."

298
00:42:51,118 --> 00:42:53,586
"Brilliant debut
by a young singer...

299
00:42:53,621 --> 00:42:56,624
Who at the last moment
substituted Mara Giacova."

300
00:42:57,124 --> 00:42:59,126
"Revolutionary
but crazy sets."

301
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:01,128
"Doubts regarding
the direction."

302
00:43:01,629 --> 00:43:05,516
Go back to horror films.
Forget opera."

303
00:43:06,016 --> 00:43:08,519
- Ha!
- Ha. They're pulling you to pieces.

304
00:43:08,554 --> 00:43:11,021
At least
it's only on paper.

305
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:13,489
And she,
a total unknown,

306
00:43:13,524 --> 00:43:16,992
Gets nothing but praise.
Well, she was very good.

307
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:21,532
Last time, when they lauded Cecilia Gasti
and blasted your direction Ofrigoletto,

308
00:43:21,567 --> 00:43:25,035
You were very pissed off,
but not this time.

309
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,503
How come?

310
00:43:27,538 --> 00:43:32,042
You want to take
the girl to bed, don't you?

311
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,510
Listen. To be here with you
this evening,

312
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:39,049
I took two flights and
turned down a fashion show.

313
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:50,978
Fragments of the same feathers
mixed with traces of blood...

314
00:43:51,013 --> 00:43:54,982
Were found on a carpet
in Stefano Brini's apartment.

315
00:43:55,017 --> 00:43:57,449
Ah, who was he?
Your-

316
00:43:57,484 --> 00:44:02,489
Stage manager. Ah, yes. Stage manager.

317
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:06,994
Killed, or rather...
butchered last night,

318
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:09,997
Between 1:00 and 2:00.

319
00:44:11,498 --> 00:44:15,968
Who saw him last?
Hmm?

320
00:44:16,003 --> 00:44:19,006
Well, there was
a first-night party.

321
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:21,473
Oh.
Did he leave alone?

322
00:44:21,508 --> 00:44:24,011
I really don't know.
I wasn't there.

323
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:26,130
I see. Then who did go
to the party?

324
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:29,133
Did you?
Yes, I did.

325
00:44:29,383 --> 00:44:34,888
- What time did he leave?
- I think he left with betty, our singer.

326
00:44:35,389 --> 00:44:37,856
Is betty here?
No, but she will be soon.

327
00:44:37,891 --> 00:44:40,894
We have to rehearse. If there's nothing else
- I'm not finished.

328
00:44:42,896 --> 00:44:45,899
You're mauricio, right? The
one responsible for the ravens.

329
00:44:45,934 --> 00:44:48,902
Yes.
How many were killed?

330
00:44:49,036 --> 00:44:52,039
Three. Inspector, I think i
know who killed the ravens.

331
00:44:52,074 --> 00:44:54,006
Who? Mara Giacova. She hated them.

332
00:44:54,041 --> 00:44:58,545
No, no, no. What are you talking
about? Don't be ridiculous.

333
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:02,631
Ravens are very vindictive.
They don't forget.

334
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:06,420
They remember for years and years,
and at the right moment, zap!

335
00:45:06,455 --> 00:45:10,174
This production of Macbeth has
been hit by so much bad luck...

336
00:45:10,209 --> 00:45:13,945
And so many coincidences,
it staggers the imagination.

337
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,681
I don't want you to think
i'm a superstitious type,

338
00:45:17,716 --> 00:45:20,567
But it's Macbeth
that brings bad luck.

339
00:45:20,602 --> 00:45:22,069
Everyone knows that.

340
00:45:22,569 --> 00:45:25,537
I could tell you about dozens
of strange incidents.

341
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:29,576
A lot of people seriously
believe the opera to be cursed.

342
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:35,833
I've seen a lot of your movies. Yes,
you're really an expert in this field.

343
00:45:35,949 --> 00:45:38,417
I'd be very interested
to know your opinion.

344
00:45:38,452 --> 00:45:42,456
I think it's unwise to use movies as a
guide for reality, don't you, inspector?

345
00:45:42,491 --> 00:45:44,807
Depends what you mean
by reality.

346
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:46,809
Excuse me, but i've got
to fix this dress.

347
00:45:46,844 --> 00:45:50,347
The next performance is the day after
tomorrow, and i've only got two hands.

348
00:45:50,382 --> 00:45:54,351
Even with ten hands, the costumes
would still be a pile of shit.

349
00:45:54,386 --> 00:45:56,819
What?

350
00:45:56,854 --> 00:45:59,321
All right,
mr. genius director!

351
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:01,608
I'd put most of the blame
for what's happening...

352
00:46:01,643 --> 00:46:03,826
On our fancy-pants,
whimsical director here...

353
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:06,980
Who thinks Verdi was a twit
and Shakespeare a total asshole.

354
00:46:07,481 --> 00:46:11,618
I'll fix the dress, all right, but not
for you, mr. director! For Giuseppe Verdi!

355
00:46:11,735 --> 00:46:14,238
Come on, Marion.
Let's get out of here.

356
00:46:19,243 --> 00:46:22,746
All this turns you on, doesn't
it? What are you talking about?

357
00:46:22,781 --> 00:46:25,214
You're a sadist.
Oh, really?

358
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:27,751
Everyone I know who knows
you says the same thing.

359
00:46:28,252 --> 00:46:31,138
That must be very boring
for you.

360
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:56,663
Giulia?

361
00:46:57,164 --> 00:46:59,631
Oh, just the person
i wanted to see.

362
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:02,169
What's happened to my
costume? Look at this mess.

363
00:47:02,286 --> 00:47:05,289
Someone tore it apart.
Who could have done it?

364
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:08,292
Someone who doesn't like the opera,
or that asshole Marc's version of it.

365
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,795
This time our director
OD'd on weird.

366
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,762
It isn't like the movies.

367
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,800
There, when you come up with something
original, everyone congratulates you.

368
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:20,804
Oh! Oh, god!

369
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:23,807
God, what a mess!
Somehow it's gotta be mended.

370
00:47:24,308 --> 00:47:27,060
And since they didn't call in
the dressmaker, it's up to me.

371
00:47:27,095 --> 00:47:29,813
I'm sorry. You'll have to try
it on again once i've finished.

372
00:47:30,314 --> 00:47:32,316
Mm-Hmm.

373
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,821
We're lucky, though. Most of
this junk jewelry's still intact.

374
00:47:37,856 --> 00:47:41,325
Listen, Giulia, i'll be
back in a minute. Okay.

375
00:48:02,846 --> 00:48:04,813
Mira, I must see you.
I'm frantic.

376
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:08,352
Me too. My phone hasn't stopped
ringing. Everybody wants you.

377
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,355
Everybody!
Rome, Vienna, Paris!

378
00:48:11,488 --> 00:48:15,742
That's wonderful, but I have to
talk to you about something else.

379
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:18,996
Something really serious.
There's a maniac who's after me.

380
00:48:19,112 --> 00:48:22,115
I need your advice on what to
do. I'll give it to you now.

381
00:48:22,366 --> 00:48:24,368
Go to the police.
No, I can't.

382
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:27,754
I'm in terrible trouble,
and I don't know what to do.

383
00:48:28,255 --> 00:48:30,257
I must see you.
I must!

384
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:32,626
Yeah, all right.
I'll come by this evening.

385
00:48:32,661 --> 00:48:35,779
Betty, what have you done?

386
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:11,048
Betty?

387
00:49:11,298 --> 00:49:13,800
That you?

388
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,566
Who's there?

389
00:50:07,354 --> 00:50:10,357
'Tis you.
Come here, look. Come.

390
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,574
Hey, look what I found.

391
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:17,114
What about it? It's gold! I never
sewed any real gold on this thing.

392
00:50:17,149 --> 00:50:20,617
It's yours. No, I never saw it before.

393
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:25,122
How did it get on my
costume? Don't know.

394
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:29,376
Maybe whoever ripped up
the dress, dropped it.

395
00:50:29,493 --> 00:50:30,994
Give me that.

396
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:35,132
It looks like
there's a date on it...

397
00:50:35,499 --> 00:50:37,466
And an inscription. A name? Let me see.

398
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:41,505
Oh, the writing's tiny. The
letters are almost faded away.

399
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,509
I've got a magnifying glass
somewhere. I'm sure I have.

400
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:48,011
It should be in-

401
00:50:48,046 --> 00:50:50,013
Damn!

402
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,153
It should be here.

403
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,661
Any luck?
No!

404
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:09,166
Where did I see it?
I'm positive I saw it.

405
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,134
Oh, wait.

406
00:51:12,169 --> 00:51:14,671
It is in here.

407
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:19,176
Oh, where is it?

408
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:26,683
What happened? Betty? I'm
all right. Don't worry.

409
00:51:27,184 --> 00:51:30,687
It's gotta be in here,
because I saw it in a drawer.

410
00:51:37,694 --> 00:51:41,698
Hey, listen, you keep on looking
here. I'll check the ironing room.

411
00:52:06,339 --> 00:52:08,341
I found it!

412
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:15,697
I found it.

413
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,734
You enjoyed it last night,
you whore.

414
00:52:18,235 --> 00:52:20,704
You opera singers
are all whores.

415
00:52:35,368 --> 00:52:37,504
There's a date.

416
00:52:44,377 --> 00:52:47,380
It's an anniversary,
i guess.

417
00:52:52,769 --> 00:52:54,771
Where have you-

418
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,893
Oh, my god!

419
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:28,805
Here.
Is this what you want?

420
00:53:28,840 --> 00:53:31,308
Is this what you want?

421
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:34,811
Here.
Have it!

422
00:53:49,576 --> 00:53:52,078
You bastard!

423
00:54:11,598 --> 00:54:13,600
No, no!

424
00:54:24,945 --> 00:54:27,447
It's, it's-

425
00:56:48,254 --> 00:56:50,256
I'm gonna take you whenever.

426
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:54,127
Whenever I want!

427
00:58:31,474 --> 00:58:33,977
Hi there.
Hi.

428
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:46,372
Let go of me!
Leave me alone!

429
00:58:46,873 --> 00:58:49,375
These marks-
Who did this to you?

430
00:58:51,377 --> 00:58:54,881
Is this another manifestation
of the curse of Macbeth?

431
00:58:54,916 --> 00:58:57,401
Or did it happen
last night?

432
00:58:57,436 --> 00:58:59,886
So it did happen
last night.

433
00:58:59,921 --> 00:59:01,853
Yes!

434
00:59:01,888 --> 00:59:04,390
Why didn't you tell me?

435
00:59:06,893 --> 00:59:09,861
Because...

436
00:59:09,896 --> 00:59:13,900
It was worse than anything
i could ever have imagined.

437
00:59:13,935 --> 00:59:17,904
I just wanted to forget,
cancel it from my mind.

438
00:59:19,906 --> 00:59:21,908
Not see anything.

439
00:59:22,408 --> 00:59:24,410
Not feel anything.

440
00:59:25,411 --> 00:59:28,915
Not think anything! I
just wanted to get away!

441
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,917
I understand
what you're saying.

442
00:59:31,417 --> 00:59:35,386
Listen, i'm here to help you,
not to persecute you.

443
00:59:35,421 --> 00:59:39,425
And I promise, we'll do everything
we can to catch this man,

444
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:42,428
But I need
your collaboration.

445
00:59:46,432 --> 00:59:49,435
I don't know
what he looks like.

446
00:59:52,438 --> 00:59:55,191
He ties me up.

447
00:59:55,226 --> 00:59:57,909
Touches me.

448
00:59:57,944 --> 01:00:03,449
Makes me watch. But he
never lets me see his face.

449
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:11,074
This afternoon...

450
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:15,078
At the theater, he killed
Giulia, the wardrobe mistress.

451
01:00:15,113 --> 01:00:19,547
Christ! I'd better get
over there. No, please!

452
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:23,586
Don't worry. We'll get to the
bottom of this. I'll be back.

453
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:28,091
Don't leave me alone.
I'm afraid.

454
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,559
All right.
Calm down.

455
01:00:31,594 --> 01:00:35,348
Now, go upstairs
and lock yourself in.

456
01:00:35,383 --> 01:00:39,102
Wait for my assistant,
Daniele Soave.

457
01:00:39,137 --> 01:00:41,104
All right.

458
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:47,360
Remember,
Daniele Soave.

459
01:01:08,381 --> 01:01:10,348
Who is it?
This is Daniele Soave.

460
01:01:10,383 --> 01:01:14,387
Did the inspector tell you
that i'd be coming? Yes, he did.

461
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,163
Good evening.
May I come in?

462
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,631
Yes, of course, please.

463
01:01:43,666 --> 01:01:46,669
Don't worry about me. My eyes
hurt, so I put some drops in them.

464
01:01:46,919 --> 01:01:48,921
It's okay if I take
a look around?

465
01:01:49,422 --> 01:01:51,924
Yeah, go ahead.

466
01:01:54,427 --> 01:01:58,431
Just give me a minute,
and i'll be right with you.

467
01:01:58,466 --> 01:02:01,818
Are you nervous?
A little.

468
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,821
No, a lot. Well, i'm here
now, so you can relax.

469
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:08,825
I will. Thank you. I have
a great system for relaxing.

470
01:02:22,088 --> 01:02:25,958
You are feeling very calm.

471
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:28,961
Calm and relaxed.

472
01:02:29,962 --> 01:02:34,967
Concentrate only on the
music. Only on the music.

473
01:02:36,469 --> 01:02:40,473
Breathe deeply.

474
01:02:41,474 --> 01:02:43,601
One,

475
01:02:43,636 --> 01:02:45,693
Two,

476
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:49,232
Three, four.

477
01:02:49,482 --> 01:02:51,984
Did you call, miss?
No.

478
01:02:52,485 --> 01:02:55,438
I'm listening to a tape.
Oh. Well, if you need me.

479
01:03:23,149 --> 01:03:26,903
I'll get it.

480
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,773
You expecting someone?

481
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:34,277
Yes, a friend. Check who it
is before opening the door.

482
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:38,781
Of course,
but I know it's her.

483
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:43,286
Is that you, Mira?

484
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,291
It's her.

485
01:03:52,295 --> 01:03:54,797
I read the papers.
How terrible!

486
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,800
And getting worse.
Keep your voice down.

487
01:03:57,835 --> 01:04:00,303
Is someone here? Yes! Vienna and Paris!

488
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:04,190
Mira, the killer
killed again this afternoon.

489
01:04:04,225 --> 01:04:07,944
Giulia, the wardrobe
mistress. I was there.

490
01:04:08,444 --> 01:04:12,064
Now I understand why the police are
keeping an eye on you. Who told you that?

491
01:04:12,099 --> 01:04:14,567
What? That the police
are keeping an eye on me.

492
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:18,955
The officer downstairs in the hall. He
asked me who I was, where I was going.

493
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,957
His name is... Soave.

494
01:04:21,457 --> 01:04:24,710
Daniele Soave?
Yeah, that's right.

495
01:04:27,713 --> 01:04:29,715
But he's in the living room.

496
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,969
Who's in the living room?
You're not making sense.

497
01:04:33,004 --> 01:04:35,221
Come.

498
01:04:53,739 --> 01:04:57,208
Then who is he, Betty? I don't know.

499
01:04:57,243 --> 01:05:01,747
He could be the maniac!
He's gone. He was in there!

500
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:05,368
Call the police.
The phone's over there.

501
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:08,388
I'm too scared to go in.

502
01:05:08,423 --> 01:05:11,374
He may be hiding.
Wait!

503
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:17,013
Let's get out of here.

504
01:05:21,017 --> 01:05:25,521
Wait. What if this one is real, and
the one downstairs is the maniac?

505
01:05:26,022 --> 01:05:29,525
We'll walk right into him. And
what if it's the other way around?

506
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:32,493
I do not desire to find out either way.

507
01:05:32,528 --> 01:05:36,032
You're right. I didn't
even get a good look at him.

508
01:05:36,067 --> 01:05:38,499
Oh, no!

509
01:05:38,534 --> 01:05:42,538
The kitchen!
It's a heavy door.

510
01:05:47,543 --> 01:05:51,047
The knives!
We can defend ourselves.

511
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,519
I got one.

512
01:05:58,554 --> 01:06:02,058
I'd like to see him
get in here now.

513
01:06:02,093 --> 01:06:04,025
We can always scream.

514
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:07,028
You're a singer. You
could scream the roof off!

515
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:11,567
This building is ancient. The walls are
three feet thick. No one will hear a thing.

516
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:40,096
Yes?

517
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,603
Right.
All right, right away.

518
01:07:27,927 --> 01:07:31,931
Open this door! It's me,
Daniele Soave. He's not there!

519
01:07:31,966 --> 01:07:34,433
Come on, open it.
The maniac's in the apartment!

520
01:07:34,468 --> 01:07:36,435
Quickly!

521
01:07:36,685 --> 01:07:39,438
Why should I trust you?
You could be the maniac.

522
01:07:39,473 --> 01:07:42,834
I'm a cop, damn it.
I'll show you my identification.

523
01:07:42,869 --> 01:07:46,195
Here. Look, can you
see it? No. No, I can't.

524
01:07:46,445 --> 01:07:50,449
- Wait. Now you can see it.
- Anyone can get one. It's a fake.

525
01:07:50,484 --> 01:07:54,418
No. Come on.
Let me in.

526
01:07:54,453 --> 01:07:56,921
No, you're fooling me.
Go away!

527
01:07:56,956 --> 01:08:00,459
Go away! Look, my
gun. It's police issue.

528
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:03,963
I've seen you before.
I know you. Please!

529
01:08:05,965 --> 01:08:09,468
No, not the gun!
I want to see your face again!

530
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:51,260
Come on, betty. You may
as well open the door now.

531
01:08:51,295 --> 01:08:53,762
One way or another,
i'm coming in!

532
01:08:54,263 --> 01:08:57,516
Betty!
You bastard!

533
01:08:57,551 --> 01:09:00,734
Son of a bitch!

534
01:09:00,769 --> 01:09:03,772
You're not going to get me!
You're not!

535
01:09:06,275 --> 01:09:09,278
I'll kill you!

536
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:32,101
You are feeling very calm.

537
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:36,105
Calm and relaxed.

538
01:09:36,605 --> 01:09:40,609
Concentrate only
on the music.

539
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:43,612
Breathe deeply.

540
01:09:45,114 --> 01:09:48,617
One, two, three,

541
01:09:48,652 --> 01:09:50,736
Four.

542
01:12:29,194 --> 01:12:32,162
Daniele Soave.

543
01:12:32,197 --> 01:12:34,700
So he was the policeman.

544
01:13:26,869 --> 01:13:31,338
Betty! Betty!
Come on. Come on!

545
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:35,377
Quickly! Quickly,
climb up here. Quickly!

546
01:13:35,412 --> 01:13:37,880
Quickly. Come on!

547
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:50,025
Where does this lead to?
To my apartment.

548
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,030
What were you doing
in here?

549
01:13:55,531 --> 01:14:00,536
I discovered it. It's the
old air-conditioning system.

550
01:14:00,571 --> 01:14:03,038
I can get to any apartment
i want.

551
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:06,792
Are you angry?
No, of course not.

552
01:14:06,827 --> 01:14:10,045
This apartment is empty.

553
01:14:10,546 --> 01:14:13,298
I watch you all the time.
Really?

554
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:16,016
Yes. I like it
when you sing.

555
01:14:16,051 --> 01:14:19,054
You have a beautiful voice. Thank you.

556
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:31,648
I watched that person
trying to kill you tonight.

557
01:14:31,683 --> 01:14:35,187
- Why do you come up here?
- To get away when my parents fight.

558
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:38,690
- So they hit each other.
- Mm-hmm.

559
01:14:43,695 --> 01:14:45,697
Here we are.

560
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:18,540
He's gone.
You are very clever.

561
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,545
You're the clever one.
You saved my life.

562
01:16:29,935 --> 01:16:32,402
Alma?

563
01:16:32,437 --> 01:16:36,441
Alma!
It's my mother.

564
01:16:40,946 --> 01:16:43,698
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

565
01:16:43,733 --> 01:16:46,416
Oh, it's you!
Mom, this is Betty.

566
01:16:46,451 --> 01:16:48,954
- Do you remember me?
- No, I don't remember you.

567
01:16:48,989 --> 01:16:51,957
Last night. You were
outside my apartment.

568
01:16:51,992 --> 01:16:54,424
All right,
you didn't see me.

569
01:16:54,459 --> 01:16:56,927
Listen, something terrible
has happened.

570
01:16:56,962 --> 01:16:59,464
Yeah, you coming in here.
Did you let her in, Alma?

571
01:16:59,965 --> 01:17:01,932
- Yes, she did.
- She's my friend.

572
01:17:01,967 --> 01:17:04,469
- I have to call the police.
- Get out of here.

573
01:17:06,221 --> 01:17:07,723
But she's my friend.
I don't care-

574
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,225
Please, where's the
phone? Did you hear me?

575
01:17:10,342 --> 01:17:13,228
Get out!

576
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:16,732
All right, i'm going.
But you call the police.

577
01:17:16,848 --> 01:17:20,317
You're so filthy!
Disgusting!

578
01:17:20,352 --> 01:17:22,854
You're disgusting!
You're always naked!

579
01:17:22,889 --> 01:17:24,856
That's enough!
Go to your room.

580
01:19:32,117 --> 01:19:34,584
What are you
doing here?

581
01:19:34,619 --> 01:19:37,087
Marc, did you hear
what happened?

582
01:19:37,122 --> 01:19:40,625
Yes. I phoned your apartment.
I spoke to a policeman.

583
01:19:40,660 --> 01:19:43,896
I didn't think
you'd come here.

584
01:19:43,931 --> 01:19:47,097
I just wanted
to run, hide.

585
01:19:47,132 --> 01:19:51,636
Everywhere scares me,
except here.

586
01:19:51,671 --> 01:19:54,139
I feel safe here.

587
01:19:55,140 --> 01:19:58,143
I'll sleep in my
dressing room. Oh, Betty?

588
01:20:00,145 --> 01:20:02,647
There's going to be
a lot of noise.

589
01:20:02,682 --> 01:20:05,115
The stagehands
are working.

590
01:20:05,150 --> 01:20:07,617
I've made a change in
the show. What change?

591
01:20:07,652 --> 01:20:11,656
I don't want you to worry, but i've
thought of a way to identify the killer.

592
01:20:11,773 --> 01:20:14,776
I don't know why
i didn't think of it before.

593
01:20:14,811 --> 01:20:17,279
We have an eyewitness.

594
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:21,783
And if the maniac's
in the audience tomorrow night,

595
01:20:21,818 --> 01:20:24,286
I've got him!

596
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,790
What if
he doesn't come?

597
01:20:28,825 --> 01:20:30,792
Oh, he'll come.

598
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:37,799
I'm so tired.
I just want to sleep.

599
01:20:37,834 --> 01:20:39,801
"To sleep-

600
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:43,805
"Perchance to dream.

601
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:45,807
"Aye, there's the rub,

602
01:20:46,308 --> 01:20:49,311
"For in that sleep of death
what dreams may come...

603
01:20:49,346 --> 01:20:51,313
"When we have shuffled off
this mortal coil...

604
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:54,449
Must give us pause."

605
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:10,525
Ahh.

606
01:22:41,006 --> 01:22:43,008
Is that you, mommy?

607
01:22:57,155 --> 01:23:02,160
I just had the same nightmare that
i used to have when I was a child,

608
01:23:02,195 --> 01:23:05,139
But I can't decide
whether it's just a dream...

609
01:23:05,174 --> 01:23:08,083
Or the memory of something
that really happened.

610
01:24:07,592 --> 01:24:10,595
What do you think
of it?

611
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:19,988
Relax, everything's fine.
Don't worry. We'll get him.

612
01:24:20,023 --> 01:24:22,455
But when?
Any time now.

613
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,992
Five. Six. Seven.

614
01:24:25,027 --> 01:24:27,460
Any time now.
Ten.

615
01:24:27,495 --> 01:24:30,498
Eleven. Twelve.
Thirteen.

616
01:24:30,999 --> 01:24:33,501
Fourteen. Fifteen.
Sixteen.

617
01:24:33,618 --> 01:24:36,121
Seventeen. Eighteen.
Nineteen.

618
01:24:36,156 --> 01:24:38,123
Twenty. Go.

619
01:25:29,307 --> 01:25:31,426
Now!

620
01:26:10,465 --> 01:26:13,468
Is this supposed to happen?
Is this part of the plot?

621
01:26:19,974 --> 01:26:22,977
It's flying above you.

622
01:28:02,210 --> 01:28:04,212
Police!

623
01:28:04,712 --> 01:28:07,582
- I told you i'd get him, didn't i?
- You're a genius!

624
01:29:10,111 --> 01:29:13,614
It's the policeman.

625
01:29:15,116 --> 01:29:17,083
Extraordinary.

626
01:29:17,118 --> 01:29:19,120
Why on earth
would he do it?

627
01:29:23,124 --> 01:29:26,627
Not a sound.

628
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:37,138
Shh.

629
01:29:40,641 --> 01:29:42,643
Just like your mother.

630
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:46,647
Your voice
is the same as hers.

631
01:29:46,682 --> 01:29:48,649
Your body,
even your skin.

632
01:29:49,016 --> 01:29:52,019
Oh, god.
How much I loved her.

633
01:29:52,520 --> 01:29:55,022
Don't.

634
01:29:55,523 --> 01:29:58,491
I don't want to kill you.

635
01:29:58,526 --> 01:30:01,028
She taught me
a cruel little game...

636
01:30:01,063 --> 01:30:03,298
Of killing
and torturing.

637
01:30:03,333 --> 01:30:05,533
Only then
could I have her.

638
01:30:07,535 --> 01:30:09,537
I was her slave.

639
01:30:23,601 --> 01:30:26,104
Calm down!

640
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:34,112
No!

641
01:30:43,621 --> 01:30:45,623
Sit down.

642
01:30:52,630 --> 01:30:55,633
Shh.
Come, come.

643
01:30:56,134 --> 01:30:58,136
When I saw you
last night,

644
01:30:58,171 --> 01:31:00,138
I thought
it was a miracle.

645
01:31:00,638 --> 01:31:02,140
Yes.

646
01:31:06,644 --> 01:31:09,147
Sit still!

647
01:31:18,156 --> 01:31:21,159
But there was
something missing.

648
01:31:25,663 --> 01:31:29,667
You weren't the star like she
was, so I had to get rid of Mara.

649
01:31:34,672 --> 01:31:38,926
Aah! All I wanted was your love.

650
01:31:38,961 --> 01:31:43,181
But people
don't understand.

651
01:31:44,182 --> 01:31:46,184
And now it's all over.

652
01:31:54,692 --> 01:31:58,696
How could you love me,
a monster?

653
01:32:02,700 --> 01:32:05,703
No! I don't want you
to look at me anymore.

654
01:32:20,218 --> 01:32:23,087
It's better I die.

655
01:32:23,122 --> 01:32:25,389
Yes.

656
01:32:33,648 --> 01:32:37,652
I want to burn!
No one will ever find me.

657
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:43,157
I'll disappear.

658
01:32:44,659 --> 01:32:47,662
No one will ever find me.

659
01:32:47,697 --> 01:32:49,780
No.

660
01:32:58,923 --> 01:33:01,926
Smell it?
Gasoline.

661
01:33:17,441 --> 01:33:19,443
Are you afraid?

662
01:33:19,944 --> 01:33:21,410
I am.

663
01:33:21,445 --> 01:33:24,448
I'm afraid of pain.

664
01:33:26,951 --> 01:33:28,953
Will you help me?

665
01:33:30,321 --> 01:33:33,824
Here. Take it.

666
01:33:34,959 --> 01:33:37,461
Hold it steady.

667
01:33:40,464 --> 01:33:42,431
Good.

668
01:33:42,466 --> 01:33:46,587
Good! Hold it.
Higher.

669
01:33:48,089 --> 01:33:50,091
Higher!

670
01:33:50,591 --> 01:33:54,595
To your left. To your left!

671
01:33:55,596 --> 01:33:57,563
Too far.

672
01:33:57,598 --> 01:34:02,603
Good. Now... shoot. Shoot!

673
01:34:03,988 --> 01:34:06,956
What are you
waiting for?

674
01:34:06,991 --> 01:34:11,362
Haven't I hurt you enough?
You want to hear more?

675
01:34:11,862 --> 01:34:15,331
I strangled your mother.
She was too greedy.

676
01:34:15,366 --> 01:34:17,868
She wanted more blood, more cruelty,
and she wouldn't let me touch her!

677
01:34:20,371 --> 01:34:22,757
And you know what?
I enjoyed killing her.

678
01:34:58,459 --> 01:35:01,579
I can't get out!

679
01:35:02,079 --> 01:35:04,331
Oh, my god!

680
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:28,916
I can't get out!

681
01:36:31,051 --> 01:36:33,554
I can't get out!

682
01:36:40,811 --> 01:36:42,813
Quickly, quickly!

683
01:36:43,814 --> 01:36:46,066
He's dead!
Oh, my god, he's dead!

684
01:37:04,502 --> 01:37:07,470
Paris means a lot to me.

685
01:37:07,505 --> 01:37:10,508
We'll make this Traviata
unbelievable.

686
01:37:11,008 --> 01:37:13,010
How do you want
to play her?

687
01:37:13,045 --> 01:37:16,514
Tender? Timid?

688
01:37:16,549 --> 01:37:18,481
Sensual?

689
01:37:18,516 --> 01:37:21,484
Guten tag.
Guten tag.

690
01:37:21,519 --> 01:37:26,023
Well? I don't think the
problem exists any longer.

691
01:37:30,528 --> 01:37:33,030
Ciao.

692
01:37:36,033 --> 01:37:38,536
I knew it!

693
01:38:41,599 --> 01:38:45,102
There has been a new
and surprising development...

694
01:38:45,352 --> 01:38:47,354
In the case of the crime
at the opera.

695
01:38:47,855 --> 01:38:50,357
You'll no doubt remember the
report that suspected maniac killer,

696
01:38:50,858 --> 01:38:53,360
Inspector Alan Santini,

697
01:38:53,477 --> 01:38:56,730
Died in the fire that destroyed
one wing of the theater.

698
01:38:56,765 --> 01:38:59,949
The police now inform us
that the charred remains...

699
01:38:59,984 --> 01:39:03,487
Of the body they had presumed was
Santini's, are not human at all...

700
01:39:03,871 --> 01:39:06,373
Oh, my god. But those of
a theatrical mannequin.

701
01:39:06,874 --> 01:39:10,002
The authorities now realize
that Santini planned...

702
01:39:10,037 --> 01:39:13,130
This imaginative,
dramatic coup de theatre...

703
01:39:13,631 --> 01:39:17,635
As a delaying action to
give himself time to escape.

704
01:39:18,135 --> 01:39:20,137
A nationwide hunt is
already underway for Santini,

705
01:39:20,387 --> 01:39:22,855
Who is considered
to be extremely dangerous.

706
01:39:22,890 --> 01:39:27,895
The police forces of neighboring countries
and Interpol are giving their cooperation.

707
01:39:29,396 --> 01:39:33,365
Betty, he's not dead!
He's alive!

708
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,904
He's here! Run!
For god's sake, run!

709
01:39:37,404 --> 01:39:39,773
Run!

710
01:40:37,331 --> 01:40:39,548
No!

711
01:40:39,583 --> 01:40:42,469
No! No!

712
01:40:49,343 --> 01:40:52,221
I am like my mother.

713
01:40:52,256 --> 01:40:55,099
I realize it now.

714
01:41:00,104 --> 01:41:03,107
I wanted you to win,
to kill him.

715
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:10,998
I'm exactly like her.

716
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:16,503
Come. We must get away.

717
01:41:16,538 --> 01:41:18,505
Come!

718
01:41:23,510 --> 01:41:27,347
Before someone finds
the body, huh?

719
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:36,473
Come. Let us go.
