1
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,933
我想要一辆车
I want a car.

2
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:23,520
我需要车的帮助
Chicks dig the car.

3
00:02:23,731 --> 00:02:26,814
这就是超人总是一个人行动的原因
This is why Superman works alone.

4
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:38,787
试试把这辆车完整的开回来。
Do try and bring this one back in one piece, sir!

5
00:03:08,236 --> 00:03:09,610
不要等我了
Don't wait up, Al.

6
00:03:09,822 --> 00:03:12,276
我会取消那些pizza
I'll cancel the pizzas.

7
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,335
蝙蝠侠，一个新的坏人
Batman, a new villain has commandeered the Gotham Museum.

8
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,672
霸占了哥谭博物馆

9
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:33,759
那些古董的翅膀被冻住了。
He's frozen the antiquities wing.

10
00:03:33,972 --> 00:03:36,379
那些保安也变成了冰块
He's turned the security guards into ice.

11
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:38,887
他称他自己为急冻先生
He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze."

12
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:41,058
急冻先生
Mr. Freeze.

13
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:06,037
立即停止
- Stop! - Drop your weapon!

14
00:04:06,256 --> 00:04:08,663
放下武器 不然我要开枪了
Stop or we'll shoot!

15
00:04:21,689 --> 00:04:24,096
急冻人来了
The Iceman cometh.

16
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:27,558
拜托，请你有点怜悯之心
Please, show some mercy.

17
00:04:27,778 --> 00:04:29,437
怜悯？？？
Mercy?!

18
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,445
恐怕我现在的条件
I'm afraid that my condition has left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

19
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,984
只允许我对你的恳求来一些冷冻

20
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:38,492
不要！

21
00:04:46,882 --> 00:04:48,541
啊。。。

22
00:04:54,139 --> 00:04:59,014
在这个宇宙，只有一种绝对
In this universe...

23
00:04:56,088 --> 00:04:58,549
...there's only one absolute.

24
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:04,601
就是冰冻
Everything...

25
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:04,054
...freezes.

26
00:05:09,448 --> 00:05:12,152
嗨，急冻人，我是蝙蝠侠。
Hi, Freeze. I'm Batman.

27
00:05:31,053 --> 00:05:33,460
你不会也把我冷冻吧？
You're not sending me to the cooler.

28
00:05:50,574 --> 00:05:53,028
接的不错。 你把它打碎了，就要把他买下来。
- Nice catch. - You break it, you buy it.

29
00:05:53,244 --> 00:05:56,576
抓住珠宝，把那些人都杀掉。
Grab the gem! Kill the heroes!

30
00:06:09,511 --> 00:06:12,795
没错，杀掉他们。杀掉他们
Yes, kill them! Kill them! Yes!

31
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:16,007
毁灭一切！！
Destroy everything!

32
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:28,443
这是从地狱来的曲棍球队。
It's the hockey team from hell.

33
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:05,853
你去拿那个钻石，我来对付那个冰人。
You get the ice, I'll get the Iceman.

34
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,120
啊。。
Ah.

35
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:28,249
啊。。。

36
00:07:31,513 --> 00:07:32,841
谢谢。
Thanks.

37
00:07:33,056 --> 00:07:34,846
啊

38
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,443
好极了。
Sweet.

39
00:07:55,204 --> 00:07:57,528
我的已经准备好了，你的呢？
I got mine. Where's yours?

40
00:07:59,334 --> 00:08:03,414
恐龙为什么灭绝呢？是冰河
What killed the dinosaurs?

41
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,442
The Ice Age!

42
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:57,226
来吧，小子们！！
Hit me, boys.

43
00:08:59,188 --> 00:09:01,974
啊。。谢谢你来玩儿。
Thanks for playing.

44
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,592
我原本就希望你们会来。
I was hoping you'd drop in.

45
00:10:03,589 --> 00:10:05,830
哦，是的。
Oh, yes.

46
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:32,233
看看这些数字，这就是你末日的预兆
Watch the numbers...

47
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:32,215
...for they are the harbingers of your doom.

48
00:10:32,454 --> 00:10:36,783
你能感觉到吗？？这个冰冷的世界。
Can you feel it coming?

49
00:10:33,717 --> 00:10:36,803
The icy cold of space.

50
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:38,494
啊。。。
At 30,000 feet, your heart will freeze...

51
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:41,710
在三千英尺的高度，你的心脏都会冰冻起来。

52
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:44,248
不再跳动。
...and beat no more.

53
00:10:53,892 --> 00:10:55,266
在你被冻住以后
After you're frozen, your icy tomb will plummet back to Gotham.

54
00:10:55,478 --> 00:10:57,766
你的冰墓就会垂直落回到哥谭镇。

55
00:10:57,981 --> 00:10:59,391
急冻人，你这个疯子！
Freeze, you're mad.

56
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:02,394
一旦这个爆炸，成千上万的人都会死掉。
This capsule explodes, it'll slaughter thousands.

57
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,068
冻的好。
Freeze well.

58
00:11:26,969 --> 00:11:29,720
谁请你来的？ 我只是在附近，经过而已。
- Who invited you? - I was hanging around.

59
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:32,717
我还以为你会留在博物馆里。
I thought you'd stay in the museum, round up some thugs.

60
00:11:32,934 --> 00:11:35,969
何不这么说， 非常高兴你能够来救我。
How about, "Nice to see you. Thanks for saving my life."

61
00:11:48,117 --> 00:11:49,610
一个蝙蝠炸弹？
- A batbomb? - We must blow this up...

62
00:11:49,827 --> 00:11:52,531
我们必须在哥谭镇变成 一个弹坑之前把这个吹起来。
...before it turns Gotham into a crater.

63
00:11:52,747 --> 00:11:54,573
“哔。。。”

64
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,700
现在怎么办？叫辆出租车？
Now what, call a taxi?!

65
00:11:56,917 --> 00:11:58,494
自己看第一步。
Watch the first step!

66
00:11:59,587 --> 00:12:00,831
冲浪准备好了
Surf's up!

67
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:08,470
“哔哔哔。。。”

68
00:12:35,584 --> 00:12:37,161
接住了。
Gotcha!

69
00:12:42,966 --> 00:12:45,919
Cowabungaaaa!
Cowabunga!

70
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:54,262
Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo!

71
00:13:02,569 --> 00:13:05,273
他要把炉子也冻起来了。
He's freezing the furnace!

72
00:13:45,782 --> 00:13:48,568
我抓到他了。 洛宾，不要。
- I got him. - Robin, no!

73
00:13:54,123 --> 00:13:57,158
冷静一点， 会飞的孩子。
Stay cool, Birdboy.

74
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:08,422
你能变冷吗？蝙蝠侠。
Can you be cold? You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

75
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,180
你有11分钟来给这个孩子解冻。

76
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,724
你会怎么办呢？？？ 继续去追坏人，还是救这个孩子？
Will you chase the villain or save the boy?

77
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:17,055
哈哈，你的情感让你变得脆弱。
Your emotions make you weak. That's why this day is mine.

78
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,723
这就是为什么今天是属于我的。哈哈哈哈。

79
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,770
我下次一定要杀了你。
I'll kill you next time!

80
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,075
我们抓住他了吗？
Did we get him?

81
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:23,503
该死的！
Drats!

82
00:15:23,718 --> 00:15:25,923
我的试验是培育出食人兰花
My experiment to mate the orchid and the rattlesnake has failed again...

83
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:28,592
和南美响尾蛇，但是都失败了

84
00:15:28,807 --> 00:15:31,475
但我还是抱着希望
...but I still have hope for the animal-plant crossbreedings.

85
00:15:31,686 --> 00:15:33,678
尤其是在动物植物的杂交配种方面

86
00:15:35,148 --> 00:15:38,183
现在只需要我找出毒液的正确剂量
If I can only find the right dose of venom...

87
00:15:38,401 --> 00:15:41,851
这些植物就可以象动物 那样凶狠的战斗了
...these plants will be able to fight back, like animals.

88
00:15:42,363 --> 00:15:45,695
我要用花神的力量
I will have given flora...

89
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:48,698
...a chance against the thoughtless ravages of man.

90
00:15:45,909 --> 00:15:48,399
去反击无知男人带来的破坏

91
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:51,572
【试验品】啊！

92
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,449
个人记录
Personal note:

93
00:15:53,667 --> 00:15:56,418
我的工作可以更快的进行了
My work would proceed faster...

94
00:15:56,628 --> 00:15:59,711
如果Woodrue博士往他的神秘的
...if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk my venom samples...

95
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:02,876
吉尔加美什翅膀加入我的毒液样本
...back to his mysterious Gilgamesh Wing.

96
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:05,046
他为什么不让我进入他的实验室呢
Why won't he let me in the lab?

97
00:16:05,262 --> 00:16:07,467
【试验品】啊！

98
00:16:07,681 --> 00:16:10,253
他在这儿干什么
What is he doing in there?

99
00:16:27,202 --> 00:16:32,907
未联合王国的女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen of the un-United Nations...

100
00:16:33,751 --> 00:16:34,781
【拨号音】
...and our mystery bidder...

101
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:36,875
我们的神秘买主

102
00:16:37,087 --> 00:16:38,545
让我来介绍
...may I present...

103
00:16:38,756 --> 00:16:41,127
安东尼奥。迪亚哥
...Antonio Diego...

104
00:16:41,342 --> 00:16:45,754
连环杀手，现在在监狱里面
...serial murderer, serving life in prison...

105
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:48,972
并且唯一生还的志愿者
...and sole surviving...

106
00:16:49,183 --> 00:16:50,380
【吐口水】
...volunteer.

107
00:16:50,602 --> 00:16:53,602
他是多么的迷人啊
And what a charmer he is.

108
00:16:54,564 --> 00:16:58,014
只要能够把那三个同心洞
By merely drilling three concentric holes...

109
00:16:58,234 --> 00:17:02,646
直接放到安东尼奥的颅腔里面
...directly into Antonio's cranial cavity...

110
00:17:02,865 --> 00:17:04,489
我已经在他大脑的
...I have created viaducts into the most primitive part of his brain...

111
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:08,198
最原始的部分创造了一个间道

112
00:17:08,412 --> 00:17:10,783
就是边缘系统
...the limbic system.

113
00:17:10,998 --> 00:17:12,657
哈哈哈
And now I add...

114
00:17:12,875 --> 00:17:17,417
那么现在我就要加入我的超级军人的血清

115
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:17,078
...my Super-Soldier Serum...

116
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,918
编好代码的毒液
...code-named "Venom"...

117
00:17:20,132 --> 00:17:22,503
加到那个自己我开的
...to which I add my very own recipe of steroids...

118
00:17:22,719 --> 00:17:25,968
类固醇和霉素的处方
...and toxins.

119
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,762
把他放进去
Plug him in.

120
00:17:28,975 --> 00:17:30,552
尖叫的时间到了
Time to scream.

121
00:17:34,606 --> 00:17:36,894
（隐约的尖叫）

122
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,942
啊

123
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,925
天才！
Genius!

124
00:18:06,139 --> 00:18:09,886
看！理想毁灭了机器
Behold...

125
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,631
...the ideal killing machine!

126
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:12,509
我叫这个小数字
I call this little number...

127
00:18:12,729 --> 00:18:14,222
祸害
..."Bane."

128
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,440
人性的祸害
Bane of Humanity!

129
00:18:17,652 --> 00:18:20,438
想想看，你的私人军队
Imagine it.

130
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:22,560
Your own private army made up of thousands of these super-soldiers.

131
00:18:20,654 --> 00:18:23,819
由成千上万这些超级战士组成

132
00:18:24,033 --> 00:18:26,986
叫价至少从一千万起
Bidding begins at a mere 10 million!

133
00:18:27,203 --> 00:18:30,322
加速，给爸爸炫耀一下
Turbo!

134
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,193
Show off for Daddy.

135
00:19:06,703 --> 00:19:09,738
祸害

136
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:11,706
噢！

137
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:14,240
Isley博士
Dr. Isley.

138
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:19,000
欢迎来做客
Welcome to my parlor.

139
00:19:19,216 --> 00:19:21,172
什么？
What?

140
00:19:21,386 --> 00:19:23,958
你这个怪物！你怎么能这样？
You monster!

141
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,830
How could you?!

142
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,797
我们的赞助人不能容忍军事应用
Our original sponsor had no stomach for military applications.

143
00:19:28,017 --> 00:19:29,759
他断了我们的资金
- He cut the funding for our work. - Our work?

144
00:19:29,978 --> 00:19:31,471
我们的工作？
Without your research...

145
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:33,643
没有你的研究，我就不能有现在的成绩
...I couldn't have come this far. Join me.

146
00:19:33,857 --> 00:19:37,640
一起来吧。我们两并肩作战
- The two of us, entwined, side by side. - Join you?

147
00:19:37,862 --> 00:19:39,652
加入你？

148
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:44,608
我已经致力于保护濒危植物了
I have spent my life trying to protect plants from extinction...

149
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:51,363
但你的疯狂计划毁了我的研究
...and now you corrupt my research...

150
00:19:48,688 --> 00:19:52,233
...into some maniacal scheme for world domination?

151
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,824
为了控制世界？

152
00:19:54,044 --> 00:19:58,456
我要是成功了，你就没机会
When I get through...

153
00:19:56,196 --> 00:20:00,783
...you won't be able to get a job teaching high school chemistry.

154
00:19:58,674 --> 00:20:01,081
再教高中化学了

155
00:20:01,303 --> 00:20:05,632
听见了吗？你这个变态？
Do you hear me?!

156
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:05,163
You psycho!

157
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:10,974
好，我尊重你的选择
Well, I can respect your opinion.

158
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:13,807
不幸的是，我不喜欢被拒绝
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

159
00:20:14,024 --> 00:20:16,181
我想你不得不去死了！哈哈！
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

160
00:20:16,402 --> 00:20:19,437
啊！

161
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:29,661
啊！

162
00:20:38,925 --> 00:20:41,296
好。好。
Yes. Yes.

163
00:20:41,511 --> 00:20:45,424
让这些毒药和霉素给你锻造一个坟墓
Let the poisons and toxins burn a grave for you...

164
00:20:45,641 --> 00:20:48,475
在这个你很喜爱的地球深处
...deep into the earth you love so much!

165
00:20:48,686 --> 00:20:50,428
再见，亲爱的
Bye-bye, dear!

166
00:20:50,646 --> 00:20:51,974
疯狂的家伙
Fellow maniacs...

167
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,234
叫价开始！
...bidding begins!

168
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:08,076
两年前哥谭大学实验室保安闭路电视
Gotham University Labs security video, two years ago.

169
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:11,159
维克多.福莱斯博士，两届奥运混十项全能
Dr. Victor Fries...

170
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:13,690
...two-time Olympic decathlete and Nobel Prize winner for molecular biology.

171
00:21:11,376 --> 00:21:13,202
和分子生物学诺贝尔奖获得者

172
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:17,749
在她妻子得了一种稀有的病，麦氏综合症后
After his wife contracted a rare disease, Macgregor's Syndrome...

173
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:21,001
他希望把它冻起来，知道他找到解药
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic sleep until he could find a cure.

174
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,670
这就是现在越来越冷的原因
Now, here's where everything goes north.

175
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:30,436
啊！啊！

176
00:21:31,355 --> 00:21:32,683
这太痛苦了
That's got to hurt.

177
00:21:32,899 --> 00:21:34,938
这些液体是零下50度
That liquid is 50 below.

178
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:37,985
某种程度上他还活着
But he survived somehow.

179
00:21:38,196 --> 00:21:40,982
他的身体在冷冻状态下变异了
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

180
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:47,236
他妻子怎么了？
- What happened to his wife? - Nobody knows for sure.

181
00:21:47,455 --> 00:21:50,123
没人知道确切的原因，人们以为她死了
She's presumed dead.

182
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,289
只能在极度寒冷下生存
Fries needs extreme cold to survive.

183
00:21:52,503 --> 00:21:54,993
他的冷冻服是用的钻石增强镭射材料
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced lasers to keep him at 0 degrees.

184
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:57,882
以保持他的身体在零度一下

185
00:21:58,092 --> 00:22:01,507
哦，如果这是冰，那冰人想要
If it's ice the Iceman wants....

186
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,840
Alfred?
Alfred.

187
00:22:06,767 --> 00:22:08,593
Alfred
Alfred.

188
00:22:12,065 --> 00:22:13,475
来了，先生
Coming, sir.

189
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:16,020
我在，先生
Yes, sir?

190
00:22:16,237 --> 00:22:17,861
我们需要韦恩钻石
We need the Wayne diamonds.

191
00:22:18,071 --> 00:22:19,813
我们要把自己困成雪人？
We going to trap a snowman?

192
00:22:20,032 --> 00:22:23,115
正是，就在你在模拟器里
Absolutely, right after you spend 10 hours in the simulator, training.

193
00:22:23,326 --> 00:22:24,606
训练10小时之后
I made a mistake. I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

194
00:22:24,829 --> 00:22:28,244
我搞错了，对不起，这个不会发生的

195
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:30,496
你这么不计后果，几乎自己死于冷冻
You were reckless and almost got killed.

196
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:33,543
我很好，看到了吗？我，在这里，活着
I'm fine! See! Me, here, alive!

197
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:36,789
如果你不信任我，我们怎么在一起工作呢？
How we supposed to work together if you won't trust me?

198
00:22:39,218 --> 00:22:41,672
要多么信任？
How indeed?

199
00:22:41,888 --> 00:22:44,804
他太渴望和冲动了
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

200
00:22:45,016 --> 00:22:47,055
我不能信任他不被伤害
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

201
00:22:47,268 --> 00:22:51,265
事实上你也许不信任任何人
Perhaps the truth is you really don't trust anyone.

202
00:22:51,481 --> 00:22:55,014
不要告诉我你又站在他那边了
Don't tell me you're on his side again.

203
00:22:55,235 --> 00:22:57,559
尽管你很有天分
Despite all your talents...

204
00:22:57,779 --> 00:23:00,862
你仍然不懂得选择方法
...you're still just a novice in the ways of family.

205
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:04,525
Dick先生和你用的同一种方法
Master Dick follows the same star as you...

206
00:23:04,746 --> 00:23:07,911
但是通过自己的方法达到了
...but gets there by his own course.

207
00:23:08,124 --> 00:23:09,831
你必须学会信任他
You must learn to trust him, for that is the nature of family.

208
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:12,958
因为这是这个定义的本质

209
00:23:13,171 --> 00:23:14,581
我信任你，Alfred
I trust you, Alfred.

210
00:23:14,797 --> 00:23:19,126
但是我不可能永远在这儿
But I shan't be here forever.

211
00:23:21,137 --> 00:23:24,006
晚安，Bruce先生
Good night, Master Bruce.

212
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,725
晚安，Alfred
Good night, Alfred.

213
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,115
哦，亲爱的Bruce先生
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

214
00:23:50,335 --> 00:23:52,659
很好，很乱嘛
Good gracious, what a tumble.

215
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:55,036
好勇敢的孩子
There's a brave boy.

216
00:24:04,016 --> 00:24:06,969
是的，先生，我非常高兴你赢得拍卖
Yes, sir. I am so pleased you won the bidding, Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

217
00:24:07,186 --> 00:24:09,094
你太无情了

218
00:24:09,314 --> 00:24:12,516
我们现在就做最后的修改
We're making the final modifications on Bane right now.

219
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,275
我们有个无与媲美的超级战士
We'll have a flawless super-soldier out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

220
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:16,809
通过晚间快递，明天一早就到你那里了

221
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:20,065
【隆隆声】

222
00:24:34,298 --> 00:24:36,254
噢！

223
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:40,461
Isley博士？
Dr. Isley?

224
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,929
哦？帕梅拉？
- Pamela? - Mm-hm.

225
00:24:44,142 --> 00:24:46,264
你看上去很好
You look great.

226
00:24:46,477 --> 00:24:48,018
尤其对一个死去的女人
Especially for a dead woman.

227
00:24:48,229 --> 00:24:52,273
嗨，Jason
Hello, Jason.

228
00:24:52,483 --> 00:24:55,020
我想我已经换了一个心脏
I think I've had a change of heart.

229
00:24:55,237 --> 00:24:58,356
我？看来是
- Or quite literally... - Me?

230
00:24:58,573 --> 00:25:03,448
动植物霉素有个适当的单一影响
...the animal-plant toxins had a rather unique effect on me.

231
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:06,366
他们把我的血换成了芦荟的
They replaced my blood with aloe...

232
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:09,201
皮肤换成了叶绿素
...my skin with chlorophyll...

233
00:25:09,418 --> 00:25:14,245
并且现在我的嘴唇，填满了
...and filled...

234
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:13,095
...my lips...

235
00:25:14,464 --> 00:25:16,206
蕖！！

236
00:25:24,226 --> 00:25:25,968
仇恨
...with venom.

237
00:25:28,063 --> 00:25:32,356
哦，对了，Jason，还有件事
Oh...

238
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:30,988
...and, Jason, one other thing.

239
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:36,266
我应该早点发现说起这件事
I probably should have mentioned this earlier...

240
00:25:36,488 --> 00:25:39,903
我是毒药
...I'm...

241
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:39,789
...poison.

242
00:25:40,118 --> 00:25:42,904
啊。。。

243
00:25:43,538 --> 00:25:46,289
Whoo..
Whoo.

244
00:25:46,498 --> 00:25:48,822
现在是个生死关头
It's a jungle in here.

245
00:25:49,835 --> 00:25:52,788
我是个自然界的武器
I am Nature's arm...

246
00:25:53,005 --> 00:25:55,459
她的精神
...her spirit...

247
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:57,334
她的意志
...her will!

248
00:25:57,551 --> 00:25:59,839
该死，我是大自然母亲
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

249
00:26:00,054 --> 00:26:03,753
现在该是植物重新控制世界的时候了
And the time has come...

250
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:03,646
...for plants to take back...

251
00:26:03,976 --> 00:26:07,141
这个世界就是我们的
...the world so rightfully ours...

252
00:26:07,355 --> 00:26:09,560
因为这不太好
...because it's not nice...

253
00:26:09,773 --> 00:26:13,306
去欺骗大自然母亲
...to fool with Mother Nature.

254
00:26:18,115 --> 00:26:20,783
"嗯，“韦恩企业”
Hmm. "Wayne Enterprises."

255
00:26:20,993 --> 00:26:24,277
呃

256
00:26:24,498 --> 00:26:27,367
来了，亲爱的祸害
Coming, Bane, darling.

257
00:26:27,584 --> 00:26:29,825
我们还要赶飞机呢
We've got a plane to catch.

258
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:41,840
【歌声】
I'm Mr. White Christmas

259
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:44,770
I'm Mr. Snow

260
00:26:45,185 --> 00:26:48,019
我是冰柱先生
I'm Mr. Icicle

261
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:50,187
我是Ten Below先生
I'm Mr. Ten Below

262
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,597
唱吧，唱吧
Sing! Sing!

263
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,477
雪人守财奴。

264
00:26:53,694 --> 00:26:57,393
不论我碰到什么东西，都会变成冰雪。

265
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,820
来呀，唱罢！
Come on, sing!

266
00:27:00,034 --> 00:27:03,865
再大声一点。唱罢！唱罢！
Louder! Come on!

267
00:27:01,829 --> 00:27:03,706
Sing, sing, sing! Come on!

268
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,451
他和白色圣诞先生是一伙的。
He's Mr. White Christmas

269
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,286
再大声一点。啊。
Come on, louder!

270
00:27:09,503 --> 00:27:11,708
他是冰柱先生。
He's Mr. Icicle

271
00:27:11,922 --> 00:27:13,830
冷冻人。
Freezy...

272
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:15,708
我觉得很热。
...I'm feeling hot.

273
00:27:15,926 --> 00:27:17,752
我觉得那不太可能吧。
- I find that unlikely. - Okay.

274
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:22,133
好吧。那么我的头发很脆弱，我的皮肤也很干燥。
So my hair is brittle and my skin is dry...

275
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:24,591
为了得到你，我就要使用暴风雪了。
...I'd weather blizzards to have you.

276
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,134
你是我所认识的最完美的男人了。
You're the most perfect man I've ever known.

277
00:27:27,355 --> 00:27:29,477
你认为我们把这儿所有的东西都加热怎么样？
What do you say we heat things up?

278
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,144
我的感情驱使我把我的新娘解冻。
My passion thaws for my bride alone.

279
00:27:32,361 --> 00:27:34,187
唔。。

280
00:27:34,405 --> 00:27:36,942
说说你冰冷的肩膀
Talk about your cold shoulder.

281
00:27:41,953 --> 00:27:44,194
冻霜！ 是，老大！
Frosty!

282
00:27:42,912 --> 00:27:44,080
Yeah, boss?

283
00:27:44,414 --> 00:27:46,655
啊。。能量。
Ah. Energy.

284
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:50,833
跟那个蝙蝠战斗简直耗尽了我的能量。
Battling the Bat exhausted my power.

285
00:27:53,173 --> 00:27:55,330
啊。。

286
00:27:55,552 --> 00:27:57,544
不过。。。
But...

287
00:27:57,762 --> 00:28:01,130
我仍然是赢了。
...I was successful nevertheless.

288
00:28:01,349 --> 00:28:02,723
当然了，老大。
Absolutely, boss.

289
00:28:02,934 --> 00:28:05,305
再有一个这么大的巨型钻石。
One more giant diamond of this size...

290
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,137
我的能量就又都会补充回来啦。哈。
...and my freezing engine will be complete.

291
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:11,479
啊。。。

292
00:28:11,693 --> 00:28:13,732
我就会把整个城市都冻起来。
I will freeze the city.

293
00:28:13,946 --> 00:28:16,151
然后，我就可以用哥谭镇来进行敲诈。
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

294
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:18,736
直到这个城市把钻石都给我。
Unless the city bows to my demands...

295
00:28:18,951 --> 00:28:21,820
哥谭镇永远都是冬天！
...it's winter forever in Gotham.

296
00:28:22,038 --> 00:28:23,745
别无选择。
The city fathers will have no choice...

297
00:28:23,956 --> 00:28:26,244
只有给我所有我需要的经费。
...but to give me the billions I need to complete my research...

298
00:28:26,459 --> 00:28:28,000
来完成我的研究。

299
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,668
那样的话，我就可以找到一个治疗的办法
...so I can find a cure.

300
00:28:32,882 --> 00:28:34,708
你可以离开了。
Leave us.

301
00:28:34,926 --> 00:28:36,668
是，老大。
Sure, boss.

302
00:28:38,639 --> 00:28:40,761
我们需要高质量的时间。
We need quality time.

303
00:28:57,282 --> 00:29:00,981
很快， 我们又可以重新在一起了。
Soon we will be together once more.

304
00:29:01,204 --> 00:29:03,077
很快。
Soon.

305
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,217
【门铃声】

306
00:29:22,059 --> 00:29:23,967
Alfred
Alfred.

307
00:29:24,186 --> 00:29:25,514
【门铃声】
I'll get it.

308
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,603
我去开。

309
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:34,355
【门铃声】

310
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:40,074
我一定是不小心睡着了 十分对不起先生
I must've dozed off. My sincerest apologies.

311
00:29:40,286 --> 00:29:42,028
没关系，Alfred
No apology necessary.

312
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:44,618
这是三十年来发生的头一回。
It's the first time it's happened in 30 years.

313
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:59,221
你找什么呢？
Please be looking for me.

314
00:29:59,431 --> 00:30:03,511
事实上我来找我Alfred叔叔。
Actually, I'm looking for Alfred Pennyworth.

315
00:30:03,727 --> 00:30:05,884
Alfred叔叔。
Uncle Alfred.

316
00:30:07,231 --> 00:30:08,393
Alfred叔叔。
Uncle Alfred!

317
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,848
哦。。亲爱的。
Oh, my dear.

318
00:30:11,069 --> 00:30:12,266
哦，亲爱的。
Oh, my dear...

319
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:15,238
天大的一个惊喜啊
...what a most wonderful surprise.

320
00:30:15,449 --> 00:30:16,693
这么大的世界你是怎么找来的啊？
How did you manage to come here all the way from England?

321
00:30:16,908 --> 00:30:18,152
毕竟从英国出来又那么多的路线呢
My dear, you are so kind to your old uncle.

322
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,202
哦亲爱的，你对你年老的叔叔还真是礼貌呢。

323
00:30:21,413 --> 00:30:23,239
叔叔？
Uncle?

324
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:30,082
芭芭拉是我妹妹玛格丽特的女儿。
Barbara is the daughter of my dear sister Margaret.

325
00:30:30,297 --> 00:30:33,712
我父母5年前因为一场以外去世了。
Both my parents were killed in a car accident five years ago.

326
00:30:33,927 --> 00:30:35,883
从那个时候开始，Alfred叔叔就一直照顾我。
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me ever since.

327
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:38,217
你有秘密？？
- You have? - Secrets, Al?

328
00:30:38,431 --> 00:30:42,428
这所房子里面的每个人都有秘密。
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite in this house.

329
00:30:42,644 --> 00:30:44,185
不是吗？
Don't you think, sir?

330
00:30:44,395 --> 00:30:45,723
我正好是从
I'm on break from--

331
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:49,058
牛津剑桥大学，爱福来德的母校。
Oxbridge Academy, Alfred's alma mater.

332
00:30:49,276 --> 00:30:51,564
新的电脑科学分过来。
The new computer sciences division.

333
00:30:51,778 --> 00:30:53,106
你怎么知道？
- How'd you know? - Says so on the patch on your sweater.

334
00:30:53,322 --> 00:30:55,527
你的制服上有标签啊。

335
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:01,694
哦。。这个是，，真漂亮。
Oh.

336
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:03,612
- What is it? It's beautiful. - You can say that again.

337
00:31:01,914 --> 00:31:03,989
你可以再说一次。

338
00:31:04,208 --> 00:31:05,950
这是辆赛车。我正在修理。
It's a competition racer.

339
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:07,366
真的吗？
- I've been fixing it up. - Really?

340
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,163
有空我会教你怎么开。
- I'll show you how to ride it. - You certainly will not!

341
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,957
你不是吧 ？
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred. I'm terrified of these things.

342
00:31:11,173 --> 00:31:12,417
不用担心，Alfred叔叔

343
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:14,708
我会被这些东西吓坏。

344
00:31:14,927 --> 00:31:16,586
芭芭拉，我希望你能在这儿住下来。
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

345
00:31:16,805 --> 00:31:17,835
哦，，先生，
Oh, I don't know.

346
00:31:18,057 --> 00:31:19,467
我不知道可不可以。
All this luxury really isn't my style, but...

347
00:31:19,683 --> 00:31:21,473
这些豪华的东西根本不是我的风格。

348
00:31:21,685 --> 00:31:24,257
不过，我还是非常愿意留下来。
...yeah, I'd love to.

349
00:31:24,479 --> 00:31:26,886
那好，就这么说定了。
Then it's settled.

350
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:29,312
哦。。可是，，先生，，唔。。
Oh, but, sir, we....

351
00:31:29,527 --> 00:31:30,901
我们会变得非常忙碌啊。
We do get so busy here.

352
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:32,735
别傻了，Alfred
Don't be silly.

353
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:35,235
无论怎么说，她都是个家人嘛。
After all, she's family.

354
00:31:50,465 --> 00:31:51,579
【敲门声】
Uncle Alfred?

355
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,376
Alfred叔叔。

356
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:57,253
我来打搅你一下。
I came to tuck you in.

357
00:31:57,472 --> 00:31:59,713
你来打搅我？！
You came to tuck me in?

358
00:31:59,933 --> 00:32:01,759
那正好休息一下。
That's quite a switch.

359
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:04,682
是啊。你在弄什么呢？
Yes. What're you working on?

360
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:06,605
我正在努力寻找我的哥哥。
I'm trying to find my brother, your Uncle Wilfred.

361
00:32:06,816 --> 00:32:08,144
你的另一个叔叔，Wilfred
He's first butler to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

362
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:11,940
他是米兰加泊的马哈的管家。

363
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:14,940
可是米兰加泊是流动的。
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

364
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:17,233
它会在印度各个不同的地方。
It travels through India.

365
00:32:17,452 --> 00:32:19,194
我记得妈妈那时候有很多的明信片。
Oh, I remember Mom getting postcards.

366
00:32:19,412 --> 00:32:23,824
所以说威尔福来德是很难找到啊。
So Wilfred can be rather difficult to find.

367
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:27,574
我觉得他们不可能在大象身上还有传真机。
Well, I don't suppose they have fax machines on elephants.

368
00:32:29,173 --> 00:32:31,461
我一直想尽办法跟他联系，可惜都不行。
I've been trying to reach him with no success.

369
00:32:31,675 --> 00:32:34,165
当一个人开始老去，
When one grows ancient, one yearns for family.

370
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:37,801
他就更渴望拥有家人。

371
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:41,798
我在床头也有这张妈妈的照片。佩格？？
I have the same picture of Mom by my bed.

372
00:32:42,019 --> 00:32:44,972
哦，是我给玛格丽特起的小名。
Peg?

373
00:32:41,877 --> 00:32:44,421
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

374
00:32:47,317 --> 00:32:50,649
能重新见到你真好。
It's good to see you again.

375
00:32:50,862 --> 00:32:52,735
我一直都很想你。
I've missed you.

376
00:32:52,948 --> 00:32:56,113
我也很想你啊。
As I have you.

377
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:57,701
好好去睡觉吧，孩子。
Sleep well, child.

378
00:32:59,162 --> 00:33:00,739
你也睡吧。
You sleep.

379
00:33:02,582 --> 00:33:04,159
去睡。
Go to bed.

380
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:10,147
早上好，哥谭。
Good morning, Gotham.

381
00:34:10,362 --> 00:34:13,231
这里是闲话麦片节目向你早间报导
It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you direct from the Gotham Observatory...

382
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:15,737
直接从哥谭气象站发来的。。。。

383
00:34:15,952 --> 00:34:17,611
亿万富翁布鲁斯韦恩先生
...where billionaire Bruce Wayne, chairman of Wayne Enterprises...

384
00:34:17,829 --> 00:34:20,236
韦恩娱乐公司的总裁以及慈善家

385
00:34:20,457 --> 00:34:23,576
又有意将另一个传奇的捐赠
...is about to make yet another legendary contribution to the city.

386
00:34:23,793 --> 00:34:25,619
给哥谭镇。

387
00:34:25,837 --> 00:34:29,370
哥谭天文台，祸害。
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

388
00:34:29,591 --> 00:34:31,049
踩油门。
And step on it.

389
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:34,128
踩。
Step.

390
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:44,055
我爸爸曾经跟我说过
My father told me, "To succeed, we need only pick a star and follow it."

391
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:46,978
想要成功，我们只需要挑中一个明星，跟着他就好。

392
00:34:47,193 --> 00:34:49,398
所以，韦恩娱乐
So Wayne Enterprises is donating the world's most advanced telescope...

393
00:34:49,612 --> 00:34:52,481
就把世界上最先进的望远镜

394
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:55,699
捐给哥谭镇气象站，让他们去完成那个修复计划。
...to Gotham's Observatory Restoration Project.

395
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:59,112
如果运气好的话，这个望远镜能够给我们的下一代
With any luck...

396
00:34:56,845 --> 00:34:59,515
...this telescope will give future generations...

397
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,867
更好的机会去跟着那些明星。
...a chance to follow their own stars.

398
00:35:02,083 --> 00:35:04,655
【鼓掌】

399
00:35:04,879 --> 00:35:07,879
布鲁斯，这个望远镜真的可以
Brucy...

400
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:09,650
...is it true that this new telescope can see around the globe?

401
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:10,046
看到整个星球嘛？

402
00:35:10,259 --> 00:35:13,259
是的，只要你看着这些银幕。Lee博士？
Yes. If you'll watch these monitors right here. Doctor Lee?

403
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,711
卫星已经进入轨道，
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect light from anywhere on the planet.

404
00:35:15,932 --> 00:35:18,339
在星球周围的每一个点上反射光线。

405
00:35:18,559 --> 00:35:22,556
我们可以在地球的每一处看到天空。
From here, we'll be able to see the sky anywhere on Earth...

406
00:35:22,771 --> 00:35:25,343
当然是通过用这个复杂的卫星网络。
...and through this intricate network of satellites...

407
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:29,695
来把它反射到我们自己的哥谭镇。
...reflect it back to our very own Gotham City for observation.

408
00:35:29,905 --> 00:35:31,980
只是不要把他对准我的卧室。
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

409
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:34,487
【笑声】

410
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:40,157
布鲁斯，您和优雅的朱莉迈迪森。。。
Brucy, you and the exquisite Julie Madison...

411
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:42,200
总是在一起。
...have been going out forever.

412
00:35:42,417 --> 00:35:44,871
你们会真正把事情落实下来嘛？
Are you going to tie the knot?

413
00:35:45,087 --> 00:35:48,087
啊。结婚啊？ 阿。。。结婚？？？？
Uh, marriage?

414
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,396
Uh, uh, marriage?

415
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:50,540
你愿意帮我这个忙嘛？
You want to give me a hand here?

416
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,131
布鲁斯和我正在激烈的热恋中。
Bruce and I are recklessly in love.

417
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:56,180
而这个，很明显，我们已经很满足。至少是现在很满足。
And that's most certainly enough for us. For now.

418
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:57,801
哦。
If you will follow me, I'll show you the central control grid.

419
00:35:58,017 --> 00:36:01,219
跟我过来，我告诉你哪个是中心控制杆。

420
00:36:01,437 --> 00:36:03,678
你真帮了我一个大忙。
You're a lot of help.

421
00:36:04,983 --> 00:36:06,180
小姐，你站住。
Miss, you need to stop.

422
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,644
别挡着我的路，你们这些法西斯主义走狗。
Move, fascist bulldog!

423
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:10,018
如果要见伟恩先生的话你一定要预约。
- You need an appointment-- - No, I don't!

424
00:36:10,239 --> 00:36:12,907
小姐，你没有权力到这里来。
Miss, you're not authorized to be up here.

425
00:36:13,117 --> 00:36:14,824
先生，她连通行证都没有。
She has no pass, sir.

426
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:17,786
你不会伤害到我的，不是吗？小姐。
Little overly protective, but you won't hurt me, Miss--?

427
00:36:17,997 --> 00:36:19,277
叫我 帕美拉埃斯里博士。
Dr. Pamela Isley.

428
00:36:19,499 --> 00:36:22,415
博士，我能够为你作些什么呢？
Doctor...

429
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,264
...what can I do for you?

430
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:25,495
实际上，我为你工作。或者说，曾经为你工作过。
Actually, I already work for you, or did.

431
00:36:25,713 --> 00:36:27,870
不知你还记得那个在南美进行的乔木保存的项目吗？
Your arboreal preservation project in South America.

432
00:36:28,091 --> 00:36:29,501
我们减少了经费。
We cut our funding. There was a conflict of ideologies.

433
00:36:29,717 --> 00:36:31,958
因为我们在观念上有了分歧。

434
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:33,506
Woodrue博士是一个彻头彻尾的疯子。
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

435
00:36:33,722 --> 00:36:34,884
我想你认识他。
I see you knew him.

436
00:36:35,098 --> 00:36:37,173
是的，那个实验室在上个星期被烧成一片废墟。
Yes. That lab burnt down last week. I'm glad you escaped.

437
00:36:37,392 --> 00:36:39,467
我很高兴你能从那场事故中逃出来。

438
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:43,019
我这里有一份关于如何让韦恩娱乐
I have here a proposal showing how Wayne Enterprises can immediately...

439
00:36:43,232 --> 00:36:46,813
停止所有毒害我们环境的建议。
...cease all actions that toxify our environment.

440
00:36:47,027 --> 00:36:49,599
忘掉那些星星吧。仔细看看我们的地球。
Forget the stars, look here at the earth...

441
00:36:49,821 --> 00:36:51,314
我们的母亲，我们的发源地。
...our mother, our womb.

442
00:36:51,532 --> 00:36:54,651
她才真正值得我们去关心去保护。
She deserves your loyalty and protection.

443
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:58,070
可是，你们却损害了她的土地。
And yet, you spoil her lands...

444
00:36:58,289 --> 00:37:00,281
毒害海洋，污染天空。
...poison her oceans, blacken her skies!

445
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,622
你们正在把她杀掉。
You're killing her!

446
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:04,992
没错，你的目的非常的高尚。
Your intentions are noble, but no diesel fuel for heat...

447
00:37:05,213 --> 00:37:08,581
可是如果没有柴油机和燃料来发热 没有冷冻剂来帮助贮藏食物
...no coolants to preserve food...

448
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,420
数百万的人就会因为寒冷和 饥饿而孤独的死去
...millions of people would die of cold and hunger.

449
00:37:11,636 --> 00:37:14,340
可是这个是可以接受的 尤其是在这一场拯救星球的战役中。
Acceptable losses in the battle to save the planet.

450
00:37:14,555 --> 00:37:17,674
Isley博士，人类才是最重要的。
People come first, Dr. Isley.

451
00:37:19,229 --> 00:37:21,683
哺乳动物就是这样！！！
Mammals!

452
00:37:21,897 --> 00:37:25,229
总有一天老天会找你们算帐的！
A day of reckoning is coming.

453
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,826
That's right.

454
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:29,142
那些看着你们从原始泥塘中 爬行出来的植物和花朵
The same plants and flowers that saw you...

455
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:32,398
总有一天要从你们手里收回这个星球。
...crawl from the primordial soup...

456
00:37:30,999 --> 00:37:35,254
...will reclaim this planet and there will be no one to protect you!

457
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:35,403
到了那个时候，什么都保护不了你们。

458
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,573
【笑声】

459
00:37:38,789 --> 00:37:42,073
你，你一定是新来的吧？
You....

460
00:37:39,341 --> 00:37:41,468
You must be new in town.

461
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:45,662
难道你都不知道在哥谭镇，是蝙蝠侠和洛宾在保护我们？
In Gotham City, Batman and Robin protect us...

462
00:37:45,881 --> 00:37:48,252
哪怕是植物和花朵要侵犯我们。
...even from plants and flowers.

463
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:51,301
【笑声】

464
00:37:51,512 --> 00:37:53,919
或许你想认识认识他们？博士。
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

465
00:37:54,139 --> 00:37:55,632
那些戴帽子的十字军也会帮助我们
Caped crusaders are going to help us auction...

466
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,758
把那些值钱的钻石的价格太高在拍卖出去
...a diamond to raise money for our botanical gardens.

467
00:37:57,976 --> 00:38:00,217
这样就可以建设我们哥谭镇的植物园了。

468
00:38:00,437 --> 00:38:02,345
只有少数的哺乳动物才会力所能及的
Just a few mammals doing what we can for the world's plants.

469
00:38:02,564 --> 00:38:03,974
为这个世界上的植物做一点事情。

470
00:38:04,192 --> 00:38:07,441
对你们的到来表示深切的谢意。博士，也祝你有美好的一天。
Thank you all for coming.

471
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,160
Good day, doctor.

472
00:38:07,654 --> 00:38:09,942
【鼓掌】

473
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:19,450
蝙蝠侠和洛宾。。。
Batman and Robin...

474
00:38:19,666 --> 00:38:23,710
热血动物压迫者的爪牙。
...militant arm of the warm-blooded oppressors...

475
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:28,582
维持现状的动物保护者。
...animal protectors of the status quo.

476
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:31,754
首先，我要把自己
First...

477
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:33,562
...I'll rid myself of the fur and feathered pests.

478
00:38:31,971 --> 00:38:35,090
从这些长着皮毛的害虫里摆脱出来。

479
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:41,595
然后，整个哥谭镇就会因为变绿而成为我的。
And then Gotham...

480
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,525
...will be mine...

481
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,485
...for the greening.

482
00:39:01,585 --> 00:39:03,244
打扰一下，头儿
Uh, excuse me, chief.

483
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:06,415
我这有些东西你应该会觉得有用。
I got something here you might want to see.

484
00:39:13,098 --> 00:39:16,263
我讨厌我在看这个片子的时候别人打扰。
I hate when people talk during the movie.

485
00:39:35,246 --> 00:39:38,495
再要一个钻石，我的爱。
One more diamond, my love.

486
00:39:38,708 --> 00:39:40,498
再要一个。
One more.

487
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:49,967
布鲁斯韦恩钻石。恩。。
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds." Hmm.

488
00:39:52,138 --> 00:39:54,545
太好了。
Very nice.

489
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,050
【打鼓声】

490
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:09,353
【口哨声】

491
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:10,983
【大象鸣叫】

492
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,990
【打鼓声】

493
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:21,200
【音乐声】

494
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,794
【大象鸣叫】

495
00:40:36,018 --> 00:40:38,140
哇！

496
00:40:38,354 --> 00:40:41,437
女士们先生们。
Ladies and gentlemen...

497
00:40:41,649 --> 00:40:44,933
早间节目的闲聊麦片
...Gossip Gerty of Good Morning Gotham and I...

498
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:50,147
欢迎你们来到黑夜珍宝。
...welcome you to the gem of the evening.

499
00:40:50,367 --> 00:40:52,572
我们的哥登专员
Our own Commissioner Gordon...

500
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:57,197
为大家展示这件著名的彩虹女神之心。
...displaying the famed Heart of Isis, on loan...

501
00:40:57,415 --> 00:40:59,288
它来自我一位亲密友人的私人收藏，
...from the collection of my close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

502
00:40:59,501 --> 00:41:05,206
这个人就是布鲁斯韦恩。啊哈。

503
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:08,340
你觉得急冻人会上钩吗？
- Think Freeze will take the bait? - He'll be here.

504
00:41:08,552 --> 00:41:10,045
他一定会来的。
--to dance with one of our fabulous flowers...

505
00:41:10,263 --> 00:41:13,382
跟我们这儿其中最美丽的一朵花跳起舞吧。

506
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,097
那颗著名的钻石就佩戴在她的脖子上。

507
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:22,017
让我们开始竞价吧。

514
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:39,244
【欢呼】

515
00:41:42,421 --> 00:41:43,701
来吧，
Boys, please...

516
00:41:43,922 --> 00:41:45,830
让我们表露出我们有多么的欢畅。

517
00:41:46,050 --> 00:41:48,172
哈哈哈哈。

518

【激烈的音乐】

519
00:42:57,418 --> 00:42:59,659
喔！！

520
00:43:15,185 --> 00:43:17,307
喔！！

521
00:43:53,017 --> 00:43:54,925
嗨！
Hi there.

522
00:43:55,144 --> 00:43:57,468
请问你是？？
And you are?

523
00:43:57,689 --> 00:43:59,431
毒药！
Poison...

524
00:43:59,649 --> 00:44:00,977
有毒的常春藤。
...Poison Ivy.

525
00:44:01,192 --> 00:44:03,480
啊。。

526
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,614
嗯。。。
Mmm.

527
00:44:11,828 --> 00:44:14,911
为什么不把这个年轻人早些送回家去？
Why not send junior home early?

528
00:44:15,124 --> 00:44:19,666
我这儿有更多更野性的。
I've got some wild oats to sow.

529
00:44:19,878 --> 00:44:22,202
不过呢，
On the other hand...

530
00:44:22,423 --> 00:44:25,625
年轻的确是有优势。
...youth does have its advantages.

531
00:44:25,843 --> 00:44:29,791
忍耐力，持久力。。。

532
00:44:30,015 --> 00:44:32,172
把那只衰老的蝙蝠忘掉吧。
Forget the geriatric bat.

533
00:44:32,392 --> 00:44:33,933
来跟我在一起吧。
Come, join me.

534
00:44:34,144 --> 00:44:36,634
我的花园需要有人来管理。
My garden needs tending.

535
00:44:36,855 --> 00:44:38,229
我要在这儿选个人，朋友。
I'll take it from here, pal.

536
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,930
难道你 也喜欢这项链吗？
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

537
00:44:41,151 --> 00:44:45,647
有些幸运的人将会打中这个蜜糖罐。
Some lucky boy's about to hit the honey pot.

538
00:44:45,864 --> 00:44:50,442

541
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,123

542
00:44:58,336 --> 00:45:01,917
我给她出价五万美金。

543
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:04,170

00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:06,042
我出10万。

545
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:07,589
【鼓掌】
And I'll bid...

546
00:45:07,803 --> 00:45:12,963
那我出50万。

547
00:45:13,185 --> 00:45:14,215
【欢呼】
One million dollars.

548
00:45:14,436 --> 00:45:15,846
我出一百万。

549
00:45:16,731 --> 00:45:18,059
我出两百万。
- Two million. - You don't have it. Three million.

550
00:45:18,274 --> 00:45:19,981
你根本没有钱。我出三百万。
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

551
00:45:20,192 --> 00:45:22,100
我可以从你那儿借。四百万。

552
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:23,777
五百万。
- Five million. - That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

553
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:25,777
那是个有用的腰带，不是钱带。六百万。
- Six million. - Seven million.

554
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,567
七百万。

555
00:45:28,701 --> 00:45:30,657
【惊讶声】

556
00:45:30,870 --> 00:45:32,150
从不放弃。
Never leave the cave without it.

557
00:45:32,747 --> 00:45:34,205
你俩该不会为了我
You boys aren't going to start fighting over little me, now, are you?

558
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,372
打起来了吧？

559
00:45:39,379 --> 00:45:41,833
【尖叫】

560
00:45:42,049 --> 00:45:44,290
啊！

561
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,300
【尖叫】

562
00:45:46,511 --> 00:45:48,586
啊!

563
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:52,389
好了。各位，冷冻！
All right, everyone! Chill.

564
00:45:53,143 --> 00:45:54,601
冷冻！
Chill. Chill.

565
00:45:55,270 --> 00:45:56,598
冷冻！

566
00:45:56,815 --> 00:45:59,139
啊！

567
00:46:01,861 --> 00:46:04,861
啊！拿上枪！
Get the gun!

568
00:46:06,366 --> 00:46:07,610
啊！

哈？

570
00:46:31,684 --> 00:46:32,881
耶！
Yeah.

571
00:46:41,652 --> 00:46:43,193
嘣！
Boo.

572
00:46:47,367 --> 00:46:48,445
啊
Look at you!

573
00:46:48,661 --> 00:46:50,119
啊！看看你们！
Let me guess.

574
00:46:50,329 --> 00:46:54,112
让我猜猜看，植物女？

575
00:46:52,644 --> 00:46:53,895
Plant Girl?

576
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,206
蔓藤女士，是吗？
Vine Lady?

577
00:46:56,419 --> 00:46:58,790
把钻石递过来，花园女郎。
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal...

578
00:46:59,004 --> 00:47:01,672
不然我就把你用冰封起来。
...or I'll turn you into mulch.

579
00:47:06,513 --> 00:47:07,793
生化粉尘。
Pheromone dust...

580
00:47:08,015 --> 00:47:11,180
专门为家人男人的血液而设计的。
...designed to heat a man's blood.

581
00:47:11,392 --> 00:47:13,218
但是对我急冻人是没用的。
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted. If you please!

582
00:47:13,436 --> 00:47:14,384
现在，请给我吧。

583
00:47:14,604 --> 00:47:17,604
如果你一定坚持要。
If you insist.

584
00:47:18,983 --> 00:47:23,728
嗯，聪明的三叶草。

585
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:23,341
Clever little clover.

586
00:47:24,281 --> 00:47:25,027
【惊讶】
Whoa!

587
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:30,115
啊。这是我的出口。

588
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,597
That's my exit cue.

589
00:47:30,329 --> 00:47:32,119
谢谢!
Thanks.

590
00:47:43,092 --> 00:47:44,965
晚安！
Good night.

591
00:47:46,012 --> 00:47:47,553
错的派对！
Cool party!

592
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:50,550
呵呵！

593
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,476
呵呵！

594
00:48:15,376 --> 00:48:19,207
专员，你有11分钟的时间来给这些人解冻。
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes to thaw these people.

595
00:48:25,053 --> 00:48:26,795
小姐，你刚刚遇到了
Miss Ivy, you've just met one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

596
00:48:27,013 --> 00:48:29,301
哥谭最险恶的人之一

597
00:48:29,516 --> 00:48:31,472
他根本就不是人。
That's not a man...

598
00:48:31,685 --> 00:48:33,890
他是神。
...that is a god.

599
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:39,859
啊。。
Enough monkey business.

600
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:42,441
不用在装扮成猩猩了。

601
00:48:42,655 --> 00:48:44,362
我们有更重要的事情要做。
We've got work to do.

602
00:48:44,574 --> 00:48:45,569
【祸害的叫声】
Monkey work.

603
00:48:45,783 --> 00:48:48,320
有工作了

604
00:49:03,928 --> 00:49:05,836
【笑声】

605
00:49:08,432 --> 00:49:10,554
【汽笛声】

606
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:13,184
【汽笛声】

607
00:49:37,671 --> 00:49:39,295
刹车，你根本不可能跳过去。
- Pull back. You can't make the jump. - I can make it!

608
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:40,881
我能跳过去。

609
00:49:43,428 --> 00:49:45,752
刹车。我能跳！
- Pull back! - I can make it!

610
00:49:45,972 --> 00:49:47,300
红雀控制代码。
Redbird control codes.

611
00:49:47,516 --> 00:49:50,220
【迪迪声】

612
00:49:50,435 --> 00:49:51,597
关闭引擎
Disable engine.

613
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:54,765
不！不！你不能对我这样！
No! Don't do this to me!

614
00:49:54,982 --> 00:49:56,392
不！
No!

615
00:50:01,821 --> 00:50:03,065
【咕噜声】
We won't make it!

616
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:04,692
我们这样不行。

617
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,371
啊！

618
00:50:14,585 --> 00:50:16,909
啊！

619
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:29,471
真是个冰冷的城市。
It's a cold town.

620
00:50:29,685 --> 00:50:31,677
哈哈哈哈哈

621
00:50:41,989 --> 00:50:45,024
哈哈哈哈
Uh-oh.

622
00:51:01,051 --> 00:51:02,461
我本来一定可以跳过去的。
I could've made that jump.

623
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:05,298
你本来已经把你的脑浆泼溅在那座大楼上。
You could've splattered your brains on the building's side.

624
00:51:05,513 --> 00:51:07,303
在马戏团，大家都是团队工作。
The Flying Graysons were a team.

625
00:51:07,516 --> 00:51:09,673
我们必须信任每一个人才能完成我们的工作。
We had to trust each person to do his job.

626
00:51:09,893 --> 00:51:11,801
那样才是成为拍档的真正涵义。
That's what being partners is about.

627
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:14,592
有些时候，只有跟其他人合作才是你的唯一生路。
Counting on someone is the way to win.

628
00:51:14,816 --> 00:51:16,891
你那个时候满脑子想的都是那个毒药爱维。
Your head wasn't on the job. It was on Poison Ivy.

629
00:51:17,109 --> 00:51:19,860
你只是无法忍受她喜欢我而不是你。
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

630
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:21,778
那就是你所谓的友谊是吗，布鲁斯？
That's your idea of friendship?

631
00:51:21,989 --> 00:51:24,989
你的房子，你的规则，你的方式？
It's your rules. It's your way, or the highway.

632
00:51:25,201 --> 00:51:28,450
永远都是蝙蝠侠和洛宾 而不是洛宾和蝙蝠侠
It's Batman and Robin, not Robin and Batman.

633
00:51:28,663 --> 00:51:31,235
没错，我的规则让我们大家都活下来。
- I'm sick of it! - Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

634
00:51:31,458 --> 00:51:33,746
而且如果你要留在这个房子里，成为这个团队的一员
If you want to stay in this house, on this team, you'll abide by them.

635
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,501
你就必须遵守这些规则。
This is no partnership.

636
00:51:35,713 --> 00:51:37,123
这根本就不是拍档。
You're never going to trust me!

637
00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:40,374
你也永远都不会相信我。

638
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:47,344
亲爱的Welfred哥哥
Dear brother Wilfred...

639
00:51:47,558 --> 00:51:51,970
我尝试各种办法找你。
...I have tried every address I know for you.

640
00:51:52,188 --> 00:51:54,760
我现在只能祈祷这个或许能够和你取得联系。
I'm just praying this reaches you.

641
00:51:54,982 --> 00:51:57,187
我们的时间都不多了。
We have very little time.

642
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:11,411
【敲门声】

643
00:52:12,042 --> 00:52:13,204
嗨！
Batman monopolized the evening news.

644
00:52:13,418 --> 00:52:16,833
蝙蝠侠简直独占了晚间新闻，

645
00:52:17,047 --> 00:52:18,375
啊，是吗
Huh. Yes.

646
00:52:18,591 --> 00:52:20,962
恭喜你终于抓住了急冻人。
Congratulations on your apprehension of Mr. Freeze.

647
00:52:21,177 --> 00:52:23,252
谢谢。谢谢你。
Thanks. Thank you.

648
00:52:25,681 --> 00:52:27,838
有什么不对劲么，先生？
Is there something wrong, sir?

649
00:52:28,893 --> 00:52:32,474
Alfred，我是一个很顽固的人吗？
Alfred...

650
00:52:30,606 --> 00:52:32,191
...am I pig-headed?

651
00:52:32,689 --> 00:52:34,099
是不是？
Is it...?

652
00:52:35,442 --> 00:52:38,975
是不是我总是强用我自己的方式？
Is it always...

653
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:38,614
...my way or the highway?

654
00:52:39,196 --> 00:52:42,315
为什么这么问？ 不过，实际上就是那么回事。
Why, yes. Actually.

655
00:52:42,532 --> 00:52:45,200
死亡和偶然抢走了你的双亲。
Death and chance stole your parents...

656
00:52:45,411 --> 00:52:47,818
在你没有成为牺牲品，
...but rather than become a victim...

657
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,790
你已经做了你能做到的一切
...you have done everything in your power to control the fates.

658
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:52,374
来掌握命运。

659
00:52:52,585 --> 00:52:56,249
并不是蝙蝠侠努力要
For what is Batman...

660
00:52:56,464 --> 00:53:00,508
掌管和清理这个混乱的世界
...if not an effort to master the chaos that sweeps our world?

661
00:53:00,718 --> 00:53:04,846
而是努力去控制死亡。
An attempt to control...

662
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,265
...death itself?

663
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:26,740
可是我不行，不是吗？
But I can't, can I?

664
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:30,742
任何人都不行。
None of us can.

665
00:53:49,978 --> 00:53:51,352
嗨！
Hey!

666
00:53:51,564 --> 00:53:53,603
嗨！
Hyah!

667
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,224
哦，对不起。
Sorry. Um, so sorry!

668
00:53:56,444 --> 00:53:57,688
唔，，真的很对不起！
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

669
00:53:57,904 --> 00:53:59,232
你从牛津剑桥学的？
Just a few judo lessons. You know, London's kind of rough.

670
00:53:59,447 --> 00:54:01,854
只是一些柔道课程罢了。

671
00:54:02,075 --> 00:54:03,901
伦敦是个粗糙的地方。

672
00:54:04,118 --> 00:54:06,655
我想你还学习了怎么骑摩托车是吧？
I suppose you had a minor in motorbikes also?

673
00:54:06,871 --> 00:54:10,239
哦，我实在没有办法抗拒。

674
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,498
Couldn't resist.

675
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:13,078
我是说，它实在是太漂亮了。
It's just so beautiful.

676
00:54:13,294 --> 00:54:15,167
我只是骑着他兜了个小圈。
I just took it out for a spin. I'll clean it tomorrow.

677
00:54:15,381 --> 00:54:17,622
我明天早上把它擦干净可以吗？
All right? Sorry.

678
00:54:17,842 --> 00:54:20,083
对不起。对不起。
Um, sorry. Good night.

679
00:54:20,302 --> 00:54:22,341
晚安。

680
00:54:28,560 --> 00:54:30,635
【雷声】

681
00:55:06,935 --> 00:55:09,507
把他拉到冷冻区域。
Drag him into the cold beam.

682
00:55:11,064 --> 00:55:12,806
欢迎回到家来，急冻人。
Welcome home, Frost Face.

683
00:55:13,024 --> 00:55:15,596
你只是一般冷而已，我们来修理你。
You're the common cold, and we are the cure.

684
00:55:15,818 --> 00:55:17,062
啊。

685
00:55:18,238 --> 00:55:20,989
请允许我把冰打烂。
Allow me to break the ice.

686
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,405
我的名字叫冷冻。
My name is Freeze.

687
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:25,278
好好学会它。
Learn it well...

688
00:55:25,496 --> 00:55:27,903
因为这是你们毁灭时候的声音。
...for it's the chilling sound of your doom.

689
00:55:28,123 --> 00:55:29,830
【雷声】

690
00:55:33,671 --> 00:55:34,619
啊！

691
00:55:34,839 --> 00:55:37,210
呃，呃！

692
00:55:39,051 --> 00:55:41,671
好吧，急冻人，
All right, Freezie, you can't live outside the cold zone.

693
00:55:41,888 --> 00:55:44,639
你根本就不可能在冰冻区域以外的地方生存。

694
00:55:44,849 --> 00:55:46,129
啊！

695
00:55:46,352 --> 00:55:48,178
【保安的笑声】

696
00:55:48,395 --> 00:55:50,600
【哽咽】

697
00:55:56,361 --> 00:56:00,025
看看他那个样子。
Look at him stew.

698
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,030
好好习惯一下吧。
Get used to it.

699
00:56:02,243 --> 00:56:06,703
你会在这儿呆上好些日子呢。
You're going to be here a very long, long time.

700
00:56:06,915 --> 00:56:12,335
可是非常抱歉，你们根本不可能活着见到。
Sadly...

701
00:56:09,533 --> 00:56:11,952
...you will not live to see it.

702
00:56:12,545 --> 00:56:15,628
【保安的笑声】

703
00:56:19,719 --> 00:56:21,627
哦。是的。
Oh, yes.

704
00:56:23,727 --> 00:56:24,720
蝙蝠脸，鸟雀的脑子。
Batface and Birdbrain turned out to be much more...

705
00:56:24,935 --> 00:56:27,386
好像对我的药物

706
00:56:27,601 --> 00:56:29,673
比想象中更有抵抗力。
...resistant to my love dust than expected.

707
00:56:29,893 --> 00:56:31,349
不要紧。
No matter. Next time I'll just give them a stronger dose.

708
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:34,092
下一次，我只需要给他们更强的剂量就可以。

709
00:56:34,309 --> 00:56:37,388
理论上他们能为了我去死！
They'll literally be dying for me.

710
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,300
嗯，土耳其沐浴。
Hmm. "Turkish baths."

711
00:56:40,516 --> 00:56:42,303
这个看起来有前途。
This looks promising.

712
00:56:45,431 --> 00:56:48,296
呃！

713
00:56:49,431 --> 00:56:51,585
【笑声】

714
00:56:54,056 --> 00:56:55,428
【木头裂碎声】

715
00:56:55,639 --> 00:56:58,837
呃！

716
00:56:59,055 --> 00:57:01,257
呃！

717
00:57:07,886 --> 00:57:11,462
蓿很乱嘛！
Hmm.

718
00:57:10,094 --> 00:57:11,929
A fixer-upper.

719
00:57:11,676 --> 00:57:14,376
不过还算有一种家庭式的吸引力。
But with a certain homey charm.

720
00:57:14,594 --> 00:57:17,459
啊，少算了一个
Ah. A minus!

721
00:57:17,677 --> 00:57:19,500
现在的住客
Current tenants.

722
00:57:19,717 --> 00:57:22,796
你好，我的小美人。
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

723
00:57:23,008 --> 00:57:24,630
你好。
Hello yourself.

724
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:26,747
你看起来味道不错。
You look good enough to eat.

725
00:57:26,967 --> 00:57:29,797
其实我就是。
That I am.

726
00:57:30,008 --> 00:57:33,501
过来抓我吧，如果你能行的话。
Come and get me, if you can.

727
00:57:33,715 --> 00:57:35,290
呃！

728
00:57:35,506 --> 00:57:37,660
十分荣幸。
With pleasure.

729
00:57:44,005 --> 00:57:45,247
呃！

730
00:57:51,295 --> 00:57:52,870
呃！

731
00:57:55,628 --> 00:57:56,954

884
01:08:53,479 --> 01:08:55,222
你可以畅所欲言.
You can speak freely.

885
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,818
我根本就不介意你们.
I don't mind you at all.

886
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:08,653
男人--上帝最可笑的创造.
Men...

887
01:09:06,017 --> 01:09:08,645
...the most absurd of God's creatures.

888
01:09:08,869 --> 01:09:09,983
我们赐予你们生命...
We give you life...

889
01:09:10,204 --> 01:09:13,869
我们也能同样轻易的夺走.
...and we can take it away just as easily.

890
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,114
对.
- Right! - Whatever.

891
01:09:15,334 --> 01:09:17,125
当然. Ha ha ha ha ha!

892
01:09:17,336 --> 01:09:21,001
我真的要死了.
I really am to die for.

[Guard choking]

894
01:09:27,388 --> 01:09:29,179
Hmm.

Aah!

FREEZE: 真让我感动.
Impressive!

我最可爱的雪人...
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman...

898
01:09:55,333 --> 01:09:57,705
我已经被你打动了.
...have been impressed by you.

899
01:09:57,919 --> 01:10:01,537
实际上,我建议我们结成一对.
In fact...

900
01:09:59,446 --> 01:10:01,907
...I propose a pairing.

我是来救你出去的.
I've come to set you free.

905
01:10:13,894 --> 01:10:16,978
一个诱人的提议...
An enticing offer...

906
01:10:17,189 --> 01:10:20,973
但这位小姐想得到什么回报呢?
...but what does the lady want in return?

907
01:10:22,778 --> 01:10:24,438
先把这个放一边.
Let's cool it for now. I've got someone I want you to meet.

908
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,980
有个人我希望你见见他.

[Buzzes]

910
01:10:30,828 --> 01:10:32,820
Grrr!

911
01:10:34,457 --> 01:10:36,698
他叫Bane.
His name is Bane.

912
01:10:36,918 --> 01:10:40,785
洗衣店把衣服送来了. Wow!
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

913
01:10:41,005 --> 01:10:42,203
快离开那!

914
01:10:42,423 --> 01:10:43,917
出来!

915
01:10:45,385 --> 01:10:48,635
你是什么尺寸, 50 码的大小?
What are you, about a 50, big and tall?

916
01:10:48,846 --> 01:10:50,637
不,我一般穿小点的.
No, I always go a size smaller. Makes me look slimmer.

917
01:10:50,848 --> 01:10:53,802
这让我看起来苗条些.

918
01:10:55,437 --> 01:10:56,468
[Beeping]

919
01:10:56,688 --> 01:10:59,854
我的能量快用完了.

920
01:10:58,338 --> 01:10:59,923
I'm running on empty.

921
01:11:00,066 --> 01:11:01,346
我要去我藏身的地方拿钻石.
I need the diamonds.

922
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:04,023
我会帮你夺回你的钻石.
I'll help you grab your rocks.

923
01:11:07,032 --> 01:11:08,277
Bane!
Bane, dear...

924
01:11:08,492 --> 01:11:11,825
亲爱的,弄个出口.

925
01:11:10,016 --> 01:11:11,726
...an exit, please.

加固的钢铁.
Reinforced steel.

928
01:11:18,794 --> 01:11:20,620
不太妙.
Not good.

01:11:26,718 --> 01:11:28,093
Oh, yeah.

930
01:11:31,348 --> 01:11:34,847
一定要给水管装上防冻设备.
Always winterize your pipes.

931
01:11:41,609 --> 01:11:43,067
Ohh!

932
01:11:47,865 --> 01:11:49,193
快!

933
01:11:49,408 --> 01:11:51,400
我去拿钻石...
While I get my diamonds, you and meatloaf retrieve my wife.

934
01:11:51,619 --> 01:11:53,658
你和Meatloaf去救我妻子.

935
01:11:53,871 --> 01:11:55,780
你从没说过你有妻子!
- You never mentioned a wife! - Come on.

936
01:11:55,998 --> 01:11:59,449
来吧!我希望Bane先生会游泳.

937
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,399
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.

[Gunshot]

943
01:12:16,811 --> 01:12:20,014
Alfred,你还好吗?
Alfred, are you well?

944
01:12:20,231 --> 01:12:23,185
好得不能再好了,先生.
As well as can be expected, sir.

945
01:12:24,110 --> 01:12:26,149
我的朋友,我知道你病了.
My friend, I know you're sick.

946
01:12:26,363 --> 01:12:28,106
我为你找了最好的医生.
I can get you the best doctors.

947
01:12:28,323 --> 01:12:31,407
我已经去找过最好的医生了.
I have seen the best doctors.

948
01:12:31,618 --> 01:12:33,610
一个绅士不会喋喋不休讲他的疾病.
A gentleman does not discuss his ailments. It is not civilized.

949
01:12:33,829 --> 01:12:35,738
那不礼貌.

950
01:12:35,956 --> 01:12:37,699
我希望我教过你...
I hope that I have taught you at least that much, Master Bruce.

...have you ever...

遗憾过在这工作吗?
...regretted your life working here?

955
01:12:48,761 --> 01:12:50,634
照顾英雄?
Looking after heroes?

956
01:12:50,846 --> 01:12:51,960
不.先生.
No, sir.

957
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:54,932
我唯一的遗憾就是我永远不能...
My only regret is that I was never able to be out there with you.

958
01:12:55,142 --> 01:12:57,549
和你一起出去.

959
01:13:00,815 --> 01:13:03,388
并不是所有的英雄都戴着面具的.
Not all the heroes wear masks.

960
01:13:07,238 --> 01:13:08,898
冰冻人跑了.
Freeze has escaped!

961
01:13:22,503 --> 01:13:25,420
这是我们从Arkham的监视器上取下来的.
We got this off the Arkham surveillance camera.

962
01:13:28,176 --> 01:13:29,836
毒藤女lvy.
Poison Ivy.

963
01:13:30,970 --> 01:13:32,796
两天前,纽约机场...
Two nights ago...

964
01:13:33,014 --> 01:13:36,347
这两人从南美包机来的.
...Gotham Airport, these two arrive by charter from South America.

965
01:13:36,559 --> 01:13:39,974
他们打伤了10名保安...
They put 10 security guards in the hospital...

还用有机毒药杀死了一个商人...
...left a businessman dead from organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

并偷了他的豪华轿车.

01:13:44,734 --> 01:13:47,984
明显是这两人干的.
This is definitely the same pair that sprang Freeze.

969
01:13:48,196 --> 01:13:51,280
-Gordon局长? -嗯.失陪了,先生们.
- Commissioner Gordon. - Excuse me, gentlemen.

970
01:13:51,491 --> 01:13:54,064
毒藤女lvy--为什么她要帮冰冻人逃跑?
Poison Ivy, why would she help Freeze escape?

971
01:13:54,286 --> 01:13:56,278
她确实很邪恶,真是让人难以置信.
She's definitely evil.

972
01:13:56,497 --> 01:13:59,070
我曾经为她神魂颠倒.
She was all I could think about, like I was in love, but--

973
01:13:59,291 --> 01:14:01,829
我了解,然后这种感觉突然消失了.
I know, then the feeling vanished.

974
01:14:02,044 --> 01:14:04,036
难以相信我们要迎战一个坏家伙(guy).
I can't believe we fought over a bad guy.

975
01:14:04,254 --> 01:14:06,495
坏是坏,男人(guy)却不是.
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

976
01:14:06,715 --> 01:14:08,506
我已经完全摆脱她了,对吗? 肯定.
Well, I'm totally over her.

01:14:08,717 --> 01:14:11,124

-虽然着迷比较深. -我也是.
- Great stems, though. - Buds too.

她还活着.
She's still alive.

他采用他的冰冻技术
He adapted his freezing technology to reverse the disease.

985
01:14:41,876 --> 01:14:43,667
来延缓Macgregor综合症.

986
01:14:43,878 --> 01:14:46,119
他已经找到了治疗这种病某些时期的方法.
He even found a cure for the disease in some stages.

987
01:14:46,339 --> 01:14:48,165
她在那.
There she is.

988
01:14:48,383 --> 01:14:51,752
你去拿钻石,我去救你的白雪公主.
Get the diamonds. I'll rescue your bride.

989
01:14:51,970 --> 01:14:54,176
在我那里碰头.
We'll meet back at my place.

990
01:14:54,389 --> 01:14:56,512
不行.我现在太虚弱了...
No. In my weakened condition, I'm no match for the bat and bird.

991
01:14:56,725 --> 01:14:58,764
打不过他们.

992
01:14:58,977 --> 01:15:01,550
我来搞定这些家伙.
You leave those boys to me.

993
01:15:01,772 --> 01:15:04,607
走!
Go!

994
01:15:04,816 --> 01:15:06,274
他能救她吗?
- Can he save her? - Her case is too advanced.

995
01:15:06,485 --> 01:15:08,109
她的病已经到晚期了...

996
01:15:08,320 --> 01:15:11,439
但也许有一天,经过更多的研究...
But maybe someday...

997
01:15:09,964 --> 01:15:11,591
...with more research....

我讨厌不速之客.
I hate uninvited guests.

01:15:33,596 --> 01:15:36,003
-Hey,什么-- -小心!

我的肺冻住了!
My lungs are freezing!

[Coughing]

1005
01:15:50,071 --> 01:15:52,312
Ahh...

完美的冰冻!
Chilled to perfection.

1007
01:15:55,577 --> 01:15:58,946
Ahh...那里.

1008
01:16:02,500 --> 01:16:03,745
没有美女.
No beauty.

1009
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,917
Grrr!

1010
01:16:06,129 --> 01:16:08,205
只有野兽.
Just the beast.

Grrr! Grrr!

Grrr!

这边,可爱的小家伙.
Hey, there, pretty birdie.

1016
01:16:30,445 --> 01:16:32,271
投降吧.如果你投降...
Give yourself up. If you surrender--

1017
01:16:32,489 --> 01:16:33,899
向你?
To you?

1018
01:16:35,868 --> 01:16:37,741
想来个吻吗?
Polly want a kiss?

1019
01:16:37,953 --> 01:16:39,411
Grrr!

1020
01:16:46,837 --> 01:16:49,588
Grrr!

这位穿着..
There's something about an anatomically correct...

结构完美的橡皮衣的英雄...

1023
01:16:55,930 --> 01:16:59,096
真是让一个女孩忍不住要去吻一下.
...rubber suit that puts fire in a girl's lips.

1024
01:17:02,270 --> 01:17:05,436
为什么外表美丽的人都心如蛇蝎?说我吗?
Why are all the gorgeous ones homicidal maniacs? Is it me?

1025
01:17:05,648 --> 01:17:08,435
甜言蜜语已经说够了.
Enough sweet talk.

1026
01:17:08,651 --> 01:17:10,690
Oh, 不!
Oh, no.

1027
01:17:10,903 --> 01:17:13,109
首先,你要告诉我冰冻人在哪里...
First you'll tell me where Freeze is, then you're going to jail.

1028
01:17:13,323 --> 01:17:15,066
然后你将被关进监狱.

1029
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:20,743
我是一个情人,可不是一个战士.
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

1030
01:17:20,955 --> 01:17:24,039
所以每次毒藤女lvy行动都要带上他.
That's why every Poison Ivy Action Figure comes with him!

1031
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,207
Ha ha ha ha!

你死的时候可不要屁滚尿流.

01:17:54,740 --> 01:17:57,859
伙计们,快!上那去!

1036
01:17:58,077 --> 01:18:01,243
是的,是的.

1037
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:01,094
Yes, yes.

1038
01:18:01,455 --> 01:18:02,534
不许动!
Hold it right there!

1039
01:18:02,748 --> 01:18:03,613
那边!

1040
01:18:03,833 --> 01:18:05,706
-快! -那边!

1041
01:18:24,562 --> 01:18:26,186
住手!
Stop!

1042
01:18:28,149 --> 01:18:31,731
活在那只大蝙蝠的阴影之下?
Living in the shadow of the big, bad bat.

1043
01:18:31,945 --> 01:18:34,566
你不需要他.
You don't need him.

1044
01:18:34,781 --> 01:18:36,773
你就是明星.
You're the star.

1045
01:18:36,991 --> 01:18:38,948
我现在就能看到.
I can see it now:

1046
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:43,786
你在天空中有一个又大又明亮的标志.
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.

1047
01:18:43,999 --> 01:18:45,742
让我来指引你.
Let me guide you.

1048
01:18:45,959 --> 01:18:47,832
Grrr!

1049
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:52,587
BOhh...

1050
01:18:53,759 --> 01:18:56,428
让我吻你一下.
Let me kiss you.

1051
01:18:56,637 --> 01:18:59,044
停下来! 不要吻她. 机场的受害者--
Stop! Don't kiss her.

1052
01:18:59,264 --> 01:19:01,137
就是由嘴唇中毒的.
The victim at the airport, toxins introduced orally.

1053
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,808
你在说什么?
- What are you saying? - Why does she want to kiss us?

1054
01:19:03,018 --> 01:19:05,259
你为什么不想想她为什么想方设法要吻我们?

1055
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:06,724
毒吻?
- I bet her lips are poisoned. - Poisoned kiss?

1056
01:19:06,939 --> 01:19:08,682
你对女人的看法有问题.
You have issues with women!

1057
01:19:08,899 --> 01:19:11,140
你不能忍受她吻我而不是吻你.
You can't stand that she'd kiss me and not you.

1058
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:13,851
不能忍受有东西属于我却不属于你.
Something would be mine, not yours.

1059
01:19:21,579 --> 01:19:25,030
Ha ha! 出去吧, Bane.

1060
01:19:25,249 --> 01:19:28,748
出去. Rrrr.
Exit, Bane.

1061
01:19:25,803 --> 01:19:27,346
Exit!

1062
01:19:38,179 --> 01:19:40,883
lvy是对的,我不需要你的帮助.
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

1063
01:19:43,059 --> 01:19:45,016
我以后独来独往.
I'm going solo!

1064
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,516
怎么回事? 他们怎么逃跑了?
What happened? How'd they get away?

1065
01:20:07,751 --> 01:20:11,202
我从来都不擅长竞争.
I've never been good with competition.

1066
01:20:12,756 --> 01:20:16,374
谁会需要一个冰冷的妻子呢?
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

1067
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:39,814
哼!

1068
01:20:40,034 --> 01:20:43,034
你应该在场就好了.
Make yourself right at home.

1069
01:20:45,206 --> 01:20:46,285
我妻子呢?
Where's my wife?

1070
01:20:46,499 --> 01:20:48,290
我无能为力.
There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her.

1071
01:20:48,501 --> 01:20:51,252
蝙蝠侠拔了她的装置,她死了.

1072
01:20:51,462 --> 01:20:52,790
你撒谎!
- She's dead. - You lie!

1073
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:59,169
Oh, 没有.
Oh, no.

1074
01:21:11,816 --> 01:21:13,310
[Cracking]

1075
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:19,444
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1076
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:24,943
我要他们的骨头都变成冰!
Their bones will turn to ice!

1077
01:21:26,373 --> 01:21:29,658
我要亲手把他们的血冻住!
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

1078
01:21:29,876 --> 01:21:31,453
当然要杀了他们...
Kill them, of course.

1079
01:21:31,670 --> 01:21:33,164
但就仅此而已吗?
But why stop there?

1080
01:21:33,380 --> 01:21:36,416
为什么只有蝙蝠侠和罗宾死...
Why should only Batman and Robin die...

1081
01:21:36,633 --> 01:21:40,167
而创造他们的人类社会却不受惩罚?
...while the society that created them goes unpunished?

1082
01:21:40,387 --> 01:21:42,130
说的对.
Yes!

1083
01:21:42,347 --> 01:21:44,339
如果我要承受痛苦...
If I must suffer...

1084
01:21:44,558 --> 01:21:47,724
那么人类也要和我一起痛苦!
...humanity will suffer with me!

1085
01:21:47,937 --> 01:21:50,606
我会报复他们的,因为他们...
I shall repay them for sentencing me to a life without human comfort.

1086
01:21:50,814 --> 01:21:53,352
让我过着感受不到人间温暖的生活.

1087
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:56,651
我要让这个城市笼罩在无尽的冬天之下!
I will blanket the city in endless winter!

1088
01:21:56,862 --> 01:21:58,404
首先...
First...

1089
01:21:59,615 --> 01:22:01,025
是纽约...
...Gotham.

1090
01:22:02,285 --> 01:22:05,072
然后...是全世界!
And then...

1091
01:22:05,288 --> 01:22:09,120
这也正是我想的.
...the world!

1092
01:22:05,880 --> 01:22:08,674
Just what I had in mind.

1093
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:12,618
除了我们地球上的一切都要灭绝.
Everything dead on Earth except us.

1094
01:22:12,837 --> 01:22:14,746
这是一次...
A chance for...

1095
01:22:14,964 --> 01:22:18,083
让自然母亲重生的契机.
...Mother Nature to start again.

1096
01:22:18,301 --> 01:22:20,044
也是...
Behold, the dawn of a new age.

1097
01:22:20,261 --> 01:22:21,719
一个新纪元的开始.

1098
01:22:21,930 --> 01:22:25,180
Oh...

1099
01:22:25,391 --> 01:22:28,391
我的植物们拥有致命野兽的力量.
My mutant plants have the strength of the deadliest animals.

1100
01:22:28,603 --> 01:22:30,560
一旦你将人类冰冻...
Once you have frozen mankind, these babies will overrun the globe.

1101
01:22:30,772 --> 01:22:34,769
这些孩子就会遍布整个星球...

1102
01:22:34,985 --> 01:22:37,820
而我们将统治它们.
And we shall rule them.

1103
01:22:38,029 --> 01:22:39,820
因为我们是...
For we will be...

1104
01:22:40,031 --> 01:22:43,150
这世界上仅存的两个人.
...the only two people left in the world.

1105
01:22:43,368 --> 01:22:45,028
是的.
Yes.

1106
01:22:45,245 --> 01:22:49,289
亚当...和夏娃.
Adam...

1107
01:22:49,499 --> 01:22:51,041
是的.
...and Evil.

1108
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:51,217
Yes.

1109
01:22:51,251 --> 01:22:52,994
当我准备冰冻纽约时...
You distract the bat and bird...

1110
01:22:53,212 --> 01:22:57,874
你就去吸引蝙蝠们的注意!
...while I prepare...

1111
01:22:55,221 --> 01:22:56,639
...to freeze...

1112
01:22:58,092 --> 01:22:59,586
Ahh!
...Gotham!

1113
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,257
[Beeping]

1114
01:23:12,481 --> 01:23:16,063
已经到了Macgregor综合症的某个阶段了.
It's stage one of Macgregor's Syndrome.

1115
01:23:16,277 --> 01:23:18,316
我很抱歉.
I'm sorry.

1116
01:23:18,529 --> 01:23:21,648
我们所能做的就是让他舒服点.
All we can do is make him comfortable.

1117
01:23:23,493 --> 01:23:25,616
谢谢你,医生.
Thank you, doctor.

1118
01:23:42,679 --> 01:23:44,422
Macgregor综合症--Fries的妻子也是这种病.
Macgregor's Syndrome is what Fries' wife had.

1119
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,797
是的.Alfred的情况还没那么糟糕.
Alfred's condition is less severe. Fries' research said...

1120
01:23:47,017 --> 01:23:49,424
Fries的研究提过曾经治好过一个类似Alfred的病人.

1121
01:23:49,644 --> 01:23:51,186
只是没有说如何治好的.
...he cured a case like it, just didn't say how.

1122
01:23:51,396 --> 01:23:52,973
我查过数据库. 没有类似的.
No one else is even close.

1123
01:23:53,190 --> 01:23:54,684
好吧. 我得去参加捐赠仪式了...
I'm late for the dedication, then I go after Freeze and Ivy alone.

1124
01:23:54,900 --> 01:23:56,726
然后我会独自去找冰冻人和lvy.

1125
01:23:56,943 --> 01:23:58,769
-就象你平时那样. -不要马上就责怪我.
- Like hell you do. - Don't push me right now.

1126
01:23:58,987 --> 01:24:03,483
什么? 除了蝙蝠就没人能抓住lvy了吗?
Or what? No one can capture Ivy but the big, bad bat?

1127
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,657
你只是为了自己才想抓她的,不是吗?
Yeah, right. You want her for yourself, don't you?

1128
01:24:05,869 --> 01:24:07,826
我抓她是因为她很坏,我能感觉到.
I want her so badly, I can taste it. That's the whole point.

1129
01:24:08,038 --> 01:24:09,318
仅此而已.

1130
01:24:09,540 --> 01:24:11,532
瞧,你和我本都是完美的楷模.
She's done something to us. She has us fighting over her somehow.

1131
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:14,501
她肯定在我们身上做了手脚-- 不知何故会为她争斗.

1132
01:24:14,712 --> 01:24:16,040
我知道为什么.
I know she loves me and not you, and it's driving you crazy.

1133
01:24:16,255 --> 01:24:18,164
她爱我,这让你发疯.

1134
01:24:18,382 --> 01:24:20,920
所以你要阻止我们接吻.
That's why you stopped us from kissing.

1135
01:24:21,135 --> 01:24:23,804
她已经占据了你的脑海. 你无法正确思考了.
- You're not thinking straight. - But I am.

1136
01:24:24,013 --> 01:24:26,848
Oh,但我可以,从现在开始,以后也是.
For the first time in a long time.

1137
01:24:27,057 --> 01:24:30,141
我要在天空中有Robin的标志,好吗?
I want a Robin signal in the sky, all right?

1138
01:24:30,352 --> 01:24:33,555
我厌倦了活在你的阴影下.现在一切结束了.
I'm tired of living in your shadow.

1139
01:24:32,193 --> 01:24:33,486
All that ends now.

1140
01:24:38,236 --> 01:24:40,275
我很抱歉,叔叔.
I'm sorry, Uncle.

1141
01:24:41,489 --> 01:24:43,481
我太迟了.
I was too late.

1142
01:24:47,787 --> 01:24:49,744
你,你一定要...
You must....

1143
01:24:53,877 --> 01:24:56,961
你一定要为我做件事.
You must do something for me.

1144
01:24:58,798 --> 01:25:00,624
找到我的兄弟Wilfred...
Find my brother, Wilfred...

1145
01:25:00,842 --> 01:25:03,463
你的叔叔,无论他在哪...
...your uncle, wherever he is and give him this.

1146
01:25:03,678 --> 01:25:04,792
把这个给他.

1147
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:10,220
他要代替我来完成我的责任.
I have duties that he must fulfill in my stead.

1148
01:25:10,435 --> 01:25:12,511
只有亲人可以信任.
Only family can be trusted.

1149
01:25:12,729 --> 01:25:14,805
是什么?
What is it?

1150
01:25:15,023 --> 01:25:16,683
那是两个优秀男人对我的...
It is a sacred trust of two good men...

1151
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:20,351
神圣的信任,我可以荣幸地...

1152
01:25:20,570 --> 01:25:22,396
称他们为儿子.
...whom I have the honor of calling "sir."

1153
01:25:24,992 --> 01:25:28,692
把这个带给Wilfred, 我恳求你...
Take it to Wilfred, and I implore you...

1154
01:25:28,912 --> 01:25:30,703
绝对不要打开它.
...never open it.

1155
01:25:33,792 --> 01:25:37,374
你看起来真象你妈妈.
You look so like your mother.

1156
01:25:40,508 --> 01:25:43,378
Bonsoir,亲爱的纽约市民们,
Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites.

1157
01:25:43,594 --> 01:25:45,218
每一位来到...
Everyone who's anyone...

1158
01:25:45,429 --> 01:25:47,255
纽约市天文台的人...
...has flocked to the Observatory...

1159
01:25:47,473 --> 01:25:51,885
在这星光灿烂的夜晚将要举行天文望远镜的捐赠仪式.
...and tonight's star-studded dedication of the new telescope.

1160
01:25:52,103 --> 01:25:53,894
[Applause]

1161
01:25:56,607 --> 01:26:00,225
这位就是捐赠者本人--
And here's the man of the hour himself...

1162
01:26:00,445 --> 01:26:02,521
Bruce Wayne!
...Bruce Wayne.

1163
01:26:02,739 --> 01:26:04,233
Wayne先生,您有什么要说的吗?
Mr. Wayne, how about a statement?

1164
01:26:04,449 --> 01:26:06,026
Wayne先生,这边.
Excuse me.

1165
01:26:06,242 --> 01:26:07,866
这儿,Wayne先生!
- Over here, Mr. Wayne. - Bruce! Bruce!

1166
01:26:08,077 --> 01:26:09,535
局长.
Commissioner.

1167
01:26:09,746 --> 01:26:11,738
-Bruce, 你好吗? -不错.你认识的,Julie.
- How are you? - Good.

1168
01:26:11,956 --> 01:26:15,325
-Julie,你好吗? -见到你真高兴.
- How are you? - How are you? Good to see you, Bruce.

1169
01:26:15,543 --> 01:26:18,378
Gerty,你好吗?小伙子,等等.

1170
01:26:18,588 --> 01:26:20,046
Julie!
Young man.

1171
01:26:20,256 --> 01:26:22,462
Hello, Gerty. 真高兴又见到你了.
Hello, Gerty. Lovely to see you again.

1172
01:26:27,264 --> 01:26:28,544
-谢谢. -不客气.
Thank you.

1173
01:26:28,765 --> 01:26:30,140
Gordon局长.
- Commissioner Gordon. - Yes?

1174
01:26:30,350 --> 01:26:32,093
嗯?

1175
01:26:33,311 --> 01:26:35,137
我一直想知道...
I've always wondered...

1176
01:26:35,355 --> 01:26:39,222
那只大蝙蝠的灯光是从哪来的?
...where does that big old batlight come from?

1177
01:26:44,865 --> 01:26:47,190
为什么...它就在...

I'd just love to see it.

01:26:53,749 --> 01:26:56,204
但也许你没法进去.
But you probably don't have access.

为什么,亲爱的小姐...
Why, dear lady...

1182
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,293
我可是警察局的局长.

你是谁,亲爱的小姐?
Who are you, dear lady?

1188
01:27:30,203 --> 01:27:33,287
仔细想想,对我来说你实在是太老了.
On second thought, you're way too old for me.

1189
01:27:33,498 --> 01:27:36,249
不,我不老.
No, I'm not.

01:27:36,459 --> 01:27:40,124
求求你...回来.

She is Pamela Isley. She must've stolen Gordon's keys.

Sorry, my vines have a crush on you.

1327
01:39:15,966 --> 01:39:18,717
Ha ha ha! 走了.

1328
01:39:18,927 --> 01:39:22,971
这么多人要杀,没多少时间了.
Got to go.

1329
01:39:19,037 --> 01:39:22,499
So many people to kill, so little time.

1330
01:39:26,768 --> 01:39:28,677
[Crash]

1331
01:39:31,440 --> 01:39:33,728
你会变成一堆肥料.
You're about to become compost.

1332
01:39:39,323 --> 01:39:40,236
Unh!

1333
01:39:40,449 --> 01:39:43,734
用美人计来达到你的目的?
Using feminine wiles to get what you want? Trading on your looks?

1334
01:39:43,953 --> 01:39:45,910
出卖你的色相? 好好看看书吧,大姐.
Read a book. That passive-aggressive number went out long ago.

1335
01:39:46,122 --> 01:39:48,909
这一套早就过时了.

1336
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:51,248
你这样的菜鸟真是丢女人的脸.
Chicks like you give women a bad name.

1337
01:40:01,137 --> 01:40:02,216
Unh!

1338
01:40:11,314 --> 01:40:15,561
正如我拔掉Fries小姐的插头时说的...
As I told Lady Fries when I pulled her plug...

1339
01:40:15,777 --> 01:40:17,271
这是一个女人的表演.
...this is a one-woman show.

1340
01:40:17,487 --> 01:40:19,775
我可不这么认为. Hyah!
I don't think so.

1341
01:40:29,082 --> 01:40:31,240
Hmm.

1342
01:40:34,546 --> 01:40:36,871
Hyah! Hyah!

1343
01:40:41,011 --> 01:40:45,388
该死! No-o-o!
Curses!

1344
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:43,955
No!

1345
01:40:45,599 --> 01:40:47,722
[Screaming]

1346
01:40:58,195 --> 01:40:59,772
冰冻人要冻住整个城市.
Freeze is going to ice the city.

1347
01:40:59,989 --> 01:41:02,361
我知道.你是?
I know.

1348
01:41:02,575 --> 01:41:03,606
蝙蝠女孩.
- And you are? - Batgirl.

1349
01:41:03,826 --> 01:41:05,201
这个称号还不坏.
That's not P.C. What about Batperson or Batwoman?

1350
01:41:05,411 --> 01:41:07,368
"蝙蝠人"或者"蝙蝠女"怎么样?

1351
01:41:07,580 --> 01:41:11,245
是我,Barbara. 我找到了蝙蝠洞.
Bruce, it's me, Barbara. I found the batcave.

1352
01:41:11,459 --> 01:41:12,704
我们要换锁了.
We must change the locks.

1353
01:41:12,919 --> 01:41:15,326
-她知道了我们是谁. -我们得杀了她.
- She knows who we are. - We must kill her.

1354
01:41:15,546 --> 01:41:17,871
稍后再杀她. 我们还有事要做.
Yep. We'll kill her later. We have work to do.

1355
01:41:36,943 --> 01:41:39,813
我们得弄掉一些冰.
Let's kick some ice.

1356
01:41:40,030 --> 01:41:41,690
是的.
Yes.

1357
01:41:41,906 --> 01:41:44,990
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1358
01:41:49,748 --> 01:41:51,491
是的.
Yes.

1359
01:42:04,555 --> 01:42:07,805
是的.是的.是的!
Yes. Yes. Yes.

1360
01:42:08,017 --> 01:42:10,804
我们得赶快逃!

1361
01:42:22,406 --> 01:42:24,694
[Sirens]

1362
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,867
Ahh!

1363
01:42:40,258 --> 01:42:43,424
Ha ha ha!

1364
01:43:06,993 --> 01:43:10,527
我们只有不到11分钟的时间来解冻这个城市.
We have less than 11 minutes to thaw the city.

1365
01:43:37,483 --> 01:43:38,681
接住你了!
Gotcha!

1366
01:43:39,902 --> 01:43:41,147
快!
Now!

1367
01:43:50,621 --> 01:43:52,163
防护盾.
Shield.

1368
01:43:55,793 --> 01:43:57,584
不!

1369
01:43:59,130 --> 01:44:02,333
Aah! Unh!

1370
01:44:13,853 --> 01:44:15,929
我要毁掉这个城市.
I'll finish off the city.

1371
01:44:16,147 --> 01:44:19,847
你去干掉那两个小家伙,蝙蝠留给我.
You kill the kids...

1372
01:44:17,961 --> 01:44:20,505
- ...but leave me the bat. - Bat!

1373
01:44:20,068 --> 01:44:21,348
蝙蝠.

1374
01:44:39,213 --> 01:44:41,501
雪人的影子都看不到.
No sign of the snowman.

1375
01:44:41,715 --> 01:44:44,170
也许他融化了.
Maybe he melted.

1376
01:44:44,385 --> 01:44:46,673
不.他正在冬眠.
No, he's just hibernating.

1377
01:45:04,363 --> 01:45:05,987
这些加热器可以将他们解冻.
These heaters will thaw them.

1378
01:45:13,539 --> 01:45:15,531
我真希望你有一千万个那样的小玩具.
I hope you've got 10 million more of those.

1379
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:18,038
只剩八分多钟了,否则他们将永远变成冰块.
Eight minutes and they're ice cubes forever.

1380
01:45:18,253 --> 01:45:20,210
阳光可以阻止冰冻的进程.
Sunlight could reverse the freezing process.

1381
01:45:20,421 --> 01:45:22,247
还要五小时才会日出.
- Sunrise isn't for five hours. - Here.

1382
01:45:22,465 --> 01:45:24,007
但在刚果已经是早晨了.
It's morning in the Congo.

1383
01:45:24,217 --> 01:45:26,589
-如果我们传递阳光... -从赤道...
- We'll relay sunlight-- - From below the equator--

1384
01:45:26,803 --> 01:45:30,503
只要让卫星重新排列一分钟--该死.
It'll take the satellites a minute to realign, but....

1385
01:45:30,724 --> 01:45:32,348
说该死可不太好.
- Damn. - Damn? Damn's not good.

1386
01:45:32,559 --> 01:45:33,638
连那些反射镜都冻住了.
Those targeting mirrors are frozen. The beam won't work.

1387
01:45:33,852 --> 01:45:35,227
解冻器没法运转了.

1388
01:45:35,437 --> 01:45:38,852
我去设置望远镜.你们去解冻反射镜.
You thaw the mirrors.

1389
01:46:03,215 --> 01:46:06,963
今晚已经可以预见: 冰冻即将降临.
Tonight's forecast:

1390
01:46:05,109 --> 01:46:06,903
A freeze is coming.

1391
01:46:14,143 --> 01:46:16,550
-不! -Aah!

1392
01:46:21,192 --> 01:46:23,398
再见. Heh heh heh!
Bye-bye.

1393
01:46:35,665 --> 01:46:37,207
我抓住你了!
I got you!

1394
01:46:38,751 --> 01:46:40,790
-Aah! -Aah!

1395
01:46:47,344 --> 01:46:50,261
不.是我抓住你了.
No. I got you.

1396
01:46:54,810 --> 01:46:58,261
Ha ha ha! 好!

1397
01:46:57,036 --> 01:46:58,329
Yes.

1398

是上次那个人!
It's one of those days!

01:47:10,409 --> 01:47:12,734
Ah, yes! Ha!

-Ooh! -Ooh!

01:47:46,738 --> 01:47:48,398
Ha ha ha!

1405
01:47:52,076 --> 01:47:53,618
-Yeah! -Yes!
- Yeah! - Yes.

1406
01:47:53,828 --> 01:47:56,283
Arrrrggghh!

卑鄙的战士!
Dirty fighter, dirty fighter!

Whoooaaahhh!

1411
01:48:31,492 --> 01:48:32,523
Yeah,蝙蝠侠!
Yay, Batman!

1412
01:48:36,330 --> 01:48:37,705
Oh, 不!
Oh, no.

1413
01:48:46,006 --> 01:48:48,876
冰冻人,加热开始了.
Hey, Freeze. The heat is on.

1414
01:49:01,981 --> 01:49:03,605
你们在下面没事吧?
- You all right down there? - Yeah.

1415
01:49:03,816 --> 01:49:05,061
-Y eah. -Yeah.

1416
01:49:05,276 --> 01:49:06,651
就是这.
Here goes.

1417
01:49:29,259 --> 01:49:32,046
Aaaahhhh...

1418
01:49:34,181 --> 01:49:35,176
-Aah! -Ooh!

1419
01:49:35,390 --> 01:49:36,884
坚持住.
Hang on.

1420
01:49:51,865 --> 01:49:53,738
蝙蝠侠,做的好!
Batman, you're doing it!

1421
01:49:54,785 --> 01:49:56,279
你输了,冰冻人.
You've lost, Freeze.

1422
01:49:56,495 --> 01:49:58,452
我不这么认为.
I think not.

1423
01:49:58,664 --> 01:50:01,997
炸弹已经装好了,蝙蝠侠.
Bombs away, Batman.

1424
01:50:02,209 --> 01:50:03,489
Ha ha ha!

1425
01:50:18,643 --> 01:50:21,216
[Bane whimpering]

1426
01:50:25,567 --> 01:50:29,695
冰冻地狱,蝙蝠侠!
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1427
01:50:34,826 --> 01:50:36,783
-Oh! -Aah!

1428
01:50:39,372 --> 01:50:41,281
-Aah! -Aah!

1429
01:50:55,514 --> 01:50:58,349
-我们现在怎么办? -祈祷吧.
- What should we do now? - Pray.

1430
01:51:04,398 --> 01:51:06,189
坚持住!
Hang on!

1431
01:51:08,694 --> 01:51:11,398
抓住我的绳子!
Grab onto my belt!

1432
01:51:26,546 --> 01:51:29,084
Oh!

1433
01:51:29,298 --> 01:51:33,710
-谢谢,蝙蝠侠! -谢谢,蝙蝠侠!
- Thank you, Batman! - Thank you!

1434
01:51:36,222 --> 01:51:38,713
要带你们一程吗?
Need a ride?

1435
01:51:47,442 --> 01:51:49,066
纽约市大部分还冻着.
- Most of Gotham's still frozen. - It's midnight.

1436
01:51:49,277 --> 01:51:50,687
现在是午夜. 望远镜又坏了.

1437
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:53,655
没办法解冻城市了.
Telescope's gone. There's no way to thaw the city.

1438
01:51:53,865 --> 01:51:55,738
可以改变卫星的位置来解冻城市...
The satellites could do it, but it'd take a computer genius.

1439
01:51:55,951 --> 01:51:57,196
但需要一个计算机天才--
I'm on it.

1440
01:51:57,410 --> 01:52:00,446
-我来! -不.我来!

1441
01:51:59,088 --> 01:52:00,339
No, I'm on it.

1442
01:52:06,169 --> 01:52:07,367
我们得把它上下颠倒过来.
Have to do it upside down.

1443
01:52:07,587 --> 01:52:10,587
伙计-- 事情不是那么简单的.
Men! Everything the hard way.

1444
01:52:12,426 --> 01:52:14,833
你确实很擅长这个,小姑娘.
You're pretty good at this, little girl.

1445
01:52:15,053 --> 01:52:18,967
看好了,学着点,小男孩.
Well, watch and learn, little boy.

1446
01:53:25,959 --> 01:53:28,247
看起来又是美好的一天.
Looks like it's gonna be a beautiful day.

1447
01:53:36,637 --> 01:53:39,887
我要把你带回Arkham Asylum.
I'm taking you back to Arkham Asylum.

1448
01:53:40,641 --> 01:53:42,847
来啊...
Go on.

1449
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:46,014
把我也杀了,就象你杀我妻子那样.
Kill me too.

1450
01:53:44,610 --> 01:53:46,362
Just as you killed my wife.

1451
01:53:46,230 --> 01:53:48,139
我没杀你妻子.
I didn't kill your wife.

1452
01:53:53,279 --> 01:53:57,146
正如我拔掉Fries小姐的插头时说的...
As I told Lady Fries when I pulled her plug...

1453
01:53:57,366 --> 01:54:00,236
这是一个女人的表演.
...this is a one-woman show.

1454
01:54:00,453 --> 01:54:05,328
Arrrrggghhh!

1455
01:54:05,541 --> 01:54:07,664
但她还没死.
But she's not dead.

1456
01:54:07,877 --> 01:54:10,628
我们找到了她,把她又放回去了.
We found her, restored her.

1457
01:54:10,838 --> 01:54:13,245
她还被冰冻着,还活着...
She's still frozen alive...

1458
01:54:13,466 --> 01:54:14,711
等你找到治疗方法.
...waiting for you to find a cure.

1459
01:54:14,926 --> 01:54:17,630
Huh? 她还活着?
She lives?

1460
01:54:17,846 --> 01:54:19,672
-是的. -她还活着!
- Yes. - She lives.

1461
01:54:19,889 --> 01:54:23,756
复仇不代表力量. 每个人都能夺取生命.
But vengeance isn't power. Anyone can take a life.

1462
01:54:23,977 --> 01:54:25,850
但赐予生命...
But to give life...

1463
01:54:26,062 --> 01:54:28,766
才是真正的力量, 你曾经拥有的力量.
...that's true power. A power you once had.

1464
01:54:30,150 --> 01:54:32,059
她还活着?
She's alive.

1465
01:54:37,574 --> 01:54:40,409
因此我求你...
So I'm asking you.

1466
01:54:40,619 --> 01:54:42,777
Victor Fries...
Victor Fries...

1467
01:54:42,996 --> 01:54:44,988
帮我拯救另一条生命.
...help me save another life.

1468
01:54:45,207 --> 01:54:47,958
告诉我如何治疗Macgregor综合症的第一阶段...
Show me how to cure Macgregor's Syndrome, stage one.

1469
01:54:48,168 --> 01:54:50,456
也许你就能拯救一个...
And maybe you can also save the life of the man your wife once loved.

1470
01:54:50,671 --> 01:54:53,209
你妻子曾经爱过的男人的生命.

1471
01:54:53,424 --> 01:54:55,297
他还在你体内, Victor.
He's still inside you, Victor.

1472
01:54:55,509 --> 01:55:00,135
深深地...埋在... 雪下面.
Buried...

1473
01:54:57,975 --> 01:55:00,185
...deep beneath the snow.

1474
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:04,676
你会帮我吗...
Will you help me...

1475
01:55:04,894 --> 01:55:06,637
博士?
...doctor?

1476
01:55:30,795 --> 01:55:33,333
把这两个拿去...
Take two of these...

1477
01:55:34,799 --> 01:55:37,337
明天早上找我.
...and call me in the morning.

1478
01:55:46,561 --> 01:55:50,179
我会把你妻子送到Arkham的实验室.
I'll have your wife moved to the lab at Arkham.

1479
01:55:50,398 --> 01:55:53,564
你可以在那里继续你的研究.
You'll be able to continue your research there.

1480
01:56:15,507 --> 01:56:19,125
我们现在能做的就是等...
All we can do now is wait...

1481
01:56:19,345 --> 01:56:21,218
还有祈祷.
...and hope.

1482
01:56:33,234 --> 01:56:36,768
他爱我...

1483
01:56:34,738 --> 01:56:36,115
He loves me.

1484
01:56:36,988 --> 01:56:38,980
他不爱我.
He loves me not.

1485
01:56:40,033 --> 01:56:42,440
他爱我...
He loves me.

1486
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:44,783
他不爱我.
He loves me not.

1487
01:56:47,415 --> 01:56:50,581
他爱我...
He loves me.

1488
01:56:50,794 --> 01:56:53,166
他不爱我.
He loves me not.

1489
01:56:55,048 --> 01:56:57,799
他爱我...
He loves me.

1490
01:56:58,009 --> 01:56:59,752
不爱!
Not!

1491
01:57:01,388 --> 01:57:04,970
真惊讶. 我是你的新室友.
Surprise.

1492
01:57:03,267 --> 01:57:05,269
I'm your new cellmate.

1493
01:57:07,185 --> 01:57:11,514
我是来把你送进地狱的.
And I've come to make your life a living hell.

1494
01:57:11,732 --> 01:57:14,851
准备吞下你自己种下的恶果吧.
Prepare for a bitter harvest.

1495
01:57:18,197 --> 01:57:22,064
冬天...最终来了.
Winter has come at last.

1496
01:57:56,569 --> 01:57:58,442
Ahem.

1497
01:58:02,283 --> 01:58:04,026
Alfred.
Alfred.

1498
01:58:07,080 --> 01:58:08,111
你...
Are you...?

1499
01:58:08,331 --> 01:58:10,074
很失望...
Rather disappointed at how poorly I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1500
01:58:10,291 --> 01:58:13,541
我没好好教你怎么把持家务.

1501
01:58:13,753 --> 01:58:15,959
看起来很不错!
And quite well, it seems!

1502
01:58:16,172 --> 01:58:19,837
谢谢你,孩子. 谢谢你们大家.
Thanks to you, son.

1503
01:58:17,674 --> 01:58:19,843
Thanks to you all.

1504
01:58:20,051 --> 01:58:21,877
干的不错, Bruce.
Well done, Bruce.

1505
01:58:22,095 --> 01:58:24,218
你也干的不错.
You too. Well done.

1506
01:58:25,390 --> 01:58:26,635
我有个问题.
I got one question.

1507
01:58:26,850 --> 01:58:28,510
当蝙蝠女孩和我掉下望远镜时...
When we fell off the telescope, why didn't you try and save us?

1508
01:58:28,727 --> 01:58:30,719
为什么你不救我们?

1509
01:58:30,937 --> 01:58:31,885
第一次我掉下去时...
It's the first time I fell and you weren't there.

1510
01:58:32,105 --> 01:58:33,184
你也没去抓住我.

1511
01:58:33,398 --> 01:58:34,808
我想你能自己解决.
I figured you could handle it.

1512
01:58:35,025 --> 01:58:37,942
你知道, Dick, 有时互相帮助...
You know, sometimes counting on somebody else is the only way to win.

1513
01:58:38,153 --> 01:58:40,525
才是唯一的取胜之道.

1514
01:58:42,157 --> 01:58:43,781
Ahem! 打扰一下.
Excuse me. I'm the one who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

1515
01:58:43,992 --> 01:58:46,233
我认为是我解决了lvy的那些植物.

1516
01:58:46,453 --> 01:58:49,122
是的,就是我.我一个就搞定了.
Yeah, that was me.

1517
01:58:49,331 --> 01:58:50,659
就是我.
I did it all by myself. That was me.

1518
01:58:50,875 --> 01:58:52,914
你要回学校去.
You are going back to school.

1519
01:58:53,127 --> 01:58:55,166
Bruce, 你永远不会赢得这场争论的.
You'll never win this argument.

1520
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,460
拍档?
Partners?

1521
01:59:04,639 --> 01:59:07,308
拍档

1522
01:59:06,348 --> 01:59:07,933
Partners.

1523
01:59:16,359 --> 01:59:18,019
拍档
Partners.

1524
01:59:21,322 --> 01:59:24,157
我们需要一个更大的蝙蝠洞.
We're going to need a bigger cave.
