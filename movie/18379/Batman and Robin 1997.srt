1
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,471
I want a car.

2
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:23,475
Chicks dig the car.

3
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:26,395
This is why Superman works alone.

4
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:38,407
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

5
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,605
Don't wait up, Al.

6
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,857
I'll cancel the pizzas.

7
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:31,627
<i>Batman, a new viIlain has</i>
<i>commandeered the Gotham Museum.</i>

8
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,712
<i>He's frozen the antiquities wing.</i>

9
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,340
<i>He's turned</i>
<i>the security guards into ice.</i>

10
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,842
<i>He's calling himself, "Mr. Freeze."</i>

11
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,886
Mr. Freeze.

12
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:06,745
Stop! Drop your weapon...

13
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,205
...or we'll shoot!

14
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,679
The Iceman Cometh.

15
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,432
Please, show some mercy.

16
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,017
Mercy?!

17
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:36,024
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy.

18
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,877
In this universe...

19
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:58,547
...there's only one absolute.

20
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,591
Everything...

21
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,593
...freezes.

22
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,309
Hi, Freeze.

23
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,727
I'm Batman.

24
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,998
You're not sending me to the cooler.

25
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,560
-Nice catch.
-You break it, you buy it.

26
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,146
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!

27
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,371
Yes, kill them! Kill them!

28
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,415
Destroy everything!

29
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,011
It's the hockey team from hell.

30
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:03,797
Get the ice...

31
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,507
...I'll get the Iceman.

32
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:32,742
Thanks.

33
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,218
Sweet.

34
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,601
I got mine. Where's yours?

35
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,937
What killed the dinosaurs?

36
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,440
The Ice Age!

37
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:56,868
Hit me, boys.

38
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,623
Thanks for playing.

39
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,360
I was hoping you'd drop in.

40
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,544
Watch the numbers...

41
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:32,213
...for they are
the harbingers of your doom.

42
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,548
Can you feel it coming?

43
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,593
The icy cold of space.

44
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:42,015
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze...

45
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,434
...and beat no more.

46
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:57,739
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham.

47
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,407
Freeze, you're mad.

48
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,410
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands.

49
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,620
Freeze well.

50
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,729
-Who invited you?
-I was hanging around.

51
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,732
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs.

52
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,568
How about, "Nice to see you.
Thanks for saving my life."

53
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,959
-A batbomb?
-We must blow this up...

54
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:53,420
...before it turns Gotham into a crater.

55
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,964
Now what, call a taxi?!

56
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,133
Watch the first step!

57
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:00,468
Surf's up!

58
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,713
Gotcha!

59
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,220
Cowabunga!

60
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,200
He's freezing the furnace!

61
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:46,908
I got him.

62
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,041
Stay cool...

63
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,751
...Birdboy.

64
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,139
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird.

65
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,559
Will you chase the villain...

66
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:13,768
...or save him?

67
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,271
Emotion makes you weak.

68
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,857
That's why this day is mine.

69
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,360
I'll kill you next time!

70
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,489
Did we get him?

71
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,338
Drats!

72
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:28,509
My experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again...

73
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:33,723
...but I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings.

74
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,810
If I can only find
the right dose of venom...

75
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:41,397
...these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals.

76
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,983
I will have given flora...

77
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:48,738
...a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man.

78
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,368
Personal note:

79
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,870
My work would proceed faster...

80
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,666
...if Dr. Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples...

81
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,710
...back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing.

82
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,546
Why won't he let me in the lab?

83
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:09,842
What is he doing in there?

84
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:31,406
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations...

85
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,116
...and...

86
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,327
...our mystery bidder...

87
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,538
...may I present...

88
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,790
...Antonio Diego...

89
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,586
...serial murderer, serving life in prison...

90
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,755
...and sole surviving...

91
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,590
...volunteer.

92
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,177
And what a charmer he is.

93
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:58,933
By merely drilling...three
concentric holes...

94
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:02,937
...directly into Antonio's
cranial cavity...l have...

95
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:07,150
...created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain...

96
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:09,986
...the limbic system.

97
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,407
And now I add...

98
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,617
...my Super-Soldier Serum...

99
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,286
...code-named...

100
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:19,954
..."Venom"...

101
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:23,291
...to which l add
my very own recipe of steroids...

102
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,168
...and toxins.

103
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:28,588
Plug it in.

104
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,131
Time to scream.

105
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,333
Genius!

106
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:06,793
Behold...

107
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:09,670
...the ideal killing machine!

108
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,006
I call this little number...

109
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,674
..."Bane."

110
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,177
Bane of Humanity!

111
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,221
Imagine it.

112
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:22,683
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers.

113
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,311
Bidding begins at a mere...

114
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:26,979
...10 million!

115
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,606
Turbo!

116
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,358
Show off for Daddy.

117
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,526
Dr. Isley.

118
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,156
Welcome to my parlor.

119
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,491
What?

120
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,160
You monster!

121
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:23,870
How could you?!

122
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:27,331
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications.

123
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,042
-He cut the funding for our work.
-Our work?

124
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,752
Without your research...

125
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:34,589
...I couldn't have come this far.
Join me.

126
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:39,051
-The two of us, entwined, side by side.
-Join you?

127
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:44,265
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction...

128
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,850
...and now you...

129
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,394
...corrupt my research...

130
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:52,231
...into some maniacal scheme
for world domination?

131
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,943
When I get through...

132
00:19:56,153 --> 00:20:00,865
...you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry.

133
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,450
Do you hear me?!

134
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:04,911
You psycho!

135
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,331
Well...

136
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,541
...I can respect your opinion.

137
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:13,377
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection.

138
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:15,755
I'm afraid you'll have to die.

139
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,243
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you...

140
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:48,079
...deep into the earth
you love so much!

141
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,956
Bye-bye, dear!

142
00:20:50,457 --> 00:20:51,832
Fellow maniacs...

143
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,668
...bidding...

144
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,544
...begins!

145
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:06,055
Gotham University Labs
security video, 2 years ago.

146
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,183
Dr. Victor Fries...

147
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,729
...2-time Olympic decathlete and Nobel
Prize winner for molecular biology.

148
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:16,399
After his wife
contracted a rare disease...

149
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,775
...Macgregor's Syndrome...

150
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:21,362
...he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure.

151
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,156
Now, here's where
everything goes north.

152
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,331
That's got to hurt.

153
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,917
That liquid is 50 below.

154
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,169
But, he survived somehow.

155
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,423
The cryo-solution mutated his body.

156
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,805
-What happened to his wife?
-No one knows.

157
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:49,432
She's presumed dead.

158
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,642
Fries needs
extreme cold to survive.

159
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:56,772
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees.

160
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,110
If it's ice the Iceman wants....

161
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:07,867
Alfred.

162
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,913
Coming, sir.

163
00:22:14,541 --> 00:22:15,791
Yes, sir?

164
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,752
We need the Wayne diamonds.

165
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:19,712
We going to trap a snowman?

166
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,508
Yes, right after you spend
10 hours in the simulator, training.

167
00:22:24,718 --> 00:22:28,095
I made a mistake. I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

168
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,348
You were reckless
and almost got killed.

169
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:32,892
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

170
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,145
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

171
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,150
How indeed?

172
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,861
He's overeager, he's impulsive.

173
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:46,322
I can't trust him not to get hurt.

174
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:50,493
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone.

175
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,996
Don't tell me
you're on his side again.

176
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,041
Despite all your talents...

177
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,378
...you're still just
a novice in the ways of family.

178
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:04,090
Master Dick follows
the same star as you...

179
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,259
...but gets there by his own course.

180
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:11,597
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family.

181
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,433
I trust you, Alfred.

182
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,937
But I shan't be here forever.

183
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,192
Good night, Master Bruce.

184
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:26,862
Good night, Alfred.

185
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,427
Oh, dear, Master Bruce.

186
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,054
Good gracious, what a tumble.

187
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,390
There's a brave boy.

188
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:08,487
Yes, sir. I am so pleased you won
the bidding, Your Supreme Ruthlessness.

189
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:11,866
We're making the final modifications
on Bane right now.

190
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:16,912
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail.

191
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:39,852
Dr. Isley?

192
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,438
Pamela?

193
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,191
You look great.

194
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,902
Especially for a dead woman.

195
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,863
Hello, Jason.

196
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:54,867
I think I've had a change of heart.

197
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,327
Or quite...

198
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,828
...literally...

199
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:03,000
...the animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me.

200
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:05,836
They replaced my blood with aloe...

201
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:09,089
...my skin with chlorophyll...

202
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:10,883
...and filled...

203
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,885
...my lips...

204
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,439
...with venom.

205
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,986
And, Jason, one other thing.

206
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:35,491
I probably
should have mentioned this earlier...

207
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,576
...I'm...

208
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,787
...poison.

209
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:48,295
It's a jungle in here.

210
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,465
I am Nature's arm...

211
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,051
...her spirit...

212
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,554
...her will!

213
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,473
Hell, I am Mother Nature.

214
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,642
And the time has come...

215
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,686
...for plants to take back...

216
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:06,689
...the world so rightfully ours...

217
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:08,399
...because it's not nice...

218
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:12,319
...to fool with Mother Nature.

219
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,578
"Wayne Enterprises."

220
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,001
Coming, Bane, darling.

221
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:29,253
We've got a plane to catch.

222
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,683
<i>I'm Mr. White Christmas</i>

223
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,768
<i>I'm Mr. Snow</i>

224
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:47,688
<i>I'm Mr. Icicle</i>

225
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,857
<i>I'm Mr. Ten Below</i>

226
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,442
Sing! Sing!

227
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,033
Come on, sing!

228
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:01,577
Louder! Come on!

229
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,704
Sing! Sing! Sing!

230
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,623
<i>He's Mr. White Christmas</i>

231
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:07,374
Louder!

232
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,711
<i>He's Mr. Icicle</i>

233
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,213
Freezy...

234
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,424
...I'm feeling hot.

235
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,551
I find that unlikely.

236
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:21,764
So my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry...

237
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,224
...I'd weather blizzards to have you.

238
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:26,935
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known.

239
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,355
Let's heat things up.

240
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:32,066
My passion thaws
for my bride alone.

241
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,236
Talk about your cold shoulder.

242
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,701
Frosty!

243
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,161
Yeah, boss?

244
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,497
Energy.

245
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,292
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power.

246
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,173
But...

247
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:59,677
...I was successful nevertheless.

248
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,221
Absolutely, boss.

249
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,973
One more giant diamond of this size...

250
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:08,185
...and my freezing engine
will be complete.

251
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,773
I will freeze the city.

252
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:16,068
Then I will hold Gotham ransom.

253
00:28:16,277 --> 00:28:18,654
Unless the city bows
to my demands...

254
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,614
...it's winter forever
in Gotham.

255
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,659
The city fathers
will have no choice...

256
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,788
...but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research...

257
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,126
...so l can find a cure.

258
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,837
Leave us.

259
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,213
Sure, boss.

260
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,467
We need quality time.

261
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,903
Soon we will be together
once more.

262
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,489
Soon.

263
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,885
Alfred.

264
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:26,597
I'll get it.

265
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:39,693
I must've dozed off.
My sincerest apologies.

266
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,528
No apology necessary.

267
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,531
It's the first time it's happened
in thirty years.

268
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,213
Please be looking for me.

269
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,424
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth.

270
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,843
Uncle Alfred.

271
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,514
Uncle Alfred!

272
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,057
My dear.

273
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,017
Oh, my dear...

274
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:14,686
...what a most wonderful surprise.

275
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,856
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

276
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:20,859
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle.

277
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,486
Uncle?

278
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:29,243
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret.

279
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:33,205
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago.

280
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,749
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since.

281
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,709
-You have?
-Secrets, Al?

282
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:42,047
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house.

283
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,924
Don't you think, sir?

284
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,384
I'm on break from--

285
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:48,637
Oxbridge Academy, Alfred's alma mater.

286
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,765
The new computer sciences division.

287
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:54,935
-How'd you know?
-Says so on the patch on your sweater.

288
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:03,610
-What is it? It's beautiful.
-You can say that again.

289
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:06,905
It's a competition racer.
I've been fixing it up.

290
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:08,448
I'll show you how to ride it.

291
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,450
You certainly will not!

292
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,246
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred.
I'm terrified of these things.

293
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,665
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us.

294
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,792
Oh, l don't know.

295
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,170
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but...

296
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,172
...yeah, I'd love to.

297
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,133
Then it's settled.

298
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:28,802
But, sir, we....

299
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:31,305
We do get so busy here.

300
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,639
Don't be silly.

301
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,474
After all, she's family.

302
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:52,868
Uncle Alfred?

303
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,830
I came to tuck you in.

304
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,333
You came to tuck me in?

305
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,335
That's quite a switch.

306
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:04,129
What're you working on?

307
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,841
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred.

308
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,970
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore.

309
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,140
But Miranjapore is a floating court.

310
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,142
It travels through India.

311
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,186
I remember Mom getting postcards.

312
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:22,564
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find.

313
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,069
I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants.

314
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,406
I've been trying to reach him
with no success.

315
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:35,202
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family.

316
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:40,415
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed.

317
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,708
Peg?

318
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,544
My nickname for sweet Margaret.

319
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,383
It's good to see you again.

320
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,385
I've missed you.

321
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,388
As l have you.

322
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,224
Sleep well, child.

323
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,060
You sleep.

324
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,897
Go to bed.

325
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,297
<i>Good morning, Gotham.</i>

326
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:15,260
<i>It's Gossip Gerty reporting to you</i>

327
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:19,973

328
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:25,145

<i>legendary contribution to the city.</i>

329
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,857
Gotham Observatory, Bane.

330
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,026
And step on it.

331
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,361
Step.

332
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:46,875
<i>My father told me, "To succeed,</i>

333
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:51,838
So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope...

334
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:55,175
...to Gotham's
Observatory Restoration Project.

335
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,676
With any luck...

336
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,805
...this telescope will give
future generations...

337
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:02,015
...a chance to follow their own stars.

338
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,393
Brucy...

339
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:09,648
...is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

340
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:12,567
Yes. If you'll watch
these monitors right here.

341
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:18,240
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet.

342
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,035
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on Earth...

343
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,996
...and through this
intricate network of satellites...

344
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:29,584
...reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation.

345
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:32,087
Just don't point it at my bedroom.

346
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,053
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison...

347
00:35:40,263 --> 00:35:41,847
...have been going out forever.

348
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,224
Are you going to tie the knot?

349
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,394
Marriage?

350
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,896
You want to give me a hand here?

351
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,566
Bruce and l are recklessly in love.

352
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:56,444
And that's most certainly
enough for us...for now.

353
00:35:57,822 --> 00:36:00,907
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid.

354
00:36:01,284 --> 00:36:02,951
You're a lot of help.

355
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,079
Miss, you need to stop.

356
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:07,539
Move, fascist bulldog!

357
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,958
-You need an appointment--
-No, I don't!

358
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:13,044
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here.

359
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,421
She has no pass, sir.

360
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,382
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss--?

361
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:19,217
Dr. Pamela Isley.

362
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:20,594
Doctor...

363
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,304
...what can I do for you?

364
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,931
Actually, I already
work for you, or did.

365
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,809
Your arboreal preservation project
in South America.

366
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:31,605
We cut our funding.
There was a conflict of ideologies.

367
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,398
Dr. Woodrue was a lunatic.

368
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,774
I see you knew him.

369
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:39,112
Yes. That lab burnt down last week.
I'm glad you escaped.

370
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,450
I have here a proposal showing
how Wayne Enterprises can immediately...

371
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,620
...cease all actions
that toxify our environment.

372
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:49,122
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth...

373
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,916
...our mother, our womb.

374
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,169
She deserves your loyalty
and protection.

375
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:57,005
And yet, you spoil her lands...

376
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,798
...poison her oceans...

377
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,175
...blacken her skies!

378
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,635
You're killing her!

379
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:06,264
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat...

380
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:11,311
...no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die.

381
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,231
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet.

382
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,400
People come first, Dr. Isley.

383
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,654
Mammals!

384
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,490
A day of reckoning is coming.

385
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,824
That's right.

386
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:28,620
The same plants and flowers
that saw you...

387
00:37:28,788 --> 00:37:30,789
...crawl from the primordial soup...

388
00:37:30,998 --> 00:37:35,252
...will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

389
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,466
You must be new in town.

390
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:45,136
In Gotham City,
Batman and Robin protect us...

391
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,014
...even from plants and flowers.

392
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,186
Maybe you'd like to meet them.

393
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,231
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction...

394
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:59,025
...a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens.

395
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,863
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants.

396
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,657
Thank you all for coming.

397
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,117
Good day, doctor.

398
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:18,712
Batman and Robin...

399
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:22,674
...militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors...

400
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:27,137
...animal protectors of the status quo.

401
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,681
First...

402
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,560
...I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests.

403
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:36,855
And then Gotham...

404
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:38,523
...will be mine...

405
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,483
...for the greening.

406
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,048
Excuse me, chief.

407
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,925
I got something here
you might want to see.

408
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,518
I hate when people talk
during the movie.

409
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:37,123
One more diamond, my love.

410
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,793
One more.

411
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,386
"Bruce Wayne. Diamonds."

412
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:53,139
Very nice.

413
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:40,520
Ladies and gentlemen...

414
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:44,691
...Gossip Gerty
of "Good Morning Gotham" and I...

415
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:49,112
...welcome you the gem of the evening.

416
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:52,532
Our own Commissioner Gordon...

417
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,284
...displaying...

418
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:57,912
...the famed Heart of Isis,
on loan...

419
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:02,625
...from the collection of my
close personal friend, Bruce Wayne.

420
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,756
-Think Freeze will take the bait?
-He'll be here.

421
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:12,760
--to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers...

422
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,556
...the famed diamond
draped around her neck.

423
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:21,895
Let's start the bidding!

424
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,981
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

425
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,319
20,000 for the tiger lily!

426
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,530
And l bid...

427
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,493
...30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

428
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,583
Boys, please...

429
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,668
...let's show some gusto!

430
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,130
Hi, there.

431
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,050
And you are?

432
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,177
Poison...

433
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,887
...Poison lvy.

434
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,233
Why not send junior home early?

435
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,904
I've got some wild oats to sow.

436
00:44:19,573 --> 00:44:21,407
On the other hand...

437
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:25,495
...youth does have its advantages.

438
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,790
Endurance, stamina.

439
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,793
Forget the geriatric bat.

440
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:33,628
Come, join me.

441
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,089
My garden needs tending.

442
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:38,091
I'll take it from here, pal.

443
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:40,426
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

444
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:45,556
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot.

445
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,852
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner.

446
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,980
I'll bring everything you see here...

447
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,526
...plus everything you don't.

448
00:44:58,362 --> 00:45:01,280
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!

449
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:06,285
100,000!

450
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,830
And l'll bid...

451
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:12,291
...500,000 dollars!

452
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,294
One million dollars.

453
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,173
-2 million.
-You don't have it. 3 million.

454
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,800
I'll borrow it from you. Four.

455
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:24,762
-5 million.
-That's a utility belt, not a money belt.

456
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,056
-6 million.
-7 million.

457
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,019
Never leave the cave without it.

458
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:35,815
You boys aren't going to start
fighting over little me, now are you?

459
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,831
All right, everyone!
Chill.

460
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:56,419
Chill.

461
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,011
Get the gun!

462
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,931
Look at you!

463
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:52,016
Let me guess.

464
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:53,893
Plant Girl?

465
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,062
Vine Lady?

466
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:59,065
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal...

467
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:01,067
...or l'll turn you into mulch.

468
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,573
Pheromone dust...

469
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:11,410
...designed to heat a man's blood.

470
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:14,247
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted.
If you please!

471
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,333
If you insist.

472
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,339
Clever little clover.

473
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:29,595
That's my exit cue.

474
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,264
Thanks.

475
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,776
Good night.

476
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,613
Cool party!

477
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:18,269
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people.

478
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,738
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham.

479
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,157
That's not a man...

480
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,367
...that is a god.

481
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:41,417
Enough monkey business.

482
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:44,503
We've got work to do.

483
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:46,923
Monkey work.

484
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,058
You can't make the jump.

485
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:40,393
I can!

486
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,439
-Pull back!
-I can make it!

487
00:49:45,649 --> 00:49:47,191
Redbird control codes.

488
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:51,529
Disable engine.

489
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,657
Don't do it to me!!

490
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,166
We won't make it!

491
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:29,358
It's a cold town.

492
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,266
I could've made that jump.

493
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,352
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side.

494
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,229
The Flying Graysons were a team.

495
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,398
We had to trust each to do his job.

496
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,650
That's what being partners is about.

497
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,236
Counting on someone is the way to win.

498
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:16,781
Your head wasn't on the job.
It was on Poison Ivy.

499
00:51:17,324 --> 00:51:19,533
Maybe she wanted me instead of you.

500
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:21,452
That's your idea of friendship?

501
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:24,288
It's your rules.
It's your way, or the highway.

502
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,124
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman.

503
00:51:27,334 --> 00:51:30,503
-I'm sick of it!
-Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive.

504
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:34,048
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them.

505
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,801
This is no partnership.

506
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,552
You're never going to trust me!

507
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,061
Dear brother Wilfred...

508
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:51,524
...I have tried
every address I know for you.

509
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:54,193
I'm just praying this reaches you.

510
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,529
We have very little time.

511
00:52:13,088 --> 00:52:15,631
Batman monopolized the evening news.

512
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,469
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr. Freeze.

513
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,221
Thanks. Thank you.

514
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:27,393
Is there something wrong, sir?

515
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,854
Alfred...

516
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,189
...am l pig-headed?

517
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,402
Is it always...

518
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,571
...my way or the highway?

519
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:40,739
Why, yes. Actually.

520
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:45,661
Death and chance stole your parents...

521
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,955
...but rather than become a victim...

522
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:52,084
...you have done everything
in your power to control the fates.

523
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,753
For what is Batman...

524
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:59,675
...if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

525
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:02,469
An attempt to control...

526
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,346
...death itself?

527
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:25,784
But I can't, can I?

528
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,205
None of us can.

529
00:53:55,232 --> 00:53:57,524
Sorry. So sorry!

530
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,193
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

531
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:03,781
Just a few judo lessons.
You know, London's kind of rough.

532
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,492
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

533
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,537
Couldn't resist.

534
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,081
It's just so beautiful.

535
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:15,918
I just took it out for a spin.
I'll clean it tomorrow.

536
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,587
All right? Sorry.

537
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,131
Sorry. Good night.

538
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:08,721
Drag him into the cold beam.

539
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,516
Welcome home, Frost Face.

540
00:55:12,726 --> 00:55:15,728
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure.

541
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,607
Allow me to break the ice.

542
00:55:20,900 --> 00:55:23,068
My name is Freeze.

543
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:25,112
Learn it well...

544
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,157
...for it's the chilling sound
of your doom.

545
00:55:40,086 --> 00:55:44,506
All right, Freezy, you can't live
outside the cold zone.

546
00:55:55,852 --> 00:55:57,853
Look at him stew.

547
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,315
Get used to it.

548
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:04,401
You're going to be here a very long...

549
00:56:04,611 --> 00:56:06,362
...long time.

550
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:09,323
Sadly...

551
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,950
...you will not live to see it.

552
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,085
Oh, yes.

553
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:27,383
Batface and Birdbrain turned out
to be much more...

554
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,968
...resistant to my love dust
than expected.

555
00:56:30,178 --> 00:56:34,181
No matter. Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose.

556
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,434
They'll literally be dying for me.

557
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:40,604
"Turkish baths."

558
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,731
This looks promising.

559
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,927
A fixer-upper.

560
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,638
But with a certain homey charm.

561
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:17,599
A minus!

562
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,685
Current tenants.

563
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,813
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty.

564
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:24,773
Hello, yourself.

565
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,025
You look good enough to eat.

566
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,486
That I am.

567
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,865
Come and get me, if you can.

568
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,327
With pleasure.

569
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,308
Let's redecorate.

570
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,737
I've always hankered
for something on the water.

571
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:22,247
What is this floor?

572
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,590
It took God seven days...

573
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,926
...to create Paradise.

574
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,179
Let's see if I can do better.

575
00:58:43,603 --> 00:58:45,604
Good babies.

576
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,189
Grow for mommy.

577
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,655
Bane, darling...

578
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,283
...I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy.

579
00:58:58,451 --> 00:59:00,619
A cool customer, yes.

580
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,622
Icy demeanor...

581
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:05,707
...no question.

582
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:10,295
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use...

583
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,381
...to my advantage.

584
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:15,842
Honey, clean up this mess.

585
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,053
We've got company coming.

586
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,805
Honey.

587
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,640
Company.

588
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:32,651
Bruce....

589
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,490
We've been going out
for over a year now, and....

590
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:41,159
Okay, here it goes.

591
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,662
I want to spend my life with you.

592
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:48,667
I'm not the marrying kind.

593
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,753
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand.

594
00:59:52,338 --> 00:59:55,090
I know you're a dedicated bachelor.

595
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,758
You've had your wild nights.

596
00:59:57,427 --> 00:59:58,927
"Wild" doesn't...

597
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,263
...quite cover it.

598
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,350
You'll make someone
a good husband one day...

599
01:00:05,685 --> 01:00:08,186
...but I can't wait forever.

600
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:15,027
Look, I don't want to pressure you.
Because if I do...

601
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:17,279
...you'll just shut down.

602
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,281
I know the way you are.

603
01:00:20,867 --> 01:00:22,618
Think about it.

604
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,037
Just promise me you'll think about it.

605
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,372
Okay?

606
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,125
You don't have to answer now.

607
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:33,086
Just think it over.

608
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,130
Here's food for thought.

609
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,233
Who's Ivy?

610
01:00:56,944 --> 01:00:59,363
-What?
-You just called me "Ivy."

611
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:00,906
Who's Ivy?

612
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:03,492
I wish I knew.

613
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:08,080
Enhance detail, 14 to 19.

614
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:15,003
Who are you?

615
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:30,185
Gotcha!

616
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,818
Banker, how much coin to play?

617
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,111
Two and a half.

618
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,239
You're the chick who won
the tunnel run 2 nights ago!

619
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:25,490
That'd be me.

620
01:02:25,658 --> 01:02:27,993
That was kid stuff, sweetheart.

621
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,121
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

622
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,790
-Want a side bet?
-How much?

623
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,834
-How much you got?
-How much you got?

624
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:39,296
All right, let's race! Come on!

625
01:02:47,221 --> 01:02:50,557
Just make sure the guys are ready
at the end of the bridge.

626
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:53,018
You got it, Spike!

627
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,297
Out of my way, losers!

628
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,800
Nice try, girlie!

629
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,260
You're next!

630
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:11,763
Excuse me!

631
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:16,852
Look out, baby!

632
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,039
Not bad, for a chick!

633
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,116
Now!

634
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,423
End of the line, sweetheart!

635
01:05:54,867 --> 01:05:56,493
So this is where you hang out.

636
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,290
How long you been racing?

637
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,542
Since my parents died.

638
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:08,713
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself.

639
01:06:08,881 --> 01:06:10,674
Made the pain go away.

640
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:12,842
You wouldn't understand.

641
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:14,552
You'd be surprised.

642
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:19,557
Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at Oxbridge so...

643
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:21,184
...they kicked me out.

644
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:25,105
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed.

645
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:27,399
Don't say you want to join the circus.

646
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,529
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back.

647
01:06:33,364 --> 01:06:36,074
I'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude.

648
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:38,410
What are you talking about?

649
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:41,329
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing...

650
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,914
...it's really ridiculous.

651
01:06:43,082 --> 01:06:45,417
Alfred is a sweet, noble man...

652
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:49,087
...and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else.

653
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:51,256
Alfred and Bruce are like family.

654
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:54,592
Paying someone to prepare your meals...

655
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,679
...do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

656
01:06:57,888 --> 01:06:59,264
Alfred's happy.

657
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,932
Happy?

658
01:07:01,642 --> 01:07:03,977
You honestly don't know, do you?

659
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:06,730
How he's hiding the pain all the time.

660
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:08,815
Alfred's sick.

661
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:14,279
Alfred's not sick.

662
01:07:14,613 --> 01:07:15,947
He's dying.

663
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:19,868
Dying?

664
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,789
Why didn't he tell us?

665
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:28,001
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything.

666
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,633
But I can tell.

667
01:07:40,598 --> 01:07:42,390
I can't believe it.

668
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:44,809
I know.

669
01:08:30,856 --> 01:08:32,482
Cellblock.

670
01:08:33,484 --> 01:08:35,235
Icehead, you got a visitor.

671
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:38,196
Your sister is here to see you.

672
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:39,656
Sister?

673
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,703
Brother, dear...

674
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,540
...I heard you were blue.

675
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:53,211
Don't mind us, ma'am.

676
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:55,380
You can speak freely.

677
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:00,552
I don't mind you at all.

678
01:09:04,515 --> 01:09:05,807
Men...

679
01:09:06,016 --> 01:09:08,893
...the most absurd of God's creatures.

680
01:09:09,061 --> 01:09:10,395
We give you life...

681
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,482
...and we can take it away
just as easily.

682
01:09:14,692 --> 01:09:16,943
-Right!
-Whatever.

683
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:20,864
I really am to die for.

684
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,268
Impressive!

685
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:54,731
Well, I, my most
unabominable snowman...

686
01:09:55,274 --> 01:09:57,692
...have been impressed by you.

687
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,277
In fact...

688
01:09:59,445 --> 01:10:01,946
...I propose a pairing.

689
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,125
I've come to set you free.

690
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:16,961
An enticing offer...

691
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:18,630
...but...

692
01:10:18,797 --> 01:10:20,965
...what does the lady want in return?

693
01:10:23,636 --> 01:10:27,138
Let's cool it for now.
I've got someone I want you to meet.

694
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,940
His name is Bane.

695
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:40,610
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

696
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:48,493
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

697
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:52,830
No, I always go a size smaller.
Makes me look slimmer.

698
01:10:58,379 --> 01:10:59,921
I'm running on empty.

699
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,673
I need the diamonds.

700
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:04,008
I'll help you grab your rocks.

701
01:11:07,346 --> 01:11:08,429
Bane...

702
01:11:08,639 --> 01:11:09,931
...dear...

703
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,683
...an exit, please.

704
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:19,274
Reinforced steel.

705
01:11:19,483 --> 01:11:20,608
Not good.

706
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,871
Always winterize your pipes.

707
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:53,975
While I get my diamonds,
you and meatloaf retrieve my wife.

708
01:11:54,184 --> 01:11:57,395
-You never mentioned a wife!
-Come on.

709
01:11:57,563 --> 01:11:59,480
I hope Mr. Bane can swim.

710
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,959
Alfred, are you well?

711
01:12:20,252 --> 01:12:22,754
As well as can be expected, sir.

712
01:12:24,923 --> 01:12:26,424
My friend, I know you're sick.

713
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:28,426
I can get you the best doctors.

714
01:12:28,635 --> 01:12:31,304
I have seen the best doctors.

715
01:12:31,764 --> 01:12:36,434
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments. It is not civilized.

716
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:41,147
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, Master Bruce.

717
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:45,943
Have you ever...

718
01:12:46,153 --> 01:12:48,613
...regretted your life working here?

719
01:12:49,448 --> 01:12:50,907
Looking after heroes?

720
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:52,367
No, sir.

721
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:57,455
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you.

722
01:13:01,001 --> 01:13:03,378
Not all the heroes wear masks.

723
01:13:07,591 --> 01:13:08,883
Freeze has escaped!

724
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,233
We got this off
the Arkham surveillance camera.

725
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:29,821
Poison Ivy.

726
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:32,490
2 nights ago...

727
01:13:32,658 --> 01:13:36,744
...Gotham Airport, these two arrive
by charter from South America.

728
01:13:37,162 --> 01:13:40,123
They put 10 security guards
in the hospital...

729
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:44,836
...left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine.

730
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:48,339
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang Freeze.

731
01:13:48,507 --> 01:13:51,008
-Commissioner Gordon.
-Excuse me, gentlemen.

732
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:54,345
Poison Ivy...
why would she help Freeze?

733
01:13:54,555 --> 01:13:56,139
She's definitely evil.

734
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:59,142
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love--

735
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,477
I know, then the feeling vanished.

736
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:04,021
I can't believe
we fought over a bad guy.

737
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:06,524
Bad, yes. Guy, no.

738
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:08,484
Well, I'm totally over her.

739
01:14:08,694 --> 01:14:10,403
Me too. Definitely.

740
01:14:11,363 --> 01:14:13,531
-Great stems, though.
-Buds too.

741
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:14,699
Those are nice.

742
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,033
Here we go.

743
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:23,332
It's Nora Fries.

744
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,917
She's still alive.

745
01:14:40,893 --> 01:14:43,728
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease.

746
01:14:43,937 --> 01:14:46,564
He found a cure for the disease
in some stages.

747
01:14:47,566 --> 01:14:48,566
There she is.

748
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:52,236
Get the diamonds.
I'll rescue the bride.

749
01:14:52,446 --> 01:14:54,572
We'll meet back at my place.

750
01:14:55,407 --> 01:14:58,743
In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the bat and bird.

751
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:01,454
You leave those boys to me.

752
01:15:01,914 --> 01:15:02,914
Go!

753
01:15:05,459 --> 01:15:08,211
-Can he save her?
-Her case is too advanced.

754
01:15:08,420 --> 01:15:09,754
But maybe someday...

755
01:15:09,963 --> 01:15:11,589
...with more research....

756
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:19,430
Poison Ivy.

757
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,692
I hate uninvited guests.

758
01:15:38,909 --> 01:15:40,493
My lungs are freezing!

759
01:15:53,423 --> 01:15:54,423
Chilled...

760
01:15:54,633 --> 01:15:55,800
...to perfection.

761
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,058
No beauty.

762
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,521
Just the beast.

763
01:16:28,500 --> 01:16:30,543
Hey, there, pretty birdie.

764
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,670
Give yourself up. If you surrender--

765
01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,046
To you?

766
01:16:36,049 --> 01:16:38,009
Polly want a kiss?

767
01:16:50,397 --> 01:16:54,734
There's something about
an anatomically correct...

768
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:59,030
...rubber suit
that puts fire in a girl's lips.

769
01:17:02,409 --> 01:17:05,870
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? Is it me?

770
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:08,789
Enough sweet talk.

771
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,249
Oh, no.

772
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:15,046
First you'll tell me where Freeze is,
then you're going to jail.

773
01:17:19,384 --> 01:17:20,843
I'm a lover, not a fighter.

774
01:17:21,053 --> 01:17:24,430
That's why every Poison lvy
Action Figure comes with him!

775
01:17:27,893 --> 01:17:30,770
Try not to make a mess when you die.

776
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:02,927
Hold it right there!

777
01:18:24,616 --> 01:18:25,950
Stop!

778
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:31,914
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad bat.

779
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:33,999
You don't need him.

780
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:36,919
You're the star.

781
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:38,921
I can see it now:

782
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:43,342
Your own big, bright signal in the sky.

783
01:18:44,136 --> 01:18:46,137
Let me guide you.

784
01:18:54,813 --> 01:18:56,647
Let me kiss you.

785
01:18:56,815 --> 01:18:58,357
Stop! Don't kiss her.

786
01:18:58,984 --> 01:19:01,819
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally.

787
01:19:02,028 --> 01:19:04,655
-What are you saying?
-Why does she want to kiss us?

788
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:07,283
-I bet her lips are poisoned.
-Poisoned kiss?

789
01:19:07,492 --> 01:19:08,826
You have issues with women!

790
01:19:09,035 --> 01:19:11,495
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you.

791
01:19:11,705 --> 01:19:13,831
Something would be mine, not yours.

792
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:25,426
Exit, Bane.

793
01:19:25,802 --> 01:19:27,344
Exit!

794
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:40,858
Ivy's right. I don't need your help.

795
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:44,862
I'm going solo!

796
01:19:47,532 --> 01:19:48,616
What happened?

797
01:19:48,825 --> 01:19:50,534
How'd they get away?

798
01:20:07,928 --> 01:20:10,888
I've never been good with competition.

799
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:16,060
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

800
01:20:41,086 --> 01:20:42,962
Make yourself right at home.

801
01:20:45,423 --> 01:20:46,632
Where's my wife?

802
01:20:47,050 --> 01:20:50,094
There was nothing l could do.
Batman deactivated her.

803
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:52,763
-She's dead.
-You lie!

804
01:21:17,622 --> 01:21:19,164
I'm sorry.

805
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:24,378
Their bones will turn to ice!

806
01:21:26,506 --> 01:21:29,174
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

807
01:21:30,010 --> 01:21:31,427
Kill them, of course.

808
01:21:31,636 --> 01:21:33,512
But why stop there?

809
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:36,932
Why should only
Batman and Robin die...

810
01:21:37,142 --> 01:21:40,561
...while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

811
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:42,479
Yes!

812
01:21:42,689 --> 01:21:44,815
If I must suffer...

813
01:21:45,025 --> 01:21:47,943
...humanity will suffer with me!

814
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:53,032
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort.

815
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:57,036
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

816
01:21:57,370 --> 01:21:58,537
First...

817
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:01,206
...Gotham.

818
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:03,876
And then...

819
01:22:04,336 --> 01:22:05,502
...the world!

820
01:22:05,879 --> 01:22:08,714
Just what l had in mind.

821
01:22:09,883 --> 01:22:13,135
Everything dead on Earth except us.

822
01:22:13,345 --> 01:22:14,845
A chance for...

823
01:22:15,055 --> 01:22:17,890
...Mother Nature to start again.

824
01:22:18,224 --> 01:22:22,061
Behold, the dawn of a new age.

825
01:22:25,565 --> 01:22:28,734
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals.

826
01:22:29,569 --> 01:22:33,906
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe.

827
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,742
And we shall rule them.

828
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:39,870
For we will be...

829
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,706
...the only two people
left in the world.

830
01:22:43,541 --> 01:22:45,209
Yes.

831
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:46,877
Adam...

832
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,713
...and Evil.

833
01:22:51,424 --> 01:22:53,342
You distract the bat and bird...

834
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:55,052
...while l prepare...

835
01:22:55,261 --> 01:22:56,637
...to freeze...

836
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:58,263
...Gotham!

837
01:23:12,737 --> 01:23:15,864
It's stage one of Macgregor's Syndrome.

838
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,574
I'm sorry.

839
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:21,537
All we can do is
make him comfortable.

840
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,374
Thank you, doctor.

841
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:45,269
Macgregor's Syndrome is
what Fries' wife had.

842
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,480
Alfred's condition is less severe.
Fries' research said...

843
01:23:48,732 --> 01:23:51,108
...he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how.

844
01:23:51,317 --> 01:23:53,193
No one else is even close.

845
01:23:53,403 --> 01:23:57,031
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after Freeze and lvy alone.

846
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,533
-Like hell you do.
-Don't push me right now.

847
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:02,953
Or what? No one can
capture Ivy but the big, bad bat?

848
01:24:03,163 --> 01:24:05,956
Yeah, right.
You want her for yourself, don't you?

849
01:24:06,166 --> 01:24:09,835
I want her so badly, I can taste it.
That's the whole point.

850
01:24:10,670 --> 01:24:15,007
She's done something to us.
She has us fighting over her somehow.

851
01:24:15,175 --> 01:24:18,635
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy.

852
01:24:18,845 --> 01:24:21,263
That's why you
stopped us from kissing.

853
01:24:21,473 --> 01:24:25,017
-You're not thinking straight.
-But I am.

854
01:24:25,185 --> 01:24:27,144
For the first time in a long time.

855
01:24:27,353 --> 01:24:29,813
I want a Robin signal
in the sky, all right?

856
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,982
I'm tired of living in your shadow.

857
01:24:32,192 --> 01:24:33,484
All that ends now.

858
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:40,324
I'm sorry, uncle.

859
01:24:41,659 --> 01:24:43,327
I was too late.

860
01:24:54,172 --> 01:24:56,882
You must do something for me.

861
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:01,011
Find my brother, Wilfred...

862
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,722
...your uncle,
wherever he is and give him...

863
01:25:03,932 --> 01:25:05,015
...this.

864
01:25:05,183 --> 01:25:08,977
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead.

865
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,856
Only family can be trusted.

866
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:14,942
What is it?

867
01:25:15,527 --> 01:25:18,904
It is a sacred trust of two good men...

868
01:25:19,114 --> 01:25:22,199
...whom I have the honor
of calling "sir."

869
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,411
Take it to Wilfred...

870
01:25:26,621 --> 01:25:28,205
...and l implore you...

871
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:30,624
...never open it.

872
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:37,047
You look so like your mother.

873
01:25:40,468 --> 01:25:43,387
<i>Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites.</i>

874
01:25:43,638 --> 01:25:45,556
<i>Everyone who's anyone...</i>

875
01:25:45,723 --> 01:25:47,432
...has flocked to the Observatory...

876
01:25:47,642 --> 01:25:51,812
...and tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope.

877
01:25:56,651 --> 01:26:00,070
And here's the man
of the hour himself...

878
01:26:00,321 --> 01:26:02,322
...Bruce Wayne.

879
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:06,743
Excuse me.

880
01:26:09,581 --> 01:26:10,581
Commissioner.

881
01:26:10,748 --> 01:26:12,249
-How are you?
-Good. You know Julie?

882
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,750
How are you?

883
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:15,169
Good to see you.

884
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:18,755
Young man.

885
01:26:19,465 --> 01:26:22,176
Hello, Gerty. Lovely to see you again.

886
01:26:27,473 --> 01:26:28,682
Thank you.

887
01:26:29,267 --> 01:26:32,102
-Commissioner Gordon.
-Yes?

888
01:26:33,438 --> 01:26:35,147
I've always wondered...

889
01:26:35,356 --> 01:26:39,109
...where does that big,
old batlight come from?

890
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:47,451
Why, it's...

891
01:26:47,619 --> 01:26:49,786
...on top of Police Headquarters.

892
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:51,955
I'd just...

893
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,790
...love to see it.

894
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:56,460
But you probably don't have access.

895
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:57,878
Why, dear lady...

896
01:26:58,963 --> 01:27:01,340
...I am the police commissioner.

897
01:27:01,549 --> 01:27:04,509
I have the keys
right here in my pocket.

898
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,220
Would you like to see it?

899
01:27:24,822 --> 01:27:27,824
Who are you, dear lady?

900
01:27:30,662 --> 01:27:33,538
On second thought,
you're way too old for me.

901
01:27:33,748 --> 01:27:35,415
No, I'm not.

902
01:27:36,584 --> 01:27:38,043
Please...

903
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,920
...come back.

904
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:48,679
What are you doing? Come on.

905
01:27:49,430 --> 01:27:51,848
Show me how the satellites work.

906
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,363
First...

907
01:28:06,531 --> 01:28:09,700
...I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard...

908
01:28:09,867 --> 01:28:13,912
...then l will pull Batman's heart
from his body...

909
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,790
...and feel it freeze in my hands.

910
01:28:21,212 --> 01:28:22,212
Revenge!

911
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,257
Quickly, Bane.

912
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:26,717
Quickly now.

913
01:28:40,148 --> 01:28:42,232
Let there be light.

914
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:50,991
Only family can be trusted?

915
01:28:51,367 --> 01:28:53,327
Well...

916
01:28:53,953 --> 01:28:55,078
...I'm family.

917
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:09,509
<i>Access denied.</i>

918
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,868
I spend my entire life
trying to beat back death.

919
01:29:39,123 --> 01:29:41,583
Everything I've done,
everything I'm...

920
01:29:42,251 --> 01:29:44,252
...capable of doing....

921
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,674
But I can't save you.

922
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:53,887
There's no defeat in death...

923
01:29:54,138 --> 01:29:56,139
...Master Bruce.

924
01:29:57,558 --> 01:30:00,519
Victory comes in defending...

925
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,979
...what we know is right...

926
01:30:03,398 --> 01:30:05,899
...while we still live.

927
01:30:35,138 --> 01:30:36,680
I love you, old man.

928
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:43,061
And l love you too.

<i>Access denied.</i>

01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:20,140
Margaret.

932
01:31:36,908 --> 01:31:38,325
Peg.

<i>Access allowed.</i>

934
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:16,613
The combined power of
the telescope's reflecting crystals...

935
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:17,822
...will complete...

936
01:32:18,032 --> 01:32:19,699
...my freezing engine.

937
01:32:23,454 --> 01:32:26,289
No matter
what they tell you, Mr. Bane...

938
01:32:26,457 --> 01:32:29,125
...it is the size of
your gun that counts.

939
01:32:38,803 --> 01:32:39,844
Where are you going?

940
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:43,014
It's a Robin signal, not a Batlight.
Ivy's calling me.

941
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:45,976
She is Pamela Isley.
She must've stolen Gordon's keys.

942
01:32:46,185 --> 01:32:48,979
-She changed the signal.
-She did it for me, for love.

943
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:51,022
She infected us with pheromones.

944
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,525
I'm under some kind of magic spell?

945
01:32:53,734 --> 01:32:54,901
She wants to kill you.

946
01:32:55,236 --> 01:32:57,779
You'd say anything to keep her
away from me.

947
01:32:57,989 --> 01:32:59,531
To keep her for yourself.

948
01:32:59,949 --> 01:33:02,701
You said being a team
means trusting your partner.

949
01:33:02,910 --> 01:33:07,414
Sometimes, counting on someone
else is the only way to win. Remember?

950
01:33:07,999 --> 01:33:11,751
You weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family.

951
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:13,878
So I'm asking you...

952
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:15,714
...friend, partner...

953
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:17,007
...brother...

954
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:19,843
...will you trust me now?

955
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,941
-All the crystals are in place.
-Thank you.

956
01:33:44,452 --> 01:33:45,702
Hi!

957
01:33:45,911 --> 01:33:47,746
I'm sorry about the door.

958
01:33:48,706 --> 01:33:49,914
Is the party over?

959
01:33:53,044 --> 01:33:54,919
Who is this nutball?

960
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,127
If revenge...

961
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:38,672
...is a dish best served cold...

962
01:34:39,173 --> 01:34:41,675
...then put on your Sunday finest.

963
01:34:42,259 --> 01:34:43,426
It's time...

964
01:34:43,678 --> 01:34:45,428
...to feast!

965
01:34:56,857 --> 01:34:58,024
Tonight...

966
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:01,277
...hell freezes over.

967
01:35:40,651 --> 01:35:43,486

01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:51,286
Uncle Alfred, it's me. Barbara.

970
01:35:51,704 --> 01:35:54,622
<i>I expected you might find</i>
<i>your way down here, child.</i>

971
01:35:54,874 --> 01:35:57,333
<i>I programmed my brain algorithms...</i>

972
01:35:57,501 --> 01:35:59,002
<i>...into the batcomputer...</i>

973
01:35:59,170 --> 01:36:02,672
<i>...and created a virtual simulation.</i>

974
01:36:03,007 --> 01:36:05,133
I'd like to help Batman and Robin.

975
01:36:05,342 --> 01:36:06,926
<i>I anticipated you would...</i>

976
01:36:07,136 --> 01:36:10,513
<i>...and took the liberty</i>
<i>to create something in your size.</i>

977
01:36:11,766 --> 01:36:13,892
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred.

978
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:36,099
Hi there.

979
01:37:40,271 --> 01:37:42,939
Is your thumb the
only part of you that's green?

980
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,276
You will just have to find out.

981
01:37:46,861 --> 01:37:48,736
I want us to be together, but...

982
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:51,614
...you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf.

983
01:37:53,284 --> 01:37:54,284
I need a sign...

984
01:37:55,286 --> 01:37:57,412
How about "Slippery when wet."

985
01:37:57,621 --> 01:37:58,788
...of trust.

986
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:00,665
Tell me your plan.

987
01:38:00,875 --> 01:38:02,458
Kiss me and l'll tell you.

988
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,295
Tell me and I'll kiss you.

989
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:11,509
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun.

990
01:38:11,802 --> 01:38:14,470
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube.

991
01:38:15,723 --> 01:38:17,140
I've got to stop him.

992
01:38:17,349 --> 01:38:18,516
One kiss...

993
01:38:18,726 --> 01:38:19,809
...my love.

994
01:38:20,978 --> 01:38:22,395
For luck.

995
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:37,201
Bad luck, I'm afraid.

996
01:38:38,037 --> 01:38:40,038
Time to die, little Robin.

997
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:45,585
I hate to disappoint you, but...

998
01:38:49,673 --> 01:38:52,342
...rubber lips are immune to
your charms.

999
01:38:59,558 --> 01:39:00,808
See you!

1000
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:05,563
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus.

1001
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:09,734
Sorry, my vines have a crush on you.

1002
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:18,826
Got to go.

1003
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:22,538
So many people to kill,
so little time.

1004
01:39:31,966 --> 01:39:33,675
You're about to become compost.

1005
01:39:41,392 --> 01:39:44,018
Using feminine wiles
to get what you want?

1006
01:39:44,228 --> 01:39:45,228
Trading on your looks?

1007
01:39:45,437 --> 01:39:48,940
Read a book. That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago.

1008
01:39:49,149 --> 01:39:51,192
You give women a bad name.

1009
01:40:11,505 --> 01:40:15,341
As l told Lady Fries,
when I pulled her plug...

1010
01:40:15,926 --> 01:40:17,635
...this is a one-woman show.

1011
01:40:18,053 --> 01:40:19,387
I don't think so.

1012
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:42,160
Curses!

1013
01:40:58,385 --> 01:41:00,136
Freeze is going to ice the city.

1014
01:41:00,304 --> 01:41:01,512
I know.

1015
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,931
-And you are?
-Batgirl.

1016
01:41:04,141 --> 01:41:07,727
That's not P.C.
What about Batperson or Batwoman?

1017
01:41:08,062 --> 01:41:11,355
Bruce, it's me, Barbara.
I found the batcave.

1018
01:41:11,607 --> 01:41:13,024
We must change the locks.

1019
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:15,443
-She knows who we are.
-We must kill her.

1020
01:41:15,652 --> 01:41:17,904
Later. We have work to do.

1021
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:40,176
Let's kick some ice.

1022
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:10,433
We have 11 minutes
to thaw the city.

1023
01:43:37,961 --> 01:43:39,128
Gotcha!

1024
01:43:40,088 --> 01:43:41,088
Now!

1025
01:43:50,849 --> 01:43:52,058
Shield.

1026
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:15,289
I'll finish off the city.

1027
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:17,792
You kill the kids, but...

1028
01:44:18,001 --> 01:44:20,253
...leave me the bat.

1029
01:44:40,482 --> 01:44:41,857
No sign of the snowman.

1030
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:44,360
Maybe he melted.

1031
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,654
No, he's just hibernating.

1032
01:45:04,548 --> 01:45:05,881
These heaters will thaw them.

1033
01:45:13,765 --> 01:45:16,058
I hope you've got
10 million more of those toys.

1034
01:45:16,226 --> 01:45:20,187
-8 minutes and they're ice cubes forever.
-Sunlight could reverse the freezing process.

1035
01:45:20,397 --> 01:45:22,523
-Sunrise isn't for 5 hours.
-Here.

1036
01:45:22,733 --> 01:45:24,108
It's morning in the Congo.

1037
01:45:24,318 --> 01:45:25,359
We'll relay sunlight--

1038
01:45:25,569 --> 01:45:26,819
From below the equator--

1039
01:45:27,029 --> 01:45:29,655
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but....

1040
01:45:31,074 --> 01:45:32,575
Damn?
Damn's not good.

1041
01:45:32,909 --> 01:45:35,453
Those targeting mirrors are frozen.

1042
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:37,246
You thaw the mirrors.

1043
01:46:03,482 --> 01:46:04,940
Tonight's forecast:

1044
01:46:05,150 --> 01:46:07,068
A freeze is coming.

1045
01:46:21,375 --> 01:46:22,875
Bye-bye.

1046
01:46:35,847 --> 01:46:37,098
I got you!

1047
01:46:47,692 --> 01:46:49,777
No. I got you.

1048
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:04,583
It's one of those days!

1049
01:47:58,763 --> 01:48:00,347
Dirty fighter!

1050
01:48:31,421 --> 01:48:32,463
Yay, Batman!

1051
01:48:36,551 --> 01:48:37,593
Oh, no.

1052
01:48:46,102 --> 01:48:47,603
Hey, Freeze.

1053
01:48:47,812 --> 01:48:48,812
The heat is on.

1054
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:05,287
-You all right down there?
-Yeah.

1055
01:49:05,455 --> 01:49:06,580
Here goes.

1056
01:49:35,610 --> 01:49:36,777
Hang on.

1057
01:49:51,668 --> 01:49:53,544
Batman, you're doing it!

1058
01:49:54,713 --> 01:49:56,630
You've lost, Freeze.

1059
01:49:57,215 --> 01:49:58,215
I think not.

1060
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,218
Bombs away, Batman.

1061
01:50:25,577 --> 01:50:29,121
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1062
01:50:55,982 --> 01:50:58,692
-What should we do now?
-Pray.

1063
01:51:04,574 --> 01:51:06,075
Hang on!

1064
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:10,788
Grab onto my belt!

1065
01:51:30,433 --> 01:51:33,060
-Thank you, Batman!
-Thank you!

1066
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:37,398
Need a ride?

1067
01:51:48,535 --> 01:51:51,036
-Most of Gotham's still frozen.
-It's midnight.

1068
01:51:51,454 --> 01:51:53,997
Telescope's gone.
There's no way to thaw the city.

1069
01:51:54,207 --> 01:51:57,251
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius.

1070
01:51:57,460 --> 01:51:58,460
I'm on it.

1071
01:51:59,129 --> 01:52:00,379
No, I'm on it.

1072
01:52:06,344 --> 01:52:07,720
Have to do it upside down.

1073
01:52:07,929 --> 01:52:10,514
Men!
Everything the hard way.

1074
01:52:13,143 --> 01:52:15,144
You're pretty good at this, little girl.

1075
01:52:16,771 --> 01:52:19,273
Watch and learn, little boy.

1076
01:53:26,257 --> 01:53:29,051
Looks like it's gonna be a beautiful day.

1077
01:53:36,559 --> 01:53:39,561
I'm taking you back
to Arkham Asylum.

1078
01:53:40,730 --> 01:53:42,231
Go on.

1079
01:53:43,066 --> 01:53:44,441
Kill me too.

1080
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:46,276
Just as you killed my wife.

1081
01:53:46,486 --> 01:53:48,070
I didn't kill your wife.

1082
01:53:53,159 --> 01:53:57,162
As l told Lady Fries
when I pulled her plug...

1083
01:53:57,497 --> 01:53:59,832
...this is a one-woman show.

1084
01:54:05,588 --> 01:54:07,506
But she's not dead.

1085
01:54:08,258 --> 01:54:10,175
We found her, restored her.

1086
01:54:10,718 --> 01:54:12,928
She's still frozen alive...

1087
01:54:13,221 --> 01:54:15,013
...waiting for you to find a cure.

1088
01:54:16,266 --> 01:54:17,975
She lives?

1089
01:54:18,184 --> 01:54:19,434
Yes.

1090
01:54:20,270 --> 01:54:23,605
But vengeance isn't power.
Anyone can take a life.

1091
01:54:24,107 --> 01:54:25,732
But to give life...

1092
01:54:26,192 --> 01:54:29,069
...that's true power.
A power you once had.

1093
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:32,114
She's alive.

1094
01:54:37,787 --> 01:54:39,454
So I'm asking you.

1095
01:54:40,456 --> 01:54:42,040
Victor Fries...

1096
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,793
...help me save another life.

1097
01:54:45,211 --> 01:54:48,213
Show me how to cure
Macgregor's Syndrome, stage one.

1098
01:54:48,715 --> 01:54:52,551
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved.

1099
01:54:53,469 --> 01:54:55,554
He's still inside you, Victor.

1100
01:54:56,556 --> 01:54:57,639
Buried...

1101
01:54:57,891 --> 01:54:59,975
...deep beneath the snow.

1102
01:55:02,645 --> 01:55:04,313
Will you help me...

1103
01:55:05,815 --> 01:55:07,274
...doctor?

1104
01:55:31,674 --> 01:55:33,675
Take 2 of these...

1105
01:55:34,928 --> 01:55:36,845
...and call me in the morning.

1106
01:55:47,440 --> 01:55:50,067
I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at Arkham.

1107
01:55:50,276 --> 01:55:52,694
You'll be able to continue
your research there.

1108
01:56:16,302 --> 01:56:18,553
All we can do now is wait...

1109
01:56:19,305 --> 01:56:21,139
...and hope.

1110
01:56:34,737 --> 01:56:36,154
He loves me.

1111
01:56:36,781 --> 01:56:38,532
He loves me not.

1112
01:56:40,076 --> 01:56:41,660
He loves me.

1113
01:56:42,912 --> 01:56:44,913
He loves me not.

1114
01:56:47,375 --> 01:56:49,209
He loves me.

1115
01:56:50,753 --> 01:56:52,587
He loves me not.

1116
01:56:54,882 --> 01:56:56,550
He loves me.

1117
01:56:58,428 --> 01:56:59,553
Not!

1118
01:57:01,431 --> 01:57:02,931
Surprise.

1119
01:57:03,099 --> 01:57:05,100
I'm your new cellmate.

1120
01:57:07,270 --> 01:57:10,731
And l've come
to make your life a living hell.

1121
01:57:11,733 --> 01:57:14,735
Prepare for a bitter harvest.

1122
01:57:18,406 --> 01:57:19,614
Winter...

1123
01:57:19,907 --> 01:57:21,908
...has come at last.

1124
01:58:03,117 --> 01:58:04,659
Alfred.

1125
01:58:07,580 --> 01:58:08,580
Are you...?

1126
01:58:08,748 --> 01:58:13,335
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping.

1127
01:58:13,836 --> 01:58:15,670
And quite well, it seems!

1128
01:58:16,089 --> 01:58:17,506
Thanks to you, son.

1129
01:58:17,673 --> 01:58:19,883
Thanks to you all.

1130
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:21,718
Well done, Bruce.

1131
01:58:22,053 --> 01:58:24,137
You too. Well done.

1132
01:58:25,515 --> 01:58:27,015
I got one question.

1133
01:58:27,350 --> 01:58:31,061
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1134
01:58:31,229 --> 01:58:33,522
It's the first time l fell
and you weren't there.

1135
01:58:34,065 --> 01:58:35,482
I figured you could handle it.

1136
01:58:35,650 --> 01:58:40,278
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win.

1137
01:58:43,157 --> 01:58:46,535
Excuse me. I'm the one
who kicked Ivy's botanical butt.

1138
01:58:46,702 --> 01:58:47,911
Yeah, that was me.

1139
01:58:48,121 --> 01:58:50,705
I did it all by myself. That was me.

1140
01:58:50,915 --> 01:58:53,208
You are going back to school.

1141
01:58:53,376 --> 01:58:55,085
You'll never win this argument.

1142
01:59:00,216 --> 01:59:01,383
Partners?

1143
01:59:06,389 --> 01:59:18,483
Partners.

1144
01:59:21,946 --> 01:59:24,072
We're going to need a bigger cave.

1145
02:04:47,688 --> 02:04:49,689
