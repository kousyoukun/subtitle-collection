1
00:02:18,253 --> 00:02:19,713
I want a car

2
00:02:21,965 --> 00:02:23,675
Chicks dig the car

3
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:26,678
This is why Superman works alone

4
00:02:34,853 --> 00:02:38,606
Do try and bring this one
back in one piece, sir!

5
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:09,804
Don't wait up, Al

6
00:03:10,013 --> 00:03:12,057
I'll cancel the pizzas

7
00:03:27,989 --> 00:03:29,449
Batman,

8
00:03:29,616 --> 00:03:31,826
a new villain has commandeered
the Gotham Museum

9
00:03:32,035 --> 00:03:33,912
He's frozen
the antiquities wing

10
00:03:34,162 --> 00:03:36,539
He's turned
the security guards into ice

11
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,000
He's calling himself, "Mr Freeze"

12
00:03:39,292 --> 00:03:41,086
Mr Freeze

13
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:06,903
Stop! Drop your weapon

14
00:04:07,153 --> 00:04:08,405
or we'll shoot!

15
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,878
The Iceman Cometh

16
00:04:25,422 --> 00:04:27,632
Please, show some mercy

17
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,175
Mercy?!

18
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:36,141
I'm afraid that my condition has
left me cold to your pleas of mercy

19
00:04:54,451 --> 00:04:55,994
In this universe

20
00:04:56,244 --> 00:04:58,705
there's only one absolute

21
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,750
Everything

22
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,752
freezes

23
00:05:09,549 --> 00:05:10,467
Hi, Freeze

24
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:11,926
I'm Batman

25
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:33,281
You're not sending me to the cooler

26
00:05:51,216 --> 00:05:52,133
Nice catch

27
00:05:52,425 --> 00:05:53,802
You break it, you buy it

28
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,304
Grab the gem!
Kill the heroes!

29
00:06:10,819 --> 00:06:12,612
Kill them! Kill them!

30
00:06:13,655 --> 00:06:15,615
Destroy everything!

31
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,169
It's the hockey team from hell

32
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:03,913
Get the ice

33
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:05,665
I'll get the Iceman

34
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:32,942
Thanks

35
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,293
Sweet

36
00:07:55,048 --> 00:07:55,715
I got mine

37
00:07:56,424 --> 00:07:57,801
Where's yours?

38
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:01,137
What killed the dinosaurs?

39
00:08:01,763 --> 00:08:03,640
The Ice Age!

40
00:08:55,859 --> 00:08:57,026
Hit me, boys

41
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:01,823
Thanks for playing

42
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,477
I was hoping you'd drop in

43
00:10:28,618 --> 00:10:29,786
Watch the numbers

44
00:10:29,994 --> 00:10:32,455
for they are
the harbingers of your doom

45
00:10:32,664 --> 00:10:33,665
Can you feel it coming?

46
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:36,751
The icy cold of space

47
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:42,173
At 30,000 feet,
your heart will freeze

48
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,551
and beat no more

49
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:57,897
After you're frozen, your icy tomb
will plummet back to Gotham

50
00:10:58,148 --> 00:10:59,607
Freeze, you're mad

51
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:02,569
This capsule explodes,
it'll slaughter thousands

52
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:03,903
Freeze well

53
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,888
-Who invited you?
-I was hanging around

54
00:11:30,096 --> 00:11:32,849
I thought you'd stay in the museum,
round up some thugs

55
00:11:33,099 --> 00:11:35,810
How about, "Nice to see you
Thanks for saving my life"

56
00:11:49,032 --> 00:11:49,783
A Batbomb?

57
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:52,786
We must blow this up
before it turns Gotham into a crater

58
00:11:55,038 --> 00:11:56,122
Now what, call a taxi?!

59
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,291
Watch the first step!

60
00:11:59,542 --> 00:12:00,543
Surf's up!

61
00:12:35,453 --> 00:12:36,913
Gotcha!

62
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,379
Cowabunga!

63
00:13:02,939 --> 00:13:05,316
He's freezing the furnace!

64
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:47,067
I got him

65
00:13:54,282 --> 00:13:55,283
Stay cool

66
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:56,910
Birdboy

67
00:14:06,669 --> 00:14:10,423
Can you be cold?
You have 11 minutes to thaw the bird

68
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,801
Will you chase the villain

69
00:14:12,967 --> 00:14:13,885
or save him?

70
00:14:15,178 --> 00:14:16,429
Emotion makes you weak

71
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,057
That's why this day is mine

72
00:14:20,642 --> 00:14:22,519
I'll kill you next time!

73
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,565
Did we get him?

74
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,496
Drats!

75
00:15:23,705 --> 00:15:28,585
My experiment to mate the orchid and
the rattlesnake has failed again

76
00:15:29,335 --> 00:15:33,882
but I still have hope for
the animal-plant crossbreedings

77
00:15:35,633 --> 00:15:37,927
If I can only find
the right dose of venom

78
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:41,598
these plants will be able to
fight back, like animals

79
00:15:42,348 --> 00:15:44,142
I will have given flora

80
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:48,897
a chance against
the thoughtless ravages of man

81
00:15:52,108 --> 00:15:53,485
Personal note:

82
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:56,071
My work would proceed faster

83
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:59,783
if Dr Woodrue didn't whisk
my venom samples

84
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:02,786
back to his mysterious
Gilgamesh Wing

85
00:16:03,453 --> 00:16:05,663
Why won't he let me in the lab?

86
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:09,959
What is he doing in there?

87
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,773
Ladies and gentlemen
of the un-United Nations

88
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,316
and

89
00:16:35,068 --> 00:16:36,528
our mystery bidder

90
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:38,655
may I present

91
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:40,907
Antonio Diego

92
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:44,619
serial murderer, serving life

93
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:45,704
in prison

94
00:16:45,954 --> 00:16:47,914
and sole surviving

95
00:16:48,164 --> 00:16:49,708
volunteer

96
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,378
And what a charmer he is

97
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:59,050
By merely drilling three
concentric holes directly

98
00:16:59,426 --> 00:17:03,096
into Antonio's cranial cavity
I have

99
00:17:03,346 --> 00:17:07,308
created viaducts into
the most primitive part of his brain

100
00:17:07,976 --> 00:17:10,186
the limbic system

101
00:17:12,605 --> 00:17:14,566
And now I add

102
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:16,693
my Super-Soldier Serum

103
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:18,528
code-named

104
00:17:19,112 --> 00:17:20,113
"Venom"

105
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,450
to which I add
my very own recipe of steroids

106
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,326
and toxins

107
00:17:27,203 --> 00:17:28,663
Plug him in

108
00:17:28,913 --> 00:17:30,373
Time to scream

109
00:18:04,074 --> 00:18:05,533
Genius!

110
00:18:05,825 --> 00:18:06,910
Behold

111
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,788
the ideal killing machine!

112
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,165
I call this little number

113
00:18:12,665 --> 00:18:13,750
"Bane"

114
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,294
Bane of Humanity!

115
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:18,421
Imagine it

116
00:18:19,089 --> 00:18:22,842
Your own private army made up of
thousands of these super-soldiers

117
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:25,470
Bidding begins at a mere

118
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:27,055
10 million!

119
00:18:27,347 --> 00:18:28,264
Turbo!

120
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,517
Show off for Daddy

121
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,685
Dr Isley

122
00:19:16,104 --> 00:19:18,314
Welcome to my parlor

123
00:19:19,607 --> 00:19:20,608
What?

124
00:19:21,317 --> 00:19:22,318
You monster!

125
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:24,070
How could you?!

126
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:27,657
Our original sponsor had
no stomach for military applications

127
00:19:27,824 --> 00:19:29,951
He cut the funding for our work

128
00:19:30,493 --> 00:19:32,037
Without your research

129
00:19:32,287 --> 00:19:33,747
I couldn't have come this far

130
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:34,873
Join me

131
00:19:35,081 --> 00:19:38,334
The two of us,
entwined, side by side

132
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:39,335
Join you?

133
00:19:40,128 --> 00:19:44,591
I have spent my life trying to
protect plants from extinction

134
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:46,134
and now you

135
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:48,636
corrupt my research

136
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,474
into some maniacal scheme for
world domination

137
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,227
When I get through

138
00:19:56,478 --> 00:20:01,107
you won't be able to get a job
teaching high school chemistry

139
00:20:01,357 --> 00:20:02,734
Do you hear me?!

140
00:20:02,942 --> 00:20:05,153
You psycho!

141
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:08,656
Well

142
00:20:08,865 --> 00:20:10,825
I can respect your opinion

143
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:13,661
Sadly, I'm not good at rejection

144
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:15,997
I'm afraid you'll have to die

145
00:20:41,731 --> 00:20:45,568
Let the poisons and toxins
burn a grave for you

146
00:20:45,735 --> 00:20:48,405
deep into the earth
you love so much!

147
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,198
Bye-bye, dear!

148
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,117
Fellow maniacs

149
00:20:52,367 --> 00:20:53,910
bidding

150
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,870
begins!

151
00:21:02,419 --> 00:21:06,339
Gotham University Labs
security video, 2 years ago

152
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:09,467
Dr Victor Fries

153
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:14,013
2-time Olympic decathlete and Nobel
Prize winner for molecular biology

154
00:21:14,431 --> 00:21:16,725
After his wife
contracted a rare disease

155
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,184
Macgregor's Syndrome

156
00:21:18,435 --> 00:21:21,604
he hoped to freeze her in a cryogenic
sleep until he could find a cure

157
00:21:21,771 --> 00:21:24,441
Now, here's where
everything goes north

158
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:32,615
That's got to hurt

159
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:35,201
That liquid is 50 below

160
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,454
But, he survived somehow

161
00:21:38,246 --> 00:21:40,707
The cryo-solution mutated his body

162
00:21:45,628 --> 00:21:48,089
-What happened to his wife?
-No one knows

163
00:21:48,256 --> 00:21:49,716
She's presumed dead

164
00:21:49,966 --> 00:21:51,926
Freeze needs
extreme cold to survive

165
00:21:52,093 --> 00:21:57,057
His cryo-suit uses diamond-enhanced
lasers to keep him at zero degrees

166
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:01,436
If it's ice the Iceman wants

167
00:22:12,072 --> 00:22:13,156
Coming, sir

168
00:22:14,824 --> 00:22:16,034
Yes, sir?

169
00:22:16,451 --> 00:22:17,994
We need the Wayne diamonds

170
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:19,996
We going to trap a snowman?

171
00:22:20,955 --> 00:22:24,793
Yes, right after you spend
1 0 hours in the simulator, training

172
00:22:25,001 --> 00:22:28,421
I made a mistake I'm sorry
It won't happen again

173
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,673
You were reckless
and almost got killed

174
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,134
I'm fine! See!
Me, here, alive!

175
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:36,429
How we supposed to work together
if you won't trust me?

176
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,434
How indeed?

177
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:44,104
He's overeager, he's impulsive

178
00:22:44,312 --> 00:22:46,606
I can't trust him not to get hurt

179
00:22:47,273 --> 00:22:50,777
Perhaps the truth is
you really don't trust anyone

180
00:22:51,277 --> 00:22:54,280
Don't tell me
you're on his side again

181
00:22:54,989 --> 00:22:57,283
Despite all your talents

182
00:22:57,534 --> 00:23:00,704
you're still just
a novice in the ways of family

183
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:01,705
Master Dick

184
00:23:02,038 --> 00:23:04,332
follows the same star as you

185
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:07,544
but gets there by his own course

186
00:23:08,294 --> 00:23:11,881
You must learn to trust him,
for that is the nature of family

187
00:23:12,882 --> 00:23:14,676
I trust you, Alfred

188
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:18,138
But I shan't be here forever

189
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:23,476
Good night, Master Bruce

190
00:23:25,895 --> 00:23:27,105
Good night, Alfred

191
00:23:47,751 --> 00:23:49,711
Oh, dear, Master Bruce

192
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,297
Good gracious, what a tumble

193
00:23:52,589 --> 00:23:54,716
There's a brave boy

194
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:04,601
Yes, sir

195
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:08,730
I am so pleased you won the bidding,
Your Supreme Ruthlessness

196
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:12,150
We're making the final modifications
on Bane right now

197
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:17,155
We'll have a flawless super-soldier
out to you tomorrow by overnight mail

198
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:40,136
Dr Isley?

199
00:24:41,096 --> 00:24:42,722
Pamela?

200
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:45,433
You look great

201
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:48,144
Especially for a dead woman

202
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,147
Hello, Jason

203
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,110
I think I've had a change of heart

204
00:24:55,443 --> 00:24:56,611
Or quite

205
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,113
literally

206
00:24:59,322 --> 00:25:03,243
the animal-plant toxins had
a rather unique effect on me

207
00:25:03,451 --> 00:25:06,121
They replaced my blood with aloe

208
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:09,374
my skin with chlorophyll

209
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:11,167
and filled

210
00:25:11,418 --> 00:25:13,128
my lips

211
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:25,724
with venom

212
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,271
And, Jason, one other thing

213
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:35,775
I probably
should have mentioned this earlier

214
00:25:36,818 --> 00:25:37,819
I'm

215
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:40,071
poison

216
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,580
It's a jungle in here

217
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,750
I am Nature's arm

218
00:25:52,709 --> 00:25:54,335
her spirit

219
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:56,004
her will!

220
00:25:57,338 --> 00:25:59,716
Hell, I am Mother Nature

221
00:25:59,966 --> 00:26:01,926
And the time has come

222
00:26:02,177 --> 00:26:03,970
for plants to take back

223
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,973
the world so rightfully ours

224
00:26:07,223 --> 00:26:08,683
because it's not nice

225
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,604
to fool with Mother Nature

226
00:26:18,735 --> 00:26:20,862
"Wayne Enterprises"

227
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:27,243
Coming, Bane, darling

228
00:26:27,827 --> 00:26:29,537
We've got a plane to catch

229
00:26:45,387 --> 00:26:47,972
l'm Mrlcicle

230
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:50,100
l'm MrTen Below

231
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:51,768
Sing! Sing!

232
00:26:57,565 --> 00:26:59,275
Come on, sing!

233
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:01,903
Louder! Come on!

234
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:03,988
Sing! Sing! Sing!

235
00:27:04,197 --> 00:27:05,907
He's Mr White Christmas

236
00:27:06,408 --> 00:27:07,659
Louder!

237
00:27:09,494 --> 00:27:11,037
He's Mr lcicle

238
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:13,498
Freezy

239
00:27:13,957 --> 00:27:15,750
I'm feeling hot

240
00:27:15,959 --> 00:27:17,836
I find that unlikely

241
00:27:18,586 --> 00:27:22,090
So my hair is
brittle and my skin is dry

242
00:27:22,298 --> 00:27:24,426
I'd weather blizzards to have you

243
00:27:24,718 --> 00:27:27,262
You're the most perfect man
I've ever known

244
00:27:27,429 --> 00:27:29,556
Let's heat things up

245
00:27:29,806 --> 00:27:32,267
My passion thaws
for my bride alone

246
00:27:34,144 --> 00:27:36,438
Talk about your cold shoulder

247
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:42,902
Frosty!

248
00:27:43,153 --> 00:27:44,320
Yeah, boss?

249
00:27:45,447 --> 00:27:46,698
Energy

250
00:27:47,907 --> 00:27:50,452
Battling the Bat
exhausted my power

251
00:27:55,331 --> 00:27:56,332
But

252
00:27:57,542 --> 00:27:59,919
I was successful nevertheless

253
00:28:01,087 --> 00:28:02,380
Absolutely, boss

254
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,175
One more giant diamond of this size

255
00:28:05,383 --> 00:28:08,386
and my freezing engine
will be complete

256
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:13,016
I will freeze the city

257
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:16,311
Then I will hold Gotham ransom

258
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:18,855
Unless the city bows
to my demands

259
00:28:19,105 --> 00:28:20,815
it's winter forever
in Gotham

260
00:28:21,483 --> 00:28:23,860
The city fathers
will have no choice

261
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:27,989
but to give me the billions
I need to complete my research

262
00:28:30,283 --> 00:28:32,327
so I can find a cure

263
00:28:33,661 --> 00:28:35,038
Leave us

264
00:28:35,288 --> 00:28:36,373
Sure, boss

265
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,627
We need quality time

266
00:28:57,227 --> 00:29:00,146
Soon we will be together
once more

267
00:29:01,147 --> 00:29:02,691
Soon

268
00:29:25,714 --> 00:29:26,798
I'll get it

269
00:29:37,183 --> 00:29:39,936
I must've dozed off
My sincerest apologies

270
00:29:40,186 --> 00:29:41,730
No apology necessary

271
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,733
It's the first time it's happened
in thirty years

272
00:29:57,746 --> 00:29:59,456
Please be looking for me

273
00:29:59,748 --> 00:30:02,584
Actually, I'm looking for
Alfred Pennyworth

274
00:30:07,172 --> 00:30:08,715
Uncle Alfred!

275
00:30:08,965 --> 00:30:10,258
My dear

276
00:30:10,467 --> 00:30:12,260
Oh, my dear

277
00:30:12,469 --> 00:30:14,929
what a most wonderful surprise

278
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:18,058
How did you manage
to come here all the way from England?

279
00:30:18,308 --> 00:30:21,061
My dear, you are so kind
to your old uncle

280
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:22,687
Uncle?

281
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:29,444
Barbara is the daughter
of my dear sister Margaret

282
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:33,448
Both my parents were killed
in a car accident 5 years ago

283
00:30:33,615 --> 00:30:35,992
Uncle Alfred's been supporting me
ever since

284
00:30:36,201 --> 00:30:37,911
-You have?
-Secrets, Al?

285
00:30:38,161 --> 00:30:42,290
Secrets are a virtual prerequisite
in this house

286
00:30:42,499 --> 00:30:44,125
Don't you think, sir?

287
00:30:44,626 --> 00:30:45,543
I'm on break from--

288
00:30:45,794 --> 00:30:48,797
Oxbridge Academy,
Alfred's alma mater

289
00:30:49,172 --> 00:30:52,008
The new computer sciences division

290
00:30:52,217 --> 00:30:55,136
-How'd you know?
-Says so on the patch on your sweater

291
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:03,812
-What is it? It's beautiful
-You can say that again

292
00:31:04,396 --> 00:31:07,148
It's a competition racer
I've been fixing it up

293
00:31:07,357 --> 00:31:08,608
I'll show you how to ride it

294
00:31:08,858 --> 00:31:10,652
You certainly will not!

295
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,447
Don't worry, Uncle Alfred
I'm terrified of these things

296
00:31:14,656 --> 00:31:16,866
Barbara, I hope you'll stay with us

297
00:31:17,534 --> 00:31:18,993
Oh, I don't know

298
00:31:19,244 --> 00:31:22,414
All this luxury really isn't
my style, but

299
00:31:23,206 --> 00:31:24,374
yeah, I'd love to

300
00:31:25,041 --> 00:31:26,334
Then it's settled

301
00:31:26,876 --> 00:31:29,003
But, sir, we

302
00:31:29,379 --> 00:31:31,506
we do get so busy here

303
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:32,799
Don't be silly

304
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,634
After all, she's family

305
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:53,111
Uncle Alfred?

306
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,073
I came to tuck you in

307
00:31:57,282 --> 00:31:59,576
You came to tuck me in?

308
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:01,578
That's quite a switch

309
00:32:02,912 --> 00:32:04,372
What're you working on?

310
00:32:04,581 --> 00:32:08,084
I'm trying to find my brother,
your Uncle Wilfred

311
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:12,213
He's first butler
to the Maharajah of Miranjapore

312
00:32:12,422 --> 00:32:15,341
But Miranjapore is a floating court

313
00:32:15,592 --> 00:32:17,385
It travels through India

314
00:32:17,594 --> 00:32:19,387
I remember Mom getting postcards

315
00:32:19,596 --> 00:32:22,766
So Wilfred can be
rather difficult to find

316
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,270
I don't suppose they have
fax machines on elephants

317
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:31,608
I've been trying to reach him
with no success

318
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:35,403
When one grows ancient,
one yearns for family

319
00:32:37,781 --> 00:32:40,617
I have the same picture of Mom
by my bed

320
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,868
Peg?

321
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,704
My nickname for sweet Margaret

322
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,626
It's good to see you again

323
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:51,586
I've missed you

324
00:32:52,754 --> 00:32:54,631
As I have you

325
00:32:55,965 --> 00:32:57,425
Sleep well, child

326
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,303
You sleep

327
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:04,099
Go to bed

328
00:34:09,205 --> 00:34:10,498
Good morning, Gotham

329
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:15,503
lt's Gossip Gerty reporting to you
direct from the Gotham Observatory

330
00:34:15,712 --> 00:34:20,175
where billionaire Bruce Wayne,
chairman of Wayne Enterprises

331
00:34:20,425 --> 00:34:25,388
is about to make yet another
legendary contribution to the city

332
00:34:26,556 --> 00:34:29,017
Gotham Observatory, Bane

333
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:31,227
And step on it

334
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,605
Step

335
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:47,035
My father told me, "To succeed,
we need only pick a star and follow it"

336
00:34:47,911 --> 00:34:52,040
So Wayne Enterprises is donating
the world's most advanced telescope

337
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:55,377
to Gotham 's
Observatory Restoration Project

338
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:56,878
With any luck

339
00:34:57,170 --> 00:35:00,006
this telescope will give
future generations a chance

340
00:35:00,256 --> 00:35:02,217
to follow their own stars

341
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,637
Brucy

342
00:35:05,887 --> 00:35:09,808
is it true that this new telescope
can see around the globe?

343
00:35:10,058 --> 00:35:12,727
Yes If you'll watch
these monitors right here

344
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:18,483
Satellites in orbit allow us to reflect
light from anywhere on the planet

345
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:22,278
From here, we'll be able
to see the sky anywhere on Earth

346
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,240
and through this
intricate network of satellites

347
00:35:25,448 --> 00:35:29,744
reflect it back to our
very own Gotham City for observation

348
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,330
Just don't point it at my bedroom

349
00:35:37,502 --> 00:35:40,255
Brucy, you and the exquisite
Julie Madison

350
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:42,048
have been going out forever

351
00:35:42,298 --> 00:35:44,426
Are you going to tie the knot?

352
00:35:44,676 --> 00:35:45,427
Marriage?

353
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,637
Marriage?

354
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:50,098
You want to give me a hand here?

355
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,767
Bruce and I are recklessly in love

356
00:35:52,976 --> 00:35:56,646
And that's most certainly
enough for us  for now

357
00:35:58,148 --> 00:36:01,067
If you will follow me,
I'll show you the central control grid

358
00:36:01,526 --> 00:36:03,153
You're a lot of help

359
00:36:04,946 --> 00:36:06,322
Miss, you need to stop

360
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:07,782
Move, fascist bulldog!

361
00:36:07,949 --> 00:36:10,160
-You need an appointment--
-No, I don't!

362
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,288
Miss, you're not authorized
to be up here

363
00:36:13,496 --> 00:36:14,664
She has no pass, sir

364
00:36:14,831 --> 00:36:17,584
Little overly protective,
but you won't hurt me, Miss--?

365
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,461
Dr Pamela Isley

366
00:36:19,669 --> 00:36:20,837
Doctor

367
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:22,547
what can I do for you?

368
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:25,133
Actually, I already
work for you, or did

369
00:36:25,383 --> 00:36:27,969
Your arboreal preservation project
in South America

370
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,806
We cut our funding
There was a conflict of ideologies

371
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,641
Dr Woodrue was a lunatic

372
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:34,934
I see you knew him

373
00:36:35,226 --> 00:36:38,146
Yes That lab burnt down last week
I'm glad you escaped

374
00:36:39,522 --> 00:36:43,651
I have here a proposal showing
how Wayne Enterprises can immediately

375
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,863
cease all actions
that toxify our environment

376
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,324
Forget the stars,
look here at the earth

377
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,117
our mother, our womb

378
00:36:51,368 --> 00:36:54,371
She deserves your loyalty
and protection

379
00:36:55,372 --> 00:36:57,165
And yet, you spoil her lands

380
00:36:57,874 --> 00:36:58,958
poison her oceans

381
00:36:59,376 --> 00:37:00,377
blacken her skies!

382
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:01,878
You're killing her!

383
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,508
Your intentions are noble,
but no diesel fuel for heat

384
00:37:06,716 --> 00:37:11,513
no coolants to preserve food,
millions of people would die

385
00:37:11,763 --> 00:37:14,432
Acceptable losses
in the battle to save the planet

386
00:37:15,350 --> 00:37:17,644
People come first, Dr Isley

387
00:37:19,729 --> 00:37:20,897
Mammals!

388
00:37:21,731 --> 00:37:23,692
A day of reckoning is coming

389
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,984
That's right

390
00:37:25,193 --> 00:37:27,862
The same plants and flowers
that saw you

391
00:37:28,988 --> 00:37:30,949
crawl from the primordial soup

392
00:37:31,199 --> 00:37:35,495
will reclaim this planet
and there will be no one to protect you!

393
00:37:39,582 --> 00:37:41,710
You must be new in town

394
00:37:41,918 --> 00:37:42,836
In Gotham City

395
00:37:43,044 --> 00:37:45,338
Batman and Robin protect us

396
00:37:45,588 --> 00:37:48,216
even from plants and flowers

397
00:37:51,594 --> 00:37:53,388
Maybe you'd like to meet them

398
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:56,433
Caped crusaders are
going to help us auction

399
00:37:56,683 --> 00:37:59,227
a diamond to raise money
for our botanical gardens

400
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:04,065
Just a few mammals doing what
we can for the world's plants

401
00:38:04,441 --> 00:38:05,900
Thank you all for coming

402
00:38:06,067 --> 00:38:07,318
Good day, Doctor

403
00:38:16,786 --> 00:38:18,913
Batman and Robin

404
00:38:19,456 --> 00:38:22,876
militant arm
of the warm-blooded oppressors

405
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:27,380
animal protectors of the status quo

406
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:29,924
First

407
00:38:30,091 --> 00:38:33,762
I'll rid myself of the fur
and feathered pests

408
00:38:34,971 --> 00:38:37,015
And then Gotham

409
00:38:37,265 --> 00:38:38,725
will be mine

410
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,685
for the greening

411
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,208
Excuse me, chief

412
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,127
I got something here
you might want to see

413
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,720
I hate when people talk
during the movie

414
00:39:35,156 --> 00:39:37,283
One more diamond, my love

415
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:40,036
One more

416
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,629
"Bruce Wayne Diamonds"

417
00:39:52,048 --> 00:39:53,299
Very nice

418
00:40:38,219 --> 00:40:40,722
Ladies and gentlemen

419
00:40:42,182 --> 00:40:44,934
Gossip Gerty
of "Good Morning Gotham" and I

420
00:40:45,101 --> 00:40:49,314
welcome you
to the gem of the evening

421
00:40:50,398 --> 00:40:52,776
Our own Commissioner Gordon

422
00:40:53,234 --> 00:40:54,486
displaying

423
00:40:54,736 --> 00:40:58,073
the famed Heart of Isis,
on loan

424
00:40:58,323 --> 00:41:02,869
from the collection of my
close personal friend, Bruce Wayne

425
00:41:06,122 --> 00:41:07,749
Think Freeze will take the bait?

426
00:41:08,166 --> 00:41:09,542
He'll be here

427
00:41:10,335 --> 00:41:13,004
to dance with one
of our fabulous flowers

428
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,758
the famed diamond
draped around her neck

429
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:22,097
Let's start the bidding!

430
00:41:22,639 --> 00:41:25,183
I'll give 10,000 for the orchid!

431
00:41:27,268 --> 00:41:29,562
20,000 for the tiger lily!

432
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,732
And I bid

433
00:41:32,982 --> 00:41:36,736
30,000 dollars
for the lovely magnolia!

434
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,827
Boys, please

435
00:41:44,202 --> 00:41:45,912
let's show some gusto!

436
00:43:53,123 --> 00:43:54,290
Hi, there

437
00:43:55,125 --> 00:43:57,252
And you are?

438
00:43:57,711 --> 00:43:59,337
Poison

439
00:43:59,587 --> 00:44:01,131
Poison Ivy

440
00:44:11,725 --> 00:44:14,436
Why not send junior home early?

441
00:44:14,853 --> 00:44:18,106
I've got some wild oats to sow

442
00:44:19,816 --> 00:44:21,609
On the other hand

443
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:25,697
youth does have its advantages

444
00:44:26,489 --> 00:44:29,034
Endurance, stamina

445
00:44:29,659 --> 00:44:32,037
Forget the geriatric Bat

446
00:44:32,328 --> 00:44:33,872
Come, join me

447
00:44:34,080 --> 00:44:36,291
My garden needs tending

448
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:38,293
I'll take it from here, pal

449
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,587
Wouldn't you like the earrings too?

450
00:44:41,463 --> 00:44:45,759
Some lucky boy's
about to hit the honey pot

451
00:44:46,092 --> 00:44:50,055
I'll include an evening of my company
for the winner

452
00:44:50,847 --> 00:44:53,224
I'll bring everything you see here

453
00:44:53,391 --> 00:44:56,728
plus everything you don't

454
00:44:58,563 --> 00:45:01,483
I bid 50,000 dollars for Poison Ivy!

455
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,488
100,000!

456
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:09,032
And I'll bid

457
00:45:09,282 --> 00:45:12,452
500,000 dollars!

458
00:45:14,371 --> 00:45:15,455
One million dollars

459
00:45:17,165 --> 00:45:19,376
-2 million
-You don't have it 3 million

460
00:45:19,584 --> 00:45:21,044
I'll borrow it from you Four million

461
00:45:22,337 --> 00:45:23,171
5 million

462
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,006
That's a utility belt, not a money belt

463
00:45:25,215 --> 00:45:26,216
6 million

464
00:45:26,383 --> 00:45:27,300
7 million

465
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:32,305
Never leave the cave without it

466
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:36,017
You boys aren't going to start fighting
over little old me, now are you?

467
00:45:49,823 --> 00:45:52,033
All right, everyone!
Chill

468
00:45:53,368 --> 00:45:54,202
Chill

469
00:46:03,545 --> 00:46:04,462
Get the gun!

470
00:46:48,548 --> 00:46:50,175
Look at you!

471
00:46:50,383 --> 00:46:52,260
Let me guess

472
00:46:52,886 --> 00:46:54,095
Plant Girl?

473
00:46:54,512 --> 00:46:56,306
Vine Lady?

474
00:46:57,057 --> 00:46:59,267
Hand over the diamond, Garden Gal

475
00:46:59,476 --> 00:47:01,269
or I'll turn you into mulch

476
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:07,776
Pheromone dust

477
00:47:08,777 --> 00:47:10,028
designed to heat

478
00:47:10,236 --> 00:47:11,613
a man's blood

479
00:47:12,072 --> 00:47:14,449
Doesn't work on the cold-hearted
If you please!

480
00:47:15,492 --> 00:47:17,535
If you insist

481
00:47:21,081 --> 00:47:23,541
Clever little clover

482
00:47:27,629 --> 00:47:29,756
That's my exit cue

483
00:47:30,256 --> 00:47:31,466
Thanks

484
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:44,020
Good night

485
00:47:46,189 --> 00:47:47,816
Cool party!

486
00:48:15,343 --> 00:48:18,513
Commissioner, you have 11 minutes
to thaw these people

487
00:48:25,061 --> 00:48:28,940
Miss Ivy, you've just met
one of the most sinister men in Gotham

488
00:48:29,399 --> 00:48:31,359
That's not a man

489
00:48:31,568 --> 00:48:33,528
that is a god

490
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:41,578
Enough monkey business

491
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,706
We've got work to do

492
00:48:45,582 --> 00:48:47,125
Monkey work

493
00:49:37,926 --> 00:49:39,302
You can't make the jump

494
00:49:39,511 --> 00:49:40,595
I can!

495
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:44,140
Pull back!

496
00:49:44,599 --> 00:49:45,600
I can make it!

497
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,394
Redbird control codes

498
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:51,690
Disable engine

499
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:54,818
Don't do it to me! !

500
00:50:03,159 --> 00:50:04,369
We won't make it!

501
00:50:27,475 --> 00:50:29,602
It's a cold town

502
00:51:01,009 --> 00:51:02,469
I could've made that jump

503
00:51:02,802 --> 00:51:05,555
You could've splattered your brains
on the building's side

504
00:51:05,764 --> 00:51:07,474
The Flying Graysons were a team

505
00:51:07,724 --> 00:51:09,601
We had to trust each to do his job

506
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,853
That's what being partners is about

507
00:51:12,062 --> 00:51:14,439
Counting on someone is the way to win

508
00:51:14,689 --> 00:51:16,983
Your head wasn't on the job
It was on Poison Ivy

509
00:51:17,567 --> 00:51:19,694
Maybe she wanted me instead of you

510
00:51:19,944 --> 00:51:21,654
That's your idea of friendship?

511
00:51:21,863 --> 00:51:24,532
It's your rules
It's your way, or the highway

512
00:51:24,741 --> 00:51:27,369
It's Batman and Robin,
not Robin and Batman

513
00:51:27,577 --> 00:51:30,747
-I'm sick of it!
-Yes, it's my rules that keep us alive

514
00:51:30,914 --> 00:51:34,250
If you want to stay in this house,
on this team, you'll abide by them

515
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,003
This is no partnership

516
00:51:37,253 --> 00:51:38,713
You're never going to trust me!

517
00:51:45,595 --> 00:51:47,305
Dear brother Wilfred

518
00:51:47,889 --> 00:51:51,726
I have tried
every address I know for you

519
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,396
I'm just praying this reaches you

520
00:51:55,271 --> 00:51:56,731
We have very little time

521
00:52:13,331 --> 00:52:15,792
Batman monopolized the evening news

522
00:52:18,086 --> 00:52:20,672
Congratulations on your
apprehension of Mr Freeze

523
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,424
Thanks
Thank you

524
00:52:25,969 --> 00:52:27,595
Is there something wrong, sir?

525
00:52:30,807 --> 00:52:32,434
Am I pig-headed?

526
00:52:35,103 --> 00:52:36,646
Is it always

527
00:52:36,813 --> 00:52:38,773
my way or the highway?

528
00:52:39,274 --> 00:52:40,900
Why, yes
Actually

529
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:45,864
Death and chance stole your parents

530
00:52:46,114 --> 00:52:48,158
but rather than become a victim

531
00:52:48,408 --> 00:52:52,287
you have done everything
in your power to control the fates

532
00:52:52,954 --> 00:52:54,914
For what is Batman

533
00:52:55,248 --> 00:52:59,878
if not an effort to master the chaos
that sweeps our world?

534
00:53:00,837 --> 00:53:02,714
An attempt to control

535
00:53:02,881 --> 00:53:04,591
death itself?

536
00:53:24,444 --> 00:53:25,987
But I can't, can I?

537
00:53:27,781 --> 00:53:29,407
None of us can

538
00:53:55,475 --> 00:53:57,769
Sorry So sorry!

539
00:53:58,019 --> 00:53:59,396
Teach you that at Oxbridge?

540
00:53:59,646 --> 00:54:03,942
Just a few judo lessons
You know, London's kind of rough

541
00:54:04,317 --> 00:54:06,695
I suppose you had
a minor in motorbikes also?

542
00:54:09,114 --> 00:54:10,740
Couldn't resist

543
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:12,325
It's just so beautiful

544
00:54:13,326 --> 00:54:16,079
I just took it out for a spin
I'll clean it tomorrow

545
00:54:16,496 --> 00:54:17,414
All right?

546
00:54:17,664 --> 00:54:18,832
Sorry

547
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:21,376
Sorry
Good night

548
00:55:06,796 --> 00:55:08,923
Drag him into the cold beam

549
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:12,761
Welcome home, Frost Face

550
00:55:12,969 --> 00:55:15,972
You're the common cold,
and we are the cure

551
00:55:18,266 --> 00:55:20,810
Allow me to break the ice

552
00:55:21,102 --> 00:55:23,229
My name is Freeze

553
00:55:23,563 --> 00:55:25,273
Learn it well

554
00:55:25,565 --> 00:55:28,401
for it's the chilling sound
of your doom

555
00:55:40,288 --> 00:55:44,751
All right, Freezie, you can't live
outside the cold zone

556
00:55:56,054 --> 00:55:58,014
Look at him stew

557
00:56:00,141 --> 00:56:01,518
Get used to it

558
00:56:01,768 --> 00:56:04,604
You're going to be here a very long

559
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:06,564
long time

560
00:56:08,024 --> 00:56:09,567
Sadly

561
00:56:09,776 --> 00:56:12,153
you will not live to see it

562
00:56:24,053 --> 00:56:27,640
Batface and Birdbrain turned out
to be much more resistant

563
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:30,143
to my love dust
than expected

564
00:56:30,393 --> 00:56:34,355
No matter Next time
I'll just give them a stronger dose

565
00:56:34,647 --> 00:56:37,650
They'll literally be dying for me

566
00:56:38,693 --> 00:56:40,820
"Turkish baths"

567
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,947
This looks promising

568
00:57:10,266 --> 00:57:12,143
A fixer-upper

569
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:14,854
But with a certain homey charm

570
00:57:16,606 --> 00:57:17,857
A minus!

571
00:57:18,191 --> 00:57:19,901
Current tenants

572
00:57:20,109 --> 00:57:23,029
Hello, my little pretty, pretty, pretty

573
00:57:23,237 --> 00:57:25,031
Hello, yourself

574
00:57:25,657 --> 00:57:27,200
You look good enough to eat

575
00:57:27,909 --> 00:57:29,702
That I am

576
00:57:30,245 --> 00:57:33,081
Come and get me,
if you can

577
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:37,543
With pleasure

578
00:57:57,981 --> 00:57:59,524
Let's redecorate

579
00:58:08,417 --> 00:58:11,670
I've always hankered
for something on the water

580
00:58:20,095 --> 00:58:22,097
What is this floor?

581
00:58:29,355 --> 00:58:31,440
It took God seven days

582
00:58:31,690 --> 00:58:33,776
to create Paradise

583
00:58:34,276 --> 00:58:36,987
Let's see if I can do better

584
00:58:43,452 --> 00:58:45,454
Good babies

585
00:58:45,955 --> 00:58:46,997
Grow for mommy

586
00:58:53,045 --> 00:58:54,505
Bane, darling

587
00:58:54,713 --> 00:58:58,050
I found a fellow
who strikes my fancy

588
00:58:58,384 --> 00:59:00,469
A cool customer, yes

589
00:59:01,595 --> 00:59:03,472
Icy demeanor

590
00:59:04,098 --> 00:59:05,558
no question

591
00:59:06,392 --> 00:59:10,145
But I detect a certain ruthless charm
I may be able to use

592
00:59:10,354 --> 00:59:12,231
to my advantage

593
00:59:13,148 --> 00:59:15,651
Honey, clean up this mess

594
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:17,862
We've got company coming

595
00:59:18,696 --> 00:59:19,613
Honey

596
00:59:20,364 --> 00:59:21,490
Company

597
00:59:34,962 --> 00:59:38,299
We've been going out
for over a year now, and

598
00:59:39,758 --> 00:59:41,010
Okay, here it goes

599
00:59:41,218 --> 00:59:43,512
I want to spend my life with you

600
00:59:46,765 --> 00:59:48,517
I'm not the marrying kind

601
00:59:48,726 --> 00:59:51,645
There are things about me
you wouldn't understand

602
00:59:52,188 --> 00:59:54,982
I know you're a dedicated bachelor

603
00:59:55,191 --> 00:59:56,650
You've had your wild nights

604
00:59:57,276 --> 00:59:58,736
"Wild" doesn't

605
00:59:59,695 --> 01:00:01,113
quite cover it

606
01:00:02,698 --> 01:00:05,201
You'll make someone
a good husband one day

607
01:00:05,618 --> 01:00:06,952
but I can't wait forever

608
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:14,877
Look, I don't want to pressure you
Because if I do

609
01:00:15,127 --> 01:00:17,087
you'll just shut down

610
01:00:17,630 --> 01:00:19,173
I know the way you are

611
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:22,510
Think about it

612
01:00:22,718 --> 01:00:24,887
Just promise me you'll think about it

613
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:26,680
Okay?

614
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:29,934
You don't have to answer now

615
01:00:30,309 --> 01:00:31,477
Just

616
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:32,937
think it over

617
01:00:33,145 --> 01:00:34,897
Here's food for thought

618
01:00:53,916 --> 01:00:55,042
Who's Ivy?

619
01:00:57,419 --> 01:00:59,213
You just called me "Ivy"

620
01:00:59,421 --> 01:01:00,756
Who's Ivy?

621
01:01:02,007 --> 01:01:03,384
I wish I knew

622
01:01:05,594 --> 01:01:07,972
Enhance detail, 14 to 19

623
01:01:13,185 --> 01:01:14,854
Who are you?

624
01:01:28,826 --> 01:01:29,952
Gotcha!

625
01:02:18,042 --> 01:02:19,710
Banker, how much coin to play?

626
01:02:19,919 --> 01:02:20,961
21/2

627
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,089
You're the chick who won
the tunnel run 2 nights ago!

628
01:02:24,298 --> 01:02:25,341
That'd be me

629
01:02:25,549 --> 01:02:27,843
That was kid stuff, sweetheart

630
01:02:28,177 --> 01:02:30,971
Why don't you take your tricycle
and run home?

631
01:02:32,014 --> 01:02:33,766
-Want a side bet?
-How much?

632
01:02:34,016 --> 01:02:35,768
-How much you got?
-How much you got?

633
01:02:35,851 --> 01:02:39,104
All right, let's race! Come on!

634
01:02:47,029 --> 01:02:50,366
Just make sure the guys are ready
at the end of the bridge

635
01:02:51,617 --> 01:02:52,868
You got it, Spike!

636
01:04:02,313 --> 01:04:04,190
Out of my way, losers!

637
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:06,692
Nice try, girlie!

638
01:04:06,901 --> 01:04:08,152
You're next!

639
01:04:10,237 --> 01:04:11,697
Excuse me!

640
01:04:15,242 --> 01:04:16,702
Look out, baby!

641
01:04:35,679 --> 01:04:37,973
Not bad, for a chick!

642
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:12,174
Now!

643
01:05:26,772 --> 01:05:28,232
End of the line, sweetheart!

644
01:05:54,717 --> 01:05:56,302
So this is where you hang out

645
01:06:00,973 --> 01:06:02,141
How long you been racing?

646
01:06:02,308 --> 01:06:04,393
Since my parents died

647
01:06:04,518 --> 01:06:08,564
I guess all the speed and danger
helped take me out of myself

648
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:10,482
Made the pain go away

649
01:06:11,066 --> 01:06:12,735
You wouldn't understand

650
01:06:12,985 --> 01:06:14,403
You'd be surprised

651
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:19,408
Street racing isn't exactly
an acceptable major at Oxbridge so

652
01:06:19,533 --> 01:06:20,993
they kicked me out

653
01:06:21,327 --> 01:06:24,955
But I've already won the money I need
to do what I've always dreamed

654
01:06:25,164 --> 01:06:27,249
Don't say you want to join the circus

655
01:06:28,292 --> 01:06:32,338
Alfred has supported me my whole life
and I'm going to pay him back

656
01:06:33,297 --> 01:06:35,925
I'll take him away
from this dismal life of servitude

657
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,177
What are you talking about?

658
01:06:38,427 --> 01:06:41,222
Listen, this whole
master-servant thing

659
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,765
it's really ridiculous

660
01:06:43,015 --> 01:06:45,184
Alfred is a sweet, noble man

661
01:06:45,392 --> 01:06:48,938
and he's subjugated all his life
and dreams to someone else

662
01:06:49,146 --> 01:06:51,106
Alfred and Bruce are like family

663
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,360
Paying someone to prepare your meals

664
01:06:54,568 --> 01:06:57,488
do laundry, clean dishes,
you call that family?

665
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,156
Alfred's happy

666
01:06:59,448 --> 01:07:00,824
Happy?

667
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,869
You honestly don't know, do you?

668
01:07:04,036 --> 01:07:06,539
How he's hiding the pain all the time

669
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:08,624
Alfred's sick

670
01:07:12,294 --> 01:07:14,171
Alfred's not sick

671
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:15,840
He's dying

672
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:19,677
Dying?

673
01:07:23,138 --> 01:07:24,598
Why didn't he tell us?

674
01:07:25,224 --> 01:07:27,935
You know Alfred,
he'd never say anything

675
01:07:34,191 --> 01:07:35,442
But I can tell

676
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:42,241
I can't believe it

677
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:44,618
I know

678
01:08:33,417 --> 01:08:35,085
Icehead, you got a visitor

679
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,005
Your sister is here to see you

680
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:39,465
Sister?

681
01:08:43,636 --> 01:08:45,513
Brother, dear

682
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:48,432
I heard you were blue

683
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:53,145
Don't mind us, ma'am

684
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:55,231
You can speak freely

685
01:08:57,900 --> 01:09:00,402
I don't mind you at all

686
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:05,658
Men

687
01:09:05,950 --> 01:09:08,744
the most absurd of God's creatures

688
01:09:08,994 --> 01:09:10,204
We give you life

689
01:09:10,955 --> 01:09:14,375
and we can take it away
just as easily

690
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,794
-Right!
-Whatever

691
01:09:18,170 --> 01:09:20,631
I really am to die for

692
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:50,160
Impressive!

693
01:09:51,287 --> 01:09:54,540
Well, I, my most
unabominable snowman

694
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:57,543
have been impressed by you

695
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,128
In fact

696
01:09:59,336 --> 01:10:01,839
I propose a pairing

697
01:10:11,974 --> 01:10:13,934
I've come to set you free

698
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,729
An enticing offer

699
01:10:17,479 --> 01:10:18,522
but

700
01:10:18,647 --> 01:10:20,816
what does the lady want in return?

701
01:10:23,652 --> 01:10:27,072
Let's cool it for now
I've got someone I want you to meet

702
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:36,749
His name is Bane

703
01:10:37,416 --> 01:10:40,419
A laundry service that delivers! Wow!

704
01:10:45,508 --> 01:10:48,344
What are you,
about a 50, big and tall?

705
01:10:48,761 --> 01:10:52,598
No, I always go a size smaller
Makes me look slimmer

706
01:10:58,270 --> 01:10:59,688
I'm running on empty

707
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:01,482
I need the diamonds

708
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:03,776
I'll help you grab your rocks

709
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:08,364
Bane

710
01:11:08,572 --> 01:11:09,823
dear

711
01:11:10,032 --> 01:11:11,617
an exit, please

712
01:11:17,456 --> 01:11:19,124
Reinforced steel

713
01:11:19,416 --> 01:11:20,459
Not good

714
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:33,722
Always winterize your pipes

715
01:11:49,864 --> 01:11:53,826
While I get my diamonds,
you and "meatloaf" retrieve my wife

716
01:11:54,034 --> 01:11:56,120
You never mentioned a wife!

717
01:11:56,328 --> 01:11:57,246
Come on

718
01:11:57,496 --> 01:11:59,331
I hope Mr Bane can swim

719
01:12:17,808 --> 01:12:19,768
Alfred, are you well?

720
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:22,605
As well as can be expected, sir

721
01:12:24,773 --> 01:12:26,358
My friend, I know you're sick

722
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:28,360
I can get you the best doctors

723
01:12:28,527 --> 01:12:31,155
I have seen the best doctors

724
01:12:31,697 --> 01:12:36,285
A gentleman does not discuss
his ailments It is not civilized

725
01:12:36,785 --> 01:12:40,956
I hope that I have taught you
at least that much, Master Bruce

726
01:12:44,376 --> 01:12:45,753
Have you ever

727
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,464
regretted your life working here?

728
01:12:49,298 --> 01:12:50,758
Looking after heroes?

729
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:52,218
No, sir

730
01:12:53,260 --> 01:12:57,306
My only regret is that I was never
able to be out there with you

731
01:13:00,893 --> 01:13:03,270
Not all the heroes wear masks

732
01:13:07,441 --> 01:13:08,692
Freeze has escaped!

733
01:13:22,581 --> 01:13:25,084
We got this off
the Arkham surveillance camera

734
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:29,672
Poison Ivy

735
01:13:31,423 --> 01:13:32,341
2 nights ago

736
01:13:32,675 --> 01:13:36,637
Gotham Airport, these two arrive
by charter from South America

737
01:13:37,054 --> 01:13:39,974
They put 10 security guards
in the hospital

738
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:44,687
left a businessman dead from
organic poisoning, stole his limousine

739
01:13:44,979 --> 01:13:48,190
This is definitely the same pair
that sprang Freeze

740
01:13:49,441 --> 01:13:50,818
Excuse me, gentlemen

741
01:13:51,777 --> 01:13:54,280
Poison Ivy
why would she help Freeze?

742
01:13:54,446 --> 01:13:56,031
She's definitely evil

743
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:58,951
She was all I could think about,
like I was in love--

744
01:13:59,285 --> 01:14:01,370
I know, then the feeling vanished

745
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:03,873
I can't believe
we fought over a bad guy

746
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,375
Bad, yes Guy, no

747
01:14:06,667 --> 01:14:08,335
Well, I'm totally over her

748
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:10,296
Me too Definitely

749
01:14:11,255 --> 01:14:13,340
-Great stems, though
-Buds too

750
01:14:13,549 --> 01:14:14,592
Those are nice

751
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:15,843
Here we go

752
01:14:22,099 --> 01:14:23,225
It's Nora Fries

753
01:14:23,475 --> 01:14:24,727
She's still alive

754
01:14:40,743 --> 01:14:43,579
He adapted his freezing technology
to reverse the disease

755
01:14:43,787 --> 01:14:46,499
He found a cure for the disease
in some stages

756
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:48,501
There she is

757
01:14:49,752 --> 01:14:52,004
Get the diamonds
I'll rescue the bride

758
01:14:52,338 --> 01:14:54,423
We'll meet back at my place

759
01:14:55,257 --> 01:14:58,594
In my weakened condition,
I'm no match for the Bat and Bird

760
01:14:58,802 --> 01:15:01,305
You leave those boys to me

761
01:15:01,847 --> 01:15:02,765
Go!

762
01:15:05,351 --> 01:15:07,978
-Can he save her?
-Her case is too advanced

763
01:15:08,270 --> 01:15:09,647
But maybe someday

764
01:15:09,855 --> 01:15:11,440
with more research

765
01:15:17,988 --> 01:15:19,365
Poison Ivy

766
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,544
I hate uninvited guests

767
01:15:38,843 --> 01:15:40,302
My lungs are freezing!

768
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:54,275
Chilled

769
01:15:54,483 --> 01:15:55,734
to perfection

770
01:16:02,908 --> 01:16:03,868
No beauty

771
01:16:06,871 --> 01:16:08,455
Just the beast

772
01:16:28,392 --> 01:16:30,477
Hey, there, pretty birdie

773
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,563
Give yourself up If you surrender--

774
01:16:32,771 --> 01:16:33,898
To you?

775
01:16:35,858 --> 01:16:37,860
Polly want a kiss?

776
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:54,627
There's something about
an anatomically correct

777
01:16:54,835 --> 01:16:58,923
rubber suit
that puts fire in a girl's lips

778
01:17:02,259 --> 01:17:05,804
Why are all the gorgeous ones
homicidal maniacs? Is it me?

779
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:06,847
Enough

780
01:17:07,056 --> 01:17:08,724
sweet talk

781
01:17:11,644 --> 01:17:14,980
First you'll tell me where Freeze is,
then you're going to jail

782
01:17:19,235 --> 01:17:20,736
I'm a lover, not a fighter

783
01:17:20,903 --> 01:17:24,240
That's why every Poison Ivy
Action Figure comes with him!

784
01:17:27,827 --> 01:17:30,621
Try not to make a mess when you die

785
01:18:01,694 --> 01:18:02,862
Hold it right there!

786
01:18:24,508 --> 01:18:25,801
Stop!

787
01:18:28,179 --> 01:18:31,807
Living in the shadow
of the big, bad Bat

788
01:18:32,057 --> 01:18:33,893
You don't need him

789
01:18:34,643 --> 01:18:36,812
You're the star

790
01:18:37,021 --> 01:18:38,814
I can see it now:

791
01:18:39,023 --> 01:18:43,194
Your own big, bright signal in the sky

792
01:18:44,028 --> 01:18:46,030
Let me guide you

793
01:18:54,663 --> 01:18:56,540
Let me kiss you

794
01:18:56,749 --> 01:18:58,209
Stop! Don't kiss her

795
01:18:58,834 --> 01:19:01,754
The victim at the airport,
toxins introduced orally

796
01:19:01,962 --> 01:19:04,465
-What are you saying?
-Why does she want to kiss us?

797
01:19:04,798 --> 01:19:07,176
-I bet her lips are poisoned
-Poisoned kiss?

798
01:19:07,384 --> 01:19:08,761
You have issues with women!

799
01:19:08,969 --> 01:19:11,347
You can't stand that
she'd kiss me and not you

800
01:19:11,555 --> 01:19:13,766
Something would be mine, not yours

801
01:19:24,193 --> 01:19:25,319
Exit, Bane

802
01:19:25,736 --> 01:19:27,196
Exit!

803
01:19:38,249 --> 01:19:40,751
Ivy's right I don't need your help

804
01:19:43,045 --> 01:19:44,713
I'm going solo!

805
01:19:47,424 --> 01:19:48,467
What happened?

806
01:19:48,676 --> 01:19:50,344
How'd they get away?

807
01:20:07,862 --> 01:20:10,781
I've never been good with competition

808
01:20:12,867 --> 01:20:15,911
Who needs a frigid wife anyway?

809
01:20:41,020 --> 01:20:42,897
Make yourself right at home

810
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:46,442
Where's my wife?

811
01:20:46,984 --> 01:20:49,987
There was nothing I could do
Batman deactivated her

812
01:20:50,404 --> 01:20:52,698
-She's dead
-You lie!

813
01:21:17,515 --> 01:21:18,974
I'm sorry

814
01:21:21,268 --> 01:21:24,188
Their bones will turn to ice!

815
01:21:26,398 --> 01:21:29,068
Their blood will freeze in my hands!

816
01:21:29,902 --> 01:21:31,278
Kill them, of course

817
01:21:31,487 --> 01:21:33,364
But why stop there?

818
01:21:33,989 --> 01:21:36,826
Why should only
Batman and Robin die

819
01:21:36,992 --> 01:21:40,329
while the society that created them
goes unpunished?

820
01:21:40,663 --> 01:21:42,331
Yes!

821
01:21:42,540 --> 01:21:44,625
If I must suffer

822
01:21:44,917 --> 01:21:47,837
humanity will suffer with me!

823
01:21:48,087 --> 01:21:52,967
I shall repay them for sentencing me
to a life without human comfort

824
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:56,929
I will blanket the city
in endless winter!

825
01:21:57,263 --> 01:21:58,389
First

826
01:21:59,849 --> 01:22:01,100
Gotham

827
01:22:02,268 --> 01:22:03,811
And then

828
01:22:04,228 --> 01:22:05,271
the world!

829
01:22:05,771 --> 01:22:08,524
Just what I had in mind

830
01:22:09,859 --> 01:22:12,987
Everything dead on Earth except us

831
01:22:13,195 --> 01:22:14,655
A chance for

832
01:22:14,947 --> 01:22:17,783
Mother Nature to start again

833
01:22:18,117 --> 01:22:19,034
Behold

834
01:22:19,243 --> 01:22:21,954
the dawn of a new age

835
01:22:25,374 --> 01:22:28,627
My mutant plants have the strength
of the deadliest animals

836
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:33,841
Once you have frozen mankind,
these babies will overrun the globe

837
01:22:34,800 --> 01:22:36,552
And we shall rule them

838
01:22:38,220 --> 01:22:39,680
For we will be

839
01:22:39,972 --> 01:22:42,474
the only two people
left in the world

840
01:22:43,434 --> 01:22:45,102
Yes

841
01:22:45,394 --> 01:22:46,770
Adam

842
01:22:48,230 --> 01:22:49,481
and Evil

843
01:22:51,233 --> 01:22:53,235
You distract the Bat and Bird

844
01:22:53,444 --> 01:22:54,904
while I prepare

845
01:22:55,112 --> 01:22:56,488
to freeze

846
01:22:56,780 --> 01:22:58,157
Gotham!

847
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:15,758
It's Stage 1 of Macgregor's Syndrome

848
01:23:16,258 --> 01:23:17,426
I'm sorry

849
01:23:18,594 --> 01:23:21,388
All we can do is
make him comfortable

850
01:23:23,891 --> 01:23:25,267
Thank you, Doctor

851
01:23:42,535 --> 01:23:45,162
Macgregor's Syndrome is
what Fries' wife had

852
01:23:45,704 --> 01:23:48,290
Alfred's condition is less severe
Fries' research said

853
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:51,001
he cured a case like it,
just didn't say how

854
01:23:51,210 --> 01:23:53,087
No one else is even close

855
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:56,841
I'm late for the dedication,
then I go after Freeze and Ivy alone

856
01:23:57,132 --> 01:23:59,343
-Like hell you do
-Don't push me right now

857
01:23:59,552 --> 01:24:02,888
Or what? No one can
capture Ivy but the big, bad Bat?

858
01:24:03,097 --> 01:24:03,806
Right

859
01:24:04,348 --> 01:24:05,808
You want her for yourself

860
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:09,645
I want her so badly, I can taste it
That's the whole point

861
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:14,900
She's done something to us
She has us fighting over her somehow

862
01:24:15,192 --> 01:24:18,529
I know she loves me and not you,
and it's driving you crazy

863
01:24:18,821 --> 01:24:21,240
That's why you
stopped us from kissing

864
01:24:21,323 --> 01:24:24,076
-You're not thinking straight
-But I am

865
01:24:25,202 --> 01:24:27,079
For the first time in a long time

866
01:24:27,288 --> 01:24:29,790
I want a Robin signal
in the sky, all right?

867
01:24:29,999 --> 01:24:32,001
I'm tired of living
in your shadow

868
01:24:32,168 --> 01:24:33,335
All that ends now

869
01:24:38,424 --> 01:24:40,217
I'm sorry, Uncle

870
01:24:41,594 --> 01:24:43,262
I was too late

871
01:24:54,106 --> 01:24:56,775
You must do something for me

872
01:24:58,986 --> 01:25:00,863
Find my brother, Wilfred

873
01:25:01,071 --> 01:25:03,574
your uncle,
wherever he is, and give him

874
01:25:03,866 --> 01:25:04,825
this

875
01:25:05,117 --> 01:25:08,871
I have duties
that he must fulfill in my stead

876
01:25:10,247 --> 01:25:12,750
Only family can be trusted

877
01:25:13,709 --> 01:25:14,835
What is it?

878
01:25:15,461 --> 01:25:18,797
It is a sacred trust of two good men

879
01:25:19,006 --> 01:25:22,134
whom I have the honor
of calling "son"

880
01:25:25,054 --> 01:25:26,305
Take it to Wilfred

881
01:25:26,514 --> 01:25:28,182
and I implore you

882
01:25:29,016 --> 01:25:30,476
never open it

883
01:25:33,896 --> 01:25:36,941
You look so like your mother

884
01:25:40,486 --> 01:25:43,322
Bonsoir, glamorous Gothamites

885
01:25:43,489 --> 01:25:45,407
Everyone who 's anyone

886
01:25:45,574 --> 01:25:47,368
has flocked to the observatory

887
01:25:47,576 --> 01:25:51,664
and tonight's star-studded
dedication of the new telescope

888
01:25:56,544 --> 01:26:00,005
And here's the man
of the hour himself

889
01:26:00,297 --> 01:26:02,174
Bruce Wayne

890
01:26:05,427 --> 01:26:06,554
Excuse me

891
01:26:09,473 --> 01:26:10,516
Commissioner

892
01:26:10,599 --> 01:26:12,101
-How are you?
-Good You know Julie?

893
01:26:12,393 --> 01:26:13,644
How are you?

894
01:26:13,853 --> 01:26:15,104
Good to see you

895
01:26:17,523 --> 01:26:18,649
Young man

896
01:26:20,442 --> 01:26:22,111
Lovely to see you again

897
01:26:27,408 --> 01:26:28,534
Thank you

898
01:26:29,201 --> 01:26:30,870
Commissioner Gordon

899
01:26:33,372 --> 01:26:35,124
I've always wondered

900
01:26:35,332 --> 01:26:39,086
where does that big,
old Batlight come from?

901
01:26:44,925 --> 01:26:46,385
Why

902
01:26:46,468 --> 01:26:47,303
it's

903
01:26:47,553 --> 01:26:49,638
on top of Police Headquarters

904
01:26:50,556 --> 01:26:51,807
I'd just

905
01:26:52,016 --> 01:26:53,559
love to see it

906
01:26:53,893 --> 01:26:56,312
But you probably don't have access

907
01:26:56,478 --> 01:26:57,730
Why, dear lady

908
01:26:58,898 --> 01:27:01,192
I am the police commissioner

909
01:27:01,483 --> 01:27:04,403
I have the keys
right here in my pocket

910
01:27:04,653 --> 01:27:06,197
Would you like to see it?

911
01:27:24,757 --> 01:27:27,676
Who are you, dear lady?

912
01:27:30,596 --> 01:27:33,516
On second thought,
you're way too old for me

913
01:27:33,599 --> 01:27:35,392
No, I'm not

914
01:27:36,519 --> 01:27:38,020
Please

915
01:27:38,187 --> 01:27:39,772
come back

916
01:27:46,529 --> 01:27:48,531
What are you doing? Come on

917
01:27:49,365 --> 01:27:51,784
Show me how the satellites work

918
01:28:05,214 --> 01:28:06,257
First

919
01:28:06,465 --> 01:28:09,593
I will turn Gotham into
an icy graveyard

920
01:28:09,802 --> 01:28:10,636
then

921
01:28:10,845 --> 01:28:13,764
I will pull Batman's heart
from his body

922
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:16,684
and feel it freeze in my hands

923
01:28:21,272 --> 01:28:22,106
Revenge!

924
01:28:23,566 --> 01:28:25,150
Quickly, Bane

925
01:28:25,442 --> 01:28:26,569
Quickly now

926
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:42,126
Let there be light

927
01:28:48,507 --> 01:28:50,885
Only family can be trusted?

928
01:28:53,804 --> 01:28:54,930
I'm family

931
01:29:31,634 --> 01:29:34,803
I spend my entire life
trying to beat back death

932
01:29:39,058 --> 01:29:41,477
Everything I've done,
everything I'm

933
01:29:42,186 --> 01:29:44,146
capable of doing

934
01:29:47,608 --> 01:29:49,568
But I can't save you

935
01:29:50,736 --> 01:29:53,739
There's no defeat in death

936
01:29:54,073 --> 01:29:55,950
Master Bruce

937
01:29:57,493 --> 01:30:00,412
Victory comes in defending

938
01:30:00,663 --> 01:30:02,832
what we know is right

939
01:30:03,332 --> 01:30:05,751
while we still live

940
01:30:35,030 --> 01:30:36,615
I love you, old man

941
01:30:40,161 --> 01:30:42,872
And I love you too

Access allo wed

947
01:32:13,379 --> 01:32:16,507
The combined power of
the telescope's reflecting crystals

948
01:32:16,715 --> 01:32:17,758
will complete

949
01:32:17,967 --> 01:32:19,635
my freezing engine

950
01:32:23,389 --> 01:32:26,100
No matter
what they tell you, Mr Bane

951
01:32:26,392 --> 01:32:29,019
it is the size of
your gun that counts

952
01:32:38,737 --> 01:32:39,738
Where are you going?

953
01:32:39,989 --> 01:32:42,908
It's not a Batlight, it's a Robin signal
Ivy's calling me

954
01:32:43,075 --> 01:32:44,243
Her name's Pamela Isley

955
01:32:44,451 --> 01:32:47,246
She must've stolen Gordon's keys
and changed the signal

956
01:32:47,496 --> 01:32:48,831
She did it for me, for love

957
01:32:49,039 --> 01:32:50,916
She infected us with pheromones

958
01:32:51,125 --> 01:32:53,419
I'm under some kind of magic spell?

959
01:32:53,627 --> 01:32:54,879
She wants to kill you

960
01:32:55,087 --> 01:32:57,673
You'd say anything to keep her
away from me

961
01:32:57,923 --> 01:32:59,466
To keep her for yourself

962
01:33:00,009 --> 01:33:02,595
You said being a team
means trusting your partner

963
01:33:02,803 --> 01:33:07,266
Sometimes, counting on someone
else is the only way to win Remember?

964
01:33:07,933 --> 01:33:11,687
You weren't talking about partners,
but about being a family

965
01:33:12,396 --> 01:33:13,856
So I'm asking you

966
01:33:13,939 --> 01:33:15,608
friend, partner

967
01:33:15,941 --> 01:33:16,859
brother

968
01:33:17,943 --> 01:33:19,778
will you trust me now?

969
01:33:32,208 --> 01:33:34,919
-All the crystals are in place
-Thank you

970
01:33:44,386 --> 01:33:45,679
Hi!

971
01:33:45,888 --> 01:33:47,640
I'm sorry about the door

972
01:33:48,557 --> 01:33:49,850
Is the party over?

973
01:33:52,978 --> 01:33:54,813
Who is this nutball?

974
01:34:34,353 --> 01:34:36,021
If revenge

975
01:34:36,230 --> 01:34:38,607
is a dish best served cold

976
01:34:39,024 --> 01:34:41,652
then put on your Sunday finest

977
01:34:42,194 --> 01:34:43,195
It's time

978
01:34:43,612 --> 01:34:45,197
to feast!

979
01:34:56,792 --> 01:34:57,918
Tonight

980
01:34:58,210 --> 01:35:01,046
hell freezes over

981
01:35:40,586 --> 01:35:42,004

Uncle Alfred, it's me Barbara

985
01:35:51,597 --> 01:35:54,517
l expected you might find
your way down here, child

986
01:35:54,850 --> 01:35:57,144
l programmed my brain algorithms

987
01:35:57,353 --> 01:35:58,812
into the Batcomputer

988
01:35:59,021 --> 01:36:02,566
and created a virtual simulation

989
01:36:02,858 --> 01:36:05,069
I'd like to help Batman and Robin

990
01:36:05,152 --> 01:36:06,862
l anticipated you would

991
01:36:07,029 --> 01:36:10,366
and took the liberty
to create something in your size

992
01:36:11,742 --> 01:36:13,828
Suit me up, Uncle Alfred

993
01:37:34,742 --> 01:37:35,993
Hi there

994
01:37:40,164 --> 01:37:42,875
Is your thumb the
only part of you that's green?

995
01:37:43,292 --> 01:37:46,128
You will just have to find out

996
01:37:46,837 --> 01:37:48,714
I want us to be together, but

997
01:37:48,797 --> 01:37:51,425
you must be serious
about turning over a new leaf

998
01:37:53,302 --> 01:37:54,136
I need a sign

999
01:37:55,179 --> 01:37:57,264
How about "Slippery when wet"

1000
01:37:57,473 --> 01:37:58,641
of trust

1001
01:37:59,058 --> 01:38:00,601
Tell me your plan

1002
01:38:00,809 --> 01:38:02,269
Kiss me and I'll tell you

1003
01:38:03,312 --> 01:38:05,189
Tell me and I'll kiss you

1004
01:38:06,649 --> 01:38:11,320
Freeze has taken the new telescope
and turned it into a giant freezing gun

1005
01:38:11,737 --> 01:38:14,240
He's about to turn Gotham
into an ice cube

1006
01:38:15,616 --> 01:38:17,076
I've got to stop him

1007
01:38:17,284 --> 01:38:18,410
One kiss

1008
01:38:18,619 --> 01:38:19,662
my love

1009
01:38:20,830 --> 01:38:22,289
For luck

1010
01:38:35,302 --> 01:38:37,096
Bad luck, I'm afraid

1011
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,932
Time to die, little Robin

1012
01:38:43,143 --> 01:38:45,437
I hate to disappoint you, but

1013
01:38:49,525 --> 01:38:52,236
rubber lips are immune to
your charms

1014
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:00,661
See you!

1015
01:39:02,746 --> 01:39:05,457
You're not the only one
who can set a trap, Venus

1016
01:39:05,875 --> 01:39:06,834
Sorry

1017
01:39:07,042 --> 01:39:09,628
my vines have a crush on you

1018
01:39:17,553 --> 01:39:18,721
Got to go

1019
01:39:18,888 --> 01:39:22,349
So many people to kill,
so little time

1020
01:39:31,942 --> 01:39:33,486
You're about to become compost

1021
01:39:41,327 --> 01:39:43,913
Using feminine wiles
to get what you want?

1022
01:39:44,121 --> 01:39:45,080
Trading on your looks?

1023
01:39:45,289 --> 01:39:46,207
Read a book

1024
01:39:46,457 --> 01:39:48,834
That passive-aggressive
number went out long ago

1025
01:39:49,043 --> 01:39:51,128
You give women a bad name

1026
01:40:11,357 --> 01:40:15,194
As I told Lady Fries,
when I pulled her plug

1027
01:40:15,861 --> 01:40:17,488
this is a one-woman show

1028
01:40:18,030 --> 01:40:19,281
I don't think so

1029
01:40:41,053 --> 01:40:42,012
Curses!

1030
01:40:58,404 --> 01:41:00,072
Freeze is going to ice the city

1031
01:41:00,239 --> 01:41:01,407
I know

1032
01:41:01,615 --> 01:41:02,575
And you are?

1033
01:41:02,867 --> 01:41:03,826
Batgirl

1034
01:41:04,118 --> 01:41:07,538
That's not PC What about
Batperson or Batwoman?

1035
01:41:07,997 --> 01:41:11,208
Bruce, it's me, Barbara
I found the Batcave

1036
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:13,002
We must change the locks

1037
01:41:13,169 --> 01:41:15,254
-She knows who we are
-We must kill her

1038
01:41:15,504 --> 01:41:17,756
Later We have work to do

1039
01:41:37,067 --> 01:41:40,112
Let's kick some ice

1040
01:43:08,117 --> 01:43:10,286
We have 11 minutes
to thaw the city

1041
01:43:37,813 --> 01:43:39,064
Gotcha!

1042
01:43:40,024 --> 01:43:41,066
Now!

1043
01:43:50,659 --> 01:43:51,994
Shield

1044
01:44:14,016 --> 01:44:15,142
I'll finish off the city

1045
01:44:15,351 --> 01:44:17,645
You kill the kids, but

1046
01:44:17,853 --> 01:44:20,147
leave me the Bat

1047
01:44:40,376 --> 01:44:41,627
No sign of the snowman

1048
01:44:42,461 --> 01:44:44,213
Maybe he melted

1049
01:44:44,463 --> 01:44:46,632
No, he's just hibernating

1050
01:45:04,483 --> 01:45:05,484
These heaters will thaw them

1051
01:45:13,659 --> 01:45:15,744
I hope you've got
10 million more of those toys

1052
01:45:16,162 --> 01:45:18,247
8 minutes
and they're ice cubes forever

1053
01:45:18,414 --> 01:45:20,082
Sunlight could reverse
the freezing process

1054
01:45:20,332 --> 01:45:21,750
Sunrise isn't for 5 hours

1055
01:45:21,876 --> 01:45:22,418
Here

1056
01:45:22,585 --> 01:45:23,961
It's morning in the Congo

1057
01:45:24,253 --> 01:45:25,212
We'll relay sunlight--

1058
01:45:25,421 --> 01:45:26,672
From below the equator--

1059
01:45:26,881 --> 01:45:29,592
It'll take the satellites
a minute to realign, but

1060
01:45:30,092 --> 01:45:30,759
Damn!

1061
01:45:30,926 --> 01:45:32,511
Damn?
Damn's not good

1062
01:45:32,720 --> 01:45:35,347
Those targeting mirrors are frozen

1063
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:37,099
I realign, you thaw the mirrors

1064
01:46:03,375 --> 01:46:04,835
Tonight's forecast:

1065
01:46:05,044 --> 01:46:06,921
A freeze is coming

1066
01:46:21,310 --> 01:46:22,770
Bye-bye

1067
01:46:35,699 --> 01:46:36,951
I got you!

1068
01:46:47,586 --> 01:46:49,672
No
I got you

1069
01:47:02,685 --> 01:47:04,478
It's one of those days!

1070
01:47:58,699 --> 01:48:00,242
Dirty fighter!

1071
01:48:15,591 --> 01:48:16,634
The tube!

1072
01:48:31,440 --> 01:48:32,358
Yay, Batman!

1073
01:48:45,955 --> 01:48:47,498
Hey, Freeze

1074
01:48:47,706 --> 01:48:48,749
The heat is on

1075
01:49:02,096 --> 01:49:03,889
You all right down there?

1076
01:49:05,558 --> 01:49:06,475
Here goes

1077
01:49:35,588 --> 01:49:36,714
Hang on

1078
01:49:52,563 --> 01:49:53,522
You're doing it!

1079
01:49:54,648 --> 01:49:56,525
You've lost, Freeze

1080
01:49:57,151 --> 01:49:58,110
I think not

1081
01:49:59,445 --> 01:50:01,113
Bombs away, Batman

1082
01:50:25,513 --> 01:50:27,890
Freeze in hell, Batman!

1083
01:50:55,960 --> 01:50:57,503
What should we do now?

1084
01:50:57,753 --> 01:50:58,587
Pray

1085
01:51:04,510 --> 01:51:05,970
Hang on!

1086
01:51:08,764 --> 01:51:10,683
Grab on to my belt!

1087
01:51:29,451 --> 01:51:30,995
Thank you, Batman!

1088
01:51:36,292 --> 01:51:37,251
Need a ride?

1089
01:51:48,512 --> 01:51:50,890
-Most of Gotham's still frozen
-It's midnight

1090
01:51:51,307 --> 01:51:53,934
Telescope's gone
There's no way to thaw the city

1091
01:51:54,143 --> 01:51:57,062
The satellites could do it,
but it'd take a computer genius

1092
01:51:57,271 --> 01:51:58,314
I'm on it

1093
01:51:59,064 --> 01:52:00,191
No, I'm on it

1094
01:52:06,238 --> 01:52:07,573
Have to do it upside down

1095
01:52:07,907 --> 01:52:10,409
Men!
Everything the hard way

1096
01:52:12,995 --> 01:52:14,997
You're pretty good at this, little girl

1097
01:52:16,665 --> 01:52:19,168
Watch and Iearn, little boy

1098
01:53:26,110 --> 01:53:28,070
They say it'll be a beautiful day

1099
01:53:36,412 --> 01:53:39,456
I'm taking you back
to Arkham Asylum

1100
01:53:40,708 --> 01:53:42,168
Go on

1101
01:53:43,002 --> 01:53:44,336
Kill me too

1102
01:53:44,587 --> 01:53:46,130
Just as you killed my wife

1103
01:53:46,338 --> 01:53:48,007
I didn't kill your wife

1104
01:53:53,095 --> 01:53:57,099
As l told Lady Fries
when l pulled her plug

1105
01:53:57,391 --> 01:53:59,768
this is a one-woman show

1106
01:54:05,524 --> 01:54:08,027
But she's not dead

1107
01:54:08,110 --> 01:54:10,112
We found her,
restored her

1108
01:54:10,613 --> 01:54:12,823
She's still frozen alive

1109
01:54:13,115 --> 01:54:14,909
waiting for you to find a cure

1110
01:54:16,160 --> 01:54:17,828
She lives?

1111
01:54:20,122 --> 01:54:23,459
But vengeance isn't power
Anyone can take a life

1112
01:54:24,084 --> 01:54:25,628
But to give life

1113
01:54:26,170 --> 01:54:28,964
that's true power
A power you once had

1114
01:54:30,132 --> 01:54:32,009
She's alive

1115
01:54:37,723 --> 01:54:39,308
So I'm asking you

1116
01:54:40,351 --> 01:54:42,019
Victor Fries

1117
01:54:42,853 --> 01:54:44,730
help me save another life

1118
01:54:45,147 --> 01:54:48,150
Show me how to cure
Macgregor's Syndrome Stage 1

1119
01:54:48,692 --> 01:54:52,446
And maybe you can also save the life
of the man your wife once loved

1120
01:54:53,405 --> 01:54:55,366
He's still inside you, Victor

1121
01:54:56,408 --> 01:54:57,576
Buried

1122
01:54:57,868 --> 01:54:59,829
deep beneath the snow

1123
01:55:02,581 --> 01:55:04,124
Will you help me

1124
01:55:05,793 --> 01:55:06,335
Doctor?

1125
01:55:31,527 --> 01:55:33,529
Take 2 of these

1126
01:55:34,864 --> 01:55:36,782
and call me in the morning

1127
01:55:47,293 --> 01:55:50,004
I'll have your wife
moved to the lab at Arkham

1128
01:55:50,212 --> 01:55:52,631
You'll be able to continue
your research there

1129
01:56:16,280 --> 01:56:18,365
All we can do now is wait

1130
01:56:19,200 --> 01:56:21,076
and hope

1131
01:56:47,353 --> 01:56:49,104
He loves me

1132
01:56:50,689 --> 01:56:52,441
He loves me not

1133
01:56:54,860 --> 01:56:56,445
He loves me

1134
01:56:58,280 --> 01:56:59,448
Not!

1135
01:57:01,325 --> 01:57:02,785
Surprise

1136
01:57:02,993 --> 01:57:04,954
I'm your new cellmate

1137
01:57:07,373 --> 01:57:10,626
And I've come
to make your life a living hell

1138
01:57:11,627 --> 01:57:12,586
Prepare

1139
01:57:12,795 --> 01:57:14,672
for a bitter harvest

1140
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,468
Winter

1141
01:57:19,885 --> 01:57:21,762
has come at last

1142
01:58:07,433 --> 01:58:08,267
Are you  ?

1143
01:58:08,476 --> 01:58:13,272
Rather disappointed at how poorly
I have taught you proper housekeeping

1144
01:58:13,689 --> 01:58:15,566
And quite well, it seems!

1145
01:58:15,983 --> 01:58:17,443
Thanks to you, son

1146
01:58:17,526 --> 01:58:19,737
Thanks to you all

1147
01:58:20,029 --> 01:58:21,614
Well done, Bruce

1148
01:58:22,031 --> 01:58:24,033
You too
Well done

1149
01:58:25,367 --> 01:58:26,952
I got one question

1150
01:58:27,244 --> 01:58:30,998
When we fell off the telescope,
why didn't you try and save us?

1151
01:58:31,207 --> 01:58:33,292
It's the first time I've fallen
and you weren't there

1152
01:58:34,043 --> 01:58:35,294
I figured you could handle it

1153
01:58:35,461 --> 01:58:40,174
You know, sometimes counting on
somebody else is the only way to win

1154
01:58:43,093 --> 01:58:43,928
Excuse me

1155
01:58:44,136 --> 01:58:46,555
I'm the one who
kicked Ivy's botanical butt

1156
01:58:46,722 --> 01:58:47,806
Yeah, that was me

1157
01:58:48,098 --> 01:58:49,350
I did it all by myself

1158
01:58:49,642 --> 01:58:50,601
That was me

1159
01:58:50,810 --> 01:58:53,103
You are going back to school

1160
01:58:53,312 --> 01:58:54,980
You'll never win this argument

1161
01:59:00,069 --> 01:59:01,237
Partners?

1162
01:59:06,242 --> 01:59:07,076
Partners

1163
01:59:16,669 --> 01:59:18,420
Partners

1164
01:59:21,882 --> 01:59:23,968
We're going to need a bigger cave
