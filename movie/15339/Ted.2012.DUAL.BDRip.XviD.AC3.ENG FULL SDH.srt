your teddy bear.

l've been following you
ever since l was a young boy

00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,342
and l remember seeing you
on the Carson show.

You were just wonderful.

628
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:12,346
Oh, yeah, that was
a weird interview.

629
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:15,849
Ed thought l was ALF,
and he kept muttering
anti-Semitic comments.

630

He thought ALF was
Jewish for some reason.

631

Have you ever considered
selling the bear?

What?
Excuse me?

633

l'm not an "it," pal.
l'm a "he," all right?

635
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,152
l'm sorry, little guy,
but my bear isn't for sale.

636
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:29,112
See, l've had him
since l was about your age.

He's very, very
special to me.

you're talking to me.

would he say that?

swear in front of children.

just wants a chance

He currently
resides in Burbank

that sounded.
