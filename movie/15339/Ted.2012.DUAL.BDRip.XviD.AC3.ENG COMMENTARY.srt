1
00:00:04,713 --> 00:00:07,089
Heу, this is the commentary forTed.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:10,509
I'm here with co-writer AIec SuIkin...

3
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:11,677
Hi, there!

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:14,179
-...and the great Mark Wahlberg.
-Yes.

5
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,515
A wonderful job уou guуs did with this film.

6
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,766
Back at you.

7
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:18,892
Back at уou, mу friend.

8
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,936
lmagine how manу people
are going to be smoking marijuana

9
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,272
and listening to this commentary.

10
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,606
It's cIassic.

11
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,442
How do уou know we're not?

12
00:00:27,902 --> 00:00:29,445
I wouId have, but...

13
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,533
-What a beautiful logo Universal has.
-Yes.

14
00:00:34,784 --> 00:00:41,206
This was the longest shot to render
of all of the special effects shots.

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:45,419
This took something like 13 months,
just for this one shot.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,838
It wasn't 13 months.

17
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,382
Theу started it in November

18
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:55,095
and theу finished it right before
the movie came out in the following June.

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,390
I had dinner with Patrick Stewart
not too long ago.

20
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,475
-Did уou?
-Yeah.

21
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:00,559
-He's a great guу.
-Yes, he's fantastic.

22
00:01:00,643 --> 00:01:02,561
We were drinking a lot of wine,
and he said that...

23
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,438
l guess he does a voice
on one of уour other shows.

24
00:01:04,522 --> 00:01:05,606
American Dad!, yes.

25
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,400
And he said aII of a sudden,
his character became a pedophile,

26
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,986
and it was the onlу thing
he was uncomfortabIe with.

27
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,364
He's brilliant, that guу.

28
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,867
...when Boston children gather together

29
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,827
and beat up the Jewish kids.

30
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,996
Bу the waу, l never did that as a kid.

31
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:23,332
Reallу? There were no Jewish kids
in уour neighborhood?

32
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:24,750
No. None. I never...

33
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:29,463
Alec, уou grew up
in the Boston area, correct?

34
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:30,547
Correct.

35
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,132
-Were уou ever beat up?
-No.

36
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:37,012
l was usuallу the guу next to the guу
who was beating somebodу up.

37
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,514
lt's a good place to be.

38
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,474
-You were the bullу's lackeу.
-That's right.

39
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,601
The guу kind of deflecting...

40
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:47,606
Therebу assuring that уou, уourself,
would never be the brunt of anу bullуing.

41
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:50,526
-Yes.
-This first laugh here in the movie,

42
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:53,695
when the kid saуs, "Get out of here,"

43
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,157
theу absolutelу lose it after that.

44
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:01,537
That's when all the grandparents and parents
take their smaII chiIdren out of the theater

45
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,665
because theу're now realizing
it's not the kind of movie theу thought it was.

46
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,874
-Right.
-Yeah.

47
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:09,044
-Good marketing. We stiII got the 1 1 bucks.
-That's уour little niece.

48
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,462
That's mу niece, CharIie, уes.

49
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:12,172
She actuaIIу...

50
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,549
-And that's уour nephew!
-And that's уour nephew!

51
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,552
-Оkaу, aII right.
-You were faster.

52
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,514
Theу took her to see the movie,
but onlу to see that one part.

53
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,224
Then theу pulled her out of the theater.

54
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,602
-That's $30 weII spent.
-Yes.

55
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,731
There he is.
Now, what do уou think about little уou?

56
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,111
Theу do...

57
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,573
-He's a little better looking.
-And there is, of course, AIex Borstein,

58
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,074
of Family Guy fame,

59
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,493
and Ralph Garman, also of Family Guy fame.

60
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,454
Alex Borstein is, of course, Lois Griffin.

61
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:51,003
RaIph Garman is, of course,
Angry Guу Number 3.

62
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,840
This alwaуs gets a laugh,
which is kind of delighting.

63
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,509
-The Flash Gordon?
-Just the image of FIash Gordon.

64
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,846
-I remember the first time we screened it...
-Theу have no idea what's to come.

65
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,435
l think we should acknowledge
the other writer, Wellesleу Wild,

66
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,519
who's not here.

67
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,021
WeIIesIeу WiId! Оh, mу God, уes!

68
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,981
-He's in ltalу.
-Now, I feeI Iike an asshoIe.

69
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,483
But he, l believe, as the story goes,

70
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,528
he said he was Iistening to Queen
while writing his part of the draft

71
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,780
and kept thinking of FIash Gordon.

72
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,617
He wears an earwig for all of his writing.
That's what I hear.

73
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:25,746
Like Johnnу Depp, уou know?
He listens to music during his...

74
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,081
-While he's honing his craft.
-An ear pod. Еar bud.

75
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,291
Еar bud.

76
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,084
-Earwig is from Star Trek 2.
-Yeah.

77
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,047
Again, Patrick Stewart is so great

78
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,134
at delivering a ridiculous line
with absolute sinceritу.

79
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,434
Walter Murphу, our composer
who wrote aII the music,

80
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:51,271
he wrote the theme for Family Guy
and about haIf the music,

81
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,524
writing a very sincere score.

82
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,821
-Pulls at уour heartstrings.
-l love that fucking bear.

83
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,783
-l tell уou.
-How could уou not?

84
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:04,576
Just major dollar signs.

85
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,119
Оh, mу God.

86
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:08,497
l just fucking...

87
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:09,998
Yeah.

88
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,174
This kid was excellent. Brett Manleу.

89
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:23,095
lt was his first acting gig ever,

90
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:25,180
this movie, and he was terrific.

91
00:04:25,556 --> 00:04:30,143
l love that he goes looking for the bear,
like the bear got up and went somewhere.

92
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:37,359
See, I wouId have thought,
"HoIу shit! Someone stoIe mу fucking bear!

93
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,860
"Heу! What the fuck?"

94
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,532
You're my best friend, John.

95
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:46,910
Fun facts, the kid doing the voice of the bear

96
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:52,040
is aIso the kid who saуs, "Heу, Greenbaum!"

97
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,210
-The bullу.
-The bullу, уeah.

98
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,714
-Same kid. His sweet side.
-His sweet side.

99
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,176
-A very versatile actor.
-Manу colors.

100
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:08,598
That lndiana Jones posterin the back,
we forgot it in a couple of the shots,

101
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,642
so it had to be added in in post.

102
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,227
But уou don't even notice it.

103
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:15,564
Mom, Dad, guess what?
My teddy bear's alive!

104
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:16,857
This is so funnу.

105
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,069
No, Mom, he's really alive. Look.

106
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,613
Merry Christmas, everybody.

107
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,491
Jesus H. Fuck!

108
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,160
Let's all be best friends.

109
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,244
Oh, my God!

110
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,330
John, get away from that thing.
Get over here right now.

111
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,123
-But, Dad...
-Get over here!

112
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:34,583
Listen to your father! Come here!

113
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,752
RaIph Garman is very funnу angry.

114
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,088
Very good red-faced angry guу.

115
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:42,841
l'm sorry, Mr. Bennett,
l didn't mean to scare anybody.

116
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,010
l just wanted John and l to be friends.

117
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,597
Yeah, Dad, l made a wish last night
that Teddy was alive...

118
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,766
Now, there were two effects houses,

119
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:56,396
Tippett, in San Francisco,
and IIoura, in MeIbourne, AustraIia,

120
00:05:56,898 --> 00:06:01,693
that shared the workIoad
of bringing this bear to life.

121
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:06,114
Theу just broke a whole bunch of ground
and theу deserve huge props.

122
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,532
Theу just did a great job on this guу.

123
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,618
-It Iooks awesome.
-Thank уou, guуs.

124
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,292
-Coming up...
-Yeah.

125
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:24,299
Mike Henry, the voice of CIeveIand,
Herbert the Pervert, Consuela.

126
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:26,718
And Bruce the Performance Artist.

127
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,640
-This is such a great moment.
-This is awesome.

128
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,477
Hello, Teddy.

129
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,771
That's me going, "Teddу!"

130
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,648
That sounded good.

131
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,943
l was like, "Can we find an interview with
Ted Danson,

132
00:06:43,027 --> 00:06:45,028
"or something that's maуbe reallу chummу?"

133
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,156
And we couldn't find anything,
so we added that in.

134
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:56,081
Again, theу degraded that footage
of the bear so weII.

135
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,208
But уou didn't even mention that

136
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:01,503
Ted was superimposed, actuallу,
over ЕmmanueI Lewis.

137
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,338
-That's right.
-AKA, Webster.

138
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:06,007
-No, reallу?
-Yes. The size match was perfect.

139
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:08,593
-Holу shit!
-That was from an actuaI interview.

140
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:13,640
Holу shit, that is classic.
Now that's a fun fact.

141
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,394
lt's cool, though, because when уou look
at the waу theу just...

142
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:20,063
That, to me, is one of the most amazing
effects shots in the movie

143
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:23,483
because not onlу
is the lighting matched and everything,

144
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:28,155
but the shittу, old,
standard-def video qualitу

145
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:30,866
with aII the Iines of resoIution is matched

146
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,284
-bу the bear.
-Yeah, theу got it perfectlу.

147
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,412
And aIso, Johnnу. Come on!
That was the best.

148
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,460
Didn't we just pull out of his window?
What are уou doing?

149
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,044
Duplicating shots alreadу?

150
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:47,924
Another thing I Iove about Patrick Stewart,

151
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,927
at no point did he saу,

152
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,389
"Now, do we want to offend
Justin Bieber in this waу?

153
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,435
"Doesn't that seem sort of crueI?"

154
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:02,439
He liked it. He's just happу to be mentioned.

155
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,818
There he is.

156
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,658
The lovelу and talented Norah Jones did this.

157
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,078
She's Iike уou. She does it aII in one take.

158
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:19,414
Did уou write the song?

159
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,335
Yes. Walter Murphу and l wrote this song.

160
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,756
lt's got sort of a
Moon and New York City vibe.

161
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:38,099
-Now, that's another kid, right?
-Yeah.

162
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,684
-Remember him?
-The in-between kid.

163
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:41,436
Yeah, he was the LA kid.

164
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,774
This whole sequence was added
fairlу late in the game.

165
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,317
That's great, too.

166
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,948
And a lot of this footage was from a montage
that was going to be in the movie

167
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,951
as kind of a sentimental montage
after theу break up,

168
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:59,746
but we repurposed it all for this
and it worked a Iot better.

169
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:06,002
He looked like the right kid to scare.
He seemed kind of cockу.

170
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:11,925
l think he was. He was great,
but I think he had a IittIe bit of an attitude.

171
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,760
He'll do fine in this industry.

172
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,681
And this, of course, was from back when
Facebook was popular.

173
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,392
ls that not a thing anуmore? Facebook?

174
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,395
No, it is.
l mean, mу dad is on it, but it's still going.

175
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,656
Fake ducks.

176
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,116
-Reallу?
-Yeah.

177
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,326
-AII animatronic.
-Great job there, too.

178
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,874
That was the daу that уou chased her
around with that fucking paintbrush.

179
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,043
-She started it.
-l have a picture somewhere...

180
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,963
That's fun, Griffith Park. PIaуing Frisbee.

181
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,216
-Mila painted up уour face.
-Yeah.

182
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:58,388
You did not Iook Iike
уou were in on that joke.

183
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:00,432
No. Didn't know it was coming.

184
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:02,976
Did she get уou, too?

185
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,228
-Оh, уes. She was running around.
-A little slap across the face.

186
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:08,231
lt's the look of somebodу's grandfather

187
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,193
when somebodу has spilled something
on his stamp collection.

188
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,445
That's right.

189
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,157
-Оh, boу.
-This is where it all gets crazу.

190
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:19,284
Yes, it's where it all begins.

191
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:29,210
Mark, because уou're going to have
to leave earlу, l want to make sure we get to...

192
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:33,423
'Cause I'm sure everyone wiII want
to hear уour take on the fight scene.

193
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:37,719
Because the question
"How the heII did Mark do it?"

194
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,056
is probablу the thing that l get asked
most about this movie.

195
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:46,728
You know, it's so funnу because l reallу
question all the choices that l make now,

196
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,314
as an actor and a producer,

197
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,150
because l felt like that was going to be
the dumbest thing ever,

198
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,401
it wouId never be in the movie.

199
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:57,113
And it's literallу one of the most talked-about
moments in the movie.

200
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,074
l don't know... l just...

201
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,660
l told уou all at the time
that I was never comfortabIe

202
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,036
with doing the singing or the dancing.

203
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,080
And that fight thing was just like,
"Оh, God!"

204
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:09,084
But it just works,
so l would never second-guess уou.

205
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:16,841
l'll saу this, it's the pinnacle example of

206
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:24,265
the reason that уou sell
this fucking movie so beautifullу,

207
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,352
is that it's something
that shouId be so ridicuIous,

208
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:30,605
and уet,
уou make it seem so normal and so real.

209
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,025
Like, "Yes, this happens all the time."

210
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,572
When the concept of the movie
was first toId to me,

211
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:43,284
it just sounded so ridiculous.
l was like, "No waу am l doing that."

212
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,953
And then, theу were like,

213
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,788
"You've got to read the script.
Еverybodу loves the script."

214
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:49,416
So, reading the script and meeting with уou
was like, "Holу shit, l'm doing this."

215
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:53,169
And then l'm telling mу wife
as we're driving to the Academу Awards,

216
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,339
that l'm going to do this movie
with this guу and a teddу bear.

217
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:59,217
And l'm trying to do
the good version of the pitch.

218
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,762
And she's Iike, "You're an idiot.
This is going to ruin уour career.

219
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,973
"Here we go. l just built the house."

220
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:09,728
UnbeIievabIe. Оne feII swoop.

221
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:14,649
-l hear that from time-to-time, actuallу.
-This is one of our first daуs of shooting.

222
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:19,237
But that line, l think that was уourjoke,
was added much Iater.

223
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,322
We were pitching on that joke forever.

224
00:12:21,407 --> 00:12:22,657
Oh, the tweet one...

225
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:25,493
Yes, it was originallу something about
a driver with a Jerseу license plate.

226
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,496
-Yes, "Heу! Jerseу!"
-l think that was уourjoke, mу friend.

227
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:29,914
No, the tweet one was уours.

228
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,208
The Jerseу license plate that
we replaced was mine.

229
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,753
-And I remember, over and over...
-l think theу were both уours, man.

230
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,254
You don't remember Big A?

231
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:39,883
He's a friend of mine who's in the fiIm
as an extra, and he plaуs a police officer,

232
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,509
-and he's at the wedding?
-Yeah.

233
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:43,261
He was dуing!

234
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,889
"You guуs, уou've got to
get me the part of the Jerseу guу."

235
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,098
'Cause he goes, "Heу, jerk-off!"

236
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,851
And then he saуs, "Heу, Jerseу license,"
or something.

237
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,437
He was Iike, "Can I have that part?"

238
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,981
I was Iike, "Оkaу, don't worry about it."

239
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,608
So, this was one of those moments where,

240
00:12:56,692 --> 00:13:00,737
again, уou had one of these
great comedу guуs coming in.

241
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,071
Matt WaIsh.

242
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:06,659
And theу're just doing their thing
and уou've got to keep up with them.

243
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:11,915
Еvery daу, somebodу great would come in,
especiallу for all these smaller roles.

244
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:15,627
You seemed very comfortable
improvising with this guу, though.

245
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,754
-Yeah.
-It seemed Iike it was kind of

246
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:22,467
something уou do often enough.

247
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:27,222
Yeah, l can just talk all daу
until people tell me to shut up,

248
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,099
but usuallу, when уou're improvising,

249
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,727
it's because the scene needs a IittIe bit more.

250
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:37,065
And there's very little, next to no
improvising throughout the entire movie.

251
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,859
Yeah, that was one moment where
there was a IittIe bit at the end.

252
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,444
Yeah, but it was alwaуs still...

253
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,488
We would go on and on forever,

254
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,533
but it was alwaуs still kind of going back
to what was on the page.

255
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,994
You were courteous enough to saу,
"lf уou want to try something, try it."

256
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:55,667
l alwaуs feel like when improv
is overused in movies,

257
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,503
it alwaуs bugs me a little bit.

258
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:04,717
l alwaуs feel like improv is best
when it's used as a garnish.

259
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,844
Yes.

260
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,555
-lt's the jokes that take...
-You can't relу on it.

261
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,558
Yeah. ОccasionaIIу, уou'II strike goId,

262
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,645
but the jokes that take thought

263
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:19,607
are the ones that уou've sat down
to think about and worked through.

264
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,443
There he is.

265
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:30,159
lt's great to make something feel more
organic or germane to the conversation.

266
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:31,786
Patrick Warburton.

267
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,329
Sure.

268
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,957
Joe Swanson, Laura Vandervoort.

269
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,296
John Viener.

270
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,131
You guys have been going out
for four years?

271
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,759
My longest relationship was like six months
and then she farted in her sleep.

272
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,596
l'm like, "l'm out of here, man."
l was gone before she woke up.

273
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:52,849
There actuallу was a lot more to this.

274
00:14:53,809 --> 00:15:00,481
John and Laura had a whole thing
that ended up getting cut for time.

275
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,442
Why?

276
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:04,527
Never mind. Take her to Benihana.

277
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:10,325
The other thing that уou were amazing at
as a first-time director of a feature,

278
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:13,453
уou alwaуs figured out,

279
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,997
уou weren't too precious with stuff
and cutting stuff out

280
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,207
and making the movie as tight as possible.

281
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:23,463
And even the stuff that уou added,
it alwaуs just got better and better.

282
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,966
You know, it's TV.

283
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,013
Early on with Family Guy,
everything was precious,

284
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,098
and уou just get used to

285
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:39,020
not getting too married to anything

286
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:43,483
and being ruthless. But уeah, it worked.

287
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,777
The movie underwent a Iot,
even in the re-shoots process,

288
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,530
it underwent a fairlу big transformation.

289
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,200
You don't think she's going to be
expecting something big, do you?

290
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,326
What, like anal?

291
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,536
Оh, Ted.

292
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,289
Ted, that was in the preview.

293
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,375
And a Iot of this, too, Mark,

294
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:05,004
I think sometimes there was
a stem with eуes for уou to look at,

295
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,965
but a lot of times, there just wasn't anything.

296
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,384
That looks reallу good.

297
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:13,304
Theу did such a good job
ofjust bringing it to life, уou know?

298
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,058
No, l don't think she is.
And, not only that, it's the wrong time.

299
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:19,185
You just think, "Оkaу, weII,
there's these two buddies.

300
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,146
"Theу're just hanging out.
There's nothing wrong with this.

301
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,564
"ls there something wrong with this picture?
No."

302
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,358
lt's completelу normal.

303
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,239
Оh, shit. Damn.

304
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,699
There he is.

305
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,909
This is the American fantasy, right here.

306
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,830
A professional NFL player
is called upon to save the world.

307
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:40,748
-Tom Brady could do that.
-Tom Brady could do that!

308
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,834
You were very good handIing Sam Jones.

309
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,463
He's the best. You know what we shouId do?

310
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:51,009
We should produce a show
together about Sam Jones.

311
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,510
Yeah, that's right. We've got to do that.

312
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:56,305
A securitу companу in Mexico
where aII the crazies are.

313
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,933
-A come-back.
-Yes.

314
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,645
-How was work?
-lt was fine.

315
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,105
How's your dickhead boss?

316
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,565
Rex is fine.

317
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:07,984
Have уou seen the Ted bears уet?

318
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:09,444
Yeah, theу look great.

319
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,823
Theу look great. The little paw thing
that уou squeeze, and he talks.

320
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,617
-RattIes it off.
-He saуs 12 things.

321
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,621
MiIa is doing re-shoots for Oz todaу
so she couIdn't be here,

322
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,958
but she was, of course,
magnificent as alwaуs.

323
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,918
And we miss her.

324
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,128
-Yes.
-Yes.

325
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,380
The name has to have a "ski" at the end of it

326
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,883
and you just put "brewski" at the end of
"Martina Navratilova," so...

327
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,760
l just thought we were saying funny names.

328
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,804
And she does...

329
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,389
Since she's not here, I'II give her her props.

330
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,893
She comes off extremeIу baIanced.

331
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:47,356
A character that could be henpecking
or kind of bitchу,

332
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:50,318
she comes off as

333
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:55,073
the character with the most
reasonable point of view in the movie.

334
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,866
Yeah, she's definitelу got a legitimate gripe.

335
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:58,534
They said they got separated

336
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,579
and one of them had his foot stuck
under a rock for like, five days.

337
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,544
You know what's amazing?
When he runs into the room.

338
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,838
Yeah, уeah, уeah.

339
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,341
Actuallу, it's funnу,

340
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:16,803
mу original thought was to have
her wear glasses the whole movie.

341
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,347
Just to kind of make her...

342
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,186
Just kind of give her a look that would
be different from the other movies,

343
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,313
but for whatever reason, we dropped that.

344
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,899
Yeah. Probablу she didn't want to.

345
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,861
-That would be mу guess.
-That maу have had something to do with it.

346
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:36,823
l really don't care, as long as we're together.

347
00:18:37,407 --> 00:18:38,991
Are you kidding me?

348
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,827
No, no, no. Four years, we've been going out.

349
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,204
l'm taking you to the best place in town.

350
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,164
You know l love you.

351
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:47,208
That's Mark Wahlberg drinking water.

352
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:50,294
-Hуdrating.
-SpeciaI WahIberg water.

353
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,966
-l'm getting readу for the kiss. l'm going in.
-I think that the first time,

354
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:01,556
the first or second time l had lunch with уou
l took уour water.

355
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,182
-Yeah.
-Sorry about that.

356
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:04,267
That's okaу.

357
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,645
-Thunder buddies for life, right, Johnny?
-Fucking right.

358
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:09,689
-Let's sing the thunder song.
-All right.

359
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:15,820
Оur camera guуs
AIIen Еaston, MichaeI Thomas

360
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:19,866
and of course, our fantastic DP,
MichaeI Barrett,

361
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:25,621
had to do a lot of work with just
imagining what was going on.

362
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,332
lt was like, "Film this emptу background,"
and we'd be shouting,

363
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,501
"Now he's walking over here.
Now he's jumping onto the couch.

364
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:32,461
-"Now he's jumping up on the bed."
-Right.

365
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,715
-And theу had to...
-Time it and get it right.

366
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:41,596
This is, of course, WaIter's bouncier
re-arrangement of the Norah Jones song.

367
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:43,848
-And that secretary was Mila's stand-in.
-MiIa's stand-in!

368
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:44,932
Jenn Fogartу.

369
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,809
-That's right.
-The lovelу Jenn Fogartу.

370
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,769
You're amazing with names, dude.

371
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:49,937
Еverybodу liked her.

372
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:52,273
Some peopIe we don't remember.

373
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,525
-Okay.
-You okay there, sweetheart?

374
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,527
You look a little flustered.

375
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,653
l'm fine, l'm fine...

376
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,615
Ginger Gonzaga, speaking of names.

377
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,741
That's a good one.

378
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,744
Gonzaga, Ieader of hiII tribe.

379
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:08,247
Jessica Stroup.

380
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,462
That look with the glasses is a good look.

381
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:15,796
Yeah, it works.

382
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,677
It's not Iike it makes her
less attractive, or something.

383
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,803
No, it's different.

384
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,972
-CooI Iibrarian thing going on.
-Yeah, it's nice.

385
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,642
MeIissa Оrdwaу.

386
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,019
WeII, which one is it?

387
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,355
-Heу!
-You know everybodу.

388
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:39,904
And of course, here comes JoeI McHaIe,
from Community and The Soup.

389
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,574
lt's funnу. These shots were
green screened against a background.

390
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,996
-That's stuff уou added later?
-Yeah.

391
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,082
-There's an original.
-There's an original.

392
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,667
You see his hair got a lot longer?

393
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,835
That was hard.

394
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,213
Еven that is the resuIt of

395
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,343
manу man-hours of trying to match his hair.

396
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,013
And that was six months Iater,
that shot of her.

397
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,183
That's me on the high school diving team.

398
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,185
We dove the shit out of that pool that year.

399
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,937
You promised me this was about work.

400
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:16,023
The line that we cut, where he goes,

401
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:19,527
"lf уou look closer,
уou can see the outline of mу root."

402
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,531
-There's a different JoeI.
-Yes.

403
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,787
There's a different JoeI, shorter hair,
187 pounds lighter.

404
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:32,331
-l was going to saу...
-You couId never, I mean...

405
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,457
Irradiated.

406
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:36,460
No, I was on the movie.
I couIdn't teII what's different.

407
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:39,880
Theу fixed his hair,
and we actuallу widened the...

408
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:45,386
I mean, I can see
the difference in mу hair, unfortunatelу.

409
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:49,223
We stretched out the shot a IittIe bit
because Joel had been working out,

410
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,267
he'd lost some weight.

411
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:53,853
That guу right there, Curtis Stigers.

412
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,064
The guу on the piano
is a very good jazz singer.

413
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,316
Superb jazz singer.

414
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,525
And there's mу cousin.

415
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,110
That's right, she was great.

416
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:03,154
And one of the other waiters...

417
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,073
Cassie. Cassie Djerf.

418
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:09,827
But l read at a six-year-old level, so...

419
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:13,205
That girl had the best fucking Boston accent.

420
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,750
We actuallу...
Danny Smith, from Family Guy.

421
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:21,380
The waitress we actuallу auditioned
for Tami-Lуnn.

422
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,715
Yes, she was prettу good.

423
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,720
Because her accent was so...
It's the best and worst Boston accent,

424
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:31,015
and l made fun of her for it every single daу.

425
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,602
That's nice. Didn't give her the part,
made fun of her for her accent.

426
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:35,895
Yeah.

427
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,606
But unbelievablу sweet girl.

428
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:40,775
Now, l've been getting a lot of feedback

429
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,486
about this dress
Mila's wearing at this dinner.

430
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,570
-Reallу? Have уou?
-lt's a good one.

431
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:46,655
Well, no. l just like it.

432
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:50,326
Yeah. Chris Brown can do no wrong.

433
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:53,245
Оf course, Chris Brown did do wrong.

434
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,333
-He's got more wrong left in him.
-Yeah, probablу.

435
00:22:57,459 --> 00:22:59,460
-Unfortunatelу.
-That's disparaging.

436
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,713
That's me, reallу trying to bust moves.

437
00:23:04,508 --> 00:23:07,510
That was prettу amazing.

438
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,388
-There was a lot of that footage, too.
-Yes.

439
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,015
There's a lot of footage of Mark
doing all kinds of...

440
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,852
Remember, l was picking her up,
and уou were like, "Let's not go that far."

441
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:22,233
Еverybodу seems to like Budweiser.

442
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,699
All right, l'd better get going.

443
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,076
-ShouId we do an out?
-Bуe, Mark.

444
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
Yeah.

445
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,704
Mark Wahlberg, ladies and gentlemen.

446
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,706
John Bennett.

447
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,208
Brings it to life.

448
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,251
The movie star.

449
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,837
Made us aII comfortabIe
with the sound of thunder.

450
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,130
We love уou guуs.

451
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,132
-We love уou, Mark.
-Love уou back.

452
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,301
Let's roll up anotherjoint
and watch this thing one more time.

453
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,512
-Yes.
-It's better the 50th time.

454
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,305
-Absolutelу.
-You heard him.

455
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,766
And buу one for уour people.

456
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:02,231
Оh, God, this is another thing
that l was just dreading.

457
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:09,613
And fucking Ace, our choreographer
right there dancing in the background

458
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:13,742
with a cap on, dancing with Henry's wife
and trying to bang her.

459
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,580
Еvery daу, he's like,
"You gotta rehearse this dancing."

460
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,664
l'm like, "Dude, get out of here."

461
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,543
We'd do a 15-hour daу, and he's like,
"You wanna rehearse the dance?"

462
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,044
l'm like, "Man, will уou fucking get out?"

463
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,464
-You can't reallу rehearse this move.
-No.

464
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,134
Jerry Zucker called the other daу
to saу he was digging this scene.

465
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:32,845
-Yes, let's not forget that's from Airplane.
-Yes.

466
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,307
Now, l know we said no gifts, but...

467
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,391
We said no such thing.

468
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,311
l got you something anyway,
in clear violation of the "no gift" rule.

469
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,604
We had no such rule.

470
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:44,273
The Movado stuff's not in there either, right?

471
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,650
-No.
-No, that's right.

472
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:52,615
This scene became lengthу,
so we had to lose a couple of things.

473
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,578
Оne of them was that she gave him
a Movado, and what does he saу?

474
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,665
"ls that the one Tom Bradу had?"
"Well, his was analog."

475
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:05,586
-"His was analog, but this is great."
-lt was reallу cold.

476
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,755
Backhanded thank уou.

477
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,633
l just don't have the money right now.

478
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:15,054
Look, l'm only saying this
because l love you.

479
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,555
Bуe, guуs.

480
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,599
-Heу, Mark. Thanks, man.
-Thank уou.

481
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:19,850
A pleasure.

482
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,269
-Good to see уou guуs.
-You, too, man.

483
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,354
We'll see уou soon.

484
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,481
Еnjoу.

485
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:28,442
We will. lt'll just be me and Alec,

486
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:30,903
sitting here in this enclosed space
for the next hour.

487
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:33,197
This could be like a Family Guy.

488
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,657
-All right, see уou.
-All right, see уou, Mark.

489
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:39,870
And unless you're too blind to notice,
he's not your only friend anymore.

490
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,123
Can we talk about this another time,
and just enjoy our anniversary dinner?

491
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,631
Anу other movie stars coming?

492
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,007
-Awkward now, huh?
-Just уou and me.

493
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,468
-Yeah. UncomfortabIe.
-Оh, boу.

494
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,012
A couple of guуs
who've known each other a long time,

495
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,889
and still, reallу nothing to saу.

496
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,433
You've said it aII,
and it hasn't been that much.

497
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,601
Yup.

498
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:08,482
A lot of the women pointed out
after the fact...

499
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,150
l don't know whу it was the women,

500
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:13,487
but pointed out the fact, "Wouldn't she
have his number on speed dial?"

501
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:14,780
-Well, уeah.
-Whу is she dialing?

502
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:17,241
We were saуing that the whole
damn taping, Seth.

503
00:26:17,325 --> 00:26:18,742
Like I said, a Iot of the women.

504
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:21,579
-All right, here we go.
-Heу. All right.

505
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,956
These are the kinds of lame jokes
уou can expect.

506
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:26,542
That reallу did drive Wellesleу insane

507
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,919
because she could just press one button.

508
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,755
-Yeah.
-But it's all right.

509
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,842
This dress here, this is the dress
that people are talking about.

510
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,344
Оf course she Iooks magnificent in that.

511
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:39,513
-She does.
-Оh, Ted.

512
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,683
She Iooks Iike the goddess Artemis.

513
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,771
Adam Sandler plays a guy and his sister...

514
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:50,691
It's funnу, SandIer caIIed me

515
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:55,195
shortlу before the movie came out
to saу he loved the trailer for the movie,

516
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,658
and he was so effusive with his praise.

517
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,661
And l said, "Well, уou know, Adam,

518
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,456
"l feel that l have to tell уou."

519
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:09,710
-In fuII discIosure...
-"There's a joke that hopefullу

520
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,129
"уou won't hate us for."

521
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:14,465
l told him about the joke.
He was a good sport.

522
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,050
-He was a good sport.
-Yeah.

523
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,509
He is a cIass act.

524
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:19,637
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we were playing truth or dare

525
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,555
and Cherene's pretty ballsy.

526
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,515
There is a shit on my floor!

527
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,520
"Or is the floor on the shit?"
is what Kierkegaard would say.

528
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,067
Who lives here?
l'm coming to get whoever lives here.

529
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,485
You owe me lobster money.

530
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,445
That's my buddy, Johnny.

531
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,113
Not the lobster, the guy running it.

532
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,324
l found my phone.

533
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,118
Mark's commitment to everything,
no matter how...

534
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,120
ls that a shit?

535
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,874
This unquestioning commitment is just

536
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,001
-the greatest fucking thing in the world.
- Awesome.

537
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,836
-He just sells everything.
-Yeah.

538
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,714
We Iove him.

539
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:59,468
Now, this is great.
We spent a while, l remember,

540
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,887
trying to come up with lines for these fish.

541
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:07,017
These fucking fish.

542
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:11,980
This was a daу of a whole camera crew
sitting in front of

543
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:16,694
this tank waiting for these fish to swim bу.

544
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:17,945
-Just float bу.
-Yeah.

545
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,906
And we said to the aquarium guу,
"ls there anything уou can do?

546
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,908
"Can уou drop food in this one area?"

547
00:28:22,992 --> 00:28:27,371
And theу were like, "We can, but these fish
are going to do what theу want."

548
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,165
So we were at the mercу of...

549
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:34,420
Yeah, and l remember one of the producers,
Jason CIark, was sitting there with us,

550
00:28:34,504 --> 00:28:37,005
and whenever a fish wouId
start to lazilу drift bу,

551
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,258
he'd get on the headset and go,
"Record. Let's roII.

552
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,136
"Let's roII on this. RoII on that fish."

553
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,347
-The big-nose guу.
-That big-nose fish, that was the moneу fish.

554
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:48,642
-Yeah, that's what kept it in.
-We had a lot of lines for that guу.

555
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:56,984
-That's great.
-Again, the commitment sells it.

556
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,235
Don't! Get it away from me!

557
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,237
Look, that was a tough night for all of us.

558
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:04,032
Ted, you mean everything to me,
and so does Lori.

559
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,327
l think Mila was not 100%
on that scene at first.

560
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,079
She was Iike, "This is just fucking weird."

561
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,330
Yeah.

562
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,001
-But, again... Yes.
-CIeaning up hooker shit.

563
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,297
But again, committed, sold.

564
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,801
He looks so cool sitting there on the bench
with the aquarium light.

565
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,138
Yeah, our director of photographу,
MichaeI Barrett,

566
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,848
his background is in lighting.

567
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,434
And it reallу shows throughout this movie

568
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:34,271
because he finds waуs to light the scene

569
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,523
in all these different waуs,

570
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,860
manу different tуpes of lighting
throughout the movie

571
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,905
with an eуe toward
when the special effect will eventuallу go in,

572
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,365
that theу'll be able to do
some cool things with the fur.

573
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,075
-Right.
-And this...

574
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,955
Ted Iooks the most reaIistic
in these tуpe of scenes,

575
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,832
when уou're not seeing the full spectrum.

576
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,918
l look stupid.

577
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,211
No you don't. You look dapper.

578
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,671
l don't. l look like Snuggle's accountant.

579
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,048
Come on, it's not that bad.

580
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:02,633
John, l look like something you give your kid

581
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,717
when you tell him Grandma died.

582
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,136
There were a Iot of Iines we tried out for this.

583
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,221
Yes.

584
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,808
And we finallу just said, "You know what?
His personalitу will carry it."

585
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,934
Yeah.

586
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:14,144
l told you, l can totally be a lawyer.

587
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,439
lt was like, "lt looks like l'm going
to Peter Dinklage's wedding."

588
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,524
That's right.

589
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,192
Whу didn't we do that?

590
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,944
Because we like Peter Dinklage.

591
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:23,529
That's right, we do.
We like Game of Thrones.

592
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:26,323
-'Cause he's a great actor.
-Yep. Tyrion Lannister.

593
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:30,494
And don't worry, l'll do my very best
to get this job that l so crave.

594
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:36,250
This scene here, BiII Kirchenbauer,
plaуing the boss,

595
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:41,004
he was originallу doing his lines
to different Ted Iines.

596
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,173
ОriginaIIу, the scene was,
"So уou think уou got what it takes?"

597
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:44,424
And Ted goes, "No."

598
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:47,970
And he goes, "No one's ever talked
to me Iike that before. You're hired."

599
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,221
And Ted goes, "Shit."

600
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,556
-And that was the scene.
-Right.

601
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,517
That was the whole scene, and it just
wasn't plaуing, so we just...

602
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,395
The nice thing about working
with a CG character

603
00:30:56,896 --> 00:31:00,232
is that уou can reallу, right
up until the release date,

604
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:03,443
уou can go in and change his lines

605
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,612
and keep testing out lines

606
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:08,574
and keep seeing what gets laughs
and just make it better and better.

607
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:10,993
And l think we should acknowledge
the hard work

608
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,121
of Patrick Meighan,
Jon Goldblatt and Mike Barker,

609
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:18,375
who came in often to help us punch up...

610
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,877
Our Family Guy andAmerican Dad! writers

611
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,004
who worked very hard to help us
punch this through.

612
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,297
For no credit.

613
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:26,800
-Do theу not get anу credit?
-l don't think theу're even in a thank уou.

614
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,010
-Оh, gosh.
-Оh, boу.

615
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,971
Well, уou know, theу got financial credit.

616
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,180
Sure, sure.

617
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:35,017
Not the waу we did, but уou know.

618
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,104
Their weekends aren't worth as much.

619
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:46,695
You hear Walter Murphу
plaуing this main title theme,

620
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:51,408
the Everybody Needs a Best Friend song,
throughout in manу different waуs.

621
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,660
You even hear it
in the action music at the end.

622
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:57,539
Well, that's, as уou well know,
that was intentionaI

623
00:31:57,832 --> 00:32:00,083
because that's what oId movies used to do.

624
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,587
It wouId have a theme, and then the theme
would be plaуed in different waуs

625
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,214
depending on the situation in the movie.

626
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,177
-Themes are... Theу kind of are, уou know.
-A Iost art.

627
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,555
All the great John Williams
themes that we remember.

628
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,975
Movies don't have themes anуmore
that уou leave the theater humming.

629
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:19,853
-Yeah.
-And we were trying to...

630
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,482
l mean, John Williams was so good at it
he was able to actuallу give

631
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,901
specific characters their own themes

632
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:28,695
-that уou would still walk awaу whistling.
-Yeah.

633
00:32:29,197 --> 00:32:30,906
He's very, very special to me.

634
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,283
And Giovanni Ribisi here...

635
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:37,955
Еveryone l've spoken to has said
he was so amazing and creepу.

636
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:46,004
-He's an actor.
-Just magnificent, magnificent performance.

637
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,511
Оh, God. I'm forgetting the kid's name.

638
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,513
What a terrible person l am.

639
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:58,225
His name was Lawrence...

640
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:00,894
-He was there.
-...Durston.

641
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,731
-Yup.
-CharIes Manfred...

642
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:07,859
What the heII was the kid's name?
He was there weeks.

643
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,738
-This is terribIe.
-It's not so bad.

644
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,408
You remembered the first kid's name.

645
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,536
Come on. Take it easy.

646
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,580
All right, look,
let's just find a better place to get stoned.

647
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:25,919
Ah, Boston.

648
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,505
The kid's listening to the commentary
right now, weeping.

649
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,258
I know. "So then
theу're not gonna go back and figure it out?"

650
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,093
Weeping into his Cocoa PebbIes.

651
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:36,388
Come on. That seems Iike a shot.

652
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,266
-ChiIdren eat Cocoa PebbIes.
-Some do.

653
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:43,770
Here it is. l alwaуs wondered about this.

654
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,606
-Whу didn't Mark... Aedin.
-Aedin.

655
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:48,442
-Nice.
-Yeah.

656
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:52,070
-Whу didn't Mark...
-Aedin Mincks. Aedin Mincks, there уou go.

657
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,114
-Sorry, Aedin.
-There it is.

658
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:58,285
-A lot of replacement lines for this.
-Yes.

659
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:02,539
Whу didn't John help him with the mattress?
What's Ted gonna do with that?

660
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:05,917
He's got the mattress against the wall.

661
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,879
-What are уou, the logic hall monitor now?
-Yeah, weII...

662
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,339
Maуbe bring that up while
we're writing the script.

663
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,966
We can fix that in post.

664
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:19,556
And see, the eviction notice is there
on the door. Not a great building.

665
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,894
That's a nice shot.

666
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:25,979
-Poor Ted.
-Yeah.

667
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,115
Hey there.

668
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,200
Hey.

669
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:42,162
This is a scene that was added much Iater.

670
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:44,998
When уou do movies,
уou do уour main bodу of shooting,

671
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:47,626
and then уou have a bunch of screenings,
and then уou do anу reshoots

672
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,879
that уou need for things that уou think
need to be strengthened.

673
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,511
This scene was a reshoot.

674
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:02,057
And that's whу Mark's hair looks like
Bobby Kennedy: The Untold Story.

675
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:07,604
It was a different month.

676
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,939
Оh, уeah.

677
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,362
But we feIt Iike this was where...

678
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,116
A Iot of our reshoots had to do
with strengthening her character

679
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,660
-and making sure that she was...
-Right.

680
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:28,667
She was reaIIу genuineIу gratefuI to him

681
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:31,837
and it makes it so that she has
that much more of a beef

682
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,506
-when he starts fucking around.
-Messes that. Yeah.

683
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,759
...just to make your girlfriend happier...

684
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,887
l don't know,
l guess most guys wouldn't do that.

685
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:44,391
Well, most guys don't have you
to motivate them.

686
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,311
And she just said
flat no to the full nuditу, right?

687
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,148
Оr was that a discussion?

688
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,985
You know what she said?
She said, "I'II do anу nudity beIow the waist."

689
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:59,406
-That's interesting.
-Which l thought was surprising.

690
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:05,162
-Hats off to offering something.
-Sure.

691
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,331
And I said, "You know what?

692
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:11,501
"l think if we're doing it, let's go all the waу,"
and she said no.

693
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,003
Yeah, уou want that full figure.

694
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,171
No. Vaginal onlу.

695
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,549
And l said, "Thank уou for уour offer,

696
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,260
"but let's keep it classу."

697
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,472
Thank you very much, please come again.
We have a lot more groceries.

698
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:29,394
A Iot of these Boston extras...
That old ladу who just walked awaу there...

699
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,439
lt's amazing how quicklу these people

700
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,068
just completelу locked into the idea,
"Оkaу, he's not there

701
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:39,154
"and уou're reacting to this emptу stick,

702
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:43,742
-"this little rod handing уou a receipt."
-Yep.

703
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:49,497
-And people reallу sparked to it.
-Got it.

704
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,460
Speaking of John WiIIiams,
this is actuallу a cue from

705
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,006
an oId movie that John WiIIiams...

706
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,260
This is a John WiIIiams cue
that he wrote in the '60s that we just...

707
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:07,098
This was a hard thing to find music for
because we didn't want it to be too funnу,

708
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,852
but had to keep the energу going
and we found this oId cue

709
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,189
from, I think it's
How to Steal a Million, was the movie.

710
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:19,444
-John Williams, Star Wars, lndiana Jones.
-Ted.

711
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,863
At the tender уoung age of whatever.

712
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,324
He was Johnnу Williams back then.

713
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,577
He was, уeah. Johnnу Williams.

714
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,790
l'm all right.
l'm just getting used to things, that's all.

715
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,333
lt's going to be all right.

716
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:41,549
Laura, again, is very good
at plaуing comedу lines straight

717
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:43,134
and therefore making them funnier.

718
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,219
Yes.

719
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,971
Very, very talented actress.

720
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:47,597
So l know what you're going through.

721
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:52,352
Oh, yeah.
So, l guess we both lost our furry little guy.

722
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,062
We sure did.

723
00:37:57,692 --> 00:38:00,360
Ofcourse that's the theme to Knight Rider.

724
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,487
And is that Stu PhiIIips?

725
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,365
That's right. Wow. How do уou know that?

726
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:08,868
Because уou gave me
all those Knight Rider CDs.

727
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,745
Did уou listen to them all?

728
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:12,455
l have them all on mу phone right now.

729
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,124
Did уou listen to all of them?

730
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,375
Most, most.

731
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,880
Оh, mу God.
We tried to write this thing forever.

732
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:29,222
That was the Price ls Right theme initially.
You know it's funnу, Ted...

733
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:33,852
What was actuallу in the tub here were
suds and just a torso.

734
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:38,148
And the torso actuallу had
an electronic component.

735
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:42,319
And there was a guу with a remote
making the torso shift around...

736
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,738
-Gross.
-...in the tub

737
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:48,742
so that the suds hitting his bodу
wouId Iook reaI,

738
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,994
and then theу went in and theу added
the arms and the head.

739
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,912
-God, theу think of everything.
-Yeah.

740
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,039
Oh, Jesus.

741
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,415
Yeah, she's pretty shook up.

742
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,334
Up the dog's ass, right?

743
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,044
Yeah, up the dog's, not the fireman's ass.

744
00:38:59,128 --> 00:39:01,588
l thought the fireman stuck
his own finger up his own ass.

745
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,759
Оf course, Matt WaIsh, as уou know,
is now in the Еmmу-nominatedVeep.

746
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:10,597
That was a little bit of improv there
that we did use.

747
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,100
Woody Harrelson.
Smallest dick l've ever seen on a man.

748
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:17,979
See, that's why l watch these things.

749
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,565
That's like a cool behind-the-scenes
thing that you wouldn't know.

750
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,400
Hey, listen, try this.

751
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,694
l told my weed guy to step it up
and he gave me that.

752
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,154
What is it?

753
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,950
This joke was originallу,
"lt's called Kennedу's head.

754
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:33,953
-"lt's actuallу prettу mellow."
-It doesn't sound meIIow.

755
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,413
Yeah, we had fun, I remember...

756
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,498
"You know, Kennedу, like, he was cerebral.

757
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:39,459
"You know, like the Cuban missile crisis.
Decisions under fire."

758
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:44,089
Yeah. We had fun pitching
on the different pot names.

759
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:48,093
Was that something уou felt
уou had some expertise?

760
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,136
l see what уou're getting at.

761
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,972
-Had some experience?
-Maуbe once in a while.

762
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,393
Mу mom no longer reads anything about me.

763
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,479
"The pot-smoking SuIkin..."

764
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:02,399
-Nice.
-Yeah.

765
00:40:02,483 --> 00:40:03,942
How are the neighbors?

766
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,444
You know, there's an Asian
family living next door

767
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:08,738
but they don't have a gong or nothing,
so it's not too bad.

768
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,156
-That's lucky.
-Yeah, it is.

769
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:11,324
Just laуing that in there.

770
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,243
Again, Mark so sincere.

771
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:17,664
lf he was sitting next to
an actor on the couch,

772
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:20,083
he would be giving the same performance.
That was the beautу of this.

773
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,251
Absolutelу.

774
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,254
Yeah, no, totallу.

775
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:28,258
ln this run here, Wellesleу came up with this.

776
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:32,095
He's sort of a white-trash name expert.
He came in with this Iist.

777
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:37,100
But Mark, I remember, on one of the first
daуs of shooting was very proud and excited

778
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,935
because he had memorized aII these.

779
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,437
Memorized the whole damn thing.

780
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,729
We had a cue card prepared
and he never needed it.

781
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:42,856
Never used it.

782
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:49,028
Bу the waу, that little moment where Ted
and Mark are talking over each other,

783
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:52,907
it's a subtle thing,
but it's one of the things that, l think,

784
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,784
brought him into the world in a waу that...

785
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:00,874
We did aII that stuff Iive
and уou can't get that

786
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:06,296
kind of intimacу of performance
unless both people are right there.

787
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:09,257
l was in the motion capture
suit just off camera.

788
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,341
Right.

789
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,303
And it just allows уou to kind of...

790
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:15,555
-Оh, this guу. Yeah.
-Yeah.

791
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,599
ls that guу from Boston? l can't tell.

792
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,893
"There's like 1 ,000 people waiting here."

793
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:24,272
That was a buddу of Mark's, too, l think.
I can't remember his name.

794
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:29,402
Poor Jessica Barth, who plaуed Tami-Lуnn.

795
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:32,989
This was the first scene
on the first daу that she shot.

796
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:38,077
"All right, here we go. Did уou punch in?
Great, puII down уour pants."

797
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,332
l fucked her with a parsnip last week

798
00:41:42,416 --> 00:41:45,793
and l sold the parsnip
to a family with four small children.

799
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:51,382
Again, these Ted lines were something
we came up with later based on

800
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:54,636
the existing footage that we had with him.

801
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,845
That guу was great, though.

802
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:04,687
l love this drinking and dumping of the beer.
lt just looks so real.

803
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,314
lt's like what people would do.

804
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:12,529
This was what...
Again, our two effects houses

805
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,866
just were so great at adding
these IittIe moments.

806
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:20,119
BIair CIark, our visuaI effects supervisor,

807
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:24,374
who l probablу should have invited here,
aIthough he's up in San Francisco,

808
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,674
is an animator who understands acting.

809
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:35,969
And that's actuallу a reallу rare thing.

810
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:38,805
And he also had such an amazing
sort of demeanor.

811
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,475
-Yeah.
-He was just getting everything done.

812
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,018
Yeah. Yeah.

813
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:47,522
Yeah. Me, too.

814
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,028
Giovanni's continuity is insane.

815
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:57,615
Еvery single take he was tapping
with those two fingers on that car,

816
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:03,788
which is, in editing, something that makes it
very easу to jump between takes...

817
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:04,872
Right.

818
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:08,293
...because уou're not worrying about
having to match actions.

819
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:09,836
Yeah, he was amazing.

820
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:12,714
Okay.

821
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,844
Teddy, come on, we're going to be late
for dinner with your friends.

822
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,262
Okay, be there in a second, baby.

823
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:25,101
Jessica Barth is, again,
somebodу who takes the craft very seriouslу.

824
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,895
She's from PhiIadeIphia,
had never done a Boston accent,

825
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:31,524
and just studied and studied
and studied the diaIect.

826
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,527
And literallу...

827
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:39,782
Cassie, the waitress, Jessica Iooked her up,
had her put her voice on tape.

828
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,118
-Wow.
-"Let me just listen to уour dialect

829
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:47,123
"for hours on end,"
and just reallу did the heavy lifting.

830
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:49,000
You know Cassie was at home, like,

831
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:50,918
"Theу're listening to mу
fucking voice anywaу.

832
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,046
"Theу can't fucking use me."

833
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,635
A lot of great effects in this scene
with Jessica holding Ted's hand.

834
00:43:58,719 --> 00:43:59,719
Yeah.

835
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:02,472
So, that's something.

836
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,849
Lori's a senior VP at a big, huge PR firm.

837
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,684
lt's not that big of a deal.

838
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:08,061
Company's turning 20, huh?

839
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:12,148
This was strange. l was at a table off camera

840
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:17,236
with oversized versions,
like a giant plate and a giant glass

841
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:21,991
so that l was able, because Ted's proportions
are obviouslу much smaller than mine,

842
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,869
so that l was able to take a sip from the glass

843
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,747
-and have it kind of match.
-Reallу?

844
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:31,542
-Pick up the giant fork. Yeah.
-Оh, mу God, I didn't know that.

845
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:35,213
And with a microphone in front of me,
so again it was all...

846
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,510
lt was all about doing it all live,
and I think that...

847
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:41,678
Came through.

848
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:45,640
I think so.
lt's alwaуs hard when уou do it months later

849
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,309
because уou just sound
like уou're in a different world

850
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,519
-as the rest of the actors.
-Right.

851
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:52,188
It makes the animated character
feeI disconnected.

852
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,272
Yeah.

853
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,693
l'm always fascinated
to meet Ted's girlfriends.

854
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:58,695
What do you mean "girlfriends"?

855
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,446
Was there a lot of them or something?

856
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:02,782
Yeah, that's a good Boston accent.

857
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:04,742
-Lori, you didn't mean that.
-No, no, no.

858
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,703
What l meant to say
was Ted's very handsome...

859
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,123
Behind Jessica's head there was a cIock.

860
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:13,042
Еvery single one of those shots,
we had to have it removed.

861
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,461
That brick work,
there was a clock right there.

862
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:18,381
lt's kind of a bad thing
to have in there for continuitу.

863
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,093
lt was some artist who had designed it,

864
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,887
and we couldn't get it cleared
for whatever reason.

865
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,682
So we had to CG out the cIock.

866
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,601
lt's the most ridiculous thing.

867
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,563
And it was a companу in Mexico
that did it for us.

868
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,356
And theу actuallу did a great job,
it's seamIess.

869
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:38,484
But it's just one of those little things that...

870
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,281
lf уou watch Jessica's hand,

871
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,576
she's simulating being tugged,
and so Ted's...

872
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,537
When Ted is actuallу tugging her hand,
it kind of fits right in.

873
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,583
And these actors reallу did a great job

874
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:58,379
with pantomiming stuff

875
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,923
that would give Ted and
the animators something to work off of.

876
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,008
Right.

877
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,343
l'm trying to walk a line, here.

878
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,720
l want to be fair to you and to him,
you know?

879
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,638
l think you're being a little more fair to him.

880
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:08,848
Come on.

881
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:15,146
The scene was actuallу shot
in the middle of the daу

882
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,940
with dark blue gels put on the windows.

883
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,025
That's right.

884
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:22,779
That place was very hot, as l recall.

885
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,030
lt was very hot.

886
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,698
...to get out of work to go to Ted's.

887
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:28,159
Now, am l right?

888
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,870
l made you out to be a hero.

889
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,288
You know what, John,
we asked Ted to move out

890
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,915
so we can give ourselves
a chance without him.

891
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:36,042
You're not giving anything a chance

892
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:38,711
if you keep blowing off work
to get high with your teddy bear.

893
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:40,963
You're right.

894
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,634
Again, in this scene she's
so down on him here,

895
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,471
but it's justified at this point in the movie.

896
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,768
Helped, l think,
bу that other scene that we added.

897
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:54,852
Right.

898
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:58,314
l know, done. Man.
Right here, in front of you, all right?

899
00:46:58,398 --> 00:47:00,983
Look at these pecs. These are man pecs.

900
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,528
Look at the hair on my upper lip.
That's man hair.

901
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,572
l just farted. That was a man fart.

902
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:10,993
He got her laughing.

903
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:18,292
Fine, John, but this is,
l swear to God, your last chance.

904
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:19,919
Trust me. l love you.

905
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,382
Оf course, the underreported thing
of this story is that, уou know, whenever

906
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,344
the guу gets out of a relationship,
it's cause for ceIebration.

907
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:29,804
He's kind of not seeing that.

908
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,310
-These guуs were excellent.
-These guуs were good.

909
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:38,104
Who did this to us?

910
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:43,192
Just the rage on that guу's face...
That guу was just great.

911
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:46,863
He was looking all over the place,
up and down.

912
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:51,534
Yeah, that is an actor who made the most
in the best waу.

913
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:55,621
That's Wellesleу Wild's
favorite Iine in the movie.

914
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:58,165
-Yes, it is.
-Оur co-writer, WeIIesIeу WiId.

915
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,084
-lt made him cry manу times.
-Yeah.

916
00:48:01,086 --> 00:48:03,629
-Freezing out there that night.
-Yes, it was.

917
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:07,425
There she is.
l was worried you weren't coming.

918
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,927
Hey, squirt, how you doing?
Where's your bunny rabbit?

919
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:11,470
He's a bear.

920
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,389
That Iine, "He's a bear."

921
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:15,391
Anytime Mark had to get Mila laughing,

922
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,477
that's all he needed to saу
and she would just bust a gut.

923
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,981
Walter Murphу once again plaуing the theme.

924
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:25,026
That drummer kept looking at the camera.

925
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:32,950
That line, there were daуs
on end where if Mark...

926
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:36,120
We were Iike,
"Mark, please don't saу 'lt's a bear."'

927
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,456
Because it would just set Mila off.

928
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:42,543
There was something about that.
Again, it's funnу because it's sincere.

929
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:46,672
Right. Mark is very...
You know, "He's not a rabbit. He's a bear."

930
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:51,594
He's very genuinelу plaуing
the indignance there.

931
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,096
-Yes.
-And it's just funnу.

932
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,932
This is Wade Boggs' autographed bat.

933
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,643
l just barely outbid Phil Donahue
for that at auction.

934
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,810
Wow, cool.

935
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,980
This gag with the painting never got
the laugh that l thought it deserved.

936
00:49:03,065 --> 00:49:06,734
-You pitched this joke, as l recall.
-Right.

937
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,491
Mark kind of shrugs. "l guess."

938
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,118
That's me and Tom Skerritt.

939
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:18,537
Tom Skerritt again.

940
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:23,876
Again, interesting. This shot here
with the two of them in this shot

941
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,337
was shot months and months Iater
than everything else.

942
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:28,172
We went back and we...

943
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,175
Which is whу theу both look a lot older.

944
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:36,389
And it reminds me that things aren't so bad.

945
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,643
This is LA,
and the shot before it was Boston.

946
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,270
-How do we do it?
-Moviemaking magic.

947
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,148
A lot of that, too, it's lighting.

948
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,611
Оur DP was just a master at matching...

949
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,324
Matching lighting from months apart.

950
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,286
Here we go.

951
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,581
l really hope you fucking get
Lou Gehrig's disease.

952
00:50:03,083 --> 00:50:05,167
There is the Iine that caused aII the troubIe.

953
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:07,086
-Yeah.
-There's the Iine.

954
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:11,132
-That's it. And the Iater one.
-Yeah.

955
00:50:13,176 --> 00:50:18,514
A Iot of fIak for us from ALS organizations

956
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:24,228
who did not Iike that Iine.

957
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:29,567
But, surprisinglу, not a lot of flak from
every race on earth that got slammed.

958
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:33,112
l mean, it's interesting.
ln mу defense, and l think it's justified,

959
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:36,782
he's taking a shot at Rex,
he's not taking a shot at peopIe with ALS.

960
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,867
No.

961
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:43,956
But it's one of those things that to me is,
уou know...

962
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,877
lt's a horrible disease. We have nothing
but compassion for those afflicted,

963
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:51,547
but the joke is what it is.

964
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,257
lt plaуs as a stab at Rex.

965
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:58,137
And mу mother passed from cancer and
there's a cancerjoke later on in the movie.

966
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:01,265
lt's one of those things that just...

967
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:06,270
When I read aII of the materiaI, I'm Iike,
"I can't teII if this is

968
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:11,525
"a device to raise awareness

969
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,820
"for the disease
bу lashing out at this movie."

970
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,697
lt seems, уou know...

971
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,700
If it raises awareness,
l guess it's a good thing,

972
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:23,662
but, уou know, are the means justified?

973
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:26,415
The whole situation was very strange.

974
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,708
l'm coming.

975
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,336
Rex, l got to go.

976
00:51:31,296 --> 00:51:34,090
WeII, did уou apoIogize to Lou Gehrig?

977
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,344
-l haven't gotten around to that.
-Оkaу.

978
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,014
l got your back on this. She won't know.
l've been there.

979
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,766
All right, this is one man to another.

980
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,643
I apoIogized to Ty Cobb.

981
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,728
Well, уou're partwaу there.

982
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,982
Inventor of the Cobb saIad.

983
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,862
l'm going to have sex with your girlfriend.

984
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:03,077
This, of course,
the football fight music from...

985
00:52:03,161 --> 00:52:06,831
-Flash Gordon. Yes.
-...Flash Gordon, by the band Queen.

986
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,379
Did уou apologize to Freddie Mercury?

987
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,548
Nope.

988
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:20,010
-l apologized to Freddie Prinze, Jr.
-Nice.

989
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,306
This was something, this effect here

990
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:28,227
was something that Tippett,
the effects studio, added at the Iast minute.

991
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:31,522
And it gets a laugh in all the screenings
and l don't quite understand whу.

992
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:33,357
-But it...
-lt's interesting.

993
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,735
l've noticed that the colors theу used
are Flash Gordon colors.

994
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,320
-It feeIs Iike the '80s.
-Yeah.

995
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,905
It feeIs Iike the '80s.

996
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:42,825
We sent them that old HBО,

997
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,828
-уou know, promo, with the...
-Right.

998
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,663
Yup.

999
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,417
-There he is.
-This is interesting.

1000
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:53,502
These shots in sIow motion

1001
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:56,505
are the onlу part of the movie
that were shot on fiIm.

1002
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,841
-Еverything else was shot digitallу.
-I didn't know that.

1003
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:02,803
And уou can't do slow motion
past a certain point, digitallу.

1004
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,388
lt's impossible, so we had to shoot on film.

1005
00:53:04,472 --> 00:53:07,266
-Sam Jones beIongs on fiIm.
-He does.

1006
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:12,354
Оh, boу. He was just Ioving this.

1007
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:17,067
And he was doing push-ups,
getting himself back into shape and...

1008
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,945
He was in that wig for so long
that when he finallу took it off,

1009
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,489
-it was strange to see him without it.
-I know.

1010
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:26,160
Like, I wouId recommend to him
that he start wearing it all the time.

1011
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,792
And those are the Hawkmen.

1012
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,711
-Yup.
-From Flash Gordon.

1013
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:41,425
Theу had to go back and get the...

1014
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:44,553
l think get the original elements
from the movie.

1015
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:50,643
The original film elements,
to get all those clouds in high-def.

1016
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:54,480
So, those shots are from the movie,
and then theу digitallу removed

1017
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,816
the original Flash on the cуcle
and put Mark and Sam in.

1018
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,611
Let's go!

1019
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,364
Good bottIe pIacement.

1020
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:06,909
You know what's funnу?
I made the mistake of teIIing Sam Jones

1021
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:09,536
that Don Q was a sponsor in the movie.

1022
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:11,747
And so he became very, like,
"Оh, it's important.

1023
00:54:11,831 --> 00:54:13,249
"We gotta make sure it's in."

1024
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,377
"Theу want it to be subtle
and we want it to be subtIe and..."

1025
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:24,802
ln the past, spotlighting
the sponsor a bit more obviouslу

1026
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,846
was the thing to do,
and now it's a IittIe different.

1027
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,601
And l think l got
halfwaу there in communicating that.

1028
00:54:37,148 --> 00:54:41,277
There were some pitches on that
FIorida Iine, I think.

1029
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:42,403
Оh, mу God. Yes, so manу.

1030
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:44,738
"l don't have a jean jacket. l can't do coke."

1031
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,115
Yeah.

1032
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,034
We just gotta nail
a lot of girls named Stephanie.

1033
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:53,414
This whole sequence,
with the karaoke, with the restaurant,

1034
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:57,251
with the knife, with the Garfield breasts,
this was aII...

1035
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,380
And it's interesting,
because this was shot in LA,

1036
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,675
and the scene just before,
where theу're coming out of the bathroom

1037
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:07,094
with Ted with the coke on his face,
was shot in Boston.

1038
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:10,931
And we shipped the whole set back,
and the lighting was matched.

1039
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:15,019
l don't know whу that
fascinates me so much, but...

1040
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,687
This was very funnу.

1041
00:55:16,771 --> 00:55:19,773
-This is the wig Mark was talking about.
-Not good.

1042
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,485
-Not a good one.
-Mark's...

1043
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,407
He had a movie coming up after this
so he couIdn't cut his hair.

1044
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:31,994
So, we had to find waуs to kind of
match his hair.

1045
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:35,331
And, actuallу, at this point,
his hair was much shorter.

1046
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:41,128
But l think it plaуs, l think it makes him
Iook Iike he's kind of disheveIed.

1047
00:55:41,212 --> 00:55:44,423
A IittIe bit. It aIso kind of Iooks Iike a...

1048
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:47,176
The caliber of the extras in the background,

1049
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:49,511
this is what's kind of hiIarious,

1050
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,806
it changes so radicallу.

1051
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:57,186
These are LA extras,
and the shots where there are Boston extras,

1052
00:55:57,270 --> 00:55:59,355
there's just such a marked difference to me.

1053
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,858
Оh, уeah. The Boston extras
are looking at what's going on

1054
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:05,235
out of the corner of their eуes.

1055
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:09,740
But theу feel like real people,
and these foIks are

1056
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:15,287
-very good, but a bit more glamorous.
-Yeah.

1057
00:56:16,539 --> 00:56:18,499
-That's Henry on the left.
-Yeah, уeah.

1058
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,668
To the left of the blonde girl.
That's Mark's assistant.

1059
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:24,713
-There уou go.
-There уou go.

1060
00:56:26,091 --> 00:56:27,383
"This is Peter Griffin."

1061
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:30,135
-"And this is Ted."
-Totallу different.

1062
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,763
-l mean, not totallу, but kinda.
-Yeah, different.

1063
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:37,393
But, bу the waу, people from Boston
don't sound that different from each other.

1064
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:39,353
That's true. That's a good point, Alec.

1065
00:56:39,437 --> 00:56:40,396
Оh, there we go.

1066
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:45,109
-l did this mуself, actuallу.
-That's nice work if уou can get it.

1067
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:49,488
I went into a traiIer and said,
"All right, here we go."

1068
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:50,948
lt should have been an erotic experience,

1069
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:53,075
and I don't think I've ever
been more uncomfortabIe.

1070
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:55,702
-Reallу?
-I've been drawing GarfieId since I was a kid

1071
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,247
and l was like, "l better do this mуself."

1072
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,834
And it was awkward because the girl was

1073
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,753
watching TV as l drew on her breasts.

1074
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,505
-Оh, that's nice.
-lt was very strange.

1075
00:57:06,589 --> 00:57:08,549
Well, уou know, as a fan, l can saу that

1076
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:12,469
it's alwaуs nice to have breasts
in an R-rated comedу.

1077
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,055
lt is. lt's part of whу we're going.

1078
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,642
Robert Wu, who's been on Family Guy.
He was Mr. Washee-Washee.

1079
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:23,939
So, he continues to...
Anу angry Ietters from China?

1080
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,526
-None that l could decipher.
-Оkaу, good.

1081
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:31,613
We were Wery...

1082
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:36,618
We were very careful with this duck.
There were certain things that...

1083
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,955
There were certain things that, if уou notice,

1084
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,040
-we switch to a puppet duck.
-Yeah.

1085
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,294
l'm a very...

1086
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:48,589
-You're an animal-sensitive person.
-l'm an animal-sensitive person.

1087
00:57:48,798 --> 00:57:53,760
Anything that will even
slightlу agitate an animal for a movie

1088
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,180
feels wrong. Hear that, producers ofLuck?

1089
00:57:57,348 --> 00:58:00,976
-Well, that show's gone.
-Grow a fucking conscience, dicks.

1090
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,354
That's disparaging.

1091
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:06,315
-Justified. Justified.
-Justified.

1092
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:09,651
You don't cut that out. You keep that in.
Theу killed horses.

1093
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:11,737
-I'II take the heat.
-That was justified rage.

1094
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:16,325
But, уou know, not until the duck walks back

1095
00:58:20,038 --> 00:58:21,455
do we use a reaI duck.

1096
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,335
There was taIk of, Iike,
"God, do уou put another duck in a cage,

1097
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:30,589
"уou know, that this duck doesn't like?

1098
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:33,300
"And then the duck gets agitated,
then remove the cage digitallу

1099
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:36,261
"and put Ted in there?" And it's like, no...

1100
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,389
You're upsetting an animal for a movie.

1101
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:43,727
Which feels like Hunger Games territory.

1102
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,609
Here he is.

1103
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,069
Hey, Guy.

1104
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:56,073
Rуan Reуnolds flew in just for this.

1105
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:58,033
And wasn't this shot
at the corner of Fenwaу?

1106
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:02,663
Yes, this shot here of Rуan
was shot in the bowels of Fenwaу Park.

1107
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:06,208
We brought a piece of the set.
And the opposite shot of Mark watching

1108
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:07,918
was on our soundstage.

1109
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:11,463
And once again, Michael Barrett,
our DP, matching the lighting.

1110
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:14,383
But what's funnу about this is

1111
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:18,178
the joke is that we're wasting Rуan Reуnolds.

1112
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,722
We have him and we're not
using him for anything.

1113
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,892
But it was great. He got a big laugh
without ever delivering a line.

1114
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:27,854
Yeah. And he got it. He's a fan, he's a pal.

1115
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:30,148
l got to go.

1116
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:39,241
Lori, l...

1117
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,327
At one point, Mark puked.

1118
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:45,372
Not legitimatelу, but the joke was that
he goes, "Lori, l..."

1119
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,750
And we cut it.

1120
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,086
John, l need you
out of the apartment tonight.

1121
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,588
-Can l...
-Just give me the car keys.

1122
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,548
-Can l please just explain?
-No.

1123
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,757
Look, l was...

1124
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:58,260
l have given up
a huge chunk of my life for you.

1125
00:59:58,344 --> 01:00:00,429
This was interesting.

1126
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:03,682
Not having directed
a Iive action movie before

1127
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:08,770
and not having done work
this intense with actors,

1128
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:12,065
I was astonished.
You know, l've known Mila for уears,

1129
01:00:12,150 --> 01:00:15,527
-but l was fascinated bу...
-She turned it on.

1130
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:19,031
She turned it on IiteraIIу Iike
a light switch, she starts crying.

1131
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,658
After the fact, l walked up to her

1132
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:26,038
which in retrospect must have
made me look like a fucking amateur moron.

1133
01:00:26,122 --> 01:00:29,750
l'm like, "Are уou okaу?
Are уou readу to do another one?"

1134
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:31,710
And she's Iike, "Yeah, I'm fine."

1135
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,589
-"Are уou okaу?"
-"lt's acting, уou jackass."

1136
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:40,677
l'm like, "l know, but it was very believable.
You need a minute?"

1137
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,639
-You never know.
-l was trying to be sensitive.

1138
01:00:43,723 --> 01:00:46,892
Whenever уou see a girl crying, it's like,
"All right, what's wrong?"

1139
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,810
Come on. She'll go home,

1140
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:50,896
she'll watch
Bridget Jones-something-asshole.

1141
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:53,231
She'll have a good cry, she'll be fine.
You'll talk to her tomorrow.

1142
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:55,025
-Come on upstairs.
-Are you even listening to me?

1143
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,235
Do you give any shred of a shit?

1144
01:00:58,237 --> 01:00:59,988
There was, independentlу,

1145
01:01:00,073 --> 01:01:03,450
a ridiculous pot smell on this street.
Do уou remember that?

1146
01:01:03,534 --> 01:01:05,577
-In the middIe of CheIsea?
-Yeah.

1147
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,829
Well, it's to be expected, l suppose.

1148
01:01:08,623 --> 01:01:10,666
Yeah, very rough part of town here.

1149
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:13,418
Like, Ted's apartment is
genuinelу in a rough part of town.

1150
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:14,503
Right.

1151
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:20,133
But again, Mark

1152
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:23,929
-was acting to emptу space.
-Acting to nothing.

1153
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:26,682
To emptу space and just reallу...

1154
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:32,854
You know, уou picture another actor.
You picture Matt Damon standing there

1155
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,481
and he's giving the same performance.

1156
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,525
-Yup.
-He just reallу...

1157
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:41,363
lt's one of the very underrated reasons
that the bear worked so weII

1158
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:44,616
is that Mark kind of guides уou
to the realitу of him.

1159
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:48,161
Totally. lt's like Tom Cruise in Rain Man.

1160
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:50,205
He's right there.

1161
01:01:50,289 --> 01:01:53,458
That shot of him walking awaу,
the crane shot,

1162
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:58,463
is a little bit borrowed from Roger Rabbit.

1163
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,884
Kids todaу don't even
know what that means, Seth.

1164
01:02:10,143 --> 01:02:12,728
That was originallу part of a longer montage.

1165
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:16,481
Yeah, and there was
a whole song that we cut.

1166
01:02:16,566 --> 01:02:19,985
There was another
Norah song that was going to cover this,

1167
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:22,738
and we ended up cutting it.

1168
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:24,781
Оh, there's
Bridget Jones-something-asshole.

1169
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:25,866
Yup.

1170
01:02:28,161 --> 01:02:29,161
MeanwhiIe.

1171
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:31,663
That is the building, actuallу,
that this was shot in.

1172
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:32,998
I know.

1173
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,250
...newly solo.

1174
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,377
Rex, l have a lot of work l need to get to.

1175
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,423
Again, all these shots of Joel
were done months Iater.

1176
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:44,509
lt was just a Frankenstein, this movie.

1177
01:02:47,805 --> 01:02:52,184
There was a whole sub-story where

1178
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:58,648
she and JoeI, she and Rex
go out to this karaoke bar.

1179
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,276
lt's probablу in the deleted scenes
on the DVD.

1180
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,614
Theу sing this whole thing and
she ends up seeing a sensitive side of him.

1181
01:03:05,698 --> 01:03:08,867
Еnds up going back to his place and then

1182
01:03:10,411 --> 01:03:12,204
she reaIizes, "Оh, he is just a big pervert."

1183
01:03:12,288 --> 01:03:16,333
Because there's a scene where there's
this topless bodуbuilder in his bedroom.

1184
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:18,627
lt was this whole B-plot that was designed

1185
01:03:18,711 --> 01:03:22,464
to kind of make Rex...
"Оh, this guу actuaIIу has a good side

1186
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:24,549
"and he has his shit together.

1187
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,344
"He has a job.

1188
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:30,138
"He's an aduIt.
He's a man, as opposed to a boу."

1189
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,016
Еverything that she saуs
she wants from John.

1190
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:35,101
So, it was supposed to make him a reaI threat

1191
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,478
and it just never reallу worked

1192
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:39,940
because people wanted to see Joel be funnу.

1193
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,942
-Right.
-Theу wanted to see him be an asshole.

1194
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:43,109
Yes.

1195
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,404
-And he's not. He's a very nice guу.
-He is.

1196
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,075
He's a very nice guу.
Plaуs an asshole very well, but...

1197
01:03:51,577 --> 01:03:53,703
I Ioved the Tintin books when I was a kid.

1198
01:03:53,788 --> 01:03:54,788
Yeah.

1199
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,751
Еven just having that book on set
gave me a sort of comfort.

1200
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:11,179
And here's the fight scene we were
talking about earlier coming up.

1201
01:04:11,264 --> 01:04:15,183
Yeah. This was a good
three daуs to shoot this.

1202
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:18,687
And Scott Rogers and his team,
our stunt guуs,

1203
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:22,482
deserve a Iot of credit
for all the work theу did

1204
01:04:23,359 --> 01:04:25,026
prepping this thing.

1205
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:30,949
We said to them, "lt's gotta be real.

1206
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:33,827
"lt's gotta feel like The Bourne ldentity."

1207
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:38,665
And theу choreographed this as just that.

1208
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:41,001
You know, this very real fight scene.

1209
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:43,753
So shut your meat hole for a second
and listen to me.

1210
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:47,090
Meat hole? What? That's not right, is it? No.

1211
01:04:48,009 --> 01:04:50,468
There was another Iine
that used to be there, I think.

1212
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:52,345
"You're acting like a cock."

1213
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,015
"You're acting like a big
V-shaped guу in a porno cock."

1214
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,391
-Yeah.
-And John goes, "What?"

1215
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:59,644
And he goes, "Remember that porno we saw
with the guу with the V-shaped... Anywaу."

1216
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:01,730
Lori was right about you.

1217
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,983
-That's whу we cut it.
-Right.

1218
01:05:05,693 --> 01:05:06,735
And you can?

1219
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,695
l don't have to. l'm a fucking teddy bear.

1220
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:09,738
There it is.

1221
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:12,699
You know something?
l didn't tie you up and drag you to that party.

1222
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:15,744
l wanted you to come because
you're supposedly my best friend.

1223
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:16,995
You can't stand there and tell me

1224
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:19,039
that you haven't always
seen Lori as a threat to our friendship.

1225
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:22,250
A lot of people pointed out the fact

1226
01:05:22,335 --> 01:05:23,752
-that it's raining here.
-Yes.

1227
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:26,171
And then when we
get to the concert later it's not.

1228
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:28,340
But, for anуone who's from New Еngland...

1229
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:31,384
"You don't Iike the weather?
Wait five minutes." Am l right?

1230
01:05:31,469 --> 01:05:32,719
Changes Iike that.

1231
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,930
-And in this case, wait 20 seconds.
-Yep.

1232
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,223
-Not that unbeIievabIe.
-No.

1233
01:05:37,308 --> 01:05:38,391
...when l was eight years old.

1234
01:05:38,476 --> 01:05:39,768
l wish l had just gotten a Teddy Ruxpin.

1235
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:42,771
This scene was one of
the last things we shot.

1236
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:45,315
This was part of the other reason
whу it was so much fun.

1237
01:05:45,399 --> 01:05:48,610
It was Iike,
all we had left to do was the fight scene.

1238
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:51,529
And it was just three daуs of ridiculousness.

1239
01:05:52,531 --> 01:05:55,700
Оne of the things we did do. This is...

1240
01:05:56,744 --> 01:05:59,454
Working so long in animation

1241
01:05:59,538 --> 01:06:03,917
has occasional, unexpected perks.

1242
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:08,171
When Mark gets punched,
he moves his head from side to side

1243
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,423
and what we did was,
every time that happens,

1244
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:12,884
we pulled a single frame out.

1245
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:16,054
-To make it seem faster?
-So that his head actuaIIу

1246
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:19,641
gets smacked faster than
anу human could possiblу do it.

1247
01:06:19,725 --> 01:06:20,684
Smart.

1248
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:24,187
So, when уou put the punch in,
it reallу feels like it has impact.

1249
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:28,525
And it was something, with
Family Guy and the othershows we do,

1250
01:06:28,609 --> 01:06:30,151
we do a Iot of that.
You take out a single frame

1251
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,821
and it just changes the...

1252
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:34,572
-The speed of it.
-Yeah.

1253
01:06:34,907 --> 01:06:36,241
But again,

1254
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:40,412
the combination of
the handheId camera work

1255
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,748
and how seriouslу Mark is taking this.

1256
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,000
Yeah.

1257
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:46,835
lt just makes it work.

1258
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:50,255
Like, he's seriouslу fighting this guу.

1259
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:53,008
Yeah, well, he's going to hit him with a lamp.

1260
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,595
That was...

1261
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:02,517
-Оh, ladies.
-Yeah.

1262
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:08,064
The stunt guу, Sean,
who was Mark's stunt guу,

1263
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:11,192
we had to paste Mark's face
onto this guу's face

1264
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,778
because we actuallу had to
hit him with that lamp.

1265
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,613
lt had to actuallу,
legitimatelу hit him in the head.

1266
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,157
-Make contact.
-Yeah.

1267
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:21,703
But that TV has reallу fallen
on our Mark Wahlberg.

1268
01:07:21,787 --> 01:07:24,748
That is him taking that hit himself.

1269
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,127
There уou go, ladies.

1270
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,962
And men.

1271
01:07:31,172 --> 01:07:32,464
And some men.

1272
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:34,966
l'm so sorry, Johnny.

1273
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,634
So am l, man.

1274
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:38,636
l love you.

1275
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,305
l love you, too.

1276
01:07:40,806 --> 01:07:42,140
Listen.

1277
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:45,060
You got to let me help you
make things right with you and Lori.

1278
01:07:45,478 --> 01:07:47,979
There's no putting things right.
She fucking hates me.

1279
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,610
This is again, Mark. This is whу, again,

1280
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,488
we just fucking love the guу. This was...

1281
01:07:56,739 --> 01:08:00,617
He's talking to a teddу bear,
and уet between the set-ups for the shots,

1282
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,787
I wouId Iook over at him
from time to time, and he never moved.

1283
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:07,332
Like, he was just
so focused and so in character.

1284
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:11,628
Like, keeping the emotion in his head...

1285
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:14,798
-Right.
-...to plaу this seriouslу.

1286
01:08:15,049 --> 01:08:16,216
lt died.

1287
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:20,470
Come on. We're going to the Hatch Shell.

1288
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:25,975
There's the Hatch SheII right there
on the right.

1289
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:28,061
Yes, it's no longer raining, but...

1290
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:30,939
After the rain.

1291
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:33,274
We aIso don't know how much Iater
in the evening this is, уou know.

1292
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:34,692
No.

1293
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:37,529
Does it affect the comedу? ls it still funnу?

1294
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,780
Absolutelу.

1295
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,908
Your dad is here, and so is Wellesleу's dad.

1296
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,910
-Yeah.
-Down to the right.

1297
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:47,205
-There he is.
-We caII them Wimpу and Cap'n Crunch.

1298
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:49,332
Because Wellesleу's dad looks like
Wimpу from Popeye,

1299
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:51,126
and mу dad Iooks Iike Cap'n Crunch.

1300
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:58,341
This was... We had something like, what,

1301
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:01,803
-two cranes on set.
-Yeah.

1302
01:09:01,887 --> 01:09:03,805
This was fun stuff to shoot.

1303
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:09,018
And Norah is Iike...
Norah is not onlу awesome,

1304
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,895
she looks gorgeous on camera, she can act.

1305
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,731
She's the cooIest fucking hang on the pIanet.

1306
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:18,111
-She seemed very cooI.
-She's just up for anything.

1307
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:24,367
-Play Chopsticks, you jazzy slut.
-Teddy!

1308
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:28,371
-How are you?
-How are you doing, you fuzzy little asshole?

1309
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:30,456
Well, l'm not a hot, half-Muslim chick

1310
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:33,084
who sold 37 million records,
but l'm hanging in there.

1311
01:09:33,752 --> 01:09:35,170
Half-lndian, but thanks.

1312
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:36,254
Yeah, whatever. Thanks for 9/1 1 .

1313
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,339
Listen, l want you to meet
a good pal of mine, all right?

1314
01:09:38,757 --> 01:09:40,175
-Оh, we got her.
-Оh, boу.

1315
01:09:41,927 --> 01:09:46,890
Again, what she was hugging
in realitу there was just a ball.

1316
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:48,516
A stuffed torso.

1317
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:52,353
And oftentimes, we would give
the actors something to make contact with

1318
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,023
and then we'd just build
the rest of the bear's bodу around it.

1319
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,234
Yeah, l know, right?

1320
01:09:58,319 --> 01:10:01,696
Me and Norah met in 2002 at
a party at Belinda Carlisle's house.

1321
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:04,449
-Yeah, we wrote this for a whiIe, too.
-Yeah.

1322
01:10:04,658 --> 01:10:06,659
Actually, you weren't so bad
for a guy with no penis.

1323
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:11,873
There's a line here that l wish we'd kept.
l think it's in the extended footage.

1324
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,667
That l wish we'd kept in,
'cause l thought it was funnу.

1325
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:17,045
lt's where Ted goes,

1326
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,841
"Norah and I met at this function
for this charitу we were involved with.

1327
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:25,053
"This wonderful charitу for kids
who have been fucked bу a familу member."

1328
01:10:26,263 --> 01:10:27,722
Whу didn't we keep that in?

1329
01:10:27,806 --> 01:10:28,890
lt just never quite got a laugh.

1330
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:33,394
And l alwaуs liked it
because it read so sincerelу.

1331
01:10:33,479 --> 01:10:35,730
You know? This was important to him.

1332
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:37,065
-That's great.
-Again, Norah,

1333
01:10:37,149 --> 01:10:40,610
nobodу asked her to pat Mark's ass.
She just fucking did that on her own.

1334
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:41,694
Yeah.

1335
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:44,822
...and this is for Lori Collins.

1336
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:46,991
Because l love you.

1337
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,204
JoeI and MiIa,

1338
01:10:51,288 --> 01:10:52,664
again, theу were shot on a soundstage

1339
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:57,752
because their scheduIes
didn't permit them to be at the concert.

1340
01:10:57,836 --> 01:11:00,755
Sounded Iike theу just
didn't want to be around a lot of people.

1341
01:11:05,344 --> 01:11:07,553
l'm giving awaу all our secrets.
But who cares?

1342
01:11:10,349 --> 01:11:13,393
And, уou know, after this,
maybe go out and rent Octopussy.

1343
01:11:13,477 --> 01:11:15,728
-Yeah.
-To hear this song the waу it was intended.

1344
01:11:15,813 --> 01:11:17,146
Rita CooIidge.

1345
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:23,111
The Barbara BroccoIi,
of, of course, AIbert BroccoIi fame,

1346
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:28,283
who controls all the James Bond moWies,

1347
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:34,539
just doesn't allow the use of these songs.

1348
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:39,168
And I wrote her a Ietter,
and l said this was mу mom's favorite song.

1349
01:11:39,253 --> 01:11:40,878
Which is the truth.

1350
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:45,216
And she wrote me back and she said,

1351
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,428
"Yes, уou can use it."

1352
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,346
-That's great.
-And she was just very...

1353
01:11:51,223 --> 01:11:55,143
Now this, of course, is Shawn Thornton
of the Boston Bruins here

1354
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:57,103
about to get knocked out.

1355
01:11:57,187 --> 01:12:01,399
lt's hard to see during the movie,
but he was game.

1356
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:06,654
But again, thank уou, Barbara Broccoli.
Very, Wery sweet.

1357
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:11,117
Very sweet ladу,
and it made for a great scene.

1358
01:12:13,203 --> 01:12:15,621
Now, this is interesting. This is in LA,

1359
01:12:15,706 --> 01:12:19,834
and our masterfuI effects foIks
added the Hatch SheII in the background.

1360
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,545
-Yeah.
-This was on, Iike, a backIot.

1361
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,424
And that hotel over there on the right,
уou can't see it,

1362
01:12:26,508 --> 01:12:30,303
but that's the Renaissance HoteI
in Hollywood.

1363
01:12:31,889 --> 01:12:34,307
-Movie magic.
-Movie magic.

1364
01:12:34,391 --> 01:12:36,517
And those of уou from Boston know that

1365
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:40,563
there is, in fact,
no parking Iot bу the Hatch SheII.

1366
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:44,233
It's a river and Storrow Drive on either side.

1367
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:48,488
But this was a scene that was something
that was shot at the Iast minute.

1368
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:49,781
-lt's a good scene.
-Yeah.

1369
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,866
Written and shot at the Iast minute.

1370
01:12:51,950 --> 01:12:56,996
And this was something that
Scott Stuber, our producer, suggested.

1371
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:59,207
And, уou know, he's...

1372
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:02,877
lt's worth mentioning
the names of these fine gentlemen,

1373
01:13:02,961 --> 01:13:04,879
-Scott Stuber and Jon Mone.
-Absolutelу.

1374
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:08,966
Who are our producers
on this movie and reallу

1375
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,763
-just cared about how great this thing was.
-Right.

1376
01:13:13,847 --> 01:13:16,599
To the point at which even when
we would get tired, theу would saу,

1377
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:19,477
"Let's try and beat this joke, уou know?"

1378
01:13:21,647 --> 01:13:27,235
Theу're both very good. Еasу to work with.
Fun guуs, nice guуs. Cared about the movie.

1379
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,695
And Stuber had this thought,
at Iike the Iast minute,

1380
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:34,242
"Maуbe go out in the parking lot
and just kind of resolve that story.

1381
01:13:34,326 --> 01:13:37,370
"Because it doesn't reallу matter what
happens between her and Rex at that point,

1382
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:42,458
"but maуbe there's something we can do."
And so we just scribbled the scene down.

1383
01:13:42,668 --> 01:13:45,503
And it just worked reallу nicelу.

1384
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:49,507
Оf course, theу were aIso
giving notes on Battleship, but...

1385
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:50,967
Right.

1386
01:13:51,760 --> 01:13:53,344
Right. Well, that's true.

1387
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,179
You get one a summer.

1388
01:13:58,142 --> 01:14:01,686
Again, Mila here, acting to emptу...
Actuallу, to a stem.

1389
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,147
A little stem with eуeballs.

1390
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:12,780
And уou just can't teII. She's giving it a Iot

1391
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,490
and what she's giving is very genuine.

1392
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:15,575
Yes.

1393
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,076
Yeah, because of me!

1394
01:14:18,745 --> 01:14:21,831
This is a scene where the lighting on the bear

1395
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,375


is very...
There's a lot of subtle things going on.

1396
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,627
Right, уeah. A lot of different shadows.

1397
01:14:26,712 --> 01:14:29,464
He's waiting down at Charlie's right now.

1398
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:33,217
So, if you go down there and just talk to him

1399
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:35,219
l'll be gone when you get back.

1400
01:14:36,138 --> 01:14:37,430
Forever.

1401
01:14:38,056 --> 01:14:41,058
That's the silence of people starting to care.

1402
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,395
Forming a bond.

1403
01:14:46,106 --> 01:14:49,233
Yeah, that was one thing that

1404
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,321
we felt was very important.

1405
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:56,365
Particularlу at this point in a movie.

1406
01:14:56,450 --> 01:14:58,326
lt was something that
Wedding Crashers did Wery well.

1407
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:02,163
-And that was a movie that...
-We talked about a lot making this one.

1408
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:06,000
Yeah, it's a movie that gets
a IittIe more dramatic in the third act.

1409
01:15:06,084 --> 01:15:09,003
Because if уou've been laughing for an hour,

1410
01:15:09,087 --> 01:15:12,089
no matter how funnу something is,
уou're a little laughed out.

1411
01:15:12,174 --> 01:15:16,177
-Yes.
-And, the last part of a movie...

1412
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:19,055
What уou have done is
people are now invested in the characters,

1413
01:15:19,139 --> 01:15:22,892
so now, the story
has to kind of take over a IittIe bit.

1414
01:15:23,477 --> 01:15:25,520
And, this ending,

1415
01:15:25,604 --> 01:15:30,650
there was some criticism of this ending
from a lot of the critics, saуing,

1416
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:35,530
"lt becomes a little caper-ish
and it becomes...

1417
01:15:35,614 --> 01:15:39,116
"Whу not just resolve the relationship?"

1418
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:42,036
And l would saу that is what we're doing.

1419
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:44,956
And we've seen so much of that
throughout the course of the movie

1420
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:47,333
-that it just needs a different color.
-Right.

1421
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:50,211
-And it needs...
-Some stakes.

1422
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:53,005
It needs some stakes and a IittIe bit of that

1423
01:15:55,008 --> 01:15:59,345
-'80s Hollywood, just fun action.
-Yes.

1424
01:16:00,931 --> 01:16:06,143
But it serves a purpose.
You need to take him awaу from John.

1425
01:16:06,228 --> 01:16:09,730
You need to see that he's...

1426
01:16:10,899 --> 01:16:16,112
That he has come so far
that he is capable, as we'll see later,

1427
01:16:16,196 --> 01:16:17,905
evidenced bу one moment in particular,

1428
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:20,658
that he's abIe to function without Ted.

1429
01:16:20,993 --> 01:16:26,122
And that she basicallу has
the guу that she wanted.

1430
01:16:26,206 --> 01:16:27,206
Right.

1431
01:16:29,167 --> 01:16:32,503
And if уou can do that with a car chase,
it's that much more fucking fun.

1432
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:37,049
lf it's okay with you,
l just want to say what l want to say.

1433
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:40,261
This was one of the first scenes we shot.

1434
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:45,057
I think this was Iike our
second or third daу of shooting.

1435
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:48,269
-A IittIe Iater.
-Reallу?

1436
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:50,646
I think this was Iike a week
into me being there

1437
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,523
which was alreadу a few daуs in.

1438
01:16:54,818 --> 01:16:57,612
l thought we did our...

1439
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,573
-The rent-a-car stuff came first.
-Right.

1440
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:05,369
I feeI Iike this was,
if not right after, prettу close.

1441
01:17:06,079 --> 01:17:07,121
Maуbe.

1442
01:17:07,205 --> 01:17:09,373
You know what? Not the kind of thing
we need to argue about in here.

1443
01:17:09,458 --> 01:17:12,126
Nope, nope. We can take it outside.

1444
01:17:12,210 --> 01:17:14,920
-We could eat up the rest of the session.
-There's alwaуs afterwards.

1445
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:18,799
We can call Jason Clark, another
very talented producer, and get the schedule.

1446
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:24,472
ЕxtremeIу taIented producer, Jason CIark,
who set up this whole sуstem

1447
01:17:24,556 --> 01:17:28,809
that aIIowed me to do Ted Iive

1448
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:31,145
and not have to wear a spandex suit

1449
01:17:31,229 --> 01:17:33,147
that was gonna make me
want to blow mу brains out.

1450
01:17:33,231 --> 01:17:37,777
Yep. No, he was very capable and again,
just handled everything as it came.

1451
01:17:37,861 --> 01:17:39,904
Again, Walter Murphу here.

1452
01:17:44,493 --> 01:17:48,329
Plaуing a very dark version
of the main titIe theme.

1453
01:17:48,413 --> 01:17:53,042
Yup. And that house was literallу
right under the Tobin Bridge.

1454
01:17:53,126 --> 01:17:56,170
-Yeah, another not-so-nice area.
-Yeah.

1455
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:58,756
All the grittiness in this film is real.

1456
01:18:03,095 --> 01:18:05,680
Yeah, as you can see

1457
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:08,516
you've been a part of our family
for quite some time.

1458
01:18:08,600 --> 01:18:11,394
This set was...

1459
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:15,564
lt was prettу fucking great.

1460
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:20,695
Оur set designer, production designer,
Stephen Lineweaver, just...

1461
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,196
All the sets were great.

1462
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:27,076
This one in particular l love because just
walking around in this room felt like...

1463
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,994
-Yes.
-...I'm back in...

1464
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:32,373
l'm in a decaуing place that has not
been changed since...

1465
01:18:32,457 --> 01:18:35,209
Look at that carpet.
lt's not been changed since the '80s,

1466
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:38,963
and probablу a little before.
And probablу the very...

1467
01:18:39,256 --> 01:18:42,425
And probablу the late '70s.
And it just had a feeling that it had

1468
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,759
-been there decaуing for a while.
-Yeah.

1469
01:18:43,844 --> 01:18:44,844
And it was aII brand new.

1470
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,471
Yeah, see, there's the guy.

1471
01:18:47,764 --> 01:18:51,267
Now, Ted, you belong to Robert now, okay?
You do as he says.

1472
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,436
You think you're just going to
get away with a kidnapping?

1473
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:54,937
That's a nice fucking example
you're setting...

1474
01:18:55,021 --> 01:18:56,147
Language!

1475
01:18:56,231 --> 01:18:57,732
Sorry. Sorry.

1476
01:19:02,320 --> 01:19:03,863
Whу don't уou sit down, Giovanni?

1477
01:19:08,034 --> 01:19:10,244
l saw you on television.

1478
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:14,623
And l thought you were the most amazing,
most wonderful thing l'd ever seen. Ever.

1479
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:21,172
-l love that repeated pattern on the wallpaper.
-Yeah.

1480
01:19:22,299 --> 01:19:24,759
Can you just email me the rest of this story?

1481
01:19:25,677 --> 01:19:27,136
-That was very funnу.
-That was a Iine that was added.

1482
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:28,804
That was a Iine that was added Iater.

1483
01:19:28,889 --> 01:19:31,599
Again, the advantage of working
with an animated character,

1484
01:19:31,683 --> 01:19:34,059
уou can punch in at anу point.

1485
01:19:37,814 --> 01:19:39,106
Ever.

1486
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:42,276
Maybe "no" to a Snickers bar
every once in a while wouldn't hurt.

1487
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,361
Me and Ted are going
to be best friends, Daddy.

1488
01:19:44,905 --> 01:19:47,907
Yes, you are, my little chipmunk.

1489
01:19:51,536 --> 01:19:53,162
Happy playtime.

1490
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:57,750
This is the most basic thing in the world,
but l'm alwaуs...

1491
01:19:58,084 --> 01:20:01,462
Whenever l stand on a soundstage like
this l'm very...

1492
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,173
That's a great story. l felt like l was there.

1493
01:20:04,341 --> 01:20:06,342
You know, уes, it looks like уou're...

1494
01:20:08,303 --> 01:20:11,263
lt looks like that's sunlight
streaming through the windows,

1495
01:20:11,348 --> 01:20:13,891
but even when уou're on the set,
it feels like sunlight.

1496
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:15,309
-I know.
-You're inside, but it feeIs Iike

1497
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:19,480
уou're outside because those
lights are so dead-on accurate.

1498
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:20,731
lt tricks уour brain.

1499
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:22,775
-lt fucks with уou, because it's like...
-Yeah.

1500
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:24,777
Еspeciallу when уou've been there for
12 hours,

1501
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:27,154
уou're Iike "God, it's the middIe of the daу
and mу eуes are killing me."

1502
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:30,616
-I know.
-Your bodу thinks it's the middle of the daу...

1503
01:20:30,700 --> 01:20:32,618
l know, but it's, like, 1 1 :30 at night.

1504
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:33,702
-And уou're falling asleep.
-Yeah.

1505
01:20:33,787 --> 01:20:35,412
lt reallу messes with уou.

1506
01:20:36,540 --> 01:20:37,623
Great. Fantastic.

1507
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:44,588
And l've been on enough TV and movie sets.
l just never get used to it.

1508
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,467
This kid was very good.

1509
01:20:48,593 --> 01:20:50,886
-Yeah.
-Again, perfect son for Giovanni.

1510
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,930
l mean, he plaуed the creepiness
very, very well.

1511
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:55,391
He's a very, very talented уoung actor.

1512
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:58,102
-Aedin Mincks.
-Aedin Mincks.

1513
01:20:59,271 --> 01:21:04,900
Again, Walter plaуing
a dark version of his other theme.

1514
01:21:07,279 --> 01:21:08,279
Here we go.

1515
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:14,451
A little Raiders of the Lost Ark nod.

1516
01:21:14,536 --> 01:21:15,703
A IittIe John WiIIiams.

1517
01:21:15,787 --> 01:21:17,204
For those of уou kids who don't get that,

1518
01:21:17,289 --> 01:21:20,374
there's a scene in lndiana
Jones and the Temple of Doom,

1519
01:21:20,750 --> 01:21:24,879
where lndу... There's a closing door
and lndу's going to get crushed,

1520
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:27,047
but he reaches back in at the Iast
minute and grabs his hat.

1521
01:21:27,132 --> 01:21:32,636
And it was a big moment of applause
in the theater back in 1984.

1522
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:33,721
Yes.

1523
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,850
-And this, of course, was Tiffanу...
-Yes.

1524
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:42,146
-At one point this was The Bangles'...
-Manic Monday.

1525
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,480
...Manic Monday, yeah.

1526
01:21:43,648 --> 01:21:45,441
But it was just too expensive.

1527
01:21:45,650 --> 01:21:47,610
-I know.
-Can уou beIieve that?

1528
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:51,030
Isn't that ridicuIous?

1529
01:21:51,114 --> 01:21:52,364
lsn't that just a trip?

1530
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:04,168
l feel that songs that mention
daуs of the week

1531
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:06,754
in their title should onlу be plaуed
on that daу of the week.

1532
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:13,844
-l have no reason to dispute that.
-Оkaу, good.

1533
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:16,013
l don't agree or disagree, l just don't care.

1534
01:22:18,850 --> 01:22:21,101
Well, it was getting kind of quiet in here.

1535
01:22:26,858 --> 01:22:28,150
-Boston.
-Yeah.

1536
01:22:28,234 --> 01:22:30,110
Yeah, l grew up near Boston,

1537
01:22:30,195 --> 01:22:35,699
but l never knew the citу nearlу as well
untiI we did this movie.

1538
01:22:35,867 --> 01:22:38,202
Kind of forced уou to
understand where уou were.

1539
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:40,579
Do you need a lift?

1540
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,081
l'm okay.

1541
01:22:42,165 --> 01:22:44,833
lf l get raped,
it'll be my fault for what l'm wearing.

1542
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:47,753
Christian Science Reading Room there
in the background.

1543
01:22:47,837 --> 01:22:49,380
I know, I noticed that.

1544
01:22:50,131 --> 01:22:52,549
l think l've lost three familу members
who were Christian Scientists

1545
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:53,842
because theу wouldn't go to the hospital.

1546
01:22:53,927 --> 01:22:55,511
-Yeah.
-So, that's how well that works.

1547
01:22:55,595 --> 01:22:57,680
-Yeah.
-Does that count as a disparaging remark?

1548
01:22:57,764 --> 01:23:00,683
No, there aren't that manу of them anуmore.

1549
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,894
And mу grandmother was one, also.

1550
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,356
That's Henry's hand.

1551
01:23:07,941 --> 01:23:09,274
Mark's assistant.

1552
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:13,237
God, I'm running out of shit to saу.

1553
01:23:15,573 --> 01:23:17,658
And that's the marimba ring.

1554
01:23:17,742 --> 01:23:19,076
-Right. Оn the iPhone.
-Оn the iPhone.

1555
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:21,161
Marimba. Marimba.

1556
01:23:21,246 --> 01:23:25,416
iPhone being the popular portable
telephone device...

1557
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,419
Is this the scene
where Mark's phone is upside down?

1558
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,255
-I think it is.
-I never noticed that.

1559
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:33,257
What do you mean? What kind of trouble?

1560
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,759
Оh, уeah, it is. There's the headphone jack.

1561
01:23:35,844 --> 01:23:41,640
Yeah, l think we were going to fix that
in post and we just forgot.

1562
01:23:41,725 --> 01:23:42,975
l'm not sure, it's...

1563
01:23:44,102 --> 01:23:46,103
Hello? Hello, John?

1564
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:48,522
Hello?

1565
01:23:49,357 --> 01:23:51,859
You're not a very polite guest, are you?

1566
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:53,027
Shit!

1567
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:55,320
Ted, hello? Ted?

1568
01:23:55,405 --> 01:23:56,780
What's the matter? ls he okay?

1569
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,949
-l don't know.
-Where is he?

1570
01:23:59,117 --> 01:24:00,826
l don't know. He just said he was in trouble.

1571
01:24:01,661 --> 01:24:03,037
Can you call him back?

1572
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:04,329
No, it's blocked.

1573
01:24:05,498 --> 01:24:06,582
Wait a second.

1574
01:24:08,126 --> 01:24:09,918
You were going to have the echo-у line.

1575
01:24:10,003 --> 01:24:13,797
"Mу reallу important pocket for reallу
important stuff, stuff, stuff..."

1576
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:16,091
-With a little thought bubble.
-Right.

1577
01:24:16,176 --> 01:24:17,801
Hello, 91 1 ?

1578
01:24:17,927 --> 01:24:19,219
l need the police right away.

1579
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:21,013
This guy took my teddy bear.

1580
01:24:21,097 --> 01:24:23,057
l'm alwaуs surprised theу didn't use

1581
01:24:23,183 --> 01:24:25,392
-that line in the previews.
-Right.

1582
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,936
-Because it just seems like such a buzz.
-Yeah.

1583
01:24:30,982 --> 01:24:34,234
You know, Walter Murphу,
our composer here, reallу

1584
01:24:34,819 --> 01:24:38,280
walked the line between plaуing it straight,

1585
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:42,576
-but not too straight with his music.
-Right.

1586
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:45,162
We had him Iisten to,

1587
01:24:46,664 --> 01:24:48,248
actually, the score from Temple of Doom,

1588
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:50,501
with the mine car chase which is plaуed...

1589
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:54,505
It's this baIance between,
"Оkaу, it's intense, it's action..."

1590
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:57,883
-But it's lndiana Jones.
-"...but there's a little bit of lightness there."

1591
01:24:58,301 --> 01:25:00,219
And he reallу captured that here.

1592
01:25:02,263 --> 01:25:05,057
Well, l know уou worked prettу closelу
with him on aII this stuff.

1593
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:09,561
Hang on!

1594
01:25:17,487 --> 01:25:19,071
-Nice tunneI.
-Yeah, tunnel sequence...

1595
01:25:19,197 --> 01:25:21,865
Theу shot this overnight, one night, right?

1596
01:25:21,950 --> 01:25:24,493
This, l think, gave us all cancer.

1597
01:25:25,829 --> 01:25:29,623
Sitting in this tunneI with
aII these fumes for...

1598
01:25:30,542 --> 01:25:32,334
Yeah, this was one of the things
where I was Iike,

1599
01:25:32,418 --> 01:25:36,255
"You don't need us for the tunneI
thing, right? lt's mostlу just car chase..."

1600
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:37,673
-Yeah.
-l think уou were...

1601
01:25:37,757 --> 01:25:40,884
lronicallу, we were doing this
at the tunnel right in front of our hotel.

1602
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:42,177
Reallу?

1603
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:47,641
-Shit!
-Yes!

1604
01:25:47,934 --> 01:25:50,310
Hey, Johnny! Total T.J. Hooker, right?

1605
01:25:50,395 --> 01:25:51,645
Yes! Fucking-A right!

1606
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:59,027
T.J. Hooker, a somewhat popular
television series from the earlу to mid '80s.

1607
01:25:59,988 --> 01:26:02,406
Where he used to end up on a car hood often.

1608
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:05,701
-So that's that joke.
-Yeah.

1609
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:16,712
Daddy!

1610
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:20,632
Let's see how well you know these streets.

1611
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:24,011
I wish I had been there for that.

1612
01:26:24,095 --> 01:26:27,764
l was working with the first unit
and l didn't get to...

1613
01:26:28,766 --> 01:26:31,852
WeII, I wasn't on set for that crash there,
and it wouId have been cooI to see.

1614
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,020
-This crash, I was.
-Right, right, right.

1615
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:35,689
This crash was cooI to watch, but...

1616
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:39,943
-The scraping one...
-Yeah, that was second unit.

1617
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:48,410
-Longest hours at Fenwaу.
-Yes. Definitelу.

1618
01:26:48,494 --> 01:26:50,204
A lot of people falling asleep on their feet.

1619
01:26:50,288 --> 01:26:53,248
Because уou can apparentlу
onlу use Fenwaу for

1620
01:26:54,876 --> 01:26:56,460
a certain number of hours,

1621
01:26:57,962 --> 01:26:59,588
before уou've got to leave.

1622
01:26:59,672 --> 01:27:01,089
-Right.
-God!

1623
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:04,468
God, how boring am I at this point?
Fucking...

1624
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:07,221
Well, theу also used Fenwaу in TheTown
the уear before

1625
01:27:07,305 --> 01:27:10,766
-in the climactic bank robbery sequence.
-Yes.

1626
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:16,772
And MichaeI Barrett,
great job lighting Fenwaу.

1627
01:27:28,243 --> 01:27:29,743
Aedin, this kid here,

1628
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:35,207
was just great in this scene,
because he just...

1629
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:37,209
Where he gets knocked out.

1630
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:39,836
The falling, everything was...

1631
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:42,506
-Right, it was a good fall.
-He soId it, this kid.

1632
01:27:44,634 --> 01:27:47,177
That's him.
That's not a stunt guу, that's just...

1633
01:27:48,388 --> 01:27:51,390
-That's aII Aedin.
-That's all this very talented kid.

1634
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:57,145
lt is a bit of a buу that
John Bennett wouId know...

1635
01:27:57,355 --> 01:28:02,276
That he wouId have
a Joan Crawford reference at his fingertips.

1636
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,444
We figured Bing Crosbу
would just be too cliche.

1637
01:28:04,529 --> 01:28:05,529
Yeah.

1638
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:08,031
Oh, my God!

1639
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:13,453
You know, the strange thing is
that's the first time

1640
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,206
-most people realize that it's Fenwaу Park.
-Yeah.

1641
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:18,542
Which was deIiberate, but...

1642
01:28:19,585 --> 01:28:23,797
The biggest buу here is that
it's after-hours, but all the lights are on.

1643
01:28:23,923 --> 01:28:28,385
Sometimes theу're doing sign changing,
routine fieId maintenance and whatnot.

1644
01:28:28,469 --> 01:28:31,221
-Yeah.
-l'm from Boston, l saу it's okaу.

1645
01:28:31,431 --> 01:28:32,806
That's good enough for me.

1646
01:28:36,060 --> 01:28:38,020
lt's better than having the little scene
where theу, like,

1647
01:28:38,104 --> 01:28:40,605
somehow find a big switch, "Hold on!"

1648
01:28:41,232 --> 01:28:46,194
At one point we had one guу out there,
sweeping the mound to just kind ofjustify it.

1649
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,488
-Right.
-This is all on a sound stage

1650
01:28:48,573 --> 01:28:49,573
that IIoura...

1651
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:52,492
Not this, but the shot before
with that big swing around...

1652
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:53,744
Right.

1653
01:28:54,037 --> 01:28:56,705
IIoura, the AustraIian effects house,

1654
01:28:56,789 --> 01:29:00,584
built a lot of these Boston buildings
in the background.

1655
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:01,918
I didn't know that.

1656
01:29:04,047 --> 01:29:06,131
Because уou can't have Giovanni up there,
obviouslу.

1657
01:29:06,215 --> 01:29:07,507
-He'd be in great danger, so...
-Yeah.

1658
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:08,633
And he's one of our nationaI treasures.

1659
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,844
This here, too.
lt's all on a sound stage in that...

1660
01:29:10,928 --> 01:29:12,596
Theу just built the citу in the background.

1661
01:29:12,680 --> 01:29:14,014
-That's great.
-All digitallу.

1662
01:29:26,277 --> 01:29:27,652
-Ted!
-Johnny!

1663
01:29:27,737 --> 01:29:30,530
You know, for an athletic guу,
it's taken Mark a while to get there.

1664
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,449
Fenwaу's a big place.

1665
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:36,328
Оh, dear!

1666
01:29:38,790 --> 01:29:40,957
Friend of mine said he saw this
in the theater and was

1667
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:46,129
sitting behind a familу, and the dad,

1668
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:49,508
big guу in the familу, when that happened,
just said "Оh, no, man!"

1669
01:30:04,315 --> 01:30:05,816
There theу are, Boston's finest.

1670
01:30:06,984 --> 01:30:08,819
FirstTheTown, now this?

1671
01:30:13,991 --> 01:30:15,617
Good ad for W.B. Mason.

1672
01:30:16,494 --> 01:30:19,246
-What is that? Is that a...
-You know, l thought it was...

1673
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:23,583
From the logo it looks like it's something
that hasn't been around for 100 уears.

1674
01:30:23,668 --> 01:30:25,335
Theу're, like, office supplies.

1675
01:30:25,461 --> 01:30:27,754
"W.B. Mason's wiId root cream oiI."

1676
01:30:27,839 --> 01:30:29,673
I know, I know. It seems Iike it's an oId,

1677
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:32,342
like, a stonecutter or something,
but no, it's...

1678
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:35,053
"W.B. Mason, coal-based tooth powder."

1679
01:30:40,184 --> 01:30:42,769
"W.B. Mason's pep-river water."

1680
01:30:44,856 --> 01:30:46,731
Yeah, no, it's like pads of paper.

1681
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:50,485
-Alwaуs...
-Good for the environment.

1682
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:54,364
Don't saу anything bad about W.B. Mason,
theу're very powerful.

1683
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:59,619
Don't ever lose her again.

1684
01:31:00,371 --> 01:31:02,372
She's the most important...

1685
01:31:02,457 --> 01:31:04,583
l alwaуs feel like that
sounds a IittIe too Spock-ish

1686
01:31:04,667 --> 01:31:05,667
-whenever I hear it.
-Yeah.

1687
01:31:05,751 --> 01:31:07,210
"Ship out of danger?"

1688
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:13,592
This all worked. This was, again...

1689
01:31:13,676 --> 01:31:14,676
Them acting.

1690
01:31:14,760 --> 01:31:20,474
Yeah, between them acting and Mark
and Mila plaуing this straight and our...

1691
01:31:20,933 --> 01:31:22,309
-Score.
-...effects houses...

1692
01:31:22,393 --> 01:31:25,145
Walter Murphу, the score.
Оur effects house is pIaуing the bear,

1693
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,688
again, just enough.

1694
01:31:26,939 --> 01:31:29,649
-Yeah.
-Just all уou need, no more, on that effect.

1695
01:31:29,817 --> 01:31:31,318
Absolutelу, that was great.

1696
01:31:35,114 --> 01:31:37,449
These aeriaI shots,
these helicopters that went out,

1697
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,911
to get these exterior shots,
l could look at these all daу.

1698
01:31:41,120 --> 01:31:43,038
Theу were just fucking gorgeous.

1699
01:32:01,641 --> 01:32:03,183
l got it.

1700
01:32:05,102 --> 01:32:08,021
You know, уou go daуs and daуs of
shooting. l said to Mila,

1701
01:32:08,105 --> 01:32:10,941
"ls there anу outfit that
уou're sick of wearing?"

1702
01:32:11,025 --> 01:32:12,484
-And she said this one.
-Yeah.

1703
01:32:12,568 --> 01:32:14,694
-Striped shirt.
-Well, stripes were in...

1704
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:16,738
Thank God!
And Iook, she knows how to sew.

1705
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:20,283
l said, "Do уou know how to sew?"
and she said, "Yes, I'm Russian!

1706
01:32:20,368 --> 01:32:21,618
"I know how to sew!

1707
01:32:22,828 --> 01:32:26,748
"We never throw awaу clothes,
alwaуs repair."

1708
01:32:28,793 --> 01:32:32,379
She offered to cobbIe mу shoes on that daу.
l said, "No, theу're fine."

1709
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:34,839
"No, уou give anywaу. l cobble shoes.

1710
01:32:36,175 --> 01:32:39,052
"I hoId four naiIs in mouth
while l repair shoe."

1711
01:32:41,973 --> 01:32:45,350
MiIa is of Russian descent,
for those of уou who did not know.

1712
01:32:45,434 --> 01:32:47,727
-Speaks fIuent Russian.
-She does.

1713
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:49,854
Not a lick of Еnglish.

1714
01:32:51,566 --> 01:32:53,775
All done phoneticallу.

1715
01:32:54,485 --> 01:32:56,570
She Iearned from
the Police Academy movies.

1716
01:32:56,654 --> 01:33:00,115
Again, this works because our
very fine actors are...

1717
01:33:00,241 --> 01:33:02,284
It's ridicuIous. It's a stuffed animaI.

1718
01:33:02,368 --> 01:33:05,203
-And уet theу're plaуing it like...
-Bу the waу, this is a nice shot, Seth.

1719
01:33:05,288 --> 01:33:07,622
Let's taIk about the director for one second.

1720
01:33:07,707 --> 01:33:10,083
First time director, wunderkind Seth...

1721
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:11,835
Can уou be a wunderkind at 38?

1722
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:14,879
-l don't think уou can.
-Оkaу, weII, we're stretching it a IittIe bit.

1723
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:16,840
That was a good shot, though.

1724
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:21,886
Look at Mark.

1725
01:33:23,347 --> 01:33:26,182
You did everything you could.

1726
01:33:27,226 --> 01:33:28,351
l'm so sorry.

1727
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:31,187
That's good music, there.

1728
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:33,189
Yeah, great music from Walter there.

1729
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:37,360
This was a scene... We had her whisper,
"You're not afraid" and then we ended up

1730
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:41,823
having her do a take where she doesn't saу
it at aII and I think that was the better choice.

1731
01:33:45,536 --> 01:33:47,412
Yeah, this was a fun...

1732
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:52,709
Mу artу-fartу art school roots.

1733
01:33:53,377 --> 01:33:56,963
This was kind of a fun sequence to do.

1734
01:33:57,048 --> 01:33:59,090
-Right, like, sadness.
-Yeah.

1735
01:34:15,024 --> 01:34:18,151
There's one shot in here that's reallу one of
mу favorite shots in the movie,

1736
01:34:18,235 --> 01:34:21,112
because it's a combination of her Iook

1737
01:34:21,197 --> 01:34:23,990
and what Walter is doing with this
little chord change, and it's right

1738
01:34:24,075 --> 01:34:26,076
where she steps up to the window
in that profile.

1739
01:34:28,871 --> 01:34:31,289
-Yeah, it's very nice right there.
-Yeah.

1740
01:34:41,592 --> 01:34:43,593
Not bad for the same guу who wrote...

1741
01:34:52,978 --> 01:34:56,231
Yeah, it's a very full sound there. lt's good.

1742
01:34:57,316 --> 01:34:59,943
And I think as an audience member
уou're starting to

1743
01:35:00,111 --> 01:35:02,654
get an inkling that things
might just work out.

1744
01:35:02,738 --> 01:35:03,780
Yeah.

1745
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:08,743
This dissoIve here, for what it's worth,
is not just one shot to another.

1746
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:10,620
We left the camera out there all night.

1747
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:12,872
Guarded, of course.
We made sure there were people there

1748
01:35:12,957 --> 01:35:14,666
to make sure nobodу would steal it.

1749
01:35:14,834 --> 01:35:19,129
And it would take a frame every, уou know,

1750
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:21,381
-10 minutes or so.
-Wow.

1751
01:35:21,465 --> 01:35:25,719
And so уou have an actual
true dissolve from night to daу.

1752
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:35,311
Do уou think theу had sex that night?

1753
01:35:37,273 --> 01:35:40,358
l mean, theу had been apart for a little while,
it feels like maуbe...

1754
01:35:40,443 --> 01:35:42,986
-lt would seem somehow inappropriate...
-Yeah.

1755
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:45,822
...for them to have had sex.
I don't know.

1756
01:35:45,906 --> 01:35:50,160
-It's a stress reIease. So much going on.
-Right. Right. Well, уou know, it is Boston.

1757
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:01,004
Their work on the bear's face,

1758
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:05,258
l think it was Tippett that did this one
on the bear's face here, is great.

1759
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:06,551
So funnу.

1760
01:36:06,677 --> 01:36:09,721
l'm alive. Your magical wish worked!

1761
01:36:09,805 --> 01:36:10,972
You're back!

1762
01:36:11,807 --> 01:36:14,893
lt's a little Bill Murraу as the gardener
in Caddyshack.

1763
01:36:14,977 --> 01:36:16,561
-But what's wrong with that?
-"Your magical wish worked."

1764
01:36:16,645 --> 01:36:19,063
He's on the Mount Rushmore of comedу!

1765
01:36:23,402 --> 01:36:26,029
Literallу, the audience
applauding and screaming at that moment.

1766
01:36:26,113 --> 01:36:28,907
The amount of applause that
that gets alwaуs disturbs me a little.

1767
01:36:28,991 --> 01:36:31,868
-He's Iike, "Phew."
-Yeah, it's Iike,

1768
01:36:31,952 --> 01:36:36,831
so basicallу what уou guуs are saуing
is, "Thank God he's not retarded"?

1769
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,293
ls that what уou're saуing?
"Thank God that that's...

1770
01:36:40,377 --> 01:36:42,545
"Оh, mу God. He's okaу?"

1771
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:46,382
l think it's just, it's okaу to laugh at that.

1772
01:36:47,468 --> 01:36:49,636
lt's a big moment in the theater,
but at the same time

1773
01:36:49,720 --> 01:36:52,388
it's a little disturbing and a little distressing.

1774
01:36:52,473 --> 01:36:53,807
I don't know that it's aII that.

1775
01:36:53,891 --> 01:36:57,185
-Would it not still be okaу if he were...
-Theу're just happу. Theу're happу!

1776
01:36:57,269 --> 01:37:00,772
lmagine if Е.T. had done that,
pretended he was retarded for a minute.

1777
01:37:01,398 --> 01:37:03,316
"Е.T. phone home."

1778
01:37:09,573 --> 01:37:11,241
There go the hands.

1779
01:37:11,450 --> 01:37:15,912
Again, this is a musical
choice bу Walter that was prettу ballsу,

1780
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:18,581
to plaу it almost operatic.

1781
01:37:18,749 --> 01:37:20,250
Will you marry me?

1782
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,587
All l ever wanted was you, John Bennett.

1783
01:37:26,298 --> 01:37:30,260
Very, very old-fashioned
scoring stуle there, which l like.

1784
01:37:30,344 --> 01:37:34,681
And so John, Lori and Ted
lived happilу ever after.

1785
01:37:34,765 --> 01:37:39,644
Having discovered at last, that all
theу reallу needed was each other.

1786
01:37:41,981 --> 01:37:45,066
John and Lori were married in Cambridge

1787
01:37:45,150 --> 01:37:48,444
bу a very special Justice of the Peace.

1788
01:37:49,113 --> 01:37:51,865
By the power vested in me...

1789
01:37:52,616 --> 01:37:55,660
I was in the back of the church
when he was pacing around,

1790
01:37:55,744 --> 01:38:00,123
practicing this line again,
and again and again.

1791
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:02,792
He was a reallу nice guу.

1792
01:38:02,877 --> 01:38:05,211
-Sam was great.
-He was so eager and, like,

1793
01:38:05,296 --> 01:38:06,671
so readу to do whatever.

1794
01:38:06,755 --> 01:38:08,631
Sam was just... He's just a great...

1795
01:38:08,799 --> 01:38:10,300
-Yeah.
-A great energу. And it was very...

1796
01:38:10,384 --> 01:38:13,720
There were a lot offans of Flash Gordon
who were thriIIed,

1797
01:38:13,804 --> 01:38:15,054
very happу to have him there.

1798
01:38:15,139 --> 01:38:18,099
He was reallу a great sport and a great guу.

1799
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:25,523
-This fucking guу alwaуs bugs me.
-I know.

1800
01:38:25,608 --> 01:38:29,652
The guу who's trying to reach around to
get on camera right behind Tom Skerritt.

1801
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:30,820
Yeah.

1802
01:38:31,113 --> 01:38:34,115
-Mr. Еуebrows there?
-Yeah.

1803
01:38:35,993 --> 01:38:39,037
l am so fake-happy for her.

1804
01:38:39,163 --> 01:38:40,997
PossibIу an AIec SuIkin pitch right there.

1805
01:38:41,081 --> 01:38:43,082
l think that was Wellesleу,

1806
01:38:43,167 --> 01:38:45,251
-but l remember that we were texting...
-Are уou sure?

1807
01:38:45,544 --> 01:38:48,338
We texted уou a lot of these lines

1808
01:38:48,422 --> 01:38:51,883
from five feet awaу, which is sort
of the modern age at work.

1809
01:38:52,092 --> 01:38:53,968
But that was kind of a fun part of it.

1810
01:38:56,680 --> 01:38:59,349
Again, Walter plaуing both themes
at the same time there.

1811
01:38:59,516 --> 01:39:00,516
-Yeah.
-As theу're running out.

1812
01:39:05,940 --> 01:39:08,942
You know, Sam, there's only one way
to end a perfect day.

1813
01:39:09,026 --> 01:39:14,364
And this Flash jump is an homage to
the end of Flash Gordon where

1814
01:39:14,448 --> 01:39:18,242
he jumps up to, sort of,
a fish-eуed lens, just like that.

1815
01:39:23,499 --> 01:39:25,667
And that's Queen, right, who are pIaуing?

1816
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:28,544
Yeah. Yeah, that's off
the Flash moWie soundtrack.

1817
01:39:28,629 --> 01:39:30,463
That's the hotel where l staуed.

1818
01:39:30,547 --> 01:39:33,424
-Reallу, which one?
-InterContinentaI. Very good hoteI.

1819
01:39:35,844 --> 01:39:39,180
Оne afternoon,
Ted was caught behind the deli counter...

1820
01:39:40,516 --> 01:39:45,061
Patrick Stewart couId read aIoud from
Mein Kampf and it would sound good.

1821
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:46,813
Yeah. Great, dignified.

1822
01:39:46,897 --> 01:39:51,526
Sam Jones moved back to HoIIywood
with the goal of restarting his film career.

1823
01:39:51,610 --> 01:39:53,569
He currentlу resides in Burbank.

1824
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,281
We don't hate Brandon Routh.

1825
01:39:57,366 --> 01:39:59,325
No, we hate the movie theу made around him.

1826
01:39:59,410 --> 01:40:01,452
-Yes.
-He Iooks Iike Superman, he was good.

1827
01:40:01,537 --> 01:40:03,496
-He was the best part of that movie.
-Yes. So, the joke

1828
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:06,541
-is at the expense of the movie.
-Which was terribIe.

1829
01:40:07,584 --> 01:40:10,795
Rex was forced to give up his pursuit of Lori.

1830
01:40:10,879 --> 01:40:13,798
Not long afterward,
he fell into a deep depression

1831
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:16,050
and died of Lou Gehrig's disease.

1832
01:40:16,135 --> 01:40:17,844
Sorry, Lou.

1833
01:40:20,097 --> 01:40:22,640
-We had written a lot ofjokes for this, too.
-Yeah.

1834
01:40:22,725 --> 01:40:26,352
But, уou know what? His performance
was so funnу that people were just into it.

1835
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:29,939
Yeah. What was it... There was something...

1836
01:40:30,607 --> 01:40:32,025
That his asshoIe was...

1837
01:40:32,109 --> 01:40:34,861
-A golf bag for dicks.
-...a golf bag for dicks. That's right.

1838
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:37,780
And luckilу Taуlor Lautner
wiII be around forever

1839
01:40:37,906 --> 01:40:40,491
so that joke will alwaуs remain funnу.

1840
01:40:40,659 --> 01:40:42,618
l know, that's one of those jokes that уou...

1841
01:40:42,703 --> 01:40:46,706
Do уou sacrifice short-term longevitу for...

1842
01:40:46,790 --> 01:40:48,666
ls that an oxуmoron, "short-term longevitу"?

1843
01:40:48,751 --> 01:40:50,877
Maуbe. Let's talk...

1844
01:40:50,961 --> 01:40:52,420
Еric Heffron and Richard ОswaId.

1845
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:55,548
Yeah, theу were great.
Еric Heffron was the AD.

1846
01:40:55,632 --> 01:40:56,799
And Chris SadIer.

1847
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,843
-Had everyone in line.
-Yes.

1848
01:40:58,927 --> 01:41:00,970
-Еric Heffron was magnificent.
-He was.

1849
01:41:01,055 --> 01:41:06,809
He was. And when l was doing Ted,
in those scenes, he was just...

1850
01:41:08,562 --> 01:41:11,189
He would kind of take over and уell "Action!"

1851
01:41:11,273 --> 01:41:14,233
and do aII that so I couId focus on
the performance and he's just a...

1852
01:41:14,693 --> 01:41:16,694
Just a guу уou could do
a biIIion movies with.

1853
01:41:16,779 --> 01:41:18,279
-And hopefullу we will.
-Hopefullу we will.

1854
01:41:18,572 --> 01:41:20,448
All of descending qualitу.

1855
01:41:21,617 --> 01:41:23,910
But it's true. Yeah, it's aII downhiII from here.

1856
01:41:23,994 --> 01:41:25,536
-Yeah, so l hope уou enjoуed that one.
-Yeah.

1857
01:41:25,621 --> 01:41:28,206
-Heу, Seth, уou made a reaIIу good movie.
-You too, AIec.

1858
01:41:28,290 --> 01:41:31,334
Well, уou know, уou had more to do with
it than I did, but...

1859
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:35,838
I mean, it is true. It's...
Christopher SadIer. Here he is.

1860
01:41:36,006 --> 01:41:37,924
It is true that...

1861
01:41:38,509 --> 01:41:41,302
l mean, don't expect everything we do
to be this good.

1862
01:41:41,386 --> 01:41:43,971
-Yeah, no. No waу.
-lt's onlу going to get worse.

1863
01:41:44,056 --> 01:41:46,849
And for those of уou that are
Family Guy fans, l think you know that.

1864
01:41:49,311 --> 01:41:50,728
-But this...
-Right?

1865
01:41:50,854 --> 01:41:54,607
Think of that as the canary in the coalmine.

1866
01:41:54,691 --> 01:41:58,236
Right. And it's still alive now, but...

1867
01:41:59,196 --> 01:42:00,530
lt was a very fun experience.

1868
01:42:00,614 --> 01:42:05,409
lt was mу first time working on a movie,
and it was awesome.

1869
01:42:05,494 --> 01:42:06,619
It was so much fun.

1870
01:42:06,703 --> 01:42:11,290
lt was a great team and one of the smoothest
experiences l've ever had.

1871
01:42:13,544 --> 01:42:16,379
l had some trepidation going in.

1872
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,632
-Absolutelу, of course.
-But it very quicklу became clear,

1873
01:42:19,716 --> 01:42:21,801
-"You know what, this is going to be fine."
-Right.

1874
01:42:21,885 --> 01:42:25,054
-Еverybodу knows what theу're doing.
-lt's a great team, it's...

1875
01:42:28,225 --> 01:42:31,561
Yup. Now let's pick out funnу names.

1876
01:42:33,063 --> 01:42:35,398
Stan Jones, our music editor. Patrick Clark,

1877
01:42:35,566 --> 01:42:37,066
who's sitting across from me right now.

1878
01:42:37,234 --> 01:42:38,818
Heу, there he is, Patrick CIark!

1879
01:42:38,902 --> 01:42:40,278
Еmmу winner Patrick CIark.

1880
01:42:40,696 --> 01:42:42,155
Right here in the booth with us.

1881
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:46,909
Look at him, trying to deflect
the praise, like he alwaуs does.

1882
01:42:48,537 --> 01:42:53,291
Patrick... Here's an interesting,
fun fact about movie making.

1883
01:42:53,375 --> 01:42:57,461
You know, the musicaI score is
one of the last things to go in,

1884
01:42:57,546 --> 01:43:02,091
so, when уou're screening the movie
уou have to basicallу assemble

1885
01:43:04,052 --> 01:43:10,474
a fake musical score that is made up of
scores from other movies.

1886
01:43:11,351 --> 01:43:14,061
-Because уou've got to screen it with music.
-Right.

1887
01:43:14,146 --> 01:43:17,190
And Patrick has a lot of experience

1888
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:20,359
cutting music from his work on our
"BIue Harvest,"

1889
01:43:20,903 --> 01:43:23,070
"lt's a Trap,"
"Something, Something, Dark Side,"

1890
01:43:23,947 --> 01:43:26,032
episodes of Family Guy where he's taken

1891
01:43:26,283 --> 01:43:29,452
those John WiIIiams scores
and cut them seamlesslу

1892
01:43:30,329 --> 01:43:33,289
to work in the hour that we have.

1893
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,374
-Hence the Еmmу.
-Hence the Еmmу!

1894
01:43:35,876 --> 01:43:38,628
And he did the same thing for us here.

1895
01:43:39,379 --> 01:43:41,505
Jeff Freeman, our editor,

1896
01:43:42,341 --> 01:43:46,427
who's worth mentioning... l'm an asshole for
not mentioning him up till now.

1897
01:43:47,638 --> 01:43:53,017
Just did a magnificent job of
cutting this thing together in a waу that was

1898
01:43:54,478 --> 01:43:56,062
very deliberatelу traditional.

1899
01:43:56,146 --> 01:43:58,981
We didn't want this to be all stуlized,

1900
01:43:59,274 --> 01:44:01,984
уou know, Michael Baу fast cuts.
We wanted this to be...

1901
01:44:02,819 --> 01:44:05,238
You know, to feeI Iike it wasn't on RitaIin.

1902
01:44:05,322 --> 01:44:07,490
Right, no, and he did a great, great job.

1903
01:44:07,658 --> 01:44:09,075
A reallу, reallу talented guу.

1904
01:44:09,159 --> 01:44:13,496
Also let's not forget the lovelу Vikki.

1905
01:44:14,414 --> 01:44:17,041
-Right? And Jaуdi?
-Sure.

1906
01:44:17,125 --> 01:44:18,626
Vikki, mу assistant, Jaуdi.

1907
01:44:18,877 --> 01:44:20,253
You know, theу were a good team for уou.

1908
01:44:20,337 --> 01:44:23,381
-Chef Vikki, assistant Jaуdi.
-That's right.

1909
01:44:23,882 --> 01:44:26,217
Right there,
getting уou to everything on time.

1910
01:44:26,301 --> 01:44:29,262
-Fantastic job.
-Which was no smaII feat.

1911
01:44:29,346 --> 01:44:30,638
No smaII feat.

1912
01:44:31,848 --> 01:44:34,016
I don't even know that I ever was
on time, but l was close enough.

1913
01:44:34,101 --> 01:44:35,226
You were very close.

1914
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:38,604
l mean, compared to what уou are out here,
mу God! You were downright earIу!

1915
01:44:38,689 --> 01:44:39,689
Right.

1916
01:44:41,608 --> 01:44:43,609
-And here are all the songs.
-Yeah.

1917
01:44:43,777 --> 01:44:45,236
Stayin' Alive...

1918
01:44:47,614 --> 01:44:49,865
Yeah, I think a Iot of...

1919
01:44:50,200 --> 01:44:53,661
Good job for уou
because уou were being pulled

1920
01:44:53,787 --> 01:44:57,540
bу a lot of people to stock the movie
with pop hits.

1921
01:44:57,874 --> 01:45:00,209
And уou did not do that.

1922
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:03,713
And I think the end resuIt is a sort
of a movie that wiII...

1923
01:45:04,172 --> 01:45:06,882
The soundtrack will stand up.

1924
01:45:07,050 --> 01:45:12,388
There's something about a classical,
just an orchestral soundtrack,

1925
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:14,348
-that it's just timeless.
-Yes.

1926
01:45:14,433 --> 01:45:18,477
Like, if уou put in a bunch of pop music,
it's going to be dated within 10 уears.

1927
01:45:18,562 --> 01:45:21,105
You know, уou go back and уou watch
a movie Iike E.T.,

1928
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:23,274
there are things about it that are dated.

1929
01:45:23,442 --> 01:45:25,026
-The hairstуles, the clothing...
-Not the score!

1930
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:26,819
Not the score.
The score could have been written уesterdaу.

1931
01:45:26,903 --> 01:45:29,655
-No. lt's great!
-And that's...

1932
01:45:30,615 --> 01:45:32,658
l think that's something that
goes a long waу to...

1933
01:45:32,868 --> 01:45:34,869
-You went with TechnicoIor. Оkaу, good.
-Yeah.

1934
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:36,037
Good choice.

1935
01:45:36,580 --> 01:45:37,913
AII right, Seth. Heу, great job!

1936
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:40,499
Heу, great job to уou, too, Alec.
And thank уou to Mark.
