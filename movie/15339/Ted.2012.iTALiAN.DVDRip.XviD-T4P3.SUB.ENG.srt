Oh, yeah, that was
a weird interview.

633
00:30:53,607 --> 00:30:56,883
Ed thought l was ALF,
and he kept muttering
anti-Semitic comments.

He thought ALF was
Jewish for some reason.

1206
00:55:45,327 --> 00:55:47,363
You crazy!
You crazy, man!

1207
00:55:47,727 --> 00:55:49,160
Come on, James Franco.

1208
00:55:52,167 --> 00:55:54,203
You pay for wall!

1209
00:55:54,527 --> 00:55:55,926
Move, sucker!

Hey, Guy.

What<i>'</i>s going on?

1215
00:56:30,167 --> 00:56:32,522
This is Jared.
He<i>'</i>s the guy
who beat me up.

1216

And we<i>'</i>re in love.

1217
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:36,236
Huh?

1218
00:56:36,327 --> 00:56:39,046
Turns out l<i>'</i>m gay,
or whatever.

1219
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:40,802
l had no idea.

1220
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:45,004
Hey, Jared,

another one of these.

1221
00:56:48,367 --> 00:56:49,482
SAM: How we doing, ace?

1222
00:56:49,967 --> 00:56:51,195
You coming down?

1223
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:53,119
Yeah, l don<i>'</i>t feel so good.

1224
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:56,120
Give it a couple of hours.
You<i>'</i>ll be golden, Ponyboy.

1225
00:56:56,607 --> 00:56:57,801
You want a Xanax?

1226
00:56:59,367 --> 00:57:00,482
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1227
00:57:00,567 --> 00:57:01,556
What?

1228
00:57:02,687 --> 00:57:04,279
l got to go.

1229
00:57:12,007 --> 00:57:12,996
Lori, l...

1230
00:57:14,327 --> 00:57:15,476
Lori!

1231
00:57:17,287 --> 00:57:19,482
Lori, wait, please.

1232
00:57:20,327 --> 00:57:22,079
Look, l<i>'</i>m sorry,
l messed up...

1233
00:57:22,167 --> 00:57:23,998
John, l need you

tonight.

1234
00:57:24,407 --> 00:57:25,806
Can l...
Just give me
the car keys.

1235
00:57:25,887 --> 00:57:27,684
Can l please
just explain?
No.

1236
00:57:27,847 --> 00:57:28,836
Look, l was...

1237
00:57:28,927 --> 00:57:31,236
l have given up
a huge chunk of
my life for you.

1238
00:57:31,407 --> 00:57:33,921
l was going to stop in
for like five minutes
and then Flash Gordon...

1239
00:57:34,087 --> 00:57:35,918
Just give me
the car keys.

1240
00:57:45,887 --> 00:57:47,081
Lori.

1241

Lori, please, l love you.

1242
00:58:02,207 --> 00:58:04,767
Johnny, there you are.
l had to get some air.

1243
00:58:04,847 --> 00:58:06,838
That guy from your office
is in there on the couch

1244
00:58:06,927 --> 00:58:08,997
making out with that
Van Wilder-looking guy.

1245
00:58:09,207 --> 00:58:11,118
You know what? Fuck you.
l don<i>'</i>t even
want to talk to you.

1246
00:58:11,967 --> 00:58:12,956
What?

1247
00:58:13,047 --> 00:58:15,242
Do you know
what just happened?

1248
00:58:15,327 --> 00:58:17,602
Do you have any clue?
My fucking life just ended!

1249
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:19,686
Come on.
She<i>'</i>ll go home,

1250
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:21,723
she<i>'</i>ll watch
<i>Bridget Jones-</i>
something-asshole.

1251
00:58:21,807 --> 00:58:23,957
She<i>'</i>ll have a good cry,
she<i>'</i>ll be fine.
You<i>'</i>ll talk to her tomorrow.

1252
00:58:24,047 --> 00:58:25,685
Come on upstairs.
Are you even
listening to me?

1253
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:27,803
Do you give any
shred of a shit?

1254
00:58:28,887 --> 00:58:30,605
Of course l do, Johnny.

1255
00:58:30,687 --> 00:58:32,439
<i>''</i>Thunder buddies
for life,<i>''</i> remember?

1256
00:58:32,527 --> 00:58:34,995
Jesus! Lori was right.

1257
00:58:35,087 --> 00:58:37,362
l should have
stopped hanging out
with you a long time ago.

1258
00:58:37,527 --> 00:58:39,404
l<i>'</i>m never going to
have a life
with you around.

1259
00:58:39,567 --> 00:58:41,876
l<i>'</i>m 35 years old
and l<i>'</i>m going nowhere.

1260
00:58:41,967 --> 00:58:45,277
All l do is
smoke pot and watch movies
with a teddy-fucking-bear.

1261
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:47,756
Because of that,
l just lost
the love of my life.

1262
00:58:48,527 --> 00:58:49,801
Johnny, l<i>'</i>m...

1263
00:58:49,967 --> 00:58:51,082
l<i>'</i>m sorry.

1264
00:58:51,247 --> 00:58:53,477
l gotta be on my own, Ted.
l can<i>'</i>t see you anymore.

1265
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:58,117
John, wait. Listen.

1266
00:58:58,447 --> 00:59:00,517
RECORDED TOY VOlCE:
<i>I love you!</i>

1267
00:59:57,287 --> 01:00:00,643
So, word
through the grapevine
is that you<i>'</i>re

1268
01:00:00,727 --> 01:00:01,796
newly solo.

1269
01:00:01,967 --> 01:00:03,844
Rex, l have a lot of
work l need to get to.

1270
01:00:04,167 --> 01:00:07,125
l have tickets to Norah Jones
at the Hatch Shell tonight

1271
01:00:07,207 --> 01:00:09,721
and l would love it
if you would go with me.

1272
01:00:09,967 --> 01:00:12,845
You<i>'</i>re asking me out
a week after l broke up
with somebody?

1273
01:00:13,327 --> 01:00:15,397
Look, l<i>'</i>m going to
cut the shit, here.

1274
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,476
Please.

1275
01:00:16,687 --> 01:00:19,918
This is the first time
that you<i>'</i>ve been single

1276
01:00:20,007 --> 01:00:21,440
in all the years
you<i>'</i>ve worked here.

1277
01:00:22,087 --> 01:00:24,555
Just go out with me
one time.

1278
01:00:24,647 --> 01:00:26,285
And if you<i>'</i>re miserable
and you hate it

1279
01:00:26,367 --> 01:00:30,485
then l promise
l will never even
hint at the subject again.

1280
01:00:32,007 --> 01:00:32,996
Please.

1281
01:00:33,167 --> 01:00:34,600
Rex, l don<i>'</i>t think
it<i>'</i>s smart.

1282
01:00:34,727 --> 01:00:36,763
l<i>'</i>m an asshole,
l know that.

1283
01:00:36,847 --> 01:00:38,075
lt worked for me
in high school,

1284
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:39,600
and it<i>'</i>s been
a reflex ever since.

1285
01:00:40,047 --> 01:00:42,117
Lori,
the worst that can happen

1286
01:00:42,527 --> 01:00:44,882
is that you go on
a fun, casual date

1287
01:00:44,967 --> 01:00:46,923
with a guy who
just wants a chance

1288
01:00:47,007 --> 01:00:50,363
to prove that he can be
something more than a jerk.

1289
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:52,677
Plus, you are a huge catch.

1290
01:00:52,767 --> 01:00:54,723
And it<i>'</i>s about time
someone treated you
that way.

1291
01:00:56,847 --> 01:00:58,758
(SlGHS) Fuck it. Fine.

1292
01:00:58,927 --> 01:01:01,077
Fine. lt sure as hell
beats crying myself
to sleep every night.

1293
01:01:01,167 --> 01:01:03,283
And if that means
getting you off my back,

1294
01:01:03,367 --> 01:01:04,595
well, that<i>'</i>s just a bonus.

1295
01:01:04,687 --> 01:01:06,006
l<i>'</i>ll pick you up at 8:00.

1298
01:01:16,207 --> 01:01:17,196
Go away.

1299
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:20,161

Sorry. Look, Johnny,
l know you<i>'</i>re pissed,
all right?

1303
01:01:33,887 --> 01:01:35,764
But just listen to me
for five seconds.

1304
01:01:36,007 --> 01:01:38,043
l saw Lori leaving
the apartment with Rex.

1305
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:39,116
What?

1306
01:01:39,207 --> 01:01:40,435
l<i>'</i>m serious, John.
l went over to talk to her

1307
01:01:40,527 --> 01:01:42,085
and maybe take some
of the heat off you.

1308
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:43,486
And there he was,
picking her up.

1309
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:44,841
They were going
to the Hatch Shell.

1310
01:01:45,007 --> 01:01:46,838
You<i>'</i>re fucking unbelievable,
you know that?

1311
01:01:46,927 --> 01:01:48,440
How stupid
do you think l am?

1312
01:01:48,527 --> 01:01:50,006
lf you think that by
making shit like that up

1313
01:01:50,087 --> 01:01:51,964
you<i>'</i>re going to make me
choose some kind of
loyalty to you

1314
01:01:52,047 --> 01:01:53,116
over her you<i>'</i>re out
of your fucking mind.

1315
01:01:53,207 --> 01:01:55,323
Johnny, it<i>'</i>s the truth,
l<i>'</i>m telling you.

1316
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:57,238
You know what?
Get out of here.

1317
01:01:58,127 --> 01:02:00,482

You<i>'</i>re acting like a cock.

Yes, you are.

1320
01:02:03,087 --> 01:02:04,998
So shut your meat hole
for a second
and listen to me.

1321
01:02:05,247 --> 01:02:06,680
Huh?
Meat hole? What?

1322
01:02:06,767 --> 01:02:08,200

No, it can<i>'</i>t be
that either.

you<i>'</i>re blaming me

for something that
you did to yourself.

1329
01:02:21,127 --> 01:02:22,276
Lori was right about you.

1330
01:02:22,447 --> 01:02:25,917
You cannot take
responsibility for anything
that goes on in your life.

1331
01:02:26,087 --> 01:02:27,076
Oh, and you can?

l<i>'</i>m a fucking teddy bear.

l didn<i>'</i>t tie you up and
drag you to that party.

1334
01:02:32,847 --> 01:02:35,725
l wanted you to come
because you<i>'</i>re supposedly
my best friend.

1335
01:02:35,807 --> 01:02:36,922
You can<i>'</i>t stand there
and tell me

1336
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,963
that you haven<i>'</i>t
always seen Lori as
a threat to our friendship.

1337
01:02:39,047 --> 01:02:40,366
lt works out
so much better for you

getting fucked up

Emperor Ming, here,
controlling your mind?

That<i>'</i>s your choice, John.

1343
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:50,359
And by blaming me,
you, you<i>'</i>re just

making yourself
look like a pussy.
