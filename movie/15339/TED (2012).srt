It has been said that magic vanish
- From our world a long time ago

3
00:00:39,091 --> 00:00:44,091
And through the power of wishes

4
00:00:45,092 --> 00:00:49,056
To those of who lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes

5
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:55,776
Submitted here is the story of a little boy,
and a magical Christmas wish,

6
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:58,651
that changed his life... forever.

7
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:06,744
It began in 1985,
in a town just outside Boston.

8
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:12,453
It was Christmas eve,
and all the children were in high spirits.

9
00:01:12,488 --> 00:01:17,469
That special time of year,
when Boston children gather together

10
00:01:17,503 --> 00:01:22,277
- and beat up the Jewish kids.
- Hey green bob! Get him!

11
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:30,641
But there was one child who
wasn't in such good spirits,

12
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,657
little John Bennett.

13
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:37,794
That one boy in every neighbourhood,
who just has a tough time making friends.

14
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:39,551
Hey guys, can I play?

15
00:01:39,586 --> 00:01:42,094
- Get out of here Benet!
- Get lost Benet!

16
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:44,473
- Get out of here Benet.
- Yeah Benet, get lost.

17
00:01:47,092 --> 00:01:53,425
John longed with all his heart, for that
one true friend that he could call his own

18
00:01:53,460 --> 00:02:00,066
and he knew that if he ever found
that friend, he would ever let him go

19
00:02:01,617 --> 00:02:06,126
well, as it does every year,
Christmas morning finally came

20
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:10,418
all of the children were opening
their gifts with holiday glee

21
00:02:17,477 --> 00:02:24,021
and for little John Benet, Christmas day
brought a very special new arrival.

22
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,400
Wow. I guess Santa played attention
to how good you were this year huh...

23
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,594
aww, merry Christmas John

24
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:38,993
"I love you"

25
00:02:39,028 --> 00:02:40,810
He talks.

26
00:02:42,417 --> 00:02:44,740
I'm going to name you Teddy.

27
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:53,521
John became instantly attached to teddy,
there was something about that bear

28
00:02:53,556 --> 00:02:59,940
that made him feel as if he finally had a friend.
with whom he could share his deepest secrets

29
00:02:59,975 --> 00:03:01,446
"I love you"

30
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,976
I love you too teddy

31
00:03:05,048 --> 00:03:09,054
you know, I wish you could really talk to me

32
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:12,740
because then we could be best
friends forever and ever

33
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:17,459
now if there’s one thing
you can be sure of,

34
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:22,031
it’s that nothing is more powerful
than a young boys wish

35
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:24,899
except an apache helicopter...
an apache helicopter

36
00:03:24,934 --> 00:03:28,469
has machine guns and missiles

37
00:03:28,504 --> 00:03:32,292
it is an unbelievably impressive
complement of weaponry.

38
00:03:32,293 --> 00:03:34,904
An absolute death machine

39
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:41,029
Well, as it turned out, John had picked
a perfect night to make a wish.

40
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:19,850
Teddy...

41
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:25,280
Teddy?

42
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:30,972
Teddy?

43
00:04:39,334 --> 00:04:40,464
Hug me.

44
00:04:41,381 --> 00:04:43,557
You're my best friend John.

45
00:04:43,592 --> 00:04:46,677
Did you... did you just talk...

46
00:04:46,712 --> 00:04:50,017
don’t look so surprised, you’re the one
who wished for it aren’t you?

47
00:04:50,052 --> 00:04:51,971
Yeah...

48
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:54,828
I did wish for it.

49
00:04:54,863 --> 00:04:56,505
Well, here I am...

50
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:59,843
you mean... we get to
be best friends for real?

51
00:04:59,878 --> 00:05:01,301
for... real.

52
00:05:01,336 --> 00:05:02,769
forever and ever?

53
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:04,367
sounds good to me

54
00:05:05,691 --> 00:05:12,551
John was just about the happiest boy in the world.
And he couldn't wait to tell everyone the good news

55
00:05:12,586 --> 00:05:15,590
mom... dad... guess what,
my teddy bears alive

56
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:18,513
really... oh isn’t that exciting...

57
00:05:18,548 --> 00:05:21,462
No mom, he's really alive.
Look.

58
00:05:21,497 --> 00:05:23,706
merry Christmas everybody

59
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,594
Jesus H Fuck...
- lets all be best friends.

60
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,374
Oh my god.

61
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,667
get away from that thing,
get over here right now.

62
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:31,814
but dad...

63
00:05:31,849 --> 00:05:33,319
Get over here!

64
00:05:33,354 --> 00:05:35,874
- Listen to your father, come here.
- Helen, get my gun.

65
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,834
Dad, no!

66
00:05:36,868 --> 00:05:38,179
Is it a hugging gun?

67
00:05:38,214 --> 00:05:39,658
Helen, get my gun and call the police

68
00:05:39,693 --> 00:05:43,314
I’m sorry Mr. Benet, I didn’t
mean to scare anybody

69
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:45,461
I just wanted john and I to be friends

70
00:05:45,497 --> 00:05:50,136
yeah dad, I made a wish last night that
teddy was alive, and my wish came true

71
00:05:51,298 --> 00:05:53,444
Oh god.

72
00:05:54,613 --> 00:05:56,557
It's a miracle.

73
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:59,899
It's a Christmas miracle.

74
00:05:59,934 --> 00:06:02,844
You're just like the baby Jesus.

75
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:10,131
well it wasn’t long before the news of
Johns little miracle was sweeping the nation

76
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:14,260
out of a Boston suburb comes, what is
without doubt the most incredible story

77
00:06:14,295 --> 00:06:18,883
a young boys stuffed animal, has
magically come to life for unknown reasons

78
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:23,460
LOOK WHAT JESUS DID!
LOOK WHAT JESUS DID!

79
00:06:23,495 --> 00:06:28,587
before long, teddy had become a
huge celebrity in his own right

80
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,446
Hello, Teddy.

81
00:06:40,810 --> 00:06:45,154
you surprise me, for some reason I
thought you were going to be taller

82
00:06:45,189 --> 00:06:47,426
I thought you were
going to be funnier.

83
00:06:51,288 --> 00:06:57,472
but for all the fame, teddy never
forgot his very best friend, John

84
00:06:58,308 --> 00:07:01,024
the thunder can’t get us, right?

85
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:04,204
nope. were thunder buddy’s.
and the thunder knows it

86
00:07:04,239 --> 00:07:06,153
were totally safe

87
00:07:06,189 --> 00:07:09,319
- Teddy.
- Yeah, John?

88
00:07:09,354 --> 00:07:12,106
do you promise that
we'll always be together?

89
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,152
I promise.

90
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:19,034
thunder buddy’s for life

91
00:07:19,746 --> 00:07:22,180
thunder buddy’s for life.

92
00:07:23,394 --> 00:07:28,500
and that was a promise that
neither one of them forgot

93
00:07:29,799 --> 00:07:32,800
so... where are John and teddy today?

94
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,068
well, let me put it this way

95
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:38,368
no matter how big a splash you make
in this world, weather you’re a

96
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:42,388
Corey Feldman, Frankie Muniz,
Justin Bibber...

97
00:07:42,423 --> 00:07:46,621
or a talking teddy bear...
eventually nobody gives a shit.

98
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:15,499
TED

99
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:26,361
Look, all I’m saying is that Boston
women are, on the whole,

100
00:10:26,396 --> 00:10:29,601
a paler uglier sort than women
from the elsewhere’s of life.

101
00:10:29,637 --> 00:10:31,787
That's bullshit... what about Lori?
she's hot.

102
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:33,876
No Lori's from Pennsylvania
that’s not a Boston girl

103
00:10:33,911 --> 00:10:34,964
there not that bad...

104
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:39,040
see, the fact that you have to say there
not that bad, means that they are that bad

105
00:10:39,075 --> 00:10:44,884
you ever hear a Boston girl have an orgasm?
oh yah, oh yah, harder harder

106
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:50,194
oh god... that was so good. now I’m going
to stuff my fucking face with pepper flan

107
00:10:52,548 --> 00:10:56,468
Jesus this is weak,
not even getting me high

108
00:10:56,503 --> 00:10:59,210
I’m going to have a talk
with my weed guy

109
00:10:59,245 --> 00:11:00,359
working for me...

110
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,833
I think it sucks, I’m going to have
a talk with him

111
00:11:01,868 --> 00:11:04,360
I don’t know you want to go to
a drug dealer with complaints

112
00:11:04,395 --> 00:11:06,120
I’ve known this guy a long time,

113
00:11:06,155 --> 00:11:07,966
I’ve known him since 9-11

114
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,111
you remember?, I was like,
aww shit 9-11, I got to get high

115
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,794
is it 9.30?
- yeah...

116
00:11:11,829 --> 00:11:13,912
shit, I got to get to work

117
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:15,452
I don’t know if I can drive

118
00:11:15,487 --> 00:11:17,801
It's ok. I'll drive you.
I feel fine.

119
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:41,510
- Fuck.
- Aww, shit.

120
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:47,170
Aww, Johnny I'm sorry man,
that car just came out of nowhere.

121
00:11:47,205 --> 00:11:49,064
Aww, god is it bad?

122
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,719
- John, may I speak with you please?
- Shit.

123
00:11:55,787 --> 00:11:57,799
it’s alright, go go go.
I’ll pull out of here

124
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:59,152
hi Thomas, how are yah

That’s my bad,

127
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,134

128
00:12:20,169 --> 00:12:22,826

129
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,900

130
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:31,414
well I.. I guess I wasn’t prepared
for a follow up question

131
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:35,395
John, all you got to
do is not fuck up

158
00:13:41,597 --> 00:13:42,979
thanks
- thanks so much.

159
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:46,331
heard you got busted...

160
00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:49,009
Jesus Guy, you look like shit man
what happened?

161
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,948
I don’t know,
I got fucking wasted last night

162
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:56,533
and my phone says I texted someone at
3.15, asking them to beat me up

163
00:13:56,568 --> 00:14:00,326
and then at 4.30 I texted the
same person saying thanks.

164
00:14:00,361 --> 00:14:02,971
- And you don’t remember it?
- No, same as last time.

165
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:05,213
It just seems kind of gay doesn’t it?

166
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:07,279
I don’t know, maybe yeah.

167
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:09,719
Do you think your part of some gay
beat up underworld?

168
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,777
Like one of those gay beat
up clubs or something?

169
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:14,956
I don’t know, I dig chicks man,
I don’t remember any of it

170
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:16,921
I was so fucked up.
I might be gay I don’t know.

171
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:18,481
do you mind covering
for me for a bit?

172
00:14:18,666 --> 00:14:20,431
I might go lay down in the John

173
00:14:20,467 --> 00:14:21,970
hey buddy’s, where’s it hanging?
- hey Alex

174
00:14:22,005 --> 00:14:23,620
what's up?
you get in the club last night?

175
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:26,849
ahh, I didn’t get in because
the bouncer was douche face

176
00:14:26,884 --> 00:14:29,037
but I make friends in the line

177
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:30,177
well that’s good I guess.

178
00:14:30,212 --> 00:14:32,539
Hey guys, anybody know a nice restaurant?

179
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,748
Like something where they give out
free bubblegum in the bathrooms.

180
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,158
For what?

181
00:14:36,193 --> 00:14:39,471
Lori and I have been dating 4 years tomorrow.
I want to take her some place really nice.

182
00:14:39,506 --> 00:14:41,517
aw, congratulations John.

183
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:45,671
You guys have been going out for 4 years?
My last relationship lasted 6 months.

184
00:14:45,706 --> 00:14:48,049
Then she farted in her sleep.
I'm like, I'm out of here man.

185
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:49,419
And I was gone before she woke up.

186
00:14:49,454 --> 00:14:51,802
wow you’re not very tolerant huh...

187
00:14:51,837 --> 00:14:53,623
Lori ever fart in front of you?

188
00:14:53,658 --> 00:14:54,819
Yeah.

189
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:57,542
- Really?
- A million times.

190
00:14:57,577 --> 00:14:59,377
You Italian?

191
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:00,473
No.

192
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:01,971
Why?

193
00:15:03,096 --> 00:15:04,531
never mind, take her to binate

194
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:08,908
John look, don’t you think after 4 years maybe
she’s hoping for something more than dinner?

195
00:15:08,943 --> 00:15:10,048
like what?

196
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,133
I don’t know. but if it were me,
I’d be expecting a proposal

197
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:17,169
oh come on, no one’s expecting
anybody to propose...

198
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:21,744
I mean marriage isn’t... I mean...
isn’t love enough? I submit love is enough

199
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:25,122
you can put the ring in her ass...
and let her fart it out?

200
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,008
so bad, but so good...

201
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:39,995
Hey by the way, don’t let me forget you and I got to
nail down a plan for the ruins game tomorrow night.

202
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:42,915
Oh no I can’t,
I'm taking Lori to dinner.

203
00:15:42,949 --> 00:15:43,928
For what?

204
00:15:43,963 --> 00:15:46,041
Well, we’ve been dating
4 years tomorrow.

205
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:47,482
Ohh... fuck me, nice.

206
00:15:47,517 --> 00:15:48,882
Let me ask you something,

207
00:15:48,883 --> 00:15:52,086
you don't think she’s going to be
expecting something big, do you?

208
00:15:52,212 --> 00:15:53,552
What... like anal?
- No...

209
00:15:53,586 --> 00:15:56,905
like a circular gold
thing on the finger.

210
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:00,930
Oh fuck that. it’s been 4 years Johnny
you and me have been together for 27 years.

211
00:16:00,965 --> 00:16:02,411
Where’s my ring?

212
00:16:02,446 --> 00:16:04,006
Huh...
where’s my ring asshole...

213
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,342
where’s my ring motherfucker?
Put it on my

214
00:16:06,475 --> 00:16:10,171
- fuzzy finger you fuck.
- Alright knock it off

215
00:16:10,206 --> 00:16:11,579
I'm just saying...

216
00:16:11,614 --> 00:16:14,002
do you think she might be expecting
me to make that kind of a move?

217
00:16:14,037 --> 00:16:15,787
no no no, I don’t think

218
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:17,815
and not only that,
it’s the wrong time

219
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:22,499
it’s a terrible idea, you got the economy,
you got the credit bubble, the supreme court

220
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:23,815
look at Haiti

221
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,197
I guess I didn’t think about that.

222
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:27,151
Well, you know, it's a factor.

223
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:32,209
- Who are you? -Flash Gordon,
quarterback, New York Jets.

224
00:16:32,244 --> 00:16:35,068
This is the American
fantasy right here.

225
00:16:35,103 --> 00:16:39,033
- A professional NFL player is called
upon to save the world. -Yeah.

226
00:16:39,068 --> 00:16:40,033
Tom Brady could do that...

227
00:16:40,067 --> 00:16:41,671
Tom Brady could do that.

228
00:16:42,432 --> 00:16:43,968
- Hey.
- Hey sweetie.

229
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:44,958
Hey, Lori.

230
00:16:44,993 --> 00:16:46,221
Hi.

231
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:49,096
- What you got there?
- turkey burgers

232
00:16:49,131 --> 00:16:52,456
oh turkey burgers, are we having
homosexuals over for dinner?

233
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:55,408
- tonight is it?
- Ha, not just you homos.

234
00:16:56,909 --> 00:16:59,708
You kind a just re-worded my joke,
but haaaa.

235
00:16:59,743 --> 00:17:02,121
how was work?
- oh it was fine

236
00:17:02,156 --> 00:17:04,053
haws your dickhead boss?

237
00:17:04,088 --> 00:17:07,237
Rex, is fine.
he only hit on me once today so,

238
00:17:07,272 --> 00:17:08,733
it’s a good thing

239
00:17:08,768 --> 00:17:10,338
hey Johnny how about a beer huh?

240
00:17:10,373 --> 00:17:12,117
oh couple of chowbukowskis...

241
00:17:12,152 --> 00:17:13,896
couple of brewstoievskis...

242
00:17:13,931 --> 00:17:15,698
maybe a mibrewstowsky?

243
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:17,373
perhaps a teddybrewski...

244
00:17:17,408 --> 00:17:18,548
that’s a good one

245
00:17:18,583 --> 00:17:21,304
I think I too want a
Martina navratilovaski

246
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,585
oh... no no no
that doesn’t work

247
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,390
Bullshit...

248
00:17:24,425 --> 00:17:26,241
that totally worked...
no, no

249
00:17:26,276 --> 00:17:28,243
yeah it does,
- it doesn’t work

250
00:17:28,278 --> 00:17:31,987
the name has to have a ski at the end of it, and you
just put brewski at the end of Martina Navratilova

251
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,013
I just thought we
were saying funny names

252
00:17:34,048 --> 00:17:37,456
No, no. It has to have ski at the end of it,
otherwise where's the challenge?

253
00:17:37,491 --> 00:17:42,318
If there’s no ski at the end of the root word,
then we'd just be idiots saying nonsense.

254
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:54,324
- Hey.
- They found the missing hikers.

255
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,936
- They did?
- Yeah. -What happened?

256
00:17:55,971 --> 00:17:56,956
they said

257
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:00,671
they got separated, and one of them had
there foot stuck under a rock for like 5 days

258
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:07,998
you know, if your leg got trapped under
a rock, id chew it off to get you free

259
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:10,325
you would?
- I sure would

260
00:18:11,402 --> 00:18:12,720
is that cannibalism?

261
00:18:12,755 --> 00:18:15,310
No, I think it’s only cannibalism
if you swallow.

262
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,470
Oh yeah, don't worry about that,
'cos I don’t swallow.

263
00:18:18,505 --> 00:18:20,441
Really? 'cos that's not what I heard.

264
00:18:20,477 --> 00:18:23,104
well it’s not true ok,
I’m a classy broad

265
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:24,682
yeah

266
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:26,118
I can see that

267
00:18:26,153 --> 00:18:31,204
umm, listen, speaking of classy
chow belles a really expensive restaurant

268
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:36,197
so we can go anywhere else tomorrow.
I really don’t care as long as were together

269
00:18:36,232 --> 00:18:37,944
are you kidding me?

270
00:18:37,979 --> 00:18:42,475
no, 4 years we've been going out...
I’m taking you to the best place in town

271
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,812
I love you

272
00:18:44,847 --> 00:18:47,537
I love you too.
- and your nasty

273
00:18:47,572 --> 00:18:50,018
you want to get nasty?

274
00:18:50,053 --> 00:18:51,357
nasty girl

275
00:18:57,507 --> 00:19:00,955
I don’t understand... 35 years old and
your still scared of a little thunder

276
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,369
I am not

277
00:19:04,885 --> 00:19:06,758
thunder buddy’s for life right Johnny
- fucking right.

278
00:19:06,793 --> 00:19:07,593
alright

279
00:19:07,627 --> 00:19:08,934
come on lets sing
the thunder song

280
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:12,417
when you hear the sound of thunder
don’t you get too scared.

281
00:19:12,452 --> 00:19:16,220
just grab your thunder buddy,
and say these magic words

282
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:19,705
fuck you thunder...
you can suck my dick,

283
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,935
you can’t get me thunder,
cos your just gods fart

284
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:30,483
hey Lori... can you set the alarm for 11 A.M?
I got allot of stuff to do tomorrow

285
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:44,733
hi Lori

286
00:19:45,026 --> 00:19:45,941
morning

287
00:19:51,851 --> 00:19:53,500
ok

288
00:19:53,535 --> 00:19:54,501
you ok there sweetheart?

289
00:19:54,536 --> 00:19:56,040
you look a little flustered

290
00:19:56,075 --> 00:19:58,673
I’m fine, I just didn’t have time for breakfast

291
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,474
and the garage was full
ohh and that’s right, my boyfriend

292
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,575
can’t sleep through a thunder storm
without his teddy bear

293
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,149
I don’t understand why you
keep putting up with him...

294
00:20:05,184 --> 00:20:08,866
yeah, the guys 35 and he’s working
for a rental car service...

295
00:20:08,901 --> 00:20:11,905
you guys, it’s not about that.
I don’t care about that

296
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,373
I’d love him if he was a janitor

297
00:20:13,408 --> 00:20:17,552
he has a huge heart
and we laugh allot

298
00:20:17,587 --> 00:20:20,781
it’s just a bonus that he’s like
the hottest guy in Boston

299
00:20:20,816 --> 00:20:23,367
I don’t know, I just wish hed
get his life together

300
00:20:23,402 --> 00:20:28,123
our life... and he can’t. and I swear
to god it is because of that bear

301
00:20:28,158 --> 00:20:31,180
you should give him an ultimatum,
it’s you or the bear

302
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,849
no, I can’t do that.
that would devastate him

303
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:37,528
besides, what...
what if he chose ted?

304
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:43,359
well hello there, sorry if I’m interrupting any
girl talk about Channing Tatum's index finger

305
00:20:43,394 --> 00:20:45,967
but Lori, I need to
see you in my office

306
00:20:46,002 --> 00:20:48,035
the thing is Rex, I have allot
of work I need to get through

307
00:20:48,071 --> 00:20:49,733
oh this is work I swear

308
00:20:50,657 --> 00:20:52,460
ugh great.

309
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,889
good luck,
- thank you

310
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,129
he’s such an asshole
- out of control...

311
00:20:59,164 --> 00:21:03,120
he’s such a sleaze. 100 bucks says
he’s showing her the diving photo

312
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,326
check this out

313
00:21:05,361 --> 00:21:08,685
it’s me on the
high school diving team

314
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,124
we dove the shit out
of the pool that year

315
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:12,982
you promised me
this was about work

316
00:21:13,017 --> 00:21:15,024
Lori... why don’t you like me?

317
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,076
I’m rich,im good looking,
my dad owns the company...

318
00:21:17,111 --> 00:21:19,158
I have a boyfriend.
I have told you this.

319
00:21:19,193 --> 00:21:21,000
yeah, the guy with the bear

320
00:21:21,035 --> 00:21:23,709
but I’m talking about a
mature relationship Lori

321
00:21:23,744 --> 00:21:27,377
if we were together, our
babies would be spectacular

322
00:21:27,412 --> 00:21:30,116
I mean, my top of the
pyramid Caucasian genes

323
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:37,655
and your splash of... dark... beautiful...
Smokey... Baltic...

324
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,897
Czech?
- goodbye Rex

325
00:21:55,028 --> 00:21:57,412
ok, that was perfect

326
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:59,409
would you like me to
wrap your leftovers?

327
00:21:59,445 --> 00:22:01,043
No, I'm good, thank you.

328
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:04,116
Actually, could you wrap just this up for me
please? I want to scare the shit out of somebody.

329
00:22:04,151 --> 00:22:05,132
Sure.

330
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,004
what are you, like 5 years old?
- yeah

331
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:09,067
but I read at a 6
year old level, so...

332
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:13,335
sir... and madam

333
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:17,188
here is your desert,
and champagne

334
00:22:18,007 --> 00:22:20,816
Ohh, crystal.

335
00:22:20,851 --> 00:22:23,395
It's a special night,
we've been dating for 4 years.

336
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:26,254
And hey, all those rich black people
can’t be wrong, right?

337
00:22:29,156 --> 00:22:31,440
doesn’t feel like 4 years does it?

338
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:33,085
no it doesn’t

339
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:39,002
you know, you had no business being out on that
dance floor. But I’m really happy that you were

340
00:22:44,785 --> 00:22:46,482
this song is so great

341
00:22:46,825 --> 00:22:48,777
oh yeah, Chris Brown
can do no wrong

342
00:22:49,844 --> 00:22:52,082
wow you can really move

343
00:22:52,117 --> 00:22:54,539
you like that huh?
check this shit out

344
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,303
oh my god

345
00:23:03,496 --> 00:23:04,688
are you ok?

346
00:23:04,723 --> 00:23:06,364
oh god, I am so sorry

347
00:23:06,399 --> 00:23:07,597
I’m fine,im fine

348
00:23:07,632 --> 00:23:10,080
Jesus I’m so sorry, I didn’t see
you it was an accident

349
00:23:10,115 --> 00:23:11,289
did you hurt your head?
- yeah

350
00:23:11,324 --> 00:23:13,114
my head hurts allot

351
00:23:13,149 --> 00:23:14,920
oh man, here,
let me get you some ice

352
00:23:19,992 --> 00:23:22,208
sorry... sorry,
does it hurt?

353
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,452
no

354
00:23:26,487 --> 00:23:28,727
it... its fine

355
00:23:30,065 --> 00:23:32,550
ok, hers a test to see how much
you actually care about me

356
00:23:33,455 --> 00:23:37,694
you remember the night after the club,
we went and had late night eggs and waffles

357
00:23:37,729 --> 00:23:41,810
till about 5 A.M, we watched a movie
on the little TV in the diner

358
00:23:41,845 --> 00:23:43,864
name that movie...

359
00:23:43,899 --> 00:23:44,975
"octopussy"

360
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:48,374
baby... gold star

361
00:23:48,409 --> 00:23:50,982
and by the way, my dancing
was not that bad

362
00:23:51,017 --> 00:23:52,056
it was pretty bad...
- I have cool moves

363
00:23:52,057 --> 00:23:54,206
yeah, and so do people
with Parkinson’s

364
00:23:54,241 --> 00:23:55,640
that’s not how I remember it

365
00:23:55,675 --> 00:23:57,337
ok how do you remember it?

366
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:29,301
alright... whatever you say

367
00:24:29,336 --> 00:24:31,995
hey, hers to 4 more years huh

368
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,846
cheers,
- you make me happy

369
00:24:35,038 --> 00:24:37,303
I know we said no gifts, but...
- we said no such thing...

370
00:24:37,338 --> 00:24:40,254
but I got you something anyway,
in clear violation of the no gift rule

371
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:41,612
we had no such rule...

372
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:44,855
Lori, I wanted to give this
to you for a long time

373
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:48,974
John...

374
00:24:54,157 --> 00:24:57,012
those are the ones you like right?
from the kiosk at the mall

375
00:24:58,212 --> 00:24:59,997
yeah...

376
00:25:01,259 --> 00:25:05,850
you know Lori, some day there’s
going to be a ring in there

377
00:25:05,885 --> 00:25:08,719
but I want to wait till I get
you something really special

378
00:25:08,754 --> 00:25:10,614
I just do have the money right now

379
00:25:11,563 --> 00:25:15,173
look, I’m only saying
this because I love you

380
00:25:15,208 --> 00:25:18,781
you’re not going to have any sort of
career if you wasting time with ted

381
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:19,749
Oh, geez. Here we go.

382
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,493
baby, please ask ted to move out
so we can move on with our lives

383
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:25,403
Lori, look he’s been my
best friend since I was 8

384
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:28,002
I was not a popular child,
you have to understand

385
00:25:28,037 --> 00:25:30,529
I had no friends before he came along

386
00:25:30,564 --> 00:25:32,746
he’s the only reason I ever
gained any fucking confidence

387
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:35,703
but your no longer 8,
your 35 years old

388
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:40,044
and unless your too blind to notice,
he’s not your only friend anymore

389
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:43,472
Can we talk about this another time and
just enjoy our anniversary dinner?

390
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:55,359
oh shit, hang on a second

391
00:25:55,394 --> 00:25:57,818
my phone fell under
the seat somewhere

392
00:25:57,853 --> 00:25:59,188
can you call it?

393
00:25:59,223 --> 00:26:00,501
yeah

394
00:26:14,215 --> 00:26:15,959
is that a new ringtone?

395
00:26:15,995 --> 00:26:17,473
oh, yeah

396
00:26:17,508 --> 00:26:20,837
what is it, cos it sounds negative

397
00:26:20,872 --> 00:26:22,780
no, no, it’s from the notebook

398
00:26:24,429 --> 00:26:28,241
this is going to take some doing I think
- ill just meet you upstairs then...

399
00:26:28,276 --> 00:26:29,803
yeah, I’ll be right there

400
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:40,339
ugh,
Lori... your home early

401
00:26:40,374 --> 00:26:42,119
what the hell is this?

402
00:26:42,154 --> 00:26:44,774
the lady’s and I were just
watching Jack and Jill

403
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:48,984

its... it’s just awful

404
00:26:49,018 --> 00:26:52,020
its unwatchable, but they're
hookers so its fine

405
00:26:52,055 --> 00:26:54,489

406
00:26:54,524 --> 00:26:58,456

terrible fathers I wish I could thank for this great night

409
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:08,234

410
00:27:08,269 --> 00:27:09,696

411
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:14,567
there’s a... a shit on my floor

412
00:27:14,602 --> 00:27:16,999
in the corner, there is a shit

413
00:27:18,097 --> 00:27:21,994

417
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,929

418
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:38,529
ha-ha, that’s my buddy Johnny,

419
00:27:38,564 --> 00:27:41,778

420
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:44,697

423
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:11,133

424
00:28:11,168 --> 00:28:14,976
oh look at this guy, I went
to new York once, in 1981

425
00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:17,253

426
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,320

delicate stage, you know

431
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,868
Lori and I just need a
little space right now

00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,785
come on, it’s not that bad

464
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,637
John, I look like something you give
a kid when you tell them grandma died

465
00:30:04,672 --> 00:30:08,893
look, I know it sucks ok but you got to make some money so
you can pay for an apartment

466
00:30:08,928 --> 00:30:10,774
I don’t want to work at a grocery store

467
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,666
yeah but you have no skills

468
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:14,588
I told you, I can
totally be a lawyer

469
00:30:14,623 --> 00:30:17,701
you get the job,
were celebrating after ok

470
00:30:17,736 --> 00:30:21,232
ahaa, and if I don’t get the job...
are we still going to smoke that pot?

471
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:22,843
probably yes

472
00:30:22,878 --> 00:30:25,168
ahaa yeah, good talk coach
alright buddy

473
00:30:25,203 --> 00:30:26,365

474
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:30,817
and don’t worry, I’ll do my very best
to get this job that I so crave

475
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:33,829
so you think you got what it takes?

476
00:30:33,864 --> 00:30:36,829
I tell you what I got...
you wife’s pussy on my breath

477
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:41,381
nobodies ever talked to
me like that before

478
00:30:41,416 --> 00:30:44,579
that’s because everyone’s mouth
is usually full of your wife's box

479
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:47,650
your hired

480
00:30:47,685 --> 00:30:49,145
Shit.

481
00:31:36,134 --> 00:31:39,041
Well, I am a former celebrity
in a minimum wage job.

482
00:31:39,042 --> 00:31:46,001
This is how the cast of different strokes feels all day, every
day. Awful, they must feel awful... the live ones must feel awful.

483
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,128
Come on, it's not that bad, okay?

484
00:31:48,163 --> 00:31:50,206
I got a shitty job and I assure you
I am quite content

485
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,522
Excuse me.

486
00:31:51,557 --> 00:31:53,248
I’m sorry to bother you but,

487
00:31:53,283 --> 00:31:57,063
my son and I couldn’t help
but admire your teddy bear

488
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:59,128

- thanks

489
00:31:59,163 --> 00:32:01,359
I’m Donny this is Robert

490
00:32:01,395 --> 00:32:04,901
I have to say, I’ve been following you
ever since I was a young boy

491
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:08,175
and eh, I remember seeing
you on the Carson show

492
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:10,096
you were just wonderful

493
00:32:10,131 --> 00:32:12,955
oh yeah, that was a weird interview

494
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:16,677
Ed thought I was Alf. and he kept
muttering anti Semitic comments.

495
00:32:16,712 --> 00:32:18,614
thought Alf was Jewish for some reason

496
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:21,455
have you ever considered selling the bear?
- what? - excuse me

497
00:32:21,490 --> 00:32:22,714
I want it

498
00:32:22,749 --> 00:32:24,969
hey... I’m not an IT
pal I’m a HE, alright

499
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:30,255
I’m sorry little guy, but my bear isn’t for sale,
see I’ve had him since I was about your age

500
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,582
he’s very very special to me

501
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:34,100
- stand up straight when
your talking to me

502
00:32:34,135 --> 00:32:35,981
why the fuck would he say that?

503
00:32:36,016 --> 00:32:38,826
sorry, you know you really shouldn’t
swear in front of children

504
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:44,416
uh look, were very interested in the bear. if you want to
make some sort of arrangement, hers my address and phone number

505
00:32:44,451 --> 00:32:46,964

506
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,239

507
00:32:48,274 --> 00:32:51,482
look, here it goes, in the really important
pocket for really important stuff

508
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:52,758
ok?
- ok

509
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:54,147

510
00:32:54,182 --> 00:32:56,156

511
00:32:56,191 --> 00:32:58,160
what the fuck...

512
00:32:58,194 --> 00:33:00,129
can you imagine what that
little shit would do to me?

513
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:05,573
I can totally see him taking you down to the basement and slowly delimbing while
Singing some creepy Victorian nursery rhyme

514
00:33:06,676 --> 00:33:09,953
"oh my little sixpence my pretty little sixpence"
- stop it

515
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,797
" I love my sixpence"
- knock it off

516
00:33:11,832 --> 00:33:16,212
stop it, fuck. why you got to take it to
that place.. you took it to a... that was real

517
00:33:16,247 --> 00:33:18,526
now it’s a real thing
- aww come on, take it easy

518
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:20,575
let’s just find a better
place to get stoned

519
00:33:43,113 --> 00:33:44,461
well I guess this is it huh?

520
00:33:44,462 --> 00:33:46,751
yeah, I guess so

521
00:33:46,786 --> 00:33:48,725
first night on your own

522
00:33:48,761 --> 00:33:51,877
yeah, first night in my
beautiful new apartment

523
00:33:51,912 --> 00:33:54,237
well it’ll be great
when its furnished

524
00:33:54,272 --> 00:33:57,819
yeah. and the guy said it aunt hardly
had no murders in it, so that’s good

525
00:33:57,854 --> 00:34:00,446
Okay, so...

526
00:34:00,481 --> 00:34:02,570
- if you need anything.
- Yeah.

527
00:34:02,605 --> 00:34:06,067
I know. don’t worry Johnny, I’ll be fine

528
00:34:06,102 --> 00:34:08,053
I know you will.

529
00:34:09,459 --> 00:34:10,837
Alright.

530
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,024
Hey, there.

531
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,548
Hey.

532
00:34:42,238 --> 00:34:44,430
Listen, umm.

533
00:34:45,601 --> 00:34:47,243
I just want to say thank you.

534
00:34:47,277 --> 00:34:50,502
I know what you did wasn't easy.

535
00:34:50,537 --> 00:34:54,046
And I just want you to know
that I love you for it.

536
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:57,972
And... I think it’s a new
beginning for our relationship.

537
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:01,955
Anything for you.

538
00:35:01,991 --> 00:35:05,087
this is all part of the new
grown up John Bennett, so

539
00:35:05,122 --> 00:35:06,645
you better get used to him

540
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,529
really...

541
00:35:09,618 --> 00:35:15,015
well... now I don’t have to be at
work for another 20 minutes

542
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:19,269
well that’s perfect,
cos I’m only going to need 1

543
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,910
you know what my favourite
thing about you is?

544
00:35:24,945 --> 00:35:29,628
even after 4 years,
you can still surprise me

545
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:37,208
and to step up and change such a huge part of
your life just to make your girlfriend happier

546
00:35:37,243 --> 00:35:40,629
I don’t know, I guess most
guys wouldn’t do that

547
00:35:40,663 --> 00:35:43,575
well most guys don’t have
you to motivate them

548
00:35:46,568 --> 00:35:49,891
I know I’m not a talking
teddy bear, but...

549
00:35:50,831 --> 00:35:53,904
at least you don’t have to make
a magical wish to get me

550
00:35:53,938 --> 00:35:55,658
how do you know?

551
00:36:08,139 --> 00:36:12,098
ohh... is that a Flash Gordon ray gun,
or are you just happy to see me?

552
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:24,724
there you go. Thank you very much, please
come again we have allot more groceries

553
00:36:31,381 --> 00:36:33,642
hey uhh, hey Ellen
- yeah?

554
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:35,363
who’s that over there?

555
00:36:36,496 --> 00:36:40,014
oh that’s the new check out girl
I don’t know her name. seems cute

556
00:36:40,049 --> 00:36:41,747
yeah. very cute

557
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:45,426
you know what I’d like to do to her?
something I call a dirty fuzzy

558
00:37:19,596 --> 00:37:21,452
ok... alright... so that’s
where well draw the line

559
00:37:25,774 --> 00:37:27,872
hey... how you holding up?

560
00:37:27,907 --> 00:37:32,102
oh I’m alright, I’m just getting
used to things that’s all

561
00:37:32,137 --> 00:37:33,703
It's going to be alright.

562
00:37:33,738 --> 00:37:36,752
I actually went through something
like this with my last boyfriend

563
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,497
really?
- yeah

564
00:37:38,532 --> 00:37:42,837
we were together for 8 months
and I really loved him

565
00:37:42,872 --> 00:37:47,485
and then he got deported back to Iran,
so I know what you’re going through

566
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:52,608
oh yeah. so I guess we both
lost our furry little guy

567
00:37:52,643 --> 00:37:54,329
we sure did

568
00:37:59,095 --> 00:38:02,731
hey ted. hey Johnny what are you doing?
want to come over and catch a buzz?

569
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:04,916
well I could probably
stop by after work

570
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:07,588
fuck that, I traded off yesterday
so I got the other shift

571
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:10,249
come on, I’m bored as crap over here.
just swing by for a bit...

572
00:38:10,284 --> 00:38:12,147
I can’t just ditch work man

573
00:38:12,184 --> 00:38:14,759
I’m trying to get my shit together and be
an adult here you know, for Lori's sake

574
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,886
Johnny, 5 minutes and
I’ll kick you out, I promise

575
00:38:16,921 --> 00:38:21,450
just come over.
I got the cheers DVD box set

576
00:38:21,485 --> 00:38:24,394
and the guy down at the store told me everybody
talks shit about each other in the interviews

577
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:26,792
you’ll kick me out in 5?

578
00:38:26,827 --> 00:38:28,136
I will kick you out in 5

579
00:38:28,171 --> 00:38:32,665
John, I’ll have to kick you out. I have so much
teddy bear paperwork to get through it is sick

580
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,311
what do I tell Thomas?

581
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:35,790
just tell him you don’t feel well

582
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:41,033
I got to cut out for a bit, Lori tried to break
up a dog fight and guess she got hurt pretty bad

583
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:42,190
oh my god

584
00:38:42,225 --> 00:38:45,721
yeah that’s the way she is. she sees
trouble and she tries to help out

585
00:38:45,722 --> 00:38:49,953
and I guess one of these dogs clamped its jaws on her
forearm, and wouldn’t let go until a fireman showed up

586
00:38:49,988 --> 00:38:51,631
and had to stick a finger in its ass

587
00:38:52,857 --> 00:38:55,420
oh Jesus
- yeah she’s pretty shook up

588
00:38:55,455 --> 00:38:57,568
up the dogs ass right...

589
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,538
yeah the dogs not the fireman’s ass

590
00:38:59,573 --> 00:39:01,404
I thought the fireman stuck
his finger up his own ass

591
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,646
I don’t think a fire fighter
would do that, I mean...

592
00:39:03,681 --> 00:39:05,836
well go go, take care of it, let me
know how she is. thank you. -Go

593
00:39:10,086 --> 00:39:13,387
woody Harrison... smallest dick
I’ve ever seen on a man

594
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:19,363
see, that’s why I watch these things. it’s like a
cool behind the scenes thing that you wouldn’t know

595
00:39:20,028 --> 00:39:22,268
oh hey, listen, try this.

596
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:25,108
I told my weed guy to step it up,
and he gave me that

597
00:39:25,143 --> 00:39:26,217
what is it?

598
00:39:26,218 --> 00:39:29,108
it’s called mind rape,
it’s actually pretty mellow

599
00:39:29,109 --> 00:39:30,318
it doesn’t sound very mellow

600
00:39:30,353 --> 00:39:32,316
well he only had 3 other batches

601
00:39:32,351 --> 00:39:35,445
uh, gorilla panic... uh,
they’re coming there coming

602
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,646
and something called
this is permanent

603
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:39,013
come on, spark it up

604
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:47,032
there you go, you got it

605
00:39:48,139 --> 00:39:50,085
ahahaha, nice

606
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:53,556
good huh? good job
- yeah

607
00:39:54,022 --> 00:39:56,865
take pride in that
- you know, this place looks great

608
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,858
aww thanks man, it’s all IKEA,
did the whole place for $47

609
00:40:00,893 --> 00:40:02,123
nice...
- yeah

610
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:03,626
how are the neighbours?

611
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:08,373
ah, you know, there’s an Asian family living next door,

family with 4 small children

646
00:41:44,937 --> 00:41:47,534

656
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:41,841

657
00:42:41,876 --> 00:42:43,532

658
00:42:43,567 --> 00:42:45,004

you know Robert and I could
give you a very good home

661
00:42:53,319 --> 00:42:57,895
you know, I’m pretty happy where I am
I just got a shitty new apartment

662
00:42:57,931 --> 00:42:59,829
I could offer you $6,000
in railroad bonds

663
00:42:59,864 --> 00:43:04,575
well you know, since I just returned
from active duty in the civil war

664
00:43:04,611 --> 00:43:06,527
that actually sounds very appealing

665
00:43:06,563 --> 00:43:10,364
oh wait, sorry that was 150 years ago
and I don’t give a shit...

666
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:12,347

for dinner with your friends

668
00:43:17,257 --> 00:43:19,071

as you can see,

669
00:43:19,106 --> 00:43:22,634
my dance card is quite full
I’m going to have to decline

670
00:43:22,669 --> 00:43:24,330
can I just get a hug?

671
00:43:25,378 --> 00:43:27,723
oh, no...
- yeah

672
00:43:27,758 --> 00:43:32,113
and it kills me to have to tell you no.
because I’m a people pleaser

673
00:43:32,148 --> 00:43:36,521
but, thank you for creeping up my night
and Jesus be with you... -ok

674
00:43:36,557 --> 00:43:37,822
in Christ

675
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,717
who was that guy?

676
00:43:40,752 --> 00:43:43,711
oh, that was Sinead O’Connor,
she don’t look so good no more

677
00:43:48,246 --> 00:43:51,453
how great is this huh?
the 4 of us out to dinner

678
00:43:51,488 --> 00:43:53,329
how long have we been saying
we were going to do...

679
00:43:53,365 --> 00:43:56,242
Lori, how you doing?
I haven’t talked to you in forever

680
00:43:56,277 --> 00:43:57,747
I’m good

681
00:43:57,782 --> 00:44:01,145
the companies having their 20th
anniversary party next week, so...

682
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:02,301
that’s something

683
00:44:02,302 --> 00:44:03,333
Lori's a senior vp at a
pretty huge P.R firm

684
00:44:03,368 --> 00:44:06,596
it’s not that big of a deal

685
00:44:06,597 --> 00:44:09,316
companies turning 20... so you can
bang it, but you can’t get it drunk

686
00:44:10,548 --> 00:44:11,824
right...

687
00:44:11,858 --> 00:44:14,657
yeah she gets it
she enjoys my humour

688
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:18,858
yeah, I mean Rex is having a house party,
I’m surprised John didn’t tell you

689
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:23,090
considering you two have seen each other
every single day since you moved out

690
00:44:23,126 --> 00:44:26,823
well you know, it’s funny cos
whenever Johnny and I hang out

691
00:44:26,858 --> 00:44:30,900
the first item on our agenda is...
what’s going on with Lori?

692
00:44:30,935 --> 00:44:34,312
so you know it’s funny that didn’t come up.
it must a have slipped through the cracks

693
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:35,835
we do, we talk about you all the time

694
00:44:35,870 --> 00:44:39,651
you remember the other day? I was saying
how great Lori's hair always looks

695
00:44:39,686 --> 00:44:43,469
oh my god it always looks so fucking great
I just want to brush it, you know

696
00:44:43,504 --> 00:44:45,503
right Johnny... I say that

697
00:44:46,852 --> 00:44:52,492
so, tammy-lynn. why don’t you tell
us a little bit about yourself

698
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:55,899
like where you from? I’m always
fascinated to meet teds girlfriends

699
00:44:55,934 --> 00:44:59,273
what do you mean girlfriends? was
there like allot of them or something?

700
00:44:59,308 --> 00:45:02,919
no... that’s not what she meant at all
right Lori?, Lori you didn’t mean that

701
00:45:02,954 --> 00:45:09,801
no, no, what I meant to say was that teds very handsome, so
I’m always interested in meeting the lady that can snatch him up

702
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,983
did you just call me a whore?
- what?

703
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:15,821

how about that honey...

704
00:45:15,856 --> 00:45:17,832

705
00:45:17,868 --> 00:45:19,895

706
00:45:19,930 --> 00:45:21,567

707
00:45:21,602 --> 00:45:22,946
I just asked you a question

708
00:45:22,981 --> 00:45:27,201
you know, you’re a fricking snob you think your
all cool cos you work at some fancy shit place

709
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:29,486

710
00:45:29,522 --> 00:45:31,883

can’t speak English

711
00:45:31,918 --> 00:45:36,776
oh fuck you. just cos your in the business world and shit,
you think everyone should suck your asshole or something?

712
00:45:36,811 --> 00:45:41,002
ok,alright. Tammy, come on honey, lets get out of here. well
go back to my place for a couple of vodka and strawberry quicks

713
00:45:41,037 --> 00:45:44,810
you know what bitch, I gave birth
once, I can kick your fucking ass

714
00:45:44,846 --> 00:45:47,947
and you better not show your face
around Quincy, you hear me? ever

715
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:50,428
I didn’t know you had a baby,
is it alive?

716
00:45:52,415 --> 00:45:53,694
what a cunt...

717
00:45:53,729 --> 00:45:55,903
I hate that word
- what?

718
00:45:55,938 --> 00:45:59,397
that word, it’s like an electric saw
slashing everything in its path

719
00:45:59,432 --> 00:46:00,469
why would you say that?

720
00:46:00,505 --> 00:46:02,602
you dint exactly stand up for me...

721
00:46:02,637 --> 00:46:05,729
I’m trying to walk a line here. i want
to be fair to you and to him, you know

722
00:46:05,765 --> 00:46:07,724
well I think your being a
little more fair to him

723
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:09,081
oh, come on...

724
00:46:09,116 --> 00:46:12,970
you know your boss called this
morning asking how my arm was

725
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:18,224
huh... -yeah because of the dog fight
that I tried to break up

726
00:46:19,437 --> 00:46:24,313
if I had to guess, id say you made up
some bullshit excuse to get out of work

727
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:26,151
to go to teds.
now...

728
00:46:26,186 --> 00:46:28,159
am I right?

729
00:46:29,239 --> 00:46:30,987
...I made you out to be a hero

730
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,667
you know what John, we asked ted to move
out, to give ourselves a chance without it

731
00:46:33,701 --> 00:46:38,123
you’re not giving anything a chance if your
blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear

732
00:46:39,265 --> 00:46:43,599
your right. I’ve been getting
stoned too much I know that

733
00:46:43,633 --> 00:46:46,471
I’ve been bumming around with ted
too much, I know that too

734
00:46:47,754 --> 00:46:50,303
you give me one more chance,
I promise I can fix it

735
00:46:50,338 --> 00:46:54,690
John, I need a man.
not a little boy with a teddy bear

736
00:46:54,725 --> 00:46:57,497
I know, done, man

737
00:46:57,531 --> 00:47:00,723
right here in front of you, look at
these pecks... these are man pecks

738
00:47:00,758 --> 00:47:03,034
look at the hair on my upper lip...
that’s man hair

739
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,452
I just farted,
that was a man fart

740
00:47:13,218 --> 00:47:14,758
fine...

741
00:47:14,793 --> 00:47:18,360
fine John, but this is,
I swear to god your last chance

742
00:47:18,395 --> 00:47:19,885
trust me, I love you

743
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,550
alright, I love you

744
00:47:21,585 --> 00:47:23,531
I love you so much.
you won’t be sorry I swear

745
00:47:24,692 --> 00:47:26,474
did you really just fart?

746
00:47:26,509 --> 00:47:28,324
yeah... but I pushed it
that way with my hand

747
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:30,728
I wonder who it’s going to hit first

748
00:47:30,763 --> 00:47:33,170
"so if I told them once, I told them a
million times, these numbers do not add up"

749
00:47:35,314 --> 00:47:37,354
who did this to us?

750
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:40,931
God damn it, I'm here on business.

751
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,275
Alright, here we go.

752
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:52,556
I’m really glad that you came
- me too

753
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:53,836
yeah?

754
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:57,652
is it ok if I kick your boss's ass? I mean that
wont effect your workplace chemistry will it?

755
00:47:57,687 --> 00:47:59,395
please play nice

756
00:47:59,431 --> 00:48:00,819

757
00:48:00,854 --> 00:48:02,503

758
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:07,504

you weren't coming

759
00:48:07,539 --> 00:48:10,144

760
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,832
- He's a bear.
- Got it.

761
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:15,495

764
00:48:32,963 --> 00:48:34,736
you guys look amazing

765
00:48:34,737 --> 00:48:36,489
little heavy on the eye makeup,
but pretty good

766
00:48:36,524 --> 00:48:39,976
you guys know Lori and Jim right?
... John

767
00:48:40,011 --> 00:48:41,444
hi

768
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:45,691
listen, why don’t John and I
go get a drink at the bar

769
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:48,926

- great, well be right back

770
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:50,026

771
00:48:51,095 --> 00:48:52,898
that’s an old sweater huh

772
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:56,771
this is Wade Boggs
autographed bat

773
00:48:56,807 --> 00:48:59,230
I just barely outbid Phil Donohue
for that at auction

774
00:48:59,265 --> 00:49:00,291
wow cool

775
00:49:00,327 --> 00:49:01,705
yeah... cool

776
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,151
these boxing gloves worn by
Joe Lewis in his first fight

777
00:49:06,027 --> 00:49:08,580
this is art, get it?

778
00:49:11,277 --> 00:49:14,167
these were John Lennon's glasses
there worth like a million dollars

779
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:17,110
that’s me and Tom Scarritt

780
00:49:17,145 --> 00:49:18,902
ohh... check this out

781
00:49:20,663 --> 00:49:22,345
that’s Lance Armstrong's nut

782
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,603
I had it freeze dried and bronzed

783
00:49:24,637 --> 00:49:31,714
every now and then, when my life’s getting me down and
things are tough. I just come up here, and I look at it

784
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:37,427
and it reminds me that...
things aren’t so bad

785
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:40,391
sometimes you feel like a nut

786
00:49:41,459 --> 00:49:43,018
sometimes you don’t

787
00:49:44,732 --> 00:49:48,363
so, talk to me Johnny quest,
how are things with you and Lori

788
00:49:48,398 --> 00:49:50,247
you know, things are great actually

789
00:49:50,281 --> 00:49:51,524
oh that’s great
that... is... great

790
00:49:54,132 --> 00:49:59,070
Lori would hate me for saying this, but
she told me how you are at the office

791
00:49:59,105 --> 00:50:04,379
and as one gentleman to another, I just want to say,
I really fucking hope you get Lou Gehrig’s disease

792
00:50:04,414 --> 00:50:09,191
wow... I think we need to clear
the air here a little

793
00:50:09,227 --> 00:50:12,557
I mean yeah, I’m kind of a fun time
boss and what not

794
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:15,230
but look man, I do that with
everybody at the office

795
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:16,381
I’m a cook

796
00:50:16,417 --> 00:50:21,099
I have no designs on your girlfriend
we work together and that’s it

797
00:50:21,134 --> 00:50:24,602
I think you're a great guy.
and she’s a very lucky girl

798
00:50:26,644 --> 00:50:28,082
well that’s good to hear

799
00:50:28,117 --> 00:50:29,239
yeah

800
00:50:31,507 --> 00:50:32,596
excuse me

801
00:50:32,631 --> 00:50:34,137
hey ted

802
00:50:34,172 --> 00:50:36,637
Johnny, were are you you got to get
over here man. why what’s going on?

803
00:50:36,673 --> 00:50:37,500
ok, so

804
00:50:37,535 --> 00:50:40,161
I’m having a little impromptu thing
with some people at my apartment

805
00:50:40,197 --> 00:50:42,559
and John... Sam Jones is here

806
00:50:42,594 --> 00:50:43,910

807
00:50:43,945 --> 00:50:46,821
Sam Jones... Flash fucking Gordon
... is here

808
00:50:46,856 --> 00:50:48,293
holy shit, what

809
00:50:48,329 --> 00:50:51,023
you remember I said my buddy’s cousin
is friends with Sam Jones?

810
00:50:51,058 --> 00:50:54,404
well my buddy’s cousin is in town,
and who do you think is with him...

811
00:50:54,439 --> 00:50:59,115
Sam Jones... Sam Jones is here and John
... his hair is parted down the middle

812
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:01,042
just like in the movie...

813
00:51:01,077 --> 00:51:03,574
Yes! Get over here right now.

814
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:07,501

815
00:51:07,536 --> 00:51:10,200
I just... I cant

816
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:16,730
John, Flash Gordon was the most important influence of our
informative years. he taught us right from wrong, good from evil

817
00:51:16,765 --> 00:51:20,198
and the word acting apparently
has an extremely broad definition

818
00:51:20,234 --> 00:51:24,812
Flash Gordon is the symbol of our
friendship John. come share this with me

819
00:51:26,298 --> 00:51:27,793
I’m coming

820

Rex, I got to go. I’ll be back
in like 30 minutes tops ok

821
00:51:32,885 --> 00:51:36,677
Lori cannot find out. she absolutely
cannot know I was gone

822
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:39,857
if you can cover for me, I’m cool
with all that other shit

823
00:51:39,892 --> 00:51:42,300
I got your back on this
she won’t know I’ve been there

824
00:51:42,335 --> 00:51:46,127

I don’t really know you, but I’m trusting

825
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:47,671

826
00:51:47,707 --> 00:51:51,952

913
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,672
you know what, fuck you,
I don’t even want to talk to you

914
01:00:40,707 --> 01:00:44,190
what...
- do you know what just happened?

915
01:00:44,226 --> 01:00:47,267
do you have any clue?
my fucking life just ended

916
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:53,818
oh come on, shell go home, shell watch Bridget Jones
some asshole, shell have a good cry. She’ll be fine.

917
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,962
you’ll talk to her tomorrow
come on upstairs

918
01:00:54,998 --> 01:00:57,967
are you even listening to me?
do you even give any thread of a shit?

919
01:00:58,003 --> 01:01:02,533
of course I do... Johnny,
thunder buddy’s for life, remember

920
01:01:02,567 --> 01:01:08,191
Jesus, Lori was right’s should a stopped
hanging out with you a long time ago

921
01:01:08,226 --> 01:01:12,702
I’m never going to have a life with you around.
I’m 35 years old and I’m going nowhere

922
01:01:12,737 --> 01:01:15,629
All I do is smoke pot and watch
movies with a teddy fucking bear.

923
01:01:15,664 --> 01:01:19,057
because of that, I just
lost the love of my life

924
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:22,865
Johnny... I... I’m sorry

925
01:01:22,901 --> 01:01:25,306
I got to be on my own ted.
I can’t see you anymore

926
01:01:26,555 --> 01:01:29,548
John, wait, listen

927
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:31,490
"I love you"

928
01:02:31,159 --> 01:02:36,231
so, word through the grapevine
is that your newly solo

929
01:02:36,232 --> 01:02:38,163
Rex, I have allot of work
I need to get to

930
01:02:38,198 --> 01:02:44,889
I have tickets to Norah Jones at the hat shell
tonight, and I would love it if you'd go with me

931
01:02:44,924 --> 01:02:47,703
your asking me out?
a week after I broke up with somebody...

932
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:50,847
look, I’m going to cut the shit here

933
01:02:50,883 --> 01:02:51,954
please

934
01:02:51,990 --> 01:02:57,039
this is the first time you've been
single in all the years you've worked here

935
01:02:57,073 --> 01:02:59,758
just... go out with me one time?

936
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:06,655
and if your miserable, and you hate it. then I
promise, I will never hint at the subject again

937
01:03:06,689 --> 01:03:08,718
please

938
01:03:08,753 --> 01:03:10,751
Rex, I don’t think it’s smart

939
01:03:10,786 --> 01:03:16,263
I’m an asshole, I know that. it worked for me
in high school. and it’s been a reflex ever since

940
01:03:16,297 --> 01:03:22,204
Lori, the worst that can happen is you
go on a fun casual date, with a guy

941
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:26,321
who just wants to prove that he
can be something more than a jerk.

942
01:03:26,356 --> 01:03:31,449
Plus you are a huge catch, and its
about time someone treated you that way

943
01:03:33,914 --> 01:03:36,216
fuck it, fine

944
01:03:36,251 --> 01:03:38,693
sure beats crying myself to
sleep every night

945
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:41,523
and if that means getting you
off my back, well that’s just a bonus

946
01:03:41,559 --> 01:03:43,111
I'll pick you up at 8.

947
01:03:50,351 --> 01:03:52,965
Hey Johnny, it's me.

948
01:03:52,999 --> 01:03:54,863
go away

949
01:03:54,898 --> 01:03:58,139
Johnny open the door please,
I want to talk

950
01:04:07,407 --> 01:04:09,876
Jesus Christ, what the fuck man

951
01:04:09,911 --> 01:04:12,471
sorry, look Johnny,
I know your pissed alright

952
01:04:12,505 --> 01:04:14,251
but just listen to me for 5 seconds

953
01:04:14,286 --> 01:04:16,782
I saw Lori leaving the
apartment with Rex

954
01:04:16,817 --> 01:04:17,740
what?

955
01:04:17,775 --> 01:04:20,788
I’m serious John. I went over to talk to her,
maybe take some of the heat off you

956
01:04:20,824 --> 01:04:22,443
and there he was, picking her up

957
01:04:22,476 --> 01:04:23,869
they were going to the hat shell

958
01:04:23,904 --> 01:04:26,370
your fucking unbelievable
you know that

959
01:04:26,405 --> 01:04:27,747
I mean how stupid do
you think I am?

960
01:04:27,748 --> 01:04:32,137
if you think that by making shit up like that your going
to make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her

961
01:04:32,138 --> 01:04:34,231
your out your fucking mind.
John it’s the truth I’m telling you

962
01:04:34,266 --> 01:04:36,224
you know what, get out of here

963
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:39,195
you know what, your acting like a cock
you know that?

964
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:42,165
what?
I’m acting like a cock?

965
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:44,680
yes, you are. so shut your meat hole
for a second and listen to me

966
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:47,986
huh?... meat hole,
that’s not right is it... no

967
01:04:48,021 --> 01:04:54,415
pudding hole... is that what they say, no can’t be that either
right. cos how can you have any pudding, if you don’t eat your meat

968
01:04:55,714 --> 01:05:00,824
pink Floyd thing... the point is, your blaming
me, for something that you did to yourself

969
01:05:00,859 --> 01:05:06,326
Lori was right about you. you cannot take any
responsibility for anything that goes on in your life

970
01:05:06,361 --> 01:05:07,705
oh and you can?

971
01:05:07,740 --> 01:05:09,961
I don’t have to,
I’m a fucking teddy bear

972
01:05:09,996 --> 01:05:13,638
you know something... I didn’t tie
you up and drag you to that party

973
01:05:13,673 --> 01:05:16,815
alright, I wanted you to come because
your supposedly my best friend

974
01:05:16,850 --> 01:05:19,860
you can’t stand there and tell me you haven’t
always seen Lori as a threat to our friendship

975
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:23,982
I mean it works out so much better for you when we’re
getting fucked up on the couch at 9A.M doesn’t it?

976
01:05:24,018 --> 01:05:27,911
listen to yourself, what am I, emperor
Ming here controlling your mind

977
01:05:27,947 --> 01:05:33,335
that’s your choice John. and you know by blaming
me, you just make yourself look like a pussy

978
01:05:34,307 --> 01:05:39,069
you know, sometimes I think back to that
Christmas morning, when I was 8 years old

979
01:05:39,104 --> 01:05:40,970
I wish I’d just gotten
a teddy ruxpin

980
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,863
say that 1 more time...

981
01:05:43,864 --> 01:05:47,270
teddy... rux... fucking... pin

982
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:17,375
shit, ou
fuck man

983
01:07:04,806 --> 01:07:06,001
fucking stop

984
01:07:17,965 --> 01:07:19,699
why you crying?

985
01:07:19,734 --> 01:07:23,160
my dick is squished by the TV

986
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:35,048
I’m so sorry Johnny

987
01:07:35,049 --> 01:07:36,536
so am I man

988
01:07:37,514 --> 01:07:38,785
I love you

989
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:40,439
I love you too

990
01:07:41,494 --> 01:07:42,827
listen

991
01:07:42,862 --> 01:07:46,218
you got to let me help you make
things right with you and Lori

992
01:07:46,254 --> 01:07:48,666
there’s no putting things right,
she fucking hates me

993
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:53,418
look, john, we can get her back

994
01:07:53,451 --> 01:07:59,235
you remember when you were 10?
and you hit that squirrel with your bb gun

995
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:03,325
and then when we seen it fall from the
tree we both started crying, you remember?

996
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:06,945
and we ran up to it, and
we tried to give it CPR

997
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:08,952
and it came back to life.

998
01:08:08,987 --> 01:08:11,906
John, we could do that again

999
01:08:11,907 --> 01:08:15,783
ted, we blew out its rib cage and crushed
its lungs trying to give it CPR

1000
01:08:15,816 --> 01:08:17,165
It died.

1001
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:20,565
Come on, were going to the hat shell.

1002
01:09:11,121 --> 01:09:13,948
Thanks. We're going to take a short break,
but we’ll be back in a few.

1003
01:09:22,384 --> 01:09:24,592
Hey, play chopsticks you jazzy slut.

1004
01:09:24,626 --> 01:09:25,674
Teddy!

1005
01:09:25,937 --> 01:09:26,918
How are you?

1006
01:09:27,223 --> 01:09:28,902
how you doing you fuzzy
little asshole?

1007
01:09:28,938 --> 01:09:33,748
Oh you know, I'm not a hot half Muslim chick who’s
sold 37 million records, but I’m hanging in there.

1008
01:09:33,783 --> 01:09:35,893
half Indian, but thanks

1009
01:09:35,928 --> 01:09:38,554
yeah whatever, thanks for 9-11. hey listen,
I want you to meet a good pal of mine alright

1010
01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:40,927
John Bennett... Norah Jones

1011
01:09:42,067 --> 01:09:44,917
hi
- hey there... sweaty

1012
01:09:44,953 --> 01:09:47,863
you ready to bring down the house?

1013
01:09:47,897 --> 01:09:51,327
yes ma'am. thank you for the
opportunity miss... ma'am... Jones

1014
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:53,388
Thank you.

1015
01:09:53,422 --> 01:09:54,696
Jesus, you look fantastic

1016
01:09:54,697 --> 01:09:57,296
well, your probably not used
to seeing me fully clothed

1017
01:09:58,057 --> 01:10:03,029
I know right. me and Norah met in 2002
at a party at Belinda Carlisle’s house

1018
01:10:03,064 --> 01:10:05,520
and we had awkward fuzzy
sex in the cloak room

1019
01:10:05,555 --> 01:10:07,202
actually you went so bad
for a guy with no penis

1020
01:10:07,238 --> 01:10:10,867
yeah. you know, I’ve written so
many angry letters to Hasbro about that

1021
01:10:13,147 --> 01:10:14,339
thank you

1022
01:10:14,374 --> 01:10:17,957
so I’m going to give my chops a rest,
and bring a friend up to the stage

1023
01:10:17,993 --> 01:10:22,184
he’s going to sing a song to a special
lady in the audience who he loves very much

1024
01:10:22,219 --> 01:10:25,541
please give a big hand,
to John Bennett

1025
01:10:28,011 --> 01:10:30,290
oh... my god

1026
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:33,144
holy shit

1027
01:10:35,729 --> 01:10:38,085
I got to fuck her again

1028
01:10:39,655 --> 01:10:43,499
umm high, my names John Bennett

1029
01:10:43,534 --> 01:10:47,292
and this is for Lori Collins,
cos I love you

1030
01:10:49,145 --> 01:10:55,158
and this song always reminds me of the most
important night of my life. the night we met

1031
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:59,628
umm, this is the theme song
from the movie octopussy

1032
01:11:16,855 --> 01:11:18,519
still better than Katy Perry

1033
01:11:42,175 --> 01:11:44,083
you suck, get off the stage

1034
01:11:44,116 --> 01:11:45,545
aww come on, give him a chance

1035
01:11:51,749 --> 01:11:52,855
your an asshole

1036
01:11:59,131 --> 01:12:00,011
oh Jesus

1037
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:03,083
someone call an ambulance

1038
01:12:12,962 --> 01:12:14,265
that was insane

1039
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:16,981
did you see the way the guys body hit
the ground?. it was like a rag doll

1040
01:12:18,406 --> 01:12:20,382
I’d rather just not talk about it

1041
01:12:20,418 --> 01:12:22,116
you want to go get a drink after this?

1042
01:12:22,117 --> 01:12:24,331
I feel like I could use one
after seeing a guy almost die

1043
01:12:24,365 --> 01:12:27,086
uh nope, I think I’d rather
just have you take me home

1044
01:12:27,121 --> 01:12:29,795
one drink
come on

1045
01:12:29,830 --> 01:12:31,821
no, not really feeling up to it

1046
01:12:31,856 --> 01:12:33,739
alright, I get it

1047
01:12:33,774 --> 01:12:36,379
and you know, I don’t blame you

1048
01:12:36,415 --> 01:12:41,653
I mean thing about it, it was actually
unfair of him to embarrass you like that

1049
01:12:42,831 --> 01:12:45,547
just to be clear,
I’m not embarrassed

1050
01:12:45,583 --> 01:12:49,543
so John and I have our problems,
but at least he tried

1051
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:53,844
you know what, I don’t feel
like talking to you about this

1052
01:12:53,879 --> 01:12:55,774
where you going?

1053
01:12:55,809 --> 01:12:58,299
taking a cab, I’m going home

1054
01:13:03,393 --> 01:13:04,420
finally

1055
01:13:15,061 --> 01:13:18,799
down here, not looking up your
towel, swear to god

1056
01:13:18,835 --> 01:13:21,031
not looking up your towel,
not looking at your funny business

1057
01:13:21,067 --> 01:13:22,878
ted, what are you doing here?

1058
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:25,069
I need to talk to you

1059
01:13:25,104 --> 01:13:27,728
listen if your here to fight
Johns battles for him it’s not...

1060
01:13:27,763 --> 01:13:31,083
just let me talk first alright,
and then you can say whatever you want

1061
01:13:35,335 --> 01:13:39,022
look, John loves you very much

1062
01:13:39,057 --> 01:13:41,547
more than anything in the world

1063
01:13:41,548 --> 01:13:44,160
and he’s falling to fucking
pieces without you

1064
01:13:44,195 --> 01:13:48,140
he knows he screwed up huge. but you
got to believe me,

1065
01:13:48,175 --> 01:13:53,218
it wasn’t all his fault alright. I told
him to bail on you that night at Rex's

1066
01:13:53,253 --> 01:13:56,295
and he said no, he was going
to stay there with you

1067
01:13:56,330 --> 01:13:57,994
and I twisted his arm Lori

1068
01:13:58,030 --> 01:14:01,263
so if you just give
him one more chance

1069
01:14:01,299 --> 01:14:04,226
I promise I will leave,
and I’ll never come back

1070
01:14:04,261 --> 01:14:06,302
alright... he’ll be all yours

1071
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:11,946
ted, that’s a really nice offer.
but I don’t want you to do that

1072
01:14:11,981 --> 01:14:16,539
this is between John and me,
and I don’t think it can be fixed

1073
01:14:16,574 --> 01:14:17,962
yeah because of me

1074
01:14:17,997 --> 01:14:21,096
look look Lori,
you want him to be a man

1075
01:14:21,131 --> 01:14:24,683
but as long as he’s got his teddy bear,
he’s always going to be a boy

1076
01:14:27,753 --> 01:14:33,392
he’s waiting down at Charles right now,
so if you go down there and just talk to him

1077
01:14:33,428 --> 01:14:36,067
I’ll be gone when you get back

1078
01:14:37,145 --> 01:14:38,553
forever

1079
01:14:39,713 --> 01:14:44,092
and you’ll see. hell never be
scared of thunder again

1080
01:15:28,970 --> 01:15:31,590
Michelob ultra Tuscan
orange grapefruit

1081
01:15:31,624 --> 01:15:34,409
my god, Americas imploding

1082
01:15:43,414 --> 01:15:44,643
high ted

1083
01:15:44,678 --> 01:15:46,263
fuck!

1084
01:16:05,664 --> 01:16:06,799
Lori... what...

1085
01:16:06,834 --> 01:16:08,245
hey

1086
01:16:08,281 --> 01:16:09,614
what are you doing here?

1087
01:16:09,615 --> 01:16:11,743
you can thank ted

1088
01:16:15,886 --> 01:16:18,231
should I... should I sit?

1089
01:16:18,265 --> 01:16:21,301
yeah... if you want
- ok

1090
01:16:24,017 --> 01:16:26,228
so works good?
everything’s good there?

1091
01:16:26,263 --> 01:16:28,404
yeah, works good

1092
01:16:29,495 --> 01:16:33,407
well I guess we can’t make
small talk all day huh?

1093
01:16:34,413 --> 01:16:37,705
if it’s ok with you, I just want
to say what I want to say

1094
01:16:39,335 --> 01:16:43,448
look I could sit here and tell you I’m sorry, and
it was a huge misunderstanding, I’m ready to change

1095
01:16:43,483 --> 01:16:47,224
but I don’t think you want to
hear any of that crap

1096
01:16:47,261 --> 01:16:52,161
I’m not going to try and get you
to take me back. I mean, why would you

1097
01:16:52,197 --> 01:16:55,136
I’ve been a really shitty boyfriend for
the last 4 years, I don’t deserve you

1098
01:16:55,171 --> 01:17:00,390
look, I know I didn’t take our
relationship seriously, but Lori

1099
01:17:00,426 --> 01:17:02,706
I do love you more than life itself

1100
01:17:02,741 --> 01:17:06,856
and I want is...
I just want to end on good terms

1101
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,755
I owe that to you.

1102
01:17:08,789 --> 01:17:10,736
Alright, I want you to be happy,
you deserve that.

1103
01:17:10,770 --> 01:17:15,567
and I just hope, you know,
that we can still be friends

1104
01:17:17,745 --> 01:17:19,789
thank you for being so honest

1105
01:17:22,382 --> 01:17:23,903
that was pretty much it

1106
01:17:27,064 --> 01:17:28,379
Thanks for coming by.

1107
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:03,816
Yeah.

1108
01:18:03,849 --> 01:18:08,636
As you can see, you’ve been a part
of our family for quite some time.

1109
01:18:08,669 --> 01:18:11,674
Welcome home.

1110
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:15,593

of pictures of you guys at my house

1111
01:18:15,629 --> 01:18:17,587

1112
01:18:17,622 --> 01:18:20,244

1113
01:18:21,379 --> 01:18:25,886
ted you've arrived at a lucky time,
it’s almost Robert's play hour

1114
01:18:25,922 --> 01:18:29,086
I’m guessing you guys don’t have a ps3

1115
01:18:29,121 --> 01:18:31,310
I’m guessing your more of a wooden
horse with a wig kind a family

1116
01:18:31,345 --> 01:18:33,158
yeah

1117
01:18:33,837 --> 01:18:35,329

01:18:36,263 --> 01:18:37,625

1120
01:18:47,933 --> 01:18:51,080
ted, you belong to Robert now.
you do as he says

1121
01:18:51,116 --> 01:18:54,415
you think your just going to get away with a
kidnapping?. it’s a nice fucking example your setting

1122
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:56,911
LANGUAGE!... sorry sorry

1123
01:19:02,672 --> 01:19:05,666
you know ted,
when I was a little boy

1124
01:19:06,918 --> 01:19:13,351
I saw you on television, and I thought you were the
most amazing most wonderful thing I’d ever seen, ever.

1125
01:19:13,387 --> 01:19:20,328
and I asked my dad if I could have
a magical teddy bear too

1126
01:19:20,363 --> 01:19:21,721
and he said no

1127
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:24,262
can you just email me
the rest of this story...

1128
01:19:24,297 --> 01:19:26,335
and I was so heartbroken

1129
01:19:27,426 --> 01:19:36,047
and I promised myself that if I ever had a
son,i would never, ever, ever, say no to him

1130
01:19:36,777 --> 01:19:38,168
ever

1131
01:19:38,202 --> 01:19:41,688
maybe no to a snickers bar every
once and a while wouldn't hurt

1132
01:19:41,724 --> 01:19:44,005
me and ted are going to
be best friends daddy

1133
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:47,265

1137
01:19:59,338 --> 01:20:01,774
daddy punished me for it

1138
01:20:01,809 --> 01:20:04,124
that’s a great story,
I felt like I was there

1139
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:05,970

1149
01:20:42,851 --> 01:20:46,098

before I play this game?

1150
01:20:46,803 --> 01:20:50,625

01:23:24,746 --> 01:23:25,930
look, whoever this is,
it’s not a good time

1168

1184
01:24:01,515 --> 01:24:03,504
Can you call him back?

Jesus

1213
01:26:58,502 --> 01:26:59,560
there he is, pullover

1214
01:27:37,036 --> 01:27:41,306
no... you can’t have my teddy bear...

1215
01:27:47,916 --> 01:27:49,777
holy shit

1216
01:27:49,813 --> 01:27:52,937
Sorry, somebody had to go
Joan Crawford on that kid.

1217
01:27:52,971 --> 01:27:54,356
Come on.

1218
01:27:59,898 --> 01:28:00,862
Ted?

1219
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:08,919
Oh my god.

1220
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,653
Ahh, shit.

1221
01:28:38,873 --> 01:28:41,352
- Jesus, stay here.
- No, no, no, John.

1222
01:28:41,388 --> 01:28:42,683
- Wait, John.
- Stay here.

1223
01:28:53,877 --> 01:28:55,218
You're mine, Ted.

1224
01:28:55,253 --> 01:28:58,144
Screw you pal,
I belong to John Bennett.

1225
01:28:58,179 --> 01:29:00,496
But I can give you love

1226
01:29:00,531 --> 01:29:03,544
and rocking horses,
and dancing

1227
01:29:03,579 --> 01:29:06,698
I think we're very
far apart on this.

1228
01:29:26,286 --> 01:29:28,476
Ted?
- Johnny.

1229
01:30:17,126 --> 01:30:17,764
Oh, my god.

1230
01:30:17,765 --> 01:30:19,616
Ted.

1231
01:30:21,046 --> 01:30:22,462
John.

1232
01:30:22,498 --> 01:30:24,789
Lori, get the stuffing.
Get it all.

1233
01:30:29,653 --> 01:30:31,557
Johnny...

1234
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:35,285
your going to be ok buddy, can you
understand? your going to be fine

1235
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:39,088
Jesus, I look like the
robot from Aliens

1236
01:30:39,123 --> 01:30:42,687
look at me buddy. I promise,
your going to be ok

1237
01:30:42,722 --> 01:30:45,207
I don’t think so.

1238
01:30:45,241 --> 01:30:49,893
I'm a... I'm... I'm in trouble

1239
01:30:49,927 --> 01:30:53,378
I need... I need to
tell you something.

1240
01:30:53,412 --> 01:30:55,218
What is it?

1241
01:30:57,189 --> 01:31:00,205
don’t... don’t ever
lose her again

1242
01:31:01,263 --> 01:31:03,508
she’s the most important...

1243
01:31:04,934 --> 01:31:08,249
most important
part of your life

1244
01:31:08,283 --> 01:31:12,755
even... even more than me

1245
01:31:14,017 --> 01:31:16,127
she’s your thunder buddy now

1246
01:31:16,928 --> 01:31:18,903
She's...

1247
01:32:01,776 --> 01:32:03,170
I got it

1248
01:32:19,852 --> 01:32:21,352
baby, I don’t know if
this is going to work

1249
01:32:21,354 --> 01:32:22,705
please, just try

1250
01:32:32,871 --> 01:32:33,974
come on buddy

1251
01:33:21,146 --> 01:33:22,027
I’m so sorry

1252
01:33:23,635 --> 01:33:25,535
you did everything you could

1253
01:33:26,576 --> 01:33:28,572
I’m so sorry

1254
01:36:03,367 --> 01:36:04,077
Ted.

1255
01:36:04,078 --> 01:36:06,242
- I'm alive Johnny,
- Oh my god.

1256
01:36:06,277 --> 01:36:07,053
I’m alive

1257
01:36:07,089 --> 01:36:09,532
your magic always worked

1258
01:36:09,566 --> 01:36:11,271
your back, I cant...

1259
01:36:11,305 --> 01:36:15,316
yeah, I mean when you sawed me up, you put
some of the stuffing in the wrong places John

1260
01:36:15,349 --> 01:36:19,509
I'm a little fucked up, but will you
take care of me forever and ever?

1261
01:36:21,940 --> 01:36:25,905
nah... I’m just kidding with you, I thought it
would be funny if you thought I was fucking retarded.

1262
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:28,777
- You asshole.
- Come here you bastard.

1263
01:36:32,428 --> 01:36:33,959
Welcome back ted.

1264
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:37,972
It was you.

1265
01:36:38,008 --> 01:36:40,486
You did it.

1266
01:36:40,521 --> 01:36:44,231
Son of a bitch.
You wished for my life back.

1267
01:36:44,267 --> 01:36:47,007
No... no no.

1268
01:36:47,042 --> 01:36:48,855
I wished for my life back.

1269
01:37:01,464 --> 01:37:02,818
I love you.

1270
01:37:02,852 --> 01:37:04,186
I love you too.

1271
01:37:05,450 --> 01:37:07,632
and I want you to know that

1272
01:37:08,636 --> 01:37:11,941
after last night, I don’t want to
lose anyone that matters to me ever again

1273
01:37:11,978 --> 01:37:14,674
I'm not going to wait any
longer for my life to start.

1274
01:37:14,708 --> 01:37:16,968
...Lori

1275
01:37:17,679 --> 01:37:19,911
will you marry me?

1276
01:37:20,964 --> 01:37:25,671
All I ever wanted
was you John Bennett.

1277
01:37:30,124 --> 01:37:34,613
And so, John and Lori and ted,
lived happily ever after

1278
01:37:34,647 --> 01:37:39,774
having discovered at last, that all
they really needed was each other

1279
01:37:42,299 --> 01:37:48,384
John and Lori were married in Cambridge,
by a very special justice of the peace

1280
01:37:48,419 --> 01:37:51,171
by the power vested in me

1281
01:37:51,205 --> 01:37:54,085
by the New York Jets

1282
01:37:54,120 --> 01:37:58,227
and by the united peoples
of the planet Mongo

1283
01:37:58,261 --> 01:38:02,882
I now pronounce you,
man and wife

1284
01:38:02,917 --> 01:38:05,016
you may kiss the bride Johnny

1285
01:38:28,702 --> 01:38:30,632
thanks so much for coming

1286
01:38:30,667 --> 01:38:34,328
my daughter better be alive
you sick son of a bitch

1287
01:38:35,790 --> 01:38:38,658
I am so fake happy for her.

1288
01:39:06,011 --> 01:39:09,295
Ahh, you know Sam, there’s only
one way to end a perfect day.

1289
01:39:09,330 --> 01:39:10,497
What's that?

1290
01:39:10,533 --> 01:39:11,911
Flash jump.

1291
01:39:11,946 --> 01:39:13,155
Right.

1292
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,098
1... 2...

1293
01:39:15,134 --> 01:39:15,653
3.

1294
01:39:15,688 --> 01:39:17,137
Yeah.

1295
01:39:22,562 --> 01:39:29,850
And that's the story of how one magical wish, forever
changed the lives of three very special friends.

1296
01:39:29,885 --> 01:39:34,938
Ted and Tammy-Lynn continued there
torrid love affair for quite some time.

1297
01:39:34,973 --> 01:39:42,438
One afternoon, ted was caught behind the deli counter,
eating potato salad off of Tammy-Lynn's bare bottom.

1298
01:39:42,473 --> 01:39:45,791
He was instantly promoted
to store manager.

1299
01:39:46,852 --> 01:39:51,601
Sam Jones moved back to Hollywood,
with the goal of restarting his film career.

1300
01:39:51,636 --> 01:39:57,646
He currently resides in Burbank where he shares
a studio apartment with his roommate Brandon rout.

1301
01:39:57,682 --> 01:40:01,969
Remember Brandon rout, from
that god awful superman movie?

1302
01:40:02,003 --> 01:40:06,338
Jesus Christ. Thanks for getting our
hopes up and taking a giant shit on us.

1303
01:40:07,624 --> 01:40:12,332
Rex was forced to give
up his pursuit of Lori.

1304
01:40:12,367 --> 01:40:16,661
Not long after, he fell into a deep
depression and died of Lou Gehrig’s disease.

1305
01:40:16,696 --> 01:40:21,935
Donny was arrested by Boston police and
charged with kidnapping a plush toy.

1306
01:40:21,969 --> 01:40:26,992
The charge was dropped when everyone
realised how completely stupid that sounded.

1307
01:40:27,671 --> 01:40:31,091
Robert got a trainer, lost a
substantial amount of weight,

1308
01:40:31,092 --> 01:40:33,834
and went on to become Taylor lautner.

1309
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:37,495
