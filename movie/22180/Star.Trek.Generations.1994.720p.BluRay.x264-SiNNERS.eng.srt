1
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:07,020
How does it feel to be back
on the Enterprise bridge, Captain Kirk?

2
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:13,986
- How do you feel?
- Excuse me.

3
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:17,531
There will be time
for questions later.

4
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:21,910
I'm Captain John Harriman
and I'd like to welcome you aboard.

5
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:29,001
We're excited to have a group of living
legends with us on our maiden voyage.

6
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:33,755
- I read about you in grade school.
- Oh, really?

7
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:42,347
- May we have a look around?
- Please.

8
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:47,019
Demora!

9
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:52,608
This is the first Enterprise without
you in command. What is that like?

10
00:03:52,816 --> 00:03:57,863
- I'm glad to send her on her way.
- What have you been doing?

11
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:04,620
- Keeping busy.
- Give him a chance to look around.

12
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:16,006
Captain...

13
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:21,678
I'd like you to meet the helmsman
of the Enterprise-B. Demora?

14
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:26,141
Ensign Demora Sulu.

15
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:32,689
It's a pleasure to meet you. My father's
told me interesting stories about you.

16
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:41,323
- You father is Hikaru Sulu?
- You've met her before. 12 years ago.

17
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:46,620
12 years? Incredible.

18
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:53,460
Congratulations. No Enterprise is
complete without a Sulu at the helm.

19
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:58,048
- Hikaru must be very proud of you.
- I hope so.

20
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:05,597
- I was never that young.
- No...

21
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:09,476
You were younger.

22
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:15,399
- Damn fine ship, if you ask me.
- Scotty, it absolutely amazes me.

23
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:21,780
- What would that be, sir?
- When did Sulu find time for a family?

24
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:28,954
If something's important, you make
the time. Is that why you're so restless?

25
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:34,334
- Finding retirement a little lonely?
- I'm glad you're an engineer.

26
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:37,379
You'd make a lousy psychiatrist.

27
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,637
- Gentlemen, if you'll take your seats.
- Yes, of course.

28
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:52,144
Aft thrusters ahead one quarter,
port and starboard at station keeping.

29
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:57,816
Captain Kirk, I'd be honoured
if you'd give the order to get underway.

30
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:03,989
- Thank you very much, I...
- Please, sir... Please, I insist.

31
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:17,461
Take us out.

32
00:06:23,467 --> 00:06:28,055
- Very good, sir.
- Brought a tear to my eye.

33
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:53,372
Now that you've seen the ship,
how does it feel to be back?

34
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,916
Fine, fine.

35
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:03,924
We've just cleared the asteroid belt.
Today, we'll go beyond Pluto and back.

36
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:07,678
- Just a quick run around the block.
- Will you test the warp drive system?

37
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:13,642
We're picking up a distress call,
Captain.

38
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:18,856
On speakers.

39
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:24,319
This is the transport ship Lakul. We're
caught in some energy distortion.

40
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:28,657
Two ships in our... trapped
in a severe gravimetric distortion.

41
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:35,622
We can't break free, we need help.
It's tearing us apart.

42
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:40,627
The Lakul is one of two ships
flying El Aurian refugees to Earth.

43
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:46,049
- Can you locate them?
- They are bearing at 310/205.

44
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:51,054
Distance: Three light years.

45
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:59,104
Signal the closest starship. We're
in no condition to mount a rescue.

46
00:08:00,814 --> 00:08:06,069
- We don't have a full crew aboard.
- We're the only one in range, sir.

47
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:17,080
Well, then.
I guess it's up to us.

48
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:23,420
Helm, lay in an intercept course
and engage at maximum warp.

49
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:36,183
Captain, is there something wrong
with your chair?

50
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,652
We're within visual range
of the energy distortion, Captain.

51
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:49,821
On screen.

52
00:08:52,783 --> 00:08:56,119
What the hell is that?

53
00:08:56,328 --> 00:09:00,874
I've located the transport ships.

54
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:05,879
Their hulls can't take the stress.
They won't survive much longer.

55
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:15,889
We're encountering severe gravimetric
distortions from the energy ribbon.

56
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:21,728
- We'll have to keep our distance.
- Tractor beam...

57
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:28,235
We don't have one.
It won't be installed until Tuesday.

58
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:32,072
Ensign Sulu...

59
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:38,579
Generate a subspace field around
the ships. That might break them free.

60
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:43,167
- Too much quantum interference, sir.
- What about...

61
00:09:43,375 --> 00:09:50,299
Vent plasma from the warp nacelles.
That might disrupt the ribbon's hold.

62
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:56,805
- It's not having any effect...
- The starboard vessel is collapsing!

63
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:07,482
- How many people were on that ship?
- 265.

64
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:18,452
Sir, the Lakul's hull integrity
is down to 12%.

65
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:31,715
Captain Kirk, I'd appreciate
any suggestions you might have.

66
00:10:31,924 --> 00:10:37,679
- Move us in and beam them aboard.
- The distortions will tear us apart.

67
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,308
Risk is part of the game.

68
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:45,646
- Close to within transporter range.
- And turn that damn thing off!

69
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,906
- We're within range.
- Beam them directly to sickbay.

70
00:10:56,114 --> 00:11:01,662
- How big is your medical staff?
- It... doesn't arrive until Tuesday.

71
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:09,002
- You and you are now nurses.
- The warp plasma relays are unstable.

72
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:15,759
I can't lock on to them.
They are in some sort of temporal flux.

73
00:11:18,929 --> 00:11:25,477
Their life signs are phasing in
and out of our space-time continuum.

74
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:30,107
- Their hull's collapsing!
- Beam them out, Scotty!

75
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,992
Transport complete.

76
00:11:44,663 --> 00:11:50,002
I got 47... out of 150.

77
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,687
- Report!
- We're caught in a gravimetric field.

78
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,814
Full reverse!

79
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:21,200
We're going to help you.

80
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:26,997
- Everything is fine.
- Why? Why?

81
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:34,505
- You're safe here on the Enterprise.
- No, I have to go back.

82
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:39,718
You don't understand.
Let me go back. Let me go back!

83
00:12:39,927 --> 00:12:44,223
Let me go back. Please!

84
00:12:45,641 --> 00:12:50,854
- What was he talking about?
- I have no idea.

85
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,194
Can I help you?

86
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:04,451
It's going to be okay.
You just need to rest.

87
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,252
You can't disrupt
this big a gravimetric field.

88
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:18,882
- Hull integrity at 82%.
- But I do have a theory.

89
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:25,013
An anti-matter discharge ahead might
disrupt the field so we can escape.

90
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:30,477
- Photon torpedo.
- Fire torpedo at my command.

91
00:13:30,686 --> 00:13:36,066
- We don't have any.
- Don't tell me... Tuesday?

92
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:38,360
40%.

93
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:44,116
A resonance burst from the deflector
dish could simulate a torpedo blast.

94
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:51,331
- Where are the deflector relays?
- I'll go. You have the bridge.

95
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:59,965
Wait.

96
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:05,220
Your place is on the bridge
of your ship. I'll take care of it.

97
00:14:09,725 --> 00:14:15,105
- Keep things together until I get back.
- I always do.

98
00:15:20,921 --> 00:15:25,592
- 45 seconds to structural collapse.
- Bridge to Captain Kirk.

99
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:32,516
- Kirk here.
- I can't hold her together much longer.

100
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,860
Let's go!

101
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:46,446
Activate main deflector.

102
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,205
We're breaking free.

103
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:17,644
It's all right. I'm increasing power
to compensate.

104
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:22,024
- We're clear.
- You did it, Kirk! Damage report.

105
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:27,154
Buckling on the starboard nacelle
and a hull breach in Engineering.

106
00:16:27,362 --> 00:16:31,783
- Emergency force fields in place.
- Where?

107
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:37,206
Sections 20-28
on decks 13, 14...

108
00:16:38,832 --> 00:16:41,668
...and 15.

109
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:47,883
Bridge to Captain Kirk.
Captain Kirk, please respond.

110
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:56,975
Have Chekov meet me on deck 15.

111
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:26,880
My God! Was anyone in here?

112
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,177
Aye.

113
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:43,207
Bring out the prisoner.

114
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:59,223
Mr Worf. I knew this day would come.
Are you prepared to face the charges?

115
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,935
Answer him.

116
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,731
I am prepared.

117
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:14,696
"We, the officers and crew
of the U.S.S. Enterprise -

118
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:19,409
- hereby make the following charges
against Lieutenant Worf."

119
00:19:19,618 --> 00:19:28,043
"That he did wilfully perform above the
call of duty on countless occasions."

120
00:19:28,293 --> 00:19:34,466
"Most seriously: That he has earned
the admiration of the entire crew."

121
00:19:34,675 --> 00:19:38,929
I hereby promote you
to Lieutenant Commander -

122
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:45,519
- with all the rights and privileges
thereto. May God have mercy on you.

123
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:55,571
- Hip, hip...
- Hooray!

124
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:00,742
- Congratulations.
- Extend the plank.

125
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:12,004
Lower the Badge of Office.

126
00:20:15,048 --> 00:20:17,593
He'll never make it. No one ever has.

127
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:47,456
I've learned never
to underestimate a Klingon.

128
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:56,089
Computer, remove the plank.

129
00:21:05,974 --> 00:21:12,064
Number One, that's retract plank,
not remove plank.

130
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:17,319
Sorry.

131
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:30,082
I am uncertain as to why someone
falling into freezing water is amusing.

132
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:36,296
- It's all in good fun, Data.
- Fun? I do not understand.

133
00:21:37,548 --> 00:21:42,928
Get into the spirit of things.
Be spontaneous, live in the moment.

134
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:46,765
- Do something unexpected. Get it?
- Got it.

135
00:22:10,289 --> 00:22:14,751
Data. That was not funny.

136
00:22:17,004 --> 00:22:22,634
All hands, make sail. T'gansuls
and courses, stand by the braces.

137
00:22:22,843 --> 00:22:25,971
Will.

138
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:33,187
Just imagine what it was like.
No engines, no computers.

139
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:39,067
Just the wind and the sea
and the stars to guide you.

140
00:22:39,276 --> 00:22:46,325
- Bad food, brutal discipline, no women.
- Bridge to Captain Picard.

141
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:52,039
- A personal message from Earth.
- Put it through down here.

142
00:22:52,247 --> 00:22:58,962
The best thing was that no one could
reach you. This was freedom, Will.

143
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:04,092
Computer, arch.

144
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:09,348
Look alive there.

145
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:26,073
Take the wheel.

146
00:23:45,634 --> 00:23:50,681
Captain, are you all right?

147
00:23:50,889 --> 00:23:55,561
Yes, I'm fine...
Excuse me.

148
00:23:57,104 --> 00:24:00,649
Computer, exit.

149
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:10,492
- Set royals and stunsuls.
- What's a stunsul, sir?

150
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:15,998
- Just above that last yardarm...
- Bridge to Halodeck 3.

151
00:24:16,206 --> 00:24:21,753
The Amargosa observatory needs help.
They say they are under attack.

152
00:24:21,962 --> 00:24:25,591
Red alert! All hands to battle
stations. Captain Picard to the bridge.

153
00:24:39,146 --> 00:24:43,317
- We're too late.
- There are no other ships here.

154
00:24:43,525 --> 00:24:49,948
- The observatory took quite a beating.
- Survivors?

155
00:24:50,157 --> 00:24:55,496
- Sensors show five life signs aboard.
- The station's complement was 19.

156
00:24:58,081 --> 00:25:01,210
Stand down from red alert.

157
00:25:02,753 --> 00:25:05,589
Number One...

158
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:13,555
Begin an investigation.
Make it so... Just do it!

159
00:25:16,016 --> 00:25:19,895
- Mr Worf.
- Aye, sir.

160
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:37,120
Worf.

161
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:44,586
- It looks like a type-3 disrupter.
- Romulan, Breen or Klingon.

162
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:31,049
Over here!

163
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:36,680
It's all right. Do not struggle.

164
00:26:43,604 --> 00:26:47,941
It's okay. We're right here.

165
00:26:55,157 --> 00:26:59,786
I'm Commander William Riker
from the Starship Enterprise.

166
00:26:59,995 --> 00:27:04,082
Doctor Tolian Soran.

167
00:27:04,291 --> 00:27:10,881
- Who attacked you, Doctor?
- I don't know. It happened so fast.

168
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,800
Take a look at this.

169
00:27:34,905 --> 00:27:37,157
Romulans.

170
00:27:39,785 --> 00:27:42,704
What possessed you
to push her in the water?

171
00:27:42,955 --> 00:27:46,917
I was attempting
to get into the spirit of things.

172
00:27:47,876 --> 00:27:51,922
I thought it would be amusing.

173
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:57,511
- Is she still angry?
- You'd better stay away from her.

174
00:28:09,898 --> 00:28:13,944
Data, you're not thinking
about using that thing, are you?

175
00:28:14,152 --> 00:28:16,905
I have for many months.

176
00:28:17,156 --> 00:28:22,911
In light of my recent episode,
now may be the appropriate time.

177
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,417
- It may overload your neural net.
- That is true.

178
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:35,924
However, my growth as an artificial
life form has reached an impasse.

179
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:40,596
For 34 years I've endeavoured
to become more "human", -

180
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:44,558
- to grow beyond my programming.

181
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:51,190
Still, I am unable to grasp
such a basic concept as humour.

182
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:56,904
This emotion chip
may be the only answer.

183
00:29:09,374 --> 00:29:12,794
Geordi.

184
00:29:13,545 --> 00:29:16,798
All right.

185
00:29:29,436 --> 00:29:34,608
At the first sign of trouble,
I'll deactivate it. Agreed?

186
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:38,237
Agreed.

187
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:49,790
We found two dead Romulans. We'll
try to establish what ship they're from.

188
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:56,505
- But why did they attack the station?
- They practically tore the place apart.

189
00:29:56,755 --> 00:30:02,761
Accessed the computer, turned the
place inside out, looking for something.

190
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:08,433
This could signify
a new Romulan threat in this sector.

191
00:30:10,269 --> 00:30:14,731
- Inform Starfleet Command.
- You want me to contact Starfleet?

192
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,444
- Is there a problem?
- No, sir.

193
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:26,243
One of the scientists, a Dr Soran,
insisted on speaking with you.

194
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:31,081
I told him you were busy,
but he said it was imperative.

195
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:35,169
Understood. That will be all.

196
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:47,014
- Sir, is there anything?
- No, thank you.

197
00:31:02,863 --> 00:31:08,160
Gentlemen. Something new
from Frocas Three.

198
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,710
What?

199
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:20,672
This beverage has produced
an emotional response.

200
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:25,969
- What are you feeling?
- I am uncertain.

201
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:31,308
I've had little experience with emotion
and can't articulate the sensation.

202
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:37,606
- Emotion?
- I'll explain later.

203
00:31:39,316 --> 00:31:45,447
- It looks like he hates it.
- Yes, that is it.

204
00:31:45,656 --> 00:31:50,744
- I hate this.
- Data, I think the chip is working.

205
00:31:53,622 --> 00:31:58,836
- I hate this. It is revolting.
- More?

206
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:12,724
I'm looking for a Dr Soran
from the observatory.

207
00:32:21,358 --> 00:32:28,073
Dr Soran. I understand there's
something urgent you wish to discuss.

208
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:35,539
I must return and continue a critical
experiment on the Amargosa Star.

209
00:32:35,747 --> 00:32:41,879
When our investigation is complete,
you and your colleagues can return.

210
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:47,843
- Until then, there's nothing I can do.
- Timing is crucial to my experiments.

211
00:32:48,051 --> 00:32:53,056
If it's not completed in 12 hours,
years of research will be lost.

212
00:32:53,265 --> 00:32:56,810
We're doing the best we can.

213
00:32:58,437 --> 00:33:02,816
They say time is the fire
in which we burn.

214
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,533
Right now, my time is running out.

215
00:33:12,493 --> 00:33:17,873
We leave so many things
unfinished in our lives.

216
00:33:18,081 --> 00:33:22,336
I know you understand.

217
00:33:23,462 --> 00:33:27,883
I'll see what I can do.

218
00:34:08,173 --> 00:34:11,009
We've studied the Romulans' tricorder.

219
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:16,431
They were scanning for signature
particles of the compound trilithium.

220
00:34:16,682 --> 00:34:21,854
It's an experiment the Romulans have
been working on, a nuclear inhibitor.

221
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:28,443
It could stop all fusion within a star,
but the Romulans haven't stabilised it.

222
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:32,614
Why look for it
on a Federation observatory?

223
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:36,660
- I do not know.
- Send Geordi and Data over there.

224
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:40,831
Tell them to scan for trilithium.

225
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:49,798
There's no sign
of any trilithium over here.

226
00:34:56,346 --> 00:35:01,602
- I get it! I get it!
- You get what?

227
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:06,523
When you said to Riker:
"The clown can stay, -

228
00:35:06,732 --> 00:35:11,904
- but the Ferengi in the gorilla suit
has to go."

229
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:19,703
During the Farpoint mission. You told
a joke, and that was the punch line.

230
00:35:19,912 --> 00:35:26,043
- That was seven years ago.
- I know. I just got it!

231
00:35:27,169 --> 00:35:30,881
Very funny.

232
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:53,946
Wait. There's a hidden door.
I can see the separation with my visor.

233
00:35:54,154 --> 00:35:59,493
There's a dampening field in operation.
I can't scan beyond the bulkhead.

234
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:07,793
- No control panel or access port.
- It must be magnetically sealed.

235
00:36:08,669 --> 00:36:13,715
I can reverse the polarity
by attenuating my axial servo.

236
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:22,558
Open, Sesame.

237
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:33,944
You could say
I have a magnetic personality.

238
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:38,574
Humour, I love it!

239
00:36:57,134 --> 00:37:01,763
Data, come take a look at this.

240
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:07,519
Have you ever seen a solar probe
like this?

241
00:37:07,728 --> 00:37:11,773
No, Geordi, I have not. Have you?

242
00:37:11,982 --> 00:37:16,278
No, it is most unusual.

243
00:37:16,487 --> 00:37:19,323
Mr Tricorder.

244
00:37:20,073 --> 00:37:26,121
- Just help me get these panels open.
- Make it so.

245
00:37:33,837 --> 00:37:38,550
My visor's picking up something in
the theta band. A trilithium signature?

246
00:37:40,511 --> 00:37:47,017
- We don't have time for this.
- I can't help it. Something is wrong.

247
00:37:54,024 --> 00:37:56,610
Data?

248
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:07,955
Data, are you all right?

249
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:15,879
The emotion chip has overloaded
my positronic relay.

250
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:20,634
We'd better get you back.
LaForge to Enterprise.

251
00:38:23,011 --> 00:38:28,934
- LaForge to Enterprise.
- Is there a problem?

252
00:38:29,142 --> 00:38:35,691
The dampening field is blocking
our Com signal. Can you shut it off?

253
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:39,069
I'd be only too happy to.

254
00:38:49,538 --> 00:38:53,417
Please...

255
00:38:53,625 --> 00:38:58,213
Do not hurt me. Please.

256
00:39:19,485 --> 00:39:22,946
Yes, come.

257
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:27,284
Yes? Is there something
I can do for you?

258
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:32,456
- Can I do anything for you?
- It's just family matters.

259
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:40,881
You never met my brother
and his wife, did you?

260
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,176
Robert.

261
00:39:45,636 --> 00:39:52,518
So opinionated. Pompous and arrogant.
He always had to have the last word.

262
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:59,066
But he mellowed a little bit
in the last few years.

263
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:06,031
I was going to meet them next month
and maybe go to San Francisco.

264
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,579
- Rene wants to see Starfleet Academy.
- Rene? Oh, your nephew.

265
00:40:12,788 --> 00:40:16,959
He's so unlike his father.

266
00:40:17,167 --> 00:40:20,671
He's a dreamer. Imaginative...

267
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:27,886
He's so very gentle.

268
00:40:33,851 --> 00:40:37,437
What's happened?

269
00:40:38,188 --> 00:40:41,650
Robert and Rene...

270
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:47,239
...burned to death in a fire.

271
00:40:48,365 --> 00:40:53,245
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right. These things happen.

272
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:57,875
Captain, it's not all right.

273
00:40:58,083 --> 00:41:06,383
I can't help think about all the
experiences Rene's not going to have.

274
00:41:06,592 --> 00:41:13,849
Not going to the Academy,
listening to music and falling in love.

275
00:41:16,685 --> 00:41:19,646
Building a life.

276
00:41:21,398 --> 00:41:26,987
Well, it's not going to happen now.

277
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:34,077
I didn't realise
he meant so much to you.

278
00:41:34,286 --> 00:41:39,917
Rene was as close as I would get
to having a child of my own.

279
00:41:52,387 --> 00:41:57,434
Your family history
is very important to you, isn't it?

280
00:42:02,147 --> 00:42:08,987
From being a boy, I can remember
hearing about the family line.

281
00:42:09,196 --> 00:42:15,077
The Picard who fought at Trafalgar.
The Picard who won the Nobel Prize.

282
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:20,123
The Picards who settled
the first Martian colonies.

283
00:42:21,416 --> 00:42:27,422
When Robert married
and he had a son, I...

284
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:33,679
You felt it wasn't your responsibility
to carry on the family line.

285
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:39,893
Right. That's it exactly.

286
00:42:42,479 --> 00:42:50,779
Recently I've become aware that there
are fewer days ahead than behind.

287
00:42:50,988 --> 00:42:57,995
But I took some comfort from the fact
that the family would go on.

288
00:43:01,707 --> 00:43:06,587
But now there'll be no more Picards.

289
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:22,686
- Report.
- A quantum implosion in Amargosa.

290
00:43:22,895 --> 00:43:28,025
- All nuclear fusion is breaking down.
- How is that possible?

291
00:43:28,233 --> 00:43:32,613
The observatory launched a solar
probe into the sun a few moments ago.

292
00:43:32,821 --> 00:43:38,577
- The star will collapse in minutes.
- It has produced a level 12 shock wave.

293
00:43:38,785 --> 00:43:45,751
- That'll destroy this entire system.
- I can't locate LaForge or Data.

294
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:49,755
- Have they returned?
- No.

295
00:43:50,964 --> 00:43:56,553
- When will the wave hit it?
- In four minutes, 40 seconds.

296
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:14,321
Soran, transmit your co-ordinates.

297
00:44:28,585 --> 00:44:31,463
What the hell's he doing?

298
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:36,802
- You have two minutes left.
- You hear that, Soran?

299
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:41,265
We've got a level 12 shock wave
coming in. We must get out of here!

300
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:49,690
Sir, a Klingon "Bird of Prey"
is de-cloaking off the port bow.

301
00:45:03,912 --> 00:45:10,544
- Data, see if you can get to Geordi.
- I cannot, sir.

302
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,716
Report for transport.

303
00:45:29,479 --> 00:45:34,234
- Commander Riker's team is aboard.
- Warp one, engage!

304
00:45:47,623 --> 00:45:50,626
You've done it, Soran.

305
00:45:57,216 --> 00:45:59,760
Wait!

306
00:46:13,857 --> 00:46:19,279
I hope for your sake
you were initiating a mating ritual.

307
00:46:19,488 --> 00:46:24,701
You got careless. The Romulans
came looking for their trilithium.

308
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:29,998
Impossible. We left no survivors
on their outpost.

309
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:36,213
If the Enterprise hadn't intervened,
they'd have found it at the observatory.

310
00:46:36,421 --> 00:46:41,426
They didn't find it! And now
we have a weapon of unlimited power.

311
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:47,766
No, Lursa. I have the weapon,
and if you want me to give it to you, -

312
00:46:47,975 --> 00:46:53,021
- I would advise you to be
a little more careful in the future.

313
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,733
Perhaps we are tired of waiting.

314
00:46:56,942 --> 00:47:01,989
Without my research,
the trilithium is worthless.

315
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:08,412
As are your plans
to re-conquer the Klingon Empire.

316
00:47:12,875 --> 00:47:17,629
Set course for the Veridian system.
Maximum warp.

317
00:47:23,927 --> 00:47:29,141
He's an El Aurian. Over 300 years old.
He lost his entire family -

318
00:47:29,391 --> 00:47:35,814
- when the Borg destroyed his planet.
He escaped aboard the ship "Lakul".

319
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:40,027
That ship was later destroyed
by an energy ribbon.

320
00:47:40,235 --> 00:47:44,406
But Soran and 46 others were
rescued by the Enterprise-B.

321
00:47:44,615 --> 00:47:49,453
- That was when James Kirk was killed.
- I checked the Lakul's passenger list.

322
00:47:49,661 --> 00:47:53,499
Guess who else was on board?

323
00:47:55,709 --> 00:48:01,298
- I haven't thought of Soran in ages.
- You remember him?

324
00:48:03,509 --> 00:48:08,597
Guinan, you must tell me
everything that you know.

325
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:14,394
We think Soran has developed
a terrible weapon -

326
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:17,356
- with enough power to destroy...

327
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:23,862
Soran doesn't care about weapons.
He just wants to get back to the nexus.

328
00:48:24,071 --> 00:48:27,825
What the nexus?

329
00:48:28,033 --> 00:48:34,832
The energy ribbon was not a random
phenomenon travelling through space.

330
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:39,336
It's a doorway to another place
that we call the nexus.

331
00:48:39,586 --> 00:48:43,215
A place I've tried hard to forget.

332
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:53,725
What happened to you?

333
00:48:56,353 --> 00:49:00,524
It was like being inside joy.

334
00:49:00,732 --> 00:49:07,656
As if joy was a blanket
you could wrap yourself up in.

335
00:49:07,865 --> 00:49:12,911
Never in my entire life
have I ever been as content.

336
00:49:14,121 --> 00:49:19,459
- And then you were beamed away.
- Pulled. Ripped away.

337
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:27,509
None of us wanted to go. I would
have done anything to get back there.

338
00:49:30,888 --> 00:49:34,474
But I realised it wasn't possible.

339
00:49:34,683 --> 00:49:41,982
- What about Soran?
- If he's still obsessed, he's dangerous.

340
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:45,277
Why would he destroy a star?

341
00:49:50,365 --> 00:49:53,660
Thank you, Guinan.

342
00:49:55,662 --> 00:50:02,294
If you go,
you're not going to care about anything.

343
00:50:03,337 --> 00:50:11,011
Not this ship, not Soran, nothing.
You'll just want to stay in the nexus.

344
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:18,602
And you're not going
to want to come back.

345
00:50:31,657 --> 00:50:37,788
Marvellous technology. This is
a remarkable piece of equipment.

346
00:50:37,996 --> 00:50:44,670
- I'm glad you approve.
- Not very stylish, though.

347
00:50:46,588 --> 00:50:52,469
Have you ever considered a prosthesis
that would make you look...

348
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,764
...more normal?

349
00:50:55,973 --> 00:51:01,979
- What's normal?
- That's a good question.

350
00:51:02,187 --> 00:51:06,692
Normal is what everyone else is
and you are not.

351
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:14,158
Get down to it. What do you want?

352
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:19,329
As you may be aware,
I am an El Aurian.

353
00:51:19,580 --> 00:51:23,792
We are a race of listeners. We listen.

354
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:30,132
Right now you have
my complete attention.

355
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:35,220
I want to listen to everything
you know about trilithium.

356
00:51:39,308 --> 00:51:42,561
Captain's log, Stardate 48632.4.

357
00:51:42,769 --> 00:51:48,484
Data's emotion chip has been fused
into his neural net.

358
00:51:48,692 --> 00:51:53,906
However, he is fit for duty and is
joining me in Stellar Cartography.

359
00:51:55,199 --> 00:51:59,411
The ribbon is a conflux
of temporal energy -

360
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:03,916
- which travels through here
every 39.1 years.

361
00:52:04,124 --> 00:52:07,794
It will pass through this sector
in 42 hours.

362
00:52:08,003 --> 00:52:12,799
Guinan was right. Soran is
trying to get back to the ribbon.

363
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:17,137
What's the connection
with the Amargosa star?

364
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:23,769
Give me a list of anything that was
affected by the star's destruction.

365
00:52:23,977 --> 00:52:28,190
- Data?
- Sorry, sir.

366
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:35,823
It will take the computer a few
moments to compile the information.

367
00:52:37,407 --> 00:52:42,204
Data, are you all right?

368
00:52:43,372 --> 00:52:49,711
No, sir. I am finding it
difficult to concentrate.

369
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,717
I am overwhelmed
with feelings of remorse...

370
00:52:55,926 --> 00:53:01,682
...regret concerning my actions
at the observatory.

371
00:53:01,932 --> 00:53:09,940
I wanted to save Geordi, but
experienced something unexpected.

372
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:17,030
Fear. I was afraid.

373
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:26,456
The destruction of the star has had
the following effects in this sector.

374
00:53:26,665 --> 00:53:31,295
Gamma emissions
have increased by.05%.

375
00:53:31,545 --> 00:53:36,550
The starship Bozeman altered course.
Ambient magnetic fields...

376
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:40,179
Wait. Why would the Bozeman
alter course?

377
00:53:40,387 --> 00:53:45,517
The destruction of the star has altered
the gravitational forces in the sector.

378
00:53:45,726 --> 00:53:51,064
Any ship passing through would have
to make a minor course correction.

379
00:53:51,273 --> 00:53:56,695
Minor course correction...
Where's the ribbon now?

380
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:10,042
- This is its current position.
- Can you project its course?

381
00:54:13,712 --> 00:54:16,882
Captain...

382
00:54:19,551 --> 00:54:26,642
I can't go on. I wish to be deactivated
until the emotion chip can be removed.

383
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:34,066
- Are you having a malfunction?
- No, I just can't control these emotions.

384
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:39,947
I have nothing but sympathy for what
you are feeling, but right now...

385
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:46,286
I no longer want these emotions!
Deactivating me is the only solution.

386
00:54:46,495 --> 00:54:53,126
Part of having feelings is learning
to live with them, Data.

387
00:54:53,335 --> 00:54:57,548
You will not be deactivated.

388
00:54:57,756 --> 00:55:04,221
I require you to perform your duty
as an officer. That is an order!

389
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,436
I will try, sir.

390
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:22,197
Sometimes it takes courage to try.
Courage can be an emotion, too.

391
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:28,620
- Can you project the ribbon's course?
- I believe so.

392
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:36,003
Enhance Grid 9-A.

393
00:55:37,504 --> 00:55:41,258
Where was the Amargosa star?

394
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:48,390
The destruction of the star affected
the gravitational forces in this sector.

395
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,686
Did the computer project
the ribbon's course accordingly?

396
00:55:52,895 --> 00:55:57,858
No, sir. I'll make
the appropriate adjustments.

397
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:02,863
Soran's changing
the course of the ribbon.

398
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:10,829
But why change its path?
Why not fly into it with a ship?

399
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:18,253
Every ship that has approached the
ribbon has been destroyed or damaged.

400
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:24,426
He's trying to make the ribbon
come to him.

401
00:56:24,635 --> 00:56:30,807
- Does it pass any M-class planets?
- Yes, sir.

402
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:37,773
- There are two in the Veridian system.
- Veridian 3 isn't close enough.

403
00:56:37,981 --> 00:56:46,031
Would the ribbon's course be affected
if Soran destroyed the Veridian star?

404
00:56:50,953 --> 00:56:53,789
That's where he's going.

405
00:56:54,039 --> 00:56:58,836
The collapse of the Veridian star
would produce a shock wave -

406
00:56:59,044 --> 00:57:02,089
- similar to the one at Amargosa.

407
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:07,094
Destroying all planets in this system.

408
00:57:07,302 --> 00:57:10,639
Veridian 3 is uninhabited.

409
00:57:10,848 --> 00:57:15,060
However, Veridian 4 supports
a pre-industrial humanoid society.

410
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:18,564
Population?

411
00:57:18,772 --> 00:57:23,485
230 million, sir.

412
00:57:24,444 --> 00:57:31,034
Picard to bridge. Set a course for
the Veridian system, maximum warp.

413
00:57:55,267 --> 00:58:01,982
- Did you get anything from the human?
- No. His heart just wasn't in it.

414
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:08,280
We have entered orbit
of Veridian 3.

415
00:58:08,489 --> 00:58:15,496
- Prepare to transport me there.
- When do we get our payment?

416
00:58:23,337 --> 00:58:29,176
This contains all the information
you need to make a trilithium weapon.

417
00:58:29,426 --> 00:58:34,765
It's been coded.
Once I'm safely to the surface, -

418
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:39,478
- I'll transmit the decryption
sequence to you.

419
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:44,650
- A Federation starship is approaching.
- What? On viewer.

420
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:51,448
- They're hailing us.
- They can't see us.

421
00:58:51,657 --> 00:58:58,413
Klingon vessel. We'll crush any probe
launched toward the Veridian star.

422
00:58:58,622 --> 00:59:03,001
Return our chief engineer
and leave this system immediately.

423
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:06,505
There's no time for this.
Eliminate them.

424
00:59:06,755 --> 00:59:10,843
That's a galaxy class starship.
We're no match for them.

425
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:17,391
It's time we gave
Mr LaForge his sight back.

426
00:59:25,649 --> 00:59:28,944
Maybe they're not out there.

427
00:59:29,153 --> 00:59:34,575
They're trying to decide if a 20-year-old
Klingon ship can beat our flagship.

428
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:38,203
Perhaps they're on the surface.

429
00:59:38,453 --> 00:59:42,749
A solar probe launched
from the Klingon ship or the planet -

430
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:47,546
- will reach the sun in 11 seconds.
Since we don't have a point of origin -

431
00:59:47,754 --> 00:59:54,678
- it'll take us 8-15 seconds
to lock our weapons onto it.

432
00:59:54,887 --> 00:59:59,433
- When will the ribbon arrive?
- In 47 minutes.

433
00:59:59,641 --> 01:00:06,398
- We must get to Soran.
- Klingon vessel de-cloaking ahead.

434
01:00:10,319 --> 01:00:14,114
- They are hailing.
- On screen.

435
01:00:14,364 --> 01:00:20,496
- What an unexpected pleasure.
- I must speak with Soran.

436
01:00:20,704 --> 01:00:23,707
He is no longer aboard our ship.

437
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:29,379
- Then I will beam to his location.
- The doctor values his privacy.

438
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:34,051
He would be alarmed if
an armed away team interrupted him.

439
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:40,182
- Then I'll beam to your ship.
- They might kill you.

440
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:46,688
- Your engineer is a guest of ours.
- Then return him!

441
01:00:46,939 --> 01:00:51,068
- In exchange for what?
- Me, sir.

442
01:00:51,276 --> 01:00:58,617
Me. I'll be your prisoner. But first
beam me to where Soran is.

443
01:00:58,826 --> 01:01:05,415
The captain would make
a much more valuable hostage.

444
01:01:06,416 --> 01:01:12,422
- We'll consider it a prisoner exchange.
- Agreed.

445
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:17,803
Have Dr Crusher meet me
in Transporter Room 3.

446
01:01:23,350 --> 01:01:27,813
- Receiving the co-ordinates.
- Energise.

447
01:02:02,931 --> 01:02:06,685
Welcome, Captain.

448
01:02:14,151 --> 01:02:19,656
- You must think me a madman.
- The thought had crossed my mind.

449
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:25,621
I know why you're here. You're not sure
you can shoot down my probe.

450
01:02:25,871 --> 01:02:31,960
So you've come to dissuade me
from my horrific plan. Good luck.

451
01:02:33,086 --> 01:02:38,008
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm rather busy.

452
01:02:38,217 --> 01:02:40,844
Soran...

453
01:02:47,351 --> 01:02:52,981
That's a 50-gigawatt force field.
I wouldn't want to see you get hurt.

454
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:59,154
- I have established the link.
- Put it on viewer.

455
01:03:00,656 --> 01:03:04,827
It's working. The visor's transmitting.

456
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:07,287
Where is he?

457
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:20,759
Human females are so repulsive.

458
01:03:20,968 --> 01:03:25,264
There's myocardial degeneration.
I've removed the nano-probe -

459
01:03:25,472 --> 01:03:31,979
- and you'll be fine.
I need to run some more tests.

460
01:03:35,274 --> 01:03:41,029
- Data, it's okay.
- I am sorry I let you down.

461
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:46,910
- I have not been behaving like myself.
- No, you haven't.

462
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:51,748
You've been behaving like a human.

463
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:14,980
Don't do it. We can find another way
of getting you into this nexus.

464
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:20,194
I've spent 80 years
looking for another way.

465
01:04:20,402 --> 01:04:24,198
Believe me, this is the only one.

466
01:04:29,495 --> 01:04:34,625
What you're doing is just as bad as
when the Borg destroyed your world.

467
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:42,299
They killed millions, too.
Including your wife and children.

468
01:04:48,764 --> 01:04:52,392
Nice try.

469
01:04:56,522 --> 01:05:03,320
There was a time when I wouldn't
hurt a fly. Then the Borg came.

470
01:05:03,529 --> 01:05:10,536
They showed me that there is
one constant in this universe... death.

471
01:05:11,912 --> 01:05:19,753
We're all going to die sometime.
It's just a question of how and when.

472
01:05:19,962 --> 01:05:26,510
You will too, Captain. Aren't you
beginning to feel time gaining on you?

473
01:05:29,680 --> 01:05:34,101
Like a predator, it's stalking you.

474
01:05:35,936 --> 01:05:41,191
You can try and outrun it with doctors,
medicines, new technologies, -

475
01:05:41,441 --> 01:05:46,530
- but time will hunt you down
and make the kill.

476
01:05:46,738 --> 01:05:51,618
Our mortality defines us.
It's part of the truth of our existence.

477
01:05:55,247 --> 01:06:00,878
- I found a new truth.
- The nexus?

478
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:06,383
Time has no meaning there.
The predator has no teeth.

479
01:06:09,052 --> 01:06:14,725
- Where is he now?
- He bathed. Now he's roaming the ship.

480
01:06:15,726 --> 01:06:20,397
He's the only engineer in Starfleet
who doesn't go to Engineering.

481
01:06:20,606 --> 01:06:25,319
- Any luck?
- I cannot locate the captain.

482
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:32,951
The sensors can't reach the planet.
Can you scan for life forms?

483
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:39,791
I'd be happy to, sir. I just love
scanning for life forms.

484
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:44,254
Life forms...

485
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:48,008
you tiny little life forms

486
01:06:48,258 --> 01:06:53,972
you precious little life forms
where are you?

487
01:07:02,105 --> 01:07:03,232
Finally.

488
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:10,239
I'll run a diagnostic on the port plasma
relays. The generator's fluctuating.

489
01:07:10,447 --> 01:07:12,616
Fine.

490
01:07:24,044 --> 01:07:27,297
That's it!
Replay from time index 924.

491
01:07:33,804 --> 01:07:36,140
Magnify this section and enhance.

492
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:49,069
- Shield modulation: 257.4.
- Adjust torpedo frequency to match.

493
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:04,334
- They've penetrated our shields.
- Lock phasers and return fire!

494
01:08:12,050 --> 01:08:17,514
- Take the helm. Get us out of orbit!
- Hull breach on decks 31-35.

495
01:08:23,604 --> 01:08:29,860
- Any weaknesses in that old ship?
- It's a Class D-12 Bird of Prey.

496
01:08:30,068 --> 01:08:35,032
- Notorious for defective plasma coils.
- Can we take advantage of that?

497
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,661
I don't see how. The plasma coil
is part of their cloaking device.

498
01:08:45,375 --> 01:08:49,796
Get a stabiliser on that conduit.

499
01:08:50,005 --> 01:08:54,426
Reinforce starboard interlock. Re-route
power through secondary coupling.

500
01:08:54,843 --> 01:09:00,015
Data, would a defective plasma coil
be susceptible to an ionic pulse?

501
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:07,564
Yes, it might reset the coil and trigger
their cloaking device. Excellent idea!

502
01:09:09,066 --> 01:09:13,654
- Then their shields will drop.
- They'll be vulnerable for two seconds.

503
01:09:13,862 --> 01:09:17,866
- Lock on the plasma coil.
- No problem.

504
01:09:20,327 --> 01:09:25,082
- Our shields are holding.
- Fire at will.

505
01:09:25,290 --> 01:09:30,712
Prepare a spread of photon torpedoes.
We must hit them when they cloak.

506
01:09:30,921 --> 01:09:33,674
Target their primary reactor.

507
01:09:38,887 --> 01:09:43,517
- I'm initiating ionic pulse.
- Make it quick!

508
01:09:52,776 --> 01:09:57,072
- Target their bridge.
- We are cloaking.

509
01:09:57,281 --> 01:10:00,951
Our shields are down!

510
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:05,080
Fire!

511
01:10:37,029 --> 01:10:38,739
Yes!

512
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:25,953
Haven't you got anything better to do?

513
01:12:07,327 --> 01:12:13,917
It must have been that last torpedo.
It ruptured the magnetic interlocks.

514
01:12:18,130 --> 01:12:23,635
Coolant leak!
Let's get out of here. Move!

515
01:12:26,763 --> 01:12:32,186
Bridge, we're five minutes
from a warp core breach.

516
01:12:34,062 --> 01:12:40,402
Evacuate everyone to the saucer
section. Prepare to separate the ship.

517
01:12:43,864 --> 01:12:47,868
Starship separation in five minutes.

518
01:13:04,092 --> 01:13:07,805
Let's move him out.

519
01:13:10,474 --> 01:13:14,186
Starship separation in 4 minutes,
30 seconds.

520
01:13:20,150 --> 01:13:24,988
Starship separation in 4 minutes,
15 seconds.

521
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:28,909
Farrell!

522
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:32,955
Get these kids to the W-tube.
We'll find the parents later.

523
01:13:35,499 --> 01:13:37,918
Starship separation in four minutes.

524
01:14:07,865 --> 01:14:10,450
You'll have to excuse me.

525
01:14:10,659 --> 01:14:15,831
I have an appointment with eternity
and I don't want to be late.

526
01:14:31,805 --> 01:14:36,393
The core breach is accelerating.
We must get out.

527
01:14:36,602 --> 01:14:40,939
- We're all out.
- One minute to warp core breach.

528
01:14:41,148 --> 01:14:45,611
Begin separation sequence.
Full impulse power once we're clear.

529
01:15:00,584 --> 01:15:05,923
Separation complete.
Core breach in progress.

530
01:15:13,347 --> 01:15:17,935
Primary stabilisers off-line.
Engaging secondary systems.

531
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:25,984
- Report!
- Helm controls are off-line!

532
01:15:31,865 --> 01:15:34,284
Oh, shit...

533
01:16:38,765 --> 01:16:43,979
I've re-routed auxiliary power
to lateral thrusters to level our descent.

534
01:16:44,855 --> 01:16:46,857
Brace for impact!

535
01:16:49,943 --> 01:16:54,740
- Hold on tight.
- Hold their heads.

536
01:18:44,808 --> 01:18:48,145
I'm okay.

537
01:22:18,230 --> 01:22:22,776
What is this? Where am I?

538
01:22:39,042 --> 01:22:42,212
- Surprise!
- We love you, Father.

539
01:22:42,462 --> 01:22:47,509
- Were you scared?
- I helped decorate the tree.

540
01:22:47,718 --> 01:22:52,681
- Say Merry Christmas, Papa.
- I love you, Father.

541
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:58,479
Move back
and give your father some room.

542
01:23:10,073 --> 01:23:15,913
- Cup of Earl Grey?
- That would be perfect.

543
01:23:22,336 --> 01:23:27,132
- This one's for you.
- Thank you, Rene.

544
01:23:27,341 --> 01:23:33,472
- Merry Christmas, Uncle.
- Rene, can you help me with the table?

545
01:23:34,223 --> 01:23:36,934
Rene!

546
01:23:37,935 --> 01:23:40,103
Come here.

547
01:23:56,161 --> 01:24:00,332
Go help your aunt.

548
01:25:39,348 --> 01:25:44,436
This isn't right. This can't be real.

549
01:25:44,645 --> 01:25:52,611
- It's as real as you want it to be.
- Guinan. What's going on?

550
01:25:52,820 --> 01:25:57,825
- Why am I here?
- You're in the nexus.

551
01:25:58,033 --> 01:26:03,831
- This is the nexus?
- For you. This is what you wanted.

552
01:26:04,081 --> 01:26:09,711
But... I never had a home like this.

553
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:17,636
Nor a wife and children.
But these are all mine.

554
01:26:20,222 --> 01:26:25,936
What are you doing here? I thought
you were aboard the Enterprise.

555
01:26:26,145 --> 01:26:34,570
I am. I'm also here. Think of me
as an echo of the person you know.

556
01:26:34,778 --> 01:26:40,909
- A part of herself she left behind.
- When the Enterprise-B saved you...

557
01:26:41,743 --> 01:26:46,915
- Help me build my castle.
- I will in a few minutes.

558
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:54,590
Papa, thank you for the dolly.
She's very beautiful.

559
01:26:57,259 --> 01:27:02,431
These are my children...
These are my children!

560
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:08,937
Of course. Time has no meaning here.
You can go back and see them born, -

561
01:27:09,188 --> 01:27:14,276
- or go forward
and see your grandchildren.

562
01:27:14,485 --> 01:27:17,446
Dinner's ready.

563
01:27:21,658 --> 01:27:24,328
Dinner's ready, Papa.

564
01:27:53,649 --> 01:27:58,403
Go on. Go on without me.

565
01:28:17,881 --> 01:28:23,512
- Guinan, can I leave the nexus?
- Where would you go?

566
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:28,225
- I don't understand.
- Time has no meaning here.

567
01:28:28,433 --> 01:28:34,690
- You can go anywhere, any time.
- I know where.

568
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:41,029
To the mountaintop on Veridian 3
just before Soran destroyed the star.

569
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:49,121
- Come back and help me stop him.
- I can't leave. I'm there already.

570
01:28:49,371 --> 01:28:51,206
But I know someone who can.

571
01:28:53,917 --> 01:28:57,546
And from his point of view,
he just got here, too.

572
01:29:06,096 --> 01:29:11,351
Kirk...
James T. Kirk.

573
01:29:16,482 --> 01:29:19,318
Beautiful day.

574
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:24,823
Yes, it certainly is.

575
01:29:31,205 --> 01:29:34,458
Would you mind?

576
01:29:43,300 --> 01:29:47,679
Captain, I'm wondering,
do you realise?

577
01:29:47,888 --> 01:29:53,143
Hold on.
Do you smell something burning?

578
01:30:01,693 --> 01:30:07,199
Looks like somebody was trying
to cook some eggs. Come on in.

579
01:30:08,700 --> 01:30:12,663
It's all right. It's my house.

580
01:30:15,332 --> 01:30:20,546
At least it used to be.
I sold it years ago.

581
01:30:22,297 --> 01:30:27,970
I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard
of the Starship... Enterprise.

582
01:30:31,181 --> 01:30:34,101
The clock...

583
01:30:37,104 --> 01:30:39,148
I gave this clock to Bones.

584
01:30:39,356 --> 01:30:46,321
I'm from what you would consider
the future. The 24th century.

585
01:30:48,949 --> 01:30:52,077
Butler!

586
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:04,214
How can you be here?
He's been dead seven years.

587
01:31:04,423 --> 01:31:09,887
Jim, I'm starving. How long are you
going to rattle around in that kitchen?

588
01:31:10,095 --> 01:31:12,973
Antonia.

589
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:21,023
What are you talking about?
The future?

590
01:31:21,231 --> 01:31:27,196
This is the past. Nine years ago.

591
01:31:42,628 --> 01:31:48,175
The day I told her
I was going back to Starfleet.

592
01:31:57,434 --> 01:32:03,857
Ktarian eggs, her favourite. I was
preparing them to soften the blow.

593
01:32:04,066 --> 01:32:09,947
I know how real this must seem
to you. But it's not.

594
01:32:10,155 --> 01:32:16,411
This isn't really your house. We're
caught up in some temporal nexus.

595
01:32:19,039 --> 01:32:24,962
Dill. Dill weed.
In the cabinet, second shelf to the left.

596
01:32:25,963 --> 01:32:29,758
Behind the oregano.

597
01:32:35,389 --> 01:32:39,518
- How long have you been here?
- I don't know.

598
01:32:39,726 --> 01:32:46,275
I was aboard the Enterprise-B in
the deflector control room... Stir these.

599
01:32:46,483 --> 01:32:51,196
The bulkhead disappeared and then I
found myself out there chopping wood -

600
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:56,451
- right before you walked up
Thanks.

601
01:32:56,660 --> 01:33:01,081
Look, history records -

602
01:33:01,290 --> 01:33:08,255
- that you died saving the Enterprise-B
from an energy ribbon 80 years ago.

603
01:33:08,464 --> 01:33:11,216
This is the 24th century?

604
01:33:13,010 --> 01:33:17,014
- And I'm dead?
- No, this is some kind of...

605
01:33:17,222 --> 01:33:23,562
...temporal nexus.
Something is missing.

606
01:33:29,193 --> 01:33:34,907
I need your help.
Leave the nexus with me.

607
01:33:35,115 --> 01:33:39,912
We have to go back to Veridian 3
and stop a man called Soran -

608
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:45,542
- from destroying a star.
Millions of lives are at stake.

609
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:49,880
History considers me dead.
Who am I to argue with history?

610
01:33:50,088 --> 01:33:53,717
- You have a duty as a Starfleet officer!
- Don't lecture me.

611
01:33:53,926 --> 01:33:58,597
I saved the galaxy
when your grandfather was in diapers.

612
01:33:58,806 --> 01:34:03,769
Besides,
I think the galaxy owes me one.

613
01:34:05,479 --> 01:34:08,857
All right...

614
01:34:10,859 --> 01:34:17,366
I was like you once. Completely
blinded by duty and obligation.

615
01:34:19,368 --> 01:34:25,207
And what did it get me?
An empty house.

616
01:34:30,212 --> 01:34:33,632
Not this time.

617
01:34:33,841 --> 01:34:38,470
This time I'm going to march
into that bedroom -

618
01:34:38,679 --> 01:34:45,018
- and tell Antonia I want to marry her.
This time it's going to be different.

619
01:35:13,213 --> 01:35:18,010
- This is not your bedroom.
- No, it's better.

620
01:35:18,218 --> 01:35:22,764
- Better?
- This is my uncle's barn in Idaho.

621
01:35:22,973 --> 01:35:29,313
I took this horse out for a ride
11 years ago on a spring day.

622
01:35:33,108 --> 01:35:39,198
Like this one. If I'm right,
this is the day I met Antonia.

623
01:35:39,406 --> 01:35:46,580
This nexus is very clever. I can start
over and do things right from day one.

624
01:37:23,510 --> 01:37:27,848
I must have jumped that 50 times.
Scared the hell out of me each time.

625
01:37:28,056 --> 01:37:31,059
Except this time.

626
01:37:31,268 --> 01:37:34,605
Because it isn't real.

627
01:37:37,858 --> 01:37:42,571
- Antonia.
- She isn't real either, is she?

628
01:37:42,779 --> 01:37:47,034
Nothing here is.
Nothing here matters.

629
01:37:48,243 --> 01:37:56,251
Maybe this is more about that empty
chair on the bridge of the Enterprise.

630
01:37:56,460 --> 01:38:02,633
Ever since I left Starfleet
I haven't made a difference.

631
01:38:12,601 --> 01:38:18,565
Captain of the Enterprise?
Close to retirement?

632
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:22,152
- I'm not planning on it.
- Don't.

633
01:38:22,361 --> 01:38:27,366
Don't let them promote or transfer you.
Don't let them do anything -

634
01:38:27,574 --> 01:38:32,955
- that takes you off that ship. Because
there you can make a difference.

635
01:38:34,331 --> 01:38:39,461
Come back and help me stop Soran.
Make a difference again.

636
01:38:51,390 --> 01:38:55,519
Who am I to argue with
the captain of the Enterprise?

637
01:38:55,727 --> 01:39:01,733
Veridian 3? I take it the odds are
against us and the situation is grim.

638
01:39:01,942 --> 01:39:05,487
You could say that.

639
01:39:05,696 --> 01:39:11,076
Spock would say I was
an irrational, illogical human being -

640
01:39:11,285 --> 01:39:15,122
- for taking on a mission like that.

641
01:39:16,248 --> 01:39:19,877
Sounds like fun.

642
01:39:33,390 --> 01:39:37,936
I've re-routed auxiliary power
to lateral thrusters to level our descent.

643
01:39:38,145 --> 01:39:40,439
Brace for impact!

644
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:28,946
- Just who the hell are you?
- He's James T. Kirk.

645
01:40:29,154 --> 01:40:32,783
Don't you read history?

646
01:40:36,328 --> 01:40:39,623
I've got to get to the launcher.

647
01:40:39,832 --> 01:40:44,128
- The ribbon will be here in a minute.
- I'll take care of Soran.

648
01:41:20,372 --> 01:41:25,961
Actually, I am familiar with history.
If I'm not mistaken, you're dead.

649
01:42:09,797 --> 01:42:14,384
- Weren't you heading for the launcher?
- I changed my mind.

650
01:42:38,283 --> 01:42:40,410
We need that control pad.

651
01:42:46,875 --> 01:42:49,211
Captain, look.

652
01:42:51,046 --> 01:42:54,591
Where's Soran?

653
01:43:57,029 --> 01:44:02,743
We're running out of time. The
control pad is still on the other side.

654
01:44:02,951 --> 01:44:07,581
- I'll get it. You go for the launcher.
- No, we have to work together.

655
01:44:07,789 --> 01:44:12,169
- We are working together. Trust me.
- Good luck, Captain.

656
01:44:12,377 --> 01:44:15,756
Call me Jim.

657
01:45:48,182 --> 01:45:53,604
Picard! Get away from that launcher.

658
01:45:57,191 --> 01:46:00,444
Now!

659
01:47:36,039 --> 01:47:41,170
Did we do it?
Did we make a difference?

660
01:47:42,379 --> 01:47:48,135
Oh, yes. We made a difference.
Thank you.

661
01:47:51,722 --> 01:47:57,895
It's the least I could do...
for the captain of the Enterprise.

662
01:48:05,861 --> 01:48:10,908
It was... fun.

663
01:48:21,877 --> 01:48:25,130
Oh, my.

664
01:49:47,212 --> 01:49:49,548
Captain's log, Stardate 48650. 1.

665
01:49:49,756 --> 01:49:55,387
Three Starfleet vessels have come
to beam up the Enterprise survivors.

666
01:49:55,596 --> 01:50:01,685
Our casualties were light, bt the
Enterprise herself can't be salvaged.

667
01:50:01,894 --> 01:50:08,233
- It has been extremely difficult.
- Then why not have the chip removed?

668
01:50:08,442 --> 01:50:13,655
At first, I was unprepared for the
unpredictable nature of emotions.

669
01:50:13,906 --> 01:50:18,577
However, having experienced
261 emotional states, -

670
01:50:18,785 --> 01:50:24,500
- I believe I have learned to control
my feelings. They won't control me.

671
01:50:24,708 --> 01:50:28,504
I hope you're successful.

672
01:50:28,712 --> 01:50:31,840
Data, I found something.

673
01:50:32,758 --> 01:50:35,928
One life sign, very faint.

674
01:50:48,816 --> 01:50:52,319
Spot!

675
01:50:52,528 --> 01:50:56,907
I'm very happy to see you, Spot.

676
01:50:58,951 --> 01:51:03,831
Another family reunited.

677
01:51:04,832 --> 01:51:10,087
Data, are you all right?

678
01:51:10,295 --> 01:51:15,342
I am uncertain, Councillor.
I am happy to see Spot, -

679
01:51:15,592 --> 01:51:22,307
- yet I am crying.
Perhaps the chip is malfunctioning.

680
01:51:24,601 --> 01:51:28,730
I think it's working perfectly.

681
01:51:34,236 --> 01:51:36,113
Hello, Spot.

682
01:51:42,661 --> 01:51:45,664
Is this it?

683
01:51:45,873 --> 01:51:51,295
Yes, that's it, Number One.
Thank you.

684
01:51:56,300 --> 01:52:02,181
I'm going to miss this ship.
She went before her time.

685
01:52:03,724 --> 01:52:09,480
Someone once said that time is
a predator that stalks us all our lives.

686
01:52:09,688 --> 01:52:14,735
I believe that time is a companion
who goes with us on the journey -

687
01:52:14,943 --> 01:52:21,033
- and reminds us to cherish every
moment, for they'll never come again.

688
01:52:24,203 --> 01:52:29,416
What we leave behind is not
as important as how we've lived.

689
01:52:29,666 --> 01:52:33,670
After all, we're only mortal.

690
01:52:33,879 --> 01:52:39,176
Speak for yourself, sir.
I plan to live forever.

691
01:52:42,429 --> 01:52:47,392
I always thought I'd get a shot
at this chair one day.

692
01:52:47,601 --> 01:52:50,020
Perhaps you still will.

693
01:52:50,229 --> 01:52:55,943
I doubt this will be the last ship
to carry the name Enterprise.

694
01:53:03,450 --> 01:53:08,330
Picard to Farragut.
Two to beam up.
