1
00:00:00,334 --> 00:00:03,602
(tense eerie music)

2
00:00:55,523 --> 00:00:56,822
- Fucking hell.

3
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,258
- Chill out man.

4
00:01:09,403 --> 00:01:12,871
- [Uday] Where
       the fuck is Frank?

5
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:16,175
Fucking piece of
     scouse, fucking shit.

6
00:01:16,177 --> 00:01:18,110
(screaming)

7
00:01:18,112 --> 00:01:20,879
Where the fuck is he?

8
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:23,482
Tell me, where is Frank?

9
00:01:23,484 --> 00:01:25,884
(screaming)

10
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:28,887
(shutter rattling)

11
00:01:28,889 --> 00:01:31,423
Bring my fucking
    nephew and that fucking

12
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:32,791
nitwit friend of his in.

13
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,294
- Don't say anything
          stupid yeah.

14
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:37,529
(screaming)

15
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:50,142
(ball bouncing)

16
00:01:52,513 --> 00:01:53,345
- Please.

17
00:01:58,619 --> 00:02:00,519
- Come on, give me one.

18
00:02:02,756 --> 00:02:04,289
(clapping)

19
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,859
Team work, makes the dream work.

20
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,462
- Fuck Sid.

21
00:02:17,905 --> 00:02:18,804
- Tariq.

22
00:02:21,876 --> 00:02:25,310
- Erm, moms been asking

24
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:32,351
(bone crunching)
      (screaming in pain)

25
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:34,553
- What?

26
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,490
- Did you get the
      jalebi she sent yah?

27
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:42,528

33
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,248

42
00:03:42,856 --> 00:03:47,492
You like cricket boys huh?

43
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:57,569
(loud thumping)
           (grunting)

44
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:13,685
Strap him up, I
      need another wicket.

45
00:04:14,722 --> 00:04:17,656
- What, what you
     doing, what you doing?

46
00:04:17,658 --> 00:04:21,893
- Tariq, you don't have to do
 this, he doesn't know nothing.

47
00:04:21,895 --> 00:04:23,295
- I think he does.

48
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,330
- [Tariq] I swear
        on my moms life,

49
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,181
uncle you're not listening.

50
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,031
- You look a bit stumped

51
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,213
jalebi.
         - Telling you

52
00:04:30,214 --> 00:04:30,757
the fucking truth.

53
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:31,301
We don't know where
       your shit is yeah,

54
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:32,404
we don't know where
         your money is,

55
00:04:32,406 --> 00:04:33,739
and we don't know
        where Frank is.

56
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:34,973
Honestly uncle he
     doesn't know nothing,

57
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:37,075
he's, look he's
      thick, he's stupid,

58
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:39,845
there's custard where
     brains should be yeah.

59
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,382
- Well we'll find
       out now won't we?

60
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:46,351
Ball.

61
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,589
(screaming)

62
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,591
- Look honestly uncle
   look, we don't know where

63
00:04:52,593 --> 00:04:54,626
your shit is yeah, we don't
    know where your money is

64
00:04:54,628 --> 00:04:56,728
and we don't know
        where Frank is.

65
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,364
- [Boxy] Just tell
       us, tell us Frank.

66
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,732
- [Frank] Fuck off.

67
00:05:00,734 --> 00:05:02,334
- Tell us and we can go home.

68
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,669
- [Frank] I wouldn't tell you

69
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,003
if I had to kiss his
    fucking throbbing cock.

70
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,773
Well then you'd be at the front
  of the queue, wouldn't you?

71
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,409
Go on, go on.

72
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:12,978
- [Boxy] Frank, I'm telling
      you, don't say that.

73
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:15,047
You're supposed to talk.

74
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:20,452
- [Frank] You're a
     dumb bitch aren't you

75
00:05:20,454 --> 00:05:23,755
and you're loving it,
     mini knob, mini knob.

76
00:05:23,757 --> 00:05:24,923
- [Boxy] Don't talk about that.

77
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:28,660
I'll kill you, I'll
    kill you, I'll kill you.

78
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,849
- Fuck!

79
00:05:51,618 --> 00:05:53,618
Give us a week.

80
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:56,421
We'll find Frank and
     we'll find the money.

81
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,828
- You're not back here in
    four days with my money,

82
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:11,570
I'm gonna grind this
     so far up your crease,

83
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:15,040
you'll be chewing
      corn for breakfast.

84
00:06:15,042 --> 00:06:17,542
(grunting)

85
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:21,847
(tense music)

86
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,135
- What we gonna do?

87
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:47,806
How we gonna find
      Frank in four days?

88
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:52,677
Well it's gonna take
  longer than that, isn't it?

89
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,079
- You are one dumb piece of shit

90
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,781
aren't you, Boxy?

91
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,266
- Why?

92
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:58,750
- Because he's floating
    down the fucking canal.

93
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,918
- Well that's what I mean.

94
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,886
He could be anywhere.

95
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:02,788
He could be in Liverpool by now.

96
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,889
- [Tariq] I swear Boxy.

97
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,123
- What?

98
00:07:05,125 --> 00:07:08,059
- Shut up or I'm gonna
      bash your brains in.

99
00:07:09,563 --> 00:07:11,863
Is it this left or the next?

100
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:14,699
(upbeat music)

101
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,448
- Miss Moon,

102
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:30,882
my name is detective
    inspector Helen Wilkes.

103
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,250
I understand that you've
      got some information

104
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,986
concerning the Charles
        Sunday murders.

105
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,621
- Yes.

106
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,591
I know where Donna Brown
  and Kevin Smart are buried.

107
00:07:41,228 --> 00:07:42,661
- How can you possibly know

108
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:44,930
where the bodies of
      those children are?

109
00:07:44,932 --> 00:07:46,465
- Sunday told me.

110
00:07:48,235 --> 00:07:49,568
- Charles Sunday died

111
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:52,904
while you were sucking
        lollipops, love.

112
00:07:52,906 --> 00:07:55,140
- Have they told you?

113
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,908
I'm a psychic medium inspector.

114
00:07:58,745 --> 00:07:59,611
- Christ.

115
00:08:04,551 --> 00:08:05,817
Miss Moon, I suggest you leave

116
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,920
before I charge you with
      wasting police time.

117
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:11,623
- But I can lead you to
     where they're buried.

118
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:12,524
I can.

119
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,826
- We've spent years

120
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,829
crawling over the
     life of that sick man.

121
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,966
What could you possibly
      know that we don't?

122
00:08:24,905 --> 00:08:27,639
- He cut off their fingers
     after they were dead,

123
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,040
kept them in a shoe box.

124
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,877
You found 'em, didn't you,

125
00:08:32,813 --> 00:08:34,579
kept it from the families?

126
00:08:40,821 --> 00:08:41,953
- Wait there.

127
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:50,795
- Look, we're here
      to get information.

128
00:08:50,797 --> 00:08:52,297
Do not play happy families.

129
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,799
You get me?

130
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,667
- Yeah.

131
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:10,148
(doorbell ringing)

132
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,182
- Hello boys.

133
00:09:11,184 --> 00:09:12,617
- [Boxy] Hello.

134
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:14,653
- Great to see you,
      Boxy lad, come here.

135
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:18,023
Oh steady arm, Boxy,

136
00:09:18,025 --> 00:09:19,991
I thought you were
    going in for a smacker.

137
00:09:19,993 --> 00:09:20,959
- Leave it out, Tracey,

138
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,294
you're like my mother.

139
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:24,663
- I'm nothing like
      your mother darling

140
00:09:24,665 --> 00:09:26,164
but I appreciate the sentiment.

141
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,933
Go on through and
        stick kettle on.

142
00:09:31,838 --> 00:09:32,771
Off yourself Tariq,

143
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,339
in the AM take away.

144
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,991
Sorry about the Tariq, I forgot.

145
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,943
- [Tariq] It's fine.

146
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,894
- Here, let me roast up a
 nice cheese and tomato toast.

147
00:09:56,897 --> 00:09:58,063
- I'm not hungry, honestly.

148
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,631
- [Tracey] You should eat, lad.

149
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:00,966
- I do.

150
00:10:00,968 --> 00:10:02,968
- [Tracey] Know what
    Frank always says, Box?

151
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,802
Feed the body.

152
00:10:03,804 --> 00:10:04,970
- Feed the mind.

153
00:10:04,972 --> 00:10:05,837
- Right.

154
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,275
- I'm glad you
    mentioned Frank, Trace.

155
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:13,945
We wanted to ask

156
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:17,415
does he ever bring
         anything home?

157
00:10:17,417 --> 00:10:18,249
- What, like the clap?

158
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:19,117
What do you mean?

159
00:10:19,119 --> 00:10:20,785
- No, work stuff.

160
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,220
Does he bring work stuff home?

161
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:27,192
- Uh uh, no but I wish
    he'd bring himself home.

162
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:29,094
Lucy's missing him like mad.

163
00:10:29,096 --> 00:10:30,095
- [Boxy] Where is she?

164
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,896
- She's taken to her bed.

165
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:32,998
She won't eat,

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,666
she can't sleep.

167
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,967
- [Boxy] Oh that's terrible.

168
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,936
- I've tried making
     her favourite dinners,

169
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:40,071
taking her to get
        her nails done.

170
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:41,373
Nothing.

171
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,240
- Sorry Trace.

172
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,276
- She might come
        down in a minute

173
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,411
if she hears your voice.

174
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:52,017
- Does he have a shed Tracey,
 you know, a lock up somewhere?

175
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,818
- Why don't you ask Frank?

176
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,820
- He's away on business
        for a few days,

177
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,856
asked us to sort
     something out for him.

178
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,696
- I fancy a brew lads,

179
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:06,164
I won't be a sec.

180
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:13,104
- Stop fucking around.

181
00:11:13,106 --> 00:11:14,839
Start searching the house.

182
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:15,473
- What for?

183
00:11:15,475 --> 00:11:17,075
- Keys, anything.

184
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,043
Now go on, fuck off.

185
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:25,283
- I'm just gonna pop
   upstairs, Trish, see Lucy,

186
00:11:25,285 --> 00:11:27,152
see if I can cheer her up a bit.

187
00:11:27,154 --> 00:11:29,120
- [Trish] Alright love.

188
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:43,435
(coughing)

189
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,074
He's got a kind heart, has Boxy?

190
00:11:50,777 --> 00:11:51,843
- Yeah, he does.

191
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:55,747
- I'm glad me and Frank
    took him under our wing.

192
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:57,082
- Yeah, it's kind of you.

193
00:11:58,985 --> 00:11:59,984
So does--

194
00:11:59,986 --> 00:12:01,453
- I sometimes worry

195
00:12:01,455 --> 00:12:04,823
that folks take advantage
     of his simple nature.

196
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,394
But then I remember he's got
 my Frank covering his asshole

197
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:11,129
so he's bound to be alright.

198
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:17,235
He has got my Frank covering
 his asshole, ain't he, Tariq?

199
00:12:18,472 --> 00:12:19,804
- Yeah, course.

200
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:21,740
- Good.

201
00:12:23,143 --> 00:12:25,443
- We just want to know if he
 keeps stuff around the house.

202
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,147
- [Tracey] Frank never
     talks about his work.

203
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,381
- [Tariq] Why?

204
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,852
- He never brings anything home.

205
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,820
- [Tariq] Are you sure?

206
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,557
- And he'd never go
    away without telling me.

207
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:43,027
What the fuck's going on, Tariq?

208
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:46,197
(mysterious music)

209
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,054
(buzzing)

210
00:13:19,533 --> 00:13:22,967
(gunshot blasts)

211
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,937
(mysterious music)

212
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:39,150
- What'd you find?

213
00:13:39,152 --> 00:13:41,886
(tense music)

214
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:59,437
Why the fuck did you
      have to bring Lucy?

215
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:03,208
- She's all I got left
       now thanks to you.

216
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,142
- Tracey knew.

217
00:14:04,144 --> 00:14:05,376
She would've told the cops.

218
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,277
- No way.

219
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,949
- Or Uday after he used his
  cricket on her a few times.

220
00:14:16,156 --> 00:14:17,622
- Can we at least take
       Lucy out the boat?

221
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:19,357
- She's not crying, is she?

222
00:14:20,293 --> 00:14:21,459
Missing mommy and
        all that bugger.

223
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,260
Fuck that no way,

224
00:14:25,265 --> 00:14:25,897
not in my fucking car.

225
00:14:25,898 --> 00:14:26,530
Besides, you're the one
    that brought her along,

226
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:27,932
it's your responsibility.

227
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,234
It was up to me, I'd just.

228
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:33,137
- No chance, no chance.

229
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:44,983
- There's a box here.

230
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,384
We've got to get
      out of the country.

231
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,086
Bring your girlfriend,
     what's her name, Dawn?

232
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,254
Dawn, yeah?

233
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:51,055
Bring Dawn and Louise.

234
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,892
Can't take that shit.

235
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:55,426
- [Reporter] News, our
      headlines this hour.

236
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:58,463
Two bodies have been
   discovered on Baildonmoor.

237
00:14:58,465 --> 00:15:01,232
It's believed they're the
 Sunday school murder victims,

238
00:15:01,234 --> 00:15:03,601
Donna Brown and Kevin Smart.

239
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,503
Police are being
    assisted in their search

240
00:15:05,505 --> 00:15:08,206
by a Bradford woman, Alice Moon,

241
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:11,476
who controversially claims
   she can talk to the dead.

242
00:15:11,478 --> 00:15:12,410
In other news,

243
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:13,344
a leading drugs charity--

244
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:14,712
- You believe in all that?

245
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:16,247
- [Tariq] What?

246
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,918
- Do you believe in that...

247
00:15:20,987 --> 00:15:23,354
Life after death,
     spirits, when you die?

248
00:15:24,457 --> 00:15:25,490
- No way.

249
00:15:26,493 --> 00:15:27,458
It's all bullshit.

250
00:15:30,263 --> 00:15:32,263
- [Announcer] We're
   seeing a massive increase

251
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,965
in drugs coming
       in straight from.

252
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:36,634
- [Reporter] Kevin Smart.

253
00:15:36,636 --> 00:15:38,970
Police are being
    assisted in their search

254
00:15:38,972 --> 00:15:41,539
by a Bradford woman, Alice Moon.

255
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:51,616
- Kevin Smart and Donna Brown,

256
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:55,053
victims of notorious child
     killer Charles Sunday.

257
00:15:55,055 --> 00:15:57,689
- Ah babe, get packing
       babe, get packing.

258
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:59,390
- I'm working at a
     saloon tomorrow, Box.

259
00:15:59,392 --> 00:16:02,293
- You can get a saloon
   job when we get out there.

260
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:04,329
- Well how long
       are we going for?

261
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,129
- [Boxy] 20 years.

262
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,030
- What?

263
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,133
- Look,

264
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,336
we're gonna live out there.

265
00:16:11,338 --> 00:16:12,704
It's no big deal.

266
00:16:12,706 --> 00:16:14,072
- No big deal?

267
00:16:14,074 --> 00:16:17,175
- No, we fly out
      and we buy a house.

268
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:18,009
It's easy.

269
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,610
- What's happened, Boxy?

270
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,280
- Don't ask me what.

271
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,348
I can't tell you, babe.

272
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,516
- What about my
      friends and my mom?

273
00:16:25,518 --> 00:16:27,118
- You don't even like your mom.

274
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,519
- What about Tracey and Frank?

275
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,789
What about Tariq?

276
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,126
- Look,

277
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:37,195
don't worry about them.

278
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,563
It's you and me
       that I care about.

279
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:40,031
- This is mental,

280
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,432
surely you can see that.

281
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,501
- Mental is when
       you've got a bloke

282
00:16:43,503 --> 00:16:46,204
who wants to stick a
  cricket bat up your asshole.

283
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,273
Look, I've got to get
      away from here, Dawn

284
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:51,409
and I really want
      you to come with me.

285
00:17:17,037 --> 00:17:20,104
- The father are the kind
  that burnt you at the stake.

286
00:17:20,106 --> 00:17:22,573
- I just want to
      do the right thing,

287
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:24,509
bring closure to the families.

288
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,048
(tense music)

289
00:17:39,726 --> 00:17:44,796
- [Officer] Alice,
      I'm not buying this
     mumbo jumbo bullshit.

290
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:46,497
- Thanks for the lift.

291
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,567
- We'll be in touch.

292
00:17:52,806 --> 00:17:56,274
(church bells ringing)

293
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,081
(honking)

294
00:18:12,358 --> 00:18:15,093
(tense music)

295
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:26,237
(honking)

296
00:18:41,654 --> 00:18:43,721
(sighs)

297
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,895
- With a gentle bit of
  drizzle throughout the day.

298
00:18:50,897 --> 00:18:52,396
Now as we move onwards,

299
00:18:52,398 --> 00:18:54,765
we'll see that rain drift away

300
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:58,402
and it'll get warmer,
        generally dryer.

301
00:18:58,404 --> 00:18:59,904
It's about making sure (mumbles)

302
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:03,141
with high temperatures
    around 10 to 11 degrees.

303
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:03,908
Moved away

304
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:06,310
and become generally drier

305
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,548
with temperatures
       around 10 degrees.

306
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:15,887
Tomorrow is a widening
     band of cloud and rain

307
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,522
pushing slowly southwards

308
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:20,258
and then throughout the day,

309
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,626
it'll be gentle and wetter.

310
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:27,832
(sighs)

311
00:19:33,606 --> 00:19:36,340
(tense music)

312
00:19:39,445 --> 00:19:41,979
(phone buzzing)

313
00:19:50,456 --> 00:19:53,457
(speaking in foreign language)

314
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:54,759
- Yeah I'm just at home,

315
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:56,327
just not doing anything,

316
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,862
just watching TV.

317
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:03,267
Yeah I know, you didn't
     ask about the wedding.

318
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,587
Yeah, uh huh.

319
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:08,638
- Now not much is known about
 this Bradford woman Alice Moon

320
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:10,474
other than we have
      a promotional flyer

321
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,976
with a picture of her.

322
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:13,578
- Can I ring you back?

323
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,645
I'm just a bit busy.

324
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:16,814
Yeah, yeah, (mumbles)

325
00:20:16,816 --> 00:20:19,617
I got to go,

326
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,419
I'll ring you back
 later, yeah, okay? Alright, I
love you, okay, I love you, bye
              bye.

327
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:24,655
- What you can see behind
     me here on Baildonmoor

328
00:20:24,657 --> 00:20:26,958
is that a major
      police investigation

329
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,794
is taking place as two
    bodies have been found,

330
00:20:29,796 --> 00:20:33,497
both believed to be those of
  Kevin Smart and Donna Brown,

331
00:20:33,499 --> 00:20:37,235
victim's of notorious child
     killer Charles Sunday.

332
00:20:37,237 --> 00:20:40,838
Now in a bizarre twist
    to this horrific crime,

333
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,640
a lady named Alice Moon,

334
00:20:42,642 --> 00:20:44,508
who's a psychic medium

335
00:20:44,510 --> 00:20:47,311
and professes to be able
      to speak to the dead

336
00:20:47,313 --> 00:20:49,013
has led police to
        this very spot.

337
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,885
- Dawn, have you seen
      my Night Rider DVDs?

338
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,656
(phone blaring)

339
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,527
- Yeah?

340
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:04,695
- Right, I've got an idea.

341
00:21:04,697 --> 00:21:05,763
Where's Lucy?

342
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,966
- I put her in the shed.

343
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,601
- What the fuck's she
       doing in the shed?

344
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:13,337
- I can't tell Dawn
        why she's here.

345
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:16,374
- Well listen, just go get
   a photo of her right now.

346
00:21:16,376 --> 00:21:17,074
- A photo?

347
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:18,542
- Just get it fucking done,

348
00:21:18,544 --> 00:21:19,310
I'll ring you back.

349
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:23,381
(tense music)

350
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,693
(alarm blaring)

351
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:39,123
- Of course, uncle.

352
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:47,665
Fuck, fuck you all, man!

353
00:22:47,667 --> 00:22:49,166
And fuck Dusseldorf.

354
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,941
You, come lick my dick.

355
00:23:01,681 --> 00:23:04,515
(upbeat music)

356
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,791
(laughing)

357
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,633
- Don't fuck with the Asians.

358
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:05,302
- So don't fuck with the Asians.

359
00:25:05,304 --> 00:25:07,938
(upbeat music)

360
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,846
- [Boxy] This is
       never gonna work.

361
00:25:48,848 --> 00:25:50,281
- [Tariq] Shut the fuck up.

362
00:25:50,283 --> 00:25:53,250
(tires screeching)

363
00:25:55,121 --> 00:25:57,087
Looks like they've arrived.

364
00:25:57,089 --> 00:25:58,255
- [Boxy] Fireworks in the sky

365
00:25:58,257 --> 00:26:00,057
- [Both] Everyone's
         getting high.

366
00:26:03,696 --> 00:26:05,362
- [Tariq] Police business.

367
00:26:05,364 --> 00:26:06,997
- It's those trendy
       southern bastards

368
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,366
from the end of the
       street, isn't it?

369
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,901
I knew there were dodgy fuckers.

370
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,636
- [Tariq] Yes, it's them
   at the end of the street.

371
00:26:12,638 --> 00:26:14,338
- Make sure you taser the twats.

372
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,840
- [Tariq] Yes mam,
     just get back inside.

373
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,597
- [Alice] Hello?

374
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,099
- [Tariq] We've got
      a 10 AM appointment.

375
00:26:42,101 --> 00:26:43,334
- [Alice] You're a bit early,

376
00:26:43,336 --> 00:26:45,402
I'm still in my pyjamas.

377
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:48,038
- [Boxy] Bollocks, it is.

378
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,074
- [Alice] Ah, please!

379
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,721
- [Tariq] Go on then.

380
00:27:05,825 --> 00:27:07,625
Do whatever it is you do.

381
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:19,303
You told them cops
    where to find them kids.

382
00:27:20,239 --> 00:27:21,972
No one got paid or killed.

383
00:27:25,044 --> 00:27:27,044
You do all this mysterious
        shit, don't you?

384
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:31,015
- I don't use a Ouija board.

385
00:27:31,717 --> 00:27:33,951
- [Boxy] I told you this
      was a waste of time.

386
00:27:33,953 --> 00:27:35,019
- [Tariq] Shut up, man.

387
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,855
- [Boxy] So alright then,

388
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,123
what do we do?

389
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,026
- I need your help.

390
00:27:43,295 --> 00:27:46,063
I need something personal
       from your beloved.

391
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,266
- [Boxy] Hey, that's all?

392
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,302
- Yeah of course.

393
00:27:52,304 --> 00:27:56,273
Just I need something that
  belonged to the dead person

394
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:58,308
to make a connection.

395
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,410
- [Tariq] You got it.

396
00:28:09,221 --> 00:28:11,422
- [Boxy] This is mine.

397
00:28:11,424 --> 00:28:12,956
Don't take it.

398
00:28:16,028 --> 00:28:17,027
He gave it to me.

399
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:22,099
Well it might mysteriously
     end up in your pocket.

400
00:28:22,101 --> 00:28:23,300
- [Tariq] What?

401
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:25,069
- [Boxy] Well you're
     always taking my pens.

402
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,071
- [Tariq] Are you
        fucking serious?

403
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,238
- [Boxy] I lend you my pen

404
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,406
and you never gave me it back.

405
00:28:29,408 --> 00:28:31,275
You must have about
         50 of my pens.

406
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:33,177
- [Tariq] Shut the
       fuck up, sit down.

407
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:40,751
Go on then.

408
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,397
(tense music)

409
00:28:57,803 --> 00:29:00,337
- We all need to
      join hands, please.

410
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:02,406
- [Boxy] Whoa, whoa, whoa,
   I'm not holding his hand.

411
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:03,507
- There needs to be a circle.

412
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:05,476
- Take my hand and do the job.

413
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,819
- We wish to speak
      with the soul of...

414
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:19,857
- Yeah Frank, Frank Shaw.

415
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,162
- We wish to speak with the
   soul of Frank, Frank Shaw.

416
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,235
(dramatic music)

417
00:29:36,208 --> 00:29:37,841
Frank, is that you?

418
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,514
(dramatic music)

419
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:16,446
- [Trevor] Bastard.

420
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:18,515
- You Yorkshire bastard.

421
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:24,421
Tariq.

422
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:27,958
- Hey Trev, nice stereo,

423
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,959
did you nick it?

424
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:29,893
- Fucking hell, Boxy,

425
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,628
not all (mumbles) Nick stuff.

426
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:33,197
- You do.

427
00:30:33,199 --> 00:30:34,231
- Yeah.

428
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:37,201
(laughing)

429
00:30:37,203 --> 00:30:38,502
- Here Trevor, customers.

430
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,371
- How are you love?

431
00:30:42,474 --> 00:30:44,074
- [Trevor] I've just got 40.

432
00:30:46,445 --> 00:30:49,112
- Well that's okay.

433
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:50,981
Till tomorrow, okay?

434
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:07,264
- That's weak shit
        that is, Trevor.

435
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:08,966
- Thanks for the
        feedback, Tariq.

436
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,335
- Anyway--

437
00:31:11,337 --> 00:31:12,603
- Anyway, hand over the money,

438
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:14,004
we haven't got all day.

439
00:31:15,274 --> 00:31:16,573
- It's already done and left.

440
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:19,977
- Fuck are you on about?

441
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:22,312
- Frank collected a
      couple of hours ago.

442
00:31:22,314 --> 00:31:24,147
- What?

443
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,166
- It was a side job.

444
00:31:26,167 --> 00:31:28,184
Frank turned up and said he
   was collecting this week.

445
00:31:28,187 --> 00:31:29,553
Bit weak at all since
    the fireworks went off.

446
00:31:32,892 --> 00:31:34,391
Whoa boys, watch the wheels.

447
00:31:35,194 --> 00:31:37,294
- Where is the money?

448
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:38,428
- I swear,

449
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,230
(mumbles) to Frank.

450
00:31:40,232 --> 00:31:42,699
Frank's (mumbles).

451
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:46,270
- Actually fuck
       yeah, sorry yeah,

452
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:49,373
yeah you did say, he did
     say he was collecting.

453
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,676
- [Boxy] He didn't
        say that to me.

454
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,211
- Well he told me,
        I forgotten it.

455
00:32:00,686 --> 00:32:02,586
- See you later,
      you stuffed bastard.

456
00:32:06,191 --> 00:32:07,925
Yorkshire bastard.

457
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:14,097
- Bastard, fucking knew it.

458
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,367
He's making a play without us.

459
00:32:17,369 --> 00:32:19,036
- [Boxy] Playing what?

460
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:22,439
- [Tariq] That's 10, 15
 grand he's pocketed at least.

461
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:25,342
- Frank wouldn't do that.

462
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,611
- Frank's gonna do it and
     run of with the money.

463
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:29,546
- No way.

464
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:30,981
- Frank's gonna take that cash

465
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,549
and leave us to deal
      with my crazy uncle.

466
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,386
- Frank's like my dad

467
00:32:36,388 --> 00:32:39,089
and Tracey, they just wouldn't.

468
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:47,497
- It's our job to
      do the collections.

469
00:32:47,499 --> 00:32:49,132
You said so yourself.

470
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:53,003
So who's Uday gonna
        come looking for

471
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,438
once the cash goes missing, eh?

472
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:02,045
Look, all I'm saying is that

473
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:07,384
we find Frank, we ask him
 what the fuck he's playing at?

474
00:33:09,254 --> 00:33:10,587
Surely you can see that Boxy.

475
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,059
- I suppose so.

476
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:19,730
- Good.

477
00:33:21,667 --> 00:33:24,735
See, Frank's not the only
    one who's got your back.

478
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:29,306
And another thing,

479
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,508
I've never called
        you a mini knob.

480
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:37,280
I swear Boxy, the shit
      we've been through,

481
00:33:37,282 --> 00:33:39,383
we're practically brothers.

482
00:33:40,386 --> 00:33:42,419
- Brothers, you and me?

483
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,453
- Yeah because I'm the only
 one trying to save our skins,
           not Frank.

484
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,189
- Well if we're
     brothers and all that.

485
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:54,431
(dramatic music)

486
00:34:10,049 --> 00:34:12,282
(gasping)

487
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,488
- Take them ski masks off.

488
00:34:19,758 --> 00:34:22,359
No wait, I don't want
       to see your faces.

489
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:25,128
Get back in your
        box, mystic meg.

490
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:30,534
Well look who it is.

491
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,772
Mr. Shiny suit and mini knob.

492
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:37,808
- [Boxy] Sounds like Frank.

493
00:34:37,810 --> 00:34:39,209
- [Tariq] Frank?

494
00:34:39,211 --> 00:34:41,578
- Take 'em off or this
      conversation's over.

495
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:51,855
God, I'd almost forgotten
    how ugly you are, Boxy.

496
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,392
Me and Tracey used to say

497
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,893
your mother never
       gave birth to you,

498
00:34:56,895 --> 00:35:00,530
she shat you out like
    a slippery little turd.

499
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:01,531
- That is definitely Frank.

500
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,699
- Fuck you Boxy.

501
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,737
As if you haven't done enough?

502
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:11,408
You drowned me in
      that stinking canal.

503
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:13,210
He put a bullet in Tracey

504
00:35:13,212 --> 00:35:15,112
and then the pair of
    you dragged me back here

505
00:35:15,114 --> 00:35:16,546
like I'm your fucking puppet.

506
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:21,218
You couldn't even
     let me rest in peace.

507
00:35:22,488 --> 00:35:24,521
- Where's the money, Frank?

508
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:27,657
- Ah...

509
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:31,628
This was your plan,
         was it, Tariq?

510
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:34,731
(laughs)

511
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:38,301
I might've known
       it had been yours.

512
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:40,537
Well...

513
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:43,507
Well you're just an amateur

514
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:47,177
in a shiny suit.

515
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,148
- That's disrespectful
        that is, Frank.

516
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,682
- It is kind of shiny.

517
00:35:52,684 --> 00:35:53,750
- Fuck off.

518
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:55,652
The money, where is it?

519
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,190
- You haven't thought
    this through, have you?

520
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:01,825
How are you gonna
       make me tell you?

521
00:36:03,862 --> 00:36:05,228
Are you gonna shoot me?

522
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,831
'Cause here's the problem,

523
00:36:08,734 --> 00:36:10,901
I'm already dead.

524
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:30,420
- [Tariq] Not so
      fucking amateur now.

525
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:35,559
- I always knew you
     were a fucking snake.

526
00:36:35,561 --> 00:36:37,594
- Lucy's fine Frank, I promise.

527
00:36:37,596 --> 00:36:39,362
- You hurt one
       hair on her head--

528
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,365
- What, what are you gonna
    do, Frank, eh, haunt me?

529
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:43,667
- I love that bitch, Boxy.

530
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,569
- I know, I know you do, Frank.

531
00:36:45,571 --> 00:36:48,004
So please, just tell
     us where the money is.

532
00:36:57,482 --> 00:37:00,250
(upbeat music)

533
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:28,278
Hey Frank, what's
      it like having tits?

534
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,546
- You should know, Boxy,

535
00:37:29,548 --> 00:37:31,414
you've got a cracking
      pair there yourself.

536
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:32,649
- Can I touch 'em?

537
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:33,617
- Fuck off.

538
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,752
(laughs)

539
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,730
- You should've told
    us where the money was.

540
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,365
- Yeah I was gonna.

541
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50,600
But you drowned me
    before I had the chance

542
00:37:50,602 --> 00:37:53,937
you big dumb fucking ape.

543
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,505
- Yeah he's right you know.

544
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:56,690
- What do you mean?

545
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,874
- Oh fuck off Boxy!
       - It's your life.

546
00:37:57,876 --> 00:37:59,309
- If it wasn't for you,

547
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,743
we wouldn't be in this
  fucking shit now, would we?

548
00:38:00,746 --> 00:38:01,878
- Oh, it's my fault, is it?

549
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,346
(crosstalk)

550
00:38:03,348 --> 00:38:07,384
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't
    fuck yourselves over it!

551
00:38:07,386 --> 00:38:10,487
This being dead luck,
      it ain't too shabby.

552
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,723
I'll tell you what,

553
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:13,757
I get to go anywhere I want now.

554
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:15,558
You won't believe
     the things I've seen.

555
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,860
- Like what?

556
00:38:16,862 --> 00:38:18,995
- Like what really
      goes on in bedrooms.

557
00:38:21,333 --> 00:38:22,699
- Like you see everything?

558
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:24,000
- Yeah course I do.

559
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:29,506
- But you don't watch like
    homos doing it, do you?

560
00:38:29,508 --> 00:38:30,840
- Oh for fuck's sake, Boxy,

561
00:38:30,842 --> 00:38:33,443
are you still
      obsessed with cock?

562
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:35,378
Has he not tried it on
      with you yet, Tariq?

563
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,680
- Oh fuck off Frank.

564
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,381
- Take it, have you
      seen the size of it?

565
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:40,717
(laughing)

566
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:43,687
- As if.

567
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,693
(upbeat music)

568
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:14,684
- You wanted to know
      where the money is.

569
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,054
- You bought a travel agent?

570
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,456
- Stop messing Frank.

571
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:21,458
- I spent it on a cruise.

572
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,094
- You spent 15
       grand on a cruise?

573
00:39:24,096 --> 00:39:25,428
- You're lying.

574
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,731
- To be fair, it
    wasn't just any cruise.

575
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:28,765
- Well where you going?

576
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:29,999
- Where were we going?

577
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,837
- [Alice] It was an
    around the world cruise.

578
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,539
- Cut the shit, Frank,
       where's the money?

579
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:41,111
- Do you remember Tracey,
    Tariq, my beloved wife?

580
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:45,815
Stage four lung cancer.

581
00:39:52,391 --> 00:39:53,923
- Why didn't you say?

582
00:39:55,193 --> 00:39:56,926
- I didn't want
       to worry you, Box.

583
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:03,533
She'd always wanted
       to go on a cruise,

584
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:06,736
the love boat, she called it.

585
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:10,073
I kept saying I'd take her

586
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:11,941
but I was always too busy

587
00:40:11,943 --> 00:40:13,676
hoping you'd get rich.

588
00:40:17,616 --> 00:40:19,149
- I'm sorry Frank.

589
00:40:19,151 --> 00:40:20,583
- Go get the money.

590
00:40:20,585 --> 00:40:22,051
- How am I supposed to do that?

591
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:25,188
Sorry boys,

592
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,923
the fact is we were
       flying out today.

593
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:31,127
- So it's gone?

594
00:40:31,129 --> 00:40:32,862
- Yeah.

595
00:40:32,864 --> 00:40:34,697
So you might as well let Lucy go

596
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:37,567
and I can let this silly
    cow have her body back.

597
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,444
- Tariq, what you doing?

598
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:49,846
- Don't do anything stupid.

599
00:40:51,149 --> 00:40:53,883
(tense music)

600
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,637
Come on then, Tariq,
        get on with it.

601
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:15,772
- What are you doing?

602
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:17,006
No Tariq, stop!

603
00:41:17,008 --> 00:41:19,909
Bloody cock, he'll
        find you again.

604
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,011
- Shoot me, Tariq, shoot me.

605
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:24,147
You don't have
       the balls, do you?

606
00:41:24,149 --> 00:41:26,850
(gun blasts)

607
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,521
(screams)

608
00:41:39,865 --> 00:41:42,999
This is what happens
    when you're left alone.

609
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:46,503
This is why you're
       fucking amateurs,

610
00:41:46,505 --> 00:41:49,572
getting your knickers in
    a twist about 15 grand.

611
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:52,075
You should be thinking

612
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53,910
about where the 100 grand is.

613
00:41:57,649 --> 00:41:59,616
- What are you on about?

614
00:41:59,618 --> 00:42:01,651
- You thought with
         me out the way

615
00:42:01,653 --> 00:42:04,287
you'd be stepping into my shoes.

616
00:42:06,157 --> 00:42:08,925
Uday's, never gonna
         give you that,

617
00:42:08,927 --> 00:42:09,893
we both know it.

618
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:12,929
You might be family

619
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:16,866
but he treats you like shit.

620
00:42:26,211 --> 00:42:28,011
- What's this underground then?

621
00:42:30,649 --> 00:42:31,881
- Let me tell you

622
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:35,251
how our friends

623
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:37,987
in the Polish immigrant
     community do business.

624
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:41,624
As you know they're
      our main competitors

625
00:42:41,626 --> 00:42:43,159
for the drug trade in Bradford

626
00:42:43,161 --> 00:42:45,261
and its surrounding districts.

627
00:42:45,263 --> 00:42:49,966
So how do they get their
 money back to the motherland?

628
00:42:57,742 --> 00:42:59,909
Each month, they collect cash

629
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:01,711
from their various distributors

630
00:43:07,118 --> 00:43:08,985
which is then counted,

631
00:43:08,987 --> 00:43:12,255
changed into large
      denomination notes.

632
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:15,091
(upbeat music)

633
00:43:28,273 --> 00:43:29,872
Taken to the airport

634
00:43:31,643 --> 00:43:36,245
and handed over to a sympathetic
     airline professional.

635
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,824
The cash is then flown to Krakow

636
00:43:47,826 --> 00:43:50,159
where it lives
       happily ever after

637
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:54,964
except for when you
      two get to it first.

638
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,002
- Robbing Jenak's
       mob'll be suicide.

639
00:43:59,004 --> 00:44:02,138
- Yeah, you're right
   Tariq but everybody knows

640
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:07,010
that Janek and Uday have a
 special business relationship.

641
00:44:08,413 --> 00:44:09,912
Janek would have to assume

642
00:44:09,914 --> 00:44:12,081
that it was a couple
     of adventurous junkies

643
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:13,082
on an outside job.

644
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:16,119
- I don't know, Frank.

645
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:17,220
It sounds risky.

646
00:44:18,356 --> 00:44:19,455
- [Tariq] When does it happen?

647
00:44:19,457 --> 00:44:20,857
- I'm not sure.

648
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:22,392
- Well what fucking
       good is that then?

649
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:24,794
- Alright, calm down Tariq.

650
00:44:25,730 --> 00:44:28,097
As I explained,

651
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,333
I'm the all seeing
        eye these days.

652
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,300
Just give me a few hours

653
00:44:31,302 --> 00:44:32,935
and I'll go and find out.

654
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,806
- Well hop off then.

655
00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:39,275
- I want a guarantee
      that Lucy gets a cut

656
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:40,910
so I know she's comfortable.

657
00:44:42,714 --> 00:44:43,446
- Deal.

658
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:46,983
- You swear it Boxy,
       I don't trust him.

659
00:44:46,985 --> 00:44:47,850
- I swear Frank,

660
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,353
Lucy'll get a cut.

661
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:51,254
- Good.

662
00:45:00,065 --> 00:45:02,131
Please don't harm me, please.

663
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:04,801
I swear I won't tell anyone.

664
00:45:04,803 --> 00:45:06,936
Please let me go, please.

665
00:45:33,164 --> 00:45:34,063
- Hold on.

666
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:45,308
It's Frank bloody Shaw.

667
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,346
This is gonna get messy.

668
00:45:50,348 --> 00:45:51,948
- This is all we need right now.

669
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:52,815
- Yeah.

670
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:55,151
A bloody gang war.

671
00:45:57,355 --> 00:45:58,254
Right.

672
00:46:03,161 --> 00:46:04,060
- Where you going?

673
00:46:04,062 --> 00:46:06,295
- Time to rattle a few cages.

674
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:07,196
Come on.

675
00:46:19,210 --> 00:46:20,143
- [Announcer] Thomas Smart,

676
00:46:20,145 --> 00:46:21,261
Thomas Smart and Donna Brown

677
00:46:21,262 --> 00:46:22,378
on their way to
     school in Birkenshire

678
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,780
are thought to be
       the first victims

679
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:26,182
of notorious serial
     killer Charles Sunday.

680
00:46:26,184 --> 00:46:27,950
- I hope that fucker
         burns in hell.

681
00:46:33,358 --> 00:46:34,257
Go on then.

682
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:37,426
Is there a hell?

683
00:46:41,833 --> 00:46:43,900
- It's not like in the bible.

684
00:46:43,902 --> 00:46:48,337
The spirits of the dead are
  all around us all the time.

685
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:53,509
- What, like now?

686
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,017
And it was these spirits

687
00:47:01,019 --> 00:47:02,885
that told you where
        these kids were?

688
00:47:06,357 --> 00:47:08,224
- Something like that.

689
00:47:08,226 --> 00:47:11,027
(dramatic music)

690
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:15,298
Tracey wants you to know
     it wasn't your fault.

691
00:47:17,435 --> 00:47:19,902
(vomiting)

692
00:47:25,977 --> 00:47:27,243
- For fuck's sake Boxy,

693
00:47:27,245 --> 00:47:29,912
you look like you've
   swallowed a bucket of cum.

694
00:47:29,914 --> 00:47:30,646
- Frank?

695
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:32,615
- Tariq.

696
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:34,584
- [Tariq] What?

697
00:47:34,586 --> 00:47:36,452
- The money's being
        moved tomorrow.

698
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:42,658
The one place we know he's
   got to go is the airport.

699
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:48,598
Our courier always parks
    here in this multistory.

700
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,600
- [Tariq] We'll take it
    in the airport car park.

701
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:52,335
- [Alice] The exchange always
    takes place after hours

702
00:47:52,337 --> 00:47:53,336
so it'll be quiet.

703
00:47:53,338 --> 00:47:55,171
- [Tariq] Yeah cameras?

704
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:56,539
- Just one on every level.

705
00:47:58,042 --> 00:48:00,309
- We'll park near the
   entrance of the car park,

706
00:48:00,311 --> 00:48:01,544
follow him inside

707
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,346
and take him when
      he gets out the car?

708
00:48:04,582 --> 00:48:05,548
- Right.

709
00:48:06,618 --> 00:48:08,017
If he's carrying money,

710
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:12,288
he's going to be
    carrying something else.

711
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,427
No, it's a gun.

712
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:19,262
It's the barrel.

713
00:48:19,264 --> 00:48:20,229
- He's at the airport.

714
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:21,464
If he's carrying anything,

715
00:48:21,466 --> 00:48:22,899
he'll have to leave
         it in the car.

716
00:48:22,901 --> 00:48:24,233
- Right.

717
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,402
Now Boxy, I need you
      to get some wheels,

718
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,970
something anonymous.

719
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,639
- Yeah, yeah as long
       as I can drive it.

720
00:48:29,641 --> 00:48:30,539
- What?

721
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:31,540
- You know the getaway car?

722
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:33,009
- You can drive the car.

723
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:33,943
Now,

724
00:48:34,178 --> 00:48:35,344
are we set?

725
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,316
- This better work Frank.

726
00:48:40,318 --> 00:48:42,385
- You do as I say and it will.

727
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:45,655
- Let's hope so,
        for Lucy's sake.

728
00:48:45,657 --> 00:48:48,491
- No, Frank, Frank,
         Frank, Frank.

729
00:48:49,727 --> 00:48:51,193
Lucy's fine.

730
00:48:51,195 --> 00:48:53,429
I took her some food
        on the way over.

731
00:48:53,431 --> 00:48:55,498
- You can't leave
       her in that shed.

732
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,266
Just give me five minutes
     with her Box, please.

733
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,235
- Not till the job's done.

734
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:01,437
- Box, she needs me, please.

735
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:06,642
- Look, let's just
     have a game of poker.

736
00:49:07,412 --> 00:49:08,511
Like old times.

737
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:13,082
- I'm going to bed.

738
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:15,017
You two can keep in here.

739
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:19,622
- Prick's probably
     forgotten how to play.

740
00:49:19,624 --> 00:49:21,991
He's missed that many
     card nights recently.

741
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,296
I'll give you a
     game, Box, your deal.

742
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:32,401
Aces on the flop, nice.

743
00:49:32,403 --> 00:49:34,170
- Fuck all, again.

744
00:49:34,172 --> 00:49:35,771
- Blaggy Box,

745
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:38,040
how many times have I told you,

746
00:49:38,042 --> 00:49:40,443
look like a winner and
      the losers'll fold.

747
00:49:42,046 --> 00:49:44,246
- I've never been a
     winner though, Frank.

748
00:49:44,248 --> 00:49:46,415
- Each hand is a lesson, lad.

749
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:48,651
In cards and in life.

750
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:50,419
- I never seem to learn though.

751
00:49:50,421 --> 00:49:51,988
- Well that's fucking true.

752
00:49:53,391 --> 00:49:55,358
- Few cards short of the deck.

753
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:58,461
- Split the pack and
    left half behind, mate.

754
00:49:58,463 --> 00:49:59,996
- Sod off.

755
00:49:59,998 --> 00:50:02,164
(laughs)

756
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:07,670
- You're alright, Boxy.

757
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:11,340
And that's coming from
     the man you murdered.

758
00:50:22,754 --> 00:50:24,587
- It was an accident.

759
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:26,822
- I know.

760
00:50:38,069 --> 00:50:39,535
- I want to fix it.

761
00:50:44,575 --> 00:50:46,409
- You can't.

762
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:48,144
- I'm such a fuck up.

763
00:50:50,815 --> 00:50:52,481
Closest thing I've
      ever had to father--

764
00:50:52,483 --> 00:50:55,384
- We all make
    mistakes, son, even me.

765
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,136
(snoring)

766
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:21,210
(dramatic music)

767
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:25,848
- Lucy!

768
00:51:27,251 --> 00:51:29,652
(tense music)

769
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:36,826
- Good morning, love.

770
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:39,295
How could you let that
     bastard do this to me?

771
00:51:40,731 --> 00:51:42,698
I loved you like a son.

772
00:51:45,436 --> 00:51:47,636
(screams)

773
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:53,442
- Fuck you doing?

774
00:51:54,579 --> 00:51:56,479
- Couldn't sleep.

775
00:51:56,481 --> 00:51:58,848
Boxy's having nightmares.

776
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:00,182
- Sleep in the bathroom.

777
00:52:03,254 --> 00:52:05,521
- You sleep alright, Tariq?

778
00:52:05,523 --> 00:52:07,490
- Yeah, like a baby.

779
00:52:23,207 --> 00:52:25,274
(sighs)

780
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:53,235
(knocking on door)

781
00:52:53,237 --> 00:52:53,936
- Come.

782
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:59,608
Inspector Wilkes,

783
00:53:01,379 --> 00:53:02,611
welcome to the circus.

784
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,848
To what do I owe this honour?

785
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:09,218
- Frank Shaw, we fished him
   out of the canal yesterday

786
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,654
and when we went to tell
   his poor wife the sad news

787
00:53:11,656 --> 00:53:13,622
we found a bullet in her head.

788
00:53:13,624 --> 00:53:16,825
But you wouldn't know anything
     about that, would you?

789
00:53:16,827 --> 00:53:20,329
- You're right, I know
    nothing about it at all,

790
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:21,463
very sad news.

791
00:53:22,633 --> 00:53:24,800
But I don't understand
     why you're telling me.

792
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:27,903
- We thought you
      might be interested

793
00:53:27,905 --> 00:53:30,339
given that he managed
      your drug operation

794
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:32,408
across every white
      estate in the city.

795
00:53:33,578 --> 00:53:35,811
- Okay please just hold
  that thought for one minute.

796
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:41,217
Oh fuck.

797
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:49,024
Okay good, get off.

798
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:58,367
So where were we?

799
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,937
Oh yes, you said
     something about drugs.

800
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:07,509
It's an awful thing,
      this drugs business.

801
00:54:08,613 --> 00:54:10,779
I see it on TV what
       it does to people,

802
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,581
families,

803
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:15,017
women selling themselves
    to pay for their habit,

804
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:19,555
little orphans running
     around stealing shit,

805
00:54:19,557 --> 00:54:21,557
babies addicted at birth

806
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,992
with their faces all fucked up.

807
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:25,828
It's awful, awful.

808
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:31,767
And I'm deeply offended

809
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,870
that you police always think

810
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,739
I have something to do with this

811
00:54:37,642 --> 00:54:41,877
disgusting scud on our society.

812
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:46,815
It's because I'm
        Asian, isn't it?

813
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:48,017
It's actually racist.

814
00:54:49,287 --> 00:54:50,719
I think that your informants

815
00:54:50,721 --> 00:54:55,791
need to start attending
     Ku Klux Klub meetings.

816
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:57,660
- Ku Klux Klan?

817
00:54:58,596 --> 00:54:59,662
- Ku Klux Klub.

818
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,698
- Ku Klux Klan.

819
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:06,101
- Ku Klux

820
00:55:09,006 --> 00:55:09,905
clit.

821
00:55:13,611 --> 00:55:15,644
- Ku Klux Klan.

822
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:16,779
- Ku Klux Klan.

823
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:22,618
- Okay.

824
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,419
Thanks for your time.

825
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:24,320
- Any time.

826
00:55:26,757 --> 00:55:27,923
- I'll see myself out.

827
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:37,800
(coughs)

828
00:55:47,712 --> 00:55:48,811
- All out!

829
00:55:50,715 --> 00:55:51,914
I want that shit of a nephew

830
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:54,583
and his fucking psychic
      back here in pieces.

831
00:55:58,689 --> 00:56:00,589
Fucking do something!

832
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:17,806
- I thought you told him

833
00:56:17,808 --> 00:56:19,475
to steal something anonymous.

834
00:56:39,563 --> 00:56:41,964
(tense music)

835
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:19,768
- These fucking tickets.

836
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:22,838
I hate these things.

837
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,443
Can't fucking reach it.

838
00:57:28,746 --> 00:57:29,778
- What's that?

839
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:30,612
- The ticket.

840
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,847
- And?

841
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:33,782
- I'm not paying for it.

842
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:35,484
You'll pay for it.

843
00:57:35,486 --> 00:57:37,553
- It's your fucking car.

844
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,845
- So what are we supposed
       to be waiting for?

845
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:06,648
- Like I said, he's driving
   a white Audi four by four.

846
00:58:07,918 --> 00:58:09,117
- Half the crims in Bradford

847
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,786
drive white Audi four by fours.

848
00:58:10,788 --> 00:58:13,755
- But not every crim's packing
    it in tonight, are they?

849
00:58:24,268 --> 00:58:25,834
- Time for a piss.

850
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:26,835
- Fuck's sake, Boxy.

851
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:27,870
- Hold it in, Boxy lad.

852
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:32,875
- Oh here we go.

853
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:43,952
- See, I told you.

854
00:58:43,954 --> 00:58:44,920
- Just follow him.

855
00:58:46,857 --> 00:58:49,224
(tense music)

856
00:59:16,987 --> 00:59:18,020
- What do we do?

857
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:19,254
- Stick it over
       there on the left.

858
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:22,157
Tariq, you take me
      in, I've got to see.

859
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:23,058
- Okay.

860
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:31,066
(tense music)

861
00:59:40,578 --> 00:59:41,310
Okay.

862
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:50,619
Oh these stink?

863
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:51,753
- [Taqir] Did you get new ones?

864
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,055
- [Boxy] I didn't have time.

865
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:56,024
- Shut the fuck up and
   remember quick and quiet.

866
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:57,960
- [Boxy] Quick and
    quiet, quick and quiet.

867
00:59:57,962 --> 00:59:59,227
Okay, here we go.

868
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:05,033
(tense music)

869
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:33,729
- Janek, it's me, it's Tariq.

870
01:00:35,899 --> 01:00:36,999
It's me, man.

871
01:00:49,246 --> 01:00:54,282
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
       (gunfire blasting)

872
01:00:56,453 --> 01:00:58,987
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

873
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,856
(gunfire blasting)

874
01:01:00,858 --> 01:01:02,190
Wait, wait, wait.

875
01:01:03,927 --> 01:01:05,994
Wait, it's me Tariq man.

876
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,065
(upbeat music)

877
01:01:10,067 --> 01:01:12,134
- [Boxy] The money's in the
   other car, the other car.

878
01:01:12,136 --> 01:01:13,935
- The case, get the case.

879
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:16,371
(upbeat music)

880
01:01:19,209 --> 01:01:20,142
- Hey.

881
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:23,478
(speaking in foreign language)

882
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,681
(phone ringing)

883
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:29,484
(speaking in foreign language)

884
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:45,867
(upbeat music)

885
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,282
- [Boxy] I forgot the ticket.

886
01:02:00,284 --> 01:02:02,050
- I swear, if we get
       out of this alive,

887
01:02:02,052 --> 01:02:05,153
I'm gonna fucking
        kill you, Boxy.

888
01:02:05,155 --> 01:02:07,522
(tense music)

889
01:02:16,533 --> 01:02:18,200
Robbing bastards.

890
01:02:24,174 --> 01:02:25,073
Fuck.

891
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,978
- [Alice] Come on, Tariq.

892
01:02:34,451 --> 01:02:35,450
- Ugh fuck!

893
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:38,019
- [Alice] Janek!

894
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:53,401
(gunfire blasts)

895
01:02:53,403 --> 01:02:55,237
- Now get in the fucking car.

896
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:58,273
(upbeat music)

897
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:01,910
- Come on, get in,
        fucking get in!

898
01:03:01,912 --> 01:03:04,379
(upbeat music)

899
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:13,188
Nice job boys, slick.

900
01:03:14,158 --> 01:03:19,227
- [Boxy] Fuck you, Frank.

901
01:03:29,373 --> 01:03:30,906
- [Alice] I think
    you'd better thank Boxy

902
01:03:30,908 --> 01:03:32,040
for saving your ass flaps.

903
01:03:33,277 --> 01:03:35,210
Now we need to lie low

904
01:03:35,212 --> 01:03:37,145
and I know just the place.

905
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:45,921
(tense music)

906
01:04:01,972 --> 01:04:04,139
- What's this, Frank?

907
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:05,941
- Looks like a pink unicorn.

908
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,147
It's not my fault
        you two fuck ups

909
01:04:12,149 --> 01:04:14,649
couldn't rob candy from a baby.

910
01:04:14,651 --> 01:04:17,152
(screams)

911
01:04:17,154 --> 01:04:18,887
- [Boxy] Fuck you,
        don't touch me!

912
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:21,156
- Who's side you on anyway?

913
01:04:21,158 --> 01:04:23,625
- What you doing Tariq?

914
01:04:23,627 --> 01:04:24,993
Hey that's my knife.

915
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:27,229
- What?

916
01:04:27,231 --> 01:04:28,330
- You can't help
       yourself can you?

917
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:29,898
I knew you were gonna keep it.

918
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,633
- We're a day away from
     ending up in the canal

919
01:04:31,635 --> 01:04:33,568
and all you can think
      about is this knife.

920
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:34,603
- It's my knife.

921
01:04:34,605 --> 01:04:36,338
- Actually it's my knife.

922
01:04:38,375 --> 01:04:39,307
Look Tariq,

923
01:04:41,278 --> 01:04:44,145
I've got an emergency stash.

924
01:04:44,147 --> 01:04:46,014
Let Boxy go

925
01:04:46,016 --> 01:04:47,349
and I'll take you to it.

926
01:04:49,653 --> 01:04:51,086
- Stop lying Frank.

927
01:04:52,356 --> 01:04:54,256
- Hey I'm old school.

928
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:57,392
We're always taught to keep
    your stash hidden away.

929
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:03,698
- How much?

930
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:05,634
- Maybe enough to
        stop Uncle Uday

931
01:05:05,636 --> 01:05:07,602
from chopping your
       fucking head off.

932
01:05:10,707 --> 01:05:12,707
- If you're lying Frank,

933
01:05:13,977 --> 01:05:15,577
I'm gonna gut Lucy
        in front of you.

934
01:05:19,483 --> 01:05:22,951
- Don't you ever put a
   knife to my throat again.

935
01:05:22,953 --> 01:05:24,219
Have you got me, Tariq?

936
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:27,188
- Alright Boxy, alright.

937
01:05:27,190 --> 01:05:28,290
- Right,

938
01:05:28,292 --> 01:05:30,225
we're gonna go with Frank,

939
01:05:30,227 --> 01:05:33,128
he's gonna tell us
       where the money is

940
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,329
and then we're sorted.

941
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,969
- You know I'd never
        hurt you, right?

942
01:05:40,971 --> 01:05:41,736
- And another thing

943
01:05:41,738 --> 01:05:43,405
give me my fucking knife.

944
01:05:53,617 --> 01:05:55,317
- I want their families dead.

945
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,420
I want their pets dead.

946
01:05:58,422 --> 01:06:00,121
I want the guy

947
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,556
who delivers their online
   supermarket shopping dead

948
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:04,993
and I want those diamonds
       back here tonight.

949
01:06:05,996 --> 01:06:07,228
Do you understand me?

950
01:06:07,230 --> 01:06:08,730
- [Men] Yes boss.

951
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,599
- Now I have it
       from a good source

952
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:16,404
that Janek and his people
  were all over that car park.

953
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:18,740
So we start with
     their car washes yeah?

954
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:20,241
- [Men] Yes boss.

955
01:06:20,243 --> 01:06:21,042
- Yeah?

956
01:06:21,044 --> 01:06:22,377
- [Men] Yes boss.

957
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:24,579
- Go.

958
01:06:25,782 --> 01:06:26,681
Go.

959
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:03,651
- I told you to go straight on.

960
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,420
Are you deaf as well as stupid?

961
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:06,354
- We're gonna go get Lucy.

962
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:07,522
She stays in the boot of the car

963
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:08,723
until we get the money

964
01:07:08,725 --> 01:07:10,225
and if you're lying
        Frank, I swear.

965
01:07:12,396 --> 01:07:14,596
(shivering)

966
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:21,503
(grunting)

967
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,788
- Janek, friend,

968
01:07:43,193 --> 01:07:46,528
I'm gonna ask you one more time

969
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,797
where are my fucking diamonds?

970
01:07:52,335 --> 01:07:54,436
(laughing)

971
01:08:04,748 --> 01:08:07,382
One more time, one more time,

972
01:08:07,384 --> 01:08:09,084
where are the diamonds?

973
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:10,518
One more time, tell me, tell me.

974
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,821
(laughing)

975
01:08:24,468 --> 01:08:26,668
(screaming)

976
01:08:40,717 --> 01:08:41,616
Woo!

977
01:08:45,655 --> 01:08:48,389
(tense music)

978
01:10:21,785 --> 01:10:23,618
- Where the fuck is it?

979
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:25,920
Why don't you just
        put it (mumbles)

980
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,488
like every fucker else?

981
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:28,356
- Here.

982
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:30,258
- Here?

983
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:32,760
- Under there.

984
01:10:35,298 --> 01:10:36,798
- You got a shovel?

985
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,765
- It's in the car.

986
01:10:39,302 --> 01:10:42,470
- Well then Tariq, off you trot.

987
01:10:52,449 --> 01:10:54,816
(tense music)

988
01:11:12,068 --> 01:11:13,534
Do you remember Tyrone?

989
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,554
- Who?

990
01:11:16,555 --> 01:11:18,405
- Kid with long hair,
       speech impediment.

991
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:21,476
- Yeah Tyrone, that's
        right, condoms.

992
01:11:23,413 --> 01:11:25,446
- Do you know that he loaded
    a condom full of smack?

993
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,615
- Yeah, went through
    customs and it exploded.

994
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:29,083
- They're still
    cleaning shit off walls

995
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:30,785
in Manchester Airport.

996
01:11:30,787 --> 01:11:34,055
- Hey, Falcon said his eyes
 nearly bulged out of his head,

997
01:11:34,057 --> 01:11:34,889
how 'bout that?

998
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:35,823
(laughs)

999
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:36,624
- Shouldn't laugh really.

1000
01:11:36,626 --> 01:11:37,992
- Oh, and did you see

1001
01:11:37,994 --> 01:11:40,395
that Chinese girl
       from Birkenshire.

1002
01:11:40,397 --> 01:11:41,629
What did you used to call her?

1003
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:42,530
- Loco Ono.

1004
01:11:43,667 --> 01:11:44,732
A fucking character.

1005
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:45,767
- Right bastard.

1006
01:11:57,881 --> 01:11:59,847
- Fuck are you looking at?

1007
01:12:09,626 --> 01:12:12,360
(tense music)

1008
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,670
- Hey guess who
      I've seen shagging?

1009
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:23,771
- Oh who?

1010
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:24,806
- Wills and Kate.

1011
01:12:24,808 --> 01:12:25,973
- Oh you ain't?

1012
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:28,409
- Uday and that
     weather girl up Tariq.

1013
01:12:28,411 --> 01:12:30,611
- I knew it, I told him that.

1014
01:12:30,613 --> 01:12:31,479
- Yeah Tariq

1015
01:12:33,616 --> 01:12:34,782
and your Dawn.

1016
01:12:42,559 --> 01:12:43,925
They're at it all
       the fucking time,

1017
01:12:43,927 --> 01:12:45,493
they're like rabbits.

1018
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:48,496
- No way.

1019
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:52,066
- Just think for once
       in your life Boxy,

1020
01:12:52,068 --> 01:12:54,535
why hasn't he been
        coming to poker?

1021
01:12:54,537 --> 01:12:55,870
He never used to miss a game.

1022
01:12:56,706 --> 01:12:57,972
- He said he got business.

1023
01:12:57,974 --> 01:12:59,807
- Yeah, yeah he
       has got business,

1024
01:12:59,809 --> 01:13:01,776
shagging your Dawn.

1025
01:13:02,812 --> 01:13:05,113
- No, I don't
      believe you, Frank.

1026
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:06,948
Look, Frank, just stop, right,

1027
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:08,649
it's not honest, this.

1028
01:13:08,651 --> 01:13:12,120
- Dawn didn't seem that keen
 to go away with you, did she?

1029
01:13:14,758 --> 01:13:16,023
- No I don't believe you.

1030
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,559
- Well let's find out.

1031
01:13:18,561 --> 01:13:19,894
Why don't you ask him?

1032
01:13:21,765 --> 01:13:22,864
- Ask him what?

1033
01:13:23,700 --> 01:13:24,499
- It don't matter,

1034
01:13:24,501 --> 01:13:25,166
just leave it, alright?

1035
01:13:25,168 --> 01:13:26,100
- What's he been saying?

1036
01:13:26,102 --> 01:13:28,102
- Do you want this money or not?

1037
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:28,936
- Give me the shovel.

1038
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:29,837
- Fucking dig.

1039
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:34,742
(tense music)

1040
01:13:53,830 --> 01:13:55,062
- Mind what you're doing man?

1041
01:13:55,064 --> 01:13:57,632
I'm standing here, you dick.

1042
01:14:01,871 --> 01:14:03,688
You fucking dickhead,

1043
01:14:03,689 --> 01:14:05,506
you just threw it
      at my fucking suit.

1044
01:14:05,508 --> 01:14:07,041
Fucking pay for it, man.

1045
01:14:08,878 --> 01:14:09,844
- Whoa!

1046
01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:11,446
- Are you fucking my Dawn?

1047
01:14:11,448 --> 01:14:12,713
- What's he been saying?

1048
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:13,748
That's bullshit, man.

1049
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:15,616
- Are you shagging Dawn?

1050
01:14:15,618 --> 01:14:17,251
- That's bollocks, man,
     it's the last bullet.

1051
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:18,519
- [Boxy] He sees things.

1052
01:14:18,521 --> 01:14:19,821
He's seen you both doing it.

1053
01:14:19,823 --> 01:14:21,622
- I've not slept with
     your girlfriend, man,

1054
01:14:21,624 --> 01:14:22,924
what are you on about?

1055
01:14:22,926 --> 01:14:24,859
- I'm gonna shoot you
      in the fucking face.

1056
01:14:24,861 --> 01:14:26,227
- Wait Boxy, wait,

1057
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:28,863
what would prove it man?

1058
01:14:28,865 --> 01:14:30,965
- Oh yeah, that's right Boxy,

1059
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:33,901
you two, you're
      practically brothers

1060
01:14:33,903 --> 01:14:37,138
except when he's got a
     knife to your throat.

1061
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:39,907
Oh, and when Dawn's with him,

1062
01:14:39,909 --> 01:14:41,909
she takes it up the ass.

1063
01:14:43,813 --> 01:14:46,280
- This is all your
         fucking fault.

1064
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:48,015
Fucking stupid dick!

1065
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:51,752
(grunting)

1066
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,763
Fuck.

1067
01:15:02,765 --> 01:15:05,166
(screaming)

1068
01:15:09,706 --> 01:15:10,872
Please don't do
      this, Frank, please.

1069
01:15:10,874 --> 01:15:11,839
- You killed me.

1070
01:15:11,841 --> 01:15:14,108
You murdered my wife

1071
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,010
and you kidnapped my Lucy.

1072
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:21,916
Imagine Tariq, if you will,
    how I might be feeling?

1073
01:15:22,685 --> 01:15:23,684
- Forget the money, Frank.

1074
01:15:23,686 --> 01:15:24,952
- This was never
        about the money.

1075
01:15:24,954 --> 01:15:29,090
- Sorry please, I'm
      begging you, please.

1076
01:15:29,092 --> 01:15:30,258
It wasn't me.

1077
01:15:31,794 --> 01:15:33,194
Boxy killed you,

1078
01:15:34,063 --> 01:15:36,664
he killed Tracey, not me.

1079
01:15:36,666 --> 01:15:37,732
- Oh really?

1080
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:40,034
In that case...

1081
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:45,006
(sobbing)

1082
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:49,043
(gunshots firing)

1083
01:15:52,882 --> 01:15:54,649
God that feels good.

1084
01:16:03,927 --> 01:16:05,192
I'm sorry Boxy lad.

1085
01:16:06,896 --> 01:16:08,663
This was never part of the plan.

1086
01:16:11,167 --> 01:16:14,936
I'll look out for you
       on the other side.

1087
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:43,864
There's just one
        more thing Alice

1088
01:16:43,866 --> 01:16:45,266
before you send me back,

1089
01:16:46,369 --> 01:16:50,771
please promise I'll make
      it worth your while.

1090
01:17:28,044 --> 01:17:33,114
Lucy, come here,
      come on, good girl.

1091
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:40,054
Oh yes, you're daddy's
    Mr. Special little girl.

1092
01:17:40,757 --> 01:17:42,857
Who's this?

1093
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,425
Have they been
       looking after you?

1094
01:17:46,195 --> 01:17:49,163
Daddy's gonna have to
   give you to somebody else

1095
01:17:50,767 --> 01:17:53,801
to look after, yeah.

1096
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:57,638
Alice, you've got to promise me.

1097
01:17:57,639 --> 01:17:59,439
You've got to swear that
    you'll take care of her.

1098
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:01,275
Swear it.

1099
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:03,678
Course Frank.

1100
01:18:05,682 --> 01:18:07,782
Lucy will have a
     loving home for life.

1101
01:18:09,218 --> 01:18:12,453
Now, it's time for you to go.

1102
01:18:15,291 --> 01:18:17,425
Just give me five more minutes.

1103
01:18:19,262 --> 01:18:20,161
Please.

1104
01:18:24,300 --> 01:18:25,700
Goodbye Frank.

1105
01:18:40,850 --> 01:18:43,184
(whimpering)

1106
01:18:55,131 --> 01:18:57,832
(phone ringing)

1107
01:19:03,172 --> 01:19:05,506
- Inspector Wilkes, are the
   streets of Bradford safe?

1108
01:19:05,508 --> 01:19:07,541
- There is no official
    statement being released

1109
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:09,076
at this time.
 - Are the streets of Bradford

1110
01:19:09,078 --> 01:19:09,877
safe?

1111
01:19:09,879 --> 01:19:10,778
- We need to know,

1112
01:19:10,780 --> 01:19:12,146

1114

Excuse me, please, excuse me.

1115
01:19:16,886 --> 01:19:18,219
Out of the way, thank you.

1116

1120
01:19:26,129 --> 01:19:27,161
- [Sophie] Seriously (mumbles)

1121
01:19:27,162 --> 01:19:28,194
about whether West
      Yorkshire's streets

1122
01:19:28,197 --> 01:19:29,530
are safe or not from gun crime.

1123
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:31,031
We'll let you know.

1124
01:19:31,033 --> 01:19:32,233
Back to the studio.

1125
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:35,569
(sirens blaring)

1126
01:19:35,571 --> 01:19:38,305
(ominous music)

1127
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:00,995
- Tomorrow, it'll
      start brightening up

1128
01:20:00,997 --> 01:20:04,465
and we'll have (mumbles)

1129
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:07,434
and tomorrow will
      be cooler and drier

1130
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:09,503
for Friday and Saturday.

1131
01:20:10,439 --> 01:20:12,273
- [Reporter] Thanks Joe

1132
01:20:12,275 --> 01:20:14,408
and now back to our
    main story this evening,

1133
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:15,810
a violent gang war

1134
01:20:15,812 --> 01:20:18,078
has broken out on the
      streets of Bradford.

1135
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:19,413
Two men have been
        shot and killed

1136
01:20:19,415 --> 01:20:22,016
at a shoot out in a
      multistory car park

1137
01:20:22,018 --> 01:20:23,350
and two further bodies
      have been discovered

1138
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:25,186
in a local cemetery.

1139
01:20:25,188 --> 01:20:27,121
All the shootings are
   thought to be gang related

1140
01:20:27,123 --> 01:20:29,356
and part of a deadly
      struggle for control

1141
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:32,092
of the illegal drug
    trade in West Yorkshire.

1142
01:20:32,094 --> 01:20:34,195
With police resources
  stretched to breaking points

1143
01:20:34,197 --> 01:20:36,130
and a rising tide of gun crime,

1144
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:40,034
we've been asking are the
   streets of Bradford safe?

1145
01:20:40,036 --> 01:20:42,102
It's a question our
     reporter Sophie Walker

1146
01:20:42,104 --> 01:20:44,905
tried to put to the officer
 in charge of the investigation

1147
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,273
earlier today.

1148
01:20:46,275 --> 01:20:48,008
- No official statement is
    to be made at this time.

1149
01:20:48,010 --> 01:20:50,311
- We need to know are West
   Yorkshire's streets safe?

1150
01:20:50,313 --> 01:20:53,247
We need to know.
   - No comment, no comment.

1151
01:20:53,249 --> 01:20:54,248
- Whether they're safe or not.

1152
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:55,866
Will you please?

1153
01:20:55,867 --> 01:20:57,483
As you can see there
     is no official comment

1154
01:20:57,486 --> 01:20:58,652
from West Yorkshire police

1155
01:20:58,654 --> 01:21:00,221
but as soon as we know something

1156
01:21:00,223 --> 01:21:01,355
about whether West
      Yorkshire's streets

1157
01:21:01,357 --> 01:21:03,123
are safe or not from gun crime,

1158
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,158
we'll let you know.

1159
01:21:04,160 --> 01:21:05,593
Back to the studio.

1160
01:21:34,190 --> 01:21:35,055
- Help me.

1161
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,625
Are you gonna help me Alice?

1162
01:21:37,627 --> 01:21:39,526
Help me get the
     bastard who did this.

1163
01:21:39,528 --> 01:21:41,095
- Sorry love.

1164
01:21:46,102 --> 01:21:48,102
You can't afford me.

1165
01:21:48,104 --> 01:21:50,638
(upbeat music)
