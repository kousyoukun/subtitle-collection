319
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,861
and I wanna tap that without you there.
You got it?

320
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,274
You know, first of all,
Steven, it's my house.

321
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,067
You're lucky I'm
letting you stay here.

322
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,361
Look, you wanted me to
get a job, so I got one.

323
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:10,201
At least let me have the
house for the weekend.

324
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,616
My house, my rules.

325
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:15,080
<i>And as for tonight, if you
don't wanna risk coming home</i>

326
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,870
<i>and seeing more of your
mother than you'd like,</i>

327
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,710
I suggest you stay out late.

328
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,000
Gross.

329
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,294
(ALL LAUGHING)

330
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,306
That was really...

331
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,682
Hey, bar wench,
can I get a Budweiser?

332
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,471
Beer down.

333
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:40,359
What the fuck are you
fuckers doing here?

334
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,031
You made it! Made what?

335
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,157
What are you talking about?

336
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,243
What do you mean?
We sent you an e-mail

337
00:17:53,406 --> 00:17:56,125
about getting together a couple
of days before the reunion.

338
00:17:56,284 --> 00:18:00,209
You know what? I must have put
two F's in "Stifmeister."

339
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,793
JIM: What? KEVIN: I'm sorry.

340
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:05,627
(LAUGHS)

341
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,008
Two F's? You dumbass!

342
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,384
Kev!

343
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,340
Hey, Kevin, is that
a pussy on your face?

344
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:12,801
(TRILLING LIPS) Oh, come on!

345
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,685
Yeah, yeah, yeah! (SNIFFING)

346
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,886
Nice.

347
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,643
So, Stifler,
you're looking sharp.

348
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:19,144
What are you up to these days?

349
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,601
I work at JBH Global.

350
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:23,686
Wow! That's a big-time firm.

351
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,937
What do you do over there?

352
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,189
Oh, you know,

353
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,366
investment stuff.

354
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:32,203
People wonder why our financial
system's falling apart.

355
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,327
Nice scarf. I see you finally
came out of the closet.

356
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,036
How is your mother, Stifler?

357
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:38,917
You stay away from
my mom, shitbreak.

358
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,579
Okay, boys,
the past is the past.

359
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,289
We can bury
the hatchet here, huh?

360
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,045
Yeah, fuck it.

361
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,960
Hey, short-shorts!
A round of Jägerbombs for me and my boys!

362
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,470
Go fuck yourself, Stifler.

363
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,011
How the hell does
she know my name?

364
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,055
STIFLER: (CACKLING) Lard Arms?

365
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,306
JIM: Jesus, Stifler.

366
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,354
Talk about an ugly duckling
turning into a swan, right?

367
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,350
Let me see that.

368
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:08,774
Oh! Fingered her,
hairy nips, huge boobs.

369
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:11,443
Oh. (MOANS)

370
00:19:12,026 --> 00:19:13,619
There she is!

371
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,738
<i>The créme de my cock.</i>

372
00:19:16,447 --> 00:19:17,573
Blowjob Lipstein.

373
00:19:17,782 --> 00:19:21,082
Her given name
was Loni, Stifler.

374
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,962
She used to call me Big Stiffy.

375
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:27,963
She was the mouth
that got away.

376
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,172
Last call!

377
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:32,464
Already? Wait here, guys.

378
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:35,933
Oh! Man, the Senior Wish List.

379
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,060
Wish List?
I don't remember that.

380
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,854
Oh, yeah, man.
It's that cheesy page in the yearbook

381
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,058
where we all had to write
wishes about our future.

382
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,019
What, did you write something cheesy?
Let's see.

383
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:50,941
"Chris Ostreicher.
Hopes to coach his son's lacrosse team."

384
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,242
Oh! Isn't that the
sweetest thing?

385
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,534
Well,

386
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,742
I guess I thought
I'd have a family by now.

387
00:19:57,822 --> 00:19:59,119
All right, you wanna hear
what you wrote, Finch?

388
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,290
FINCH: I do.

389
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:04,249
"Paul Finch hopes to
find le grand amour."

390
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,539
Yes, true love.

391
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:11,256
Alas, I have yet to find what you
would call a real relationship.

392
00:20:11,419 --> 00:20:14,047
Right, because banging
Stifler's mom didn't count.

393
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,262
OZ: All right, let's see
what you got, Kev.

394
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:20,850
"Kevin Myers. Hopes to
still be living it up"

395
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:24,106
"with the amazing
Vicky Lathum."

396
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:25,562
Oh, man! Vicky! What?

397
00:20:25,725 --> 00:20:28,023
I am sure your wife would
be very happy to read that.

398
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,938
What? I was dating
Vicky at the time.

399
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,447
Let me see what I put.

400
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,902
"Jim Levenstein"

401
00:20:41,991 --> 00:20:45,086
"hopes to have the
sex life of Ricky Martin."

402
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,917
So, I'm assuming you didn't
know he was gay back then.

403
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,672
Jim, it's a good thing
you found a woman

404
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:54,595
with the sex drive
of a dozen groupies. Hmm?

405
00:20:55,004 --> 00:20:57,006
I mean, you're probably having
more sex than any of us.

406
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,350
Probably, you know.

407
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,513
Hope you guys are thirsty.
Stifler Claus is here.

408
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,273
Whoa! Stifler, that's a little
too much, don't you think?

409
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:08,526
Dude, find your balls
and return them to your sack.

410
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:10,690
I say we keep this party going.

411
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,693
I say we make this
weekend our bitch.

412
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,325
We could party together, do all the
same shit that we used to do together.

413
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:17,827
It'll be just like old times.

414
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:20,659
Hell yes! That's why I'm here.

415
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,324
<i>No Bachelorette,
no Real Housewives.</i>

416
00:21:23,491 --> 00:21:27,041
Thing is, you only get one
chance at your 13th reunion.

417
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,583
I was kind of hoping to spend
a little time with the wife.

418
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,709
Fuck! Dude!

419
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:36,171
James? What? Come on!

420
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,014
I mean, I'm in. Of course I'm in.
Come on, what?

421
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,174
Yeah! Yeah.

422
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:43,932
Then, gentlemen, I hope you're
all wearing protection,

423
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,142
because this weekend,
we're gonna fuck shit up!

424
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:47,978
JIM: Cheers!
OZ: Yeah! All right!

425
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,024
(DOORBELL RINGING)

426
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,442
(GROANS SOFTLY)

427
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,626
What the fuck?

428
00:22:12,206 --> 00:22:14,174
Holy shit.

429
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:17,920
(BOTH GIGGLING)

430
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,676
Hey!

431
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,261
Hi.

432
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,683
What happened?

433
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:28,435
(STUTTERING)
I don't really remember.

434
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:32,522
I blame you. How much did you
let him drink last night?

435
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:35,404
SELENA: Honestly,
not that much.

436
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:38,783
Well, we gotta clean this up
before we go to the lake.

437
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:42,036
What? The lake?

438
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,285
Yeah, the lake, dude.
It was your idea.

439
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,000
We discussed
all this last night.

440
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,377
Oh, the lake!
Yes, of course, the...

441
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,755
Hey, Jim, can you hand me
those paper towels, please?

442
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:58,469
Oh, those paper towels?
The paper ones.

443
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,553
Uh...

444
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,390
The paper towels, Jim.

445
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:05,471
Jim! Yeah...

446
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,019
The paper towels!

447
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,270
(GASPS)

448
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,478
I'm really sorry.

449
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:20,525
Jim, you do realize that
the lid is see-through, right?

450
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,158
Oh, wow.

451
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,579
Good eye.

452
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:33,166
That's the father of my child.

453
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,168
(WHOOPING)

454
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,144
Oh, come on!

455
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,722
Hey, watch it! Okay, jeez.

456
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:55,439
Am I wrong, or was this place a lot
more fun when we were younger?

457
00:23:55,601 --> 00:23:58,775
No, no. I think it's the same.
We're just old now.

458
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,154
But were we just as obnoxious
as these kids back in the day?

459
00:24:03,317 --> 00:24:04,489
No.

460
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,329
Us, our generation,
we were more mature.

461
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,161
Hey, guys, check it out.

462
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:11,659
Vagina shark!

(SCREAMING)

464
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:16,584
He touched my snatch!

465
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:18,833
I take that back.

466
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,260
FINCH: Oh, my God.

467
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,183
Fellas, do you gotta stare?

468
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,346
Yeah. Yeah.

469
00:24:32,513 --> 00:24:34,106
Yes, we do need to stare.

470
00:24:35,349 --> 00:24:39,149
(SCOFFS) Could Jim
be any more obvious?

471
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,735
Oh, give him a break.

472
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:45,492
I mean, it's not every day you get to see
a model walking around off the page.

473
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,990
There hasn't been
a whole lot of sexy time

474
00:24:50,072 --> 00:24:52,120
in the Levenstein
household lately.

475
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:53,200
Why not?

476
00:24:54,118 --> 00:24:56,997

638
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,244
It looks like
a high school party.

639
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:29,532
With high school chicks.

640
00:32:31,533 --> 00:32:32,830
It's on.

641
00:32:32,993 --> 00:32:35,542
Watch it, Stifler. You know these
girls are, like, half your age.

642
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,796
I know.

Okay, is it just me, or do girls
today seem a bit sluttier?

646
00:32:46,715 --> 00:32:47,762
Definitely.

647
00:32:47,841 --> 00:32:50,890
Teen sex, rainbow parties,
sexting nude photos...

648

I saw it all on

Kara. You came!

652
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:07,361
Hey!

653
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:09,492
Sorry.

Oh, my God,
is this the babysitter?

657
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,502
Mmm-hmm.

658
00:33:16,578 --> 00:33:19,081
You make it sound like I'm a superhero.

Hey, Jim. Do you wanna
introduce me to your friends?

665
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:31,259
No.

666
00:33:33,595 --> 00:33:35,017
Girls, this is Stifler.

667
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:37,940
So, how do you know
my best friend Jim?

668
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:39,817
Jim used to be my babysitter.

669
00:33:41,645 --> 00:33:43,693
Hey, I was just
gonna do a birthday shot.

670
00:33:43,772 --> 00:33:45,115
Do you guys
wanna do one with me?

671
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,316
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

672
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,400
Yeah. Oh, ye& yes, yes.

673
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:49,369
I shouldn't.
Yes, we should, yes, we should.

674
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:53,824
Never have I ever
had sex in public.

675
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,998
Really? None of you?

676
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,792
Oh, come on, Heather.
You haven't drank once.

677
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,506
You are such a prude!

678
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:09,424
Or maybe I've just
never had sex in public.

679
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:15,764
Okay, never have I
ever been in an orgy.

680
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:23,274
They were really nice guys.

681
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,153
Believe it or not, this is
my first high school party.

682
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,783
You didn't miss much.

683
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:33,493
I always preferred staying at
home, throwing on a little NPR.

684
00:34:33,655 --> 00:34:35,498
You were so much
cooler than me.

685
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:39,579
I sat around writing
<i>X-Files</i> fan fiction.

686
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:47,344
I translated The Brothers
Karamazov into Latin for fun.

687
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,173
That is so sexy.

688
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,679
You know it is.

689
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:55,518
I've only been
working as an architect

690
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:58,017
for the last few years,
and from home.

691
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,056
You've been with the same
company for over ten years.

692
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,476
That's awesome, it sounds like
everything is working out for you.

693
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,941
Yeah. I mean, everything's
good, especially work-wise.

694
00:35:06,021 --> 00:35:07,523
But now that we're
back here in the town,

695
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,149
and we see, like,
all of our old friends,

696
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:11,865
and everyone's married
and having kids,

697
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:14,951
it just makes me,
you know, think.

698
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,286
(COUGHS)

699
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,537
You okay there, Kev?

700
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:22,208
Yeah, I just don't
normally drink like this.

701
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,418
You're telling me you haven't
gotten a little bit tipsy

702
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,919
on Myers Family Wine Night?

703
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:29,131
I see somebody's been
stalking my Facebook page.

704
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:31,672
At least I don't take
pictures of my meals.

705
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,306
Who's stalking who now?

706
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,810
Okay, so I've been by your
page maybe once or twice.

707
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,222
You were dating someone
named Alessandro?

708
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:44,059
You know, he does know that he can take
a picture with his shirt on, right?

709
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:47,320
Alessandro is long gone.

710
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,990
It's over, huh?

711
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:57,238
Okay, after this drink,
I have to go home.

712
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,372
Jim.

713
00:35:58,448 --> 00:36:02,294
There's a smoking hot 18-year-old girl
over there that you used to babysit.

714
00:36:02,452 --> 00:36:04,420
And you're not going to
do anything about that?

715
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,673
Need I remind you that
I am married to Michelle?

716
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:07,749
Exactly.

717
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:13,631
Dude, these young chicks, they know
some crazy shit in the bedroom.

718
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,013
You could take what
you learn from Kara,

719
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,769
bring it home,
and apply it to Michelle.

720
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:23,098
You do care about your
marriage, don't you, Jim?

721
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:24,766
What are you talking
about, Stifler?

722
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,022
I'm not gonna cheat on my wife!

723
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,187
I'm a father
for Christ's sakes.

724
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,356
Yeah, that's perfect.

725
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:34,151
Yeah, chicks love a father figure.
Keep playing that card, dude.

726
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,490
It's not a card,
it's the truth.

727
00:36:36,653 --> 00:36:38,030
Hey. Hi.

728
00:36:38,113 --> 00:36:39,456
What are you guys
talking about?

729
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,784
Oh, you know... Just“

730
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,375
Jim was just saying how much
fun he had taking care of you.

731
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,165
Hey, ladies, why don't we give
them some time to catch up?

732
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,420
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, after you.

733
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,797
No, that's not necessary.
We should all hang out together.

734
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,553
Why don't we all...
Stifler, just...

735

Be her daddy.

736
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,137
Stifler? Stifler!

737
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:05,141
So, sounds like you and Mia have
quite an adventurous lifestyle.

738
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,726
Sometimes a little
too adventurous.

739
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:12,398
Wow. Well, Heather's a bit
more on the conservative side.

740
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,481
But, uh...

741
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:14,987
Hey! Hi.

742
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,663
But, I gotta be honest, Chris, I
could use a little adventure myself.

743
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:22,703
What are you getting at, Ron?

744
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:27,588
I'm just saying that usually
I'm not one for swapping,

745
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:33,003
but the fact that you've been with
Heather already, kind of makes it okay.

746
00:37:33,835 --> 00:37:36,588
So, what do you think?

747
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:38,923
Think they'd be into it?

748
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,723
I'm kidding.
Come on, I'm kidding!

Seriously,
I would never do that!

Unless you guys wanted to.

752
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,854
So you've really been to every
country in South America?

753

No, no, not all of them.

754
00:37:55,106 --> 00:37:58,201
And I don't consider
French Guiana a nation.

755
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,202
I remember, I couldn't
wait till graduation

756
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:06,288
so I could leave this town
and reinvent myself.

757
00:38:06,576 --> 00:38:09,170
You have certainly
reinvented yourself.

758
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,337
I don't know.

759

There's just a part of me
that still wishes that

760
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:15,130
I could just explore
the world, you know?

Be everything I set out to be.

You just gotta be it.

Are you crazy?
I love the Twilight books.

on your own dick?

nothing.

1597
01:17:48,221 --> 01:17:50,770
Thanks a lot.

1598
01:17:51,182 --> 01:17:53,685
No, no, Kara, wait.
I didn't mean...

1599
01:17:53,851 --> 01:17:55,569
Wait, Michelle.
Hold on, hold on.

1600
01:17:55,728 --> 01:17:57,150
It's not what you think, okay?

1601
01:17:57,313 --> 01:18:01,819
I swear, I was just trying to
do the right thing, and I...

1602
01:18:01,901 --> 01:18:04,529
(SIGHS) You have to believe
me, Michelle, please.

1603
01:18:05,446 --> 01:18:08,575
Whether I believe you or not,

1604
01:18:08,783 --> 01:18:10,160
I'm disappointed.

1605
01:18:10,576 --> 01:18:13,045
I'm going to stay
with my grandmother.

1606
01:18:13,204 --> 01:18:14,205
Hold it, Michelle.

1607
01:18:14,288 --> 01:18:15,289
No, Jim.

1608
01:18:15,915 --> 01:18:17,462
Hey, the fight's over, guys.

1609
01:18:17,625 --> 01:18:19,047
We're not here to stop a fight.

1610
01:18:19,293 --> 01:18:21,637
We're here about
that stolen motorcycle.

1611
01:18:21,796 --> 01:18:23,469
Looks like the VIN
numbers match up.

1612
01:18:23,631 --> 01:18:24,883
Paul Finch.

1613
01:18:25,049 --> 01:18:26,801
You're under arrest.

1614
01:18:28,136 --> 01:18:29,388
Awesome!

KEVIN: Excuse me, officer.

1616
01:18:30,972 --> 01:18:33,248
He won that bike betting on
the World Cup in Argentina.

1617
01:18:33,249 --> 01:18:35,523
You made some sort of mistake.

1618
01:18:35,601 --> 01:18:37,569
Paul, what's going on?
What is this about?

1619
01:18:37,854 --> 01:18:39,026
Paul.

1620
01:18:39,188 --> 01:18:40,485
Finch, just tell them.

1621
01:18:40,648 --> 01:18:41,820
Paul!

getting rammed by your cellmate tonight,

1623
01:18:46,738 --> 01:18:47,864
think of Kevin.

1624
01:18:51,909 --> 01:18:53,911
Michelle, can I just... Please!

1625
01:18:57,832 --> 01:18:58,879
Oh!

(CROWD EXCLAIMING)

1630
01:19:09,260 --> 01:19:10,682
Dad, what are you doing?

1631
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:13,598
You didn't see me!
I'm not here!

I'm not here!

Is he all right?

1634

I don't know.

1635
01:19:20,521 --> 01:19:22,023
What are we going
to do about Finch?

1636
01:19:22,190 --> 01:19:24,443
Fuck Finch. Let him
spend the night in jail.

1637
01:19:24,609 --> 01:19:25,826
Come on, Stifler!

1638
01:19:25,902 --> 01:19:27,119
Some friend you are.

1639
01:19:29,447 --> 01:19:30,915
What about you guys?

1640
01:19:31,115 --> 01:19:34,164
You don't call me,
you don't e-mail,

1641

you don't comment
on my Facebook page.

1642
01:19:36,454 --> 01:19:38,752
You guys didn't even let me know you
were coming back for the reunion.

1643
01:19:38,915 --> 01:19:42,215
Because we knew, somehow, you would
find a way to screw things up.

1644
01:19:42,710 --> 01:19:44,383
Oh, I'm sorry, Jim.

1645
01:19:44,545 --> 01:19:46,138
I wanted us to have
a fucking fun time

1646
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:47,716
this weekend,
like we did in high school.

1647
01:19:47,882 --> 01:19:49,884
But we're not in
high school any more.

1648
01:19:50,051 --> 01:19:51,553
You are so trapped
in the past, Stifler.

1649
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:54,768
When are you going to realize that things
will never be the way they used to be?

Fine.

Guess the party's over.

I honestly think I had fun.

Well, that makes one of us.

Have you heard from Michelle?

1659
01:20:55,825 --> 01:20:59,079
No. She doesn't
want to talk to me.

1660
01:20:59,370 --> 01:21:01,168
What about the reunion tonight?

1661
01:21:01,247 --> 01:21:03,375
She said she may
or may not come.

What's going on with you two?

Jim, is there anything
you want to talk about?

(CLEARS THROAT)

1665
01:21:11,090 --> 01:21:12,262
Okay.

Um...

1667
01:21:15,344 --> 01:21:17,938
How often

1668
01:21:18,097 --> 01:21:21,442
did you and Mom...

1669
01:21:24,604 --> 01:21:25,901
You know?

1670
01:21:25,980 --> 01:21:28,074
Is that what this is about?

1671
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:29,992
You and Michelle
haven't been...

1672
01:21:30,151 --> 01:21:31,994
Not lately, no.

1673
01:21:32,069 --> 01:21:33,116
Oh...

1674
01:21:35,656 --> 01:21:37,499
ls it

1675
01:21:37,658 --> 01:21:39,160
an erectile problem?

1676
01:21:39,994 --> 01:21:44,340
Because sometimes you
can buy a little time

1677
01:21:44,498 --> 01:21:45,795
with a well-placed thumb.

1678

Oh, God. I'm just saying.

1679
01:21:47,835 --> 01:21:49,712
I don't think that's it.
That's not it?

1680
01:21:50,004 --> 01:21:54,805
Oh! That's something to keep in your
back pocket, because that's a no-fail.

1681
01:21:54,967 --> 01:21:56,640
Okay, let's be done with that.

1682
01:21:56,802 --> 01:22:00,227
No, things in that
department were fine.

1683
01:22:01,432 --> 01:22:03,526
And then Evan was born

1684
01:22:03,726 --> 01:22:06,605
and we kind of stopped.

1685
01:22:06,854 --> 01:22:10,700
And they haven't really
picked up since, you know?

1686
01:22:11,484 --> 01:22:14,738
This is not a problem,
so do not worry.

You understand?
Yeah, listen, Jim.

Before you were born,

1689
01:22:18,407 --> 01:22:21,377

we would do it every day.

1690

I don't need this.

Sometimes two or
three times a day.

A lot of experimentation was going on.

called, "diving for dollars."

I don't need...

1695
01:22:36,676 --> 01:22:39,054
(CLEARS THROAT)
That's fine, we can...

1696
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,472
I don't have to
go on with that.

1697
01:22:40,554 --> 01:22:46,027
But my point is, when you have a
kid, you become a dad and a mom.

1698
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:50,615
But it's very important not to
stop being a husband and a wife.

1699
01:22:51,190 --> 01:22:54,740
And if you do that,
the sex will come.

1700
01:22:56,821 --> 01:22:58,289
That actually
makes a lot of sense.

1701
01:22:58,447 --> 01:23:01,826
But you can't just wait for
the two of you to be alone.

You have to make
your own alone time.

Why do you think you went to
Hebrew school three times a week?

Tuesdays, four to seven?

1705

Okay, I get it, Dad.

then why the questions?

I should be listening.

department a thousand times.

01:24:16,275 --> 01:24:21,156
I appreciate that, Kevin.
But my mom, actually, bailed me out.

That bike belongs to my boss.

And I was promised a raise,
and I didn't get it, so I

simply borrowed it.

isn't interesting at all.

and I'm sorry.

1736
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:48,316
You know, Finch,
just because you sold out

1737
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:51,394
and got a boring job
like most of us,

1738
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:53,104
that doesn't mean you
should be embarrassed.

Yeah, come on, man.
None of that shit matters.

We asked your mom.

Oh, no. I didn't do anything.

1760

We wanted to apologize
for what we said last night.

Yeah, you did.
I get it, you guys think I'm a dick.

1764
01:26:18,939 --> 01:26:21,237
Okay. Well,

1765
01:26:22,109 --> 01:26:24,532
maybe you are kind of a dick.

1766

But,

1767

you're a fun dick.

Yeah, man. You were one of the biggest
reasons that high school was awesome.

Yeah, high school was awesome.

Then we graduated and everybody
started getting jobs

and getting married
and having kids

going, and hit up this reunion together?

No, Kevin.

1784
01:27:18,666 --> 01:27:19,758
Allow me.

1785
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:22,461
Yeah, Kevin, allow him.

(SCOFFS) Oh, wow.
Who the hell do you think you are?

Are you acting tough in front
of your girlfriend? Huh?

1790
01:27:34,431 --> 01:27:36,433
Because we both know she's
only with you for your money.

Definitely not for your dick.

true." Oh, yeah, it is.

office and I don't even have a desk

1798
01:27:54,545 --> 01:27:56,843
doesn't change
who we really are.

The truth is,
you're still a dork,

thought much about that.

Seeing you again, all these
old feelings came up, and...

01:33:46,596 --> 01:33:49,315
I don't know, I guess
I just felt guilty.

1913
01:33:50,183 --> 01:33:54,359
But the fact that I still
have feelings for you

1914
01:33:54,521 --> 01:33:57,274
just means that what
we had was special.

2071
01:42:41,631 --> 01:42:42,678
MILF.

2072
01:42:46,427 --> 01:42:47,770
STIFLER: Tell me I'm the best.

2073
01:42:47,845 --> 01:42:49,518
RACHEL: You are the best!

2074
01:42:50,348 --> 01:42:51,395
MILF.

2075
01:42:52,642 --> 01:42:54,019
MILF. MILF.

2076
01:42:55,645 --> 01:42:56,862
STIFLER: Oh, Finch's mom!

2077
01:42:57,480 --> 01:43:02,486
BOTH: MILF! MILF! MILF!

2078
01:43:02,860 --> 01:43:04,783
(CHEERING)

2079
01:43:04,862 --> 01:43:06,330
RACHEL: Yes! Yes!

2080
01:43:06,405 --> 01:43:07,827
STIFLER: Oh, your
son's such a dork!

2081
01:43:07,907 --> 01:43:09,830
Stop talking about him!

2082
01:43:09,909 --> 01:43:11,252
(RACHEL SCREAMING)

2083
01:43:12,244 --> 01:43:14,918
Well, our first reunion
is officially in the books.

2084
01:43:15,081 --> 01:43:18,301
I don't know about you guys, but
my night ended pretty well.

2085
01:43:18,459 --> 01:43:19,551
It was great.

2086
01:43:19,627 --> 01:43:20,970
I had a blast.
It was unforgettable.

2087
01:43:21,045 --> 01:43:22,763
Fuck yeah!
I jizzed like a racehorse.

2088
01:43:23,464 --> 01:43:25,137
What happened to you at the
end of the night, Stifler?

2089
01:43:25,216 --> 01:43:26,513
Who did you end up with?

2090
01:43:26,592 --> 01:43:29,345
A gentleman never
kisses and tells, Jim.

2091
01:43:32,223 --> 01:43:33,270
JIM: Guys?

2092
01:43:35,351 --> 01:43:37,228
I'll be right back, okay?

2093
01:43:41,148 --> 01:43:42,240
Kara!

2094
01:43:48,781 --> 01:43:50,875
HEY-HEY...

2095
01:43:51,659 --> 01:43:54,333
Look, I'm sorry about
what I said the other night.

2096
01:43:54,495 --> 01:43:57,874
No, I'm the one who
should be apologizing.

2097
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:00,168
I can't believe the way I acted.
I'm so embarrassed.

2098
01:44:00,251 --> 01:44:01,798
Don't be.

2099
01:44:02,211 --> 01:44:05,511
When I was your age I was
pretty obsessed with sex, too.

2100
01:44:05,589 --> 01:44:06,681
I know.

2101
01:44:07,717 --> 01:44:08,809
I've seen the YouTube clip.

2102
01:44:09,301 --> 01:44:11,770
Oh, of course you did.

2103
01:44:11,929 --> 01:44:14,148
But, thanks for understanding.

2104
01:44:14,306 --> 01:44:17,105
I was thinking about it,
and you're right.

2105
01:44:17,268 --> 01:44:18,895
I should really wait
for someone special.

2106
01:44:20,604 --> 01:44:23,608
Just, it's going to be tough
to find a guy as good as you.

2107
01:44:27,028 --> 01:44:28,120
I'm sure you will.

2108
01:44:34,952 --> 01:44:37,046
I feel like a whole new
man after this weekend.

2109
01:44:37,121 --> 01:44:38,589
Kind of sucks
we have to leave, though.

2110
01:44:38,664 --> 01:44:41,793
Not me. I'm going to take
some time off my job

2111
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:43,719
and stick around here
with Heather for a while.

2112
01:44:43,794 --> 01:44:44,886
Nice!

2113
01:44:44,962 --> 01:44:46,088
What about you, Finch?

2114
01:44:46,172 --> 01:44:49,392
Selena and I, we're planning
a little jaunt to Europe.

2115
01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:52,144
Just make sure you call your mom.
She misses you.

2116
01:44:53,012 --> 01:44:54,389
How would you know?

2117
01:44:54,764 --> 01:44:55,765
(CHUCKLES)

2118
01:44:56,182 --> 01:44:57,183
Oh...

2119
01:45:00,311 --> 01:45:02,234
I guess this is it, huh?
Back to reality?

2120
01:45:02,396 --> 01:45:04,148
We shouldn't wait
until the next reunion.

2121
01:45:04,315 --> 01:45:07,410
We should try to get
together every year.

2122
01:45:07,526 --> 01:45:10,154
What do you say,
until next time?

2123
01:45:10,237 --> 01:45:12,410
Until next time.
Until next time!

2124
01:45:22,124 --> 01:45:23,421
(MIMICKING COUGH)
I fucked Finch's mom.

2125
01:45:23,542 --> 01:45:24,839
What?

2126
01:45:24,960 --> 01:45:26,303
What was that?

2127
01:45:41,519 --> 01:45:43,772
(OPERATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

2128
01:46:44,331 --> 01:46:46,083
(BREATH ES HEAVILY)

2129
01:46:48,377 --> 01:46:49,378
Hmm?

2130
01:46:50,045 --> 01:46:51,422
What's this?

2131
01:46:52,756 --> 01:46:54,508
Oh, no, dean No, no, no.

2132
01:46:54,675 --> 01:46:56,518
No, dear. No! (UNZIPPING)

2133
01:46:56,594 --> 01:46:57,595
Oh!

2134
01:47:03,475 --> 01:47:04,476
Oh...

2135
01:47:05,227 --> 01:47:08,276
Oh. Oh. Oh.

2136
01:47:08,522 --> 01:47:11,867
Ah. Oh. Oh.

2137
01:47:12,276 --> 01:47:15,155
Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

2138
01:47:15,362 --> 01:47:17,456
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

2139
01:47:18,115 --> 01:47:19,708
Oh! Oh!

2140
01:47:19,783 --> 01:47:21,831
Oh, my God!

2141
01:47:22,203 --> 01:47:23,625
Ah! (LAUGHING)

2142
01:47:26,415 --> 01:47:27,416
(SIGHS)

2143
01:47:27,833 --> 01:47:28,686
(CLEARS THROAT)

2144
01:47:28,687 --> 01:47:29,426
Great movie.

2145
01:47:33,767 --> 01:47:40,467
