1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:06,490
我的意识要我说不
My mind is tellin me no

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,670
但是我的身体  我的身体却在叫我说好
but my body, my body's tellin me yes

3
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:20,580
宝贝  我不想伤害任何人
Baby, I don't want to hurt nobody

4
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:30,450
但是有些事情我必须坦白
But there is something that I must confess

5
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,410
有点小小的磕磕碰碰
I don't see nothing wrong

6
00:00:36,190 --> 00:00:38,220
我觉得没什么不好
with a little bump and grind

7
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:43,290
有点小小的磕磕碰碰
I don't see nothing wrong

8
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,850
他睡着了没
Is he asleep yet?

9
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,600
睡着了  我去把他放床上
Yeah, I'll go put him to bed.

10
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,020
罗伯特?凯利真是屡试不爽
R. Kelly always does the trick.

11
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,150
我觉得伊凡可能在发疹
I think Evan may be developing a rash.

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,490
你给他的屁股涂婴儿润肤膏时
You know, when you rub the Aquaphor on his tush,

13
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:19,070
不能只涂在臀瓣上
you can't just put it on his cheeks,

14
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,240
肛门上也得整个涂满
you have to rub it all over the anus, too.

15
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,330
整个肛门  明白了
All over the anus, got it.

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,040
我先去洗个澡吧
I think I'm going to take a bath, okay?

17
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,880
去洗吧  宝贝
Okay, babe. Go for it.

18

你喜欢淫荡点的  是吗
Oh, yeah, you like it nasty, don't you?

23
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,380

Oh, I do. I do, I'm sorry. Guilty as charged.

吉姆?莱文斯汀

是的  伙计  上你的脸书看看
Yeah, man, check your Facebook.

58
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,240

59
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,830

I heard Finch's mom doesn't even know where he is.

你觉得我不知道自己在说什么吗
You think I don't know what I'm talking about?

89
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,730
帮个忙  看看带子

你在担心德尚吗
You are worried about Deshaun?

104

Maybe next time, Deshaun.

109
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,910
我还是不明白为什么需要一个室内设计师
I still don't get why we need an interior decorator.

110
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,210
"造型"杂志要过来拍照  所以得弄的漂亮点

Remember how you didn't wanna go on Celebrity Dance Off at first?

130
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,280
雇你们来  可不是因为你们脸蛋漂亮
you weren't hired for your looks.

131
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,030
其实  就是因为你们漂亮的脸蛋
Actually, you were.

132
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,660
不是说你
Not you.

133
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,950
搞什么鬼
Seriously?

134
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
鲍勃  你还在这干嘛

要加"伴侣"的话记得告诉我一声
Let me know if you want some creamer with that.

142
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,900
嗨  你还好吗
Hello, you. How are you?

143

- Oh, I am the best. - Yes, you are the...

146
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,850
我可爱死你了
You know, I love you so much.

147
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,780
我下面要爽爽了
That I'm going to just have some fun down here.

148
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,660
-你他妈在干什么  -天哪
- What the hell are you doing? - Jesus Christ!

149
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,250
该死  对不起  度莱斯瓦米先生
Shit, sorry, Mr. Duraiswamy.

150
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:21,040
我只是...
It's... I was just...

151
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,160
好了  物归原位
That's good, it's all clean.

152
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,520
我吩咐过你打印出早上的报表
I told you to print out

153
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,000
放在我的桌子上
the morning numbers and put them on my desk,

154
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,630
你却把这当你家了啊
and you're making yourself at home?

155
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,540
-不  我只是想  -"我只是想"
- No, I just thought... - "I just thought..."

156
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,090
我付钱不是请你来空想的  你只是个临时工
I don't pay you to think. You are a temp.

157
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,430
关于那个  我觉得我被大材小用了
Yeah, about that. I feel like I'm being way underutilized here.

158
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,840
这就是你的想法  是吗
Oh, you do, do you?

159
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,930
多谢你告诉我你是怎么想的
Thank you for telling me how you feel.

160
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,720
你不介意听我说我是怎么想的吧
Do you mind if I tell you how I feel?

161
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:44,940
我觉得越早你认识到自己是个奴才
I feel the sooner you realize that you're the bitch,

162
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:47,020
而不是主子
not the boss,

163
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,400
你日子就能过得越好
the better off you will be.

164
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,820
-傻逼  -你说什么
- Fucker. - What was that?

165
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,110
没什么
Nothing!

166
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,410
没什么  度莱斯瓦米先生
Nothing, Mr. Duraiswamy.

167
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,240
傻逼
Fucker!

168
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,570
欢迎来到东大瀑布镇

169
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:09,170
我们还没谈谈
You know, we still haven't discussed the whole

170
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,550
浴缸事件
bathtub incident.

171
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,710
那个啊  那个...
Oh, that? That's...

172
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,050
那个  不用担心
That... Don't worry about that.

173
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,970
我意思是  很明显
Well, I mean, you know, obviously,

174
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,680
我很希望我是那个
I would prefer it if I was the one

175
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,020
能让你性奋的人  但是...
that made you feel that way, but...

176
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,690
我知道的你的感受
I know how you feel.

177
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:30,860
每次我要网购  搜索"亚马逊"的时候
Every time I want to shop online and I start typing "Amazon,"

178
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,530
一个叫"劲爆大学骚货"的网址就弹了出来
"Amazingcollegesluts.Com" Pops up.

179
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,450
"劲爆"什么
Amazing what?

180
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,910
好吧  很明显
Okay, look, obviously

181
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,580
我们两个是应该多找些乐子
we need to have more fun together.

182
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,540
我保证  就这个周末
I promise you, this weekend,

183
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,050
会有很多二人时光  好吗

Hello, son! Come here.

188
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:13,730

Oh, no! Look who that is!

189
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,440
瞧这壮小伙啊
Look at this big bruiser! Oh, my goodness!

191
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,780
还穿着尿不湿呢
Someone's got a little poopy diaper.

192
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,030
吉姆
Jim?

193
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,530
真不敢相信是你
I can't believe it's you.

194
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:06,870
不记得我了吧  是不是
You don't remember me, do you?

195
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:10,370
还记得天线宝宝周二会吗
Uh... Remember Teletubby Tuesdays?

196
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,920
凯菈
Kara?

197
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,750
天哪
Oh, my God.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:19,420
啊  你都长这么大了
What? You're not a kid anymore.

199
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,050
我早就不是小孩子了
It's been a long time since I needed a babysitter.

200
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:26,100
真不敢相信你都长这么大了
I can't believe how much you've grown up.

201
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,310
谢谢
Thanks!

202
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,390
实际上明天就是我十八岁生日了
It's actually my 18th birthday tomorrow.

203

Eighteen, wow.

204

你应该来我的派对
You should come to my party.

205
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,560
谢谢你  但是可能有点困难
Thank you, no. I... Yeah, that might be difficult.

206
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,520
求你了  我很想你能来
Please, I want you to come so bad.

207
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,110

00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,370

210
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,540
希望明天可以见到你
Hopefully I will see you tomorrow.

211
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:52,120
那人他妈的是谁
Who the fuck was that?

212
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,880
甜心
Hey, sweetie.

213
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,210
你在跟谁说话
Who were you talking to?

214
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,800
邻家的小孩子
That was just the kid next door.

215
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,620
你好  我的老朋友
Hello, my old friends.

216
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,000
我差点没把它们扔了
I thought about throwing them out,

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,420
但是它们的情感价值太重了
but they just have too much sentimental value.

218
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:42,630
是啊
Yeah.

219
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,260
哦  吉姆  吉姆  吉姆
Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim.

220
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:52,350
我还记得你孩子时候的样子
You know, I can remember when you were just a little guy.

221
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,430
现在你都有自己的孩子了
And now you've got your own little guy.

222
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,600
我知道
I know.

223
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:58,400
你都还没发觉  他很快就长成青少年了
And before you know it, he's gonna be a teenager...

224
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:03,110
你会教他怎么手淫
And you'll be teaching him about masturbation

225
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:05,780
还有那些关于小家伙鸡鸡
and, you know, all the do's and all the don'ts

226
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,200
能做的和不能做的
that have to do with the little guy's weenie.

227
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
对吧
Okay. Right?

228
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,320
希望他到了青少年的年纪
Hopefully, it'll be more

229
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,120
他的小香肠能大一些
of a bratwurst by the time he's a teenager...

230
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,410
好吧  爸爸  我明白  但是...
Okay, Dad, I get it. ...but I'm just...

231
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,000
你总得面对这些事情
Well, these are things you're gonna have to deal with.

232
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,750
我明白  只是现在有点早  他才两岁
I understand. It's just, you know, he's two.

233
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:17,670
对  或许还早  但是
Well, yeah, maybe you've got time, but...

234
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:20,710
我只是  不想再谈论他的小鸡鸡
So, you know, I just, I'd rather not talk about his penis.

235
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,920
-最近好吗  爸爸  -我很好
- How you doing, Dad? - I'm good.

236
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:26,090
有什么娱乐活动  最近有看什么电影吗
Yeah? What are you doing for fun? You seen any movies lately?

237
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,890
是的  我过去常和你妈一起看电影
Well, you know, your mother and I did go to a lot of movies.

238
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:38,230
妈妈都过世三年了
You know, it has been three years since she passed, Dad.

239
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,570
在镇子里  总能找个能陪你看电影的人吧
There's gotta be someone in town you can see a movie with.

240
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,540
现在不是有你了吗
I have you now.

241
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,030
我们今晚去看电影  你和我
We'll see a movie tonight, you and me.

242
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,070
今晚吗
Tonight?

243
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,860
我和那些老朋友有约
Well, I made plans with the guys,

244
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,660
晚上在酒吧见

245
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,910
-但是...  -也是  也是
- But... - Yeah, yeah...

246
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:54,660
但我没必要今天就去  明天也可以
But I don't need to do that. I can do that tomorrow.

247
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,410
别  别  你就是为了聚会回来的  是吧
No. No, no, no, no. This is why you're in town, isn't it?

248
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,830
没事  你去吧  我没事的
No, no, no. You go. I'll be fine.

249
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,130
我打算今晚待在家里
I was just planning on staying in tonight

250
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,920
做一些阅读的工作
and, you know, doing a little reading.

251
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,430
不是看这个  当然不是
Oh, not this. No. No.

252
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:15,600
不过  我还记得里面有篇很有趣的文章
Although, I do remember reading a very interesting article

253
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,600
带有巴西风情的
on something Brazilian.

254
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,190

So, after my troubles in Beijing, I just moved to Dubai,

276
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,140
然后就沉迷于
and then I got all caught

277
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:30,090
地下赌牌
up in the world of underground baccarat.

278
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,550
然后跟这个非洲部落度过了剩下的零九年
Spent the rest of 09 living with this African tribe.

279
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,810
他们还让我当了他们的荣誉族人
Oh, they made me an honorary tribesman.

280
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,350
看起来很痛的样子
Whoa, that looks like it hurt.

281
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,520
看上去痛是因为它确实很痛  凯文
It looks like that because it did hurt, Kevin.

282
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,690
然后就一直骑自行车环游南美
Since then, I've just been biking through South America.

283
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,780
你估计是这世界上最有意思的人了吧
So, basically, you are the most interesting man in the world.

284
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,030
-是啊  -我猜猜
- Yeah. - Let me guess,

285
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,660
你们来这里重聚是吧
you guys are here for the reunion, huh?

286
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,820
猜对了 99级学生
You got it. Class of 99.

287
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,530
我之前是不是见过你
Haven't I seen you before?

288
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,790
对  我是电视主持
Yeah, I'm on TV.

289
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,330
不  不是你  是你
No, not you. You.

290
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,880
你的脸  很熟悉
'Cause, your face, you're just so familiar.

291
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,630
对了  这是你  是吧
Yeah! Yeah, this is you, right?

292
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,630
-我的天  -是娜迪亚
- Oh, Man! - Nadia!

293
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,180
更多  更多  你这坏小伙
More, more, you bad boy!

294
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,470
我发誓我把它们都弄下来了  你是怎么
I swear I had these all taken down. How did you...

295
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,640
对了  你早泄了几次来着
Oh, yeah. How many times did you pre-ejaculate again?

296
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,180
放了他吧
Oh, leave him alone.

297
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:24,350
我打赌你们那时候都还是饥渴的处男
I bet you were all desperate virgins back then.

298
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,230
塞琳娜?维嘉
Selena Vega.

299
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:32,650
-塞琳娜?维嘉就站在我们面前  -等等  塞琳娜
- That's Selena Vega in front of us. - Wait, wait, wait, Selena...

300
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,740
你是米雪乐队里的那个朋友
Hold on, Michelle's friend from band?

301
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:35,820
你猜对了
You got it.

302
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,700
天哪  很抱歉没认出你来
Oh, my God. I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

303
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,660
你看起来  大不一样了
You look... different.

304
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,660
下一轮我请  好吗  伙计们
Well, next round's on me, okay, guys?

305
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,830
这妞原来竟是乐团的
Hey, that chick was in band?

306
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:48,410
听我说  我这么长时间来
Look, this is the first long weekend

307
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,420
好不容易能有个双休日
I have had in a while,

308
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,750
所以一秒都不能浪费
so I wanna make it count.

309
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:54,050
我要家里一尘不染  酒池肉林
I want the place spotless, and I want it filled with booze.

310
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,130
我要你周日晚上把房子腾出来
And I wanna make sure you're not around on Sunday night,

311
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,180
因为我要带些重聚的老伙计回来
'cause I plan on bringing some ass back from the reunion,

312
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:00,850
我希望你到时候  别在那添乱  明白了吗
and I wanna tap that without you there. You got it?

313
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,270
斯蒂文  第一点  这是我的房子
You know, first of all, Steven, it's my house.

314
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,060
我还让你住在这  是你小子走运
You're lucky I'm letting you stay here.

315
00:17:06,350 --> 00:17:08,360
你让我找个工作  我不是找了吗
Look, you wanted me to get a job, so I got one.

316
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,190
至少让我周末好好聚聚吧
At least let me have the house for the weekend.

317
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,610
我的房子  我做主
My house, my rules.

318
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,070
至于今晚  如果你不想回家后
And as for tonight, if you don't wanna risk coming home

319
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,860
看到什么不该看到的事
and seeing more of your mother than you'd like,

320
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,700
我建议你还是晚点回来吧
I suggest you stay out late.

321
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:22,990
真恶心
Gross.

322
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,290
这真是...
That was really...

323
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:30,670
酒保妹  来杯百威
Hey, bar wench, can I get a Budweiser?

324
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,470
干杯
Beer down.

325
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:40,350
你们这帮贱人在这干嘛
What the fuck are you fuckers doing here?

326
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,020
-你也来了  -来什么
- You made it! - Made what?

327
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,150
你们在说什么
What are you talking about?

328
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:53,230
你什么意思  我们发了邮件给你
What do you mean? We sent you an e-mail

329
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,110
在聚会之前的一两天先聚一下
about getting together a couple of days before the reunion.

330
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,200
我肯定是在大屌硬条这个词里打了两个"F"
You know what? I must have put two F's in "Stifmeister."

331
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,780
-什么  -很抱歉
- What? - I'm sorry.

332
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:08,000
两个F  你这傻逼
Two F's? You dumb-ass!

333
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,370
凯文
Kev!

334
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,330
凯文  你脸上长的是阴门吗
Hey, Kevin, is that a pussy on your face?

335
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,790
得了
Oh, come on!

336
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,880
正点
Nice.

337
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,630
硬条  看起来不错啊
So, Stifler, you're looking sharp.

338
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,130
最近在哪风光
What are you up to these days?

339
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,600
我在JBH环球公司上班
I work at JBH Global.

340
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,680
这可是大公司啊
Wow! That's a big-time firm.

341
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,930
具体是什么职位
What do you do over there?

342
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:27,180
你知道的
Oh, you know,

343
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:29,350
就是投资一类的东西
investment stuff.

344
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,190
难怪我们的金融系统崩溃了
People wonder why our financial system's falling apart.

345
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,320
围巾不错  你终于出柜了
Nice scarf. I see you finally came out of the closet.

346
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,030
硬条  你老妈还好吧
How is your mother, Stifler?

347
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,900
你这狗屎  离我妈远点
You stay away from my mom, shitbreak.

348
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,570
好了 过去的都过去了
Okay, boys, the past is the past.

349
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,280
先和解好吗
We can bury the hatchet here, huh?

350
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,040
是啊  去他的
Yeah, fuck it.

351
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,950
热裤妹  给我们所有人来一轮野格炸弹
Hey, short-shorts! A round of J?gerbombs for me and my boys!

352
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,460
去你妈的  硬条
Go fuck yourself, Stifler.

353
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,000
她怎么知道我名字
How the hell does she know my name?

354
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:55,050
肘子妞
Lard Arms?

355
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,300
天哪  硬条
Jesus, Stifler.

356
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,340
我们在谈一个丑小鸭变白天鹅的事  是吗
Talk about an ugly duckling turning into a swan, right?

357
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,340
让我看看
Let me see that.

358
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:05,870
从前揉过她的道
Oh! Fingered her,

359
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,770
这个是毛乳头  这个是奶子大
hairy nips, huge boobs.

360
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,610
找到她了
There she is!

361
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,730
我老二尝过的极品美味
The crème de my cock.

362
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,570
吹箫皇后小莱
Blowjob Lipstein.

363
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:21,070
硬条  人家本名是萝妮
Her given name was Loni, Stifler.

364
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,950
她原来总叫我大硬条
She used to call me Big Stiffy.

365
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,950
那可真是一张叫我魂牵梦萦的嘴啊
She was the mouth that got away.

366
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,160
最后一轮
Last call!

367
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,460
这么快  伙计们等着
Already? Wait here, guys.

368
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:35,920
看看这个  高中愿望单
Oh! Man, the Senior Wish List.

369
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,620
你觉得自己的未来是什么样的

370
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:38,050
愿望单  我不记得这东西了
Wish List? I don't remember that.

371
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:40,840
那可是年鉴里俗气的一页
Oh, yeah, man. It's that cheesy page in the yearbook

372
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:43,050
我们在那上面书写了对未来的愿望
where we all had to write wishes about our future.

373
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,010
是吗  我来瞧瞧  你写了什么俗气的东西
What, did you write something cheesy? Let's see.

374
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,720
克里斯?奥斯莱克
"Chris Ostreicher.

375
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,930
希望成为他儿子的曲棍球队教练
Hopes to coach his son's lacrosse team."

376
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:53,230
这不是很甜蜜吗
Oh! Isn't that the sweetest thing?

377
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:54,520
好吧
Well,

378
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,730
我猜我当时想着到现在应该有家庭了
I guess I thought I'd have a family by now.

379
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,110
想听听你写了些什么吗  芬治
All right, you wanna hear what you wrote, Finch?

380
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,280
当然
I do.

381
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:04,240
保罗?芬治希望找到"le grand amour"
"Paul Finch hopes to find le grand amour."

382
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,530
没错  真爱
Yes, true love.

383
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:11,250
然而我连你们所谓的稳定关系都还没找到
Alas, I have yet to find what you would call a real relationship.

384
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,040
对  毕竟上硬条的老妈不算
Right, because banging Stifler's mom didn't count.

385
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,250
凯文  来看看你写了什么
All right, let's see what you got, Kev.

386
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,840
凯文?迈尔斯希望可以和
"Kevin Myers. Hopes to still be living it up

387
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,090
迷人的碧琪?兰森天长地久
with the amazing Vicky Lathum."

388
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,550
-天哪  -碧琪  真的假的
- Oh, man! - Vicky! What?

389
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:28,010
我肯定你老婆听到这个会很高兴
I am sure your wife would be very happy to read that.

390
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,930
什么呀  我那时候正在和碧琪约会
What? I was dating Vicky at the time.

391
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,430
我看看我写了什么
Let me see what I put.

392
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,900
吉姆?莱文斯汀
"Jim Levenstein

393
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,070
希望能过着里奇?马丁式的性爱生活"
Hopes to have the sex life of Ricky Martin."

394
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,910
我猜你当年还不知道他是基佬吧
So, I'm assuming you didn't know he was gay back then.

395
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,660
吉姆  多亏你找了个
Jim, it's a good thing you found a woman

396
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,580
性欲旺盛的女人
with the sex drive of a dozen groupies. Hmm?

397
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
我想你做的爱  比我们都多
I mean, you're probably having more sex than any of us.

398
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,340
这种事哪有准头
Probably, you know.

399
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,510
希望你们都渴了  硬条大爷我来了
Hope you guys are thirsty. Stifler Claus is here.

400
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:06,260
硬条  你不觉得这有点多了吗
Whoa! Stifler, that's a little too much, don't you think?

401
00:21:06,430 --> 00:21:08,510
伙计  爷们点  放胆喝
Dude, find your balls and return them to your sack.

402
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,680
要我说  派对继续
I say we keep this party going.

403
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,680
这个周末我们要无法无天
I say we make this weekend our bitch.

404
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,160
我们可以一起聚会
We could party together,

405
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,310
干过去一起干过的那些疯事
do all the same shit that we used to do together.

406
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,810
一切都将是昨日重现
It'll be just like old times.

407
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,650
没错  我就是为了这个来的
Hell yes! That's why I'm here.

408
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,320
没有"单身女郎"  没有"家庭主妇"
No Bachelorette, no Real Housewives.

409
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:27,030
十三年的重聚仅此一次
Thing is, you only get one chance at your 13th reunion.

410
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,580
老实说  我有点想回去跟我老婆甜蜜一下
I was kind of hoping to spend a little time with the wife.

411
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,700
-操  -伙计
- Fuck! - Dude!

412
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:36,160
-詹姆斯  -行了吧你
- James? - What? Come on!

413
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,000
好吧  我加入  我当然加入  什么大不了的
I mean, I'm in. Of course I'm in. Come on, what?

414
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,920
那么各位  我希望你们的套子都戴好了
Then, gentlemen, I hope you're all wearing protection,

415
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,130
因为这个周末  我们要疯他个天昏地暗
because this weekend, we're gonna fuck shit up!

416
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:47,970
-干杯  -干了
- Cheers! - Yeah! All right!

417
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,620
怎么回事
What the fuck?

418
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,160
该死
Holy shit.

419
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:23,670
怎么回事
What happened?

420
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,420
我记不大清了
I don't really remember.

421
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:32,510
都怪你  你昨晚让他喝了多少
I blame you. How much did you let him drink last night?

422
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,390
实话说  没多少
Honestly, not that much.

423
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,770
我们去湖滨之前得收拾好这些东西
Well, we gotta clean this up before we go to the lake.

424
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,020
什么  去湖滨?
What? The lake?

425
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:45,280
对  去湖滨  这可是你的主意
Yeah, the lake, dude. It was your idea.

426
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,990
昨晚我们一直在商量这事
We discussed all this last night.

427
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,360
没错没错  是去湖边
Oh, the lake! Yes, of course, the...

428
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,740
吉姆  能把纸巾拿给我吗
Hey, Jim, can you hand me those paper towels, please?

429
00:22:55,870 --> 00:22:58,450
-那些纸巾吗  -没错
- Oh, those paper towels? - The paper ones.

430
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,380
快拿纸巾来  吉姆
The paper towels, Jim.

431
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,460
-吉姆  -好的好的
- Jim! - Yeah...

432
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,010
快去拿纸巾
The paper towels!

433
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,470
十分抱歉
I'm really sorry.

434
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,520
吉姆  你应该知道那个锅盖是透明的吧
Jim, you do realize that the lid is see-through, right?

435
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,570
好眼力
Good eye.

436
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:33,160
这就是孩子他爹
That's the father of my child.

437
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,130
干什么呢
Oh, come on!

438
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,720
-注意点  -算了  就这样吧
- Hey, watch it! - Okay, jeez.

439
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,780
是我的错觉
Am I wrong, or was this

440
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,430
还是这里没我们年轻时那么有趣了
place a lot more fun when we were younger?

441
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,770
不  我觉得没变  只是我们老了而已
No, no. I think it's the same. We're just old now.

442
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:03,140
但是我们那时候也像这些小孩一样烦人吗
But were we just as obnoxious as these kids back in the day?

443
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:04,480
绝对不是
No.

444
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,320
我们这一代人比较成熟
Us, our generation, we were more mature.

445
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,150
伙计们  看我的
Hey, guys, check it out.

446
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,650
猎鲍鲨
Vagina shark!

447
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,570
他乱摸我
He touched my snatch!

448
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,830
我收回刚才的话
I take that back.

449
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:29,250
天啊
Oh, my God.

450
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:31,170
哥们  你们非得这么盯着不可吗
Fellas, do you gotta stare?

451
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,340
-没错  -当然了
- Yeah. - Yeah.

452
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:34,090
我们当然得一直盯着
Yes, we do need to stare.

453
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:39,140
吉姆还敢再明目张胆一点吗
Could Jim be any more obvious?

454
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,720
让他放松一下吧
Oh, give him a break.

455
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,440
我是说  你不是每天
I mean, it's not every day you

456
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,480
都能看见活生生的模特的
get to see a model walking around off the page.

457
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:49,980
最近在莱文斯汀家
There hasn't been a whole lot of sexy time

458
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:52,110
性生活可不大和谐
in the Levenstein household lately.

459
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,190
怎么回事
Why not?

460
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:56,990
不知道  我现在当妈妈了
I don't know. I'm a mom now.

461
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,370
拜托
Oh, please!

462
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,450
你当妈妈可不意味着
Just because you're a mom doesn't mean

463
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:04,080
你的那一面就被抹杀了
there isn't a whole other side to you.

464
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,960
还记得有次在乐队营那会
Hey, remember that one time at band camp

465
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,500
我们互相舔对方身上的奶油...
when we licked whipped cream off each other's...

466
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:13,800
是是是  我记得
Yes! Yes! I remember.

467
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,050
但是过去的事就让它过去  行不行
Let's keep that in the past, though, okay?

468
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,680
她居然...
Oh, she's...

469
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,170
没错  你确实该这么做
Yeah, well, you gotta do that

470
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,430
要不然身上就要被晒出斑马纹了
or else you're gonna get tan lines.

471
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,060
侧胸  在那  抱歉  奥兹  快看
Sideboob. There... Sorry. Sideboob. Ozzy, look!

472
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,600
好了  少出洋相了
Okay! Come on!

473
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:30,480
你可真走运  奥兹
You're a lucky man, Oz.

474
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,900
得了吧几位  我觉得我们都非常的
Oh, come on, guys. I think we're all pretty

475
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,780
幸运
lucky.

476
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,290
等等  那是海瑟吗
Wait, is that Heather?

477
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:47,120
就是她
Yeah, it is.

478
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:51,630
海瑟
Heather.

479
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,750
克里斯
Chris!

480
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,470
你来这干什么
What are you doing here?

481
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,390
可能是我们想到一块了
I guess we had the same idea, huh?

482
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,100
克里斯  这是朗  我的男朋友
Chris, this is Ron, my boyfriend.

483
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,210
克里斯?奥斯莱克  我是朗?道格拉斯
Chris Ostreicher, Ron Douglas.

484
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:05,560
很荣幸认识你
It's a pleasure to meet you.

485
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:06,730
你好
How do you do?

486
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,810
朗是我们医院的心脏病医师
Ron's a cardiologist at my hospital.

487
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,310
心脏病医师  真酷
A cardiologist. Wow.

488
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,740
没错  不过听着
Yeah. And, hey, listen, my

489
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,030
我朋友都叫我朗医生  朗生或者德朗
friends call me Doctor Ron, D-Ron or just Dron.

490
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,070
所以你怎么叫我都行
So you feel free.

491
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:17,700
好的
Okay.

492
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:18,950
你好  大便脸
Hey, fuckface!

493
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,160
唱诗班的妞  你也来了
Choir chick! Whoa!

494
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,580
很高兴见到你  硬条
Nice to see you, too, Stifler.

495
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,790
这傻冒是谁
Who's this douche?

496
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,160
我是她的男朋友
I'm her boyfriend.

497
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,630
也就是说  你们俩现在操得欢
So, you two are banging,

498
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,250
而你们俩从前一起操
and you two used to bang.

499
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,260
对你们所有人都挺难堪的吧
This must be awkward for all of you.

500
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,090
你来了以后确实如此了
It is now.

501
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,640
那个小杂种把我的胸罩抢走了
That little shit took my top!

502
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,140
还回来
Give it back!

503
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:47,140
那是我的女朋友
That's my girlfriend.

504
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,600
这是什么  这又是什么
What's this? What's this?

505
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:54,770
臭小子  你以为你在干什么
Hey, kid! What do you think you're doing?

506
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,530
快快快  快走
Hey! Come on, come on, let's go!

507
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:59,820
够了  伙计们  这可不好
Come on, guys. Not cool!

508
00:27:00,450 --> 00:27:02,950
你们这帮蠢货又能怎么样
What're you assholes gonna do about it?

509
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,130
这下有趣了
Well, that was interesting.

510
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:15,670
我们是不是应该做点什么
Well, should we do something?

511
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,130
有什么好做的呢  拜托
What are we gonna do? Come on.

512
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,380
同意  没必要自贬身份跟他们较劲
Agreed. There's no need to stoop to their level.

513
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:21,970
混账东西
Fuck that!

514
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,050
我知道他们去哪
I know exactly where they're going.

515
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,350
硬条?
Stifler?

516
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,410
他窜哪去了
Where the hell is he?

517
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,910
伙计们  这太蠢了
Guys, this is stupid.

518
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,600
我真的不能让米雪一等再等
I really can't keep Michelle waiting.

519
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,210
我们能掉头回去吗
Can we just head back?

520
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:54,250
等会  等硬条忙完
Hold on. Let Stifler do his thing.

521
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,500
我就担心这一茬
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

522
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,720
你们看到那帮家伙的表情了吗
Did you guys see the look on their faces?

523
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:06,930
太他妈帅了
Fucking awesome.

524
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,560
他疯了
He is crazy.

525
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,850
我觉得那里有一个人原来是凯菈的保姆
I think one of those guys was Kara's babysitter.

526
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,020
哪一个
Which one?

527
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,400
长得像亚当?桑德勒的那个
You know, the one that looked like Adam Sandier.

528
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,120
硬条最好别干什么出格的事
Stifler better not do anything crazy.

529
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,910
他就是想吼那些臭小子们几句
All he's gonna do is tell them off.

530
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,870
他不是要把他们的摩托艇放跑吗
I thought he was gonna cut their jet skis free.

531
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,580
那往他们的防晒霜里撒尿的事呢
What happened to pissing in their suntan lotion?

532
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:34,210
等下  他告诉我的是去偷他们的啤酒
Hold on. He told me he was going to steal their beer.

533
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,460
硬条
Stifler.

534
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,350
瞧  他来了
Oh, wait. There he is.

535
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:51,560
很好
All right.

536
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,930
没错  他在拿他们的啤酒
Yep, he's taking their beer.

537
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:56,270
快点  硬条  速战速决
All right, hurry up, Stifler. Come on.

538
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,480
他在干什么
What is he doing?

539
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,070
-不不不  完蛋了  -等等
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Wait.

540
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:02,780
-天啊  -我的天
- Oh, God! - Oh, my God.

541
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,070
斯蒂文  别这样
Steven! No!

542
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,150
天啊
Oh, God.

543
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,320
你真的确定凯菈今晚让你开苞吗
Yo, so you really think Kara's gonna give it up tonight?

544
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:09,410
她就等着十八岁这一天  你扳指头数数
She was waiting until she turns 18. You do the math.

545
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,040
我的指头也就能数出来的
The only math I know is

546
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:15,250
就是你跟她一次都没睡过
you've added your penis to her vagina zero times.

547
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,510
詹妮弗可不是烂货
Jennifer's not a skank.

548
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,590
老兄  她确实是
Dude, yes, she is.

549
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:24,760
我得吐一会
I'm gonna throw up.

550
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,260
天啊  太恶心了
Oh, my God. That's disgusting.

551
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,470
你在干什么
What're you doing?

552
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,420
爷在拉屎
I'm taking a shit!

553
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,350
快点  赶紧的
Hurry up. Come on!

554
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,600
来一口干  干了  干了
Down it, man! Just chug it! Chug it!

555
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,690
干掉它  别翻过去了
Do it. Do it! Don't puss out.

556
00:29:36,850 --> 00:29:38,350
别翻倒了
Don't puss out!

557
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:39,440
撤退  快撤退
Let's just go. Let's go.

558
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,520
快快快快
Go, go. Go, go, go, go. Go, go.

559
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:43,690
再来一瓶吗
You want another?

560
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:44,860
必须的
For sure.

561
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,240
哥们  我告诉你们
Guys, I'm telling you

562
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,620
她今晚就要实现一年前的诺言了
tonight is gonna be the night she promised me a year ago.

563
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,790
这他妈...
What the...

564
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,210
傻逼
Hey! Dipshit!

565
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,720
不要
No!

566
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,220
不要  不要
No, no!

567
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,560
硬条  你脑子烧坏了吗
Stifler! Are you crazy?

568
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:23,150
天啊  硬条  不是说好只偷他们的啤酒吗
Jesus, Stifler, what happened to just stealing their beer?

569
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,230
我知道  但这样更绝  不是吗
I know, this is so much better, right?

570
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,190
什么
What?

571
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,240
你把他们的摩托艇都毁了
You destroyed their jet skis.

572
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,410
谁让他们溅我们一身水
They splashed us.

573
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,410
所以呢...
So...

574
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,670
拜托  伙计们  这么干多有意思
Come on, guys. That was pretty funny.

575
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:43,670
也许高中时代挺有趣的  现在这可是重罪
Maybe in high school it was funny. Now it's just a felony.

576
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,000
除非我们被抓了
Only if we get caught.

577
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,970
没错  你确实得承认
Yeah, you gotta admit

578
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,840
给那些臭小子们点教训也不错
it was nice giving those kids a little payback.

579
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,010
让他们懂得尊敬前辈对他们有好处
Maybe it was good that they will learn to respect their elders.

580
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,390
太对了
Exactly!

581
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,220
等我一会  我要去找点卫生纸
Hey, give me a second, I gotta find some toilet paper.

582
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,600
真恶心
That's gross.

583
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,980
都还好吗  99级同学们
What's up, Class of '99-ers?

584
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:00,100
天啊  碧琪
Oh, my God! Vicky!

585
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:03,610
难以置信你也来了
I can't believe you're here.

586
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,270
我昨晚从纽约飞过来的
Yeah, I flew in from New York last night.

587
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,900
我本来在陪父母出游
I've been hanging out with my parents.

588
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,110
之前他们还说起你了
They were actually just talking about you earlier.

589
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,820
真的吗  都说什么了
Really? About what?

590
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,450
说他们发现我们在瀑布旁边亲热那会
That time they caught us making out at the Falls.

591
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,030
没错
Oh, right.

592
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,080
瀑布那啊  感觉都是上辈子的事了
The Falls. Wow, I haven't been there in forever.

593
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:20,290
米雪原来也喜欢去瀑布
Michelle used to love going to the Falls.

594
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,790
那地方简直是浪漫的化身
The place is romance incarnate.

595
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,130
太对了  我第一次舔肛就是在瀑布旁
Hell, yeah. I got my first rim job at the Falls.

596
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,420
好吧
Okay.

597
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,300
亲爱的
Hey, sweetie.

598
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,380
亲爱的
Mmm, sweetie pie!

599
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,680
一天没见了
Hello.

600
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:36,560
那些人都想去瀑布玩
So, the guys were all talking about heading over to the Falls.

601
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,770
那我们的二人时间怎么办
Well, what about Jim and Michelle time?

602
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:42,140
我就是觉得那边比较浪漫
I was thinking it could be kind of romantic.

603
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,860
我也想去  但是你爸爸陪小伊一整天了
Well, I'd love to, but your dad has been with Ev all day.

604
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,690
你说的没错
Yeah, no, you're right.

605
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,860
好吧  我们回家好了
Okay. Yeah, we'll just, we'll go home.

606
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:53,070
不用  你去玩吧
Oh, no, no. You go and have fun.

607
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,240
-真的吗  -当然了
- Really? - Yeah.

608
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,910
只是你回家的时候一定要做好准备
Just, when you get home, you just better be ready.

609
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,620
应该是你一定要做好准备
You better be ready.

610
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,330
我早就准备好了
I'm ready.

611
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:10,630
硬条  你还找得到北吗
Um, Stifler, do you know where you're going?

612
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,260
我对这里了如指掌
I know this place like the back of my cock.

613
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,230
像是个高中生派对
It looks like a high school party.

614
00:32:28,150 --> 00:32:29,530
全是高中妞
With high school chicks.

615
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:32,820
场面真火爆
It's on.

616
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,220
小心点  硬条
Watch it, Stifler.

617
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,530
这些姑娘年龄差不多只有你一半大
You know these girls are, like, half your age.

618
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,780
我知道
I know.

619
00:32:41,910 --> 00:32:46,540
是我的错觉  还是现在的姑娘比从前淫荡了
Okay, is it just me, or do girls today seem a bit sluttier?

620
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,750
你的感觉很准
Definitely.

621
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,880
青少年性行为  彩虹派对  互发裸照
Teen sex, rainbow parties, sexting nude photos...

622
00:32:51,050 --> 00:32:53,420
Kathie Lee & Hoda上这些东西应有尽有
I saw it all on Kathie Lee & Hoda.

623
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,630
生日快乐
Happy birthday!

624
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,640
吉姆?
Jim?

625
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,770
-凯菈  -你来了
- Kara. - You came!

626
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,480
失陪
Sorry.

627
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,900
生日快乐
Happy birthday.

628
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,450
老天  这就是你小时候的保姆吗
Oh, my God, is this the babysitter?

629
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:19,070
听起来你好像把我塑造成超级英雄了
You make it sound like I'm a superhero.

630
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,950
比跑车还快  比面包车还要猛
Faster than a speeding stroller, more powerful than a mini-van.

631
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,540
我说过他很有趣
I told you he was funny.

632
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,830
真可爱
He's adorable.

633
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,090
吉姆  要不要给你的朋友引荐一下我
Hey, Jim. Do you wanna introduce me to your friends?

634
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,250
坚决不
No.

635
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:35,010
姑娘们  这是硬条
Girls, this is Stifler.

636
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,930
那么你们怎么认识我最好的朋友吉姆的
So, how do you know my best friend Jim?

637
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,800
吉姆在我小时候照顾过我
Jim used to be my babysitter.

638
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,680
我正好要来杯庆生酒
Hey, I was just gonna do a birthday shot.

639
00:33:43,770 --> 00:33:45,100
能陪我喝一杯吗
Do you guys wanna do one with me?

640
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,310
不不不  算了吧
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

641
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:47,390
当然可以  当然可以
Yeah. Oh, yes, yes, yes.

642
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,360
-我不该喝  -咱该喝  该喝
- I shouldn't. - Yes, we should, yes, we should.

643
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,820
我从没在公共场合做过爱
Never have I ever had sex in public.

644
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,990
真的吗  也就是说你们都没做过吗
Really? None of you?

645
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:03,790
拜托  海瑟  你一滴酒都没喝
Oh, come on, Heather. You haven't drunk once.

646
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,500
你也太正经了
You are such a prude!

647
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,420
或者是因为我没在公共场合做过爱
Or maybe I've just never had sex in public.

648
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:15,760
好吧  我从来没群交过
Okay, never have I ever been in an orgy.

649
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:23,260
其实那些人都很好
They were really nice guys.

650
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,140
信不信由你  这是我第一次参加高中生派对
Believe it or not, this is my first high school party.

651
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:28,770
你也没错过什么好东西
You didn't miss much.

652
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:33,480
我总喜欢待在家里听听广播
I always preferred staying at home, throwing on a little NPR.

653
00:34:33,650 --> 00:34:35,480
你比我酷多了
You were so much cooler than me.

654
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:39,570
我就是随便写写《X档案》同人小说
I sat around writing X-Files fan fiction.

655
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:47,330
我曾把《卡拉马佐夫兄弟》翻译成拉丁文玩
I translated The Brothers Karamazov into Latin for fun.

656
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,170
太性感了
That is so sexy.

657
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,670
还是你识货
You know it is.

658
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,500
近几年我就是干干建筑师
I've only been working as an architect

659
00:34:55,590 --> 00:34:58,010
而且是窝在家里工作
for the last few years, and from home.

660
00:34:58,170 --> 00:35:00,050
十年间你都没换过公司
You've been with the same company for over ten years.

661
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,470
真了不起  我觉得你的人生十分顺利
That's awesome, it sounds like everything is working out for you.

662
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:05,930
是的  我是说真的挺顺  尤其是工作方面
Yeah. I mean, everything's good, especially work-wise.

663
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,520
但是现在我们回这个镇里
But now that we're back here in the town

664
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,140
见了见老朋友
and we see, like, all of our old friends

665
00:35:09,310 --> 00:35:11,850
结果大家都结婚生子
and everyone's married and having kids

666
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:14,940
我就有了点想法
it just makes me, you know, think.

667
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,530
你还好吧  凯文
You okay there, Kev?

668
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,200
没事  我只是一般不这么喝酒
Yeah, I just don't normally drink like this.

669
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:24,410
你是说在迈尔斯家庭酒会的时候
You're telling me you haven't gotten a little bit tipsy

670
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,910
你一丁点都没醉吗
on Myers Family Wine Night?

671
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,120
看来有人在偷偷地关注我的脸书主页了
I see somebody's been stalking my Facebook page.

672
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,670
不过至少我从不拍我吃了什么
At least I don't take pictures of my meals.

673
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,290
现在是谁在偷偷关注谁了
Who's stalking who now?

674
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:36,800
好  我承认去过你的主页一两次
Okay, so I've been by your page maybe once or twice.

675
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,220
你跟一个叫亚历山卓的人约过会吗
You were dating someone named Alessandro?

676
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,990
他真的知道
You know, he does know that

677
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:44,050
他是可以穿着上衣照相的  是吗
he can take a picture with his shirt on, right?

678
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,310
亚历山卓早是陈年往事了
Alessandro is long gone.

679
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:50,980
早就结束了  对吧
It's over, huh?

680
00:35:55,230 --> 00:35:57,230
喝完这杯后我就得回家了
Okay, after this drink, I gotta go home.

681
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,360
吉姆
Jim.

682
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,150
这里有一个你原来照顾过的
There's a smoking hot 18-year-old

683
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,280
火辣得冒烟的十八岁的妞
girl over there that you used to babysit.

684
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:04,410
你就没什么想法吗
And you're not going to do anything about that?

685
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,660
需不需要我提醒你我已经结婚了
Need I remind you that I am married to Michelle?

686
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:07,740
这才是重点
Exactly.

687
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,280
这些年轻妞
Dude, these young chicks

688
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,620
床上功夫可是了得
they know some crazy shit in the bedroom.

689
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,000
你可以从凯菈那里取其精华
You could take what you learn from Kara,

690
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:19,760
然后学以致用到米雪身上
bring it home, and apply it to Michelle.

691
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,090
你很在意婚姻的  不是吗  吉姆
You do care about your marriage, don't you, Jim?

692
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,760
你在胡言乱语什么  硬条
What are you talking about, Stifler?

693
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,010
我可不背着妻子偷情
I'm not gonna cheat on my wife!

694
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,180
老天有眼  我可是个父亲
I'm a father for Christ's sakes.

695
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,350
这才是最完美的
Yeah, that's perfect.

696
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,140
慈父形象魅力无穷  继续打这张牌
Yeah, chicks love a father figure. Keep playing that card, dude.

697
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,480
这不是牌不牌的问题  你现实一点
It's not a card, it's the truth.

698
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,440
你们在聊什么呢
What are you guys talking about?

699
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,780
你知道的  就是
Oh, you know... Just...

700
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:45,360
吉姆只是在说照顾你十分开心
Jim was just saying how much fun he had taking care of you.

701
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,160
姑娘们  咱们让他们单独叙叙旧吧
Hey, ladies, why don't we give them some time to catch up?

702
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,410
好主意  你先请
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, after you.

703
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,790
不必不必  我们应该一起玩
No, that's not necessary. We should all hang out together.

704
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,540
我们为什么不一起  硬条...
Why don't we all... Stifler, just...

705
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:55,040
操死她
Be her daddy.

706
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,130
硬条  硬条
Stifler? Stifler!

707
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:05,130
听起来你和蜜儿都挺喜欢尝试新花样
So, sounds like you and Mia have quite an adventurous lifestyle.

708
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:07,720
有时候玩得也比较过火
Sometimes a little too adventurous.

709
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:12,390
海瑟就有点保守
Wow. Well, Heather's a bit more on the conservative side.

710
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,480
但是
But, uh...

711
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:18,160
但是  老实说  克里斯
But, I gotta be honest, Chris,

712
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,650
我自己愿意试试新花样
I could use a little adventure myself.

713
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,690
你想说什么  朗
What are you getting at, Ron?

714
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:27,570
我只是说我一般不玩换妻游戏
I'm just saying that usually I'm not one for swapping

715
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,830
但是想到你原来就和海瑟在一起
but the fact that you've been

716
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:33,000
似乎就没什么问题了
with Heather already, kind of makes it okay.

717
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,580
那么你怎么想
So, what do you think?

718
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
你觉得她们愿不愿意这么玩
Think they'd be into it?

719
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:42,710
我开玩笑的  好了  就是随便说说
I'm kidding. Come on, I'm kidding!

720
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,170
老实说  这事我坚决不干
Seriously, I would never do that!

721
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,930
除非你们愿意
Unless you guys wanted to.

722
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,850
你真的到过南美的每个国家吗
So you've really been to every country in South America?

723
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,930
没有全都去
No, no, not all of them.

724
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,190
而且我也不觉得法属圭亚那是个国家
And I don't consider French Guiana a nation.

725
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:03,190
我记得我那时都等不及要毕业
I remember, I couldn't wait till graduation

726
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:06,280
那样我就能离开这里脱胎换骨
so I could leave this town and reinvent myself.

727
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:09,160
你的变化真的不小
You have certainly reinvented yourself.

728
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,320
我也不知道
I don't know.

729
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,620
我灵魂中还是有个微弱的声音
There's just a part of me that still wishes that

730
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,120
希望能探索全世界
I could just explore the world, you know?

731
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:17,120
能心想事成
Be everything I set out to be.

732
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:21,290
你可以心想事成  只要动手去干
You can be whoever you wanna be. You just gotta be it.

733
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,300
-想亲热一下吗  -想
- You wanna make out? - Yeah.

734
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:32,970
你开玩笑吗  我爱死暮光系列了
Are you crazy? I love the Twilight books.

735
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,890
《新月》是我的最爱
New Moon is my favorite.

736
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,060
我也是
Mine, too!

737
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,770
老天  我们真是志同道合
Oh, my God! We have, like, so much in common!

738
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,150
我知道
I know!

739
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,570
想抽一口吗
Wanna hit this?

740
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,400
做梦都想
In more ways than one.

741
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,710
我不知道你是谁
I don't know who this is,

742
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,450
但是我他妈现在真的很忙
but I'm pretty fucking busy right now.

743
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,830
那就抱歉打扰了  殃条
So sorry to interrupt, Stafler.

744
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,120
没想到残奥会晚上还有比赛
Didn't realize the Special Olympics competed at night.

745
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,290
该死
Oh, fuck.

746
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,340
你那边到底怎么回事
What the hell's going on over there?

747
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,840
吃屎噎着了吗
What, are you choking on your own dick?

748
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,840
没事  度莱斯瓦米先生  没事
Nothing, Mr. Duraiswamy, nothing.

749
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,680
有什么需要效劳吗  先生
What can I do for you, sir?

750
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,680
财务处的鲍勃突发心脏病
Bob from Acquisitions had a heart attack.

751
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,520
不知道是哪个混球告诉他被炒了
Some idiot told him that he was fired.

752
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,890
他一下就崩溃了  我也不知道怎么回事
He flipped out, I don't know.

753
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,390
听着  我需要找人完成他的提案
Listen, I need someone to finish his presentation.

754
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,310
我要你周日到公司完成工作  明白吗
I need you to go in on Sunday and get everything ready. Yes?

755
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,770
等等  周日
Oh, wait, Sunday.

756
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:27,860
我还要参加高中同学聚会呢
I got my high school reunion.

757
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,150
多好玩啊
Oh, wow, how fun!

758
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,650
那行  我给董事长打个电话
Yeah, no, I'll just call the chairman

759
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,820
让他把时间重新安排一下就行了
and I'll get him to reschedule.

760
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,240
真的吗  那太好了
Seriously? Hey, that would be awesome!

761
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,110
我他妈当然是说着玩的  蠢货
That was a fucking joke, you moron.

762
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:37,790
老天啊  我在做什么
Jesus Christ, what am I doing?

763
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:40,620
算了  我自己搞定吧
You know what, I am gonna handle this myself.

764
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,580
不不不  听着  度莱斯瓦米先生
No. No, no, no, listen, Mr. Duraiswamy

765
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:46,460
我能解决  保证完成任务
I can do it, okay? I promise, I'll get it done.

766
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,170
别再闹什么岔子  殃条
Just don't fuck up, Stafler.

767
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,800
我的名字叫硬条
It's Stifler.

768
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,930
二傻  姑娘们...
Dick! Hey, ladies...

769
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:55,470
-姑娘们呢  -她们早散了
- Ladies? - They bailed, dude.

770
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,350
我靠
Aw, fuck!

771
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,810
凯菈  你今晚怎么回家
Hey, Kara, how are you getting home tonight?

772
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,650
AJ本来是要开车带我回家
AJ was supposed to drive my car back

773
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,150
但他现在都没影
but he hasn't even shown up yet.

774
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,650
拿摩托艇坏了这种破借口搪塞我
Some lame excuse about his jet skis.

775
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,490
你能相信这混球吗
Can you believe that jerk?

776
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:18,160
你呢
What about you?

777
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:19,490
你能带我回去吗
Will you take me?

778
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,500
拜托  我们顺路
Come on! We're going to the same place.

779
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:27,590
而且  如果你让我醉驾回家
Besides, it wouldn't be responsible

780
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:30,010
那就太不负责任了
to let me drive in this condition.

781
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,420
对吧
Right?

782
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,060
好吧  凯菈
Okay, Kara.

783
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,060
注意  注意安全
Hey! Whoa! Careful! Careful. Yeah.

784
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,900
我爱死这歌了
Oh, my God, I love this song.

785
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,110
确实不错
It's a good one.

786
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:48,730
难道经典摇滚不是最棒的吗
Isn't classic rock the best?

787
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,190
经典摇滚  这是经典摇滚吗
Classic rock? This is classic rock now?

788
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,240
凯菈  你该多喝点水
Hey, you know, Kara, you should drink some more water.

789
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,870
我给你的瓶子呢
Where's that bottle I gave you?

790
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,950
-在这呢  -行
- Oh, it's right here. - Okay.

791
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:02,200
在后座
In the back.

792
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:11,210
该死  抱歉  刚才有个...
Shit. Sorry. Sorry. There was a...

793
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:15,300
刚才路上有只小松鼠
There was a little baby squirrel in the road, so...

794
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:19,930
那可不是水  好了
Whoa! Hey! Whoa! That's not water. Okay.

795
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:23,430
你喝得可真不少
It's a little too much now.

796
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,590
这么多年过去了
I love how, after all these years,

797
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:27,400
你还这么照顾我  我就喜欢你这点
you're still taking care of me.

798
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,520
照顾你的工作可没尽头
Well, you know, a babysitter's job never ends.

799
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:33,820
你知道我一直很喜欢你  是吧
You knew I always had a crush on you, right?

800
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,070
不知道
No.

801
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,370
我想把初夜给你
I want you to be my first.

802
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:44,080
你的初夜?
Your first?

803
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:46,250
天啊  好吧
Oh, God. Okay. Um...

804
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,460
凯菈  听着
Kara, listen. Um...

805
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:53,960
一个人的贞操是十分圣洁的  你知道吗
A person's virginity is something sacred, you know?

806
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,630
你应该留给一个对你有特殊意义的人
You should save yourself for someone special.

807
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,760
你就对我有特殊意义
You're special.

808
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:00,300
不  我才算不上特殊呢
No! Not special.

809
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:02,600
你真这么想  我真的...
You think? I really...

810
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:04,600
你在干什么
What are you doing?

811
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,850
你在干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

812
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,520
来吧  没人会知道的
Come on. No one will ever find out.

813
00:42:10,690 --> 00:42:13,400
我不知道  我可不认为...
I don't know. I don't think...

814
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:15,820
我不能这么做
I don't think I should do that.

815
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,570
这太  我不能  我不会
That's... No. I can't. I won't. I won't.

816
00:42:19,070 --> 00:42:20,070
你知道的  这太
So, you know... That's...

817
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,370
你在干嘛  好吧好吧
Whoa! Hello! Okay, okay.

818
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:23,790
凯菈  凯菈  你不能亲我
Kara, Kara, that's kissing.

819
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:25,830
凯菈  快停下
Okay, Kara, you need to stop. Stop. Stop!

820
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:29,620
你觉得我不漂亮吗
You don't think I'm pretty?

821
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:34,550
没有  你很漂亮凯菈  很漂亮
Oh, no! You're very pretty, Kara. You're very, very...

822
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,380
-真的吗  -真的  很漂亮
- Really? - Yes, very pretty.

823
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,880
-但是我  你很漂亮  -谢谢
- But I... Very pretty. - Thanks.

824
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,470
我的老天
Oh, my God!

825
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,890
该死的  你在干什么
Holy shit! What?

826
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,220
老天  你的衣服呢
Oh, my... Where did your...

827
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:46,310
来吧
Come on.

828
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,810
我想不到比这更好的生日礼物了
I can't think of a better birthday gift.

829
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,520
我送你一个新苹果手机好不好
What about the new iPhone?

830
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:52,560
或者小吊坠  还是妮基米娜的新专辑
Huh? Maybe a little pendant? The new Nicki Minaj album?

831
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,730
不好吗  你的胸
No. No? Boobies.

832
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,150
我想要你
I want you!

833
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,490
你不可以  别这样
You can't... Don't do that.

834
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:59,070
这不好  真的
That's not good, don't...

835
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,660
快停下
Come on, stop.

836
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,700
凯菈  凯菈  停下
Kara! Kara! Stop it.

837
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:04,450
见鬼
Shit!

838
00:43:08,830 --> 00:43:10,000
见鬼  凯菈
Shit. Kara?

839
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,170
我的老天  凯菈
Holy Jesus! Kara?

840
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,710
凯菈  快醒醒
Kara! Kara! Please wake up, Kara!

841
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,550
快醒醒  凯菈
Kara, wake up. Kara!

842
00:43:16,710 --> 00:43:17,710
你还好吗
Are you okay?

843
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,920
我的天
Oh, Jesus, God!

844
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:20,430
我的天  你还好吗
Oh, my God, are you all right?

845
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,850
吉姆
Jim?

846
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:28,560
天啊  太疯狂了
What? This is crazy!

847
00:43:28,770 --> 00:43:30,140
你还好吗
Are you all right?

848
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:33,690
我没事  我没事  我只是
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm okay. I was just...

849
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:36,230
我刚刚想找什么东西来着
I was reaching for something.

850
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,570
我没事  我很好
Everything's okay. Everything's fine.

851
00:43:39,110 --> 00:43:40,450
我不知道你听说了没
I don't know if you've heard.

852
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,530
你听说了吗
Did you hear?

853
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,780
是我负责这次重聚
I am in charge of the reunion.

854
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:47,740
噢  没有  这太好了
Oh! Yeah, no, that's... Yeah, that's right.

855
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:49,370
我想到了一个九十年代主题的计划
Got a whole '90s theme planned.

856
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,290
这还真是
Oh. That's...

857
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:53,250
我本来请了春巴旺巴乐队
I booked Chumbawamba.

858
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:55,380
但是那帮混球昨天又取消了
Yeah. But the pricks cancelled yesterday.

859
00:43:55,590 --> 00:43:58,380
我很受打击  但是你了解我的
Was a setback, but you know me,

860
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,970
在哪里倒下我就从哪里爬起来
"I get knocked down but I get up again."

861
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:07,140
天啊  我明白是咋回事了
Oh, my God! Okay, I see what's going on.

862
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,690
-是米雪吗  -是啊
- Michelle? - Yeah.

863
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,280
正点
Nice.

864
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,810
是啊
Yep.

865
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,020
待会见  伙计
I'll see you later, buddy.

866
00:44:16,190 --> 00:44:17,860
好的  待会见
All right then, I'll see you.

867
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,860
老天  凯菈  快醒醒
Jesus, God. Kara. Kara, wake up.

868
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,030
-我想睡一会  -什么
- I just need a nap. - What?

869
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,280
凯菈  现在不是睡觉的时候  快起来
Kara, this isn't time for a nap. Kara, wake up.

870
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:28,740
不是睡觉的时候
This isn't napping time.

871
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,540
凯菈  该死
Kara? Shit.

872
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:40,460
老天  大事不妙了
Oh, God, this is bad. This is very, very bad.

873
00:44:51,930 --> 00:44:53,270
你们怎么这么久才来
What took you guys so long?

874
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,480
我们去找凯文了  他不见了
We were looking for Kevin. Couldn't find him.

875
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:56,960
而且奥兹那臭小子喝酒喝得不省人事
Plus, that hot piece of ass Oz

876
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,110
所以我们不得不把那小子送回家
is banging got wasted, so we had to drop her off.

877
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,280
你们竟然带他来
You brought him?

878
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,530
他们当然得带上我
Of course they brought me.

879
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,190
你们还在高中忙着打飞机的时候
When you guys were busy jacking off in high school,

880
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,240
我每周末就在练这个
I was running this drill every weekend.

881
00:45:05,410 --> 00:45:07,320
让我看看是怎么回事
Now, let's see what we are dealing with.

882
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,250
我的天啊
Holy shit!

883
00:45:13,410 --> 00:45:14,370
行啊你  吉姆
Way to go, Jim.

884
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,630
啥事都没有  硬条  啥事都没有
Okay, nothing happened, Stifler. Okay? Nothing happened.

885
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:18,790
别碰她
Stop that!

886
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,050
对不起
I'm sorry.

887
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:21,550
吉姆  你想怎么办
So, Jim, what do you wanna do?

888
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:22,880
我不知道
I don't know.

889
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,760
但是我不能把她扔在这
I can't just leave her here naked, you know?

890
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,590
如果警察来了发现这事跟我有关
I mean, if the cops come by and find out I'm involved,

891
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:29,600
我就完蛋了
I'm screwed.

892
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,640
我们有两个选择
That leaves us with two options.

893
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,270
扔下她或者偷偷送回去
We dump the body or we sneak her inside.

894
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,440
扔下她  我们又不是土匪
Dump the body? This isn't a mob hit.

895
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,810
等一下
Okay, wait a second.

896
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,320
我以前去过她家无数次
I have been in her house a million times to babysit.

897
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,530
我能偷偷地把她从后门送进去
I can totally sneak her in through the back door.

898
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:47,280
你们得去转移她父母的注意力
I need you guys to distract her parents.

899
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,160
你认为你能搞定吗
Do you think you can do that?

900
00:45:49,530 --> 00:45:53,620
我是专家  吉姆  相信我  交给我吧
I'm an expert, Jim. Trust me. I got this shit.

901
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:02,670
晚上好先生
Good evening, sir.

902
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:04,670
我朋友的车抛锚了
My friend's car broke down,

903
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:06,220
我们在想
and we were just wondering

904
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,300
我们能不能借你的电话叫一下救援
if we could use your phone to call AAA.

905
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:12,510
你是说你们都没有手机吗
You mean to tell me that none of you have cell phones?

906
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,530
老天  我认得你  你参加过"热舞明星"
Oh, my God, I know you. You were on Celebrity Dance Off.

907
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,610
是的
Oh, yeah!

908
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:26,820
奥斯莱克
Ostreicher.

909
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,200
是啊
Oh, yeah.

910
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:29,490
进来吧
Hey, come on in.

911
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,910
你还真是厉害啊  硬条
That was very smooth, Stifler.

912
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,330
闭嘴  蠢货
Shut up, shitbreak.

913
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,660
我上次干这种事的时候手机都还没发明呢
The last time I did this, cell phones didn't exist.

914
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:53,350
该死
Shit!

915
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,560
爸爸
Daddy.

916
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:03,270
妈妈快看  是爸爸
Look, Mom, Daddy!

917
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
该死
Shit!

918
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:20,750
见鬼
Oh, fuck!

919
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:25,590
凯菈
Kara?

920
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:28,590
凯菈
Kara?

921
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,970
来追我啊
Gonna have to find me.

922
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,220
凯菈
Kara?

923
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:35,390
谢谢  珊兰达  你帮了我大忙
Thank you, Sheranda. You've been very helpful.

924
00:47:35,470 --> 00:47:37,890
我对你服务的评价是3A
You get a Triple A-plus in my book.

925
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,100
你也保重  拜拜
Oh, you take care, too. Okay, yeah, bye-bye.

926
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:46,480
电话打通了  救援马上就到
So, that was AAA on the phone and they should be here in a jiffy.

927
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,110
还记得这首歌吗
Does this song sound familiar?

928
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:55,560
你跳得很好
You were such a good dancer.

929
00:47:55,560 --> 00:47:57,080
你被淘汰的时候我很遗憾
I felt so bad when you got voted off.

930
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:58,330
谢谢
Thank you.

931
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:00,500
但我还是得说你真人比电视上性感多了
But I have to say you're much sexier in person.

932
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:04,670
好了  行了  苏珊
Okay. Calm down there, Susan.

933
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:08,090
伙计  她想跟你大干一场
Dude, she wants to fuck you big time, dude.

934
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,420
-你得招架住哦  -没门
- You got to hit that. - No fucking way.

935
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,840
这是为了吉姆  别那么自私
Do it for Jim, dude, don't be selfish.

936
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:15,140
你知道吧  我想我要去下洗手间
Hey, you know what? I think I have to go to the bathroom.

937
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,100
凯菈  这不好玩
Kara, this is not funny.

938
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:20,980
凯菈  快出来
Kara, come on! Kara, come out.

939
00:48:22,520 --> 00:48:23,810
天哪
Oh, my God!

940
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,610
好吧  快来
Okay, hey, come on.

941
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,280
好吧  好吧
Okay, one... Okay, all right...

942
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,240
快来  好的
Come on. Okay, good.

943
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,070
你找不到我
You never could find me.

944
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:35,990
吉姆  我不想吓你  但是时间不多了
Jim, I don't mean to alarm you but you don't have much time.

945
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,160
是的  我知道
Yes, I know.

946
00:48:37,330 --> 00:48:38,620
-我喜欢你的围巾  -好吧
- I like your scarf. - Okay.

947
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:40,500
-我喜欢你的大胸  -门
- I like your breasts. - Door.

948
00:48:40,660 --> 00:48:42,080
可以拍个照吗
Would it be okay if I get a picture?

949
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,250
当然
Sure.

950
00:48:47,750 --> 00:48:49,340
我就放在这的
I know it's in here somewhere.

951
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:55,430
好吧 一瓶发胶
Okay, a bottle of hair spray...

952
00:48:55,510 --> 00:48:56,590
你们还好吧
You guys all right?

953
00:48:56,680 --> 00:48:58,010
没事
Yeah. Yeah.

954
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,850
你知道吗
You know something?

955
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:04,810
我真佩服你的洗手间里的马桶能那么干净
I really was admiring how clean your toilet was in your bathroom.

956
00:49:05,350 --> 00:49:06,480
谢谢
Thanks.

957
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:09,360
你知道吗  我也要用下洗手间
You know what? I have to use the restroom, too.

958
00:49:09,530 --> 00:49:10,610
你不行
No, you don't.

959
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:19,330
躺床上去
Let's get in bed.

960
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:20,540
你不跟我一起吗
Come on and get in bed with me?

961
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:21,740
不  我不要
No, I'm not getting in bed...

962
00:49:21,830 --> 00:49:22,870
来吧  跟我一起
Come on. Get in bed with me.

963
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,500
不  我不能  凯菈  我的天啊
No, I'm not... Kara, please. Oh, God. Please.

964
00:49:25,580 --> 00:49:26,580
该死
Oh, shit!

965
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,960
硬条  你在这干嘛
Stifler, what are you doing here?

966
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:30,960
-我只是想来看一眼  -不行
- I just wanted another glimpse. - No.

967
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,550
你怎么给她穿上衣服了伙计
Why'd you put her clothes back on, dude? Boo.

968
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:33,840
你快走
You have to go.

969
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:36,720
那是什么
What was that?

970
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:39,050
像是从外面传来的
That sounded like it came from outside.

971
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:41,060
从凯菈房间传来的
No, that came from Kara's room.

972
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:42,310
天哪
Oh, Jesus.

973
00:49:42,390 --> 00:49:43,390
凯菈
Kara?

974
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,440
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

975
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,400
快走  快走
Go, go, go!

976
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,070
到底发生了什么
What the hell's going on in here?

977
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,330
爸爸
Hi, Daddy.

978
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,120
你怎么进来的
How'd you get back in?

979
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,370
我不记得了
I don't remember.

980
00:50:05,540 --> 00:50:07,000
你不记得
You don't remember?

981
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:08,920
是什么声音
What was that sound?

982
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:09,960
我不知道
I don't know.

983
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:11,130
你什么意思  你不知道
What do you mean, you don't know?

984
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:12,210
我不知道
I don't know.

985
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:15,550
你喝醉了  是吗
You've been drinking, haven't you?

986
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:16,840
没有
No.

987
00:50:17,010 --> 00:50:19,800
凯菈  我告诉过你那些男生想把你灌醉
Kara, I told you these boys try to get you drunk

988
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,510
然后占你便宜
so they can take advantage of you.

989
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,180
我知道这些  爸爸
I'm old enough to know that, Dad.

990
00:50:23,350 --> 00:50:24,930
我可不想为了
Yeah, well, I don't want to go to jail

991
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:26,930
揍那些臭小子而进监狱
for kicking some horny kid's teeth in

992
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:28,770
但是我会的  相信我
but I will, believe me.

993
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,570
你是什么
What is that?

994
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:37,030
那是小牛先生
Oh, that's Mr. Moo!

995
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,570
你能把它递给我吗  爸爸
Will you get him for me, Daddy? Please.

996
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,930
我不会生我宝贝气的
I can't be mad at my angel.

997
00:51:05,930 --> 00:51:08,100
生日快乐  我的小公主
Happy birthday, princess.

998
00:51:08,310 --> 00:51:09,390
谢谢爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

999
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:19,990
你在干什么
What are you doing?

1000
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:22,120
没干什么
Nothing.

1001
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,990
天啊
Oh, jeez.

1002
00:51:29,250 --> 00:51:30,290
硬条
Stifler?

1003
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:32,540
硬条
Stifler?

1004
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:33,670
在这儿  伙计
Up here, dude.

1005
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:36,460
我跟你说过我是专家
I told you I was an expert.

1006
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,840
该死
Oh, shit.

1007
00:51:39,510 --> 00:51:41,130
又发生了什么
What the hell is going on now?

1008
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:47,180
想去看贾斯丁·比伯的演唱会吗
Want to go to a Justin Bieber concert?

1009
00:51:47,270 --> 00:51:48,680
吉姆
Uh... Jim?

1010
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,350
硬条  快点
Stifler, come on. Come on!

1011
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:51,810
我们走
Let's go.

1012
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,690
你们俩待在这
You and you, stay here.

1013
00:51:56,190 --> 00:51:57,400
别推我
Don't push me.

1014
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:00,150
我的天啊
Whoa! Oh, my God.

1015
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:05,620
凯菈  你在哪
Kara, where the hell are you?

1016
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,490
我在去你家路上
I'm on my way to your place and...

1017
00:52:10,830 --> 00:52:12,210
我了个
What the...

1018
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,330
该死
Fuck!

1019
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,460
到底怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

1020
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:23,010
天哪
Oh, God!

1021
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,520
猪头
Hey, stud.

1022
00:52:37,690 --> 00:52:39,530
我想你从来没有
I thought you'd never...

1023
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:04,800
该死  我们本来要
Oh, shit, shit. We were supposed to...

1024
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:05,970
没关系
No, it's fine.

1025
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:08,050
什么  不  老天  很不好
What? No, God, it's not fine.

1026
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:12,100
米雪  对不起  我真的  我只是想
Shoot! I'm so sorry, Michelle. I really... I wanted to, I just...

1027
00:53:12,270 --> 00:53:14,310
我要把小伊送到我奶奶家
I'm going to drop Ev at my grandma's

1028
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,400
我下午就回来
and I'll be back this afternoon.

1029
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,520
米雪  等一下
No, Michelle, hold on.

1030
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,860
吉姆  我有点担心
Jim, I'm worried.

1031
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:26,530
你担心什么
What are you worried about?

1032
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:30,530
我们走不到一块
Just we're like so out of sync.

1033
00:53:32,620 --> 00:53:34,250
我只是
I just...

1034
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:36,920
我不知道我们还能坚持多久
I don't know how much longer we can go on like this.

1035
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,630
我保证我会尽全力补偿你
I promise you I will do everything I can to make it up to you.

1036
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,260
好吗
Okay?

1037
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,050
硬条今晚要办一个派对
Stifler's having a party tonight.

1038
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:52,680
我知道这听起来不怎么浪漫
Okay, I know that doesn't sound romantic or anything,

1039
00:53:52,770 --> 00:53:54,880
但是想想我们的第一次
but remember our first time

1040
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,270
就是在硬条派对上发生的
was at a Stifler party.

1041
00:53:58,440 --> 00:53:59,980
你把我弄得那叫一个惨
You made me your bitch.

1042
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,990
是的  是的
Yes. Yes, I did.

1043
00:54:24,510 --> 00:54:26,010
要射的时候说一声  好吗
Tell me when, okay?

1044
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:27,590
这他妈怎么回事
What the fuck?

1045
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:57,460
蜜儿这个女孩子
So, Mia.

1046
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:01,500
她挺无拘无束的
She's a free spirit.

1047
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:03,170
不止这样
She's something else.

1048
00:55:03,340 --> 00:55:04,840
是的
Yeah, she is.

1049
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,680
等一下  你吃醋了吗
Wait a minute, do I sense a little jealousy there?

1050
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,340
-没有  -没有吗
- No. - No?

1051
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,760
别忘了  是你跟我分手的
Hey, don't forget, you were the one who broke up with me

1052
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:15,140
你去了医学院之后
before you went to med school.

1053
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:19,390
你去了洛杉矶后就一去不返
Hey, you were moving to LA with no return in sight.

1054
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,020
你不能怪我想要安定下来
You can't blame me for wanting to settle down.

1055
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,520
我没有
No, I don't.

1056
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,110
我只是不希望你已经定下来了
I just don't want you to settle.

1057
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,910
看看是谁在吃醋
Look who's jealous now.

1058
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:33,870
我不能说和朗定了
I wouldn't call being with Ron "Settling."

1059
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,540
他只是虚有其表
Oh, no, he's gorgeous on paper.

1060
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,330
这什么意思
What is that supposed to mean?

1061
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,410
没什么
Nothing.

1062
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:44,670
对不起  你是对的
I'm sorry. You're right.

1063
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,050
我的确是在嫉妒
I am a bit jealous.

1064
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:51,220
你知道  这很好笑
You know, it's funny.

1065
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,720
从某些方面来说  你完全变了一个人
In some ways, you've completely changed,

1066
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,850
某些方面你又完全没变
and, in other ways, you're exactly the same.

1067
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,060
海瑟  你可以相信这点
Heather, you can believe this,

1068
00:56:01,230 --> 00:56:02,730
什么都没有改变
nothing's changed.

1069
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:06,230
天哪
Oh, my God.

1070
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,030
克里斯?奥斯莱克
Chris Ostreicher?

1071
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:09,740
姑娘们
Hi, girls.

1072
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,950
能合个影吗
Can I get a pic?

1073
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,200
当然
Sure.

1074
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:18,910
爸爸
Dad?

1075
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:21,910
-爸爸  -吉姆
- Oh, hey, Dad. - Hey, Jim.

1076
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:23,710
我要出去一下
I'm just going to run out for a sec.

1077
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,710
我在看你的成人礼录像带
I was just watching your old Bar Mitzvah tape.

1078
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:30,130
我拿到你的犹太围巾了
I got your Jew scarf!

1079
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:31,920
还给我  硬条
Give it back, Stifler.

1080
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,140
托你的福我是世上最幸福的人
I think I'm the happiest man in the world thanks to you.

1081
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:47,650
我也很想她  爸爸
Yeah, I miss her too, Dad.

1082
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:50,820
我知道
I know.

1083
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:03,120
爸爸  你总是为我提供建议
Dad, you've always been there to give me advice.

1084
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:07,130
但是你如果想说什么
But if there's anything that you want to talk about,

1085
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:09,960
我都愿意听
I'm here for you.

1086
00:57:11,510 --> 00:57:13,970
我想我没有什么
Yeah, I don't think there's anything

1087
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,470
真的想说的  吉姆
I really need to talk about, Jim.

1088
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:20,470
你觉得现在是时候
Do you think maybe it's time for you to

1089
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:22,310
为你找个伴吗
meet someone else?

1090
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:25,520
爸爸  没事的
Dad, it's okay.

1091
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:29,820
你现在经历的过程都是非常正常的
What you're going through is perfectly natural.

1092
00:57:30,730 --> 00:57:33,530
你知道的  外面有那种服务
You know, there are services out there...

1093
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:34,740
-那种服务  -是啊
- Services? - Yeah.

1094
00:57:34,820 --> 00:57:36,030
什么服务
Like what?

1095
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,990
-去那种按摩房吗  -那是什么
- A happy ending? - What's that?

1096
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:39,200
因为我不会去的
Because I won't go there.

1097
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,280
天啊
Oh, my God.

1098
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:42,410
我不需要  我不需要那种服务  吉姆
I don't need that... I don't need that kind of massage, Jim.

1099
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,580
这不是我要的
That's not what I was...

1100
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,250
因为你知道  这很危险
Because, you know what, it's dangerous.

1101
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,790
你自己指不定会染上什么怪病
And you can pick things up.

1102
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:48,750
而你是绝对不会想知道这些怪病是什么的
You don't even wanna know what you can pick up.

1103
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:50,420
-你莫特叔叔就是这样  -别提了
- Talk to your uncle Mort. - I'd rather not.

1104
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,710
他住院两周了
He was in the hospital for two weeks.

1105
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,260
真恶心
That's disgusting.

1106
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:59,010
我是说
I was talking about

1107
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:01,310
在线约会服务
online dating services.

1108
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:04,060
不  吉姆
No, Jim.

1109
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:07,270
是啊  在我这个年纪  我觉得不行了
Yeah, right, at my age? I don't think so.

1110
00:58:07,440 --> 00:58:09,440
都这么多年没你情我爱的了
I've been out of the game for so long.

1111
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,020
当年甚至我甚至都没经历过这个过程
There wasn't even a game back then.

1112
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:15,110
爸爸  别担心  我会帮你牵上线的
Dad, don't worry. I'll hook you up.

1113
00:58:20,370 --> 00:58:21,660
你有这种相片吗
Do you have those photos?

1114
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:23,620
在这
Here you go.

1115
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:27,620
我们可能需要一些最近的照片
We might need something a little more recent.

1116
00:58:27,710 --> 00:58:28,710
你觉得呢
Do you think?

1117
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:33,460
你有更性感的装扮吗
Do you have something that's a bit sexier?

1118
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,510
明白了
Gotcha.

1119
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:40,590
你有没有
Did you...

1120
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,430
最爱的音乐
Favorite music.

1121
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:45,350
赫尔曼隐士乐队
Herman's Hermits.

1122
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,730
好的
Okay.

1123
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,560
姑娘们  一个个来
Girls, one at a time, please.

1124
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:53,070
兴趣和爱好
Interests and hobbies.

1125
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:54,320
数独
Sudoku.

1126
00:58:54,480 --> 00:58:55,570
我们一会再填
We'll come back to this one.

1127
00:59:02,490 --> 00:59:04,490
我们是不是拔得太多了
Are we sure we're not taking off too much?

1128
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:07,370
这些毛毛虫可都是我的标志
These caterpillars are kind of my trademark.

1129
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,920
好了  完美
Okay... Perfect.

1130
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,500
让我看看  我有点紧张
Take a look. I'm nervous.

1131
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:21,430
太棒了
Oh, that's fantastic!

1132
00:59:21,590 --> 00:59:24,600
真好看
That is a great look for me!

1133
00:59:25,930 --> 00:59:29,560
简洁的线条  还能移动
Leaner lines. I still have mobility.

1134
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:32,520
我三十年前怎么不这么做
Why didn't I do this 30 years ago?

1135
00:59:32,610 --> 00:59:33,610
看起来不错
Looking good.

1136
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,730
我们今晚去试试新造型吧
Why don't we test this new look out tonight?

1137
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:40,820
可是硬条今晚要举办个聚会
The thing is, Stifler is throwing a party tonight.

1138
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:42,950
好吧  那下次吧
Oh! Well, another time.

1139
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,330
你可以跟我们一起去
But you could come with us.

1140
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:47,120
出去走走会感觉很不错
It would be nice to get out of the house.

1141
00:59:47,290 --> 00:59:48,830
但是我得警告你
I do have to warn you, though,

1142
00:59:49,000 --> 00:59:52,250
硬条的聚会可能有点
Stifler's parties can get a little

1143
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,580
疯
wild.

1144
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:09,180
这是他妈是什么东西
What the fuck is this?

1145
01:00:10,020 --> 01:00:12,020
谁把音乐换了
Who the hell changed the music?

1146
01:00:12,190 --> 01:00:14,480
对不起  我觉得这个更适合孩子
Sorry, we thought this was more baby-friendly.

1147
01:00:14,650 --> 01:00:17,440
对吗  没错
Didn't we? Yes, we did.

1148
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,320
大屌硬条
Stifmeister!

1149
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,200
呸
Bluck!

1150
01:00:24,620 --> 01:00:25,820
颤个胸
Chester!

1151
01:00:28,910 --> 01:00:30,620
你们俩小子最近在忙什么
What have you cock-smokers been up to?

1152
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:33,080
-我们刚刚订婚了  -是的
- Well, we just got engaged. - Yeah.

1153
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,750
什么  这他妈太基了
What? That's so fucking gay.

1154
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,880
硬条  我们就是同性恋
Yeah, Stifler, we are gay.

1155
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,800
曲棍球队一半都是基佬
Half the lacrosse team was gay.

1156
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:44,010
你知道的  对吧
You must have known that, right?

1157
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:46,680
伙计  道格和巴里洗澡的时候你进去了
Dude, you walked in on Doug and Barry in the shower.

1158
01:00:48,010 --> 01:00:49,720
我以为他们在摔跤
I just thought they were wrestling.

1159
01:00:50,230 --> 01:00:51,230
他们确实在摔♂跤
They were.

1160
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,810
对啊  确实是
Yeah, they definitely were.

1161
01:00:52,890 --> 01:00:55,020
不过那天晚上没有失败者
There just wasn't a loser that night.

1162
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,900
这里真的是硬条家吗
Are we sure this is Stifler's?

1163
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,910
冷盘
Hors d'oeuvres!

1164
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,660
把这个交给主人吧  儿子
Why don't you give this to our host, son?

1165
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:14,710
我的天啊  看看是谁
Oh, my God! Look who it is.

1166
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:19,420
昨晚很抱歉打扰你们
Sorry for interrupting you guys last night.

1167
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,760
顺便说下  非常棒
Bravo, by the way.

1168
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:24,680
大多数女人结婚后就不那么做了
Most wives stop doing that after they get the ring.

1169
01:01:24,840 --> 01:01:26,680
-你们在说什么  -你染了发吗
- What are you talking about? - Did you change your hair color?

1170
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:32,220
你那个喜欢熟女的朋友今晚来了吗
So, is your buddy, the other MILF guy, here tonight?

1171
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,180
我觉得你们总是一起来的
I thought you always come to these things together.

1172
01:01:35,060 --> 01:01:39,060
这么说吧  我们已经分道扬镳了
Let's just say that friendship is a two-way street.

1173
01:01:40,610 --> 01:01:42,110
很抱歉
Excuse me.

1174
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:47,450
这派对还能再烂点吗
Could this party get any lamer?

1175
01:01:48,450 --> 01:01:50,080
没有那么差吧
It's not so bad.

1176
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,250
要来点刺激吗
You want some E?

1177
01:01:53,410 --> 01:01:55,120
不要  你怎么把这东西弄来了
No. Why do you have that?

1178
01:01:55,580 --> 01:01:57,960
这里的其他人都没有
No one else here probably has any.

1179
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,130
你确定你不要吗
Are you sure you don't want one?

1180
01:01:59,290 --> 01:02:00,290
是啊
Yeah.

1181
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:01,590
不要  要
No... Yes.

1182
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:02,670
不要
No.

1183
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,970
好吧  我都吃了
Okay. Fine. More for me, then.

1184
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:11,850
他们在那
And there they are.

1185
01:02:12,020 --> 01:02:13,180
小芬
Finchy.

1186
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:17,730
你们在这啊  看看  你们能相信吗
There you guys are. Look around. Can you believe this shit?

1187
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:19,690
老兄  很好嘛
Yeah, man. Nice work.

1188
01:02:19,860 --> 01:02:21,270
给你的
For you.

1189
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,110
我拿这玩意做什么
What the hell am I supposed to do with this?

1190
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,740
那可是正经的红酒  硬条
That's called wine, Stifler.

1191
01:02:24,900 --> 01:02:26,530
不不  别在我的舞会上喝
No, no, no, no, not at my party.

1192
01:02:26,610 --> 01:02:27,910
我给大家来点烈的
I'm going to get us some shots.

1193
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,370
凯文
Hey, Kev.

1194
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:32,030
我能跟你们谈谈吗
Can I talk to you guys for a sec?

1195
01:02:32,370 --> 01:02:34,370
好的  在这等我  我马上回来
Yeah, sure. Wait here, I'll be right back.

1196
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:38,080
东西带过来没
So, you brought the goods?

1197
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:39,540
在这呢
Right here.

1198
01:02:39,710 --> 01:02:41,250
我想看看
I want to see.

1199
01:02:43,710 --> 01:02:46,720
那群蠢货去哪了
What the... Where did those fuckers go?

1200
01:02:47,050 --> 01:02:48,050
你好  斯蒂文
Hello, Steven.

1201
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:50,390
-莱文斯汀先生  -是我
- Mr. Levenstein. - Yes.

1202
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:51,550
你也来了
You made it.

1203
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,350
真高兴看到你们都回来了
It is so great to see all you kids back in town.

1204
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:58,940
你今天晚上办的宴会棒极了
And what a terrific soiree you're throwing here tonight.

1205
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:00,940
简直太棒了
Just wonderful!

1206
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:04,780
跟你说  我他妈要灌死你
You know what? I'm going to get you fucked up.

1207
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,150
干一杯
Have a shot.

1208
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,900
不  不  不
Oh! No, no, no.

1209
01:03:08,070 --> 01:03:11,450
别这样  斯蒂文  我不怎么会喝酒
I don't think so, Steven. I'm not much of a drinker.

1210
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:13,580
-干了  干了  -不  我不行
- Drink it. Drink it! Drink it! - No, I can't.

1211
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,160
干了吧  干了吧
Drink it! Drink it!

1212
01:03:17,250 --> 01:03:18,330
棒极了  咱俩再干一杯
Awesome! Let's do another one.

1213
01:03:18,410 --> 01:03:19,580
我不能再喝了
I don't think so.

1214
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:22,000
听着  凯文  你还不确定到底发生了什么
Look, Kev, you don't know for sure if anything happened.

1215
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:24,150
我醒来发现她躺在旁边
I woke up next to her in bed,

1216
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,420
我们俩还都光着身子
and all our clothes were off.

1217
01:03:25,590 --> 01:03:28,260
不管发生什么  我都很内疚
I mean, whatever happened, I feel guilty.

1218
01:03:28,420 --> 01:03:30,090
凯文  在法国
Kevin, in France,

1219
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,830
只有被老婆当场捉奸
it's only considered cheating

1220
01:03:31,830 --> 01:03:33,930
你才算是不忠
if your wife catches you in the act.

1221
01:03:37,310 --> 01:03:38,310
她也在这
She's here.

1222
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,020
我得走了
I gotta go.

1223
01:03:42,310 --> 01:03:43,940
好吧  准备好
All right, get ready.

1224
01:03:44,110 --> 01:03:46,570
等一下  等一下
Wait for it. Wait for it!

1225
01:03:46,650 --> 01:03:47,690
等一下
Wait for it!

1226
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:49,320
开喝吧
Here she comes!

1227
01:03:50,860 --> 01:03:52,610
真他妈强  莱文斯汀先生
Fuck yeah, Mr. Levenstein!

1228
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,910
大爷我叫诺亚  小王八蛋
The name is Noah, motherfucker.

1229
01:03:59,290 --> 01:04:00,620
这沙发真舒服
Feel the sofa.

1230
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:03,460
这么光滑
It's so smooth.

1231
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:06,800
摸起来就像蓝精灵的屁股
It feels like a Smurf's ass.

1232
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,300
来爽一下
Did you feel it?

1233
01:04:08,460 --> 01:04:11,510
好吧  蜜儿  你能...
Okay. Mia, can you...

1234
01:04:13,010 --> 01:04:14,970
各位  我们来迟了
Hey, guys. Sorry we're late.

1235
01:04:17,220 --> 01:04:19,060
我给大家带了点东西
Hey, I got a treat for everybody.

1236
01:04:19,060 --> 01:04:20,310
今晚让大家饱饱眼福
I picked something up.

1237
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:21,230
热舞明星第六季
Celebrity Dance Off, Season Six.

1238
01:04:21,230 --> 01:04:23,150
看你的了  克里斯?奥斯莱克
My man, Chris Ostreicher.

1239
01:04:23,230 --> 01:04:24,230
老天啊
Oh, my God.

1240
01:04:26,860 --> 01:04:28,860
我们一定得看看
We have to watch this.

1241
01:04:29,030 --> 01:04:31,700
谁想看我的宝贝扭屁股
Who wants to see my baby shake his booty?

1242
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,780
反正人家想看
I know I do.

1243
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:37,280
犹太约会网  你在开玩笑吧
JDate? You have to be kidding me.

1244
01:04:37,450 --> 01:04:39,240
如果你想操上好逼
If you want quality vag,

1245
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,700
你就得多出门野去
you have to go out into the wild.

1246
01:04:40,870 --> 01:04:42,120
"逼"
"Vag"?

1247
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:44,830
那是什么  一半阴道么
What is that, a half of a vagina?

1248
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:49,170
我们年轻的时候都叫鲍鱼
You know, in my day we called it a beaver.

1249
01:04:49,340 --> 01:04:53,180
我告诉你  我还抓住过一两只
And let me tell you something, I snagged a pelt or two.

1250
01:04:53,340 --> 01:04:54,380
那是当然
I bet you did.

1251
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:55,510
老爸
Dad?

1252
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,010
吉姆  你老爸比你酷多了
Hey, Jim, your dad is so much cooler than you.

1253
01:04:58,100 --> 01:04:59,770
硬条  别再给我爸灌黄汤了
Stifler, please stop getting my dad drunk.

1254
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,180
没  他在帮我找逼操呢
No, he's just trying to get me some vag.

1255
01:05:02,270 --> 01:05:03,270
得了吧
Okay, come on.

1256
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,860
让你爸自己选吧
Let the man make his own decisions.

1257
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:08,070
别了  走吧
Stop. Come on.

1258
01:05:08,150 --> 01:05:09,150
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

1259
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,150
我想要你擦亮陈旧的钢枪
I want you to dust off that old dick of yours,

1260
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,320
从这里走出去  泡几个妞回来
go out there, and get some ass.

1261
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:15,660
快出去吧
Oh! Just go out there.

1262
01:05:15,740 --> 01:05:16,870
我想我能办到
I think I will.

1263
01:05:17,030 --> 01:05:19,830
-老爸  别  -我也是这么想的
- Dad, stop, okay? - It's exactly what I'm gonna...

1264
01:05:19,910 --> 01:05:22,580
对不起  但是你今晚喝高了
I'm sorry, but you have had a little too much to drink tonight,

1265
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:23,960
-我不会让你...  -不  不
- and I'm not letting you... - No, no.

1266
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,420
别  儿子  我就喝了一杯
No, son, I haven't hardly had one drink.

1267
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:29,880
你知道我爱你
And you know I love you.

1268
01:05:30,050 --> 01:05:34,260
我确实爱你  但是你得
I do love you, but you need to

1269
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:36,680
蛋定
chillax.

1270
01:05:37,260 --> 01:05:39,350
"蛋定"  老爸  你去哪啊
"Chillax"? Dad, where are you going?

1271
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:40,800
你看到他那个样子了吗
Do you see him?

1272
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,720
吉姆  吉姆  让他去吧  让他找点乐子
Jim! Jim! Let him go. Let him have some fun.

1273
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:47,560
现在我们也可以找点乐子
And now we can have some fun.

1274
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:49,770
来吧
Come on.

1275
01:05:51,570 --> 01:05:53,030
让一下
Excuse me.

1276
01:05:53,190 --> 01:05:55,070
对不起  请让下
I'm sorry, excuse me.

1277
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,320
这是洗手间吗
Is this a washroom?

1278
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:59,830
你意识不到自己太自以为事的原因
It doesn't even occur to you that you're self-centered

1279
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:02,830
就是因为你太自以为事了
because you are so self-centered and...

1280
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:04,790
等一下  别挂电话
You know what? Hold on a second.

1281
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:07,870
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

1282
01:06:09,420 --> 01:06:10,790
您是哪位
Who might you be?

1283
01:06:10,960 --> 01:06:12,590
我是硬条他妈
I'm Stifler's mom.

1284
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:16,420
我是吉姆他爹
I'm Jim's dad.

1285
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:19,260
别了  混蛋
Later, fucker.

1286
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:23,850
一旦给她甜头
She won't ever get enough

1287
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:25,770
她就得寸进尺
Once she gets a little touch

1288
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:27,300
如果让我来对付她
If I had it my way

1289
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:32,610
你知道我会让她爽翻天
You know that I'd make her say ooooooh

1290
01:06:32,610 --> 01:06:34,390
一旦给她甜头
She won't ever get enough

1291
01:06:34,390 --> 01:06:36,110
她就得寸进尺
Once she gets a little touch

1292
01:06:36,110 --> 01:06:37,700
如果让我来对付她
If I had it my way

1293
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:41,240
天哪  这是我见过的最荒谬的东西了
Oh, my God, this is the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen.

1294
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:46,550
我的初吻就像这样发生
Well my first kiss went a little like this

1295
01:06:48,710 --> 01:06:50,580
老兄  你身材棒极了
Dude, you have an amazing body!

1296
01:06:50,670 --> 01:06:55,130
大家为克里斯?奥斯莱克大声欢呼吧
Everybody, raise the roof for Chris Ostreicher!

1297
01:06:55,210 --> 01:06:57,220
整整一季以来你都做得很好
You have really been bringing it all season long.

1298
01:06:57,300 --> 01:06:58,910
不过现在是检验全国观众
But now it's time, Chris,

1299
01:06:58,910 --> 01:07:01,800
是否觉得你真配待在这的时候了
to see if America thinks you done brought it.

1300
01:07:02,470 --> 01:07:03,890
-准备好了吗  -放马过来吧
- You ready?   - Let's do it.

1301
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:04,970
让我们揭晓答案
Let's see the results.

1302
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,820
什么  吉尔伯特?加德弗莱竟然赢了你
What? Gilbert Gottfried and not you?

1303
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,110
真他妈操蛋
Fucking bullshit!

1304
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:17,400
克里斯  真遗憾
Chris, I'm so sorry, man.

1305
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:22,160
我们看着你启动  现在该刹车了
Well, we saw you jam. Now, it's time to scram.

1306
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,410
你还有什么想对观众说的吗
Do you have any last thoughts for the audience?

1307
01:07:24,580 --> 01:07:27,080
大家  我们就看到这吧
Okay, guys, we can probably end it there.

1308
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,500
什么  你开玩笑吧  我还没看完呢
What? No, are you kidding? I haven't seen this.

1309
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,000
我想我学到的就是我们得对自己
I think what I've learned is to be true

1310
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,170
真诚
to myself,

1311
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:36,340
因为这正是舞蹈的精神  真诚的精神
because that's what dancing is, it's truth.

1312
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,590
也许
And maybe,

1313
01:07:38,840 --> 01:07:42,010
如果我们每个人多跳一会儿
if we just danced a little bit more,

1314
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:45,560
就不会再有战争了
there would be no more wars.

1315
01:07:47,430 --> 01:07:48,850
没有战争
No more war!

1316
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:51,230
外交部倒可以认真考虑考虑这条建议
Well, that is a thoughtful take on foreign policy.

1317
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:55,230
别换台  稍后为您带来胡克?霍根的热舞
Stick around. Hulk Hogan gets jiggy-friggy, right after this.

1318
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,690
你不会想错过的  千万不要转台
You don't want to miss this. Stick around.

1319
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:09,200
就我看来  我觉得你被骗了
If you want my opinion, I think you got cheated.

1320
01:08:11,290 --> 01:08:12,460
没事吧
Are you okay?

1321
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,040
你知道吗  当你...
You know,when the...

1322
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:17,510
当你失去对你很重要的东西
when you lose something that's important to you,

1323
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:18,800
那感觉一点都不好
it doesn't feel very good.

1324
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:21,630
奥兹  那只是个真人秀而已
Oz, it's just a show.

1325
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:24,800
我说的不是真人秀
I'm not talking about the show.

1326
01:08:32,020 --> 01:08:33,900
海瑟  你在下面吗
Hey, Heather, you down there?

1327
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:35,980
马上到
Um, coming!

1328
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:38,400
天哪
Oh, my God.

1329
01:08:38,570 --> 01:08:39,860
等一下  我马上回来
Wait here, I'll be right back.

1330
01:08:41,530 --> 01:08:43,700
我都记不清多少次走进斯蒂文的房间
I can't tell you how many times I walked into Steven's room

1331
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:46,700
刚好看到他和其他女孩做爱的场景
and I caught him in the middle of sex with some girl.

1332
01:08:46,870 --> 01:08:49,660
至少他是和活生生的人类女孩在做
At least he was with a real, live human girl.

1333
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:51,040
你什么意思
What are you talking about?

1334
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,690
有一次我走进厨房
I walked into the kitchen once,

1335
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:55,250
我看到吉姆在插一个派
and I saw Jim humping a pie.

1336
01:08:57,340 --> 01:09:00,960
那个派瞬间就成了一堆渣渣
He turned the damn thing into a crumble in about two seconds.

1337
01:09:05,680 --> 01:09:07,260
我这个能超过你的
I can top that.

1338
01:09:07,430 --> 01:09:08,640
有一次我走进卧室
I once walked into my bedroom

1339
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:12,100
看到斯蒂文把我的梳子插进了他的屁股
and I caught Steven sticking my hairbrush up his ass.

1340
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:18,020
而且插进去的还不是手柄的那边
No, and it wasn't the handle side, either.

1341
01:09:23,950 --> 01:09:26,280
别  别  别
No, no, no.

1342
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:32,200
像你这样的窈窕淑女不应该贪杯的
A pretty lady like you shouldn't be drinking quite so much.

1343
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:34,330
我也不能喝了
And neither should I.

1344
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:42,300
来跟大麻怎么样
How about a joint, then?

1345
01:09:45,340 --> 01:09:49,470
我们不必等上十三年再见面
We don't have to wait 13 years to see each other again.

1346
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:51,220
那倒是
Yeah, true.

1347
01:09:51,390 --> 01:09:55,350
我想哪次可以和你一起去冒冒险
And I guess I could come along on one of your adventures.

1348
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,400
我是做助手的料吗
Am I good sidekick material?

1349
01:09:58,480 --> 01:09:59,520
助手
Sidekick?

1350
01:09:59,610 --> 01:10:04,570
你可不止是当助手的料
I think you are a lot more than sidekick material.

1351
01:10:10,330 --> 01:10:12,160
出什么事了吗
Is everything okay?

1352
01:10:14,830 --> 01:10:16,830
旧的不去新的不来
It's better than ever.

1353
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:22,130
等等  等等
Okay, wait, wait.

1354
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:26,130
这么重要的场合穿这样可不合适
I don't think we're dressed appropriately for the occasion.

1355
01:10:26,300 --> 01:10:27,840
穿上这个
Put that on.

1356
01:10:28,010 --> 01:10:29,340
你要去哪
Wait, where are you going?

1357
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:32,350
去换衣服  马上回来
To change. Be back soon.

1358
01:10:42,860 --> 01:10:44,070
老兄
Dudes!

1359
01:10:45,860 --> 01:10:47,450
有何贵干  兄弟
What's up, bro?

1360
01:10:48,410 --> 01:10:50,370
大硬条
Big Stiffy?

1361
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:52,620
吹箫皇后小莱
Blowjob Lipstein.

1362
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:58,370
苍天啊  你他妈是在耍我吧
Oh, you have to be fucking kidding me!

1363
01:10:58,580 --> 01:10:59,710
怎么了
Excuse me?

1364
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,470
好了
Okay.

1365
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,510
你他妈在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

1366
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:11,260
你就光想着让我给你吹
You just expect me to blow you?

1367
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:12,390
当然
Yeah!

1368
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:13,930
我要走了
I'm out of here.

1369
01:11:14,100 --> 01:11:15,600
等下  等下  等下
Wait. Wait, wait!

1370
01:11:15,770 --> 01:11:17,230
听着  我懂了
Look, I get it.

1371
01:11:17,390 --> 01:11:19,060
你对你的身材不自信
You're self-conscious about your body.

1372
01:11:19,770 --> 01:11:22,610
不用担心  一会我肯定会关灯的
Don't worry. I was going to shut the lights off anyway.

1373
01:11:22,770 --> 01:11:25,400
你还是高中时候那个混账
You are the same douchebag that you were in high school.

1374
01:11:25,900 --> 01:11:28,200
你就想我为你服务周全
You just expect me to do everything

1375
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:29,610
而我却什么好处都捞不到
while I get nothing?

1376
01:11:29,780 --> 01:11:30,780
想得美
Later.

1377
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,070
不  不
No, no!

1378
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:38,120
我们做个交易吧
Let's make a deal.

1379
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,790
我让你爽  你也得让我爽
I'll get you off, you get me off.

1380
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,840
你什么意见
What do you say?

1381
01:11:45,170 --> 01:11:46,420
成交
Fine.

1382
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:48,920
不过你得卖点力了
But I am putting you to work.

1383
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:50,680
我操
Holy shit.

1384
01:11:51,840 --> 01:11:53,600
吃饭时间到
Chow time!

1385
01:11:57,020 --> 01:11:58,890
你在这
There you are!

1386
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:01,770
我一直在找你
I've been looking all over for you.

1387
01:12:01,940 --> 01:12:04,520
听着  我们真的得...
Listen, we really need to...

1388
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:07,780
你要做什么
What are you doing?

1389
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:09,360
抓紧属于我的
Taking what's mine.

1390
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:14,620
没  我就想听听你的声音
No, I just wanted to hear the sound of your voice.

1391
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:17,450
一切还好吧  你听起来挺紧张的
Aw, is everything okay? You seem stressed.

1392
01:12:17,870 --> 01:12:19,500
紧张
Stressed?

1393
01:12:21,330 --> 01:12:23,120
找到你了
There you are!

1394
01:12:24,630 --> 01:12:26,670
不  不  不
No, no, no.

1395
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,550
我得挂了  不过一会就回你电话
I have to go right now, but I'll call you back in a little bit.

1396
01:12:30,720 --> 01:12:32,640
不用担心
Okay. And don't worry,

1397
01:12:32,640 --> 01:12:33,970
我不会趁你不在看绯闻女孩的
I won't watch Gossip Girl without you.

1398
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:35,050
我想你  宝贝
I miss you, babe.

1399
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:36,550
我也想你
I miss you, too.

1400
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:43,480
听着  碧琪  关于昨晚
Listen, Vicky, about last night,

1401
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:45,650
那不是我真正想做的
that wasn't me.

1402
01:12:45,810 --> 01:12:47,900
发生的事情  你懂的
With what happened, you know.

1403
01:12:48,570 --> 01:12:51,150
我不知道  在你看来可能挺正常的
I don't know. It might be normal in your world.

1404
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,070
你以为发生什么了
What do you think happened?

1405
01:12:53,530 --> 01:12:55,870
我们的衣服都在地板上
Well, all our clothes were on the floor.

1406
01:12:56,030 --> 01:12:57,330
那都是因为你喝醉了掉湖里
Yeah, because they were soaking wet

1407
01:12:57,410 --> 01:12:59,080
衣服才全湿透了
from when you got drunk and fell in the lake.

1408
01:12:59,250 --> 01:13:00,750
我照顾的你
I took care of you.

1409
01:13:00,910 --> 01:13:03,750
所以我们没做爱
So, we didn't have sex?

1410
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,040
当然没有
Of course not.

1411
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,670
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God!

1412
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,920
我真高兴原来你这么高看我
I'm glad you think so highly of me.

1413
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,010
不是
No.

1414
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:17,100
碧琪  等等
Vicky, wait.

1415
01:13:18,100 --> 01:13:21,180
哦  老天啊
Oh, yeah! Oh, my God!

1416
01:13:21,350 --> 01:13:22,850
蜜儿  停下来
Mia, stop.

1417
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:25,850
哦  老天啊
Oh, my God, yeah!

1418
01:13:26,020 --> 01:13:27,230
蜜儿  快下去
Mia, get off!

1419
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,190
我要丢了  要丢了
I'm about to! I'm about to!

1420
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:32,530
海瑟
Heather.

1421
01:13:34,860 --> 01:13:35,910
怎么搞的
What the hell?

1422
01:13:37,030 --> 01:13:38,700
你和这个骚货有一腿
You have something going on with this skank?

1423
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,870
你叫谁骚货呢  你个臭婊子
Who are you calling a skank, you fucking bitch?

1424
01:13:45,580 --> 01:13:46,750
住手  住手
Stop it! Stop!

1425
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:47,920
快住手
Stop it!

1426
01:13:49,550 --> 01:13:51,300
他妈的
Ow! What the fuck?

1427
01:13:51,460 --> 01:13:53,630
那是我才接的发  疯婊子
That's my extension, you bitch!

1428
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,430
你个狗日的
You motherfucker!

1429
01:13:55,590 --> 01:13:57,840
不要  蜜儿  快住手
No, Mia! Wait a minute!

1430
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:02,060
顺便说一声  我操过马里奥?洛佩兹
By the way, I fucked Mario Lopez!

1431
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,980
该轮我了吧
Okay, it's my turn now.

1432
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:15,650
这次可不行
Uh-uh. Not this time.

1433
01:14:15,820 --> 01:14:17,570
我们说好的呢
Wait, what about our deal?

1434
01:14:17,740 --> 01:14:21,370
让你也尝尝这种滋味  大硬条
Now you know how it feels, Big Stiffy.

1435
01:14:28,540 --> 01:14:29,880
好恶心
Gross!

1436
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:37,470
我他妈要吐了
Fuckin' yuck!

1437
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:57,030
你没真以为我又睡着了吧
You didn't actually think I'd fall asleep again, did you?

1438
01:14:57,200 --> 01:14:59,030
只要你是我的  我就很开心了
As long as you're mine, I'm happy.

1439
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,910
老天啊  凯菈  你在这干什么
Jesus, Kara. What are you doing here?

1440
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,240
你那个猥琐的朋友邀请了我和所有姐妹
Your creepy friend invited me and all my girlfriends.

1441
01:15:03,410 --> 01:15:05,790
装备不错  原来你还有这个癖好啊
Nice outfit, by the way. Very kinky.

1442
01:15:06,660 --> 01:15:07,710
糟了
Oh, shit.

1443
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,120
别担心  我反锁了
Don't worry. I locked it.

1444
01:15:12,710 --> 01:15:14,000
老天啊
Oh, Jesus.

1445
01:15:17,630 --> 01:15:20,680
你们他妈的在这搞什么鬼呢
What the hell kind of freaky shit is going on in here?

1446
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,100
AJ  你来这做什么
AJ, what are you doing here?

1447
01:15:22,260 --> 01:15:24,140
我跟着你  我得亲眼看到才瞑目
I followed you. I had to see it with my own eyes.

1448
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:26,470
你先搞坏了我的水上摩托
First you fuck with my jet ski,

1449
01:15:26,470 --> 01:15:27,930
现在你又来搞我女朋友
then you fuck my girlfriend?

1450
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,350
不  老天啊  没有  什么都没发生
No! God, no! Nothing happened.

1451
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:31,600
你死定了  桑德勒
You're going down, Sandier.

1452
01:15:31,730 --> 01:15:33,190
桑德勒  搞什么
Sandier? What the...

1453
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,820
老天啊
Jesus Christ!

1454
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:38,240
我要把你碎尸万段
I'm going to kill you!

1455
01:15:40,070 --> 01:15:42,240
吉姆  你他妈穿着什么鬼东西
Jim, what the fuck are you wearing?

1456
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:44,830
听我解释啊  老天
Hey, I can explain everything! Jesus!

1457
01:15:45,620 --> 01:15:46,660
快起来  垃圾
Come on! Shit!

1458
01:15:46,790 --> 01:15:48,330
站起来  你这挨操的货
Get up, gimp!

1459
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,500
行了  我不会和你打架的  好吗
Come on, I'm not fighting you, okay?

1460
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,170
这太蠢了  我是个成年人
This is silly. I'm an adult.

1461
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:53,380
真的吗
Oh, really?

1462
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,460
在我看来你就是个任人骑的娘们
Because to me you look like a little bitch pussy.

1463
01:15:56,630 --> 01:15:58,380
爷们点  吉姆
Don't be a pussy, Jim.

1464
01:15:58,550 --> 01:16:01,130
听着  AJ  冷静下来  好吗
Look, AJ, just calm down, okay?

1465
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:02,390
谁给你们的狗胆
What makes you little fuckers

1466
01:16:02,390 --> 01:16:04,390
让你们敢在我大屌硬条家撒野
think you can crash one of the Stifmeister's parties?

1467
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:07,930
你刚才是不是说你是大屌硬条
Did you just refer to yourself as "The Stifmeister"?

1468
01:16:08,100 --> 01:16:11,230
这是我所听过最傻的名字了
Because that's the lamest name ever!

1469
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:15,940
我要他妈的宰了你
I'm going to fucking kill you.

1470
01:16:16,110 --> 01:16:17,070
放马过来吧
Bring it on.

1471
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:18,650
史蒂夫  得了吧  这太可笑了
Hey, Steve, come on, this is...

1472
01:16:23,990 --> 01:16:25,990
你以为你能逃哪去
Where do you think you're going?

1473
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:33,460
别和99级学长过不去  贱人
Don't mess with the Class of '99, bitch!

1474
01:16:34,670 --> 01:16:35,840
芬治
Finch!

1475
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:37,670
别伤害我朋友
Don't hurt my friend!

1476
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:56,940
放开我丈夫  你这臭小子
Get off my husband, you little piece of shit!

1477
01:17:08,870 --> 01:17:11,870
糟了  条子来了
Oh, crap! It's the fuzz!

1478
01:17:12,620 --> 01:17:14,830
我们得逃出去  怎么逃出去
We have to get out. How do you get out?

1479
01:17:15,040 --> 01:17:16,250
我需要逃跑路线
I need an escape route!

1480
01:17:16,420 --> 01:17:18,000
糟了
Oh, shit!

1481
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:19,170
你想和他在一起
You want to be with him?

1482
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:21,880
好了  成全你们
Fine! He's all yours.

1483
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:23,470
快跑  兄弟们
Come on, man!

1484
01:17:25,470 --> 01:17:27,850
吉姆  出什么事了
Jim, what's going on?

1485
01:17:28,010 --> 01:17:30,060
都是我的错  我可以向你们解释的
I am so sorry for all of this. I can explain.

1486
01:17:30,770 --> 01:17:33,060
昨晚我碰巧遇到我们邻居凯菈
Last night I ran into Kara, our neighbor.

1487
01:17:33,270 --> 01:17:36,310
她喝醉了开不了车  所以我把她送回家
She was too drunk to drive, so I drove her home.

1488
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:41,280
然后她开始脱她的衣服  摸我的...
And she started taking off her clothes, and touching my...

1489
01:17:41,610 --> 01:17:44,250
我知道不好听
Okay, I know it doesn't sound good,

1490
01:17:44,250 --> 01:17:45,030
但是什么都没发生  好吗
but nothing happened, okay?

1491
01:17:45,200 --> 01:17:47,280
我根本不在乎她
I don't care about her at all!

1492
01:17:47,450 --> 01:17:49,990
真谢谢你了
Thanks a lot.

1493
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,910
不  凯菈  等等  我不是那个意思
No, no, Kara, wait. I didn't mean...

1494
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:54,790
别走  米雪  等一下  等一下
Wait, Michelle. Hold on, hold on.

1495
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:56,370
不是你想的那样  好吗
It's not what you think, okay?

1496
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:01,050
我发誓  我就是想把事办好  但是...
I swear, I was just trying to do the right thing, and I...

1497
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:03,760
你得相信我  米雪  求求你了
You have to believe me, Michelle, please.

1498
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,800
不管是不是真的
Whether I believe you or not,

1499
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:09,390
我都很失望
I'm disappointed.

1500
01:18:09,810 --> 01:18:12,270
我要回娘家住一段时间
I'm going to stay with my grandmother.

1501
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:13,430
别走  米雪
Hold it, Michelle.

1502
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:14,520
别  吉姆
No, Jim.

1503
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:16,690
打架的都跑了  老兄
Hey, the fight's over, guys.

1504
01:18:16,850 --> 01:18:18,270
我们不是来管斗殴的
We're not here to stop a fight.

1505
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,860
我们是来找被偷的摩托车的
We're here about that stolen motorcycle.

1506
01:18:21,020 --> 01:18:22,690
这辆的车辆识别码刚好匹配
Looks like the VIN numbers match up.

1507
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,110
保罗?芬治
Paul Finch.

1508
01:18:24,280 --> 01:18:26,030
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

1509
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:28,610
太牛逼了
Awesome!

1510
01:18:28,950 --> 01:18:30,120
搞错了吧  警官
Excuse me, officer.

1511
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:33,690
那是他赌赢了阿根廷的世界杯冠军赢的车
He won that bike betting on the World Cup in Argentina.

1512
01:18:33,690 --> 01:18:34,750
你们一定搞错了
You made some sort of mistake.

1513
01:18:34,830 --> 01:18:36,790
保罗  到底怎么回事  都怎么了
Paul, what's going on? What is this about?

1514
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:38,250
保罗
Paul.

1515
01:18:38,420 --> 01:18:39,710
芬治  给他们讲清楚
Finch, just tell them.

1516
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:41,040
保罗
Paul!

1517
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:43,710
狗屎  今天晚上
Hey, shitbreak, when you're

1518
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:45,800
被狱友蹂躏的时候
getting rammed by your cellmate tonight,

1519
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:47,090
想想凯文
think of Kevin.

1520
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,140
米雪  我能...  求你了
Michelle, can I just... Please!

1521
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:02,020
老爸
Dad? Ah!

1522
01:19:06,570 --> 01:19:07,570
老爸
Dad?

1523
01:19:08,490 --> 01:19:09,910
老爸  你在搞什么
Dad, what are you doing?

1524
01:19:10,070 --> 01:19:12,830
你没见过我  我没来过这
You didn't see me! I'm not here!

1525
01:19:12,990 --> 01:19:14,160
我没来过
I'm not here!

1526
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:16,910
他还好吧
Is he all right?

1527
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,250
我不知道
I don't know.

1528
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,250
我们要怎么救芬治
What are we going to do about Finch?

1529
01:19:21,420 --> 01:19:23,670
去芬治他妈的  让他在监狱过夜吧
Fuck Finch. Let him spend the night in jail.

1530
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:25,050
别这样  硬条
Come on, Stifler!

1531
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:26,340
你这也算朋友
Some friend you are.

1532
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,130
别给我提朋友
What about you guys?

1533
01:19:30,340 --> 01:19:33,390
你们不给我打电话  不给我发邮件
You don't call me, you don't e-mail,

1534
01:19:33,470 --> 01:19:35,600
不在我脸书主页上回复
you don't comment on my Facebook page.

1535
01:19:35,680 --> 01:19:36,480
你们甚至都不让我知道
You guys didn't even let

1536
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,980
你们是为了高中重聚才回来的
me know you were coming back for the reunion.

1537
01:19:38,140 --> 01:19:39,410
那是因为我们知道
Because we knew, somehow,

1538
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:41,440
不管怎样你都会把事情搞砸的
you would find a way to screw things up.

1539
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,610
都是我的错  吉姆
Oh, I'm sorry, Jim.

1540
01:19:43,770 --> 01:19:45,360
我他妈想让大家这周末过得爽一点
I wanted us to have a fucking fun time

1541
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,940
就像我们以前在高中时一样
this weekend, like we did in high school.

1542
01:19:47,110 --> 01:19:49,110
但是我们都不是高中生了
But we're not in high school anymore.

1543
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:50,780
你太过执念于过去了  硬条
You are so trapped in the past, Stifler.

1544
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:52,060
你什么时候才能意识到
When are you going to realize

1545
01:19:52,070 --> 01:19:53,990
一切都不会变成原来的样子呢
that things will never be the way they used to be?

1546
01:20:01,120 --> 01:20:02,330
好吧
Fine.

1547
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:05,340
我猜聚会该结束了
Guess the party's over.

1548
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:08,880
你们这帮混球
Dicks.

1549
01:20:41,420 --> 01:20:43,710
昨天的聚会棒极了
Well, that was a great party.

1550
01:20:44,170 --> 01:20:46,540
实话实说我真玩爽了
I honestly think I had fun.

1551
01:20:48,510 --> 01:20:51,220
好吧  至少还有个人爽了
Well, that makes one of us.

1552
01:20:53,550 --> 01:20:54,890
米雪有没有给你打电话
Have you heard from Michelle?

1553
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:58,310
没  她不想和我说话
No. She doesn't want to talk to me.

1554
01:20:58,600 --> 01:21:00,390
今晚的重聚怎么办
What about the reunion tonight?

1555
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:02,600
她说她可能来也可能不来
She said she may or may not come.

1556
01:21:02,770 --> 01:21:04,560
你们俩怎么了
What's going on with you two?

1557
01:21:04,730 --> 01:21:06,270
吉姆  你有什么想和老爸聊的吗
Jim, is there anything you want to talk about?

1558
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:11,490
好吧
Okay.

1559
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:17,160
你和老妈
How often

1560
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:20,660
多久...
did you and Mom...

1561
01:21:23,830 --> 01:21:25,120
那个那个
You know?

1562
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,290
这就是问题所在
Is that what this is about?

1563
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,210
你和米雪已经不...
You and Michelle haven't been...

1564
01:21:29,380 --> 01:21:31,210
最近都没
Not lately, no.

1565
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:36,720
你是不是
Is it

1566
01:21:36,890 --> 01:21:38,390
不举了
an erectile problem?

1567
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:43,560
有时你可以用你灵巧的大拇指
Because sometimes you can buy a little time

1568
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,020
争取点时间
with a well-placed thumb.

1569
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,980
-老天啊  -我只是说说看
- Oh, God. - I'm just saying.

1570
01:21:47,060 --> 01:21:48,940
-我那里没问题  -不是这个问题
- I don't think that's it. - That's not it?

1571
01:21:49,230 --> 01:21:51,050
这可是我们家的独门秘诀
Oh! That's something to keep

1572
01:21:51,050 --> 01:21:54,030
可从来没有失手过
in your back pocket, because that's a no-fail.

1573
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,860
让我们换个话题吧
Okay, let's be done with that.

1574
01:21:56,030 --> 01:21:59,450
本来一切都好好的
No, things in that department were fine.

1575
01:22:00,660 --> 01:22:02,750
然后伊凡出生了
And then Evan was born

1576
01:22:02,950 --> 01:22:05,830
我们俩就停了
and we kind of stopped.

1577
01:22:06,080 --> 01:22:09,920
我们自从那就没做过了  你知道吧
And they haven't really picked up since, you know?

1578
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:13,960
这不成问题  别担心
This is not a problem, so do not worry.

1579
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:15,930
-你能理解  -是的  听着  吉姆
- You understand? - Yeah, listen, Jim.

1580
01:22:16,090 --> 01:22:17,550
在你出生之前
Before you were born,

1581
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,600
你妈妈和我就像干柴遇到烈火
your mother and I, we would do it every day.

1582
01:22:20,680 --> 01:22:21,680
我不想听这个
I don't need this.

1583
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:24,100
有时每天要两三次呢
Sometimes two or three times a day.

1584
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:25,590
那都是七十年代的事了
This is back in the '70s.

1585
01:22:25,590 --> 01:22:27,770
我们试验了许多不同的体位
A lot of experimentation was going on.

1586
01:22:27,980 --> 01:22:32,690
你老妈最爱一招她叫做"全身总动员"的
Your mother favored something she called, "Diving for dollars."

1587
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:35,820
老天啊  对不起  我不想听
Holy shit. I'm sorry, I don't need...

1588
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:38,280
没关系  我们可以...  我懂了
That's fine, we can... I get it.

1589
01:22:38,450 --> 01:22:39,700
我可以给你将给其他的
I don't have to go on with that.

1590
01:22:39,780 --> 01:22:42,860
我的重点是当你有了孩子
But my point is, when you have a kid,

1591
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:45,250
你们就为人父母了
you become a dad and a mom.

1592
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:49,830
但是更重要的是不要忘记你们还是夫妻
But it's very important not to stop being a husband and a wife.

1593
01:22:50,420 --> 01:22:53,960
如果你们记着这点  爱就能继续做下去
And if you do that, the sex will come.

1594
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,510
这倒挺有道理的
That actually makes a lot of sense.

1595
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:01,050
但是你不能等到你们俩都独处的时候
But you can't just wait for the two of you to be alone.

1596
01:23:01,220 --> 01:23:04,680
你得自己创造独处的机会
You have to make your own alone time.

1597
01:23:04,890 --> 01:23:08,560
你以为你为什么一周去三次希伯莱语学校
Why do you think you went to Hebrew school three times a week?

1598
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:10,910
每周日中午到下午三点
Sundays, noon to three?

1599
01:23:10,910 --> 01:23:12,730
每周二下午四点到七点
Tuesdays, four to seven?

1600
01:23:12,860 --> 01:23:14,150
我懂了  老爸
Okay, I get it, Dad.

1601
01:23:14,230 --> 01:23:16,440
如果你懂了  怎么还会出问题
If you get it, then why the questions?

1602
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:17,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

1603
01:23:17,780 --> 01:23:18,920
现在经历瓶颈的人是你  对不起
You're going through this, I am sorry.

1604
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:19,860
我应该好好听着的
I should be listening.

1605
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:23,030
没  是我反应过度了  是我的错
No, I'm overreacting. I'm sorry.

1606
01:23:26,870 --> 01:23:28,580
谢谢你
Thank you.

1607
01:23:29,120 --> 01:23:31,040
再次  真的
Again. Really.

1608
01:23:34,460 --> 01:23:35,710
欢迎随时咨询
Anytime.

1609
01:23:40,550 --> 01:23:42,140
欢迎各位
Welcome, you guys.

1610
01:23:42,220 --> 01:23:45,760
听着  找到你们的姓名牌  坐对位置
Listen, find your nametag, find out what table you're sitting at.

1611
01:23:45,850 --> 01:23:48,100
阿什丽  见到你真高兴  老天啊
Ashley, so good to see you! Oh, my God.

1612
01:23:48,270 --> 01:23:51,310
比利  老天啊  你看起来可真苗条
Billy! Oh, my God, you're looking so svelte.

1613
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,610
你以前可有点病态的肥  我还担心你呢
You used to be morbidly obese. I was concerned.

1614
01:23:55,860 --> 01:23:56,940
兄弟们
Hey, guys.

1615
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,690
-吉姆  -奥兹
- Hey, Jim. - Oz.

1616
01:23:58,990 --> 01:24:00,150
蜜儿在哪
Where is Mia?

1617
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:02,360
今早飞回去了
She flew out this morning.

1618
01:24:02,530 --> 01:24:04,870
真遗憾  伙计
I'm sorry, man.

1619
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,740
米雪怎么样
What about Michelle?

1620
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,870
还不太确定呢
I am not sure yet.

1621
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:11,870
芬治
Finch!

1622
01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:13,200
怎么回事
What happened?

1623
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:15,420
我给警局打了无数通电话了
I called the police department, like, a thousand times.

1624
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:20,380
谢谢了凯文  我妈已经保释我了
I appreciate that, Kevin. But my mom, actually, bailed me out.

1625
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:23,640
哥们  我搞砸了
Guys, I screwed up.

1626
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:25,890
那车是我老板的
That bike belongs to my boss.

1627
01:24:25,890 --> 01:24:27,620
他本来说给我涨工资的  后来反悔了
And I was promised a raise, and I didn't get it,

1628
01:24:27,620 --> 01:24:31,770
我就把他的车顺走了
so I simply borrowed it.

1629
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:35,060
其实我活的挺无聊的
The truth is that my life isn't interesting at all.

1630
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:38,200
就是个办公用品店的助理经理
I am an assistant manager at a Staples

1631
01:24:38,200 --> 01:24:39,570
在新泽西州巴荣纳市
in Bayonne, New Jersey.

1632
01:24:39,820 --> 01:24:43,030
你们是我最好的朋友  抱歉跟你们撒谎了
I lied to my best friends, and I'm sorry.

1633
01:24:44,450 --> 01:24:47,530
芬治  你为个无聊工作
You know, Finch, just because you sold out

1634
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:50,620
就把自己卖了  我们大家都差不多
and got a boring job like most of us,

1635
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,330
这没什么好尴尬的
that doesn't mean you should be embarrassed.

1636
01:24:52,420 --> 01:24:55,000
伙计  这都没什么
Hey, come on, man. None of that shit matters.

1637
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:57,340
这对我意义重大  先生们
That means a lot, gentlemen.

1638
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:58,880
你胳膊到底怎么回事
What about your arm?

1639
01:25:01,590 --> 01:25:04,340
开车时把咖啡洒胳膊上了
I spilled coffee on myself while I was driving.

1640
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:05,680
不是吧
No.

1641
01:25:06,430 --> 01:25:08,100
倒真是疼死哥了
It hurt like a bitch, though.

1642
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:11,060
那必须的  天哪  芬治
I'll bet. Jesus, Finch.

1643
01:25:11,430 --> 01:25:13,850
你们几个  看看这个
Hey, check this out, you guys.

1644
01:25:15,190 --> 01:25:17,270
那会玩的可够疯的  看看我们
Crazy, huh? Look at us.

1645
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,610
全是回忆
A lot of memories.

1646
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:22,240
史蒂夫?硬条
"Steve Stifler."

1647
01:25:23,200 --> 01:25:26,120
希望能和兄弟们一直派对下去
"Hopes to keep the party going with his boys."

1648
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,830
有人看到他了吗
Any sign of him yet?

1649
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,710
我觉得他不会主动出现的
I don't think he's going to show.

1650
01:25:49,260 --> 01:25:50,470
硬条
Stifler?

1651
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,640
你们怎么找到我的
How'd you find me?

1652
01:25:55,810 --> 01:25:57,150
我们问了你妈
We asked your mom.

1653
01:25:57,980 --> 01:26:00,480
没  这次我可啥都没干
No. I didn't do anything.

1654
01:26:01,820 --> 01:26:06,570
我们是来道歉的  昨晚跟你说的话
We wanted to apologize for what we said last night.

1655
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:08,160
我们不是故意的
We didn't mean it.

1656
01:26:09,580 --> 01:26:11,500
怎么不是  我知道了
Yeah, you did. I get it,

1657
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:13,500
你们觉得我就是个二逼
you guys think I'm a dick.

1658
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:20,460
是  好吧
Okay. Well.

1659
01:26:21,340 --> 01:26:23,760
你大概是有点二逼
Maybe you are kind of a dick.

1660
01:26:24,670 --> 01:26:25,760
但是
But,

1661
01:26:26,760 --> 01:26:28,510
你逗的一逼
you're a fun dick.

1662
01:26:28,680 --> 01:26:31,720
你正是我们的硬条啊
And you're our dick.

1663
01:26:32,350 --> 01:26:35,080
是啊伙计  要不是你
Yeah, man. You were like one of the biggest reasons

1664
01:26:35,080 --> 01:26:37,190
高中得无聊死
that high school was awesome.

1665
01:26:37,350 --> 01:26:40,020
是啊  高中过的确实棒极了
Yeah, high school was awesome.

1666
01:26:40,190 --> 01:26:42,980
然后大家就都毕业了  工作了
Then we graduated and everybody started getting jobs

1667
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:45,360
结婚  生孩子
and getting married and having kids

1668
01:26:45,450 --> 01:26:47,820
乱七八糟的破事
and all that other stupid shit.

1669
01:26:47,990 --> 01:26:51,660
再看我  我倒显得白痴了
Now, look at me. I'm the bitch of this place.

1670
01:26:51,870 --> 01:26:53,830
听着  硬条  家家有本难念的经
Look, Stifler, none of our lives are perfect.

1671
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:55,200
我的最难念
Especially mine.

1672
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,090
但我们不如继续派对下去
But what do you say we keep this party going,

1673
01:26:58,090 --> 01:27:00,540
一起搞次开心的同学会如何
and hit up this reunion together?

1674
01:27:02,380 --> 01:27:04,340
这里到底怎么回事
What the hell is going on here?

1675
01:27:05,090 --> 01:27:08,590
天哪  看看这白痴
Oh, my God. This is the jackass.

1676
01:27:09,010 --> 01:27:11,470
活堆的山高  你还在这里干什么
You're not even close to being finished and you're up here

1677
01:27:11,550 --> 01:27:13,680
和你的小团伙耍酷吗
"Chilling with your posse"?

1678
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:15,020
抱歉  我们能解释
Sorry, we can explain.

1679
01:27:15,180 --> 01:27:16,480
不用了  凯文
No, Kevin.

1680
01:27:17,890 --> 01:27:18,980
让我来
Allow me.

1681
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:21,690
对啊  凯文  让他来
Yeah, Kevin, allow him.

1682
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:22,980
你最好解释清楚  殃条
This better be good, Stafler.

1683
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,530
我叫硬条  傻逼
It's Stifler, fucker.

1684
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:29,820
你算老几啊
Who the hell do you think you are?

1685
01:27:30,030 --> 01:27:33,530
得在马子面前装牛逼是吧
Are you acting tough in front of your girlfriend?

1686
01:27:33,620 --> 01:27:35,620
咱俩都知道  她就是图你的钱罢了
Because we both know she's only with you for your money.

1687
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:37,790
难不成还图你的老二吗
Definitely not for your dick.

1688
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,790
跟你上过厕所的  都印象深刻啊
Because anybody that's peed next to you

1689
01:27:39,870 --> 01:27:41,710
三寸金莲都不到啊
knows it's the size of a leprechaun's pinkie.

1690
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:45,300
你胡扯
That's not true.

1691
01:27:45,380 --> 01:27:48,670
你胡扯  我可没胡扯
"That's not true." Oh, yeah, it is.

1692
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:53,020
听着  别以为你办公室漂亮
Look, just because you got a fancy office

1693
01:27:53,020 --> 01:27:54,050
就能来鄙视我
and I don't even have a desk

1694
01:27:54,220 --> 01:27:56,520
谁是二逼谁心里清楚
doesn't change who we really are.

1695
01:27:56,680 --> 01:28:00,190
事实是  你就是个傻逼
The truth is, you're still a dork,

1696
01:28:00,350 --> 01:28:02,310
哥要玩死你  那是小菜一碟
and I can still kick your ass.

1697
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:04,860
但我让着你
But I'm not going to.

1698
01:28:05,020 --> 01:28:06,570
知道为啥吗
You know why?

1699
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:08,860
因为我可是大屌硬条
Because I'm the fucking Stifmeister.

1700
01:28:08,870 --> 01:28:10,820
你再敢跟我吹胡子瞪眼睛的
And if you even look at me again,

1701
01:28:10,820 --> 01:28:12,950
哥就拉泡屎在你公文包里
I will shit in your briefcase.

1702
01:28:14,240 --> 01:28:15,410
伙计们
Dudes?

1703
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,670
还有  我一早上什么都没干
By the way, I had no clue what I was doing with any of this shit,

1704
01:28:25,840 --> 01:28:28,130
所以你有的干了
so you got a lot of work to do.

1705
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:37,030
酒后之言  就让我们抛却脑后吧
Can we forget about the things I said when I was drunk

1706
01:28:37,030 --> 01:28:40,730
那样无礼  并非我本意
I didn't mean to call you that

1707
01:28:41,730 --> 01:28:46,330
记不得你说了什么  记不得你的怒火
I can't remember what was said or what you threw at me

1708
01:28:46,330 --> 01:28:48,200
请告诉我
Please tell me

1709
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:52,330
请告诉我为何
please tell me why

1710
01:28:53,900 --> 01:28:56,830
为何我的车  在你的前院
My car is on the front yard

1711
01:28:56,830 --> 01:29:02,530
为何我穿戴整齐的在床上醒来
And I am sleeping with my cloths on

1712
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:04,540
-惊喜  -你来了
- Surprise! - Hey! You made it.

1713
01:29:04,710 --> 01:29:05,960
当然了
Of course.

1714
01:29:06,130 --> 01:29:07,990
你觉得今年底特律雄狮队怎么样
So what do you think about the Lions this year?

1715
01:29:07,990 --> 01:29:08,590
能希望吗
They got a shot?

1716
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:10,920
那得看他们的进攻线如何了
We'll see if their offensive line can hold.

1717
01:29:11,090 --> 01:29:13,760
你打算加入热舞明星全明星阵容吗
Are you planning on being on Celebrity Dance Off: All Stars?

1718
01:29:13,930 --> 01:29:15,800
我其实还没严肃考虑这事
I actually haven't thought much about that.

1719
01:29:15,970 --> 01:29:18,010
你该考虑考虑了
You should think about it.

1720
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:25,980
抱歉  各位  我得走开一下
I'm sorry, guys, you'll have to excuse me.

1721
01:29:30,610 --> 01:29:31,900
能打扰一下吗
Can I cut in?

1722
01:29:32,490 --> 01:29:35,110
不知道啊  保证不脱衣服不
I don't know. Can you promise to keep your shirt on?

1723
01:29:35,950 --> 01:29:38,740
拜托  伙计  就是开个玩笑
Come on, buddy, I'm busting balls.

1724
01:29:38,830 --> 01:29:40,910
当然可以
Yeah, of course.

1725
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:42,580
我去拿点喝的
I'll get us some drinks.

1726
01:29:42,660 --> 01:29:43,790
好
Okay.

1727
01:29:49,170 --> 01:29:51,460
怎么不去跟你女朋友跳舞
Shouldn't you be dancing with your girlfriend?

1728
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:56,970
我和蜜儿  已经分开了
Mia and I are over.

1729
01:29:58,470 --> 01:30:03,140
她希望我变成另一个人
She wanted me to be someone else.

1730
01:30:03,690 --> 01:30:07,350
变成一个我不喜欢的人
Something that I don't want to be.

1731
01:30:08,480 --> 01:30:10,650
那你想要什么  克里斯
What do you want, Chris?

1732
01:30:11,150 --> 01:30:13,490
海瑟  我想要现在这样
Heather, I want this.

1733
01:30:13,900 --> 01:30:15,200
你和我在一起
I want us.

1734
01:30:16,660 --> 01:30:20,160
那你的职业生涯怎么办  洛杉矶
What about your career? LA?

1735
01:30:20,330 --> 01:30:23,620
我知道这挺不现实的
Look, I know that it's crazy.

1736
01:30:23,790 --> 01:30:27,240
现在我也不知道下一步该做什么
And I don't have all the answers right now,

1737
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:31,380
但我看到你  我就觉得
but I see you, and I just know

1738
01:30:32,030 --> 01:30:36,570
我想和你在一起  我爱你
I want you. I love you.

1739
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:39,980
我也爱你
I love you.

1740
01:30:46,020 --> 01:30:47,100
当时我正从雪山上滑下来
So, I'm skiing down a mountain.

1741
01:30:47,190 --> 01:30:48,520
就看到那男的犯心脏病了
Guy has a heart attack right there.

1742
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:51,570
救了他一命  大事  能谷歌出来的
Saved his life. It was a big story, you can Google it.

1743
01:30:51,730 --> 01:30:52,860
是真的
Yeah, it was.

1744
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:54,360
可不是
I bet.

1745
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,530
见鬼  不好意思
Holy shit! Excuse me.

1746
01:30:57,700 --> 01:31:00,120
等等  这是什么状况
Hey, excuse me. What the hell is going on?

1747
01:31:00,530 --> 01:31:01,660
朗  听我解释
Ron, I can explain.

1748
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,000
开什么玩笑  就他
Seriously, this guy?

1749
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,200
我可是个心外科医生
I'm a fucking heart surgeon,

1750
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,540
这家伙连ESPN都没上过
this guy's not even on ESPN.

1751
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:07,500
淡定点  朗
Hey, take it easy, Ron.

1752
01:31:07,670 --> 01:31:10,000
你能干什么  打我吗  奥兹
What are you going to do? Hit me, Oz?

1753
01:31:10,170 --> 01:31:13,090
要不这样  你干嘛不给我们热舞一段
Oh, I got an idea. What about a dance-off?

1754
01:31:14,050 --> 01:31:16,880
这可不是什么真人秀  这是现实生活
This isn't a reality show, okay? This is the real world.

1755
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:20,390
你跟我耍花招  我告你倾家荡产
You take one swing at me, I will sue you for all you're worth.

1756
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:27,350
我可是一钱不值  傻逼
I'm not worth jack shit, Dron.

1757
01:31:29,940 --> 01:31:31,150
哥罩你
I'm your dick.

1758
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,190
轻松搞定啊
Dropped him!

1759
01:31:35,280 --> 01:31:36,280
帅呆了
That was awesome!

1760
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,610
听好  我们几天前的晚上突然想到件事
Listen, we had a blast the other night.

1761
01:31:39,780 --> 01:31:42,240
你想过做派对策划吗
Have you ever thought about being a party planner?

1762
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:45,200
我们想让你给我们策划婚礼
Because we want you to plan our wedding.

1763
01:31:45,290 --> 01:31:46,830
答应吧
Say yes.

1764
01:31:47,830 --> 01:31:49,790
好啊  好  非常乐意
Yeah, yeah! I'd love to.

1765
01:31:49,870 --> 01:31:51,670
太好了  天哪
Nice! Oh, my God.

1766
01:31:51,830 --> 01:31:53,540
谢谢  伙计你太棒了
Thanks! This is great, man.

1767
01:31:53,710 --> 01:31:56,340
太感谢了  哥们
Thank you so much. Thank you, bro.

1768
01:31:56,510 --> 01:31:57,960
-没啥  -谢谢
- You're welcome. - Thank you.

1769
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,850
我得跟你说件事
I have to tell you something.

1770
01:32:04,930 --> 01:32:06,060
不用解释
You don't have to explain.

1771
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,080
听着  保罗  我喜欢你
Look, Paul, I didn't like you

1772
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,980
不是因为你爬了阿尔卑斯山
because you climbed the Alps,

1773
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:13,150
或者徒手杀了匹骆驼什么的
or killed a camel with your bare hands.

1774
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,980
我喜欢你  是因为你还和高中一样
I liked you because you were still the same good guy

1775
01:32:16,070 --> 01:32:18,320
是真心对我好
that was actually nice to me in high school.

1776
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:20,200
我现在也还是
I'm still that guy.

1777
01:32:20,610 --> 01:32:22,320
真的
I really am.

1778
01:32:23,070 --> 01:32:25,780
上次我来这里  还是毕业舞会
You know, the last time I was here was for prom.

1779
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:28,330
连舞伴都没有
I didn't have a date.

1780
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:29,660
我也没有
Neither did I.

1781
01:32:32,330 --> 01:32:33,460
我得去喝一杯
I gotta get a drink.

1782
01:32:33,580 --> 01:32:35,090
什么
What?

1783
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:36,290
我跳的有那么差吗
Was my dancing that bad?

1784
01:32:36,380 --> 01:32:37,420
是
Yeah.

1785
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:39,510
凯文  你好啊
Kev! Hey!

1786
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:40,590
你好  杰西
Hey, Jess!

1787
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:42,470
你都有络腮胡了  挺好看的
Look, you have a beard! It looks great.

1788
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:44,510
-是吗 谢谢  -开个玩笑
- Thanks. - I'm kidding.

1789
01:32:44,640 --> 01:32:47,010
我们就先说了吧
Let's just get this out of the way.

1790
01:32:47,180 --> 01:32:50,430
我是同性恋了  这是我女朋友英格丽
I'm a lesbian now, and this is my girlfriend. This is Ingrid.

1791
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,310
-很高兴见到你  -我也是
- Good to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too.

1792
01:32:52,480 --> 01:32:55,150
拉拉  我就知道
Lesbians? I knew it!

1793
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,020
你俩还不亲一个  证明一下
Why don't you guys make out and prove it.

1794
01:32:57,190 --> 01:33:00,280
你一定就是硬条了  早有耳闻啊
You must be Stifler. I've heard a lot about you.

1795
01:33:00,360 --> 01:33:01,820
没听到什么好话
Mostly negative.

1796
01:33:02,030 --> 01:33:04,110
不错  伙计  搞毛啊
Cool, dude. What the fuck?

1797
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,030
杰西卡  见到你很高兴
Jessica, it's good to see you.

1798
01:33:06,160 --> 01:33:07,280
高兴才怪
No, it wasn't.

1799
01:33:07,370 --> 01:33:08,490
什么狗屁状况
What the...

1800
01:33:08,950 --> 01:33:11,710
凯文  你该去和碧琪谈谈
Look, Kev, I think you should go talk to Vicky.

1801
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:14,040
她在那里郁闷好久了
She's really upset over there.

1802
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,960
是  谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

1803
01:33:17,040 --> 01:33:18,420
很高兴见到你
Nice to meet you.

1804
01:33:18,500 --> 01:33:20,710
男人点  你都有胡子了
Be a real man, you have a beard now.

1805
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,640
凯文  别这样  我没事
Kevin, don't. I'm fine.

1806
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:30,390
拜托  我昨天完全是个蠢货
Come on. I was a complete jerk last night.

1807
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,440
我伤心是因为你居然那么想我
I was just upset that you would think that I would do that

1808
01:33:33,600 --> 01:33:35,230
我都知道你结婚了
knowing that you're married.

1809
01:33:35,770 --> 01:33:37,440
我知道你不会
I know you wouldn't.

1810
01:33:37,610 --> 01:33:41,190
真的  其实更多的是我紧张了
Honestly, that was more about me being nervous.

1811
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,360
又看到你  又想起以前的事什么的
Seeing you again, all these old feelings came up, and...

1812
01:33:46,530 --> 01:33:49,240
不知道怎么说  大概就是有点愧疚
I don't know, I guess I just felt guilty.

1813
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:54,290
但我现在还对你有感觉
But the fact that I still have feelings for you

1814
01:33:54,460 --> 01:33:57,210
这不正说明我原来是认真的  不是吗
just means that what we had was special.

1815
01:33:57,380 --> 01:33:59,250
别误会我
Don't get me wrong, all right.

1816
01:33:59,420 --> 01:34:02,710
我很爱艾丽
I love Ellie more than anything.

1817
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:05,380
但不管多少年过去
But no matter how much time passes

1818
01:34:06,140 --> 01:34:08,090
你永远是我的初恋
you'll always be my first love.

1819
01:34:11,140 --> 01:34:12,270
你也永远是我的初恋
And you'll always be mine.

1820
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:13,980
-凯文  -你好啊
- Kev. - Hey.

1821
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:16,100
尝尝这个小蛋糕  特别棒
You have to try these cupcakes, they're awesome.

1822
01:34:16,190 --> 01:34:18,310
艾丽  这是碧琪
Ellie, this is Vicky.

1823
01:34:18,560 --> 01:34:22,820
天哪  那个碧琪吗  凯文总跟我讲你
Oh, my God! The Vicky? Kevin has told me so much about you.

1824
01:34:22,940 --> 01:34:25,950
他是个好男人  你能有他真幸运
You're a really lucky girl. He's a great guy.

1825
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:28,910
-来和我们跳舞吧  -不  不用了
- Come dance with us. - No, it's okay.

1826
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:40,830
责任不全在我
I can't be held responsible

1827
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:44,830
只因她轻触脸颊
'Cause she was touching her face

1828
01:34:45,980 --> 01:34:49,830
责任不全在我
I won't be held responsible

1829
01:34:49,830 --> 01:34:54,000
是她先于我  坠入爱河
She fell in love in the first place

1830
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:58,830
无论如何  我无法记得
For the life of me I cannot remember

1831
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:04,030
当年为何  自作聪明  永不屈服
What made us think that we were wise and we'd never compromise

1832
01:35:04,030 --> 01:35:10,730
无论如何  我无法相信  我们罪已至死
For the life of me I cannot believe we'd ever die for these sins

1833
01:35:10,730 --> 01:35:11,490
我们只是初出茅庐
We were merely freshmen

1834
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:14,580
你好
Hey.

1835
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,120
我是吉姆
My name's Jim.

1836
01:35:20,080 --> 01:35:23,250
我们一起上的李老师的英语课
We were in Mr. Lee's English class together.

1837
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:24,550
真的吗
Really?

1838
01:35:25,340 --> 01:35:29,510
是啊  我  抱歉  真的不记得你
Yeah, I... Sorry, I don't remember you.

1839
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:30,840
好吧
Okay.

1840
01:35:32,050 --> 01:35:35,560
我就是大家在网上围观的那个
I was the kid who everyone saw on the internet.

1841
01:35:37,020 --> 01:35:40,230
抱歉  还得再具体点
Sorry, you're going to have to be more specific.

1842
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,060
我早泄了两次
I pre-ejaculated twice.

1843
01:35:42,190 --> 01:35:43,690
-你是吉姆?莱文斯汀  -莱文斯汀
- Oh, Jim Levenstein! - Levenstein

1844
01:35:43,770 --> 01:35:46,230
-对的  -对  吉姆?莱文斯汀
- Right! - Yeah, Jim Levenstein.

1845
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,900
想起来了
Now I remember. Yeah.

1846
01:35:49,780 --> 01:35:52,200
高中之后过得怎样
So, how have you been since high school?

1847
01:35:52,580 --> 01:35:55,870
挺好的  挺好的  我想想
Pretty good. Yeah, pretty good. Let's see.

1848
01:36:00,880 --> 01:36:03,380
我娶了世上最棒的老婆
I married the most wonderful woman in the world.

1849
01:36:05,670 --> 01:36:07,380
生了个世上最可爱的宝宝
And we have the cutest kid ever.

1850
01:36:08,760 --> 01:36:11,890
听起来挺完美的
You know what. It sounds like things are perfect.

1851
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:15,560
我愿意尽我所能让它变得完美
I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make it perfect.

1852
01:36:16,810 --> 01:36:20,980
当然也包括做世上最性感的老公
And that means being the sexiest husband possible.

1853
01:36:21,900 --> 01:36:23,020
真的吗
Really?

1854
01:36:23,770 --> 01:36:25,110
米雪  你今天真美
Michelle, you look beautiful.

1855
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,940
谢谢
Oh, thanks.

1856
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:30,650
想与我共舞一曲吗
Would you like to dance?

1857
01:36:31,240 --> 01:36:32,530
荣幸之极
I'd love to.

1858
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:55,090
硬条
Stifler.

1859
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:57,930
卓文  卓结者
Sherman? The Sherminator?

1860
01:36:58,470 --> 01:37:00,230
你他妈都干什么去了
What the fuck have you been up to?

1861
01:37:00,390 --> 01:37:02,730
结婚  生了一个孩子
Married. Had a kid.

1862
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:04,600
然后离婚了
And divorced.

1863
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:07,570
天哪  真不幸
Oh! I'm sorry.

1864
01:37:07,730 --> 01:37:08,900
是挺不幸的
Yeah, I'm sure you are.

1865
01:37:08,980 --> 01:37:12,870
也还好  至少我还有小弗朗
But, you know what, at least I got to keep little Furlong.

1866
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,320
你用爱德华·弗朗命名你的孩子
You named your kid after Eddie Furlong?

1867
01:37:15,740 --> 01:37:17,080
是  知道为什么吗
Yes, I did. You know why?

1868
01:37:17,240 --> 01:37:20,250
因为终结者二仍是有史以来最棒的电影
Because Terminator 2 is still the greatest film ever made.

1869
01:37:20,910 --> 01:37:24,420
伙计  你严重需要来一炮
Dude, you need to get banged bad.

1870
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:26,210
我要帮帮你
I'm gonna help you out.

1871
01:37:26,290 --> 01:37:28,750
你爽过了可以回头再谢我  怎么样
Your cock can thank me later, what do you say?

1872
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:31,920
不用了  我可不打算再上你的当了
No, no. See, I'm not gonna fall for that again.

1873
01:37:32,220 --> 01:37:33,680
拜托
Come on.

1874
01:37:33,760 --> 01:37:36,010
高中那会  我是挺操蛋的
I know I was bit of a jerk back in the day,

1875
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,890
但我已经成熟很多了
but I've grown up a lot since then.

1876
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,520
求你了  让我帮帮你
Please, let me help you out.

1877
01:37:45,810 --> 01:37:47,270
上当咯
Psyche!

1878
01:37:48,860 --> 01:37:50,360
就是跟你开玩笑呢
I'm just messing with you.

1879
01:37:50,440 --> 01:37:52,190
来抱一个  你个小流氓
Get over here, you little rascal.

1880
01:37:53,070 --> 01:37:55,610
我们来给你找个妞  走
Hey, let's find you some puss-puss. Let's go.

1881
01:38:00,830 --> 01:38:02,830
我们不能再待下去了
Okay, we have to get out of here.

1882
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:04,960
-总算  -对
- It's about time. - Yeah.

1883
01:38:09,710 --> 01:38:10,920
没什么希望的
It's a lost cause.

1884
01:38:11,010 --> 01:38:13,800
女的要么结婚了  要么有对象了
All these women are either married or came with dates.

1885
01:38:15,180 --> 01:38:16,220
你好  萝妮
Hey, Loni.

1886
01:38:16,300 --> 01:38:19,760
伙计  想不想颠覆下世界观
Dude, how would you like to have your world blown?

1887
01:38:31,070 --> 01:38:33,530
后会有期  硬条
Hasta la vista, Stifler.

1888
01:38:38,700 --> 01:38:42,370
好了  就剩我一个没女人上
Great, everybody's getting laid but me.

1889
01:38:42,540 --> 01:38:43,830
真倒霉
This sucks.

1890
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,830
不好意思
Excuse me.

1891
01:38:48,000 --> 01:38:51,040
我想找保罗?芬治  你看到过他吗
I'm looking for Paul Finch. Have you seen him anywhere?

1892
01:38:51,210 --> 01:38:52,920
你找芬治干什么
What do you want with Finch?

1893
01:38:53,090 --> 01:38:56,170
接他回家  他是我儿子
I'm here to pick him up. I'm his mom.

1894
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:00,930
芬治还有个妈
Finch has a mom?

1895
01:39:03,220 --> 01:39:06,230
不对  我是说  你是芬治的妈妈
I mean, you're Finch's mom?

1896
01:39:07,060 --> 01:39:09,400
是  你是他朋友吗
Yeah. Are you a friend of his?

1897
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:10,690
是啊
Oh, yeah.

1898
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:13,360
保罗可是我铁哥们
Paul is like my best friend.

1899
01:39:13,530 --> 01:39:17,740
我爱死他了  现在更爱了
I love him so much. More now than ever before.

1900
01:39:17,910 --> 01:39:21,280
我们怎么从没见过  我是史蒂夫?硬条
In fact, I can't believe we haven't met. I'm Steven Stifler.

1901
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,330
我是瑞秋
I'm Rachel.

1902
01:39:27,210 --> 01:39:29,210
什么  怎么了
What? What is it?

1903
01:39:29,380 --> 01:39:30,640
就是感觉有点诡异
I just got this feeling

1904
01:39:30,650 --> 01:39:33,130
好像要坏事
like something really bad is about to happen.

1905
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:38,220
别担心  我会像教堂里的老鼠一样安静的
Don't worry. I'll be as quiet as a church mouse.

1906
01:39:42,760 --> 01:39:43,850
吉姆
Jim!

1907
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:52,360
我太想要你了
I want you so bad.

1908
01:39:52,440 --> 01:39:54,110
你不知道我也有多想
Oh, you have no idea!

1909
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:56,990
天哪
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1910
01:39:57,150 --> 01:40:00,700
天哪  就这样  我快不行了
Oh, God, there it is. I don't think I can hold it anymore.

1911
01:40:00,780 --> 01:40:01,780
再坚持会
Hold it in!

1912
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:03,910
抱歉  会的
I'm sorry, I will.

1913
01:40:04,030 --> 01:40:05,240
我都忘了这有多爽了
I just forgot how awesome this is.

1914
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:07,500
天哪  就是这样
Oh, yeah, I need this.

1915
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:13,000
老天爷  米雪  我爱死你了
Oh, God, Michelle! Fuck, I love you!

1916
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,290
吉姆
Jim?

1917
01:40:16,420 --> 01:40:17,420
娜迪亚
Nadia?

1918
01:40:21,680 --> 01:40:24,850
抱歉  你俩忙着呢  是吧
I'm sorry. You are busy, yes?

1919
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:26,760
-没有  -是
- No. - Yes.

1920
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:28,020
是  是
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1921
01:40:28,680 --> 01:40:31,690
娜迪亚  见到你很高兴
Nadia, it's so nice to see you,

1922
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:34,730
但那个  能给我们一分钟吗
but do you think you could give us a minute?

1923
01:40:34,900 --> 01:40:35,860
三
Three.

1924
01:40:35,940 --> 01:40:36,940
三分钟
Three minutes.

1925
01:40:37,110 --> 01:40:40,740
好  看你俩相亲相爱的真好
Okay! So nice you are still together.

1926
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:44,280
我看你现在更驾轻就熟了嘛
And I see you've gotten much better at this.

1927
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:47,240
好吧  谢谢
Well, thanks.

1928
01:40:52,120 --> 01:40:54,670
那就是吉姆吗  长得一点不像我
That's Jim? He looks nothing like me.

1929
01:40:56,500 --> 01:41:01,630
高中的时候  我约过一个曲棍球队长
You know, when I was in high school, I dated a lacrosse player.

1930
01:41:01,880 --> 01:41:03,760
其实 不止一个
In fact, I dated a few of them.

1931
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:05,930
真没想到
You don't say.

1932
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:09,270
我总是希望  保罗能更喜欢体育
I always wanted Paul to be more into sports.

1933
01:41:09,430 --> 01:41:12,140
但他就是不怎么感兴趣
But he just was never that interested.

1934
01:41:12,640 --> 01:41:14,310
不用粉饰什么
You don't have to sugarcoat it.

1935
01:41:14,480 --> 01:41:15,810
芬治就是笨手笨脚的很
Finch was a klutz.

1936
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:21,240
是  我也觉得  但那可不是遗传我
Yeah, I guess he was, but he did not get that from me.

1937
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:24,320
我原来可是拉拉队长
I was head cheerleader.

1938
01:41:24,660 --> 01:41:27,660
要说我从曲棍球员身上学到了什么的话
And if there's anything I learned from lacrosse players,

1939
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:31,370
就是我喜欢玩棍棍
it's that I like to handle a stick

1940
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:35,580
和爱抚球球了
and cradle those balls.

1941
01:41:38,840 --> 01:41:40,050
我爱上你了
I love you.

1942
01:41:41,010 --> 01:41:43,300
准备好了吗  硬条
Are you ready for me, Stifler?

1943
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:49,010
必须的
Oh, yeah!

1944
01:41:50,600 --> 01:41:52,180
咱们走
Let's go.

1945
01:41:52,350 --> 01:41:54,270
米雪
Oh, Michelle.

1946
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:56,350
天哪  米雪
Oh, God, Michelle.

1947
01:41:56,940 --> 01:41:59,360
你太棒了
You are amazing!

1948
01:41:59,730 --> 01:42:01,190
比浴缸好吗
Better than the bathtub?

1949
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:02,320
好多了
Much.

1950
01:42:04,110 --> 01:42:05,740
比这个好
Better than this?

1951
01:42:10,620 --> 01:42:12,120
肯定的
Of course.

1952
01:42:13,620 --> 01:42:15,540
脱了这些
Oh, take those off!

1953
01:42:15,710 --> 01:42:17,000
我们不该这样
We shouldn't be doing this.

1954
01:42:17,170 --> 01:42:18,250
就该这样
Yes, we should.

1955
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:20,170
硬条
Oh, Stifler.

1956
01:42:20,340 --> 01:42:21,880
芬治他妈
Oh, Finch's mom!

1957
01:42:23,380 --> 01:42:24,720
叫我大屌硬条
Call me the Stifmeister!

1958
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,300
你就是大屌硬条
Yeah, you are the Stifmeister.

1959
01:42:28,800 --> 01:42:30,050
熟女
Milf?

1960
01:42:36,730 --> 01:42:38,310
芬治他妈
Oh, Finch's mom!

1961
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:39,610
熟女
Milf.

1962
01:42:41,190 --> 01:42:42,230
熟女
Milf.

1963
01:42:45,990 --> 01:42:47,320
说我最棒
Tell me I'm the best.

1964
01:42:47,410 --> 01:42:49,070
你就是最棒的
You are the best!

1965
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:50,950
熟女
Milf.

1966
01:42:52,200 --> 01:42:53,580
-熟女  -熟女
- Milf. - Milf.

1967
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:56,410
芬治他妈
Oh, Finch's mom!

1968
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:02,040
熟女  熟女  熟女

1969
01:43:04,420 --> 01:43:05,880
太爽了  就是这样
Yes! Yes!

1970
01:43:05,970 --> 01:43:07,380
你儿子太蠢了
Oh, your son's such a dork!

1971
01:43:07,470 --> 01:43:09,390
闭嘴  不许说他
Stop talking about him!

1972
01:43:11,810 --> 01:43:14,470
我们头一次同学会  就这么过去了
Well, our first reunion is officially in the books.

1973
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:17,850
我不知道你们怎样  我昨晚上结果可不错
I don't know about you guys, but my night ended pretty well.

1974
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,100
棒极了
It was great.

1975
01:43:19,190 --> 01:43:20,520
-昨晚上可是爽死了  -难忘啊
- I had a blast. - Unforgettable.

1976
01:43:20,610 --> 01:43:22,320
真的是  我射得跟水龙头一样
Fuck yeah! I jizzed like a racehorse.

1977
01:43:23,030 --> 01:43:24,690
你晚上干什么去了  硬条
What happened to you at the end of the night, Stifler?

1978
01:43:24,780 --> 01:43:26,070
最后和谁过的
Who did you end up with?

1979
01:43:26,150 --> 01:43:28,910
绅士从不透露私生活  吉姆
A gentleman never kisses and tells, Jim.

1980
01:43:31,780 --> 01:43:32,830
伙计们
Guys?

1981
01:43:34,910 --> 01:43:36,790
我一会就过去  好吧
I'll be right back, okay?

1982
01:43:40,710 --> 01:43:41,790
凯菈
Kara!

1983
01:43:51,220 --> 01:43:53,890
听着  那天的事  真的很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry about what I said the other night.

1984
01:43:54,060 --> 01:43:57,430
没事  是我该说抱歉
No, I'm the one who should be apologizing.

1985
01:43:57,600 --> 01:43:59,730
没想到我还会干出那种事  尴尬死了
I can't believe the way I acted. I'm so embarrassed.

1986
01:43:59,810 --> 01:44:01,350
别
Don't be.

1987
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:05,070
我像你这么大的时候  对性也挺着迷的
When I was your age I was pretty obsessed with sex, too.

1988
01:44:05,150 --> 01:44:06,230
我知道
I know.

1989
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,360
看到油拖把上那段视频了
I've seen the YouTube clip.

1990
01:44:08,860 --> 01:44:11,320
是  大家都看到了
Oh, of course you did.

1991
01:44:11,490 --> 01:44:13,700
但是  谢谢你能理解我
But, thanks for understanding.

1992
01:44:13,870 --> 01:44:16,660
我回去想了想  你说的对
I was thinking about it, and you're right.

1993
01:44:16,830 --> 01:44:18,450
我是该等那个特别的人
I should really wait for someone special.

1994
01:44:20,170 --> 01:44:23,170
只是  再找个像你这么好的男人  挺难的
Just, it's going to be tough to find a guy as good as you.

1995
01:44:26,590 --> 01:44:27,670
你肯定能找到的
Well, I'm sure you will.

1996
01:44:34,510 --> 01:44:36,600
这周末让我焕然一新啊
Well, I feel like a whole new man after this weekend.

1997
01:44:36,680 --> 01:44:38,140
不过要分别还是挺不爽的
Kind of sucks we have to leave, though.

1998
01:44:38,230 --> 01:44:41,350
我可不走了  我要休假
Not me. I'm going to take some time off my job

1999
01:44:41,440 --> 01:44:43,270
多和海瑟待会
and stick around here with Heather for a while.

2000
01:44:43,360 --> 01:44:44,440
不错嘛
Nice!

2001
01:44:44,520 --> 01:44:45,650
你呢  芬治
What about you, Finch?

2002
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:48,940
我和塞琳娜正打算去欧洲玩
Selena and I, we're planning a little jaunt to Europe.

2003
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:51,700
多和你妈联系联系  她挺想你的
Just make sure you call your mom. She misses you.

2004
01:44:52,570 --> 01:44:53,950
你怎么会知道
How would you know?

2005
01:44:59,870 --> 01:45:01,790
这就结束了  是吧  要回到现实了
I guess this is it, huh? Back to reality?

2006
01:45:01,960 --> 01:45:03,710
我们不该苦等下次同学会才见
We shouldn't wait until the next reunion.

2007
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:06,960
我们该每年都聚一次
We should try to get together every year.

2008
01:45:07,090 --> 01:45:09,710
你们怎么想  下次再见
What do you say, until next time?

2009
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:11,970
-下次再见  -下次再见
- Until next time. - Until next time!

2010
01:45:11,970 --> 01:45:15,000
他的床第燃烧着爱欲之火
His bed is on fire with passionate love

2011
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:18,000
邻居们抱怨着楼上的响动
The neighbours complain about the noises above

2012
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:21,690
要在上面她才带感
But she only comes when she's on top

2013
01:45:21,690 --> 01:45:22,980
我上了芬治他妈
I fucked Finch's mom.

2014
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:24,400
什么
What?

2015
01:45:24,520 --> 01:45:25,860
你刚说什么
What was that?

2016
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:30,960
心理医师让我不要再见你
My therapist said not to see you no more

2017
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:34,960
她说你像是不治之症
She said you're like a disease without any cure

2018
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:39,000
她说我痴迷于你  心已掏空
She said I'm so obsessed that I'm becoming a bore

2019
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,860
天啊
Oh no

2020
01:46:49,610 --> 01:46:50,980
这是怎么回事
What's this?

2021
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,070
天哪  亲爱的  别这样
Oh, no, dear. No, no, no.

2022
01:46:54,240 --> 01:46:56,070
宝贝  别
No, dear. No!

2023
01:47:11,840 --> 01:47:14,710
天哪
Oh, boy. Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

2024
01:47:14,920 --> 01:47:17,010
天哪
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

2025
01:47:19,340 --> 01:47:21,390
天哪
Oh, my God!

2026
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:37,100
