00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,161
I know, man.

148
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,673
Now, raise it up!

149
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,141
Give me somethin' sky high.

150
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,376
- Okay.
- I'm not thirsty.

151
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,441
Damn it!

152
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,283
They come in here
just about every night,

153
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,789
order a couple of
sloe gin fizzes.

154

<i>[Man #1] That's right.</i>

156
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,858
You don't remember any more
what they look like?

157
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,232
<i>[Man #1]</i>

remember my first name.

159
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,944
I hear that one,
old school.

160
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,846
All right.
I appreciate the help.

161
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,350
Get yourself
something imported.

162
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:55,492

Take your money.

164
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,100
All right.
Fine, pal.

165
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,762
Sam, I could eat
20 to 25 cocktail shrimp
in a single sitting,

166
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:09,240
and people are giving me
a quarter to a fifth
of my total shrimp capacity.

167
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,242
It is an insult.

168
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,278
See, that's interesting,
because I've always viewed
the appetizer...

169
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,906
as just sort of a teaser
to the main course.

170
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,678
No, I think it's different
when you're talkin'
about shrimp.

171
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,685
Shrimp aren't filling.
They're a snack food.

172
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,983
Hey, you guys talkin'
about shrimp?

173
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,989
Is that something
that you have a problem with?

174
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:29,517
No. No. No.
I just overheard your argument.
I thought it was a good one.

175
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,655
<i>See, check this out.</i>
<i>I go to a party,</i>
<i>right, with a raw bar.</i>

176
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,099
Now, I'm eatin' 30 shrimp,
maybe more,

177
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,227
dependin' how I'm feelin'
that particular day.

178
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,831
You know,
I'm dousing those fuckers
with the cocktail sauce too.

179
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:47,209
<i>Now, I go to a restaurant,</i>

180

[Laughing]

183
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,487
Okay. You convinced me,
I'm not ordering shrimp cocktail
anymore.

184
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,291
I could go get myself
a hand job for eight bucks.

all the little things in life
that really get to me.

193

shrimp cocktail rip off,

194
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,888

<i>The system is trying</i>

- What?

197
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,903
I fuck right back.
[Laughing]

Hey, what line of work
are you guys in?

199
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,208
Ooh. We're actually
in business for ourselves.
We have a—

<i>I don't think we really</i>
<i>have to get into that</i>

201
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,045
Oh. [Smacks Lips]
Hey, enough said.
All right.

202
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,620
Hey, let me get you guys
a couple of refreshers.

203
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,284
What are you
workin' on there, huh?
Sloe gin fizzes?

204
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,791
Sure, if you—
Yeah, we'll have
a couple of sloe gin fizzes.

205
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,801
I'll be right back.
Okay, two sloe gin fizzes
comin' up.

206
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,168
Ah, but that's
what I'm sayin'.

207
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:27,042
Carpe diem.
Take the bull
by the horns and twist.

208
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,241
- You're right.
- You think I'm gonna wait
for my ship to come in?

209
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:34,275
Bullshit!
I'm gonna sail out to sea
the first chance I get.

210
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,878
Really?
You don't seem like
the seafaring type to me.

211
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,915
- Meaning what?
- Meaning when
opportunity presents itself,

212
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,053
well, I'll bet
you pussy out
just like the rest of us.

Strong words,
teddy bear.

215
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,292
But, let me try to
talk to that there.

216
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,034
- You mind hearing
a little story?
- No, not at all.

217
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,577
<i>Good. 'Cause I think</i>
<i>you're gonna like this story.</i>

218
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,479
- What about me?
<i>- Everyone is gonna love this</i>
<i>story. This is a good story.</i>

219
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,677
<i>See, a couple of months ago</i>
<i>a buddy of mine,</i>

220
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:12,486
a male nurse,
he starts to work for this
old, eccentric type of guy.

221
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:17,359
<i>Now, one day, my guy is doing</i>
<i>some light dusting</i>
<i>around the basement,</i>

222
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,489
and he finds that
this old coot has a safe.

223
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,024
<i>Now, my buddy, he knows</i>
<i>that I am up for anything.</i>

224
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,199
So he says to me, "Hey, Chop,
why don't you break into
Pappy's?" All right?

225
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,266
They call him Pappy.
"Why don't you
break into Pappy's house...

226
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,334
<i>and see what he's got</i>
<i>in that little safe ofhis?"</i>

227
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,872
<i>So I break in the house, right?</i>
<i>About 6:00 in the p.m.,</i>

228
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,408
'cause Pappy goes to bed
at, like, I don't know,
4:00 in the afternoon.

229
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,685
I crack that safe,
which is as easy as
opening a can of Fresca,

230
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,023
<i>and gentlemen,</i>
<i>it is raining cash in there.</i>

231
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,257
Man, I'm talkin'—
l-I could make, like,

232
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:58,031
a six-foot hoagie sandwich
outta all the dough
that is sittin' in that safe.

233
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,630
I mean, this guy— this guy,
he's like one of these guys—
He saved up, like,

234
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,370
<i>90 years worth of paychecks</i>
<i>and they'rejust sittin'</i>
<i>in that little unit,</i>

<i>waitin'to be taken.</i>
<i>[Smacks Lips]</i>

236
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,416
Now, ya see,
the only problem is...

237
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,509
all I brought
for transportation is...

238
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,249
like, a little
backpack-type of thing.

239
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:22,090
But, now, if I'd had that
kind of valise—
[Chuckles]

240
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,188
Oh, gentlemen,
I would be a whole heck of a lot
richer than I am right now.

241
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,467
<i>By the time I get home,</i>
<i>I flip on</i> Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman,

242
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:38,408
and I'm holdin' $36,000 dollars
and Methuselah doesn't even know
he's missin' the dough.

243
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,638
Jesus Christ.

244
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,342
<i>You cracked this guy's safe</i>
<i>and you made $36,000 dollars?</i>

245
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,748
<i>You have to remember, right,</i>
<i>I'm gonna split it up</i>
<i>with my buddy, right?</i>

246
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,447
So, after tax time, yeah.

247
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,388
I'm lookin' at $21,600
in hot, hard cootchie-coo.

248
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,424
So, why don't you
go back for more?

249
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:05,198
Eduardo, here's the twist.
And you're not going to believe
this. Are you ready, Eddie?

250
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,901
All of the sudden my buddy
has to go out of town
for a family-type situation.

251

<i>Asks me if I'll look after Pappy</i>
<i>while he's gone, you know,</i>

00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,012
it's just a temporary
kind of thing.

253
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,709
You know, I figure,
look, I've done my share
of male nursing in the past,

254
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,719
<i>and it's the least</i>
<i>I can do for the old guy,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

255
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,278
Considering I just stole
40 grand of his

256
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,824
<i>[Laughs]</i>
<i>And I'm gonna take more...</i>

258
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,821

- Oh, I'm in. [Smacks Lips]
But I'm out.

259
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,531
<i>Apparently, gentlemen,</i>
<i>there's a phenomenon that</i>
<i>develops in male nurses</i>—

00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,972
it's called
Lawrence Nightingale Syndrome.

261
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:47,240
- I've heard of that.
- You haven't heard of that.

262
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,874
<i>Yeah, well see, what happens</i>
<i>is you become attached</i>
<i>to your patients...</i>

on an emotional level.

264
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,454
And that is

270
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,667
<i>Well, a lot of times,</i>

271
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,836
he'll just be lying there
in a-a—

272
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,779
in a puddle
of his own make.

273
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:27,114
I just kind of cradled him
and stuff, ya know.

274
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:32,283
- You couldn't
steal from Pappy?

that's where I'm at right now.

279

for another three weeks, right?

280
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,204
And I'm livin'

298
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,775
It's not his name.
It's a nickname.

299

Wait, you don't see
anything morally wrong...

I'm not trying to upset you,

You know why.

We're not thieves,
Eddie, we're singers.

308
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,096
And I like to think of Pappy
as a very generous
patron of the arts.

309

Hey, don't kid yourself. If we
do this thing, we are thieves.
We're not thieves.

What the fuck
is your real name,

325
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,038
It's Veal Chop.

326
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,440
Listen, Veal Chop, I think
I speak for Eddie here—
Hey, don't speak for me.

327
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,776
This is—This is clearly
a misunderstanding.

328
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,511
So I think you should probably
get Pappy out here.

329
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,952

I'm actually
not gonna let you go.

331

- My name is Bernie Gayle.
- You're Big Fat Bernie Gayle.

Mm. I really prefer
people not use the fat part.

00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,510
Okay.

340
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:27,582
The important thing
is you recognized me.

341
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,423
Well, there's not
too manyJewish gangsters
in Providence.

342
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,690
Oh, no.
There are a couple of us.

343

Look.
I could talk all night.

344
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,393
But I'd really like
to get in a steam bath
before dinner.

345
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,200
So, here's the thing
with this whole thing.

346
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,208
I think we can all agree
that there's no Pappy.

347
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,336
And, since there's no Pappy,
then this is clearly my home.

00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,007
- Are you not a male nurse?
- Sorry, son.

349

This is my home.
And you broke into it.

And, now, it's time
for a little payback.

But what are you—
what are you talking about?

353
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,190
You broke into my house
and tried to steal from me.

Because you cannot.

<i>- What's goin'on?</i>

431
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:26,184
This man is in the Mafia, Sam.
Do you understand that?

432
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,192
He's not gonna
let us off the hook...

433
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,696
because we send him
a fucking basket
of sundry goods.

434
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,697
He's in theJewish Mafia.

435
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,359
I'm sure that's
much more like a club
than an actual organization.

436
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,368
[Scoffs]
Let me explain somethin' here.

[Whispers] Which is why—
But you know
who can do stuff like that?

440
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,316
Tough guys.
Guys that Veal Chop
thought we were.

441
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,048
- [Clears Throat]
How much?
- [Whispers] Sixteen.

<i>Which is why</i>
<i>I think we should see...</i>

00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,815
how he responds
to the gift basket and then
play it out from there.

444
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,887
No. You're gonna
have to call him and tell him
that we can't do it.

445
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,332
Why can't you
just call your fucking father
and ask him for some help?

446
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,336
Don't turn this into a thing
about my father. All right?
I'm not.

447
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,100
I just don't see
why you can't call him.
Because it's just not an option.

448
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,665
Well, I don't feel comfortable
calling Bernie. So, it's going
to a Bernard Gayle.

449
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:22,873
Call him, Sam.
[Whispers] Don't!

Hi, Bernie. It's Samuel.
Who?

462
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,929
The safe guy from last night.
What is it?
I'm exercising.

463
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,562
Listen. Eddie and I
talked it over...

464
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,266
and we really think
that because
of the Pappy technicality...

and everything...

we're gonna kind of pass
on doin' the safe thing.

467
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:34,547
Samuel, I'm gonna
put you on hold
for a minute here.

468
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,644

And my last boyfriend
was a thief.

it'd be Farrah Fawcett,

768
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:38,599
Jaclyn Smith, and then
who's the one that replaced
Farrah, the first one?

769
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,134
Tanya Roberts.
Yeah, that's my pick.
Tanya Roberts.

770
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:47,377

I'd make love
to Farrah Fawcett first.

<i>He's working at a pants factory.</i>

873
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,971
He comes to me.
He's been manufacturing
slacks, all kinds,

874
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,410
uh, Sansabelts,
Chinos, whatnot.

<i>He swiped a carton</i>

877
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:32,044
I say, "Fine."
He says, "There is a catch."

878
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,249
Seems these slacks
had been discontinued.

879
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:38,226
The material they're made out of
has been found to be flammable.

880
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:41,526
The pants
are flammable?
<i>They were flammable.</i>

881
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,032
So who cares?
'Cause usually what that
means is that, uh,

882
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,035
it didn't pass
some government regulation,
something like that.

All of a sudden a lady comes in,
a regular customer of mine.

887
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,015
She comes in and she tries on
the slacks.

888
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:07,181
Now this lady has
what you call a...

889
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,521

<i>she buys a pair.</i>

894
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,738
Two weeks later she tells me
she's never felt better.

895
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,867
She's wearing those pants
three, four times a week.

896
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,935
I am so moved by her happiness
that I invite her here...

897
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,982

Joyce comes and she brings
a package of Kobe steaks
as a thank you.

903
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:52,232
She's wearing the pants.
And you know what?

904
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,738
- She looks great.
<i>- She looked really good.</i>

All right. Make fun.
Make all the fun you want,

906
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,968

this woman looks terrific.

907

another steak.

911
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,222
No, I tell her.
Joyce, I can't.
But the truth is...

912
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,317
that Kobe steak,
it cuts like butter.

913
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:20,124
I wouldn't mind
another piece of that beef.

914
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:23,030
So she insists.
She goes over and she
fires up the grill.

915
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,762
It's one of those grills,

to God I think to myself,

00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:00,166
I don't know, at that moment,

the pants.

Of course not.
