1
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,589
<i>Apart of me still believes</i>
<i>Eddie and I could have been...</i>

2
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:32,859
<i>one of the more popular</i>
<i>recording acts</i>
<i>of the mid-to-late '90s.</i>

3
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:36,959
<i>But it's clear to me now</i>
<i>that things happened the way</i>
<i>they did for a reason.</i>

4
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,029
<i>Sometimes</i>
<i>when a man is lost,</i>

5
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:42,870
<i>his situation needs to get</i>
<i>worse before it can get better.</i>

6
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:51,950
<i>My name is Samuel,</i>
<i>and this was my situation.</i>

7
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:55,146
Time?
<i>9:42.</i>

8
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:59,385
<i>Spin left five degrees.</i>
Spinning. Spinning.

9
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:01,552
<i>And back a revolution.</i>

10
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:04,256
Backing, backing.

11
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,355
It's so good
to be us.

12
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,401
'Cause we da men.

13
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:10,936
What?
We're the men.

14
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,606
We're good men
for this job.

15
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:22,180
It's us, baby.
It's all
about us.

16
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:25,706
We gonna get it on!
Yeah!
We're gonna turn
this mother out!

17
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,056
Time?
9:47.
Would you focus, please?

18
00:01:32,125 --> 00:01:34,059
I'm focusing.
Well, I'm focused.

19
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,061
Back off, Mitchell.

20
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,065
<i>You hungry?</i>
I'm starving.

21
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:44,069
<i>Me too.</i>
<i>I'm Hamlisch.</i>
What does that mean?

22
00:01:44,137 --> 00:01:46,503
I'm starvin'
like Marvin.

23
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:49,337
Hamlisch, the composer.
He wrote
"They're Playing Our Song."

24
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,707
Why don't you
make the call?
All right.

25
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,975
I'm gonna make the call.

26
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,017
Casa de Taco.
Thirty minutes or it's free.

27
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,287
<i>Okay. Philip will be ringing</i>
<i>your doorbell at exactly 10:17.</i>

28
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,018
Let's do this on my count.

29
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,253
In five, four,

30
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:10,922
three, to the two, one,
and synchronize.

31
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,795
<i>All right. We're locked</i>
<i>and loaded over here.</i>
<i>We'll see ya in 30.</i>

32
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:29,238
10:13, Frank.
Spinning,
spinning.

33
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:32,148
And let it rain.

34
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:39,057
You sick bitch!

35
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:42,219
Your head's up
in goddamn <i>Skylab.</i>
Now we're in a situation.

36
00:02:42,295 --> 00:02:45,389
This is not
a situation.
It's 10:14, Frank.

37
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:47,399
Get your eyes
on the prize.
It isn't
a situation.

38
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:49,731
F.Y.I. it is
a situation.

39
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:52,168
<i>What are you doing?</i>

40
00:02:54,107 --> 00:02:56,041
I'm going freestyle.

41
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,950
<i>All right!</i>

42
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:20,358
10:16:33.

43
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:23,334
Come on, honey.
Tell me something good.

44
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,753
16:38, Francis.

45
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,337
We're home.

46
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,896
Let's go get some tacos.

47
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:22,683
Sorry about that, kid.

48
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:35,060
You know what, Samuel?
That is what we've been doin'.

49
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:37,295
We've been
kidding ourselves.

50
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,998
Th-Th-That's not true,
Eddie.

51
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,541
Nobody cares.
Do you understand that?

52
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:45,406
I'm singing
my fucking heart out,

53
00:05:45,478 --> 00:05:47,412
<i>and the audience</i>
<i>is literally giving me nothing.</i>
Eddie.

54
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,439
Eddie, it is a Polish tradition
to show appreciation
through silence.

55
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,485
We're dealing with
a cultural difference.

56
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:55,953
Did you think this
was a positive career move?

57
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,354
Is that what's
going through your head?

58
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,392
At the time, it seemed like
a good chance...

59
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,553
for some exposure
in the international community.

60
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:04,562
What, the matching slacks
and sweaters?

61
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,564
They just kind of add
to our whole mystique,
right?

62
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,600
Yeah, they do, Eddie.
Yeah.

63
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,602
The people like to see
the outfits.

64
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,766
It shows that some thought
went into the act.
Some preparation.

65
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:17,605
There's a look
that people get
when they're seeing something...

66
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:21,306
they've never
seen before.

67
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:25,442
We rocked
these fucking Polish tonight.

68
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:28,919
We frea-We freaked
these people out.

69
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:33,550
<i>This lodge knew that they were</i>
<i>seeing the Simon and Garfunkel</i>
<i>for the millennium.</i>

70
00:06:33,626 --> 00:06:35,560
They had the look.

71
00:06:35,628 --> 00:06:37,960
<i>But you know what,</i>
<i>Sam?</i>

72
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,056
Arthur Garfunkel
knew the words to his songs.

73
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:44,968
Okay, Sam?
Garfunkel knew the words.

74
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,109
I'm going through
a minor lyric situation
right now.

75
00:06:56,182 --> 00:06:59,982
It doesn't go any deeper
than that.

76
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:08,425
<i>Yes, it does, Sam.</i>
<i>We are a two-person group,</i>

77
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,554
- and one of us
doesn't know the lyrics.
- I know the words.

78
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,963
- I know the words, Eddie.
- Show me.

79
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:16,866
- What?
- Dire Straits'
"Walk of Life."

80
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,496
<i>Prove me wrong.</i>

81
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:22,973
"Walk of Life."
You want me to sing
"Walk of Life."

82
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:57,671
Those aren't
the words.
No, they're not
the words, Eddie.

83
00:07:57,743 --> 00:08:00,177
They're not even
close to them.
No, they're
different words.

84
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:06,014
You know, five years
is such a long time to go
without some kind of reward.

85
00:08:06,085 --> 00:08:09,714
It's a long fucking time.

86
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,416
Thank you.
He's not talking to you.

87
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,622
<i>Tough safe.</i>
<i>I wanna carry the bag.</i>

88
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:20,689
You cannot carry the bag.
But you said it was heavy
and I asked you to carry it.

89
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:22,700
Let me tell you something.
You watch me,
What?

90
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,100
one day you're gonna be
ready to carry the bag, okay?

91
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,366
All right.

92
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,374
What are you doin'?

93
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:34,042
Uh, breakin' tradition.
You can't
break tradition.

94
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,946
Look, man.
I'm not in the mood
for a sloe gin fizz.

95
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:39,314
If you want one,
go and get it yourself.

96
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,047
I'm going to look like
a fucking asshole if I go
into this bar alone...

97
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,055
and order myself
a sloe gin fizz.

98
00:08:44,123 --> 00:08:48,059
I know it's breaking tradition,
but I don't feel like I can go
through with it tonight.

99
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:52,356
She's not gonna take you back,
all right. Move on.

100
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,264
- But Hannah's the only one
that I care about.
- There are a ton of ladies...

101
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:57,598
in this town dying
to get into your trap.

102
00:08:57,670 --> 00:09:00,161
I know, man.

103
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:02,673
Now, raise it up!

104
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:07,141
Give me somethin' sky high.

105
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,376
- Okay.
- I'm not thirsty.

106
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,441
Damn it!

107
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,283
They come in here
just about every night,

108
00:09:16,355 --> 00:09:18,789
order a couple of
sloe gin fizzes.

109
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:22,123
<i>Always carryin'</i>
<i>a duffle-type of bag, huh?</i>

110
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:24,219
<i>That's right.</i>

111
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:27,858
You don't remember any more
what they look like?

112
00:09:27,934 --> 00:09:30,232
<i>In my condition, friend,</i>

113
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:33,739
some days, I can hardly
remember my first name.

114
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,944
I hear that one,
old school.

115
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:43,846
All right.
I appreciate the help.

116
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:46,350
Get yourself
something imported.

117
00:09:50,623 --> 00:09:55,492
<i>Put that dime</i>
<i>towards a decent haircut,</i>
<i>thick man.</i>

118
00:09:55,561 --> 00:09:57,586
Take your money.

119
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:02,100
All right.
Fine, pal.

120
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:04,762
Sam, I could eat
20 to 25 cocktail shrimp
in a single sitting,

121
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:09,240
and people are giving me
a quarter to a fifth
of my total shrimp capacity.

122
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,242
It is an insult.

123
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,278
See, that's interesting,
because I've always viewed
the appetizer...

124
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:15,906
as just sort of a teaser
to the main course.

125
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:18,678
No, I think it's different
when you're talkin'
about shrimp.

126
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,685
Shrimp aren't filling.
They're a snack food.

127
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:22,983
Hey, you guys talkin'
about shrimp?

128
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,989
Is that something
that you have a problem with?

129
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:29,517
No. No. No.
I just overheard your argument.
I thought it was a good one.

130
00:10:29,595 --> 00:10:32,655
<i>See, check this out.</i>
<i>I go to a party,</i>
<i>right, with a raw bar.</i>

131
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,099
Now, I'm eatin' 30 shrimp,
maybe more,

132
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:38,227
dependin' how I'm feelin'
that particular day.

133
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:41,831
You know,
I'm dousing those fuckers
with the cocktail sauce too.

134
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:47,209
<i>Now, I go to a restaurant,</i>
<i>some monkey suit's bringing</i>
<i>me five shrimp.</i>

135
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,304
He's charging me eight bucks
for the pleasure.

136
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:53,148
<i>I mean, I need that</i>
<i>like I need a fuckin' broom</i>
<i>shoved up my ass.</i>

137
00:10:53,219 --> 00:10:55,653
<i>You know?</i>

138
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:59,487
Okay. You convinced me,
I'm not ordering shrimp cocktail
anymore.

139
00:10:59,558 --> 00:11:04,291
I could go get myself
a hand job for eight bucks.

140
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:06,297
Hey, how ya doin'?
Veal Chop.

141
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:11,029
- Uh-uh.
- No, it's-
it's like a nickname.

142
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,903
Oh, cool.
I-I'm Samuel.

143
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,307
Samuel.

144
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:21,073
- Eddie.
- Eduardo.

145
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,178
Hey, it's good
to meet you gentlemen.
I'm very sorry to interrupt.

146
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,244
It's just, you know,
it's like...

147
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,255
all the little things in life
that really get to me.

148
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:35,690
And for every
shrimp cocktail rip off,
there are 150 swindles...

149
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:37,888
just like it.

150
00:11:37,963 --> 00:11:41,262
<i>The system is trying</i>
<i>to fuck you any chance you get.</i>

151
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,995
- So, you know what I do?
- What?

152
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,903
I fuck right back.

153
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:51,868
Ooh.
Hey, what line of work
are you guys in?

154
00:11:51,944 --> 00:11:54,208
Ooh. We're actually
in business for ourselves.
We have a-

155
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,841
<i>I don't think we really</i>
<i>have to get into that</i>
<i>right now.</i>

156
00:11:57,917 --> 00:12:01,045
Oh.
Hey, enough said.
All right.

157
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:04,620
Hey, let me get you guys
a couple of refreshers.

158
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,284
What are you
workin' on there, huh?
Sloe gin fizzes?

159
00:12:09,695 --> 00:12:13,791
Sure, if you-
Yeah, we'll have
a couple of sloe gin fizzes.

160
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:16,801
I'll be right back.
Okay, two sloe gin fizzes
comin' up.

161
00:12:19,472 --> 00:12:22,168
Ah, but that's
what I'm sayin'.

162
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:27,042
Carpe diem.
Take the bull
by the horns and twist.

163
00:12:27,113 --> 00:12:30,241
- You're right.
- You think I'm gonna wait
for my ship to come in?

164
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:34,275
Bullshit!
I'm gonna sail out to sea
the first chance I get.

165
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,878
Really?
You don't seem like
the seafaring type to me.

166
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:40,915
- Meaning what?
- Meaning when
opportunity presents itself,

167
00:12:40,993 --> 00:12:44,053
well, I'll bet
you pussy out
just like the rest of us.

168
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:46,826
"Veal Chop."

169
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,764
Strong words,
teddy bear.

170
00:12:48,834 --> 00:12:52,292
But, let me try to
talk to that there.

171
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,034
- You mind hearing
a little story?
- No, not at all.

172
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:59,577
<i>Good. 'Cause I think</i>
<i>you're gonna like this story.</i>

173
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,479
- What about me?
<i>- Everyone is gonna love this</i>
<i>story. This is a good story.</i>

174
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:06,677
<i>See, a couple of months ago</i>
<i>a buddy of mine,</i>

175
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:12,486
a male nurse,
he starts to work for this
old, eccentric type of guy.

176
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:17,359
<i>Now, one day, my guy is doing</i>
<i>some light dusting</i>
<i>around the basement,</i>

177
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,489
and he finds that
this old coot has a safe.

178
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:24,024
<i>Now, my buddy, he knows</i>
<i>that I am up for anything.</i>

179
00:13:24,103 --> 00:13:28,199
So he says to me, "Hey, Chop,
why don't you break into
Pappy's?" All right?

180
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:31,266
They call him Pappy.
"Why don't you
break into Pappy's house...

181
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,334
<i>and see what he's got</i>
<i>in that little safe of his?"</i>

182
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,872
<i>So I break in the house, right?</i>
<i>About 6:00 in the P.M.,</i>

183
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:41,408
'cause Pappy goes to bed
at, like, I don't know,
4:00 in the afternoon.

184
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:45,685
I crack that safe,
which is as easy as
opening a can of Fresca,

185
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,023
<i>and gentlemen,</i>
<i>it is raining cash in there.</i>

186
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:52,257
Man, I'm talkin'-
I-I could make, like,

187
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:58,031
a six-foot hoagie sandwich
outta all the dough
that is sittin' in that safe.

188
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:01,630
I mean, this guy- this guy,
he's like one of these guys-
He saved up, like,

189
00:14:01,707 --> 00:14:05,370
<i>90 years worth of paychecks</i>
<i>and they’re just sittin'</i>
<i>in that little unit,</i>

190
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,878
<i>waitin' to be taken.</i>

191
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,416
Now, ya see,
the only problem is...

192
00:14:12,484 --> 00:14:14,509
all I brought
for transportation is...

193
00:14:14,587 --> 00:14:17,249
like, a little
backpack-type of thing.

194
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:22,090
But, now, if I'd had that
kind of valise-

195
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:26,188
Oh, gentlemen,
I would be a whole heck of a lot
richer than I am right now.

196
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,467
<i>By the time I get home,</i>
<i>I flip on</i> Dr. Quinn,
Medicine Woman,

197
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:38,408
and I'm holdin' $36,000 dollars
and Methuselah doesn't even know
he's missin' the dough.

198
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:40,638
Jesus Christ.

199
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:44,342
<i>You cracked this guy's safe</i>
<i>and you made $36,000 dollars?</i>

200
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,748
<i>You have to remember, right,</i>
<i>I'm gonna split it up</i>
<i>with my buddy, right?</i>

201
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:49,447
So, after tax time, yeah.

202
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,388
I'm lookin' at $21,600
in hot, hard cootchie-coo.

203
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:59,424
So, why don't you
go back for more?

204
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:05,198
Eduardo, here's the twist.
And you're not going to believe
this. Are you ready, Eddie?

205
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:09,901
All of the sudden my buddy
has to go out of town
for a family-type situation.

206
00:15:09,975 --> 00:15:13,069
<i>Asks me if I'll look after Pappy</i>
<i>while he's gone, you know,</i>

207
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,012
it's just a temporary
kind of thing.

208
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:18,709
You know, I figure,
look, I've done my share
of male nursing in the past,

209
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,719
<i>and it's the least</i>
<i>I can do for the old guy,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

210
00:15:21,787 --> 00:15:24,278
Considering I just stole
40 grand of his
hard-earned female deer.

211
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:26,824
<i>And I'm gonna take more...</i>

212
00:15:26,892 --> 00:15:29,292
<i>the next chance I get!</i>

213
00:15:29,361 --> 00:15:33,821
- So, you're in?
- Oh, I'm in.
But I'm out.

214
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,531
<i>Apparently, gentlemen,</i>
<i>there's a phenomenon that</i>
<i>develops in male nurses-</i>

215
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,972
it's called
Lawrence Nightingale Syndrome.

216
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:47,240
- I've heard of that.
- You haven't heard of that.

217
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:50,874
<i>Yeah, well see, what happens</i>
<i>is you become attached</i>
<i>to your patients...</i>

218
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,441
on an emotional level.

219
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:56,454
And that is
what starts happening
when you meet Pappy.

220
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:59,150
<i>Let me show you</i>
<i>something here.</i>

221
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:02,057
Oh, yeah.
Pappy.

222
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:07,630
It's Pappy.
He's a real sweet, old man.

223
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,466
You know, his wife died
a couple of years ago,

224
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:14,438
<i>you know, so he's real</i>
<i>lonely and whatnot.</i>

225
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:16,667
<i>Well, a lot of times,</i>

226
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:19,836
he'll just be lying there
in a-a-

227
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:22,779
in a puddle
of his own make.

228
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:27,114
I just kind of cradled him
and stuff, ya know.

229
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:32,283
- You couldn't
steal from Pappy?
- No, I could not, Sambo.

230
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:35,293
<i>No, I could not.</i>

231
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,558
<i>Thanks.</i>

232
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,689
Oh, Pappy!

233
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:44,497
So, I mean,
that's where I'm at right now.

234
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,266
My buddy's still out of town
for another three weeks, right?

235
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,204
And I'm livin'
in this old guy's house,

236
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,572
I'm sniffin' up the fumes
of a fucking fortune...

237
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,407
my Goddamn conscience
won't let me touch.

238
00:16:57,483 --> 00:17:00,247
<i>God bless Pappy.</i>

239
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,252
Who knows how long that
old fucker's gonna hang on.

240
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:10,455
<i>And there's $311,000 dollars</i>
<i>just sittin' in that safe,</i>

241
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:12,463
waiting for a man named...

242
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,267
Da Chop.

243
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,822
Who'd care for
another spirit?

244
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:47,023
He's setting us up.
He's not setting us up.

245
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:49,033
He's got
Lawrence Nightingale Syndrome.

246
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:51,592
The guy gets 50 percent
for giving us an address.

247
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,763
Hey, we don't know
Veal Chop.

248
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,773
We don't even know
if his name is
Veal Chop.

249
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,775
It's not his name.
It's a nickname.

250
00:17:57,843 --> 00:17:59,777
Like, you know, Meat Loaf.
Wait, you don't see
anything morally wrong...

251
00:17:59,845 --> 00:18:01,779
by stealing money
from this old guy?

252
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,680
I'm not trying to upset you,
but your father's a crook.

253
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,082
Why are you grilling me
on the moral angle?
You know why.

254
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,211
'Cause you come
from a good family.

255
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,917
I mean, do you have any idea
what your parents would think if
they knew you stooped to this?

256
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:17,360
My fucking parents haven't
called me since we did our act
at my Dad's 60th birthday party.

257
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,398
They think
I'm a freak.

258
00:18:20,466 --> 00:18:22,400
We're not thieves,
Eddie, we're singers.

259
00:18:22,468 --> 00:18:25,096
And I like to think of Pappy
as a very generous
patron of the arts.

260
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:29,038
Hey, don't kid yourself. If we
do this thing, we are thieves.
We're not thieves.

261
00:18:36,014 --> 00:18:39,211
This isn't quite as simple
as Mr. Veal Chop described.

262
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,018
Come on, Sugar.
Open sesame.

263
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:45,022
I think we should
get outta here.
All right.

264
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,024
Give me a second here,
I'm close.

265
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,030
Let me get in there.

266
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,238
It's open.

267
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,774
It's wide open.
Look at that.
It's open.

268
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:06,242
- It's open?
- Pappy?

269
00:19:09,715 --> 00:19:11,649
Time to make the doughnuts,
gentlemen.

270
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,916
Shit!

271
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,456
You're not happy?

272
00:19:18,524 --> 00:19:21,618
<i>What did I say to you?</i>
<i>I said, "Veal Chop</i>
<i>is setting us up."</i>

273
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,924
You walked right into this house
without too many any arguments,
if I recall correctly.

274
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,524
<i>I said, "Sam, Veal Chop</i>
<i>is setting us up!"</i>

275
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,501
What the fuck
is your real name,
anyway?

276
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:34,038
It's Veal Chop.

277
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:38,440
Listen, Veal Chop, I think
I speak for Eddie here-
Hey, don't speak for me.

278
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,776
This is-This is clearly
a misunderstanding.

279
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,511
So I think you should probably
get Pappy out here.

280
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,952
<i>And we can all</i>
<i>just sort this thing out.</i>
<i>We can just walk away.</i>

281
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,459
You know what, Sam?
I'm actually
not gonna let you go.

282
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,460
See, 'cause if I let you go,

283
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,895
<i>my boss'll</i>
<i>get very upset with me.</i>

284
00:19:59,965 --> 00:20:03,492
And when he gets upset,
terrible things start to happen.

285
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:05,764
Who the hell do you work for?

286
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:08,431
You wanna know
who I work for?

287
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:13,910
Me.

288
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,346
- My name is Bernie Gayle.
- You're Big Fat Bernie Gayle.

289
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,442
Mm. I really prefer
people not use the fat part.

290
00:20:20,519 --> 00:20:22,510
Okay.

291
00:20:22,588 --> 00:20:27,582
The important thing
is you recognized me.

292
00:20:27,659 --> 00:20:30,423
Well, there's not
too many Jewish gangsters
in Providence.

293
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:32,690
Oh, no.
There are a couple of us.

294
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:35,232
Look.
I could talk all night.

295
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,393
But I'd really like
to get in a steam bath
before dinner.

296
00:20:37,469 --> 00:20:41,200
So, here's the thing
with this whole thing.

297
00:20:41,273 --> 00:20:44,208
I think we can all agree
that there's no Pappy.

298
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:47,336
And, since there's no Pappy,
then this is clearly my home.

299
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:51,007
- Are you not a male nurse?
- Sorry, son.

300
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:55,019
This is my home.
And you broke into it.

301
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,555
And, now, it's time
for a little payback.

302
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,457
Sir, uh, I'm not tryin'
to be a dick here.

303
00:21:01,526 --> 00:21:03,517
But what are you-
what are you talking about?

304
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:07,190
You broke into my house
and tried to steal from me.

305
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,496
- You tried to take
what is mine.

306
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,401
You tried to make me
look like a fuckin' idiot.

307
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:14,632
This had nothin'
to do with you.

308
00:21:14,706 --> 00:21:17,004
Do you think you can take
from Big Fat Bernie Gayle?

309
00:21:17,075 --> 00:21:19,475
- Is that what you think?
Because you cannot.
- I thought you were Pappy.

310
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:22,536
You cannot take
from the home...

311
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,913
where my late wife and I
raised the child that I love.

312
00:21:25,984 --> 00:21:28,953
- You cannot upset
the natural order...

313
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,989
of the way things work...

314
00:21:31,056 --> 00:21:35,049
<i>by stealin' from me</i>
<i>or Pappy or anyone else.</i>

315
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,891
- I work!
Do you understand that?
- Please.

316
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,955
- I fuckin' work!
- Please!
Please, God! Please!

317
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:44,902
Eh, I'm not gonna kill ya.

318
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,537
I said, I'm not gonna kill ya.
Relax.
He's not gonna kill you.

319
00:21:52,611 --> 00:21:57,344
I love you,
Big Fat Piggy.
I love you. I love you.

320
00:21:57,416 --> 00:21:59,782
Shut up!
He said he's not
gonna kill us.

321
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:02,445
Christ!
For somebody in your field,
you act like a fuckin' sissy.

322
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,456
- What?
- These are
the legendary safe men?

323
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:08,721
These are the guys, yeah.
Hmm.

324
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:11,388
The what?

325
00:22:12,798 --> 00:22:15,528
You're not gonna come clean,
are you?

326
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,127
- Why do you think
we set you up?
- Um, 'cause-

327
00:22:19,204 --> 00:22:21,434
Now, you have a debt
to pay off.

328
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,270
<i>Is there a better commodity</i>
<i>than two guys...</i>

329
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:28,040
who can crack any safe
in the city of Providence?

330
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,047
Oh, we're not safecrackers.

331
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,050
Well, you sure could've
fuckin' fooled me.

332
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,712
Cracking into that fine piece
of finished finery
in the other room.

333
00:22:35,787 --> 00:22:37,880
It was open.

334
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,127
Thank you,
Eddie.

335
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:50,156
You left the safe open?
It was an accident.

336
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:53,261
How can I know
these guys are the guys
if you left the safe open?

337
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,272
How am I gonna
know that?
I don't know.

338
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:00,403
You and I are going to have a
discussion about responsibility
after you dispose of these two.

339
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,514
We're the best.

340
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,017
What was that?

341
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:09,747
It's not our fault
that Veal Chop
left the safe open.

342
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:11,755
We're the best.

343
00:23:11,823 --> 00:23:15,623
Big, they had the duffel bag,
the drinks. They kept-

344
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:19,129
You guys are the guys?

345
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,189
We're the best.
We're good.

346
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,006
To repay your debt to me,
I'm gonna give the two of you
one week...

347
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,546
to crack three safes
of my own personal choosing.

348
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,014
<i>And if you don't do this,</i>

349
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,210
then we are going
to find ourselves...

350
00:23:40,285 --> 00:23:42,617
in a very
uncomfortable situation.

351
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:45,986
Uh, Mr. B-Big F-Bernard.

352
00:23:46,057 --> 00:23:51,051
<i>I'm gonna suggest</i>
<i>that we all just, like,</i>
<i>go out for a late supper.</i>

353
00:23:51,129 --> 00:23:56,294
Maybe a couple of sambucas.
And just forget about
this whole thing.

354
00:23:56,368 --> 00:24:00,236
I'm gonna go take a shit,
then I'm gonna have a <i>shvitz.</i>

355
00:24:00,305 --> 00:24:05,368
Chop, is it too much
to ask you to tell these guys
where the first safe is?

356
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,912
I didn't mean
to leave it open, Big.

357
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:12,416
<i>- Uh-</i>
- I've had it
up to my tits with you.

358
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:17,144
<i>Mazel tov,</i> gentlemen.
Best of luck.

359
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:22,459
<i>What do you think?</i>

360
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:26,224
<i>Huh? Huh?</i>

361
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,461
It's too pungent.

362
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,468
What is this?
Is this peppermint?

363
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,733
<i>No, that's actually</i>
<i>a really mild mandarin orange.</i>

364
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,001
And your name is?
<i>Sherry.</i>

365
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,533
Sherry, where am I finding
country jams?

366
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:42,910
Country jams and preserves
are just to your left.

367
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,846
Apricot or raspberry?

368
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,854
Whatever, Sam.

369
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,856
I kinda feel
like everybody does raspberry,

370
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:55,722
so maybe we should
go with apricot.

371
00:24:57,028 --> 00:25:00,725
Raspberry has a fuller flavor
at this time of year.

372
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,733
That's a good point.

373
00:25:02,801 --> 00:25:05,269
All right.
I think we're good.

374
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:09,865
And you can put this together
nicely with crepe paper and
ribbon and stuff?

375
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:12,637
We're gonna make it
look superspecial, sir.

376
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,703
Great. So, it's going
to a Bernard Gayle...

377
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,341
<i>at 119 Hope Street,</i>
<i>which is-</i>

378
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:22,409
- Can I talk to you
for a minute?
<i>- What's goin' on?</i>

379
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:26,184
This man is in the Mafia, Sam.
Do you understand that?

380
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:28,192
He's not gonna
let us off the hook...

381
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,696
because we send him
a fucking basket
of sundry goods.

382
00:25:31,763 --> 00:25:33,697
He's in the Jewish Mafia.

383
00:25:33,765 --> 00:25:36,359
I'm sure that's
much more like a club
than an actual organization.

384
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,368
Let me explain somethin' here.

385
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,666
You and I are pussies.

386
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:45,142
<i>We don't have a chance</i>
<i>of cracking one safe,</i>
<i>let alone three.</i>

387
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,303
Which is why-
But you know
who can do stuff like that?

388
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:52,316
Tough guys.
Guys that Veal Chop
thought we were.

389
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:57,048
How much?
- Sixteen.

390
00:25:57,122 --> 00:25:59,283
<i>Which is why</i>
<i>I think we should see...</i>

391
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,815
how he responds
to the gift basket and then
play it out from there.

392
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,887
No. You're gonna
have to call him and tell him
that we can't do it.

393
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:10,332
Why can't you
just call your fucking father
and ask him for some help?

394
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,336
Don't turn this into a thing
about my father. All right?
I'm not.

395
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,100
I just don't see
why you can't call him.
Because it's just not an option.

396
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:18,665
Well, I don't feel comfortable
calling Bernie. So, it's going
to a Bernard Gayle.

397
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:22,873
Call him, Sam.
Don't!
Back off.

398
00:26:22,948 --> 00:26:25,348
- Bitch.
<i>- Ow!</i>

399
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,977
So, it's going
to a Bernard Gayle. Okay.

400
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,075
Hello.
Hi. Who's this?

401
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,338
This is
Big Fat Bernie Gayle Jr.

402
00:26:54,412 --> 00:26:56,676
Well, hello Little Big Fat.

403
00:26:56,748 --> 00:27:00,912
Can you put Big Fat
Bernie Gayle Sr. on the phone?
Okay.

404
00:27:02,253 --> 00:27:04,278
Daddy! Telephone.

405
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,957
No shouting
in the house, Bernard.

406
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:10,961
Yeah.

407
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,123
Hi, Bernie. It's Samuel.
Who?

408
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,929
The safe guy from last night.
What is it?
I'm exercising.

409
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:19,562
Listen. Eddie and I
talked it over...

410
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:22,266
and we really think
that because
of the Pappy technicality...

411
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:25,241
and the... scheduling
and everything...

412
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:28,746
we're gonna kind of pass
on doin' the safe thing.

413
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:34,547
Samuel, I'm gonna
put you on hold
for a minute here.

414
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:36,644
I'm on hold.
Oh.

415
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:41,658
If you don't crack
the safes,

416
00:27:41,726 --> 00:27:45,890
I'm gonna come over to where
you live, I'm gonna
saw both your legs off,

417
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:47,898
then I'm gonna beat you
over the head with the stumps.

418
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:56,099
<i>At this point, I was frightened</i>
<i>like a little infant.</i>

419
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,506
<i>Though Eddie's father</i>
<i>was some kind</i>
<i>of master criminal,</i>

420
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:00,601
<i>he and I were</i>
<i>singer-songwriters.</i>

421
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:04,445
<i>And our situation had just taken</i>
<i>a turn for the worse.</i>

422
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:13,320
See the skylight?

423
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,351
Hey! Hey.
What?

424
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:21,194
I can't believe you.
What?

425
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:25,959
What's goin' on
back there?
Nothin'. Nothin'.

426
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,971
Why would you
wear that tonight?
I'm not wearing it.

427
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:39,278
Sam... I could feel it
back there.

428
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,154
If you had to deal
with like half of the shit...

429
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:46,713
that I've been through
in the past year,

430
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:49,123
you'd strap on
one of these fuckers.

431
00:28:49,194 --> 00:28:52,129
Just like me,
you'd strap it right on.

432
00:28:54,966 --> 00:29:00,495
Let's open the fucking skylight.

433
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,269
I wanna get off now.
Okay. Um, why?

434
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:06,537
Because I'm tired...

435
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:08,636
and I wanna make
some juice...

436
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,011
and we're not
going out anymore?

437
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,277
<i>Okay. I-I hear that.</i>
<i>I hear that.</i>

438
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,878
<i>Uh, so, then,</i>
<i>maybe I should probably</i>
<i>call you back in the morning.</i>

439
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:20,686
<i>You know what? I don't think</i>
<i>that's a good idea.</i>

440
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,353
<i>Well, what if I still like you</i>
<i>more than just a friend?</i>

441
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,828
Frank, you really don't need
to deal with this anymore.

442
00:29:25,897 --> 00:29:29,094
I'm sure Mitchell would love
to hear about your problems.

443
00:29:29,167 --> 00:29:31,362
I'm wearin' a mustache now.

444
00:29:31,436 --> 00:29:34,735
Wow.
That's really great.
It's growin' in pretty well.

445
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,536
Frank, I'm gonna very gently
put down the receiver now.

446
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,601
<i>It's gettin' pretty thick</i>
<i>and hairy and stuff.</i>
I'm hanging up the phone.

447
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,670
Really? Okay. 'Cause, um-
Did you get my gift basket?

448
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:46,615
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>I thought you'd</i>
<i>be into, like,</i>

449
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:48,618
the mustards and
the peppercorn salami and shit.

450
00:29:48,686 --> 00:29:52,053
- It was really nice, Frank.
<i>- Maybe you could use it</i>
<i>in your cookin' or-</i>

451
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,751
I'm gonna talk to you
some other time. Okay?
Say hi to Mitchell.

452
00:29:54,826 --> 00:29:59,456
Maybe in the near future we
could go on a picnic. Hello?

453
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:05,167
I'm getting close.
I can taste it.

454
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:10,037
Oh, I'm chafing like an idiot.
Shh. Be quiet
for a second.

455
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,608
What are these, polyester?

456
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:18,809
I got a good price
on a polycotton blend.

457
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,147
Damn. Do you realize
how high these are riding?

458
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:25,019
They're irregular.
Yes.

459
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:27,353
I am chafing
like a fucking idiot.

460
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:30,258
It's like grated parmesan
between my legs.
Hey. Hey.

461
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:34,264
<i>You think</i>
<i>I don't chafe? You think</i>
<i>I don't feel the high ride?</i>

462
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:38,268
I don't know what you feel.
I chafe. I'm sick,
I'm chafing so much.

463
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,501
Plus, I'm wearing a
fake fucking ass over my ass.

464
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,702
But that's not what I'm thinking
about at this particular
moment in time.

465
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:49,907
Well, I am thinking about
the thigh-high chicken parmesan
sandwich between my legs.

466
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,915
Well, you should
be thinking about-
Maybe I don't-

467
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,645
I can't think
about this stuff-
Well, good God.

468
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,483
Hello.
Hey.
Hi.

469
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:01,321
- How are you?
- I'm pretty good. I just
came down for a fruit drink.

470
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:03,383
Okay, then.

471
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,452
Um, you guys are breaking into
my dad's safe.

472
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:10,797
No.
This is not-This is-
This is different.

473
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,635
Well, from over here
it kinda looks like
you're tryin' to crack the safe.

474
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,142
Okay. Here's the thing.
We are cracking the safe.

475
00:31:18,209 --> 00:31:22,270
But it has
no personal connection
to you at all.

476
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,247
It's not about you.

477
00:31:24,315 --> 00:31:27,409
It's about us
and stuff we're dealing with.

478
00:31:27,485 --> 00:31:29,578
<i>Even though</i>
<i>that's really a relief,</i>

479
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,953
- I feel like maybe I should
go wake up my dad.
- Don't do that.

480
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:35,686
- You don't think
I should wake him up?
- I think it's beneath you.

481
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,024
You know what
I'm saying?

482
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:41,759
I feel like-
like you win and we lose,

483
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,767
and there's nothin' more
to say.

484
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,771
Um-

485
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,605
- Hannah.
- Samuel.

486
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:57,111
Hi. This is Eddie.

487
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,116
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

488
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:04,314
Uh, there's no way-
No.

489
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:08,189
- What?
- No. It's ridiculous. I just
had a question. I was-

490
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:10,659
- What?
- There's no way
that you could just give us...

491
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:13,026
the combination
to the safe?

492
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,190
I'm not gonna tell you
the combination to the safe.

493
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,463
Uh, I'm sorry. That was
a really stupid question.

494
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:20,470
We should go.

495
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:24,065
- Okay.
- Right there?

496
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:25,803
Oh, yeah.

497
00:32:30,748 --> 00:32:35,708
Do you guys want some juice
or something for the road?

498
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,984
We should go. But I'd love
to take a rain check.

499
00:32:39,057 --> 00:32:41,321
I can't.

500
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:45,260
- You're involved with someone.
- No. I try
not to date thieves.

501
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:48,527
I'm not a thief. We're not-

502
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:53,435
My dad works with thieves.
And my last boyfriend
was a thief.

503
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,904
Is your dad a cop
or something?

504
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,704
- No, he's a fence.
- What's a fence?

505
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,006
You're breaking into my house
and you don't know
what a fence is?

506
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:05,778
They operate
kind of like a s-store.

507
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,841
<i>Um, thieves will</i>
<i>bring in, uh,</i>

508
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,479
stolen merchandise,

509
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:12,489
uh, sell it to a fence,

510
00:33:12,557 --> 00:33:16,323
who, in turn, sells it back
to, uh, educated consumers,

511
00:33:16,394 --> 00:33:21,593
who know they're purchasing
quality, albeit hot, products...

512
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:26,467
at a competitive price.

513
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:30,268
Okay. Because I thought
you were talking about
a-a lence.

514
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,038
<i>That's a little different.</i>
What's a lence?

515
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:39,072
They're, uh,
woodworking, primarily.

516
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:42,483
- So, what do you do?
- My dad's store
is on Wickendon Street.

517
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,487
That's where I work.

518
00:33:44,555 --> 00:33:48,548
Well, so, then you're
a fence too?

519
00:33:48,626 --> 00:33:50,560
No, I'm a chef. I make
homemade hors d'oeuvres...

520
00:33:50,628 --> 00:33:53,062
and I kinda pass 'em
around the store
throughout the day.

521
00:33:53,131 --> 00:33:55,964
- That's really cool.
- I enjoy it.

522
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:59,492
Yeah. So, let me go over
a couple of things here.

523
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,300
Actually, I really kinda
want you guys to go.

524
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:06,605
Okay. No.
Because that- Okay. Hey.
Okay. No. Let's go.

525
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:11,273
Bye.

526
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,485
Sorry.

527
00:34:19,824 --> 00:34:21,314
You're killing me!

528
00:34:33,638 --> 00:34:37,768
<i>Hey, we're back, Bernie.</i>

529
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,485
He rousts me
a couple of times a week.
I love it.

530
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:52,819
- Oh, nice.
- Helps keep the weight down.

531
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:57,827
Where's the loot?

532
00:34:57,895 --> 00:34:59,863
Uh, here's the thing.

533
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:04,834
There was this daughter,
and she almost caught us.
It was a real fluke.

534
00:35:04,902 --> 00:35:07,132
They couldn't crack
the safe.

535
00:35:07,205 --> 00:35:11,164
<i>Whoa.</i>
<i>It's not that we couldn't</i>
<i>crack the safe,</i>

536
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:14,006
<i>it's just that we never really</i>
<i>got the chance.</i>
So you didn't crack the safe?

537
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:17,343
- Nope.
- Well, according to the rules
of gangster etiquette,

538
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:19,349
I could, you know, kill you.

539
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,408
You don't want to do that.

540
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,420
<i>Oh, no.</i>
<i>I didn't say I would.</i>

541
00:35:23,488 --> 00:35:28,721
I was just thinkin'
out loud here.
But there is a saving grace.

542
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,852
I know that daughter.
Set her up on a date
with Veal Chop once.

543
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:33,897
I tried to put my tongue
in her mouth.
She punched me in the penis.

544
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:40,597
<i>She's got a thing for bad guys.</i>
<i>It's like forbidden fruit.</i>
<i>Turns her on.</i>

545
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:45,040
- Not Veal Chop actually?
- Fuck off, Eddie.

546
00:35:45,109 --> 00:35:48,078
The point is,
she's got a sixth sense
when thieves are around.

547
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,080
Without some kind
of telekinesis,

548
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,275
there is no way
that she could've known
that we were in that house.

549
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:55,478
Eddie and I were tomcats
in there. We were invisible.

550
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:57,646
I'm gonna let you go
with a stern warning this time.

551
00:35:57,722 --> 00:36:00,156
But if you screw up
on the next two safes,
then I'm gonna kill ya.

552
00:36:00,224 --> 00:36:03,159
Let's get these guys outta here.
Bernie Jr. has a Hebrew lesson
at 5:00.

553
00:36:03,227 --> 00:36:05,627
Oh, yeah.

554
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:09,966
My kid is getting
bar mitzvahed on Saturday.

555
00:36:10,034 --> 00:36:13,492
Hey. Hey.
Have you got a suit picked out?
Oh.

556
00:36:13,571 --> 00:36:18,008
You're not gonna believe
this kid.
He worships his daddy.

557
00:36:18,075 --> 00:36:21,272
The kid insists
on wearing a sweat suit.

558
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:26,408
- Really. Oh.
- Eh, we're gonna do
a theme type of thing.

559
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,975
You know, father and son
in matching workout gear.

560
00:36:29,053 --> 00:36:32,181
<i>All Sergio Tacchini.</i>

561
00:36:32,256 --> 00:36:34,247
Wow.
Wow. That's fantastic.

562
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:36,691
<i>Yeah. Great. Yes.</i>

563
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,662
- Is it nylon?
- Stop kissin' my ass,
Samuel.

564
00:36:40,731 --> 00:36:42,665
Chop,

565
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:45,258
do you think
you can learn these two guys
where the next safe is?

566
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:47,964
It's done and "doner."

567
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,371
Why can't you
just say fucking "Yes"
when I ask you a question?

568
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,875
Sorry.

569
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,479
<i>You are gonna love this haircut.</i>

570
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,484
<i>Just love it.</i>
<i>Look at this.</i>

571
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:05,989
Do you guys want some gravlax
on a bed of beef tartar?

572
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:08,389
<i>This looks good.</i>
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

573
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:11,485
Oh, that looks terrific.
Oh.

574
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,292
T-Tryin' to rob your house.
You came in.

575
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,163
- Samuel. Hi.
- Hannah. Hi.

576
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:21,194
- What are you doin' here?
- Um, I thought you said
to come by.

577
00:37:21,272 --> 00:37:23,331
No.

578
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,774
Oh, 'cause I came by.

579
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:31,679
<i>Is this your dad's store?</i>
Um, yeah. Sort of.

580
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,047
<i>You guys can stop pretending.</i>
<i>That's a good piece of fish,</i>
<i>Hannah.</i>

581
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,086
It makes a nice sandwich.

582
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,217
No. Come in.
You should see our place.

583
00:37:41,292 --> 00:37:43,920
Okay.

584
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:51,058
Psst. Who's the hippie?
I have no idea.

585
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:59,067
Holy shit.

586
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:01,077
Here, take a gravlax.
Oh, thanks.

587
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:03,841
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>I think it's Phil Bradford.</i>

588
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:06,348
These are fantastic.
Thank you.

589
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:11,047
They're going over
pretty well.

590
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,250
I've already moved
over 80 of them, and it's
not even lunchtime yet.

591
00:38:14,325 --> 00:38:16,759
Oh. That's a-
That's a lot.

592
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:20,490
That's a good number.
Yeah.

593
00:38:20,564 --> 00:38:22,964
So, I'm sorry
about the other night.

594
00:38:23,034 --> 00:38:26,595
No. I feel bad.
I totally screwed up
you guys' break-in.

595
00:38:26,671 --> 00:38:31,472
Well, on those lines,
would you be interested
in casually dating?

596
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:34,602
Hannah, sweetie. Do you think
we could move some more
of the gravlax before lunch?

597
00:38:34,679 --> 00:38:36,613
- I've got people
starving inside.
- Yeah.

598
00:38:36,681 --> 00:38:39,946
I'm kinda in the middle
of something right now, Dad.

599
00:38:41,619 --> 00:38:44,315
This is Sam.
Sam, this is my dad,
Good Stuff Leo.

600
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:47,687
- Is he a crook?
- Honestly, Dad.

601
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:52,422
Sorry.
Hello, Samuel.
<i>Hi, Good Stuff.</i>

602
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:56,159
Hello. I love your store.
<i>That's very nice.</i>

603
00:38:56,233 --> 00:38:58,167
Feel free to browse
when you're done
flirting with my daughter.

604
00:38:58,235 --> 00:39:01,363
Okay.
<i>Sweetie.</i>

605
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:04,704
When you get a minute,
it wouldn't kill you
with the salmon.

606
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:11,108
Let's go out. Just like
a friend type of thing.

607
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:15,551
- So, tonight?
Whoa.

608
00:39:15,619 --> 00:39:18,349
Tonight? I, uh-
Actually, I can't do it tonight.

609
00:39:18,422 --> 00:39:21,289
- Because you're
robbing someplace.
- Please. I'm insulted.

610
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,619
Tomorrow my dad and I are having
a bunch of people over
to celebrate Rosh Hashanah.

611
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,189
- What's that.
- It's the Jewish New Year.

612
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:33,168
I guess it would be sort
of harmless if you came to that.

613
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:36,206
Okay. Very cool.

614
00:39:36,273 --> 00:39:38,434
Bye, Sam.
Okay.

615
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,443
Good luck
with your next robbery.

616
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:42,741
Oh, I told you, I'm done-
I-I have a function tonight.

617
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:46,146
I'm not robbing anymore.

618
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,447
I'm serious.
Okay.

619
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:50,453
I'm an honest man.

620
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:52,716
Okay.
Okay.

621
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:54,724
All right.
Okay.

622
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:08,835
<i>Baba-ba-ba-ba.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

623
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,939
<i>This is your</i>
<i>Torah portion, B.J.</i>

624
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,272
<i>Now don't be afraid</i>
<i>to push it a little bit.</i>
<i>All right?</i>

625
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:16,973
Listen to me
for a second.

626
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:20,448
Join me.

627
00:40:25,723 --> 00:40:27,657
Bring it up
a little higher.

628
00:40:27,725 --> 00:40:30,159
Emphasize the-
Go for it.

629
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:42,197
<i>We've got a long way</i>
<i>to go here, Beej.</i>

630
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,207
<i>Ooh, ooh, aagh.</i>

631
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:48,644
Aagh!
Sweet shot!

632
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,646
Whoo!

633
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:52,648
So you psyched
to become a man?

634
00:40:52,716 --> 00:40:55,651
I don't know.
Your mom would
have been real
proud of you.

635
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,653
I guess so.

636
00:40:57,721 --> 00:41:00,155
<i>Your dad's pumped up.</i>

637
00:41:00,224 --> 00:41:03,751
<i>He's been...</i>
<i>a little on edge</i>
<i>and stuff.</i>

638
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:08,094
You know,
it's weird.

639
00:41:08,165 --> 00:41:11,430
Sometimes I feel like,
you know,

640
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:16,269
he thinks I'm no good
or whatever, you know.

641
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:18,274
Okay.

642
00:41:18,342 --> 00:41:22,904
<i>You're a lucky fuck,</i>
<i>Bernie Jr.</i>

643
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,849
Fuck.
All right.
Shit.

644
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,909
That's game.

645
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,150
Good convo,
big man.
Bye, Veal Chop.

646
00:41:39,763 --> 00:41:43,563
Hey.

647
00:41:43,634 --> 00:41:46,432
What say you call me
by my real name.

648
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:48,369
All right.

649
00:41:48,439 --> 00:41:51,169
All right.
Now, can you keep
a secret?

650
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,870
Yeah.
Yeah?

651
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:57,107
It's Sasha.

652
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,981
All right.

653
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:05,454
Okay. I've got
to give your dad
a liniment rubdown.

654
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,889
Adios,
tough turf.
Bye, Sasha.

655
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,892
All right.

656
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:13,727
All right.
Here we go.

657
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,857
Spinning the dial-
What?

658
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:18,868
Uh, three revolutions.

659
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:22,770
Spinning,
spinning,
spinning...

660
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,774
and nothing.

661
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,969
Fuck.
Okay.
Not a problem.

662
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:32,277
Going back two spins
to the left and-

663
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,283
Wait a minute.

664
00:42:34,351 --> 00:42:37,650
Wait one good
goddamn second here...

665
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,157
Eduardo, because...
it is-

666
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:44,058
What?

667
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:46,961
No, it's nothing.
Shit.

668
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:51,033
They're geniuses.

669
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:53,968
They're
not geniuses.
The raccoon is
hands down...

670
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:57,906
the smartest animal
in the entire
animal kingdom.

671
00:42:57,975 --> 00:43:00,910
That's fact.
People acknowledge
that shit.

672
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:03,913
It's not smarter
than a pig.

673
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:07,178
It's in
a different league
than the pig.

674
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:12,748
I just don't think it can
be smarter than a pig.

675
00:43:12,823 --> 00:43:15,018
I heard the click.

676
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:18,186
All right. Okay. All right.
Uh, "First pin being engaged."

677
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,355
Three more and we're
home free.
Okay.

678
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,699
Contact.

679
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,702
You're getting
a little bit excited
out here, aren't you?

680
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:30,433
I'm not getting excited.
It's just...
nice to hear a click.

681
00:43:32,209 --> 00:43:35,508
This is an animal
that's gonna walk up
to your driveway,

682
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,207
know exactly
when you're asleep.

683
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,216
They're nocturnal
by nature.

684
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:44,812
No, man.
This genius knows
when you're asleep.

685
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,322
He knows how
to untie your trash.

686
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:51,384
How to separate
the edible products
from the nonedibles.

687
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,522
He's doing
all kind of work
with the recycled shit.

688
00:43:54,598 --> 00:43:57,089
It's the fucking bomb.

689
00:43:57,167 --> 00:44:00,830
I read in <i>Omni</i> last month
that there's
a guy in Finland...

690
00:44:00,904 --> 00:44:04,135
who taught his pig
how to speak Finnish.

691
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:06,972
A pig is
a smart little bastard,
Frank.

692
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,410
Nobody's arguing that.

693
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,573
But the raccoon's
a genius.

694
00:44:25,796 --> 00:44:29,095
Come on, Frank.
Don't be shy.

695
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:34,001
Okay. For me,
it'd be Farrah Fawcett,

696
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:38,599
Jaclyn Smith, and then
who's the one that replaced
Farrah, the first one?

697
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:42,134
Tanya Roberts.
Yeah, that's my pick.
Tanya Roberts.

698
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:47,377
Given the choice,
I'd make love
to Farrah Fawcett first.

699
00:44:47,451 --> 00:44:51,319
Then Kate Jackson
because I always found her
very sexually attractive.

700
00:44:51,388 --> 00:44:57,122
And last?
My last angel would be...
the last angel, Shelley.

701
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:02,063
What the hell
was her last name?
Uh... Duvall.

702
00:45:04,568 --> 00:45:08,504
No, that's not right.

703
00:45:19,249 --> 00:45:23,549
Shelley.

704
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:25,850
Shelley.

705
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:32,293
We're done.
Okay.

706
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:35,058
Let's go get
a sloe gin fizz.

707
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:47,973
<i>Shelley Hack.</i>

708
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,910
What did you say?
What?

709
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,107
Shelley Hack.
Don't call me
Shelley Hack.

710
00:45:52,182 --> 00:45:54,150
No, you just
called me
Shelley Hack.

711
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:56,083
I didn't say
anything close
to Shelley Hack.

712
00:45:56,153 --> 00:45:59,054
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
that you did.

713
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,126
Jaclyn Smith.

714
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,128
What?
What?

715
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,130
Why did you just call me
Jaclyn Smith?

716
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:10,189
I didn't just call you
Jaclyn Smith.

717
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:13,703
Look, get over it, okay?
I didn't call you Shelley Hack.

718
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,296
I heard you say her name
very clearly.

719
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,308
Oh, yeah.
Well, I didn't. Okay?

720
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,347
Kate Jackson.

721
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,917
You know,
I'm glad that we're not
gonna crack this safe.

722
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:32,922
Why?

723
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:36,551
Because that means
somebody's gonna
kill you.

724
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,720
Yeah, well,
they're going
to kill you too.

725
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:43,699
Yeah. Well, you give
and you take, Samuel.
You give and take.

726
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:49,136
<i>I'm not fuckin' kiddin' anymore.</i>

727
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:52,266
I'm going to kill
the both of you
right fuckin' now.

728
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,276
Do you think that I care
that my kid is standing
next to me?

729
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:58,781
I don't give a fucking shit!
It's good for him to see this.

730
00:46:58,849 --> 00:47:01,113
<i>Let him learn</i>
<i>a thing or two</i>
<i>about tough love.</i>

731
00:47:01,185 --> 00:47:05,212
- Bernie, please, just give us-
- Shut up, Sam, you assless fuck.

732
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:07,223
Please.

733
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:19,200
<i>I'm giving you guys two days</i>
<i>to break into the next safe.</i>

734
00:47:19,269 --> 00:47:22,670
And if you don't do that,
then I'm going to shoot you
so hard through the skull...

735
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:28,609
that your cock is gonna
go spinning around
like a fuckin' Skil saw.

736
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:30,909
Understood?

737
00:47:33,483 --> 00:47:36,350
No.

738
00:47:37,955 --> 00:47:42,551
- What?
- I honestly...

739
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:45,186
don't get the part
about the saw.

740
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:48,060
It's a metaphor.

741
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:51,157
- I don't get that.
- It's a little vague.

742
00:47:51,235 --> 00:47:54,068
It is?

743
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:59,569
All right.
I'm sorry.

744
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:01,577
I'll make it clearer
next time.

745
00:48:01,645 --> 00:48:04,614
Just clarify it
a little.

746
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,241
Hmm?

747
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,842
Oow!

748
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:20,028
Why didn't you
kill those guys,
Daddy?

749
00:48:20,097 --> 00:48:25,125
Because, Bernie Jr.,
those are men with balls
the size of casaba melons.

750
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:32,937
- I don't follow, Big.
- Open your eyes, Chop.

751
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:36,138
<i>My office guy said they</i>
<i>made off with $67,000 bucks.</i>

752
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:39,512
<i>How come they didn't tell you</i>
<i>about it?</i>

753
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,883
They are true thieves,
Bernie Jr.

754
00:48:43,954 --> 00:48:46,684
When you crack
a tough safe
like they just did,

755
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,622
they're not going
to part
with the goods.

756
00:48:48,692 --> 00:48:51,160
They're too connected
to it.
Oh.

757
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:58,025
Hey, uh, Big,

758
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:01,093
do I get fitted out
for a sweat suit too?

759
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:03,696
You see
a third tailor here?

760
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:07,107
No.
<i>Honey, how do your pants fit?</i>

761
00:49:07,177 --> 00:49:11,341
Well, they're kind of tight
on my tushie.

762
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:13,349
Herman,
keep 'em like that.

763
00:49:13,417 --> 00:49:16,318
Let the ladies know
he's a Gayle.

764
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:26,695
Hey, uh,
you gonna be back
in 15 minutes?

765
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:29,789
Less. I'm gonna give Hannah
a quick hello. I'm gonna take
a lap around the party.

766
00:49:29,866 --> 00:49:32,266
I'm gonna get a light supper
and then I'm out.

767
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,897
When you, uh, come back,
we're gonna prepare
for the next safe.

768
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,101
Yeah. And you're
definitely sure that's
the best thing to do?

769
00:49:40,377 --> 00:49:43,574
It is just the only
thing to do, Sam.

770
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:46,343
These fucking guys
are gonna kill us...

771
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:49,317
if we come back
to them empty-handed
a third time.

772
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:52,082
Okay.
Guys like Bernie
do not play around.

773
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:58,050
Okay, give me ten minutes
to say hi to Hannah,

774
00:49:58,128 --> 00:50:02,963
<i>and then I'll come back and</i>
<i>we'll do a little preparation.</i>
Fine.

775
00:50:03,033 --> 00:50:05,263
I'll be back in a minute.

776
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:10,138
I'm gonna wait right here.

777
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:13,309
I'm, you know-

778
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:16,437
I've got some things
in the works.

779
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,481
We have projects,
primarily.

780
00:50:18,548 --> 00:50:20,982
I'm just, uh,

781
00:50:21,051 --> 00:50:23,178
you know,
talking to Eddie.

782
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,915
Would you like, uh-
You want a Halls?

783
00:50:27,491 --> 00:50:31,188
You look very nice.
That's a very nice dress.

784
00:50:31,261 --> 00:50:33,593
Hey. Hey.
Hey.

785
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,800
Thank you.

786
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:41,235
Come in.
Everybody's out back.

787
00:50:41,304 --> 00:50:45,138
Hey.
You remember
the house, right?

788
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:48,268
You understand, I am in
a kind of a business where...

789
00:50:48,345 --> 00:50:50,472
I'm constantly getting
shipments of merchandise-

790
00:50:50,547 --> 00:50:54,643
merchandise that I'm not,
uh, in control of, per se,

791
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:58,210
but merchandise that I'm gonna
try and move off of my shelves
nevertheless.

792
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:01,223
Sam knows what you do
for a living, Dad.

793
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:05,022
Six days a week I'm moving
serious swag outta my store
onto the street,

794
00:51:05,095 --> 00:51:07,928
and I pride myself
on my ability to do this.

795
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,466
<i>The man is good, Samuel.</i>
<i>He's good at what he does.</i>

796
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:15,062
<i>A year ago, this shine</i>
<i>I used to deal with, uh-</i>

797
00:51:15,138 --> 00:51:17,698
<i>Guy's been down on his luck.</i>
<i>He's working at a pants factory.</i>

798
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,971
He comes to me.
He's been manufacturing
slacks, all kinds,

799
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,410
uh, Sansabelts,
Chinos, whatnot.

800
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:26,313
<i>He swiped a carton</i>
<i>of slacks.</i>

801
00:51:26,383 --> 00:51:28,977
<i>The good stuff,</i>
<i>not any of that, uh,</i>
<i>polycotton bullshit.</i>

802
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:32,044
I say, "Fine."
He says, "There is a catch."

803
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,249
Seems these slacks
had been discontinued.

804
00:51:34,324 --> 00:51:38,226
The material they're made out of
has been found to be flammable.

805
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:41,526
The pants
are flammable?
<i>They were flammable.</i>

806
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,032
So who cares?
'Cause usually what that
means is that, uh,

807
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:46,035
it didn't pass
some government regulation,
something like that.

808
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,833
<i>But you're not really</i>
<i>gonna have a problem</i>
<i>with the pants.</i>

809
00:51:48,905 --> 00:51:52,432
<i>So, I buy the carton.</i>
<i>I put the word out</i>
<i>on the street.</i>

810
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:56,309
<i>Good Stuff Leo's</i>
<i>got designer slacks</i>
<i>at a major discount.</i>

811
00:51:56,379 --> 00:52:00,713
The buzz is big.
All of a sudden a lady comes in,
a regular customer of mine.

812
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:04,015
She comes in and she tries on
the slacks.

813
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:07,181
Now this lady has
what you call a...

814
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:09,521
funny kind of a figure.

815
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,721
<i>- Funny-figured?</i>
<i>- Yes. She's, uh-</i>

816
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:16,197
She's funny-figured.
She tries on these slacks.

817
00:52:16,266 --> 00:52:18,131
<i>On her</i>
<i>these slacks look great.</i>

818
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:21,261
<i>They look great, she loves 'em,</i>
<i>she buys a pair.</i>

819
00:52:21,338 --> 00:52:23,738
Two weeks later she tells me
she's never felt better.

820
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:26,867
She's wearing those pants
three, four times a week.

821
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:29,935
I am so moved by her happiness
that I invite her here...

822
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,982
to celebrate Rosh Hashanah
with us just like
we're doing now.

823
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,040
<i>Hannah smoked her fish.</i>

824
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:37,484
<i>I made a couple</i>
<i>of other dishes.</i>

825
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:41,718
<i>Bob and Harry are there.</i>
<i>Cousin Ira is here,</i>
<i>the whole gang.</i>

826
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,817
This lady comes,
let's call her Joyce.

827
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:48,797
Joyce comes and she brings
a package of Kobe steaks
as a thank you.

828
00:52:48,865 --> 00:52:52,232
She's wearing the pants.
And you know what?

829
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:55,738
- She looks great.
<i>- She looked really good.</i>

830
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:57,739
All right. Make fun.
Make all the fun you want,
people.

831
00:52:57,807 --> 00:52:59,968
The fact is,
this woman looks terrific.

832
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:02,568
<i>Those pants, they fit her</i>
<i>like a second skin.</i>

833
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:05,911
<i>We're having a fantastic party.</i>
<i>The food's good.</i>
<i>The company's good.</i>

834
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:09,440
She's kissing me.
She's hugging me.
She's so happy.

835
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,283
Leo, Leo, let me make you
another steak.

836
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:15,222
No, I tell her.
Joyce, I can't.
But the truth is...

837
00:53:15,292 --> 00:53:17,317
that Kobe steak,
it cuts like butter.

838
00:53:17,394 --> 00:53:20,124
I wouldn't mind
another piece of that beef.

839
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:23,030
So she insists.
She goes over and she
fires up the grill.

840
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:26,762
It's one of those grills,
the gas grills like
everybody got now, uh,

841
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,861
<i>with a butane tank</i>
<i>underneath.</i>

842
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:33,273
She fires up the grill,
she turns to me,
she points to the pants,

843
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:38,178
<i>she gives me-</i>
<i>so help me to God-a thumbs up</i>
<i>in appreciation of the pants,</i>

844
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:40,478
when all of a sudden,
Samuel, I don't know-

845
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:44,509
<i>There must have been</i>
<i>a little spark or something,</i>
<i>because that's it.</i>

846
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:47,056
- What?
- Poof!

847
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,483
<i>She explodes.</i>

848
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,495
<i>She explodes, Samuel.</i>
<i>The woman goes up...</i>

849
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,760
in a ball of flames, and I swear
to God I think to myself,

850
00:53:56,833 --> 00:54:00,166
I don't know, at that moment,
it's got to be nothing but...

851
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,171
the pants.

852
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:08,201
<i>So you ask if I've ever</i>
<i>killed someone.</i>

853
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,337
<i>The answer is yes and no,</i>
<i>Samuel.</i>

854
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,816
I once sold a woman a pair
of exploding slacks.

855
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:18,012
Did I know they were
gonna ignite?
Of course not.

856
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:21,057
But to some people...

857
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:25,026
it's as bad as if I pulled
the trigger.

858
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:29,657
<i>Hannah, sweetheart,</i>
<i>when you get a chance...</i>

859
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,667
you'll talk to
your cousin Ira.

860
00:54:31,735 --> 00:54:33,862
He's having
emotional problems.

861
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:23,375
<i>Eddie, if you're reading this,</i>
<i>I'll know you've arrived.</i>

862
00:55:23,453 --> 00:55:26,217
<i>Just remember, the last click</i>
<i>is always in your heart.</i>

863
00:55:26,289 --> 00:55:29,486
<i>Love, Dad.</i>

864
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,128
Mmm. Mmm.

865
00:55:39,202 --> 00:55:41,136
Sam.
Hmm?
What's up?

866
00:55:41,204 --> 00:55:43,138
Are you wearing
some kind of padding?

867
00:55:43,206 --> 00:55:45,504
No, maybe just
pretty thick boxers.

868
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:52,339
Hey.
Why are you wearing
padding around your ass?

869
00:55:52,415 --> 00:55:56,146
I'm not. I'm just-
I just- Like a really thin
layer of foam.

870
00:55:56,219 --> 00:55:58,483
It's nothing.

871
00:55:58,555 --> 00:56:02,616
<i>I have a- I have a very...</i>

872
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:06,219
small, uh, butt.

873
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:11,292
My old girlfriend
used to tease and
ridicule me about it.

874
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,496
<i>You don't find the size</i>
<i>of it to be-</i>

875
00:56:14,571 --> 00:56:17,631
Do you find the size of it
to be silly?

876
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:21,973
This may come as a shock
to you, but I think your
padded ass is silly.

877
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,310
Your real one is just...

878
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:29,944
small.

879
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,953
Oh, yeah?

880
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:57,341
What are you doing here?

881
00:56:57,414 --> 00:57:02,852
Frank, turn the music off.

882
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,851
That's how I'm felling,
Hannah.

883
00:57:06,923 --> 00:57:09,517
Please don't do
this right now.

884
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,856
Who's this guy?

885
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,919
This is Sam.
Sam, this is Frank.

886
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,557
- Sweet 'stache, man.
- Thanks, bro.

887
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:20,034
- You can't be here.
- Are you having sex
with this guy?

888
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,571
Actually-

889
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:29,240
All right. I gotta go.
<i>I don't have to feel bad</i>
<i>about this, you know.</i>

890
00:57:29,312 --> 00:57:33,180
- We're not together anymore.
- Okay, you're right.

891
00:57:33,249 --> 00:57:36,184
This actually works out much
better for me.

892
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:40,088
Good <i>Yontif.</i>

893
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:00,409
<i>What are you doing?</i>

894
00:58:00,477 --> 00:58:04,641
- Reading.
- You should be studying
your Torah portion, man.

895
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:08,810
- I should?
- You know how bad that's gonna
look if you screw that up?

896
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,285
No.

897
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:16,481
You're supposed
to be becoming
a man tomorrow.

898
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:19,585
Now, that's a big deal,
B.J.

899
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:21,960
You mess up during
that ceremony...

900
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:25,000
<i>and your dad is going</i>
<i>to have a heart attack.</i>

901
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,935
- He will?
- Definitely, dude.

902
00:58:30,006 --> 00:58:34,443
<i>Hey, is that girl from your</i>
<i>social studies class</i>
<i>still coming?</i>

903
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,072
<i>The one that you've been</i>
<i>crushing on?</i>
Denise Schneider?

904
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,843
Sweet Denise Schneider.

905
00:58:40,917 --> 00:58:43,943
<i>She's still coming?</i>
Yeah.

906
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:48,354
- You better know that
Torah portion cold.
- Okay.

907
00:58:48,424 --> 00:58:52,292
<i>Now, you get to work,</i>
<i>you lazy little baboon.</i>

908
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,923
I'm just kidding.
All right.

909
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:59,196
<i>Now, I am gonna check</i>
<i>on you in a few, though.</i>

910
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,333
Bye, Sasha.

911
00:59:25,995 --> 00:59:28,190
Sure you want
to do this?

912
00:59:28,264 --> 00:59:30,698
Let's go.

913
00:59:45,548 --> 00:59:47,675
This guy is sick.

914
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,741
Yeah, his choice
of venue...

915
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:51,753
is definitely...

916
00:59:51,821 --> 00:59:53,948
questionable.

917
00:59:54,023 --> 00:59:57,481
Okay, first click.

918
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:18,975
Ahh.
Second click.

919
01:00:19,048 --> 01:00:22,074
One more, baby.
A little bingo here.

920
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:26,383
Give me a little bit
of bingo.

921
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,255
Go check 'em out
downstairs.
All right.

922
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:59,049
<i>Eddie, remember...</i>

923
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:03,718
<i>the last click is always</i>
<i>in your heart.</i>

924
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,126
Oh, boys.

925
01:02:12,195 --> 01:02:14,288
Yes.

926
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:18,265
Oh, yes!
Oh, baby!

927
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:22,498
Whoo!

928
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,009
You doing great,
sweetheart.

929
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,710
Shake your booty there,
B.J. baby.

930
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:39,949
Where you goin', fats?
Need a minute here
to deal with these guys.

931
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:43,514
Come on, little Bernie.

932
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,652
Victor is helping Bernie Jr.
with some moves...

933
01:02:45,728 --> 01:02:47,662
for his bar mitzvah party
tomorrow night.

934
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:50,494
Ah, sweet.
He looks good.
Ah, he's all right.

935
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:54,127
<i>- So, I'm really proud</i>
<i>of you guys.</i>
- You doubted us.

936
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:57,229
<i>Chop, what'd I say when they</i>
<i>wouldn't pay me after</i>
<i>the second safe?</i>

937
01:02:57,306 --> 01:03:00,503
"Veal Chop, those two guys
have nuts the size
of casaba melons.

938
01:03:00,576 --> 01:03:03,101
They're the best."

939
01:03:03,179 --> 01:03:05,272
Choppy was worried that
you weren't the guys.

940
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:09,341
<i>- Hey, I didn't know.</i>
- That's why I am
the boss man, Chop Shop.

941
01:03:09,418 --> 01:03:11,716
That is why
I am the boss.
All right.

942
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,847
<i>You know, uh,</i>
<i>I gotta tell you, though,</i>

943
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:15,891
I'm a little upset
with the two of you.

944
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,586
Why?
<i>Why?</i>

945
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,129
You withheld a very important
piece of information from me.

946
01:03:21,197 --> 01:03:23,563
- What's that?
- You sing!

947
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:27,069
- The guy I buy
my kielbasa from,

948
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:31,266
Yanosh, he tells me
he booked you into his lodge
about a week ago.

949
01:03:31,340 --> 01:03:35,208
- Yes, we do sing a little.
- Hey, let me cut to the chase.

950
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:38,509
Like I said, tomorrow night
I'm throwing Bernie Jr.
his bar mitzvah party.

951
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:41,607
I got Victor lined up
with the dancing-
a couple other surprises.

952
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:44,949
So, I was kinda thinking
here, you know-

953
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:48,787
<i>He looks up to you guys,</i>
<i>with you guys being</i>
<i>safe men and all.</i>

954
01:03:48,858 --> 01:03:51,827
<i>So, maybe if he knew</i>
<i>you were gonna perform</i>
<i>at his bar mitzvah party-</i>

955
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:54,454
make him feel
a little more secure.

956
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:58,990
Sure, man, we'll sing
some songs.
Let's do it.

957
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:02,595
Thanks, guys.
Thank you.

958
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:07,268
Oh, oh, oh. I forgot.
Uhm, there's one last thing.

959
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:09,971
Victor!

960
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,742
<i>All right, Victor, enough!</i>
<i>Turn this crap off.</i>

961
01:04:12,815 --> 01:04:15,579
Like I said,

962
01:04:15,651 --> 01:04:18,245
Bernard Jr. became
a man yesterday.

963
01:04:18,321 --> 01:04:22,348
To celebrate this occasion,
there's a very special gift
I would like to give him.

964
01:04:22,425 --> 01:04:24,791
We can't crack
another safe.

965
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,455
I want you to crack
one more safe.
Please, Bernie.

966
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:30,260
Why? You only cracked
one safe.
Yeah, but it was a good safe.

967
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:34,667
<i>Yeah, but that was only</i>
<i>a test of you abilities,</i>
<i>this one is the kahuna.</i>

968
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:39,606
We'll get you one more safe,
but then we're gonna really have
to break the cord.

969
01:04:39,675 --> 01:04:42,769
<i>It's completely understood.</i>
<i>Now, as luck would have it,</i>

970
01:04:42,845 --> 01:04:48,181
<i>the gift for Bernie Jr.</i>
<i>resides in the office safe</i>
<i>of a man named Good Stuff Leo.</i>

971
01:04:51,954 --> 01:04:54,479
Uh, all right,
look.

972
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:58,049
Let me tell you something,
you big fat bitch.

973
01:04:58,127 --> 01:05:00,357
- Sam.
- Whoa, let me do this.

974
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:03,557
I totally understand
what your kid is going through
right now.

975
01:05:03,633 --> 01:05:05,726
I was pretty awkward
in middle school as well,

976
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,861
and if you want us to sing
at the party, we'll be happy
to perform.

977
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:13,238
But as far as the safes go...
that's it, okay?

978
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:17,336
We're the best, Mr. Gayle.
We gave you the goods
and now we're done.

979
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:22,077
Unlike Mr. Veal Chop here,
we're not your
little cabana boys.

980
01:05:22,151 --> 01:05:24,847
What the fuck
is that supposed-
Chop!

981
01:05:28,791 --> 01:05:32,283
You both are gonna break
into Leo's safe...

982
01:05:32,361 --> 01:05:34,886
and steal a very
special cup for me,

983
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:38,832
because if you don't,
you're both gonna find
yourselves extremely dead.

984
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:41,597
And this time, I am not
fuckin' shitting.

985
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:44,834
I'm sorry, okay?

986
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:47,808
I clearly didn't understand
the whole situation.

987
01:05:47,877 --> 01:05:49,811
It's okay.

988
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,813
She does this thing
with white fish...

989
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,748
where she just kind of
lightly smokes it.

990
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:59,686
It's so, uh-

991
01:05:59,755 --> 01:06:04,249
It's really delicious?
Yeah, it's really
delicious.

992
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:11,962
<i>Thanks to a strange</i>
<i>and fairly awful twist of fate,</i>

993
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:17,495
<i>I now found myself caught</i>
<i>between the two Jewish gangsters</i>
<i>in Providence.</i>

994
01:06:17,573 --> 01:06:19,939
<i>Though I can't say I looked</i>
<i>forward to telling Hannah...</i>

995
01:06:20,009 --> 01:06:23,604
<i>that someone was gonna kill us</i>
<i>if we didn't rob her dad's safe,</i>

996
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:27,012
<i>I hoped, naively perhaps,</i>
<i>that she would understand that...</i>

997
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:30,519
<i>my return to crime was</i>
<i>a situation beyond my control.</i>

998
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:23,797
Okay.
Get a chair. Sam, get a chair.
Sure. Okay.

999
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:27,536
So I've got something
pretty serious
on my mind.

1000
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:30,875
What's up, bro?
Thinking about
leaving town.

1001
01:07:44,593 --> 01:07:47,221
So once I factored in
my desire for warm weather,

1002
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:49,287
I sort of settled
on Key West.

1003
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:52,493
Yeah, good town, Frank.
Lovely country.

1004
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:56,732
Hey, this could be it.

1005
01:07:56,806 --> 01:08:00,071
It's that it?
That's not a cup. That's more
like a shot glass or something.

1006
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,133
I mean, it's a cup.
Essentially, a cup.

1007
01:08:02,211 --> 01:08:04,406
What's that over there?
<i>- That's a cup.</i>

1008
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:07,881
Listen, it's not like
I'm definitely going, man.

1009
01:08:07,950 --> 01:08:11,647
I'm just thinking
about it.
I know, Frank.

1010
01:08:11,720 --> 01:08:14,154
<i>I got it.</i>

1011
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,194
Hey, man.

1012
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:24,221
Uh, Pappy?
Oh, hi! Hi!
Who the fuck are you?

1013
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:28,031
I know who I am, guy,
but what I don't know
is who you are.

1014
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,038
Frank?

1015
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,607
What's up, bro?

1016
01:08:34,677 --> 01:08:37,271
This is the guy
I told you about.
Hannah's new boyfriend.

1017
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:41,282
<i>They beat us to the Cup.</i>

1018
01:08:41,350 --> 01:08:43,375
Okay. What are we
holding here?

1019
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:47,149
You didn't fucking know
you were stealing
the Stanley Cup?

1020
01:08:49,558 --> 01:08:52,083
No, we knew.
Yeah.

1021
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:56,689
<i>- She told me she wasn't</i>
<i>dating thieves anymore.</i>
- I just-

1022
01:08:56,765 --> 01:09:00,792
I guess I always
just assumed
we were the best, man.

1023
01:09:02,872 --> 01:09:04,806
Ah!
Fuck!

1024
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,240
Careful, those slacks
are flammable.

1025
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:18,786
All right.
Good score, guys.

1026
01:09:18,854 --> 01:09:22,312
Great score, man.
Give me some juice.
Ow!

1027
01:09:23,392 --> 01:09:25,087
Ow!

1028
01:09:25,161 --> 01:09:27,823
Ow.
Sweet 'stache.

1029
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:31,663
Thanks, bro.
Let's go, Mitchell.

1030
01:09:33,736 --> 01:09:37,433
Hey! You take good care
of her, all right?

1031
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:40,839
She broke up with me.

1032
01:09:40,910 --> 01:09:42,844
- What?
- Yeah. I told her
I had to crack into...

1033
01:09:42,912 --> 01:09:45,437
her dad's safe and she-
she broke up with me.

1034
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,482
Hey, maybe we should,
you know, leave...

1035
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:52,351
and let these guys
have their time, 'cause-
Wait a second, wait a second.

1036
01:09:52,421 --> 01:09:55,390
<i>It was at that moment</i>
<i>that I thought of a plan.</i>

1037
01:09:55,457 --> 01:09:58,688
Do you guys know
Big Fat Bernie Gayle?

1038
01:09:58,761 --> 01:10:01,127
- I went to high school
with Sasha.
- Who?

1039
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:03,529
<i>- Veal Chop.</i>
- Bernie's intern.

1040
01:10:03,599 --> 01:10:05,760
<i>And for the first time</i>
<i>since I can remember...</i>

1041
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,302
- Can I ask you to hang out
for a minute?
<i>- I had a clear vision...</i>

1042
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:12,739
<i>of the right thing to do.</i>
This idea just kinda ran
through my head.

1043
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,174
Sure, Sam.

1044
01:10:16,879 --> 01:10:20,576
It's '94.
The Rangers win
the championship.

1045
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:22,947
They're taking the Cup
with them all over town.

1046
01:10:23,018 --> 01:10:25,145
Benefits, rallies.
Jamborees.

1047
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,088
The works. One night,
it's the goalie,

1048
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:30,523
Mike Richter, it's his turn
to take the Cup.

1049
01:10:30,593 --> 01:10:32,686
So, he's at the Palladium
dancing away,

1050
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,695
passing the Cup around
like crazy.

1051
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:38,392
He goes to take a shit,
puts the Stanley Cup right
in front of him in the stall.

1052
01:10:38,467 --> 01:10:42,301
Some shine, one of Leo's guys,
happens to be in the city
that night,

1053
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,839
steals the Stanley Cup
from right between
Richter's legs.

1054
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:49,344
So you've set this entire thing
up for us to steal from Leo,

1055
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:53,108
and give the Cup
to Bernie Jr?

1056
01:10:53,182 --> 01:10:55,844
Yes, Samuel. Yes.

1057
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,546
He's a raccoon, this guy.
He's quick.
He's a genius.

1058
01:10:58,621 --> 01:11:01,715
Bernie Jr.
loves hockey.

1059
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:03,724
The kid is obsessed
with it.

1060
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:06,784
Legend has it that
the Cup is sitting
in Leo's safe.

1061
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:09,990
So, that's where
you guys came in.

1062
01:11:10,065 --> 01:11:12,431
I'm gonna have it put
in a Lucite casing,

1063
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,469
present it to Bernie Jr.
after the party...

1064
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,561
in a kinda private-like
type of setting.

1065
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,664
<i>Maybe I could, uh, help</i>
<i>prepare some finger foods.</i>

1066
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,936
Mm. You call
my Lucite guy.

1067
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,274
Hey, he's coming the day
after tomorrow.
Not to worry.

1068
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:27,042
We got it.
The Cup's in the safe.

1069
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:30,108
I love this guy.
He gets upset because...

1070
01:11:30,185 --> 01:11:34,019
he thinks I pay more attention,
uh, to Little Big Fat,
you know.

1071
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,614
Don't you.
Ooh, you big baby.

1072
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:39,490
Yeah, right.
I guess, I guess.
Yeah.

1073
01:11:39,561 --> 01:11:42,826
Beep, beep! I know
you're gonna hate me, but
I really need you out of here.

1074
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:45,696
Guys, be right back. I gotta
deal with my coordinator.

1075
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,759
Hey, how's it going?

1076
01:11:50,472 --> 01:11:54,533
Hey.
You're good people, Sam.

1077
01:11:55,911 --> 01:11:59,972
Come here.
Come here.
Yeah.

1078
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,382
Come on, Eddie.

1079
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:05,511
Come on. Try a little
tenderness, huh?

1080
01:12:05,587 --> 01:12:07,612
Eh, eh.

1081
01:12:12,761 --> 01:12:14,695
Here, take this.

1082
01:12:14,763 --> 01:12:16,788
What the shit is this?
It's nothing.

1083
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:21,359
It's just a little present.
A little present
for me.

1084
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:25,897
Hey, Eduardo.
Huh?

1085
01:12:25,974 --> 01:12:29,842
Whoa. Man!

1086
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:33,177
Oh, Eddie.
These are nice, man.

1087
01:12:33,248 --> 01:12:36,649
Whoa, Big!
Hey, look at the slacks
Eddie gave me.

1088
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:40,655
Oh. Wow! Wow!
Look at that.

1089
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:43,157
Oh, that's a nice
weave, Eddie.
Yeah.

1090
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:45,887
I guess
I'm kinda touched,
you know.

1091
01:12:45,961 --> 01:12:48,623
<i>Danke schön,</i> Eddie.
You're welcome.

1092
01:12:50,733 --> 01:12:53,463
Come here.
Come here.

1093
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,872
There's a lot of love
in this room right now.

1094
01:13:02,778 --> 01:13:05,747
Whoa! Hey!

1095
01:13:05,814 --> 01:13:08,442
Leflore, listen to me.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

1096
01:13:08,517 --> 01:13:10,747
No, no, no.
Listen to me.
That was my last job.

1097
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,515
No, that was not your last job
because this is your last job.

1098
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:17,081
I'm hemming now.
And when the time is right,

1099
01:13:17,159 --> 01:13:19,320
I'm gonna help you open
that tailor shop.

1100
01:13:19,395 --> 01:13:21,488
All right.
You want 'em dead?

1101
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,827
No, I need
these guys alive.

1102
01:13:23,899 --> 01:13:25,924
That's no fun.

1103
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:30,597
I am sensitive to the fact
that it is less enjoyable
for you, but, uh,

1104
01:13:30,672 --> 01:13:33,334
Hannah was romantically involved
with one of them, so-

1105
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:37,311
Big surprise.
Yeah, right. Big surprise.

1106
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:40,906
Can I break something
at least?
Yeah, fine.
Break something.

1107
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:45,545
Only, uh, make it something
that you don't use every day.

1108
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:50,456
The coccyx?
Coccyx? Can't you do
like a shinbone or something?

1109
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:55,122
All right, collarbone.
There you go, baby.
Collarbone.

1110
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,358
You know why I love you.
I'm the best.

1111
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,231
That's right.
'Cause you're the best.
Thanks, Leo.

1112
01:14:00,302 --> 01:14:03,237
I'll speak to you tomorrow.

1113
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,779
<i>From the floor to the ceiling,</i>
<i>how ya feeling?</i>

1114
01:14:13,849 --> 01:14:17,216
From the bris to this,
he can't miss.

1115
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:20,551
From the Wailing Wall
to the social hall...

1116
01:14:20,622 --> 01:14:25,116
to all of y'all,
welcome to Bernie Gayle Jr.'s...

1117
01:14:25,194 --> 01:14:28,163
big b-mitzvah bash.

1118
01:14:28,230 --> 01:14:31,996
Bring it on.

1119
01:14:58,460 --> 01:15:03,397
Hey. What?

1120
01:15:08,737 --> 01:15:12,332
I was actually thinking
about not going
out there tonight, Sam.

1121
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:15,399
Chill out 'cause
it's about that time...

1122
01:15:15,477 --> 01:15:19,004
for the Gayle family
all-stars.

1123
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:22,380
Kicking things off
is the man behind the man...

1124
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:25,352
spreading the Ten Commandments
of love from above.

1125
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:28,014
Nobody laugh
on the baby calf,

1126
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:33,187
show your love
for Ve-e-eal Cho-o-op!

1127
01:15:33,262 --> 01:15:36,129
<i>Come on, baby.</i>

1128
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:45,370
Frank and Mitchell
asked if I wanted...

1129
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,670
to join up with them.

1130
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:52,270
Really?
Yeah.

1131
01:15:52,347 --> 01:15:56,215
Get together
and do some safes.

1132
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:06,256
Veal Chop! Veal Chop!
Veal Chop! Veal Chop!

1133
01:16:06,328 --> 01:16:09,297
Veal Chop! Veal Chop!
Veal Chop!

1134
01:16:09,364 --> 01:16:14,495
Uh, you had a really
good plan, Sam.

1135
01:16:17,506 --> 01:16:22,466
You think they'll- they'll
bring the Cup back to Leo?
Definitely.

1136
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,911
You're telling me that
you took this
from Bernie Gayle's house?

1137
01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:28,882
Yeah. Um-hm.
<i>A-A-And you're giving</i>
<i>it back to me.</i>

1138
01:16:28,951 --> 01:16:31,818
<i>You don't want nothing</i>
<i>in return for it?</i>

1139
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:36,824
Here. Here you go.

1140
01:16:36,892 --> 01:16:41,124
- How did you know
the Cup was at Bernie's?
- I guess, like, intuition?

1141
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:46,133
- Sam told us.
- What?

1142
01:16:46,201 --> 01:16:50,160
Nothing.
That guy, Sam,
he told us.

1143
01:16:50,238 --> 01:16:52,968
Samuel told you to take
the Cup from Bernie Gayle...

1144
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:54,975
and bring it back to me?

1145
01:16:58,413 --> 01:17:03,612
- Yes.
- Oh, shit!

1146
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:06,552
What?

1147
01:17:06,622 --> 01:17:09,182
Leflore.

1148
01:17:09,257 --> 01:17:11,487
I'm taking the car.

1149
01:17:13,428 --> 01:17:15,362
Stand up and wail...

1150
01:17:15,430 --> 01:17:19,764
for Big Fat Bernie Gayle!

1151
01:17:34,249 --> 01:17:39,414
So, hey, I'll just take off.
Okay. Okay.

1152
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:42,582
I may just
go congratulate
Bernie Jr.

1153
01:17:42,658 --> 01:17:45,889
All right.
Okay.

1154
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,952
Hey, do you-
do you wanna-

1155
01:17:48,030 --> 01:17:50,760
What? You want
a hug or something?

1156
01:17:52,434 --> 01:17:54,925
Yeah, it be okay.
Okay.

1157
01:18:11,920 --> 01:18:16,550
Stop.
I stopped wearing
the ass.

1158
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:24,431
You're gonna be fine.

1159
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,071
All right.

1160
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:35,974
Well, I'll see ya.
Okay. I'll see ya.

1161
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:40,914
<i>And finally-</i>

1162
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,974
Can we bring it down,
please?

1163
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:46,646
Shh!
Come on, come on.

1164
01:19:15,016 --> 01:19:18,747
You the man.
You the man.

1165
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:21,186
Who the man?
You the man.

1166
01:19:21,256 --> 01:19:24,521
Tonight,
like a phoenix,

1167
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:27,528
he rises through
the arena floor.

1168
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:35,800
Leflore.

1169
01:19:35,871 --> 01:19:39,898
- I want you to put
the mallet down.
- I can't do that, baby.

1170
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:43,638
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I give to you...

1171
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:46,146
the one and only...

1172
01:19:46,214 --> 01:19:48,648
<i>Little Big Fat himself,</i>

1173
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:53,211
<i>Bernie Gayle Jr!</i>

1174
01:19:57,726 --> 01:20:00,194
Leflore, would you please
listen to me?

1175
01:20:00,262 --> 01:20:04,096
- This is between
me and your dad, Hannah.
- Leflore!

1176
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:16,076
You like this guy?

1177
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:18,408
I really like him a lot.

1178
01:20:21,216 --> 01:20:24,515
All right, baby.
Thanks.

1179
01:20:26,621 --> 01:20:29,522
B.J., yes!

1180
01:20:41,536 --> 01:20:44,471
<i>And now, baby Bernie,</i>
<i>would you grab that...</i>

1181
01:20:44,539 --> 01:20:47,406
<i>special someone</i>
<i>as you take the floor...</i>

1182
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:50,444
<i>for your first dance</i>
<i>as a man.</i>

1183
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:54,039
Hey!
Hey.
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

1184
01:20:54,115 --> 01:20:56,640
<i>would you please help me</i>
<i>welcome the honorable...</i>
Hey.

1185
01:20:56,718 --> 01:21:00,654
<i>Mr. Bernard Gayle</i>
<i>the second.</i>

1186
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,714
<i>Come on, little Bernie.</i>
Did you get the-

1187
01:21:26,481 --> 01:21:28,676
I'm not really
a good dancer.

1188
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:39,321
<i>As Hannah and I...</i>

1189
01:21:39,394 --> 01:21:41,362
<i>swayed on the dance floor,</i>

1190
01:21:41,429 --> 01:21:43,920
<i>I thought about</i>
<i>the last seven days.</i>

1191
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,991
<i>About Little Big Fat,</i>

1192
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,935
<i>who had recently</i>
<i>become a man.</i>

1193
01:21:50,005 --> 01:21:52,166
<i>And Veal Chop,</i>
<i>even though he might suffer...</i>

1194
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:54,174
<i>a minor explosion</i>
<i>in the next few weeks,</i>

1195
01:21:54,242 --> 01:21:56,369
<i>seemed so touched</i>
<i>by his role...</i>

1196
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:58,969
<i>in this Gayle family</i>
<i>celebration.</i>

1197
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:00,981
<i>And Bernie the fat man</i>
<i>who had gotten us...</i>

1198
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,983
<i>into this situation</i>
<i>to steal the Cup...</i>

1199
01:22:03,051 --> 01:22:07,351
<i>that has since been returned</i>
<i>to its rightful owner.</i>

1200
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,356
<i>And though I could no longer</i>
<i>speak for Eddie,</i>

1201
01:22:09,424 --> 01:22:11,722
<i>who had gone off</i>
<i>to fulfill his destiny,</i>

1202
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:14,626
<i>of all things, I think that</i>
<i>right then and there...</i>

1203
01:22:14,696 --> 01:22:17,460
<i>for the first time</i>
<i>in a long time,</i>

1204
01:22:17,532 --> 01:22:20,558
<i>I actually felt safe.</i>

1205
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:46,693
Hey, how are ya?
