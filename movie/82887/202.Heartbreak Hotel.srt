00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,240
<font color="yellow">He'll need one if he has 30 a day!</font>

113
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,780
<font color="white">He wants to go skin-diving</font>
<font color="white">in St Ives.</font>

114
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:18,820
<font color="yellow">It's all extra-curricular. Don't he</font>
<font color="yellow">fancy anything INSIDE the classroom?</font>

115
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:21,500
<font color="white">Mostly the girls, Dad!</font>

116
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:26,140
<font color="yellow">'Ere, I don't want him getting</font>
<font color="yellow">no girl into trouble!</font>

117
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,660
<font color="white">Well, if YOU hadn't,</font>
<font color="lime">I </font><font color="white">wouldn't be here!</font>

118
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,700
<font color="yellow">We don't want any coarse remarks</font>
<font color="yellow">of that nature!</font>

119
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,980
<font color="yellow">I can't believe my ears</font>
<font color="yellow">when I hear kids today!</font>

120
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:45,340
<font color="white">There's nothing wrong! You and Mum</font>
<font color="white">have proved your love wasn't</font>
<font color="white">an infatuation... Silver wedding!</font>

121
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:50,940
<font color="yellow">I still don't want my love-life to</font>
<font color="yellow">be a yardstick! Raymond's only 14!</font>

122
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:58,340
<font color="yellow">When what happened</font>
<font color="yellow">happened to your mother and me,</font>
<font color="yellow">we were mature 16-year-olds.</font>

123
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,620
<font color="yellow">In Highgate Cemetery, it was.</font>

124
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,900
<font color="yellow">But WE had something behind us.</font>

125
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,140
<font color="yellow">The tomb of Karl Marx.</font>

126
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,660
<font color="yellow">No, but your mum had</font>
<font color="yellow">a nice, steady job in Gamages,</font>

127
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:20,340
<font color="yellow">and I had my plastering diploma</font>
<font color="yellow">from borstal.</font>

128
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:27,780
<font color="yellow">Talking of Highgate Cemetery, how's</font>
<font color="yellow">YOUR love-life? </font><font color="white">Oh, least said...</font>
<font color="yellow">Is it still Eddie Risley?</font>

129
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:31,160
<font color="yellow">I've warned you about him.</font>
<font color="yellow">He's a crook!</font>

130
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:36,220
<font color="white">He's straight, Dad! He's just</font>
<font color="white">a tough businessman. </font><font color="yellow">Yeah (!)</font>

131
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:40,660
<font color="white">It isn't fair, people saying</font>
<font color="white">he'd sell his own mother.</font>

132
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:43,380
<font color="lime">I </font><font color="yellow">heard that. </font><font color="white">Who from?!</font>

133
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,540
<font color="yellow">The two blokes</font>
<font color="yellow">who bought his mother.</font>

134
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:52,980
<font color="white">It's no good talking to you.</font>
<font color="white">You've got a blind spot about him.</font>
<font color="yellow">So have you.</font>

135
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,620
<font color="yellow">Giving you a bad time, isn't he?</font>
<font color="white">I don't know where I am with him.</font>

136
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,220
<font color="yellow">You don't half pick 'em, do you?</font>

137
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:06,780
<font color="yellow">You're a bonny girl. You could have</font>
<font color="yellow">anyone you wanted, you could.</font>

138
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:11,300
<font color="yellow">And also, you're not</font>
<font color="yellow">getting any younger - 24.</font>

139
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:16,540
<font color="white">That's not old! </font><font color="yellow">It is</font>
<font color="yellow">for a teenager! And a spinster!</font>

140
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:23,820
<font color="white">Oh, Dad! Things have changed</font>
<font color="white">since your day! Girls don't want</font>
<font color="white">to be tied down so quick.</font>

141
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,620
<font color="white">They see alternatives to marriage.</font>

142
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,360
<font color="yellow">Not in Muswell Hill, they don't.</font>

143
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,220
<font color="white">They've twinned the Odeon!</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm talking about moral standards!</font>

144
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,260
<font color="yellow">What do social commentators know?</font>
<font color="yellow">Nothing about the real world!</font>

145
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:47,860
<font color="yellow">They all live in NW1! Never been</font>
<font color="yellow">further north than Hampstead or</font>
<font color="yellow">further south than Sloane Square!</font>

146
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:53,860

<font color="yellow">Are you wearing a bra?</font>

147
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:58,660
<font color="white">I don't need to, Dad!</font>
<font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

148
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:01,340
<font color="white">My breasts are firm and pliant.</font>

149
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,580
<font color="yellow">Please, Ingrid!</font>

150
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:09,740
<font color="yellow">This isn't St Tropez!</font>
<font color="yellow">It's Slade bleeding Prison!</font>

151
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:16,500
<font color="yellow">The men here would go berserk</font>
<font color="yellow">at the sight of a shin,</font>
<font color="yellow">never mind unfettered knockers!</font>

152
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,860
<font color="white">Dad!</font>

153
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:20,700
<font color="yellow">I'm sorry, but it has to be said.</font>

154
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:27,020
<font color="yellow">You are very naive</font>
<font color="yellow">about the effect your body</font>
<font color="yellow">can have on a shackled male.</font>

155
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,860
<font color="white">Dad, YOU are naive in some ways.</font>

156
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,940
<font color="white">I'm sure no-one's even noticed!</font>

157
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,000
<font color="yellow">Godber?</font>

<font color="yellow">You got any snout?</font>

<font color="lime">No. Would you believe it? </font><font color="yellow">Yeah,</font>

<font color="yellow">I've got things on my mind.</font>
<font color="lime">Like what? </font><font color="yellow">MY business!</font>

169
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,200
<font color="lime">Oh, come on. You've woken me up now.</font>

170
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,300

<font color="lime">That's not like you, Fletch.</font>

172
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:19,220

<font color="lime">Yeah, I know. </font><font color="yellow">14, 19 and 24.</font>

00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:29,940
<font color="lime">Why the gap between each?</font>

<font color="lime">How? </font><font color="yellow">Well, I had to keep going</font>
<font color="yellow">in prison for five years, didn't I?</font>

<font color="lime">Lovely eyes. Big and blue.</font>

182
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:09,540
<font color="yellow">Oh, yeah. </font><font color="lime">And a nice smile,</font>

<font color="lime">saying this...</font>

184
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:21,320
<font color="lime">..but I couldn't help overhearing</font>
<font color="lime">a bit of what you said.</font>
<font color="lime">Most of us did.</font>

00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:35,340

<font color="yellow">Not that SHE'D believe it.</font>

188
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:39,580
<font color="lime">How can YOU be sure?</font>
<font color="yellow">I bought two off him.</font>

189
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:46,060
<font color="yellow">They weren't much cop either.</font>
<font color="yellow">He spelt Citroen with an S.</font>

<font color="yellow">I'm playing draughts.</font>

201
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,580
<font color="white">It IS important.</font>
<font color="white">I wouldn't ask otherwise.</font>

202
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,400
<font color="yellow">So is THIS, innit?</font>

203
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,340
<font color="yellow">Duty calls.</font>

204
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:13,040
<font color="yellow">We'll have to call it a draw.</font>
<font color="yellow">Half each.</font>

205
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,780
<font color="white">Sorry to disturb you in association</font>
<font color="white">hour. </font><font color="yellow">That's OK. It's only draughts.</font>

206
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:29,840
<font color="white">Not your game as a rule, is it? </font><font color="yellow">No.</font>
<font color="yellow">There's not much else to do now.</font>

207
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,700
<font color="yellow">Look at the Ping-Pong ball.</font>

208
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,700
<font color="white">Oh, I am sorry! It is a mess. </font><font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

209
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:40,180
<font color="white">Anyhow, I wanted a quiet word.</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm all ears.</font>

210
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,820
<font color="white">Do you know where Godber is?</font>

211
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:47,980
<font color="yellow">He'll be at one of his poxy evening</font>

<font color="yellow">Is he? The lad? What's he done?</font>

213
00:17:53,340 --> 00:18:01,120
<font color="white">He's attacked a prisoner in the</font>
<font color="white">kitchen. He attacked Jackdaw with</font>

214
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,400
<font color="white">It's quite true! It was a severe and</font>
<font color="white">unprovoked attack, the officer said.</font>

215
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,900
<font color="yellow">I don't believe it! I know</font>
<font color="yellow">Jackdaw gets on everybody's nerves,</font>
<font color="yellow">but Lennie's a passive sort of boy.</font>

216
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:20,620
<font color="yellow">He wouldn't hurt a fly!</font>
<font color="white">I thought you might throw some light</font>
<font color="white">on the matter.</font>

217
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:27,100
<font color="yellow">I dunno... He seemed</font>

<font color="yellow">At lunchtime he was cheerful.</font>

218
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:32,140
<font color="yellow">But Mr Pringle did slip on a bit</font>
<font color="yellow">of orange peel and hurt his back,</font>

219
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,700
<font color="yellow">so we was ALL cheerful.</font>

220
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:39,700

<font color="white">Godber is in trouble!</font>

221
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:47,340
<font color="white">It's so irrational, you see.</font>
<font color="white">I like that lad, you know.</font>
<font color="white">I think he shows a lot of promise.</font>

222
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,900
<font color="yellow">It's the system, innit?</font>
<font color="yellow">It's turning an affable young lad</font>
<font color="yellow">into a violent criminal!</font>

223
00:18:53,900 --> 00:19:01,180
<font color="yellow">You're sitting on a volcano</font>
<font color="yellow">which could at any time</font>
<font color="yellow">erupt into violence and mayhem!</font>

224
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:06,420
<font color="white">Fletcher, you've got your finger</font>
<font color="white">on the pulse. How can we avert this?</font>

225
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:11,380
<font color="yellow">Well, there is one thing you could</font>
<font color="yellow">do to postpone the holocaust.</font>

226
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,200
<font color="white">What? </font><font color="yellow">You could indent for</font>
<font color="yellow">another Ping-Pong ball. </font><font color="white">Fletcher!</font>

227
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:36,300
<font color="yellow">Well then?</font>

228
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,060
<font color="lime">Well then, what? </font><font color="yellow">I heard.</font>

229
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:43,620
<font color="lime">Heard what? </font><font color="yellow">I heard you hit Jackdaw</font>
<font color="yellow">with a ladle.</font>

230
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,760
<font color="lime">Heard right then, didn't you?</font>

231
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,440
<font color="yellow">Must've had your reasons. </font><font color="lime">I did.</font>
<font color="yellow">Ain't you going in the cooler then?</font>

232
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,460
<font color="lime">No. </font><font color="yellow">Lucky lad! </font><font color="lime">Lucky, am I?!</font>

233
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,760
<font color="yellow">Yeah! Assault, innit,</font>
<font color="yellow">ladling a fellow prisoner?!</font>

234
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,900
<font color="yellow">Automatic cooler offence, ladling.</font>

235
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:10,380
<font color="lime">I just got loss of privileges, due</font>
<font color="lime">to the mitigating circumstances.</font>

236
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,800
<font color="yellow">You must have had</font>
<font color="yellow">mitigating circumstances!</font>

237
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,040
<font color="yellow">Look, you don't HAVE to tell me.</font>

238
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:32,020
<font color="yellow">You don't HAVE to say what drove</font>
<font color="yellow">you to launch into Jackdaw with</font>
<font color="yellow">a deadly weapon, to wit, one ladle!</font>

239
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:36,520
<font color="lime">I won't then. I'd rather not.</font>
<font color="yellow">Oh, I see.</font>

240
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:38,880
<font color="yellow">I see!</font>

241
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:46,720
<font color="yellow">It hasn't occurred to you that your</font>
<font color="yellow">hitherto blameless record is due</font>
<font color="yellow">in no small part to yours truly.</font>

242
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:54,540
<font color="yellow">I'm only the guy who showed you</font>
<font color="yellow">the ropes, kept you on the rails,</font>
<font color="yellow">loaned you his soft toilet-paper!</font>

243
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,580
<font color="lime">I'm not ungrateful! Every time</font>
<font color="lime">I go to the bog, I'm not ungrateful.</font>

244
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:08,260
<font color="yellow">Having eavesdropped into MY private</font>
<font color="yellow">life, don't you think it's time</font>
<font color="yellow">I knew something about yours?!</font>

245
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:14,960
<font color="lime">I got bad news!</font>
<font color="lime">Jackdaw took the mick, so I hit him</font>
<font color="lime">when my mind was disturbed!</font>

246
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,500
<font color="yellow">News? </font><font color="lime">Yeah!</font>

247
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,920
<font color="yellow">What news?!</font>

248
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,640
<font color="yellow">Oh.</font>

249
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,860
<font color="yellow">It's a Dear John letter. </font><font color="lime">In my case</font>
<font color="lime">it's Dear Lennie. </font><font color="yellow">Naturally.</font>

250
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:54,280
<font color="yellow">Yours, but not forever, Denise, eh?</font>
<font color="lime">That's right.</font>

251
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,100
<font color="yellow">So it's the DEMISE of Denise!</font>

252
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,720
<font color="lime">That's not funny, Fletcher!</font>

253
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,040
<font color="yellow">Was that a joke?</font>
<font color="lime">Not what </font><font color="white">I </font><font color="lime">call a joke!</font>

254
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,500
<font color="yellow">Don't you think I've seen it happen</font>
<font color="yellow">hundreds of times? It's inevitable.</font>

255
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:14,820
<font color="yellow">At least she's honest. They're all</font>
<font color="yellow">at it like knives while we're here!</font>

256
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:22,140
<font color="lime">But her main concern</font>
<font color="lime">in her last letter was whether</font>
<font color="lime">to get a budgerigar or a canary!</font>

257
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:25,500
<font color="yellow">In your future life together?</font>
<font color="lime">Yeah.</font>

258
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,000
<font color="yellow">One decision you won't have to make.</font>
<font color="lime">I suppose not.</font>

259
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,380
<font color="yellow">Look, I know it's only</font>
<font color="yellow">academic now, but...</font>

260
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:39,140
<font color="yellow">..speaking personally,</font>
<font color="yellow">from personal experience...</font>

261
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:43,640
<font color="yellow">..I would say that always,</font>
<font color="yellow">by and large...</font>

262
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,980
<font color="yellow">..I would plump</font>
<font color="yellow">for a budgerigar.</font>

263
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,280
<font color="lime">Oh.</font>

264
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,980
<font color="lime">Why? </font><font color="yellow">They're more friendly,</font>
<font color="yellow">and canaries are prone to draughts,</font>
<font color="yellow">you know.</font>

265
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:00,800
<font color="yellow">I think it's the angle of the tail.</font>

266
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:09,020
<font color="yellow">I speak from experience,</font>
<font color="yellow">'cos we had a canary once.</font>
<font color="yellow">Surly little bleeder!</font>

267
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:13,700
<font color="lime">As you say, it's academic.</font>
<font color="yellow">Yeah. He's dead now.</font>

268
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:21,380
<font color="yellow">So, Denise has had... Someone's...</font>
<font color="yellow">There's another man, is there?</font>
<font color="yellow">Do you know him?</font>

269
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:27,500
<font color="lime">His name's Kenneth.</font>
<font color="lime">He's in the merchant navy,</font>
<font color="lime">so there's no contest.</font>

270
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:34,700
<font color="yellow">I see. Jolly Jack Tar,</font>
<font color="yellow">the sailor with the navy-blue eyes</font>
<font color="yellow">and all the gold braid?</font>

271
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,220
<font color="yellow">Sun shines out of his port-hole,</font>
<font color="yellow">I know.</font>

272
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:43,340
<font color="yellow">Don't worry, it's only temporary.</font>

273
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:49,900
<font color="yellow">Once he's at sea,</font>
<font color="yellow">you'll be out with Denise,</font>
<font color="yellow">and he'll be up the Persian Gulf.</font>

274
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:55,560
<font color="yellow">Then you can just assume your</font>
<font color="yellow">rightful place in her affections.</font>

275
00:23:55,560 --> 00:24:01,680
<font color="yellow">It's just temporary.</font>
<font color="lime">I don't think so. </font><font color="yellow">No sweat.</font>
<font color="lime">She's married him.</font>

276
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,040
<font color="yellow">She's what?</font>

277
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,940
<font color="lime">Last Saturday.</font>
<font color="lime">She thought I should know.</font>

278
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,760
<font color="yellow">Married him.</font>

279
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,680
<font color="lime">The Cross Keys did them proud -</font>
<font color="lime">pate and salad.</font>

280
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,200
<font color="yellow">Well, I'm appalled.</font>

281
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,040
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say.</font>

282
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,740
<font color="yellow">Pate and salad!</font>

283
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:35,500
<font color="white">Mum's coming next month.</font>
<font color="white">She would have come today,</font>
<font color="white">only the doctor forbade it.</font>

284
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:42,260
<font color="white">He said she'd be a fool to herself.</font>
<font color="yellow">Nothing serious?</font>
<font color="white">Just something going round.</font>

285
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:46,980
<font color="white">Marion ain't with Timothy Whites</font>
<font color="white">no longer.</font>

286
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:51,420
<font color="yellow">Ain't she? Dispensed</font>
<font color="yellow">with her services, have they?</font>

287
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:56,480
<font color="white">She's got a job selling shirts.</font>
<font color="white">She shows them round the offices.</font>

288
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,860
<font color="yellow">Makes a change</font>
<font color="yellow">from showing her knickers.</font>

289
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:03,180
<font color="white">She's found another flat</font>
<font color="white">in Maida Vale,</font>

290
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:08,220
<font color="white">and what you'll be most glad to hear</font>
<font color="white">is that me and Eddie have split up.</font>

291
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,400
<font color="yellow">Have you? Not before time, girl!</font>

292
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:17,960
<font color="yellow">That's a great relief to us all.</font>
<font color="lime">Yeah, we was very worried</font>
<font color="lime">about that liaison.</font>

293
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:22,220
<font color="yellow">Do you mind?! Get on</font>
<font color="yellow">with your own visit, please!</font>

294
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:27,360
<font color="yellow">Sorry, Mrs Godber. Haven't you got</font>
<font color="yellow">any news from the home front, dear?</font>

295
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,140
<font color="white">Well, I can't think</font>
<font color="white">of anything to say. It's like</font>
<font color="white">visiting people in hospital.</font>

296
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:37,960
<font color="yellow">Force yourself, love.</font>
<font color="cyan">Here, here, here!</font>

<font color="cyan">There will be no fratricide here.</font>

301
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,620
<font color="yellow">That's what I told him.</font>
<font color="yellow">So if you'll excuse us, Godber...</font>

302
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:03,680
<font color="lime">Sorry, Fletch. Sorry, miss.</font>
<font color="white">That's all right.</font>

303
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,880
<font color="yellow">So, you've given Eddie the big E.</font>
<font color="yellow">That's good.</font>

304
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,620
<font color="yellow">Stick to what I tell you</font>
<font color="yellow">in future, right?</font>

305
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:16,540
<font color="white">I do! Ain't you noticed how discreet</font>
<font color="white">I am today? </font><font color="yellow">What do you mean?</font>

306
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:23,660

<font color="yellow">I don't get you.</font>

307
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:27,520
<font color="white">Oh, Dad, look! I'm wearing a bra!</font>

308
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,360

00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,460
<font color="yellow">Ping-Pong balls are scarce. I'll</font>

312
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,900

315
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:18,260

319
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:42,380

323
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:58,580
<font color="lime">So you think then, that if a girl</font>

324
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:03,360
<font color="yellow">Yeah, if she's a human being.</font>
<font color="yellow">Any human being would.</font>

325
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,660
