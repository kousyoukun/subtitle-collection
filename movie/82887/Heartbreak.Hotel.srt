1
00:00:09,176 --> 00:00:26,610
所以安静，小宝贝，不要哭，你知道你的爸爸一定会死。
So hush, little baby don't you cry you know your daddy's bound to die.

2
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:43,377
但我所有的考验，主啊很快就会结束
But all my trials, lord soon be over

3
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,410
乔。

00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:30,132
——荣耀。荣耀,荣耀。

5
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:41,977
哈利路亚，他的真理正在行进

他的真理在前进

好吧。嗯。

服务员!

11
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,783
我们需要一些音乐。

00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:48,919
对我刻薄残忍，干杯。

-但是爱我吧-妈妈!

18
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:08,563
你想把音乐关小点吗?我们明天还要上学。
You want to turn down the music? We've got school tomorrow.

19
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:14,236
约翰尼,pammie,嗨。这是史蒂夫。

-乞讨和偷窃。-只是去感受。
- Beg and steal. - Just to feel.

29
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:47,853
什么?
What?

30
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,439
我不想再跳舞了。
I don't feel like dancing anymore.

31
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:53,316
-那我们上楼吧——不,不。

32
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,820
好吧,什么?
Well, what?

33
00:03:56,862 --> 00:04:00,282
它是不正确的。
It's not right.

34
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,325
我觉得你该回家了。
I think you should go home.

35
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:07,289
-你真的想让我去吗?-我要你走。它是不正确的。
- You really want me to go? - I want you to go. It's not right.

36
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,460
——好!-哦，好孤独
- Fine! - Oh, so lonely

37
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:30,562
因为我觉得我的灵魂在燃烧推动着我带我走得更高我看到我的灵魂在燃烧。
'Cause I feel my soul on fire pushin' me on takin' me higher I see my soul on fire.

38
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,607
谁能抗拒这样的感觉。
Who can resist a feeling like this.

39
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,364
灵魂着火了。
Soul on fire.

40
00:04:46,912 --> 00:04:49,956
灵魂着火了。
Soul on fire.

41
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:02,636
哇!伙计，我们今天准备好了，不是吗?
Whoa! Man, we're ready for today, aren't we?

42
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:05,180
你在开玩笑吧。你知道他们又要裁我们了。
You gotta be kiddin'. You know they're gonna cut us again.

43
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:09,017
你了吗?我们比以前踢得更好了。我们踢。
Are you whacked? We play better than ever. We kick.

44
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,437
他们会凭空找个狗屁借口。
They're gonna pull some kind of bullshit excuse right out of left field.

45
00:05:12,521 --> 00:05:16,149
-去年是什么?——着装。我们不合群。
- What was it last year? - Dress code. We didn't fit in.

46
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,527
好吧，那我们就自保吧。
All right, so we cover our asses.

47
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:22,864
-我们要让这些人找不到任何借口。-是的。
- We make it so these guys can't come up with any excuses. - Yeah.

48
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:25,951
你哥哥还在泰勒燕尾服公司工作吗?
Your brother still work at Taylor tux?

49
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:30,080
是的。为什么?哦,不,约翰。不可能。
Yeah. Why? Oh, no, John. No way.

50
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,706
猴子西装。不可能。
Monkey suits. No way.

51
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,251
——没有。他是对的。-拜托，伙计们。
- No way. He's right. - Come on, you guys.

52
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,045
这个才艺表演是我们唯一能玩的地方。
This talent show is the only place we could play, man.

53
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:39,941
我们已经连续三年被裁了。你知道会有多少人去吗?
Three years in a row we've been cut. You know how many people are gonna be there?

54
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,842
约翰!早餐!
John! Breakfast!

55
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,387
我要走了。以后再见。
I gotta go. See ya later.

56
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,597
-普通38码，伙计。——38普通。
- Thirty-eight regular, man. - Thirty-eight regular.

57
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,939
糖味在哪里?
Where are the sugar smacks?

58
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,318
你最近营养不足。
You're not getting enough nutrition lately.

59
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,197
吃那些糖衣垃圾会堵塞你的血液。
Eating that sugarcoated crap clogs your blood.

60
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,784
我们没糖了?
We out of sugar smacks?

61
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:11,913
-你们俩是怎么回事?-你有负罪感吗?
- What is it with you two? - You feeling guilty about something?

62
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:14,040
-你说什么?-你听到了。
- What did you say? - You heard me.

63
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:20,630
为什么每次我想做点好事…你要把它扭曲成自私和卑鄙的东西吗?
Why is it every time I try to do something nice... You've got to twist it into something selfish and mean?

64
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,424
我看到什么就说什么。
I call 'em like I see 'em.

65
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,594
-我不喜欢你看他们的方式-我也是，妈
- I don't like the way you see 'em. - Me neither, ma.

66
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,723
我讨厌你评论我的私生活。这是我的事。
I'm sick of you commenting on my private life. It is my business.

67
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:36,313
一旦你的私生活开始干扰我和帕米的生活…那它也变成我的事了。
As soon as your private life starts interfering with my life and pammie's life... Then it becomes my business too.

68
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,571
一天又一天，我越来越困惑。
Day after day I'm more confused.

69
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:52,078
然而我在倾盆大雨中寻找光明。
Yet I look for the light through the pouring rain.

70
00:06:53,872 --> 00:07:03,381
你知道这是一场我讨厌输的比赛，我感到压力很大。
You know that's a game that I hate to lose, and I'm feelin' the strain.

71
00:07:03,465 --> 00:07:05,383
真可惜。
Ain't it a shame.

72
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:08,845
哦，给我节奏，男孩们，解放我的灵魂。
Oh, give me the beat, boys and free my soul.

73
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,143
和渐渐疏远……
And drift away...

74
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,865
-她很好，不是吗?-哦,是的。
- She's good, isn't she? - Oh, yes.

75
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,871
这太酷了，伙计。
This is so cool, man.

76
00:07:34,913 --> 00:07:38,583
她在演鲍勃·迪伦，那些蠢货还不知道呢。
She's playing Bob Dylan, and those bozos don't even know it.

77
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:42,671
我们赢越南战争的机会比和那样的女孩在一起要大得多。
We got a better chance of winning the Vietnam war than making it with a girl like that.

78
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,298
闭嘴。
Shut up.

79
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:49,010
优秀的,贝丝。
Excellent, Beth.

80
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:53,640
-是德彪西吗?——没有。一位不知名的美国作曲家。
- Was that debussy? - No. An obscure American composer.

81
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,434
哦,是的。好,祝贺你。
Oh, yes. Well, congratulations.

82
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,354
周六下午彩排时见。
We'll see you at rehearsal Saturday afternoon.

83
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,022
好的,谢谢你。
Okay, thank you.

84
00:08:01,106 --> 00:08:05,026
约翰尼·沃尔夫……和wolfepack。
Johnny wolfe... And the wolfepack.

85
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:09,864
嗨。这是我写的一首歌。叫做"灵魂燃烧"
Hi. This is a song I wrote. It's called “soul on fire.”

86
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:23,420
灵魂在燃烧灵魂在燃烧。
Soul on fire soul on fire now.

87
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,088
哈!
Huh!

88
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:34,931
有件事让我很伤心我说的是那场血腥的战争。
There's somethin' that's hurtin' me I'm talkin' about that bloody war.

89
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:40,562
一个国家的孩子正在死去。
Where children are dyin' in a country.

90
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,440
那不能再多了。
That can't take much more.

91
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,735
这是一场生存之战。
It's a fight for survival.

92
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:49,738
如果我独自战斗
And if I fight all alone

93
00:08:51,865 --> 00:08:53,867
我要打败所有的对手。
I'm gonna beat every rival.

94
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:56,202
停止它!我说，住手!
Stop it! Stop it, I say!

95
00:08:56,286 --> 00:09:02,500
不会放手，因为我感觉我的灵魂在燃烧
Won't let go 'cause I feel my soul on fire...

96
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:08,048
非常感谢，沃尔夫先生。
Thank you very much, Mr. Wolfe.

97
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,469
就是这样,男人吗?你不让我们把话说完?
That's it, man? You're not gonna let us finish?

98
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,472
抱歉，但我们觉得歌词不太好。
I'm sorry, but we find the lyrics objectionable.

99
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,475
对象……啊,来吧。
Object... ah, come on.

100
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,894
去年你说这是着装要求。
Last year you said it was the dress code.

101
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:23,313
一年前，你说她们的头发太长了。
A year before that, you said their hair was too long.

102
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,817
前年，你说我们要在合唱团上一学期的课才有资格。
The year before that, you said we had to take a semester of that glee club to qualify.

103
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:30,820
你其实是说你不喜欢摇滚。
What you're really saying is that you don't like rock 'n' roll.

104
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:34,657
那不是真的。去年，米奇·恩格尔唱了一首摇滚歌曲。
That's not true. Last year, Mitch engle sang a rock song.

105
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,453
他在木匠旁边唱《靠近你》。那不是摇滚。
He sang “close to you” by the carpenters. That's not rock 'n' roll.

106
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,997
——沃尔夫先生!——我很抱歉。
- Mr. Wolfe! - I'm sorry.

107
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:45,126
我们为此付出了很多努力。
We worked really hard for this.

108
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:49,422
这些礼服都是租来的。只要你能给我们一次机会。
We rented these tuxes and all. If you would just give us a chance.

109
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,966
——我很抱歉。-约翰，没事的。
- I'm sorry. - John, that's all right, man.

110
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,968
求你了，先生，给我一个机会。
Please, sir, just a chance.

111
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,347
请离开舞台。我们还得继续试镜。
Please get off the stage. We have to continue with the auditions.

112
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,141
没事的，伙计。没关系。
It's all right, man. It's all right.

113
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:02,352
别担心。
Don't worry about it.

114
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:05,146
——为什么?——谢谢。
- Why? - Thank you.

115
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,190
邦妮·罗文三人组。
The Bonnie Rowan trio.

116
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,866
你不讨厌每天晚上打扫这个地方吗?
Don't you hate cleaning this place up every night?

117
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,327
反正也没人来过这里。
I mean, no one ever comes here anyway.

118
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:24,124
妈妈觉得有一天会有人来做客。
Mom figures we might get a guest someday.

119
00:10:24,207 --> 00:10:26,835
我猜这地方让她想起了爸爸。
I guess this place reminds her of dad.

120
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,588
我听说他有了新家庭。
I heard he's got a new family and everything.

121
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:33,758
帕米，那不是真的。
Pammie, that's not true.

122
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,594
爸爸不是那种想要家庭的人。
Dad's not the kind of guy who wants a family.

123
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:39,180
如果他是，他就会回来和我们在一起。
If he was, he'd be back here with us.

124
00:10:39,222 --> 00:10:42,851
对吧?对吧?
Right? Right?

125
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:51,401
-嗨。妈，地板是湿的。
- Hi. - Ma, the floor's wet.

126
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,403
好吧。你可以把它收起来了。
Okay. You can put that away.

127
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,405
——走吧。-我们要去哪里?
- Let's go. - Where're we going?

128
00:10:55,446 --> 00:11:00,034
-我们要去露天影院看埃尔维斯的双场演出。-帕米要学习。
- We're going to an Elvis double feature at the drive-in. - Pammie's got to study.

129
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:03,580
-她可以在后座学习。-为什么我们一定要看猫王的电影?
- She can study in the backseat. - Why do we have to see an Elvis movie?

130
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:07,500
为什么我们看不到一些很酷的东西?我们去看教父吧。
Why can't we see something cool? Let's go see the godfather.

131
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:10,420
像你这么大的孩子能从国王那里学到很多。
A boy your age can learn a lot from the king.

132
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:14,007
他不再是国王了。他很久以前就失去了。
He isn't the king anymore. He lost that a long time ago.

133
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:17,385
-他仍然是国王。-我要告诉你多少次?
- He is still the king. - How many times I gotta tell ya?

134
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,721
他的头发满是油脂。
His hair is full of oil and grease.

135
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:22,724
他脸上都是毛茸茸的小羊排。
He's got big ol' hairy lamb chops on his face.

136
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:26,436
他所有的歌都是关于夏威夷的。他拍的电影很烂。
All his songs are about Hawaii. He makes lousy movies.

137
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,273
而且他吉他弹得很烂，妈妈。皮特·汤森德会浪费他的。
And he sucks at guitar, mom. Pete townshend would waste him.

138
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,027
告诉我。像我这样的人能从他身上学到什么?
Tell me. What is a guy like me gonna learn from a guy like that?

139
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:39,240
曾几何时，每个男人都想成为猫王。
There was a time when every guy wanted to be Elvis.

140
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:43,620
如果你想从猫王身上学点什么……注意他对待女人的方式。
If you want to learn something from Elvis... Watch the way he treats women.

141
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:48,124
你会让学校里的每个女孩都想和你约会。
You'll have every girl at school wanting a date with you.

142
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,126
来吧。来吧,pammie。
Come on. Come on, pammie.

143
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:52,962
来吧。它会很有趣。
Come on. It'll be fun.

144
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:00,386
嘿,你,鬓角。下面有个小妞想听你唱歌。
Hey, you, sideburns. I got a chick down there wants to hear you sing.

145
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:05,600
-对不起，先生，我…——这是纯粹的。
- I'm sorry, sir, I... - It's pure.

146
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:08,436
纯的。
Pure.

147
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:10,855
什么?
What?

148
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,942
猫王。
Elvis.

149
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:21,658
他是那么纯洁，那么干净，就像……像乳白色的肥皂泡沫，上面覆盖着甜甜的奶油。
He's so pure, so clean, like... Like ivory soap suds covered with sweet cream.

150
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,706
这是我听你说过的最老套的话了。
That's about the corniest thing I've ever heard you say.

151
00:12:28,831 --> 00:12:32,001
——嗯,抢劫。——纯粹的。
- Well, heist. - Pure.

152
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:37,715
你爸爸有点像猫王。
You know, your dad was a little like Elvis.

153
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:43,596
——没有。是他吗?——嗯。
- No. Was he? - Mm-hmm.

154
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:51,521
有一次，我们结婚八周年纪念的时候…你爸爸买了艘新划艇，爱尔兰之雾。
You know, once, for our eighth wedding anniversary... Your dad got this new rowboat, the Irish mist.

155
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,650
我们在月光下乘船去了凉亭。
We took it out for a moonlight sail to the gazebo.

156
00:12:55,733 --> 00:13:03,324
我们喝了啤酒，吃了披萨……我们就在凉亭里做爱了。
And we had beer and pizza... And we made love right there in the gazebo.

157
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:05,493
啊,来吧。
Ah, come on.

158
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:09,038
我们确实偶尔做爱。
Well, we did occasionally make love.

159
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,041
这是正常的。你以为你是哪来的?
It's normal. Where in the hell do you think you came from?

160
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:16,838
我知道。但现在我每次出海，都会想起你们俩一起玩。
I know. But now every time I take a boat ride, I'm gonna think of you two goin' at it.

161
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,340
噢。
Oooh.

162
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:25,847
总之，在我们做爱之后…-他拿着他的吉他…-爸爸弹吉他?
Anyway, after we make love... - He gets his guitar... - Dad played guitar?

163
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:36,316
不。没有，但他自学了三个和弦……就为了给我唱我最爱的猫王之歌《爱我》
No. No, but he taught himself three chords... Just so he could sing me my favorite Elvis song, “love me.”

164
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:44,407
然后他开始唱歌，他的声音很平淡……沙哑的，就像我有时听到你唱歌一样。
And he starts singing, and his voice is real flat... And gravelly, like when I hear you singing sometimes.

165
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,534
——谢谢。——不!
- Thanks. - No!

166
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:53,249
但那是真的，是真的……这真的很有意义。它是真实的…
But it was, it was real... It was real meaningful. It was real...

167
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,295
它是如此美丽。
It was so beautiful.

168
00:13:57,378 --> 00:14:00,631
我都快哭出来了。
You know, I almost started to cry.

169
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:11,184
我有……我俯身给了他一个拥抱。把吉他撞进水里。
I had... I leaned over to give him a hug... And knocked the guitar into the water.

170
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,603
它飘走了。
It floated away.

171
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,688
我们再也没有拿回来。
We never got it back.

172
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,733
我猜这有点毁了周年纪念，对吧?
Guess it kinda ruined the anniversary, huh?

173
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:32,163
我一直以为……你知道，如果我当时把那把吉他留下…我可能挽救了我们的婚姻。
I always thought... You know, if I'd just saved that guitar... I might've saved our marriage.

174
00:14:38,044 --> 00:14:39,962
我永远不可能像猫王那样。
I could never be like Elvis.

175
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:44,467
-为什么不呢，亲爱的?-我不能留好鬓角。
- Why not, honey? - I can't grow good sideburns.

176
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:48,721
你是做什么的?-从事汽车配件工作。为什么?
- What do you do for a living? - Work in auto accessories. Why?

177
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:53,434
我唱歌是有报酬的，我觉得你应该为我做任何事。
I usually get paid for singin', and I figure you oughta do whatever you do for me.

178
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,479
给我的车装一套新的座套怎么样?
So how about putting a new set of seat covers on my car?

179
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,273
为什么,当然,鬓角。你想要什么颜色?
Why, sure, sideburns. What color you want?

180
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:03,152
我觉得他是黄色的，你说呢?
I figure his color's yellow, don't you?

181
00:15:03,236 --> 00:15:06,072
你相信这个吗?这太假了。
You believe this? This is so fake.

182
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,992
——看它。-我看不下去了
- Watch it. - I can't watch it.

183
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,300
强尼，你的吉他怎么会在这里?
Johnny, what's your guitar doing here?

184
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,970
今天有个试镜。我们得到削减。
There was an audition today. We got cut.

185
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:32,682
哦。你想谈谈吗?
Oh. Do you want to talk about it?

186
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:39,856
是的。我去哄帕米睡觉。
Yeah. Let me just put pammie to bed.

187
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,858
好吧。
Okay.

188
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:48,823
-帕米，我把灯关了。——没有。
- Pammie, I'm gonna turn out this light. - No.

189
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,033
-就今晚。-不，拜托。
- Just for tonight. - No, come on.

190
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,328
你知道黑暗的作用。
You know what dark does.

191
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:59,917
- Pam。-他们出来的时候是黑暗的。黏糊糊的灵魂吸吮者。
- Pam. - Dark's when they come out. The slimy soul suckers.

192
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:02,545
-那是个童话。——不是!
- That's a fairy tale. - Is not!

193
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:06,841
露西·切斯威克的表妹被一个黏糊糊的吸血鬼抓走了。
Lucy cheswick's cousin got taken by a slimy soul sucker.

194
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:10,094
露西·切斯威克的表妹死于肺炎。
Lucy cheswick's cousin died of pneumonia.

195
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:22,732
没有。他们停电了。一个黏糊糊的吸魂者从黑暗中渗出…把它五英尺长的锋利指甲塞进露西表妹的嘴里……
Did not. Their electricity went out... And a slimy soul sucker oozed out of the darkness... Put its five-foot sharp fingernails into Lucy's cousin's mouth...

196
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:27,612
从里面挖出她的灵魂。
Reached way down inside and scooped out her soul.

197
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:31,073
你相信吗?
And you believe that?

198
00:16:31,157 --> 00:16:34,702
她死了，不是吗?
Well, she's dead, isn't she?

199
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:40,291
你知道，我睡觉的时候关灯。他们怎么不懂我?
You know, I sleep with my lights off. How come they don't get me?

200
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:43,961
黏糊糊的吸血鬼只杀小女孩。
Slimy soul suckers only kill little girls.

201
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,548
对了，我忘了。我真笨。
That's right, I forgot. How stupid of me.

202
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,426
晚安，亲爱的。-晚安，约翰。
- Good night, honey. - Good night, John.

203
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:56,098
——那是什么?-我不知道。
- What's that? - I don't know.

204
00:16:56,182 --> 00:17:00,520
闭上眼睛，睡觉。这两个你。
Close your eyes, go to sleep. Both of you.

205
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:10,196
玛丽!
Marie!

206
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:20,373
宝贝，我20分钟后回来。
Hey, baby I'll be back in 20 minutes.

207
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,793
-我们到时候再谈，好吗?——确定。无论什么。
- We can talk then, okay? - Sure. Whatever.

208
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,296
- 20分钟。——正确的。
- Twenty minutes. - Right.

209
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,216
他是个大男孩。他会照顾好自己的。
He's a big boy. He'll take care of himself.

210
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,235
你没关前门。
You left your front door open.

211
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:53,406
有些人失业一年了，就为了找个工作。
There's guys out there been out of work a year, just lookin' for an open front door.

212
00:17:53,489 --> 00:18:00,288
他们进来，打开你的喉咙，偷走你的天顶……- 20秒后。-你来告诉我前门开着吗?
They come in, open up your throat, and steal your zenith... - In 20 seconds. - You came in here to tell me that my front door is open?

213
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:03,416
不。这是你的妈妈。
No. It's your mom.

214
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:06,002
别担心，她会没事的。
Don't worry, she's gonna be okay.

215
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:09,839
她在医院里
She's in the hospital.

216
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,133
这就是猫王现在的样子吗，艾琳阿姨?
Is that how Elvis looks now, aunt Irene?

217
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:15,636
——嗯。-不喜欢他穿的白色西装。
- Mm-hmm. - Don't like that white suit he's wearing.

218
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,680
既不做。
Neither do.

219
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:22,393
他穿得好像在日记女王之类的地方工作。
He dresses like he works at the diary queen or something.

220
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,899
看。上面说埃尔维斯周六会来克利夫兰。
Look. It says Elvis is coming to Cleveland on Saturday.

221
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:32,695
-约翰，我们能去看看他吗?-我不这么认为。
- John, can we go see him? - Don't think so.

222
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,032
-妈妈会喜欢的。-我知道她会喜欢的。
- Mom would love it. - I know she'd love it.

223
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,327
但我觉得她还会在这里。
But I thinks she's still gonna be here.

224
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,871
别担心。
Don't worry about a thing.

225
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,166
我来照顾孩子们，你照顾好你自己。
I'll take care of the kids, and you take care of yourself.

226
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,002
好吧。谢谢。
Okay. Thanks.

227
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,342
帕米，去跟你妈妈打个招呼。
Pammie, go say hi to your mommy.

228
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,971
-发生了什么事?-史蒂夫喝酒了。
- What happened? - Steve was drinking.

229
00:18:59,055 --> 00:19:02,266
结果他出了车祸。
And he got into an accident.

230
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,061
-她会没事吧?-是的，她会没事的。
- Is she gonna be all right? - Yeah, she'll be all right.

231
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:08,648
她有轻微脑震荡和几根肋骨擦伤。
She has a slight concussion and a couple bruised ribs.

232
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,108
她的眼睛怎么了?
What happened to her eye?

233
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:13,903
我猜她和史蒂夫吵架了。
Hmm, I guess she and Steve had a fight.

234
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,198
他打她吗?
He hit her?

235
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:20,743
-他在医院吗?-不，他们放了他
- Is he here in the hospital? - No, they released him.

236
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,912
狗娘养的!
Son of a bitch!

237
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:26,207
强尼，别这样，放松。好吧?
Johnny, come on, relax. Okay?

238
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,250
别让你妈妈不高兴。
Don't upset your mom.

239
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:32,046
她会没事的。
She's gonna be all right.

240
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,385
我很抱歉。你是对的。
I'm sorry. You're right.

241
00:19:37,468 --> 00:19:40,054
-我去跟她谈谈-是的。
- I'm gonna go talk to her. - Yeah.

242
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:43,057
我很快就回家。
I'll be home soon.

243
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,021
嘿,紧急刹车。
Hey, scram.

244
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:55,027
嘿,妈妈。——嗨,约翰尼。
- Hey, mom. - Hi, Johnny.

245
00:19:55,111 --> 00:19:58,155
漫长的20分钟，是吧?
Long 20 minutes, huh?

246
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,199
是的。
Yeah.

247
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:04,954
嘿,妈?
Hey, ma?

248
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,457
你觉得我们还能和好吗?
You think we'll ever be okay again?

249
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,960
我是说，像平常一样。
I mean, like normal.

250
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,003
是的。
Yeah.

251
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,048
确定。
Sure.

252
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:25,433
每天当我醒来…我希望情况会好转。
Every day when I wake up... I hope things'll get better.

253
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:29,145
他们从不做。
They never do.

254
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:37,445
也许你可以告诉我，妈妈。我能帮你什么忙吗?
Maybe if you could just tell me, mom. What can I do to help you?

255
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:44,285
我要怎么做才能让你再开心起来?
What can I do that's gonna make you happy again?

256
00:20:47,872 --> 00:20:49,832
我不知道。
I don't know.

257
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,477
听着，你待在这里。好吧?不要动。
Listen, you stay right here. Okay? Don't move.

258
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:17,026
嗨,约翰。

259
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,819

How ya doin'?

260
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,534
离我妈远点。
You stay away from my mother.

261
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:35,669
你在看什么?你在看什么?
What are you looking at? What were you watching?

262
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:41,884
像对待傻瓜一样对待我。
Treat me like a fool.

263
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:45,971
对我刻薄残忍。
Treat me mean and cruel.

264
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,642
但是爱我。
But love me.

265
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:55,356
绞紧我忠实的心。
Wring my faithful heart.

266
00:21:55,397 --> 00:22:03,364
撕裂一切，但爱我。-你不爱我吗?
Tear it all apart - but love me. - Won't you love me.

267
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:07,910
伙计们，我需要你们的帮助。
Guys, I need your help.

268
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,912
是吗?怎么了,伙计?
Yeah? What's up, man?

269
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,456
我们要让我妈和猫王约会。
We're gonna give my mom a date with Elvis Presley.

270
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,919
你打算怎么办?绑架他?
What are you gonna do? Kidnap him?

271
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:23,676
-不惜一切代价-拜托，伙计。
- Whatever it takes. - Come on, man.

272
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,513
我们要飞去孟菲斯还是好莱坞还是他住的什么鬼地方?
We gonna fly to Memphis or Hollywood or wherever the hell he lives?

273
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,432
不，他下周六在克利夫兰打球。
No, he's playing in Cleveland next Saturday.

274
00:22:30,516 --> 00:22:35,104
这家伙有900个保镖。
The guy's got like 900 bodyguards.

275
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:38,190
-我们会带着枪进去，对吧?——机枪。
- We're gonna go in with guns, right? - Machine guns.

276
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,819
没有机枪，就没有暴力。会很安全的。
No machine guns, no violence. It's gonna be real safe.

277
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:46,740
如果我们因为绑架而被捕…-我们应该因为绑架被捕…-米克·贾格尔!
If we're gonna get arrested for kidnapping somebody... - We should get arrested for kidnapping... - Mick Jagger!

278
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:49,285
-米克·贾格尔!-我们不会被逮捕的
- Mick Jagger! - We're not gonna get arrested.

279
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,496
而且，我只要离他近一点就能跟他说话。
Besides, I just gotta get close enough to talk to him.

280
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,124
也许我们能说服他和我们一起回来
Maybe we could convince him to come back with us.

281
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,626
他和我们一样是个普通人。
He's a regular guy like us.

282
00:22:57,710 --> 00:23:02,590
像我们这样的普通人没有5000万美元…他有私人飞机，每晚睡不同的女孩。
A regular guy like us doesn't have $50 million... His own private jet, and a different girl in bed every night.

283
00:23:02,673 --> 00:23:07,428
我要告诉你们多少次我是认真的?
How many times do I got to tell you guys that I'm serious?

284
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:16,979
你们知道我妈妈的事。她的……她有大麻烦了，伙计。
You guys know about my mom. She's... She's in a lot of trouble, man.

285
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:20,774
她爱猫王胜过一切。
And she loves Elvis Presley more than anything.

286
00:23:20,858 --> 00:23:28,782
我想，如果我能让她开心…也许我能让我们的家庭团结起来。
And I figure, you know, if I can make her happy... Then maybe I can hold our family together.

287
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:43,756
哈!看看这个。猫王香水。
Ha! Check this out. Elvis perfume.

288
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,927
-猫王狗牌。猫王口红。——猫王按钮。
- Elvis dog tags. Elvis lipstick. - Elvis buttons.

289
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:50,596
有什么东西是这家伙没装出来的吗?
Is there anything this guy didn't put his face on?

290
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,725
-我知道了。我知道怎么接近埃尔维斯了。——如何?
- I've got it. I know how we can get close to Elvis. - How?

291
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,186
-我们给他送了披萨。——一个披萨吗?
- We send him a pizza. - A pizza?

292
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:01,398
打扮成送披萨的，走过去敲他的门。
Dress up like a pizza delivery guy, walk up and knock on his door.

293
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,651
-你来了。它是美丽的。——正确的。
- And there you are. It's beautiful. - Right.

294
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:07,905
那当他说…"我没点披萨，儿子" ?
Then what do I do when he says... “I didn't order a pizza, son”?

295
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,824
这是你跟他谈谈的机会，说服他跟你回家。
That's your chance to talk to him, convince him to come home with ya.

296
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,953
这是没有好。周围会有很多人。
It's no good. There's gonna be too many people around.

297
00:24:14,036 --> 00:24:18,082
我得让他远离所有人。我们得让他一个人待着。
I've gotta get him away from everyone. We have to have him alone.

298
00:24:22,044 --> 00:24:24,046
罗西。
Rosie.

299
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:26,674
——罗西?——罗西?-披萨女?
- Rosie? - Rosie? - The pizza lady?

300
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:32,012
看看这个，伙计。罗西长得很像格拉迪斯·普雷斯利。
Check this out, man. Rosie looks a lot like Gladys Presley.

301
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,683
——猫王的母亲。——哇!
- Elvis's mother. - Wow!

302
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:39,853
-他们长得一点都不像。-你只是在看表面的东西。点击这里查看详情！
- They don't look anything alike. - You're just lookin" at the surface stuff. Check it out!

303
00:24:39,937 --> 00:24:42,690
他们有一样的眼睛，一样的脸。
They've got the same eyes, same face.

304
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:44,817
她要怎么帮我们抓到埃尔维斯?
How's she supposed to help us get Elvis?

305
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,862
埃尔维斯非常喜欢他的母亲。他爱她胜过一切。
Elvis was crazy about his mother. He loved her more than anything.

306
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,699
但这里说她已经死了十多年了。
But it says here she's been dead over ten years.

307
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,243
没关系。
It doesn't matter.

308
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,662
埃尔维斯是个很有激情的人。
Elvis is like an intense kind of guy.

309
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:01,458
他相信占星术和中东超自然的鬼话。
He believes in all that astrological and middle eastern supernatural bullshit.

310
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,211
我明白了。我们要扰乱他的头脑。
I get it. We're gonna mess with his head.

311
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:11,218
——恭喜你,罗西。——为什么?
- Congratulations, Rosie. - What for?

312
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:13,429
我们学校举行了这次比赛，你是获胜者。
My school had this contest, and you are the winner.

313
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:15,931
你在开玩笑吧!我赢了什么?
You're kidding! What did I win?

314
00:25:16,015 --> 00:25:24,023
你赢得了一张免费的前排票…今晚在美丽的克利夫兰市中心观看猫王的演唱会。
You won a free ticket, front row... To see Elvis Presley in concert tonight in beautiful downtown Cleveland.

315
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:26,859
——哦。——怎么了?
- Oh. - What's wrong?

316
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,695
你认为我可以把它换成汤姆·琼斯吗?
Do you think I could exchange it for Tom Jones?

317
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:37,703
我,我很抱歉。嗯…也许我会让我妹妹安妮去。
I, I'm sorry. Uh... Uh, maybe I'll let my sister Anne go instead.

318
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,997
她比我更喜欢猫王。
She likes Elvis better than I do.

319
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,421
不。你看，你不能……因为奖品的一部分就是你能亲眼见到猫王。
No. You see, you can't... Because part of the prize is that you get to meet Elvis Presley in person.

320
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:58,098
啊!那是整洁!我从没见过一个真正的名人是…哦!但是…嘿，有什么内幕?
Ah! That's neat! I never met a real celebrity be... Oh! But... Hey, what's the catch?

321
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,143
——抓?-是的。
- Catch? - Yeah.

322
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:06,148
当你赢得这些东西的时候总会有陷阱。
There's always a catch when you win these things.

323
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:09,777
托尼，你是从你老爸的药店买到乙醚的吗?以防。
Tony, did you get the ether from your old man's pharmacy? Just in case.

324
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:11,820
是啊，那家店关门后我偷偷溜进去的。
Yeah, I snuck in after the place closed.

325
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:15,157
布莱恩，你买到音乐会的票了吗?-是的，前排。
- Brian, did you get the concert tickets? - Yeah, front row.

326
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,493
我整晚都在排队，伙计。
I had to wait in line all night, man.

327
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,955
待在这里。我马上回来。
Stay here. I'll be right back.

328
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:44,019
格拉迪斯·普雷斯利死而复生了。
Gladys Presley has risen from the grave.

329
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:51,819
和你共度一夜。
One night with you.

330
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:58,867
这就是我现在祈祷的。
Is what I'm now prayin' for.

331
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,495
-托尼，帮我个忙，停车。-是的,当然。
- Tony, do me a favor, park the car. - Yeah, sure.

332
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,957
-就这样吗，约翰尼?我们在这里吗?-就是它了。我们在这里。
- Is this it, Johnny? We're here? - This is it. We're here.

333
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,876
我现在可以见到他了?
I get to meet him now, huh?

334
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,087
是的,很快。
Yeah, real soon.

335
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,674
我真希望我不用戴这假发。我喜欢金色的头发。
I wish I didn't have to wear this wig. I like my hair blonde.

336
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:16,510
我告诉过你。猫王喜欢深色头发的女人。
I told you before. Elvis loves women with dark hair.

337
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,554
还有这条裙子，太可怕了。
And this dress, it is horrible.

338
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:22,141
——它是蓝色的。猫王的最喜欢的颜色。——真的吗?
- It's blue. Elvis's favorite color. - Really?

339
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:24,685
是的。你没听过“蓝色麂皮鞋”这首歌吗?
Yeah. Haven't you ever heard of the song “blue suede shoes”?

340
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,312
是的。
Yeah.

341
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:29,773
对不起。我们能从这里通过吗?谢谢。
Sorry. Could we get through here? Thanks.

343
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:34,319
你没事吧?
You okay?

344

他在那儿!
There he is!

345
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,659

00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:45,891
-我要出去。——为什么?

347
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,893
我想要一个芝士汉堡。
I want a cheeseburger.

348
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:51,438
-我去叫客房服务。-我不想要客房送餐汉堡。
- I'll call room service. - I don't want a room service burger.

349
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:57,319
我想要那种油腻的，就像你在咖啡店买到的那种……桌子上放着点唱机。
I want one of them greasy kinds, like you get in a coffee shop... With the little jukeboxes on the tables.

350
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,321
整个城市都知道你在这里。
The whole city knows you're here.

351
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:04,326
广播，电视，报纸上都有。你一出去，人们就会把你撕碎。
It's on the radio, TV, in the papers. You go out, people'll tear you up.

352
00:29:04,368 --> 00:29:07,579
我要一个芝士汉堡!

I want to sit down in the coffee shop and eat it myself.

We can do like we always do. We'll go there after hours.

你可以独享整个咖啡店，包括油脂和所有东西。
You can have the whole coffee shop to yourself, grease and all.

357
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:30,686
我受够了这个地方只有我一个人!
I'm sick of havin' the place all to myself!

358
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,689

我希望你做得很好。戴安娜人证都能用。”
I hope you do great. Diana cantinflas.”

366

- Cruel world out there, isn't it? - You said it, “e."

“就像我一直告诉你的那样。
“Just like I always told you I would.

372

“爱和吻来自你的宝贝……Satnin。3
“Love and kisses from your precious... Satnin. III

373
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,434
Satnin”?那是谁?一些拉斯维加斯脱衣舞吗?
Satnin'? Who's that? Some Vegas stripper?

374

来吧,男人。他什么都不知道。

You haven't been around long enough to know.

378
00:31:11,745 --> 00:31:16,124
-知道吗，“e”?——Satnin”。他以前就是这么叫他妈妈的。
- Know what, “e”? - Satnin'. That's what he used to call his mama.

379
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:18,835
这有点像他对她的爱称。
It was kinda like his pet name for her.

380
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,819
女士们先生们，猫王时间到了。
Ladies and gentlemen, it's Elvis time.

381
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,571
猫王!猫王!猫王!
Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!

382
00:31:46,655 --> 00:31:51,993
猫王!猫王!猫王!猫王!猫王!猫王!
Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!

383
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,754
看这里,乔治。爱丽丝库珀。
Look here, George. Alice Cooper.

384
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:05,340
嗯。
Hmph.

385
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:08,301
也许我应该留长发，对吧?
Maybe I oughta grow my hair long, huh?

386
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:12,305
别再穿这些时髦的白色西装玩拉斯维加斯了。再一次震撼他们。
Stop wearin' these funky white suits and playin' Vegas. Really rock 'em again.

387
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:15,892
当然，如果你想失去你的观众。
Sure, man, if you want to lose your audience.

388
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,979
我的观众有死亡的危险。
My audience is in danger of dyin'.

389
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:22,149
-我想再为孩子们演奏一次。-你还有年轻粉丝。
- I wanna play for the kids again. - You still got young fans.

390
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:24,985
-他们坐在哪里?后排的?——地狱,“e”。
- Where do they sit? In the back row? - Hell, “e."

391
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:27,362
你不能冒这样的险。
You can't afford to take a chance like that.

392
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:32,492
当我破产的时候，我可以做任何我想做的事。
When I was broke, I could afford to do anything I wanted.

393
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:37,539
现在我是百万富翁了，什么事都干不起。
Now I'm a millionaire, can't afford to do a damn thing.

394
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,418
猫王!猫王!猫王!猫王!
Elvis! Elvis! Elvis! Elvis!

395
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,395
乔。

396
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,365
显示时间。
Show time.

397
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:21,374
唷。唷。
Whew. Whew.

398
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,633
哦,我的上帝!
Oh, my god!

399
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:27,440

你想怎么做都行。

401
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,991
好了，现在没事了，妈妈我没事了。
Well, that's all right now, mama that's all right with me.

402
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,994
没关系，我妈妈不管你怎么做。

That's all right, my mama any way you want to do,

405
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:56,970
没关系，我妈妈你想怎么做都行
that's all right, my mama any way that you wanna do that's all right

406
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,704
猫王!
Elvis!

407
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:26,666
智者说。
Wise men say.

408
00:35:28,752 --> 00:35:32,839
只有傻瓜才会冲进去。
Only fools rush in.

409
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:39,304
但我帮不了你。
But I can't help.

410
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:44,476
爱上你。
Falling in love with you.

411
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:52,400
我要留下来。
Shall I stay.

412
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:59,574
这是一种罪过吗?
Would it be a sin.

413
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:02,702
因为我无能为力。
For I can't help.

414
00:36:02,744 --> 00:36:06,081
坠入爱河。
Falling in love.

415
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:10,293
-罗西，起来。我们走吧。-和你一起-把花给他——花吗?
- Rosie, get up. Let's go. - With you, - give him the flowers. - The flowers?

416
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:16,675
像河流一样，一定会流向大海。
Like a river flows, surely to the sea.

417
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,135
亲爱的，就是这样。
Darling, so it goes.

418
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:24,891
有些事是命中注定的。
Some things are meant to be.

419
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:38,822
牵着我的手，也带走我的一生。
Take my hand, take my whole life too.

420
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,824
你看到猫王拿走花了吗?
Did you see Elvis take the flowers?

421
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:47,580
因为我情不自禁地坠入爱河。
For I can't help falling in love.

422
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:51,626
-和你一起-耶
- With you, - yeah!

423
00:36:51,710 --> 00:37:09,436
因为我情不自禁地爱上了你
For I can't help falling in love with you

424
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:58,151
女士们,先生们…埃尔维斯已经离开了大楼。
Ladies and gentlemen... Elvis has left the building.

425
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,695
谢谢你！
Thank you.

426
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:04,115
我们走吧。起来,起来,起来。
Let's go. Up, up, up.

427
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,579
是的,男人,是的。听起来就像摇滚乐。
Yeah, man, yeah. Sounds just like rock and roll to me.

428
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,831
好节目。

429
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,841
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my god.

430
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,013
怎么了,男人吗?
What's wrong, man?

431
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:30,058
一文不值。什么事都没有。
Nothin'. Nothin' at all's wrong.

432
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:41,027
然后我的灵魂歌唱。
Then sings my soul.

433
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:45,573
我的救主上帝。
My savior god to thee.

434
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:50,286
你是多么伟大。
How great thou art.

435
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:57,252
你是多么伟大。
How great thou art.

436
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:58,563
-天啊，他不会出现的。——我们只想放松一下。
- Oh, man, he's never gonna show. - Just relax.

437
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,817
耶稣。
Jesus.

438
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,451
-他在那儿!-你确定吗?
- There he is! - Are you sure?

439
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,494
-绝对是他。——下来!
- That's definitely him. - Get down!

440
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:15,538
住下来!嘘。
Stay down! Shh.

441
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:18,249
-开车过去就行。——我要。保持冷静，好吗?
- Just drive up. - I'm gonna. Just stay calm, all right?

442
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:33,014
你是谁?
Who are you?

443
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:43,024
很高兴见到你，普雷斯利先生。
I'm happy to meet you, Mr. Presley.

444
00:40:43,066 --> 00:40:45,318

447
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:59,433
什么都没有。我和我的朋友想知道你是否愿意来我家住几天。
Nothing. Me and my friends were wondering if you'd like to come to my house for a couple days.

448
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,519
-没人会伤害你的-把别人打扮成我妈的样子怎么样?
- No one's gonna hurt ya. - What's the idea dressin' somebody up like my mother?

449
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,880
-你是神经病吗?-不，我没有。
- You some kinda sicko or what? - No, I'm not.

450
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:09,008
-我想这是我能接近你的唯一方法。——你生病。
- I figured this was the only way I could get close to you. - You're sick.

451
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:12,090
-拜托，听我说一秒钟我的问题。-别挡我的路，孩子。
- Please, just listen to my problem for one second. - Get out of my way, son.

452
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,431

454
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:23,815
-世界卫生大会…-你在干什么?

455
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,858
-好吧，嗯…-你在干什么?

- Carry him in the car. Rosie, get in. - No!

457
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:33,741
上帝!你在干什么?你做了什么?
God! What are you doing? What have you done?

458

——哦,天哪!-没人会受伤的请,罗西。
- Oh, no! - No one's gonna get hurt. Please, Rosie.

——对不起!你没说过。-我知道我没这么说
- I'm sorry! You didn't say this. - I know I didn't say this.

460
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:42,101
这真的不是计划的一部分。
This is really not part of the package or anything.

461
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,085
-别伤害他。-别担心，罗西。
- Don't hurt him. - Don't worry, Rosie.

- The police are gonna get us. - No police are gonna get involved. Don't worry.

463
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,758
一个很老的朋友。
A very old friend.

464
00:41:50,800 --> 00:42:00,977
今天来过，因为他告诉镇上所有人…他刚刚找到的爱，原因是。

You don't turn us in to the cops... And your sister Anne could be... The only girl in town who gets to meet Elvis Presley.

471

妈妈。

472
00:42:41,434 --> 00:42:44,479
她会很高兴的。
She'd really like that.

00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:48,066
好吧。好吧，我会把嘴闭上的。
Okay. Okay, I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.

474
00:42:48,149 --> 00:42:50,610
我今晚带她去酒店。

475
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:53,446
好吧?

00:42:58,493 --> 00:43:00,411
-来吧，来吧-没事的。
- Come on, come on. - It's all right.

477
00:43:00,495 --> 00:43:02,538
重量减轻了。加油！加油
The weight is off. Come on, come on.

478
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,167
-我们在推吗?-不，他又滑倒了。
- Are we pushing? - No, he's slipping again.

——把它!——好拍摄!

把他带到我家来。来吧。

484
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,142
好吧,推。他就像一头死骡子。
All right, push. He's like a dead mule.

485
00:43:23,184 --> 00:43:25,436
我试着”。他是slippin”!
I'm tryin'. He's slippin'!

486
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,940
保罗，你要用力。约翰,约翰!来吧。在里面。在里面。
Paul, you gotta push. John, John! Come on. Inside. Inside.

487
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,460
约翰尼!约翰尼,醒来。
Johnny! Johnny, wake up.

488
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:54,090
Pammie。
Pammie.

489
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,886
-是爸爸吗?——不。
- Is that dad? - Nah.

490
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,889
这是猫王。
It's Elvis Presley.

491
00:44:01,931 --> 00:44:04,892
不可能。
No way.

492
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:09,397
嗯。
Mmm.

493
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,697
哇!
Wow!

494
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,740
你要拿他怎么办?
What're you gonna do with him?

495
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,412
我要把他交给妈妈。
I'm gonna give him to mom.

496
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:27,456
有点像“欢迎回家”的礼物。
Kinda like a “welcome home” gift.

497
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,544
我打赌比起我送她的耳环，她更喜欢他。
Bet she likes him more than the earrings I got her.

498
00:44:31,586 --> 00:44:33,838
Pammie !

-该去教堂了。——未来。

别跟艾琳阿姨说这件事，好吗?

501
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:43,097
- Zip。- Zip。

502
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,771
嗯?
Huh?

你。

504
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:05,244
别挡道，孩子。

00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:11,584
-我不想用这个-看这里。
- I don't want to have to use this. - Now, look here.

506
00:45:11,626 --> 00:45:14,921
你现在放我出去，我就不会起诉你。
You let me out of here now, and I won't press charges.

507
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,924
-对不起，我不能。-你想要钱?
- I'm sorry, I can't. - You want money?

508
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,676
大概有5000个。这是你的。保留它。
I got about 5,000 there. It's yours. Keep it.

509
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:25,223
我不要你的钱。我只是需要你。
I don't want your money. I just need you.

510
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:28,643
我吗?为了什么?
Me? For what?

511
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,645
我的母亲。
My mother.

512
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:33,856
不要提到母亲。你让我更生气了。
Don't you mention mothers. You get me more pissed off.

513
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:42,406
-你耍了一个卑鄙的把戏，扰乱我的思想。——我很抱歉。它只是…我想既然你这么爱你妈妈，你应该能理解我的问题。
- That was a dirty trick you played, messin' with my mind. - I'm sorry. It's just... I figured that since you loved your mother so much, you could understand my problem.

514
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:46,869
-不要把时间花在别人的问题上。-我只是想让你和她谈谈。
- Don't have time for other people's problems. - I just want you to talk to her.

515
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:50,539
-带她去吃饭-我看起来像什么?数据输入器的服务吗?
- Take her to dinner. - What do I look like? A datin' service?

516
00:45:50,623 --> 00:45:55,544
-你在和猫王说话。-我知道我在跟谁说话
- You're talking to Elvis Presley. - I know exactly who I'm talkin' to.

517
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:57,797
你是唯一能帮她的人。
You're the only person who can help her.

518
00:45:57,838 --> 00:46:01,467
我还有五千万粉丝也这么说。
I got 50 million other fans that say the same thing.

519
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:05,054
git -现在!——是吗?你要对那些粉丝负责。
- Now git! - Yeah? Well, you've got a responsibility to those fans.

520
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,640
我有责任做唱片。
I've got a responsibility to make records.

521
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:10,101
如果你妈妈需要帮助，告诉她去买我的新专辑。
If your mother needs help, tell her to go buy my new album.

522
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:13,813
现在，扣动扳机。
Now, pull the trigger.

523
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:16,816
来吧，杀了我。来吧。猫王开枪。
Come on, shoot me. Come on. Shoot Elvis Presley.

524
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,486
来吧。我不会开枪的。
Come on. I'm not gonna shoot ya.

525
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,864
我不这么认为。
I didn't think so.

526
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:27,243
让我离开这里。
Let me get out of here.

527
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:34,750
所以有人带着问题来找你，你却不理他，对吧?
So someone comes to you with a problem and you turn your back on them, right?

528
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,211
就像你对待摇滚乐一样。
Just like you did with rock 'n' roll.

529
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:42,300
-我从来没有放弃过摇滚。——哦,不是吗?
- I never turned my back on rock 'n' roll. - Oh, no?

530
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:44,760
你没必要坐着看15次拉斯维加斯的盛世。
You didn't have to sit through viva Las Vegas 15 times.

531
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,847
我从没说过我的电影和摇滚有关。
I never said my movies had anything to do with rock 'n' roll.

532
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,890
你的演唱会怎么样?
How 'bout your concerts?

533
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:52,727
-我的演唱会太棒了-是吗如果你65岁。
- My concerts kick ass. - Yeah? If you're 65 years old.

534
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:57,773
-还有年轻粉丝。——在哪里?我没看到。我17岁。
- Still got young fans. - Where? I don't see any. I'm 17.

535
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:01,569
我这个年纪的人都不会买你的唱片。我这个年纪的人不会去听你的演唱会。
Nobody my age buys your records. Nobody my age goes to your concerts.

536
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:07,408
谁他妈想看一个人在舞台上腾跃……穿着白色连体衣唱着"共和国战歌" ?
Who the hell wants to see some guy prance around on stage... In a white jumpsuit singing “the battle hymn of the republic”?

537
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:09,869
开枪。我们可以去看爱丽丝·库珀唱《十八岁》
Shoot. We can go see Alice Cooper sing “eighteen.”

538
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,371
-哦，爱丽丝·库珀!-是的。
- Oh, Alice Cooper! - Yeah.

539
00:47:12,413 --> 00:47:16,625
是啊，一个叫女孩名字的男人…在台上穿女人的内裤。
Yeah, a guy with a girl's name... Wears women's underwear onstage.

540
00:47:16,709 --> 00:47:20,087
我听说他会把蛇的头咬下来。你喜欢那样，不是吗?
I hear he bites the heads off snakes. You'd like that, wouldn't you?

541
00:47:20,171 --> 00:47:23,382
我没说他有多好，伙计。
I'm not saying he's any better, man.

542
00:47:23,424 --> 00:47:26,761
我只是说他很酷。你曾经的样子。
I'm just saying he's cool. Something you used to be.

543
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,681
我可不是过去的样子，孩子。
I ain't no used-to-be, boy.

544
00:47:31,766 --> 00:47:33,893
你在路上了，伙计。
You're on your way, man.

545
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,021
为什么?因为我给了人们他们想要的?
Why? 'Cause I give the people what they want?

546
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,981
完全正确。
Exactly.

547
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:42,443
-你在拍你曾经踢过的那个屁股。——基森的屁股吗?
- You're kissin' that same ass you used to kick. - Kissin' ass?

548
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:46,322
你以前是那种给别人不想要的东西的人。
You used to be the kind of guy who gave the people what they didn't want.

549
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:52,995
你今天为之效力的人…我在1956年被你吓死了。
The same people you play for today... Were scared to death of you in 1956.

550
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:56,749
你是个反叛者，伙计。牛逼。
You were a rebel, man. A bad-ass.

551
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,295
你是猫王。
You were Elvis.

552
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,179
你知道什么?
What do you know?

553
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:15,184
比上校要多得多。比和你一起玩的那些肥杂种多。地狱,是的。
A lot more than the colonel. More than those fat bastards you hang out with. Hell, yeah.

554
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:19,647
你上次跟我这样的人说话是什么时候?
When was the last time you even talked to somebody like me, huh?

555
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,942
俄亥俄中部某个无名小卒吗?
Some little fucking nobody in the middle of Ohio?

556
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:29,615
见鬼，伙计，你离开你的根太久了…你都不知道他们到底是什么。
Hell, man, you've been away from your roots so long... You don't even know what the hell they are.

557
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:43,129
你,嗯…你真的认为我失去了我的根吗?
You, uh... You really think I'm losing touch with my roots?

558
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,681
我是说，就一个晚上。
I'm saying, one night.

559
00:48:53,722 --> 00:48:56,976
只一个晚上。那只是因为我不想感到内疚。
One night only. That's just 'cause I don't wanna feel guilty.

560
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,978
是的,上校。
Yeah, colonel.

561
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:04,150
是的。听着，我很抱歉就这么走了。
Yeah. Listen, I'm sorry I run off like that.

562
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:08,154
不,我……只是想理清思绪。
No, I... Just wanna clear my head.

563
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,740
开车转几天。我租了一辆车。
Drive around for a few days. I rented a car.

564
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,827
不，我不需要任何人陪伴。
No, I don't need any company.

565
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:18,205
没有，没有电话。你联系不上我。
No, there's no phone. You can't get in touch with me.

566
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:22,877
不,我知道。是的。周日在匹兹堡的音乐会。我就会与你同在。
No, I know. Yeah. The concert in Pittsburgh on Sunday. I'll be there.

567
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,171
好吧,再见。
All right, bye.

568
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:30,009
埃尔维斯，那是什么。代表什么?
Elvis, what's that “t.C.B.” thing stand for?

569
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,178
“处理公事。”
“Taking care of business.”

570
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:35,681
现在，我在哪里可以买到衣服?
Now, uh, where can I get some clothes?

571
00:49:35,723 --> 00:49:37,766
呃，上楼吧。
Uh, come on upstairs.

572
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,355
-这些是你爸爸的衣服，对吧?——是的。
- These are your dad's clothes, huh? - Yep.

573
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,734
我和他一定差不多大。
Me and him must be about the same size.

574
00:49:46,775 --> 00:49:49,904
-我以前在《56》里就是这么穿的——是的,男人。
- It's the way I used to dress back in "56." - Yeah, man.

575
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,616
我妈妈说你是56年最酷的。
My mama says you looked the coolest in '56.

576
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,368
-是吗?——是的,”56。
- She did, huh? - Yeah, '56.

577
00:49:56,452 --> 00:50:01,582
——嗯。-除了…-我不知道，伙计什么是错的。-你在说什么?
- Hmm. - Except... - I don't know, man. Something's wrong. - What are you talkin' about?

578
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:06,337
我不知道。看起来不太对劲。
I don't know. It just doesn't look right.

579
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:10,883
-我觉得挺好的。-看起来很好，但有点不对劲。
- Looks fine to me. - Looks fine, but something's just not right.

580
00:50:10,925 --> 00:50:13,886
你觉得这是什么?
What do you think it is?

581
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:16,055
——朋友。——哦,天哪!
- Buddy. - Oh, no!

582
00:50:16,138 --> 00:50:19,183
- - - - - -来吧。-小修剪，是吧?
- Come on. - Little trim, huh?

583
00:50:20,518 --> 00:50:23,270
也许可以把黑色染料洗掉?
Maybe wash the black dye out?

584
00:50:23,354 --> 00:50:30,069
-你染了头发?——嗯…你有什么资格谈论风格?这叫什么?
- You dye your hair? - Well... Who are you to talk about style? What do you call this?

585
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:32,112
夹克。
Jacket.

586
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:35,741
-那是美国国旗!-是的，但是看起来很酷。
- That's an American flag! - Yeah, but it looks cool.

587
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:38,869
汗渍在条纹上，草渍在星星上。
Sweat on the stripes, and grass stains on the stars.

588
00:50:38,953 --> 00:50:41,664
接下来是什么?国旗厕纸吗?
What's next, huh? Flag toilet paper?

589
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:44,875
——放松的人。这只是一件夹克。——这是可耻的。把它关掉。
- Relax, man. It's just a jacket. - It's disgraceful. Take it off.

590
00:50:44,959 --> 00:50:47,399
-我不会脱下来的看起来太好了。-脱下来!
- I ain't gonna take it off. It looks too good. - Take it off!

591
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,839
在这里。
Here.

592
00:50:50,923 --> 00:50:54,426
持有它。褶皱。
Hold it. Fold.

593
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:56,762
一次。
Again.

594
00:50:58,681 --> 00:51:03,018
这个国家的年轻人，都快完蛋了。
The youth of this country, goin' straight to the dogs.

595
00:51:07,523 --> 00:51:10,859
伙计，我为什么要用女士剃刀?
Man, how come I had to use a lady's razor?

596
00:51:10,943 --> 00:51:12,861
我失去了我的。
I lost mine.

597
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,781
是的,对的。
Yeah, right.

598
00:51:28,002 --> 00:51:32,840
-我妈妈回来了我在楼下等你。-当然，孩子。
- My mom's home. I'll meet you downstairs. - Yeah, sure, kid.

599
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:45,978
嗨。嗨,妈。欢迎回家。
Hi. Hi, ma. Welcome home.

600
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:50,399
你是想省电吗?这里太黑了!
Are you trying to save on electricity? It's dark in here!

601
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,068
我觉得会很浪漫。
I thought it might be romantic.

602
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:57,156
这地方一点都不浪漫。
There's nothing romantic about this place.

603
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,665
如果你去的话。
If you ever go.

604
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:13,922
亲爱的，我会很孤独
Darlin', I'll be oh so lonely

605
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:19,428
我会感到悲伤和忧郁。
I'll be sad and blue.

606
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:23,807
对你哭泣。
Cryin over you.

607
00:52:23,891 --> 00:52:33,025
亲爱的只会乞讨和偷窃。
Dear only would beg and steal.

608
00:52:35,736 --> 00:52:53,587
只为感受你温暖的心跳靠近我。
Just to feel your warm heart beat close to mine.

609
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:57,883
如果你去的话。
If you ever go.

610
00:52:57,966 --> 00:53:02,429
亲爱的，我会的。
Darlin', I'll be oh.

611
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:07,559
所以孤独。
So lonely.

612
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:11,480
跪下求我。
Beggin' on my knees.

613
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,400
我只要求你。
All I ask is please.

614
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:21,031
请爱我。
Please love me.

615
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,121
神圣的狗屎!
Holy shit!

616
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:33,585
你做……约翰尼?
What're you do... Johnny?

617
00:53:37,673 --> 00:53:39,967
妈，你在干什么?
Ma, what are you doing?

618
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,803
——这是他。他在这里!-我知道是他。
- It's him. He's here! - I know it's him.

619
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,847
-他在我们家!-你能冷静一下吗?
- He's in our house! - Would you calm down?

620
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:47,641
-但我还没准备好我还没准备好。——放松。
- But I'm not ready. I'm not ready at all. - Relax.

621
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:50,978
但是，但是，但是，他从哪里来?他是怎么来的?
But, but, but, where did he come from? How did he get here?

622
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,021
-我带他来的-你没有。
- I brought him here. - You did not.

623
00:53:53,105 --> 00:53:58,861
看看我的头发，简直是一团糟。天啊，没化妆。
Look at my hair, it's a wreck. Oh, god, no make-up.

624
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,613
一条裙子。我需要一条裙子。
A dress. I need a dress.

625
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:04,908
我已经两年多没买过裙子了。
I haven't bought a dress in over two years.

626
00:54:04,992 --> 00:54:09,121
-等一下。约翰尼，怎么样?-你的婚纱?
- Wait a minute. Johnny, how's this, huh? - Your wedding gown?

627
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,373
-太多了，是吧?——小。
- Too much, huh? - A little.

628
00:54:11,457 --> 00:54:14,209
我该怎么办?我该穿什么啊?
What am I gonna do? What am I gonna wear, huh?

629
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,796
-他是怎么来的?-我叫他来的。
- How did he get here anyway? - I asked him to come here.

630
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:19,840
他就这样来了?
And he came just like that?

631
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:23,385
-我不得不强迫他。-你强迫他?
- I kinda had to force him. - You forced him?

632
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:25,864
-我和伙计们，我们不得不强迫他…-违背他的意愿?
- Well, me and the guys, we had to force him to get... - Against his will?

633
00:54:25,888 --> 00:54:29,224
-是的。-你做那样的事会惹上麻烦的。
- Yeah. - You could get in trouble for doing something like that.

634
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:32,186
-你不该这么做!-我是为了你。
- You should not have done it! - I was doing it for you.

635
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:34,980
我不管你是为谁做的。这不是正确的。
I don't care who you did it for. It wasn't right.

636
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:39,526
-好吧，我下去告诉他可以走了…-哦,不。不,等等,等等。
- Fine, I'll go down and tell him he can leave... - Oh, no. No, wait, wait.

637
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:43,572
听着，既然他来了，我是说，他至少可以留下来吃晚饭。
Listen, now that he's here, I mean, he could at least stay for dinner.

638
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,199
正确的。
Right.

639
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:48,368
我不管你要怎么做。你下楼把他留在这里。
I don't care what you have to do. You go downstairs and keep him here.

640
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:51,705
好的，你说对了。
Right, you got it.

641
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:59,505
掷骰子。一，二，三，四，五。
Roll the dice. One, two, three, four, five.

642
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:02,925
-伙计，我打赌这是一艘梦幻之船。——无用!
- Man, I'll bet it's a dream boat. - Dud!

643
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,262
——走吧。-开始了。
- Go. - Here we go.

644
00:55:07,346 --> 00:55:09,264
-你是黑发的那个。-哦,是的。
- You're the brunette. - Oh, yeah.

645
00:55:09,348 --> 00:55:11,725
我当然是。
Of course I am.

646
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:18,732
很高兴见到你，普雷斯利先生。
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Presley.

647
00:55:18,816 --> 00:55:25,072
,嗯…欢迎你到我们家来。
And, uh... Welcome you to our home.

648
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:28,200
嗯,你可以…你可以叫我猫王。
Well, you can... You can call me Elvis.

649
00:55:28,242 --> 00:55:30,869
猫王。
Elvis.

650
00:55:30,953 --> 00:55:34,373
当然可以。猫王。哦,我的上帝。
Of course. Elvis. Oh, my god.

651
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:49,721
-我希望你不介意芝士汉堡。——嗯…-不，女士，它们很好。谢谢你！-哦,好的。
- I hope you don't mind cheeseburgers. - Well... - No, ma'am, they're just fine. Thank you. - Oh, good.

652
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:58,021
这些年来，我一直想着这一刻……还有终于见到你，请你来吃晚餐是什么感觉。
All these years I've been thinking about this moment... And what it'd be like to finally meet you and have you over for dinner.

653
00:55:58,105 --> 00:56:05,070
我有很多问题想问你…我现在一个也想不出来。
I had so many questions I wanted to ask you... And I can't think of a single one now.

654
00:56:05,112 --> 00:56:08,156
我记得你想知道一些关于猫王的事。
I remember something you wanted to know about Elvis.

655
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:09,908
什么?
What?

656
00:56:09,992 --> 00:56:14,454
-我听到你问艾琳阿姨的事-怎么了，亲爱的?
- Something I heard you asking aunt Irene about. - What was it, honey?

657
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:20,961
你想知道猫王的床技是否也一样好…因为他擅长唱歌。
You wondered if Elvis was as good in bed... As he was at singing.

658
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,963
我的上帝。
My god.

659
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:30,304
强尼，去开门。帕姆!
Johnny, get the door. Pam!

660
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:40,147
-强尼，他在哪?我的妹妹安妮。——嗨,罗西。这是怎么呢
- Johnny, where is he? My sister Anne. - Hi, Rosie. What's going on?

661
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:42,149
我告诉过你我会带她过来。
I told you I was bringing her by.

662
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:45,152
——我很抱歉。-愿上帝发发慈悲。
- I'm sorry. - The lord have mercy.

663
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:49,281
——看!他就在这里。安妮,他。-我想看看这个。
- Look! There he is. Anne, that's him. - I wanna take a look at this.

664
00:56:49,323 --> 00:56:51,992
罗西!
Rosie!

665
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:55,412
怎么了,伙计们?
What's up, guys?

666
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:58,165
-你好吗?看，这是谢丽尔。-嘿，嘿，嘿!
- How you doing? Look, this is Cheryl. - Hey, hey, hey!

667
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:01,168
和朱迪。这是麦斯特汉堡的。
And Judy. They're from meister burger.

668
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:05,547
-很高兴见到你。-他们会跟我们出去的，如果…-请给我们介绍一下猫王。-加油，伙计们!
- Pleased to meet you. - They'd go out with us if... - If you could introduce us to Elvis. - Come on, guys!

669
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:08,842
——谢谢你,小伙子。-你欠我们一个人情。猫王,老兄!
- Thanks, man. - You owe us one. Elvis, buddy!

670
00:57:10,302 --> 00:57:13,305
嘿,怎么了?
Hey, what's up?

671
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:17,309
-嗨，艾琳阿姨。——哦,天哪。这太大了!
- Hey, aunt Irene. - Oh, gosh. This is so big!

672
00:57:17,351 --> 00:57:20,646
上帝,他是美丽的。
God, he's beautiful.

673
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:24,066
艾琳。
Irene.

674
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:34,326
嘿,发生了什么?这是我叔叔的波尔卡乐队。
Hey, what's happening? This is my uncle's polka band.

675
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:37,913
我告诉他关于猫王的事。我想他们可能会被发现。
I told him about Elvis. I figured they might get discovered.

676
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,624
这更像是一个啤酒节。
It's more like an oktoberfest.

677
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:55,764
天呐
Holy shit.

678
00:57:59,101 --> 00:58:02,062
罗西,走了。
Go, Rosie, go.

679
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:13,991
自从你爸来过之后，我还没见过这么热闹。
I haven't seen it this lively since your dad was around.

680
00:58:14,074 --> 00:58:17,202
既然大家都来了，不如带他们去舞厅吧?
Since everybody's here, why don't you bring 'em in the ballroom?

681
00:58:17,244 --> 00:58:20,247
我去买些薯片，给你办一个真正的欢迎回家的派对。
I'll get some chips and throw you a real welcome-home party.

682
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:23,917
-好主意。快点回来。——好的。
- That's a great idea. Hurry back. - Okay.

683
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:30,382
是对的,那就去做。是的,是的。
Right, do it. Yeah, yeah.

684
00:58:30,424 --> 00:58:33,719
把它带回家，宝贝!
Take it home, baby!

685
00:58:44,021 --> 00:58:45,939
——嗨,普里西拉。——嘿,史蒂夫。
- Hi, Priscilla. - Hey, Steve.

686
00:58:46,023 --> 00:58:48,400
——什么?——朋友。
- What? - Buddy.

687
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:53,405
-你好,约翰。
-Hi, John.

688
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:59,578
来吧。
Come on.

689
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:03,248
我猜他今晚不想打架，是吗?
I guess he don't feel much like fightin' tonight, does he?

690
00:59:03,290 --> 00:59:05,834
-我想没有。——朋克。
- I guess not. - Punk.

691
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:08,962
晚安,约翰。
Good night, John.

692
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:11,798
我想打破这个，好吗?
I wanna break this one, all right?

693
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:29,042
-你不关灯睡觉吗?-不，她睡觉的时候戴着。
- Aren't you gonna turn your lights out and go to sleep? - No, she sleeps with them on.

694
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:32,778
哦!黏糊糊的灵魂吸吮者，是吧?
Oh! Slimy soul suckers, huh?

695
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,947
你知道他们吗?
You know about 'em?

696
00:59:36,031 --> 00:59:37,908
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

697
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:43,038
我的小女儿丽莎开着灯睡觉，我不知道要保护自己多久。
My little girl Lisa slept with her lights on for I don't know how long to protect herself.

698
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:45,791
所以你不认为我疯了?
So you don't think I'm crazy?

699
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:50,170
疯了吗?不。那些东西是杀手。
Crazy? No. Those things are killers.

700
00:59:50,212 --> 00:59:52,297
像你这样的小女孩得小心他们。
Little girl like you's gotta watch out for 'em.

701
00:59:52,339 --> 00:59:58,136
这就是我一直想告诉这里所有人的…但是没有人会听。
That's what I've been trying to tell everyone here... But no one will listen.

702
00:59:58,220 --> 01:00:01,264
嗯,我会的。
Well, I will.

703
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:16,822
你看，问题是……人们有点被误导了……关于那些黏糊糊的吸魂者。
You see, the thing is... People are a little misinformed... About the slimy soul suckers.

704
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:19,157
——误导?-是的。
- Misinformed? - Yeah.

705
01:00:19,241 --> 01:00:26,331
他们认为黏糊糊的吸血鬼只能杀死…当灯熄灭的时候。
They think that slimy soul suckers can only kill... When the lights are out.

706
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,542
但是，这并不是真的。
And, well, that just ain't true.

707
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:31,253
——不是吗?——没有。
- It isn't? - No.

708
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,840
当灯亮着的时候，黏糊糊的灵魂吸盘也能杀了你。
Slimy soul suckers can kill ya when the lights are on too.

709
01:00:34,881 --> 01:00:37,509
——他们可以吗?-是的。
- They can? - Yeah.

710
01:00:37,551 --> 01:00:39,553
我现在该怎么办?
What am I gonna do now?

711
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:44,182
现在，有办法打败他们了。
Well now, there's a way to beat 'em.

712
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:46,351
但你要坚强。
But you gotta be tough.

713
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:48,353
你严厉吗?
Are you tough?

714
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:54,609
也许吧。我该怎么做呢?
Maybe. Uh, what do I have to do?

715
01:00:57,404 --> 01:01:01,950
每天晚上睡觉前，你要关掉一盏灯。
Each night before you go to sleep, you turn out one light.

716
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:06,246
然后第二天晚上，你关了两盏灯。
And then the next night, you turn out two lights.

717
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,833
如此下去，直到所有的灯都熄灭。
And so on until all the lights are out.

718
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:13,044
那时候黏糊糊的吸血鬼就会知道了。
And that's when the slimy soul suckers will know.

719
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:15,714
知道吗?
Know what?

720
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:18,049
你不害怕。
That you're not afraid.

721
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,261
你看，他们不能忍受那些不害怕的小女孩。
You see, they can't stand little girls that aren't afraid.

722
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,431
-哦，它们会飞走的，再也不会回来了。——真的吗?
- Oh, they'll take off, they'll never come back. - Really?

723
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,559
为我的小女儿工作。她的灯一熄灭…
Worked for my little girl. Soon as her lights were off..

724
01:01:27,601 --> 01:01:30,812
那些黏糊糊的吸血鬼再也没回来。
The slimy soul suckers never came back.

725
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:34,232
——哇。-这样吧。
- Wow. - Tell you what.

726
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:36,568
让我们从这个开始。
Let's start with that one right over there.

727
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:39,863
-你说呢?-把它关掉?
- What do you say? - Uh, turn it out?

728
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,656
嗯哼。
Mm-hmm.

729
01:01:41,740 --> 01:01:45,410
我们就不能从这个开始吗?
Couldn't we start with that one?

730
01:01:45,452 --> 01:01:47,829
你到底想不想打败他们?
You wanna beat these guys or not?

731
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,975
好姑娘。
Good girl.

732
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,234
那就这样吧。
There you go.

733
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:20,779
一个下来。
One down.

734
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,822
晚上,亲爱的。
Night, sweetie.

735
01:03:26,219 --> 01:03:29,889
嗯…哦!
Um... oh!

736
01:03:29,973 --> 01:03:32,142
哦,我的上帝!约翰尼!
Oh, my god! Johnny!

737
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:35,603
你知道吗，他早就该回来了。
You know, he should've been back a long time ago.

738
01:03:35,687 --> 01:03:37,605
-他去哪了?-我不知道。
- Where'd he go? - I don't know.

739
01:03:37,689 --> 01:03:42,485
他说他要去派对商店，但那就在几英里外。
He said he was going to the party store, but that's a few miles away.

740
01:03:42,569 --> 01:03:45,280
你不担心。我去看看他，好吗?
Don't you worry. I'll go check on him, all right?

741
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:48,199
别担心。等待在这里。
Don't worry. Wait right here.

742
01:03:48,241 --> 01:03:51,786
埃尔维斯离开舞厅了。
Elvis has left the ballroom.

743
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,540
嘿，孩子，进城怎么走?
Hey, kid, which way to town?

744
01:03:55,582 --> 01:03:58,126
沿着这条路一直走。
Straight down the road.

745
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:01,713
我能用一下你的自行车吗?-当然，猫王。
- Can I use your bike? - Yeah, sure, Elvis.

746
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:19,022
打破它，燃烧它。
Break it, burn it.

747
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:22,442
到处拖着它。
Drag it all around.

748
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:30,742
扭它，扭它你不能把它弄下来，因为每一分钟每一小时。
Twist it, turn it you can't tear it down 'cause every minute every hour.

749
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:36,331
你会被这种奇怪而强大的力量所震撼……我的爱
You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power... Of my love

750
01:04:46,383 --> 01:04:48,635
嘿,猫王。
Hey, Elvis.

751
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,179
嘿，孩子，你怎么了?
Hey, kid, what happened to you?

752
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:53,431
-我跟人打架了-你没事吧?
- I got in a fight. - You all right?

753
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:57,102
-我很好。-看来你输了。
- Yeah, I'm fine. - Looks like you lost.

754
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:59,854
没有大便。
No shit.

755
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:03,316
-我想你没从我的电影中学到什么。——嗯?
- I guess you didn't learn anythin' from watchin' my movies. - Huh?

756
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,320
在我拍摄的几乎所有照片中，我都在打架，而且我总是赢。
In almost all my pictures I get in a fight, and I always win.

757
01:05:07,362 --> 01:05:11,324
这个问题有点棘手，伙计。
Well, this one was kind of tough, man.

758
01:05:11,366 --> 01:05:14,953
-是四个人对我。-有一次他们9个人联合起来对付我。
- It was four guys against me. - I had nine of 'em gang up on me once.

759
01:05:14,994 --> 01:05:18,164
-打遍了所有人-这不是电影，伙计
- Whupped every one of 'em. - This isn't the movies, man.

760
01:05:18,248 --> 01:05:22,127
如果出现这种情况，我会和他们中最厉害的人一起踢屁股。
If the situation arose, I'd kick ass with the best of 'em.

761
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:26,339
正确的。只要有人喊"行动"
Right. As long as somebody was yelling “action.”

762
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,676
我要走了。
I'm out of here.

763
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:35,306
-你得回家了你妈妈担心死了。——猫王?
- You need to get on home. Your mama's worried sick. - Elvis?

764
01:05:35,348 --> 01:05:36,850
是吗?
Yeah?

765
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:47,318
你很了解女人，是吧?
You know a lot about women, don't ya?

766
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:53,158
孩子，在我把她们变成女人之前，她们都只是女孩。
Well, son, they're all just girls until I turn 'em into women.

767
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:58,496
-是的。我想这就是为什么也许你能帮我。-当然，有什么问题吗?
- Yeah. Well, I figure that's why maybe you can help me. - Sure, what's the problem?

768
01:05:58,538 --> 01:06:02,167
这个女孩。她的名字叫贝斯。
There's this girl. Her name's Beth.

769
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:11,843
她住在那里，而且…我真想走到她面前，约她出去。
She lives up there, and... I want so badly just to go up to her and ask her on a date.

770
01:06:11,926 --> 01:06:16,222
但是…不要告诉任何人。
But... don't say anything to anybody.

771
01:06:19,601 --> 01:06:22,061
我不知道。我…我很害怕。
I don't know. I'm... I'm scared.

772
01:06:22,145 --> 01:06:24,272
你在怕什么?
What are you scared of?

773
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:31,362
她是个…我不知道。我配不上她。
Well, that she's a g... I don't know. That I'm not good enough for her.

774
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:37,202
大便。见鬼，伙计，你根本不知道这是什么感觉。
Shit. Hell, man, you don't know what the hell this feels like.

775
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,539
哦，是的，我喜欢。
Oh, yes, I do.

776
01:06:41,581 --> 01:06:44,459
你觉得我为什么花那么多时间在吉他上?
Why do you think I spent so much time with my guitar?

777
01:06:44,542 --> 01:06:47,670
-吉他不能拒绝。-是的。
- Guitar can't say no. - Yeah.

778
01:06:47,754 --> 01:06:50,423
但后来我发现了这个秘密。
But then I discovered the secret.

779
01:06:50,507 --> 01:06:54,636
比爱情药水好。我找到了你想要的任何女孩的钥匙。
Better than a love potion. I found the key to gettin' any girl you want.

780
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,222
那是什么?
What's that?

781
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:02,310
——信心。——信心?
- Confidence. - Confidence?

782
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:05,480
一旦我有了信心，我就有了女朋友。
Once I got confidence, I got girls.

783
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,482
你有女孩，因为你是猫王。"
You got girls "cause you're Elvis Presley."

784
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:10,568
不，孩子，女歌手比畅销唱片早。
No, son, the ladies came before the hit records.

785
01:07:10,610 --> 01:07:13,071
不,诚实的。女人喜欢的信心。
No, honest. Women love confidence.

786
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:18,493
你把自己打扮得漂漂亮亮……擦亮你的鞋子，买一大束花。
You slick yourself up... Shine your shoes, get a nice big bouquet of flowers.

787
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:26,251
只要有信心，就能爬上那座山，敲开那扇门……那会让那个小女孩疯狂地爱上你的。
And just the confidence it takes to march up that hill and knock on that door... That'll make that little girl fall crazy in love with you.

788
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:28,336
你这样认为吗?
You think so?

789
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:33,591
我知道。
I know so.

790
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,528
的信心。是的。
Confidence. Yeah.

791
01:08:02,453 --> 01:08:05,248
Oh-ho-ho。可能是火花塞的问题。
Oh-ho-ho. It's probably the spark plug.

792
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:09,961
-这是全新的——是吗?你知道的，他们有时会崩溃。
- It's a brand-new one. - Yeah? Well, they give out sometimes, you know.

793
01:08:10,003 --> 01:08:12,797
让我给她一次机会，好吗?
Let me give her a shot, huh?

794
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:28,605
-这需要温柔的抚摸，你知道的。-是的。
- It takes a gentle touch, you know. - Yeah.

795
01:08:28,688 --> 01:08:31,316
你介意吗?
You mind?

796
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:36,821
哦，宝宝，宝宝，宝宝，宝宝，宝宝，宝宝，宝宝，宝宝，宝宝，宝宝。
Oh, baby, baby baby, baby, baby, baby, baby booma, booma, booma.

现在，宝贝回来，宝贝娃娃。

回来吧，宝贝。

我在说什么。
What I'm talkin' about.

802
01:09:08,978 --> 01:09:15,943
回到我身边，小姑娘，我们可以过家家，现在，宝贝回来，宝贝娃娃。
Come on back to me, little girl, so we can play some house, now, baby come back, baby doll.

回来吧，宝贝，我想和你过家家，我想过家家。

805
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:24,702
来吧。
Come on.

806
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,913
-我们要去哪?-我们去购物
- Where we goin'? - We're goin' shoppin'

807
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:29,207
-我们要去购物?猫王!-是的。

808
01:09:33,086 --> 01:09:35,713
-他们没认出我来。——嗯。
- They didn't recognize me. - Uh-uh.

809
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:39,300
看这里。没人认识我!
Look here. Nobody's recognizing me!

810
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:41,928
我已经15年没能做到了。
I haven't been able to do this for 15 years.

811
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,805
我能为您效劳吗?
May I help you?

812
01:09:43,888 --> 01:09:47,767
-是的，我们要了。-哦，当然。哪一项?
- Yeah, we'll take it. - Oh, of course. Which item?

813
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:49,769
这一切。一切。
All of it. Everything.

814
01:09:49,811 --> 01:09:53,106
——啊。交货日期吗?——明天早上。
- Ah. Delivery date? - Tomorrow morning.

815
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:56,067
哦,我很抱歉。我们需要10天交货。
Oh, I'm sorry. We require ten days for delivery.

816
01:09:56,109 --> 01:09:59,946
-你知道你在跟谁说话吗?——没有。
- You know who you're talkin' to? - No.

817
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,074
我是猫王。
I'm Elvis Presley.

818
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:08,287
我是恩格尔伯特·汉珀丁克。
And I'm Engelbert Humperdinck.

819
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:10,707
我们走吧。
Let's go.

820
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,755
我们会去一家你想要什么就送什么的商店。
We'll go to a store where they deliver things when you want 'em.

821
01:10:17,839 --> 01:10:20,091
有钱能使鬼推磨
Money talks.

822
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:30,685
宝贝，有件事我想让你知道。
Well, this is one thing, baby that I want you to know.

823
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:37,358
来吧，让我们玩一个小房子，我们可以像以前一样好吧，宝贝回来，宝贝娃娃。
Come on back and let's play a little house and we can act like we did before well, baby come back, baby doll.

824
01:10:37,442 --> 01:10:39,819
回来吧，宝贝。

宝贝，宝贝，宝贝，宝贝，回来吧，宝贝，我想和你过家家
Ba by, baby, baby, ba by, baby, baby, come back, baby I wanna play house with you,

827
01:11:16,564 --> 01:11:19,150
你好,约翰。-你好，德弗罗医生。你好吗?
- Hiya, John. - Hiya, Dr. Devereaux. How are you?

828
01:11:19,233 --> 01:11:23,821
我在想我能不能见一下贝丝。
I was wondering if I could possibly see Beth for a moment.

829
01:11:30,077 --> 01:11:33,080
嗯,你看,约翰。
Um, look, John.

830
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:38,711
你看起来是个好孩子。这与个人无关。
You seem like a good kid. And this is nothing personal.

831
01:11:38,753 --> 01:11:42,423
但你现在的情况不太好。
But things aren't going too well for you right now.

832
01:11:42,507 --> 01:11:46,052
这种气氛对贝丝来说不健康。
And that's not a healthy atmosphere for Beth.

833
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,929
你明白吗?
Do you understand?

834
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:53,518
你能帮我把这些给贝丝吗?
Do you mind giving these to Beth for me?

835
01:11:53,601 --> 01:11:55,603
它们对我没什么用。
I don't have much use for 'em.

836
01:11:57,230 --> 01:11:59,190
谢谢你！
Thank you.

837
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:24,549
哦,嗨,约翰尼!
Oh, hi, Johnny!

838
01:12:25,925 --> 01:12:29,887
嗨,约翰!-他来了。你觉得怎么样?
- Hi, John! - There he is. Well, what do you think?

839
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:33,992
我以为你只是想把事情解决一下。
Well, I thought you were just gonna fix things up a bit.

840
01:12:34,016 --> 01:12:36,477
我不知道你会改变一切。
I didn't know you were gonna change everything.

841
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:39,730
这些东西都是今天送来的。我给你准备了一些惊喜。来吧。
All this stuff got here today. I got some surprises for you. Come on.

842
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:43,734
-上楼吧。——惊喜?
- Come on upstairs. - Surprises?

843
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,786
你重新装修了我整个房间?
You redecorated my whole room?

844
01:13:07,258 --> 01:13:10,511
-我在这里睡不着。——为什么不呢?
- I can't sleep in here. - Why not?

845
01:13:10,595 --> 01:13:13,681
我会醒来成为liberace。
I'll wake up and be liberace.

846
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:15,433
约翰尼。
Johnny.

847
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,768
任何一个孩子都想要这样的房间。
Any kid would kill to have a room like this.

848
01:13:17,852 --> 01:13:21,022
我的桌子怎么了?我的床和海报呢?
What happened to my desk? Where's my bed and my posters?

849
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,107
他们都在后面。我把它们扔了。
They're all out back. I threw em out.

850
01:13:23,190 --> 01:13:26,694
你可以把这里变成恩赐之地，我不在乎。
You can turn the rest of this place into Graceland, I don't care.

851
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:28,779
但我要把我的东西拿回来。
But I'm getting my stuff back.

852
01:13:29,906 --> 01:13:31,949
约翰尼。
Johnny.

853
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:35,494
——约翰尼。——哦,男人。
- Johnny. - Oh, man.

854
01:13:35,578 --> 01:13:37,788
-约翰尼，回来。——这是什么?
- Johnny, come back. - What's this?

855
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:40,833
我在跟你说话，强尼。
I'm talking to you, Johnny.

856
01:13:40,875 --> 01:13:42,835
哦!
Oh!

857
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,968
看看这张海报，伙计。这完全是毁了。
Look at this poster, man. It's totally ruined.

858
01:13:51,010 --> 01:13:55,056
-你不会想挂那种乐队的海报的。——为什么不呢?
- You don't wanna be hangin' up posters of them kind of bands. - Why not?

859
01:13:55,139 --> 01:13:57,058
他们中有一半是撒旦崇拜者。
Half of 'em are Satan worshipers.

860
01:13:57,141 --> 01:13:59,578
这就是查理·曼森砍人的时候听的音乐。
That's the kind of music Charlie manson was listenin' to when he hacked up those people.

861
01:13:59,602 --> 01:14:02,647
你听说过有人听了“惊慌失措”就犯下大屠杀吗?
You ever hear of anybody listen to “all shook up” and committin' mass murder?

862
01:14:04,023 --> 01:14:06,525
你疯了。你知道吗?
You're crazy. You know that?

863
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:11,656
——上帝!我怎么可能听你的?-你在说什么?
- God! How could I ever listen to you, huh? - What are you talkin' about?

864
01:14:11,697 --> 01:14:16,077
你说我可以爬上那座山的。你说过一切都会解决的。
You told me I could go up that hill. You said everything would work out.

865
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:21,666
但我早该知道。为什么现在会有什么不同呢?
But I should've known better. Why should anything be different now?

866
01:14:21,707 --> 01:14:25,920
我是说，我的音乐在学校格格不入。
I mean, my music doesn't fit in at school.

867
01:14:26,003 --> 01:14:29,507
我和我喜欢的女孩合不来。
I don't fit in with the girl I like.

868
01:14:29,590 --> 01:14:32,426
我甚至都不适应自己的家。
I don't even fit in in my own home.

869
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:40,559
——约翰尼?约翰尼?-不，不，让他走让他走。
- Johnny? Johnny? - No, no, let him go. Let him go.

870
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:46,065
让他发泄一下。来吧。
Let him blow off a little steam. Come on.

871
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,965
停止。
Stop.

872
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:26,313
你好。
Howdy.

873
01:15:30,401 --> 01:15:34,280
你妈妈告诉我你被才艺表演除名了。
Your mama told me you got cut from the talent show.

874
01:15:34,321 --> 01:15:36,782
她说这对你很重要。
She said it meant a lot to you.

875
01:15:36,824 --> 01:15:41,412
我只是想进来帮你唱歌。
I just thought maybe I'd come in here and help you with your song.

876
01:15:41,454 --> 01:15:46,083
-给你看看舞步。-我的动作怎么了?
- Show you some moves. - What's wrong with the way I move?

877
01:15:47,710 --> 01:15:51,088
你裤子里没有火啊。
Well, you got no fire in your pants.

878
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,257
你腰部以下已经死了。
You're just dead from the waist down.

879
01:15:53,340 --> 01:16:00,473
正确的。他想让我们塞裤子，扭屁股……为了让一群蓝发女士尖叫。
Right. He wants us to stuff our pants and wiggle our asses... To make a bunch of blue-haired ladies scream.

880
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,768
- - - - - -来吧。-我没塞裤子。上帝这样做。
- Come on. - Well, I didn't stuff my pants. God did that.

881
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:10,775
如果你对那些蓝头发的女士们置之不理也就是你的一部分观众，你永远也出不了这个车库。
And if you go turnin' your back on those blue-haired ladies... Which is part of your audience, you're never gonna get out of this garage.

882
01:16:10,858 --> 01:16:13,778
正确的。那你要教我们什么?如何做你自己?
Right. And what're you gonna teach us, huh? How to be you?

883
01:16:13,819 --> 01:16:17,156
如何玩维加斯?来吧,男人。
How to play Vegas? Come on, man.

884
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:21,285
你都快40岁了。你所知道的关于摇滚的一切都是乱世佳人。
You're almost 40 years old. Everything you knew about rock 'n' roll is gone with the wind.

885
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:23,913
我也是。
Me too.

886
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:31,837
你疯了吗?拒绝国王的免费建议?
Are you crazy? Turning down free advice from the king himself?

887
01:16:31,921 --> 01:16:34,632
他不是国王。
He's not the king.

888
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,675
不了。
Not anymore.

889
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:44,016
史蒂夫,这是他。
Steve, that's him.

890
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:46,727
-那是猫王!——哦。
- That's Elvis Presley! - Aw.

891
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,945
不可能。猫王有一头黑头发。
No way. Elvis has black hair.

892
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:58,864
-莫妮卡那天晚上在派对上看到他了。-绝对是他。
- Monica saw him at the party the other night. - It's definitely him.

893
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,991
我告诉你，就是他。
I'm telling you, it's him.

894
01:17:01,033 --> 01:17:03,869
如果是他，也许他会给我们唱首歌。
If it's him, then maybe he'll sing us a little song.

895
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:05,871
-史蒂夫，别这样。——不。
- Steve, come on. - Don't.

896
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,873
只是找点乐子，宝贝。
Just having a little fun, babe.

897
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:18,926
嘿,你!嘿,鬓角。

那边有个小妞想听你唱首歌。
I got a little chick over there wants to hear you sing a song.

899

Oh, yeah? Why don't you bring her to my concert in Pittsburgh on Sunday?

900
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:30,062
-你不会害怕吧?-我没那么说，对吧?
- You ain't scared, are ya? - I didn't say that, did I?

901
01:17:30,146 --> 01:17:33,691
-史蒂夫，你惹的麻烦已经够多了。-你为什么不闭嘴?
- Steve, you've caused enough trouble. - Why don't you shut up?

902
01:17:33,774 --> 01:17:37,027
嘿,嘿!我会唱歌。
Hey, hey! I'll sing.

903
01:17:37,111 --> 01:17:39,572

我经营一家汽车商店。

我猜他是黄色的。

皱纹在我的脸上和手上形成。

好了，大家都出去，除了你。你得待在车里。
Okay, everybody out, except you. You got to stay in the car.

940
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:40,854
你们经常打架吗?
Do you always get in fights?

941
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:44,316
我也无能为力了。有时候人们就是想打架。
Not any more than I can help it. Sometimes people just want to fight.

942
01:21:44,358 --> 01:21:46,652
——你明白吗?-是的。

我的一首歌出了点问题。

为什么,当然。我很乐意。

947
01:22:16,223 --> 01:22:21,103
万能的主啊，感受我的体温升高
Lord almighty feel my temperature risin'

948
01:22:22,855 --> 01:22:25,858
越烧越高，烧穿了我的鞋底。
higher, higher it's burnin' through to my soles.

949
01:22:25,899 --> 01:22:35,826
一个,两个……三、四……5、6……7、8。
One, two... Three, four... Five, six... Seven, eight.

950
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:40,080
现在慢慢来。两个。和去。
Now around real slow. Two. And go.

慢慢来。一件容易的事。
Come around real slow. Easy.

953
01:22:47,212 --> 01:22:49,173
就是这样。最后折断你的臀部。
That's it. Snap your hip at the end.

954
01:22:49,214 --> 01:22:51,133
-还不错。——我的手吗?
- Not too bad. - My hands?

955
01:22:51,216 --> 01:22:53,177
手放松。在这样的。
Hands are relaxed. Around like that.

956
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:56,805
两个,四个。
Two, and four.

957
01:22:56,889 --> 01:22:59,141
——好。这是好的。-说得不错。

958
01:23:01,852 --> 01:23:03,770

962
01:23:20,204 --> 01:23:23,415
我父亲的事我很抱歉。
I'm sorry about my father.

963
01:23:23,499 --> 01:23:27,419
他以为他能掌控我的生活，但他做不到。
He thinks he can run my life, but he cant.

964
01:23:27,503 --> 01:23:30,631
别担心。
Don't worry about that.

965
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:33,717
你想跟埃尔维斯谈谈吗，或者想要个签名?
Listen, you wanna talk to Elvis, or maybe get an autograph?

966
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:36,094

969
01:23:51,485 --> 01:23:54,071
-是的。-好吧，我们走。

继续。把它出来。

972
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:17,177
-这会杀了他们的，对吧?-哦,是的。
- This'll kill 'em, right? - Oh, yeah.

973
01:24:17,261 --> 01:24:21,765
-这能彻底摆脱他们吗?-一劳永逸。
- This'll get rid of them once and for all? - Once and for all.

974
01:24:27,354 --> 01:24:29,314
我不能。
I can't.

975
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:31,316
好吧,没关系。
Well, that's okay.

976
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:35,821
我想我只是让你知道你有更多的勇气。
I guess I just had you figured for havin' more guts than that.

977
01:24:36,947 --> 01:24:38,865
——晚安。——晚安。
- Good night. - Good night.

978
01:24:41,994 --> 01:24:43,954
猫王?
Elvis?

979
01:24:43,996 --> 01:24:46,039
是吗?
Yeah?

980

你把他带到这里的机会。

从来没有人为我做过这样的事。
Nobody's ever done anything like that for me.

985
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:22,492
我只是觉得你值得我这么做。

986
01:25:32,210 --> 01:25:36,340
——嘿,你看。看。到这里来。——什么?

帕姆家的灯熄了。

988
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:48,727
哦，你真了不起，普雷斯利先生。
Oh, you are something, Mr. Presley.

I know a place we can go. They'll never find us.

992
01:26:01,740 --> 01:26:03,700
——在哪里?你会划船吗?
- Where's that? - Can you row a boat?

993
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:06,536

你得离开这里。
You gotta get outta here.

999
01:27:23,989 --> 01:27:26,825
外面有一大群人，而且越来越多。
There's a crowd of people out front, and it's gettin' bigger.

Well, since my baby left me I found a new place to dwell.

And though it's always crowded you still can find some room for brokenhearted lovers.

1036

服务员的眼泪一直在流前台服务员穿着黑色衣服。
Well the bellhop's tears keep flowing the desk clerk's dressed in black.

1038

你有故事可讲。
And you've got a tale to tell.

1043
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:41,955
走在寂寞的街道上，去心碎的酒店。
Just take a walk down lonely street to heartbreak hotel.

-嘿，你剪头发了吗?-你去哪了，伙计?我们错过了你。
- Hey, did you get a haircut? - Where you been, man? We missed you.

Marie... I want you to know that if there was any way... - I could... - I know.

当我和你在一起的时候，我发现了一些我以为早已消失的东西。
When I was with you, I found somethin' I thought was long gone.

1059
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:57,549
我想留着它。
I want to hold on to it.

1060
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:03,680
我觉得如果我回到飞机上…它会再次从我身边溜走。
I feel like if I get back on that plane... It's gonna slip away from me again.

1061
01:34:05,807 --> 01:34:10,103
我会一直为你留一间空房间的。

01:34:42,051 --> 01:34:44,095
我会想你的。

1063
01:34:44,179 --> 01:34:50,810
我也会想你的…“因为我从来不知道有个爸爸是什么感觉。”
I'm gonna miss you too... "Cause I never knew what it was like to have a dad."

1064
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:53,938
现在我做的。

我马上就来。

1067
01:35:20,423 --> 01:35:23,301
我第一次见到你的时候，我一点都不喜欢你。
When I first met you, I didn't like you at all.

1068
01:35:23,384 --> 01:35:29,807
我以为你是最刻薄的…我见过最傲慢自私的小混蛋。
I thought you were the meanest... Most arrogant, selfish little bastard I'd ever met.

1069

然后想到你让我想起了我像你这么大的时候。
Then got to thinkin' how much you reminded me of me when I was your age.

1070
01:35:36,731 --> 01:35:40,401
我都忘了当个坏蛋，做个反叛者的感觉有多好了。
I forgot how good it felt to be a bad-ass, to be a rebel.

1071
01:35:43,529 --> 01:35:46,282
你让我觉得自己又像猫王了。
You made me feel like Elvis again.

1072
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,376
嘿,猫王。

1073
01:35:58,419 --> 01:36:01,965
谢谢你今晚。我知道你是为了我。
Thanks for tonight. I know you did that for me.

1074
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:05,551
地狱,不,孩子。我这样做是为了摇滚。
Hell, no, kid. I did it for rock 'n' roll.

1075
01:36:22,068 --> 01:36:23,486
嘿,猫王!
Hey, Elvis!

1076
01:36:26,030 --> 01:36:28,366
你还是国王。
You're still the king.

1077
01:36:31,369 --> 01:36:35,707
一定有更亮的灯。
There must be lights burning brighter.

1078
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,584
在某处。
Somewhere.

1079
01:36:38,668 --> 01:36:52,432
如果我能梦到一个更好的地方，在那里我所有的兄弟手牵手，我就能像鸟儿一样在更蓝的天空中飞得更高。
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue if I can dream of a better land where all my brothers walk hand-in-hand.

1080
01:36:53,933 --> 01:37:03,776
告诉我为什么，为什么，为什么，为什么我的梦想不能实现。
Tell me why oh, why, oh, why can't my dream come true.

1081
01:37:05,361 --> 01:37:08,781
哦,为什么。
Oh, why.

1082
01:37:08,865 --> 01:37:16,122
总会有和平与理解的时候。
There must be peace and understanding sometime.

1083
01:37:16,205 --> 01:37:24,005
承诺的强风，会吹走怀疑和恐惧。
Strong winds of promise, that will blow away the doubt and fear.

1084
01:37:24,088 --> 01:37:28,551
如果能梦见一个更温暖的太阳。
If can dream of a warmer sun.

1085
01:37:28,593 --> 01:37:32,013
在那里，希望一直照耀着每个人。
Where hope keeps shining on everyone.

1086
01:37:32,096 --> 01:37:42,774
告诉我为什么，为什么，为什么太阳不再出现……
Tell me why oh, why, oh, why won't that sun appear...

1087
01:37:48,946 --> 01:37:52,700
我们迷失在云中。
We're lost in a cloud.

1088
01:37:52,784 --> 01:37:56,579
雨水太多了。
With too much rain.

1089
01:37:56,621 --> 01:38:04,295
我们被困在一个充满痛苦的世界里。
We're trapped in a world that's troubled with pain.

1090
01:38:04,337 --> 01:38:06,589
但只要一个人。
But as long as a man.

1091
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:17,058
拥有梦想的力量…他可以救赎自己的灵魂，然后飞翔。
Has the strength to dream... He can redeem his soul and fly.

1092
01:38:22,063 --> 01:38:24,440
在我的内心深处。
Deep in my heart.

1093
01:38:24,482 --> 01:38:37,453
还有一个令人颤抖的问题，我确信答案，答案总会出现的。
There's a trembling question still I am sure that the answer's the answer's gonna come somehow.

1094
01:38:37,537 --> 01:38:40,998
在黑暗中。
Out there in the dark.

1095
01:38:41,082 --> 01:38:45,128
这是一个召唤蜡烛，是的。
There's a beckoning candle yeah.

1096
01:38:45,211 --> 01:39:00,977
只要我能思考，只要我能说话，只要我能站，只要我能走，只要我能做梦，我就能感受到我的梦想。
And while I can think while I can talk while I can stand while I can walk while I can dream I'm feelin' my dream.

1097
01:39:01,018 --> 01:39:03,146
成真。
Come true.

1098
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:05,606
哇。
Whoa.

1099
01:39:08,317 --> 01:39:12,238
现在。

哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

1102
01:39:32,049 --> 01:39:35,386
打破它，燃烧它。
Break it, burn it.

1103
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:46,856
到处拖着它，拧着它，转动它，你不能把它推倒，因为每一分钟每一小时。
Drag it all around, twist it, turn it, you can't tear it down 'cause every minute every hour.

1104
01:39:46,898 --> 01:39:52,904
你会被这种奇怪而强大的力量所震撼……我的爱。
You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power... Of my love.

1105
01:39:57,450 --> 01:40:00,495
粉碎它，踢它。
Crush it, kick it.

1106
01:40:00,578 --> 01:40:03,623
你永远赢不了。
You can never win.

1107
01:40:03,706 --> 01:40:06,876
不，宝贝，你不能舔它。
No, baby, you can't lick it.

1108
01:40:06,959 --> 01:40:09,879
我会让你走到最后。
I'll make you the end.

1109
01:40:09,921 --> 01:40:12,048
每一分钟每一小时。

你会被这种奇怪而强大的力量所震撼……我的爱。
You'll be shaken by the strange and mighty power... Of my love.

1111
01:40:21,891 --> 01:40:24,352
我说过每分钟每小时。

你会被这种奇怪而强大的力量所震撼……我的爱。
