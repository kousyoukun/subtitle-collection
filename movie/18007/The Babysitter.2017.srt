2
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,357
我告訴過你，我不想要打針。
I don't need it. I'm telling you.

3
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,027
就因為你現在不覺得噁心了，並不意味著你不需要注射。
Just because you don't feel sick now doesn't mean you don't need the shot.

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,989
我從不生病，好嗎？你可以拿去給巴里。
I never get sick, okay? You can take that and give it to Barry.

5
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,826
-他總是流鼻涕.。-你在這裏說什麼屁話？
-His nose is always running. -What are you giving me shit for?

6
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,787
我今天早些時候見過你。我們打了個招呼。我說“科爾”你說“黛西先生”
I saw you earlier today. We said hi. I said, "Cole." You said, "Mr. Daisy."

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,041
你今天到底怎麼了？我的意思是，這只是一根針而已，夥計。
Why are you giving me shit today? I mean, it's just a needle, man.

8
00:00:44,168 --> 00:00:47,172
該死，過來，打針。沒什麼可害怕的。
Damn. Come here, get the shot. Ain't nothing to be scared of.

9
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,758
有62個孩子已經打了，什麼問題都沒有。
There's 62 kids came here, got a shot, no problem.

10
00:00:50,841 --> 00:00:54,179
你都進來十分鐘了吧？外面還有84個孩子要我給他們打針。趕緊好嗎？
You come in here, take ten minutes? I got 84 kids more to go. Okay?

11
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,222
我們是男孩。冷靜點。靠，夥計。要拍這張照片嗎？
We're boys. Be cool. Shit, man. Are you gonna take this shot?

12
00:00:57,306 --> 00:01:00,310
到這邊來，照一照，就像你要拍屁股一樣。
Step over here and take the shot, just like you'd take some ass.

13
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,604
沒有什麼可害怕的。
There's nothing to be scared of.

14
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,355
我不害怕。
I'm not scared.

15
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,875
【風騷小保姆】

16
00:01:16,283 --> 00:01:17,869
娘炮！
Pussy!

17
00:01:27,294 --> 00:01:29,838
你知道五月花上只生了一個孩子嗎？
Did you know only one baby was born on the Mayflower?

18
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,050
那有多瘋狂？
How crazy is that shit?

19
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,719
他的名字，字面上叫歐瑪納斯。
His name was literally Oceanus.

20
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,513
他甚至沒有國籍。
He didn't even have a nationality.

21
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,972
我猜只是個海中公民。
Just a citizen of the sea, I guess.

22
00:01:39,765 --> 00:01:41,433
你在哪門課上學的這些？
What class did you learn that in?

23
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,188
沒有人能夠在課堂上學到這些東西。這是我在互聯網上學到的知識。
[scoffs] No one learns anything in class. That's why we have the Internet.

24
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,694
那是我爸爸。
There's my dad.

25
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:53,612
媚蘭，過來。
[Melanie's dad] Melanie, get over here.

26
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,531
這是他高中時的夢想之車.。
It was his high-school dream car.

27
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,536
離婚後他得到了它，讓媽媽很嫉妒，但是..。
He got it after the divorce to make Mom jealous, but...

28
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,205
-因為是輛車，所以也沒有什麼。- 現在。
-it didn't work because it's a car. -Now.

29
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,208
爸爸，我們能送科爾回家嗎？
Dad, can we give Cole a ride home?

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,753
科爾，你父母在等你坐公共汽車回家嗎？
Cole, are your parents expecting you to take the bus home?

31
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,548
-我猜是的.。-是的，他們是。
-I guess so. -Yeah, they are.

32
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,550
那麼，你應該坐公共汽車，好嗎，夥計？
So, you should take the bus, okay, sport?

33
00:02:14,925 --> 00:02:17,177
抱歉，夥計。不過，我們再見，鄰居，嗯？
Sorry, dude. I'll see you, though, neighbor, huh?

34
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,888
-我沒有----那是什麼？
-I didn't-- -What's that?

35
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,768
-國家賽車協會，賤人。哇！- 爸爸-。
-NASCAR Nation, bitch. Whoo! -[Melanie] Dad--

36
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,272
爸爸！
[Melanie] Dad!

37
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:46,498
噢--哇，噢--哇。哇，哇-哇.。
[Jeremy] Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah.

38
00:02:46,582 --> 00:02:47,876
喔 喔 喔
Well, well, well.

39
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,128
嘿，結腸鏡檢查。檢查得怎麼樣？
[Jeremy] Hey, Colonoscopy. How's it hanging?

40
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,755
我不知道。好嗎？
I don't know. Okay?

41
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:56,300
說到結腸鏡檢查，檢查的時候你的蛋蛋掉下來了嗎？
Well, speaking of hanging, have your balls dropped yet?

42
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,055
我沒聽明白。
I didn't catch that.

43
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:05,684
我說：“你為什麼對我的蛋蛋那麼感興趣？”
I said, "Why are you so interested in my balls?"

44
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,645
他最不關心的就是你的蛋蛋。
Last thing he cares about is your balls.

45
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,481
是的，因為星期六，我和雪麗·麥肯太爾上了床。
[Jeremy] Yeah, 'cause on Saturday, I hooked up with Shelly MacEntyre.

46
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,399
大二的時候？
The sophomore?

47
00:03:11,899 --> 00:03:15,110
大二，但在很多方面，她都是大四學生。
The sophomore. But in many ways, she was a senior.

48
00:03:15,736 --> 00:03:18,197
-我不相信你。-你不需要相信他。
-I don't believe you. -You don't need to believe him.

49
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,908
這並不是你說不相信，就不是真的。
It's not like your belief will validate what happens to his dick.

50
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,035
想知道是怎麼回事嗎？
Wanna know how it was?

51
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,496
不，不是真的。
No, not really.

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,998
嗯，你看，作為一個14歲的孩子，在那種情況下。
Well, see, as a 14-year-old in that kind of situation

53
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,501
一個16歲的孩子看起來像雪麗·麥肯太爾。
with a 16-year-old that looks like Shelly MacEntyre,

54
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,128
實在是讓人無法拒絕那種誘惑。
it was overwhelming, man.

55
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:34,296
她是個女人。
I mean, she is a woman.

56
00:03:35,255 --> 00:03:37,966
完全成熟了，夥計。太瘋狂了，夥計。這是... 。
Fully-developed, man. It's crazy, man. It's... [grunts]

57
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,593
老兄，你知道我在說什麼嗎？
Man, you know what I'm saying?

58
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,389
我說，你知道我在說什麼嗎？
I said, do you know what I'm saying?

59
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,725
你剛才說，我信不信你沒關係。
You just said it didn't matter if I believed you.

60
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,938
-嗯，我改變主意了，賤人.。-對不起，我不是-。
-Well, I changed my mind, bitch. -Sorry, I wasn't--

61
00:03:52,522 --> 00:03:54,858
噢，天啊，他好弱。
[Jeremy] Oh, my God. He's so weird. [laughs]

62
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,445
哇，哇-哇.。哇，哇-哇.。
Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah.

63
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,363
嘿！
[woman] Hey!

64
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,746
剛才是你把科爾推倒在地上的嗎？
Did you just touch Cole?

65
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,541
-那如果是我呢？- 傑瑞米，過來看看。
-So, what if I did? -[woman] Jeremy, check it out.

66
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,628
再想想科爾..。
You so much as think about Cole again...

67
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,048
而我要...
and I'm gonna...

68
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,263
瘋婊子。
You crazy bitch.

69
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,225
♪女孩子們想成為她 ♪。
♪ The girls wanna be her ♪

70
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,184
-現在趕緊滾！
-Now get out of here!

71
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,187
在我要揍你之前，你這個小王八蛋
Before I run you over, you little Pap smear.

72
00:04:34,898 --> 00:04:36,484
-嘿，科利. - 嘿，比。
-Hey, Coley. -[Cole] Hey, Bee.

73
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,903
這是新的眼鏡。
These are new.

74
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,824
是的，我有時得戴上它。
Yeah, I have to wear them sometimes.

75
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,325
據說它們能增強我的左眼。
They supposedly help strengthen my left eye,

76
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,621
-但我看不出有什麼區別.。-對我來說，你看上去很強壯.。
-but I can't tell the difference. -You look pretty strong to me.

77
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,790
手掌擦破皮了？
You skin your palms?

78
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:53,917
-不痛.。-是的，是的.。到這兒來。
-It doesn't hurt. -Yeah, it does. Come here.

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,511
-他們經常欺負你是不是？-不是。
-They bother you a lot? -No.

80
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,475
撒謊的時候你會轉移視線，老兄。是那些經常扔雞蛋到你家裏的人嗎？
You look away when you lie, dude. They the ones that egg your house?

81
00:05:11,977 --> 00:05:15,398
你得打他們的雞巴。
You gotta punch them in the dick.

82
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,776
如果他們在追你，等他們快抓到你了。
And if they're chasing you, wait until they've almost got you,

83
00:05:18,859 --> 00:05:21,446
像一袋石頭一樣摔倒下來，然後當他們絆到你時，
drop like a bag of rocks, then when they trip over you,

84
00:05:21,528 --> 00:05:23,989
他們就在撲倒在地上，然後你去踢他們的雞巴。
and they're on the ground, kick them in the dick.

85
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,204
-嘿，那麼，告訴我，大家都好嗎？-很好，我想。
-Hey, so, tell me, how's the folks? -Better, I think.

86
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:32,165
在酒店工作怎麼樣？
Hotel therapy's working?

87
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,041
不，別這樣，太棒了。
No, come on, it's great.

88
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,045
我的意思是，他們很高興，我們可以出去玩，而我得到報酬。
I mean, they're happy, we get to hang out, and I get paid.

89
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,339
-我就像你的小新教徒。- 什麼？
-I'm like your little Protestant. -[chuckles] What?

90
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,800
因為，我得付錢讓你跟我出去玩。
'Cause, like, I have to pay you to hang out with me.

91
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,095
是不是想說“妓女”？
Are you trying to say "prostitute"?

92
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,513
天哪-。
Oh, my God--

93
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:50,808
不，那會讓我成為妓女，讓你的父母成為客戶。
No, that would make me the prostitute and your parents the clients.

94
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,269
這是一個可怕的比喻。這是有史以來最糟糕的一次。
That is a terrible analogy. That is the worst one ever.

95
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,605
-哦...-此外。
-Oh... -Besides,

96
00:05:55,687 --> 00:05:57,606
不管怎麼說，我都想和你在一起。
I'd wanna hang out with you either way.

97
00:05:58,356 --> 00:05:59,191
真的?。
Really?

98
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,984
百分之百。
One hundred percent.

99
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,572
在你太酷不能和我一起玩之前，我最多有兩年的時間。
I got two years tops before you're too cool to hang out with me.

100
00:06:05,947 --> 00:06:07,532
我永遠不會太酷。
I'll never be too cool.

101
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,705
嘿，那是你樹屋的屋頂嗎？
Hey, is that the roof of your tree house?

102
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,708
是的，我們剛開始把它取下來。
[Cole] Yeah, we just started to take it down.

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,710
--我--我不在乎。我是說，我的，呃-。
I-- I don't care. I mean, my, uh--

104
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,588
反正樹屋是給孩子的。
Tree houses are for kids anyway.

105
00:06:21,588 --> 00:06:23,757
裏面有很多美好的回憶，對吧？
There's a lot of good memories in there, right?

106
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,218
嗯。
Yeah.

107
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,971
明晚。你，我，派對。
All right, tomorrow night. You. Me. Party.

108
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,640
聽起來不錯。
Sounds good.

109
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,110
手指。
E.T. fingers.

110
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,407
-好的.。再見，-再見，蜜蜂。
-All right. See you, Cee. -Bye-bye, Bee.

111
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:54,622
得把門修好。你還把這個給我，對嗎？
Gotta get that door fixed. You're still giving this to me, right?

112
00:06:54,704 --> 00:06:57,625
-百分之百。-不能在我的車上有粘粘的門.。
-One hundred percent. -Can't have a sticky door on my car.

113
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,484
媽媽！
Hey, Mom!

114
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,361
嘿！科爾。
[Mom] Hey! Cole.

115
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,407
科爾，你能給我一個老鼠夾嗎？
Cole, can you hand me one of those traps, please?

116
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,075
給你。
Ow.

117
00:07:32,951 --> 00:07:34,286
-謝謝.。你好，-你好。
-Thanks. Hi. -Hi.

118
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,997
謝謝你，兄弟。
[grunts] Thanks, buddy.

119
00:07:37,747 --> 00:07:39,959
上帝，上帝。
God. God.

120
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,587
媽媽，你怎麼會在下面？下麵看起來會有一萬億隻蜘蛛。
Mom, how can you be under there? There's like a trillion spiders.

121
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,466
科爾，我不喜歡這裏。這下麵最糟糕了。
[Mom] Cole, I don't like it under here. It's pretty much the worst.

122
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:49,593
-媽媽，你認為我是個娘炮嗎？- 啊。
-Do you think I'm a pussy, Mom? -[thud] Ow.

123
00:07:50,135 --> 00:07:51,678
你知道那個詞的意思嗎？
[Mom] Do you know what that word means?

124
00:07:51,761 --> 00:07:53,597
是的，就像，不像男人，什麼都怕。-噢.。
-[Cole] Yeah, like, afraid of everything. -Ow.

125
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:56,016
嗯..。
Um...

126
00:07:56,558 --> 00:07:57,476
哈。
Huh.

127
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,437
呃..
Well... [sighs]

128
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,526
我覺得...你在你的生命中。
I think... you are at a time in your life

129
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:08,446
很多事情都很可怕。
where a lot of things are scary.

130
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:13,743
但隨著年齡的增長，同樣的事情也會停止讓你害怕。
But as you get older, those same things will stop frightening you as much.

131
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,161
好吧。
Okay?

132
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,830
一切都會好起來的。
It's gonna be okay.

133
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,169
你真應該弄點噴霧劑來殺死裏面的蜘蛛。
[Cole] You should really get some bug spray to kill the spiders in there.

134
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,506
他們對你們做了什麼？他們吃其他的髒蟲子。
What have they done to you? They eat other dirty bugs.

135
00:08:26,588 --> 00:08:28,256
嘿，你能給我來杯檸檬水嗎？
Hey, will you get me a lemonade?

136
00:08:28,507 --> 00:08:29,342
-是的.。-謝謝.。
-Yep. -Thanks.

137
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,596
媽媽，我知道“娘炮”也是“陰道”的意思。我不是弱智。
Mom, I know "pussy" also means "vagina." I'm not retarded.

138
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:40,435
科爾·詹森。別說“弱智”
Cole Johnson. Do not say "retarded."

139
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,021
-但是我可以說“娘炮”或“陰道”--“
-But I can say "pussy" or "vagi--"

140
00:08:43,104 --> 00:08:44,231
別說了，好嗎？
Don't say it, okay?

141
00:08:44,773 --> 00:08:45,815
去拿檸檬水給我。
Go get me a lemonade.

142
00:08:50,278 --> 00:08:51,656
天啊，他說“娘炮”
Oh, my God, he said "pussy."

143
00:08:52,614 --> 00:08:54,242
吸氣。呼出。
[man] Breathe in. Breathe out.

144
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,827
放鬆。- 好的。
-Unclench that sphincter. -[Cole] Okay.

145
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,413
-帶著眼鏡看的清晰嗎？-看起來不錯.。
-How those mirrors looking? -Looking good.

146
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,372
刹車？
Parking brakes?

147
00:09:01,331 --> 00:09:02,166
沒有。
Nope.

148
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,293
-雙手？-十和二。
-Hands? -Ten and two.

149
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:05,877
開始。
Engage.

150
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,304
爸爸，你知道嗎，每天有七個青少年死於開車？
Dad, did you know that seven teenagers die a day from driving?

151
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:17,138
真的?哇。
Really? Wow.

152
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,851
你知道嗎，呃，每天有14名青少年死於過度擔憂？
Did you know that, uh, 14 teenagers die a day from over-worrying?

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,562
我上網了。
I went on the Internet,

154
00:09:23,645 --> 00:09:26,106
還有他們的照片。他們是這樣死的。
and there's pictures of them. They die like this:

155
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,278
或許下個星期。
Maybe next week.

156
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:34,114
好吧，兄弟，當然。想交換嗎？
All right, buddy, sure. You wanna swap?

157
00:09:34,656 --> 00:09:36,450
-是的.。-很好。明白了。做得很好。
-Yeah. -Good. All right. You did good.

158
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,703
你發動汽車，系上安全帶。
You started the car, you put the seat belt on.

159
00:09:39,786 --> 00:09:42,122
別擔心，夥計。不急。
Don't worry about it, pal. There's no rush.

160
00:09:42,205 --> 00:09:44,916
害怕是可以的。沒什麼大不了的，好嗎？
It's okay to be scared. It's not a big deal, okay?

161
00:09:47,294 --> 00:09:49,671
嘿，我問你個問題。做你的朋友-。
Hey, let me ask you something. Do your friends--

162
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,049
他們會因為你有保姆而取笑你嗎？
Do they make fun of you for having a babysitter?

163
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:53,426
對。
Yeah.

164
00:09:53,883 --> 00:09:56,012
但後來他們看到了她，就開始嫉妒了。
But then they see her and get really jealous.

165
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,806
是的，該死，是的，他們知道。
Yeah. Heck, yeah, they do. [chuckles]

166
00:09:58,888 --> 00:10:01,851
我不知道你的情況，夥計，但我覺得自己像個員警。
I don't know about you, buddy, but I'm feeling like a cop.

167
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,145
我想要一些甜甜圈。
I'm craving some donuts.

168
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,729


169
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:08,940
好的！
[Dad] All right!

170
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:12,653

171
00:10:18,408 --> 00:10:19,452
看什麼呢？
What are you watching?

172
00:10:19,534 --> 00:10:21,828
你爸爸在為瘋狂廣告人節目而大發雷霆。
Your dad is bingeing on Mad Men.

173
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:22,872
又來了。
Again.

174
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,372
你不會喜歡的。
You wouldn't like it.

175
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,125
HBO上有嗎？
It's on HBO?

176
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,794
不，不是--不是很黃很暴力的東西，夥計。
-[chuckles] -No, it's not-- It's not dirty, buddy.

177
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:29,754
不在HBO頻道上。
It's not on HBO.

178
00:10:29,836 --> 00:10:32,255
有很多季很多集，你知道的。所以，它可能會看的你頭疼。
It's dense, you know. So, it might go over your head.

179
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,091
等你長大一點，我們可以一起看。
When you get a little older, we'll binge-watch it together.

180
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,052
在那怎麼樣？
How about that?

181
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,971
好的。-科爾，你能清理一下玩具嗎？
-[Cole] All right. -Cole, will you clean up the toys

182
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:40,138
在走廊上那些？
in the hallway for me?

183
00:10:40,221 --> 00:10:41,557
好吧，媽媽，天啊。
Okay, Mom. Jeez.

184
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,474
謝謝。
Thank you.

185
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,606
乾淨多了。
[Cole] Much cleaner.

186
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,341
管他呢？
Who cares?

187
00:11:16,674 --> 00:11:17,510
嘿，哦。
Hey. Oh.

188
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,762
嘿，那看起來一點也不安全。
Hey, that doesn't seem safe at all.

189
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,638
-我能應付.。-是的.。不，我明白。
-I can handle it. -Yeah. No, I get it.

190
00:11:21,721 --> 00:11:22,640
停下，停下。
Stop. Stop.

191
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,265
把刀遞給我。
And hand me the knife.

192
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,020
太棒了。你為什麼用刀把車割開？
Fabulous. Why you cutting up your car with a knife?

193
00:11:28,812 --> 00:11:30,731
我要把車頂換個靠背，
I'm gonna switch the roof with a fastback,

194
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,023
-所以是空氣動力學的。嗯-嗯。
-so it's aerodynamic. -Uh-huh.

195
00:11:32,107 --> 00:11:34,276
它會使我在轉彎時更有力。
It's gonna give me more downforce on the turns.

196
00:11:34,359 --> 00:11:36,361
當它撞到坡道時，它就會翻滾。
When it hits the ramp, it'll do a barrel roll

197
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,822
並按我的計畫撞進墜機區-。
and smash into the crash zone exactly how I intend--

198
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,617
明白明白。我讚揚你對空氣動力學的熱情。
Got it, got it. I applaud your passion for aerodynamics.

199
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,828
我當然喜歡，但只有在你切牛排的時候才用的到這個。
I absolutely do, but only use this if you're cutting a flank steak.

200
00:11:44,911 --> 00:11:46,455
別那麼做。那是我的工作。
And don't do that. That's my job.

201
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,291
如果你這都已經會弄了，在這個家我還能夠做什麼？
And if you take that job, what am I doing at this house?

202
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,252
要我把它放回去嗎？
Do you want me to put it back?

203
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,961
不，我要把這個放在洗碗機裏。
[Dad] No. I'm gonna put this in the dishwasher,

204
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:55,171
因為它已經粘上了我的汗水弄髒了。
'cause it's coated in my sweat and fear.

205
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,343
父母又要去旅行了。我覺得他們目的是為了做愛。
My parents are going away again. I think they go to have sex,

206
00:12:00,427 --> 00:12:03,346
但這讓我覺得他們想要離開我。
but it just makes me feel like they go to get away from me.

207
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,974
他們肯定在做愛。
They're definitely having sex.

208
00:12:06,057 --> 00:12:07,934
他們可能也會在你回家的時候發生性關係。
They probably have sex when you're home, too.

209
00:12:08,435 --> 00:12:12,064
另外，我打賭蜜蜂也會帶男孩子在你的地方一直在做愛。
Besides, I bet Bee has boys over at your place all the time doing it.

210
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,190
不，不。
Nope. No.

211
00:12:13,273 --> 00:12:14,567
不行!不可能。
No way. Not a chance.

212
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,403
是的，保姆就是這麼做的。
Yeah. That's what babysitters do.

213
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:21,656
他們把孩子們放下來，把他們的男朋友偷偷帶進來。然後做愛。
They put the kids down, sneak their boyfriends in. Doing it.

214
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,744
說真的，她睡著後你有沒有醒過？
Seriously, have you ever been awake after she's fallen asleep?

215
00:12:26,536 --> 00:12:28,955
我敢說，如果今天晚上你不睡覺，你就知道是怎麼回事了。
I dare you to stay up tonight. You'll see.

216
00:12:29,914 --> 00:12:31,166
我會發現的。
I'm gonna find out.

217
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:34,002
-Perv。-不！我要窒息了！
-Perv. -No! I'm choking!

218
00:12:34,127 --> 00:12:35,629


219
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,296
娘炮！
Pussy!

220
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,468
親愛的，我不是在催你，但我們不是應該在五點離開嗎？
Honey, not that I'm rushing you, but weren't we supposed to leave at five?

221
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,596
不，親愛的，為了避免假日交通。
[Mom] No, honey, 5:30 to avoid holiday traffic.

222
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,181
我們本該在五點離開的。
We were supposed to leave at five.

223
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,849
不要移動傢俱。我們剛把地板擦乾淨。
Don't move the furniture around. We just did the floors.

224
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,851
-我不想讓你媽媽大喊大叫。- 明白了。
-I don't want your mom yelling. -[Cole] Got it.

225
00:13:31,935 --> 00:13:34,521
我不對你大喊大叫。我只會用大寫字母說話。
I don't yell at you. I just speak in all caps.

226
00:13:34,604 --> 00:13:36,315
對，這就是我喜歡她的地方。
Right. That's what I love about her.

227
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,609
-這裏。拿著這個。可能是蜜蜂。
-[doorbell rings] -Here. Get that. It's probably Bee.

228
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,609
好的。
Okay.

229
00:13:40,068 --> 00:13:41,986
你能快點嗎？- 是的。
Can you hurry up? - Yes.

230
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,663
-怎麼了，希？-什麼事，比？
-What up, Cee? -What up, Bee?

231
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,750
嘿，蜜蜂，你好嗎？-哦，你知道，不能抱怨。
-[Mom] Hey, Bee. How are you? -Oh, you know, can't complain.

232
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,502
很好，-這個週末去哪兒。
-[Mom] Good. -Where to this weekend?

233
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,879
-呃... 凱悅酒店。大酒店。-嗯！
-Uh... The Hyatt. Living large. -Mm!

234
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,796
找不到！
[Dad] Can't find it!

235
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,841
呃，試試你的內衣褲下面的抽屜。
Uh, try the bottom drawer under your Invisalign.

236
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,260
反正你知道怎麼做的了。
Um, anyway, you know the drill.

237
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:08,138
沒有暴力電影，沒有垃圾食品，十點前睡覺。
No violent movies, no junk food, bed by ten.

238
00:14:08,221 --> 00:14:09,932
媽媽，-10點30分前上床嗎。
-[Cole] Mom. -Bed by 10:30?

239
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,559
你是認真的嗎？- 還有別的嗎？
-[Cole] You serious? -[Bee] Anything else?

240
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,768
臥室裏沒有泳衣。
Uh, there is not a bathing suit in that bedroom.

241
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,187
那麼，親愛的，我不知道該告訴你什麼。
[Mom] Then, honey, I don't know what to tell you.

242
00:14:16,271 --> 00:14:17,481
-我不在上面。- 好的。
-I'm not up there. -[Dad] Okay.

243
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:22,111
-他肯定會帶著他的牛仔褲短褲。- 媽媽，他叫他們小丑。
-He's totally gonna bring his jean shorts. -[Cole] Mom, he calls them jorts.

244
00:14:22,193 --> 00:14:25,531
-嗯，我們會沒事的.。我能應付他的。-我知道。你是最棒的。
-Well, we'll be fine. I can handle him. -I know. You're the best.

245
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,200
- 我帶著我的軍裝。-我就知道！
-[Dad] I'm bringing my jorts. -[Mom] I knew it!

246
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,953
- 我帶著我的軍裝。-我就知道.。太棒了。
-[Dad] I'm bringing my jorts. -I knew it. Great.

247
00:14:31,369 --> 00:14:33,414
我會成為世界各地女人羡慕的對象。
I will be the envy of women everywhere.

248
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,958
嘿，嗯，蜜蜂，如果有麻煩，給我們打電話，好嗎？
Hey, uh, Bee, call us if there's any trouble, okay?

249
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,085
-科爾，別惹麻煩了。- 爸爸，我知道。
-Cole, don't cause any trouble. -[Cole] Dad, I know.

250
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,544
知道嗎，親愛的？
You know what, honey?

251
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,463
-你注射了流感疫苗，所以不要用力。-媽媽。
-You got your flu shot, so no exertion. -[Cole] Mom.

252
00:14:42,547 --> 00:14:45,008
-是的，不能到處跑.。棋盤遊戲。- 明白了。好吧。
-Yeah, no running around. Board games. -[Cole] Got it. Okay?

253
00:14:47,093 --> 00:14:50,263
嘿，科爾，記住，你現在是家裏的人了。
Hey, Cole, remember, you're the man of the house now.

254
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:51,848
太貼心了。就是你。
That's sweet. You are.

255
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,018
-我們愛你.。再見，比，-我愛你。玩得開心!。
-We love you. Bye, Bee. -I love you. Have fun.

256
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,270
- 但別太開心。-不要太多。
-[Dad] But not too much fun. -[Mom] Not too much.

你潛水不可能有我厲害的。
[Cole] No way you're gonna beat my dive.

266
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,408
所以，你基本上是說，星際夢之隊在執行任務。
So, you're basically saying, intergalactic dream team on a mission.

267
00:15:52,492 --> 00:15:56,038
-是的.。所以，有一個史詩反派，對嗎？-沒錯.。
-Yeah. So, there's an epic villain, right? -Right.

268
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,164
好吧，那麼，你必須填滿一艘星際飛船..。
Okay, so, you have to fill a starship...

269
00:15:58,831 --> 00:16:03,294
充滿了最好的人、外星人或機器人來把他們打倒。
full of the best people or aliens or robots to take them down.

00:16:05,171 --> 00:16:07,466
-五個？-六，如果你需要一個二重唱的話。
-Five? -Six, if you need, like, a duo.

272
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,510
但是你不能有捕食者和異形。
But you can't have a Predator and Xenomorph.

273
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,387
他們會打架的。任務是徒勞的。
They'd fight. The mission would be futile.

274
00:16:11,469 --> 00:16:12,804
不，不，好吧，我明白了。
No, no, okay, I get it.

275
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,099
明白了。一..柯克。
All right. One... Kirk.

276
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:17,226
二，皮卡德。
Two, Picard.

277

五，裏普利，六..。準備好了嗎？
Five, Ripley, and six... Are you ready for this shit?

279
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,859
一個異形卵。
A Xenomorph egg.

280
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,236
-不行.。-是的.。
-No way. -Yeah.

281
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:31,781
是的，是的，好的，這是計畫。
Yes. Yes. Okay. Here's the plan.

282
00:16:31,864 --> 00:16:34,702
柯克和皮卡德隊向隊長靠近，然後當他們接近時，
Kirk and Picard team up to captain, then when they get close,

283
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:37,120
他們派威爾和戈德布盧姆到巢穴裏去。
they send Will and Goldblum to get inside the lair.

284
00:16:37,203 --> 00:16:39,122
-他們有這方面的經驗。-公平。
-They have experience with that. -Fair.

285
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:41,666
裏普利一直在抱怨
Now, this whole time, Ripley's been bitching

286
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,794
關於異形蛋和狗屎，因為這是她的舉動。
about the Xenomorph egg and shit, 'cause that's her move.

287
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,130
但她必須這麼做。
But she's gotta do this.

288
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,590
-這是拯救世界的唯一方法.。-宇宙。
-It's the only way to save the world. -The universe.

289
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,549
對。一點兒沒錯。
Right! Exactly!

290
00:16:49,632 --> 00:16:52,593
威爾和戈德布盧姆把她弄進巢穴。
So, Will and Goldblum get her inside the lair.

291
00:16:52,677 --> 00:16:57,015
裏普利親自下蛋，臉擁抱者攻擊大壞蛋！
Ripley personally drops off the egg, the facehugger attacks the big bad!

292
00:16:57,265 --> 00:17:00,393
裏普利回到威爾和戈德布盧姆，大壞蛋襲擊他們，
Ripley makes it back to Will and Goldblum, the big bad attacks them,

293
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:01,979
他們險些逃脫。
they narrowly escape.

294
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,107
柯克和皮卡德補給罩，當航天器返回家園，
Kirk and Picard supply cover as the spacecraft returns home,

295
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,444
然後他們從那裏平靜下來。與此同時，大壞蛋開始感覺像屎一樣..。
then they peace out of there. Meanwhile, the big bad starts feeling like shit...

296
00:17:09,527 --> 00:17:12,072


297
00:17:14,449 --> 00:17:15,284
他出局了！
He's out!

298
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:21,498
誰說他是他？
Who said he was a he?

299
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,378
-閉嘴.。一個女人剛剛拯救了銀河系。-面孔擁抱者是女性嗎？
-Shut up. A woman just saved the galaxy. -Are facehuggers female?

300
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,171
不因為他們有雞巴。
No, 'cause they got dicks.

301
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,090
哦，你是說，拯救銀河系需要一根雞巴。
Oh, so, you're saying it took a dick to save the galaxy.

302
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,135
-我想要一份工作.。-
-I want a do-over. -

303
00:17:34,969 --> 00:17:36,889
-我想要一份工作.。-不行-翻過來。
-I want a do-over. -No do-overs.

304
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,391
來吧(趕快)。外星人不遵守我們原始的性別刻板印象。
Come on. Aliens don't abide by our primitive gender stereotypes.

305
00:17:40,475 --> 00:17:42,352
-做的都做完了.。-你真爛.。
-What's done is done. -You suck.

306
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:47,149
-你真爛，我希望你死掉。-沒有我你活不下去
-You suck, and I hope you die. -You couldn't live without me.

307
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,568
這肯定會影響我的收入。那麼，你可能是對的。
It would definitely affect my income. So, you're probably right.

308
00:17:50,651 --> 00:17:51,487


309
00:17:51,569 --> 00:17:53,113
-比薩！-比薩！
-Pizza! -Pizza!

310
00:17:54,989 --> 00:17:59,828
大印度酋長。如此特別。所以淩駕於法律之上。
[Bee and actor 1] Big Indian Chief. So special. So above the law.

311
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:03,248
我告訴過你，你會犯錯誤的，我會等你。
I told you, you'd make a mistake, and I'd be waiting.

312
00:18:05,416 --> 00:18:09,254
看起來我別無選擇，是嗎？
[Cole and actor 2] It doesn't look like I have any choice, does it?

313
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,881
對。不知道。
[Bee and actor 1 laugh] That's right. You don't.

314
00:18:12,381 --> 00:18:14,635
我要把這個右腳...。
[Cole and actor 2] I'm gonna take this right foot...

315
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:19,932
而我要在你的臉的那一邊打你。
and I'm gonna whop you on that side of your face.

316
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:22,600
想知道什麼嗎？
And you wanna know something?

317
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,770
對此你什麼也做不了。
There's not a damn thing you're gonna be able to do about it.

318
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:28,607
真的嗎？- [科爾和演員2]真的。
-[Bee and actor 1] Really? -[Cole and actor 2] Really.

319
00:18:32,068 --> 00:18:33,612
殺死那個印度狗娘養的。
Kill that Indian son of a bitch.

320
00:18:42,745 --> 00:18:44,873
覺得我父母會離婚嗎？
Think my parents are gonna get a divorce?

321
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,751
我不知道，夥計。我真希望不是這樣。
I don't know, man. I hope not.

322
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,630
梅勒妮的父母離婚了。她媽媽和她男朋友住在一起。
Melanie's parents got divorced. Her mom lives with her boyfriend.

323
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:53,798
那真噁心。
That's gross.

324
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,468
那不是街對面那個可愛的女孩嗎？
Isn't that the cute chick across the street?

325
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,430
德雷爾女士不可愛。她真噁心。
Ms. Dryer is not cute. She's gross.

326
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,848
她男朋友差不多20歲了。
Her boyfriend's like 20.

327
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,517
不是她。媚蘭。
Not her. Melanie.

328
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,229
我不會說她很可愛。
I wouldn't say she's cute.

329
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:11,066
哦，我會的。我覺得她超可愛。
Oh, I would. I would say she's super-duper cute.

330
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,318
我知道你想做什麼。不會成功的。
[stammers] I see what you're trying to do. It's not gonna work.

331
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:16,488
隨便啦。你想讓你的舌頭去舔她。
Whatever. You want your tongues to touch.

332
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,072
不，不可能。
Nope. No way.

333
00:19:18,156 --> 00:19:21,076
-哦，你在否認。-你是個...混蛋。
-Oh, you're in denial. -You're an... asshole.

334
00:19:23,244 --> 00:19:24,996
天啊，太棒了。
Oh, my God. That was so great.

335
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,542
但如果你父母分手，你會沒事的。
But you'll be all right if your parents break up.

336
00:19:29,625 --> 00:19:32,588
我是說...你得照顧好自己。
I mean... you just gotta take care of yourself.

337
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,508
先找出你想要的，然後盡你所能去得到它。
Gotta figure out what you want, and then do what you can to get it.

338
00:19:45,224 --> 00:19:46,560
啊，該死的，夥計，已經很晚了。
Ah, shit, dude, it's super late.

339
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,396
-我不累。-嗯，我知道你不累。是的。
-I'm not tired. -Well, I know you're not. I am.

340
00:19:51,772 --> 00:19:54,442
如果我給你一次機會，你會上床睡覺嗎？
[snaps fingers] If I give you a shot, will you go to bed?

341
00:19:55,735 --> 00:19:58,405
-我不知道。-也許，我有兩個方法。
-I don't know, maybe. -I'll make it a double.

342
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,240
-你會睡得像塊石頭。-好的.。
-You'll sleep like a rock. -Okay.

343
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,286
給你，我的好先生。
Here you are, my good sir.

344
00:20:06,078 --> 00:20:08,040
不要對你的父母說這件事。
Don't say a word of this to your parents.

345
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,500
爸爸一直讓我喝麥克的酒。
My dad lets me drink Mike's all the time.

346
00:20:11,584 --> 00:20:13,962
老兄，這是我一生中聽過的最酷的事情。
Dude, that is the coolest thing I've ever heard in my life.

347
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,469
難道你不來一杯？
You're not gonna do it with me?

348
00:20:23,137 --> 00:20:25,057
行，當然。馬上回來。
All right, sure. I'll be right back.

349
00:20:47,703 --> 00:20:48,913
難道你已經喝了？趁我不在的時候。
You did it without me?

350
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,250
乾杯！
Cheers.

351
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:54,336
哇。
Whew.

352
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,339
她要上床了。
She's getting laid. -[chuckles]

353
00:20:58,422 --> 00:21:00,717
-我會發現的。-哇，想想都刺激。
-I'm gonna find out. -Wow, I'm impressed.

354
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,344
但是，偷看別人做愛，好像不太好。
That's actually pervy, though, watching people do it.

355
00:21:03,427 --> 00:21:06,640
我不是變態。我只是想知道我睡覺後會發生什麼。
I'm not a perv. I just wanna know what happens after I go to sleep.

356
00:21:08,724 --> 00:21:09,600
我得掛了。
I gotta go.

357
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,063
不
-No.

358
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,359
請進。
Enter.

359
00:21:19,026 --> 00:21:19,860
困嗎？
You sleepy?

360
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,364
是的，我真的很累。
Yeah, I'm really tired.

361
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:25,741
好好休息。派對明天繼續。
Well, rest up. The party continues tomorrow.

362
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,911
需要什麼嗎？明白了。
You need anything? All right.

363
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:30,538
-蜜蜂？-什麼？
-Bee? -Yeah?

364
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,754
我很高興認識你，而且你對我這麼好！
Thanks for knowing me and treating me like I was okay.

365
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,134
怎麼了？你沒事吧？
You don't think you're okay?

366
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:49,890
我是說..。
I mean...

367
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,645
我想有正常的感覺，但..。
I wanna feel normal, but...

368
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,067
大部分時間我都覺得很奇怪。
I just feel weird most of the time.

369
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,989
嗯，我喜歡奇怪。
Well, I like weird.

370
00:22:06,490 --> 00:22:07,366
一直以來。
All of the time.

371
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,663
想像一下，當你大四的時候，所有的女孩都會愛你。
So, just imagine how all the girls are gonna love you when you're a senior.

372
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,668
明早見。
See you in the morning.

373
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,254
晚安，夥計。
Good night, dude.

374
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,359
在狂歡了嗎？
Ew. Orgy?

375
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:45,822
狂歡？
Orgy?

376
00:23:28,781 --> 00:23:29,782
旋轉它。
Spin it.

377
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,140
哇！
[Allison] Whoo!

378
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,516
是啊！- 我們點燃了。點燃了。
-[Max] Yeah! -[John] We lit. We lit.

379
00:23:56,725 --> 00:23:57,561
相信我。
Truth me.

380
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:02,524
這裏的每個人，你最想和誰上床？
Out of everybody here, who would you want to sleep with the most?

381
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:06,652
-索尼婭.。- 哦，是的。
-Sonya. -[Allison] Ooh, yeah.

382
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,947
百分之百。
Hundred percent.

383
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,199
-來吧.。-山姆，到你了，大個子。
-Come on. -Sam, you're a close second, stud.

384
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,910
該死，-好吧。輪到我了。
-[John] Damn. -Okay. My turn.

385
00:24:15,953 --> 00:24:18,206
各位。- 對這個壞女孩。
-[Allison] Yo, people. -[John] To this bad girl.

386
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,083
蜜蜂，真心話還是大冒險。
Bee, truth or dare.

387
00:24:22,042 --> 00:24:23,170
大冒險。
Dare.

388
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,673
-我要你吻了這裏的每個人。
-I dare you to kiss everyone here. -[Allison chuckles]

389
00:24:27,756 --> 00:24:29,968
-是的。- 哦，是的。
-Yes. -[Allison] Ooh, yeah.

390
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,927
她有那個膽量。- 我需要看。
-[John] She got balls. -[Sonya] I need to watch.

391
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,515
好吧。
All right.

392
00:24:35,598 --> 00:24:38,310
-這就是我在說的。- 我為此感到興奮。
-That's what I'm talking about. -[Sonya] I'm excited for that.

393
00:24:38,392 --> 00:24:40,103
那就是我要找的全部。- 等一下。
-[Max] That's all I'm looking for. -[Allison] Hold on.

394
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,020
我們來吧。
[John] Let's go.

395
00:24:42,271 --> 00:24:43,105
我準備好了。
I'm ready.

[in deep voice] I know it was you, Fredo. I know it was you.

398
00:24:52,072 --> 00:24:54,034
-謝謝.。-那是指環王嗎？
-Thank you. -Is that Lord of the Rings?

我愛她。

[pants] Wait, just give me--

416
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,814
給我一分鐘，讓我塗一個唇膏先。
Give me a second to process that shit.

417
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:09,609
- 你是由瑞克·詹姆斯撫養長大的？-我想要從來一次。
-[John] You raised by Rick James? -I'm thinking a redo.

418
00:26:09,692 --> 00:26:11,151
-太棒了。
-That's amazing. -[laughing]

419
00:26:11,235 --> 00:26:14,531
一定要跟你吻好久，因為我是黑人。看到了嗎？
Make sure it's real nice and long for you, because I'm black. See that?

420
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,864
就這樣。嗯。
There you go. Mm.

421
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,244
-該死，是的。
-[Bee giggles] -Fuck, yeah.

422
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,494
來吧(趕快)。
Come on.

423
00:26:22,037 --> 00:26:24,207
-哇！- 是啊！
-Whoo! -[Sonya] Yeah!

424
00:26:25,666 --> 00:26:26,709
哦，蜜蜂！
[John] Oh, Bee!

425
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,421
蜜蜂，怎麼回事？
Bee, what the hell?

426
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,381
我給你塗了這麼浪漫的唇膏，你要舔我的臉嗎？
You give her that romantic shit, and you're gonna lick my face?

427
00:26:33,465 --> 00:26:34,968
該死，這就是我的全部要求。
Damn, that's all I'm asking.

428
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,760
- 好的。- 他媽的。
-[Bee] All right. -[John] Freaky shit.

429
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:40,807
聞起來不錯。唾沫很好。今早刷牙了。
Smell good. The spit is nice. Brushed your teeth this morning.

430
00:26:42,641 --> 00:26:43,642
好的。
[Max laughing] Okay.

431
00:26:47,187 --> 00:26:48,230
真奇怪。- 你好。
-[John] Weird. -[Bee] Hi.

432
00:26:48,314 --> 00:26:50,775
是啊！
-[John howling] -[Allison laughing] Yeah!

433
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,485
到薩米了。
[Max cat-calling] Sammy's turn.

434
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,281
薩米。
-[John laughing] -[Max chanting] Sammy.

435
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,574
- 她太性感了。- 好的。
-[Allison] She's so hot. -[John] Okay.

436
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,619
[好了，山姆，你來吧。
[Max] Come on, Sam. You got this.

437
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,245
和她親熱。
Make out with her.

438
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,456
對不起。
[Sam] I'm sorry.

439
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:09,501
這有點奇怪。我甚至都不認識你們。
This is kind of weird. I don't even really know you guys.

440
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,046
來吧，山姆，嚇到你了，好嗎？
[Max] Come on, Sam. Freak you out, there, stud?

441
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:14,923
-山姆，別傻了。- 我甚至不認識你們。
-Sam, don't be a puss. -[Sam] I don't even know you guys.

442
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,301
我不是。-我-我只是-。
[Sam] I'm not. I'm-- I just--

443
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,053
-你在盯著我看。- 噢，我們沒有在看。
-You're staring at me. -[Max] Oh, we're not looking.

444
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:20,347
嘿，這不奇怪。
[Allison] Hey, it's not weird.

445
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,931
- 嘿 是啊。
-[Bee] Hey. -[John] Yeah.

446
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,265
閉上眼睛。
Just close your eyes.

447
00:27:23,682 --> 00:27:24,725
好吧。
Okay?

448
00:27:24,808 --> 00:27:26,311
假裝他們根本不在這裏。
Pretend they're not even here.

449
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,062
你能做到的。
You can do this.

450
00:27:28,729 --> 00:27:29,772
你來處理。
You got this.

451
00:27:35,527 --> 00:27:39,031
僅僅因為我閉上眼睛並不意味著他們不在這裏。
Just because I close my eyes doesn't mean that they're not here.

452
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,285
你相信我媽？
Do you trust me?

453
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:44,787
對。
Yes.

454
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,038
放鬆點。
Just relax.

455
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,250
這不奇怪，好嗎？我們只是玩得開心。
It's not weird, okay? We're just having fun.

456
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,671
他走了。
There he goes.

457
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,496
噓。
Shh.

458
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,292
要知道。你在幫助我們實現一個偉大的目標。
You're helping fulfill a great purpose. Know this.

459
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,880
我不要做偉大的海豚
I don't wanna fulfill a great porpoise.

460
00:28:35,963 --> 00:28:38,258
他剛才說的是“海豚”嗎？
[grunts] Did he just say "porpoise"?

461
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,592
喲，我想是他說的。
Yo, I think he did.

462
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,760
他甚至都不知道怎麼一回事
He didn't even get a chance to understand.

463
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,557
準備好了。
Ready?

464
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:47,474
準備好了。-是的.。
-[Sonya] Ready. -Yep.

465
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,687
哦，好吧。
-[John grunts] Oh, okay. -[exhales]

466
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:53,355
臥槽，這東西漏了。
[John] That shit leaking.

467
00:28:58,235 --> 00:29:01,406
等等，等等。我覺得不起作用了。我覺得它沒血了。
Wait, hold on. My shit ain't working. I think it ran out of blood.

468
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,159
-哦，該死！-哦，該死的。
-Oh, shit! -Oh, shit.

469
00:29:04,241 --> 00:29:06,953
噢，該死！
[John yells] Oh, shit!

470
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,913
所有的血都在他骨瘦如柴的人身上。
[Max] All that blood was just in his boner.

471
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,916
麥克斯，別笑，好嗎？約翰，放鬆。這血在為你服務。
Max, don't laugh, okay? John, relax. This blood is serving you.

472
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,587
我並沒有報名參加這個活動，幹嘛來為我服務。
I did not sign up for this shit to serve me in my mouth.

473
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,213
臥槽，這血還是熱的。我覺得他發燒了。
This shit's still warm. I think he got a fever.

474
00:29:18,297 --> 00:29:21,718
你知道你報名到底為什麼的，想去唱片店嗎？約翰？
You know what you signed up for. You want to go platinum, John?

475
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,428
當你和魔鬼做交易時，事情會變得混亂。
Things can get messy when you make a deal with the devil.

476
00:29:24,511 --> 00:29:25,555
現在把血收集起來。
Now collect it.

477
00:29:25,637 --> 00:29:26,890
- 像這樣？- 給你。
-[John] Like this? -[Bee] There you go.

478
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,435
這要花多長時間？我只想讓我的願望快點變成現實。
[Allison] How long is this gonna take? I just want my shit to come true.

479
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,645
愛麗森，你們都會得到你們想要的。
[Bee] Allison, you'll all get what you want.

480
00:29:38,984 --> 00:29:40,402
好的，我們開始吧。
Okay, let's go.

481
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,073
我認為這不好笑。看看我的衣服。
[John] I don't think this is funny. Look at my outfit.

482
00:29:45,157 --> 00:29:47,911
我剛買到的這衣服，你知道嗎？七折買回來的。
I just got this shit, you feel me? Thirty percent off.

483
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,662
梅西的衣服。我不玩遊戲。
Macy's. Top rack. I don't play games.

484
00:29:50,746 --> 00:29:52,415
你長得像嘉莉。
You look like Carrie,

485
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,000
-但是黑色的.。-嘉莉會更好的。
-but black. -Carrie would've been better black.

486
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:57,629
她會被軒尼詩所涵蓋的，好嗎？
She would have been covered in Hennessy, all right?

487
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,339
你穿的又是什麼玩意？看起來像大鳥的婊子。
What are you wearing? Looking like Big Bird's side bitch.

488
00:30:00,422 --> 00:30:03,551
我剛從一場比賽中回來，來不及換，當然穿這身運動服了。
I just came from a game. That's why I'm wearing this, obviously.

489
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,010
我不會錯過的。
I was not gonna miss this.

490
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:10,307
看看這些鬼東西，怪不得病毒很難傳播。
Look at this shit. That would go viral so hard.

491
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:12,185
我是說，沒有人用人來祭祀的。
I mean, nobody's done human sacrifice.

492
00:30:12,267 --> 00:30:14,229
人們總是做出人類的犧牲。
People have always done human sacrifice.

493
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,233
是的，但是，就像...不是在美國和熱帶的人在一起。
Yeah, but, like... not in America with hot people.

494
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,609
索尼婭，把箱子拿來。
Sonya, get the cases.

495
00:30:21,068 --> 00:30:23,613
聽著，當你完蛋了。
Listen, when you're done being totally useless,

496
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,616
趕緊拿塊抹布給我，讓我擦一下眼睛。天啊。
get a rag and wipe Sacrifice Samuel out my damn eye. OMG.

497
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:28,785
嘿。
Hey.

498
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,869
不錯，約翰。
Nice one, John.

499
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,246
噢，我的天。
[gasps] Oh, my God.

500
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:35,124
我身上也已經弄髒了
I've got Sacrifice Samuel all over me.

501
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,292
這盒子裏是什麼？
What's in the box?

502
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:45,968
那麼，蜜蜂，如果你已經知道該怎麼做了，你為什麼還需要這本書？
Yo, so, Bee, why do you need the book if you already know what to do?

503
00:30:46,093 --> 00:30:48,303
這就像耶穌向天堂問路。
It's like Jesus asking directions to heaven.

504
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:49,931
去他媽的上去，你知道嗎？
Just fucking go up, you know?

505
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:54,102
猶太人有卷軸。
Well, the Jews have their scrolls,

506
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,979
基督徒有他們的聖經。
Christians have their Bibles,

507
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,855
魔鬼也有他的詩句。
and the devil has his verses.

508
00:30:58,397 --> 00:31:00,817
別碰它。它非常古老，非常精緻。
Don't touch it. It's very old and very delicate.

509
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,276
這是唯一的一本。
It's the only one.

510
00:31:02,985 --> 00:31:05,613
血流到頁面時，你背誦這首詩。
You recite the verse while the blood hits the page.

511
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,322
沒有它，這一切都不會實現
Without it, none of this happens.

512
00:31:09,324 --> 00:31:13,245
在我們上樓去幹掉那小孩，取無辜的血之前，讓我們開始吧。
Let's get started before we head upstairs and get the blood of the innocent.

513
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,427
911，你有什麼緊急情況？
[woman] 911, what's your emergency?

514
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,470
我叫科爾·詹森。一個人在我的客廳被殺了。
My name is Cole Johnson. A guy was murdered in my living room.

515
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,432
地址是呃..。大比道2455號。
The address is, uh... 2455 Bigby Drive.

516
00:31:33,515 --> 00:31:36,936
-你能派人來嗎？-殺人者還在房子裏嗎？
-Can you please send someone? - Are the attackers still in the house?

517
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,604
他們在樓下玩爆了。
They're downstairs having a blast.

518
00:31:38,687 --> 00:31:40,647
-有多少人，科爾？-太多了.。
- How many are there, Cole? -Too many.

519
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,401
你能把我媽媽找來嗎？她在城裏的凱悅酒店。
Can you please get my mom? She's at the Hyatt in the city.

520
00:31:44,568 --> 00:31:45,527
大酒店
Living large.

521
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,156
當然，科爾，現在聽我說。重要的是你要躲起來。
Of course, Cole. Now listen to me. It's important that you stay hidden.

522
00:31:50,324 --> 00:31:53,453
-我要保護自己.。謝謝。-別這樣做。不，不，不-。
-I gotta protect myself. Thanks. -Do not do that. No, no, no--

523
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,650
-好吧.。
-Okay. -[chattering]

524
00:32:36,828 --> 00:32:39,540
...我們的死亡細胞約有15%脫落。
[Bee] ...we shed about 15 percent of our dead cells.

525
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,583
哇！
[John] Whoo!

526
00:32:42,084 --> 00:32:44,170
喲，這孩子的嗜好，就是喜歡被別人欺負。
Yo, this kid's hobby must be getting bullied.

527
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,381
他在讀“秘密”這本書？
He's reading The Secret?

528
00:32:47,464 --> 00:32:50,051
他十歲了。他需要知道什麼秘密？
He's ten years old. What secret he need to know?

529
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,593
他不會聽見我們說話嗎？
Won't he hear us?

530
00:32:52,094 --> 00:32:54,973
媽的，當然不會，我給他喝了酒還下了藥。
With the amount of drugs I gave him? Hell, no.

531
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,686
- 好孩子。帥哥。-你有針嗎？
-[Sonya] Good boy. Pretty boy. -Do you have the needle?

532
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,188
當然，我有針。
Of course, I have the needle.

533
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,197
有一種更快的方法來獲取所有的血。
You know, there is a faster way to get all that blood.

534
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:14,032
如果把他殺了會發生什麼事情？
[Bee] What happens when you kill someone?

535
00:33:14,116 --> 00:33:16,369
他們失去了所有的Instagram粉絲。
[John] They lose, like, all they Instagram followers.

536
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,496
-天啊，那太糟糕了。-不，如果他們死了。
-[gasps] Oh, my God, that would suck. -No, they die.

537
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,833
我就得再找一個無辜的孩子。
And then I'd have to find another innocent kid.

538
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,628
而我們必須找到所有奇怪的血液混合在一起才能夠奏效。
And all of this only works if we get that top-shelf pure shit.

539
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,339
科爾基的血本上是我們的水龍頭，源源不斷。
And Cole is basically a faucet of that for us.

540
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,187
在這之後，我們完成儀式..。
[Bee] After this, we finish the ritual...

541
00:33:44,271 --> 00:33:45,732
而你的願望實現了。
and your wish comes true.

542
00:33:49,192 --> 00:33:50,819
-該死，我錯過了靜脈。- 嗯。
-Damn, I missed the vein. -[Sonya] Mm.

543
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,449
勇敢點兒。
[Bee] Premium real estate. Go for it.

544
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:10,715
等等，你得給他幫個忙.。
Wait, you gotta give him a Band-Aid.

545
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,467
好的，我們去把血液混合吧。
Okay. Let's go mix some blood.

546
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,760
約翰，胡說。
John, alley-oop.

547
00:34:14,843 --> 00:34:15,927
勒布朗·詹姆斯。
[John] LeBron James.

548
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:19,974
真是好孩子。
Good boy.

549
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:50,105
他為什麼光著身子？
Why is he shirtless?

550
00:35:51,439 --> 00:35:55,027
-這是你的第一個問題？-你怎麼能問這個？看看他。
-That's your first question? -How can you ask that? Just look at him.

551
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,195
我還是不明白。
I still don't get it.

552
00:36:01,616 --> 00:36:02,868
給他一塊餅乾。
Give him a cookie.

553
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,957
-不用了，謝謝。-吃餅乾。
-No, thanks. -Eat the cookie.

554
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,126
我只是不太喜歡餅乾，好嗎？蜜蜂知道。
I just don't really like cookies, okay? Bee knows that.

555
00:36:13,461 --> 00:36:15,590
如果你吃東西，你會感覺好些的。暈過去了。
You'll feel better if you eat. You fainted.

556
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,591
不，我沒有。
No, I didn't.

557
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,508
是的，你有。
Yes, you did.

558
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,843
在我取了你的血之後。
After I took your blood,

559
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,304
我在房間裏等著，因為感覺到不對
I waited in the room, because something felt off.

560
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:25,224
所以我蹲在門後。幾秒鐘後，你起床了。
I crouched behind the door. A few seconds later, you got up,

561
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,935
把床單綁在床上，把床單扔出窗外。
tied a sheet to your bed, threw the sheet out the window.

562
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,354
然後你暈倒了。所以，你知道..。
And then you fainted. So, you know...

563
00:36:30,437 --> 00:36:32,355
你的血糖很低。吃餅乾。
Your blood sugar is low. Eat the cookie.

564
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,322
你生我氣了嗎？
Are you mad at me?

565
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,489
吃餅乾。
Cookie.

566
00:36:43,074 --> 00:36:45,410
一定會很好吃的。
This is gonna be so good.

567
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:47,914
搞什麼..。
What the...

568
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,082
哦，給你。
Oh, there you go.

569
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,000
就這樣。
There you go.

570
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,422
一個好孩子。
That's a good boy.

571
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:07,266
-你為什麼醒著，科爾？-因為我睡不著。
-Why are you awake, Cole? -Because I couldn't sleep.

572
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,227
-我不相信你。- 好的，好的。I-。
-I don't believe you. -[Cole] Okay, fine. I--

573
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,895
我要去樹林裏抽煙。
I was gonna go smoke in the woods.

574
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,687
你本來要在樹林裏抽煙的。
[Bee] You were gonna go smoke in the woods.

575
00:37:13,855 --> 00:37:17,068
是的，你知道，就像...大麻。
Yeah. You know, like... marijuana.

576
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,737
你不打算和拿出來分享嗎？來吧，夥計。
You weren't gonna share with your boy? Come on, man.

577
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,489
聽我的混音磁帶，我們本來可以興奮到很嗨的！
We could've got high, listen to my mix tape. My shit's fire.

578
00:37:22,572 --> 00:37:24,950
-我要抽大麻.。-你為什麼沒喝我給你的酒？
-I wanna smoke pot. -Why didn't you drink the shot?

579
00:37:25,033 --> 00:37:27,370
他為什麼光著身子？你為什麼要取我的血？
Why is he shirtless? Why did you take my blood?

580
00:37:27,452 --> 00:37:29,997
科爾-好吧，因為我不喜歡喝酒。
-Cole. -Okay. Fine. Because I don't like alcohol.

581
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,708
因為我想讓你覺得我很酷。
I just drank it because I wanted you to think I was cool.

582
00:37:35,835 --> 00:37:37,754
你為什麼要給一個12歲的孩子喝酒？
Why did you give a 12-year-old alcohol?

583
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:40,508
因為我在酒裏放了迷藥，可以讓你睡上八個小時以上。
'Cause I put shit in that alcohol that makes them conk out

584
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,759
八個小時以上。
for eight hours or more.

585
00:37:43,385 --> 00:37:44,511
你還看到了什麼？
What else did you see?

586
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:47,389
我剛見到你。
I just see you.

587
00:37:48,181 --> 00:37:51,143
還有這些不認識的混蛋，在我家。
And these assholes, who I don't know, in my house.

588
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,357
-為什麼他的襯衫上沾滿了血？-沒人會讓我借襯衫給他了。
-Why is his shirt covered in blood? -No one would let me borrow a shirt.

589
00:37:58,316 --> 00:38:00,361
-那甚至不是答案。-天哪.。
-That's not even an answer. -Oh, my God.

590
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,947
難道他沒有看到他身後的鏡子嗎？我們可以看到你在割斷繩子。
Does he not see the mirror behind him? We can see you cutting the rope.

591
00:38:05,699 --> 00:38:06,783
他現在知道了。
Well, he does now.

592
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:11,205
太可愛了，你還在割斷繩子。
Aw, it's so cute, you're still cutting the rope.

593
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,833
看看你。你真的在努力，不是嗎？
Look at you. You're really trying there, aren't you?

594
00:38:15,125 --> 00:38:17,711
-你為什麼要割斷繩索？-我不喜歡被綁起來。
-Why are you cutting ropes? -I don't like being tied up.

595
00:38:17,794 --> 00:38:19,672
-你為什麼帶刀？-這是禮物.。
-Why do you have a knife? -It was a gift.

596
00:38:19,754 --> 00:38:20,631
天哪。
Oh, my God.

597
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,633
他還在割斷繩索。
He's still cutting the ropes.

598
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,135
好堅決的小混蛋，不是嗎？
Determined little fucker, aren't you?

599
00:38:26,636 --> 00:38:29,139
聽著，我不會告訴任何人。
Look, I won't tell anyone.

600
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:31,684
好吧。你瞭解我。我很保守秘密的。
Okay? You know me. I'm good with secrets.

601
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,437
我不會告訴我父母你在狂歡
I won't tell my parents that you were having an orgy

602
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,854
需要我的血來做。
and needed my blood to do it.

603
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,488
你知道什麼是狂歡嗎？
Do you even know what an orgy is?

604
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,073
我猜這是可悲之人做的可悲之事。
I'm guessing it's something sad people do

605
00:38:47,157 --> 00:38:49,534
因為他們想讓其他可悲的人喜歡他們。
'cause they want other sad people to like them,

606
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:53,039
他們在一起的時候，可以忘記這些可悲的事情，哪怕是一分鐘。
and they can forget for one minute how sad they are in general.

607
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,000
事實上，這是一個相當好的答案。
That's actually a pretty good answer.

608
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,793
是為了一個科學專案好嗎？
It was for a science project, okay?

609
00:38:59,544 --> 00:39:00,378
狂歡？
The orgy?

610
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,381
不是，是因為血。
No. The blood.

611
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,717
狂歡是一群人在一起做愛的時候。
Orgy is when a bunch of people have sex together.

612
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,052
我們不需要你的血。
We wouldn't need your blood for that.

613
00:39:09,054 --> 00:39:10,722
你本可以直接問的。
You could've just asked.

614
00:39:11,306 --> 00:39:13,768
我會為了你，為了科學而獻血的。
I would've let you have some blood for science.

615
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,644
我知道你害怕針頭。
I knew you were afraid of needles.

616
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,687
這顯然是個誤會。
This was clearly a misunderstanding.

617
00:39:17,771 --> 00:39:18,938
索尼婭解開他。
Sonya, untie him.

618
00:39:19,939 --> 00:39:21,983
對不起，我們嚇到你了，科爾，沒事吧？
I'm sorry we scared you, Cole. We good?

619
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,905
- 噢，該死。
-[John] Oh, shit. -[screaming]

620
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,740
- 閉嘴！-媽的！
-[Max] Shut up! -Holy fuck!

621
00:39:28,823 --> 00:39:30,867
-不好.。-該死的員警。
-Not good. -Fucking police.

622
00:39:31,451 --> 00:39:33,204
員警為什麼在外面，科爾？
Why are the cops outside, Cole?

623
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,206
-我不知道。-你給他們打電話了嗎？
-I don't know. -Did you call them?

624
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,000
-不是。你說你在房間裏。-讓我覺得你看到了什麼。
-No. You said you were in the room. -Makes me think you saw something

625
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,460
嚇得你要報警。科爾？
that scared you enough to call the cops. Right, Cole?

626
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:43,839
-噢，操！
-[knock on door] -Oh, fuck!

627
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,007
回答我，科爾。
Answer me, Cole.

628
00:39:48,843 --> 00:39:50,095
噢。
[grunts] Ow.

629
00:39:51,096 --> 00:39:52,722
-哦，該死！- 各位，別動！
-Oh, shit! -[officer] Everybody, freeze!

630
00:39:52,806 --> 00:39:55,351
舉起手來，馬上！舉起手來！馬上！
[officer 2] Hands up, now! Put your hands up! Now!

631
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,477
-馬上！- 我們開始行動。
-Now! -[Max] Here we go.

632
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,937
舉起手來！- 哦！
-[officer] Hands up! -[John] Oh!

633
00:39:59,896 --> 00:40:01,689
該死！
-[chuckles] -[officer] Shit!

634

Hands up. Don't shoot, man. Black lives matter, too. You feel me?

635

拿槍的，你給我冷靜點！
[John] Chill with the gun stuff.

642

不，科爾，我只是...。
No, Cole. I'm just trying--

657
00:41:02,917 --> 00:41:06,589
在大比大道的187呼叫的情況如何？
[man on radio] What's the status of that 187 call on Bigby Drive?

658
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,426
聽著，夥計。
[John] Look, man.

659

我不能進監獄。你們都殺了員警。
I can't go to jail. Y'all killed the cops, man.

660
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:14,554
我沒有參與這件事。
I ain't involved with this shit.

661
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:16,097
沒事的。麥克斯，拿起來。

這是統計數字。

據說你要麼進了監獄要麼死了。
They say you either end up in jail or dead.

664
00:41:22,145 --> 00:41:24,063
都是為了我，比。
It's gonna be both for me, Bee.

665
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,858
-“完全清除”的暗碼應該怎麼說？- 你的狀況如何？
-What's the code for "all clear"? -[man] What's your status?

666
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,986
說“安全”就行了。
Just say "all clear."

667
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,529
他為什麼要知道員警的暗碼？
[Sonya] Why would he know cop codes?

668
00:41:32,197 --> 00:41:34,115
別尖叫了，你要表現得像個成年人。

暗碼是什麼？我知道你知道的。

-[man] Bynak, you there? -Wait.

674
00:41:47,545 --> 00:41:50,007
你難道不明白。你在撒謊的時候，你會把目光移開。
[Bee] You don't get it. You look away when you lie.

675
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,135
你看著我的眼睛，告訴我真的暗碼。

是10-4。很明顯。

說我們休息一下-
-[Cole] Say we're taking a break to-- -[Bee] Cole.

680
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,445
拜納克警官你需要支援嗎？
[man] Officer Bynak, you need backup?

681
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,072
暗碼七。

天哪。
Oh, my God!

689
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,939
他媽的趕緊過來幫我。你幹嗎呢?
Fucking help me. What are you doing?

690
00:42:48,231 --> 00:42:50,483
天啊，他朝我胸部開槍了。
Oh, my God. He shot me in the boob.

691
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,362
什麼樣的老二會朝一個女孩的胸部開槍？
What kind of dick shoots a girl in the boob?

692
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,199
-我沒有報名參加這個活動.。-別抱怨了.。別再抱怨了。
-I did not sign up for this shit. -Stop complaining. Stop all your whining.

它們還沒有發育完全呢，這回要停止繼續生長了。
They're totally gonna stop growing. They weren't even done.

694
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,122
有時候你必須冷靜下來好嗎？
Sometimes you gotta settle, all right?

695
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,499
我有個表妹，錢特爾，奶子平了。
I got a cousin Chantelle, titties flat.

696
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,916

697
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,459
哦，我的天。
Ow. Oh, my God.

698
00:43:08,543 --> 00:43:10,461
-噢！該死的賤人。
-Ow! You fucking bitch. -[Sonya laughs]

699
00:43:10,545 --> 00:43:11,714
你怎麼啦?
What's wrong with you?

怎麼啦? 不。
What? No.

702
00:43:18,094 --> 00:43:20,179
什麼意思，我要一直流血嗎？
What do you mean, I'm gonna bleed?

703
00:43:20,263 --> 00:43:22,433
我們能不能把衛生棉什麼的塞進去？
Can we just stick a tampon in it or something?

704
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,978
天啊，我們得叫救護車了，夥計們。
Oh, my God. We need to call an ambulance, guys.

705
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,813
我要輛救護車。我不想失去我的胸部。
I need an ambulance. I don't wanna lose my boob.

706
00:43:28,896 --> 00:43:29,939
我不能那樣做。
I can't do that.

707
00:43:30,023 --> 00:43:30,857
什麼？
[Allison] What?

708
00:43:31,691 --> 00:43:32,650
為什麼不行?。
Why not?

709
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,070
因為你的胸部是被一個現在已經死了的員警擊中的。
Because your boob was shot by a now-dead cop.

710
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,322
你怎麼跟人解釋這一點？
Have fun explaining that.

711
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,781
沒有人會喜歡沒有胸的女人的，蜜蜂。
No dude's gonna motorboat these, Bee.

712
00:43:40,575 --> 00:43:43,037
你喜歡嗎？你想要它們晃的快一些，還是想要它們大一些？
How you like it? You want them quick or you want them long?

713
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,040
你想吐點唾沫在它們上面？
[continues mimicking motorboat] You want a little spit on them?

714
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,042
科爾！

[Sonya] I'm coming.

767
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,927
科爾你好。
Hi, Cole.

768
00:50:15,845 --> 00:50:17,179
啊呀，天啊，真糟。
Oh, God.

769
00:50:17,263 --> 00:50:20,767
你覺得你父母要花多長時間？
How long do you think it'll take your parents

770
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,895
找到你的屍體？
to find your body down here? [chuckles]

771
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,354
明天？
Tomorrow?

772
00:50:26,856 --> 00:50:28,149
兩天后？
Two days from now?

773
00:50:28,774 --> 00:50:29,900
以後呢？
Even later?

774
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:34,281
可能當你的身體開始散發出乳酪的臭味。
Probably when your body starts to reek like cheese.

775
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:38,075
或者我們可以把你的身體燒了，科爾。
[laughs] Or we could just burn your body, Cole.

776
00:50:38,451 --> 00:50:40,287
會很漂亮的。
It would be so beautiful.

777
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,458
哦，你打偏了。
[laughs] Oh, you missed.

778
00:50:47,001 --> 00:50:48,043
我的指甲！
My nails!

779
00:50:48,753 --> 00:50:53,425
科爾！科爾！
Cole! Cole! [grunts]

780
00:50:57,344 --> 00:51:01,056
科爾，我要在你死之前折磨你
I'm gonna make sure you hurt before you die, Cole.

781
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,313
切斷你的手指。每一根
Cut your fingers off. Every single one.

782
00:51:07,396 --> 00:51:08,773
過來，科爾！
Come here, Cole!

783
00:51:08,856 --> 00:51:11,860
我要把你作為這些蜈蚣蜘蛛大餐。嗯。
I'm making a human self-centipede. Yeah!

784
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,240
人類蜘蛛蜈蚣大餐，孩子！
Human self-centipede, child!

785
00:51:18,324 --> 00:51:20,576
會很好吃的，科爾！
Gonna taste so good, Cole!

786
00:51:20,659 --> 00:51:23,163
科爾，你的嘴會被縫在屁股上的！
Your mouth is gonna get sewn to your ass, Cole!

787
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,040
你的臭屁股！
Your mouthy ass!

788
00:51:40,554 --> 00:51:42,139
-我還活著，媽的-。
I'm still alive motherfuck--

789
00:52:03,577 --> 00:52:05,121
你剛才炸了索尼婭嗎？
Did you just blow up Sonya?

790
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,332
沒有。
No.

791
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,085
我的意思是，我甚至沒有生氣。我有點驚訝。
I mean, I'm not even mad. I'm a little surprised.

792
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,586
怎麼回事？
What did that?

793
00:52:13,587 --> 00:52:14,548
一個煙火。
A firework.

794
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,465
一個煙火？
A firework?

795
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,800
天啊。
Holy shit.

796
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,968
該死，你很厲害，孩子。
Damn, good for you, kid.

797
00:52:19,677 --> 00:52:20,970
太棒了。
That is awesome.

798
00:52:21,303 --> 00:52:23,305
所以，現在可以開始了嗎？
So, you want a head start?

799
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,269
-拜託，你是四分衛。-生活是不公平的，夥計。
-Come on, you're the quarterback. -Life's not fair, dude.

800
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,436
你們真不要臉。
You guys suck.

801
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,645
你剛剛炸了索尼婭。
You just blew up Sonya.

802
00:52:33,065 --> 00:52:34,316
科爾，你不能超過我。
You can't outrun me, Cole.

803
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,364
等到他們快抓到你了，像一袋石頭一樣倒下去。
Wait until they've almost got you, drop like a bag of rocks.

804
00:52:43,409 --> 00:52:44,660
踢他的雞巴。
[Bee] Kick him in the dick.

805
00:52:44,743 --> 00:52:45,579
踢他。

806
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:56,464
哇！
Whoo!

807
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,427
你竟然踢我的老二。
You missed my dick.

808
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,970
-不，我沒有。-很確定你做了.。
-No, I didn't. -Pretty sure you did.

809
00:53:03,053 --> 00:53:04,179
還有個大雞巴。
And I got a big dick.

810
00:53:04,972 --> 00:53:05,806
不，你沒有。
No, you don't.

811
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,017
這太傷人了。
That's just hurtful.

812
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,895
拜託，別...別...。
Please, don't-- Don't--

813
00:53:15,065 --> 00:53:16,191
沒有抱怨。
[Max] No whining.

814
00:53:16,275 --> 00:53:17,152
保留一些尊嚴。
Save some dignity.

815
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,406
【雞蛋打破的聲音】。
[egg breaking]

816
00:53:23,657 --> 00:53:26,243
-那是什麼鬼聲音？-
-What the hell is that? -[gasping]

817
00:53:26,327 --> 00:53:27,787
-嗯？-是傑瑞米。

-什麼？-雞蛋。
-What? -Eggs.

819
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,125
雞蛋。
Eggs.

820
00:53:32,666 --> 00:53:33,500
雞蛋？
Eggs?

821
00:53:33,959 --> 00:53:36,128
你一定在騙我。
You gotta be shitting me.

822
00:53:36,712 --> 00:53:38,590
有人在砸你的房子？
Somebody's egging your house?

823
00:53:46,597 --> 00:53:47,474
這孩子是誰？
[Max] Who is this kid?

824
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,476
一個混蛋而已。
Just an asshole.

825
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,269
-他經常用雞蛋砸你的房子？-有時候.。
-He egg your house a lot? -Sometimes.

826
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,355
- 那麼，你打算怎麼做呢？-什麼？
-[Max] So, what are you gonna do about it? -What?

827
00:53:54,438 --> 00:53:57,566
我說，你要讓那個小流氓到你的房子裏來撒野嗎？
I said, are you gonna let that little punk come on to your property？

828
00:53:57,650 --> 00:54:00,070
不尊重你的家庭財產，不尊重你？
your family's property and disrespect you like that?

829
00:54:04,990 --> 00:54:09,037
不，該死，不，這是美國。你得去教訓他。
No. Hell, no. This is America. You need to wreck his ass.

830
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,832
你在開我的玩笑嗎？
Are you kidding me?

831
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,000
出去把那個賤人打一頓。
Get out there and crush that bitch.

837
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,685
你想怎樣？
You wanna do something?

838
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,062
知道我要幹什麼嗎？
You know what I'm gonna do?

839
00:54:35,145 --> 00:54:36,188
你想幹什麼?。
What's that?

840
00:54:38,399 --> 00:54:40,235
我要用這個右腳。
I'm gonna take this right foot,

841
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,114
而我要在你的臉的那一邊打你。
and I'm gonna whop you on that side of your face.

842
00:54:46,907 --> 00:54:49,493
而且你對此也無能為力。
And there's not a damn thing you can do about it.

843
00:54:49,576 --> 00:54:51,496
真的嗎？
[chuckles] Really?

844
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,207
真的。
Really.

845

我要毀了你的屁股。
I'm gonna wreck your ass.

846
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,093
那到底是什麼鬼啊？你他媽的肯定是瘋了。
What the hell was that? You must be crazy.

847
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,637
傑瑞米你得聽我說好嗎。
Jeremy, you have to listen to me, okay?

848
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:11,224
那邊有個人想殺我。
There's a guy over there who's trying to kill me.

849
00:55:11,306 --> 00:55:13,184
我對天發誓-我對天發誓。
-I swear to God. -I swear to God.

850
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,811
-我是認真的.。-我是認真的.。

851
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,645
我家有屍體。
There are dead bodies in my house.

852

-等等，真的嗎？-員警來了.。他們殺了員警。
-Wait, seriously? -The cops came. They killed the cops.

853
00:55:21,358 --> 00:55:24,404
-警車在哪里？-他們瘋了，他們把他們藏起來了。
-Where is the cop car? -They're crazy. They're covering it up.

854
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,906
好吧。如果你能幫我，我就戴上藍色的頭巾。
Okay? If you get me out of this, I'll wear a blue headband.

855
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:30,993
我給你做足部按摩。到大學為止，我會做你的家庭作業。
I'll give you foot massages. I'll do your homework until college.

-真的嗎？-是的.。
-Really? -Yeah.

859
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,792
如果你死了我還能夠找誰欺負？
I mean, if you die, who am I gonna pick on?

860
00:55:40,169 --> 00:55:41,003
一點兒沒錯。
Exactly.

861
00:55:41,462 --> 00:55:43,298
好的，這是計畫。
Okay, so, here's the plan.

862
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,967
我數到三，我們就趕緊跑，跑到我的自行車那裏。
On three, we're gonna make a run for my bike.

863
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,761
-你坐後座。明白了。-謝謝.。
-You're gonna ride in the back. All right? -Thank you.

一，二-。
One, two--

你說的太多了。
You talk too much.

869
00:56:10,032 --> 00:56:11,617
下次直接打他的臉。
Crack him in the face next time.

870
00:56:13,202 --> 00:56:15,205
不過還不錯。至少你是為自己站出來的。
Not bad. At least you stood up for yourself.

871
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,208
你現在就放我走？
You gonna let me go now?

872
00:56:21,835 --> 00:56:22,669
不。
No.

873
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,550
但如果你殺了我，你就得不到你想要的。
But if you kill me, you won't get what you want.

874
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,510
不，我和其他人不一樣。
No, I'm not like the others.

875
00:56:29,593 --> 00:56:31,261
我是來殺人的。
I came here to kill people.

876
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,643
對。科爾，這就是我要說的！

被困在樹上。
Stuck in the tree.

894
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,947
不能下去！
No way down!

你是個壞孩子。
[in normal voice] You're a badass kid.

900
00:58:13,697 --> 00:58:14,656
放鬆，麥克斯。
Relax, Max.

901
00:58:17,993 --> 00:58:19,496
你不必這樣做。
You don't have to do this.

902
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,165
嗯，我一定要這麼做。
Well, I kind of have to do this.

903

別擔心。我不會讓你死的時候臉上還帶著雞蛋。

-The cheerleader got shot. It's just Bee. -What is going on?

913
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,147

Bee murdered the geek. Stole my blood. Tied me up. Killed the cops.

914

是的，蜜蜂很壞。

-But his car's here. -She picked him up. He's really desperate.

919

難道只有我還有保姆嗎？
Am I the only one that still has a babysitter?

920
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,375
嗯。
Yeah.

921
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:50,419
-那我們怎麼辦？-求你了。
-So, what do we do? -Pray.

922
00:59:51,378 --> 00:59:53,506
-好的.。-我開玩笑的.。
-Okay. -I was kidding.

923
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,883
-哦.。-不過這可能是個好主意.。
-Oh. -But it's probably a great idea, though.

924
01:00:00,470 --> 01:00:01,305
快。
Come on.

925
01:00:09,730 --> 01:00:12,065
-你覺得她能進來嗎？-如果鎖上了就不行。
-You think she can get in here? -Not if it's locked.

926
01:00:12,608 --> 01:00:14,569
你的門是自動鎖的，對吧？
[Cole] Your door automatically locks, right?

927
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,239
不。
[Melanie] Nope.

928
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,989
-我不該讓你捲入這件事。-你被槍擊了。
-I shouldn't have gotten you into this. -You were being shot at.

929
01:02:24,072 --> 01:02:25,907
就是因為我被槍擊了。
Especially because I was being shot at.

930
01:02:25,991 --> 01:02:28,827
很抱歉，你是我最好的朋友。這事我會處理好的。
You're my best friend, I'm sorry. I'm gonna take care of this.

-Do you have your phone? -Yeah.

-叫員警。告訴他們是10-53。-你為什麼知道員警的暗碼？
-Call the cops. Tell them it's a 10-53. -Why do you know cop codes?

933
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:37,461
因為我長大後就想當員警了。
Because I used to wanna be a cop when I grew up.

934
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,715
你從沒有告訴過我。
You never told me that.

不，你知道嗎？那是你應得的。
No. You know what? You deserved that.

1036
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:09,121
什麼，就因為我12歲，就意味著我會被像欺負，被侮辱。
What, just because I'm 12 means I get to be treated like total shit

1037
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,874
和其他人一樣？
by you and Jeremy and everyone else?

1038
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,834
你猜怎麼著?你是廣告狂人的唐.德雷珀。
You know what? You're Don Draper from Mad Men.

1039
01:10:15,084 --> 01:10:17,962
他是多麼酷，多麼英俊，每個人都愛他，
How he's all cool and handsome and everybody loves him,

1040
01:10:18,046 --> 01:10:21,007
然後他回家，你發現他一直都有妻子。
then he goes home and you find out he has a wife the whole time.

1041
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:24,637
-他真是個混蛋！-你是為了我毀了廣告狂人嗎？
-He's such a piece of shit! -Did you just ruin Mad Men for me?

1042
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,514
它甚至不再播放了。你會活下來的。
It's not even on anymore. You'll live.

1043
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,724
還是。
Still.

1044
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,145
-當你離開這裏時會發生什麼？-什麼意思？
-What happens when you leave here? -What do you mean?

1045
01:10:34,229 --> 01:10:35,939
-我要燒掉這個！-好吧。
-I will burn this! -Okay.

1046
01:10:36,147 --> 01:10:38,608
科爾...你想知道什麼？
Cole... what do you want to know?

1047
01:10:41,236 --> 01:10:42,320
血液是幹什麼用的？
What's the blood for?

1048
01:10:42,654 --> 01:10:46,242
你把無辜的血和犧牲的人的血混在一起，
You mix the blood of the innocent with the blood of someone sacrificed,

1049
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,077
然後背誦咒語，
recite the verses,

1050
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,828
把它滴在紙上。
while dripping it on the page.

1051
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,082
基本上，你想要什麼就得到什麼。
And, basically, you get whatever you want.

1052
01:10:56,709 --> 01:11:00,797
過去我很膽小...很害怕。
I used to be so small... and so scared.

1053
01:11:03,424 --> 01:11:06,845
現在我很堅強...而且我有信心..。
Now I'm strong... and I'm confident...

1054
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,224
這就是我所想要的。
and that's all I ever wanted.

1055
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,520
所以，對你來說
And, so, that's all I was to you.

1056
01:11:18,856 --> 01:11:21,567
只是利用我來得到你想要的。
You just used me to get what you wanted.

1057
01:11:22,694 --> 01:11:23,528
不。
No.

1058
01:11:25,238 --> 01:11:26,782
不，科爾，我選了你。
No, Cole. I chose you.

1059
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,286
我是說，我本可以殺了你，而不是愛麗森。
I mean, I could've shot you and not Allison,

1060
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,912
但我沒有。選擇了你。
but I didn't. I chose you.

1061
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,914
因為你是最棒的。
'Cause you're the best.

1062
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,250
對吧？你是我的人。
We click, right? You're my guy.

1063
01:11:40,712 --> 01:11:42,547
我不是第一個孩子，是嗎？
I'm not the first kid, am I?

1064
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:49,972
不。
No.

1065
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,976
然後你就離開這裏，找到另一個水龍頭。
And you'll leave here and just find another faucet.

1066
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:58,479
-你聽到了？-我什麼都聽到了.。這是我的房子。
-You heard that? -I heard everything. This is my house.

1067
01:12:00,315 --> 01:12:01,149
好吧。
Okay.

1068
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:03,276
好的，是的。
Okay, yes.

1069
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:07,698
今晚糟透了但我們可以重新開始。
And tonight sucked, but we can start again.

1070
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,495
那麼你有計劃？
So, you have a plan?

1071
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,206
是的，我們只是說他們襲擊了我們。
Yeah. We just say they attacked us.

1072
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,375
找到他了。
I got him.

1073
01:12:19,334 --> 01:12:20,209
哇！
Whoo!

1074
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:34,308
而且，夥計，我們會很開心的。
Plus, dude, we would have so much fun.

1075
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:37,478
只有你和我對抗整個世界。
Just you and me against the whole world.

1076
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,937
再也不會有人傷害你了。
No one will ever hurt you ever again.

1077
01:12:40,021 --> 01:12:43,274
就沒有什麼好害怕的了。這不是你想要的嗎？
There'll be nothing left to be afraid of. Isn't that what you wanted?

1078
01:12:47,737 --> 01:12:48,905
科爾，你說呢？
What do you say, Cole?

1079
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,037
我猜..。
I guess...

1080
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:01,793
我想我也有個計畫。
I guess I have a plan, too.
