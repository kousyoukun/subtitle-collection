2
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,357
I don't need it. I'm telling you.

3
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:28,028
Just because you don't feel sick now
doesn't mean you don't need the shot.

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,989
I never get sick, okay?
You can take that and give it to Barry.

5
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,826
- His nose is always running.
- What are you giving me shit for?

6
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,788
I saw you earlier today. We said hi.
I said, "Cole." You said, "Mr. Daisy."

7
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:42,041
Why are you giving me shit today?
I mean, it's just a needle, man.

8
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:47,172
Damn. Come here, get the shot.
Ain't nothing to be scared of.

9
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,759
There's 62 kids came here,
got a shot, no problem.

10
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:54,179
You come in here, take ten minutes?
I got 84 kids more to go. Okay?

11
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,223
We're boys. Be cool. Shit, man.
Are you gonna take this shot?

12
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:00,310
Step over here and take the shot,
just like you'd take some ass.

13
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,604
There's nothing to be scared of.

14
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,355
I'm not scared.

15
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,869
Pussy!

16
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:29,839
Did you know only one baby
was born on the Mayflower?

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,050
How crazy is that shit?

18
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,719
His name was literally Oceanus.

19
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,513
He didn't even have a nationality.

20
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,973
Just a citizen of the sea, I guess.

21
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,434
What class did you learn that in?

22
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:45,188
No one learns anything in class.
That's why we have the Internet.

23
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,694
There's my dad.

24
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,613
Melanie, get over here.

25
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,532
It was his high-school dream car.

26
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,536
He got it after the divorce
to make Mom jealous, but...

27
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,205
- it didn't work because it's a car.
- Now.

28
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,209
Dad, can we give Cole a ride home?

29
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:09,754
Cole, are your parents expecting you
to take the bus home?

30
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,549
- I guess so.
- Yeah, they are.

31
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:14,551
So, you should take the bus, okay, sport?

32
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,178
Sorry, dude.
I'll see you, though, neighbor, huh?

33
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,888
- I didn't...
- What's that?

34
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,768
- NASCAR Nation, bitch. Whoo!
- Dad...

35
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,273
Dad!

36
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,499
Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah.

37
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,876
Well, well, well.

38
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,129
Hey, Colonoscopy.
How's it hanging?

39
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,756
I don't know. Okay?

40
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,301
Well, speaking of hanging,
have your balls dropped yet?

41
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,181
I didn't catch that.

42
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:05,685
I said,
"Why are you so interested in my balls?"

43
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,645
Last thing he cares about is your balls.

44
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:10,481
Yeah, 'cause on Saturday,
I hooked up with Shelly MacEntyre.

45
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:11,565
The sophomore?

46
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,111
The sophomore.
But in many ways, she was a senior.

47
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,197
- I don't believe you.
- You don't need to believe him.

48
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,909
It's not like your belief will validate
what happens to his dick.

49
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,035
Wanna know how it was?

50
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,496
No, not really.

51
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,999
Well, see,
as a 14-year-old in that kind of situation

52
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,501
with a 16-year-old
that looks like Shelly MacEntyre,

53
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:32,128
it was overwhelming, man.

54
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,297
I mean, she is a woman.

55
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,967
Fully-developed, man.
It's crazy, man. It's...

56
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,594
Man, you know what I'm saying?

57
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,389
I said, do you know what I'm saying?

58
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:46,726
You just said it didn't matter
if I believed you.

59
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:49,938
- Well, I changed my mind, bitch.
- Sorry, I wasn't...

60
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,859
Oh, my God. He's so weird.

61
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,446
Ooh-whah, ooh-whah. Ooh-whah, ooh-whah.

62
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,529
Hey!

63
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,747
Did you just touch Cole?

64
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:10,541
- So, what if I did?
- Jeremy, check it out.

65
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,628
You so much as think about Cole again...

66
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,048
and I'm gonna...

67
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,803
♪ The girls wanna be her
The boys wanna be her ♪

68
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,345
You crazy bitch.

69
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,225
♪ The girls wanna be her ♪

70
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,185
Now get out of here!

71
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,188
Before I run you over,
you little Pap smear.

72
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,484
- Hey, Coley.
- Hey, Bee.

73
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,070
These are new.

74
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,824
Yeah, I have to wear them sometimes.

75
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,326
They supposedly help strengthen
my left eye,

76
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,621
- but I can't tell the difference.
- You look pretty strong to me.

77
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,872
You skin your palms?

78
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:53,918
- It doesn't hurt.
- Yeah, it does. Come here.

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,512
- They bother you a lot?
- No.

80
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:09,475
You look away when you lie, dude.
They the ones that egg your house?

81
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:15,398
You gotta punch them in the dick.

82
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:18,776
And if they're chasing you,
wait until they've almost got you,

83
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,446
drop like a bag of rocks,
then when they trip over you,

84
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,990
and they're on the ground,
kick them in the dick.

85
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,204
- Hey, so, tell me, how's the folks?
- Better, I think.

86
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,165
Hotel therapy's working?

87
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,042
No, come on, it's great.

88
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:38,046
I mean, they're happy,
we get to hang out, and I get paid.

89
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,340
- I'm like your little Protestant.
- What?

90
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,801
'Cause, like, I have to pay you
to hang out with me.

91
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,095
Are you trying to say "prostitute"?

92
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,513
Oh, my God...

93
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:50,808
No, that would make me the prostitute
and your parents the clients.

94
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,269
That is a terrible analogy.
That is the worst one ever.

95
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,605
- Oh...
- Besides,

96
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,607
I'd wanna hang out with you either way.

97
00:05:58,357 --> 00:05:59,192
Really?

98
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,985
One hundred percent.

99
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,573
I got two years tops before you're
too cool to hang out with me.

100
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,533
I'll never be too cool.

101
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:13,706
Hey, is that the roof of your tree house?

102
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,708
Yeah, we just started to take it down.

103
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,711
I... I don't care. I mean, my, uh...

104
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,588
Tree houses are for kids anyway.

105
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,758
There's a lot of good memories
in there, right?

106
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,384
Yeah.

107
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,972
All right, tomorrow night. You. Me. Party.

108
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:31,807
Sounds good.

109
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,111
E.T. fingers.

110
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:48,408
- All right. See you, Cee.
- Bye-bye, Bee.

111
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,622
Gotta get that door fixed.
You're still giving this to me, right?

112
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,625
- One hundred percent.
- Can't have a sticky door on my car.

113
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:24,609
Hey, Mom!

114
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,362
Hey! Cole.

115
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,408
Cole, can you hand me one
of those traps, please?

116
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,117
Ow.

117
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:34,287
- Thanks. Hi.
- Hi.

118
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:35,997
Thanks, buddy.

119
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:39,959
God. God.

120
00:07:40,042 --> 00:07:42,602
Mom, how can you be under there?
There's like a trillion spiders.

121
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:46,466
Cole, I don't like it under here.
It's pretty much the worst.

122
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,594
- Do you think I'm a pussy, Mom?
- Ow.

123
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,696
Do you know what that word means?

124
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,642
- Yeah, like, afraid of everything.
- Ow.

125
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,017
Um...

126
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:57,559
Huh.

127
00:07:58,186 --> 00:07:59,437
Well...

128
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:05,526
I think... you are at a time in your life

129
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:08,446
where a lot of things are scary.

130
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:13,743
But as you get older, those same things
will stop frightening you as much.

131
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,327
Okay?

132
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,831
It's gonna be okay.

133
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,169
You should really get some
bug spray to kill the spiders in there.

134
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,506
What have they done to you?
They eat other dirty bugs.

135
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:28,257
Hey, will you get me a lemonade?

136
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,508
- Yep.
- Thanks.

137
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,597
Mom, I know "pussy" also means "vagina."
I'm not retarded.

138
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:40,436
Cole Johnson. Do not say "retarded."

139
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:43,081
But I can say "pussy" or "vagi..."

140
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,232
Don't say it, okay?

141
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,816
Go get me a lemonade.

142
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,656
Oh, my God, he said "pussy."

143
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,242
Breathe in. Breathe out.

144
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,827
- Unclench that sphincter.
- Okay.

145
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:59,413
- How those mirrors looking?
- Looking good.

146
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,497
Parking brakes?

147
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:02,166
Nope.

148
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,293
- Hands?
- Ten and two.

149
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,002
Engage.

150
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:15,304
Dad, did you know that seven teenagers
die a day from driving?

151
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,139
Really? Wow.

152
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:21,852
Did you know that, uh, 14 teenagers
die a day from over-worrying?

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,563
I went on the Internet,

154
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:26,107
and there's pictures of them.
They die like this:

155
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,279
Maybe next week.

156
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,115
All right, buddy, sure. You wanna swap?

157
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,450
- Yeah.
- Good. All right. You did good.

158
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,704
You started the car,
you put the seat belt on.

159
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:42,123
Don't worry about it, pal.
There's no rush.

160
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:44,917
It's okay to be scared.
It's not a big deal, okay?

161
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,672
Hey, let me ask you something.
Do your friends...

162
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,049
Do they make fun of you
for having a babysitter?

163
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:53,592
Yeah.

164
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:56,012
But then they see her
and get really jealous.

165
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,806
Yeah. Heck, yeah, they do.

166
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:01,851
I don't know about you, buddy,
but I'm feeling like a cop.

167
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,145
I'm craving some donuts.

168
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,065
All right!

169
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,452
What are you watching?

170
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:21,829
Your dad is bingeing on Mad Men.

171
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:22,912
Again.

172
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:24,373
You wouldn't like it.

173
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,125
It's on HBO?

174
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,794
No, it's not... It's not dirty, buddy.

175
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:29,754
It's not on HBO.

176
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,256
It's dense, you know.
So, it might go over your head.

177
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:35,092
When you get a little older,
we'll binge-watch it together.

178
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,052
How about that?

179
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,971
- All right.
- Cole, will you clean up the toys

180
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,139
in the hallway for me?

181
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,557
Okay, Mom. Jeez.

182
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:42,641
Thank you.

183
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,607
Much cleaner.

184
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,341
Who cares?

185
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,675
Hey. Oh.

186
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:19,762
Hey, that doesn't seem safe at all.

187
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,639
- I can handle it.
- Yeah. No, I get it.

188
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:22,722
Stop. Stop.

189
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,266
And hand me the knife.

190
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,020
Fabulous.
Why you cutting up your car with a knife?

191
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,731
I'm gonna switch the roof
with a fastback,

192
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,055
- so it's aerodynamic.
- Uh-huh.

193
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:34,276
It's gonna give me more downforce
on the turns.

194
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,362
When it hits the ramp,
it'll do a barrel roll

195
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,823
and smash into the crash zone
exactly how I intend...

196
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:41,617
Got it, got it.
I applaud your passion for aerodynamics.

197
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,829
I absolutely do, but only use this
if you're cutting a flank steak.

198
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,455
And don't do that. That's my job.

199
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,291
And if you take that job,
what am I doing at this house?

200
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,252
Do you want me to put it back?

201
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,021
No. I'm gonna put this
in the dishwasher,

202
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,172
'cause it's coated in my sweat and fear.

203
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:00,344
My parents are going away again.
I think they go to have sex,

204
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,347
but it just makes me feel like they go
to get away from me.

205
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,975
They're definitely having sex.

206
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,935
They probably have sex
when you're home, too.

207
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:12,064
Besides, I bet Bee has boys over
at your place all the time doing it.

208
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:13,190
Nope. No.

209
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:14,567
No way. Not a chance.

210
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,403
Yeah. That's what babysitters do.

211
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,657
They put the kids down,
sneak their boyfriends in. Doing it.

212
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:25,745
Seriously, have you ever been awake
after she's fallen asleep?

213
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,956
I dare you to stay up tonight. You'll see.

214
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,167
I'm gonna find out.

215
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,003
- Perv.
- No! I'm choking!

216
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:17,296
Pussy!

217
00:13:19,757 --> 00:13:23,469
Honey, not that I'm rushing you,
but weren't we supposed to leave at five?

218
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,596
No, honey,
5:30 to avoid holiday traffic.

219
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,181
We were supposed to leave at five.

220
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,850
Don't move the furniture around.
We just did the floors.

221
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,854
- I don't want your mom yelling.
- Got it.

222
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:34,522
I don't yell at you.
I just speak in all caps.

223
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,315
Right. That's what I love about her.

224
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,609
Here. Get that. It's probably Bee.

225
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:39,692
Okay.

226
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,987
- Can you hurry up?
- Yes.

227
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,663
- What up, Cee?
- What up, Bee?

228
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,750
- Hey, Bee. How are you?
- Oh, you know, can't complain.

229
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,502
- Good.
- Where to this weekend?

230
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,879
- Uh... The Hyatt. Living large.
- Mm!

231
00:13:58,963 --> 00:13:59,797
Can't find it!

232
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,841
Uh, try the bottom drawer
under your Invisalign.

233
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,261
Um, anyway, you know the drill.

234
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:08,138
No violent movies,
no junk food, bed by ten.

235
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,932
- Mom.
- Bed by 10:30?

236
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,618
- You serious?
- Anything else?

237
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,769
Uh, there is not a bathing suit
in that bedroom.

238
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:16,188
Then, honey,
I don't know what to tell you.

239
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,541
- I'm not up there.
- Okay.

240
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,111
- He's totally gonna bring his jean shorts.
- Mom, he calls them jorts.

241
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,531
- Well, we'll be fine. I can handle him.
- I know. You're the best.

242
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:28,200
- I'm bringing my jorts.
- I knew it!

243
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,953
- I'm bringing my jorts.
- I knew it. Great.

244
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,414
I will be the envy of women everywhere.

245
00:14:33,497 --> 00:14:35,958
Hey, uh, Bee,
call us if there's any trouble, okay?

246
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:38,144
- Cole, don't cause any trouble.
- Dad, I know.

247
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,545
You know what, honey?

248
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,499
- You got your flu shot, so no exertion.
- Mom.

249
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,009
- Yeah, no running around. Board games.
- Got it. Okay?

250
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,264
Hey, Cole, remember,
you're the man of the house now.

251
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,849
That's sweet. You are.

252
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,018
- We love you. Bye, Bee.
- I love you. Have fun.

253
00:14:54,143 --> 00:14:56,270
- But not too much fun.
- Not too much.

254
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,241

255

261

No way you're gonna beat my dive.

262
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,409
So, you're basically saying,
intergalactic dream team on a mission.

263
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:56,038
- Yeah. So, there's an epic villain, right?
- Right.

264
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,165
Okay, so, you have to fill a starship...

265
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:03,295
full of the best people or aliens
or robots to take them down.

266
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:05,089
- How many seats have I got?
- Five.

267
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:07,466
- Five?
- Six, if you need, like, a duo.

268
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,510
But you can't have a Predator
and Xenomorph.

269
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:11,387
They'd fight. The mission would be futile.

270
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,805
No, no, okay, I get it.

271
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,100
All right. One... Kirk.

272
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:17,226
Two, Picard.

273
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,688
Three, Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum
from Independence Day.

274
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:24,942
Five, Ripley, and six...
Are you ready for this shit?

275
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,860
A Xenomorph egg.

276
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,403
- No way.
- Yeah.

277
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:31,782
Yes. Yes. Okay. Here's the plan.

278
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,702
Kirk and Picard team up to captain,
then when they get close,

279
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,121
they send Will and Goldblum
to get inside the lair.

280
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:39,123
- They have experience with that.
- Fair.

281
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:41,667
Now, this whole time,
Ripley's been bitching

282
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,795
about the Xenomorph egg and shit,
'cause that's her move.

283
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,130
But she's gotta do this.

284
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:48,590
- It's the only way to save the world.
- The universe.

285
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,550
Right! Exactly!

286
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,594
So,
Will and Goldblum get her inside the lair.

287
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:57,016
Ripley personally drops off the egg,
the facehugger attacks the big bad!

288
00:16:57,266 --> 00:17:00,394
Ripley makes it back to Will and Goldblum,
the big bad attacks them,

289
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,979
they narrowly escape.

290
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,107
Kirk and Picard supply cover
as the spacecraft returns home,

291
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,445
then they peace out of there. Meanwhile,
the big bad starts feeling like shit...

292
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,450
He's out!

293
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,498
Who said he was a he?

294
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,378
- Shut up. A woman just saved the galaxy.
- Are facehuggers female?

295
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,172
No, 'cause they got dicks.

296
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,091
Oh, so, you're saying it took a dick
to save the galaxy.

297
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:34,136
I want a do-over.

298
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,889
- I want a do-over.
- No do-overs.

299
00:17:36,972 --> 00:17:40,392
Come on. Aliens don't abide
by our primitive gender stereotypes.

300
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,352
- What's done is done.
- You suck.

301
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:47,149
- You suck, and I hope you die.
- You couldn't live without me.

302
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,569
It would definitely affect my income.
So, you're probably right.

303
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,113
- Pizza!
- Pizza!

304
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:59,828
Big Indian Chief.
So special. So above the law.

305
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,248
I told you, you'd make a mistake,
and I'd be waiting.

306
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,254
It doesn't look
like I have any choice, does it?

307
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,882
That's right. You don't.

308
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:14,635
I'm gonna take this right foot...

309
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,932
and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face.

310
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,601
And you wanna know something?

311
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,771
There's not a damn thing
you're gonna be able to do about it.

312
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:28,607
- Really?
- Really.

313
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,671
Kill that Indian son of a bitch.

314
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:44,873
Think my parents are gonna get a divorce?

315
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,752
I don't know, man. I hope not.

316
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,631
Melanie's parents got divorced.
Her mom lives with her boyfriend.

317
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,799
That's gross.

318
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,469
Isn't that the cute chick
across the street?

319
00:18:57,928 --> 00:19:00,430
Ms. Dryer is not cute. She's gross.

320
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,849
Her boyfriend's like 20.

321
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,518
Not her. Melanie.

322
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,230
I wouldn't say she's cute.

323
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:11,066
Oh, I would.
I would say she's super-duper cute.

324
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:14,319
I see what you're trying to do.
It's not gonna work.

325
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,488
Whatever. You want your tongues to touch.

326
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,114
Nope. No way.

327
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,076
- Oh, you're in denial.
- You're an... asshole.

328
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,997
Oh, my God. That was so great.

329
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,543
But you'll be all right
if your parents break up.

330
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,588
I mean...
you just gotta take care of yourself.

331
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,508
Gotta figure out what you want,
and then do what you can to get it.

332
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:46,560
Ah, shit, dude, it's super late.

333
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,397
- I'm not tired.
- Well, I know you're not. I am.

334
00:19:51,773 --> 00:19:54,443
If I give you a shot, will you go to bed?

335
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:58,405
- I don't know, maybe.
- I'll make it a double.

336
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:01,241
- You'll sleep like a rock.
- Okay.

337
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:05,287
Here you are, my good sir.

338
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,040
Don't say a word of this to your parents.

339
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,501
My dad lets me drink Mike's all the time.

340
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,962
Dude, that is the coolest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

341
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:21,470
You're not gonna do it with me?

342
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,057
All right, sure. I'll be right back.

343
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,914
You did it without me?

344
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,251
Cheers.

345
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,336
Whew.

346
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,399
She's getting laid.

347
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,717
- I'm gonna find out.
- Wow, I'm impressed.

348
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,345
That's actually pervy, though,
watching people do it.

349
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm not a perv. I just wanna know
what happens after I go to sleep.

350
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:09,725
I gotta go.

351
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:14,064
No.

352
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Enter.

353
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,027
You sleepy?

354
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,364
Yeah, I'm really tired.

355
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,742
Well, rest up.
The party continues tomorrow.

356
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,912
You need anything? All right.

357
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,539
- Bee?
- Yeah?

358
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:37,754
Thanks for knowing me
and treating me like I was okay.

359
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,134
You don't think you're okay?

360
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,057
I mean...

361
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,646
I wanna feel normal, but...

362
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,068
I just feel weird most of the time.

363
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,990
Well, I like weird.

364
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,491
All of the time.

365
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:12,664
So, just imagine how all the girls
are gonna love you when you're a senior.

366
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,669
See you in the morning.

367
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,254
Good night, dude.

368
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,360
Ew. Orgy?

369
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:45,988
Orgy?

370
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:29,783
Spin it.

371
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,305
Whoo!

372
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,517
- Yeah!
- We lit. We lit.

373
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,726
Truth me.

374
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:02,524
Out of everybody here,
who would you want to sleep with the most?

375
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,653
- Sonya.
- Ooh, yeah.

376
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:08,947
Hundred percent.

377
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:12,200
- Come on.
- Sam, you're a close second, stud.

378
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,910
- Damn.
- Okay. My turn.

379
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:18,206
- Yo, people.
- To this bad girl.

380
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,083
Bee, truth or dare.

381
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,170
Dare.

382
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,674
I dare you to kiss everyone here.

383
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,968
- Yes.
- Ooh, yeah.

384
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,988
- She got balls.
- I need to watch.

385
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,515
All right.

386
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,310
- That's what I'm talking about.
- I'm excited for that.

387
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,163
- That's all I'm looking for.
- Hold on.

388
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,187
Let's go.

389
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:43,106

00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:54,034
- Thank you.
- Is that Lord of the Rings?

393
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:55,911
That was The Godfather Part II.

394
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,245
I love her.

395
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,100

Give me a second to process that shit.

That's amazing.

00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,531
Make sure it's real nice and long for you,
because I'm black. See that?

413
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,865
There you go. Mm.

414
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,244
Fuck, yeah.

415
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,661
Come on.

416
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,207
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

417
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:26,710
Oh, Bee!

418
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,421
Bee, what the hell?

419
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,382
You give her that romantic shit,
and you're gonna lick my face?

420
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,968
Damn, that's all I'm asking.

421
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,761
- All right.
- Freaky shit.

422
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:40,807
Smell good. The spit is nice.
Brushed your teeth this morning.

423
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,643
Okay.

424
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,231
- Weird.
- Hi.

425
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,775
Yeah!

426
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,486
Sammy's turn.

427
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,281
Sammy.

428
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,575
- She's so hot.
- Okay.

429
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,619
Come on, Sam. You got this.

430
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,246
Make out with her.

431
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,621
I'm sorry.

432
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:09,502
This is kind of weird.
I don't even really know you guys.

433
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,047
Come on, Sam.
Freak you out, there, stud?

434
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:14,924
- Sam, don't be a puss.
- I don't even know you guys.

435
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,301
I'm not. I'm... I just...

436
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:19,054
- You're staring at me.
- Oh, we're not looking.

437
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,347
Hey, it's not weird.

438
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,931
- Hey.
- Yeah.

439
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,266
Just close your eyes.

440
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:24,726
Okay?

441
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,311
Pretend they're not even here.

442
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:28,228
You can do this.

443
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,773
You got this.

444
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:39,032
Just because I close my eyes
doesn't mean that they're not here.

445
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:42,409
Do you trust me?

446
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:44,788
Yes.

447
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:46,039
Just relax.

448
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,250
It's not weird, okay?
We're just having fun.

449
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,672
There he goes.

450
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,621
Shh.

451
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:32,293
You're helping fulfill a great purpose.
Know this.

452
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,880
I don't wanna fulfill a great porpoise.

453
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,258
Did he just say "porpoise"?

454
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,592
Yo, I think he did.

455
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,761
He didn't even get a chance
to understand.

456
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,639
Ready?

457
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,475
- Ready.
- Yep.

458
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:50,687
Oh, okay.

459
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:53,356
That shit leaking.

460
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,406
Wait, hold on. My shit ain't working.
I think it ran out of blood.

461
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:04,159
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, shit.

462
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,953
Oh, shit!

463
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,914
All that blood was just in his boner.

464
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,917
Max, don't laugh, okay?
John, relax. This blood is serving you.

465
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,587
I did not sign up for this shit
to serve me in my mouth.

466
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:18,214
This shit's still warm.
I think he got a fever.

467
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:21,718
You know what you signed up for.
You want to go platinum, John?

468
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,429
Things can get messy
when you make a deal with the devil.

469
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:25,555
Now collect it.

470
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,949
- Like this?
- There you go.

471
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:30,435
How long is this gonna take?
I just want my shit to come true.

472
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,646
Allison, you'll all get what you want.

473
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:40,403
Okay, let's go.

474
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,074
I don't think this is funny.
Look at my outfit.

475
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,911
I just got this shit, you feel me?
Thirty percent off.

476
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:50,663
Macy's. Top rack. I don't play games.

477
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,415
You look like Carrie,

478
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:55,001
- but black.
- Carrie would've been better black.

479
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:57,629
She would have been covered in Hennessy,
all right?

480
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,340
What are you wearing?
Looking like Big Bird's side bitch.

481
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,551
I just came from a game.
That's why I'm wearing this, obviously.

482
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,011
I was not gonna miss this.

483
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:10,308
Look at this shit.
That would go viral so hard.

484
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,185
I mean, nobody's done human sacrifice.

485
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:14,229
People have always done human sacrifice.

486
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:18,233
Yeah, but, like...
not in America with hot people.

487
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:20,610
Sonya, get the cases.

488
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,613
Listen,
when you're done being totally useless,

489
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,617
get a rag and wipe Sacrifice Samuel
out my damn eye. OMG.

490
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:28,785
Hey.

491
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,869
Nice one, John.

492
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,247
Oh, my God.

493
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:35,124
I've got Sacrifice Samuel all over me.

494
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,293
What's in the box?

495
00:30:42,465 --> 00:30:45,969
Yo, so, Bee, why do you need the book
if you already know what to do?

496
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:48,304
It's like Jesus asking directions
to heaven.

497
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,931
Just fucking go up, you know?

498
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:54,102
Well, the Jews have their scrolls,

499
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,979
Christians have their Bibles,

500
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,856
and the devil has his verses.

501
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,817
Don't touch it.
It's very old and very delicate.

502
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,359
It's the only one.

503
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,613
You recite the verse
while the blood hits the page.

504
00:31:05,697 --> 00:31:07,323
Without it, none of this happens.

505
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:13,246
Let's get started before we head upstairs
and get the blood of the innocent.

506
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,486
911, what's your emergency?

507
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:30,471
My name is Cole Johnson.
A guy was murdered in my living room.

508
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:33,433
The address is, uh... 2455 Bigby Drive.

509
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,936
- Can you please send someone?
- Are the attackers still in the house?

510
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,605
They're downstairs having a blast.

511
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,648
- How many are there, Cole?
- Too many.

512
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:44,402
Can you please get my mom?
She's at the Hyatt in the city.

513
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,569
Living large.

514
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,157
Of course, Cole. Now listen to me.
It's important that you stay hidden.

515
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:53,453
- I gotta protect myself. Thanks.
- Do not do that. No, no, no...

516
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:23,650
Okay.

517
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,540
we shed about 15 percent
of our dead cells.

518
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:40,624
Whoo!

519
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:44,170
Yo, this kid's hobby
must be getting bullied.

520
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,382
He's reading The Secret?

521
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,051
He's ten years old.
What secret he need to know?

522
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,594
Won't he hear us?

523
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,973
With the amount of drugs I gave him?
Hell, no.

524
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:59,686
- Good boy. Pretty boy.
- Do you have the needle?

525
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,189
Of course, I have the needle.

526
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:11,197
You know, there is a faster way
to get all that blood.

527
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:14,047
What happens when you kill someone?

528
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,369
They lose, like,
all they Instagram followers.

529
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:19,497
- Oh, my God, that would suck.
- No, they die.

530
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,833
And then I'd have
to find another innocent kid.

531
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,628
And all of this only works
if we get that top-shelf pure shit.

532
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,340
And Cole is basically a faucet
of that for us.

533
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,187
After this, we finish the ritual...

534
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,732
and your wish comes true.

535
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,820
- Damn, I missed the vein.
- Mm.

536
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,450
Premium real estate. Go for it.

537
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,715
Wait, you gotta give him a Band-Aid.

538
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,467
Okay. Let's go mix some blood.

539
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,760
John, alley-oop.

540
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:15,928
LeBron James.

541
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,140
Good boy.

542
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,106
Why is he shirtless?

543
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,027
- That's your first question?
- How can you ask that? Just look at him.

544
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,195
I still don't get it.

545
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:02,869
Give him a cookie.

546
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,957
- No, thanks.
- Eat the cookie.

547
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,127
I just don't really like cookies, okay?
Bee knows that.

548
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:15,590
You'll feel better if you eat.
You fainted.

549
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,591
No, I didn't.

550
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:17,674
Yes, you did.

551
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,844
After I took your blood,

552
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,305
I waited in the room,
because something felt off.

553
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,224
I crouched behind the door.
A few seconds later, you got up,

554
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,935
tied a sheet to your bed,
threw the sheet out the window.

555
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:30,354
And then you fainted. So, you know...

556
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,356
Your blood sugar is low. Eat the cookie.

557
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,446
Are you mad at me?

558
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,490
Cookie.

559
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:45,411
This is gonna be so good.

560
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,079
What the...

561
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,082
Oh, there you go.

562
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,001
There you go.

563
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,422
That's a good boy.

564
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,266
- Why are you awake, Cole?
- Because I couldn't sleep.

565
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,230
- I don't believe you.
- Okay, fine. I...

566
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,895
I was gonna go smoke in the woods.

567
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,688
You were gonna go smoke
in the woods.

568
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,068
Yeah. You know, like... marijuana.

569
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:19,737
You weren't gonna share with your boy?
Come on, man.

570
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,490
We could've got high,
listen to my mix tape. My shit's fire.

571
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:24,951
- I wanna smoke pot.
- Why didn't you drink the shot?

572
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:27,370
Why is he shirtless?
Why did you take my blood?

573
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:29,997
- Cole.
- Okay. Fine. Because I don't like alcohol.

574
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,708
I just drank it
because I wanted you to think I was cool.

575
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,755
Why did you give a 12-year-old alcohol?

576
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:40,508
'Cause I put shit in that alcohol
that makes them conk out

577
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,759
for eight hours or more.

578
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,512
What else did you see?

579
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,390
I just see you.

580
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,143
And these assholes,
who I don't know, in my house.

581
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:57,358
- Why is his shirt covered in blood?
- No one would let me borrow a shirt.

582
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:00,361
- That's not even an answer.
- Oh, my God.

583
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:03,948
Does he not see the mirror behind him?
We can see you cutting the rope.

584
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,784
Well, he does now.

585
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,205
Aw, it's so cute,
you're still cutting the rope.

586
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:13,833
Look at you.
You're really trying there, aren't you?

587
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,712
- Why are you cutting ropes?
- I don't like being tied up.

588
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:19,672
- Why do you have a knife?
- It was a gift.

589
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:20,755
Oh, my God.

590
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:22,633
He's still cutting the ropes.

591
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:25,136
Determined little fucker, aren't you?

592
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,140
Look, I won't tell anyone.

593
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,684
Okay? You know me.
I'm good with secrets.

594
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,437
I won't tell my parents
that you were having an orgy

595
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,855
and needed my blood to do it.

596
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,488
Do you even know what an orgy is?

597
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,074
I'm guessing it's something sad people do

598
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,535
'cause they want other sad people
to like them,

599
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,039
and they can forget for one minute
how sad they are in general.

600
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,000
That's actually a pretty good answer.

601
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,794
It was for a science project, okay?

602
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:00,545
The orgy?

603
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:02,381
No. The blood.

604
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:04,717
Orgy is when a bunch of people
have sex together.

605
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,280
We wouldn't need your blood for that.

606
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,723
You could've just asked.

607
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,768
I would've let you have some blood
for science.

608
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,644
I knew you were afraid of needles.

609
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,688
This was clearly a misunderstanding.

610
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,939
Sonya, untie him.

611
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,984
I'm sorry we scared you, Cole. We good?

612
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,905
Oh, shit.

613
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,741
- Shut up!
- Holy fuck!

614
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,868
- Not good.
- Fucking police.

615
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,204
Why are the cops outside, Cole?

616
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,206
- I don't know.
- Did you call them?

617
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:38,060
- No. You said you were in the room.
- Makes me think you saw something

618
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,461
that scared you enough
to call the cops. Right, Cole?

619
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,839
Oh, fuck!

620
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,007
Answer me, Cole.

621
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,968
Help! Help!
I'm tied up inside! They're about...

622
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,096
Ow.

623
00:39:51,097 --> 00:39:52,737
- Oh, shit!
- Everybody, freeze!

624
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:55,351
Hands up, now!
Put your hands up! Now!

625
00:39:55,434 --> 00:39:56,477
- Now!
- Here we go.

626
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,937
- Hands up!
- Oh!

627
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,690
Shit!

628
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:05,319
Hands up. Don't shoot, man.
Black lives matter, too. You feel me?

629
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,862
Bee!

630
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:07,987
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

631
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,824
Titty gone!

632
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:11,492
Titty gone!

633
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,662
Don't you move. Keep your hands up.
Nobody move!

634
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,498
Don't you move.

635
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:18,916
Chill with the gun stuff.

636
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,085
Chill. You Mexican, right?
Look, I speak Spa...

637
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,212
Lo siento, my nigga, lo siento.

638
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:28,426
Are you serious?

639
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,139
Max, what you doing, man?

640
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,558
- Max, what you doing, man?
- No, no, no!

641
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,560
Oh.

642
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,479
No!

643
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:44,275
Harder.

644
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,405
Whoo!

645
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,283
Look, man.
Three out of four people got an STD.

646
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,034
I got two people's blood on me.

647
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:57,288
You do the math.
I got AIDS. I know I got AIDS.

648
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,664
You killed him!

649
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:01,417
- Kind of your fault, bud.
- Are you insane?

650
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,835
No, Cole. I'm just trying...

651
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:06,589
What's the status
of that 187 call on Bigby Drive?

652
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,426
Look, man.

653
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,761
I can't go to jail.
Y'all killed the cops, man.

654
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,555
I ain't involved with this shit.

655
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,098
It's fine. Max, pick it up.

656
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:19,059
It's the statistics.

657
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,645
They say you either end up in jail
or dead.

658
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,064
It's gonna be both for me, Bee.

659
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,859
- What's the code for "all clear"?
- What's your status?

660
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,986
Just say "all clear."

661
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,529
Why would he know cop codes?

662
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,116
Stop screaming and act like an adult.

663
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,076
What's the code? I know you know it.

664
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,204
Little boy here a nerd.
Tell them the codes.

665
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,787
What's the code?

666
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,041
- Ten-fifty-three.
- Punch that shit in.

667
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,044
- Bynak, you there?
- Wait.

668
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:50,007
You don't get it.
You look away when you lie.

669
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,136
You look me in the eyes
and tell me the truth.

670
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,971
What is the code for "all clear"?

671
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,022
It's 10-4. Obviously.

672
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,274
What's "we're taking a break to get food"?

673
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:09,438
- Say we're taking a break to...
- Cole.

674
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,445
Officer Bynak, you need backup?

675
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,072
Code seven.

676
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,870
Ten-four, all clear. We're code seven.

677
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,141
Ten-four.
Enjoy your double-double.

678
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,382
Should've been a cop.

679
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:37,930
Shit.

680
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:39,640
Ow, ow!

681
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:42,685
Oh, my God. Guys.

682
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,521
Oh, my God!

683
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,940
Fucking help me. What are you doing?

684
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,484
Oh, my God. He shot me in the boob.

685
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,362
What kind of dick shoots a girl
in the boob?

686
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:58,200
- I did not sign up for this shit.
- Stop complaining. Stop all your whining.

687
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,203
They're totally gonna stop growing.
They weren't even done.

688
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:03,122
Sometimes you gotta settle, all right?

689
00:43:03,205 --> 00:43:05,499
I got a cousin Chantelle, titties flat.

690
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,917
Personality real good.

691
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,460
Ow. Oh, my God.

692
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,462
Ow! You fucking bitch.

693
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,714
What's wrong with you?

694
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:16,135
- Get away from me with your fucking beret.
- She's gonna bleed out.

695
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,052
What? No.

696
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,180
What do you mean, I'm gonna bleed?

697
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,433
Can we just stick a tampon in it
or something?

698
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,978
Oh, my God.
We need to call an ambulance, guys.

699
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,814
I need an ambulance.
I don't wanna lose my boob.

700
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:29,940
I can't do that.

701
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,024
What?

702
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,692
Why not?

703
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,070
Because your boob was shot
by a now-dead cop.

704
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,322
Have fun explaining that.

705
00:43:36,405 --> 00:43:38,782
No dude's gonna motorboat these, Bee.

706
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,037
How you like it?
You want them quick or you want them long?

707
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:46,040
You want a little spit on them?

708
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,208
Cole!

709
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,175
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, hey, hey.

710
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:53,589
Who's gonna want to suck on my nipples?

711
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:54,715
No one.

712
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,884
Cole. Come here, Cole.
Stop running.

713
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,845
Come here, little baby.
Yeah. Come here, buddy.

714
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:01,930
Just wanna talk. Just wanna talk.

715
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,724
Son of a bitch.

716
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,726
Hey, this ain't Home Alone.
Hey, hey, hey.

717
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,101
Oh, shit.

718
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,698
Oh, shit.

719
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:23,494
Right in the jugular. Yeah!

720
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:27,915
- Get him.
- I got him.

721
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,209
I'm gonna kill you with my bare hands.

722
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,126
Whoo!

723
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,671
- Now I gotta clean this up.
- Run, Cole!

724
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,798
I'm coming for you.

725
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:38,884
Open the door, Cole.

726
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,305
No locked doors, Cole!

727
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:46,266
Open the door. We just wanna talk, Cole.

728
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,896
Come on, Cole!

729
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,496
Hey, Coley. How's it hanging?

730
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,917
Please, don't kill me. Please.

731
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,548
No. You're gonna kill me. No.

732
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:21,385
Max. It's okay, Max. Please.

733
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,138
Got you.

734
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:26,807
Ow!

735
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,601
Whoa. Deep breaths, buddy.

736
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,695
I'm right on your ass, Coley!

737
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,821
Keep moving!

738
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:44,450
Come on, Cole!

739
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,579
Where are you, you little shit?

740
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:50,539
Cole.

741
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,415
Coley.

742
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:23,155
There's a dead guy...

743
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:26,115
I'm sorry.

744
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,035
I'm sorry.

745
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,376
Okay. Okay. Okay.

746
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:39,296
Bug spray. Blanket.

747
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,466
Lighter.

748
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,645
Whoa. The Fat Dragon.

749
00:46:58,732 --> 00:46:59,732
Coley!

750
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:03,403
Cole!

751
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,909
Come out and play!

752
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,244
Is this where you are?

753
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,670
Are you right... here?

754
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,849
Good boy.

755
00:49:41,061 --> 00:49:42,729
Beautiful boy.

756
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:47,567
So soft, so pretty.

757
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,319
Coley!

758
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:53,031
- Where's Cole?
- Ugh.

759
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:58,286
Sonya, bring your cookies
and help me find this little fuck.

760
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,122
I'm coming.

761
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,928
Hi, Cole.

762
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,180
Oh, God.

763
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:20,767
How long do you think
it'll take your parents

764
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,895
to find your body down here?

765
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,521
Tomorrow?

766
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,150
Two days from now?

767
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:29,901
Even later?

768
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:34,281
Probably when your body starts
to reek like cheese.

769
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:38,076
Or we could just burn your body, Cole.

770
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,287
It would be so beautiful.

771
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,458
Oh, you missed.

772
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:48,044
My nails!

773
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:53,425
Cole! Cole!

774
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:01,057
I'm gonna make sure
you hurt before you die, Cole.

775
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:07,314
Cut your fingers off. Every single one.

776
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,774
Come here, Cole!

777
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:11,860
I'm making
a human self-centipede. Yeah!

778
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,241
Human self-centipede, child!

779
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,577
Gonna taste so good, Cole!

780
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,163
Your mouth is gonna get sewn
to your ass, Cole!

781
00:51:23,246 --> 00:51:25,040
Your mouthy ass!

782
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:42,140
I'm still alive motherfuck...

783
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,121
Did you just blow up Sonya?

784
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:07,498
No.

785
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,086
I mean, I'm not even mad.
I'm a little surprised.

786
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,587
What did that?

787
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,588
A firework.

788
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:15,465
A firework?

789
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:16,800
Holy shit.

790
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:18,969
Damn, good for you, kid.

791
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:20,971
That is awesome.

792
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:23,306
So, you want a head start?

793
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,269
- Come on, you're the quarterback.
- Life's not fair, dude.

794
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:28,436
You guys suck.

795
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:29,646
You just blew up Sonya.

796
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,317
You can't outrun me, Cole.

797
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:40,365
Wait until they've almost got you,
drop like a bag of rocks.

798
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:44,661
Kick him in the dick.

799
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:45,744
Dick.

800
00:52:55,630 --> 00:52:56,630
Whoo!

801
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,427
You missed my dick.

802
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:02,971
- No, I didn't.
- Pretty sure you did.

803
00:53:03,054 --> 00:53:04,180
And I got a big dick.

804
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:05,807
No, you don't.

805
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,017
That's just hurtful.

806
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:10,896
Please, don't... Don't...

807
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:16,192
No whining.

808
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,276
Save some dignity.

809
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,244
What the hell is that?

810
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:27,787
- Huh?
- It's Jeremy.

811
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:30,081
- What?
- Eggs.

812
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,125
Eggs.

813
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:33,667
Eggs?

814
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,129
You gotta be shitting me.

815
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:38,590
Somebody's egging your house?

816
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:47,598
Who is this kid?

817
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,476
Just an asshole.

818
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,269
- He egg your house a lot?
- Sometimes.

819
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,356
- So, what are you gonna do about it?
- What?

820
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:57,567
I said, are you gonna let that little punk
come on to your property,

821
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:00,070
your family's property
and disrespect you like that?

822
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:09,037
No. Hell, no. This is America.
You need to wreck his ass.

823
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,832
Are you kidding me?

824
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,001
Get out there and crush that bitch.

825
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:16,752
Go.

826
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,634
Well, well, well.

827
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,511
It's Cole sore.

828
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,554
I like your pajamas.

829
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,182
Thanks. My mom made them.

830
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,685
You wanna do something?

831
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,063
You know what I'm gonna do?

832
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,189
What's that?

833
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,235
I'm gonna take this right foot,

834
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:44,114
and I'm gonna whop you
on that side of your face.

835
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:49,494
And there's not a damn thing
you can do about it.

836
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:51,496
Really?

837
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,207
Really.

838
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:58,086
I'm gonna wreck your ass.

839
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,094
What the hell was that?
You must be crazy.

840
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,638
Jeremy, you have to listen to me, okay?

841
00:55:08,888 --> 00:55:11,224
There's a guy over there
who's trying to kill me.

842
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:13,184
- I swear to God.
- I swear to God.

843
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,811
- I'm serious.
- I'm serious.

844
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,646
There are dead bodies in my house.

845
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:20,525
- Wait, seriously?
- The cops came. They killed the cops.

846
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:24,404
- Where is the cop car?
- They're crazy. They're covering it up.

847
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,907
Okay? If you get me out of this,
I'll wear a blue headband.

848
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,994
I'll give you foot massages.
I'll do your homework until college.

849
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,412
Oh, okay, okay.

850
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,163
I'll help you.

851
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:36,332
- Really?
- Yeah.

852
00:55:36,416 --> 00:55:38,793
I mean, if you die,
who am I gonna pick on?

853
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:41,170
Exactly.

854
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:43,298
Okay, so, here's the plan.

855
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,967
On three,
we're gonna make a run for my bike.

856
00:55:46,051 --> 00:55:48,762
- You're gonna ride in the back. All right?
- Thank you.

857
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,431
One, two...

858
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,146
Have fun getting murdered, colon cancer.

859
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:00,272
Ooh-whah, ooh-whah.

860
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,317
Ooh-whah, ooh-whah.

861
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,324
You talk too much.

862
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,618
Crack him in the face next time.

863
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,205
Not bad.
At least you stood up for yourself.

864
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,208
You gonna let me go now?

865
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:22,836
No.

866
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,550
But if you kill me,
you won't get what you want.

867
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,511
No, I'm not like the others.

868
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:31,262
I came here to kill people.

869
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:36,643
Yes! That's what I'm talking about, Cole!

870
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:38,436
Come on, buddy! Whoo!

871
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,107
Come on, Coley.

872
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,652
Come on, buddy. I'm right behind you.
Move your ass, Cole.

873
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:47,487
Whoo!

874
00:56:48,279 --> 00:56:49,447
Coming for you.

875
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:51,324
Whoo!

876
00:56:52,075 --> 00:56:53,618
Come on, buddy. Get moving.

877
00:56:57,038 --> 00:56:58,123
Come on, buddy.

878
00:56:58,748 --> 00:56:59,748
Let's go!

879
00:57:00,583 --> 00:57:02,502
Come on! Get up there! Come on!

880
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:04,879
Coley.

881
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:08,091
Come down and play.

882
00:57:12,428 --> 00:57:13,428
Coley.

883
00:57:16,182 --> 00:57:17,182
Come on, Cole.

884
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:22,021
Chi-chi-chi, chi-chi-chi, ah.

885
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,317
Chi-chi-chi, chi-chi-chi, ah.

886
00:57:27,318 --> 00:57:28,820
Stuck in the tree.

887
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:30,947
No way down!

888
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,410
Coley.

889
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,748
Coley.

890
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:44,210
Coley.

891
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,591
Where is he?

892
00:58:11,488 --> 00:58:13,031
You're a badass kid.

893
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:14,698
Relax, Max.

894
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,496
You don't have to do this.

895
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,165
Well, I kind of have to do this.

896
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,878
Don't worry. I'm not gonna let you die
with egg on your face.

897
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:29,005
You poor bastard.

898
00:58:29,088 --> 00:58:30,924
You deserve better than this.

899
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:40,183
Tonight you get an honorable death.

900
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:42,560
Tonight you die a man.

901
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:44,604
I don't wanna die a man.

902
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,835
Why are there guns?

903
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,305
Come here. Come here.

904
00:59:20,557 --> 00:59:23,142
- Was that a gun?
- I got the two guys and the Asian girl.

905
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:25,979
- The cheerleader got shot. It's just Bee.
- What is going on?

906
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:29,148
Bee murdered the geek. Stole my blood.
Tied me up. Killed the cops.

907
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,568
- You're really freaking me out.
- I'm... sorry.

908
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,944
Bee is bad?

909
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,073
Yeah. Bee is bad.

910
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,701
- Where's your dad?
- Out with some Protestant.

911
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:42,996
- But his car's here.
- She picked him up. He's really desperate.

912
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:45,748
Am I the only one
that still has a babysitter?

913
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:47,499
Yeah.

914
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,420
- So, what do we do?
- Pray.

915
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:53,506
- Okay.
- I was kidding.

916
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,883
- Oh.
- But it's probably a great idea, though.

917
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:01,471
Come on.

918
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:12,066
- You think she can get in here?
- Not if it's locked.

919
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,569
Your door automatically locks,
right?

920
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,405
Nope.

921
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:23,990
- I shouldn't have gotten you into this.
- You were being shot at.

922
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,908
Especially because I was being shot at.

923
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:28,828
You're my best friend, I'm sorry.
I'm gonna take care of this.

924
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:30,288
- Do you have your phone?
- Yeah.

925
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:33,916
- Call the cops. Tell them it's a 10-53.
- Why do you know cop codes?

926
01:02:34,459 --> 01:02:37,462
Because I used to wanna be a cop
when I grew up.

927
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:40,715
You never told me that.

928
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:43,176
I know. I only told Bee.

929
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:47,971
Are you okay?

930
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:51,476

944

That was sweet of you.

945
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,317
I'm really excited we kissed.

946
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,986
Me, too. Let's make out next time.

947
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:46,321
Okay. Bye.

948
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,246
Come and get me, Bee!

949
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,414
I'm right here!

950
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:56,958
It's just you and me!

951
01:03:57,250 --> 01:03:58,543
It's just you and me!

952
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:00,878
What, you're gonna get shy now?!

953
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,214
I'm going towards my house!

954
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,757
I'm right here, Bee!

955
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,092
I'm right here!

956
01:04:08,803 --> 01:04:09,971
What the hell?

957
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,807
Oh, my God. Where is everything?

958
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:21,899
Oh, my God.

959
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,008
"Sacrifice... Get your dreams..."

960
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:19,809
- Get off me!
- I'm gonna kill you!

961
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,228
I'm gonna kill you!

962
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,815
Oh, my God!

963
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,024
Oh, my God!

964
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:30,695
What's wrong with you,
you little pervert?

965
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:34,198
What? You can't make me feel bad
because I defended myself.

966
01:06:34,281 --> 01:06:38,285
I knew you wanted me this whole time,
upstairs in your little room jerking off.

967
01:06:38,369 --> 01:06:40,830
- You're just sick.
- You were trying to kill me.

968
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:43,457
I wasn't trying to kill you
by punching your dick.

969
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:46,585
I've never felt
so violated before.

970
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,169
Oh, God.

971
01:06:48,546 --> 01:06:52,174
I only signed up for this dumb shit
so I could have my dream job.

972
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:54,176
And instead, what do I have now, huh?

973
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:56,344
This.

974
01:06:56,721 --> 01:07:00,433
One deflated, ugly boob.

975
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:03,227
My life is basically over.

976
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:08,983
I... I mean... you're still super hot.

977
01:07:09,066 --> 01:07:10,776
What kind of job do you want?

978
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:13,820
Journalist.

979
01:07:17,074 --> 01:07:18,576
See, that's perfect.

980
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:21,996
Because you're super smart,
and you're hot,

981
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,040
- and really driven.
- Thank you.

982
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,876
I could be wrong,
but I don't think it would be hard for you

983
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:28,544
to have a cool life.

984
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:30,211
Really?

985
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:33,799
You think so? You think maybe
we could walk out of this whole thing?

986
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:38,054
Just call the police and just,
you know, forget this ever happened?

987
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,137
Yeah.

988
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:40,306
Exactly.

989
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:43,601
Do you think I give a fuck
what you're talking about?

990
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:58,699
Knife. Where's the knife?

991
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:03,079
Oh! Dishwasher.

992
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:06,706
Mom.

993
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:11,045
Are you the one that put the knife
in the dishwasher?

994
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:12,463
I think so.

995
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:15,049
Can you not do that?
It goes in the butcher block.

996
01:08:18,135 --> 01:08:19,136
Yoo-hoo!

997
01:08:20,763 --> 01:08:21,806
Looking for this?

998
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:23,974
You still think I'm pretty?

999
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,527
Oh, you think
I'm scared of a little fire, huh?

1000
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,195
You are dying.

1001
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,489
You, you are dying.

1002
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:40,074
You ruined my life.

1003
01:08:41,075 --> 01:08:45,121
And now, I'm gonna ruin yours!

1004
01:08:51,669 --> 01:08:53,337
Holy shit.

1005
01:08:56,257 --> 01:08:58,676
I found this in the cop car.
That was so graphic.

1006
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:02,721
She was so annoying.

1007
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:06,809
I wanna throw up.

1008
01:09:06,892 --> 01:09:07,892
You and me both.

1009
01:09:09,270 --> 01:09:10,270
Where's Sonya?

1010
01:09:10,396 --> 01:09:12,481
Blown up. Crawlspace.
Where are the cops?

1011
01:09:12,565 --> 01:09:13,858
Ditched them with the car.

1012
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:16,777
Now I gotta skip town again.

1013
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,363
And that leaves you,
and what to do with you.

1014
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:22,283
- Any suggestions?
- Are you gonna shoot me?

1015
01:09:22,825 --> 01:09:23,825
No.

1016
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:27,830
No. I was just shooting around you,
'cause I thought you'd put your hands up.

1017
01:09:31,750 --> 01:09:33,043
I will burn your book!

1018
01:09:36,380 --> 01:09:37,380
Cole.

1019
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:42,803
- Cole, listen to me.
- No.

1020
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,139
- Cole, listen to me.
- No, Bee! You listen to me!

1021
01:09:46,223 --> 01:09:50,978
I've been hunted,
you've stolen my blood, killed people,

1022
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:53,981
shot at me,
and just been general assholes all night.

1023
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:56,942
So, I wanna know
what the hell's going on.

1024
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:00,738
Cole, you're too young to understand,
okay? Just trust me.

1025
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:01,947
Fuck you!

1026
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:02,865
Cole.

1027
01:10:02,948 --> 01:10:04,700
No. You know what? You deserved that.

1028
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:09,121
What, just because I'm 12 means I get
to be treated like total shit

1029
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:11,874
by you and Jeremy and everyone else?

1030
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:14,835
You know what?
You're Don Draper from Mad Men.

1031
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,963
How he's all cool and handsome
and everybody loves him,

1032
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:21,008
then he goes home and you find out
he has a wife the whole time.

1033
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:24,637
- He's such a piece of shit!
- Did you just ruin Mad Men for me?

1034
01:10:25,471 --> 01:10:27,514
It's not even on anymore. You'll live.

1035
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,724
Still.

1036
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,146
- What happens when you leave here?
- What do you mean?

1037
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:35,940
- I will burn this!
- Okay.

1038
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:38,609
Cole... what do you want to know?

1039
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:42,321
What's the blood for?

1040
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:46,242
You mix the blood of the innocent
with the blood of someone sacrificed,

1041
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:48,077
recite the verses,

1042
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,828
while dripping it on the page.

1043
01:10:50,871 --> 01:10:53,082
And, basically, you get whatever you want.

1044
01:10:56,710 --> 01:11:00,798
I used to be so small... and so scared.

1045
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:06,845
Now I'm strong... and I'm confident...

1046
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,224
and that's all I ever wanted.

1047
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:15,521
And, so, that's all I was to you.

1048
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:21,568
You just used me to get what you wanted.

1049
01:11:22,695 --> 01:11:23,695
No.

1050
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:26,782
No, Cole. I chose you.

1051
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,286
I mean,
I could've shot you and not Allison,

1052
01:11:30,369 --> 01:11:31,912
but I didn't. I chose you.

1053
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,914
'Cause you're the best.

1054
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:36,250
We click, right? You're my guy.

1055
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,548
I'm not the first kid, am I?

1056
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,138
No.

1057
01:11:50,931 --> 01:11:53,976
And you'll leave here
and just find another faucet.

1058
01:11:54,518 --> 01:11:58,480
- You heard that?
- I heard everything. This is my house.

1059
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:01,316
Okay.

1060
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,401
Okay, yes.

1061
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:07,698
And tonight sucked,
but we can start again.

1062
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:13,495
So, you have a plan?

1063
01:12:14,121 --> 01:12:16,206
Yeah. We just say they attacked us.

1064
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,541
I got him.

1065
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,335
Whoo!

1066
01:12:32,264 --> 01:12:34,308
Plus, dude, we would have so much fun.

1067
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:37,478
Just you and me against the whole world.

1068
01:12:38,020 --> 01:12:39,938
No one will ever hurt you ever again.

1069
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:43,275
There'll be nothing left to be afraid of.
Isn't that what you wanted?

1070
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:48,906
What do you say, Cole?

1071
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:55,203
I guess...

1072
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,794
I guess I have a plan, too.

1073
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,006
No!

1074
01:13:06,423 --> 01:13:07,549
No!

01:15:22,893 --> 01:15:25,187
You drove a car into your house.

1095
01:15:28,148 --> 01:15:29,816
I really didn't see that coming.

1096
01:15:37,866 --> 01:15:39,076
You never told me...

1097
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:42,913
your intergalactic dream team.

1098
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:44,957
You didn't ask.

1099
01:15:45,582 --> 01:15:46,582
I should have.

1100
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:49,586
I'm usually pretty good at that stuff.

1101
01:15:55,175 --> 01:15:56,843
Admiral Adama to lead.

1102
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:02,307
Data for his intelligence and cool head.

1103
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,603
Predator to fight.

1104
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,399
Then me and you.

1105
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:20,576
You didn't say we could add ourselves.

1106
01:16:22,411 --> 01:16:24,788
It's science fiction. You can do anything.

1107
01:16:26,456 --> 01:16:29,459
Well... I guess that's true.

1108
01:16:33,297 --> 01:16:34,673
But don't you get it yet?

1109
01:16:39,886 --> 01:16:41,388
I am the big bad.

1110
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,476
I loved you.

1111
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:59,489
I don't care about your dumb book
or your stupid cult.

1112
01:17:00,866 --> 01:17:01,866
I'm an adult...

1113
01:17:02,701 --> 01:17:05,329
because when I realized
you were the big bad...

1114
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:07,456
and you betrayed me

1115
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:09,458
and were just gonna hurt other kids,

1116
01:17:10,751 --> 01:17:12,961
I drove a stolen car through you.

1117
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,179
That, I'll give you.

1118
01:17:25,766 --> 01:17:26,766
I'll see you, Cee.

1119
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:32,855
Goodbye.

1120
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:15,750
- Martinez.
- Yeah?

1121
01:18:15,774 --> 01:18:17,401
Protect and serve, idiot.

1122
01:18:17,484 --> 01:18:19,319
- It's just a car.
- Protect my car.

1123
01:18:19,403 --> 01:18:21,488
Just a car?! Just a car?!

1124
01:18:22,614 --> 01:18:24,574
Do not... Put your hand down right now.

1125
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,122
- I thought you were gonna drive away.
- I couldn't leave you.

1126
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:32,999
That was such a douche car.

1127
01:18:33,500 --> 01:18:35,502
Melanie, get over here.

1128
01:18:35,585 --> 01:18:37,671
Get back here. Now.

1129
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,133
Bye.

1130
01:18:42,509 --> 01:18:43,969
Oh, my God.

1131
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:47,097
Did you just put your face on him?
Wanna go get tattoos now?

1132
01:18:47,347 --> 01:18:48,557
Yo. What happened?

1133
01:18:49,516 --> 01:18:51,226
Dude, Cole stole a car.

1134
01:18:51,309 --> 01:18:53,729
Rammed his house. Killed, like, 50 people.

1135
01:18:54,896 --> 01:18:57,149
Fifty people.

1136
01:18:57,899 --> 01:18:59,693
Hey, let's get out of here.

1137
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,029
Today, y'all. Let's go.

1138
01:19:09,995 --> 01:19:11,246
The hell?

1139
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:15,750
Cindy.

1140
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:19,004
- Do you have my son? Please...
- Cole.

1141
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:23,675
Honey. Honey. Oh, my God.

1142
01:19:25,385 --> 01:19:26,636
Are you okay? Are you...?

1143
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:28,722
- I'm okay.
- Are you all right?

1144
01:19:28,805 --> 01:19:30,807
- Oh, my God. What happened?
- Is that blood?

1145
01:19:30,891 --> 01:19:33,268
Hey. What happened?

1146
01:19:39,691 --> 01:19:41,610
