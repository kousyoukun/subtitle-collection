你准备怎么做呢,上校？

21
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:54,016
我们有600个人,我们不同意
There are 600 of us and we don't agree.

22
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,325
你是在逼我用暴力
You leave me no alternative but to result to force.

23
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,673
好斗的家伙,是吧？

00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,889
毫无意义
There's nothing for it.

29
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,396
- 带他们过来  - 是,长官
- Bring 'em up.   - Yes, sir.

30
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,331
考科斯上校,把那些人带到这里

来呀,我们走！
Come on, let's go!

39
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:08,985
我不参与,明白吗？
I want no part of this, understand?

40
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:11,422
卫兵听着...
All guard towers...

41
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,822

不要开枪...

除非犯人越过警戒线

44
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,388
明白吗？
Is that understood?

45
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,023
停火
Cease firing.

46
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,026
出来,你这德国脏猪！
Come out, you kraut swine!

47
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:54,562
你干吗不进来？！
Why don't you come in here?!

48
00:07:58,703 --> 00:07:59,635
狗娘养的！
Bastards!

49
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,799
催泪弹准备
Gas grenades in.

50
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:16,309
催泪弹,他们过线了
Tear gas, they're past the wire.

51
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:41,669
快！快点！

52
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:58,521
我要12个人。6人跟着我,6人去后面
I want 12 men. Six with me and six around the back.

快速行动！去另一边！
Those men, pronto! Cover the other side!

54
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,217
退后站成一线！
Drop back and form a line!

55
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:33,894
上刺刀！
Fix bayonets!

56
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,172
塔楼士兵听着...
All guard towers...

57
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:46,740
他们越过警戒线就开枪
there is to be no shooting unless they cross the trip wire.

58
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:55,248
士兵,站好岗位！
Soldiers, stand guard!

59
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,048
冲上去！
Move it up!

60
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:05,429
快！去那里！围住那边
Hurry up! Get in there! Go round that side.

61
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,369
是德国空军...关键时候
Is the Luftwaffe...above all this.

62
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,203
快  - 走啊
Come on   - get going.

63
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,074
去死吧
Go to the devil.

64
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:26,775
真是一群傻蛋
What a bunch of idiots.

65
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:48,163
把英国兵弄出去。出去！...出去！...出去！
Get the Tommies out of here. Out!...Out!...Out!

66
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:51,975
关上门！
Close the gates!

67
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,195
把你的手拷送回伦敦吧,佩里上校
Send your handcuffs back to London, Major Perry.

68
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:23,139
施莱特上尉,日内瓦协议授权与我
Captain Schleutter, I'm entitled by the Geneva Convention...

69
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,177
惩罚你们这怪诞的行为！
to punish you and your men for this incredible behavior!

70
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:30,943
你们将被限食限行动48小时
You'll be confined to your huts on restricted diet for 48 hours!

71
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,678
所有的优待及电力
All privileges and electric power...

72
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,913
将被缩减
will be curtailed for that period.

73
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,613
限制结束后
And at the end of that period...

74
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:43,787
你们要有秩序地集合点名
you will fall in for roll call in proper order.

75
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:45,796
就象现在这样
As indeed you are now.

76
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:50,531
把你的手拷送回伦敦,否则离开我们的营地
Send your handcuffs back to London and stay out of our camp until you do.

77
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:55,832
你和某个军人发生关系
Did you have relations with an enlisted personnel...

78
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:57,841
康纳上尉？
Captain Connor?

79
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:01,178
是的,长官
I did, sir.

80
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,511
她是自愿的
She was willing.

81
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,642
你是否打了海军军官？
Did you strike an officer of His Majesty's Navy?

82
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:11,450
没有,我只说了些事
Not at all. I said something or other.

83
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:15,619
他推了我一下,没什么
He gave me a sort of push. It wasn't anything.

84
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,993
警察报告中写着“恶化事态的攻击”
The police report called it "aggravated assault."

85
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:20,031
是吗？
Did it?

86
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,895
记录显示你是
Your past record indicates that you were...

87
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:26,061
和4个军人喝醉了...
drunk with four enlisted men...

88
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:30,039
擅离职守
and absent without leave...

89
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,871
6次
six times.

90
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:35,879
现在你等候调职
Even though you are currently awaiting orders for your next posting...

91
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:38,848
并不是说可以忽视条例...
that is not a license to ignore military regulations...

92
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,885
给军队带来耻辱
and bring disgrace to the uniform.

93
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,385
是,长官
Yes, sir.

94
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:46,083
根据记录
It is within the authority of this review board...

95
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,921
要降低你的职位使用
to reduce you in rank to the lowest commissioned rating.

96
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:54,488
然而,我们应情报部要求
However, we have been requested to hold our decision in abeyance...

97
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,500
暂停处理
by His Majesty's lntelligence.

98
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,834
- 克尔将军有话问你  - 是本・克尔？
- General Kerr wishes to question you.   - Ben Kerr?

99
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,840
又乱套了不是,杰克？
So it's a balls-up again, eh, Jack?

100
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,002
将军总是觉得军队糟糕才象个将军
The army must be in a bad way for generals, makin' you one.

101
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,208
- 你总算明白了些  - 一个编辑在军队能干什么？
- You've got that bit right at least.   - What's an editor do in the army?

102
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:15,343
写希特勒的性生活然后发给报纸？
Write stories about Hitler's sex life and send 'em off to the newspapers?

103
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,618
我们让象你这样的怪才歪才工作,来赢得战争
We put corrupt and ill-assorted talents like yours to work winning the war.

104
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,158
我已要求调你来情报部
I've requested your transfer to lntelligence.

105
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,163
你怎么会这样做？
Why in hell you want to do that?

106
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:28,256
你去管理苏格兰的战俘营
You're going to run a P.O.W. camp in Scotland.

107
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,131
饶了我吧,本。我不是警察
God, Benny. I'm not a policeman.

108
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,466
去你的好记者吧！
Damn good crime reporter, though.

109
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:36,666
自从我认识你,你就是个不安分的家伙
You've been a chaotic bastard for as long as I've known you.

110
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:40,575
但你总是有不正当的天赋,把周围的事情理顺
But you have a perverse sort of genius for setting things in order around you--

111
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:43,409
只要你有心去做
when you've a mind to.

112
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,075
我现在有心去度假
I've a mind to go on a holiday at the moment.

113
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:48,881
记录里说你度过假了
Well, that review board will see that you get it.

114
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,013
杰克,我是在救你这高贵的爱尔兰蠢蛋
Jack, I'm saving your royal lrish ass for you...

115
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,493
让你有机会做适合你的工作
and giving you the chance to do the sort of job you've always been keen on doing.

116
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,496
战俘？我吐,长官
Prisoners of war? I puke, sir.

117
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:01,589
别废话了,杰克.
Now get stuffed, Jack.

118
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,635
我需要你,我非常需要你那非凡的感应力
I need you. I need your great nose to the ground.

119
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,599
麦肯齐的德军战俘,全是高级官员
The German prisoners, all top-line officers...

120
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:12,734
在过去几个月里,一直在制造麻烦
have been raising a peculiar sort of hell at McKenzie the past few months.

121
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,245
其它地方相对平静
Other camps, relative quiet.

122
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,646
麦肯齐,实际上是失控
McKenzie, veritable state of siege.

123
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:24,084
作战部和情报部都想知道他们
Both War Office and lntelligence want to find out if there's any connection...

124
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,647
是否与德国有联系
any link with the dear old Deutschland.

125
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,158
你被授全权
You have full authorization...

126
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:31,491
做任何必做之事,恢复营地的秩序
to do what you must to bring the camp around...

127
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:33,827
找出我们想知道的
and find out what we need to know.

128
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:36,423
佩里上校现负责那里
A Major Perry's in command there.

129
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,864
让上尉指挥上校管理营地？
The captain tells the major how to run his camp?

130
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,407
那让你好笑吧
I thought that would amuse you.

131
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,967
他将收到指令和情报部合作
He'll be instructed to cooperate with Military lntelligence and so on.

132
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,138
那记录怎么处理？
What about that review board?

133
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:53,412
你有办法不让那来骚扰我吗？
Have you any ideas how to keep them off my back?

134
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:58,617
我会处理的,老家伙
I shall ponder the matter, old boy.

135
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,658
能来点治痢疾
Can you give me something for diarrhea...

136
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,659
头痛或便秘的吗？
headache or constipation?

137
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,252
好的,他来了-- 佩里上校！
Yes, here he comes-- Major Perry!

138
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,466
说英语
English. English.

139
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:14,567
为什么那些孩子打斗？
Why are those boys fighting?

140
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,574
为什么校长不制止他们？
Why does that schoolmaster not stop them?

141
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:20,304
他来了--佩里上校！
Here he comes-- Major Perry!

142
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:38,554
安静...安静,还有节目
Quiet...quiet. There's more to come.

143
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:43,363
谁再吹口哨将罚款10马克
The next one who whistles will be fined 10 marks.

144
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,907
英国人都有个肥屁股
All the English have fat asses

145
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:56,606
佩里上校,考科斯军士
Major Perry, Sergeant Cox

146
00:15:56,681 --> 00:16:00,481
我们想给他们带手铐
We would like to give them handcuffs

147
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:04,318
把他们关进6英尺的箱子
Put them in a six-feet box

148
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:08,086
当战争结束
When the war is gone and finished

149
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,993
我们赢得胜利
And we win the victory

150
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:15,794
德国将会更大
Deutschland then will be much bigger

151
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:19,860
英格兰则属于你和我
England then belongs to you and me

152
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,635
当战争结束
When the war is gone and finished

153
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:27,439
我们赢得胜利
And we win the victory

154
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:31,414
德国将会更大
Deutschland then will be much bigger

155
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:35,316
英格兰则属于你和我
England then belongs to you and me

156
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:39,288
我们可留在麦肯齐战俘营
We can stay in Camp McKenzie

157
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:44,659
因为英格兰属于你和我
For England then belongs to you and me

158
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:55,768
为司令官施吕特欢呼
Three cheers for Commandant Schluetter...

159
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,864
...万岁
...hip hip, hooray.

160
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,166
这是个血腥的英国杂耍戏院
It's a bloody English music hall.

161
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:26,866
没有英国兵能有意思吗？
Is more fun in here without the English Tommies, eh?

162
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,901
你们  - 谢谢今早演出
All of you   - thanks for this morning.

163
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,450
你扮了个恶心的英国女人,施密特
You make a lousy English lady, Schmidt.

164
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,218
她太象犹太人了！
She's too Jewish looking!

165
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,394
诺伊尔,你应该参加
Neuchl, you should take the part.

166
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:54,397
你扮来一定很象英国女人
You'd make a hell of an English lady.

167
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:02,840
为何不带你的朋友伯杰到台上来
Why not bring your friend, Berger, up here to the stage...

168
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:05,808
给我们模仿两个英国女人的做派？
and do the sketch for us like two English ladies?

169
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:09,207
行吗？
Won't you?

170
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:13,781
你的地位并不是用来这样侮辱我的
Your position, Kapitan, is not so to give me such insult.

171
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,911
作为你的长官,我的地位是...
My position as your commanding officer is so...

172
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:19,616
因懦弱枪毙你
to have you killed for being a coward, if I must.

173
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,591
你不是懦夫吗？
Are you not a coward?

174
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,957
我遵守战犯规则
I obey the rules of a prisoner of war.

175
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,991
做为德国战俘营司令官...
As the German Camp Commandant...

176
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:34,164
...你知道日内瓦协议不允许煽动骚乱
...you know the Geneva Convention forbids you to incite a riot.

177
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:38,241
你是个同性恋,不是吗？
You are a homosexual, are you not?

178
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:47,817
对不起,你英语很差
Sorry. Your English is poor.

179
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,978
你是个同性恋,是不是？
You're a queer aren't you?

180
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:56,149
为何不让伯杰上台来？
Why don't you ask Berger here to the stage?

181
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:59,424
你们可拥抱接吻,来一个可爱的同性恋婚礼
You can hug and kiss and have a lovely queer wedding.

182
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,275
我会再找你的
I'll see you later.

183
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:37,424
去他的规定吧,让我们点起胜利之火
To hell with orders, let's make a victory fire.

184
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:52,348
是的,考科斯先生,烟火之夜
Quite right, Mr. Cox. Fireworks night.

185
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,112
他们在蔑视灯火管制
They're flaunting the blackout regulations, sir.

186
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:57,780
是的,庆祝48小时的处罚
Yes, celebrating my 48-hour punishment.

187
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:01,154
- 我们等着看吧  - 等着看什么？
- We'll see to that, sir.   - You'll see to what?

188
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:05,025
等着看我们又被耍了一次
You'll see to it that we're all made fools of once again.

189
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,122
你不能派人去执行灯火管制吗？
Will you move men in there to enforce blackout regulations?

190
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:12,568
等到那里,他们会都跑了,又笑话我们
Jerry will have disappeared by the time you get there, laughing at us.

191
00:20:12,637 --> 00:20:15,162
你的人会少几个头被打破的
Your men will get a few more broken heads for their pains.

192
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:18,572
这帮好斗的德国佬点火指引空袭
The bleeding krauts are lightin' up the sky askin' for a raid, sir.

193
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:23,012
在这荒凉的鸡场100英里范围内,从没有过空袭！
There's never been a raid within 100 miles of this desolate chicken farm!

194
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,480
只有警报。我是说,怎么会炸这里呢？
Only alerts. I mean, why bomb this?

195
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,749
这里人员不足、设备简陋,很平常的边区村落
This understaffed, ill-manned outpost of military mediocrities.

196
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,860
谢谢,没事的
Thank you. That'll be all.

197
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,427
安排一下从伦敦来的康纳上尉
Make transport arrangements for a Captain Connor coming up from London.

198
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,436
- 详细资料在连部  - 是,长官
- The details are in the orderly room.   - Yes, sir.

199
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,147
把棋下完怎样,霍尔先生？
Shall we finish the game, Mr. Hall?

200
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,150
随你
As you like, sir.

201
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,481
对不起
Sorry.

202
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,150
我有点过份
I went a bit too far.

203
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:15,662
真不知道英国政府怎么想的
I'm damned if I know what Whitehall expects.

204
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:20,761
"别太过份了,我们有很多人在德国战俘营里"
"Don't move too aggressively. Thousands of our chaps in German prison camps."

205
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:22,567
这我赞成
And I quite agree.

206
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,803
"但你就不能维持那里的秩序吗,佩里上校？"
"But can't you maintain order there, Major Perry?"

207
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:29,870
我要求增加兵力,他们却只派来个康纳上尉
And when I ask for troop reinforcements, they send me a single Captain Connor.

208
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:33,781
"让他处理一下这个事情",我是说,唉
"Let him have a look at the matter." I mean, oh, dear.

209
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,451
穿上这军服,你比警卫还象英国人
With those uniforms you look more British than the Guard.

210
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:46,125
没人会阻拦你出大门
No one will stop you once you are out of the gate.

211
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,581
是我们的苏格兰联络人
It's our Scottish contact.

212
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:07,777
他在格伦福伊尔大街,等霍奇鲍尔和施密特
He'll be waiting for Hochbauer and Schmidt on the Glenfoyle Road.

213
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,285
好
Good.

214
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,191
B 代表柏林和暴动
B is for Berlin and breakout.

215
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:20,921
柏林方面怎么说？
What did Berlin say?

216
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:23,966
说英语,这不是柏林
English. It wasn't Berlin.

217
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,196
是我们这里的苏格兰朋友
It was our friend here in Scotland...

218
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,261
他同意提前见你
and he agrees to an earlier meeting with you.

219
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,604
佩里要我们带手铐时,我们大闹一场
Let's raise a little hell when Perry tries to put on the handcuffs...

220
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:34,702
你可以直接出去,混进英国人中
and you can march straight off and join the British army.

221
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:42,950
我刚来时我们常在这里野炊,很棒的
We used to have picnics here when I first came. It was grand.

222
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,389
德国小伙子很孤独,很可爱
They were so lonely, the German lads, and they were so nice.

223
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:52,327
然后制定了规定,缩紧了营地
Then they made the rule, I guess. Closed the camp tight.

224
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:55,565
什么时候的事？
When was that?

225
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:58,124
有一年吧,头来的时候
About a year ago, when the headmaster came.

226
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:01,330
呃,是上校。佩里上校,是的
Uh, the Major. Major Perry, that is.

227
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:05,569
佩里上校来的时候
When Major Perry came, sir.

228
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:26,391
一帮弱不经风的家伙
You're a bunch of weaklings.

229
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:38,337
该空军的了
Now it's the Lufwaffe's turn.

230
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:44,243
早晨好,施莱特上尉
Good morning, Captain Schleutter.

231
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,408
谢谢你早晨送来了名单
Thank you for the list you sent me this morning.

232
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:49,476
但还有其他英语讲得很好的
But there are others of us who speak excellent English.

233
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:51,551
你英语很好,克兰兹
Your English is excellent, Kranz.

234
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,756
地道在你来前就开始挖了
The tunnel was begun before you came here.

235
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:58,090
名单上要逃离的人28人,都是潜艇上的人
Your list, the 28 men who are to escape, are all U-boat men.

236
00:23:58,162 --> 00:24:00,687
没我的人,也没有昂格尔的技师
None of my men. None of Unger's engineers.

237
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:07,500
我掌控地道,是受命于希特勒和邓尼茨
I took the tunnel over on orders from Hitler and Doenitz.

238
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:16,138
是为了让有技术的潜艇人员返回战争
In order to get skilled U-boat men back into the war.

239
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:18,044
德国现在需要他们
Germany must have them now.

240
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,409
我明白,但我的人需要些解释
I understand, but my men want some explanation.

241
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:24,580
你是空军司令官,你解释命令吗？
You're a Luftwaffe Commandant. Do you explain orders?

242
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:28,682
我要你解释为何那样对待诺伊尔
I want some explanation about the way you treated Neuchl.

243
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:35,124
那个仙女,他是个德国孬种
That flying fairy, Hauptman, he's a bad German.

244
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:49,605
是的,我在爱尔兰度过一两个很惬意的假
Yes, I've spent a very decent holiday or two in lreland.

245
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,514
为什么中止了战俘在外活动的待遇？
What made you decide to suspend the outside privileges for the Germans?

246
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:57,577
我觉得我前任对制度太随意了
I felt that my predecessor had taken too many liberties with regulations.

247
00:24:58,522 --> 00:25:00,922
事实上,冯・威斯托芬和我协议--
As a matter of fact, Von Westhofen agreed with me--

248
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:05,052
是营中官衔最高的,直到他4月份死去
the German senior officer in the camp until his death last April.

249
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,893
好老头,冯・威斯托芬将军
Nice old boy, General Von Westhofen.

250
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,762
很爱看书
A great feeling for books.

251
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,298
现在是个年轻的魔鬼负责,你听说过施莱特吗？
Complete opposite of the young devil now in command. You've heard of Schleutter?

252
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,499
听说过。那老头怎么死的？
Yes. What did the nice old boy die of?

253
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:19,543
- 自然死亡？  - 心脏病发作
- A natural death?   - Heart attack.

254
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:31,478
早安
Morning.

255
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:35,047
康纳上尉是伦敦派来的
Captain Connor's been sent up from London.

256
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:38,789
他来协助我分析这里的情况
He's to assist me in analyzing the problems here.

257
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:52,968
48小时的处罚什么时候结束？
When are you goin' to lift your 48-hour siege, sir?

258
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:54,977
明早起床号时
Tomorrow morning at reveille.

259
00:25:57,715 --> 00:26:01,116
- 我们进去看看  - 不要,上尉
- Let's have a look inside then.   - I think not, Captain.

260
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,517
会减弱处罚的效果
It would weaken the effect of the punishment.

261
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:05,521
我要四处看看
I should have a look around.

262
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:10,155
上尉,昨天在那里有12个人受重伤
Captain, 12 men were seriously injured in there yesterday.

263
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:12,559
若你进去,是你的责任
If you go in, it's your responsibility.

264
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,154
好的
Yes, sir.

265
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:17,866
- 那电话通所有岗楼吗？  - 是的长官
- Does that phone go to all the towers?   - Yes, sir.

266
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,527
对不起
Excuse me.

267
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:28,678
我是康纳上尉
This is Captain Connor speaking.

268
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,607
我要进去了
I'm comin' inside now.

269
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,149
你也来好吗,考科斯先生？
Will you come along, Mr. Cox?

270
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:48,693
增援  - 一个新人！
Reinforcements   - one more man!

271
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,971
看来我们来客了
Looks like we have company.

272
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:49,458
你认为冯・威斯托芬是怎么死的,考科斯先生？
What do you suppose Von Westhofen died of, Mr. Cox?

273
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:52,427
就象佩里上校所说,先生
I expect it was as Major Perry said, sir.

274
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:54,623
我想知道你的看法
I'd like your opinion on that.

275
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:57,633
我看他一直很健康
Well, he always seemed in the best of health to me, sir.

276
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:03,237
你认为施莱特除掉了他？
You think Schleutter got rid of him?

277
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,333
那狗娘养的控制了这里,我就知道这些
The bastard has control now. That's all I know.

278
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:13,942
- 有人逃走过吗？  - 有几个
- Have you had any escapes?   - A few.

279
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:17,181
大多数在妓院被抓回来
Most of them get picked up in the local whorehouse.

280
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:21,021
有两人成功地逃到了爱尔兰自由州
A couple did make it across to the lrish Free State.

281
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:24,959
你是说地狱吧,去了可怕的地方
Hell, you say. Horrible place to wind up.

282
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:27,821
只有一个办法对付战犯
There's only one way to handle prisoners, sir.

283
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:30,894
把他们关进足够小的的地方
Lock 'em up someplace so tight...

284
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:34,301
使他们只能吃、睡和拉屎
that all they can do is eat, sleep and shit.

285
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,840
但日内瓦协议不容许
But the Geneva Convention wouldn't abide it.

286
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:54,991
他们有工场吗？
Do they have any workshops?

287
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:58,358
他们可以制造出你说的任何东西
They can make almost anything you care to name.

288
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,796
把他们军官的军服搞得象新的一样
Made uniforms as good as new for their top officers.

289
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,767
他们有焊锅匠、裁缝
They've got the lot: tinkers, tailors.

290
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:09,328
- 造烛台的,我不奇怪  - 他们造过枪吗？
-Candlestick makers, I shouldn't wonder. -Did they make any guns yet?

291
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:13,308
我们搜过,突然搜查,什么也没找到
We search, we try to surprise them. We find nothing.

292
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,575
好象我们总是在诧异
It turns out we always get the surprises.

293
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:20,048
- 那是施莱特吗？  - 是,一号房
- Is that Schleutter?   - Ay, number one barracks.

294
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:22,449
肯定
To be sure.

295
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:31,484
"沉默的威利"
"Quiet Willi."

296
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,725
而他的人并不沉默,是他负责
His men aren't so quiet, though. He's seen to that.

297
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,461
他得到了比在潜艇上更大的权力.
He's got more authority here than he ever had on a U-boat.

298
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:42,062
我昨天听说了他在军事演习中的表现
I heard about his playin' at war games yesterday.

299
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:45,074
- 很刺激,是不是？  - 太对了,长官
- Exciting, was it?   - You're dead right, sir.

300
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:48,578
那里是食堂。拐角处是冷却器
That's the mess hall up there. Around the corner is the cooler.

301
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:51,512
上校还没充分利用它
The Major hasn't made enough use of it yet, sir.

302
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:59,055
有这帮人你烦不烦？
Are you irritated by this lot?

303
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:02,217
- 没他们更好,长官  - 那就走快点
- I could do without them, sir.   - Quick march, then.

304
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:44,596
表层土很好,威利
That's lovely topsoil, Willi.

305
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,164
对你的萝卜视察满意吗,上尉？
Were you satisfied with your turnip inspection, Captain?

306
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:53,209
很满意
Just grand.

307
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:55,541
你把地道的土放在那里,是不是？
You're not puttin' the dirt from your tunnel there, are you?

308
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:59,980
地道？你过时了,上尉
Tunnel? You're old-fashioned, Captain.

309
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,610
没错
That's right.

310
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,120
是的,肯定有比地道更好的办法
Yes, there must be a better way than that.

311
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:18,401
请注意
Attention, please.

312
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:20,403
我是佩里上校
This is Major Perry.

313
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:25,470
我指派康纳上尉负责明天的点名
I am assigning Captain Connor officer in charge of roll call tomorrow morning.

314
00:31:26,543 --> 00:31:29,944
他将监督挑选和上手铐
He will supervise the selection and handcuffing...

315
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,642
点名后25名军官带手铐
of 25 German officers immediately after roll call.

316
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:35,480
谢谢
Thank you.

317
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,691
该有更好的办法
There must be a better way.

318
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:00,974
我们把这入口与2号房隔开
We keep this entrance from N.2. barracks clear...

319
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,705
因为这是主要的逃跑入口
...since it is the main escape hatch.

320
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:05,438
若你跟我去3号
If you will follow me to No.3.

321
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,083
就能看到顶层
You can inspect the Attic there.

322
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:24,161
过厕所时小心
Careful climbing through the latrine closet.

323
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,032
到顶层才有光
There is no light until the Attic.

324
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,946
我计算过天花板的负荷
I have calculated the load on the ceiling.

325
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,053
我们有1千7百立方厘米的垃圾
We have 17,000 cubic centimeters of dirt.

326
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:51,186
我用绳索来固定
I've installed cable supports...

327
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:55,288
粗糙但有效
...crude but effective.

328
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,215
在预计时间内很难完成
It's difficult with the advanced schedule.

329
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:21,718
在逃跑的人中没有激励机制
We don't have the incentive of being among those to escape.

330
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,926
当然,解决这个问题要给我足够的奖励
Of course solving the problem is incentive enough for me.

331
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:33,730
我是工程师
I am an engineer.

332
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:36,530
做个效率高的工程师,昂格尔
Be a fast engineer, Unger.

333
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:01,960
我们距篱笆5米
We are five meters from the fence...

334
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:05,459
距河流26米
...and 26 meters from the stream.

335
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:13,137
我们要用2号房的房顶空间
We will have to use the roof space in Barracks 2.

336
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:16,946
3号房就要装满了
Barracks 3 will soon be filled.

337
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:22,113
- 早晨好,考科斯先生  - 早晨好,长官
- Good evening, Mr. Cox.   - Good evening, sir.

338
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,643
- 你下令6点吹起床号  - 是的
- You ordered reveille at 0600 hours.   - That's right.

339
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:28,418
C连25人带手铐
And C Company to fall out with 25 handcuffs.

340
00:34:28,492 --> 00:34:30,483
对
Right.

341
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,222
叫消防队,好吗？
And call the fire brigade, will you?

342
00:34:33,296 --> 00:34:35,230
- 消防队  - 长官
- Fire brigade.   - Sir.

343
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,818
把他们从前两个等级分开
Divide them between the front two ranks.

344
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,821
每级别两个
Two to each rank.

345
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,234
半面左转
Half left, wheel.

346
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:55,411
右转！
Right wheel!

347
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,881
我是康纳上尉
This is Captain Connor speaking.

348
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,615
所有犯人听着：要立即点名
To all prisoners: There'll be immediate roll call.

349
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:11,621
重复：立即点名,25人要带手铐
I repeat: There'll be an immediate roll call and 25 men will be handcuffed.

350
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:17,731
按计划进入营地
Enter the barracks as previously instructed.

351
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:19,360
行动！
Move!

352
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:44,551
没人,长官。空的
Nobody here, sir. Dead empty. Mother Hubbard.

353
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:46,095
这里也是,长官
Same here, sir.

354
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:50,057
小心检查
Proceed with caution.

355
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:55,402
6人去2号,跑步！
Six men to hut two. On the double!

356
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:13,020
快进去
Move in quickly.

357
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,037
回来！
Get back!

358
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,736
不要太认真了
You don't have to make it look this realistic.

359
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,114
放松点,你不必杀我的
Take it easy, you don't have to kill me.

360
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:45,916
你们两个！
Hey, you two men!

361
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,047
回来！
Get back!

362
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:50,659
好,去那里,混进英国人里
Good, now get in there and mix with the British.

363
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:55,927
德国佬上钩了
Jerry's taking the bait.

364
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:11,406
注意,这猪叫了消防队
Watch out, the swines have called the Fire Brigade.

365
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:12,941
快
Hurry.

366
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,623
考科斯,打开！
Mr. Cox, turn it on!

367
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,008
该空军出来了,带诺伊尔来
It's time for the Luftwaffe. Get Neuchl.

368
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:50,677
4人跟我来
Four men with me.

369
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,129
抓住那人！
Get that man!

370
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,648
铐上那狗娘养的
Handcuff the bastards.

371
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,432
考科斯,行了
Mr. Cox, that'll do.

372
00:42:35,745 --> 00:42:37,007
关了！
Off!

373
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:46,411
看来你赢了手铐的争执,上尉
You seem to have won an argument over handcuffs, Captain.

374
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,420
你都湿透了,威利
And you got all wet, Willi.

375
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:53,189
让你的人1小时后点名
Have your men out in one hour for roll call.

376
00:42:54,464 --> 00:42:58,025
我坚持立刻去医院
I insist on visiting your infirmary immediately...

377
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:00,069
看看我的人的情况
to see to the condition of my men.

378
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,403
点名后才行,威利
Right after the roll call, Willi.

379
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:32,530
- 说英语  - 好的
- And speak English.   - Okay.

380
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:36,231
我也很高兴出来。但我们必须找到在凯思尼斯的朋友
I'm glad to be out too. But we have to find our chum in Cathness.

381
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,274
他在说什么？
What the hell is he sayin'?

382
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:47,315
我想他是昏迷了,长官
I think he's unconscious, sir.

383
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:53,178
他醒后我要和他讲话
When he comes around I want to talk to him.

384
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,315
- 不惜代价  - 我尽力
- Do whatever you have to.   - Do my best.

385
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:03,098
那人状况很差,我们的人没必要那么过份
That man's in a very bad way. Our chaps didn't have to go that far.

386
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,259
不是我们的人打的
It wasn't them that did it to him.

387
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:08,133
是他们自己人,几乎杀了他
It was his own lot. Damn near killed him.

388
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:12,073
或许出于私人恩怨
Working off some private grudge, perhaps.

389
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:13,870
长官,刚收到的
Sir, this just came.

390
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:18,437
派一个人守着他,不要让任何人接近他
Keep a close guard on him, Sergeant. I don't want anyone near him.

391
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,004
- 康纳上尉  - 长官
- Captain Connor.   - Sir.

392
00:44:23,686 --> 00:44:25,620
德国人不再铐我们的人了
The Germans have taken the handcuffs off our men.

393
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:29,089
- 是的,我知道了  - 你知道？
- Yes, I knew about that.   - You knew?

394
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:31,922
离开伦敦前就知道了
I knew before I left London.

395
00:44:31,995 --> 00:44:33,929
那些人的手铐要立即拿掉
Then those men must be unshackled at once.

396
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:35,988
不急,长官
Not just yet, sir.

397
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,796
上尉,我受命与你合作,并不是放弃指挥权
Captain, I'm instructed to cooperate with you, not relinquish my command.

398
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,804
不是,长官
Not at all, sir.

399
00:44:42,872 --> 00:44:46,774
但你必须按情报部的要求做
But you see, you must comply with what the lntelligence mission requires.

400
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:50,711
何况我来这里并非只为解决暴乱问题
And I didn't come here just to put down a riot.

401
00:44:52,282 --> 00:44:55,183
你在正式要求我违犯日内瓦协议？
Are you formally requesting me to contravene the Geneva Convention?

402
00:44:56,386 --> 00:44:58,445
只是几个小时
For a few hours is all.

403
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:00,614
好吧,康纳上尉
Very well, Captain Connor.

404
00:45:01,691 --> 00:45:04,353
我相信今日之事对你极有好处
I'm sure today's episode can only redound to your credit.

405
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:06,651
长官
Sir.

406
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,536
我要一个所有受伤人员的名单
I want a complete list of the numbers and injuries to our men.

407
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,649
现场80人,无误,长官
Eighty present and correct, sir.

408
00:45:34,724 --> 00:45:36,885
继续,军士
Carry on, Sergeant.

409
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:07,880
长官,4队检查完毕,全部在场,点名完毕
Sir, checked parade four. All present and accounted for.

410
00:46:07,957 --> 00:46:10,255
解散！
Parade, dismiss!

411
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,275
我有许可去看望我的人
I have permission to check on the condition of my men.

412
00:46:28,344 --> 00:46:30,608
请进
Yes, sir. Go inside, please.

413
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:34,278
这此看起来象刀伤
These look like knife cuts.

414
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,784
他失去很多血,把他放床上
He lost a lot of blood. Put him to bed.

415
00:46:51,334 --> 00:46:52,266
诺伊尔呢？
Where's Neuchl?

416
00:46:52,802 --> 00:46:54,030
在那小房间里
In that little room.

417
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,434
- 音乐让你烦吗,长官？  - 没有
- Does the music bother you, sir?   - Not at all.

418
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:05,004
是为了治疗,长官。德国人喜欢这类
It's a therapy, of course, sir. Germans are fond of this kind of thing.

419
00:47:05,081 --> 00:47:07,515
我一直在收集古典音乐,因为--
I've always collected classical music because--

420
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:15,748
你有医用白兰地吗？
Have you any of that medical brandy?

421
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:17,417
有,长官
Y es, sir.

422
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:21,889
喝一杯吗,上尉？
Will you have a drink, Captain?

423
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,024
为什么不让我看一个我的人？
Do I understand you refuse me the right to see one of my men?

424
00:47:26,836 --> 00:47:29,930
- 一杯白兰地,下士  - 是,长官
- Just the one brandy, Corporal, please.   - Y es, sir.

425
00:47:30,006 --> 00:47:33,271
他并不急于见你的
Well, he doesn't seem to be too anxious to see you.

426
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,371
他逃离了你的那帮畜生,对不？
He got away from those brutes of yours, didn't he?

427
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:41,307
他们几乎杀了他
They nearly killed him.

428
00:47:41,384 --> 00:47:43,682
他由首席外科医生看护
He's under the care of the chief surgeon.

429
00:47:46,722 --> 00:47:49,282
你这爱尔兰人真是不可思议,上尉
You lrish are just fabulous, Captain.

430
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:53,954
你真是继承了著名的爱尔兰想象力
You really have got that famous lrish imagination.

431
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,989
但你今早的水造成了如此混乱
But your water sports this morning made such a confusion.

432
00:47:58,067 --> 00:48:00,001
谁知道你看见了什么？
Who knows what you saw?

433
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:04,368
看见了什么我知道,我看见一个人逃跑
I know what I saw. I saw a man tryin' to escape.

434
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,665
不是我和你唱反调,上尉
I'm not contradicting you really, Captain.

435
00:48:07,743 --> 00:48:11,110
你或许看见企图逃跑
You may have seen an attempted escape.

436
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,341
哪个犯人不想逃跑？
Is it not the duty of all prisoners to try?

437
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,815
- 长官  - 谢谢,下士
- Sir.   - Thank you, Corporal.

438
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:24,892
托斯卡尼尼？
Toscanini?

439
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:29,329
富特旺勒更棒
Furtwangler does it better.

440
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:44,175
顺便说一下,德国营已经取消了英国战俘的手铐
By the way, the German camps have taken the shackles off the British prisoners.

441
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:46,841
我们会很快做出回应
And we shall reciprocate very soon.

442
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,784
当然,你的人造成了不小的破坏
Of course, your lads did quite a bit of damage.

443
00:48:56,859 --> 00:48:59,555
我们将从他们工资里扣
We'll have to deduct that from their pay.

444
00:48:59,695 --> 00:49:02,357
眼下就没事了,上尉
And that will be all for now, Captain.

445
00:49:02,431 --> 00:49:05,195
你可去看你的人
You'll want to see your men.

446
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:09,568
上尉,扣我的工资补偿损失
And Captain, deduct the damages from my pay.

447
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:12,631
- 谢谢  - 你做的已经够多了
- Thank you.   - You've done too much as it is.

448
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:28,315
看着那个人,让他尽快离开
Keep your eye on that one. See that he leaves soon.

449
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:31,792
没我同意不许任何人进去
And don't let anyone else in without my authorization.

450
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:41,670
在这里
There they are.

451
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:45,332
把这些书带给犯人,我检查过了
Take these books to the prisoners. I've inspected them.

452
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:51,579
这些都是水手的吗？
This is all the Kriegsmariners?

453
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:54,047
是的,我分捡出来的
Y es. I separated them.

454
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,051
我看不懂德文
I don't read German all that well.

455
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,110
我甚至不知道我在找什么
I don't even know what the hell I'm lookin' for.

456
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:02,123
- 那是什么？  - 永恒
- What's that?   - Ewigkeit.

457
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:07,728
"亲爱的妻子,象是已经隔了很久
"My dear wife, it has seemed like an eternity...

458
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:10,766
自从我上次亲你的胸部
since last I kissed your bosom...

459
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:13,267
and slept with my arms entwined...
让你睡在我的怀里

460
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:15,930
around your body."
抱着你的玉体

461
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:18,439
你一整天都在读这种情书？
You read these horny letters all day?

462
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:21,101
- 这是邮局的职责  - 是吗？
- That's the function of the post office.   - lt is?

463
00:50:23,212 --> 00:50:25,703
"萝卜长得很好,亲爱的
"The turnip fields are growing, dear...

464
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:30,275
我们还要排练几部莎士比亚的戏.
and we are going to do several plays by Shakespeare.

465
00:50:30,353 --> 00:50:35,256
真希望你在我身边,能拥抱你,抚摸你的胸部"
I wish I had you with me now to put my arms around and feel your bosom."

466
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,622
胸部,胸部,胸部
Bosom, bosom, bosom.

467
00:50:37,693 --> 00:50:40,662
为什么他们在日期前放罗马数字？
Why do they put that Roman numeral in the date?

468
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,029
- 什么日期？  - 有罗马数字的日期
- What date?   - The date has a Roman numeral in it.

469
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,001
- 你注意到过吗？  - 以前从没注意过
- You ever notice that?   - I never noticed that before.

470
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:51,334
有个怪怪的小7
He's got that queer little German seven...

471
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:55,844
还有1和2,但用罗马数字开头
and the one and the two, but it starts off with a Roman numeral.

472
00:50:56,946 --> 00:51:00,814
就要有个伦敦的破译人员来这里
We're gonna get us a code man down here from London...

473
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:03,477
让他看看这些情书
and have him take a look at these horny letters.

474
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:20,600
回床上去！听到没有？
Get back to bed! Do you hear me?

475
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:53,192
注意！他们有个人质！马上回到床上去！
Look out! They've got a hostage! Get back to your beds immediately!

476
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,292
我让你久等了吗,威利？
Have I kept you waitin', Willi?

477
00:52:23,365 --> 00:52:26,892
这是你的监狱,上尉。我们听你的命令行事
It's your prison, Captain. We follow your orders.

478
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:30,769
你下达了你的命令,没有吗？
You have imposed your kind of order, haven't you?

479
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,308
- 你和他熟吗？  - 不
- Did you know him well?   - No.

480
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,434
他叫什么名字？你知道的
What's his name? You know that.

481
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:37,536
鲁珀特・诺伊尔
Rupert Neuchl.

482
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,138
在你们的医院记录中有
You have it on your hospital report.

483
00:52:40,216 --> 00:52:43,481
我是说,他在日间肯定苏醒过的
I mean, he must have regained consciousness during the day.

484
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:45,884
他上吊死了
He hanged himself.

485
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:48,890
你要那样通知他家人,还是我来？
Do you want to write that to his family, or should I do it?

486
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,688
那没必要
It won't be necessary.

487
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:54,525
- 他为何上吊？  - 他懦弱
- Why'd he hang himself?   - He was weak.

488
00:52:54,597 --> 00:52:57,259
他是同性恋。为何问我？
He was a homosexual. Why do you ask me?

489
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:01,292
我们问了病房中所有的人,当然他们什么也没看见
We asked everyone else in the ward. They didn't see anything, of course.

490
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:04,362
你是负责人,他为什么要死？
You're the commanding officer. Why'd he die?

491
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,374
上尉,他死在你的监禁中
Captain, he died under your custody.

492
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:13,111
我想我闻到了白兰地
I smell cognac, I think.

493
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:16,282
我想你是闻到了爱尔兰威士忌
You smell lrish whiskey, I think.

494
00:53:16,352 --> 00:53:18,786
- 给你  - 谢谢
- There you are.   - Thank you.

495
00:53:31,767 --> 00:53:34,531
很遗憾,尸体总不能与守灵人同乐
It's a pity the corpse never enjoys the wake.

496
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,667
在黄泉路上也有个好人聊天
A hell of a nice fellow to talk to, though.

497
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:40,208
你喝点,鲁珀特
Here's to you, Rupert.

498
00:53:43,912 --> 00:53:47,643
你的德语-- 你今天发音很好
Your German-- you're pronouncing it very good today.

499
00:53:47,716 --> 00:53:51,311
你的英语发音也很好
You're pronouncin' your English very good too.

500
00:53:51,386 --> 00:53:53,479
你在哪里学的英语,威利？
Where'd you learn English, Willi?

501
00:53:53,555 --> 00:53:56,183
不莱梅启动学院,10年了
Bremen UnterZeeboot Academie, ten years ago.

502
00:53:57,259 --> 00:53:59,557
- 你多大？  - 27岁
- How old are you?   - Twenty-seven.

503
00:54:01,430 --> 00:54:05,992
那你就有幸在希特勒冲锋队干几年了
You must've had a couple of years in the Hitler Youth Camp then, with some luck.

504
00:54:07,102 --> 00:54:09,127
很幸运
A lot of luck.

505
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:11,138
2年
Two years.

506
00:54:12,841 --> 00:54:14,775
你呢？
And you?

507
00:54:14,843 --> 00:54:16,401
我什么？
Me what?

508
00:54:16,478 --> 00:54:20,574
- 多大？  - 44岁
- I mean, how old?   - I'm 44.

509
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:25,182
- 还很健康  - 我很好,谢谢
- Still very much alive.   - I'm quite well, thanks.

510
00:54:25,253 --> 00:54:27,448
你这新官给人印象深刻
I mean, your new command is very much impressed.

511
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:30,457
有个卫兵今天告诉我
One of those nice elderly British guards told me today...

512
00:54:30,525 --> 00:54:32,459
你是个惹麻烦的记者
you were a hell of a journalist.

513
00:54:32,527 --> 00:54:36,657
没错,我是个惹麻烦的记者。我可让你出名,威利
That's true. I'm a hell of a journalist. I could make you famous, Willi.

514
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:39,758
那为不告诉我这老不死的记者,这人为何而死呢？
Now why don't you tell the lively old crime reporter why the man's dead?

515
00:54:42,537 --> 00:54:45,563
你想让我说我杀了他,为什么？
You expect me to tell you that I killed him, and why?

516
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:49,543
不,不必你做
No, you don't have to.

517
00:54:49,611 --> 00:54:51,602
我可看出你乐于杀人
I can see your pleasure in the kill.

518
00:54:54,049 --> 00:54:55,983
是吗？
Can you?

519
00:54:59,221 --> 00:55:03,089
或许你可看见一个相信胜利
Perhaps you can see somebody who believes in the war...

520
00:55:03,158 --> 00:55:06,594
相信他的人民和上司的人
who believes in his people, his leaders.

521
00:55:06,661 --> 00:55:09,289
我们为此而在战争中杀戮,是不？
We kill in a war for those things, huh?

522
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:12,457
或许你不是
But maybe you don't.

523
00:55:12,534 --> 00:55:17,335
我是说,你作为一个爱尔兰人,却在英国军队当上尉
I mean, you're lrish and you're a captain in the British army.

524
00:55:17,406 --> 00:55:22,070
这只英国军队已经杀你爱尔兰同胞几个世纪
That same British army that has killed your own lrish people for centuries.

525
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:24,578
你到底信仰什么？听谁的命令？
What do you really believe in? What kind of order?

526
00:55:24,646 --> 00:55:26,580
信谁的法律？
What laws do you obey?

527
00:55:29,384 --> 00:55:33,286
嗯,我只服从不得不服从的法律
Well, I obey as few laws as I have to.

528
00:55:33,355 --> 00:55:36,791
我也不是个循规蹈矩的人
And I'm not much of a one for order.

529
00:55:38,093 --> 00:55:41,324
我想是顺其自然吧
It has to be, I suppose...

530
00:55:41,396 --> 00:55:44,832
但规矩就是规矩,是不是？
but there's order and then there's order, isn't there?

531
00:55:46,568 --> 00:55:50,004
死也是一种规矩,对不？
Death is a kind of order, isn't it?

532
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,575
我是说,诺伊尔,他现在很守规矩
I mean, Neuchl there, he's all in order now.

533
00:55:56,244 --> 00:55:59,771
但是威利,你的人很不地道
But, Willi, that's an awful lot of shit about your people.

534
00:55:59,848 --> 00:56:02,612
就我所知,你杀了2个人
You've killed two of them that I know of.

535
00:56:03,752 --> 00:56:05,185
那不对
That's not true.

536
00:56:05,253 --> 00:56:08,313
你杀了他,可能也杀了你的上司
You killed him and you probably killed your commanding officer as well.

537
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:11,223
我看你要为此受铰刑
And for that I'm goin' to see you hang.

538
00:56:15,897 --> 00:56:17,831
你也乐于杀人吧？
You enjoy killing too, huh?

539
00:56:22,437 --> 00:56:25,964
- 考科斯先生  - 不是吗,康纳上尉？
- Mr. Cox.   - Do you not, Captain Connor?

540
00:56:27,742 --> 00:56:31,473
护送上尉去营地
See that the Captain's escorted back to his quarters, if you please.

541
00:56:57,005 --> 00:56:58,939
开门！
Gate, gentlemen!

542
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:20,293
康纳想让我以为诺伊尔跟他说了什么
Connor wants me to think that Neuchl told him something.

543
00:57:20,562 --> 00:57:22,530
我想没什么,但说不准
I don't think it was much. I'm not sure.

544
00:57:23,164 --> 00:57:25,928
康纳用德语对我说 '28水手'
'28 Submariners' Connor said to me in German.

545
00:57:26,001 --> 00:57:26,831
上帝！
My God!

546
00:57:29,304 --> 00:57:31,898
他现在也没招
He will do nothing for the moment.

547
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,637
但他会证明我杀了诺伊尔
But he'll try to prove I killed Neuchl.

548
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,074
我们要提前
Meanwhile we go ahead of schedule.

549
00:57:39,447 --> 00:57:41,438
霍奇鲍尔和施密特星期五才回来
Hochbauer and Schmidt won't be back until Friday.

550
00:57:41,516 --> 00:57:44,747
地道5天内挖不到小河
The tunnel won't reach the stream for five days.

551
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:50,815
告诉昂格尔不挖到小河
Tell Unger not to go to the stream.

552
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:54,524
转向警卫房下面
Divert and go under the Guard house.

553
00:57:57,499 --> 00:57:59,865
那短多了
It's much shorter.

554
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:03,200
别让人知道
Don't let the men know it.

555
00:58:04,306 --> 00:58:05,603
要提前
Go ahead of schedule.

556
00:58:29,931 --> 00:58:31,865
是我们的联络人
That's our contact.

557
00:58:34,069 --> 00:58:36,003
坐顺路车吗？
Can I give you boys a lift?

558
00:58:36,071 --> 00:58:38,699
他们写些什么,中尉？
What are they writing home about, Lieutenant?

559
00:58:38,773 --> 00:58:40,206
我还不知道
I can't really tell yet.

560
00:58:40,275 --> 00:58:43,938
象是机器码,如你所见--
It's a question of assembling the basic code pattern. As you see--

561
00:58:44,012 --> 00:58:46,776
- 什么时候能好？  - 很难说
- When will you know anything?   - Hard to say.

562
00:58:46,848 --> 00:58:49,282
一天,若有变异,也许要一周
Could be a day, could be a week if there are variations.

563
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:53,447
但我们不必靠破译知道有麻烦
But we don't have to wait for a decoded message to know that we have trouble.

564
00:58:53,521 --> 00:58:56,251
显然是施莱特策划的
Obviously Schleutter's at the center of it.

565
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,258
我们要把他移去布莱克浦
We must transfer him to Blackpool.

566
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,955
- 我需要他再呆这里一段时间  - 你需要他？
- I need him here a bit longer.   - You need him?

567
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:06,626
他策划的,但策划的什么？若他去布莱克浦,我就查不出来了
He's at the center, but of what? I can't find out if he's in Blackpool.

568
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:22,054
你必须尽快阻塞旧地道
You must block the old tunnel and be as quick as you can with this one.

569
00:59:26,864 --> 00:59:29,264
讨厌的事,但必须做
Lousy work but necessary.

570
01:01:50,374 --> 01:01:53,241
你在营地遇到麻烦吗,考科斯？
Have you met any resistance in the barracks, Mr. Cox?

571
01:01:54,545 --> 01:01:55,876
没有？好
Nothing? Good.

572
01:01:55,947 --> 01:01:59,110
不管发生任何事都,要直接通知我
Well, inform me directly if anything at all happens.

573
01:01:59,183 --> 01:02:01,014
是。谢谢,上校
Y es. Thank you, Sergeant Major.

574
01:02:01,085 --> 01:02:05,283
进来,康纳上尉。我想你应该知道我们在干什么
Come in, Captain Connor. I think you ought to know we're onto something.

575
01:02:05,356 --> 01:02:07,290
谢谢
Thank you.

576
01:02:07,358 --> 01:02:11,351
象是有28个水手想逃跑
It appears that 28 submariners are due to escape.

577
01:02:11,429 --> 01:02:13,329
有艘潜艇来接他们
There's a U-boat coming to pick them up.

578
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:16,833
"可用U-841。派28人。地点,时间同意"
"U-841 available. Assign 28 men. Location, date agreeable."

579
01:02:16,901 --> 01:02:20,098
- 地点时间呢？  - 我们查了所有的信
- What's the location and date?   - We checked all the letters.

580
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:23,834
约定的时间肯定在以前收到的东西里
Specific time must've been set before in something they received earlier.

581
01:02:23,908 --> 01:02:26,843
没关系,我们现在就进去阻止他们
It doesn't matter. We'll move in now and break it up.

582
01:02:26,911 --> 01:02:30,904
肯定有地道,宁可拆除所有房子也要找到它
There's got to be a tunnel. We'll pull every barracks apart until we find it.

583
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:35,908
中尉,请出去一会好吗？
Lieutenant, could you excuse us a minute, please?

584
01:02:35,987 --> 01:02:39,445
去喝杯咖啡之类的
Go and have a cup of coffee or something.

585
01:02:52,236 --> 01:02:54,602
让他们走怎么样？
What if we were to let 'em go?

586
01:02:54,672 --> 01:02:59,166
这样,我们可跟踪找到集合点和潜艇
Then we could follow and find out where the rendezvous is and land the sub.

587
01:02:59,243 --> 01:03:01,803
威利会喜欢吗？
How'd Willi like that?

588
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,244
准许逃跑？
Permit the escape?

589
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:07,314
地道出口肯定在围墙50码之内
The tunnel's got to come up within 50 yards of that fence.

590
01:03:07,385 --> 01:03:11,412
我们只要派出巡逻,看他们从哪里出来
All we have to do is put patrols out there, see where they come through.

591
01:03:12,423 --> 01:03:14,357
我们保持无线电联系
We keep radio contact.

592
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:19,928
然后通知军队和地方警察,一直布置到海岸
Then we inform the military and civilian police all the way out to the coast.

593
01:03:21,198 --> 01:03:24,429
最后抢夺潜艇,抓住犯人
Then we nab the sub and the whole lot.

594
01:03:24,502 --> 01:03:28,097
我的职责是管理战俘营,负责里面的战俘
My job is to run this camp and account for the prisoners in it.

595
01:03:28,172 --> 01:03:31,471
奇怪的是,那并不包括允许28人逃走
And curiously enough that doesn't include letting 28 of them escape...

596
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:34,272
来延长你的军队生涯,上尉
to further your military career, Captain.

597
01:03:36,747 --> 01:03:39,944
现在,我们的人正在按我的命令搜索德国监舍
Under my instructions at this moment, our men are searching German barracks.

598
01:03:41,452 --> 01:03:44,444
- 佩里  - 是佩里上校,上尉！
- Perry.   - It's Major Perry, Captain!

599
01:03:44,522 --> 01:03:46,990
我是你的上级,你应该尊重官衔
I'm your superior officer and you will respect the rank.

600
01:03:47,058 --> 01:03:50,391
我才不管你什么官衔,或任何人的
I don't give a damn about your bloody rank, or anyone else's.

601
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:52,986
我被派来是执行任务
I got sent up here to do a job.

602
01:03:53,064 --> 01:03:55,999
我要查出暴乱背后的阴谋
I'm supposed to find out what's behind that break.

603
01:03:56,067 --> 01:03:59,798
若你不赞成我的作法,就打电话给克尔将军中止我的工作
If you don't like what I'm doing, call General Kerr and have him relieve me.

604
01:04:02,873 --> 01:04:05,307
把人叫回来,停止搜索
Now bring the men back and stop that search.

605
01:04:07,478 --> 01:04:10,743
作战部给了你特权
The War Office has given you a unique authority here.

606
01:04:11,882 --> 01:04:14,476
我想我必须服从
I suppose I must yield to it.

607
01:04:14,552 --> 01:04:17,487
尽管我相信你是错的,并且你是个自负的傻瓜
Even though I believe you to be mistaken and an arrogant fool.

608
01:04:20,424 --> 01:04:22,984
我来下命令,上尉
I'll give the order, Captain.

609
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,654
然后给伦敦打电话,让他们调走我们之一
Then I'll phone London and have them remove one of us...

610
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,789
避开这难以忍受的状况
from this intolerable situation.

611
01:04:45,116 --> 01:04:48,051
搜索取消了,东西放回
Search has been called off. Everything back.

612
01:04:49,787 --> 01:04:52,119
为什么放弃搜索,上尉？
Why give up the search, Captain?

613
01:04:52,189 --> 01:04:56,387
长官！有件东西你该看看
Sir! There's something in here you ought to see, sir.

614
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:08,534
说这人一直在生病,长官
And this one's just been sick, sir.

615
01:05:12,109 --> 01:05:14,669
卡什曼,我们要点名
Mr. Cashman, we'll have a roll call.

616
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:17,009
是,长官。继续,军士
Yes, sir. Carry on, Sergeant.

617
01:05:19,717 --> 01:05:22,447
- 他们走了多久了  - 谁？
- How long have they been away with--   - Who?

618
01:05:24,255 --> 01:05:26,314
给我这两个逃犯的名字
I want the names of these two that escaped.

619
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:28,449
对不起,我不认识他们
Sorry. I didn't know them personally.

620
01:05:32,830 --> 01:05:35,094
封锁营地,等待命令
Seal off the barracks until further orders.

621
01:05:40,071 --> 01:05:42,562
看来点名要很久的,威利
It's very likely to be a long roll call, Willi.

622
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:59,880
潜艇在海上干得不错,空军不行
Submarines do well in water, not the Luftwaffe.

623
01:07:02,520 --> 01:07:04,283
放弃吧,施吕特
Give it up, Schluetter.

624
01:07:24,008 --> 01:07:25,669
17 小时
17 hours.

625
01:07:25,743 --> 01:07:29,509
潜艇能近得收到信号
The truck will be close enough to signal.

626
01:07:30,047 --> 01:07:31,571
你是说今晚走？
You mean to go tonight?

627
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:52,863
士兵！
Soldier!

628
01:07:52,937 --> 01:07:55,929
我要和考科斯上校讲话
I want to speak to Sergeant Major Cox.

629
01:08:01,845 --> 01:08:04,370
施莱特上尉交出了2逃犯的名单
Captain Schleutter gave us the names of the two men who escaped.

630
01:08:04,448 --> 01:08:07,975
他下令他的人配合点名
He's instructed his men to stand by for roll call.

631
01:08:11,255 --> 01:08:14,452
为什么他现在屈服了？
Why the hell does he bother to knuckle under now?

632
01:08:14,525 --> 01:08:17,016
我去拿花名册
I'll get identifications on the wire, sir.

633
01:08:17,094 --> 01:08:20,586
卫兵,打开监舍,让这帮狗娘养的进去避雨
Guards. Open the barracks and let the bastards in out of the rain.

634
01:08:26,570 --> 01:08:28,902
不舒服的一天,先生们
It's been an uncomfortable day gentlemen.

635
01:08:29,974 --> 01:08:31,373
晾干
Dry off.

636
01:08:31,442 --> 01:08:37,472
你总是没完,上尉？
You never stop, eh Captain?

637
01:08:38,182 --> 01:08:41,117
你明天的计划是什么？
What are your plans for tomorrow?

638
01:08:41,185 --> 01:08:46,179
先吃饭,然后做梦会女人
First a meal and dreams of warm women.

639
01:08:49,026 --> 01:08:52,894
这他妈的蠢蛋,根本不管我们是否会得肺炎
The damn fool doesn't care if we all get pneumonia.

640
01:08:52,963 --> 01:08:54,396
住口！
Shut up!

641
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:57,125
别象诺伊尔那样找死
Don't hang yourself like Neuchl.

642
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:12,045
通知有关人熄灯后走
Tell the men that we go right after lights out.

643
01:09:12,616 --> 01:09:14,846
我们应该等康纳不太警觉时
We should wait until Connor is less alert.

644
01:09:15,119 --> 01:09:16,416
今晚不走也行的
We don't have to go tonight.

645
01:09:16,754 --> 01:09:18,619
康纳的人手今晚都在监舍里
Connor will have this hands full in this barracks tonight.

646
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:23,018
熄灯后1小时我们在2号房见
We meet in No. 2 barracks an hour after lights out.

647
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:47,974
能完成吗？
Are we going to make it?

648
01:09:48,519 --> 01:09:51,420
快完成了
We've almost finished.

649
01:09:52,189 --> 01:09:55,056
这雨的压力很大
The rain has put a bad strain on the support.

650
01:09:56,694 --> 01:09:58,719
我们会好的,我肯定
We'll be alright, I'm sure.

651
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:16,935
给我们倒杯酒,考科斯
Pour us a drink, Mr. Cox.

652
01:11:21,278 --> 01:11:23,838
给外面的伙计送些去
Take some of that from the stores and give it to the lads outside.

653
01:11:23,914 --> 01:11:27,179
谢谢长官,他们会感谢的
Thank you, sir. The old sweats'll appreciate that.

654
01:11:31,522 --> 01:11:34,320
早晨把诺伊尔的朋友带来,他叫什么来着
In the morning get me that friend of Neuchl's-- what's his name--

655
01:11:34,391 --> 01:11:36,120
伯杰中尉
Lieutenant Berger.

656
01:12:48,932 --> 01:12:50,126
救命！
Help!

657
01:13:19,663 --> 01:13:24,566
卫兵！快出来！快,快！
Guards! Come on out of there! Come on. Move, move!

664

665
01:14:07,177 --> 01:14:11,079
快,别他妈的挡路！快！快！
Come on. Out of the bloody way! Move! Out! Out!

666
01:14:12,716 --> 01:14:15,310
对,搬开这些垃圾

667
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:22,320
你在看什么？继续走

668
01:14:35,272 --> 01:14:37,069
走  - 安静  - 走！

677
01:16:32,589 --> 01:16:34,648
找到该死的地道

678
01:17:42,993 --> 01:17:46,019
- 发生了什么事？  - 我不太清楚,长官

康纳上尉现在那里
Captain Connor's up there now, sir.

682
01:17:53,069 --> 01:17:57,028
是吗？他派的外部巡逻检查了没？
Is he? Has he checked round his exterior patrols?

683
01:17:57,107 --> 01:18:00,099
- 还没有,长官  - 现在去做

- Have you got the count yet?   - Not yet, Major.

690
01:21:04,694 --> 01:21:07,390
37人失踪

691
01:21:08,798 --> 01:21:11,426
我想我们找到了地道,长官

692
01:21:19,676 --> 01:21:21,644
别进,塌了

696
01:21:39,462 --> 01:21:42,488
不,长官。要挖几个小时
No, sir. It'll take several hours of digging.

697

It needn't have happened. I'm sending you a complete report in a few hours.

698
01:21:48,805 --> 01:21:51,569
不,长官。他没完成什么
No, sir. He hasn't accomplished a thing.

01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:54,576

一点也不简单

730
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:46,305
比去年加拿大鲍曼维尔战俘营的事更严重
Worse than what happened at Bowmanville Camp in Canada last year...

731
01:24:46,382 --> 01:24:49,408
英国政府认为那是个灾难

732
01:24:49,485 --> 01:24:51,851
佩里给总参谋部写了详细报告

That's dead right. Now, let's get back, shall we, old chap?

我不管什么优先级别

我再要3架飞机

苏格兰海岸,并到处是伪装

740
01:25:22,218 --> 01:25:24,152
他们不能搜索遍
and how in the hell can they cover it all.

741
01:25:24,220 --> 01:25:27,121
高沼地北部公路网 -- 没有

742
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:30,057
又一个电话,长官

743
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:37,725
恐怕必须调用地方警察,长官
I'm afraid it's essential to use civilian police, sir.

744
01:26:02,825 --> 01:26:05,123

No, sir. Explosives are under the ministry of Fuel and Power.

749
01:26:41,064 --> 01:26:44,158
在战时从不安排
The escort duty our men are assigned to is never for...

750
01:26:44,233 --> 01:26:47,600
工业或矿上护送任务

基地,这是零468

驶向B828号公路

756
01:28:28,771 --> 01:28:30,864
呆在那里,不要靠近
Stay up there. Don't move in close.

757
01:28:30,940 --> 01:28:33,170

758
01:28:39,515 --> 01:28:41,847
离开他  - 转向右
Let's lose him   - turn right in here.

759
01:29:18,154 --> 01:29:22,147

They're either goin' for the Firth of Lorne or else Loch Linnhe.

760
01:29:22,225 --> 01:29:24,523
他们将带我们找到潜艇
And they're gonna lead us right to the sub.

761
01:29:24,594 --> 01:29:27,222
直接到,太好了
Straight away. Splendid.

762
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,265
它必须浮出水面和靠近海滩,是吗？
It has to come to the surface and move in to the beach, doesn't it?

763
01:29:30,333 --> 01:29:32,733
是的,但若找不到他们就有我们受的了
Y eah, but if we miss them, we've had it.

764
01:29:32,802 --> 01:29:34,736
抓住他们,就没事了
Bag them now and call that good.

765
01:29:34,804 --> 01:29:38,240
- 我看不到卡车了  - 上帝保佑
- I have lost contact with the truck.   - Ben, for God's sake.

天黑后什么也看不见

伪装卡车
Camouflage the truck.

784
01:35:01,096 --> 01:35:05,226
这是白女士7号

785
01:35:05,301 --> 01:35:08,862
你在用海军频道,43号机,我没有授权 --
You are on a navy frequency, Flight 43. I have no authorization--

786

I know that. I'm just tellin' you the sub will surface and sit there.

787
01:35:12,775 --> 01:35:15,107
知不知道会在哪里？
Have any idea where that might be?

788
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:18,203

这是浪费时间
That's a waste of time.

790

把它推进洞里快走
Let's drive it down this hole and get going.

船先到

看到了吗？下去

01:39:11,246 --> 01:39:15,114
- 我说,你没经授权  - 你怎么会那样想？
- I say, you're not authorized.   - Where'd you get an idea like that?

807
01:39:15,184 --> 01:39:18,210
- 飞行控制  - 他们扯你后腿
- Flight Control.   - They're pullin' your leg.

808

再飞一圈,我给你搞勋章
Make another run offshore like a good fellow and I'll get you a medal.

快,我在你后面

下到那里,震开他们
Go on down there. Buzz the hell out of 'em.

你能到吗,它要下潜了！
Will you get in there. It'll submerge on you!

817

我们好象被击中了,长官。最好找个地方降落
Looks like we've been hit, sir. Better find a place to put her down.
