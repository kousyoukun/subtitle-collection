2
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,407
Guard, halt.

3
00:01:23,476 --> 00:01:25,068
Handcuffs.

4
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,538
Left turn.

5
00:01:28,614 --> 00:01:30,206
Corporal.

6
00:02:07,019 --> 00:02:09,886
Come on, let's have you!
Get fell in!

7
00:02:09,955 --> 00:02:13,049
It's roll call!
Let's have you!

8
00:02:18,431 --> 00:02:21,832
- Sergeant, check the other huts.
- Quick march, double!

9
00:02:21,901 --> 00:02:24,631
Come on! Move! Move!

10
00:02:35,981 --> 00:02:40,509
Come on! Fall out for roll call,
or it's blood for breakfast!

11
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:43,350
Kapitan Schleutter's compliments
to Major Perry.

12
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,686
He will speak only to the Major.

13
00:02:58,137 --> 00:03:00,071
The P.A.

14
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,344
Captain Schleutter, your men
will now fall in for roll call...

15
00:03:09,415 --> 00:03:13,351
and 25 of them will be handcuffed,
as previously ordered.

16
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:22,423
Your country started this
in violating the Geneva Convention.

17
00:03:22,495 --> 00:03:24,929
Twenty-five British officers
were shackled...

18
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:27,431
in Ludwigsdorf Prison in Germany.

19
00:03:34,607 --> 00:03:39,442
After roll call, we must handcuff
25 of your officers...

20
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:41,446
Captain Schleutter.

21
00:03:48,554 --> 00:03:50,488
How do you plan
to do that, Major?

22
00:03:50,556 --> 00:03:53,616
There are 600 of us
and we don't agree.

23
00:03:55,127 --> 00:03:57,925
You leave me no alternative
but to result to force.

24
00:04:05,805 --> 00:04:08,273
Bloody man.
I mean, can't he see?

25
00:05:34,827 --> 00:05:37,489
There's nothing for it.

26
00:05:37,563 --> 00:05:38,996
- Bring 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

27
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,931
Major Cox, bring those men up here.

28
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:15,895
Squad, mark time!

29
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:19,233
Squad, halt!

30
00:06:19,305 --> 00:06:20,237
Sir!

31
00:06:20,306 --> 00:06:23,366
Mr. Cox, enter barracks number one...

32
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:26,206
and place Captain Schleutter
under arrest.

33
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,473
Y es, sir!
Gates!

34
00:06:31,884 --> 00:06:34,011
Company, double march!

35
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,644
Come on, let's go!

36
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,585
I want no part of this, understand?

37
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,022
All guard towers...

38
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,422
this is Major Perry.

39
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,827
There is to be no shooting...

40
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,419
unless a prisoner
crosses the trip wire.

41
00:07:18,497 --> 00:07:20,988
Is that understood?

42
00:07:44,723 --> 00:07:46,623
Cease firing.

43
00:07:46,692 --> 00:07:48,626
Come out, you kraut swine!

44
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:54,162
Why don't you come in here?!

45
00:07:58,303 --> 00:07:59,235
Bastards!

46
00:08:01,807 --> 00:08:03,399
Gas grenades in.

47
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,909
Tear gas, they're past the wire.

48
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:41,269
Come on! Double it up!

49
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:58,121
I want 12 men.
Six with me and six around the back.

50
00:08:58,197 --> 00:09:00,927
Those men, pronto!
Cover the other side!

51
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:26,817
Drop back and form a line!

52
00:09:31,697 --> 00:09:33,494
Fix bayonets!

53
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:41,772
All guard towers...

54
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,340
there is to be no shooting
unless they cross the trip wire.

55
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:54,848
Soldiers, stand guard!

56
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:57,648
Move it up!

57
00:10:02,094 --> 00:10:05,029
Hurry up! Get in there!
Go round that side.

58
00:10:15,808 --> 00:10:17,969
Is the Luftwaffe...above all this.

59
00:10:18,677 --> 00:10:19,803
Come on - get going.

60
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,674
Go to the devil.

61
00:10:24,316 --> 00:10:26,375
What a bunch of idiots.

62
00:10:44,236 --> 00:10:47,763
Get the Tommies out of here.
Out!...Out!...Out!

63
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:51,575
Close the gates!

64
00:11:16,201 --> 00:11:18,795
Send your handcuffs
back to London, Major Perry.

65
00:11:18,871 --> 00:11:22,739
Captain Schleutter, I'm entitled
by the Geneva Convention...

66
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:25,777
to punish you and your men
for this incredible behavior!

67
00:11:25,844 --> 00:11:30,543
You'll be confined to your huts
on restricted diet for 48 hours!

68
00:11:30,616 --> 00:11:33,278
All privileges
and electric power...

69
00:11:33,352 --> 00:11:35,513
will be curtailed
for that period.

70
00:11:37,222 --> 00:11:39,213
And at the end of that period...

71
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:43,387
you will fall in for roll call
in proper order.

72
00:11:43,462 --> 00:11:45,396
As indeed you are now.

73
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:50,131
Send your handcuffs back to London
and stay out of our camp until you do.

74
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:55,432
Did you have relations
with an enlisted personnel...

75
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:57,441
Captain Connor?

76
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,778
I did, sir.

77
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:04,111
She was willing.

78
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,242
Did you strike an officer
of His Majesty's Navy?

79
00:12:07,319 --> 00:12:11,050
Not at all.
I said something or other.

80
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:15,219
He gave me a sort of push.
It wasn't anything.

81
00:12:15,294 --> 00:12:18,593
The police report called it
"aggravated assault."

82
00:12:18,664 --> 00:12:19,631
Did it?

83
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:23,495
Your past record
indicates that you were...

84
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:25,661
drunk with four enlisted men...

85
00:12:25,737 --> 00:12:29,639
and absent without leave...

86
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,471
six times.

87
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:35,479
Even though you are currently
awaiting orders for your next posting...

88
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,448
that is not a license
to ignore military regulations...

89
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:40,485
and bring disgrace
to the uniform.

90
00:12:40,552 --> 00:12:41,985
Yes, sir.

91
00:12:42,054 --> 00:12:45,683
It is within the authority
of this review board...

92
00:12:45,757 --> 00:12:48,521
to reduce you in rank
to the lowest commissioned rating.

93
00:12:48,593 --> 00:12:54,088
However, we have been requested
to hold our decision in abeyance...

94
00:12:54,166 --> 00:12:56,100
by His Majesty's lntelligence.

95
00:12:56,168 --> 00:13:00,434
- General Kerr wishes to question you.
- Ben Kerr?

96
00:13:00,505 --> 00:13:03,440
So it's a balls-up again, eh, Jack?

97
00:13:03,508 --> 00:13:06,602
The army must be in a bad way
for generals, makin' you one.

98
00:13:06,678 --> 00:13:10,808
- You've got that bit right at least.
- What's an editor do in the army?

99
00:13:10,882 --> 00:13:14,943
Write stories about Hitler's sex life
and send 'em off to the newspapers?

100
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,218
We put corrupt and ill-assorted talents
like yours to work winning the war.

101
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,758
I've requested your
transfer to lntelligence.

102
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:25,763
Why in hell you want to do that?

103
00:13:25,831 --> 00:13:27,856
You're going to run
a P.O.W. camp in Scotland.

104
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:30,731
God, Benny.
I'm not a policeman.

105
00:13:30,802 --> 00:13:33,066
Damn good crime reporter, though.

106
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,266
You've been a chaotic bastard
for as long as I've known you.

107
00:13:36,341 --> 00:13:40,175
But you have a perverse sort of genius
for setting things in order around you--

108
00:13:40,245 --> 00:13:43,009
when you've a mind to.

109
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:45,675
I've a mind to go
on a holiday at the moment.

110
00:13:45,751 --> 00:13:48,481
Well, that review board
will see that you get it.

111
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:51,613
Jack, I'm saving your
royal lrish ass for you...

112
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,093
and giving you the chance to do the sort
of job you've always been keen on doing.

113
00:13:56,161 --> 00:13:59,096
Prisoners of war?
I puke, sir.

114
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:01,189
Now get stuffed, Jack.

115
00:14:01,266 --> 00:14:04,235
I need you. I need your
great nose to the ground.

116
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:08,199
The German prisoners,
all top-line officers...

117
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:12,334
have been raising a peculiar sort of
hell at McKenzie the past few months.

118
00:14:12,411 --> 00:14:14,845
Other camps, relative quiet.

119
00:14:14,913 --> 00:14:18,246
McKenzie, veritable state of siege.

120
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:23,684
Both War Office and lntelligence want
to find out if there's any connection...

121
00:14:23,755 --> 00:14:27,247
any link with
the dear old Deutschland.

122
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:28,758
You have full authorization...

123
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:31,091
to do what you must
to bring the camp around...

124
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:33,427
and find out
what we need to know.

125
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:36,023
A Major Perry's
in command there.

126
00:14:37,269 --> 00:14:39,464
The captain tells the major
how to run his camp?

127
00:14:41,073 --> 00:14:43,007
I thought that would amuse you.

128
00:14:43,075 --> 00:14:46,567
He'll be instructed to cooperate
with Military lntelligence and so on.

129
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:49,738
What about that review board?

130
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:53,012
Have you any ideas
how to keep them off my back?

131
00:14:54,486 --> 00:14:58,217
I shall ponder the matter, old boy.

132
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,258
Can you give me
something for diarrhea...

133
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:02,259
headache or constipation?

134
00:15:02,327 --> 00:15:04,852
Y es, here he comes--
Major Perry!

135
00:15:07,132 --> 00:15:09,066
English. English.

136
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:14,167
Why are those boys fighting?

137
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:17,174
Why does that schoolmaster
not stop them?

138
00:15:17,242 --> 00:15:19,904
Here he comes-- Major Perry!

139
00:15:36,027 --> 00:15:38,154
Quiet...quiet.
There's more to come.

140
00:15:39,197 --> 00:15:42,963
The next one who whistles
will be fined 10 marks.

141
00:15:48,673 --> 00:15:52,507
All the English have fat asses

142
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:56,206
Major Perry, Sergeant Cox

143
00:15:56,281 --> 00:16:00,081
We would like
to give them handcuffs

144
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:03,918
Put them in a six-feet box

145
00:16:03,989 --> 00:16:07,686
When the war is gone and finished

146
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,593
And we win the victory

147
00:16:11,663 --> 00:16:15,394
Deutschland then
will be much bigger

148
00:16:15,467 --> 00:16:19,460
England then belongs to you and me

149
00:16:19,538 --> 00:16:23,235
When the war is gone and finished

150
00:16:23,308 --> 00:16:27,039
And we win the victory

151
00:16:27,112 --> 00:16:31,014
Deutschland then
will be much bigger

152
00:16:31,082 --> 00:16:34,916
England then belongs to you and me

153
00:16:34,986 --> 00:16:38,888
We can stay in Camp McKenzie

154
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:44,259
For England then belongs
to you and me

155
00:16:53,104 --> 00:16:55,368
Three cheers
for Commandant Schluetter...

156
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,464
...hip hip, hooray.

157
00:17:20,332 --> 00:17:22,766
It's a bloody English music hall.

158
00:17:24,236 --> 00:17:26,466
Is more fun in here without
the English Tommies, eh?

159
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,501
All of you - thanks for this morning.

160
00:17:41,786 --> 00:17:44,050
You make a lousy English lady,
Schmidt.

161
00:17:44,122 --> 00:17:46,818
She's too Jewish looking!

162
00:17:49,127 --> 00:17:51,994
Neuchl, you should take the part.

163
00:17:52,063 --> 00:17:53,997
You'd make a hell
of an English lady.

164
00:17:59,004 --> 00:18:02,440
Why not bring your friend, Berger,
up here to the stage...

165
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:05,408
and do the sketch for us
like two English ladies?

166
00:18:07,579 --> 00:18:08,807
Won't you?

167
00:18:10,048 --> 00:18:13,381
Your position, Kapitan,
is not so to give me such insult.

168
00:18:13,451 --> 00:18:16,511
My position as your
commanding officer is so...

169
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:19,216
to have you killed
for being a coward, if I must.

170
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,191
Are you not a coward?

171
00:18:21,259 --> 00:18:23,557
I obey the rules
of a prisoner of war.

172
00:18:25,497 --> 00:18:28,591
As the German Camp Commandant...

173
00:18:28,667 --> 00:18:33,764
...you know the Geneva Convention
forbids you to incite a riot.

174
00:18:35,907 --> 00:18:37,841
You are a homosexual,
are you not?

175
00:18:44,482 --> 00:18:47,417
Sorry. Your English is poor.

176
00:18:48,053 --> 00:18:50,578
You're a queer aren't you?

177
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:55,749
Why don't you ask Berger here
to the stage?

178
00:18:55,827 --> 00:18:59,024
You can hug and kiss and
have a lovely queer wedding.

179
00:19:16,681 --> 00:19:17,875
I'll see you later.

180
00:19:33,031 --> 00:19:37,024
To hell with orders,
let's make a victory fire.

181
00:19:49,514 --> 00:19:51,948
Quite right, Mr. Cox.
Fireworks night.

182
00:19:52,016 --> 00:19:54,712
They're flaunting
the blackout regulations, sir.

183
00:19:54,786 --> 00:19:57,380
Yes, celebrating
my 48-hour punishment.

184
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:00,754
- We'll see to that, sir.
- You'll see to what?

185
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:04,625
You'll see to it that
we're all made fools of once again.

186
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:07,722
Will you move men in there
to enforce blackout regulations?

187
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:12,168
Jerry will have disappeared by
the time you get there, laughing at us.

188
00:20:12,237 --> 00:20:14,762
Your men will get a few more
broken heads for their pains.

189
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,172
The bleeding krauts are lightin' up
the sky askin' for a raid, sir.

190
00:20:18,243 --> 00:20:22,612
There's never been a raid within
100 miles of this desolate chicken farm!

191
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,080
Only alerts.
I mean, why bomb this?

192
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,349
This understaffed, ill-manned outpost
of military mediocrities.

193
00:20:35,026 --> 00:20:37,460
Thank you.
That'll be all.

194
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:43,027
Make transport arrangements for
a Captain Connor coming up from London.

195
00:20:43,101 --> 00:20:46,036
- The details are in the orderly room.
- Yes, sir.

196
00:20:54,846 --> 00:20:57,747
Shall we finish the game, Mr. Hall?

197
00:20:57,816 --> 00:20:59,750
As you like, sir.

198
00:21:04,489 --> 00:21:06,081
Sorry.

199
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:09,750
I went a bit too far.

200
00:21:11,963 --> 00:21:15,262
I'm damned if I know
what Whitehall expects.

201
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:20,361
"Don't move too aggressively. Thousands
of our chaps in German prison camps."

202
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:22,167
And I quite agree.

203
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,403
"But can't you maintain
order there, Major Perry?"

204
00:21:25,477 --> 00:21:29,470
And when I ask for troop reinforcements,
they send me a single Captain Connor.

205
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:33,381
"Let him have a look at the matter."
I mean, oh, dear.

206
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:43,051
With those uniforms you look
more British than the Guard.

207
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:45,725
No one will stop you once
you are out of the gate.

208
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:04,181
It's our Scottish contact.

209
00:22:04,249 --> 00:22:07,377
He'll be waiting for Hochbauer
and Schmidt on the Glenfoyle Road.

210
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:08,885
Good.

211
00:22:17,529 --> 00:22:18,791
B is for Berlin and breakout.

212
00:22:18,997 --> 00:22:20,521
What did Berlin say?

213
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:23,566
English.
It wasn't Berlin.

214
00:22:23,635 --> 00:22:25,796
It was our friend
here in Scotland...

215
00:22:25,870 --> 00:22:27,861
and he agrees to
an earlier meeting with you.

216
00:22:27,939 --> 00:22:31,204
Let's raise a little hell when
Perry tries to put on the handcuffs...

217
00:22:31,276 --> 00:22:34,302
and you can march straight off
and join the British army.

218
00:22:38,216 --> 00:22:42,550
We used to have picnics here
when I first came. It was grand.

219
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,989
They were so lonely, the German lads,
and they were so nice.

220
00:22:48,059 --> 00:22:51,927
Then they made the rule, I guess.
Closed the camp tight.

221
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:55,165
When was that?

222
00:22:55,233 --> 00:22:57,724
About a year ago,
when the headmaster came.

223
00:22:57,802 --> 00:23:00,930
Uh, the Major.
Major Perry, that is.

224
00:23:02,006 --> 00:23:05,169
When Major Perry came, sir.

225
00:23:24,262 --> 00:23:25,991
You're a bunch of weaklings.

226
00:23:35,173 --> 00:23:37,937
Now it's the Lufwaffe's turn.

227
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:43,843
Good morning, Captain Schleutter.

228
00:23:43,915 --> 00:23:46,008
Thank you for the list
you sent me this morning.

229
00:23:46,084 --> 00:23:49,076
But there are others of us
who speak excellent English.

230
00:23:49,354 --> 00:23:51,151
Your English is excellent, Kranz.

231
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:54,356
The tunnel was begun
before you came here.

232
00:23:54,425 --> 00:23:57,690
Your list, the 28 men who are to escape,
are all U-boat men.

233
00:23:57,762 --> 00:24:00,287
None of my men.
None of Unger's engineers.

234
00:24:00,365 --> 00:24:07,100
I took the tunnel over
on orders from Hitler and Doenitz.

235
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:15,738
In order to get skilled U-boat men
back into the war.

236
00:24:15,813 --> 00:24:17,644
Germany must have them now.

237
00:24:17,882 --> 00:24:20,009
I understand, but my men
want some explanation.

238
00:24:20,084 --> 00:24:24,180
You're a Luftwaffe Commandant.
Do you explain orders?

239
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:28,282
I want some explanation about the
way you treated Neuchl.

240
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:34,724
That flying fairy, Hauptman,
he's a bad German.

241
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:49,205
Yes, I've spent a very decent
holiday or two in lreland.

242
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,114
What made you decide to suspend
the outside privileges for the Germans?

243
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:57,177
I felt that my predecessor had taken
too many liberties with regulations.

244
00:24:58,122 --> 00:25:00,522
As a matter of fact,
Von Westhofen agreed with me--

245
00:25:00,591 --> 00:25:04,652
the German senior officer in the camp
until his death last April.

246
00:25:04,729 --> 00:25:07,493
Nice old boy,
General Von Westhofen.

247
00:25:07,565 --> 00:25:09,362
A great feeling for books.

248
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:14,898
Complete opposite of the young devil now
in command. You've heard of Schleutter?

249
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,099
Yes. What did the
nice old boy die of?

250
00:25:17,175 --> 00:25:19,143
- A natural death?
- Heart attack.

251
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:31,078
Morning.

252
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:34,647
Captain Connor's
been sent up from London.

253
00:25:34,726 --> 00:25:38,389
He's to assist me
in analyzing the problems here.

254
00:25:49,474 --> 00:25:52,568
When are you goin' to lift
your 48-hour siege, sir?

255
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:54,577
Tomorrow morning at reveille.

256
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:00,716
- Let's have a look inside then.
- I think not, Captain.

257
00:26:00,785 --> 00:26:03,117
It would weaken the effect
of the punishment.

258
00:26:03,187 --> 00:26:05,121
I should have a look around.

259
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:09,755
Captain, 12 men were seriously
injured in there yesterday.

260
00:26:09,827 --> 00:26:12,159
If you go in,
it's your responsibility.

261
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:13,754
Yes, sir.

262
00:26:15,066 --> 00:26:17,466
- Does that phone go to all the towers?
- Yes, sir.

263
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:19,127
Excuse me.

264
00:26:26,344 --> 00:26:28,278
This is Captain Connor speaking.

265
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,207
I'm comin' inside now.

266
00:26:34,485 --> 00:26:36,749
Will you come along, Mr. Cox?

267
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,293
Reinforcements - one more man!

268
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:31,571
Looks like we have company.

269
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:49,058
What do you suppose
Von Westhofen died of, Mr. Cox?

270
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:52,027
I expect it was
as Major Perry said, sir.

271
00:27:52,096 --> 00:27:54,223
I'd like your opinion on that.

272
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:57,233
Well, he always seemed
in the best of health to me, sir.

273
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,837
You think Schleutter
got rid of him?

274
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:05,933
The bastard has control now.
That's all I know.

275
00:28:10,948 --> 00:28:13,542
- Have you had any escapes?
- A few.

276
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:16,781
Most of them get picked up
in the local whorehouse.

277
00:28:17,788 --> 00:28:20,621
A couple did make it across
to the lrish Free State.

278
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:24,559
Hell, you say.
Horrible place to wind up.

279
00:28:25,396 --> 00:28:27,421
There's only one way
to handle prisoners, sir.

280
00:28:28,299 --> 00:28:30,494
Lock 'em up someplace so tight...

281
00:28:30,568 --> 00:28:33,901
that all they can do
is eat, sleep and shit.

282
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,440
But the Geneva Convention
wouldn't abide it.

283
00:28:52,657 --> 00:28:54,591
Do they have any workshops?

284
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:57,958
They can make almost
anything you care to name.

285
00:28:58,029 --> 00:29:01,396
Made uniforms as good as new
for their top officers.

286
00:29:01,465 --> 00:29:05,367
They've got the lot:
tinkers, tailors.

287
00:29:05,436 --> 00:29:08,928
-Candlestick makers, I shouldn't wonder.
-Did they make any guns yet?

288
00:29:09,006 --> 00:29:12,908
We search, we try to surprise them.
We find nothing.

289
00:29:14,445 --> 00:29:17,175
It turns out
we always get the surprises.

290
00:29:17,248 --> 00:29:19,648
- Is that Schleutter?
- Ay, number one barracks.

291
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:22,049
To be sure.

292
00:29:29,093 --> 00:29:31,084
"Quiet Willi."

293
00:29:31,162 --> 00:29:34,325
His men aren't so quiet, though.
He's seen to that.

294
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:38,061
He's got more authority here
than he ever had on a U-boat.

295
00:29:38,135 --> 00:29:41,662
I heard about his playin'
at war games yesterday.

296
00:29:41,739 --> 00:29:44,674
- Exciting, was it?
- You're dead right, sir.

297
00:29:44,742 --> 00:29:48,178
That's the mess hall up there.
Around the corner is the cooler.

298
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:51,112
The Major hasn't made
enough use of it yet, sir.

299
00:29:56,721 --> 00:29:58,655
Are you irritated by this lot?

300
00:29:58,723 --> 00:30:01,817
- I could do without them, sir.
- Quick march, then.

301
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,196
That's lovely topsoil, Willi.

302
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:50,764
Were you satisfied with
your turnip inspection, Captain?

303
00:30:50,841 --> 00:30:52,809
Just grand.

304
00:30:52,877 --> 00:30:55,141
You're not puttin' the dirt
from your tunnel there, are you?

305
00:30:56,213 --> 00:30:59,580
Tunnel?
You're old-fashioned, Captain.

306
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,210
That's right.

307
00:31:02,286 --> 00:31:04,720
Yes, there must be
a better way than that.

308
00:31:16,067 --> 00:31:18,001
Attention, please.

309
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:20,003
This is Major Perry.

310
00:31:20,838 --> 00:31:25,070
I am assigning Captain Connor officer
in charge of roll call tomorrow morning.

311
00:31:26,143 --> 00:31:29,544
He will supervise
the selection and handcuffing...

312
00:31:29,613 --> 00:31:33,242
of 25 German officers
immediately after roll call.

313
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:35,080
Thank you.

314
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:48,291
There must be a better way.

315
00:31:58,242 --> 00:32:00,574
We keep this entrance
from N.2. barracks clear...

316
00:32:00,644 --> 00:32:02,305
...since it is the main escape hatch.

317
00:32:03,013 --> 00:32:05,038
If you will follow me to No.3.

318
00:32:05,249 --> 00:32:07,683
You can inspect the Attic there.

319
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,761
Careful climbing through
the latrine closet.

320
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,632
There is no light until the Attic.

321
00:32:40,918 --> 00:32:43,546
I have calculated the load
on the ceiling.

322
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:46,653
We have 17,000 cubic centimeters
of dirt.

323
00:32:47,191 --> 00:32:50,786
I've installed cable supports...

324
00:32:50,861 --> 00:32:54,888
...crude but effective.

325
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:16,815
It's difficult with
the advanced schedule.

326
00:33:17,188 --> 00:33:21,318
We don't have the incentive
of being among those to escape.

327
00:33:27,898 --> 00:33:30,526
Of course solving the problem
is incentive enough for me.

328
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:33,330
I am an engineer.

329
00:33:34,538 --> 00:33:36,130
Be a fast engineer, Unger.

330
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,560
We are five meters from the fence...

331
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:05,059
...and 26 meters from the stream.

332
00:34:08,038 --> 00:34:12,737
We will have to use the roof space
in Barracks 2.

333
00:34:13,577 --> 00:34:16,546
Barracks 3 will soon be filled.

334
00:34:19,483 --> 00:34:21,713
- Good evening, Mr. Cox.
- Good evening, sir.

335
00:34:21,785 --> 00:34:25,243
- You ordered reveille at 0600 hours.
- That's right.

336
00:34:25,322 --> 00:34:28,018
And C Company to fall out
with 25 handcuffs.

337
00:34:28,092 --> 00:34:30,083
Right.

338
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,822
And call the fire brigade,
will you?

339
00:34:32,896 --> 00:34:34,830
- Fire brigade.
- Sir.

340
00:34:54,018 --> 00:34:56,418
Divide them between
the front two ranks.

341
00:34:56,487 --> 00:34:58,421
Two to each rank.

342
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,834
Half left, wheel.

343
00:35:53,077 --> 00:35:55,011
Right wheel!

344
00:35:59,717 --> 00:36:02,481
This is Captain Connor speaking.

345
00:36:02,553 --> 00:36:05,215
To all prisoners:
There'll be immediate roll call.

346
00:36:06,557 --> 00:36:11,221
I repeat: There'll be an immediate
roll call and 25 men will be handcuffed.

347
00:36:14,965 --> 00:36:17,331
Enter the barracks
as previously instructed.

348
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:18,960
Move!

349
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:44,151
Nobody here, sir. Dead empty.
Mother Hubbard.

350
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:45,695
Same here, sir.

351
00:36:48,065 --> 00:36:49,657
Proceed with caution.

352
00:36:51,635 --> 00:36:55,002
Six men to hut two.
On the double!

353
00:37:11,255 --> 00:37:12,620
Move in quickly.

354
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,637
Get back!

355
00:37:34,311 --> 00:37:36,336
You don't have to make it
look this realistic.

356
00:37:42,486 --> 00:37:43,714
Take it easy,
you don't have to kill me.

357
00:37:43,787 --> 00:37:45,516
Hey, you two men!

358
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:46,647
Get back!

359
00:37:47,791 --> 00:37:50,259
Good, now get in there
and mix with the British.

360
00:37:53,263 --> 00:37:55,527
Jerry's taking the bait.

361
00:38:07,878 --> 00:38:11,006
Watch out, the swines have called
the Fire Brigade.

362
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:12,541
Hurry.

363
00:38:28,732 --> 00:38:31,223
Mr. Cox, turn it on!

364
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,608
It's time for the Luftwaffe.
Get Neuchl.

365
00:38:49,253 --> 00:38:50,277
Four men with me.

366
00:41:48,398 --> 00:41:49,729
Get that man!

367
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:15,248
Handcuff the bastards.

368
00:42:31,541 --> 00:42:34,032
Mr. Cox, that'll do.

369
00:42:35,345 --> 00:42:36,607
Off!

370
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:46,011
You seem to have won
an argument over handcuffs, Captain.

371
00:42:47,290 --> 00:42:50,020
And you got all wet, Willi.

372
00:42:50,093 --> 00:42:52,789
Have your men out in one hour
for roll call.

373
00:42:54,064 --> 00:42:57,625
I insist on visiting
your infirmary immediately...

374
00:42:57,701 --> 00:42:59,669
to see to the condition of my men.

375
00:43:00,637 --> 00:43:03,003
Right after the roll call, Willi.

376
00:43:29,366 --> 00:43:32,130
- And speak English.
- Okay.

377
00:43:32,202 --> 00:43:35,831
I'm glad to be out too. But we
have to find our chum in Cathness.

378
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,874
What the hell is he sayin'?

379
00:43:44,481 --> 00:43:46,915
I think he's unconscious, sir.

380
00:43:50,787 --> 00:43:52,778
When he comes around
I want to talk to him.

381
00:43:52,856 --> 00:43:54,915
- Do whatever you have to.
- Do my best.

382
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:02,698
That man's in a very bad way.
Our chaps didn't have to go that far.

383
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:04,859
It wasn't them
that did it to him.

384
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:07,733
It was his own lot.
Damn near killed him.

385
00:44:09,239 --> 00:44:11,673
Working off some
private grudge, perhaps.

386
00:44:11,741 --> 00:44:13,470
Sir, this just came.

387
00:44:13,543 --> 00:44:18,037
Keep a close guard on him, Sergeant.
I don't want anyone near him.

388
00:44:18,114 --> 00:44:19,604
- Captain Connor.
- Sir.

389
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:25,220
The Germans have taken
the handcuffs off our men.

390
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:28,689
- Yes, I knew about that.
- You knew?

391
00:44:28,758 --> 00:44:31,522
I knew before I left London.

392
00:44:31,595 --> 00:44:33,529
Then those men
must be unshackled at once.

393
00:44:33,597 --> 00:44:35,588
Not just yet, sir.

394
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:40,396
Captain, I'm instructed to cooperate
with you, not relinquish my command.

395
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:42,404
Not at all, sir.

396
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:46,374
But you see, you must comply with
what the lntelligence mission requires.

397
00:44:46,443 --> 00:44:50,311
And I didn't come here
just to put down a riot.

398
00:44:51,882 --> 00:44:54,783
Are you formally requesting me
to contravene the Geneva Convention?

399
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:58,045
For a few hours is all.

400
00:44:58,121 --> 00:45:00,214
Very well, Captain Connor.

401
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:03,953
I'm sure today's episode
can only redound to your credit.

402
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:06,251
Sir.

403
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:14,136
I want a complete list
of the numbers and injuries to our men.

404
00:45:32,622 --> 00:45:34,249
Eighty present and correct, sir.

405
00:45:34,324 --> 00:45:36,485
Carry on, Sergeant.

406
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:07,480
Sir, checked parade four.
All present and accounted for.

407
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,855
Parade, dismiss!

408
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:27,875
I have permission to check
on the condition of my men.

409
00:46:27,944 --> 00:46:30,208
Yes, sir.
Go inside, please.

410
00:46:31,648 --> 00:46:33,878
These look like knife cuts.

411
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:36,384
He lost a lot of blood.
Put him to bed.

412
00:46:50,934 --> 00:46:51,866
Where's Neuchl?

413
00:46:52,402 --> 00:46:53,630
In that little room.

414
00:46:56,439 --> 00:47:00,034
- Does the music bother you, sir?
- Not at all.

415
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:04,604
It's a therapy, of course, sir.
Germans are fond of this kind of thing.

416
00:47:04,681 --> 00:47:07,115
I've always collected
classical music because--

417
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,348
Have you any of that
medical brandy?

418
00:47:15,425 --> 00:47:17,017
Y es, sir.

419
00:47:19,362 --> 00:47:21,489
Will you have a drink, Captain?

420
00:47:21,564 --> 00:47:24,624
Do I understand you refuse me
the right to see one of my men?

421
00:47:26,436 --> 00:47:29,530
- Just the one brandy, Corporal, please.
- Y es, sir.

422
00:47:29,606 --> 00:47:32,871
Well, he doesn't seem
to be too anxious to see you.

423
00:47:35,912 --> 00:47:37,971
He got away from those
brutes of yours, didn't he?

424
00:47:39,315 --> 00:47:40,907
They nearly killed him.

425
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:43,282
He's under the care
of the chief surgeon.

426
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,882
You lrish are
just fabulous, Captain.

427
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:53,554
You really have got that
famous lrish imagination.

428
00:47:53,630 --> 00:47:57,589
But your water sports this morning
made such a confusion.

429
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:59,601
Who knows what you saw?

430
00:48:00,703 --> 00:48:03,968
I know what I saw.
I saw a man tryin' to escape.

431
00:48:04,774 --> 00:48:07,265
I'm not contradicting you
really, Captain.

432
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:10,710
You may have seen
an attempted escape.

433
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,941
Is it not the duty
of all prisoners to try?

434
00:48:14,117 --> 00:48:16,415
- Sir.
- Thank you, Corporal.

435
00:48:23,059 --> 00:48:24,492
Toscanini?

436
00:48:26,563 --> 00:48:28,929
Furtwangler does it better.

437
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:43,775
By the way, the German camps have taken
the shackles off the British prisoners.

438
00:48:43,847 --> 00:48:46,441
And we shall reciprocate very soon.

439
00:48:53,790 --> 00:48:56,384
Of course, your lads
did quite a bit of damage.

440
00:48:56,459 --> 00:48:59,155
We'll have to deduct that
from their pay.

441
00:48:59,295 --> 00:49:01,957
And that will be all
for now, Captain.

442
00:49:02,031 --> 00:49:04,795
You'll want to see your men.

443
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:09,168
And Captain,
deduct the damages from my pay.

444
00:49:09,239 --> 00:49:12,231
- Thank you.
- You've done too much as it is.

445
00:49:25,321 --> 00:49:27,915
Keep your eye on that one.
See that he leaves soon.

446
00:49:27,991 --> 00:49:31,392
And don't let anyone else in
without my authorization.

447
00:49:39,302 --> 00:49:41,270
There they are.

448
00:49:41,337 --> 00:49:44,932
Take these books to the prisoners.
I've inspected them.

449
00:49:49,245 --> 00:49:51,179
This is all the Kriegsmariners?

450
00:49:51,247 --> 00:49:53,647
Y es. I separated them.

451
00:49:53,716 --> 00:49:56,651
I don't read German all that well.

452
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:58,710
I don't even know
what the hell I'm lookin' for.

453
00:49:58,788 --> 00:50:01,723
- What's that?
- Ewigkeit.

454
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:07,328
"My dear wife,
it has seemed like an eternity...

455
00:50:07,397 --> 00:50:10,366
since last I kissed your bosom...

456
00:50:10,433 --> 00:50:12,867
and slept with my arms entwined...

457
00:50:12,936 --> 00:50:15,530
around your body."

458
00:50:15,605 --> 00:50:18,039
You read these
horny letters all day?

459
00:50:18,107 --> 00:50:20,701
-That's the function of the post office.
-lt is?

460
00:50:22,812 --> 00:50:25,303
"The turnip fields
are growing, dear...

461
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:29,875
and we are going to do
several plays by Shakespeare.

462
00:50:29,953 --> 00:50:34,856
I wish I had you with me now to put
my arms around and feel your bosom."

463
00:50:34,924 --> 00:50:37,222
Bosom, bosom, bosom.

464
00:50:37,293 --> 00:50:40,262
Why do they put that
Roman numeral in the date?

465
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:43,629
- What date?
- The date has a Roman numeral in it.

466
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,601
- You ever notice that?
- I never noticed that before.

467
00:50:47,737 --> 00:50:50,934
He's got that queer little
German seven...

468
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:55,444
and the one and the two,
but it starts off with a Roman numeral.

469
00:50:56,546 --> 00:51:00,414
We're gonna get us a code man
down here from London...

470
00:51:00,483 --> 00:51:03,077
and have him take a look
at these horny letters.

471
00:51:17,333 --> 00:51:20,200
Get back to bed!
Do you hear me?

472
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:52,792
Look out! They've got a hostage!
Get back to your beds immediately!

473
00:52:20,196 --> 00:52:22,892
Have I kept you waitin', Willi?

474
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:26,492
It's your prison, Captain.
We follow your orders.

475
00:52:26,569 --> 00:52:30,369
You have imposed
your kind of order, haven't you?

476
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,908
- Did you know him well?
- No.

477
00:52:32,975 --> 00:52:35,034
What's his name?
You know that.

478
00:52:35,111 --> 00:52:37,136
Rupert Neuchl.

479
00:52:37,213 --> 00:52:39,738
You have it on your
hospital report.

480
00:52:39,816 --> 00:52:43,081
I mean, he must have regained
consciousness during the day.

481
00:52:43,152 --> 00:52:45,484
He hanged himself.

482
00:52:45,555 --> 00:52:48,490
Do you want to write that
to his family, or should I do it?

483
00:52:48,558 --> 00:52:51,288
It won't be necessary.

484
00:52:51,361 --> 00:52:54,125
- Why'd he hang himself?
- He was weak.

485
00:52:54,197 --> 00:52:56,859
He was a homosexual.
Why do you ask me?

486
00:52:56,933 --> 00:53:00,892
We asked everyone else in the ward.
They didn't see anything, of course.

487
00:53:00,970 --> 00:53:03,962
You're the commanding officer.
Why'd he die?

488
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:05,974
Captain, he died
under your custody.

489
00:53:09,412 --> 00:53:12,711
I smell cognac, I think.

490
00:53:13,516 --> 00:53:15,882
You smell lrish whiskey, I think.

491
00:53:15,952 --> 00:53:18,386
- There you are.
- Thank you.

492
00:53:31,367 --> 00:53:34,131
It's a pity the corpse
never enjoys the wake.

493
00:53:35,104 --> 00:53:38,267
A hell of a nice fellow
to talk to, though.

494
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:39,808
Here's to you, Rupert.

495
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:46,743
Your German--
you're pronouncing it very good today.

496
00:53:46,816 --> 00:53:50,411
You're pronouncin'
your English very good too.

497
00:53:50,486 --> 00:53:52,579
Where'd you learn English, Willi?

498
00:53:52,655 --> 00:53:55,283
Bremen UnterZeeboot Academie,
ten years ago.

499
00:53:56,359 --> 00:53:58,657
- How old are you?
- Twenty-seven.

500
00:54:00,530 --> 00:54:05,092
You must've had a couple of years in the
Hitler Youth Camp then, with some luck.

501
00:54:06,202 --> 00:54:08,227
A lot of luck.

502
00:54:08,304 --> 00:54:10,238
Two years.

503
00:54:11,941 --> 00:54:13,875
And you?

504
00:54:13,943 --> 00:54:15,501
Me what?

505
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:19,674
- I mean, how old?
- I'm 44.

506
00:54:20,983 --> 00:54:24,282
- Still very much alive.
- I'm quite well, thanks.

507
00:54:24,353 --> 00:54:26,548
I mean, your new command
is very much impressed.

508
00:54:26,622 --> 00:54:29,557
One of those nice elderly
British guards told me today...

509
00:54:29,625 --> 00:54:31,559
you were a hell of a journalist.

510
00:54:31,627 --> 00:54:35,757
That's true. I'm a hell of a journalist.
I could make you famous, Willi.

511
00:54:35,832 --> 00:54:38,858
Now why don't you tell the lively old
crime reporter why the man's dead?

512
00:54:41,637 --> 00:54:44,663
You expect me to tell you
that I killed him, and why?

513
00:54:46,209 --> 00:54:48,643
No, you don't have to.

514
00:54:48,711 --> 00:54:50,702
I can see your pleasure
in the kill.

515
00:54:53,149 --> 00:54:55,083
Can you?

516
00:54:58,321 --> 00:55:02,189
Perhaps you can see somebody
who believes in the war...

517
00:55:02,258 --> 00:55:05,694
who believes in his people,
his leaders.

518
00:55:05,761 --> 00:55:08,389
We kill in a war
for those things, huh?

519
00:55:09,532 --> 00:55:11,557
But maybe you don't.

520
00:55:11,634 --> 00:55:16,435
I mean, you're lrish and
you're a captain in the British army.

521
00:55:16,506 --> 00:55:21,170
That same British army that has killed
your own lrish people for centuries.

522
00:55:21,244 --> 00:55:23,678
What do you really believe in?
What kind of order?

523
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:25,680
What laws do you obey?

524
00:55:28,484 --> 00:55:32,386
Well, I obey
as few laws as I have to.

525
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:35,891
And I'm not much
of a one for order.

526
00:55:37,193 --> 00:55:40,424
It has to be, I suppose...

527
00:55:40,496 --> 00:55:43,932
but there's order
and then there's order, isn't there?

528
00:55:45,668 --> 00:55:49,104
Death is a kind of order,
isn't it?

529
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:53,675
I mean, Neuchl there,
he's all in order now.

530
00:55:55,344 --> 00:55:58,871
But, Willi, that's an awful
lot of shit about your people.

531
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:01,712
You've killed two of them
that I know of.

532
00:56:02,852 --> 00:56:04,285
That's not true.

533
00:56:04,353 --> 00:56:07,413
You killed him and you probably killed
your commanding officer as well.

534
00:56:07,490 --> 00:56:10,323
And for that
I'm goin' to see you hang.

535
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,931
You enjoy killing too, huh?

536
00:56:21,537 --> 00:56:25,064
- Mr. Cox.
- Do you not, Captain Connor?

537
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:30,573
See that the Captain's escorted
back to his quarters, if you please.

538
00:56:56,105 --> 00:56:58,039
Gate, gentlemen!

539
00:57:16,492 --> 00:57:19,393
Connor wants me to think
that Neuchl told him something.

540
00:57:19,662 --> 00:57:21,630
I don't think it was much.
I'm not sure.

541
00:57:22,264 --> 00:57:25,028
'28 Submariners' Connor said to me
in German.

542
00:57:25,101 --> 00:57:25,931
My God!

543
00:57:28,404 --> 00:57:30,998
He will do nothing for the moment.

544
00:57:32,008 --> 00:57:33,737
But he'll try to prove
I killed Neuchl.

545
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:37,174
Meanwhile we go ahead of schedule.

546
00:57:38,547 --> 00:57:40,538
Hochbauer and Schmidt
won't be back until Friday.

547
00:57:40,616 --> 00:57:43,847
The tunnel won't reach the stream
for five days.

548
00:57:43,919 --> 00:57:49,915
Tell Unger not to go to the stream.

549
00:57:50,359 --> 00:57:53,624
Divert and go under the Guard house.

550
00:57:56,599 --> 00:57:58,965
It's much shorter.

551
00:57:59,035 --> 00:58:02,300
Don't let the men know it.

552
00:58:03,406 --> 00:58:04,703
Go ahead of schedule.

553
00:58:29,031 --> 00:58:30,965
That's our contact.

554
00:58:33,169 --> 00:58:35,103
Can I give you boys a lift?

555
00:58:35,171 --> 00:58:37,799
What are they writing
home about, Lieutenant?

556
00:58:37,873 --> 00:58:39,306
I can't really tell yet.

557
00:58:39,375 --> 00:58:43,038
It's a question of assembling
the basic code pattern. As you see--

558
00:58:43,112 --> 00:58:45,876
- When will you know anything?
- Hard to say.

559
00:58:45,948 --> 00:58:48,382
Could be a day, could be a week
if there are variations.

560
00:58:48,451 --> 00:58:52,547
But we don't have to wait for a decoded
message to know that we have trouble.

561
00:58:52,621 --> 00:58:55,351
Obviously Schleutter's
at the center of it.

562
00:58:55,424 --> 00:58:57,358
We must transfer him to Blackpool.

563
00:58:57,426 --> 00:59:01,055
- I need him here a bit longer.
- You need him?

564
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:05,726
He's at the center, but of what?
I can't find out if he's in Blackpool.

565
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:21,154
You must block the old tunnel and
be as quick as you can with this one.

566
00:59:25,964 --> 00:59:28,364
Lousy work but necessary.

567
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:52,341
Have you met any resistance
in the barracks, Mr. Cox?

568
01:01:53,645 --> 01:01:54,976
Nothing? Good.

569
01:01:55,047 --> 01:01:58,210
Well, inform me directly
if anything at all happens.

570
01:01:58,283 --> 01:02:00,114
Y es. Thank you, Sergeant Major.

571
01:02:00,185 --> 01:02:04,383
Come in, Captain Connor. I think
you ought to know we're onto something.

572
01:02:04,456 --> 01:02:06,390
Thank you.

573
01:02:06,458 --> 01:02:10,451
It appears that 28 submariners
are due to escape.

574
01:02:10,529 --> 01:02:12,429
There's a U-boat coming
to pick them up.

575
01:02:12,497 --> 01:02:15,933
"U-841 available. Assign 28 men.
Location, date agreeable."

576
01:02:16,001 --> 01:02:19,198
- What's the location and date?
- We checked all the letters.

577
01:02:19,271 --> 01:02:22,934
Specific time must've been set before
in something they received earlier.

578
01:02:23,008 --> 01:02:25,943
It doesn't matter.
We'll move in now and break it up.

579
01:02:26,011 --> 01:02:30,004
There's got to be a tunnel. We'll pull
every barracks apart until we find it.

580
01:02:31,550 --> 01:02:35,008
Lieutenant, could you excuse us
a minute, please?

581
01:02:35,087 --> 01:02:38,545
Go and have a cup of coffee
or something.

582
01:02:51,336 --> 01:02:53,702
What if we were to let 'em go?

583
01:02:53,772 --> 01:02:58,266
Then we could follow and find out where
the rendezvous is and land the sub.

584
01:02:58,343 --> 01:03:00,903
How'd Willi like that?

585
01:03:00,979 --> 01:03:02,344
Permit the escape?

586
01:03:03,081 --> 01:03:06,414
The tunnel's got to come up
within 50 yards of that fence.

587
01:03:06,485 --> 01:03:10,512
All we have to do is put patrols
out there, see where they come through.

588
01:03:11,523 --> 01:03:13,457
We keep radio contact.

589
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:19,028
Then we inform the military and civilian
police all the way out to the coast.

590
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:23,529
Then we nab the sub
and the whole lot.

591
01:03:23,602 --> 01:03:27,197
My job is to run this camp
and account for the prisoners in it.

592
01:03:27,272 --> 01:03:30,571
And curiously enough that doesn't
include letting 28 of them escape...

593
01:03:30,642 --> 01:03:33,372
to further your military career,
Captain.

594
01:03:35,847 --> 01:03:39,044
Under my instructions at this moment,
our men are searching German barracks.

595
01:03:40,552 --> 01:03:43,544
- Perry.
- It's Major Perry, Captain!

596
01:03:43,622 --> 01:03:46,090
I'm your superior officer
and you will respect the rank.

597
01:03:46,158 --> 01:03:49,491
I don't give a damn about
your bloody rank, or anyone else's.

598
01:03:49,561 --> 01:03:52,086
I got sent up here to do a job.

599
01:03:52,164 --> 01:03:55,099
I'm supposed to find out
what's behind that break.

600
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:58,898
If you don't like what I'm doing, call
General Kerr and have him relieve me.

601
01:04:01,973 --> 01:04:04,407
Now bring the men back
and stop that search.

602
01:04:06,578 --> 01:04:09,843
The War Office has given you
a unique authority here.

603
01:04:10,982 --> 01:04:13,576
I suppose I must yield to it.

604
01:04:13,652 --> 01:04:16,587
Even though I believe you
to be mistaken and an arrogant fool.

605
01:04:19,524 --> 01:04:22,084
I'll give the order, Captain.

606
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,754
Then I'll phone London
and have them remove one of us...

607
01:04:24,830 --> 01:04:26,889
from this intolerable situation.

608
01:04:44,216 --> 01:04:47,151
Search has been called off.
Everything back.

609
01:04:48,887 --> 01:04:51,219
Why give up the search, Captain?

610
01:04:51,289 --> 01:04:55,487
Sir! There's something in here
you ought to see, sir.

611
01:05:05,370 --> 01:05:07,634
And this one's just been sick, sir.

612
01:05:11,209 --> 01:05:13,769
Mr. Cashman, we'll have a roll call.

613
01:05:13,845 --> 01:05:16,109
Yes, sir.
Carry on, Sergeant.

614
01:05:18,817 --> 01:05:21,547
- How long have they been away with--
- Who?

615
01:05:23,355 --> 01:05:25,414
I want the names
of these two that escaped.

616
01:05:25,490 --> 01:05:27,549
Sorry. I didn't know them
personally.

617
01:05:31,930 --> 01:05:34,194
Seal off the barracks
until further orders.

618
01:05:39,171 --> 01:05:41,662
It's very likely to be
a long roll call, Willi.

619
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:58,980
Submarines do well in water,
not the Luftwaffe.

620
01:07:01,620 --> 01:07:03,383
Give it up, Schluetter.

621
01:07:23,108 --> 01:07:24,769
17 hours.

622
01:07:24,843 --> 01:07:28,609
The truck will be
close enough to signal.

623
01:07:29,147 --> 01:07:30,671
You mean to go tonight?

624
01:07:50,268 --> 01:07:51,963
Soldier!

625
01:07:52,037 --> 01:07:55,029
I want to speak
to Sergeant Major Cox.

626
01:08:00,945 --> 01:08:03,470
Captain Schleutter gave us the names
of the two men who escaped.

627
01:08:03,548 --> 01:08:07,075
He's instructed his men
to stand by for roll call.

628
01:08:10,355 --> 01:08:13,552
Why the hell does he bother
to knuckle under now?

629
01:08:13,625 --> 01:08:16,116
I'll get identifications
on the wire, sir.

630
01:08:16,194 --> 01:08:19,686
Guards. Open the barracks and
let the bastards in out of the rain.

631
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:28,002
It's been an uncomfortable day
gentlemen.

632
01:08:29,074 --> 01:08:30,473
Dry off.

633
01:08:30,542 --> 01:08:36,572
You never stop, eh Captain?

634
01:08:37,282 --> 01:08:40,217
What are your plans for tomorrow?

635
01:08:40,285 --> 01:08:45,279
First a meal and dreams
of warm women.

636
01:08:48,126 --> 01:08:51,994
The damn fool doesn't care
if we all get pneumonia.

637
01:08:52,063 --> 01:08:53,496
Shut up!

638
01:08:53,665 --> 01:08:56,225
Don't hang yourself like Neuchl.

639
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,145
Tell the men that we go
right after lights out.

640
01:09:11,716 --> 01:09:13,946
We should wait until Connor
is less alert.

641
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:15,516
We don't have to go tonight.

642
01:09:15,854 --> 01:09:17,719
Connor will have this hands full
in this barracks tonight.

643
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:22,118
We meet in No. 2 barracks
an hour after lights out.

644
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,074
Are we going to make it?

645
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:50,520
We've almost finished.

646
01:09:51,289 --> 01:09:54,156
The rain has put a bad strain
on the support.

647
01:09:55,794 --> 01:09:57,819
We'll be alright, I'm sure.

648
01:11:13,771 --> 01:11:16,035
Pour us a drink, Mr. Cox.

649
01:11:20,378 --> 01:11:22,938
Take some of that from the stores
and give it to the lads outside.

650
01:11:23,014 --> 01:11:26,279
Thank you, sir.
The old sweats'll appreciate that.

651
01:11:30,622 --> 01:11:33,420
In the morning get me that friend
of Neuchl's-- what's his name--

652
01:11:33,491 --> 01:11:35,220
Lieutenant Berger.

653
01:12:48,032 --> 01:12:49,226
Help!

654
01:13:18,763 --> 01:13:23,666
Guards! Come on out of there!
Come on. Move, move!

655
01:13:23,735 --> 01:13:28,001
Let's have you!
Go look on the other side!

656
01:13:28,072 --> 01:13:29,664
Come on!

657
01:13:34,512 --> 01:13:37,208
- Which one?
- I don't know.

658
01:13:38,816 --> 01:13:40,977
Hello, towers. Which one?

659
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:44,577
Barracks three. Looks like
the whole damned thing caved in.

660
01:13:44,656 --> 01:13:46,317
Thanks.

661
01:14:01,139 --> 01:14:02,731
Bloody hell!

662
01:14:06,277 --> 01:14:10,179
Come on. Out of the bloody way!
Move! Out! Out!

663
01:14:11,816 --> 01:14:14,410
Right. Let's get through
this rubbish.

664
01:14:19,657 --> 01:14:21,420
What are you looking at?
Get moving.

665
01:14:34,372 --> 01:14:36,169
Go - quietly - Go!

666
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:07,130
Patrols Able, Baker, Charlie, keep in
radio contact with me and the main gate.

667
01:15:12,243 --> 01:15:14,177
Give us an axe.

668
01:15:15,313 --> 01:15:18,248
Get an axe and smash
the other door down.

669
01:15:21,018 --> 01:15:23,578
Get this lot back in their beds
and count 'em.

670
01:15:23,654 --> 01:15:26,350
Get the men back to their beds
for a check.

671
01:15:39,170 --> 01:15:40,762
Now Holtz - collapse it!

672
01:16:11,836 --> 01:16:14,327
Clumsy idiot, you could have
killed us all.

673
01:16:27,919 --> 01:16:30,183
Six dead so far, sir.

674
01:16:31,689 --> 01:16:33,748
Find the damned tunnel.

675
01:17:42,093 --> 01:17:45,119
- What the hell's going on now?
- I don't exactly know, sir.

676
01:17:45,196 --> 01:17:48,529
- Number three's roof's collapsed.
- The roof's collapsed?

677
01:17:48,599 --> 01:17:49,964
Y es, sir.

678
01:17:50,034 --> 01:17:52,093
Captain Connor's up there now, sir.

679
01:17:52,169 --> 01:17:56,128
Is he? Has he checked round
his exterior patrols?

680
01:17:56,207 --> 01:17:59,199
- Not as far as I know, sir.
- Do that now.

681
01:17:59,277 --> 01:18:01,006
Drive on.

682
01:18:19,697 --> 01:18:21,358
You men get the stretcher.

683
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:25,220
I'll see if they've got
the count, sir.

684
01:20:31,028 --> 01:20:34,964
Sergeant, get back down to the main gate
and get a three-tonner here for wounded.

685
01:20:35,032 --> 01:20:37,967
- Have you got the count yet?
- Not yet, Major.

686
01:20:57,321 --> 01:20:59,255
Only ten dead, Connor.

687
01:21:03,794 --> 01:21:06,490
Thirty-seven not accounted for.

688
01:21:07,898 --> 01:21:10,526
I think we've located
the tunnel, sir.

689
01:21:18,776 --> 01:21:20,744
Hold it. It's collapsed.

690
01:21:30,187 --> 01:21:31,848
Yes, sir. Ten dead.

691
01:21:31,922 --> 01:21:34,891
Another 27 trapped
when the tunnel collapsed.

692
01:21:34,959 --> 01:21:37,359
Presumably Captain Schleutter
was with them.

693
01:21:38,562 --> 01:21:41,588
No, sir. It'll take
several hours of digging.

694
01:21:41,665 --> 01:21:45,931
It needn't have happened. I'm sending
you a complete report in a few hours.

695
01:21:47,905 --> 01:21:50,669
No, sir. He hasn't
accomplished a thing.

696
01:21:50,741 --> 01:21:53,676
You may inform General Kerr that
Captain Connor's mission here...

697
01:21:53,744 --> 01:21:56,269
has been a fatal mistake.

698
01:21:58,115 --> 01:21:59,480
Good night, sir.

699
01:22:33,751 --> 01:22:37,209
Nothing, sir.
Not a bloody one of them!

700
01:22:43,827 --> 01:22:46,091
Base Station Five.
This is Connor.

701
01:22:47,665 --> 01:22:50,099
Give us a police frequency.

702
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:59,841
Roadblock in position on A85.

703
01:23:01,779 --> 01:23:05,647
Police report no suspicious traffic
on the B828...

704
01:23:05,716 --> 01:23:07,946
and continue mobile patrols north.

705
01:23:08,852 --> 01:23:11,013
All units.

706
01:23:11,088 --> 01:23:14,888
Per the McKenzie break, escaped
prisoners should be considered armed.

707
01:23:18,229 --> 01:23:20,663
All units station traffic,
please copy.

708
01:23:23,000 --> 01:23:25,230
Northeast of Perth and Aberfeldy...

709
01:23:25,302 --> 01:23:26,826
east to Dunfermline...

710
01:23:26,904 --> 01:23:28,735
south to Falkirk...

711
01:23:28,806 --> 01:23:32,298
southwest to Glasgow,
west to lnverary.

712
01:23:32,376 --> 01:23:36,142
The following roadblocks will go
into effect in the immediate area--

713
01:23:36,213 --> 01:23:40,047
Number 33 between McKenzie
and Stirling.

714
01:23:55,532 --> 01:23:59,093
This is Glengarry police.

715
01:23:59,169 --> 01:24:03,265
We require extra mobiles
to maintain watch on coast road.

716
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,932
Glengarry police, over.

717
01:24:07,878 --> 01:24:09,812
North Shore coast guards.

718
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:12,405
Coastal Command.

719
01:24:12,483 --> 01:24:15,145
We have no response
from northern moorland's road net.

720
01:24:15,219 --> 01:24:18,086
Presumably still in effect
from the Southern Lochs...

721
01:24:18,155 --> 01:24:20,419
as far north as Loch Glenny.

722
01:24:23,460 --> 01:24:27,260
Case section at Clough here.
All units please reply.

723
01:24:27,331 --> 01:24:29,265
Please, repeat, all units.

724
01:24:29,333 --> 01:24:32,268
- Sir! General Kerr's arrived.
- Oh, God.

725
01:24:38,075 --> 01:24:40,976
- What happened?
- Balls-up, sir. Simple as that.

726
01:24:41,045 --> 01:24:42,808
Nothing simple about it.

727
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,405
Worse than what happened at
Bowmanville Camp in Canada last year...

728
01:24:45,482 --> 01:24:48,508
and Whitehall thought
that was a disaster.

729
01:24:48,585 --> 01:24:50,951
Perry's made a full report
to top staff.

730
01:24:51,021 --> 01:24:53,353
I don't blame him.
I could have prevented it.

731
01:24:53,424 --> 01:24:57,622
That's dead right. Now,
let's get back, shall we, old chap?

732
01:25:07,838 --> 01:25:10,033
I don't care what
the priority classification is.

733
01:25:10,107 --> 01:25:12,337
I want three more aircraft.

734
01:25:12,409 --> 01:25:14,343
You're damned right I do.

735
01:25:16,146 --> 01:25:18,580
Coastal Command say there
are several thousand miles...

736
01:25:18,649 --> 01:25:21,243
of naturally camouflaged coastline
around Scotland...

737
01:25:21,318 --> 01:25:23,252
and how in the hell
can they cover it all.

738
01:25:23,320 --> 01:25:26,221
Northern moorlands road net--
nothing.

739
01:25:26,290 --> 01:25:29,157
There's another call for you, sir.

740
01:25:33,230 --> 01:25:36,825
I'm afraid it's essential
to use civilian police, sir.

741
01:26:01,925 --> 01:26:04,223
- lmportant?
- Aye.

742
01:26:04,294 --> 01:26:06,558
Go ahead.

743
01:26:24,515 --> 01:26:26,506
There's a truck on the A828.

744
01:26:26,583 --> 01:26:29,518
Explosives with a police motorcycle
escorting it.

745
01:26:36,627 --> 01:26:40,085
No, sir. Explosives are under
the ministry of Fuel and Power.

746
01:26:40,164 --> 01:26:43,258
The escort duty our men
are assigned to is never for...

747
01:26:43,333 --> 01:26:46,700
industrial or mining purposes
during wartime.

748
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:50,399
- We never assign men for--
- Thanks very much.

749
01:27:07,224 --> 01:27:12,184
Base Section,
this is Zero 468.

750
01:27:12,262 --> 01:27:15,561
I'm over Ballachulish.
All clear, turning south.

751
01:28:21,465 --> 01:28:24,366
There's an explosives truck
with a motorcycle escort...

752
01:28:24,434 --> 01:28:27,801
heading north on Highway B828.

753
01:28:27,871 --> 01:28:29,964
Stay up there.
Don't move in close.

754
01:28:30,040 --> 01:28:32,270
Roger.

755
01:28:38,615 --> 01:28:40,947
Let's lose him - turn right in here.

756
01:29:17,254 --> 01:29:21,247
They're either goin' for
the Firth of Lorne or else Loch Linnhe.

757
01:29:21,325 --> 01:29:23,623
And they're gonna lead us
right to the sub.

758
01:29:23,694 --> 01:29:26,322
Straight away. Splendid.

759
01:29:26,396 --> 01:29:29,365
It has to come to the surface
and move in to the beach, doesn't it?

760
01:29:29,433 --> 01:29:31,833
Y eah, but if we miss them,
we've had it.

761
01:29:31,902 --> 01:29:33,836
Bag them now
and call that good.

762
01:29:33,904 --> 01:29:37,340
- I have lost contact with the truck.
- Ben, for God's sake.

763
01:29:38,609 --> 01:29:41,373
It's the reconnaissance pilot.
He's lost contact.

764
01:30:13,443 --> 01:30:14,774
Quick - get rid of that.

765
01:30:56,653 --> 01:30:58,587
Lost contact.

766
01:30:58,655 --> 01:31:03,592
Suggest immediate police surveillance
north on Highway B828.

767
01:31:05,529 --> 01:31:08,726
- I'll get a plane myself.
- I'll arrange transport, sir.

768
01:31:44,067 --> 01:31:46,831
Where are you men going?

769
01:31:46,903 --> 01:31:50,304
Just going to make
our Yank visitors comfy, Dad.

770
01:32:08,658 --> 01:32:10,125
Load of furniture...

771
01:32:10,193 --> 01:32:13,162
for the C.O. at
the new American base at Mahaddie.

772
01:32:14,898 --> 01:32:16,923
Look.

773
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,434
Even a shower attachment
for the silly bastard.

774
01:32:20,704 --> 01:32:22,797
It's five shillings.

775
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,575
Heave up the tail!
Good man.

776
01:33:11,121 --> 01:33:14,056
Won't be able to see
a bloody thing after dark.

777
01:33:58,068 --> 01:33:59,399
Look-outs up there.

778
01:34:12,282 --> 01:34:13,271
All clear.

779
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:14,908
All clear.

780
01:34:17,087 --> 01:34:18,384
Camouflage the truck.

781
01:35:00,196 --> 01:35:04,326
This is White Lady 7.

782
01:35:04,401 --> 01:35:07,962
You are on a navy frequency, Flight 43.
I have no authorization--

783
01:35:08,038 --> 01:35:11,804
I know that. I'm just tellin' you
the sub will surface and sit there.

784
01:35:11,875 --> 01:35:14,207
Have any idea
where that might be?

785
01:35:14,277 --> 01:35:17,303
Hell, no. If I knew,
I wouldn't be guessin'.

786
01:35:31,061 --> 01:35:32,392
That's a waste of time.

787
01:35:32,462 --> 01:35:35,329
Let's drive it down this hole
and get going.

788
01:35:42,605 --> 01:35:43,697
The boats first.

789
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:18,805
Have you gone crazy?

790
01:36:20,543 --> 01:36:21,510
Stop the truck!

791
01:36:37,260 --> 01:36:38,659
What the hell is going on?

792
01:36:48,671 --> 01:36:50,434
Now what the hell?

793
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:54,938
Do you see that?
Go on down there.

794
01:37:20,837 --> 01:37:24,295
Burning rubbish I should say, sir.
No sign of anything else.

795
01:37:48,098 --> 01:37:49,395
Go on ahead.

796
01:38:09,953 --> 01:38:13,081
This is White Lady 7.

797
01:38:13,156 --> 01:38:16,592
I've just completed a sweep
of grid 16 X-ray.

798
01:38:16,659 --> 01:38:18,923
Sunset in 18 minutes.

799
01:38:18,995 --> 01:38:21,429
Will turn for home at that time.

800
01:38:21,498 --> 01:38:23,489
E.T.A., 1930.

801
01:38:23,566 --> 01:38:25,158
Out.

802
01:39:06,342 --> 01:39:10,278
We have no flight plan for you,
Flight 43. Return to base.

803
01:39:10,346 --> 01:39:14,214
- I say, you're not authorized.
- Where'd you get an idea like that?

804
01:39:14,284 --> 01:39:17,310
- Flight Control.
- They're pullin' your leg.

805
01:39:17,387 --> 01:39:21,585
Make another run offshore like
a good fellow and I'll get you a medal.

806
01:40:26,856 --> 01:40:28,551
Hurry, I'm right behind you.

807
01:40:55,018 --> 01:40:58,419
There's the sub.
Jesus, that's it!

808
01:40:58,488 --> 01:41:00,979
White Lady, this is Flight 43.

809
01:41:01,991 --> 01:41:04,687
Sub's off the point about a mile.

810
01:41:04,761 --> 01:41:07,286
About a mile!
U-boat on the surface.

811
01:41:07,363 --> 01:41:08,990
Engine, full ahead.

812
01:41:19,776 --> 01:41:22,336
Go on down there.
Buzz the hell out of 'em.

813
01:42:44,627 --> 01:42:47,790
Will you get in there.
It'll submerge on you!

814
01:43:05,982 --> 01:43:10,351
Looks like we've been hit, sir.
Better find a place to put her down.

815
01:44:59,595 --> 01:45:02,723
Asdic reports lost contact with U-boat.
Request another sweep.

816
01:45:04,667 --> 01:45:06,862
This is White Lady 7 calling Madam.

817
01:45:10,273 --> 01:45:12,673
U-boat submerged 1924.

818
01:45:12,742 --> 01:45:15,802
Bearing 045 off course head point...

819
01:45:15,878 --> 01:45:18,438
and boarding four prisoners
who were abandoned.

820
01:45:18,514 --> 01:45:22,507
Will continue asdic sweep
on 19 degrees aft from grid 13 easy.

821
01:45:22,585 --> 01:45:24,246
Request assistance.

822
01:45:25,755 --> 01:45:28,280
General Kerr calling Captain Connor.

823
01:45:32,061 --> 01:45:33,358
Come in, Connor.

824
01:45:35,131 --> 01:45:39,659
This is General Kerr
calling Naval Frequency 453.

825
01:45:41,737 --> 01:45:45,332
Willi, looks like we're both
in the shit house.

826
01:45:45,408 --> 01:45:48,707
General Kerr calling Captain Connor.

827
01:45:48,778 --> 01:45:50,575
Come in, Connor.

828
01:45:51,305 --> 01:45:57,751
