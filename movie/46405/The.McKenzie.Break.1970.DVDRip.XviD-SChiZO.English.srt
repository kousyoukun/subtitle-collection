1
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,207
Guard, halt.

2
00:01:16,276 --> 00:01:17,868
Handcuffs.

3
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,338
Left turn.

4
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:23,006
Corporal.

5
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:02,686
Come on, let's have you!
Get fell in!

6
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:05,849
It's roll call!
Let's have you!

7
00:02:11,231 --> 00:02:14,632
- Sergeant, check the other huts.
- Quick march, double!

8
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:17,431
Come on! Move! Move!

9
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:33,309
Come on! Fall out for roll call,
or it's blood for breakfast!

10
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:36,150
Kapitan Schleutter's compliments
to Major Perry.

11
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:38,486
He will speak only to the Major.

12
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:52,871
The P.A.

13
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:02,144
Captain Schleutter, your men
will now fall in for roll call...

14
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:06,151
and 25 of them will be handcuffed,
as previously ordered.

15
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:15,223
Your country started this
in violating the Geneva Convention.

16
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:17,729
Twenty-five British officers
were shackled...

17
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:20,231
in Ludwigsdorf Prison in Germany.

18
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:32,242
After roll call, we must handcuff
25 of your officers...

19
00:03:32,312 --> 00:03:34,246
Captain Schleutter.

20
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:43,288
How do you plan
to do that, Major?

21
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:46,416
There are 600 of us
and we don't agree.

22
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,725
You leave me no alternative
but to result to force.

23
00:03:58,605 --> 00:04:01,073
Bloody man.
I mean, can't he see?

24
00:05:27,627 --> 00:05:30,289
There's nothing for it.

25
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,796
- Bring 'em up.
- Yes, sir.

26
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:37,731
Major Cox, bring those men up here.

27
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:08,695
Squad, mark time!

28
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:12,033
Squad, halt!

29
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,037
Sir!

30
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:16,166
Mr. Cox, enter barracks number one...

31
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:19,006
and place Captain Schleutter
under arrest.

32
00:06:19,078 --> 00:06:21,273
Y es, sir!
Gates!

33
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,811
Company, double march!

34
00:06:57,216 --> 00:06:58,444
Come on, let's go!

35
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,385
I want no part of this, understand?

36
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,822
All guard towers...

37
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:06,222
this is Major Perry.

38
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,627
There is to be no shooting...

39
00:07:08,694 --> 00:07:11,219
unless a prisoner
crosses the trip wire.

40
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,788
Is that understood?

41
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:39,423
Cease firing.

42
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,426
Come out, you kraut swine!

43
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,962
Why don't you come in here?!

44
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,035
Bastards!

45
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:56,199
Gas grenades in.

46
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,709
Tear gas, they're past the wire.

47
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:34,069
Come on! Double it up!

48
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:50,921
I want 12 men.
Six with me and six around the back.

49
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,727
Those men, pronto!
Cover the other side!

50
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:19,617
Drop back and form a line!

51
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,294
Fix bayonets!

52
00:09:33,105 --> 00:09:34,572
All guard towers...

53
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:39,140
there is to be no shooting
unless they cross the trip wire.

54
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:47,648
Soldiers, stand guard!

55
00:09:48,821 --> 00:09:50,448
Move it up!

56
00:09:54,894 --> 00:09:57,829
Hurry up! Get in there!
Go round that side.

57
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,769
Is the Luftwaffe...above all this.

58
00:10:11,477 --> 00:10:12,603
Come on - get going.

59
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,474
Go to the devil.

60
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,175
What a bunch of idiots.

61
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:40,563
Get the Tommies out of here.
Out!...Out!...Out!

62
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:44,375
Close the gates!

63
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,595
Send your handcuffs
back to London, Major Perry.

64
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,539
Captain Schleutter, I'm entitled
by the Geneva Convention...

65
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,577
to punish you and your men
for this incredible behavior!

66
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:23,343
You'll be confined to your huts
on restricted diet for 48 hours!

67
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:26,078
All privileges
and electric power...

68
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,313
will be curtailed
for that period.

69
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,013
And at the end of that period...

70
00:11:32,091 --> 00:11:36,187
you will fall in for roll call
in proper order.

71
00:11:36,262 --> 00:11:38,196
As indeed you are now.

72
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,931
Send your handcuffs back to London
and stay out of our camp until you do.

73
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,232
Did you have relations
with an enlisted personnel...

74
00:11:48,307 --> 00:11:50,241
Captain Connor?

75
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:53,578
I did, sir.

76
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,911
She was willing.

77
00:11:56,982 --> 00:12:00,042
Did you strike an officer
of His Majesty's Navy?

78
00:12:00,119 --> 00:12:03,850
Not at all.
I said something or other.

79
00:12:03,923 --> 00:12:08,019
He gave me a sort of push.
It wasn't anything.

80
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,393
The police report called it
"aggravated assault."

81
00:12:11,464 --> 00:12:12,431
Did it?

82
00:12:13,599 --> 00:12:16,295
Your past record
indicates that you were...

83
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:18,461
drunk with four enlisted men...

84
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:22,439
and absent without leave...

85
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:24,271
six times.

86
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:28,279
Even though you are currently
awaiting orders for your next posting...

87
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:31,248
that is not a license
to ignore military regulations...

88
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,285
and bring disgrace
to the uniform.

89
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,785
Yes, sir.

90
00:12:34,854 --> 00:12:38,483
It is within the authority
of this review board...

91
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:41,321
to reduce you in rank
to the lowest commissioned rating.

92
00:12:41,393 --> 00:12:46,888
However, we have been requested
to hold our decision in abeyance...

93
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,900
by His Majesty's lntelligence.

94
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:53,234
- General Kerr wishes to question you.
- Ben Kerr?

95
00:12:53,305 --> 00:12:56,240
So it's a balls-up again, eh, Jack?

96
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:59,402
The army must be in a bad way
for generals, makin' you one.

97
00:12:59,478 --> 00:13:03,608
- You've got that bit right at least.
- What's an editor do in the army?

98
00:13:03,682 --> 00:13:07,743
Write stories about Hitler's sex life
and send 'em off to the newspapers?

99
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,018
We put corrupt and ill-assorted talents
like yours to work winning the war.

100
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,558
I've requested your
transfer to lntelligence.

101
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,563
Why in hell you want to do that?

102
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,656
You're going to run
a P.O.W. camp in Scotland.

103
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,531
God, Benny.
I'm not a policeman.

104
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,866
Damn good crime reporter, though.

105
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:29,066
You've been a chaotic bastard
for as long as I've known you.

106
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,975
But you have a perverse sort of genius
for setting things in order around you--

107
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:35,809
when you've a mind to.

108
00:13:35,881 --> 00:13:38,475
I've a mind to go
on a holiday at the moment.

109
00:13:38,551 --> 00:13:41,281
Well, that review board
will see that you get it.

110
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,413
Jack, I'm saving your
royal lrish ass for you...

111
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,893
and giving you the chance to do the sort
of job you've always been keen on doing.

112
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,896
Prisoners of war?
I puke, sir.

113
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:53,989
Now get stuffed, Jack.

114
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:57,035
I need you. I need your
great nose to the ground.

115
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:00,999
The German prisoners,
all top-line officers...

116
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:05,134
have been raising a peculiar sort of
hell at McKenzie the past few months.

117
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:07,645
Other camps, relative quiet.

118
00:14:07,713 --> 00:14:11,046
McKenzie, veritable state of siege.

119
00:14:12,218 --> 00:14:16,484
Both War Office and lntelligence want
to find out if there's any connection...

120
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:20,047
any link with
the dear old Deutschland.

121
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:21,558
You have full authorization...

122
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:23,891
to do what you must
to bring the camp around...

123
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:26,227
and find out
what we need to know.

124
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,823
A Major Perry's
in command there.

125
00:14:30,069 --> 00:14:32,264
The captain tells the major
how to run his camp?

126
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,807
I thought that would amuse you.

127
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,367
He'll be instructed to cooperate
with Military lntelligence and so on.

128
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:42,538
What about that review board?

129
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,812
Have you any ideas
how to keep them off my back?

130
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,017
I shall ponder the matter, old boy.

131
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,058
Can you give me
something for diarrhea...

132
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,059
headache or constipation?

133
00:14:55,127 --> 00:14:57,652
Y es, here he comes--
Major Perry!

134
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:01,866
English. English.

135
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:06,967
Why are those boys fighting?

136
00:15:07,039 --> 00:15:09,974
Why does that schoolmaster
not stop them?

137
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,704
Here he comes-- Major Perry!

138
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,954
Quiet...quiet.
There's more to come.

139
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:35,763
The next one who whistles
will be fined 10 marks.

140
00:15:41,473 --> 00:15:45,307
All the English have fat asses

141
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,006
Major Perry, Sergeant Cox

142
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,881
We would like
to give them handcuffs

143
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:56,718
Put them in a six-feet box

144
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,486
When the war is gone and finished

145
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:04,393
And we win the victory

146
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:08,194
Deutschland then
will be much bigger

147
00:16:08,267 --> 00:16:12,260
England then belongs to you and me

148
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,035
When the war is gone and finished

149
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:19,839
And we win the victory

150
00:16:19,912 --> 00:16:23,814
Deutschland then
will be much bigger

151
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:27,716
England then belongs to you and me

152
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:31,688
We can stay in Camp McKenzie

153
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:37,059
For England then belongs
to you and me

154
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:48,168
Three cheers
for Commandant Schluetter...

155
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,264
...hip hip, hooray.

156
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,566
It's a bloody English music hall.

157
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,266
Is more fun in here without
the English Tommies, eh?

158
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,301
All of you - thanks for this morning.

159
00:17:34,586 --> 00:17:36,850
You make a lousy English lady,
Schmidt.

160
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,618
She's too Jewish looking!

161
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:44,794
Neuchl, you should take the part.

162
00:17:44,863 --> 00:17:46,797
You'd make a hell
of an English lady.

163
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,240
Why not bring your friend, Berger,
up here to the stage...

164
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,208
and do the sketch for us
like two English ladies?

165
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,607
Won't you?

166
00:18:02,848 --> 00:18:06,181
Your position, Kapitan,
is not so to give me such insult.

167
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,311
My position as your
commanding officer is so...

168
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,016
to have you killed
for being a coward, if I must.

169
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,991
Are you not a coward?

170
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,357
I obey the rules
of a prisoner of war.

171
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:21,391
As the German Camp Commandant...

172
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:26,564
...you know the Geneva Convention
forbids you to incite a riot.

173
00:18:28,707 --> 00:18:30,641
You are a homosexual,
are you not?

174
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,217
Sorry. Your English is poor.

175
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:43,378
You're a queer aren't you?

176
00:18:44,556 --> 00:18:48,549
Why don't you ask Berger here
to the stage?

177
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,824
You can hug and kiss and
have a lovely queer wedding.

178
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,675
I'll see you later.

179
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,824
To hell with orders,
let's make a victory fire.

180
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,748
Quite right, Mr. Cox.
Fireworks night.

181
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:47,512
They're flaunting
the blackout regulations, sir.

182
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:50,180
Yes, celebrating
my 48-hour punishment.

183
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,554
- We'll see to that, sir.
- You'll see to what?

184
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:57,425
You'll see to it that
we're all made fools of once again.

185
00:19:57,496 --> 00:20:00,522
Will you move men in there
to enforce blackout regulations?

186
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,968
Jerry will have disappeared by
the time you get there, laughing at us.

187
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,562
Your men will get a few more
broken heads for their pains.

188
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:10,972
The bleeding krauts are lightin' up
the sky askin' for a raid, sir.

189
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:15,412
There's never been a raid within
100 miles of this desolate chicken farm!

190
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,880
Only alerts.
I mean, why bomb this?

191
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:23,149
This understaffed, ill-manned outpost
of military mediocrities.

192
00:20:27,826 --> 00:20:30,260
Thank you.
That'll be all.

193
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:35,827
Make transport arrangements for
a Captain Connor coming up from London.

194
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,836
- The details are in the orderly room.
- Yes, sir.

195
00:20:47,646 --> 00:20:50,547
Shall we finish the game, Mr. Hall?

196
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,550
As you like, sir.

197
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:58,881
Sorry.

198
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:02,550
I went a bit too far.

199
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:08,062
I'm damned if I know
what Whitehall expects.

200
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:13,161
"Don't move too aggressively. Thousands
of our chaps in German prison camps."

201
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,967
And I quite agree.

202
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:18,203
"But can't you maintain
order there, Major Perry?"

203
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:22,270
And when I ask for troop reinforcements,
they send me a single Captain Connor.

204
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:26,181
"Let him have a look at the matter."
I mean, oh, dear.

205
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,851
With those uniforms you look
more British than the Guard.

206
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,525
No one will stop you once
you are out of the gate.

207
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,981
It's our Scottish contact.

208
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,177
He'll be waiting for Hochbauer
and Schmidt on the Glenfoyle Road.

209
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,685
Good.

210
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,591
B is for Berlin and breakout.

211
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,321
What did Berlin say?

212
00:22:13,465 --> 00:22:16,366
English.
It wasn't Berlin.

213
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,596
It was our friend
here in Scotland...

214
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,661
and he agrees to
an earlier meeting with you.

215
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,004
Let's raise a little hell when
Perry tries to put on the handcuffs...

216
00:22:24,076 --> 00:22:27,102
and you can march straight off
and join the British army.

217
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:35,350
We used to have picnics here
when I first came. It was grand.

218
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:39,789
They were so lonely, the German lads,
and they were so nice.

219
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,727
Then they made the rule, I guess.
Closed the camp tight.

220
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,965
When was that?

221
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,524
About a year ago,
when the headmaster came.

222
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,730
Uh, the Major.
Major Perry, that is.

223
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:57,969
When Major Perry came, sir.

224
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,791
You're a bunch of weaklings.

225
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,737
Now it's the Lufwaffe's turn.

226
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,643
Good morning, Captain Schleutter.

227
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:38,808
Thank you for the list
you sent me this morning.

228
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:41,876
But there are others of us
who speak excellent English.

229
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:43,951
Your English is excellent, Kranz.

230
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,156
The tunnel was begun
before you came here.

231
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:50,490
Your list, the 28 men who are to escape,
are all U-boat men.

232
00:23:50,562 --> 00:23:53,087
None of my men.
None of Unger's engineers.

233
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:59,900
I took the tunnel over
on orders from Hitler and Doenitz.

234
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:08,538
In order to get skilled U-boat men
back into the war.

235
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,444
Germany must have them now.

236
00:24:10,682 --> 00:24:12,809
I understand, but my men
want some explanation.

237
00:24:12,884 --> 00:24:16,980
You're a Luftwaffe Commandant.
Do you explain orders?

238
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:21,082
I want some explanation about the
way you treated Neuchl.

239
00:24:22,427 --> 00:24:27,524
That flying fairy, Hauptman,
he's a bad German.

240
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:42,005
Yes, I've spent a very decent
holiday or two in lreland.

241
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,914
What made you decide to suspend
the outside privileges for the Germans?

242
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:49,977
I felt that my predecessor had taken
too many liberties with regulations.

243
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,322
As a matter of fact,
Von Westhofen agreed with me--

244
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:57,452
the German senior officer in the camp
until his death last April.

245
00:24:57,529 --> 00:25:00,293
Nice old boy,
General Von Westhofen.

246
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,162
A great feeling for books.

247
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,698
Complete opposite of the young devil now
in command. You've heard of Schleutter?

248
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,899
Yes. What did the
nice old boy die of?

249
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:11,943
- A natural death?
- Heart attack.

250
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,878
Morning.

251
00:25:23,955 --> 00:25:27,447
Captain Connor's
been sent up from London.

252
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:31,189
He's to assist me
in analyzing the problems here.

253
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,368
When are you goin' to lift
your 48-hour siege, sir?

254
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:47,377
Tomorrow morning at reveille.

255
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,516
- Let's have a look inside then.
- I think not, Captain.

256
00:25:53,585 --> 00:25:55,917
It would weaken the effect
of the punishment.

257
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:57,921
I should have a look around.

258
00:25:59,324 --> 00:26:02,555
Captain, 12 men were seriously
injured in there yesterday.

259
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:04,959
If you go in,
it's your responsibility.

260
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,554
Yes, sir.

261
00:26:07,866 --> 00:26:10,266
- Does that phone go to all the towers?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:11,927
Excuse me.

263
00:26:19,144 --> 00:26:21,078
This is Captain Connor speaking.

264
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,007
I'm comin' inside now.

265
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:29,549
Will you come along, Mr. Cox?

266
00:26:39,364 --> 00:26:41,093
Reinforcements - one more man!

267
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,371
Looks like we have company.

268
00:27:37,922 --> 00:27:41,858
What do you suppose
Von Westhofen died of, Mr. Cox?

269
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,827
I expect it was
as Major Perry said, sir.

270
00:27:44,896 --> 00:27:47,023
I'd like your opinion on that.

271
00:27:47,098 --> 00:27:50,033
Well, he always seemed
in the best of health to me, sir.

272
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:55,637
You think Schleutter
got rid of him?

273
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,733
The bastard has control now.
That's all I know.

274
00:28:03,748 --> 00:28:06,342
- Have you had any escapes?
- A few.

275
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:09,581
Most of them get picked up
in the local whorehouse.

276
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,421
A couple did make it across
to the lrish Free State.

277
00:28:13,491 --> 00:28:17,359
Hell, you say.
Horrible place to wind up.

278
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,221
There's only one way
to handle prisoners, sir.

279
00:28:21,099 --> 00:28:23,294
Lock 'em up someplace so tight...

280
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:26,701
that all they can do
is eat, sleep and shit.

281
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,240
But the Geneva Convention
wouldn't abide it.

282
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,391
Do they have any workshops?

283
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:50,758
They can make almost
anything you care to name.

284
00:28:50,829 --> 00:28:54,196
Made uniforms as good as new
for their top officers.

285
00:28:54,265 --> 00:28:58,167
They've got the lot:
tinkers, tailors.

286
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:01,728
-Candlestick makers, I shouldn't wonder.
-Did they make any guns yet?

287
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:05,708
We search, we try to surprise them.
We find nothing.

288
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,975
It turns out
we always get the surprises.

289
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:12,448
- Is that Schleutter?
- Ay, number one barracks.

290
00:29:12,517 --> 00:29:14,849
To be sure.

291
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:23,884
"Quiet Willi."

292
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,125
His men aren't so quiet, though.
He's seen to that.

293
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:30,861
He's got more authority here
than he ever had on a U-boat.

294
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:34,462
I heard about his playin'
at war games yesterday.

295
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:37,474
- Exciting, was it?
- You're dead right, sir.

296
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,978
That's the mess hall up there.
Around the corner is the cooler.

297
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:43,912
The Major hasn't made
enough use of it yet, sir.

298
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,455
Are you irritated by this lot?

299
00:29:51,523 --> 00:29:54,617
- I could do without them, sir.
- Quick march, then.

300
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:36,996
That's lovely topsoil, Willi.

301
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,564
Were you satisfied with
your turnip inspection, Captain?

302
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,609
Just grand.

303
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,941
You're not puttin' the dirt
from your tunnel there, are you?

304
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,380
Tunnel?
You're old-fashioned, Captain.

305
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,010
That's right.

306
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,520
Yes, there must be
a better way than that.

307
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,801
Attention, please.

308
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,803
This is Major Perry.

309
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:17,870
I am assigning Captain Connor officer
in charge of roll call tomorrow morning.

310
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:22,344
He will supervise
the selection and handcuffing...

311
00:31:22,413 --> 00:31:26,042
of 25 German officers
immediately after roll call.

312
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,880
Thank you.

313
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,091
There must be a better way.

314
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,374
We keep this entrance
from N.2. barracks clear...

315
00:31:53,444 --> 00:31:55,105
...since it is the main escape hatch.

316
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,838
If you will follow me to No.3.

317
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,483
You can inspect the Attic there.

318
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,561
Careful climbing through
the latrine closet.

319
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:19,432
There is no light until the Attic.

320
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:36,346
I have calculated the load
on the ceiling.

321
00:32:37,155 --> 00:32:39,453
We have 17,000 cubic centimeters
of dirt.

322
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:43,586
I've installed cable supports...

323
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:47,688
...crude but effective.

324
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,615
It's difficult with
the advanced schedule.

325
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:14,118
We don't have the incentive
of being among those to escape.

326
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,326
Of course solving the problem
is incentive enough for me.

327
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:26,130
I am an engineer.

328
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,930
Be a fast engineer, Unger.

329
00:33:52,096 --> 00:33:54,360
We are five meters from the fence...

330
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,859
...and 26 meters from the stream.

331
00:34:00,838 --> 00:34:05,537
We will have to use the roof space
in Barracks 2.

332
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,346
Barracks 3 will soon be filled.

333
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:14,513
- Good evening, Mr. Cox.
- Good evening, sir.

334
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:18,043
- You ordered reveille at 0600 hours.
- That's right.

335
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:20,818
And C Company to fall out
with 25 handcuffs.

336
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,883
Right.

337
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,622
And call the fire brigade,
will you?

338
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:27,630
- Fire brigade.
- Sir.

339
00:34:46,818 --> 00:34:49,218
Divide them between
the front two ranks.

340
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:51,221
Two to each rank.

341
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,634
Half left, wheel.

342
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,811
Right wheel!

343
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:55,281
This is Captain Connor speaking.

344
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,015
To all prisoners:
There'll be immediate roll call.

345
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:04,021
I repeat: There'll be an immediate
roll call and 25 men will be handcuffed.

346
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,131
Enter the barracks
as previously instructed.

347
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,760
Move!

348
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,951
Nobody here, sir. Dead empty.
Mother Hubbard.

349
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,495
Same here, sir.

350
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,457
Proceed with caution.

351
00:36:44,435 --> 00:36:47,802
Six men to hut two.
On the double!

352
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,420
Move in quickly.

353
00:37:21,505 --> 00:37:22,437
Get back!

354
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:29,136
You don't have to make it
look this realistic.

355
00:37:35,286 --> 00:37:36,514
Take it easy,
you don't have to kill me.

356
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,316
Hey, you two men!

357
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:39,447
Get back!

358
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:43,059
Good, now get in there
and mix with the British.

359
00:37:46,063 --> 00:37:48,327
Jerry's taking the bait.

360
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:03,806
Watch out, the swines have called
the Fire Brigade.

361
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:05,341
Hurry.

362
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,023
Mr. Cox, turn it on!

363
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:41,408
It's time for the Luftwaffe.
Get Neuchl.

364
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,077
Four men with me.

365
00:41:41,198 --> 00:41:42,529
Get that man!

366
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:08,048
Handcuff the bastards.

367
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,832
Mr. Cox, that'll do.

368
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:29,407
Off!

369
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,811
You seem to have won
an argument over handcuffs, Captain.

370
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:42,820
And you got all wet, Willi.

371
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:45,589
Have your men out in one hour
for roll call.

372
00:42:46,864 --> 00:42:50,425
I insist on visiting
your infirmary immediately...

373
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:52,469
to see to the condition of my men.

374
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,803
Right after the roll call, Willi.

375
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:24,930
- And speak English.
- Okay.

376
00:43:25,002 --> 00:43:28,631
I'm glad to be out too. But we
have to find our chum in Cathness.

377
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:35,674
What the hell is he sayin'?

378
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:39,715
I think he's unconscious, sir.

379
00:43:43,587 --> 00:43:45,578
When he comes around
I want to talk to him.

380
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:47,715
- Do whatever you have to.
- Do my best.

381
00:43:52,062 --> 00:43:55,498
That man's in a very bad way.
Our chaps didn't have to go that far.

382
00:43:55,566 --> 00:43:57,659
It wasn't them
that did it to him.

383
00:43:57,735 --> 00:44:00,533
It was his own lot.
Damn near killed him.

384
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,473
Working off some
private grudge, perhaps.

385
00:44:04,541 --> 00:44:06,270
Sir, this just came.

386
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:10,837
Keep a close guard on him, Sergeant.
I don't want anyone near him.

387
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:12,404
- Captain Connor.
- Sir.

388
00:44:16,086 --> 00:44:18,020
The Germans have taken
the handcuffs off our men.

389
00:44:18,088 --> 00:44:21,489
- Yes, I knew about that.
- You knew?

390
00:44:21,558 --> 00:44:24,322
I knew before I left London.

391
00:44:24,395 --> 00:44:26,329
Then those men
must be unshackled at once.

392
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:28,388
Not just yet, sir.

393
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:33,196
Captain, I'm instructed to cooperate
with you, not relinquish my command.

394
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,204
Not at all, sir.

395
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:39,174
But you see, you must comply with
what the lntelligence mission requires.

396
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:43,111
And I didn't come here
just to put down a riot.

397
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:47,583
Are you formally requesting me
to contravene the Geneva Convention?

398
00:44:48,786 --> 00:44:50,845
For a few hours is all.

399
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,014
Very well, Captain Connor.

400
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:56,753
I'm sure today's episode
can only redound to your credit.

401
00:44:58,062 --> 00:44:59,051
Sir.

402
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,936
I want a complete list
of the numbers and injuries to our men.

403
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:27,049
Eighty present and correct, sir.

404
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,285
Carry on, Sergeant.

405
00:45:55,786 --> 00:46:00,280
Sir, checked parade four.
All present and accounted for.

406
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:02,655
Parade, dismiss!

407
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,675
I have permission to check
on the condition of my men.

408
00:46:20,744 --> 00:46:23,008
Yes, sir.
Go inside, please.

409
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,678
These look like knife cuts.

410
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:29,184
He lost a lot of blood.
Put him to bed.

411
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:44,666
Where's Neuchl?

412
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:46,430
In that little room.

413
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:52,834
- Does the music bother you, sir?
- Not at all.

414
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:57,404
It's a therapy, of course, sir.
Germans are fond of this kind of thing.

415
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,915
I've always collected
classical music because--

416
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:08,148
Have you any of that
medical brandy?

417
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:09,817
Y es, sir.

418
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,289
Will you have a drink, Captain?

419
00:47:14,364 --> 00:47:17,424
Do I understand you refuse me
the right to see one of my men?

420
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:22,330
- Just the one brandy, Corporal, please.
- Y es, sir.

421
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:25,671
Well, he doesn't seem
to be too anxious to see you.

422
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,771
He got away from those
brutes of yours, didn't he?

423
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:33,707
They nearly killed him.

424
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:36,082
He's under the care
of the chief surgeon.

425
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:41,682
You lrish are
just fabulous, Captain.

426
00:47:41,758 --> 00:47:46,354
You really have got that
famous lrish imagination.

427
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:50,389
But your water sports this morning
made such a confusion.

428
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,401
Who knows what you saw?

429
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:56,768
I know what I saw.
I saw a man tryin' to escape.

430
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:00,065
I'm not contradicting you
really, Captain.

431
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:03,510
You may have seen
an attempted escape.

432
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,741
Is it not the duty
of all prisoners to try?

433
00:48:06,917 --> 00:48:09,215
- Sir.
- Thank you, Corporal.

434
00:48:15,859 --> 00:48:17,292
Toscanini?

435
00:48:19,363 --> 00:48:21,729
Furtwangler does it better.

436
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:36,575
By the way, the German camps have taken
the shackles off the British prisoners.

437
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:39,241
And we shall reciprocate very soon.

438
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:49,184
Of course, your lads
did quite a bit of damage.

439
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,955
We'll have to deduct that
from their pay.

440
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,757
And that will be all
for now, Captain.

441
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:57,595
You'll want to see your men.

442
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:01,968
And Captain,
deduct the damages from my pay.

443
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:05,031
- Thank you.
- You've done too much as it is.

444
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,715
Keep your eye on that one.
See that he leaves soon.

445
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,192
And don't let anyone else in
without my authorization.

446
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,070
There they are.

447
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:37,732
Take these books to the prisoners.
I've inspected them.

448
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:43,979
This is all the Kriegsmariners?

449
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:46,447
Y es. I separated them.

450
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:49,451
I don't read German all that well.

451
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:51,510
I don't even know
what the hell I'm lookin' for.

452
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:54,523
- What's that?
- Ewigkeit.

453
00:49:57,227 --> 00:50:00,128
"My dear wife,
it has seemed like an eternity...

454
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:03,166
since last I kissed your bosom...

455
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:05,667
and slept with my arms entwined...

456
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:08,330
around your body."

457
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:10,839
You read these
horny letters all day?

458
00:50:10,907 --> 00:50:13,501
-That's the function of the post office.
-lt is?

459
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:18,103
"The turnip fields
are growing, dear...

460
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:22,675
and we are going to do
several plays by Shakespeare.

461
00:50:22,753 --> 00:50:27,656
I wish I had you with me now to put
my arms around and feel your bosom."

462
00:50:27,724 --> 00:50:30,022
Bosom, bosom, bosom.

463
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:33,062
Why do they put that
Roman numeral in the date?

464
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:36,429
- What date?
- The date has a Roman numeral in it.

465
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:39,401
- You ever notice that?
- I never noticed that before.

466
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:43,734
He's got that queer little
German seven...

467
00:50:43,807 --> 00:50:48,244
and the one and the two,
but it starts off with a Roman numeral.

468
00:50:49,346 --> 00:50:53,214
We're gonna get us a code man
down here from London...

469
00:50:53,283 --> 00:50:55,877
and have him take a look
at these horny letters.

470
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,000
Get back to bed!
Do you hear me?

471
00:51:42,566 --> 00:51:45,592
Look out! They've got a hostage!
Get back to your beds immediately!

472
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:15,692
Have I kept you waitin', Willi?

473
00:52:15,765 --> 00:52:19,292
It's your prison, Captain.
We follow your orders.

474
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:23,169
You have imposed
your kind of order, haven't you?

475
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,708
- Did you know him well?
- No.

476
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,834
What's his name?
You know that.

477
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,936
Rupert Neuchl.

478
00:52:30,013 --> 00:52:32,538
You have it on your
hospital report.

479
00:52:32,616 --> 00:52:35,881
I mean, he must have regained
consciousness during the day.

480
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:38,284
He hanged himself.

481
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,290
Do you want to write that
to his family, or should I do it?

482
00:52:41,358 --> 00:52:44,088
It won't be necessary.

483
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:46,925
- Why'd he hang himself?
- He was weak.

484
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:49,659
He was a homosexual.
Why do you ask me?

485
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:53,692
We asked everyone else in the ward.
They didn't see anything, of course.

486
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,762
You're the commanding officer.
Why'd he die?

487
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,774
Captain, he died
under your custody.

488
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:05,511
I smell cognac, I think.

489
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,682
You smell lrish whiskey, I think.

490
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:11,186
- There you are.
- Thank you.

491
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,931
It's a pity the corpse
never enjoys the wake.

492
00:53:27,904 --> 00:53:31,067
A hell of a nice fellow
to talk to, though.

493
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,608
Here's to you, Rupert.

494
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:39,543
Your German--
you're pronouncing it very good today.

495
00:53:39,616 --> 00:53:43,211
You're pronouncin'
your English very good too.

496
00:53:43,286 --> 00:53:45,379
Where'd you learn English, Willi?

497
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:48,083
Bremen UnterZeeboot Academie,
ten years ago.

498
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,457
- How old are you?
- Twenty-seven.

499
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:57,892
You must've had a couple of years in the
Hitler Youth Camp then, with some luck.

500
00:53:59,002 --> 00:54:01,027
A lot of luck.

501
00:54:01,104 --> 00:54:03,038
Two years.

502
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,675
And you?

503
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:08,301
Me what?

504
00:54:08,378 --> 00:54:12,474
- I mean, how old?
- I'm 44.

505
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:17,082
- Still very much alive.
- I'm quite well, thanks.

506
00:54:17,153 --> 00:54:19,348
I mean, your new command
is very much impressed.

507
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:22,357
One of those nice elderly
British guards told me today...

508
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,359
you were a hell of a journalist.

509
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:28,557
That's true. I'm a hell of a journalist.
I could make you famous, Willi.

510
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:31,658
Now why don't you tell the lively old
crime reporter why the man's dead?

511
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,463
You expect me to tell you
that I killed him, and why?

512
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:41,443
No, you don't have to.

513
00:54:41,511 --> 00:54:43,502
I can see your pleasure
in the kill.

514
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,883
Can you?

515
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:54,989
Perhaps you can see somebody
who believes in the war...

516
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:58,494
who believes in his people,
his leaders.

517
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:01,189
We kill in a war
for those things, huh?

518
00:55:02,332 --> 00:55:04,357
But maybe you don't.

519
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:09,235
I mean, you're lrish and
you're a captain in the British army.

520
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:13,970
That same British army that has killed
your own lrish people for centuries.

521
00:55:14,044 --> 00:55:16,478
What do you really believe in?
What kind of order?

522
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,480
What laws do you obey?

523
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:25,186
Well, I obey
as few laws as I have to.

524
00:55:25,255 --> 00:55:28,691
And I'm not much
of a one for order.

525
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:33,224
It has to be, I suppose...

526
00:55:33,296 --> 00:55:36,732
but there's order
and then there's order, isn't there?

527
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:41,904
Death is a kind of order,
isn't it?

528
00:55:43,540 --> 00:55:46,475
I mean, Neuchl there,
he's all in order now.

529
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:51,671
But, Willi, that's an awful
lot of shit about your people.

530
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,512
You've killed two of them
that I know of.

531
00:55:55,652 --> 00:55:57,085
That's not true.

532
00:55:57,153 --> 00:56:00,213
You killed him and you probably killed
your commanding officer as well.

533
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,123
And for that
I'm goin' to see you hang.

534
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,731
You enjoy killing too, huh?

535
00:56:14,337 --> 00:56:17,864
- Mr. Cox.
- Do you not, Captain Connor?

536
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:23,373
See that the Captain's escorted
back to his quarters, if you please.

537
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:50,839
Gate, gentlemen!

538
00:57:09,292 --> 00:57:12,193
Connor wants me to think
that Neuchl told him something.

539
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:14,430
I don't think it was much.
I'm not sure.

540
00:57:15,064 --> 00:57:17,828
'28 Submariners' Connor said to me
in German.

541
00:57:17,901 --> 00:57:18,731
My God!

542
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:23,798
He will do nothing for the moment.

543
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:26,537
But he'll try to prove
I killed Neuchl.

544
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:29,974
Meanwhile we go ahead of schedule.

545
00:57:31,347 --> 00:57:33,338
Hochbauer and Schmidt
won't be back until Friday.

546
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:36,647
The tunnel won't reach the stream
for five days.

547
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:42,715
Tell Unger not to go to the stream.

548
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:46,424
Divert and go under the Guard house.

549
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:51,765
It's much shorter.

550
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:55,100
Don't let the men know it.

551
00:57:56,206 --> 00:57:57,503
Go ahead of schedule.

552
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:23,765
That's our contact.

553
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:27,903
Can I give you boys a lift?

554
00:58:27,971 --> 00:58:30,599
What are they writing
home about, Lieutenant?

555
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:32,106
I can't really tell yet.

556
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,838
It's a question of assembling
the basic code pattern. As you see--

557
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:38,676
- When will you know anything?
- Hard to say.

558
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:41,182
Could be a day, could be a week
if there are variations.

559
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:45,347
But we don't have to wait for a decoded
message to know that we have trouble.

560
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:48,151
Obviously Schleutter's
at the center of it.

561
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:50,158
We must transfer him to Blackpool.

562
00:58:50,226 --> 00:58:53,855
- I need him here a bit longer.
- You need him?

563
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:58,526
He's at the center, but of what?
I can't find out if he's in Blackpool.

564
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:13,954
You must block the old tunnel and
be as quick as you can with this one.

565
00:59:18,764 --> 00:59:21,164
Lousy work but necessary.

566
01:01:42,274 --> 01:01:45,141
Have you met any resistance
in the barracks, Mr. Cox?

567
01:01:46,445 --> 01:01:47,776
Nothing? Good.

568
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:51,010
Well, inform me directly
if anything at all happens.

569
01:01:51,083 --> 01:01:52,914
Y es. Thank you, Sergeant Major.

570
01:01:52,985 --> 01:01:57,183
Come in, Captain Connor. I think
you ought to know we're onto something.

571
01:01:57,256 --> 01:01:59,190
Thank you.

572
01:01:59,258 --> 01:02:03,251
It appears that 28 submariners
are due to escape.

573
01:02:03,329 --> 01:02:05,229
There's a U-boat coming
to pick them up.

574
01:02:05,297 --> 01:02:08,733
"U-841 available. Assign 28 men.
Location, date agreeable."

575
01:02:08,801 --> 01:02:11,998
- What's the location and date?
- We checked all the letters.

576
01:02:12,071 --> 01:02:15,734
Specific time must've been set before
in something they received earlier.

577
01:02:15,808 --> 01:02:18,743
It doesn't matter.
We'll move in now and break it up.

578
01:02:18,811 --> 01:02:22,804
There's got to be a tunnel. We'll pull
every barracks apart until we find it.

579
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:27,808
Lieutenant, could you excuse us
a minute, please?

580
01:02:27,887 --> 01:02:31,345
Go and have a cup of coffee
or something.

581
01:02:44,136 --> 01:02:46,502
What if we were to let 'em go?

582
01:02:46,572 --> 01:02:51,066
Then we could follow and find out where
the rendezvous is and land the sub.

583
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:53,703
How'd Willi like that?

584
01:02:53,779 --> 01:02:55,144
Permit the escape?

585
01:02:55,881 --> 01:02:59,214
The tunnel's got to come up
within 50 yards of that fence.

586
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:03,312
All we have to do is put patrols
out there, see where they come through.

587
01:03:04,323 --> 01:03:06,257
We keep radio contact.

588
01:03:07,960 --> 01:03:11,828
Then we inform the military and civilian
police all the way out to the coast.

589
01:03:13,098 --> 01:03:16,329
Then we nab the sub
and the whole lot.

590
01:03:16,402 --> 01:03:19,997
My job is to run this camp
and account for the prisoners in it.

591
01:03:20,072 --> 01:03:23,371
And curiously enough that doesn't
include letting 28 of them escape...

592
01:03:23,442 --> 01:03:26,172
to further your military career,
Captain.

593
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:31,844
Under my instructions at this moment,
our men are searching German barracks.

594
01:03:33,352 --> 01:03:36,344
- Perry.
- It's Major Perry, Captain!

595
01:03:36,422 --> 01:03:38,890
I'm your superior officer
and you will respect the rank.

596
01:03:38,958 --> 01:03:42,291
I don't give a damn about
your bloody rank, or anyone else's.

597
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,886
I got sent up here to do a job.

598
01:03:44,964 --> 01:03:47,899
I'm supposed to find out
what's behind that break.

599
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:51,698
If you don't like what I'm doing, call
General Kerr and have him relieve me.

600
01:03:54,773 --> 01:03:57,207
Now bring the men back
and stop that search.

601
01:03:59,378 --> 01:04:02,643
The War Office has given you
a unique authority here.

602
01:04:03,782 --> 01:04:06,376
I suppose I must yield to it.

603
01:04:06,452 --> 01:04:09,387
Even though I believe you
to be mistaken and an arrogant fool.

604
01:04:12,324 --> 01:04:14,884
I'll give the order, Captain.

605
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,554
Then I'll phone London
and have them remove one of us...

606
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:19,689
from this intolerable situation.

607
01:04:37,016 --> 01:04:39,951
Search has been called off.
Everything back.

608
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:44,019
Why give up the search, Captain?

609
01:04:44,089 --> 01:04:48,287
Sir! There's something in here
you ought to see, sir.

610
01:04:58,170 --> 01:05:00,434
And this one's just been sick, sir.

611
01:05:04,009 --> 01:05:06,569
Mr. Cashman, we'll have a roll call.

612
01:05:06,645 --> 01:05:08,909
Yes, sir.
Carry on, Sergeant.

613
01:05:11,617 --> 01:05:14,347
- How long have they been away with--
- Who?

614
01:05:16,155 --> 01:05:18,214
I want the names
of these two that escaped.

615
01:05:18,290 --> 01:05:20,349
Sorry. I didn't know them
personally.

616
01:05:24,730 --> 01:05:26,994
Seal off the barracks
until further orders.

617
01:05:31,971 --> 01:05:34,462
It's very likely to be
a long roll call, Willi.

618
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:51,780
Submarines do well in water,
not the Luftwaffe.

619
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:56,183
Give it up, Schluetter.

620
01:07:15,908 --> 01:07:17,569
17 hours.

621
01:07:17,643 --> 01:07:21,409
The truck will be
close enough to signal.

622
01:07:21,947 --> 01:07:23,471
You mean to go tonight?

623
01:07:43,068 --> 01:07:44,763
Soldier!

624
01:07:44,837 --> 01:07:47,829
I want to speak
to Sergeant Major Cox.

625
01:07:53,745 --> 01:07:56,270
Captain Schleutter gave us the names
of the two men who escaped.

626
01:07:56,348 --> 01:07:59,875
He's instructed his men
to stand by for roll call.

627
01:08:03,155 --> 01:08:06,352
Why the hell does he bother
to knuckle under now?

628
01:08:06,425 --> 01:08:08,916
I'll get identifications
on the wire, sir.

629
01:08:08,994 --> 01:08:12,486
Guards. Open the barracks and
let the bastards in out of the rain.

630
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:20,802
It's been an uncomfortable day
gentlemen.

631
01:08:21,874 --> 01:08:23,273
Dry off.

632
01:08:23,342 --> 01:08:29,372
You never stop, eh Captain?

633
01:08:30,082 --> 01:08:33,017
What are your plans for tomorrow?

634
01:08:33,085 --> 01:08:38,079
First a meal and dreams
of warm women.

635
01:08:40,926 --> 01:08:44,794
The damn fool doesn't care
if we all get pneumonia.

636
01:08:44,863 --> 01:08:46,296
Shut up!

637
01:08:46,465 --> 01:08:49,025
Don't hang yourself like Neuchl.

638
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:03,945
Tell the men that we go
right after lights out.

639
01:09:04,516 --> 01:09:06,746
We should wait until Connor
is less alert.

640
01:09:07,019 --> 01:09:08,316
We don't have to go tonight.

641
01:09:08,654 --> 01:09:10,519
Connor will have this hands full
in this barracks tonight.

642
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:14,918
We meet in No. 2 barracks
an hour after lights out.

643
01:09:38,850 --> 01:09:39,874
Are we going to make it?

644
01:09:40,419 --> 01:09:43,320
We've almost finished.

645
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:46,956
The rain has put a bad strain
on the support.

646
01:09:48,594 --> 01:09:50,619
We'll be alright, I'm sure.

647
01:11:06,571 --> 01:11:08,835
Pour us a drink, Mr. Cox.

648
01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:15,738
Take some of that from the stores
and give it to the lads outside.

649
01:11:15,814 --> 01:11:19,079
Thank you, sir.
The old sweats'll appreciate that.

650
01:11:23,422 --> 01:11:26,220
In the morning get me that friend
of Neuchl's-- what's his name--

651
01:11:26,291 --> 01:11:28,020
Lieutenant Berger.

652
01:12:40,832 --> 01:12:42,026
Help!

653
01:13:11,563 --> 01:13:16,466
Guards! Come on out of there!
Come on. Move, move!

654
01:13:16,535 --> 01:13:20,801
Let's have you!
Go look on the other side!

655
01:13:20,872 --> 01:13:22,464
Come on!

656
01:13:27,312 --> 01:13:30,008
- Which one?
- I don't know.

657
01:13:31,616 --> 01:13:33,777
Hello, towers. Which one?

658
01:13:33,919 --> 01:13:37,377
Barracks three. Looks like
the whole damned thing caved in.

659
01:13:37,456 --> 01:13:39,117
Thanks.

660
01:13:53,939 --> 01:13:55,531
Bloody hell!

661
01:13:59,077 --> 01:14:02,979
Come on. Out of the bloody way!
Move! Out! Out!

662
01:14:04,616 --> 01:14:07,210
Right. Let's get through
this rubbish.

663
01:14:12,457 --> 01:14:14,220
What are you looking at?
Get moving.

664
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:28,969
Go - quietly - Go!

665
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:59,930
Patrols Able, Baker, Charlie, keep in
radio contact with me and the main gate.

666
01:15:05,043 --> 01:15:06,977
Give us an axe.

667
01:15:08,113 --> 01:15:11,048
Get an axe and smash
the other door down.

668
01:15:13,818 --> 01:15:16,378
Get this lot back in their beds
and count 'em.

669
01:15:16,454 --> 01:15:19,150
Get the men back to their beds
for a check.

670
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,562
Now Holtz - collapse it!

671
01:16:04,636 --> 01:16:07,127
Clumsy idiot, you could have
killed us all.

672
01:16:20,719 --> 01:16:22,983
Six dead so far, sir.

673
01:16:24,489 --> 01:16:26,548
Find the damned tunnel.

674
01:17:34,893 --> 01:17:37,919
- What the hell's going on now?
- I don't exactly know, sir.

675
01:17:37,996 --> 01:17:41,329
- Number three's roof's collapsed.
- The roof's collapsed?

676
01:17:41,399 --> 01:17:42,764
Y es, sir.

677
01:17:42,834 --> 01:17:44,893
Captain Connor's up there now, sir.

678
01:17:44,969 --> 01:17:48,928
Is he? Has he checked round
his exterior patrols?

679
01:17:49,007 --> 01:17:51,999
- Not as far as I know, sir.
- Do that now.

680
01:17:52,077 --> 01:17:53,806
Drive on.

681
01:18:12,497 --> 01:18:14,158
You men get the stretcher.

682
01:20:15,620 --> 01:20:18,020
I'll see if they've got
the count, sir.

683
01:20:23,828 --> 01:20:27,764
Sergeant, get back down to the main gate
and get a three-tonner here for wounded.

684
01:20:27,832 --> 01:20:30,767
- Have you got the count yet?
- Not yet, Major.

685
01:20:50,121 --> 01:20:52,055
Only ten dead, Connor.

686
01:20:56,594 --> 01:20:59,290
Thirty-seven not accounted for.

687
01:21:00,698 --> 01:21:03,326
I think we've located
the tunnel, sir.

688
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:13,544
Hold it. It's collapsed.

689
01:21:22,987 --> 01:21:24,648
Yes, sir. Ten dead.

690
01:21:24,722 --> 01:21:27,691
Another 27 trapped
when the tunnel collapsed.

691
01:21:27,759 --> 01:21:30,159
Presumably Captain Schleutter
was with them.

692
01:21:31,362 --> 01:21:34,388
No, sir. It'll take
several hours of digging.

693
01:21:34,465 --> 01:21:38,731
It needn't have happened. I'm sending
you a complete report in a few hours.

694
01:21:40,705 --> 01:21:43,469
No, sir. He hasn't
accomplished a thing.

695
01:21:43,541 --> 01:21:46,476
You may inform General Kerr that
Captain Connor's mission here...

696
01:21:46,544 --> 01:21:49,069
has been a fatal mistake.

697
01:21:50,915 --> 01:21:52,280
Good night, sir.

698
01:22:26,551 --> 01:22:30,009
Nothing, sir.
Not a bloody one of them!

699
01:22:36,627 --> 01:22:38,891
Base Station Five.
This is Connor.

700
01:22:40,465 --> 01:22:42,899
Give us a police frequency.

701
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:52,641
Roadblock in position on A85.

702
01:22:54,579 --> 01:22:58,447
Police report no suspicious traffic
on the B828...

703
01:22:58,516 --> 01:23:00,746
and continue mobile patrols north.

704
01:23:01,652 --> 01:23:03,813
All units.

705
01:23:03,888 --> 01:23:07,688
Per the McKenzie break, escaped
prisoners should be considered armed.

706
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:13,463
All units station traffic,
please copy.

707
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:18,030
Northeast of Perth and Aberfeldy...

708
01:23:18,102 --> 01:23:19,626
east to Dunfermline...

709
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:21,535
south to Falkirk...

710
01:23:21,606 --> 01:23:25,098
southwest to Glasgow,
west to lnverary.

711
01:23:25,176 --> 01:23:28,942
The following roadblocks will go
into effect in the immediate area--

712
01:23:29,013 --> 01:23:32,847
Number 33 between McKenzie
and Stirling.

713
01:23:48,332 --> 01:23:51,893
This is Glengarry police.

714
01:23:51,969 --> 01:23:56,065
We require extra mobiles
to maintain watch on coast road.

715
01:23:56,140 --> 01:23:57,732
Glengarry police, over.

716
01:24:00,678 --> 01:24:02,612
North Shore coast guards.

717
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,205
Coastal Command.

718
01:24:05,283 --> 01:24:07,945
We have no response
from northern moorland's road net.

719
01:24:08,019 --> 01:24:10,886
Presumably still in effect
from the Southern Lochs...

720
01:24:10,955 --> 01:24:13,219
as far north as Loch Glenny.

721
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:20,060
Case section at Clough here.
All units please reply.

722
01:24:20,131 --> 01:24:22,065
Please, repeat, all units.

723
01:24:22,133 --> 01:24:25,068
- Sir! General Kerr's arrived.
- Oh, God.

724
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:33,776
- What happened?
- Balls-up, sir. Simple as that.

725
01:24:33,845 --> 01:24:35,608
Nothing simple about it.

726
01:24:35,680 --> 01:24:38,205
Worse than what happened at
Bowmanville Camp in Canada last year...

727
01:24:38,282 --> 01:24:41,308
and Whitehall thought
that was a disaster.

728
01:24:41,385 --> 01:24:43,751
Perry's made a full report
to top staff.

729
01:24:43,821 --> 01:24:46,153
I don't blame him.
I could have prevented it.

730
01:24:46,224 --> 01:24:50,422
That's dead right. Now,
let's get back, shall we, old chap?

731
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:02,833
I don't care what
the priority classification is.

732
01:25:02,907 --> 01:25:05,137
I want three more aircraft.

733
01:25:05,209 --> 01:25:07,143
You're damned right I do.

734
01:25:08,946 --> 01:25:11,380
Coastal Command say there
are several thousand miles...

735
01:25:11,449 --> 01:25:14,043
of naturally camouflaged coastline
around Scotland...

736
01:25:14,118 --> 01:25:16,052
and how in the hell
can they cover it all.

737
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:19,021
Northern moorlands road net--
nothing.

738
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:21,957
There's another call for you, sir.

739
01:25:26,030 --> 01:25:29,625
I'm afraid it's essential
to use civilian police, sir.

740
01:25:54,725 --> 01:25:57,023
- lmportant?
- Aye.

741
01:25:57,094 --> 01:25:59,358
Go ahead.

742
01:26:17,315 --> 01:26:19,306
There's a truck on the A828.

743
01:26:19,383 --> 01:26:22,318
Explosives with a police motorcycle
escorting it.

744
01:26:29,427 --> 01:26:32,885
No, sir. Explosives are under
the ministry of Fuel and Power.

745
01:26:32,964 --> 01:26:36,058
The escort duty our men
are assigned to is never for...

746
01:26:36,133 --> 01:26:39,500
industrial or mining purposes
during wartime.

747
01:26:39,570 --> 01:26:43,199
- We never assign men for--
- Thanks very much.

748
01:27:00,024 --> 01:27:04,984
Base Section,
this is Zero 468.

749
01:27:05,062 --> 01:27:08,361
I'm over Ballachulish.
All clear, turning south.

750
01:28:14,265 --> 01:28:17,166
There's an explosives truck
with a motorcycle escort...

751
01:28:17,234 --> 01:28:20,601
heading north on Highway B828.

752
01:28:20,671 --> 01:28:22,764
Stay up there.
Don't move in close.

753
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:25,070
Roger.

754
01:28:31,415 --> 01:28:33,747
Let's lose him - turn right in here.

755
01:29:10,054 --> 01:29:14,047
They're either goin' for
the Firth of Lorne or else Loch Linnhe.

756
01:29:14,125 --> 01:29:16,423
And they're gonna lead us
right to the sub.

757
01:29:16,494 --> 01:29:19,122
Straight away. Splendid.

758
01:29:19,196 --> 01:29:22,165
It has to come to the surface
and move in to the beach, doesn't it?

759
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:24,633
Y eah, but if we miss them,
we've had it.

760
01:29:24,702 --> 01:29:26,636
Bag them now
and call that good.

761
01:29:26,704 --> 01:29:30,140
- I have lost contact with the truck.
- Ben, for God's sake.

762
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:34,173
It's the reconnaissance pilot.
He's lost contact.

763
01:30:06,243 --> 01:30:07,574
Quick - get rid of that.

764
01:30:49,453 --> 01:30:51,387
Lost contact.

765
01:30:51,455 --> 01:30:56,392
Suggest immediate police surveillance
north on Highway B828.

766
01:30:58,329 --> 01:31:01,526
- I'll get a plane myself.
- I'll arrange transport, sir.

767
01:31:36,867 --> 01:31:39,631
Where are you men going?

768
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:43,104
Just going to make
our Yank visitors comfy, Dad.

769
01:32:01,458 --> 01:32:02,925
Load of furniture...

770
01:32:02,993 --> 01:32:05,962
for the C.O. at
the new American base at Mahaddie.

771
01:32:07,698 --> 01:32:09,723
Look.

772
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:12,234
Even a shower attachment
for the silly bastard.

773
01:32:13,504 --> 01:32:15,597
It's five shillings.

774
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:19,375
Heave up the tail!
Good man.

775
01:33:03,921 --> 01:33:06,856
Won't be able to see
a bloody thing after dark.

776
01:33:50,868 --> 01:33:52,199
Look-outs up there.

777
01:34:05,082 --> 01:34:06,071
All clear.

778
01:34:06,150 --> 01:34:07,708
All clear.

779
01:34:09,887 --> 01:34:11,184
Camouflage the truck.

780
01:34:52,996 --> 01:34:57,126
This is White Lady 7.

781
01:34:57,201 --> 01:35:00,762
You are on a navy frequency, Flight 43.
I have no authorization--

782
01:35:00,838 --> 01:35:04,604
I know that. I'm just tellin' you
the sub will surface and sit there.

783
01:35:04,675 --> 01:35:07,007
Have any idea
where that might be?

784
01:35:07,077 --> 01:35:10,103
Hell, no. If I knew,
I wouldn't be guessin'.

785
01:35:23,861 --> 01:35:25,192
That's a waste of time.

786
01:35:25,262 --> 01:35:28,129
Let's drive it down this hole
and get going.

787
01:35:35,405 --> 01:35:36,497
The boats first.

788
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,605
Have you gone crazy?

789
01:36:13,343 --> 01:36:14,310
Stop the truck!

790
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,459
What the hell is going on?

791
01:36:41,471 --> 01:36:43,234
Now what the hell?

792
01:36:45,008 --> 01:36:47,738
Do you see that?
Go on down there.

793
01:37:13,637 --> 01:37:17,095
Burning rubbish I should say, sir.
No sign of anything else.

794
01:37:40,898 --> 01:37:42,195
Go on ahead.

795
01:38:02,753 --> 01:38:05,881
This is White Lady 7.

796
01:38:05,956 --> 01:38:09,392
I've just completed a sweep
of grid 16 X-ray.

797
01:38:09,459 --> 01:38:11,723
Sunset in 18 minutes.

798
01:38:11,795 --> 01:38:14,229
Will turn for home at that time.

799
01:38:14,298 --> 01:38:16,289
E.T.A., 1930.

800
01:38:16,366 --> 01:38:17,958
Out.

801
01:38:59,142 --> 01:39:03,078
We have no flight plan for you,
Flight 43. Return to base.

802
01:39:03,146 --> 01:39:07,014
- I say, you're not authorized.
- Where'd you get an idea like that?

803
01:39:07,084 --> 01:39:10,110
- Flight Control.
- They're pullin' your leg.

804
01:39:10,187 --> 01:39:14,385
Make another run offshore like
a good fellow and I'll get you a medal.

805
01:40:19,656 --> 01:40:21,351
Hurry, I'm right behind you.

806
01:40:47,818 --> 01:40:51,219
There's the sub.
Jesus, that's it!

807
01:40:51,288 --> 01:40:53,779
White Lady, this is Flight 43.

808
01:40:54,791 --> 01:40:57,487
Sub's off the point about a mile.

809
01:40:57,561 --> 01:41:00,086
About a mile!
U-boat on the surface.

810
01:41:00,163 --> 01:41:01,790
Engine, full ahead.

811
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:15,136
Go on down there.
Buzz the hell out of 'em.

812
01:42:37,427 --> 01:42:40,590
Will you get in there.
It'll submerge on you!

813
01:42:58,782 --> 01:43:03,151
Looks like we've been hit, sir.
Better find a place to put her down.

814
01:44:52,395 --> 01:44:55,523
Asdic reports lost contact with U-boat.
Request another sweep.

815
01:44:57,467 --> 01:44:59,662
This is White Lady 7 calling Madam.

816
01:45:03,073 --> 01:45:05,473
U-boat submerged 1924.

817
01:45:05,542 --> 01:45:08,602
Bearing 045 off course head point...

818
01:45:08,678 --> 01:45:11,238
and boarding four prisoners
who were abandoned.

819
01:45:11,314 --> 01:45:15,307
Will continue asdic sweep
on 19 degrees aft from grid 13 easy.

820
01:45:15,385 --> 01:45:17,046
Request assistance.

821
01:45:18,555 --> 01:45:21,080
General Kerr calling Captain Connor.

822
01:45:24,861 --> 01:45:26,158
Come in, Connor.

823
01:45:27,931 --> 01:45:32,459
This is General Kerr
calling Naval Frequency 453.

824
01:45:34,537 --> 01:45:38,132
Willi, looks like we're both
in the shit house.

825
01:45:38,208 --> 01:45:41,507
General Kerr calling Captain Connor.

826
01:45:41,578 --> 01:45:43,375
Come in, Connor.
