1
00:01:21,407 --> 00:01:23,807
Guard, halt.

2
00:01:23,876 --> 00:01:25,468
Handcuffs.

3
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,938
Left turn.

4
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,606
Corporal.

5
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,286
Come on, let's have you! Get fell in!

6
00:02:10,355 --> 00:02:13,449
It's roll call! Let's have you!

7
00:02:18,831 --> 00:02:22,232
- Sergeant, check the other huts.   - Quick march, double!

8
00:02:22,301 --> 00:02:25,031
Come on! Move! Move!

9
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:40,909
Come on! Fall out for roll call, or it's blood for breakfast!

10
00:02:40,986 --> 00:02:43,750
Kapitan Schleutter's compliments to Major Perry.

11
00:02:43,822 --> 00:02:46,086
He will speak only to the Major.

12
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:00,471
The P.A.

13
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:09,744
Captain Schleutter, your men will now fall in for roll call...

14
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:13,751
and 25 of them will be handcuffed, as previously ordered.

15
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,823
Your country started this in violating the Geneva Convention.

16
00:03:22,895 --> 00:03:25,329
Twenty-five British officers were shackled...

17
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:27,831
in Ludwigsdorf Prison in Germany.

18
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:39,842
After roll call, we must handcuff 25 of your officers...

19
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:41,846
Captain Schleutter.

20
00:03:48,954 --> 00:03:50,888
How do you plan to do that, Major?

21
00:03:50,956 --> 00:03:54,016
There are 600 of us and we don't agree.

22
00:03:55,527 --> 00:03:58,325
You leave me no alternative but to result to force.

23
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,673
Bloody man. I mean, can't he see?

24
00:05:35,227 --> 00:05:37,889
There's nothing for it.

25
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,396
- Bring 'em up.   - Yes, sir.

26
00:05:42,567 --> 00:05:45,331
Major Cox, bring those men up here.

27
00:06:13,565 --> 00:06:16,295
Squad, mark time!

28
00:06:16,368 --> 00:06:19,633
Squad, halt!

29
00:06:19,705 --> 00:06:20,637
Sir!

30
00:06:20,706 --> 00:06:23,766
Mr. Cox, enter barracks number one...

31
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,606
and place Captain Schleutter under arrest.

32
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:28,873
Y es, sir! Gates!

33
00:06:32,284 --> 00:06:34,411
Company, double march!

34
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,044
Come on, let's go!

35
00:07:06,118 --> 00:07:08,985
I want no part of this, understand?

36
00:07:09,955 --> 00:07:11,422
All guard towers...

37
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,822
this is Major Perry.

38
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,227
There is to be no shooting...

39
00:07:16,294 --> 00:07:18,819
unless a prisoner crosses the trip wire.

40
00:07:18,897 --> 00:07:21,388
Is that understood?

41
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:47,023
Cease firing.

42
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:49,026
Come out, you kraut swine!

43
00:07:52,697 --> 00:07:54,562
Why don't you come in here?!

44
00:07:58,703 --> 00:07:59,635
Bastards!

45
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,799
Gas grenades in.

46
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:16,309
Tear gas, they're past the wire.

47
00:08:39,678 --> 00:08:41,669
Come on! Double it up!

48
00:08:53,925 --> 00:08:58,521
I want 12 men. Six with me and six around the back.

49
00:08:58,597 --> 00:09:01,327
Those men, pronto! Cover the other side!

50
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,217
Drop back and form a line!

51
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:33,894
Fix bayonets!

52
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,172
All guard towers...

53
00:09:43,441 --> 00:09:46,740
there is to be no shooting unless they cross the trip wire.

54
00:09:52,984 --> 00:09:55,248
Soldiers, stand guard!

55
00:09:56,421 --> 00:09:58,048
Move it up!

56
00:10:02,494 --> 00:10:05,429
Hurry up! Get in there! Go round that side.

57
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:18,369
Is the Luftwaffe...above all this.

58
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:20,203
Come on   - get going.

59
00:10:20,812 --> 00:10:22,074
Go to the devil.

60
00:10:24,716 --> 00:10:26,775
What a bunch of idiots.

61
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:48,163
Get the Tommies out of here. Out!...Out!...Out!

62
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:51,975
Close the gates!

63
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:19,195
Send your handcuffs back to London, Major Perry.

64
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:23,139
Captain Schleutter, I'm entitled by the Geneva Convention...

65
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:26,177
to punish you and your men for this incredible behavior!

66
00:11:26,244 --> 00:11:30,943
You'll be confined to your huts on restricted diet for 48 hours!

67
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:33,678
All privileges and electric power...

68
00:11:33,752 --> 00:11:35,913
will be curtailed for that period.

69
00:11:37,622 --> 00:11:39,613
And at the end of that period...

70
00:11:39,691 --> 00:11:43,787
you will fall in for roll call in proper order.

71
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:45,796
As indeed you are now.

72
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:50,531
Send your handcuffs back to London and stay out of our camp until you do.

73
00:11:53,238 --> 00:11:55,832
Did you have relations with an enlisted personnel...

74
00:11:55,907 --> 00:11:57,841
Captain Connor?

75
00:11:59,244 --> 00:12:01,178
I did, sir.

76
00:12:02,247 --> 00:12:04,511
She was willing.

77
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,642
Did you strike an officer of His Majesty's Navy?

78
00:12:07,719 --> 00:12:11,450
Not at all. I said something or other.

79
00:12:11,523 --> 00:12:15,619
He gave me a sort of push. It wasn't anything.

80
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:18,993
The police report called it "aggravated assault."

81
00:12:19,064 --> 00:12:20,031
Did it?

82
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:23,895
Your past record indicates that you were...

83
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:26,061
drunk with four enlisted men...

84
00:12:26,137 --> 00:12:30,039
and absent without leave...

85
00:12:30,108 --> 00:12:31,871
six times.

86
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:35,879
Even though you are currently awaiting orders for your next posting...

87
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:38,848
that is not a license to ignore military regulations...

88
00:12:38,917 --> 00:12:40,885
and bring disgrace to the uniform.

89
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,385
Yes, sir.

90
00:12:42,454 --> 00:12:46,083
It is within the authority of this review board...

91
00:12:46,157 --> 00:12:48,921
to reduce you in rank to the lowest commissioned rating.

92
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:54,488
However, we have been requested to hold our decision in abeyance...

93
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,500
by His Majesty's lntelligence.

94
00:12:56,568 --> 00:13:00,834
- General Kerr wishes to question you.   - Ben Kerr?

95
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,840
So it's a balls-up again, eh, Jack?

96
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,002
The army must be in a bad way for generals, makin' you one.

97
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,208
- You've got that bit right at least.   - What's an editor do in the army?

98
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:15,343
Write stories about Hitler's sex life and send 'em off to the newspapers?

99
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,618
We put corrupt and ill-assorted talents like yours to work winning the war.

100
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,158
I've requested your transfer to lntelligence.

101
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:26,163
Why in hell you want to do that?

102
00:13:26,231 --> 00:13:28,256
You're going to run a P.O.W. camp in Scotland.

103
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:31,131
God, Benny. I'm not a policeman.

104
00:13:31,202 --> 00:13:33,466
Damn good crime reporter, though.

105
00:13:33,538 --> 00:13:36,666
You've been a chaotic bastard for as long as I've known you.

106
00:13:36,741 --> 00:13:40,575
But you have a perverse sort of genius for setting things in order around you--

107
00:13:40,645 --> 00:13:43,409
when you've a mind to.

108
00:13:43,481 --> 00:13:46,075
I've a mind to go on a holiday at the moment.

109
00:13:46,151 --> 00:13:48,881
Well, that review board will see that you get it.

110
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:52,013
Jack, I'm saving your royal lrish ass for you...

111
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:56,493
and giving you the chance to do the sort of job you've always been keen on doing.

112
00:13:56,561 --> 00:13:59,496
Prisoners of war? I puke, sir.

113
00:13:59,564 --> 00:14:01,589
Now get stuffed, Jack.

114
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:04,635
I need you. I need your great nose to the ground.

115
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:08,599
The German prisoners, all top-line officers...

116
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:12,734
have been raising a peculiar sort of hell at McKenzie the past few months.

117
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,245
Other camps, relative quiet.

118
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,646
McKenzie, veritable state of siege.

119
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:24,084
Both War Office and lntelligence want to find out if there's any connection...

120
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:27,647
any link with the dear old Deutschland.

121
00:14:27,725 --> 00:14:29,158
You have full authorization...

122
00:14:29,227 --> 00:14:31,491
to do what you must to bring the camp around...

123
00:14:31,563 --> 00:14:33,827
and find out what we need to know.

124
00:14:33,898 --> 00:14:36,423
A Major Perry's in command there.

125
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,864
The captain tells the major how to run his camp?

126
00:14:41,473 --> 00:14:43,407
I thought that would amuse you.

127
00:14:43,475 --> 00:14:46,967
He'll be instructed to cooperate with Military lntelligence and so on.

128
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,138
What about that review board?

129
00:14:50,215 --> 00:14:53,412
Have you any ideas how to keep them off my back?

130
00:14:54,886 --> 00:14:58,617
I shall ponder the matter, old boy.

131
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,658
Can you give me something for diarrhea...

132
00:15:00,725 --> 00:15:02,659
headache or constipation?

133
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,252
Y es, here he comes-- Major Perry!

134
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:09,466
English. English.

135
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:14,567
Why are those boys fighting?

136
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,574
Why does that schoolmaster not stop them?

137
00:15:17,642 --> 00:15:20,304
Here he comes-- Major Perry!

138
00:15:36,427 --> 00:15:38,554
Quiet...quiet. There's more to come.

139
00:15:39,597 --> 00:15:43,363
The next one who whistles will be fined 10 marks.

140
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,907
All the English have fat asses

141
00:15:52,977 --> 00:15:56,606
Major Perry, Sergeant Cox

142
00:15:56,681 --> 00:16:00,481
We would like to give them handcuffs

143
00:16:00,552 --> 00:16:04,318
Put them in a six-feet box

144
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:08,086
When the war is gone and finished

145
00:16:08,159 --> 00:16:11,993
And we win the victory

146
00:16:12,063 --> 00:16:15,794
Deutschland then will be much bigger

147
00:16:15,867 --> 00:16:19,860
England then belongs to you and me

148
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:23,635
When the war is gone and finished

149
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:27,439
And we win the victory

150
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:31,414
Deutschland then will be much bigger

151
00:16:31,482 --> 00:16:35,316
England then belongs to you and me

152
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:39,288
We can stay in Camp McKenzie

153
00:16:39,357 --> 00:16:44,659
For England then belongs to you and me

154
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:55,768
Three cheers for Commandant Schluetter...

155
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,864
...hip hip, hooray.

156
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,166
It's a bloody English music hall.

157
00:17:24,636 --> 00:17:26,866
Is more fun in here without the English Tommies, eh?

158
00:17:32,410 --> 00:17:34,901
All of you   - thanks for this morning.

159
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,450
You make a lousy English lady, Schmidt.

160
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:47,218
She's too Jewish looking!

161
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:52,394
Neuchl, you should take the part.

162
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:54,397
You'd make a hell of an English lady.

163
00:17:59,404 --> 00:18:02,840
Why not bring your friend, Berger, up here to the stage...

164
00:18:02,907 --> 00:18:05,808
and do the sketch for us like two English ladies?

165
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:09,207
Won't you?

166
00:18:10,448 --> 00:18:13,781
Your position, Kapitan, is not so to give me such insult.

167
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,911
My position as your commanding officer is so...

168
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:19,616
to have you killed for being a coward, if I must.

169
00:18:19,691 --> 00:18:21,591
Are you not a coward?

170
00:18:21,659 --> 00:18:23,957
I obey the rules of a prisoner of war.

171
00:18:25,897 --> 00:18:28,991
As the German Camp Commandant...

172
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:34,164
...you know the Geneva Convention forbids you to incite a riot.

173
00:18:36,307 --> 00:18:38,241
You are a homosexual, are you not?

174
00:18:44,882 --> 00:18:47,817
Sorry. Your English is poor.

175
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,978
You're a queer aren't you?

176
00:18:52,156 --> 00:18:56,149
Why don't you ask Berger here to the stage?

177
00:18:56,227 --> 00:18:59,424
You can hug and kiss and have a lovely queer wedding.

178
00:19:17,081 --> 00:19:18,275
I'll see you later.

179
00:19:33,431 --> 00:19:37,424
To hell with orders, let's make a victory fire.

180
00:19:49,914 --> 00:19:52,348
Quite right, Mr. Cox. Fireworks night.

181
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:55,112
They're flaunting the blackout regulations, sir.

182
00:19:55,186 --> 00:19:57,780
Yes, celebrating my 48-hour punishment.

183
00:19:57,855 --> 00:20:01,154
- We'll see to that, sir.   - You'll see to what?

184
00:20:01,225 --> 00:20:05,025
You'll see to it that we're all made fools of once again.

185
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:08,122
Will you move men in there to enforce blackout regulations?

186
00:20:08,199 --> 00:20:12,568
Jerry will have disappeared by the time you get there, laughing at us.

187
00:20:12,637 --> 00:20:15,162
Your men will get a few more broken heads for their pains.

188
00:20:15,239 --> 00:20:18,572
The bleeding krauts are lightin' up the sky askin' for a raid, sir.

189
00:20:18,643 --> 00:20:23,012
There's never been a raid within 100 miles of this desolate chicken farm!

190
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,480
Only alerts. I mean, why bomb this?

191
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:30,749
This understaffed, ill-manned outpost of military mediocrities.

192
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:37,860
Thank you. That'll be all.

193
00:20:39,730 --> 00:20:43,427
Make transport arrangements for a Captain Connor coming up from London.

194
00:20:43,501 --> 00:20:46,436
- The details are in the orderly room.   - Yes, sir.

195
00:20:55,246 --> 00:20:58,147
Shall we finish the game, Mr. Hall?

196
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,150
As you like, sir.

197
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,481
Sorry.

198
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,150
I went a bit too far.

199
00:21:12,363 --> 00:21:15,662
I'm damned if I know what Whitehall expects.

200
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:20,761
"Don't move too aggressively. Thousands of our chaps in German prison camps."

201
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:22,567
And I quite agree.

202
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,803
"But can't you maintain order there, Major Perry?"

203
00:21:25,877 --> 00:21:29,870
And when I ask for troop reinforcements, they send me a single Captain Connor.

204
00:21:29,947 --> 00:21:33,781
"Let him have a look at the matter." I mean, oh, dear.

205
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,451
With those uniforms you look more British than the Guard.

206
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:46,125
No one will stop you once you are out of the gate.

207
00:22:02,647 --> 00:22:04,581
It's our Scottish contact.

208
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:07,777
He'll be waiting for Hochbauer and Schmidt on the Glenfoyle Road.

209
00:22:07,852 --> 00:22:09,285
Good.

210
00:22:17,929 --> 00:22:19,191
B is for Berlin and breakout.

211
00:22:19,397 --> 00:22:20,921
What did Berlin say?

212
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:23,966
English. It wasn't Berlin.

213
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:26,196
It was our friend here in Scotland...

214
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,261
and he agrees to an earlier meeting with you.

215
00:22:28,339 --> 00:22:31,604
Let's raise a little hell when Perry tries to put on the handcuffs...

216
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:34,702
and you can march straight off and join the British army.

217
00:22:38,616 --> 00:22:42,950
We used to have picnics here when I first came. It was grand.

218
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,389
They were so lonely, the German lads, and they were so nice.

219
00:22:48,459 --> 00:22:52,327
Then they made the rule, I guess. Closed the camp tight.

220
00:22:53,631 --> 00:22:55,565
When was that?

221
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:58,124
About a year ago, when the headmaster came.

222
00:22:58,202 --> 00:23:01,330
Uh, the Major. Major Perry, that is.

223
00:23:02,406 --> 00:23:05,569
When Major Perry came, sir.

224
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:26,391
You're a bunch of weaklings.

225
00:23:35,573 --> 00:23:38,337
Now it's the Lufwaffe's turn.

226
00:23:42,013 --> 00:23:44,243
Good morning, Captain Schleutter.

227
00:23:44,315 --> 00:23:46,408
Thank you for the list you sent me this morning.

228
00:23:46,484 --> 00:23:49,476
But there are others of us who speak excellent English.

229
00:23:49,754 --> 00:23:51,551
Your English is excellent, Kranz.

230
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:54,756
The tunnel was begun before you came here.

231
00:23:54,825 --> 00:23:58,090
Your list, the 28 men who are to escape, are all U-boat men.

232
00:23:58,162 --> 00:24:00,687
None of my men. None of Unger's engineers.

233
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:07,500
I took the tunnel over on orders from Hitler and Doenitz.

234
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:16,138
In order to get skilled U-boat men back into the war.

235
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:18,044
Germany must have them now.

236
00:24:18,282 --> 00:24:20,409
I understand, but my men want some explanation.

237
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:24,580
You're a Luftwaffe Commandant. Do you explain orders?

238
00:24:24,655 --> 00:24:28,682
I want some explanation about the way you treated Neuchl.

239
00:24:30,027 --> 00:24:35,124
That flying fairy, Hauptman, he's a bad German.

240
00:24:45,509 --> 00:24:49,605
Yes, I've spent a very decent holiday or two in lreland.

241
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,514
What made you decide to suspend the outside privileges for the Germans?

242
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:57,577
I felt that my predecessor had taken too many liberties with regulations.

243
00:24:58,522 --> 00:25:00,922
As a matter of fact, Von Westhofen agreed with me--

244
00:25:00,991 --> 00:25:05,052
the German senior officer in the camp until his death last April.

245
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:07,893
Nice old boy, General Von Westhofen.

246
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,762
A great feeling for books.

247
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,298
Complete opposite of the young devil now in command. You've heard of Schleutter?

248
00:25:15,372 --> 00:25:17,499
Yes. What did the nice old boy die of?

249
00:25:17,575 --> 00:25:19,543
- A natural death?   - Heart attack.

250
00:25:29,954 --> 00:25:31,478
Morning.

251
00:25:31,555 --> 00:25:35,047
Captain Connor's been sent up from London.

252
00:25:35,126 --> 00:25:38,789
He's to assist me in analyzing the problems here.

253
00:25:49,874 --> 00:25:52,968
When are you goin' to lift your 48-hour siege, sir?

254
00:25:53,043 --> 00:25:54,977
Tomorrow morning at reveille.

255
00:25:57,715 --> 00:26:01,116
- Let's have a look inside then.   - I think not, Captain.

256
00:26:01,185 --> 00:26:03,517
It would weaken the effect of the punishment.

257
00:26:03,587 --> 00:26:05,521
I should have a look around.

258
00:26:06,924 --> 00:26:10,155
Captain, 12 men were seriously injured in there yesterday.

259
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:12,559
If you go in, it's your responsibility.

260
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,154
Yes, sir.

261
00:26:15,466 --> 00:26:17,866
- Does that phone go to all the towers?   - Yes, sir.

262
00:26:17,935 --> 00:26:19,527
Excuse me.

263
00:26:26,744 --> 00:26:28,678
This is Captain Connor speaking.

264
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,607
I'm comin' inside now.

265
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:37,149
Will you come along, Mr. Cox?

266
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:48,693
Reinforcements   - one more man!

267
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,971
Looks like we have company.

268
00:27:45,522 --> 00:27:49,458
What do you suppose Von Westhofen died of, Mr. Cox?

269
00:27:49,526 --> 00:27:52,427
I expect it was as Major Perry said, sir.

270
00:27:52,496 --> 00:27:54,623
I'd like your opinion on that.

271
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:57,633
Well, he always seemed in the best of health to me, sir.

272
00:28:00,871 --> 00:28:03,237
You think Schleutter got rid of him?

273
00:28:03,307 --> 00:28:06,333
The bastard has control now. That's all I know.

274
00:28:11,348 --> 00:28:13,942
- Have you had any escapes?   - A few.

275
00:28:14,018 --> 00:28:17,181
Most of them get picked up in the local whorehouse.

276
00:28:18,188 --> 00:28:21,021
A couple did make it across to the lrish Free State.

277
00:28:21,091 --> 00:28:24,959
Hell, you say. Horrible place to wind up.

278
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:27,821
There's only one way to handle prisoners, sir.

279
00:28:28,699 --> 00:28:30,894
Lock 'em up someplace so tight...

280
00:28:30,968 --> 00:28:34,301
that all they can do is eat, sleep and shit.

281
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,840
But the Geneva Convention wouldn't abide it.

282
00:28:53,057 --> 00:28:54,991
Do they have any workshops?

283
00:28:55,059 --> 00:28:58,358
They can make almost anything you care to name.

284
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:01,796
Made uniforms as good as new for their top officers.

285
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:05,767
They've got the lot: tinkers, tailors.

286
00:29:05,836 --> 00:29:09,328
-Candlestick makers, I shouldn't wonder. -Did they make any guns yet?

287
00:29:09,406 --> 00:29:13,308
We search, we try to surprise them. We find nothing.

288
00:29:14,845 --> 00:29:17,575
It turns out we always get the surprises.

289
00:29:17,648 --> 00:29:20,048
- Is that Schleutter?   - Ay, number one barracks.

290
00:29:20,117 --> 00:29:22,449
To be sure.

291
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:31,484
"Quiet Willi."

292
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,725
His men aren't so quiet, though. He's seen to that.

293
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:38,461
He's got more authority here than he ever had on a U-boat.

294
00:29:38,535 --> 00:29:42,062
I heard about his playin' at war games yesterday.

295
00:29:42,139 --> 00:29:45,074
- Exciting, was it?   - You're dead right, sir.

296
00:29:45,142 --> 00:29:48,578
That's the mess hall up there. Around the corner is the cooler.

297
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:51,512
The Major hasn't made enough use of it yet, sir.

298
00:29:57,121 --> 00:29:59,055
Are you irritated by this lot?

299
00:29:59,123 --> 00:30:02,217
- I could do without them, sir.   - Quick march, then.

300
00:30:42,366 --> 00:30:44,596
That's lovely topsoil, Willi.

301
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:51,164
Were you satisfied with your turnip inspection, Captain?

302
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:53,209
Just grand.

303
00:30:53,277 --> 00:30:55,541
You're not puttin' the dirt from your tunnel there, are you?

304
00:30:56,613 --> 00:30:59,980
Tunnel? You're old-fashioned, Captain.

305
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,610
That's right.

306
00:31:02,686 --> 00:31:05,120
Yes, there must be a better way than that.

307
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:18,401
Attention, please.

308
00:31:18,469 --> 00:31:20,403
This is Major Perry.

309
00:31:21,238 --> 00:31:25,470
I am assigning Captain Connor officer in charge of roll call tomorrow morning.

310
00:31:26,543 --> 00:31:29,944
He will supervise the selection and handcuffing...

311
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:33,642
of 25 German officers immediately after roll call.

312
00:31:33,717 --> 00:31:35,480
Thank you.

313
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:48,691
There must be a better way.

314
00:31:58,642 --> 00:32:00,974
We keep this entrance from N.2. barracks clear...

315
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,705
...since it is the main escape hatch.

316
00:32:03,413 --> 00:32:05,438
If you will follow me to No.3.

317
00:32:05,649 --> 00:32:08,083
You can inspect the Attic there.

318
00:32:22,466 --> 00:32:24,161
Careful climbing through the latrine closet.

319
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,032
There is no light until the Attic.

320
00:32:41,318 --> 00:32:43,946
I have calculated the load on the ceiling.

321
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,053
We have 17,000 cubic centimeters of dirt.

322
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:51,186
I've installed cable supports...

323
00:32:51,261 --> 00:32:55,288
...crude but effective.

324
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:17,215
It's difficult with the advanced schedule.

325
00:33:17,588 --> 00:33:21,718
We don't have the incentive of being among those to escape.

326
00:33:28,298 --> 00:33:30,926
Of course solving the problem is incentive enough for me.

327
00:33:32,035 --> 00:33:33,730
I am an engineer.

328
00:33:34,938 --> 00:33:36,530
Be a fast engineer, Unger.

329
00:33:59,696 --> 00:34:01,960
We are five meters from the fence...

330
00:34:02,899 --> 00:34:05,459
...and 26 meters from the stream.

331
00:34:08,438 --> 00:34:13,137
We will have to use the roof space in Barracks 2.

332
00:34:13,977 --> 00:34:16,946
Barracks 3 will soon be filled.

333
00:34:19,883 --> 00:34:22,113
- Good evening, Mr. Cox.   - Good evening, sir.

334
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,643
- You ordered reveille at 0600 hours.   - That's right.

335
00:34:25,722 --> 00:34:28,418
And C Company to fall out with 25 handcuffs.

336
00:34:28,492 --> 00:34:30,483
Right.

337
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,222
And call the fire brigade, will you?

338
00:34:33,296 --> 00:34:35,230
- Fire brigade.   - Sir.

339
00:34:54,418 --> 00:34:56,818
Divide them between the front two ranks.

340
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,821
Two to each rank.

341
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,234
Half left, wheel.

342
00:35:53,477 --> 00:35:55,411
Right wheel!

343
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:02,881
This is Captain Connor speaking.

344
00:36:02,953 --> 00:36:05,615
To all prisoners: There'll be immediate roll call.

345
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:11,621
I repeat: There'll be an immediate roll call and 25 men will be handcuffed.

346
00:36:15,365 --> 00:36:17,731
Enter the barracks as previously instructed.

347
00:36:17,768 --> 00:36:19,360
Move!

348
00:36:41,024 --> 00:36:44,551
Nobody here, sir. Dead empty. Mother Hubbard.

349
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:46,095
Same here, sir.

350
00:36:48,465 --> 00:36:50,057
Proceed with caution.

351
00:36:52,035 --> 00:36:55,402
Six men to hut two. On the double!

352
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:13,020
Move in quickly.

353
00:37:29,105 --> 00:37:30,037
Get back!

354
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,736
You don't have to make it look this realistic.

355
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:44,114
Take it easy, you don't have to kill me.

356
00:37:44,187 --> 00:37:45,916
Hey, you two men!

357
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,047
Get back!

358
00:37:48,191 --> 00:37:50,659
Good, now get in there and mix with the British.

359
00:37:53,663 --> 00:37:55,927
Jerry's taking the bait.

360
00:38:08,278 --> 00:38:11,406
Watch out, the swines have called the Fire Brigade.

361
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:12,941
Hurry.

362
00:38:29,132 --> 00:38:31,623
Mr. Cox, turn it on!

363
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,008
It's time for the Luftwaffe. Get Neuchl.

364
00:38:49,653 --> 00:38:50,677
Four men with me.

365
00:41:48,798 --> 00:41:50,129
Get that man!

366
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:15,648
Handcuff the bastards.

367
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:34,432
Mr. Cox, that'll do.

368
00:42:35,745 --> 00:42:37,007
Off!

369
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:46,411
You seem to have won an argument over handcuffs, Captain.

370
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:50,420
And you got all wet, Willi.

371
00:42:50,493 --> 00:42:53,189
Have your men out in one hour for roll call.

372
00:42:54,464 --> 00:42:58,025
I insist on visiting your infirmary immediately...

373
00:42:58,101 --> 00:43:00,069
to see to the condition of my men.

374
00:43:01,037 --> 00:43:03,403
Right after the roll call, Willi.

375
00:43:29,766 --> 00:43:32,530
- And speak English.   - Okay.

376
00:43:32,602 --> 00:43:36,231
I'm glad to be out too. But we have to find our chum in Cathness.

377
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:43,274
What the hell is he sayin'?

378
00:43:44,881 --> 00:43:47,315
I think he's unconscious, sir.

379
00:43:51,187 --> 00:43:53,178
When he comes around I want to talk to him.

380
00:43:53,256 --> 00:43:55,315
- Do whatever you have to.   - Do my best.

381
00:43:59,662 --> 00:44:03,098
That man's in a very bad way. Our chaps didn't have to go that far.

382
00:44:03,166 --> 00:44:05,259
It wasn't them that did it to him.

383
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:08,133
It was his own lot. Damn near killed him.

384
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:12,073
Working off some private grudge, perhaps.

385
00:44:12,141 --> 00:44:13,870
Sir, this just came.

386
00:44:13,943 --> 00:44:18,437
Keep a close guard on him, Sergeant. I don't want anyone near him.

387
00:44:18,514 --> 00:44:20,004
- Captain Connor.   - Sir.

388
00:44:23,686 --> 00:44:25,620
The Germans have taken the handcuffs off our men.

389
00:44:25,688 --> 00:44:29,089
- Yes, I knew about that.   - You knew?

390
00:44:29,158 --> 00:44:31,922
I knew before I left London.

391
00:44:31,995 --> 00:44:33,929
Then those men must be unshackled at once.

392
00:44:33,997 --> 00:44:35,988
Not just yet, sir.

393
00:44:37,133 --> 00:44:40,796
Captain, I'm instructed to cooperate with you, not relinquish my command.

394
00:44:40,870 --> 00:44:42,804
Not at all, sir.

395
00:44:42,872 --> 00:44:46,774
But you see, you must comply with what the lntelligence mission requires.

396
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:50,711
And I didn't come here just to put down a riot.

397
00:44:52,282 --> 00:44:55,183
Are you formally requesting me to contravene the Geneva Convention?

398
00:44:56,386 --> 00:44:58,445
For a few hours is all.

399
00:44:58,521 --> 00:45:00,614
Very well, Captain Connor.

400
00:45:01,691 --> 00:45:04,353
I'm sure today's episode can only redound to your credit.

401
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:06,651
Sir.

402
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:14,536
I want a complete list of the numbers and injuries to our men.

403
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,649
Eighty present and correct, sir.

404
00:45:34,724 --> 00:45:36,885
Carry on, Sergeant.

405
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:07,880
Sir, checked parade four. All present and accounted for.

406
00:46:07,957 --> 00:46:10,255
Parade, dismiss!

407
00:46:25,875 --> 00:46:28,275
I have permission to check on the condition of my men.

408
00:46:28,344 --> 00:46:30,608
Yes, sir. Go inside, please.

409
00:46:32,048 --> 00:46:34,278
These look like knife cuts.

410
00:46:34,350 --> 00:46:36,784
He lost a lot of blood. Put him to bed.

411
00:46:51,334 --> 00:46:52,266
Where's Neuchl?

412
00:46:52,802 --> 00:46:54,030
In that little room.

413
00:46:56,839 --> 00:47:00,434
- Does the music bother you, sir?   - Not at all.

414
00:47:00,510 --> 00:47:05,004
It's a therapy, of course, sir. Germans are fond of this kind of thing.

415
00:47:05,081 --> 00:47:07,515
I've always collected classical music because--

416
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:15,748
Have you any of that medical brandy?

417
00:47:15,825 --> 00:47:17,417
Y es, sir.

418
00:47:19,762 --> 00:47:21,889
Will you have a drink, Captain?

419
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,024
Do I understand you refuse me the right to see one of my men?

420
00:47:26,836 --> 00:47:29,930
- Just the one brandy, Corporal, please.   - Y es, sir.

421
00:47:30,006 --> 00:47:33,271
Well, he doesn't seem to be too anxious to see you.

422
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:38,371
He got away from those brutes of yours, didn't he?

423
00:47:39,715 --> 00:47:41,307
They nearly killed him.

424
00:47:41,384 --> 00:47:43,682
He's under the care of the chief surgeon.

425
00:47:46,722 --> 00:47:49,282
You lrish are just fabulous, Captain.

426
00:47:49,358 --> 00:47:53,954
You really have got that famous lrish imagination.

427
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:57,989
But your water sports this morning made such a confusion.

428
00:47:58,067 --> 00:48:00,001
Who knows what you saw?

429
00:48:01,103 --> 00:48:04,368
I know what I saw. I saw a man tryin' to escape.

430
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,665
I'm not contradicting you really, Captain.

431
00:48:07,743 --> 00:48:11,110
You may have seen an attempted escape.

432
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:13,341
Is it not the duty of all prisoners to try?

433
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,815
- Sir.   - Thank you, Corporal.

434
00:48:23,459 --> 00:48:24,892
Toscanini?

435
00:48:26,963 --> 00:48:29,329
Furtwangler does it better.

436
00:48:39,442 --> 00:48:44,175
By the way, the German camps have taken the shackles off the British prisoners.

437
00:48:44,247 --> 00:48:46,841
And we shall reciprocate very soon.

438
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,784
Of course, your lads did quite a bit of damage.

439
00:48:56,859 --> 00:48:59,555
We'll have to deduct that from their pay.

440
00:48:59,695 --> 00:49:02,357
And that will be all for now, Captain.

441
00:49:02,431 --> 00:49:05,195
You'll want to see your men.

442
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:09,568
And Captain, deduct the damages from my pay.

443
00:49:09,639 --> 00:49:12,631
- Thank you.   - You've done too much as it is.

444
00:49:25,721 --> 00:49:28,315
Keep your eye on that one. See that he leaves soon.

445
00:49:28,391 --> 00:49:31,792
And don't let anyone else in without my authorization.

446
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:41,670
There they are.

447
00:49:41,737 --> 00:49:45,332
Take these books to the prisoners. I've inspected them.

448
00:49:49,645 --> 00:49:51,579
This is all the Kriegsmariners?

449
00:49:51,647 --> 00:49:54,047
Y es. I separated them.

450
00:49:54,116 --> 00:49:57,051
I don't read German all that well.

451
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,110
I don't even know what the hell I'm lookin' for.

452
00:49:59,188 --> 00:50:02,123
- What's that?   - Ewigkeit.

453
00:50:04,827 --> 00:50:07,728
"My dear wife, it has seemed like an eternity...

454
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:10,766
since last I kissed your bosom...

455
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:13,267
and slept with my arms entwined...

456
00:50:13,336 --> 00:50:15,930
around your body."

457
00:50:16,005 --> 00:50:18,439
You read these horny letters all day?

458
00:50:18,507 --> 00:50:21,101
-That's the function of the post office. -lt is?

459
00:50:23,212 --> 00:50:25,703
"The turnip fields are growing, dear...

460
00:50:25,781 --> 00:50:30,275
and we are going to do several plays by Shakespeare.

461
00:50:30,353 --> 00:50:35,256
I wish I had you with me now to put my arms around and feel your bosom."

462
00:50:35,324 --> 00:50:37,622
Bosom, bosom, bosom.

463
00:50:37,693 --> 00:50:40,662
Why do they put that Roman numeral in the date?

464
00:50:40,730 --> 00:50:44,029
- What date?   - The date has a Roman numeral in it.

465
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,001
- You ever notice that?   - I never noticed that before.

466
00:50:48,137 --> 00:50:51,334
He's got that queer little German seven...

467
00:50:51,407 --> 00:50:55,844
and the one and the two, but it starts off with a Roman numeral.

468
00:50:56,946 --> 00:51:00,814
We're gonna get us a code man down here from London...

469
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:03,477
and have him take a look at these horny letters.

470
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:20,600
Get back to bed! Do you hear me?

471
00:51:50,166 --> 00:51:53,192
Look out! They've got a hostage! Get back to your beds immediately!

472
00:52:20,596 --> 00:52:23,292
Have I kept you waitin', Willi?

473
00:52:23,365 --> 00:52:26,892
It's your prison, Captain. We follow your orders.

474
00:52:26,969 --> 00:52:30,769
You have imposed your kind of order, haven't you?

475
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:33,308
- Did you know him well?   - No.

476
00:52:33,375 --> 00:52:35,434
What's his name? You know that.

477
00:52:35,511 --> 00:52:37,536
Rupert Neuchl.

478
00:52:37,613 --> 00:52:40,138
You have it on your hospital report.

479
00:52:40,216 --> 00:52:43,481
I mean, he must have regained consciousness during the day.

480
00:52:43,552 --> 00:52:45,884
He hanged himself.

481
00:52:45,955 --> 00:52:48,890
Do you want to write that to his family, or should I do it?

482
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:51,688
It won't be necessary.

483
00:52:51,761 --> 00:52:54,525
- Why'd he hang himself?   - He was weak.

484
00:52:54,597 --> 00:52:57,259
He was a homosexual. Why do you ask me?

485
00:52:57,333 --> 00:53:01,292
We asked everyone else in the ward. They didn't see anything, of course.

486
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:04,362
You're the commanding officer. Why'd he die?

487
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,374
Captain, he died under your custody.

488
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:13,111
I smell cognac, I think.

489
00:53:13,916 --> 00:53:16,282
You smell lrish whiskey, I think.

490
00:53:16,352 --> 00:53:18,786
- There you are.   - Thank you.

491
00:53:31,767 --> 00:53:34,531
It's a pity the corpse never enjoys the wake.

492
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:38,667
A hell of a nice fellow to talk to, though.

493
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:40,208
Here's to you, Rupert.

494
00:53:43,412 --> 00:53:47,143
Your German-- you're pronouncing it very good today.

495
00:53:47,216 --> 00:53:50,811
You're pronouncin' your English very good too.

496
00:53:50,886 --> 00:53:52,979
Where'd you learn English, Willi?

497
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:55,683
Bremen UnterZeeboot Academie, ten years ago.

498
00:53:56,759 --> 00:53:59,057
- How old are you?   - Twenty-seven.

499
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:05,492
You must've had a couple of years in the Hitler Youth Camp then, with some luck.

500
00:54:06,602 --> 00:54:08,627
A lot of luck.

501
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,638
Two years.

502
00:54:12,341 --> 00:54:14,275
And you?

503
00:54:14,343 --> 00:54:15,901
Me what?

504
00:54:15,978 --> 00:54:20,074
- I mean, how old?   - I'm 44.

505
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,682
- Still very much alive.   - I'm quite well, thanks.

506
00:54:24,753 --> 00:54:26,948
I mean, your new command is very much impressed.

507
00:54:27,022 --> 00:54:29,957
One of those nice elderly British guards told me today...

508
00:54:30,025 --> 00:54:31,959
you were a hell of a journalist.

509
00:54:32,027 --> 00:54:36,157
That's true. I'm a hell of a journalist. I could make you famous, Willi.

510
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:39,258
Now why don't you tell the lively old crime reporter why the man's dead?

511
00:54:42,037 --> 00:54:45,063
You expect me to tell you that I killed him, and why?

512
00:54:46,609 --> 00:54:49,043
No, you don't have to.

513
00:54:49,111 --> 00:54:51,102
I can see your pleasure in the kill.

514
00:54:53,549 --> 00:54:55,483
Can you?

515
00:54:58,721 --> 00:55:02,589
Perhaps you can see somebody who believes in the war...

516
00:55:02,658 --> 00:55:06,094
who believes in his people, his leaders.

517
00:55:06,161 --> 00:55:08,789
We kill in a war for those things, huh?

518
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,957
But maybe you don't.

519
00:55:12,034 --> 00:55:16,835
I mean, you're lrish and you're a captain in the British army.

520
00:55:16,906 --> 00:55:21,570
That same British army that has killed your own lrish people for centuries.

521
00:55:21,644 --> 00:55:24,078
What do you really believe in? What kind of order?

522
00:55:24,146 --> 00:55:26,080
What laws do you obey?

523
00:55:28,884 --> 00:55:32,786
Well, I obey as few laws as I have to.

524
00:55:32,855 --> 00:55:36,291
And I'm not much of a one for order.

525
00:55:37,593 --> 00:55:40,824
It has to be, I suppose...

526
00:55:40,896 --> 00:55:44,332
but there's order and then there's order, isn't there?

527
00:55:46,068 --> 00:55:49,504
Death is a kind of order, isn't it?

528
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:54,075
I mean, Neuchl there, he's all in order now.

529
00:55:55,744 --> 00:55:59,271
But, Willi, that's an awful lot of shit about your people.

530
00:55:59,348 --> 00:56:02,112
You've killed two of them that I know of.

531
00:56:03,252 --> 00:56:04,685
That's not true.

532
00:56:04,753 --> 00:56:07,813
You killed him and you probably killed your commanding officer as well.

533
00:56:07,890 --> 00:56:10,723
And for that I'm goin' to see you hang.

534
00:56:15,397 --> 00:56:17,331
You enjoy killing too, huh?

535
00:56:21,937 --> 00:56:25,464
- Mr. Cox.   - Do you not, Captain Connor?

536
00:56:27,242 --> 00:56:30,973
See that the Captain's escorted back to his quarters, if you please.

537
00:56:56,505 --> 00:56:58,439
Gate, gentlemen!

538
00:57:16,892 --> 00:57:19,793
Connor wants me to think that Neuchl told him something.

539
00:57:20,062 --> 00:57:22,030
I don't think it was much. I'm not sure.

540
00:57:22,664 --> 00:57:25,428
'28 Submariners' Connor said to me in German.

541
00:57:25,501 --> 00:57:26,331
My God!

542
00:57:28,804 --> 00:57:31,398
He will do nothing for the moment.

543
00:57:32,408 --> 00:57:34,137
But he'll try to prove I killed Neuchl.

544
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:37,574
Meanwhile we go ahead of schedule.

545
00:57:38,947 --> 00:57:40,938
Hochbauer and Schmidt won't be back until Friday.

546
00:57:41,016 --> 00:57:44,247
The tunnel won't reach the stream for five days.

547
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:50,315
Tell Unger not to go to the stream.

548
00:57:50,759 --> 00:57:54,024
Divert and go under the Guard house.

549
00:57:56,999 --> 00:57:59,365
It's much shorter.

550
00:57:59,435 --> 00:58:02,700
Don't let the men know it.

551
00:58:03,806 --> 00:58:05,103
Go ahead of schedule.

552
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:31,365
That's our contact.

553
00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:35,503
Can I give you boys a lift?

554
00:58:35,571 --> 00:58:38,199
What are they writing home about, Lieutenant?

555
00:58:38,273 --> 00:58:39,706
I can't really tell yet.

556
00:58:39,775 --> 00:58:43,438
It's a question of assembling the basic code pattern. As you see--

557
00:58:43,512 --> 00:58:46,276
- When will you know anything?   - Hard to say.

558
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:48,782
Could be a day, could be a week if there are variations.

559
00:58:48,851 --> 00:58:52,947
But we don't have to wait for a decoded message to know that we have trouble.

560
00:58:53,021 --> 00:58:55,751
Obviously Schleutter's at the center of it.

561
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,758
We must transfer him to Blackpool.

562
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:01,455
- I need him here a bit longer.   - You need him?

563
00:59:01,530 --> 00:59:06,126
He's at the center, but of what? I can't find out if he's in Blackpool.

564
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:21,554
You must block the old tunnel and be as quick as you can with this one.

565
00:59:26,364 --> 00:59:28,764
Lousy work but necessary.

566
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:52,741
Have you met any resistance in the barracks, Mr. Cox?

567
01:01:54,045 --> 01:01:55,376
Nothing? Good.

568
01:01:55,447 --> 01:01:58,610
Well, inform me directly if anything at all happens.

569
01:01:58,683 --> 01:02:00,514
Y es. Thank you, Sergeant Major.

570
01:02:00,585 --> 01:02:04,783
Come in, Captain Connor. I think you ought to know we're onto something.

571
01:02:04,856 --> 01:02:06,790
Thank you.

572
01:02:06,858 --> 01:02:10,851
It appears that 28 submariners are due to escape.

573
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:12,829
There's a U-boat coming to pick them up.

574
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:16,333
"U-841 available. Assign 28 men. Location, date agreeable."

575
01:02:16,401 --> 01:02:19,598
- What's the location and date?   - We checked all the letters.

576
01:02:19,671 --> 01:02:23,334
Specific time must've been set before in something they received earlier.

577
01:02:23,408 --> 01:02:26,343
It doesn't matter. We'll move in now and break it up.

578
01:02:26,411 --> 01:02:30,404
There's got to be a tunnel. We'll pull every barracks apart until we find it.

579
01:02:31,950 --> 01:02:35,408
Lieutenant, could you excuse us a minute, please?

580
01:02:35,487 --> 01:02:38,945
Go and have a cup of coffee or something.

581
01:02:51,736 --> 01:02:54,102
What if we were to let 'em go?

582
01:02:54,172 --> 01:02:58,666
Then we could follow and find out where the rendezvous is and land the sub.

583
01:02:58,743 --> 01:03:01,303
How'd Willi like that?

584
01:03:01,379 --> 01:03:02,744
Permit the escape?

585
01:03:03,481 --> 01:03:06,814
The tunnel's got to come up within 50 yards of that fence.

586
01:03:06,885 --> 01:03:10,912
All we have to do is put patrols out there, see where they come through.

587
01:03:11,923 --> 01:03:13,857
We keep radio contact.

588
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,428
Then we inform the military and civilian police all the way out to the coast.

589
01:03:20,698 --> 01:03:23,929
Then we nab the sub and the whole lot.

590
01:03:24,002 --> 01:03:27,597
My job is to run this camp and account for the prisoners in it.

591
01:03:27,672 --> 01:03:30,971
And curiously enough that doesn't include letting 28 of them escape...

592
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:33,772
to further your military career, Captain.

593
01:03:36,247 --> 01:03:39,444
Under my instructions at this moment, our men are searching German barracks.

594
01:03:40,952 --> 01:03:43,944
- Perry.   - It's Major Perry, Captain!

595
01:03:44,022 --> 01:03:46,490
I'm your superior officer and you will respect the rank.

596
01:03:46,558 --> 01:03:49,891
I don't give a damn about your bloody rank, or anyone else's.

597
01:03:49,961 --> 01:03:52,486
I got sent up here to do a job.

598
01:03:52,564 --> 01:03:55,499
I'm supposed to find out what's behind that break.

599
01:03:55,567 --> 01:03:59,298
If you don't like what I'm doing, call General Kerr and have him relieve me.

600
01:04:02,373 --> 01:04:04,807
Now bring the men back and stop that search.

601
01:04:06,978 --> 01:04:10,243
The War Office has given you a unique authority here.

602
01:04:11,382 --> 01:04:13,976
I suppose I must yield to it.

603
01:04:14,052 --> 01:04:16,987
Even though I believe you to be mistaken and an arrogant fool.

604
01:04:19,924 --> 01:04:22,484
I'll give the order, Captain.

605
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,154
Then I'll phone London and have them remove one of us...

606
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:27,289
from this intolerable situation.

607
01:04:44,616 --> 01:04:47,551
Search has been called off. Everything back.

608
01:04:49,287 --> 01:04:51,619
Why give up the search, Captain?

609
01:04:51,689 --> 01:04:55,887
Sir! There's something in here you ought to see, sir.

610
01:05:05,770 --> 01:05:08,034
And this one's just been sick, sir.

611
01:05:11,609 --> 01:05:14,169
Mr. Cashman, we'll have a roll call.

612
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:16,509
Yes, sir. Carry on, Sergeant.

613
01:05:19,217 --> 01:05:21,947
- How long have they been away with--   - Who?

614
01:05:23,755 --> 01:05:25,814
I want the names of these two that escaped.

615
01:05:25,890 --> 01:05:27,949
Sorry. I didn't know them personally.

616
01:05:32,330 --> 01:05:34,594
Seal off the barracks until further orders.

617
01:05:39,571 --> 01:05:42,062
It's very likely to be a long roll call, Willi.

618
01:06:55,580 --> 01:06:59,380
Submarines do well in water, not the Luftwaffe.

619
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:03,783
Give it up, Schluetter.

620
01:07:23,508 --> 01:07:25,169
17 hours.

621
01:07:25,243 --> 01:07:29,009
The truck will be close enough to signal.

622
01:07:29,547 --> 01:07:31,071
You mean to go tonight?

623
01:07:50,668 --> 01:07:52,363
Soldier!

624
01:07:52,437 --> 01:07:55,429
I want to speak to Sergeant Major Cox.

625
01:08:01,345 --> 01:08:03,870
Captain Schleutter gave us the names of the two men who escaped.

626
01:08:03,948 --> 01:08:07,475
He's instructed his men to stand by for roll call.

627
01:08:10,755 --> 01:08:13,952
Why the hell does he bother to knuckle under now?

628
01:08:14,025 --> 01:08:16,516
I'll get identifications on the wire, sir.

629
01:08:16,594 --> 01:08:20,086
Guards. Open the barracks and let the bastards in out of the rain.

630
01:08:26,070 --> 01:08:28,402
It's been an uncomfortable day gentlemen.

631
01:08:29,474 --> 01:08:30,873
Dry off.

632
01:08:30,942 --> 01:08:36,972
You never stop, eh Captain?

633
01:08:37,682 --> 01:08:40,617
What are your plans for tomorrow?

634
01:08:40,685 --> 01:08:45,679
First a meal and dreams of warm women.

635
01:08:48,526 --> 01:08:52,394
The damn fool doesn't care if we all get pneumonia.

636
01:08:52,463 --> 01:08:53,896
Shut up!

637
01:08:54,065 --> 01:08:56,625
Don't hang yourself like Neuchl.

638
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,545
Tell the men that we go right after lights out.

639
01:09:12,116 --> 01:09:14,346
We should wait until Connor is less alert.

640
01:09:14,619 --> 01:09:15,916
We don't have to go tonight.

641
01:09:16,254 --> 01:09:18,119
Connor will have this hands full in this barracks tonight.

642
01:09:19,390 --> 01:09:22,518
We meet in No. 2 barracks an hour after lights out.

643
01:09:46,450 --> 01:09:47,474
Are we going to make it?

644
01:09:48,019 --> 01:09:50,920
We've almost finished.

645
01:09:51,689 --> 01:09:54,556
The rain has put a bad strain on the support.

646
01:09:56,194 --> 01:09:58,219
We'll be alright, I'm sure.

647
01:11:14,171 --> 01:11:16,435
Pour us a drink, Mr. Cox.

648
01:11:20,778 --> 01:11:23,338
Take some of that from the stores and give it to the lads outside.

649
01:11:23,414 --> 01:11:26,679
Thank you, sir. The old sweats'll appreciate that.

650
01:11:31,022 --> 01:11:33,820
In the morning get me that friend of Neuchl's-- what's his name--

651
01:11:33,891 --> 01:11:35,620
Lieutenant Berger.

652
01:12:48,432 --> 01:12:49,626
Help!

653
01:13:19,163 --> 01:13:24,066
Guards! Come on out of there! Come on. Move, move!

654
01:13:24,135 --> 01:13:28,401
Let's have you! Go look on the other side!

655
01:13:28,472 --> 01:13:30,064
Come on!

656
01:13:34,912 --> 01:13:37,608
- Which one?   - I don't know.

657
01:13:39,216 --> 01:13:41,377
Hello, towers. Which one?

658
01:13:41,519 --> 01:13:44,977
Barracks three. Looks like the whole damned thing caved in.

659
01:13:45,056 --> 01:13:46,717
Thanks.

660
01:14:01,539 --> 01:14:03,131
Bloody hell!

661
01:14:06,677 --> 01:14:10,579
Come on. Out of the bloody way! Move! Out! Out!

662
01:14:12,216 --> 01:14:14,810
Right. Let's get through this rubbish.

663
01:14:20,057 --> 01:14:21,820
What are you looking at? Get moving.

664
01:14:34,772 --> 01:14:36,569
Go   - quietly   - Go!

665
01:15:02,900 --> 01:15:07,530
Patrols Able, Baker, Charlie, keep in radio contact with me and the main gate.

666
01:15:12,643 --> 01:15:14,577
Give us an axe.

667
01:15:15,713 --> 01:15:18,648
Get an axe and smash the other door down.

668
01:15:21,418 --> 01:15:23,978
Get this lot back in their beds and count 'em.

669
01:15:24,054 --> 01:15:26,750
Get the men back to their beds for a check.

670
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,162
Now Holtz   - collapse it!

671
01:16:12,236 --> 01:16:14,727
Clumsy idiot, you could have killed us all.

672
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:30,583
Six dead so far, sir.

673
01:16:32,089 --> 01:16:34,148
Find the damned tunnel.

674
01:17:42,493 --> 01:17:45,519
- What the hell's going on now?   - I don't exactly know, sir.

675
01:17:45,596 --> 01:17:48,929
- Number three's roof's collapsed.   - The roof's collapsed?

676
01:17:48,999 --> 01:17:50,364
Y es, sir.

677
01:17:50,434 --> 01:17:52,493
Captain Connor's up there now, sir.

678
01:17:52,569 --> 01:17:56,528
Is he? Has he checked round his exterior patrols?

679
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,599
- Not as far as I know, sir.   - Do that now.

680
01:17:59,677 --> 01:18:01,406
Drive on.

681
01:18:20,097 --> 01:18:21,758
You men get the stretcher.

682
01:20:23,220 --> 01:20:25,620
I'll see if they've got the count, sir.

683
01:20:31,428 --> 01:20:35,364
Sergeant, get back down to the main gate and get a three-tonner here for wounded.

684
01:20:35,432 --> 01:20:38,367
- Have you got the count yet?   - Not yet, Major.

685
01:20:57,721 --> 01:20:59,655
Only ten dead, Connor.

686
01:21:04,194 --> 01:21:06,890
Thirty-seven not accounted for.

687
01:21:08,298 --> 01:21:10,926
I think we've located the tunnel, sir.

688
01:21:19,176 --> 01:21:21,144
Hold it. It's collapsed.

689
01:21:30,587 --> 01:21:32,248
Yes, sir. Ten dead.

690
01:21:32,322 --> 01:21:35,291
Another 27 trapped when the tunnel collapsed.

691
01:21:35,359 --> 01:21:37,759
Presumably Captain Schleutter was with them.

692
01:21:38,962 --> 01:21:41,988
No, sir. It'll take several hours of digging.

693
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:46,331
It needn't have happened. I'm sending you a complete report in a few hours.

694
01:21:48,305 --> 01:21:51,069
No, sir. He hasn't accomplished a thing.

695
01:21:51,141 --> 01:21:54,076
You may inform General Kerr that Captain Connor's mission here...

696
01:21:54,144 --> 01:21:56,669
has been a fatal mistake.

697
01:21:58,515 --> 01:21:59,880
Good night, sir.

698
01:22:34,151 --> 01:22:37,609
Nothing, sir. Not a bloody one of them!

699
01:22:44,227 --> 01:22:46,491
Base Station Five. This is Connor.

700
01:22:48,065 --> 01:22:50,499
Give us a police frequency.

701
01:22:56,840 --> 01:23:00,241
Roadblock in position on A85.

702
01:23:02,179 --> 01:23:06,047
Police report no suspicious traffic on the B828...

703
01:23:06,116 --> 01:23:08,346
and continue mobile patrols north.

704
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:11,413
All units.

705
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:15,288
Per the McKenzie break, escaped prisoners should be considered armed.

706
01:23:18,629 --> 01:23:21,063
All units station traffic, please copy.

707
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:25,630
Northeast of Perth and Aberfeldy...

708
01:23:25,702 --> 01:23:27,226
east to Dunfermline...

709
01:23:27,304 --> 01:23:29,135
south to Falkirk...

710
01:23:29,206 --> 01:23:32,698
southwest to Glasgow, west to lnverary.

711
01:23:32,776 --> 01:23:36,542
The following roadblocks will go into effect in the immediate area--

712
01:23:36,613 --> 01:23:40,447
Number 33 between McKenzie and Stirling.

713
01:23:55,932 --> 01:23:59,493
This is Glengarry police.

714
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:03,665
We require extra mobiles to maintain watch on coast road.

715
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,332
Glengarry police, over.

716
01:24:08,278 --> 01:24:10,212
North Shore coast guards.

717
01:24:10,280 --> 01:24:12,805
Coastal Command.

718
01:24:12,883 --> 01:24:15,545
We have no response from northern moorland's road net.

719
01:24:15,619 --> 01:24:18,486
Presumably still in effect from the Southern Lochs...

720
01:24:18,555 --> 01:24:20,819
as far north as Loch Glenny.

721
01:24:23,860 --> 01:24:27,660
Case section at Clough here. All units please reply.

722
01:24:27,731 --> 01:24:29,665
Please, repeat, all units.

723
01:24:29,733 --> 01:24:32,668
- Sir! General Kerr's arrived.   - Oh, God.

724
01:24:38,475 --> 01:24:41,376
- What happened?   - Balls-up, sir. Simple as that.

725
01:24:41,445 --> 01:24:43,208
Nothing simple about it.

726
01:24:43,280 --> 01:24:45,805
Worse than what happened at Bowmanville Camp in Canada last year...

727
01:24:45,882 --> 01:24:48,908
and Whitehall thought that was a disaster.

728
01:24:48,985 --> 01:24:51,351
Perry's made a full report to top staff.

729
01:24:51,421 --> 01:24:53,753
I don't blame him. I could have prevented it.

730
01:24:53,824 --> 01:24:58,022
That's dead right. Now, let's get back, shall we, old chap?

731
01:25:08,238 --> 01:25:10,433
I don't care what the priority classification is.

732
01:25:10,507 --> 01:25:12,737
I want three more aircraft.

733
01:25:12,809 --> 01:25:14,743
You're damned right I do.

734
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:18,980
Coastal Command say there are several thousand miles...

735
01:25:19,049 --> 01:25:21,643
of naturally camouflaged coastline around Scotland...

736
01:25:21,718 --> 01:25:23,652
and how in the hell can they cover it all.

737
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:26,621
Northern moorlands road net-- nothing.

738
01:25:26,690 --> 01:25:29,557
There's another call for you, sir.

739
01:25:33,630 --> 01:25:37,225
I'm afraid it's essential to use civilian police, sir.

740
01:26:02,325 --> 01:26:04,623
- lmportant?   - Aye.

741
01:26:04,694 --> 01:26:06,958
Go ahead.

742
01:26:24,915 --> 01:26:26,906
There's a truck on the A828.

743
01:26:26,983 --> 01:26:29,918
Explosives with a police motorcycle escorting it.

744
01:26:37,027 --> 01:26:40,485
No, sir. Explosives are under the ministry of Fuel and Power.

745
01:26:40,564 --> 01:26:43,658
The escort duty our men are assigned to is never for...

746
01:26:43,733 --> 01:26:47,100
industrial or mining purposes during wartime.

747
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:50,799
- We never assign men for--   - Thanks very much.

748
01:27:07,624 --> 01:27:12,584
Base Section, this is Zero 468.

749
01:27:12,662 --> 01:27:15,961
I'm over Ballachulish. All clear, turning south.

750
01:28:21,865 --> 01:28:24,766
There's an explosives truck with a motorcycle escort...

751
01:28:24,834 --> 01:28:28,201
heading north on Highway B828.

752
01:28:28,271 --> 01:28:30,364
Stay up there. Don't move in close.

753
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:32,670
Roger.

754
01:28:39,015 --> 01:28:41,347
Let's lose him   - turn right in here.

755
01:29:17,654 --> 01:29:21,647
They're either goin' for the Firth of Lorne or else Loch Linnhe.

756
01:29:21,725 --> 01:29:24,023
And they're gonna lead us right to the sub.

757
01:29:24,094 --> 01:29:26,722
Straight away. Splendid.

758
01:29:26,796 --> 01:29:29,765
It has to come to the surface and move in to the beach, doesn't it?

759
01:29:29,833 --> 01:29:32,233
Y eah, but if we miss them, we've had it.

760
01:29:32,302 --> 01:29:34,236
Bag them now and call that good.

761
01:29:34,304 --> 01:29:37,740
- I have lost contact with the truck.   - Ben, for God's sake.

762
01:29:39,009 --> 01:29:41,773
It's the reconnaissance pilot. He's lost contact.

763
01:30:13,843 --> 01:30:15,174
Quick   - get rid of that.

764
01:30:57,053 --> 01:30:58,987
Lost contact.

765
01:30:59,055 --> 01:31:03,992
Suggest immediate police surveillance north on Highway B828.

766
01:31:05,929 --> 01:31:09,126
- I'll get a plane myself.   - I'll arrange transport, sir.

767
01:31:44,467 --> 01:31:47,231
Where are you men going?

768
01:31:47,303 --> 01:31:50,704
Just going to make our Yank visitors comfy, Dad.

769
01:32:09,058 --> 01:32:10,525
Load of furniture...

770
01:32:10,593 --> 01:32:13,562
for the C.O. at the new American base at Mahaddie.

771
01:32:15,298 --> 01:32:17,323
Look.

772
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:19,834
Even a shower attachment for the silly bastard.

773
01:32:21,104 --> 01:32:23,197
It's five shillings.

774
01:32:24,040 --> 01:32:26,975
Heave up the tail! Good man.

775
01:33:11,521 --> 01:33:14,456
Won't be able to see a bloody thing after dark.

776
01:33:58,468 --> 01:33:59,799
Look-outs up there.

777
01:34:12,682 --> 01:34:13,671
All clear.

778
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,308
All clear.

779
01:34:17,487 --> 01:34:18,784
Camouflage the truck.

780
01:35:00,596 --> 01:35:04,726
This is White Lady 7.

781
01:35:04,801 --> 01:35:08,362
You are on a navy frequency, Flight 43. I have no authorization--

782
01:35:08,438 --> 01:35:12,204
I know that. I'm just tellin' you the sub will surface and sit there.

783
01:35:12,275 --> 01:35:14,607
Have any idea where that might be?

784
01:35:14,677 --> 01:35:17,703
Hell, no. If I knew, I wouldn't be guessin'.

785
01:35:31,461 --> 01:35:32,792
That's a waste of time.

786
01:35:32,862 --> 01:35:35,729
Let's drive it down this hole and get going.

787
01:35:43,005 --> 01:35:44,097
The boats first.

788
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:19,205
Have you gone crazy?

789
01:36:20,943 --> 01:36:21,910
Stop the truck!

790
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:39,059
What the hell is going on?

791
01:36:49,071 --> 01:36:50,834
Now what the hell?

792
01:36:52,608 --> 01:36:55,338
Do you see that? Go on down there.

793
01:37:21,237 --> 01:37:24,695
Burning rubbish I should say, sir. No sign of anything else.

794
01:37:48,498 --> 01:37:49,795
Go on ahead.

795
01:38:10,353 --> 01:38:13,481
This is White Lady 7.

796
01:38:13,556 --> 01:38:16,992
I've just completed a sweep of grid 16 X-ray.

797
01:38:17,059 --> 01:38:19,323
Sunset in 18 minutes.

798
01:38:19,395 --> 01:38:21,829
Will turn for home at that time.

E.T.A., 1930.

800
01:38:23,966 --> 01:38:25,558
Out.

801
01:39:06,742 --> 01:39:10,678
We have no flight plan for you, Flight 43. Return to base.

802
01:39:10,746 --> 01:39:14,614
- I say, you're not authorized.   - Where'd you get an idea like that?

803
01:39:14,684 --> 01:39:17,710
- Flight Control.   - They're pullin' your leg.

804
01:39:17,787 --> 01:39:21,985
Make another run offshore like a good fellow and I'll get you a medal.

805
01:40:27,256 --> 01:40:28,951
Hurry, I'm right behind you.

806
01:40:55,418 --> 01:40:58,819
There's the sub. Jesus, that's it!

807
01:40:58,888 --> 01:41:01,379
White Lady, this is Flight 43.

808
01:41:02,391 --> 01:41:05,087
Sub's off the point about a mile.

809
01:41:05,161 --> 01:41:07,686
About a mile! U-boat on the surface.

810
01:41:07,763 --> 01:41:09,390
Engine, full ahead.

811
01:41:20,176 --> 01:41:22,736
Go on down there. Buzz the hell out of 'em.

812
01:42:45,027 --> 01:42:48,190
Will you get in there. It'll submerge on you!

813
01:43:06,382 --> 01:43:10,751
Looks like we've been hit, sir. Better find a place to put her down.

814
01:44:59,995 --> 01:45:03,123
Asdic reports lost contact with U-boat. Request another sweep.

815
01:45:05,067 --> 01:45:07,262
This is White Lady 7 calling Madam.

816
01:45:10,673 --> 01:45:13,073

Bearing 045 off course head point...

818
01:45:16,278 --> 01:45:18,838
and boarding four prisoners who were abandoned.

819
01:45:18,914 --> 01:45:22,907
Will continue asdic sweep on 19 degrees aft from grid 13 easy.

820
01:45:22,985 --> 01:45:24,646
Request assistance.

821
01:45:26,155 --> 01:45:28,680
General Kerr calling Captain Connor.

822
01:45:32,461 --> 01:45:33,758
Come in, Connor.

823
01:45:35,531 --> 01:45:40,059
This is General Kerr calling Naval Frequency 453.

824
01:45:42,137 --> 01:45:45,732
Willi, looks like we're both in the shit house.

825
01:45:45,808 --> 01:45:49,107
General Kerr calling Captain Connor.

826
01:45:49,178 --> 01:45:50,975
Come in, Connor.
