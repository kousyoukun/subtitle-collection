1
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,435
Better call an ambulance.

2
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:45,769
- 5251, Chicago.
- 5251 .

3
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:47,834
Better send an ambulance
out to the Eisenhower...

4
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,801
in front of
the MacKenzie turnoff.

5
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:54,070
Got a wreck. We got coverage.
We'll send it in with the bike man.

6
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,768
- Ten-four.
- Okay.

7
00:01:57,966 --> 00:01:59,967
5251 , clear.

8
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:15,203
Now, that's his public posture,
but he's the one who's right there...

9
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:19,303
with his eyes glued to the screen
when the blood starts running--

10
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:22,535
And he's the one who says,
''Ooh, isn't i t horri ble?

11
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,069
Isn't it horrible?
Let me see some more.''

12
00:04:25,133 --> 00:04:27,201
There are a lot of people
who buy rhe New York rímes.

13
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:30,435
What l mean to say
is that it happens--

14
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,604
lt has happened always,
whether it was a photographer...

15
00:04:34,666 --> 00:04:37,468
or a journalist or a cameraman.

16
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,903
When you are in the middle
ofsomething happening, you--

17
00:04:40,966 --> 00:04:43,201
lt is a risk
ofthe profession.

18
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:47,370
What's the difference between a person
who types something and a typewriter?

19
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:50,435
The typewriter doesn't really care
about what's being typed.

20
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:54,703
But a typewriter's a machine,
and you're not a machine.

21
00:04:56,566 --> 00:04:59,802
Actually, l'm kind ofan elongation
ofa tape recorder.

22
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,469
l've made films on all kinds
ofsocial problems.

23
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:07,202
The big bombs were the ones
where we went into detail...

24
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,468
and showed
why something happened.

25
00:05:09,533 --> 00:05:12,802
Nobody wants to take the time. They'd
rather see 30 seconds ofsomebody...

26
00:05:12,866 --> 00:05:16,603
getting their skull cracked, turn off
the TV and say, ''Let me have a beer.''

27
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:18,968
But Hollywood, the news med--

28
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:23,137
Well, our position
is one to-- to record.

29
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,101
The dynamics that are
happening in society--

30
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,468
We don't deal
with the static things.

31
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:30,869
We deal with the violence.
We deal with--

32
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:34,269
Who wants to see somebody sitting,
to see somebody lying down...

33
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,369
somebody talking peace,
unless they're talking loud?

34
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,935
The cameraman
makes the choice himself.

35
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,502
He's out
to get the blood and guts.

36
00:05:42,566 --> 00:05:44,601
l believe that.
The other night on television...

37
00:05:44,666 --> 00:05:46,801
there was a fellow in Gay--
in the ghetto.

38
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:49,802
lf there's something else that maybe
is nice, that could fill the news...

39
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:53,869
he'll take the stabbing, even if
he's had 27 minutes ofstabbing before.

40
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,902
They're someplace safe,
away from it. They deplore it...

41
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:59,301
but they deplore it
like all good people.

42
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:03,236
All good people deplore problems
at a distance, like ThomasJefferson.

43
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,535
He loved the common man,
but at a distance.

44
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,301
This is exactly what happened.

45
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,335
Five cameramen have been killed,
one in Germany.

46
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:15,037
He was beat to death by a mob,
literally beat to death-- for UPl.

47
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,170
Know the excuse? The crowd thought
he was taking pictures for the police.

48
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:22,369
They had a couple of fellas
in a civil rights protest...

49
00:06:22,433 --> 00:06:25,536
that were chained together,
and l was taking pictures.

50
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,435
Cops said, ''Don't you think
you'd better load the camera?''

51
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,035
l says, ''l'm not out of film.''
They said, ''Load it anyway.

52
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,802
We wanna move these guys.''
And he starts pushing the lens.

53
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:35,235
l says, ''The next time you push me,
l'll fall down and start cying.''

54
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,934
He walked away.

55
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,303
The 1 20 Angineaux lens,
and yanking back and forth...

56
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:44,369
yelling ''Black Power'' at me,
and l'm just shaking to death...

57
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:46,968
with a $1 ,200 lens on the camera.

58
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:50,035
l am in the middle.
l got no place to hide.

59
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,637
l'm carying a 40-pound camera,
tying to get pictures of it.

60
00:06:54,699 --> 00:06:58,937
The rioter wants to beat me up, thinks
l'm tying to identi_ him for police.

61
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,902
The policeman wants to elbow me
out of the way...

62
00:07:01,966 --> 00:07:04,868
and l'm being gentle about it because
he doesn't want the sergeant to see...

63
00:07:04,933 --> 00:07:09,003
he picked up some guy by his neck
and threw him in the backseat ofa car.

64
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,701
Then the editor says,
''l want the pictures.

65
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:14,768
My audience doesn't care
what brought this on.''

66
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,669
You have to feed your family.
You need the money.

67
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,668
lfyou don't bring them back,
you're not going to have a job.

68
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:24,170
Forget that. l've got a job to do,
and l'm interested in it.

69
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:29,605
The point l resent vey much is the fact
that wherever l go, l'm beat up.

70
00:07:31,233 --> 00:07:33,835
Shoot into those troops!
Shoot 'em!

71
00:07:33,899 --> 00:07:36,602
Shoot the shit out of'em!
Get 'em!

72
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,367
You guys are shot!

73
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:41,102
What kind ofcounty is this?
What's wrong?

74
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:44,302
We're people! Why do you
have soldiers here with bayonets?

75
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,768
We got a captive. Hold on.

76
00:07:58,766 --> 00:08:04,004
That was an unprovoked attack
that was retaliatoy--

77
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,534
Not me. Not me.

78
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,269
This man has an obsolete weapon.

79
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:10,401
Make love, not war.

80
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,769
They stabbed one ofour guys
in the belly.

81
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:18,203
l am Brigadier General
Richard T. Dunn...

82
00:08:18,266 --> 00:08:21,769
commanding general of the
emergency operation headquarters...

83
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,635
of the Illinois Army
National Guard.

84
00:08:25,233 --> 00:08:27,101
The emergency operation
headquarters...

85
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:30,769
is one which
was established last winter...

86
00:08:30,833 --> 00:08:34,503
for the purpose of planning
and controlling operations...

87
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:36,901
in the event
ofcivil disturbances.

88
00:08:37,966 --> 00:08:39,634
Over.

89
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,302
Out in the street,
their bayonets are fixed...

90
00:08:42,366 --> 00:08:46,870
and they know it's for real
in a real riot in the city.

91
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:49,335
And here we know
it's more or less--

92
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:51,335
lt's a war game, more or less.

93
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,734
How's it going so far?

94
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:55,102
l couldn't tell you.
l'm the enemy.

95
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,468
We love you guys.

96
00:08:59,033 --> 00:09:01,802
We have women foryou, beer.

97
00:09:01,866 --> 00:09:04,201
Come ont

98
00:09:04,266 --> 00:09:08,236
- Sing it, now.
- Gloy, gloy, hallelujah

99
00:09:16,066 --> 00:09:20,437
His truth is marching on

100
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,069
- When do we want freedom?
- Now!

101
00:09:23,133 --> 00:09:25,902
- When do we want equality?
- Now!

102
00:09:25,966 --> 00:09:28,401
- When are we gonna get it?
- Now!

103
00:09:28,466 --> 00:09:32,036
lt is what our forefathers fought for--
the free choice of people!

104
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,367
Yeah!

105
00:09:34,433 --> 00:09:36,434
This county is changing.

106
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,535
lt is no longer
for all the people.

107
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,103
- It is for some ofthe people.
- Yeah!

108
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:45,335
- We see a warwe do not want.
- Yeah!

109
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:48,202
We see an apathy towards
Iove and brotherhood.

110
00:09:48,266 --> 00:09:49,400
Yeah!

111
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,502
- Bring out the mayor.
- We want the mayor!

112
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:57,203
- Hold on.
- We want the mayor!

113
00:09:57,266 --> 00:09:59,968
We want the mayor!

114
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:07,602
We'll bring thejudge
out to talk to you.

115
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:11,002
We want the mayor!
We don't want a _unky!

116
00:10:11,066 --> 00:10:13,168
We want the mayor!

117
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:18,235
My friends,
l've stood before you many times.

118
00:10:18,299 --> 00:10:20,335
Tell it to 'em, Mayor!

119
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:25,204
You elected me mayor ofthis town
for the last 20 years.

120
00:10:25,266 --> 00:10:27,234
- No,wedidn't!
- Tell itto 'em!

121
00:10:28,833 --> 00:10:32,636
We've given you eveything
that we thought you needed.

122
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:39,203
l've let you use our swimming pool
evey 4th ofJuly.

123
00:10:39,266 --> 00:10:41,668
We want it evey day ofthe year!

124
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,301
We've operated--

125
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:48,336
We've operated the liquor store
with a minimum of profit.

126
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,002
Sock it to 'em, baby!
Sock it to 'em.

127
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:55,670
l u ndersta nd that
you have some problems.

128
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:02,137
- You have avoided our problems!
- l understand that you have--

129
00:11:03,766 --> 00:11:06,902
l u ndersta nd that
you have some complaints.

130
00:11:07,966 --> 00:11:12,136
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

131
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,470
We shall overcome

132
00:11:25,299 --> 00:11:30,138
Some day

133
00:11:54,566 --> 00:11:55,967
Yeah

134
00:11:59,066 --> 00:12:01,168
Get the guys with the cameras.

135
00:12:11,366 --> 00:12:14,936
Four, three, two, one.

136
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,636
Fade in.
Richard starts back.

137
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:23,202
And cue a n nou nce.
And keep on coming.

138
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,269
- And hold.
- What's wrong?

139
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:30,669
Now.
Down and in slowly.

140
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:32,367
Vey slowly.

141
00:12:34,533 --> 00:12:36,868
You riding iris on this,
Jery, or what?

142
00:12:39,399 --> 00:12:42,035
Slate on one.
Stand by to take.

143
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,402
Roll tape to record.
In, Arnold.

144
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,269
- Stand by.
- Four, three...

145
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,201
two, one.

146
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:56,001
Fade in.

147
00:13:03,733 --> 00:13:06,168
You want to move
over here, please?

148
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,802
Let's go. Time is money.
Let's go.

149
00:13:08,866 --> 00:13:11,935
Gus, is the El too loud foryou?

150
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,968
No, we can live with it.

151
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,934
Who here
is old enough to vote?

152
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,535
l took my physical last week.

153
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,535
Physical to vote?

154
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,370
- Why are you working for Kennedy?
- He's the best.

155
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,968
- He's got long hair.
- He's against the war.

156
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:33,368
- What are you doing here?
- She's my friend.

157
00:13:33,433 --> 00:13:37,236
He's an idealist. He's for anyone
who hasn't got a chance.

158
00:13:37,299 --> 00:13:41,103
- Who are you for?
- l don't like him because of Oswald...

159
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,268
and Dallas and all that.

160
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,935
What does that have
to do with it?

161
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,302
l think he should have
Iooked into it.

162
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:50,735
There's a lot ofserious questions
that haven't been answered.

163
00:13:50,799 --> 00:13:53,269
\nthe Saturday Evening Post
there was a statement...

164
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,335
that the CIA knew about
Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico...

165
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,069
only two months
beforeJohn Kennedy--

166
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,135
May l help you?

167
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,502
Damn it. It looks
like l'm a prime target.

168
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,169
First the hubcaps,
now my radio antenna.

169
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,467
Rotten kids.

170
00:15:40,533 --> 00:15:43,969
What's the difference? Channel Eight's
got more where these came from.

171
00:15:44,033 --> 00:15:46,201
That's not the point.

172
00:15:46,266 --> 00:15:47,700
What?

173
00:15:49,533 --> 00:15:52,769
- Where do you want to go?
- How about a movie?

174
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,568
Come on. Go after her!

175
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:27,201
Attagirl!

176
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:31,502
ln the crotch! Atta baby!
In the crotch!

177
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,767
Kill her!

178
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,268
- Kill her!
- Pull her hair!

179
00:17:45,733 --> 00:17:48,435
- Tie her up!
- Kick her in the back!

180
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,268
Kick her in the back!

181
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,667
Yea!

182
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,935
Let's see some action!

183
00:17:58,133 --> 00:18:00,201
You'rejust a chicken!

184
00:18:06,033 --> 00:18:08,034
Go to work. Go to work.

185
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,367
Go! Go! Go!

186
00:18:43,099 --> 00:18:45,602
- No cheating.
- Goes foryou too.

187
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,368
That's right.

188
00:18:48,433 --> 00:18:50,067
All right.
Deuces are wild, Robert.

189
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:53,768
Whoops.

190
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,501
All right.
Show him what to do.

191
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,102
Now, deuces are wild, Robert.

192
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:11,002
They count as anything
you want 'em to.

193
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,435
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

194
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,536
Take this one.
Throw the rest away.

195
00:19:16,599 --> 00:19:18,368
- This?
- How many you want?

196
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:22,003
- l want four.
- Four?

197
00:19:22,066 --> 00:19:24,334
- How many you want?
- Five.

198
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,201
You mean four.

199
00:19:27,733 --> 00:19:29,568
No cheating, now.

200
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,103
- Two aces. What do you got?
- l got two treys.

201
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:39,901
Two treys.

202
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:44,702
- What'd you do? You throw--
- l got two aces.

203
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,301
You throwed down
my three nines down, didn't you?

204
00:19:47,366 --> 00:19:49,067
No, he got 'em.

205
00:19:49,133 --> 00:19:51,168
l didn't get 'em.
They're in the deck.

206
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:55,435
He threw 'em down.

207
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,768
Boy, it's hot.
You got anything to drink?

208
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,635
Miss Horton,
you have anything to drink?

209
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,436
- There's plenty ofwater in the sink.
- l don't want any water.

210
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,036
l want a Coke or something.
Let's go get a Coke, Robert.

211
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,468
We'll see you there.

212
00:20:26,366 --> 00:20:29,368
- Where'd your friends go?
- To get a Coke.

213
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,134
Get a Coke?

214
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,303
- What was you playing?
- Deuces wild.

215
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,768
- Who won?
- Nobody.

216
00:20:39,833 --> 00:20:41,601
Nobody.

217
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:44,168
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

218
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:47,835
You're pretty dirty.
You've been working them birds.

219
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,969
You'd better go wash up
before we eat supper.

220
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:55,768
Well, go on.

221
00:20:57,233 --> 00:20:59,101
Go on, now. Get.

222
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:45,701
We thank Thee, Lord,
for this food.

223
00:21:45,766 --> 00:21:49,202
Bless it to the nourishment
ofour bodies. In Thy name we pray.

224
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,567
Amen.

Roll it up.

May be the last time
but l don't know

Well, it may be the last time
you march on the capitol

241
00:23:33,966 --> 00:23:36,535
Well, it may be the last time
you march on Congress

Well, it may be the last time

Appalachia.
You see the sign?

245
00:23:48,866 --> 00:23:51,101
- Could we get a drink ofwater first?
- To hell with the water.

246
00:23:51,166 --> 00:23:53,334
Let's find this guy.

247
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,535
They're behind the Mexicans,
ain't they?

248
00:23:57,599 --> 00:24:01,170
l heard they were behind
the San Francisco contingent.

249
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:04,736
- This is in this direction here.
- l thought it was a blue tent.

250
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,935
l don't know how these people
listen to this crap.

l don't know how long
this is gonna keep going.

- Well, where is it?
- Let's go this way.

253
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:38,236
l would hope, now that
the California primay is finished...

now that these primaries are over...

255
00:24:40,233 --> 00:24:43,069
that we cou Id now concentrate
on having a dialogue...

256
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:47,036
or a debate, l hope,
between the vice president and myself...

257
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:48,734
ofwhat direction
we wa nt to go i n.

258
00:24:56,533 --> 00:24:58,668
Mayor Yorty hasjust
sent me a message...

259
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:01,001
that we've been here
too long already.

- We love you, Bob.
- My thanks to all ofyou...

261
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,002
and now it's on to Chicago,
and let's win there.

262
00:25:13,133 --> 00:25:14,968
We want Bobby!

263
00:25:21,433 --> 00:25:24,903
Oh, no
l don't believe it

264
00:25:24,966 --> 00:25:29,370
You say that you think
you know the meaning of love

265
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:36,069
You say love is all we need

266
00:25:36,133 --> 00:25:38,802
You say with your love

267
00:25:38,866 --> 00:25:43,136
You could change all ofthe fools
a Il ofthe hate

268
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,670
l think you're probably
out to lunch

269
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:58,002
You guys here
to cover the funeral?

270
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,201
Yeah, that's what we're here for.

271
00:26:00,266 --> 00:26:03,802
l didn't hearyou
come in last night.

272
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,535
You score?

273
00:26:09,633 --> 00:26:11,901
You left the TV set on.

274
00:26:15,133 --> 00:26:18,903
You know, you can meet a lot of
interesting people in a cocktail lounge.

275
00:26:20,466 --> 00:26:24,036
You know that for evey man in D.C.,
there are four and a halfwomen?

276
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:33,936
lt's a beautiful city, huh?
Wow. Beautiful.

277
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,069
Boy, this air-conditioning
really gets you.

278
00:26:44,266 --> 00:26:46,267
Look at these guys.

279
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,135
Couple of hours,
they're all set up.

280
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,336
Twenty, twenty-five camera positions--
like nothing.

281
00:27:03,366 --> 00:27:06,102
They've had experience
since we did J.F.K. in '63.

282
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,168
Hello, ladies.

283
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,134
What are your plans
for the summer--

284
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:48,969
this, which will be
a vey political summer...

285
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:50,667
and possibly a vey hot one.

286
00:27:50,733 --> 00:27:52,935
Oh, well, now,
Iet's not get into politics.

287
00:27:54,099 --> 00:27:58,404
Well, we always go up
to our place...

288
00:27:58,466 --> 00:28:03,137
up in Ontario, up in Canada.

289
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,402
lt's a place called Desbras.

290
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:07,935
That's D-E-S. It's French.

291
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,901
lt's not like a girl's name.

292
00:28:09,966 --> 00:28:13,235
And, well, about this time ofyear,
we always start looking forward...

293
00:28:13,299 --> 00:28:18,371
to getting away from the city
and the crowds and the heat.

294
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:21,402
lt's vey primitive up there.

295
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:25,570
And l think sometimes
it's good for the soul...

296
00:28:25,633 --> 00:28:25,633
to get away from civilization,
don't you think so?

298
00:28:52,666 --> 00:28:54,768
- Hello.
- Hello.

299
00:28:54,833 --> 00:28:58,503
- Is your mother home?
- Yes. No.

300
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:02,069
- No? Is she working?
- Yes.

301
00:29:02,133 --> 00:29:05,069
What time will she be home?

302
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:07,969
- At 1 2:OO.
- l see.

303
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:12,070
- Now, how long have you lived here?
- l don't know.

304
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:13,300
- You don't know?
- No.

305
00:29:13,366 --> 00:29:16,102
Could you tell me where you lived
before you moved here?

306
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:18,668
- Yes.
- Where?

307
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:23,137
- West Virginia.
- l see.

308
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,435
Now, how many rooms do you have?

309
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,236
- No-- yeah. Four.
- Four rooms.

00:30:03,833 --> 00:30:05,301
At Vietnam.

323
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,802
Let's go see
what damage we done up here.

324
00:30:15,466 --> 00:30:18,669
- Look at the holes there.
- Golly!

325
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,734
Look around and see
ifyou can find another.

326
00:30:23,866 --> 00:30:26,501
Hell, l got something here.
Come here.

327
00:30:26,566 --> 00:30:29,268

00:30:29,333 --> 00:30:30,901
Drink this.

329
00:30:39,666 --> 00:30:41,267
Come on.

330
00:30:44,633 --> 00:30:46,601
- You want to shoot it?
- Uh-uh.

331
00:30:46,666 --> 00:30:50,403
lt ain't gonna hurt you.
Just put a shell in like that.

332
00:30:50,466 --> 00:30:53,402
- It's safe. It won't hurt you at all.
- l don't want to shoot it.

333
00:30:53,466 --> 00:30:55,434
Draw it back.

334
00:30:56,566 --> 00:30:59,201
Knock it offof there.
That's all you got to do.

335

You out ofshape, pal?
What's in the basket?

00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:21,700
Dinner.

340
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:45,003
Why don't you admit it?
Go on.Just say it.

341
00:32:45,133 --> 00:32:47,401
You're a bastard.

342
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,868
Admit it to me.

343
00:32:52,933 --> 00:32:55,902
Admit it to yourself.

344
00:32:55,966 --> 00:33:00,537
You're a rotten,
egotistical, selfish...

345
00:33:03,333 --> 00:33:05,401
punchy cameraman.

346
00:33:11,766 --> 00:33:13,033
Well?

347
00:33:16,599 --> 00:33:18,034
Well? Well?

348
00:33:23,466 --> 00:33:25,968
Look at this here. Look.

349
00:33:27,333 --> 00:33:29,802
How do you like it?
Gus wired it up for me.

350
00:33:29,866 --> 00:33:34,370
Look back there.
Fiber optics. Great, huh?

351
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,035
See the TV? Lights.

352
00:33:38,099 --> 00:33:40,969
- Look at that.
-John.

353
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:46,270
Do you remember
whgnwg saw Mondo Cane?

354
00:33:46,333 --> 00:33:50,270
- We didn't see Mondo C_ne.
- Well, l saw it.

355
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:52,735
l saw it, too, but l don't
remember seeing it with you.

356
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:57,602
Well, anyway,
that's not the point.

357
00:33:57,666 --> 00:33:59,768
What's the point?

358
00:34:00,833 --> 00:34:03,435
Well, you remember that scene...

359
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,202
on an island,
where they tested an atom bomb?

360
00:34:06,266 --> 00:34:07,967
Yeah.

361
00:34:08,033 --> 00:34:11,436
Well, there were
these big turtles...

362
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:15,270
you know, tortoises, who,
at a certain time in their lives...

363
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:19,336
would walk to the sea
to lay their eggs.

364
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,869
And they found that
the radiation thing...

365
00:34:21,933 --> 00:34:24,101
threw the turtles'
sense ofdirection...

366
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:27,969
so instead of heading to the sea,
they went inland and died.

367
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,435
Oh, l'm cying.

368
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:35,034
Damn it!

369
00:34:35,099 --> 00:34:37,869
Look, somebody
took those movies, right?

370
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:41,102
l mean, doyou think
did they or didn't they...

371
00:34:41,166 --> 00:34:44,736
after they took those movies--

372
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,370
Do you think-- Did they reach down
and turn those turtles around...

373
00:34:49,366 --> 00:34:52,035
or did they put them in ajeep
and drive them back?

374
00:34:52,099 --> 00:34:55,636
How the hell do l know what they did?
Those were Italian cameramen.

375
00:34:59,433 --> 00:35:02,169
l give up. l surrender.

376
00:35:07,966 --> 00:35:09,834
No calories.

377
00:35:11,466 --> 00:35:13,768
l'd rather
keep my kidneys for a while.

''Research physicians at the lstituto

380
00:35:29,566 --> 00:35:32,035
involving a new device to be worn
by expectant mothers...

381

during the entire course
of their pregnancy.

382
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:37,903
This device consists
ofa steel and plastic cylinder...

383
00:35:37,966 --> 00:35:40,968
which can be controlled
to create a partial vacuum...

384
00:35:41,033 --> 00:35:45,570
around the mother's abdomen, reducing
atmospheric pressure on the fetus.

385
00:35:46,633 --> 00:35:48,401
This pressure--

386
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:54,302
which is at sea level
1 4.7 pounds per square inch--

387
00:35:54,366 --> 00:35:57,168
can be reduced by as much as 500x.

director of
the hospital's research institute...

who first made public the results
of the test involving the new device.

391
00:36:05,433 --> 00:36:08,769
Although it is anticipated
that the price...

392
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,734
in the early stages
ofdevelopment, at least...

We sure starve a lot
when the stamps run out.

431

Trouble is, you can't
get no ''tobaccy'' on stamps.

432
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,367
So you know about the stamps.

Ten-four. Ten-four.

438
00:41:00,033 --> 00:41:02,802
l could've let the bird go.
He would've flown back...

439
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:05,535
but l don't know how he would've
carried the basket.

440
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:07,902
lt might've flown back
to West Virginia.

441
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:10,768
Harold spends all his time
tying to retrain him.

442
00:41:10,833 --> 00:41:13,235
- How long you been up here?
- Not too long.

He did, huh? Yeah, all right.

448
00:41:46,366 --> 00:41:48,534
Anything else?

449
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:50,835
All right. Thankyou.

450
00:41:56,233 --> 00:42:01,104
You tell Harold the bad guy from

451
00:42:02,966 --> 00:42:06,169
- You tell him. Hear?
- l will.

452
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,501
You mind turning this off?

453

We're gonna make sound.
Would you shut this off?

- Shut it off!
- All right.

455
00:42:27,533 --> 00:42:30,535
Where was the money really located?

456
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,601
Was it stuffed in the seat?

457
00:42:32,666 --> 00:42:35,035
lt was in an envelope
on the floor.

458
00:42:35,099 --> 00:42:37,035
What kind ofenvelope?

459
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:41,201
What kind ofan envelope was it?

460
00:42:41,266 --> 00:42:43,468
Ask him.
He's counting the money there.

461
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:46,669
He's counting the money.
How much money is it?

462
00:42:46,733 --> 00:42:49,302
- How much money is it?
- Don't ask him.

463
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:51,701
l want to know from you.
How much money did you have?

464
00:42:51,766 --> 00:42:54,768
How much did you count?
Did you count the money?

465
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,602
- $1 o,ooo.
- You sure it was $1 O,OOO?

466
00:42:57,666 --> 00:43:00,268
lt wasn't 9,OOO? Wasn't 1 1 ,OOO?

467
00:43:00,333 --> 00:43:03,169
9,OOO? $1 O,OOO, right?

468
00:43:03,233 --> 00:43:07,236
lt was 9,OOO. l put 1 ,OOO ofmine
to make it 1 O,OOO.

469
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:09,101
What you gonna do?
Get funny now?

470
00:43:09,166 --> 00:43:12,202
Gonna start putting me on?
Let's not play games with each other.

471
00:43:12,266 --> 00:43:17,170
l'm here to find out why you
turned in $1 O,OOO. Where did you get it?

472
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:20,970
Aren't you thankful
l did turn in $ 1 O,OOO?

473
00:43:21,033 --> 00:43:24,269
Maybe not. l'm a policeman.
l'm just here to find out the facts.

474
00:44:18,099 --> 00:44:22,971
Just tell her we coverthe news.
We do not manufacture violence.

475
00:44:23,033 --> 00:44:25,034
Talk to her, okay?

476
00:44:27,533 --> 00:44:27,533
Mrs. Harris, l'm re-- Well?

478
00:44:31,199 --> 00:44:33,569
Remember the shot of the cabby
who turned the money in?

479
00:44:33,633 --> 00:44:36,268
- Forget it.
- There's a stoy there, Carlin.

480
00:44:36,333 --> 00:44:39,969
A lot of people are interested.
l think it'll go on the Sunday reports.

481
00:44:40,033 --> 00:44:43,369
No. l got a convention
coming up, a war...

482
00:44:43,433 --> 00:44:46,469
l got baseball,
a nervous city...

483
00:44:46,533 --> 00:44:49,135
plus l got chickenshit cameramen
that are afraid...

484
00:44:49,199 --> 00:44:51,669
to go into the ghetto
without police protection.

485
00:44:51,733 --> 00:44:55,837
No. Stay out
of those neighborhoods...

486
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,268
until l send you in there.

487
00:44:57,333 --> 00:45:00,035
- l want film and lab.
- They got film.

488
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:04,471
- l want film and lab.
- Would you please stop bothering me?

489
00:45:04,533 --> 00:45:07,836
Mr. Evans's office on line six.

490
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,337
Write up a voucher.
Yes, sir. Good morning.

491
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,337
Hey, TV man.
Are we gonna be on TV?

492
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,102
We wanna be on TV.

493
00:45:19,166 --> 00:45:23,370
- TV, that's for us.
- Hey, TV man! What's happening?

494
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:27,303
...slaughtered Philadelphia 9-O.

495
00:45:27,366 --> 00:45:30,669
And finally, it was the Mets
walloping the Pirates.

496
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,501
- Locked?
- Yeah.

497
00:45:38,133 --> 00:45:41,436
-You know you're two blocks away?
-l had some trouble in there last night.

498
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,435
Thought we'd keep the equipment safe.

499
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,102
White bread on sandwiches
is not too cool.

500
00:45:49,166 --> 00:45:54,104
- Come on, now.
- No. That's out of it. O-U-T. Out.

501
00:45:54,166 --> 00:45:57,135
l don't think we have any other kind,
but l'll take a look-see.

502
00:45:58,366 --> 00:46:01,936
Frank, l dug your name
in the paper.

503
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,170
You're somewhat ofa celebrity now.
Want to fill me in?

504
00:46:06,233 --> 00:46:07,901
Well, l'm not
really a celebrity...

505
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:13,204
but, yeah, l found the bread,
and l turned it in.

506
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:14,834
- You turned it in.
- Uh-huh.

507
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,003
Were you acting as a Negro
or a black man?

508
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,134
l'm concerned about this.

509
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:22,302
What do you mean, was l acting
as a Negro or black man?

510
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:26,036
lfyou were acting as a black man,
you would've kept the money.

511
00:46:26,099 --> 00:46:29,837
lfyou were acting as a Negro,
you turned it in.

512
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:33,637
You're my man.
You're my man and eveything.

513
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:36,869
- How much money was that?
- $1 o,ooo.

514
00:46:36,933 --> 00:46:39,535
$1 O,OOO? You kidding?

515
00:46:40,333 --> 00:46:42,368
Dig, now, look. You know--

516
00:46:42,433 --> 00:46:46,737
Do you realize
how much ammunition and guns...

517
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:50,069
$1 O,OOO would've bought?

518
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:52,335
Well, l'm not quite there yet.

519
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,303
But l'm talking about,
you got to be alive to be honest.

520
00:46:57,566 --> 00:47:00,702
- What you doing around here, man?
-Just buying some cigarettes.

521
00:47:00,766 --> 00:47:04,269
You ain't got no right coming here
to buy no cigarettes.

522
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:11,070
Guys like you get shot all up,
you know?

523
00:47:11,133 --> 00:47:14,503
-Yeah.
-Don't come here for cigarettes.

524
00:47:14,566 --> 00:47:16,467
You know what l mean?

525
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,202
We have a visitor.

526
00:48:03,266 --> 00:48:06,102
- Frank Baker live here?
- Frank Baker live here?

527
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:09,536
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?

528
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:12,202
- Does he live here?
- Does he live here?

529
00:48:12,266 --> 00:48:15,569
- Yeah. Does he live here?
- Does he live here?

530
00:48:15,633 --> 00:48:18,002
There's no Frank cabdriver here.

531
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,138
You don't know him? He's a cabdriver.
l did a stoy on him. l'm a reporter.

532
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:28,669
- What's his name again?
- Frank Baker.

533
00:48:28,733 --> 00:48:31,902
- Frank Baker.
- Come on. You're putting the guy on.

534
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:34,368
This is the guy
who put me on television.

535
00:48:34,433 --> 00:48:36,935
- How you doing?
- Vey well. l don't want to bust in.

536
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,569
l just wondered
ifyou got five minutes to talk.

537
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,035
- Let's do it over a drink.
- Good.

538
00:48:51,566 --> 00:48:54,835
You know, Chicago cops...

539
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:57,469
are getting
funnier-looking evey day.

540
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:03,869
- l'm not a cop. l'm a soundman.
- Betyou got credentials too.

541
00:49:03,933 --> 00:49:07,336
The FBl supplies
the best credentials.

542
00:49:08,533 --> 00:49:10,968
We know
that one of the best ways...

543
00:49:11,033 --> 00:49:14,636
for spying on black people
is to impersonate TV men.

544
00:49:14,699 --> 00:49:16,868
We're talking to Frank
about doing a stoy.

545
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:19,602
- Yeah? What's that?
- That's my Pageboy.

546
00:49:21,099 --> 00:49:24,169
- Your Pageboy?
- Yeah.

547
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,237
Hey, Richard,
come and dig this cat's Pageboy.

548
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:34,270
Now, what do you do
with ''my Pageboy''?

549
00:49:34,333 --> 00:49:36,068
Well, l don't do anything.
Itjust hangs there.

550
00:49:36,133 --> 00:49:40,136
lf they want me to go someplace
or do something, they call me on it.

551
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:45,204
You mean,
they give you orders on this.

552
00:49:45,266 --> 00:49:47,201
Yeah.

553
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:54,370
Man, you mean to tell me they talk
toyou, and you can't talk back?

554
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:58,535
He means he's a receiver
and not a sender.

555
00:50:00,699 --> 00:50:03,335
Looks like they're
calling you now.

556
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,301
What, you a white flunky
or something?

557
00:50:05,366 --> 00:50:09,103
Wrong. You got a bad idea about--

558
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:12,002
l forgot something downstairs.
l'll meet you in the car.

559
00:50:12,066 --> 00:50:13,600
All right.

560
00:50:13,666 --> 00:50:16,402
Coming back.
He's coming back.

561
00:50:16,466 --> 00:50:19,302
There he goes.
There he goes.

562
00:50:19,366 --> 00:50:21,301
A honky flunky.

563
00:50:23,433 --> 00:50:25,768
Look, man,
l've been on television...

564
00:50:25,833 --> 00:50:29,803
l've been in the newspapers,
and it's made my life total confusion.

565
00:50:29,866 --> 00:50:34,303
l find $1 O,OOO in a cab.
l'm boob enough to turn it in...

566
00:50:34,366 --> 00:50:36,735
and l get my butt kicked
by eveybody in the world.

567
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:40,003
- No, man.
- That'sjust it, Frank.

568
00:50:40,066 --> 00:50:43,502
lt's a human interest stoy.
People identi_.

569
00:50:43,566 --> 00:50:45,801
- It'll be constructive.
- Are you coming, Frank?

570
00:50:45,866 --> 00:50:48,735
l'll giveyou a call, and
we'll have another talk about it.

571
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,134
Thankyou.

572
00:50:51,266 --> 00:50:54,836
Excuse me, TV man, you wanted
someone for an interview, right?

573
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,701
l haven't got time
right now, dear. l gotta run.

574
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:59,802
But l wanted to talk to you.
See, l'm a black actress.

575
00:50:59,866 --> 00:51:02,969
- Listen, honey-- l haven't got time--
- Don't ''honey'' me.

576
00:51:03,033 --> 00:51:07,203
l'm a black actress.
l demand respect. l'm not looking for--

577
00:51:07,266 --> 00:51:11,536
- You call the station.
- No. You said you wanted somebody.

578
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,669
You want to hear-- know what's
going on, what black people are doing?

579
00:51:14,733 --> 00:51:17,335
- l'm not interested.
- Wait, wait.

580
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:21,504
- Don't ''honey'' me.
- You got to start respecting our women.

581
00:51:21,566 --> 00:51:25,636
l have no disrespect in mind.
l gotta leave. l don't have time.

582
00:51:25,699 --> 00:51:28,302
l want to talk to you
about what l'd like to do.

583
00:51:28,366 --> 00:51:32,870
You people are always busy
putting your kind of people on.

584
00:51:32,933 --> 00:51:35,201
l want to talk to you
about what l want.

585
00:51:35,266 --> 00:51:38,202
- Listen, dear.
- l told you about that ''dear.''

586
00:51:38,266 --> 00:51:41,802
- l'm tying to be vey respectful.
- We demand--

587
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:41,866
- You demand what?
- Demand respect.

589
00:51:47,633 --> 00:51:49,267
- Handle it.

590
00:51:49,333 --> 00:51:53,470
- Don't call me ''honey.''
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

591
00:51:53,533 --> 00:51:57,370
-This is the guy that came by the house.
-l know the guy.

592
00:51:57,433 --> 00:52:00,636
So don't give him a bad time.

593
00:52:00,699 --> 00:52:02,301
Leave him alone.
He's all right.

594
00:52:02,366 --> 00:52:04,768
- Come on, baby.
- He's a jive--

595
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:09,537
Wait a minute.
l want to talk to you. Come in.

596
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,235
Let me askyou something.
Are you being friendly?

597
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:16,103
Am l being friendly?
l just saved your life.

598
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,902
- If l got to be afraid--
- You understand l just saved your life?

599
00:52:18,966 --> 00:52:23,303
lf l got to be afraid foryour argument
to work, you got no argument.

600
00:52:23,366 --> 00:52:26,535
l want you to understand
l saved your life.

601
00:52:26,599 --> 00:52:30,904
You came down here to do some sort
ofjive interview.

602
00:52:30,966 --> 00:52:36,104
You did that. Came down here with
1 5 minutes ofa black sensibility...

603
00:52:36,166 --> 00:52:38,301
and so you don't understand that.

604
00:52:38,366 --> 00:52:40,101
You came down here
to shoot 1 5 minutes...

605
00:52:40,166 --> 00:52:43,068
ofwhat has taken 300 years
to develop.

606
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:45,335
- Grief, you know?
- l'm not interested in grief--

607
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,604
All we're tying to explain to you
is that you don't understand.

608
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,335
l do something.
l do it well. That's myjob.

609
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:57,037
You don't do it black enough. You can't,
because you're not black. We are.

610
00:52:57,099 --> 00:53:01,103
When you come and say you've come
to do something of human interest...

611
00:53:01,166 --> 00:53:04,569
it makes a person wonder whether
you're going to do something...

612
00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:08,837
of interest to other humans, or whether
you consider the person human...

613
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:10,735
in whom you're interested.

614
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:13,836
You have
to understand that too.

615
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,637
You can'tjust walk in
out ofyour arrogance...

616
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:20,202
and expect things
to be like they are...

617
00:53:20,266 --> 00:53:22,868
because when you walked in,
you brought La Salle Street with you...

618
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:27,504
City Hall and all
the mass communications media.

619
00:53:27,566 --> 00:53:31,336
And you are the exploiters.
You're the ones who distort...

620
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:36,938
and ridicule and emasculate us,
and that ain't cool.

621
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,269
You don't want to know, man.
You don't know the people.

622
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:42,568
You don't show the people.

623
00:53:42,633 --> 00:53:45,302
Here's some cat
who's down and out, you dig?

624
00:53:45,366 --> 00:53:47,835
He's nobody,
so he says to his old man...

625
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:51,503
''l'm nobody. l'm gonna die,

626
00:53:51,566 --> 00:53:54,068
and ain't nobody
gonna know l lived,'' dig?

627
00:53:54,133 --> 00:53:58,203
So the cat finds a brick and
throws it through Charlie's window...

628
00:53:58,266 --> 00:54:01,502
or he takes a gun
and he shoots.

629
00:54:01,566 --> 00:54:04,869
Then the cat lives, man.
He really lives, dig?

630
00:54:04,933 --> 00:54:07,802
A hundred million people
see the cat on the tube.

631
00:54:07,866 --> 00:54:10,535
They say,
''The former invisible man lives.''

632
00:54:10,599 --> 00:54:14,971
Eveybody knows about his wife
and kids-- eveything, you dig?

633
00:54:15,033 --> 00:54:19,804
'Cause the tube is life, man. Life.

634
00:54:19,866 --> 00:54:24,270
You make him an Emmy, man.
You make him the TV star ofthe hour...

635
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:28,270
on the 6:OO, the 1 O:OO
and the 1 2:OO news.

636
00:54:28,333 --> 00:54:30,635
'Cause what the cat is saying
is truth, man.

637
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:34,336
Why don't you find out
what really is?

638
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,468
Why you always got to wait
till somebody gets killed?

639
00:54:36,533 --> 00:54:38,334
'Cause somebody is gonna get killed.

640
00:54:59,866 --> 00:55:01,901
ls that thing loaded?

641
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:03,467
As a matter of fact,
they call it a shotgun.

642
00:55:03,533 --> 00:55:05,534
lt looks about 1 2-gauge.

643
00:55:07,866 --> 00:55:10,001
- Let's go over here.
- Okay.

644
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:14,903
There's a good background.
Vey good.

645
00:55:14,966 --> 00:55:17,234
- We can't shoot here.
- What do you mean?

646
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,602
Too noisy.
Those gunshots will wipe us out.

647
00:55:19,666 --> 00:55:24,037
lt's always too noisy, isn't it?
Let's go back over here.

648
00:55:24,099 --> 00:55:26,836
- Good foryou?
- Yeah, fine.

649
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,502
- Pepsi machine. Good enough?
- Fine.

650
00:55:30,566 --> 00:55:32,467
Excuse me.

651
00:55:32,533 --> 00:55:35,969
- What do l do now?
-Just speak in a normal tone ofvoice.

652
00:55:36,033 --> 00:55:38,335
Rolling here. Rolling.

653
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:41,503
Well, there's been
about a 460x increase...

654
00:55:41,566 --> 00:55:44,135
in pistol registration
since last year's riot.

655
00:55:44,199 --> 00:55:46,135
We're getting our business
from people...

656
00:55:46,199 --> 00:55:49,169
who want to
protect their families and homes.

657
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:51,301
- Can you hold on a minute?
- Excuse me.

658
00:55:51,366 --> 00:55:54,268
- The damn thing's stuck.
- Point that down.

659
00:55:54,333 --> 00:55:58,003
l've only got one head.
There we go. See? This release.

660
00:55:58,066 --> 00:55:59,534
There. Okay?

661
00:56:00,966 --> 00:56:03,201
- Thankyou.
- There you go.

662
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:07,868
- Not bad.
- You ready again?

663
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:09,901
You want to start again?

664
00:56:10,966 --> 00:56:13,501
Well, l don't know
what you're looking for.

665
00:56:13,566 --> 00:56:15,868
lfa person
has a driver's license...

666
00:56:15,933 --> 00:56:18,535
he has to know how to drive.

667
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,937
lfa person gets a gun,
he has to know how to use it.

668
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:27,838
How he uses it orwhat he uses it for
is a personal right.

669
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:32,400
Sory.

670
00:56:32,466 --> 00:56:34,835
- Dick, let me have a dime.
- Sure,John.

671
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:40,835
There you go.

672
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:44,570
l asked him where he was.
He said, ''l was on vacation.''

673
00:56:44,633 --> 00:56:46,334
Hey, loverboy.

674
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:48,368
Dede's looking foryou.

675
00:57:01,133 --> 00:57:03,368
- Looking for me?
-Johnny.

676
00:57:04,433 --> 00:57:07,702
- There might be a little problem.
- What is it?

677
00:57:07,766 --> 00:57:11,269
Carlin came around yesterday
kind of mad.

678
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:13,435
Tell me something new.

679
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:18,071
Johnny, you know the outtakes
for that footage?

680
00:57:18,133 --> 00:57:20,935
- You know, the draft-card burners?
- Yeah.

681
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,001
Did you give that
to the light show kids?

682
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:26,235
For Christ's sakes, don't be cute.
What the hell did he say?

683
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:28,669
He didn't say anything
definite really.

684
00:57:28,733 --> 00:57:32,103
Hejust complained about you
being out when he needed you...

685
00:57:32,166 --> 00:57:35,168
and screwing around,
shooting stupid interviews.

686
00:57:35,233 --> 00:57:39,070
What the hell is up?
Don't tell me whatyou think.

687
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:41,401
Just tell me what kind
ofshit's flying around.

688
00:57:41,466 --> 00:57:43,501
Jesus, let go.

689
00:57:47,633 --> 00:57:49,835
l'll tell you.

690
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,237
Well, for about a year now...

691
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:03,938
the station's been letting
the cops and the FBl...

692
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,335
study our footage.

693
00:58:08,033 --> 00:58:13,805
You're putting me on.
You're kidding me. What am l, a fink?

694
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:16,134
How can l go out
and cover a stoy?

695
00:58:16,199 --> 00:58:18,969
lt's a wonder more cameras
haven't been smashed.

696
00:58:19,033 --> 00:58:21,402
l want to know why nobody told me
what the hell's been going on...

697
00:58:21,466 --> 00:58:24,602
because you can bet
in the streets, they know.

698
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:26,934
You should've told me, Dede.

699
00:58:30,966 --> 00:58:33,034
-Just a sec, will you?
- Is he here? Where is he?

700
00:58:33,099 --> 00:58:35,202
l want to see him.

701
00:58:35,266 --> 00:58:38,969
He won't be in this morning.
This is foryou.

702
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:48,704
Where the hell is he?
Why won't he be in?

703
00:58:48,766 --> 00:58:51,001
What the hell is this crap?

704
00:59:15,566 --> 00:59:20,203
l don't know what day
it plays. Wha--

705
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:23,335
That was a business call.

706
00:59:25,166 --> 00:59:26,100
Accounting.

707
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:28,635
Did you get a severance notice
forJohn Katselas?

708
00:59:28,699 --> 00:59:31,002
Just a minute.

709
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,601
Yes, l have it here.
Who's calling?

710
00:59:38,566 --> 00:59:41,669
l'd tell them to
stufftheir lousyjob in a minute.

711
00:59:41,733 --> 00:59:44,202
Well, you know that. l would.

712
00:59:46,366 --> 00:59:48,267
l would.

713
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:51,803
As far as l'm concerned,
l'm with you,John.

714
00:59:51,866 --> 00:59:54,935
l'll tell the bastards,
''lfJohn goes, then l walk with him.''

715
00:59:59,966 --> 01:00:01,901
Well, l gotta get moving.

716
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:05,368
Take it easy, Gus.

717
01:00:27,933 --> 01:00:29,534
Remember me?

718
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:37,767
Yeah.

719
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,202
Yeah, l almost didn't
recognize you in that outfit.

720
01:00:40,266 --> 01:00:42,868
l work over there at Motorola.

721
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,001
Well...

722
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:50,268
it's been good seeing you.

723
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:55,635
How's the pigeon boy doing?

724
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:57,568
Real good.Just fine.

725
01:00:58,900 --> 01:01:02,370
- You always eat here?
- It's pretty bad, isn't it?

726
01:01:02,433 --> 01:01:04,368
Most times l bring my own.

727
01:01:08,666 --> 01:01:10,601
Where you headed?

728
01:01:15,633 --> 01:01:17,568
Did you finish your salad?

729
01:01:17,633 --> 01:01:19,568
You want some of mine?

730
01:01:19,633 --> 01:01:21,067
Sure?

731
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:27,168
What's the matter?

732
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:31,269
Maybe it'sjust that
he's not used to company, huh?

733
01:01:36,766 --> 01:01:38,701
What'd you do back home?

734
01:01:38,766 --> 01:01:41,001
l was a schoolteacher.

735
01:01:41,066 --> 01:01:43,535
You were?
Why aren't you teaching here?

736
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,535
Things are vey different up here.

737
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:49,837
Down home l taught five grades
in one room for one thing.

738
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,334
Wow .

739
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,435
Like the little red schoolhouse.

740
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:56,169
Kind of. But...

741
01:01:56,233 --> 01:02:00,370
see, they don't recognize me
as a teacher up here.

742
01:02:00,433 --> 01:02:04,370
The education that l had down home
isn't good enough for them...

743
01:02:04,433 --> 01:02:06,902
for me to teach here, so l can't.

744
01:02:06,966 --> 01:02:10,102
But l'll tell you,
l don't think l'd want to anyway.

745
01:02:10,166 --> 01:02:12,301
l wouldn't want to teach
in the schools in this neighborhood.

746
01:02:12,366 --> 01:02:15,469
- Why not?
- They don't teach you nothing.

747
01:02:15,533 --> 01:02:18,235
lt's a Chicago school.
They got to teach you something.

748
01:02:18,300 --> 01:02:23,304
They don't.
They run a television in there.

749
01:02:23,366 --> 01:02:25,301
Well, they use TV these days.

750
01:02:25,366 --> 01:02:27,301
They use educational--

751
01:02:27,366 --> 01:02:29,568
Yeah, but not that kind ofTV.

752
01:02:29,633 --> 01:02:33,803
You watch anything you want.
They don't ty--

753
01:02:33,866 --> 01:02:35,801
When you ask them to--

754
01:02:35,866 --> 01:02:37,801
that you want to do some work...

755
01:02:37,866 --> 01:02:40,668
they say,
''No, you do what l tell you.''

756
01:02:40,733 --> 01:02:43,235
- They let you watch TV, is that it?
- Yeah, that's all.

757
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:46,936
- They don't do nothing else.
- Don't you like TV?

758
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,935
Yeah, but--

759
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:51,068
You're probably doing
what you like.

760
01:02:51,133 --> 01:02:54,336
- Where you from?
- Right here. Chicago.

761
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,470
C.Y.O. welterweight boxer, 1 958.

762
01:02:59,666 --> 01:03:02,368
You ever boxed? Or do you
just wrestle when you fight?

763
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:05,435
People down here use sticks,
rocks...

764
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:08,402
guns, and eveything
down here in here.

765
01:03:08,466 --> 01:03:10,968
- Nah, you don't use rocks, do you?
- Yeah.

766
01:03:11,033 --> 01:03:12,968
l don't. They do.

767
01:03:13,033 --> 01:03:17,036
- Only dirty fighters use rocks.
- And guns and sticks.

768
01:03:17,099 --> 01:03:18,835
You got a gun?

769
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,735
Play gun?

770
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:23,502
That's good.

771
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:27,069
l shot a gun when l was eight--
l mean, ten years old.

772
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:31,303
- Where?
- West Virginia.

773
01:03:31,366 --> 01:03:34,102
l'll take him with me
to C.Y.O. maybe...

774
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:37,235
and let him hit the bag.

775
01:03:44,866 --> 01:03:46,500
Can l watch TV?

776
01:03:46,566 --> 01:03:50,202
Help me put the plates in the sink,
and then you can go watch TV.

777
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:55,434
l'll give you a hand here.

778
01:04:00,733 --> 01:04:02,668
ls your bird okay?

779
01:04:04,333 --> 01:04:07,035
The other day, l thought you were
stealing something off my car.

780
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:09,135
l don't steal!

781
01:04:09,199 --> 01:04:12,703
Anyway, what's so great
about your shitty car?

782
01:04:12,766 --> 01:04:15,068
l brought your bird back, didn't l?

783
01:04:17,666 --> 01:04:20,168
Anyway, it's not my car.

784
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,402
Beverly Hillbillies,
normally scheduled for this time...

785
01:04:31,466 --> 01:04:33,067
will not be seen tonight.

786
01:04:33,133 --> 01:04:35,735
lnstead, we bring you the third part
ofa network special...

787
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,469
on John F. Kennedy,
Martin Luther King...

788
01:04:38,533 --> 01:04:40,167
and Robert Kennedy.

789
01:04:59,666 --> 01:05:01,601
Why'd they fire you?

790
01:05:01,666 --> 01:05:03,768
Can you get anotherjob?

791
01:05:03,833 --> 01:05:07,236
Can you get welfare?
l mean, unemployment?

792
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:10,335
Do l look worried?

793
01:05:12,466 --> 01:05:16,369
Too many questions.
Why they canned me?

794
01:05:16,433 --> 01:05:18,668
l'm not sure l know the answer.

795
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,736
l started a stoy about a cabdriver
who found all that cash...

796
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:28,104
somebody lost and,
for unknown reasons, wouldn't claim.

797
01:05:28,166 --> 01:05:29,433
Why?

798
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:32,102
There's only one kind of money
a guy would be afraid to claim.

799
01:05:32,166 --> 01:05:34,234
l had some idea maybe
there was a connection...

800
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,235
between guns, vigilante groups...

801
01:05:36,300 --> 01:05:39,436
maybe getting ready
for a blowup this summer, you know?

802
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,503
Then l got sort ofsidetracked--
interested, so to speak.

803
01:05:43,566 --> 01:05:46,001
But nobody said anything about this.

804
01:05:46,066 --> 01:05:48,234
My directorjust told
my union local...

805
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:51,603
l had taken company film
without authorization.

806
01:05:51,666 --> 01:05:53,901
You see,
it gets pretty complicated.

807
01:05:53,966 --> 01:05:56,835
People rarely say
the real reasons for things.

808
01:05:56,900 --> 01:05:58,935
Big corporations never do.

809
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:01,935
Just politics...

810
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:05,603
plain bureaucratic politics.

811
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:08,301
l guess it's the season up here.

812
01:06:08,366 --> 01:06:11,202
Anyway, we only been
in Chicago a little while...

813
01:06:11,266 --> 01:06:13,601
not even long enough
for me to vote.

814
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:20,603
Come on. Tell me how you managed to
teach five grades in one classroom.

815
01:06:21,966 --> 01:06:25,436
l didn't manage.
One thing l did was--

816
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:28,035
Well, l just had three
in the third grade...

817
01:06:28,099 --> 01:06:30,302
so l put one boy up to fourth...

818
01:06:30,366 --> 01:06:32,468
and a boy and girl back to second.

819
01:06:32,533 --> 01:06:34,935
That way l only had four grades.

820
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,535
ls that the new math?

821
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,971
Gather with the saints at the river

822
01:07:11,033 --> 01:07:15,704
That _ows by the throne ofGod

823
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:21,704
Shall we gather at the river

824
01:07:21,766 --> 01:07:26,937
Where bright Angel's feet have trod

825
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:27,000
With these Christians at the river

827
01:07:31,866 --> 01:07:36,203
That _ows by the throne ofGod

828
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:42,504
Yes, we shall gather at the river

829
01:07:42,566 --> 01:07:47,938
The beautiful, beautiful river

830
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,604
Gather with the saints at the river

831
01:07:52,666 --> 01:07:57,337
That _ows by the throne ofGod

832
01:07:58,366 --> 01:08:03,571
Yes, we shall gather at the river

833
01:08:03,633 --> 01:08:09,105
The beautiful, beautiful river

834
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:13,637
Gather with the saints at the river

835
01:08:13,699 --> 01:08:19,105
That _ows by the throne ofGod

836
01:08:19,933 --> 01:08:23,036
Well, l don't know
what will happen now.

837
01:08:23,100 --> 01:08:25,802
We've got some dimicult
days ahead...

838
01:08:27,066 --> 01:08:29,535
but it doesn't really matter
with me now...

839
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:31,835
because l've been
to the mou nta i ntop.

840
01:08:33,666 --> 01:08:35,601
l don't mind.

841
01:08:38,600 --> 01:08:43,271
Like anybody,
l would like to live a long life.

842
01:08:43,333 --> 01:08:47,103
Longevity has its place...

843
01:08:47,166 --> 01:08:50,502
but l'm not concerned
about that now.

844
01:08:50,566 --> 01:08:52,901
l just want to do God's will.

845
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,869
And He's allowed me
to go up to the mountain.

846
01:08:56,933 --> 01:09:00,036
-Jesus, l love to shoot film.
- And l've looked over...

847
01:09:00,933 --> 01:09:03,235
and l've seen...

848
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:05,669
the promised land.

849
01:09:05,733 --> 01:09:08,335
l may not get there with you...

850
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,136
but l want you to know tonight...

851
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:13,135
that we, as a people...

852
01:09:13,199 --> 01:09:15,702
will get to the promised land.

853
01:09:18,699 --> 01:09:20,635
Do you feel it?

854
01:09:20,699 --> 01:09:22,635
X rays, is that what it is?
Does it grow hair?

855
01:09:22,699 --> 01:09:24,868
ls it vitamins?

856
01:09:24,933 --> 01:09:27,135
Can you feel violence?

857
01:09:27,199 --> 01:09:29,435
l don't know what to think.

858
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:33,237
lt seems like no man's life
is worth anything anymore.

859
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:38,335
You see...

860
01:09:38,399 --> 01:09:40,335
the media's got a script now...

861
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:42,268
by the numbers.

862
01:09:42,333 --> 01:09:45,469
Flags at half-mast.
Trips canceled.

863
01:09:45,533 --> 01:09:47,601
Ball games called off.
Schools closed.

864
01:09:47,666 --> 01:09:49,634
Flags at half-mast.

865
01:09:50,699 --> 01:09:53,102
Memorial meetings.
Memorial marches.

866
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:55,167
Moments ofsilence.

867
01:09:56,366 --> 01:09:58,668
A widow cries,
and then she says brave words.

868
01:09:58,733 --> 01:10:00,668
- More moments ofsilence...
- Standing by...

869
01:10:00,733 --> 01:10:03,502
- in our Washington studio is...
- then the funeral procession.

870
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,702
a foremost expert on urban violence
on the contemporay scene.

871
01:10:06,766 --> 01:10:09,335
A lot ofexperts...

872
01:10:09,399 --> 01:10:12,970
saying how sick our society is,
how sick we all are.

873
01:10:14,833 --> 01:10:17,368
The script is a national drain-off.

874
01:10:18,933 --> 01:10:23,037
People say, ''Yeah, yeah,
we're guilty. We're bad.''

875
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:25,535
'Cause a lot of people are afraid.
They're afraid...

876
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,869
the Negroes are going to tear up
their stores, burn neighborhoods...

877
01:10:28,933 --> 01:10:31,168
so they have this nationwide...

878
01:10:31,233 --> 01:10:35,303
coast-to-coast network special
called ''Mourn the Martyr.''

879
01:10:35,366 --> 01:10:37,701
Nobody's really
on the hook, you see?

880
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:41,102
Traditionally, religion
has supplied the moral backstop.

881
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:45,236
When the script is finished
and Tuesday comes around...

882
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,236
or Saturday and...

883
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,835
National Drain-OffWeek is over...

884
01:10:52,566 --> 01:10:55,101
eveybody goes pretty much
back to normal.

885
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:58,234
Normal this, normal that.

886
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:01,102
You know, normal.

887
01:11:01,166 --> 01:11:04,302
We will be able
to speed up that day...

888
01:11:04,366 --> 01:11:06,501
when all of God's children--

889
01:11:06,566 --> 01:11:08,634
black men and white men...

890
01:11:08,699 --> 01:11:10,635
)ews and gentiles...

891
01:11:10,699 --> 01:11:12,635
Protestants and Catholics--

892
01:11:12,699 --> 01:11:14,835
will be able to join hands...

893
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:18,436
and sing in the words
ofthe old Negro spiritual--

894
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:21,469
free at last? free at last?

895
01:11:21,533 --> 01:11:25,003
Thank God Almighty,
we a re free at last?

896
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:30,035
Goose bumps.

897
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,036
lt reminds me
ofchurch down home...

898
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:36,402
sitting there with Clovis...

899
01:11:36,466 --> 01:11:39,502
and Grandma and Buddy.

900
01:11:39,566 --> 01:11:43,336

904

lt'd be too corny,
like the #_te5how.

905
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:03,434
Buddy's dead.

906
01:12:03,500 --> 01:12:06,970
U nited Airlines says,
''Come _y with me.''

915

- Well, thanks.

916
01:12:32,933 --> 01:12:35,969
lt's 1 1:30 on WHJP.

917
01:12:37,033 --> 01:12:39,802
Harold must have me on his list.

918
01:12:39,866 --> 01:12:42,902
No, you're wrong.

919
01:12:42,966 --> 01:12:45,902
Once he speaks his mind,
he's clear.

920
01:12:51,800 --> 01:12:54,669
Tonight Channel 8 proudly
presents Brigitte Bardot...

01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,402
there's a lot of things that you
don't understand about womenfolks...

930
01:14:38,466 --> 01:14:41,302
l want to talk to you about it,
ya hear?

931
01:14:42,833 --> 01:14:46,703
A man has got to be boss
ofhis home.

932
01:14:46,766 --> 01:14:49,869
There ain't no two bosses in
the family because it ain't right.

933
01:14:49,933 --> 01:14:51,868
- You understand that?
- Yeah.

934
01:14:51,933 --> 01:14:54,969
The thing l'm tying to show you is
that women don't understand a man.

935
01:14:55,033 --> 01:14:56,901
Your home is your castle.

936
01:14:56,966 --> 01:15:00,669
l don't care how bad
or where you live or what it is.

937
01:15:00,733 --> 01:15:05,838
That's your castle, and that woman
was made foryou and belongs to you.

938
01:15:05,899 --> 01:15:07,835
You don't belong to her,
but she belongs to you.

939
01:15:07,899 --> 01:15:11,937
You twain become one flesh,
and that flesh is you.

940
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:14,268
She belongs to you, you understand?

941
01:15:16,166 --> 01:15:20,103
There's a lot of good womenfolks
in the world, don't get me wrong.

942
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:23,202
l mean, the majority of them,
they get high ideas...

943
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:26,067
like they want to go out
on their own.

944
01:15:26,133 --> 01:15:28,535
They want to take over things.

945
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:31,202
- That's right. Yeah.
- Is that what you mean?

946
01:15:31,266 --> 01:15:31,266
But don't you never let them, son.

948
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,701
Come here.

949
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:19,435
- Wow! Somebody made this.
- You see it?

950
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:21,635
Yeah, l made it. Look at this.

951
01:17:21,699 --> 01:17:24,002
Wow!

952
01:17:24,066 --> 01:17:26,535
That's a shower. You take
your clothes offover here...

953
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:28,535
then you jump in there.

954
01:18:00,966 --> 01:18:02,934
What'd your daddy do
in West Virginia?

955
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:05,869
Coal miner.

956
01:18:05,933 --> 01:18:08,035
Why isn't he coal mining now?

957
01:18:10,533 --> 01:18:13,135
Coal mine shut down, l reckon.

958
01:18:13,199 --> 01:18:15,268
We moved to Chicago.

959
01:18:15,333 --> 01:18:18,636
He left
and we ain't seen' him since.

960
01:18:19,699 --> 01:18:23,136
Just took off. l don't know.

961
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,135
We'll be good friends, okay?

962
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:17,567
Bye.

963
01:19:19,166 --> 01:19:21,735
Hey, champ. How you doing?

964
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:29,770
You see, the object of this one...

965
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,735
is speed and power...

966
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,234
SO...

967
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:38,468
you work on both.

968
01:19:44,833 --> 01:19:46,434
You see...

969
01:19:48,600 --> 01:19:50,601
really, the object is...

970
01:19:50,666 --> 01:19:54,703
to knock the other guy's
brains out, and then you win.

971
01:19:55,833 --> 01:19:58,535
Roll n u m ber th ree, n u m ber th ree.
Sound roll number three.

972
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:02,370
National Democratic Convention,
August 1 968.

973
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:06,068
Hey, how goes my boy,
Johnny the Greek?

974
01:20:06,133 --> 01:20:08,368
- All right. Good.
- Good, good.

975
01:20:08,433 --> 01:20:11,435
You look like you're doing
all right these days.

976
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,635
l sawyou in the film
with Norman Mailer.

977
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:18,637
- What kind ofa guy is he?
- He's out ofsight.

978
01:20:18,699 --> 01:20:21,402
l mean, Mailer is wild.
He's crazy.

979
01:20:21,466 --> 01:20:25,603
But the thing about Mailer is that
he cuts through the bullshit.

980
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:28,935
l mean, Mailer is a force.
He's a hea_weight.

981
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,602
Excuse me. May l make up
your room, please?

982
01:20:32,699 --> 01:20:34,468
Sure.

983
01:20:38,666 --> 01:20:40,768
Listen, you don't have
to start until Thursday.

984
01:20:40,833 --> 01:20:44,136

Excuse me.

987
01:20:48,566 --> 01:20:50,501
and then l won't
disturb you anymore.

988
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:02,201
You seem kind ofdown,John.

989
01:21:03,266 --> 01:21:05,735
Sometimes up, sometimes down.

990
01:21:07,033 --> 01:21:10,236
Nah, l'm okay.
l'm just anxious to get working.

991
01:21:10,300 --> 01:21:13,670
The photography is not the problem
with thisjob, baby.

992
01:21:13,733 --> 01:21:16,268
Thisjob is keeping up
without being crushed...

993
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:18,868
or having your clothes torn off.

994
01:21:18,933 --> 01:21:21,335
You'll see the day
after tomorrow.

995
01:21:22,899 --> 01:21:24,901
You still see the nurse?

996
01:21:24,966 --> 01:21:27,868
No, not for some time now.

997

l can still smell it.

1010
01:22:29,100 --> 01:22:31,035
That's the stockyards.

lt was a cap or something.''
l said, ''No.''

Some cop says, ''What'd you throw?
What are you doing here?''

1186
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:09,102
He said, ''l'm from El Paso, Texas.''
Then he pushed him into the crowd.

1187
01:47:09,166 --> 01:47:10,767
They're tying to
keep them contained...

People were standing around cying.

1204

01:50:00,800 --> 01:50:03,869
by showing my press badge
to a kindly policeman.

1245
01:50:03,933 --> 01:50:07,002
People are being smashed up
against the wall...

1246
01:50:07,066 --> 01:50:08,700
and are being hit...

1247
01:50:08,766 --> 01:50:11,034
by the police with their clubs.

1248
01:50:11,100 --> 01:50:13,268
And those are real night sticks...

1249
01:50:13,333 --> 01:50:15,468
and people are really being hit.
