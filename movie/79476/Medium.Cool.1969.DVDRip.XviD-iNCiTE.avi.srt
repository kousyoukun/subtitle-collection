{2146}{2197}Better call an ambulance.
{2454}{2541}- 5251, Chicago.|- 5251.
{2543}{2590}Better send an ambulance|out to the Eisenhower...
{2592}{2638}in front of|the MacKenzie turnoff.
{2639}{2740}Got a wreck. We got coverage.|We'll send it in with the bike man.
{2742}{2805}- Ten-four.|- Okay.
{2834}{2882}5251, clear.
{6034}{6129}Now, that's his public posture,|but he's the one who's right there...
{6130}{6227}with his eyes glued to the screen|when the blood starts running--
{6229}{6305}And he's the one who says,|"Ooh, isn't it horrible?.
{6307}{6366}Isn't it horrible?.|Let me see some more."
{6367}{6417}There are a lot of people|who buy The New York Times.
{6418}{6494}What I mean to say|is that it happens--
{6496}{6594}It has happened always,|whether it was a photographer...
{6596}{6663}or a journalist or a cameraman.
{6665}{6746}When you are in the middle|of something happening, you--
{6747}{6801}It is a risk|of the profession.
{6802}{6901}What's the difference between a person|who types something and a typewriter?.
{6903}{6974}The typewriter doesn't really care|about what's being typed.
{6998}{7077}But a typewriter's a machine,|and you're not a machine.
{7122}{7199}Actually, I'm kind of an elongation|of a tape recorder.
{7240}{7311}I've made films on all kinds|of social problems.
{7313}{7377}The big bombs were the ones|where we went into detail...
{7378}{7431}and showed|why something happened.
{7433}{7511}Nobody wants to take the time. They'd|rather see 30 seconds of somebody...
{7513}{7602}getting their skull cracked, turn off|the TV and say, "Let me have a beer."
{7604}{7659}But Hollywood, the news med--
{7661}{7759}Well, our position|is one to-- to record.
{7761}{7806}The dynamics that are|happening in society--
{7808}{7863}We don't deal|with the static things.
{7865}{7945}We deal with the violence.|We deal with--
{7946}{8026}Who wants to see somebody sitting,|to see somebody lying down...
{8028}{8101}somebody talking peace,|unless they're talking loud?.
{8103}{8162}The cameraman|makes the choice himself.
{8164}{8224}He's out|to get the blood and guts.
{8226}{8274}I believe that.|The other night on television...
{8276}{8327}there was a fellow in Gary--|in the ghetto.
{8329}{8399}If there's something else that maybe|is nice, that could fill the news...
{8401}{8497}he'll take the stabbing, even if|he's had 27 minutes of stabbing before.
{8498}{8570}They're someplace safe,|away from it. They deplore it...
{8571}{8627}but they deplore it|like all good people.
{8629}{8722}All good people deplore problems|at a distance, like Thomas Jefferson.
{8723}{8777}He loved the common man,|but at a distance.
{8779}{8819}This is exactly what happened.
{8821}{8892}Five cameramen have been killed,|one in Germany.
{8894}{9005}He was beat to death by a mob,|literally beat to death-- for UPI.
{9006}{9104}Know the excuse?. The crowd thought|he was taking pictures for the police.
{9106}{9181}They had a couple of fellas|in a civil rights protest...
{9182}{9257}that were chained together,|and I was taking pictures.
{9259}{9302}Cops said, "Don't you think|you'd better load the camera?'
{9304}{9365}I says, "I'm not out of film."|They said, "Load it anyway.
{9366}{9431}We wanna move these guys."|And he starts pushing the lens.
{9433}{9490}I says, "The next time you push me,|I'll fall down and start crying."
{9491}{9530}He walked away.
{9532}{9611}The 1 20 Angineaux lens,|and yanking back and forth...
{9613}{9709}yelling "Black Power" at me,|and I'm just shaking to death...
{9710}{9771}with a $1,200 lens on the camera.
{9773}{9845}I am in the middle.|I got no place to hide.
{9846}{9955}I'm carrying a 40-pound camera,|trying to get pictures of it.
{9957}{10058}The rioterwants to beat me up, thinks|I'm trying to identify him for police.
{10060}{10130}The policeman wants to elbow me|out of the way...
{10131}{10201}and I'm being gentle about it because|he doesn't want the sergeant to see...
{10202}{10300}he picked up some guy by his neck|and threw him in the backseat of a car.
{10302}{10365}Then the editor says,|"I want the pictures.
{10366}{10438}My audience doesn't care|what brought this on."
{10440}{10508}You have to feed your family.|You need the money.
{10510}{10556}Ifyou don't bring them back,|you're not going to have a job.
{10558}{10664}Forget that. I've got a job to do,|and I'm interested in it.
{10666}{10794}The point I resent very much is the fact|that wherever I go, I'm beat up.
{10834}{10896}Shoot into those troops!.|Shoot 'em!
{10898}{10962}Shoot the shit out of'em!|Get 'em!
{10964}{11005}You guys are shot!
{11006}{11070}What kind of country is this?.|What's wrong?.
{11072}{11147}We're people! Why do you|have soldiers here with bayonets?.
{11216}{11278}We got a captive. Hold on.
{11494}{11620}That was an unprovoked attack|that was retaliatory--
{11622}{11657}Not me. Not me.
{11659}{11722}This man has an obsolete weapon.
{11724}{11773}Make love, not war.
{11803}{11878}They stabbed one of our guys|in the belly.
{11880}{11961}I am Brigadier General|Richard T. Dunn...
{11962}{12046}commanding general of the|emergency operation headquarters...
{12048}{12115}of the Illinois Army|National Guard.
{12130}{12174}The emergency operation|headquarters...
{12176}{12262}is one which|was established last winter...
{12264}{12352}for the purpose ofplanning|and controlling operations...
{12354}{12410}in the event|of civil disturbances.
{12435}{12475}Over.
{12477}{12539}Out in the street,|their bayonets are fixed...
{12541}{12649}and they know it's for real|in a real riot in the city.
{12650}{12708}And here we know|it's more or less--
{12710}{12756}It's a war game, more or less.
{12758}{12790}How's it going so far?
{12791}{12846}I couldn't tellyou.|I'm the enemy.
{12848}{12903}We love you guys.
{12941}{13007}We have women foryou, beer.
{13009}{13065}Come on!
{13066}{13161}- Sing it, now.|- Glory, glory, hallelujah
{13350}{13454}His truth is marching on
{13456}{13517}- When do we want freedom?|- Now!
{13519}{13586}- When do we want equality?|- Now!
{13587}{13646}- When are we gonna get it?|- Now!
{13647}{13733}It is what our forefathers fought for--|the free choice ofpeople!
{13734}{13765}Y eah!
{13790}{13838}This country is changing.
{13840}{13889}It is no longer|for all the people.
{13890}{13974}- It is for some ofthe people.|- Y eah!
{13976}{14052}- We see a war we do not want.|- Y eah!
{14054}{14121}We see an apathy towards|love and brotherhood.
{14122}{14149}Y eah!
{14151}{14224}- Bring out the mayor.|- We want the mayor!
{14258}{14337}- Hold on.|- We want the mayor!
{14338}{14403}We want the mayor!
{14520}{14586}We'll bring thejudge|out to talk to you.
{14588}{14668}We want the mayor!|We don't want a flunky!
{14670}{14720}We want the mayor!
{14770}{14842}My friends,|I've stood before you many times.
{14843}{14892}Tell it to 'em, Mayor!
{14910}{15009}You elected me mayor ofthis town|for the last 20 years.
{15010}{15058}- No, we didn 't!|- Tell it to 'em!
{15096}{15187}We've given you everything|that we thought you needed.
{15245}{15345}I've let you use our swimming pool|every 4th ofJuly.
{15346}{15404}We want it every day ofthe year!
{15430}{15467}We've operated--
{15469}{15564}We've operated the liquor store|with a minimum ofprofit.
{15566}{15628}Sock it to 'em, baby!|Sock it to 'em.
{15630}{15740}I understand that|you have some problems.
{15801}{15895}- You have avoided our problems!|- I understand that you have--
{15934}{16009}I understand that|you have some complaints.
{16035}{16135}We shall overcome.|We shall overcome.
{16137}{16239}We shall overcome
{16451}{16567}Some day
{17154}{17187}Yeah
{17262}{17312}Get the guys with the cameras.
{17556}{17642}Four, three, two, one.
{17644}{17731}Fade in.|Richard starts back.
{17768}{17840}And cue announce.|And keep on coming.
{17864}{17938}- And hold.|- What's wrong?
{17940}{18020}Now.|Down and in slowly.
{18021}{18060}Very slowly.

{18229}{18292}Slate on one.|Stand by to take.
{18336}{18397}Roll tape to record.|In, Arnold.
{18462}{18538}- Stand by.|- Four, three...
{18540}{18584}two, one.
{18586}{18628}Fade in.
{18813}{18872}You want to move|over here, please?.
{18873}{18935}Let's go. Time is money.|Let's go.
{18936}{19010}Gus, is the El too loud for you?.
{19012}{19059}No, we can live with it.
{19124}{19178}Who here|is old enough to vote?.
{19180}{19240}I took my physical last week.
{19242}{19288}Physical to vote?.
{19314}{19404}- Why are you working for Kennedy?.|- He's the best.
{19406}{19467}- He's got long hair.|- He's against the war.
{19468}{19524}- What are you doing here?.|- She's my friend.
{19526}{19617}He's an idealist. He's for anyone|who hasn't got a chance.
{19619}{19710}- Who are you for?.|- I don't like him because of Oswald...
{19712}{19762}and Dallas and all that.
{19764}{19826}What does that have|to do with it?.
{19828}{19883}I think he should have|looked into it.
{19884}{19941}There's a lot of serious questions|that haven't been answered.
{19943}{20002}In the Saturday Evening Post|there was a statement...
{20004}{20075}that the CIA knew about|Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico...
{20077}{20141}only two months|before John Kennedy--
{21772}{21823}May I help you?
{22109}{22192}Damn it. It looks|like I'm a prime target.
{22237}{22304}First the hubcaps,|now my radio antenna.
{22532}{22575}Rotten kids.
{22576}{22659}What's the difference?. Channel Eight's|got more where these came from.
{22660}{22712}That's not the point.
{22714}{22748}What?.
{22792}{22870}- Where do you want to go?.|- How about a movie?.
{25045}{25097}Come on. Go after her!
{25099}{25136}Attagirl!
{25166}{25239}In the crotch! Atta baby!|In the crotch!

{25464}{25522}- Kill her!|- Pull her hair!
{25581}{25646}- Tie her up!|- Kick her in the back!
{25648}{25690}Kick her in the back!
{25692}{25724}Yea!

{26068}{26116}Go to work. Go to work.
{26208}{26244}Go! Go! Go!
{26958}{27018}- No cheating.|- Goes foryou too.
{27020}{27084}That's right.
{27086}{27125}All right.|Deuces are wild, Robert.
{27179}{27214}Whoops.
{27328}{27375}All right.|Show him what to do.
{27505}{27558}Now, deuces are wild, Robert.
{27560}{27628}They count as anything|you want 'em to.
{27629}{27686}Hold 'em. Hold 'em.
{27688}{27760}Take this one.|Throw the rest away.
{27762}{27804}- This?.|- How many you want?.

{27893}{27948}- How many you want?.|- Five.
{27949}{27992}You mean four.
{28029}{28073}No cheating, now.
{28204}{28278}- Two aces. What do you got?.|- I got two treys.
{28280}{28321}Two treys.
{28368}{28436}- What'd you do?. You throw--|- I got two aces.
{28438}{28499}You throwed down|my three nines down, didn't you?.
{28500}{28541}No, he got 'em.
{28543}{28591}I didn't get 'em.|They're in the deck.
{28627}{28694}He threw 'em down.
{28696}{28750}Boy, it's hot.|You got anything to drink?.
{28863}{28917}Miss Horton,|you have anything to drink?.
{28918}{28984}- There's plenty ofwater in the sink.|- I don't want any water.
{28986}{29070}I want a Coke or something.|Let's go get a Coke, Robert.
{29154}{29201}We'll see you there.
{29438}{29510}- Where'd your friends go?.|- To get a Coke.

{29702}{29760}- Who won?.|- Nobody.
{29762}{29804}Nobody.
{29806}{29865}- What's the matter?.|- Nothing.
{29891}{29953}You're pretty dirty.|You've been working them birds.
{29955}{30029}You'd better go wash up|before we eat supper.
{30100}{30144}Well, go on.
{30179}{30224}Go on, now. Get.
{31294}{31342}We thank Thee, Lord,|for this food.
{31344}{31426}Bless it to the nourishment|of our bodies. In Thy name we pray.
{31428}{31459}Amen.
{32246}{32308}"The racing pigeon,|or homing pigeon...
{32310}{32417}remains faithful to its mate|throughout its life...
{32419}{32533}provided that the mate|is present at all times...
{32534}{32629}especially when|the male bird returns...
{32630}{32682}after a long flight.
{32684}{32762}In addition,|when the pair has young...
{32763}{32832}this bond is even stronger.
{32834}{32924}If, however,|the family is separated...
{32926}{32975}for an extended period...
{32977}{33093}the male pigeon,|not unlike his human counterpart...

{33558}{33621}This may be the last time
{33754}{33805}May be the last time|but I don 't know
{33806}{33874}Well, it may be the last time|you march on the capitol
{33941}{34002}Well, it may be the last time|you march on Congress
{34046}{34129}Well, it may be the last time|you march foryour freedom
{34191}{34245}Thinking, this may be the last time
{34246}{34297}Appalachia.|You see the si gn?.
{34298}{34352}- Could we get a drink of water first?.|- T o hell with the water.
{34354}{34405}Let's find this guy.
{34439}{34506}They're behind the Mexicans,|ain't they?.
{34508}{34593}I heard they were behind|the San Francisco contingent.
{34595}{34679}- This is in this direction here.|- I thought it was a blue tent.
{34681}{34732}I don't know how these people|listen to this crap.

{34808}{34878}- Well, where is it?.|- Let's go this way.
{35398}{35483}I would hope, now that|the California primary is finished...
{35485}{35530}now that these primaries are over...
{35531}{35599}that we could now concentrate|on having a dialogue...
{35601}{35694}or a debate, I hope,|between the vice president and myself...
{35696}{35735}of what direction|we want to go in.
{35922}{35973}Mayor Yorty hasjust|sent me a message...
{35975}{36030}that we've been here|too long already.
{36084}{36136}- We love you, Bob.|- My thanks to all ofyou...
{36138}{36197}and now it's on to Chicago,|and let's win there.
{36321}{36365}We want Bobby!
{36520}{36603}Oh, no|I don 't believe it
{36605}{36710}You say that you think|you know the meaning oflove
{36792}{36871}You say love is all we need
{36873}{36937}You say with your love
{36938}{37041}You could change all ofthe fools|all ofthe hate
{37042}{37125}I thinkyou're probably|out to lunch
{37334}{37397}You guys here|to cover the funeral?.
{37399}{37450}Yeah, that's what we're here for.
{37452}{37537}I didn't hear you|come in last night.
{37561}{37602}You score?.
{37677}{37731}You left the TV set on.
{37809}{37899}You know, you can meet a lot of|interesting people in a cocktail lounge.
{37937}{38022}You know that for every man in D.C.,|there are four and a halfwomen?.
{38169}{38260}It's a beautiful city, huh?.|Wow. Beautiful.
{38302}{38359}Boy, this air-conditioning|really gets you.
{38508}{38556}Look at these guys.
{38610}{38673}Couple of hours,|they're all set up.
{38766}{38846}Twenty, twenty-five camera positions--|like nothing.
{38966}{39032}They've had experience|since we did J.F.K. in '63.
{39615}{39658}Hello, ladies.
{39946}{39993}What are your plans|for the summer--
{39994}{40061}this, which will be|a very political summer...
{40062}{40101}and possibly a very hot one.
{40103}{40156}Oh, well, now,|let's not get into politics.
{40184}{40287}Well, we always go up|to our place...
{40289}{40401}up in Ontario, up in Canada.
{40402}{40455}It's a place called Desbras.
{40457}{40516}That's D-E-S. It's French.
{40518}{40563}It's not like a girl's name.
{40565}{40643}And, well, about this time ofyear,|we always start looking forward...
{40645}{40766}to getting away from the city|and the crowds and the heat.
{40768}{40839}It's very primitive up there.
{40841}{40939}And I think sometimes|it's good for the soul...
{40941}{41033}to get away from civilization,|don't you think so?.
{41591}{41641}- Hello.|- Hello.
{41643}{41731}- Is your mother home?.|- Yes. No.

{42155}{42215}- Yes.|- Where?.
{42217}{42322}- West Virginia.|- I see.

{42809}{42857}- Thirteen.|- Thirteen. Really?.
{42858}{42921}- And do you go to church?.|- Yes.
{42923}{42960}That's a good boy.
{42962}{43056}- Now, what is your father's name?.|- Buddy.
{43058}{43120}- What?.|- Buddy.
{43122}{43181}- Does he live here at home with you?.|- No.
{43182}{43248}Could you tell me|where I could find him?.

{48639}{48734}- We didn't see Mondo Cane.|- Well, I saw it.
{48735}{48793}I saw it, too, but I don't|remember seeing it with you.
{48845}{48909}Well, anyway,|that's not the point.
{48911}{48961}What's the point?.
{48987}{49049}Well, you remember that scene...
{49051}{49116}on an island,|where they tested an atom bomb?.
{49118}{49158}Yeah.
{49160}{49242}Well, there were|these big turtles...
{49243}{49333}you know, tortoises, who,|at a certain time in their lives...
{49335}{49431}would walk to the sea|to lay their eggs.
{49433}{49492}And they found that|the radiation thing...
{49494}{49545}threw the turtles'|sense of direction...
{49547}{49638}so instead of heading to the sea,|they went inland and died.
{49640}{49698}Oh, I'm crying.
{49760}{49808}Damn it!
{49810}{49876}Look, somebody|took those movies, right?.
{49878}{49953}I mean, do you think|did they or didn't they...
{49955}{50041}after they took those movies--
{50042}{50128}Do you think-- Did they reach down|and turn those turtles around...
{50152}{50216}or did they put them in a jeep|and drive them back?.
{50218}{50302}How the hell do I know what they did?.|Those were Italian cameramen.
{50394}{50459}I give up. I surrender.
{50598}{50643}No calories.
{50682}{50737}I'd rather|keep my kidneys for a while.
{50971}{51063}"Research physicians at the Istituto|del Salvador Muni in Rome...
{51065}{51115}reveal today the results of tests...
{51117}{51176}involving a new device to be worn|by expectant mothers...
{51178}{51238}during the entire course|of their pregnancy.
{51240}{51317}This device consists|of a steel and plastic cylinder...
{51318}{51390}which can be controlled|to create a partial vacuum...
{51392}{51501}around the mother's abdomen, reducing|atmospheric pressure on the fetus.
{51526}{51569}This pressure--
{51623}{51710}which is at sea level|1 4.7 pounds per square inch--
{51712}{51779}can be reduced by as much as 50%.
{51781}{51830}It was Dr. Giacobo Marciani...
{51832}{51881}director of|the hospital's research institute...
{51883}{51959}who first made public the results|of the test involving the new device.
{51978}{52057}Although it is anticipated|that the price...
{52059}{52105}in the early stages|of development, at least...
{52106}{52217}will be prohibited--|prohibiti-- prohibitive--
{52218}{52263}official comment|on the new device...
{52265}{52326}has not yet been forthcoming|from the Vatican."

{70368}{70446}You know, Chicago cops...
{70448}{70509}are getting|funnier-looking every day.
{70586}{70663}- I'm not a cop. I'm a soundman.|- Bet you got credentials too.
{70665}{70746}The FBI supplies|the best credentials.
{70775}{70834}We know|that one of the best ways...
{70835}{70921}for spying on black people|is to impersonate TV men.
{70923}{70975}We're talking to Frank|about doing a story.
{70977}{71041}- Yeah?. What's that?.|- That's my Pageboy.
{71077}{71150}- Your Pageboy?.|- Yeah.

{71394}{71436}Well, I don't do anything.|It just hangs there.
{71438}{71533}If they want me to go someplace|or do something, they call me on it.
{71535}{71655}You mean,|they give you orders on this.
{71657}{71703}Yeah.
{71774}{71875}Man, you mean to tell me they talk|to you, and you can't talk back?.

{73328}{73371}I haven't got time|right now, dear. I gotta run.
{73373}{73445}But I wanted to talk to you.|See, I'm a black actress.
{73447}{73521}- Listen, honey-- I haven't got time--|- Don't "honey" me.
{73523}{73623}I'm a black actress.|I demand respect. I'm not looking for--
{73625}{73727}- You call the station.|- No. You said you wanted somebody.
{73729}{73802}You want to hear-- know what's|going on, what black people are doing?.
{73804}{73866}- I'm not interested.|- Wait, wait.
{73868}{73966}- Don't "honey" me.|- You got to start respecting our women.
{73968}{74065}I have no disrespect in mind.|I gotta leave. I don't have time.
{74067}{74129}I want to talk to you|about what I'd like to do.
{74131}{74239}You people are always busy|putting your kind of people on.
{74241}{74295}I want to talk to you|about what I want.
{74297}{74367}- Listen, dear.|- I told you about that "dear."
{74369}{74453}- I'm trying to be very respectful.|- We demand--
{74455}{74522}- You demand what?.|- Demand respect.
{74595}{74634}- Handle it.|- I'll try.
{74636}{74735}- Don't call me "honey."|- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
{74737}{74829}-This is the guy that came by the house.|-I know the guy.
{74831}{74907}So don't give him a bad time.
{74909}{74947}Leave him alone.|He's all right.
{74949}{75006}- Come on, baby.|- He's a jive--
{75008}{75121}Wait a minute.|I want to talk to you. Come in.
{75123}{75186}Let me askyou something.|Are you being friendly?.
{75187}{75278}Am I being friendly?.|I just saved your life.
{75280}{75346}- If I got to be afraid--|- You understand I just saved your life?.
{75347}{75451}If I got to be afraid foryour argument|to work, you got no argument.
{75453}{75529}I want you to understand|I saved your life.
{75531}{75634}You came down here to do some sort|of jive interview.
{75635}{75758}You did that. Came down here with|1 5 minutes of a black sensibility...
{75760}{75811}and so you don't understand that.
{75813}{75854}You came down here|to shoot 1 5 minutes...
{75856}{75926}ofwhat has taken 300 years|to develop.
{75927}{75980}- Grief, you know?.|- I'm not interested in grief--
{75982}{76082}All we're trying to explain to you|is that you don't understand.
{76084}{76148}I do something.|I do it well. That's my job.
{76150}{76261}You don't do it black enough. You can't,|because you're not black. We are.
{76263}{76358}When you come and say you've come|to do something of human interest...
{76360}{76442}it makes a person wonder whether|you're going to do something...
{76443}{76544}of interest to other humans, or whether|you consider the person human...
{76546}{76590}in whom you're interested.
{76591}{76664}You have|to understand that too.
{76666}{76755}You can't just walk in|out ofyour arrogance...
{76757}{76817}and expect things|to be like they are...
{76819}{76881}because when you walked in,|you brought La Salle Street with you...
{76883}{76992}City Hall and all|the mass communications media.
{76994}{77084}And you are the exploiters.|You're the ones who distort...
{77086}{77218}and ridicule and emasculate us,|and that ain't cool.
{77220}{77298}You don't want to know, man.|You don't know the people.
{77300}{77354}You don't show the people.
{77355}{77419}Here's some cat|who's down and out, you dig?.
{77421}{77480}He's nobody,|so he says to his old man...
{77482}{77568}"I'm nobody. I'm gonna die,
{77570}{77629}and ain't nobody|gonna know I lived," dig?.
{77631}{77729}So the cat finds a brick and|throws it through Charlie's window...
{77731}{77808}or he takes a gun|and he shoots.
{77810}{77889}Then the cat lives, man.|He really lives, dig?.
{77891}{77959}A hundred million people|see the cat on the tube.
{77961}{78025}They say,|"The former invisible man lives."
{78027}{78131}Everybody knows about his wife|and kids-- everything, you dig?.
{78133}{78247}'Cause the tube is life, man. Life.
{78249}{78355}You make him an Emmy, man.|You make him the TV star of the hour...
{78356}{78451}on the 6:00, the 1 0:00|and the 1 2:00 news.
{78452}{78507}'Cause what the cat is saying|is truth, man.
{78509}{78596}Why don't you find out|what really is?.
{78598}{78647}Why you always got to wait|till somebody gets killed?.
{78649}{78692}'Cause somebody is gonna get killed.
{79209}{79257}Is that thing loaded?.
{79259}{79295}As a matter of fact,|they call it a shotgun.
{79297}{79345}It looks about 1 2-gauge.
{79401}{79452}- Let's go over here.|- Okay.
{79480}{79570}There's a good background.|Very good.
{79571}{79626}- We can't shoot here.|- What do you mean?.
{79627}{79682}Too noisy.|Those gunshots will wipe us out.
{79684}{79789}It's always too noisy, isn't it?.|Let's go back over here.
{79791}{79856}- Good for you?.|- Yeah, fine.
{79882}{79944}- Pepsi machine. Good enough?.|- Fine.
{79946}{79991}Excuse me.
{79993}{80075}- What do I do now?.|- Just speak in a normal tone ofvoice.
{80077}{80132}Rolling here. Rolling.
{80134}{80208}Well, there's been|about a 46% increase...
{80210}{80271}in pistol registration|since last year's riot.
{80273}{80319}We're getting our business|from people...
{80321}{80392}who want to|protect their families and homes.
{80394}{80443}- Can you hold on a minute?.|- Excuse me.
{80445}{80515}- The damn thing's stuck.|- Point that down.
{80516}{80604}I've only got one head.|There we go. See?. This release.
{80606}{80641}There. Okay?.
{80675}{80729}- Thankyou.|- There you go.
{80771}{80841}- Not bad.|- You ready again?.
{80843}{80890}You want to start again?.
{80915}{80976}Well, I don't know|what you're looking for.
{80978}{81033}If a person|has a driver's license...
{81035}{81097}he has to know how to drive.
{81099}{81202}If a person gets a gun,|he has to know how to use it.
{81204}{81320}How he uses it or what he uses it for|is a personal right.
{81407}{81430}Sorry.
{81431}{81488}- Dick, let me have a dime.|- Sure, John.
{81574}{81632}There you go.
{81634}{81722}I asked him where he was.|He said, "I was on vacation."
{81723}{81764}Hey, loverboy.
{81766}{81813}Dede's looking foryou.
{82119}{82173}- Looking for me?.|- Johnny.
{82199}{82277}- There might be a little problem.|- What is it?.
{82279}{82362}Carlin came around yesterday|kind of mad.
{82364}{82414}Tell me something new.
{82416}{82526}Johnny, you know the outtakes|for that footage?.
{82527}{82594}- You know, the draft-card burners?.|- Yeah.
{82596}{82644}Did you give that|to the light show kids?.
{82646}{82722}For Christ's sakes, don't be cute.|What the hell did he say?.
{82723}{82780}He didn't say anything|definite really.
{82782}{82862}He just complained about you|being out when he needed you...
{82864}{82936}and screwing around,|shooting stupid interviews.
{82938}{83030}What the hell is up?.|Don't tell me what you think.
{83031}{83086}Just tell me what kind|of shit's flying around.
{83087}{83136}Jesus, let go.
{83235}{83288}I'll tell you.
{83388}{83490}Well, for about a year now...
{83491}{83626}the station's been letting|the cops and the FBI...
{83628}{83684}study our footage.
{83725}{83863}You're putting me on.|You're kidding me. What am I, a fink?.
{83865}{83919}How can I go out|and cover a story?.
{83921}{83987}It's a wonder more cameras|haven't been smashed.
{83989}{84046}I want to know why nobody told me|what the hell's been going on...
{84047}{84122}because you can bet|in the streets, they know.
{84124}{84178}You should've told me, Dede.
{84275}{84325}- Just a sec, will you?.|- Is he here?. Where is he?.
{84327}{84377}I want to see him.
{84379}{84467}He won't be in this morning.|This is foryou.
{84600}{84701}Where the hell is he?.|Why won't he be in?.
{84703}{84756}What the hell is this crap?.
{85346}{85457}I don't know what day|it plays. Wha--
{85459}{85532}That was a business call.
{85576}{85598}Accounting.
{85600}{85659}Did you get a severance notice|for John Katselas?.
{85661}{85716}Just a minute.
{85762}{85802}Yes, I have it here.|Who's calling?
{85900}{85974}I'd tell them to|stuff their lousy job in a minute.
{85976}{86035}Well, you know that. I would.
{86087}{86132}I would.
{86134}{86217}As far as I'm concerned,|I'm with you, John.
{86219}{86292}I'll tell the bastards,|"IfJohn goes, then I walkwith him."
{86413}{86460}Well, I gotta get moving.
{86497}{86543}Take it easy, Gus.
{87085}{87123}Remember me?.
{87275}{87320}Yeah.
{87322}{87379}Yeah, I almost didn't|recognize you in that outfit.
{87381}{87443}I work over there at Motorola.
{87528}{87566}Well...
{87568}{87620}it's been good seeing you.
{87686}{87749}How's the pigeon boy doing?.
{87751}{87796}Real good.Just fine.
{87828}{87911}- You always eat here?.|- It's pretty bad, isn't it?.
{87913}{87959}Most times I bring my own.
{88062}{88108}Where you headed?.
{88229}{88276}Did you finish your salad?.
{88277}{88324}You want some of mine?.
{88325}{88360}Sure?.
{88471}{88506}What's the matter?.
{88538}{88604}Maybe it's just that|he's not used to company, huh?.
{88737}{88783}What'd you do back home?.
{88785}{88838}I was a schoolteacher.
{88840}{88899}You were?.|Why aren't you teaching here?.
{88901}{88947}Things are very different up here.
{88949}{89050}Down home I taught five grades|in one room for one thing.
{89052}{89086}Wow.
{89088}{89136}Like the little red schoolhouse.
{89138}{89202}Kind of. But...
{89204}{89303}see, they don't recognize me|as a teacher up here.
{89305}{89399}The education that I had down home|isn't good enough for them...
{89401}{89460}for me to teach here, so I can't.
{89461}{89536}But I'll tell you,|I don't think I'd want to anyway.
{89538}{89589}I wouldn't want to teach|in the schools in this neighborhood.
{89591}{89665}- Why not?.|- They don't teach you nothing.
{89667}{89732}It's a Chicago school.|They got to teach you something.
{89733}{89853}They don't.|They run a television in there.
{89855}{89901}Well, they use TV these days.
{89903}{89949}They use educational--
{89951}{90004}Yeah, but not that kind ofTV.
{90005}{90105}You watch anything you want.|They don't try--
{90107}{90153}When you ask them to--
{90155}{90201}that you want to do some work...
{90203}{90270}they say,|"No, you do what I tell you."
{90272}{90331}- They let you watch TV, is that it?.|- Yeah, that's all.
{90333}{90420}- They don't do nothing else.|- Don't you like TV?.
{90422}{90468}Yeah, but--
{90470}{90519}You're probably doing|what you like.
{90521}{90598}- Where you from?.|- Right here. Chicago.
{90600}{90697}C.Y.O. welterweight boxer, 1 958.
{90726}{90791}You ever boxed?. Or do you|just wrestle when you fight?.
{90793}{90864}People down here use sticks,|rocks...
{90866}{90936}guns, and everything|down here in here.
{90937}{90997}- Nah, you don't use rocks, do you?.|- Yeah.
{90999}{91045}I don't. They do.
{91047}{91143}- Only dirty fighters use rocks.|- And guns and sticks.
{91145}{91186}You got a gun?.
{91188}{91232}Play gun?.
{91233}{91298}That's good.
{91300}{91383}I shot a gun when I was eight--|I mean, ten years old.
{91385}{91485}- Where?.|- West Virginia.
{91487}{91552}I'll take him with me|to C.Y.O. maybe...
{91554}{91627}and let him hit the bag.
{91811}{91850}Can I watch TV?.
{91852}{91939}Help me put the plates in the sink,|and then you can go watch TV.
{92017}{92064}I'll give you a hand here.
{92192}{92238}Is your bird okay?.
{92278}{92343}The other day, I thought you were|stealing something off my car.
{92345}{92393}I don't steal!
{92395}{92479}Anyway, what's so great|about your shitty car?.
{92481}{92536}I brought your bird back, didn't I?.
{92598}{92658}Anyway, it's not my car.
{92866}{92928}Beverly Hillbillies,|normally scheduled forthis time...
{92929}{92967}will not be seen tonight.
{92969}{93032}Instead, we bringyou the third part|ofa network special...
{93033}{93097}on John F. Kennedy,|Martin L uther King...
{93099}{93138}and Robert Kennedy.
{93606}{93652}Why'd they fire you?.
{93654}{93704}Can you get another job?.
{93706}{93788}Can you get welfare?.|I mean, unemployment?.
{93816}{93862}Do I look worried?.
{93913}{94007}Too many questions.|Why they canned me?.
{94009}{94062}I'm not sure I know the answer.
{94116}{94184}I started a story about a cabdriver|who found all that cash...
{94185}{94288}somebody lost and,|for unknown reasons, wouldn't claim.
{94290}{94320}Why?.
{94322}{94384}There's only one kind of money|a guy would be afraid to claim.
{94386}{94435}I had some idea maybe|there was a connection...
{94437}{94484}between guns, vigilante groups...
{94485}{94560}maybe getting ready|for a blowup this summer, you know?.
{94562}{94658}Then I got sort of sidetracked--|interested, so to speak.
{94660}{94718}But nobody said anything about this.
{94720}{94772}My director just told|my union local...
{94773}{94852}I had taken company film|without authorization.
{94854}{94908}You see,|it gets pretty complicated.
{94909}{94978}People rarely say|the real reasons for things.
{94980}{95028}Big corporations never do.
{95054}{95100}Just politics...
{95102}{95188}plain bureaucratic politics.
{95190}{95253}I guess it's the season up here.
{95255}{95323}Anyway, we only been|in Chicago a little while...
{95325}{95380}not even long enough|for me to vote.
{95463}{95548}Come on. Tell me how you managed to|teach five grades in one classroom.
{95581}{95664}I didn't manage.|One thing I did was--
{95666}{95727}Well, I just had three|in the third grade...
{95729}{95781}so I put one boy up to fourth...
{95783}{95833}and a boy and girl back to second.
{95835}{95892}That way I only had four grades.
{95918}{95979}Is that the new math?.
{96648}{96757}Gather with the saints at the river
{96759}{96871}That flows by the throne ofGod
{96897}{97015}Shall we gather at the river
{97017}{97140}Where bright Angel's feet have trod
{97142}{97257}With these Christians at the river
{97260}{97364}That flows by the throne of God
{97396}{97515}Yes, we shall gather at the river
{97517}{97646}The beautiful, beautiful river
{97648}{97758}Gather with the saints at the river
{97760}{97871}That flows by the throne of God
{97896}{98021}Yes, we shall gather at the river
{98023}{98154}The beautiful, beautiful river
{98156}{98263}Gather with the saints at the river
{98264}{98394}That flows by the throne of God
{98414}{98488}Well, I don 't know|what will happen now.
{98490}{98555}We've got some difficult|days ahead...
{98585}{98644}but it doesn 't really matter|with me now...
{98646}{98700}because I've been|to the mountaintop.
{98744}{98790}I don 't mind.
{98862}{98974}Like anybody,|I would like to live a long life.
{98976}{99066}L ongevity has its place...
{99068}{99148}but I'm not concerned|about that now.
{99149}{99205}Ijust want to do God's will.
{99244}{99300}And He's allowed me|to go up to the mountain.
{99302}{99376}- Jesus, I love to shoot film.|- And I've looked over...
{99398}{99453}and I've seen...
{99455}{99512}the promised land.
{99513}{99575}I may not get there with you...
{99577}{99643}but I want you to know tonight...
{99644}{99691}that we, as a people...
{99692}{99752}will get to the promised land.
{99824}{99871}Do you feel it?.
{99872}{99919}X rays, is that what it is?.|Does it grow hair?.
{99920}{99972}Is it vitamins?.
{99974}{100027}Can you feel violence?.
{100028}{100082}I don't know what to think.
{100084}{100173}It seems like no man's life|is worth anything anymore.
{100244}{100295}You see...
{100297}{100344}the media's got a script now...
{100345}{100390}by the numbers.
{100392}{100467}Flags at half-mast.|Trips canceled.
{100468}{100518}Ball games called off.|Schools closed.
{100520}{100567}Flags at half-mast.
{100592}{100650}Memorial meetings.|Memorial marches.
{100652}{100699}Moments of silence.
{100728}{100784}A widow cries,|and then she says brave words.
{100785}{100832}- More moments of silence...|- Standing by...
{100833}{100899}- in our Washington studio is...|- then the funeral procession.
{100901}{100976}a foremost expert on urban violence|on the contemporary scene.
{100978}{101039}A lot of experts...
{101041}{101127}saying how sick our society is,|how sick we all are.
{101172}{101232}The script is a national drain-off.
{101270}{101368}People say, "Yeah, yeah,|we're guilty. We're bad."
{101370}{101428}'Cause a lot of people are afraid.|They're afraid...
{101430}{101508}the Negroes are going to tear up|their stores, burn neighborhoods...
{101510}{101563}so they have this nationwide...
{101565}{101663}coast-to-coast network special|called "Mourn the Martyr."
{101664}{101720}Nobody's really|on the hook, you see?.
{101722}{101802}Traditionally, religion|has supplied the moral backstop.
{101804}{101901}When the script is finished|and Tuesday comes around...
{101903}{101973}or Saturday and...
{101975}{102035}National Drain-Off Week is over...
{102077}{102138}everybody goes pretty much|back to normal.
{102164}{102213}Normal this, normal that.
{102215}{102282}You know, normal.
{102284}{102359}We will be able|to speed up that day...
{102360}{102411}when all ofGod's children--
{102413}{102463}black men and white men...
{102464}{102511}Jews and gentiles...
{102512}{102559}Protestants and Catholics--
{102560}{102611}will be able to join hands...
{102613}{102698}and sing in the words|ofthe old Negro spiritual--
{102700}{102771}Free at last! Free at last!
{102772}{102855}Thank God Almighty,|we are free at last!
{102930}{102976}Goose bumps.
{103002}{103072}It reminds me|of church down home...
{103074}{103129}sitting there with Clovis...
{103131}{103203}and Grandma and Buddy.

{107388}{107428}You know...
{107430}{107497}there's a lot of things that you|don't understand about womenfolks...
{107499}{107567}I want to talk to you about it,|ya hear?.
{107604}{107696}A man has got to be boss|of his home.
{107698}{107772}There ain't no two bosses in|the family because it ain't right.
{107774}{107820}- You understand that?.|- Yeah.
{107822}{107895}The thing I'm trying to show you is|that women don't understand a man.
{107896}{107941}Your home is your castle.
{107943}{108031}I don't care how bad|orwhere you live or what it is.
{108033}{108155}That's your castle, and that woman|was made foryou and belongs to you.
{108157}{108204}You don't belong to her,|but she belongs to you.
{108205}{108302}You twain become one flesh,|and that flesh is you.
{108304}{108358}She belongs to you, you understand?.
{108404}{108498}There's a lot of good womenfolks|in the world, don't get me wrong.
{108500}{108572}I mean, the majority of them,|they get high ideas...
