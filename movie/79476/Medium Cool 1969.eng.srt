1
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,247
Better call an ambulance.

2
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:45,594
- 5251, Chicago.
- 5251.

3
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:47,637
Better send an ambulance
out to the Eisenhower...

4
00:01:47,721 --> 00:01:49,639
in front of
the MacKenzie turnoff.

5
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:53,893
Got a wreck. We got coverage.
We'll send it in with the bike man.

6
00:01:53,976 --> 00:01:56,604
- Ten-four.
- Okay.

7
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,815
5251, clear.

8
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,232
Now, that's his public posture,
but he's the one who's right there...

9
00:04:15,274 --> 00:04:19,319
with his eyes glued to the screen
when the blood starts running--

10
00:04:19,402 --> 00:04:22,572
And he's the one who says,
"Ooh, isn't it horrible?.

11
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,116
Isn't it horrible?.
Let me see some more."

12
00:04:25,158 --> 00:04:27,243
There are a lot of people
who buy The New York Times.

13
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:30,454
What I mean to say
is that it happens--

14
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:34,625
It has happened always,
whether it was a photographer...

15
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,503
or a journalist or a cameraman.

16
00:04:37,586 --> 00:04:40,964
When you are in the middle
of something happening, you--

17
00:04:41,006 --> 00:04:43,258
It is a risk
of the profession.

18
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,428
What's the difference between a person
who types something and a typewriter?.

19
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:50,473
The typewriter doesn't really care
about what's being typed.

20
00:04:51,474 --> 00:04:54,769
But a typewriter's a machine,
and you're not a machine.

21
00:04:56,645 --> 00:04:59,857
Actually, I'm kind of an elongation
of a tape recorder.

22
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:04,528
I've made films on all kinds
of social problems.

23
00:05:04,611 --> 00:05:07,280
The big bombs were the ones
where we went into detail...

24
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:09,532
and showed
why something happened.

25
00:05:09,616 --> 00:05:12,869
Nobody wants to take the time. They'd
rather see 30 seconds of somebody...

26
00:05:12,952 --> 00:05:16,664
getting their skull cracked, turn off
the TV and say, "Let me have a beer."

27
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:19,041
But Hollywood, the news med--

28
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:23,212
Well, our position
is one to-- to record.

29
00:05:23,295 --> 00:05:25,172
The dynamics that are
happening in society--

30
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:27,549
We don't deal
with the static things.

31
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:30,969
We deal with the violence.
We deal with--

32
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:34,347
Who wants to see somebody sitting,
to see somebody lying down...

33
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,475
somebody talking peace,
unless they're talking loud?.

34
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:40,019
The cameraman
makes the choice himself.

35
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:42,604
He's out
to get the blood and guts.

36
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:44,690
I believe that.
The other night on television...

37
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:46,900
there was a fellow in Gary--
in the ghetto.

38
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:49,903
If there's something else that maybe
is nice, that could fill the news...

39
00:05:49,986 --> 00:05:53,990
he'll take the stabbing, even if
he's had 27 minutes of stabbing 
before.

40
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:57,034
They're someplace safe,
away from it. They deplore it...

41
00:05:57,076 --> 00:05:59,412
but they deplore it
like all good people.

42
00:05:59,495 --> 00:06:03,374
All good people deplore problems
at a distance, like Thomas Jefferson.

43
00:06:03,415 --> 00:06:05,667
He loved the common man,
but at a distance.

44
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,419
This is exactly what happened.

45
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:10,464
Five cameramen have been killed,
one in Germany.

46
00:06:10,547 --> 00:06:15,176
He was beat to death by a mob,
literally beat to death-- for UPI.

47
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:19,305
Know the excuse?. The crowd thought
he was taking pictures for the police.

48
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:22,516
They had a couple of fellas
in a civil rights protest...

49
00:06:22,558 --> 00:06:25,686
that were chained together,
and I was taking pictures.

50
00:06:25,769 --> 00:06:27,563
Cops said, "Don't you think
you'd better load the camera?'

51
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:30,190
I says, "I'm not out of film."
They said, "Load it anyway.

52
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,943
We wanna move these guys."
And he starts pushing the lens.

53
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:35,403
I says, "The next time you push me,
I'll fall down and start crying."

54
00:06:35,445 --> 00:06:37,072
He walked away.

55
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:40,450
The 1 20 Angineaux lens,
and yanking back and forth...

56
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:44,537
yelling "Black Power" at me,
and I'm just shaking to death...

57
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:47,122
with a $1,200 lens on the camera.

58
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:50,209
I am in the middle.
I got no place to hide.

59
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:54,796
I'm carrying a 40-pound camera,
trying to get pictures of it.

60
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,092
The rioter wants to beat me up, thinks
I'm trying to identify him for police.

61
00:06:59,175 --> 00:07:02,095
The policeman wants to elbow me
out of the way...

62
00:07:02,136 --> 00:07:05,056
and I'm being gentle about it because
he doesn't want the sergeant to see...

63
00:07:05,097 --> 00:07:09,185
he picked up some guy by his neck
and threw him in the backseat of a 
car.

64
00:07:09,268 --> 00:07:11,895
Then the editor says,
"I want the pictures.

65
00:07:11,937 --> 00:07:14,940
My audience doesn't care
what brought this on."

66
00:07:15,023 --> 00:07:17,859
You have to feed your family.
You need the money.

67
00:07:17,943 --> 00:07:19,861
If you don't bring them back,
you're not going to have a job.

68
00:07:19,944 --> 00:07:24,365
Forget that. I've got a job to do,
and I'm interested in it.

69
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:29,787
The point I resent very much is the 
fact
that wherever I go, I'm beat up.

70
00:07:31,455 --> 00:07:34,041
Shoot into those troops!.
Shoot 'em!

71
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:36,793
Shoot the shit out of 'em!
Get 'em!

72
00:07:36,877 --> 00:07:38,587
You guys are shot!

73
00:07:38,628 --> 00:07:41,298
What kind of country is this?.
What's wrong?.

74
00:07:41,381 --> 00:07:44,509
We're people! Why do you
have soldiers here with bayonets?.

75
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:49,972
We got a captive. Hold on.

76
00:07:58,981 --> 00:08:04,235
That was an unprovoked attack
that was retaliatory--

77
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,779
Not me. Not me.

78
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:08,489
This man has an obsolete weapon.

79
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:10,616
Make love, not war.

80
00:08:11,868 --> 00:08:14,995
They stabbed one of our guys
in the belly.

81
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,457
I am Brigadier General
Richard T. Dunn...

82
00:08:18,499 --> 00:08:22,002
commanding general of the
emergency operation headquarters...

83
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,880
of the Illinois Army
National Guard.

84
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,340
The emergency operation
headquarters...

85
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:31,010
is one which
was established last winter...

86
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,764
for the purpose of planning
and controlling operations...

87
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,183
in the event
of civil disturbances.

88
00:08:38,225 --> 00:08:39,893
Over.

89
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:42,563
Out in the street,
their bayonets are fixed...

90
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:47,150
and they know it's for real
in a real riot in the city.

91
00:08:47,192 --> 00:08:49,611
And here we know
it's more or less--

92
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:51,613
It's a war game, more or less.

93
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:53,031
How's it going so far?

94
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:55,366
I couldn't tell you.
I'm the enemy.

95
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,743
We love you guys.

96
00:08:59,328 --> 00:09:02,081
We have women for you, beer.

97
00:09:02,164 --> 00:09:04,500
Come on!

98
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:08,503
- Sing it, now.
- Glory, glory, hallelujah

99
00:09:16,386 --> 00:09:20,723
His truth is marching on

100
00:09:20,806 --> 00:09:23,350
- When do we want freedom?
- Now!

101
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:26,228
- When do we want equality?
- Now!

102
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,730
- When are we gonna get it?
- Now!

103
00:09:28,772 --> 00:09:32,359
It is what our forefathers fought 
for--
the free choice of people!

104
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,693
Yeah!

105
00:09:34,736 --> 00:09:36,738
This country is changing.

106
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:38,865
It is no longer
for all the people.

107
00:09:38,906 --> 00:09:42,410
- It is for some of the people.
- Yeah!

108
00:09:42,493 --> 00:09:45,663
- We see a war we do not want.
- Yeah!

109
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:48,540
We see an apathy towards
love and brotherhood.

110
00:09:48,582 --> 00:09:49,708
Yeah!

111
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,836
- Bring out the mayor.
- We want the mayor!

112
00:09:54,254 --> 00:09:57,549
- Hold on.
- We want the mayor!

113
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:00,301
We want the mayor!

114
00:10:05,181 --> 00:10:07,933
We'll bring the judge
out to talk to you.

115
00:10:08,017 --> 00:10:11,353
We want the mayor!
We don't want a flunky!

116
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:13,522
We want the mayor!

117
00:10:15,607 --> 00:10:18,610
My friends,
I've stood before you many times.

118
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,695
Tell it to 'em, Mayor!

119
00:10:21,446 --> 00:10:25,575
You elected me mayor of this town
for the last 20 years.

120
00:10:25,616 --> 00:10:27,618
- No, we didn 't!
- Tell it to 'em!

121
00:10:29,203 --> 00:10:32,998
We've given you everything
that we thought you needed.

122
00:10:35,417 --> 00:10:39,588
I've let you use our swimming pool
every 4th of July.

123
00:10:39,629 --> 00:10:42,048
We want it every day of the year!

124
00:10:43,132 --> 00:10:44,676
We've operated--

125
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:48,721
We've operated the liquor store
with a minimum of profit.

126
00:10:48,804 --> 00:10:51,390
Sock it to 'em, baby!
Sock it to 'em.

127
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:56,061
I understand that
you have some problems.

128
00:10:58,605 --> 00:11:02,525
- You have avoided our problems!
- I understand that you have--

129
00:11:04,152 --> 00:11:07,280
I understand that
you have some complaints.

130
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:12,535
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

131
00:11:12,618 --> 00:11:16,872
We shall overcome

132
00:11:25,714 --> 00:11:30,551
Some day

133
00:11:55,032 --> 00:11:56,409
Yeah

134
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:01,622
Get the guys with the cameras.

135
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:15,384
Four, three, two, one.

136
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,096
Fade in.
Richard starts back.

137
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,642
And cue announce.
And keep on coming.

138
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,729
- And hold.
- What's wrong?

139
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,149
Now.
Down and in slowly.

140
00:12:31,191 --> 00:12:32,817
Very slowly.

141
00:12:34,986 --> 00:12:37,321
You riding iris on this,
Jerry, or what?

142
00:12:39,865 --> 00:12:42,493
Slate on one.
Stand by to take.

143
00:12:44,328 --> 00:12:46,872
Roll tape to record.
In, Arnold.

144
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,752
- Stand by.
- Four, three...

145
00:12:52,836 --> 00:12:54,671
two, one.

146
00:12:54,754 --> 00:12:56,506
Fade in.

147
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:06,682
You want to move
over here, please?.

148
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:09,309
Let's go. Time is money.
Let's go.

149
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:12,437
Gus, is the El too loud for you?.

150
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:14,481
No, we can live with it.

151
00:13:17,192 --> 00:13:19,444
Who here
is old enough to vote?.

152
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:22,029
I took my physical last week.

153
00:13:22,113 --> 00:13:24,031
Physical to vote?.

154
00:13:25,116 --> 00:13:28,869
- Why are you working for Kennedy?.
- He's the best.

155
00:13:28,953 --> 00:13:31,497
- He's got long hair.
- He's against the war.

156
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:33,874
- What are you doing here?.
- She's my friend.

157
00:13:33,957 --> 00:13:37,752
He's an idealist. He's for anyone
who hasn't got a chance.

158
00:13:37,836 --> 00:13:41,631
- Who are you for?.
- I don't like him because of 
Oswald...

159
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:43,800
and Dallas and all that.

160
00:13:43,883 --> 00:13:46,469
What does that have
to do with it?.

161
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:48,846
I think he should have
looked into it.

162
00:13:48,888 --> 00:13:51,265
There's a lot of serious questions
that haven't been answered.

163
00:13:51,348 --> 00:13:53,809
In the Saturday Evening Post
there was a statement...

164
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:56,853
that the CIA knew about
Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico...

165
00:13:56,937 --> 00:13:59,606
only two months
before John Kennedy--

166
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,754
May I help you?

167
00:15:21,682 --> 00:15:25,143
Damn it. It looks
like I'm a prime target.

168
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,814
First the hubcaps,
now my radio antenna.

169
00:15:39,323 --> 00:15:41,116
Rotten kids.

170
00:15:41,158 --> 00:15:44,620
What's the difference?. Channel 
Eight's
got more where these came from.

171
00:15:44,661 --> 00:15:46,830
That's not the point.

172
00:15:46,913 --> 00:15:48,331
What?.

173
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:53,420
- Where do you want to go?.
- How about a movie?.

174
00:17:24,128 --> 00:17:26,297
Come on. Go after her!

175
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,924
Attagirl!

176
00:17:29,175 --> 00:17:32,219
In the crotch! Atta baby!
In the crotch!

177
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,520
Kill her!

178
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,022
- Kill her!
- Pull her hair!

179
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,193
- Tie her up!
- Kick her in the back!

180
00:17:49,277 --> 00:17:51,028
Kick her in the back!

181
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:52,446
Yea!

182
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:57,701
Let's see some action!

183
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,954
You're just a chicken!

184
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,795
Go to work. Go to work.

185
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:14,133
Go! Go! Go!

186
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:46,413
- No cheating.
- Goes for you too.

187
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:49,165
That's right.

188
00:18:49,249 --> 00:18:50,875
All right.
Deuces are wild, Robert.

189
00:18:53,127 --> 00:18:54,587
Whoops.

190
00:18:59,341 --> 00:19:01,302
All right.
Show him what to do.

191
00:19:06,723 --> 00:19:08,934
Now, deuces are wild, Robert.

192
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:11,853
They count as anything
you want 'em to.

193
00:19:11,895 --> 00:19:14,272
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

194
00:19:14,355 --> 00:19:17,358
Take this one.
Throw the rest away.

195
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:19,193
- This?.
- How many you want?.

196
00:19:19,277 --> 00:19:22,822
- I want four.
- Four?.

197
00:19:22,905 --> 00:19:25,199
- How many you want?.
- Five.

198
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:27,034
You mean four.

199
00:19:28,577 --> 00:19:30,412
No cheating, now.

200
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:38,961
- Two aces. What do you got?.
- I got two treys.

201
00:19:39,045 --> 00:19:40,755
Two treys.

202
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:45,551
- What'd you do?. You throw--
- I got two aces.

203
00:19:45,634 --> 00:19:48,178
You throwed down
my three nines down, didn't you?.

204
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,930
No, he got 'em.

205
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:52,015
I didn't get 'em.
They're in the deck.

206
00:19:53,517 --> 00:19:56,311
He threw 'em down.

207
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:58,646
Boy, it's hot.
You got anything to drink?.

208
00:20:03,359 --> 00:20:05,611
Miss Horton,
you have anything to drink?.

209
00:20:05,653 --> 00:20:08,405
- There's plenty of water in the sink.
- I don't want any water.

210
00:20:08,489 --> 00:20:11,992
I want a Coke or something.
Let's go get a Coke, Robert.

211
00:20:15,495 --> 00:20:17,455
We'll see you there.

212
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,342
- Where'd your friends go?.
- To get a Coke.

213
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:32,136
Get a Coke?.

214
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,308
- What was you playing?.
- Deuces wild.

215
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,769
- Who won?.
- Nobody.

216
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:42,604
Nobody.

217
00:20:42,687 --> 00:20:45,148
- What's the matter?.
- Nothing.

218
00:20:46,232 --> 00:20:48,818
You're pretty dirty.
You've been working them birds.

219
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:51,987
You'd better go wash up
before we eat supper.

220
00:20:54,948 --> 00:20:56,783
Well, go on.

221
00:20:58,243 --> 00:21:00,120
Go on, now. Get.

222
00:21:44,745 --> 00:21:46,746
We thank Thee, Lord,
for this food.

223
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,250
Bless it to the nourishment
of our bodies. In Thy name we pray.

224
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:51,626
Amen.

225
00:22:24,448 --> 00:22:27,034
"The racing pigeon,
or homing pigeon...

226
00:22:27,117 --> 00:22:31,579
remains faithful to its mate
throughout its life...

227
00:22:31,663 --> 00:22:36,417
provided that the mate
is present at all times...

228
00:22:36,459 --> 00:22:40,421
especially when
the male bird returns...

229
00:22:40,463 --> 00:22:42,631
after a long flight.

230
00:22:42,715 --> 00:22:45,968
In addition,
when the pair has young...

231
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:48,887
this bond is even stronger.

232
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:52,724
If, however,
the family is separated...

233
00:22:52,807 --> 00:22:54,851
for an extended period...

234
00:22:54,934 --> 00:22:59,772
the male pigeon,
not unlike his human counterpart...

235
00:22:59,814 --> 00:23:01,941
can be relied upon...

236
00:23:01,983 --> 00:23:07,905
to seek female companionship
elsewhere. "

237
00:23:10,407 --> 00:23:12,075
Roll it up.

238
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,793
This may be the last time

239
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,466
May be the last time
but I don 't know

240
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:32,344
Well, it may be the last time
you march on the capitol

241
00:23:35,138 --> 00:23:37,682
Well, it may be the last time
you march on Congress

242
00:23:39,517 --> 00:23:42,979
Well, it may be the last time
you march for your freedom

243
00:23:45,565 --> 00:23:47,817
Thinking, this may be the last time

244
00:23:47,858 --> 00:23:49,985
Appalachia.
You see the sign ?.

245
00:23:50,027 --> 00:23:52,279
- Could we get a drink of water 
first?.
- T o hell with the water.

246
00:23:52,363 --> 00:23:54,490
Let's find this guy.

247
00:23:55,908 --> 00:23:58,702
They're behind the Mexicans,
ain't they?.

248
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:02,330
I heard they were behind
the San Francisco contingent.

249
00:24:02,414 --> 00:24:05,917
- This is in this direction here.
- I thought it was a blue tent.

250
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,127
I don't know how these people
listen to this crap.

251
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:11,213
I don't know how long
this is gonna keep going.

252
00:24:11,297 --> 00:24:14,216
- Well, where is it?.
- Let's go this way.

253
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:39,448
I would hope, now that
the California primary is finished...

254
00:24:39,531 --> 00:24:41,408
now that these primaries are over...

255
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:44,286
that we could now concentrate
on having a dialogue...

256
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:48,248
or a debate, I hope,
between the vice president and 
myself...

257
00:24:48,331 --> 00:24:49,958
of what direction
we want to go in.

258
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:59,883
Mayor Yorty has just
sent me a message...

259
00:24:59,967 --> 00:25:02,261
that we've been here
too long already.

260
00:25:04,513 --> 00:25:06,681
- We love you, Bob.
- My thanks to all of you...

261
00:25:06,765 --> 00:25:09,225
and now it's on to Chicago,
and let's win there.

262
00:25:14,397 --> 00:25:16,232
We want Bobby!

263
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:26,158
Oh, no
I don 't believe it

264
00:25:26,241 --> 00:25:30,620
You say that you think
you know the meaning of love

265
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,335
You say love is all we need

266
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:40,087
You say with your love

267
00:25:40,129 --> 00:25:44,425
You could change all of the fools
all of the hate

268
00:25:44,466 --> 00:25:47,928
I think you're probably
out to lunch

269
00:25:56,644 --> 00:25:59,272
You guys here
to cover the funeral?.

270
00:25:59,355 --> 00:26:01,482
Yeah, that's what we're here for.

271
00:26:01,565 --> 00:26:05,110
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

272
00:26:06,111 --> 00:26:07,821
You score?.

273
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:13,201
You left the TV set on.

274
00:26:16,454 --> 00:26:20,208
You know, you can meet a lot of
interesting people in a cocktail 
lounge.

275
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:25,337
You know that for every man in D.C.,
there are four and a half women?.

276
00:26:31,468 --> 00:26:35,263
It's a beautiful city, huh?.
Wow. Beautiful.

277
00:26:37,015 --> 00:26:39,392
Boy, this air-conditioning
really gets you.

278
00:26:45,606 --> 00:26:47,608
Look at these guys.

279
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,488
Couple of hours,
they're all set up.

280
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,703
Twenty, twenty-five camera positions--
like nothing.

281
00:27:04,707 --> 00:27:07,460
They've had experience
since we did J.F.K. in '63.

282
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:33,567
Hello, ladies.

283
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:47,538
What are your plans
for the summer--

284
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,374
this, which will be
a very political summer...

285
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:52,043
and possibly a very hot one.

286
00:27:52,126 --> 00:27:54,336
Oh, well, now,
let's not get into politics.

287
00:27:55,504 --> 00:27:59,800
Well, we always go up
to our place...

288
00:27:59,883 --> 00:28:04,554
up in Ontario, up in Canada.

289
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:06,806
It's a place called Desbras.

290
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:09,350
That's D-E-S. It's French.

291
00:28:09,434 --> 00:28:11,310
It's not like a girl's name.

292
00:28:11,394 --> 00:28:14,647
And, well, about this time of year,
we always start looking forward...

293
00:28:14,730 --> 00:28:19,777
to getting away from the city
and the crowds and the heat.

294
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,821
It's very primitive up there.

295
00:28:22,904 --> 00:28:26,992
And I think sometimes
it's good for the soul...

296
00:28:27,075 --> 00:28:30,912
to get away from civilization,
don't you think so?.

297
00:28:54,183 --> 00:28:56,269
- Hello.
- Hello.

298
00:28:56,352 --> 00:29:00,022
- Is your mother home?.
- Yes. No.

299
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:03,567
- No?. Is she working?.
- Yes.

300
00:29:03,651 --> 00:29:06,612
What time will she be home?.

301
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:09,489
- At 1 2:00.
- I see.

302
00:29:09,573 --> 00:29:13,618
- Now, how long have you lived here?.
- I don't know.

303
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,828
- You don't know?.
- No.

304
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:17,622
Could you tell me where you lived
before you moved here?.

305
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:20,208
- Yes.
- Where?.

306
00:29:20,291 --> 00:29:24,670
- West Virginia.
- I see.

307
00:29:24,753 --> 00:29:26,964
Now, how many rooms do you have?.

308
00:29:27,047 --> 00:29:29,800
- No-- yeah. Four.
- Four rooms.

309
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:33,303
- Do you have a TV set?.
- Yes.

310
00:29:33,386 --> 00:29:34,971
- Do you have a stereo?.
- Yes.

311
00:29:35,055 --> 00:29:38,850
And how many brothers
and sisters do you have?.

312
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:41,602
- None.
- You're the only child?.

313
00:29:41,686 --> 00:29:44,897
- Yes.
- And how old are you?.

314
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,982
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen. Really?.

315
00:29:47,024 --> 00:29:49,651
- And do you go to church?.
- Yes.

316
00:29:49,735 --> 00:29:51,278
That's a good boy.

317
00:29:51,361 --> 00:29:55,282
- Now, what is your father's name?.
- Buddy.

318
00:29:55,365 --> 00:29:57,951
- What?.
- Buddy.

319
00:29:58,034 --> 00:30:00,495
- Does he live here at home with you?.
- No.

320
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:03,289
Could you tell me
where I could find him?.

321
00:30:05,416 --> 00:30:06,876
At Vietnam.

322
00:30:09,003 --> 00:30:11,380
Let's go see
what damage we done up here.

323
00:30:17,052 --> 00:30:20,263
- Look at the holes there.
- Golly!

324
00:30:20,346 --> 00:30:22,307
Look around and see
if you can find another.

325
00:30:25,476 --> 00:30:28,104
Hell, I got something here.
Come here.

326
00:30:28,187 --> 00:30:30,856
I ain't gonna waste this, though.

327
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,524
Drink this.

328
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:42,867
Come on.

329
00:30:46,245 --> 00:30:48,247
- You want to shoot it?.
- Uh-uh.

330
00:30:48,289 --> 00:30:52,042
It ain't gonna hurt you.
Just put a shell in like that.

331
00:30:52,084 --> 00:30:55,045
- It's safe. It won't hurt you at all.
- I don't want to shoot it.

332
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:57,089
Draw it back.

333
00:30:58,215 --> 00:31:00,842
Knock it off of there.
That's all you got to do.

334
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:04,095
Come on. Let's go.

335
00:31:05,138 --> 00:31:07,432
Come on.
Let's go look at pigeons.

336
00:32:07,863 --> 00:32:09,948
Nothings missing. I looked.

337
00:32:15,661 --> 00:32:20,082
You out of shape, pal?.
What's in the basket?.

338
00:32:22,168 --> 00:32:23,419
Dinner.

339
00:32:42,978 --> 00:32:46,732
Why don't you admit it?
Go on.Just say it.

340
00:32:46,857 --> 00:32:49,151
You're a bastard.

341
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,614
Admit it to me.

342
00:32:54,698 --> 00:32:57,659
Admit it to yourself.

343
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:02,288
You're a rotten,
egotistical, selfish...

344
00:33:05,082 --> 00:33:07,167
punchy cameraman.

345
00:33:13,548 --> 00:33:14,800
Well?.

346
00:33:18,386 --> 00:33:19,804
Well?. Well?.

347
00:33:25,226 --> 00:33:27,728
Look at this here. Look.

348
00:33:29,104 --> 00:33:31,565
How do you like it?.
Gus wired it up for me.

349
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,153
Look back there.
Fiber optics. Great, huh?.

350
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,823
See the TV?. Lights.

351
00:33:39,906 --> 00:33:42,742
- Look at that.
- John.

352
00:33:44,577 --> 00:33:48,039
Do you remember
when we saw Mondo Cane?

353
00:33:48,122 --> 00:33:52,084
- We didn't see Mondo Cane.
- Well, I saw it.

354
00:33:52,126 --> 00:33:54,545
I saw it, too, but I don't
remember seeing it with you.

355
00:33:56,713 --> 00:33:59,382
Well, anyway,
that's not the point.

356
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:01,551
What's the point?.

357
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:05,221
Well, you remember that scene...

358
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:08,015
on an island,
where they tested an atom bomb?.

359
00:34:08,099 --> 00:34:09,767
Yeah.

360
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:13,270
Well, there were
these big turtles...

361
00:34:13,312 --> 00:34:17,065
you know, tortoises, who,
at a certain time in their lives...

362
00:34:17,149 --> 00:34:21,153
would walk to the sea
to lay their eggs.

363
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:23,697
And they found that
the radiation thing...

364
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,907
threw the turtles'
sense of direction...

365
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:29,786
so instead of heading to the sea,
they went inland and died.

366
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,288
Oh, I'm crying.

367
00:34:34,874 --> 00:34:36,875
Damn it!

368
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,711
Look, somebody
took those movies, right?.

369
00:34:39,795 --> 00:34:42,923
I mean, do you think
did they or didn't they...

370
00:34:43,006 --> 00:34:46,593
after they took those movies--

371
00:34:46,634 --> 00:34:50,221
Do you think-- Did they reach down
and turn those turtles around...

372
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,891
or did they put them in a jeep
and drive them back?.

373
00:34:53,975 --> 00:34:57,478
How the hell do I know what they did?.
Those were Italian cameramen.

374
00:35:01,315 --> 00:35:04,026
I give up. I surrender.

375
00:35:09,823 --> 00:35:11,699
No calories.

376
00:35:13,326 --> 00:35:15,620
I'd rather
keep my kidneys for a while.

377
00:35:25,379 --> 00:35:29,216
"Research physicians at the Istituto
del Salvador Muni in Rome...

378
00:35:29,299 --> 00:35:31,384
reveal today the results of tests...

379
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,928
involving a new device to be worn
by expectant mothers...

380
00:35:34,012 --> 00:35:36,514
during the entire course
of their pregnancy.

381
00:35:36,597 --> 00:35:39,809
This device consists
of a steel and plastic cylinder...

382
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,853
which can be controlled
to create a partial vacuum...

383
00:35:42,937 --> 00:35:47,482
around the mother's abdomen, reducing
atmospheric pressure on the fetus.

384
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:50,318
This pressure--

385
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:56,199
which is at sea level
1 4.7 pounds per square inch--

386
00:35:56,282 --> 00:35:59,076
can be reduced by as much as 50%.

387
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,203
It was Dr. Giacobo Marciani...

388
00:36:01,287 --> 00:36:03,330
director of
the hospital's research institute...

389
00:36:03,414 --> 00:36:06,583
who first made public the results
of the test involving the new device.

390
00:36:07,376 --> 00:36:10,671
Although it is anticipated
that the price...

391
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,672
in the early stages
of development, at least...

392
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:17,343
will be prohibited--
prohibiti-- prohibitive--

393
00:36:17,385 --> 00:36:19,262
official comment
on the new device...

394
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,889
has not yet been forthcoming
from the Vatican."

395
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,063
Don't!

396
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,276
You're crazy!

397
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,948
No! Give me my sheet back! John!

398
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:44,285
Give me that!

399
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:52,876
I got you! You bastard!
Son of a bitch!

400
00:36:53,919 --> 00:36:55,879
Let go of me, you fuck!

401
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:00,967
Help! No, not on the floor!

402
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,511
Jesus, you!

403
00:37:03,595 --> 00:37:05,972
Help! Put me down! Help!

404
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:10,893
You bastard!
Let go of me, you prick!

405
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:13,437
Naughty, naughty.
I got neighbors.

406
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:16,315
- Son of a bitch!
- I got neighbors. Be quiet.

407
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:21,403
Catch you in the act.
They'll bust your arms. I like you.

408
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:23,905
Me too.

409
00:37:31,662 --> 00:37:33,622
I'm gonna knock the shit
out of you.

410
00:37:34,707 --> 00:37:35,916
Ouch!

411
00:37:41,088 --> 00:37:43,173
There he goes.

412
00:37:43,256 --> 00:37:44,966
One good deed a year.

413
00:37:45,008 --> 00:37:46,968
I heard that.

414
00:39:15,091 --> 00:39:18,970
- You dropped your newspaper.
- Who are you?.

415
00:39:19,053 --> 00:39:22,848
"Horton.
4444 North Clifton."

416
00:39:22,932 --> 00:39:25,559
I think this belongs
to your little brother.

417
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:28,270
I don't have a brother.
It belongs to my son.

418
00:39:30,606 --> 00:39:32,774
Mr. Horton go for green beans?.

419
00:39:43,909 --> 00:39:46,829
- Man.
- Not on the car.

420
00:39:46,912 --> 00:39:49,832
Not on the car.
Come on. Get off the car.

421
00:39:49,915 --> 00:39:53,043
Come on. Off the car.
Come on.

422
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:57,964
Get out of there.
Come on.

423
00:40:04,971 --> 00:40:07,181
Come on. Out of the car.

424
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:09,308
This is an official car.
Come on.

425
00:40:10,392 --> 00:40:15,063
- All those kids out there yours?.
- No. They belong to my neighbors.

426
00:40:15,105 --> 00:40:18,233
- Are you from the mountains?.
- West Virginia.

427
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,610
- Just spent three weeks there.
- You did?.

428
00:40:21,528 --> 00:40:26,240
We sure starve a lot
when the stamps run out.

429
00:40:26,282 --> 00:40:29,618
Trouble is, you can't
get no "tobaccy" on stamps.

430
00:40:29,702 --> 00:40:31,620
So you know about the stamps.

431
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:35,624
No, not really. I did this 
documentary.
Those words are on a tape.

432
00:40:52,098 --> 00:40:54,475
Hello, Marian, this is Gus.

433
00:40:54,558 --> 00:40:57,978
Page Katselas on number 51 2.

434
00:40:58,061 --> 00:41:00,605
Have him report
to the wagon immediately.

435
00:41:00,689 --> 00:41:02,232
Ten-four. Ten-four.

436
00:41:02,315 --> 00:41:05,068
I could've let the bird go.
He would've flown back...

437
00:41:05,151 --> 00:41:07,820
but I don't know how he would've
carried the basket.

438
00:41:07,862 --> 00:41:10,156
It might've flown back
to West Virginia.

439
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:13,034
Harold spends all his time
trying to retrain him.

440
00:41:13,117 --> 00:41:15,494
- How long you been up here?.
- Not too long.

441
00:41:19,373 --> 00:41:23,293
- John, call the office.
- You got a telephone around here?.

442
00:41:23,335 --> 00:41:25,003
In the hall.

443
00:41:39,266 --> 00:41:41,185
Katselas here.

444
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,355
Yeah, but he's right outsi--

445
00:41:45,439 --> 00:41:48,608
He did, huh?. Yeah, all right.

446
00:41:48,692 --> 00:41:50,819
Anything else?.

447
00:41:50,902 --> 00:41:53,154
All right. Thank you.

448
00:41:58,534 --> 00:42:03,414
You tell Harold the bad guy from
the parking lot brought his bird back.

449
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:08,502
- You tell him. Hear?.
- I will.

450
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:19,845
You mind turning this off?.

451
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:24,725
We're gonna make sound.
Would you shut this off?.

452
00:42:24,808 --> 00:42:27,227
- Shut it off!
- All right.

453
00:42:29,896 --> 00:42:32,857
Where was the money really located?.

454
00:42:32,941 --> 00:42:34,943
Was it stuffed in the seat?.

455
00:42:35,026 --> 00:42:37,403
It was in an envelope
on the floor.

456
00:42:37,445 --> 00:42:39,405
What kind of envelope?.

457
00:42:41,532 --> 00:42:43,534
What kind of an envelope was it?.

458
00:42:43,617 --> 00:42:45,828
Ask him.
He's counting the money there.

459
00:42:45,911 --> 00:42:49,039
He's counting the money.
How much money is it?.

460
00:42:49,122 --> 00:42:51,667
- How much money is it?.
- Don't ask him.

461
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:54,085
I want to know from you.
How much money did you have?.

462
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:57,130
How much did you count?.
Did you count the money?.

463
00:42:57,213 --> 00:42:59,966
- $1 0,000.
- You sure it was $1 0,000?.

464
00:43:00,049 --> 00:43:02,635
It wasn't 9,000?. Wasn't 1 1,000?.

465
00:43:02,718 --> 00:43:05,554
9,000?. $1 0,000, right?.

466
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:09,600
It was 9,000. I put 1,000 of mine
to make it 1 0,000.

467
00:43:09,683 --> 00:43:11,476
What you gonna do?.
Get funny now?.

468
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,563
Gonna start putting me on?.
Let's not play games with each other.

469
00:43:14,646 --> 00:43:19,567
I'm here to find out why you
turned in $1 0,000. Where did you get 
it?.

470
00:43:19,609 --> 00:43:23,362
Aren't you thankful
I did turn in $1 0,000?.

471
00:43:23,446 --> 00:43:26,657
Maybe not. I'm a policeman.
I'm just here to find out the facts.

472
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:25,420
Just tell her we cover the news.
We do not manufacture violence.

473
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:27,463
Talk to her, okay?.

474
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:33,594
Mrs. Harris, I'm re-- Well?.

475
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:36,096
Remember the shot of the cabby
who turned the money in?.

476
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,807
- Forget it.
- There's a story there, Carlin.

477
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:42,477
A lot of people are interested.
I think it'll go on the Sunday 
reports.

478
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:45,897
No. I got a convention
coming up, a war...

479
00:44:45,981 --> 00:44:48,983
I got baseball,
a nervous city...

480
00:44:49,067 --> 00:44:51,652
plus I got chickenshit cameramen
that are afraid...

481
00:44:51,736 --> 00:44:54,197
to go into the ghetto
without police protection.

482
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:58,367
No. Stay out
of those neighborhoods...

483
00:44:58,450 --> 00:44:59,827
until I send you in there.

484
00:44:59,868 --> 00:45:02,579
- I want film and lab.
- They got film.

485
00:45:02,663 --> 00:45:07,042
- I want film and lab.
- Would you please stop bothering me?.

486
00:45:07,083 --> 00:45:10,378
Mr. Evans's office on line six.

487
00:45:10,462 --> 00:45:14,882
Write up a voucher.
Yes, sir. Good morning.

488
00:45:14,966 --> 00:45:18,886
Hey, TV man.
Are we gonna be on TV?.

489
00:45:18,969 --> 00:45:21,680
We wanna be on TV.

490
00:45:21,722 --> 00:45:25,934
- TV, that's for us.
- Hey, TV man! What's happening?.

491
00:45:26,018 --> 00:45:29,896
...slaughtered Philadelphia 9-0.

492
00:45:29,938 --> 00:45:33,233
And finally, it was the Mets
walloping the Pirates.

493
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,071
- Locked?.
- Yeah.

494
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:44,034
-You know you're two blocks away?.
-I had some trouble in there last 
night. 
.

495
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:46,036
Thought we'd keep the equipment safe.

496
00:45:49,498 --> 00:45:51,708
White bread on sandwiches
is not too cool.

497
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,713
- Come on, now.
- No. That's out of it. O-U-T. Out.

498
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:59,757
I don't think we have any other kind,
but I'll take a look-see.

499
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:04,553
Frank, I dug your name
in the paper.

500
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:08,766
You're somewhat of a celebrity now.
Want to fill me in?.

501
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,517
Well, I'm not
really a celebrity...

502
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:15,814
but, yeah, I found the bread,
and I turned it in.

503
00:46:15,897 --> 00:46:17,440
- You turned it in.
- Uh-huh.

504
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,610
Were you acting as a Negro
or a black man?.

505
00:46:20,693 --> 00:46:22,737
I'm concerned about this.

506
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:24,905
What do you mean, was I acting
as a Negro or black man?.

507
00:46:24,989 --> 00:46:28,659
If you were acting as a black man,
you would've kept the money.

508
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:32,454
If you were acting as a Negro,
you turned it in.

509
00:46:32,537 --> 00:46:36,249
You're my man.
You're my man and everything.

510
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:39,502
- How much money was that?.
- $1 0,000.

511
00:46:39,586 --> 00:46:42,171
$1 0,000?. You kidding?.

512
00:46:42,964 --> 00:46:45,007
Dig, now, look. You know--

513
00:46:45,091 --> 00:46:49,386
Do you realize
how much ammunition and guns...

514
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:52,723
$1 0,000 would've bought?.

515
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:54,975
Well, I'm not quite there yet.

516
00:46:55,058 --> 00:46:58,979
But I'm talking about,
you got to be alive to be honest.

517
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,358
- What you doing around here, man?
- Just buying some cigarettes.

518
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:06,944
You ain't got no right coming here
to buy no cigarettes.

519
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,742
Guys like you get shot all up,
you know?.

520
00:47:13,826 --> 00:47:17,162
-Yeah.
-Don't come here for cigarettes.

521
00:47:17,246 --> 00:47:19,164
You know what I mean?.

522
00:48:01,703 --> 00:48:03,914
We have a visitor.

523
00:48:05,999 --> 00:48:08,835
- Frank Baker live here?.
- Frank Baker live here?.

524
00:48:08,877 --> 00:48:12,255
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?.
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?.

525
00:48:12,338 --> 00:48:14,924
- Does he live here?.
- Does he live here?.

526
00:48:15,007 --> 00:48:18,302
- Yeah. Does he live here?.
- Does he live here?.

527
00:48:18,385 --> 00:48:20,721
There's no Frank cabdriver here.

528
00:48:23,724 --> 00:48:28,853
You don't know him?. He's a cabdriver.
I did a story on him. I'm a reporter.

529
00:48:28,937 --> 00:48:31,397
- What's his name again?.
- Frank Baker.

530
00:48:31,481 --> 00:48:34,650
- Frank Baker.
- Come on. You're putting the guy on.

531
00:48:34,734 --> 00:48:37,111
This is the guy
who put me on television.

532
00:48:37,194 --> 00:48:39,697
- How you doing?.
- Very well. I don't want to bust in.

533
00:48:39,738 --> 00:48:42,324
I just wondered
if you got five minutes to talk.

534
00:48:43,575 --> 00:48:45,786
- Let's do it over a drink.
- Good.

535
00:48:54,335 --> 00:48:57,588
You know, Chicago cops...

536
00:48:57,672 --> 00:49:00,216
are getting
funnier-looking every day.

537
00:49:03,427 --> 00:49:06,638
- I'm not a cop. I'm a soundman.
- Bet you got credentials too.

538
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:10,100
The FBI supplies
the best credentials.

539
00:49:11,309 --> 00:49:13,770
We know
that one of the best ways...

540
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:17,398
for spying on black people
is to impersonate TV men.

541
00:49:17,482 --> 00:49:19,650
We're talking to Frank
about doing a story.

542
00:49:19,734 --> 00:49:22,403
- Yeah?. What's that?.
- That's my Pageboy.

543
00:49:23,904 --> 00:49:26,949
- Your Pageboy?.
- Yeah.

544
00:49:28,117 --> 00:49:32,037
Hey, Richard,
come and dig this cat's Pageboy.

545
00:49:33,121 --> 00:49:37,083
Now, what do you do
with "my Pageboy"?.

546
00:49:37,125 --> 00:49:38,877
Well, I don't do anything.
It just hangs there.

547
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:42,922
If they want me to go someplace
or do something, they call me on it.

548
00:49:43,005 --> 00:49:48,010
You mean,
they give you orders on this.

549
00:49:48,093 --> 00:49:50,012
Yeah.

550
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:57,185
Man, you mean to tell me they talk
to you, and you can't talk back?.

551
00:49:58,353 --> 00:50:01,356
He means he's a receiver
and not a sender.

552
00:50:03,524 --> 00:50:06,152
Looks like they're
calling you now.

553
00:50:06,235 --> 00:50:08,154
What, you a white flunky
or something?.

554
00:50:08,195 --> 00:50:11,949
Wrong. You got a bad idea about--

555
00:50:11,991 --> 00:50:14,826
I forgot something downstairs.
I'll meet you in the car.

556
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:16,453
All right.

557
00:50:16,495 --> 00:50:19,247
Coming back.
He's coming back.

558
00:50:19,331 --> 00:50:22,167
There he goes.
There he goes.

559
00:50:22,208 --> 00:50:24,168
A honky flunky.

560
00:50:26,295 --> 00:50:28,631
Look, man,
I've been on television...

561
00:50:28,673 --> 00:50:32,635
I've been in the newspapers,
and it's made my life total confusion.

562
00:50:32,718 --> 00:50:37,180
I find $1 0,000 in a cab.
I'm boob enough to turn it in...

563
00:50:37,222 --> 00:50:39,599
and I get my butt kicked
by everybody in the world.

564
00:50:39,683 --> 00:50:42,852
- No, man.
- That's just it, Frank.

565
00:50:42,936 --> 00:50:46,356
It's a human interest story.
People identify.

566
00:50:46,439 --> 00:50:48,649
- It'll be constructive.
- Are you coming, Frank?.

567
00:50:48,733 --> 00:50:51,610
I'll give you a call, and
we'll have another talk about it.

568
00:50:51,694 --> 00:50:53,028
Thank you.

569
00:50:54,155 --> 00:50:57,699
Excuse me, TV man, you wanted
someone for an interview, right?.

570
00:50:57,783 --> 00:50:59,576
I haven't got time
right now, dear. I gotta run.

571
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,662
But I wanted to talk to you.
See, I'm a black actress.

572
00:51:02,746 --> 00:51:05,832
- Listen, honey-- I haven't got time--
- Don't "honey" me.

573
00:51:05,915 --> 00:51:10,086
I'm a black actress.
I demand respect. I'm not looking 
for--

574
00:51:10,169 --> 00:51:14,423
- You call the station.
- No. You said you wanted somebody.

575
00:51:14,507 --> 00:51:17,551
You want to hear-- know what's
going on, what black people are 
doing?.

576
00:51:17,635 --> 00:51:20,220
- I'm not interested.
- Wait, wait.

577
00:51:20,304 --> 00:51:24,391
- Don't "honey" me.
- You got to start respecting our 
women.

578
00:51:24,474 --> 00:51:28,520
I have no disrespect in mind.
I gotta leave. I don't have time.

579
00:51:28,603 --> 00:51:31,189
I want to talk to you
about what I'd like to do.

580
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:35,776
You people are always busy
putting your kind of people on.

581
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:38,112
I want to talk to you
about what I want.

582
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:41,115
- Listen, dear.
- I told you about that "dear."

583
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:44,701
- I'm trying to be very respectful.
- We demand--

584
00:51:44,785 --> 00:51:47,579
- You demand what?.
- Demand respect.

585
00:51:50,623 --> 00:51:52,250
- Handle it.
- I'll try.

586
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:56,462
- Don't call me "honey."
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

587
00:51:56,546 --> 00:52:00,382
-This is the guy that came by the 
house.
-I know the guy.

588
00:52:00,466 --> 00:52:03,635
So don't give him a bad time.

589
00:52:03,719 --> 00:52:05,304
Leave him alone.
He's all right.

590
00:52:05,387 --> 00:52:07,764
- Come on, baby.
- He's a jive--

591
00:52:07,848 --> 00:52:12,560
Wait a minute.
I want to talk to you. Come in.

592
00:52:12,644 --> 00:52:15,271
Let me ask you something.
Are you being friendly?.

593
00:52:15,313 --> 00:52:19,108
Am I being friendly?.
I just saved your life.

594
00:52:19,192 --> 00:52:21,944
- If I got to be afraid--
- You understand I just saved your 
life?.

595
00:52:21,986 --> 00:52:26,323
If I got to be afraid for your 
argument
to work, you got no argument.

596
00:52:26,407 --> 00:52:29,576
I want you to understand
I saved your life.

597
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:33,955
You came down here to do some sort
of jive interview.

598
00:52:33,997 --> 00:52:39,127
You did that. Came down here with
1 5 minutes of a black sensibility...

599
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:41,337
and so you don't understand that.

600
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:43,130
You came down here
to shoot 1 5 minutes...

601
00:52:43,214 --> 00:52:46,133
of what has taken 300 years
to develop.

602
00:52:46,175 --> 00:52:48,385
- Grief, you know?.
- I'm not interested in grief--

603
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:52,639
All we're trying to explain to you
is that you don't understand.

604
00:52:52,723 --> 00:52:55,392
I do something.
I do it well. That's my job.

605
00:52:55,475 --> 00:53:00,104
You don't do it black enough. You 
can't,
because you're not black. We are.

606
00:53:00,188 --> 00:53:04,150
When you come and say you've come
to do something of human interest...

607
00:53:04,233 --> 00:53:07,653
it makes a person wonder whether
you're going to do something...

608
00:53:07,695 --> 00:53:11,907
of interest to other humans, or 
whether
you consider the person human...

609
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:13,825
in whom you're interested.

610
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:16,912
You have
to understand that too.

611
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:20,707
You can't just walk in
out of your arrogance...

612
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:23,292
and expect things
to be like they are...

613
00:53:23,376 --> 00:53:25,962
because when you walked in,
you brought La Salle Street with 
you...

614
00:53:26,045 --> 00:53:30,591
City Hall and all
the mass communications media.

615
00:53:30,674 --> 00:53:34,428
And you are the exploiters.
You're the ones who distort...

616
00:53:34,511 --> 00:53:40,016
and ridicule and emasculate us,
and that ain't cool.

617
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,353
You don't want to know, man.
You don't know the people.

618
00:53:43,436 --> 00:53:45,688
You don't show the people.

619
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:48,399
Here's some cat
who's down and out, you dig?.

620
00:53:48,482 --> 00:53:50,943
He's nobody,
so he says to his old man...

621
00:53:51,026 --> 00:53:54,613
"I'm nobody. I'm gonna die,

622
00:53:54,697 --> 00:53:57,157
and ain't nobody
gonna know I lived," dig?.

623
00:53:57,241 --> 00:54:01,328
So the cat finds a brick and
throws it through Charlie's window...

624
00:54:01,411 --> 00:54:04,622
or he takes a gun
and he shoots.

625
00:54:04,706 --> 00:54:08,000
Then the cat lives, man.
He really lives, dig?.

626
00:54:08,084 --> 00:54:10,920
A hundred million people
see the cat on the tube.

627
00:54:11,003 --> 00:54:13,672
They say,
"The former invisible man lives."

628
00:54:13,756 --> 00:54:18,093
Everybody knows about his wife
and kids-- everything, you dig?.

629
00:54:18,177 --> 00:54:22,931
'Cause the tube is life, man. Life.

630
00:54:23,014 --> 00:54:27,435
You make him an Emmy, man.
You make him the TV star of the 
hour...

631
00:54:27,477 --> 00:54:31,439
on the 6:00, the 1 0:00
and the 1 2:00 news.

632
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:33,774
'Cause what the cat is saying
is truth, man.

633
00:54:33,858 --> 00:54:37,486
Why don't you find out
what really is?.

634
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:39,613
Why you always got to wait
till somebody gets killed?.

635
00:54:39,696 --> 00:54:41,490
'Cause somebody is gonna get killed.

636
00:55:03,051 --> 00:55:05,053
Is that thing loaded?.

637
00:55:05,137 --> 00:55:06,638
As a matter of fact,
they call it a shotgun.

638
00:55:06,721 --> 00:55:08,723
It looks about 1 2-gauge.

639
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:13,186
- Let's go over here.
- Okay.

640
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:18,107
There's a good background.
Very good.

641
00:55:18,149 --> 00:55:20,443
- We can't shoot here.
- What do you mean?.

642
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:22,778
Too noisy.
Those gunshots will wipe us out.

643
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:27,240
It's always too noisy, isn't it?.
Let's go back over here.

644
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:30,035
- Good for you?.
- Yeah, fine.

645
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:33,705
- Pepsi machine. Good enough?.
- Fine.

646
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:35,665
Excuse me.

647
00:55:35,748 --> 00:55:39,168
- What do I do now?.
- Just speak in a normal tone of 
voice.

648
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,545
Rolling here. Rolling.

649
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:44,715
Well, there's been
about a 46% increase...

650
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:47,342
in pistol registration
since last year's riot.

651
00:55:47,426 --> 00:55:49,344
We're getting our business
from people...

652
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:52,389
who want to
protect their families and homes.

653
00:55:52,472 --> 00:55:54,516
- Can you hold on a minute?.
- Excuse me.

654
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:57,518
- The damn thing's stuck.
- Point that down.

655
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,230
I've only got one head.
There we go. See?. This release.

656
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:02,773
There. Okay?.

657
00:56:04,191 --> 00:56:06,443
- Thank you.
- There you go.

658
00:56:08,195 --> 00:56:11,114
- Not bad.
- You ready again?.

659
00:56:11,198 --> 00:56:13,158
You want to start again?.

660
00:56:14,201 --> 00:56:16,745
Well, I don't know
what you're looking for.

661
00:56:16,828 --> 00:56:19,122
If a person
has a driver's license...

662
00:56:19,205 --> 00:56:21,791
he has to know how to drive.

663
00:56:21,874 --> 00:56:26,170
If a person gets a gun,
he has to know how to use it.

664
00:56:26,253 --> 00:56:31,091
How he uses it or what he uses it for
is a personal right.

665
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,679
Sorry.

666
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,098
- Dick, let me have a dime.
- Sure, John.

667
00:56:41,684 --> 00:56:44,103
There you go.

668
00:56:44,187 --> 00:56:47,857
I asked him where he was.
He said, "I was on vacation."

669
00:56:47,898 --> 00:56:49,608
Hey, loverboy.

670
00:56:49,692 --> 00:56:51,652
Dede's looking for you.

671
00:57:04,414 --> 00:57:06,666
- Looking for me?.
- Johnny.

672
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:11,003
- There might be a little problem.
- What is it?.

673
00:57:11,087 --> 00:57:14,548
Carlin came around yesterday
kind of mad.

674
00:57:14,631 --> 00:57:16,717
Tell me something new.

675
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,388
Johnny, you know the outtakes
for that footage?.

676
00:57:21,429 --> 00:57:24,224
- You know, the draft-card burners?.
- Yeah.

677
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,309
Did you give that
to the light show kids?.

678
00:57:26,392 --> 00:57:29,562
For Christ's sakes, don't be cute.
What the hell did he say?.

679
00:57:29,604 --> 00:57:31,981
He didn't say anything
definite really.

680
00:57:32,064 --> 00:57:35,401
He just complained about you
being out when he needed you...

681
00:57:35,484 --> 00:57:38,487
and screwing around,
shooting stupid interviews.

682
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:42,407
What the hell is up?.
Don't tell me what you think.

683
00:57:42,449 --> 00:57:44,743
Just tell me what kind
of shits flying around.

684
00:57:44,784 --> 00:57:46,828
Jesus, let go.

685
00:57:50,957 --> 00:57:53,167
I'll tell you.

686
00:57:57,338 --> 00:58:01,592
Well, for about a year now...

687
00:58:01,633 --> 00:58:07,263
the station's been letting
the cops and the FBI...

688
00:58:07,347 --> 00:58:09,682
study our footage.

689
00:58:11,392 --> 00:58:17,148
You're putting me on.
You're kidding me. What am I, a fink?.

690
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:19,483
How can I go out
and cover a story?.

691
00:58:19,567 --> 00:58:22,319
It's a wonder more cameras
haven't been smashed.

692
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:24,780
I want to know why nobody told me
what the hell's been going on...

693
00:58:24,821 --> 00:58:27,949
because you can bet
in the streets, they know.

694
00:58:28,033 --> 00:58:30,285
You should've told me, Dede.

695
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:36,415
- Just a sec, will you?.
- Is he here?. Where is he?.

696
00:58:36,499 --> 00:58:38,584
I want to see him.

697
00:58:38,668 --> 00:58:42,338
He won't be in this morning.
This is for you.

698
00:58:47,884 --> 00:58:52,097
Where the hell is he?.
Why won't he be in?.

699
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,390
What the hell is this crap?.

700
00:59:18,997 --> 00:59:23,626
I don't know what day
it plays. Wha--

701
00:59:23,709 --> 00:59:26,754
That was a business call.

702
00:59:28,589 --> 00:59:29,506
Accounting.

703
00:59:29,590 --> 00:59:32,050
Did you get a severance notice
for John Katselas?.

704
00:59:32,134 --> 00:59:34,427
Just a minute.

705
00:59:36,346 --> 00:59:38,014
Yes, I have it here.
Who's calling?

706
00:59:42,101 --> 00:59:45,187
I'd tell them to
stuff their lousy job in a minute.

707
00:59:45,271 --> 00:59:47,731
Well, you know that. I would.

708
00:59:49,900 --> 00:59:51,777
I would.

709
00:59:51,860 --> 00:59:55,322
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm with you, John.

710
00:59:55,405 --> 00:59:58,450
I'll tell the bastards,
"If John goes, then I walk with him."

711
01:00:03,496 --> 01:00:05,456
Well, I gotta get moving.

712
01:00:06,999 --> 01:00:08,918
Take it easy, Gus.

713
01:00:31,522 --> 01:00:33,107
Remember me?.

714
01:00:39,446 --> 01:00:41,323
Yeah.

715
01:00:41,406 --> 01:00:43,783
Yeah, I almost didn't
recognize you in that outfit.

716
01:00:43,867 --> 01:00:46,452
I work over there at Motorola.

717
01:00:49,997 --> 01:00:51,582
Well...

718
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:53,834
it's been good seeing you.

719
01:00:56,587 --> 01:00:59,214
How's the pigeon boy doing?.

720
01:00:59,298 --> 01:01:01,174
Real good.Just fine.

721
01:01:02,509 --> 01:01:05,970
- You always eat here?.
- It's pretty bad, isn't it?.

722
01:01:06,054 --> 01:01:07,972
Most times I bring my own.

723
01:01:12,268 --> 01:01:14,186
Where you headed?.

724
01:01:19,233 --> 01:01:21,193
Did you finish your salad?.

725
01:01:21,235 --> 01:01:23,195
You want some of mine?.

726
01:01:23,236 --> 01:01:24,696
Sure?.

727
01:01:29,325 --> 01:01:30,785
What's the matter?.

728
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:34,872
Maybe it's just that
he's not used to company, huh?.

729
01:01:40,419 --> 01:01:42,337
What'd you do back home?.

730
01:01:42,421 --> 01:01:44,631
I was a schoolteacher.

731
01:01:44,715 --> 01:01:47,175
You were?.
Why aren't you teaching here?.

732
01:01:47,259 --> 01:01:49,177
Things are very different up here.

733
01:01:49,261 --> 01:01:53,473
Down home I taught five grades
in one room for one thing.

734
01:01:53,556 --> 01:01:54,974
Wow.

735
01:01:55,058 --> 01:01:57,059
Like the little red schoolhouse.

736
01:01:57,143 --> 01:01:59,812
Kind of. But...

737
01:01:59,895 --> 01:02:04,024
see, they don't recognize me
as a teacher up here.

738
01:02:04,108 --> 01:02:08,028
The education that I had down home
isn't good enough for them...

739
01:02:08,111 --> 01:02:10,572
for me to teach here, so I can't.

740
01:02:10,614 --> 01:02:13,742
But I'll tell you,
I don't think I'd want to anyway.

741
01:02:13,825 --> 01:02:15,952
I wouldn't want to teach
in the schools in this neighborhood.

742
01:02:16,035 --> 01:02:19,121
- Why not?.
- They don't teach you nothing.

743
01:02:19,205 --> 01:02:21,916
It's a Chicago school.
They got to teach you something.

744
01:02:21,957 --> 01:02:26,962
They don't.
They run a television in there.

745
01:02:27,045 --> 01:02:28,964
Well, they use TV these days.

746
01:02:29,047 --> 01:02:30,966
They use educational--

747
01:02:31,049 --> 01:02:33,260
Yeah, but not that kind of TV.

748
01:02:33,301 --> 01:02:37,472
You watch anything you want.
They don't try--

749
01:02:37,555 --> 01:02:39,474
When you ask them to--

750
01:02:39,557 --> 01:02:41,475
that you want to do some work...

751
01:02:41,559 --> 01:02:44,353
they say,
"No, you do what I tell you."

752
01:02:44,437 --> 01:02:46,897
- They let you watch TV, is that it?.
- Yeah, that's all.

753
01:02:46,981 --> 01:02:50,609
- They don't do nothing else.
- Don't you like TV?.

754
01:02:50,692 --> 01:02:52,611
Yeah, but--

755
01:02:52,694 --> 01:02:54,738
You're probably doing
what you like.

756
01:02:54,821 --> 01:02:58,032
- Where you from?.
- Right here. Chicago.

757
01:02:58,116 --> 01:03:02,161
C.Y.O. welterweight boxer, 1 958.

758
01:03:03,371 --> 01:03:06,082
You ever boxed?. Or do you
just wrestle when you fight?.

759
01:03:06,165 --> 01:03:09,126
People down here use sticks,
rocks...

760
01:03:09,209 --> 01:03:12,129
guns, and everything
down here in here.

761
01:03:12,171 --> 01:03:14,673
- Nah, you don't use rocks, do you?.
- Yeah.

762
01:03:14,756 --> 01:03:16,675
I don't. They do.

763
01:03:16,758 --> 01:03:20,762
- Only dirty fighters use rocks.
- And guns and sticks.

764
01:03:20,845 --> 01:03:22,555
You got a gun?.

765
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:24,474
Play gun?.

766
01:03:24,515 --> 01:03:27,226
That's good.

767
01:03:27,310 --> 01:03:30,771
I shot a gun when I was eight--
I mean, ten years old.

768
01:03:30,855 --> 01:03:35,025
- Where?.
- West Virginia.

769
01:03:35,108 --> 01:03:37,819
I'll take him with me
to C.Y.O. maybe...

770
01:03:37,903 --> 01:03:40,947
and let him hit the bag.

771
01:03:48,621 --> 01:03:50,247
Can I watch TV?.

772
01:03:50,331 --> 01:03:53,959
Help me put the plates in the sink,
and then you can go watch TV.

773
01:03:57,212 --> 01:03:59,172
I'll give you a hand here.

774
01:04:04,511 --> 01:04:06,429
Is your bird okay?.

775
01:04:08,097 --> 01:04:10,808
The other day, I thought you were
stealing something off my car.

776
01:04:10,892 --> 01:04:12,893
I don't steal!

777
01:04:12,977 --> 01:04:16,480
Anyway, what's so great
about your shitty car?.

778
01:04:16,563 --> 01:04:18,857
I brought your bird back, didn't I?.

779
01:04:21,443 --> 01:04:23,945
Anyway, it's not my car.

780
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:35,206
Beverly Hillbillies,
normally scheduled for this time...

781
01:04:35,247 --> 01:04:36,832
will not be seen tonight.

782
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,543
Instead, we bring you the third part
of a network special...

783
01:04:39,585 --> 01:04:42,254
on John F. Kennedy,
Martin L uther King...

784
01:04:42,337 --> 01:04:43,964
and Robert Kennedy.

785
01:05:03,482 --> 01:05:05,400
Why'd they fire you?.

786
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,569
Can you get another job?.

787
01:05:07,652 --> 01:05:11,072
Can you get welfare?.
I mean, unemployment?.

788
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:14,158
Do I look worried?.

789
01:05:16,285 --> 01:05:20,206
Too many questions.
Why they canned me?.

790
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:22,499
I'm not sure I know the answer.

791
01:05:24,752 --> 01:05:27,587
I started a story about a cabdriver
who found all that cash...

792
01:05:27,629 --> 01:05:31,925
somebody lost and,
for unknown reasons, wouldn't claim.

793
01:05:32,008 --> 01:05:33,259
Why?.

794
01:05:33,343 --> 01:05:35,929
There's only one kind of money
a guy would be afraid to claim.

795
01:05:36,012 --> 01:05:38,056
I had some idea maybe
there was a connection...

796
01:05:38,139 --> 01:05:40,099
between guns, vigilante groups...

797
01:05:40,141 --> 01:05:43,269
maybe getting ready
for a blowup this summer, you know?.

798
01:05:43,352 --> 01:05:47,356
Then I got sort of sidetracked--
interested, so to speak.

799
01:05:47,439 --> 01:05:49,858
But nobody said anything about this.

800
01:05:49,942 --> 01:05:52,110
My director just told
my union local...

801
01:05:52,152 --> 01:05:55,447
I had taken company film
without authorization.

802
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:57,782
You see,
it gets pretty complicated.

803
01:05:57,824 --> 01:06:00,701
People rarely say
the real reasons for things.

804
01:06:00,785 --> 01:06:02,787
Big corporations never do.

805
01:06:03,871 --> 01:06:05,790
Just politics...

806
01:06:05,873 --> 01:06:09,460
plain bureaucratic politics.

807
01:06:09,543 --> 01:06:12,170
I guess it's the season up here.

808
01:06:12,254 --> 01:06:15,090
Anyway, we only been
in Chicago a little while...

809
01:06:15,173 --> 01:06:17,467
not even long enough
for me to vote.

810
01:06:20,929 --> 01:06:24,473
Come on. Tell me how you managed to
teach five grades in one classroom.

811
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:29,311
I didn't manage.
One thing I did was--

812
01:06:29,395 --> 01:06:31,939
Well, I just had three
in the third grade...

813
01:06:32,022 --> 01:06:34,191
so I put one boy up to fourth...

814
01:06:34,274 --> 01:06:36,359
and a boy and girl back to second.

815
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:38,820
That way I only had four grades.

816
01:06:39,904 --> 01:06:42,448
Is that the new math?.

817
01:07:10,349 --> 01:07:14,895
Gather with the saints at the river

818
01:07:14,979 --> 01:07:19,649
That flows by the throne of God

819
01:07:20,734 --> 01:07:25,655
Shall we gather at the river

820
01:07:25,738 --> 01:07:30,868
Where bright Angel's feet have trod

821
01:07:30,952 --> 01:07:35,748
With these Christians at the river

822
01:07:35,873 --> 01:07:40,210
That flows by the throne of God

823
01:07:41,545 --> 01:07:46,508
Yes, we shall gather at the river

824
01:07:46,591 --> 01:07:51,971
The beautiful, beautiful river

825
01:07:52,054 --> 01:07:56,642
Gather with the saints at the river

826
01:07:56,725 --> 01:08:01,355
That flows by the throne of God

827
01:08:02,397 --> 01:08:07,611
Yes, we shall gather at the river

828
01:08:07,694 --> 01:08:13,157
The beautiful, beautiful river

829
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:17,703
Gather with the saints at the river

830
01:08:17,745 --> 01:08:23,167
That flows by the throne of God

831
01:08:24,001 --> 01:08:27,087
Well, I don 't know
what will happen now.

832
01:08:27,170 --> 01:08:29,881
We've got some difficult
days ahead...

833
01:08:31,132 --> 01:08:33,593
but it doesn 't really matter
with me now...

834
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:35,928
because I've been
to the mountaintop.

835
01:08:37,763 --> 01:08:39,682
I don 't mind.

836
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:47,356
Like anybody,
I would like to live a long life.

837
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:51,193
L ongevity has its place...

838
01:08:51,276 --> 01:08:54,612
but I'm not concerned
about that now.

839
01:08:54,654 --> 01:08:56,990
I just want to do God's will.

840
01:08:58,616 --> 01:09:00,952
And He's allowed me
to go up to the mountain.

841
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:04,121
- Jesus, I love to shoot film.
- And I've looked over...

842
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:07,332
and I've seen...

843
01:09:07,416 --> 01:09:09,793
the promised land.

844
01:09:09,835 --> 01:09:12,420
I may not get there with you...

845
01:09:12,504 --> 01:09:15,256
but I want you to know tonight...

846
01:09:15,298 --> 01:09:17,258
that we, as a people...

847
01:09:17,300 --> 01:09:19,802
will get to the promised land.

848
01:09:22,805 --> 01:09:24,765
Do you feel it?.

849
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:26,767
X rays, is that what it is?.
Does it grow hair?.

850
01:09:26,809 --> 01:09:28,977
Is it vitamins?.

851
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:31,271
Can you feel violence?.

852
01:09:31,313 --> 01:09:33,565
I don't know what to think.

853
01:09:33,648 --> 01:09:37,360
It seems like no man's life
is worth anything anymore.

854
01:09:40,321 --> 01:09:42,448
You see...

855
01:09:42,532 --> 01:09:44,492
the media's got a script now...

856
01:09:44,534 --> 01:09:46,410
by the numbers.

857
01:09:46,494 --> 01:09:49,622
Flags at half-mast.
Trips canceled.

858
01:09:49,663 --> 01:09:51,749
Ball games called off.
Schools closed.

859
01:09:51,832 --> 01:09:53,792
Flags at half-mast.

860
01:09:54,835 --> 01:09:57,254
Memorial meetings.
Memorial marches.

861
01:09:57,337 --> 01:09:59,297
Moments of silence.

862
01:10:00,507 --> 01:10:02,842
A widow cries,
and then she says brave words.

863
01:10:02,884 --> 01:10:04,844
- More moments of silence...
- Standing by...

864
01:10:04,886 --> 01:10:07,638
- in our Washington studio is...
- then the funeral procession.

865
01:10:07,722 --> 01:10:10,850
a foremost expert on urban violence
on the contemporary scene.

866
01:10:10,933 --> 01:10:13,477
A lot of experts...

867
01:10:13,560 --> 01:10:17,147
saying how sick our society is,
how sick we all are.

868
01:10:19,024 --> 01:10:21,526
The script is a national drain-off.

869
01:10:23,111 --> 01:10:27,198
People say, "Yeah, yeah,
we're guilty. We're bad."

870
01:10:27,281 --> 01:10:29,700
'Cause a lot of people are afraid.
They're afraid...

871
01:10:29,784 --> 01:10:33,037
the Negroes are going to tear up
their stores, burn neighborhoods...

872
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,331
so they have this nationwide...

873
01:10:35,414 --> 01:10:39,501
coast-to-coast network special
called "Mourn the Martyr."

874
01:10:39,543 --> 01:10:41,878
Nobody's really
on the hook, you see?.

875
01:10:41,962 --> 01:10:45,298
Traditionally, religion
has supplied the moral backstop.

876
01:10:45,381 --> 01:10:49,427
When the script is finished
and Tuesday comes around...

877
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:52,430
or Saturday and...

878
01:10:52,513 --> 01:10:55,015
National Drain-Off Week is over...

879
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:59,311
everybody goes pretty much
back to normal.

880
01:11:00,395 --> 01:11:02,439
Normal this, normal that.

881
01:11:02,522 --> 01:11:05,317
You know, normal.

882
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:08,528
We will be able
to speed up that day...

883
01:11:08,570 --> 01:11:10,697
when all of God's children--

884
01:11:10,780 --> 01:11:12,865
black men and white men...

885
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:14,867
Jews and gentiles...

886
01:11:14,909 --> 01:11:16,869
Protestants and Catholics--

887
01:11:16,911 --> 01:11:19,038
will be able to join hands...

888
01:11:19,121 --> 01:11:22,666
and sing in the words
of the old Negro spiritual--

889
01:11:22,749 --> 01:11:25,710
Free at last! Free at last!

890
01:11:25,752 --> 01:11:29,214
Thank God Almighty,
we are free at last!

891
01:11:32,342 --> 01:11:34,260
Goose bumps.

892
01:11:35,344 --> 01:11:38,264
It reminds me
of church down home...

893
01:11:38,347 --> 01:11:40,641
sitting there with Clovis...

894
01:11:40,724 --> 01:11:43,727
and Grandma and Buddy.

895
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:47,606
This program,
the third of a series...

896
01:11:47,647 --> 01:11:52,694
was brought to you as
a public service by station WHJP.

897
01:11:52,777 --> 01:11:55,863
Stay tuned for the Late Show
next on Channel 8.

898
01:11:55,947 --> 01:11:58,783
I know your husband can't come
charging through the door.

899
01:11:58,824 --> 01:12:01,785
It'd be too corny,
like the Late Show.

900
01:12:06,290 --> 01:12:07,708
Buddy's dead.

901
01:12:07,791 --> 01:12:11,253
UnitedAirlines says,
"Come fly with me. "

902
01:12:11,294 --> 01:12:13,755
We make it easy for you
to do just that...

903
01:12:13,797 --> 01:12:16,924
with Discover America Fare
for vacation people.

904
01:12:17,008 --> 01:12:20,386
And for young people,
we have a great family plan...

905
01:12:20,469 --> 01:12:22,805
for families of all ages
and all sizes.

906
01:12:22,888 --> 01:12:24,473
- Well...
- So the next time...

907
01:12:24,557 --> 01:12:26,350
you and your family
plan a vacation...

908
01:12:26,433 --> 01:12:29,353
it's raining like hell, and I'm
riding the C.T.A. these days.

909
01:12:29,436 --> 01:12:32,397
- 1 :00's the last one.
- remember to fly...

910
01:12:32,481 --> 01:12:35,817
- the friendly skies of United.
- Well, thanks.

911
01:12:37,235 --> 01:12:40,279
It's 1 1:30 on WHJP.

912
01:12:41,322 --> 01:12:44,116
Harold must have me on his list.

913
01:12:44,158 --> 01:12:47,203
No, you're wrong.

914
01:12:47,286 --> 01:12:50,205
Once he speaks his mind,
he's clear.

915
01:12:56,127 --> 01:12:59,005
Tonight Channel 8 proudly
presents Brigitte Bardot...

916
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:00,632
- Wait!
- and Jack Palance...

917
01:13:00,673 --> 01:13:05,177
in a film by the controversial
French director,Jean-L uc Godard.

918
01:13:05,261 --> 01:13:07,805
In a moment, Contempt.

919
01:13:11,475 --> 01:13:12,893
Here.

920
01:13:15,145 --> 01:13:17,772
Don't want you to get wet.

921
01:13:17,856 --> 01:13:19,441
I won't.

922
01:14:36,262 --> 01:14:38,180
Come on, boy. Listen.

923
01:14:38,264 --> 01:14:39,932
You know...

924
01:14:40,015 --> 01:14:42,809
there's a lot of things that you
don't understand about womenfolks...

925
01:14:42,893 --> 01:14:45,729
I want to talk to you about it,
ya hear?.

926
01:14:47,272 --> 01:14:51,109
A man has got to be boss
of his home.

927
01:14:51,192 --> 01:14:54,278
There ain't no two bosses in
the family because it ain't right.

928
01:14:54,362 --> 01:14:56,280
- You understand that?.
- Yeah.

929
01:14:56,364 --> 01:14:59,408
The thing I'm trying to show you is
that women don't understand a man.

930
01:14:59,450 --> 01:15:01,327
Your home is your castle.

931
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:05,080
I don't care how bad
or where you live or what it is.

932
01:15:05,163 --> 01:15:10,252
That's your castle, and that woman
was made for you and belongs to you.

933
01:15:10,335 --> 01:15:12,295
You don't belong to her,
but she belongs to you.

934
01:15:12,337 --> 01:15:16,382
You twain become one flesh,
and that flesh is you.

935
01:15:16,466 --> 01:15:18,718
She belongs to you, you understand?.

936
01:15:20,636 --> 01:15:24,556
There's a lot of good womenfolks
in the world, don't get me wrong.

937
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:27,643
I mean, the majority of them,
they get high ideas...

938
01:15:28,727 --> 01:15:30,520
Iike they want to go out
on their own.

939
01:15:30,604 --> 01:15:32,981
They want to take over things.

940
01:15:33,064 --> 01:15:35,650
- That's right. Yeah.
- Is that what you mean?.

941
01:15:35,733 --> 01:15:37,819
But don't you never let them, son.

942
01:17:18,745 --> 01:17:20,330
Come here.

943
01:17:22,165 --> 01:17:24,084
- Wow! Somebody made this.
- You see it?.

944
01:17:24,167 --> 01:17:26,294
Yeah, I made it. Look at this.

945
01:17:26,336 --> 01:17:28,671
Wow!

946
01:17:28,713 --> 01:17:31,174
That's a shower. You take
your clothes off over here...

947
01:17:31,257 --> 01:17:33,175
then you jump in there.

948
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:07,624
What'd your daddy do
in West Virginia?.

949
01:18:07,707 --> 01:18:10,543
Coal miner.

950
01:18:10,627 --> 01:18:12,712
Why isn't he coal mining now?.

951
01:18:15,256 --> 01:18:17,842
Coal mine shut down, I reckon.

952
01:18:17,883 --> 01:18:19,969
We moved to Chicago.

953
01:18:20,052 --> 01:18:23,347
He left,
and we ain't seen him since.

954
01:18:24,389 --> 01:18:27,851
Just took off. I don't know.

955
01:18:29,895 --> 01:18:31,855
We'll be good friends, okay?.

956
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:22,318
Bye.

957
01:19:23,945 --> 01:19:26,489
Hey, champ. How you doing?.

958
01:19:30,951 --> 01:19:34,538
You see, the object of this one...

959
01:19:34,621 --> 01:19:37,499
is speed and power...

960
01:19:37,582 --> 01:19:39,000
so...

961
01:19:41,127 --> 01:19:43,254
you work on both.

962
01:19:49,635 --> 01:19:51,220
You see...

963
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:55,390
really, the object is...

964
01:19:55,474 --> 01:19:59,477
to knock the other guy's
brains out, and then you win.

965
01:20:00,645 --> 01:20:03,314
Roll number three, number three.
Sound roll number three.

966
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:07,151
National Democratic Convention,
August 1968.

967
01:20:08,903 --> 01:20:10,863
Hey, how goes my boy,
Johnny the Greek?.

968
01:20:10,946 --> 01:20:13,157
- All ri ght. Good.
- Good, good.

969
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:16,243
You look like you're doing
all right these days.

970
01:20:16,326 --> 01:20:18,453
I saw you in the film
with Norman Mailer.

971
01:20:19,496 --> 01:20:23,458
- What kind of a guy is he?.
- He's out of sight.

972
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:26,210
I mean, Mailer is wild.
He's crazy.

973
01:20:26,294 --> 01:20:30,423
But the thing about Mailer is that
he cuts through the bullshit.

974
01:20:30,506 --> 01:20:33,759
I mean, Mailer is a force.
He's a heavyweight.

975
01:20:33,843 --> 01:20:36,428
Excuse me. May I make up
your room, please?.

976
01:20:37,513 --> 01:20:39,306
Sure.

977
01:20:43,518 --> 01:20:45,603
Listen, you don't have
to start until Thursday.

978
01:20:45,687 --> 01:20:48,982
- Can you get your own equipment?.
- Yeah, sure.

979
01:20:49,023 --> 01:20:51,526
- We shooting EF?.
- Yeah, but not pushed.

980
01:20:51,567 --> 01:20:53,361
Excuse me.
I'll just change the towels...

981
01:20:53,402 --> 01:20:55,362
and then I won't
disturb you anymore.

982
01:21:05,038 --> 01:21:07,040
You seem kind of down,John.

983
01:21:08,124 --> 01:21:10,585
Sometimes up, sometimes down.

984
01:21:11,878 --> 01:21:15,089
Nah, I'm okay.
I'm just anxious to get working.

985
01:21:15,172 --> 01:21:18,551
The photography is not the problem
with this job, baby.

986
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:21,136
This job is keeping up
without being crushed...

987
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:23,722
or having your clothes torn off.

988
01:21:23,805 --> 01:21:26,224
You'll see the day
after tomorrow.

989
01:21:27,767 --> 01:21:29,769
You still see the nurse?.

990
01:21:29,853 --> 01:21:32,730
No, not for some time now.

991
01:21:32,814 --> 01:21:35,566
- What was her name?.
- Ruth.

992
01:21:37,902 --> 01:21:39,487
And her number?.

993
01:21:39,570 --> 01:21:43,115
Testing station two.
One, two, three, four.

994
01:21:44,575 --> 01:21:46,868
Station two is good.

995
01:21:46,910 --> 01:21:48,870
Let's go on to station three.

996
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,957
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Let me see station three.

997
01:21:53,041 --> 01:21:56,627
Station three.
Let me see your light up there.

998
01:21:58,045 --> 01:22:01,340
Let's see your light up there,
station three. That's good.

999
01:22:09,097 --> 01:22:11,766
Let's try station two now.
Station two.

1000
01:22:23,861 --> 01:22:26,905
One, two, three. One, two, three.
Let me see station three.

1001
01:22:26,947 --> 01:22:29,116
Station three.
Let me see your light up there.

1002
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:31,535
I used to come here
for the circus when I was a kid.

1003
01:22:31,618 --> 01:22:33,954
I can still smell it.

1004
01:22:34,037 --> 01:22:35,955
That's the stockyards.

1005
01:22:39,417 --> 01:22:40,918
America is wonderful.

1006
01:22:41,002 --> 01:22:42,962
Wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful, wonderful--

1007
01:22:45,923 --> 01:22:48,634
- It really makes it--
- Free

1008
01:22:52,554 --> 01:22:54,139
Who's that?.

1009
01:22:55,599 --> 01:22:57,309
Oh, wow!

1010
01:22:57,392 --> 01:23:01,062
- Yeah, man.
- What's happening, man?.

1011
01:23:01,145 --> 01:23:05,525
Flashing. Flashing.
Flashing, man.

1012
01:23:05,608 --> 01:23:09,487
- Flashing, man. Crazy, man.
- The sky is blue.

1013
01:23:09,570 --> 01:23:11,488
Out of sight, yeah.

1014
01:23:11,572 --> 01:23:14,199
Listen, are you hung up?.

1015
01:23:16,743 --> 01:23:19,955
- A little strung out, mate?.
- I can't understand.

1016
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:25,209
Out of sight, yeah.
Listen, are you hung up?.

1017
01:23:37,262 --> 01:23:39,014
Hi, boys and girls.
I'm Jimmy Carl Black.

1018
01:23:39,097 --> 01:23:41,016
I'm the Indian of the group.

1019
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:52,777
What's there to live for

1020
01:23:54,486 --> 01:23:57,489
Who needs the Peace Corps

1021
01:24:00,867 --> 01:24:04,454
I'm completely stoned
I'm hippie, and I'm trippy

1022
01:24:04,537 --> 01:24:07,040
And a gypsy on my own

1023
01:24:07,123 --> 01:24:11,085
I'll stay a week and get the grass
and take a bus back home

1024
01:24:11,169 --> 01:24:13,170
I'm really just a phony

1025
01:24:13,254 --> 01:24:15,881
But forgive me 'cause I'm stoned

1026
01:24:20,511 --> 01:24:24,598
Every town must have a place
where phony hippies meet

1027
01:24:24,681 --> 01:24:26,308
Psychedelic dungeons

1028
01:24:26,391 --> 01:24:28,977
Popping up on every street

1029
01:24:29,060 --> 01:24:31,104
Go to

1030
01:24:31,187 --> 01:24:35,566
San Francisco

1031
01:24:37,818 --> 01:24:39,945
How I love ya, how I love ya
How I love ya, how I love ya

1032
01:24:39,987 --> 01:24:42,072
Frisco

1033
01:24:42,156 --> 01:24:44,408
How I love ya, how I love ya
How I love ya, how I love ya

1034
01:24:44,491 --> 01:24:46,618
Oh, my hair is getting
good in the back

1035
01:24:48,536 --> 01:24:52,332
Every town must have a place
where phony hippies meet

1036
01:24:52,415 --> 01:24:54,333
Psychedelic dungeons

1037
01:24:54,417 --> 01:24:56,836
Popping up on every street

1038
01:24:56,919 --> 01:24:59,046
Go to

1039
01:24:59,130 --> 01:25:04,134
San Francisco

1040
01:25:06,136 --> 01:25:08,430
First I'll buy some beads

1041
01:25:08,513 --> 01:25:12,142
And then perhaps a leather band
to go around my head

1042
01:25:12,183 --> 01:25:14,018
Some feathers and bells

1043
01:25:14,102 --> 01:25:16,646
And a book of lndian lore

1044
01:25:18,147 --> 01:25:21,150
I will ask the chamber of commerce
how to get to Haight Street

1045
01:25:21,233 --> 01:25:23,277
And smoke an awful lot of dope

1046
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:26,363
I will wander around barefoot

1047
01:25:26,447 --> 01:25:29,866
I will have a psychedelic gleam
in my eye at all times

1048
01:25:29,950 --> 01:25:32,285
I will love everyone
I will love the police

1049
01:25:32,369 --> 01:25:35,455
As they kick the shit out of me
on the street

1050
01:25:39,000 --> 01:25:42,336
I can't. Harold's in there.
Please don't.

1051
01:26:02,230 --> 01:26:04,190
Don't. Please.

1052
01:28:31,701 --> 01:28:34,204
Harold, you up here?.

1053
01:30:17,507 --> 01:30:20,343
I asked his friends.
I told you...

1054
01:30:20,427 --> 01:30:22,387
I asked everybody
in the whole neighborhood.

1055
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:24,806
I've been up all night long
looking for him.

1056
01:30:24,889 --> 01:30:28,643
Please, please, can't you send
somebody to help me find him?.

1057
01:30:28,726 --> 01:30:31,062
- You people--
- Hello?.

1058
01:30:31,145 --> 01:30:33,189
Look, lady, we can't help.
The city's been invaded.

1059
01:30:33,272 --> 01:30:35,482
I can't spare a man.

1060
01:30:35,566 --> 01:30:37,651
They usually come back, lady.

1061
01:31:41,919 --> 01:31:44,379
Ladies and gentlemen!

1062
01:31:44,463 --> 01:31:47,049
My name is Harold Horton!

1063
01:31:47,132 --> 01:31:49,426
This is Harold Horton!

1064
01:31:52,095 --> 01:31:55,431
Hawaii votes 26 votes yes.

1065
01:31:55,473 --> 01:31:57,433
Idaho, 25.

1066
01:32:00,269 --> 01:32:04,148
Idaho casts 22 1/2 votes yes...

1067
01:32:04,231 --> 01:32:06,150
2 1/2 votes no.

1068
01:32:08,402 --> 01:32:11,279
Iowa passes for the time being.

1069
01:32:11,321 --> 01:32:14,240
Iowa passes. Kansas, 38.

1070
01:32:15,325 --> 01:32:18,745
Kansas casts 38 votes yes.

1071
01:32:23,082 --> 01:32:24,667
Kentucky, 46.

1072
01:33:32,813 --> 01:33:36,191
If you do not leave,
I will order your arrest.

1073
01:33:36,233 --> 01:33:38,193
Leave the park at once.

1074
01:33:46,201 --> 01:33:48,244
Leave the park at once.

1075
01:33:48,327 --> 01:33:50,538
You are in violation of the law.

1076
01:34:37,623 --> 01:34:40,876
Hell, no, we won't go!

1077
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,361
Peace! Now!

1078
01:35:19,078 --> 01:35:21,330
I'm looking for John Katselas.

1079
01:35:22,498 --> 01:35:25,584
Yes. Yes. Where is he?.

1080
01:35:27,127 --> 01:35:29,254
Do you have the phone number?.

1081
01:35:30,547 --> 01:35:33,008
Where is the amphitheater?.

1082
01:35:33,049 --> 01:35:35,301
Peace! Now! Peace! Now!

1083
01:35:49,857 --> 01:35:52,150

Join us! Join us! Join us!

1088

Everybody retreat!

1089
01:36:41,404 --> 01:36:44,949
This way! State Street!
State Street!

1090
01:36:45,033 --> 01:36:47,869
Stay together! Don't panic!

1091
01:36:47,910 --> 01:36:50,037
Let's go!

1092
01:36:50,079 --> 01:36:52,039
Everybody, move out!

1093
01:36:52,748 --> 01:36:55,209
Move it! Move it!
Where's the secondary?.

1094
01:36:55,250 --> 01:36:58,045
Stay together! Stay together!

1095
01:36:58,086 --> 01:37:00,714
We can't get beat
if we stay together!

1096
01:37:00,797 --> 01:37:02,382
Don't panic!

1097
01:37:07,929 --> 01:37:11,265
- Over to the right!
- Sit down!

1098
01:37:11,349 --> 01:37:15,144
Drop down! Get down!

1099
01:37:15,227 --> 01:37:17,688
Back up and sit down!

1100
01:37:23,068 --> 01:37:27,071
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

1101
01:37:41,585 --> 01:37:43,754
All right, you guys, move!

1102
01:37:46,798 --> 01:37:49,717
Remember Prague!
Remember Czechoslovakia!

1103
01:37:49,801 --> 01:37:51,719
Don't forget Budapest!

1104
01:37:54,472 --> 01:37:56,766
Get those cameras out of here!

1105
01:37:56,807 --> 01:37:59,226
NBC, come back!

1106
01:37:59,310 --> 01:38:01,395
Stay with us!

1107
01:38:01,478 --> 01:38:03,730
NBC! Hey! Come back!

1108
01:38:03,814 --> 01:38:05,732
Stay with us!

1109
01:38:06,817 --> 01:38:08,860
All right, people.
Let's keep our cool.

1110
01:38:08,944 --> 01:38:11,613
There's nothing to fear
of these people. Keep our cool.

1111
01:38:19,662 --> 01:38:21,914
Yeah, tanks. It's incredible.

1112
01:38:21,997 --> 01:38:23,916
They're stopping them on 1 8th.

1113
01:38:23,999 --> 01:38:27,169
Reinforce that lock.

1114
01:38:27,294 --> 01:38:29,087
Don't turn your backs to them.

1115
01:38:29,171 --> 01:38:31,089
Watch those two. Just move ahead.

1116
01:38:31,172 --> 01:38:32,841
Move right ahead.

1117
01:38:35,677 --> 01:38:39,347
That's it. Turn left.
Turn right. Turn right.

1118
01:38:39,430 --> 01:38:41,015
Reinforce the single line.

1119
01:38:46,979 --> 01:38:49,189
You are subject to arrest.

1120
01:38:51,566 --> 01:38:53,485
Fuck you, pig!

1121
01:38:55,487 --> 01:38:57,447
You are in violation of the law.

1122
01:38:59,365 --> 01:39:01,242
You are subject to arrest.

1123
01:39:01,284 --> 01:39:04,703
We have information
for the persons among you...

1124
01:39:04,787 --> 01:39:08,165
who may attempt
to injure police officers.

1125
01:39:08,248 --> 01:39:10,209
We will take all
necessary precautions...

1126
01:39:10,292 --> 01:39:12,711
- to protect the policemen.
- Fuck you!

1127
01:39:12,794 --> 01:39:16,214
This is the final warning.
Leave now.

1128
01:39:26,390 --> 01:39:28,601
Look out, Haskell! It's real!

1129
01:39:28,767 --> 01:39:30,602
The mayor of Chicago.

1130
01:41:26,209 --> 01:41:30,755
Everybody gather
in the center of the park.

1131
01:41:37,178 --> 01:41:39,764
Don't struggle with them.
Just hold hands.

1132
01:41:41,432 --> 01:41:42,850
Pigs!

1133
01:41:44,768 --> 01:41:46,728
Get the badge numbers!

1134
01:42:00,866 --> 01:42:03,077
Pigs are whores! Pigs are whores!

1135
01:42:25,473 --> 01:42:27,099
Get up and get off!

1136
01:42:37,525 --> 01:42:40,236
Let's get out of here,
you son of a bitch!

1137
01:42:48,327 --> 01:42:49,745
Move!

1138
01:42:57,210 --> 01:42:59,671
You stinkin' Commies!

1139
01:43:05,301 --> 01:43:06,469
Pigs!

1140
01:43:07,178 --> 01:43:08,804
Go home, pigs!

1141
01:43:08,846 --> 01:43:11,473
Go home, you fuckin' cops!

1142
01:43:15,686 --> 01:43:17,604
Mr. Chairman, Colorado rises...

1143
01:43:17,688 --> 01:43:19,814
to a point of information.

1144
01:43:19,898 --> 01:43:23,026
Is there any rule under which
Mayor Daley can be compelled...

1145
01:43:23,109 --> 01:43:26,654
to suspend the police state terror
perpetrated this minute...

1146
01:43:26,738 --> 01:43:29,574
on kids in front of
the Conrad Hilton?

1147
01:43:31,534 --> 01:43:33,035
The--

1148
01:43:36,038 --> 01:43:37,831
Mr. Chairman.

1149
01:43:37,873 --> 01:43:40,834
The chair must announce...

1150
01:43:42,168 --> 01:43:45,964
that we are calling
the roll of the States...

1151
01:43:46,047 --> 01:43:48,966
and we recognize...

1152
01:43:49,050 --> 01:43:52,845
delegates for no other purpose
than to answer the call.

1153
01:43:52,887 --> 01:43:55,556
Pigs eat shit! Pigs eat shit!

1154
01:43:55,639 --> 01:43:57,808
Pigs are whores! Pigs are whores!

1155
01:43:58,892 --> 01:44:03,855
If you don 't move up on the parkway,
I'll order your arrest.

1156
01:44:03,939 --> 01:44:08,401
Move up on the parkway
or I must order your arrest.

1157
01:44:09,569 --> 01:44:12,321
There isn 't any distinction
anymore for us.

1158
01:44:16,951 --> 01:44:20,454
You go up on the side of the fire
structure, we're gonna get you.

1159
01:44:20,537 --> 01:44:24,499
You come off on our side,
then you get out. You dig?

1160
01:44:24,583 --> 01:44:27,085
I got a message now
from the drop-off community.

1161
01:44:27,168 --> 01:44:29,671
There are people in the streets
all over this country.

1162
01:44:29,754 --> 01:44:32,340
Up against the wall, motherfuckers!

1163
01:44:35,510 --> 01:44:40,973
Will the sergeant at arms
enforce order in the convention?

1164
01:44:41,056 --> 01:44:44,434
The question is on the motion.

1165
01:44:44,518 --> 01:44:46,687
So many as in favor, vote aye.

1166
01:44:46,770 --> 01:44:49,189
- Aye!
- Aye!

1167
01:44:49,272 --> 01:44:51,191
Those opposed, no.
They ayes have it.

1168
01:44:51,274 --> 01:44:53,193
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

1169
01:44:56,779 --> 01:45:00,574
No more war! No more war!

1170
01:45:04,411 --> 01:45:07,331
Join us! Join us! Join us!

1171
01:46:56,014 --> 01:46:57,432
Mama!

1172
01:47:00,268 --> 01:47:01,394
Ma!

1173
01:47:01,436 --> 01:47:03,563
A friend of mine
from El Paso was with me.

1174
01:47:03,605 --> 01:47:06,107
Somebody threw something.
He said, "Did you see that?

1175
01:47:06,191 --> 01:47:08,109
It was a cap or something. "
I said, "No. "

1176
01:47:08,192 --> 01:47:12,571
Some cop says, "What'dyou throw?
What are you doing here?"

1177
01:47:12,613 --> 01:47:15,616
He said, "I'm from El Paso, Texas. "
Then he pushed him into the crowd.

1178
01:47:15,699 --> 01:47:17,284
They're trying to
keep them contained...

1179
01:47:17,368 --> 01:47:18,994
so they can beat them up later.

1180
01:47:19,077 --> 01:47:21,705
- That's right.
- Then this girl passed through--

1181
01:47:21,788 --> 01:47:25,250
The policemen are grabbing
and beating everybody in sight.

1182
01:47:25,292 --> 01:47:29,420
A line of policemen has cut off
the very front of the Hilton.

1183
01:47:30,505 --> 01:47:32,715
- There's mayhem in the streets.
- The victim was identified...

1184
01:47:32,799 --> 01:47:36,135
as former Channel 8 News
cameraman,John Katselas.

1185
01:47:36,177 --> 01:47:38,304
Katselas was taken
to Michael Reese Hospital...

1186
01:47:38,387 --> 01:47:41,098
where he's reported
to be in critical condition.

1187
01:47:41,140 --> 01:47:43,976
Cause of the accident
is under investigation.

1188
01:47:44,017 --> 01:47:47,729
A woman companion, not yet
identified, was dead on arrival.

1189
01:47:47,812 --> 01:47:49,981
People were being clubbed--

1190
01:47:50,064 --> 01:47:52,483
and I mean in Technicolor 3-D--

1191
01:47:52,567 --> 01:47:55,111
and they were crying and screaming.

1192
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,948
I don 't know that
I've seen any blood yet...

1193
01:47:59,031 --> 01:48:01,492
but I've seen
some liquid on the ground.

1194
01:48:02,534 --> 01:48:05,120
People were standing around crying.

1195
01:48:06,997 --> 01:48:10,875
What's your reaction to this girl
with the McCarthy pin?

1196
01:48:10,959 --> 01:48:12,877
I have no comment.

1197
01:48:12,961 --> 01:48:16,339
Girls, girls, boys, people of every
description are being grabbed...

1198
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:18,341
and dragged into paddy wagons.

1199
01:48:18,382 --> 01:48:20,342
What did you say?

1200
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:28,558
And they're chasing people,
particularly people...

1201
01:48:28,642 --> 01:48:31,186
with anarchist flags
or anything like that.

1202
01:48:31,269 --> 01:48:33,897
You can see crowds
running in all directions...

1203
01:48:33,980 --> 01:48:36,858
and plenty of things
are being thrown.

1204
01:48:36,899 --> 01:48:39,068
Police have just grabbed somebody...

1205
01:48:39,152 --> 01:48:41,070
and are beating him over the head.

1206
01:48:41,153 --> 01:48:44,323
The whole crowd across the street
is yelling, "Sieg heil."

1207
01:48:45,699 --> 01:48:48,327
Another melee
is taking place in the park...

1208
01:48:48,410 --> 01:48:50,370
right in front of the nation.

1209
01:48:50,412 --> 01:48:53,290
Right in front of the entire nation,
this is happening.

1210
01:48:53,373 --> 01:48:56,793
NBC- TV is on the roof of
the Haymarket Cocktails/Restaurant--

1211
01:48:56,876 --> 01:48:59,921
part of the Statler Hilton--

1212
01:49:00,004 --> 01:49:03,299
seeing these people being dragged
into the police wagon.

1213
01:49:03,382 --> 01:49:07,219
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

1214
01:49:17,395 --> 01:49:20,523
I'm a successful businessman. I've
been saying, like everybody else...

1215
01:49:20,607 --> 01:49:22,734
"These kids are a bunch of bums. "

1216
01:49:22,817 --> 01:49:24,902
Then I finally found out
when I got down here...

1217
01:49:24,986 --> 01:49:27,738
that, goddamn it,
the kids are right.

1218
01:49:27,780 --> 01:49:30,074
- What made you find out?
- I got gassed.

1219
01:49:30,115 --> 01:49:32,076
I came down here, and I got gassed.

1220
01:49:32,117 --> 01:49:35,120
And you kids, go, man, go!

1221
01:49:35,203 --> 01:49:37,372
The police just grabbed somebody...

1222
01:49:37,455 --> 01:49:39,416
and are beating him over the head...

1223
01:49:39,457 --> 01:49:41,417
and are trying to throw him...

1224
01:49:41,459 --> 01:49:43,544
into the paddy wagon.

1225
01:49:43,586 --> 01:49:46,714
A scoop, made of police, simply...

1226
01:49:46,756 --> 01:49:50,384
flies out and-- flies out--

1227
01:49:50,468 --> 01:49:51,802
Move! Move!

1228
01:49:51,886 --> 01:49:53,804
I'm being made to move.

1229
01:49:53,887 --> 01:49:56,473
The cameraman, everybody's
being made to move now.

1230
01:49:56,556 --> 01:49:59,059
Move! Move! Everybody move!

1231
01:49:59,142 --> 01:50:00,894
We're being thrown up
against the wall.

1232
01:50:00,936 --> 01:50:02,520
Let's go!

1233
01:50:02,604 --> 01:50:05,273
I just got out of being
smashed against the wall...

1234
01:50:05,356 --> 01:50:07,483
by the skin of my teeth...

1235
01:50:07,567 --> 01:50:10,611
by showing my press badge
to a kindly policeman.

1236
01:50:10,695 --> 01:50:13,739
People are being smashed up
against the wall...

1237
01:50:13,822 --> 01:50:15,449
and are being hit...

1238
01:50:15,532 --> 01:50:17,784
by the police with their clubs.

1239
01:50:17,868 --> 01:50:20,037
And those are real night sticks...

1240
01:50:20,120 --> 01:50:22,247
and people are really being hit.

1241
