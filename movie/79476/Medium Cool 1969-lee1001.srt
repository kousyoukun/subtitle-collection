1
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:31,774
Better call an ambulance.

2
00:01:42,536 --> 00:01:46,080
- 5251, Chicago.
<i>- 5251.</i>

3
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:48,499
Better send an ambulance
out to the Eisenhower...

4
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:50,668
in front of the Kedzie turnoff.

5
00:01:50,794 --> 00:01:54,589
We got a wreck. We got coverage.
We'll send it in with the bike man.

6
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,424
<i>Ten-four.</i>

7
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:58,259
Okay.

8
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,553
<i>5251, clear.</i>

9
00:04:11,935 --> 00:04:15,771
That's his public posture,
but he's the one who's right there...

10
00:04:15,898 --> 00:04:19,692
with his eyes glued to the screen
when the blood starts running.

11
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:23,070
And he's the one who says,
"Ooh, isn't it horrible?

12
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:25,323
Ooh, isn't it horrible?
Let me see some more."

13
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,825
But a lot of people buy
<i>The New York Times.</i>

14
00:04:27,951 --> 00:04:31,162
What I mean to say
is that it happens —

15
00:04:31,288 --> 00:04:33,539
it has happened always...

16
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:38,044
whether it was a photographer
or a journalist or a cameraman.

17
00:04:38,212 --> 00:04:41,589
When you are in the middle
of something happening, you —

18
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43,841
It is a risk of the profession.

19
00:04:43,967 --> 00:04:47,887
What's the difference between a person
who types something and a typewriter?

20
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:51,933
The typewriter doesn't really care
what's being typed on it.

21
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:55,561
<i>But a typewriter's a machine,</i>
<i>and you're not a machine.</i>

22
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:57,104
Uh —

23
00:04:57,231 --> 00:05:00,758
Actually, I'm kind of an elongation
of a tape recorder.

24
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:05,529
I'll tell you something else: I've made
films on all kinds of social problems...

25
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:08,074
and the big bombs were the ones
where we went into detail...

26
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,076
and showed
why something happened.

27
00:05:10,244 --> 00:05:12,203
Nobody wants to take the time.

28
00:05:12,329 --> 00:05:14,455
They'd rather see 30 seconds
of somebody getting his skull cracked...

29
00:05:14,581 --> 00:05:17,250
turn off the TV, and say,
"Let me have another beer."

30
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:19,627
But Hollywood, the news med—

31
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:23,798
Well, our position
is one to, uh, to record.

32
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:26,050
The dynamics happening
in society —

33
00:05:26,176 --> 00:05:28,094
We don't deal
with the static things.

34
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,514
We deal with the things
that are happening, with the violence.

35
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,184
Who wants to see somebody sitting,
somebody lying down...

36
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,062
somebody talking peace —
unless they're talking loud?

37
00:05:38,188 --> 00:05:41,023
- I think the cameraman
makes the choice himself.
- No, ma'am.

38
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:44,610
He's out there to get the blood
and guts. Yes, I believe that.

39
00:05:44,736 --> 00:05:47,488
The other night on television,
there was a fellow in the ghetto.

40
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:50,574
If there's something else that is nice,
that could fill the news...

41
00:05:50,701 --> 00:05:54,578
he'll take the stabbings, even if
he's had 27 minutes of stabbing before.

42
00:05:54,705 --> 00:05:57,623
They're someplace safe,
away from it. They deplore it...

43
00:05:57,791 --> 00:06:00,084
but they deplore it
like all good people.

44
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,962
All good people deplore
problems at a distance.

45
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:06,299
Like Thomas Jefferson — he loved
the common man, but at a distance.

46
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:08,009
This is exactly what happened.

47
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:10,970
Five cameramen have been killed,
one in Germany.

48
00:06:11,096 --> 00:06:13,139
He was beat to death by a mob —

49
00:06:13,307 --> 00:06:15,641
just literally
stone beat to death — for UPI.

50
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:17,727
Know what the excuse was?

51
00:06:17,853 --> 00:06:19,937
The crowd thought
he was taking pictures for the police.

52
00:06:20,063 --> 00:06:23,316
They had a couple of fellas
in a civil rights protest...

53
00:06:23,442 --> 00:06:26,152
that were chained together,
and I was taking pictures.

54
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,612
The cops said, "Don't you think
you'd better load the camera?"

55
00:06:28,739 --> 00:06:30,865
I says, "I'm not out of film."
They say, "Load it anyway.

56
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,743
We want to move these guys."
And he starts pushing the lens.

57
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:37,663
I says, "Next time you push me,
I'll fall down and start crying,"
and he walked away.

58
00:06:37,789 --> 00:06:41,083
...the 120 Angenieux lens,
and yanking back and forth...

59
00:06:41,209 --> 00:06:45,171
yelling "black power" at me,
and I'm just shaking to death...

60
00:06:45,297 --> 00:06:47,715
with a $1,200 lens
on the camera.

61
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:50,801
So here I am in the middle,
and I got no place to hide...

62
00:06:50,927 --> 00:06:54,889
'cause I'm carrying a 40-pound camera,
trying to get pictures.

63
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:57,141
And so the rioter
wants to beat me up.

64
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,727
He thinks I'm trying
to identify him for the police.

65
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:02,813
The policeman wants
to elbow me out of the way...

66
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:06,192
and I'm being gentle because
he doesn't want the sergeant to see...

67
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,862
he picked up some guy
and threw him in the backseat of a car.

68
00:07:09,988 --> 00:07:12,448
And the editor, who says,
"Hey, I want the pictures...

69
00:07:12,574 --> 00:07:15,534
because my audience
doesn't care what brought this on."

70
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,537
You need the money
to feed your family.

71
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:21,582
If you don't bring them back,
you're not going to have a job?

72
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:25,169
Forget that. I've got a job to do,
and I'm interested in it...

73
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:27,380
but the point
I resent very much...

74
00:07:27,506 --> 00:07:30,383
is the fact that wherever I go,
I'm beat up.

75
00:07:32,052 --> 00:07:34,428
- Shoot into those troops!
<i>- Shoot 'em!</i>

76
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,390
<i>Shoot the shit out of 'em!</i>
<i>Get 'em!</i>

77
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:39,183
<i>Hey, you guys are shot!</i>

78
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:40,893
What kind of country is this?
What's wrong?

79
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:45,106
We're people! Why are you having
soldiers here with bayonets?

80
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,611
Hey, we got a chaplain.
Hold on.

81
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:03,165
<i>That was an unprovoked attack.</i>
<i>That was retaliatory.</i>

82
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:06,377
<i>- Kill 'em!</i>
<i>- Not me, not me.</i>

83
00:08:06,503 --> 00:08:08,796
<i>This man has an obsolete weapon.</i>

84
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:12,383
Make love, not war.

85
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:15,594
They stabbed one of our guys
right in the belly.

86
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:18,973
I am Brigadier General
Richard T. Dunn...

87
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:22,643
commanding general of the
Emergency Operation Headquarters...

88
00:08:22,769 --> 00:08:25,479
of the Illinois Army
National Guard.

89
00:08:25,605 --> 00:08:27,940
<i>The Emergency Operation</i>
<i>Headquarters...</i>

90
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:31,652
<i>is one which was</i>
<i>established last winter...</i>

91
00:08:31,778 --> 00:08:35,448
<i>for the purpose of planning</i>
<i>and controlling operations...</i>

92
00:08:35,574 --> 00:08:38,659
<i>in the event of civil disturbances.</i>

93
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:40,453
<i>Over.</i>

94
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:43,205
Out in the street,
their bayonets are fixed...

95
00:08:43,331 --> 00:08:47,668
and, uh, they know it's for real
in a real riot in the city.

96
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:50,212
And here we know
it's more or less —

97
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:52,214
<i>It's a war game, more or less.</i>

98
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:55,968
<i>- How's it going so far?</i>
<i>- That I couldn't tell you.</i>
<i>I'm the enemy.</i>

99
00:08:58,138 --> 00:08:59,847
We love you guys.

100
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,683
<i>We have women for you. Beer.</i>

101
00:09:02,809 --> 00:09:04,922
<i>Come on!</i>

102
00:09:05,228 --> 00:09:09,273
- Sing it, now.
- # Glory, glory, hallelujah #

103
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:16,947
# Glory, glory, hallelujah #

104
00:09:17,073 --> 00:09:21,410
# His truth is marching on #

105
00:09:21,536 --> 00:09:23,996
- When do we want freedom?
- Now!

106
00:09:24,164 --> 00:09:26,832
<i>- When do we want equality?</i>
<i>- Now!</i>

107
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,460
<i>- When are we gonna get it?</i>
<i>- Now!</i>

108
00:09:29,586 --> 00:09:33,088
It is what our forefathers fought for —
the free choice of people!

109
00:09:33,215 --> 00:09:34,999
Yeah!

110
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:39,345
<i>But this country is changing.</i>
<i>It is no longer for all the people.</i>

111
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:42,890
<i>- It is for some of the people.</i>
- Yeah!

112
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:46,268
<i>- We see a war we do not want.</i>
- Yeah!

113
00:09:46,394 --> 00:09:50,064
- We see an apathy
towards love and brotherhood.
<i>- Yeah!</i>

114
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,484
<i>- Bring out the mayor.</i>
<i>- Bring out the mayor.</i>

115
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,819
<i>Hold on! Hold on!</i>

116
00:09:55,946 --> 00:10:00,908
We want the mayor!
We want the mayor!

117
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:04,078
We want the mayor!
We want the mayor!

118
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,704
We want the mayor!

119
00:10:05,872 --> 00:10:08,707
<i>We'll bring the judge out
to talk to you.</i>

120
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,877
<i>We want the mayor!</i>
<i>We don't want a flunky!</i>

121
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:15,923
<i>We want the mayor!</i>
<i>We want the mayor!</i>

122
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,635
<i>My friends,</i>
<i>I've stood before you many times.</i>

123
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:21,303
Tell it to 'em, Mayor!

124
00:10:21,429 --> 00:10:26,058
<i>You elected me mayor of this town</i>
<i>for the last 20 years.</i>

125
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:29,645
<i>- No, we didn't!</i>
<i>- Tell it to 'em!</i>

126
00:10:29,771 --> 00:10:33,957
<i>We've given you everything</i>
<i>that we thought you needed.</i>

127
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:40,239
<i>I've let you use our swimming pool</i>
<i>every Fourth of July.</i>

128
00:10:41,783 --> 00:10:45,327
<i>- We want it every day of the year!</i>
<i>- We've operated —</i>

129
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:49,164
<i>We've operated the liquor store</i>
<i>with a minimum of profit.</i>

130
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,959
<i>Sock it to him, baby!</i>
<i>Sock it to him!</i>

131
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:56,605
<i>I understand</i>
<i>that you have some problems.</i>

132
00:10:59,092 --> 00:11:03,437
<i>- You have avoided our problems!</i>
<i>- I understand that you have —</i>

133
00:11:05,307 --> 00:11:08,851
<i>I understand that you have</i>
<i>some complaints.</i>

134
00:11:08,977 --> 00:11:13,147
<i>We shall overcome.</i>
<i>We shall overcome.</i>

135
00:11:13,273 --> 00:11:17,484
<i># We shall overcome #</i>

136
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:22,281
<i># We shall overcome #</i>

137
00:11:22,407 --> 00:11:26,452
<i># We shall overcome #</i>

138
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:30,623
<i># Someday ##</i>

139
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:02,279
<i>Let's get the guys with the cameras!</i>

140
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:16,126
<i>Four, three, two, one.</i>

141
00:12:16,252 --> 00:12:19,713
<i>Fade in. Richard starts back.</i>

142
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,301
<i>And cue announce.</i>
<i>Keep on coming, but don't look at me.</i>

143
00:12:24,427 --> 00:12:28,305
<i>- And hold.</i>
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

144
00:12:28,431 --> 00:12:31,684
<i>Now, down and in, slowly.</i>

145
00:12:31,851 --> 00:12:33,769
<i>Very slowly.</i>

146
00:12:35,689 --> 00:12:37,856
<i>You riding iris on this, Jerry?</i>

147
00:12:40,568 --> 00:12:42,820
<i>Slate on one.</i>
<i>Stand by to take.</i>

148

00:26:46,205 --> 00:26:48,206
Look at these guys.

298
00:26:50,459 --> 00:26:53,127
<i>Couple of hours,</i>
<i>they're all set up.</i>

299
00:26:57,716 --> 00:27:00,468
<i>Twenty, 25 camera positions —</i>
<i>like nothing.</i>

300
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:07,892
They've had experience
since we did JFK in '63.

301
00:27:32,334 --> 00:27:34,127
Hello, ladies.

302
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:48,099
<i>What are your plans</i>
<i>for the summer —</i>

303
00:27:48,225 --> 00:27:50,977
<i>this, which will be</i>
<i>a very political summer...</i>

304
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,770
<i>and possibly a very hot one?</i>

305
00:27:52,896 --> 00:27:55,982
Oh, well, now,
let's not get into politics.

306
00:27:56,108 --> 00:28:00,445
Well, uh, we, um,
always go up to our place...

307
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:03,072
up in Ontario...

308
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:05,116
up in Canada...

309
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:07,493
a place called Desbarats.

310
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,954
That's D-E-S. It's French.

311
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,123
It's not like the girl's name.

312
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:15,418
And about this time of year
we always start looking forward...

313
00:28:15,544 --> 00:28:17,545
to getting away from the city...

314
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:20,465
and the crowds and the heat and —

315
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:23,509
It's very primitive up there.

316
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:27,221
I think sometimes it's, uh —
it's good for the soul...

317
00:28:27,348 --> 00:28:29,474
don't you,
to get away from civilization...

318
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,392
don't you think so?

319
00:28:54,416 --> 00:28:56,793
- Hello.
- Hello.

320
00:28:56,919 --> 00:28:58,753
<i>Is your mother home?</i>

321
00:28:58,879 --> 00:29:00,672
Yes. No.

322
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,549
<i>- No? Is she working?</i>
- Yes.

323
00:29:03,676 --> 00:29:05,802
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
<i>What time will she be home?</i>

324
00:29:07,304 --> 00:29:10,056
- At 12:00.
<i>- I see.</i>

325
00:29:10,182 --> 00:29:13,768
<i>- Now, how long have you lived here?</i>
- I don't know.

326
00:29:13,894 --> 00:29:15,603
<i>- You don't know?</i>
- No.

327
00:29:15,729 --> 00:29:18,606
<i>Could you tell me where you lived</i>
<i>before you moved here?</i>

328
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:20,775
- Yes.
<i>- Uh-huh. Where?</i>

329
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:23,027
- At West Virginia.
<i>- I see.</i>

330
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,321
<i>In West Virginia. Mm-hmm.</i>

331
00:29:25,447 --> 00:29:27,824
<i>Now, how many rooms</i>
<i>do you have?</i>

332
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:30,493
- No — Yeah, four.
<i>- Four rooms. Mm-hmm.</i>

333
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,787
<i>- Do you have a TV set?</i>
- Yes.

334
00:29:32,913 --> 00:29:35,665
<i>- You do. Do you have a stereo?</i>
- Yes.

335
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:38,292
<i>And how many brothers</i>
<i>and sisters do you have?</i>

336
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,171
- None.
<i>- None? You're the only child, hmm?</i>

337
00:29:42,297 --> 00:29:45,508
- Yes.
<i>- Mm-hmm. And how old are you?</i>

338
00:29:45,634 --> 00:29:47,552
- Thirteen.
<i>- Thirteen. Teally?</i>

339
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,096
<i>- And do you go to church?</i>
- Yes.

340
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:54,100
<i>That's a good boy.</i>
<i>Now, what is your father's name?</i>

341
00:29:54,226 --> 00:29:55,810
Buddy.

342
00:29:55,936 --> 00:29:57,437
<i>- What?</i>
- Buddy.

343
00:29:57,563 --> 00:30:00,982
<i>- Buddy. Does he live</i>
<i>here at home with you?</i>
- No.

344
00:30:01,108 --> 00:30:03,484
<i>Could you tell me</i>
<i>where I could find him?</i>

345
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:07,488
At Vietnam.

346
00:30:08,657 --> 00:30:11,993
Let's go see
what damage we done up here.

347
00:30:17,624 --> 00:30:20,793
- Look at the holes in it.
- Golly!

348
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,921
Look around and see
if you can find another.

349
00:30:26,216 --> 00:30:28,926
Hell, I got something here.
Come here.

350
00:30:29,052 --> 00:30:31,596
I ain't gonna waste this, though.

351
00:30:31,722 --> 00:30:33,431
Gonna drink this.

352
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,483
Come on.

353
00:30:46,737 --> 00:30:48,946
<i>- Do you want to shoot it?</i>
- Huh-uh.

354
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:52,950
- It ain't gonna hurt you.
Just put a shell in it like that.
- I don't want to shoot it.

355
00:30:53,076 --> 00:30:56,829
It's safe. It won't hurt you at all.
Draw it back.

356
00:30:58,874 --> 00:31:02,543
Knock it off of there.
That's all you gotta do.

357
00:31:02,669 --> 00:31:04,587
Come on. Let's go.

358
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,257
Come on.
Let's go look at the pigeons.

359
00:32:08,527 --> 00:32:10,528
Nothing's missing. I looked.

360
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:18,035
You out of shape, pal?

361
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,705
What's in the basket?

362
00:32:22,457 --> 00:32:24,041
Dinner.

363
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,479
<i>Why don't you admit it?</i>

364
00:32:45,606 --> 00:32:47,315
<i>Go on. Just say it.</i>

365
00:32:47,441 --> 00:32:49,400
You're a bastard.

366
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:55,072
Admit it to me.

367
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,158
Admit it to yourself.

368
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:01,662
You're a —
a rotten, egotistical...

369
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:03,456
selfish...

370
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:07,710
punchy cameraman.

371
00:33:14,134 --> 00:33:15,635
Well?

372
00:33:18,931 --> 00:33:20,598
Well? Well?

373
00:33:20,766 --> 00:33:23,309
Well? Well? Well?

374
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:28,356
Look at this here. Look.

375
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:32,151
How do you like it?
Gus wired it up for me.

376
00:33:32,277 --> 00:33:36,781
<i>Look back there.</i>
<i>Fiber optics. Great, huh?</i>

377
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:40,409
<i>See the TV? Lights.</i>

378
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:43,329
<i>- Look at that.</i>
<i>- John.</i>

379
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:45,164
Hmm?

380
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,792
Do you remember
when we saw <i>Mondo Cane</i>?

381
00:33:48,835 --> 00:33:52,630
- We didn't see <i>Mondo Cane</i>,
- Well, I saw it.

382
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:56,258
I saw it too, but I don't
remember seeing it with you.

383
00:33:57,469 --> 00:33:59,971
Well, anyway,
that's not the point.

384
00:34:00,097 --> 00:34:01,847
What's the point?

385
00:34:03,308 --> 00:34:05,810
Well, you remember that scene...

386
00:34:05,936 --> 00:34:08,604
on an island,
where they tested an atom bomb?

387
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:10,398
Yeah.

388
00:34:10,524 --> 00:34:13,859
Well, there were these big turtles —

389
00:34:13,986 --> 00:34:16,237
you know, tortoises —

390
00:34:16,363 --> 00:34:18,489
who, at a certain time
in their lives...

391
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,701
would walk to the sea
to lay their eggs.

392
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:24,328
And they found
that the radiation thing...

393
00:34:24,454 --> 00:34:26,497
threw the turtles'
sense of directions...

394
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,501
so instead of heading to the sea,
they went inland, and they died.

395
00:34:30,627 --> 00:34:32,461
Oh, I'm crying.

396
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,425
Damn it!

397
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:40,469
Look, somebody
took those movies, right?

398
00:34:40,595 --> 00:34:43,514
I mean, do you think —
did they or didn't they...

399
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:45,766
after they took those movies...

400
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:50,813
do you think — did they reach down
and turn those turtles around?

401
00:34:50,939 --> 00:34:54,483
<i>Or did they put them in a jeep</i>
<i>and drive them back?</i>

402
00:34:54,609 --> 00:34:58,112
How the hell do I know what they did?
Those were Italian cameramen.

403
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:04,577
I give up. I surrender.

404
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:12,334
Hey, no calories.

405
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:16,088
I'd rather keep
my kidneys for a while.

406
00:35:25,974 --> 00:35:29,810
"Research physicians at the Istituto
del Salvator Mundi in Rome...

407
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:32,021
<i>revealed today</i>
<i>the results of tests...</i>

408

<i>involving a new device</i>

<i>during the entire course</i>
<i>of their pregnancy.</i>

410
00:35:37,277 --> 00:35:40,404
<i>This device consists</i>
<i>of a steel-and-plastic cylinder...</i>

411
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,449
<i>which can be controlled</i>
<i>so as to create a partial vacuum...</i>

<i>14.7 pounds per square inch...</i>

419

420

in the early stages

421
00:36:13,438 --> 00:36:17,983
will be prohibititive —

No! Give me my sheet back!
John!

426
00:36:41,508 --> 00:36:43,801
Oh!
Give me that!

427
00:36:48,974 --> 00:36:51,475
I got you!

Son of a bitch!

00:36:58,984 --> 00:37:01,569
No! Help!
No, not on the floor!

431
00:37:01,695 --> 00:37:03,663
Jesus, you —

432
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,490
Help! Put me down!
Put me down! Help!

<i> Ooh! Naughty, naughty.</i>
<i>I got neighbors. Come on.</i>

436
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:17,126
- Son of a bitch!
- I got neighbors. Be quiet.

437
00:37:17,252 --> 00:37:18,836
Kick you in the ass!

438
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:21,922
I'll bust your arms.
I like you!

439
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,966
Give me a kiss.

440

There he goes.

00:37:43,612 --> 00:37:45,487
One good deed a year.

444
00:37:45,614 --> 00:37:47,364
I heard that.

445
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:19,498
- You dropped your newspaper.
- Who are you?

446
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:23,252
"Horton"?
"4444 North Clifton"?

447
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:26,046
I think this belongs
to your little brother.

448
00:39:26,172 --> 00:39:28,841
I don't have a brother.
It belongs to my son.

449
00:39:31,219 --> 00:39:33,762
Mr. Horton go for green beans?

450
00:39:41,062 --> 00:39:44,148
Hey, hey, come on. Not on the car.

451
00:39:44,274 --> 00:39:47,359
- Move it, man.
- Not on the car.

452
00:39:47,485 --> 00:39:50,154
Not on the car.
Come on. Get off the car.

453
00:39:50,322 --> 00:39:52,698
Come on. Off the car.

454
00:39:52,824 --> 00:39:54,992
Come on. Hey —

455
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:57,036
Hey, get out of there.

456
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:07,546
Hey, come on.
Out of the car.

457
00:40:07,672 --> 00:40:09,923
This is an official car.
Come on.

458
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:15,512
- All those kids out there yours?
- No. They belong to my neighbors.

459
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,724
- Hey, you're from the mountains.
- West Virginia.

460
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,143
- Just spent three weeks there.
- You did?

461
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:25,647
"We sure
starve a lot when the stamps run out.

462
00:40:25,774 --> 00:40:29,943
Trouble is, you can't get
no 'tobaccy' on stamps."

463
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:33,405
<i>- So you know about the stamps.</i>
- No, not really.

464
00:40:33,531 --> 00:40:36,200
I did this documentary.
Those words are on a tape.

465
00:40:52,592 --> 00:40:54,968
Hello, Marian?
This is Gus.

466
00:40:55,095 --> 00:40:58,389
Page Katselas on number 512.

467
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:01,141
Have him report
to the wagon immediately.

468
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,768
<i>Ten-four.</i>

469
00:41:02,894 --> 00:41:05,646
I could've let the bird go
and he would've flown back...

470
00:41:05,772 --> 00:41:08,357
but I don't know
how he would've carried the basket.

471
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:11,068
Well, it might've flown back
to West Virginia.

472
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:13,570
Harold spends all his time
trying to retrain him.

473
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,115
- How long you been up here?
- Not too long.

474
00:41:19,994 --> 00:41:23,789
<i>- Katselas, call the office.</i>
- You got a telephone around here?

475
00:41:23,915 --> 00:41:25,582
In the hall.

476
00:41:39,764 --> 00:41:41,598
Katselas here.

477
00:41:43,101 --> 00:41:45,853
Yeah, but he's right outsi—

478
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:48,439
He did, huh?

479
00:41:48,565 --> 00:41:51,442
Yeah, all right.
Anything else?

480
00:41:51,609 --> 00:41:53,527
All right. Thank you.

481
00:41:59,117 --> 00:42:00,826
You tell Harold...

482
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:03,996
the bad guy from the parking lot
brought his bird back.

483
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:09,126
<i>- You tell him, hear?</i>
- I will.

484
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:21,722
Would you mind shutting this off?

485
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:24,975
We're gonna make sound here.
Would you shut this off?

486
00:42:25,143 --> 00:42:26,977
- Shut it off!
- All right.

487
00:42:27,145 --> 00:42:29,104
- Hey, Gus!
- I'll shut it off.

488
00:42:30,482 --> 00:42:33,442
Where was the money at?
Where was it really located?

489
00:42:33,568 --> 00:42:35,486
Was it stuffed in the seat?

490
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,030
It was in an envelope
on the floor of the cab.

491
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:39,990
What kind of envelope?

492
00:42:41,993 --> 00:42:44,119
What kind
of an envelope was it?

493
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:46,330
Ask him.
He's counting the money there.

494
00:42:46,498 --> 00:42:49,500
He's counting the money.
How much money is it?

495
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:52,002
- How much money was it?
- No, don't ask him.

496
00:42:52,128 --> 00:42:54,963
I want to know from you.
How much money did you have?

497
00:42:55,089 --> 00:42:57,591
How much did you count?
Did you count the money?

498
00:42:57,717 --> 00:43:00,511
- $10,000.
- You sure it was $10,000?

499
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,222
Wasn't 9,000?
Wasn't 11,000?

500
00:43:03,348 --> 00:43:06,099
9,000? $10,000, right?

501
00:43:06,226 --> 00:43:09,895
Yeah, it was 9,000.
I put a thousand of mine to make it 10.

502
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:12,022
What, you gonna
get funny now?

503
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,150
Gonna start putting me on?
Let's not play games.

504
00:43:15,276 --> 00:43:20,155
I'm here to find out why you turned in
$10,000. Where did you get it?

505
00:43:20,281 --> 00:43:23,867
<i>Aren't you thankful</i>
<i>that I did turn in $10,000?</i>

506
00:43:24,035 --> 00:43:27,204
<i>Maybe not. I'm a policeman.</i>
<i>I'm just here to find out the facts.</i>

507
00:44:21,134 --> 00:44:25,887
Just tell her we cover the news.
We do not manufacture violence.

508
00:44:26,014 --> 00:44:28,098
Talk to her, okay?

509
00:44:29,684 --> 00:44:31,727
Mrs. Harris, I'm re—

510
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:34,021
Well?

511
00:44:34,147 --> 00:44:36,690
Remember the shot of the cabby
who turned the money in?

512
00:44:36,816 --> 00:44:39,401
- Forget it.
- There's a story there, Carlin.

513
00:44:39,527 --> 00:44:41,278
It's worth following up.
People are interested.

514
00:44:41,404 --> 00:44:43,322
- No.
- I think it'll go on the Sunday reports.

515
00:44:43,448 --> 00:44:46,408
No, I got a convention coming up,
plus I got a war...

516
00:44:46,534 --> 00:44:49,578
plus I got baseball,
plus I got a nervous city...

517
00:44:49,704 --> 00:44:52,372
plus I got chickenshit cameramen
that are afraid...

518
00:44:52,498 --> 00:44:54,791
to go into the ghetto
without police protection.

519
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,585
No. N-O.

520
00:44:56,711 --> 00:44:58,920
You stay out
of those neighborhoods...

521
00:44:59,047 --> 00:45:01,590
<i>- until I send you in there.</i>
- I want film and lab.

522
00:45:01,716 --> 00:45:04,593
- Look, they got film.
- I want film and lab.

523
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,512
Look, my friend, would you
please stop bothering me?

524
00:45:07,639 --> 00:45:11,016
<i>Mr. Evans's office on line six,
Mr. Carlin.</i>

525
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:15,395
Write up a voucher.
Yes, sir. Good morning.

526
00:45:15,521 --> 00:45:19,316
Hey, TV man.
Are we gonna be on TV?

527
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:23,528
We gonna get on TV.

528
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:26,448
Hey, TV man!
What's happening, man?

529
00:45:26,574 --> 00:45:30,369
<i>Cards slaughtered Philadelphia, 9-0.</i>

530
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,789
<i>Then, finally, it was the Mets</i>
<i>walloping the Pirates.</i>

531
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:39,670
- Locked?
- Yeah.

532
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,048
You know you're
two blocks away, don't you?

533
00:45:43,174 --> 00:45:47,052
I had some trouble in there last night.
Thought we'd keep the equipment safe.

534
00:45:50,098 --> 00:45:52,474
White bread on a sandwich
is not too cool.

535
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,229
<i>- Come on, now.</i>
- No. That's out of it. O-U-T. Out.

536
00:45:57,355 --> 00:46:00,774
I don't think we have any other kind,
but I'll take a look-see here.

537
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,693
- Uh, Frank.
- Uh-huh?

538
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,195
I dug your name in the paper.
What's happening?

539
00:46:05,363 --> 00:46:09,282
You're somewhat of a celebrity now,
aren't you? Want to fill me in?

540
00:46:09,409 --> 00:46:13,203
Well, not really a celebrity,
but yeah, you know...

541
00:46:13,371 --> 00:46:16,206
I, uh — I found the bread,
and I turned it in.

542
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,999
- You turned it in?
- Uh-huh.

543
00:46:18,126 --> 00:46:21,211
Now, were you acting
as a Negro or as a black man?

544
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:23,422
How do you feel?
I'm concerned about this.

545
00:46:23,548 --> 00:46:25,173
What do you mean?

546
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:29,177
Because I feel if you were acting as
a black man, you would've kept the money.

547
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:33,014
<i>If you acting as a Negro,</i>
<i>you turned it in.</i>

548
00:46:33,141 --> 00:46:36,643
You're my man.
You're my man and everything.

549
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:40,021
- Frank, how much money was that?
- $10,000.

550
00:46:40,148 --> 00:46:42,691
$10,000? You kidding?

551
00:46:42,817 --> 00:46:45,527
<i>Dig, dig. Now, look.</i>
<i>Now, you know...</i>

552
00:46:45,653 --> 00:46:47,404
do you realize...

553
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:49,906
how much
ammunition and guns...

554
00:46:50,074 --> 00:46:52,075
$10,000 would've bought?

555
00:46:53,411 --> 00:46:55,579
Well, I'm not quite there yet,
you know?

556
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:59,499
But I'm talking about, baby,
you got to be alive to be honest.

557
00:47:00,585 --> 00:47:03,920
- What you doing around here, man?
- Just buying some cigarettes.

558
00:47:04,046 --> 00:47:07,591
You ain't got no right coming here
to buy no cigarettes.

559
00:47:07,759 --> 00:47:10,093
Huh?

560
00:47:10,261 --> 00:47:12,721
Guys like you get shot all up,
you know?

561
00:47:14,348 --> 00:47:17,726
- Let's go, Gus.
- Don't come around here for no cigarettes.

562
00:47:17,852 --> 00:47:19,770
You know what I mean?

563
00:48:02,146 --> 00:48:03,980
We have a visitor.

564
00:48:06,359 --> 00:48:09,361
- Frank Baker live here?
- "Frank Baker live here?"

565
00:48:09,487 --> 00:48:12,781
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?
- "Frank Baker, cabdriver?"

566
00:48:12,907 --> 00:48:15,408
- Does he live here?
- Does he <i>live</i> here?

567
00:48:15,535 --> 00:48:17,369
Yeah. Does he live here?

568
00:48:17,495 --> 00:48:19,204
Does he live here?

569
00:48:19,330 --> 00:48:21,623
<i>There's no Frank Cabdriver here.</i>

570
00:48:23,417 --> 00:48:26,253
You don't know him?
He's a cabdriver.

571
00:48:26,379 --> 00:48:29,464
I did a story on him.
I'm a reporter.

572
00:48:29,590 --> 00:48:31,967
- What's his name again?
- Frank Baker.

573
00:48:32,093 --> 00:48:35,220
- Frank Baker.
- Come on, Jeff. You're putting the guy on.

574
00:48:35,346 --> 00:48:37,806
This is the guy who put me
on television, in living color.

575
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:40,600
- How you doing?
- Very well. I don't want to bust in.

576
00:48:40,726 --> 00:48:44,020
I just wondered
if you've got five minutes to talk.

577
00:48:44,188 --> 00:48:46,314
- Let's do it over a drink, huh?
- Good.

578
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,992
You know, uh...

579
00:48:57,118 --> 00:49:00,787
Chicago cops are getting
funnier-looking every day.

580
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:07,168
- I'm not a cop. I'm a soundman.
<i>- I bet you got credentials too.</i>

581
00:49:07,295 --> 00:49:10,755
The FBI supplies
the best credentials.

582
00:49:11,883 --> 00:49:14,634
We know, you know,
that one of the best ways...

583
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,888
for spying on black people
is to impersonate TV men.

584
00:49:18,014 --> 00:49:20,181
I'm up here with John
about a story.

585
00:49:20,308 --> 00:49:24,352
- What's that?
- That's my Pageboy.

586
00:49:24,478 --> 00:49:26,897
Your... Pageboy?

587
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,900
- Yeah.
- Hey, Richard...

588
00:49:30,026 --> 00:49:33,486
come and dig
this cat's Pageboy.

589
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:37,407
Now, what do you do
with "my Pageboy"?

590
00:49:37,533 --> 00:49:39,576
I don't do anything.
It just hangs there.

591
00:49:39,702 --> 00:49:43,788
The station, if they want me
to go someplace or do something,
they call me on it.

592
00:49:43,915 --> 00:49:46,416
Oh. You mean, they, uh —

593
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,585
they give you orders on this.

594
00:49:48,753 --> 00:49:50,378
Yeah.

595
00:49:53,674 --> 00:49:55,550
Man, you mean to tell me...

596
00:49:55,676 --> 00:49:58,929
they talk to you,
and you can't even talk back?

597
00:49:59,055 --> 00:50:02,474
He means he's a receiver
and not a sender.

598
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,603
Looks like they're calling you now.

599
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:08,647
You a white flunky
or something?

600
00:50:08,773 --> 00:50:12,359
Wrong. You've gotten
a bad idea about —

601
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:15,445
I forgot something downstairs.
I'll meet you in the car.

602
00:50:15,613 --> 00:50:16,947
Yeah, all right.

603
00:50:17,073 --> 00:50:19,950
- Coming back. He's coming back.
- Dig it, dig it, dig it.

604
00:50:20,076 --> 00:50:22,535
There he goes.
There he goes.

605
00:50:22,662 --> 00:50:24,454
A honky flunky.

606
00:50:26,874 --> 00:50:29,250
Look, man,
I've been on television...

607
00:50:29,377 --> 00:50:33,463
I've been in the newspapers,
and it's made my life total confusion.

608
00:50:33,589 --> 00:50:35,966
What do I do?
I find $10,000 in the cab...

609
00:50:36,092 --> 00:50:39,928
I'm boob enough to turn it in,
and I get my butt kicked by everybody.

610
00:50:40,054 --> 00:50:43,306
- Hey, no, man.
<i>- That's just it, Frank.</i>

611
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:46,851
<i>- It's a human interest story. People identify.</i>
- No, man.

612
00:50:46,978 --> 00:50:49,270
<i>- It'll be constructive.</i>
<i>- Are you coming, Frank?</i>

613
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:52,065
<i>I'll give you a call,</i>
<i>and we'll have another talk.</i>

614
00:50:52,191 --> 00:50:53,566
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

615
00:50:54,694 --> 00:50:58,029
Excuse me, TV man. You wanted
someone for an interview, right?

616
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:00,323
I haven't got time, dear.
I gotta run.

617
00:51:00,449 --> 00:51:03,702
Yeah, but I wanted to talk to you.
See, I'm a black actress, and —

618
00:51:03,828 --> 00:51:06,496
- Listen, honey, I haven't got time now.
- Don't "honey" me.

619
00:51:06,664 --> 00:51:08,456
I'm a black actress.

620
00:51:08,582 --> 00:51:10,834
I demand respect.
I'm not looking for —

621
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:13,837
- You call the station.
- No, you said you wanted somebody...

622
00:51:14,005 --> 00:51:15,922
so you want
to talk to somebody...

623
00:51:16,048 --> 00:51:18,299
hear what's going on,
what black people are doing?

624
00:51:18,426 --> 00:51:20,885
- Honey, I'm not interested right —
- Wait, wait, wait.

625
00:51:21,012 --> 00:51:22,887
- Don't "honey" me.
- No, no.

626
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:26,975
- You gotta start respecting our women.
- Look, I have no disrespect in mind.

627
00:51:27,101 --> 00:51:29,269
I gotta leave.
I don't have time.

628
00:51:29,395 --> 00:51:31,855
I want to talk to you
about what I'd like to do.

629
00:51:32,023 --> 00:51:33,857
You people are always busy...

630
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:36,359
putting your kind of people on
and what you want...

631
00:51:36,527 --> 00:51:39,154
so I want to talk
about what I want to do.

632
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:41,698
- Listen, dear.
- I told you about that "dear."

633
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:45,201
- I'm trying to be very respectful.
- We demand —

634
00:51:45,327 --> 00:51:47,996
- You demand what?
- Demand respect.

635
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:50,874
Oh, no. Oh, no.

636
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,709
- Handle it.
- I'll try.

637
00:51:52,835 --> 00:51:55,545
Don't call me "honey."
You're no honey of mine.

638
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:59,340
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
This is the guy that came by the house —

639
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:03,887
- I know who the guy is.
- So don't give him a bad time.

640
00:52:04,055 --> 00:52:05,972
Leave him alone.
He's all right.

641
00:52:06,098 --> 00:52:08,224
- Come on, baby.
- He's a jive —

642
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,518
Wait a minute.
I wanna talk to you.

643
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,520
- I don't —
- Come in. Come in.

644
00:52:12,646 --> 00:52:14,773
Wait a minute.
Let me ask you something.

645
00:52:14,899 --> 00:52:17,192
You being friendly,
or are you being tough?

646
00:52:17,318 --> 00:52:19,194
I just saved your life.
Understand?

647
00:52:19,320 --> 00:52:22,405
- If I got to be afraid —
- You understand I just saved your life?

648
00:52:22,573 --> 00:52:26,117
If I got to be afraid for your argument
to work, you got no argument.

649
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:29,746
Oh, no. All I want you to understand
is that I saved your life.

650
00:52:29,872 --> 00:52:34,459
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- You see, you came down here
to do some sort of jive interview.

651
00:52:34,585 --> 00:52:38,088
You did that.
Came down here with 15 minutes...

652
00:52:38,214 --> 00:52:41,800
of a black sensibility,
and, see, you don't understand that.

653
00:52:41,926 --> 00:52:44,135
You came down here
to shoot 15 minutes...

654
00:52:44,261 --> 00:52:46,471
of what has taken
300 years to develop.

655
00:52:46,597 --> 00:52:48,932
- Grief, you know?
<i>- I'm not interested in —</i>

656
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:52,936
And all we're trying to explain to you
is that you don't understand.

657
00:52:53,104 --> 00:52:55,855
I do something.
I do it well. That's my job.

658
00:52:55,981 --> 00:52:57,941
But you don't do it black enough.

659
00:52:58,067 --> 00:53:00,568
- You can't, because you're
not black. We are.
<i>- I'm white.</i>

660
00:53:00,694 --> 00:53:04,614
When you come and say you've come
to do something of human interest...

661
00:53:04,782 --> 00:53:08,159
it makes a person wonder
whether you're going to do...

662
00:53:08,285 --> 00:53:10,411
something of interest
to other humans...

663
00:53:10,538 --> 00:53:14,207
or whether you consider the person
human in whom you're interested.

664
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,418
And you have to understand that too.

665
00:53:17,545 --> 00:53:21,172
You can't just walk in
out of your arrogance...

666
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:23,716
and expect things
to be like they are...

667
00:53:23,843 --> 00:53:26,970
because when you walked in,
you brought La Salle Street...

668
00:53:27,096 --> 00:53:30,932
City Hall, and all
the mass communications media.

669
00:53:31,058 --> 00:53:32,976
And you are the exploiters.

670
00:53:33,144 --> 00:53:35,186
You're the ones who distort...

671
00:53:35,312 --> 00:53:38,314
and ridicule and emasculate us...

672
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,483
and that ain't cool.

673
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:43,820
You don't want to know, man.
You don't know the people.

674
00:53:43,988 --> 00:53:46,197
You don't show the people, jack.

675
00:53:46,323 --> 00:53:49,117
Dig. Here's some cat
who's down and out, you dig?

676
00:53:49,243 --> 00:53:51,744
He's nobody,
so he says to his old man...

677
00:53:51,871 --> 00:53:55,290
"Man, like, I'm nobody.
I'm gonna die, man...

678
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:57,792
and ain't nobody
gonna know I lived," dig?

679
00:53:57,918 --> 00:54:01,963
So the cat finds a brick and throws it
through Charlie's window. You understand.

680
00:54:02,089 --> 00:54:05,049
Or he takes a gun
and he shoots.

681
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:08,511
Then the cat lives, man.
He really lives, you dig?

682
00:54:08,637 --> 00:54:11,514
A hundred million people
see the cat on the tube, man...

683
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:14,058
and they say,
"Ooh, the former invisible man lives."

684
00:54:14,185 --> 00:54:18,271
Everybody knows where he went to school,
about his wife and kids and everything.

685
00:54:18,397 --> 00:54:21,399
You dig?
'Cause the tube is life, man.

686
00:54:21,525 --> 00:54:23,359
Life.

687
00:54:23,527 --> 00:54:27,947
You make him an Emmy, man.
You make him the TV star of the hour...

688
00:54:28,073 --> 00:54:31,910
on the 6:00, the 10:00,
and the 12:00 news.

689
00:54:32,036 --> 00:54:34,537
'Cause what the cat is saying
is truth, man.

690
00:54:34,663 --> 00:54:37,415
Why don't you find out
what really is?

691
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:40,084
Why you always got to wait
till somebody get killed?

692
00:54:40,211 --> 00:54:42,003
'Cause somebody
is gonna get killed!

693
00:55:02,983 --> 00:55:05,235
Is that thing loaded?

694
00:55:05,361 --> 00:55:07,445
As a matter of fact,
they call it a shotgun.

695
00:55:07,571 --> 00:55:09,739
It looks about 12 gauge.

696
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,701
- Let's go over here.
- Okay.

697
00:55:15,037 --> 00:55:18,414
Here's a good background.
Very good.

698
00:55:18,582 --> 00:55:20,917
- We can't shoot here.
- What do you mean?

699
00:55:21,043 --> 00:55:23,544
It's too noisy.
Those gunshots, they'll wipe us out.

700
00:55:23,671 --> 00:55:25,588
It's always too noisy, isn't it?

701
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:27,757
Okay, let's go back over here.

702
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:29,801
- Good for you?
- Yeah, fine.

703
00:55:31,553 --> 00:55:33,513
- Pepsi machine. Good enough?
- Fine.

704
00:55:33,639 --> 00:55:35,598
- Good boy.
- Excuse me.

705
00:55:35,724 --> 00:55:38,893
- What do I do now?
- Just speak in a normal tone of voice.

706
00:55:39,019 --> 00:55:41,646
- Speak in a normal tone of voice.
- Rolling here.

707
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:45,358
<i>- Tolling.</i>
- Well, there's been
about a 46 percent increase...

708
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:47,944
in pistol registration
since last year's riot.

709
00:55:48,112 --> 00:55:50,029
We're getting
our business from people...

710
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:52,949
who want to protect
their families and their homes.

711
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:55,159
- Can you hold a minute?
- Excuse me.

712
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:57,954
- The damn thing's stuck.
- Point that down, okay?

713
00:55:58,080 --> 00:56:00,915
I've only got one head.
There we go. See?

714
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:03,626
This release?
There. Okay?

715
00:56:03,794 --> 00:56:05,378
- Okay?
- Thank you.

716
00:56:05,504 --> 00:56:07,213
There we go.

717
00:56:08,674 --> 00:56:11,426
- Not bad.
- You ready again?

718
00:56:11,552 --> 00:56:13,720
You wanna start again?

719
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:17,307
Well, I don't know
what you're looking for.

720
00:56:17,433 --> 00:56:19,642
If a person
has a driver's license...

721
00:56:19,768 --> 00:56:22,312
he has to know how to drive...

722
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:26,733
and if a person gets a gun,
he has to know how to use it.

723
00:56:26,859 --> 00:56:29,736
How he uses it
or what he uses it for...

724
00:56:29,862 --> 00:56:31,654
is a personal right.

725
00:56:35,034 --> 00:56:37,660
Sorry.
Dick, let me have a dime.

726
00:56:37,786 --> 00:56:39,329
Sure, John.

727
00:56:42,082 --> 00:56:44,625
There you go.

728
00:56:44,752 --> 00:56:48,338
<i>I asked him where he was.</i>
<i>He said, "I was on vacation."</i>

729
00:56:48,464 --> 00:56:50,089
Hey, lover boy.

730
00:56:50,215 --> 00:56:52,175
Dede's looking for you.

731
00:57:04,897 --> 00:57:08,149
- You looking for me?
- Johnny.

732
00:57:08,275 --> 00:57:11,361
- Hey, there might be a little problem.
- What is it?

733
00:57:11,487 --> 00:57:15,448
I mean, well, Carlin came around
yesterday kind of mad.

734
00:57:15,574 --> 00:57:17,450
Oh, tell me something new.

735
00:57:17,576 --> 00:57:21,871
Johnny, you know
the outtakes for that footage?

736
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,707
- You know, the draft-card burners?
- Yeah.

737
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:27,043
Did you give that
to the light-show kids?

738
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:30,254
For chrissake, Dede, don't be cute.
What the hell did he say?

739
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:33,383
Well, he didn't say anything
definite, really. He, uh —

740
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:36,761
He just complained about you
being out when he needed you...

741
00:57:36,887 --> 00:57:39,597
and screwing around,
shooting stupid interviews —

742
00:57:39,723 --> 00:57:42,892
Listen, what the hell is up?
Don't tell me what you think.

743
00:57:43,018 --> 00:57:45,395
Just tell me what kind
of shit's flying around.

744
00:57:45,521 --> 00:57:47,438
Jesus, let go!

745
00:57:50,609 --> 00:57:52,860
Okay, okay, I'll tell you.

746
00:57:57,908 --> 00:58:02,078
Well, for about a year now...

747
00:58:02,204 --> 00:58:04,247
the station's been letting...

748
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:07,917
the cops and the FBI...

749
00:58:08,043 --> 00:58:09,961
study our footage.

750
00:58:11,964 --> 00:58:15,091
You're — You're putting me on.
You're kidding me.

751
00:58:15,217 --> 00:58:17,593
What am I, a fink?

752
00:58:17,719 --> 00:58:20,054
How can I go out
and cover a story?

753
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,306
It's a wonder more cameras
haven't been smashed!

754
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:25,309
I want to know why nobody told me
what's been going on...

755
00:58:25,436 --> 00:58:28,771
because you can bet your ass
out there in the streets, they know!

756
00:58:28,939 --> 00:58:31,065
You should've told me, Dede.

757
00:58:31,191 --> 00:58:32,692
Hey.

758
00:58:34,278 --> 00:58:36,988
- Just a sec, will you?
- Is he here? Where is he?

759
00:58:37,114 --> 00:58:38,906
I want to see him.

760
00:58:39,032 --> 00:58:42,869
Well, he won't be in this morning.
This is for you.

761
00:58:48,417 --> 00:58:52,712
Where the hell is he?
Why won't he be in, huh?

762
00:58:52,838 --> 00:58:54,922
What the hell is this crap?

763
00:59:19,573 --> 00:59:22,408
I don't know what day it plays.

764
00:59:22,534 --> 00:59:24,118
Wha—

765
00:59:24,244 --> 00:59:27,288
That was a business call!

766
00:59:28,499 --> 00:59:30,124
<i>Accounting.</i>

767
00:59:30,250 --> 00:59:33,002
Did you get a severance notice
for John Katselas?

768
00:59:33,128 --> 00:59:34,962
<i>Just a minute.</i>

769
00:59:36,882 --> 00:59:39,550
<i>Yes, I have it here.</i>
<i>Who's calling?</i>

770
00:59:41,803 --> 00:59:45,556
I'd tell 'em to stuff
their lousy job in a minute.

771
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,934
Well, you know that.
I would.

772
00:59:50,312 --> 00:59:52,188
I would.

773
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:55,691
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm with you, John.

774
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:59,237
I'll tell the bastards,
"If John goes, then I walk with him."

775
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:05,868
Well, I got to get moving.

776
01:00:07,412 --> 01:00:09,163
Take it easy, Gus.

777
01:00:31,895 --> 01:00:33,729
Remember me?

778
01:00:39,945 --> 01:00:41,737
Yeah.

779
01:00:41,863 --> 01:00:44,407
Yeah, I almost didn't
recognize you in that outfit.

780
01:00:44,533 --> 01:00:47,326
I work over there at Motorola.

781
01:00:47,452 --> 01:00:48,953
Oh.

782
01:00:50,622 --> 01:00:53,874
Well, it's been good seeing you.

783
01:00:57,004 --> 01:00:59,589
How's the pigeon boy doing?

784
01:00:59,715 --> 01:01:02,717
Real good. Just fine.

785
01:01:02,843 --> 01:01:06,387
- You always eat here?
- It's pretty bad, isn't it?

786
01:01:06,513 --> 01:01:08,764
Most times I bring my own.

787
01:01:12,603 --> 01:01:14,520
Where are you headed?

788
01:01:19,735 --> 01:01:21,736
<i>Did you finish your salad?</i>

789
01:01:21,862 --> 01:01:23,613
<i>You want some of mine?</i>

790
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,281
<i>Sure?</i>

791
01:01:29,494 --> 01:01:31,287
What's the matter?

792
01:01:32,664 --> 01:01:35,458
Maybe it's just that
he's not used to company, huh?

793
01:01:40,881 --> 01:01:42,923
What'd you do back home?

794
01:01:43,050 --> 01:01:45,009
<i>I was a schoolteacher.</i>

795
01:01:45,135 --> 01:01:47,720
You were?
Why aren't you teaching here?

796
01:01:47,846 --> 01:01:50,473
<i>Well, things are very different</i>
<i>up here. Down home...</i>

797
01:01:50,641 --> 01:01:54,226
I taught five grades in one room,
for one thing.

798
01:01:54,353 --> 01:01:57,521
Wow.
Like the little red schoolhouse.

799
01:01:57,648 --> 01:02:00,191
Kind of. But...

800
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:04,487
see, they don't recognize me
as a teacher up here.

801
01:02:04,655 --> 01:02:07,615
I mean, the education
that I had down home...

802
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:11,077
isn't good enough for them
for me to teach here, so I can't.

803
01:02:11,203 --> 01:02:13,579
But I don't think
I'd want to anyway.

804
01:02:13,705 --> 01:02:17,124
- I wouldn't want to teach
in the schools in this neighborhood.
- Why not?

805
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:19,543
They don't teach you nothing.

806
01:02:19,670 --> 01:02:22,755
It's a Chicago school.
They got to teach you something.

807
01:02:22,881 --> 01:02:27,343
They don't. They —
They run a television in there.

808
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:29,595
Well, they use TV these days.

809
01:02:29,721 --> 01:02:31,764
They use educational television.

810
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:35,685
Yeah, not that kind of TV.
You watch anything you want.

811
01:02:35,811 --> 01:02:38,229
They don't —
They don't try any —

812
01:02:38,355 --> 01:02:41,857
When you ask them to —
that you want to do some work...

813
01:02:41,983 --> 01:02:44,652
they say,
"No, you do what I tell you."

814
01:02:44,778 --> 01:02:47,863
- They let you watch TV, is that it?
- Yeah, that's all.

815
01:02:48,031 --> 01:02:51,117
- They don't do nothing else.
- Don't you like TV?

816
01:02:51,243 --> 01:02:52,868
Yeah, but —

817
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:55,246
Eh, you're probably doing
what you like.

818
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:58,541
<i>- Where are you from?</i>
- Right here. Chicago.

819
01:02:58,667 --> 01:03:02,628
CYO welterweight boxer, 1958.

820
01:03:04,005 --> 01:03:06,841
You ever box? Or do you just
wrestle when you fight?

821
01:03:06,967 --> 01:03:09,593
People down in here
use sticks, rocks...

822
01:03:09,720 --> 01:03:12,680
guns, and everything
down in here.

823
01:03:12,806 --> 01:03:15,307
- Nah, you don't use rocks, do you?
- Yeah.

824
01:03:15,434 --> 01:03:17,351
I don't. They do.

825
01:03:17,477 --> 01:03:21,105
- Only dirty fighters use rocks, right?
- And guns and sticks.

826
01:03:21,231 --> 01:03:23,065
- You got a gun?
- Huh-uh.

827
01:03:23,191 --> 01:03:25,067
- Play gun?
- Huh-uh.

828
01:03:25,193 --> 01:03:27,653
That's good.

829
01:03:27,779 --> 01:03:31,282
I shot a gun when I was eight —
I mean, ten years old.

830
01:03:31,408 --> 01:03:33,159
Where?

831
01:03:34,578 --> 01:03:36,454
West Virginia.

832
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:38,581
I'll take him with me
to CYO, maybe...

833
01:03:38,749 --> 01:03:41,083
and, uh, let him hit the bag.

834
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:50,760
I'm gonna watch TV.

835
01:03:50,886 --> 01:03:54,597
You help me put the plates in the sink,
and then you can go watch TV.

836
01:03:57,684 --> 01:03:59,685
I'll give you a hand here.

837
01:04:02,314 --> 01:04:04,857
Harold...

838
01:04:04,983 --> 01:04:06,942
is your bird okay?

839
01:04:08,028 --> 01:04:11,363
The other day, I thought you were
stealing something off my car.

840
01:04:11,490 --> 01:04:13,365
I don't steal!

841
01:04:13,492 --> 01:04:17,036
Anyway, what's so great
about your shitty car?

842
01:04:17,162 --> 01:04:19,205
I brought your bird back, didn't I?

843
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:24,460
Anyway, it's not my car.

844
01:04:33,178 --> 01:04:35,846
<i>Beverly Hillbillies,
<i>normally scheduled for this time...</i>

845
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:37,640
<i>will not be seen tonight.</i>

846
01:04:37,766 --> 01:04:40,267
<i>Instead, we bring you</i>
<i>the third part of a network special...</i>

<i>Martin Luther King...</i>

01:04:42,854 --> 01:04:44,480
<i>and Tobert Kennedy.</i>

849
01:05:04,084 --> 01:05:06,001
Why'd they fire you?

850
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:08,170
Can you get another job?

851
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:12,675
Can you get welfare —
I mean, unemployment?

852
01:05:12,801 --> 01:05:14,718
Do I look worried?

853
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:20,683
Too many questions.
Why they canned me —

854
01:05:20,851 --> 01:05:23,060
I'm not sure
I know the answer.

855
01:05:25,146 --> 01:05:29,066
I started a story about a cabdriver
who found all that cash somebody lost...

856
01:05:29,192 --> 01:05:32,361
and, for unknown reasons,
wouldn't claim.

857
01:05:32,529 --> 01:05:36,365
- Why?
- There's only one kind of money
a guy would be afraid to claim...

858
01:05:36,533 --> 01:05:38,868
and I had some idea
there was a connection...

859
01:05:38,994 --> 01:05:41,453
between guns, vigilante groups,
maybe getting ready...

860
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:43,873
for a blowup this summer,
you know?

861
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,793
Then I got sort of sidetracked.
Interested, so to speak.

862
01:05:47,919 --> 01:05:50,296
<i>But nobody said</i>
<i>anything about this.</i>

863
01:05:50,422 --> 01:05:52,715
My director just told
my union local...

864
01:05:52,883 --> 01:05:55,926
I had taken company film
without authorization.

865
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:58,262
You see,
it gets pretty complicated.

866
01:05:58,388 --> 01:06:01,098
People rarely say
the real reasons for things.

867
01:06:01,224 --> 01:06:04,351
Big corporations never do.

868
01:06:04,477 --> 01:06:06,395
Just politics.

869
01:06:06,521 --> 01:06:09,899
Plain bureaucratic politics.

870
01:06:10,025 --> 01:06:12,610
I guess it's the season up here.

871
01:06:12,736 --> 01:06:15,571
Anyway, we only been
in Chicago a little while.

872
01:06:15,697 --> 01:06:17,907
Not even long enough
for me to vote.

873
01:06:21,328 --> 01:06:24,914
Come on. Tell me how you managed
to teach five grades in one classroom.

874
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:29,752
I didn't manage.
One thing I did was —

875
01:06:29,878 --> 01:06:32,421
Well, I just had three
in the third grade...

876
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,757
<i>so I put one boy up to fourth...</i>

877
01:06:34,883 --> 01:06:36,926
and a boy and a girl
back to second.

878
01:06:37,093 --> 01:06:40,262
That way,
I only had four grades.

879
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,932
Is that the new math?

880

901
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,336
<i>because I've been</i>

902
01:08:36,463 --> 01:08:39,548
<i>I don't mind.</i>

903
01:08:43,178 --> 01:08:47,765
<i>Like anybody,</i>
<i>I would like to live a long life.</i>

904
01:08:47,891 --> 01:08:51,560
<i>Longevity has its place.</i>

905
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:55,022
<i>But I'm not concerned</i>
<i>about that now.</i>

906
01:08:55,148 --> 01:08:57,816
<i>I just want to do God's will.</i>

907
01:08:59,194 --> 01:09:01,570
<i>And he's allowed me</i>
<i>to go up to the mountain.</i>

908
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04,573
- Jesus, I love to shoot film.
<i>- I've looked over...</i>

<i>- to the promised land.</i>

915
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:25,010
You feel it?

916
01:09:25,136 --> 01:09:27,554
X-rays? Is that what it is?
Does it grow hair?

917
01:09:27,680 --> 01:09:29,556
Is it vitamins?

918
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:31,725
Can you feel violence?

919
01:09:31,851 --> 01:09:34,061
I don't know what to think.

920
01:09:34,187 --> 01:09:37,940
Seems like no man's life's
worth anything anymore.

921
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:42,945
You see...

922
01:09:43,071 --> 01:09:45,114
the media's got a script now.

923
01:09:45,240 --> 01:09:46,949
By the numbers.

924
01:09:47,075 --> 01:09:49,993
Flags at half-mast.
Trips canceled.

925
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:52,246
Ball games called off.
Schools closed.

926
01:09:52,372 --> 01:09:55,165
<i>...flags at half-mast.</i>

927

Memorial meetings.
Memorial marches.

928
01:09:57,919 --> 01:10:00,712
Moments of silence.

929
01:10:00,839 --> 01:10:03,382
The widow cries,
and then she says brave words.

930
01:10:03,508 --> 01:10:06,677
- More moments of silence...
<i>- Standing by in our Washington studio...</i>

<i>and the contemporary scene.</i>

932
01:10:11,432 --> 01:10:13,892
A lot of experts...

933
01:10:14,018 --> 01:10:17,312
saying how sick our society is,
how sick we all are.

934
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:21,692
The script is a national drain-off.

935
01:10:23,570 --> 01:10:27,489
People say, "Yeah, yeah.
We're guilty. We're bad."

936
01:10:27,657 --> 01:10:30,284
'Cause a lot of people are afraid.
They're afraid...

937
01:10:30,410 --> 01:10:33,871
the Negroes are going to tear up
their stores, burn neighborhoods...

938
01:10:33,997 --> 01:10:37,958
so they have this nationwide,
coast-to-coast network special...

939
01:10:38,084 --> 01:10:40,127
called "Mourn the Martyr."

940
01:10:40,253 --> 01:10:42,171
Nobody's really
on the hook, you see?

941
01:10:42,297 --> 01:10:45,716
<i>Traditionally, religion</i>
<i>has supplied the moral backstop.</i>

942
01:10:45,842 --> 01:10:49,845
But when the script is finished
and Tuesday comes around...

943
01:10:49,971 --> 01:10:52,848
or Saturday, and...

944
01:10:52,974 --> 01:10:55,726
National Drain-Off Week is over...

945
01:10:57,270 --> 01:11:00,564
everybody goes
pretty much back to normal.

946
01:11:00,690 --> 01:11:02,941
Normal this, normal that.

947
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:05,235
You know, normal.

Mm-hmm.

women just don't understand a man.

You twain become one flesh,

Mm-hmm.

like they want to go out
on their own.

1005

take over things.

the problem on this job, baby.

1053
01:21:19,099 --> 01:21:21,476
This job is keeping up

01:21:34,782 --> 01:21:37,158
Ruth.

1069
01:22:34,300 --> 01:22:36,175
That's the stockyards.
