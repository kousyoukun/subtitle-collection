1
00:01:43,906 --> 00:01:46,033
Better call an ambulance.

2
00:01:56,752 --> 00:02:00,381
- 5251, Chicago.
- 5251.

3
00:02:00,464 --> 00:02:02,425
Better send an ambulance
out to the Eisenhower...

4
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:04,427
in front of
the MacKenzie turnoff.

5
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:08,681
Got a wreck. We got coverage.
We'll send it in with the bike man.

6
00:02:08,764 --> 00:02:11,392
- Ten-four.
- Okay.

7
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:14,604
5251, clear.

8
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:30,031
Now, that's his public posture,
but he's the one who's right there...

9
00:04:30,072 --> 00:04:34,118
with his eyes glued to the screen
when the blood starts running--

10
00:04:34,201 --> 00:04:37,371
And he's the one who says,
"Ooh, isn't it horrible?.

11
00:04:37,455 --> 00:04:39,916
Isn't it horrible?.
Let me see some more."

12
00:04:39,957 --> 00:04:42,043
There are a lot of people
who buy The New York Times.

13
00:04:42,084 --> 00:04:45,254
What I mean to say
is that it happens--

14
00:04:45,338 --> 00:04:49,425
It has happened always,
whether it was a photographer...

15
00:04:49,508 --> 00:04:52,303
or a journalist or a cameraman.

16
00:04:52,386 --> 00:04:55,765
When you are in the middle
of something happening, you--

17
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:58,059
It is a risk
of the profession.

18
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:02,229
What's the difference between a person
who types something and a typewriter?.

19
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:05,274
The typewriter doesn't really care
about what's being typed.

20
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:09,570
But a typewriter's a machine,
and you're not a machine.

21
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,659
Actually, I'm kind of an elongation
of a tape recorder.

22
00:05:16,369 --> 00:05:19,330
I've made films on all kinds
of social problems.

23
00:05:19,413 --> 00:05:22,083
The big bombs were the ones
where we went into detail...

24
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:24,335
and showed
why something happened.

25
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:27,672
Nobody wants to take the time. They'd
rather see 30 seconds of somebody...

26
00:05:27,755 --> 00:05:31,467
getting their skull cracked, turn off
the TV and say, "Let me have a beer."

27
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,844
But Hollywood, the news med--

28
00:05:33,928 --> 00:05:38,015
Well, our position
is one to-- to record.

29
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:39,976
The dynamics that are
happening in society--

30
00:05:40,059 --> 00:05:42,353
We don't deal
with the static things.

31
00:05:42,436 --> 00:05:45,773
We deal with the violence.
We deal with--

32
00:05:45,815 --> 00:05:49,151
Who wants to see somebody sitting,
to see somebody lying down...

33
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,280
somebody talking peace,
unless they're talking loud?.

34
00:05:52,363 --> 00:05:54,824
The cameraman
makes the choice himself.

35
00:05:54,907 --> 00:05:57,410
He's out
to get the blood and guts.

36
00:05:57,493 --> 00:05:59,495
I believe that.
The other night on television...

37
00:05:59,579 --> 00:06:01,706
there was a fellow in Gary--
in the ghetto.

38
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:04,709
If there's something else that maybe
is nice, that could fill the news...

39
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:08,796
he'll take the stabbing, even if
he's had 27 minutes of stabbing before.

40
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:11,841
They're someplace safe,
away from it. They deplore it...

41
00:06:11,882 --> 00:06:14,218
but they deplore it
like all good people.

42
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:18,180
All good people deplore problems
at a distance, like Thomas Jefferson.

43
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:20,474
He loved the common man,
but at a distance.

44
00:06:20,558 --> 00:06:22,226
This is exactly what happened.

45
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,271
Five cameramen have been killed,
one in Germany.

46
00:06:25,354 --> 00:06:29,984
He was beat to death by a mob,
literally beat to death-- for UPI.

47
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:34,113
Know the excuse?. The crowd thought
he was taking pictures for the police.

48
00:06:34,196 --> 00:06:37,325
They had a couple of fellas
in a civil rights protest...

49
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:40,494
that were chained together,
and I was taking pictures.

50
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:42,371
Cops said, "Don't you think
you'd better load the camera?'

51
00:06:42,455 --> 00:06:44,999
I says, "I'm not out of film."
They said, "Load it anyway.

52
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,752
We wanna move these guys."
And he starts pushing the lens.

53
00:06:47,835 --> 00:06:50,212
I says, "The next time you push me,
I'll fall down and start crying."

54
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:51,881
He walked away.

55
00:06:51,964 --> 00:06:55,259
The 1 20 Angineaux lens,
and yanking back and forth...

56
00:06:55,343 --> 00:06:59,347
yelling "Black Power" at me,
and I'm just shaking to death...

57
00:06:59,388 --> 00:07:01,933
with a $1,200 lens on the camera.

58
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:05,019
I am in the middle.
I got no place to hide.

59
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:09,607
I'm carrying a 40-pound camera,
trying to get pictures of it.

60
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,903
The rioterwants to beat me up, thinks
I'm trying to identify him for police.

61
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:16,906
The policeman wants to elbow me
out of the way...

62
00:07:16,948 --> 00:07:19,867
and I'm being gentle about it because
he doesn't want the sergeant to see...

63
00:07:19,909 --> 00:07:23,996
he picked up some guy by his neck
and threw him in the backseat of a car.

64
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,707
Then the editor says,
"I want the pictures.

65
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:29,752
My audience doesn't care
what brought this on."

66
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:32,672
You have to feed your family.
You need the money.

67
00:07:32,755 --> 00:07:34,674
Ifyou don't bring them back,
you're not going to have a job.

68
00:07:34,757 --> 00:07:39,178
Forget that. I've got a job to do,
and I'm interested in it.

69
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:44,600
The point I resent very much is the fact
that wherever I go, I'm beat up.

70
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:48,854
Shoot into those troops!.
Shoot 'em!

71
00:07:48,938 --> 00:07:51,607
Shoot the shit out of'em!
Get 'em!

72
00:07:51,691 --> 00:07:53,401
You guys are shot!

73
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:56,112
What kind of country is this?.
What's wrong?.

74
00:07:56,195 --> 00:07:59,323
We're people! Why do you
have soldiers here with bayonets?.

75
00:08:02,201 --> 00:08:04,787
We got a captive. Hold on.

76
00:08:13,796 --> 00:08:19,051
That was an unprovoked attack
that was retaliatory--

77
00:08:19,135 --> 00:08:20,595
Not me. Not me.

78
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:23,306
This man has an obsolete weapon.

79
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:25,433
Make love, not war.

80
00:08:26,684 --> 00:08:29,812
They stabbed one of our guys
in the belly.

81
00:08:29,895 --> 00:08:33,274
I am Brigadier General
Richard T. Dunn...

82
00:08:33,316 --> 00:08:36,819
commanding general of the
emergency operation headquarters...

83
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:39,697
of the Illinois Army
National Guard.

84
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:42,158
The emergency operation
headquarters...

85
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:45,828
is one which
was established last winter...

86
00:08:45,912 --> 00:08:49,582
for the purpose ofplanning
and controlling operations...

87
00:08:49,665 --> 00:08:52,001
in the event
of civil disturbances.

88
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:54,712
Over.

89
00:08:54,795 --> 00:08:57,381
Out in the street,
their bayonets are fixed...

90
00:08:57,465 --> 00:09:01,969
and they know it's for real
in a real riot in the city.

91
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:04,430
And here we know
it's more or less--

92
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:06,432
It's a war game, more or less.

93
00:09:06,515 --> 00:09:07,850
How's it going so far?

94
00:09:07,892 --> 00:09:10,186
I couldn't tellyou.
I'm the enemy.

95
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:12,563
We love you guys.

96
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:16,901
We have women foryou, beer.

97
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:19,320
Come on!

98
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:23,324
- Sing it, now.
- Glory, glory, hallelujah

99
00:09:31,207 --> 00:09:35,544
His truth is marching on

100
00:09:35,628 --> 00:09:38,172
- When do we want freedom?
- Now!

101
00:09:38,256 --> 00:09:41,050
- When do we want equality?
- Now!

102
00:09:41,092 --> 00:09:43,552
- When are we gonna get it?
- Now!

103
00:09:43,594 --> 00:09:47,181
It is what our forefathers fought for--
the free choice ofpeople!

104
00:09:47,223 --> 00:09:48,516
Y eah!

105
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,560
This country is changing.

106
00:09:51,644 --> 00:09:53,688
It is no longer
for all the people.

107
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:57,233
- It is for some ofthe people.
- Y eah!

108
00:09:57,316 --> 00:10:00,486
- We see a war we do not want.
- Y eah!

109
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,364
We see an apathy towards
love and brotherhood.

110
00:10:03,406 --> 00:10:04,532
Y eah!

111
00:10:04,615 --> 00:10:07,660
- Bring out the mayor.
- We want the mayor!

112
00:10:09,078 --> 00:10:12,373
- Hold on.
- We want the mayor!

113
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:15,126
We want the mayor!

114
00:10:20,006 --> 00:10:22,758
We'll bring thejudge
out to talk to you.

115
00:10:22,842 --> 00:10:26,178
We want the mayor!
We don't want a flunky!

116
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:28,347
We want the mayor!

117
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:33,436
My friends,
I've stood before you many times.

118
00:10:33,477 --> 00:10:35,521
Tell it to 'em, Mayor!

119
00:10:36,272 --> 00:10:40,401
You elected me mayor ofthis town
for the last 20 years.

120
00:10:40,443 --> 00:10:42,445
- No, we didn 't!
- Tell it to 'em!

121
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:47,825
We've given you everything
that we thought you needed.

122
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:54,415
I've let you use our swimming pool
every 4th ofJuly.

123
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:56,876
We want it every day ofthe year!

124
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,503
We've operated--

125
00:10:59,587 --> 00:11:03,549
We've operated the liquor store
with a minimum ofprofit.

126
00:11:03,633 --> 00:11:06,218
Sock it to 'em, baby!
Sock it to 'em.

127
00:11:06,302 --> 00:11:10,890
I understand that
you have some problems.

128
00:11:13,434 --> 00:11:17,355
- You have avoided our problems!
- I understand that you have--

129
00:11:18,981 --> 00:11:22,109
I understand that
you have some complaints.

130
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:27,365
We shall overcome.
We shall overcome.

131
00:11:27,448 --> 00:11:31,702
We shall overcome

132
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:45,383
Some day

133
00:12:09,865 --> 00:12:11,242
Yeah

134
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,455
Get the guys with the cameras.

135
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:30,219
Four, three, two, one.

136
00:12:30,303 --> 00:12:33,931
Fade in.
Richard starts back.

137
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:38,477
And cue announce.
And keep on coming.

138
00:12:39,478 --> 00:12:42,565
- And hold.
- What's wrong?

139
00:12:42,648 --> 00:12:45,985
Now.
Down and in slowly.

140
00:12:46,027 --> 00:12:47,653
Very slowly.

141
00:12:49,822 --> 00:12:52,158
You riding iris on this,
Jerry, or what?

142
00:12:54,702 --> 00:12:57,330
Slate on one.
Stand by to take.

143
00:12:59,165 --> 00:13:01,709
Roll tape to record.
In, Arnold.

144
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:07,590
- Stand by.
- Four, three...

145
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:09,508
two, one.

146
00:13:09,592 --> 00:13:11,344
Fade in.

147
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:21,520
You want to move
over here, please?.

148
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:24,148
Let's go. Time is money.
Let's go.

149
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,276
Gus, is the El too loud for you?.

150
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,320
No, we can live with it.

151
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,283
Who here
is old enough to vote?.

152
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:36,869
I took my physical last week.

153
00:13:36,953 --> 00:13:38,871
Physical to vote?.

154
00:13:39,956 --> 00:13:43,709
- Why are you working for Kennedy?.
- He's the best.

155
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:46,337
- He's got long hair.
- He's against the war.

156
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:48,714
- What are you doing here?.
- She's my friend.

157
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:52,593
He's an idealist. He's for anyone
who hasn't got a chance.

158
00:13:52,677 --> 00:13:56,472
- Who are you for?.
- I don't like him because of Oswald...

159
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:58,641
and Dallas and all that.

160
00:13:58,724 --> 00:14:01,310
What does that have
to do with it?.

161
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:03,688
I think he should have
looked into it.

162
00:14:03,729 --> 00:14:06,107
There's a lot of serious questions
that haven't been answered.

163
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:08,651
In the Saturday Evening Post
there was a statement...

164
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,696
that the CIA knew about
Lee Harvey Oswald's trip to Mexico...

165
00:14:11,779 --> 00:14:14,448
only two months
before John Kennedy--

166
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:24,602
May I help you?

167
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,992
Damn it. It looks
like I'm a prime target.

168
00:15:41,869 --> 00:15:44,664
First the hubcaps,
now my radio antenna.

169
00:15:54,173 --> 00:15:55,967
Rotten kids.

170
00:15:56,008 --> 00:15:59,470
What's the difference?. Channel Eight's
got more where these came from.

171
00:15:59,512 --> 00:16:01,681
That's not the point.

172
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:03,182
What?.

173
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:08,271
- Where do you want to go?.
- How about a movie?.

174
00:17:38,986 --> 00:17:41,155
Come on. Go after her!

175
00:17:41,239 --> 00:17:42,782
Attagirl!

176
00:17:44,033 --> 00:17:47,078
In the crotch! Atta baby!
In the crotch!

177
00:17:54,377 --> 00:17:56,379
Kill her!

178
00:17:56,462 --> 00:17:58,881
- Kill her!
- Pull her hair!

179
00:18:01,342 --> 00:18:04,053
- Tie her up!
- Kick her in the back!

180
00:18:04,136 --> 00:18:05,888
Kick her in the back!

181
00:18:05,972 --> 00:18:07,306
Yea!

182
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,561
Let's see some action!

183
00:18:13,771 --> 00:18:15,815
You're just a chicken!

184
00:18:21,654 --> 00:18:23,656
Go to work. Go to work.

185
00:18:27,493 --> 00:18:28,995
Go! Go! Go!

186
00:18:58,774 --> 00:19:01,277
- No cheating.
- Goes foryou too.

187
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,030
That's right.

188
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:05,740
All right.
Deuces are wild, Robert.

189
00:19:07,992 --> 00:19:09,452
Whoops.

190
00:19:14,206 --> 00:19:16,167
All right.
Show him what to do.

191
00:19:21,589 --> 00:19:23,799
Now, deuces are wild, Robert.

192
00:19:23,883 --> 00:19:26,719
They count as anything
you want 'em to.

193
00:19:26,761 --> 00:19:29,138
Hold 'em. Hold 'em.

194
00:19:29,221 --> 00:19:32,224
Take this one.
Throw the rest away.

195
00:19:32,308 --> 00:19:34,060
- This?.
- How many you want?.

196
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:37,688
- I want four.
- Four?.

197
00:19:37,772 --> 00:19:40,066
- How many you want?.
- Five.

198
00:19:40,107 --> 00:19:41,901
You mean four.

199
00:19:43,444 --> 00:19:45,279
No cheating, now.

200
00:19:50,743 --> 00:19:53,829
- Two aces. What do you got?.
- I got two treys.

201
00:19:53,913 --> 00:19:55,623
Two treys.

202
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,419
- What'd you do?. You throw--
- I got two aces.

203
00:20:00,503 --> 00:20:03,047
You throwed down
my three nines down, didn't you?.

204
00:20:03,089 --> 00:20:04,799
No, he got 'em.

205
00:20:04,882 --> 00:20:06,884
I didn't get 'em.
They're in the deck.

206
00:20:08,386 --> 00:20:11,180
He threw 'em down.

207
00:20:11,264 --> 00:20:13,516
Boy, it's hot.
You got anything to drink?.

208
00:20:18,229 --> 00:20:20,481
Miss Horton,
you have anything to drink?.

209
00:20:20,523 --> 00:20:23,276
- There's plenty ofwater in the sink.
- I don't want any water.

210
00:20:23,359 --> 00:20:26,862
I want a Coke or something.
Let's go get a Coke, Robert.

211
00:20:30,366 --> 00:20:32,326
We'll see you there.

212
00:20:42,211 --> 00:20:45,214
- Where'd your friends go?.
- To get a Coke.

213
00:20:45,298 --> 00:20:47,008
Get a Coke?.

214
00:20:49,552 --> 00:20:53,180
- What was you playing?.
- Deuces wild.

215
00:20:53,222 --> 00:20:55,641
- Who won?.
- Nobody.

216
00:20:55,725 --> 00:20:57,476
Nobody.

217
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,021
- What's the matter?.
- Nothing.

218
00:21:01,105 --> 00:21:03,691
You're pretty dirty.
You've been working them birds.

219
00:21:03,774 --> 00:21:06,861
You'd better go wash up
before we eat supper.

220
00:21:09,822 --> 00:21:11,657
Well, go on.

221
00:21:13,117 --> 00:21:14,994
Go on, now. Get.

222
00:21:59,622 --> 00:22:01,624
We thank Thee, Lord,
for this food.

223
00:22:01,707 --> 00:22:05,127
Bless it to the nourishment
of our bodies. In Thy name we pray.

224
00:22:05,211 --> 00:22:06,504
Amen.

225
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:41,914
"The racing pigeon,
or homing pigeon...

226
00:22:41,998 --> 00:22:46,460
remains faithful to its mate
throughout its life...

227
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:51,299
provided that the mate
is present at all times...

228
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,303
especially when
the male bird returns...

229
00:22:55,344 --> 00:22:57,513
after a long flight.

230
00:22:57,597 --> 00:23:00,850
In addition,
when the pair has young...

231
00:23:00,891 --> 00:23:03,769
this bond is even stronger.

232
00:23:03,853 --> 00:23:07,607
If, however,
the family is separated...

233
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:09,734
for an extended period...

234
00:23:09,817 --> 00:23:14,655
the male pigeon,
not unlike his human counterpart...

235
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:16,824
can be relied upon...

236
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:22,788
to seek female companionship
elsewhere. "

237
00:23:25,291 --> 00:23:26,959
Roll it up.

238
00:23:34,050 --> 00:23:36,677
This may be the last time

239
00:23:42,224 --> 00:23:44,352
May be the last time
but I don 't know

240
00:23:44,393 --> 00:23:47,229
Well, it may be the last time
you march on the capitol

241
00:23:50,024 --> 00:23:52,568
Well, it may be the last time
you march on Congress

242
00:23:54,403 --> 00:23:57,865
Well, it may be the last time
you march foryour freedom

243
00:24:00,451 --> 00:24:02,703
Thinking, this may be the last time

244
00:24:02,745 --> 00:24:04,872
Appalachia.
You see the si gn?.

245
00:24:04,914 --> 00:24:07,166
- Could we get a drink of water first?.
- T o hell with the water.

246
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,377
Let's find this guy.

247
00:24:10,795 --> 00:24:13,589
They're behind the Mexicans,
ain't they?.

248
00:24:13,673 --> 00:24:17,218
I heard they were behind
the San Francisco contingent.

249
00:24:17,301 --> 00:24:20,805
- This is in this direction here.
- I thought it was a blue tent.

250
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:23,015
I don't know how these people
listen to this crap.

251
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:26,102
I don't know how long
this is gonna keep going.

252
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:29,105
- Well, where is it?.
- Let's go this way.

253
00:24:50,793 --> 00:24:54,338
I would hope, now that
the California primary is finished...

254
00:24:54,422 --> 00:24:56,299
now that these primaries are over...

255
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,176
that we could now concentrate
on having a dialogue...

256
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:03,139
or a debate, I hope,
between the vice president and myself...

257
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:04,849
of what direction
we want to go in.

258
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:14,775
Mayor Yorty hasjust
sent me a message...

259
00:25:14,859 --> 00:25:17,153
that we've been here
too long already.

260
00:25:19,405 --> 00:25:21,574
- We love you, Bob.
- My thanks to all ofyou...

261
00:25:21,657 --> 00:25:24,118
and now it's on to Chicago,
and let's win there.

262
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,125
We want Bobby!

263
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,052
Oh, no
I don 't believe it

264
00:25:41,135 --> 00:25:45,514
You say that you think
you know the meaning oflove

265
00:25:48,935 --> 00:25:52,229
You say love is all we need

266
00:25:52,313 --> 00:25:54,982
You say with your love

267
00:25:55,024 --> 00:25:59,320
You could change all ofthe fools
all ofthe hate

268
00:25:59,362 --> 00:26:02,823
I thinkyou're probably
out to lunch

269
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:14,168
You guys here
to cover the funeral?.

270
00:26:14,252 --> 00:26:16,379
Yeah, that's what we're here for.

271
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:20,007
I didn't hear you
come in last night.

272
00:26:21,008 --> 00:26:22,718
You score?.

273
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:28,099
You left the TV set on.

274
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:35,106
You know, you can meet a lot of
interesting people in a cocktail lounge.

275
00:26:36,691 --> 00:26:40,236
You know that for every man in D.C.,
there are four and a halfwomen?.

276
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:50,162
It's a beautiful city, huh?.
Wow. Beautiful.

277
00:26:51,914 --> 00:26:54,292
Boy, this air-conditioning
really gets you.

278
00:27:00,506 --> 00:27:02,508
Look at these guys.

279
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,388
Couple of hours,
they're all set up.

280
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:14,604
Twenty, twenty-five camera positions--
like nothing.

281
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:22,361
They've had experience
since we did J.F.K. in '63.

282
00:27:46,677 --> 00:27:48,471
Hello, ladies.

283
00:28:00,483 --> 00:28:02,443
What are your plans
for the summer--

284
00:28:02,485 --> 00:28:05,279
this, which will be
a very political summer...

285
00:28:05,321 --> 00:28:06,948
and possibly a very hot one.

286
00:28:07,031 --> 00:28:09,242
Oh, well, now,
let's not get into politics.

287
00:28:10,409 --> 00:28:14,705
Well, we always go up
to our place...

288
00:28:14,789 --> 00:28:19,460
up in Ontario, up in Canada.

289
00:28:19,502 --> 00:28:21,712
It's a place called Desbras.

290
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:24,257
That's D-E-S. It's French.

291
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:26,217
It's not like a girl's name.

292
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,553
And, well, about this time ofyear,
we always start looking forward...

293
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:34,684
to getting away from the city
and the crowds and the heat.

294
00:28:34,767 --> 00:28:37,728
It's very primitive up there.

295
00:28:37,812 --> 00:28:41,899
And I think sometimes
it's good for the soul...

296
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:45,820
to get away from civilization,
don't you think so?.

297
00:29:09,093 --> 00:29:11,178
- Hello.
- Hello.

298
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:14,932
- Is your mother home?.
- Yes. No.

299
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:18,477
- No?. Is she working?.
- Yes.

300
00:29:18,561 --> 00:29:21,522
What time will she be home?.

301
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:24,400
- At 1 2:00.
- I see.

302
00:29:24,483 --> 00:29:28,529
- Now, how long have you lived here?.
- I don't know.

303
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:29,739
- You don't know?.
- No.

304
00:29:29,822 --> 00:29:32,533
Could you tell me where you lived
before you moved here?.

305
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:35,119
- Yes.
- Where?.

306
00:29:35,202 --> 00:29:39,582
- West Virginia.
- I see.

307
00:29:39,665 --> 00:29:41,876
Now, how many rooms do you have?.

308
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:44,712
- No-- yeah. Four.
- Four rooms.

309
00:29:44,754 --> 00:29:48,215
- Do you have a TV set?.
- Yes.

310
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:49,884
- Do you have a stereo?.
- Yes.

311
00:29:49,967 --> 00:29:53,763
And how many brothers
and sisters do you have?.

312
00:29:53,846 --> 00:29:56,515
- None.
- You're the only child?.

313
00:29:56,599 --> 00:29:59,810
- Yes.
- And how old are you?.

314
00:29:59,894 --> 00:30:01,896
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen. Really?.

315
00:30:01,938 --> 00:30:04,565
- And do you go to church?.
- Yes.

316
00:30:04,649 --> 00:30:06,192
That's a good boy.

317
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:10,196
- Now, what is your father's name?.
- Buddy.

318
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:12,865
- What?.
- Buddy.

319
00:30:12,949 --> 00:30:15,409
- Does he live here at home with you?.
- No.

320
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:18,204
Could you tell me
where I could find him?.

321
00:30:20,331 --> 00:30:21,791
At Vietnam.

322
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:26,295
Let's go see
what damage we done up here.

323
00:30:31,968 --> 00:30:35,179
- Look at the holes there.
- Golly!

324
00:30:35,263 --> 00:30:37,223
Look around and see
ifyou can find another.

325
00:30:40,393 --> 00:30:43,020
Hell, I got something here.
Come here.

326
00:30:43,104 --> 00:30:45,773
I ain't gonna waste this, though.

327
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:47,441
Drink this.

328
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,785
Come on.

329
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:03,165
- You want to shoot it?.
- Uh-uh.

330
00:31:03,207 --> 00:31:06,961
It ain't gonna hurt you.
Just put a shell in like that.

331
00:31:07,003 --> 00:31:09,964
- It's safe. It won't hurt you at all.
- I don't want to shoot it.

332
00:31:10,006 --> 00:31:12,008
Draw it back.

333
00:31:13,134 --> 00:31:15,761
Knock it off of there.
That's all you got to do.

334
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:19,015
Come on. Let's go.

335
00:31:20,057 --> 00:31:22,351
Come on.
Let's go look at pigeons.

336
00:32:22,787 --> 00:32:24,872
Nothing's missing. I looked.

337
00:32:30,586 --> 00:32:35,007
You out of shape, pal?.
What's in the basket?.

338
00:32:37,093 --> 00:32:38,344
Dinner.

339
00:32:57,905 --> 00:33:01,659
Why don'tyou admit it?
Go on.Just say it.

340
00:33:01,784 --> 00:33:04,078
You're a bastard.

341
00:33:06,998 --> 00:33:09,542
Admit it to me.

342
00:33:09,625 --> 00:33:12,587
Admit it to yourself.

343
00:33:12,628 --> 00:33:17,216
You're a rotten,
egotistical, selfish...

344
00:33:20,011 --> 00:33:22,096
punchy cameraman.

345
00:33:28,477 --> 00:33:29,729
Well?.

346
00:33:33,316 --> 00:33:34,734
Well?. Well?.

347
00:33:40,156 --> 00:33:42,658
Look at this here. Look.

348
00:33:44,035 --> 00:33:46,495
How do you like it?.
Gus wired it up for me.

349
00:33:46,579 --> 00:33:51,083
Look back there.
Fiber optics. Great, huh?.

350
00:33:52,627 --> 00:33:54,754
See the TV?. Lights.

351
00:33:54,837 --> 00:33:57,673
- Look at that.
- John.

352
00:33:59,508 --> 00:34:02,970
Do you remember
when we saw Mondo Cane?

353
00:34:03,054 --> 00:34:07,016
- We didn't see Mondo Cane.
- Well, I saw it.

354
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:09,477
I saw it, too, but I don't
remember seeing it with you.

355
00:34:11,646 --> 00:34:14,315
Well, anyway,
that's not the point.

356
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:16,484
What's the point?.

357
00:34:17,568 --> 00:34:20,154
Well, you remember that scene...

358
00:34:20,238 --> 00:34:22,949
on an island,
where they tested an atom bomb?.

359
00:34:23,032 --> 00:34:24,700
Yeah.

360
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:28,204
Well, there were
these big turtles...

361
00:34:28,246 --> 00:34:31,999
you know, tortoises, who,
at a certain time in their lives...

362
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:36,087
would walk to the sea
to lay their eggs.

363
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,631
And they found that
the radiation thing...

364
00:34:38,714 --> 00:34:40,841
threw the turtles'
sense of direction...

365
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:44,720
so instead of heading to the sea,
they went inland and died.

366
00:34:44,804 --> 00:34:47,223
Oh, I'm crying.

367
00:34:49,809 --> 00:34:51,811
Damn it!

368
00:34:51,894 --> 00:34:54,647
Look, somebody
took those movies, right?.

369
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:57,858
I mean, do you think
did they or didn't they...

370
00:34:57,942 --> 00:35:01,529
after they took those movies--

371
00:35:01,571 --> 00:35:05,157
Do you think-- Did they reach down
and turn those turtles around...

372
00:35:06,158 --> 00:35:08,828
or did they put them in a jeep
and drive them back?.

373
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:12,415
How the hell do I know what they did?.
Those were Italian cameramen.

374
00:35:16,252 --> 00:35:18,963
I give up. I surrender.

375
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,637
No calories.

376
00:35:28,264 --> 00:35:30,558
I'd rather
keep my kidneys for a while.

377
00:35:40,318 --> 00:35:44,155
"Research physicians at the Istituto
del Salvador Muni in Rome...

378
00:35:44,238 --> 00:35:46,324
reveal today the results of tests...

379
00:35:46,407 --> 00:35:48,868
involving a new device to be worn
by expectant mothers...

380
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:51,454
during the entire course
of their pregnancy.

381
00:35:51,537 --> 00:35:54,749
This device consists
of a steel and plastic cylinder...

382
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,793
which can be controlled
to create a partial vacuum...

383
00:35:57,877 --> 00:36:02,423
around the mother's abdomen, reducing
atmospheric pressure on the fetus.

384
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:05,259
This pressure--

385
00:36:07,511 --> 00:36:11,140
which is at sea level
1 4.7 pounds per square inch--

386
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:14,018
can be reduced by as much as 50%.

387
00:36:14,101 --> 00:36:16,145
It was Dr. Giacobo Marciani...

388
00:36:16,228 --> 00:36:18,272
director of
the hospital's research institute...

389
00:36:18,356 --> 00:36:21,525
who first made public the results
of the test involving the new device.

390
00:36:22,318 --> 00:36:25,613
Although it is anticipated
that the price...

391
00:36:25,696 --> 00:36:27,615
in the early stages
of development, at least...

392
00:36:27,657 --> 00:36:32,286
will be prohibited--
prohibiti-- prohibitive--

393
00:36:32,328 --> 00:36:34,205
official comment
on the new device...

394
00:36:34,288 --> 00:36:36,832
has not yet been forthcoming
from the Vatican."

395
00:36:42,505 --> 00:36:44,006
Don't!

396
00:36:47,635 --> 00:36:49,220
You're crazy!

397
00:36:52,014 --> 00:36:54,892
No! Give me my sheet back! John!

398
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,230
Give me that!

399
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:07,822
I got you! You bastard!
Son of a bitch!

400
00:37:08,864 --> 00:37:10,825
Let go of me, you fuck!

401
00:37:13,327 --> 00:37:15,913
Help! No, not on the floor!

402
00:37:15,997 --> 00:37:18,457
Jesus, you!

403
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:20,918
Help! Put me down! Help!

404
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,840
You bastard!
Let go of me, you prick!

405
00:37:25,923 --> 00:37:28,384
Naughty, naughty.
I got neighbors.

406
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:31,262
- Son of a bitch!
- I got neighbors. Be quiet.

407
00:37:31,345 --> 00:37:36,350
Catch you in the act.
They'll bust your arms. I like you.

408
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:38,853
Me too.

409
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:48,571
I'm gonna knock the shit
out ofyou.

410
00:37:49,655 --> 00:37:50,865
Ouch!

411
00:37:56,037 --> 00:37:58,122
There he goes.

412
00:37:58,205 --> 00:37:59,916
One good deed a year.

413
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:01,918
I heard that.

414
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:33,926
- You dropped your newspaper.
- Who are you?.

415
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:37,805
"Horton.
4444 North Clifton."

416
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:40,516
I think this belongs
to your little brother.

417
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,227
I don't have a brother.
It belongs to my son.

418
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:47,732
Mr. Horton go for green beans?.

419
00:39:58,868 --> 00:40:01,787
- Man.
- Not on the car.

420
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:04,790
Not on the car.
Come on. Get off the car.

421
00:40:04,874 --> 00:40:08,002
Come on. Off the car.
Come on.

422
00:40:09,587 --> 00:40:12,924
Get out of there.
Come on.

423
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:22,141
Come on. Out of the car.

424
00:40:22,224 --> 00:40:24,268
This is an official car.
Come on.

425
00:40:25,353 --> 00:40:30,024
- All those kids out there yours?.
- No. They belong to my neighbors.

426
00:40:30,066 --> 00:40:33,194
- Are you from the mountains?.
- West Virginia.

427
00:40:33,277 --> 00:40:35,571
- Just spent three weeks there.
- You did?.

428
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:41,202
We sure starve a lot
when the stamps run out.

429
00:40:41,244 --> 00:40:44,580
Trouble is, you can't
get no "tobaccy" on stamps.

430
00:40:44,664 --> 00:40:46,582
So you know about the stamps.

431
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:50,586
No, not really. I did this documentary.
Those words are on a tape.

432
00:41:07,061 --> 00:41:09,438
Hello, Marian, this is Gus.

433
00:41:09,522 --> 00:41:12,942
Page Katselas on number 51 2.

434
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:15,570
Have him report
to the wagon immediately.

435
00:41:15,653 --> 00:41:17,196
Ten-four. Ten-four.

436
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,032
I could've let the bird go.
He would've flown back...

437
00:41:20,116 --> 00:41:22,785
but I don't know how he would've
carried the basket.

438
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:25,121
It might've flown back
to West Virginia.

439
00:41:25,204 --> 00:41:27,999
Harold spends all his time
trying to retrain him.

440
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:30,459
- How long you been up here?.
- Not too long.

441
00:41:34,338 --> 00:41:38,259
- John, call the office.
- You got a telephone around here?.

442
00:41:38,301 --> 00:41:39,969
In the hall.

443
00:41:54,233 --> 00:41:56,152
Katselas here.

444
00:41:57,486 --> 00:42:00,323
Yeah, but he's right outsi--

445
00:42:00,406 --> 00:42:03,576
He did, huh?. Yeah, all right.

446
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:05,786
Anything else?.

447
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,122
All right. Thankyou.

448
00:42:13,502 --> 00:42:18,382
You tell Harold the bad guy from
the parking lot brought his bird back.

449
00:42:20,259 --> 00:42:23,471
- You tell him. Hear?.
- I will.

450
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:34,815
You mind turning this off?.

451
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:39,695
We're gonna make sound.
Would you shut this off?.

452
00:42:39,779 --> 00:42:42,198
- Shut it off!
- All right.

453
00:42:44,867 --> 00:42:47,828
Where was the money really located?.

454
00:42:47,912 --> 00:42:49,914
Was it stuffed in the seat?.

455
00:42:49,997 --> 00:42:52,375
It was in an envelope
on the floor.

456
00:42:52,416 --> 00:42:54,377
What kind of envelope?.

457
00:42:56,504 --> 00:42:58,506
What kind of an envelope was it?.

458
00:42:58,589 --> 00:43:00,800
Ask him.
He's counting the money there.

459
00:43:00,883 --> 00:43:04,011
He's counting the money.
How much money is it?.

460
00:43:04,095 --> 00:43:06,639
- How much money is it?.
- Don't ask him.

461
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:09,058
I want to know from you.
How much money did you have?.

462
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:12,103
How much did you count?.
Did you count the money?.

463
00:43:12,186 --> 00:43:14,939
- $1 0,000.
- You sure it was $1 0,000?.

464
00:43:15,022 --> 00:43:17,608
It wasn't 9,000?. Wasn't 1 1,000?.

465
00:43:17,692 --> 00:43:20,528
9,000?. $1 0,000, right?.

466
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:24,574
It was 9,000. I put 1,000 of mine
to make it 1 0,000.

467
00:43:24,657 --> 00:43:26,450
What you gonna do?.
Get funny now?.

468
00:43:26,534 --> 00:43:29,537
Gonna start putting me on?.
Let's not play games with each other.

469
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:34,542
I'm here to find out why you
turned in $1 0,000. Where did you get it?.

470
00:43:34,584 --> 00:43:38,337
Aren't you thankful
I did turn in $1 0,000?.

471
00:43:38,421 --> 00:43:41,632
Maybe not. I'm a policeman.
I'm just here to find out the facts.

472
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:40,399
Just tell her we coverthe news.
We do not manufacture violence.

473
00:44:40,483 --> 00:44:42,443
Talk to her, okay?.

474
00:44:44,987 --> 00:44:48,574
Mrs. Harris, I'm re-- Well?.

475
00:44:48,699 --> 00:44:51,077
Remember the shot of the cabby
who turned the money in?.

476
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,788
- Forget it.
- There's a story there, Carlin.

477
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:57,458
A lot of people are interested.
I think it'll go on the Sunday reports.

478
00:44:57,541 --> 00:45:00,878
No. I got a convention
coming up, a war...

479
00:45:00,962 --> 00:45:03,965
I got baseball,
a nervous city...

480
00:45:04,048 --> 00:45:06,634
plus I got chickenshit cameramen
that are afraid...

481
00:45:06,717 --> 00:45:09,178
to go into the ghetto
without police protection.

482
00:45:09,262 --> 00:45:13,349
No. Stay out
of those neighborhoods...

483
00:45:13,432 --> 00:45:14,809
until I send you in there.

484
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:17,561
- I want film and lab.
- They got film.

485
00:45:17,645 --> 00:45:22,024
- I want film and lab.
- Would you please stop bothering me?.

486
00:45:22,066 --> 00:45:25,361
Mr. Evans's office on line six.

487
00:45:25,444 --> 00:45:29,865
Write up a voucher.
Yes, sir. Good morning.

488
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:33,869
Hey, TV man.
Are we gonna be on TV?.

489
00:45:33,953 --> 00:45:36,664
We wanna be on TV.

490
00:45:36,706 --> 00:45:40,918
- TV, that's for us.
- Hey, TV man! What's happening?.

491
00:45:41,002 --> 00:45:44,880
...slaughtered Philadelphia 9-0.

492
00:45:44,922 --> 00:45:48,217
And finally, it was the Mets
walloping the Pirates.

493
00:45:52,555 --> 00:45:54,056
- Locked?.
- Yeah.

494
00:45:55,725 --> 00:45:59,020
-You know you're two blocks away?.
-I had some trouble in there last ni ght.

495
00:45:59,061 --> 00:46:01,022
Thought we'd keep the equipment safe.

496
00:46:04,483 --> 00:46:06,694
White bread on sandwiches
is not too cool.

497
00:46:06,736 --> 00:46:11,699
- Come on, now.
- No. That's out of it. O-U-T. Out.

498
00:46:11,741 --> 00:46:14,744
I don't think we have any other kind,
but I'll take a look-see.

499
00:46:15,953 --> 00:46:19,540
Frank, I dug your name
in the paper.

500
00:46:19,582 --> 00:46:23,753
You're somewhat of a celebrity now.
Want to fill me in?.

501
00:46:23,836 --> 00:46:25,504
Well, I'm not
really a celebrity...

502
00:46:25,588 --> 00:46:30,801
but, yeah, I found the bread,
and I turned it in.

503
00:46:30,885 --> 00:46:32,428
- You turned it in.
- Uh-huh.

504
00:46:32,511 --> 00:46:35,598
Were you acting as a Negro
or a black man?.

505
00:46:35,681 --> 00:46:37,725
I'm concerned about this.

506
00:46:37,808 --> 00:46:39,894
What do you mean, was I acting
as a Negro or black man?.

507
00:46:39,977 --> 00:46:43,648
Ifyou were acting as a black man,
you would've kept the money.

508
00:46:43,731 --> 00:46:47,443
Ifyou were acting as a Negro,
you turned it in.

509
00:46:47,526 --> 00:46:51,239
You're my man.
You're my man and everything.

510
00:46:51,322 --> 00:46:54,492
- How much money was that?.
- $1 0,000.

511
00:46:54,575 --> 00:46:57,161
$1 0,000?. You kidding?.

512
00:46:57,954 --> 00:46:59,997
Dig, now, look. You know--

513
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:04,377
Do you realize
how much ammunition and guns...

514
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,713
$1 0,000 would've bought?.

515
00:47:07,797 --> 00:47:09,966
Well, I'm not quite there yet.

516
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:13,970
But I'm talking about,
you got to be alive to be honest.

517
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:18,349
- Whatyou doing around here, man?
- Just buying some cigarettes.

518
00:47:18,432 --> 00:47:21,936
You ain't got no right coming here
to buy no cigarettes.

519
00:47:24,772 --> 00:47:28,734
Guys like you get shot all up,
you know?.

520
00:47:28,818 --> 00:47:32,154
-Yeah.
-Don't come here for cigarettes.

521
00:47:32,238 --> 00:47:34,156
You know what I mean?.

522
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:18,910
We have a visitor.

523
00:48:20,995 --> 00:48:23,831
- Frank Baker live here?.
- Frank Baker live here?.

524
00:48:23,873 --> 00:48:27,251
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?.
- Frank Baker, cabdriver?.

525
00:48:27,335 --> 00:48:29,921
- Does he live here?.
- Does he live here?.

526
00:48:30,004 --> 00:48:33,299
- Yeah. Does he live here?.
- Does he live here?.

527
00:48:33,382 --> 00:48:35,718
There's no Frank cabdriver here.

528
00:48:38,721 --> 00:48:43,851
You don't know him?. He's a cabdriver.
I did a story on him. I'm a reporter.

529
00:48:43,935 --> 00:48:46,395
- What's his name again?.
- Frank Baker.

530
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:49,649
- Frank Baker.
- Come on. You're putting the guy on.

531
00:48:49,732 --> 00:48:52,109
This is the guy
who put me on television.

532
00:48:52,193 --> 00:48:54,695
- How you doing?.
- Very well. I don't want to bust in.

533
00:48:54,737 --> 00:48:57,323
I just wondered
ifyou got five minutes to talk.

534
00:48:58,574 --> 00:49:00,785
- Let's do it over a drink.
- Good.

535
00:49:09,335 --> 00:49:12,588
You know, Chicago cops...

536
00:49:12,672 --> 00:49:15,216
are getting
funnier-looking every day.

537
00:49:18,427 --> 00:49:21,639
- I'm not a cop. I'm a soundman.
- Bet you got credentials too.

538
00:49:21,722 --> 00:49:25,101
The FBI supplies
the best credentials.

539
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:28,771
We know
that one of the best ways...

540
00:49:28,813 --> 00:49:32,400
for spying on black people
is to impersonate TV men.

541
00:49:32,483 --> 00:49:34,652
We're talking to Frank
about doing a story.

542
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:37,405
- Yeah?. What's that?.
- That's my Pageboy.

543
00:49:38,906 --> 00:49:41,951
- Your Pageboy?.
- Yeah.

544
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:47,039
Hey, Richard,
come and dig this cat's Pageboy.

545
00:49:48,124 --> 00:49:52,086
Now, what do you do
with "my Pageboy"?.

546
00:49:52,128 --> 00:49:53,879
Well, I don't do anything.
It just hangs there.

547
00:49:53,963 --> 00:49:57,925
If they want me to go someplace
or do something, they call me on it.

548
00:49:58,009 --> 00:50:03,014
You mean,
they give you orders on this.

549
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:05,016
Yeah.

550
00:50:07,977 --> 00:50:12,189
Man, you mean to tell me they talk
to you, and you can't talk back?.

551
00:50:13,357 --> 00:50:16,360
He means he's a receiver
and not a sender.

552
00:50:18,529 --> 00:50:21,157
Looks like they're
calling you now.

553
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:23,159
What, you a white flunky
or something?.

554
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,954
Wrong. You got a bad idea about--

555
00:50:26,996 --> 00:50:29,832
I forgot something downstairs.
I'll meet you in the car.

556
00:50:29,916 --> 00:50:31,459
All right.

557
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,253
Coming back.
He's coming back.

558
00:50:34,337 --> 00:50:37,173
There he goes.
There he goes.

559
00:50:37,214 --> 00:50:39,175
A honky flunky.

560
00:50:41,302 --> 00:50:43,638
Look, man,
I've been on television...

561
00:50:43,679 --> 00:50:47,642
I've been in the newspapers,
and it's made my life total confusion.

562
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:52,188
I find $1 0,000 in a cab.
I'm boob enough to turn it in...

563
00:50:52,229 --> 00:50:54,607
and I get my butt kicked
by everybody in the world.

564
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:57,860
- No, man.
- That's just it, Frank.

565
00:50:57,944 --> 00:51:01,364
It's a human interest story.
People identify.

566
00:51:01,447 --> 00:51:03,658
- It'll be constructive.
- Are you coming, Frank?.

567
00:51:03,741 --> 00:51:06,619
I'll give you a call, and
we'll have another talk about it.

568
00:51:06,702 --> 00:51:08,037
Thankyou.

569
00:51:09,163 --> 00:51:12,708
Excuse me, TV man, you wanted
someone for an interview, right?.

570
00:51:12,792 --> 00:51:14,585
I haven't got time
right now, dear. I gotta run.

571
00:51:14,669 --> 00:51:17,672
But I wanted to talk to you.
See, I'm a black actress.

572
00:51:17,755 --> 00:51:20,841
- Listen, honey-- I haven't got time--
- Don't "honey" me.

573
00:51:20,925 --> 00:51:25,096
I'm a black actress.
I demand respect. I'm not looking for--

574
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:29,433
- You call the station.
- No. You said you wanted somebody.

575
00:51:29,517 --> 00:51:32,561
You want to hear-- know what's
going on, what black people are doing?.

576
00:51:32,645 --> 00:51:35,231
- I'm not interested.
- Wait, wait.

577
00:51:35,314 --> 00:51:39,402
- Don't "honey" me.
- You got to start respecting our women.

578
00:51:39,485 --> 00:51:43,531
I have no disrespect in mind.
I gotta leave. I don't have time.

579
00:51:43,614 --> 00:51:46,200
I want to talk to you
about what I'd like to do.

580
00:51:46,284 --> 00:51:50,788
You people are always busy
putting your kind of people on.

581
00:51:50,871 --> 00:51:53,124
I want to talk to you
about what I want.

582
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:56,127
- Listen, dear.
- I told you about that "dear."

583
00:51:56,210 --> 00:51:59,714
- I'm trying to be very respectful.
- We demand--

584
00:51:59,797 --> 00:52:02,592
- You demand what?.
- Demand respect.

585
00:52:05,636 --> 00:52:07,263
- Handle it.
- I'll try.

586
00:52:07,346 --> 00:52:11,475
- Don't call me "honey."
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

587
00:52:11,559 --> 00:52:15,396
-This is the guy that came by the house.
-I know the guy.

588
00:52:15,479 --> 00:52:18,649
So don't give him a bad time.

589
00:52:18,733 --> 00:52:20,318
Leave him alone.
He's all right.

590
00:52:20,401 --> 00:52:22,778
- Come on, baby.
- He's a jive--

591
00:52:22,862 --> 00:52:27,575
Wait a minute.
I want to talk to you. Come in.

592
00:52:27,658 --> 00:52:30,286
Let me askyou something.
Are you being friendly?.

593
00:52:30,328 --> 00:52:34,123
Am I being friendly?.
I just saved your life.

594
00:52:34,206 --> 00:52:36,959
- If I got to be afraid--
- You understand I just saved your life?.

595
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:41,339
If I got to be afraid foryour argument
to work, you got no argument.

596
00:52:41,422 --> 00:52:44,592
I want you to understand
I saved your life.

597
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:48,971
You came down here to do some sort
of jive interview.

598
00:52:49,013 --> 00:52:54,143
You did that. Came down here with
1 5 minutes of a black sensibility...

599
00:52:54,226 --> 00:52:56,354
and so you don't understand that.

600
00:52:56,437 --> 00:52:58,147
You came down here
to shoot 1 5 minutes...

601
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:01,150
ofwhat has taken 300 years
to develop.

602
00:53:01,192 --> 00:53:03,402
- Grief, you know?.
- I'm not interested in grief--

603
00:53:03,486 --> 00:53:07,657
All we're trying to explain to you
is that you don't understand.

604
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,409
I do something.
I do it well. That's my job.

605
00:53:10,493 --> 00:53:15,122
You don't do it black enough. You can't,
because you're not black. We are.

606
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:19,168
When you come and say you've come
to do something of human interest...

607
00:53:19,252 --> 00:53:22,672
it makes a person wonder whether
you're going to do something...

608
00:53:22,713 --> 00:53:26,926
of interest to other humans, or whether
you consider the person human...

609
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:28,844
in whom you're interested.

610
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:31,931
You have
to understand that too.

611
00:53:32,014 --> 00:53:35,726
You can't just walk in
out ofyour arrogance...

612
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:38,312
and expect things
to be like they are...

613
00:53:38,396 --> 00:53:40,982
because when you walked in,
you brought La Salle Street with you...

614
00:53:41,065 --> 00:53:45,611
City Hall and all
the mass communications media.

615
00:53:45,695 --> 00:53:49,448
And you are the exploiters.
You're the ones who distort...

616
00:53:49,532 --> 00:53:55,037
and ridicule and emasculate us,
and that ain't cool.

617
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:58,374
You don't want to know, man.
You don't know the people.

618
00:53:58,457 --> 00:54:00,710
You don't show the people.

619
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:03,421
Here's some cat
who's down and out, you dig?.

620
00:54:03,504 --> 00:54:05,965
He's nobody,
so he says to his old man...

621
00:54:06,048 --> 00:54:09,635
"I'm nobody. I'm gonna die,

622
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:12,179
and ain't nobody
gonna know I lived," dig?.

623
00:54:12,263 --> 00:54:16,350
So the cat finds a brick and
throws it through Charlie's window...

624
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:19,645
or he takes a gun
and he shoots.

625
00:54:19,729 --> 00:54:23,024
Then the cat lives, man.
He really lives, dig?.

626
00:54:23,107 --> 00:54:25,943
A hundred million people
see the cat on the tube.

627
00:54:26,027 --> 00:54:28,696
They say,
"The former invisible man lives."

628
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:33,117
Everybody knows about his wife
and kids-- everything, you dig?.

629
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,955
'Cause the tube is life, man. Life.

630
00:54:38,039 --> 00:54:42,460
You make him an Emmy, man.
You make him the TV star of the hour...

631
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:46,464
on the 6:00, the 1 0:00
and the 1 2:00 news.

632
00:54:46,505 --> 00:54:48,799
'Cause what the cat is saying
is truth, man.

633
00:54:48,883 --> 00:54:52,511
Why don't you find out
what really is?.

634
00:54:52,595 --> 00:54:54,639
Why you always got to wait
till somebody gets killed?.

635
00:54:54,722 --> 00:54:56,515
'Cause somebody is gonna get killed.

636
00:55:18,079 --> 00:55:20,081
Is that thing loaded?.

637
00:55:20,164 --> 00:55:21,666
As a matter of fact,
they call it a shotgun.

638
00:55:21,749 --> 00:55:23,751
It looks about 1 2-gauge.

639
00:55:26,087 --> 00:55:28,214
- Let's go over here.
- Okay.

640
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:33,135
There's a good background.
Very good.

641
00:55:33,177 --> 00:55:35,471
- We can't shoot here.
- What do you mean?.

642
00:55:35,513 --> 00:55:37,807
Too noisy.
Those gunshots will wipe us out.

643
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:42,270
It's always too noisy, isn't it?.
Let's go back over here.

644
00:55:42,353 --> 00:55:45,064
- Good for you?.
- Yeah, fine.

645
00:55:46,148 --> 00:55:48,734
- Pepsi machine. Good enough?.
- Fine.

646
00:55:48,818 --> 00:55:50,695
Excuse me.

647
00:55:50,778 --> 00:55:54,198
- What do I do now?.
- Just speak in a normal tone ofvoice.

648
00:55:54,282 --> 00:55:56,576
Rolling here. Rolling.

649
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:59,745
Well, there's been
about a 46% increase...

650
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:02,373
in pistol registration
since last year's riot.

651
00:56:02,456 --> 00:56:04,375
We're getting our business
from people...

652
00:56:04,458 --> 00:56:07,420
who want to
protect their families and homes.

653
00:56:07,503 --> 00:56:09,547
- Can you hold on a minute?.
- Excuse me.

654
00:56:09,630 --> 00:56:12,550
- The damn thing's stuck.
- Point that down.

655
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:16,262
I've only got one head.
There we go. See?. This release.

656
00:56:16,345 --> 00:56:17,805
There. Okay?.

657
00:56:19,223 --> 00:56:21,475
- Thankyou.
- There you go.

658
00:56:23,227 --> 00:56:26,147
- Not bad.
- You ready again?.

659
00:56:26,230 --> 00:56:28,190
You want to start again?.

660
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:31,777
Well, I don't know
what you're looking for.

661
00:56:31,861 --> 00:56:34,155
If a person
has a driver's license...

662
00:56:34,238 --> 00:56:36,824
he has to know how to drive.

663
00:56:36,908 --> 00:56:41,203
If a person gets a gun,
he has to know how to use it.

664
00:56:41,287 --> 00:56:46,125
How he uses it or what he uses it for
is a personal right.

665
00:56:49,754 --> 00:56:50,713
Sorry.

666
00:56:50,755 --> 00:56:53,132
- Dick, let me have a dime.
- Sure, John.

667
00:56:56,719 --> 00:56:59,138
There you go.

668
00:56:59,221 --> 00:57:02,892
I asked him where he was.
He said, "I was on vacation."

669
00:57:02,934 --> 00:57:04,644
Hey, loverboy.

670
00:57:04,727 --> 00:57:06,687
Dede's looking foryou.

671
00:57:19,450 --> 00:57:21,702
- Looking for me?.
- Johnny.

672
00:57:22,787 --> 00:57:26,040
- There might be a little problem.
- What is it?.

673
00:57:26,123 --> 00:57:29,585
Carlin came around yesterday
kind of mad.

674
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:31,754
Tell me something new.

675
00:57:31,837 --> 00:57:36,425
Johnny, you know the outtakes
for that footage?.

676
00:57:36,467 --> 00:57:39,262
- You know, the draft-card burners?.
- Yeah.

677
00:57:39,345 --> 00:57:41,347
Did you give that
to the light show kids?.

678
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:44,600
For Christ's sakes, don't be cute.
What the hell did he say?.

679
00:57:44,642 --> 00:57:47,019
He didn't say anything
definite really.

680
00:57:47,103 --> 00:57:50,439
He just complained about you
being out when he needed you...

681
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:53,526
and screwing around,
shooting stupid interviews.

682
00:57:53,609 --> 00:57:57,446
What the hell is up?.
Don't tell me what you think.

683
00:57:57,488 --> 00:57:59,782
Just tell me what kind
of shit's flying around.

684
00:57:59,824 --> 00:58:01,867
Jesus, let go.

685
00:58:05,997 --> 00:58:08,207
I'll tell you.

686
00:58:12,378 --> 00:58:16,632
Well, for about a year now...

687
00:58:16,674 --> 00:58:22,305
the station's been letting
the cops and the FBI...

688
00:58:22,388 --> 00:58:24,724
study our footage.

689
00:58:26,434 --> 00:58:32,189
You're putting me on.
You're kidding me. What am I, a fink?.

690
00:58:32,273 --> 00:58:34,525
How can I go out
and cover a story?.

691
00:58:34,609 --> 00:58:37,361
It's a wonder more cameras
haven't been smashed.

692
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:39,822
I want to know why nobody told me
what the hell's been going on...

693
00:58:39,864 --> 00:58:42,992
because you can bet
in the streets, they know.

694
00:58:43,075 --> 00:58:45,328
You should've told me, Dede.

695
00:58:49,373 --> 00:58:51,459
- Just a sec, will you?.
- Is he here?. Where is he?.

696
00:58:51,542 --> 00:58:53,628
I want to see him.

697
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:57,381
He won't be in this morning.
This is foryou.

698
00:59:02,929 --> 00:59:07,141
Where the hell is he?.
Why won't he be in?.

699
00:59:07,224 --> 00:59:09,435
What the hell is this crap?.

700
00:59:34,043 --> 00:59:38,673
I don't know what day
it plays. Wha--

701
00:59:38,756 --> 00:59:41,801
That was a business call.

702
00:59:43,636 --> 00:59:44,553
Accounting.

703
00:59:44,637 --> 00:59:47,098
Did you get a severance notice
for John Katselas?.

704
00:59:47,181 --> 00:59:49,475
Just a minute.

705
00:59:51,394 --> 00:59:53,062
Yes, I have it here.
Who's calling?

706
00:59:57,149 --> 01:00:00,236
I'd tell them to
stuff their lousy job in a minute.

707
01:00:00,319 --> 01:00:02,780
Well, you know that. I would.

708
01:00:04,949 --> 01:00:06,826
I would.

709
01:00:06,909 --> 01:00:10,371
As far as I'm concerned,
I'm with you, John.

710
01:00:10,454 --> 01:00:13,499
I'll tell the bastards,
"IfJohn goes, then I walkwith him."

711
01:00:18,546 --> 01:00:20,506
Well, I gotta get moving.

712
01:00:22,049 --> 01:00:23,968
Take it easy, Gus.

713
01:00:46,574 --> 01:00:48,159
Remember me?.

714
01:00:54,498 --> 01:00:56,375
Yeah.

715
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:58,836
Yeah, I almost didn't
recognize you in that outfit.

716
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,505
I work over there at Motorola.

717
01:01:05,051 --> 01:01:06,636
Well...

718
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:08,888
it's been good seeing you.

719
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:14,268
How's the pigeon boy doing?.

720
01:01:14,352 --> 01:01:16,228
Real good.Just fine.

721
01:01:17,563 --> 01:01:21,025
- You always eat here?.
- It's pretty bad, isn't it?.

722
01:01:21,108 --> 01:01:23,027
Most times I bring my own.

723
01:01:27,323 --> 01:01:29,242
Where you headed?.

724
01:01:34,288 --> 01:01:36,249
Did you finish your salad?.

725
01:01:36,290 --> 01:01:38,251
You want some of mine?.

726
01:01:38,292 --> 01:01:39,752
Sure?.

727
01:01:44,382 --> 01:01:45,841
What's the matter?.

728
01:01:47,176 --> 01:01:49,929
Maybe it's just that
he's not used to company, huh?.

729
01:01:55,476 --> 01:01:57,395
What'd you do back home?.

730
01:01:57,478 --> 01:01:59,689
I was a schoolteacher.

731
01:01:59,772 --> 01:02:02,233
You were?.
Why aren't you teaching here?.

732
01:02:02,316 --> 01:02:04,235
Things are very different up here.

733
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:08,531
Down home I taught five grades
in one room for one thing.

734
01:02:08,614 --> 01:02:10,032
Wow.

735
01:02:10,116 --> 01:02:12,118
Like the little red schoolhouse.

736
01:02:12,201 --> 01:02:14,870
Kind of. But...

737
01:02:14,954 --> 01:02:19,083
see, they don't recognize me
as a teacher up here.

738
01:02:19,166 --> 01:02:23,087
The education that I had down home
isn't good enough for them...

739
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,631
for me to teach here, so I can't.

740
01:02:25,673 --> 01:02:28,801
But I'll tell you,
I don't think I'd want to anyway.

741
01:02:28,884 --> 01:02:31,012
I wouldn't want to teach
in the schools in this neighborhood.

742
01:02:31,095 --> 01:02:34,181
- Why not?.
- They don't teach you nothing.

743
01:02:34,265 --> 01:02:36,976
It's a Chicago school.
They got to teach you something.

744
01:02:37,018 --> 01:02:42,023
They don't.
They run a television in there.

745
01:02:42,106 --> 01:02:44,025
Well, they use TV these days.

746
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:46,027
They use educational--

747
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:48,321
Yeah, but not that kind ofTV.

748
01:02:48,362 --> 01:02:52,533
You watch anything you want.
They don't try--

749
01:02:52,617 --> 01:02:54,535
When you ask them to--

750
01:02:54,619 --> 01:02:56,537
that you want to do some work...

751
01:02:56,621 --> 01:02:59,415
they say,
"No, you do what I tell you."

752
01:02:59,498 --> 01:03:01,959
- They let you watch TV, is that it?.
- Yeah, that's all.

753
01:03:02,043 --> 01:03:05,671
- They don't do nothing else.
- Don't you like TV?.

754
01:03:05,755 --> 01:03:07,673
Yeah, but--

755
01:03:07,757 --> 01:03:09,800
You're probably doing
what you like.

756
01:03:09,884 --> 01:03:13,095
- Where you from?.
- Right here. Chicago.

757
01:03:13,179 --> 01:03:17,224
C.Y.O. welterweight boxer, 1 958.

758
01:03:18,434 --> 01:03:21,145
You ever boxed?. Or do you
just wrestle when you fight?.

759
01:03:21,228 --> 01:03:24,190
People down here use sticks,
rocks...

760
01:03:24,273 --> 01:03:27,193
guns, and everything
down here in here.

761
01:03:27,235 --> 01:03:29,737
- Nah, you don't use rocks, do you?.
- Yeah.

762
01:03:29,820 --> 01:03:31,739
I don't. They do.

763
01:03:31,822 --> 01:03:35,826
- Only dirty fighters use rocks.
- And guns and sticks.

764
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:37,620
You got a gun?.

765
01:03:37,703 --> 01:03:39,538
Play gun?.

766
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:42,291
That's good.

767
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:45,836
I shot a gun when I was eight--
I mean, ten years old.

768
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,091
- Where?.
- West Virginia.

769
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:52,885
I'll take him with me
to C.Y.O. maybe...

770
01:03:52,969 --> 01:03:56,013
and let him hit the bag.

771
01:04:03,688 --> 01:04:05,314
Can I watch TV?.

772
01:04:05,398 --> 01:04:09,026
Help me put the plates in the sink,
and then you can go watch TV.

773
01:04:12,280 --> 01:04:14,240
I'll give you a hand here.

774
01:04:19,579 --> 01:04:21,497
Is your bird okay?.

775
01:04:23,165 --> 01:04:25,876
The other day, I thought you were
stealing something off my car.

776
01:04:25,960 --> 01:04:27,962
I don't steal!

777
01:04:28,045 --> 01:04:31,549
Anyway, what's so great
about your shitty car?.

778
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:33,926
I brought your bird back, didn't I?.

779
01:04:36,512 --> 01:04:39,015
Anyway, it's not my car.

780
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:50,276
Beverly Hillbillies,
normally scheduled forthis time...

781
01:04:50,318 --> 01:04:51,903
will not be seen tonight.

782
01:04:51,986 --> 01:04:54,614
Instead, we bringyou the third part
ofa network special...

783
01:04:54,655 --> 01:04:57,325
on John F. Kennedy,
Martin L uther King...

784
01:04:57,408 --> 01:04:59,035
and Robert Kennedy.

785
01:05:18,554 --> 01:05:20,473
Why'd they fire you?.

786
01:05:20,556 --> 01:05:22,642
Can you get another job?.

787
01:05:22,725 --> 01:05:26,145
Can you get welfare?.
I mean, unemployment?.

788
01:05:27,313 --> 01:05:29,231
Do I look worried?.

789
01:05:31,359 --> 01:05:35,279
Too many questions.
Why they canned me?.

790
01:05:35,363 --> 01:05:37,573
I'm not sure I know the answer.

791
01:05:39,825 --> 01:05:42,662
I started a story about a cabdriver
who found all that cash...

792
01:05:42,703 --> 01:05:46,999
somebody lost and,
for unknown reasons, wouldn't claim.

793
01:05:47,083 --> 01:05:48,334
Why?.

794
01:05:48,417 --> 01:05:51,003
There's only one kind of money
a guy would be afraid to claim.

795
01:05:51,087 --> 01:05:53,130
I had some idea maybe
there was a connection...

796
01:05:53,214 --> 01:05:55,174
between guns, vigilante groups...

797
01:05:55,216 --> 01:05:58,344
maybe getting ready
for a blowup this summer, you know?.

798
01:05:58,427 --> 01:06:02,431
Then I got sort of sidetracked--
interested, so to speak.

799
01:06:02,515 --> 01:06:04,934
But nobody said anything about this.

800
01:06:05,017 --> 01:06:07,186
My director just told
my union local...

801
01:06:07,228 --> 01:06:10,523
I had taken company film
without authorization.

802
01:06:10,606 --> 01:06:12,858
You see,
it gets pretty complicated.

803
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:15,778
People rarely say
the real reasons for things.

804
01:06:15,861 --> 01:06:17,863
Big corporations never do.

805
01:06:18,948 --> 01:06:20,866
Just politics...

806
01:06:20,950 --> 01:06:24,537
plain bureaucratic politics.

807
01:06:24,620 --> 01:06:27,248
I guess it's the season up here.

808
01:06:27,331 --> 01:06:30,167
Anyway, we only been
in Chicago a little while...

809
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:32,545
not even long enough
for me to vote.

810
01:06:36,007 --> 01:06:39,552
Come on. Tell me how you managed to
teach five grades in one classroom.

811
01:06:40,928 --> 01:06:44,390
I didn't manage.
One thing I did was--

812
01:06:44,473 --> 01:06:47,018
Well, I just had three
in the third grade...

813
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:49,270
so I put one boy up to fourth...

814
01:06:49,353 --> 01:06:51,439
and a boy and girl back to second.

815
01:06:51,522 --> 01:06:53,899
That way I only had four grades.

816
01:06:54,984 --> 01:06:57,528
Is that the new math?.

817
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:29,977
Gather with the saints at the river

818
01:07:30,061 --> 01:07:34,732
That flows by the throne ofGod

819
01:07:35,816 --> 01:07:40,738
Shall we gather at the river

820
01:07:40,821 --> 01:07:45,952
Where bright Angel's feet have trod

821
01:07:46,035 --> 01:07:50,831
With these Christians at the river

822
01:07:50,957 --> 01:07:55,294
That flows by the throne of God

823
01:07:56,629 --> 01:08:01,592
Yes, we shall gather at the river

824
01:08:01,676 --> 01:08:07,056
The beautiful, beautiful river

825
01:08:07,139 --> 01:08:11,727
Gather with the saints at the river

826
01:08:11,811 --> 01:08:16,440
That flows by the throne of God

827
01:08:17,483 --> 01:08:22,697
Yes, we shall gather at the river

828
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:28,244
The beautiful, beautiful river

829
01:08:28,327 --> 01:08:32,790
Gather with the saints at the river

830
01:08:32,832 --> 01:08:38,254
That flows by the throne of God

831
01:08:39,088 --> 01:08:42,174
Well, I don 't know
what will happen now.

832
01:08:42,258 --> 01:08:44,969
We've got some difficult
days ahead...

833
01:08:46,220 --> 01:08:48,681
but it doesn 't really matter
with me now...

834
01:08:48,764 --> 01:08:51,017
because I've been
to the mountaintop.

835
01:08:52,852 --> 01:08:54,770
I don 't mind.

836
01:08:57,773 --> 01:09:02,445
Like anybody,
I would like to live a long life.

837
01:09:02,528 --> 01:09:06,282
L ongevity has its place...

838
01:09:06,365 --> 01:09:09,702
but I'm not concerned
about that now.

839
01:09:09,744 --> 01:09:12,079
Ijust want to do God's will.

840
01:09:13,706 --> 01:09:16,042
And He's allowed me
to go up to the mountain.

841
01:09:16,125 --> 01:09:19,211
- Jesus, I love to shoot film.
- And I've looked over...

842
01:09:20,129 --> 01:09:22,423
and I've seen...

843
01:09:22,506 --> 01:09:24,884
the promised land.

844
01:09:24,926 --> 01:09:27,511
I may not get there with you...

845
01:09:27,595 --> 01:09:30,348
but I want you to know tonight...

846
01:09:30,389 --> 01:09:32,350
that we, as a people...

847
01:09:32,391 --> 01:09:34,894
will get to the promised land.

848
01:09:37,897 --> 01:09:39,857
Do you feel it?.

849
01:09:39,899 --> 01:09:41,859
X rays, is that what it is?.
Does it grow hair?.

850
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:44,070
Is it vitamins?.

851
01:09:44,153 --> 01:09:46,364
Can you feel violence?.

852
01:09:46,405 --> 01:09:48,658
I don't know what to think.

853
01:09:48,741 --> 01:09:52,453
It seems like no man's life
is worth anything anymore.

854
01:09:55,414 --> 01:09:57,541
You see...

855
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:59,585
the media's got a script now...

856
01:09:59,627 --> 01:10:01,504
by the numbers.

857
01:10:01,587 --> 01:10:04,715
Flags at half-mast.
Trips canceled.

858
01:10:04,757 --> 01:10:06,842
Ball games called off.
Schools closed.

859
01:10:06,926 --> 01:10:08,886
Flags at half-mast.

860
01:10:09,929 --> 01:10:12,348
Memorial meetings.
Memorial marches.

861
01:10:12,431 --> 01:10:14,392
Moments of silence.

862
01:10:15,601 --> 01:10:17,937
A widow cries,
and then she says brave words.

863
01:10:17,979 --> 01:10:19,939
- More moments of silence...
- Standing by...

864
01:10:19,981 --> 01:10:22,733
- in our Washington studio is...
- then the funeral procession.

865
01:10:22,817 --> 01:10:25,945
a foremost expert on urban violence
on the contemporary scene.

866
01:10:26,028 --> 01:10:28,573
A lot of experts...

867
01:10:28,656 --> 01:10:32,243
saying how sick our society is,
how sick we all are.

868
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:36,622
The script is a national drain-off.

869
01:10:38,207 --> 01:10:42,295
People say, "Yeah, yeah,
we're guilty. We're bad."

870
01:10:42,378 --> 01:10:44,797
'Cause a lot of people are afraid.
They're afraid...

871
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:48,134
the Negroes are going to tear up
their stores, burn neighborhoods...

872
01:10:48,217 --> 01:10:50,428
so they have this nationwide...

873
01:10:50,511 --> 01:10:54,599
coast-to-coast network special
called "Mourn the Martyr."

874
01:10:54,640 --> 01:10:56,976
Nobody's really
on the hook, you see?.

875
01:10:57,059 --> 01:11:00,396
Traditionally, religion
has supplied the moral backstop.

876
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:04,525
When the script is finished
and Tuesday comes around...

877
01:11:04,609 --> 01:11:07,528
or Saturday and...

878
01:11:07,612 --> 01:11:10,114
National Drain-Off Week is over...

879
01:11:11,866 --> 01:11:14,410
everybody goes pretty much
back to normal.

880
01:11:15,494 --> 01:11:17,538
Normal this, normal that.

881
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:20,416
You know, normal.

882
01:11:20,499 --> 01:11:23,628
We will be able
to speed up that day...

883
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:25,796
when all ofGod's children--

884
01:11:25,880 --> 01:11:27,965
black men and white men...

885
01:11:28,007 --> 01:11:29,967
Jews and gentiles...

886
01:11:30,009 --> 01:11:31,969
Protestants and Catholics--

887
01:11:32,011 --> 01:11:34,138
will be able to join hands...

888
01:11:34,221 --> 01:11:37,767
and sing in the words
ofthe old Negro spiritual--

889
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:40,811
Free at last! Free at last!

890
01:11:40,853 --> 01:11:44,315
Thank God Almighty,
we are free at last!

891
01:11:47,443 --> 01:11:49,362
Goose bumps.

892
01:11:50,446 --> 01:11:53,366
It reminds me
of church down home...

893
01:11:53,449 --> 01:11:55,743
sitting there with Clovis...

894
01:11:55,826 --> 01:11:58,829
and Grandma and Buddy.

895
01:11:58,913 --> 01:12:02,708
This program,
the third ofa series...

896
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:07,280
was brought to you as
a public service by station WHJP.

897
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,367
Stay tuned for the Late Show
next on Channel 8.

898
01:12:10,450 --> 01:12:13,286
I know your husband can't come
charging through the door.

899
01:12:13,328 --> 01:12:16,289
It'd be too corny,
like the Late Show.

900
01:12:20,794 --> 01:12:22,212
Buddy's dead.

901
01:12:22,295 --> 01:12:25,757
UnitedAirlines says,
"Come fly with me. "

902
01:12:25,799 --> 01:12:28,259
We make it easy foryou
to dojust that...

903
01:12:28,301 --> 01:12:31,429
with Discover America Fare
for vacation people.

904
01:12:31,513 --> 01:12:34,891
And foryoung people,
we have a great family plan...

905
01:12:34,975 --> 01:12:37,310
for families of all ages
and all sizes.

906
01:12:37,394 --> 01:12:38,979
- Well...
- So the next time...

907
01:12:39,062 --> 01:12:40,855
you andyour family
plan a vacation...

908
01:12:40,939 --> 01:12:43,858
it's raining like hell, and I'm
riding the C.T.A. these days.

909
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:46,903
- 1 :00's the last one.
- rememberto fly...

910
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:50,323
- the friendly skies ofUnited.
- Well, thanks.

911
01:12:51,741 --> 01:12:54,786
It's 1 1:30 on WHJP.

912
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:58,623
Harold must have me on his list.

913
01:12:58,665 --> 01:13:01,710
No, you're wrong.

914
01:13:01,793 --> 01:13:04,713
Once he speaks his mind,
he's clear.

915
01:13:10,635 --> 01:13:13,513
Tonight Channel 8 proudly
presents Brigitte Bardot...

916
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:15,140
- Wait!
- andJack Palance...

917
01:13:15,181 --> 01:13:19,686
in a film by the controversial
French director,Jean-L uc Godard.

918
01:13:19,769 --> 01:13:22,314
In a moment, Contempt.

919
01:13:25,984 --> 01:13:27,402
Here.

920
01:13:29,654 --> 01:13:32,282
Don't want you to get wet.

921
01:13:32,365 --> 01:13:33,950
I won't.

922
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:52,696
Come on, boy. Listen.

923
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:54,447
You know...

924
01:14:54,531 --> 01:14:57,325
there's a lot of things that you
don't understand about womenfolks...

925
01:14:57,409 --> 01:15:00,245
I want to talk to you about it,
ya hear?.

926
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:05,625
A man has got to be boss
of his home.

927
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:08,795
There ain't no two bosses in
the family because it ain't right.

928
01:15:08,878 --> 01:15:10,797
- You understand that?.
- Yeah.

929
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:13,925
The thing I'm trying to show you is
that women don't understand a man.

930
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,844
Your home is your castle.

931
01:15:15,927 --> 01:15:19,597
I don't care how bad
orwhere you live or what it is.

932
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:24,769
That's your castle, and that woman
was made foryou and belongs to you.

933
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,813
You don't belong to her,
but she belongs to you.

934
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:30,900
You twain become one flesh,
and that flesh is you.

935
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:33,236
She belongs to you, you understand?.

936
01:15:35,155 --> 01:15:39,075
There's a lot of good womenfolks
in the world, don't get me wrong.

937
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:42,162
I mean, the majority of them,
they get high ideas...

938
01:15:43,246 --> 01:15:45,040
Iike they want to go out
on their own.

939
01:15:45,123 --> 01:15:47,500
They want to take over things.

940
01:15:47,584 --> 01:15:50,170
- That's right. Yeah.
- Is that what you mean?.

941
01:15:50,253 --> 01:15:52,339
But don't you never let them, son.

942
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:34,858
Come here.

943
01:17:36,693 --> 01:17:38,611
- Wow! Somebody made this.
- You see it?.

944
01:17:38,695 --> 01:17:40,822
Yeah, I made it. Look at this.

945
01:17:40,864 --> 01:17:43,199
Wow!

946
01:17:43,241 --> 01:17:45,702
That's a shower. You take
your clothes off over here...

947
01:17:45,785 --> 01:17:47,704
then you jump in there.

948
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:22,155
What'd your daddy do
in West Virginia?.

949
01:18:22,238 --> 01:18:25,075
Coal miner.

950
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:27,243
Why isn't he coal mining now?.

951
01:18:29,788 --> 01:18:32,374
Coal mine shut down, I reckon.

952
01:18:32,415 --> 01:18:34,501
We moved to Chicago.

953
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:37,879
He left,
and we ain't seen him since.

954
01:18:38,922 --> 01:18:42,384
Just took off. I don't know.

955
01:18:44,427 --> 01:18:46,388
We'll be good friends, okay?.

956
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:36,855
Bye.

957
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:41,026
Hey, champ. How you doing?.

958
01:19:45,488 --> 01:19:49,075
You see, the object of this one...

959
01:19:49,159 --> 01:19:52,037
is speed and power...

960
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,538
so...

961
01:19:55,665 --> 01:19:57,792
you work on both.

962
01:20:04,174 --> 01:20:05,759
You see...

963
01:20:07,927 --> 01:20:09,929
really, the object is...

964
01:20:10,013 --> 01:20:14,017
to knock the other guy's
brains out, and then you win.

965
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,854
Roll numberthree, numberthree.
Sound roll numberthree.

966
01:20:17,937 --> 01:20:21,691
National Democratic Convention,
August 1968.

967
01:20:23,443 --> 01:20:25,403
Hey, how goes my boy,
Johnny the Greek?.

968
01:20:25,487 --> 01:20:27,697
- All ri ght. Good.
- Good, good.

969
01:20:27,781 --> 01:20:30,784
You look like you're doing
all right these days.

970
01:20:30,867 --> 01:20:32,994
I saw you in the film
with Norman Mailer.

971
01:20:34,037 --> 01:20:37,999
- What kind of a guy is he?.
- He's out of sight.

972
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,752
I mean, Mailer is wild.
He's crazy.

973
01:20:40,835 --> 01:20:44,964
But the thing about Mailer is that
he cuts through the bullshit.

974
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:48,301
I mean, Mailer is a force.
He's a heavyweight.

975
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:50,971
Excuse me. May I make up
your room, please?.

976
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,848
Sure.

977
01:20:58,061 --> 01:21:00,146
Listen, you don't have
to start until Thursday.

978
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:03,525
- Can you get your own equipment?.
- Yeah, sure.

979
01:21:03,566 --> 01:21:06,069
- We shooting EF?.
- Yeah, but not pushed.

980
01:21:06,111 --> 01:21:07,904
Excuse me.
I'll just change the towels...

981
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:09,906
and then I won't
disturb you anymore.

982
01:21:19,582 --> 01:21:21,584
You seem kind of down,John.

983
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:25,130
Sometimes up, sometimes down.

984
01:21:26,423 --> 01:21:29,634
Nah, I'm okay.
I'm just anxious to get working.

985
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:33,096
The photography is not the problem
with this job, baby.

986
01:21:33,138 --> 01:21:35,682
This job is keeping up
without being crushed...

987
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:38,268
or having your clothes torn off.

988
01:21:38,351 --> 01:21:40,770
You'll see the day
after tomorrow.

989
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,316
You still see the nurse?.

990
01:21:44,399 --> 01:21:47,277
No, not for some time now.

991
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:50,113
- What was her name?.
- Ruth.

992
01:21:52,449 --> 01:21:54,034
And her number?.

993
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:57,662
Testing station two.
One, two, three, four.

994
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,416
Station two is good.

995
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,418
Let's go on to station three.

996
01:22:04,627 --> 01:22:07,505
One, two, three. One, two, three.
L et me see station three.

997
01:22:07,589 --> 01:22:11,176
Station three.
L et me see your light up there.

998
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:15,889
L et's see your light up there,
station three. That's good.

999
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,316
L et's try station two now.
Station two.

1000
01:22:38,411 --> 01:22:41,456
One, two, three. One, two, three.
L et me see station three.

1001
01:22:41,498 --> 01:22:43,667
Station three.
L et me see your light up there.

1002
01:22:43,750 --> 01:22:46,086
I used to come here
for the circus when I was a kid.

1003
01:22:46,169 --> 01:22:48,505
I can still smell it.

1004
01:22:48,588 --> 01:22:50,507
That's the stockyards.

1005
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,470
America is wonderful.

1006
01:22:55,553 --> 01:22:57,514
Wonderful, wonderful,
wonderful, wonderful, wonderful--

1007
01:23:00,475 --> 01:23:03,186
- It really makes it--
- Free

1008
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:08,692
Who's that?.

1009
01:23:10,151 --> 01:23:11,861
Oh, wow!

1010
01:23:11,945 --> 01:23:15,615
- Y eah, man.
- What's happening, man?.

1011
01:23:15,699 --> 01:23:20,078
Flashing. Flashing.
Flashing, man.

1012
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:24,040
- Flashing, man. Crazy, man.
- The sky is blue.

1013
01:23:24,124 --> 01:23:26,042
Out of sight, yeah.

1014
01:23:26,126 --> 01:23:28,753
Listen, are you hung up?.

1015
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:34,509
- A little strung out, mate?.
- I can't understand.

1016
01:23:34,592 --> 01:23:39,764
Out of sight, yeah.
Listen, are you hung up?.

1017
01:23:51,818 --> 01:23:53,570
Hi, boys and girls.
I'm Jimmy Carl Black.

1018
01:23:53,653 --> 01:23:55,572
I'm the Indian of the group.

1019
01:24:04,789 --> 01:24:07,334
What's there to live for

1020
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:12,047
Who needs the Peace Corps

1021
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:19,012
I'm completely stoned
I'm hippie, and I'm trippy

1022
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:21,598
And a gypsy on my own

1023
01:24:21,681 --> 01:24:25,644
I'll stay a week and get the grass
and take a bus back home

1024
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,729
I'm reallyjust a phony

1025
01:24:27,812 --> 01:24:30,440
But forgive me 'cause I'm stoned

1026
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:39,157
Every town must have a place
where phony hippies meet

1027
01:24:39,240 --> 01:24:40,867
Psychedelic dungeons

1028
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:43,536
Popping up on every street

1029
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:45,664
Go to

1030
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:50,126
San Francisco

1031
01:24:52,379 --> 01:24:54,506
How I love ya, how I love ya
How I love ya, how I love ya

1032
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:56,633
Frisco

1033
01:24:56,716 --> 01:24:58,969
How I love ya, how I love ya
How I love ya, how I love ya

1034
01:24:59,052 --> 01:25:01,179
Oh, my hair is getting
good in the back

1035
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:06,893
Every town must have a place
where phony hippies meet

1036
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:08,895
Psychedelic dungeons

1037
01:25:08,979 --> 01:25:11,398
Popping up on every street

1038
01:25:11,481 --> 01:25:13,608
Go to

1039
01:25:13,692 --> 01:25:18,697
San Francisco

1040
01:25:20,699 --> 01:25:22,993
First I'll buy some beads

1041
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:26,705
And then perhaps a leather band
to go around my head

1042
01:25:26,746 --> 01:25:28,581
Some feathers and bells

1043
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:31,209
And a book oflndian lore

1044
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:35,714
I will ask the chamber of commerce
how to get to Haight Street

1045
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,841
And smoke an awful lot ofdope

1046
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,927
I will wander around barefoot

1047
01:25:41,011 --> 01:25:44,431
I will have a psychedelic gleam
in my eye at all times

1048
01:25:44,514 --> 01:25:46,850
I will love everyone
I will love the police

1049
01:25:46,933 --> 01:25:50,020
As they kick the shit out ofme
on the street

1050
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,901
I can't. Harold's in there.
Please don't.

1051
01:26:16,796 --> 01:26:18,757
Don't. Please.

1052
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:48,782
Harold, you up here?.

1053
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,929
I asked his friends.
I told you...

1054
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:36,973
I asked everybody
in the whole neighborhood.

1055
01:30:37,057 --> 01:30:39,392
I've been up all night long
looking for him.

1056
01:30:39,476 --> 01:30:43,229
Please, please, can't you send
somebody to help me find him?.

1057
01:30:43,313 --> 01:30:45,649
- You people--
- Hello?.

1058
01:30:45,732 --> 01:30:47,776
Look, lady, we can't help.
The city's been invaded.

1059
01:30:47,859 --> 01:30:50,070
I can't spare a man.

1060
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:52,238
They usually come back, lady.

1061
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,972
Ladies and gentlemen!

1062
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:01,641
My name is Harold Horton!

1063
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:04,019
This is Harold Horton!

1064
01:32:06,688 --> 01:32:10,025
Hawaii votes 26 votesyes.

1065

1069
01:32:25,915 --> 01:32:28,835
Iowa passes. Kansas, 38.

1070

L eave the park at once.

1074

You are in violation ofthe law.

1076
01:34:52,228 --> 01:34:55,482
Hell, no, we won't go!

1077
01:35:22,008 --> 01:35:23,969
Peace! Now!

1078
01:35:33,687 --> 01:35:35,939
I'm looking for John Katselas.

1079
01:35:37,107 --> 01:35:40,193
Yes. Yes. Where is he?.

1080
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,863
Do you have the phone number?.

1081
01:35:45,156 --> 01:35:47,617
Where is the amphitheater?.

1082

Back up and sit down!

1100
01:37:37,686 --> 01:37:41,690
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

1101
01:37:56,204 --> 01:37:58,373
All right, you guys, move!

1102
01:38:01,418 --> 01:38:04,337
Remember Prague!
Remember Czechoslovakia!

1103
01:38:04,421 --> 01:38:06,339
Don't forget Budapest!

1104
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:11,386
Get those cameras out of here!

1105
01:38:11,428 --> 01:38:13,847
NBC, come back!

1106
01:38:13,930 --> 01:38:16,016
Stay with us!

1107
01:38:16,099 --> 01:38:18,351
NBC! Hey! Come back!

1108
01:38:18,435 --> 01:38:20,353
Stay with us!

1109
01:38:21,438 --> 01:38:23,481
All right, people.
Let's keep our cool.

1110
01:38:23,565 --> 01:38:26,234
There's nothing to fear
ofthese people. Keep our cool.

1111
01:38:34,284 --> 01:38:36,536
Yeah, tanks. It's incredible.

1112
01:38:36,619 --> 01:38:38,538
They're stopping them on 1 8th.

1113
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:41,791
Reinforce that lock.

1114
01:38:41,916 --> 01:38:43,710
Don't turn your backs to them.

1115
01:38:43,793 --> 01:38:45,712
Watch those two. Just move ahead.

1116
01:38:45,795 --> 01:38:47,464
Move right ahead.

1117
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,970
That's it. Turn left.
Turn right. Turn right.

1118
01:38:54,054 --> 01:38:55,639
Reinforce the single line.

1119
01:39:01,603 --> 01:39:03,813
You are subject to arrest.

1120
01:39:06,191 --> 01:39:08,109
Fuck you, pig!

1121
01:39:10,111 --> 01:39:12,072
You are in violation ofthe law.

1122
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:15,867
You are subject to arrest.

1123
01:39:15,909 --> 01:39:19,329
We have information
for the persons amongyou...

1124
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,791
who may attempt
to injure police officers.

1125
01:39:22,874 --> 01:39:24,834
We will take all
necessary precautions...

1126
01:39:24,918 --> 01:39:27,337
- to protect the policemen.
- Fuck you!

1127
01:39:27,420 --> 01:39:30,840
This is the final warning.
L eave now.

1128
01:39:41,017 --> 01:39:43,228
Look out, Haskell! It's real!

1129
01:39:43,395 --> 01:39:45,230
The mayor of Chicago.

1130
01:41:40,845 --> 01:41:45,392
Everybody gather
in the center ofthe park.

1131
01:41:51,815 --> 01:41:54,401
Don't struggle with them.
Just hold hands.

1132
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:57,487
Pigs!

1133
01:41:59,406 --> 01:42:01,366
Get the badge numbers!

1134
01:42:15,505 --> 01:42:17,716
Pigs are whores! Pigs are whores!

1135
01:42:40,113 --> 01:42:41,740
Get up and get off!

1136
01:42:52,167 --> 01:42:54,878
Let's get out of here,
you son of a bitch!

1137
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:04,387
Move!

1138
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:14,314
You stinkin' Commies!

1139
01:43:19,944 --> 01:43:21,112
Pigs!

1140
01:43:21,821 --> 01:43:23,448
Go home, pigs!

1141
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:26,117
Go home, you fuckin' cops!

1142
01:43:30,330 --> 01:43:32,248
Mr. Chairman, Colorado rises...

1143
01:43:32,332 --> 01:43:34,459
to a point ofinformation.

1144
01:43:34,542 --> 01:43:37,671
Is there any rule under which
Mayor Daley can be compelled...

1145
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:41,299
to suspend the police state terror
perpetrated this minute...

1146
01:43:41,383 --> 01:43:44,219
on kids in front of
the Conrad Hilton?

1147
01:43:46,179 --> 01:43:47,681
The--

1148
01:43:50,684 --> 01:43:52,477
Mr. Chairman.

1149
01:43:52,519 --> 01:43:55,480
The chair must announce...

1150
01:43:56,815 --> 01:44:00,610
that we are calling
the roll ofthe States...

1151
01:44:00,694 --> 01:44:03,613
and we recognize...

1152
01:44:03,697 --> 01:44:07,492
delegates for no otherpurpose
than to answer the call.

1153
01:44:07,534 --> 01:44:10,203
Pigs eat shit! Pigs eat shit!

1154
01:44:10,286 --> 01:44:12,455
Pi gs are whores! Pi gs are whores!

1155
01:44:13,540 --> 01:44:18,503
Ifyou don 't move up on the parkway,
I'll orderyour arrest.

1156
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:23,049
Move up on the parkway
or I must orderyour arrest.

1157
01:44:24,217 --> 01:44:26,970
There isn 't any distinction
anymore for us.

1158
01:44:31,599 --> 01:44:35,103
You go up on the side ofthe fire
structure, we're gonna get you.

1159
01:44:35,186 --> 01:44:39,149
You come off on our side,
then you get out. You dig?

1160
01:44:39,232 --> 01:44:41,735
I got a message now
from the drop-off community.

1161
01:44:41,818 --> 01:44:44,321
There are people in the streets
all over this country.

1162
01:44:44,404 --> 01:44:46,990
Up against the wall, motherfuckers!

1163
01:44:50,160 --> 01:44:55,623
Will the sergeant at arms
enforce order in the convention?

1164
01:44:55,707 --> 01:44:59,085
The question is on the motion.

1165
01:44:59,169 --> 01:45:01,338
So many as in favor, vote aye.

1166
01:45:01,421 --> 01:45:03,840
- Aye!
- Aye!

1167
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:05,842
Those opposed, no.
They ayes have it.

1168
01:45:05,925 --> 01:45:07,844
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

1169
01:45:11,431 --> 01:45:15,226
No more war! No more war!

1170
01:45:19,064 --> 01:45:21,983
Join us! Join us! Join us!

1171
01:47:10,675 --> 01:47:12,093
Mama!

1172
01:47:14,929 --> 01:47:16,056
Ma!

1173
01:47:16,097 --> 01:47:18,224
A friend ofmine
from El Paso was with me.

1174
01:47:18,266 --> 01:47:20,769
Somebody threw something.
He said, "Didyou see that?

1175
01:47:20,852 --> 01:47:22,771
It was a cap or something. "
I said, "No. "

1176
01:47:22,854 --> 01:47:27,233
Some cop says, "What'dyou throw?
What are you doing here?"

1177
01:47:27,275 --> 01:47:30,278
He said, "I'm from El Paso, Texas. "
Then he pushed him into the crowd.

1178
01:47:30,362 --> 01:47:31,946
They're trying to
keep them contained...

1179
01:47:32,030 --> 01:47:33,657
so they can beat them up later.

1180
01:47:33,740 --> 01:47:36,368
- That's right.
- Then this girl passed through--

1181
01:47:36,451 --> 01:47:39,913
The policemen are grabbing
and beating everybody in sight.

1182
01:47:39,954 --> 01:47:44,084
A line ofpolicemen has cut off
the very front ofthe Hilton.

1183
01:47:45,168 --> 01:47:47,379
- There's mayhem in the streets.
- The victim was identified...

1184
01:47:47,462 --> 01:47:50,799
as former Channel 8 News
cameraman,John Katselas.

1185
01:47:50,840 --> 01:47:52,968
Katselas was taken
to Michael Reese Hospital...

1186
01:47:53,051 --> 01:47:55,762
where he's reported
to be in critical condition.

1187
01:47:55,804 --> 01:47:58,640
Cause ofthe accident
is under investigation.

1188
01:47:58,682 --> 01:48:02,394
A woman companion, not yet
identified, was dead on arrival.

1189
01:48:02,477 --> 01:48:04,646
People were being clubbed--

1190
01:48:04,729 --> 01:48:07,148
and I mean in Technicolor 3-D--

1191
01:48:07,232 --> 01:48:09,776
and they were crying and screaming.

1192
01:48:10,986 --> 01:48:13,613
I don 't know that
I've seen any bloodyet...

1193
01:48:13,697 --> 01:48:16,157
but I've seen
some liquid on the ground.

1194
01:48:17,200 --> 01:48:19,786
People were standing around crying.

1195
01:48:21,663 --> 01:48:25,542
What's your reaction to this girl
with the McCarthy pin?

1196
01:48:25,625 --> 01:48:27,544
I have no comment.

1197
01:48:27,627 --> 01:48:31,006
Girls, girls, boys, people of every
description are being grabbed...

1198
01:48:31,047 --> 01:48:33,008
and dragged into paddy wagons.

1199
01:48:33,049 --> 01:48:35,010
What didyou say?

1200
01:48:41,308 --> 01:48:43,226
And they're chasing people,
particularly people...

1201
01:48:43,310 --> 01:48:45,854
with anarchist flags
or anything like that.

1202
01:48:45,937 --> 01:48:48,565
You can see crowds
running in all directions...

1203
01:48:48,648 --> 01:48:51,526
and plenty ofthings
are being thrown.

1204
01:48:51,568 --> 01:48:53,737
Police have just grabbed somebody...

1205
01:48:53,820 --> 01:48:55,739
and are beating him over the head.

1206
01:48:55,822 --> 01:48:58,992
The whole crowd across the street
isyelling, "Sieg heil."

1207
01:49:00,368 --> 01:49:02,996
Another melee
is taking place in the park...

1208
01:49:03,079 --> 01:49:05,040
right in front ofthe nation.

1209
01:49:05,081 --> 01:49:07,959
Right in front ofthe entire nation,
this is happening.

1210
01:49:08,043 --> 01:49:11,463
NBC- TV is on the roof of
the Haymarket Cocktails/Restaurant--

1211
01:49:11,546 --> 01:49:14,591
part ofthe Statler Hilton--

1212
01:49:14,674 --> 01:49:17,969
seeing these people being dragged
into the police wagon.

1213
01:49:18,053 --> 01:49:21,890
The whole world is watching!
The whole world is watching!

1214
01:49:32,067 --> 01:49:35,195
I'm a successful businessman. I've
been saying, like everybody else...

1215
01:49:35,278 --> 01:49:37,405
"These kids are a bunch ofbums. "

1216
01:49:37,489 --> 01:49:39,574
Then I finally found out
when I got down here...

1217
01:49:39,658 --> 01:49:42,410
that, goddamn it,
the kids are right.

1218
01:49:42,452 --> 01:49:44,746
- What made you find out?
- I got gassed.

1219
01:49:44,788 --> 01:49:46,748
I came down here, and I got gassed.

1220
01:49:46,790 --> 01:49:49,793
Andyou kids, go, man, go!

1221
01:49:49,876 --> 01:49:52,045
The police just grabbed somebody...

1222
01:49:52,128 --> 01:49:54,089
and are beating him over the head...

1223
01:49:54,130 --> 01:49:56,091
and are trying to throw him...

1224
01:49:56,132 --> 01:49:58,218
into the paddy wagon.

1225
01:49:58,259 --> 01:50:01,388
A scoop, made ofpolice, simply...

1226
01:50:01,429 --> 01:50:05,058
flies out and-- flies out--

1227
01:50:05,141 --> 01:50:06,476
Move! Move!

1228
01:50:06,559 --> 01:50:08,478
I'm being made to move.

1229
01:50:08,561 --> 01:50:11,147
The cameraman, everybody's
being made to move now.

1230
01:50:11,231 --> 01:50:13,733
