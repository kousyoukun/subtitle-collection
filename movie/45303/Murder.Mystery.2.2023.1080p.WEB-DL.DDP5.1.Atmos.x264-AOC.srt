Mademoiselle Claudette Joubert.

It is such a pleasure to meet you.

And Nick.

- All right!

Yeah. I love it.

[Claudette] Please, come.

So happy you could squeeze us in.

We had extra seats 'cause my parents died.

- Oh! I'm so sorry.

Oh, okay. So, they're coming?

190
00:08:07,208 --> 00:08:10,416
Uh, no, they died,
but they were never gonna come.

191
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,250
'Cause I hated them.

192

- Okay.

193
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:17,791
Oh. Colonel, you know the Spitzes.

194

- What?
- Colonel!

195
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,625
My friends!

196
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,875
- My God!
- Oh my God. What happened to your arm?

197
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,166
Is it that noticeable?

198
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:29,000
Last time we saw you,
you had a lot more of... of your arm.

199
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,583
Well, if I had to lose one,
that would be the one to lose

200
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,750
because it's already missing a hand.

201
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:37,541
You don't have to share the armrest now
at the movie theater.

202
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:40,458
- [all chuckle]
- Yo, yo, yo. But real talk.

203
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,625
The Colonel stopped a bullet
meant for me in Mumbai.

204
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:45,583
- You kidding?
- Somebody tried to shoot you?

205
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,583
Yeah. Some people don't like
the way my company does business.

206
00:08:48,583 --> 00:08:52,541
Sadly, the Colonel's injury stops him
from protecting me to the fullest,

207
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,541
so I had to get me a new head bodyguard.

208
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,875
Mr. Louis!

209
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:58,125
- Check it out, right?
- [Audrey] Hello, Louis!

210
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,083
And, yo, my man is fully armed.

211

[Nick] He's <i>fully</i> armed. That's funny!

212
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,625
Okay. I hope
you don't find anything in there.

I hate to say it.

215
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:11,083
If you and the Colonel are ever caught
in a fight, my money's on the Colonel.

216
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:14,416
He'd open a can of whoop ass
with his, uh... with his good arm.

217
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,625
No? You didn't like that one?
I was joking around.

218
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,958
- Nice to meet you.

It's like a rehearsal dinner.

quite entertaining.

you need. Make yourselves at home.

- [Nick] That's nice.

- Without her, I would not be happy.

242
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,083
- With her, I'm the happiest.
- Not a day goes by where I just wanna go...

[grunts] I love you so much.

She makes every decision for us,
and I'm fine with that.

- Thank you!

306
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,875
Oh, how handsome are you, man?

307
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,750
I only have eye for you, Nick.

308
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,500
Oh! You better keep it that way!
All right!

309
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,458
In a most beautiful place
on a most beautiful night,

310
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:16,625
you have to be
the most beautiful thing of all.

311
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:17,541
Um...

312
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:21,750
Whoa. Okay. Definitely kissing
every single finger I have.

313
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,125
I have made love
to more than 10,000 women.

314
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,500
- [Audrey murmurs]
- None as ravishing as you.

315
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:28,458
Okay. Well, speaking
of staggering numbers,

316
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:31,041
this is my husband of 16 years.

317
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,500
I've made love to one woman.

318
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,375
- And I did it terribly, by the way.
- [Audrey] All right.

319
00:13:35,375 --> 00:13:39,125
Holy sh-- This is... You're that guy,
Francisco Perez, yeah?

320
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,875
This guy used to be a soccer player.

321
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,791
He headbutted some dude one time
and put him into a coma.

322
00:13:43,791 --> 00:13:47,500
Yeah. I know. I hit him so hard,
he lost his ability to blink.

323
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,583
Anyway, it was so nice to meet you.
So, we're go--

324
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,958
What about you?
How do you know the Maharajah?

325
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,625
Well, after I retired from football,

326
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,208
his father made me
the chairman of the board of directors

327
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,625
of Shiz-Vik, his company.

328
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:03,291
Also, I helped him land that beautiful
bride of his, the blonde. [chuckles]

329
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,208
Although she has nothing
on this one. My God.

330
00:14:06,208 --> 00:14:07,416
- Okay.
- Okay.

331
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,000
I'll see you in a second.

332
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,916
$10,000, you can have one night with her.

333
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,791
I'm kidding, you sick bastard.

334
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,291
[pop music playing in background]

335
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:21,083
[woman] That's quite the plate.

336
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,583
Do they not have food where you come from?

337
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,583
Oh, um...

338
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:30,750
No, you know, I just... I'm so used
to my husband just eating off my plate,

339
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,250
so it's sort of become a habit.

340
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,708
But, no, you're absolutely right.
I don't need this.

341
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:37,333
No, no, no! Don't put it back.

342
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,958
- I was not gonna do that.
- [woman scoffs]

343
00:14:40,541 --> 00:14:41,583
Americans.

344
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,166
[scoffs] Americans. [chuckles]

345
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,541
Would you care for one?

346
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,458
Oh, I'm so good.
Thank you. Maybe another time.

347
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,541
[woman speaks Hindi]

348
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,375
- [Audrey] So, um...
- Thank you.

349
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,000
Are you on the bride's side?

350
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,291
No, I'm Saira, groom's sister.

351
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:14,041
I did not know Vik had a sister.

352
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:15,333
Yeah. [chuckles]

353
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,375
[Audrey groans]

354
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,583
- These are very low tables!
- [chuckles]

355
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,500
Are you reading 'cause you don't like
weddings like this, or...

356
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,833
No, you know,
it's more that I don't like people.

357
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,916
I mean, these people in particular.

358
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:32,000
I guess as long as Claudette
and your brother have fun,

359
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,250
that's all that matters.

360
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,541
Right. I don't really understand
how anyone gets married.

361
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,791
Spending so much time
with one person. Can you imagine?

362
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,833
- [man coughing and wheezing]
- [Audrey] Hmm...

363
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,125
[coughing]

364
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:48,875
Well, speaking of my one person,

365
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:50,583
there he is.

366
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,125
Nick, this is Saira.

367
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,458
This is Vik's sister.

368
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,125
- Would you...
- [Saira] No.

369
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,458
- You good?
- [Audrey] She's good.

370
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:59,333
- I am Nick. Nice to meet you.
- Saira.

371
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,666
Love your brother, by the way.

372
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,375
- He's hysterical.
- [Saira] Right.

373
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,500
Oh boy.

374
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:08,416
Okay, if you're trying to seduce me,
it's really not working.

375
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:09,458
Oh my God.

376
00:16:09,458 --> 00:16:13,333
Hey, Nick. I was just thinking
about your lovely wife.

377
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,583
Oh, you again.

378
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,291
I see you've already met Francisco.

379
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:19,458
And I guess you're both acquainted
with Vikram's harpy of a sister.

380
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,708
- Did he say "herpe"?
- Harpy.

381
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:25,541
Countess! How humiliating it must be
for you to see Claudette

382
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,958
actually close a deal with the Maharajah.

383
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:30,666
Ever wonder what
you might have done wrong, dear?

384
00:16:30,666 --> 00:16:34,750
Ever wonder what it feels like
to be tall enough to ride a rollercoaster?

385
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:38,083
[woman snickering]

386
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,875
That's Countess Sekou.

387
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,625
She's Vik's ex-fiancée,

388
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,208
and she's
Claudette's old university roommate.

389
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:47,458
And they're still friends?
She's quite rude, by the way.

390
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:50,708
Well, on top of all that,
she's also Claudette's maid of honor.

391
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:51,625
- [Audrey] What?
- Yeah.

392
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:55,583
[man over PA] Hope you watched the video
because the dancing is about to begin!

393
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:58,041
- What dancing?
- I'm gonna fake going to the bathroom.

394
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,375
- I don't dance. You dance.
- I didn't get a video. Did you?

395
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,833
They brought one to the room.

396
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,291
- I forgot to tell you.
- Thanks.

00:21:03,208 --> 00:21:05,708
[Colonel] We will find him.
We will find him.

463
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,583
[panting]

464
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,416
The Maharajah's been kidnapped.

465
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,833
- What?
- [Countess] Oh my God!

466
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:12,791
- Where did they take him?
- [Nick] He's alive.

467
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:16,125
Somebody with a machine gun
threw him on a boat, and they took off.

468
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:17,541
- How many kidnappers?
- [Nick] One.

469
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,000
Which means his partner
is still here on the island.

470
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,458
Hold on. How do you know there were two?

471
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:25,583
If the kidnapper had Vik
and was taking him to the boat...

472
00:21:25,583 --> 00:21:28,458
Ah, someone else
was leading the elephant into the tent.

473
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,166
- Thank you.
- There are 400 people on this island.

474
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,416
That's a lot of suspects.

475
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,666
Let us narrow it down for you,
okay, Colonel?

476
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,250
Claudette, how many people knew about
the elephant being part of the ceremony?

477
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,166
Just the board.

478
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,375
Yeah, we had to sign off at the expense
of transporting an elephant.

479
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,375
So that means all of you.

480
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:45,958
What are you implying?

481
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,916
I think it's very obvious
what I'm implying.

482
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:51,541
- [Nick] Mm-hmm.
- One of you is an accomplice to a murder.

483
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:54,500
[mysterious music playing]

484
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,208
- That is ridiculous!
- I'm not on the board!

485
00:21:56,208 --> 00:21:59,000
Is it? You all hated my brother!

486
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,208
What? No, I... I love Vik.

487
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:03,041
[scoffs] Oh, please!

488
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:05,541
- You've never forgiven me.
- For what?

489
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:08,250
- Breaking up your engagement.
- Oh, get over yourself.

490
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,708
It was an arranged marriage
between our families.

491
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:16,041
We amicably split in order to allow
for your so-called "love marriage."

492
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,791
You didn't want this marriage
to go through so you kidnapped him!

493
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,083
You gold-digging--

494
00:22:20,083 --> 00:22:24,333
- Ladies, stop it!
- Calm down, everybody!

495
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:27,041
- We do this for a living. It's what we do.
- [Nick] It's our thing.

496
00:22:27,041 --> 00:22:28,875
- And this is not just another case.
- No.

497
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,000
- [Nick] This is personal.
- [Audrey] Yeah, it's Vik.

498
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,208
- [Nick] He means a lot to us.
- [Audrey] So we'll find out who did this.

499
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:37,458
- [Nick] A hundred percent.
- [Audrey] And find out why they did this.

500
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,041
And we're gonna get Vik back, okay?

501
00:22:39,041 --> 00:22:42,625
We're gonna do this
for the low, low price of $25 million.

502
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,791
[silence]

503
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,458
Twenty-five mil, honey. I swear to God.

504
00:22:48,458 --> 00:22:50,166
[Nick] I would've settled for ten grand.

505
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:51,666
So insane.

506
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,291
[Nick grunts]

507
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:56,125
What are you doing?

508
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,458
[Nick] I'm blocking the door
so no one can get in.

509
00:22:58,458 --> 00:23:00,250
[Audrey]
Honey, you're gonna hurt your back.

510
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:03,166
You know what would hurt my back?
A knife going through it.

511
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:04,666
The killer knows we're on to him.

512
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,750
We're on the next-to-kill list.
I guarantee it.

513
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,708
What happened to Vik?

514
00:23:07,708 --> 00:23:10,166
A guy that rich
gets kidnapped for the money.

515
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:11,791
There's no profit in hurting him.

516
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:15,083
Oh God. We're not gonna be invited
anywhere ever again. Ever again.

517
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,500
The cheese has a hold on me, honey.
I can't stop.

518
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,708
Are you just... Will you take a slice
like a civilized person?

519
00:23:20,708 --> 00:23:22,166
I don't know where the knife is.

520
00:23:22,166 --> 00:23:24,666
- Oh Jesus!
- [Nick] What? You got a headache?

521
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:26,000
- Yes!
- [Nick] I'm sorry.

522
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,875
- How's your back?
- My back's killing me.

523
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,333
- I'll get Advil.
- Please. Please.

524
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:32,708
- I'm gonna get more cheese in me.
- Honey, do not eat all that cheese.

525
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,791
That affects... You're terrible all night.

526
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,208
- Absolutely.
- Oh.

527
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,833
And I have pictures from the tent
of a burned robe with bloodstains.

528
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,666
Someone was trying
to get rid of the evidence,

529
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:43,875
and I'm sure it was the elephant handler.

530
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:45,208
Good detecting, sweetheart.

531
00:23:45,208 --> 00:23:47,208
- I'm doing my best. Here.
- [Nick] Okay. Thank you.

532
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,250
- [Audrey] One, two, three, four.
- [Nick] Okay.

533
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,500
- [frantic knocking on door]
- [dramatic music playing]

534
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,041
[Nick] I gotta move this stuff now?

535
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,333
What if that's the killer?

536
00:23:55,333 --> 00:23:57,666
- Killers don't knock.
- What if it's housekeeping?

537
00:23:57,666 --> 00:24:00,375
We... We're good! We don't need any towels.

538
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:03,208
No! No! We do need towels.
Leave 'em out front, please!

539
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:05,333
We've been here ten minutes.
You need more towels?

540
00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:07,166
You use 30 towels after every shower.

541
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,666
I'm sorry. At least I shower.

542
00:24:08,666 --> 00:24:10,041
All right, you got me there.

543
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:11,958
[Francisco] It's me, Francisco!

544
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:12,958
Francisco?

545
00:24:12,958 --> 00:24:15,083
Wait, wait, wait. What if he's the killer?

546
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,583
The only thing
he wants to murder is your hm-hm!

547
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:18,500
Hey!

548
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,875
- [Francisco] Hurry! There's no time!
- [Nick] Be right there!

549
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,666
- [Audrey] We're hurrying!
- [Nick] We know!

550
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,208
So sorry.

551
00:24:26,208 --> 00:24:27,458
- [Nick] Hey.
- Hey.

552
00:24:29,291 --> 00:24:30,750
- You.
- [Nick] Mm-hmm.

553
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:32,375
Gorgeous.

554
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,416
[Nick] Jesus Christ. All right.

555
00:24:36,166 --> 00:24:37,708
[Audrey] Put this back. You said hurry.

556
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,750
What's... How can we help?

557
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,500
- I have information.
- [Nick] Yes.

558
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,791
Everyone thinks Claudette
is this gold digger,

559
00:24:43,791 --> 00:24:47,500
but what's not so well known
is the fact that, as a precaution,

560
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,625
the board made her sign a brutal prenup.

561
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:55,250
So that means if Vik divorces her,
she's left with nothin'.

562
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,291
[dramatic music swells]

563
00:24:58,291 --> 00:25:01,375
- I gotta move this shit again?
- Wait. Wait. Who is it?

564
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:03,875
[Claudette] It's Claudette.
You must hear what I have to say.

565
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,458
Okay, one second.

566
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:06,875
Let's get you in the closet.

567
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:09,250
[Nick] Okay, be right there.
I gotta get some cheese.

568
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:11,458
- Okay. Just go in there.
- [rock scraping floor]

569
00:25:11,458 --> 00:25:13,708
No! Get off of... Jesus!

570
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:15,541
- Coming, Claudette!
- Sorry! One second.

571
00:25:15,541 --> 00:25:17,208
[breathing heavily]

572
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,125
[Nick] Hurry!

573
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,708
- [Audrey] Hello, Claudette.
- [Nick] Hi.

574
00:25:20,708 --> 00:25:22,083
[Claudette sighs]

575
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,958
[Claudette]
They all think I'm marrying Vik

576
00:25:24,958 --> 00:25:26,916
just for the money,
especially the Countess.

577
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,791
She's been jealous of me
ever since we met.

578
00:25:29,791 --> 00:25:31,916
- Really? I can imagine why.
- I can imagine.

579
00:25:31,916 --> 00:25:34,333
But still, she was my best friend.

580
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:35,416
- Right.
- [Nick] Sure.

581
00:25:35,416 --> 00:25:36,708
- You know?
- Yeah.

582
00:25:36,708 --> 00:25:38,666
- We were so close.
- [Audrey] Oh!

583
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,833
And I think I just miss her sometimes.

584
00:25:41,416 --> 00:25:44,541
- Oh, sorry.
- [Claudette sobbing]

585
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:47,458
- I just wanna know who kidnapped my Vik.
- Mm-hmm.

586
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,708
They all have something to gain from this.

587
00:25:49,708 --> 00:25:52,875
Pfft!

588
00:25:52,875 --> 00:25:55,208
- Terrible.
- [Claudette] I can't trust any of them!

589
00:25:55,208 --> 00:25:56,791
- [whispers] There's a gun.
- A gun?

590
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:59,041
[Claudette] The Colonel,
so bitter about his demotion.

591
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:01,375
Saira, always starved for attention.

592
00:26:02,041 --> 00:26:04,500
And Vik had just discovered

593
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,166
Francisco's dark secret.

594
00:26:06,166 --> 00:26:08,000
- [Audrey] What?
- [Nick] He had a secret?

595
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,458
- Oh!
- [Nick] Oh God.

596
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:10,750
- [cocks gun]
- [Audrey gasps]

597
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,208
- [Audrey] We don't need to do that.
- [Nick] That's cool.

598
00:26:13,208 --> 00:26:14,208
Who is it?

599
00:26:14,208 --> 00:26:15,583
It's Saira. Let me in.

600
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,666
Uh, okay. One second.

601
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:18,500
- I need to hide. The closet!
<i>-</i> No, no, no!

602
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,375
- [Nick] It's too dark.
- Here. Come on.

603
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:22,500
- [Nick] She has all her stuff.
- One second, Saira!

604
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,833
[Nick] Coming! Be right there!

605
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:26,041
[Nick straining]

606
00:26:26,041 --> 00:26:27,875
Okay, gotta get to you!

607
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,666
- So sorry. One second.
- Moving around some stuff for fun!

608
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:34,125
- I know who you need to be looking at.
- [Nick] Who?

609
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,708
- Claudette!
- [Nick] Claudette?

610
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:38,333
[Saira] I told Vik she was bad news
the minute I met her.

611
00:26:38,333 --> 00:26:40,250
She's suspicious,
narcissistic, manipulative,

612
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,458
and looks cheap as well
in that red dress--

613
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:45,916
Excuse me! I'm so sorry to interrupt,
but I feel like I'd be a rude hostess

614
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:49,250
if I didn't offer you a piece of this
exquisite artisan cheese that's...

615
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,875
Nick, where's this...
Where's that cheese? The big--

616
00:26:51,875 --> 00:26:53,333
- The cheese is gone.
- Where is it?

617
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:54,541
I put it, uh, in my stomach.

618
00:26:54,541 --> 00:26:56,291
You ate that entire block of cheese?

619
00:26:56,291 --> 00:26:59,791
Trying to shame me. I don't know
if that's gonna get the cheese back--

620
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:01,916
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be selfish--

621
00:27:01,916 --> 00:27:03,375
Sorry. Hold on. You know what?

622
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:07,291
Let me give you a drink right now
just to relax you a little bit.

623
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:08,541
- Here.
- I... I don't want that.

624
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:10,500
- No? Okay.
- I'm okay.

625
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,666
[frantic knocking]

626
00:27:11,666 --> 00:27:13,875
- Oh shit.
- [Saira] Who is it?

627
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,666
- [Audrey] Not sure.
- You expecting someone?

628
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:18,000
It's like an after-party.
People just show up.

629
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,083
Let's put you into the bedroom,
just in case, 'cause I don't know.

630
00:27:21,083 --> 00:27:23,333
- I'll hide there.
- Don't hide in there! Why?

631
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,333
That's an obvious spot.

632
00:27:24,333 --> 00:27:26,625
- [Audrey] Is it hot in here?
- I'm hot too.

633
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,166
- I'm coming!
- [knocking continues]

634
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,500
What if <i>that</i> is the killer?

635
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,583
Don't you kinda want it
to be the killer so they can kill us?

636
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:33,916
I am sick of this shit.

637
00:27:33,916 --> 00:27:35,916
- Baby, I do not feel very good.
- [rock scraping]

638
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,250
[lock clicking]

639
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,583
What's doin'? Yeah?

640
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,083
Hey, great to see you.

641
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:44,000
What's going on? [chuckles lightly]

642
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:47,166
[door closes]

643
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:48,500
[Countess] I know who did it.

644
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,666
Who?

645
00:27:51,916 --> 00:27:53,250
It was Francisco.

646
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,666
Francisco!

647
00:27:54,666 --> 00:27:58,000
He has had over 85 paternity suits
filed against him.

648
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,250
We suspect he's been siphoning money
out of the company

649
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,875
in order to pay
for all of these babies he made.

650
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:04,708
That's a lie!

651
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,125
Not the part about the babies.

652
00:28:06,125 --> 00:28:09,083
Yes, that's true.
I've spread my seed far and wide,

653
00:28:09,083 --> 00:28:11,916
but I have never stolen in my life.

654
00:28:11,916 --> 00:28:14,416
- What are you doing here?
- An excellent question.

655
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:17,083
- What are you all doing here?
- Saira's here.

656
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,333
- Nobody move!
- Oh my God!

657
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:21,375
I ain't moving.

658
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,916
[cell phone ringing]

659
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:24,791
It's mine. It's mine.

660
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:27,750
- I missed it.
- [Nick] Missed the call?

661
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:29,208
[phone beeping]

662
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:30,916
I have a message.

663
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:35,916
[distorted voice] <i>We have the Maharajah.</i>

664
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,250
<i>If you contact the authorities, he dies.</i>

665
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,541
<i>We'll make our demands
known to you at 7:00 a.m.</i>

666
00:28:41,541 --> 00:28:42,583
[call disconnects]

667
00:28:42,583 --> 00:28:45,458
That voice is hysterical.
You got to admit it.

668
00:28:45,458 --> 00:28:47,625
So we should all stay here.
Correct, Colonel?

669
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:51,166
Because one of us is definitely
working with the kidnapper.

670
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:55,041
Yeah. Motives, opportunities.

671
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,375
Somebody here.

672
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:58,541
My head is spinning a little bit.

673
00:28:58,541 --> 00:28:59,958
Honey?

674
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,583
Babe, are you taking a nap?
I'm tired, too, so let's, uh...

675
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:07,791
Nobody leave here
until we figure out who did what.

676
00:29:07,791 --> 00:29:09,291
It's great to see everybody.

677
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,750
- Thanks for coming over. Sorry, my bad.
- [Francisco] Whoa!

678
00:29:15,375 --> 00:29:17,291
[inhales deeply]

679
00:29:17,291 --> 00:29:20,208
[sighing] Hmm!

680
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,833
[Audrey groaning]

681
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,541
[yelps] Jesus! What?

682
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,541
Oh my God. Nick?

683
00:29:32,541 --> 00:29:34,000
- [Nick] Yeah.
- Nick?

684
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
[Nick] Yeah?

685
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,791
- [Audrey] Nick!
- Uh-huh.

686
00:29:36,791 --> 00:29:39,541
Nicky, honey.
Get up. Get up! We got roofied.

687
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:42,458
- What happened?
- [Audrey] Baby. Oh my God! We fell asleep!

688
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,750
- [Nick] Oh yeah?
- Honey!

689
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,833
[Nick] We're sleeping now.

690
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:47,375
I don't know what happened. Uh, I...

691
00:29:47,375 --> 00:29:49,625
- Come on! Get up, Nick!
- [Nick] Okay. Up. I'm up.

692
00:29:49,625 --> 00:29:50,708
[Audrey] Who did this?

693
00:29:50,708 --> 00:29:52,958
[Nick] What? Now they're just showing off.

694
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:56,375
- [Audrey] Hurry up!
- [Nick] Okay, I'm coming, honey. So...

695
00:29:56,375 --> 00:29:58,125
- [Audrey] Get up!
- [Nick] I'm up!

696
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:02,000
- Calm down before you say anything.
- Nobody drugs us and gets away with it!

697
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,666
- Maybe they didn't drug us.
- It's illegal!

698
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:04,958
Maybe we just ate too much.

699
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:08,083
- That's why we passed out.
- Nick. Audrey. Just in time.

700
00:30:08,666 --> 00:30:09,916
- For what?
- For what?

701
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:12,000
The real detectives have just arrived.

702
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,166
[intense music playing]

703
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,291
[Colonel] Connor Miller.

704
00:30:19,291 --> 00:30:22,625
- [Audrey gasps]
- Former MI6 hostage negotiator.

705
00:30:22,625 --> 00:30:25,750
Oh my God.
Specializes in high-profile cases.

706
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:28,250
He got the President of Uruguay's son
back from the cartel.

707
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,208
- He wrote the book. He wrote the book.
- On what?

708
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,416
How Rogaine doesn't work for everybody?

709
00:30:32,416 --> 00:30:34,416
The book! Our course detective book!

710
00:30:36,416 --> 00:30:38,916
[Miller] Greetings.
I hear you need a case solved.

711
00:30:40,208 --> 00:30:42,333
Colonel. Been a long time.

712
00:30:42,916 --> 00:30:44,333
Francisco Perez.

713
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:45,583
Huh?

714
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:46,750
Big fan.

715
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:47,916
- Oh.
- Hey.

716
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:51,291
Mr. Miller, we're also very big fans.
Um, we can bring you up to speed.

717
00:30:51,291 --> 00:30:54,666
So what we know already is that
this is at least a two-person job.

718
00:30:54,666 --> 00:30:58,375
I saw the first guy
escape with Vik on a boat,

719
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,375
leaving the second guy
still on the island.

720
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:03,166
Also, just so you know,
we were both drugged last night.

721
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,666
I don't know if we were drugged.
We did have a few drinks--

722
00:31:05,666 --> 00:31:07,250
- You must be the Spitzes.
- Yes.

723
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:08,833
Yes, we are!

724
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:10,666
Your reputations precede you.

725
00:31:10,666 --> 00:31:11,958
- There you go.
- Why, thank you.

726
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:14,875
- That's nice to hear.
- Uh, not in a positive way, I'm afraid.

727
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,000
Okay.

728
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,125
I understand the last time
you were involved in something like this,

729
00:31:19,125 --> 00:31:20,333
everybody died?

730
00:31:20,333 --> 00:31:22,625
Well, that was not the Maharajah.

731
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:24,125
How's he doing now?

732
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,375
- [laughs] Okay.
- Right.

733
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:28,041
The Colonel's still here,
most of him, so there. That's good.

734
00:31:28,041 --> 00:31:30,708
Um, listen.
Mr. Miller, I read your book, and--

735
00:31:30,708 --> 00:31:33,000
[Miller] Colonel, I wanna see
all the security footage.

736
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,208
All the footage
was wiped from the mainframe.

737
00:31:35,208 --> 00:31:36,791
Yeah, 'cause it's an inside job.

738
00:31:36,791 --> 00:31:37,833
Mademoiselle Joubert,

739
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,333
we'll need your phone
for a vocal analysis of the voice mail.

740
00:31:40,333 --> 00:31:41,541
Of course. Anything you need.

741
00:31:41,541 --> 00:31:45,125
They're professional, no doubt.
They were concise and brief on the phone.

742
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,375
We also have reason to believe

743
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:49,250
that the inside man
was posing as an elephant handler.

744
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:52,708
You really wanna do
suspects now, Mrs. Spitz?

745
00:31:52,708 --> 00:31:54,000
- Sure.
- [Miller] Fine.

746
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,916
How about this? Uh...

747
00:31:55,916 --> 00:31:58,708
A husband and wife,
one an NYPD almost-detective,

748
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,375
the other a hairdresser
taking online classes.

749
00:32:01,375 --> 00:32:03,875
Together they run
a private detective agency

750
00:32:03,875 --> 00:32:05,625
teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.

751
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:07,083
And if I were to hazard a guess,

752
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,375
I'd say it's probably
taking a toll on their marriage.

753
00:32:09,958 --> 00:32:12,250
Desperate to give validity
to their failing business,

754
00:32:12,250 --> 00:32:16,125
they accept a last-minute invite
from a billionaire to attend his wedding.

755
00:32:16,125 --> 00:32:17,625
And so a plan is born.

756
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:21,125
Twenty-four hours after their arrival,
there's a high-profile kidnapping,

757
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,708
the sort that gets attention.

758
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,208
A career maker.

759
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,583
How's my reasoning, fellow... detectives?

760
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,833
- Pretty excellent. None of it was true.
- Gorgeous.

761
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:33,416
I was starting to go with it
'cause of the way you phrase things.

762
00:32:33,416 --> 00:32:35,166
- I almost believed him.
- The accent helps.

763
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:38,458
Call trace is ready. Kidnappers should be
calling in any minute.

764
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:40,208
If you'll excuse me, I have a job to do.

765
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,833
- Okay, so listen.
- [Audrey] Yes, honey.

766
00:32:41,833 --> 00:32:45,166
We got good cheese. We got free iPhones.

These are sex handcuffs.

1071
00:45:13,708 --> 00:45:15,708
Look. All I gotta do is this.

1072
00:45:17,083 --> 00:45:17,916
[Nick chuckles]

1073
00:45:18,666 --> 00:45:21,000
Okay. When they see me with this,
they'll follow me.

1074
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:22,625
- [Nick] Right.
- Nothing I can't handle.

1075
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:23,583
I see that.

1076
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:25,791
Meet at the Madeleine, 1900 hours.

1077
00:45:25,791 --> 00:45:27,583
No problem. Yeah, we'll be there.

1078
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,958
I was harsh about your business before.

1079
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:32,708
We may not be equals,
but we do share a passion.

1080
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:34,375
I see that now.

1081
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:35,500
Hurrah!

1082
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,625
Hey, I was wrong. That guy is a stud.

1083
00:45:37,625 --> 00:45:38,541
Honey...

1084
00:45:39,291 --> 00:45:40,958
What if Miller's the kidnapper?

1085
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:43,500
[Nick] He said he's gonna meet us
at 1900 hours at the Madeleine.

1086
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,666
I know, but bad people, they lie.

1087
00:45:45,666 --> 00:45:49,708
All right?
And we just handed the guy $70 million.

1088
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,000
- Oh God. Maybe you're right.
- I'm just saying.

1089
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:52,916
[engine turns over]

1090
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:57,708
Nope, you were wrong.

1091
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:03,666
- Who's this?
- I don't know. Where'd he come from?

1092
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:07,666
- [Nick] He's gonna walk into the flames?
- He walked right into that.

1093
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,416
He's got the case!

1094
00:46:10,958 --> 00:46:11,791
[man grunts]

1095
00:46:11,791 --> 00:46:13,791
- No! Oh my God!
- Now I'm very confused!

1096
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:16,041
- [Audrey] Oh no. Who's that guy?
- [Nick] This guy?

1097
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:16,958
Oh my God!

1098
00:46:18,291 --> 00:46:21,000
[Audrey whispering] N-E-4-1-3-D-A-N.

1099
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:23,541
We're Europe's most wanted again.
We better run!

1100
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:25,541
- I'm gonna grab... Okay.
- Grab that hat.

1101
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,125
- What is... Um...
- [Nick] What is this?

1102
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:31,416
{\an8}- [Delacroix speaking French]
- [Nick] It's Delacroix! That guy loves us.

1103
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:33,458
{\an8}[continues in French]

1104
00:46:33,458 --> 00:46:36,166
- I understood "opera." Okay. Go, go, go!
- Okay. Okay.

1105
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,750
[people clamoring on TV]

1106

[both singing "Flower Duet" by Delibes]

1107
00:47:13,791 --> 00:47:15,250
- [gasps] How?
- [Audrey] Surprise!

1108
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:16,291
Audrey and Nick!

1109
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:19,583
- Smoke rings! How you doing?
- Hi! Did you get our Christmas card?

1110
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,750
I'm fine, and yes.
The matching sweaters were a nice touch.

1111
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,375
- [laughs softly]
- That was my idea.

1112
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:26,916
So, hey, we need a little bit of help.

1113
00:47:26,916 --> 00:47:28,708
- We need a lot of help.
- [Nick] Yeah.

1114
00:47:29,291 --> 00:47:31,250
- You are under arrest.
- [Nick] No!

1115
00:47:32,125 --> 00:47:34,083
I can never tell
when you're being serious.

1116
00:47:34,083 --> 00:47:35,708
He looks serious. Are you serious?

1117
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:37,708
For kidnapping the Maharajah,

1118
00:47:37,708 --> 00:47:39,208
murdering his bodyguard,

1119
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:41,666
stealing $70 million,

1120
00:47:41,666 --> 00:47:43,916
destroying many city blocks,

1121
00:47:43,916 --> 00:47:46,041
and, I'm assuming,
sneaking into the opera.

1122
00:47:46,041 --> 00:47:48,916
- We didn't do all of that.
- We did number four and number six.

1123
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:50,458
We're just... We're being framed.

1124
00:47:50,458 --> 00:47:52,375
[Nick] We got a hunch who really did it.

1125
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:54,541
We need you to track
this license plate for us.

1126
00:47:54,541 --> 00:47:56,791
Nothing would give me greater pleasure,

1127
00:47:56,791 --> 00:48:00,958
but then I would have to immediately
report such help to my superiors,

1128
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,291
or I would be guilty
of aiding and abetting.

1129
00:48:03,291 --> 00:48:05,291
How's this? We can tie you up,

1130
00:48:05,291 --> 00:48:08,458
and then you can say
we forced you into helping us.

1131
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:09,708
[sighs]

1132
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:11,333
Wait, wait. Who are you calling?

1133
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:12,958
I'm not calling anyone.

1134
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:16,125
I have an app
to track the vehicle with that plate.

1135
00:48:16,125 --> 00:48:17,750
They have an app for that?

1136
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,041
- [Delacroix] Mm-hmm.
- Tsk!

1137
00:48:19,041 --> 00:48:21,541
God. You got Shazam on that after?

1138
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:23,791
I just... I wanna know what song this is.

1139
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:28,375
[Nick] So the app says
the truck is parked out by a château

1140
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:30,083
that's 80 kilometers away?

1141
00:48:30,083 --> 00:48:31,916
[Delacroix] Mm-hmm. Excuse me.

1142
00:48:31,916 --> 00:48:33,250
Can you scratch my nose?

1143
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,083
Oh.

1144
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:36,583
Uh... Uh, softer.

1145
00:48:36,583 --> 00:48:39,250
Softer. Hmm. [moaning]

1146
00:48:41,375 --> 00:48:43,916
- Thank you.
- Also, do you have a car we can borrow?

1147
00:48:44,583 --> 00:48:46,458
- The keys are in my pants pocket.
- [Audrey] Okay.

1148
00:48:46,458 --> 00:48:49,958
You talking to Audrey on that one too?
I'll handle the pants pocket.

1149
00:48:49,958 --> 00:48:52,583
What can I say?
[chuckles] Shooters gotta shoot.

1150
00:48:52,583 --> 00:48:53,625
[Nick chuckles]

1151
00:48:53,625 --> 00:48:56,833
Okay, is this a potato or a key
'cause I'm... Okay, got it.

1152
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,625
- [Audrey] We'll take care of it.
- Hey, hey.

1153
00:48:58,625 --> 00:49:00,416
Okay, no food in my car.

1154
00:49:02,041 --> 00:49:05,625
[Nick] Man, I bet Delacroix's
got a sick-ass vehicle.

1155

Bonsoir, Inspector.

00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:20,791
- Bonsoir, Colonel!
<i>- Enchanté!</i>

1162
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:27,750
The police are looking for you.

1163
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,625
Yeah, no kidding.
Colonel, we did not do this.

1164
00:49:30,625 --> 00:49:31,708
[Colonel] <i>I know that,</i>

1165
00:49:31,708 --> 00:49:34,291
but they have your fingerprints
all over the murder weapon

1166
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:36,666
and footage of you
running out of the tent with it.

1167
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:39,916
- [Nick] Yeah.
- Typical Spitz vacation insanity.

1168
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:42,083
Miller's dead, by the way,
and we lost the money.

1169
00:49:42,083 --> 00:49:43,666
It just looks like you took it.

1170

<i>It gets worse! The kidnappers just called.
They've given us</i>

00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,750
a midnight deadline
to come up with the money,

1172
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:50,333
or they will kill the Maharajah.

1173
00:49:50,333 --> 00:49:52,833
Okay, Colonel,
will you just stall for us until then?

1174
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:55,083
- [Nick] <i>Merci beaucoup!</i>
- [Audrey] <i>Thank you, Colonel!</i>

Oh my God!

1177
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:13,041
Well, now you know why
the kidnapper needs $70 million.

1178
00:50:13,041 --> 00:50:14,416
For the heating bill.

Oh boy.

1181
00:50:20,416 --> 00:50:24,333
Okay, so that moat's, like, three meters?

1182
00:50:24,833 --> 00:50:26,041
I think I can clear that.

1183
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:28,333
Nick, three meters is, like, ten feet.

1184
00:50:28,333 --> 00:50:30,916
I had the high school record
for the long jump.

1185
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:33,958
And I'm not kidding.
I went further than that back in the day.

1186
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,833
- Hmm. Did you?
- Yeah.

1187

What'd they call you back then?
"Nicky Long Legs"?

[Audrey] You're not gonna make that jump.

It doesn't make me feel good
to prove you wrong, but I'm gonna.

- All right?
- [Audrey] Mm-hmm.

1192
00:50:49,083 --> 00:50:52,125
Okay, from that angle,
it does look further than three meters.

1193
00:50:52,125 --> 00:50:53,541
- Oh shoot.
- What do you think?

1194
00:50:53,541 --> 00:50:56,958
- Do you think maybe you could do it?
- Now you want me to make that jump?

[gun cocks]

[both] Yeah.

1200
00:51:03,875 --> 00:51:05,833
- Did you hear we just said...
- [both] "Countess?"

1201

Oh God.

Where's Vik?

1204
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,750
I guess the kidnappers have him.

1205
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:17,708
Kid... You're not the kidnappers?

1206
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:18,791
No, no, no.

1207
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:22,416
I would never do such a thing.
Vikram is my friend.

1208
00:51:22,416 --> 00:51:23,541
[scoffs] Your friend.

1209
00:51:24,041 --> 00:51:24,958
You loved him.

1210
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,750
[coughing] Oh God!

1211
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:29,541
- I love money.
- Hmm, hmm, hmm.

1212
00:51:29,541 --> 00:51:32,666
When I heard you two amateurs
are gonna be handling so much of it,

1213
00:51:32,666 --> 00:51:33,791
I just had to have it.

1214
00:51:33,791 --> 00:51:35,916
"Had to have it." [giggles]

1215
00:51:35,916 --> 00:51:38,708
- So you didn't plant that knife?
- Or deepfake that footage?

1216
00:51:38,708 --> 00:51:41,208
Or slip something
into our drinks that night at the villa?

1217
00:51:41,208 --> 00:51:44,916
- Why bring that up? It's not relevant.
- [Audrey] Of course that is relevant!

1218
00:51:44,916 --> 00:51:47,625
- It's extremely relev--
- All right! All right! Jesus!

1219
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,541
- God!
- [Nick] Yo.

1220
00:51:48,541 --> 00:51:50,750
Two bad guys never works out.

1221
00:51:50,750 --> 00:51:53,791
- One always double-crosses the other.

00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:45,375
to cover all those paternity suits
for your 2,000 children.

1376
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,916
I say we make it 2,001, huh?

1377
00:58:47,916 --> 00:58:48,958
Get out of my face.

If I wanted money,
don't you think I'd just marry him?

1383
00:58:59,291 --> 00:59:01,916
Not with that brutal prenup
the board had you sign.

1384
00:59:03,333 --> 00:59:05,916
But what about the Colonel?
What's his motive?

1385
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:10,916
Well, maybe he just is sick of working
for rich people 'cause you guys suck.

1386
00:59:11,666 --> 00:59:17,500
Or maybe the Colonel needed enough money
to afford himself

1387
00:59:18,541 --> 00:59:19,958
a bionic arm.

1388
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:23,458
I looked into it.
They're not very expensive.

1389
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:26,166
- How much are we talking?
- Twenty, thirty K.

1390
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:29,208
That's it? Jeez, maybe I should get
something like that.

1391
00:59:29,208 --> 00:59:31,125
You're gonna have to lose an arm for that.

1392
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,916
I wasn't talking about for the arm.

1393

[chuckles]

1394
00:59:35,166 --> 00:59:38,291
Okay, we went through everybody.

1395
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:40,625
Who did it?

Oh my God.

Enough to blow
this whole damn tower up, G.

1405
01:00:00,166 --> 01:00:05,291
So check it. You gotta put the Benjamins
in the lift and send it to the top floor.

1406
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:09,208
Once the amount has been chickity-checked,
they'll send down the, uh...

God, what's it called?
The button blaster thingy? The--

- The remote detonator?
- Yes, that shit.

1409
01:00:14,208 --> 01:00:17,333
They'll send that back down,
and then we can be outtie.

1410
01:00:17,333 --> 01:00:21,583
And it's a bit of a hurry or something
because, you know...

- [all] Oh no!
- [Audrey] Oh my God, Nick!

You must put it in the elevator.

- Now!
- Nah.

1414

- "Nah"?
- What do you mean, "nah"?

- What are you doing?
- I don't think they'll blow him up.

Nick, are you really just going
on a hunch right now?

Whoever did this

'Cause he killed Mr. Lou, a lethal badass.

No, no. Nick, Nick, Nick!

1424
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:51,625
And we know the kidnapper
had some major hacking skills

1425
01:00:51,625 --> 01:00:53,625
to access that footage
and do the deepfake.

Come on, Nick!

1427
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:59,791
He knew exactly where to find
Mr. Lou and Vik backstage at the wedding

1428
01:00:59,791 --> 01:01:02,291
in order to pull off

Chapter 9, section 3,

You read the book.

From cover to cover, sweetheart,

Very impressive.

How did you get out of that SUV

I didn't.

01:02:02,708 --> 01:02:05,500
I climbed into a bomb-proof
titanium chamber in the back seat.

1452
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:09,541
A public death. What better way
to eliminate himself as a suspect.

Yeah, yeah. But everything didn't go

even for a countess.

So she sends Imani over
to hijack the hijackers.

- [both] Imani.

Now, if you had, in fact,
read my book properly,

1472
01:02:52,416 --> 01:02:56,875
you'd remember that revealing the identity
of a heretofore anonymous criminal

puts all those privy
