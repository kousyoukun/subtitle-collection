{\an8}<i>[Elle and Noah shouting]</i>

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,125
<i>[Elle] </i>{\an8}Well, after graduation,

6
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:24,541
{\an8}<i>Noah, Lee, Rachel and I decided</i>
<i>to take one week and go on a road trip,</i>

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,125
{\an8}<i>just the four of us.</i>

8
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:28,791
{\an8}<i>And while I was busy putting off</i>
<i>the inevitable decision</i>

9
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:31,791
{\an8}<i>between the two colleges</i>
<i>where I got accepted…</i>

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,166
{\an8}<i>[Lee] So, what about you?</i>

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,000
{\an8}<i>I-- I got wait-listed.</i>

12
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,666
{\an8}<i>Both Berkeley and Harvard.</i>

13
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:41,666
{\an8}<i>I was fully focused on making sure</i>
<i>we all had as much fun as possible.</i>

14
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,458
<i>-[shouts]</i>
<i>-[Elle] </i>{\an8}And that's exactly what we did.

15
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,458
{\an8}<i>Let me run you through the highlights.</i>

16
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:49,583
{\an8}<i>On our way up to Northern California,</i>
<i>we camped in the woods.</i>

17
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:51,708
<i>-[Lee] Hey!</i>
<i>-[Elle] </i>{\an8}Went fishing on a lake.

18
00:00:51,791 --> 00:00:54,791
{\an8}<i>Fed some wildlife,</i>
<i>caught some waves at Big Sur.</i>

19
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,958
{\an8}<i>Watched Noah becoming friends with Rachel.</i>

20
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:59,541
{\an8}<i>Watched Lee watch Noah</i>
<i>becoming friends with Rachel.</i>

21
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:01,583
{\an8}<i>Watched a shooting star</i>
<i>with someone special.</i>

22
00:01:01,666 --> 00:01:02,500
{\an8}<i>Oh, my God!</i>

23
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,000
{\an8}<i>Saw the fish at the aquarium in Monterey.</i>

24
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,666
{\an8}<i>Saw a sunset with colors</i>
<i>I had never seen before.</i>

25
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,250
<i>And got a reminder</i>
<i>about rule number 19. </i>{\an8}[sighs]

26
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,416
{\an8}<i>Decided to think about it later.</i>

27
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,083
<i>-Drove to San Francisco.</i>
{\an8}-[bell ringing]

28
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:19,583
{\an8}<i>Went to Fisherman's Wharf.</i>

29
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,083
<i>-Ate clam chowder out of a bread bowl.</i>
{\an8}-[all chattering]

30
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,375
<i>-</i>[Elle] <i>Watched the sea lions on Pier 39.</i>
{\an8}-[animals bark]

31
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:26,875
{\an8}<i>Watched our naughty video</i>
<i>from chemistry lab.</i>

32
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,166
<i>[chuckles] </i>Destroyed our naughty video
{\an8}from chemistry lab.

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,625
<i>-Rode tandem bikes in Golden Gate Park.</i>
{\an8}-[laughing]

34
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,208
<i>[Elle]</i> Rode a speedboat in the bay.

35
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,958
<i>-Caught a movie.</i>
{\an8}-[laughing]

36
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:36,333
<i>-Caught a concert.</i>
{\an8}-[cheering]

37
00:01:36,416 --> 00:01:39,375
<i>[Elle] </i>Even caught a baseball
{\an8}in a kayak outside Oracle Park…

38
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:40,541
{\an8}<i>Whoa, whoa!</i>

39
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,208
{\an8}<i>-[Lee] It's coming!</i>
<i>-I got it! [gasps]</i>

40
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,333
{\an8}<i>-Whoa.</i>
<i>-[Lee] Whoa!</i>

41
00:01:44,416 --> 00:01:46,166
{\an8}<i>-[stadium fans cheering]</i>
<i>-Oh, my God!</i>

42
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,875
{\an8}<i>Oh, my God!</i>

43
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,958
{\an8}<i>But the absolute best</i>
<i>was watching the Bay Lights</i>

44
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:53,708
{\an8}<i>with my favorite two guys in the world.</i>

45
00:01:55,875 --> 00:01:58,125
{\an8}<i>But when you decide to escape reality,</i>

46
00:01:58,208 --> 00:02:00,750
{\an8}<i>you know that eventually</i>
<i>you're gonna have to come back to it.</i>

47
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,666
{\an8}<i>So, when we got back home,</i>

48
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,666
{\an8}<i>I got a job so I could make some money</i>
<i>for college,</i>

49
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,541
{\an8}<i>whichever one I wind up going to.</i>

50
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:08,458
{\an8}<i>Oh, hey, guys…</i>

51
00:02:08,541 --> 00:02:10,708
{\an8}<i>But as hard as that was for me to decide,</i>

52
00:02:10,791 --> 00:02:13,458
<i>a few days later</i>{\an8},
<i>things got even more complicated</i>

53
00:02:13,541 --> 00:02:16,208
{\an8}<i>when Noah asked</i>
<i>a very unexpected question…</i>

54
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,125
<i>Mmm!</i>

55
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:20,208
<i>So, anyway, I was thinking, uh…</i>

56
00:02:20,291 --> 00:02:22,583
<i>when you get off the wait-list</i>
<i>for Harvard, maybe you and I</i>

57
00:02:22,666 --> 00:02:26,625
<i>could go off-campus</i>
<i>and get an apartment together.</i>

58
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:31,416
<i>Wait. You mean, like…</i>
<i>like, get our own place?</i>

59
00:02:32,583 --> 00:02:34,750
<i>Yeah, look. [clears throat]</i>

60
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:37,958
<i>I've been online all day.</i>
<i>There's some pretty cool places.</i>

61
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:41,750
<i>What?</i>

62
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:45,458
<i>-You wanna live with me?</i>
<i>-No.</i>

63
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:49,125
<i>[laughs] Yes, of course I wanna live</i>
<i>with you. I wanna do everything with you.</i>

64
00:02:49,208 --> 00:02:51,208
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yes, really.</i>

65
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,166
<i>-How long do we have till Lee gets back?</i>
<i>-I don't know.</i>

66
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,708
<i>[Elle sighs, laughs]</i>

67
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:57,166
<i>Geronimo!</i>

68
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,166
<i>-No, no, no, no, no, no! [screams]</i>
<i>-[Noah] Oh, shit!</i>

69
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,666
<i>[laughing]</i>

70
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,791
<i>-Hey, guys. Look what I got.</i>
<i>-Ooh!</i>

00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:05,833
<i>[chuckles]</i>

72
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,500

75
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,083
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

76
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:16,916
<i>Yeah, fine.</i>

77
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,000
<i>-Um, in fact…</i>
<i>-Hmm.</i>

00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,166
<i>[whispers]</i>

79
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,625
<i>-Yes, I would like that very much.</i>
<i>-Yeah, I thought you might.</i>

80
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,500
<i>-See you.</i>
<i>-Where are you two going?</i>

81
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:30,458
<i>Hmm. Noah wants to read me poetry</i>
<i>and tell me all about his feelings.</i>

82
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:32,625
<i>-Really? Is that what you wanna go with?</i>
<i>-[clattering]</i>

<i>-[Lee] Smooth move!</i>

85
00:03:36,208 --> 00:03:38,125

86
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:39,291
<i>[Rachel] What is it?</i>

87
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,708
<i>I have painstakingly coordinated</i>
<i>my Berkeley schedule</i>

88
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,333
<i>with your Rhode Island School of Design</i>
<i>schedule.</i>

89
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,208
<i>-[Rachel] Aww.</i>
<i>-First up, we've got Labor Day.</i>

90
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,166
<i>I know it's early in the semester,</i>
<i>but it's a long weekend,</i>

91
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,708
<i>and I'm pretty damn sure</i>
<i>I'm gonna be having my Rachel withdrawals.</i>

92
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:54,166
<i>That could work.</i>

93
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,083
<i>Of course it'll work. We'll make it work.</i>

94
00:03:57,166 --> 00:03:58,541
<i>[Rachel] Okay.</i>

95
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:02,916
<i>This place is so nice.</i>
<i>Thank you for bringing us here.</i>

96
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,541
<i>Well, we wanted</i>
<i>to finally take you somewhere special</i>

97
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,500
<i>to help celebrate your graduation.</i>

98
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,333
<i>So, any big plans for the summer?</i>

99
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,250
<i>Well, actually, now that you mention it,</i>

100
00:04:12,333 --> 00:04:15,333
<i>we were all talking about heading over</i>
<i>to the beach house this weekend,</i>

101
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:16,708
<i>if that's cool.</i>

102
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,583
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

103
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:25,583
<i>Yeah, everything's fine.</i>
<i>Um, we just have some news for you.</i>

104
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,000
<i>We are planning to sell the beach house.</i>

105
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,833
<i>[all] What?!</i>

106
00:04:30,916 --> 00:04:33,208
<i>It doesn't make sense</i>
<i>to hold on to it anymore.</i>

107
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,541
<i>Now that you kids</i>
<i>are going off to college.</i>

108
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,791
<i>You know, the upkeep</i>
<i>on the place is hardly worth it</i>

109
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:39,500
<i>since we're not even gonna be there.</i>

110
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:43,166
<i>Truth is</i>
<i>the whole area is being redeveloped.</i>

111
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,083
<i>You know what you sound like, Mom?</i>
<i>You sound like a realtor.</i>

112
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,041
<i>That's because I </i>am<i> a realtor.</i>

113
00:04:48,125 --> 00:04:51,625
<i>Wait, so where are we gonna watch</i>
<i>the fireworks on the Fourth of July?</i>

114
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:54,250
<i>No, I'm sorry. I'm putting my foot down.</i>
<i>You guys are not selling.</i>

115
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:55,625
<i>I gotta go with Lee on this one.</i>

116
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:58,250
<i>This house has been in our family</i>
<i>for, like, 80 years.</i>

117
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,416
<i>You can't just get rid of it like that.</i>

118
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,541
<i>Is this a vote? Because I vote "no."</i>

119
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,041
<i>I'm sorry, guys.</i>

120
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:06,875
<i>It's been decided.</i>

121
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,000
<i>-[sighs]</i>
<i>-[cell phone vibrating]</i>

122
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,875
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

123
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,416
<i>-Hello?</i>
<i>-[exhales]</i>

124
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,041
<i>Miss Evans, this is Don Washington</i>
<i>from UC Berkeley's admissions.</i>

125
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,916
<i>I'm following up</i>
<i>on your decision regarding Berkeley.</i>

126
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,875
<i>Uh, yes. Hi.</i>

127
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:31,166
<i>Um, is there any way</i>
<i>I could just get another small extension?</i>

128
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:32,958
<i>I'm very sorry, Miss Evans,</i>

129
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:36,041
<i>but we need your decision</i>
<i>by end of business day tomorrow.</i>

130
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,250
<i>[Elle] </i>I knew that I couldn't hide
from it any longer.

131
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,875
<i>Uh, okay. I understand.</i>

132
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,291
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-[Don] </i>All right.

133
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,250
<i>[Elle] </i>The next day,
I had to pick a school

134
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,916
<i>and make one</i>
<i>of my two favorite people very unhappy.</i>

135
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:50,916
<i>I'ma hit you with a "draw four,"</i>
<i>"draw two." Uno, Uno out.</i>

136
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,458
<i>-[Mr. Evans] Oh, no!</i>
<i>-What? Gosh!</i>

137
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,958
<i>Let's go. [grunts]</i>

138
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:56,625
<i>-Did he cheat?</i>
<i>-[Brad] Unh-unh.</i>

139
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,291
<i>-[laughing]</i>
<i>-Aww. I miss this.</i>

140
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,208
<i>I feel like I barely see you guys anymore.</i>

141
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,625
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

142
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,875
<i>-They're keeping you busy at work.</i>
<i>-Very busy.</i>

143
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:07,291
<i>But don't worry,</i>
<i>I'm still good to babysit tomorrow.</i>

144
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:11,750
<i>Do you think you're gonna be working</i>
<i>a lot of weekends with this new job?</i>

145
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,875
<i>Uh, yeah, looks that way.</i>

146
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:15,833
<i>Uh, but I'm not working tomorrow night.</i>

147
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,208
<i>I got a date.</i>

148
00:06:17,875 --> 00:06:18,916
<i>[Elle] </i>A date?

149
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,916
<i>-Really?</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

150
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,416
<i>Um, how many dates have you been on</i>
<i>with this mystery person?</i>

151
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,041
<i>A few. Her name is Linda.</i>

152
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:30,000
<i>Interesting.</i>

153
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:33,500
<i>Well, obviously, we,</i>

154
00:06:33,583 --> 00:06:38,208
<i>Brad, are gonna have</i>
<i>to give you a curfew, young man.</i>

155
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:41,000
<i>-Okay. Understood, ma'am.</i>
<i>-[both laugh]</i>

156
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:48,750
<i>[Elle] </i>The next day,
we all drove down to the beach house

157
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,708

488
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,583
<i>Yeah, we go up to Berkeley.</i>
<i>We'll find an apartment, get set up.</i>

<i>Well, Chloe's actually gonna be in town,</i>

540
00:25:26,208 --> 00:25:30,500

<i>Is that okay with you?</i>

542
00:25:33,666 --> 00:25:35,583
<i>Yeah. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, absolutely.</i>

00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:39,458
<i>As far as I'm concerned,</i>
<i>that is-- that's ancient history.</i>

544
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:41,833

<i>Okay, so, totally random.</i>

547
00:25:45,041 --> 00:25:47,208
<i>I ran into Marco and his family</i>
<i>eating at the restaurant,</i>

548
00:25:47,291 --> 00:25:50,208
<i>and he actually has a job</i>
<i>at the water park.</i>

549
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,750
<i>So he's gonna help us</i>
<i>with this cool bucket list thingy.</i>

<i>Wait, that's--</i>

552
00:25:58,666 --> 00:26:02,083
<i>That's kind of a double standard.</i>
<i>I was totally fine with Chloe.</i>

553
00:26:02,791 --> 00:26:04,416
<i>Well, I didn't kiss Chloe.</i>

554

<i>I'm-- I'm really sorry.</i>

00:26:22,083 --> 00:26:22,958
<i>It's okay.</i>

<i>Let's just drop it, okay?</i>

<i>-Yeah, yeah, I'll come.</i>
<i>-Okay.</i>

564

<i>And since you're going,</i>

565
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,750
<i>you can help Lee and I</i>

<i>Oh, God. What-- what is it?</i>

<i>-I'll let Lee fill you in.</i>
<i>-No.</i>

<i>And that's our epic plan for race day.</i>

571
00:26:59,791 --> 00:27:02,458
<i>So, will you help us?</i>

572
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,583
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

00:27:06,125 --> 00:27:09,166

<i>-Look, Lee, I'm not gonna wear a costume.</i>

<i>What?</i>

<i>Did you really expect him to do it?</i>

583
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,500
<i>Well, yeah, I thought that, you know,</i>
<i>maybe this time he would actually--</i>

<i>Bye. Have fun.</i>

<i>What if we were to apply that</i>

1843
01:38:32,375 --> 01:38:34,541
<i>Players could get together</i>
<i>at the beginning of the season</i>

<i>and take turns drafting</i>
<i>their favorite pro players.</i>

<i>And you could even call it</i>
<i>"Fantas-E Sports."</i>

1846
01:38:41,166 --> 01:38:45,416
<i>And fantasy football's, like,</i>
<i>a multimillion-dollar industry, right?</i>

1847
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:48,166
<i>It's $7 billion actually.</i>

<i>See? There you go.</i>

1849
01:38:51,541 --> 01:38:54,791
<i>And how much</i>

<i>Uh, two billion.</i>
