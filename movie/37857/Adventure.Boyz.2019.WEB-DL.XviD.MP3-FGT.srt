You've been ages.

516
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:08,999
Are you okay?

517
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,136
I was thinking, you know,
    if you want to have a go

518
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,138
at the goggle-pad,
       it's okay with me.

519
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,308
Maybe like, uh, ten minute
      slots or something?

How did they find them?

Maybe the note that blew away?

523
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:25,916
What?

524
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:29,453
I was halfway through writing
   the note for the exchange,

525
00:31:29,455 --> 00:31:33,423
and I wanted to be outside,
  you know, around the bloom.

526
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,927
Flowers are amazing
     at this time of year.

I didn't want to miss out.

528
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,100
And the wind picked up
       and blew it away.

529
00:31:43,636 --> 00:31:46,103
I tried to grab it,
        but it was gone.

00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,071
I thought it got stuck
   in a bush somewhere, so...

00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:50,307

      to hide the diamonds
  in the first place, was it?

wanted to be a criminal anyway.

The speedway rider, look!

This must be his house.

Oh, my God.

00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:51,294
I was at the Euro
       Championships '94.

706
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:54,230
He was three bikes back,
     then on the last lap,
 he canes it up on the inside,

   doesn't touch the ground.

Boom, right on the line,
    he takes from Henshall.

It was just beautiful.
          [chuckling]

     -No, no, no, no, wait.

00:44:06,111 --> 00:44:07,110
This is perfect.

713
00:44:07,646 --> 00:44:09,779
Harris hasn't won for a while.

714
00:44:09,781 --> 00:44:12,081
All these new kids,
        younger, faster,

715
00:44:12,083 --> 00:44:14,951
I bet he hasn't won
   any prize money for yonks.

716
00:44:14,953 --> 00:44:17,220
I hear his sponsor pulled out
   and backed some other kid.

717
00:44:17,222 --> 00:44:18,788
What are you talking about?

718
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:25,662
No one knows who took
        those diamonds.

719
00:44:26,297 --> 00:44:29,399
If the police think he did,
  and it makes perfect sense,

720
00:44:29,401 --> 00:44:31,768
he would need another
       source of income.

721
00:44:33,271 --> 00:44:36,773
So... I'll make an anonymous
      call to the police,

722
00:44:36,775 --> 00:44:40,276
tell them that I know for
  a fact that Mike Harris has

723
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:43,880
the diamonds and he has them
 right there in his very house.

724
00:44:44,282 --> 00:44:48,051
They'll go there, find the
 diamonds for us, the diamonds,

725
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:50,053
they'll end up in
  the evidence room for what?

726
00:44:50,055 --> 00:44:51,821
Two, three days
      before they've done

727
00:44:51,823 --> 00:44:53,423
the paperwork, and then
      they'll return them.

728
00:44:53,425 --> 00:44:54,824
How do you know that?

729
00:44:56,061 --> 00:44:58,327
Because my mom works down
    at that police station.

730
00:44:58,329 --> 00:44:59,696
Your mom works for the police?

731
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,465
As a cleaner.

732
00:45:02,467 --> 00:45:06,069
She's cool and she's
        very supportive.

733
00:45:06,738 --> 00:45:09,872
And the other thing is, she
can get into that evidence room

734
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:14,444
on her cleaning duties, which
 happens to be tomorrow night.

735
00:45:14,446 --> 00:45:18,214
She can slip the diamonds back
    to us, and from then on,

736
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,382
we're in the clear.

737
00:45:19,984 --> 00:45:23,119
Meanwhile, Mike Harris
        will be speeding

and the law is there
     to protect you and us.
