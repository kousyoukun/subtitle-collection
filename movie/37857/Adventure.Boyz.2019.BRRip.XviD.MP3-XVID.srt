1
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:48,055
This magnificent castle is
now officially a crime scene.

2
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,524
90 extremely rare and highly
valuable diamonds that have

3
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,695
been in the hurst family for
generations have been stolen

4
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:58,239
from this high security
tower right here behind me.

5
00:01:58,327 --> 00:02:01,535
Police are appealing for any
information that could lead towards

6
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:04,238
the arrest of these criminals
or criminal involved

7
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,413
in this despicable crime.

8
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,201
Lady hurst was unavailable
for comment,

9
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:12,083
but those close to her
say that she is devastated

10
00:02:12,174 --> 00:02:14,711
by the loss of these gems
that were handed down

11
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,008
to her as a child
by her late mother.

12
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:43,235
Are your arms broken? =no.

13
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,945
Are your legs broken?

14
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
No.

15
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:49,037
Are you alive?

16
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,537
Yes.

17
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,709
Then let's go.

18
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:53,128
Somehow daddy was always

19
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:55,706
there to pick us up
and dust us off.

20
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:57,883
It wasn't always like this.

21
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,210
Let me give you some context.

22
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:03,263
It was that summer when the
green turned to golden brown.

23
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,810
We actually live in Glen close.

24
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:12,105
It's the same name as some
American movie actress,

25
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,682
apparently quite talented.

26
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:17,315
We've won the lottery of life,
dad says.

27
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:22,112
He says there are people
starving, no water in the tap,

28
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,535
let alone england's greenest
hills and beautiful views.

29
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:27,658
There's a saying, "you've don't

30
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,580
know what you've got
till it's gone.”

31
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,330
Well, I was soon going to
understand what that meant.

32
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:35,962
You don't know me yet,
but my name is Sam.

33
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,624
This is my brother, Jake.

34
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,051
Cute, they all say.

35
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:42,719
These guys are
the reasons our parents

36
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,469
invented neighborhood
watch, dodgy.

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,097
This guy, I've got a four
letter word for him.

38
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,678
Actually, it's five letters.

39
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,513
I was never that
good at spelling.

40
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:56,099
We'll come back to them.
You yell if you see them around.

41
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,815
Tnis is my mom,

42
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,111
that's my school.

43
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,197
My mom is the sensible one.

44
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,533
I'nat's a good quality
for a mommy.

45
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,906
Daddy, however,
is a bit different.

46
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:09,704
He's a speedway racer.

47
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,121
Mommy thinks he should stop,
but he loves it too much.

48
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:17,379
You know, these speedway
bikes don't even have brakes.

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,166
Tne only breaks are
your bones, mom says.

50
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,513
He used to be a champ,

51
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,187
but that was long before
we came along.

52
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,730
It's been so long
since he's won,

53
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,682
his trophies are gathering dust.

54
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,353
Something happened
with mommy and daddy.

55
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:43,439
I don't know what exactly,
but grownups are funny.

56
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:47,367
Everything is a military
operation to him.

57
00:04:47,454 --> 00:04:49,820
He even cuts the hedge
like he's on a mission.

58
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,496
He has a machine in the garage,

59
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,199
but he insists on using
these big green scissors.

60
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,870
He treats everything as exercise
and a test of precision.

61
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:04,339
He's got this crazy
American car.

62
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,920
He loves that car.

63
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:09,631
Mom says he loves it
more than her.

64
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,183
Dad seems obsessed with America.

65
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,680
He met mom there and they drove

66
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:15,683
around America
in this big old car.

67
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,270
Apparently, I was made
in the back seat or something,

68
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,317
but I really don't want
fo talk about that.

69
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,191
Apparently it's the exact
car that was used

70
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:28,150
in some American movie, staring
clive eastman or something,

71
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,156
put I can't quite
remember its hame.

72
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,664
It's Clint, Clint Eastwood,

73
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:37,083
and he's the finest movie
star who ever lived.

74
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:41,171
And because of his movies,
he'll always live.

75
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,591
It's so precious,
he won't even drive it.

76
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,045
He's a bit of a joker.

77
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,678
He used to set traps with
string and stuff like that.

78
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,269
- Seriously?
- Hmm.

79
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:04,027
One Halloween,
he pulled this gag.

80
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:05,979
Why don't we go to the park?

81
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,287
Oh, Jake, I'm sorry.

82
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,040
It's just a silly mask, okay?

83
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:21,203
Just a silly mask.

84
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:22,298
I'm so sorry.

85
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,043
Jake cried for hours.

86
00:06:25,719 --> 00:06:27,129
That morning before
it all happened,

87
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,085
a bird circled the house.

88
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:31,721
I should have known
it was a sign.

89
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,349
Apparently these signs
are everywhere,

90
00:06:36,313 --> 00:06:38,099
if only we knew where to look.

91
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:40,893
So, mom's off back to America.

92
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:42,599
Oh, bye, boys.

93
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,313
- You be good for daddy, okay?
- Okay.

94
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,303
This is the moment daddy
should have stopped

95
00:06:50,327 --> 00:06:53,034
mommy leaving, but he didn't.

96
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,861
I love you guys.

97
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,601
Come on. - They
think we don't notice

98
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,866
the looks they give
each other behind our backs,

99
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,995
but we do.

100
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,380
I've become something
of a lip reading expert.

101
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:07,708
A skill I had no ambition
to acquire,

102
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,146
put it was going to
prove more of a lifesaver

103
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,011
than I ever could have imagined.

104
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,475
So, it's dad's big race
in less than a week.

105
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,723
Mom normally does
all the kid stuff,

106
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,645
so she thinks leaving
us with him

107
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:23,849
will stop dad practicing
for his race.

108
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,485
But I don't think she knows
that man as well as she thinks.

109
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,772
Ladies and gentlemen,

110
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,404
good afternoon and welcome
to Arlington stadium.

111
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:38,739
An afternoon of fun,
thrills and speedway.

112
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:43,957
But of course, we have to
welcome our resident champion,

113
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,959
the one and only Kevin Jenkins!

114
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,977
Everyone loved
this new champ, but I think

115
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,506
he loved himself
just a little too much.

116
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,599
Come on. Come on!

117
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,733
And as usual, he won again.

118
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,840
Dad says it's just
about the taking part.

119
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:58,826
But I could see something
was breaking his heart.

120
00:09:13,011 --> 00:09:14,876
Shouldn't you be at home
changing diapers

121
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,427
or whatever it is daddies do?

122
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,800
I came second, didn't I?

123
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,175
You think second
is winning, huh?

124
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,555
What is your problem?

125
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:25,891
It's a young man's game.

126
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,525
Go and do something
important, daddy.

127
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:40,827
My dad used to have sponsors.

128
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:43,246
There was interviews
on TV and everything,

129
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,994
but guess who gets all that now?

130
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:46,746
Look at all of these landscapes,

131
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,953
and America is so huge,
you know, england would fit

132
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,336
into one of these states
and there are 50 of them.

133
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,382
Can you imagine
the biking we could do?

134
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,012
You know that man
at the stadium?

135
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,100
Yeah.

136
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,551
Why was he being mean to you?

137
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:05,686
Ah, don't worry about him.

138
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,563
Some people are just like that.

139
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,647
Why didn't you do anything?

140
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,271
Like what, hit him?

141
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,522
Mm.

142
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:17,401
You can't just go around
hitting people.

143
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,817
Violence is almost
never the answer,

144
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:23,449
unless we're talking
about an absolute bully.

145
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,202
Are you allowed to hit a bully?

146
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,249
Well, not officially.

147
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:33,376
I mean... don't tell
your mom I ever said this,

148
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,331
definitely don't tell
any teachers,

149
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,417
but if there's a really
nasty piece of work

150
00:10:37,512 --> 00:10:39,844
and you've tried
everything else,

151
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:41,796
there's really only
one way to stop them.

152
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,723
But you have to do it right.

153
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:45,811
Tell us.

154
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,607
Right there,
straight on those nose

155
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,396
with everything you've got.

156
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,897
It doesn't matter
how big you are,

157
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:58,484
a whack to the nose
and you're down.

158
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:01,403
But I didn't tell you that.

159
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,155
Goodnight, boys.

160
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,291
Come on, it's the finals, Lucy,

161
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:15,382
you know that.

162
00:11:16,301 --> 00:11:18,087
But it's so dangerous.

163
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,806
I miss you.

164
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,549
Same here, okay?

165
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:30,020
I miss you, too,
but I need to race on Saturday.

166
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,392
It's what I've been
building up to.

167
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,519
Besides, it's good for the boys

168
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:36,727
to see some healthy competition.

169
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,857
Healthy?

170
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:41,360
It's noisy and it stinks!

171
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:45,986
Michael, you put
your life on the line

172
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,991
every time
you get on that thing.

173
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:52,709
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not 25 anymore.

174
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,161
I know.

175
00:11:55,256 --> 00:12:00,376
You're a father, you need
to start acting responsibly.

176
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:06,343
How would those boys
feel if the last thing

177
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:09,801
they saw of you
was a pile of dust?

178
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,975
What else do I do, Lucy?

179
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,144
What else am I good at?

180
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,606
I'm not even sure
how good I am at that anymore.

181
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:26,575
== - Sam's up, I've got to go.

182
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,538
- Okay.
- Okay, bye.

183
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,257
We were still getting out

184
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,348
and about on our bikes.

185
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,510
Until one day we discovered
something much better.

186
00:12:54,774 --> 00:13:01,316
Something new, something safer,
something easy to control.

187
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,574
We wouldn't even need
mom and dad to pick us up

188
00:13:06,661 --> 00:13:08,572
or dust us off.

189
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:18,085
What are you doing?

190
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,207
Playing tennis.

191
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,039
And what are you doing?

192
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,134
Playing football.

193
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,565
No, you're not,
your arms are not swinging,

194
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,343
your legs are not moving.

195
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:28,012
Let's go outside,
play some ball.

196
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,950
Are you angry?

197
00:13:51,122 --> 00:13:55,035
Look, I can play a boxing
game and it's fun,

198
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:56,787
put there's nothing like

199
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:58,618
actually punching that bag.

200
00:13:58,713 --> 00:14:00,920
The feeling in your lungs,
the exertion.

201
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:05,216
Look, Sam, those devices,
they're amazing.

202
00:14:05,303 --> 00:14:08,423
They've changed the world forever, the
people that have made them are geniuses,

203
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:11,347
but those geniuses did not
expect the children of today

204
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:13,595
to be sat there all day
staring into them.

205
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:19,807
Listen to me, you can
play 1,000 motorbike games

206
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,524
with your fingers, but you'll
never get the same feeling

207
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:25,979
as when you get on that bike,
you feel that engine roar,

208
00:14:26,074 --> 00:14:28,611
that air is your lungs,
dirt in your face.

209
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,532
That 1s adventure.

210
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:32,239
It's exercise.

211
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,785
And when I'm gone, I do not
want you boys just sat staring

212
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,958
into those screens
for the rest of your life.

213
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,588
Come here.

214
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,338
You want to punch the bag?

215
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:45,255
Mm-hmm.

216
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:46,753
All right, punch the bag.

217
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:51,129
Okay, you want
to punch really hard?

218
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,589
You don't punch the bag.

219
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,267
Look at me, you punch
through the bag.

220
00:15:00,817 --> 00:15:03,183
We didn't realize
at that moment,

221
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,110
what we were about to learn
would soon be used in a life

222
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,312
or death situation.

223
00:15:13,287 --> 00:15:15,619
That's it, come on.

224
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,697
Let's get this going.

225
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,034
Okay, boys, what is this?

226
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,711
A ball.

227
00:15:23,798 --> 00:15:27,006
It's not a ball, it's a
device to train your accuracy.

228
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,583
If you can catch
a ball at high speed,

229
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:30,669
you can anticipate
a turn, a bump,

230
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,674
you can react
at lightning speed.

231
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:34,676
Jake, you're up.

232
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,455
Yes!

233
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:03,613
Then the real training began.

234
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,622
So, what do you want to eat?

235
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,824
Sweets. Chocolate.

236
00:16:42,919 --> 00:16:44,409
Come with me.

237
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,461
To dad, this was
his worst nightmare.

238
00:16:52,887 --> 00:16:55,924
One day we might not do
anything for real.

239
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,552
In his eyes, something
drastic had to be done.

240
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,317
Look at all this,
this is energy food.

241
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:11,610
Look at all the colors.

242
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:15,068
Nature has made all these
amazing things for us.

243
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:18,117
Here, do you know how many trees
you can climb on one of these?

244
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:21,412
How many? - I don't know
exactly, but a lot more than you can

245
00:17:21,499 --> 00:17:23,035
on sweets and chocolate, okay?

246
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,495
Okay, boys, what is this?

247
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:31,171
- A piece of paper.
- Wrong again.

248
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,590
Everything is what you make it.

249
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:36,503
This is good exercise,
this is running in fields,

250
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:40,055
this is air in your lungs,
but you have to make it so.

251
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,957
You just never know where a little
piece of paper can take you.

252
00:17:57,535 --> 00:18:00,322
At first, it was just me,

253
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:06,245
then my best friend, then three,

254
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:09,494
then the whole class.

255
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,712
Even the girls joined in.

256
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,188
And then, there she was.

257
00:18:39,577 --> 00:18:41,113
I should've said something.

258
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:46,372
But I wasn't brave enough.

259
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,170
Not yet.

260
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,802
And when Christopher
Columbus was sailing

261
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:08,182
those seven seas,
he experienced things

262
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:10,934
that others could
only dream about.

263
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,233
Your next topic, I want you all

264
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,357
to think wisely about Columbus.

265
00:19:17,448 --> 00:19:21,407
How was he feeling when
just he had discovered

266
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:25,328
such a magnificent
and beautiful sight?

267
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:31,125
And master Samuel Harris,
if you spent just a little more

268
00:19:31,212 --> 00:19:34,545
time looking at your school
book than you do at Amelie,

269
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,338
you might just pass
with flying colors.

270
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,896
Uh... uh... um.

271
00:19:57,279 --> 00:19:59,144
Everything is what you make it.

272
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,650
You have to make it so.

273
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:03,357
Uh, do you want to come
to the races on Saturday?

274
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,580
No!

275
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,041
Okay.

276
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:17,538
Of
Course, I did that in private.

277
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,673
Somehow, my heart was beating

278
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:31,056
faster than ever at dad's after
school practice.

279
00:20:51,876 --> 00:20:54,413
- Hello, mommy.
- Hey, boys.

280
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,993
- Hello, mommy.
- How are you?

281
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,441
We've been flying
paper airplanes...

282
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,505
We've been going on

283
00:20:58,549 --> 00:20:59,789
bike rides in the fields.

284
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,545
We've been flying
through the air.

285
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,842
Daddy through the ball and... I

286
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,574
- I caught it, and then we...
- Paper airplanes.

287
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:07,213
Went to the field
and I did epic jumps.

288
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,180
We went over the ramp
with the scooter...

289
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,621
- We did bmxing through...
- We climbed the frame

290
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:12,725
loads of times. Uh, huh.

291
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:15,020
- And it was really fun.
- Uh, huh.

292
00:21:16,567 --> 00:21:19,229
And also, this girl, Amelie.
=uh, huh.

293
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,773
I asked her out
to daddy's race on Saturday.

294
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,695
Oh, yeah? Hmm.

295
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:26,740
Mommy misses you.

296
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,196
We miss you too, mommy.

297
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,739
We're going on a bike ride now.

298
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,937
- Bye, mommy.
- Going to go on a bike ride now.

299
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,326
- Bye, mom.
- I love you, boys.

300
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,752
Love you too, mom.

301
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:40,882
You be careful.

302
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,586
Bye, mom.

303
00:21:58,526 --> 00:22:01,142
Bye, daddy,
we're off to practice.

304
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,898
Oh, well, bye, boys.

305
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:04,444
Bye, daddy.

306
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,897
Be careful.

307
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:53,995
"Beyond the dark winamill,
two swallows hold the key."

308
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:58,040
Let's just leave it,
it's not meant for us.

309
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:00,079
Wait, the dark windmill,

310
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,536
that's the other side
of the downs.

311
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:04,496
Yeah, but that's miles away.

312
00:23:04,592 --> 00:23:06,628
Come on, let's investigate it.

313
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,539
Two swallows hold the key.

314
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,944
Look, over there!

315
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,222
"B13, midnight sparkles.”

316
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,523
B for books?

317
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,895
B for bad idea.

318
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,602
Come on, let's go back.

319
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,156
Wait.

320
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:59,328
B13, b13, there are 14
bunkers or kneecap hill.

321
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,958
Remember, we went on a walk
there with mom and dad.

322
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,956
That's miles away.

323
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,628
It's going to be
getting dark soon.

324
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:16,049
Remember, dad said we should be
having adventures.

325
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,926
Look, we've got a key,
let's at least investigate.

326
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,671
There's 12.

327
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,006
There, 13 this must be it.

328
00:25:58,849 --> 00:26:00,805
Look, there's something inside.

329
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,761
Oh, yeah, what is that?

330
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:29,830
Come on, boys.

331
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,501
No!

332
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:18,626
That can't be right.

333
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,213
It's hours until midnight.

334
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,473
L

335
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,063
There's someone in there.
You what?

336
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,482
Wow, diamonds.

337
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:36,068
Do you think they're real?

338
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,645
Well, how about we find out?

339
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:44,287
Are you sure?

340
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,910
Movement. =I don't know.

341
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:55,750
Oil -

342
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:56,841
oi!

343
00:28:03,432 --> 00:28:04,432
Come on.

344
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,553
Gee!

345
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,556
What the...

346
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,783
It's empty. =no.

347
00:28:27,873 --> 00:28:28,988
That's not possible.

348
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:30,242
Not without the key.

349
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,414
How have they got the key?

350
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,248
Are you okay?

351
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,796
Just, go get them!

352
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:41,883
Quick, they're coming.

353
00:28:52,606 --> 00:28:53,891
Ah, where they gone?

354
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,140
Hang on.

355
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,768
Catch.

356
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,451
- Right.
- Go, go, go.

357
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:14,582
Eh?

358
00:29:19,216 --> 00:29:21,332
That way. =t here.

359
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,210
Quick, now go.

360
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,850
What? Hey.

361
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,223
There he is, come here.

362
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,026
Run, Reynolds, run!

363
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,944
All right, come here.

364
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,896
Quick, come on, come on.

365
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:46,357
Power it, power it!

366
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:50,390
- Come here!
- Get the other one,

367
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,405
get the other one.

368
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,627
Freeze!

369
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,385
Come on!

370
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,971
Theyre getting away.

371
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,476
Down here.

372
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,279
Right.

373
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:47,970
We've lost them.

374
00:30:58,899 --> 00:31:00,355
Hello, daddy.

375
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,317
Hello, daddy. -
Hey, boys, wait a second.

376
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:06,190
Boys, I was worried about you.

377
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,281
You've been ages.

378
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,200
Are you okay?

379
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:13,194
I was thinking, you know,
if you want to have a go

380
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,199
at the goggle-pad,
it's okay with me.

381
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,908
Maybe like, uh, ten minute
slots or something?

382
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,117
Boss is going to kill us.

383
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,248
How did they find them?

384
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:24,629
Maybe the note that blew away?

385
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:25,922
What?

386
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,585
I was halfway through writing
the note for the exchange,

387
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:33,547
and I wanted to be outside,
you know, around the bloom.

388
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,266
Flowers are amazing
at this time of year.

389
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,394
1 didn't want to miss out.

390
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:43,144
And the wind picked up
and blew it away.

391
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,143
I tried to grab it,
but it was gone.

392
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,158
1 thought it got stuck
in a bush somewhere, so...

393
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,408
I wrote another.

394
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:54,159
Great.

395
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,984
You're meant to be the fastest,
you couldn't even grab them.

396
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,529
Well, it wasn't my idea to hide the
diamonds in the first place, was it?

397
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:12,215
Well, if it wasn't for me, we
wouldn't have even spotted the kids.

398
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,117
You were
the one that lost that note.

399
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,881
That note was a stupid idea.

400
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,457
Do you know, I never
wanted to be a criminal anyway.

401
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,135
I wanted to be a gardener.

402
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:23,393
I wanted to have a plot of land,
some tulips and some grass.

403
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:30,154
Yeah, but my mom saidq,
"you haven't got green fingers.

404
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,525
You've got sticky fingers."

405
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,072
=shut...

406
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,778
Up.

407
00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:38,362
Look at these things,
they could be worth a fortune.

408
00:32:38,457 --> 00:32:40,257
What do you think
we should do with the money?

409
00:32:43,462 --> 00:32:46,920
Right now those two little boys

410
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:50,215
are making fools of both of you.

411
00:32:51,595 --> 00:32:52,926
Buy a helicopter.

412
00:32:53,847 --> 00:32:56,213
Or even better, a private jet.

413
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,935
We could help the poor people
daddy tells us about.

414
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,820
With your share
of the profit, hmm?

415
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:21,780
You could buy a patch of
land that you could tend

416
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:24,617
for the remainder
of your living days.

417
00:33:25,295 --> 00:33:27,627
What do you think mommy
and daddy would want?

418
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:31,165
A trip to America,
no doubt about it.

419
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:37,174
But without it,
the only digging will be

420
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,473
that of two shallow graves.

421
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,682
One the size of your body.

422
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:50,563
And one half the size
of your body.

423
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,566
- Just half?
- Oh, yes.

424
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:03,785
Because the other half
will be stuffed and mounted

425
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:07,083
above my desk
as a warning to others

426
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:10,833
that mistakes will
not be tolerated.

427
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:17,593
Should we tell daddy?

428
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,047
No, let's just
keep it a surprise.

429
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,758
Do I make myself clear?

430
00:34:24,521 --> 00:34:26,887
Yeah, completely.

431
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,850
I mean, especially
the bit about the...

432
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:33,985
The other half body thing.

433
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,357
Just go!

434
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,023
Let's find out what
they're worth first.

435
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,740
Bring me my diamonds.

436
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,613
Or... those two boys.

437
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,230
Look, jewelry.

438
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,316
Surely, he'll know
how much it's worth.

439
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,446
- Ask him.
- No, you ask him.

440
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,243
- No, you ask him.
- No, you ask him.

441
00:35:24,331 --> 00:35:25,433
- No, you ask.
- No, you ask...

442
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,788
Can I help you?

443
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,746
Oh, uh, yes, we have
something to show you.

444
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,919
We want to know how
much it's worth.

445
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,542
It's worthless, I'm afraid.

446
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:15,839
Junk.

447
00:36:20,053 --> 00:36:22,715
You boys are after a bit
of pocket money, aren't you?

448
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,260
Well, I'll take it off
your hands for a tenner.

449
00:36:27,227 --> 00:36:29,718
Ten whole pound you didn't
have before you came in here.

450
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:34,981
No, thank you.

451
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:41,442
Okay, 50, 1007?

452
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:44,827
1,000?

453
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,329
Oh.

454
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:50,739
You're a good negotiator.

455
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,592
There they are.

456
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,092
That's, that's the antique shop.

457
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:04,972
Yes!

458
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,975
- Come on, they must've sold them.
- They, they've sold them?

459
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,213
Boo!

460
00:37:44,721 --> 00:37:47,053
Look, it's as I've told you.
They only had one

461
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,220
and they took it away!

462
00:38:01,738 --> 00:38:04,525
Those men,
they must be criminals.

463
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:05,822
What if they come here?

464
00:38:14,167 --> 00:38:16,453
Don't worry about them,
I got a plan.

465
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,401
What the hell are you doing?

466
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:33,318
These are begonias,
they're meant to be in bloom,

467
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:36,951
but look at them. - There's half a
million pounds of our diamonds in there,

468
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:40,203
and all you're worried
about is the blooming.

469
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,203
I'm just saying,
anyone prepared to let

470
00:39:43,298 --> 00:39:45,334
begonias get
in a state like this.

471
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,112
I'm just trying to figure out what
kind of people we're dealing with.

472
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:49,546
Dealing with?

473
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:51,397
When the boss finds out
that two snotty-nosed

474
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,838
little kids made off
with our diamonds,

475
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:57,509
- you'll know what we're dealing with.
- Don't be fooled.

476
00:39:57,604 --> 00:39:59,014
I need to relax.

477
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,221
Kick back.

478
00:40:07,864 --> 00:40:09,104
In the 1920's,

479
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,780
kids went up chimneys,
down coal mines,

480
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:14,450
their blackened faces
risking more life than limb,

481
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,152
than any adult ever could.

482
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:19,201
They work for big powerful
businessmen.

483
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:20,327
On a bmx?

484
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:26,459
Just saying, kids work
for drug cartels

485
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:28,710
on, on, on roller skates!

486
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:36,552
Just be careful, that's all.

487
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:43,351
Just tread carefully,
there's a light on.

488
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,864
You boys had me worried.

489
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:03,371
Are you sure there's
nothing you need to tell me?

490
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,954
Security light!

491
00:41:08,049 --> 00:41:09,129
Oh, ah!

492
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,921
Thought I heard something.

493
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,224
That's quite
a nice bush, actually.

494
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,098
Goodnight, Jake.

495
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,265
What s... what the...

496
00:41:31,698 --> 00:41:33,063
It's rigged.

497
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,580
Let's get in there.

498
00:41:50,258 --> 00:41:52,044
Dogs probably.

499
00:41:52,135 --> 00:41:53,545
Sweet dreams then, Jake.

500
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:57,466
Right, right, right,
if you remove just one panel

501
00:41:57,557 --> 00:41:59,437
of glass, get to the door
handle, then we're in.

502
00:42:00,143 --> 00:42:02,179
Here, borrow
my gardening gloves.

503
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,303
Go on. Pink?

504
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,859
Okay.

505
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:23,658
All right.

506
00:42:32,133 --> 00:42:33,133
Right.

507
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,851
All right, I'm going
to smash my way in.

508
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,573
Oh, my god.

509
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:41,903
It's Mike Harris. What?

510
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,448
The speedway rider, look!

511
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,204
This must be his house.

512
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,247
Oh, my god.

513
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,451
I was at the euro
championships '94.

514
00:43:51,546 --> 00:43:54,441
He was three bikes back, then on the
last lap, he canes it up on the inside,

515
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:56,581
front wheel almost
doesn't touch the ground.

516
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:58,587
Boom, right on the line,
he takes from henshall.

517
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,926
It was just beautiful.

518
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,324
I bet that trophy is
here somewhere...

519
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:04,634
- Right, that's it.
- No, no, no, no, wait.

520
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,595
This is perfect.

521
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:09,810
Harris hasn't won for a while.

522
00:44:09,897 --> 00:44:12,183
All these new kids,
younger, faster,

523
00:44:12,275 --> 00:44:15,017
I bet he hasn't won
any prize money for yonks.

524
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:17,352
I hear his sponsor pulled out
and backed some other kid.

525
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:18,811
What are you talking about?

526
00:44:21,617 --> 00:44:25,656
No one knows who took
those diamonds.

527
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,576
If the police think he did,
and it makes perfect sense,

528
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,783
he would need another
source of income.

529
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,792
So... I'll make an anonymous
call to the police,

530
00:44:36,883 --> 00:44:40,421
tell them that I know for
a fact that Mike Harris has

531
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:44,424
the diamonds and he has them
right there in his very house.

532
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:48,133
They'll go there, find the
diamonds for us, the diamonds,

533
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,138
theyllend up in
the evidence room for what?

534
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,844
Two, three days
before they've done

535
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:53,659
the paperwork, and then
they'll return them.

536
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,851
How do you know that?

537
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,476
Because my mom works down
at that police station.

538
00:44:58,571 --> 00:44:59,771
Your mom works for the police?

539
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,647
As a cleaner.

540
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:06,155
She's cool and she's
very supportive.

541
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,912
And the other thing is, she
can get into that evidence room

542
00:45:09,999 --> 00:45:14,618
on her cleaning duties, which
happens to be tomorrow night.

543
00:45:14,712 --> 00:45:18,330
She can slip the diamonds back
to us, and from then on,

544
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,039
we're in the clear.

545
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:23,217
Meanwhile, Mike Harris
will be speeding

546
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:25,761
his way to a life behind bars.

547
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,006
What do you say, guys?

548
00:45:38,236 --> 00:45:39,976
I like it.

549
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,694
But on one condition.

550
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:47,492
If we try this
and it doesn't work,

551
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:53,072
it'll be the last thing
you ever do, ever.

552
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:57,087
Hmm?

553
00:45:58,631 --> 00:45:59,631
Yes, sir.

554
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:04,925
- Yeah.
- Goody, goody, gumdrops.

555
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,297
Let's do it.

556
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:18,605
- Jake.
- Thank you.

557
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,610
Sam.

558
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:24,691
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, daddy.

559
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,324
My pleasure.

560
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,455
Boys, have you been
messing around down here?

561
00:46:35,543 --> 00:46:37,579
There's a brick on
a piece of string.

562
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:42,218
- Do you think that...
- Who do you think it was?

563
00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:46,467
Negative, sir,

564
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,294
there's a car parked
in the drive.

565
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,970
Daddy. Yeah?

566
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,093
There's something
that we need to tell you.

567
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:55,301
Right.

568
00:46:55,396 --> 00:46:57,102
Um. =tell me in a minute.

569
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,949
I'll just go and get the door.

570
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,688
Do you think
it's about the diamonds? =no.

571
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:10,111
Can I help you?

572
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,863
Mr. Michael Harris?

573
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,115
Detective inspector
Peter Hector.

574
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,936
That's a lovely motor
you've got there.

575
00:47:18,002 --> 00:47:20,118
Bit of a diamond,
wouldn't you say?

576
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,577
If this is about
that number plate,

577
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,287
it never goes off
the end of that drive.

578
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,797
It's not about the number
plate, is it?

579
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,490
I - Mr. Michael Harris,

580
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,799
we are entering your premises

581
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:34,014
in accordance with section 32

582
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:36,638
of the police and criminal
evidence act 1984...

583
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,060
Wait, wait, what is this about?

584
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,731
- Just stay calm.
- I am calm,

585
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:44,809
- but this is ridiculous.
- Is it now?

586
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:49,279
It must be to do
with the diamonds.

587
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,982
Shall we tell them?

588
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:54,695
Where's the boys' mother?
She's back home in America.

589
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:55,789
Is she now?

590
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,115
=-wwho do you think...
What should we do?

591
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,825
Sir, I found them.

592
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,748
That's, that's not mine.

593
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,334
Precisely.

594
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:09,667
Mr. Michael Harris, I am
arresting you on suspicion

595
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,174
of the theft of half a million
pounds worth of diamonds...

596
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:14,801
- Boys, 1 didn't do anything.
- You do not need to say anything,

597
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,178
- but it may harm your...
- This is ridiculous.

598
00:48:17,269 --> 00:48:19,289
- I've done nothing wrong. Boys.
- You do not have to say anything,

599
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,916
- but it harm your defense...
- Ah, ah, ah.

600
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,147
When questioneaq,
something you later rely on...

601
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:35,864
- Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
- No!

602
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,307
- He didn't do anything.
- Calm down.

603
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,867
We found them. Calm down.

604
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,114
But, but... =he'll be fine.

605
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,665
We'll look after him, okay?

606
00:48:43,504 --> 00:48:45,482
Boys, I know this is
upsetting, but this is the law,

607
00:48:45,506 --> 00:48:47,588
and the law is there
to protect you and us.

608
00:48:47,675 --> 00:48:48,985
But, but he didn't do anything.

609
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,545
He didn't, we found... but...

610
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,797
Now, listen to me, your
mommy's going to be contacted,

611
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,004
but until she returns,
you need to come with us.

612
00:48:59,562 --> 00:49:02,554
It's a really nice
facility, boys,

613
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,889
with very caring professionals.

614
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:07,858
You'll be well looked after,
you just need to come with us.

615
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,529
But we need our teddies,
otherwise we'll be very sad.

616
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,622
Okay then, let's go
get the teddies.

617
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:41,475
Jake, run! - No, you
don't, come here. Come here, you two.

618
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,352
Oh, come on. Stop, stop.

619
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:49,016
Jake, out the window!

620
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:51,902
Where are they?

621
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,941
Oh. Oh, my god, the window.

622
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:58,817
I can't see them,
they must have jumped.

623
00:49:58,913 --> 00:50:00,353
We're going to have
to radio this in.

624
00:50:01,165 --> 00:50:04,032
Hey, stop, you two! Come here!

625
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,999
Stop!

626
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,299
Where do you think you're going?

627
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,046
Hey, hey, where are you going?

628
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:21,132
Hey, stop, stop!

629
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:30,225
Where did you...
Come back. Come here.

630
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,728
Boys, stop!

631
00:50:39,495 --> 00:50:41,736
They're getting away!

632
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,078
Hey, come on.

633
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:46,876
Hey, oi!

634
00:50:47,628 --> 00:50:48,959
Stop these boys!

635
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,302
I'll go and radio it in.

636
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,137
All units, we have
our suspect under arrest,

637
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,312
stolen diamonds in hand.

638
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:12,858
Two boys on the run.

639
00:51:12,945 --> 00:51:15,357
I repeat,
two children on the run.

640
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:24,161
Description, one blonde,
about, well...

641
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:27,243
Not very high, um.

642
00:51:31,297 --> 00:51:32,787
Don't touch me!

643
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,042
- Don't you touch me!
- Enjoy your stay with us.

644
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:38,251
We look forward to welcoming you again.

645
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:40,256
This way. =next!

646
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,463
Right, down the stairs, come on.

647
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:46,182
And who might you be?

648
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,682
Mike, Michael Harris.

649
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:52,139
Michael, lovely.

650
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,361
Occupation?

651
00:51:55,988 --> 00:51:57,444
Speedway rider.

652
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,522
Speedway rider.

653
00:52:00,993 --> 00:52:02,403
That's very good.

654
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,571
Speedway rider.

655
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,076
Speedway rider.

656
00:52:21,889 --> 00:52:23,675
Fabulous, reason for arrest?

657
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,800
Theft of half a million
pounds worth of diamonds.

658
00:52:27,895 --> 00:52:30,011
- Disgusting.
- I, I didn't.

659
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,563
Disgusting.

660
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,669
Is this some kind of joke?

661
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:35,693
Joke?

662
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,485
We take crime very seriously.

663
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:41,988
Very seriously, indeed.

664
00:52:43,744 --> 00:52:49,330
I've spent 23 years with
criminal after criminal,

665
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:55,036
and I don't know
how much more... I can take.

666
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,712
Look, my kids are out there,
god only knows where,

667
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,631
and no one's doing
a thing about it.

668
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:07,590
Well, no disrespect, but maybe
a little less grand theft

669
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:12,474
and you might be at home
playing pass the parcel

670
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:13,804
and eating ice cream.

671
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,358
Cell number seven.

672
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,737
Enjoy your stay.

673
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,778
We look forward to working
with you again.

674
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,465
This is all our fault.

675
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,840
We can make it right.

676
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:46,966
Should we call mommy?

677
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,547
We just got daddy arrested.

678
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,553
Calling mommy is not an option.

679
00:53:58,694 --> 00:54:00,650
We have to get daady out.

680
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,353
Plus it's his race on Saturday.

681
00:54:02,448 --> 00:54:04,609
He'll never forgive us
if he misses that.

682
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:17,459
I'm hungry.

683
00:54:19,465 --> 00:54:22,332
Look at all this,
this is energy food.

684
00:54:22,426 --> 00:54:24,792
Do you know how many trees
you can climb on one of these?

685
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:30,305
When I'm gone, I do not want
you boys just sat staring

686
00:54:30,392 --> 00:54:32,553
into those screens for
the rest of your life.

687
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:34,638
Come on, I've got a plan.

688
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:40,023
Come on.

689
00:56:33,557 --> 00:56:35,843
L

690
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:19,557
Oi, you two, come back here!

691
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:23,603
Here! Hey!

692
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:39,413
All units.

693
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:44,200
All units, all units
to Glen close.

694
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,832
Glen close, that's brilliant.

695
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:57,926
I'm being serious, those two
little boys have escaped again.

696
00:57:59,351 --> 00:58:02,058
Yeah, all, all units,
all units up meryl street.

697
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:05,186
Those kids again.

698
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:30,087
- Hey, Lucy, how are you?
- Michael, I've been worried.

699
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,710
- I've been calling Ana calling.
- Yeah, sorry about that.

700
00:58:32,801 --> 00:58:36,464
The boys and I have just
been playing and playing.

701
00:58:36,555 --> 00:58:37,555
You know how it is.

702
00:58:38,557 --> 00:58:42,175
Okay... would you put them on?

703
00:58:43,854 --> 00:58:44,889
I'd like to talk to them.

704
00:58:44,980 --> 00:58:47,687
Uh, yeah, of course, of course.

705
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:49,981
Hey, boys, do you want
to take a break

706
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:52,434
from the tennis
and talk to your mommy?

707
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:57,010
- Really sorry.
- Really sorry.

708
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:58,820
We'll pay you back, we promise.

709
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,138
- We promise.
- We'll pay you back.

710
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,948
- Sorry, so sorry.
- Come back, come back!

711
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,154
No?

712
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:04,832
Really?

713
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,785
Hey, Sam, be nice to
Jake, all right?

714
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,915
None of that stuff.

715
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,674
Cheeky boys, you know
how they are, right?

716
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:21,755
Okay, as long
as everything's fine.

717
00:59:26,438 --> 00:59:28,099
Is everything fine, Michael?

718
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:30,267
Fine.

719
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:31,358
Everything is great.

720
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:34,977
It's all under control.

721
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:36,822
Okay.

722
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:40,236
See you soon, right?

723
01:00:42,389 --> 01:00:44,050
Well, if you really
didn't do this,

724
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,678
yet the diamonds were
found in your house.

725
01:00:47,686 --> 01:00:51,850
You have to consider that
the real thieves are your boys.

726
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,642
No, no way.

727
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,519
In my line of work, we normally
find when people run,

728
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,023
they're guilty of something.

729
01:01:00,115 --> 01:01:01,446
My boys are good boys.

730
01:01:01,533 --> 01:01:03,524
They would never do
something like that.

731
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,284
Let me show you something.

732
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:29,224
So, your boys would never
do something like that, eh?

733
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,968
Quite terrified, the poor lady.

734
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:37,399
Probably a small mercy
we don't have the sound.

735
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,973
Come on, come on.

736
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,069
PC 383 Jackson.

737
01:02:33,124 --> 01:02:35,115
Uh, I'm sorry?

738
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,210
Who is this?

739
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:41,209
Lucy Harris,
who the hell are you?

740
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:43,290
I'm the policeman
guarding your house

741
01:02:43,385 --> 01:02:47,048
while your husband's in jail and
your kids are on the run, miss.

742
01:02:52,394 --> 01:02:53,429
What?

743
01:03:02,487 --> 01:03:04,478
- Hello?
- It's Lucy Harris.

744
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:06,984
Get my husband on
the phone, please.

745
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:08,235
Do not put me on hold.

746
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:11,681
- Well, just what...
- / am not waiting...

747
01:03:11,705 --> 01:03:13,161
- No, no, no.
- Any longer.

748
01:03:13,248 --> 01:03:15,455
Just give him the phone.

749
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:16,542
All right.

750
01:03:19,379 --> 01:03:20,744
There's a call for you.

751
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:22,170
=-no. - Now, officially,

752
01:03:22,257 --> 01:03:24,464
youre not meant to
have any more calls,

753
01:03:24,551 --> 01:03:26,587
- but this lady here...
- No, no, no, no.

754
01:03:26,678 --> 01:03:29,511
She"s phoned about 57 times,
and she's not going to

755
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:32,634
- let it go, so, uh.
- No, just tell her

756
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,682
- I'm not in.
- Oh.

757
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:39,934
I'm just handing the phone
to your husband, madam,

758
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:41,435
in his cell.

759
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:50,941
Lucy. Michael.

760
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,111
What is going on? =just...

761
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:56,446
I leave you for a week
and this is what happens?

762
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:58,907
Stolen diamonds,
boys on the run?

763
01:03:59,002 --> 01:04:02,335
- You... where are they, Michael?
- Just let me explain.

764
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:04,162
! Knew you were irresponsible,

765
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,622
but this is off the scale...

766
01:04:05,717 --> 01:04:07,253
- Ma'am.
- Just...

767
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,592
I am on the next flight.

768
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:12,341
Listen... just let me explain.

769
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:15,215
I'm sorry.

770
01:07:04,187 --> 01:07:06,348
Well, I don't know
if it was that weird dream

771
01:07:06,439 --> 01:07:11,103
or the church, but I remember
something someone once said.

772
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:14,777
"If you are lost and
you don't know what to do...

773
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:18,068
You should retrace your steps.”

774
01:07:19,661 --> 01:07:21,021
So, that is what
we're going to do.

775
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:33,504
Stop, wait!

776
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:58,362
This must be where
they were watching us from.

777
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:09,915
- This looks like a bomb.
- Jake, just put it down.

778
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:53,118
Suddenly, those years of lip
reading practice came in handy.

779
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:57,542
Even with my lip reading skills,
this was a tough one.

780
01:08:58,635 --> 01:09:01,092
F couldn't be sure,
but he said something

781
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,460
about the police station.

782
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:06,631
And a cleaner mom, very odd.

783
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,017
Irnat was not the owner
of the shop.

784
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:11,969
Rnose criminals have done
something with him.

785
01:09:12,065 --> 01:09:13,646
Boo!

786
01:09:13,733 --> 01:09:15,252
I can only imagine

787
01:09:15,276 --> 01:09:16,812
how terrible.

788
01:09:16,903 --> 01:09:18,518
If we're ever going

789
01:09:18,613 --> 01:09:19,978
to get daddy out, it was time

790
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:21,813
to do something
a bit more drastic.

791
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:00,693
! Knew I'd seen
that face before.

792
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:05,694
Now this cleaner mom thing
is starting to make sense.

793
01:10:05,785 --> 01:10:07,241
Is she in on this?

794
01:10:30,768 --> 01:10:33,180
Do you mind?

795
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,724
You are meant to be
a cleaner, not a masseuse.

796
01:10:35,815 --> 01:10:38,181
Well, I've cleaned
everything else.

797
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:41,438
Everything except
the evidence room.

798
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:45,188
I could go down and do that.

799
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:46,318
I just need the key.

800
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:50,951
We don't clean
the evidence room.

801
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,122
No one ever cleans
the evidence room.

802
01:10:55,209 --> 01:10:58,326
The evidence room is
a dank and dirty place

803
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:01,913
full of unspeakable things
from unspeakable crimes.

804
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,800
Well, I'll just stay
here then. Carry on.

805
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:08,924
I've got two hours
of my shift left.

806
01:11:09,015 --> 01:11:11,427
We'll soon have you
spick and span.

807
01:11:18,691 --> 01:11:20,181
Bon appetit.

808
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:21,641
Merci, senor.

809
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:28,653
I warn you, the smell
down there is so pungent

810
01:11:28,743 --> 01:11:31,906
that you and your little
pompom friend

811
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,324
won't be down there very long.

812
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,656
I don't know what's wrong
with that officer Pierce.

813
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:19,991
Perhaps he needs to get
himself a girlfriend.

814
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:21,451
Would you do?

815
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:23,628
- Or a boyfriend.
- I yeah, move over.

816
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:26,797
I mean, and that
one in cell 12, for goodness sake,

817
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:28,465
he is really...

818
01:12:31,097 --> 01:12:32,132
I got the keys, son.

819
01:12:33,474 --> 01:12:37,058
Wait out the back and I'll have
those gems to you in no time.

820
01:12:39,105 --> 01:12:40,220
All right, mom.

821
01:12:41,148 --> 01:12:42,148
Yeah.

822
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:45,694
Bye.

823
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,230
What was that?

824
01:14:15,409 --> 01:14:16,774
What the blazes?

825
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,285
What have you done
to this poor woman?

826
01:14:20,373 --> 01:14:22,614
- Arrest them!
- Jake, run!

827
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:24,744
Stop, come here,
boys. Come here.

828
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:27,793
Come here then.

829
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:29,461
Stop, you little.

830
01:14:30,174 --> 01:14:31,630
Stop, come here, you two!

831
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:34,094
Stop!

832
01:14:52,571 --> 01:14:54,357
Oh, my god.

833
01:14:55,783 --> 01:14:57,023
Stop.

834
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,117
Stop, hmm?

835
01:15:04,208 --> 01:15:06,199
Just...

836
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,579
Hang on. Just stop, all right?

837
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,457
You don't know
what's going on, do you?

838
01:15:10,548 --> 01:15:13,130
The cleaner's son is outside
at the back door right now

839
01:15:13,217 --> 01:15:14,377
waiting for the diamonds!

840
01:15:15,553 --> 01:15:17,919
That is ridiculous.

841
01:15:19,557 --> 01:15:21,047
What the, what?

842
01:15:23,728 --> 01:15:26,765
This man, I know where he is,
I can get him for you,

843
01:15:26,856 --> 01:15:28,266
if you give me my dad back.

844
01:15:31,318 --> 01:15:33,183
Well, if you can prove
he's the real thief,

845
01:15:33,279 --> 01:15:34,394
your dad goes free.

846
01:15:50,713 --> 01:15:51,953
Hello, boys.

847
01:15:52,965 --> 01:15:54,705
May I help you?

848
01:15:54,800 --> 01:15:57,416
Your boys have failed
to get the diamonds.

849
01:15:57,511 --> 01:16:00,344
You need us, we're ready
to make a deal.

850
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,843
A deal?

851
01:16:06,103 --> 01:16:09,641
I stole those diamonds, hmm?

852
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:10,847
But okay.

853
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:13,854
It's my deal, huh?

854
01:16:13,944 --> 01:16:18,153
Give me the diamonds
or I'll snap his neck like a...

855
01:16:19,158 --> 01:16:22,275
How do you say, uh,
a lolly stick.

856
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:23,734
That's my brother!

857
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:25,740
Then you'd better be quick

858
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,322
or I'll snap both your necks.

859
01:16:29,752 --> 01:16:31,552
Violence is almost
never the answer,

860
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:33,953
unless we're talking
about an absolute bully.

861
01:16:36,926 --> 01:16:38,757
You're a bully, aren't you?

862
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:43,633
I'm only just getting started.

863
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,841
Right there,
straight on the nose

864
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,052
with everything you've got.

865
01:16:58,489 --> 01:17:00,195
You want to punch really hard?

866
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:02,610
Punch through the bag.

867
01:17:19,552 --> 01:17:21,508
Wait a second,
let's rewind a bit.

868
01:17:25,391 --> 01:17:29,054
Detective Hector did check out
my story, and guess what?

869
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:32,561
They got those guys.

870
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,752
But then I did have to deal
with a little bit of technology,

871
01:17:39,905 --> 01:17:41,190
but for the right reasons.

872
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,282
A deal?

873
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:48,490
I stole those diamonds, hmm?

874
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:56,619
/t turns out the police
don't much like bullies either.

875
01:18:01,177 --> 01:18:03,213
I stole those diamonds.

876
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:05,719
All in all, I think
it was a pretty good

877
01:18:05,806 --> 01:18:07,967
day's work for detective Hector.

878
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,641
But there was still one
pretty major thing left to do.

879
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,895
And we really have to do it
before mommy gets back.

880
01:18:26,368 --> 01:18:28,404
Boys, god, I've missed you.

881
01:18:29,914 --> 01:18:31,074
I missed you, boys.

882
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,489
I missed you so much.

883
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:34,790
I really have.

884
01:18:37,463 --> 01:18:38,873
Just a little paperwork.

885
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,764
Three to four hours
and you'll be out of here.

886
01:18:41,759 --> 01:18:44,000
You'll be in time
for your race, daddy.

887
01:18:44,803 --> 01:18:47,089
No, boys, I don't care
about any of that now.

888
01:18:47,181 --> 01:18:49,843
The fact is you're safe, and
that's all that matters to me.

889
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:53,051
You have to, it's who you are.

890
01:18:53,145 --> 01:18:54,635
It's what you love.

891
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:56,888
And Jake was right.

892
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:02,810
But my race is in 30 minutes.

893
01:19:09,161 --> 01:19:10,446
Put these on.

894
01:19:10,537 --> 01:19:12,698
You can do it, daddy. Come on.

895
01:19:13,374 --> 01:19:15,365
It was like watching
daddy come alive again.

896
01:19:17,253 --> 01:19:19,369
Don't forget
to Polish that chrome.

897
01:19:19,463 --> 01:19:20,748
I want to shine when I win.

898
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:22,465
Sure.

899
01:20:01,755 --> 01:20:04,167
Your radio, get me
the officer in charge.

900
01:20:05,426 --> 01:20:06,426
Now.

901
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:10,676
Sarge.

902
01:20:13,309 --> 01:20:15,425
=hi. - Mrs. Harris,

903
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:18,101
- detective Hector here.
- What is going on here?

904
01:20:18,188 --> 01:20:21,897
We have your husband and
your boys, everyone is safe.

905
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,100
It was a wrongful arrest,
I'm afraid.

906
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:26,731
We're escorting them
right now to the race track.

907
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:30,731
You're taking them where?

908
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:35,448
His race, we should just
about make it in time.

909
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,655
Are you insane?

910
01:20:37,750 --> 01:20:39,240
No!

911
01:20:39,335 --> 01:20:40,335
Mrs. Harris.

912
01:20:42,004 --> 01:20:44,586
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

913
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:46,667
Here.

914
01:20:48,927 --> 01:20:52,169
I'll, uh, just use your loo, and
then I'll be on my way, miss.

915
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,426
Unbelievable.

916
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:14,737
I'm going to be speeding,
by the way.

917
01:21:24,004 --> 01:21:26,211
- Good luck, daddy.
- Thank you.

918
01:21:26,965 --> 01:21:28,375
- Good luck, daddy.
- Thank you.

919
01:21:28,467 --> 01:21:29,867
- Go fast.
- See you from the stand.

920
01:21:53,242 --> 01:21:54,682
How long do I have?

921
01:21:59,289 --> 01:22:02,452
The riders
are lining up for the finals.

922
01:22:18,642 --> 01:22:21,805
And they're off!

923
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,175
A great start from Chris Warren,

924
01:22:23,230 --> 01:22:24,720
but local champ, Kevin Jenkins,

925
01:22:24,815 --> 01:22:26,180
is having none of that.

926
01:22:29,027 --> 01:22:32,565
Jenkins leads, but Mike
Harris is catching up.

927
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,280
And he's chasing his tail.

928
01:22:44,877 --> 01:22:47,789
Jenkins leads.
Harris is catching up.

929
01:22:47,880 --> 01:22:49,711
He's really giving
his all today.

930
01:22:49,798 --> 01:22:52,835
Watching as Mike Harris
overtakes into the turn.

931
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:54,507
Unbelievable!

932
01:22:54,595 --> 01:22:56,551
Oh, Harris is down!

933
01:22:56,638 --> 01:22:57,548
Mike Harris 1s down.

934
01:22:57,639 --> 01:22:59,049
Red flag.

935
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:01,132
Harris is down.

936
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,342
This looks like a bad one.

937
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:05,268
He's not moving.

938
01:23:05,355 --> 01:23:06,936
The helmet's off.

939
01:23:07,024 --> 01:23:08,605
Medics, medics.

940
01:23:13,572 --> 01:23:15,153
Ladies and gentiemen,
he's moving.

941
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,531
Well, that'll be it
for Mike Harris.

942
01:23:18,619 --> 01:23:21,452
Mike Harris will be
surely leaving the race,

943
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,948
ladies and gentiemen.

944
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,231
Don't worry, he'll be okay.

945
01:23:51,318 --> 01:23:54,902
And that's it,
Mike Harris is out.

946
01:23:55,906 --> 01:23:57,612
No, wait, please.

947
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,405
Just, my boys are watching.

948
01:24:00,827 --> 01:24:02,317
If they see me walk
away like this,

949
01:24:02,412 --> 01:24:03,652
what does that teach them?

950
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:06,412
I want them to know
anything is possible.

951
01:24:07,084 --> 01:24:09,200
You're a father,
you understand that, right?

952
01:24:10,087 --> 01:24:11,918
Please just let me finish this.

953
01:24:12,005 --> 01:24:15,372
Just let me race
and I promise you,

954
01:24:16,677 --> 01:24:17,712
I'll never race again.

955
01:24:21,265 --> 01:24:22,675
Wait.

956
01:24:22,766 --> 01:24:24,347
- Ihank you.
- Incredibly,

957
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,516
the Marshall has overruled.

958
01:24:26,603 --> 01:24:29,561
Mike Harris is allowed
one more race.

959
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:33,732
Riders, you have two minutes.

960
01:24:39,866 --> 01:24:41,553
Mommy and daddy
haven't looked at each other

961
01:24:41,577 --> 01:24:43,238
like this since
we've been alive.

962
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:52,706
It's something called
support... and appreciation.

963
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,792
And we should all do it more.

964
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:01,714
- What else am I good at?
- It's so dangerous.

965
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,199
Go and do something important.

966
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:04,508
Why didn't you do anything?

967
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:06,056
It's a young man's game.

968
01:25:06,143 --> 01:25:07,883
You have to, it's who you are.

969
01:25:07,978 --> 01:25:10,206
- When I'm gone...
- It's what you love.

970
01:25:10,230 --> 01:25:12,721
I do not want you boys sat
staring into those devices for

971
01:25:12,816 --> 01:25:14,101
the rest of your life.

972
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:16,774
Riders are lined up.

973
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:19,437
Counting down.

974
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:28,153
And they're off. An incredible start
for Harris. He's flying, folks.

975
01:25:28,248 --> 01:25:30,864
Phenomenal turn, I've never
seen anything like it.

976
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:32,244
Jenkins battered with dirt.

977
01:25:32,336 --> 01:25:33,826
Harris powering forward.

978
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:36,878
This is like the euro
championship of '94.

979
01:25:39,343 --> 01:25:42,050
Jenkins gives it all,
it's nowhere near enough.

980
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:47,681
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mike Harris wins.

981
01:25:48,435 --> 01:25:51,472
Vwhat a celebration this will be.

982
01:26:08,246 --> 01:26:10,362
Those TV people
asked Kevin Jenkins

983
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:14,450
what it was like to be a loser
and he declined to comment.

984
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:21,502
We all make mistakes,
it's a part of life.

985
01:26:21,593 --> 01:26:23,629
But when we do,
it's how we fix them.

986
01:26:25,263 --> 01:26:27,595
- Keep the change!
- Sorry again!

987
01:26:27,683 --> 01:26:28,718
Bye.

988
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:41,105
Come on, let's get back
to our cell.

989
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,941
What goes around comes around.

990
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:49,901
Sometimes we have to accept
that things are unfair,

991
01:26:49,996 --> 01:26:51,577
but maybe there's a reason.

992
01:26:58,672 --> 01:27:00,378
Now daddy does drive
that old car,

993
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,171
but only for special occasions.

994
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:05,217
Ah, Mr. Harris, I presume?

995
01:27:07,097 --> 01:27:08,837
And you must be
the two young lads.

996
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:14,802
Master Jake and master Samuel,
come this way.

997
01:27:14,896 --> 01:27:16,352
And what could be more special

998
01:27:16,440 --> 01:27:19,147
than visiting england's
largest castle?

999
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:22,601
Lady hurst
is expecting you, sir.

1000
01:27:22,696 --> 01:27:23,856
Thank you.

1001
01:27:34,708 --> 01:27:37,074
May I present, lady hurst.

1002
01:27:37,169 --> 01:27:39,455
Master Jake and master Samuel.

1003
01:27:42,382 --> 01:27:46,796
You have both shown incredible
bravery and courage,

1004
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:48,502
and that must be rewarded.

1005
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,602
I'm sure I saw
a tear in daddy's eye,

1006
01:28:02,527 --> 01:28:04,108
but of course he denies it.

1007
01:28:07,574 --> 01:28:09,110
I suppose you're wondering
what is in

1008
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:10,907
those little posh pouches.

1009
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,484
Well, here's a little clue.

1010
01:28:14,873 --> 01:28:16,454
And did I get my dream girl?

1011
01:28:17,167 --> 01:28:19,032
Well, I'll leave that
to your imagination.

1012
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:28,255
J locked in time with
no space to breathe j

1021

our devices and get out there.

1022
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:04,953
Adventure awaits.

1023
01:29:05,048 --> 01:29:06,288
Thanks for watching.

01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:14,509

Everybody quiet on set.

1037
01:29:57,559 --> 01:29:59,559
Get ready, everyone else
walking in the background.

1038
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,969
And Rory, on action. Look
caught out and say the line.

1039
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:03,394
And three, two, one, action.

1040
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,305
Observe, look back.

1041
01:30:05,984 --> 01:30:08,566
Sorry.

1042
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:09,813
Action.

1043
01:30:11,197 --> 01:30:12,812
And coming through.

1044
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:16,696
J is this what my soul's
been dreaming of? J;

1045
01:30:16,786 --> 01:30:18,902

J feeling the earth
beneath our feet j

1047
01:30:24,461 --> 01:30:26,918
quick, Rory,
quick, quick, quick!

1048
01:30:27,005 --> 01:30:28,791
Oh, cut, he's, he's fallen off.

1049
01:30:31,134 --> 01:30:34,592
I'm Lisa Harris. No,
I'm not, I'm Lucy Harris.

1050
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:36,840
I'm sorry. Okay,

1054
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,957
- Read the whole thing again.

1055
01:30:44,981 --> 01:30:46,096
There you go.

1056
01:30:48,151 --> 01:30:49,151

background, look at each other.

found the lot, you're intrigued.

Rory, climb in there.

1060

finish this, let me race.

I promise you...
I'll never race again.

01:31:16,304 --> 01:31:18,215
And then nod your head.
