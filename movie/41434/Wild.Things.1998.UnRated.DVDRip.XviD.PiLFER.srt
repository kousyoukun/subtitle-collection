1
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,726
Forget it, loser.

2
00:03:55,185 --> 00:03:57,146
Oh, Mr. Lombardo.

3
00:03:57,396 --> 00:03:59,022
- Hey.
- Hey, bro.

4
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:01,525
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

5
00:04:02,192 --> 00:04:04,486
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

6
00:04:04,653 --> 00:04:06,446
Jennifer...

7
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:20,085
Did you see his eyes?

8
00:04:37,436 --> 00:04:39,313
What are you looking at, dork?

9
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,108
Fuck off.

10
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,861
I appreciate you guys coming down.

11
00:04:47,446 --> 00:04:50,199
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in this dump is...

12
00:04:51,784 --> 00:04:53,160
Settle down.

13
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:55,746
Settle down.

14
00:04:56,246 --> 00:05:01,376
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

15
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,381
Settle down.
Settle down.

16
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:09,802
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!

17
00:05:10,135 --> 00:05:14,890
- That you, Jimmy?
- At least in study hall I can meditate.

18
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,226
What he means is, "masturbate."

19
00:05:17,893 --> 00:05:22,064
Something with which I'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.

20
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:50,425
It wasn't me, man.
It wasn't me.

21
00:05:51,301 --> 00:05:52,678
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.

22
00:05:52,845 --> 00:05:57,808
We've all heard the terms
"date rape," "sexual harassment."

23
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,563
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.

24
00:06:03,313 --> 00:06:07,109
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

25
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:11,238
Detectives Duquette and Perez...

26
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,282
...are here to give us
what we hope...

27
00:06:13,448 --> 00:06:15,826
...will be a fresh perspective
on the subject...

28
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:19,455
...and to address any questions
that any of you might have.

29
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:22,166
Now, let's give them
a warm welcome.

30
00:06:25,627 --> 00:06:27,171
- Thank you.
- I'm out of here.

31
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:31,008
- Why don't we begin with a question.
- This prick can kiss my ass.

32
00:06:40,017 --> 00:06:41,810
As I was saying...

33
00:06:42,019 --> 00:06:44,605
...why don't we begin
with a question.

34
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:48,817
- What is a sex crime?
- Not getting any.

35
00:06:57,242 --> 00:06:59,620
What's with that?
She's the one who walked out.

36
00:07:00,078 --> 00:07:03,540
- Suzie Toller.
- I busted her last year for possession.

37
00:07:03,707 --> 00:07:05,709
Poor kid did six months
in Camp Nine.

38
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:08,921
- Six months? First offense?
- I didn't hand down the sentence.

39
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:10,798
She was dirty.
I busted her.

40
00:07:10,964 --> 00:07:12,174
Hey, Carol.

41
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,676
I appreciate you guys
taking the time to come.

42
00:07:14,843 --> 00:07:16,053
Our pleasure.

43
00:07:21,517 --> 00:07:24,686
Why do I get the feeling you don't
like the guidance counselor?

44
00:07:24,853 --> 00:07:28,273
Don't tell me you can't see through
his routine. He's a total hound.

45
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,526
You mean pussy hound?

46
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,906
Actually, I thought
he was kind of cute.

47
00:07:36,156 --> 00:07:37,658
I'd do him.

48
00:08:07,604 --> 00:08:09,356
Steady.

49
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,321
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

50
00:08:18,448 --> 00:08:19,700
That's good.

51
00:08:27,374 --> 00:08:29,168
Drop the main.

52
00:08:29,793 --> 00:08:33,589
All right, guys, let's de-rig
and I'll see you all Monday.

53
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,891
Hey, ladies, my car needs a wash.

54
00:08:44,224 --> 00:08:45,642
Do you do windows?

55
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:48,604
Good work, guys.
A.C., see you Monday.

56
00:08:48,812 --> 00:08:51,064
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.
- All right, buddy.

57
00:09:02,367 --> 00:09:03,827
All right.

58
00:09:03,994 --> 00:09:06,079
I could definitely party
on one of those.

59
00:09:09,124 --> 00:09:11,001
It's a stinkpot, Jimmy.

60
00:09:11,168 --> 00:09:15,255
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.

61
00:09:17,257 --> 00:09:18,926
Yeah.

62
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:21,011
That's a real boat.

63
00:09:22,805 --> 00:09:24,973
Thank you for getting me
into this class.

64
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,768
No way my old man was gonna
spring for the fees.

65
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:31,980
Hey, you're working for it, and you're
learning your way around a boat.

66
00:09:32,147 --> 00:09:34,441
I put myself through college
working on boats.

67
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,693
- Beats flipping burgers.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:37,986 --> 00:09:41,824
Can I play too, or is it just for boys?

69
00:09:44,576 --> 00:09:47,538
So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?

70
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:51,834
The senior car wash, remember?

71
00:09:52,209 --> 00:09:54,670
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.

72
00:09:54,878 --> 00:09:57,297
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and I do it?

73
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,258
We're working as a team.

74
00:09:59,424 --> 00:10:02,845
I tell you what. I'm going out
to the glades Saturday.

75
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:05,973
Why don't you come over Sunday
and wash all the mud off.

76
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,724
Deal.

77
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:11,687
I was counting on my mom
to give me a ride, but she's not here.

78
00:10:11,854 --> 00:10:13,313
Surprise, surprise.

79
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,233
So I was wondering
if you could give me one.

80
00:10:18,068 --> 00:10:21,321
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?

81
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,907
I mean, like,
something bad might happen.

82
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,080
- What about you, you need a lift?
- Yeah, but I got my bike.

83
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:32,207
Hey, no problem.

84
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,637
Okay, try it.

85
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:53,937
Suzie, you need a lift?
We got room for one more.

86
00:10:54,104 --> 00:10:58,108
Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes,
"Whores 4 Less"?

87
00:11:00,986 --> 00:11:02,821
Try it again.

88
00:11:08,452 --> 00:11:11,121
Nice to see you kids getting along.

89
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,500
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.

90
00:11:59,503 --> 00:12:02,673
- Is that Sam Lombardo?
- Hi, Mom.

91
00:12:03,006 --> 00:12:04,800
Sam, hi.

92
00:12:05,259 --> 00:12:07,427
Hi, Sandra.

93
00:12:09,012 --> 00:12:12,933
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.

94
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,601
Sorry, Sandra, I gotta run.

95
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,763
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

96
00:13:33,972 --> 00:13:35,933
Hi, girls.

97
00:13:36,391 --> 00:13:38,268
Look. He forgot.

98
00:13:38,435 --> 00:13:40,604
- I knew it.
- No, I didn't.

99
00:13:40,771 --> 00:13:43,774
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.

100
00:13:44,107 --> 00:13:46,902
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.

101
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:50,239
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?

102
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:54,743
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

103
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,495
Sam, I'm leaving.

104
00:13:56,662 --> 00:13:59,248
So where's your hose,
Mr. Lombardo?

105
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:04,294
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.

106
00:14:09,174 --> 00:14:11,969
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?

107
00:14:12,886 --> 00:14:14,888
Come on, Barbara.
It's for a good cause.

108
00:14:17,933 --> 00:14:19,768
Sam the philanthropist.

109
00:14:19,935 --> 00:14:23,605
Yeah, well, you know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.

110
00:14:23,814 --> 00:14:25,524
Okay.

111
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:30,112
- Have fun at the club.
- Okay.

112
00:15:30,756 --> 00:15:32,299
Wow.

113
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,385
Looks brand-new.

114
00:15:38,222 --> 00:15:40,224
Aren't you forgetting something?

115
00:15:41,099 --> 00:15:43,852
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.

116
00:15:44,019 --> 00:15:45,813
Oh, yeah, that thing.

117
00:15:46,188 --> 00:15:50,025
- Can't we just...?
- Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

118
00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:52,486
Okay, let me look for it.

119
00:15:52,653 --> 00:15:55,906
Mr. Lombardo,
we're running kind of late.

120
00:15:56,198 --> 00:15:58,367
How about if Nicole goes on
to the Mansons'?

121
00:15:58,534 --> 00:16:00,410
You can give me a ride
when you find it.

122
00:16:00,702 --> 00:16:04,915
No, no, just give me a minute. Okay?

123
00:16:10,671 --> 00:16:13,715
- Go.
- Are you sure?

124
00:17:27,331 --> 00:17:29,458
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, God.

125
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:33,837
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

126
00:17:34,838 --> 00:17:37,299
Goddamn it!

127
00:17:38,634 --> 00:17:40,886
- Hello, this is Blue Bay High School.
- Hello.

128
00:17:41,053 --> 00:17:43,388
Your son or daughter
was absent today, Monday...

129
00:17:43,555 --> 00:17:45,641
Jesus H. Christ!

130
00:17:47,142 --> 00:17:49,603
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

131
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:50,979
Come on.

132
00:17:53,816 --> 00:17:57,277
- Art, this is a hell of a fish you caught.
- It's a barracuda.

133
00:17:57,694 --> 00:18:00,072
If you weren't so busy
chasing booty...

134
00:18:00,239 --> 00:18:03,325
...you'd have come with me
and caught one for yourself.

135
00:18:03,534 --> 00:18:05,911
Don't tell me you're gonna
eat this thing.

136
00:18:06,078 --> 00:18:07,329
Why not?

137
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:10,124
It's a barracuda. It's poisonous.
It'll kill you.

138
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:13,836
Shit, man, I could say that
about most of the girls you date.

139
00:18:14,002 --> 00:18:16,130
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

140
00:18:24,138 --> 00:18:26,807
- Sandra, what's up?
- Kelly skipped school today, Sam.

141
00:18:27,975 --> 00:18:29,518
Have you heard anything?

142
00:18:29,935 --> 00:18:31,186
Not a word.

143
00:18:32,354 --> 00:18:34,356
Never mind.

144
00:18:34,731 --> 00:18:36,984
I found her.

145
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,530
Pull!

146
00:18:41,989 --> 00:18:45,868
Listen, Sam, it was really good
seeing you the other day.

147
00:18:46,452 --> 00:18:48,412
Sandra, I'm real busy right now, so...

148
00:18:49,621 --> 00:18:53,500
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

149
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:58,380
- Yeah, well...
- I know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.

150
00:18:58,755 --> 00:19:03,302
- So what?
- So maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

151
00:19:04,344 --> 00:19:07,014
Aw, poor Sam.

152
00:19:07,181 --> 00:19:10,517
Really think you'll get one of these
Blue Bay women to marry you?

153
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,979
- Are you finished, Sandra?
- Grab a clue, honey.

154
00:19:14,146 --> 00:19:17,316
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.

155
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,735
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

156
00:19:19,943 --> 00:19:21,862
Goodbye, Sandra.

157
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,240
Pull!

158
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:30,871
You seem to find guns therapeutic.

159
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:34,124
Maybe I ought to try it.

160
00:19:36,293 --> 00:19:37,753
So let me guess.

161
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,756
Some boy didn't call and screwed up
your whole weekend.

162
00:19:40,923 --> 00:19:44,092
So you're taking the day off. Right?

163
00:19:47,638 --> 00:19:49,932
Which one of your deck hands
is that?

164
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:52,351
Whichever one I want.

165
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:58,524
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

166
00:20:01,985 --> 00:20:03,487
What is it?

167
00:20:04,988 --> 00:20:06,990
I miss Dad.

168
00:20:07,783 --> 00:20:09,576
Jesus.

169
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:14,790
I miss him too, sometimes.

170
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,291
No, you don't.

171
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,128
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

172
00:20:21,463 --> 00:20:23,382
Oh, Kelly...

173
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:33,559
I don't know why he did it.

174
00:20:36,562 --> 00:20:38,647
I really don't.

175
00:20:43,735 --> 00:20:45,362
Can l...?

176
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,826
Can I get you anything?

177
00:20:51,535 --> 00:20:53,120
Do you want a Valium?

178
00:20:57,249 --> 00:20:59,585
I was raped.

179
00:21:00,878 --> 00:21:05,215
- What, honey? I can't hear you.
- I said, I was raped.

180
00:21:05,382 --> 00:21:07,092
What?

181
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,389
I was raped...

182
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:16,226
...by Sam Lombardo.

183
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:20,147
Sam Lombardo?

184
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:25,194
My daughter does not
get raped in Blue Bay!

185
00:21:25,486 --> 00:21:27,988
And you're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?

186
00:21:28,197 --> 00:21:32,034
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

187
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,579
We understand your feelings,
Miss Van Ryan...

188
00:21:35,746 --> 00:21:38,832
...but please,
we need some time with Kelly.

189
00:21:39,082 --> 00:21:41,168
We'd like to take her statement alone.

190
00:21:45,339 --> 00:21:47,841
- Are you all right with this, baby?
- Yeah.

191
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:49,510
Okay.

192
00:21:59,728 --> 00:22:02,272
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

193
00:22:03,607 --> 00:22:05,108
I just wanna get it over with.

194
00:22:06,985 --> 00:22:09,029
We'd like to videotape this statement.

195
00:22:09,196 --> 00:22:12,616
I know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...

196
00:22:12,783 --> 00:22:17,329
...and we need to know everything that
happened between the two of you.

197
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:19,289
Are you ready?

198
00:22:29,007 --> 00:22:32,052
He started rubbing my shoulders.

199
00:22:34,763 --> 00:22:36,181
I let him.

200
00:22:36,348 --> 00:22:38,892
I mean, he's a nice guy.

201
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:42,271
The next thing...

202
00:22:43,063 --> 00:22:46,358
...his hand was in my shorts.

203
00:22:47,693 --> 00:22:49,653
You know, from behind.

204
00:22:51,822 --> 00:22:54,783
His fingers...

205
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,913
- His fingers...
- Take your time.

206
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:05,586
They were in me.

207
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,629
Both places, you know?

208
00:23:09,673 --> 00:23:12,301
Did he put himself inside you?

209
00:23:13,427 --> 00:23:15,012
Yes.

210
00:23:15,721 --> 00:23:17,848
I said "Stop."
I screamed.

211
00:23:18,015 --> 00:23:21,059
I mean, that's how it
sounded in my head.

212
00:23:22,769 --> 00:23:24,480
He hurt me.

213
00:23:25,147 --> 00:23:27,107
Did you try to fight him?

214
00:23:29,818 --> 00:23:32,654
Well, he had my wrists
pinned behind me.

215
00:23:32,821 --> 00:23:34,198
Then what?

216
00:23:34,364 --> 00:23:37,618
He kept saying, "Let it happen.

217
00:23:37,993 --> 00:23:39,870
Let it happen."

218
00:23:41,663 --> 00:23:43,874
And then he just stopped.

219
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,251
You mean he withdrew?

220
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:49,797
I don't know. It's really hard
to remember, exactly.

221
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:52,174
Try, Kelly.

222
00:23:57,554 --> 00:23:59,556
I know one thing he said.

223
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:04,728
He said, "Don't worry.
I didn't come."

224
00:24:05,187 --> 00:24:07,189
I can't forget that.

225
00:24:08,607 --> 00:24:12,778
He said, "No little girl
can ever make me come."

226
00:24:16,573 --> 00:24:20,077
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus.

227
00:24:20,244 --> 00:24:23,330
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.

228
00:24:25,582 --> 00:24:26,834
What?

229
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,838
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

230
00:24:32,464 --> 00:24:35,592
You want my gut? There it is.
I think she's acting.

231
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,096
I think she set it up to be alone
with him so he'd come on to her.

232
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:40,931
She's upset because he didn't.

233
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:43,809
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.

234
00:24:43,976 --> 00:24:46,854
The guy never should've had her
there in the first place.

235
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:50,065
The line I have on him,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

236
00:24:50,274 --> 00:24:52,484
That doesn't make him a rapist.

237
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,945
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?

238
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:57,447
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?

239
00:24:57,614 --> 00:24:59,074
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.

240
00:24:59,241 --> 00:25:03,912
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector
test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

241
00:25:04,121 --> 00:25:07,291
You afraid of Tom Baxter now?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

242
00:25:07,458 --> 00:25:10,586
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.

243
00:25:10,752 --> 00:25:13,922
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.

244
00:25:14,089 --> 00:25:16,842
- You know what that'll mean for him.
- Yeah.

245
00:25:17,009 --> 00:25:22,222
And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.

246
00:26:14,858 --> 00:26:16,151
All right.

247
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,195
Good work, Jimbo.
I'll see you Monday.

248
00:26:18,362 --> 00:26:19,696
All right.

249
00:26:26,578 --> 00:26:29,206
That's what's left of my sailing class.

250
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:34,545
Talk to me, Artie.

251
00:26:35,712 --> 00:26:38,882
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.

252
00:26:39,967 --> 00:26:41,677
Jimmy told me.

253
00:26:42,219 --> 00:26:44,513
Apparently, I'm the last one
to know about it.

254
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,640
Sam, I...

255
00:26:47,558 --> 00:26:49,935
Sandra Van Ryan has been
on the horn all day...

256
00:26:50,102 --> 00:26:52,187
...with every member
of the school board.

257
00:26:52,396 --> 00:26:53,856
She's pushing for suspension.

258
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:57,860
And the board's just gonna roll over
for her without hearing my side?

259
00:26:58,026 --> 00:27:01,822
This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddamn it.

260
00:27:01,989 --> 00:27:03,448
You gotta believe that.

261
00:27:03,615 --> 00:27:05,868
All I can tell you, Sam,
is hang in there.

262
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:07,995
They clear you, you get reinstated...

263
00:27:08,203 --> 00:27:10,873
You never get clear
of something like this.

264
00:27:12,499 --> 00:27:14,001
It stays with you.

265
00:27:14,168 --> 00:27:17,588
It follows you around forever.

266
00:27:18,797 --> 00:27:20,549
You're gonna need some help, Sam.

267
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:23,719
You're gonna need an attorney.

268
00:27:23,886 --> 00:27:27,222
Right. And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...

269
00:27:27,431 --> 00:27:30,392
...is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.

270
00:27:48,827 --> 00:27:50,913
I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

271
00:27:51,079 --> 00:27:55,125
- Do you have an appointment?
- Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.

272
00:27:55,292 --> 00:27:57,419
Okay, then.

273
00:27:57,628 --> 00:28:00,130
Mr. Bowden,
your 10:30's here.

274
00:28:00,297 --> 00:28:02,299
Will you show him in, please?

275
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,137
What brings you
to this part of town?

276
00:28:08,138 --> 00:28:10,265
Well, I was, until yesterday...

277
00:28:10,432 --> 00:28:13,393
...a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.

278
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:17,356
A student there
is accusing me of rape.

279
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:20,400
Male or female?

280
00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:24,613
- The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
- As in Sandra Van Ryan?

281
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,241
As in, I'm fucked.

282
00:28:29,868 --> 00:28:31,453
Why don't you tell me about it?

283
00:28:33,539 --> 00:28:35,666
- Shit, where do I begin?
- Start with...

284
00:28:37,126 --> 00:28:39,837
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.

285
00:28:40,921 --> 00:28:45,342
She's a student. I was her counselor.
Beyond that, there's no relationship.

286
00:28:46,385 --> 00:28:47,928
You got nothing to worry about.

287
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,268
- What did you do to your neck?
- This?

288
00:28:54,893 --> 00:28:57,062
I don't have to wear it all the time.

289
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:03,777
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.

290
00:29:05,988 --> 00:29:08,949
All right, let me tell you
how I charge.

291
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,084
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?

292
00:29:19,251 --> 00:29:21,920
Mr. Lombardo, I'm afraid
I can't park your car today.

293
00:29:22,087 --> 00:29:25,674
You can't park me?
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

294
00:29:31,054 --> 00:29:34,141
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.

295
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:36,310
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

296
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:41,231
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

297
00:29:46,487 --> 00:29:49,281
Barbara, let's go.

298
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,996
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.

299
00:29:56,163 --> 00:29:58,665
You're finished in Blue Bay.

300
00:29:59,917 --> 00:30:04,505
I find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

301
00:30:05,297 --> 00:30:09,051
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Mr. Lombardo, please.

302
00:30:14,306 --> 00:30:16,141
That's all right, George.

303
00:30:39,581 --> 00:30:43,085
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.

304
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:46,505
- Welcome back.
- Rum and Coke.

305
00:32:16,887 --> 00:32:19,014
Hey! Are you all right?

306
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:21,600
- I'm fine.
- Cool?

307
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:23,936
That's too bad, motherfucker.

308
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:39,159
Sam?

309
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:46,208
Lombardo?

310
00:33:07,229 --> 00:33:10,107
Whoa, man! It's me.

311
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:14,820
Sorry, man. Things have been
getting a little weird around here.

312
00:33:14,987 --> 00:33:16,905
I can see that.

313
00:33:18,407 --> 00:33:20,325
Come on in.

314
00:33:23,328 --> 00:33:27,541
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy that did this to you?

315
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,793
It was him, all right.

316
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:32,546
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

317
00:33:32,713 --> 00:33:36,175
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

318
00:33:36,341 --> 00:33:39,595
- Forget it.
- The lady has deep pockets.

319
00:33:39,761 --> 00:33:42,473
Believe me, I know how deep
her pockets are.

320
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:47,102
I thought I might be able to save
my house. Some sort of equity loan.

321
00:33:47,478 --> 00:33:50,981
Guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

322
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:54,318
I don't need any more trouble
from this woman.

323
00:33:54,485 --> 00:33:57,613
You think making some sort
of statement's gonna stop her?

324
00:33:57,988 --> 00:34:00,949
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

325
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,577
A year ago...

326
00:34:03,744 --> 00:34:06,413
...when her old man
blew his brains out...

327
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,791
...Kelly lost it, ran away.

328
00:34:08,999 --> 00:34:13,170
They found her in a fleabag motel
some place, coked out of her gourd.

329
00:34:14,171 --> 00:34:15,923
Meanwhile...

330
00:34:16,089 --> 00:34:19,468
...you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...

331
00:34:19,676 --> 00:34:20,928
...or some crap.

332
00:34:21,303 --> 00:34:23,764
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...

333
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:27,100
...they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.

334
00:34:27,267 --> 00:34:30,020
Why do you think they haven't
taken your statement yet?

335
00:34:30,813 --> 00:34:32,815
Because they're busy
looking for dirt.

336
00:34:33,023 --> 00:34:34,775
And they're not gonna find it.

337
00:34:38,195 --> 00:34:40,030
Right?

338
00:34:41,365 --> 00:34:44,493
Ken, I don't fuck my students.

339
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,823
He's just showing off
for you now.

340
00:35:25,033 --> 00:35:27,161
Hey there, Ruby.

341
00:35:27,411 --> 00:35:29,621
I see you still got Walter.

342
00:35:30,205 --> 00:35:32,541
I was hoping something
had eaten him by now.

343
00:35:34,835 --> 00:35:37,880
- Can I help you with something?
- Suzie called us.

344
00:35:38,088 --> 00:35:40,132
Where would we find her?

345
00:35:41,383 --> 00:35:43,260
You know the way.

346
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:52,394
You won't shoot her, will you?

347
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:57,399
I don't believe she's armed.

348
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:34,895
Yeah?

349
00:36:39,608 --> 00:36:41,360
Jesus, it took you guys
long enough.

350
00:36:41,527 --> 00:36:46,323
What if someone was trying to
strangle me or fuck me in the ass?

351
00:36:48,575 --> 00:36:50,577
I mean,
you guys do sex crimes, right?

352
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,705
My partner, Detective Perez.

353
00:36:59,711 --> 00:37:04,007
It's Céline. He's okay. He had a good
line on what cheap fucks people are.

354
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:06,969
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us.
Remember?

355
00:37:15,018 --> 00:37:17,479
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

356
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,774
No.

357
00:37:21,775 --> 00:37:24,778
- Will they?
- I don't know.

358
00:37:25,362 --> 00:37:26,822
That bothers you?

359
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,202
I wanna go outside.

360
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:42,337
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?

361
00:37:42,504 --> 00:37:44,465
About a year ago.

362
00:37:44,673 --> 00:37:47,843
And when you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?

363
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,596
- Nope.
- So you were alone.

364
00:37:50,762 --> 00:37:52,431
Yeah.

365
00:37:52,598 --> 00:37:54,433
Did he come in with you?

366
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:59,188
- I guess.
- You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?

367
00:37:59,396 --> 00:38:02,316
Okay. Yeah, he did.

368
00:38:02,483 --> 00:38:04,067
And then what? Did he touch you?

369
00:38:04,234 --> 00:38:07,196
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?

370
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:10,741
Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.

371
00:38:11,283 --> 00:38:15,370
- Just tell us the truth.
- I didn't say a thing to him.

372
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:20,209
He just put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

373
00:38:21,001 --> 00:38:23,504
I could be really pretty, he said.

374
00:38:24,213 --> 00:38:25,881
Did you ask him to stop?

375
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,592
Shit.

376
00:38:29,051 --> 00:38:31,845
What difference does it make?
No one believes me anyway.

377
00:38:32,012 --> 00:38:35,224
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- Yeah. Okay? He did.

378
00:38:35,432 --> 00:38:37,726
He pushed me to the floor
and he did it to me.

379
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:42,731
- Now are we done?
- Almost, Suzie.

380
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,691
Almost.

381
00:38:45,776 --> 00:38:48,403
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?

382
00:38:49,446 --> 00:38:52,908
No. He stopped by himself.

383
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:56,578
Okay? Is that it?
Leave me alone.

384
00:38:57,121 --> 00:39:00,582
- Don't touch me!
- All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

385
00:39:00,749 --> 00:39:02,543
He stopped.

386
00:39:02,709 --> 00:39:05,921
And that was it? He just left?

387
00:39:06,463 --> 00:39:08,298
Yeah.

388
00:39:09,842 --> 00:39:12,136
He did say one thing first.

389
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:13,887
What was that?

390
00:39:14,638 --> 00:39:18,642
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

391
00:39:21,645 --> 00:39:23,480
Open the gate.

392
00:39:28,944 --> 00:39:32,281
- Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.

393
00:39:35,576 --> 00:39:38,829
You know, it's really a
bad news, good news situation.

394
00:39:39,788 --> 00:39:43,709
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...

395
00:39:43,876 --> 00:39:45,919
...instead of a public defender.

396
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,298
I'm telling you, Ken, I'm innocent.

397
00:39:50,174 --> 00:39:53,969
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

398
00:40:01,101 --> 00:40:03,479
So you're the new
chicken licker.

399
00:40:12,696 --> 00:40:14,364
Sandra, can we get your comment?

400
00:40:14,531 --> 00:40:16,658
Can I just have your feelings
at this time?

401
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:19,328
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.

402
00:40:20,037 --> 00:40:21,622
Can you tell us anything?

403
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:24,124
- Are you confident about the case?
- Very. Yes.

404
00:40:24,291 --> 00:40:27,169
The Lombardo rape case
has galvanized the upscale town...

405
00:40:27,336 --> 00:40:29,296
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.

406
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:31,381
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...

407
00:40:31,548 --> 00:40:35,427
...jet-set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

408
00:40:35,594 --> 00:40:39,264
And the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. In the end, the jury...

409
00:40:39,431 --> 00:40:42,309
...must choose between the words
of these 18-year-old girls...

410
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:44,061
...and that of Sam Lombardo.

411
00:40:44,228 --> 00:40:46,897
Reporting from the courthouse steps,
I'm Nancy Duerr.

412
00:40:47,064 --> 00:40:48,732
Eyewitness News.

413
00:41:28,522 --> 00:41:30,941
The State of Florida
v. Sam Lombardo.

414
00:41:31,108 --> 00:41:35,028
The Honorable Sylvia B. Waxman
presiding. All rise.

415
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,239
We gotta stand up.

416
00:41:40,909 --> 00:41:42,369
Please be seated.

417
00:41:42,578 --> 00:41:44,246
Now sit down.

418
00:41:58,218 --> 00:42:00,053
Would you like more time, Kelly?

419
00:42:05,642 --> 00:42:08,770
I know that this is hard, Kelly...

420
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,940
...but I have one more question.

421
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:14,943
And even though it's something
we've been over...

422
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:18,363
...I want us all
to be very clear about it.

423
00:42:19,406 --> 00:42:23,285
Kelly, when you saw
that Mr. Lombardo...

424
00:42:23,911 --> 00:42:26,663
...intended to have sex with you...

425
00:42:26,830 --> 00:42:28,957
...what were your exact words?

426
00:42:29,541 --> 00:42:31,460
What did you say?

427
00:42:32,669 --> 00:42:35,088
I told him "No."

428
00:42:36,256 --> 00:42:38,926
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please."

429
00:42:41,512 --> 00:42:44,515
I screamed for him to stop.

430
00:42:45,098 --> 00:42:46,975
You screamed for him...

431
00:42:47,726 --> 00:42:49,520
...to stop.

432
00:42:50,687 --> 00:42:52,481
And did he?

433
00:42:53,941 --> 00:42:55,651
No.

434
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:59,655
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.

435
00:43:07,913 --> 00:43:09,790
Thank you.

436
00:43:15,796 --> 00:43:15,963
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

437
00:43:15,963 --> 00:43:19,716
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

438
00:43:19,883 --> 00:43:22,678
...of the former guidance counselor
has taken the stand.

439
00:43:22,886 --> 00:43:26,682
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan delivered
an emotional account of events...

440
00:43:26,849 --> 00:43:30,269
...and was not swayed by
defense counsel's cross-examination.

441
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:33,647
We'll come back live later
with an update of these proceedings.

442
00:43:33,814 --> 00:43:36,608
Reporting from the courthouse
steps, I'm Nancy Duerr...

443
00:43:36,775 --> 00:43:38,694
...Eyewitness News.

444
00:43:57,379 --> 00:43:59,047
Good morning, everybody.

445
00:44:01,258 --> 00:44:02,718
Ms. Toller.

446
00:44:04,136 --> 00:44:06,180
When you were...

447
00:44:06,346 --> 00:44:09,975
...picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...

448
00:44:10,142 --> 00:44:13,187
...and you were allowed
to make one call...

449
00:44:13,395 --> 00:44:16,565
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
Isn't that correct?

450
00:44:17,941 --> 00:44:19,610
Ms. Toller?

451
00:44:20,277 --> 00:44:22,529
- Yes.
- And when you were expelled...

452
00:44:22,696 --> 00:44:25,073
...for destruction
of school property...

453
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,452
I broke a fucking window.
And it wasn't even my fault.

454
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:33,207
Ms. Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...

455
00:44:33,415 --> 00:44:36,710
...and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.

456
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:44,510
It was Mr. Lombardo who appeared
with you in lieu of a parent conference.

457
00:44:44,676 --> 00:44:46,178
Is that right?

458
00:44:46,345 --> 00:44:47,721
Yes.

459
00:44:49,181 --> 00:44:51,099
It seems to me...

460
00:44:51,308 --> 00:44:54,603
...that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.

461
00:44:54,812 --> 00:44:56,480
He was.

462
00:44:57,648 --> 00:45:00,651
But all that changed when...

463
00:45:01,985 --> 00:45:04,279
...according to your testimony...

464
00:45:05,113 --> 00:45:07,282
...Mr. Lombardo...

465
00:45:07,449 --> 00:45:09,159
...raped you...

466
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:14,498
...on April 23 of last year,
is that right?

467
00:45:15,249 --> 00:45:17,459
- Yes.
- But then in May...

468
00:45:18,085 --> 00:45:21,588
...when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...

469
00:45:21,797 --> 00:45:24,258
...and again allowed a phone call...

470
00:45:25,884 --> 00:45:27,427
...you called Mr. Lombardo.

471
00:45:32,516 --> 00:45:35,811
- So what?
- So what?

472
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:40,440
So what?

473
00:45:43,193 --> 00:45:44,987
Oops, Suzie.

474
00:45:46,113 --> 00:45:50,868
So one month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

475
00:45:53,495 --> 00:45:56,665
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a good friend.

476
00:45:56,832 --> 00:45:59,376
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did.

477
00:45:59,710 --> 00:46:01,712
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.

478
00:46:01,879 --> 00:46:03,630
It was summer, he was gone...

479
00:46:04,214 --> 00:46:08,385
...and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.

480
00:46:08,886 --> 00:46:10,971
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

481
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:14,850
...that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?

482
00:46:16,393 --> 00:46:19,730
Is that why you're saying
these things about Mr. Lombardo...

483
00:46:19,897 --> 00:46:22,524
...your friend?
- I said them because they happened.

484
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:25,486
Ms. Toller, are you gonna
sit there today, under oath...

485
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:28,030
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?

486
00:46:28,197 --> 00:46:30,199
I said he did.

487
00:46:30,574 --> 00:46:33,035
Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Toller.

488
00:46:33,243 --> 00:46:36,872
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

489
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:40,042
Because I promise you,
if you are lying about this...

490
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:41,835
...and I believe you are...

491
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:45,464
...that you will be visiting
that facility again quite soon.

492
00:46:45,756 --> 00:46:49,802
Which is why I'm gonna ask you
again now, under oath.

493
00:46:49,968 --> 00:46:51,637
Suzie...

494
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:55,057
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

495
00:46:59,770 --> 00:47:03,148
Ms. Toller, you will have to
answer the question.

496
00:47:07,236 --> 00:47:09,363
- Ms. Toller.
- Goddamn it!

497
00:47:11,907 --> 00:47:14,201
- This was not my idea.
- Objection, Your Honor.

498
00:47:14,535 --> 00:47:18,038
Ms. Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.

499
00:47:18,205 --> 00:47:21,416
Court would like to hear
what Ms. Toller has to say.

500
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,669
Ms. Toller?

501
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,049
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

502
00:47:30,634 --> 00:47:32,803
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.

503
00:47:32,970 --> 00:47:37,432
This is ridiculous. The witness has
been threatened by defense counsel!

504
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:41,103
I think I made it plain this court
intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.

505
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:44,773
Ms. Toller.

506
00:47:45,983 --> 00:47:48,777
I just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.

507
00:47:49,486 --> 00:47:52,489
He was my friend at first.

508
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:55,742
And then I got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...

509
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:58,287
...and I had to go away
to that hell hole.

510
00:47:58,495 --> 00:48:01,081
It's like you're his favorite,
and then "Who cares?"

511
00:48:01,248 --> 00:48:02,666
Make her stop.

512
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:05,294
When Kelly said that
we should do this...

513
00:48:05,461 --> 00:48:07,296
...I thought, "Cool."
- Kelly!

514
00:48:07,504 --> 00:48:10,799
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop, Duquette.

515
00:48:10,966 --> 00:48:14,136
- Now they're gonna get screwed.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

516
00:48:14,344 --> 00:48:15,637
I have to object.

517
00:48:15,804 --> 00:48:18,557
Your Honor, please, may I be heard?

518
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:22,603
Mr. Baxter, you are not
trying this case.

519
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,021
Go sit down.

520
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:31,778
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.

521
00:48:32,571 --> 00:48:34,823
She's in love with him.

522
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,242
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.

523
00:48:37,409 --> 00:48:40,287
Then she found out he was doing
her mom, and that was it.

524
00:48:40,454 --> 00:48:42,331
What? Kelly!

525
00:48:42,539 --> 00:48:44,666
You skanky bitch!

526
00:48:45,709 --> 00:48:48,796
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who I am?

527
00:48:48,962 --> 00:48:52,090
- I'm gonna have you fired on Monday!
- Right this way.

528
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,473
Just get the hell away from me.

529
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,685
Jesus, man! Let loose!

530
00:49:04,978 --> 00:49:07,981
I'm just thinking about where
I'm gonna stay.

531
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:10,442
I lost my house.

532
00:49:10,609 --> 00:49:12,653
Waking up from
a goddamn nightmare.

533
00:49:12,861 --> 00:49:14,321
You'll get over it.

534
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:17,658
We have got a knockdown,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

535
00:49:17,825 --> 00:49:20,160
...against Sandra Van Ryan.

536
00:49:20,327 --> 00:49:22,162
Just like that?

537
00:49:22,329 --> 00:49:23,580
Just like that?

538
00:49:24,331 --> 00:49:26,375
These people ruined your life, bro.

539
00:49:26,750 --> 00:49:31,171
I told you they were gonna go too far.
They went overboard! They did!

540
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:35,801
They'll settle. Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.

541
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:39,680
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.

542
00:49:39,847 --> 00:49:43,100
In a startling turn of events,
Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...

543
00:49:43,267 --> 00:49:46,854
...following a reversal of testimony
by one of his alleged victims.

544
00:49:47,104 --> 00:49:49,064
Excuse me. Over here.

545
00:49:49,231 --> 00:49:50,899
Excuse me. Can anybody read?

546
00:49:51,358 --> 00:49:54,862
Hey! Sandra!

547
00:49:55,112 --> 00:49:59,032
I want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

548
00:49:59,199 --> 00:50:02,161
We could have,
if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...

549
00:50:02,327 --> 00:50:04,371
...hadn't thrown things.
- Fuck off.

550
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,543
I cannot believe you're just gonna
let them get away with this shit!

551
00:50:09,751 --> 00:50:12,379
All on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.

552
00:50:12,546 --> 00:50:15,507
I don't think you get it, Sandy.

553
00:50:15,674 --> 00:50:17,676
Your princess here
committed perjury.

554
00:50:18,302 --> 00:50:21,597
It'll be all I can do to keep
her fucking little ass out of jail.

555
00:50:21,805 --> 00:50:24,850
Well, what are we going to do?

556
00:50:32,441 --> 00:50:35,319
- You're gonna love this place, Tom.
- Thank you.

557
00:50:36,778 --> 00:50:38,947
That jalapeño pork platter
will kill you.

558
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:44,536
I mean, you can't eat sushi every day
of the week.

559
00:50:44,703 --> 00:50:47,122
Bowden, why don't you
cut the crap...

560
00:50:47,289 --> 00:50:50,250
...and tell me
what your client really wants.

561
00:50:53,170 --> 00:50:55,130
Okay, Baxter.

562
00:50:55,297 --> 00:50:59,176
My client wants your client
to saddle up...

563
00:50:59,343 --> 00:51:01,929
...so we can ride her ass
straight to the bank.

564
00:51:05,182 --> 00:51:08,143
You know, Ken.

565
00:51:08,435 --> 00:51:09,686
May I call you Ken?

566
00:51:11,772 --> 00:51:14,483
There will be other cases,
other days.

567
00:51:17,027 --> 00:51:19,404
The way I see it...

568
00:51:20,155 --> 00:51:21,865
...Tommy...

569
00:51:22,032 --> 00:51:25,369
...is that everybody's gotta
eat some shit sometime.

570
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:29,081
You like yours hot?

571
00:51:29,248 --> 00:51:31,041
Yeah.

572
00:51:39,049 --> 00:51:41,969
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.

573
00:51:55,566 --> 00:51:57,234
Ken.

574
00:52:09,371 --> 00:52:11,623
Sorry I'm late.

575
00:52:11,790 --> 00:52:13,208
Hold my calls, Lenore.

576
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:15,419
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

577
00:52:38,108 --> 00:52:40,110
Thank you, Sandra.

578
00:52:45,574 --> 00:52:47,451
I'll be seeing you.

579
00:52:47,618 --> 00:52:49,912
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

580
00:52:56,084 --> 00:52:58,295
Nice to see you, Tom.

581
00:52:58,629 --> 00:53:00,214
Come by.
We'll have lunch.

582
00:53:03,801 --> 00:53:05,928
See you at the club.

583
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:10,224
See you at the club.

584
00:53:10,933 --> 00:53:13,101
See you at the club.

585
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,270
See you at the club.

586
00:53:15,938 --> 00:53:17,606
See you at the club, Tommy!

587
00:53:17,773 --> 00:53:20,776
Hey, Tom.
What did you shoot today, pal?

588
00:53:20,984 --> 00:53:23,028
Hey, my man!

589
00:53:25,072 --> 00:53:27,157
This is for you.

590
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,952
- You did good, Ken.
- Yeah.

591
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:31,787
Thanks.

592
00:53:32,996 --> 00:53:37,000
I know there's a part of you that wishes
none of this had happened, but it did.

593
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:39,962
So take the money
and enjoy yourself.

594
00:53:40,170 --> 00:53:43,173
All right? Find a happy place.

595
00:53:43,382 --> 00:53:46,093
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?

596
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:49,471
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye, Lenore.

597
00:54:06,864 --> 00:54:09,324
Take care of my lizards?

598
00:54:17,666 --> 00:54:18,917
Hello, Kelly.

599
00:54:19,501 --> 00:54:21,086
Drop dead.

600
00:54:21,253 --> 00:54:25,466
You know how my mom's paying you
off? She's breaking my trust.

601
00:54:25,841 --> 00:54:30,095
I can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.

602
00:54:30,262 --> 00:54:31,513
I'm sorry, Kelly.

603
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,683
Why don't you start fucking her
again! You can spend it together!

604
00:54:34,850 --> 00:54:37,519
I hate you! I fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!

605
00:54:38,061 --> 00:54:40,022
I fucking hate you!

606
00:54:52,201 --> 00:54:56,246
You see, Art? I couldn't come back
even if I wanted to.

607
00:55:33,909 --> 00:55:35,953
Goddamn maid.

608
00:56:11,572 --> 00:56:13,490
So you got my mom's money.

609
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:16,785
How much?

610
00:56:17,703 --> 00:56:19,204
How much?

611
00:56:19,955 --> 00:56:22,207
You know how much.

612
00:56:22,458 --> 00:56:24,251
Your turn to pay.

613
00:56:27,463 --> 00:56:30,799
It worked! We screwed the bitch!

614
00:56:31,633 --> 00:56:34,344
It worked just like you said.

615
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:37,139
What's wrong?

616
00:56:37,306 --> 00:56:40,601
You scared the shit out of me.
What's wrong is your coming here.

617
00:56:40,767 --> 00:56:44,396
That's what's wrong.
Are you fucking crazy?

618
00:56:45,481 --> 00:56:48,859
Yeah, I'm crazy. Ask my mom.

619
00:56:52,196 --> 00:56:55,532
So how much is 8.5 million
divided by three?

620
00:56:56,658 --> 00:56:59,787
Oh, great. Yeah, this is a big joke.
Big joke.

621
00:56:59,995 --> 00:57:03,916
Everyone thinks this is really funny.
Do you think this is fucking over?

622
00:57:04,082 --> 00:57:07,628
Let me tell you something.
It's a long fucking way from over.

623
00:57:09,004 --> 00:57:11,173
I'm serious.

624
00:57:13,634 --> 00:57:17,596
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.

625
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,934
After tonight?

626
00:57:22,851 --> 00:57:24,645
Yeah, well...

627
00:57:25,187 --> 00:57:27,189
...we're here, aren't we?

628
00:57:30,067 --> 00:57:32,694
So maybe one celebration
is okay...

629
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:35,614
...if we're in agreement...

630
00:57:36,532 --> 00:57:38,367
...that from here on out...

631
00:57:40,369 --> 00:57:43,163
...you do exactly as I say.

632
00:58:25,664 --> 00:58:29,168
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.

633
00:58:41,889 --> 00:58:44,349
Now I want you two to kiss.

634
00:58:45,976 --> 00:58:47,936
Come on, now.

635
00:58:48,103 --> 00:58:51,231
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.

636
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:11,979
I told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.

637
01:00:12,563 --> 01:00:16,358
Hey, you're right.
They did make us look stupid.

638
01:00:16,942 --> 01:00:18,944
What you're wrong about is why.

639
01:00:19,695 --> 01:00:21,071
All right, hear me out.

640
01:00:21,530 --> 01:00:24,491
Lombardo was having an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan, right?

641
01:00:24,658 --> 01:00:25,951
Why not tell us about it?

642
01:00:26,118 --> 01:00:29,455
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.

643
01:00:29,621 --> 01:00:32,708
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.

644
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:36,211
I thought about it and said: "You're
Lombardo. Your life is trashed.

645
01:00:36,378 --> 01:00:39,298
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless..."

646
01:00:39,465 --> 01:00:41,175
Unless what?

647
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:46,513
Unless you're setting Sandra
Van Ryan up for the big payday.

648
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:50,100
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...

649
01:00:50,267 --> 01:00:54,229
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl
like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.

650
01:00:54,396 --> 01:00:56,815
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?

651
01:00:56,982 --> 01:01:00,903
Kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.

652
01:01:01,153 --> 01:01:05,449
I'm telling you,
this guy wanted to marry money.

653
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,703
When that didn't happen,
he went to work on these two girls...

654
01:01:09,912 --> 01:01:11,872
...using them to set up
Sandra Van Ryan.

655
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:14,291
I'm telling you,
they chumped us, partner.

656
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:17,419
They chumped us
right from the start.

657
01:02:11,932 --> 01:02:13,767
Nice stroke.

658
01:02:15,477 --> 01:02:17,437
Is there some reason
why you're here?

659
01:02:17,646 --> 01:02:19,898
- Curiosity, I guess.
- About what?

660
01:02:20,065 --> 01:02:22,776
How to improve your breast stroke?

661
01:02:24,278 --> 01:02:28,407
No. I want to know how you see things
working out for you, Sam and Suzie.

662
01:02:30,159 --> 01:02:31,452
Excuse me?

663
01:02:31,618 --> 01:02:33,954
You three gonna
go to the Caribbean together?

664
01:02:34,121 --> 01:02:35,539
Live happily ever after?

665
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:39,126
You see, the thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.

666
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:40,544
You're out of your mind.

667
01:02:40,711 --> 01:02:44,047
It's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.

668
01:02:44,214 --> 01:02:47,092
Especially when
two of them are in love.

669
01:02:47,676 --> 01:02:51,889
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.

670
01:02:52,848 --> 01:02:54,349
Am I right?

671
01:02:54,516 --> 01:02:57,853
Sam sell you on the idea right up
front of whacking Suzie? Hey!

672
01:02:59,521 --> 01:03:01,315
That's murder, kid.

673
01:03:01,523 --> 01:03:04,651
Police. God, get a life.

674
01:03:06,361 --> 01:03:08,363
You're good, you know that?

675
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,328
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?

676
01:03:35,432 --> 01:03:37,643
Hello, Suzie.

677
01:03:38,519 --> 01:03:40,229
You better watch it
with that shit.

678
01:03:40,395 --> 01:03:43,106
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.

679
01:03:43,273 --> 01:03:45,442
Yeah, or wind up dead.

680
01:03:52,741 --> 01:03:54,368
You know...

681
01:03:55,577 --> 01:03:59,706
...I don't think I ever told you
how sorry I was about your friend.

682
01:03:59,998 --> 01:04:01,917
What was his name?

683
01:04:05,129 --> 01:04:08,674
Come on, help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.

684
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:15,556
- Davy.
- Yeah. That's right. Davy.

685
01:04:15,848 --> 01:04:17,975
I was sorry about
the way that worked out.

686
01:04:18,142 --> 01:04:20,936
- That is cop bullshit.
- What was that? What was that?

687
01:04:21,103 --> 01:04:24,106
I don't have to listen to this.
You can't shove me around.

688
01:04:24,273 --> 01:04:26,441
- I have friends now.
- Hey!

689
01:04:26,608 --> 01:04:29,403
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!

690
01:04:29,570 --> 01:04:33,073
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.

691
01:04:37,494 --> 01:04:39,455
Take a look at this.

692
01:04:40,205 --> 01:04:42,666
Go ahead, take it.
It's not gonna bite you.

693
01:04:43,167 --> 01:04:44,418
Take it!

694
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:51,258
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.

695
01:04:52,593 --> 01:04:56,638
He transferred the funds to
a numbered offshore account.

696
01:04:56,805 --> 01:04:59,850
Cops don't know the names on it.
Think one of them is yours?

697
01:05:00,809 --> 01:05:05,022
He also put a down payment on island
property and a lease on a sailboat.

698
01:05:05,189 --> 01:05:06,815
You're into sailing, aren't you?

699
01:05:06,982 --> 01:05:10,152
I don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?

700
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,405
I'm telling you this because
I know exactly what's going on.

701
01:05:14,323 --> 01:05:17,618
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.

702
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,745
Come on, now.

703
01:05:19,912 --> 01:05:23,499
You don't think Kelly and Sam are
gonna share that money with you.

704
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:27,753
Leave me alone.

705
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:37,805
You know...

706
01:05:37,971 --> 01:05:40,641
...l'd want a clear head
right now if I were you...

707
01:05:41,475 --> 01:05:45,562
...so I could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.

708
01:05:46,814 --> 01:05:49,775
I'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...

709
01:05:50,192 --> 01:05:51,985
...like Davy.

710
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:05,749
Oh, shit.

711
01:06:12,214 --> 01:06:16,176
You've reached Sam Lombardo.
Wait for the beep, leave a message.

712
01:06:31,191 --> 01:06:34,528
I can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?

713
01:06:34,695 --> 01:06:37,030
I'm scared there's no one to trust.

714
01:06:37,197 --> 01:06:39,533
You can trust me.

715
01:06:46,290 --> 01:06:47,749
Hello?

716
01:06:48,417 --> 01:06:50,961
- Kelly, is Suzie there?
- Yeah.

717
01:06:51,128 --> 01:06:53,088
Christ, I was afraid of that.

718
01:06:53,255 --> 01:06:55,257
She left this insane message.

719
01:06:55,424 --> 01:06:57,885
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...

720
01:06:58,051 --> 01:07:00,345
...and this fucking cop,
she's gonna blow it.

721
01:07:01,597 --> 01:07:03,348
Calm the bitch down.

722
01:07:03,515 --> 01:07:06,477
Why can't you come? Please?

723
01:07:07,227 --> 01:07:10,772
Sam, I miss you so much.

724
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:17,279
I miss you too, Kelly,
but I can't right now.

725
01:07:17,446 --> 01:07:19,448
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?

726
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:22,409
If she can't get a fucking grip...

727
01:07:22,576 --> 01:07:25,621
- Then what?
- You know what.

728
01:07:26,288 --> 01:07:27,998
I'll handle it.

729
01:07:28,165 --> 01:07:31,543
But I need you, Kelly.
I need you to be there for me tonight.

730
01:07:32,795 --> 01:07:34,963
- Okay.
- Good.

731
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:38,008
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know that?

732
01:07:39,259 --> 01:07:42,679
Now, put Suzie on the line.
I want you both to hear this.

733
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,390
Suzie.

734
01:07:46,308 --> 01:07:47,935
Sam?

735
01:07:48,143 --> 01:07:49,603
Now, look...

736
01:07:49,812 --> 01:07:52,689
...we gotta stay calm, all of us.

737
01:07:52,856 --> 01:07:56,109
Now, since the settlement,
people think I'm rich...

738
01:07:56,276 --> 01:07:59,655
...so I'm out there spending money,
doing what rich guys do.

739
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:03,742
This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try
and fuck with you. Don't let him.

740
01:08:03,909 --> 01:08:08,038
- Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
- Suzie, don't fall apart.

741
01:08:08,247 --> 01:08:11,125
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.

742
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:22,052
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?

743
01:08:22,219 --> 01:08:24,263
Oh, for chrissake.

744
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:25,931
You are!

745
01:08:26,098 --> 01:08:30,519
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?

746
01:08:30,686 --> 01:08:35,399
That's what I am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.

747
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:37,860
Don't!

748
01:08:41,697 --> 01:08:44,074
You stupid cunt!

749
01:09:16,273 --> 01:09:18,650
You are scared, aren't you?

750
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:46,864
Ray! Jesus Christ!

751
01:10:47,239 --> 01:10:49,241
- Are you crazy?
- Hear her say "Sam"?

752
01:10:49,533 --> 01:10:52,619
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.

753
01:10:52,828 --> 01:10:55,122
The conversation on the tape
is unintelligible.

754
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,916
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...

755
01:10:58,083 --> 01:11:00,919
...shooting a porn flick!
- I can't believe this.

756
01:11:01,086 --> 01:11:04,006
A month ago, they threw things
at each other in court.

757
01:11:04,173 --> 01:11:06,800
They were acting!
They were all acting!

758
01:11:07,009 --> 01:11:08,802
We bought it, hook, line and sinker.

759
01:11:09,011 --> 01:11:11,930
They're getting away with $8 million
from Sandra Van Ryan.

760
01:11:12,097 --> 01:11:14,808
She might have saved it
if she didn't try to ruin him.

761
01:11:14,975 --> 01:11:18,187
You wouldn't go after a guy
you thought raped your daughter?

762
01:11:18,353 --> 01:11:20,689
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!

763
01:11:20,856 --> 01:11:24,735
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!

764
01:11:25,194 --> 01:11:28,405
I've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep mucking around...

765
01:11:28,572 --> 01:11:31,074
...and she's gonna sue us
for invasion of privacy.

766
01:11:31,241 --> 01:11:33,827
So get out of these people's lives!
Hey! Ray!

767
01:11:34,703 --> 01:11:38,540
- Hey! Am I getting through?
- You think this is just about money?

768
01:11:38,707 --> 01:11:40,834
About us looking stupid?
Question him.

769
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:46,173
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.

770
01:11:46,340 --> 01:11:47,716
Give him something to do.

771
01:11:47,883 --> 01:11:50,552
- Look into the Kennedy assassination.
- I understand.

772
01:11:50,719 --> 01:11:53,263
Next time this fucking piece of shit...

773
01:11:53,430 --> 01:11:55,474
...drags me down here,
I'm gonna sue you.

774
01:11:55,641 --> 01:11:57,976
You're goddamn lucky
I didn't sue last time.

775
01:11:58,185 --> 01:12:00,229
- I agree.
- Am I free to go?

776
01:12:00,395 --> 01:12:02,606
- Yes.
- Thank you.

777
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:07,736
- Cocksucker.
- Yeah, what was that?

778
01:12:07,903 --> 01:12:11,573
- You heard me, motherfucker.
- Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?

779
01:12:15,244 --> 01:12:16,954
What are you looking at?

780
01:13:00,998 --> 01:13:04,376
- I guess I kind of lost it out there.
- You could say that.

781
01:13:08,797 --> 01:13:11,884
Were you ever in a situation
where you saw something coming...

782
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:14,386
...and you didn't do
what you could to stop it?

783
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:16,346
We all have.

784
01:13:16,513 --> 01:13:20,392
I mean something bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...

785
01:13:20,976 --> 01:13:24,188
...and you...
You didn't do anything, and...

786
01:13:28,317 --> 01:13:30,110
I did that once.

787
01:13:32,154 --> 01:13:34,281
I don't wanna do it again.

788
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:55,385
I thought we were going to a movie.

789
01:13:57,763 --> 01:14:00,682
I think we just need to get wasted.

790
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:02,976
Yeah.

791
01:14:20,828 --> 01:14:22,371
Come on.

792
01:14:29,211 --> 01:14:31,839
I wanna live at the beach someday.

793
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:33,882
Oh, shit.

794
01:14:34,049 --> 01:14:36,760
I left the keys.

795
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:38,512
I'll get them.

796
01:14:58,282 --> 01:14:59,658
Kelly?

797
01:14:59,825 --> 01:15:01,452
Suzie.

798
01:15:03,954 --> 01:15:05,706
It's me.

799
01:15:10,544 --> 01:15:13,505
I was worried about you,
and I decided...

800
01:15:13,672 --> 01:15:17,926
...the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.

801
01:15:18,552 --> 01:15:21,472
- Are you mad at me?
- No, no.

802
01:15:21,638 --> 01:15:24,099
I probably should've told you
a bit more about...

803
01:15:24,266 --> 01:15:26,560
...the part I intended to play.

804
01:15:26,727 --> 01:15:28,645
But we'll go through it again tonight.

805
01:15:32,941 --> 01:15:36,862
This is a celebration, Suzie,
not a suicide pact.

806
01:15:37,112 --> 01:15:40,991
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...

807
01:15:41,158 --> 01:15:43,702
...have a little champagne...

808
01:15:43,869 --> 01:15:45,662
...watch the stars...

809
01:15:46,789 --> 01:15:48,081
Kelly?

810
01:15:48,290 --> 01:15:50,918
You got a blanket in the back
of your mom's Rover?

811
01:15:52,044 --> 01:15:55,047
Why don't you be an angel
and run over and get it for us?

812
01:15:57,633 --> 01:15:59,301
Good girl.

813
01:16:00,969 --> 01:16:03,472
Let me tell you about the boat
I picked out for us.

814
01:17:06,827 --> 01:17:08,495
You okay?

815
01:17:10,038 --> 01:17:13,333
My mom would kill me
if she knew I took the Rover.

816
01:18:13,852 --> 01:18:15,062
Been four-wheeling?

817
01:18:16,772 --> 01:18:19,274
- Get off my property!
- I'm not on your property.

818
01:18:19,441 --> 01:18:22,611
- Lf you don't get out of here...
- You'll call a cop? I am a cop!

819
01:18:23,237 --> 01:18:24,446
Goddamn it!

820
01:18:46,426 --> 01:18:48,595
So you say she didn't
come home last night.

821
01:18:48,762 --> 01:18:53,058
She's been talking about going to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.

822
01:18:53,225 --> 01:18:56,270
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.

823
01:18:59,064 --> 01:19:02,192
Found some teeth in an old trailer
down the road.

824
01:19:02,359 --> 01:19:04,444
He says they'll fit.

825
01:19:04,903 --> 01:19:08,574
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.

826
01:19:08,740 --> 01:19:12,453
Oh, and now they're saying
that she can't graduate.

827
01:19:12,619 --> 01:19:16,665
It is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her
into this whole mess, and you know it.

828
01:19:16,832 --> 01:19:19,042
Well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.

829
01:19:19,209 --> 01:19:22,212
We find something,
you'll be the first to know.

830
01:19:23,672 --> 01:19:25,090
Come on.

831
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:45,944
It's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.

832
01:19:46,111 --> 01:19:49,239
Ray, we don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.

833
01:19:49,406 --> 01:19:51,909
I'll drop you off.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.

834
01:19:52,075 --> 01:19:53,702
You got someplace you wanna be?

835
01:19:54,536 --> 01:19:57,790
- You got a date?
- Just check the car out for me.

836
01:20:07,549 --> 01:20:09,843
It's over here, by that old boat.

837
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:13,639
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?

838
01:20:13,806 --> 01:20:15,724
Yeah, sometimes.

839
01:20:15,891 --> 01:20:18,310
A lot of the kids hang out here.

840
01:20:19,895 --> 01:20:22,648
You really think something bad
happened to Suzie?

841
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:25,359
Lombardo ever come out here?

842
01:20:27,653 --> 01:20:29,363
I say something funny?

843
01:20:29,571 --> 01:20:33,742
No, but I mean, just the idea
that Mr. Lombardo would...

844
01:20:33,909 --> 01:20:37,496
Well, the way I heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.

845
01:20:37,663 --> 01:20:39,206
You and him were pals, right?

846
01:20:39,373 --> 01:20:42,626
Yeah, but he got me
onto the sailing team.

847
01:20:42,793 --> 01:20:45,754
Told me I could work my way
through college, like he did.

848
01:20:45,921 --> 01:20:49,842
Sam Lombardo went to the University
of Miami on an athletic scholarship.

849
01:20:50,008 --> 01:20:53,971
Boats didn't have a damn thing
to do with it.

850
01:21:44,521 --> 01:21:46,523
Listen, I'm gonna be here a while, kid.

851
01:21:46,690 --> 01:21:49,526
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?

852
01:21:55,365 --> 01:21:56,992
Hey, Jimmy.

853
01:21:59,203 --> 01:22:03,665
People aren't always what they
appear to be. Don't forget that.

854
01:22:21,099 --> 01:22:23,393
- This is where they did it.
- Where's the body?

855
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,646
The swamp, most likely.
Guy's a swamp rat.

856
01:22:25,854 --> 01:22:28,315
He knows it won't be found,
but he made a mistake.

857
01:22:28,524 --> 01:22:32,319
She'd been threatening to run away
and I found the car at the bus terminal.

858
01:22:32,486 --> 01:22:34,154
You don't think Sam put it there?

859
01:22:34,363 --> 01:22:37,574
Hold on a second.
Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.

860
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:41,161
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.

861
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:43,497
Little sociopath's the one
who started this.

862
01:22:43,705 --> 01:22:46,750
- How long till we get something?
- We can get blood type now.

863
01:22:46,917 --> 01:22:50,420
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.

864
01:22:52,047 --> 01:22:54,007
Poor, dumb Suzie.
Kid never had a chance.

865
01:22:54,216 --> 01:22:56,844
- We don't know that.
- I'm telling you, Kelly's next.

866
01:22:57,052 --> 01:23:00,848
I'm telling you, you get
off this right now.

867
01:23:01,098 --> 01:23:05,269
Don't even fucking let me hear
about you bothering Lombardo.

868
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:10,232
David!

869
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:12,776
You get an ID, you call me!

870
01:23:15,154 --> 01:23:16,363
Will you do me a favor?

871
01:23:17,573 --> 01:23:19,199
Ray, you heard him.

872
01:23:19,366 --> 01:23:22,327
He told me to stay away.
He didn't say anything about you.

873
01:23:22,494 --> 01:23:24,997
What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong?

874
01:23:25,164 --> 01:23:27,624
Please, you gotta help me out
on this, partner.

875
01:23:28,041 --> 01:23:31,336
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?

876
01:23:32,588 --> 01:23:36,508
If I'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.

877
01:24:19,968 --> 01:24:22,679
- Hello?
- I've been calling you.

878
01:24:22,846 --> 01:24:24,640
- I wanna see you.
- Where are you?

879
01:24:24,807 --> 01:24:27,476
- The stupid guest house.
- Good. Stay there.

880
01:24:27,643 --> 01:24:29,436
Sam, I'm really nervous.

881
01:24:29,978 --> 01:24:32,231
Kelly, relax.

882
01:24:32,523 --> 01:24:34,983
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.

883
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:38,862
In a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.

884
01:24:39,029 --> 01:24:41,156
But what if they find out?

885
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,201
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.

886
01:24:44,368 --> 01:24:45,828
Look, Kelly...

887
01:24:45,994 --> 01:24:48,872
...stay in the guest house,
skip the graduation parties.

888
01:24:49,331 --> 01:24:51,583
I love you so much.

889
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:53,710
And I love you too, Kelly.

890
01:24:53,877 --> 01:24:55,838
Be a good girl
and stay where you are.

891
01:25:19,027 --> 01:25:21,488
Peeping in people's windows?

892
01:25:22,197 --> 01:25:23,615
Isn't that against the law?

893
01:25:25,492 --> 01:25:27,244
Suzie Toller's missing.

894
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:30,956
- Since when?
- She didn't come home last night.

895
01:25:31,290 --> 01:25:34,084
We found her car
at the bus terminal.

896
01:25:34,376 --> 01:25:36,044
Ray thinks she was murdered.

897
01:25:36,795 --> 01:25:38,922
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

898
01:25:40,674 --> 01:25:43,510
You could tell me
where you were last night.

899
01:25:44,052 --> 01:25:47,306
I suppose I could,
but I don't really have to, now, do I?

900
01:25:50,392 --> 01:25:51,643
Come here.

901
01:25:52,978 --> 01:25:55,105
I wanna show you something.

902
01:26:06,366 --> 01:26:08,410
Looks like goodbye.

903
01:26:09,077 --> 01:26:10,871
Kelly's file.

904
01:26:11,079 --> 01:26:14,875
Read it. You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...

905
01:26:15,042 --> 01:26:17,544
...who threatened the lives
of at least two people.

906
01:26:17,753 --> 01:26:19,171
What two people?

907
01:26:19,338 --> 01:26:21,548
One of them was her mother.

908
01:26:21,757 --> 01:26:23,759
The other one was...

909
01:26:25,135 --> 01:26:26,678
...a female classmate...

910
01:26:28,263 --> 01:26:30,933
...she may have been
sexually involved with.

911
01:26:32,059 --> 01:26:33,560
Suzie?

912
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:37,231
Now you got the file.

913
01:26:37,731 --> 01:26:39,149
Read it.

914
01:26:39,983 --> 01:26:43,153
I think it'll give you a new
perspective on things.

915
01:26:44,279 --> 01:26:47,658
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?

916
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:52,496
Because then I had principles.

917
01:26:52,663 --> 01:26:54,498
That meant a lot to me.

918
01:26:56,542 --> 01:26:57,960
Now...

919
01:26:59,461 --> 01:27:01,380
...I don't care.

920
01:27:15,477 --> 01:27:17,729
I should probably go now.

921
01:27:20,357 --> 01:27:23,318
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.

922
01:27:50,804 --> 01:27:53,765
- Duquette. What's happening?
- I'm tired. I'm going home.

923
01:27:53,974 --> 01:27:55,434
- Where's Lombardo?
- He's gone.

924
01:27:55,642 --> 01:27:58,812
Goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.

925
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:01,064
Let me tell you something, Ray:

926
01:28:01,231 --> 01:28:03,275
There's more to this story
than you know.

927
01:28:03,442 --> 01:28:04,985
If Suzie is dead...

928
01:28:05,194 --> 01:28:07,613
...Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.

929
01:28:09,823 --> 01:28:11,325
Ray?

930
01:28:12,534 --> 01:28:14,953
Shit, Ray.

931
01:28:24,254 --> 01:28:27,382
- Who is it?
- It's Detective Duquette.

932
01:28:27,549 --> 01:28:29,426
Open the gate, now.

933
01:29:00,791 --> 01:29:02,960
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

934
01:29:21,270 --> 01:29:24,690
Where's...? Kelly! Kelly!

935
01:29:32,281 --> 01:29:36,034
I just looked away for a second,
just a split second.

936
01:29:36,326 --> 01:29:39,121
And just like that, bingo...

937
01:29:39,455 --> 01:29:41,665
...she put a knee in my groin.

938
01:29:41,832 --> 01:29:44,626
I didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...

939
01:29:45,127 --> 01:29:46,879
...just enough.

940
01:29:47,463 --> 01:29:49,465
I couldn't get to her.

941
01:29:50,299 --> 01:29:52,342
She turned on me with the gun.

942
01:29:54,470 --> 01:29:56,638
Fired one shot.

943
01:29:57,639 --> 01:29:59,266
I took the hit in the shoulder.

944
01:30:02,644 --> 01:30:04,605
I had no choice.

945
01:30:08,484 --> 01:30:09,776
I had to return fire.

946
01:30:11,528 --> 01:30:15,115
Two rounds, I think,
in the chest.

947
01:30:18,869 --> 01:30:21,121
I went there to protect her.

948
01:30:23,999 --> 01:30:26,543
I went... I went there to protect her.

949
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:28,462
Detective Duquette.

950
01:30:28,629 --> 01:30:32,132
I spent time in military intelligence,
and we had a saying there:

951
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:35,594
"Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

952
01:30:35,761 --> 01:30:37,846
Three times is enemy action."

953
01:30:38,013 --> 01:30:40,057
This is twice for you, Duquette...

954
01:30:40,224 --> 01:30:43,519
...and I intend to see to it
that there is no third time.

955
01:30:44,019 --> 01:30:47,856
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.

956
01:30:48,023 --> 01:30:50,776
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.

957
01:30:50,943 --> 01:30:53,821
Consequently,
two young women are dead.

958
01:30:54,404 --> 01:30:58,492
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.

959
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:00,327
Chief Goodsall...

960
01:31:00,494 --> 01:31:04,706
...Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...

961
01:31:04,873 --> 01:31:07,376
...near the area known as
Stoner Beach.

962
01:31:07,543 --> 01:31:10,754
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.

963
01:31:10,921 --> 01:31:13,924
This has led this office to conclude...

964
01:31:14,258 --> 01:31:17,719
...that Susan Marie Toller was
murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.

965
01:31:18,887 --> 01:31:21,223
She...
She didn't.

966
01:31:23,684 --> 01:31:25,352
Mr. Duquette.

967
01:31:25,853 --> 01:31:27,521
Mr. Duquette.

968
01:31:27,938 --> 01:31:31,567
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.

969
01:31:57,926 --> 01:31:59,678
Thank you, Paul.

970
01:32:54,441 --> 01:32:55,651
Howdy, partner.

971
01:32:57,569 --> 01:33:01,448
Jesus, man. I wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

972
01:33:05,160 --> 01:33:07,079
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.

973
01:33:07,246 --> 01:33:09,748
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.

974
01:33:09,915 --> 01:33:11,792
The bitch shot me.

975
01:33:12,000 --> 01:33:15,462
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?

976
01:33:15,671 --> 01:33:18,132
You know, shoot them
in the leg or something?

977
01:33:18,340 --> 01:33:21,635
Did you become squeamish
about this stuff before or after...

978
01:33:21,844 --> 01:33:25,055
...you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?

979
01:33:25,222 --> 01:33:28,684
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
It wasn't part of the plan.

980
01:33:28,851 --> 01:33:33,355
It couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.

981
01:33:33,522 --> 01:33:35,357
I couldn't talk them out of it.

982
01:33:35,524 --> 01:33:37,526
I'm telling you,
I don't like surprises.

983
01:33:37,734 --> 01:33:41,697
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.

984
01:33:41,864 --> 01:33:43,782
Now there's no loose ends.

985
01:33:43,949 --> 01:33:47,453
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.

986
01:33:47,619 --> 01:33:51,123
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...

987
01:33:51,540 --> 01:33:55,252
...I spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...

988
01:33:56,462 --> 01:33:58,255
...to make the transfer, so...

989
01:33:58,422 --> 01:33:59,965
- Bullshit.
- Oh, yeah.

990
01:34:00,132 --> 01:34:01,842
Call them yourself.

991
01:34:02,217 --> 01:34:06,346
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.

992
01:34:06,513 --> 01:34:10,517
We'll take out the boat.
I just had it outfitted.

993
01:34:11,101 --> 01:34:12,978
I could use a deck hand.

994
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:20,903
Here's to large bank accounts.

995
01:34:23,280 --> 01:34:26,784
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.

996
01:34:30,078 --> 01:34:33,248
To large accounts
and no loose ends.

997
01:34:34,166 --> 01:34:36,043
And no loose ends.

998
01:34:54,436 --> 01:34:57,314
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?

999
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:01,068
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.

1000
01:35:05,823 --> 01:35:07,491
- You mean that thing?
- Yeah, Ray.

1001
01:35:07,658 --> 01:35:11,787
We call it a winch.
It's what we use to tighten the sails.

1002
01:35:11,954 --> 01:35:16,083
- So why don't you start cranking?
- This is supposed to be a vacation.

1003
01:35:16,291 --> 01:35:18,252
Why don't you get a nice powerboat?

1004
01:35:18,961 --> 01:35:21,588
Come on, Ray.
I'll make a sailor out of you yet.

1005
01:35:22,548 --> 01:35:24,383
Or get me drowned.

1006
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:39,731
It's stuck.

1007
01:35:39,898 --> 01:35:43,110
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Put a little elbow grease in it.

1008
01:35:47,406 --> 01:35:48,991
It's stuck, I'm telling you.

1009
01:35:50,868 --> 01:35:53,120
The jenny sheet must be
caught on something.

1010
01:35:53,328 --> 01:35:56,582
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?

1011
01:35:56,748 --> 01:36:00,252
- I don't understand a word you said.
- Okay, Ray.

1012
01:36:00,419 --> 01:36:03,380
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...

1013
01:36:03,547 --> 01:36:06,175
...and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.

1014
01:36:07,968 --> 01:36:09,511
You're killing me.

1015
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:22,232
- You mean this thing?
- That's it. That one right there.

1016
01:36:22,649 --> 01:36:24,610
You see anything?

1017
01:36:27,571 --> 01:36:29,448
Look a little lower.

1018
01:36:29,698 --> 01:36:30,949
That's it.

1019
01:36:40,042 --> 01:36:42,544
Guess I forgot to tell you, Ray:

1020
01:36:44,254 --> 01:36:46,757
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.

1021
01:36:47,174 --> 01:36:49,301
First rule of sailing.

1022
01:37:14,576 --> 01:37:15,869
Ray!

1023
01:37:16,036 --> 01:37:18,664
- What happened?
- Nice try, motherfucker!

1024
01:37:27,798 --> 01:37:29,424
You!

1025
01:37:30,092 --> 01:37:32,052
You're dead!

1026
01:37:32,261 --> 01:37:33,762
No, I'm not.

1027
01:37:36,431 --> 01:37:37,850
Sam.

1028
01:37:38,016 --> 01:37:41,520
- Sam, for chrissake!
- Sorry, partner.

1029
01:37:41,687 --> 01:37:44,231
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.

1030
01:37:44,439 --> 01:37:47,776
You shouldn't have killed that kid
out in the glades either.

1031
01:37:47,943 --> 01:37:50,779
- What was his name?
- Davy.

1032
01:38:03,959 --> 01:38:05,586
That's my son, Walter.

1033
01:38:05,752 --> 01:38:10,841
He's been doing this a long time,
so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.

1034
01:38:11,008 --> 01:38:14,428
Thank you so much
for coming down to the glades.

1035
01:38:27,399 --> 01:38:32,279
Did you come here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?

1036
01:38:32,571 --> 01:38:34,740
No. Actually, it's my day off.

1037
01:38:36,575 --> 01:38:38,285
I thought you looked different.

1038
01:38:38,494 --> 01:38:41,038
I came because I was hoping
you would talk to me.

1039
01:38:42,581 --> 01:38:43,874
About Suzie?

1040
01:38:44,041 --> 01:38:47,795
Actually, I was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.

1041
01:38:53,258 --> 01:38:55,761
He used to come around here.

1042
01:38:56,637 --> 01:38:59,973
He had a thing going
with one of the girls...

1043
01:39:00,182 --> 01:39:03,727
Girls. Over at the glades.

1044
01:39:04,561 --> 01:39:08,148
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what I hear.

1045
01:39:08,899 --> 01:39:12,653
- She still work there?
- Not after that night.

1046
01:39:13,195 --> 01:39:15,364
All I know is, the next morning...

1047
01:39:15,531 --> 01:39:19,493
...she was gone and a boy was dead.

1048
01:39:19,660 --> 01:39:25,082
Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.

1049
01:39:28,460 --> 01:39:32,714
Caught Ray slapping her around,
and he tried to stop it.

1050
01:39:33,715 --> 01:39:36,593
So Ray killed him.

1051
01:39:37,386 --> 01:39:39,596
Suzie saw it.

1052
01:39:39,930 --> 01:39:43,809
So he busted her and sent her up.

1053
01:39:43,976 --> 01:39:48,647
You know, just to prove that he could.

1054
01:39:49,398 --> 01:39:52,442
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.

1055
01:40:03,579 --> 01:40:05,581
To Ray.

1056
01:40:05,914 --> 01:40:09,543
We won. Sam, it's over.

1057
01:40:17,050 --> 01:40:21,388
Wow. Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.

1058
01:40:21,555 --> 01:40:25,726
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before I can get rid of you.

1059
01:40:37,404 --> 01:40:38,780
Okay, Toller.

1060
01:40:38,947 --> 01:40:41,700
I wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.

1061
01:40:42,618 --> 01:40:46,455
- Fuck the winch. I wanna drive.
- It doesn't work that way.

1062
01:40:46,622 --> 01:40:48,749
You don't drive it, you sail it.

1063
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,960
Now, get on that winch.

1064
01:40:53,128 --> 01:40:56,006
I just wanna cruise for a while.

1065
01:40:59,635 --> 01:41:04,223
That's funny. That's one of the first
things I noticed about you, Sam.

1066
01:41:04,389 --> 01:41:07,267
You like to cruise.

1067
01:41:08,936 --> 01:41:12,773
- Suzie.
- Take college, for instance.

1068
01:41:12,981 --> 01:41:17,945
I bet the classes you took were ones
where the finals were multiple choice.

1069
01:41:18,737 --> 01:41:22,407
And you never bought the book.
You'd find a girl to loan you hers.

1070
01:41:22,574 --> 01:41:26,286
And then, of course, you'd have
to fuck her after that, right?

1071
01:41:26,495 --> 01:41:27,955
Is that how it went?

1072
01:41:30,958 --> 01:41:32,417
Yeah.

1073
01:41:34,795 --> 01:41:37,631
Well, I've got a good pop quiz for you.

1074
01:41:37,798 --> 01:41:39,883
Multiple choice, of course.

1075
01:41:41,218 --> 01:41:42,886
Before sailing on the Helios...

1076
01:41:43,053 --> 01:41:48,642
...Medea killed King Creon
and the princess with what?

1077
01:41:49,143 --> 01:41:50,769
A rock?

1078
01:41:51,687 --> 01:41:53,397
A spear gun?

1079
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:56,984
Or a little poison?

1080
01:41:57,860 --> 01:41:59,987
Poison!

1081
01:42:03,782 --> 01:42:05,325
Good guess.

1082
01:42:19,506 --> 01:42:21,216
Van Ryan got old.

1083
01:42:21,842 --> 01:42:24,344
He and his cronies would come here.

1084
01:42:24,553 --> 01:42:28,640
Hunt and whore.
They acted like a bunch of assholes.

1085
01:42:29,016 --> 01:42:31,602
One trip, he showed up with this girl...

1086
01:42:31,768 --> 01:42:35,022
...he'd picked up somewhere.

1087
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:37,316
Gotten her pregnant.

1088
01:42:38,358 --> 01:42:40,694
Dumped her in the swamp.

1089
01:42:41,028 --> 01:42:42,988
Poor girl was dead in a year.

1090
01:42:46,408 --> 01:42:50,245
That came with her.

1091
01:42:50,871 --> 01:42:52,623
And the child?

1092
01:42:52,790 --> 01:42:56,418
Well, she had it.
Before she drank herself to death.

1093
01:42:57,961 --> 01:43:00,964
Wasn't exactly a love child.

1094
01:43:12,100 --> 01:43:14,645
So you're not her grandmother.

1095
01:43:15,771 --> 01:43:18,816
I raised her like I was.

1096
01:43:19,358 --> 01:43:23,570
But, no. Walt was my only child.
He was a good boy.

1097
01:43:23,779 --> 01:43:25,906
Until the Army took him.

1098
01:43:26,114 --> 01:43:29,660
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan
were half sisters.

1099
01:43:30,202 --> 01:43:34,581
And the other girl, Kelly?
Suzie's niece.

1100
01:43:45,300 --> 01:43:49,304
Well, it may be good news or not.
I don't know. We'll start with the letter.

1101
01:43:49,471 --> 01:43:52,975
- H.
- Yes, there are two H's.

1102
01:44:16,373 --> 01:44:18,250
Nice truck.

1103
01:44:26,216 --> 01:44:27,968
Selling your boat?

1104
01:44:33,056 --> 01:44:35,350
This was Suzie's boat.

1105
01:44:36,018 --> 01:44:38,520
Guess she won't be needing it now.

1106
01:44:40,355 --> 01:44:44,401
Funny. I wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.

1107
01:44:46,778 --> 01:44:50,949
Old lady had her tested once.
They said her IQ was way up there.

1108
01:44:51,116 --> 01:44:54,995
Around 200 or some such shit.

1109
01:44:55,162 --> 01:44:58,624
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.

1110
01:46:10,362 --> 01:46:12,072
Hi.

1111
01:46:12,781 --> 01:46:14,616
What are you doing out here?

1112
01:46:15,576 --> 01:46:17,828
I'm running away.

1113
01:46:18,620 --> 01:46:20,789
You think that's wise?

1114
01:46:23,625 --> 01:46:25,961
Guess what else?

1115
01:46:29,006 --> 01:46:30,966
I have toys.

1116
01:46:36,013 --> 01:46:38,140
I suppose one taste won't hurt.

1117
01:46:49,651 --> 01:46:51,153
You know...

1118
01:46:51,320 --> 01:46:54,823
...that weekend I got busted,
I called you about a hundred times.

1119
01:46:59,495 --> 01:47:03,457
I really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.

1120
01:47:05,793 --> 01:47:07,085
Was I naive.

1121
01:47:11,590 --> 01:47:13,634
I can't decide what came out better.

1122
01:47:13,842 --> 01:47:19,181
That little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dildo shoved up her ass.

1123
01:47:20,349 --> 01:47:22,851
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

1124
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:39,618
Seems to like the same places you do.

1125
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:44,706
- Funny you never met.
- Yeah, real funny.

1126
01:47:44,873 --> 01:47:49,336
You know, you're wrong about this,
and I could get busted on the spot.

1127
01:47:50,337 --> 01:47:55,008
Trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it.
Especially the part about killing me.

1128
01:47:55,175 --> 01:47:58,637
Now, get out of here.
Go make yourself a new friend.

1129
01:48:10,899 --> 01:48:13,026
What are you drinking?

1130
01:48:17,114 --> 01:48:19,867
We gotta stop. I'm gonna come.

1131
01:48:21,910 --> 01:48:25,164
That never seemed
to worry you at the glades.

1132
01:48:26,748 --> 01:48:31,879
- That's not your line...
- Say you love me.

1133
01:48:33,464 --> 01:48:37,551
I love you.
Now, give me the line.

1134
01:48:37,759 --> 01:48:41,346
No little girl can ever make me come.

1135
01:48:54,943 --> 01:48:59,031
You got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the evidence.

1136
01:49:03,577 --> 01:49:06,246
Oh, for chrissake.

1137
01:49:21,303 --> 01:49:23,680
- Hello, Kelly.
- What are you doing here?

1138
01:50:10,811 --> 01:50:12,688
May I ask you a question, Ms. Toller?

1139
01:50:15,232 --> 01:50:18,402
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?

1140
01:50:21,113 --> 01:50:22,990
I hope I never make you mad.

1141
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:29,580
Cash is just walking-around money.

1142
01:50:30,205 --> 01:50:32,416
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...

1143
01:50:32,583 --> 01:50:35,043
...minus the million we set aside
for Ruby and Walter...

1144
01:50:35,210 --> 01:50:36,879
...less my usual fee.

1145
01:50:38,797 --> 01:50:40,466
Case closed.

1146
01:50:52,644 --> 01:50:54,438
Suzie.

1147
01:50:57,065 --> 01:50:59,067
Be good.
