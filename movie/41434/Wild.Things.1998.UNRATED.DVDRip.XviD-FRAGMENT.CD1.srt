1
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,926
Forget it, loser.

2
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:00,346
Oh, Mr. Lombardo.

3
00:04:00,596 --> 00:04:02,222
- Hey.
- Hey, bro.

4
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,725
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

5
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:07,686
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

6
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:09,646
Jennifer...

7
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:23,285
Did you see his eyes?

8
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,513
What are you looking at, dork?

9
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,308
Fuck off.

10
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:49,061
I appreciate you guys coming down.

11
00:04:50,646 --> 00:04:53,399
The only thing I'm gonna miss
in this dump is...

12
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:56,360
Settle down.

13
00:04:57,277 --> 00:04:58,946
Settle down.

14
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:04,576
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

15
00:05:07,246 --> 00:05:09,581
Settle down.
Settle down.

16
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:13,002
- Beats study hall, doesn't it?
- No!

17
00:05:13,335 --> 00:05:18,090
- That you, Jimmy?
- At least in study hall I can meditate.

18
00:05:18,298 --> 00:05:20,426
What he means is, "masturbate."

19
00:05:21,093 --> 00:05:25,264
Something with which I'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.

20
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:53,625
It wasn't me, man.
It wasn't me.

21
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,878
I'm innocent.
I'm innocent.

22
00:05:56,045 --> 00:06:01,008
We've all heard the terms
"date rape," "sexual harassment."

23
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,763
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.

24
00:06:06,513 --> 00:06:10,309
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

25
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:14,438
Detectives Duquette and Perez...

26
00:06:14,605 --> 00:06:16,482
...are here to give us
what we hope...

27
00:06:16,648 --> 00:06:19,026
...will be a fresh perspective
on the subject...

28
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:22,655
...and to address any questions
that any of you might have.

29
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:25,366
Now, let's give them
a warm welcome.

30
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:30,371
- Thank you.
- I'm out of here.

31
00:06:30,537 --> 00:06:34,208
- Why don't we begin with a question.
- This prick can kiss my ass.

32
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:45,010
As I was saying...

33
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:47,805
...why don't we begin
with a question.

34
00:06:47,971 --> 00:06:52,017
- What is a sex crime?
- Not getting any.

35
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:02,820
What's with that?
She's the one who walked out.

36
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:06,740
- Suzie Toller.
- I busted her last year for possession.

37
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:08,909
Poor kid did six months
in Camp Nine.

38
00:07:09,076 --> 00:07:12,121
- Six months? First offense?
- I didn't hand down the sentence.

39
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,998
She was dirty.
I busted her.

40
00:07:14,164 --> 00:07:15,374
Hey, Carol.

41
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:17,876
I appreciate you guys
taking the time to come.

42
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:19,253
Our pleasure.

43
00:07:24,717 --> 00:07:27,886
Why do I get the feeling you don't
like the guidance counselor?

44
00:07:28,053 --> 00:07:31,473
Don't tell me you can't see through
his routine. He's a total hound.

45
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,726
You mean pussy hound?

46
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,106
Actually, I thought
he was kind of cute.

47
00:07:39,356 --> 00:07:40,858
I'd do him.

48
00:08:10,804 --> 00:08:12,556
Steady.

49
00:08:17,311 --> 00:08:19,521
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

50
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:22,900
That's good.

51
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:32,368
Drop the main.

52
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:36,789
All right, guys, let's de-rig
and I'll see you all Monday.

53
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:47,091
Hey, ladies, my car needs a wash.

54
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:48,842
Do you do windows?

55
00:08:49,009 --> 00:08:51,804
Good work, guys.
A.C., see you Monday.

56
00:08:52,012 --> 00:08:54,264
- See you, Mr. Lombardo.
- All right, buddy.

57
00:09:05,567 --> 00:09:07,027
All right.

58
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:09,279
I could definitely party
on one of those.

59
00:09:12,324 --> 00:09:14,201
It's a stinkpot, Jimmy.

60
00:09:14,368 --> 00:09:18,455
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.

61
00:09:20,457 --> 00:09:22,126
Yeah.

62
00:09:22,292 --> 00:09:24,211
That's a real boat.

63
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:28,173
Thank you for getting me
into this class.

64
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,968
No way my old man was gonna
spring for the fees.

65
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,180
Hey, you're working for it, and you're
learning your way around a boat.

66
00:09:35,347 --> 00:09:37,641
I put myself through college
working on boats.

67
00:09:37,808 --> 00:09:39,893
- Beats flipping burgers.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:45,024
Can I play too, or is it just for boys?

69
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:50,738
So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?

70
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:55,034
The senior car wash, remember?

71
00:09:55,409 --> 00:09:57,870
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.

72
00:09:58,078 --> 00:10:00,497
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and I do it?

73
00:10:00,664 --> 00:10:02,458
We're working as a team.

74
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:06,045
I tell you what. I'm going out
to the glades Saturday.

75
00:10:06,211 --> 00:10:09,173
Why don't you come over Sunday
and wash all the mud off.

76
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,924
Deal.

77
00:10:11,592 --> 00:10:14,887
I was counting on my mom
to give me a ride, but she's not here.

78
00:10:15,054 --> 00:10:16,513
Surprise, surprise.

79
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,433
So I was wondering
if you could give me one.

80
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:24,521
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?

81
00:10:24,688 --> 00:10:27,107
I mean, like,
something bad might happen.

82
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,280
- What about you, you need a lift?
- Yeah, but I got my bike.

83
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:35,407
Hey, no problem.

84
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,837
Okay, try it.

85
00:10:53,634 --> 00:10:57,137
Suzie, you need a lift?
We got room for one more.

86
00:10:57,304 --> 00:11:01,308
Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes,
"Whores 4 Less"?

87
00:11:04,186 --> 00:11:06,021
Try it again.

88
00:11:11,652 --> 00:11:14,321
Nice to see you kids getting along.

89
00:11:56,488 --> 00:11:59,700
- Don't forget Sunday.
- I won't.

90
00:12:02,703 --> 00:12:05,873
- Is that Sam Lombardo?
- Hi, Mom.

91
00:12:06,206 --> 00:12:08,000
Sam, hi.

92
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,627
Hi, Sandra.

93
00:12:12,212 --> 00:12:16,133
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.

94
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,801
Sorry, Sandra, I gotta run.

95
00:13:33,544 --> 00:13:35,963
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
- Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

96
00:13:37,172 --> 00:13:39,133
Hi, girls.

97
00:13:39,591 --> 00:13:41,468
Look. He forgot.

98
00:13:41,635 --> 00:13:43,804
- I knew it.
- No, I didn't.

99
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:46,974
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.

100
00:13:47,307 --> 00:13:50,102
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.

101
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:53,439
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?

102
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:57,943
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

103
00:13:58,110 --> 00:13:59,695
Sam, I'm leaving.

104
00:13:59,862 --> 00:14:02,448
So where's your hose,
Mr. Lombardo?

105
00:14:04,491 --> 00:14:07,494
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.

106
00:14:12,374 --> 00:14:15,169
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?

107
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:18,088
Come on, Barbara.
It's for a good cause.

108
00:14:21,133 --> 00:14:22,968
Sam the philanthropist.

109
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:26,805
Yeah, well, you know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.

110
00:14:27,014 --> 00:14:28,724
Okay.

111
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:33,312
- Have fun at the club.
- Okay.

112
00:15:33,956 --> 00:15:35,499
Wow.

113
00:15:36,667 --> 00:15:38,585
Looks brand-new.

114
00:15:41,422 --> 00:15:43,424
Aren't you forgetting something?

115
00:15:44,299 --> 00:15:47,052
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.

116
00:15:47,219 --> 00:15:49,013
Oh, yeah, that thing.

117
00:15:49,388 --> 00:15:53,225
- Can't we just...?
- Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

118
00:15:54,059 --> 00:15:55,686
Okay, let me look for it.

119
00:15:55,853 --> 00:15:59,106
Mr. Lombardo,
we're running kind of late.

120
00:15:59,398 --> 00:16:01,567
How about if Nicole goes on
to the Mansons'?

121
00:16:01,734 --> 00:16:03,610
You can give me a ride
when you find it.

122
00:16:03,902 --> 00:16:08,115
No, no, just give me a minute. Okay?

123
00:16:13,871 --> 00:16:16,915
- Go.
- Are you sure?

124
00:17:30,531 --> 00:17:32,658
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, God.

125
00:17:32,825 --> 00:17:37,037
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

126
00:17:38,038 --> 00:17:40,499
Goddamn it!

127
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:44,086
- Hello, this is Blue Bay High School.
- Hello.

128
00:17:44,253 --> 00:17:46,588
Your son or daughter
was absent today, Monday...

129
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,841
Jesus H. Christ!

130
00:17:50,342 --> 00:17:52,803
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

131
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,179
Come on.

132
00:17:57,016 --> 00:18:00,477
- Art, this is a hell of a fish you caught.
- It's a barracuda.

133
00:18:00,894 --> 00:18:03,272
If you weren't so busy
chasing booty...

134
00:18:03,439 --> 00:18:06,525
...you'd have come with me
and caught one for yourself.

135
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:09,111
Don't tell me you're gonna
eat this thing.

136
00:18:09,278 --> 00:18:10,529
Why not?

137
00:18:10,738 --> 00:18:13,324
It's a barracuda. It's poisonous.
It'll kill you.

138
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:17,036
Shit, man, I could say that
about most of the girls you date.

139
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:19,330
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

140
00:18:27,338 --> 00:18:30,007
- Sandra, what's up?
- Kelly skipped school today, Sam.

141
00:18:31,175 --> 00:18:32,718
Have you heard anything?

142
00:18:33,135 --> 00:18:34,386
Not a word.

143
00:18:35,554 --> 00:18:37,556
Never mind.

144
00:18:37,931 --> 00:18:40,184
I found her.

145
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,730
Pull!

146
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:49,068
Listen, Sam, it was really good
seeing you the other day.

147
00:18:49,652 --> 00:18:51,612
Sandra, I'm real busy right now, so...

148
00:18:52,821 --> 00:18:56,700
I haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

149
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:01,580
- Yeah, well...
- I know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.

150
00:19:01,955 --> 00:19:06,502
- So what?
- So maybe I'm a one-woman man now.

151
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:10,214
Aw, poor Sam.

152
00:19:10,381 --> 00:19:13,717
Really think you'll get one of these
Blue Bay women to marry you?

153
00:19:14,051 --> 00:19:17,179
- Are you finished, Sandra?
- Grab a clue, honey.

154
00:19:17,346 --> 00:19:20,516
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.

155
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:22,935
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

156
00:19:23,143 --> 00:19:25,062
Goodbye, Sandra.

157
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,440
Pull!

158
00:19:30,818 --> 00:19:34,071
You seem to find guns therapeutic.

159
00:19:35,823 --> 00:19:37,324
Maybe I ought to try it.

160
00:19:39,493 --> 00:19:40,953
So let me guess.

161
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,956
Some boy didn't call and screwed up
your whole weekend.

162
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:47,292
So you're taking the day off. Right?

163
00:19:50,838 --> 00:19:53,132
Which one of your deck hands
is that?

164
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:55,551
Whichever one I want.

165
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,724
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

166
00:20:05,185 --> 00:20:06,687
What is it?

167
00:20:08,188 --> 00:20:10,190
I miss Dad.

168
00:20:10,983 --> 00:20:12,776
Jesus.

169
00:20:14,737 --> 00:20:17,990
I miss him too, sometimes.

170
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,491
No, you don't.

171
00:20:19,658 --> 00:20:22,328
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

172
00:20:24,663 --> 00:20:26,582
Oh, Kelly...

173
00:20:34,381 --> 00:20:36,759
I don't know why he did it.

174
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:41,847
I really don't.

175
00:20:46,935 --> 00:20:48,562
Can l...?

176
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,026
Can I get you anything?

177
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:56,320
Do you want a Valium?

178
00:21:00,449 --> 00:21:02,785
I was raped.

179
00:21:04,078 --> 00:21:08,415
- What, honey? I can't hear you.
- I said, I was raped.

180
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:10,292
What?

181
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,589
I was raped...

182
00:21:16,924 --> 00:21:19,426
...by Sam Lombardo.

183
00:21:21,428 --> 00:21:23,347
Sam Lombardo?

184
00:21:25,015 --> 00:21:28,394
My daughter does not
get raped in Blue Bay!

185
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:31,188
And you're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?

186
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:35,234
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

187
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,779
We understand your feelings,
Miss Van Ryan...

188
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:42,032
...but please,
we need some time with Kelly.

189
00:21:42,282 --> 00:21:44,368
We'd like to take her statement alone.

190
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,041
- Are you all right with this, baby?
- Yeah.

191
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,710
Okay.

192
00:22:02,928 --> 00:22:05,472
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

193
00:22:06,807 --> 00:22:08,308
I just wanna get it over with.

194
00:22:10,185 --> 00:22:12,229
We'd like to videotape this statement.

195
00:22:12,396 --> 00:22:15,816
I know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...

196
00:22:15,983 --> 00:22:20,529
...and we need to know everything that
happened between the two of you.

197
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:22,489
Are you ready?

198
00:22:32,207 --> 00:22:35,252
He started rubbing my shoulders.

199
00:22:37,963 --> 00:22:39,381
I let him.

200
00:22:39,548 --> 00:22:42,092
I mean, he's a nice guy.

201
00:22:43,594 --> 00:22:45,471
The next thing...

202
00:22:46,263 --> 00:22:49,558
...his hand was in my shorts.

203
00:22:50,893 --> 00:22:52,853
You know, from behind.

204
00:22:55,022 --> 00:22:57,983
His fingers...

205
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,113
- His fingers...
- Take your time.

206
00:23:06,867 --> 00:23:08,786
They were in me.

207
00:23:09,036 --> 00:23:10,829
Both places, you know?

208
00:23:12,873 --> 00:23:15,501
Did he put himself inside you?

209
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:18,212
Yes.

210
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:21,048
I said "Stop."
I screamed.

211
00:23:21,215 --> 00:23:24,259
I mean, that's how it
sounded in my head.

212
00:23:25,969 --> 00:23:27,680
He hurt me.

213
00:23:28,347 --> 00:23:30,307
Did you try to fight him?

214
00:23:33,018 --> 00:23:35,854
Well, he had my wrists
pinned behind me.

215
00:23:36,021 --> 00:23:37,398
Then what?

216
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:40,818
He kept saying, "Let it happen.

217
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:43,070
Let it happen."

218
00:23:44,863 --> 00:23:47,074
And then he just stopped.

219
00:23:47,408 --> 00:23:49,451
You mean he withdrew?

220
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:52,997
I don't know. It's really hard
to remember, exactly.

221
00:23:53,747 --> 00:23:55,374
Try, Kelly.

222
00:24:00,754 --> 00:24:02,756
I know one thing he said.

223
00:24:03,882 --> 00:24:07,928
He said, "Don't worry.
I didn't come."

224
00:24:08,387 --> 00:24:10,389
I can't forget that.

225
00:24:11,807 --> 00:24:15,978
He said, "No little girl
can ever make me come."

226
00:24:19,773 --> 00:24:23,277
"No little girl can ever
make me come." Jesus.

227
00:24:23,444 --> 00:24:26,530
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.

228
00:24:28,782 --> 00:24:30,034
What?

229
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:34,038
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

230
00:24:35,664 --> 00:24:38,792
You want my gut? There it is.
I think she's acting.

231
00:24:38,959 --> 00:24:42,296
I think she set it up to be alone
with him so he'd come on to her.

232
00:24:42,463 --> 00:24:44,131
She's upset because he didn't.

233
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:47,009
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.

234
00:24:47,176 --> 00:24:50,054
The guy never should've had her
there in the first place.

235
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,265
The line I have on him,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

236
00:24:53,474 --> 00:24:55,684
That doesn't make him a rapist.

237
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:58,145
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?

238
00:24:58,312 --> 00:25:00,647
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?

239
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:02,274
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.

240
00:25:02,441 --> 00:25:07,112
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector
test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

241
00:25:07,321 --> 00:25:10,491
You afraid of Tom Baxter now?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

242
00:25:10,658 --> 00:25:13,786
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.

243
00:25:13,952 --> 00:25:17,122
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.

244
00:25:17,289 --> 00:25:20,042
- You know what that'll mean for him.
- Yeah.

245
00:25:20,209 --> 00:25:25,422
And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.

246
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:19,351
All right.

247
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,395
Good work, Jimbo.
I'll see you Monday.

248
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:22,896
All right.

249
00:26:29,778 --> 00:26:32,406
That's what's left of my sailing class.

250
00:26:35,909 --> 00:26:37,745
Talk to me, Artie.

251
00:26:38,912 --> 00:26:42,082
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.

252
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:44,877
Jimmy told me.

253
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,713
Apparently, I'm the last one
to know about it.

254
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,840
Sam, I...

255
00:26:50,758 --> 00:26:53,135
Sandra Van Ryan has been
on the horn all day...

256
00:26:53,302 --> 00:26:55,387
...with every member
of the school board.

257
00:26:55,596 --> 00:26:57,056
She's pushing for suspension.

258
00:26:57,222 --> 00:27:01,060
And the board's just gonna roll over
for her without hearing my side?

259
00:27:01,226 --> 00:27:05,022
This is insane.
I'm innocent, goddamn it.

260
00:27:05,189 --> 00:27:06,648
You gotta believe that.

261
00:27:06,815 --> 00:27:09,068
All I can tell you, Sam,
is hang in there.

262
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:11,195
They clear you, you get reinstated...

263
00:27:11,403 --> 00:27:14,073
You never get clear
of something like this.

264
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:17,201
It stays with you.

265
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:20,788
It follows you around forever.

266
00:27:21,997 --> 00:27:23,749
You're gonna need some help, Sam.

267
00:27:24,792 --> 00:27:26,919
You're gonna need an attorney.

268
00:27:27,086 --> 00:27:30,422
Right. And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...

269
00:27:30,631 --> 00:27:33,592
...is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.

270
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:54,113
I'm here to see Ken Bowden.

271
00:27:54,279 --> 00:27:58,325
- Do you have an appointment?
- Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.

272
00:27:58,492 --> 00:28:00,619
Okay, then.

273
00:28:00,828 --> 00:28:03,330
Mr. Bowden,
your 10:30's here.

274
00:28:03,497 --> 00:28:05,499
Will you show him in, please?

275
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,337
What brings you
to this part of town?

276
00:28:11,338 --> 00:28:13,465
Well, I was, until yesterday...

277
00:28:13,632 --> 00:28:16,593
...a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.

278
00:28:18,512 --> 00:28:20,556
A student there
is accusing me of rape.

279
00:28:22,266 --> 00:28:23,600
Male or female?

280
00:28:25,019 --> 00:28:27,813
- The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
- As in Sandra Van Ryan?

281
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,441
As in, I'm fucked.

282
00:28:33,068 --> 00:28:34,653
Why don't you tell me about it?

283
00:28:36,739 --> 00:28:38,866
- Shit, where do I begin?
- Start with...

284
00:28:40,326 --> 00:28:43,037
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.

285
00:28:44,121 --> 00:28:48,542
She's a student. I was her counselor.
Beyond that, there's no relationship.

286
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:51,128
You got nothing to worry about.

287
00:28:55,007 --> 00:28:57,468
- What did you do to your neck?
- This?

288
00:28:58,093 --> 00:29:00,262
I don't have to wear it all the time.

289
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:06,977
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.

290
00:29:09,188 --> 00:29:12,149
All right, let me tell you
how I charge.

291
00:29:20,324 --> 00:29:22,284
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?

292
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:25,120
Mr. Lombardo, I'm afraid
I can't park your car today.

293
00:29:25,287 --> 00:29:28,874
You can't park me?
I'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

294
00:29:34,254 --> 00:29:37,341
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.

295
00:29:37,508 --> 00:29:39,510
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

296
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:44,431
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

297
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:52,481
Barbara, let's go.

298
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,196
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.

299
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:01,865
You're finished in Blue Bay.

300
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:07,705
I find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

301
00:30:08,497 --> 00:30:12,251
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Mr. Lombardo, please.

302
00:30:17,506 --> 00:30:19,341
That's all right, George.

303
00:30:42,781 --> 00:30:46,285
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.

304
00:30:46,493 --> 00:30:49,705
- Welcome back.
- Rum and Coke.

305
00:32:20,087 --> 00:32:22,214
Hey! Are you all right?

306
00:32:22,756 --> 00:32:24,800
- I'm fine.
- Cool?

307
00:32:24,967 --> 00:32:27,136
That's too bad, motherfucker.

308
00:32:40,524 --> 00:32:42,359
Sam?

309
00:32:47,531 --> 00:32:49,408
Lombardo?

310
00:33:10,429 --> 00:33:13,307
Whoa, man! It's me.

311
00:33:14,725 --> 00:33:18,020
Sorry, man. Things have been
getting a little weird around here.

312
00:33:18,187 --> 00:33:20,105
I can see that.

313
00:33:21,607 --> 00:33:23,525
Come on in.

314
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:30,741
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy that did this to you?

315
00:33:31,659 --> 00:33:32,993
It was him, all right.

316
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,746
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

317
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:39,375
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

318
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:42,795
- Forget it.
- The lady has deep pockets.

319
00:33:42,961 --> 00:33:45,673
Believe me, I know how deep
her pockets are.

320
00:33:45,839 --> 00:33:50,302
I thought I might be able to save
my house. Some sort of equity loan.

321
00:33:50,678 --> 00:33:54,181
Guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

322
00:33:54,598 --> 00:33:57,518
I don't need any more trouble
from this woman.

323
00:33:57,685 --> 00:34:00,813
You think making some sort
of statement's gonna stop her?

324
00:34:01,188 --> 00:34:04,149
With the shit I got on Kelly?
Yeah.

325
00:34:05,275 --> 00:34:06,777
A year ago...

326
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:09,613
...when her old man
blew his brains out...

327
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,991
...Kelly lost it, ran away.

328
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:16,370
They found her in a fleabag motel
some place, coked out of her gourd.

329
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,123
Meanwhile...

330
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:22,668
...you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...

331
00:34:22,876 --> 00:34:24,128
...or some crap.

332
00:34:24,503 --> 00:34:26,964
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...

333
00:34:27,339 --> 00:34:30,300
...they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.

334
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:33,220
Why do you think they haven't
taken your statement yet?

335
00:34:34,013 --> 00:34:36,015
Because they're busy
looking for dirt.

336
00:34:36,223 --> 00:34:37,975
And they're not gonna find it.

337
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:43,230
Right?

338
00:34:44,565 --> 00:34:47,693
Ken, I don't fuck my students.

339
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,023
He's just showing off
for you now.

340
00:35:28,233 --> 00:35:30,361
Hey there, Ruby.

341
00:35:30,611 --> 00:35:32,821
I see you still got Walter.

342
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:35,741
I was hoping something
had eaten him by now.

343
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:41,080
- Can I help you with something?
- Suzie called us.

344
00:35:41,288 --> 00:35:43,332
Where would we find her?

345
00:35:44,583 --> 00:35:46,460
You know the way.

346
00:35:52,841 --> 00:35:55,594
You won't shoot her, will you?

347
00:35:57,930 --> 00:36:00,599
I don't believe she's armed.

348
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:38,095
Yeah?

349
00:36:42,808 --> 00:36:44,560
Jesus, it took you guys
long enough.

350
00:36:44,727 --> 00:36:49,523
What if someone was trying to
strangle me or fuck me in the ass?

351
00:36:51,775 --> 00:36:53,777
I mean,
you guys do sex crimes, right?

352
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,905
My partner, Detective Perez.

353
00:37:02,911 --> 00:37:07,207
It's Céline. He's okay. He had a good
line on what cheap fucks people are.

354
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:10,169
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us.
Remember?

355
00:37:18,218 --> 00:37:20,679
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

356
00:37:22,264 --> 00:37:23,974
No.

357
00:37:24,975 --> 00:37:27,978
- Will they?
- I don't know.

358
00:37:28,562 --> 00:37:30,022
That bothers you?

359
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,402
I wanna go outside.

360
00:37:42,409 --> 00:37:45,537
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?

361
00:37:45,704 --> 00:37:47,665
About a year ago.

362
00:37:47,873 --> 00:37:51,043
And when you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?

363
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:53,796
- Nope.
- So you were alone.

364
00:37:53,962 --> 00:37:55,631
Yeah.

365
00:37:55,798 --> 00:37:57,633
Did he come in with you?

366
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,388
- I guess.
- You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?

367
00:38:02,596 --> 00:38:05,516
Okay. Yeah, he did.

368
00:38:05,683 --> 00:38:07,267
And then what? Did he touch you?

369
00:38:07,434 --> 00:38:10,396
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?

370
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:13,941
Suzie, look, I know you feel bad.

371
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:18,570
- Just tell us the truth.
- I didn't say a thing to him.

372
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:23,409
He just put his arm around me
and told me I was pretty.

373
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,704
I could be really pretty, he said.

374
00:38:27,413 --> 00:38:29,081
Did you ask him to stop?

375
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:31,792
Shit.

376
00:38:32,251 --> 00:38:35,045
What difference does it make?
No one believes me anyway.

377
00:38:35,212 --> 00:38:38,424
- Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
- Yeah. Okay? He did.

378
00:38:38,632 --> 00:38:40,926
He pushed me to the floor
and he did it to me.

379
00:38:43,178 --> 00:38:45,931
- Now are we done?
- Almost, Suzie.

380
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,891
Almost.

381
00:38:48,976 --> 00:38:51,603
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?

382
00:38:52,646 --> 00:38:56,108
No. He stopped by himself.

383
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:59,778
Okay? Is that it?
Leave me alone.

384
00:39:00,321 --> 00:39:03,782
- Don't touch me!
- All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

385
00:39:03,949 --> 00:39:05,743
He stopped.

386
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:09,121
And that was it? He just left?

387
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,498
Yeah.

388
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:15,336
He did say one thing first.

389
00:39:15,627 --> 00:39:17,087
What was that?

390
00:39:17,838 --> 00:39:21,842
He said, "No little bitch
can ever make me come."

391
00:39:24,845 --> 00:39:26,680
Open the gate.

392
00:39:32,144 --> 00:39:35,481
- Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
- Hello, Jinxy.

393
00:39:38,776 --> 00:39:42,029
You know, it's really a
bad news, good news situation.

394
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:46,909
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...

395
00:39:47,076 --> 00:39:49,119
...instead of a public defender.

396
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,498
I'm telling you, Ken, I'm innocent.

397
00:39:53,374 --> 00:39:57,169
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

398
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:06,679
So you're the new
chicken licker.

399
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,564
Sandra, can we get your comment?

400
00:40:17,731 --> 00:40:19,858
Can I just have your feelings
at this time?

401
00:40:20,067 --> 00:40:22,528
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.

402
00:40:23,237 --> 00:40:24,822
Can you tell us anything?

403
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,324
- Are you confident about the case?
- Very. Yes.

404
00:40:27,491 --> 00:40:30,369
The Lombardo rape case
has galvanized the upscale town...

405
00:40:30,536 --> 00:40:32,496
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.

406
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:34,581
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...

407
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:38,627
...jet-set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

408
00:40:38,794 --> 00:40:42,464
And the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. In the end, the jury...

409
00:40:42,631 --> 00:40:45,509
...must choose between the words
of these 18-year-old girls...

410
00:40:45,676 --> 00:40:47,261
...and that of Sam Lombardo.

411
00:40:47,428 --> 00:40:50,097
Reporting from the courthouse steps,
I'm Nancy Duerr.

412
00:40:50,264 --> 00:40:51,932
Eyewitness News.

413
00:41:31,722 --> 00:41:34,141
The State of Florida
v. Sam Lombardo.

414
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:38,228
The Honorable Sylvia B. Waxman
presiding. All rise.

415
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,439
We gotta stand up.

416
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:45,569
Please be seated.

417
00:41:45,778 --> 00:41:47,446
Now sit down.

418
00:42:01,418 --> 00:42:03,253
Would you like more time, Kelly?

419
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:11,970
I know that this is hard, Kelly...

420
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,140
...but I have one more question.

421
00:42:15,307 --> 00:42:18,143
And even though it's something
we've been over...

422
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:21,563
...I want us all
to be very clear about it.

423
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:26,485
Kelly, when you saw
that Mr. Lombardo...

424
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:29,863
...intended to have sex with you...

425
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,157
...what were your exact words?

426
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:34,660
What did you say?

427
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:38,288
I told him "No."

428
00:42:39,456 --> 00:42:42,126
I said,
"Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please."

429
00:42:44,712 --> 00:42:47,715
I screamed for him to stop.

430
00:42:48,298 --> 00:42:50,175
You screamed for him...

431
00:42:50,926 --> 00:42:52,720
...to stop.

432
00:42:53,887 --> 00:42:55,681
And did he?

433
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,851
No.

434
00:42:59,727 --> 00:43:02,855
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.

435
00:43:11,113 --> 00:43:12,990
Thank you.

436
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:19,163
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

437
00:43:19,198 --> 00:43:22,916
It's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

438
00:43:23,083 --> 00:43:25,878
...of the former guidance counselor
has taken the stand.

439
00:43:26,086 --> 00:43:29,882
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan delivered
an emotional account of events...

440
00:43:30,049 --> 00:43:33,469
...and was not swayed by
defense counsel's cross-examination.

441
00:43:33,635 --> 00:43:36,847
We'll come back live later
with an update of these proceedings.

442
00:43:37,014 --> 00:43:39,808
Reporting from the courthouse
steps, I'm Nancy Duerr...

443
00:43:39,975 --> 00:43:41,894
...Eyewitness News.

444
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:02,247
Good morning, everybody.

445
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:05,918
Ms. Toller.

446
00:44:07,336 --> 00:44:09,380
When you were...

447
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:13,175
...picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...

448
00:44:13,342 --> 00:44:16,387
...and you were allowed
to make one call...

449
00:44:16,595 --> 00:44:19,765
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
Isn't that correct?

450
00:44:21,141 --> 00:44:22,810
Ms. Toller?

451
00:44:23,477 --> 00:44:25,729
- Yes.
- And when you were expelled...

452
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:28,273
...for destruction
of school property...

453
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,652
I broke a fucking window.
And it wasn't even my fault.

454
00:44:32,945 --> 00:44:36,407
Ms. Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...

455
00:44:36,615 --> 00:44:39,910
...and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.

456
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:47,710
It was Mr. Lombardo who appeared
with you in lieu of a parent conference.

457
00:44:47,876 --> 00:44:49,378
Is that right?

458
00:44:49,545 --> 00:44:50,921
Yes.

459
00:44:52,381 --> 00:44:54,299
It seems to me...

460
00:44:54,508 --> 00:44:57,803
...that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.

461
00:44:58,012 --> 00:44:59,680
He was.

462
00:45:00,848 --> 00:45:03,851
But all that changed when...

463
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:07,479
...according to your testimony...

464
00:45:08,313 --> 00:45:10,482
...Mr. Lombardo...

465
00:45:10,649 --> 00:45:12,359
...raped you...

466
00:45:12,985 --> 00:45:17,698
...on April 23 of last year,
is that right?

467
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:20,659
- Yes.
- But then in May...

468
00:45:21,285 --> 00:45:24,788
...when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...

469
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:27,458
...and again allowed a phone call...

470
00:45:29,084 --> 00:45:30,627
...you called Mr. Lombardo.

471
00:45:35,716 --> 00:45:39,011
- So what?
- So what?

472
00:45:41,930 --> 00:45:43,640
So what?

473
00:45:46,393 --> 00:45:48,187
Oops, Suzie.

474
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:54,068
So one month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

475
00:45:56,695 --> 00:45:59,865
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a good friend.

476
00:46:00,032 --> 00:46:02,576
- I needed help.
- I'm sure you did.

477
00:46:02,910 --> 00:46:04,912
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.

478
00:46:05,079 --> 00:46:06,830
It was summer, he was gone...

479
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:11,585
...and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.

480
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:14,171
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

481
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:18,050
...that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?

482
00:46:19,593 --> 00:46:22,930
Is that why you're saying
these things about Mr. Lombardo...

483
00:46:23,097 --> 00:46:25,724
...your friend?
- I said them because they happened.

484
00:46:25,891 --> 00:46:28,686
Ms. Toller, are you gonna
sit there today, under oath...

485
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,230
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?

486
00:46:31,397 --> 00:46:33,399
I said he did.

487
00:46:33,774 --> 00:46:36,235
Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Toller.

488
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:40,072
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

489
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:43,242
Because I promise you,
if you are lying about this...

490
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,035
...and I believe you are...

491
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:48,664
...that you will be visiting
that facility again quite soon.

492
00:46:48,956 --> 00:46:53,002
Which is why I'm gonna ask you
again now, under oath.

493
00:46:53,168 --> 00:46:54,837
Suzie...

494
00:46:56,088 --> 00:46:58,257
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

495
00:47:02,970 --> 00:47:06,348
Ms. Toller, you will have to
answer the question.

496
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:12,563
- Ms. Toller.
- Goddamn it!

497
00:47:15,107 --> 00:47:17,401
- This was not my idea.
- Objection, Your Honor.

498
00:47:17,735 --> 00:47:21,238
Ms. Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.

499
00:47:21,405 --> 00:47:24,616
Court would like to hear
what Ms. Toller has to say.

500
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:26,869
Ms. Toller?

501
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:32,249
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

502
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:36,003
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.

503
00:47:36,170 --> 00:47:40,632
This is ridiculous. The witness has
been threatened by defense counsel!

504
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:44,303
I think I made it plain this court
intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.

505
00:47:46,180 --> 00:47:47,973
Ms. Toller.

506
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:51,977
I just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.

507
00:47:52,686 --> 00:47:55,689
He was my friend at first.

508
00:47:55,856 --> 00:47:58,942
And then I got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...

509
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,487
...and I had to go away
to that hell hole.

510
00:48:01,695 --> 00:48:04,281
It's like you're his favorite,
and then "Who cares?"

511
00:48:04,448 --> 00:48:05,866
Make her stop.

512
00:48:06,033 --> 00:48:08,494
When Kelly said that
we should do this...

513
00:48:08,661 --> 00:48:10,496
...I thought, "Cool."
- Kelly!

514
00:48:10,704 --> 00:48:13,999
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop, Duquette.

515
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:17,336
- Now they're gonna get screwed.
- I'm sorry, Your Honor.

516
00:48:17,544 --> 00:48:18,837
I have to object.

517
00:48:19,004 --> 00:48:21,757
Your Honor, please, may I be heard?

518
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:25,803
Mr. Baxter, you are not
trying this case.

519
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,221
Go sit down.

520
00:48:32,643 --> 00:48:34,978
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.

521
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:38,023
She's in love with him.

522
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:40,442
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.

523
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:43,487
Then she found out he was doing
her mom, and that was it.

524
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:45,531
What? Kelly!

525
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:47,866
You skanky bitch!

526
00:48:48,909 --> 00:48:51,996
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who I am?

527
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:55,290
- I'm gonna have you fired on Monday!
- Right this way.

528
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,673
Just get the hell away from me.

529
00:49:04,967 --> 00:49:06,885
Jesus, man! Let loose!

530
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:11,181
I'm just thinking about where
I'm gonna stay.

531
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:13,642
I lost my house.

532
00:49:13,809 --> 00:49:15,853
Waking up from
a goddamn nightmare.

533
00:49:16,061 --> 00:49:17,521
You'll get over it.

534
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:20,858
We have got a knockdown,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

535
00:49:21,025 --> 00:49:23,360
...against Sandra Van Ryan.

536
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,362
Just like that?

537
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:26,780
Just like that?

538
00:49:27,531 --> 00:49:29,575
These people ruined your life, bro.

539
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:34,371
I told you they were gonna go too far.
They went overboard! They did!

540
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:39,001
They'll settle. Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.

541
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:42,880
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.

542
00:49:43,047 --> 00:49:46,300
In a startling turn of events,
Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...

543
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:50,054
...following a reversal of testimony
by one of his alleged victims.

544
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:52,264
Excuse me. Over here.

545
00:49:52,431 --> 00:49:54,099
Excuse me. Can anybody read?

546
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:58,062
Hey! Sandra!

547
00:49:58,312 --> 00:50:02,232
I want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

548
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:05,361
We could have,
if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...

549
00:50:05,527 --> 00:50:07,571
...hadn't thrown things.
- Fuck off.

550
00:50:07,780 --> 00:50:12,743
I cannot believe you're just gonna
let them get away with this shit!

551
00:50:12,951 --> 00:50:15,579
All on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.

552
00:50:15,746 --> 00:50:18,707
I don't think you get it, Sandy.

553
00:50:18,874 --> 00:50:20,876
Your princess here
committed perjury.

554
00:50:21,502 --> 00:50:24,797
It'll be all I can do to keep
her fucking little ass out of jail.

555
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:28,050
Well, what are we going to do?

556
00:50:35,641 --> 00:50:38,519
- You're gonna love this place, Tom.
- Thank you.

557
00:50:39,978 --> 00:50:42,147
That jalapeño pork platter
will kill you.

558
00:50:44,692 --> 00:50:47,736
I mean, you can't eat sushi every day
of the week.

559
00:50:47,903 --> 00:50:50,322
Bowden, why don't you
cut the crap...

560
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:53,450
...and tell me
what your client really wants.

561
00:50:56,370 --> 00:50:58,330
Okay, Baxter.

562
00:50:58,497 --> 00:51:02,376
My client wants your client
to saddle up...

563
00:51:02,543 --> 00:51:05,129
...so we can ride her ass
straight to the bank.

564
00:51:08,382 --> 00:51:11,343
You know, Ken.

565
00:51:11,635 --> 00:51:12,886
May I call you Ken?

566
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:17,683
There will be other cases,
other days.

567
00:51:20,227 --> 00:51:22,604
The way I see it...

568
00:51:23,355 --> 00:51:25,065
...Tommy...

569
00:51:25,232 --> 00:51:28,569
...is that everybody's gotta
eat some shit sometime.

570
00:51:30,529 --> 00:51:32,281
You like yours hot?

571
00:51:32,448 --> 00:51:34,241
Yeah.

572
00:51:42,249 --> 00:51:45,169
- Here's your coffee, Sam.
- Thank you.

573
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:00,434
Ken.

574
00:52:12,571 --> 00:52:14,823
Sorry I'm late.

575
00:52:14,990 --> 00:52:16,408
Hold my calls, Lenore.

576
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:18,619
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

577
00:52:41,308 --> 00:52:43,310
Thank you, Sandra.

578
00:52:48,774 --> 00:52:50,651
I'll be seeing you.

579
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:53,112
- Okay?
- Okay. Yeah.

580
00:52:59,284 --> 00:53:01,495
Nice to see you, Tom.

581
00:53:01,829 --> 00:53:03,414
Come by.
We'll have lunch.

582
00:53:07,001 --> 00:53:09,128
See you at the club.

583
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,424
See you at the club.

584
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:16,301
See you at the club.

585
00:53:16,510 --> 00:53:18,470
See you at the club.

586
00:53:19,138 --> 00:53:20,806
See you at the club, Tommy!

587
00:53:20,973 --> 00:53:23,976
Hey, Tom.
What did you shoot today, pal?

588
00:53:24,184 --> 00:53:26,228
Hey, my man!

589
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:30,357
This is for you.

590
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:33,152
- You did good, Ken.
- Yeah.

591
00:53:33,319 --> 00:53:34,987
Thanks.

592
00:53:36,196 --> 00:53:40,200
I know there's a part of you that wishes
none of this had happened, but it did.

593
00:53:40,367 --> 00:53:43,162
So take the money
and enjoy yourself.

594
00:53:43,370 --> 00:53:46,373
All right? Find a happy place.

595
00:53:46,582 --> 00:53:49,293
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?

596
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:52,671
- Goodbye, Sam.
- Bye, Lenore.

597
00:54:10,064 --> 00:54:12,524
Take care of my lizards?
