1
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:54,569
Forget it, loser.

2
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,127
Forget it, loser.

3
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:58,295
Oh, Mr. Lombardo.

4
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,167
-Hey.
-Hey, bro.

5
00:04:00,342 --> 00:04:02,674
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

6
00:04:03,345 --> 00:04:05,609
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

7
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,577
Jennifer--

8
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,220
Did you see his eyes?

9
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,445
What are you looking at, dork?

10
00:04:42,317 --> 00:04:44,251
Fuck off.

11
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:47,016
l appreciate you guys coming down.

12
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:51,320
The only thing l'm gonna miss
in this dump is....

13
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:54,292
Settle down.

14
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,891
Settle down.

15
00:04:57,399 --> 00:05:02,496
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

16
00:05:05,173 --> 00:05:07,505
Settle down.
Settle down.

17
00:05:07,676 --> 00:05:10,941
-Beats study hall, doesn't it?
-No!

18
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:16,046
-That you, Jimmy?
-At least in study hall l can meditate.

19
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:18,378
What he means is, ''masturbate.''

20
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,218
Something with which l'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.

21
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,544
lt wasn't me, man.
lt wasn't me.

22
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:53,819
l'm innocent.
l'm innocent.

23
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:58,925
We've all heard the terms
''date rape,'' ''sexual harassment.''

24
00:05:59,728 --> 00:06:03,687
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.

25
00:06:04,466 --> 00:06:08,232
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

26
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,367
Detectives Duquette and Perez...

27
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,405
...are here to give us
what we hope...

28
00:06:14,576 --> 00:06:16,976
...will be a fresh perspective
on the subject...

29
00:06:17,145 --> 00:06:20,603
...and to address any questions
that any of you might have.

30
00:06:20,782 --> 00:06:23,307
Now, let's give them
a warm welcome.

31
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:28,313
-Thank you.
-l'm out of here.

32
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:32,153
-Why don't we begin with a question.
-This prick can kiss my ass.

33
00:06:41,136 --> 00:06:42,967
As l was saying...

34
00:06:43,138 --> 00:06:45,732
...why don't we begin
with a question.

35
00:06:45,907 --> 00:06:49,934
-What is a sex crime?
-Not getting any.

36
00:07:15,756 --> 00:07:17,485
Steady.

37
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,460
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

38
00:07:26,567 --> 00:07:27,829
That's good.

39
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,307
Drop the main.

40
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:41,745
All right, guys, let's de-rig
and l'll see you all Monday.

41
00:07:49,557 --> 00:07:52,025
Hey, ladies, my car needs a wash.

42
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,793
Do you do windows?

43
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:56,759
Good work, guys.
A.C., see you Monday.

44
00:07:56,931 --> 00:07:59,195
-See you, Mr. Lombardo.
-All right, buddy.

45
00:08:10,511 --> 00:08:11,944
All right.

46
00:08:12,113 --> 00:08:14,206
l could definitely party
on one of those.

47
00:08:17,251 --> 00:08:19,151
lt's a stinkpot, Jimmy.

48
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,381
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.

49
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:27,054
Yeah.

50
00:08:27,228 --> 00:08:29,128
That's a real boat.

51
00:08:30,932 --> 00:08:33,093
Thank you for getting me
into this class.

52
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:35,895
No way my old man was gonna
spring for the fees.

53
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,097
Hey, you're working for it, and you're
learning your way around a boat.

54
00:08:40,274 --> 00:08:42,572
l put myself through college
working on boats.

55
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:44,836
-Beats flipping burgers.
-Yeah.

56
00:08:46,113 --> 00:08:49,947
Can l play too, or is it just for boys?

57
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,689
So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?

58
00:08:58,059 --> 00:08:59,959
The senior car wash, remember?

59
00:09:00,328 --> 00:09:02,819
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.

60
00:09:02,997 --> 00:09:05,431
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and l do it?

61
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,397
We're working as a team.

62
00:09:07,568 --> 00:09:10,969
l tell you what. l'm going out
to the glades Saturday.

63
00:09:11,138 --> 00:09:14,107
Why don't you come over Sunday
and wash all the mud off.

64
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:15,867
Deal.

65
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,809
l was counting on my mom
to give me a ride, but she's not here.

66
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,448
Surprise, surprise.

67
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:24,380
So l was wondering
if you could give me one.

68
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:29,451
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?

69
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:32,024
l mean, like,
something bad might happen.

70
00:09:34,795 --> 00:09:38,196
-What about you, you need a lift?
-Yeah, but l got my bike.

71
00:09:38,366 --> 00:09:40,334
Hey, no problem.

72
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,779
Okay, try it.

73
00:09:58,586 --> 00:10:02,078
Suzie, you need a lift?
We got room for one more.

74
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:06,249
Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes,
''Whores 4 Less''?

75
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:10,961
Try it again.

76
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:19,266
Nice to see you kids getting along.

77
00:11:01,415 --> 00:11:04,646
-Don't forget Sunday.
-l won't.

78
00:11:07,655 --> 00:11:10,818
-ls that Sam Lombardo?
-Hi, Mom.

79
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,956
Sam, hi.

80
00:11:13,394 --> 00:11:15,555
Hi, Sandra.

81
00:11:17,164 --> 00:11:21,066
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.

82
00:11:21,235 --> 00:11:22,725
Sorry, Sandra, l gotta run.

83
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:40,913
-Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
-Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

84
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:44,050
Hi, girls.

85
00:12:44,518 --> 00:12:46,418
Look. He forgot.

86
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:48,748
-l knew it.
-No, l didn't.

87
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:51,915
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.

88
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:55,059
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.

89
00:12:55,229 --> 00:12:58,392
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?

90
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:02,866
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

91
00:13:03,037 --> 00:13:04,629
Sam, l'm leaving.

92
00:13:04,805 --> 00:13:07,365
So where's your hose,
Mr. Lombardo?

93
00:13:09,443 --> 00:13:12,435
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.

94
00:13:17,318 --> 00:13:20,116
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?

95
00:13:21,021 --> 00:13:23,012
Come on, Barbara.
lt's for a good cause.

96
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:27,891
Sam the philanthropist.

97
00:13:28,062 --> 00:13:31,759
Yeah, well, you know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.

98
00:13:31,932 --> 00:13:33,661
Okay.

99
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:38,236
-Have fun at the club.
-Okay.

100
00:14:38,899 --> 00:14:40,423
Wow.

101
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:43,502
Looks brand-new.

102
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,365
Aren't you forgetting something?

103
00:14:49,243 --> 00:14:51,973
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.

104
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:53,943
Oh, yeah, that thing.

105
00:14:54,315 --> 00:14:58,149
-Can't we just--?
-Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

106
00:14:58,986 --> 00:15:00,613
Okay, let me look for it.

107
00:15:00,788 --> 00:15:04,053
Mr. Lombardo,
we're running kind of late.

108
00:15:04,325 --> 00:15:06,486
How about if Nicole goes on
to the Mansons'?

109
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,560
You can give me a ride
when you find it.

110
00:15:08,829 --> 00:15:13,061
No, no, just give me a minute. Okay?

111
00:15:18,806 --> 00:15:21,866
-Go.
-Are you sure?

112
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,575
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, God.

113
00:16:37,751 --> 00:16:41,983
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

114
00:16:42,956 --> 00:16:45,424
Goddamn it!

115
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,024
<i>-Hello, this is Blue Bay High School.
-Hello.</i>

116
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:51,528
<i>Your son or daughter
was absent today, Monday--</i>

117
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:53,791
Jesus H. Christ!

118
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:57,737
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

119
00:16:57,905 --> 00:16:59,133
Come on.

120
00:17:01,942 --> 00:17:05,434
-Art, this is a hell of a fish you caught.
-lt's a barracuda.

121
00:17:05,846 --> 00:17:08,212
lf you weren't so busy
chasing booty...

122
00:17:08,382 --> 00:17:11,476
...you'd have come with me
and caught one for yourself.

123
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:14,052
Don't tell me you're gonna
eat this thing.

124
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:15,483
Why not?

125
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:18,250
lt's a barracuda. lt's poisonous.
lt'll kill you.

126
00:17:18,425 --> 00:17:21,952
Shit, man, l could say that
about most of the girls you date.

127
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:24,256
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

128
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:34,934
<i>-Sandra, what's up?
-Kelly skipped school today, Sam.</i>

129
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:37,634
Have you heard anything?

130
00:17:38,078 --> 00:17:39,306
Not a word.

131
00:17:40,481 --> 00:17:42,506
Never mind.

132
00:17:42,883 --> 00:17:45,113
l found her.

133
00:17:47,955 --> 00:17:49,684
Pull!

134
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:53,992
Listen, Sam, it was really good
seeing you the other day.

135
00:17:54,595 --> 00:17:56,529
Sandra, l'm real busy right now, so--

136
00:17:57,764 --> 00:18:01,632
l haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

137
00:18:03,804 --> 00:18:06,534
<i>-Yeah, well--
-l know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.</i>

138
00:18:06,874 --> 00:18:11,436
<i>-So what?
-So maybe l'm a one-woman man now.</i>

139
00:18:12,479 --> 00:18:15,141
<i>Aw, poor Sam.</i>

140
00:18:15,315 --> 00:18:18,648
Really think you'll get one of these
Blue Bay women to marry you?

141
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:22,114
<i>-Are you finished, Sandra?
-Grab a clue, honey.</i>

142
00:18:22,289 --> 00:18:25,452
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.

143
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:27,890
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

144
00:18:28,061 --> 00:18:29,995
Goodbye, Sandra.

145
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:33,365
Pull!

146
00:18:35,769 --> 00:18:39,000
You seem to find guns therapeutic.

147
00:18:40,741 --> 00:18:42,265
Maybe l ought to try it.

148
00:18:44,444 --> 00:18:45,877
So let me guess.

149
00:18:46,046 --> 00:18:48,879
Some boy didn't call and screwed up
your whole weekend.

150
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:52,246
So you're taking the day off. Right?

151
00:18:55,756 --> 00:18:58,054
Which one of your deck hands
is that?

152
00:18:58,225 --> 00:19:00,489
Whichever one l want.

153
00:19:03,163 --> 00:19:06,655
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

154
00:19:10,103 --> 00:19:11,627
What is it?

155
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,131
l miss Dad.

156
00:19:15,909 --> 00:19:17,706
Jesus.

157
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,945
l miss him too, sometimes.

158
00:19:23,183 --> 00:19:24,411
No, you don't.

159
00:19:24,585 --> 00:19:27,281
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

160
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,524
Oh, Kelly....

161
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,699
l don't know why he did it.

162
00:19:44,705 --> 00:19:46,764
l really don't.

163
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:53,505
Can l--?

164
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:58,949
Can l get you anything?

165
00:19:59,686 --> 00:20:01,244
Do you want a Valium?

166
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:07,724
l was raped.

167
00:20:09,029 --> 00:20:13,363
-What, honey? l can't hear you.
-l said, l was raped.

168
00:20:13,533 --> 00:20:15,228
What?

169
00:20:18,372 --> 00:20:20,533
l was raped...

170
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:24,367
...by Sam Lombardo.

171
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,280
Sam Lombardo?

172
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,317
My daughter does not
get raped in Blue Bay!

173
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,145
And you're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?

174
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:40,157
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

175
00:20:41,295 --> 00:20:43,729
We understand your feelings,
Miss Van Ryan...

176
00:20:43,897 --> 00:20:46,957
...but please,
we need some time with Kelly.

177
00:20:47,234 --> 00:20:49,293
We'd like to take her statement alone.

178
00:20:53,473 --> 00:20:55,964
-Are you all right with this, baby?
-Yeah.

179
00:20:56,143 --> 00:20:57,633
Okay.

180
00:21:07,854 --> 00:21:10,414
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

181
00:21:11,725 --> 00:21:13,249
l just wanna get it over with.

182
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:17,153
We'd like to videotape this statement.

183
00:21:17,331 --> 00:21:20,767
l know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...

184
00:21:20,934 --> 00:21:25,462
...and we need to know everything that
happened between the two of you.

185
00:21:25,806 --> 00:21:27,433
Are you ready?

186
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,176
He started rubbing my shoulders.

187
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:44,322
<i>I let him.</i>

188
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:47,016
<i>I mean, he's a nice guy.</i>

189
00:21:48,528 --> 00:21:50,393
<i>The next thing...</i>

190
00:21:51,198 --> 00:21:54,497
<i>...his hand was in my shorts.</i>

191
00:21:55,836 --> 00:21:57,770
<i>You know, from behind.</i>

192
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:02,909
<i>His fingers....</i>

193
00:22:04,778 --> 00:22:08,043
<i>-His fingers....
-Take your time.</i>

194
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:13,719
<i>They were in me.</i>

195
00:22:13,987 --> 00:22:15,784
<i>Both places, you know?</i>

196
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:20,419
<i>Did he put himself inside you?</i>

197
00:22:21,561 --> 00:22:23,153
<i>Yes.</i>

198
00:22:23,864 --> 00:22:25,991
<i>I said ''Stop. ''
I screamed.</i>

199
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:29,192
<i>I mean, that's how it
sounded in my head.</i>

200
00:22:30,904 --> 00:22:32,599
<i>He hurt me.</i>

201
00:22:33,273 --> 00:22:35,264
<i>Did you try to fight him?</i>

202
00:22:37,944 --> 00:22:40,777
<i>Well, he had my wrists
pinned behind me.</i>

203
00:22:40,947 --> 00:22:42,346
<i>Then what?</i>

204
00:22:42,516 --> 00:22:45,747
<i>He kept saying, ''Let it happen.</i>

205
00:22:46,119 --> 00:22:48,019
<i>Let it happen. ''</i>

206
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:52,020
<i>And then he just stopped.</i>

207
00:22:52,325 --> 00:22:54,384
<i>You mean he withdrew?</i>

208
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:57,928
<i>I don't know. It's really hard
to remember, exactly.</i>

209
00:22:58,665 --> 00:23:00,292
<i>Try, Kelly.</i>

210
00:23:05,672 --> 00:23:07,697
<i>I know one thing he said.</i>

211
00:23:08,809 --> 00:23:12,870
<i>He said, ''Don't worry.
I didn't come. ''</i>

212
00:23:13,313 --> 00:23:15,338
<i>I can't forget that.</i>

213
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:20,914
<i>He said, ''No little girl
can ever make me come. ''</i>

214
00:23:24,691 --> 00:23:28,218
''No little girl can ever
make me come.'' Jesus.

215
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:31,455
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.

216
00:23:33,733 --> 00:23:34,961
What?

217
00:23:35,135 --> 00:23:38,969
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

218
00:23:40,607 --> 00:23:43,735
You want my gut? There it is.
l think she's acting.

219
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,243
l think she set it up to be alone
with him so he'd come on to her.

220
00:23:47,414 --> 00:23:49,075
She's upset because he didn't.

221
00:23:49,249 --> 00:23:51,945
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.

222
00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:54,985
The guy never should've had her
there in the first place.

223
00:23:55,155 --> 00:23:58,215
The line l have on him,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

224
00:23:58,391 --> 00:24:00,621
That doesn't make him a rapist.

225
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:03,087
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?

226
00:24:03,263 --> 00:24:05,595
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?

227
00:24:05,765 --> 00:24:07,198
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.

228
00:24:07,367 --> 00:24:12,066
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector
test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

229
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:15,436
You afraid of Tom Baxter now?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

230
00:24:15,609 --> 00:24:18,703
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.

231
00:24:18,879 --> 00:24:22,042
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.

232
00:24:22,215 --> 00:24:24,979
-You know what that'll mean for him.
-Yeah.

233
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:30,350
And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.

234
00:25:22,976 --> 00:25:24,307
All right.

235
00:25:24,477 --> 00:25:26,342
Good work, Jimbo.
l'll see you Monday.

236
00:25:26,513 --> 00:25:27,844
All right.

237
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:37,349
That's what's left of my sailing class.

238
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,691
Talk to me, Artie.

239
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,027
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.

240
00:25:48,101 --> 00:25:49,830
Jimmy told me.

241
00:25:50,337 --> 00:25:52,635
Apparently, l'm the last one
to know about it.

242
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:54,774
Sam, l....

243
00:25:55,709 --> 00:25:58,075
Sandra Van Ryan has been
on the horn all day...

244
00:25:58,244 --> 00:26:00,337
...with every member
of the school board.

245
00:26:00,513 --> 00:26:01,980
She's pushing for suspension.

246
00:26:02,148 --> 00:26:05,982
And the board's just gonna roll over
for her without hearing my side?

247
00:26:06,152 --> 00:26:09,952
This is insane.
l'm innocent, goddamn it.

248
00:26:10,123 --> 00:26:11,590
You gotta believe that.

249
00:26:11,758 --> 00:26:13,988
All l can tell you, Sam,
is hang in there.

250
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,151
They clear you, you get reinstated--

251
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:18,991
You never get clear
of something like this.

252
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:22,124
lt stays with you.

253
00:26:22,302 --> 00:26:25,738
lt follows you around forever.

254
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,703
You're gonna need some help, Sam.

255
00:26:29,709 --> 00:26:31,836
You're gonna need an attorney.

256
00:26:32,012 --> 00:26:35,379
Right. And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...

257
00:26:35,548 --> 00:26:38,540
...is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.

258
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:59,029
l'm here to see Ken Bowden.

259
00:26:59,205 --> 00:27:03,266
-Do you have an appointment?
-Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.

260
00:27:03,443 --> 00:27:05,536
Okay, then.

261
00:27:05,745 --> 00:27:08,270
Mr. Bowden,
your 1 0:30's here.

262
00:27:08,448 --> 00:27:10,416
Will you show him in, please?

263
00:27:13,386 --> 00:27:15,286
What brings you
to this part of town?

264
00:27:16,256 --> 00:27:18,383
Well, l was, until yesterday...

265
00:27:18,558 --> 00:27:21,550
...a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.

266
00:27:23,463 --> 00:27:25,488
A student there
is accusing me of rape.

267
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,531
Male or female?

268
00:27:29,969 --> 00:27:32,733
-The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
-As in Sandra Van Ryan?

269
00:27:32,906 --> 00:27:35,374
As in, l'm fucked.

270
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:39,569
Why don't you tell me about it?

271
00:27:41,681 --> 00:27:43,808
-Shit, where do l begin?
-Start with...

272
00:27:45,251 --> 00:27:47,981
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.

273
00:27:49,055 --> 00:27:53,458
She's a student. l was her counselor.
Beyond that, there's no relationship.

274
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:56,085
You got nothing to worry about.

275
00:27:59,933 --> 00:28:02,401
-What did you do to your neck?
-This?

276
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:05,197
l don't have to wear it all the time.

277
00:28:09,142 --> 00:28:11,906
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.

278
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:17,083
All right, let me tell you
how l charge.

279
00:28:25,258 --> 00:28:27,226
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?

280
00:28:27,393 --> 00:28:30,055
Mr. Lombardo, l'm afraid
l can't park your car today.

281
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:33,791
You can't park me?
l'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

282
00:28:39,205 --> 00:28:42,265
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.

283
00:28:42,442 --> 00:28:44,433
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

284
00:28:45,612 --> 00:28:49,378
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

285
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:57,419
Barbara, let's go.

286
00:29:01,528 --> 00:29:04,122
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.

287
00:29:04,297 --> 00:29:06,822
You're finished in Blue Bay.

288
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:12,630
l find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

289
00:29:13,439 --> 00:29:17,205
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Mr. Lombardo, please.

290
00:29:22,448 --> 00:29:24,279
That's all right, George.

291
00:29:47,707 --> 00:29:51,234
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.

292
00:29:51,411 --> 00:29:54,642
-Welcome back.
-Rum and Coke.

293
00:31:25,038 --> 00:31:27,165
Hey! Are you all right?

294
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:29,733
-l'm fine.
-Cool?

295
00:31:29,909 --> 00:31:32,070
That's too bad, motherfucker.

296
00:31:45,458 --> 00:31:47,289
Sam?

297
00:31:52,465 --> 00:31:54,330
Lombardo?

298
00:32:15,355 --> 00:32:18,256
Whoa, man! lt's me.

299
00:32:19,659 --> 00:32:22,958
Sorry, man. Things have been
getting a little weird around here.

300
00:32:23,129 --> 00:32:25,029
l can see that.

301
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,466
Come on in.

302
00:32:31,471 --> 00:32:35,669
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy that did this to you?

303
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:37,941
lt was him, all right.

304
00:32:38,111 --> 00:32:40,671
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

305
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:44,305
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

306
00:32:44,484 --> 00:32:47,715
-Forget it.
-The lady has deep pockets.

307
00:32:47,887 --> 00:32:50,617
Believe me, l know how deep
her pockets are.

308
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:55,227
l thought l might be able to save
my house. Some sort of equity loan.

309
00:32:55,595 --> 00:32:59,122
Guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

310
00:32:59,532 --> 00:33:02,467
l don't need any more trouble
from this woman.

311
00:33:02,635 --> 00:33:05,763
You think making some sort
of statement's gonna stop her?

312
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:09,074
With the shit l got on Kelly?
Yeah.

313
00:33:10,209 --> 00:33:11,699
A year ago...

314
00:33:11,878 --> 00:33:14,540
...when her old man
blew his brains out...

315
00:33:14,714 --> 00:33:16,944
...Kelly lost it, ran away.

316
00:33:17,116 --> 00:33:21,314
They found her in a fleabag motel
some place, coked out of her gourd.

317
00:33:22,288 --> 00:33:24,051
Meanwhile...

318
00:33:24,223 --> 00:33:27,624
...you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...

319
00:33:27,794 --> 00:33:29,056
...or some crap.

320
00:33:29,429 --> 00:33:31,897
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...

321
00:33:32,265 --> 00:33:35,234
...they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.

322
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:38,165
Why do you think they haven't
taken your statement yet?

323
00:33:38,938 --> 00:33:40,963
Because they're busy
looking for dirt.

324
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,903
And they're not gonna find it.

325
00:33:46,312 --> 00:33:48,177
Right?

326
00:33:49,482 --> 00:33:52,645
Ken, l don't fuck my students.

327
00:34:28,454 --> 00:34:30,979
He's just showing off
for you now.

328
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:35,286
Hey there, Ruby.

329
00:34:35,528 --> 00:34:37,758
l see you still got Walter.

330
00:34:38,331 --> 00:34:40,697
l was hoping something
had eaten him by now.

331
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:46,029
-Can l help you with something?
-Suzie called us.

332
00:34:46,205 --> 00:34:48,264
Where would we find her?

333
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:51,409
You know the way.

334
00:34:57,783 --> 00:35:00,547
You won't shoot her, will you?

335
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:05,551
l don't believe she's armed.

336
00:35:41,627 --> 00:35:43,026
Yeah?

337
00:35:47,733 --> 00:35:49,496
Jesus, it took you guys
long enough.

338
00:35:49,669 --> 00:35:54,470
What if someone was trying to
strangle me or fuck me in the ass?

339
00:35:56,709 --> 00:35:58,700
l mean,
you guys do sex crimes, right?

340
00:35:59,445 --> 00:36:01,845
My partner, Detective Perez.

341
00:36:07,853 --> 00:36:12,153
lt's C¨¦line. He's okay. He had a good
line on what cheap fucks people are.

342
00:36:12,325 --> 00:36:15,089
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us.
Remember?

343
00:36:23,135 --> 00:36:25,626
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

344
00:36:27,206 --> 00:36:28,901
No.

345
00:36:29,909 --> 00:36:32,901
-Will they?
-l don't know.

346
00:36:33,512 --> 00:36:34,945
That bothers you?

347
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:40,318
l wanna go outside.

348
00:36:47,326 --> 00:36:50,454
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?

349
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:52,621
About a year ago.

350
00:36:52,798 --> 00:36:55,961
And when you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?

351
00:36:56,135 --> 00:36:58,729
-Nope.
-So you were alone.

352
00:36:58,904 --> 00:37:00,565
Yeah.

353
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,571
Did he come in with you?

354
00:37:02,742 --> 00:37:07,338
-l guess.
-You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?

355
00:37:07,513 --> 00:37:10,448
Okay. Yeah, he did.

356
00:37:10,616 --> 00:37:12,208
And then what? Did he touch you?

357
00:37:12,385 --> 00:37:15,320
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?

358
00:37:15,988 --> 00:37:18,889
Suzie, look, l know you feel bad.

359
00:37:19,425 --> 00:37:23,486
-Just tell us the truth.
-l didn't say a thing to him.

360
00:37:24,463 --> 00:37:28,331
He just put his arm around me
and told me l was pretty.

361
00:37:29,135 --> 00:37:31,626
l could be really pretty, he said.

362
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:34,033
Did you ask him to stop?

363
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:36,731
Shit.

364
00:37:37,176 --> 00:37:39,974
What difference does it make?
No one believes me anyway.

365
00:37:40,146 --> 00:37:43,377
-Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
-Yeah. Okay? He did.

366
00:37:43,549 --> 00:37:45,847
He pushed me to the floor
and he did it to me.

367
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,884
-Now are we done?
-Almost, Suzie.

368
00:37:51,057 --> 00:37:52,820
Almost.

369
00:37:53,893 --> 00:37:56,521
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?

370
00:37:57,563 --> 00:38:01,055
No. He stopped by himself.

371
00:38:01,667 --> 00:38:04,727
Okay? ls that it?
Leave me alone.

372
00:38:05,271 --> 00:38:08,707
-Don't touch me!
-All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

373
00:38:08,874 --> 00:38:10,671
He stopped.

374
00:38:10,843 --> 00:38:14,074
And that was it? He just left?

375
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:16,445
Yeah.

376
00:38:17,983 --> 00:38:20,281
He did say one thing first.

377
00:38:20,553 --> 00:38:22,020
What was that?

378
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:26,782
He said, ''No little bitch
can ever make me come.''

379
00:38:29,795 --> 00:38:31,626
Open the gate.

380
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:40,436
-Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
-Hello, Jinxy.

381
00:38:43,709 --> 00:38:46,974
You know, it's really a
bad news, good news situation.

382
00:38:47,913 --> 00:38:51,849
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...

383
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:54,042
...instead of a public defender.

384
00:38:55,054 --> 00:38:57,454
l'm telling you, Ken, l'm innocent.

385
00:38:58,324 --> 00:39:02,124
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

386
00:39:09,235 --> 00:39:11,635
So you're the new
chicken licker.

387
00:39:20,813 --> 00:39:22,508
Sandra, can we get your comment?

388
00:39:22,681 --> 00:39:24,808
Can l just have your feelings
at this time?

389
00:39:24,984 --> 00:39:27,452
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.

390
00:39:28,154 --> 00:39:29,746
Can you tell us anything?

391
00:39:29,922 --> 00:39:32,254
-Are you confident about the case?
-Very. Yes.

392
00:39:32,425 --> 00:39:35,292
The Lombardo rape case
has galvanized the upscale town...

393
00:39:35,461 --> 00:39:37,452
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.

394
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:39,530
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...

395
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:43,566
...jet-set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

396
00:39:43,736 --> 00:39:47,399
And the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. ln the end, the jury...

397
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:50,440
...must choose between the words
of these 1 8-year-old girls...

398
00:39:50,609 --> 00:39:52,201
...and that of Sam Lombardo.

And even though it's something
we've been over...

410

...l want us all
to be very clear about it.

411
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:31,442
Kelly , when you saw
that Mr. Lombardo...

412
00:41:32,044 --> 00:41:34,808
...intended to have sex with you...

415
00:41:40,786 --> 00:41:43,220
l told him ''No.''

416
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:47,052
l said,
''Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please.''

417
00:41:49,628 --> 00:41:52,654
l screamed for him to stop.

418
00:41:53,232 --> 00:41:55,097
You screamed for him...

419

...to stop.

420
00:41:58,804 --> 00:42:00,601
And did he?

421
00:42:02,074 --> 00:42:03,769
No.

422
00:42:04,643 --> 00:42:07,771
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.

423

Good morning, everybody.

433
00:43:09,408 --> 00:43:10,841
Ms. Toller.

434
00:43:12,277 --> 00:43:14,302
When you were...

435
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:18,109
...picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...

436
00:43:18,283 --> 00:43:21,343
...and you were allowed
to make one call...

437
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,683
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
lsn't that correct?

438
00:43:26,058 --> 00:43:27,753
Ms. Toller?

439
00:43:28,427 --> 00:43:30,657
-Yes.
-And when you were expelled...

440
00:43:30,829 --> 00:43:33,195
...for destruction
of school property--

441
00:43:33,365 --> 00:43:36,596
l broke a fucking window.
And it wasn't even my fault.

442
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:41,362
Ms. Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...

443
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:44,839
...and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.

444
00:43:48,947 --> 00:43:52,644
lt was Mr. Lombardo who appeared
with you in lieu of a parent conference.

445
00:43:52,818 --> 00:43:54,308
ls that right?

446
00:43:54,486 --> 00:43:55,851
Yes.

447
00:43:57,322 --> 00:43:59,256
lt seems to me...

448
00:43:59,425 --> 00:44:02,758
...that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.

449
00:44:02,928 --> 00:44:04,623
He was.

450
00:44:05,798 --> 00:44:08,767
But all that changed when...

451
00:44:10,102 --> 00:44:12,400
...according to your testimony...

452
00:44:13,238 --> 00:44:15,399
...Mr. Lombardo...

453
00:44:15,574 --> 00:44:17,303
...raped you...

454
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:22,643
...on April 23 of last year,
is that right?

455
00:44:23,382 --> 00:44:25,577
-Yes.
-But then in May...

456
00:44:26,218 --> 00:44:29,745
...when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...

457
00:44:29,922 --> 00:44:32,413
...and again allowed a phone call...

458
00:44:34,026 --> 00:44:35,550
...you called Mr. Lombardo.

459
00:44:40,666 --> 00:44:43,965
-So what?
-So what?

460
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:48,567
So what?

461
00:44:51,343 --> 00:44:53,106
Oops, Suzie.

462
00:44:54,246 --> 00:44:59,013
So one month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

463
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:04,783
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a good friend.

464
00:45:04,957 --> 00:45:07,517
-l needed help.
-l'm sure you did.

465
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,851
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.

466
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:11,757
lt was summer, he was gone...

467
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:16,528
...and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.

468
00:45:17,002 --> 00:45:19,095
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

469
00:45:19,271 --> 00:45:22,968
...that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?

470
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:27,877
ls that why you're saying
these things about Mr. Lombardo...

471
00:45:28,046 --> 00:45:30,640
-...your friend?
-l said them because they happened.

472
00:45:30,816 --> 00:45:33,614
Ms. Toller, are you gonna
sit there today, under oath...

473
00:45:33,786 --> 00:45:36,152
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?

474
00:45:36,321 --> 00:45:38,346
l said he did.

475
00:45:38,690 --> 00:45:41,181
Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Toller.

476
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:44,989
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

477
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:48,159
Because l promise you,
if you are lying about this...

478
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:49,960
...and l believe you are...

479
00:45:50,135 --> 00:45:53,593
...that you will be visiting
that facility again quite soon.

480
00:45:53,872 --> 00:45:57,933
Which is why l'm gonna ask you
again now, under oath.

481
00:45:58,110 --> 00:45:59,771
Suzie...

482
00:46:01,013 --> 00:46:03,208
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

483
00:46:07,886 --> 00:46:11,287
Ms. Toller, you will have to
answer the question.

484
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,487
-Ms. Toller.
-Goddamn it!

485
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:22,330
-This was not my idea.
-Objection, Your Honor.

486
00:46:22,668 --> 00:46:26,160
Ms. Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.

487
00:46:26,338 --> 00:46:29,535
Court would like to hear
what Ms. Toller has to say.

488
00:46:29,775 --> 00:46:31,800
Ms. Toller?

489
00:46:34,746 --> 00:46:37,180
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

490
00:46:38,750 --> 00:46:40,945
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.

491
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:45,556
This is ridiculous. The witness has
been threatened by defense counsel!

492
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:49,251
l think l made it plain this court
intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.

493
00:46:51,129 --> 00:46:52,926
Ms. Toller.

494
00:46:54,099 --> 00:46:56,897
l just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.

495
00:46:57,603 --> 00:47:00,629
He was my friend at first.

496
00:47:00,806 --> 00:47:03,866
And then l got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...

497
00:47:04,042 --> 00:47:06,442
...and l had to go away
to that hell hole.

498
00:47:06,612 --> 00:47:09,206
lt's like you're his favorite,
and then ''Who cares?''

499
00:47:09,381 --> 00:47:10,814
Make her stop.

500
00:47:10,983 --> 00:47:13,417
When Kelly said that
we should do this...

501
00:47:13,585 --> 00:47:15,450
-...l thought, ''Cool.''
-Kelly!

502
00:47:15,621 --> 00:47:18,920
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop, Duquette.

503
00:47:19,091 --> 00:47:22,288
-Now they're gonna get screwed.
-l'm sorry, Your Honor.

504
00:47:22,461 --> 00:47:23,758
l have to object.

505
00:47:23,929 --> 00:47:26,693
Your Honor, please, may l be heard?

506
00:47:26,865 --> 00:47:30,733
Mr. Baxter, you are not
trying this case.

507
00:47:30,903 --> 00:47:32,165
Go sit down.

508
00:47:37,576 --> 00:47:39,908
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.

509
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:42,942
She's in love with him.

510
00:47:43,115 --> 00:47:45,379
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.

511
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,417
Then she found out he was doing
her mom, and that was it.

512
00:47:48,587 --> 00:47:50,487
What? Kelly!

513
00:47:50,656 --> 00:47:52,817
You skanky bitch!

514
00:47:53,825 --> 00:47:56,919
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who l am?

515
00:47:57,095 --> 00:48:00,223
-l'm gonna have you fired on Monday!
-Right this way.

516
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,600
Just get the hell away from me.

517
00:48:09,908 --> 00:48:11,842
Jesus, man! Let loose!

518
00:48:13,111 --> 00:48:16,137
l'm just thinking about where
l'm gonna stay.

519
00:48:16,315 --> 00:48:18,579
l lost my house.

520
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:20,809
Waking up from
a goddamn nightmare.

521
00:48:20,986 --> 00:48:22,476
You'll get over it.

522
00:48:22,654 --> 00:48:25,782
We have got a knockdown,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

523
00:48:25,958 --> 00:48:28,290
...against Sandra Van Ryan.

524
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,291
Just like that?

525
00:48:30,462 --> 00:48:31,724
Just like that?

526
00:48:32,464 --> 00:48:34,523
These people ruined your life, bro.

527
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:39,303
l told you they were gonna go too far.
They went overboard! They did!

528
00:48:39,471 --> 00:48:43,931
They'll settle. Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.

529
00:48:44,409 --> 00:48:47,810
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.

530
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:51,245
<i>In a startling turn of events,
Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...</i>

531
00:48:51,416 --> 00:48:54,977
<i>...following a reversal of testimony
by one of his alleged victims.</i>

532
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:57,187
Excuse me. Over here.

533
00:48:57,356 --> 00:48:59,051
Excuse me. Can anybody read?

534
00:48:59,491 --> 00:49:03,018
Hey! Sandra!

535
00:49:03,228 --> 00:49:07,164
l want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

536
00:49:07,332 --> 00:49:10,301
We could have,
if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...

537
00:49:10,469 --> 00:49:12,528
-...hadn't thrown things.
-Fuck off.

538
00:49:12,704 --> 00:49:17,698
l cannot believe you're just gonna
let them get away with this shit!

539
00:49:17,876 --> 00:49:20,504
All on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.

540
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:23,648
l don't think you get it, Sandy.

541
00:49:23,815 --> 00:49:25,806
Your princess here
committed perjury.

542
00:49:26,451 --> 00:49:29,750
lt'll be all l can do to keep
her fucking little ass out of jail.

543
00:49:29,921 --> 00:49:32,981
Well, what are we going to do?

544
00:49:41,165 --> 00:49:44,100
-Here's your coffee, Sam.
-Thank you.

545
00:49:57,682 --> 00:49:59,377
Ken.

546
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:13,760
Sorry l'm late.

547
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:15,364
Hold my calls, Lenore.

548
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:17,561
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

549
00:50:40,224 --> 00:50:42,249
Thank you, Sandra.

550
00:50:47,698 --> 00:50:49,598
l'll be seeing you.

551
00:50:49,767 --> 00:50:52,031
-Okay?
-Okay. Yeah.

552
00:50:58,209 --> 00:51:00,439
Nice to see you, Tom.

553
00:51:00,778 --> 00:51:02,370
Come by.
We'll have lunch.

554
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:08,078
See you at the club.

555
00:51:10,321 --> 00:51:12,346
See you at the club.

556
00:51:13,057 --> 00:51:15,218
See you at the club.

557
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:17,417
See you at the club.

558
00:51:18,062 --> 00:51:19,723
See you at the club, Tommy!

559
00:51:19,897 --> 00:51:22,923
Hey, Tom.
What did you shoot today, pal?

560
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,159
Hey, my man!

561
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:29,298
This is for you.

562
00:51:30,341 --> 00:51:32,070
-You did good, Ken.
-Yeah.

563
00:51:32,243 --> 00:51:33,938
Thanks.

564
00:51:35,112 --> 00:51:39,139
l know there's a part of you that wishes
none of this had happened, but it did.

565
00:51:39,317 --> 00:51:42,115
So take the money
and enjoy yourself.

566
00:51:42,286 --> 00:51:45,312
All right? Find a happy place.

567
00:51:45,523 --> 00:51:48,219
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?

568
00:51:48,392 --> 00:51:51,623
-Goodbye, Sam.
-Bye, Lenore.

569
00:52:09,476 --> 00:52:11,910
Take care of my lizards?

570
00:52:20,254 --> 00:52:21,516
Hello, Kelly.

571
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:23,681
Drop dead.

572
00:52:23,857 --> 00:52:28,089
You know how my mom's paying you
off? She's breaking my trust.

573
00:52:28,462 --> 00:52:32,694
l can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.

574
00:52:32,866 --> 00:52:34,128
l'm sorry, Kelly.

575
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:37,293
Why don't you start fucking her
again! You can spend it together!

576
00:52:37,471 --> 00:52:40,133
l hate you! l fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!

577
00:52:40,674 --> 00:52:42,608
l fucking hate you!

578
00:52:54,822 --> 00:52:58,849
You see, Art? l couldn't come back
even if l wanted to.

579
00:53:36,497 --> 00:53:38,556
Goddamn maid.

580
00:54:14,168 --> 00:54:16,102
So you got my mom's money.

581
00:54:17,805 --> 00:54:19,397
How much?

582
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:21,797
How much?

583
00:54:22,543 --> 00:54:24,807
You know how much.

584
00:54:25,045 --> 00:54:26,876
Your turn to pay.

585
00:54:30,084 --> 00:54:33,417
lt worked! We screwed the bitch!

586
00:54:34,254 --> 00:54:36,950
lt worked just like you said.

587
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:39,750
What's wrong?

588
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:43,192
You scared the shit out of me.
What's wrong is your coming here.

589
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,992
That's what's wrong.
Are you fucking crazy?

590
00:54:48,068 --> 00:54:51,469
Yeah, l'm crazy. Ask my mom.

591
00:54:54,808 --> 00:54:58,141
So how much is 8.5 million
divided by three?

592
00:54:59,246 --> 00:55:02,409
Oh, great. Yeah, this is a big joke.
Big joke.

593
00:55:02,583 --> 00:55:06,519
Everyone thinks this is really funny.
Do you think this is fucking over?

594
00:55:06,687 --> 00:55:10,214
Let me tell you something.
lt's a long fucking way from over.

595
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,786
l'm serious.

596
00:55:16,230 --> 00:55:20,189
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.

597
00:55:23,003 --> 00:55:24,527
After tonight?

598
00:55:25,472 --> 00:55:27,235
Yeah, well...

599
00:55:27,775 --> 00:55:29,800
...we're here, aren't we?

600
00:55:32,679 --> 00:55:35,307
So maybe one celebration
is okay...

601
00:55:36,049 --> 00:55:38,210
...if we're in agreement...

602
00:55:39,153 --> 00:55:40,984
...that from here on out...

603
00:55:42,990 --> 00:55:45,754
...you do exactly as l say.

604
00:56:28,268 --> 00:56:31,760
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.

605
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,952
Now l want you two to kiss.

606
00:56:48,589 --> 00:56:50,557
Come on, now.

607
00:56:50,724 --> 00:56:53,818
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.

608
00:58:11,204 --> 00:58:14,571
l told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.

609
00:58:15,175 --> 00:58:18,975
Hey, you're right.
They did make us look stupid.

610
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:21,537
What you're wrong about is why.

611
00:58:22,282 --> 00:58:23,681
All right, hear me out.

612
00:58:24,151 --> 00:58:27,086
Lombardo was having an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan, right?

613
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:28,551
Why not tell us about it?

614
00:58:28,722 --> 00:58:32,055
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.

615
00:58:32,225 --> 00:58:35,319
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.

616
00:58:35,495 --> 00:58:38,828
l thought about it and said: ''You're
Lombardo. Your life is trashed.

617
00:58:38,999 --> 00:58:41,900
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless--''

618
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:43,798
Unless what?

619
00:58:45,739 --> 00:58:49,106
Unless you're setting Sandra
Van Ryan up for the big payday.

620
00:58:49,276 --> 00:58:52,712
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...

621
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:56,815
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl
like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.

622
00:58:56,984 --> 00:58:59,418
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?

623
00:58:59,586 --> 00:59:03,488
Kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.

624
00:59:03,757 --> 00:59:08,057
l'm telling you,
this guy wanted to marry money.

625
00:59:08,795 --> 00:59:12,322
<i>When that didn't happen,
he went to work on these two girls...</i>

626
00:59:12,499 --> 00:59:14,490
<i>...using them to set up
Sandra Van Ryan.</i>

627
00:59:14,668 --> 00:59:16,898
<i>I'm telling you,
they chumped us, partner.</i>

628
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:20,039
<i>They chumped us
right from the start.</i>

629
01:00:14,528 --> 01:00:16,359
Nice stroke.

630
01:00:18,065 --> 01:00:20,056
ls there some reason
why you're here?

631
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:22,497
-Curiosity, l guess.
-About what?

632
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:25,365
How to improve your breast stroke?

633
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:31,003
No. l want to know how you see things
working out for you, Sam and Suzie.

634
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:34,041
Excuse me?

635
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,546
You three gonna
go to the Caribbean together?

636
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,149
Live happily ever after?

637
01:00:38,552 --> 01:00:41,715
You see, the thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.

638
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,150
You're out of your mind.

639
01:00:43,323 --> 01:00:46,656
lt's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.

640
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:49,694
Especially when
two of them are in love.

641
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:54,495
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.

642
01:00:55,469 --> 01:00:56,936
Am l right?

643
01:00:57,104 --> 01:01:00,437
Sam sell you on the idea right up
front of whacking Suzie? Hey!

644
01:01:02,109 --> 01:01:03,940
That's murder, kid.

645
01:01:04,111 --> 01:01:07,274
Police. God, get a life.

646
01:01:08,982 --> 01:01:10,950
You're good, you know that?

647
01:01:12,853 --> 01:01:16,914
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?

648
01:01:38,044 --> 01:01:40,239
Hello, Suzie.

649
01:01:41,114 --> 01:01:42,843
You better watch it
with that shit.

650
01:01:43,016 --> 01:01:45,712
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.

651
01:01:45,886 --> 01:01:48,047
Yeah, or wind up dead.

652
01:01:55,328 --> 01:01:56,955
You know...

653
01:01:58,165 --> 01:02:02,295
...l don't think l ever told you
how sorry l was about your friend.

654
01:02:02,602 --> 01:02:04,502
What was his name?

655
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:11,268
Come on, help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.

656
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:18,180
-Davy.
-Yeah. That's right. Davy.

657
01:02:18,451 --> 01:02:20,578
l was sorry about
the way that worked out.

658
01:02:20,754 --> 01:02:23,552
-That is cop bullshit.
-What was that? What was that?

659
01:02:23,723 --> 01:02:26,692
l don't have to listen to this.
You can't shove me around.

660
01:02:26,860 --> 01:02:29,055
-l have friends now.
-Hey!

661
01:02:29,229 --> 01:02:31,993
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!

662
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,692
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.

663
01:02:40,106 --> 01:02:42,074
Take a look at this.

664
01:02:42,809 --> 01:02:45,277
Go ahead, take it.
lt's not gonna bite you.

665
01:02:45,779 --> 01:02:47,041
Take it!

666
01:02:50,717 --> 01:02:53,880
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.

667
01:02:55,188 --> 01:02:59,249
He transferred the funds to
a numbered offshore account.

668
01:02:59,426 --> 01:03:02,452
Cops don't know the names on it.
Think one of them is yours?

669
01:03:03,430 --> 01:03:07,628
He also put a down payment on island
property and a lease on a sailboat.

670
01:03:07,801 --> 01:03:09,428
You're into sailing, aren't you?

671
01:03:09,603 --> 01:03:12,766
l don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?

672
01:03:12,939 --> 01:03:15,999
l'm telling you this because
l know exactly what's going on.

673
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:20,243
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.

674
01:03:20,413 --> 01:03:22,347
Come on, now.

675
01:03:22,515 --> 01:03:26,110
You don't think Kelly and Sam are
gonna share that money with you.

676
01:03:28,355 --> 01:03:30,346
Leave me alone.

677
01:03:38,832 --> 01:03:40,390
You know...

678
01:03:40,567 --> 01:03:43,263
...l'd want a clear head
right now if l were you...

679
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:48,166
...so l could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.

680
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:52,378
l'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...

681
01:03:52,779 --> 01:03:54,576
...like Davy.

682
01:04:07,127 --> 01:04:08,355
Oh, shit.

683
01:04:14,834 --> 01:04:18,793
<i>You've reached Sam Lombardo.
Wait for the beep, leave a message.</i>

684
01:04:33,787 --> 01:04:37,120
l can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?

685
01:04:37,290 --> 01:04:39,622
l'm scared there's no one to trust.

686
01:04:39,793 --> 01:04:42,125
You can trust me.

687
01:04:48,902 --> 01:04:50,335
Hello?

688
01:04:51,004 --> 01:04:53,564
<i>-Kelly, is Suzie there?
-Yeah.</i>

689
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,708
Christ, l was afraid of that.

690
01:04:55,875 --> 01:04:57,843
She left this insane message.

691
01:04:58,011 --> 01:05:00,479
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...

692
01:05:00,647 --> 01:05:02,945
...and this fucking cop,
she's gonna blow it.

693
01:05:04,184 --> 01:05:05,947
<i>Calm the bitch down.</i>

694
01:05:06,119 --> 01:05:09,088
Why can't you come? Please?

695
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:13,384
Sam, l miss you so much.

696
01:05:15,895 --> 01:05:19,888
l miss you too, Kelly,
but l can't right now.

697
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:22,057
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?

698
01:05:23,136 --> 01:05:25,001
<i>If she can't get a fucking grip....</i>

699
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:28,231
<i>-Then what?
-You know what.</i>

700
01:05:28,875 --> 01:05:30,604
<i>I'll handle it.</i>

701
01:05:30,777 --> 01:05:34,144
But l need you, Kelly.
l need you to be there for me tonight.

702
01:05:35,382 --> 01:05:37,577
<i>-Okay.
-Good.</i>

703
01:05:37,751 --> 01:05:40,618
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know that?

704
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:45,291
<i>Now, put Suzie on the line.
I want you both to hear this.</i>

705
01:05:46,292 --> 01:05:47,987
<i>Suzie.</i>

706
01:05:48,895 --> 01:05:50,556
Sam?

707
01:05:50,730 --> 01:05:52,220
<i>Now, look...</i>

708
01:05:52,399 --> 01:05:55,300
<i>...we gotta stay calm, all of us.</i>

709
01:05:55,468 --> 01:05:58,699
Now, since the settlement,
people think l'm rich...

710
01:05:58,872 --> 01:06:02,239
...so l'm out there spending money,
doing what rich guys do.

711
01:06:02,876 --> 01:06:06,334
<i>This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try
and fuck with you. Don't let him.</i>

712
01:06:06,513 --> 01:06:10,643
<i>-Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
-Suzie, don't fall apart.</i>

713
01:06:10,850 --> 01:06:13,717
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.

714
01:06:22,595 --> 01:06:24,654
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?

715
01:06:24,831 --> 01:06:26,856
Oh, for chrissake.

716
01:06:27,033 --> 01:06:28,523
You are!

717
01:06:28,701 --> 01:06:33,104
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?

718
01:06:33,273 --> 01:06:38,006
That's what l am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.

719
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:40,473
Don't!

720
01:06:44,317 --> 01:06:46,683
You stupid cunt!

721
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:21,251
You are scared, aren't you?

722
01:07:57,972 --> 01:08:01,464
Ray! Jesus Christ!

723
01:08:01,842 --> 01:08:03,833
-Are you crazy?
-Hear her say ''Sam''?

724
01:08:04,145 --> 01:08:07,239
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.

725
01:08:07,415 --> 01:08:09,747
The conversation on the tape
is unintelligible.

726
01:08:09,917 --> 01:08:12,511
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...

727
01:08:12,687 --> 01:08:15,520
-...shooting a porn flick!
-l can't believe this.

728
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:18,625
A month ago, they threw things
at each other in court.

729
01:08:18,793 --> 01:08:21,421
They were acting!
They were all acting!

730
01:08:21,596 --> 01:08:23,427
We bought it, hook, line and sinker.

731
01:08:23,598 --> 01:08:26,533
They're getting away with $8 million
from Sandra Van Ryan.

732
01:08:26,701 --> 01:08:29,397
She might have saved it
if she didn't try to ruin him.

733
01:08:29,570 --> 01:08:32,801
You wouldn't go after a guy
you thought raped your daughter?

734
01:08:32,974 --> 01:08:35,306
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!

735
01:08:35,476 --> 01:08:39,344
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!

736
01:08:39,814 --> 01:08:43,011
l've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep mucking around...

737
01:08:43,184 --> 01:08:45,675
...and she's gonna sue us
for invasion of privacy.

738
01:08:45,853 --> 01:08:48,447
So get out of these people's lives!
Hey! Ray!

739
01:08:49,323 --> 01:08:53,157
-Hey! Am l getting through?
-You think this is just about money?

740
01:08:53,327 --> 01:08:55,454
About us looking stupid?
Question him.

741
01:08:56,564 --> 01:09:00,762
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.

742
01:09:00,935 --> 01:09:02,334
Give him something to do.

743
01:09:02,503 --> 01:09:05,165
-Look into the Kennedy assassination.
-l understand.

744
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:07,864
Next time this fucking piece of shit...

745
01:09:08,042 --> 01:09:10,067
...drags me down here,
l'm gonna sue you.

746
01:09:10,244 --> 01:09:12,576
You're goddamn lucky
l didn't sue last time.

747
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:14,839
-l agree.
-Am l free to go?

748
01:09:15,016 --> 01:09:17,211
-Yes.
-Thank you.

749
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:22,320
-Cocksucker.
-Yeah, what was that?

750
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:26,187
-You heard me, motherfucker.
-Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?

751
01:09:29,864 --> 01:09:31,559
What are you looking at?

752
01:10:15,609 --> 01:10:18,976
-l guess l kind of lost it out there.
-You could say that.

753
01:10:23,384 --> 01:10:26,478
Were you ever in a situation
where you saw something coming...

754
01:10:26,654 --> 01:10:28,986
...and you didn't do
what you could to stop it?

755
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:30,955
We all have.

756
01:10:31,125 --> 01:10:34,993
l mean something bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...

757
01:10:35,563 --> 01:10:38,794
...and you--
You didn't do anything, and....

758
01:10:42,903 --> 01:10:44,734
l did that once.

759
01:10:46,741 --> 01:10:48,868
l don't wanna do it again.

760
01:11:07,695 --> 01:11:09,993
l thought we were going to a movie.

761
01:11:12,366 --> 01:11:15,301
l think we just need to get wasted.

762
01:11:15,936 --> 01:11:17,597
Yeah.

763
01:11:35,422 --> 01:11:36,980
Come on.

764
01:11:43,798 --> 01:11:46,460
l wanna live at the beach someday.

765
01:11:46,801 --> 01:11:48,496
Oh, shit.

766
01:11:48,669 --> 01:11:51,365
l left the keys.

767
01:11:51,539 --> 01:11:53,097
l'll get them.

768
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:14,258
Kelly?

769
01:12:14,428 --> 01:12:16,055
Suzie.

770
01:12:18,566 --> 01:12:20,329
lt's me.

771
01:12:25,139 --> 01:12:28,108
l was worried about you,
and l decided...

772
01:12:28,275 --> 01:12:32,541
...the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.

773
01:12:33,147 --> 01:12:36,082
-Are you mad at me?
-No, no.

774
01:12:36,250 --> 01:12:38,684
l probably should've told you
a bit more about...

775
01:12:38,853 --> 01:12:41,151
...the part l intended to play.

776
01:12:41,322 --> 01:12:43,256
But we'll go through it again tonight.

777
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:51,487
This is a celebration, Suzie,
not a suicide pact.

778
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:55,601
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...

779
01:12:55,769 --> 01:12:58,294
...have a little champagne...

780
01:12:58,472 --> 01:13:00,269
...watch the stars....

781
01:13:01,375 --> 01:13:02,706
Kelly?

782
01:13:02,877 --> 01:13:05,539
You got a blanket in the back
of your mom's Rover?

783
01:13:06,647 --> 01:13:09,639
Why don't you be an angel
and run over and get it for us?

784
01:13:12,253 --> 01:13:13,914
Good girl.

785
01:13:15,556 --> 01:13:18,081
Let me tell you about the boat
l picked out for us.

786
01:14:21,422 --> 01:14:23,117
You okay?

787
01:14:24,658 --> 01:14:27,957
My mom would kill me
if she knew l took the Rover.

788
01:15:05,021 --> 01:15:07,182
So you say she didn't
come home last night.

789
01:15:07,357 --> 01:15:11,657
She's been talking about going to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.

790
01:15:11,828 --> 01:15:14,888
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.

791
01:15:17,667 --> 01:15:20,795
Found some teeth in an old trailer
down the road.

792
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:23,029
He says they'll fit.

793
01:15:23,506 --> 01:15:27,169
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.

794
01:15:27,343 --> 01:15:31,040
Oh, and now they're saying
that she can't graduate.

795
01:15:31,214 --> 01:15:35,275
lt is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her
into this whole mess, and you know it.

796
01:15:35,452 --> 01:15:37,647
Well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.

797
01:15:37,821 --> 01:15:40,813
We find something,
you'll be the first to know.

798
01:15:42,292 --> 01:15:43,691
Come on.

799
01:16:02,145 --> 01:16:04,545
lt's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.

800
01:16:04,714 --> 01:16:07,842
Ray, we don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.

801
01:16:08,017 --> 01:16:10,508
l'll drop you off.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.

802
01:16:10,687 --> 01:16:12,314
You got someplace you wanna be?

803
01:16:13,156 --> 01:16:16,387
-You got a date?
-Just check the car out for me.

804
01:16:26,136 --> 01:16:28,468
lt's over here, by that old boat.

805
01:16:29,572 --> 01:16:32,234
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?

806
01:16:32,408 --> 01:16:34,308
Yeah, sometimes.

807
01:16:34,477 --> 01:16:36,911
A lot of the kids hang out here.

808
01:16:38,515 --> 01:16:41,245
You really think something bad
happened to Suzie?

809
01:16:41,784 --> 01:16:43,979
Lombardo ever come out here?

810
01:16:46,256 --> 01:16:47,985
l say something funny?

811
01:16:48,158 --> 01:16:52,356
No, but l mean, just the idea
that Mr. Lombardo would--

812
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:56,090
Well, the way l heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.

813
01:16:56,266 --> 01:16:57,790
You and him were pals, right?

814
01:16:57,967 --> 01:17:01,232
Yeah, but he got me
onto the sailing team.

815
01:17:01,404 --> 01:17:04,373
Told me l could work my way
through college, like he did.

816
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:08,443
Sam Lombardo went to the University
of Miami on an athletic scholarship.

817
01:17:08,611 --> 01:17:12,570
Boats didn't have a damn thing
to do with it.

818
01:18:03,132 --> 01:18:05,123
Listen, l'm gonna be here a while, kid.

819
01:18:05,301 --> 01:18:08,134
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?

820
01:18:13,977 --> 01:18:15,604
Hey, Jimmy.

821
01:18:17,814 --> 01:18:22,251
People aren't always what they
appear to be. Don't forget that.

822
01:18:39,702 --> 01:18:42,000
-This is where they did it.
-Where's the body?

823
01:18:42,171 --> 01:18:44,264
The swamp, most likely.
Guy's a swamp rat.

824
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,931
He knows it won't be found,
but he made a mistake.

825
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:50,910
She'd been threatening to run away
and l found the car at the bus terminal.

826
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:52,775
You don't think Sam put it there?

827
01:18:52,949 --> 01:18:56,180
Hold on a second.
Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.

828
01:18:56,352 --> 01:18:59,753
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.

829
01:18:59,922 --> 01:19:02,117
Little sociopath's the one
who started this.

830
01:19:02,292 --> 01:19:05,352
-How long till we get something?
-We can get blood type now.

831
01:19:05,528 --> 01:19:09,020
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.

832
01:19:10,633 --> 01:19:12,624
Poor, dumb Suzie.
Kid never had a chance.

833
01:19:12,802 --> 01:19:15,464
-We don't know that.
-l'm telling you, Kelly's next.

834
01:19:15,638 --> 01:19:19,438
l'm telling you, you get
off this right now.

835
01:19:19,709 --> 01:19:23,873
Don't even fucking let me hear
about you bothering Lombardo.

836
01:19:27,350 --> 01:19:28,840
David!

837
01:19:29,018 --> 01:19:31,384
You get an lD, you call me!

838
01:19:33,756 --> 01:19:34,984
Will you do me a favor?

839
01:19:36,192 --> 01:19:37,784
Ray, you heard him.

840
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:40,929
He told me to stay away.
He didn't say anything about you.

841
01:19:41,097 --> 01:19:43,588
What if l'm right and Hunter's wrong?

842
01:19:43,766 --> 01:19:46,234
Please, you gotta help me out
on this, partner.

843
01:19:46,636 --> 01:19:49,935
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?

844
01:19:51,207 --> 01:19:55,109
lf l'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.

845
01:20:38,554 --> 01:20:41,284
<i>-Hello?
-I've been calling you.</i>

846
01:20:41,457 --> 01:20:43,254
<i>-l wanna see you.
-Where are you?</i>

847
01:20:43,426 --> 01:20:46,088
<i>-The stupid guest house.
-Good. Stay there.</i>

848
01:20:46,262 --> 01:20:48,059
Sam, l'm really nervous.

849
01:20:48,564 --> 01:20:50,828
Kelly, relax.

850
01:20:51,134 --> 01:20:53,602
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.

851
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:57,467
ln a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.

852
01:20:57,640 --> 01:20:59,767
But what if they find out?

853
01:21:00,076 --> 01:21:02,806
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.

854
01:21:02,979 --> 01:21:04,412
<i>Look, Kelly...</i>

855
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:07,481
...stay in the guest house,
skip the graduation parties.

856
01:21:07,917 --> 01:21:10,181
l love you so much.

857
01:21:10,353 --> 01:21:12,321
<i>And I love you too, Kelly.</i>

858
01:21:12,488 --> 01:21:14,456
<i>Be a good girl
and stay where you are.</i>

859
01:21:37,613 --> 01:21:40,104
Peeping in people's windows?

860
01:21:40,783 --> 01:21:42,216
lsn't that against the law?

861
01:21:44,086 --> 01:21:45,849
Suzie Toller's missing.

862
01:21:46,923 --> 01:21:49,551
-Since when?
-She didn't come home last night.

863
01:21:49,892 --> 01:21:52,690
We found her car
at the bus terminal.

864
01:21:52,962 --> 01:21:54,657
Ray thinks she was murdered.

865
01:21:55,398 --> 01:21:57,525
Well, l don't know what to tell you.

866
01:21:59,268 --> 01:22:02,135
You could tell me
where you were last night.

867
01:22:02,638 --> 01:22:05,903
l suppose l could,
but l don't really have to, now, do l?

868
01:22:09,011 --> 01:22:10,239
Come here.

869
01:22:11,581 --> 01:22:13,708
l wanna show you something.

870
01:22:24,961 --> 01:22:27,020
Looks like goodbye.

871
01:22:27,697 --> 01:22:29,460
Kelly's file.

872
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:33,465
Read it. You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...

873
01:22:33,636 --> 01:22:36,161
...who threatened the lives
of at least two people.

874
01:22:36,339 --> 01:22:37,772
What two people?

875
01:22:37,940 --> 01:22:40,135
One of them was her mother.

876
01:22:40,376 --> 01:22:42,367
The other one was...

877
01:22:43,746 --> 01:22:45,270
...a female classmate...

878
01:22:46,883 --> 01:22:49,545
...she may have been
sexually involved with.

879
01:22:50,653 --> 01:22:52,177
Suzie?

880
01:22:53,856 --> 01:22:55,824
Now you got the file.

881
01:22:56,325 --> 01:22:57,758
Read it.

882
01:22:58,594 --> 01:23:01,757
l think it'll give you a new
perspective on things.

883
01:23:02,899 --> 01:23:06,266
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?

884
01:23:08,304 --> 01:23:11,102
Because then l had principles.

885
01:23:11,274 --> 01:23:13,105
That meant a lot to me.

886
01:23:15,144 --> 01:23:16,577
Now...

887
01:23:18,047 --> 01:23:19,981
...l don't care.

888
01:23:34,063 --> 01:23:36,327
l should probably go now.

889
01:23:38,968 --> 01:23:41,937
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.

890
01:24:09,398 --> 01:24:12,390
<i>-Duquette. What's happening?
-I'm tired. I'm going home.</i>

891
01:24:12,568 --> 01:24:14,058
<i>-Where's Lombardo?
-He's gone.</i>

892
01:24:14,236 --> 01:24:17,433
Goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.

893
01:24:17,607 --> 01:24:19,666
Let me tell you something, Ray:

894
01:24:19,842 --> 01:24:21,867
There's more to this story
than you know.

895
01:24:22,044 --> 01:24:23,602
<i>If Suzie is dead...</i>

896
01:24:23,779 --> 01:24:26,213
...Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.

897
01:24:28,417 --> 01:24:29,941
Ray?

898
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,554
Shit, Ray.

899
01:24:42,865 --> 01:24:45,993
<i>-Who is it?
-lt's Detective Duquette.</i>

900
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:48,033
Open the gate, now.

901
01:25:19,402 --> 01:25:21,563
-Hello, Kelly.
-What are you doing here?

902
01:25:39,855 --> 01:25:43,291
Where's--? Kelly! Kelly!

903
01:25:50,866 --> 01:25:54,632
l just looked away for a second,
just a split second.

904
01:25:54,937 --> 01:25:57,735
And just like that, bingo...

905
01:25:58,074 --> 01:26:00,269
...she put a knee in my groin.

906
01:26:00,443 --> 01:26:03,241
l didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...

907
01:26:03,746 --> 01:26:05,475
...just enough.

908
01:26:06,048 --> 01:26:08,073
l couldn't get to her.

909
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:10,943
She turned on me with the gun.

910
01:26:13,089 --> 01:26:15,250
Fired one shot.

911
01:26:16,258 --> 01:26:17,885
l took the hit in the shoulder.

912
01:26:21,263 --> 01:26:23,197
l had no choice.

913
01:26:27,069 --> 01:26:28,400
l had to return fire.

914
01:26:30,139 --> 01:26:33,734
Two rounds, l think,
in the chest.

915
01:26:37,480 --> 01:26:39,744
l went there to protect her.

916
01:26:42,585 --> 01:26:45,145
l went-- l went there to protect her.

917
01:26:45,321 --> 01:26:47,050
Detective Duquette.

918
01:26:47,223 --> 01:26:50,750
l spent time in military intelligence,
and we had a saying there:

919
01:26:50,926 --> 01:26:54,191
''Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

920
01:26:54,363 --> 01:26:56,456
Three times is enemy action.''

921
01:26:56,632 --> 01:26:58,657
This is twice for you, Duquette...

922
01:26:58,834 --> 01:27:02,133
...and l intend to see to it
that there is no third time.

923
01:27:02,605 --> 01:27:06,473
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.

924
01:27:06,642 --> 01:27:09,372
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.

925
01:27:09,545 --> 01:27:12,412
Consequently,
two young women are dead.

926
01:27:13,015 --> 01:27:17,076
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.

927
01:27:17,253 --> 01:27:18,914
Chief Goodsall...

928
01:27:19,088 --> 01:27:23,320
...Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...

929
01:27:23,492 --> 01:27:25,960
...near the area known as
Stoner Beach.

930
01:27:26,128 --> 01:27:29,359
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.

931
01:27:29,532 --> 01:27:32,524
This has led this office to conclude...

932
01:27:32,868 --> 01:27:36,326
...that Susan Marie Toller was
murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.

933
01:27:37,506 --> 01:27:39,838
She--
She didn't.

934
01:27:42,278 --> 01:27:43,973
Mr. Duquette.

935
01:27:44,446 --> 01:27:46,107
Mr. Duquette.

936
01:27:46,549 --> 01:27:50,178
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.

937
01:28:16,545 --> 01:28:18,274
Thank you, Paul.

938
01:29:13,035 --> 01:29:14,263
Howdy, partner.

939
01:29:16,171 --> 01:29:20,039
Jesus, man. l wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

940
01:29:23,779 --> 01:29:25,679
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.

941
01:29:25,848 --> 01:29:28,339
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.

942
01:29:28,517 --> 01:29:30,417
The bitch shot me.

943
01:29:30,586 --> 01:29:34,078
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?

944
01:29:34,256 --> 01:29:36,747
You know, shoot them
in the leg or something?

945
01:29:36,926 --> 01:29:40,259
Did you become squeamish
about this stuff before or after...

946
01:29:40,429 --> 01:29:43,660
...you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?

947
01:29:43,832 --> 01:29:47,290
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
lt wasn't part of the plan.

948
01:29:47,469 --> 01:29:51,963
lt couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.

949
01:29:52,141 --> 01:29:53,972
l couldn't talk them out of it.

950
01:29:54,143 --> 01:29:56,134
l'm telling you,
l don't like surprises.

951
01:29:56,345 --> 01:30:00,281
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.

952
01:30:00,449 --> 01:30:02,383
Now there's no loose ends.

953
01:30:02,551 --> 01:30:06,043
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.

954
01:30:06,221 --> 01:30:09,713
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...

955
01:30:10,159 --> 01:30:13,856
...l spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...

956
01:30:15,064 --> 01:30:16,861
...to make the transfer, so....

957
01:30:17,032 --> 01:30:18,556
-Bullshit.
-Oh, yeah.

958
01:30:18,734 --> 01:30:20,429
Call them yourself.

959
01:30:20,836 --> 01:30:24,932
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.

960
01:30:25,107 --> 01:30:29,134
We'll take out the boat.
l just had it outfitted.

961
01:30:29,712 --> 01:30:31,577
l could use a deck hand.

962
01:30:37,019 --> 01:30:39,487
Here's to large bank accounts.

963
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:45,382
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.

964
01:30:48,697 --> 01:30:51,860
To large accounts
and no loose ends.

965
01:30:52,768 --> 01:30:54,633
And no loose ends.

966
01:31:13,022 --> 01:31:15,923
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?

967
01:31:17,426 --> 01:31:19,690
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.

968
01:31:24,433 --> 01:31:26,094
-You mean that thing?
-Yeah, Ray.

969
01:31:26,268 --> 01:31:30,398
We call it a winch.
lt's what we use to tighten the sails.

970
01:31:30,572 --> 01:31:34,702
-So why don't you start cranking?
-This is supposed to be a vacation.

971
01:31:34,877 --> 01:31:36,868
Why don't you get a nice powerboat?

972
01:31:37,546 --> 01:31:40,208
Come on, Ray.
l'll make a sailor out of you yet.

973
01:31:41,150 --> 01:31:42,981
Or get me drowned.

974
01:31:57,099 --> 01:31:58,327
lt's stuck.

975
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,731
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Put a little elbow grease in it.

976
01:32:06,008 --> 01:32:07,600
lt's stuck, l'm telling you.

977
01:32:09,478 --> 01:32:11,742
The jenny sheet must be
caught on something.

978
01:32:11,914 --> 01:32:15,179
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?

979
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:18,842
-l don't understand a word you said.
-Okay, Ray.

980
01:32:19,021 --> 01:32:21,990
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...

981
01:32:22,157 --> 01:32:24,785
...and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.

982
01:32:26,562 --> 01:32:28,120
You're killing me.

983
01:32:36,872 --> 01:32:40,831
-You mean this thing?
-That's it. That one right there.

984
01:32:41,243 --> 01:32:43,234
You see anything?

985
01:32:46,181 --> 01:32:48,046
Look a little lower.

986
01:32:48,317 --> 01:32:49,545
That's it.

987
01:32:58,627 --> 01:33:01,152
Guess l forgot to tell you, Ray:

988
01:33:02,865 --> 01:33:05,356
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.

989
01:33:05,767 --> 01:33:07,894
First rule of sailing.

990
01:33:33,195 --> 01:33:34,457
Ray!

991
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:37,258
-What happened?
-Nice try, motherfucker!

992
01:33:46,408 --> 01:33:48,035
You!

993
01:33:48,677 --> 01:33:50,668
You're dead!

994
01:33:50,879 --> 01:33:52,346
No, l'm not.

995
01:33:55,017 --> 01:33:56,450
Sam.

996
01:33:56,618 --> 01:34:00,110
-Sam, for chrissake!
-Sorry, partner.

997
01:34:00,289 --> 01:34:02,849
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.

998
01:34:03,025 --> 01:34:06,392
You shouldn't have killed that kid
out in the glades either.

999
01:34:06,562 --> 01:34:09,395
-What was his name?
-Davy.

1000
01:34:22,544 --> 01:34:24,171
That's my son, Walter.

1001
01:34:24,346 --> 01:34:29,443
He's been doing this a long time,
so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.

1002
01:34:29,618 --> 01:34:33,019
Thank you so much
for coming down to the glades.

1003
01:34:46,001 --> 01:34:50,904
Did you come here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?

1004
01:34:51,173 --> 01:34:53,334
No. Actually, it's my day off.

1005
01:34:55,177 --> 01:34:56,906
l thought you looked different.

1006
01:34:57,079 --> 01:34:59,639
l came because l was hoping
you would talk to me.

1007
01:35:01,183 --> 01:35:02,480
About Suzie?

1008
01:35:02,651 --> 01:35:06,417
Actually, l was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.

1009
01:35:11,860 --> 01:35:14,385
He used to come around here.

1010
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:18,597
He had a thing going
with one of the girls--

1011
01:35:18,767 --> 01:35:22,328
Girls. Over at the glades.

1012
01:35:23,171 --> 01:35:26,766
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what l hear.

1013
01:35:27,509 --> 01:35:31,240
-She still work there?
-Not after that night.

1014
01:35:31,813 --> 01:35:33,974
All l know is, the next morning...

1015
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:38,085
...she was gone and a boy was dead.

1016
01:35:38,253 --> 01:35:43,691
Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.

1017
01:35:47,062 --> 01:35:51,328
Caught Ray slapping her around,
and he tried to stop it.

1018
01:35:52,334 --> 01:35:55,201
So Ray killed him.

1019
01:35:55,971 --> 01:35:58,201
Suzie saw it.

1020
01:35:58,540 --> 01:36:02,408
So he busted her and sent her up.

1021
01:36:02,577 --> 01:36:07,241
You know, just to prove that he could.

1022
01:36:07,983 --> 01:36:11,043
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.

1023
01:36:22,197 --> 01:36:24,165
To Ray.

1024
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:28,162
We won. Sam, it's over.

1025
01:36:35,644 --> 01:36:39,978
Wow. Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.

1026
01:36:40,148 --> 01:36:44,346
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before l can get rid of you.

1027
01:36:55,997 --> 01:36:57,396
Okay, Toller.

1028
01:36:57,566 --> 01:37:00,296
l wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.

1029
01:37:01,203 --> 01:37:05,071
-Fuck the winch. l wanna drive.
-lt doesn't work that way.

1030
01:37:05,240 --> 01:37:07,367
You don't drive it, you sail it.

1031
01:37:08,377 --> 01:37:10,572
Now, get on that winch.

1032
01:37:11,713 --> 01:37:14,614
l just wanna cruise for a while.

1033
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:22,816
That's funny. That's one of the first
things l noticed about you, Sam.

1034
01:37:22,991 --> 01:37:25,892
You like to cruise.

1035
01:37:27,529 --> 01:37:31,397
-Suzie.
-Take college, for instance.

1036
01:37:31,566 --> 01:37:36,560
l bet the classes you took were ones
where the finals were multiple choice.

1037
01:37:37,339 --> 01:37:41,002
And you never bought the book.
You'd find a girl to loan you hers.

1038
01:37:41,176 --> 01:37:44,907
And then, of course, you'd have
to fuck her after that, right?

1039
01:37:45,080 --> 01:37:46,570
ls that how it went?

1040
01:37:49,551 --> 01:37:51,018
Yeah.

1041
01:37:53,388 --> 01:37:56,221
Well, l've got a good pop quiz for you.

1042
01:37:56,391 --> 01:37:58,484
Multiple choice, of course.

1043
01:37:59,828 --> 01:38:01,489
<i>Before sailing on the Helios...</i>

1044
01:38:01,663 --> 01:38:07,260
...Medea killed King Creon
and the princess with what?

1045
01:38:07,736 --> 01:38:09,363
A rock?

1046
01:38:10,272 --> 01:38:12,001
A spear gun?

1047
01:38:14,042 --> 01:38:15,600
Or a little poison?

1048
01:38:16,478 --> 01:38:18,571
Poison!

1049
01:38:22,384 --> 01:38:23,942
Good guess.

1050
01:38:55,983 --> 01:38:57,848
Nice truck.

1051
01:39:05,826 --> 01:39:07,589
Selling your boat?

1052
01:39:12,666 --> 01:39:14,964
This was Suzie's boat.

1053
01:39:15,636 --> 01:39:18,127
Guess she won't be needing it now.

1054
01:39:19,940 --> 01:39:24,001
Funny. l wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.

1055
01:39:26,380 --> 01:39:30,544
Old lady had her tested once.
They said her lQ was way up there.

1056
01:39:30,718 --> 01:39:34,586
Around 200 or some such shit.

1057
01:39:34,755 --> 01:39:38,247
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.

1058
01:40:47,236 --> 01:40:48,760
You know...

1059
01:40:48,938 --> 01:40:52,430
...that weekend l got busted,
l called you about a hundred times.

1060
01:40:57,113 --> 01:41:01,049
l really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.

1061
01:41:03,385 --> 01:41:04,682
Was l naive.

1062
01:41:09,191 --> 01:41:11,250
l can't decide what came out better.

1063
01:41:11,427 --> 01:41:16,797
That little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dildo shoved up her ass.

1064
01:41:17,967 --> 01:41:20,458
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

1065
01:41:34,784 --> 01:41:37,218
Seems to like the same places you do.

1066
01:41:37,753 --> 01:41:42,315
-Funny you never met.
-Yeah, real funny.

1067
01:41:42,491 --> 01:41:46,951
You know, you're wrong about this,
and l could get busted on the spot.

1068
01:41:47,930 --> 01:41:52,594
Trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it.
Especially the part about killing me.

1069
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:56,226
Now, get out of here.
Go make yourself a new friend.

1070
01:42:08,484 --> 01:42:10,645
What are you drinking?

1071
01:42:23,528 --> 01:42:27,624
You got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the evidence.

1072
01:42:32,170 --> 01:42:34,832
Oh, for chrissake.

1073
01:42:49,888 --> 01:42:52,288
-Hello, Kelly.
-What are you doing here?

1074
01:43:39,404 --> 01:43:41,304
May l ask you a question, Ms. Toller?

1075
01:43:43,841 --> 01:43:47,004
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?

1076
01:43:49,714 --> 01:43:51,579
l hope l never make you mad.

1077
01:43:55,520 --> 01:43:58,182
Cash is just walking-around money.

1078
01:43:58,823 --> 01:44:01,018
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...

1079
01:44:01,192 --> 01:44:03,660
...minus the million we set aside
for Ruby and Walter...

1080
01:44:03,828 --> 01:44:05,489
...less my usual fee.

1081
01:44:07,398 --> 01:44:09,059
Case closed.

1082
01:44:21,245 --> 01:44:23,042
Suzie.

1083
01:44:25,683 --> 01:44:27,674
Be good.
