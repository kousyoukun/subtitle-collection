00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,912
你有空的時候
lf you weren't so busy chasing booty...

135
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,176
和我一起來打魚，你可以親手抓一條
...you'd have come with me and caught one for yourself.

136
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,752
別說你要吃這東西
Don't tell me you're gonna eat this thing.

137
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,183
為啥?
Why not?

138
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,950
這是梭魚，有毒，毒死你
lt's a barracuda. lt's poisonous. lt'll kill you.

139
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,652
操，我可以對跟你約會的女人說這個
Shit, man, l could say that about most of the girls you date.

140
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,956
桑德拉·范·賴安 電話找 薩姆
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

141
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,634
-桑德拉，什麼事? -凱利 今天蹺課了，薩姆.
-Sandra, what's up? -Kelly skipped school today, Sam.

142
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,334
你聽到什麼了?
Have you heard anything?

143
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,006
沒有
Not a word.

144
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,206
別擔心
Never mind.

145
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,813
我找到她了
l found her.

146
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,384
好
Pull!

147
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:47,692
聽著，薩姆，上次真不錯
Listen, Sam, it was really good seeing you the other day.

148
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,229
桑德拉，我現在很忙 不如--
Sandra, l'm real busy right now, so--

149
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,332
對我這隻船來說沒人開得比你好
l haven't found anyone who can handle my boat the way you can.

150
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,234
-是的，好吧-- -我知道你正在操 芭芭拉巴克斯特
-Yeah, well-- -l know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.

151
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:05,136
-那又怎樣? -好吧 也許我只能跟一個女人在一起
-So what? -So maybe l'm a one-woman man now.

152
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,841
可憐的 薩姆.
Aw, poor Sam.

153
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,348
你真想找一個藍灣女人嫁給你?
Really think you'll get one of these Blue Bay women to marry you?

154
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,814
-講完啦？桑德拉? -抓住關鍵，親愛的.
-Are you finished, Sandra? -Grab a clue, honey.

155
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,152
你是收費的 床上工夫不錯 向來不錯
You're a hired hand, a good lay. That's as far as it goes.

156
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,590
好好享受吧，趁現在還行
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

157
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,695
再見，桑德拉
Goodbye, Sandra.

158
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,065
放!
Pull!

159
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,700
你似乎把槍當心理醫生啦
You seem to find guns therapeutic.

160
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,965
也許我該試一下
Maybe l ought to try it.

161
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,577
好吧，讓我來猜猜
So let me guess.

162
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,579
整個週末某個男孩子都沒來惹你
Some boy didn't call and screwed up your whole weekend.

163
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,946
白白過一天?對不對?
So you're taking the day off. Right?

164
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,754
那又是你的哪個水手?
Which one of your deck hands is that?

165
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,189
管他哪個，只要是我想要的
Whichever one l want.

166
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,355
好吧，凱利，發生什麼事了?
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

167
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,327
怎麼了?
What is it?

168
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,831
我想爸爸
l miss Dad.

169
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,406
上帝
Jesus.

170
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,645
我也想他，有時候吧
l miss him too, sometimes.

171
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,111
你才不會
No, you don't.

172
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,981
他不應該自殺，凱利
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

173
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,224
哦，凱利…
Oh, Kelly....

174
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,399
我不知道他為什麼要這麼做
l don't know why he did it.

175
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,464
我真的不知道
l really don't.

176
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,205
我能幫你什麼嗎?
Can l--?

177
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,649
我能幫你什麼嗎?
Can l get you anything?

178
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,944
鎮靜片?
Do you want a Valium?

179
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,424
我被強姦了
l was raped.

180
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:07,063
什麼，親愛的? 我沒聽清楚
-What, honey? l can't hear you. -l said, l was raped.

181
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,928
什麼?
What?

182
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,233
我是說，我被強姦了
l was raped...

183
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,067
…被 薩姆 倫巴多強姦了
...by Sam Lombardo.

184
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,980
薩姆 倫巴多?
Sam Lombardo?

185
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,017
我的女兒… 在藍灣有人敢強姦!
My daughter does not get raped in Blue Bay!

186
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,845
你是說薩姆 倫巴多 強姦了她?
And you're saying that Sam Lombardo raped her?

187
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:33,857
那個混蛋敢對我女兒做這種事， 一定是在發昏
That son of a bitch must be insane to think he can do this to me.

188
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:37,429
我們知道您心情，范·賴安夫人…
We understand your feelings, Miss Van Ryan...

189
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,657
…不過 我們還是要先跟 凱利談下
...but please, we need some time with Kelly.

190
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,993
我們最好記錄她的單方陳述
We'd like to take her statement alone.

191
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,664
- 你準備好啦? - 好吧
-Are you all right with this, baby? -Yeah.

192
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,333
好
Okay.

193
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,114
要不要再等一下?
Would you like to take a break for a minute?

194
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:06,949
我只想快點兒結束
l just wanna get it over with.

195
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,853
我們得錄下這些陳訴
We'd like to videotape this statement.

196
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:14,467
我知道這個不好受，凱利 但這是很嚴重的指控…
l know this isn't pleasant, Kelly, but these are serious charges...

197
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:19,162
所以我們要知道你兩個之間發生的每一件事
...and we need to know everything that happened between the two of you.

198
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,133
準備好了嗎?
Are you ready?

199
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,876
他先是抓住我的肩膀
He started rubbing my shoulders.

200
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,022
我讓他--
I let him.

201
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,716
我是說，他的確討人喜歡…
I mean, he's a nice guy.

202
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,093
然後呢…
The next thing...

203
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:48,197
他的手在我短褲裏--.
...his hand was in my shorts.

204
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,470
這個，從後面.
You know, from behind.

205
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,609
他的手指….
His fingers....

206
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:01,743
-他的手指… -說清楚…
-His fingers.... -Take your time.

207
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,419
他把手指放進去--.
They were in me.

208
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,484
兩個地方，你知道?
Both places, you know?

209
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,119
他進入你的身體了嗎?
Did he put himself inside you?

210
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,853
是的.
Yes.

211
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,691
我說「不要.」 我尖叫.
I said ''Stop. '' I screamed.

212
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,892
我頭腦一片空白只有這個聲音在叫
I mean, that's how it sounded in my head.

213
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,299
他傷害我.
He hurt me.

214
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,964
你反抗過?
Did you try to fight him?

215
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,477
他把我的手腕扭在背後.
Well, he had my wrists pinned behind me.

216
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,046
然後怎樣?
Then what?

217
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:39,447
他一直在說，來吧來吧.
He kept saying, ''Let it happen.

218
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,719
來吧.
Let it happen. ''

219
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,720
然後他突然停下來.
And then he just stopped.

220
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,084
你是說，他離開啦?
You mean he withdrew?

221
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,628
我不知道，很難講清楚
I don't know. It's really hard to remember, exactly.

222
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:53,992
儘量想想，凱利.
Try, Kelly.

223
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,397
我只記得他在說 .
I know one thing he said.

224
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:06,570
他說，「不要怕. 我沒有射.」
He said, ''Don't worry. I didn't come. ''

225
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,038
我忘不了那些話.
I can't forget that.

226
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,614
他說:小女孩不能給我高潮.
He said, ''No little girl can ever make me come. ''

227
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:21,918
小女孩不能給我高潮.  上帝
''No little girl can ever make me come.'' Jesus.

228
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:25,155
還真壞.我們得搞一點物證
Too bad. We might have had some physical evidence.

229
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,661
怎麼了?
What?

230
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:32,669
也許根本沒有物證，因為也許什麼都沒發生
Maybe there's no physical evidence because nothing happened.

231
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,435
知道我的想法?我覺得她在演戲
You want my gut? There it is. l think she's acting.

232
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,943
我覺得是她找機會跟他單獨在一起，希望他能搞點事情
l think she set it up to be alone with him so he'd come on to her.

233
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:42,775
她很失望 因為他不肯做
She's upset because he didn't.

234
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,645
也許她是那樣計畫的. 也許不是
Maybe she set it up that way. Maybe not.

235
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,685
那傢伙應該讓讓她站那兒別動
The guy never should've had her there in the first place.

236
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,915
我掌握的情況是，他幹過藍灣半數的女人
The line l have on him, he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

237
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,321
但這個不能把他變成強姦犯
That doesn't make him a rapist.

238
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,787
對她使用測謊儀怎樣?
What about asking her to take a polygraph?

239
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:59,295
讓主教大人做個尿檢怎樣？
What about asking the pope to take a piss test?

240
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,898
這裏是藍灣.，格洛裏亞
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.

241
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:05,766
讓范·賴安家的人測謊，湯姆巴克斯特 還不得砍你
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

242
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:09,136
你害怕湯姆巴克斯特? 你害怕桑德拉·范·賴安?
You afraid of Tom Baxter now? You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

243
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,403
討論結束，你們倆知道該怎麼做
End of discussion. You both know what to do.

244
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,742
調查他的鄰居，同事， 再跟凱利的朋友談談
Start with his neighbors, coworkers. Talk to Kelly's friends.

245
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:18,679
-你知道那對他意味著什麼. -是的
-You know what that'll mean for him. -Yeah.

246
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:24,050
你也聽到凱利的指控了. 這傢伙是混蛋.給我把案卷搞出來
And you heard Kelly's statement. The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.

247
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,007
好
All right.

248
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,042
幹得好，紀姆波 星期一見
Good work, Jimbo. l'll see you Monday.

249
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:21,544
好
All right.

250
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,049
他是我航海課的標兵
That's what's left of my sailing class.

251
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,391
跟我說吧，阿蒂
Talk to me, Artie.

252
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,727
凱利 范·賴安指控你強姦她
Kelly Van Ryan is accusing you of rape.

253
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,530
吉米告訴我的
Jimmy told me.

254
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,335
很顯然，我是最後一個知道的
Apparently, l'm the last one to know about it.

255
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:48,474
薩姆，我…
Sam, l....

256
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,775
桑德拉·范·賴安一整天都在做大喇叭…
Sandra Van Ryan has been on the horn all day...

257
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,037
跟學校當局的每一個人訴說
...with every member of the school board.

258
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,680
她在努力讓你停職
She's pushing for suspension.

259
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:59,682
難道校方只聽她的一面之辭，卻不聽聽我的?
And the board's just gonna roll over for her without hearing my side?

260
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:03,652
真是昏頭啦. 我是清白的，該死的
This is insane. l'm innocent, goddamn it.

261
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,290
你要相信我
You gotta believe that.

262
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,688
我能告訴你的就是那事就這樣掛著
All l can tell you, Sam, is hang in there.

263
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,851
他們相信你，一切都會恢復照舊的--
They clear you, you get reinstated--

264
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,691
你不明白這種事
You never get clear of something like this.

265
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,824
它會跟著你
lt stays with you.

266
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:19,438
一直都會跟著你
lt follows you around forever.

267
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,403
你需要有人幫助
You're gonna need some help, Sam.

268
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,536
你需要一位元律師
You're gonna need an attorney.

269
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:29,079
或者你能夠告訴我在南佛羅里達還有個律師…
Right. And maybe you can tell me which attorney in South Florida...

270
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,240
想在法庭上和范·賴安家族作對
...is gonna wanna go up against the Van Ryans in court.

271
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,729
我找肯·寶登
l'm here to see Ken Bowden.

272
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,966
-你有預約? -是的
-Do you have an appointment? -Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.

273
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,236
好，然後
Okay, then.

274
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,970
好的
Mr. Bowden, your 1 0:30's here.

275
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,116
請帶他進來
Will you show him in, please?

276
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,986
是什麼事讓你跑到城的這頭來的?
What brings you to this part of town?

277
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:12,083
好吧，我呢，直到昨天…
Well, l was, until yesterday...

278
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,250
我還是藍灣高中的法律輔導員
...a guidance counselor at Blue Bay High School.

279
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,188
那兒的一個學生指控我強姦
A student there is accusing me of rape.

280
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,231
男孩還是女孩?
Male or female?

281
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:26,433
-那個學生是 凱利·范·賴安 -桑德拉·范·賴安家的?
-The student is Kelly Van Ryan. -As in Sandra Van Ryan?

282
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:29,074
他媽的.我真夠運氣
As in, l'm fucked.

283
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,269
說說看?
Why don't you tell me about it?

284
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,508
-從哪兒開始呢? -就從…
-Shit, where do l begin? -Start with...

285
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:41,681
…你和這個女孩兒的關係說起吧，叫凱利的
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.

286
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:47,158
她是我的一個學生.我是她的法律輔導員.除了這個，沒有其他關係
She's a student. l was her counselor. Beyond that, there's no relationship.

287
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,785
那就別擔心
You got nothing to worry about.

288
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,101
-你把你脖子怎麼了? -這個?
-What did you do to your neck? -This?

289
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,897
我不用整天帶著這個的
l don't have to wear it all the time.

290
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,606
先前有個保險公司的小子在那兒
There was an insurance guy around here earlier.

291
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,783
好吧，讓我先說說費用
All right, let me tell you how l charge.

292
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,926
喬治，你好.跟我說說有啥新聞？
Georgie, hey. We gonna catch some wind?

293
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,755
恐怕今天我不能為你停車了
Mr. Lombardo, l'm afraid l can't park your car today.

294
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,491
你不能為我停車? 我要和芭芭拉一起午餐
You can't park me? l'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

295
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:35,965
幫我停下車，喬治.我有點兒晚啦
Can you get this parked, Georgie? We're running late.

296
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,133
馬上，巴克斯特先生
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

297
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:43,078
你別上這兒來啦，倫巴多先生. 離這兒遠點兒
You're finished here, Lombardo. Take a hike.

298
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:51,119
芭芭拉，我們走
Barbara, let's go.

299
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,822
也許你沒聽清我說什麼，倫巴多
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.

300
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,522
你在藍灣完蛋啦
You're finished in Blue Bay.

301
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:06,330
如果我再發現你纏著我女兒， 你就徹底完蛋了
l find you around my daughter again, you'll be finished, period.

302
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,905
-滾開吧. - 倫巴多先生，請吧
-Get the fuck out of here. -Mr. Lombardo, please.

303
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,979
那好吧，喬治
That's all right, George.

304
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,934
薩姆，親愛的. 有一陣子沒見你了
Sam, honey. Haven't seen you in a while.

305
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:48,342
-歡迎回來 -朗姆酒加可樂
-Welcome back. -Rum and Coke.

306
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,865
你還好嗎?
Hey! Are you all right?

307
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,433
-我沒事. -酷?
-l'm fine. -Cool?

308
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,770
你這個混蛋，他媽的
That's too bad, motherfucker.

309
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,989
薩姆?
Sam?

310
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,030
倫巴多?
Lombardo?

311
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,956
站住，別動!是我啊
Whoa, man! lt's me.

312
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,658
對不起.這事兒越來越古怪了
Sorry, man. Things have been getting a little weird around here.

313
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,729
我明白
l can see that.

314
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,166
進來吧
Come on in.

315
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,369
你確定是 弗蘭克·亢多幹的?
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy is the guy that did this to you?

316
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,641
就是他，沒錯
lt was him, all right.

317
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:34,371
他開著桑德拉的車子
He was driving Sandra's Range Rover.

318
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:38,005
你把這些告訴員警，我們現在就能逮捕 桑德拉·范·賴安
You tell that to the cops, we can go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

319
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:41,415
-這事兒算啦. -這女人很有辦法
-Forget it. -The lady has deep pockets.

320
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:44,317
我知道她多有辦法
Believe me, l know how deep her pockets are.

321
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,927
我想過或者我還能保住房子 有些房屋抵押貸款--
l thought l might be able to save my house. Some sort of equity loan.

322
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:52,822
猜猜誰是銀行的部門主管?
Guess who's on the board of directors at the bank?

323
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,167
這個女人夠給我添亂的啦
l don't need any more trouble from this woman.

324
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,463
你覺得是不是應該弄個訴訟來讓她住手?
You think making some sort of statement's gonna stop her?

325
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,774
你說凱利跟我那件鳥事? 怎麼樣
With the shit l got on Kelly? Yeah.

326
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,399
一年前…
A year ago...

327
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:08,240
她父親把自己腦袋打開花
...when her old man blew his brains out...

328
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,644
…凱利 失魂落魄，離家出走
...Kelly lost it, ran away.

329
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,014
他們在一家破汽車旅館裏找到她時，可卡因正搞得她魂飛天外
They found her in a fleabag motel some place, coked out of her gourd.

330
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,751
這當中--
Meanwhile...

331
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,324
…你，薩姆，在那一年當了輔導員…
...you, Sam, are voted Educator of the Year...

332
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:22,756
…也許這都是廢話
...or some crap.

333
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,597
他們把你們兩個推到陪審員前面…
They put the two of you in front of a jury...

334
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:28,934
…看上去很蠢. 他們知道的
...they're gonna look stupid. They know it.

335
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,865
為什麼他們到現在還沒來要你的呈述?
Why do you think they haven't taken your statement yet?

336
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:34,663
因為他們忙於尋找證據…
Because they're busy looking for dirt.

337
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,603
但他們什麼也不會發現
And they're not gonna find it.

338
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:41,877
對不對?
Right?

339
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:46,345
肯，我沒有操我的學生
Ken, l don't fuck my students.

340
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:24,679
他只是在給你表演一下
He's just showing off for you now.

341
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,986
嘿，那兒，魯比
Hey there, Ruby.

342
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:31,458
看來你還是跟沃爾特將就著
l see you still got Walter.

343
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:34,397
我是希望有什麼東西把他吃掉
l was hoping something had eaten him by now.

344
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:39,729
-有什麼事嗎? -蘇西給我們電話了
-Can l help you with something? -Suzie called us.

345
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,964
她在哪兒?
Where would we find her?

346
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,109
你認得路的
You know the way.

347
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,247
你不會開槍打她吧，啊?
You won't shoot her, will you?

348
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,251
我不相信她會有武裝
l don't believe she's armed.

349
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,726
誰呀?
Yeah?

350
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,196
你們路上走這麼久
Jesus, it took you guys long enough.

351
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:48,170
有人來掐死我的話時間剛好夠… 或者操我的屁股
What if someone was trying to strangle me or fuck me in the ass?

352
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,400
你們負責性犯罪?
l mean, you guys do sex crimes, right?

353
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:55,545
我的搭檔，皮裏警探
My partner, Detective Perez.

354
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:05,853
這是西林. 他很棒…他對賤人很有研究
lt's C?line. He's okay. He had a good line on what cheap fucks people are.

355
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:08,789
蘇西，你打電話叫我們來.記得嗎?
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us. Remember?

356
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,326
他們把倫巴多先生關起來啦?
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

357
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,601
沒有
No.

358
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,601
- 會關他? - 我不知道
-Will they? -l don't know.

359
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,645
你操心這個?
That bothers you?

360
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,018
我想出去走走
l wanna go outside.

361
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:44,154
薩姆 倫巴多讓你搭他的便車是什麼時候?
When was this that Sam Lombardo gave you the ride?

362
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,321
大概一年前
About a year ago.

363
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,661
你是什麼時候到達的，那兒有其他人嗎?
And when you arrived at your trailer, was anyone there?

364
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:52,429
-沒有. -這麼說只有你一個人
-Nope. -So you were alone.

365
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,265
是
Yeah.

366
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,271
他和你一起進屋了嗎?
Did he come in with you?

367
00:37:56,442 --> 00:38:01,038
-我想是. -你想是的.好吧，進還是沒有?
-l guess. -You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?

368
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:04,148
好吧.是，他進屋了
Okay. Yeah, he did.

369
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:05,908
然後呢?他摸你了嗎?
And then what? Did he touch you?

370
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:09,020
你，也許，有沒有跟他調情?
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?

371
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:12,589
蘇西，我知道你很難受
Suzie, look, l know you feel bad.

372
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:17,186
-但你必須告訴我們實情. -我什麼也沒跟他說
-Just tell us the truth. -l didn't say a thing to him.

373
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:22,031
他抱住我說我很好看
He just put his arm around me and told me l was pretty.

374
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,326
他說他想知道我是否真的好看
l could be really pretty, he said.

375
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,733
你有沒有要他停下來?
Did you ask him to stop?

376
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,431
見鬼
Shit.

377
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,674
這有什麼差別?不管怎樣都沒人會相信我的
What difference does it make? No one believes me anyway.

378
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:37,077
-薩姆 倫巴多強姦你了? - 是的. 好不好?他做了
-Did Sam Lombardo rape you? -Yeah. Okay? He did.

379
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,547
他把我推倒在地板上，然後他幹了
He pushed me to the floor and he did it to me.

380
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,584
- 那我們算是結束啦？ - 差不多是蘇西
-Now are we done? -Almost, Suzie.

381
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,520
差不多
Almost.

382
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,221
這麼說吧，你有沒有反抗過?
At some point, were you able to fight him off?

383
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:54,755
沒有.他自己停下來了
No. He stopped by himself.

384
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,427
好了吧?就是這些了?讓我一個人呆會兒
Okay? ls that it? Leave me alone.

385
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:02,407
- 別碰我! - 放鬆點…放鬆點…
-Don't touch me! -All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

386
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,371
他停下來了
He stopped.

387
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:07,774
就這些?他就這麼離開了?
And that was it? He just left?

388
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,145
是的
Yeah.

389
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,981
他先說過一句話
He did say one thing first.

390
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:15,720
說什麼?
What was that?

391
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:20,482
他說:「沒有小婊子能給我高潮的.」
He said, ''No little bitch can ever make me come.''

392
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,326
打開門
Open the gate.

393
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:34,136
- 嘿，輔導員，給支煙怎麼樣? - 你好，倒楣蛋
-Hey, counselor, how about a smoke? -Hello, Jinxy.

394
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:40,674
現在的消息是好壞各半
You know, it's really a bad news, good news situation.

395
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:45,549
你不准保釋，但你有個真正的律師…
You were denied bail, but you got a real attorney...

396
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,742
而不是由法庭隨便指派個辯護人
...instead of a public defender.

397
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,154
我告訴你，肯，我是清白的
l'm telling you, Ken, l'm innocent.

398
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:55,824
你還是對法庭的人說吧.你不是孤立無援的
You are preaching to the choir. You're not alone.

399
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:05,335
你就是那個小色鬼
So you're the new chicken licker.

400
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:16,208
桑德拉，說說你的想法?
Sandra, can we get your comment?

401
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,508
能談談你此時的心情嗎?
Can l just have your feelings at this time?

402
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:21,152
倫巴多 先生會得到應有的懲罰的
Mr. Lombardo will get what he deserves.

403
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:23,446
能說幾句話嗎?
Can you tell us anything?

404
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,954
- 您有信心打贏這場官司嗎? - 很有信心
-Are you confident about the case? -Very. Yes.

405
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,992
倫巴多強姦案在藍灣高級住宅區引起轟動…
The Lombardo rape case has galvanized the upscale town...

406
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:31,152
在那些小報的煽動下
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.

407
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,230
剛剛到達的是，桑德拉·范·賴安…
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...

大宗地產的女繼承人 藍灣上流社會的精英
...jet-set real estate heiress and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

409
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:41,099
從相反方向過來的是那女孩
And the girl from the wrong side of the tracks. ln the end, the jury...

410
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:44,140
到最後，陪審團要在這個18歲的女孩…
...must choose between the words of these 1 8-year-old girls...

411
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,901
和薩姆 倫巴多的呈詞之間作出裁決
...and that of Sam Lombardo.

412
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,740
這是在法院門前的現場報導… 我是新聞目擊欄目的南西·多爾
Reporting from the courthouse steps, l'm Nancy Duerr.

413
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,575
我是新聞目擊欄目的南西·多爾

00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,789
佛羅里達州州對薩姆 倫巴多的起訴.
The State of Florida v. Sam Lombardo.

415
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,860

The Honorable Sylvia B. Waxman presiding. All rise.

416
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,062
我們要站起來
We gotta stand up.

417
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,224
請坐下
Please be seated.

418
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:46,064
現在坐下
Now sit down.

419
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:01,883
還要等等，凱利?
Would you like more time, Kelly?

420
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:10,587
我知道這很難，凱利…
l know that this is hard, Kelly...

421
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,765
但我還要多問一個問題
...but l have one more question.

422
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,799
雖然大部分事實已經陳述過
And even though it's something we've been over...

423
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:20,200
但我希望我們大家完全弄清楚這件事
...l want us all to be very clear about it.

424
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,142
凱利，當你看到倫巴多先生…
Kelly , when you saw that Mr. Lombardo...

425
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:28,508
試圖和你發生性行為時
...intended to have sex with you...

426
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,807
準確地說 你如何說的?
...what were your exact words?

427
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,283
他說了什麼?
What did you say?

428
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,920
我對他說「不要.」
l told him ''No.''

429
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,752
我說，停下來，倫巴多先生.求你了…
l said, ''Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please.''

430
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:46,354
我尖叫著要他停下來
l screamed for him to stop.

431
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48,797
你尖叫著要他…
You screamed for him...

432
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,365
…停下來
...to stop.

433
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,301
那他呢?
And did he?

434
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,469
不
No.

435
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:01,471
他在那髒屋子的地板上強姦了我
He raped me on the floor of his shitty house.

436
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,620
謝謝你
Thank you.

437
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:17,796
這是倫巴多強姦案的第二天…
lt's day two of the Lombardo rape case and the second alleged young victim...

438
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:21,562
又有第二個前法律輔導員的年輕受害者…
lt's day two of the Lombardo rape case and the second alleged young victim...

439
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,531
站出來聲稱
...of the former guidance counselor has taken the stand.

440
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:28,503
昨天，凱利 范·賴安對事件做了激動的陳述
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan delivered an emotional account of events...

441
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:32,110
…在辯護律師的交叉質詢下毫不動搖.
...and was not swayed by defense counsel's cross-examination.

442
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,474
早間晚些時候我們將回到有新的進展的事件現場
We'll come back live later with an update of these proceedings.

443
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:38,445
法庭門前的現場報導… 我是新聞目擊欄目的…
Reporting from the courthouse steps, I'm Nancy Duerr...

444
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:40,517
南西·多爾
...Eyewitness News.

445
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,865
各位早上好
Good morning, everybody.

446
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:04,541
托樂小姐
Ms. Toller.

447
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,002
當你…
When you were...

448
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,809
還是藍灣的新生，因在商店行竊被抓時
...picked up for shoplifting your freshman year at Blue Bay...

449
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,043
你被允許打一個電話…
...and you were allowed to make one call...

450
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,383
你打給倫巴多先生. 是不是這樣?
...you called Mr. Lombardo. lsn't that correct?

451
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,453
托樂小姐?
Ms. Toller?

452
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:24,357
-是. -當你被開除…
-Yes. -And when you were expelled...

453
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:26,895
…因為毀壞藍灣高中的財產
...for destruction of school property--

454
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:30,296
我只是搞壞一個破窗戶.那甚至不是我的錯
l broke a fucking window. And it wasn't even my fault.

455
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:35,062
托樂小姐，你要等要求你回答時才能講話…
Ms. Toller, you will wait until you are asked before responding...

456
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,539
否則你會因為褻瀆法庭而受到拘訓
...and you will refrain from using profanity in this court.

457
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:46,344
倫巴多先生出席你的家長會
lt was Mr. Lombardo who appeared with you in lieu of a parent conference.

458
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,008
對嗎?
ls that right?

459
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,551
是
Yes.

460
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,956
在我看來…
lt seems to me...

461
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:56,458
…倫巴多先生是你的朋友
...that Mr. Lombardo was your friend.

462
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:58,323
他過去是的
He was.

463
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:02,467
但這一切都改變了，當…
But all that changed when...

464
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:06,100
…根據你的陳述
...according to your testimony...

465
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,099
倫巴多先生…
...Mr. Lombardo...

466
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:11,003
…強姦你…
...raped you...

467
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,343
…時間是去年的4月23日，對嗎?
...on April 23 of last year, is that right?

468
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:19,277
- 是. - 但是接著在5月…
-Yes. -But then in May...

469
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:23,445
…當你因為非法持有毒品被逮捕時…
...when you were arrested for possession of narcotics...

470
00:45:23,622 --> 00:45:26,113
…而再次被允許打一個電話時…
...and again allowed a phone call...

471
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,250
…你又是打給倫巴多先生
...you called Mr. Lombardo.

472
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:37,665
-那又怎樣? -那又怎樣?
-So what? -So what?

473
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,267
怎樣?
So what?

474
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:46,806
你看，蘇西
Oops, Suzie.

475
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:52,713
那就是說 在你說的那個男人強姦你的僅僅一個月後，你去向他求助?
So one month after you say this man raped you, you go to him for help?

476
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,483
聽起來你仍然覺得倫巴多先生是一個很好的朋友
Sounds as if you still considered Mr. Lombardo a good friend.

477
00:45:58,657 --> 00:46:01,217
- 我需要幫助. - 我知道你需要
-l needed help. -l'm sure you did.

478
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,551
但是倫巴多先生這次不在那裏
But Mr. Lombardo wasn't there this time.

479
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:05,457
那是夏天，他外出了…
lt was summer, he was gone...

480
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:10,228
你在州立管教所裏度過6個月
...and you spent six months in a state correctional facility.

481
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,795
那是不是讓你生氣啦蘇西，蘇西…
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

482
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:16,668
…因為薩姆外出?? 他沒在那兒?
...that Sam was gone? That he wasn't there?

483
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,577
就是因為這原因你才這麼說 倫巴多先生的?
ls that why you're saying these things about Mr. Lombardo...

484
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:24,340
-…說你的朋友? -我這麼說是因為它發生過
-...your friend? -l said them because they happened.

485
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:27,314
你能坐在這裏，宣誓
Ms. Toller, are you gonna sit there today, under oath...

486
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:29,852
說撒母耳·倫巴多強姦你?
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo raped you?

487
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,046
我說過他做了
l said he did.

488
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,881
我來問你一個問題.托樂小姐
Let me ask you a question, Ms. Toller.

489
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,689
你很喜歡做政府的客人對不對?
Did you enjoy being a guest of the state?

490
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:41,859
因為我敢肯定如果你對山姆倫巴多這事說謊的話…
Because l promise you, if you are lying about this...

491
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:43,660
而且我相信你說了謊…
...and l believe you are...

492
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:47,293
你會很快再次光臨管教所
...that you will be visiting that facility again quite soon.

493
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:51,633
那就是為什麼我要再次問你…你發誓…
Which is why l'm gonna ask you again now, under oath.

494
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,471
蘇西…
Suzie...

495
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,908
…撒母耳·倫巴多有沒有強姦你?
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

496
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:04,987
托樂小姐，你必須回答這個問題
Ms. Toller, you will have to answer the question.

497
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,187
托樂小姐. -去死吧!
-Ms. Toller. -Goddamn it!

498
00:47:13,732 --> 00:47:16,030
- 這不是我的主意. - 反對，法官大人
-This was not my idea. -Objection, Your Honor.

499
00:47:16,368 --> 00:47:19,860
很明顯托樂小姐正被律師誘導
Ms. Toller is clearly responding to defense counsel's badgering.

500
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:23,235
法庭很想聽聽托勒小姐說的話
Court would like to hear what Ms. Toller has to say.

501
00:47:23,475 --> 00:47:25,500
托樂小姐?
Ms. Toller?

502
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,880
薩姆 倫巴多沒有強姦我
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

503
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,645
他也沒有強姦凱利. 他什麼也沒做
He didn't rape Kelly either. He didn't do anything.

504
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:39,256
這真荒謬，證人受到辯護律師的直接恐嚇
This is ridiculous. The witness has been threatened by defense counsel!

505
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:42,951
我已經說明了法庭將要聽取托樂小姐的陳訴
l think l made it plain this court intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.

506
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,626
托樂小姐
Ms. Toller.

507
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:50,597
我想傷害 倫巴多先生
l just wanted to hurt Mr. Lombardo.

508
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:54,329
他開頭是我的朋友
He was my friend at first.

509
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:57,566
後來我被抓了… 他卻不再保護我…
And then l got busted, and he didn't stick up for me...

510
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:00,142
而我不得不滾到那個鬼地方去
...and l had to go away to that hell hole.

511
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:02,906
一開始你是他的最愛，然後卻「誰管你?」
lt's like you're his favorite, and then ''Who cares?''

512
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:04,514
讓她停下來
Make her stop.

513
00:48:04,683 --> 00:48:07,117
凱利 說要這麼做…
When Kelly said that we should do this...

514
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,150
-…我在想，「真酷.」 -凱利!
-...l thought, ''Cool.'' -Kelly!

515
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:12,620
那些大人物給找我的麻煩，像 杜奎特警官
All these big shots screwing me over, like that cop, Duquette.

516
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:15,988
-現在他們自己有麻煩了. -對不起，法官大人
-Now they're gonna get screwed. -l'm sorry, Your Honor.

517
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:17,458
我反對
l have to object.

518
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,393
法官大人，我能講幾句嗎?
Your Honor, please, may l be heard?

519
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,433
巴克斯特先生，你不負責這件案子
Mr. Baxter, you are not trying this case.

520
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:25,865
坐下
Go sit down.

521
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:33,608
凱利對 倫巴多先生也很惱火
Kelly's pissed at Mr. Lombardo too.

522
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,642
她愛上了他
She's in love with him.

523
00:48:36,815 --> 00:48:39,079
自從她老頭死後，他是她的幻想
He's been her fantasy since her old man died.

524
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,117
後來她卻發現 倫巴多先生在和她媽幹，就這樣
Then she found out he was doing her mom, and that was it.

525
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:44,187
什麼? 凱利!
What? Kelly!

526
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,517
你這個臭婊子!
You skanky bitch!

527
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,619
你他媽的把手拿開!你不知道我是誰嗎?
Get your fucking hands off of me! Don't you know who l am?

528
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:53,923
-我準備週一開除你! -就這樣
-l'm gonna have you fired on Monday! -Right this way.

529
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,300
拿開這個破東西
Just get the hell away from me.

530
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,542
上帝呀，夥計! 該放鬆一下啦!
Jesus, man! Let loose!

531
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,837
我在想我住在哪兒
l'm just thinking about where l'm gonna stay.

532
00:49:10,015 --> 00:49:12,279
我的房子沒了
l lost my house.

533
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,509
從這該死的惡夢中清醒過來吧
Waking up from a goddamn nightmare.

534
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:16,176
你就要熬過來了
You'll get over it.

535
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:19,482
我們給她很重的一記，案子辦得無懈可擊…
We have got a knockdown, airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

536
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:21,990
…給桑德拉·范·賴安
...against Sandra Van Ryan.

537
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,991
也就是這樣
Just like that?

538
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:25,424
也就是這樣
Just like that?

539
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:28,223
這些人毀掉你的生活，兄弟
These people ruined your life, bro.

540
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:33,003
我跟你說他們太過分.會走過頭的!就是沒錯!
l told you they were gonna go too far. They went overboard! They did!

541
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:37,631
他們會善後的，相信我. 他們會懇求著安排善後
They'll settle. Believe me. They'll be begging to settle.

542
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:41,510
哦好啦! 上吧! 等著吧!快點兒，寶貝
Oh, yeah! Here we go! Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.

543
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,945
事情驚人地變化， 薩姆 倫巴多案被駁回…
In a startling turn of events, Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...

544
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:48,677
他的一個聲稱的受害者推翻先前的證詞
...following a reversal of testimony by one of his alleged victims.

545
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,887
嘿，看這兒
Excuse me. Over here.

546
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:52,751
嘿.有人看報了嗎?
Excuse me. Can anybody read?

547
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:56,718
嘿! 桑德拉!
Hey! Sandra!

548
00:49:56,928 --> 00:50:00,864
我真想你馬上把那訟棍的蛋釘到牆上
l want you to nail that shyster's balls to the nearest wall.

549
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:04,001
本來是可能的…
We could have, if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...

550
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:06,228
-…要是那個笨小姐不澤出這些鬼話… -我操
-...hadn't thrown things. -Fuck off.

551
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:11,398
我都不敢相信你會讓他從這個垃圾堆逃出來
l cannot believe you're just gonna let them get away with this shit!

552
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:14,204
這個最爛的雜種
All on the word of one little white-trash bitch.

553
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:17,348
我想你還沒搞明白，桑迪
l don't think you get it, Sandy.

554
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,506
你的寶貝女兒做了偽證
Your princess here committed perjury.

555
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:23,450
我所能做的只是讓她逃脫他媽的牢獄之災
lt'll be all l can do to keep her fucking little ass out of jail.

556
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:26,681
那我們要做什麼?
Well, what are we going to do?

557
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:37,166
- 給你咖啡. - 謝謝你
-You're gonna love this place, Tom. -Thank you.

558
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,764
傑珀·波克·樸萊特會殺了你
That jalape?o pork platter will kill you.

559
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,367
我的意思是:你不能這個星期每天都吃壽司
l mean, you can't eat sushi every day of the week.

560
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,944
寶登，為什麼不停下
Bowden, why don't you cut the crap...

561
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:52,083
…告訴我你的客戶究竟需要什麼
...and tell me what your client really wants.

562
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:56,954
好的，巴克斯特
Okay, Baxter.

563
00:50:57,122 --> 00:51:01,024
我的客戶希望你的客戶戴上馬鞍…
My client wants your client to saddle up...

564
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:03,752
…然後我們騎在他的屁股上面直奔銀行
...so we can ride her ass straight to the bank.

565
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:10,000
你知道的，肯
You know, Ken.

566
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:11,530
我可以叫你 肯麼?
May l call you Ken?

567
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:16,301
另外的案件，另外的時間
There will be other cases, other days.

568
00:51:18,877 --> 00:51:21,243
我明白…
The way l see it...

569
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,709
湯米
...Tommy...

570
00:51:23,882 --> 00:51:27,215
…今天所有人都吃屎了嗎?
...is that everybody's gotta eat some shit sometime.

571
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:30,917
你要熱的麼?
You like yours hot?

572
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,886
是的
Yeah.

573
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:43,800
- 給你咖啡，薩姆. - 謝謝你
-Here's your coffee, Sam. -Thank you.

574
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:59,077
肯
Ken.

575
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:13,460
對不起我晚了
Sorry l'm late.

576
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,064
替我接一下電話，勒諾
Hold my calls, Lenore.

577
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,261
好的，寶登先生
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

578
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:41,949
謝謝你，桑德拉
Thank you, Sandra.

579
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,298
我會找你的
l'll be seeing you.

580
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,731
- 怎麼樣? - 好啊. 來吧
-Okay? -Okay. Yeah.

581
00:52:57,909 --> 00:53:00,139
很高興見到你，湯姆
Nice to see you, Tom.

582
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,070
一起來吧 午餐
Come by. We'll have lunch.

583
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:07,778
俱樂部見
See you at the club.

584
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:12,046
俱樂部見
See you at the club.

585
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:14,918
俱樂部見
See you at the club.

586
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:17,117
俱樂部見
See you at the club.

587
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:19,423
俱樂部見，湯米!
See you at the club, Tommy!

588
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:22,623
嘿，湯米，今天戰績如何，朋友?
Hey, Tom. What did you shoot today, pal?

589
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,859
嘿，我說夥計!
Hey, my man!

590
00:53:26,905 --> 00:53:28,998
這是給你的
This is for you.

591
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,770
-你做的很棒，肯. -是的
-You did good, Ken. -Yeah.

592
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:33,638
謝謝
Thanks.

593
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:38,839
我知道你寧願什麼事都沒發生…但它發生了…
l know there's a part of you that wishes none of this had happened, but it did.

594
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:41,815
那就拿著這錢好好享受一下
So take the money and enjoy yourself.

595
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:45,012
怎麼樣?找個好地方
All right? Find a happy place.

596
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,919
勒諾，送倫巴多先生出去好嗎?
Lenore, would you see Mr. Lombardo out, please?

597
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:51,323
-再見，薩姆. -再見，勒諾
-Goodbye, Sam. -Bye, Lenore.

598
00:54:08,853 --> 00:54:11,287
照看好我的蜥蜴，好嗎?
Take care of my lizards?

599
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,893
你好，凱利
Hello, Kelly.

600
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,058
去死吧
Drop dead.

601
00:54:23,234 --> 00:54:27,466
你知道我媽媽付給你什麼了?我的信託基金
You know how my mom's paying you off? She's breaking my trust.

602
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:32,071
她死前我動不到這些錢，但現在她賠給你
l can't touch it until she's dead, and now she's breaking it to pay you.

603
00:54:32,243 --> 00:54:33,505
對不起，凱利
l'm sorry, Kelly.

604
00:54:33,678 --> 00:54:36,670
為什麼你不再去幹她啊 !你們可以一起花這錢
Why don't you start fucking her again! You can spend it together!

605
00:54:36,848 --> 00:54:39,510
我他媽的恨死你了，你這個雜種!
l hate you! l fucking hate you, you son of a bitch!

606
00:54:40,051 --> 00:54:41,985
我恨死你了!
l fucking hate you!

607
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:58,226
你看，阿蒂?我不能再回來了，即使我想回來
You see, Art? l couldn't come back even if l wanted to.

608
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:37,933
可惡的女傭
Goddamn maid.

609
00:56:13,545 --> 00:56:15,479
那麼你拿到了我媽媽的錢
So you got my mom's money.

610
00:56:17,182 --> 00:56:18,774
多少?
How much?

611
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:21,174
多少?
How much?

612
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,184
你知道有多少
You know how much.

613
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,253
那該你付帳了
Your turn to pay.

614
00:56:29,461 --> 00:56:32,794
成功了! 我們幹掉這個婊子啦!
lt worked! We screwed the bitch!

615
00:56:33,631 --> 00:56:36,327
說的對
lt worked just like you said.

616
00:56:37,569 --> 00:56:39,127
怎麼了?
What's wrong?

617
00:56:39,304 --> 00:56:42,569
你他媽的把我嚇壞啦.你不該來這兒.就這個
You scared the shit out of me. What's wrong is your coming here.

618
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:46,369
你他媽的瘋了嗎?
That's what's wrong. Are you fucking crazy?

619
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:50,846
是的，我是瘋了… 去問問我媽媽
Yeah, l'm crazy. Ask my mom.

620
00:56:54,185 --> 00:56:57,518
那麼，8百50萬元分成三份是多少呢?
So how much is 8.5 million divided by three?

621
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,786
哦，很好
Oh, great. Yeah, this is a big joke. Big joke.

622
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,896
都覺得很好笑嗎.你們真他媽的認為這事完了嗎?
Everyone thinks this is really funny. Do you think this is fucking over?

623
00:57:06,064 --> 00:57:09,591
我告訴你們.還早著呢
Let me tell you something. lt's a long fucking way from over.

624
00:57:11,002 --> 00:57:13,163
我是認真的
l'm serious.

625
00:57:15,607 --> 00:57:19,566
今晚以後，我們三個不能再被人看到在一起
After tonight the three of us are not to be seen together again.

626
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,904
今晚以後?
After tonight?

627
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:26,612
是的，好了
Yeah, well...

628
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,177
…我們都在這兒了，不是嗎?
...we're here, aren't we?

629
00:57:32,056 --> 00:57:34,684
也許慶祝一下也不錯…
So maybe one celebration is okay...

630
00:57:35,426 --> 00:57:37,587
如果我們達成一致的話…
...if we're in agreement...

631
00:57:38,530 --> 00:57:40,361
那麼從現在…
...that from here on out...

632
00:57:42,367 --> 00:57:45,131
你們就要完全照我說的做
...you do exactly as l say.

633
00:58:27,645 --> 00:58:31,137
法律輔導員總是很會找樂子
Guidance counselors get to find out all sorts of interesting things.

634
00:58:43,861 --> 00:58:46,329
現在我要你們兩個接吻
Now l want you two to kiss.

635
00:58:47,966 --> 00:58:49,934
來吧
Come on, now.

636
00:58:50,101 --> 00:58:53,195
別為這事吵一天
Never let the sun go down on an argument.

637
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:13,948
我告訴過你，他們把我們當傻瓜玩
l told you they were gonna make us look stupid.

638
01:00:14,552 --> 01:00:18,352
你說的沒錯.他們的確把我們當傻瓜
Hey, you're right. They did make us look stupid.

639
01:00:18,923 --> 01:00:20,914
你錯在不知為什麼
What you're wrong about is why.

640
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,058
聽聽我的看法
All right, hear me out.

641
01:00:23,528 --> 01:00:26,463
倫巴多跟桑德拉·范·賴安之間有一腿，是嗎?
Lombardo was having an affair with Sandra Van Ryan, right?

642
01:00:26,631 --> 01:00:27,928
為什麼他不告訴我們?
Why not tell us about it?

643
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:31,432
要是 凱利編造的這故事這正好是個動機
That's a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate this story.

644
01:00:31,602 --> 01:00:34,696
也許倫巴多的律師在法庭上留這一手
Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.

645
01:00:34,872 --> 01:00:38,205
我想過這些事，然後說:你是倫巴多.你已完蛋了
l thought about it and said: ''You're Lombardo. Your life is trashed.

646
01:00:38,376 --> 01:00:41,277
你又不想在監獄裏熬三個月，除非--
You don't wanna sit in jail for three months unless--''

647
01:00:41,446 --> 01:00:43,175
除非什麼?
Unless what?

648
01:00:45,116 --> 01:00:48,483
除非你設計要桑德拉·范·賴安跟你在哪天結一個大帳
Unless you're setting Sandra Van Ryan up for the big payday.

649
01:00:48,653 --> 01:00:52,089
在整個這事發生前，倫巴多已經債務纏身
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt before this whole thing started...

650
01:00:52,256 --> 01:00:56,192
…要想繼續維持芭芭拉巴克斯特那樣昂貴的講究的生活
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.

651
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,795
倫巴多 可能會破產，但為什麼 凱利要偷這個錢?
Lombardo may be broke, but why would Kelly steal?

652
01:00:58,963 --> 01:01:02,865
這小子拿到的這筆錢是她祖父留下的，而她在她母親去世前是不能碰它們的
Kid's got money from her grandfather she can't touch until her mother dies.

653
01:01:03,134 --> 01:01:07,434
我來告訴你，這個小子本想跟有錢人結婚
l'm telling you, this guy wanted to marry money.

654
01:01:08,172 --> 01:01:11,699
當這些不能實現… 他就去在這兩個女孩身上下工夫…
When that didn't happen, he went to work on these two girls...

655
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,867
…利用她們去算計桑德拉·范·賴安
...using them to set up Sandra Van Ryan.

656
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,275
我告訴你， 他當我們是白癡搭檔.
I'm telling you, they chumped us, partner.

657
01:01:16,447 --> 01:01:19,416
他們從一開始就把我們當木頭.
They chumped us right from the start.

658
01:02:13,905 --> 01:02:15,736
遊得不錯
Nice stroke.

659
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,433
你來這裏有什麼原因嗎?
ls there some reason why you're here?

660
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:21,874
-我想，是好奇. -好奇什麼?
-Curiosity, l guess. -About what?

661
01:02:22,046 --> 01:02:24,742
怎麼提高你的蛙泳水準?
How to improve your breast stroke?

662
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:30,380
我好奇的是在你看來你和薩姆，蘇西三個人以後會怎樣?
No. l want to know how you see things working out for you, Sam and Suzie.

663
01:02:32,156 --> 01:02:33,418
什麼意思?
Excuse me?

664
01:02:33,591 --> 01:02:35,923
你們三人是想要一起到加勒比海…
You three gonna go to the Caribbean together?

665
01:02:36,093 --> 01:02:37,526
從此以後過快樂生活?
Live happily ever after?

666
01:02:37,929 --> 01:02:41,092
問題是三人組合很少能一直合作下去
You see, the thing about it is that threesomes rarely work out.

667
01:02:41,265 --> 01:02:42,527
你丫神經病吧
You're out of your mind.

668
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:46,033
要一個人保守秘密已經很難 別提三個啦
lt's hard enough for one person to keep a secret, let alone three.

669
01:02:46,204 --> 01:02:49,071
特別是當其中兩人相愛時
Especially when two of them are in love.

670
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:53,872
既然得到那些錢，你和薩姆可不想邊上有個吸毒的
You and Sam don't want that pill-head around now that you have the money.

671
01:02:54,846 --> 01:02:56,313
…我說的沒錯吧?
Am l right?

672
01:02:56,481 --> 01:02:59,814
薩姆幹掉蘇西前會不會跟你說一下?
Sam sell you on the idea right up front of whacking Suzie? Hey!

673
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:03,317
那會是謀殺，孩子
That's murder, kid.

674
01:03:03,488 --> 01:03:06,651
上帝啊，警官，省省吧
Police. God, get a life.

675
01:03:08,359 --> 01:03:10,327
你覺得很好?
You're good, you know that?

676
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:16,291
但你是不是不曾想過那個怪誕的蘇西家會成為一個阻礙?
But you don't think that little freak Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?

677
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:39,616
你好.，蘇西
Hello, Suzie.

678
01:03:40,491 --> 01:03:42,220
你最好別再碰那該死的東西
You better watch it with that shit.

679
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:45,089
你又出事啦，這是第二次
You get busted again, you go back in a two-time loser.

680
01:03:45,263 --> 01:03:47,424
沒錯，大不了去死
Yeah, or wind up dead.

681
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,332
你知道…
You know...

682
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:01,672
我想我從未告訴過你，我對你朋友的事感到有多抱歉
...l don't think l ever told you how sorry l was about your friend.

683
01:04:01,979 --> 01:04:03,879
他叫什麼?
What was his name?

684
01:04:07,118 --> 01:04:10,645
蘇西.你記得他名字的.告訴我
Come on, help me out here, Suzie. You know his name.

685
01:04:13,257 --> 01:04:17,557
-大衛. -是的.沒錯. 大衛
-Davy. -Yeah. That's right. Davy.

686
01:04:17,828 --> 01:04:19,955
我真的對那事情感到抱歉
l was sorry about the way that worked out.

687
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:22,929
- 那都是你們員警的廢話. - 你說什麼?
-That is cop bullshit. -What was that? What was that?

688
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,069
我再也不用聽這些 你再也別想壓著我
l don't have to listen to this. You can't shove me around.

689
01:04:26,237 --> 01:04:28,432
-我現在有朋友了. -嘿!
-l have friends now. -Hey!

690
01:04:28,606 --> 01:04:31,370
這是雷，蘇西. 你別想糊弄過去!
This is Ray, Suzie. You don't have shit!

691
01:04:31,542 --> 01:04:35,069
你從來就混不過去， 你以後也混不掉
You never had shit and you never will have shit.

692
01:04:39,483 --> 01:04:41,451
看看這個
Take a look at this.

693
01:04:42,186 --> 01:04:44,654
看看.它不會咬你的
Go ahead, take it. lt's not gonna bite you.

694
01:04:45,156 --> 01:04:46,418
拿著!
Take it!

695
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:53,257
你的朋友薩姆存的支票
Your friend Sam deposited the check.

696
01:04:54,565 --> 01:04:58,626
他把錢轉到一個離岸帳戶，一個數字帳號
He transferred the funds to a numbered offshore account.

697
01:04:58,803 --> 01:05:01,829
警局甚至不知道帳戶的名字是誰.想想其中有一個名字會是你嗎?
Cops don't know the names on it. Think one of them is yours?

698
01:05:02,807 --> 01:05:07,005
他為一個小島付下定金，而且分期付款買一艘遊艇
He also put a down payment on island property and a lease on a sailboat.

699
01:05:07,178 --> 01:05:08,805
你要去出海，是嗎?
You're into sailing, aren't you?

700
01:05:08,980 --> 01:05:12,143
我不知道你為什麼要告訴我這些，為什麼要來這兒?
l don't know why you're telling me this. Why are you here?

701
01:05:12,316 --> 01:05:15,376
我告訴你是因為我完全知道將要發生的事
l'm telling you this because l know exactly what's going on.

702
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:19,620
兩個人可以成為夥伴， 三個人就多餘了
Two's company. Three's a crowd.

703
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:21,724
現在相信我
Come on, now.

704
01:05:21,892 --> 01:05:25,487
你也不認為凱利和薩姆 會和你一起分這筆錢吧?
You don't think Kelly and Sam are gonna share that money with you.

705
01:05:27,732 --> 01:05:29,723
讓我單獨呆會兒
Leave me alone.

706
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:39,767
你要知道
You know...

707
01:05:39,944 --> 01:05:42,640
你要知道，如果我是你，我就希望我現在腦子清醒點兒…
...l'd want a clear head right now if l were you...

708
01:05:43,447 --> 01:05:47,543
這樣我就能看清楚我的新朋友
...so l could keep a real close eye on my new friends.

709
01:05:48,786 --> 01:05:51,755
我不願看到你的結局那麼慘…
l'd hate to see you come to a bad end...

710
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,953
…就像 大衛一樣
...like Davy.

711
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:07,732
真見鬼
Oh, shit.

712
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:18,170
我是薩姆 倫巴多. 請在嗶聲後留言.
You've reached Sam Lombardo. Wait for the beep, leave a message.

713
01:06:33,164 --> 01:06:36,497
我真不能相信你竟會給薩姆打電話.你到底怎麼了?
l can't believe you called Sam. What's the matter with you?

714
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:38,999
我很害怕，我不知道該相信誰
l'm scared there's no one to trust.

715
01:06:39,170 --> 01:06:41,502
你可以相信我
You can trust me.

716
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:49,712
喂?
Hello?

717
01:06:50,381 --> 01:06:52,941
-凱利，蘇西在你這兒? - 是的
-Kelly, is Suzie there? -Yeah.

718
01:06:53,117 --> 01:06:55,085
我正擔心這個.
Christ, l was afraid of that.

719
01:06:55,252 --> 01:06:57,220
她給我留下個蠢話
She left this insane message.

720
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,856
一邊抽著那些東西
Between whatever she's been smoking out there...

721
01:07:00,024 --> 01:07:02,322
…一邊是這他媽的員警.她真會搞砸掉.
...and this fucking cop, she's gonna blow it.

722
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:05,324
讓這婊子冷靜下來.
Calm the bitch down.

723
01:07:05,496 --> 01:07:08,465
為什麼你不能來，求你？
Why can't you come? Please?

724
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,761
薩姆，我真的好想你
Sam, l miss you so much.

725
01:07:15,272 --> 01:07:19,265
我也想你，凱利，但是現在不行.
l miss you too, Kelly, but l can't right now.

726
01:07:19,443 --> 01:07:21,434
我們要完成計畫，好嗎?
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?

727
01:07:22,513 --> 01:07:24,378
如果他媽的她不能挺住--….
If she can't get a fucking grip....

728
01:07:24,548 --> 01:07:27,608
- 那怎麼樣? - 你知道怎樣.
-Then what? -You know what.

729
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:29,981
我會親自處理的
I'll handle it.

730
01:07:30,154 --> 01:07:33,521
但我需要你，凱利.我要你今晚為我呆在那兒.
But l need you, Kelly. l need you to be there for me tonight.

731
01:07:34,759 --> 01:07:36,954
- 好吧. - 很好.
-Okay. -Good.

732
01:07:37,128 --> 01:07:39,995
這才是我的好姑娘.你很堅強，知道嗎?
That's my girl. You're the strong one, you know that?

733
01:07:41,232 --> 01:07:44,668
現在叫蘇西也來聽. 我想要你們兩個都聽著.
Now, put Suzie on the line. I want you both to hear this.

734
01:07:45,669 --> 01:07:47,364
蘇西.
Suzie.

735
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,933
薩姆?
Sam?

736
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:51,597
現在，聽著…
Now, look...

737
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:54,677
…我們要冷靜下來，我們每個人…
...we gotta stay calm, all of us.

738
01:07:54,845 --> 01:07:58,076
現在，這事以後，人們都認為我很有錢了…
Now, since the settlement, people think l'm rich...

739
01:07:58,249 --> 01:08:01,616
…所以我要出去大把花錢，做那些富人該做的事.
...so l'm out there spending money, doing what rich guys do.

740
01:08:02,253 --> 01:08:05,711
可這個員警，他想要他媽的添亂 不能讓他得逞.
This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try and fuck with you. Don't let him.

741
01:08:05,890 --> 01:08:10,020
- 你說起來容易. -蘇西，別崩潰.
-Yeah, that's easy for you to say. -Suzie, don't fall apart.

742
01:08:10,227 --> 01:08:13,094
能讓這事穿幫的，只有我們自己
The only people who can fuck this up is us.

743
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:24,031
你們--你們想要甩掉我，是不是?
You are gonna fuck me over, aren't you?

744
01:08:24,208 --> 01:08:26,233
去你的.
Oh, for chrissake.

745
01:08:26,410 --> 01:08:27,900
就是!
You are!

746
01:08:28,078 --> 01:08:32,481
你是低能啊，還是腦袋被沼氣熏昏啦?
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?

747
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:37,383
我也正想這麼說你--滿腦子泥漿，就像我媽媽一樣.
That's what l am to you, isn't it? Swamp trash, just like my mom.

748
01:08:38,622 --> 01:08:39,850
別碰我!
Don't!

749
01:08:43,694 --> 01:08:46,060
你個瓜批!
You stupid cunt!

750
01:09:18,262 --> 01:09:20,628
你很害怕，是嗎?
You are scared, aren't you?

751
01:10:45,349 --> 01:10:48,841
上帝啊!
Ray! Jesus Christ!

752
01:10:49,219 --> 01:10:51,210
- 你瘋了? - 你聽她在叫「薩姆」
-Are you crazy? -Hear her say ''Sam''?

753
01:10:51,522 --> 01:10:54,616
它們在和 倫巴多通電話.你看這兩個女孩
That was Lombardo on the phone. And you saw the two girls.

754
01:10:54,792 --> 01:10:57,124
磁帶上的談話莫名其妙
The conversation on the tape is unintelligible.

755
01:10:57,294 --> 01:10:59,888
我們現在有的只是你在范·賴安 的私人產業上
What we have here is you on the Van Ryan property...

756
01:11:00,064 --> 01:11:02,897
- 拍到的色情鏡頭! - 我真不能相信
-...shooting a porn flick! -l can't believe this.

757
01:11:03,067 --> 01:11:06,002
一個月前，這兩個女孩還在法庭上大打出手
A month ago, they threw things at each other in court.

758
01:11:06,170 --> 01:11:08,798
她們在演戲! 他們都在演戲!
They were acting! They were all acting!

759
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:10,804
我們卻相信它，深陷其中
We bought it, hook, line and sinker.

760
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:13,910
現在他們要帶著桑德拉·范·賴安的8百萬美金逃跑
They're getting away with $8 million from Sandra Van Ryan.

761
01:11:14,078 --> 01:11:16,774
她想保住的那些錢，她沒有計劃去毀掉這個男人的生活
She might have saved it if she didn't try to ruin him.

762
01:11:16,947 --> 01:11:20,178
如果你認為那小子強姦你的女兒，你還會去追求他?
You wouldn't go after a guy you thought raped your daughter?

763
01:11:20,351 --> 01:11:22,683
她也像我們一樣相信了那些鬼話!
She bought the same goddamn story we did!

764
01:11:22,853 --> 01:11:26,721
你們兩個聽著，你們不是在辦一個案子，因為現在沒有他媽的案子
Both of you, you're not on a case, because there is no fucking case!

765
01:11:27,191 --> 01:11:30,388
我很清楚桑德拉·范·賴安這個人，如果你繼續這樣在她家周圍晃來晃去…
l've had it with Sandra Van Ryan, and you keep mucking around...

766
01:11:30,561 --> 01:11:33,052
…那她一定會去控告我們非法侵入
...and she's gonna sue us for invasion of privacy.

767
01:11:33,230 --> 01:11:35,824
所以不要理這些人的事! 嘿! 雷!
So get out of these people's lives! Hey! Ray!

768
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:40,534
- 我說清楚啦? - 你覺得這只是涉及到錢?
-Hey! Am l getting through? -You think this is just about money?

769
01:11:40,704 --> 01:11:42,831
大概我們看起來很蠢?問問這個人吧
About us looking stupid? Question him.

770
01:11:43,941 --> 01:11:48,139
你會發現有個變態狂在背後控制，那些女孩將會走向死路
You'll find a manipulative psychopath, and those girls will wind up dead.

771
01:11:48,312 --> 01:11:49,711
給這個蠢貨一點事去做吧
Give him something to do.

772
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:52,542
- 也許該讓他去調查甘迺迪的謀殺案. - 我明白
-Look into the Kennedy assassination. -l understand.

773
01:11:52,716 --> 01:11:55,241
下次這個混蛋…
Next time this fucking piece of shit...

774
01:11:55,419 --> 01:11:57,444
再在這兒拖住我，我會去控告你
...drags me down here, l'm gonna sue you.

775
01:11:57,621 --> 01:11:59,953
這次你混蛋夠運，我最後一次放過你
You're goddamn lucky l didn't sue last time.

776
01:12:00,157 --> 01:12:02,216
- 我明白. - 我現在可以走啦?
-l agree. -Am l free to go?

777
01:12:02,393 --> 01:12:04,588
- 是的. - 謝謝
-Yes. -Thank you.

778
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:09,697
- 操蛋 - 你說什麼?
-Cocksucker. -Yeah, what was that?

779
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:13,564
- 你聽見啦，傻屄 - 你敢當我面再說一遍?
-You heard me, motherfucker. -Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?

780
01:12:17,241 --> 01:12:18,936
你看什麼呢?
What are you looking at?

781
01:13:02,986 --> 01:13:06,353
- 我猜我可能會被調離這裏. - 可以這麼說
-l guess l kind of lost it out there. -You could say that.

782
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:13,855
你有過這樣的事?你明知道有些事會發生…
Were you ever in a situation where you saw something coming...

783
01:13:14,031 --> 01:13:16,363
…而你可以阻止的，卻不去做你該做的
...and you didn't do what you could to stop it?

784
01:13:16,967 --> 01:13:18,332
我們都有此經歷
We all have.

785
01:13:18,502 --> 01:13:22,370
我是說你看到一件壞事，然後它發生了…
l mean something bad that you saw coming, and then it happened...

786
01:13:22,940 --> 01:13:26,171
可你卻什麼都不能做，而且--
...and you-- You didn't do anything, and....

787
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,111
我遇到過一次
l did that once.

788
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,245
我不想再來一次
l don't wanna do it again.

789
01:13:55,072 --> 01:13:57,370
我還以為我們要去看電影
l thought we were going to a movie.

790
01:13:59,743 --> 01:14:02,678
我想我們只是需要打發時間
l think we just need to get wasted.

791
01:14:03,313 --> 01:14:04,974
快來
Yeah.

792
01:14:22,799 --> 01:14:24,357
快來
Come on.

793
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:33,837
我希望有一天我能住在海邊
l wanna live at the beach someday.

794
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:35,873
噢，糟糕
Oh, shit.

795
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:38,742
我忘了鑰匙
l left the keys.

796
01:14:38,916 --> 01:14:40,474
我去拿
l'll get them.

797
01:15:00,270 --> 01:15:01,635
凱利?
Kelly?

798
01:15:01,805 --> 01:15:03,432
蘇西
Suzie.

799
01:15:05,943 --> 01:15:07,706
是我
lt's me.

800
01:15:12,516 --> 01:15:15,485
我很擔心你，所以我決定…
l was worried about you, and l decided...

801
01:15:15,652 --> 01:15:19,918
在分手之前，我們三個應該再聚最後一次
...the three of us should get together one last time before we split up.

802
01:15:20,524 --> 01:15:23,459
-你對我很生氣嗎? -不.不
-Are you mad at me? -No, no.

803
01:15:23,627 --> 01:15:26,061
我也許應該多告訴你一些關於…
l probably should've told you a bit more about...

804
01:15:26,230 --> 01:15:28,528
…我準備要演的角色
...the part l intended to play.

805
01:15:28,699 --> 01:15:30,633
但我們今晚要來一次
But we'll go through it again tonight.

806
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:38,864
慶祝一下，而不是自殺約會
This is a celebration, Suzie, not a suicide pact.

807
01:15:39,076 --> 01:15:42,978
我們要涼快一下只要放鬆一點…
We're gonna chill out and just relax...

808
01:15:43,146 --> 01:15:45,671
…來一點兒香檳…
...have a little champagne...

809
01:15:45,849 --> 01:15:47,646
…看看星星…
...watch the stars....

810
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:50,083
凱利?
Kelly?

811
01:15:50,254 --> 01:15:52,916
在你媽媽的車後備箱裏找到毯子啦?
You got a blanket in the back of your mom's Rover?

812
01:15:54,024 --> 01:15:57,016
行行好，再去幫我們拿來?
Why don't you be an angel and run over and get it for us?

813
01:15:59,630 --> 01:16:01,291
好姑娘
Good girl.

814
01:16:02,933 --> 01:16:05,458
給你說說我為我們精心挑選的這條船
Let me tell you about the boat l picked out for us.

815
01:17:08,799 --> 01:17:10,494
你還好?
You okay?

816
01:17:12,035 --> 01:17:15,334
要是我媽知道我開走她的車，她會殺了我的
My mom would kill me if she knew l took the Rover.

817
01:18:15,832 --> 01:18:17,060
四輪?
Been four-wheeling?

818
01:18:18,769 --> 01:18:21,237
-離開我的屋子! -我沒在你的屋子裏面
-Get off my property! -l'm not on your property.

819
01:18:21,405 --> 01:18:24,602
-如果你不離開這裏-- -你要報警麼?我就是員警!
-lf you don't get out of here-- -You'll call a cop? l am a cop!

820
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,436
我操!
Goddamn it!

821
01:18:48,398 --> 01:18:50,559
你是說她昨晚沒回家
So you say she didn't come home last night.

822
01:18:50,734 --> 01:18:55,034
她是一直說要去洛杉璣，但她的衣服全都在這裏
She's been talking about going to L.A., but her clothes are all still here.

823
01:18:55,205 --> 01:18:58,265
沃爾特! 你有病啊，它們用得好好的
Walter! You get sick, it'll serve you right.

824
01:19:01,044 --> 01:19:04,172
找些倒在路上的老流浪漢的的牙齒
Found some teeth in an old trailer down the road.

825
01:19:04,347 --> 01:19:06,406
他說他們很合適
He says they'll fit.

826
01:19:06,883 --> 01:19:10,546
審判結束後，蘇西就沒回學校
Suzie hasn't been back to school since the trial.

827
01:19:10,720 --> 01:19:14,417
哦，現在他們肯定在說她不能畢業
Oh, and now they're saying that she can't graduate.

828
01:19:14,591 --> 01:19:18,652
這都是 凱利 范·賴安帶她陷進去的，你們都知道
lt is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her into this whole mess, and you know it.

829
01:19:18,829 --> 01:19:21,024
我們會查的，魯比
Well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.

830
01:19:21,198 --> 01:19:24,190
如果我們發現什麼，你會第一個知道
We find something, you'll be the first to know.

831
01:19:25,669 --> 01:19:27,068
走啦
Come on.

832
01:19:45,522 --> 01:19:47,922
現在開始啦，格洛裏亞. 這就是開始
lt's starting, Gloria. This is how it begins.

833
01:19:48,091 --> 01:19:51,219
我們根本不知道什麼. 她也許在別的任何地方
Ray, we don't know anything yet. She could be anywhere.

834
01:19:51,394 --> 01:19:53,885
我會在警局放下你， 打電話查一下蘇西的車
l'll drop you off. Put a call out on Suzie's car.

835
01:19:54,064 --> 01:19:55,691
你要去什麼地方嗎?
You got someplace you wanna be?

836
01:19:56,533 --> 01:19:59,764
-你有約會? -你只要幫我查出這輛車
-You got a date? -Just check the car out for me.

837
01:20:09,513 --> 01:20:11,845
在那艘舊船那兒
lt's over here, by that old boat.

838
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:15,611
那你和蘇西來過這兒?
So you and Suzie used to come out here together?

839
01:20:15,785 --> 01:20:17,685
是的，有時候
Yeah, sometimes.

840
01:20:17,854 --> 01:20:20,288
有許多小子都來這兒
A lot of the kids hang out here.

841
01:20:21,892 --> 01:20:24,622
你真得覺得蘇西出事啦?
You really think something bad happened to Suzie?

842
01:20:25,161 --> 01:20:27,356
倫巴多來過這裏?
Lombardo ever come out here?

843
01:20:29,633 --> 01:20:31,362
我說了什麼好笑的事?
l say something funny?

844
01:20:31,535 --> 01:20:35,733
不是，我只是說，這樣想 倫巴多先生也太 --
No, but l mean, just the idea that Mr. Lombardo would--

845
01:20:35,906 --> 01:20:39,467
好吧，我聽到一些，他和孩子們的關係不錯
Well, the way l heard it, he was pretty tight with the kids.

846
01:20:39,643 --> 01:20:41,167
你和他是朋友對吧?
You and him were pals, right?

847
01:20:41,344 --> 01:20:44,609
是的，是他讓我來航行組的
Yeah, but he got me onto the sailing team.

848
01:20:44,781 --> 01:20:47,750
告訴我說我可以靠自己的努力完成學業，就像他那樣
Told me l could work my way through college, like he did.

849
01:20:47,918 --> 01:20:51,820
薩姆 倫巴多 是靠體育獎學金上的邁阿密大學…
Sam Lombardo went to the University of Miami on an athletic scholarship.

850
01:20:51,988 --> 01:20:55,947
這些船可跟這該死的事無關
Boats didn't have a damn thing to do with it.

851
01:21:46,509 --> 01:21:48,500
我會在這裏呆一會兒，孩子
Listen, l'm gonna be here a while, kid.

852
01:21:48,678 --> 01:21:51,511
你去高速公路上趕公共汽車吧?
Why don't you go up to the highway and catch the bus?

853
01:21:57,354 --> 01:21:58,981
嘿，吉米
Hey, Jimmy.

854
01:22:01,191 --> 01:22:05,628
人並不總像他外表的那樣. 記住這句話
People aren't always what they appear to be. Don't forget that.

855
01:22:23,079 --> 01:22:25,377
- 這就是作案現場. - 屍體在哪兒?
-This is where they did it. -Where's the body?

856
01:22:25,548 --> 01:22:27,641
在沼澤裏，很可能 這小子是個沼鼠
The swamp, most likely. Guy's a swamp rat.

857
01:22:27,817 --> 01:22:30,308
他知道在這裏屍體不會被發現， 但他犯了一個錯誤
He knows it won't be found, but he made a mistake.

858
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:34,287
她祖母說過她感到很危險，所以想跑掉…
She'd been threatening to run away and l found the car at the bus terminal.

859
01:22:34,457 --> 01:22:36,152
你不認為是山姆把它停在那裏的?我在公共汽車總站發現她的汽車
You don't think Sam put it there?

860
01:22:36,326 --> 01:22:39,557
稍等一下. 格洛裏亞，給那輛車噴點灰取印模
Hold on a second. Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.

861
01:22:39,729 --> 01:22:43,130
如果蘇西真的被謀殺， 一定是那個范·賴安 小混蛋幹的
And if Suzie even was murdered, it was that damn Van Ryan kid.

862
01:22:43,299 --> 01:22:45,494
一個小叛逆從一開始就註定啦
Little sociopath's the one who started this.

863
01:22:45,669 --> 01:22:48,729
- 我們多長時間可以拿到結果? - 我們可以立刻拿到血型的報告
-How long till we get something? -We can get blood type now.

864
01:22:48,905 --> 01:22:52,397
核對牙齒記錄時間要長些. DNA的測試結果要幾個星期
Dental records will take longer. DNA could take weeks.

865
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,001
可憐的笨蘇西. 從來不曾有過機會
Poor, dumb Suzie. Kid never had a chance.

866
01:22:56,179 --> 01:22:58,841
- 我們還不知道什麼. - 讓我告訴你，凱利 就是下一個
-We don't know that. -l'm telling you, Kelly's next.

867
01:22:59,015 --> 01:23:02,815
讓我來告訴你，離開這裏… 馬上
l'm telling you, you get off this right now.

868
01:23:03,086 --> 01:23:07,250
別他媽的讓我聽到你再去打擾倫巴多
Don't even fucking let me hear about you bothering Lombardo.

869
01:23:10,727 --> 01:23:12,217
大衛
David!

870
01:23:12,395 --> 01:23:14,761
你拿到身份報告，直接通知我!
You get an lD, you call me!

871
01:23:17,133 --> 01:23:18,361
幫我一個忙好不好?
Will you do me a favor?

872
01:23:19,569 --> 01:23:21,161
雷，你聽到他說的
Ray, you heard him.

873
01:23:21,337 --> 01:23:24,306
他只是說讓我不要碰倫巴多， 關於你他倒是什麼都沒說
He told me to stay away. He didn't say anything about you.

874
01:23:24,474 --> 01:23:26,965
想想如果我正確而亨特錯怎樣
What if l'm right and Hunter's wrong?

875
01:23:27,143 --> 01:23:29,611
求你，這次你得幫我
Please, you gotta help me out on this, partner.

876
01:23:30,013 --> 01:23:33,312
如果這牙齒不是蘇西的， 你得放棄這想法?
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's, you'll give this up?

877
01:23:34,584 --> 01:23:38,486
如果這次我錯，我聽你的
lf l'm wrong about those teeth, you got my word.

878
01:24:21,931 --> 01:24:24,661
-喂? -我給你你打過電話.
-Hello? -I've been calling you.

879
01:24:24,834 --> 01:24:26,631
-我想見你. -你在哪兒?
-l wanna see you. -Where are you?

880
01:24:26,803 --> 01:24:29,465
-這該死的客人房 -好的.呆在那兒.
-The stupid guest house. -Good. Stay there.

881
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:31,436
薩姆，我真的很緊張
Sam, l'm really nervous.

882
01:24:31,941 --> 01:24:34,205
凱利，放鬆點
Kelly, relax.

883
01:24:34,511 --> 01:24:36,979
吃一片你媽媽的鎮靜藥什麼的
Take one of your mom's Valiums or something.

884
01:24:37,147 --> 01:24:40,844
一個星期後，當你乘上飛機， 這些就結束了.我們就有錢啦
ln a week, you get on the plane, this is over. We're rich.

885
01:24:41,017 --> 01:24:43,144
但是如果他們發現了呢?
But what if they find out?

886
01:24:43,453 --> 01:24:46,183
上帝，他們會把你推上電椅
My God, they'd put you in the electric chair.

887
01:24:46,356 --> 01:24:47,789
聽著，凱利…
Look, Kelly...

888
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:50,858
…今晚呆在那裏，想想畢業舞會
...stay in the guest house, skip the graduation parties.

889
01:24:51,294 --> 01:24:53,558
我非常愛你
l love you so much.

890
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:55,698
我也愛你，凱利.
And I love you too, Kelly.

891
01:24:55,865 --> 01:24:57,833
做個好姑娘 呆在那兒.
Be a good girl and stay where you are.

892
01:25:20,990 --> 01:25:23,481
在別人的窗戶外面偷窺…
Peeping in people's windows?

893
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:25,593
…是不是違法的?
lsn't that against the law?

894
01:25:27,463 --> 01:25:29,226
蘇西·托樂 失蹤了
Suzie Toller's missing.

895
01:25:30,300 --> 01:25:32,928
- 什麼時候? - 她昨晚沒有回家
-Since when? -She didn't come home last night.

896
01:25:33,269 --> 01:25:36,067
我們在公共汽車終點站發現她的汽車
We found her car at the bus terminal.

897
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:38,034
雷 認為她已被害
Ray thinks she was murdered.

898
01:25:38,775 --> 01:25:40,902
我不知道該說什麼
Well, l don't know what to tell you.

899
01:25:42,645 --> 01:25:45,512
你可以告訴我你昨晚在哪兒
You could tell me where you were last night.

900
01:25:46,015 --> 01:25:49,280
我想我能告訴你， 但我真得沒必要這麼做，是不是?
l suppose l could, but l don't really have to, now, do l?

901
01:25:52,388 --> 01:25:53,616
來這兒
Come here.

902
01:25:54,958 --> 01:25:57,085
我給你看樣東西
l wanna show you something.

903
01:26:08,338 --> 01:26:10,397
看起來像是準備離開
Looks like goodbye.

904
01:26:11,074 --> 01:26:12,837
凱利的檔案
Kelly's file.

905
01:26:13,076 --> 01:26:16,842
讀讀看. 你會發現這是個憤怒的，性困惑的女孩…
Read it. You're gonna find an angry, sexually confused girl...

906
01:26:17,013 --> 01:26:19,538
…至少有兩個人使得她對生活產生恐懼
...who threatened the lives of at least two people.

907
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:21,149
哪兩個人?
What two people?

908
01:26:21,317 --> 01:26:23,512
其中一個是她母親
One of them was her mother.

909
01:26:23,753 --> 01:26:25,744
另一個是…
The other one was...

910
01:26:27,123 --> 01:26:28,647
…她的一個女同學…
...a female classmate...

911
01:26:30,260 --> 01:26:32,922
…和她可能有些複雜的性關係
...she may have been sexually involved with.

912
01:26:34,030 --> 01:26:35,554
蘇西?
Suzie?

913
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:39,201
現在你拿著這個檔案
Now you got the file.

914
01:26:39,702 --> 01:26:41,135
看看它
Read it.

915
01:26:41,971 --> 01:26:45,134
我想它會讓你對此事有新的看法
l think it'll give you a new perspective on things.

916
01:26:46,276 --> 01:26:49,643
為什麼你在審訊前不告訴我們這些?
Why didn't you tell us about this before the trial?

917
01:26:51,681 --> 01:26:54,479
因為那時我還有些個人守則
Because then l had principles.

918
01:26:54,651 --> 01:26:56,482
對我來說很重要的
That meant a lot to me.

919
01:26:58,521 --> 01:26:59,954
但現在…
Now...

920
01:27:01,424 --> 01:27:03,358
…我不再在乎
...l don't care.

921
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,704
我也許應該走
l should probably go now.

922
01:27:22,345 --> 01:27:25,314
除非你打算找些什麼事留住我
Unless you're planning on holding me for something.

923
01:27:52,775 --> 01:27:55,767
-杜奎特.發生什麼事? -我很累.我回家啦.
-Duquette. What's happening? -I'm tired. I'm going home.

924
01:27:55,945 --> 01:27:57,435
-倫巴多在哪? -走了…
-Where's Lombardo? -He's gone.

925
01:27:57,613 --> 01:28:00,810
日，格洛裏亞，岩石上的血型跟蘇西吻合
Goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type on the rocks matches Suzie's.

926
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,043
我來告訴你一些事情，雷:
Let me tell you something, Ray:

927
01:28:03,219 --> 01:28:05,244
關於這件事，有許多是你不清楚的
There's more to this story than you know.

928
01:28:05,421 --> 01:28:06,979
如果蘇西死掉了…
If Suzie is dead...

929
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:09,590
…亨特 可能要盯上 凱利.
...Hunter may be on the right track about Kelly.

930
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:13,318
雷?
Ray?

931
01:28:14,497 --> 01:28:16,931
混蛋，雷
Shit, Ray.

932
01:28:26,242 --> 01:28:29,370
-是誰? -杜奎特偵探
-Who is it? -lt's Detective Duquette.

933
01:28:29,545 --> 01:28:31,410
開門
Open the gate, now.

934
01:29:02,779 --> 01:29:04,940
-你好，凱利. -你來這兒幹什麼?
-Hello, Kelly. -What are you doing here?

935
01:29:23,232 --> 01:29:26,668
哪裏--? 凱利! 凱利!
Where's--? Kelly! Kelly!

936
01:29:34,243 --> 01:29:38,009
我只是剛一轉眼，也就一眨眼的時間
l just looked away for a second, just a split second.

937
01:29:38,314 --> 01:29:41,112
就是那樣-- 就來啦--
And just like that, bingo...

938
01:29:41,451 --> 01:29:43,646
…她用膝蓋頂我的腹股溝
...she put a knee in my groin.

939
01:29:43,820 --> 01:29:46,618
我開始沒倒下，慢慢地往下-----
l didn't go down, but it slowed me down...

940
01:29:47,123 --> 01:29:48,852
…就這樣
...just enough.

941
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:51,450
我碰不到她
l couldn't get to her.

942
01:29:52,295 --> 01:29:54,320
她拿把槍對著我
She turned on me with the gun.

943
01:29:56,466 --> 01:29:58,627
開一槍
Fired one shot.

944
01:29:59,635 --> 01:30:01,262
我躲一下打中肩膀
l took the hit in the shoulder.

945
01:30:04,640 --> 01:30:06,574
我沒別的選擇
l had no choice.

946
01:30:10,446 --> 01:30:11,777
只能開槍還擊
l had to return fire.

947
01:30:13,516 --> 01:30:17,111
兩槍，我想是，打中胸部
Two rounds, l think, in the chest.

948
01:30:20,857 --> 01:30:23,121
我去那兒是想保護她的
l went there to protect her.

949
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:28,522
我--我去那兒是想保護她的
l went-- l went there to protect her.

950
01:30:28,698 --> 01:30:30,427
杜奎特偵探
Detective Duquette.

951
01:30:30,600 --> 01:30:34,127
我曾在軍事情報局幹過一段時間， 在那兒我們有個說法:
l spent time in military intelligence, and we had a saying there:

952
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:37,568
一次是偶然. 兩次是巧合
''Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence.

953
01:30:37,740 --> 01:30:39,833
三次是敵意
Three times is enemy action.''

954
01:30:40,009 --> 01:30:42,034
你現在已經兩次，杜奎特…
This is twice for you, Duquette...

955
01:30:42,211 --> 01:30:45,510
所以我不想看到第三次
...and l intend to see to it that there is no third time.

956
01:30:45,982 --> 01:30:49,850
我們調查認為你打的很準， 這個有點無關緊要
Our investigation finds that this was a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.

957
01:30:50,019 --> 01:30:52,749
但你忽視上級的指示
You ignored the advice of your superiors.

958
01:30:52,922 --> 01:30:55,789
從而，造成兩個年輕女孩的死亡
Consequently, two young women are dead.

959
01:30:56,392 --> 01:31:00,453
從現在開始，你被停職. 同時終止你的養老金和福利金
You are, as of now, terminated, with forfeiture of pension and benefits.

960
01:31:00,630 --> 01:31:02,291
勾賽爾局長…
Chief Goodsall...

961
01:31:02,465 --> 01:31:06,697
…杜奎特偵探發現 蘇珊·瑪麗·托樂的牙齒和血跡…
...Detective Duquette found Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...

962
01:31:06,869 --> 01:31:09,337
就在被叫做碎石海灘的地方
...near the area known as Stoner Beach.

963
01:31:09,505 --> 01:31:12,736
越野車裏也發現托樂的血跡
Miss Toller's blood was also found in the Van Ryan Range Rover.

964
01:31:12,909 --> 01:31:15,901
這讓警方認為…
This has led this office to conclude...

965
01:31:16,245 --> 01:31:19,703
蘇珊·瑪麗·托樂 是被 凱利·拉尼爾·范·賴安謀殺的
...that Susan Marie Toller was murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.

966
01:31:20,883 --> 01:31:23,215
她- 她沒有
She-- She didn't.

967
01:31:25,655 --> 01:31:27,350
杜奎特先生
Mr. Duquette.

968
01:31:27,823 --> 01:31:29,484
杜奎特先生
Mr. Duquette.

969
01:31:29,926 --> 01:31:33,555
調查結束 你可以走啦
This investigation is concluded. You're dismissed.

970
01:31:59,922 --> 01:32:01,651
謝謝你，保羅
Thank you, Paul.

971
01:32:56,412 --> 01:32:57,640
你好啊，搭檔
Howdy, partner.

972
01:32:59,548 --> 01:33:03,416
上帝啊，你這傢伙.我還以為你明天來
Jesus, man. l wasn't expecting you until tomorrow.

973
01:33:07,156 --> 01:33:09,056
看，你的好女友打的
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.

974
01:33:09,225 --> 01:33:11,716
凱利本來只是要當個頂罪的
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.

975
01:33:11,894 --> 01:33:13,794
這婊子開槍打我
The bitch shot me.

976
01:33:13,963 --> 01:33:17,455
該死，你是個員警. 難道他們沒有教你讓人解除武器?
Shit, you're a cop. Don't they teach you to disarm people?

977
01:33:17,633 --> 01:33:20,124
你知道 打腿或者類似地方?
You know, shoot them in the leg or something?

978
01:33:20,303 --> 01:33:23,636
你忽然有點多愁善感啊
Did you become squeamish about this stuff before or after...

979
01:33:23,806 --> 01:33:27,037
…是在你用葡萄酒瓶當敲死小蘇西之前還是之後?
...you bludgeoned little Suzie to death with a wine bottle?

980
01:33:27,209 --> 01:33:30,667
我們沒有安排凱利 死掉，雷. 這不是計畫裏的
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray. lt wasn't part of the plan.

981
01:33:30,846 --> 01:33:35,340
夥計，事情也不會更好啦. 他們相信是凱利謀殺的蘇西
lt couldn't have worked out better. They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.

982
01:33:35,518 --> 01:33:37,349
我不能告訴他們實情
l couldn't talk them out of it.

983
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,511
我只想告訴你，我不喜歡意外
l'm telling you, l don't like surprises.

984
01:33:39,722 --> 01:33:43,658
你應該這樣看這件事:每朵烏雲都有金邊
Look at it this way: Every cloud has a silver lining.

985
01:33:43,826 --> 01:33:45,760
現在再不會有破綻
Now there's no loose ends.

986
01:33:45,928 --> 01:33:49,420
明天來，你就再也別看到我
Come tomorrow, you'll never see me again.

987
01:33:49,598 --> 01:33:53,090
好吧，聽聽看，要明天
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...

988
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:57,233
…我已經對銀行講過但他們說， 需要兩個工作日…
...l spoke to the bank and they said it's gonna take two working days...

989
01:33:58,441 --> 01:34:00,238
…來完成轉帳，所以--
...to make the transfer, so....

990
01:34:00,409 --> 01:34:01,933
-胡說 -哦，是的
-Bullshit. -Oh, yeah.

991
01:34:02,111 --> 01:34:03,806
你可以自己打電話
Call them yourself.

992
01:34:04,213 --> 01:34:08,309
不管怎樣，還急啥呢? 等個一兩天
Anyway, what's your hurry? Kick back for a day or two.

993
01:34:08,484 --> 01:34:12,511
我們駕船出海吧. 我剛把船裝配好
We'll take out the boat. l just had it outfitted.

994
01:34:13,089 --> 01:34:14,954
我也許還需要個水手
l could use a deck hand.

995
01:34:20,396 --> 01:34:22,864
這是兩個大筆的銀行帳戶
Here's to large bank accounts.

996
01:34:25,267 --> 01:34:28,759
你應該輕鬆一下，夥伴. 你是個富人了
You gotta lighten up, partner. You're a rich man.

997
01:34:32,074 --> 01:34:35,237
兩個大筆的帳戶，而且毫無破綻
To large accounts and no loose ends.

998
01:34:36,145 --> 01:34:38,010
毫無破綻
And no loose ends.

999
01:34:56,399 --> 01:34:59,300
嘿，雷，看見那個絞盤啦?
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?

1000
01:35:00,803 --> 01:35:03,067
拿這個工具去擰一下. 船要全速向風
Take a couple turns on it. She's luffing.

1001
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,471
- 你是說那個東西? - 沒錯. 雷
-You mean that thing? -Yeah, Ray.

1002
01:35:09,645 --> 01:35:13,775
我們管它叫絞盤，用它來拉緊船帆
We call it a winch. lt's what we use to tighten the sails.

1003
01:35:13,949 --> 01:35:18,079
- 那為什麼不開始幹呢? - 我們把這看成一個假期呀
-So why don't you start cranking? -This is supposed to be a vacation.

1004
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:20,245
為什麼你不去弄艘好的機動船呢?
Why don't you get a nice powerboat?

1005
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:23,585
來啊，雷. 我會讓你成為一個真正的水手的
Come on, Ray. l'll make a sailor out of you yet.

1006
01:35:24,527 --> 01:35:26,358
或者讓我淹死
Or get me drowned.

1007
01:35:40,476 --> 01:35:41,704
它鏽住啦
lt's stuck.

1008
01:35:41,877 --> 01:35:45,108
你說什麼?鏽住? 稍微用點兒力吧
What do you mean, it's stuck? Put a little elbow grease in it.

1009
01:35:49,385 --> 01:35:50,977
鏽住啦，我告訴過你
lt's stuck, l'm telling you.

1010
01:35:52,855 --> 01:35:55,119
得把帆腳索綁在什麼東西上
The jenny sheet must be caught on something.

1011
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:58,556
那你去右舷看看你是否能把它解下來?
Why don't you go starboard and see if you can unhook it?

1012
01:35:58,727 --> 01:36:02,219
- 你說的我一句也聽不懂. - 好吧，雷
-l don't understand a word you said. -Okay, Ray.

1013
01:36:02,398 --> 01:36:05,367
你看見那根繩子? 看看它下頭…
You see this line right here? Follow it down...

1014
01:36:05,534 --> 01:36:08,162
看看它是否被什麼纏住
...and see if you can see what it's snagged on.

1015
01:36:09,939 --> 01:36:11,497
你會害死我
You're killing me.

1016
01:36:20,249 --> 01:36:24,208
-這個東西? -就是它.就在那兒
-You mean this thing? -That's it. That one right there.

1017
01:36:24,620 --> 01:36:26,611
看到東西了麼?
You see anything?

1018
01:36:29,558 --> 01:36:31,423
再向下看一點兒
Look a little lower.

1019
01:36:31,694 --> 01:36:32,922
就這樣
That's it.

1020
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:44,529
我忘告訴你，雷:
Guess l forgot to tell you, Ray:

1021
01:36:46,242 --> 01:36:48,733
一隻手管船， 一隻手管自己
One hand for the boat, the other one for yourself.

1022
01:36:49,144 --> 01:36:51,271
航海的第一準則
First rule of sailing.

1023
01:37:16,572 --> 01:37:17,834
雷!
Ray!

1024
01:37:18,007 --> 01:37:20,635
-怎樣啦? -很不錯啊，操他奶奶的
-What happened? -Nice try, motherfucker!

1025
01:37:29,785 --> 01:37:31,412
是你!
You!

1026
01:37:32,054 --> 01:37:34,045
你已經死啦
You're dead!

1027
01:37:34,256 --> 01:37:35,723
不，我沒死
No, l'm not.

1028
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:39,827
薩姆
Sam.

1029
01:37:39,995 --> 01:37:43,487
-薩姆，該死的! -對不起，搭檔
-Sam, for chrissake! -Sorry, partner.

1030
01:37:43,666 --> 01:37:46,226
你真的不該殺凱利
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.

1031
01:37:46,402 --> 01:37:49,769
你也不該在那片沼澤地裏殺死那個孩子
You shouldn't have killed that kid out in the glades either.

1032
01:37:49,939 --> 01:37:52,772
-他的名字? -大衛
-What was his name? -Davy.

1033
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:07,548
那是我兒子沃爾特，沃爾特
That's my son, Walter.

1034
01:38:07,723 --> 01:38:12,820
他做這工作很久，所以你們不用害怕. 請吧，請進
He's been doing this a long time, so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.

1035
01:38:12,995 --> 01:38:16,396
謝謝光臨沼澤地
Thank you so much for coming down to the glades.

1036
01:38:29,378 --> 01:38:34,281
你是來這裏看沃爾特表演的，還是公事?
Did you come here to watch Walter, or is this an official visit?

1037
01:38:34,550 --> 01:38:36,711
不，事實上，今天我休息
No. Actually, it's my day off.

1038
01:38:38,554 --> 01:38:40,283
我覺得你看起來不大一樣
l thought you looked different.

1039
01:38:40,456 --> 01:38:43,016
我來這兒是因為我希望你能跟我說說
l came because l was hoping you would talk to me.

1040
01:38:44,560 --> 01:38:45,857
關於蘇西?
About Suzie?

1041
01:38:46,028 --> 01:38:49,794
事實上，我希望你能說說雷 杜奎特
Actually, l was wondering if you would talk to me about Ray Duquette.

1042
01:38:55,237 --> 01:38:57,762
他過去常來這裏
He used to come around here.

1043
01:38:58,607 --> 01:39:01,974
他跟其中的一個女孩有些關係--
He had a thing going with one of the girls--

1044
01:39:02,144 --> 01:39:05,705
沼澤地周圍這些女孩
Girls. Over at the glades.

1045
01:39:06,548 --> 01:39:10,143
從我聽到的好像是跟她鬼混
Got sort of hung up on her, from what l hear.

1046
01:39:10,886 --> 01:39:14,617
- 她仍在那兒工作? - 從那晚以後就沒有
-She still work there? -Not after that night.

1047
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:17,351
我只知道，第二天早上…
All l know is, the next morning...

1048
01:39:17,526 --> 01:39:21,462
她離開，但一個男孩死啦
...she was gone and a boy was dead.

1049
01:39:21,630 --> 01:39:27,068
是個塞米諾爾族人，名字叫大衛. 他迷上雷的婊子
Seminole kid named Davy. He had a crush on Ray's whore.

1050
01:39:30,439 --> 01:39:34,705
他看到雷抽她，他想管一檔
Caught Ray slapping her around, and he tried to stop it.

1051
01:39:35,711 --> 01:39:38,578
所以雷把他殺啦
So Ray killed him.

1052
01:39:39,348 --> 01:39:41,578
蘇西 看到
Suzie saw it.

1053
01:39:41,917 --> 01:39:45,785
所以他逮捕她，然後又保釋她
So he busted her and sent her up.

1054
01:39:45,954 --> 01:39:50,618
你知道那僅僅為證明他有這個能力
You know, just to prove that he could.

1055
01:39:51,360 --> 01:39:54,420
雷 杜奎特就是這樣的
That's all there is to say about Ray Duquette.

1056
01:40:05,574 --> 01:40:07,542
為雷
To Ray.

1057
01:40:07,910 --> 01:40:11,539
我們贏啦薩姆，現在結束啦
We won. Sam, it's over.

1058
01:40:19,021 --> 01:40:23,355
像個妄想狂 看看我們周圍，薩姆
Wow. Talk about paranoid. Take a look around us, Sam.

1059
01:40:23,525 --> 01:40:27,723
即使我要除掉你，你也要先教會我操縱這船啊
You're gonna have to teach me how to drive this before l can get rid of you.

1060
01:40:39,374 --> 01:40:40,773
好吧，托樂
Okay, Toller.

1061
01:40:40,943 --> 01:40:43,673
我想整好船帆. 抓住那個絞盤
l wanna trim the sail. Grab a hold of that winch.

1062
01:40:44,580 --> 01:40:48,448
-去它的絞盤.我想要駕駛. -不是那樣的
-Fuck the winch. l wanna drive. -lt doesn't work that way.

1063
01:40:48,617 --> 01:40:50,744
你不是駕駛它，你要使它揚帆航行
You don't drive it, you sail it.

1064
01:40:51,754 --> 01:40:53,949
現在去抓住絞盤
Now, get on that winch.

1065
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:57,991
我想要巡航一會兒
l just wanna cruise for a while.

1066
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:06,193
這很有意思. 這是我注意到你的第一件事，薩姆
That's funny. That's one of the first things l noticed about you, Sam.

1067
01:41:06,368 --> 01:41:09,269
你喜歡巡航
You like to cruise.

1068
01:41:10,906 --> 01:41:14,774
-蘇西. -拿大學期間舉個例子
-Suzie. -Take college, for instance.

1069
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:19,937
我打賭你在那兒選修的課程都是多項選擇的結果
l bet the classes you took were ones where the finals were multiple choice.

1070
01:41:20,716 --> 01:41:24,379
而且你從不買書. 你只是尋找一個女孩…
And you never bought the book. You'd find a girl to loan you hers.

1071
01:41:24,553 --> 01:41:28,284
她把書借給你，然後你跟她上床，對不對?
And then, of course, you'd have to fuck her after that, right?

1072
01:41:28,457 --> 01:41:29,947
是這樣度過的?
ls that how it went?

1073
01:41:32,928 --> 01:41:34,395
是的
Yeah.

1074
01:41:36,765 --> 01:41:39,598
好吧，我現在有個測試題來問你
Well, l've got a good pop quiz for you.

1075
01:41:39,768 --> 01:41:41,861
當然也是多重選擇
Multiple choice, of course.

1076
01:41:43,205 --> 01:41:44,866
在駕船逃向赫利俄斯之前…
Before sailing on the Helios...

1077
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:50,637
…美狄亞殺死克瑞翁王和公主… 用的是什麼?
...Medea killed King Creon and the princess with what?

1078
01:41:51,113 --> 01:41:52,740
一塊石頭…
A rock?

1079
01:41:53,649 --> 01:41:55,378
一把長矛，還是…
A spear gun?

1080
01:41:57,419 --> 01:41:58,977
一點兒毒藥?
Or a little poison?

1081
01:41:59,855 --> 01:42:01,948
毒藥!
Poison!

1082
01:42:05,761 --> 01:42:07,319
猜的好
Good guess.

1083
01:42:21,476 --> 01:42:23,205
范·賴安老了
Van Ryan got old.

1084
01:42:23,812 --> 01:42:26,337
他和他的老友會來這裏
He and his cronies would come here.

1085
01:42:26,515 --> 01:42:30,611
狩獵和嫖娼. 真他媽的狗屎
Hunt and whore. They acted like a bunch of assholes.

1086
01:42:30,986 --> 01:42:33,580
一次旅行，他和這個女孩出現了…
One trip, he showed up with this girl...

1087
01:42:33,755 --> 01:42:37,020
…他從某地溝上她
...he'd picked up somewhere.

1088
01:42:37,192 --> 01:42:39,285
並讓他懷孕
Gotten her pregnant.

1089
01:42:40,329 --> 01:42:42,661
在沼澤地宰了她
Dumped her in the swamp.

1090
01:42:42,998 --> 01:42:44,966
可憐的姑娘死了一年…
Poor girl was dead in a year.

1091
01:42:48,403 --> 01:42:52,237
和她一起
That came with her.

1092
01:42:52,841 --> 01:42:54,604
小孩呢?
And the child?

1093
01:42:54,776 --> 01:42:58,405
在她喝死自己之前已經有了
Well, she had it. Before she drank herself to death.

1094
01:42:59,948 --> 01:43:02,940
確實不是個可愛的小孩
Wasn't exactly a love child.

1095
01:43:14,062 --> 01:43:16,622
所以你不是她奶奶
So you're not her grandmother.

1096
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:20,793
我培養了他像我一樣
l raised her like l was.

1097
01:43:21,336 --> 01:43:25,568
但是.不.沃爾特是我唯一的孩子，一個好男孩
But, no. Walt was my only child. He was a good boy.

1098
01:43:25,741 --> 01:43:27,902
直到他參軍
Until the Army took him.

1099
01:43:28,076 --> 01:43:31,637
所以蘇西 還有桑德拉·范·賴安算是半個姐妹
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan were half sisters.

1100
01:43:32,180 --> 01:43:36,549
另一個女孩，凱利? 蘇西的外甥女
And the other girl, Kelly? Suzie's niece.

1101
01:43:47,262 --> 01:43:51,289
這算是好消息還是壞消息. 我不知道.我們會用信件開始
Well, it may be good news or not. I don't know. We'll start with the letter.

1102
01:43:51,466 --> 01:43:54,958
-H. -是的.兩個H.
-H. -Yes, there are two H's.

1103
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:20,225
卡車不錯啊
Nice truck.

1104
01:44:28,203 --> 01:44:29,966
要賣你的船?
Selling your boat?

1105
01:44:35,043 --> 01:44:37,341
這個是蘇西的船
This was Suzie's boat.

1106
01:44:38,013 --> 01:44:40,504
我猜她現在不需要它啦
Guess she won't be needing it now.

1107
01:44:42,317 --> 01:44:46,378
真奇怪… 我從未想到蘇西會是個水手
Funny. l wouldn't have guessed Suzie was a sailor.

1108
01:44:48,757 --> 01:44:52,921
老女人給她做過一次測試 她們說她的智商很高
Old lady had her tested once. They said her lQ was way up there.

1109
01:44:53,095 --> 01:44:56,963
大概是200或類似這些玩意
Around 200 or some such shit.

1110
01:44:57,132 --> 01:45:00,624
她只要用心可以作好任何事
That girl could do just about anything she put her mind to.

1111
01:46:12,340 --> 01:46:14,035
嘿
Hi.

1112
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:16,608
你幹什麼?
What are you doing out here?

1113
01:46:17,546 --> 01:46:19,810
我準備離開
l'm running away.

1114
01:46:20,615 --> 01:46:22,776
你認為這樣明智麼?
You think that's wise?

1115
01:46:25,620 --> 01:46:27,952
猜猜還有什麼
Guess what else?

1116
01:46:30,992 --> 01:46:32,960
我有玩具
l have toys.

1117
01:46:37,999 --> 01:46:40,126
我建議一次嘗鮮不要去傷害
l suppose one taste won't hurt.

1118
01:46:51,613 --> 01:46:53,137
你知道麼…
You know...

1119
01:46:53,315 --> 01:46:56,807
我被抓住的時候，我給你打過一百次電話
...that weekend l got busted, l called you about a hundred times.

1120
01:47:01,490 --> 01:47:05,426
我真的以為你這個廢物是我的朋友
l really believed that stuff about you being my friend.

1121
01:47:07,762 --> 01:47:09,059
我太天真
Was l naive.

1122
01:47:13,568 --> 01:47:15,627
我不知道怎樣照的更好:
l can't decide what came out better.

1123
01:47:15,804 --> 01:47:21,174
在凱利鼻子上面粘些小草 還是找個狗項圈套在你脖子上
That little straw up Kelly's nose or that dildo shoved up her ass.

1124
01:47:22,344 --> 01:47:24,835
你覺得怎樣 倫巴多先生?
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

1125
01:47:39,161 --> 01:47:41,595
看起來好像是你做過同樣的事情
Seems to like the same places you do.

1126
01:47:42,130 --> 01:47:46,692
-有趣吧，你過去從未見過. -是的，真得有趣
-Funny you never met. -Yeah, real funny.

1127
01:47:46,868 --> 01:47:51,328
你知道嗎，這點上你想的不對 我會在現場被逮捕
You know, you're wrong about this, and l could get busted on the spot.

1128
01:47:52,307 --> 01:47:56,971
信我.這個小子很壞.他喜歡做那些壞事，他愛那些事. 特別是殺死我的那個安排
Trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it. Especially the part about killing me.

1129
01:47:57,145 --> 01:48:00,603
現在走吧. 去找個新朋友吧
Now, get out of here. Go make yourself a new friend.

1130
01:48:12,861 --> 01:48:15,022
你在喝什麼呢?
What are you drinking?

1131
01:48:19,100 --> 01:48:21,864
我們準備停了.我來了高潮
We gotta stop. l'm gonna come.

1132
01:48:23,905 --> 01:48:27,136
從未在沼澤擔心你
That never seemed to worry you at the glades.

1133
01:48:28,710 --> 01:48:33,875
-不是你的線…. -說你愛我
-That's not your line.... -Say you love me.

1134
01:48:35,450 --> 01:48:39,546
我愛你. 給我
l love you. Now, give me the line.

1135
01:48:39,721 --> 01:48:43,316
小女孩不會給我高潮的…
No little girl can ever make me come.

1136
01:48:56,905 --> 01:49:01,001
你的鉗子夾的太緊 你會把這證物弄碎的
You got the pressure too tight. You're gonna crush the evidence.

1137
01:49:05,547 --> 01:49:08,209
噢，該死的
Oh, for chrissake.

1138
01:49:23,265 --> 01:49:25,665
- 你好，凱利 - 你來這兒幹什麼?
-Hello, Kelly. -What are you doing here?

1139
01:50:12,781 --> 01:50:14,681
可以問你個問題嗎，托樂小姐?
May l ask you a question, Ms. Toller?

1140
01:50:17,218 --> 01:50:20,381
你喜歡來法庭做客嗎?
Did you enjoy being a guest of the state?

1141
01:50:23,091 --> 01:50:24,956
我希望我沒使你瘋狂
l hope l never make you mad.

1142
01:50:28,897 --> 01:50:31,559
現金是讓你周遊世界的
Cash is just walking-around money.

1143
01:50:32,200 --> 01:50:34,395
支票是帳戶上剩餘的錢…
The check is the balance of the numbered account...

1144
01:50:34,569 --> 01:50:37,037
…除去留給魯比  和沃爾特的一百萬…
...minus the million we set aside for Ruby and Walter...

1145
01:50:37,205 --> 01:50:38,866
…還有一點我的常規收費
...less my usual fee.

1146
01:50:40,775 --> 01:50:42,436
案子結束
Case closed.

1147
01:50:54,622 --> 01:50:56,419
蘇西
Suzie.

1148
01:50:59,060 --> 01:51:01,051
好好過
Be good.
