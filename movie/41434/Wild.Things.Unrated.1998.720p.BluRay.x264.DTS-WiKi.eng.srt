1
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:55,269
Forget it, loser.

2
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,827
Forget it, loser.

3
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,995
Oh, Mr. Lombardo.

4
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,867
-Hey.
-Hey, bro.

5
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:03,374
Mr. Lombardo, what's up?

6
00:04:04,045 --> 00:04:06,309
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

7
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,277
Jennifer--

8
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,920
Did you see his eyes?

9
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,145
What are you looking at, dork?

10
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,951
Fuck off.

11
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:47,716
l appreciate you guys coming down.

12
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,020
The only thing l'm gonna miss
in this dump is....

13
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:54,992
Settle down.

14
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,591
Settle down.

15
00:04:58,099 --> 00:05:03,196
Well, we've come to the halfway point
of our senior seminars.

16
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:08,205
Settle down.
Settle down.

17
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:11,641
-Beats study hall, doesn't it?
-No!

18
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,746
-That you, Jimmy?
-At least in study hall l can meditate.

19
00:05:16,917 --> 00:05:19,078
What he means is, ''masturbate.''

20
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,918
Something with which l'm sure you've
had hands-on experience, Kirk.

21
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,244
lt wasn't me, man.
lt wasn't me.

22
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:54,519
l'm innocent.
l'm innocent.

23
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:59,625
We've all heard the terms
''date rape,'' ''sexual harassment.''

24
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:04,387
We've discussed some of these issues
right here in this very room.

25
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:08,932
Our guests today come from
the Blue Bay Police Department.

26
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:13,067
Detectives Duquette and Perez...

27
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,105
...are here to give us
what we hope...

28
00:06:15,276 --> 00:06:17,676
...will be a fresh perspective
on the subject...

29
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:21,303
...and to address any questions
that any of you might have.

30
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:24,007
Now, let's give them
a warm welcome.

31
00:06:27,455 --> 00:06:29,013
-Thank you.
-l'm out of here.

32
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,853
-Why don't we begin with a question.
-This prick can kiss my ass.

33
00:06:41,836 --> 00:06:43,667
As l was saying...

34
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:46,432
...why don't we begin
with a question.

35
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:50,634
-What is a sex crime?
-Not getting any.

36
00:06:59,086 --> 00:07:01,452
What's with that?
She's the one who walked out.

37
00:07:01,922 --> 00:07:05,380
-Suzie Toller.
-l busted her last year for possession.

38
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:07,527
Poor kid did six months
in Camp Nine.

39
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:10,755
-Six months? First offense?
-l didn't hand down the sentence.

40
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:12,626
She was dirty.
l busted her.

41
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,028
Hey, Carol.

42
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,499
l appreciate you guys
taking the time to come.

43
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,898
Our pleasure.

44
00:07:23,344 --> 00:07:26,507
Why do l get the feeling you don't
like the guidance counselor?

45
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,116
Don't tell me you can't see through
his routine. He's a total hound.

46
00:07:30,284 --> 00:07:32,377
You mean pussy hound?

47
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:37,755
Actually, l thought
he was kind of cute.

48
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:39,482
l'd do him.

49
00:08:09,456 --> 00:08:11,185
Steady.

50
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,160
Steady the bow, Jimmy.

51
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:21,529
That's good.

52
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,007
Drop the main.

53
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:35,445
All right, guys, let's de-rig
and l'll see you all Monday.

54
00:08:43,257 --> 00:08:45,725
Hey, ladies, my car needs a wash.

55
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,493
Do you do windows?

56
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:50,459
Good work, guys.
A.C., see you Monday.

57
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:52,895
-See you, Mr. Lombardo.
-All right, buddy.

58
00:09:04,211 --> 00:09:05,644
All right.

59
00:09:05,813 --> 00:09:07,906
l could definitely party
on one of those.

60
00:09:10,951 --> 00:09:12,851
lt's a stinkpot, Jimmy.

61
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,081
You wanna be a real boatman,
you wanna get yourself one of those.

62
00:09:19,093 --> 00:09:20,754
Yeah.

63
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,828
That's a real boat.

64
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,793
Thank you for getting me
into this class.

65
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:29,595
No way my old man was gonna
spring for the fees.

66
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:33,797
Hey, you're working for it, and you're
learning your way around a boat.

67
00:09:33,974 --> 00:09:36,272
l put myself through college
working on boats.

68
00:09:36,443 --> 00:09:38,536
-Beats flipping burgers.
-Yeah.

69
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:43,647
Can l play too, or is it just for boys?

70
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,389
So who's washing your Jeep
this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?

71
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,659
The senior car wash, remember?

72
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:56,519
Washing that old Jeep of mine
is a waste of time.

73
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:59,131
Not at all.
How about if Nicole and l do it?

74
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,097
We're working as a team.

75
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:04,669
l tell you what. l'm going out
to the glades Saturday.

76
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:07,807
Why don't you come over Sunday
and wash all the mud off.

77
00:10:07,975 --> 00:10:09,567
Deal.

78
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:13,509
l was counting on my mom
to give me a ride, but she's not here.

79
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,148
Surprise, surprise.

80
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:18,080
So l was wondering
if you could give me one.

81
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,151
Mr. Lombardo, you really wouldn't
want me to walk, would you?

82
00:10:23,324 --> 00:10:25,724
l mean, like,
something bad might happen.

83
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:31,896
-What about you, you need a lift?
-Yeah, but l got my bike.

84
00:10:32,066 --> 00:10:34,034
Hey, no problem.

85
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:47,479
Okay, try it.

86
00:10:52,286 --> 00:10:55,778
Suzie, you need a lift?
We got room for one more.

87
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:59,949
Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes,
''Whores 4 Less''?

88
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:04,661
Try it again.

89
00:11:10,304 --> 00:11:12,966
Nice to see you kids getting along.

90
00:11:55,115 --> 00:11:58,346
-Don't forget Sunday.
-l won't.

91
00:12:01,355 --> 00:12:04,518
-ls that Sam Lombardo?
-Hi, Mom.

92
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,656
Sam, hi.

93
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:09,255
Hi, Sandra.

94
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:14,766
Why don't you come on in
and have a drink.

95
00:12:14,935 --> 00:12:16,425
Sorry, Sandra, l gotta run.

96
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:34,613
-Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
-Hi, Mr. Lombardo.

97
00:13:35,816 --> 00:13:37,750
Hi, girls.

98
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,118
Look. He forgot.

99
00:13:40,287 --> 00:13:42,448
-l knew it.
-No, l didn't.

100
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:45,615
Check out my Jeep.
Nice and dirty for you.

101
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,759
But you might wanna wait
till the other car leaves.

102
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,092
You mean the Mercedes
isn't yours too?

103
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:56,566
My Benz is blue.
You know that, Nicole.

104
00:13:56,737 --> 00:13:58,329
Sam, l'm leaving.

105
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:01,065
So where's your hose,
Mr. Lombardo?

106
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:06,135
The hose, Kelly,
is right in front of the Jeep.

107
00:14:11,018 --> 00:14:13,816
Kelly Van Ryan's
gonna wash your Jeep?

108
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,712
Come on, Barbara.
lt's for a good cause.

109
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,591
Sam the philanthropist.

110
00:14:21,762 --> 00:14:25,459
Yeah, well, you know what they say:
A little hard work never hurt anyone.

111
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:27,361
Okay.

112
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,936
-Have fun at the club.
-Okay.

113
00:15:32,599 --> 00:15:34,123
Wow.

114
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,202
Looks brand-new.

115
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,065
Aren't you forgetting something?

116
00:15:42,943 --> 00:15:45,673
Your coupon.
We gotta have it.

117
00:15:45,846 --> 00:15:47,643
Oh, yeah, that thing.

118
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:51,849
-Can't we just--?
-Rules are rules, Mr. Lombardo.

119
00:15:52,686 --> 00:15:54,313
Okay, let me look for it.

120
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:57,753
Mr. Lombardo,
we're running kind of late.

121
00:15:58,025 --> 00:16:00,186
How about if Nicole goes on
to the Mansons'?

122
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,260
You can give me a ride
when you find it.

123
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:06,761
No, no, just give me a minute. Okay?

124
00:16:12,506 --> 00:16:15,566
-Go.
-Are you sure?

125
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:31,275
Oh, Frankie.
Oh, God.

126
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:35,683
Oh, God!
Oh, God!

127
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:39,124
Goddamn it!

128
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:42,724
-Hello, this is Blue Bay High School.
-Hello.

129
00:17:42,896 --> 00:17:45,228
Your son or daughter
was absent today, Monday--

130
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:47,491
Jesus H. Christ!

131
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:51,437
-What?
-Oh, nothing.

132
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:52,833
Come on.

133
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:59,134
-Art, this is a hell of a fish you caught.
-lt's a barracuda.

134
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,912
lf you weren't so busy
chasing booty...

135
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:05,176
...you'd have come with me
and caught one for yourself.

136
00:18:05,352 --> 00:18:07,752
Don't tell me you're gonna
eat this thing.

137
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:09,183
Why not?

138
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:11,950
lt's a barracuda. lt's poisonous.
lt'll kill you.

139
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:15,652
Shit, man, l could say that
about most of the girls you date.

140
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:17,956
Sandra Van Ryan for Sam.

141
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:28,634
-Sandra, what's up?
-Kelly skipped school today, Sam.

142
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:31,334
Have you heard anything?

143
00:18:31,778 --> 00:18:33,006
Not a word.

144
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:36,206
Never mind.

145
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:38,813
l found her.

146
00:18:41,655 --> 00:18:43,384
Pull!

147
00:18:43,824 --> 00:18:47,692
Listen, Sam, it was really good
seeing you the other day.

148
00:18:48,295 --> 00:18:50,229
Sandra, l'm real busy right now, so--

149
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:55,332
l haven't found anyone who can
handle my boat the way you can.

150
00:18:57,504 --> 00:19:00,234
-Yeah, well--
-l know you're fucking Barbara Baxter.

151
00:19:00,574 --> 00:19:05,136
-So what?
-So maybe l'm a one-woman man now.

152
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:08,841
Aw, poor Sam.

153
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:12,348
Really think you'll get one of these
Blue Bay women to marry you?

154
00:19:12,686 --> 00:19:15,814
-Are you finished, Sandra?
-Grab a clue, honey.

155
00:19:15,989 --> 00:19:19,152
You're a hired hand, a good lay.
That's as far as it goes.

156
00:19:19,326 --> 00:19:21,590
Enjoy it, while it lasts.

157
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:23,695
Goodbye, Sandra.

158
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:27,065
Pull!

159
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,700
You seem to find guns therapeutic.

160
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,965
Maybe l ought to try it.

161
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,577
So let me guess.

162
00:19:39,746 --> 00:19:42,579
Some boy didn't call and screwed up
your whole weekend.

163
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,946
So you're taking the day off. Right?

164
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,754
Which one of your deck hands
is that?

165
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,189
Whichever one l want.

166
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:00,355
Okay, Kelly, what's the matter?

167
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,327
What is it?

168
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,831
l miss Dad.

169
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:11,406
Jesus.

170
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:16,645
l miss him too, sometimes.

171
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,111
No, you don't.

172
00:20:18,285 --> 00:20:20,981
He didn't have to kill himself, Kelly.

173
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,224
Oh, Kelly....

174
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:35,399
l don't know why he did it.

175
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,464
l really don't.

176
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,205
Can l--?

177
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:52,649
Can l get you anything?

178
00:20:53,386 --> 00:20:54,944
Do you want a Valium?

179
00:20:59,092 --> 00:21:01,424
l was raped.

180
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:07,063
-What, honey? l can't hear you.
-l said, l was raped.

181
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,928
What?

182
00:21:12,072 --> 00:21:14,233
l was raped...

183
00:21:15,542 --> 00:21:18,067
...by Sam Lombardo.

184
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,980
Sam Lombardo?

185
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:27,017
My daughter does not
get raped in Blue Bay!

186
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,845
And you're saying that
Sam Lombardo raped her?

187
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:33,857
That son of a bitch must be insane
to think he can do this to me.

188
00:21:34,995 --> 00:21:37,429
We understand your feelings,
Miss Van Ryan...

189
00:21:37,597 --> 00:21:40,657
...but please,
we need some time with Kelly.

190
00:21:40,934 --> 00:21:42,993
We'd like to take her statement alone.

191
00:21:47,173 --> 00:21:49,664
-Are you all right with this, baby?
-Yeah.

192
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:51,333
Okay.

193
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04,114
Would you like to take a break
for a minute?

194
00:22:05,425 --> 00:22:06,949
l just wanna get it over with.

195
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,853
We'd like to videotape this statement.

196
00:22:11,031 --> 00:22:14,467
l know this isn't pleasant, Kelly,
but these are serious charges...

197
00:22:14,634 --> 00:22:19,162
...and we need to know everything that
happened between the two of you.

198
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:21,133
Are you ready?

199
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:33,876
He started rubbing my shoulders.

200
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,022
I let him.

201
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,716
I mean, he's a nice guy.

202
00:22:42,228 --> 00:22:44,093
The next thing...

203
00:22:44,898 --> 00:22:48,197
...his hand was in my shorts.

204
00:22:49,536 --> 00:22:51,470
You know, from behind.

205
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,609
His fingers....

206
00:22:58,478 --> 00:23:01,743
-His fingers....
-Take your time.

207
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:07,419
They were in me.

208
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:09,484
Both places, you know?

209
00:23:11,491 --> 00:23:14,119
Did he put himself inside you?

210
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,853
Yes.

211
00:23:17,564 --> 00:23:19,691
I said ''Stop. ''
I screamed.

212
00:23:19,866 --> 00:23:22,892
I mean, that's how it
sounded in my head.

213
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,299
He hurt me.

214
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,964
Did you try to fight him?

215
00:23:31,644 --> 00:23:34,477
Well, he had my wrists
pinned behind me.

216
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:36,046
Then what?

217
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:39,447
He kept saying, ''Let it happen.

218
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,719
Let it happen. ''

219
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:45,720
And then he just stopped.

220
00:23:46,025 --> 00:23:48,084
You mean he withdrew?

221
00:23:48,261 --> 00:23:51,628
I don't know. It's really hard
to remember, exactly.

222
00:23:52,365 --> 00:23:53,992
Try, Kelly.

223
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,397
I know one thing he said.

224
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:06,570
He said, ''Don't worry.
I didn't come. ''

225
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,038
I can't forget that.

226
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:14,614
He said, ''No little girl
can ever make me come. ''

227
00:24:18,391 --> 00:24:21,918
''No little girl can ever
make me come.'' Jesus.

228
00:24:22,095 --> 00:24:25,155
Too bad. We might have had
some physical evidence.

229
00:24:27,433 --> 00:24:28,661
What?

230
00:24:28,835 --> 00:24:32,669
Maybe there's no physical evidence
because nothing happened.

231
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:37,435
You want my gut? There it is.
l think she's acting.

232
00:24:37,610 --> 00:24:40,943
l think she set it up to be alone
with him so he'd come on to her.

233
00:24:41,114 --> 00:24:42,775
She's upset because he didn't.

234
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:45,645
Maybe she set it up that way.
Maybe not.

235
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,685
The guy never should've had her
there in the first place.

236
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:51,915
The line l have on him,
he's done half the women in Blue Bay.

237
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:54,321
That doesn't make him a rapist.

238
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:56,787
What about asking her
to take a polygraph?

239
00:24:56,963 --> 00:24:59,295
What about asking the pope
to take a piss test?

240
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,898
This is Blue Bay, Gloria.

241
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:05,766
Ask a Van Ryan to take a lie detector
test and Tom Baxter will cut you down.

242
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:09,136
You afraid of Tom Baxter now?
You afraid of Sandra Van Ryan?

243
00:25:09,309 --> 00:25:12,403
End of discussion.
You both know what to do.

244
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:15,742
Start with his neighbors, coworkers.
Talk to Kelly's friends.

245
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:18,679
-You know what that'll mean for him.
-Yeah.

246
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:24,050
And you heard Kelly's statement.
The guy's dirty. Bring me a case.

247
00:26:16,676 --> 00:26:18,007
All right.

248
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:20,042
Good work, Jimbo.
l'll see you Monday.

249
00:26:20,213 --> 00:26:21,544
All right.

250
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:31,049
That's what's left of my sailing class.

251
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,391
Talk to me, Artie.

252
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:40,727
Kelly Van Ryan
is accusing you of rape.

253
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:43,530
Jimmy told me.

254
00:26:44,037 --> 00:26:46,335
Apparently, l'm the last one
to know about it.

255
00:26:46,506 --> 00:26:48,474
Sam, l....

256
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,775
Sandra Van Ryan has been
on the horn all day...

257
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,037
...with every member
of the school board.

258
00:26:54,213 --> 00:26:55,680
She's pushing for suspension.

259
00:26:55,848 --> 00:26:59,682
And the board's just gonna roll over
for her without hearing my side?

260
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:03,652
This is insane.
l'm innocent, goddamn it.

261
00:27:03,823 --> 00:27:05,290
You gotta believe that.

262
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:07,688
All l can tell you, Sam,
is hang in there.

263
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,851
They clear you, you get reinstated--

264
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:12,691
You never get clear
of something like this.

265
00:27:14,334 --> 00:27:15,824
lt stays with you.

266
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:19,438
lt follows you around forever.

267
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,403
You're gonna need some help, Sam.

268
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:25,536
You're gonna need an attorney.

269
00:27:25,712 --> 00:27:29,079
Right. And maybe you can tell me
which attorney in South Florida...

270
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,240
...is gonna wanna go up against
the Van Ryans in court.

271
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:52,729
l'm here to see Ken Bowden.

272
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:56,966
-Do you have an appointment?
-Oh, yeah. Sam Lombardo.

273
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,236
Okay, then.

274
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:01,970
Mr. Bowden,
your 1 0:30's here.

275
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:04,116
Will you show him in, please?

276
00:28:07,086 --> 00:28:08,986
What brings you
to this part of town?

277
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:12,083
Well, l was, until yesterday...

278
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,250
...a guidance counselor
at Blue Bay High School.

279
00:28:17,163 --> 00:28:19,188
A student there
is accusing me of rape.

280
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,231
Male or female?

281
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:26,433
-The student is Kelly Van Ryan.
-As in Sandra Van Ryan?

282
00:28:26,606 --> 00:28:29,074
As in, l'm fucked.

283
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,269
Why don't you tell me about it?

284
00:28:35,381 --> 00:28:37,508
-Shit, where do l begin?
-Start with...

285
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:41,681
...your relationship with the girl, Kelly.

286
00:28:42,755 --> 00:28:47,158
She's a student. l was her counselor.
Beyond that, there's no relationship.

287
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,785
You got nothing to worry about.

288
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,101
-What did you do to your neck?
-This?

289
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,897
l don't have to wear it all the time.

290
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:05,606
There was an insurance guy
around here earlier.

291
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:10,783
All right, let me tell you
how l charge.

292
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:20,926
Georgie, hey.
We gonna catch some wind?

293
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:23,755
Mr. Lombardo, l'm afraid
l can't park your car today.

294
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:27,491
You can't park me?
l'm meeting Barbara for lunch.

295
00:29:32,905 --> 00:29:35,965
Can you get this parked, Georgie?
We're running late.

296
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:38,133
Right away, Mr. Baxter.

297
00:29:39,312 --> 00:29:43,078
You're finished here, Lombardo.
Take a hike.

298
00:29:48,321 --> 00:29:51,119
Barbara, let's go.

299
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:57,822
Maybe you didn't hear me, Lombardo.

300
00:29:57,997 --> 00:30:00,522
You're finished in Blue Bay.

301
00:30:01,734 --> 00:30:06,330
l find you around my daughter again,
you'll be finished, period.

302
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:10,905
-Get the fuck out of here.
-Mr. Lombardo, please.

303
00:30:16,148 --> 00:30:17,979
That's all right, George.

304
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:44,934
Sam, honey.
Haven't seen you in a while.

305
00:30:45,111 --> 00:30:48,342
-Welcome back.
-Rum and Coke.

306
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,865
Hey! Are you all right?

307
00:32:21,374 --> 00:32:23,433
-l'm fine.
-Cool?

308
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:25,770
That's too bad, motherfucker.

309
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,989
Sam?

310
00:32:46,165 --> 00:32:48,030
Lombardo?

311
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:11,956
Whoa, man! lt's me.

312
00:33:13,359 --> 00:33:16,658
Sorry, man. Things have been
getting a little weird around here.

313
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,729
l can see that.

314
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,166
Come on in.

315
00:33:25,171 --> 00:33:29,369
You're sure this Frankie Condo guy
is the guy that did this to you?

316
00:33:30,276 --> 00:33:31,641
lt was him, all right.

317
00:33:31,811 --> 00:33:34,371
He was driving
Sandra's Range Rover.

318
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:38,005
You tell that to the cops, we can
go after Sandra Van Ryan right now.

319
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:41,415
-Forget it.
-The lady has deep pockets.

320
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:44,317
Believe me, l know how deep
her pockets are.

321
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:48,927
l thought l might be able to save
my house. Some sort of equity loan.

322
00:33:49,295 --> 00:33:52,822
Guess who's on the
board of directors at the bank?

323
00:33:53,232 --> 00:33:56,167
l don't need any more trouble
from this woman.

324
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:59,463
You think making some sort
of statement's gonna stop her?

325
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:02,774
With the shit l got on Kelly?
Yeah.

326
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,399
A year ago...

327
00:34:05,578 --> 00:34:08,240
...when her old man
blew his brains out...

328
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,644
...Kelly lost it, ran away.

329
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:15,014
They found her in a fleabag motel
some place, coked out of her gourd.

330
00:34:15,988 --> 00:34:17,751
Meanwhile...

331
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:21,324
...you, Sam, are voted
Educator of the Year...

332
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:22,756
...or some crap.

333
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:25,597
They put the two of you
in front of a jury...

334
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:28,934
...they're gonna look stupid.
They know it.

335
00:34:29,101 --> 00:34:31,865
Why do you think they haven't
taken your statement yet?

336
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:34,663
Because they're busy
looking for dirt.

337
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,603
And they're not gonna find it.

338
00:34:40,012 --> 00:34:41,877
Right?

339
00:34:43,182 --> 00:34:46,345
Ken, l don't fuck my students.

340
00:35:22,154 --> 00:35:24,679
He's just showing off
for you now.

341
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:28,986
Hey there, Ruby.

342
00:35:29,228 --> 00:35:31,458
l see you still got Walter.

343
00:35:32,031 --> 00:35:34,397
l was hoping something
had eaten him by now.

344
00:35:36,669 --> 00:35:39,729
-Can l help you with something?
-Suzie called us.

345
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:41,964
Where would we find her?

346
00:35:43,209 --> 00:35:45,109
You know the way.

347
00:35:51,483 --> 00:35:54,247
You won't shoot her, will you?

348
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,251
l don't believe she's armed.

349
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,726
Yeah?

350
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:43,196
Jesus, it took you guys
long enough.

351
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:48,170
What if someone was trying to
strangle me or fuck me in the ass?

352
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:52,400
l mean,
you guys do sex crimes, right?

353
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:55,545
My partner, Detective Perez.

354
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:05,853
lt's C¨¦line. He's okay. He had a good
line on what cheap fucks people are.

355
00:37:06,025 --> 00:37:08,789
Yeah, so Suzie, you called us.
Remember?

356
00:37:16,835 --> 00:37:19,326
Did they arrest Mr. Lombardo?

357
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:22,601
No.

358
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:26,601
-Will they?
-l don't know.

359
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,645
That bothers you?

360
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,018
l wanna go outside.

361
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:44,154
When was this that Sam Lombardo
gave you the ride?

362
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,321
About a year ago.

363
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,661
And when you arrived at your trailer,
was anyone there?

364
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:52,429
-Nope.
-So you were alone.

365
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:54,265
Yeah.

366
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,271
Did he come in with you?

367
00:37:56,442 --> 00:38:01,038
-l guess.
-You guess. Well, did he or didn't he?

368
00:38:01,213 --> 00:38:04,148
Okay. Yeah, he did.

369
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:05,908
And then what? Did he touch you?

370
00:38:06,085 --> 00:38:09,020
Did you maybe flirt with him a little?

371
00:38:09,688 --> 00:38:12,589
Suzie, look, l know you feel bad.

372
00:38:13,125 --> 00:38:17,186
-Just tell us the truth.
-l didn't say a thing to him.

373
00:38:18,163 --> 00:38:22,031
He just put his arm around me
and told me l was pretty.

374
00:38:22,835 --> 00:38:25,326
l could be really pretty, he said.

375
00:38:26,038 --> 00:38:27,733
Did you ask him to stop?

376
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:30,431
Shit.

377
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,674
What difference does it make?
No one believes me anyway.

378
00:38:33,846 --> 00:38:37,077
-Did Sam Lombardo rape you?
-Yeah. Okay? He did.

379
00:38:37,249 --> 00:38:39,547
He pushed me to the floor
and he did it to me.

380
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:44,584
-Now are we done?
-Almost, Suzie.

381
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,520
Almost.

382
00:38:47,593 --> 00:38:50,221
At some point,
were you able to fight him off?

383
00:38:51,263 --> 00:38:54,755
No. He stopped by himself.

384
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,427
Okay? ls that it?
Leave me alone.

385
00:38:58,971 --> 00:39:02,407
-Don't touch me!
-All right, take it easy. Take it easy.

386
00:39:02,574 --> 00:39:04,371
He stopped.

387
00:39:04,543 --> 00:39:07,774
And that was it? He just left?

388
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:10,145
Yeah.

389
00:39:11,683 --> 00:39:13,981
He did say one thing first.

390
00:39:14,253 --> 00:39:15,720
What was that?

391
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:20,482
He said, ''No little bitch
can ever make me come.''

392
00:39:23,495 --> 00:39:25,326
Open the gate.

393
00:39:30,769 --> 00:39:34,136
-Hey, counselor, how about a smoke?
-Hello, Jinxy.

394
00:39:37,409 --> 00:39:40,674
You know, it's really a
bad news, good news situation.

395
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:45,549
You were denied bail,
but you got a real attorney...

396
00:39:45,717 --> 00:39:47,742
...instead of a public defender.

397
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:51,154
l'm telling you, Ken, l'm innocent.

398
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:55,824
You are preaching to the choir.
You're not alone.

399
00:40:02,935 --> 00:40:05,335
So you're the new
chicken licker.

400
00:40:14,513 --> 00:40:16,208
Sandra, can we get your comment?

401
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:18,508
Can l just have your feelings
at this time?

402
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:21,152
Mr. Lombardo will get
what he deserves.

403
00:40:21,854 --> 00:40:23,446
Can you tell us anything?

404
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,954
-Are you confident about the case?
-Very. Yes.

405
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:28,992
The Lombardo rape case
has galvanized the upscale town...

406
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:31,152
...of Blue Bay with its tabloid appeal.

407
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:33,230
Now just arriving, Sandra Van Ryan...

408
00:40:33,398 --> 00:40:37,266
...jet-set real estate heiress
and part of the powerful Blue Bay elite.

409
00:40:37,436 --> 00:40:41,099
And the girl from the wrong side of the
tracks. ln the end, the jury...

410
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:44,140
...must choose between the words
of these 1 8-year-old girls...

411
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:45,901
...and that of Sam Lombardo.

412
00:40:46,078 --> 00:40:48,740
Reporting from the courthouse steps,
l'm Nancy Duerr.

413
00:40:48,914 --> 00:40:50,575
Eyewitness News.

414
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:32,789
The State of Florida
v. Sam Lombardo.

415
00:41:32,958 --> 00:41:36,860
The Honorable Sylvia B. Waxman
presiding. All rise.

416
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:39,062
We gotta stand up.

417
00:41:42,734 --> 00:41:44,224
Please be seated.

418
00:41:44,403 --> 00:41:46,064
Now sit down.

419
00:42:00,052 --> 00:42:01,883
Would you like more time, Kelly?

420
00:42:07,459 --> 00:42:10,587
l know that this is hard, Kelly...

421
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:13,765
...but l have one more question.

422
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:16,799
And even though it's something
we've been over...

423
00:42:16,969 --> 00:42:20,200
...l want us all
to be very clear about it.

424
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:25,142
Kelly , when you saw
that Mr. Lombardo...

425
00:42:25,744 --> 00:42:28,508
...intended to have sex with you...

426
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,807
...what were your exact words?

427
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,283
What did you say?

428
00:42:34,486 --> 00:42:36,920
l told him ''No.''

429
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:40,752
l said,
''Stop, Mr. Lombardo. Please.''

430
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:46,354
l screamed for him to stop.

431
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48,797
You screamed for him...

432
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,365
...to stop.

433
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:54,301
And did he?

434
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,469
No.

435
00:42:58,343 --> 00:43:01,471
He raped me on the floor
of his shitty house.

436
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,620
Thank you.

437
00:43:17,629 --> 00:43:17,796
lt's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

438
00:43:17,796 --> 00:43:21,562
lt's day two of the Lombardo rape case
and the second alleged young victim...

439
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,531
...of the former guidance counselor
has taken the stand.

440
00:43:24,703 --> 00:43:28,503
Yesterday, Kelly Van Ryan delivered
an emotional account of events...

441
00:43:28,674 --> 00:43:32,110
...and was not swayed by
defense counsel's cross-examination.

442
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:35,474
We'll come back live later
with an update of these proceedings.

443
00:43:35,647 --> 00:43:38,445
Reporting from the courthouse
steps, I'm Nancy Duerr...

444
00:43:38,617 --> 00:43:40,517
...Eyewitness News.

445
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:00,865
Good morning, everybody.

446
00:44:03,108 --> 00:44:04,541
Ms. Toller.

447
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:08,002
When you were...

448
00:44:08,180 --> 00:44:11,809
...picked up for shoplifting
your freshman year at Blue Bay...

449
00:44:11,983 --> 00:44:15,043
...and you were allowed
to make one call...

450
00:44:15,220 --> 00:44:18,383
...you called Mr. Lombardo.
lsn't that correct?

451
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,453
Ms. Toller?

452
00:44:22,127 --> 00:44:24,357
-Yes.
-And when you were expelled...

453
00:44:24,529 --> 00:44:26,895
...for destruction
of school property--

454
00:44:27,065 --> 00:44:30,296
l broke a fucking window.
And it wasn't even my fault.

455
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:35,062
Ms. Toller, you will wait until
you are asked before responding...

456
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:38,539
...and you will refrain from
using profanity in this court.

457
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:46,344
lt was Mr. Lombardo who appeared
with you in lieu of a parent conference.

458
00:44:46,518 --> 00:44:48,008
ls that right?

459
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:49,551
Yes.

460
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:52,956
lt seems to me...

461
00:44:53,125 --> 00:44:56,458
...that Mr. Lombardo
was your friend.

462
00:44:56,628 --> 00:44:58,323
He was.

463
00:44:59,498 --> 00:45:02,467
But all that changed when...

464
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:06,100
...according to your testimony...

465
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,099
...Mr. Lombardo...

466
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:11,003
...raped you...

467
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,343
...on April 23 of last year,
is that right?

468
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:19,277
-Yes.
-But then in May...

469
00:45:19,918 --> 00:45:23,445
...when you were arrested
for possession of narcotics...

470
00:45:23,622 --> 00:45:26,113
...and again allowed a phone call...

471
00:45:27,726 --> 00:45:29,250
...you called Mr. Lombardo.

472
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:37,665
-So what?
-So what?

473
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:42,267
So what?

474
00:45:45,043 --> 00:45:46,806
Oops, Suzie.

475
00:45:47,946 --> 00:45:52,713
So one month after you say this man
raped you, you go to him for help?

476
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,483
Sounds as if you still considered
Mr. Lombardo a good friend.

477
00:45:58,657 --> 00:46:01,217
-l needed help.
-l'm sure you did.

478
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:03,551
But Mr. Lombardo
wasn't there this time.

479
00:46:03,728 --> 00:46:05,457
lt was summer, he was gone...

480
00:46:06,064 --> 00:46:10,228
...and you spent six months
in a state correctional facility.

481
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:12,795
Did that make you mad, Suzie...

482
00:46:12,971 --> 00:46:16,668
...that Sam was gone?
That he wasn't there?

483
00:46:18,210 --> 00:46:21,577
ls that why you're saying
these things about Mr. Lombardo...

484
00:46:21,746 --> 00:46:24,340
-...your friend?
-l said them because they happened.

485
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:27,314
Ms. Toller, are you gonna
sit there today, under oath...

486
00:46:27,486 --> 00:46:29,852
...and swear that Samuel Lombardo
raped you?

487
00:46:30,021 --> 00:46:32,046
l said he did.

488
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:34,881
Let me ask you a question,
Ms. Toller.

489
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:38,689
Did you enjoy
being a guest of the state?

490
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:41,859
Because l promise you,
if you are lying about this...

491
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:43,660
...and l believe you are...

492
00:46:43,835 --> 00:46:47,293
...that you will be visiting
that facility again quite soon.

493
00:46:47,572 --> 00:46:51,633
Which is why l'm gonna ask you
again now, under oath.

494
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,471
Suzie...

495
00:46:54,713 --> 00:46:56,908
...did Samuel Lombardo rape you?

496
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:04,987
Ms. Toller, you will have to
answer the question.

497
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,187
-Ms. Toller.
-Goddamn it!

498
00:47:13,732 --> 00:47:16,030
-This was not my idea.
-Objection, Your Honor.

499
00:47:16,368 --> 00:47:19,860
Ms. Toller is clearly responding
to defense counsel's badgering.

500
00:47:20,038 --> 00:47:23,235
Court would like to hear
what Ms. Toller has to say.

501
00:47:23,475 --> 00:47:25,500
Ms. Toller?

502
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,880
Sam Lombardo didn't rape me.

503
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,645
He didn't rape Kelly either.
He didn't do anything.

504
00:47:34,819 --> 00:47:39,256
This is ridiculous. The witness has
been threatened by defense counsel!

505
00:47:39,424 --> 00:47:42,951
l think l made it plain this court
intends to hear Ms. Toller's story.

506
00:47:44,829 --> 00:47:46,626
Ms. Toller.

507
00:47:47,799 --> 00:47:50,597
l just wanted to hurt
Mr. Lombardo.

508
00:47:51,303 --> 00:47:54,329
He was my friend at first.

509
00:47:54,506 --> 00:47:57,566
And then l got busted,
and he didn't stick up for me...

510
00:47:57,742 --> 00:48:00,142
...and l had to go away
to that hell hole.

511
00:48:00,312 --> 00:48:02,906
lt's like you're his favorite,
and then ''Who cares?''

512
00:48:03,081 --> 00:48:04,514
Make her stop.

513
00:48:04,683 --> 00:48:07,117
When Kelly said that
we should do this...

514
00:48:07,285 --> 00:48:09,150
-...l thought, ''Cool.''
-Kelly!

515
00:48:09,321 --> 00:48:12,620
All these big shots screwing me over,
like that cop, Duquette.

516
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:15,988
-Now they're gonna get screwed.
-l'm sorry, Your Honor.

517
00:48:16,161 --> 00:48:17,458
l have to object.

518
00:48:17,629 --> 00:48:20,393
Your Honor, please, may l be heard?

519
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:24,433
Mr. Baxter, you are not
trying this case.

520
00:48:24,603 --> 00:48:25,865
Go sit down.

521
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:33,608
Kelly's pissed
at Mr. Lombardo too.

522
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:36,642
She's in love with him.

523
00:48:36,815 --> 00:48:39,079
He's been her fantasy
since her old man died.

524
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,117
Then she found out he was doing
her mom, and that was it.

525
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:44,187
What? Kelly!

526
00:48:44,356 --> 00:48:46,517
You skanky bitch!

527
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:50,619
Get your fucking hands off of me!
Don't you know who l am?

528
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:53,923
-l'm gonna have you fired on Monday!
-Right this way.

529
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:01,300
Just get the hell away from me.

530
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,542
Jesus, man! Let loose!

531
00:49:06,811 --> 00:49:09,837
l'm just thinking about where
l'm gonna stay.

532
00:49:10,015 --> 00:49:12,279
l lost my house.

533
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,509
Waking up from
a goddamn nightmare.

534
00:49:14,686 --> 00:49:16,176
You'll get over it.

535
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:19,482
We have got a knockdown,
airtight, motherfucker lawsuit...

536
00:49:19,658 --> 00:49:21,990
...against Sandra Van Ryan.

537
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,991
Just like that?

538
00:49:24,162 --> 00:49:25,424
Just like that?

539
00:49:26,164 --> 00:49:28,223
These people ruined your life, bro.

540
00:49:28,566 --> 00:49:33,003
l told you they were gonna go too far.
They went overboard! They did!

541
00:49:33,171 --> 00:49:37,631
They'll settle. Believe me.
They'll be begging to settle.

542
00:49:38,109 --> 00:49:41,510
Oh, yeah! Here we go!
Hey, wait up! Come on, girl.

543
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:44,945
In a startling turn of events,
Sam Lombardo has been dismissed...

544
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:48,677
...following a reversal of testimony
by one of his alleged victims.

545
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,887
Excuse me. Over here.

546
00:49:51,056 --> 00:49:52,751
Excuse me. Can anybody read?

547
00:49:53,191 --> 00:49:56,718
Hey! Sandra!

548
00:49:56,928 --> 00:50:00,864
l want you to nail that shyster's balls
to the nearest wall.

549
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:04,001
We could have,
if Ms. Not-So-Bright here...

550
00:50:04,169 --> 00:50:06,228
-...hadn't thrown things.
-Fuck off.

551
00:50:06,404 --> 00:50:11,398
l cannot believe you're just gonna
let them get away with this shit!

552
00:50:11,576 --> 00:50:14,204
All on the word of
one little white-trash bitch.

553
00:50:14,379 --> 00:50:17,348
l don't think you get it, Sandy.

554
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,506
Your princess here
committed perjury.

555
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:23,450
lt'll be all l can do to keep
her fucking little ass out of jail.

556
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:26,681
Well, what are we going to do?

557
00:50:34,265 --> 00:50:37,166
-You're gonna love this place, Tom.
-Thank you.

558
00:50:38,603 --> 00:50:40,764
That jalape¨¾o pork platter
will kill you.

559
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:46,367
l mean, you can't eat sushi every day
of the week.

560
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,944
Bowden, why don't you
cut the crap...

561
00:50:49,114 --> 00:50:52,083
...and tell me
what your client really wants.

562
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:56,954
Okay, Baxter.

563
00:50:57,122 --> 00:51:01,024
My client wants your client
to saddle up...

564
00:51:01,192 --> 00:51:03,752
...so we can ride her ass
straight to the bank.

565
00:51:07,031 --> 00:51:10,000
You know, Ken.

566
00:51:10,268 --> 00:51:11,530
May l call you Ken?

567
00:51:13,605 --> 00:51:16,301
There will be other cases,
other days.

568
00:51:18,877 --> 00:51:21,243
The way l see it...

569
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:23,709
...Tommy...

570
00:51:23,882 --> 00:51:27,215
...is that everybody's gotta
eat some shit sometime.

571
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:30,917
You like yours hot?

572
00:51:31,089 --> 00:51:32,886
Yeah.

573
00:51:40,865 --> 00:51:43,800
-Here's your coffee, Sam.
-Thank you.

574
00:51:57,382 --> 00:51:59,077
Ken.

575
00:52:11,196 --> 00:52:13,460
Sorry l'm late.

576
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,064
Hold my calls, Lenore.

577
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,261
Okay, Mr. Bowden.

578
00:52:39,924 --> 00:52:41,949
Thank you, Sandra.

579
00:52:47,398 --> 00:52:49,298
l'll be seeing you.

580
00:52:49,467 --> 00:52:51,731
-Okay?
-Okay. Yeah.

581
00:52:57,909 --> 00:53:00,139
Nice to see you, Tom.

582
00:53:00,478 --> 00:53:02,070
Come by.
We'll have lunch.

583
00:53:05,617 --> 00:53:07,778
See you at the club.

584
00:53:10,021 --> 00:53:12,046
See you at the club.

585
00:53:12,757 --> 00:53:14,918
See you at the club.

586
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:17,117
See you at the club.

587
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:19,423
See you at the club, Tommy!

588
00:53:19,597 --> 00:53:22,623
Hey, Tom.
What did you shoot today, pal?

589
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,859
Hey, my man!

590
00:53:26,905 --> 00:53:28,998
This is for you.

591
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:31,770
-You did good, Ken.
-Yeah.

592
00:53:31,943 --> 00:53:33,638
Thanks.

593
00:53:34,812 --> 00:53:38,839
l know there's a part of you that wishes
none of this had happened, but it did.

594
00:53:39,017 --> 00:53:41,815
So take the money
and enjoy yourself.

595
00:53:41,986 --> 00:53:45,012
All right? Find a happy place.

596
00:53:45,223 --> 00:53:47,919
Lenore, would you see
Mr. Lombardo out, please?

597
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:51,323
-Goodbye, Sam.
-Bye, Lenore.

598
00:54:09,553 --> 00:54:11,987
Take care of my lizards?

599
00:54:20,331 --> 00:54:21,593
Hello, Kelly.

600
00:54:22,166 --> 00:54:23,758
Drop dead.

601
00:54:23,934 --> 00:54:28,166
You know how my mom's paying you
off? She's breaking my trust.

602
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:32,771
l can't touch it until she's dead,
and now she's breaking it to pay you.

603
00:54:32,943 --> 00:54:34,205
l'm sorry, Kelly.

604
00:54:34,378 --> 00:54:37,370
Why don't you start fucking her
again! You can spend it together!

605
00:54:37,548 --> 00:54:40,210
l hate you! l fucking hate you,
you son of a bitch!

606
00:54:40,751 --> 00:54:42,685
l fucking hate you!

607
00:54:54,899 --> 00:54:58,926
You see, Art? l couldn't come back
even if l wanted to.

608
00:55:36,574 --> 00:55:38,633
Goddamn maid.

609
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,179
So you got my mom's money.

610
00:56:17,882 --> 00:56:19,474
How much?

611
00:56:20,384 --> 00:56:21,874
How much?

612
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:24,884
You know how much.

613
00:56:25,122 --> 00:56:26,953
Your turn to pay.

614
00:56:30,161 --> 00:56:33,494
lt worked! We screwed the bitch!

615
00:56:34,331 --> 00:56:37,027
lt worked just like you said.

616
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:39,827
What's wrong?

617
00:56:40,004 --> 00:56:43,269
You scared the shit out of me.
What's wrong is your coming here.

618
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,069
That's what's wrong.
Are you fucking crazy?

619
00:56:48,145 --> 00:56:51,546
Yeah, l'm crazy. Ask my mom.

620
00:56:54,885 --> 00:56:58,218
So how much is 8.5 million
divided by three?

621
00:56:59,323 --> 00:57:02,486
Oh, great. Yeah, this is a big joke.
Big joke.

622
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,596
Everyone thinks this is really funny.
Do you think this is fucking over?

623
00:57:06,764 --> 00:57:10,291
Let me tell you something.
lt's a long fucking way from over.

624
00:57:11,702 --> 00:57:13,863
l'm serious.

625
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:20,266
After tonight the three of us
are not to be seen together again.

626
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,604
After tonight?

627
00:57:25,549 --> 00:57:27,312
Yeah, well...

628
00:57:27,852 --> 00:57:29,877
...we're here, aren't we?

629
00:57:32,756 --> 00:57:35,384
So maybe one celebration
is okay...

630
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:38,287
...if we're in agreement...

631
00:57:39,230 --> 00:57:41,061
...that from here on out...

632
00:57:43,067 --> 00:57:45,831
...you do exactly as l say.

633
00:58:28,345 --> 00:58:31,837
Guidance counselors get to find out
all sorts of interesting things.

634
00:58:44,561 --> 00:58:47,029
Now l want you two to kiss.

635
00:58:48,666 --> 00:58:50,634
Come on, now.

636
00:58:50,801 --> 00:58:53,895
Never let the sun go down
on an argument.

637
01:00:11,281 --> 01:00:14,648
l told you they were
gonna make us look stupid.

638
01:00:15,252 --> 01:00:19,052
Hey, you're right.
They did make us look stupid.

639
01:00:19,623 --> 01:00:21,614
What you're wrong about is why.

640
01:00:22,359 --> 01:00:23,758
All right, hear me out.

641
01:00:24,228 --> 01:00:27,163
Lombardo was having an affair
with Sandra Van Ryan, right?

642
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:28,628
Why not tell us about it?

643
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,132
That's a hell of a motive
for Kelly to fabricate this story.

644
01:00:32,302 --> 01:00:35,396
Maybe Lombardo's attorney
was saving the affair for the trial.

645
01:00:35,572 --> 01:00:38,905
l thought about it and said: ''You're
Lombardo. Your life is trashed.

646
01:00:39,076 --> 01:00:41,977
You don't wanna sit in jail
for three months unless--''

647
01:00:42,146 --> 01:00:43,875
Unless what?

648
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:49,183
Unless you're setting Sandra
Van Ryan up for the big payday.

649
01:00:49,353 --> 01:00:52,789
Lombardo was eyeball-deep in debt
before this whole thing started...

650
01:00:52,956 --> 01:00:56,892
...trying to keep up with a pricey girl
like Barbara Baxter. That's expensive.

651
01:00:57,061 --> 01:00:59,495
Lombardo may be broke,
but why would Kelly steal?

652
01:00:59,663 --> 01:01:03,565
Kid's got money from her grandfather
she can't touch until her mother dies.

653
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:08,134
l'm telling you,
this guy wanted to marry money.

654
01:01:08,872 --> 01:01:12,399
When that didn't happen,
he went to work on these two girls...

655
01:01:12,576 --> 01:01:14,567
...using them to set up
Sandra Van Ryan.

656
01:01:14,745 --> 01:01:16,975
I'm telling you,
they chumped us, partner.

657
01:01:17,147 --> 01:01:20,116
They chumped us
right from the start.

658
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,436
Nice stroke.

659
01:02:18,142 --> 01:02:20,133
ls there some reason
why you're here?

660
01:02:20,310 --> 01:02:22,574
-Curiosity, l guess.
-About what?

661
01:02:22,746 --> 01:02:25,442
How to improve your breast stroke?

662
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:31,080
No. l want to know how you see things
working out for you, Sam and Suzie.

663
01:02:32,856 --> 01:02:34,118
Excuse me?

664
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:36,623
You three gonna
go to the Caribbean together?

665
01:02:36,793 --> 01:02:38,226
Live happily ever after?

666
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:41,792
You see, the thing about it is that
threesomes rarely work out.

667
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:43,227
You're out of your mind.

668
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,733
lt's hard enough for one person
to keep a secret, let alone three.

669
01:02:46,904 --> 01:02:49,771
Especially when
two of them are in love.

670
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:54,572
You and Sam don't want that pill-head
around now that you have the money.

671
01:02:55,546 --> 01:02:57,013
Am l right?

672
01:02:57,181 --> 01:03:00,514
Sam sell you on the idea right up
front of whacking Suzie? Hey!

673
01:03:02,186 --> 01:03:04,017
That's murder, kid.

674
01:03:04,188 --> 01:03:07,351
Police. God, get a life.

675
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:11,027
You're good, you know that?

676
01:03:12,930 --> 01:03:16,991
But you don't think that little freak
Suzie's gonna hold up, do you?

677
01:03:38,121 --> 01:03:40,316
Hello, Suzie.

678
01:03:41,191 --> 01:03:42,920
You better watch it
with that shit.

679
01:03:43,093 --> 01:03:45,789
You get busted again,
you go back in a two-time loser.

680
01:03:45,963 --> 01:03:48,124
Yeah, or wind up dead.

681
01:03:55,405 --> 01:03:57,032
You know...

682
01:03:58,242 --> 01:04:02,372
...l don't think l ever told you
how sorry l was about your friend.

683
01:04:02,679 --> 01:04:04,579
What was his name?

684
01:04:07,818 --> 01:04:11,345
Come on, help me out here, Suzie.
You know his name.

685
01:04:13,957 --> 01:04:18,257
-Davy.
-Yeah. That's right. Davy.

686
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:20,655
l was sorry about
the way that worked out.

687
01:04:20,831 --> 01:04:23,629
-That is cop bullshit.
-What was that? What was that?

688
01:04:23,800 --> 01:04:26,769
l don't have to listen to this.
You can't shove me around.

689
01:04:26,937 --> 01:04:29,132
-l have friends now.
-Hey!

690
01:04:29,306 --> 01:04:32,070
This is Ray, Suzie.
You don't have shit!

691
01:04:32,242 --> 01:04:35,769
You never had shit
and you never will have shit.

692
01:04:40,183 --> 01:04:42,151
Take a look at this.

693
01:04:42,886 --> 01:04:45,354
Go ahead, take it.
lt's not gonna bite you.

694
01:04:45,856 --> 01:04:47,118
Take it!

695
01:04:50,794 --> 01:04:53,957
Your friend Sam
deposited the check.

696
01:04:55,265 --> 01:04:59,326
He transferred the funds to
a numbered offshore account.

697
01:04:59,503 --> 01:05:02,529
Cops don't know the names on it.
Think one of them is yours?

698
01:05:03,507 --> 01:05:07,705
He also put a down payment on island
property and a lease on a sailboat.

699
01:05:07,878 --> 01:05:09,505
You're into sailing, aren't you?

700
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:12,843
l don't know why you're telling me this.
Why are you here?

701
01:05:13,016 --> 01:05:16,076
l'm telling you this because
l know exactly what's going on.

702
01:05:16,987 --> 01:05:20,320
Two's company.
Three's a crowd.

703
01:05:20,490 --> 01:05:22,424
Come on, now.

704
01:05:22,592 --> 01:05:26,187
You don't think Kelly and Sam are
gonna share that money with you.

705
01:05:28,432 --> 01:05:30,423
Leave me alone.

706
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:40,467
You know...

707
01:05:40,644 --> 01:05:43,340
...l'd want a clear head
right now if l were you...

708
01:05:44,147 --> 01:05:48,243
...so l could keep a real close eye
on my new friends.

709
01:05:49,486 --> 01:05:52,455
l'd hate to see you
come to a bad end...

710
01:05:52,856 --> 01:05:54,653
...like Davy.

711
01:06:07,204 --> 01:06:08,432
Oh, shit.

712
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:18,870
You've reached Sam Lombardo.
Wait for the beep, leave a message.

713
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:37,197
l can't believe you called Sam.
What's the matter with you?

714
01:06:37,367 --> 01:06:39,699
l'm scared there's no one to trust.

715
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,202
You can trust me.

716
01:06:48,979 --> 01:06:50,412
Hello?

717
01:06:51,081 --> 01:06:53,641
-Kelly, is Suzie there?
-Yeah.

718
01:06:53,817 --> 01:06:55,785
Christ, l was afraid of that.

719
01:06:55,952 --> 01:06:57,920
She left this insane message.

720
01:06:58,088 --> 01:07:00,556
Between whatever she's
been smoking out there...

721
01:07:00,724 --> 01:07:03,022
...and this fucking cop,
she's gonna blow it.

722
01:07:04,261 --> 01:07:06,024
Calm the bitch down.

723
01:07:06,196 --> 01:07:09,165
Why can't you come? Please?

724
01:07:09,900 --> 01:07:13,461
Sam, l miss you so much.

725
01:07:15,972 --> 01:07:19,965
l miss you too, Kelly,
but l can't right now.

726
01:07:20,143 --> 01:07:22,134
We gotta stick to the plan, okay?

727
01:07:23,213 --> 01:07:25,078
If she can't get a fucking grip....

728
01:07:25,248 --> 01:07:28,308
-Then what?
-You know what.

729
01:07:28,952 --> 01:07:30,681
I'll handle it.

730
01:07:30,854 --> 01:07:34,221
But l need you, Kelly.
l need you to be there for me tonight.

731
01:07:35,459 --> 01:07:37,654
-Okay.
-Good.

732
01:07:37,828 --> 01:07:40,695
That's my girl.
You're the strong one, you know that?

733
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:45,368
Now, put Suzie on the line.
I want you both to hear this.

734
01:07:46,369 --> 01:07:48,064
Suzie.

735
01:07:48,972 --> 01:07:50,633
Sam?

736
01:07:50,807 --> 01:07:52,297
Now, look...

737
01:07:52,476 --> 01:07:55,377
...we gotta stay calm, all of us.

738
01:07:55,545 --> 01:07:58,776
Now, since the settlement,
people think l'm rich...

739
01:07:58,949 --> 01:08:02,316
...so l'm out there spending money,
doing what rich guys do.

740
01:08:02,953 --> 01:08:06,411
This cop, Duquette, he's gonna try
and fuck with you. Don't let him.

741
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:10,720
-Yeah, that's easy for you to say.
-Suzie, don't fall apart.

742
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:13,794
The only people who
can fuck this up is us.

743
01:08:22,672 --> 01:08:24,731
You are gonna fuck me over,
aren't you?

744
01:08:24,908 --> 01:08:26,933
Oh, for chrissake.

745
01:08:27,110 --> 01:08:28,600
You are!

746
01:08:28,778 --> 01:08:33,181
Are you retarded, or just brain-dead
from whiffing fumes out in the swamp?

747
01:08:33,350 --> 01:08:38,083
That's what l am to you, isn't it?
Swamp trash, just like my mom.

748
01:08:39,322 --> 01:08:40,550
Don't!

749
01:08:44,394 --> 01:08:46,760
You stupid cunt!

750
01:09:18,962 --> 01:09:21,328
You are scared, aren't you?

751
01:10:46,049 --> 01:10:49,541
Ray! Jesus Christ!

752
01:10:49,919 --> 01:10:51,910
-Are you crazy?
-Hear her say ''Sam''?

753
01:10:52,222 --> 01:10:55,316
That was Lombardo on the phone.
And you saw the two girls.

754
01:10:55,492 --> 01:10:57,824
The conversation on the tape
is unintelligible.

755
01:10:57,994 --> 01:11:00,588
What we have here is you
on the Van Ryan property...

756
01:11:00,764 --> 01:11:03,597
-...shooting a porn flick!
-l can't believe this.

757
01:11:03,767 --> 01:11:06,702
A month ago, they threw things
at each other in court.

758
01:11:06,870 --> 01:11:09,498
They were acting!
They were all acting!

759
01:11:09,673 --> 01:11:11,504
We bought it, hook, line and sinker.

760
01:11:11,675 --> 01:11:14,610
They're getting away with $8 million
from Sandra Van Ryan.

761
01:11:14,778 --> 01:11:17,474
She might have saved it
if she didn't try to ruin him.

762
01:11:17,647 --> 01:11:20,878
You wouldn't go after a guy
you thought raped your daughter?

763
01:11:21,051 --> 01:11:23,383
She bought the same
goddamn story we did!

764
01:11:23,553 --> 01:11:27,421
Both of you, you're not on a case,
because there is no fucking case!

765
01:11:27,891 --> 01:11:31,088
l've had it with Sandra Van Ryan,
and you keep mucking around...

766
01:11:31,261 --> 01:11:33,752
...and she's gonna sue us
for invasion of privacy.

767
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:36,524
So get out of these people's lives!
Hey! Ray!

768
01:11:37,400 --> 01:11:41,234
-Hey! Am l getting through?
-You think this is just about money?

769
01:11:41,404 --> 01:11:43,531
About us looking stupid?
Question him.

770
01:11:44,641 --> 01:11:48,839
You'll find a manipulative psychopath,
and those girls will wind up dead.

771
01:11:49,012 --> 01:11:50,411
Give him something to do.

772
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:53,242
-Look into the Kennedy assassination.
-l understand.

773
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:55,941
Next time this fucking piece of shit...

774
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:58,144
...drags me down here,
l'm gonna sue you.

775
01:11:58,321 --> 01:12:00,653
You're goddamn lucky
l didn't sue last time.

776
01:12:00,857 --> 01:12:02,916
-l agree.
-Am l free to go?

777
01:12:03,093 --> 01:12:05,288
-Yes.
-Thank you.

778
01:12:07,564 --> 01:12:10,397
-Cocksucker.
-Yeah, what was that?

779
01:12:10,567 --> 01:12:14,264
-You heard me, motherfucker.
-Yeah, you wanna say that to my face?

780
01:12:17,941 --> 01:12:19,636
What are you looking at?

781
01:13:03,686 --> 01:13:07,053
-l guess l kind of lost it out there.
-You could say that.

782
01:13:11,461 --> 01:13:14,555
Were you ever in a situation
where you saw something coming...

783
01:13:14,731 --> 01:13:17,063
...and you didn't do
what you could to stop it?

784
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:19,032
We all have.

785
01:13:19,202 --> 01:13:23,070
l mean something bad that you
saw coming, and then it happened...

786
01:13:23,640 --> 01:13:26,871
...and you--
You didn't do anything, and....

787
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,811
l did that once.

788
01:13:34,818 --> 01:13:36,945
l don't wanna do it again.

789
01:13:55,772 --> 01:13:58,070
l thought we were going to a movie.

790
01:14:00,443 --> 01:14:03,378
l think we just need to get wasted.

791
01:14:04,013 --> 01:14:05,674
Yeah.

792
01:14:23,499 --> 01:14:25,057
Come on.

793
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:34,537
l wanna live at the beach someday.

794
01:14:34,878 --> 01:14:36,573
Oh, shit.

795
01:14:36,746 --> 01:14:39,442
l left the keys.

796
01:14:39,616 --> 01:14:41,174
l'll get them.

797
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:02,335
Kelly?

798
01:15:02,505 --> 01:15:04,132
Suzie.

799
01:15:06,643 --> 01:15:08,406
lt's me.

800
01:15:13,216 --> 01:15:16,185
l was worried about you,
and l decided...

801
01:15:16,352 --> 01:15:20,618
...the three of us should get together
one last time before we split up.

802
01:15:21,224 --> 01:15:24,159
-Are you mad at me?
-No, no.

803
01:15:24,327 --> 01:15:26,761
l probably should've told you
a bit more about...

804
01:15:26,930 --> 01:15:29,228
...the part l intended to play.

805
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,333
But we'll go through it again tonight.

806
01:15:35,605 --> 01:15:39,564
This is a celebration, Suzie,
not a suicide pact.

807
01:15:39,776 --> 01:15:43,678
We're gonna chill out
and just relax...

808
01:15:43,846 --> 01:15:46,371
...have a little champagne...

809
01:15:46,549 --> 01:15:48,346
...watch the stars....

810
01:15:49,452 --> 01:15:50,783
Kelly?

811
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:53,616
You got a blanket in the back
of your mom's Rover?

812
01:15:54,724 --> 01:15:57,716
Why don't you be an angel
and run over and get it for us?

813
01:16:00,330 --> 01:16:01,991
Good girl.

814
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:06,158
Let me tell you about the boat
l picked out for us.

815
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:11,194
You okay?

816
01:17:12,735 --> 01:17:16,034
My mom would kill me
if she knew l took the Rover.

817
01:18:16,532 --> 01:18:17,760
Been four-wheeling?

818
01:18:19,469 --> 01:18:21,937
-Get off my property!
-l'm not on your property.

819
01:18:22,105 --> 01:18:25,302
-lf you don't get out of here--
-You'll call a cop? l am a cop!

820
01:18:25,908 --> 01:18:27,136
Goddamn it!

821
01:18:49,098 --> 01:18:51,259
So you say she didn't
come home last night.

822
01:18:51,434 --> 01:18:55,734
She's been talking about going to L.A.,
but her clothes are all still here.

823
01:18:55,905 --> 01:18:58,965
Walter! You get sick,
it'll serve you right.

824
01:19:01,744 --> 01:19:04,872
Found some teeth in an old trailer
down the road.

825
01:19:05,047 --> 01:19:07,106
He says they'll fit.

826
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:11,246
Suzie hasn't been back to school
since the trial.

827
01:19:11,420 --> 01:19:15,117
Oh, and now they're saying
that she can't graduate.

828
01:19:15,291 --> 01:19:19,352
lt is that Kelly Van Ryan that got her
into this whole mess, and you know it.

829
01:19:19,529 --> 01:19:21,724
Well, we'll look into it for you, Ruby.

830
01:19:21,898 --> 01:19:24,890
We find something,
you'll be the first to know.

831
01:19:26,369 --> 01:19:27,768
Come on.

832
01:19:46,222 --> 01:19:48,622
lt's starting, Gloria.
This is how it begins.

833
01:19:48,791 --> 01:19:51,919
Ray, we don't know anything yet.
She could be anywhere.

834
01:19:52,094 --> 01:19:54,585
l'll drop you off.
Put a call out on Suzie's car.

835
01:19:54,764 --> 01:19:56,391
You got someplace you wanna be?

836
01:19:57,233 --> 01:20:00,464
-You got a date?
-Just check the car out for me.

837
01:20:10,213 --> 01:20:12,545
lt's over here, by that old boat.

838
01:20:13,649 --> 01:20:16,311
So you and Suzie used to
come out here together?

839
01:20:16,485 --> 01:20:18,385
Yeah, sometimes.

840
01:20:18,554 --> 01:20:20,988
A lot of the kids hang out here.

841
01:20:22,592 --> 01:20:25,322
You really think something bad
happened to Suzie?

842
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:28,056
Lombardo ever come out here?

843
01:20:30,333 --> 01:20:32,062
l say something funny?

844
01:20:32,235 --> 01:20:36,433
No, but l mean, just the idea
that Mr. Lombardo would--

845
01:20:36,606 --> 01:20:40,167
Well, the way l heard it,
he was pretty tight with the kids.

846
01:20:40,343 --> 01:20:41,867
You and him were pals, right?

847
01:20:42,044 --> 01:20:45,309
Yeah, but he got me
onto the sailing team.

848
01:20:45,481 --> 01:20:48,450
Told me l could work my way
through college, like he did.

849
01:20:48,618 --> 01:20:52,520
Sam Lombardo went to the University
of Miami on an athletic scholarship.

850
01:20:52,688 --> 01:20:56,647
Boats didn't have a damn thing
to do with it.

851
01:21:47,209 --> 01:21:49,200
Listen, l'm gonna be here a while, kid.

852
01:21:49,378 --> 01:21:52,211
Why don't you go up to the highway
and catch the bus?

853
01:21:58,054 --> 01:21:59,681
Hey, Jimmy.

854
01:22:01,891 --> 01:22:06,328
People aren't always what they
appear to be. Don't forget that.

855
01:22:23,779 --> 01:22:26,077
-This is where they did it.
-Where's the body?

856
01:22:26,248 --> 01:22:28,341
The swamp, most likely.
Guy's a swamp rat.

857
01:22:28,517 --> 01:22:31,008
He knows it won't be found,
but he made a mistake.

858
01:22:31,187 --> 01:22:34,987
She'd been threatening to run away
and l found the car at the bus terminal.

859
01:22:35,157 --> 01:22:36,852
You don't think Sam put it there?

860
01:22:37,026 --> 01:22:40,257
Hold on a second.
Gloria, have the car dusted for prints.

861
01:22:40,429 --> 01:22:43,830
And if Suzie even was murdered,
it was that damn Van Ryan kid.

862
01:22:43,999 --> 01:22:46,194
Little sociopath's the one
who started this.

863
01:22:46,369 --> 01:22:49,429
-How long till we get something?
-We can get blood type now.

864
01:22:49,605 --> 01:22:53,097
Dental records will take longer.
DNA could take weeks.

865
01:22:54,710 --> 01:22:56,701
Poor, dumb Suzie.
Kid never had a chance.

866
01:22:56,879 --> 01:22:59,541
-We don't know that.
-l'm telling you, Kelly's next.

867
01:22:59,715 --> 01:23:03,515
l'm telling you, you get
off this right now.

868
01:23:03,786 --> 01:23:07,950
Don't even fucking let me hear
about you bothering Lombardo.

869
01:23:11,427 --> 01:23:12,917
David!

870
01:23:13,095 --> 01:23:15,461
You get an lD, you call me!

871
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:19,061
Will you do me a favor?

872
01:23:20,269 --> 01:23:21,861
Ray, you heard him.

873
01:23:22,037 --> 01:23:25,006
He told me to stay away.
He didn't say anything about you.

874
01:23:25,174 --> 01:23:27,665
What if l'm right and Hunter's wrong?

875
01:23:27,843 --> 01:23:30,311
Please, you gotta help me out
on this, partner.

876
01:23:30,713 --> 01:23:34,012
And if the teeth aren't Suzie's,
you'll give this up?

877
01:23:35,284 --> 01:23:39,186
lf l'm wrong about those teeth,
you got my word.

878
01:24:22,631 --> 01:24:25,361
-Hello?
-I've been calling you.

879
01:24:25,534 --> 01:24:27,331
-l wanna see you.
-Where are you?

880
01:24:27,503 --> 01:24:30,165
-The stupid guest house.
-Good. Stay there.

881
01:24:30,339 --> 01:24:32,136
Sam, l'm really nervous.

882
01:24:32,641 --> 01:24:34,905
Kelly, relax.

883
01:24:35,211 --> 01:24:37,679
Take one of your mom's
Valiums or something.

884
01:24:37,847 --> 01:24:41,544
ln a week, you get on the plane,
this is over. We're rich.

885
01:24:41,717 --> 01:24:43,844
But what if they find out?

886
01:24:44,153 --> 01:24:46,883
My God, they'd put you
in the electric chair.

887
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:48,489
Look, Kelly...

888
01:24:48,657 --> 01:24:51,558
...stay in the guest house,
skip the graduation parties.

889
01:24:51,994 --> 01:24:54,258
l love you so much.

890
01:24:54,430 --> 01:24:56,398
And I love you too, Kelly.

891
01:24:56,565 --> 01:24:58,533
Be a good girl
and stay where you are.

892
01:25:21,690 --> 01:25:24,181
Peeping in people's windows?

893
01:25:24,860 --> 01:25:26,293
lsn't that against the law?

894
01:25:28,163 --> 01:25:29,926
Suzie Toller's missing.

895
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,628
-Since when?
-She didn't come home last night.

896
01:25:33,969 --> 01:25:36,767
We found her car
at the bus terminal.

897
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:38,734
Ray thinks she was murdered.

898
01:25:39,475 --> 01:25:41,602
Well, l don't know what to tell you.

899
01:25:43,345 --> 01:25:46,212
You could tell me
where you were last night.

900
01:25:46,715 --> 01:25:49,980
l suppose l could,
but l don't really have to, now, do l?

901
01:25:53,088 --> 01:25:54,316
Come here.

902
01:25:55,658 --> 01:25:57,785
l wanna show you something.

903
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:11,097
Looks like goodbye.

904
01:26:11,774 --> 01:26:13,537
Kelly's file.

905
01:26:13,776 --> 01:26:17,542
Read it. You're gonna find an angry,
sexually confused girl...

906
01:26:17,713 --> 01:26:20,238
...who threatened the lives
of at least two people.

907
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,849
What two people?

908
01:26:22,017 --> 01:26:24,212
One of them was her mother.

909
01:26:24,453 --> 01:26:26,444
The other one was...

910
01:26:27,823 --> 01:26:29,347
...a female classmate...

911
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:33,622
...she may have been
sexually involved with.

912
01:26:34,730 --> 01:26:36,254
Suzie?

913
01:26:37,933 --> 01:26:39,901
Now you got the file.

914
01:26:40,402 --> 01:26:41,835
Read it.

915
01:26:42,671 --> 01:26:45,834
l think it'll give you a new
perspective on things.

916
01:26:46,976 --> 01:26:50,343
Why didn't you tell us about this
before the trial?

917
01:26:52,381 --> 01:26:55,179
Because then l had principles.

918
01:26:55,351 --> 01:26:57,182
That meant a lot to me.

919
01:26:59,221 --> 01:27:00,654
Now...

920
01:27:02,124 --> 01:27:04,058
...l don't care.

921
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:20,404
l should probably go now.

922
01:27:23,045 --> 01:27:26,014
Unless you're planning
on holding me for something.

923
01:27:53,475 --> 01:27:56,467
-Duquette. What's happening?
-I'm tired. I'm going home.

924
01:27:56,645 --> 01:27:58,135
-Where's Lombardo?
-He's gone.

925
01:27:58,313 --> 01:28:01,510
Goddamn it, Gloria, the blood type
on the rocks matches Suzie's.

926
01:28:01,684 --> 01:28:03,743
Let me tell you something, Ray:

927
01:28:03,919 --> 01:28:05,944
There's more to this story
than you know.

928
01:28:06,121 --> 01:28:07,679
If Suzie is dead...

929
01:28:07,856 --> 01:28:10,290
...Hunter may be on
the right track about Kelly.

930
01:28:12,494 --> 01:28:14,018
Ray?

931
01:28:15,197 --> 01:28:17,631
Shit, Ray.

932
01:28:26,942 --> 01:28:30,070
-Who is it?
-lt's Detective Duquette.

933
01:28:30,245 --> 01:28:32,110
Open the gate, now.

934
01:29:03,479 --> 01:29:05,640
-Hello, Kelly.
-What are you doing here?

935
01:29:23,932 --> 01:29:27,368
Where's--? Kelly! Kelly!

936
01:29:34,943 --> 01:29:38,709
l just looked away for a second,
just a split second.

937
01:29:39,014 --> 01:29:41,812
And just like that, bingo...

938
01:29:42,151 --> 01:29:44,346
...she put a knee in my groin.

939
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:47,318
l didn't go down,
but it slowed me down...

940
01:29:47,823 --> 01:29:49,552
...just enough.

941
01:29:50,125 --> 01:29:52,150
l couldn't get to her.

942
01:29:52,995 --> 01:29:55,020
She turned on me with the gun.

943
01:29:57,166 --> 01:29:59,327
Fired one shot.

944
01:30:00,335 --> 01:30:01,962
l took the hit in the shoulder.

945
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:07,274
l had no choice.

946
01:30:11,146 --> 01:30:12,477
l had to return fire.

947
01:30:14,216 --> 01:30:17,811
Two rounds, l think,
in the chest.

948
01:30:21,557 --> 01:30:23,821
l went there to protect her.

949
01:30:26,662 --> 01:30:29,222
l went-- l went there to protect her.

950
01:30:29,398 --> 01:30:31,127
Detective Duquette.

951
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:34,827
l spent time in military intelligence,
and we had a saying there:

952
01:30:35,003 --> 01:30:38,268
''Once is happenstance.
Twice is coincidence.

953
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,533
Three times is enemy action.''

954
01:30:40,709 --> 01:30:42,734
This is twice for you, Duquette...

955
01:30:42,911 --> 01:30:46,210
...and l intend to see to it
that there is no third time.

956
01:30:46,682 --> 01:30:50,550
Our investigation finds that this was
a good shooting, but that's irrelevant.

957
01:30:50,719 --> 01:30:53,449
You ignored the advice
of your superiors.

958
01:30:53,622 --> 01:30:56,489
Consequently,
two young women are dead.

959
01:30:57,092 --> 01:31:01,153
You are, as of now, terminated,
with forfeiture of pension and benefits.

960
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:02,991
Chief Goodsall...

961
01:31:03,165 --> 01:31:07,397
...Detective Duquette found
Susan Marie Toller's teeth and blood...

962
01:31:07,569 --> 01:31:10,037
...near the area known as
Stoner Beach.

963
01:31:10,205 --> 01:31:13,436
Miss Toller's blood was also found
in the Van Ryan Range Rover.

964
01:31:13,609 --> 01:31:16,601
This has led this office to conclude...

965
01:31:16,945 --> 01:31:20,403
...that Susan Marie Toller was
murdered by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan.

966
01:31:21,583 --> 01:31:23,915
She--
She didn't.

967
01:31:26,355 --> 01:31:28,050
Mr. Duquette.

968
01:31:28,523 --> 01:31:30,184
Mr. Duquette.

969
01:31:30,626 --> 01:31:34,255
This investigation is concluded.
You're dismissed.

970
01:32:00,622 --> 01:32:02,351
Thank you, Paul.

971
01:32:57,112 --> 01:32:58,340
Howdy, partner.

972
01:33:00,248 --> 01:33:04,116
Jesus, man. l wasn't expecting you
until tomorrow.

973
01:33:07,856 --> 01:33:09,756
Hey, nice girlfriend you got there.

974
01:33:09,925 --> 01:33:12,416
Kelly was only supposed to be framed.

975
01:33:12,594 --> 01:33:14,494
The bitch shot me.

976
01:33:14,663 --> 01:33:18,155
Shit, you're a cop.
Don't they teach you to disarm people?

977
01:33:18,333 --> 01:33:20,824
You know, shoot them
in the leg or something?

978
01:33:21,003 --> 01:33:24,336
Did you become squeamish
about this stuff before or after...

979
01:33:24,506 --> 01:33:27,737
...you bludgeoned little Suzie
to death with a wine bottle?

980
01:33:27,909 --> 01:33:31,367
Kelly wasn't supposed to die, Ray.
lt wasn't part of the plan.

981
01:33:31,546 --> 01:33:36,040
lt couldn't have worked out better.
They're convinced Kelly killed Suzie.

982
01:33:36,218 --> 01:33:38,049
l couldn't talk them out of it.

983
01:33:38,220 --> 01:33:40,211
l'm telling you,
l don't like surprises.

984
01:33:40,422 --> 01:33:44,358
Look at it this way:
Every cloud has a silver lining.

985
01:33:44,526 --> 01:33:46,460
Now there's no loose ends.

986
01:33:46,628 --> 01:33:50,120
Come tomorrow,
you'll never see me again.

987
01:33:50,298 --> 01:33:53,790
Oh, listen, about tomorrow...

988
01:33:54,236 --> 01:33:57,933
...l spoke to the bank and they said
it's gonna take two working days...

989
01:33:59,141 --> 01:34:00,938
...to make the transfer, so....

990
01:34:01,109 --> 01:34:02,633
-Bullshit.
-Oh, yeah.

991
01:34:02,811 --> 01:34:04,506
Call them yourself.

992
01:34:04,913 --> 01:34:09,009
Anyway, what's your hurry?
Kick back for a day or two.

993
01:34:09,184 --> 01:34:13,211
We'll take out the boat.
l just had it outfitted.

994
01:34:13,789 --> 01:34:15,654
l could use a deck hand.

995
01:34:21,096 --> 01:34:23,564
Here's to large bank accounts.

996
01:34:25,967 --> 01:34:29,459
You gotta lighten up, partner.
You're a rich man.

997
01:34:32,774 --> 01:34:35,937
To large accounts
and no loose ends.

998
01:34:36,845 --> 01:34:38,710
And no loose ends.

999
01:34:57,099 --> 01:35:00,000
Hey, Ray, you see that winch?

1000
01:35:01,503 --> 01:35:03,767
Take a couple turns on it.
She's luffing.

1001
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:10,171
-You mean that thing?
-Yeah, Ray.

1002
01:35:10,345 --> 01:35:14,475
We call it a winch.
lt's what we use to tighten the sails.

1003
01:35:14,649 --> 01:35:18,779
-So why don't you start cranking?
-This is supposed to be a vacation.

1004
01:35:18,954 --> 01:35:20,945
Why don't you get a nice powerboat?

1005
01:35:21,623 --> 01:35:24,285
Come on, Ray.
l'll make a sailor out of you yet.

1006
01:35:25,227 --> 01:35:27,058
Or get me drowned.

1007
01:35:41,176 --> 01:35:42,404
lt's stuck.

1008
01:35:42,577 --> 01:35:45,808
What do you mean, it's stuck?
Put a little elbow grease in it.

1009
01:35:50,085 --> 01:35:51,677
lt's stuck, l'm telling you.

1010
01:35:53,555 --> 01:35:55,819
The jenny sheet must be
caught on something.

1011
01:35:55,991 --> 01:35:59,256
Why don't you go starboard
and see if you can unhook it?

1012
01:35:59,427 --> 01:36:02,919
-l don't understand a word you said.
-Okay, Ray.

1013
01:36:03,098 --> 01:36:06,067
You see this line right here?
Follow it down...

1014
01:36:06,234 --> 01:36:08,862
...and see if you can see
what it's snagged on.

1015
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:12,197
You're killing me.

1016
01:36:20,949 --> 01:36:24,908
-You mean this thing?
-That's it. That one right there.

1017
01:36:25,320 --> 01:36:27,311
You see anything?

1018
01:36:30,258 --> 01:36:32,123
Look a little lower.

1019
01:36:32,394 --> 01:36:33,622
That's it.

1020
01:36:42,704 --> 01:36:45,229
Guess l forgot to tell you, Ray:

1021
01:36:46,942 --> 01:36:49,433
One hand for the boat,
the other one for yourself.

1022
01:36:49,844 --> 01:36:51,971
First rule of sailing.

1023
01:37:17,272 --> 01:37:18,534
Ray!

1024
01:37:18,707 --> 01:37:21,335
-What happened?
-Nice try, motherfucker!

1025
01:37:30,485 --> 01:37:32,112
You!

1026
01:37:32,754 --> 01:37:34,745
You're dead!

1027
01:37:34,956 --> 01:37:36,423
No, l'm not.

1028
01:37:39,094 --> 01:37:40,527
Sam.

1029
01:37:40,695 --> 01:37:44,187
-Sam, for chrissake!
-Sorry, partner.

1030
01:37:44,366 --> 01:37:46,926
You really shouldn't have killed Kelly.

1031
01:37:47,102 --> 01:37:50,469
You shouldn't have killed that kid
out in the glades either.

1032
01:37:50,639 --> 01:37:53,472
-What was his name?
-Davy.

1033
01:38:06,621 --> 01:38:08,248
That's my son, Walter.

1034
01:38:08,423 --> 01:38:13,520
He's been doing this a long time,
so don't be afraid. Please, come on in.

1035
01:38:13,695 --> 01:38:17,096
Thank you so much
for coming down to the glades.

1036
01:38:30,078 --> 01:38:34,981
Did you come here to watch Walter,
or is this an official visit?

1037
01:38:35,250 --> 01:38:37,411
No. Actually, it's my day off.

1038
01:38:39,254 --> 01:38:40,983
l thought you looked different.

1039
01:38:41,156 --> 01:38:43,716
l came because l was hoping
you would talk to me.

1040
01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:46,557
About Suzie?

1041
01:38:46,728 --> 01:38:50,494
Actually, l was wondering if you would
talk to me about Ray Duquette.

1042
01:38:55,937 --> 01:38:58,462
He used to come around here.

1043
01:38:59,307 --> 01:39:02,674
He had a thing going
with one of the girls--

1044
01:39:02,844 --> 01:39:06,405
Girls. Over at the glades.

1045
01:39:07,248 --> 01:39:10,843
Got sort of hung up on her,
from what l hear.

1046
01:39:11,586 --> 01:39:15,317
-She still work there?
-Not after that night.

1047
01:39:15,890 --> 01:39:18,051
All l know is, the next morning...

1048
01:39:18,226 --> 01:39:22,162
...she was gone and a boy was dead.

1049
01:39:22,330 --> 01:39:27,768
Seminole kid named Davy.
He had a crush on Ray's whore.

1050
01:39:31,139 --> 01:39:35,405
Caught Ray slapping her around,
and he tried to stop it.

1051
01:39:36,411 --> 01:39:39,278
So Ray killed him.

1052
01:39:40,048 --> 01:39:42,278
Suzie saw it.

1053
01:39:42,617 --> 01:39:46,485
So he busted her and sent her up.

1054
01:39:46,654 --> 01:39:51,318
You know, just to prove that he could.

1055
01:39:52,060 --> 01:39:55,120
That's all there is to say
about Ray Duquette.

1056
01:40:06,274 --> 01:40:08,242
To Ray.

1057
01:40:08,610 --> 01:40:12,239
We won. Sam, it's over.

1058
01:40:19,721 --> 01:40:24,055
Wow. Talk about paranoid.
Take a look around us, Sam.

1059
01:40:24,225 --> 01:40:28,423
You're gonna have to teach me how to
drive this before l can get rid of you.

1060
01:40:40,074 --> 01:40:41,473
Okay, Toller.

1061
01:40:41,643 --> 01:40:44,373
l wanna trim the sail.
Grab a hold of that winch.

1062
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:49,148
-Fuck the winch. l wanna drive.
-lt doesn't work that way.

1063
01:40:49,317 --> 01:40:51,444
You don't drive it, you sail it.

1064
01:40:52,454 --> 01:40:54,649
Now, get on that winch.

1065
01:40:55,790 --> 01:40:58,691
l just wanna cruise for a while.

1066
01:41:02,297 --> 01:41:06,893
That's funny. That's one of the first
things l noticed about you, Sam.

1067
01:41:07,068 --> 01:41:09,969
You like to cruise.

1068
01:41:11,606 --> 01:41:15,474
-Suzie.
-Take college, for instance.

1069
01:41:15,643 --> 01:41:20,637
l bet the classes you took were ones
where the finals were multiple choice.

1070
01:41:21,416 --> 01:41:25,079
And you never bought the book.
You'd find a girl to loan you hers.

1071
01:41:25,253 --> 01:41:28,984
And then, of course, you'd have
to fuck her after that, right?

1072
01:41:29,157 --> 01:41:30,647
ls that how it went?

1073
01:41:33,628 --> 01:41:35,095
Yeah.

1074
01:41:37,465 --> 01:41:40,298
Well, l've got a good pop quiz for you.

1075
01:41:40,468 --> 01:41:42,561
Multiple choice, of course.

1076
01:41:43,905 --> 01:41:45,566
Before sailing on the Helios...

1077
01:41:45,740 --> 01:41:51,337
...Medea killed King Creon
and the princess with what?

1078
01:41:51,813 --> 01:41:53,440
A rock?

1079
01:41:54,349 --> 01:41:56,078
A spear gun?

1080
01:41:58,119 --> 01:41:59,677
Or a little poison?

1081
01:42:00,555 --> 01:42:02,648
Poison!

1082
01:42:06,461 --> 01:42:08,019
Good guess.

1083
01:42:22,176 --> 01:42:23,905
Van Ryan got old.

1084
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:27,037
He and his cronies would come here.

1085
01:42:27,215 --> 01:42:31,311
Hunt and whore.
They acted like a bunch of assholes.

1086
01:42:31,686 --> 01:42:34,280
One trip, he showed up with this girl...

1087
01:42:34,455 --> 01:42:37,720
...he'd picked up somewhere.

1088
01:42:37,892 --> 01:42:39,985
Gotten her pregnant.

1089
01:42:41,029 --> 01:42:43,361
Dumped her in the swamp.

1090
01:42:43,698 --> 01:42:45,666
Poor girl was dead in a year.

1091
01:42:49,103 --> 01:42:52,937
That came with her.

1092
01:42:53,541 --> 01:42:55,304
And the child?

1093
01:42:55,476 --> 01:42:59,105
Well, she had it.
Before she drank herself to death.

1094
01:43:00,648 --> 01:43:03,640
Wasn't exactly a love child.

1095
01:43:14,762 --> 01:43:17,322
So you're not her grandmother.

1096
01:43:18,433 --> 01:43:21,493
l raised her like l was.

1097
01:43:22,036 --> 01:43:26,268
But, no. Walt was my only child.
He was a good boy.

1098
01:43:26,441 --> 01:43:28,602
Until the Army took him.

1099
01:43:28,776 --> 01:43:32,337
So Suzie and Sandra Van Ryan
were half sisters.

1100
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:37,249
And the other girl, Kelly?
Suzie's niece.

1101
01:43:47,962 --> 01:43:51,989
Well, it may be good news or not.
I don't know. We'll start with the letter.

1102
01:43:52,166 --> 01:43:55,658
-H.
-Yes, there are two H's.

1103
01:44:19,060 --> 01:44:20,925
Nice truck.

1104
01:44:28,903 --> 01:44:30,666
Selling your boat?

1105
01:44:35,743 --> 01:44:38,041
This was Suzie's boat.

1106
01:44:38,713 --> 01:44:41,204
Guess she won't be needing it now.

1107
01:44:43,017 --> 01:44:47,078
Funny. l wouldn't have guessed
Suzie was a sailor.

1108
01:44:49,457 --> 01:44:53,621
Old lady had her tested once.
They said her lQ was way up there.

1109
01:44:53,795 --> 01:44:57,663
Around 200 or some such shit.

1110
01:44:57,832 --> 01:45:01,324
That girl could do just about
anything she put her mind to.

1111
01:46:13,040 --> 01:46:14,735
Hi.

1112
01:46:15,443 --> 01:46:17,308
What are you doing out here?

1113
01:46:18,246 --> 01:46:20,510
l'm running away.

1114
01:46:21,315 --> 01:46:23,476
You think that's wise?

1115
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,652
Guess what else?

1116
01:46:31,692 --> 01:46:33,660
l have toys.

1117
01:46:38,699 --> 01:46:40,826
l suppose one taste won't hurt.

1118
01:46:52,313 --> 01:46:53,837
You know...

1119
01:46:54,015 --> 01:46:57,507
...that weekend l got busted,
l called you about a hundred times.

1120
01:47:02,190 --> 01:47:06,126
l really believed that stuff
about you being my friend.

1121
01:47:08,462 --> 01:47:09,759
Was l naive.

1122
01:47:14,268 --> 01:47:16,327
l can't decide what came out better.

1123
01:47:16,504 --> 01:47:21,874
That little straw up Kelly's nose
or that dildo shoved up her ass.

1124
01:47:23,044 --> 01:47:25,535
What do you think, Mr. Lombardo?

1125
01:47:39,861 --> 01:47:42,295
Seems to like the same places you do.

1126
01:47:42,830 --> 01:47:47,392
-Funny you never met.
-Yeah, real funny.

1127
01:47:47,568 --> 01:47:52,028
You know, you're wrong about this,
and l could get busted on the spot.

1128
01:47:53,007 --> 01:47:57,671
Trust me. The guy's dirty. He'll love it.
Especially the part about killing me.

1129
01:47:57,845 --> 01:48:01,303
Now, get out of here.
Go make yourself a new friend.

1130
01:48:13,561 --> 01:48:15,722
What are you drinking?

1131
01:48:19,800 --> 01:48:22,564
We gotta stop. l'm gonna come.

1132
01:48:24,605 --> 01:48:27,836
That never seemed
to worry you at the glades.

1133
01:48:29,410 --> 01:48:34,575
-That's not your line....
-Say you love me.

1134
01:48:36,150 --> 01:48:40,246
l love you.
Now, give me the line.

1135
01:48:40,421 --> 01:48:44,016
No little girl can ever make me come.

1136
01:48:57,605 --> 01:49:01,701
You got the pressure too tight.
You're gonna crush the evidence.

1137
01:49:06,247 --> 01:49:08,909
Oh, for chrissake.

1138
01:49:23,965 --> 01:49:26,365
-Hello, Kelly.
-What are you doing here?

1139
01:50:13,481 --> 01:50:15,381
May l ask you a question, Ms. Toller?

1140
01:50:17,918 --> 01:50:21,081
Did you enjoy being
a guest of the state?

1141
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:25,656
l hope l never make you mad.

1142
01:50:29,597 --> 01:50:32,259
Cash is just walking-around money.

1143
01:50:32,900 --> 01:50:35,095
The check is the balance
of the numbered account...

1144
01:50:35,269 --> 01:50:37,737
...minus the million we set aside
for Ruby and Walter...

1145
01:50:37,905 --> 01:50:39,566
...less my usual fee.

1146
01:50:41,475 --> 01:50:43,136
Case closed.

1147
01:50:55,322 --> 01:50:57,119
Suzie.

1148
01:50:59,760 --> 01:51:01,751
Be good.
