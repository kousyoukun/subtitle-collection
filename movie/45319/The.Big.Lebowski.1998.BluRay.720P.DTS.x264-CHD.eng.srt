Pledging their love to the ground

00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:19,176
NARRATOR: Way out West there was this fella.

4
00:00:19,177 --> 00:00:21,612
Fella I wanna tell you about.

5
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:25,148
Fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.

6
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:28,852
£east that was the handle that his loving parents gave him.

7
00:00:28,853 --> 00:00:31,989
But he never had much use for it himself.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,126
This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.

9
00:00:36,127 --> 00:00:38,262
Now Dude,

10
00:00:38,263 --> 00:00:42,032
that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from.

11
00:00:42,033 --> 00:00:47,504
But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me,

12
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,240
and a lot about where he lived likewise.

13
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:52,509
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,178
NARRATOR: But then again,

15
00:00:54,179 --> 00:00:57,347
maybe that's why I found the place so darned interesting.

16
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,383
I know when night has gone

17
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:02,352
That a new world's born at dawn

18
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,456
NARRATOR: They call Los Angeles the City of Angels.

19
00:01:06,457 --> 00:01:09,593
I didn't find it to be that, exactly.

20
00:01:09,594 --> 00:01:13,397
But I'll allow there are some nice folks there.

21
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:16,166
Course, I can't say I seen London,

22
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,502
and I never been to France,

23
00:01:18,503 --> 00:01:23,607
and I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, as the fella says.

24
00:01:23,608 --> 00:01:25,609
But I'll tell you what,

25
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,981
after seeing Los Angeles and this here story I'm about to unfold,

26
00:01:30,982 --> 00:01:33,917
well, I guess I've seen something

27
00:01:33,918 --> 00:01:38,188
every bit as stupefying as you can see in any of those other places,

28
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:40,424
and in English, too.

29
00:01:40,425 --> 00:01:43,427
So I can die with a smile on my face

30
00:01:43,428 --> 00:01:46,227
without feeling like the good Lord gypped me.

31
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,333
Now, this here story I'm about to unfold

32
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:52,436
took place back in the early '9·s,

33
00:01:52,437 --> 00:01:57,374
just about the time of our conflict with Saddam and the lraqis.

34
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,044
I only mention it 'cause sometimes there's a man...

35
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:03,146
I won't say a hero.

36
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:05,282
'Cause what's a hero?

37
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:07,684
But sometimes there's a man...

38
00:02:07,685 --> 00:02:10,787
And I'm talking about the Dude here.

39
00:02:10,788 --> 00:02:13,557
Sometimes there's a man...

40
00:02:13,558 --> 00:02:18,228
Well, he's the man for his time and place.

41
00:02:18,229 --> 00:02:21,031
He fits right in there.

42
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:24,434
And that's the Dude in Los Angeles.

43
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,238
And even if he is a lazy man,

44
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,941
and the Dude was most certainly that,

45
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:34,778
quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles county,

46
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,647
which would place him high in the running for laziest worldwide.

47
00:02:39,884 --> 00:02:42,786
But sometimes there's a man...

48
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,586
Sometimes there's a man...

49
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:50,527
Well, I lost my train of thought here.

50
00:02:50,528 --> 00:02:51,791
But...

51
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,198

00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,177
Dude, the Chinaman is not the issue here.

167
00:08:41,178 --> 00:08:43,680
So, who... Jeff Lebowski.

168
00:08:43,681 --> 00:08:46,883
The other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire.

169
00:08:46,884 --> 00:08:49,719
That's fucking interesting, man. That's fucking interesting.

170
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,790
Plus, he has the wealth, obviously, and the resources,

171
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:56,393
so that there's no reason, there's no fucking reason

172
00:08:56,394 --> 00:08:59,195
why his wife should go out and owe money all over town,

173
00:08:59,196 --> 00:09:01,731
and then they come and they pee on your fucking rug!

174
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,066
Am I wrong? No.

175
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,701
Am I wrong? Yeah, but...

176
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:05,835
WALTER: Okay then.

177
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,327
(WALTER CLEARS THROAT)

178
00:09:07,571 --> 00:09:10,674
That rug really tied the room together, did it not?

179
00:09:10,674 --> 00:09:12,675
Fucking A. And this guy peed on it.

180
00:09:12,676 --> 00:09:14,077
Donny, please.

181
00:09:14,078 --> 00:09:15,345
You know, this is the fucking guy...

182
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,714
I could find this fucking Lebowski guy.

183
00:09:17,715 --> 00:09:20,150
His name is Lebowski? That's your name, Dude.

184
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:24,521
This is the guy who should compensate me for the fucking rug.

185
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:28,224
His wife goes out and owes money all over town, and they pee on my rug?

186
00:09:28,225 --> 00:09:30,360
They pee on your fucking rug?

187
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,057
Peed on my fucking rug. That's right, Dude.

188
00:09:34,498 --> 00:09:36,831
They peed on your fucking rug.

189
00:09:38,436 --> 00:09:40,203
This is the study.

190
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,906
As you can see, the various commendations, awards...

191
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:46,876
"Jeffrey Lebowski." ...citations, honorary degrees, et cetera.

192
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:50,613
Very impressive. Oh, please feel free to inspect them.

193
00:09:50,614 --> 00:09:53,316
Oh. No, I'm not really... Oh, please. Please.

194
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:55,351
That is the key to the city of Pasadena,

195
00:09:55,352 --> 00:10:00,790
which Mr. Lebowski received two years ago in recognition of his various civic...

196
00:10:00,791 --> 00:10:05,562
Oh! That's the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever Award,

197
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,797
which is given... Oh, not necessarily given every year.

198
00:10:07,798 --> 00:10:08,998
Hey, is this...

199
00:10:08,999 --> 00:10:10,300
Given only when there's a worthy somebody...

200
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:11,668
Is this him with Nancy?

201
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:15,004
Yes, indeed, that is Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes.

202
00:10:15,005 --> 00:10:16,306
It was taken when Mrs. Reagan...

203
00:10:16,307 --> 00:10:19,042
That's Lebowski on the left there?

204
00:10:19,043 --> 00:10:21,845
Of course. Mr. Lebowski, on the left... So he's a...

205
00:10:21,846 --> 00:10:24,514
You know, a handicapped kind of guy?

206
00:10:24,515 --> 00:10:26,677
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.

207
00:10:27,384 --> 00:10:30,620
This picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation.

208
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:31,788
Yes, yes.

209
00:10:31,789 --> 00:10:33,823
Not of California. Good shot.

210
00:10:33,824 --> 00:10:36,126
In fact, he met privately with the President,

211
00:10:36,127 --> 00:10:38,962
though, unfortunately, there wasn't enough time for a photo opportunity.

212
00:10:38,963 --> 00:10:40,997
Oh, Nancy's pretty good. Oh, wonderful woman.

213
00:10:40,998 --> 00:10:43,366
We were very happy to... These are...

214
00:10:43,367 --> 00:10:46,136
Oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak.

215
00:10:46,137 --> 00:10:47,504
Different mothers, huh?

216
00:10:47,505 --> 00:10:49,906
No, they're not... Racially, he's pretty cool?

217

(LAUGHING)

218
00:10:51,575 --> 00:10:53,443
They're not literally his children.

219
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,779
They're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,

220
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,882
inner city children of promise, but without the necessary means for...

221
00:10:58,883 --> 00:11:00,984
Necessary means for a higher education,

222
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:04,487
so Mr. Lebowski is committed to sending all of them to college.

223
00:11:04,488 --> 00:11:05,889
Excuse me. Oh, geez.

224
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,791
Thank you. Thank you.

225
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:12,252
Far out. Think he's got room for one more? One... Oh.

226
00:11:13,898 --> 00:11:15,231
You never went to college.

227
00:11:15,232 --> 00:11:17,367
Please, don't touch that. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I did,

228
00:11:17,368 --> 00:11:19,736
but, you know, I spent most of my time

229
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:22,972
occupying various administration buildings,

230
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,841
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

231
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:28,111
(LAUGHING) breaking into the ROTC and bowling.

But I am very busy, as I imagine you are.

00:11:45,362 --> 00:11:46,963
What can I do for you, sir?

239
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:50,567
Well, sir, it's this rug I have.

240
00:11:50,568 --> 00:11:52,669
It really tied the room together.

241

You told Brandt on the phone. He told me.

242
00:11:55,439 --> 00:11:56,964
Where do I fit in?

243
00:11:57,641 --> 00:12:00,944
Well, they were looking for you, these two guys.

244
00:12:00,945 --> 00:12:03,012
You know, they... I'll say it again.

245
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:06,216
You told Brandt on the phone. He told me.

246
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:08,351
I know what happened. Yes, yes.

247
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:11,654
Oh, so you know that they were trying to piss on your rug.

248
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:13,923
Did I urinate on your rug?

249
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:16,259
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my rug?

No. Like I said, Woo peed on my rug.

I just want to understand this, sir.

This aggression will not stand, man.

277
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:31,401
I mean, your wife owes money...

278
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:34,437
My wife is not the issue here!

279
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:37,907
I hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance,

280
00:13:37,908 --> 00:13:39,375
which is ample.

But if she does not, that is her problem, not mine,

Get a job, sir!

297

Okay.

897
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:37,518
I asked my father about his withdrawal of $1 million from the foundation account,

898
00:46:37,519 --> 00:46:39,420
and he told me about this abduction,

905
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:56,337
However, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter.

that instead of, you know, running around, blaming me...

966
00:49:45,707 --> 00:49:47,975
You know, given the nature of all this new shit,

967
00:49:47,976 --> 00:49:53,914
you know, this could be a lot more complex...

968
00:49:53,915 --> 00:49:58,953
I mean, it's not just... It might not be just such a simple... You know?

970

Well, I'll tell you what I'm blathering about.

971

I've got information, man.

And, shit, man,

974
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:14,701
she kidnapped herself.

975
00:50:17,739 --> 00:50:20,541
Well, sure, man. Look at it. You know?

And that's cool. That's cool.

979
00:50:34,789 --> 00:50:38,692
I'm saying she needs money, man.

980
00:50:38,693 --> 00:50:42,357
And, you know, of course they're gonna say they didn't get it

981
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:46,567
because she wants more, man.

982
00:50:46,568 --> 00:50:49,003
She's gotta feed the monkey. I mean...

983
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:54,508
Hasn't that ever occurred to you, man?

984

Sir?

985
00:50:57,746 --> 00:51:01,215
No, Mr. Lebowski, it had not occurred to me.

986
00:51:01,216 --> 00:51:03,517
That had not occurred to us, Dude.

987

993
00:51:21,069 --> 00:51:24,138
My concern is, and I've gotta check it with my accountant,

994
00:51:24,139 --> 00:51:26,941
that this might bump me up into a higher tax...

even in the modest task which was your charge,

1000
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:49,163
since you have stolen my money,

1001
00:51:49,164 --> 00:51:52,933
since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust,

1002
00:51:52,934 --> 00:51:56,971
I have no choice but to tell these bums

1003
00:51:56,972 --> 00:51:59,273
to do whatever is necessary

1004
00:51:59,274 --> 00:52:03,404
to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

1005
00:52:04,679 --> 00:52:08,816

1007

Whose toe was it, Walter? How the fuck should I know?

1013

I do know that nothing about it indicates... The nail polish, Walter.

Fine, Dude.

1015

As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe...

and then they're gonna kill me.

Now, what happened to your face?

Did Jackie Treehorn do that as well?

No, it was the chief of police of Malibu, a real reactionary.

1909
01:46:36,781 --> 01:46:40,718
He was a man who loved the outdoors and bowling.

1910
01:46:40,852 --> 01:46:44,655
And as a surfer he explored the beaches of Southern California

1911
01:46:44,656 --> 01:46:47,558
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo

1912
01:46:47,559 --> 01:46:50,119
and up to Pismo.

1913
01:46:50,929 --> 01:46:52,192
He died...

1914
01:46:53,164 --> 01:46:57,368
He died as so many young men of his generation, before his time.

1915
01:46:57,369 --> 01:47:00,638
In your wisdom, Lord, you took him,

1916
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:04,041
as you took so many bright, flowering young men

1917
01:47:04,042 --> 01:47:06,944
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

1918
01:47:06,945 --> 01:47:08,674
at Hill 364.

1919
01:47:09,981 --> 01:47:12,348
These young men gave their lives,

1920
01:47:12,951 --> 01:47:14,419
and so did Donny.

1921
01:47:16,555 --> 01:47:18,546
Donny, who loved bowling.

1922
01:47:21,593 --> 01:47:22,583
And so,

1923
01:47:24,229 --> 01:47:26,595
Theodore Donald Kerabatsos,

1924
01:47:27,899 --> 01:47:32,996
in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been,

1925
01:47:34,339 --> 01:47:37,138
we commit your final mortal remains

1926
01:47:38,043 --> 01:47:40,443
to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean

1927
01:47:41,913 --> 01:47:43,882
which you loved so well.

1928
01:47:46,217 --> 01:47:48,311
Good night, sweet prince.

1929
01:47:59,798 --> 01:48:01,027
(lNHALES)

1930
01:48:03,468 --> 01:48:04,868
Shit.

1931
01:48:06,805 --> 01:48:08,830
Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1932
01:48:10,642 --> 01:48:13,844
Goddamn wind. Fuck, god damn it, Walter!

1933
01:48:13,845 --> 01:48:16,213
You fucking asshole! Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1934
01:48:16,214 --> 01:48:18,515
Everything's a fucking travesty with you, man!

1935
01:48:18,516 --> 01:48:20,184
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

1936
01:48:20,185 --> 01:48:22,753
What was that shit about Vietnam? Dude, I'm sorry.

1937
01:48:22,754 --> 01:48:25,155
What the fuck does anything have to do with Vietnam?

1938
01:48:25,156 --> 01:48:27,224
Dude, I'm sorry. What the fuck are you talking about?

1939
01:48:27,225 --> 01:48:28,818
Dude, I'm sorry.

1940
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:32,958
Fucking...

1941
01:48:39,938 --> 01:48:41,406
Fuck, Walter.

1942
01:48:43,308 --> 01:48:44,798
Come on, Dude.

1943
01:48:45,643 --> 01:48:47,305
Hey, fuck it, man.

1944
01:48:51,216 --> 01:48:52,843
Let's go bowling.

1945
01:49:16,341 --> 01:49:19,640
And when you're sittin' there

1946
01:49:20,278 --> 01:49:23,407
In your silk upholstered chair

1947
01:49:24,916 --> 01:49:28,944
Talkin' to some rich folks that you know

1948
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:35,123
Well, I hope you don't see me

1949
01:49:36,127 --> 01:49:39,359
In my ragged company

1950
01:49:40,131 --> 01:49:45,194
O? but you know I could never be alone

1951
01:49:47,372 --> 01:49:50,441
Two oat sodas, Gary. Right. Good luck tomorrow.

1952
01:49:50,442 --> 01:49:53,977
Yeah, thanks, man. I was sorry to hear about Donny.

1953
01:49:53,978 --> 01:49:56,846
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

1954
01:49:57,682 --> 01:50:01,752
sometimes you eat the bear, and sometimes, you know...

1955
01:50:01,753 --> 01:50:03,016
Hey, man.

1956
01:50:03,822 --> 01:50:07,091
How do you do, Dude? I wondered if I'd see you again.

1957
01:50:07,092 --> 01:50:09,226
I wouldn't miss the semis.

1958
01:50:09,227 --> 01:50:10,928
Oh, yeah? How's things been going?

1959
01:50:10,929 --> 01:50:14,131
Well, you know, strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

1960
01:50:14,132 --> 01:50:16,828
Sure. I got you. Yeah.

1961
01:50:18,403 --> 01:50:19,503
Thanks, Gary.

1962
01:50:19,504 --> 01:50:21,939
Well, take care, man. Gotta get back.

1963
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:25,075
Sure. Take it easy, Dude. Oh, yeah.

1964
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:27,244
I know that you will.

1965
01:50:27,245 --> 01:50:30,579
Yeah. Well, the Dude abides.

1966
01:50:34,586 --> 01:50:35,780
Walter.

1967
01:50:37,489 --> 01:50:39,457
The Dude abides.

1968
01:50:43,361 --> 01:50:46,695
I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that.

1969
01:50:47,999 --> 01:50:50,300
It's good knowing he's out there,

1970
01:50:50,301 --> 01:50:54,363
the Dude, taking her easy for all us sinners.

1971
01:50:57,108 --> 01:50:59,270
I sure hope he makes the finals.

1972
01:51:00,879 --> 01:51:03,080
Well, that about does her.

1973
01:51:03,081 --> 01:51:04,571
Wraps her all up.

1974
01:51:06,184 --> 01:51:09,643
Things seem to have worked out pretty good for the Dude and Walter.

1975
01:51:10,321 --> 01:51:13,587
And it was a pretty good story, don't you think?

1976
01:51:14,459 --> 01:51:16,791
Made me laugh to beat the band.

1977
01:51:17,428 --> 01:51:18,896
Parts anyway.

1978
01:51:20,465 --> 01:51:22,627
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1979
01:51:23,735 --> 01:51:28,764
But then I happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way.

1980
01:51:30,441 --> 01:51:33,775
I guess that's the way the whole darned human comedy keeps

1981
01:51:34,345 --> 01:51:36,747
perpetuating itself

1982
01:51:36,748 --> 01:51:38,910
down through the generations.

1983
01:51:39,417 --> 01:51:43,684
Westward the wagons, across the sands of time until we...

1984
01:51:44,889 --> 01:51:48,086
Oh, look at me. I'm rambling again.

1985
01:51:49,494 --> 01:51:51,986
Well, I hope you folks enjoyed yourselves.

1986
01:51:52,463 --> 01:51:54,796
Catch you later on down the trail.

1987
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,095
Say, friend, you got any more of that good sarsaparilla?

1988
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:26,129
Take me down, little Susie

1989
01:52:26,130 --> 01:52:27,962
Take me down

Send me dead flowers every morning

Send me dead flowers by the mail

1994
01:52:56,327 --> 01:53:00,787
Send me dead flowers to my wedding

1995
01:53:03,334 --> 01:53:10,502
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

1996
01:53:11,609 --> 01:53:16,013
No, I won't forget to put roses

1997
01:53:16,014 --> 01:53:20,314
On your grave
