1
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:12,230
See them tumbling down

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,470

Pledging their love to the ground

3
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,170
在西部有一个家伙
Way out West there was this fella.

4
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:21,610
我正要说关于他的故事
Fella I wanna tell you about.

5
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,140
他叫杰弗里.李波斯基
Fella by the name of Jeff Lebowski.

6
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,850
至少那是他亲爱的 父母给他的
ast that was the handle that his loving parents gave him.

7
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:31,980
然而他却不太喜欢
But he never had much use for it himself.

8
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:36,120
这个李波斯基 称自己为"酷哥"
This Lebowski, he called himself the Dude.

9
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,260
"酷哥"
Now Dude,

10
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:42,030
是在我家乡里 没人会用的称呼
that's a name no one would self-apply where I come from.

11
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:47,500
然而关于这个 酷哥的传奇却很多虽然对我没多大意义
But then there was a lot about the Dude that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me,

12
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,240
他居住的地方
and a lot about where he lived likewise.

13
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,500
也是光怪陆离
Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds

14
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,340
但这也许是我觉得
But then again,maybe that's why I found the place so darned interesting.

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,350
那地方很有趣的原因
I know when night has gone That a new world's born at dawn

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,450
人们称洛杉矶为天使之城
They call Los Angeles the City of Angels.

17
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,590
我倒没见到什么天使
I didn't find it to be that, exactly.

18
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,390
但那里还是有一些好人的
But I'll allow there are some nice folks there.

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,160
因为我没去过伦敦
Course, I can't say I seen London,

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,500
也没到过法国
and I never been to France,

21
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:23,600
也没见过传说中的内衣女王
and I ain't never seen no queen in her damned undies, as the fella says.

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
但我告诉你
But I'll tell you what,

23
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:30,980
在了解洛杉矶之后并听了我即将说的 故事之后
after seeing Los Angeles and this here story I'm about to unfold,

24
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,910
你会觉得此事的悲惨无奈也是别处少见
well, I guess I've seen something

25
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,180
若我能把这事说下来
every bit as stupefying as you can see in any of those other places,

26
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:40,420
用英语
and in English, too.

27
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,420
便是死也无憾了
So I can die with a smile on my face

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,220
也不会再怨天尤人了
without feeling like the good Lord gypped me.

29
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,330
我将要讲述的 这个故事...
Now, this here story I'm about to unfold

30
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,430
发生在90年代早期
took place back in the early '90,

31
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:57,370
大概在我国与伊拉克 发生冲突的时候
just about the time of our conflict with Saddam and the lraqis.

32
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:01,040
我提起这些 是因为一个人...
I only mention it 'cause sometimes there's a man...

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,140
我不会说一个英雄
I won't say a hero.

34
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,280
因为英雄是什么呢?
'Cause what's a hero?

35
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,680
那时候有一个人...
But sometimes there's a man...

36
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,780
这里说的就是酷哥
And I'm talking about the Dude here.

37
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:13,550
那个人...
Sometimes there's a man...

38
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:18,220
在那个时代 那个地方
Well, he's the man for his time and place.

39
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,030
他适得其所的活着
He fits right in there.

40
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:24,430
就是这个洛城酷哥
And that's the Dude in Los Angeles.

41
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:28,230
即使他是个懒惰的人...
And even if he is a lazy man,

42
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,940
酷哥很可能是...
and the Dude was most certainly that,

43
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,770
洛杉矶最懒的人
quite possibly the laziest in Los Angeles county,

44
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,640
在世界懒人排行榜的 位置也一定很高
which would place him high in the running for laziest worldwide.

45
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,780
那时候有一个男人
But sometimes there's a man...

46
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,580
那时候这个男人...
Sometimes there's a man...

47
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,520
我的思路断开了
Well, I lost my train of thought here.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,790
不管怎样
But...

49
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,190
我对他的介绍已经足够了
Hell, I done introduced him enough.

50
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,630
一次集体的行动
BUSH ON TV: ...with them all for a collective action.

51
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,400
这不会停止
This will not stand.

52
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,930
这不会停止 对科威特的侵略
This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.

53
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,370

Here on the range I belong

54
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,710

Drifting along

55
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,910

With the tumbling

56
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,350

Tumbleweeds

57
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,000
钱在哪里 李波斯基?
Where's the money, Lebowski?

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,270
我要那些钱 李波斯基
I want that money, Lebowski.

59
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:40,840
邦妮说你非常富有的
Bunny says you're good for it.

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,640
钱在哪里 李波斯基?
Where's the money, Lebowski?

61
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,080
钱在哪里 李波斯基?
Where's the money, Lebowski?

62
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,600
钱到底在哪里 混蛋?!
Where's the fucking money, shithead?

63
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,850
在哪里了...我找一下
It's down there somewhere. Let me take another look.

64
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,520
别耍花招!
Don't fuck with us.

65
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:00,860
你老婆欠了 杰奇 特里赫姆的钱
Your wife owes money to Jackie Treehorn,

66
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,800
就是你欠了 杰奇 特里赫姆的钱
that means you owe money to Jackie Treehorn.

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,030
赖债不还就要吃苦头 李波斯基
Ever thus to deadbeats, Lebowski.

68
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,690
不要...
No, don't do...

69
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,210
别在我地毯上
Not on the rug, man. MAN: See?

70
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,610
看到了吗 李波斯基? 看到了吗?
See what happens, Lebowski? You see what happens?

71
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:19,640
没人会叫我李波斯基 你们找错人了
Nobody calls me Lebowski. You got the wrong guy.

72
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,510
我是酷哥
I'm the Dude, man.

73
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:24,350
你的名字是李波斯基
Your name's Lebowski, Lebowski.

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,220
你老婆叫邦妮
Your wife is Bunny.

75
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,450
我老婆邦妮?
My wife? Bunny?

76
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:31,520
你看到我手指上 有结婚戒指吗?
Do you see a wedding ring on my finger?

77
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,890
这地方像是 结了婚的人住的吗?
Does this place look like I'm fucking married?

78
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:36,060
马桶的坐板放起来了
The toilet seat's up, man!

79
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,070
这是什么?
What the fuck is this?

80
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:48,270
显然你不打高尔夫
Obviously you're not a golfer.

81
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:53,080
吴?
Woo? Yeah.

82
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,740
怎么了?那家伙像是个富翁吗?
Isn't this guy supposed to be a millionaire?

83
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,310
操!
Fuck.

84
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:01,620
你说呢?
Yeah. What do you think?

85
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,990
他样子像个失败者
He looks like a fucking loser.

86
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:06,830
起码我有教养
Hey, at least I'm housebroken.

87
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:08,630
浪费时间!
Fucking time-waster.

88
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,490
谢了 混蛋
Thanks a lot, asshole.

89
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:20,360

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

90
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,910

La-la-la, la, la, la, la

91
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:27,280

La-la-la, la, la, la-la la-la

92
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,440

la, la-la

93
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,350

La-la-la

94
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,690

La-la-la, la-la-la

95
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:38,050

La-la, la-la

96
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:43,120

The man in me will do

97
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,490

Nearly any task

98
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:50,900

And as for compensation

99
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,400

There's little he would ask

100
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,800

Take a woman like you

101
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,100

To get through

102
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,670

To the man in me

103
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:08,390

Storm clouds are raging

104
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,320

All around my door

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,960

I think to myself

106
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,420

I might not take it anymore

107
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,170

Take a woman like your kind

108
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:25,430

To find the man in me

109
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,940

But, oh

110
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:33,410

What a wonderful feeling

111
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:39,650

Just to know that you are near

112
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:46,410

Sets my heart a-reeling

113
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,930

From my toes

114
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,300

Up to my ears

115
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:58,600

The man in me will hide sometimes

116
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,230

To keep from being seen

117
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:05,280

But that's just because he doesn't want

118
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,280

To turn into some machine

119
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,720

Take a woman like you

120
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,390

To get through

121
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,250

To the man in me

122
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,790
我今晚手风很顺啊 记分吧 酷哥
I'm throwing rocks tonight. Mark it, Dude.

123
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,400
那是很有价值的地毯 那是...
I'm telling you, this was a valued rug. This was a...

124
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,000
那地毯和我的屋子很搭配
Yeah, man. It really tied the room together.

125
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,700
那是很有价值的...
This was a valued...

126
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,570
什么东西跟你房间很搭配 酷哥? 我的地毯
What tied the room together, Dude? My rug.

127
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:35,140
你刚才有听酷哥 讲故事吗 唐尼?
Were you listening to the Dude's story, Donny?

128
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,310
什么? 沃尔特
What? Walter.

129
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:39,110
你刚才有 听酷哥讲故事吗?
Were you listening to the Dude's story? I was bowling.

130
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,450
我刚在打保龄球啊 那你就什么 都不了解 唐尼
So you have no frame of reference here, Donny.

131
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:44,380
你就像一个中途 出来打岔的...
You're like a child who wanders into the middle of a movie and wants to know...

132
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,850
沃尔特 你想说明什么? 听我说 酷哥...
Walter, what's the point, man? There's no reason, here's my point, Dude.

133
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,590
没有任何理由...
There's no fucking reason why these two...

134
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,820
是啊 沃尔特 你想说明什么?
Yeah, Walter, what's your point?

135
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,920
沃尔特 你想说明什么
Walter, what is the...

136
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:55,430
听着 很明显到底是谁没搞清楚
Look, we all know who is at fault here.

137
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:57,700
你到底在说什么鬼话?
What the fuck are you talking about? Huh?

138
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,430
你...我...
No, what the fuck are you... I'm not...

139
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,440
我们在说 讨债打错人的事情 酷哥
We're talking about unchecked aggression here, Dude.

140
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,140
他到底在说什么鬼话?
What the fuck is he talking about? My rug.

141
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,010
我的地毯 算了 唐尼 歇一边去
Forget it, Donny!You're out of your element!

142
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,670
沃尔特 那个中国仔 在我地毯上撒尿
Walter, the Chinaman who peed on my rug,

143
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,610
但我找不着他赔偿我
I can't go give him a bill!

144
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,350
你到底在说什么?
So what the fuck are you talking about?

145
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,550
你到底在说什么?
What the fuck are you talking about?

146
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:16,780
我们讨论的不是 那个中国仔 酷哥
The Chinaman is not the issue here, Dude!

147
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,450
我在说忍耐的底限 酷哥
I'm talking about drawing a line in the sand, Dude.

148
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:21,950
如果越过了就要...
Across this line you do not...

149
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:26,120
还有 酷哥 叫他中国仔不太合适
Also, Dude, "Chinaman" is not the preferred nomenclature.

150
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,830
应该叫亚裔美国人
Asian-American, please.

151
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:31,330
沃尔特 这些人可不是那些修铁路的人
Walter, this isn't a guy who built the railroads here. This is a guy...

152
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:33,100
那家伙...你在说什么啊
What the fuck are you...

153
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:36,170
沃尔特 他在我的 地毯上撒尿
Walter, he peed on my rug!He peed on the Dude's rug.

154
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,800
唐尼 够了
Donny, you're out of your element.

155
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,170
酷哥 那中国仔不是重点所在
Dude, the Chinaman is not the issue here.

156
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:43,680
那谁...杰弗里.李波斯基
So, who... Jeff Lebowski.

157
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,880
另一个杰弗里.李波斯基 百万富翁
The other Jeffrey Lebowski. The millionaire.

158
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,710
那真的很有意思
That's fucking interesting, man. That's fucking interesting.

159
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,790
他有财有势
Plus, he has the wealth, obviously, and the resources,

160
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:56,390
所以没有任何理由...
so that there's no reason, there's no fucking reason

161
00:08:56,390 --> 00:08:59,190
他老婆会出来玩 并欠了债
why his wife should go out and owe money all over town,

162
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,730
然后那些人来你家 在你的地毯上撒尿!
and then they come and they pee on your fucking rug!

163
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,060
- 我说错了吗? - 不
- Am I wrong? - No.

164
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,700
我错了么? 但是...
Am I wrong? Yeah, but...

165
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:05,830
那么...
Okay then.

166
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:10,670
那地毯和你家屋子很搭 对吧?
That rug really tied the room together, did it not?

167
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:12,670
当然了!那个家伙还在上面撒尿
Fucking A. And this guy peed on it.

168
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,070
唐尼
Donny, please.

169
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,340
我能找到那个
You know, this is the fucking guy...

170
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,710
该死的李波斯基
I could find this fucking Lebowski guy.

171
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,150
他叫李波斯基? 你不就是这个名字么 酷哥
His name is Lebowski? That's your name, Dude.

172
00:09:20,150 --> 00:09:24,520
他应该赔偿我的地毯
This is the guy who should compensate me for the fucking rug.

173
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,220
他老婆出来玩 到处欠债 还让人在我的 地毯上撒尿?
His wife goes out and owes money all over town, and they pee on my rug?

174
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,360
他们在你的地毯上撒尿
They pee on your fucking rug?

175
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,050
没错 是啊 酷哥
Peed on my fucking rug. That's right, Dude.

176
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:36,830
他们在你的地毯上撒尿
They peed on your fucking rug.

177
00:09:38,430 --> 00:09:40,200
这里就是书房
This is the study.

178
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,900
有各种各样的奖状...
As you can see, the various commendations, awards...

179
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,870
"杰弗里.李波斯基" 荣誉学位等等

180
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,610
非常厉害 请随便查看
Very impressive. Oh, please feel free to inspect them.

181
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,310
我不是那么...
Oh. No, I'm not really... Oh, please. Please.

182
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,350
有请 那是帕萨里那城的钥匙
That is the key to the city of Pasadena,

183
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,790
两年前李波斯基先生 成为那里的杰出市民
which Mr. Lebowski received two years ago in recognition of his various civic...

184
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:05,560
那是洛杉矶商会的 商业成就奖
Oh!That's the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce Business Achiever Award,

185
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,790
并不是每年都颁发的
which is given... Oh, not necessarily given every year.

186
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:08,990
那是
Hey, is this...

187
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,660
他和南茜 (里根夫人)的合照?
Given only when there's a worthy somebody...Is this him with Nancy?

188
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,000
是的 那就是李波斯基 先生和第一夫人...
Yes, indeed, that is Mr. Lebowski with the first lady, yes.

189
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,040
在左边的就是 李波斯基?
It was taken when Mrs. Reagan...That's Lebowski on the left there?

190
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,840
当然了 李波斯基 先生就在左边 他是个跛子
Of course. Mr. Lebowski, on the left... So he's a...

191
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,510
他是残疾人?
You know, a handicapped kind of guy?

192
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,670
李波斯基先生 是伤残人士
Mr. Lebowski is disabled, yes.

193
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:30,620
那是在里根 任职总统时拍的照片
This picture was taken when Mrs. Reagan was first lady of the nation.

194
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,780
嗯 嗯
Yes, yes.

195
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,820
并不是加州州长那时候
Not of California. Good shot.

196
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,120
约翰教皇他曾经和总统私下会面
In fact, he met privately with the President,

197
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,960
但不幸的是当时没足够的时间拍照
though, unfortunately, there wasn't enough time for a photo opportunity.

198
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,990
南茜是个不错的女人
Oh, Nancy's pretty good. Oh, wonderful woman.

199
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:43,360
是啊 非常好
We were very happy to... These are...

200
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,130
这些是...李波斯基先生的子女
Oh, those are Mr. Lebowski's children, so to speak.

201
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:47,500
同父异母的?
Different mothers, huh?

202
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,900
很多种族 十分博爱啊
No, they're not... Racially, he's pretty cool?

203
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,440
他们并非他的子女
They're not literally his children.

204
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,770
他们是李波斯基先生的义子女
They're the Little Lebowski Urban Achievers,

205
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,880
他们缺乏接受...
inner city children of promise, but without the necessary means for...

206
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,980
高等教育的条件
Necessary means for a higher education,

207
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:04,480
于是李波斯基先生 资助他们上大学
so Mr. Lebowski is committed to sending all of them to college.

208
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,880
不好意思
Excuse me. Oh, geez.

209
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,790
谢谢 谢谢
Thank you. Thank you.

210
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:12,250
很好啊 还有多一个位子吗? 一个...
Far out. Think he's got room for one more? One... Oh.

211
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:15,230
你还没上过大学
You never went to college.

212
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,360
不好意思
Please, don't touch that. Oh, yeah, yeah. No, I did,

213
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,730
我上过的 但是...
but, you know, I spent most of my time

214
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:22,970
我大部分时间都跑到其他建筑里瞎逛了
occupying various administration buildings,

215
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,840
抽大麻...
smoking a lot of Thai stick,

216
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:28,110
溜进军营还有打保龄
breaking into the ROTC and bowling.

217
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,340
告诉你吧 布兰特 我就是混过来的
Tell you the truth, Brandt, I don't remember most of it.

218
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:39,380
你也叫李波斯基 我也叫李波斯基
Okay, sir. You're a Lebowski, I'm a Lebowski.

219
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:41,220
非常好
That's terrific.

220
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:44,090
但我现在很忙 我想你也应该是
But I am very busy, as I imagine you are.

221
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,960
我能帮你什么吗?
What can I do for you, sir?

222
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,560
先生...我有一块地毯
Well, sir, it's this rug I have.

223
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,660
和我家很搭调的地毯
It really tied the room together.

224
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:55,430
你在电话上告诉布兰特 他也告诉了我
You told Brandt on the phone. He told me.

225
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:56,960
这与我有什么关系?
Where do I fit in?

226
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:00,940
那两个男人要找的是你
Well, they were looking for you, these two guys.

227
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:03,010
你知道...我再说一次
You know, they... I'll say it again.

228
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:06,210
这些 布兰特已经告诉我了
You told Brandt on the phone. He told me.

229
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:08,350
我知道发生了什么事情
I know what happened. Yes, yes.

230
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:11,650
你知道他们想在 我的地毯上撒尿?
Oh, so you know that they were trying to piss on your rug.

231
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,920
请问我在那地毯上撒尿了吗?
Did I urinate on your rug?

232
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,250
你是问是否你亲自尿上面了?
You mean, did you personally come and pee on my rug?

233
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,320
你会说英语吗?
Hello!Do you speak English, sir?

234
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,260
你会说英语吗?
Parla usted English?

235
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,130
我再问一次 我在 那地毯上撒尿了吗?
I'll ask you again. Did I urinate on your rug?

236
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,630
没有 是那个叫吴的人做的
No. Like I said, Woo peed on my rug.

237
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,400
我只想明白这个
I just want to understand this, sir.

238
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,400
如果谁的地毯被人撒尿了
Every time a rug is micturated upon in this fair city,

239
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,240
我也要赔偿吗?
I have to compensate the person?

240
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,540
你看 我不是想来这里敲诈的
Come on, man. I'm not trying to scam anybody here.

241
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,440
我只是...
You know, I'm just...

242
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:42,970
你想找一些施舍就像其他的人...
You're just looking for a handout like every other...

243
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,620
你有工作吗 李波斯基先生?
Are you employed, Mr. Lebowski?

244
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,120
等一等 让我解释一下
Wait. Let me explain something to you.

245
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,060
我不是李波斯基
I am not Mr. Lebowski.

246
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,090
先生 你才是 我是酷哥
You're Mr. Lebowski. I'm the Dude.

247
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:59,830
别人都这样叫我
So that's what you call me. You know? That or His Dudeness,

248
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:02,400
就叫我酷哥吧
or Duder or, you know,

249
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,500
或者叫我酷哥斯 或者酷哥儿 随便什么样
El Duderino, if you're not into the whole brevity thing.

250
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
你有工作吗 先生?
Are you employed, sir?

251
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:10,280
工作?
Employed?

252
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,180
你不会穿成 这样去工作吧?
You don't go out looking for a job dressed like that, do you? On a weekday?

253
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,650
这是...
Is this a...

254
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:20,890
今天星期几了? 我有工作的 先生
What day is this? Well, I do work, sir.

255
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:25,120
- 如果你不介意 - 我介意的 酷哥介意
- So, if you don't mind... - No, I do mind. The Dude minds.

256
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,960
这是无法接受的
This will not stand, you know.

257
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,560
这绝对无法接受
This aggression will not stand, man.

258
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,400
你妻子欠了...
I mean, your wife owes money...

259
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:34,430
我妻子不是讨论的重点所在!
My wife is not the issue here!

260
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:37,900
我希望我妻子总有一天 学会使用她的零花钱
I hope that someday my wife will learn to live on her allowance,

261
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,370
那是足够的
which is ample.

262
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:42,310
如果她觉得不够 那也是她的问题 不是我的问题
But if she does not, that is her problem, not mine,

263
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,010
就像那地毯 是你的问题一样
just as the rug is your problem.

264
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:48,050
每个混混的命运 也是他自己的责任
Just as every bum's lot in life is his own responsibility,

265
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,850
不能去埋怨别人
regardless of who he chooses to blame.

266
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:54,020
我失去了双腿 也不会埋怨谁
I didn't blame anyone for the loss of my legs.

267
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,550
我在韩战的时候失去的
Some Chinaman took them from me in Korea.

268
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,060
但我后来也成功了
But I went out and achieved anyway.

269
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:03,460
我不能解决你的问题 先生 只有你可以
I cannot solve your problems, sir. Only you can.

270
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,100
去他妈的
Well, fuck it. Oh, fuck it.

271
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,240
对 去他妈的 那是你对所有事情的回答
Yes, that's your answer. That's your answer to everything.

272
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,070
纹在前额上吧
Tattoo it on your forehead!

273
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:15,640
你可别想翻身了 李波斯基先生!
Your revolution is over, Mr. Lebowski!

274
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,980

老先生说我可以拿走 这里任何一块地毯
The old man told me to take any rug in the house.

283

00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:11,860
你要我吹?
You want me to blow on your toes?

291
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:16,000
因为我自己吹不到
I can't blow that far.

292
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,380
你肯定他不会介意吗?
Are you sure he won't mind?

293
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,550
他什么也不介意 他是一个虚无主义者
Uli doesn't care about anything. He's a nihilist.

294
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,850
那真累啊
Oh, that must be exhausting.

295
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,720

We're all very fond of her. Very free-spirited.

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,700
布兰特不能观看 否则他就要给1百
Brandt can't watch though, or he has to pay $100.

302
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,870
太不可思议了
That's marvelous.

303
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,870
我要去找一个提款机
I'm just gonna go find a cash machine.

304

307
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,490
有志者事竟成
"lf you will it, it is no dream."

308
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,000
你迟到20分钟了 老兄 那是什么鬼东西?
Fucking 20 minutes late, man. What the fuck is that?

309
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,100
提奥多尔 何素的著作
Theodore Herzl. Huh?

310
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,240
"犹太人的国家" 酷哥 有志者事竟成
State of lsrael. If you will it, Dude, it is no dream.

311
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,240
你在说什么鬼话?
What the fuck are you talking about, man?

312
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,210
我问的是笼子里面有什么
The carrier. What's in the fucking carrier? Huh?

313
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:33,210
那是辛迪雅的狗 应该是波美拉尼亚狗
Oh!Cynthia's dog. Think it's a Pomeranian.

314
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,310
我不能把它留在家里不然它会吃家具
Can't leave him home alone or he eats the furniture.

315
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:38,150
辛迪雅和马迪去 夏威夷的时候我要看着它
I'm watching it while Cynthia and Marty Ackerman are in Hawaii.

316
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:40,150
你带着那讨厌的 狗来打保龄?
You brought a fucking Pomeranian bowling?

317
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,750
带来打保龄?
What do you mean, brought it bowling?

318
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,860
我不用给它租鞋子 我也不用给它买啤酒
I didn't rent it shoes. I'm not buying it a fucking beer.

319
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,020
他也不能顶替你个衰人 酷哥
He's not taking your fucking turn, Dude.

320
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:50,430
如果我那该死的前妻 在和他男友去玩的时候
Man, if my fucking ex-wife asked me to take care of her fucking dog

321
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:52,300
叫我帮她看着小狗
while she and her boyfriend went to Honolulu,

322
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,930
我一定会叫她见鬼去吧 为什么不能带上飞机?
I'd tell her to go fuck herself. Why can't she board it?

323
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,870
酷哥 首先你没有前妻
First of all, Dude, you don't have an ex.

324
00:16:56,870 --> 00:17:00,140
其次 这是一只名犬
Secondly, this is a fucking show dog with fucking papers.

325
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,940
不能带上飞机 它会发脾气的 毛也会掉下来
You can't board it. It gets upset. its hair falls out.

326
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,340
沃尔特...该死的名犬
Walter... Fucking dog has fucking papers.

327
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,080
越线了!
Over the line!Huh?

328
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,520
不好意思 烟仔 你的脚越线了
I'm sorry, Smokey. You were over the line. That's a foul.

329
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,250

胡说 沃尔特  记一个8分 酷哥
Bullshit, Walter. Mark it eight, Dude.

332
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:21,160

Smokey, this is not Nam. This is bowling. There are rules.

333
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,960
凡事都讲规则 沃尔特 只是...算了吧 烟仔是哥们儿
Hey, Walter, come on. Hey, man, it's Smokey.

334
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,230
他的脚越线了
So his toe slipped over a little, you know.

335
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:28,470
只是游戏而已 这是计分赛 决定
It's just a game, man. This is a league game.

336
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:30,500
谁进入下一次巡回赛
This determines who enters the next round robin.

337
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,340
- 我有错吗?- 你是没错 但我也没有...
- Am I wrong? - Yeah, but I wasn't...

338
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,940
我错了吗? 没错 但我得8分也没错
Am I wrong? Yeah, but I wasn't over.

339
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,740
给我记分表 酷哥 我要记一个8分
Give me the marker, Dude. I'm marking an eight.

340
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,470
烟仔
Smokey, my friend,

341
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,380
你在进入一个痛苦的世界 沃尔特
you're entering a world of pain. Walter, man.

342
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:47,180
记录一个8分 你在进入一个痛苦的世界
You mark that frame an eight, you're entering a world of pain.

343
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:49,820
我不会...一个痛苦的世界
I'm not... A world of pain.

344
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:52,020
酷哥 这是你的搭档
Look, Dude, this is your partner.

345
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,460
这个世界变疯狂了吗?!
Has the whole world gone crazy?

346
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,330
这里只有我在乎规则吗?
Am I the only one around here who gives a shit about the rules?

347
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:58,630
记零分!
Mark it zero!

348
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:00,870
他们在叫警察 伙计 拿开那东西
They're calling the cops, man. Put the piece away.

349
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:03,970
- 记零分!- 沃尔特 拿开那东西
- Mark it zero!- Walter, put the piece away.

350
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,270
沃尔特 你以为我在开玩笑吗?
Walter. You think I'm fucking around here?

351
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,900
记零分!
Mark it zero!

352
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,050
好了 一个零分

353
00:18:17,050 --> 00:18:19,110
你高兴了吗 疯子?
You happy, you crazy fuck?

354
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,480
这是计分
It's a league game, Smokey.

355
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,960
你不能这样做
You can't do that, man.

356
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,760
这些人和我一样 是和平主义者
These guys, you know, they're like me, they're pacifists.

357
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,430
烟仔是一个 拒绝兵役的人
Smokey was a conscientious objector.

358
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,330
酷哥 你知道我曾经 是和平主义者
You know, Dude, I myself dabbled in pacifism at one point.

359
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:36,700
当然不是在越南的时候
Not in Nam, of course.

360
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:40,270
你知道刚才这样他很难受
And you know he's got emotional problems, man.

361
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:42,770
超过了和平主义?
You mean, beyond pacifism?

362
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:45,470
他很脆弱 非常脆弱
He's fragile. He's very fragile.

363
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,150
我可不知道
I did not know that.

364
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:53,120
算了 覆水难收
Well, it's all water under the bridge.

365
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,190
我们一定要进入 下一次巡回赛
And we do enter the next round robin.

366
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,560
- 我有错吗? - 不 你没错
- Am I wrong? - No, you're not wrong.

367
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,390
- 我有错吗? - 你没错 沃尔特
- Am I wrong? - You're not wrong, Walter.

368
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,890
你只是个混蛋!
You're just an asshole.

369
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,390
那好吧
Okay then.

370
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,130
我们下周就要对 昆提那和奥布赖恩
Play Quintana and O'Brien next week.

371
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:07,030
他们应该很容易对付
They should be pushovers.

372
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,770
你能不能...
Man, would you just...

373
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,600
放轻松 伙计
Just take it easy, man.

374
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,970
那是你对所有 问题的回答 酷哥
You know, that's your answer for everything, Dude.

375
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,940
我要指出一点
Let me point out something. Pacifism is not...

376
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,850
看看现在伊拉克的情况
Look at our current situation with that camel fucker in Iraq.

377
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:22,880
和平主义不是 用来隐藏的
Pacifism is not something to hide behind.

378
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,250
放轻松 伙计
Just take it easy, man.

379
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,820
我非常冷静 酷哥
I'm perfectly calm, Dude.

380
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,360
挥舞着手枪也算是吗? 比你更冷静
Yeah, waving the fucking gun around? Calmer than you are.

381
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,260
你别那么冲动好吗?
Will you just take it easy?

382
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:35,890
比你更冷静
Calmer than you are.

383
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,970
酷哥 这是烟仔
Dude, this is Smokey.

384
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,970
我不想在这件 事情上搞僵了
Look, I don't wanna be a hard-on about this,

385
00:19:43,970 --> 00:19:45,300
我知道那不是你的错
and I know it wasn't your fault,

386
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,970
但我觉得应该告诉你
but I just thought it was fair to tell you

387
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,240
吉尔伯特和我会将 这个递交给赛会
that Gilbert and I will be submitting this to the league

388
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,540
并要求他们取消 这一轮的赛事
and asking them to set aside the round.

389
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,280
也许会将罚分记给我们
I don't know, maybe forfeit it to us.

390
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,620
我想只是一个警告
So, like I say, just thought, you know, fair warning.

391
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:59,180
告诉沃尔特
Tell Walter.

392
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,520
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,620

在计分的 时候出示枪械
drew a firearm during league play.

400
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,540
如果情况属实
If this is true, of course,

401
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,340
此行为违反了
it contravenes a number of the league's bylaws

402
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,040
计分的规则...
and also article 27 of the league...

403

413
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:12,490
把房租塞进我门口就行了

414
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:14,090

I hope you're not avoiding this call because of the rug,

418
00:21:25,470 --> 00:21:28,210
我可以保证 绝对不是问题

我们需要你的帮忙

420
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,980
我们非常想见到你 谢谢你 我是布兰特
Well, we would very much like to see you. Thank you. It's Brandt.

421
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,780
我们有个坏消息
We've had some terrible news.

422
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,980
李波斯基先生 将自己隔离在西边房
Mr. Lebowski's in seclusion in the west wing.

423
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,950
李波斯基先生
Mr. Lebowski.

424
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,190
真有意思
Funny.

425
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:59,300
回顾我一生的成就
I can look back on a life of achievement,

426
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,570
迎接过无数挑战
challenges met,

427
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,710
打败过无数对手
competitors bested,

428
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:05,440
克服过无数障碍
obstacles overcome.

429
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:10,480
我比大多数男人 有更多的成就
I've accomplished more than most men

430
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,780
而且没有使用到双脚
and without the use of my legs.

431
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,220
什么样可称为男人 李波斯基先生?
What makes a man, Mr. Lebowski?

432
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,930
叫我"酷哥"
Dude. Huh?

433
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,730
我不知道 先生
Oh, I don't know, sir.

434
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:30,600
做好准备 做正确的事情
Is it being prepared to do the right thing,

435
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,400
无论以何种代价?
whatever the cost?

436
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,370
但这样便可称为男人吗?
Isn't that what makes a man?

437
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,000
还要有一对睾丸
Sure, that and a pair of testicles.

438
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,380
真会开玩笑
You're joking,

439
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,350
但是 也许你是对的
but perhaps you're right.

440
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:49,250
介意我抽烟吗?
You mind if I do a Jay?

441
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,350
邦妮...
Bunny.

442
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,760
什么?
Excuse me?

443
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,650
邦妮 李波斯基
Bunny Lebowski.

444
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,890
她是我生命中的烛火
She is the light of my life.

445
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,960
你对我流泪感到惊讶吗?
Are you surprised at my tears, sir?

446
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,870
当然了
Oh, fucking A.

447
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,370
坚强的男人也会流泪
Strong men also cry.

448
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,980
坚强的男人也会流泪
Strong men also cry.

449
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:21,490
今天早上我收到这个传真
I received this fax this morning.

450
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:28,090
你可以看到 这是要求赎金的
As you can see, it is a ransom note.

451
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,200
"邦妮在我们手上"
"We have Bunny."

452
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,500
写自一些不敢 公平较量的人之手
Written by men who were unable to achieve on a level field of play.

453
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,270

"Gather $1 million..."

454
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,740
"没有记录的 不连续的20元纸币"
Cowards!"...in unmarked, nonconsecutive 20."

455
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:44,580
懦夫!"等待指示"
Weaklings!"Await instructions."

456
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,310
混混!"这不是开玩笑的"
Bums!"No funny stuff."

457
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,570
无赖
Bummer. Huh?

458
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:54,510
无赖 那是个无赖
This is a bummer, man. That's... That's a bummer.

459
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,020
布兰特会给你讲解细节
Brandt will fill you in on the details.

460
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,440
李波斯基先生将给 送赎金的人一份大方的报酬
Mr. Lebowski is prepared to make a generous offer to you to act as courier

461
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,080
现在我们只等他们的指示
once we get instructions for the money.

462
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,310
为什么找我?
Why me, man?

463
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:26,880
他相信那些 污染你地毯的人...和绑架的歹徒是一伙的
He believes the culprits might be the very people who soiled your rug

464
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,890
而你在此事中的 位置很特别
and you are in a unique position to confirm or disconfirm that suspicion.

465
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,760
他认为是那撒尿的 家伙干的?
He thinks the carpet pissers did this?

466
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,660
酷哥 我们就是不知道
Well, Dude, we just don't know.

467
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:16,220
"耶稣"

468
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,980

Welcome to the Hotel California

469
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,890

Such a lovely place

470
00:26:12,890 --> 00:26:14,760
该死的昆提那
Fucking Quintana.

471
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:18,160
那家伙很棒哦
That creep can roll, man.

472
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,160
没错 但他是个 变态 酷哥
Yeah, but he's a pervert, Dude. Yeah.

473
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:25,140
是啊 他是个有性侵犯 案底的家伙
No, he's a sex offender with a record.

474
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,210
在齐诺监狱坐了6个月 因为他对一个 8岁男孩露下体
He did six months in Chino for exposing himself to an eight-year-old.

475
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:31,580
他搬去好莱坞之后他还要挨家挨户地告诉别人
When he moved to Hollywood, he had to go door-to-door

476
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:33,340
他是个鸡奸者
to tell everyone he was a pederast.

477
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:37,810
- 鸡奸者是什么 沃尔特? - 闭嘴 唐尼
- What's a pederast, Walter? - Shut the fuck up, Donny.

478
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:42,820
他们给你多少钱?
So, how much did he give you?

479
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:46,220
两万 而且我还能得到那地毯
20 grand, man. And, of course, I still get to keep the rug.

480
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,620
就是那举手之劳? 是啊
Just for making a hand-off? Yeah.

481
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:49,990
他们还给了酷哥一个传呼机
They gave Dude a beeper.

482
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,900
如果那些人传呼...如果正在打比赛呢?
So whenever these guys call... What if it's during a game?

483
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:56,600
我告诉过他们如果 在比赛当中...
Oh, I told them if it was during league play...

484
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,800
什么比赛当中?
What's during league play?

485
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,340
地球不会为你停转
Life does not stop and start at your convenience,

486
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,340
你这个垃圾
you miserable piece of shit.

487
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,370
我想...沃尔特怎么了 酷哥?
I figure... What's wrong with Walter, Dude?

488
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,980
好赚 又无风险
I figure it's easy money, you know. It's all pretty harmless.

489
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,810
她有可能叫人绑架自己
She probably kidnapped herself.

490
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,750
什么意思 酷哥? 在地毯上撒尿的人不会做那些事情
What do you mean, Dude? Rug-peers did not do this.

491
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:17,690
看看 一个年轻女子为了钱嫁人
Look at it. A young trophy wife marries this guy for his money.

492
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,620
她觉得他没给她足够的钱
She figures he isn't giving her enough, you know.

493
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,460
而她在城里欠了一身债
She owes money all over town.

494
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,700
那个该死的婊子!
That fucking bitch!

495
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,560
这是个骗局
It's all a goddamn fake, man.

496
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,570
像列宁说的那样
It's like Lenin said,

497
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:33,640
找一个可以获得好处的人 你知道...
you look for the person who will benefit and, you know...

498
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,270
"我是海象 "(Beatles名曲)你会...
I Am the Walrus? You know, you'll...

499
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:39,010
你知道我想说什么的 我是海象
You know what I'm trying to say. I Am the Walrus.

500
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:41,880
那该死的婊子!是啊
That fucking bitch!Oh, yeah!

501
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,380
"我是海象"
I Am the Walrus. That's...

502
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,980
闭嘴 唐尼!
Shut the fuck up, Donny!

503
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:48,090
弗拉基米尔 伊里奇 列宁!
V.l. Lenin, Vladimir llyich Ulyanov!

504
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,350
他在说什么鬼话?
What the fuck is he talking about?

505
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,920
刚才的事让他发疯了
Fucking exactly what happened to those...That makes me fucking sick!

506
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,960
你在乎什么 沃尔特? 那些该死的有钱人
Well, what do you care, Walter? Those rich fucks.

507
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,000
这件该死的事情
This whole fucking thing.

508
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,830
当年我没能够亲见 好哥们在泥沼中死去
I did not watch my buddies die face down in the muck

509
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,670
那个该死的贱货
so that this fucking strumpet,

510
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,900
妓女...
this fucking whore, could waltz around...

511
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,400
我不觉得这与 越战有什么联系
I don't see any connection with Vietnam, man.

512
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,140
有文字上的联系
Well, there isn't a literal connection, Dude.

513
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:10,110
不 沃尔特 没有任何联系
No, Walter, face it, there isn't any connection.

514
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,680
到你了
Your roll. Have it your way.

515
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,110
到你了 但我要说的是
Your roll. But my point is...

516
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:15,880
- 我要说的是... - 你准备好被宰了吗?
- My point is... - Are you ready to be fucked, man?

517
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:20,350
我知道你们进了半决赛
I see you rolled your way into the semis.

518
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,790
我的天啊
Dios mfo, man.

519
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:26,660
里奥和我会将你们干掉的
Liam and me, we're gonna fuck you up.

520
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,930
是吗? 那就像是...你的一厢情愿 伙计
Yeah? Well, you know, that's just like your opinion, man.

521
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,300
我告诉你
Let me tell you something, pendejo.

522
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,600
你若敢对我们掏家伙
You pull any of your crazy shit with us,

523
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,510
你的肉就会飞到球道上
you flash a piece out on the lanes,

524
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:45,510
我会扣动扳机
I'll take it away from you and stick it up your ass

525
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:48,710
叫你屁眼开花...打到没子弹为止
and pull the fucking trigger till it goes click.

526
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,020
"耶稣"...
Jesus.

527
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:53,750
你说了 伙计
You said it, man.

528
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,980
没人可以斗得过耶稣
Nobody fucks with the Jesus.

529
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,690
记得那个8岁的小男孩吧 酷哥
Eight-year-olds, Dude.

530
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:30,050

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la

531
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,660

La-la-la, la, la, la, la

532
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,360

La-la-la, la, la, la, la

533
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,850

La-la-la, la, la, la, la

534
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,960

La-la, la-la

535
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,760

La-la-la

536
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,140

La-la-la, la-la-la

537
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:47,500

La-la, la-la

538
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,670

The man in me will do

539
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,250

Nearly any task

540
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,280

And as for compensation

541
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:02,420

There's little he would ask

542
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,520

Take a woman like you

543
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,720

To get through

544
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,250

To the man in me

545
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:17,430

Storm clouds are raging

546
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,500

All around my door

547
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,540

I think to myself

548
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:27,000

I might not take it anymore

549
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:30,710

Take a woman like your kind

550
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:35,180

To find the man in me

551
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,720

But, oh

552
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:42,790

What a wonderful feeling

553
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:47,300

Just to know

554
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:49,770

That you are near

555
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,240

Sets my heart a-reeling

556
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,410

From my toes

557
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,970

Up to my ears

558
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,220

The man in me will hide sometimes

559
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,790
他们80分钟前呼叫的
They called about? minutes ago.

560
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,490
他们想让你带钱去 开车到405公路北面
They want you to take the money, drive north on the 405.

561
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,920
40分钟后
They will call you on the portable phone

562
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,090
会有人打电话给你指示
with instructions in about 40 minutes.

563
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,260
只能有一个人
One person only.

564
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,800
他们说得很清楚 不然我就和你一起去了
They were very clear on that, or I'd go with you. One person only.

565
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,790
- 你的下巴怎么了? - 没什么
- What happened to yourjaw? - Oh, nothing, man.

566
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,960
钱在这里
Here's the money.

567
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,510
还有电话
And the phone.

568
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,440
酷哥 请你按照他们的指示
Please, Dude, follow whatever instructions they give.

569
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,310
好的 她的性命就在你手上
All right. Her life is in your hands.

570
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:36,010
别那样说
Man, don't say that.

571
00:31:36,010 --> 00:31:38,720
李波斯基先生要我重复的 她的性命就在你手上
Mr. Lebowski asked me to repeat that, her life is in your hands.

572
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,120
哦 妈的
Oh, shit, man.

573
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,550
她的性命就在你手上 酷哥
Her life is in your hands, Dude.

574
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,220
完事后马上报告
Report back to us as soon as it's done.

575
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,040
你在搞什么? 你拿着 我开车
Where the fuck are you going, man? Take the ringer, I'll drive.

576
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:01,340
- 拿什么? - 箱子
- The what? - The ringer.

577
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:02,970
调包计 酷哥
The ringer, Dude.

578
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,780
他们还没来电吗? 你怎么...
What the... Have they called yet?

579
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,650
这是什么?
What the hell is this?

580
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:17,620
我的脏内裤 酷哥 刚想拿去洗的
My dirty undies, Dude. The laundry. The whites.

581
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,830
沃尔特 你带着这些来 一定有什么原因
Walter, I'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies, man.

582
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,190
没错 酷哥 要那种重量
That's right, Dude. The weight.

583
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:24,590
那箱子不能空着
The ringer cannot look empty.

584
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,730
沃尔特 你想的是什么?
Walter, what the fuck are you thinking, man?

585
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:28,730
你说得对 酷哥 我应该想想...
You're right, Dude. I got to thinking.

586
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:31,670
为什么我们 只要那小小的两万
I got to thinking, why should we settle for a measly fucking 20 grand...

587
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:34,970
我们? 怎么是我们了? 你说你只是想跟我去的
We? What the fuck, "we"? You said you just wanted to come along.

588
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:37,440
酷哥 我说的是...我们手上拿着一百万的
My point, Dude, is why should we settle for 20 grand

589
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,180
时候为什么还想着那两万? 我错了吗?
when we can keep the entire million? Am I wrong?

590
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:43,350
是的 你错了 现在不是在玩游戏 伙计
Yes, you're wrong. This isn't a fucking game, man.

591
00:32:43,350 --> 00:32:45,750
但这就是个游戏 你自己说过的
Oh, but it is a game. You said so yourself.

592
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:48,050
她绑架了自己 我说我想是...
She kidnapped herself. I said I thought...

593
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,280
- 我是酷哥 - 谁?
- Dude, here. - Who is this?

594
00:32:57,700 --> 00:33:00,730
我是送赎金的人 你要我们怎么办?
Dude. The bagman, man. Where do you want us to go?

595
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,760
我们?
Us?

596
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,490
该死的!
Shit!

597
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,110
是的 我还有司机
Yeah, you know, me and the driver.

598
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:12,980
我不能一边拿着钱开车 一边讲电话...
I'm not handling the money, driving the car and talking on the phone all by my...

599
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,310
闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up!

600
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:17,300
酷哥 你搞砸了吗? 那是谁?
Dude, are you fucking this up? Who is that?

601
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:21,320
那是司机 我告诉过你...
That is the driver. I told you...

602
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,960
该死的!怎么了?
Oh, shit!What the fuck's going on?

603
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,420
沃尔特!怎么了?
Walter... What the fuck is going on?

604
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:30,860
他挂机了!你搞砸了!你搞砸了!
He hung up, man. You fucked it up. You fucked it up!

605
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,460
她的性命 在我们手上 伙计 别紧张 酷哥
Her life was in our hands, man. Easy, Dude.

606
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:37,430
我们什么也没做到 他们一定会杀了她
We're screwed now. We don't get shit. They're gonna kill her.

607
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,240
我们搞砸了 沃尔特 什么也没搞砸 酷哥
We're fucked, Walter. Nothing is fucked, Dude.

608
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,810
你现在非常不酷哥
Come on. You're being very un-Dude.

609
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:45,310
他们会再来电的 她绑架了...
They'll call back. Look, she kidnapped...

610
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,480
看到了吗? 什么也没搞砸 酷哥
You see? Nothing's fucked here, Dude.

611
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,450
什么也没搞砸 他们只是一帮业余的混蛋!
Nothing is fucked. They're a bunch of fucking amateurs.

612
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:55,050
沃尔特 先闭嘴好吗?
Walter, will you just shut the fuck up?

613
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:57,490
我在做正事的时候别捣乱
Don't say peep while I'm doing business here, man.

614
00:33:57,490 --> 00:33:59,460
好吧 酷哥
Okay, Dude. Have it your way.

615
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,990
他们只是业余的 操
But they're amateurs. Fuck.

616
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,830
酷哥
Dude.

617
00:34:06,830 --> 00:34:10,200
好了 我们继续 但不能再耍花样
Okay, we proceed but only if there is no funny stuff.

618
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:11,800
好的
Yeah, yeah.

619
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,970
不再耍花样 好了吗?
So no funny sturt Okay?

620
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,570
告诉我们该去哪里
Just tell me where the fuck you want us to go.

621
00:34:20,210 --> 00:34:22,480
那里有个标志
That was the sign, man.

622
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,280
我们要做的 就是带她回来
So, all we gotta do is get her back.

623
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,750
不能抱怨谁
No one's in a position to complain.

624
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:31,250
小费我们留着 好极了 沃尔特
We keep the baksheesh. Yeah, terrific, Walter.

625
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:33,990
但你还没告诉我 怎样带她回来 她在哪里?
But you haven't told me how we're gonna get her back. Where is she?

626
00:34:33,990 --> 00:34:35,930
那是很简单的 酷哥
That's the simple part, Dude.

627
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:40,190
我们去交换 让我把那个家伙打昏
We make the hand-off, I grab one of them and beat it out of him. Huh?

628
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:44,070
是啊 那是一个 很好的计划
That's a great plan, Walter.

629
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,270
沃尔特 你真是天才 如果我的理解是对的
That's fucking ingenious, if I understand it correctly.

630
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:48,310
这就像瑞士手表那样精确
It's a Swiss fucking watch.

631
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:51,510
没错 酷哥 简单即是美
That's right, Dude. The beauty of this is its simplicity.

632
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:54,840
一旦计划变得复杂 什么都会出错
Once a plan gets too complex, everything can go wrong.

633
00:34:54,850 --> 00:34:56,680
如果说我学到了什么...
If there's one thing I learned in Nam...

634
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,720
我是酷哥
Dude.

635
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,650
你们将要到达一座木桥
You are coming to wooden bridge.

636
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:04,890
过桥的时候...
When you cross the bridge,

637
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:08,290
不要停车 将箱子从 左边的窗户扔出去
you throw the bag from the left window of the moving car.

638
00:35:08,290 --> 00:35:09,430
你们正被监视
You're being watched.

639
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,060
该死的!他怎么说? 在哪里交换?
Fuck. What'd he say? Where's the hand-off?

640
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,830
现在没有交换了
There is no fucking hand-off, man.

641
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,600
我们要在那木桥上 将钱扔下去
At the wooden bridge we throw the money out of the car.

642
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,400
开着车将钱扔下去
We throw the money out of the moving car.

643
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,710
我们不能那样做 酷哥 那样会搞砸我们的计划
We can't do that, Dude. That fucks up our plan.

644
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,710
给他们电话 解释一下 沃尔特
Well, call them up and explain it to them, Walter.

645
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,040
你的计划太简单了
Your plan is so fucking simple,

646
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,910
我肯定他们会明白的
I'm sure they'll fucking understand it.

647
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:30,180
那就是它的美
That's the beauty of it.

648
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,650
木桥是吗? 我要把钱扔下去 沃尔特
Wooden bridge, huh? Throw them the money, Walter.

649
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,280
不能这样搞砸了
We're not fucking around, man.

650
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:36,620
酷哥 木桥就到了 快把调包的箱子给我
Okay, Dude, the bridge is coming up. Give me the ringer, chop-chop.

651
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,220
去你的 沃尔特 我爱你
Fuck that. Walter, I love you,

652
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,390
将来你迟早要面对那事实就是你是个该死的傻瓜
but sooner or later you're gonna have to face the fact you're a goddamn moron.

653
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,830
酷哥 没时间争论了
Okay, Dude. No time to argue. Hey, man!

654
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,260
那木桥 沃尔特!沃尔特!
Here's the bridge. Hey, Walter!Hey, Walter!

655
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,990
出去了!
Hey, Walter!Here goes the ringer!

656
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,570
怎么了? 酷哥 你开车
What the fuck? Okay, Dude, you're wheel.

657
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,840
时速保持15英里 我滚出去
Hey, man, what the fuck? At 15 mph, I roll out.

658
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
我回头将他们 其中一个收拾掉
I double back, grab one of them and beat it out of him.

659
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,110
- 乌兹冲锋枪 - 乌兹冲锋枪?!
- The Uzi. - Uzi.

660
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,310
你不会以为 我空手滚出去吧?
You didn't think I was rolling out of here naked, did you?

661
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:03,010
沃尔特 拜托 15英里 酷哥 来吧!
Walter, please!Fifteen, Dude!This is it!Let's take that hill!

662
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,280
沃尔特!
Walter!

663
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,910
在我们这里!
We have it!

664
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:32,510
在我们这里!
We have it!

665
00:36:32,510 --> 00:36:34,440
在...我们这里!
We have it!

666
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:51,090
好了 酷哥
Fuck it, Dude.

667
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,690
我们去打保龄吧
Let's go bowling.

668
00:37:31,170 --> 00:37:34,570
酷哥 像我前妻那样说 这不是我能控制的
Aitz chaim he, Dude, as the ex used to say.

669
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,440
那是什么鬼意思?
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

670
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,610
我们该怎样和 李波斯基说呢?
What the fuck are we gonna tell Lebowski?

671
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:41,810
他...
Oh, him.

672
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,880
问题到底是什么?
I don't know. What exactly is the problem?

673
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:49,850
问题是...你...
The problem is...What do you mean, what's the...

674
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,820
我们根本没有...
There was no...We didn't...

675
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:57,190
他们一定会杀了 那可怜的女人
They're gonna kill that poor woman, man!

676
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:59,130
你在说什么?
What the fuck are you talking about?

677
00:37:59,130 --> 00:38:01,730
那女人是个婊子绑架了自己
The poor woman, that poor slut kidnapped herself.

678
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,130
酷哥 你说过的
Come on, Dude. You said so yourself.

679
00:38:03,130 --> 00:38:05,500
我说可能她绑架了自己
Man, I said I thought she kidnapped herself.

680
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:07,070
只有你才那么肯定
You're the one who's so fucking certain.

681
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,710
没错 酷哥100%肯定
That's right, Dude. 100% certain.

682
00:38:09,710 --> 00:38:11,510
他们寄信要求下周比赛
They posted the next round for the tournament.

683
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,840
唐尼...我们的

周六? 那他们就要改期了
Saturday? Well, they'll have to reschedule.

686
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,180
沃尔特 我该怎么 和李波斯基说?
Walter, what am l gonna tell Lebowski?

687
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:22,590
我要和负责 安排赛事的混蛋说
I told that fuck down at the league office. Who's in charge of scheduling?

688
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:24,220
- 沃尔特 - 博克豪特
- Walter!- Burkhalter.

689
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:27,260
我跟他们说多少次了 我在安息日不打保龄
I told that kraut a fucking thousand times, I don't roll on shabbos!

690
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,660
他已经寄信了
Walter!They already posted it.

691
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,330
他可以撤回去!
Well, they can fucking un-post it!

692
00:38:30,330 --> 00:38:33,730
谁会在乎?!他们一定会杀了那可怜的女人
Who gives a shit? They're gonna kill that poor woman, man!

693
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,070
我该怎么和李波斯基说? 酷哥
What am I gonna tell Lebowski? Come on, Dude.

694
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:39,170
很显然她已经 厌倦了这个游戏 已经想回家了
Eventually she'll get tired of her little game and, you know, wander on back.

695
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,770
你为什么不能在 周六打保龄 沃尔特?
How come you don't roll on Saturday, Walter?

696
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,040
我要过安息日
I'm shomer shabbos.

697
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
那是什么 沃尔特? 同时...
What's that, Walter? Yeah, and in the meantime,

698
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,540
我该怎么和李波斯基说?
what do I tell Lebowski?

699
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:47,980
周六就是安息日
Saturday, Donny, is shabbos, the Jewish day of rest.

700
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:50,510
那就意味者我不工作
That means I don't work, I don't drive a car,

701
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:52,080
不开车...
I don't fucking ride in a car,

702
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,020
不能数钱...
I don't handle money, I don't turn on the oven

703
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,150
而且肯定不能打保龄!
and I sure as shit don't fucking roll!

704
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,220
天啊
Sheesh.

705
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,750
安息日!
Shomer shabbos!

706
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:04,490
沃尔特...安息日
Walter, how am I gonna... Shomer shabbos!

707
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,830
够了!我要走了 酷哥
Oh, fuck!That's it. I'm out of here. Oh, come on, Dude.

708
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:11,630
酷哥!酷哥!
Dude!Dude!

709
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,310
你就告诉他...
You just tell him...

710
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:17,770
我们把钱扔下去了 一切就像...
Tell him we made the drop and everything went, you know...

711
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,910
怎么了?
Oh, yeah. How'd it go?

712
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,880
没什么 酷哥车上有些宝贝
Went all right. Dude's car got a little dinged up.

713
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,350
沃尔特 我们没去交换人质
Walter, we didn't make the fucking hand-off, man!

714
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:25,480
他们没拿到钱!
They didn't get the fucking money!

715
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,820
他们一定会...
And they're gonna... They're gonna...

716
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,490
他们一定会杀了 那可怜的女人
They're gonna kill that poor woman.

717
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:31,250
他们一定会杀了 那可怜的女人
They're gonna kill that poor woman!

718
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,790
沃尔特 如果 你不能开车...
Walter, if you can't ride in a car,

719
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:34,260
你怎么去参加 安息日仪式?
then how do you get around on shabbos?

720
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,360
酷哥 你真的让我吃惊了
Really, Dude, you surprise me.

721
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,760
他们不会杀人的
They're not gonna kill shit.

722
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,960
他们一无是处
They're not gonna do shit.

723
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,660
- 他们能对她怎样? - 只是一帮乌合之众
- What can they do to her? - Bunch of fucking amateurs.

724
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:42,600
而且你看看
And meanwhile, look at the bottom line.

725
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,930
现在谁拿着那一百万呢?
Who's sitting on a million fucking dollars?

726
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,140
- 我说错了吗? - 沃尔特...
- Am I wrong? - Walter.

727
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:49,310
现在谁有一百万放在我们车子后面呢
Who's got a fucking million fucking dollars sitting in the trunk of our car?

728
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,410
我们的车 沃尔特? 他们呢? 只有我的脏内裤
Our car, Walter? And what do they got? My dirty undies.

729
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,040
那些白色内裤
My fucking whites!

730
00:40:00,150 --> 00:40:01,480
酷哥
Say, Dude?

731
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:04,390
你的车呢?
Where is your car?

732
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:07,620
- 谁拿了你的内裤 沃尔特? - 你的车呢 酷哥?
- Who's got your undies, Walter? - Where's your car, Dude?

733
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,720
你不知道吗 沃尔特?
You don't know, Walter?

734
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:14,120
停在残疾人专用区的 可能被拖走了
It was parked in a handicap zone. Perhaps they towed it.

735
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,830
你都知道它被偷了
You fucking know it's been stolen.

736
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,740
肯定有这个可能 酷哥
Well, certainly that's a possibility, Dude.

737
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,540
该死的
Oh, fuck it.

738
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:29,580
- 你去哪里 酷哥? - 我要回家 唐尼
- Where you going, Dude? - I'm going home, Donny.

739
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,740
- 电话在响啊 酷哥 - 谢谢提醒 唐尼
- Phone's ringing, Dude. - Thank you, Donny!

740
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,390
是的...
Yeah.

741
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:55,900
绿色 有些棕色的 锈迹
Green with some brown, rust coloration.

742
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:00,340
在车里有什么 值钱的东西吗?
And was there anything of value in the car?

743
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,780
有的
Oh, yeah.

744
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:07,520
一台录音机 一些磁带 还有...
A tape deck, some Creedence tapes, and there was a...

745
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,610
我的公文包
My briefcase.

746
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,850
在公文包里面呢?
In the briefcase?

747
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,160
文件
Papers.

748
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,460
只是文件
Just papers.

749
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:25,870
我的文件 生意文件
You know, my papers, business papers.

750
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,870
你做什么生意 先生? 我现在失业
And what do you do, sir? I'm unemployed.

751
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,250
我的地毯也被偷了
My rug was also stolen.

752
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:39,620
你的地毯在车上吗?
Your rug was in the car?

753
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,310
不 在这里被偷的
No. Here.

754
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,680
可另外立案了?
Separate incidents.

755
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,490
酷哥不在家
The Dude is not in.

756
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,360
你们经常找回那些失车吗?
Do you find them much, these stolen cars?

757
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:52,760
有时吧
Sometimes.

758
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:58,000
但别对那录音机有太大希望
Wouldn't hold out much hope for the tape deck though.Or the Creedence.

759
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,960
那么...
What about the briefcase?

760
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,010
我的公文包呢? 李波斯基先生 我想见你
Mr. Lebowski, I'd like to see you.

761
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:06,010
请回电 我会派车接你
Call when you get home and I'll send a car for you.

762
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:09,750
我叫玛迪 李波斯基 我就是拿走你地毯的人
My name is Maude Lebowski. I'm the one who took your rug.

763
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:12,810
看来那案子已经解决了
Well, guess we can close the file on that one.

764
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:07,340
请稍等 李波斯基先生
I'll be with you in a moment, Mr. Lebowski.

765
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:29,360
女性的形态让你觉得 不舒服吗 李波斯基先生?
Does the female form make you uncomfortable, Mr. Lebowski?

766
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:33,230
- 这就是那样的一幅画吗? - 在某种意义上 是的
- Is that what this is a picture of? - In a sense, yes.

767
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,170
我的艺术被认为与女性的阴道有关
My art has been commended as being strongly vaginal,which bothers some men.

768
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:40,100
这个词让某些 男人觉得不自在
The word itself makes some men uncomfortable.

769
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,770
- 阴道 - 是吗?
- Vagina. - Oh, yeah?

770
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:45,310
是的 他们不喜欢听到
Yes, they don't like hearing it and find it difficult to say,

771
00:43:45,310 --> 00:43:46,740
觉得难以启齿
whereas without batting an eye,

772
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:50,940
男人相对应的 就是他的阳具 或者叫...小弟弟
a man will refer to his dick, or his rod or his johnson.

773
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:53,320
小弟弟?
"Johnson"?

774
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:56,090
好了 李波斯基先生 我们说正事吧
All right, Mr. Lebowski, let's get down to cases.

775
00:43:56,090 --> 00:43:58,620
我父亲告诉我 他同意了给你那张地毯
My father told me he agreed to let you have the rug,

776
00:43:58,620 --> 00:44:02,690
但那曾经是我已故 母亲的一份礼物 所以他无权赠送给别人
but as it was a gift from me to my late mother, it was not his to give.

777
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:04,590
现在 你的脸上
Now, your face.

778
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:07,760
关于这次绑架...
As for this kidnapping.

779
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:12,470
没错 我知道此事 你的角色是送赎金的人
Yes, I know all about it, and I know that you acted as courier.

780
00:44:12,470 --> 00:44:15,810
让我告诉你 这件事简直让人恶心
Let me tell you something. The whole thing stinks to high heaven.

781
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:20,110
没错 但让我解释 一下地毯的事情
Yeah, right, but let me explain something about the rug.

782
00:44:20,110 --> 00:44:22,340
你喜欢性吗 李波斯基先生?
Do you like sex, Mr. Lebowski?

783
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:26,720
- 什么? - 性交 爱的身体行为
- Excuse me? - Sex, the physical act of love. Coitus.

784
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:30,020
你喜欢吗? 我刚在说我的地毯
Do you like it? I was talking about my rug.

785
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:32,620
你对性不感兴趣?
You're not interested in sex?

786
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:34,990
你说的是性交? 我也喜欢
You mean coitus? I like it, too.

787
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:37,360
这是关于男性对女权主义者的偏见认为我们讨厌性
It's a male myth about feminists that we hate sex.

788
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:39,860
这可以成为一种自然的 "性"致很高的产业
It can be a natural, zesty enterprise.

789
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,330
然而有某些人...
However, there are some people,

790
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:44,370
被称为色情狂
it is called satyriasis in men, nymphomania in women,

791
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:47,600
不能自控地参与而且 没有任何乐趣可言
who engage in it compulsively and without joy.

792
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:50,710
- 不是吧 - 是的 李波斯基先生
- Oh, no. - Oh, yes, Mr. Lebowski.

793
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:54,680
那些不幸的人不能去爱
These unfortunate souls cannot love, in the true sense of the word.

794
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:58,250
我们都认识的邦妮 就是其中之一
Our mutual acquaintance, Bunny, is one of these.

795
00:44:58,250 --> 00:45:00,550
玛迪
Listen, Maude,

796
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:03,820
如果你的继母是个性爱狂 我很抱歉
I'm sorry if your stepmother is a nympho,

797
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:07,290
但我觉得这个与我的...
but, you know, I don't see what this has to do with...

798
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,090
你有卡鲁哇酒吗? 看看这个吧 先生
You have any Kahlua? Take a look at this, sir.

799
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,460
我认识这男人
Oh, I know that guy.

800
00:45:17,070 --> 00:45:19,260
他是一个虚无主义者
He's a nihilist.

801
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,670
Karl Hungus啊
"Karl Hungus."

802
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,820
嗨
Hi. Hello.

803
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:40,860
总部说你这里的 线路有些问题
Mein dispatcher says there is something wrong with dein Kabel.

804
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,060
是的
Yeah. Come on in.

805
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,590
我不知道 出了什么问题
I'm not really sure exactly what's really wrong with the cable.

806
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:47,260
所以他们派我来 我是个专家
That's why they sent me. I am an expert.

807
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:48,630
电视机在这里
The TV's in here.

808
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:51,830
你一定能认出她
You recognize her, of course. Helga, bring my tools.

809
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:56,570
这是我的朋友莎莉
That's my friend Sherry.

810
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,340
她只是来洗澡的
She just came over to use the shower.

811
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:00,780
这故事非常无聊
The story is ludicrous.

812
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,810
我叫卡尔 维修工人
My name is Karl. Ich bin expert.

813
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:05,950
你一定是来修线路的
You must be here to fix the cable.

814
00:46:05,950 --> 00:46:08,890
之后的事情 你也应该想象到了
Lord, you can imagine where it goes from here.

815
00:46:08,890 --> 00:46:10,420
他修线路?
He fixes the cable?

816
00:46:10,420 --> 00:46:12,560
别装傻 杰弗里
Don't be fatuous, Jeffrey.

817
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,930
这女人从事色情行业 对我来说是无关痛痒的
Little matter to me that this woman chose to pursue a career in pornography,

818
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,660
更不用说他勾搭上了 杰奇.特里赫姆
nor that she has been banging Jackie Treehorn,

819
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:20,500
以我们这年头的话来说
to use the parlance of our times.

820
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,530
然而我是李波斯基 基金会的两个托管人之一
However, I am one of the two trustees of the Lebowski Foundation,

821
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,270
另外一个是我父亲
the other being my father.

822
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:28,340
我们的基金会领养了 一些年轻人...
The foundation takes youngsters from Watts and...

823
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,810
是啊 那些成就者
Shit, yeah. The achievers.

824
00:46:29,810 --> 00:46:33,580
没错 就是他们 我们对他们感到很骄傲
Little Lebowski Urban Achievers, yes, and proud we are of all of them.

825
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,510
我问父亲关于在基金户口的一百万提款的事情
I asked my father about his withdrawal of $1 million from the foundation account,

826
00:46:37,510 --> 00:46:39,420
他就告诉了我这个绑架
and he told me about this abduction,

827
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,150
但我认为这是荒谬无耻的
but I tell you it is preposterous.

828
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,120
那个私通者想骗取 我父亲的钱财
This compulsive fornicator is taking my father for the proverbial ride.

829
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,160
是的 但我的...我正想说到你的地毯
Yeah, but my... I'm getting to your rug.

830
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,960
我和父亲相处并不融洽
My father and l don't get along.

831
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,690
他不赞同我的生活风格
He doesn't approve of my lifestyle and,

832
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:52,430
不必说 我也不赞同他的
needless to say, I don't approve of his.

833
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:56,330
但我不想就他的 行为诉诸法律
However, I hardly wish to make my father's embezzlement a police matter.

834
00:46:56,330 --> 00:46:59,270
所以我建议 你向那些坏人...
So I'm proposing that you try to recover the money

835
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:01,500
要回那一笔钱
from the people you delivered it to.

836
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,470
我可以那样做的
Well, I could do that.

837
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,440
如果你成功做到了 我会将...
If you successfully do so,

838
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:11,780
收回数目的10% 作为你的赔偿
I will compensate you to the tune of 10% of the recovered sum.

839
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,880
十万...没错
A hundred... Thousand. Yes.

840
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:16,720
十万美金
Bones or clams or whatever you call them.

841
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:21,060
但是...我的...没错 还有你的地毯
Yeah, but what about my... Your rug, yes.

842
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,730
有了那笔钱你可以买到对我没有
Well, with that money you can buy any number of rugs

843
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:26,430
任何情感价值的地毯
that don't have sentimental value for me.

844
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:29,030
我还要对你下巴的 拳伤道歉
And I am sorry about that crack on the jaw.

845
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,570
那没什么...
Oh, that's fine. That doesn't even...

846
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,200
这是一位医生的名片他会为你服务的
Here's the name and number of a doctor who will look at it for you.

847
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,840
你不必付帐
You will receive no bill.

848
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,510
他是个彻头彻尾的好人
He's a good man and thorough.

849
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:39,210
你真体贴 不过...
That's thoughtful but...

850
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:42,700
请你去找他 他是个彻头彻尾的好人
Please see him, Jeffrey. He's a good man and thorough.

851
00:47:44,310 --> 00:47:46,480
那么...好吧
Oh, well, all right.

852
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,250
他说 我老婆总是给我麻烦
So he says, "My wife's a pain in the ass.

853
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,750
让我不得安宁
"She's always busting my frigging agates.

854
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,020
我女儿嫁了一个无用的丈夫
"My daughter's married to a loser bastard.

855
00:47:55,030 --> 00:47:58,990
我的屁股还长了皮疹 不能坐下来
"I got a rash so bad on my ass I can't even sit down.

856
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,260
但我不能抱怨什么
"But you know me, I can't complain."

857
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:03,130
没错
Oh, fucking A, man.

858
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,860
是啊
I got a rash, man. Fucking A.

859
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,570
我告诉你吧
I gotta tell you, Tone, man,

860
00:48:09,570 --> 00:48:12,780
以前的我总是觉得很沮丧
earlier today I was really feeling shitty, man.

861
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:14,780
无精打采
Really down in the dumps.

862
00:48:14,780 --> 00:48:16,250
失去了不少钱财...
Lost a little money...

863
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:19,750
别想那些了
Hey, you know what? Forget about it, huh? Forget about it.

864
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,080
算了吧
Yeah, fuck it, man.

865
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,990
没错 我不应该再担心那些事情 生活还要继续啊
You can't be worried about that shit. Life goes on, man.

866
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,680
到家了 先生
Well, home, sweet home, Mr. L.

867
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:31,790
看啊
Hey, yo. Come here.

868
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:34,290
你那位开大众汽车的 朋友是谁?
Who's your friend in the Volkswagen? Huh?

869
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:38,470
他跟随我们到这里的
Yeah. He followed us here.

870
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:41,470
他什么时候...啊!搞什么?
When did he start... Whoa!What the fuck?

871
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,670
进去里面 你这个混蛋
Get in the limo, you son of a bitch!No arguments!

872
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,540
小心点 我还拿着饮料
Hey!Hey!Careful, man!There's a beverage here!

873
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,750
开始说话 快点 你这个该死的混混
Start talking, and talk fast, you lousy bum.

874
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:52,680
我们在疯狂地找你 酷哥
We've been frantically trying to reach you, Dude.

875
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,210
我的钱在哪里?
Where is my goddamn money, you bum?

876
00:48:56,750 --> 00:48:59,560
我们...我...
Well, we... I don't...

877
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:01,920
他们没收到 笨蛋!
They did not receive the money, you nitwit!

878
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:03,630
他们没收到那笔钱!
They did not receive the money!

879
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:06,000
她的性命在你手上!
Her life was in your hands!

880
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,600
这是我们所关注的 酷哥
This is our concern, Dude.

881
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,730
现在没什么搞砸了
No, man. Nothing is fucked here.

882
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:11,730
- 没什么搞砸了? - 是的
- Nothing is fucked? - No, man.

883
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,640
飞机已经撞毁了!
The goddamn plane has crashed into the mountain!

884
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:19,940
听我说 你要相信 那些人还是相信...
Man, come on. Who are you gonna believe, those guys or...

885
00:49:19,940 --> 00:49:21,780
我们把钱扔下去了
We dropped off the damn money.

886
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,080
我们?
We?

887
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:27,450
我代表我们
I, the royal we.

888
00:49:27,450 --> 00:49:28,880
像那些社论一样
You know. The editorial...

889
00:49:28,890 --> 00:49:31,020
我按他们的 要求把钱扔下去
I dropped off the money exactly as per...

890
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:34,890
我得到的信息是很确切的
Look, man, I've got certain information. All right?

891
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:37,460
有些事情暴露了...
Certain things have come to light and...

892
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:40,160
你有没有想过...
You know, has it ever occurred to you

893
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:47,970
除了到处跑 还有责怪我...
that instead of, you know, running around, blaming me you know, given the nature of all this new shit,

894
00:49:47,970 --> 00:49:53,910
这事情会比想象 之中更加...负责吗?
you know, this could be a lot more complex...

895
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:58,950
这也许不是预料中 那么简单的 你知道吗?
I mean, it's not just... It might not be just such a simple... You know?

896
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,550
你究竟在说些什么?
What in God's holy name are you blathering about?

897
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:04,990
我在告诉你我要说的
Well, I'll tell you what I'm blathering about.

898
00:50:04,990 --> 00:50:07,020
我收到信息 伙计
I've got information, man.

899
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,860
有新的问题出现了
New shit has come to light.

900
00:50:08,860 --> 00:50:10,830
而且是...
And, shit, man,

901
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,700
她绑架了她自己
she kidnapped herself.

902
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:20,540
是啊
Well, sure, man. Look at it. You know?

903
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,570
一个放荡女子...我们是这样说的...
A young trophy wife, in the parlance of our times, you know.

904
00:50:24,570 --> 00:50:29,740
她在城里欠了很多债 还有那个色情电影制片人
She owes money all over town, including to known pornographers.

905
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,910
不过真的很酷
And that's cool. That's cool.

906
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,690
我要说的是她需要钱
I'm saying she needs money, man.

907
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:42,350
还有...他们肯定会说没拿到的
And, you know, of course they're gonna say they didn't get it

908
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,560
因为她想要更多
because she wants more, man.

909
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:49,000
她养了那么多白脸...
She's gotta feed the monkey. I mean...

910
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:54,500
不要说你从来没想过这些
Hasn't that ever occurred to you, man?

911
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,560
先生?
Sir?

912
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,210
没有 李波斯基先生 我从没想过
No, Mr. Lebowski, it had not occurred to me.

913
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:03,510
我们从没想过 酷哥
That had not occurred to us, Dude.

914
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,050
你知道...
Well, okay, you know?

915
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:09,650
新出现的麻烦和你们 并没有利害关系...
You guys aren't privy to all the new shit, so, you know...

916
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,120
但是...那是你们雇用我去做的
But, hey, that's what you... That's what you pay me for.

917
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:16,660
说到这个
Speaking of which,

918
00:51:16,660 --> 00:51:21,060
你们现在能否...将我的两万元兑现呢?
do you think that you could give me my $20,000 in cash?

919
00:51:21,060 --> 00:51:24,130
我本来要找我的 会计核对一下...
My concern is, and I've gotta check it with my accountant,

920
00:51:24,130 --> 00:51:26,940
但这样我必须 交很多税 所以...
that this might bump me up into a higher tax...

921
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,530
布兰特...把信封给他
Brandt, give him the envelope.

922
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:34,310
如果你们给现金那就最好
Oh, well, if you've already got the check made out, that's cool.

923
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:36,300
我们早上收到这个
We received this this morning.

924
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:42,320
你的使命没有完成
Since you have failed to achieve,

925
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:45,890
那是如此简单的任务
even in the modest task which was your charge,

926
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:49,160
既然你偷了我的钱
since you have stolen my money,

927
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:52,930
既然你背叛了 我的信任...
since you have unrepentantly betrayed my trust,

928
00:51:52,930 --> 00:51:56,970
我别无选择只能告诉你这个
I have no choice but to tell these bums

929
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:59,270
混混该做什么
to do whatever is necessary

930
00:51:59,270 --> 00:52:03,400
你要赔偿那笔钱 李波斯基
to recover their money from you, Jeffrey Lebowski.

931
00:52:04,670 --> 00:52:08,810
布兰特做我的证人我告诉你
And with Brandt as my witness, I will tell you this,

932
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:12,180
邦妮受到的伤害
any further harm visited upon Bunny

933
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:15,780
将10倍加于你头上
will be visited tenfold upon your head.

934
00:52:18,190 --> 00:52:19,620
哦 天啦
By God, sir,

935
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:29,260
我不能再接受另一只脚趾
I will not abide another toe.I hear the cottonwoods whispering above

936
00:52:29,270 --> 00:52:31,390
那不是她的脚趾 酷哥
That wasn't her toe, Dude.

937
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:36,270
那是谁的 沃尔特? 我怎么知道?
Whose toe was it, Walter? How the fuck should I know?

938
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:39,840
我知道的是没有 任何迹象表明...那指甲油 沃尔特
I do know that nothing about it indicates... The nail polish, Walter.

939
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,240
好了 酷哥
Fine, Dude.

940
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,210
那指甲油也可以 涂在其他人的脚趾上
As if it's impossible to get some nail polish, apply it to someone else's toe...

941
00:52:45,220 --> 00:52:46,580
其他人的?
Someone else... Pinking shears.

942
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,020
他们怎么可以...
Where the fuck are they gonna get...

943
00:52:48,020 --> 00:52:50,890
你要脚趾吗? 我可以找到
You want a toe? I can get you a toe.

944
00:52:50,890 --> 00:52:52,890
相信我吧 肯定 有办法的 酷哥
Believe me, there are ways, Dude.

945
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,220
你不会想知道的 今天下午3点前
You don't wanna know about it, believe me. Yeah, but, Walter...

946
00:52:55,230 --> 00:52:58,730
我就能给你一只脚趾 有指甲油的
Hell, I could get you a toe by 3:00 this afternoon with nail polish.

947
00:52:58,730 --> 00:53:00,730
那些该死的混蛋 沃尔特...
These fucking amateurs. Walter...

948
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:03,630
他们给我送来了一只脚趾 我们本应该很害怕的
They send us a toe, we're supposed to shit ourselves with fear.

949
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,300
天呐 沃尔特...
Jesus Christ!Walter...

950
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,470
问题是...他们会杀了她的 沃尔特
The point is... They're gonna kill her, Walter,

951
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,200
然后他们就要来杀我
and then they're gonna kill me.

952
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:11,670
酷哥 那...
Dude, that's...

953
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,210
那只是威胁的手段
That's just the stress talking, man.

954
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:20,350
这让我觉得...是一些对他人无害的犯罪
Now, so far we have what appears to me to be a series of victimless crimes.

955
00:53:20,350 --> 00:53:22,990
- 那脚趾呢?- 别说那脚趾了!
- What about the toe? - Forget about the fucking toe!

956
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:26,190
不好意思 你们可以小声一点吗?
Excuse me, sir. Could you please keep your voices down?

957
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:28,060
这是一间家庭餐厅
This is a family restaurant.

958
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:30,560
拜托了 告诉你 最高法院
Oh, please!Dear, for your information,

959
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,460
已经否决了这种限制!
the Supreme Court has roundly rejected prior restraint.

960
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,900
沃尔特 这和 第一修正案没关系
Come on. Walter, this is not a First Amendment thing, man.

961
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,170
如果你不冷静下来 我只能要求你离开
Sir, if you don't calm down, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

962
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:42,340
我当年打越战出生入死
Lady, I got buddies who died face down in the muck

963
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,140
为了你们这些闲人在这里开家庭餐厅!
so that you and I can enjoy this family restaurant!

964
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:48,540
- 好了 我要走了 - 酷哥 别走啊
- All right, I'm out of here. - Hey, Dude, don't go away, man.

965
00:53:48,550 --> 00:53:52,500
这事你我都有份 涉及到我们基本的自由!
Come on. This affects all of us, man!it's our basic freedoms!

966
00:53:57,290 --> 00:53:58,720
我不走
I'm staying.

967
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:02,920
我喝完我的咖啡
I'm finishing my coffee.

968
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:09,560
享受着咖啡
Enjoying my coffee.

969
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,050
酷哥不在
The Dude is not in.

970
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:30,990
请留言 谢谢

李波斯基先生 我是 洛杉矶警察局的罗探员
Mr. Lebowski, this is Duty O.e.Rolvaag of the LAPD.

我们找到了你的失车
We've recovered your automobile.

973

975
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,700
太好了!
Far out, man. Far fucking out!

976
00:54:54,080 --> 00:54:57,450
这是私人住宅啊
Hey!This is a private residence, man.

977
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,650
漂亮的土拨鼠
Oh, nice marmot.

978
00:55:17,430 --> 00:55:21,600
我们要那笔钱 李波斯基 我们要那笔钱 李波斯基
Where is the money, Lebowski? We wants the money, Lebowski!

979
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,810
你以为我们在开玩笑吗?
You think we are kidding or making with the funny stuff?

980
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,250
有些东西你还没梦想过 李波斯基
We could do things you haven't dreamed of, Lebowski.

981
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:37,250
我们什么也不相信 他什么也不相信 李波斯基
Ja, we believes in nothing. We believes in nothing, Lebowski. Nothing!

982
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:40,660
明天我们会回来将你的小弟弟切掉
And tomorrow we come back and we cut off yourjohnson.

983
00:55:40,660 --> 00:55:43,990
- 什么? - 我说我们要将你的 小弟弟切掉!
- Excuse me? - I said, we cut off yourjohnson!

984
00:55:43,990 --> 00:55:46,500
想想吧 李波斯基
Just think about that, Lebowski.

985
00:55:46,500 --> 00:55:48,500
就是你那鸡巴 李波斯基
Your wiggly penis, Lebowski.

986
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:50,830
也许我们可以 扯下来 李波斯基
Ja. Maybe we stomp on it and squish it.

987
00:55:59,810 --> 00:56:04,310
昨晚被人发现的停靠在桥墩底下
It was discovered last night in Van Nuys lodged against an abutment.

988
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:06,180
哪里?
Oh, man. Lodged where?

989
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,550
它没被撞散了架 已经算走运了 李波斯基先生
You're lucky she didn't get chopped, Mr. Lebowski.

990
00:56:08,550 --> 00:56:11,050
他们一定在到处兜风
Oh, man!Must've been a joyride situation.

991
00:56:11,050 --> 00:56:13,690
撞到挡土墙之后就遗弃了
They abandoned the vehicle once they hit the retaining wall.

992
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:17,130
我的公文包啊!不在里面!
Oh, my fucking briefcase, man!It's not here!Shit!

993
00:56:17,130 --> 00:56:18,890
我在报告上看到了 很抱歉
Yeah, I saw that on the report. Sorry.

994
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:20,920
你得从另一边进去
You gotta get in on the other side.

995
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:25,130
后镜在路上找到的就在车子旁边
The side view was found on the road by the car.

996
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:30,640
那录音机还在 已经算你走运了 还有那唱片
You're lucky they left the tape deck though, and the Creedence.

997
00:56:31,010 --> 00:56:33,710
天啊!什么气味?
Oh, Jesus!What's that smell, man?

998
00:56:33,710 --> 00:56:36,850
也许有个混混在上面睡过
Yeah. It's probably a vagrant slept in the car.

999
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:39,680
或者被人当作厕所使用
Or maybe just used it as a toilet and moved on.

1000
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:40,950
朋友...
Hey, man,

1001
00:56:42,250 --> 00:56:43,990
你一定能找到 那帮家伙
are you gonna find these guys?

1002
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:48,520
或者...总有一些线索...
Or, you know, I mean... You got any promising leads or...

1003
00:56:48,830 --> 00:56:50,460
线索?
Leads?

1004
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,130
当然有了
Yeah. Sure.

1005
00:56:52,130 --> 00:56:55,460
我会和罪案调查组的人说的
I'll just check with the boys down at the crime lab.

1006
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:59,370
他们有4个人 可以调查这案子
They got four more detectives working on the case.

1007
00:56:59,370 --> 00:57:01,000
我们只是来换班的
They got us working in shifts!

1008
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:07,640
线索!
Leads!

1009
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,950
我唯一的愿望就是在那帮 德国佬切掉我小弟弟之前
My only hope is that the big Lebowski kills me

1010
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:12,750
让那老李波斯基杀了我
before the Germans can cut my dick off.

1011
00:57:12,750 --> 00:57:13,980
线索!
Leads!

1012
00:57:13,980 --> 00:57:15,720
那太荒谬了 酷哥
Now, that is just ridiculous, Dude.

1013
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,550
没人会切掉你的小弟弟
No one's going to cut your dick off.

1014
00:57:17,550 --> 00:57:20,160
谢谢你 沃尔特 我没说什么
Thank you, Walter. Not if I have anything to say about it.

1015
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,290
谢谢 沃尔特
Thank you, Walter.

1016
00:57:21,290 --> 00:57:23,430
这让我觉得非常安全
That makes me feel very secure. Dude?

1017
00:57:23,430 --> 00:57:26,430
酷哥 让我内心非常温暖
That makes me feel very warm inside, man. Dude?

1018
00:57:26,430 --> 00:57:29,260
这件麻烦的事情
This whole fucking thing.

1019
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:32,600
我可以和那带着 尿迹的地毯留在这里
I could be sitting here with just pee stains on my rug.

1020
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,940
但我不会那样 该死的德国佬
But no, man, I got a, you know... Yeah. Fucking Germans.

1021
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:37,100
什么也没改变
Nothing changes.

1022
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:41,840
该死的纳粹 他们是纳粹吗 酷哥?
Fucking Nazis. They were Nazis, Dude?

1023
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:44,480
唐尼 他们以阉割作为恐吓
Oh, come on, Donny. They were threatening castration!

1024
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:46,420
我们要在 这里喋喋不休吗?
Uh-huh. Are we gonna split hairs here?

1025
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:47,820
不 我错了吗?
No. Am I wrong?

1026
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:51,220
他...他们是虚无主义者
Well, he didn't... Man, they were nihilists, man.

1027
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,860
他们一直说自己 什么也不相信
They kept saying they believed in nothing.

1028
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,190
虚无主义者
Nihilists.

1029
00:57:56,890 --> 00:57:58,190
该死的
Fuck me.

1030
00:57:59,900 --> 00:58:03,130
说说你对社会主义 有什么要求吧 酷哥
I mean, say what you want about the tenets of national socialism, Dude.

1031
00:58:03,130 --> 00:58:05,530
起码这是一种思潮
At least it's an ethos. Yeah.

1032
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,300
我们不要忘记...不要忘记 酷哥...
And, also, let's not forget... Let's not forget, Dude,

1033
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,340
收养野生动物 那两栖啮齿动物
that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent,

1034
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:16,740
在这城市里面...
for, you know, domestic Within the city...

1035
00:58:17,550 --> 00:58:20,680
是违反法律的 你现在成了 动物管理员了吗?
That ain't legal, either. What are you, a fucking park ranger now?

1036
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:22,350
不 我只是想...
No!I'm just trying to...

1037
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,220
谁在乎那该死的土拨鼠呢?
Who gives a shit about the fucking marmot?

1038
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:28,490
我们只是在表示同情 酷哥 该死的同情
We are sympathizing here, Dude. Fuck sympathy.

1039
00:58:28,490 --> 00:58:32,430
我不需要你们的同情 我要留着我的小弟弟
I don't need your fucking sympathy, man. I need my fucking johnson.

1040
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,670
你要来做什么呢 酷哥? 你要振作起来!
What do you need that for, Dude? You have got to buck up, man!

1041
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:39,570
你不能带着负面的 影响参加比赛
You cannot drag this negative energy into the tournament.

1042
00:58:39,570 --> 00:58:42,230
操那比赛 操你的 沃尔特
Fuck the tournament. Fuck you, Walter.

1043
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,010
操那比赛?
Fuck the tournament?

1044
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:50,110
酷哥 我明白你的心情
Okay, Dude. I can see you don't want to be cheered up here.

1045
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:52,580
唐尼 我们去打一轮吧
Come on, Donny. Let's go get us a lane.

1046
00:58:57,550 --> 00:59:00,220
再来一杯 好的 酷哥
Another Caucasian, Gary. Right, Dude.

1047
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:06,060

Friends like these, huh, Gary? That's right, Dude.

1048
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:18,730

See them tumbling down

1049
00:59:19,710 --> 00:59:24,910

Pledging their love to the ground

1050
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:29,990

Lonely, but free, I'll be found

1051
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:34,390
- 有好的撒尔沙酒吗? - 苏城的撒尔沙酒?
- You got a good sarsaparilla? - Sioux City Sarsaparilla?

1052

你好吗 酷哥?
How're you doing there, Dude?

1054
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:43,920
不是很好
Not too good, man.

1055
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,930
- 很不顺心是吧? - 是啊
- One of those days, huh? - Yeah.

1056
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:53,010
一个比我 贤明的人说过...
Well, a wiser fellow than myself once said,

1057
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:54,880
有时候你吃掉熊...
"Sometimes you eat the bear and..."

1058
00:59:56,310 --> 00:59:58,510
非常感谢
Much obliged.

1059
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:02,350
有时候...熊吃你
"Sometimes the bear, well, he eats you."

1060
01:00:04,050 --> 01:00:06,860
那是东方谚语吗?
That some kind of Eastern thing?

1061
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,290
很遥远的
Far from it.

1062
01:00:15,000 --> 01:00:16,990
我喜欢你的风格 酷哥
I like your style, Dude.

1063
01:00:18,270 --> 01:00:22,340
我也在钻研你的风格
Oh, well, I dig your style, too, man.

1064
01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:24,640
你的风格很牛仔
Got a whole cowboy thing going.

1065
01:00:29,050 --> 01:00:30,580
谢谢
Thank you.

1066
01:00:30,580 --> 01:00:32,580
还有一件事 酷哥
There's just one thing, Dude.

1067
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:34,420
什么?
What's that?

1068
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:37,050
你说话有必要带那么多脏字吗?
Do you have to use so many cuss words?

1069
01:00:40,460 --> 01:00:42,760
你他妈的在说什么?
What the fuck are you talking about?

1070
01:00:44,030 --> 01:00:46,500
好吧 酷哥 坚持你的方式
Okay, Dude. Have it your way.

1071
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,200
放轻松 酷哥
Take her easy, Dude.

1072
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,860
谢谢
Yeah. Thanks, man.

1073
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:00,600
你的电话 酷哥
Call for you, Dude.

1074
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:08,120
- 喂?- 杰弗里 你还没去看医生
- Hello? - Jeffrey, you have not gone to the doctor.

1075
01:01:08,120 --> 01:01:11,290
是啊 我还没去
Oh, yeah, no. No, I haven't yet.

1076
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:13,780
我想马上见你
I'd like to see you immediately.

1077
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:31,700
- 你就是李波斯基 - 是啊
- So, you're Lebowski. - Yeah.

1078
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:36,810
玛迪将你的事情都告诉我了
Maude has told me all about you.

1079
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:39,250
她很快就回来 请坐
She'll be back in a minute. Sit down.

1080
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,670
要喝点什么吗? 好的 白色俄罗斯
Do you want a drink? Yeah, sure. White Russian.

1081
01:01:43,650 --> 01:01:45,450
酒吧台在那边
The bar's over there.

1082
01:01:50,290 --> 01:01:54,430
- 你做什么的 李波斯基? - 你他妈的是什么人?
- So, what do you do, Lebowski? - Who the fuck are you, man?

1083
01:01:55,870 --> 01:01:59,800
玛迪的一个朋友 屁股裂开的朋友?
Just a friend of Maudie's. Yeah? The friend with the cleft asshole?

1084
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:05,510
- 你做什么的? - 没什么
- What do you do? - Oh, nothing much.

1085
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:08,640
- 你好 杰弗里 - 你好
- Hello, Jeffrey. - Hello.

1086
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,510
你好吗? 玛迪
Yeah. How are you? Listen, Maude.

1087
01:02:12,250 --> 01:02:13,810
我必须...
I got to

1088
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,520
向你请辞
tender my resignation or whatever

1089
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:23,590
因为...你母亲似乎...真的被绑架了
because looks like your mother really was kidnapped after all.

1090
01:02:23,590 --> 01:02:25,730
几乎可以肯定她不是
She most certainly was not.

1091
01:02:25,730 --> 01:02:30,870
你为什么 有时候不肯听些客观的意见?
Hey, man, why don't you fucking listen occasionally?

1092
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:33,570
你也许可以学到什么 现在...
You might learn something. Now, I got...

1093
01:02:33,570 --> 01:02:36,400
别称呼她为我母亲
Please don't call her my mother.

1094
01:02:36,410 --> 01:02:39,310
她是个罪犯而不是受害者
She's most definitely the perpetrator and not the victim.

1095
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:42,240
我得到了 非常确切的证据...
I'm telling you, I've got pretty definitive evidence.

1096
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:45,150
- 从谁那里得来? - 那个男人 奥利
- From who? - From the main guy, Uli.

1097
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:48,520
奥利? 她在色情电影里面的搭档?
Uli Kunkel? Her costar in the beaver picture?

1098
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:53,360
那电影...你认识那男人?
You mean vagina? I mean, you know the guy?

1099
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:56,260
我已经介绍过他
I might have introduced them, for all I know.

1100
01:02:56,260 --> 01:02:58,490
你记得奥利吗?
Do you remember Uli?

1101
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,360
他过去是个音乐家
He's a musician. Used to have a group, Autobahn.

1102
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:05,970
看看我的收藏 70年代后期 发行过一张唱片
Look in my LP's. They released one album in the late '70s.

1103
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:09,040
类似电子流行音乐
Their music is sort of a techno pop.

1104
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,510
- 他在假扮诱骗者? - 是的
- So he's pretending to be the abductor? - Well, yeah.

1105
01:03:12,510 --> 01:03:15,980
杰弗里 你也不会 绑架一个熟悉的人
Look, Jeffrey, you don't really kidnap someone you're acquainted with.

1106
01:03:15,980 --> 01:03:20,580
绑架就不能让人质在 释放后指认自己
The whole idea is that the hostage can't identify you after you've let them go.

1107
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:22,350
我知道
Well, I know that.

1108
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,190
那家伙到底在抽哪根筋? 他是谁?
What the fuck is with this guy? Who is he?

1109
01:03:29,190 --> 01:03:32,790
诺克斯 哈灵顿 录像艺术师
Knox Harrington, the video artist.

1110
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,700
那么钱在奥利那里?
So, Uli has the money.

1111
01:03:35,930 --> 01:03:39,460
其实不是
Well, no, not exactly.

1112
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,240
这个非常复杂 玛迪
This is a very complicated case, Maude.

1113
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,340
很多曲折
You know, a lot of ins, a lot of outs,

1114
01:03:44,340 --> 01:03:45,570
诸如此类的事物
a lot of what-have-yous

1115
01:03:45,570 --> 01:03:48,240
很多让我困惑的事情
and a lot of strands to keep in my head, man.

1116
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:50,780
很多酷哥困惑的事情
You know, a lot of strands in the old Duder's head.

1117
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:52,050
喂?
Hello?

1118
01:03:52,050 --> 01:03:54,020
如果钱不在奥利那里 那么会在谁手上?
If Uli doesn't have it, then who does?

1119
01:03:54,020 --> 01:03:56,020
是桑德拉
It's Sandra about the Biennale.

1120
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:59,620
我必须接听这个你还有那医生的电话吗?
Look. I have to take this. Do you still have that doctor's number?

1121
01:03:59,620 --> 01:04:03,260
其实瘀伤也已经退了 杰弗里
No, really, it's not even bruised anymore. Oh, please, Jeffrey.

1122
01:04:03,260 --> 01:04:06,430
我不想对任何后遗症负责
I don't want to be responsible for any delayed aftereffects.

1123
01:04:06,430 --> 01:04:07,850
[意大利语]

1124
01:04:08,860 --> 01:04:10,490
后遗症?
Aftereffects?

1125
01:04:10,820 --> 01:04:12,010
[意大利语]

1126
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:43,330
脱下你的短裤好吗 李波斯基先生?
Could you slide your shorts down, Mr. Lebowski, please?

1127
01:04:44,730 --> 01:04:46,800
不必了 她打在我这里
No, no, man. She hit me right here.

1128
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:50,470
我知道 脱下短裤好吗?
I understand. Could you slide your shorts down, please?

1129
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:03,950

Just got home from lllinois

1130
01:05:03,950 --> 01:05:06,220

Locked the front door, oh, boy

1131
01:05:06,220 --> 01:05:10,420

Got to sit down, take a rest on the porch

1132
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:13,060

Imagination sets in

1133
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:15,360

Pretty soon I'm singin'

1134
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,270

Doo, doo, doo

1135
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:19,430

Looking out my back door

1136
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:22,240

Keeping mighty cool. There's a giant doing cartwheels

1137
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:24,570

A statue wearing high heels

1138
01:05:24,570 --> 01:05:26,910

Look at all the happy creatures

1139
01:05:26,910 --> 01:05:29,240

Dancing on the lawn

1140
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:33,720

A dinosaur Victrola listening to Buck Owens

1141
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:35,780

Doo, doo, doo

1142

1151
01:06:22,030 --> 01:06:23,870

Bother me tomorrow

1152
01:06:23,870 --> 01:06:26,400

Today I'll buy no sorrows

1153
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,900

Doo, doo, doo

1154
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:30,700

Looking out my back door

He lives in North Hollywood on Radford, near the In-N-Out Burger.

1156
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:28,860
在那间IN&OUT汉堡包店附近
No, the In-N-Out Burger's on Camrose.

1157
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,370
那里的汉堡包 很好吃啊 沃尔特
Near the In-N-Out Burger. Those are good burgers, Walter.

1158
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:34,340

对我们很有启发
was truly a source of inspiration.

Oh, no, ma'am. We didn't want to give the impression that we were police, exactly.

1205
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,470
我们不希望报警
We're hoping it won't be necessary to call the police.

1206
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,010
但这取决于小拉里
But that's up to little Larry here.

1207
01:10:27,010 --> 01:10:28,640
对吗 拉里?
Isn't it, Larry?

1208
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:41,650
这是你的作业吗 拉里?
Is this your homework, Larry?

1209
01:10:43,090 --> 01:10:45,390
这是你的作业吗 拉里?
Is this your homework, Larry? Look, man, it...

1210
01:10:45,390 --> 01:10:48,860
酷哥 这是你的作业吗 拉里?
Dude. Please? Is this your homework, Larry?

1211
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:50,330
问他关于车子的事情
Just ask him about the car, man.

1212
01:10:50,330 --> 01:10:52,730
这是你的吗? 这是你的作业吗 拉里?
Is this yours, Larry? Is this your homework, Larry?

1213
01:10:52,740 --> 01:10:54,000
外面的车是你的吗?
Is that your car out front?

1214
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:57,040
这是你的作业吗 拉里? 我们知道这是他的作业!
Is this your homework, Larry? We know it's his fucking homework!

1215
01:10:57,040 --> 01:10:59,370
钱在哪里 你这个臭小子?
Where's the fucking money, you little brat?

1216
01:10:59,370 --> 01:11:02,510
拉里...你听说过越战的事情吗?
Look, Larry, have you ever heard of Vietnam?

1217
01:11:02,510 --> 01:11:04,880
你真让人头痛 我们知道这是你的作业
For Christ's sake, Walter. You are entering a world of pain, son.

1218
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:07,650
你偷了我们的车
We know that this is your homework. We know that you stole the car.

1219
01:11:07,650 --> 01:11:10,250
还有那些钱!还有那些钱!
And the fucking money. And the fucking money!

1220
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,020
我们知道这是你的作业
And we know that this is your homework!

1221
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:13,320
我们要切掉你的小弟弟 拉里
We're gonna cut your dick off, Larry.

1222
01:11:13,320 --> 01:11:15,290
你快要了你爸爸的命了
You're killing your father, Larry.

1223
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:20,550
好了 这是没意义的
All right. This is pointless.

1224
01:11:21,860 --> 01:11:24,530
该用B计划了
Okay, time for Plan B.

1225
01:11:26,770 --> 01:11:29,740
你也许想看看外面 拉里
You might want to watch out that front window, Larry.

1226
01:11:31,010 --> 01:11:34,410
这就是惹怒陌生人的后果!
Son, this is what happens when you fuck a stranger in the ass!

1227
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,110
用语言讲不通是吧
A little language problem here.

1228
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:40,480
那臭小子惹我发火
Little prick's stonewalling me.

1229
01:11:41,350 --> 01:11:42,910
沃尔特!
Walter.

1230
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,610
你在干什么?
What are you doing, man?

1231
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:50,050
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

1232
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,130
看吧 拉里
Here you go, Larry.

1233
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:55,200
看到了吗?
You see what happens?

1234

这就是后果!
This is what happens when you fuck a stranger...

1248
01:12:32,970 --> 01:12:35,770
你在干什么? 住手!
What the fuck are you doing, man? Stop it!

1249
01:12:35,770 --> 01:12:38,340
我上周才买到这辆车的!
Hey, man. I just bought that fucking car last week!

1250
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:41,480

我要砸了你的车!
I'll kill your fucking car, man!

1253
01:12:46,620 --> 01:12:48,720
那不是他的车啊!

1256
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:55,720
你喜欢吗? 去你的!

我要砸了你的车!

1262
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,960
那与此事无关
That has nothing to do with it.

1263
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:38,730
是的 车子熬到回家 你在家里打电话给我
Yes, the car made it home. You're calling me at home.

1264
01:13:40,370 --> 01:13:45,100
不 沃尔特 看起来不是的...拉里不会说出什么
No, Walter, it did not look like Larry was about to crack!

1265
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:49,330
那是你的猜测
Well, that's your perception.

1266
01:13:51,050 --> 01:13:53,780
沃尔特 你说得对
You know, Walter, you're right.

1267
01:13:53,780 --> 01:13:55,820
有一句话我还没说
There is an unspoken message here.

1268
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:58,250
就是"去你的"!别管我了!
It's, "Fuck you!Leave me the fuck alone!"

1269
01:14:01,190 --> 01:14:03,020
没错 我会去练习的
Yeah, I'll be at practice.

1270

戴上你的尿布 李波斯基

Jackie Treehorn wants to see the deadbeat Lebowski.

1274

Which one's Logjammin'? Yes, regrettably, it's true.

1284

成人娱乐被加上了标准
Standards have fallen in adult entertainment.

1285

1286
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:58,910
既然我们要和那些 业余的家伙竞争
Now that we're competing with those amateurs,

1287
01:15:58,910 --> 01:16:02,430
我们可以投资一些 有情节的故事 加大生产量
we can't afford to invest in little extras like story,

1288
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:06,210
加入感情

1289
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:13,180
人们忘记了...大脑是最大的情欲地带
You know, people forget that the brain is the biggest erogenous zone.

1290
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,490
也许在你身上是的
On you maybe.

1291
01:16:15,490 --> 01:16:17,490
当然有利也有弊
Of course, you have to take the good with the bad.

可以用新的技术 做一些刺激的事情
New technology permits us to do very exciting things

1293
01:16:20,460 --> 01:16:23,260
那些交互式的色情软件

1296
01:16:33,610 --> 01:16:38,080
当然了 我知道你很迫不及待
Of course you do. I can see you're anxious for me to get to the point.

1297
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,880
我们开门见山 酷哥
Well, here it is, Dude.

1298
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:42,520
邦妮在哪里?
Where's Bunny?

1299
01:16:42,520 --> 01:16:45,190
- 我还以为你知道呢 - 我怎么会知道?
- Well, I thought you might know that, man. - Why would l?

1300
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:49,520
她为了那一笔数目不小的 债而从我这里逃跑了
She only ran off to get away from that rather sizable debt to me.

1301
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:51,990
不 她没逃跑 只是...
No, she didn't run off. She's been...

1302
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:54,200
那绑架的故事 我听说了 省下吧
I heard that kidnapping story, so save it.

1303
01:16:54,200 --> 01:16:56,190
我知道你被夹在中间 酷哥
I know you're mixed up in all this, Dude.

1304
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:01,000
我也不在乎你想从 他丈夫那里得到什么好处
And I don't care what you're trying to get from the husband.

1305
01:17:01,000 --> 01:17:02,600
那是你的事情
That's your business.

1306
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,510
我要说的是我要我的东西
All I'm saying is I want mine.

1307
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:07,840
是啊
Yeah, right, man.

1308
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:11,850
有很多方面
I mean, there are a lot of facets to this,

1309
01:17:11,850 --> 01:17:13,750
很多部分...
a lot of interested parties.

1310
01:17:14,150 --> 01:17:15,480
不好意思
Excuse me.

1311
01:17:21,190 --> 01:17:22,280

1312

01:17:29,560 --> 01:17:31,660
好了
All right. Yeah.

1315
01:17:34,670 --> 01:17:36,000
不好意思
Excuse me.

1316
01:18:11,510 --> 01:18:15,240
- 原谅我 - 没问题
- Forgive me. - No problemo, man.

1317
01:18:15,240 --> 01:18:19,610
如果我找到你的钱...
So, if I can find your money,

1318
01:18:21,380 --> 01:18:23,350
对我有什么好处?
what's in it for the Dude?

1319
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:26,590
那当然是可以商量的 再来一杯吗?
Well, of course, there's that to discuss. You want a refill?

1320
01:18:26,590 --> 01:18:30,160

I dig the way you do business, man.

Your money is being held by a kid named Larry Sellers.

1328
01:18:54,820 --> 01:18:56,750
该死的学生
Flunking social studies.

1329
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:03,090
如果你可以...
So, if you could just

1330

5 grand, I'll go out and mingle.

1332

No funny stuff, Jackie. The kid's got it.

1337

那小子想要一辆车
Kid just wanted a car.

1338
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:43,030
酷哥只想要回他的地毯
All the Dude ever wanted was his rug back.

1339
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:44,860
我并不贪心
Not greedy.

1340
01:19:46,500 --> 01:19:47,900
它真的...
It really

1341
01:19:49,540 --> 01:19:51,230
跟我屋很搭调
tied the room together.

1342
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:57,440
酷哥接受了黑暗的洗礼
Darkness washed over the Dude.

1343
01:19:57,450 --> 01:20:01,940
就像在没有月亮的 晚上在海上航行
Darker than a black steer's tokus on a moonless prairie night.

1344
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:05,680
进入一个无底洞
There was no bottom.

Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

What condition my condition was in

1351
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:33,250

I woke up this morning with the sundown shining in

1352
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:41,590

I found my mind in a brown paper bag within

1353
01:20:44,460 --> 01:20:48,800

I tripped on a cloud and fell-a eight miles high

1354
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:52,930

I tore my mind on a jagged sky

1355
01:20:52,930 --> 01:20:54,740

I just dropped in

1356
01:20:54,740 --> 01:20:58,930

To see what condition my condition was in

1357
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:02,040

Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

1358
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,340

What condition my condition was in

1359
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:15,290

I pushed my soul in a deep, dark hole

1360
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:17,950

And then I followed it in

1361
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:23,060

I watched myself crawlin' out

1362
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:26,930

As I was a-crawlin' in

1363
01:21:27,570 --> 01:21:30,140

I got up so tight

1364
01:21:30,140 --> 01:21:32,340

I couldn't unwind

1365
01:21:32,340 --> 01:21:36,540

I saw so much I broke my mind

1366
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,480

I just dropped in

1367
01:21:38,480 --> 01:21:42,180

To see what condition my condition was in

1368
01:21:51,130 --> 01:21:53,830

Yeah, yeah, oh, yeah

1369
01:21:53,830 --> 01:21:57,060

What condition my condition was in

1370
01:22:02,940 --> 01:22:06,840

Someone painted "April Fool"

1371
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:09,440

In big, black letters on a "Dead End" sign

1372
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:15,550

I had my foot on the gas as I left the road

1373
01:22:15,550 --> 01:22:19,110

And blew out my mind

1374
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:24,120

Eight miles out of Memphis and I got no spare

1375
01:22:24,130 --> 01:22:28,030

Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere

1376
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:30,330

I just dropped in

1377
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:34,670

To see what condition my condition was in

1378
01:22:36,100 --> 01:22:38,510

I said I just dropped in

1379
01:22:38,510 --> 01:22:42,670

To see what condition my condition was in

1380
01:22:43,080 --> 01:22:46,250

Yeah, yeah

1381
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:52,520

O? yeah

1382
01:23:46,710 --> 01:23:50,110

He was innocent

1383
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:54,680

Not a charge was true

1384
01:23:55,380 --> 01:24:00,950

And they say he ran away branded

1385
01:24:14,340 --> 01:24:16,170
这是你唯一的身份证明?
Is this your only ID?

1386
01:24:16,970 --> 01:24:18,870
我知道我的权力
I know my rights, man.

1387
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:22,840
你什么也不知道 李波斯基
You don't know shit, Lebowski.

1388
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,610
我要一个律师
I want a fucking lawyer, man.

1389
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:29,780
我要...比尔 克斯勒
I want Bill Kunstler, man,

1390
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:33,090
或者朗恩 库奇
or Ron Kuby.

1391
01:24:33,090 --> 01:24:36,360
特里赫姆先生告诉我们...
Mr. Treehorn tells us that he had to eject you

1392
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:38,350
他将你从派对里赶出去
from his garden party,

1393
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:40,790
你喝醉了 并失去控制
that you were drunk and abusive.

1394
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:45,890
特里赫姆先生把什么事都看做女人
Mr. Treehorn treats objects like women, man.

1395

特里赫姆先生 对这城市的贡献很大
Mr. Treehorn draws a lot of water in this town.

1396
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,070
但你什么贡献也没有 李波斯基
You don't draw shit, Lebowski.

1397
01:24:52,070 --> 01:24:54,880
这是个 宁静的海滩社区
Now, we got a nice quiet little beach community here,

1398
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:57,480
而我要保证它的宁静
and I aim to keep it nice and quiet.

1399
01:24:57,480 --> 01:24:59,810
我说明白一点
So let me make something plain.

1400
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:04,440
我不喜欢你在这里搞事 骚扰这里的市民 李波斯基
I don't like you sucking around bothering our citizens, Lebowski.

1401
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:07,490
我不喜欢你的鸟名字
I don't like your jerk-off name.

1402

不喜欢你的鸟脸

1404
01:25:10,560 --> 01:25:13,490
我不喜欢你...怪胎
And I don't like you, jerk-off.

1405
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:19,070
听明白了吗?
Do I make myself clear?

1406
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:24,170
对不起 我刚才没在听
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.

1407
01:25:26,810 --> 01:25:28,400
该死的法西斯!
Fucking fascist!

1408
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:32,210
远离马里布 李波斯基!

Keep your ugly, fucking, gold-bricking ass out of my beach community.

1411
01:25:40,990 --> 01:25:43,760

I want to sleep with you

1412
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:46,890

In the desert tonight

1413
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:52,760

With a billion stars all around

1414
01:25:53,640 --> 01:25:56,900
天啊...换个频道好吗?
Jesus, man. Could you change the channel?

1415
01:25:56,900 --> 01:25:58,640
去你妈的!如果你 不喜欢我的音乐
Fuck you, man!If you don't like my fucking music,

1416

就别坐我的车!
get your own fucking cab!

1417
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,380
我真的...
I had a really rough...

1418
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:03,240
我要将你踢出去
I'll pull off to the side and kick your ass out.

1419
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:07,940
我今晚真的很倒霉啊 我讨厌老鹰乐队
Man, come on. I had a rough night, and I hate the fucking Eagles, man.

1420
01:26:15,690 --> 01:26:18,280
滚出去!出去!
Out of my fucking cab!Out!Man!

1421
01:26:19,730 --> 01:26:21,920
嗨!嗨!
Man!Man!Hey!

1422
01:26:33,110 --> 01:26:37,110

There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there

1423
01:26:37,110 --> 01:26:40,910

And they're all livin' devil may care

1424
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:44,510

And I'm just the devil with love to spare

1425
01:26:44,750 --> 01:26:48,050

我曾经是休伦湖港口 声明的创作者之一

1436

1437
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:04,300
你听说过西雅图七侠团体吗?
You ever hear of the Seattle Seven?

还有另外6个人...

1440

后来做了一段时间音乐经理人
And then the music business, briefly.

1441

01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:30,620
然后 做些这个 做些那个

1446
01:28:31,990 --> 01:28:35,330
我的事业最近停滞了
My career's slowed down a little lately.

1447
01:28:35,330 --> 01:28:38,460
你有什么消遣?
What do you do for recreation?

1448
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:40,800

你的屋子怎么了?
What happened to your house?

1452
01:28:55,780 --> 01:28:58,420
杰奇 特里赫姆 将这里翻了一遍

He got me out of the way while he looked for it.

1455
01:29:04,660 --> 01:29:06,860
- 要鸡尾酒吗? - 不了 谢谢
- Cocktail? - No, thanks.

1456
01:29:06,860 --> 01:29:09,960
那不是我父亲的钱 是基金会的
It's not my father's money. It's the foundation's.

1457
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,830
为什么他觉得你有呢? 谁知道呢?
Why did he think you have it? Who does?

1458
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:18,370
那个中学生拉里 真是个该死的臭小子
Oh, Larry Sellers, this high school kid. Real fucking brat.

1459

You know, this is a very complicated case, Maude.

1460
01:29:22,010 --> 01:29:24,000
很多曲折
A lot of ins, a lot of outs.

1461
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:29,320
不幸的是 我得坚持一个 很严格的...
You know, fortunately, I'm adhering to a pretty strict, drug regimen

1462
01:29:29,320 --> 01:29:31,650
用药规则 不让自己放纵 你知道的
to keep my mind, you know, limber,

1463
01:29:31,650 --> 01:29:35,290
已经非常接近 你父亲的钱了
and I'm very fucking close to your father's money.

1464
01:29:35,290 --> 01:29:37,990
我一直在说那是 基金会的钱
I keep telling you, it's the foundation's money.

1465
01:29:37,990 --> 01:29:39,620
我父亲没钱的
Father doesn't have any.

1466
01:29:41,200 --> 01:29:43,460
你说什么? 他很富有啊

不 他是管理者...
No, he runs stuff.

1469
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,740
我们的确让他管理 其中一间公司
We did let him run one of the companies briefly,

1470
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:53,740
但他做得很不好 不 你知道的
but he didn't do very well at it. Oh, he's, you know...

1471
01:29:53,740 --> 01:29:56,210
他现在帮助管理 一个慈善机构
No, he helps administer the charities now,

1472
01:29:56,210 --> 01:29:58,910
而我给他相应的养老金

1473
01:29:58,910 --> 01:30:00,680
他自己没钱的
He has no money of his own.

1474
01:30:00,680 --> 01:30:02,450
我知道他介绍自己的方式
I know how he likes to present himself.

1475
01:30:02,450 --> 01:30:05,750
他的缺点就是虚荣 于是 那个婊子...
Father's weakness is vanity, hence the slut.

1476
01:30:08,020 --> 01:30:09,620
你认为他...
Do you think he...

1477
01:30:11,160 --> 01:30:12,560

我是说 既然他知道 我什么也做不了
I'm saying that if he knows I'm a fuckup,

为什么要我去找她老婆回来?
why does he leave me in charge of getting his wife back?

因为他不想她回来
Because he doesn't fucking want her back, man.

Okay, but then why doesn't he give a shit about his million bucks?

1572
01:35:17,970 --> 01:35:20,830
他知道我们不会把 那一百万交给绑匪
I mean, he knows we never handed off his briefcase,

1573
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:22,900
但他从没要求拿回来

1574
01:35:22,900 --> 01:35:26,000
那箱子里面根本 没有一百万

那箱子是空的

那混蛋想他们杀了她

1578
01:35:35,180 --> 01:35:38,990
但为什么要那么急呢?

我知道你在说什么 酷哥 他留着那笔钱
I'm saying, I see what you're getting at, Dude. He kept the money.

1586
01:35:59,270 --> 01:36:00,970
你在说什么?
What the fuck are you talking about?

1587

5年前你们就离婚了
And five fucking years ago, you were divorced.

1590
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,180
那你觉得应该怎样? 你离婚之后
So what are you saying? When you get divorced,

1591
01:36:09,180 --> 01:36:11,420
你就可改变信仰了? 不做犹太人了?
you turn in your library card? You get a new license?

1592
01:36:11,420 --> 01:36:14,590
这是公路吗?
You stop being Jewish? This is the driveway.

1593
01:36:14,590 --> 01:36:16,690
我是一个犹太人
Jewish as fucking Tevye. Man.

1594
01:36:16,690 --> 01:36:21,060
这都是因为辛迪雅 而产生的病态
You know, it's all a part of your sick Cynthia thing.

1595
01:36:21,060 --> 01:36:25,030
照顾她留下的小狗...去那些犹太人集会...
Man, taking care of her fucking dog, going to her fucking synagogue.

1596
01:36:25,030 --> 01:36:26,970
你还活在你的过去
You're living in the fucking past.

1597
01:36:26,970 --> 01:36:30,400
那是有3000年 历史的传统
Three thousand years of beautiful tradition, from Moses to Sandy Koufax.

她刚离开的没告诉我们
She just picked up and left, never bothered to tell us.

1607
01:37:03,970 --> 01:37:06,540
我想那该死的虚无 主义者知道她在哪里
Well, I guess the fucking nihilists knew where she was.

1608
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:08,840
酷哥 她没绑架自己
Jesus, Dude. She never even kidnapped herself.

1609
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:12,280
这位是谁 酷哥? 我是个退伍军人
Who is this gentleman, Dude? Who am l? I'm a fucking veteran.

1610
01:37:12,280 --> 01:37:13,580
我是个退伍军人
Come on!That's who I am.

1611
01:37:13,580 --> 01:37:16,110
他不应该来这里的 酷哥 李先生现在非常生气
You shouldn't go in there, Dude. He's very angry.

1612
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:19,890
你好
So, man.

1613
01:37:19,890 --> 01:37:23,790
她回来了 但不是因为你们
So? She's back, no thanks to you.

1614
01:37:23,790 --> 01:37:26,260
钱在哪里 李波斯基?
Where's the fucking money, Lebowski?

1615
01:37:26,260 --> 01:37:29,660
从那基金会提出来的一百万!
A million bucks from fucking, needy, little Urban Achievers!

1616
01:37:29,660 --> 01:37:31,230
你是个人渣!
You are scum, man!

1617
01:37:31,230 --> 01:37:33,600
他到底是谁? 我是谁?
Who the hell is he? Who am I? Who am I?

1618
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,270
我是一个非常讨厌
Walter. I'm the guy that's gonna kick your phony,

1619
01:37:35,270 --> 01:37:36,670
你那些诡计的人
gold-bricking ass, that's who I am. Man.

1620
01:37:36,670 --> 01:37:38,600
他知道那箱子是空的
We know the briefcase was fucking empty.

1621
01:37:38,610 --> 01:37:40,710
我们知道你自己 留下了那一百万
We know you kept the million bucks for yourself.

1622
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:42,380
你们有你的故事 我有我的故事
You have your story, I have mine.

1623
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:45,750
我说我把钱委托给你们了 而你们偷走了
I say I entrusted the money to you and you stole it.

1624
01:37:45,750 --> 01:37:49,050
如果我们想过的话 你那些该死的钱!
As if we would ever dream of taking your bullshit money!

1625
01:37:49,050 --> 01:37:51,350
你以为邦妮被绑架了
You thought that Bunny had been kidnapped,

1626
01:37:51,350 --> 01:37:53,020
而你很高兴
and you were fucking glad, man.

1627
01:37:53,020 --> 01:37:55,360
可以用作让钱消失的借口
You could use it as an excuse to make some money disappear.

1628
01:37:55,360 --> 01:37:58,730
你需要的只是 一个傻子做你的替罪羊
All you needed was a sap to pin it on. You just met me.

1629
01:37:58,730 --> 01:38:01,730
你这个人渣!
You... You human paraquat.

1630
01:38:01,730 --> 01:38:05,300
这里有一个失败者
You figured, "Oh, here's a loser, you know, a deadbeat.

1631
01:38:05,300 --> 01:38:07,970
一个没人理会的家伙
"Somebody this square community won't give a shit about."

1632
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:09,530
你不是吗?
Well, aren't you?

1633
01:38:10,800 --> 01:38:14,610
我是 不过...你们都出去
Well, yeah, but... Get out, both of you.

1634
01:38:14,610 --> 01:38:17,980
看那该死的混蛋 酷哥 还假扮成百万富翁
Look at that fucking phony, Dude, pretending to be a fucking millionaire.

1635
01:38:17,980 --> 01:38:20,350
你们这些混混 给我滚出去!
Out of this house now, you bums!

1636
01:38:20,350 --> 01:38:22,010
让我告诉你别的事情
Let me tell you something else.

1637
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:25,750
我见过很多脊椎炎的 例子 酷哥 这家伙是假冒的
I've seen a lot of spinals, Dude, and this guy's a fake.

1638
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:29,720
该死的骗子 别靠近我!
A fucking gold-bricker. Stay away from me, mister!

1639
01:38:29,720 --> 01:38:31,460
他可以走路的
This guy fucking walks.

1640
01:38:31,460 --> 01:38:33,890
没什么比这个更加肯定了
I've never been more certain of anything in my life.

1641
01:38:33,890 --> 01:38:35,160
走开!
You stay away from me!

1642
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,660
沃尔特 他是个残废
Walter, for Christ's sake, man!He's a cripple.

1643
01:38:37,660 --> 01:38:39,500
快啊
I said!Get away from me!Come on. Come on.

1644
01:38:39,500 --> 01:38:43,070
走开!放他下来吧!
Walter, put him down, man!

1645
01:38:43,070 --> 01:38:46,810
我会的 酷哥!来吧!
Yeah, I'll put him down, Dude. Walk!Achtung, baby!

1646
01:39:04,020 --> 01:39:07,120
帮我把他放回椅子上面去
Come on, man. Help me put him back in his chair.

1647
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,250
当然你会看到一些坦克战的
Sure you'll see some tank battles,

1648
01:39:29,250 --> 01:39:32,780
但在沙漠作战和 在丛林作战非常不一样
but fighting in desert is very different from fighting in canopy jungle.

1649
01:39:33,850 --> 01:39:37,290
越战是步兵的战斗 所以这个对我...
I mean, Nam was a foot soldier's war, whereas this thing should...

1650
01:39:38,260 --> 01:39:40,590
小菜一碟
You know, should be a piece of cake.

1651
01:39:40,590 --> 01:39:44,130
我有一支M16 而不是一辆坦克
I mean, I had an M16, Jacko, not an Abrams fucking tank.

1652
01:39:44,130 --> 01:39:47,600
我和查理(越共的蔑称)面对面
Me and Charlie, eyeball to eyeball. Yeah.

1653
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:50,000
那才是战役
That's fucking combat.

1654
01:39:50,000 --> 01:39:52,970
那穿黑色长袍的家伙 酷哥
The man in the black pajamas, Dude.

1655
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:54,940
是个该死的对手
Worthy fucking adversary.

1656
01:39:54,940 --> 01:39:58,440
谁穿着长袍 沃尔特? 闭嘴 唐尼
Who's in pajamas, Walter? Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1657
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:00,750
我们有的只是...
Whereas what we have here,

1658
01:40:00,750 --> 01:40:02,980
那些把毛巾缠在头上的变态
a bunch of fig eaters wearing towels on their head,

1659
01:40:02,980 --> 01:40:05,150
为了弄翻那苏军的坦克
trying to find reverse on a Soviet tank.

1660
01:40:06,020 --> 01:40:08,290
- 这些对手不值得... - 嘿!
- This is not a worthy fucking adversary. - Hey!

1661
01:40:08,290 --> 01:40:10,390
这是说废话的日子吗?
What's this day-of-rest shit?

1662
01:40:10,390 --> 01:40:12,060
什么胡说八道的!
What's this bullshit?

1663
01:40:12,060 --> 01:40:15,190
我不在乎!对我来说不重要
I don't fucking care!It don't matter to Jesus.

1664
01:40:15,200 --> 01:40:16,730
但你们骗不了我
But you not fooling me, man.

1665
01:40:16,730 --> 01:40:19,530
你们也许能欺骗 那些比赛委员会的笨蛋
You might fool the fucks in the league office

1666
01:40:19,530 --> 01:40:21,830
但你骗不了我耶稣
but you don't fool Jesus.

1667
01:40:22,000 --> 01:40:24,800
那些都是胡话
It's Bush league psych-out stuff.

1668
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,200
真可笑!
Laughable, man!

1669
01:40:27,370 --> 01:40:30,470
我本来可以 在周六收拾你们的
I would've fucked you in the ass Saturday.

1670
01:40:31,210 --> 01:40:34,150
现在改成下周三也无所谓
I'll fuck you in the ass next Wednesday instead.

1671
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:38,050
你们周三有约了
You got a date Wednesday, baby!

1672
01:40:42,920 --> 01:40:44,190
他是个同性恋白鬼
He's cracking.

1673
01:40:44,190 --> 01:40:45,990
大亚洲的概念...
...the whole concept of age.

1674
01:40:45,990 --> 01:40:48,260
很多学者对此有争议
I mean, many learned men have disputed this

1675
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:51,130
但在14世纪...
but in the 14th century, the Rambam...

1676
01:41:01,140 --> 01:41:03,410
他们总算成功了
Well, they finally did it.

1677
01:41:03,410 --> 01:41:05,650
他们毁了我的车
They killed my fucking car.

1678
01:41:05,650 --> 01:41:09,280
我们要钱 李波斯基
We want the money, Lebowski.

1679
01:41:09,280 --> 01:41:11,880
不然我们就杀了那女孩
Ja. Otherwise, we kill the girl.

1680
01:41:11,890 --> 01:41:15,490
你似乎忘记了我们的 交易了 李波斯基
Ja. It seems you have forgotten our little deal, Lebowski.

1681
01:41:15,490 --> 01:41:18,320
那女孩不在你们手上 混蛋
You don't have the fucking girl, dipshit.

1682
01:41:18,330 --> 01:41:20,630
我们知道的
We know you never did.

1683
01:41:20,630 --> 01:41:22,300
他们是纳粹吗 沃尔特?
Are these the Nazis, Walter?

1684
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:24,100
不 唐尼 他们只是 些虚无主义者
No, Donny. These men are nihilists.

1685
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:25,530
没什么要害怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

1686
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:28,370
我们还是要钱
We don't care.

1687
01:41:28,370 --> 01:41:32,910
否则我们要对付你
We still want the money, Lebowski, or we fuck you up.

1688
01:41:32,910 --> 01:41:35,640
你们三个去死吧
Fuck you. Fuck the three of you. Cool it, Walter.

1689
01:41:35,640 --> 01:41:39,580
没有人质就没有赎金
No. Without a hostage, there is no ransom.

1690
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:43,020
赎金就是这样的 这是规矩
That's what ransom is. Those are the fucking rules.

1691
01:41:43,020 --> 01:41:45,420
他女朋友献出了一只脚趾
His girlfriend gave up her toe.

1692
01:41:45,420 --> 01:41:47,820
她以为我们可以 拿到一百万的
She thought we could get $1 million.

1693
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:50,420
- 这不公平 - 公平?
- It's not fair. - Fair?

1694
01:41:50,420 --> 01:41:54,130
那该死的家伙是谁? 你们这些娘娘腔的
Who's the fucking nihilists around here, you bunch of fucking crybabies?

1695
01:41:54,130 --> 01:41:56,600
沃尔特 冷静点
Cool it, Walter. Hey, look, pal.

1696
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,400
根本就没什么钱
There never was any money.

1697
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,600
老李波斯基给了 我一个空箱子
The big Lebowski gave me an empty briefcase,

1698
01:42:00,600 --> 01:42:02,740
你们去找他算帐吧
so take it up with him, man.

1699
01:42:02,740 --> 01:42:05,340
是啊 我还要拿回我的内裤
And I would like my undies back.

1700
01:42:05,340 --> 01:42:06,640
他们要伤害我们吗 沃尔特?
Are these guys gonna hurt us, Walter?

1701
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:09,210
不 唐尼 他们都是懦夫
No, Donny. These men are cowards.

1702
01:42:09,210 --> 01:42:10,580
好!
Okay!

1703
01:42:10,580 --> 01:42:14,100
那我们拿走你们身上的钱 这样就扯平了
So we takes the money you have on you, and we calls it even.

1739
01:44:44,160 --> 01:44:45,360
是的
Yeah.

1740
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,900
已经放进了骨灰罐
We have the urn.

1741
01:44:49,270 --> 01:44:51,470
这应该用信用卡结帐吧?
I assume this is credit card?

1742
01:44:52,670 --> 01:44:53,770
是的
Yeah.

1743
01:45:08,490 --> 01:45:09,890
这是什么?
What's this?

1744
01:45:10,660 --> 01:45:12,390
骨灰罐的钱
Now, that's for the urn.

1745
01:45:12,390 --> 01:45:14,420
没必要了 我们要将骨灰撒开
Don't need it. We're scattering the ashes.

1746
01:45:15,200 --> 01:45:17,930
好的
Yes. So we were informed.

1747
01:45:17,930 --> 01:45:21,730
但是...我们必须用一个
However, we must, of course, transmit the remains to you

1748
01:45:21,740 --> 01:45:23,330
容器转交给你们
in a receptacle.

1749
01:45:24,570 --> 01:45:26,370
要180美金啊
That's $180

1750
01:45:26,710 --> 01:45:30,640
这是我们最便宜的容器了
It is our most modestly priced receptacle.

1751
01:45:30,980 --> 01:45:33,210
- 我们能否...- 180美金?
- Well, can't we just... - $180?

1752
01:45:33,210 --> 01:45:35,200
最贵的可要3000呢
They range up to $3,000.

1753
01:45:36,020 --> 01:45:39,220
我们...可以租你们的吗?
We're... Can't we just rent it from you, you know?

1754
01:45:39,220 --> 01:45:42,150
先生 这里是殡仪馆 不是租借的地方
Sir, this is a mortuary not a rental house.

1755
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,560
我们只是要将骨灰撒开!
We're scattering the fucking ashes!Walter, Walter.

1756
01:45:44,560 --> 01:45:47,160
别当我们是傻瓜!
Just because we're bereaved doesn't make us saps.

1757
01:45:47,160 --> 01:45:49,630
先生 请小声一点
Sir, please lower your voices.

1758
01:45:49,630 --> 01:45:53,800
你们有没有...其他东西给我们放骨灰的吗?
Man, don't you have, you know, something else we can put him in?

1759
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:54,900
你知道
You know?

1760
01:45:54,900 --> 01:45:57,960
这是我们最便宜的容器了
That is our most modestly priced receptacle.

1761
01:45:58,240 --> 01:45:59,830
该死的!
God damn it!

1762
01:46:01,980 --> 01:46:03,640
这附近有超市吗?
Is there a Ralph's around here?

1763
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:33,300
唐尼是一个保龄球好手 也是一个好人
Donny was a good bowler and a good man.

1764
01:46:34,570 --> 01:46:36,780
他是我们的同伴
He was one of us.

1765
01:46:36,780 --> 01:46:40,710
一个热爱保龄的男人
He was a man who loved the outdoors and bowling.

1766
01:46:40,850 --> 01:46:44,650
他喜欢冲浪 热爱南加州的海滩
And as a surfer he explored the beaches of Southern California

1767
01:46:44,650 --> 01:46:50,110
从圣荷拉一直到普里斯莫
from La Jolla to Leo Carrillo and up to Pismo.

1768
01:46:50,920 --> 01:46:57,360
他英年早逝
He died as so many young men of his generation, before his time.

1769
01:46:57,360 --> 01:47:00,630
真主 以你的智慧 你带走了他
In your wisdom, Lord, you took him,

1770
01:47:00,630 --> 01:47:04,040
正如你带走了其他年轻人
as you took so many bright, flowering young men

1771
01:47:04,040 --> 01:47:06,940
在科沙 在兰多
at Khe Sanh, at Lan Doc,

1772
01:47:06,940 --> 01:47:08,670
还有北越的364高地
at Hill 364.

1773
01:47:09,980 --> 01:47:12,340
那些年轻人献出了生命
These young men gave their lives,

1774
01:47:12,950 --> 01:47:14,410
唐尼也如此
and so did Donny.

1775
01:47:16,550 --> 01:47:18,540
热爱保龄球的唐尼
Donny, who loved bowling.

1776
01:47:21,590 --> 01:47:26,590
唐尼.卡拉波索斯
And so,Theodore Donald Kerabatsos,

1777
01:47:27,890 --> 01:47:32,990
根据我们所想到的 你最后的愿望
in accordance with what we think your dying wishes might well have been,

1778
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:37,130
我们将你的骨灰
we commit your final mortal remains

1779
01:47:38,040 --> 01:47:40,440
投入太平洋的怀抱
to the bosom of the Pacific Ocean

1780
01:47:41,910 --> 01:47:43,880
这是你最喜爱的海洋
which you loved so well.

1781
01:47:46,210 --> 01:47:48,310
永别了 朋友
Good night, sweet prince.

1782
01:48:03,460 --> 01:48:04,860
该死的
Shit.

1783
01:48:06,800 --> 01:48:08,830
酷哥 对不起
Oh, shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1784
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:13,840
该死的大风 沃尔特
Goddamn wind. Fuck, god damn it, Walter!

1785
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:16,210
你这个混蛋!酷哥 对不起
You fucking asshole!Shit, Dude. I'm sorry.

1786
01:48:16,210 --> 01:48:18,510
跟你一起什么事都倒透霉
Everything's a fucking travesty with you, man!

1787
01:48:18,510 --> 01:48:20,180
对不起 那是意外
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

1788
01:48:20,180 --> 01:48:22,750
那些越战的鬼话是什么?
What was that shit about Vietnam? Dude, I'm sorry.

1789
01:48:22,750 --> 01:48:25,150
为什么所有事情 都和越南拉上关系?
What the fuck does anything have to do with Vietnam?

1790
01:48:25,150 --> 01:48:27,220
你在说什么鬼话?
Dude, I'm sorry. What the fuck are you talking about?

1791
01:48:27,220 --> 01:48:28,810
酷哥 对不起
Dude, I'm sorry.

1792
01:48:31,730 --> 01:48:32,950
你...
Fucking...

1793
01:48:39,930 --> 01:48:41,400
去你的 沃尔特
Fuck, Walter.

1794
01:48:43,300 --> 01:48:44,790
酷哥 别说了
Come on, Dude.

1795
01:48:45,640 --> 01:48:47,300
去你的
Hey, fuck it, man.

1796
01:48:51,210 --> 01:48:52,840
我们去打保龄吧
Let's go bowling.

1797
01:49:16,340 --> 01:49:19,640

And when you're sittin' there

1798
01:49:20,270 --> 01:49:23,400

In your silk upholstered chair

1799
01:49:24,910 --> 01:49:28,940

Talkin' to some rich folks that you know

1800
01:49:32,290 --> 01:49:35,120

Well, I hope you don't see me

1801
01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:39,350

In my ragged company

1802
01:49:40,130 --> 01:49:45,190

O? but you know I could never be alone

1803
01:49:47,370 --> 01:49:50,440
2份苏打水 加里 祝你们明天好运
Two oat sodas, Gary. Right. Good luck tomorrow.

1804
01:49:50,440 --> 01:49:53,970
好的 谢谢 唐尼的事我很难过
Yeah, thanks, man. I was sorry to hear about Donny.

1805
01:49:53,970 --> 01:49:56,840
是啊
Oh, yeah. Well, you know,

1806
01:49:57,680 --> 01:50:01,750
世事难料 有时候你吃熊 有时候...
sometimes you eat the bear, and sometimes, you know...

1807
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:03,010
嘿 你好
Hey, man.

1808
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:07,090
你好啊 酷哥 我还想着能否再见到你
How do you do, Dude? I wondered if I'd see you again.

1809
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:09,220
我没错过半决赛吧?
I wouldn't miss the semis.

1810
01:50:09,220 --> 01:50:10,920
最近怎么了?
Oh, yeah? How's things been going?

1811
01:50:10,920 --> 01:50:14,130
还是那样 有起有伏
Well, you know, strikes and gutters, ups and downs.

1812
01:50:14,130 --> 01:50:16,820
是啊
Sure. I got you. Yeah.

1813
01:50:18,400 --> 01:50:19,500
谢谢
Thanks, Gary.

1814
01:50:19,500 --> 01:50:21,930
我得回去了 保重
Well, take care, man. Gotta get back.

1815
01:50:21,940 --> 01:50:25,070
好的 酷哥 放轻松 好的
Sure. Take it easy, Dude. Oh, yeah.

1816
01:50:25,070 --> 01:50:27,240
我知道你会的
I know that you will.

1817
01:50:27,240 --> 01:50:30,570
当然了 没有什么酷哥迈不过的坎
Yeah. Well, the Dude abides.

1818
01:50:34,580 --> 01:50:35,780
沃尔特
Walter.

1819
01:50:37,480 --> 01:50:39,450
没有什么酷哥迈不过的坎
The Dude abides.

1820
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,690
不知道你是否这样 但我从中得到安慰
I don't know about you, but I take comfort in that.

1821
01:50:47,990 --> 01:50:50,300
看到酷哥一切如常
It's good knowing he's out there,

1822
01:50:50,300 --> 01:50:54,360
这让人很高兴
the Dude, taking her easy for all us sinners.

1823
01:50:57,100 --> 01:50:59,270
希望他能打进决赛
I sure hope he makes the finals.

1824
01:51:00,870 --> 01:51:04,570
将对手打个落花流水
Well, that about does her.Wraps her all up.

1825
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:09,640
酷哥和沃尔特的 状况似乎不错
Things seem to have worked out pretty good for the Dude and Walter.

1826
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:13,580
这也是一个不错的故事 你说不是吗?
And it was a pretty good story, don't you think?

1827
01:51:14,450 --> 01:51:16,790
逗我笑弯了腰
Made me laugh to beat the band.

1828
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:18,890
但也有泪
Parts anyway.

1829
01:51:20,460 --> 01:51:22,620
唐尼之死令我不忍
I didn't like seeing Donny go.

1830
01:51:23,730 --> 01:51:28,760
但我知道...一个小李波斯基 就要出现了
But then I happen to know that there's a little Lebowski on the way.

1831
01:51:30,440 --> 01:51:36,740
可悲的人类就是这样繁衍下去
I guess that's the way the whole darned human comedy keeps perpetuating itself

1832
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:38,910
一代接一代
down through the generations.

1833
01:51:39,410 --> 01:51:43,680
就如西部的大马车...横跨大沙漠...
Westward the wagons, across the sands of time until we...

1834
01:51:44,880 --> 01:51:48,080
看看我 又开始长篇大论了
Oh, look at me. I'm rambling again.

1835
01:51:49,490 --> 01:51:51,980
希望你们喜欢这个故事
Well, I hope you folks enjoyed yourselves.

1836
01:51:52,460 --> 01:51:54,790
在保龄球场上再见
Catch you later on down the trail.

1837
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:59,090
再给我一杯撒尔沙酒好吗?
Say, friend, you got any more of that good sarsaparilla?

1838
01:52:22,060 --> 01:52:26,120

Take me down

1854
01:54:16,570 --> 01:54:21,140

I know you think you're the queen

1855
01:54:21,140 --> 01:54:25,370

Of the underground

1856
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:30,980

Send me dead flowers every morning

1857
01:54:34,690 --> 01:54:39,420

Send me dead flowers by the mail

1858
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:42,460

Send me dead flowers to my wedding

1859
01:54:42,460 --> 01:54:46,060

And I won't forget to put roses on your grave

1860
01:54:47,630 --> 01:54:52,900

No, I won't forget to put roses

1861
01:54:52,910 --> 01:54:55,470

On your grave

1862
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,740

Bright light city gonna set my soul

1863
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:04,150

Gonna set my soul on fire

1864
01:55:06,220 --> 01:55:10,760

Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn

1865
01:55:10,760 --> 01:55:14,490

So get those stakes up higher

1866
01:55:16,030 --> 01:55:18,430

There's a thousand pretty women livin' out there

1867
01:55:18,430 --> 01:55:20,730

They're all livin' devil may care

1868
01:55:20,730 --> 01:55:24,760

And I'm just a devil with love to spare

1869
01:55:26,610 --> 01:55:30,700

So viva Las Vegas

1870
01:55:31,810 --> 01:55:36,040

Viva Las Vegas

1871
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:41,590

Viva Las Vegas with your neon flashing

1872
01:55:41,590 --> 01:55:45,790

And your one-arm bandits crashing

1873
01:55:47,330 --> 01:55:51,090

All those hopes down the drain

1874
01:55:52,470 --> 01:55:56,660

Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime

1875
01:55:57,540 --> 01:55:59,400

Night into daytime

1876
01:56:00,410 --> 01:56:01,900

If you see it once

1877
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:04,370

You'll never be the same again

1878
01:56:05,480 --> 01:56:08,710

I'm gonna keep on keep on runnin'

1879
01:56:12,480 --> 01:56:15,710
