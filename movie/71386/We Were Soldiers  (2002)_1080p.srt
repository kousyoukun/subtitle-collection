1
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:40,920
These are the true
events of November, 1965

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,540
The la Drang Valley of Vietnam

3
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,210
a place our country does not remember...

4
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,720
in a war it does not understand.

5
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,260
This story's a testament
to the young Americans...

6
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:54,260
who died in the Valley of Death...

7
00:00:54,350 --> 00:00:56,770
and a tribute to the young men
of the Peoples Army of Vietnam...

8
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,770
who died by our hand in that place.

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,020
To tell this story, I must
start at the beginning.

10
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,740
But where does it begin?

11
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:14,700
Maybe in June of 1954, when
French Group Mobile 100...

12
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:17,620
moved into the same Central
Highlands of Vietnam...

13
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,120
where we would go 11 years later.

14
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:20,800
Maybe the story begins in America...

15
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:24,760
when the army first realized a
new kind of war was coming its way.

16
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:27,390
The White House anticipates a
buildup and wants a victory...

17
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,390
over cavemen in black pajamas.

18
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,020
We wouldn't be there if they hadn't
already beaten the French Army.

19
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,030
The French Army? What's that?

20
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,320
The problem in Vietnam is terrain
jungles, mountains, rivers.

21
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,820
Maneuver's a nightmare.

22
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:43,240
We have a plan to use helicopters
leap in and out of battle.

23
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,290
They want you to run
the test on the idea.

24
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:48,120
It'll take a hell of a combat leader.

25
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,670
I know a young light
colonel named Hal Moore.

26
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:52,670
He led a combat company in Korea.

27
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,420
After that, he volunteered to
test experimental parachutes.

28
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,130
Experimental parachutes?
Sounds like just the guy.

29
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:03,640
The other side of the mountain
was all that he could see

30
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:07,680
Was all that he could see
Was all that he could see

31
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:12,850
The other side of the mountain
was all that he could see

32
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,650
The bear went over the mountain
The bear went over the mountain

33
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,150
The bear went over the mountain

34
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,820
How about we go back to "Bingo"?
What do you say? "Bingo".

35
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:25,080

B-I-N-G-O

36
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,790

B-I-N-G-O

37
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,870

B-I-N-G-O

38
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,330
And Bingo was his name-o

39
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,310
Tom, how much you know
about our new colonel?

40
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,980
He was in Korea...

41
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,400
has a master's in international
relations from Harvard.

42
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,940
Harvard? He's not one of
those academic pussies, is he?

43
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,440
Hal Moore?

44
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,660
Want me to get one of those?

45
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,750
Come on, Too Tall. Gimme your best shot!

46
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,300
Did you see that, sports
fans? Did you see that?

47
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,880
Snakeshit drives that
one to the moon, baby!

48
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,470
Hit the cutoff man! Hit the cutoff man!

49
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,720
And he's coming around!

50
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,930
- Here he comes!
- No, he's not.

51
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,400
You're out! You're out!

52
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,730
Horseshit! No wonder you
can't fly. You can't see.

53
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,110
I believe you're out.

54
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,080
- You're a pilot?
- Too Tall, sir.

55
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,040
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You call, we haul.

56
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,760
- Can I speak to you, Crandall?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,930
- Out.
- Safe.

58
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,050
- Out.
- Safe.

59
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,890
- Can I buy you a drink?
- Sure.

60
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,390
Thanks.

61
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,690
So, your men call you "Snakeshit".

62
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:01,440
That's an affectionate appellation
of my comrades-in-arms, sir...

63
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,570
'cause I fly lower than snake shit.

64
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,610
Well, I got a problem, Snakeshit,
and I think you're the solution.

65
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,240
I've been called a lot of
things, Colonel, never a solution.

66
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,870
You know what air cavalry really means?

67
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:17,250
You fly into hostile territory,
outnumbered 10,000 miles from home.

68
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,500
Sometimes the battleground's
no bigger than a football field.

69
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:23,920
And if the choppers stop
comin', we all get slaughtered.

70
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,920
Now, I figure chopper pilots won't
fly into hell for strangers...

71
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:29,510
so... I'm Hal Moore.

72
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,680
I know, sir. Why us?

73
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,980
Well, you guys look like shit,
but your equipment is immaculate.

74
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:41,020
Yesterday was Sunday. You didn't
have to be training, but you were.

75
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,940
You got pilots like
that Too Tall character.

76
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,030
He's way outside the
limits of army regs.

77
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:48,530
They wanna fly with you for some reason.

78
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:50,530
I guess it's 'cause they
think you're the best.

79
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:53,160
It's 'cause I only
recruit the dumb ones, sir.

80
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,290
I don't suppose I have
a choice in all this.

81
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,040
You sure don't.

82
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:04,790
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

83
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,340
To the Air Cav.

84
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,720
Good mornin', Sergeant Major.

85
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,770
How do you know what
kind of goddamn day it is?

86
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,950
Group! Atten-hut!

87
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,390
At ease, gentlemen.

88
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,230
Welcome to the new cavalry.

89
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,690
We will ride into battle.

90
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,980
And this... will be our horse.

91
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,300
You don't have to catch it.
You don't have to feed it.

92
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,430
But I can assure you...

93
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:45,810
that neither the new technology
nor your status as officers...

94
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,230
will keep you above the danger.

95
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,450
Sergeant-Major Plumley and I
come from the paratroopers...

96
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:57,120
where the officer is always
the first one out of the plane.

97
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,120
Because to follow your instincts...

98
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
and to inspire your
men by your example...

99
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:09,130
you have to be with them
where the metal meets the meat.

100
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,760
Sergeant-Major Plumley made
all four combat jumps...

101
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,380
in the 82nd Airborne
during World War II.

102
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:17,550
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy...

103
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,680
and Holland, plus one more in Korea.

104
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,690
He answers to me and to me alone.

105
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,690
Now, I hope you
gentlemen like training...

106
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:31,110
'cause me and the sergeant-major

107
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,280
we love it.

108
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,910
Three strikes and you're not out!

109
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,910
There is always one
more thing you can do.

110
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,510
Here we go, boys.

111
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:57,840
Move! Move! Go! Now!

112
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:00,050
- Two.
- Let's go!

113
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,060
Three.

114
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,520
We're outta here!

115
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,640
- Pretty good, huh?
- Pretty good.

116
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,860
There's only one thing wrong.

117
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:15,240
Be sharp! We will be the best
platoon in this battalion!

118
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,740
Be ready in there! Let's go! Let's go!

119
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,450
All right! Your officer's dead!

120
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,490
- What do you do? What do you do?
- First

121
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:25,500
All right, he hesitated.
He's dead. What do you do?

122
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,710
- Get off the chopper!
- Get off the chopper.

123
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,220
Hold off the third one.

124
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,840
Come on in.

125
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,430
Savage, you learn the job
of the man above you...

126
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,850
and you teach your job to
the man below you in rank.

127
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,850
That goes for every man in this outfit.

128
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,520
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

129
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,230
We'll be landing under fire, gentlemen.

130
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,940
Men will die.

131
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,950
Have you said your prayers?

132
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:10,870
Come on. I'll say them with you.

133
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,040
- Fall in.
- Gimme that bear.

134
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,670
All right. Ready. Set.

135
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:23,140
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

136
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,390
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

137
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:28,350
Blessed art thou amongst women...

138
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,060
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb Jesus.

139
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:32,850
Holy Mary, Mother of
God, pray for us sinners

140
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,900
Cecile, I don't hear you praying, honey.

141
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,070
I don't wanna be Catholic. I
wanna be a "Nethodist" like Mommy.

142
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,030
You do?

143
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:44,240
And why is that, honey?

144
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,370
So I can pray whatever I want.

145
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:48,580
That's a sin.

146
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,580
No, that's not a sin.

147
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,830
God just made you
hardheaded. It's not a sin.

148
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,460
I'll tell you what. You wanna

149
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,010
You wanna pray and
thank God for our family?

150
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:04,390
- Yes, sir.
- That's good. Let's do it.

151
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:08,010
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

152
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,180
Blessed art thou among women...

153
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,440
and blessed is the
fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

154
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,490
I can hear you laughing,
you know, even in here.

155
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,360
I'm not laughing, I'm marveling.

156
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,700
Marveling? At what?

157
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,120
That you can find stubbornness
in your children...

158
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,750
and think it comes from anybody but you.

159
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,250
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:38,090
I'll give you something to marvel at.

161
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,920
He's a wild man.

162
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:03,860
- When I
pray - Mm-hmm.

163
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,360
whatever I want

164
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,580
I thank God for you.

165
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,760
Beautiful morning, Sergeant Major.

166
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,300
What are you, a fuckin' weatherman now?

167
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,680
Look what I found for
the new baseball player.

168
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:36,140
- Sent us another bunch
of officers. - Uh-huh.

169
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:38,690
Real green. Gotta train 'em up.

170
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:41,070
Makes me think I'm starting a new unit.

171
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,230
They sent new rifles too. The M-16.

172
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,280
That's supposed to be
a pretty good weapon.

173
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,280
Lots of plastic.

174
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:51,830
Feels like a BB gun to me.
Believe I'll stick with my pistol.

175
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,910
You think we're gonna get close
enough to the enemy to use that?

176
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,540
What do you think, sir?

177
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,710
A leader must remain cool and calm.

178
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,670
And second, he must learn
to ignore explosions...

179
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,550
the heat and dust, the
screams of the wounded.

180
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:11,220
This is normal on a battlefield. Normal!

181
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,070
Fortran, you need to get a company
over to reinforce the left flank.

182
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:31,740
- Where is that coming from?
- That's our advisors in Vietnam.

183
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:34,740
The new radio's picking
up atmospheric bounce.

184
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,310
When Crazy Horse was a baby...

185
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:02,940
he nursed from the breast
of every woman in the tribe.

186
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,490
The Sioux raised their
children that way.

187
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:09,990
Every warrior...

188
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:13,030
called every woman
in the tribe "mother".

189
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,540
Every older warrior, they
called him "grandfather".

190
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:19,830
Now, the point here is that
they fought as a family.

191
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,420
Take care of your men.

192
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,460
Teach them to take care of each other.

193
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,470
'Cause when this starts...

194
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,430
each other is all we're gonna have.

195
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:42,520
- Did you tune that in?
- Yes, sir.

196
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,860
Well, that's fine.
You're my radio operator.

197
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,940
You'll be fine. You'll work it out.

198
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,750
Any of you sons of
bitches calls me Grandpa...

199
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,250
I'll kill ya.

200
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,110
Godboldt, take your boots off.

201
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,940
Go on.

202
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:36,700
Everybody, take your
boots off. Everybody.

203
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,950
Socks too.

204
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,260
I want you to draw
fresh socks from supply.

205
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,970
Keep your feet dusted with powder.

206
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:04,140
Everybody check each other's
feet like Godboldt and me.

207
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,900
Now, that young man's a leader.

208
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,570
Yes, sir.

209
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:12,860
That other fella that
big, strong one there

210
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,860
he wants to win medals.

211
00:19:18,370 --> 00:19:20,040
Why were you in the back?

212
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,250
Goddamn it, why were you in the back?

213
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,250
He's eager.

214
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:31,170
Ladies, I'm really, really
glad you're here today.

215
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:36,470
Some of you are new to the army
and all of us are new to this post.

216
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:40,010
I thought we'd pool our resources
and cover questions we have.

217
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:43,310
So, why don't we start
with item number one food.

218
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,810
Where's the best place to shop?

219
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:51,110
Well, I tried Big Star, and it's okay.

220
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,320
But I keep thinking my water's gonna
break right in the checkout aisle.

221
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:01,370
That takes care of food shopping.
So, item number two laundry.

222
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,910
The base washing machines don't work.

223
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,250
They're full of sand
from the swamp missions.

224
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:07,000
I'll take care of that.

225
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,090
- I've already complained.
- We'll just go to the general.

226
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,510
In the meantime, the
Laundromat in town's okay...

227
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:17,050
but they won't let you wash your
colored things in their machines.

228
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:20,010
- At a public Laundromat?
- Didn't make sense to me either.

229
00:20:20,050 --> 00:20:22,010
I'm telling you, they have
a sign right in the window...

230
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,390
says "Whites Only".

231
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:30,310
- What?
- They mean white people only.

232
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:33,610
That's awful.

233
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:37,610
Your husband is wearing the uniform
of a country that allows a place...

234
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:43,240
to say his laundry's not good
enough, when he could die for

235
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,540
- I'm sorry. I just
- That's all right, honey.

236
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,460
I know what my husband's fighting
for, and that's why I can smile.

237
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,050
My husband will never ask for respect...

238
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,260
and he'll give respect to
no man who hasn't earned it.

239
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,510
The rest of his family is the same way.

240
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,720
Anybody who doesn't respect that
can keep his washing machine...

241
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,890
'cause my baby's clothes
are gonna be clean anyway.

242
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:13,770
Well, I guess that takes
care of item number two.

243
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,650
Are you all right?

244
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,780
I think I think my water just broke.

245
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:25,330
We're all calm. We're all calm.

246
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,750
A car! A car!

247
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,240
- Colonel.
- At ease. At ease.

248
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,530
I heard one of my new
lieutenants just became a father.

249
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,540
- I came to say congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

250
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,330
So, I didn't wanna disturb you.

251
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:14,500
No, it's fine. It's all right. Please.

252
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,540
Well, how's your wife?

253
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:19,170
She's okay. She's okay. She's sleeping.

254
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,680
So is my daughter. I just...

255
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,300
wanted to be here for a
while before I held her.

256
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,560
Well, tag her already?

257
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,180
- What's that say?
- Camille. Sorry about this, sir.

258
00:22:30,230 --> 00:22:32,890
Don't take that off. Leave that
where it is. That's an order.

259
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,230
- Colonel, may I ask you a question?
- Sure.

260
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:44,360
What do you think about
being a soldier and a father?

261
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,830
I hope that being good at the one...

262
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,870
makes me better at the other.

263
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,870
Why? What about you?

264
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,710
I don't know, sir.

265
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,710
Between college and here...

266
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:03,170
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa.

267
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,310
We helped build a school for orphans.

268
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,640
They were orphans because the
warlord across the border...

269
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:14,640
didn't like their tribe.

270
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,530
I know God has a plan for me.

271
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:25,320
I just hope it's to
help protect orphans...

272
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,740
not make any.

273
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:34,460
Well, why don't we ask him?

274
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,630
Come on. Let's go ask him.

275
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,840
Our Father in Heaven,
before we go into battle...

276
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,140
every soldier among us will
approach you each in his own way.

277
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:52,270
Our enemies too...

278
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:53,930
according to their own understanding...

279
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,770
will ask for protection and for victory.

280
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:00,020
And so, we bow before
your infinite wisdom.

281
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,480
We offer our prayers as best we can.

282
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,910
I pray you watch over the young
men, like Jack Geoghegan...

283
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,330
that I lead into battle.

284
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,910
You use me as your instrument
in this awful hell of war...

285
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:14,750
to watch over them.

286
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:18,630
Especially if they're men
like this one beside me...

287
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:21,460
deserving of a future in
your blessing and good will.

288
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,880
- Amen.
- Amen.

289
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,100
Yes, and one more thing, dear Lord...

290
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,600
about our enemies

291
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,310
ignore their heathen prayers...

292
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:38,440
and help us blow those little
bastards straight to hell.

293
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:40,690
Amen again.

294
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,940
Amen.

295
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,440
Thank you.

296
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,030
There's one about the kid with the
apple tree, or the flying horse...

297
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:56,000
or the fairy tales with
the deer and stuff in 'em.

298
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,750
Daddy, what is a war?

299
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,840
A war is a

300
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,840
Well, it's

301
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:15,350
It's something that
shouldn't happen, but it does.

302
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:19,640
It's when...

303
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:23,940
some people in another
country or any country

304
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,530
try to take the lives of other people.

305
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,280
And then soldiers
like your daddy have to

306
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,910
It's my job to go over
there and stop them.

307
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:39,410
Are they gonna try to
take your life away, Daddy?

308
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:46,420
Well, yes, they're gonna try.

309
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,420
But I'm not gonna let 'em.

310
00:25:49,970 --> 00:25:50,930
Okay?

311
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,120
Can't sleep?

312
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,130
The men are so young and

313
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,840
Now they sent me a
new crop even greener.

314
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:11,880
When I look at them, I...

315
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,470
see our boys.

316
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,470
Well, then you're just
the man to lead them.

317
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,980
I guess.

318
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,370
We intend to convince the Communists...

319
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,500
that we cannot be
defeated by force of arms.

320
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:50,210
I have asked the commanding
general, General Westmoreland...

321
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:55,130
what more he needs to meet
this mounting aggression.

322
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,260
He has told me...

323
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,430
and we will meet his needs.

324
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:07,730
I have today ordered to Vietnam
the airmobile division...

325
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,980
and certain other forces which
will raise our fighting strength...

326
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,780
from 75,000 to...

327
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:17,570
125,000 men almost immediately.

328
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:21,120
Additional forces will be needed later.

329
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,910
Get out your best dresses, ladies.

330
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,920
They're gonna want to celebrate.

331
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:45,060
Don't you ever be sad

332
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:49,230
Lean on me when the times are bad

333
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,440
I didn't hear the president
mention a state of emergency.

334
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,990
No, he didn't.

335
00:28:56,030 --> 00:29:00,070
Well, without that declaration
our enlistments won't be extended.

336
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,780
I'm sorry, Hal.

337
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:05,870
Forgive me, sir, but
let me get this straight.

338
00:29:05,950 --> 00:29:09,460
We form a division using techniques
never attempted in battle...

339
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:13,800
against an enemy with 20 years of
combat experience on his ground...

340
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,550
12,000 miles away from our ground.

341
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:19,430
And right before the army
sends us into the fight...

342
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,800
they take away a third of my most
experienced men, including officers.

343
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:25,970
I don't like it any
better than you do, Hal.

344
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,690
You saw this coming, didn't you?

345
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,730
Yes. That's why you gave me
that new crop of platoon leaders.

346
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,740
Korea didn't teach 'em anything.

347
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,280
- Politicians?
- Politicians.

348
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,210
Hold me, hold me

349
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:52,420
Never let me go

350
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:57,050
Until you've told me told me

351
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:02,010
What I want to know
and then just hold me

352
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,760
Hold me Make me tell you

353
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:08,980
I'm in love with you

354
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,780
Thrill me, thrill me

355
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:19,740
Thank you, sir.

356
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,950
By the way, Hal, since
we're being deployed...

357
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,530
they're renumbering the units.

358
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:25,030
You're now the commanding officer...

359
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:28,040
of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry.

360
00:30:30,790 --> 00:30:32,250
The 7th.

361
00:30:33,710 --> 00:30:35,630
The same regiment as Custer.

362
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,420
Thank you, sir.

363
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:44,640
Be sensible with your new love

364
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,520
Don't be fooled thinking

365
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,940
This is the last you'll find

366
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:55,860
But they never stood in the dark

367
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,070
With you, love

368
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,150
When you take me in your arms

369
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,530
And drive me slowly out of my mind

370
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,410
Kiss me, kiss me

371
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:11,830
And when you do I'll know

372
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:51,470
Look around you.

373
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:56,310
In the 7th Cavalry...

374
00:32:56,350 --> 00:32:59,350
we got a captain from the Ukraine.

375
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,480
Another from Puerto Rico.

376
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:05,860
We've got Japanese, Chinese...

377
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,860
Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indians.

378
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:13,160
Jews and gentiles.

379
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,700
All Americans.

380
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:18,830
Now, here in the States...

381
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,040
some men in this unit...

382
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,550
may experience discrimination
because of race or creed.

383
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,550
But for you and me now...

384
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,600
all that is gone.

385
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,180
We're moving into the Valley
of the Shadow of Death...

386
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:41,860
where you will watch the
back of the man next to you...

387
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,110
as he will watch yours.

388
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,570
And you won't care what color he is...

389
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:50,110
or by what name he calls God.

390
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,120
They say we're leaving home.

391
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:59,370
We're going to what home
was always supposed to be.

392
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,000
So let us understand the situation.

393
00:34:05,090 --> 00:34:08,050
We are going into battle...

394
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:11,090
against a tough and determined enemy.

395
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,600
I can't promise you...

396
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,900
that I will bring you all home alive.

397
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:24,940
But this I swear

398
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,740
before you and before Almighty God

399
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,780
that when we go into battle...

400
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,410
I will be the first to
set foot on the field...

401
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:40,410
and I will be the last to step off.

402
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:46,250
And I will leave no one behind.

403
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,720
Dead or alive...

404
00:34:54,590 --> 00:34:57,060
we will all come home together.

405
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:01,890
So help me God.

406
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:30,190
I love you.

407
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:32,120
Hal, last night the enemy
hit our camp at Plaei Me.

408
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,700
- How many casualties?
- None.

409
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,910
The enemy forces withdrew
toward this mountain...

410
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,620
near the Cambodian border.

411
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,920
How many men do you have battle-ready?

412
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,800
- Sergeant Major? - Three
hundred ninety-five, sir.

413
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,050
Exactly.

414
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,590
What do you estimate the enemy strength?

415
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,970
We appraise their numbers
as manageable, Colonel.

416
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,050
You have no idea.

417
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:56,640
We have no idea. Simple orders, Hal.

418
00:41:56,730 --> 00:41:59,100
Find the enemy and kill him.

419
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:06,230
They attack us, no casualties.
They run and hide in the mountains.

420
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,820
Naturally we chase them, of course.

421
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,740
Smell like an ambush to you?

422
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:16,750
They get close enough to kill us,
we'll be close enough to kill them.

423
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,170
Round trip by chopper, 30 minutes.

424
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:27,920
So the first 60 men on the ground
will be there half an hour alone.

425
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,420
Son of a bitch.

426
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:34,220
I think maybe you ought
to get yourself that M-16.

427
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,220
Time comes I need one, there'll be
plenty of 'em lying on the ground.

428
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:46,570
Well, let's go do what
we came here to do.

429
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,070
Yes, sir.

430
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,750
Garry Owen!

431
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,860
It was a Sunday.

432
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:18,740
November 14, 1965.

433
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:23,040
Before that day, the
soldiers of North Vietnam...

434
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,580
and those of America...

435
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,500
never met each other in a major battle.

436
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,820
Two miles out. Dropping
to nap of the earth.

437
00:48:01,260 --> 00:48:04,430
First Platoon, let's move!

438
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:18,690
This is Trojan Two. All units
maintain perimeter contact. Over.

439
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:24,820
It's a scout! Let's take him prisoner!

440
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:27,280
Hey! Lieutenant!

441
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:34,750
There he goes! Come on!

442
00:48:39,460 --> 00:48:40,960
Come on!

443
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,880
Captain, I want you to keep
in contact with all patrols.

444
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:48,970
Hey, I got something
here. I got a boy! Here.

445
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,310
Boy, hell.

446
00:48:50,390 --> 00:48:51,810
That ain't no boy.

447
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,610
- He say he a deserter.
- Bullshit, he's a lookout.

448
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:01,610
Ask him where his friends are.

449
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,200
He say this is base
camp of whole division.

450
00:49:11,030 --> 00:49:12,910
- Four thousand men.
- Where?

451
00:49:18,710 --> 00:49:20,500
That mountain.

452
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,180
Same army destroyed French.

453
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,180
And he say they want
kill American very badly.

454
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:36,310
Just not been able to find any yet.

455
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,770
Captain Metsker, tell all
patrols to hold their positions.

456
00:49:48,530 --> 00:49:50,490
You, take the radio!

457
00:49:52,410 --> 00:49:55,500
- Where are they?
- Sir, we gotta get that guy!

458
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,630
Call in all the patrols!

459
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:06,970
We have to engage the enemy as
far away from the LZ as possible!

460
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,760
Net Call, Net Call, this is Trojan-Two.

461
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,890
Grab the wounded! Break contact!

462
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,560
Fall back! Get to high ground!

463
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:21,400
Cover fire! Get to high ground!

464
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,860
Come on!

465
00:50:33,070 --> 00:50:36,080
Come on! Get up here! Bring
the wounded up to the middle!

466
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,910
Move it, move it!

467
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,290
Cover fire! Cover fire!

468
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:46,090
Everybody down! Down!

469
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:52,180
Check your ammo! Everybody check ammo!

470
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,480
Come on! I'll get us out of here!

471
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:05,070
Grab the wounded! We'll make a run

472
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,230
- Sarge!
- We gotta get out of here!

473
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:12,110
Stay down! Don't anybody move!

474
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,910
Bungum, stay down!

475
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:27,630
You're gonna be okay.

476
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:32,300
Stay down.

477
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,890
Form a perimeter!

478
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,270
Conserve your ammo and stay down!

479
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:42,850
What's happening with those patrols?

480
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:46,820
I'm trying to reach them, sir!
This is Trojan-Two! Come in! Over!

481
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:50,490
Hey! Hey! Calm down!

482
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,910
Understand the situation
and communicate clearly!

483
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,790
Pull the chain on all the firepower
you can get on that mountain!

484
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,500
Alert Crandall! We have a hot LZ!!

485
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,130
Agent Serpent-Six,
this is Trojan-Two.

486
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:10,050
You're coming into a hot
LZ. We are taking fire.

487
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:12,050
Repeat. We are taking fire.

488
00:52:13,170 --> 00:52:14,590
No shit.

489
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,310
This is Too Tall goin' down and dirty.

490
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:25,850
Roger that! Trojan-Two, out!

491
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,520
Herrick's platoon is
cut off and under attack.

492
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:30,030
Bravo Company's holding.

493
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,030
They're gonna try and flank us.

494
00:52:41,450 --> 00:52:43,540
On the ground now! Move!

495
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,540
- Watch him!
- We gotta go.

496
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,000
We're outta here.

497
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,800
They're coming at us
from the back now! Move!

498
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,260
Savage.

499
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:04,640
All right, all right, I got you.

500
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:07,060
Sir?

501
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:11,070
Don't let them get the signal codes.

502
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:13,940
Roger that, sir.

503
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,410
I'm glad I could die for my country.

504
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,090
Doc.

505
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,030
Bungum.

506
00:53:55,110 --> 00:53:56,530
Sarge?

507
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,700
Tell my wife...

508
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,500
I love her.

509
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:10,540
This is Savage.

510
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:15,260
I need artillery to these
coordinates: niner-3-3-0-1

511
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:21,090
Ernie! Ernie, help! We got more coming!

512
00:54:21,140 --> 00:54:23,760
We are cut off. Copy? We are cut off.

513
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,520
- Fire!
- Fire!

514
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,190
- Fire!
- Fire!

515
00:54:32,190 --> 00:54:33,730
They're getting closer!

516
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:38,190
They're getting closer!
A hundred more, sir!

517
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:49,250
They're right on top of
us, sir! Bring it in close!

518
00:55:52,890 --> 00:55:56,860
It's a hot LZ! We'll be
jumping! We will not touch down.

519
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,210
They're trying to
break right through us!

520
00:56:12,250 --> 00:56:16,380
I want you to reinforce Alpha
Company there! Now! Move!

521
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,590
Follow me! Charlie
Company, up on the ridge!

522
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:22,630
Doc, the wounded are over
by that termite mound! Go!

523
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,430
Sir, if you don't find some
cover, you're gonna go down!

524
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:28,050
If you go down, we all go down! Come on!

525
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,990
Cobain!

526
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,160
I want the M-60 right here!

527
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:56,420
Radio!

528
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,670
Sir, it's Captain
Edwards on the ridge, sir!

529
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,380
- Bob!
- Colonel, these guys are regulars!

530
00:57:05,470 --> 00:57:09,430
Heavily armed! AK-47s
and pouches of grenades!

531
00:57:09,470 --> 00:57:11,970
Heavy machine guns and
shoulder-fired rockets!

532
00:57:30,330 --> 00:57:32,040
Captain Nadal!

533
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,000
That creek bed is vital. Vital!

534
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:38,000
They'll be coming right at
you! Do not let them flank!

535
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,290
I repeat, do not let them flank!

536
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,800
Secure the creek bed!

537
00:57:59,770 --> 00:58:02,690
Tom, I want you to keep trying
to raise those Medevac boys.

538
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:17,660
I'm all right.

539
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:19,670
Charlie, come here.

540
00:58:19,710 --> 00:58:23,300
Get me all the air support you
can get me on that mountain! Now!

541
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,460
Requesting immediate close air support!

542
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,420
I need you to burn 'em out...

543
00:58:27,510 --> 00:58:31,890
on hilltop Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo!

544
00:58:31,970 --> 00:58:36,180
Coordinates:
Golf-4-5-0-9!

545
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,530
- Get me something higher up!
- Shifting to hilltop Bravo!

546
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:58,000

Golf-4-5-7-2!

547
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:03,040
I say again,
4-5-7-2!

548
00:59:15,010 --> 00:59:17,890
Medevac Command of the 7th
Cavalry, are you inbound?

549
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:19,890
Looks pretty hot down there.

550
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:23,440
Yeah. You can make it, though.
Watch our approach, follow us in.

551
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:26,940
Copy that, 7th Cav. We
will follow your approach.

552
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:48,170
I want you to get over there and
reinforce Charlie Company there!

553
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:53,260
Medevac, abort! Abort! This is a hot LZ!

554
00:59:53,300 --> 00:59:57,430
You see that? My Medevac guys are
buggin' out and leaving the wounded!

555
01:00:00,890 --> 01:00:02,100
We're going down!

556
01:00:12,070 --> 01:00:15,160
- Snake, get out of here!
- Bring me the wounded!

557
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,780
Wounded! Get the wounded!

558
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:18,660
Come on! Come on!

559
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,630
Okay, here!

560
01:00:25,710 --> 01:00:28,670
They're still trying to flank
us! Stretch out along the line!

561
01:00:33,170 --> 01:00:34,630
Radio!

562
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:41,810
Trojan-Six! We are in heavy
contact! In danger of being overrun!

563
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:45,230
If they get into that LZ,
we've all had it. Can you hold?

564
01:00:45,310 --> 01:00:47,810
We're spread thin, sir,
but we'll give 'em hell!

565
01:00:55,490 --> 01:00:58,410
Crandall, this is Trojan-Six.
It's too hot down here.

566
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:01,410
- I'm closing the LZ.
- You copy that, Too Tall?

567
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:03,500
Copy that, Snake.

568
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:06,540
All 7th Cav air units:
LZ X-Ray is closed.

569
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:09,790
I don't like it. First time
out, a whole battalion massacred?

570
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:12,010
You think this is a massacre?

571
01:01:12,090 --> 01:01:15,380
Losing draftees is a bad week.
Losing a colonel is a massacre.

572
01:01:15,470 --> 01:01:16,890
Moore is still fighting.

573
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:19,010
He's under strength against
more men than he can count.

574
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,770
- He's got a whole platoon lost.
- They're not lost.

575
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:23,980
They're only cut off and surrounded.

576
01:01:27,270 --> 01:01:28,860
Then they're lost.

577
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,360
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

578
01:01:33,320 --> 01:01:36,820
We need to carve out an
emergency LZ right over there.

579
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:38,870
- Sir!
- Blow the trees down!

580
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,380
Fire in the hole!

581
01:01:56,260 --> 01:01:58,340
Colonel, this is Snakeshit and Too Tall.

582
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:00,300
We're comin' in with two loads of ammo.

583
01:02:00,390 --> 01:02:02,350
Crandall, we've blown a new LZ.

584
01:02:02,470 --> 01:02:04,930
When you come in, come
in from the east. Out.

585
01:02:09,270 --> 01:02:11,360
Colonel, it's Brigade
Headquarters. They want you out.

586
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:14,940
- Well, we can't get out, damn it!
- Not all of us. Just you.

587
01:02:15,030 --> 01:02:17,950
Saigon wants to debrief you.

588
01:02:17,990 --> 01:02:20,450
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Say again.

589
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,910
Will you repeat that order?

590
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:31,040
Too Tall, follow the
colonel to the new LZ.

591
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,040
I see him, Snake.

592
01:02:37,130 --> 01:02:39,630
He's right here! Let's go! Move!

593
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:43,760
Let's move! Move!

594
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,560
Oh, shit.

595
01:02:46,640 --> 01:02:49,980
- Come on! We'll give you a hand!
- We're moving on board!

596
01:02:50,020 --> 01:02:53,110
All right, get that ammo
off and get the wounded on!

597
01:02:53,190 --> 01:02:55,730
Bring 'em on! Get 'em on, boys!

598
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:04,030
No, we're overloaded!

599
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,870
- Leave him!
- I'll get out! It's Ray!

600
01:03:05,950 --> 01:03:08,460
He's hurt worse than me!

601
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,330
You hang on! I'll see
you back there, Ray!

602
01:03:37,570 --> 01:03:39,900
You, me and Ouellette are
all we have in reserve.

603
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:42,530
Yeah, but it's slacking up a little.

604
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:46,200
No, they're just regrouping
for another assault.

605
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,370
Distribute that ammo.

606
01:03:48,450 --> 01:03:52,540
Ouellette, tell Crandall he's got
time to get one more flight in here.

607
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:53,580
Yes, sir.

608
01:03:57,250 --> 01:04:00,170
Doc, you give this water to the wounded.

609
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:05,260
Running out of water.
Must be terrible for 'em.

610
01:04:06,010 --> 01:04:08,430
Those guys are cut off out there.

611
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:16,230
Running low on ammo, Sarge!

612
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:19,150
Pick your target. One shot, one kill.

613
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,900
- Roger that, Sarge.
- How we doin', Doc?

614
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:24,030
Ernie, we're out of water.

615
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:27,370
That's the last of it.

616
01:04:42,050 --> 01:04:43,970
My face is on fire! Help!

617
01:04:44,050 --> 01:04:46,510
Foster, hold still! Hold still!

618
01:04:46,600 --> 01:04:48,390
I'll cut your face! Hold still!

619
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,870
Doc, Doc, it's Foster!

620
01:05:04,950 --> 01:05:06,200
Okay.

621
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,620
Does anybody have any more bandages?

622
01:05:27,260 --> 01:05:29,270
Ernie, you hit too? You hit?

623
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:30,730
No, no, I'm okay.

624
01:05:30,810 --> 01:05:33,060
Our guys are gonna come
for us, aren't they?

625
01:05:35,650 --> 01:05:36,940
Yeah.

626
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,610
When?

627
01:05:40,650 --> 01:05:42,280
Plug his wound.

628
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,740
That's the main LZ, but it's closed.

629
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:00,050
Go! Move!

630
01:06:02,510 --> 01:06:06,260
Go, Parker! Get up in there!
This is too Tall. I'm clear...

631
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:08,640
Crandall's clear...

632
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:15,230
Colonel!

633
01:06:15,310 --> 01:06:19,020
Go over and reinforce that
company! On that ridge there! Look!

634
01:06:19,070 --> 01:06:21,690
Yes, sir! Okay! Keep your head down!

635
01:06:24,200 --> 01:06:26,240
To the top of the ridge! Move it!

636
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:28,370
Come on, let's move! Move!

637
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:32,950
Run! Come on!

638
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:43,970
Captain Nadal, we've got to break
through to that cutoff platoon!

639
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:47,760
We got an American platoon out there.

640
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:50,810
An Air Cav platoon cut off out there!

641
01:06:50,890 --> 01:06:52,350
Air Cav!

642
01:06:53,310 --> 01:06:54,600
Garry Owen!

643
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:14,580
He said, "Really? Me
too." I said, "I know.

644
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,580
Your mama asked me to give you $600."

645
01:07:20,040 --> 01:07:21,630
Good luck to you.

646
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:28,890
Hey, you got enough room for one more?

647
01:07:29,970 --> 01:07:32,930
If you're crazy enough,
get in. Yes, sir.

648
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,240
Hey, what are those lights down there?

649
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:55,200
Enemy soldiers.

650
01:07:55,290 --> 01:07:57,250
They use candles on the trail.

651
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:00,670
They're moving into position to attack.

652
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,050
Here we go!

653
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:32,490
Unload that shit! Let's go,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

654
01:08:37,540 --> 01:08:40,620
You and your boys have done
a hell of a job today, Snake.

655
01:08:41,370 --> 01:08:46,000
It's the last flight for the
night, but you need us, you call us.

656
01:08:49,670 --> 01:08:52,640
Who in the hell are
you? I'm a reporter, sir.

657
01:08:53,590 --> 01:08:55,010
Yeah.

658
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:57,470
Joe Galloway, UPI.
How's it going, Colonel?

659
01:08:57,560 --> 01:09:00,940
We've been flat to the boards since
last night, and we're outnumbered.

660
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:05,900
More enemy coming too. I saw a chain
of lights coming down the mountain.

661
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:08,150
Is that so? Yes, sir.

662
01:09:08,230 --> 01:09:10,530
Well, I can't guarantee your safety.

663
01:09:10,610 --> 01:09:12,700
Yes, sir, I know.

664
01:09:12,780 --> 01:09:15,740
Where you from, son?
Refugio, Texas, sir.

665
01:09:15,830 --> 01:09:19,120
Well, that's the first thing I
heard all day that makes any sense.

666
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:22,620
Captain, you see those lights coming
down the trails on the mountain?

667
01:09:22,710 --> 01:09:25,710
On it right now, sir. You
fry them sons of bitches.

668
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:27,670
Whiskey-Six, this is
Trojan-Three. Fire mission.

669
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:31,720
Tango Foxtrot:
4-niner-6-5-6-niner.

670
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,390
All operations are
suspended for the evening.

671
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,150
Morning operations will be
scheduled for 0530 hours.

672
01:10:16,140 --> 01:10:17,260
Where's Crandall?

673
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,890
Where's Crandall? He's right there, sir.

674
01:10:21,140 --> 01:10:23,430
You led my men into a hot LZ.

675
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,190
Somebody had to fly out the wounded.

676
01:10:25,270 --> 01:10:28,150
Don't you play hotshot
with me. You know the rules.

677
01:10:28,230 --> 01:10:30,940
You suckered us in there. Do
it again, I'll have you busted!

678
01:10:30,980 --> 01:10:34,950
You got the balls to face me, but
not the balls to face the enemy?

679
01:10:36,030 --> 01:10:37,950
Get outta here. Whoa!

680
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:40,740
I ever see you again, I'll kill you.

681
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,000
That's right.

682
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:56,630
Quite a day, huh?

683
01:11:01,970 --> 01:11:03,930
Tomorrow will be worse.

684
01:11:06,810 --> 01:11:09,480
If they make it to tomorrow.

685
01:11:19,370 --> 01:11:22,290
Ernie, it's pitch black. I can't
see anything, but I can smell 'em.

686
01:11:23,410 --> 01:11:25,080
Dead bodies stink, Bungum.

687
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:28,540
No, it's not the dead ones. I
can smell them crawling up on us.

688
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:31,540
I'm telling you.

689
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:40,300
I need illumination,
6-5-0, 1-5-0.

690
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,910
I need artillery on
previously established targets!

691
01:12:00,990 --> 01:12:04,330
Alpha, Bravo and
Charlie! Fire for effect!

692
01:12:04,370 --> 01:12:06,330
Fire for effect!

693
01:12:08,790 --> 01:12:11,880
Save your ammo! Cease fire!

694
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,050
Is anybody hit?

695
01:12:16,090 --> 01:12:19,380
Captain, if you guys are
coming you gotta let us know.

696
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:22,390
It's pitch black out here. I don't
wanna shoot any of our own guys.

697
01:12:24,470 --> 01:12:25,890
Savage...

698
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,100
we can't make it tonight.

699
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,520
Don't worry. You're gonna make it.

700
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,780
We'll come get you in the morning.

701
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:41,990
Yes, sir.

702
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:44,740
Out.

703
01:13:39,130 --> 01:13:41,300
You're doing a fine job, son.

704
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:44,890
Don't worry. We gave them
more than they gave us today.

705
01:13:45,640 --> 01:13:47,560
How you boys doing? Fine, sir.

706
01:13:47,640 --> 01:13:50,730
You keep doing what you're
doing, we'll be fine.

707
01:13:51,810 --> 01:13:55,690
Your men have done a hell of a
job today, Lieutenant Geoghegan.

708
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:58,520
They won't get through us,
sir. You can count on it.

709
01:13:58,610 --> 01:14:00,280
I know that, Jack.

710
01:14:00,360 --> 01:14:01,780
Keep it up, son.

711
01:14:03,820 --> 01:14:06,070
It's Rear Headquarters, sir.

712
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:07,490
How is it out there, Colonel?

713
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,740
We're surrounded, but
we're holding on, sir.

714
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:14,830
Sir, I need a confirmed
count of our dead and wounded.

715
01:14:14,920 --> 01:14:17,460
I got to know where all my boys are.

716
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,750
You'll get it, Hal.

717
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,050
Here they come.

718
01:14:24,130 --> 01:14:25,340
Captain Edwards.

719
01:14:27,180 --> 01:14:28,510
We need illumination on the perimeter.

720
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,720
Whiskey-Five, this
is Hot Wire-Six-Alpha.

721
01:14:30,810 --> 01:14:33,480
We need illumination now.

722
01:15:09,470 --> 01:15:10,930
Kathy?

723
01:15:28,700 --> 01:15:29,740
A telegram.

724
01:15:30,530 --> 01:15:33,580
A cab delivers a telegram.

725
01:15:33,660 --> 01:15:36,790
"The Secretary of the Army...

726
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:39,540
regrets..."

727
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,940
Mrs. Moore?

728
01:16:40,020 --> 01:16:41,940
Colonel Moore's wife?

729
01:16:44,230 --> 01:16:45,360
Yes.

730
01:16:47,070 --> 01:16:49,530
I need help finding an address.

731
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:53,200
I'm looking for... You jackass!

732
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:57,700
Do you know what this is? Do
you know what you just did to me?

733
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:12,590
I don't like this job, ma'am.

734
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,930
I'm just trying to do it.

735
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:21,560
Wait.

736
01:17:22,480 --> 01:17:23,940
Wait.

737
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:29,110
I'll take it to her.

738
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,500
And tell the cab company, if there
are any others, just bring them to me.

739
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:52,550
Julie.

740
01:17:52,630 --> 01:17:54,890
I just went by to see Catherine.

741
01:17:54,970 --> 01:17:56,390
Everybody knows.

742
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:00,060
No chaplains or counselors? Cab drivers?

743
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,060
The Army wasn't ready.

744
01:18:04,900 --> 01:18:07,270
I'll go with you.

745
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,280
Thanks. Who's it for?

746
01:18:51,690 --> 01:18:53,610
I thought she would hate me.

747
01:18:55,110 --> 01:18:57,660
Your husband didn't start the war.

748
01:18:57,740 --> 01:19:00,660
They all knew this could
happen, and so did we.

749
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,520
I'll take care of this.

750
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,520
I'll go with you.

751
01:19:29,480 --> 01:19:32,070
We'll do one at a time. Okay?

752
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:34,690
We won't look.

753
01:19:34,780 --> 01:19:36,200
Okay.

754
01:20:32,250 --> 01:20:34,050
Julie...

755
01:20:34,130 --> 01:20:37,050
do you think there'll be
more telegrams tomorrow?

756
01:20:40,550 --> 01:20:43,010
If there are, come and get me.

757
01:21:03,030 --> 01:21:06,490
In the name of the Father, the
Son and the Holy Ghost, amen.

758
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:11,580
Out of the depths I
cry unto Thee, O Lord.

759
01:21:11,620 --> 01:21:13,580
Lord, hear my voice.

760
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:19,340
Let Thine ears be attentive to
the voice of my supplications.

761
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:22,130
Thou, O Lord, shall mark our inequities.

762
01:21:23,890 --> 01:21:25,810
Lord, who can abide them?

763
01:21:28,850 --> 01:21:30,770
With Thee there is mercy.

764
01:21:33,230 --> 01:21:35,820
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord...

765
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,320
and may perpetual light shine upon them.

766
01:21:39,650 --> 01:21:43,780
And through the mercy of God,
may they rest in peace. Amen.

767
01:21:43,870 --> 01:21:46,830
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

768
01:21:53,460 --> 01:21:55,880
Do you got a death wish, Galloway?

769
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:58,000
No, sir.

770
01:21:58,090 --> 01:22:00,010
Well, then why are you here?

771
01:22:04,510 --> 01:22:06,850
'Cause I knew these dead
boys would be here, sir.

772
01:22:15,730 --> 01:22:17,860
Why aren't you a soldier?

773
01:22:17,980 --> 01:22:19,860
You got the guts for it.

774
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:21,900
My daddy was a soldier.

775
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:26,120
My granddaddy, two of my
great-granddaddies was soldiers.

776
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:28,080
Hell, that's how I came to be.

777
01:22:28,870 --> 01:22:31,620
Each of them lost a
leg in the Civil War.

778
01:22:31,660 --> 01:22:34,290
My Great-granddaddy
Galloway, he lost his left...

779
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:37,290
and my Great-granddaddy
Reid lost his right.

780
01:22:38,750 --> 01:22:41,710
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.

781
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:45,050
Every year after that, same date,
same store, they'd get together...

782
01:22:45,130 --> 01:22:48,050
and pick out a new pair of
shoes for the two of them.

783
01:22:48,140 --> 01:22:50,060
You are shittin' me. No, sir.

784
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,560
I swear to God.

785
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:56,690
Anyway, one had a daughter, one
had a son... my grandparents.

786
01:22:56,770 --> 01:23:00,190
What do you suppose the odds of
them having the same shoe size was?

787
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,780
I don't know, Colonel. It
was meant to be, I guess.

788
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:07,280
Yeah.

789
01:23:08,530 --> 01:23:09,950
Meant to be.

790
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:15,580
Sir, Galloways have been in every
war this country's ever fought.

791
01:23:15,670 --> 01:23:20,090
But when it came to this one, I
didn't think I could stop the war.

792
01:23:21,210 --> 01:23:24,010
I just thought maybe I
might try and understand one.

793
01:23:25,090 --> 01:23:28,220
Maybe help folks back home understand.

794
01:23:30,850 --> 01:23:33,350
I just figure I could do that better...

795
01:23:33,430 --> 01:23:36,100
shooting a camera than
I could shooting a rifle.

796
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:40,940
Well...

797
01:23:43,190 --> 01:23:46,150
I sure hope you make
it through this one.

798
01:23:46,200 --> 01:23:47,660
You too, Colonel.

799
01:25:41,270 --> 01:25:43,190
Right 20!

800
01:25:59,700 --> 01:26:01,790
Put it right on 'em!

801
01:27:17,820 --> 01:27:19,280
Colonel, sir.

802
01:27:21,540 --> 01:27:23,870
Captain Nadal. Sir.

803
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,290
What is it, sir?

804
01:27:30,380 --> 01:27:32,460
Nothing's wrong, except
there's nothing wrong.

805
01:27:38,890 --> 01:27:42,140
Best get back to the termite
mound. You'll be fine. Go on.

806
01:27:42,180 --> 01:27:44,180
Roger that, sir. Come on!

807
01:27:44,270 --> 01:27:46,440
All right, pass the word on.

808
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,440
Every man fire three rounds at
anything that looks suspicious.

809
01:27:50,520 --> 01:27:51,940
On my signal.

810
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:17,550
They're gonna hit us like
this along the whole perimeter.

811
01:28:17,630 --> 01:28:19,590
We gotta get back to that termite mound.

812
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,930
Better hang here, sir!

813
01:28:22,310 --> 01:28:23,760
Shit.

814
01:28:27,520 --> 01:28:29,190
We need a medic!

815
01:28:35,820 --> 01:28:37,610
Sir! Sir!

816
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:39,950
Captain Edwards, Charlie
Company, on the ridge.

817
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:41,490
Bob.

818
01:28:41,530 --> 01:28:43,120
They're inside the artillery!

819
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:44,580
I need...

820
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:13,940
I need a grenade!

821
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:28,200
Go, Willie! Come on, let's go!

822
01:29:33,880 --> 01:29:35,420
Godboldt down!

823
01:29:38,920 --> 01:29:40,090
I'll get him!

824
01:29:47,350 --> 01:29:48,770
Willie!

825
01:30:03,660 --> 01:30:05,030
Get those guys help!

826
01:30:05,120 --> 01:30:09,870
Captain Dillon, get Bravo Company
to send a platoon across the LZ...

827
01:30:09,950 --> 01:30:12,040
and support Charlie Company.

828
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,710
Bravo-Six, this
is Trojan-Three.

829
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:17,960
And tell Charlie Company to
get real small in their holes.

830
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:20,880
I'm gonna drop some
artillery right on top of'em!

831
01:30:20,970 --> 01:30:22,220
Charlie Company, get small.

832
01:30:22,300 --> 01:30:24,890
We got AT coming right
on top of your position.

833
01:30:24,970 --> 01:30:26,680
We're being overrun!

834
01:30:26,760 --> 01:30:29,390
Nah, boys! We're gonna win this fight.

835
01:31:15,850 --> 01:31:19,980
Yes, sir, they brought a main force
of VC battalion against us too.

836
01:31:20,070 --> 01:31:23,030
Colonel, I request you dispatch
another company of reinforcements...

837
01:31:23,110 --> 01:31:27,110
for movement as soon as it can be
accomplished without undue risk.

838
01:31:27,200 --> 01:31:29,660
Done. How bad is it, Hal?

839
01:31:34,620 --> 01:31:36,830
It's getting pretty
sporty down here, sir.

840
01:31:39,250 --> 01:31:41,340
Get out of the way!

841
01:31:50,810 --> 01:31:53,310
Medic! Get a medic over here!

842
01:31:57,730 --> 01:32:01,070
What's your name,
soldier? Jimmy Nakayama.

843
01:32:01,150 --> 01:32:03,070
I got a baby being born today.

844
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,360
Oh, wow! Congratulations! Thanks!

845
01:32:10,030 --> 01:32:11,410
Medic!

846
01:32:11,490 --> 01:32:13,660
Medic!

847
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,750
Can't take no pictures
lying down there, sonny.

848
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:23,750
Down, right there.

849
01:32:28,630 --> 01:32:30,430
I'm a noncombatant, sir.

850
01:32:30,510 --> 01:32:32,560
Ain't no such thing today, boy.

851
01:32:37,310 --> 01:32:38,560
Shit.

852
01:32:40,650 --> 01:32:42,770
Why aren't those mortars firing?

853
01:32:42,820 --> 01:32:44,900
What's the problem here?

854
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:46,400
These tubes are red hot, sir.

855
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:49,200
I'm afraid we're gonna cook a
round off and blow us all up.

856
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:52,200
We can't cool 'em off 'cause
we're all out of water.

857
01:32:58,410 --> 01:33:00,500
Come on! What are you waiting for?

858
01:33:00,540 --> 01:33:02,460
Jimmy, come on.

859
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,380
Go, go, go.

860
01:33:05,420 --> 01:33:07,720
Yeah, one more.

861
01:33:29,400 --> 01:33:31,110
Gentlemen...

862
01:33:31,200 --> 01:33:33,240
prepare to defend yourselves.

863
01:33:43,540 --> 01:33:44,750
Grenade!

864
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,430
Negative! Negative! Stand by!

865
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:39,640
My pilots do not see the enemy.
They cannot pick out our friendlies.

866
01:34:39,720 --> 01:34:41,350
Bravo-Six, say again.

867
01:34:41,430 --> 01:34:44,690
You gotta tell your company
commander to pop smoke now.

868
01:34:44,730 --> 01:34:48,110
They need to mark the
lines now! We have no lines!

869
01:34:48,150 --> 01:34:51,400
We have enemies and friendlies
mixed in all over the place.

870
01:34:51,490 --> 01:34:53,450
Sir, our perimeter is collapsing.

871
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:55,780
Alpha Company and Bravo
Company cannot hold.

872
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,780
Charlie Company is being overrun.

873
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:02,710
Net call! Net call!

874
01:35:02,790 --> 01:35:04,710
Keep this net clear!

875
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,060
Hastings!

876
01:35:26,190 --> 01:35:27,730
Broken arrow!

877
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,570
Broken arrow!

878
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:35,740
I say again! Broken arrow!

879
01:35:35,820 --> 01:35:37,910
We have broken arrow!
We have broken arrow!

880
01:35:37,990 --> 01:35:39,490
Confirm. Broken arrow.

881
01:35:39,530 --> 01:35:41,450
Broken arrow confirmed.

882
01:35:41,490 --> 01:35:42,660
Broken arrow?

883
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,830
That means that an American
unit has been overrun.

884
01:35:44,870 --> 01:35:47,670
It calls in every combat
aircraft for support.

885
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:50,840
My God, there's no hiding it now.

886
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:14,860
Charlie Company, report! Signal is out!

887
01:36:14,860 --> 01:36:17,070
Bravo Company, report!

888
01:36:17,150 --> 01:36:21,120
Roger that! Planes are
on their way, Colonel!

889
01:36:21,950 --> 01:36:23,080
Sir!

890
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:28,540
Roger that!

891
01:36:39,640 --> 01:36:42,050
We have planes at every 1,000 feet...

892
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:45,140
from 7,000 to 35,000...
we'll get 'em, sir!

893
01:36:47,230 --> 01:36:50,610
Advancing north on
our position at 1-5-0.

894
01:37:08,750 --> 01:37:11,000

Nine-six-two-five-zero-seven--

895
01:37:18,420 --> 01:37:21,300
They're getting closer
in on 3-1-5 degrees!

896
01:37:21,340 --> 01:37:25,180
That's 0-5-0!
Repeat, 0-5-0!

897
01:37:31,350 --> 01:37:32,730
Goddamn it.

898
01:37:44,410 --> 01:37:48,500
Company sighted out in the open,
advancing north on our position.

899
01:37:48,580 --> 01:37:51,870
They're advancing on
3-1-5 degrees at 1-5-0.

900
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:57,050
Bring it closer in on
3-1-5 degrees at 0-5-0...

901
01:37:57,130 --> 01:38:00,130
Charlie, call that son of a bitch off!

902
01:38:00,170 --> 01:38:02,180
Call an abort now!

903
01:38:02,260 --> 01:38:03,180
Pull up!

904
01:38:05,470 --> 01:38:07,220
Get down!

905
01:38:34,330 --> 01:38:37,040
Charlie, listen to me.
You're keeping us alive now.

906
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:40,050
You forget about that one
and you keep 'em coming in.

907
01:38:40,130 --> 01:38:41,720
You're doing well, son.

908
01:38:44,180 --> 01:38:46,180

Seven-oh-two...

909
01:38:46,220 --> 01:38:48,220
Attack against the tree line.

910
01:38:59,150 --> 01:39:01,820
Medic! Medic!

911
01:39:16,500 --> 01:39:19,630
Oh, God! Jimmy. You know this guy?

912
01:39:19,670 --> 01:39:21,840
You know him? Talk to
him. Just talk to him!

913
01:39:22,670 --> 01:39:24,630
Jimmy, do you hear me?

914
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,890
It's Joe. It's Joe Galloway.

915
01:39:26,970 --> 01:39:30,310
Doc's giving you morphine.
We're gonna get you out of here.

916
01:39:36,940 --> 01:39:39,940
We gotta get him to the
landing zone. Grab his legs!

917
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:55,040
You gotta get him out of here. Hey! Hey!

918
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:58,040
I can't help you! You
gotta do it by yourself!

919
01:39:58,130 --> 01:40:00,670
Get him on that chopper, okay? Yes, sir.

920
01:40:59,690 --> 01:41:02,060
Tell my wife I love her...

921
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:04,230
and my baby!

922
01:41:04,320 --> 01:41:06,780
You tell'em!

923
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:34,410
Captain Nadal. Sir...

924
01:42:34,490 --> 01:42:37,030
Now that we put 'em back on
their heels, we got us a lull.

925
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,450
I want you to attack.

926
01:42:38,540 --> 01:42:41,290
I want you to go over there
and rescue that cut off platoon.

927
01:42:41,370 --> 01:42:44,460
Yes, sir! First Squad, move out!

928
01:42:46,130 --> 01:42:48,380
Come on, guys. Move it!

929
01:42:52,630 --> 01:42:53,930
Add fifty.

930
01:42:54,550 --> 01:42:56,550
Keep moving the artillery forward!

931
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:58,970
Keep walking the artillery forward!

932
01:42:59,060 --> 01:43:00,140
Spread it out!

933
01:43:04,060 --> 01:43:06,190
Move it!

934
01:43:08,650 --> 01:43:11,440
Move it! Keep moving forward!

935
01:43:27,380 --> 01:43:29,880
Sergeant Savage, you guys still here?

936
01:43:48,360 --> 01:43:51,030
We have 40 KIA, we have two MIA.

937
01:43:51,110 --> 01:43:53,030
These are the latest numbers. Over.

938
01:44:22,850 --> 01:44:26,480
That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage.

939
01:44:34,490 --> 01:44:37,530
Forty dead, two unaccounted for, sir.

940
01:44:37,610 --> 01:44:39,450
Right.

941
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:43,200
All right, boys, let's
get 'em up and get 'em out.

942
01:44:52,000 --> 01:44:54,920
Let's get 'em out of here
and get 'em on the chopper!

943
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:00,640
Since most of the men being
loaded on the chopper...

944
01:45:00,720 --> 01:45:02,100
are from Charlie Company...

945
01:45:02,140 --> 01:45:03,680
I want you to take their place.

946
01:45:03,760 --> 01:45:07,480
I'll show you where. Follow
me. Yes, sir! Let's go!

947
01:46:05,330 --> 01:46:07,870
Captain, have your men
dig some firing steps.

948
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:10,120
Throw some dirt on those
bodies, keep the smell down.

949
01:46:10,210 --> 01:46:12,080
Roger, Sergeant Major.

950
01:46:12,170 --> 01:46:16,300
Kind of makes you wish you'd
signed up for submarines, don't it?

951
01:46:16,380 --> 01:46:20,880
Brigade headquarters wants you
out on the first chopper at dawn.

952
01:46:20,970 --> 01:46:24,600
What idiot would keep ordering that
in the middle of a goddamn battle?

953
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:27,640
Gen. Westmoreland wants a
briefing. Give me the horn.

954
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:30,180
I am in a fight...

955
01:46:30,270 --> 01:46:33,190
and I object to this
order to return to Saigon.

956
01:46:33,270 --> 01:46:35,440
Now, I will not leave my men.

957
01:46:35,480 --> 01:46:37,480
Is that clear? Out.

958
01:46:45,070 --> 01:46:46,990
There's two of my men
unaccounted for out there...

959
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,000
and it's where the worst
of the fighting was...

960
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,870
so they'll be out there someplace.

961
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,750
Let's go out and get
'em. I'm with you, sir.

962
01:46:53,790 --> 01:46:55,290
All right.

963
01:46:55,380 --> 01:46:56,880
Let's go.

964
01:48:50,030 --> 01:48:51,990
They...

965
01:48:52,080 --> 01:48:53,740
brought another...

966
01:48:53,830 --> 01:48:55,910
Oh, God, Julie. Julie, it's yours.

967
01:49:44,050 --> 01:49:46,380
He died keeping my promise.

968
01:50:17,410 --> 01:50:19,370
Sir, they're ordering us all out.

969
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:21,830
All of us.

970
01:50:21,870 --> 01:50:24,250
They're gonna march reinforcements in.

971
01:50:24,290 --> 01:50:26,800
They don't understand
a damn thing, do they?

972
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:29,130
Can't get out.

973
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:34,550
He's waiting up there in a
cave, and that's what he wants.

974
01:50:34,640 --> 01:50:36,810
The minute he sees live soldiers
hopping on a helicopter...

975
01:50:36,890 --> 01:50:39,730
he'll be all over us and
then he'll get what he wants.

976
01:50:39,770 --> 01:50:42,060
He'll get his massacre.

977
01:50:50,650 --> 01:50:53,320
Requesting permission
to rejoin the lines, sir.

978
01:50:57,080 --> 01:50:58,790
All right, son.

979
01:51:02,870 --> 01:51:04,920
Garry Owen, sir.

980
01:51:27,520 --> 01:51:30,280
I wonder what was going through
Custer's mind when he realized...

981
01:51:30,360 --> 01:51:32,650
he'd led his men into a slaughter.

982
01:51:34,320 --> 01:51:37,070
Sir, Custer was a pussy.

983
01:51:39,080 --> 01:51:40,830
You ain't.

984
01:51:43,710 --> 01:51:45,330
Goddamn.

985
01:51:50,420 --> 01:51:51,880
Hell.

986
01:51:55,380 --> 01:51:57,550
Right now they're planning
their final attack...

987
01:51:57,640 --> 01:51:59,720
the one that will finish us off.

988
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:03,060
They'll nibble at us all night, then...

989
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:06,150
come dawn they'll hit us
with everything they got.

990
01:52:07,690 --> 01:52:10,270
That's what I'd do if I was him.

991
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:18,950
Sergeant Major, hand out
the last of the ammunition.

992
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:20,950
Yes, sir.

993
01:53:41,820 --> 01:53:43,240
Fix bayonets.

994
01:58:01,000 --> 01:58:03,540
You were wondering how Custer felt, sir.

995
01:58:05,170 --> 01:58:06,760
You ought to ask him.

996
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:27,100
Sergeant Savage!

997
02:00:35,780 --> 02:00:38,070
Checking the dead
enemies for documents...

998
02:00:38,160 --> 02:00:40,700
and I found this on the guy
that tried to bayonet you.

999
02:00:40,740 --> 02:00:43,370
Translated some of it, mostly personal.

1000
02:00:43,450 --> 02:00:46,040
Thought you might
wanna have a look at it.

1001
02:01:18,070 --> 02:01:20,830
What was that? It's American artillery.

1002
02:01:23,580 --> 02:01:25,370
Friendly fire.

1003
02:01:25,450 --> 02:01:27,370
How many casualties?

1004
02:01:29,630 --> 02:01:32,250
What the hell happened here, Joe?

1005
02:01:36,920 --> 02:01:38,510
Hey, Joe.

1006
02:01:40,260 --> 02:01:42,310
Colonel Moore!

1007
02:01:44,720 --> 02:01:46,980
Colonel! Colonel Moore!

1008
02:01:50,020 --> 02:01:52,570
What is the key to your victory?
Sir, tell us how you feel.

1009
02:01:52,650 --> 02:01:54,820
Do you feel the States will be forced...

1010
02:01:54,900 --> 02:01:56,860
to take the North
Vietnamese more seriously?

1011
02:01:56,860 --> 02:01:59,860
How do you feel about
the loss of your men, sir?

1012
02:01:59,950 --> 02:02:02,700
Have you notified the families, sir?

1013
02:03:17,940 --> 02:03:19,860
I'm glad you made it, son.

1014
02:03:20,990 --> 02:03:23,320
Thank you, sir. You too.

1015
02:03:28,200 --> 02:03:30,250
I'll never forgive myself.

1016
02:03:32,620 --> 02:03:34,380
For what, sir?

1017
02:03:39,380 --> 02:03:41,300
That my men...

1018
02:03:45,140 --> 02:03:47,640
That my men died and I didn't.

1019
02:04:09,910 --> 02:04:12,080
Sir, I don't...

1020
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:14,830
I don't know how to tell this story.

1021
02:04:16,170 --> 02:04:18,460
Well, you got to, Joe.

1022
02:04:20,340 --> 02:04:23,220
You tell the American people
what these men did here.

1023
02:04:27,930 --> 02:04:30,180
You tell 'em how my troopers died.

1024
02:04:36,810 --> 02:04:38,400
Yes, sir.

1025
02:04:42,940 --> 02:04:44,570
Thank you.

1026
02:05:32,620 --> 02:05:35,660
All of our men, living and
dead, are off the field, sir.

1027
02:05:35,750 --> 02:05:37,670
Well done, Sergeant Major.

1028
02:07:34,990 --> 02:07:38,160
In Saigon, Hal Moore's
superiors congratulated him...

1029
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:41,160
for killing over 1,800 enemy soldiers.

1030
02:07:42,460 --> 02:07:44,880
Then ordered him to lead
the men of the 7th Cavalry...

1031
02:07:44,920 --> 02:07:47,340
back into the Valley of Death.

1032
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:49,300
He led them...

1033
02:07:49,380 --> 02:07:51,510
and fought beside them...

1034
02:07:51,550 --> 02:07:54,180
for 235 more days.

1035
02:08:16,030 --> 02:08:18,950
Kids, go to bed. Isn't
there someone at the door?

1036
02:08:19,040 --> 02:08:21,200
Go to bed!

1037
02:09:01,450 --> 02:09:04,790
Children, your daddy's home! Daddy!

1038
02:09:10,800 --> 02:09:13,710
Some had families waiting.

1039
02:09:13,800 --> 02:09:17,510
For others, their only family
would be the men they bled beside.

1040
02:09:17,590 --> 02:09:21,510
There were no bands, no flags...

1041
02:09:21,600 --> 02:09:24,180
no honor guards to welcome them home.

1042
02:09:25,430 --> 02:09:28,940
They went to war because
their country ordered them to.

1043
02:09:29,020 --> 02:09:32,020
But in the end they fought not
for their country or their flag.

1044
02:09:33,480 --> 02:09:35,780
They fought for each other...

1045
02:09:39,620 --> 02:09:41,330
Dear Barbara...

1046
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:46,410
I have no words to express to you
my sadness of the loss of Jack.

1047
02:09:47,750 --> 02:09:50,250
The world is a lesser place without him.

1048
02:09:51,340 --> 02:09:54,010
But I know he is with
God and the angels.

1049
02:09:54,090 --> 02:09:57,930
And even heaven is improved
by his presence there.

1050
02:09:59,390 --> 02:10:01,510
I know you, too, are sure of this...

1051
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:05,180
and yet this knowledge
can't diminish his loss...

1052
02:10:05,270 --> 02:10:07,140
and your grief.

1053
02:10:08,190 --> 02:10:11,480
With abiding respect
and affection, Hal Moore.

1054
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:26,790
We who have seen war...

1055
02:10:26,870 --> 02:10:29,120
will never stop seeing it.

1056
02:10:31,790 --> 02:10:35,590
In the silence of the night,
we will always hear the screams.

1057
02:10:39,760 --> 02:10:42,010
So this is our story...

1058
02:10:43,510 --> 02:10:46,220
for we were soldiers once...

1059
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:48,230
and young.
