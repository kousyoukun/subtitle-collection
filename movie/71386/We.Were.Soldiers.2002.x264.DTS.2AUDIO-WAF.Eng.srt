1
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:35,220
See anything?

2
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:39,224
No, Captain.

3
00:01:39,308 --> 00:01:41,226
Fucking grass...

4
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,228
Fucking heat...

5
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,230
Fucking country...

6
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:20,200
Do we take prisoners?

7
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,204
No. Kill all they send...

8
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,206
...and they will stop coming.

9
00:45:50,125 --> 00:45:54,087
The helicopter soldiers
are coming!

10
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:57,132
Get them ready!

11
00:46:23,158 --> 00:46:26,119
10:48 A.M.
Landing Zone X-Ray

12
00:51:38,223 --> 00:51:40,100
1:15 P.M.
The Knoll.

13
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,183
Shift immediately to
their flanks.

14
00:52:21,266 --> 00:52:23,143
Do not let them breathe!

15
00:55:00,133 --> 00:55:03,136
They are using artillery
as a shield!

16
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:05,138
lt is accurate, and continuous.

17
00:55:05,222 --> 00:55:09,142
We must overrun them now,
when they are at their weakest!

18
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,144
Attack here...

19
00:55:12,145 --> 00:55:14,147
...here, and here!

20
00:55:16,149 --> 00:55:19,152
Overwhelm the landing zone...

21
00:55:19,236 --> 00:55:21,154
...and we have choked
their route...

22
00:55:21,238 --> 00:55:23,156
...of supply and escape!

23
00:57:14,142 --> 00:57:16,103
Have we broken through?

24
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:18,105
The Americans just
landed another...

25
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:20,107
...wave of reinforcements.

26
00:57:21,149 --> 00:57:24,111
They massed precisely...

27
00:57:24,236 --> 00:57:26,113
...where we attacked

28
00:57:26,238 --> 00:57:28,073
Use the creek bed.

29
00:57:42,171 --> 00:57:44,089
2:27 P.M.
The Creek Bed

01:12:59,171 --> 01:13:01,131
2:23 A.M. - The Ridge

32
01:23:56,161 --> 01:24:00,123
We fought well today.

33
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:15,138
We tested their tactics...

34
01:24:15,222 --> 01:24:17,140
...and learned their
capabilities.

35
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:21,144
Their artillery is effective...

36
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:24,147
...so we must get so close...

37
01:24:24,231 --> 01:24:28,068
...they can't use it.

38
01:24:29,111 --> 01:24:36,076
We will grab them by the
belt buckle.

39
01:26:51,128 --> 01:26:54,089
For the courage of those
who have died...

40
01:26:55,132 --> 01:26:57,092
For those who are
about to die...

41
01:26:57,217 --> 01:27:00,095
l am grateful.

42
01:27:02,139 --> 01:27:02,764
6:09 A.M.
The Creek Bed

43
01:28:50,122 --> 01:28:52,082
7:15 A.M. - The Ridge

44
01:33:47,127 --> 01:33:49,129
We are through their lines
on all sides.

45
01:34:29,127 --> 01:34:32,089
Congratulations, Colonel.
You have beaten the Americans.

46
01:52:25,412 --> 01:52:28,373
Use the darkness to move
into position...

47
01:52:28,457 --> 01:52:30,375
...and l will bring up
our reserves.

48
01:52:31,418 --> 01:52:33,378
We will overwhelm
them at dawn...

49
01:52:33,462 --> 01:52:35,380
...before they are ready.

50
01:53:15,379 --> 01:53:16,630
5:57 A.M. The Third Day

51
01:53:41,405 --> 01:53:43,365
Fix bayonets.

52
01:58:13,343 --> 01:58:16,305
The Americans have
broken through our lines.

53
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:19,308
We have no soldiers
between them...

54
01:58:19,433 --> 01:58:21,310
...and our command post.

55
02:06:42,394 --> 02:06:44,354
Such a tragedy.

56
02:06:45,397 --> 02:06:47,357
They will think this was
their victory.

57
02:06:49,318 --> 02:06:51,278
So this will become an...

58
02:06:51,403 --> 02:06:53,280
...American war.

59
02:06:54,323 --> 02:06:56,283
And the end will be the same...

60
02:06:57,326 --> 02:06:59,286
...except for the numbers who...

61
02:07:00,329 --> 02:07:02,289
...will die before we get there.
