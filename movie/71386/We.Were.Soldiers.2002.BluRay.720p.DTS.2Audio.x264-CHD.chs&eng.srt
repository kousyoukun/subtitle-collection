1
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,720
这是1965 年十一月发生的真实故事
These are the true events of November, 1965

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,340
越南的德浪山谷
The la Drang Valley of Vietnam

3
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,010
一个我们国家遗忘的地方
a place our country does not remember...

4
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,520
一场它所不了解的战争
in a war it does not understand.

5
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,060
这个故事是那些年轻美国人的一份遗嘱
This story's a testament to the young Americans...

6
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,060
他们死在死亡山谷中
who died in the Valley of Death...

7
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,570
也是对越南军队中那些年轻人的纪念
and a tribute to the young men of the Peoples Army of Vietnam...

8
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,570
他们在那个地方死在我们手里
who died by our hand in that place.

9
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,820
这个故事,要从最初说起
To tell this story, I must start at the beginning.

10
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,540
但是它从哪里开始呢
But where does it begin?

11
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,500
也许是在1954年六月 当法国第100集团军
Maybe in June of 1954, when French Group Mobile 100...

12
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,420
搬进这个越南中央高地
moved into the same Central Highlands of Vietnam...

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,920
我们 11 年后要去的地方
where we would go 11 years later.

14
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,500
看到什么？

15
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
没有队长

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,500
该死的草丛

17
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,500
热得要命

18
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,500
该死的国家

19
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,460
[法语]

20
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,470
[越南语]

21
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:21,510
抓俘虏吗？

22
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:24,510
不全杀掉

23
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:28,510
他们就不会再入侵的

24
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,220
【我 们 曾 是 战 士】

25
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,600
也许故事该从美国说起
Maybe the story begins in America...

26
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,560
当军方开始意识到一种新的战争即将来临
when the army first realized a new kind of war was coming its way.

27
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,190
白宫希望开始战争而且
The White House anticipates a buildup and wants a victory...

28
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,190
取得一场胜利 对那些穿土布衣服的野蛮人
over cavemen in black pajamas.

29
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,820
如果不是他们打败了法国人 我们不会去那儿
We wouldn't be there if they hadn't already beaten the French Army.

30
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,830
法国的军队 那是什么
The French Army? What's that?

31
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,120
问题出在越南的地形，丛林 高山 大河
The problem in Vietnam is terrain jungles, mountains, rivers.

32
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,620
军队的梦魇
Maneuver's a nightmare.

33
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,040
我们有一个计划 使用直升飞机--在战斗中来去自如
We have a plan to use helicopters leap in and out of battle.

34
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,090
他们想要你来试验一下这个想法
They want you to run the test on the idea.

35
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,920
这需要一个厉害的指挥官
It'll take a hell of a combat leader.

36
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,470
我认识一个年轻上校Hal Moore
I know a young light colonel named Hal Moore.

37
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,470
他在朝鲜指挥过一次战役
He led a combat company in Korea.

38
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,220
在那之后，他自愿去测试实验降落伞
After that, he volunteered to test experimental parachutes.

39
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,930
实验降落伞? 听起来挺合适
Experimental parachutes? Sounds like just the guy.

40
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,440
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see

41
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,480
Was all that he could see Was all that he could see

42
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,650
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see

43
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,450
The bear went over the mountain The bear went over the mountain

44
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,950
The bear went over the mountain

45
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,620
我们接着 "Bingo"何如 你们说什么? "Bingo"
How about we go back to "Bingo"? What do you say? "Bingo".

46
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,880
B-I-N-G-O

47
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,590
B-I-N-G-O

48
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,670
B-I-N-G-O

49
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,130
Bingo是他的名字
And Bingo was his name-o

50
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,110
汤姆,关于我们新上校,你知道多少
Tom, how much you know about our new colonel?

51
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,780
他是在朝鲜
He was in Korea...

52
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,200
哈佛国际关系硕士学位
has a master's in international relations from Harvard.

53
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,740
哈佛? 他不是学院里的那些猫之一,是吗 
Harvard? He's not one of those academic pussies, is he?

54
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,240
Hal Moore?

55
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,460
想要我拿一个
Want me to get one of those?

56
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,550
加油,太高了 吉米你最好的发球
Come on, Too Tall. Gimme your best shot!

57
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,100
你看见那吗,运动迷 你看见那吗
Did you see that, sports fans? Did you see that?

58
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,680
Snakeshit drives that one to the moon, baby!

59
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,270
撞他
Hit the cutoff man! Hit the cutoff man!

60
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,520
来了
And he's coming around!

61
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,730
他来这里了 不是吧
- Here he comes! - No, he's not.

62
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,200
出局了
You're out! You're out!

63
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,530
难怪你不能飞 你看不到
Horseshit! No wonder you can't fly. You can't see.

64
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,910
我相信你挂了
I believe you're out.

65
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,880
- 你是飞行员? - 我太高了,sir
- You're a pilot? - Too Tall, sir.

66
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,840
- 是的,看得出 - 你呼叫,我们运送
- Yeah, I can see that. - You call, we haul.

67
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,560
- 能跟你谈谈吗,Crandall - 好的,sir
- Can I speak to you, Crandall? - Yes, sir.

68
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,730
- 出局 - 对了
- Out. - Safe.

69
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,850
- 出局 - 对了
- Out. - Safe.

70
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,690
- 请你喝一杯？ - 当然可以
- Can I buy you a drink? - Sure.

71
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,190
谢谢
Thanks.

72
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,490
你的人叫你 "Snakeshit" 
So, your men call you "Snakeshit".

73
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,240
那是弟兄们起的,sir
That's an affectionate appellation of my comrades-in-arms, sir...

74
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,370
因为我飞得比Snakeshit低
'cause I fly lower than snake shit.

75
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,410
我有个问题,Snakeshit,你来解决
Well, I got a problem, Snakeshit, and I think you're the solution.

76
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,040
我被叫做好多东西,上校,却从不是个解决
I've been called a lot of things, Colonel, never a solution.

77
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,670
你知道什么是空中骑兵
You know what air cavalry really means?

78
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,050
你飞入敌占区,离家10,000多里
You fly into hostile territory, outnumbered 10,000 miles from home.

79
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,300
有时战场比足球场还小
Sometimes the battleground's no bigger than a football field.

80
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,720
如果直升机不来,我们会被杀光
And if the choppers stop comin', we all get slaughtered.

81
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,720
我打赌飞行员不会因为陌生人飞过来
Now, I figure chopper pilots won't fly into hell for strangers...

82
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,310
我是Hal Moore
so... I'm Hal Moore.

83
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,480
我知道,sir 为什么是我们
I know, sir. Why us?

84
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,780
你们看起来像粪一样 但是你们的装备还好
Well, you guys look like shit, but your equipment is immaculate.

85
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,820
昨天是星期天，你不必训练，但你参加了
Yesterday was Sunday. You didn't have to be training, but you were.

86
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,740
你是飞行员了 像那个太高
You got pilots like that Too Tall character.

87
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,830
他超过了普通军队的标准
He's way outside the limits of army regs.

88
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,330
为什么他们愿意和你一起飞
They wanna fly with you for some reason.

89
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,330
我猜因为他们认为你是最好的
I guess it's 'cause they think you're the best.

90
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,960
因为我只是个新兵哑一些,sir
It's 'cause I only recruit the dumb ones, sir.

91
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,090
不 在所有这些中我有个选择
I don't suppose I have a choice in all this.

92
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,840
你当然不
You sure don't.

93
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,590
为了世界不要错过
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

94
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,140
为空中骑兵
To the Air Cav.

95
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,520
早上好,长官
Good mornin', Sergeant Major.

96
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,570
你知道今天是什么鬼日子？
How do you know what kind of goddamn day it is?

97
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,750
集合！立正！
Group! Atten-hut!

98
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,190
稍息,先生们
At ease, gentlemen.

99
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,030
欢迎加入新的骑兵队伍
Welcome to the new cavalry.

100
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,490
我们将会投入到战争
We will ride into battle.

101
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,780
这个... 将会是我们的坐骑
And this... will be our horse.

102
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,100
你不须捕捉它，喂它
You don't have to catch it. You don't have to feed it.

103
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,230
但是我要提醒你们
But I can assure you...

104
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,610
新的技术或者你的军衔
that neither the new technology nor your status as officers...

105
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,030
都不会让你免除危险
will keep you above the danger.

106
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,250
Plumley长官和我来自伞兵 
Sergeant-Major Plumley and I come from the paratroopers...

107
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,920
那里官员总是第一个跳出飞机
where the officer is always the first one out of the plane.

108
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,920
为了跟随你的本能
Because to follow your instincts...

109
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
激发你手下的斗志
and to inspire your men by your example...

110
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,930
和他们一起作战
you have to be with them where the metal meets the meat.

111
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,560
二战中Plumley长官指挥4个跳伞队
Sergeant-Major Plumley made all four combat jumps...

112
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,180
在第82空降师
in the 82nd Airborne during World War II.

113
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,350
西西里，沙伦劳，诺曼第
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy...

114
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,480
和荷兰，还有朝鲜
and Holland, plus one more in Korea.

115
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,490
他由我指挥
He answers to me and to me alone.

116
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,490
现在，我希望你们喜欢训练
Now, I hope you gentlemen like training...

117
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,910
因为我和长官
'cause me and the sergeant-major

118
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,080
我们爱它
we love it.

119
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,710
三次不到你不会被开除
Three strikes and you're not out!

120
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,710
总有一件让你能做更多的事
There is always one more thing you can do.

121
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,310
出发,男孩
Here we go, boys.

122
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,640
过去! 现在
Move! Move! Go! Now!

123
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,850

我们在外面这里
We're outta here!

126
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,440
很好,哼!? 很好
- Pretty good, huh? - Pretty good.

127
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,660
只有一件事是错的
There's only one thing wrong.

128
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,040
快，我们会是营里最好的排了

129
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,540
准备 出发
Be ready in there! Let's go! Let's go!

130
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,250
好了 首长死了
All right! Your officer's dead!

131
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,290
你该做什么?  第一
- What do you do? What do you do? - First

132
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,300
他犹豫 他死了，你做什么?
All right, he hesitated. He's dead. What do you do?

133
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,510
跳下飞机 下来
- Get off the chopper! - Get off the chopper.

134
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,020
抓住第三个
Hold off the third one.

135
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,640
继续
Come on in.

136
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,230
Savage,你向上级学习怎么做
Savage, you learn the job of the man above you...

137
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,650
再教你的手下
and you teach your job to the man below you in rank.

138
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,650
每个人都这样做
That goes for every man in this outfit.

139
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,320
明白? 是的,sir
- Understood? - Yes, sir!

140
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,030
我们将会在战场上着陆
We'll be landing under fire, gentlemen.

141
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,740
会没命的
Men will die.

142
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,750
你们有祷告过吗?
Have you said your prayers?

143
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,670
快点 我和你一起来
Come on. I'll say them with you.

144
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,840
下来 吉米，那只熊
- Fall in. - Gimme that bear.

145
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,470
好了吗 预备，开始
All right. Ready. Set.

146
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,940
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

147
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,190
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

148
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,150
Blessed art thou amongst women...

149
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,860
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

150
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,650
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners

151
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,700
Cecile,我听不到你祈祷,宝贝
Cecile, I don't hear you praying, honey.

152
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,870
我不想做天主教徒的 我想和妈咪一样，做Nethodist
I don't wanna be Catholic. I wanna be a "Nethodist" like Mommy.

153
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,830
你?
You do?

154
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,040
为什么呢?
And why is that, honey?

155
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,170
无论我想要什么我都能祈祷
So I can pray whatever I want.

156
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,380
那是罪
That's a sin.

157
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,380
不,那不是罪
No, that's not a sin.

158
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,630
上帝仅仅使你冷静，它不是罪
God just made you hardheaded. It's not a sin.

159
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,260
我来告诉你，你想
I'll tell you what. You wanna

160
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,810
你不为我们的家祈祷而且谢谢上帝?
You wanna pray and thank God for our family?

161
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,190
- 想,sir - 那很好，我们开始
- Yes, sir. - That's good. Let's do it.

162
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,810
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

163
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,980
Blessed art thou among women...

164
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,240
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

165
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,290
我能听到你笑 你知道,甚至在这里
I can hear you laughing, you know, even in here.

166
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,160
我不是笑,我是吃惊
I'm not laughing, I'm marveling.

167
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,500
吃惊?怎么了
Marveling? At what?

168
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,920
你能在你的孩子中找到顽固
That you can find stubbornness in your children...

169
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,550
我想它来自任何人，除了你
and think it comes from anybody but you.

170
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,050
是吗 嗯
- Yeah? - Mm-hmm.

171
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,890
我将给你一件事让你吃惊
I'll give you something to marvel at.

172
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,720
他是一个野性的男人
He's a wild man.

173
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,660
- 当我祈祷的时候 - 嗯
- When I pray - Mm-hmm.

174
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,160
无论我想要什麽
whatever I want

175
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,380
感谢上帝把你给了我
I thank God for you.

176
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,560
美丽的早晨,长官
Beautiful morning, Sergeant Major.

177
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,100
你是作什麽的,该死的气象预报员现在?
What are you, a fuckin' weatherman now?

178
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,480
看我为棒球运动员所找到的
Look what I found for the new baseball player.

179
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,940
- 送给我们另一串官员 - 哼
- Sent us another bunch of officers. - Uh-huh.

180
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,490
真正的绿色 必须训练了
Real green. Gotta train 'em up.

181
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,870
让我以为在新的部门
Makes me think I'm starting a new unit.

182
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,030
他们也送了新的来福枪，M-16
They sent new rifles too. The M-16.

183
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,080
那是相当好的武器
That's supposed to be a pretty good weapon.

184
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,080
许多塑料
Lots of plastic.

185
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,630
对我感觉像一只 BB 枪 相信我将只用手枪
Feels like a BB gun to me. Believe I'll stick with my pistol.

186
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,710
你认为我们会离敌人那么近?
You think we're gonna get close enough to the enemy to use that?

187
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,340
你想什么,sir?
What do you think, sir?

188
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,510
领袖要保持冷静
A leader must remain cool and calm.

189
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,470
并且他一定要学会不理睬爆炸
And second, he must learn to ignore explosions...

190
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,350
热浪和灰尘,受伤者的尖叫声
the heat and dust, the screams of the wounded.

191
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,020
这是战场上的常事 常事
This is normal on a battlefield. Normal!

192
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,870
Fortran,你需要拿队伍加强左边侧面
Fortran, you need to get a company over to reinforce the left flank.

193
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,540
- 那是来自哪里? - 那在越南，我们的顾问
- Where is that coming from? - That's our advisors in Vietnam.

194
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,540
新收音机收到的
The new radio's picking up atmospheric bounce.

195
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,110
当狂马是个婴孩的时候
When Crazy Horse was a baby...

196
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,740
他接受部落中每个女人哺乳
he nursed from the breast of every woman in the tribe.

197
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,290
苏人那样养他们的孩子
The Sioux raised their children that way.

198
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,790
战士们
Every warrior...

199
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,830
叫部落中每个女人"母亲"
called every woman in the tribe "mother".

200
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,340
每个比较年长的战士 他们称他为 "祖父" 
Every older warrior, they called him "grandfather".

201
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,630
所以他们打仗如同一个家庭
Now, the point here is that they fought as a family.

202
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,220
照顾你的人
Take care of your men.

203
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,260
教他们彼此照顾
Teach them to take care of each other.

204
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,270
因为当这个开始
'Cause when this starts...

205
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,230
每个人是我们拥有的
each other is all we're gonna have.

206
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,320
- 你调的那吗? - 是的,sir
- Did you tune that in? - Yes, sir.

207
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,660
不错 你做我的无线电技师
Well, that's fine. You're my radio operator.

208
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,740
你将会很好 你将会胜任的
You'll be fine. You'll work it out.

209
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,550
你们中的任何一个叫我爷爷
Any of you sons of bitches calls me Grandpa...

210
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,050
我会杀了他
I'll kill ya.

211
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,910
Godboldt,脱掉你的长靴
Godboldt, take your boots off.

212
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,740
继续
Go on.

213
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,500
每个人,脱掉你的长靴 每个人
Everybody, take your boots off. Everybody.

214
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,750
袜子
Socks too.

215
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,060
穿上新袜子
I want you to draw fresh socks from supply.

216
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,770
涂上药粉
Keep your feet dusted with powder.

217
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,940
每个人互相检查脚就像Godboldt和我一样
Everybody check each other's feet like Godboldt and me.

218
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,700
现在,那个年轻人像个领袖
Now, that young man's a leader.

219
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,370
是的,sir
Yes, sir.

220
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,660
其他人 那个大的,结实的
That other fella that big, strong one there

221
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,660
他想要赢得奖章
he wants to win medals.

222
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,840
为什么你落在后面?
Why were you in the back?

223
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,050
见鬼,为什么你最后?
Goddamn it, why were you in the back?

224
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,050
他很热心
He's eager.

225
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,970
女士们, 我很高兴你们今天在这里
Ladies, I'm really, really glad you're here today.

226
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,270
你们其中有些是新人，我们都是新到岗位
Some of you are new to the army and all of us are new to this post.

227
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,810
我们要利用我们的资源，解决我们的问题
I thought we'd pool our resources and cover questions we have.

228
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,110
我们从第一项开始-- 食物
So, why don't we start with item number one food.

229
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,610
哪里买东西最好?
Where's the best place to shop?

230
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,910
我试过Big star,它不错
Well, I tried Big Star, and it's okay.

231
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,120
但我经常买些没用的东西
But I keep thinking my water's gonna break right in the checkout aisle.

232
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,170
刚才是食品，现在第二项-- 洗衣
That takes care of food shopping. So, item number two laundry.

233
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,710
洗衣机不动了
The base washing machines don't work.

234
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,050
他们从沼泽执行完任务身上都是沙子
They're full of sand from the swamp missions.

235
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,800
我会注意那个
I'll take care of that.

236
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,890
- 我已经抱怨过了 - 我们将会去告诉将军
- I've already complained. - We'll just go to the general.

237
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,310
同时，镇上Laundromat挺好
In the meantime, the Laundromat in town's okay...

238
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,850
但是他们不让在机器上洗彩色的衣物
but they won't let you wash your colored things in their machines.

239
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,810
- 在公众的Laundromat? - 对我而言也不可能
- At a public Laundromat? - Didn't make sense to me either.

240
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,810
我告诉你,他们在窗户上有标示
I'm telling you, they have a sign right in the window...

241
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,190
说 "只能白色" 
says "Whites Only".

242
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,110
- 什么? - 他们意谓只能白人
- What? - They mean white people only.

243
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,410
太可怕了
That's awful.

244
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,410
你的丈夫穿着军装
Your husband is wearing the uniform of a country that allows a place...

245
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,040
这里的洗衣店却说他不能用,当他可以为之而死--
to say his laundry's not good enough, when he could die for

246
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,340
- 对不起，我只是-- - 没关系，亲爱的
- I'm sorry. I just - That's all right, honey.

247
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,260
我知道我丈夫为何而战，我很骄傲
I know what my husband's fighting for, and that's why I can smile.

248
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,850
我丈夫从不要求得到尊重
My husband will never ask for respect...

249
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,060
他只会尊重像他一样的人
and he'll give respect to no man who hasn't earned it.

250
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,310
他家庭其馀人也是这样的态度
The rest of his family is the same way.

251
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
不尊重他的人可以抱着洗衣机
Anybody who doesn't respect that can keep his washing machine...

252
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,690
我孩子的衣服可以用其他方法洗
'cause my baby's clothes are gonna be clean anyway.

253
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,570
好吧, 第二项就这些了
Well, I guess that takes care of item number two.

254
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,450
你还好吧?
Are you all right?

255
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,580
我想-- 我想 我的水要断掉了
I think I think my water just broke.

256
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,130
稳住 稳住
We're all calm. We're all calm.

257
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,550
叫车
A car! A car!

258
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,040
- 上校 - 稍息，稍息
- Colonel. - At ease. At ease.

259
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,330
我听说中尉做爸爸了
I heard one of my new lieutenants just became a father.

260
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,340
- 我来祝贺 - 谢谢你,sir
- I came to say congratulations. - Thank you, sir.

261
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,130
我没有打扰你
So, I didn't wanna disturb you.

262
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,300
不，这样好 没关系
No, it's fine. It's all right. Please.

263
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,340
你太太怎么样?
Well, how's your wife?

264
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,970
她很好，正在睡觉
She's okay. She's okay. She's sleeping.

265
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,480
我女儿也是，我只是
So is my daughter. I just...

266
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,100
想在这里待一会儿，见她之前
wanted to be here for a while before I held her.

267
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,360
已经见过她了?
Well, tag her already?

268
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,980
- 那是什么? - Camille。对不起,sir
- What's that say? - Camille. Sorry about this, sir.

269
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,690
别脱下，带着吧，这是命令
Don't take that off. Leave that where it is. That's an order.

270
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,030
- 上校,我可以问你一个问题吗? - 当然
- Colonel, may I ask you a question? - Sure.

271
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,160
你怎么看一个士兵同时也是父亲呢?
What do you think about being a soldier and a father?

272
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,630
我觉得互相补充
I hope that being good at the one...

273
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,670
相得益彰
makes me better at the other.

274
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,670
为什么? 你认为呢?
Why? What about you?

275
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,510
我不知道,sir
I don't know, sir.

276
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,510
在学院和这里
Between college and here...

277
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,970
芭芭拉和我在非洲过了一年
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa.

278
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,110
我们帮助建立了一所孤儿学校
We helped build a school for orphans.

279
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,440
他们成了孤儿是因为另一边的军阀
They were orphans because the warlord across the border...

280
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,440
不喜欢他们的种族
didn't like their tribe.

281
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,330
我知道上帝有一个计划
I know God has a plan for me.

282
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,120
我仅仅希望它可以帮助保护孤儿
I just hope it's to help protect orphans...

283
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,540
而不是制造孤儿
not make any.

284
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,260
好吧，为什么我们不求求他?
Well, why don't we ask him?

285
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,430
来，祈祷吧
Come on. Let's go ask him.

286
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,640
天堂里我们的父亲, 在我们参加战争之前
Our Father in Heaven, before we go into battle...

287
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,940
庇佑我们每个战士
every soldier among us will approach you each in his own way.

288
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,070
也庇佑我们的敌人
Our enemies too...

289
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,730
依照他们自己的理解
according to their own understanding...

290
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,570
请求保护和胜利
will ask for protection and for victory.

291
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,820
因此，我们跪在你无限的智慧面前
And so, we bow before your infinite wisdom.

292
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,280
虔诚地祈祷
We offer our prayers as best we can.

293
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,710
我祈祷你照看年轻人,如同Jack Geoghegan
I pray you watch over the young men, like Jack Geoghegan...

294
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,130
我带他们上战场
that I lead into battle.

295
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,710
你赐我力量在可怕的战争里
You use me as your instrument in this awful hell of war...

296
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,550
看护他们
to watch over them.

297
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,430
尤其是像我身边这样的人
Especially if they're men like this one beside me...

298
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,260
在你的祝福和赞词中拥有未来
deserving of a future in your blessing and good will.

299
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,680
- 阿门 - 阿门
- Amen. - Amen.

300
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,900
对了,还有 主啊
Yes, and one more thing, dear Lord...

301
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,400
关于我们的敌人--
about our enemies

302
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,110
不要理睬他们的异教祈祷
ignore their heathen prayers...

303
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,240
帮忙我们把那些小杂种打下地狱
and help us blow those little bastards straight to hell.

304
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,490
阿门，再一次
Amen again.

305
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,740
阿门
Amen.

306
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,240
谢谢你
Thank you.

307
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,830
你要听关于苹果树 , 会飞的马
There's one about the kid with the apple tree, or the flying horse...

308
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,800
还是有鹿和其他东西的故事呢
or the fairy tales with the deer and stuff in 'em.

309
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,550
爸爸,战争是什么?
Daddy, what is a war?

310
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
战争是
A war is a

311
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,640
它是
Well, it's

312
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,150
它是不该发生却发生了
It's something that shouldn't happen, but it does.

313
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,440
当有些人
It's when...

314
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,740
在另外的国家或任何国家中
some people in another country or any country

315
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,330
想剥夺其他人的生命
try to take the lives of other people.

316
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,080
像你爸爸这样的军人必须
And then soldiers like your daddy have to

317
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,710
去那里阻止他们，这是我的工作
It's my job to go over there and stop them.

318
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,210
他们想要取走你的生命,爸爸?
Are they gonna try to take your life away, Daddy?

319
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,220
是的，他们要试一试
Well, yes, they're gonna try.

320
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,220
我不让
But I'm not gonna let 'em.

321
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,730
好
Okay?

322
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,920
睡不着?
Can't sleep?

323
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,930
他们这么年轻
The men are so young and

324
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,640
有些是新婚夫妇
Now they sent me a new crop even greener.

325
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,680
看着他们
When I look at them, I...

326
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,270
就像我们的孩子
see our boys.

327
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,270
那你正是要带领他们的男人
Well, then you're just the man to lead them.

328
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,780
我试着
I guess.

329
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,170
我们想要说服共产主义者
We intend to convince the Communists...

330
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,300
我们不能够被军队的力量击败
that we cannot be defeated by force of arms.

331
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,010
我问过指挥官Westmoreland将军
I have asked the commanding general, General Westmoreland...

332
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,930
他需要什么来击败那些游击队
what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression.

333
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,060
他告诉我
He has told me...

334
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,230
我们将会满足他的需要
and we will meet his needs.

335
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,530
今天我命令空军到越南
I have today ordered to Vietnam the airmobile division...

336
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,780
还有一些其他部队去加强战斗力
and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength...

337
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,580
从 75,000 到
from 75,000 to...

338
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,370
125,000个人立即出发。
125,000 men almost immediately.

339
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,920
迟一些还有更多的部队投入
Additional forces will be needed later.

340
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,710
找出你们最好的衣服,女士们
Get out your best dresses, ladies.

341
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,720
他们将要庆祝了
They're gonna want to celebrate.

342
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,860
Don't you ever be sad

343
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,030
Lean on me when the times are bad

344
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,240
我没听总统说过紧急状况
I didn't hear the president mention a state of emergency.

345
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,790
他没说过
No, he didn't.

346
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,870
没有告示征募将不会是扩大的
Well, without that declaration our enlistments won't be extended.

347
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,580
对不起,Hal
I'm sorry, Hal.

348
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,670
原谅我,sir,直接告诉我吧
Forgive me, sir, but let me get this straight.

349
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,260
我们用这种从未在战场上试用过的技术
We form a division using techniques never attempted in battle...

350
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,600
来对抗在他土地上有20年作战经验的敌人
against an enemy with 20 years of combat experience on his ground...

351
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,350
离我们国家12,000 里远
12,000 miles away from our ground.

352
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,230
而且把我们送上战场之前
And right before the army sends us into the fight...

353
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,600
他们调走我三分之一富有经验的人,包括指挥官
they take away a third of my most experienced men, including officers.

354
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,770
我也不不愿意这样，Hal
I don't like it any better than you do, Hal.

355
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,490
你看见了,不是吗
You saw this coming, didn't you?

356
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,530
是的。那是你为什么给了我那些新人
Yes. That's why you gave me that new crop of platoon leaders.

357
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,540
朝鲜没有教会他们任何东西
Korea didn't teach 'em anything.

358
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,080
- 政客? - 政客
- Politicians? - Politicians.

359
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,010
Hold me, hold me

360
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,220
Never let me go

361
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,850
Until you've told me told me

362
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,810
What I want to know and then just hold me

363
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,560
Hold me Make me tell you

364
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,780
I'm in love with you

365
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,580
Thrill me, thrill me

366
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,540
谢谢,sir
Thank you, sir.

367
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,750
顺便一提,Hal，我们被调离后
By the way, Hal, since we're being deployed...

368
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,330
他们重编了队伍
they're renumbering the units.

369
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,830
你现在是指挥官
You're now the commanding officer...

370
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
第7骑兵师第1营
of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry.

371
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,050
第7师
The 7th.

372
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,430
如同Custer一般的团
The same regiment as Custer.

373
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,220
谢谢你,sir
Thank you, sir.

374
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,440
Be sensible with your new love

375
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,320
Don't be fooled thinking

376
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,740
This is the last you'll find

377
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,660
But they never stood in the dark

378
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,870
With you, love

379
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,950
When you take me in your arms

380
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,330
And drive me slowly out of my mind

381
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,210
Kiss me, kiss me

382
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,630
And when you do I'll know

383
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,270
看看你们周围
Look around you.

384
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,110
在第7骑兵师
In the 7th Cavalry...

385
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,150
有一位从乌克兰来的上尉
we got a captain from the Ukraine.

386
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,280
另一个来自波多黎各
Another from Puerto Rico.

387
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,660
有日本人,中国人
We've got Japanese, Chinese...

388
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,660
黑人，西语裔 Cherokee印第安人
Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indians.

389
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,960
犹太人和非犹太人
Jews and gentiles.

390
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,500
都是美国人
All Americans.

391
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,630
现在,在这个国家
Now, here in the States...

392
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,840
这个部队中的一些人
some men in this unit...

393
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:26,350
可能经历着种族或是宗教歧视
may experience discrimination because of race or creed.

394
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,350
但是现在对你们和我来说
But for you and me now...

395
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,400
这些都不存在了
all that is gone.

396
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,980
我们将进驻死亡阴影山谷
We're moving into the Valley of the Shadow of Death...

397
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,660
你要看护身边的人
where you will watch the back of the man next to you...

398
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,910
而他也会看护着你
as he will watch yours.

399
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,370
你将不关心他是什么肤色
And you won't care what color he is...

400
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,910
或者他把上帝叫做什么
or by what name he calls God.

401
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,920
我们将要离开家
They say we're leaving home.

402
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,170
我们将要去那个被成为家的地方
We're going to what home was always supposed to be.

403
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,800
因此让我们了解情形
So let us understand the situation.

404
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,850
我们将要上战场
We are going into battle...

405
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,890
与冷酷的敌人作战
against a tough and determined enemy.

406
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,400
我不能答应你们
I can't promise you...

407
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,700
会带着所有人活着回来
that I will bring you all home alive.

408
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,740
但是在这里我发誓
But this I swear

409
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,540
在你们和全能的主面前
before you and before Almighty God

410
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,580
当我们上战场时
that when we go into battle...

411
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,210
我将会第一个踏上战场
I will be the first to set foot on the field...

412
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,210
最后一个离开
and I will be the last to step off.

413

因父之名 the Son and the Holy Ghost,阿门
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen.

769
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,380
Out of the depths I cry unto Thee, O Lord.

770
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,380
主, 听我的祈祷

主, 不要放弃他们
Lord, who can abide them?

774
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,570
用你的怜悯
With Thee there is mercy.

775
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:35,620
守护他们永生, 主啊

愿永生之光照耀他们

01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,630
因主之名, the Son and the Holy Ghost
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

779
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,680
你想死吗，Galloway?
Do you got a death wish, Galloway?

780
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,800
不,sir
No, sir.

781
01:21:57,890 --> 01:21:59,810
那你为什么来这里?
Well, then why are you here?

782
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:06,650
因为我知道这些死者在这里，sir。
'Cause I knew these dead boys would be here, sir.

783
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,660
为什么你不是军人?
Why aren't you a soldier?

784
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,660
你够胆量
You got the guts for it.

785
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,700
我爸爸是个军人
My daddy was a soldier.

786

我爷爷,我的两个曾爷爷都是军人
My granddaddy, two of my great-granddaddies was soldiers.

787
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,880
这就是原因
Hell, that's how I came to be.

788
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:31,420
他们每人在内战中失去了一条腿
Each of them lost a leg in the Civil War.

789
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,090

My Great-granddaddy Galloway, he lost his left...

790
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:37,090
我曾爷爷Reid失去了右腿
and my Great-granddaddy Reid lost his right.

791
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,510
他们在Galveston同一间鞋店中见面
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.

792
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,850
在那之後每年,相同的日期 相同的商店,他们将会聚在一起
Every year after that, same date, same store, they'd get together...

793
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,850
挑出一双适合他们的新鞋
and pick out a new pair of shoes for the two of them.

794
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,860
你开什么玩笑 不,sir

795
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:51,360
我发誓
I swear to God.

796
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:56,490
一个有了女儿 一个有了儿子...我的祖父们
Anyway, one had a daughter, one had a son... my grandparents.

797
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:59,990
奇怪的是他们都有相同的鞋码
What do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was?

798
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,580
我不知道,上校 应该是,我猜
I don't know, Colonel. It was meant to be, I guess.

799
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:07,080
是的
Yeah.

800
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:09,750
可能
Meant to be.

801
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,380
sir, Galloways参加过这个国家的每一次战争
Sir, Galloways have been in every war this country's ever fought.

802
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:19,890
但这一次,我想我不可能结束战争
But when it came to this one, I didn't think I could stop the war.

803
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:23,810
大概是 我也想试着弄清楚点
I just thought maybe I might try and understand one.

804
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:28,020
也许可以把他们带回去 明白
Maybe help folks back home understand.

805
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:33,150
我想可以我用照相机会更好
I just figure I could do that better...

806
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:35,900
比让我来开枪
shooting a camera than I could shooting a rifle.

807
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,740
嗯
Well...

808
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:45,950
我希望你能做到  
I sure hope you make it through this one.

809
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,460
你也是,上校

812
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:19,080
上校,sir
Colonel, sir.

813
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,670
Captain Nadal. Sir.

814
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,090
那是什么,sir?
What is it, sir?

815
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,260
没什么
Nothing's wrong, except there's nothing wrong.

816
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:41,940
你最好回到白蚁土墩，继续
Best get back to the termite mound. You'll be fine. Go on.

817
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,980

818
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:46,240
好的,告诉他们
All right, pass the word on.

819
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,240
每人对可疑之物开三枪

01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:16,100
这次损失惨重
Kind of makes you wish you'd signed up for submarines, don't it?

962
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:20,680
参谋部要你跟凌晨第一架飞机回去
Brigade headquarters wants you out on the first chopper at dawn.

963
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:24,400

What idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle?

964
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:27,440
Westmoreland将军需要听取报告 给我话筒
Gen. Westmoreland wants a briefing. Give me the horn.

965
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:29,980
我正在战斗
I am in a fight...

966
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:32,990
拒绝执行回西贡的命令

967
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:35,240
现在，我不会丢下我的人
Now, I will not leave my men.

968
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,280
明白吗? 完毕

969
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:46,790
两个人不见了
There's two of my men unaccounted for out there...

970
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,800
在战斗最激烈的那边
and it's where the worst of the fighting was...

971
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,670
他们会在哪里
so they'll be out there someplace.

972

我们去找他们 我和你一起去,sir
Let's go out and get 'em. I'm with you, sir.

走
Let's go.

975
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:51,790

They...

976
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:53,540
带来另一个

977
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:55,710
Julie Julie,你的
Oh, God, Julie. Julie, it's yours.

978
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:46,180
他为了我的承诺而死
He died keeping my promise.

979
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:19,170
sir，他们命令我们都出去
Sir, they're ordering us all out.

980
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:21,630
全部
All of us.

981
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:24,050
他们将要火力支援
They're gonna march reinforcements in.

982
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:26,600
他们不清楚这里
They don't understand a damn thing, do they?

983
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:28,930
不能出去
Can't get out.

984
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:34,350
他正在洞里等着我们 想要我们出去
He's waiting up there in a cave, and that's what he wants.

985
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,610
他一见到有人跳下飞机
The minute he sees live soldiers hopping on a helicopter...

986
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:39,530
就会扑上来，那他得逞了
he'll be all over us and then he'll get what he wants.

987
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:41,860
接着就是大屠杀
He'll get his massacre.

988
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:53,120
请求许可再部署
Requesting permission to rejoin the lines, sir.

989
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,590
同意
All right, son.

990
01:51:02,670 --> 01:51:04,720
Garry Owen, sir.

991
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:30,080
Custer在想什么
I wonder what was going through Custer's mind when he realized...

992
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,450
他把他的人带进了屠杀
he'd led his men into a slaughter.

993
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,870
sir, Custer是只猫
Sir, Custer was a pussy.

994
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,630
你不是
You ain't.

995
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:45,130
见鬼
Goddamn.

996
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:51,680
去死
Hell.

997
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:57,350
他们正在准备最后的进攻
Right now they're planning their final attack...

998
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,520
这会让我们没命
the one that will finish us off.

999
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,860
他们会在晚上一点点地吞噬我们
They'll nibble at us all night, then...

1000
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:05,950
凌晨他们将竭尽全力冲上来
come dawn they'll hit us with everything they got.

1001
01:52:07,490 --> 01:52:10,070
如果我是他，我就这么做
That's what I'd do if I was him.

1002
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:18,750
长官,发下最后的弹药

1003
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:20,750

1004

上刺刀
Fix bayonets.

1005
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:03,340
你在想Custer感觉如何,先生
You were wondering how Custer felt, sir.

1006
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:06,560
你应该去问他
You ought to ask him.

1007
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:26,900
Sergeant Savage!

1008
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,870
检查敌人的文件
Checking the dead enemies for documents...

1009
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:40,500
我在那个想刺死你的家伙身上发现这东西

1010
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:43,170
翻译一些

1011
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:45,840
希望你愿意看一眼
Thought you might wanna have a look at it.

1012
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:20,630
那是什么? 美国的火炮

1013
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:25,170
自己人

1014
02:01:25,250 --> 02:01:27,170
多少伤亡?

1015
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:32,050
这里怎么了,乔?

1016
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,310
嗨，乔

1017
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:42,110
摩尔上校

1018
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,780
上校

你胜利的关键是什么? 先生, 告诉我们你感觉如何
What is the key to your victory? Sir, tell us how you feel.

1020
02:01:52,450 --> 02:01:54,620
你感觉美国将会被迫
Do you feel the States will be forced...

1021
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:56,660
更加残酷地对待北越人吗？

1022
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:59,660
你对那些死去的手下怎么看,sir?

sir, 我不

1031
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,630
我不知道该如何讲这个故事

1032
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:18,260
该你了,乔

你告诉美国人这些人在这里所做的

1036
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:44,370
谢谢

1037
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:35,460
我们所有人，活着的或是死去的 都离开战场了，sir
All of our men, living and dead, are off the field, sir.

1038
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:37,470
很好

1039
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:37,960
在西贡,Hal Moore的长官祝贺他

for killing over 1,800 enemy soldiers.

1041
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:44,680
然后命令他带领第7骑兵师

1042
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:47,140
回到死亡山谷中
back into the Valley of Death.

1043
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:49,100
他带领他们
He led them...

1044
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,310
和他们共同奋战
and fought beside them...

1045
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:53,980
又坚持了235天

1046
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:18,750
孩子们,睡觉去了 谁在敲门？

1047
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:21,000
睡觉去

1048
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:04,590
孩子,爸爸回家了 爸爸!

家人在等着我们回去

1050
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:17,310
还有很多人受伤了
For others, their only family would be the men they bled beside.

1051
02:09:17,390 --> 02:09:21,310
没有乐团, 没有彩旗
There were no bands, no flags...

1052
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,980
没有荣誉欢迎他们回家
no honor guards to welcome them home.

1053
02:09:25,230 --> 02:09:28,740
国家命令他们去作战
They went to war because their country ordered them to.

1054
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:31,820
但最后他们不是为国家或旗帜而战
But in the end they fought not for their country or their flag.

1055
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:35,580
他们为了彼此而战
They fought for each other...

1056
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:41,130
亲爱的芭芭拉...

02:09:41,210 --> 02:09:46,210
杰克死了我也很伤心
I have no words to express to you my sadness of the loss of Jack.

1058
02:09:47,550 --> 02:09:50,050
没有他世界变得无趣
The world is a lesser place without him.

1059
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:53,810
但我知道他正陪伴着上帝和天使
But I know he is with God and the angels.

1060
02:09:53,890 --> 02:09:57,730
因为他的存在天堂也随之美好
And even heaven is improved by his presence there.

1061
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:01,310
你也是这么想的吧
I know you, too, are sure of this...

1062
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:04,980
尽管知道这些不能弥补他的离去
and yet this knowledge can't diminish his loss...

1063
02:10:05,070 --> 02:10:06,940
减少你的悲伤
and your grief.

1064
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:11,280
Hal Moore敬上

1065
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:26,590
我们曾看到过战争
We who have seen war...

1066
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:28,920
从不忘怀
will never stop seeing it.

1067
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:35,390
在静静的夜晚 我们总会听到尖叫声
In the silence of the night, we will always hear the screams.

1068
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,810
这就是我们的故事
So this is our story...

1069
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:46,020
因为我们曾是战士
for we were soldiers once...

1070
02:10:46,110 --> 02:10:48,030
而且年轻
and young.
