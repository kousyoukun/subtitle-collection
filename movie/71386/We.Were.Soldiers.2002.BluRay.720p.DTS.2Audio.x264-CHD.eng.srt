1
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,720
These are the true events of November, 1965

2
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,340
The la Drang Valley of Vietnam

3
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,010
a place our country does not remember...

4
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:48,520
in a war it does not understand.

5
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,060
This story's a testament to the young Americans...

6
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,060
who died in the Valley of Death...

7
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,570
and a tribute to the young men of the Peoples Army of Vietnam...

8
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,570
who died by our hand in that place.

9
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,820
To tell this story, I must start at the beginning.

10
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,540
But where does it begin?

11
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,500
Maybe in June of 1954, when French Group Mobile 100...

12
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:17,420
moved into the same Central Highlands of Vietnam...

13
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,920
where we would go 11 years later.

14
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:20,600
Maybe the story begins in America...

15
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:24,560
when the army first realized a new kind of war was coming its way.

16
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,190
The White House anticipates a buildup and wants a victory...

17
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:29,190
over cavemen in black pajamas.

18
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,820
We wouldn't be there if they hadn't already beaten the French Army.

19
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:34,830
The French Army? What's that?

20
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,120
The problem in Vietnam is terrain jungles, mountains, rivers.

21
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,620
Maneuver's a nightmare.

22
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,040
We have a plan to use helicopters leap in and out of battle.

23
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,090
They want you to run the test on the idea.

24
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,920
It'll take a hell of a combat leader.

25
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:50,470
I know a young light colonel named Hal Moore.

26
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:52,470
He led a combat company in Korea.

27
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:55,220
After that, he volunteered to test experimental parachutes.

28
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,930
Experimental parachutes? Sounds like just the guy.

29
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:03,440
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see

30
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,480
Was all that he could see Was all that he could see

31
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:12,650
The other side of the mountain was all that he could see

32
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:16,450
The bear went over the mountain The bear went over the mountain

33
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,950
The bear went over the mountain

34
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,620
How about we go back to "Bingo"? What do you say? "Bingo".

35
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,880
B-I-N-G-O

36
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,590
B-I-N-G-O

37
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,670
B-I-N-G-O

38
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,130
And Bingo was his name-o

39
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:52,110
Tom, how much you know about our new colonel?

40
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,780
He was in Korea...

41
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,200
has a master's in international relations from Harvard.

42
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,740
Harvard? He's not one of those academic pussies, is he?

43
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,240
Hal Moore?

44
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,460
Want me to get one of those?

45
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:57,550
Come on, Too Tall. Gimme your best shot!

46
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,100
Did you see that, sports fans? Did you see that?

47
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,680
Snakeshit drives that one to the moon, baby!

48
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,270
Hit the cutoff man! Hit the cutoff man!

49
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:09,520
And he's coming around!

50
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:12,730
- Here he comes! - No, he's not.

51
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,200
You're out! You're out!

52
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:22,530
Horseshit! No wonder you can't fly. You can't see.

53
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,910
I believe you're out.

54
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,880
- You're a pilot? - Too Tall, sir.

55
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,840
- Yeah, I can see that. - You call, we haul.

56
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,560
- Can I speak to you, Crandall? - Yes, sir.

57
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,730
- Out. - Safe.

58
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:48,850
- Out. - Safe.

59
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,690
- Can I buy you a drink? - Sure.

60
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:54,190
Thanks.

61
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,490
So, your men call you "Snakeshit".

62
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:01,240
That's an affectionate appellation of my comrades-in-arms, sir...

63
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,370
'cause I fly lower than snake shit.

64
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:07,410
Well, I got a problem, Snakeshit, and I think you're the solution.

65
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,040
I've been called a lot of things, Colonel, never a solution.

66
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,670
You know what air cavalry really means?

67
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:17,050
You fly into hostile territory, outnumbered 10,000 miles from home.

68
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,300
Sometimes the battleground's no bigger than a football field.

69
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:23,720
And if the choppers stop comin', we all get slaughtered.

70
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,720
Now, I figure chopper pilots won't fly into hell for strangers...

71
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:29,310
so... I'm Hal Moore.

72
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:31,480
I know, sir. Why us?

73
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,780
Well, you guys look like shit, but your equipment is immaculate.

74
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:40,820
Yesterday was Sunday. You didn't have to be training, but you were.

75
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,740
You got pilots like that Too Tall character.

76
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,830
He's way outside the limits of army regs.

77
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,330
They wanna fly with you for some reason.

78
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,330
I guess it's 'cause they think you're the best.

79
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,960
It's 'cause I only recruit the dumb ones, sir.

80
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,090
I don't suppose I have a choice in all this.

81
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:01,840
You sure don't.

82
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,590
Wouldn't miss it for the world.

83
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,140
To the Air Cav.

84
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,520
Good mornin', Sergeant Major.

85
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:19,570
How do you know what kind of goddamn day it is?

86
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,750
Group! Atten-hut!

87
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,190
At ease, gentlemen.

88
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,030
Welcome to the new cavalry.

89
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,490
We will ride into battle.

90
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,780
And this... will be our horse.

91
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,100
You don't have to catch it. You don't have to feed it.

92
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,230
But I can assure you...

93
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:45,610
that neither the new technology nor your status as officers...

94
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,030
will keep you above the danger.

95
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,250
Sergeant-Major Plumley and I come from the paratroopers...

96
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:56,920
where the officer is always the first one out of the plane.

97
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,920
Because to follow your instincts...

98
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
and to inspire your men by your example...

99
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,930
you have to be with them where the metal meets the meat.

100
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,560
Sergeant-Major Plumley made all four combat jumps...

101
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,180
in the 82nd Airborne during World War II.

102
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,350
Sicily, Salerno, Normandy...

103
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,480
and Holland, plus one more in Korea.

104
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,490
He answers to me and to me alone.

105
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,490
Now, I hope you gentlemen like training...

106
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,910
'cause me and the sergeant-major

107
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,080
we love it.

108
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,710
Three strikes and you're not out!

109
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,710
There is always one more thing you can do.

110
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,310
Here we go, boys.

111
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,640
Move! Move! Go! Now!

112
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,850
- Two. - Let's go!

113
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,860
Three.

114
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,320
We're outta here!

115
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,440
- Pretty good, huh? - Pretty good.

116
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,660
There's only one thing wrong.

117
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,040
Be sharp! We will be the best platoon in this battalion!

118
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,540
Be ready in there! Let's go! Let's go!

119
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:20,250
All right! Your officer's dead!

120
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,290
- What do you do? What do you do? - First

121
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,300
All right, he hesitated. He's dead. What do you do?

122
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:27,510
- Get off the chopper! - Get off the chopper.

123
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:38,020
Hold off the third one.

124
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,640
Come on in.

125
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:44,230
Savage, you learn the job of the man above you...

126
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:46,650
and you teach your job to the man below you in rank.

127
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,650
That goes for every man in this outfit.

128
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,320
- Understood? - Yes, sir!

129
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,030
We'll be landing under fire, gentlemen.

130
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:57,740
Men will die.

131
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,750
Have you said your prayers?

132
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:10,670
Come on. I'll say them with you.

133
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,840
- Fall in. - Gimme that bear.

134
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,470
All right. Ready. Set.

135
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:22,940
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

136
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:26,190
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

137
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,150
Blessed art thou amongst women...

138
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,860
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.

139
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,650
Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners

140
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,700
Cecile, I don't hear you praying, honey.

141
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,870
I don't wanna be Catholic. I wanna be a "Nethodist" like Mommy.

142
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,830
You do?

143
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,040
And why is that, honey?

144
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,170
So I can pray whatever I want.

145
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,380
That's a sin.

146
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,380
No, that's not a sin.

147
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:53,630
God just made you hardheaded. It's not a sin.

148
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,260
I'll tell you what. You wanna

149
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,810
You wanna pray and thank God for our family?

150
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,190
- Yes, sir. - That's good. Let's do it.

151
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,810
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.

152
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,980
Blessed art thou among women...

153
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:12,240
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

154
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,290
I can hear you laughing, you know, even in here.

155
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,160
I'm not laughing, I'm marveling.

156
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,500
Marveling? At what?

157
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,920
That you can find stubbornness in your children...

158
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,550
and think it comes from anybody but you.

159
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:32,050
- Yeah? - Mm-hmm.

160
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,890
I'll give you something to marvel at.

161
00:14:41,310 --> 00:14:42,720
He's a wild man.

162
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,660
- When I pray - Mm-hmm.

163
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,160
whatever I want

164
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,380
I thank God for you.

165
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,560
Beautiful morning, Sergeant Major.

166
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,100
What are you, a fuckin' weatherman now?

167
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:33,480
Look what I found for the new baseball player.

168
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,940
- Sent us another bunch of officers. - Uh-huh.

169
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:38,490
Real green. Gotta train 'em up.

170
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,870
Makes me think I'm starting a new unit.

171
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,030
They sent new rifles too. The M-16.

172
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,080
That's supposed to be a pretty good weapon.

173
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,080
Lots of plastic.

174
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:51,630
Feels like a BB gun to me. Believe I'll stick with my pistol.

175
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,710
You think we're gonna get close enough to the enemy to use that?

176
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,340
What do you think, sir?

177
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,510
A leader must remain cool and calm.

178
00:15:59,590 --> 00:16:03,470
And second, he must learn to ignore explosions...

179
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,350
the heat and dust, the screams of the wounded.

180
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:11,020
This is normal on a battlefield. Normal!

181
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,870
Fortran, you need to get a company over to reinforce the left flank.

182
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:31,540
- Where is that coming from? - That's our advisors in Vietnam.

183
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,540
The new radio's picking up atmospheric bounce.

184
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,110
When Crazy Horse was a baby...

185
00:16:59,190 --> 00:17:02,740
he nursed from the breast of every woman in the tribe.

186
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,290
The Sioux raised their children that way.

187
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,790
Every warrior...

188
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:12,830
called every woman in the tribe "mother".

189
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,340
Every older warrior, they called him "grandfather".

190
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,630
Now, the point here is that they fought as a family.

191
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,220
Take care of your men.

192
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,260
Teach them to take care of each other.

193
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:29,270
'Cause when this starts...

194
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,230
each other is all we're gonna have.

195
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,320
- Did you tune that in? - Yes, sir.

196
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,660
Well, that's fine. You're my radio operator.

197
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,740
You'll be fine. You'll work it out.

198
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,550
Any of you sons of bitches calls me Grandpa...

199
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,050
I'll kill ya.

200
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:28,910
Godboldt, take your boots off.

201
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:30,740
Go on.

202
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:36,500
Everybody, take your boots off. Everybody.

203
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,750
Socks too.

204
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,060
I want you to draw fresh socks from supply.

205
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,770
Keep your feet dusted with powder.

206
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,940
Everybody check each other's feet like Godboldt and me.

207
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,700
Now, that young man's a leader.

208
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,370
Yes, sir.

209
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:12,660
That other fella that big, strong one there

210
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:14,660
he wants to win medals.

211
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,840
Why were you in the back?

212
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:22,050
Goddamn it, why were you in the back?

213
00:19:23,130 --> 00:19:25,050
He's eager.

214
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:30,970
Ladies, I'm really, really glad you're here today.

215
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,270
Some of you are new to the army and all of us are new to this post.

216
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,810
I thought we'd pool our resources and cover questions we have.

217
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,110
So, why don't we start with item number one food.

218
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,610
Where's the best place to shop?

219
00:19:48,990 --> 00:19:50,910
Well, I tried Big Star, and it's okay.

220
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:54,120
But I keep thinking my water's gonna break right in the checkout aisle.

221
00:19:57,370 --> 00:20:01,170
That takes care of food shopping. So, item number two laundry.

222
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,710
The base washing machines don't work.

223
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:05,050
They're full of sand from the swamp missions.

224
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,800
I'll take care of that.

225
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,890
- I've already complained. - We'll just go to the general.

226
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,310
In the meantime, the Laundromat in town's okay...

227
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:16,850
but they won't let you wash your colored things in their machines.

228
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:19,810
- At a public Laundromat? - Didn't make sense to me either.

229
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,810
I'm telling you, they have a sign right in the window...

230
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,190
says "Whites Only".

231
00:20:26,570 --> 00:20:30,110
- What? - They mean white people only.

232
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,410
That's awful.

233
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:37,410
Your husband is wearing the uniform of a country that allows a place...

234
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:43,040
to say his laundry's not good enough, when he could die for

235
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,340
- I'm sorry. I just - That's all right, honey.

236
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,260
I know what my husband's fighting for, and that's why I can smile.

237
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,850
My husband will never ask for respect...

238
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:00,060
and he'll give respect to no man who hasn't earned it.

239
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,310
The rest of his family is the same way.

240
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,520
Anybody who doesn't respect that can keep his washing machine...

241
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,690
'cause my baby's clothes are gonna be clean anyway.

242
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,570
Well, I guess that takes care of item number two.

243
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,450
Are you all right?

244
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:22,580
I think I think my water just broke.

245
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:25,130
We're all calm. We're all calm.

246
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,550
A car! A car!

247
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,040
- Colonel. - At ease. At ease.

248
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,330
I heard one of my new lieutenants just became a father.

249
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,340
- I came to say congratulations. - Thank you, sir.

250
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,130
So, I didn't wanna disturb you.

251
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:14,300
No, it's fine. It's all right. Please.

252
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,340
Well, how's your wife?

253
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:18,970
She's okay. She's okay. She's sleeping.

254
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:22,480
So is my daughter. I just...

255
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,100
wanted to be here for a while before I held her.

256
00:22:25,190 --> 00:22:27,360
Well, tag her already?

257
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,980
- What's that say? - Camille. Sorry about this, sir.

258
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:32,690
Don't take that off. Leave that where it is. That's an order.

259
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,030
- Colonel, may I ask you a question? - Sure.

260
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:44,160
What do you think about being a soldier and a father?

261
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,630
I hope that being good at the one...

262
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:49,670
makes me better at the other.

263
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,670
Why? What about you?

264
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,510
I don't know, sir.

265
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,510
Between college and here...

266
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:02,970
Barbara and I spent a year in Africa.

267
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:08,110
We helped build a school for orphans.

268
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,440
They were orphans because the warlord across the border...

269
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:14,440
didn't like their tribe.

270
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:21,330
I know God has a plan for me.

271
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,120
I just hope it's to help protect orphans...

272
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,540
not make any.

273
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,260
Well, why don't we ask him?

274
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:36,430
Come on. Let's go ask him.

275
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,640
Our Father in Heaven, before we go into battle...

276
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,940
every soldier among us will approach you each in his own way.

277
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:52,070
Our enemies too...

278
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,730
according to their own understanding...

279
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,570
will ask for protection and for victory.

280
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:59,820
And so, we bow before your infinite wisdom.

281
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,280
We offer our prayers as best we can.

282
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:06,710
I pray you watch over the young men, like Jack Geoghegan...

283
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,130
that I lead into battle.

284
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:12,710
You use me as your instrument in this awful hell of war...

285
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,550
to watch over them.

286
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,430
Especially if they're men like this one beside me...

287
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,260
deserving of a future in your blessing and good will.

288
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,680
- Amen. - Amen.

289
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,900
Yes, and one more thing, dear Lord...

290
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,400
about our enemies

291
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:36,110
ignore their heathen prayers...

292
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:38,240
and help us blow those little bastards straight to hell.

293
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,490
Amen again.

294
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,740
Amen.

295
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,240
Thank you.

296
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,830
There's one about the kid with the apple tree, or the flying horse...

297
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,800
or the fairy tales with the deer and stuff in 'em.

298
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,550
Daddy, what is a war?

299
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
A war is a

300
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,640
Well, it's

301
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:15,150
It's something that shouldn't happen, but it does.

302
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,440
It's when...

303
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:23,740
some people in another country or any country

304
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,330
try to take the lives of other people.

305
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:31,080
And then soldiers like your daddy have to

306
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,710
It's my job to go over there and stop them.

307
00:25:35,090 --> 00:25:39,210
Are they gonna try to take your life away, Daddy?

308
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:46,220
Well, yes, they're gonna try.

309
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:48,220
But I'm not gonna let 'em.

310
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:50,730
Okay?

311
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,920
Can't sleep?

312
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,930
The men are so young and

313
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:07,640
Now they sent me a new crop even greener.

314
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,680
When I look at them, I...

315
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,270
see our boys.

316
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,270
Well, then you're just the man to lead them.

317
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,780
I guess.

318
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,170
We intend to convince the Communists...

319
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:44,300
that we cannot be defeated by force of arms.

320
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,010
I have asked the commanding general, General Westmoreland...

321
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:54,930
what more he needs to meet this mounting aggression.

322
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,060
He has told me...

323
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,230
and we will meet his needs.

324
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:07,530
I have today ordered to Vietnam the airmobile division...

325
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,780
and certain other forces which will raise our fighting strength...

326
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,580
from 75,000 to...

327
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:17,370
125,000 men almost immediately.

328
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,920
Additional forces will be needed later.

329
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:24,710
Get out your best dresses, ladies.

330
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,720
They're gonna want to celebrate.

331
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,860
Don't you ever be sad

332
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,030
Lean on me when the times are bad

333
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,240
I didn't hear the president mention a state of emergency.

334
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,790
No, he didn't.

335
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:59,870
Well, without that declaration our enlistments won't be extended.

336
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,580
I'm sorry, Hal.

337
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:05,670
Forgive me, sir, but let me get this straight.

338
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:09,260
We form a division using techniques never attempted in battle...

339
00:29:09,340 --> 00:29:13,600
against an enemy with 20 years of combat experience on his ground...

340
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:16,350
12,000 miles away from our ground.

341
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,230
And right before the army sends us into the fight...

342
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:22,600
they take away a third of my most experienced men, including officers.

343
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:25,770
I don't like it any better than you do, Hal.

344
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,490
You saw this coming, didn't you?

345
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,530
Yes. That's why you gave me that new crop of platoon leaders.

346
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,540
Korea didn't teach 'em anything.

347
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:41,080
- Politicians? - Politicians.

348
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,010
Hold me, hold me

349
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,220
Never let me go

350
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:56,850
Until you've told me told me

351
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:01,810
What I want to know and then just hold me

352
00:30:01,850 --> 00:30:04,560
Hold me Make me tell you

353
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:08,780
I'm in love with you

354
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:16,580
Thrill me, thrill me

355
00:30:17,950 --> 00:30:19,540
Thank you, sir.

356
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,750
By the way, Hal, since we're being deployed...

357
00:30:21,830 --> 00:30:23,330
they're renumbering the units.

358
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:24,830
You're now the commanding officer...

359
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
of the 1st Battalion of the 7th Cavalry.

360
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:32,050
The 7th.

361
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,430
The same regiment as Custer.

362
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,220
Thank you, sir.

363
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:44,440
Be sensible with your new love

364
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,320
Don't be fooled thinking

365
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,740
This is the last you'll find

366
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:55,660
But they never stood in the dark

367
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,870
With you, love

368
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,950
When you take me in your arms

369
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,330
And drive me slowly out of my mind

370
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:09,210
Kiss me, kiss me

371
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:11,630
And when you do I'll know

372
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,270
Look around you.

373
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:56,110
In the 7th Cavalry...

374
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:59,150
we got a captain from the Ukraine.

375
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,280
Another from Puerto Rico.

376
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:05,660
We've got Japanese, Chinese...

377
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,660
Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indians.

378
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,960
Jews and gentiles.

379
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,500
All Americans.

380
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:18,630
Now, here in the States...

381
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:21,840
some men in this unit...

382
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:26,350
may experience discrimination because of race or creed.

383
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,350
But for you and me now...

384
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,400
all that is gone.

385
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,980
We're moving into the Valley of the Shadow of Death...

386
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:41,660
where you will watch the back of the man next to you...

387
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,910
as he will watch yours.

388
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,370
And you won't care what color he is...

389
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:49,910
or by what name he calls God.

390
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,920
They say we're leaving home.

391
00:33:55,630 --> 00:33:59,170
We're going to what home was always supposed to be.

392
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:04,800
So let us understand the situation.

393
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:07,850
We are going into battle...

394
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:10,890
against a tough and determined enemy.

395
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,400
I can't promise you...

396
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,700
that I will bring you all home alive.

397
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,740
But this I swear

398
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:29,540
before you and before Almighty God

399
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:31,580
that when we go into battle...

400
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,210
I will be the first to set foot on the field...

401
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:40,210
and I will be the last to step off.

402
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:46,050
And I will leave no one behind.

403
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,520
Dead or alive...

404
00:34:54,390 --> 00:34:56,860
we will all come home together.

405
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,690
So help me God.

406
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:29,990
I love you.

407
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:31,920
Hal, last night the enemy hit our camp at Plaei Me.

408
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,500
- How many casualties? - None.

409
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,710
The enemy forces withdrew toward this mountain...

410
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,420
near the Cambodian border.

411
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:40,720
How many men do you have battle-ready?

412
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,600
- Sergeant Major? - Three hundred ninety-five, sir.

413
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,850
Exactly.

414
00:41:45,930 --> 00:41:47,390
What do you estimate the enemy strength?

415
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:49,770
We appraise their numbers as manageable, Colonel.

416
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,850
You have no idea.

417
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:56,440
We have no idea. Simple orders, Hal.

418
00:41:56,530 --> 00:41:58,900
Find the enemy and kill him.

419
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:06,030
They attack us, no casualties. They run and hide in the mountains.

420
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,620
Naturally we chase them, of course.

421
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,540
Smell like an ambush to you?

422
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:16,550
They get close enough to kill us, we'll be close enough to kill them.

423
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:22,970
Round trip by chopper, 30 minutes.

424
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:27,720
So the first 60 men on the ground will be there half an hour alone.

425
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:29,220
Son of a bitch.

426
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:34,020
I think maybe you ought to get yourself that M-16.

427
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:38,020
Time comes I need one, there'll be plenty of 'em lying on the ground.

428
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,370
Well, let's go do what we came here to do.

429
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,870
Yes, sir.

430
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,550
Garry Owen!

431
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,660
It was a Sunday.

432
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,540
November 14, 1965.

433
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,840
Before that day, the soldiers of North Vietnam...

434
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,380
and those of America...

435
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:27,300
never met each other in a major battle.

436
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:58,620
Two miles out. Dropping to nap of the earth.

437
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:04,230
First Platoon, let's move!

438
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:18,490
This is Trojan Two. All units maintain perimeter contact. Over.

439
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,620
It's a scout! Let's take him prisoner!

440
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:27,080
Hey! Lieutenant!

441
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:34,550
There he goes! Come on!

442
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:40,760
Come on!

443
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,680
Captain, I want you to keep in contact with all patrols.

444
00:48:46,140 --> 00:48:48,770
Hey, I got something here. I got a boy! Here.

445
00:48:48,810 --> 00:48:50,110
Boy, hell.

446
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:51,610
That ain't no boy.

447
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,410
- He say he a deserter. - Bullshit, he's a lookout.

448
00:48:59,490 --> 00:49:01,410
Ask him where his friends are.

449
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,000
He say this is base camp of whole division.

450
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:12,710
- Four thousand men. - Where?

451
00:49:18,510 --> 00:49:20,300
That mountain.

452
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,980
Same army destroyed French.

453
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,980
And he say they want kill American very badly.

454
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:36,110
Just not been able to find any yet.

455
00:49:36,190 --> 00:49:39,570
Captain Metsker, tell all patrols to hold their positions.

456
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:50,290
You, take the radio!

457
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:55,300
- Where are they? - Sir, we gotta get that guy!

458
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,430
Call in all the patrols!

459
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:06,770
We have to engage the enemy as far away from the LZ as possible!

460
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,560
Net Call, Net Call, this is Trojan-Two.

461
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,690
Grab the wounded! Break contact!

462
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:18,360
Fall back! Get to high ground!

463
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,200
Cover fire! Get to high ground!

464
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:22,660
Come on!

465
00:50:32,870 --> 00:50:35,880
Come on! Get up here! Bring the wounded up to the middle!

466
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:37,710
Move it, move it!

467
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,090
Cover fire! Cover fire!

468
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,890
Everybody down! Down!

469
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,980
Check your ammo! Everybody check ammo!

470
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:01,280
Come on! I'll get us out of here!

471
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,870
Grab the wounded! We'll make a run

472
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,030
- Sarge! - We gotta get out of here!

473
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,910
Stay down! Don't anybody move!

474
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:13,710
Bungum, stay down!

475
00:51:25,930 --> 00:51:27,430
You're gonna be okay.

476
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,100
Stay down.

477
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,690
Form a perimeter!

478
00:51:34,770 --> 00:51:38,070
Conserve your ammo and stay down!

479
00:51:40,190 --> 00:51:42,650
What's happening with those patrols?

480
00:51:42,690 --> 00:51:46,620
I'm trying to reach them, sir! This is Trojan-Two! Come in! Over!

481
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,290
Hey! Hey! Calm down!

482
00:51:50,370 --> 00:51:53,710
Understand the situation and communicate clearly!

483
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:01,590
Pull the chain on all the firepower you can get on that mountain!

484
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,300
Alert Crandall! We have a hot LZ!!

485
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:06,930
Agent Serpent-Six, this is Trojan-Two.

486
00:52:07,010 --> 00:52:09,850
You're coming into a hot LZ. We are taking fire.

487
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,850
Repeat. We are taking fire.

488
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:14,390
No shit.

489
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:18,110
This is Too Tall goin' down and dirty.

490
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:25,650
Roger that! Trojan-Two, out!

491
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:28,320
Herrick's platoon is cut off and under attack.

492
00:52:28,410 --> 00:52:29,830
Bravo Company's holding.

493
00:52:30,910 --> 00:52:32,830
They're gonna try and flank us.

494
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,340
On the ground now! Move!

495
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,340
- Watch him! - We gotta go.

496
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:48,800
We're outta here.

497
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,600
They're coming at us from the back now! Move!

498
00:52:57,640 --> 00:52:59,060
Savage.

499
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:04,440
All right, all right, I got you.

500
00:53:05,740 --> 00:53:06,860
Sir?

501
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:10,870
Don't let them get the signal codes.

502
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:13,740
Roger that, sir.

503
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,210
I'm glad I could die for my country.

504
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,890
Doc.

505
00:53:51,910 --> 00:53:53,830
Bungum.

506
00:53:54,910 --> 00:53:56,330
Sarge?

507
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,500
Tell my wife...

508
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:06,300
I love her.

509
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,340
This is Savage.

510
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:15,060
I need artillery to these coordinates: niner-3-3-0-1

511
00:54:17,970 --> 00:54:20,890
Ernie! Ernie, help! We got more coming!

512
00:54:20,940 --> 00:54:23,560
We are cut off. Copy? We are cut off.

513
00:54:26,110 --> 00:54:28,320
- Fire! - Fire!

514
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,990
- Fire! - Fire!

515
00:54:31,990 --> 00:54:33,530
They're getting closer!

516
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,990
They're getting closer! A hundred more, sir!

517
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,050
They're right on top of us, sir! Bring it in close!

518
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:56,660
It's a hot LZ! We'll be jumping! We will not touch down.

519
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,010
They're trying to break right through us!

520
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:16,180
I want you to reinforce Alpha Company there! Now! Move!

521
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,390
Follow me! Charlie Company, up on the ridge!

522
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:22,430
Doc, the wounded are over by that termite mound! Go!

523
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,230
Sir, if you don't find some cover, you're gonna go down!

524
00:56:25,310 --> 00:56:27,850
If you go down, we all go down! Come on!

525
00:56:43,620 --> 00:56:44,790
Cobain!

526
00:56:44,870 --> 00:56:47,960
I want the M-60 right here!

527
00:56:54,760 --> 00:56:56,220
Radio!

528
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:01,470
Sir, it's Captain Edwards on the ridge, sir!

529
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:05,180
- Bob! - Colonel, these guys are regulars!

530
00:57:05,270 --> 00:57:09,230
Heavily armed! AK-47s and pouches of grenades!

531
00:57:09,270 --> 00:57:11,770
Heavy machine guns and shoulder-fired rockets!

532
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:31,840
Captain Nadal!

533
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,800
That creek bed is vital. Vital!

534
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:37,800
They'll be coming right at you! Do not let them flank!

535
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,090
I repeat, do not let them flank!

536
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:42,600
Secure the creek bed!

537
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:02,490
Tom, I want you to keep trying to raise those Medevac boys.

538
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,460
I'm all right.

539
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:19,470
Charlie, come here.

540
00:58:19,510 --> 00:58:23,100
Get me all the air support you can get me on that mountain! Now!

541
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:25,260
Requesting immediate close air support!

542
00:58:25,350 --> 00:58:27,220
I need you to burn 'em out...

543
00:58:27,310 --> 00:58:31,690
on hilltop Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo!

544
00:58:31,770 --> 00:58:35,980
Coordinates: Golf-4-5-0-9!

545
00:58:51,000 --> 00:58:54,330
- Get me something higher up! - Shifting to hilltop Bravo!

546
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:57,800
Golf-4-5-7-2!

547
00:58:59,130 --> 00:59:02,840
I say again, 4-5-7-2!

548
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:17,690
Medevac Command of the 7th Cavalry, are you inbound?

549
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,690
Looks pretty hot down there.

550
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,240
Yeah. You can make it, though. Watch our approach, follow us in.

551
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:26,740
Copy that, 7th Cav. We will follow your approach.

552
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:47,970
I want you to get over there and reinforce Charlie Company there!

553
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,060
Medevac, abort! Abort! This is a hot LZ!

554
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:57,230
You see that? My Medevac guys are buggin' out and leaving the wounded!

555
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:01,900
We're going down!

556
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,960
- Snake, get out of here! - Bring me the wounded!

557
01:00:15,040 --> 01:00:16,580
Wounded! Get the wounded!

558
01:00:16,670 --> 01:00:18,460
Come on! Come on!

559
01:00:23,720 --> 01:00:25,430
Okay, here!

560
01:00:25,510 --> 01:00:28,470
They're still trying to flank us! Stretch out along the line!

561
01:00:32,970 --> 01:00:34,430
Radio!

562
01:00:37,810 --> 01:00:41,610
Trojan-Six! We are in heavy contact! In danger of being overrun!

563
01:00:41,690 --> 01:00:45,030
If they get into that LZ, we've all had it. Can you hold?

564
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:47,610
We're spread thin, sir, but we'll give 'em hell!

565
01:00:55,290 --> 01:00:58,210
Crandall, this is Trojan-Six. It's too hot down here.

566
01:00:58,290 --> 01:01:01,210
- I'm closing the LZ. - You copy that, Too Tall?

567
01:01:01,290 --> 01:01:03,300
Copy that, Snake.

568
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:06,340
All 7th Cav air units: LZ X-Ray is closed.

569
01:01:06,430 --> 01:01:09,590
I don't like it. First time out, a whole battalion massacred?

570
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,810
You think this is a massacre?

571
01:01:11,890 --> 01:01:15,180
Losing draftees is a bad week. Losing a colonel is a massacre.

572
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:16,690
Moore is still fighting.

573
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:18,810
He's under strength against more men than he can count.

574
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:21,570
- He's got a whole platoon lost. - They're not lost.

575
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:23,780
They're only cut off and surrounded.

576
01:01:27,070 --> 01:01:28,660
Then they're lost.

577
01:01:28,740 --> 01:01:31,160
- Sergeant Major! - Sir!

578
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:36,620
We need to carve out an emergency LZ right over there.

579
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:38,670
- Sir! - Blow the trees down!

580
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:50,180
Fire in the hole!

581
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:58,140
Colonel, this is Snakeshit and Too Tall.

582
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:00,100
We're comin' in with two loads of ammo.

583
01:02:00,190 --> 01:02:02,150
Crandall, we've blown a new LZ.

584
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:04,730
When you come in, come in from the east. Out.

585
01:02:09,070 --> 01:02:11,160
Colonel, it's Brigade Headquarters. They want you out.

586
01:02:11,240 --> 01:02:14,740
- Well, we can't get out, damn it! - Not all of us. Just you.

587
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:17,750
Saigon wants to debrief you.

588
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,250
- That doesn't make any sense. - Say again.

589
01:02:20,290 --> 01:02:22,710
Will you repeat that order?

590
01:02:28,630 --> 01:02:30,840
Too Tall, follow the colonel to the new LZ.

591
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:32,840
I see him, Snake.

592
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:39,430
He's right here! Let's go! Move!

593
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:43,560
Let's move! Move!

594
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,360
Oh, shit.

595
01:02:46,440 --> 01:02:49,780
- Come on! We'll give you a hand! - We're moving on board!

596
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,910
All right, get that ammo off and get the wounded on!

597
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:55,530
Bring 'em on! Get 'em on, boys!

598
01:03:02,170 --> 01:03:03,830
No, we're overloaded!

599
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:05,670
- Leave him! - I'll get out! It's Ray!

600
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,260
He's hurt worse than me!

601
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,130
You hang on! I'll see you back there, Ray!

602
01:03:37,370 --> 01:03:39,700
You, me and Ouellette are all we have in reserve.

603
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,330
Yeah, but it's slacking up a little.

604
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:46,000
No, they're just regrouping for another assault.

605
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,170
Distribute that ammo.

606
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:52,340
Ouellette, tell Crandall he's got time to get one more flight in here.

607
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,380
Yes, sir.

608
01:03:57,050 --> 01:03:59,970
Doc, you give this water to the wounded.

609
01:04:02,140 --> 01:04:05,060
Running out of water. Must be terrible for 'em.

610
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:08,230
Those guys are cut off out there.

611
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,030
Running low on ammo, Sarge!

612
01:04:16,110 --> 01:04:18,950
Pick your target. One shot, one kill.

613
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:21,700
- Roger that, Sarge. - How we doin', Doc?

614
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,830
Ernie, we're out of water.

615
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:27,170
That's the last of it.

616
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:43,770
My face is on fire! Help!

617
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:46,310
Foster, hold still! Hold still!

618
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,190
I'll cut your face! Hold still!

619
01:05:02,540 --> 01:05:04,670
Doc, Doc, it's Foster!

620
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:06,000
Okay.

621
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:10,420
Does anybody have any more bandages?

622
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:29,070
Ernie, you hit too? You hit?

623
01:05:29,150 --> 01:05:30,530
No, no, I'm okay.

624
01:05:30,610 --> 01:05:32,860
Our guys are gonna come for us, aren't they?

625
01:05:35,450 --> 01:05:36,740
Yeah.

626
01:05:36,780 --> 01:05:38,410
When?

627
01:05:40,450 --> 01:05:42,080
Plug his wound.

628
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:47,540
That's the main LZ, but it's closed.

629
01:05:57,590 --> 01:05:59,850
Go! Move!

630
01:06:02,310 --> 01:06:06,060
Go, Parker! Get up in there! This is too Tall. I'm clear...

631
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:08,440
Crandall's clear...

632
01:06:13,650 --> 01:06:15,030
Colonel!

633
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:18,820
Go over and reinforce that company! On that ridge there! Look!

634
01:06:18,870 --> 01:06:21,490
Yes, sir! Okay! Keep your head down!

635
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,040
To the top of the ridge! Move it!

636
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,170
Come on, let's move! Move!

637
01:06:31,340 --> 01:06:32,750
Run! Come on!

638
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:43,770
Captain Nadal, we've got to break through to that cutoff platoon!

639
01:06:44,810 --> 01:06:47,560
We got an American platoon out there.

640
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:50,610
An Air Cav platoon cut off out there!

641
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:52,150
Air Cav!

642
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,400
Garry Owen!

643
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:14,380
He said, "Really? Me too." I said, "I know.

644
01:07:14,420 --> 01:07:17,380
Your mama asked me to give you $600."

645
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,430
Good luck to you.

646
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,690
Hey, you got enough room for one more?

647
01:07:29,770 --> 01:07:32,730
If you're crazy enough, get in. Yes, sir.

648
01:07:49,410 --> 01:07:52,040
Hey, what are those lights down there?

649
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,000
Enemy soldiers.

650
01:07:55,090 --> 01:07:57,050
They use candles on the trail.

651
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:00,470
They're moving into position to attack.

652
01:08:03,890 --> 01:08:05,850
Here we go!

653
01:08:27,830 --> 01:08:32,290
Unload that shit! Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go!

654
01:08:37,340 --> 01:08:40,420
You and your boys have done a hell of a job today, Snake.

655
01:08:41,170 --> 01:08:45,800
It's the last flight for the night, but you need us, you call us.

656
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:52,440
Who in the hell are you? I'm a reporter, sir.

657
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:54,810
Yeah.

658
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:57,270
Joe Galloway, UPI. How's it going, Colonel?

659
01:08:57,360 --> 01:09:00,740
We've been flat to the boards since last night, and we're outnumbered.

660
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:05,700
More enemy coming too. I saw a chain of lights coming down the mountain.

661
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,950
Is that so? Yes, sir.

662
01:09:08,030 --> 01:09:10,330
Well, I can't guarantee your safety.

663
01:09:10,410 --> 01:09:12,500
Yes, sir, I know.

664
01:09:12,580 --> 01:09:15,540
Where you from, son? Refugio, Texas, sir.

665
01:09:15,630 --> 01:09:18,920
Well, that's the first thing I heard all day that makes any sense.

666
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:22,420
Captain, you see those lights coming down the trails on the mountain?

667
01:09:22,510 --> 01:09:25,510
On it right now, sir. You fry them sons of bitches.

668
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:27,470
Whiskey-Six, this is Trojan-Three. Fire mission.

669
01:09:27,550 --> 01:09:31,520
Tango Foxtrot: 4-niner-6-5-6-niner.

670
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,190
All operations are suspended for the evening.

671
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,950
Morning operations will be scheduled for 0530 hours.

672
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,060
Where's Crandall?

673
01:10:17,100 --> 01:10:19,690
Where's Crandall? He's right there, sir.

674
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:23,230
You led my men into a hot LZ.

675
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:24,990
Somebody had to fly out the wounded.

676
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:27,950
Don't you play hotshot with me. You know the rules.

677
01:10:28,030 --> 01:10:30,740
You suckered us in there. Do it again, I'll have you busted!

678
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:34,750
You got the balls to face me, but not the balls to face the enemy?

679
01:10:35,830 --> 01:10:37,750
Get outta here. Whoa!

680
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:40,540
I ever see you again, I'll kill you.

681
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:45,800
That's right.

682
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:56,430
Quite a day, huh?

683
01:11:01,770 --> 01:11:03,730
Tomorrow will be worse.

684
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:09,280
If they make it to tomorrow.

685
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:22,090
Ernie, it's pitch black. I can't see anything, but I can smell 'em.

686
01:11:23,210 --> 01:11:24,880
Dead bodies stink, Bungum.

687
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:28,340
No, it's not the dead ones. I can smell them crawling up on us.

688
01:11:29,430 --> 01:11:31,340
I'm telling you.

689
01:11:35,970 --> 01:11:40,100
I need illumination, 6-5-0, 1-5-0.

690
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:00,710
I need artillery on previously established targets!

691
01:12:00,790 --> 01:12:04,130
Alpha, Bravo and Charlie! Fire for effect!

692
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:06,130
Fire for effect!

693
01:12:08,590 --> 01:12:11,680
Save your ammo! Cease fire!

694
01:12:12,760 --> 01:12:13,850
Is anybody hit?

695
01:12:15,890 --> 01:12:19,180
Captain, if you guys are coming you gotta let us know.

696
01:12:19,230 --> 01:12:22,190
It's pitch black out here. I don't wanna shoot any of our own guys.

697
01:12:24,270 --> 01:12:25,690
Savage...

698
01:12:26,940 --> 01:12:28,900
we can't make it tonight.

699
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:34,320
Don't worry. You're gonna make it.

700
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,580
We'll come get you in the morning.

701
01:12:40,120 --> 01:12:41,790
Yes, sir.

702
01:12:43,120 --> 01:12:44,540
Out.

703
01:13:38,930 --> 01:13:41,100
You're doing a fine job, son.

704
01:13:41,140 --> 01:13:44,690
Don't worry. We gave them more than they gave us today.

705
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,360
How you boys doing? Fine, sir.

706
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:50,530
You keep doing what you're doing, we'll be fine.

707
01:13:51,610 --> 01:13:55,490
Your men have done a hell of a job today, Lieutenant Geoghegan.

708
01:13:55,570 --> 01:13:58,320
They won't get through us, sir. You can count on it.

709
01:13:58,410 --> 01:14:00,080
I know that, Jack.

710
01:14:00,160 --> 01:14:01,580
Keep it up, son.

711
01:14:03,620 --> 01:14:05,870
It's Rear Headquarters, sir.

712
01:14:05,960 --> 01:14:07,290
How is it out there, Colonel?

713
01:14:07,330 --> 01:14:09,540
We're surrounded, but we're holding on, sir.

714
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:14,630
Sir, I need a confirmed count of our dead and wounded.

715
01:14:14,720 --> 01:14:17,260
I got to know where all my boys are.

716
01:14:17,300 --> 01:14:18,550
You'll get it, Hal.

717
01:14:22,680 --> 01:14:23,850
Here they come.

718
01:14:23,930 --> 01:14:25,140
Captain Edwards.

719
01:14:26,980 --> 01:14:28,310
We need illumination on the perimeter.

720
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,520
Whiskey-Five, this is Hot Wire-Six-Alpha.

721
01:14:30,610 --> 01:14:33,280
We need illumination now.

722
01:15:09,270 --> 01:15:10,730
Kathy?

723
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,540
A telegram.

724
01:15:30,330 --> 01:15:33,380
A cab delivers a telegram.

725
01:15:33,460 --> 01:15:36,590
"The Secretary of the Army...

726
01:15:38,380 --> 01:15:39,340
regrets..."

727
01:16:38,440 --> 01:16:39,740
Mrs. Moore?

728
01:16:39,820 --> 01:16:41,740
Colonel Moore's wife?

729
01:16:44,030 --> 01:16:45,160
Yes.

730
01:16:46,870 --> 01:16:49,330
I need help finding an address.

731
01:16:50,660 --> 01:16:53,000
I'm looking for... You jackass!

732
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:57,500
Do you know what this is? Do you know what you just did to me?

733
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:12,390
I don't like this job, ma'am.

734
01:17:13,810 --> 01:17:15,730
I'm just trying to do it.

735
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:21,360
Wait.

736
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,740
Wait.

737
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,910
I'll take it to her.

738
01:17:35,960 --> 01:17:39,300
And tell the cab company, if there are any others, just bring them to me.

739
01:17:50,680 --> 01:17:52,350
Julie.

740
01:17:52,430 --> 01:17:54,690
I just went by to see Catherine.

741
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,190
Everybody knows.

742
01:17:57,400 --> 01:17:59,860
No chaplains or counselors? Cab drivers?

743
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,860
The Army wasn't ready.

744
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:07,070
I'll go with you.

745
01:18:07,160 --> 01:18:09,080
Thanks. Who's it for?

746
01:18:51,490 --> 01:18:53,410
I thought she would hate me.

747
01:18:54,910 --> 01:18:57,460
Your husband didn't start the war.

748
01:18:57,540 --> 01:19:00,460
They all knew this could happen, and so did we.

749
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:24,320
I'll take care of this.

750
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,320
I'll go with you.

751
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,870
We'll do one at a time. Okay?

752
01:19:33,080 --> 01:19:34,490
We won't look.

753
01:19:34,580 --> 01:19:36,000
Okay.

754
01:20:32,050 --> 01:20:33,850
Julie...

755
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,850
do you think there'll be more telegrams tomorrow?

756
01:20:40,350 --> 01:20:42,810
If there are, come and get me.

757
01:21:02,830 --> 01:21:06,290
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost, amen.

758
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,380
Out of the depths I cry unto Thee, O Lord.

759
01:21:11,420 --> 01:21:13,380
Lord, hear my voice.

760
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:19,140
Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.

761
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:21,930
Thou, O Lord, shall mark our inequities.

762
01:21:23,690 --> 01:21:25,610
Lord, who can abide them?

763
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,570
With Thee there is mercy.

764
01:21:33,030 --> 01:21:35,620
Grant them eternal rest, O Lord...

765
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:38,120
and may perpetual light shine upon them.

766
01:21:39,450 --> 01:21:43,580
And through the mercy of God, may they rest in peace. Amen.

767
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,630
In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost.

768
01:21:53,260 --> 01:21:55,680
Do you got a death wish, Galloway?

769
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,800
No, sir.

770
01:21:57,890 --> 01:21:59,810
Well, then why are you here?

771
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:06,650
'Cause I knew these dead boys would be here, sir.

772
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:17,660
Why aren't you a soldier?

773
01:22:17,780 --> 01:22:19,660
You got the guts for it.

774
01:22:19,700 --> 01:22:21,700
My daddy was a soldier.

775
01:22:21,790 --> 01:22:25,920
My granddaddy, two of my great-granddaddies was soldiers.

776
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,880
Hell, that's how I came to be.

777
01:22:28,670 --> 01:22:31,420
Each of them lost a leg in the Civil War.

778
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:34,090
My Great-granddaddy Galloway, he lost his left...

779
01:22:34,130 --> 01:22:37,090
and my Great-granddaddy Reid lost his right.

780
01:22:38,550 --> 01:22:41,510
They met in a shoe store in Galveston.

781
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:44,850
Every year after that, same date, same store, they'd get together...

782
01:22:44,930 --> 01:22:47,850
and pick out a new pair of shoes for the two of them.

783
01:22:47,940 --> 01:22:49,860
You are shittin' me. No, sir.

784
01:22:49,940 --> 01:22:51,360
I swear to God.

785
01:22:52,900 --> 01:22:56,490
Anyway, one had a daughter, one had a son... my grandparents.

786
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:59,990
What do you suppose the odds of them having the same shoe size was?

787
01:23:02,160 --> 01:23:05,580
I don't know, Colonel. It was meant to be, I guess.

788
01:23:05,620 --> 01:23:07,080
Yeah.

789
01:23:08,330 --> 01:23:09,750
Meant to be.

790
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:15,380
Sir, Galloways have been in every war this country's ever fought.

791
01:23:15,470 --> 01:23:19,890
But when it came to this one, I didn't think I could stop the war.

792
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:23,810
I just thought maybe I might try and understand one.

793
01:23:24,890 --> 01:23:28,020
Maybe help folks back home understand.

794
01:23:30,650 --> 01:23:33,150
I just figure I could do that better...

795
01:23:33,230 --> 01:23:35,900
shooting a camera than I could shooting a rifle.

796
01:23:39,320 --> 01:23:40,740
Well...

797
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:45,950
I sure hope you make it through this one.

798
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:47,460
You too, Colonel.

799
01:25:41,070 --> 01:25:42,990
Right 20!

800
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:01,590
Put it right on 'em!

801
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:19,080
Colonel, sir.

802
01:27:21,340 --> 01:27:23,670
Captain Nadal. Sir.

803
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:30,090
What is it, sir?

804
01:27:30,180 --> 01:27:32,260
Nothing's wrong, except there's nothing wrong.

805
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:41,940
Best get back to the termite mound. You'll be fine. Go on.

806
01:27:41,980 --> 01:27:43,980
Roger that, sir. Come on!

807
01:27:44,070 --> 01:27:46,240
All right, pass the word on.

808
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,240
Every man fire three rounds at anything that looks suspicious.

809
01:27:50,320 --> 01:27:51,740
On my signal.

810
01:28:14,430 --> 01:28:17,350
They're gonna hit us like this along the whole perimeter.

811
01:28:17,430 --> 01:28:19,390
We gotta get back to that termite mound.

812
01:28:19,440 --> 01:28:20,730
Better hang here, sir!

813
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:23,560
Shit.

814
01:28:27,320 --> 01:28:28,990
We need a medic!

815
01:28:35,620 --> 01:28:37,410
Sir! Sir!

816
01:28:37,500 --> 01:28:39,750
Captain Edwards, Charlie Company, on the ridge.

817
01:28:39,830 --> 01:28:41,290
Bob.

818
01:28:41,330 --> 01:28:42,920
They're inside the artillery!

819
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:44,380
I need...

820
01:29:12,030 --> 01:29:13,740
I need a grenade!

821
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:28,000
Go, Willie! Come on, let's go!

822
01:29:33,680 --> 01:29:35,220
Godboldt down!

823
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:39,890
I'll get him!

824
01:29:47,150 --> 01:29:48,570
Willie!

825
01:30:03,460 --> 01:30:04,830
Get those guys help!

826
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:09,670
Captain Dillon, get Bravo Company to send a platoon across the LZ...

827
01:30:09,750 --> 01:30:11,840
and support Charlie Company.

828
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:14,510
Bravo-Six, this is Trojan-Three.

829
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:17,760
And tell Charlie Company to get real small in their holes.

830
01:30:17,850 --> 01:30:20,680
I'm gonna drop some artillery right on top of'em!

831
01:30:20,770 --> 01:30:22,020
Charlie Company, get small.

832
01:30:22,100 --> 01:30:24,690
We got AT coming right on top of your position.

833
01:30:24,770 --> 01:30:26,480
We're being overrun!

834
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:29,190
Nah, boys! We're gonna win this fight.

835
01:31:15,650 --> 01:31:19,780
Yes, sir, they brought a main force of VC battalion against us too.

836
01:31:19,870 --> 01:31:22,830
Colonel, I request you dispatch another company of reinforcements...

837
01:31:22,910 --> 01:31:26,910
for movement as soon as it can be accomplished without undue risk.

838
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,460
Done. How bad is it, Hal?

839
01:31:34,420 --> 01:31:36,630
It's getting pretty sporty down here, sir.

840
01:31:39,050 --> 01:31:41,140
Get out of the way!

841
01:31:50,610 --> 01:31:53,110
Medic! Get a medic over here!

842
01:31:57,530 --> 01:32:00,870
What's your name, soldier? Jimmy Nakayama.

843
01:32:00,950 --> 01:32:02,870
I got a baby being born today.

844
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:05,160
Oh, wow! Congratulations! Thanks!

845
01:32:09,830 --> 01:32:11,210
Medic!

846
01:32:11,290 --> 01:32:13,460
Medic!

847
01:32:16,300 --> 01:32:18,550
Can't take no pictures lying down there, sonny.

848
01:32:21,890 --> 01:32:23,550
Down, right there.

849
01:32:28,430 --> 01:32:30,230
I'm a noncombatant, sir.

850
01:32:30,310 --> 01:32:32,360
Ain't no such thing today, boy.

851
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:38,360
Shit.

852
01:32:40,450 --> 01:32:42,570
Why aren't those mortars firing?

853
01:32:42,620 --> 01:32:44,700
What's the problem here?

854
01:32:44,740 --> 01:32:46,200
These tubes are red hot, sir.

855
01:32:46,240 --> 01:32:49,000
I'm afraid we're gonna cook a round off and blow us all up.

856
01:32:49,040 --> 01:32:52,000
We can't cool 'em off 'cause we're all out of water.

857
01:32:58,210 --> 01:33:00,300
Come on! What are you waiting for?

858
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:02,260
Jimmy, come on.

859
01:33:03,300 --> 01:33:05,180
Go, go, go.

860
01:33:05,220 --> 01:33:07,520
Yeah, one more.

861
01:33:29,200 --> 01:33:30,910
Gentlemen...

862
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,040
prepare to defend yourselves.

863
01:33:43,340 --> 01:33:44,550
Grenade!

864
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,230
Negative! Negative! Stand by!

865
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:39,440
My pilots do not see the enemy. They cannot pick out our friendlies.

866
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:41,150
Bravo-Six, say again.

867
01:34:41,230 --> 01:34:44,490
You gotta tell your company commander to pop smoke now.

868
01:34:44,530 --> 01:34:47,910
They need to mark the lines now! We have no lines!

869
01:34:47,950 --> 01:34:51,200
We have enemies and friendlies mixed in all over the place.

870
01:34:51,290 --> 01:34:53,250
Sir, our perimeter is collapsing.

871
01:34:53,330 --> 01:34:55,580
Alpha Company and Bravo Company cannot hold.

872
01:34:55,620 --> 01:34:57,580
Charlie Company is being overrun.

873
01:35:00,380 --> 01:35:02,510
Net call! Net call!

874
01:35:02,590 --> 01:35:04,510
Keep this net clear!

875
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:21,860
Hastings!

876
01:35:25,990 --> 01:35:27,530
Broken arrow!

877
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:32,370
Broken arrow!

878
01:35:32,450 --> 01:35:35,540
I say again! Broken arrow!

879
01:35:35,620 --> 01:35:37,710
We have broken arrow! We have broken arrow!

880
01:35:37,790 --> 01:35:39,290
Confirm. Broken arrow.

881
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:41,250
Broken arrow confirmed.

882
01:35:41,290 --> 01:35:42,460
Broken arrow?

883
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,630
That means that an American unit has been overrun.

884
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:47,470
It calls in every combat aircraft for support.

885
01:35:47,510 --> 01:35:50,640
My God, there's no hiding it now.

886
01:36:11,950 --> 01:36:14,660
Charlie Company, report! Signal is out!

887
01:36:14,660 --> 01:36:16,870
Bravo Company, report!

888
01:36:16,950 --> 01:36:20,920
Roger that! Planes are on their way, Colonel!

889
01:36:21,750 --> 01:36:22,880
Sir!

890
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:28,340
Roger that!

891
01:36:39,440 --> 01:36:41,850
We have planes at every 1,000 feet...

892
01:36:41,900 --> 01:36:44,940
from 7,000 to 35,000... we'll get 'em, sir!

893
01:36:47,030 --> 01:36:50,410
Advancing north on our position at 1-5-0.

894
01:37:08,550 --> 01:37:10,800
Nine-six-two-five-zero-seven--

895
01:37:18,220 --> 01:37:21,100
They're getting closer in on 3-1-5 degrees!

896
01:37:21,140 --> 01:37:24,980
That's 0-5-0! Repeat, 0-5-0!

897
01:37:31,150 --> 01:37:32,530
Goddamn it.

898
01:37:44,210 --> 01:37:48,300
Company sighted out in the open, advancing north on our position.

899
01:37:48,380 --> 01:37:51,670
They're advancing on 3-1-5 degrees at 1-5-0.

900
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:56,850
Bring it closer in on 3-1-5 degrees at 0-5-0...

901
01:37:56,930 --> 01:37:59,930
Charlie, call that son of a bitch off!

902
01:37:59,970 --> 01:38:01,980
Call an abort now!

903
01:38:02,060 --> 01:38:02,980
Pull up!

904
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:07,020
Get down!

905
01:38:34,130 --> 01:38:36,840
Charlie, listen to me. You're keeping us alive now.

906
01:38:36,930 --> 01:38:39,850
You forget about that one and you keep 'em coming in.

907
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:41,520
You're doing well, son.

908
01:38:43,980 --> 01:38:45,980
Seven-oh-two...

909
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:48,020
Attack against the tree line.

910
01:38:58,950 --> 01:39:01,620
Medic! Medic!

911
01:39:16,300 --> 01:39:19,430
Oh, God! Jimmy. You know this guy?

912
01:39:19,470 --> 01:39:21,640
You know him? Talk to him. Just talk to him!

913
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,430
Jimmy, do you hear me?

914
01:39:24,520 --> 01:39:26,690
It's Joe. It's Joe Galloway.

915
01:39:26,770 --> 01:39:30,110
Doc's giving you morphine. We're gonna get you out of here.

916
01:39:36,740 --> 01:39:39,740
We gotta get him to the landing zone. Grab his legs!

917
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:54,840
You gotta get him out of here. Hey! Hey!

918
01:39:54,880 --> 01:39:57,840
I can't help you! You gotta do it by yourself!

919
01:39:57,930 --> 01:40:00,470
Get him on that chopper, okay? Yes, sir.

920
01:40:59,490 --> 01:41:01,860
Tell my wife I love her...

921
01:41:01,950 --> 01:41:04,030
and my baby!

922
01:41:04,120 --> 01:41:06,580
You tell'em!

923
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:34,210
Captain Nadal. Sir...

924
01:42:34,290 --> 01:42:36,830
Now that we put 'em back on their heels, we got us a lull.

925
01:42:36,920 --> 01:42:38,250
I want you to attack.

926
01:42:38,340 --> 01:42:41,090
I want you to go over there and rescue that cut off platoon.

927
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:44,260
Yes, sir! First Squad, move out!

928
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:48,180
Come on, guys. Move it!

929
01:42:52,430 --> 01:42:53,730
Add fifty.

930
01:42:54,350 --> 01:42:56,350
Keep moving the artillery forward!

931
01:42:56,440 --> 01:42:58,770
Keep walking the artillery forward!

932
01:42:58,860 --> 01:42:59,940
Spread it out!

933
01:43:03,860 --> 01:43:05,990
Move it!

934
01:43:08,450 --> 01:43:11,240
Move it! Keep moving forward!

935
01:43:27,180 --> 01:43:29,680
Sergeant Savage, you guys still here?

936
01:43:48,160 --> 01:43:50,830
We have 40 KIA, we have two MIA.

937
01:43:50,910 --> 01:43:52,830
These are the latest numbers. Over.

938
01:44:22,650 --> 01:44:26,280
That's a nice day, Sergeant Savage.

939
01:44:34,290 --> 01:44:37,330
Forty dead, two unaccounted for, sir.

940
01:44:37,410 --> 01:44:39,250
Right.

941
01:44:40,120 --> 01:44:43,000
All right, boys, let's get 'em up and get 'em out.

942
01:44:51,800 --> 01:44:54,720
Let's get 'em out of here and get 'em on the chopper!

943
01:44:57,730 --> 01:45:00,440
Since most of the men being loaded on the chopper...

944
01:45:00,520 --> 01:45:01,900
are from Charlie Company...

945
01:45:01,940 --> 01:45:03,480
I want you to take their place.

946
01:45:03,560 --> 01:45:07,280
I'll show you where. Follow me. Yes, sir! Let's go!

947
01:46:05,130 --> 01:46:07,670
Captain, have your men dig some firing steps.

948
01:46:07,750 --> 01:46:09,920
Throw some dirt on those bodies, keep the smell down.

949
01:46:10,010 --> 01:46:11,880
Roger, Sergeant Major.

950
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:16,100
Kind of makes you wish you'd signed up for submarines, don't it?

951
01:46:16,180 --> 01:46:20,680
Brigade headquarters wants you out on the first chopper at dawn.

952
01:46:20,770 --> 01:46:24,400
What idiot would keep ordering that in the middle of a goddamn battle?

953
01:46:24,440 --> 01:46:27,440
Gen. Westmoreland wants a briefing. Give me the horn.

954
01:46:28,230 --> 01:46:29,980
I am in a fight...

955
01:46:30,070 --> 01:46:32,990
and I object to this order to return to Saigon.

956
01:46:33,070 --> 01:46:35,240
Now, I will not leave my men.

957
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:37,280
Is that clear? Out.

958
01:46:44,870 --> 01:46:46,790
There's two of my men unaccounted for out there...

959
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:48,800
and it's where the worst of the fighting was...

960
01:46:48,880 --> 01:46:50,670
so they'll be out there someplace.

961
01:46:50,760 --> 01:46:53,550
Let's go out and get 'em. I'm with you, sir.

962
01:46:53,590 --> 01:46:55,090
All right.

963
01:46:55,180 --> 01:46:56,680
Let's go.

964
01:48:49,830 --> 01:48:51,790
They...

965
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:53,540
brought another...

966
01:48:53,630 --> 01:48:55,710
Oh, God, Julie. Julie, it's yours.

967
01:49:43,850 --> 01:49:46,180
He died keeping my promise.

968
01:50:17,210 --> 01:50:19,170
Sir, they're ordering us all out.

969
01:50:19,260 --> 01:50:21,630
All of us.

970
01:50:21,670 --> 01:50:24,050
They're gonna march reinforcements in.

971
01:50:24,090 --> 01:50:26,600
They don't understand a damn thing, do they?

972
01:50:27,390 --> 01:50:28,930
Can't get out.

973
01:50:31,930 --> 01:50:34,350
He's waiting up there in a cave, and that's what he wants.

974
01:50:34,440 --> 01:50:36,610
The minute he sees live soldiers hopping on a helicopter...

975
01:50:36,690 --> 01:50:39,530
he'll be all over us and then he'll get what he wants.

976
01:50:39,570 --> 01:50:41,860
He'll get his massacre.

977
01:50:50,450 --> 01:50:53,120
Requesting permission to rejoin the lines, sir.

978
01:50:56,880 --> 01:50:58,590
All right, son.

979
01:51:02,670 --> 01:51:04,720
Garry Owen, sir.

980
01:51:27,320 --> 01:51:30,080
I wonder what was going through Custer's mind when he realized...

981
01:51:30,160 --> 01:51:32,450
he'd led his men into a slaughter.

982
01:51:34,120 --> 01:51:36,870
Sir, Custer was a pussy.

983
01:51:38,880 --> 01:51:40,630
You ain't.

984
01:51:43,510 --> 01:51:45,130
Goddamn.

985
01:51:50,220 --> 01:51:51,680
Hell.

986
01:51:55,180 --> 01:51:57,350
Right now they're planning their final attack...

987
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,520
the one that will finish us off.

988
01:52:00,400 --> 01:52:02,860
They'll nibble at us all night, then...

989
01:52:02,900 --> 01:52:05,950
come dawn they'll hit us with everything they got.

990
01:52:07,490 --> 01:52:10,070
That's what I'd do if I was him.

991
01:52:15,120 --> 01:52:18,750
Sergeant Major, hand out the last of the ammunition.

992
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:20,750
Yes, sir.

993
01:53:41,620 --> 01:53:43,040
Fix bayonets.

994
01:58:00,800 --> 01:58:03,340
You were wondering how Custer felt, sir.

995
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:06,560
You ought to ask him.

996
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:26,900
Sergeant Savage!

997
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:37,870
Checking the dead enemies for documents...

998
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:40,500
and I found this on the guy that tried to bayonet you.

999
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:43,170
Translated some of it, mostly personal.

1000
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:45,840
Thought you might wanna have a look at it.

1001
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:20,630
What was that? It's American artillery.

1002
02:01:23,380 --> 02:01:25,170
Friendly fire.

1003
02:01:25,250 --> 02:01:27,170
How many casualties?

1004
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:32,050
What the hell happened here, Joe?

1005
02:01:36,720 --> 02:01:38,310
Hey, Joe.

1006
02:01:40,060 --> 02:01:42,110
Colonel Moore!

1007
02:01:44,520 --> 02:01:46,780
Colonel! Colonel Moore!

1008
02:01:49,820 --> 02:01:52,370
What is the key to your victory? Sir, tell us how you feel.

1009
02:01:52,450 --> 02:01:54,620
Do you feel the States will be forced...

1010
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:56,660
to take the North Vietnamese more seriously?

1011
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:59,660
How do you feel about the loss of your men, sir?

1012
02:01:59,750 --> 02:02:02,500
Have you notified the families, sir?

1013
02:03:17,740 --> 02:03:19,660
I'm glad you made it, son.

1014
02:03:20,790 --> 02:03:23,120
Thank you, sir. You too.

1015
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:30,050
I'll never forgive myself.

1016
02:03:32,420 --> 02:03:34,180
For what, sir?

1017
02:03:39,180 --> 02:03:41,100
That my men...

1018
02:03:44,940 --> 02:03:47,440
That my men died and I didn't.

1019
02:04:09,710 --> 02:04:11,880
Sir, I don't...

1020
02:04:11,960 --> 02:04:14,630
I don't know how to tell this story.

1021
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:18,260
Well, you got to, Joe.

1022
02:04:20,140 --> 02:04:23,020
You tell the American people what these men did here.

1023
02:04:27,730 --> 02:04:29,980
You tell 'em how my troopers died.

1024
02:04:36,610 --> 02:04:38,200
Yes, sir.

1025
02:04:42,740 --> 02:04:44,370
Thank you.

1026
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:35,460
All of our men, living and dead, are off the field, sir.

1027
02:05:35,550 --> 02:05:37,470
Well done, Sergeant Major.

1028
02:07:34,790 --> 02:07:37,960
In Saigon, Hal Moore's superiors congratulated him...

1029
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:40,960
for killing over 1,800 enemy soldiers.

1030
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:44,680
Then ordered him to lead the men of the 7th Cavalry...

1031
02:07:44,720 --> 02:07:47,140
back into the Valley of Death.

1032
02:07:47,220 --> 02:07:49,100
He led them...

1033
02:07:49,180 --> 02:07:51,310
and fought beside them...

1034
02:07:51,350 --> 02:07:53,980
for 235 more days.

1035
02:08:15,830 --> 02:08:18,750
Kids, go to bed. Isn't there someone at the door?

1036
02:08:18,840 --> 02:08:21,000
Go to bed!

1037
02:09:01,250 --> 02:09:04,590
Children, your daddy's home! Daddy!

1038
02:09:10,600 --> 02:09:13,510
Some had families waiting.

1039
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:17,310
For others, their only family would be the men they bled beside.

1040
02:09:17,390 --> 02:09:21,310
There were no bands, no flags...

1041
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:23,980
no honor guards to welcome them home.

1042
02:09:25,230 --> 02:09:28,740
They went to war because their country ordered them to.

1043
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:31,820
But in the end they fought not for their country or their flag.

1044
02:09:33,280 --> 02:09:35,580
They fought for each other...

1045
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:41,130
Dear Barbara...

1046
02:09:41,210 --> 02:09:46,210
I have no words to express to you my sadness of the loss of Jack.

1047
02:09:47,550 --> 02:09:50,050
The world is a lesser place without him.

1048
02:09:51,140 --> 02:09:53,810
But I know he is with God and the angels.

1049
02:09:53,890 --> 02:09:57,730
And even heaven is improved by his presence there.

1050
02:09:59,190 --> 02:10:01,310
I know you, too, are sure of this...

1051
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:04,980
and yet this knowledge can't diminish his loss...

1052
02:10:05,070 --> 02:10:06,940
and your grief.

1053
02:10:07,990 --> 02:10:11,280
With abiding respect and affection, Hal Moore.

1054
02:10:24,420 --> 02:10:26,590
We who have seen war...

1055
02:10:26,670 --> 02:10:28,920
will never stop seeing it.

1056
02:10:31,590 --> 02:10:35,390
In the silence of the night, we will always hear the screams.

1057
02:10:39,560 --> 02:10:41,810
So this is our story...

1058
02:10:43,310 --> 02:10:46,020
for we were soldiers once...

1059
02:10:46,110 --> 02:10:48,030
and young.
