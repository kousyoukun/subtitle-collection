1
00:03:49,066 --> 00:03:51,186
Dick Laurent is dead.

2
00:05:34,255 --> 00:05:37,095
You don't mind that
I'm not coming tonight?

3
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:41,693
What are you going to do?

4
00:05:43,534 --> 00:05:45,812
Stay home, read.

5
00:05:49,253 --> 00:05:50,133
Read?

6
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:01,931
Read?

7
00:06:04,092 --> 00:06:05,652
Read what, Renee?

8
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:15,331
It's nice to know
I can still make you laugh.

9
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,449
I like to laugh, Fred.

10
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:26,689
That's why I married you.

11
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:34,210
You can wake me up when
you get home if you want to.

12
00:10:06,586 --> 00:10:07,706
What is that?

13
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,905
A videotape.

14
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:21,104
I found it outside on the steps.

15
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:26,304
Who's it from?

16
00:10:27,505 --> 00:10:28,704
I don't know.

17
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:32,863
There isn't anything on the envelope.

18
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:38,623
Does it say anything on the tape?

19
00:10:44,023 --> 00:10:45,542
No. Nothing.

20
00:10:48,702 --> 00:10:50,902
Well, see what's on it.

21
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,740
Come on.

22
00:11:45,896 --> 00:11:48,455
Must be from a real estate agent.

23
00:11:50,456 --> 00:11:51,655
Maybe.

24
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:14,675
It's OK.

25
00:15:15,715 --> 00:15:17,354
It's OK.

26
00:15:18,474 --> 00:15:19,994
It's OK.

27
00:16:08,669 --> 00:16:10,868
I had a dream last night.

28
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:16,708
You were inside the house...

29
00:16:25,827 --> 00:16:27,706
You were calling my name...

30
00:16:32,107 --> 00:16:32,986
Fred!

31
00:16:38,345 --> 00:16:39,065
Fred!

32
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:42,545
Where are you.

33
00:16:48,584 --> 00:16:50,464
I couldn't find you.

34
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,702
Then there you were...

35
00:17:10,982 --> 00:17:12,423
... Iying in bed.

36
00:17:13,621 --> 00:17:15,261
It wasn't you.

37
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:19,701
It looked like you, but it wasn't.

38
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:44,579
Fred, are you all right?

39
00:18:48,733 --> 00:18:50,772
You're up early.

40
00:18:51,892 --> 00:18:53,692
That dog woke me.

41
00:19:04,251 --> 00:19:06,771
Who the hell owns that dog?

42
00:19:17,808 --> 00:19:19,129
What's that?

43
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:25,889
Another videotape.

44
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:27,728
Yes.

45
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,446
Don't you want to watch it?

46
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:45,246
I guess so.

47
00:20:01,644 --> 00:20:03,365
Well, don't you want to watch it?

48
00:20:04,364 --> 00:20:05,324
Yeah.

49
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:18,363
It's the same thing.

50
00:20:24,042 --> 00:20:25,242
No, it isn't.

51
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:34,320
Fred?

52
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,719
What?

53
00:21:01,158 --> 00:21:03,598
We have to call the police.

54
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:05,639
That's right. Yes.

55
00:21:11,156 --> 00:21:16,676
Someone broke in and taped us
while we slept. Isn't that enough?

56
00:21:19,156 --> 00:21:21,195
7035 Hollis.

57
00:21:22,716 --> 00:21:25,076
Near the observatory.

58
00:21:26,795 --> 00:21:27,436
Yes.

59
00:21:29,395 --> 00:21:30,835
We'll be here.

60
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:36,674
So?

61
00:21:38,155 --> 00:21:40,034
They're sending 2 detectives out.

62
00:21:55,953 --> 00:21:57,073
That's it.

63
00:21:58,112 --> 00:21:59,311
What do you think.

64
00:21:59,872 --> 00:22:01,992
I really don't know.

65
00:22:10,951 --> 00:22:13,591
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.

66
00:22:35,989 --> 00:22:37,468
This is the bedroom?

67
00:22:38,667 --> 00:22:41,788
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.

68
00:22:45,187 --> 00:22:46,987
This is our bedroom.

69
00:22:50,066 --> 00:22:51,787
There's no other bedroom?

70
00:22:53,587 --> 00:22:54,786
No.

71
00:22:56,945 --> 00:23:01,145
I mean, I use it as a practice room.

72
00:23:02,066 --> 00:23:03,426
It's soundproof.

73
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:05,025
You're a musician?

74
00:23:06,465 --> 00:23:07,184
Yeah.

75
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:09,306
What's your axe?

76
00:23:09,505 --> 00:23:11,944
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.

77
00:23:13,504 --> 00:23:16,144
- Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.

78
00:23:17,584 --> 00:23:19,144
Do you own a video camera?

79
00:23:19,344 --> 00:23:19,984
No.

80
00:23:22,143 --> 00:23:23,663
Fred hates them.

81
00:23:30,542 --> 00:23:33,422
I like to remember things my own way.

82
00:23:34,662 --> 00:23:36,021
What do you mean by that?

83
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:43,102
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.

84
00:23:47,301 --> 00:23:49,020
You have an alarm system?

85
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,781
Yes. Actually, we do.

86
00:23:52,381 --> 00:23:55,060
But we haven't been using it lately.

87
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:57,140
Why not?

88
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,179
It kept going off...

89
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,698
For some reason. False alarms.

90
00:24:08,418 --> 00:24:10,298
Might want to try and use it again.

91
00:24:11,138 --> 00:24:12,258
Yeah.

92
00:24:15,138 --> 00:24:16,098
OK?

93
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:22,897
We're going to check the windows and doors,
see if anybody tried to break in.

94
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:37,529
-We'll keep watch over the house.
-We'll do the best we can.

95
00:25:39,449 --> 00:25:42,649
-If anything else happens, you'll call us.
-We will.

96
00:25:44,528 --> 00:25:47,649
-Thanks, guys.
-It's what we do.

97
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:24,884
Hey, Andy! Welcome to my party.

98
00:26:25,765 --> 00:26:28,044
-You look ravishing.
-Thank you.

99
00:26:42,203 --> 00:26:42,844
Fred!

100
00:26:44,842 --> 00:26:45,882
Please!

101
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,042
Please!

102
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:52,201
Hey!

103
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:11,040
-2 double scotches, neat.
-OK.

104
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:02,995
We've met before, haven't we?

105
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,953
I don't think so.

106
00:28:10,513 --> 00:28:13,074
Where was it you think we met?

107
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:16,832
At your house. Don't you remember?

108
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:21,913
No. No, I don't.

109
00:28:23,232 --> 00:28:24,592
Are you sure?

110
00:28:25,392 --> 00:28:26,871
Of course.

111
00:28:28,311 --> 00:28:32,432
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.

112
00:28:37,071 --> 00:28:40,510
What do you mean? You're where right now?

113
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:44,670
At your house.

114
00:28:48,229 --> 00:28:50,510
That's fucking crazy, man!

115
00:28:58,708 --> 00:29:00,508
Call me!

116
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:08,108
Dial your number!

117
00:29:12,068 --> 00:29:13,188
Go ahead!

118
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:27,665
I told you I was here.

119
00:29:30,985 --> 00:29:32,504
How'd you do that?

120
00:29:35,944 --> 00:29:37,584
Ask me!

121
00:29:43,664 --> 00:29:45,103
How'd you get inside my house?

122
00:29:45,304 --> 00:29:50,904
You invited me. It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.

123
00:29:51,983 --> 00:29:53,022
Who are you?

124
00:29:54,143 --> 00:29:55,103
Hm.

125
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:02,662
Give me back my phone.

126
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,421
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

127
00:30:33,578 --> 00:30:36,699
-I thought you were getting me a drink.
-Hang on just a minute.

128
00:30:37,618 --> 00:30:42,218
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?

129
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:46,657
I don't know his name. He's
a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

130
00:30:51,456 --> 00:30:53,017
Dick Laurent?

131
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:56,096
Yeah. I believe so.

132
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:04,175
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

133
00:31:06,696 --> 00:31:07,975
He is?

134
00:31:09,335 --> 00:31:13,214
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

135
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,934
I don't.

136
00:31:19,054 --> 00:31:20,615
I don't know him.

137
00:31:21,333 --> 00:31:23,215
Dick can't be dead.

138
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:25,893
Who told you he was dead?

139
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:29,814
Who, honey?
Who's dead?

140
00:31:32,292 --> 00:31:33,852
Let's go home.

141
00:31:34,053 --> 00:31:36,253
-But...
-Now. We're leaving now.

142
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:41,332
We never should have come here in the first place.

143
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:51,371
So, how'd you meet that asshole Andy anyway?

144
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,010
It was a long time ago.

145
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:01,689
We met at a place called Moke's.

146
00:32:03,289 --> 00:32:05,088
We became friends.

147
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:07,688
He told me about a job.

148
00:32:08,688 --> 00:32:09,809
What job?

149
00:32:12,888 --> 00:32:14,529
I don't remember.

150
00:32:16,449 --> 00:32:19,408
Anyway...Andy's OK.

151
00:32:23,087 --> 00:32:25,287
Well, He's got some pretty fucked-up friends.

152
00:32:34,925 --> 00:32:36,326
Hey!..
Hey!..

153
00:32:37,846 --> 00:32:39,206
Stay in the car.

154
00:34:04,357 --> 00:34:06,237
I told you to stay in the car.

155
00:34:06,437 --> 00:34:09,636
Why? What is it?

156
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:13,076
Why did you make me stay out here?

157
00:34:15,596 --> 00:34:19,115
I'll tell you why, because I thought someone was inside the house.

158
00:34:21,915 --> 00:34:24,276
Was there?

159
00:34:26,154 --> 00:34:27,955
No, of course not.

160
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:07,897
Fred?

161
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:17,897
Fred, where are you?

162
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,638
Renee!

163
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:09,679
Renee!

164
00:40:10,318 --> 00:40:12,279
Sit down, Killer!

165
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:18,557
I didn't kill her.

166
00:40:21,477 --> 00:40:23,517
Tell me I didn't kill her.

167
00:40:36,556 --> 00:40:40,915
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

168
00:40:47,155 --> 00:40:51,593
Fred Madison, the jury having found
you guilty of murder in the first degree,

169
00:40:51,835 --> 00:40:55,354
it is my order that you be put to death in the electric chair.

170
00:41:08,232 --> 00:41:12,432
Make yourself to home, fella.

171
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:21,910
Stick your hand out, chief.

172
00:43:31,097 --> 00:43:32,217
Something wrong?

173
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:39,017
It's...my head.

174
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:05,374
You sleeping OK?

175
00:44:06,334 --> 00:44:06,974
No.

176
00:44:08,774 --> 00:44:10,814
I can't sleep.

177
00:44:58,409 --> 00:44:59,968
You'll sleep now.

178
00:45:01,529 --> 00:45:03,729
Take him back to his cell.

179
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:06,367
Let's go.

180
00:45:18,086 --> 00:45:18,728
Guard!

181
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:23,647
Guard!

182
00:45:35,924 --> 00:45:36,565
Guard!

183
00:45:42,324 --> 00:45:42,884
Hey!

184
00:45:46,403 --> 00:45:47,523
What do you want?

185
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:52,003
Aspirin.
My head.

186
00:45:54,562 --> 00:45:56,283
Hey! Hey!

187
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:12,641
Shit. That wife killer's looking pretty fucked up.

188
00:46:13,281 --> 00:46:14,801
Which one?

189
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:58,669
Pete!

190
00:47:59,550 --> 00:48:01,029
Please don't go!

191
00:48:02,509 --> 00:48:03,149
No. Pete!

192
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:05,429
Pete!..Pete!..Pete!
Wait a minute!

193
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:33,100
Fuck me!

194
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,898
All right. What's the situation?

195
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,058
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

196
00:50:02,497 --> 00:50:03,457
Right here.

197
00:50:08,736 --> 00:50:10,457
That's not Fred Madison.

198
00:50:12,616 --> 00:50:14,335
No, Sir. It's not.

199
00:50:18,575 --> 00:50:21,214
-Who is it?
-I couldn't say, Sir.

200
00:50:23,295 --> 00:50:24,494
Captain Luneau?

201
00:50:25,215 --> 00:50:26,253
Yeah, Mike?

202
00:50:27,213 --> 00:50:27,934
Captain...

203
00:50:28,695 --> 00:50:31,053
This is some spooky shit we got here.

204
00:50:40,373 --> 00:50:43,253
Well, Gentlemen, we know who the stranger is.

205
00:50:44,773 --> 00:50:47,733
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.

206
00:50:48,452 --> 00:50:51,652
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft

207
00:50:52,332 --> 00:50:54,931
for which he was put on probation for 1 year.

208
00:50:55,972 --> 00:51:02,651
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.

209
00:51:52,565 --> 00:51:53,205
So...

210
00:52:33,241 --> 00:52:35,440
-Here.
-Thanks, Lou.

211
00:54:22,791 --> 00:54:25,349
Where the fuck have you been, man?

212
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:27,509
-Hey! -Hiya. -Hi.
-Hey, guy.

213
00:54:28,710 --> 00:54:31,149
-Hey, man.
-What's up man?

214
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:34,309
Well, you look like shit.

215
00:54:34,508 --> 00:54:35,948
Yeah. What happened?

216
00:54:37,628 --> 00:54:39,508
Just haven't been feeling so good.

217
00:54:39,707 --> 00:54:41,588
You're not contagious, are you?

218
00:54:41,788 --> 00:54:43,308
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.

219
00:54:43,507 --> 00:54:45,388
All right. Well, let's go for a drive then.

220
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:48,227
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.

221
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:51,626
It takes many strawberries to fill a bucket.

222
00:54:51,827 --> 00:54:54,628
But it's worth it when you know that...

223
00:54:54,908 --> 00:54:56,226
-Come on.
-Hoh.

224
00:54:56,666 --> 00:54:57,946
Come on. I'll lead.

225
00:54:58,266 --> 00:55:01,627
...and a glass of fresh, cold milk from grandmother's cow.

226
00:55:03,946 --> 00:55:04,746
See ya later.

227
00:55:05,665 --> 00:55:09,185
-I'm gonna go out with these clowns for a while.
-That should do you some good.

228
00:55:10,505 --> 00:55:14,785
-Good night. -See ya.
-Good night.

229
00:55:42,661 --> 00:55:44,300
What's happening to you?

230
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,781
What happened to your face?

231
00:55:49,461 --> 00:55:52,181
-I don't know?
-What do you mean, you don't know?

232
00:55:53,301 --> 00:55:55,581
You've been acting strange lately.

233
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:57,420
Like the other night.

234
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,060
What night?

235
00:56:01,699 --> 00:56:03,899
The last time I saw you.

236
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:06,178
I don't remember.

237
00:56:17,179 --> 00:56:18,819
You still care about me?

238
00:56:44,335 --> 00:56:44,974
Pete!

239
00:56:47,855 --> 00:56:49,654
-Arnie!
-Where you been?

240
00:56:49,894 --> 00:56:52,334
-How you doing?
-It's good you're back...

241
00:56:52,575 --> 00:56:55,213
...Wonderful.
-Good to see you, man.

242
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:56,053
Listen, man, a lot of people...

243
00:56:56,293 --> 00:56:59,493
...gonna be real happy that you're back, including me.

244
00:56:59,733 --> 00:57:01,253
Well, it's good to be back.

245
00:57:01,454 --> 00:57:03,493
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.

246
00:57:03,692 --> 00:57:04,973
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

247
00:57:05,173 --> 00:57:07,692
And Mr. Eddy called.

248
00:57:07,893 --> 00:57:11,931
-Can I call him and tell him to come in?
-Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.

249
00:57:12,572 --> 00:57:15,412
-And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
-You're ready to work?
-Yeah.

250
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:17,891
-Well, let's go to work.
-All right, Buddy.

251
00:57:21,372 --> 00:57:22,891
Petey's back!

252
00:57:40,090 --> 00:57:41,610
There's 9 People down here.

253
00:57:42,528 --> 00:57:47,129
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...

254
00:57:47,689 --> 00:57:50,128
...I'll let you ask the other 2.

255
00:57:59,287 --> 00:58:00,646
Hey, Pete!

256
00:58:03,846 --> 00:58:04,806
Pete!

257
00:58:07,646 --> 00:58:08,606
Where's Pete?

258
00:58:09,927 --> 00:58:11,206
He's back there!

259
00:58:11,406 --> 00:58:12,206
Mr. Eddy!

260
00:58:13,925 --> 00:58:14,966
Hey!

261
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:20,244
What happened?

262
00:58:21,085 --> 00:58:22,564
-Somebody giving you trouble?
-No. No trouble.

263
00:58:22,765 --> 00:58:26,365
'Cause if somebody's giving you trouble, Pete,...

264
00:58:26,605 --> 00:58:29,244
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that!

265
00:58:29,444 --> 00:58:33,644
-No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
-I mean it, Pete. Like...that!

266
00:58:33,884 --> 00:58:36,163
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...

267
00:58:36,363 --> 00:58:40,043
...just a regular tune-up?
-I want you to take a ride with me.

268
00:58:40,644 --> 00:58:42,762
I don't like the sound of something.

269
00:58:42,963 --> 00:58:46,881
-OK. I got to check in with the boss.
-It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.

270
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:22,879
Pull it over, but keep it running.

271
00:59:43,436 --> 00:59:45,797
Best goddamn ears in town.

272
01:00:00,035 --> 01:00:01,675
Give that a try.

273
01:00:07,674 --> 01:00:12,593
Beautiful...Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.

274
01:00:15,273 --> 01:00:18,313
-Let's take a ride.
-Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

275
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:33,551
It's a beautiful day.

276
01:00:40,591 --> 01:00:42,469
-You did a great job, Pete.
-Yeah.

277
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:46,390
Well, you know I like working on this car, Mr. Eddy.

278
01:01:02,908 --> 01:01:06,507
Shit. That cocksucker doing what I think he's doing?

279
01:01:36,704 --> 01:01:38,184
This is where mechanical excellence...

280
01:01:38,385 --> 01:01:41,904
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.

281
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,741
Ahh...Oh, oh, God!

282
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:27,099
Don't you ever fucking tailgate!

283
01:02:27,579 --> 01:02:29,379
-Ever!
-Tell him you won't tailgate.

284
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:30,378
Ever!

285
01:02:30,779 --> 01:02:33,899
-I won't ever...
-Do you know how many fucking car lengths it takes...

286
01:02:34,139 --> 01:02:37,178
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?!

287
01:02:37,377 --> 01:02:40,738
6 fucking car lengths!
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister!

288
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:44,178
If I had to stop suddenly, you would've hit me!

289
01:02:44,377 --> 01:02:48,737
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual!
I want you to study that motherfucker!

290
01:02:48,977 --> 01:02:51,177
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules!

291
01:02:51,376 --> 01:02:55,136
50 fucking thousand people were
killed on the highway last

292
01:02:55,376 --> 01:02:58,136
Because of fucking assholes like you!

293
01:02:58,655 --> 01:03:04,496
-Tell me you're going to get a manual!
-I will ge-get a manual.

294
01:03:07,096 --> 01:03:08,735
Fucking ldiot!

295
01:03:08,975 --> 01:03:11,934
Oh!.Aah!.Oh, Gooood!

296
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,451
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

297
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:55,930
But tailgating is one thing I cannot tolerate.

298
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,209
Yeah, I can see that.

299
01:04:09,609 --> 01:04:10,489
Wait a minute!

300
01:04:15,727 --> 01:04:18,009
-Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
-No, thank you.

301
01:04:18,528 --> 01:04:20,488
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

302
01:04:22,688 --> 01:04:24,127
You like pornos?

303
01:04:24,328 --> 01:04:26,686
-Pornos?
-Give you a boner?

304
01:04:27,807 --> 01:04:30,487
Uh, No, No thanks. No.

305
01:04:31,086 --> 01:04:32,526
Suit yourself, champ.

306
01:04:33,726 --> 01:04:37,565
-Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
-You will.

307
01:04:43,884 --> 01:04:45,326
Damn!

308
01:04:53,004 --> 01:04:55,964
Lou, you recognize that guy?

309
01:04:58,164 --> 01:05:00,524
Yeah...Laurent.

310
01:06:08,876 --> 01:06:12,556
-What do you want?
-Want to go for a drive?

311
01:06:14,275 --> 01:06:15,556
I don't know.

312
01:06:17,235 --> 01:06:18,874
Get in, Baby!

313
01:06:40,114 --> 01:06:40,914
Come here!

314
01:07:22,268 --> 01:07:25,789
-Why don't you like me?
-I do like you.

315
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:27,708
How much?

316
01:08:34,261 --> 01:08:35,581
Oh, Pete!

317
01:08:41,701 --> 01:08:42,421
Sheila!

318
01:08:44,940 --> 01:08:46,380
Sheila!

319
01:09:27,335 --> 01:09:29,135
What'd you change it for?

320
01:09:30,135 --> 01:09:31,255
I like that.

321
01:09:32,534 --> 01:09:33,815
Well, I don't.

322
01:09:43,334 --> 01:09:44,733
I like that!

323
01:10:18,530 --> 01:10:21,290
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

324
01:10:21,529 --> 01:10:24,170
-Think you'll get a chance to give her the once-over today?
-Sure.

325
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:27,650
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?

326
01:10:28,330 --> 01:10:31,609
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

327
01:10:31,889 --> 01:10:35,408
-It'll be done.
-You're my man, Pete.

328
01:12:18,437 --> 01:12:22,118
Don't let that thing upset you.

329
01:12:47,595 --> 01:12:50,475
Holy smokes!

330
01:13:16,111 --> 01:13:17,152
Hey!

331
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:20,952
I'm Alice Wakefield.

332
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:23,110
Pete Dayton.

333
01:13:25,191 --> 01:13:28,310
-I was here earlier.
-Yeah, I remember.

334
01:13:35,190 --> 01:13:37,390
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

335
01:13:39,269 --> 01:13:40,989
I don't know.

336
01:13:46,708 --> 01:13:47,828
OK.

337
01:13:49,308 --> 01:13:51,429
Why don't I take you to dinner?

338
01:13:54,067 --> 01:13:57,988
Look, I don't think this is a very good idea.

339
01:14:05,307 --> 01:14:06,746
Do you have a phone?

340
01:14:09,786 --> 01:14:10,746
Yeah.

341
01:14:11,746 --> 01:14:13,786
It's right...lt's right there.

342
01:14:14,626 --> 01:14:17,265
I have to call myself another taxi.

343
01:14:27,424 --> 01:14:29,304
Hello? Van Nuys?

344
01:14:29,744 --> 01:14:33,423
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

345
01:14:46,462 --> 01:14:50,422
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...

346
01:14:51,262 --> 01:14:54,621
Hello. Yeah, we're not going to need that cab.
Thanks.

347
01:15:10,661 --> 01:15:13,540
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

348
01:15:45,736 --> 01:15:47,137
Take my clothes off!

349
01:15:51,215 --> 01:15:54,055
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

350
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:45,850
-I want more.
-Me, too.

351
01:16:50,570 --> 01:16:56,170
-Can I call you?
-Yeah. Call me at home. I'll give you the number.

352
01:17:02,368 --> 01:17:03,328
OK, Baby.

353
01:17:30,685 --> 01:17:35,686
Hey! Up here.Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.

354
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:11,722
I'll get it.
Hello?

355
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:15,640
Meow, meow.It's me.

356
01:18:15,880 --> 01:18:17,321
Hey, Baby.

357
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,400
I can't see you tonight.

358
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:25,840
OK.

359
01:18:27,479 --> 01:18:29,679
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.

360
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,159
Sure.

361
01:18:34,159 --> 01:18:39,078
I think he suspects something. We have to be careful.

362
01:18:42,038 --> 01:18:43,597
I miss you.

363
01:18:47,358 --> 01:18:48,237
Pete?

364
01:18:49,678 --> 01:18:50,996
Me, too.

365
01:18:52,796 --> 01:18:54,757
I'll call you again.

366
01:20:29,266 --> 01:20:30,828
What a fucking job.

367
01:20:31,627 --> 01:20:33,267
His or ours, Lou?

368
01:20:35,225 --> 01:20:36,266
Ours, Hank.

369
01:21:00,783 --> 01:21:03,223
-Hey.
-Sit down a minute!

370
01:21:04,143 --> 01:21:06,703
-What's up?
-Sit down!

371
01:21:09,262 --> 01:21:10,902
You don't look so good.

372
01:21:11,503 --> 01:21:14,621
No, I just...just have a headache.

373
01:21:16,022 --> 01:21:17,542
What's going on?

374
01:21:19,102 --> 01:21:20,900
The police called us.

375
01:21:23,061 --> 01:21:23,941
What'd they want?

376
01:21:24,181 --> 01:21:29,541
They want to know if we had a chance
to find out what happened to you the other night.

377
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:33,260
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

378
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:39,380
But I don't remember anything.

379
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,179
What'd you tell them?

380
01:21:48,498 --> 01:21:50,698
We're not going to say anything...

381
01:21:51,217 --> 01:21:53,417
...about that night to the police.

382
01:21:56,258 --> 01:21:58,538
We saw you that night, Pete.

383
01:22:01,857 --> 01:22:04,137
You came home with your friend Sheila.

384
01:22:06,297 --> 01:22:07,016
Sheila?

385
01:22:10,296 --> 01:22:12,736
Yeah. There was a man with you.

386
01:22:13,735 --> 01:22:17,415
What is this? I mean, why didn't you tell me anything?

387
01:22:22,495 --> 01:22:23,935
Who's the man?

388
01:22:25,494 --> 01:22:28,694
I've never seen him before in my life.

389
01:22:33,934 --> 01:22:35,574
What happened to me?

390
01:22:38,453 --> 01:22:41,573
Please, please, Dad, Tell me!

391
01:22:59,651 --> 01:23:00,771
Hey, Pete! Hey!

392
01:23:02,130 --> 01:23:03,171
Hey!

393
01:23:14,409 --> 01:23:15,129
Hey!

394
01:23:16,289 --> 01:23:17,089
Mr. Eddy.

395
01:23:27,448 --> 01:23:29,488
Hey, Pete!

396
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:32,327
-How you doing?
-I'm OK.

397
01:23:32,528 --> 01:23:35,408
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

398
01:23:35,648 --> 01:23:38,687
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.

399
01:23:39,606 --> 01:23:44,207
Her name is Alice.I swear,
I love that girl to death.

400
01:23:46,727 --> 01:23:50,846
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

401
01:23:53,166 --> 01:23:54,966
I'd take this

402
01:23:55,205 --> 01:23:59,205
and I'd shove it so far up his ass,
it would come out his mouth.

403
01:23:59,404 --> 01:24:02,685
-And then you know what I'd do?
-What?

404
01:24:03,526 --> 01:24:06,244
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

405
01:24:13,084 --> 01:24:16,963
Hey. You're looking good.

406
01:24:17,962 --> 01:24:19,762
What you been up to?

407
01:24:29,201 --> 01:24:30,241
I'll get it.

408
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:32,962
Hello?

409
01:24:35,121 --> 01:24:41,360
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

410
01:24:46,680 --> 01:24:47,801
He'll kill us.

411
01:24:51,558 --> 01:24:52,919
Are you...

412
01:24:55,319 --> 01:24:57,038
...positive that he knows?

413
01:24:57,239 --> 01:25:00,119
I'm not positive, but he knows.

414
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:08,197
So...What are we supposed to do?

415
01:25:11,117 --> 01:25:12,597
I don't know.

416
01:25:42,394 --> 01:25:47,514
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

417
01:25:51,913 --> 01:25:53,553
I know a guy.

418
01:25:55,993 --> 01:25:59,113
He pays girls to party with him.

419
01:25:59,791 --> 01:26:01,512
He's always got a lot of cash.

420
01:26:03,032 --> 01:26:04,831
He'd be easy to rob.

421
01:26:06,311 --> 01:26:10,752
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.

422
01:26:12,671 --> 01:26:14,871
We could be together.

423
01:26:23,070 --> 01:26:24,790
Have you partied with him?

424
01:26:31,069 --> 01:26:32,428
Did you like it?

425
01:26:34,468 --> 01:26:35,508
No.

426
01:26:36,468 --> 01:26:37,829
It was part of the deal.

427
01:26:39,069 --> 01:26:40,108
What deal?

428
01:26:44,228 --> 01:26:46,668
-He works for Mr. Eddy.
-Yeah?

429
01:26:47,427 --> 01:26:50,466
-And what's he do?
-He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

430
01:26:51,267 --> 01:26:54,467
-Pornos?
-Yeah.

431
01:26:55,546 --> 01:26:57,986
How did you get in with these
fucking people, Alice?

432
01:26:58,186 --> 01:27:01,865
-Pete...
-No. Pete. I want to know how it happened.

433
01:27:06,425 --> 01:27:08,465
It was a long time ago.

434
01:27:10,145 --> 01:27:14,184
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

435
01:27:15,785 --> 01:27:17,745
He told me about a job.

436
01:27:22,904 --> 01:27:24,184
In pornos?

437
01:27:27,264 --> 01:27:32,262
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.

438
01:27:35,182 --> 01:27:38,701
He made an appointment for me to see a man.

439
01:27:39,742 --> 01:27:41,262
I went to this place.

440
01:27:43,821 --> 01:27:45,621
They made me wait there forever.

441
01:27:48,022 --> 01:27:50,300
There was a guy guarding the door.

442
01:27:54,621 --> 01:27:57,381
In another room, there was this
other guy lifting weights.

443
01:28:04,299 --> 01:28:06,099
I started getting nervous.

444
01:28:08,418 --> 01:28:10,778
When it got dark...

445
01:28:11,898 --> 01:28:15,018
...they brought me into this other room.

446
01:30:33,204 --> 01:30:35,564
Why didn't you just leave?

447
01:30:43,482 --> 01:30:45,602
You liked it, huh?

448
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:54,321
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.

449
01:30:59,641 --> 01:31:01,761
I don't want you to go away.

450
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:03,960
I don't want you to go away.

451
01:31:14,279 --> 01:31:16,159
I love you, Alice.

452
01:31:20,199 --> 01:31:22,639
-Should I call Andy?
-Andy?

453
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:27,358
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

454
01:31:28,318 --> 01:31:30,957
Yeah. Call him.

455
01:31:33,717 --> 01:31:35,838
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

456
01:31:36,477 --> 01:31:38,757
You meet me at his place at 11:00.

457
01:31:39,156 --> 01:31:43,756
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.

458
01:31:44,436 --> 01:31:50,355
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.

459
01:31:50,556 --> 01:31:53,435
It's a white Stucco job
on the south side of the street.

460
01:31:53,676 --> 01:31:58,275
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.

461
01:31:58,634 --> 01:32:02,234
Go through the kitchen into the living room.
There's a bar there.

462
01:32:02,555 --> 01:32:06,675
At 11:15, I'll send Andy down to fix me a drink.

463
01:32:06,873 --> 01:32:10,473
And when he does,
you crack him on the head, OK?

464
01:32:14,313 --> 01:32:14,952
OK.

465
01:32:43,870 --> 01:32:46,470
-You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
-Sheila!

466
01:32:46,669 --> 01:32:48,950
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila! Sheila, stop it!

467
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:51,269
-You don't call. Who is she?
-Stop it!

468
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:54,309
-What's the bitch's name?
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?

469
01:32:54,509 --> 01:32:56,069
-Go home!
-You're sorry?
-Sheila, stop it!

470
01:32:56,309 --> 01:32:58,269
You're sorry, you piece of shit!

471
01:32:58,468 --> 01:32:59,868
-You're sorry?
-Go home!

472
01:33:00,069 --> 01:33:02,108
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila, stop, Sheila!
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!

473
01:33:02,388 --> 01:33:04,828
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila...Sheila.

474
01:33:05,148 --> 01:33:09,187
Sheila! Let's both go in and talk about this quietly.

475
01:33:09,587 --> 01:33:11,107
Sheila, come on.

476
01:33:13,467 --> 01:33:15,667
-You are different.
-Sheila!

477
01:33:15,987 --> 01:33:18,186
Tell him!..Tell him!

478
01:33:18,387 --> 01:33:21,106
Sheila, don't. Don't.

479
01:33:22,506 --> 01:33:29,186
I don't care anymore anyway. I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

480
01:33:29,746 --> 01:33:35,584
I won't bother you, or any member
of your family ever again.

481
01:33:49,663 --> 01:33:50,702
Pete?

482
01:33:53,622 --> 01:33:55,183
There's a man on the phone.

483
01:33:56,423 --> 01:33:58,862
He's called a couple of times tonight.

484
01:33:59,542 --> 01:34:00,582
Who is it?

485
01:34:02,621 --> 01:34:04,182
He won't give his name.

486
01:34:22,621 --> 01:34:23,739
Hello?

487
01:34:24,459 --> 01:34:26,899
Hey, Pete, how you doing?

488
01:34:29,139 --> 01:34:33,259
-Who is this?
-You know who it is.

489
01:34:36,619 --> 01:34:37,938
Mr. Eddy?

490
01:34:38,857 --> 01:34:41,738
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

491
01:34:42,498 --> 01:34:46,258
-OK.
-You're doing OK? That's good, Pete.

492
01:34:48,177 --> 01:34:54,257
-Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
-I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.

493
01:34:56,376 --> 01:35:02,135
-You're sure you're OK? Everything all right?
-Yeah.

494
01:35:04,095 --> 01:35:07,375
I'm really glad to know you're doing good, Pete. Hey!

495
01:35:08,454 --> 01:35:10,336
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.

496
01:35:15,774 --> 01:35:18,214
We've met before, haven't we?

497
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:20,974
I don't think so.

498
01:35:23,094 --> 01:35:25,054
Where is it you think we've met?

499
01:35:25,373 --> 01:35:29,133
At your house. Don't you remember?

500
01:35:32,732 --> 01:35:36,492
No. No, I don't.

501
01:35:37,892 --> 01:35:40,571
In the East, the far East...

502
01:35:40,772 --> 01:35:46,092
...when a person is sentenced to death,
they're sent to a place where they can't escape.

503
01:35:46,691 --> 01:35:53,531
Never knowing when an executioner may step up behind them
and fire a bullet into the back of their head.

504
01:35:54,809 --> 01:35:56,530
What's going on?

505
01:35:57,170 --> 01:35:59,690
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

506
01:36:00,609 --> 01:36:05,849
Pete, I just wanted to jump on and
tell you that I'm really glad you're doing OK.

507
01:39:13,590 --> 01:39:14,709
You got him.

508
01:39:15,869 --> 01:39:16,989
Alice!

509
01:40:11,943 --> 01:40:12,744
Wow!

510
01:40:16,383 --> 01:40:18,023
We killed him.

511
01:40:26,743 --> 01:40:28,782
You killed him.

512
01:40:31,781 --> 01:40:32,421
Alice?

513
01:40:37,981 --> 01:40:39,181
Alice?

514
01:40:40,581 --> 01:40:42,060
What do we do?

515
01:40:43,421 --> 01:40:45,060
What do we do?

516
01:40:46,300 --> 01:40:47,940
We have to get the stuff.

517
01:40:50,420 --> 01:40:51,899
We have to get out of here.

518
01:41:06,977 --> 01:41:08,097
Ah, fuck!

519
01:41:43,053 --> 01:41:44,013
Is that you?

520
01:41:45,653 --> 01:41:47,094
Are both of them you?

521
01:41:56,372 --> 01:41:57,653
That's me.

522
01:42:00,292 --> 01:42:02,652
Honey, are you all right?

523
01:42:07,492 --> 01:42:09,011
Where's the bathroom?

524
01:42:10,411 --> 01:42:13,171
It's upstairs, down the hall.

525
01:43:08,365 --> 01:43:10,086
Did you want to talk to me?

526
01:43:12,925 --> 01:43:15,804
Did you want to ask me, why?

527
01:44:11,359 --> 01:44:12,479
What's the matter?

528
01:44:16,078 --> 01:44:17,518
Don't you trust me, Pete?

529
01:44:26,037 --> 01:44:28,077
Stick this in your pants.

530
01:44:35,115 --> 01:44:37,317
I know a fence.

531
01:44:39,875 --> 01:44:44,474
He'll give us money, get us passports
in exchange for all this shit

532
01:44:45,355 --> 01:44:46,554
and Andy's car...

533
01:44:47,954 --> 01:44:50,595
And then we can go anywhere.

534
01:45:05,353 --> 01:45:06,632
Come on, Baby!

535
01:45:22,470 --> 01:45:23,672
Pete, you drive!

536
01:45:38,869 --> 01:45:41,309
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

537
01:45:43,829 --> 01:45:45,789
Where the fuck are we going?

538
01:45:48,509 --> 01:45:50,628
We have to go to the desert, Baby.

539
01:45:53,068 --> 01:45:55,428
The fence I told you about...

540
01:45:59,267 --> 01:46:00,747
He's at his cabin.

541
01:47:12,020 --> 01:47:12,980
Come on!

542
01:47:59,015 --> 01:48:00,814
We'll have to wait.

543
01:48:20,972 --> 01:48:23,572
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?

544
01:48:31,051 --> 01:48:33,171
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

545
01:48:36,851 --> 01:48:38,891
More than ever.

546
01:50:35,239 --> 01:50:36,359
I want you.

547
01:50:45,117 --> 01:50:46,398
I want you.

548
01:51:04,195 --> 01:51:05,315
I want you.

549
01:51:07,235 --> 01:51:08,355
I want you.

550
01:51:26,912 --> 01:51:30,913
You'll never have me.

551
01:52:33,066 --> 01:52:34,026
Here I am.

552
01:53:23,621 --> 01:53:29,701
-Where's Alice?
-Alice who? Her name is Renee.

553
01:53:29,940 --> 01:53:33,540
If she told you her name is Alice, she's lying.

554
01:53:37,499 --> 01:53:41,579
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?!

555
01:56:56,079 --> 01:56:56,718
Renee?

556
01:57:06,717 --> 01:57:08,718
You're coming with me.

557
01:59:06,505 --> 01:59:09,105
What do you guys want?

558
02:00:21,097 --> 02:00:22,977
Now you can hand it back!

559
02:00:32,377 --> 02:00:34,496
You and me, Mister...

560
02:00:37,535 --> 02:00:41,416
We can really outugly them sumbitches...

561
02:00:42,334 --> 02:00:43,974
Can't we?

562
02:01:37,690 --> 02:01:40,049
Ed...Take a look at this!

563
02:01:46,729 --> 02:01:48,607
Yeah. That's her all right.

564
02:01:49,968 --> 02:01:53,328
That's Fred Madison's wife with Dick Laurent.

565
02:01:53,728 --> 02:01:55,608
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.

566
02:01:57,167 --> 02:01:59,607
We got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.

567
02:02:00,527 --> 02:02:02,247
You know what I think, Ed?

568
02:02:04,006 --> 02:02:05,887
What is it, AI? What do you think?

569
02:02:07,246 --> 02:02:09,886
I think there's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

570
02:03:10,800 --> 02:03:12,280
Dick Laurent is dead.
