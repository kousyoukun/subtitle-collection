1
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,040
Dick Laurent is dead.

2
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,970
You don't mind that
I'm not coming tonight?

3
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:41,570
What are you going to do?

4
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,690
Stay home, read.

5
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,010
Read?

6
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,810
Read?

7
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,530
Read what, Renee?

8
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:15,210
It's nice to know 
I can still make you laugh.

9
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:18,330
I like to laugh, Fred.

10
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,570
That's why I married you.

11
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:34,090
You can wake me up when
you get home if you want to.

12
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,610
What is that?

13
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,810
A videotape.

14
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,010
I found it outside on the steps.

15
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,210
Who's it from?

16
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,620
I don't know.

17
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,770
There isn't anything on the envelope.

18
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,540
Does it say anything on the tape?

19
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,460
No. Nothing.

20
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,820
Well, see what's on it.

21
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,660
Come on.

22
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,380
Must be from a real estate agent.

23
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,580
Maybe.

24
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,620
It's OK.

25
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,300
It's OK.

26
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,940
It's OK.

27
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,820
I had a dream last night.

28
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,660
You were inside the house...

29
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:27,660
You were calling my name...

30
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:32,950
Fred!

31
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,030
Fred!

32
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:42,510
Where are you.

33
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,430
I couldn't find you.

34
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,670
Then there you were...

35
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,390
... Iying in bed.

36
00:17:13,590 --> 00:17:15,230
It wasn't you.

37
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,670
It looked like you, but it wasn't.

38
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:44,550
Fred, are you all right?

39
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:50,750
You're up early.

40
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,670
That dog woke me.

41
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,750
Who the hell owns that dog?

42
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,110
What's that?

43
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,870
Another videotape.

44
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:27,710
Yes.

45
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,430
Don't you want to watch it?

46
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,230
I guess so.

47
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,350
Well, don't you want to watch it?

48
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,310
Yeah.

49
00:20:16,870 --> 00:20:18,350
It's the same thing.

50
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,230
No, it isn't.

51
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,310
Fred?

52
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,710
What?

53
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,590
We have to call the police.

54
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,630
That's right. Yes.

55
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:16,670
Someone broke in and taped us
while we slept. Isn't that enough?

56
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,190
7035 Hollis.

57
00:21:22,710 --> 00:21:25,070
Near the observatory.

58
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:27,430
Yes.

59
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:30,830
We'll be here.

60
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,670
So?

61
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,030
They're sending 2 detectives out.

62
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,070
That's it.

63
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,310
What do you think.

64
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,990
I really don't know.

65
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:13,590
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.

66
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,480
This is the bedroom?

67
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:41,800
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.

68
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,000
This is our bedroom.

69
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,800
There's no other bedroom?

70
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,800
No.

71
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,160
I mean, I use it as a practice room.

72
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,440
It's soundproof.

73
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,040
You're a musician?

74
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,200
Yeah.

75
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,320
What's your axe?

76
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,960
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.

77
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,160
- Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.

78
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,160
Do you own a video camera?

79
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,000
No.

80
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,680
Fred hates them.

81
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,440
I like to remember things my own way.

82
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,040
What do you mean by that?

83
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,120
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.

84
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,040
You have an alarm system?

85
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,800
Yes. Actually, we do.

86
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,080
But we haven't been using it lately.

87
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,160
Why not?

88
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,200
It kept going off...

89
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,720
For some reason. False alarms.

90
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,320
Might want to try and use it again.

91
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:12,280
Yeah.

92
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,120
OK?

93
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,920
We're going to check the windows and doors,
see if anybody tried to break in.

94
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:37,560
-We'll keep watch over the house.
-We'll do the best we can.

95
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,680
-If anything else happens, you'll call us.
-We will.

96
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,680
-Thanks, guys.
-It's what we do.

97
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,920
Hey, Andy! Welcome to my party.

98
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:28,080
-You look ravishing.
-Thank you.

99
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:42,880
Fred!

100
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:45,920
Please!

101
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,080
Please!

102
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,240
Hey!

103
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,080
-2 double scotches, neat.
-OK.

104
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,040
We've met before, haven't we?

105
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,000
I don't think so.

106
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,120
Where was it you think we met?

107
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,880
At your house. Don't you remember?

108
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,970
No. No, I don't.

109
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,640
Are you sure?

110
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,920
Of course.

111
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:32,490
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.

112
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:40,570
What do you mean? You're where right now?

113
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,730
At your house.

114
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,570
That's fucking crazy, man!

115
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,570
Call me!

116
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,170
Dial your number!

117
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:13,250
Go ahead!

118
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:27,730
I told you I was here.

119
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:32,570
How'd you do that?

120
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:37,650
Ask me!

121
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,170
How'd you get inside my house?

122
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,970
You invited me. It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.

123
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:53,090
Who are you?

124
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,170
Hm.

125
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:02,730
Give me back my phone.

126
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,490
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

127
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,770
-I thought you were getting me a drink.
-Hang on just a minute.

128
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:42,290
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?

129
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:46,730
I don't know his name. He's
a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

130
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,090
Dick Laurent?

131
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:56,170
Yeah. I believe so.

132
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:04,250
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

133
00:31:06,770 --> 00:31:08,050
He is?

134
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:13,290
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

135
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:18,010
I don't.

136
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,690
I don't know him.

137
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:23,290
Dick can't be dead.

138
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,970
Who told you he was dead?

139
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:29,890
Who, honey?
Who's dead?

140
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,930
Let's go home.

141
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,330
-But...
-Now. We're leaving now.

142
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:41,410
We never should have come here in the first place.

143
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:51,450
So, how'd you meet that asshole Andy anyway?

144
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,090
It was a long time ago.

145
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,770
We met at a place called Moke's.

146
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:05,170
We became friends.

147
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,770
He told me about a job.

148
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,890
What job?

149
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:14,610
I don't remember.

150
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:19,490
Anyway...Andy's OK.

151
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,370
Well, He's got some pretty fucked-up friends.

152
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,410
Hey!..
Hey!..

153
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:39,290
Stay in the car.

154
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:06,330
I told you to stay in the car.

155
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:09,730
Why? What is it?

156
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:13,170
Why did you make me stay out here?

157
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:19,210
I'll tell you why, because I thought someone was inside the house.

158
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:24,380
Was there?

159
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,060
No, of course not.

160
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,020
Fred?

161
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,020
Fred, where are you?

162
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,780
Renee!

163
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,820
Renee!

164
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:12,420
Sit down, Killer!

165
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,700
I didn't kill her.

166
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,660
Tell me I didn't kill her.

167
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:41,060
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

168
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:51,740
Fred Madison, the jury having found
you guilty of murder in the first degree,

169
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:55,510
it is my order that you be put to death in the electric chair.

170
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:12,590
Make yourself to home, fella.

171
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,070
Stick your hand out, chief.

172
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:32,390
Something wrong?

173
00:43:37,670 --> 00:43:39,190
It's...my head.

174
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:05,550
You sleeping OK?

175
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,150
No.

176
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,990
I can't sleep.

177
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:00,150
You'll sleep now.

178
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,910
Take him back to his cell.

179
00:45:05,510 --> 00:45:06,550
Let's go.

180
00:45:18,270 --> 00:45:18,910
Guard!

181
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:23,830
Guard!

182
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:36,750
Guard!

183
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:43,070
Hey!

184
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:47,710
What do you want?

185
00:45:49,390 --> 00:45:52,190
Aspirin.
My head.

186
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,470
Hey! Hey!

187
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:12,830
Shit. That wife killer's looking pretty fucked up.

188
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:14,990
Which one?

189
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,880
Pete!

190
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,240
Please don't go!

191
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,360
No. Pete!

192
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:05,640
Pete!..Pete!..Pete!
Wait a minute!

193
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,320
Fuck me!

194
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,120
All right. What's the situation?

195
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,280
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

196
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:03,680
Right here.

197
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,680
That's not Fred Madison.

198
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,560
No, Sir. It's not.

199
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,440
-Who is it?
-I couldn't say, Sir.

200
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,720
Captain Luneau?

201
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,480
Yeah, Mike?

202
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:28,160
Captain...

203
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,280
This is some spooky shit we got here.

204
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,480
Well, Gentlemen, we know who the stranger is.

205
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,960
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.

206
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:51,880
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft

207
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:55,160
for which he was put on probation for 1 year.

208
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:02,880
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.

209
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:53,440
So...

210
00:52:33,480 --> 00:52:35,680
-Here.
-Thanks, Lou.

211
00:54:23,050 --> 00:54:25,610
Where the fuck have you been, man?

212
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,770
-Hey! -Hiya. -Hi.
-Hey, guy.

213
00:54:28,970 --> 00:54:31,410
-Hey, man.
-What's up man?

214
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,570
Well, you look like shit.

215
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:36,210
Yeah. What happened?

216
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:39,770
Just haven't been feeling so good.

217
00:54:39,970 --> 00:54:41,850
You're not contagious, are you?

218
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,570
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.

219
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:45,650
All right. Well, let's go for a drive then.

220
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,490
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.

221
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:51,890
It takes many strawberries to fill a bucket.

222
00:54:52,090 --> 00:54:54,890
But it's worth it when you know that...

223
00:54:55,170 --> 00:54:56,490
-Come on.
-Hoh.

224
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,210
Come on. I'll lead.

225
00:54:58,530 --> 00:55:01,890
...and a glass of fresh, cold milk from grandmother's cow.

226
00:55:04,210 --> 00:55:05,010
See ya later.

227
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:09,450
-I'm gonna go out with these clowns for a while.
-That should do you some good.

228
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:15,050
-Good night. -See ya.
-Good night.

229
00:55:42,930 --> 00:55:44,570
What's happening to you?

230
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,050
What happened to your face?

231
00:55:49,730 --> 00:55:52,450
-I don't know?
-What do you mean, you don't know?

232
00:55:53,570 --> 00:55:55,850
You've been acting strange lately.

233
00:55:56,370 --> 00:55:57,690
Like the other night.

234
00:56:00,210 --> 00:56:01,330
What night?

235
00:56:01,970 --> 00:56:04,170
The last time I saw you.

236
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:06,450
I don't remember.

237
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:19,090
You still care about me?

238
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:45,250
Pete!

239
00:56:48,130 --> 00:56:49,930
-Arnie!
-Where you been?

240
00:56:50,170 --> 00:56:52,610
-How you doing?
-It's good you're back...

241
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:55,490
...Wonderful.
-Good to see you, man.

242
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,330
Listen, man, a lot of people...

243
00:56:56,570 --> 00:56:59,770
...gonna be real happy that you're back, including me.

244
00:57:00,010 --> 00:57:01,530
Well, it's good to be back.

245
00:57:01,730 --> 00:57:03,770
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.

246
00:57:03,970 --> 00:57:05,250
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

247
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:07,970
And Mr. Eddy called.

248
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:12,210
-Can I call him and tell him to come in?
-Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.

249
00:57:12,850 --> 00:57:15,690
-And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
-You're ready to work?
-Yeah.

250
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:18,170
-Well, let's go to work.
-All right, Buddy.

251
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:23,170
Petey's back!

252
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:41,890
There's 9 People down here.

253
00:57:42,810 --> 00:57:47,410
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...

254
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:50,410
...I'll let you ask the other 2.

255
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:00,930
Hey, Pete!

256
00:58:04,130 --> 00:58:05,090
Pete!

257
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:08,890
Where's Pete?

258
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:11,490
He's back there!

259
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:12,490
Mr. Eddy!

260
00:58:14,210 --> 00:58:15,250
Hey!

261
00:58:19,130 --> 00:58:20,530
What happened?

262
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:22,850
-Somebody giving you trouble?
-No. No trouble.

263
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:26,650
'Cause if somebody's giving you trouble, Pete,...

264
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:29,530
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that!

265
00:58:29,730 --> 00:58:33,930
-No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
-I mean it, Pete. Like...that!

266
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,450
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...

267
00:58:36,650 --> 00:58:40,330
...just a regular tune-up?
-I want you to take a ride with me.

268
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:43,050
I don't like the sound of something.

269
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,170
-OK. I got to check in with the boss.
-It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.

270
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:23,180
Pull it over, but keep it running.

271
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,100
Best goddamn ears in town.

272
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,980
Give that a try.

273
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:12,900
Beautiful...Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.

274
01:00:15,580 --> 01:00:18,620
-Let's take a ride.
-Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

275
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,860
It's a beautiful day.

276
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,780
-You did a great job, Pete.
-Yeah.

277
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:46,700
Well, you know I like working on this car, Mr. Eddy.

278
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:06,820
Shit. That cocksucker doing what I think he's doing?

279
01:01:37,020 --> 01:01:38,500
This is where mechanical excellence...

280
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,220
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.

281
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:18,060
Ahh...Oh, oh, God!

282
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:27,420
Don't you ever fucking tailgate!

283
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:29,700
-Ever!
-Tell him you won't tailgate.

284
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:30,700
Ever!

285
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:34,220
-I won't ever...
-Do you know how many fucking car lengths it takes...

286
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,500
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?!

287
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:41,060
6 fucking car lengths!
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister!

288
01:02:41,980 --> 01:02:44,500
If I had to stop suddenly, you would've hit me!

289
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,060
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual!
I want you to study that motherfucker!

290
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,500
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules!

291
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:55,460
50 fucking thousand people were
killed on the highway last

292
01:02:55,700 --> 01:02:58,460
Because of fucking assholes like you!

293
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:04,820
-Tell me you're going to get a manual!
-I will ge-get a manual.

294
01:03:07,420 --> 01:03:09,060
Fucking ldiot!

295
01:03:09,300 --> 01:03:12,260
Oh!.Aah!.Oh, Gooood!

296
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:51,780
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

297
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:56,260
But tailgating is one thing I cannot tolerate.

298
01:03:57,740 --> 01:03:59,540
Yeah, I can see that.

299
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:10,820
Wait a minute!

300
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:18,340
-Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
-No, thank you.

301
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:20,820
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

302
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,460
You like pornos?

303
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,020
-Pornos?
-Give you a boner?

304
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,820
Uh, No, No thanks. No.

305
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:32,860
Suit yourself, champ.

306
01:04:34,060 --> 01:04:37,900
-Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
-You will.

307
01:04:44,220 --> 01:04:45,670
Damn!

308
01:04:53,350 --> 01:04:56,310
Lou, you recognize that guy?

309
01:04:58,510 --> 01:05:00,870
Yeah...Laurent.

310
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:12,910
-What do you want?
-Want to go for a drive?

311
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:15,910
I don't know.

312
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,230
Get in, Baby!

313
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:41,270
Come here!

314
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:26,150
-Why don't you like me?
-I do like you.

315
01:07:26,950 --> 01:07:28,070
How much?

316
01:08:34,630 --> 01:08:35,950
Oh, Pete!

317
01:08:42,070 --> 01:08:42,790
Sheila!

318
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:46,750
Sheila!

319
01:09:27,710 --> 01:09:29,510
What'd you change it for?

320
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:31,630
I like that.

321
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:34,190
Well, I don't.

322
01:09:43,710 --> 01:09:45,110
I like that!

323
01:10:18,910 --> 01:10:21,670
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

324
01:10:21,910 --> 01:10:24,550
-Think you'll get a chance to give her the once-over today?
-Sure.

325
01:10:25,230 --> 01:10:28,030
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?

326
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:31,990
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

327
01:10:32,270 --> 01:10:35,790
-It'll be done.
-You're my man, Pete.

328
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,520
Don't let that thing upset you.

329
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,880
Holy smokes!

330
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:17,560
Hey!

331
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,360
I'm Alice Wakefield.

332
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:23,520
Pete Dayton.

333
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:28,720
-I was here earlier.
-Yeah, I remember.

334
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,800
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

335
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:41,400
I don't know.

336
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:48,240
OK.

337
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:51,840
Why don't I take you to dinner?

338
01:13:54,480 --> 01:13:58,400
Look, I don't think this is a very good idea.

339
01:14:05,720 --> 01:14:07,160
Do you have a phone?

340
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:11,160
Yeah.

341
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:14,200
It's right...lt's right there.

342
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,680
I have to call myself another taxi.

343
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:29,720
Hello? Van Nuys?

344
01:14:30,160 --> 01:14:33,840
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

345
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:50,840
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...

346
01:14:51,680 --> 01:14:55,040
Hello. Yeah, we're not going to need that cab.
Thanks.

347
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:13,960
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

348
01:15:46,160 --> 01:15:47,560
Take my clothes off!

349
01:15:51,640 --> 01:15:54,480
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

350
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,280
-I want more.
-Me, too.

351
01:16:51,010 --> 01:16:56,610
-Can I call you?
-Yeah. Call me at home. I'll give you the number.

352
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:03,760
OK, Baby.

353
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:36,130
Hey! Up here.Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.

354
01:18:09,490 --> 01:18:12,170
I'll get it.
Hello?

355
01:18:13,050 --> 01:18:16,090
Meow, meow.It's me.

356
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:17,770
Hey, Baby.

357
01:18:19,250 --> 01:18:21,850
I can't see you tonight.

358
01:18:25,170 --> 01:18:26,290
OK.

359
01:18:27,930 --> 01:18:30,130
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.

360
01:18:31,290 --> 01:18:32,610
Sure.

361
01:18:34,610 --> 01:18:39,530
I think he suspects something. We have to be careful.

362
01:18:42,490 --> 01:18:44,050
I miss you.

363
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:48,690
Pete?

364
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,450
Me, too.

365
01:18:53,250 --> 01:18:55,210
I'll call you again.

366
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,290
What a fucking job.

367
01:20:32,090 --> 01:20:33,730
His or ours, Lou?

368
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:36,730
Ours, Hank.

369
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,690
-Hey.
-Sit down a minute!

370
01:21:04,610 --> 01:21:07,170
-What's up?
-Sit down!

371
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:11,370
You don't look so good.

372
01:21:11,970 --> 01:21:15,090
No, I just...just have a headache.

373
01:21:16,490 --> 01:21:18,010
What's going on?

374
01:21:19,570 --> 01:21:21,370
The police called us.

375
01:21:23,530 --> 01:21:24,410
What'd they want?

376
01:21:24,650 --> 01:21:30,010
They want to know if we had a chance
to find out what happened to you the other night.

377
01:21:30,770 --> 01:21:33,730
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

378
01:21:37,570 --> 01:21:39,850
But I don't remember anything.

379
01:21:41,450 --> 01:21:43,650
What'd you tell them?

380
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:51,170
We're not going to say anything...

381
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:53,890
...about that night to the police.

382
01:21:56,730 --> 01:21:59,010
We saw you that night, Pete.

383
01:22:02,330 --> 01:22:04,610
You came home with your friend Sheila.

384
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:07,490
Sheila?

385
01:22:10,770 --> 01:22:13,210
Yeah. There was a man with you.

386
01:22:14,210 --> 01:22:17,890
What is this? I mean, why didn't you tell me anything?

387
01:22:22,970 --> 01:22:24,410
Who's the man?

388
01:22:25,970 --> 01:22:29,170
I've never seen him before in my life.

389
01:22:34,410 --> 01:22:36,050
What happened to me?

390
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:42,050
Please, please, Dad, Tell me!

391
01:23:00,130 --> 01:23:01,250
Hey, Pete! Hey!

392
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:03,660
Hey!

393
01:23:14,900 --> 01:23:15,620
Hey!

394
01:23:16,780 --> 01:23:17,580
Mr. Eddy.

395
01:23:27,940 --> 01:23:29,980
Hey, Pete!

396
01:23:30,860 --> 01:23:32,820
-How you doing?
-I'm OK.

397
01:23:33,020 --> 01:23:35,900
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

398
01:23:36,140 --> 01:23:39,180
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.

399
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:44,700
Her name is Alice.I swear,
I love that girl to death.

400
01:23:47,220 --> 01:23:51,340
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

401
01:23:53,660 --> 01:23:55,460
I'd take this

402
01:23:55,700 --> 01:23:59,700
and I'd shove it so far up his ass,
it would come out his mouth.

403
01:23:59,900 --> 01:24:03,180
-And then you know what I'd do?
-What?

404
01:24:04,020 --> 01:24:06,740
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

405
01:24:13,580 --> 01:24:17,460
Hey. You're looking good.

406
01:24:18,460 --> 01:24:20,260
What you been up to?

407
01:24:29,700 --> 01:24:30,740
I'll get it.

408
01:24:32,820 --> 01:24:33,460
Hello?

409
01:24:35,620 --> 01:24:41,860
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

410
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,300
He'll kill us.

411
01:24:52,060 --> 01:24:53,420
Are you...

412
01:24:55,820 --> 01:24:57,540
...positive that he knows?

413
01:24:57,740 --> 01:25:00,620
I'm not positive, but he knows.

414
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:08,700
So...What are we supposed to do?

415
01:25:11,620 --> 01:25:13,100
I don't know.

416
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:48,020
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

417
01:25:52,420 --> 01:25:54,060
I know a guy.

418
01:25:56,500 --> 01:25:59,620
He pays girls to party with him.

419
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:02,020
He's always got a lot of cash.

420
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:05,340
He'd be easy to rob.

421
01:26:06,820 --> 01:26:11,260
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.

422
01:26:13,180 --> 01:26:15,380
We could be together.

423
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:25,300
Have you partied with him?

424
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:32,940
Did you like it?

425
01:26:34,980 --> 01:26:36,020
No.

426
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:38,340
It was part of the deal.

427
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,620
What deal?

428
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:47,180
-He works for Mr. Eddy.
-Yeah?

429
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:50,980
-And what's he do?
-He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

430
01:26:51,780 --> 01:26:54,980
-Pornos?
-Yeah.

431
01:26:56,060 --> 01:26:58,500
How did you get in with these
fucking people, Alice?

432
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:02,380
-Pete...
-No. Pete. I want to know how it happened.

433
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:08,980
It was a long time ago.

434
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:14,700
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

435
01:27:16,300 --> 01:27:18,260
He told me about a job.

436
01:27:23,420 --> 01:27:24,700
In pornos?

437
01:27:27,780 --> 01:27:32,780
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.

438
01:27:35,700 --> 01:27:39,220
He made an appointment for me to see a man.

439
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:41,780
I went to this place.

440
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:46,140
They made me wait there forever.

441
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:50,820
There was a guy guarding the door.

442
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,900
In another room, there was this
other guy lifting weights.

443
01:28:04,820 --> 01:28:06,620
I started getting nervous.

444
01:28:08,940 --> 01:28:11,300
When it got dark...

445
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,540
...they brought me into this other room.

446
01:30:33,750 --> 01:30:36,110
Why didn't you just leave?

447
01:30:44,030 --> 01:30:46,150
You liked it, huh?

448
01:30:49,630 --> 01:30:54,870
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.

449
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:02,310
I don't want you to go away.

450
01:31:03,110 --> 01:31:04,510
I don't want you to go away.

451
01:31:14,830 --> 01:31:16,710
I love you, Alice.

452
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:23,190
-Should I call Andy?
-Andy?

453
01:31:25,030 --> 01:31:27,910
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

454
01:31:28,870 --> 01:31:31,510
Yeah. Call him.

455
01:31:34,270 --> 01:31:36,390
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

456
01:31:37,030 --> 01:31:39,310
You meet me at his place at 11:00.

457
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:44,310
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.

458
01:31:44,990 --> 01:31:50,910
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.

459
01:31:51,110 --> 01:31:53,990
It's a white Stucco job
on the south side of the street.

460
01:31:54,230 --> 01:31:58,830
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.

461
01:31:59,190 --> 01:32:02,790
Go through the kitchen into the living room.
There's a bar there.

462
01:32:03,110 --> 01:32:07,230
At 11:15, I'll send Andy down to fix me a drink.

463
01:32:07,430 --> 01:32:11,030
And when he does,
you crack him on the head, OK?

464
01:32:14,870 --> 01:32:15,510
OK.

465
01:32:44,430 --> 01:32:47,030
-You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
-Sheila!

466
01:32:47,230 --> 01:32:49,510
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila! Sheila, stop it!

467
01:32:49,710 --> 01:32:51,830
-You don't call. Who is she?
-Stop it!

468
01:32:52,030 --> 01:32:54,870
-What's the bitch's name?
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?

469
01:32:55,070 --> 01:32:56,630
-Go home!
-You're sorry?
-Sheila, stop it!

470
01:32:56,870 --> 01:32:58,830
You're sorry, you piece of shit!

471
01:32:59,030 --> 01:33:00,430
-You're sorry?
-Go home!

472
01:33:00,630 --> 01:33:02,670
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila, stop, Sheila!
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!

473
01:33:02,950 --> 01:33:05,390
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila...Sheila.

474
01:33:05,710 --> 01:33:09,750
Sheila! Let's both go in and talk about this quietly.

475
01:33:10,150 --> 01:33:11,670
Sheila, come on.

476
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:16,230
-You are different.
-Sheila!

477
01:33:16,550 --> 01:33:18,750
Tell him!..Tell him!

478
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:21,670
Sheila, don't. Don't.

479
01:33:23,070 --> 01:33:29,750
I don't care anymore anyway. I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

480
01:33:30,310 --> 01:33:36,150
I won't bother you, or any member
of your family ever again.

481
01:33:50,230 --> 01:33:51,270
Pete?

482
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:55,750
There's a man on the phone.

483
01:33:56,990 --> 01:33:59,430
He's called a couple of times tonight.

484
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:01,150
Who is it?

485
01:34:03,190 --> 01:34:04,750
He won't give his name.

486
01:34:23,190 --> 01:34:24,310
Hello?

487
01:34:25,030 --> 01:34:27,470
Hey, Pete, how you doing?

488
01:34:29,710 --> 01:34:33,830
-Who is this?
-You know who it is.

489
01:34:37,190 --> 01:34:38,510
Mr. Eddy?

490
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:42,310
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

491
01:34:43,070 --> 01:34:46,830
-OK.
-You're doing OK? That's good, Pete.

492
01:34:48,750 --> 01:34:54,830
-Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
-I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.

493
01:34:56,950 --> 01:35:02,710
-You're sure you're OK? Everything all right?
-Yeah.

494
01:35:04,670 --> 01:35:07,950
I'm really glad to know you're doing good, Pete. Hey!

495
01:35:09,030 --> 01:35:10,920
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.

496
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,800
We've met before, haven't we?

497
01:35:20,200 --> 01:35:21,560
I don't think so.

498
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:25,640
Where is it you think we've met?

499
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:29,720
At your house. Don't you remember?

500
01:35:33,320 --> 01:35:37,080
No. No, I don't.

501
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:41,160
In the East, the far East...

502
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:46,680
...when a person is sentenced to death,
they're sent to a place where they can't escape.

503
01:35:47,280 --> 01:35:54,120
Never knowing when an executioner may step up behind them
and fire a bullet into the back of their head.

504
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:57,120
What's going on?

505
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:00,280
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

506
01:36:01,200 --> 01:36:06,440
Pete, I just wanted to jump on and
tell you that I'm really glad you're doing OK.

507
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:15,320
You got him.

508
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,600
Alice!

509
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:13,360
Wow!

510
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,640
We killed him.

511
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,400
You killed him.

512
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:33,040
Alice?

513
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:39,800
Alice?

514
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:42,680
What do we do?

515
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,680
What do we do?

516
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,560
We have to get the stuff.

517
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,520
We have to get out of here.

518
01:41:07,600 --> 01:41:08,720
Ah, fuck!

519
01:41:43,690 --> 01:41:44,650
Is that you?

520
01:41:46,290 --> 01:41:47,730
Are both of them you?

521
01:41:57,010 --> 01:41:58,290
That's me.

522
01:42:00,930 --> 01:42:03,290
Honey, are you all right?

523
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:09,650
Where's the bathroom?

524
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:13,810
It's upstairs, down the hall.

525
01:43:09,010 --> 01:43:10,730
Did you want to talk to me?

526
01:43:13,570 --> 01:43:16,450
Did you want to ask me, why?

527
01:44:12,010 --> 01:44:13,130
What's the matter?

528
01:44:16,730 --> 01:44:18,170
Don't you trust me, Pete?

529
01:44:26,690 --> 01:44:28,730
Stick this in your pants.

530
01:44:35,770 --> 01:44:37,970
I know a fence.

531
01:44:40,530 --> 01:44:45,130
He'll give us money, get us passports
in exchange for all this shit

532
01:44:46,010 --> 01:44:47,210
and Andy's car...

533
01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:51,250
And then we can go anywhere.

534
01:45:06,010 --> 01:45:07,290
Come on, Baby!

535
01:45:23,130 --> 01:45:24,330
Pete, you drive!

536
01:45:39,530 --> 01:45:41,970
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

537
01:45:44,490 --> 01:45:46,450
Where the fuck are we going?

538
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:51,290
We have to go to the desert, Baby.

539
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:56,090
The fence I told you about...

540
01:45:59,930 --> 01:46:01,410
He's at his cabin.

541
01:47:12,700 --> 01:47:13,660
Come on!

542
01:47:59,700 --> 01:48:01,500
We'll have to wait.

543
01:48:21,660 --> 01:48:24,260
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?

544
01:48:31,740 --> 01:48:33,860
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

545
01:48:37,540 --> 01:48:39,580
More than ever.

546
01:50:35,940 --> 01:50:37,060
I want you.

547
01:50:45,820 --> 01:50:47,100
I want you.

548
01:51:04,900 --> 01:51:06,020
I want you.

549
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:09,060
I want you.

550
01:51:27,620 --> 01:51:31,620
You'll never have me.

551
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:34,740
Here I am.

552
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:30,430
-Where's Alice?
-Alice who? Her name is Renee.

553
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:34,270
If she told you her name is Alice, she's lying.

554
01:53:38,230 --> 01:53:42,310
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?!

555
01:56:56,830 --> 01:56:57,470
Renee?

556
01:57:07,470 --> 01:57:09,470
You're coming with me.

557
01:59:07,270 --> 01:59:09,870
What do you guys want?

558
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:23,760
Now you can hand it back!

559
02:00:33,160 --> 02:00:35,280
You and me, Mister...

560
02:00:38,320 --> 02:00:42,200
We can really outugly them sumbitches...

561
02:00:43,120 --> 02:00:44,760
Can't we?

562
02:01:38,480 --> 02:01:40,840
Ed...Take a look at this!

563
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:49,400
Yeah. That's her all right.

564
02:01:50,760 --> 02:01:54,120
That's Fred Madison's wife with Dick Laurent.

565
02:01:54,520 --> 02:01:56,400
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.

566
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:00,400
We got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.

567
02:02:01,320 --> 02:02:03,040
You know what I think, Ed?

568
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:06,680
What is it, AI? What do you think?

569
02:02:08,040 --> 02:02:10,680
I think there's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

570
02:03:11,600 --> 02:03:13,080
Dick Laurent is dead.
