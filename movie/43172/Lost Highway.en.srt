2
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,300
Dick Laurent is dead.

3
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,200
You don't mind that
I'm not coming tonight?

4
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,800
What are you going to do?

5
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,000
Stay home, read.

6
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,300
Read?

7
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
Read?

8
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,800
Read what, Renee?

9
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
It's nice to know 
I can still make you laugh.

10
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,600
I like to laugh, Fred.

11
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,800
That's why I married you.

12
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,400
You can wake me up when
you get home if you want to.

13
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:07,900
What is that?

14
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,100
A videotape.

15
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,300
I found it outside on the steps.

16
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,500
Who's it from?

17
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,900
I don't know.

18
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:33,000
There isn't anything on the envelope.

19
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,800
Does it say anything on the tape?

20
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,700
No. Nothing.

21
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,100
Well, see what's on it.

22
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,900
Come on.

23
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:48,600
Must be from a real estate agent.

24
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,800
Maybe.

25
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,900
It's OK.

26
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,600
It's OK.

27
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,200
It's OK.

28
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,100
I had a dream last night.

29
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,900
You were inside the house...

30
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,900
You were calling my name...

31
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,200
Fred!

32
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,300
Fred!

33
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,800
Where are you.

34
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,700
I couldn't find you.

35
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,900
Then there you were...

36
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,600
... Iying in bed.

37
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,500
It wasn't you.

38
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:19,900
It looked like you, but it wasn't.

39
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,800
Fred, are you all right?

40
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You're up early.

41
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,900
That dog woke me.

42
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,000
Who the hell owns that dog?

43
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,400
What's that?

44
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,100
Another videotape.

45
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,000
Yes.

46
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,700
Don't you want to watch it?

47
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,500
I guess so.

48
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,600
Well, don't you want to watch it?

49
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
Yeah.

50
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,600
It's the same thing.

51
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,500
No, it isn't.

52
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,600
Fred?

53
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,000
What?

54
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,800
We have to call the police.

55
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,900
That's right. Yes.

56
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,900
Someone broke in and taped us
while we slept. Isn't that enough?

57
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,400
7035 Hollis.

58
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,300
Near the observatory.

59
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:27,700
Yes.

60
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,100
We'll be here.

61
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,900
So?

62
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,300
They're sending 2 detectives out.

63
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,300
That's it.

64
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,600
What do you think.

65
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,200
I really don't know.

66
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,800
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.

67
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,700
This is the bedroom?

68
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,000
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.

69
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,200
This is our bedroom.

70
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,000
There's no other bedroom?

71
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,000
No.

72
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:01,400
I mean, I use it as a practice room.

73
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,700
It's soundproof.

74
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,300
You're a musician?

75
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,400
Yeah.

76
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
What's your axe?

77
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,200
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.

78
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,400
- Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.

79
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,400
Do you own a video camera?

80
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,200
No.

81
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,900
Fred hates them.

82
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,700
I like to remember things my own way.

83
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,300
What do you mean by that?

84
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,400
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.

85
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,300
You have an alarm system?

86
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes. Actually, we do.

87
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,300
But we haven't been using it lately.

88
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,400
Why not?

89
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,400
It kept going off...

90
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,000
For some reason. False alarms.

91
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,600
Might want to try and use it again.

92
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,500
Yeah.

93
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
OK?

94
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:23,200
We're going to check the windows and doors,
see if anybody tried to break in.

95
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,800
-We'll keep watch over the house.
-We'll do the best we can.

96
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:42,900
-If anything else happens, you'll call us.
-We will.

97
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,900
-Thanks, guys.
-It's what we do.

98
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:25,200
Hey, Andy! Welcome to my party.

99
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,300
-You look ravishing.
-Thank you.

100
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,100
Fred!

101
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,200
Please!

102
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,300
Please!

103
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,500
Hey!

104
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,300
-2 double scotches, neat.
-OK.

105
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,300
We've met before, haven't we?

106
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,200
I don't think so.

107
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,400
Where was it you think we met?

108
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,100
At your house. Don't you remember?

109
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,200
No. No, I don't.

110
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,900
Are you sure?

111
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,200
Of course.

112
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,700
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.

113
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,800
What do you mean? You're where right now?

114
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,000
At your house.

115
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,800
That's fucking crazy, man!

116
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,800
Call me!

117
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,400
Dial your number!

118
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,500
Go ahead!

119
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,000
I told you I was here.

120
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,800
How'd you do that?

121
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,900
Ask me!

122
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
How'd you get inside my house?

123
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,200
You invited me. It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.

124
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
Who are you?

125
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,400
Hm.

126
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,000
Give me back my phone.

127
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,700
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

128
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,000
-I thought you were getting me a drink.
-Hang on just a minute.

129
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,500
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?

130
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,000
I don't know his name. He's
a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

131
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,300
Dick Laurent?

132
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,400
Yeah. I believe so.

133
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,500
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

134
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,300
He is?

135
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,500
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

136
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,200
I don't.

137
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,900
I don't know him.

138
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,500
Dick can't be dead.

139
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,200
Who told you he was dead?

140
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,100
Who, honey?
Who's dead?

141
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,200
Let's go home.

142
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,600
-But...
-Now. We're leaving now.

143
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,600
We never should have come here in the first place.

144
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,700
So, how'd you meet that asshole Andy anyway?

145
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,300
It was a long time ago.

146
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,000
We met at a place called Moke's.

147
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:05,400
We became friends.

148
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,000
He told me about a job.

149
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,100
What job?

150
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,800
I don't remember.

151
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,700
Anyway...Andy's OK.

152
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,600
Well, He's got some pretty fucked-up friends.

153
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
Hey!..
Hey!..

154
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,500
Stay in the car.

155
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,600
I told you to stay in the car.

156
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,000
Why? What is it?

157
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,400
Why did you make me stay out here?

158
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,400
I'll tell you why, because I thought someone was inside the house.

159
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,600
Was there?

160
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,300
No, of course not.

161
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,200
Fred?

162
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:18,200
Fred, where are you?

163
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,000
Renee!

164
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,000
Renee!

165
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,600
Sit down, Killer!

166
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,900
I didn't kill her.

167
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,900
Tell me I didn't kill her.

168
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:41,300
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

169
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:52,000
Fred Madison, the jury having found
you guilty of murder in the first degree,

170
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:55,700
it is my order that you be put to death in the electric chair.

171
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:12,800
Make yourself to home, fella.

172
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,300
Stick your hand out, chief.

173
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:32,600
Something wrong?

174
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:39,400
It's...my head.

175
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:05,800
You sleeping OK?

176
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,400
No.

177
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,200
I can't sleep.

178
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,400
You'll sleep now.

179
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,100
Take him back to his cell.

180
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,800
Let's go.

181
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:19,100
Guard!

182
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,000
Guard!

183
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:37,000
Guard!

184
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,300
Hey!

185
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,900
What do you want?

186
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:52,400
Aspirin.
My head.

187
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,700
Hey! Hey!

188
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:13,000
Shit. That wife killer's looking pretty fucked up.

189
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:15,200
Which one?

190
00:47:57,900 --> 00:47:59,100
Pete!

191
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,400
Please don't go!

192
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:03,600
No. Pete!

193
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:05,800
Pete!..Pete!..Pete!
Wait a minute!

194
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,500
Fuck me!

195
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,300
All right. What's the situation?

196
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,500
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

197
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,900
Right here.

198
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,900
That's not Fred Madison.

199
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:14,800
No, Sir. It's not.

200
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:21,600
-Who is it?
-I couldn't say, Sir.

201
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:24,900
Captain Luneau?

202
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:26,700
Yeah, Mike?

203
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,400
Captain...

204
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:31,500
This is some spooky shit we got here.

205
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,700
Well, Gentlemen, we know who the stranger is.

206
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,200
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.

207
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:52,100
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft

208
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,400
for which he was put on probation for 1 year.

209
00:50:56,400 --> 00:51:03,100
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.

210
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:53,600
So...

211
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,900
-Here.
-Thanks, Lou.

212
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,800
Where the fuck have you been, man?

213
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,000
-Hey! -Hiya. -Hi.
-Hey, guy.

214
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,600
-Hey, man.
-What's up man?

215
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:34,800
Well, you look like shit.

216
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,400
Yeah. What happened?

217
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,000
Just haven't been feeling so good.

218
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,000
You're not contagious, are you?

219
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,800
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.

220
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:45,800
All right. Well, let's go for a drive then.

221
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,700
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.

222
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:52,100
It takes many strawberries to fill a bucket.

223
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,100
But it's worth it when you know that...

224
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,700
-Come on.
-Hoh.

225
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:58,400
Come on. I'll lead.

226
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:02,100
...and a glass of fresh, cold milk from grandmother's cow.

227
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:05,200
See ya later.

228
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:09,600
-I'm gonna go out with these clowns for a while.
-That should do you some good.

229
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:15,200
-Good night. -See ya.
-Good night.

230
00:55:43,100 --> 00:55:44,800
What's happening to you?

231
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,200
What happened to your face?

232
00:55:49,900 --> 00:55:52,600
-I don't know?
-What do you mean, you don't know?

233
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:56,000
You've been acting strange lately.

234
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,900
Like the other night.

235
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,500
What night?

236
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,400
The last time I saw you.

237
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,600
I don't remember.

238
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:19,300
You still care about me?

239
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:45,400
Pete!

240
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,100
-Arnie!
-Where you been?

241
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,800
-How you doing?
-It's good you're back...

242
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,700
...Wonderful.
-Good to see you, man.

243
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:56,500
Listen, man, a lot of people...

244
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,000
...gonna be real happy that you're back, including me.

245
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,700
Well, it's good to be back.

246
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:04,000
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.

247
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:05,400
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

248
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,200
And Mr. Eddy called.

249
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:12,400
-Can I call him and tell him to come in?
-Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.

250
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,900
-And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
-You're ready to work?
-Yeah.

251
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,400
-Well, let's go to work.
-All right, Buddy.

252
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:23,400
Petey's back!

253
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:42,100
There's 9 People down here.

254
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,600
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...

255
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:50,600
...I'll let you ask the other 2.

256
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,100
Hey, Pete!

257
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,300
Pete!

258
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:09,100
Where's Pete?

259
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,700
He's back there!

260
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:12,700
Mr. Eddy!

261
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:15,400
Hey!

262
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:20,700
What happened?

263
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,000
-Somebody giving you trouble?
-No. No trouble.

264
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,800
'Cause if somebody's giving you trouble, Pete,...

265
00:58:27,100 --> 00:58:29,700
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that!

266
00:58:29,900 --> 00:58:34,100
-No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
-I mean it, Pete. Like...that!

267
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,600
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...

268
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:40,500
...just a regular tune-up?
-I want you to take a ride with me.

269
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:43,200
I don't like the sound of something.

270
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:47,400
-OK. I got to check in with the boss.
-It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.

271
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:23,400
Pull it over, but keep it running.

272
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,300
Best goddamn ears in town.

273
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:02,200
Give that a try.

274
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:13,100
Beautiful...Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.

275
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,800
-Let's take a ride.
-Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

276
01:00:32,100 --> 01:00:34,000
It's a beautiful day.

277
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,000
-You did a great job, Pete.
-Yeah.

278
01:00:44,300 --> 01:00:46,900
Well, you know I like working on this car, Mr. Eddy.

279
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:07,000
Shit. That cocksucker doing what I think he's doing?

280
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,700
This is where mechanical excellence...

281
01:01:38,900 --> 01:01:42,400
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.

282
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,200
Ahh...Oh, oh, God!

283
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:27,600
Don't you ever fucking tailgate!

284
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:29,900
-Ever!
-Tell him you won't tailgate.

285
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:30,900
Ever!

286
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,400
-I won't ever...
-Do you know how many fucking car lengths it takes...

287
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,700
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?!

288
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,200
6 fucking car lengths!
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister!

289
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,700
If I had to stop suddenly, you would've hit me!

290
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:49,200
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual!
I want you to study that motherfucker!

291
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,700
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules!

292
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:55,600
50 fucking thousand people were
killed on the highway last

293
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,600
Because of fucking assholes like you!

294
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:05,000
-Tell me you're going to get a manual!
-I will ge-get a manual.

295
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:09,200
Fucking ldiot!

296
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,400
Oh!.Aah!.Oh, Gooood!

297
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,000
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

298
01:03:52,800 --> 01:03:56,400
But tailgating is one thing I cannot tolerate.

299
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,700
Yeah, I can see that.

300
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,000
Wait a minute!

301
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:18,500
-Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
-No, thank you.

302
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,000
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

303
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:24,600
You like pornos?

304
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,200
-Pornos?
-Give you a boner?

305
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:31,000
Uh, No, No thanks. No.

306
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:33,000
Suit yourself, champ.

307
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:38,100
-Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
-You will.

308
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:45,800
Damn!

309
01:04:53,500 --> 01:04:56,500
Lou, you recognize that guy?

310
01:04:58,700 --> 01:05:01,000
Yeah...Laurent.

311
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,100
-What do you want?
-Want to go for a drive?

312
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:16,100
I don't know.

313
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,400
Get in, Baby!

314
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:41,400
Come here!

315
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,300
-Why don't you like me?
-I do like you.

316
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,200
How much?

317
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:36,100
Oh, Pete!

318
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:43,000
Sheila!

319
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:46,900
Sheila!

320
01:09:27,900 --> 01:09:29,700
What'd you change it for?

321
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:31,800
I like that.

322
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,400
Well, I don't.

323
01:09:43,900 --> 01:09:45,300
I like that!

324
01:10:19,100 --> 01:10:21,800
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

325
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:24,700
-Think you'll get a chance to give her the once-over today?
-Sure.

326
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:28,200
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?

327
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:32,200
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

328
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,000
-It'll be done.
-You're my man, Pete.

329
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,700
Don't let that thing upset you.

330
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:51,000
Holy smokes!

331
01:13:16,700 --> 01:13:17,700
Hey!

332
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,500
I'm Alice Wakefield.

333
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,700
Pete Dayton.

334
01:13:25,800 --> 01:13:28,900
-I was here earlier.
-Yeah, I remember.

335
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:38,000
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

336
01:13:39,800 --> 01:13:41,600
I don't know.

337
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:48,400
OK.

338
01:13:49,900 --> 01:13:52,000
Why don't I take you to dinner?

339
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,600
Look, I don't think this is a very good idea.

340
01:14:05,900 --> 01:14:07,300
Do you have a phone?

341
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:11,300
Yeah.

342
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,400
It's right...lt's right there.

343
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,800
I have to call myself another taxi.

344
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:29,900
Hello? Van Nuys?

345
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,000
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

346
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:51,000
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...

347
01:14:51,800 --> 01:14:55,200
Hello. Yeah, we're not going to need that cab.
Thanks.

348
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:14,100
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

349
01:15:46,300 --> 01:15:47,700
Take my clothes off!

350
01:15:51,800 --> 01:15:54,600
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

351
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,400
-I want more.
-Me, too.

352
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:56,800
-Can I call you?
-Yeah. Call me at home. I'll give you the number.

353
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:03,900
OK, Baby.

354
01:17:31,300 --> 01:17:36,300
Hey! Up here.Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.

355
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,300
I'll get it.
Hello?

356
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:16,200
Meow, meow.It's me.

357
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:17,900
Hey, Baby.

358
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,000
I can't see you tonight.

359
01:18:25,300 --> 01:18:26,400
OK.

360
01:18:28,100 --> 01:18:30,300
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.

361
01:18:31,400 --> 01:18:32,800
Sure.

362
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:39,700
I think he suspects something. We have to be careful.

363
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:44,200
I miss you.

364
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:48,800
Pete?

365
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:51,600
Me, too.

366
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,400
I'll call you again.

367
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:31,400
What a fucking job.

368
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:33,900
His or ours, Lou?

369
01:20:35,800 --> 01:20:36,900
Ours, Hank.

370
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:03,800
-Hey.
-Sit down a minute!

371
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,300
-What's up?
-Sit down!

372
01:21:09,900 --> 01:21:11,500
You don't look so good.

373
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:15,200
No, I just...just have a headache.

374
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,200
What's going on?

375
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,500
The police called us.

376
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:24,600
What'd they want?

377
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:30,200
They want to know if we had a chance
to find out what happened to you the other night.

378
01:21:30,900 --> 01:21:33,900
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

379
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:40,000
But I don't remember anything.

380
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:43,800
What'd you tell them?

381
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:51,300
We're not going to say anything...

382
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,000
...about that night to the police.

383
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:59,200
We saw you that night, Pete.

384
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,800
You came home with your friend Sheila.

385
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:07,600
Sheila?

386
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:13,400
Yeah. There was a man with you.

387
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:18,000
What is this? I mean, why didn't you tell me anything?

388
01:22:23,100 --> 01:22:24,600
Who's the man?

389
01:22:26,100 --> 01:22:29,300
I've never seen him before in my life.

390
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,200
What happened to me?

391
01:22:39,100 --> 01:22:42,200
Please, please, Dad, Tell me!

392
01:23:00,300 --> 01:23:01,400
Hey, Pete! Hey!

393
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,800
Hey!

394
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:15,800
Hey!

395
01:23:16,900 --> 01:23:17,700
Mr. Eddy.

396
01:23:28,100 --> 01:23:30,100
Hey, Pete!

397
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:33,000
-How you doing?
-I'm OK.

398
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:36,000
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

399
01:23:36,300 --> 01:23:39,300
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.

400
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:44,800
Her name is Alice.I swear,
I love that girl to death.

401
01:23:47,400 --> 01:23:51,500
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

402
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,600
I'd take this

403
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:59,800
and I'd shove it so far up his ass,
it would come out his mouth.

404
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:03,300
-And then you know what I'd do?
-What?

405
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,900
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

406
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:17,600
Hey. You're looking good.

407
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:20,400
What you been up to?

408
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:30,900
I'll get it.

409
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:33,600
Hello?

410
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:42,000
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

411
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:48,400
He'll kill us.

412
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:53,600
Are you...

413
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,700
...positive that he knows?

414
01:24:57,900 --> 01:25:00,800
I'm not positive, but he knows.

415
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:08,800
So...What are we supposed to do?

416
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,200
I don't know.

417
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:48,200
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

418
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:54,200
I know a guy.

419
01:25:56,600 --> 01:25:59,800
He pays girls to party with him.

420
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,200
He's always got a lot of cash.

421
01:26:03,700 --> 01:26:05,500
He'd be easy to rob.

422
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:11,400
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.

423
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,500
We could be together.

424
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:25,400
Have you partied with him?

425
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:33,100
Did you like it?

426
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:36,200
No.

427
01:26:37,100 --> 01:26:38,500
It was part of the deal.

428
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:40,800
What deal?

429
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,300
-He works for Mr. Eddy.
-Yeah?

430
01:26:48,100 --> 01:26:51,100
-And what's he do?
-He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

431
01:26:51,900 --> 01:26:55,100
-Pornos?
-Yeah.

432
01:26:56,200 --> 01:26:58,600
How did you get in with these
fucking people, Alice?

433
01:26:58,800 --> 01:27:02,500
-Pete...
-No. Pete. I want to know how it happened.

434
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:09,100
It was a long time ago.

435
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,800
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

436
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:18,400
He told me about a job.

437
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:24,800
In pornos?

438
01:27:27,900 --> 01:27:32,900
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.

439
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:39,400
He made an appointment for me to see a man.

440
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:41,900
I went to this place.

441
01:27:44,500 --> 01:27:46,300
They made me wait there forever.

442
01:27:48,700 --> 01:27:51,000
There was a guy guarding the door.

443
01:27:55,300 --> 01:27:58,000
In another room, there was this
other guy lifting weights.

444
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,800
I started getting nervous.

445
01:28:09,100 --> 01:28:11,400
When it got dark...

446
01:28:12,600 --> 01:28:15,700
...they brought me into this other room.

447
01:30:33,900 --> 01:30:36,200
Why didn't you just leave?

448
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:46,300
You liked it, huh?

449
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:55,000
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.

450
01:31:00,300 --> 01:31:02,400
I don't want you to go away.

451
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,600
I don't want you to go away.

452
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:16,800
I love you, Alice.

453
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,300
-Should I call Andy?
-Andy?

454
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:28,000
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

455
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:31,600
Yeah. Call him.

456
01:31:34,400 --> 01:31:36,500
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

457
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,400
You meet me at his place at 11:00.

458
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,400
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.

459
01:31:45,100 --> 01:31:51,000
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.

460
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:54,100
It's a white Stucco job
on the south side of the street.

461
01:31:54,400 --> 01:31:59,000
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.

462
01:31:59,300 --> 01:32:02,900
Go through the kitchen into the living room.
There's a bar there.

463
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:07,400
At 11:15, I'll send Andy down to fix me a drink.

464
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:11,200
And when he does,
you crack him on the head, OK?

465
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:15,600
OK.

466
01:32:44,600 --> 01:32:47,200
-You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
-Sheila!

467
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,600
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila! Sheila, stop it!

468
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,000
-You don't call. Who is she?
-Stop it!

469
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:55,000
-What's the bitch's name?
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?

470
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,800
-Go home!
-You're sorry?
-Sheila, stop it!

471
01:32:57,000 --> 01:32:59,000
You're sorry, you piece of shit!

472
01:32:59,200 --> 01:33:00,600
-You're sorry?
-Go home!

473
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,800
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila, stop, Sheila!
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!

474
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:05,500
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila...Sheila.

475
01:33:05,800 --> 01:33:09,900
Sheila! Let's both go in and talk about this quietly.

476
01:33:10,300 --> 01:33:11,800
Sheila, come on.

477
01:33:14,200 --> 01:33:16,400
-You are different.
-Sheila!

478
01:33:16,700 --> 01:33:18,900
Tell him!..Tell him!

479
01:33:19,100 --> 01:33:21,800
Sheila, don't. Don't.

480
01:33:23,200 --> 01:33:29,900
I don't care anymore anyway. I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

481
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:36,300
I won't bother you, or any member
of your family ever again.

482
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:51,400
Pete?

483
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:55,900
There's a man on the phone.

484
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:59,600
He's called a couple of times tonight.

485
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,300
Who is it?

486
01:34:03,300 --> 01:34:04,900
He won't give his name.

487
01:34:23,300 --> 01:34:24,400
Hello?

488
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,600
Hey, Pete, how you doing?

489
01:34:29,800 --> 01:34:34,000
-Who is this?
-You know who it is.

490
01:34:37,300 --> 01:34:38,600
Mr. Eddy?

491
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,400
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

492
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:47,000
-OK.
-You're doing OK? That's good, Pete.

493
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:55,000
-Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
-I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.

494
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:02,800
-You're sure you're OK? Everything all right?
-Yeah.

495
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:08,100
I'm really glad to know you're doing good, Pete. Hey!

496
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,000
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.

497
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:18,900
We've met before, haven't we?

498
01:35:20,300 --> 01:35:21,700
I don't think so.

499
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:25,800
Where is it you think we've met?

500
01:35:26,100 --> 01:35:29,800
At your house. Don't you remember?

501
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:37,200
No. No, I don't.

502
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:41,300
In the East, the far East...

503
01:35:41,500 --> 01:35:46,800
...when a person is sentenced to death,
they're sent to a place where they can't escape.

504
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:54,200
Never knowing when an executioner may step up behind them
and fire a bullet into the back of their head.

505
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,200
What's going on?

506
01:35:57,900 --> 01:36:00,400
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

507
01:36:01,300 --> 01:36:06,600
Pete, I just wanted to jump on and
tell you that I'm really glad you're doing OK.

508
01:39:14,300 --> 01:39:15,400
You got him.

509
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:17,700
Alice!

510
01:40:12,700 --> 01:40:13,500
Wow!

511
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:18,800
We killed him.

512
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:29,500
You killed him.

513
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,200
Alice?

514
01:40:38,700 --> 01:40:39,900
Alice?

515
01:40:41,300 --> 01:40:42,800
What do we do?

516
01:40:44,200 --> 01:40:45,800
What do we do?

517
01:40:47,000 --> 01:40:48,700
We have to get the stuff.

518
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:52,600
We have to get out of here.

519
01:41:07,700 --> 01:41:08,800
Ah, fuck!

520
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:44,800
Is that you?

521
01:41:46,400 --> 01:41:47,800
Are both of them you?

522
01:41:57,100 --> 01:41:58,400
That's me.

523
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,400
Honey, are you all right?

524
01:42:08,200 --> 01:42:09,800
Where's the bathroom?

525
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,900
It's upstairs, down the hall.

526
01:43:09,100 --> 01:43:10,800
Did you want to talk to me?

527
01:43:13,700 --> 01:43:16,600
Did you want to ask me, why?

528
01:44:12,100 --> 01:44:13,200
What's the matter?

529
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,300
Don't you trust me, Pete?

530
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:28,800
Stick this in your pants.

531
01:44:35,900 --> 01:44:38,100
I know a fence.

532
01:44:40,600 --> 01:44:45,200
He'll give us money, get us passports
in exchange for all this shit

533
01:44:46,100 --> 01:44:47,300
and Andy's car...

534
01:44:48,700 --> 01:44:51,400
And then we can go anywhere.

535
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:07,400
Come on, Baby!

536
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:24,400
Pete, you drive!

537
01:45:39,600 --> 01:45:42,100
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

538
01:45:44,600 --> 01:45:46,600
Where the fuck are we going?

539
01:45:49,300 --> 01:45:51,400
We have to go to the desert, Baby.

540
01:45:53,800 --> 01:45:56,200
The fence I told you about...

541
01:46:00,000 --> 01:46:01,500
He's at his cabin.

542
01:47:12,800 --> 01:47:13,800
Come on!

543
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,600
We'll have to wait.

544
01:48:21,800 --> 01:48:24,400
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?

545
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,000
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

546
01:48:37,600 --> 01:48:39,700
More than ever.

547
01:50:36,000 --> 01:50:37,200
I want you.

548
01:50:45,900 --> 01:50:47,200
I want you.

549
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,100
I want you.

550
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:09,200
I want you.

551
01:51:27,700 --> 01:51:31,700
You'll never have me.

552
01:52:33,900 --> 01:52:34,800
Here I am.

553
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:30,500
-Where's Alice?
-Alice who? Her name is Renee.

554
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:34,400
If she told you her name is Alice, she's lying.

555
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:42,400
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?!

556
01:56:56,900 --> 01:56:57,600
Renee?

557
01:57:07,600 --> 01:57:09,600
You're coming with me.

558
01:59:07,400 --> 01:59:10,000
What do you guys want?

559
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:23,800
Now you can hand it back!

560
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:35,400
You and me, Mister...

561
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:42,300
We can really outugly them sumbitches...

562
02:00:43,200 --> 02:00:44,800
Can't we?

563
02:01:38,600 --> 02:01:40,900
Ed...Take a look at this!

564
02:01:47,600 --> 02:01:49,500
Yeah. That's her all right.

565
02:01:50,800 --> 02:01:54,200
That's Fred Madison's wife with Dick Laurent.

566
02:01:54,600 --> 02:01:56,500
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.

567
02:01:58,000 --> 02:02:00,500
We got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.

568
02:02:01,400 --> 02:02:03,100
You know what I think, Ed?

569
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:06,800
What is it, AI? What do you think?

570
02:02:08,100 --> 02:02:10,800
I think there's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

571
02:03:11,700 --> 02:03:13,200
Dick Laurent is dead.

572
02:03:53,200 --> 02:04:03,200
