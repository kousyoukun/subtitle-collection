182
00:24:28,145 --> 00:24:30,101
It was a Iong time ago.

189
00:25:09,345 --> 00:25:11,540
There was a guy

190
00:25:16,345 --> 00:25:17,345
In another room there
was this other

guy Iifting weights.

192
00:25:26,145 --> 00:25:27,863
I started getting nervous.

193
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:31,298
When it got dark...

194
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:35,662

this other room.

195

00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:25,863

No.

275
00:32:56,345 --> 00:33:03,183
In the East, the far East,
when a person is

276
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:04,905
sentenced to death,

00:33:04,905 --> 00:33:07,863
they' re sent to a pIace
where they can ' t escape...

278
00:33:08,385 --> 00:33:10,745
never knowing when
an executioner may step up

279
00:33:10,745 --> 00:33:11,939
behind them...

280
00:33:12,185 --> 00:33:14,983
and fire a buIIet into
the back of their head.

281
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:17,944
What' s going on?

282
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:21,023
It' s been a pIeasure
taIking to you.

283
00:33:22,225 --> 00:33:24,500

A year it' s been since
he' s aIone

287
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:52,818
Grief deprived him of
aII his senses

288
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:59,621
SIeeps every night
near her stone"'

289
00:36:35,345 --> 00:36:35,982
You got him.

290
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:38,061
AIice.

291
00:37:38,225 --> 00:37:39,499
We kiIIed him.

292
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:48,860
You kiIIed him.

293
00:37:53,105 --> 00:37:54,299
AIice.

294
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:04,301
AIice? AIice?

295
00:38:04,705 --> 00:38:07,985
What do we do? what do we do?

296
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:09,498
We have to get the stuff.

297
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:13,019
We have to get outta here.

298
00:38:28,145 --> 00:38:29,180
An, fuck.

299
00:39:04,625 --> 00:39:07,458
Is that you?

300
00:39:17,745 --> 00:39:19,463
That' s...me.

301
00:39:21,905 --> 00:39:23,861
Honey, are you aII right?

302
00:39:29,105 --> 00:39:30,299
Where' s the bathroom?

303
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:34,260
It' s upstairs. Down the haII.

304
00:40:29,745 --> 00:40:31,861
Did you want to
taIk to me? Huh?

305
00:40:33,945 --> 00:40:36,539
Did you want to ask me,
"'Why"'?

306
00:41:33,065 --> 00:41:33,941
What' s the matter?

307
00:41:36,985 --> 00:41:38,543
Don ' t you trust me, pete?

308
00:41:47,825 --> 00:41:49,338
Stick this in your pants.

309
00:41:56,945 --> 00:41:58,139
I know a fence.

310
00:42:01,465 --> 00:42:04,423
He' II give us money

311
00:42:04,705 --> 00:42:05,820

00:42:06,265 --> 00:42:07,903
and Andy' s car.

313
00:42:09,465 --> 00:42:11,581
And then we can go anywhere.

314
00:42:26,705 --> 00:42:27,581
Come on, baby.

315
00:42:43,985 --> 00:42:44,861

316
00:43:00,945 --> 00:43:02,344
Where the fuck are

317
00:43:09,745 --> 00:43:11,701
We have to go the desert,
baby.

318
00:43:14,865 --> 00:43:16,503
That fence I toId you about?

319
00:43:20,665 --> 00:43:21,859

Come on.

321
00:45:20,185 --> 00:45:21,743
