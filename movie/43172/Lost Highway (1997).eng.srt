1
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,610
Dick Laurent is dead.

2
00:05:49,094 --> 00:05:51,934
You don't mind that
I'm not coming tonight?

3
00:05:55,137 --> 00:05:56,777
What are you going to do?

4
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:01,044
Stay home, read.

5
00:06:04,721 --> 00:06:05,601
Read?

6
00:06:16,765 --> 00:06:17,885
Read?

7
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:21,743
Read what, Renee?

8
00:06:28,809 --> 00:06:31,769
It's nice to know
I can still make you laugh.

9
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,054
I like to laugh, Fred.

10
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:43,641
That's why I married you.

11
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,440
You can wake me up when
you get home if you want to.

12
00:10:32,855 --> 00:10:33,975
What is that?

13
00:10:40,522 --> 00:10:42,482
A videotape.

14
00:10:45,442 --> 00:10:47,882
I found it outside on the steps.

15
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,337
Who's it from?

16
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:55,850
I don't know.

17
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,148
There isn't anything on the envelope.

18
00:11:03,944 --> 00:11:06,144
Does it say anything on the tape?

19
00:11:11,862 --> 00:11:13,382
No. Nothing.

20
00:11:16,738 --> 00:11:18,938
Well, see what's on it.

21
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:36,542
Come on.

22
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,893
Must be from a real estate agent.

23
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,284
Maybe.

24
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,801
It's OK.

25
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,598
It's OK.

26
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,353
It's OK.

27
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,334
I had a dream last night.

28
00:16:57,094 --> 00:16:58,454
You were inside the house...

29
00:17:08,012 --> 00:17:09,892
You were calling my name...

30
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:15,435
Fred!

31
00:17:21,055 --> 00:17:21,775
Fred!

32
00:17:24,265 --> 00:17:25,385
Where are you.

33
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:33,605
I couldn't find you.

34
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:53,667
Then there you were...

35
00:17:55,063 --> 00:17:56,503
... lying in bed.

36
00:17:57,814 --> 00:17:59,454
It wasn't you.

37
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:03,998
It looked like you, but it wasn't.

38
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:29,930
Fred, are you all right?

39
00:19:36,914 --> 00:19:38,954
You're up early.

40
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,008
That dog woke me.

41
00:19:53,084 --> 00:19:55,604
Who the hell owns that dog?

42
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:08,532
What's that?

43
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,548
Another videotape.

44
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:17,512
Yes.

45
00:20:31,008 --> 00:20:32,808
Don't you want to watch it?

46
00:20:34,633 --> 00:20:35,753
I guess so.

47
00:20:52,887 --> 00:20:54,607
Well, don't you want to watch it?

48
00:20:55,723 --> 00:20:56,683
Yeah.

49
00:21:08,765 --> 00:21:10,245
It's the same thing.

50
00:21:16,224 --> 00:21:17,424
No, it isn't.

51
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:26,908
Fred?

52
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:42,917
What?

53
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,337
We have to call the police.

54
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,520
That's right. Yes.

55
00:22:05,317 --> 00:22:10,837
Someone broke in and taped us
while we slept. Isn't that enough?

56
00:22:13,653 --> 00:22:15,693
7035 Hollis.

57
00:22:17,361 --> 00:22:19,721
Near the observatory.

58
00:22:21,613 --> 00:22:22,253
Yes.

59
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,760
We'll be here.

60
00:22:30,738 --> 00:22:31,858
So?

61
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:35,329
They're sending 2 detectives out.

62
00:22:51,994 --> 00:22:53,114
That's it.

63
00:22:54,243 --> 00:22:55,443
What do you think.

64
00:22:56,077 --> 00:22:58,197
I really don't know.

65
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:10,260
Let's check the hallway and the bedroom.

66
00:23:33,708 --> 00:23:35,188
This is the bedroom?

67
00:23:36,501 --> 00:23:39,621
You sleep here in this room.
Both of yous.

68
00:23:43,294 --> 00:23:45,094
This is our bedroom.

69
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,100
There's no other bedroom?

70
00:23:52,046 --> 00:23:53,246
No.

71
00:23:55,546 --> 00:23:59,746
I mean, I use it as a practice room.

72
00:24:00,882 --> 00:24:02,242
It's soundproof.

73
00:24:02,632 --> 00:24:03,912
You're a musician?

74
00:24:05,465 --> 00:24:06,185
Yeah.

75
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,360
What's your axe?

76
00:24:08,633 --> 00:24:11,073
Tenor. Tenor-Saxophone.

77
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,440
- Do you...
- No... Tone deaf.

78
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:18,611
Do you own a video camera?

79
00:24:18,883 --> 00:24:19,523
No.

80
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:23,321
Fred hates them.

81
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,432
I like to remember things my own way.

82
00:24:34,845 --> 00:24:36,205
What do you mean by that?

83
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:43,467
How I remembered them...
Not necessarily the way they happened.

84
00:24:48,015 --> 00:24:49,735
You have an alarm system?

85
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:52,576
Yes. Actually, we do.

86
00:24:53,307 --> 00:24:55,987
But we haven't been using it lately.

87
00:24:57,266 --> 00:24:58,226
Why not?

88
00:25:01,308 --> 00:25:03,428
It kept going off...

89
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:08,087
For some reason. False alarms.

90
00:25:10,018 --> 00:25:11,898
Might want to try and use it again.

91
00:25:12,852 --> 00:25:13,972
Yeah.

92
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,980
OK?

93
00:25:21,688 --> 00:25:24,968
We're going to check the windows and doors,
see if anybody tried to break in.

94
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:42,716
-We'll keep watch over the house.
-We'll do the best we can.

95
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:48,070
-If anything else happens, you'll call us.
-We will.

96
00:26:50,161 --> 00:26:53,281
-Thanks, guys.
-It's what we do.

97
00:27:28,377 --> 00:27:32,057
Hey, Andy! Welcome to my party.

98
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:35,410
-You look ravishing.
-Thank you.

99
00:27:50,257 --> 00:27:50,897
Fred!

100
00:27:53,008 --> 00:27:54,048
Please!

101
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:57,334
Please!

102
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:00,633
Hey!

103
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:20,191
-2 double scotches, neat.
-OK.

104
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:14,328
We've met before, haven't we?

105
00:29:17,981 --> 00:29:19,541
I don't think so.

106
00:29:22,273 --> 00:29:24,833
Where was it you think we met?

107
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,760
At your house. Don't you remember?

108
00:29:32,276 --> 00:29:34,076
No. No, I don't.

109
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:36,888
Are you sure?

110
00:29:37,778 --> 00:29:39,258
Of course.

111
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,940
As a matter of fact, I'm there right now.

112
00:29:49,946 --> 00:29:53,386
What do you mean? You're where right now?

113
00:29:55,197 --> 00:29:57,757
At your house.

114
00:30:01,574 --> 00:30:03,854
That's fucking crazy, man!

115
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,291
Call me!

116
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,220
Dial your number!

117
00:30:26,412 --> 00:30:27,532
Go ahead!

118
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:42,551
I told you I was here.

119
00:30:46,123 --> 00:30:47,643
How'd you do that?

120
00:30:51,292 --> 00:30:52,932
Ask me!

121
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:00,774
How'd you get inside my house?

122
00:31:01,042 --> 00:31:06,642
You invited me. It is not my custom
to go where I'm not wanted.

123
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:09,042
Who are you?

124
00:31:10,252 --> 00:31:11,212
Hm.

125
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:19,045
Give me back my phone.

126
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:33,350
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

127
00:31:51,342 --> 00:31:54,462
-I thought you were getting me a drink.
-Hang on just a minute.

128
00:31:55,553 --> 00:32:00,153
Andy, who's the guy on the stairs?
Guy in black?

129
00:32:01,721 --> 00:32:04,841
I don't know his name. He's
a friend of Dick Laurent, I think.

130
00:32:09,972 --> 00:32:11,532
Dick Laurent?

131
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:14,718
Yeah. I believe so.

132
00:32:21,099 --> 00:32:23,139
But Dick Laurent is dead, isn't he?

133
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,130
He is?

134
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:32,480
I didn't think you knew Dick.
How do you know he's dead?

135
00:32:35,936 --> 00:32:37,496
I don't.

136
00:32:38,727 --> 00:32:40,287
I don't know him.

137
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:42,983
Dick can't be dead.

138
00:32:43,729 --> 00:32:45,769
Who told you he was dead?

139
00:32:46,438 --> 00:32:49,798
Who, honey?
Who's dead?

140
00:32:52,522 --> 00:32:54,082
Let's go home.

141
00:32:54,356 --> 00:32:56,556
-But...
-Now. We're leaving now.

142
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:01,861
We never should have come here in the first place.

143
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,280
So, how'd you meet that asshole Andy anyway?

144
00:33:16,318 --> 00:33:18,198
It was a long time ago.

145
00:33:20,778 --> 00:33:23,058
We met at a place called Moke's.

146
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,620
We became friends.

147
00:33:27,778 --> 00:33:29,338
He told me about a job.

148
00:33:30,445 --> 00:33:31,565
What job?

149
00:33:34,821 --> 00:33:36,461
I don't remember.

150
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,490
Anyway...Andy's OK.

151
00:33:45,449 --> 00:33:47,649
Well, He's got some pretty fucked-up friends.

152
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,185
Hey!..
Hey!..

153
00:34:00,826 --> 00:34:02,186
Stay in the car.

154
00:35:30,968 --> 00:35:32,848
I told you to stay in the car.

155
00:35:33,134 --> 00:35:36,334
Why? What is it?

156
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:39,941
Why did you make me stay out here?

157
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:46,199
I'll tell you why, because I thought someone was inside the house.

158
00:35:49,264 --> 00:35:51,624
Was there?

159
00:35:53,681 --> 00:35:55,481
No, of course not.

160
00:38:41,295 --> 00:38:42,175
Fred?

161
00:38:50,005 --> 00:38:52,525
Fred, where are you?

162
00:41:47,642 --> 00:41:48,282
Renee!

163
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:51,450
Renee!

164
00:41:52,144 --> 00:41:54,104
Sit down, Killer!

165
00:41:58,852 --> 00:42:00,652
I didn't kill her.

166
00:42:03,772 --> 00:42:05,812
Tell me I didn't kill her.

167
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:23,842
We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree.

168
00:42:30,526 --> 00:42:34,966
Fred Madison, the jury having found
you guilty of murder in the first degree,

169
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:38,921
it is my order that you be put to death in the electric chair.

170
00:42:52,488 --> 00:42:56,688
Make yourself to home, fella.

171
00:43:05,032 --> 00:43:06,672
Stick your hand out, chief.

172
00:45:21,349 --> 00:45:22,469
Something wrong?

173
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,536
It's...my head.

174
00:45:55,730 --> 00:45:57,010
You sleeping OK?

175
00:45:58,064 --> 00:45:58,704
No.

176
00:46:00,606 --> 00:46:02,646
I can't sleep.

177
00:46:52,324 --> 00:46:53,884
You'll sleep now.

178
00:46:55,575 --> 00:46:57,775
Take him back to his cell.

179
00:46:59,534 --> 00:47:00,574
Let's go.

180
00:47:12,828 --> 00:47:13,468
Guard!

181
00:47:17,954 --> 00:47:18,594
Guard!

182
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:32,055
Guard!

183
00:47:38,083 --> 00:47:38,643
Hey!

184
00:47:42,334 --> 00:47:43,454
What do you want?

185
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:48,051
Aspirin.
My head.

186
00:47:50,836 --> 00:47:52,556
Hey! Hey!

187
00:48:05,588 --> 00:48:09,508
Shit. That wife killer's looking pretty fucked up.

188
00:48:10,339 --> 00:48:11,859
Which one?

189
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:00,101
Pete!

190
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:02,548
Please don't go!

191
00:50:04,152 --> 00:50:04,792
No. Pete!

192
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,140
Pete!..Pete!..Pete!
Wait a minute!

193
00:51:36,086 --> 00:51:38,446
Fuck me!

194
00:51:48,255 --> 00:51:49,735
All right. What's the situation?

195
00:51:50,005 --> 00:51:52,965
I'm not entirely certain, captain.
You'll have to see for yourself.

196
00:52:09,175 --> 00:52:10,135
Right here.

197
00:52:15,676 --> 00:52:17,396
That's not Fred Madison.

198
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:21,439
No, Sir. It's not.

199
00:52:25,929 --> 00:52:28,569
-Who is it?
-I couldn't say, Sir.

200
00:52:30,845 --> 00:52:32,045
Captain Luneau?

201
00:52:32,845 --> 00:52:33,885
Yeah, Mike?

202
00:52:34,929 --> 00:52:35,649
Captain...

203
00:52:36,472 --> 00:52:38,832
This is some spooky shit we got here.

204
00:52:48,641 --> 00:52:51,521
Well, Gentlemen, we know who the stranger is.

205
00:52:53,225 --> 00:52:56,185
His name is Peter Raymond Dayton.
24 years old.

206
00:52:57,058 --> 00:53:00,258
Arrested 5 years ago for auto theft

207
00:53:01,102 --> 00:53:03,702
for which he was put on probation for 1 year.

208
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:11,574
He lives with his parents. William and
Candace Dayton, at 814 Garland Avenue.

209
00:54:03,864 --> 00:54:04,504
So...

210
00:54:46,245 --> 00:54:48,445
-Here.
-Thanks, Lou.

211
00:56:40,392 --> 00:56:42,952
Where the fuck have you been, man?

212
00:56:43,683 --> 00:56:45,243
-Hey! -Hiya. -Hi.
-Hey, guy.

213
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,000
-Hey, man.
-What's up man?

214
00:56:49,852 --> 00:56:52,292
Well, you look like shit.

215
00:56:52,603 --> 00:56:54,043
Yeah. What happened?

216
00:56:55,853 --> 00:56:57,733
Just haven't been feeling so good.

217
00:56:58,022 --> 00:56:59,902
You're not contagious, are you?

218
00:57:00,188 --> 00:57:01,708
No. Uh-uh. Don't think so.

219
00:57:01,981 --> 00:57:03,861
All right. Well, let's go for a drive then.

220
00:57:04,147 --> 00:57:06,787
Different kinds of fruits grow and ripen.

221
00:57:07,522 --> 00:57:10,322
It takes many strawberries to fill a bucket.

222
00:57:10,648 --> 00:57:13,448
But it's worth it when you know that...

223
00:57:13,856 --> 00:57:15,176
-Come on.
-Hoh.

224
00:57:15,691 --> 00:57:16,971
Come on. I'll lead.

225
00:57:17,358 --> 00:57:20,718
...and a glass of fresh, cold milk from grandmother's cow.

226
00:57:23,276 --> 00:57:24,076
See ya later.

227
00:57:25,068 --> 00:57:28,588
-I'm gonna go out with these clowns for a while.
-That should do you some good.

228
00:57:30,109 --> 00:57:34,389
-Good night. -See ya.
-Good night.

229
00:58:03,616 --> 00:58:05,256
What's happening to you?

230
00:58:07,075 --> 00:58:08,875
What happened to your face?

231
00:58:10,701 --> 00:58:13,421
-I don't know?
-What do you mean, you don't know?

232
00:58:14,703 --> 00:58:16,983
You've been acting strange lately.

233
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:18,939
Like the other night.

234
00:58:21,619 --> 00:58:22,739
What night?

235
00:58:23,453 --> 00:58:25,653
The last time I saw you.

236
00:58:26,663 --> 00:58:28,063
I don't remember.

237
00:58:39,582 --> 00:58:41,222
You still care about me?

238
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:08,518
Pete!

239
00:59:11,545 --> 00:59:13,345
-Arnie!
-Where you been?

240
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:16,110
-How you doing?
-It's good you're back...

241
00:59:16,463 --> 00:59:19,103
...Wonderful.
-Good to see you, man.

242
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:20,061
Listen, man, a lot of people...

243
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:23,540
...gonna be real happy that you're back, including me.

244
00:59:23,922 --> 00:59:25,442
Well, it's good to be back.

245
00:59:25,714 --> 00:59:27,754
Mr. Smith has been waiting for you.

246
00:59:28,050 --> 00:59:29,330
Yeah, I'll take care of him.

247
00:59:29,592 --> 00:59:32,112
And Mr. Eddy called.

248
00:59:32,425 --> 00:59:36,465
-Can I call him and tell him to come in?
-Yeah. Call him. Tell him I'm back.

249
00:59:37,300 --> 00:59:40,140
-And, uh, you know, I'm ready to work.
-You're ready to work?
-Yeah.

250
00:59:40,468 --> 00:59:42,748
-Well, let's go to work.
-All right, Buddy.

251
00:59:46,468 --> 00:59:47,988
Petey's back!

252
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:07,493
There's 9 People down here.

253
01:00:08,515 --> 01:00:13,115
And you're gonna ask 7 of them.
If you get that price from one of them,...

254
01:00:13,890 --> 01:00:16,330
...I'll let you ask the other 2.

255
01:00:25,975 --> 01:00:27,335
Hey, Pete!

256
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:31,687
Pete!

257
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,647
Where's Pete?

258
01:00:37,062 --> 01:00:38,342
He's back there!

259
01:00:38,604 --> 01:00:39,404
Mr. Eddy!

260
01:00:41,230 --> 01:00:42,270
Hey!

261
01:00:46,356 --> 01:00:47,756
What happened?

262
01:00:48,689 --> 01:00:50,169
-Somebody giving you trouble?
-No. No trouble.

263
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:54,039
'Cause if somebody's giving you trouble, Pete,...

264
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:57,080
...I can take care of the problem...
Like that!

265
01:00:57,398 --> 01:01:01,598
-No. I'm fine, Mr. Eddy.
-I mean it, Pete. Like...that!

266
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,305
Thank you. Really. I'm fine.
So, uh, what do you want,...

267
01:01:04,607 --> 01:01:08,287
...just a regular tune-up?
-I want you to take a ride with me.

268
01:01:09,068 --> 01:01:11,188
I don't like the sound of something.

269
01:01:11,485 --> 01:01:15,405
-OK. I got to check in with the boss.
-It's OK with Arnie. Come on, let's go.

270
01:01:50,784 --> 01:01:52,984
Pull it over, but keep it running.

271
01:02:14,351 --> 01:02:16,711
Best goddamn ears in town.

272
01:02:31,645 --> 01:02:33,285
Give that a try.

273
01:02:39,606 --> 01:02:44,526
Beautiful...Smooth as shit from a duck's ass.

274
01:02:47,523 --> 01:02:50,563
-Let's take a ride.
-Whatever you say, Mr. Eddy.

275
01:03:04,526 --> 01:03:06,486
It's a beautiful day.

276
01:03:13,904 --> 01:03:15,784
-You did a great job, Pete.
-Yeah.

277
01:03:17,237 --> 01:03:19,837
Well, you know I like working on this car, Mr. Eddy.

278
01:03:37,158 --> 01:03:40,758
Shit. That cocksucker doing what I think he's doing?

279
01:04:12,373 --> 01:04:13,853
This is where mechanical excellence...

280
01:04:14,123 --> 01:04:17,643
...and 1400 horsepower pays off.

281
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,056
Ahh...Oh, oh, God!

282
01:05:00,339 --> 01:05:04,699
Don't you ever fucking tailgate!

283
01:05:05,383 --> 01:05:07,183
-Ever!
-Tell him you won't tailgate.

284
01:05:07,466 --> 01:05:08,266
Ever!

285
01:05:08,717 --> 01:05:11,837
-I won't ever...
-Do you know how many fucking car lengths it takes...

286
01:05:12,217 --> 01:05:15,257
...to stop a car at 35 miles an hour?!

287
01:05:15,593 --> 01:05:18,953
6 fucking car lengths!
That's 106 fucking feet, Mister!

288
01:05:20,051 --> 01:05:22,571
If I had to stop suddenly, you would've hit me!

289
01:05:22,884 --> 01:05:27,244
I want you to get a fucking driver's manual!
I want you to study that motherfucker!

290
01:05:27,678 --> 01:05:29,878
And I want you to obey the goddamn rules!

291
01:05:30,179 --> 01:05:33,939
50 fucking thousand people were
killed on the highway last

292
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:37,107
Because of fucking assholes like you!

293
01:05:37,763 --> 01:05:43,603
-Tell me you're going to get a manual!
-I will ge-get a manual.

294
01:05:46,557 --> 01:05:48,197
Fucking ldiot!

295
01:05:48,515 --> 01:05:51,475
Oh!.Aah!.Oh, Gooood!

296
01:06:30,899 --> 01:06:32,699
I'm sorry about that, Pete.

297
01:06:33,607 --> 01:06:37,287
But tailgating is one thing I cannot tolerate.

298
01:06:38,982 --> 01:06:40,782
Yeah, I can see that.

299
01:06:51,694 --> 01:06:52,574
Wait a minute!

300
01:06:58,070 --> 01:07:00,350
-Thanks, Mr. Eddy.
-No, thank you.

301
01:07:00,988 --> 01:07:02,948
I'm bringing the Caddy by tomorrow.

302
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,760
You like pornos?

303
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:09,391
-Pornos?
-Give you a boner?

304
01:07:10,656 --> 01:07:13,336
Uh, No, No thanks. No.

305
01:07:14,073 --> 01:07:15,513
Suit yourself, champ.

306
01:07:16,823 --> 01:07:20,663
-Well, Uh, I-I'll see you then.
-You will.

307
01:07:27,408 --> 01:07:28,848
Damn!

308
01:07:36,911 --> 01:07:39,871
Lou, you recognize that guy?

309
01:07:42,287 --> 01:07:44,647
Yeah...Laurent.

310
01:08:55,968 --> 01:08:59,648
-What do you want?
-Want to go for a drive?

311
01:09:01,594 --> 01:09:02,874
I don't know.

312
01:09:04,676 --> 01:09:06,316
Get in, Baby!

313
01:09:28,515 --> 01:09:29,315
Come here!

314
01:10:12,439 --> 01:10:15,959
-Why don't you like me?
-I do like you.

315
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:18,061
How much?

316
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:28,774
Oh, Pete!

317
01:11:35,205 --> 01:11:35,925
Sheila!

318
01:11:38,580 --> 01:11:40,020
Sheila!

319
01:12:22,756 --> 01:12:24,556
What'd you change it for?

320
01:12:25,673 --> 01:12:26,793
I like that.

321
01:12:28,173 --> 01:12:29,453
Well, I don't.

322
01:12:39,426 --> 01:12:40,826
I like that!

323
01:13:16,099 --> 01:13:18,859
I'm leaving the Caddy like I told you.

324
01:13:19,224 --> 01:13:21,864
-Think you'll get a chance to give her the once-over today?
-Sure.

325
01:13:22,683 --> 01:13:25,483
Uh, you want to pick it up later on
...or in the morning?

326
01:13:26,309 --> 01:13:29,589
Well, if you think you can finish it,
I'll be back later today.

327
01:13:30,017 --> 01:13:33,537
-It'll be done.
-You're my man, Pete.

328
01:15:21,039 --> 01:15:24,719
Don't let that thing upset you.

329
01:15:51,420 --> 01:15:54,300
Holy smokes!

330
01:16:21,135 --> 01:16:22,175
Hey!

331
01:16:24,551 --> 01:16:26,111
I'm Alice Wakefield.

332
01:16:27,010 --> 01:16:28,370
Pete Dayton.

333
01:16:30,594 --> 01:16:33,714
-I was here earlier.
-Yeah, I remember.

334
01:16:41,013 --> 01:16:43,213
How'd you like to take me to dinner?

335
01:16:45,263 --> 01:16:46,983
I don't know.

336
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:54,136
OK.

337
01:16:55,724 --> 01:16:57,844
Why don't I take you to dinner?

338
01:17:00,683 --> 01:17:04,603
Look, I don't think this is a very good idea.

339
01:17:12,393 --> 01:17:13,833
Do you have a phone?

340
01:17:17,061 --> 01:17:18,021
Yeah.

341
01:17:19,103 --> 01:17:21,143
It's right...lt's right there.

342
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:24,744
I have to call myself another taxi.

343
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:37,320
Hello? Van Nuys?

344
01:17:37,857 --> 01:17:41,537
Can I have the number for Vanguard Cab?

345
01:17:55,276 --> 01:17:59,236
Hello. Yes, I need a Taxi.
Arnie's garage, the corner of fifth...

346
01:18:00,277 --> 01:18:03,637
Hello. Yeah, we're not going to need that cab.
Thanks.

347
01:18:20,488 --> 01:18:23,368
Maybe we should just skip dinner.

348
01:18:57,038 --> 01:18:58,438
Take my clothes off!

349
01:19:02,746 --> 01:19:05,586
Fucker gets more pussy than a toilet seat.

350
01:19:56,673 --> 01:19:59,553
-I want more.
-Me, too.

351
01:20:04,593 --> 01:20:10,193
-Can I call you?
-Yeah. Call me at home. I'll give you the number.

352
01:20:16,885 --> 01:20:17,845
OK, Baby.

353
01:20:46,391 --> 01:20:51,391
Hey! Up here. Come on up, Baby.
I already got the room.

354
01:21:26,357 --> 01:21:29,037
I'll get it.
Hello?

355
01:21:30,065 --> 01:21:33,105
Meow, meow. It's me.

356
01:21:33,483 --> 01:21:34,923
Hey, Baby.

357
01:21:36,525 --> 01:21:39,125
I can't see you tonight.

358
01:21:42,693 --> 01:21:43,813
OK.

359
01:21:45,569 --> 01:21:47,769
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.

360
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:50,390
Sure.

361
01:21:52,529 --> 01:21:57,449
I think he suspects something. We have to be careful.

362
01:22:00,739 --> 01:22:02,299
I miss you.

363
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,160
Pete?

364
01:22:08,698 --> 01:22:10,018
Me, too.

365
01:22:11,948 --> 01:22:13,908
I'll call you again.

366
01:23:52,468 --> 01:23:54,028
What a fucking job.

367
01:23:54,927 --> 01:23:56,567
His or ours, Lou?

368
01:23:58,677 --> 01:23:59,717
Ours, Hank.

369
01:24:25,308 --> 01:24:27,748
-Hey.
-Sit down a minute!

370
01:24:28,808 --> 01:24:31,368
-What's up?
-Sit down!

371
01:24:34,142 --> 01:24:35,782
You don't look so good.

372
01:24:36,476 --> 01:24:39,596
No, I just...just have a headache.

373
01:24:41,184 --> 01:24:42,704
What's going on?

374
01:24:44,395 --> 01:24:46,195
The police called us.

375
01:24:48,521 --> 01:24:49,401
What'd they want?

376
01:24:49,686 --> 01:24:55,046
They want to know if we had a chance
to find out what happened to you the other night.

377
01:24:56,064 --> 01:24:59,024
And they want to know
if you remembered anything.

378
01:25:03,149 --> 01:25:05,429
But I don't remember anything.

379
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:09,390
What'd you tell them?

380
01:25:15,024 --> 01:25:17,224
We're not going to say anything...

381
01:25:17,858 --> 01:25:20,058
...about that night to the police.

382
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:25,390
We saw you that night, Pete.

383
01:25:28,945 --> 01:25:31,225
You came home with your friend Sheila.

384
01:25:33,571 --> 01:25:34,291
Sheila?

385
01:25:37,739 --> 01:25:40,179
Yeah. There was a man with you.

386
01:25:41,321 --> 01:25:45,001
What is this? I mean, why didn't you tell me anything?

387
01:25:50,447 --> 01:25:51,887
Who's the man?

388
01:25:53,574 --> 01:25:56,774
I've never seen him before in my life.

389
01:26:02,368 --> 01:26:04,008
What happened to me?

390
01:26:07,075 --> 01:26:10,195
Please, please, Dad, Tell me!

391
01:26:29,163 --> 01:26:30,283
Hey, Pete! Hey!

392
01:26:31,746 --> 01:26:32,786
Hey!

393
01:26:44,541 --> 01:26:45,261
Hey!

394
01:26:46,500 --> 01:26:47,300
Mr. Eddy.

395
01:26:58,127 --> 01:27:00,167
Hey, Pete!

396
01:27:01,169 --> 01:27:03,129
-How you doing?
-I'm OK.

397
01:27:03,420 --> 01:27:06,300
I'm sure you noticed that girl
who was with me the other day.

398
01:27:06,671 --> 01:27:09,711
Good looking Blonde.
She stayed in the car.

399
01:27:10,796 --> 01:27:15,396
Her name is Alice. I swear,
I love that girl to death.

400
01:27:18,215 --> 01:27:22,335
If I ever found out
somebody was making out with her...

401
01:27:24,923 --> 01:27:26,723
I'd take this

402
01:27:27,051 --> 01:27:31,051
and I'd shove it so far up his ass,
it would come out his mouth.

403
01:27:31,426 --> 01:27:34,706
-And then you know what I'd do?
-What?

404
01:27:35,718 --> 01:27:38,438
I'd blow his fucking brains out.

405
01:27:45,678 --> 01:27:49,558
Hey. You're looking good.

406
01:27:50,762 --> 01:27:52,562
What you been up to?

407
01:28:02,474 --> 01:28:03,514
I'll get it.

408
01:28:05,724 --> 01:28:06,364
Hello?

409
01:28:08,641 --> 01:28:14,881
Meet me at the Starlight Hotel
on Sycamore in 20 minutes.

410
01:28:20,684 --> 01:28:21,804
He'll kill us.

411
01:28:25,768 --> 01:28:27,128
Are you...

412
01:28:29,687 --> 01:28:31,407
...positive that he knows?

413
01:28:31,687 --> 01:28:34,567
I'm not positive, but he knows.

414
01:28:37,271 --> 01:28:42,871
So...What are we supposed to do?

415
01:28:46,149 --> 01:28:47,629
I don't know.

416
01:29:18,738 --> 01:29:23,858
If we could just get some money,
we could go away together.

417
01:29:28,655 --> 01:29:30,295
I know a guy.

418
01:29:32,906 --> 01:29:36,026
He pays girls to party with him.

419
01:29:36,865 --> 01:29:38,585
He's always got a lot of cash.

420
01:29:40,241 --> 01:29:42,041
He'd be easy to rob.

421
01:29:43,659 --> 01:29:48,099
Then we'd have the money.
We could go away.

422
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:52,484
We could be together.

423
01:30:01,121 --> 01:30:02,841
Have you partied with him?

424
01:30:09,455 --> 01:30:10,815
Did you like it?

425
01:30:12,997 --> 01:30:14,037
No.

426
01:30:15,080 --> 01:30:16,440
It was part of the deal.

427
01:30:17,789 --> 01:30:18,829
What deal?

428
01:30:23,165 --> 01:30:25,605
-He works for Mr. Eddy.
-Yeah?

429
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:29,540
-And what's he do?
-He makes films for Mr. Eddy.

430
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:33,700
-Pornos?
-Yeah.

431
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:37,400
How did you get in with these
fucking people, Alice?

432
01:30:37,710 --> 01:30:41,390
-Pete...
-No. Pete. I want to know how it happened.

433
01:30:46,295 --> 01:30:48,335
It was a long time ago.

434
01:30:50,171 --> 01:30:54,211
I met this guy at a place called Moke's.
We became friends.

435
01:30:56,046 --> 01:30:58,006
He told me about a job.

436
01:31:03,465 --> 01:31:04,745
In pornos?

437
01:31:08,006 --> 01:31:13,006
No. Just a job. I didn't know what.

438
01:31:16,260 --> 01:31:19,780
He made an appointment for me to see a man.

439
01:31:21,010 --> 01:31:22,530
I went to this place.

440
01:31:25,260 --> 01:31:27,060
They made me wait there forever.

441
01:31:29,636 --> 01:31:31,916
There was a guy guarding the door.

442
01:31:36,513 --> 01:31:39,273
In another room, there was this
other guy lifting weights.

443
01:31:46,599 --> 01:31:48,399
I started getting nervous.

444
01:31:50,891 --> 01:31:53,251
When it got dark...

445
01:31:54,516 --> 01:31:57,636
...they brought me into this other room.

446
01:34:21,752 --> 01:34:24,112
Why didn't you just leave?

447
01:34:32,461 --> 01:34:34,581
You liked it, huh?

448
01:34:38,296 --> 01:34:43,536
If you want me to go away,
I'll go away.

449
01:34:49,298 --> 01:34:51,418
I don't want you to go away.

450
01:34:52,340 --> 01:34:53,740
I don't want you to go away.

451
01:35:04,552 --> 01:35:06,432
I love you, Alice.

452
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:13,159
-Should I call Andy?
-Andy?

453
01:35:15,177 --> 01:35:18,057
That's his name, Andy.
Our ticket out of here.

454
01:35:19,179 --> 01:35:21,819
Yeah. Call him.

455
01:35:24,806 --> 01:35:26,926
I'll set it up for tomorrow night.

456
01:35:27,680 --> 01:35:29,960
You meet me at his place at 11:00.

457
01:35:30,474 --> 01:35:35,074
Don't drive, take the bus.
Make sure no one follows you.

458
01:35:35,975 --> 01:35:41,895
His address is easy to remember.
It's 2224 Deep Dell Place.

459
01:35:42,350 --> 01:35:45,230
It's a white Stucco job
on the south side of the street.

460
01:35:45,601 --> 01:35:50,201
I'll be upstairs with Andy.
The back door will be open.

461
01:35:50,768 --> 01:35:54,368
Go through the kitchen into the living room.
There's a bar there.

462
01:35:54,854 --> 01:35:58,974
At 11:15, I'll send Andy down to fix me a drink.

463
01:35:59,354 --> 01:36:02,954
And when he does,
you crack him on the head, OK?

464
01:36:07,104 --> 01:36:07,744
OK.

465
01:36:37,902 --> 01:36:40,502
-You're fucking somebody else, aren't you?
-Sheila!

466
01:36:40,820 --> 01:36:43,100
You fuck me whenever you want.
Sheila! Sheila, stop it!

467
01:36:43,403 --> 01:36:45,523
-You don't call. Who is she?
-Stop it!

468
01:36:45,822 --> 01:36:48,662
-What's the bitch's name?
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, you're sorry?

469
01:36:48,989 --> 01:36:50,549
-Go home!
-You're sorry?
-Sheila, stop it!

470
01:36:50,863 --> 01:36:52,823
You're sorry, you piece of shit!

471
01:36:53,113 --> 01:36:54,513
-You're sorry?
-Go home!

472
01:36:54,780 --> 01:36:56,820
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila, stop, Sheila!
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!

473
01:36:57,198 --> 01:36:59,638
-Fuck you!..Fuck you!
-Sheila...Sheila.

474
01:37:00,073 --> 01:37:04,113
Sheila! Let's both go in and talk about this quietly.

475
01:37:04,699 --> 01:37:06,219
Sheila, come on.

476
01:37:08,741 --> 01:37:10,941
-You are different.
-Sheila!

477
01:37:11,367 --> 01:37:13,567
Tell him!..Tell him!

478
01:37:13,868 --> 01:37:16,588
Sheila, don't. Don't.

479
01:37:18,159 --> 01:37:24,839
I don't care anymore anyway. I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton.

480
01:37:25,703 --> 01:37:31,543
I won't bother you, or any member
of your family ever again.

481
01:37:46,455 --> 01:37:47,495
Pete?

482
01:37:50,583 --> 01:37:52,143
There's a man on the phone.

483
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:55,940
He's called a couple of times tonight.

484
01:37:56,750 --> 01:37:57,790
Who is it?

485
01:37:59,961 --> 01:38:01,521
He won't give his name.

486
01:38:20,796 --> 01:38:21,916
Hello?

487
01:38:22,713 --> 01:38:25,153
Hey, Pete, how you doing?

488
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:31,710
-Who is this?
-You know who it is.

489
01:38:35,382 --> 01:38:36,702
Mr. Eddy?

490
01:38:37,717 --> 01:38:40,597
Yeah. How you doing, Pete?

491
01:38:41,509 --> 01:38:45,269
-OK.
-You're doing OK? That's good, Pete.

492
01:38:47,426 --> 01:38:53,506
-Look, it's late Mr. Eddy, I...
-I'm really glad to know you're doing OK.

493
01:38:55,970 --> 01:39:01,730
-You're sure you're OK? Everything all right?
-Yeah.

494
01:39:04,013 --> 01:39:07,293
I'm really glad to know you're doing good, Pete. Hey!

495
01:39:08,556 --> 01:39:10,436
I want you to talk to a friend of mine.

496
01:39:16,183 --> 01:39:18,623
We've met before, haven't we?

497
01:39:20,183 --> 01:39:21,543
I don't think so.

498
01:39:23,808 --> 01:39:25,768
Where is it you think we've met?

499
01:39:26,183 --> 01:39:29,943
At your house. Don't you remember?

500
01:39:33,852 --> 01:39:37,612
No. No, I don't.

501
01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:41,909
In the East, the far East...

502
01:39:42,228 --> 01:39:47,548
...when a person is sentenced to death,
they're sent to a place where they can't escape.

503
01:39:48,396 --> 01:39:55,236
Never knowing when an executioner may step up behind them
and fire a bullet into the back of their head.

504
01:39:56,856 --> 01:39:58,576
What's going on?

505
01:39:59,316 --> 01:40:01,836
It's been a pleasure talking to you.

506
01:40:02,899 --> 01:40:08,139
Pete, I just wanted to jump on and
tell you that I'm really glad you're doing OK.

507
01:43:23,979 --> 01:43:25,099
You got him.

508
01:43:26,354 --> 01:43:27,474
Alice!

509
01:44:24,781 --> 01:44:25,581
Wow!

510
01:44:29,406 --> 01:44:31,046
We killed him.

511
01:44:40,201 --> 01:44:42,241
You killed him.

512
01:44:45,451 --> 01:44:46,091
Alice?

513
01:44:51,912 --> 01:44:53,112
Alice?

514
01:44:54,620 --> 01:44:56,100
What do we do?

515
01:44:57,579 --> 01:44:59,219
What do we do?

516
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:02,220
We have to get the stuff.

517
01:45:04,872 --> 01:45:06,352
We have to get out of here.

518
01:45:22,125 --> 01:45:23,245
Ah, fuck!

519
01:45:59,715 --> 01:46:00,675
Is that you?

520
01:46:02,424 --> 01:46:03,864
Are both of them you?

521
01:46:13,594 --> 01:46:14,874
That's me.

522
01:46:17,678 --> 01:46:20,038
Honey, are you all right?

523
01:46:25,177 --> 01:46:26,697
Where's the bathroom?

524
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,980
It's upstairs, down the hall.

525
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:30,328
Did you want to talk to me?

526
01:47:33,358 --> 01:47:36,238
Did you want to ask me, why?

527
01:48:34,245 --> 01:48:35,365
What's the matter?

528
01:48:39,162 --> 01:48:40,602
Don't you trust me, Pete?

529
01:48:49,539 --> 01:48:51,579
Stick this in your pants.

530
01:48:59,000 --> 01:49:01,200
I know a fence.

531
01:49:03,958 --> 01:49:08,558
He'll give us money, get us passports
in exchange for all this shit

532
01:49:09,667 --> 01:49:10,867
and Andy's car...

533
01:49:12,378 --> 01:49:15,018
And then we can go anywhere.

534
01:49:30,505 --> 01:49:31,785
Come on, Baby!

535
01:49:48,342 --> 01:49:49,542
Pete, you drive!

536
01:50:05,428 --> 01:50:07,868
Where the fuck are we going, Alice?

537
01:50:10,594 --> 01:50:12,554
Where the fuck are we going?

538
01:50:15,471 --> 01:50:17,591
We have to go to the desert, Baby.

539
01:50:20,223 --> 01:50:22,583
The fence I told you about...

540
01:50:26,683 --> 01:50:28,163
He's at his cabin.

541
01:51:42,197 --> 01:51:43,157
Come on!

542
01:52:31,164 --> 01:52:32,964
We'll have to wait.

543
01:52:54,043 --> 01:52:56,643
Why me, Alice? Why choose me?

544
01:53:04,545 --> 01:53:06,665
You still want me, don't you, Pete?

545
01:53:10,588 --> 01:53:12,628
More than ever.

546
01:55:13,944 --> 01:55:15,064
I want you.

547
01:55:24,239 --> 01:55:25,519
I want you.

548
01:55:44,116 --> 01:55:45,236
I want you.

549
01:55:47,283 --> 01:55:48,403
I want you.

550
01:56:07,788 --> 01:56:11,788
You'll never have me.

551
01:57:16,718 --> 01:57:17,678
Here I am.

552
01:58:09,392 --> 01:58:15,472
-Where's Alice?
-Alice who? Her name is Renee.

553
01:58:15,978 --> 01:58:19,578
If she told you her name is Alice, she's lying.

554
01:58:23,854 --> 01:58:27,934
And your name?
What the fuck is your name?!

555
02:01:50,768 --> 02:01:51,408
Renee?

556
02:02:01,855 --> 02:02:03,855
You're coming with me.

557
02:04:06,669 --> 02:04:09,269
What do you guys want?

558
02:05:24,247 --> 02:05:26,127
Now you can hand it back!

559
02:05:35,998 --> 02:05:38,118
You and me, Mister...

560
02:05:41,373 --> 02:05:45,253
We can really outugly them sumbitches...

561
02:05:46,375 --> 02:05:48,015
Can't we?

562
02:06:44,051 --> 02:06:46,411
Ed...Take a look at this!

563
02:06:53,470 --> 02:06:55,350
Yeah. That's her all right.

564
02:06:56,845 --> 02:07:00,205
That's Fred Madison's wife with Dick Laurent.

565
02:07:00,764 --> 02:07:02,644
And Mr. Dent-Head over there.

566
02:07:04,348 --> 02:07:06,788
We got Pete Dayton's prints all over this place.

567
02:07:07,847 --> 02:07:09,567
You know what I think, Ed?

568
02:07:11,472 --> 02:07:13,352
What is it, AI? What do you think?

569
02:07:14,850 --> 02:07:17,490
I think there's no such thing as a bad coincidence.

570
02:08:21,070 --> 02:08:22,550
Dick Laurent is dead.
