1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,820
JUDGE: Dominic Toretto.

2
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:41,700
You are hereby sentenced to serve 25 years to life

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,710
at the Lompoc Maximum Security Prison system

4
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,840
without the possibility of early parole.

5
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,410
Here's what we know so far.

6
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,870
This is all the aftermath of a daring, daylight breakout.

7
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,250
There were 26 high-risk inmates being transferred...

8
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,790
A daring midday breakout where everyone onboard has been accounted for,

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,750
except for one, Dominic Toretto.

10
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,050
Police have just released the identity

11
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,130
of the man they believe to have orchestrated the shocking escape

12
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,970
that amazingly resulted in no fatalities this afternoon.

13
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,930
He is former federal agent, Brian O'Conner.

14
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,980
A fierce manhunt is underway for three fugitives tonight.

15
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,890
Multiple federal and local agencies have joined forces

16
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,560
in the search for Dominic Toretto

17
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,020
and his accomplices

18
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,980
Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto.

19
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,780
But despite every eye in the country looking for them

20
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:41,490
where Toretto and O'Conner are now is anyone's guess.

21
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,570
It's got to be it, right?

22
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,050
Let's get out of here. VINCE: Whoa, whoa!

23
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:28,850
Easy, friends. She's with me.

24
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,230
Mia.

25
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,690
Vince.

26
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,400
Buster.

27
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,860
Come on.

28
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,700
Dom here yet?

29
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,030
No.

30
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,780
When was the last time you heard from him?

31
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,040
A couple of weeks ago. Up in Ecuador somewhere.

32
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,460
How does it feel?

33
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,630
What's that?

34
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,590
To be on the other side of a wanted poster?

35
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,760
He'll show up.

36
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,130
Yeah.

37
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,310
Dom's?

38
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,100
Yeah.

39
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,940
Time for bed little one.

40
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,570
Can I bring him?

41
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,780
Of course.

42
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:28,780
Good night.

43
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,760
Excuse me, sorry.

44
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:56,310
Why Rio, Vince?

45
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,650
You mean after you screwed everything up in LA?

46
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,820
Ended up free-falling through South America, you know,

47
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,990
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

48
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,660
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

49
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,180
Does he know?

50
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,740
So, listen.

51
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,200
There is a job coming up.

52
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,160
I was hoping Dom was going to be here by now

53
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,990
but this one is clean enough we can do it without him.

54
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,790
It's a good gig. Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

55
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:01,370
Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

56
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,040
Guy I know is putting together a team to swipe them.

57
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,420
Just need a few more willing bodies.

58
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:09,340
I don't know.

59
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,050
Look, the way the car scene is down here

60
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:15,100
we can unload them quick and get top dollar.

61
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,220
It's easy money.

62
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,810
And from where I'm sitting,

63
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,900
it looks like you both could use the payday.

64
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:04,730
What are you reading?

65
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,650
Travel guide.

66
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,360
Yeah?

67
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:13,950
Tokyo.

68
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,450
Moscow.

69
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:21,040
Goa.

70
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,790
You want to know what all of these places have in common?

71
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Huh?

72
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,420
No extradition.

73
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:42,850
Here we go.

74
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,040
Excuse me, buddy.

75
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,050
Okay.

76
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,030
Hey, we've found them.

77
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,870
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

78
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,760
What is it?

79
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,590
DEA tags. These cars have been seized.

80
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,550
Look who showed up.

81
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,100
God, I'm so happy you're okay.

82
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,560
I thought I told you to lay low.

83
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,270
Been running on fumes. Had to make a call.

84
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,730
Hey! Quit talking. We only got the two-minute window.

85
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,150
Let's go, Vince.

86
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,120
I'm taking the GT40.

87
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:40,820
Ladies first.

88
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:47,950
Hey!

89
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:50,500
Hey!

90
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,790
This car suits me better.

91
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:02,130
See you, baby.

92
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,520
It's okay... we're all going to the same place.

93
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,350
We'll get the car there.

94
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,400
Change of plans. Wait for my call.

95
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,030
Let's go!

96
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
Where is she going?

97
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,050
Where is she going? Hey!

98
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,430
Hey!

99
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,560
We're being robbed! Whatever happens, don't stop the train!

100
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,690
Go after the girl!

101
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:01,900
Hurry up!

102
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,100
Access card! Get the access card!

103
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,630
Shit.

104
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,950
Bridge! There is a bridge!

105
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,630
Luggage car is clear.

106
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,720
One of them down

107
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,730
Freeze!

108
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,120
Oh, shit!

109
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:13,780
You had to make a call, huh?

110
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,490
Shitty call, O'Conner.

111
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:18,660
Shitty call.

112
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:41,310
You two stirred up quite a bit of trouble today.

113
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,390
Three of my men dead.

114
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,020
Three DEA agents along with them.

115
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Of course, this is business

116
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,190
and sometimes things go astray.

117
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,530
All I care about is the car.

118
00:17:55,690 --> 00:17:57,990
Tell me where it is, and I'll let you go.

119
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,240
This roofing plastic says you're full of shit.

120
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,370
I don't know how you guys do business in your part of the world,

121
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,540
but here in Rio,

122
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:13,170
I like it when all parties know what they're up against.

123
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,710
That's funny.

124
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,380
Because it goes both ways.

125
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,180
You know,

126
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,890
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

127
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,600
Wherever she hides

128
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,440
I will find her.

129
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:20,030
The American fugitives killed three DEA agents

130
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,450
during a train robbery...

131
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,450
...Police warn they are armed and extremely dangerous.

132
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:30,580
Anyone with information should contact law enforcement immediately...

133
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,130
Mia?

134
00:19:42,930 --> 00:19:43,930
Hey.

135
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:48,020
You okay?

136
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,140
Yeah, you all right?

137
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:53,600
Hey.

138
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,240
Hey, yeah.

139
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,860
Just like a Toretto.

140
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,950
Where's Vince?

141
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,830
That's a good question.

142
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:11,830
He'll be here.

143
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,170
Guys, we're all over the news.

144
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:16,500
They're blaming us for the killing of those DEA agents on the train.

145
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:19,630
Which means we just jumped to the top of the wanted list.

146
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,340
The feds have got to show everyone their agents are off limits

147
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,930
and they're going to send their best guys.

148
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:25,180
We got to get out of here.

149
00:20:25,510 --> 00:20:28,510
One thing we know for sure

150
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,640
is that they wanted this car.

151
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,480
Because something is in it.

152
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,400
If we find out what it is, we'll know what we're up against.

153
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:58,380
All right, listen up! The men we're after are professional runners.

154
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,300
They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way

155
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,710
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

156
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,840
We find them,

157
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,760
we take them as a team, and we bring them back.

158
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:07,260
And above all else,

159
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,260
we don't ever, ever let them get into cars.

160
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:13,060
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, men. Let's go hunting.

161
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,230
Agente Hobbs! Chief of Police, Joo Alemeida.

162
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,440
Luke.

163
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:23,740
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

164
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

165
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:27,530
Let me tell you something about these two men.

166
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,080
One is a former federal officer, been in deep cover for five years.

167
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,040
He knows every way you're going to come for him.

168
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,210
The other one is a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

169
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:37,790
spent half his life on the run avoiding folks like you.

170
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,750
Well, if there's anything we can do to help the DSS...

171
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,880
Two things. One, I need a translator.

172
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,420
We have plenty in the public relations department.

173
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:46,430
Elena Neves.

174
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
A patrol officer?

175
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,800
You heard me.

176
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,260
But why? We have many more experienced people.

177
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,310
I like her smile.

178
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,440
What's the second thing?

179
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,400
Stay the fuck out of my way.

180
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,830
- Brian. - Hm?

181
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:15,120
I have something I have to tell you.

182
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:17,460
God damn.

183
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,790
What a mess!

184
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,250
Where you been, man?

185
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,800
You better check that tone.

186
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,720
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

187
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,300
Stop it! Both of you.

188
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,810
Where were you, Vince?

189
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,980
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

190
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:41,650
Couldn't get out of there without leading them straight to you.

191
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:42,980
Had to wait them out.

192
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,650
That is such horseshit.

193
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,820
- That was your job, and those were your guys! - Hey!

194
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,490
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

195
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,320
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

196
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,620
Go walk it off.

197
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:10,300
Look, I would love to expand my operations into your countries

198
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,590
but, quite frankly,

199
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,430
your business methods are too violent.

200
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,720
Let me tell you a true story.

201
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:19,890
Five hundred years ago,

202
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:22,150
the Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

203
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:25,860
each trying to get the country from their natives.

204
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,950
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,

205
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:32,490
determined to prove who was boss.

206
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,080
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

207
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,880
Personally, I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

208
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,050
They came bearing gifts.

209
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,260
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

210
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:54,050
Things that the natives couldn't get on their own,

211
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,180
but to continue receiving them,

212
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,390
they had to work for the Portuguese.

213
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:02,350
And that's why all Brazilians speak Portuguese today.

214
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:06,570
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

215
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,900
they will eventually fight back because they have nothing to lose.

216
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,530
And that's the key.

217
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,660
I go into the favelas

218
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:18,240
and give them something to lose.

219
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,370
Electricity, running water,

220
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,580
school rooms for their kids.

221
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,920
And for that taste of a better life,

222
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,460
I own them.

223
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:32,670
Gentlemen.

224
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,810
I apologize for the interruption.

225
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:41,810
Seor Reyes, may I speak with you?

226
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,480
We've found them.

227
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,940
Pardon me, gentlemen.

228
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,000
Almost wish I didn't see that.

229
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,170
Almost.

230
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,420
Wait, Dom.

231
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:16,340
Mia was on that train. My sister!

232
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:19,470
I didn't know. I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

233
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,020
You set up the deal!

234
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,770
I thought the job was for the cars.

235
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,480
I didn't know.All they want is the chip.

236
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,150
Damn!

237
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,440
You should've come clean.

238
00:25:34,610 --> 00:25:36,150
What's going on out here?

239
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,160
Nothing.

240
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,830
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip. I can take this to them.

241
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:44,000
They'll give it to Reyes and set things right.

242
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,120
Get out.

243
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:51,000
What?

244
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,170
Get out!

245
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:02,180
You never listen to me.

246
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,680
Not when I told you he was a cop,

247
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,890
and not now.

248
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:08,400
You never trust me

249
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:10,860
and look where it's gotten us.

250
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,190
Look at our family now.

251
00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,400
I can't go home!

252
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:18,360
Your sister is stuck in this life!

253
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,410
Where's Letty, Dom?

254
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,870
Where's Letty?

255
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:49,770
Plasma cutter.

256
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:53,110
Wilkes, I want a list of every place within 50 miles

257
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:54,940
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

258
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,240
Pass me that manifest.

259
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,910
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

260
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,160
You asked for me?

261
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,330
I did.

262
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,080
May I ask why?

263
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,580
My smile is not that great.

264
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,720
Your husband was an officer who was gunned down in the favela.

265
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,800
Six months later, you upped and joined the force.

266
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:22,090
You're motivated.

267
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:25,810
Plus, I figure you're the only one in Rio who can't be bought.

268
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,430
Am I right?

269
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,430
Yes.

270
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,560
Of course I am.

271
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:31,980
Good news, bad news.

272
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,770
You know I like my dessert first.

273
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,770
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

274
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,110
Found a couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

275
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,780
One set of tracks headed west

276
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,450
until it hit the main highway, then disappeared.

277
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,910
But another set of tracks headed east.

278
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:46,450
A 1 07-inch wheelbase, eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

279
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,950
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

280
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,620
Followed the trail a couple of miles.Pretty easy in this scrub.

281
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,920
Can't move without leaving a sign.

282
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,420
Give me the damn veggies.

283
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,800
The ground rolls into a hardpack and we lost that track, too.

284
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,630
Not necessarily.

285
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,970
That road heads up through the hills into the favelas.

286
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:07,470
Couple of years ago, it was washed out by a storm.

287
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,980
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

288
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,140
If they headed that way, we'll pick up their tracks there.

289
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:15,440
You come prepared.

290
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,070
I'm motivated.

291
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,820
All right, then.

292
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,610
Let's find ourselves a car.

293
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,270
What do you think?

294
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,850
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

295
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:59,360
Look at all these side menus here for data entry.

296
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
Let's check this one.

297
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,450
Look at that.

298
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,950
Same building, same order every week.

299
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
It's a delivery schedule.

300
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,060
What's this?

301
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,480
Drugs?

302
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:39,400
No. That's a dealer pack.

303
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,400
See, most major players, they weigh their money

304
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,400
so they don't have to constantly count it.

305
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,030
Right there, that's 49 kilos.49 kilos is a million in twenties.

306
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:50,200
You're saying each one of these shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

307
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,370
Yeah.

308
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,100
I thought so.

309
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,110
So what is that?

310
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,860
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

311
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,940
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

312
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,030
I think it's safe to say that Reyes is smart to want this back.

313
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:33,120
It's his whole network right there, just laid out on a chip.

314
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,600
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.

315
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,390
Mac, Chato, flank north.

316
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,100
What about me?

317
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:02,270
Stay here.

318
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,950
- Go that way! - The other two went over the wall!

319
00:31:58,450 --> 00:31:59,500
Come on, go! Go!

320
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:59,510
Get on the ground.

321
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,560
I got Toretto. Four blocks north of your...

322
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,070
They already know who you are.

323
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,460
Let's go.

324
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,250
All clear?

325
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:24,650
Clear!

326
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,610
You okay here?

327
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,450
Yeah. I'm good. Thank you.

328
00:35:18,190 --> 00:35:20,990
They're going to be looking for the three of us together now.

329
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,700
We need to split up.

330
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,620
You and Mia head south, I'll lead them away.

331
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,780
No.

332
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,040
Dom is right.

333
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,870
Look how lucky we just got. What happens next time?

334
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,120
We have no choice but to split up.

335
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,460
I'm pregnant.

336
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,750
I already lost my family once.

337
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,590
I'm not going through that again.

338
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,800
Are you kidding me?

339
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,970
No.

340
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,940
I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

341
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:02,440
Dom? Promise me we stick together.

342
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,080
I promise.

343
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,130
Our family just got bigger.

344
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,980
Something doesn't add up.

345
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:40,940
Toretto and O'Conner.

346
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,780
They stay when they're supposed to run,

347
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:46,030
they steal gas then give it away?

348
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,740
Now they're killing federal agents?

349
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,490
It doesn't make any sense.

350
00:36:50,660 --> 00:36:52,450
Here's what makes sense.

351
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,580
All these guys are is names on a list.

352
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,080
They come up, we take them down.

353
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,670
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

354
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,550
Wilkes, we get anything?

355
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,220
Standard forensics.

356
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,090
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

357
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,300
Prints are all over the car.

358
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,470
Anything else?

359
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,850
Yeah, we tracked the owner off the vehicle ID.

360
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:14,390
There are a couple of shell companies in between,

361
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,930
but we finally traced it back to a corporation

362
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:19,770
owned by an investor down here named Hernan Reyes.

363
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:20,940
Investor?

364
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:25,400
If there's anything illegal happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

365
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:27,030
Okay, then so are we.

366
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,240
If he could get us any closer to our guys, I want everything on him.

367
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,780
Chato, you're on the roof.

368
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:33,030
I want you on overwatch in case somebody comes back for something.

369
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,580
Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes, full specs.

370
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,790
If he goes to the john, I want to know how many times he shakes it.

371
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,960
You got it, boss.

372
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,170
Wilkes, Fusco!

373
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,920
Let's put all this mess back together.

374
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,880
That's going to take a while.

375
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,300
Then you better get started.

376
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,220
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

377
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,180
Let's put it back together and find out what's missing.

378
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:23,210
Hey, Dom, what do you remember about your father?

379
00:38:25,670 --> 00:38:27,380
My father.

380
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,840
He used to...

381
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:38,350
He used to have a barbecue every Sunday after church.

382
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,770
For anybody in the neighborhood.

383
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,190
If you didn't go to church, you didn't get any barbecue.

384
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,740
Every single day he was in the shop, and every single night,

385
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,570
he was at the kitchen table with Mia,

386
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:54,910
helping her with her homework.

387
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:58,870
Even after she went to sleep,

388
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,040
he'd stay up for a few more hours

389
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:06,130
so he could learn the next chapter and help her the next day.

390
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,090
I remember everything about my father.

391
00:39:10,710 --> 00:39:11,970
Everything.

392
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,430
That's just it.

393
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,300
I don't remember shit about my dad.

394
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,390
I don't remember him yelling.

395
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,060
I don't remember him smiling.

396
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:27,440
To be honest with you, I don't even remember what the hell he looked like.

397
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:31,650
I don't remember. He just...

398
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,110
He was just never there.

399
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,450
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

400
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:58,260
We can't keep running, Dom.

401
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,430
We got to get out.

402
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,520
We got to get out now.

403
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,100
You're right.

404
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:19,320
Here's how we're going to do it.

405
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,790
We're going to use this.

406
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,790
We're going do one last job.

407
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,540
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

408
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,460
Every dime of it,

409
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,010
and disappear.

410
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:39,640
Forever.

411
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,350
New passports.

412
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,390
New lives

413
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,890
with no more looking over our shoulder.

414
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,520
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

415
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,730
That's right.

416
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:49,310
You realize we're talking about going up against

417
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,810
the most powerful guy in all of Rio?

418
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,570
Yes, we are.

419
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:55,900
Then we're going to need a team.

420
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:04,830
Let's run through the bases real quick. Who do we got?

421
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,330
First we're going to need a chameleon.

422
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,710
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

423
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:13,750
What else?

424
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,880
A fast talker.

425
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,340
Someone who can bullshit their way out of anything.

426
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
I got that.

427
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,930
This guy is going to have a lot of surveillance.

428
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,970
We're going to need someone who's good with circuits.

429
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,690
And with those circuits, Reyes is going to have walls.

430
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:32,150
We're going to need guys to punch through those walls.

431
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,150
What else?

432
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:37,440
Utilities and weapons.

433
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,700
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

434
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,080
Someone to back up every position.

435
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,700
BRIAN: Yeah, what else do we need?

436
00:41:44,870 --> 00:41:46,540
DOM: Most importantly,

437
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,830
we're going to need two precision drivers.

438
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,380
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

439
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,040
Guys that never lose.

440
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,630
You know we got that.

441
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:26,540
Aw, hell, no!

442
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:30,120
I see they really scraped the bottom of the barrel, huh?

443
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:32,580
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

444
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:37,300
When are you going to give Martin Luther King his car back?

445
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:40,220
As soon as you give Rick James his jacket back.

446
00:42:43,470 --> 00:42:44,510
What's up, man?

447
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,600
What's up?

448
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,860
Hmm.

449
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,690
Sexy legs, baby girl.

450
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,070
What time do they open?

451
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:06,740
They open the same time as I pull this trigger.

452
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,740
Want me to open them?

453
00:43:12,410 --> 00:43:15,250
I told you the skinny chick had balls.

454
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:17,920
Looks like she started the party without us.

455
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:20,800
Hey, anybody can talk shit in Spanish, homie.

456
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,050
What's this guy saying?

457
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,680
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish or in English.

458
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,640
Who are these clowns, man?

459
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,810
Circus clowns.

460
00:43:33,890 --> 00:43:36,810
I thought cockfights were illegal in Brazil.

461
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:39,070
I see you all have met.

462
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,780
You know when you called me to come to Rio

463
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:45,740
I assumed it would be for something more exciting than this.

464
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,870
Look at this guy.

465
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:47,950
Long time.

466
00:43:48,030 --> 00:43:49,080
I missed you, man.

467
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Good to see you.

468
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,240
Brother.

469
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,410
What's up?

470
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:54,410
Yo, check this out. This is Tej.

471
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,330
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

472
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:58,000
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

473
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,500
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

474
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:02,210
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

475
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,800
I've heard about you.

476
00:44:04,970 --> 00:44:06,380
Nice digs.

477
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,350
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

478
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:10,560
So what's this all about, Dom?

479
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,480
Yeah, man, why did you drag us halfmay around the world?

480
00:44:14,140 --> 00:44:16,770
Because we got a job.

481
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:19,480
All right, so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

482
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:21,270
And he runs the drug scene down here.

483
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,900
He's never been busted because he doesn't leave a paper trail.

484
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:26,030
No paper trail means no banks.

485
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,200
And no banks means cash houses.

486
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,700
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

487
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:32,950
Spread throughout the city.

488
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,040
And we're going to hit them all.

489
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:37,370
All of them?

490
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:38,830
All of them.

491
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,840
That sounds crazy.

492
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,880
You bring us to a whole other country

493
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:45,090
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

494
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,840
I thought this was business.

495
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,430
Sounds personal to me.

496
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,970
Is that what this is?

497
00:44:52,140 --> 00:44:53,600
I got love for y'all,

498
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:55,890
but personal ain't good business.

499
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,730
I can't do this, homie.

500
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,070
So what we're talking about is $100 million.

501
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,150
You say what?

502
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,660
Hundred...

503
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,870
See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

504
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:13,990
and I know we just met, but you just, kind of, got to...

505
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,830
That's right, $100 million,

506
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,330
and everything we take, we split even.

507
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,290
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

508
00:45:22,250 --> 00:45:23,670
I am down.

509
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,260
I'm in.

510
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,220
Eleven million.

511
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,340
Sounds like a whole lot of vaginal activity to me.

512
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,010
You can't pull off 10 heists on the same mark.

513
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,180
You just can't.

514
00:45:35,350 --> 00:45:36,810
As soon as we hit the first one,

515
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,730
they're going to do everything they can to protect the rest.

516
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,440
Exactly.

517
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,690
Nobody move!

518
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:38,500
That's all of it.

519
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:39,750
You a dead man.

520
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:41,000
You're all dead men!

521
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,330
You don't have a place to hide.

522
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,420
Who's hiding?

523
00:46:47,590 --> 00:46:48,670
Are you crazy?

524
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,920
Are you crazy?

525
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,380
Do you know whose house this is?

526
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:53,010
Whose money are you stealing?

527
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,850
We ain't stealing it.

528
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:16,950
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

529
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,040
Tell him there's more coming.

530
00:47:25,790 --> 00:47:26,920
Voila

531
00:47:27,630 --> 00:47:28,630
Turn it over.

532
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:38,050
She's running on all eight. Checks out fine.

533
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:42,480
Keep looking.

534
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:48,110
Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.

535
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:17,340
It's a goddamn shame putting bullshit like that on a classic.

536
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,760
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

537
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,940
They took the chip.

538
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,690
We got a hit on the police scanner.

539
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,780
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

540
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:40,160
Address cross-checks against property owned by one of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

541
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:41,280
All right, if that's our guys

542
00:48:41,450 --> 00:48:43,950
then whatever was on that chip led them directly to that house.

543
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:45,290
It's them, for sure.

544
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,660
How do you know that?

545
00:48:46,830 --> 00:48:51,170
Because no one else in Rio is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

546
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:05,730
Explain.

547
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,980
They invaded the Leblon house.

548
00:49:08,350 --> 00:49:09,560
Who invaded?

549
00:49:09,730 --> 00:49:12,150
The men from the train.

550
00:49:20,490 --> 00:49:22,700
How much did they take?

551
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:24,660
They didn't take anything.

552
00:49:24,830 --> 00:49:28,370
They burned it!

553
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,170
They burned my money?

554
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:33,420
Yes. And said there's more coming.

555
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:42,640
Okay...

556
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:53,190
Then this...

557
00:49:55,070 --> 00:49:56,530
...is what we're going to do.

558
00:50:03,070 --> 00:50:04,700
Clean the houses.

559
00:50:04,950 --> 00:50:09,210
I want that money under lock and key...

560
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:11,620
...within an hour.

561
00:50:11,790 --> 00:50:14,040
Understand?

562
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:17,880
Understood.

563
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:39,070
Number One is on the move, man.

564
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:54,920
Two is on the move.

565
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,610
I got mine.

566
00:51:41,670 --> 00:51:43,680
I got eyes on Five.

567
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:13,660
I know y'all said they were consolidating the money somewhere,

568
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:17,000
but, y'all ain't going to believe this.

569
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:29,050
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

570
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,680
If he's moving it into a police station

571
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:34,350
he's got some serious brass in his pocket.

572
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,810
Looks like this is going to be a shorter trip than I thought...

573
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,020
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

574
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:41,690
"Can't"? You mean, "shouldn't."

575
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:44,780
I think this doesn't change a thing.

576
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:50,030
I say we stick to the plan.

577
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,870
You say what?

578
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,700
This just went from Mission: Impossible

579
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:55,710
to Mission: In-freaking-sanity.

580
00:52:57,790 --> 00:52:59,040
Whatever, man.

581
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,540
I ain't scared,

582
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:02,420
I'm just letting you all know, going in that building is crazy.

583
00:53:02,590 --> 00:53:03,800
I got this.

584
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:08,890
What time was the robbery?

585
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:10,890
Around 11 :00.

586
00:53:12,430 --> 00:53:13,640
Here we go.

587
00:53:15,810 --> 00:53:17,310
Enhance it.

588
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,770
Their faces are covered.

589
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:22,150
Run it through FRS.

590
00:53:28,150 --> 00:53:29,780
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

591
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:35,700
Wilkes! Run the photos of known associates of Toretto and O'Conner

592
00:53:35,790 --> 00:53:38,660
against customs entries into Brazil in the last two weeks.

593
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,750
Check planes, trains, boats, everything short of the goddamn space shuttle.

594
00:53:48,090 --> 00:53:51,260
They can change their names but they can't change their faces.

595
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:53,260
Something big is going down.

596
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:56,270
That's a 1970 Charger.

597
00:53:56,430 --> 00:53:58,520
Fusco! Upload these specs into the database.

598
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:01,190
Have the computer cross-check it with overhead satellites every 15 minutes,

599
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:02,940
the van behind it, too.

600
00:54:03,110 --> 00:54:05,820
If these vehicles move in the streets of Rio, I want to know about it.

601
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:16,040
Everything okay?

602
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:17,120
Everything is okay.

603
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,870
Who is this Hobbs? This Federal Agent running around town?

604
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:21,210
Some American cowboy.

605
00:54:21,790 --> 00:54:22,880
He's handled.

606
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,630
He killed sixteen of our men.

607
00:54:25,290 --> 00:54:26,500
Handle him better.

608
00:54:26,670 --> 00:54:27,710
Look...

609
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,970
He requested a rookie patrol officer as his assistant.

610
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:35,810
They won't be a problem.

611
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:05,750
It's all here?

612
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:06,840
Yes.

613
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:10,010
What about Toretto and O'Conner? Where are they?

614
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,380
Nothing yet.

615
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,220
But I have all our officers searching.

616
00:55:15,050 --> 00:55:16,180
Not good enough.

617
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,510
Put a price on their heads.

618
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:20,060
High enough...

619
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,770
...to get every pair of eyes in the city searching for them.

620
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:32,450
The beauty of public offices

621
00:55:35,410 --> 00:55:36,450
Public records.

622
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,990
This is where he's keeping the money.

623
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,200
The vault in the evidence room.

624
00:55:40,330 --> 00:55:44,660
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's attention, right here, for a second?

625
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:48,290
We're talking about breaking into a police station.

626
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,840
Is anyone listening to those words? Anybody? Popo...

627
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:54,470
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.

628
00:55:54,630 --> 00:55:55,760
People we don't like.

629
00:55:55,930 --> 00:55:58,760
You know, police stations are designed to keep people in, not out.

630
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,390
That's why it's a stealth mission.

631
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:03,270
We'll be in and out before they even know we were there.

632
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,940
Well, we'll need to get eyes in there.

633
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:07,610
At least to find out the make and model of that vault.

634
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:11,070
So the vault and then, so...

635
00:56:11,230 --> 00:56:12,610
It's crazy.

636
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,610
Who's supposed to do all this?

637
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,920
What do you mean?

638
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,170
Why me?

639
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,130
Because you got the biggest mouth.

640
00:56:30,290 --> 00:56:32,300
That's for damn sure.

641
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:40,010
Ooh.

642
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:43,270
Hello, beautiful.

643
00:56:43,430 --> 00:56:45,980
Look at those dimples. Sexy, sexy.

644
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:48,100
Love those glasses. Where did you get them from?

645
00:56:48,270 --> 00:56:50,650
Are those like Gucci frames or something?

646
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,940
No English?

647
00:56:52,110 --> 00:56:54,940
No, no, no. Damn.

648
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:56,450
How are you, sir?

649
00:56:56,860 --> 00:57:00,620
Special Agent O'Conner. US Federal Bureau of Investigation.

650
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,120
It says Caucasian.

651
00:57:02,290 --> 00:57:05,120
That's a tan. You know, a tan?

652
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:11,880
Look, I'm working this case and I got some evidence here to be held.

653
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,460
But I need to get in and check your storage facility first.

654
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:15,550
Nope.

655
00:57:15,630 --> 00:57:18,840
Look, I know you're a true professional, and I respect you, I promise.

656
00:57:19,010 --> 00:57:21,140
You know, it looks like you work out a little bit, too.

657
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,810
What do you bench, about 350?

658
00:57:24,140 --> 00:57:25,310
Ah, shit.

659
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,730
Look, I'm just trying to do my job, man.

660
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:30,650
My boss sent me here to just make sure that everything was safe.

661
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:31,810
It will be safe.

662
00:57:31,980 --> 00:57:33,650
Let me just come in and take a quick peek.

663
00:57:33,730 --> 00:57:34,820
Nope.

664
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,490
Come on, man. Hook a brother up, please?

665
00:57:37,650 --> 00:57:39,320
Nope. And you're not my brother.

666
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:40,620
Brother from another mother?

667
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,830
Look! No one enters the facility but authorized evidence personnel.

668
00:57:43,990 --> 00:57:45,080
Now stop wasting my time.

669
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,250
I'm going to call the embassy.

670
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:47,830
No, no, no! No, we're good.

671
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:50,170
We don't need to call them. For what? We're good.

672
00:57:50,330 --> 00:57:52,920
Here, I got the box. We're all good.

673
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,840
I promise you. Thank you so much for your time.

674
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,090
Swear to God, if you were on the other side of that glass

675
00:57:58,260 --> 00:58:00,720
I'd bust your damn face in. Now translate that.

676
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:23,030
It's done. See, I think I make a better special agent than you ever did.

677
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:26,370
Well, that depends on how you define "special."

678
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,750
Come on, now. Let's see what we got.

679
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,380
Not funny.

680
00:58:39,590 --> 00:58:41,300
All right, come on.

681
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,890
Dawg, you still can't drive.

682
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,400
Now, I see why you're always getting into accidents.

683
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,730
You can't even drive a damn remote control car.

684
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,730
I'm going to need you to shut up right now.

685
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:57,820
I'm not going to shut up.

686
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,940
Shut up.

687
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:00,570
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

688
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,120
Give me the remote, dawg. Go left.

689
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,330
It looks like something right over there to the left. What is that?

690
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:08,580
What is that?

691
00:59:09,910 --> 00:59:10,910
Bingo.

692
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,080
What is that, six-by-six?

693
00:59:14,250 --> 00:59:15,250
Eight-by-twelve?

694
00:59:15,420 --> 00:59:16,790
Seven-by-twelve.

695
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,010
Fitted with 18-inch-thick steel reinforced walls

696
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:23,630
with a insulated copper core to protect against thermal lance.

697
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:27,180
A Class-3 electronic lock with a surefire Griffin retumbler

698
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,640
and a biometric palm scanner. Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

699
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,440
Do I want to know how you know all that?

700
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:35,440
I had a life before you knew me, O'Conner.

701
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,310
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

702
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:39,110
She is a beauty, though, man.

703
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,320
A "beauty" as in "good"?

704
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,320
"Beauty" as in, she's going to start off playing hard to get.

705
00:59:44,610 --> 00:59:46,700
Then, no matter how much I caress her,

706
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:48,530
no matter how much I love her,

707
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,950
in the end, she still ain't going to give up that ass.

708
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,420
It's one of the toughest vaults to crack in the business.

709
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,500
And we ain't gonna go get anywhere with it

710
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,000
unless we got a duplicate to practice with

711
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,000
Bet that.

712
01:00:05,740 --> 01:00:07,400
So assuming you'll breach the safe.

713
01:00:07,740 --> 01:00:09,000
How do we get in?

714
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,000
Yeah, I've been thinking about the way in

715
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,400
The wall to the evidence room.

716
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,600
That's alarmed.

717
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
So, that's not happening.

718
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,500
Then we got this one here.

719
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,200
But there's a guard shack outside.

720
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
So that's no good.

721
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,200
But this one.

722
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,400
This one shares a wall with the basement bathroom.

723
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,000
So, what about the money?

724
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,000
That's gonna be some heavy shit to move.

725
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,200
And you're talking about five ton cash weight.

726
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,140
Yeah, but that's the thing about the bathroom.

727
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,700
It's got a vent that leads to the parking garage.

728
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
All we gotta do is pop that

729
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
vent and then pass the money through to some waiting cars.

730
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,500
Leo, Santos.

731
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,000
You're up!

732
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,140
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

733
01:00:48,310 --> 01:00:50,390
Yo, why you got to be so negative all the time, man?

734
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,060
I ain't negative.

735
01:00:53,270 --> 01:00:55,980
I'm just positive you're going to mess it up.

736
01:00:56,150 --> 01:00:59,150
I'm telling you, man, you got issues.

737
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,910
Next time if there's no elevator, I'm not coming.

738
01:01:08,450 --> 01:01:11,450
You need to learn to relax, loco.

739
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,100
You better hurry up, we got less than a minute.

740
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:41,280
Why do you always set the timer so short?

741
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,470
I hope you know where you're going.

742
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,470
I got this. Relax, man.

743
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,470
Relax.

744
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:24,570
...a police station.

745
01:02:24,740 --> 01:02:26,200
Relax.

746
01:02:37,330 --> 01:02:40,090
You used too much explosive! Again.

747
01:02:41,170 --> 01:02:42,840
Too much, too little...

748
01:02:43,420 --> 01:02:44,460
It's all the same.

749
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:49,930
That's some Buddha shit you learned from a book in the prison library, isn't it?

750
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,560
And what you're doing there on the wall...

751
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,480
You got that from the same book, huh?

752
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:56,640
You're so negative, bro.

753
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,920
Can I have some light?

754
01:03:29,340 --> 01:03:31,550
Got it. We got it!

755
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:33,510
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

756
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,890
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too.

757
01:03:36,060 --> 01:03:37,230
Marker optics.

758
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,560
Hundred-degree field-of-view.

759
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,350
Ten seconds oscillation.

760
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:43,020
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

761
01:03:43,270 --> 01:03:45,070
Can't we just tap in and replace the image?

762
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:47,280
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

763
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,240
They would know we were in the system.

764
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,410
The best we can do is peek.

765
01:03:51,570 --> 01:03:54,080
We're going to need some real fast cars to get through this.

766
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,580
Not just fast.

767
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:57,870
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

768
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,870
We're going to need something agile.

769
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,670
You guys mock up a track.

770
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:02,830
O'Conner.

771
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:05,630
Let's go get some cars.

772
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:07,460
Nice.

773
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:48,630
Home sweet home.

774
01:05:06,650 --> 01:05:07,820
Or that.

775
01:05:08,570 --> 01:05:09,570
How about that?

776
01:05:09,650 --> 01:05:11,030
All motor, no tuning issues.

777
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:13,490
I always wanted one of those.

778
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:17,280
Held the record on the Avenida three years running.

779
01:05:17,990 --> 01:05:19,870
Damn, bro...

780
01:05:19,870 --> 01:05:22,500
You got a lot of balls to bring your problems here, Toretto.

781
01:05:22,830 --> 01:05:25,670
Not to mention a cop.

782
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:27,960
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

783
01:05:28,130 --> 01:05:31,050
Word on the street is a lot of people are looking for you two.

784
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:33,010
What?

785
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:35,050
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

786
01:05:36,470 --> 01:05:38,470
No, we're kind of counting on it.

787
01:05:38,850 --> 01:05:41,180
That little coupe may run the streets around here,

788
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:44,600
but that monster

789
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,690
has never seen a set of tail lights.

790
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,020
Ever.

791
01:05:48,150 --> 01:05:49,190
Well, she's about to.

792
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,110
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

793
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:57,530
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

794
01:05:59,030 --> 01:06:01,580
Let's go, legend.

795
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,040
Car for car.

796
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:06,870
Car for car?

797
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:08,920
You want it, come and get it.

798
01:06:13,550 --> 01:06:15,380
Let's see what they got.

799
01:06:21,850 --> 01:06:23,060
Really?

800
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:27,850
Where did you get that from? Papa Smurf?

801
01:06:28,020 --> 01:06:30,900
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.

802
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:54,920
How was that one?

803
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:56,050
Camera caught you.

804
01:06:56,420 --> 01:06:57,470
What?

805
01:06:57,590 --> 01:06:58,590
Yeah, it still caught you.

806
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,640
Man, I was milking the hell out of that thing, too.

807
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,220
We're going to need a faster car.

808
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:09,480
I want my money. Come on, man.

809
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:14,310
Yeah!

810
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:18,740
Let's get it! Watch this.

811
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:28,960
That's exactly why your ass ain't been driving.

812
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:42,140
I think I'm in love.

813
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,480
That was real solid work.

814
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:50,940
I think Camera 3 still caught you, though.

815
01:07:51,100 --> 01:07:52,310
Let's do it again.

816
01:07:59,820 --> 01:08:01,570
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

817
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,700
You're kidding me.

818
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:03,870
Yep.

819
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:08,500
Where in the hell did y'all get one of these?

820
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:10,960
Well, we had a life before you met us.

821
01:08:12,290 --> 01:08:15,500
All right, I'll get to work on the electronic tumbler

822
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:17,840
but there's still another problem.

823
01:08:18,510 --> 01:08:19,800
Palm scanner.

824
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,720
And without Reyes' handprint,

825
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:24,180
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

826
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,180
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

827
01:08:26,350 --> 01:08:28,020
You got $100 million in a safe.

828
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:29,890
You going to put somebody else's handprint on it?

829
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:33,060
Now there you go with that negativity, man.

830
01:08:33,060 --> 01:08:34,360
That shit is eating you alive.

831
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,980
- You check that. - Yo, check that. Shut up!

832
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,030
How are we supposed to get Reyes' handprint?

833
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:44,070
Han. You're up.

834
01:08:45,990 --> 01:08:49,500
Sure. Nothing like the easy stuff.

835
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,370
Let's go. I'll drive.

836
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:10,680
I make six bodyguards.

837
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:11,770
Seven.

838
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:15,860
You think that guy with a fanny pack is a tourist?

839
01:09:20,690 --> 01:09:23,240
So, how long were you in the army?

840
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:26,200
That gun you pulled the other day was a Jericho 941.

841
01:09:27,370 --> 01:09:29,200
Thumb-racking the slide?

842
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,910
That was straight-up MOSSAD.

843
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,290
I got out of the military

844
01:09:35,370 --> 01:09:38,420
probably the same time you quit smoking.

845
01:09:38,590 --> 01:09:40,800
The amount of chips you eat,

846
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,970
the way you always have to keep your hands and mouth busy,

847
01:09:44,130 --> 01:09:46,760
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

848
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:50,430
Unfiltered.

849
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,560
Well, this is a bust.

850
01:09:56,440 --> 01:09:59,770
We're not going to be able to get his fingerprints out here.

851
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:03,110
We need to do some more recon, call in a couple of extra guys.

852
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:04,570
Or

853
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:07,160
you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

854
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:08,300
We're going to figure this out, I promise you.

855
01:11:11,510 --> 01:11:12,810
What's up?

856
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,850
I thought you were more of a thong man.

857
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,350
We got the print.

858
01:11:18,770 --> 01:11:19,850
Where?

859
01:11:22,020 --> 01:11:24,030
Okay, that's crazy.

860
01:11:25,690 --> 01:11:28,320
So, did he just slap that ass

861
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,530
or did he grab and hold on to it?

862
01:11:32,990 --> 01:11:35,040
Hey, this will work.

863
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:36,750
I'm impressed.

864
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:37,870
Got it?

865
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,000
Got it.

866
01:11:39,080 --> 01:11:40,750
But you still didn't answer the question.

867
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:49,090
Oh, no. Guys, guys! Guys, we have a problem.

868
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:50,930
The whole team just got burnt.

869
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:54,850
Now we're all wanted.

870
01:11:56,930 --> 01:11:57,930
How did this happen?

871
01:11:58,180 --> 01:12:01,730
US Diplomatic Security Service issued the warrants.

872
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,610
Agent L. Hobbs.

873
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,070
Hold on one second.

874
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:07,190
Hey, Dom.

875
01:12:08,900 --> 01:12:10,610
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

876
01:12:13,450 --> 01:12:14,530
Yeah.

877
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:18,410
Hobbs is the leader of the elite task force for the DSS.

878
01:12:18,580 --> 01:12:19,710
So he's good.

879
01:12:19,870 --> 01:12:22,750
When the FBI wants to find somebody, that's who they call.

880
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,590
Because he never misses his mark.

881
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:27,630
This guy is Old Testament.

882
01:12:27,800 --> 01:12:31,050
Blood, bullets, wrath of God. That's his style.

883
01:12:31,220 --> 01:12:33,550
And right now he's hunting us?

884
01:12:33,720 --> 01:12:35,550
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

885
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:36,760
Yeah, but how?

886
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:40,270
This thing's already been difficult without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

887
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:42,810
If anything, we need more room to breathe.

888
01:12:44,980 --> 01:12:46,440
Roman's right.

889
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:51,650
Think we need to get some fresh air.

890
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:57,620
We've got a hit. '70s Charger.

891
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,790
Let's get a move on!

892
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,580
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

893
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,460
Move, move, move, move!

894
01:13:13,590 --> 01:13:15,180
It stopped about a block ahead.

895
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,300
Park it. We're going on foot.

896
01:13:40,490 --> 01:13:41,700
Hey, Toretto.

897
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,510
You're under arrest.

898
01:13:51,710 --> 01:13:52,880
Arrest?

899
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,010
I don't feel like I'm under arrest.

900
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,970
How about you, Brian?

901
01:13:58,140 --> 01:13:59,350
No, not a bit.

902
01:14:01,180 --> 01:14:02,350
Not even a little bit.

903
01:14:02,520 --> 01:14:04,850
Just give it a minute. It'll sink in.

904
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:10,650
We didn't kill those feds. That was Reyes.

905
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:12,070
I don't give a shit.

906
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,990
I'm just here to bring in two assholes whose names hit my desk.

907
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:18,530
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

908
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,000
That's funny.

909
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:26,250
From a guy who took the oath of a cop, then went against everything it stood for.

910
01:14:26,540 --> 01:14:28,000
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

911
01:14:28,170 --> 01:14:30,540
who beat a man half to death with a socket wrench.

912
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:32,420
Yeah, real tough.

913
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,680
You turn around and put your hands behind your back.

914
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:39,180
I don't think so.

915
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,010
Your mistake is thinking you got a goddamn choice, boy.

916
01:14:46,060 --> 01:14:47,730
And your mistake?

917
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:49,940
Thinking you're in America.

918
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:56,530
You're a long way from home.

919
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:01,530
This is Brazil.

920
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:18,930
Come on, boss. Another day.

921
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:23,220
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

922
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:30,480
I'll see you soon, Toretto.

923
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:34,650
I look forward to it, cop.

924
01:16:11,770 --> 01:16:12,900
Yep.

925
01:16:13,150 --> 01:16:14,360
Tracker's on.

926
01:16:15,650 --> 01:16:16,730
Got them.

927
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,390
I don't understand. Why come here?

928
01:17:26,050 --> 01:17:28,890
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

929
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:33,560
Because it's worth it.

930
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:38,900
You should run, you know.

931
01:17:39,610 --> 01:17:41,070
Hobbs will find you.

932
01:17:43,780 --> 01:17:45,490
You have every reason to leave.

933
01:17:45,570 --> 01:17:46,950
Why stay?

934
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:56,210
Why do you?

935
01:17:57,790 --> 01:18:00,050
My husband was a good police officer.

936
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:03,050
An honest man.

937
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:05,590
We both grew up here.

938
01:18:06,430 --> 01:18:08,800
Two years ago he was murdered in the street

939
01:18:08,970 --> 01:18:10,720
right outside our door.

940
01:18:13,060 --> 01:18:15,390
Reyes owns this favela now.

941
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,100
He gives things to people.

942
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:21,610
But everything has a price.

943
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:26,070
The people here need a new start.

944
01:18:26,450 --> 01:18:28,240
They need to be free.

945
01:18:37,830 --> 01:18:39,670
You didn't kill those men in the train,

946
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,960
did you?

947
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:48,970
Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you?

948
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:56,980
Hey!

949
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:02,270
Was she so special to you?

950
01:19:06,820 --> 01:19:09,320
I never thought anyone could understand how much.

951
01:19:12,490 --> 01:19:14,290
But you do.

952
01:19:37,220 --> 01:19:38,220
Yeah!

953
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:51,070
Close, but not enough.

954
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,740
Dom, the window is too small, man.

955
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:56,910
Only way we're going to beat the cameras is with invisible cars.

956
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:02,040
And I know just where to get them.

957
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,380
Let's take a ride, boys.

958
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:16,350
Don't hurt yourself.

959
01:20:34,950 --> 01:20:37,290
It's been a while since I've been behind the wheel of one of these.

960
01:20:37,580 --> 01:20:39,540
First time I've ever been in the front seat.

961
01:20:47,250 --> 01:20:48,800
Rome, what took you so long?

962
01:20:49,050 --> 01:20:52,890
I thought for sure you'd be showing up with some chrome spinners or something.

963
01:20:53,970 --> 01:20:55,180
Real funny.

964
01:20:56,390 --> 01:21:00,230
I got $100,000 that says I can take you all in the next quarter-mile.

965
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:01,940
Yeah, your broke ass has got a hundred grand.

966
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:04,400
If we pull off this job, I will.

967
01:21:04,650 --> 01:21:06,150
The next two lights.

968
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:07,610
Hundred thousand.

969
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:11,320
We don't pull this job off, we're probably dead anyway.

970
01:21:11,610 --> 01:21:13,950
Let's make it a million.

971
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,160
I like that. All right, a million-dollar quarter-mile.

972
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:19,790
All right, then.

973
01:21:19,950 --> 01:21:22,790
You only live once. Let's do it.

974
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:24,330
What do you say, Dom?

975
01:21:24,790 --> 01:21:26,460
We talking or we racing?

976
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:29,090
Just don't cheat this time.

977
01:21:29,630 --> 01:21:32,260
Got to let that go.

978
01:21:50,690 --> 01:21:52,150
Yeah!

979
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,410
Typical, Roman.

980
01:21:56,570 --> 01:21:58,990
I'm going to get this money. I'm hungry.

981
01:22:07,420 --> 01:22:09,000
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

982
01:22:11,800 --> 01:22:12,800
No!

983
01:22:14,090 --> 01:22:16,090
Not this time, Dom.

984
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,350
You got to want it, Brian.

985
01:22:50,540 --> 01:22:54,380
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

986
01:23:08,980 --> 01:23:10,480
Good race, O'Conner.

987
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:12,360
Thanks, Dom.

988
01:23:13,230 --> 01:23:15,900
Do you know how long I've been waiting for that shit?

989
01:23:16,070 --> 01:23:18,160
I told you he didn't see it.

990
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,990
Your man right there?

991
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,370
He let off the throttle at the line.

992
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:23,830
You didn't do nothing.

993
01:23:23,910 --> 01:23:25,250
He let you win.

994
01:23:26,250 --> 01:23:27,580
Bullshit.

995
01:23:49,270 --> 01:23:50,600
Vince, what are you doing?

996
01:23:50,730 --> 01:23:52,060
Quiet! They've been tracking you.

997
01:24:00,240 --> 01:24:01,620
I know she's here!

998
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:05,490
Find her!

999
01:24:05,660 --> 01:24:07,250
Go! Go! Go!

1000
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,140
It's okay. Wait!

1001
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:26,350
Reyes' guys were waiting for me at the market.

1002
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:28,980
Vince saved my life.

1003
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:35,820
DOM: You hungry?

1004
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:39,990
Yeah, sure.

1005
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,490
Good.

1006
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:44,490
Because you're saying grace.

1007
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:49,040
Thanks, Vince.

1008
01:24:55,630 --> 01:24:56,670
Yo, you burned it!

1009
01:24:56,840 --> 01:25:00,220
Yo, this is how my momma does it. Relax.

1010
01:25:00,380 --> 01:25:02,680
Yeah, but your mom is the worst cook in the world.

1011
01:25:02,840 --> 01:25:05,680
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

1012
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,140
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

1013
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,480
To you, bro. Cheers, cheers, cheers.

1014
01:25:12,640 --> 01:25:14,810
So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

1015
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:15,940
Yeah.

1016
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:19,480
So, you got a little more than $10 or $11 million coming.

1017
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:20,820
What you going to do with your money?

1018
01:25:20,900 --> 01:25:21,950
Me?

1019
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:22,990
Yeah.

1020
01:25:23,070 --> 01:25:25,870
Actually, man, I been thinking about opening up a garage back home.

1021
01:25:26,370 --> 01:25:29,330
Place where people can bring their cars and not get completely ripped off.

1022
01:25:29,490 --> 01:25:30,540
You know what I mean?

1023
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:31,910
- Really? - Yeah.

1024
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:35,040
So, your dream is to start a day job?

1025
01:25:35,210 --> 01:25:37,170
That's stupid. Like, why would...

1026
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,380
No, it's not stupid at all. I love what I do.

1027
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:40,880
That don't make no sense to me.

1028
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:43,720
I know what I'm going to do with my money.

1029
01:25:45,890 --> 01:25:47,850
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

1030
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:49,720
See? See?

1031
01:25:49,890 --> 01:25:51,890
There you go with that negativity, man.

1032
01:25:52,060 --> 01:25:54,230
You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

1033
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:56,860
It's going to take a little more than money to learn how to cook.

1034
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,230
That's horrible.

1035
01:25:58,610 --> 01:26:02,400
But I heard they was looking for a chef down at this animal shelter.

1036
01:26:02,570 --> 01:26:03,570
You might want to...

1037
01:26:03,740 --> 01:26:05,410
I know the manager.

1038
01:26:10,870 --> 01:26:12,540
Hey, Dom.

1039
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,460
Listen.

1040
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:20,920
I know that you're all set for this job tomorrow,

1041
01:26:21,090 --> 01:26:22,920
but if you need an extra man, I could...

1042
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:24,420
You're in.

1043
01:26:32,720 --> 01:26:34,480
There's always room for family.

1044
01:26:40,690 --> 01:26:41,900
Thank you.

1045
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:47,740
Get something to eat.

1046
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:50,910
Yeah.

1047
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,750
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

1048
01:26:58,290 --> 01:27:00,460
She might be right.

1049
01:27:04,800 --> 01:27:07,300
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

1050
01:27:07,470 --> 01:27:10,010
When your life is on the line

1051
01:27:10,180 --> 01:27:11,970
that's when you learn about yourself.

1052
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,690
That's a fair deal.

1053
01:27:21,690 --> 01:27:23,230
We're less than 24 hours

1054
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:25,990
from the biggest celebration of our life.

1055
01:27:26,150 --> 01:27:28,320
Y'all need a refill. This is serious stuff.

1056
01:27:28,490 --> 01:27:29,700
- No, I'm good. - Cheers, baby.

1057
01:27:29,860 --> 01:27:31,490
I'm good. No, thank you.

1058
01:27:31,660 --> 01:27:32,660
No, she can't.

1059
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:35,500
What do you mean?

1060
01:27:35,580 --> 01:27:36,710
She can't.

1061
01:27:36,870 --> 01:27:38,210
What do you mean she can't?

1062
01:27:38,370 --> 01:27:39,500
What is...

1063
01:27:43,840 --> 01:27:45,840
Are you serious right now?

1064
01:27:46,340 --> 01:27:49,680
Is that the reason you let him beat you in the quarter-mile?

1065
01:27:51,390 --> 01:27:52,510
That was a baby gift.

1066
01:27:52,680 --> 01:27:54,510
No, that's messed up.

1067
01:27:54,680 --> 01:27:56,220
No, you're not taking that from me.

1068
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:58,060
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

1069
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:00,480
So, did he just smack the ass

1070
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,480
or did he grab and hold on to it?

1071
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:03,690
Which one was it?

1072
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,150
Congratulations.

1073
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:06,280
Thank you.

1074
01:28:06,360 --> 01:28:07,650
How can you keep this a secret?

1075
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:08,950
Crazy, huh?

1076
01:28:09,030 --> 01:28:10,360
It's your boy.

1077
01:28:10,530 --> 01:28:13,910
Why would you keep something like that away from me?

1078
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,870
Baby gift, huh?

1079
01:28:16,410 --> 01:28:19,000
I have no idea what they're talking about. Oh?

1080
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:21,710
What happened to the pull-out method, man?

1081
01:28:23,540 --> 01:28:25,590
Toast. Toast.

1082
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:36,890
Money will come and go. We know that.

1083
01:28:37,850 --> 01:28:41,600
But the most important thing in life will always be the people in this room.

1084
01:28:42,770 --> 01:28:44,400
Right here.

1085
01:28:46,690 --> 01:28:48,070
Right now.

1086
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:03,920
I'm all set.

1087
01:29:04,920 --> 01:29:07,920
Yo, Santos. Van good?

1088
01:29:09,210 --> 01:29:11,420
You know we're always good, bro.

1089
01:29:15,140 --> 01:29:17,720
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

1090
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:20,430
We're not going to get a better window.

1091
01:29:20,600 --> 01:29:22,770
Okay, guys, it's show time!

1092
01:29:22,940 --> 01:29:24,600
First team in position, let's go.

1093
01:29:24,770 --> 01:29:26,060
Come on, let's do this.

1094
01:29:38,280 --> 01:29:39,290
Hey, Dom.

1095
01:29:40,950 --> 01:29:42,410
I got eyes on Mia.

1096
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:50,670
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

1097
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:52,800
And what do they all have in common?

1098
01:29:52,970 --> 01:29:54,090
No extradition.

1099
01:29:55,970 --> 01:29:58,510
We're one hour away from the rest of our lives.

1100
01:29:58,680 --> 01:29:59,970
Yeah.

1101
01:30:01,850 --> 01:30:02,980
Cops!

1102
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:06,900
Come on. Go.

1103
01:30:18,370 --> 01:30:20,200
You just made a big mistake.

1104
01:30:21,450 --> 01:30:23,660
Took me a while to find that tracking chip.

1105
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:25,370
But not as long to flip the receiver.

1106
01:30:25,540 --> 01:30:27,040
You're going down, Toretto.

1107
01:30:27,210 --> 01:30:29,210
I'm right here.

1108
01:32:01,040 --> 01:32:01,680
Dom!

1109
01:32:01,760 --> 01:32:03,140
Stand back. I got this.

1110
01:32:11,710 --> 01:32:12,710
Pull off!

1111
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:15,630
- Dom! - Please, stop!

1112
01:32:21,260 --> 01:32:22,260
Dom!

1113
01:32:31,440 --> 01:32:32,440
Dom!

1114
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,340
Yeah.

1115
01:33:37,550 --> 01:33:39,510
We're coming in now.

1116
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:44,010
Have the marshals meet us at the airport when we land.

1117
01:33:51,810 --> 01:33:53,190
Ambush!

1118
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:14,040
Wilkes, suppression fire. Shut them down.

1119
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:19,920
Stagger-step. Cover me.

1120
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,010
Watch them!

1121
01:34:37,570 --> 01:34:38,570
Cut us loose!

1122
01:34:38,730 --> 01:34:40,740
Come on! Cut us loose!

1123
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,170
- We're good? - Yeah, let's go, let's go!

1124
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,020
Hey, Dom.

1125
01:37:31,070 --> 01:37:33,490
You've got to meet my son.

1126
01:37:33,660 --> 01:37:35,660
Nico.

1127
01:37:40,120 --> 01:37:41,790
I will.

1128
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:45,960
He's a good kid.

1129
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:52,470
You know, we named him after you.

1130
01:37:54,010 --> 01:37:55,340
"Dominic."

1131
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,560
You've got my word, Vince.

1132
01:38:11,110 --> 01:38:13,200
You were always my brother.

1133
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:25,370
I got eyes on Nico now.

1134
01:38:36,050 --> 01:38:38,550
We need to move. We don't have that much time.

1135
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:39,810
I got us a flight out.

1136
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:42,430
We can leave Rio in the rearview in the next five hours.

1137
01:38:42,600 --> 01:38:44,390
Not to run away.

1138
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,400
To finish the job.

1139
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:50,730
Are you crazy, Dom? We can't.

1140
01:38:51,070 --> 01:38:52,900
It's a suicide mission.

1141
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:55,650
That's your man over there on the table.

1142
01:38:56,950 --> 01:38:58,870
The plan is busted!

1143
01:38:59,030 --> 01:39:01,790
This is bullshit, man. Reyes knows we're coming!

1144
01:39:01,950 --> 01:39:03,120
He's right.

1145
01:39:03,290 --> 01:39:06,210
They tripled the detail at the police station.

1146
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:08,630
It's going to be a wall of gunfire.

1147
01:39:11,000 --> 01:39:13,300
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

1148
01:39:13,460 --> 01:39:14,630
It's a trap, man.

1149
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:16,380
You know that.

1150
01:39:16,550 --> 01:39:19,390
Dom, listen to them.

1151
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:21,560
Run, before it's too late.

1152
01:39:21,640 --> 01:39:22,720
Leave Rio.

1153
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,180
You can be free.

1154
01:39:26,980 --> 01:39:28,980
Running ain't freedom.

1155
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:32,190
You should know that.

1156
01:39:36,900 --> 01:39:39,660
You know you're all free to make your own choices.

1157
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:45,040
I'm in.

1158
01:39:54,130 --> 01:39:56,010
I'll ride with you, Toretto.

1159
01:39:59,010 --> 01:40:01,800
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

1160
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,900
So what's the plan, Dom?

1161
01:40:12,400 --> 01:40:14,780
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

1162
01:40:15,940 --> 01:40:17,900
We don't sneak.

1163
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:21,950
The only thing he cares about is his money.

1164
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:24,280
We pull that,

1165
01:40:24,450 --> 01:40:26,500
we pull him.

1166
01:40:42,930 --> 01:40:44,530
See?

1167
01:40:45,720 --> 01:40:48,350
I called in every cop on our payroll.

1168
01:40:49,850 --> 01:40:51,650
We're covered.

1169
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,690
We've got every entrance covered with weapons teams.

1170
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:57,730
God Himself couldn't get at your money if He wanted to.

1171
01:40:58,110 --> 01:41:02,450
God isn't my worry.

1172
01:41:12,210 --> 01:41:13,250
You ready?

1173
01:41:15,420 --> 01:41:16,550
I'm ready.

1174
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:15,940
What's happening?

1175
01:42:16,060 --> 01:42:17,360
They're taking the vault!

1176
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:18,440
What?

1177
01:42:18,520 --> 01:42:19,520
The vault!

1178
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:32,120
Follow me! Quickly!

1179
01:42:36,460 --> 01:42:37,960
Let me through!

1180
01:42:47,890 --> 01:42:48,970
Don't move!

1181
01:42:50,180 --> 01:42:51,560
Stay down.

1182
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:22,840
Call it out, Mia!

1183
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,550
You've got a straight shot for two blocks.

1184
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:26,800
Go right.

1185
01:43:26,880 --> 01:43:27,880
Got it.

1186
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:52,120
Well, the plan is working.

1187
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:54,660
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio on your tail.

1188
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,250
You have to move fast.

1189
01:43:56,540 --> 01:43:57,710
What's the best route?

1190
01:43:57,870 --> 01:44:00,630
Okay, keep going straight another half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

1191
01:44:01,040 --> 01:44:03,050
and then go left.

1192
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:07,720
That ain't going to work.

1193
01:44:09,800 --> 01:44:11,470
Spikes ahead, Dom. We got spikes!

1194
01:44:11,640 --> 01:44:13,470
We're going right!

1195
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:16,060
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

1196
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,640
We've got no choice. Now!

1197
01:44:37,290 --> 01:44:38,460
Shit!

1198
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:46,300
Holy shit!

1199
01:44:46,460 --> 01:44:47,630
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.

1200
01:44:47,760 --> 01:44:49,420
Did you just take out a bank?

1201
01:44:58,390 --> 01:44:59,430
Two inbound!

1202
01:45:01,690 --> 01:45:02,980
All right, there's an alley coming up on your left.

1203
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:04,150
Yeah, I got it.

1204
01:45:58,410 --> 01:46:00,040
You little bastard!

1205
01:46:23,190 --> 01:46:25,900
All right, good job, Dom. Right-hander, right here, right-hander.

1206
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:34,700
Guys, there's a big group coming at you from the south.

1207
01:46:34,860 --> 01:46:36,280
You have to do something now!

1208
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,200
Hey, go wide.

1209
01:47:12,960 --> 01:47:13,960
Yeah!

1210
01:48:27,770 --> 01:48:29,100
You're all clear on the left.

1211
01:48:29,270 --> 01:48:31,100
Good afternoon, officer!

1212
01:48:32,980 --> 01:48:35,360
License and registration, please!

1213
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:44,370
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!

1214
01:48:44,530 --> 01:48:46,040
We're clear on the right.

1215
01:48:46,200 --> 01:48:47,330
Oh, man.

1216
01:48:54,130 --> 01:48:55,210
Thanks guys.

1217
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:56,630
Any time.

1218
01:48:56,710 --> 01:48:58,170
I'll see you on the other side.

1219
01:48:58,340 --> 01:49:00,840
You guys just carved out a 10-second window.

1220
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:02,470
Make it count!

1221
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:11,040
Zizi, stay on them.

1222
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:39,420
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

1223
01:49:41,130 --> 01:49:42,220
Shit.

1224
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:50,730
They have no way out.

1225
01:49:52,640 --> 01:49:53,690
No!

1226
01:49:54,520 --> 01:49:55,520
There's too many of them.

1227
01:49:55,690 --> 01:49:57,730
Hey, there's too many of them. We're not going to make it.

1228
01:50:01,400 --> 01:50:02,450
You're right, we aren't.

1229
01:50:03,530 --> 01:50:04,700
You are.

1230
01:50:04,860 --> 01:50:06,070
What are you talking about?

1231
01:50:06,240 --> 01:50:08,580
Just let the vault go. Get out of there.

1232
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:10,290
You're a father now, Brian.

1233
01:50:10,450 --> 01:50:12,620
No, I'm not leaving you. Now you stick with the plan!

1234
01:50:13,370 --> 01:50:14,750
It was always the plan.

1235
01:50:15,460 --> 01:50:16,710
Take care of Mia.

1236
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,250
Dom, you listen to me now. Okay?

1237
01:50:19,420 --> 01:50:21,300
You cut loose right now.

1238
01:50:37,730 --> 01:50:39,670
Hey, what is he doing?

1239
01:50:43,610 --> 01:50:44,740
We've got him!

1240
01:51:01,590 --> 01:51:02,800
Close down the bridge!

1241
01:51:37,040 --> 01:51:38,460
Do something, asshole!

1242
01:51:50,510 --> 01:51:51,680
Kill him, dammit!

1243
01:52:03,020 --> 01:52:04,530
Kill him now!

1244
01:53:16,140 --> 01:53:18,980
I thought I told you to go on.

1245
01:53:20,810 --> 01:53:23,060
Yeah, I had to make a call.

1246
01:53:40,620 --> 01:53:42,080
Help me.

1247
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:46,460
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

1248
01:53:50,630 --> 01:53:52,470
It's a hell of a mess.

1249
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:54,470
Yeah, it is.

1250
01:53:56,140 --> 01:53:58,010
You know I can't let you two go.

1251
01:53:58,310 --> 01:54:00,140
I ain't made that way.

1252
01:54:02,350 --> 01:54:05,520
The way I see it, you've earned yourselves 24 hours.

1253
01:54:06,610 --> 01:54:07,650
The money stays, though.

1254
01:54:08,900 --> 01:54:10,650
If I were you, I'd use the time.

1255
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:14,200
Make peace with whatever demons you got left.

1256
01:54:18,790 --> 01:54:20,660
Because come tomorrow,

1257
01:54:22,160 --> 01:54:23,460
I will find you.

1258
01:54:35,130 --> 01:54:36,510
Toretto!

1259
01:54:37,180 --> 01:54:38,680
I'll see you soon.

1260
01:54:41,470 --> 01:54:43,350
No, you won't.

1261
01:55:24,850 --> 01:55:25,940
Thanks, guys.

1262
01:55:26,100 --> 01:55:27,560
I'll see you on the other side.

1263
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:34,740
You guys just carved out a 10 second window.

1264
01:55:34,900 --> 01:55:36,110
Make it count!

1265
01:56:18,610 --> 01:56:20,320
Come on, baby.

1266
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:22,280
Don't be mean.

1267
01:56:24,540 --> 01:56:25,540
Come on.

1268
01:57:37,230 --> 01:57:40,900
"For Rosa and Nico. See you soon, - Uncle Dom"

1269
01:57:47,620 --> 01:57:51,160
MONACO

1270
01:57:53,000 --> 01:57:54,810
You sure about this?

1271
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,170
You know I am.

1272
01:58:00,050 --> 01:58:01,630
You don't need to do this.

1273
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:04,800
Just leave me alone.

1274
01:58:04,970 --> 01:58:07,010
Bro, I'm not trying to be negative,

1275
01:58:07,180 --> 01:58:09,890
but casinos are the kinds of places designed to take money from guys like you and me.

1276
01:58:10,060 --> 01:58:11,230
When I win here

1277
01:58:11,310 --> 01:58:13,730
I'm buying you a lifetime supply of antidepressants.

1278
01:58:14,020 --> 01:58:16,980
You don't put ten million on red!

1279
01:58:17,060 --> 01:58:18,070
Enough already.

1280
01:58:18,150 --> 01:58:19,570
You put it on black.

1281
01:58:21,240 --> 01:58:23,210
No more bets.

1282
01:58:48,930 --> 01:58:51,140
Right this way, my dear.

1283
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:55,350
You stay right here, I'll be right back.

1284
01:58:57,190 --> 01:58:59,110
So, this is your dream, huh?

1285
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:00,650
It's enough for me, man.

1286
01:59:00,820 --> 01:59:01,940
I take it that's your dream.

1287
01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:03,650
Absolutely. What up, boy?

1288
01:59:03,740 --> 01:59:04,780
What's going on?

1289
01:59:04,860 --> 01:59:05,860
You good?

1290
01:59:05,950 --> 01:59:06,910
Yes, yes.

1291
01:59:06,990 --> 01:59:08,030
You know what's crazy?

1292
01:59:08,120 --> 01:59:10,830
There's only four of those cars in the whole world.

1293
01:59:10,990 --> 01:59:13,790
Yeah, I got the only one in the Western Hemisphere.

1294
01:59:13,960 --> 01:59:15,960
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi

1295
01:59:16,040 --> 01:59:18,250
an offer he could not refuse.

1296
01:59:19,130 --> 01:59:21,000
Huh. That's a nice lady you got there, too.

1297
01:59:21,170 --> 01:59:22,510
Absolutely.

1298
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:24,470
What's happening?

1299
01:59:25,090 --> 01:59:27,430
We got to go, man. Let's do this.

1300
01:59:27,590 --> 01:59:29,300
Okay, I'll drive.

1301
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:31,720
In that? Come on, man, no way.

1302
01:59:31,810 --> 01:59:34,230
No, no. Not in this.

1303
01:59:34,390 --> 01:59:35,640
In that.

1304
01:59:41,820 --> 01:59:43,530
Are you serious right now?

1305
01:59:43,990 --> 01:59:45,530
Man, this is crazy!

1306
01:59:46,150 --> 01:59:50,320
Yes, I guess that means there are two in the Western Hemisphere, huh?

1307
01:59:50,990 --> 01:59:53,540
What's your smart ass got to say now?

1308
01:59:53,870 --> 01:59:54,870
You know what?

1309
01:59:55,040 --> 01:59:57,080
We can always shine together, baby.

1310
01:59:57,250 --> 02:00:00,000
Get dressed, man, we got things to do!

1311
02:00:12,180 --> 02:00:13,560
So, where to now?

1312
02:00:13,720 --> 02:00:15,180
I don't know.

1313
02:00:15,350 --> 02:00:17,690
Never been to Madrid.

1314
02:00:17,850 --> 02:00:20,520
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

1315
02:00:20,690 --> 02:00:22,610
We'll get there.

1316
02:00:22,860 --> 02:00:24,780
Eventually.

1317
02:01:13,120 --> 02:01:15,490
Oh My...

1318
02:01:23,920 --> 02:01:25,750
Nice surprise.

1319
02:01:29,300 --> 02:01:30,470
Crazy, right?

1320
02:01:39,100 --> 02:01:42,440
This is the happiest I've ever seen my sister.

1321
02:01:43,190 --> 02:01:45,440
It's because we're free.

1322
02:01:58,620 --> 02:02:00,960
You know, I want another shot.

1323
02:02:04,420 --> 02:02:05,630
Yeah?

1324
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:09,130
Yeah.

1325
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:11,010
No wagers, nobody else.
