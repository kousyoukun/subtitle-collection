1
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:36,890
Dominic Toretto,

2
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:42,180
you are hereby sentenced to serve 25 years to life,

3
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,760
at the Lompoc Maximum Security Prison System,

4
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,060
without the possibility of early parole.

5
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:08,070
This is all the aftermath of a daring daylight breakout.

6
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,100
There were 26 high risk inmates.

7
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:12,590
Everyone on board has been accounted for

8
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,720
except for one - Dominic Toretto.

9
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,040
Police believe the identity of man

10
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:18,920
they believe had orchestrated the shocking escape has amazingly

11
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,800
resulted in no fatality this afternoon.

12
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:24,250
He is former federal agent Brian O'Conner.

13
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,890
Appears to be a manhunt underway for three fugitives tonight.

14
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,170
Multiple federal and local agencies have joined forces

15
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,560
in the search for - Dominic Toretto

16
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,910
and his accomplishes Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto.

17
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,790
Despite every eye in the country looking for them,

18
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,190
where Toretto and O'Conner are now is any ones guess.

19
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,550
It's gonna be here, all right.

20
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,050
Let's get out of here.

21
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:33,730
Mia.

22
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,490
Buster.

23
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,360
Come on.

24
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:46,580
Dom here yet?

25
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,740
- No. - When was the last time you heard from him?

26
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,550
A couple of weeks ago, up in Ecuador or somewhere.

27
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,680
- How does it feel ? - What's that?

28
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:01,690
Beyond the other side of a wanted person.

29
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,660
- Nice long. - Yes.

30
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,340
Why Rio, Vince?

31
00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:01,450
You mean after you everything screwed up in LA?

32
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,600
Ended up free-fall into South America,

33
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,170
hit every hellhole on the way down.

34
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:13,860
We kept on going if not for Rosa.

35
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,260
So, listen.

36
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,440
There is a job coming up.

37
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:52,650
I was hoping Dom was gonna be here by now, but...

38
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,950
This one's clean enough, we can do it without him.

39
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,100
It's a big gig.

40
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:01,380
Couple of high end cars, easy targets.

41
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,080
All that is putting together a team to swipe them.

42
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,190
Just need a few more willing bodies.

43
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,540
But, I don't know.

44
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,180
Look, the way the car seem is down here,

45
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:14,590
we can unload them quick and get top dollar.

46
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,570
It's easy money.

47
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,500
From where I am seeing,

48
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,930
it looks like you both could use a pay day.

49
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:05,080
What are you reading?

50
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,670
- Tour guide. - Yeah?

51
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,980
Tokyo.

52
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,560
You know what all of these places have in common.

53
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,370
Extradition.

54
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,290
Here we go.

55
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,460
Excuse me, boy.

56
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:41,450
Yeah, we have found them.

57
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,800
Yeah, second through last racer.

58
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,870
What, what is it?

59
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:58,710
DEA tags, this car is en-seized.

60
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,100
Look, who showed up.

61
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,650
Oh! god, I am so happy you are OK.

62
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,530
I thought I told you to lay low.

63
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:51,890
We were running out of fuel.

64
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,710
Had to make a call.

65
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:57,070
Hey, quit talking, we only got a two-minute window.

66
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,800
Let's go, Vince.

67
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,310
Ladies first.

68
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,690
See you baby.

69
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:20,310
Change of plans, wait for my call.

70
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:25,090
Let her go.

71
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,150
Where is she going?

72
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,270
Where is she going?

73
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,920
We are being robbed, go and pull over the train.

74
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,340
Access card, get the access card.

75
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,850
Dom, there is a bridge.

76
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,550
First is clear.

77
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,480
We are going to next.

78
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:38,980
Freeze.

79
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,660
We had to make a call, huh.

80
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,870
Shitty call, O'Conner.

81
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,710
Shitty call.

82
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,750
You two started quite a bit of trouble today.

83
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,060
Three of my men dead.

84
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,850
Three DEA agents, along with.

85
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,200
Of course, this is business.

86
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,440
Sometimes things go stray.

87
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,390
All I care about is the car.

88
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,760
Tell me where it is.

89
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,820
And I will let you go.

90
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,780
Three boxes are full of shit.

91
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,200
I do not know how you guys do business in your part of the world.

92
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,570
But here in Rio...

93
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,100
I like all parties to know what they are up against.

94
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,780
That's funny, because it goes both ways.

95
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,990
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

96
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,510
Wherever she hides, I will find her.

97
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,380
Mia?

98
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:43,960
Hey.

99
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,160
- You ok? - Yeah, you all right?

100
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,730
Just like a Toretto.

101
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,380
Where's Vince?

102
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:08,900
That's a good question.

103
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,320
He'll be here.

104
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,980
Guys, we are all over the news,

105
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:13,860
they are blaming us

106
00:20:13,970 --> 00:20:16,390
for killing of those DEA agents on the train.

107
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,300
Which means we just jump to the top of the wanted list.

108
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:22,190
The Feds will get us anywhere, their agents are off the limits.

109
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,050
They are gonna send their best guys,

110
00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:25,430
we gotta get out of here.

111
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,290
One thing we know for sure

112
00:20:30,050 --> 00:20:32,130
is that they wanted this car.

113
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,820
- Something's in it. - We find out what it is.

114
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,060
We know what we are up against.

115
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:58,320
Alright, listen up. The men we're after are professional runners.

116
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,100
They like speed and guarantee to go down the hardest possible way.

117
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,760
So make sure you got a lot of firearm.

118
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:03,590
We find them,

119
00:21:03,710 --> 00:21:05,800
we take them as a team and we bring them back.

120
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:09,780
And above all else, we never ever let them get into cars.

121
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,180
Let's go hunt.

122
00:21:16,550 --> 00:21:19,700
Agent Hobbs? I'm chief of police.

123
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,610
Sorry to hear for loss of your men.

124
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,000
Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

125
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,680
Let me tell you little something about these two men.

126
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,200
One's a former Federal officer, been in deep cover for 5 years,

127
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,580
knows everyway we are gonna come from.

128
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,900
The other one's a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

129
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,990
spent half his life on run avoiding folks like you.

130
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,780
Well, if there's anything we can do to help...

131
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,420
Two things.

132
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,860
One I need a translator.

133
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,780
Alright, We have plenty...

134
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:48,420
- Elena Neves. - A patrol officer?

135
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,580
You heard me.

136
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:52,010
But why? We have many more experienced people.

137
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,410
I like her smile.

138
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,850
What's the second thing?

139
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,840
Stay the fuck out of my way!

140
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,060
Brian.

141
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,150
There is something I have to tell you.

142
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,300
Oh, damn.

143
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,500
What a mess.

144
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:21,550
Where you have been, Vin?

145
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,790
You better check that tone.

146
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,730
You better answer some goddam questions.

147
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,430
Stop it, both of you.

148
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,950
Where were you, Vince?

149
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,820
Guys all over the favelas are asking questions about you.

150
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,300
Couldn't get out of there without leading them straight to you.

151
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:43,000
Had to wait them out.

152
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:45,760
That is such a horse shit, that was your job.

153
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,600
Enough O'Conner!

154
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,290
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

155
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:51,600
Go walk it off.

156
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:09,900
Look, I would love to expand my operations in your country.

157
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,580
But quite frankly.

158
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,310
No business methods are to find.

159
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,650
Let me tell you a true story.

160
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:18,950
500 years ago,

161
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,020
Portuguese and Spanish came to here.

162
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,430
Each trying to get the country from their natives.

163
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,810
The Spanish arrived guns blazing,

164
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,440
determined to prove who is boss.

165
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,870
But, the natives killed every single spaniard.

166
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,820
Personally, I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

167
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,950
They came bearing gifts.

168
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,090
Mirrors, scissors, blankets,

169
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:52,970
things that the native couldn't get on their own.

170
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,970
But, to continue receiving them would require will of Portuguese.

171
00:23:58,830 --> 00:24:00,990
And that's why all Brazilians speaks Portuguese today.

172
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,800
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

173
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,140
they will eventually fight back.

174
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:10,580
Because, they have nothing to lose.

175
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:12,890
And, that's the key

176
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:17,480
I go into the favelas, and give them something to lose.

177
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:21,960
Electricity, running water, school room for their kids.

178
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:26,040
And for that taste of the better life,

179
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:29,410
I own them.

180
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,840
Gentlemen.

181
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:47,030
Pardon me gentlemen.

182
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,970
I almost wish I didn't see it.

183
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,530
Almost.

184
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,500
Wait, Dom.

185
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,540
Mia was on that train.

186
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,960
I didn't...I didn't know.

187
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,930
I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

188
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,170
You set off the deal.

189
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,980
I thought the job was for the cars.

190
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:28,590
I did not know. All they wanted was the chip.

191
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,610
Damn.

192
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,420
You should have come clean.

193
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,670
What's going on out here?

194
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:39,060
- Nothing. - Please, Dom.

195
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,440
Just, let me have the chip.

196
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,950
I can take this to them and set things right.

197
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,350
Get out!

198
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:50,210
What?

199
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,030
Get out!

200
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,270
You never listened to me.

201
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:05,880
Not when I told you he was a cop and not now.

202
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,610
You never trusted me.

203
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:10,690
Now, look where it's gotten us.

204
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:15,160
Look at our family now, I can't go home.

205
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,720
Your sister is stuck in this life

206
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,660
and where is Letty, Dom?

207
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:23,890
Where's letty?

208
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,930
Plasma cover.

209
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,230
Wilkes, I want a list of every place

210
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:55,280
within 50 miles that distribute compressed gas tank.

211
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,430
Pass me that evidence bag.

212
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,980
Officer Neves, I have been waiting for you.

213
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,170
- You asked for me? - I did.

214
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,740
May I ask, why?

215
00:27:10,950 --> 00:27:12,720
My smile is not that great.

216
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,480
Your husband was an officer, who was gunned down in favela.

217
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,990
Six months later you up and join the force?

218
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:22,210
You are motivated.

219
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,690
Plus I procure the only one that real can't be brought.

220
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:27,330
Am I right?

221
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:30,270
- Yes. - Of course I am.

222
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,860
We have got some bad news.

223
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,560
You don't like my deserve first.

224
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,720
I checked the rail-line like you asked,

225
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,150
found a couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

226
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,980
One set of tracks headed west,

227
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:42,270
until it hit the main highway and then disappeared.

228
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,960
And the another set of tracks headed east,

229
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:46,230
170 inch wheel base, half inch track.

230
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,840
The GT40? That was missing from the manifest.

231
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,800
For the track a couple of miles, pretty easy on the scrub.

232
00:27:52,370 --> 00:27:53,910
Can't move without leaving signs.

233
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,350
Give me the damn badges.

234
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,830
The ground rolls into a hard pack and we lost the track too.

235
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,480
Not necessarily.

236
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:04,700
That road hits through hill into the favelas.

237
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:07,320
Couple of years ago it was washed out by a storm.

238
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,890
So is dirt from a mile from where you were.

239
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:12,540
If you headed that way, you will pickup the tracks there.

240
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,210
Come prepared?

241
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,730
I'm motivated.

242
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,520
All right then, let's find ourselves a car.

243
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,340
What do you think?

244
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,950
It's definitely not just a chip.

245
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,500
Look at all these side menus here, for data entry.

246
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:00,690
Let's check this one.

247
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:09,580
Look at that. Same building, same order every week.

248
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,530
It's a delivery schedule.

249
00:29:33,390 --> 00:29:34,780
What's this?

250
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:38,480
- Drugs? - No, that's a dealer pack.

251
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,190
See, the most major player they weigh their money,

252
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:43,070
so they don't have to cost somebody to account it.

253
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,400
Right there that's 49 kilos. 49 kilos is a million in twenties.

254
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,750
So, you are saying each one of these shipment

255
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,590
is worth 10 million dollars.

256
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:52,360
Yeah.

257
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,350
I thought so.

258
00:30:18,670 --> 00:30:22,350
So, what is that? A 100 million plus in cash oasis?

259
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,570
That how it keeps it off the grid.

260
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,810
I can say this one is razor smart about this pack.

261
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,910
I mean its whole network right there, just laid out on its inn.

262
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,210
Wilkes and Tom go from the middle, rest flank north.

263
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,930
What about me?

264
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,520
Stay here.

265
00:32:56,420 --> 00:32:59,100
Police! Get on the ground!

266
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,260
I got Torreto.

267
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:07,410
Hey! Police!

268
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:09,360
They already know who you are.

269
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,380
Let's go.

270
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:31,090
- You ok here? - Yeah.

271
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,990
Almost, thank you.

272
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,240
They are gonna be looking for the three of us together now.

273
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,160
We need to split up.

274
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,070
You and Mia head south, I will lead them away.

275
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,220
- No. - Dom's right.

276
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:22,420
We got lucky to get away, but what happens next time?

277
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,580
We have no choice but to split up.

278
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,530
I am pregnant.

279
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,920
I already lost my family once.

280
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,610
I am not gonna do that again.

281
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,690
- Are you kidding me? - No.

282
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,200
I'm not going anywhere. Ok?

283
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,640
Dom, promise me we stick together.

284
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,930
I promise.

285
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,880
Family just got bigger.

286
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,030
Something doesn't add up.

287
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,980
Toretto and O'Conner.

288
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,360
They stay when they are supposed to run.

289
00:36:33,470 --> 00:36:36,420
They steal gas and then give it away?

290
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,030
And now they killed three Federal agents?

291
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:40,590
It doesn't make any sense.

292
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,100
Here's what makes sense.

293
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,080
All these guys names are on a list.

294
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,560
They come up, we take'em down.

295
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,290
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

296
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,000
Wilkes! We get anything?

297
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:58,530
Standard forensics, shoe prints, hair fiber.

298
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,760
Prints are all over the car.

299
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,840
Anything else?

300
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,750
Yeah, we track the owner off the vehicle ID.

301
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,840
They are couple of shell companies in between

302
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:09,920
a electricity corporation owned by a investor named Hernan Reyes.

303
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,020
Investor?

304
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:14,630
If there is anything illegal happening in Rio,

305
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:15,950
Reyes is involved.

306
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,430
Okay, then so are we.

307
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:18,960
If you can send a clothes to that guy

308
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,750
I want every thing on him.

309
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,310
Chato, be on the roof.

310
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,480
I want you on watch in case somebody comes back for something.

311
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:25,830
Mac give me a cross-check on Reyes, full specs.

312
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,590
He goes to the John, I want to know how many times he shakes it.

313
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,960
- You got it boss. - Let's go.

314
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,370
Let's put all this mess together.

315
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:37,320
Well, that's gonna take a while.

316
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,890
Then you better get started.

317
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,780
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

318
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:42,840
Let's put it back together and find out what's missing.

319
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,220
Hey Dom, what do you remember about your father?

320
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,450
My father...

321
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:24,350
He used to....

322
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:27,550
he used to have a barbeque every sunday after church.

323
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,520
For everybody in the neighbourhood.

324
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:34,620
If we didn't go to church we didn't get any barbeque.

325
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,410
Every single day he was in the shop.

326
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,970
And, every single night he was at the kitchen table

327
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:45,280
with Mia helping her with her homework.

328
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:51,540
Even after she went to sleep he would stay up for few more hours.

329
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,340
So he could learn the next chapter and help her next day.

330
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,820
I remember everything about my father.

331
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,280
Everything.

332
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,650
That's just it.

333
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,890
I don't know shit about my dad.

334
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:13,300
I don't remember him yelling, I don't remember him smiling.

335
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,080
To be honest with you,

336
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,450
I don't remember what the hell he look like.

337
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:25,240
I had all the memories...he is just never there

338
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,760
You ain't gonna be like that, Brian.

339
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,870
We can't keep running, Dom.

340
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,550
We got to get out.

341
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,450
We got to get out, now.

342
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:55,910
You're right.

343
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,770
This is how we are gonna do it.

344
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,720
We are gonna use this into one last job.

345
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:21,160
We are gonna take all the Reyes money.

346
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,430
Every dime of it.

347
00:40:23,830 --> 00:40:26,540
And then, disappear...

348
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,870
forever

349
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:35,140
New passports, new life, and no more looking over our shoulder.

350
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,820
- And we are just gonna buy our freedom. - That's right.

351
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,060
You realize we are talking about

352
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,510
going up against most powerful guy in all over Rio.

353
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,820
Yes. We are.

354
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:45,670
Then we are gonna need a team.

355
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,580
Alright, let's go through the basics real quick.

356
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,200
What do we got?

357
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,520
First, we are gonna need a chameleon.

358
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:02,020
Someone who can blend in... anywhere.

359
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:04,350
What else?

360
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:05,780
A fast talker.

361
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,070
Someone who can bullshit the way out of anything.

362
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,070
I got that.

363
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,710
These guys are gonna have a lot of surveillance we are

364
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,880
gonna need someone who can schedule the circuits.

365
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,790
And with those circuits, Reyes is gonna have a "Wall".

366
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,190
We are gonna need the guys who can punch through those walls.

367
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,270
What else?

368
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,500
Utilities and weapons.

369
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:29,290
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

370
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:33,370
Someone who backup every position.

371
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,600
Yeah? What else we need ?

372
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:39,870
Most importantly we are gonna need two persistent drivers.

373
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:42,660
Guys who don't crack under pressure.

374
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,750
Guys who never lose.

375
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:47,990
You know we got that.

376
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,160
Ah...hell not.

377
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:20,380
I see they really stared the bottom of the beer.

378
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,130
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

379
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:27,380
When you are gonna give Martin Luther King his car back?

380
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:31,060
As soon as you give Rick James his jacket back.

381
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,550
Sexy legs baby girl.

382
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,710
What time do they open?

383
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:56,200
They open the same time when I pull this trigger.

384
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,550
Want me to open them?

385
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:10,740
Yeah anybody can talk shit in spanish

386
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,620
- Two fails, I am not fail...  - Two fails.

387
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:21,700
- Who are these clowns men? - Circus clowns.

388
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:26,030
I thought comply is too illegal in Brazil.

389
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:29,180
I see, you have all met.

390
00:43:29,590 --> 00:43:31,060
Here he is.

391
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,290
You know when you called me to come to Rio,

392
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,070
I assumed it would be for something more exciting than this.

393
00:43:43,670 --> 00:43:46,540
This is Tej, the best circuit men in the east coast.

394
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,620
This is my boy Roman Pearce,

395
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,880
we go way back from juvenile.

396
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,640
I pulled that job with him Miami.

397
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:53,930
I heard about you.

398
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:55,830
Nice stakes.

399
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,610
Yeah, the rest were sold out.

400
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,290
So, whats this all about, Dom?

401
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:02,860
Why you drag us half way around the world.

402
00:44:04,490 --> 00:44:05,540
Because we got a job.

403
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:09,260
Alright, so target's name is Hernan Reyes.

404
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,000
He runs the drug scene out there.

405
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:12,980
He has never been busted

406
00:44:13,030 --> 00:44:14,360
because he doesn't leave a paper trail.

407
00:44:14,450 --> 00:44:16,230
No paper trails means no banks.

408
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,340
No banks means cash houses.

409
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:19,400
That's right.

410
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,130
To tell you exact,

411
00:44:21,130 --> 00:44:22,470
it's spread throughout the city.

412
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:25,740
And we are gonna hit them all.

413
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,140
- All of them.  - All of them.

414
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:33,010
Sounds crazy. Bring us to whole another country,

415
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:35,450
so that we can rob the dude who runs it.

416
00:44:36,630 --> 00:44:38,250
I thought this is business,

417
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:39,980
sounds personal to me.

418
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,060
Is that what this is?

419
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:43,910
I got love for you all,

420
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,270
but personal ain't good business.

421
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:49,300
I can't do this homie.

422
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:54,820
So, what we are talking about is a 100 million dollar.

423
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:56,760
You say what?

424
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,570
See, sometimes I be over-thinking,

425
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:03,660
maybe and you know I know...we just met...but,

426
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:04,330
you just kinda gotta...

427
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,070
A 100 million dollars.

428
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,580
And everything we take, we split even.

429
00:45:09,950 --> 00:45:11,720
So, that's 11 million a piece,

430
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,940
I am down.

431
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:15,470
I am in.

432
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,240
11 million?

433
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,750
Sounds like a whole lotta vaginal activity to me.

434
00:45:22,270 --> 00:45:23,430
You can't pull off all the heist

435
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:25,340
on the same mark, you just can't.

436
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,640
Yeah, as soon as we hit the first one they are gonna

437
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,710
do everything they can to protect their assets.

438
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,610
Exactly.

439
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:28,550
That's all of it.

440
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,500
You're dead men. You're all dead men.

441
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:33,750
You don't have a place to hide.

442
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:38,050
Who is hiding?

443
00:46:38,110 --> 00:46:40,270
Are you crazy ? Are you crazy?

444
00:46:40,510 --> 00:46:42,040
Do you know whose house this is?

445
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:43,420
Whose money are you stealing?

446
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,110
We ain't stealing.

447
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:08,150
You tell your boss, exactly who did this.

448
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,850
Tell him there is more coming.

449
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:17,160
Wallah

450
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:19,410
Turn it over.

451
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:27,810
Its running alright, checks out fine.

452
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,850
Keep looking.

453
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,590
Boss, if something was missing we would know.

454
00:48:04,230 --> 00:48:07,360
Its a goddamn shame to put a bullshit like that on a classic.

455
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,030
Here, as well slap some on light on it.

456
00:48:21,590 --> 00:48:22,590
They took the chip.

457
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:25,040
We got a hit on the police scanner.

458
00:48:25,330 --> 00:48:27,130
Armed robbery in the house of golan.

459
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:31,770
Alright if that's our guys then

460
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:34,650
whatever was on that chip led them directly to that house.

461
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:35,670
It's them for sure.

462
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:36,950
How do you know that?

463
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:40,240
Because no one else in Rio is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

464
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,860
Number 1 is on the move, man.

465
00:50:43,830 --> 00:50:45,220
Two is on the move.

466
00:51:10,330 --> 00:51:11,410
Yeah, I got mine.

467
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,600
I got eyes on five.

468
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,110
I know you said they were consolidating money somewhere.

469
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,050
But you all ain't gonna believe this.

470
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,980
Well, this job has got a little harder.

471
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:22,230
If he is moving it into a police station,

472
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:24,800
he has got some serious brass in his pocket.

473
00:52:26,790 --> 00:52:28,160
Hell yeah, we can't do this.

474
00:52:28,510 --> 00:52:31,410
We can't or we shouldn't.

475
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,620
I think it doesn't change a thing.

476
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:39,790
I say we stick to the plan.

477
00:52:40,820 --> 00:52:41,950
You say what?

478
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,040
This shit just went from mission impossible

479
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,970
to mission freakin' insanity.

480
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:49,400
Whatever man!

481
00:52:49,470 --> 00:52:50,880
I ain't scared. I am just letting you all know.

482
00:52:51,020 --> 00:52:52,650
Going in that bouty, it's just crazy.

483
00:52:58,170 --> 00:52:59,310
What time is robbery?

484
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:00,900
Around 11' o clock.

485
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:04,380
Here we go.

486
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:07,430
Enhance it.

487
00:53:09,990 --> 00:53:12,610
Their faces are covered. Run it through FRS.

488
00:53:18,850 --> 00:53:20,290
Well, hello you son of a bitch.

489
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:24,310
Wilkes, run the photos of

490
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,590
known associates of Torretto and

491
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:28,590
O'Conner against custom entries in Brazil within last 2 weeks.

492
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,040
Check planes, trains, boats

493
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:31,710
and everything short of a goddamn space shuttle.

494
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:40,810
They can change their names but, they can't change their faces.

495
00:53:41,960 --> 00:53:43,580
Something big is going down.

496
00:53:45,540 --> 00:53:46,790
That's a 1970 Charger.

497
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:47,430
Let's go.

498
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,770
Upload these facts into the database have the computer

499
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:52,070
cross-check them with the overhead satellites at every 15 minutes.

500
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,350
Stand behind in two.

501
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:55,090
If these vehicles move on the streets of Rio,

502
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,050
I wanna know about it.

503
00:55:20,430 --> 00:55:22,610
The beauty of police offices.

504
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:26,750
A blueprint.

505
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:28,570
This is where they are keeping the money.

506
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:29,870
The vault's in the evidence room.

507
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,890
Can I get everyone's attention right here for a second,

508
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:38,800
we are talking about breaking into a police station.

509
00:55:38,970 --> 00:55:42,050
Is anyone listening to those words? Anybody? Po-Po,

510
00:55:42,430 --> 00:55:44,880
Five O, one time, peaks,

511
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,110
people we don't like.

512
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:47,290
You know police stations are

513
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:49,130
designed actually to let people in and out.

514
00:55:49,390 --> 00:55:50,940
That's why it's a stealth mission.

515
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,420
We move in and out before they even know we are there.

516
00:55:53,790 --> 00:55:55,060
Well, we need to get eyes in there.

517
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:58,150
At least, to find out how big the model of that vault.

518
00:56:03,470 --> 00:56:05,330
Who's the folk you know, do all this.

519
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:15,720
Wait...what do you mean?

520
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:18,520
Why me?

521
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,120
Because you got the biggest mouth.

522
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,630
That is for damn certain.

523
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,400
Hello beautiful. Look at those dimples sexy, sexy.

524
00:56:36,630 --> 00:56:38,820
Love those glasses, where did you get them from?

525
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,640
Is it gucci frames or something?

526
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,550
Damn.

527
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,760
Who are you sir?

528
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,590
Special agent O'Conner. US federal bureo of investigation.

529
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:52,460
It says caucasian?

530
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:55,160
Well, its the tan...you know tan.

531
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,170
Look, I am working this case

532
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:02,180
and I got some evidence here to be held.

533
00:57:02,510 --> 00:57:05,240
But I need to get in and check your storage facility first.

534
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:05,890
Nope.

535
00:57:05,950 --> 00:57:07,560
Look man I know you are a true professional

536
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,170
and I respects you, I promise.

537
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:11,420
You know, it look like you workout a little bit too.

538
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:13,450
What's you benchmark? 350.

539
00:57:16,770 --> 00:57:18,210
Look, I'm just trying to do my job.

540
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:21,120
My boss sent me here to just make sure everything is safe.

541
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:22,310
It will be safe.

542
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,260
Ok, will you let me just come in and take a quick peek.

543
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:26,080
- Nope.  - Come on, man.

544
00:57:27,210 --> 00:57:28,260
Hook a brother up please.

545
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,710
No. And you are not my brother.

546
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,980
Brother from another mother?

547
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,910
Look, no one enters the facility but authorized evidence personnel,

548
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,430
now stop wasting my time.

549
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,350
- I am going to call the embassy.  - No, no, no.

550
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,040
We good, we don't need to call them. For what?

551
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:40,570
We good.

552
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,910
Here, I got the box.

553
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:44,210
We all good, I promise you.

554
00:57:44,610 --> 00:57:46,020
Thank you so much for your time.

555
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,630
I swore to god, if I was on the other side of the glass

556
00:57:48,630 --> 00:57:49,520
I will bust your damn face

557
00:57:49,690 --> 00:57:50,540
and translate that.

558
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,630
You see, I think I make a better special agent than you ever did.

559
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:16,670
Well, that depends on how you define special.

560
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:22,700
Oh..man, let's see what we got. Have fun.

561
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:31,350
Alright come on.

562
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,880
Though, you still can't drive.

563
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:42,680
You see. Now I see why you always getting accidents.

564
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:45,290
You can't drive a damn remote control car.

565
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:47,220
Shut up right now.

566
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:48,150
- I am not gonna shut up.  - Shut up.

567
00:58:48,210 --> 00:58:50,580
Strap him in his safety belt man.

568
00:58:53,950 --> 00:58:56,130
Give me the remote, going left. It looks like

569
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:57,900
something right over there to the left. What is that?

570
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,170
Bingo.

571
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,150
What is this, 6 x 6?

572
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:05,650
8 x 12?

573
00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:10,190
7 x 12. 18-inch thick steel. Re-Enforced wall,

574
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:13,530
with insulated copper core to protect it against thermal lance.

575
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,190
The class 3 electronical lock would sure fire.

576
00:59:16,710 --> 00:59:19,440
And a biometric palm scanner.

577
00:59:19,690 --> 00:59:21,990
Ten times the top of the line security.

578
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,630
Do I wanna know, how you know all that?

579
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:25,960
I had a life before you know me O'Conner.

580
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:27,450
Let's just leave it with that, alright.

581
00:59:28,020 --> 00:59:29,250
She is a beauty, though.

582
00:59:29,770 --> 00:59:31,170
Beauty as in good?

583
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:34,620
Beauty as in you know... start of playing hard to get.

584
00:59:35,210 --> 00:59:38,840
And, no matter how much I care her, no matter how much I love her

585
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:42,670
in the end she still ain't gonna give up that ass.

586
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:11,440
I got this, relax man, relax.

587
01:02:31,890 --> 01:02:33,710
Got it, we got it.

588
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,080
Yeah, we are looking at four cameras.

589
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:39,670
Now, that's some high end shit too. Marker optics.

590
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:43,730
They refill the view, 10 seconds oscillation.

591
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:45,710
Nah, that's a narrow window man?

592
01:02:45,860 --> 01:02:47,710
Can we just stop the scanner and replace the image.

593
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:49,930
Nah. Its hooked up into a digital sync.

594
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:51,440
Ain't no way around the system.

595
01:02:52,020 --> 01:02:53,760
The best we can do is peek.

596
01:02:54,210 --> 01:02:56,760
We are gonna need some real fast cars to get to this.

597
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:57,960
And, not just fast,

598
01:02:58,420 --> 01:02:59,740
we need a hard ride and air.

599
01:03:00,620 --> 01:03:02,000
We need something agile.

600
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,990
You guys mark up a track.

601
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:08,190
O'Conner, lets go get some cars.

602
01:03:48,890 --> 01:03:50,020
Home, sweet home.

603
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:13,440
How about that? All motors and no tuning issues?

604
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:15,240
I always wanted one of those.

605
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,730
Held the record on the Envadeda 3 years running.

606
01:04:22,310 --> 01:04:25,060
You got a lot of bones to bring your problems here Torreto.

607
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,390
Not to mention a cop.

608
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:30,260
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

609
01:04:30,740 --> 01:04:33,590
Word on the street is that a lot of people are looking for you two.

610
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:37,600
But, you didn't think we would recognise you?

611
01:04:39,060 --> 01:04:40,680
Well, what kind of car you own?

612
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:43,700
That little cool may run the street around here,

613
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:50,130
but that monster has never seen a set ot tail lights, ever.

614
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:51,620
Well she is about to.

615
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:03,930
Lets go, legend.

616
01:05:05,110 --> 01:05:07,490
Car for a car.

617
01:05:07,790 --> 01:05:08,760
Car for car?

618
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:11,140
If you want it, come and get it.

619
01:05:24,360 --> 01:05:26,200
Really?

620
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:28,940
Whe...whe...where did you get that from?

621
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:30,360
Popa's mark.

622
01:05:30,520 --> 01:05:33,070
Ok O'Conner, give me your best shot.

623
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,550
How was that one?

624
01:05:57,700 --> 01:05:58,610
Camera caught you.

625
01:05:59,140 --> 01:05:59,870
What?

626
01:06:00,010 --> 01:06:01,140
Yeah it still caught you.

627
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,110
Then I will milk the hell out of that thing too.

628
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,440
We are gonna need a faster car.

629
01:06:28,310 --> 01:06:30,550
Exactly why your ass ain't been driving.

630
01:06:30,660 --> 01:06:31,630
You gotta re-blaze.

631
01:06:43,100 --> 01:06:44,550
I think, I am in love.

632
01:06:48,350 --> 01:06:49,700
That was a real solid work,

633
01:06:50,270 --> 01:06:52,520
but I think camera 3 still caught you though.

634
01:06:53,740 --> 01:06:55,100
Let's do it again.

635
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,230
That's your piggy bank? You kidding me yup?

636
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:11,000
Where the hell can I get one of these?

637
01:07:11,770 --> 01:07:13,710
Well we had a life before you met us.

638
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,390
Alright, well I get to work on the electronics tunneler.

639
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:19,570
But there's still another problem,

640
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:22,220
palm scanner.

641
01:07:22,450 --> 01:07:23,950
And without Reyes hand-print,

642
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,920
Houdini himself can not open this bitch.

643
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,560
How do you know it's Reyes's hand-print?

644
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:30,610
You got 100 million dollars in a safe,

645
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,810
you gonna put somebody else's hand-print on it?

646
01:07:40,530 --> 01:07:42,180
How are we supposed to get Reyes's hand-print?

647
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:46,750
Han, you are up.

648
01:07:48,610 --> 01:07:51,320
Sure, gotta make the easy stuff.

649
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,050
Let's go, I will drive.

650
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,550
That makes six bodyguards.

651
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:14,460
Seven.

652
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,900
Do you think that guy with a funny look is a tourist?

653
01:08:23,150 --> 01:08:24,870
So, how long were you in the army?

654
01:08:34,800 --> 01:08:39,720
I got out of military probably the same time you quit smoking.

655
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,440
The amount of chips you ate.

656
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,460
The way you always had to keep your hands and mouth busy.

657
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:48,750
You are a two packs a day, for sure.

658
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:52,690
Un-Filtered.

659
01:08:56,770 --> 01:08:58,120
Well, this is a bust.

660
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,400
How you gonna get Reyes fingerprint out of here?

661
01:09:02,550 --> 01:09:04,080
You need to do some more recon.

662
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:05,600
Kinda couple extra guys.

663
01:09:05,890 --> 01:09:09,870
Alright, you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

664
01:10:07,850 --> 01:10:09,710
We gonna figure this out, I promise you.

665
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,000
What's that?

666
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:17,890
I thought she was more of a thong man?

667
01:10:18,710 --> 01:10:20,410
We got the prints.

668
01:10:21,380 --> 01:10:22,890
Where?

669
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,330
Ok. That's crazy.

670
01:10:28,250 --> 01:10:30,160
So, did he just like slap that ass?

671
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:32,610
Or, did he like grab and hold on to it?

672
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:36,960
This will work.

673
01:10:38,330 --> 01:10:40,080
- I'm impressed.  - Got it?

674
01:10:40,750 --> 01:10:43,630
Got it. But, you still didn't answer the question.

675
01:10:49,400 --> 01:10:50,170
Guys! Guys!

676
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:51,560
Guys, we have a problem.

677
01:10:51,740 --> 01:10:53,270
The whole team just got burned.

678
01:10:55,580 --> 01:10:56,860
Now we are all wanted.

679
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:00,580
Hang on a second.

680
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,160
Us diplomatic security service issued the warrants.

681
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,680
Agent . Hold on a second.

682
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:09,690
Hey Dom.

683
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:14,420
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

684
01:11:16,180 --> 01:11:17,190
Yeah.

685
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:20,580
Hobbs is the leader of the elite task force for the DSS.

686
01:11:21,100 --> 01:11:22,040
So, he is good?

687
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,880
When the FBI wants to find somebody that's who they call.

688
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:27,010
Because he never misses his mark.

689
01:11:27,380 --> 01:11:29,770
This guy is...he is old testament.

690
01:11:30,510 --> 01:11:33,450
Blood, bullets, rap the God that's his style.

691
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:35,400
And right now he is hunting us?

692
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:38,160
Dom, we are gonna move up our time line.

693
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,210
Yes, but how?

694
01:11:39,430 --> 01:11:40,630
This thing has already been difficult.

695
01:11:43,070 --> 01:11:43,570
If it ain't that.

696
01:11:43,630 --> 01:11:45,220
We need more room to breathe.

697
01:11:47,630 --> 01:11:48,750
Roman is right.

698
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,860
We need to get some fresh air.

699
01:11:58,150 --> 01:11:59,830
It got a hit.

700
01:12:00,330 --> 01:12:01,330
Let's move.

701
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:09,740
Move! Move! Move!

702
01:12:16,200 --> 01:12:17,760
Stopped, about a block ahead.

703
01:12:18,470 --> 01:12:19,880
Park it, we are going on foot.

704
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:44,650
Hey, Toretto.

705
01:12:52,450 --> 01:12:53,730
You're under arrest.

706
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:55,160
Arrest?

707
01:12:56,770 --> 01:12:58,570
I don't feel like I am under arrest.

708
01:12:59,390 --> 01:13:00,510
How about you, Brian?

709
01:13:00,720 --> 01:13:01,920
Nah...not a bit.

710
01:13:03,810 --> 01:13:05,010
Not even a little bit.

711
01:13:05,090 --> 01:13:07,420
I will just give a minute, it will sink in.

712
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:12,280
We didn't kill those feds.

713
01:13:12,580 --> 01:13:14,340
- That's Reyes.  - I don't give a shit.

714
01:13:14,910 --> 01:13:17,430
Just here to bring in two assholes whose names hit my desk.

715
01:13:17,670 --> 01:13:20,920
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

716
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:24,860
That's funny.

717
01:13:25,860 --> 01:13:26,980
From a guy who took the oath of a cop

718
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:28,890
and then went against everything he stood for?

719
01:13:29,180 --> 01:13:30,540
Or, some wanna be tough guy prick

720
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,250
who beat a man half to death with a socket rinch.

721
01:13:33,840 --> 01:13:34,860
That real tough.

722
01:13:36,100 --> 01:13:38,460
You turn around and put hands behind your back.

723
01:13:40,280 --> 01:13:41,250
I don't think so.

724
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,020
You are so mistaken to think you got a goddamn choice boy.

725
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:52,540
Your mistake ? Thinking you are in America.

726
01:13:55,630 --> 01:13:57,960
You're a long way from home.

727
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,510
This is Brazil!

728
01:14:19,310 --> 01:14:21,040
Come on boss, another day.

729
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,560
Come on, it's way too heat.

730
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,420
I will see you soon, Toretto.

731
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:36,630
I am looking forward to it.

732
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:15,680
Yep.

733
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:16,780
Tracker's on.

734
01:15:18,540 --> 01:15:19,360
Got him.

735
01:16:25,540 --> 01:16:27,320
I don't understand. Why come here?

736
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:31,110
Why risk it all for 20 dollar worth of silver?

737
01:16:34,810 --> 01:16:36,080
Because it's worth it.

738
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:41,070
You should run,  you know!

739
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,400
Hobbs will find you

740
01:16:46,340 --> 01:16:49,240
You have every reason to leave, why stay ?

741
01:16:56,720 --> 01:16:57,860
Why do you?

742
01:17:00,210 --> 01:17:02,580
My husband was a good police officer...

743
01:17:03,150 --> 01:17:04,840
an honest man...

744
01:17:06,240 --> 01:17:07,740
we both grew up here.

745
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:11,090
Two years ago, he was murdered in the streets

746
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:13,080
right outside out our door.

747
01:17:15,470 --> 01:17:17,240
Reyes owns this place.

748
01:17:17,470 --> 01:17:19,240
He gives things to people.

749
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:23,310
And, everything has a price.

750
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:28,580
People here need a new start.

751
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,610
They need to be free.

752
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:44,020
You didn't killed those men in the train, did you?

753
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,520
Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you.

754
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,510
Was she so special to you?

755
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,720
I never thought anyone could understand how much.

756
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:16,220
But you do.

757
01:18:51,850 --> 01:18:53,160
Close, but not enough.

758
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,270
Time window is too small, man.

759
01:18:55,440 --> 01:18:59,150
The only way we can beat the cameras, is with invisible cars.

760
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:03,890
And I know, just where to get them.

761
01:19:07,410 --> 01:19:09,110
Let's take a ride boys.

762
01:19:16,620 --> 01:19:18,260
Don't hurt yourself.

763
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:39,640
It's been a while since i have been behind the wheel of one of these.

764
01:19:40,060 --> 01:19:42,220
First time I've ever been in the front seat.

765
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:51,240
Hey, Rom what took you so long.

766
01:19:51,530 --> 01:19:52,690
I thought for sure, you be showing up

767
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:54,450
with some chrome spinners or something.

768
01:19:54,770 --> 01:19:57,620
Ha.....hah....real funny.

769
01:19:58,970 --> 01:20:00,060
I got a 100,000 that says

770
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:02,320
I can take you all in the next quarter mile.

771
01:20:02,490 --> 01:20:04,440
Yeah, you broke that like you got a 100 grand.

772
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:06,460
If we pull off this job, I will.

773
01:20:07,210 --> 01:20:09,970
Next two lights, a 100,000.

774
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:13,600
If we don't pull this job off, we are probably dead anyway.

775
01:20:14,110 --> 01:20:15,360
Let's make it a million.

776
01:20:17,110 --> 01:20:17,780
I like that.

777
01:20:17,810 --> 01:20:19,400
Alright, million dollar a quarter mile.

778
01:20:20,660 --> 01:20:21,840
Alright then.

779
01:20:22,530 --> 01:20:25,300
We only live once, let's do it.

780
01:20:25,690 --> 01:20:26,690
What do you say Dom?

781
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:28,770
Are we talking or we racing?

782
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,480
Just don't cheat this time.

783
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:33,380
You gotta let that go.

784
01:21:09,640 --> 01:21:11,400
It makes too easy for me boys.

785
01:21:14,150 --> 01:21:15,190
No.

786
01:21:17,150 --> 01:21:18,190
Not this time, Dom.

787
01:21:22,730 --> 01:21:23,970
Got your wanted.

788
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:56,860
Yeah, owned you....owned you.

789
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,710
Good race, O'Conner.

790
01:22:13,100 --> 01:22:13,920
Thanks, Dom.

791
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,320
You don't on the way, Rich.

792
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:19,920
Hold on, you can see it.

793
01:22:20,750 --> 01:22:21,920
The man right there!

794
01:22:22,610 --> 01:22:24,270
He left off the throttle with a mile.

795
01:22:24,990 --> 01:22:26,000
You didn't do nothing.

796
01:22:26,240 --> 01:22:27,250
He let you win.

797
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:29,550
Bullshit.

798
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:52,860
Vince, what are you doing?

799
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,780
Quiet, you have been tracked.

800
01:23:24,490 --> 01:23:25,380
It's..ok...wait.

801
01:23:25,810 --> 01:23:27,510
Reyes's guys were waiting for me at the market.

802
01:23:29,700 --> 01:23:31,100
And, Vince saved my life.

803
01:23:36,430 --> 01:23:37,430
You hungry?

804
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:42,340
Yeah, sure

805
01:23:42,990 --> 01:23:43,880
Good!

806
01:23:45,140 --> 01:23:46,650
Because you are saying grace.

807
01:23:49,990 --> 01:23:50,930
Thanks Vince.

808
01:24:12,940 --> 01:24:14,890
Cheers...cheers...cheers.

809
01:24:15,040 --> 01:24:17,040
So we in Brazil, still a good life.

810
01:24:17,470 --> 01:24:18,150
Yeah.

811
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:19,250
So, you got a...you got a

812
01:24:19,270 --> 01:24:22,020
little more than 10-11 million dollars coming.

813
01:24:22,060 --> 01:24:23,240
What's you gonna do with your money?

814
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:24,810
- Me? - Yeah.

815
01:24:25,190 --> 01:24:26,340
Actually...man, I have been thinking about

816
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,020
opening up a garage back home.

817
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:30,250
A place where people can bring their cars,

818
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:32,500
and they get completely ripped off, you know what I mean?

819
01:24:32,890 --> 01:24:34,510
- Really? - Yeah.

820
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:37,380
So, your dream is to start a day job?

821
01:24:37,610 --> 01:24:39,480
That's...that's stupid...man, why would..

822
01:24:39,730 --> 01:24:41,000
Nah...that's not stupid at all. Man.

823
01:24:41,100 --> 01:24:41,960
I love what I do.

824
01:24:43,470 --> 01:24:45,260
You wanna know what I am gonna do with my money.

825
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,290
Find some cooking lesson for my man.

826
01:24:50,460 --> 01:24:54,100
See, see? There you with that theory man?

827
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:56,610
You know me...money and god damn thing.

828
01:24:56,950 --> 01:24:58,280
It's gonna take a little more than money

829
01:24:58,280 --> 01:25:00,550
to learn how to cook...that's all.

830
01:25:01,150 --> 01:25:03,270
But, I heard they were looking for a chef.

831
01:25:03,560 --> 01:25:06,040
Down at this animal shelter. Where you might....wanna.

832
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:14,260
Hey Dom,

833
01:25:17,410 --> 01:25:21,810
Listen, I know you have a separate job tomorrow.

834
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:24,650
If you need an extra men...

835
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:26,780
Mike, you are in.

836
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:36,990
You always have been a family.

837
01:25:43,580 --> 01:25:44,520
Thank you!

838
01:25:48,840 --> 01:25:49,990
Get something to eat.

839
01:25:51,830 --> 01:25:52,600
Yeah.

840
01:25:55,260 --> 01:25:57,220
Brian calls it a curse.

841
01:26:00,720 --> 01:26:02,100
She might be right.

842
01:26:07,270 --> 01:26:08,900
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

843
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:11,400
When your life is on the line,

844
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:14,460
that's when you manner by yourself.

845
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,160
That's a fair deal?

846
01:26:24,240 --> 01:26:25,770
We are less than 24 hours

847
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:28,360
from biggest celebration of our life.

848
01:26:28,640 --> 01:26:29,700
You gotta re-fill.

849
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:31,010
This is some serious stuff.

850
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,600
No, I am good...I am good...no...thank you!

851
01:26:33,980 --> 01:26:35,000
No, she can't.

852
01:26:37,140 --> 01:26:37,970
What do you mean?

853
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:38,790
She can't.

854
01:26:39,470 --> 01:26:40,380
What do you mean, she can't?

855
01:26:46,200 --> 01:26:47,950
Are you serious right now?

856
01:26:48,830 --> 01:26:51,600
Is that the reason you let him beat you in the quarter mile?

857
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:54,890
That was a baby gift.

858
01:26:54,940 --> 01:26:55,870
No, that's messed up.

859
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:56,500
But, still it's a baby gift.

860
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:58,670
No, you are not taking that from me.

861
01:26:58,760 --> 01:27:00,620
Wait, wait...hold on a second.

862
01:27:01,430 --> 01:27:04,450
Did he just smack that ass or, did he grab the ass?

863
01:27:06,970 --> 01:27:09,820
Thanks. Thank you.

864
01:27:11,330 --> 01:27:15,270
It's your boy. Why would you keep something like that away from us.

865
01:27:15,390 --> 01:27:16,410
You did it again, huh.

866
01:27:16,720 --> 01:27:17,840
Baby gift?

867
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,120
I have no idea what they are talking about?

868
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:26,880
Toast!

869
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:38,690
Money will come and go, we know that.

870
01:27:40,320 --> 01:27:42,000
The most important thing in life

871
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,010
will always be the people in this room.

872
01:27:45,350 --> 01:27:50,120
Right here, right now.

873
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:57,140
Salute, de favelia... salute...salute...

874
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,110
I'm all set.

875
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:09,790
Santos, all good?

876
01:28:11,490 --> 01:28:13,330
Yeah, I am always good, bro.

877
01:28:17,690 --> 01:28:19,620
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

878
01:28:20,290 --> 01:28:21,800
We are not gonna get a better window.

879
01:28:23,030 --> 01:28:24,870
Ok guys, it's showtime.

880
01:28:25,390 --> 01:28:27,180
First team in position, let's go.

881
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,220
Come on, let's do this.

882
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,890
Hey Dom, I got eyes on Mia.

883
01:28:49,570 --> 01:28:52,720
Moscow, Berlin, Goa, Hong Kong.

884
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:54,610
What do they have all in common?

885
01:28:58,450 --> 01:29:00,490
We are one hour away from rest of that.

886
01:29:01,140 --> 01:29:01,970
Yeah.

887
01:29:04,610 --> 01:29:05,820
Police!

888
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,540
Come on, go.

889
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:22,710
You just made a big mistake.

890
01:29:23,850 --> 01:29:25,570
It took me while to find out that tracking chip.

891
01:29:26,390 --> 01:29:27,940
But, not as long to flip the receiver.

892
01:29:28,210 --> 01:29:29,060
You're going down Torretto.

893
01:29:29,740 --> 01:29:30,510
I'm right here.

894
01:30:59,610 --> 01:31:00,110
Dom!

895
01:31:00,190 --> 01:31:01,520
Stand back, I got this.

896
01:31:07,630 --> 01:31:10,590
Dom, please, Dom.

897
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:17,970
Stop!

898
01:31:27,430 --> 01:31:28,360
Dom!

899
01:32:31,580 --> 01:32:32,530
Yeah?

900
01:32:33,510 --> 01:32:34,640
We are coming in now.

901
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:39,210
Tell the marshals to prepare a vehicle to home back.

902
01:32:47,670 --> 01:32:48,570
Ambush!

903
01:33:06,820 --> 01:33:08,540
Wilkes, suppressing fire. Set them down.

904
01:33:14,410 --> 01:33:15,530
Macroy, cover me.

905
01:33:21,020 --> 01:33:21,680
Watch that.

906
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:36,490
Cut us loose! Come on! Cut us loose!

907
01:35:35,200 --> 01:35:38,960
Everything all right? Let's go! Let's go!

908
01:36:09,850 --> 01:36:11,260
Hey Dom,

909
01:36:17,530 --> 01:36:18,910
you didn't meet my son

910
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:20,920
Nico.

911
01:36:26,600 --> 01:36:27,480
I will.

912
01:36:30,930 --> 01:36:31,980
He is a good kid.

913
01:36:36,110 --> 01:36:37,890
You know, we named him after you

914
01:36:40,410 --> 01:36:41,430
Dominic.

915
01:36:49,130 --> 01:36:50,690
You have my word, Vince.

916
01:36:57,690 --> 01:36:59,330
You were always my brother.

917
01:37:09,360 --> 01:37:11,550
See you my brother.

918
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:24,610
We need to move, we don't have that much time.

919
01:37:25,220 --> 01:37:26,260
I got some flight out,

920
01:37:26,460 --> 01:37:28,660
that leaves Rio de Janeiro in next 5 hours.

921
01:37:28,900 --> 01:37:30,190
Not to run away....

922
01:37:31,990 --> 01:37:33,450
To finish the job.

923
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:37,220
Are you crazy Dom ? We can't.

924
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:39,150
It's a suicide mission.

925
01:37:40,170 --> 01:37:42,010
That's your man over there on the table.

926
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:46,670
The plan is busted, this is bullshit man.

927
01:37:46,830 --> 01:37:48,020
Reyes knows we are coming.

928
01:37:48,350 --> 01:37:49,020
He's right.

929
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:51,790
They tripled the detail of the police station ,

930
01:37:52,930 --> 01:37:54,250
it's gonna be a wall of gunfire.

931
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,070
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

932
01:37:59,940 --> 01:38:02,060
It's a trap man, you know that.

933
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:05,320
Dom! Listen to them.

934
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:07,340
Run, before its too late.

935
01:38:07,540 --> 01:38:10,930
Leave Rio, you can be free.

936
01:38:13,530 --> 01:38:14,570
I don't need freedom.

937
01:38:17,070 --> 01:38:18,650
You should know that.

938
01:38:23,430 --> 01:38:26,260
You know you are all free to make your own choices.

939
01:38:29,920 --> 01:38:30,880
I am in.

940
01:38:40,640 --> 01:38:41,940
I will ride with you, Toretto.

941
01:38:45,510 --> 01:38:47,800
At least, until we kill that son of a bitch.

942
01:38:56,300 --> 01:38:57,520
So, what's the plan Dom?

943
01:38:58,900 --> 01:39:00,580
We can't just go sneaking around any more.

944
01:39:02,440 --> 01:39:03,810
We don't sneak.

945
01:39:05,070 --> 01:39:07,050
The only thing that he cares about is his money.

946
01:39:08,520 --> 01:39:11,960
If we pull that, we pull him.

947
01:39:58,810 --> 01:39:59,690
Are you ready?

948
01:40:02,330 --> 01:40:03,200
I'm ready.

949
01:42:08,060 --> 01:42:09,040
Holl it out, Mia?

950
01:42:09,300 --> 01:42:10,920
You got a straight shot, two blocks.

951
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:12,920
Go right.

952
01:42:13,070 --> 01:42:13,730
Got it

953
01:42:36,400 --> 01:42:37,740
Wow, the plan's working.

954
01:42:37,790 --> 01:42:40,150
You guys have every cop car in Rio on your tail.

955
01:42:40,320 --> 01:42:41,350
You guys have to move fast.

956
01:42:43,050 --> 01:42:44,080
What's the best drop?

957
01:42:44,130 --> 01:42:47,210
Ok. Keep going straight another half mile at Du-luff-seeker.

958
01:42:47,400 --> 01:42:48,620
And then go left.

959
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:54,250
It ain't gonna work

960
01:42:56,290 --> 01:42:57,910
Spikes ahead Dom, we got spikes.

961
01:42:58,120 --> 01:42:59,060
We are going right.

962
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,510
Nah... it's too tight... we are not gonna fit.

963
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:03,740
We have no choice. Now.

964
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:24,540
Sh...it!

965
01:43:31,490 --> 01:43:32,460
Holy...shit!

966
01:43:32,870 --> 01:43:34,060
Guys I am hearing all this chatter,

967
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:35,450
you just take out a bank ?

968
01:43:45,070 --> 01:43:46,110
Two in-Bound.

969
01:43:48,170 --> 01:43:49,690
Alright! There is an ally coming on your left.

970
01:43:49,730 --> 01:43:50,490
Yeah! I got it.

971
01:44:44,860 --> 01:44:45,920
You bastard.

972
01:45:09,560 --> 01:45:12,100
Alright Dom, right turn right here.

973
01:45:18,800 --> 01:45:20,520
Ok guys, there is a big group coming at you from south.

974
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,030
You have do something, now.

975
01:45:25,610 --> 01:45:26,500
Let's go wide.

976
01:47:14,210 --> 01:47:15,490
You all clear on the left.

977
01:47:15,620 --> 01:47:17,160
Good afternoon, officer.

978
01:47:19,470 --> 01:47:21,280
License and registration, please.

979
01:47:28,210 --> 01:47:30,420
Yeah! This is big boy stuff.

980
01:47:30,920 --> 01:47:32,430
We are clear on the right.

981
01:47:40,640 --> 01:47:43,050
- Thanks guys. - Anytime.

982
01:47:43,250 --> 01:47:44,850
I see you on the other side.

983
01:47:44,980 --> 01:47:48,350
You guys just copped out a 10 second window, make it count.

984
01:48:39,350 --> 01:48:42,910
No...there is too many of them.

985
01:48:43,030 --> 01:48:44,030
We are not gonna make it.

986
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:48,960
You're right, we aren't.

987
01:48:50,390 --> 01:48:52,380
- You are. - What are you talking about?

988
01:48:52,790 --> 01:48:54,930
Just let the vault go. Get out of there.

989
01:48:55,220 --> 01:48:56,660
You're a father now, Brian.

990
01:48:56,820 --> 01:48:57,880
No, I'm not leaving you.

991
01:48:57,980 --> 01:48:58,940
You stick with the plan.

992
01:48:59,730 --> 01:49:01,170
It was always the plan.

993
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:02,910
Take care of Mia.

994
01:49:03,330 --> 01:49:05,190
Dom, you listen to me now.

995
01:49:05,320 --> 01:49:07,250
Ok, you cut loose right now.

996
01:52:02,570 --> 01:52:04,060
I thought I told you to go on.

997
01:52:07,390 --> 01:52:08,590
Yeah! I had to make a call.

998
01:52:27,060 --> 01:52:29,580
Help me.

999
01:52:30,900 --> 01:52:34,660
That's for my team you son of a bitch.

1000
01:52:37,020 --> 01:52:38,100
It's hell of a mess.

1001
01:52:39,320 --> 01:52:40,240
Yeah, it is.

1002
01:52:42,390 --> 01:52:43,860
You know, I can't let you two to go.

1003
01:52:44,870 --> 01:52:45,820
I ain't made that way.

1004
01:52:48,880 --> 01:52:50,750
I will see to it that you bring yourself 24 hours.

1005
01:52:53,190 --> 01:52:54,250
The money stays though.

1006
01:52:55,290 --> 01:52:56,550
If I were you, I would use the time.

1007
01:52:57,820 --> 01:52:59,890
Make peace with whatever things you got left.

1008
01:53:05,250 --> 01:53:09,690
Because come tomorrow, I will find you.

1009
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:22,830
Toretto

1010
01:53:23,720 --> 01:53:24,940
I'll see you soon.

1011
01:53:27,930 --> 01:53:29,020
No, you won't.

1012
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:12,270
Thanks guys.

1013
01:54:12,610 --> 01:54:14,140
I see you on the other side.

1014
01:54:18,770 --> 01:54:21,220
You guys just copped out a 10 second window

1015
01:54:21,240 --> 01:54:22,210
Make it count.

1016
01:55:05,240 --> 01:55:07,490
Come on baby, don't be mean.

1017
01:57:35,390 --> 01:57:36,730
Right this way, my dear

1018
01:57:39,860 --> 01:57:42,140
Stay right here, I will be right back.

1019
01:57:43,600 --> 01:57:44,950
So, this is your dream...Huh

1020
01:57:45,790 --> 01:57:47,000
That's enough of me man

1021
01:57:47,300 --> 01:57:48,420
I take you are enjoying?

1022
01:57:48,580 --> 01:57:49,620
Absolutely...what's up...

1023
01:57:49,820 --> 01:57:50,930
Boy, what's going on?

1024
01:57:51,240 --> 01:57:52,460
- You good. - Yes, yes.

1025
01:57:53,060 --> 01:57:54,100
You know what's crazy?

1026
01:57:54,610 --> 01:57:56,750
There is only four of those cars in the whole world.

1027
01:57:57,510 --> 01:57:59,750
And I got the only one in western hemisphere

1028
01:58:00,430 --> 01:58:04,410
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi an offer he could not refuse.

1029
01:58:05,160 --> 01:58:07,500
And, that's a nice lady you got there too.

1030
01:58:07,630 --> 01:58:08,560
Oh...absolutely

1031
01:58:11,450 --> 01:58:13,100
Well...we got to go man. Let's do this

1032
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:14,920
Ok, I will drive.

1033
01:58:15,610 --> 01:58:17,930
In that? Come on man..No...no way

1034
01:58:18,350 --> 01:58:21,550
No...Not...not in this, in that!

1035
01:58:28,270 --> 01:58:29,750
Are you serious right now.

1036
01:58:30,490 --> 01:58:31,860
Oh..Man...this is crazy.

1037
01:58:31,940 --> 01:58:33,940
Yeah. So, I guess that means there are

1038
01:58:34,420 --> 01:58:37,060
two in the western hemisphere..Huh...huh

1039
01:58:37,650 --> 01:58:39,280
What's your smart ass gotta say now?

1040
01:58:40,600 --> 01:58:43,480
Well...you know what, we can always shine together baby.

1041
01:58:43,740 --> 01:58:45,720
Get dressed man, we got things to do.

1042
01:58:58,700 --> 01:58:59,730
So, where to now?

1043
01:59:00,300 --> 01:59:01,000
I don't know.

1044
01:59:01,690 --> 01:59:02,900
Never been to Madrid.

1045
01:59:04,350 --> 01:59:05,990
I thought you wanna go to Tokyo...

1046
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:08,090
We will get there...

1047
01:59:09,470 --> 01:59:10,730
Eventually...

1048
02:00:25,610 --> 02:00:27,840
This is the happiest I have ever seen my sister.

1049
02:00:29,670 --> 02:00:30,560
It goes with free.

1050
02:00:45,150 --> 02:00:46,490
You know? I wanna another shot.

1051
02:00:51,120 --> 02:00:51,900
Yeah?

1052
02:00:54,010 --> 02:00:54,670
Yeah.

1053
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:57,400
No wagers, no body-else,

1054
02:00:57,570 --> 02:00:59,050
just you and me, once and for all

1055
02:01:07,140 --> 02:01:09,240
You sure, you gonna handle the disappointment?

1056
02:01:09,820 --> 02:01:10,640
Are you?

1057
02:01:13,230 --> 02:01:14,440
Alright, O'Conner

1058
02:01:15,690 --> 02:01:16,960
Let's see what you got.

1059
02:03:45,150 --> 02:03:46,340
You need to look at that.

1060
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:52,740
Berlin, 3 am this morning.

1061
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:55,780
A team of drivers, hijacked a military convey.

1062
02:03:56,130 --> 02:03:57,420
- Toretto. - Nope

1063
02:03:59,230 --> 02:04:00,300
Ain't interested.

1064
02:04:00,310 --> 02:04:03,120
Yes, you are, keep looking.

1065
02:04:14,440 --> 02:04:16,380
You believe in ghosts.

1066
01:29:07,560 --> 01:29:08,540
Come on, go.

1067
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:22,710
You just made a big mistake.
