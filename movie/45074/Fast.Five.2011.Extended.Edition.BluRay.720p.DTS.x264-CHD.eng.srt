172
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:38,194
If we find out what it is, we'll know what we're up against.

173
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,339
HOBBS: All right, listen up! The men we're after are professional runners.

174
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,259
They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way

175
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,718
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

176
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:05,680
We find them, we take them as a team, and we bring them back.

177
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:10,268
And above all else, we don't ever, ever let them get into cars.

178
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,937
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, men. Let's go hunting.

179
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,193
Agente Hobbs! Chief of Police, Joo Alemeida.

180
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,444
Luke.

181
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,739
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

182
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,866
Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

183
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,493
Let me tell you something about these two men.

184
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,079
One is a former federal officer, been in deep cover for five years.

185
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,998
He knows every way you're going to come for him.

186
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:35,167
The other one is a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

187
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,795
spent half his life on the run avoiding folks like you.

188
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,715
Well, if there's anything we can do to help the DSS...

189
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,842
Two things. One, I need a translator.

190
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,427
We have plenty in the public relations department.

191
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,304
Elena Neves.

192
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,265
A patrol officer? You heard me.

193
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,226
But why? We have many more experienced people.

194
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,312
I like her smile.

195
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,314
What's the second thing?

196
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,276
Stay the fuck out of my way.

197
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,696
(DRILLING)

198
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,163
Brian. Hm?

199
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,041
I have something I have to tell you.

200
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,792
(DOOR OPENING) VINCE: God damn.

201
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:18,669
What a mess!

202
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:22,131
Where you been, man?

203
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:23,758
(CHUCKLING)

204
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,761
You better check that tone.

205
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,679
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

206
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,264
Stop it! Both of you.

207
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,727
Where were you, Vince?

208
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,939
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

209
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:41,650
Couldn't get out of there without leading them straight to you.

210
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:42,818
Had to wait them out.

211
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:44,612
That is such horseshit.

212
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,781
(SHOUTING) That was your job, and those were your guys! Hey!

213
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,449
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

214
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,326
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

215
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,494
Go walk it off.

216
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:10,179
REYES: Look, I would love to expand my operations into your countries

217
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,266
but, quite frankly, your business methods are too violent.

218
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,603
Let me tell you a true story.

219
00:23:17,813 --> 00:23:22,108
Five hundred years ago, the Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

220
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,653
each trying to get the country from their natives.

221
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:32,368
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing, determined to prove who was boss.

222
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,998
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

223
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,838
Personally, I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

224
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,091
They came bearing gifts.

225
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,468
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

226
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:54,014
Things that the natives couldn't get on their own,

227
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:57,351
but to continue receiving them, they had to work for the Portuguese.

228
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,897
And that's why all Brazilians speak Portuguese today.

229
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:06,444
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

230
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:10,781
they will eventually fight back because they have nothing to lose.

231
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,492
And that's the key.

232
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:17,371
I go into the favelas and give them something to lose.

233
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,207
Electricity, running water,

234
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,418
school rooms for their kids.

235
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:26,881
And for that taste of a better life,

236
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,384
I own them.

237
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,595
Gentlemen.

238
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,556
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

239
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,183
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

240
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,434
I apologize for the interruption.

241
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,520
Seor Reyes, may I speak with you?

242
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:44,106
We've found them.

243
00:24:45,567 --> 00:24:47,776
Pardon me, gentlemen.

244
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,919
DOM: Almost wish I didn't see that.

245
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:10,174
Almost.

246
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,301
Wait, Dom.

247
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,553
Mia was on that train.

248
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,263
(SHOUTING) My sister!

249
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,517
I didn't know. I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

250
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,936
You set up the deal!

251
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,647
I thought the job was for the cars.

252
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,857
I didn't know.

253
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:28,400
All they want is the chip.

254
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:32,112
Damn!

255
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:34,406
You should've come clean.

256
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,075
What's going on out here?

257
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,160
Nothing.

258
00:25:38,286 --> 00:25:41,705
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip. I can take this to them.

259
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,958
They'll give it to Reyes and set things right.

260
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,043
Get out.

261
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,923
What?

262
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,049
Get out!

263
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,226
You never listen to me.

264
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,980
Not when I told you he was a cop, and not now.

265
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:10,776
You never trust me and look where it's gotten us.

266
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,153
Look at our family now.

267
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:18,284
I can't go home! Your sister is stuck in this life!

268
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,327
Where's Letty, Dom?

269
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,831
Where's Letty?

270
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,773
Plasma cutter.

271
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,110
Wilkes, I want a list of every place within 50 miles

272
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,945
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

273
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,156
Pass me that manifest.

274
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,831
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

275
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,292
You asked for me? I did.

276
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,044
May I ask why?

277
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,546
My smile is not that great.

278
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,677
Your husband was an officer who was gunned down in the favela.

279
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,638
Six months later, you upped and joined the force.

280
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,972
You're motivated.

281
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,809
Plus, I figure you're the only one in Rio who can't be bought.

282
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,311
Am I right?

283
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,731
Yes. Of course I am.

284
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:31,982
Good news, bad news.

285
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,734
You know I like my dessert first.

286
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,778
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

287
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:37,863
Found a couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

288
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,657
One set of tracks headed west

289
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,409
until it hit the main highway, then disappeared.

290
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,786
But another set of tracks headed east.

291
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,246
A 1 07-inch wheelbase, eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

292
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:48,916
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

293
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,584
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

294
00:27:50,669 --> 00:27:51,877
Pretty easy in this scrub.

295
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,712
Can't move without leaving a sign.

296
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,255
Give me the damn veggies.

297
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,634
The ground rolls into a hardpack and we lost that track, too.

298
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:01,470
Not necessarily.

299
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,973
That road heads up through the hills into the favelas.

300
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,393
Couple of years ago, it was washed out by a storm.

301
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,853
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

302
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:13,107
If they headed that way, we'll pick up their tracks there.

303
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:15,442
You come prepared.

304
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,985
I'm motivated.

00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:18,737

What do you think?

309
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,691
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

310
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,403
Look at all these side menus here for data entry.

311
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,321
Let's check this one.

Same building, same order every week.

314
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,874
It's a delivery schedule.

315
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,021
What's this?

316
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Drugs?

317
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,443
No. That's a dealer pack.

318
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,445
See, most major players, they weigh their money

319
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,405
so they don't have to constantly count it.

320
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,823
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

321
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,867
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

322
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:50,037
You're saying each one of these shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

Yeah.

That's how he keeps it off the grid.

329

I think it's safe to say that Reyes is smart to want this back.

347
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:13,161
They already know who you are.

348

349
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,250

350

Yeah. I'm good. Thank you.

353

They're going to be looking for the three of us together now.

354
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:23,783
We need to split up.

355

Look how lucky we just got. What happens next time?

359
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,083
We have no choice but to split up.

360

I'm pregnant.

361
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:40,758
I already lost my family once.

362

I'm not going through that again.

364

I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

365
00:35:58,318 --> 00:35:59,401
Dom?

366
00:36:00,403 --> 00:36:02,446
Promise me we stick together.

367
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:12,081
I promise.

368
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,129
Our family just got bigger.

369
00:36:37,232 --> 00:36:38,983
Something doesn't add up.

370
00:36:39,442 --> 00:36:40,943
Toretto and O'Conner.

371
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:46,031
They stay when they're supposed to run, they steal gas then give it away?

372
00:36:46,199 --> 00:36:47,741
Now they're killing federal agents?

373
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:50,536
It doesn't make any sense.

374

Here's what makes sense.

375

All these guys are is names on a list.

Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

381
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:09,388
Prints are all over the car.

382
00:37:09,472 --> 00:37:10,556
Anything else?

383
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,933
Yeah, we tracked the owner off the vehicle ID.

384
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:14,476
There are a couple of shell companies in between,

385
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:17,021
but we finally traced it back to a corporation

386
00:37:17,105 --> 00:37:19,773
owned by an investor down here named Hernan Reyes.

387
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:20,858
Investor?

388
00:37:22,068 --> 00:37:25,321
If there's anything illegal happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

389
00:37:25,405 --> 00:37:27,031
Okay, then so are we.

390
00:37:27,115 --> 00:37:29,325
If he could get us any closer to our guys, I want everything on him.

I want you on overwatch in case somebody comes back for something.

393

Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes, full specs.

394
00:37:35,665 --> 00:37:37,875
If he goes to the john, I want to know how many times he shakes it.

395

You got it, boss. Wilkes, Fusco!

398
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,302
Then you better get started.

399
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,304
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

400
00:37:50,388 --> 00:37:52,181
Let's put it back together and find out what's missing.

Hey, Dom, what do you remember about your father?

403
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:27,383
My father.

404
00:38:31,554 --> 00:38:33,806
He used to...

405
00:38:34,474 --> 00:38:37,851
He used to have a barbecue every Sunday after church.

406
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,896
For anybody in the neighborhood.

407
00:38:41,815 --> 00:38:44,191
If you didn't go to church, you didn't get any barbecue.

408
00:38:46,027 --> 00:38:49,822
Every single day he was in the shop, and every single night,

409
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:54,910
he was at the kitchen table with Mia, helping her with her homework.

410
00:38:56,329 --> 00:38:58,956
Even after she went to sleep,

411
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,084
he'd stay up for a few more hours

412
00:39:02,168 --> 00:39:06,130
so he could learn the next chapter and help her the next day.

413
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:09,091
I remember everything about my father.

414
00:39:10,677 --> 00:39:11,969
Everything.

415
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:14,430
That's just it.

416
00:39:14,806 --> 00:39:16,306
I don't remember shit about my dad.

417
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,478
I don't remember him yelling.

418
00:39:21,563 --> 00:39:23,022
I don't remember him smiling.

419
00:39:25,066 --> 00:39:27,609
To be honest with you, I don't even remember what the hell he looked like.

420
00:39:29,779 --> 00:39:31,905
I don't remember. He just...

421

432
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,010

Yes, we are.

441

I got that.

Yeah, man, why did you drag us halfmay around the world?

505
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:15,939
Because we got a job.

506
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,568
All right, so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

507
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:21,361
And he runs the drug scene down here.

508
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:23,989
He's never been busted because he doesn't leave a paper trail.

509

No paper trail means no banks.

510

And no banks means cash houses.

00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:45,093
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

519
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:47,846
I thought this was business.

520
00:44:48,139 --> 00:44:49,431
Sounds personal to me.

521
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,975

and I know we just met, but you just, kind of, got to...

528
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:17,918
That's right, $100 million, and everything we take,

529
00:45:18,002 --> 00:45:19,419
we split even.

530
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:21,296

01:19:12,663 --> 01:19:14,038
But you do.

994

Real funny.

Your man right there?

1034
01:23:20,119 --> 01:23:22,537
He let off the throttle at the line.

You didn't do nothing. He let you win.

No, it's not stupid at all. I love what I do.

You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

1074

It's going to take a little more than money to learn how to cook.
