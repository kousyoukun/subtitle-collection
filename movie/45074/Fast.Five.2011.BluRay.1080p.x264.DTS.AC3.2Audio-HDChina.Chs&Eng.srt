越狱：

20
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,940
唯一逃逸者：多米尼克・特若图

21
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,450
目前据我们的了解
Here's what we know so far.

22
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,040
这是一起光天化日猖狂越狱案发现场
This is all the aftermath of a daring, daylight breakout.

23
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,210
车内共有二十六名重罪犯
There were 26 high-risk inmates being transferred...

24
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,880
车上所有人员都已归案
where everyone on board has been accounted for,

25
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,670
唯独多米尼克・特若图不见踪影
except for one, Dominic Toretto.

26
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
下午的事故经过精心策划
Police have just released the identity

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,300
未导致任何人员伤亡
of the man they believe to have orchestrated the shocking escape

28
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,050
警方认定劫囚车者身份
that amazingly resulted in no fatalities this afternoon.

29
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,020
他是前联邦调查员布莱恩・欧康纳
He is former federal agent, Brian O'Conner.

30
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,060
今晚注定被这三个逃犯搅得鸡犬不宁
A fierce manhunt is underway for three fugitives tonight.

31
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,980
各级警力加入搜捕队伍
Multiple federal and local agencies have joined forces

32
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,650
搜寻多米尼克・特若图
in the search for Dominic Toretto

33
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,980
和其同伙布莱恩・欧康纳及米亚・特若图
and his accomplices Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto.

34
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,740
尽管举国之力都在尽力搜捕
But despite every eye in the country looking for them

35
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,450
特若图和欧康纳仍下落不明
where Toretto and O'Conner are now is anyone's guess.

36
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,570
是这里没错吧
It's got to be it, right?

37
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,930
我们离开这里
Let's get out of here.

38
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,180
别紧张  伙计们
Easy, friends.

39
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,510
她是自己人
She's with me.

40
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,100
米亚
Mia.

41
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,690
文森
Vince.

42
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
臭小子
Buster.

43
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,860
来吧
Come on.

44
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,780
多姆来了吗
Dom here yet?

45
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,120
没
No.

46
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,870
上次有他消息是什么时候
When was the last time you heard from him?

47
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,040
几星期前  像是在厄瓜多尔
A couple of weeks ago. Up in Ecuador somewhere.

48
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,630
-感觉怎么样  -什么怎么样
- How does it feel? - What's that?

49
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,550
捕人变成被捕
To be on the other side of a wanted poster?

50
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
他会现身的
He'll show up.

51
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,310
多姆的?
Dom's?

52
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,690
小家伙该睡觉了  
Time for bed little one.

53
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,320
我能带他去吗
Can I bring him?

54
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,360
当然
Of course.

55
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,740
晚安
Good night.

56
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,430
不好意思
Excuse me, sorry.

57
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,190
为什么来里约  文森
Why Rio, Vince?

58
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,610
你是说在你把洛杉矶搞得一团糟以后吗
You mean after you screwed everything up in LA?

59
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,860
无奈落脚在南美
Ended up free-falling through South America, you know,

60
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,080
一路躲躲藏藏
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

61
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,620
要不是为罗莎  还得继续逃
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

62
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,310
他知道吗
Does he know?

63
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,940
听着
So, listen.

64
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,240
现在有个活儿
There is a job coming up.

65
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,240
我希望多姆也能在这  但是
I was hoping Dom was going to be here by now

66
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,830
这次很简单  没他也能做
but this one is clean enough we can do it without him.

67
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,130
大买卖  几辆高端车  目标简单
It's a good gig. Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

68
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,170
一个熟人招了些伙计打算干这票
Guy I know is putting together a team to swipe them.

69
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,550
就是还缺几个人手
Just need a few more willing bodies.

70
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,430
我不知道
I don't know.

71
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,180
那批车路过这里
Look, the way the car scene is down here

72
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,220
我们只需快速把它们装卸就能拿大钱
we can unload them quick and get top dollar.

73
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,350
这钱赚的容易
It's easy money.

74
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,690
就我看来
And from where I'm sitting,

75
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,940
你俩都可以捞上一笔
it looks like you both could use the payday.

76
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,650
你在看什么
What are you reading?

77
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,610
旅游指南 
Travel guide.

78
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,230
是吗
Yeah?

79
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,610
东京
Tokyo.

80
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,450
莫斯科
Moscow.

81
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
果阿邦
Goa.

82
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,750
这些地方都什么相同点
You want to know what all of these places have in common?

83
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
什么
Huh?

84
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,420
不能引渡
No extradition.

85
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,890
走啦
Here we go.

86
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,160
借过  伙计
Excuse me, buddy.

87
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,050
好了
Okay.

88
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,990
找到了
Hey, we've found them.

89
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,830
从后面数第二间
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

90
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,840
这是什么
What is it?

91
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,550
药品管理局标签  这车被查封了
DEA tags. These cars have been seized.

92
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,510
看  谁来了
Look who showed up.

93
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,100
天啊  真高兴你没事
God, I'm so happy you're okay.

94
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,600
我告诉你们要低调行事
I thought I told you to lay low.

95
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,230
我弹尽粮绝了  不得不做
Been running on fumes. Had to make a call.

96
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,610
别扯淡了  我们只有两分钟
Hey! Quit talking. We only got the two-minute window.

97
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,070
走  文森
Let's go, Vince.

98
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,660
我要那辆GT40[福特一跑车型号]
I'm taking the GT40.

99
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,780
女士优先
Ladies first.

100
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,750
这车更适合我
This car suits me better.

101
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,090
待会见  宝贝
See you, baby.

102
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,230
没关系  我们都去一个地方
It's okay... we're all going to the same place.

103
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,060
到那儿再把车弄回来
We'll get the car there.

104
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,400
计划有变  等我电话
Change of plans. Wait for my call.

105
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,910
放下去
Let's go!

106
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,380
她去哪
Where is she going?

107
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,850
她要去哪
Where is she going? Hey!

108
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,480
我们被劫了  无论如何别让火车停下来
We're being robbed! Whatever happens, don't stop the train!

109
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,780
快追那女的
Go after the girl!

110
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,490
快
Hurry up!

111
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,100
门禁卡  快拿门禁卡
Access card! Get the access card!

112
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,970
该死
Shit.

113
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,950
多姆  那有个桥
Bridge! There is a bridge!

114
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,640
行李车厢没人
Luggage car is clear.

115
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,690
不许动
Freeze!

116
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,080
该死
Oh, Shit!

117
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,610
不得不干一票  啊
You had to make a call, huh?

118
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,410
什么烂活儿  欧康纳
Shitty call, O'Conner.

119
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,530
烂活儿
Shitty call.

120
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,180
你们今天可惹了不少麻烦
You two stirred up quite a bit of trouble today.

121
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,390
我的人死了三个
Three of my men dead.

122
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,850
三个药品管理局的人也挂了
Three DEA agents along with them.

123
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,860
当然  
Of course,

124
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,070
做生意有得有失
this is business and sometimes things go astray.

125
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,530
我只关心车
All I care about is the car.

126
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,870
告诉我在哪  就放你们走
Tell me where it is, and I'll let you go.

127
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,750
纯属扯淡
This roofing plastic says you're full of shit.

128
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,290
我不知道在你们那里是怎么做生意的
I don't know how you guys do business in your part of the world,

129
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,420
但在里约
but here in Rio,

130
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,130
所有人都清楚他们的对手是谁
I like it when all parties know what they're up against.

131
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,670
好笑 
That's funny.

132
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,300
井水不犯河水
Because it goes both ways.

133
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
那个
You know,

134
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,810
我听说你妹妹很漂亮
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

135
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,690
就算她藏到天涯海角  
Wherever she hides

136
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,360
我也能找到她
I Will find her.

137
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,170
美国逃犯在火车抢劫中
The American fugitives killed

138
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,160
杀了三名药管局官员
three DEA agents during a train robbery...

139
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,160
警方警告市民逃犯带有枪支并极其危险
...Police warn they are armed and extremely dangerous.

140
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,670
任何人有嫌犯任何消息  请及时与警方联系
Anyone with information should contact law enforcement immediately...

141
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,010
米亚
Mia?

142
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,020
你还好吗  
You okay?

143
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,020
还行  你呢
Yeah, you all right?

144
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,780
不愧是特若图家的
Just like a Toretto.

145
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,830
文森呢
Where's Vince?

146
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,750
问得好
That's a good question.

147
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,790
他会来的
He'll be here.

148
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,000
新闻里都是我们的消息
Guys, we're all over the news.

149
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,390
他们把三个药管局官员的死
They're blaming us for the

150
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,460
怪到我们头上
killing of those DEA agents on the train.

151
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,590
我们又成了头号通缉犯
Which means we just jumped to the top of the wanted list.

152
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,220
联邦探子哪儿都是  
The feds have got to show everyone their agents are off limits

153
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,200
他们会派最厉害的人马
and they're going to send their best guys.

154
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,100
我们得离开这里
We got to get out of here.

155
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,430
有件事可以肯定
One thing we know for sure

156
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,520
他们想要这车
is that they wanted this car.

157
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,440
车里有鬼  
Because something is in it.

158
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,190
我们查清楚  就知道对手是谁了
If we find out what it is, we'll know what we're up against.

159
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,430
听着  
All right, listen up!

160
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,340
我们追捕的是专业车手
The men we're after are professional runners.

161
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,080
他们喜欢速度  而且敢铤而走险
They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way

162
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,020
所有要保证弹药充足 
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

163
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,680
找到后一个不落全部带来回
We find them, we take them as a team, and we bring them back.

164
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,270
最重要一点  绝不能让他们弄到车
And above all else, we don't ever, ever let them get into cars.

165
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,940
据事发近10小时了  开始行动
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, men. Let's go hunting.

166
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,190
霍布斯警官  我是警察局长  齐诺・阿米达
Agente Hobbs! Chief of Police, Jono Alemeida.

167
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,440
卢克
Luke.

168
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,740
你手下的殉职  我很遗憾
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

169
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,860
就两个人值得这么大动干戈吗
Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

170
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,490
这两个人来头不小
Let me tell you something about these two men.

171
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,790
一个是前联邦警官  
One is a former federal officer,

172
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,080
做了五年卧底
been in deep cover for five years.

173
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,000
对我们的行动了如指掌
He knows every way you're going to come for him.

174
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,170
另一个是职业罪犯  两次越狱
The other one is a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

175
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,790
大半生都在躲像你我这样的人
spent half his life on the run avoiding folks like you.

176
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,710
如果有什么可以帮忙
Well, if there's anything we can do to help the DSS...

177
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,840
两件事  一  我需要个翻译
Two things. One, I need a translator.

178
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,420
我们公关部有很多...
We have plenty in the public relations department.

179
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,300
埃莉娜・奈维思 
Elena Neves.

180
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,260
-是个巡警吗  -没错
- A patrol officer? - You heard me.

181
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,220
为什么  其他人更有经验
But why? We have many more experienced people.

182
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,310
我喜欢她的笑
I like her smile.

183
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,310
第二件是什么
What's the second thing?

184
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,270
别他妈挡我的道
Stay the fuck out of my way.

185
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,160
布莱恩
Brian. Hm?

186
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,040
我有事要告诉你
I have something I have to tell you.

187
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,790
靠
God damn.

188
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,670
真够乱的
What a mess!

189
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,130
你去哪了  
Where you been, man?

190
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,760
你怎么说话呢
You better check that tone.

191
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,680
你最好快回答我
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

192
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,260
住手  你们两个
Stop it! Both of you.

193
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,730
你去哪了  文森
Where were you, Vince?

194
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,940
贫民窟的混混都在打听你
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

195
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,650
非要弄清你的下落才让我脱身
Couldn't get out of there without leading them straight to you.

196
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,820
弄完了才来
Had to wait them out.

197
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,610
放狗屁  
That is such horseshit

198
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,780
这次你揽的活儿  我们是为你卖命  
That was your job, and those were your guys! Hey!

199
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,450
够了  欧康纳
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

200
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,320
他说没做就没做
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

201
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,490
一边儿待着去
Go walk it off.

202
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,180
我愿意在贵国扩大我公司的业务
Look, I would love to expand my operations into your countries

203
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,260
但老实说  你行事风格太过暴力
but, quite frankly, your business methods are too violent.

204
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,600
我给你讲个故事
Let me tell you a true story.

205
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,110
五百年前  西葡两国殖民者来到这
Five hundred years ago, the Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

206
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,650
都想把这里收入囊中
each trying to get the country from their natives.

207
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,380
西班牙人带着长枪短 
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,

208
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,370
誓要证明谁是老大
determined to prove who was boss.

209
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,000
但全被土著人杀了
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

210
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,840
我个人更欣赏葡萄牙人的方法
Personally, I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

211
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,090
他们奉上礼物
They came bearing gifts.

212
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,470
镜子  剪刀  毛毯
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

213
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,010
一些土著人自己没有的东西
Things that the natives couldn't get on their own,

214
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,600
想用这些东西  
but to continue receiving them,

215
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,350
就得听命于葡萄牙人
they had to work for the Portuguese.

216
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,900
所以现在巴西人都说葡萄牙语
And that's why all Brazilians speak Portuguese today.

217
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,440
如果你想以暴制人
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

218
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,730
最终他们会反抗
they will eventually fight

219
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,780
因为他们没什么输不起的
back because they have nothing to lose.

220
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,490
这是关键
And that's the key.

221
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,370
我去贫民区施舍点东西
I go into the favelas and give them something to lose.

222
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,420
电  自来水  学校教室
Electricity, running water, school rooms for their kids.

223
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,880
让他们尝到了生活的甜头
And for that taste of a better life,

224
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,380
我就控制了他们
I own them.

225
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,590
各位干杯
Gentlemen.

226
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,430
抱歉打扰一下
I apologize for the interruption.

227
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,520
雷耶斯老大  有事跟您报告
Senior Reyes, may I speak with you?

228
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,100
我们找到他们了
We've found them.

229
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,770
失陪一下
Pardon me, gentlemen.

230
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,920
真希望我没看到
Almost wish I didn't see that.

231
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,170
真希望
Almost.

232
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,300
等等  多姆
Wait, Dom.

233
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,550
当时米亚在火车上
Mia was on that train.

234
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,260
我妹在车上
My sister!

235
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,510
我不知道  我不会伤害她
I didn't know. I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

236
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,930
你自己接的生意
You set up the deal!

237
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,640
我以为只是偷车而已
I thought the job was for the cars.

238
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,860
我之前不知道  
I didn't know.

239
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,400
他们只想要芯片
All they want is the chip.

240
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,110
操
Damn!

241
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,400
事先你怎么不说清楚
You should've come clean.

242
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,070
你们在吵什么
What's going on out here?

243
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,160
没什么  
Nothing.

244
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,700
拜托  多姆  把芯片给我  我给他们
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip. I can take this to them.

245
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,960
我拿给雷耶斯  一切都结了
They'll give it to Reyes and set things right.

246
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,040
滚
Get out.

247
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,920
什么
What?

248
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,050
滚
Get out!

249
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,220
你从来不听我的
You never listen to me.

250
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,880
那时我说他是个条子你不信  
Not when I told you he was a cop,

251
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,980
现在还不信我
and not now.

252
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,150
你从不相信我  
You never trust me and

253
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,770
看看我们现在
look where it's gotten us.

254
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,150
看看我们帮派  
Look at our family now.

255
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,710
我有家不能回  
I can't go home!

256
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,280
看你妹妹过的什么日子
Your sister is stuck in this life!

257
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,330
莉迪呢  多姆
Where's Letty, Dom?

258
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,330
莉迪：多姆女友  速4中被毒枭灭口

259
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,830
莉迪呢 
Where's Letty?

260
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,770
离子切割机
Plasma cutter.

261
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,110
威尔克斯  给我一份附近五十英里以内
Wilkes, I want a list of every place within 50 miles

262
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,940
运送压缩气罐的地点名单
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

263
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,150
把证物袋给我
Pass me that manifest.

264
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,830
奈维思警官  怎么才来
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

265
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,290
-是你点名要我  -对
- You asked for me? - I did.

266
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,040
为什么
May I ask why?

267
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,540
我的笑容没那么好看
My smile is not that great.

268
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,680
你丈夫是位警官  在贫民区被枪杀
Your husband was an officer who was gunned down in the favela.

269
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,640
六个月后你振作起来加入了警队
Six months later, you upped and joined the force.

270
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,970
你能保持干劲
You're motivated.

271
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,810
而且 在里约你是绝对不会被收买的人
Plus, I figure you're the only one in Rio who cannot be bought.

272
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,310
我说得对吗
Am I right?

273
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,730
-是的  -当然
- Yes. - Of course I am.

274
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,980
喜忧参半
Good news, bad news.

275
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,730
说来听听
You know I like my dessert first.

276
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,780
我按你说的检查了铁路线
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

277
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860
发现几个他们卸车的痕迹
Found a couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

278
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,650
一条往西
One set of tracks headed west

279
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,410
一直到主道才消失
until it hit the main highway, then disappeared.

280
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,780
另一条往东
But another set of tracks headed east.

281
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,240
轴距一百七十英寸  轮胎印宽半英寸
A 107-inch wheelbase, eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

282
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,910
是GT40吗  从货单上失踪的那辆
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

283
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,580
留了几公里车印  
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

284
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,880
这车很容易留印
Pretty easy in this scrub.

285
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,710
只要走动没法不留痕
Can't move without leaving a sign.

286
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,250
把那该死的痕迹照给我
Give me the damn veggies.

287
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,630
后来车开到硬地  胎印就没了
The ground rolls into a hardpack and we lost that track, too.

288
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,470
也不一定
Not necessarily.

289
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,970
那条路穿过山丘通到贫民区
That road heads up through the hills into the favelas.

290
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,390
几年前被暴雨重开了
Couple of years ago, it was washed out by a storm.

291
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,850
经过那一公里车胎会粘上泥
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

292
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,100
往那边走  就能追踪到他们痕迹了
If they headed that way, we'll pick up their tracks there.

293
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,440
有备而来啊
You come prepared.

294
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,980
我干劲十足
I'm motivated.

295
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,740
好了  
All right, then.

296
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,530
我们这就去找
Let's find ourselves a car.

297
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,190
你觉得怎样
What do you think?

298
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,690
这芯片绝对不简单
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

299
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,400
看边上这些输入数据的菜单
Look at all these side menus here for data entry.

300
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,320
看看这个
Let's check this one.

301
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,950
看  同一幢大楼  每周一单
Look at that. Same building, same order every week.

302
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,870
交易时间表
It's a delivery schedule.

303
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
这是什么
What's this?

304
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
毒品吗  
Drugs?

305
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,440
不  交易量
No. That's a dealer pack.

306
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,440
看  他们用这个货量来算钱
See, most major players, they weigh their money

307
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,400
这样就不用一点点的数了
so they don't have to constantly count it.

308
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,820
那是四十九千克 
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

309
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,870
在二十年代值一百万
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

310
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,030
你是说每批货值一千万
You're saying each one of these shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

311
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,060
这才像话
I thought so.

312
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,110
那是什么 
So what is that?

313
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,820
一亿钞票的金库吗
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

314
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,780
这是查不到的交易凭证
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

315
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,530
雷耶斯不是傻子
I think it's safe to say that Reyes

316
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,910
这东西不能落入他手
is smart to want this back.

317
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,740
芯片上就是他的交易网
It's his whole network right there, just laid out on a chip.

318
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,830
威尔克斯和富斯科去中路
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.

319
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,100
迈克  乔托  从北边上
Mac, Chato, flank north.

320
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,110
我呢
What about me?

321
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,190
待在这
Stay here.

322
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,490
去那边  
Go that way!

323
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,950
另外两个翻墙了
The other two went over the wall!

324
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,410
快  快
Come on, go! Go!

325
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,350
趴下
Get on the ground.

326
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,440
我抓到特若图了  距4个房区...
I got Toretto. Four blocks north of your...

327
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,730
他们知道你们是警察
They already know who you are.

328
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,140
我们走
Let's go.

329
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,020
你还好吗
You okay here?

330
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,780
很好  谢谢
Yeah. I'm good. Thank you.

331
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,310
他们会把我们三个一锅端
They're going to be looking for the three of us together now.

332
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,110
我们得分开走
We need to split up.

333
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,030
你和米亚往南走  我把他们引开
You and Mia head south, I'll lead them away.

334
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,110
不 
No.

335
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,490
多姆说得对
Dom is right.

336
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,280
这次我们侥幸逃脱  那下次呢
Look how lucky we just got. What happens next time?

337
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,410
我们只能分头行动
We have no choice but to split up.

338
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,740
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

339
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,080
我失去过一次亲人
I already lost my family once.

340
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,710
我不想再失去了
I'm not going through that again.

341
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,380
-你开玩笑吗  -不是
- Are you kidding me? - No.

342
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,270
我哪也不去  好吗
I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

343
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,730
多姆 
Dom?

344
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,770
答应我  我们一直在一起
Promise me we stick together.

345
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,410
我答应
I promise.

346
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,460
我们家族要添丁了
Our family just got bigger.

347
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,310
事有蹊跷
Something doesn't add up.

348
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,250
特若图和欧康纳  能走却没走
Toretto and O'Conner. They stay when they're supposed to run,

349
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,360
他们偷了东西  弃之不理
they steal gas then give it away?

350
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,070
还杀了三个联邦官员
Now they're killing federal agents?

351
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,860
没道理
It doesn't make any sense.

352
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,740
道理在这
Here's what makes sense.

353
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,000
这些人都是逃犯
All these guys are is names on a list.

354
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,500
他们一出现  我们就拿下
They come up, we take them down.

355
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,080
不用报告  打光全部子弹
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

356
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,880
威尔克斯  有进展吗
Wilkes, we get anything?

357
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,630
标准取证  
Standard forensics.

358
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,500
鞋印  头发
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

359
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,710
车上尽是指纹
Prints are all over the car.

360
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,880
还有吗
Anything else?

361
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,260
我们根据车的编码查到了用户信息
Yeah, we tracked the owner off the vehicle ID.

362
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,310
几个空壳公司 
There are a couple of shell companies in between,

363
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,440
最后发现这几家公司都属于
but we finally traced it back to

364
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,100
投资人埃尔南・雷耶斯的电力集团
a corporation owned by an investor down here named Hernan Reyes.

365
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,180
投资人
Investor?

366
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,650
里约所有的非法交易  雷耶斯都有份
If there is anything illegal happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

367
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,360
这样我们也要插一脚了
Okay, then so are we.

368
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,830
他和我们有瓜葛了
If he could get us any closer to our guys,

369
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,650
那就查查他
I want everything on him.

370
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,070
乔托  去楼顶守着
Chato, you're on the roof.

371
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,450
防止有人返回报复
I want you on overwatch in case somebody comes back for something.

372
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,910
迈克  跟踪监视雷耶斯
Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes, full specs.

373
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,760
看他见了什么人 
If he goes to the john,

374
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,200
握了几次手
I want to know how many times he shakes it.

375
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,320
知道了头儿  
You got it, boss.

376
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,660
威尔克斯  富斯科
Wilkes, Fusco!

377
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,250
来把这堆废铁组装起来
Let's put all this mess back together.

378
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,290
那得费不少工夫
That's going to take a while.

379
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,630
那就赶紧的吧
Then you better get started.

380
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,630
他们凭白无故不会卸车
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

381
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,510
重新装起来看少了什么
Let's put it back together and find out what's missing.

382
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,540
多姆  你还记得你父亲什么样吗
Hey, Dom, what do you remember about your father?

383
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,710
我父亲
My father.

384
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,130
他以前
He used to...

385
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,180
他以前会每周日做完礼拜后做烧烤
He used to have a barbecue every Sunday after church.

386
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,220
邻里街坊都来吃
For anybody in the neighborhood.

387
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,520
如果我们没去做礼拜  就没烤肉吃
If you didn't go to church, you didn't get any barbecue.

388
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,730
每天白天他都在店里 
Every single day he was in the shop,

389
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,990
每个晚上他都在厨房桌子上
and every single night, he was at the kitchen table with Mia,

390
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,240
辅导米亚做家庭作业
helping her with her homework.

391
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:52,410
就算她睡了  他也会再看几个小时
Even after she went to sleep, he'd stay up for a few more hours

392
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,460
学下一章明天再辅导她
so he could learn the next chapter and help her the next day.

393
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,420
我记得我父亲的所有事
I remember everything about my father.

394
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,290
所有事
Everything.

395
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,760
算了
That's just it.

396
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,630
我一点都不了解我爸
I don't remember shit about my dad.

397
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,800
我不记得他大吼大叫  
I don't remember him yelling.

398
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,350
不记得他的笑容
I don't remember him smiling.

399
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,070
说实话 
To be honest with you,

400
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,940
我都不太记得他长什么样
I don't even remember what the hell he looked like.

401
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,230
我所有的记忆里  
I don't remember. He just...

402
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,440
他总是不在
He was just never there.

403
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,780
你不会像他一样的  布莱恩
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

404
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,550
我们不能逃下去了  多姆
We can't keep running, Dom.

405
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,840
我们得金盆洗手
We got to get out.

406
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,850
立刻马上
We got to get out now.

407
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,390
你说得对
You're right.

408
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,650
我们这么做
Here's how we're going to do it.

409
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,080
用这个东西
We're going to use this.

410
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,080
干上最后一票
We're going do one last job.

411
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,870
搞到雷耶斯所有的钱
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

412
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,750
一个铜板都不剩
Every dime of it,

413
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,340
然后永远
and disappear.

414
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,970
消失
Forever.

415
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,680
新护照
New passports.

416
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,180
新生活   再不东躲西藏
New lives with no more looking over our shoulder.

417
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,930
我们就自由了  
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

418
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,060
没错
That's right.

419
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,810
你想过没
You realize

420
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,140
我们这次是要对抗里约的老大
we're talking about going up against the most powerful guy in all of Rio?

421
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,900
是的  我知道
Yes, we are.

422
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,230
那么就要招兵买马
Then we're going to need a team.

423
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,200
那我们好好想想 都招谁
Let's run through the bases real quick. Who do we got?

424
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,660
首先  一个多面手
First we're going to need a chameleon.

425
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,040
处处深藏不露
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

426
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
还有呢
What else?

427
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,210
大忽悠
A fast talker.

428
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,630
一张嘴走遍天下
Someone who can bullshit their way out of anything.

429
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,050
我认识一个
I got that.

430
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,470
他们有很多监控设备
This guy is going to have a lot of surveillance.

431
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,260
需要一个人搞定这些监控
We're going to need someone who is good with circuits.

432
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,680
除了监控  
And with those circuits,

433
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,970
雷耶斯一定有个保险箱 
Reyes is going to have wells.

434
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,430
还需要人手破解保险箱
We're going to need guys to punch through those walls.

435
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,440
然后呢
What else?

436
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,730
火力掩护
Utilities and weapons.

437
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,570
一个不俱危险的
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

438
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,490
全能型后援
Someone to back up every position.

439
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,110
还需要别的吗
Yeah, what else do we need?

440
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,820
最重要的
Most importantly,

441
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,120
两个稳妥的车手
we're going to need two precision drivers.

442
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,830
关键时刻不会掉链子
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

443
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,370
永不放弃
Guys that never lose.

444
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,960
车手  你我都有数了
You know we got that.

445
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,860
不是吧
Aw, hell, no!

446
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,530
这次还真是兴师动众
I see they really scraped the bottom of the barrel, huh?

447
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,910
你这货都来了  那一定是
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

448
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,710
你打算什么时候把马丁・路德・金的车开回来
When are you going to give Martin Luther King his car back?

449
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,710
马丁・路德・金:为黑人争取平等权利的倡导者

450
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,540
等你拿来瑞克・詹姆斯的夹克再说
As soon as you give Rick James his jacket back.

451
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,540
瑞克・詹姆斯:上世纪七八十年代著名音乐人

452
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,930
过的怎么样  老兄
What's up, man?

453
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,110
长腿妹
Sexy legs, baby girl.

454
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,400
啥时候伺候哥一下
What time do they open?

455
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,070
在我扣下扳机之后
They open the same time as I pull this trigger.

456
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,070
还想让我伺候你吗
Want me to open them?

457
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,330
告诉过你这个美腿妞儿不好惹
I told you the skinny chick had balls.

458
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,960
看起来她已经自己找到乐子了
Looks like she started the party without us.

459
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,170
兄弟  西班牙语怎么骂人
Hey, anybody can talk shit in Spanish, homie.

460
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,090
这哥们说什么呢
What's this guy saying?

461
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,720
长得丑说啥语都没用
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish or in English.

462
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,100
-这两个小丑是谁  -马戏团来的吧  
- Who are these clowns, man? - Circus clowns.

463
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,230
我还以为巴西斗鸡犯法呢
I thought cockfights were illegal in Brazil.

464
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,400
都互相认识了吧
I see you all have met.

465
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,190
你叫我来里约的时候
You know when you called me to come to Rio

466
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,110
我以为是比这更有意思的事儿呢
I assumed it would be for something more exciting than this.

467
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,190
来了伙计
Look at this guy.

468
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,410
-好久不见  -想死你了
- Long time. - I missed you, man.

469
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,570
见到你真好
Good to see you.

470
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,570
兄弟  啥事
Brother. What's up?

471
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,740
认识一下  这是泰基  
Yo, check this out. This is Tej.

472
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,750
东海岸最厉害的万能电工
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

473
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
我的老朋友罗曼・皮尔斯
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

474
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,920
老交情了  我在少管所认识的
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

475
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,630
迈阿密那票就是和他联手干的
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

476
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,130
久仰大名
I've heard about you.

477
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,800
选对人了
Nice digs.

478
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,670
是  没有别人了
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

479
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,970
那现在是什么情况
So what's this all about, Dom?

480
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,390
你折腾我们横跨了半个地球为了什么
Yeah, man, why did you drag us halfway around the world?

481
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,270
有笔买卖
Because we got a job.

482
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,890
目标名叫埃尔南・雷耶斯
All right, so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

483
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,690
这里的毒枭
And he runs the drug scene down here.

484
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,320
他从未落马  因为不留书面字据
He's never been busted because he doesn't leave a paper trail.

485
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,440
那就是说钱不通过银行
No paper trail means no banks.

486
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,610
存在现金仓库里
And no banks means cash houses.

487
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,110
说得对  总共十家金库
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

488
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,370
分散在城内
Spread throughout the city.

489
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,280
我们要把钱都拿走
And we're going to hit them all.

490
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,750
所有吗
All of them?

491
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,250
对
All of them.

492
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,250
太疯狂了  
That sounds crazy.

493
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,290
叫我们来异国他乡
You bring us to a whole other country

494
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,420
还要去抢劫这里的老大
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

495
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,170
我以为只是笔买卖
I thought this was business.

496
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,760
但更像是私人恩怨
Sounds personal to me.

497
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,300
就这事吗
Is that what this is?

498
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,760
我爱你们大家  
I got love for y'all,

499
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,180
但是私人恩怨的生意真的不好做
but personal ain't good business.

500
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,060
我觉得我干不了
I can't do this, homie.

501
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:55,440
这次生意是个一亿美元的大单
So what we're talking about is $100 million.

502
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,570
你说什么
You say what?

503
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,280
你看  我有时候想得比较多
Hundred... See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

504
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,410
可能是  我们刚认识  但是
and I know we just met, but you just, kind of, got to...

505
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,240
对  一亿  拿多少
That's right, $100 million, and everything we take,

506
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,750
就分多少
we split even.

507
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,620
每人一千一百万
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

508
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,000
砸死我吧
I am down.

509
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,500
我加入
I'm in.

510
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,550
一千一百万
Eleven million.

511
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,670
像成千上万女人对我投怀送抱
Sounds like a whole lot of vaginal activity to me.

512
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,430
你不可能同时抢十家
You can't pull off 10 heists on the same mark.

513
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,590
完全没可能
You just can't.

514
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,220
对  我们抢了第一个
As soon as we hit the first one,

515
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,060
他们就会拼命保护其他几个
they're going to do everything they can to protect the rest.

516
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,810
没错
Exactly.

517
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,520
都别动
Nobody move!

518
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,910
都在这了
That's all of it.

519
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,200
你们死定了  
You a dead man.

520
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,370
你们都死定了
You're all dead men!

521
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,700
你们无处可藏
You don't have a place to hide.

522
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,710
谁要藏了
Who's hiding?

523
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,080
你们疯了吗 
Are you crazy?

524
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,380
都疯了吗
Are you crazy?

525
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,040
知道这是谁的地方吗  
Do you know whose house this is?

526
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,340
知道偷的是谁的钱吗
Whose money are you stealing?

527
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,230
我们不偷
We ain't stealing it.

528
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,240
给你老板带个话  告诉他谁干的
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

529
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,370
告诉他这还不算完
Tell him there's more coming.

530
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,040
好啦
Voila.

531
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
发动它
Turn it over.

532
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,380
运转正常  没问题
She's running on all eight. Checks out fine.

533
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,850
接着找
Keep looking.

534
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,440
头儿  如果少了什么东西我们会知道的
Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.

535
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,710
这东西出现在这种跑车上太低级
It's a goddamn shame putting bullshit like that on a classic.

536
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,130
还可以用
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

537
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
他们把芯片拿走了
They took the chip.

538
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,360
警方监视器发现情况
We got a hit on the police scanner.

539
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,230
黎布朗一处仓库发生武装抢劫
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

540
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,740
地址核查得出
Address cross-checks against property

541
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,490
正是雷耶斯公司财产
owned by one of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

542
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,740
好吧  如果是我们追捕的那伙人
All right, if that's our guys

543
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,410
一定是芯片上的内容引导他们去的那里
then whatever was on that chip led them directly to that house.

544
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,660
肯定是他们
It's them, for sure.

545
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,080
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

546
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,460
因为在里约没人傻到去抢雷耶斯
Because no one else in Rio is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

547
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,260
给我解释
Explain.

548
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,020
他们侵入了黎布朗的仓库
They invaded the Leblon house.

549
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,730
谁
Who invaded?

550
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,190
火车上的那些人
The men from the train.

551
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,740
他们拿走多少钱
How much did they take?

552
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,700
一分也没拿
They didn't take anything.

553
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:18,410
他们把钱烧了
They burned it!

554
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,290
他们烧了我的钱
They burned my money?

555
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:23,500
是的  还说这还不算完
Yes. And said there's more coming.

556
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:32,590
好吧
Okay...

557
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,230
那么
Then this...

558
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,560
我们这么做
...is what we're going to do.

559
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,740
清理所有金库
Clean the houses.

560
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,240
我要那笔钱在
I want that money under lock and key...

561
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,790
一小时内锁好
...within an hour.

562
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,080
明白吗
Understand?

563
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,920
明白
Understood.

564
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,310
一号出动了
Number One is on the move, man.

565
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,250
二号上路了

566
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,980
我跟上了
I got mine.

567
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
五号盯上
I got eyes on Five.

568
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,030
你们都说  他会把钱转移到某处
I know y'all said they were consolidating the money somewhere, but,

569
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,250
但是你绝没想到这一点
y'all ain't going to believe this.

570
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,250
警察署

571
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,420
难度增加了
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

572
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:21,930
他既然能把钱放到警察局
If he's moving it into a police station

573
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,470
说明他肯定认识高层人物
he's got some serious brass in his pocket.

574
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,140
看起来我们要提前收场了
Looks like this is going to be a shorter trip than I thought...

575
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,430
太对了  这活儿没法干
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

576
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,020
没法干  或者说不该干
"Can't"'? You mean, "Shouldn't."

577
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,070
我觉得没什么影响
I think this doesn't change a thing.

578
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,490
按计划进行
I say we stick to the plan.

579
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,240
你说什么
You say what?

580
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,990
这破活已经从不可能
This just went from Mission: Impossible

581

变成疯子才去做

582
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,410
随便吧伙计
Whatever, man.

583
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,490
我不是害怕  就是提醒你们一下
I ain't scared, I'm just letting you all know,

584
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,870
进去就是疯子
going in that building is crazy.

585
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,380

587
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,260

11:00.

588
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,010
找到了
Here we go.

589

好啊  王八蛋

和除了航天飞机的一切运输设备
everything short of the goddamn space shuttle.

598
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,720
他们能换个名字  但是换不了脸
They can change their names but they can't change their faces.

599
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,550
他们一定在计划什么
Something big is going down.

600
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,720
这是辆一九七零年的Charger[著名肌肉车]

让城里每双眼睛都找给我找

You know, police stations are designed to keep people in, not out.

635
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,590
所以我们要秘密行动
That's why it's a stealth mission.

636
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,720
没等人反应过来  我们就完活儿了
We'll be in and out before they even know we were there.

637
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,350
我们需要了解那里面的情况
Well, we'll need to get eyes in there.

638
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,890
至少要知道这金库有多大

用绝缘铜芯线抵御高温焊枪
with a insulated copper core to protect against thermal lance.

705
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,590
先进的三级电子锁
A Class-3 electronic lock with a surefire Griffin retumbler

706
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,390
和生物掌纹扫描系统
and a biometric palm scanner.

707
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,970
十倍于顶级线路安全设计
Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

708
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,720
你怎么知道的这么清楚
Do I want to know how you know all that?

709
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,810
谁都有过去  欧康纳
I had a life before you knew me, O'Conner.

710
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,730
这个以后再说
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

711
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,480
她可真漂亮
She is a beauty, though, man.

712
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,730
是褒义的漂亮吗
A "Beauty" As in "Good"?

713
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,570
漂亮的意思是  她很难搞定
"Beauty" As in, she's going to start off playing hard to get.

714
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,030
而且  不管我怎样爱抚她
Then, no matter how much I caress her,

715
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,910
怎样爱她  
no matter how much I love her,

716
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,240
最终还是不会从了我
in the end, she still ain't going to give up that ass.

717
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:50,330
大家都说你炸错了管道
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

718
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,750
你为什么总抱怨呢
Yo, why you got to be so negative all the time, man?

719
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,300
我没啊
I ain't negative.

720
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,170
我就是坚信你会把事情搞糟
I'm just positive you're going to mess it up.

721
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,550
下次如果没有电梯的话我绝对不来
I'm telling you, man, you got issues.

722
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,560
你要学会放松  
You need to learn to relax, loco.

723
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,260
你最好快点  时间不到一分钟了
You better hurry up, we got less than a minute.

724
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:43,300
为什么你总把时间设置的这么短
Why do you always set the timer so short?

725
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,990
希望你知道要往哪走
I hope you know where you're going.

726
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,910
我明白  放松  放松
I got this. Relax, man.

727
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,920
放松
Relax.

728
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,760
警局
...A police station.

729
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,560
放松
Relax.

730
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,200
你炸药又用多了
You used too much explosive! Again.

731
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,950
多少
Too much, too little...

732
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,530
都一样
it's all the same.

733
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,850
这又是你从监狱图书馆
That's some Buddha shit you

734
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:52,040
学的狗屁佛家理论吧
learned from a book in the prison library, isn't it?

735
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,750
你在墙上干的事
And what you're doing there on the wall...

736
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,630
也是从那本书上学的吧
You got that from the same book, huh?

737
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,130
你又抱怨了 
You're so negative, bro.

738
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,320
给个亮
Can I have some light?

739
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,120
收到  收到了
Got it. We got it!

740
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,830
好的  我们收到四个探头的信号
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

741
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,500
又是些高端的光学仪器
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too. Marker optics.

742
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,670
每十秒来回摆动一次 
Hundred-degree field-of-view. Ten seconds oscillation.

743
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,760
不是吧  摆动太快了
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

744
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,510
我们不能用静态图片代替吗
Can't we just tap in and replace the image?

745
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,600
不行  它是和系统同步的
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

746
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,680
肯定会被识别出来
They would know we were in the system.

747
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,810
最好就是一闪而过
The best we can do is peek.

748
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,480
我们得用非常快的车来干这件事
We're going to need some real fast cars to get through this.

749
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,020
而且不只车要快
Not just fast.

750
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,520
还需要高超的驾驶技巧和练习
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

751
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,280
必须开得敏捷又灵活
We're going to need something agile.

752
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,110
你们几个画出一个跑道
You guys mock up a track.

753
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,190
欧康纳  
O'Conner.

754
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,950
咱们去找几辆车
Let's go get some cars.

755
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,870
爽
Nice.

756
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,070
舒服  真舒服
Home sweet home.

757
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,130
那个
Or that.

758
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,510
那辆怎么样  引擎声相当完美
How about that? All motor, no tuning issues.

759
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,930
我一直想要一辆那样的
I always wanted one of those.

760
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,600
恩威达大赛三年的纪录保持者
Held the record on the Avenida three years running.

761
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,100
该死
Damn, bro...

762
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,820
你来这真是自找麻烦  特若图
You got a lot of balls to bring your problems here, Toretto.

763
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,070
还带着个条子
Not to mention a cop.

764
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,360
咱们可以保持低调
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

765
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,410
都说很多人在找你们俩
Word on the street is a lot of people are looking for you two.

766
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,370
啥
What?

767
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,410
你没想过我们会认出你们吗
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

768
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,790
你们有什么车
No, we're kind of counting on it.

769
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,540
那辆小跑可能走街串巷吃得开
That little coupe may run the streets around here,

770
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,090
但是那位大哥还从没看过别的车的尾灯呢
but that monster has never seen a set of tail lights.

771
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,130
马上就会了
Even Well, she's about to.

772
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,350
多米尼克・特若图  来我这赛车了
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

773
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:59,600
那辆车  是辆不错的战利品
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

774
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,940
来吧  传奇
Let's go, legend.

775
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,400
以车赌车
Car for car.

776
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,320
以车赌车
Car for car?

777
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:11,200
想要  就来比比
You want it, come and get it.

778
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,740
大伙瞧瞧
Let's see what they got.

779
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,380
真的假的
Really?

780
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,260
你在哪弄到的  波巴的市场里吗
Where did you get that from? Papa Smurf?

781
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,260
来吧欧康纳  使出你的看家本事
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.

782
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,330
怎么样
How was that one?

783
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,410
探头照到你了
Camera caught you.

784
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,950
-什么  -没错  找到了
- What? - Yeah, it still caught you.

785
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,000
看来我得开得更快才行
Man, I was milking the hell out of that thing, too.

786
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,500
我们需要更快的车
We're going to need a faster car.

787
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,840
我需要那笔钱
I want my money. Come on, man.

788
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,060
来吧  看这个
Let's get it! Watch this.

789
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:31,280
这就能解释你为什么不开车
That's exactly why your ass ain't been driving.

790
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:44,500
我想  我恋爱了
I think I'm in love.

791
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:49,790
技术绝对一流
That was real solid work.

792
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,340
但是三号探头还是抓到你了
I think Camera 3 still caught you, though.

793
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,630
再来一遍
Let's do it again.

794
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,100
这是你订制的存钱罐吗  
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

795
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,100
太搞笑了
You're kidding me. Yep.

796
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,770
你从哪里搞到的
Where in the hell did y'all get one of these?

797
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,280
好吧  谁都有过去
Well, we had a life before you met us.

798
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:17,950
好吧  我来搞定电子锁
All right, I'll get to work on the electronic tumbler

799
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:20,200
但是还有个问题
but there's still another problem.

800
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,200
掌纹扫描系统
Palm scanner.

801
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,080
没有雷耶斯的掌纹
And without Reyes' handprint,

802
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:26,540
胡迪尼[世界最著名魔术师]都打不开
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

803
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,620
你怎么知道一定是雷耶斯本人的掌纹
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

804
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,460
如果里面的一亿美元是你的
You got $100 million in a safe.

805
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,250
你会用别人的掌纹来做密码吗
You going to put somebody else's handprint on it?

806
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,760
这玩意要弄死你了
That shit is eating you alive.

807
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,090
试试
You check that.

808
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,220
-试试  -闭嘴
- Yo, check that. - Shut up!

809
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,390
我们怎么搞到雷耶斯的掌纹
How are we supposed to get Reyes' handprint?

810
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,220
韩
Han.

811
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,310
你来
You're up.

812
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:51,150
没问题  小事一桩
Sure. Nothing like the easy stuff.

813
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,730
我也去  我开车
Let's go. I'll drive.

814
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:14,170
-有六个保镖  -七个
- I make six bodyguards. - Seven.

815
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,130
你觉得那个一脸怪相的人是游客吗
You think that guy with a fanny pack is a tourist?

816
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,640
你在军队待了多久
So, how long were you in the army?

817
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,520
你那天用的Jericho 941[手枪型号]
That gun you pulled the other day was a Jericho 941.

818
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,600
快速上膛
Thumb-racking the slide?

819
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,520
摩萨德[以色列情报和特殊使命局]的招式
That was straight-up Mossad.

820
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,650
你戒烟的时候
I got out of the military

821
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,820
我就退伍了
probably the same time you quit smoking.

822
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,870
你吃那么多薯片
The amount of chips you eat,

823
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,410
嘴还闲不住是吗
the way you always have to keep your hands and mouth busy,

824
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,080
你以前一天肯定抽两包
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

825
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,790
无滤嘴的
Unfiltered.

826
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,880
这次没戏
Well, this is a bust.

827
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:02,430
拿不到雷耶斯的掌纹
We're not going to be able to get his fingerprints out here.

828
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:05,550
还得多做点侦察  再找几个帮手
We need to do some more recon, call in a couple of extra guys.

829
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,890
或者
Or

830
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,520
有些事儿注定要女人来做
you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

831
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:10,540
我们能搞定  我保证
We're going to figure this out, I promise you.

832
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,120
怎么了
What's up?

833
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,290
原来你也不是什么正人君子
I thought you were more of a thong man.

834
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,710
弄到掌纹了
We got the print.

835
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,590
在哪
Where?

836
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,550
这太扯了
Okay, that's crazy.

837
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:32,770
他就拍了一下你的屁股  还是整个抓住
So, did he just slap that ass or did he grab and hold on to it?

838
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,400
这个能用
Hey, this will work.

839
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,270
我看好你哦
I'm impressed.

840
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,360
-行吗  -可以
- Got it? - Got it.

841
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,150
可你还没回答呢
But you still didn't answer the question.

842
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,580
伙计们  有麻烦了
Oh, no. Guys, guys! Guys, we have a problem.

843
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,910
我们都暴露了
The whole team just got burnt.

844
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,170
我们被通缉了
Now we're all wanted.

845
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,340
怎么会
How did this happen?

846
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,090
美国外交安全局已经授权
US Diplomatic Security Service issued the warrants.

847
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:06,010
霍布斯探员
Agent L. Hobbs.

848
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,380
等等
Hold on one second.

849
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,550
多姆
Hey, Dom.

850
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,020
这人是你在贫民区见过的那个吗
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

851
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:16,980
是的
Yeah.

852
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:20,810
霍布斯是Dss精英特遣队长
Hobbs is the leader of the elite task force for the DSS.

853
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,020
就是说  他很厉害吗
So he's good.

854
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,190
FBI想抓人的时候就派他出马
When the FBI wants to find somebody, that's who they call.

855
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,030
因为他从未失手
Because he never misses his mark.

856
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:29,990
这家伙是个传奇人物
This guy is Old Testament.

857
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,370
铁血硬汉是他的一贯作风
Blood, bullets, wrath of God. That's his style.

858
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,160
而且此时此刻他正在找我们
And right now he's hunting us?

859
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,960
多姆  我们得加快进度了
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

860
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,170
好的  但是怎么来
Yeah, but how?

861
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,540
这件事已经很困难了
This thing's already been

862
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,710
如果他再掺合进来
difficult without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

863
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,050
我们需要更多的喘息空间
If anything, we need more room to breathe.

864
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,760
罗曼说的没错
Roman's right.

865
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,060
我们出去透透气
Think we need to get some fresh air.

866
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,060
找到了  70年代的Charger
We've got a hit. '70s Charger.

867
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,150
出发
Let's get a move on!

868
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,150
向安维尼迪拉卡街区东部行驶
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

869
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,660
快快快
Move, move, move, move!

870
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,580
他在前面一个街区停下了  
It stopped about a block ahead.

871
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,670
停车  我们步行过去
Park it. We're going on foot.

872
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,110
特若图
Hey, Toretto.

873
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,820
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

874
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,280
被捕?
Arrest?

875
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:58,370
我看不是吧
I don't feel like I'm under arrest.

876
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,370
你觉得呢布莱恩
How about you, Brian?

877
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,620
不  没有
No, not a bit.

878
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,840
一点都没有
Not even a little bit.

879
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,170
我给你们一分钟  看能不能想明白
Just give it a minute. It'll sink in.

880
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,050
我们没杀那些联邦探员  雷耶斯干的
We didn't kill those feds. That was Reyes.

881
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,430
我不管这个
I don't give a shit.

882
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:17,310
我听命抓两个混蛋归案
I'm just here to bring in two assholes whose names hit my desk.

883
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,810
听起来像真英雄
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

884
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,400
真搞笑
That's funny.

885
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,950
这话出自一个警察
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,

886
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,570
他忘掉先前的誓言
then went against everything it stood for.

887
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,400
一个硬汉
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

888
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,860
原来用电棍惩治恶徒
who beat a man half to death with a socket wrench.

889
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:34,820
还真是条好汉
Yeah, real tough.

890
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,990
现在转身双手放在背后
You turn around and put your hands behind your back.

891
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,580
我不会这么做
I don't think so.

892
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:44,290
小子  你以为自己有的选吗
Your mistake is thinking you got a goddamn choice, boy.

893
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,050
你搞错了把
And your mistake?

894
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:52,170
还以为自己在美国啊
Thinking you're in America.

895
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,850
你离家可远着呢
You're a long way from home.

896
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,850
这是巴西
This is Brazil.

897
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,330
算了  头儿  改天吧
Come on, boss. Another day.

898
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,500
算了  今天不是时候
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

899
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:33,050
后会有期  特若图
I'll see you soon, Toretto.

900
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:36,970
随时奉陪
I look forward to it, cop.

901
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,260
好了
Yep.

902
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,720
追踪器装好了
Tracker's on.

903
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,090
找到了
Got them.

904
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,700
我不明白  来干什么
I don't understand. Why come here?

905
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:31,040
为了一个二十美元的银饰值得吗
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

906
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,880
它值得
Because it's worth it.

907
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,220
你该逃走
You should run, you know.

908
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,390
霍布斯会抓到你的
Hobbs will find you.

909
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,020
你有一万个理由离开  为什么不呢
You have every reason to leave. Why stay?

910
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,530
你又是为什么呢
Why do you?

911
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,070
我丈夫是个好警员...
My husband was a good police officer.

912
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,530
老实人...
An honest man.

913
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,660
我们青梅竹马
We both grew up here.

914
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,960
两年前  他在街上被谋杀了
Two years ago he was murdered in the street

915
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,790
就在我们家门外
right outside our door.

916
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:19,050
这里是雷耶斯的地盘  他给大家东西
Reyes owns this favela now. He gives things to people.

917
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,680
而东西不是白给的
But everything has a price.

918
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:28,140
这里的人们需要一个新的开始
The people here need a new start.

919
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,230
需要自由
They need to be free.

920
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,740
火车上那些人不是你杀的  
You didn't kill those men in the train,

921
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,700
对吗
did you?

922
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,040
你现在怎么又相信我了呢
Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you?

923
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,300
她对你来说真的那么特别吗
Was she so special to you?

924
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,430
我以为没有人能够理解
I never thought anyone could understand now much.

925
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,270
但是你懂我了
But you do.

926
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,970
差不多  但还不够好
Close, but not enough.

927
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,100
伙计  时间太短了
Dom, the window is too small, man.

928
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,940
唯一能躲过摄像头的办法就是用隐形车了
Only way we're going to beat the cameras is with invisible cars.

929
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:04,030
我正好知道这么个地方
And I know just where to get them.

930
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,450
伙计们  出去兜个风吧
Let's take a ride, boys.

931
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,380
别伤着自己
Don't hurt yourself.

932
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:37,850
我已经好久没有 
It's been a while since

933
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:39,400
驾驶过警车了
I've been behind the wheel of one of these.

934
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:41,610
我也是第一次坐警车前座
First time I've ever been in the front seat.

935
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,910
罗曼  怎么耽搁这么久
Rome, what took you so long?

936
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,630
我刚打包票你一定会
I thought for sure you'd be

937
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:55,120
装个铬纺轮还是什么登场的
showing up with some chrome spinners or something.

938
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,210
真搞笑
Real funny.

939
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,990
我赌十万美金
I got $100,000 that says

940
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,340
我比你们都先到下下个路口
I can take you all in the next quarter-mile.

941
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,960
你说的像真有十万块似的
Yeah, your broke ass has got a hundred grand.

942
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:06,380
如果我们这次干成了  我就有了
If we pull off this job, I will.

943
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,220
下两个红绿灯  
The next two lights.

944
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,680
十万块
Hundred thousand.

945
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,430
如果我们这次干砸了  反正也死翘翘了
We don't pull this job off, we're probably dead anyway.

946
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:16,020
我们赌一百万吧
Let's make it a million.

947
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,230
我赞成  一百万赌四分之一英里
I like that. All right, a million-dollar quarter-mile.

948
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,020
好的  
All right, then.

949
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:24,860
人生只有一次 来吧
You only live once. Let's do it.

950
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,400
多姆  你说呢
What do you say, Dom?

951
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,530
到底要聊天呢还是要赛车
We talking or we racing?

952
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,070
这次别作弊了啊
Just don't cheat this time.

953
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,330
你就是不能忘了这茬
Got to let that go.

954
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:58,560
还是老样子  罗曼
Typical, Roman.

955
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,100
我需要这笔钱  我赢定了
I'm going to get this money. I'm hungry.

956
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,070
别让我赢得太容易  伙计们
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

957
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:14,910
没门
No!

958
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,870
那可没准  多姆
Not this time, Dom.

959
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,460
加把劲儿  布莱恩
You got to want it, Brian.

960
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:56,490
我赢了  赢了
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

961
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,550
-开得不错  欧康纳  -承让 
- Good race, O'Conner. - Thanks, Dom.

962
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:18,310
你们知道我等这天多久了吗
Do you know how long I've been waiting for that shit?

963
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,350
我就说  他没看出来吧
I told you he didn't see it.

964
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,270
你没看出来吗
Your man right there?

965
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,770
他最后关头松了油门
He let off the throttle at the line.

966
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:27,560
你没赢  他让你的
You didn't do nothing. He let you win.

967
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,230
胡扯
Bullshit.

968
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:54,170
-文森  你要做什么 -别说话  有人跟踪
- Vince, what are you doing? - Quiet! They've been tracking you.

969
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:03,890
我知道那个女的在这
I know she's here!

970
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:07,560
去找
Find her!

971
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:09,270
快去
Go!Go!Go!

972
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,330
没事  等等
It's okay. Wait!

973
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:28,460
雷耶斯的人在市场埋伏我
Reyes' guys were waiting for me at the market.

974
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,040
文森救了我
Vince saved my life.

975
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,930
饿不饿
You hungry?

976
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,520
-正好饿了  -不错
- Yeah, sure. - Good.

977
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,480
今天还算客气
Because you're saying grace.

978
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:51,110
谢了  文森
Thanks, Vince.

979
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,320
你把它烤焦了
Yo, you burned it!

980
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:02,370
我妈就这么弄  放松
Yo, this is how my momma does it. Relax.

981
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:04,790
是的  但是你妈是世上最差的厨子
Yeah, but your mom is the worst cook in the world.

982
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:07,750
不许说我老妈
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

983
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,420
干一个  生活不错
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

984
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,630
干杯  干杯  干杯
To you, bro. Cheers, cheers, cheers.

985
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,970
我们在巴西  活的还不错
So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

986
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:21,930
你有  有了一千还是一千一百多万后
So, you got a little more than $10 or $11 million coming.

987
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:23,140
打算怎么花
What you going to do with your money?

988
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,890
-我吗 -是的
- Me? - Yeah.

989
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:25,850
事实上  我一直想着
Actually, man, I been

990
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:27,730
回家开一个修车厂
thinking about opening up a garage back home.

991
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:30,080
顾客把车开来 
Place where people can bring their cars and

992
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,480
只赚一点点就好
not get completely ripped off.

993
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,690
你明白不
You know what I mean?

994
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,110
-真的吗 -是的
- Really? - Yeah.

995
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:37,070
那么  你的梦想就是白天干活
So, your dream is to start a day job?

996
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:39,320
这  这真蠢  伙计  为什么
That's stupid. Like, why would...

997
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,990
不...这一点也不蠢  我喜欢干这个
No, it's not stupid at all. I love what I do.

998
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,070
那有啥意思
That don't make no sense to me.

999
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,990
你们想知道我怎么花吗
I know what I'm going to do with my money.

1000
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,910
为我男人找个厨师班
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

1001
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,880
看到没  
See? See?

1002
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,250
你又开始抱怨这个了
There you go with that negativity, man.

1003
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,380
你了解我  我不在乎钱
You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

1004
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,010
光交学费  学不会做饭
It's going to take a little more than money to learn how to cook.

1005
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:00,340
那真糟糕
That's horrible.

1006
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,420
我听说动物收容所
But I heard they was looking

1007
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:04,550
正在找个厨子
for a chef down at this animal shelter.

1008
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,720
你想不想
You might want to...

1009
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,520
我认识经理
I know the manager.

1010
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,610
你好  多姆
Hey, Dom.

1011
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,820
听着  
Listen.

1012
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:23,280
我知道你明天要干一票
I know that you're all set for this job tomorrow,

1013
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,120
如果还缺人手
but if you need an extra man, I could...

1014
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,530
麦克  你也有份
You're in.

1015
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,500
一家人不说两家话
There's always room for family.

1016
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,010
谢谢
Thank you.

1017
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,720
吃点东西去
Get something to eat.

1018
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,140
好
Yeah.

1019
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,730
米亚称它为诅咒
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

1020
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,700
她或许是对的
She might be right.

1021
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:09,490
你真的挺喜欢做这个的
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

1022
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,300
生死攸关之时
When your life is on the line

1023
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,000
只能靠自己
that's when you learn about yourself.

1024
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,710
这是个公平交易
That's a fair deal.

1025
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,530
距离我们人生最大的庆祝
We're less than 24 hours

1026
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:28,140
不到二十四小时了
from the biggest celebration of our life.

1027
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,520
你们得充充电  这是很严肃的事
Y'all need a refill. This is serious stuff.

1028
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,890
-不了  -喝一个
- No, I'm good. - Cheers, baby.

1029
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,600
不  不用了  不了  谢谢
I'm good. No, thank you.

1030
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:34,690
不  她不能喝
No, she can't.

1031
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,940
什么意思  她不能喝
What do you mean? She can't.

1032
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:41,940
什么意思  她不能喝
What do you mean she can't? What is...

1033
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:48,370
你不是在开玩笑吧
Are you serious right now?

1034
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:52,160
这就是你让他跑赢你的原因吗
Is that the reason you let him beat you in the quarter-mile?

1035
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,750
-是给宝宝的礼物  -才不是
- That was a baby gift. - No, that's messed up.

1036
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:58,420
你说什么都是我赢了
No, you're not taking that from me.

1037
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,130
等等  等等  等一下
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

1038
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:04,510
他是拍了一下你的屁股  还是整个抓住
So, did he just smack the ass or did he grab and hold on to it?

1039
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,880
哪一种
Which One was it?

1040
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,470
-恭喜  -谢谢
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1041
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,390
为什么藏着不告诉我们
How can you keep this a secret?

1042
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,470
你小子都有儿子了
Crazy, huh?  It's your boy.

1043
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,270
给宝宝的礼物
Baby gift, huh?

1044
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:21,360
我不知道他们在说什么
I have no idea what they're talking about.

1045
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,570
致敬
Toast

1046
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:39,170
钱财乃身外之物
Money will come and go. We know that.

1047
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:41,550
生命中最宝贵永远是
But the most important thing

1048
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,670
这个房间里的你们
in life will always be the people in this room.

1049
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:46,340
此时
Right here.

1050
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,010
此地
Right now.

1051
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:06,190
我准备好了
I'm all set.

1052
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,200
桑托斯  都好了吗
Yo, Santos. Van good?

1053
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,490
是的  我随时就绪  兄弟
You know we're always good, bro.

1054
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:20,120
霍布斯他们在城市另一头
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

1055
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:22,790
这是最佳时机
We're not going to get a better window.

1056
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,130
来吧  伙计们  该我们上场了
Okay, guys, it's show time!

1057
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:26,800
第一队就位  出发
First team in position, let's go.

1058
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,130
快点  出发
Come on, let's do this.

1059
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,440
多姆  
Hey, Dom.

1060
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,400
我会照顾米亚的
I got eyes on Mia.

1061
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,490
莫斯科  巴厘  果阿邦  香港
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

1062
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,990
他们有什么共同点
And what do they all have in common?

1063
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,160
不能引渡
No extradition.

1064
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,000
我们还有一小时就可以去了
We're one hour away from the rest of our lives.

1065
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,090
警察
Cops!

1066
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,050
快点  跑
Come on. Go.

1067
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,270
你刚真是大错特错了
You just made a big mistake.

1068
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:25,690
找到追踪芯片是费了我点时间
Took me a while to find that tracking chip.

1069
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,570
但是  找接收器可不用那么久
But not as long to flip the receiver.

1070
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,150
特若图  你完了
You're going down, Toretto.

1071
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:31,280
老子奉陪到底
I'm right here.

1072
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:01,410
-多姆  退后 -我来搞定
- Dom! Stand back. - I got this.

1073
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:11,250
-住手  -多姆  住手
- Pull off! - Dom! Please, stop!

1074
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,890
多姆  
Dom!

1075
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,400
多姆  
Dom!

1076
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,300
我们正在回来的路上
We're coming in now.

1077
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,550
派警队去机场接我们
Have the marshals meet us at the airport when we land.

1078
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,810
有埋伏
Ambush!

1079
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:09,660
威尔克斯  反击  搞定他们
Wilkes, suppression fire. Shut them down.

1080
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,540
掩护我
Stagger-step. Cover me.

1081
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:21,590
看着那边
Watch them!

1082
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,270
放开我们 
Cut us loose!

1083
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,360
快点  放开我们
Come on! Cut us loose!

1084
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:36,190
-都上来了吗  -开车
- We're good? - Yeah, let's go, let's go!

1085
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:11,100
多姆
Hey, Dom.

1086
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,520
你还没见过我儿子
You've got to meet my son.

1087
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,560
尼克
Nico.

1088
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,780
我会见到的
I will.

1089
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,950
他是个好孩子
He's a good kid.

1090
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,410
我们用你的名字给他命名的
You know, we named him after you.

1091
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:41,540
多米尼克
"Dominic."

1092
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,800
我向你保证  文森
You've got my word, Vince.

1093
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:59,440
你一直是我的兄弟
You were always my brother.

1094
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:11,570
我帮你养儿子
I got eyes on Nico now.

1095
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,670
我们得走了  没有多少时间了
We need to move. We don't have that much time.

1096
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:25,880
我订了趟航班跑路
I got us a flight out.

1097
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,550
五小时后离开里约热内卢
We can leave Rio in the rearview in the next five hours.

1098
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:30,420
不是逃跑
Not to run away.

1099
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,430
而是完成计划
To finish the job.

1100
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,680
多姆  你疯了吗  我们办不到
Are you crazy, Dom? We can't.

1101
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:38,850
这无疑是在自杀
It's a suicide mission.

1102
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:41,600
你兄弟还躺在那里尸骨未寒
That's your man over there on the table.

1103
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:45,020
计划破产了 
The plan is busted!

1104
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:47,820
都是胡扯  雷耶斯知道我们要去
This is bullshit, man. Reyes knows we're coming!

1105
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,280
他说的对
He's right.

1106
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:52,360
他们增派了三倍的人手在警察局
They tripled the detail at the police station.

1107
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,030
这将是一场血战
it's going to be a wall of gunfire.

1108
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,330
不能轻易饶了雷耶斯
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

1109
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:00,620
这是个陷阱  伙计  
It's a trap, man.

1110
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,120
你早知道
You know that.

1111
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:05,130
多姆  听他们的吧
Dom, listen to them.

1112
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:08,380
趁还有机会  逃吧  离开里约  
Run, before it's too late. Leave Rio.

1113
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,090
你就自由了
You can be free.

1114
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:15,260
逃跑不会自由
Running ain't freedom.

1115
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,140
你应该明白的
You should know that.

1116
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,650
你们自己有权决定去留
You know you're all free to make your own choices.

1117
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:30,990
我入伙
I'm in.

1118
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:42,000
特若图  我和你一起去
I'll ride with you, Toretto.

1119
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:47,840
最起码杀了那个狗娘养的
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

1120
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,850
多姆  那计划是什么
So what's the plan, Dom?

1121
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,720
想藏也藏不住了
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

1122
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:04,180
我们不藏
We don't sneak.

1123
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:08,110
他唯一在意的就是他的钱
The only thing he cares about is his money.

1124
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,690
我们控制了钱
We pull that,

1125
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:12,110
也就控制了他
we pull him.

1126
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,540
看到了吗
See?

1127
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:34,380
全部警员出动
I called in every cop on our payroll.

1128
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,680
万无一失
We're covered.

1129
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,800
每个入口都有人守卫
We've got every entrance covered with weapons teams.

1130
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:43,640
即使上帝也不可能拿走您的钱
God Himself couldn't get at your money if He wanted to.

1131
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:48,480
我可不担心上帝
God isn't my worry.

1132
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,240
准备好了吗
You ready?

1133
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:02,530
准备好了
I'm ready.

1134
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,010
发生什么事了
What's happening?

1135
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:03,550
他们来打劫了
They're taking the vault!

1136
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,310
-什么  -金库
- What? - The vault!

1137
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:18,110
跟我来  快点
Follow me! Quickly!

1138
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:23,950
让我过去
Let me through!

1139
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
不许动
Don't move!

1140
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:37,590
趴下
Stay down.

1141
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:08,950
米亚  路况
Call it out, Mia!

1142
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,540
直走  两个街区
You've got a straight shot for two blocks.

1143
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,540
-右转  -好
- Go right.- Got it.

1144
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:37,520
不出意料
Well, the plan is working.

1145
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,780
里约所有的警车都在追你们 
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio on your tail.

1146
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,490
你们得跑快一点
You have to move fast.

1147
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:43,650
最佳落点在哪里
What's the best route?

1148
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:46,990
向前行驶半英里到的卢福
Okay, keep going straight another half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

1149
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,990
然后左转
and then go left.

1150
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:53,790
行不通
That ain't going to work.

1151
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,460
多姆  前面有钉子  有钉子
Spikes ahead, Dom. We got spikes!

1152
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,460
往右开
We're going right!

1153
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,130
不行  太挤了  过不去
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

1154
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:03,670
没选择了  立刻
We've got no choice. Now!

1155
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,530
狗屎
Shit!

1156
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,450
真要命
Holy shit!

1157
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,130
伙计们  我都听到动静了
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.

1158
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:35,410
你们把银行拖出来了啊
Did you just take out a bank?

1159
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:45,470
来了两辆
Two inbound!

1160
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,340
好的  你们左侧有个巷子
All right, there's an alley coming up on your left.

1161
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:51,100
好的  知道了
Yeah, I got it.

1162
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,110
王八蛋
You little bastard!

1163
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,970
不错  多姆  这里右转
All right, good job, Dom. Right-hander, right here, right-hander.

1164
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:20,390
南边追过去一大队人马
Guys, there's a big group coming at you from the south.

1165
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,270
你们想想办法
You have to do something now!

1166
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:26,190
分开两侧
Hey, go wide.

1167
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,130
左侧障碍清除
You're all clear on the left.

1168
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:17,050
下午好  警官
Good afternoon, officer!

1169
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:21,470
请您出示驾照
License and registration, please!

1170
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:30,570
帅呆了
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!

1171
01:47:30,650 --> 01:47:32,070
右侧障碍清除
We're clear on the right.

1172
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,400
厉害
Oh, man.

1173
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,240
谢谢伙计们  
Thanks, guys.

1174
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:42,740
随叫随到
Any time.

1175
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,620
一会儿见
I'll see you on the other side.

1176
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,000
你们只有十秒钟 
You guys just carved out a 10-second window.

1177
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,540
抓紧时间
Make it count!

1178
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,050
齐齐  跟紧他们
Zizi, stay on them.

1179
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,500
在桥上他们甩不掉我们的
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

1180
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:28,460
该死
Shit.

1181
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,760
无路可逃吧
They have no way out.

1182
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:39,760
不
No!

1183
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:41,680
他们人太多了
There's too many of them.

1184
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,720
我们没办法甩掉的
Hey, there's too many of them. We're not going to make it.

1185
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:48,440
是的  我们甩不掉
You're right, we aren't.

1186
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:50,690
甩掉你可以  
You are.

1187
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:52,060
什么意思
What are you talking about?

1188
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:54,690
甩掉金库  离开那里
Just let the vault go. Get out of there.

1189
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:56,480
布莱恩  你是有孩子的人了
You're a father now, Brian.

1190
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:58,740
我不会丢下你的  你按计划来
No, I'm not leaving you. Now you stick with the plan!

1191
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:00,820
计划本来就如此
It was always the plan.

1192
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:02,870
照顾好米亚
Take care of Mia.

1193
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:05,370
多姆  你现在听我说
Dom, you listen to me now. Okay?

1194
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:07,290
立刻切断绳索
You cut loose right now.

1195
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:25,680
他要干什么
Hey, what is he doing?

1196
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:30,770
我们要抓到他了
We've got him!

1197
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:48,870
封闭大桥
Close down the bridge!

1198
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:24,490
想想办法  混蛋
Do something, asshole!

1199
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:37,710
杀掉他  妈的
Kill him, dammit!

1200
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,560
干掉他  快点
Kill him now!

1201
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,960
不是让你别回头吗
I thought I told you to go on.

1202
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:09,140
没错  但我的干完这笔
Yeah, I had to make a call.

1203
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,150
救我
Help me.

1204
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:32,530
狗杂种  这枪是为了我兄弟们
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

1205
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:38,420
简直一团糟啊
It's a hell of a mess.

1206
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,750
是的
Yeah, it is.

1207
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:44,000
我不可能放你们走
You know I can't let you two go.

1208
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,090
这与我的职责不符
I ain't made that way.

1209
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:51,510
我给你二十四小时的时间
The way I see it, you've earned yourselves 24 hours.

1210
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:53,680
但是钱要留下
The money stays, though.

1211
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:57,180
如果我是你  我会好好利用这个时间
If I were you, I'd use the time.

1212
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,520
把该处理的事情都处理好
Make peace with whatever demons you got left.

1213
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:06,860
到了明天  
Because come tomorrow,

1214
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,360
我就去抓你们
I will find you.

1215
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:22,500
特若图
Toretto!

1216
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:24,710
后会有期
I'll see you soon.

1217
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:29,420
不  后会无期
No, you won't.

1218
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:11,970
谢啦  伙计们
Thanks, guys.

1219
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:13,550
一会见
I'll see you on the other side.

1220
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:20,890
你们只有十秒钟
You guys just carved out a 10 second window.

1221
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:22,270
抓紧时间
Make it count!

1222
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:06,400
拜托  宝贝  
Come on, baby.

1223
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,360
别为难我
Don't be mean.

1224
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:11,610
拜托
Come on.

1225
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:24,710
给罗莎和尼克  再见  多姆叔叔
For Rosa and Nico. See you soon,

1226
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:40,820
你确定要这么做吗
You sure about this?

1227
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:44,080
你知道的  当然
You know I am.

1228
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,500
你不必如此的
You don't need to do this.

1229
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:50,830
别烦我了
Just leave me alone.

1230
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,960
伙计  我不是反对你  
Bro, I'm not trying to be negative, but casinos

1231
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:54,040
只是赌场
are the kinds of places

1232
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,880
就是专门坑我们这种人的地方
designed to take money from guys like you and me.

1233
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:57,470
等我赢了
When I win here I'm buying

1234
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:59,720
给你够吃一辈子的抗抑郁药
you a lifetime supply of antidepressants.

1235
01:57:00,010 --> 01:57:03,010
不要把一千万都押红色
You don't put ten million on red!

1236
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:04,060
够了
Enough already.

1237
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:05,520
押黑色
You put it on black.

1238
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,230
停止下注
No more bets.

1239
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:37,460
这边  甜心
Right this way, my dear.

1240
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:41,340
待在这里  我马上回来
You stay right here, I'll be right back.

1241
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:45,350
这就是你的梦想了啊
So, this is your dream, huh?

1242
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:46,720
这对我足够了
It's enough for me, man.

1243
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:48,220
看来你也实现梦想了
I take it that's your dream.

1244
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:50,890
当然  怎么样...
Absolutely. What up, boy? What's going on?

1245
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,770
-你不错啊  -是的  
- You good? - Yes, yes.

1246
01:57:52,850 --> 01:57:54,060
你知道多疯狂吗
You know what's crazy?

1247
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:56,730
这车全球只有四辆
There's only four of those cars in the whole world.

1248
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,690
我拥有西半球唯一的一辆
Yeah, I got the only one in the Western Hemisphere.

1249
01:58:00,190 --> 01:58:04,490
我给了阿布扎比酋长一个无法拒绝的高价
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi an offer he could not refuse.

1250
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:07,080
那个姑娘也不错
Huh. That's a nice lady you got there, too.

1251
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:10,580
那是当然
Absolutely. What's happening?

1252
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:13,580
伙计  我们要出发了  走吧
We got to go, man. Let's do this.

1253
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:15,330
好的  我要开车
Okay, I'll drive.

1254
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:17,960
这个吗  拜托 伙计 别...没门
In that? Come on, man, no way.

1255
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:20,340
不  不是这个  
No, no. Not in this.

1256
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:21,590
那个
In that.

1257
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:29,470
你不是在开玩笑吧
Are you serious right now?

1258
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,600
伙计  这太疯狂了
