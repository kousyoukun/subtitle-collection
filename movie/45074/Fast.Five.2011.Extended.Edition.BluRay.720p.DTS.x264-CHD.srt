A daring midday breakout where everyone onboard has been accounted for,

14
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,759
除了多米尼克・托雷多

25
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:41,494
但是他们的行踪依然成谜
where Toretto and O'Conner are now is anyone's guess.

26
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,572
一定是这里,对吧?

感觉如何?
How does it feel? 

38
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:57,630
什么意思?,
What's that?

39
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:01,593
从警探变成通缉犯?
To be on the other side of a wanted poster?

40
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,762
他会露面的 
He'll show up.

41
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,139
是啊
Yeah.

42
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,312
多姆的朋友?
Dom's?

43
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,106
是的
Yeah.

44
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,945
该睡了,小乖乖

不好意思
Excuse me, sorry.

49
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,314
为什么在里约落脚,文斯?
Why Rio, Vince?

50
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,654
你是说你在洛杉矶把我们害惨以后?
You mean after you screwed everything up in LA?

51
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,825
我在南美洲一边逃亡...
Ended up free-falling through South America, you know,

52
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,995
一边苟延残喘...
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

53
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:14,666
要不是遇到萝莎我还会一直下去
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

54
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,184
他知道吗?

听好了...
So, listen.

56
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,201
我接下来有个工作...
There is a job coming up.

57
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:52,161
我希望多姆现在就在这里 
I was hoping Dom was going to be here by now

58
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,999
但这一次很容易 没有他也行
but this one is clean enough we can do it without him.

59
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:57,792
赚头不少
It's a good gig. Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

几辆名贵跑车 非常容易得手

但还需要几个帮手

63
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,345
我不知道
I don't know.

64
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:12,056
这里的窃车市场很大
Look, the way the car scene is down here

65
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,101
很快就能脱手 大赚一笔
we can unload them quick and get top dollar.

66
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:17,228
这是快钱 
It's easy money.

67
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,814
在我看来...
And from where I'm sitting,

68
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,901
你们俩都很需要钱
it looks like you both could use the payday.

69
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:04,734

76
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,085
什么?
Huh?

我不是叫你低调一点吗?
I thought I told you to lay low.

88

Yeah, you all right?

142
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:53,608
嗨
Hey.

143
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,240
嗨 是的
Hey, yeah.

144
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,869
不亏是托雷多家族的
Just like a Toretto.

145
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:06,955
文斯呢?
Where's Vince?

146
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:08,832
问得好
That's a good question.

147
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,835
他会来的
He'll be here.

148
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:13,170
兄弟们 我们上新闻了
Guys, we're all over the news.

149
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,507
他们把火车上缉毒特工的死归咎于我们
They're blaming us for the killing of those DEA agents on the train.

150
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,635
这意味关我们又成了头号通缉犯
Which means we just jumped to the top of the wanted list.

151
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,346
他们会派出联邦特工尽一切手段找到我们 
The feds have got to show everyone their agents are off limits

152
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,931
而且一定是最厉害的特工
and they're going to send their best guys. 

153
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:25,182
我们得赶快离开
We got to get out of here.

154
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,519
我们能确定一件事...
One thing we know for sure

155
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,647
他们要这辆跑车
is that they wanted this car.

156
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,483
里面有他们要的东西
Because something is in it.

157
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,403
如果我们能够找到 就知道我们的对手是谁了
If we find out what it is, we'll know what we're up against.

158
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,382
好了,听我说,我们追捕的是职业逃犯
All right, listen up! The men we're after are professional runners.

159
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:01,301
他们喜欢飙车而且无所不用其极 
They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way

160
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:02,719
你们要有所准备
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

161
00:21:02,803 --> 00:21:03,846
把他们找出来...
We find them, 

162
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,764
逮捕他们,再把他们带回来
we take them as a team, and we bring them back.

163
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,266
最重要的是...
And above all else, 

164
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:10,269
绝对,绝对,绝对不能让他们有机会进到车里
we don't ever, ever let them get into cars.

165
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,063
犯罪发生已经过了十个钟头并在继续 兄弟们 快去猎捕他们
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, men. Let's go hunting.

166
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,236
霍布斯探员,我是警察局长 约翰・奥梅达
Agente Hobbs! Chief of Police, Joo Alemeida.

167
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,445
卢克
Luke.

168
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,740
你的手下遇害我很遗憾
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

169
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,909
抓两个人需要这么大阵容吗?
Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

170
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,536
让我告诉你这两个人的情况
Let me tell you something about these two men.

171
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,080
一个是前联邦干员 卧底五年 
One is a former federal officer, been in deep cover for five years.

172
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,040
他熟悉你们抓他的每一个手法
He knows every way you're going to come for him.

173
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,210
另一个是职业罪犯 两次越狱
The other one is a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

174
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:37,796
大半辈子都在躲避你这样的家伙
spent half his life on the run avoiding folks like you.

175
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,757
那么 如果有什么我们能够帮得上国安局...
Well, if there's anything we can do to help the DSS...

176
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,885
两件事,我需要一名翻译
Two things. One, I need a translator.

177
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,428
公关部有很多翻译
We have plenty in the public relations department.

178
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,430
埃琳娜・内维斯
Elena Neves.

179
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,724
一名巡警?
A patrol officer? 

180
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:49,808
你听见了
You heard me.

181
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,269
但是为什么是她?我有经验更丰富的人选
But why? We have many more experienced people.

182
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,313
我喜欢她的笑容
I like her smile.

183
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,440
第二件事呢?
What's the second thing?

184
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,402
离我远点
Stay the fuck out of my way.

185
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:11,830
- 布莱恩 - 嗯?
- Brian. - Hm?

186
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:15,125
我有件事要告诉你
I have something I have to tell you.

187
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,461
可恶
God damn.

188
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,795
我们搞砸了!
What a mess!

189
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,257
你去了哪里 哥们?
Where you been, man?

190
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,803
你说话小心点
You better check that tone.

191
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,722
你最好给我老实回答 
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

192
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,307
够了 你们俩
Stop it! Both of you.

193
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,811
你去了哪里 文斯?
Where were you, Vince?

194
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,982
有伙人在贫民窟到处找你 
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

195
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,652
我很难脱身 怕把他们引向你们...
Couldn't get out of there without leading them straight to you.

196
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:42,986
得等他们离开
Had to wait them out.

197
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,655
在说什么屁话
That is such horseshit.

198
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,823
- 就是你干的 那些家伙都是你的人! - 嘿!
- That was your job, and those were your guys! - Hey!

199
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,492
嘿!行了 奥康纳!
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

200
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,327
如果他说他没干 那他就没干 
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

201
00:22:50,494 --> 00:22:51,620
出去吹会风
Go walk it off.

202
00:23:06,677 --> 00:23:10,305
听着 我想将我的运营扩展到你的国家 
Look, I would love to expand my operations into your countries

203
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:12,599
但是,非常坦率的说...
but, quite frankly, 

204
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,434
你们商业手腕太暴力了
your business methods are too violent.

205
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,729
我给你讲一个真实的故事 
Let me tell you a true story.

206
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,898
五百年前
Five hundred years ago, 

207
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:22,150
葡萄牙人和西班牙人来到这里
the Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

208
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,862
都想从土著人手中抢走这国家
each trying to get the country from their natives.

209
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,950
西班牙人带着枪炮大开杀戒
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing, 

210
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,494
想证明谁才是老大
determined to prove who was boss.

211
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,083
结果土著人杀了所有西班牙人
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

212
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:43,880
个人而言 我更喜欢葡萄牙人的作风 
Personally, I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

213
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,050
他们带着礼物来这里
They came bearing gifts.

214
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:50,262
镜子,剪刀,珠宝...
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

215
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:54,057
土著人自己无法获得的东西
Things that the natives couldn't get on their own,

216
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,184
但是要继续得到这些
but to continue receiving them, 

217
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,394
他们就要替葡萄牙人干活
they had to work for the Portuguese.

218
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,357
这就是为什么巴西人现在说葡萄牙语的原因 
And that's why all Brazilians speak Portuguese today.

219
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,570
现在,如果你用暴力控制人们 
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

220
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:10,907
他们肯定会以暴制暴,因为光脚不怕穿鞋的 
they will eventually fight back because they have nothing to lose.

221
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,535
这才是关键
And that's the key.

222
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:15,662
我去贫民窟
I go into the favelas 

223
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:18,248
带给他们需要的东西 
and give them something to lose.

224
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,375
电力,自来水...
Electricity, running water,

225
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,586
孩子读书的学校
school rooms for their kids.

226
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:26,923
我给他们更好的生活
And for that taste of a better life,

227
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:30,469
他们就属于我
I own them.

228
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,679
先生们
Gentlemen.

229
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,810
抱歉 打扰了
I apologize for the interruption.

230
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:41,813
雷耶斯老大,我能跟你谈谈吗?
Seor Reyes, may I speak with you?

231
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,483
我们找到他们了
We've found them.

232
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,944
失陪了,各位
Pardon me, gentlemen.

233
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,003
我差点就错过了
Almost wish I didn't see that.

234
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,175
差一点
Almost.

235
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,427
等等,多姆 
Wait, Dom.

236
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,348
米娅在火车上,我的妹妹!
Mia was on that train. My sister!

237
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,476
我并不知情,我绝不会伤害她
I didn't know. I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

238
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,020
这一票是你安排的!
You set up the deal!

239
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,773
我以为他们要的是车子
I thought the job was for the cars.

240
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,485
我并不知情 原来他们要的是芯片
I didn't know.All they want is the chip.

241
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,155
可恶!
Damn!

242
00:25:32,823 --> 00:25:34,449
你应该说实话
You should've come clean.

243
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,159
这是怎么回事?
What's going on out here?

244
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,161
没事
Nothing.

245
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:41,832
拜托了 多姆 就让我拿走芯片吧 我带着去见他们
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip. I can take this to them.

246
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,000
他们会交给雷耶斯 然后事情就解决了 
They'll give it to Reyes and set things right.

247
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,128
出去
Get out.

248
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,007
什么?
What?

249
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,175
滚出去!
Get out!

250
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,185
你从来都不听我的
You never listen to me.

251
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:04,688
我告诉你他是个警察你不信
Not when I told you he was a cop, 

252
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,898
现在还是不信
and not now.

253
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,400
你从来都不相信我
You never trust me 

254
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,861
看看我们落到什么下场
and look where it's gotten us.

255
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,196
看看我们一家人
Look at our family now.

256
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,407
我有家不能回!
I can't go home! 

257
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,368
你妹妹流离失所
Your sister is stuck in this life!

258
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,412
莱蒂在哪 多姆?
Where's Letty, Dom?

259
00:26:22,873 --> 00:26:23,874
莱蒂在哪里?
Where's Letty?

260
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:49,774
乙炔切割机
Plasma cutter.

261
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,111
威尔克斯,我要一份50英里之内 
Wilkes, I want a list of every place within 50 miles

262
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,946
贩售压缩气瓶的店家名单
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

263
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,240
把载货清单给我
Pass me that manifest.

264
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:05,916
内维斯警官 我正等着你 
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

265
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,167
你调我来的?
You asked for me? 

266
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,335
没错
I did.

267
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,086
为什么?
May I ask why?

268
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,589
我的笑容没那么好看
My smile is not that great.

269
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,720
你丈夫是警察 在贫民区被枪杀
Your husband was an officer who was gunned down in the favela.

270
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:20,805
半年后你重新振作并加入警局
Six months later, you upped and joined the force.

271
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,098
你是有动机的
You're motivated.

272
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,810
还有 我认为你是里约唯一不会被收买的人 
Plus, I figure you're the only one in Rio who can't be bought.

273
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,437
我说的对吗?
Am I right?

274
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,439
对
Yes. 

275
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,565
我当然是对的
Of course I am.

276
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:31,983
有个好消息和坏消息 
Good news, bad news.

277
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:33,777
你知道我喜欢先吃甜点
You know I like my dessert first.

278
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,779
按照你的吩咐 我查了火车路线
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

279
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:38,114
找到了两处他们卸车的地点
Found a couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

280
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,783
有一辆往西开走
One set of tracks headed west

281
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,452
开到高速公路就不见踪影
until it hit the main highway, then disappeared.

282
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,912
另一辆往东开...
But another set of tracks headed east.

283
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,456
轴距107寸,胎印8寸半
A 1 07-inch wheelbase, eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

284
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,959
正是货运单中不见的GT40跑车 
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

285
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,627
跟了两英哩,全都是泥地
Followed the trail a couple of miles.Pretty easy in this scrub.

286
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,922
很难不留下胎印
Can't move without leaving a sign.

287
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,423
坏消息是什么?
Give me the damn veggies.

288
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,802
后来开上公路 我们也跟丢了
The ground rolls into a hardpack and we lost that track, too.

289
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,638
未必
Not necessarily.

290
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,975
那条路直通山上的贫民窟 
That road heads up through the hills into the favelas.

291
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,477
几年前 被暴风雨冲毁
Couple of years ago, it was washed out by a storm.

292
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,980
离你来的地方一英里全是泥路
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

293
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:13,149
如果他们是向着那个方向 就能找到他们的踪迹 
If they headed that way, we'll pick up their tracks there.

294
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,443
你是有备而来啊 
You come prepared.

295
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,070
我是有动机的
I'm motivated.

296
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:18,822
好吧
All right, then.

297
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,616
咱们去找那辆跑车
Let's find ourselves a car.

298
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,273
你怎么看?
What do you think?

299
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,859
这绝对是特别订做的芯片
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

300
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,362
看这些侧边菜单 是为了输入数据的 
Look at all these side menus here for data entry.

301
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:01,364
来看看这个 
Let's check this one.

302
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,454
你们看
Look at that.

303
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,956
同样的地方,每周同样的订单
Same building, same order every week.

304
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,125
这是交货时间表
It's a delivery schedule.

305
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,064
这是什么?
What's this?

306
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:36,483
毒品?
Drugs?

307
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,402
不,那是装现金的袋子
No. That's a dealer pack.

308
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:41,404
看 黑道老大都习惯秤钞票的重量
See, most major players, they weigh their money

309
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:43,406
这样就不必一直数钞票
so they don't have to constantly count it.

310
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:47,035
看这里 49公斤 49公斤就是1百万张的20元钞票重量
Right there, that's 49 kilos.49 kilos is a million in twenties.

311
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:50,205
所以这里每一批货都是一千万元?
You're saying each one of these shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

312
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,373
对
Yeah.

313
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,106
我认为也是 
I thought so.

314
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,110
那是什么?
So what is that?

315
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,862
一亿多美金在金库里?
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

316
00:30:23,029 --> 00:30:24,948
他们就是这样避开警方追踪的
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

317
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:30,036
我想为了安全起见 雷耶斯一定很想拿回芯片
I think it's safe to say that Reyes is smart to want this back.

318
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,123
这是他的全部网点 就存在一枚芯片里
It's his whole network right there, just laid out on a chip.

319
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,605
威尔克斯,弗斯科,走中路
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.

320
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,399
麦克,乔多,从北边包抄
Mac, Chato, flank north.

321
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,109
我呢?
What about me?

322
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,277
原地待命 
Stay here.

323
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,955
- 去那边! - 墙外再去两个人!
- Go that way! - The other two went over the wall!

324
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,501
快走!快走!
Come on, go! Go!

325
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:59,519
警察!趴下!
Get on the ground.

326
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:02,564
我逮到了托雷多 在你以北四个街区...
I got Toretto. Four blocks north of your...

327
00:33:11,369 --> 00:33:13,079
他们已经知道你是什么人了 
They already know who you are.

328
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,460
走吧!
Let's go.

329
00:34:22,433 --> 00:34:23,250
解除警戒!
All clear?

330
00:34:23,533 --> 00:34:24,650
收到!
Clear!

331
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,615
你没事吧?
You okay here?

332
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:43,452
我没事,谢谢你
Yeah. I'm good. Thank you.

333
00:35:18,195 --> 00:35:20,990
他们现在会盯我们三个人
They're going to be looking for the three of us together now.

334
00:35:21,156 --> 00:35:23,701
我们得分开来
We need to split up.

335
00:35:23,867 --> 00:35:26,620
你和米娅向南,我把他们引开 
You and Mia head south, I'll lead them away.

336
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:27,788
不
No.

337
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:30,040
多姆说的对 
Dom is right.

338
00:35:30,207 --> 00:35:31,875
我们刚才算走运,下次就不好说了
Look how lucky we just got. What happens next time?

339
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,127
除了分开别无选择 
We have no choice but to split up.

340
00:35:33,294 --> 00:35:34,461
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

341
00:35:39,258 --> 00:35:40,759
我已经失去过一次家人 
I already lost my family once.

342
00:35:42,845 --> 00:35:44,596
不想再发生第二次
I'm not going through that again.

343
00:35:45,848 --> 00:35:46,807
你在开玩笑吗?
Are you kidding me? 

344
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:47,975
我没有
No.

345
00:35:53,314 --> 00:35:55,941
我哪儿都不会去
I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

346
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:02,448
多姆,答应我 我们要在一起
Dom? Promise me we stick together.

347
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:12,082
我答应你
I promise.

348
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:19,131
我们的家族又壮大了 
Our family just got bigger.

349
00:36:37,232 --> 00:36:38,984
有点儿不对劲 
Something doesn't add up.

350
00:36:39,443 --> 00:36:40,944
托雷多和奥康纳
Toretto and O'Conner.

351
00:36:41,445 --> 00:36:43,781
他们该逃的时候没有逃
They stay when they're supposed to run, 

352
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:46,033
偷了油罐车又送人?
they steal gas then give it away?

353
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,743
现在却忽然杀了联邦探员?
Now they're killing federal agents?

354
00:36:49,078 --> 00:36:50,496
这一点也说不通啊
It doesn't make any sense.

355
00:36:50,662 --> 00:36:52,456
让我告诉你吧
Here's what makes sense.

356
00:36:57,086 --> 00:36:58,587
他们都是通缉犯
All these guys are is names on a list.

357
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,089
他们逃 我们就追 
They come up, we take them down.

358
00:37:00,255 --> 00:37:02,675
不用怀疑 不择手段
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

359
00:37:02,841 --> 00:37:04,551
威尔克斯 找到什么?
Wilkes, we get anything?

360
00:37:04,927 --> 00:37:06,220
常规证据 
Standard forensics.

361
00:37:06,387 --> 00:37:08,097
鞋印 毛发和纤维
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

362
00:37:08,263 --> 00:37:09,306
车上全是指纹
Prints are all over the car.

363
00:37:09,473 --> 00:37:10,474
还有什么?
Anything else?

364
00:37:10,641 --> 00:37:12,851
还有 我们追查到了车主的身份 
Yeah, we tracked the owner off the vehicle ID.

365
00:37:13,018 --> 00:37:14,395
拥有几家皮包公司 
There are a couple of shell companies in between,

366
00:37:14,561 --> 00:37:16,939
但是最后我们追查到一个集团
but we finally traced it back to a corporation

367
00:37:17,106 --> 00:37:19,775
老板是一名叫赫南・雷耶斯的投资家
owned by an investor down here named Hernan Reyes.

368
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:20,943
投资家?
Investor?

369
00:37:22,069 --> 00:37:25,406
如果里约有什么为非作歹 雷耶斯都有份儿
If there's anything illegal happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

370
00:37:25,572 --> 00:37:27,032
好吧,盯紧他
Okay, then so are we.

371
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,243
如果他能让我们更了解这些家伙 就要查清楚他的底细
If he could get us any closer to our guys, I want everything on him.

372
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:30,786
乔托,到屋顶盯梢
Chato, you're on the roof.

373
00:37:30,953 --> 00:37:33,038
也许有人会回来拿东西
I want you on overwatch in case somebody comes back for something.

374
00:37:33,205 --> 00:37:35,582
麦克,查清楚雷耶斯的底细
Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes, full specs.

375
00:37:35,666 --> 00:37:37,793
即使他去厕所 你也要跟着
If he goes to the john, I want to know how many times he shakes it.

376
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:38,961
没问题 老大
You got it, boss. 

377
00:37:39,086 --> 00:37:40,170
威尔克斯,弗斯科!
Wilkes, Fusco!

378
00:37:41,046 --> 00:37:42,923
重新组装这辆跑车
Let's put all this mess back together.

379
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:46,885
那得花一点时间
That's going to take a while.

380
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,303
那你最好马上开始
Then you better get started.

381
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:50,222
他们拆解这辆车一定有原因
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

382
00:37:50,389 --> 00:37:52,182
重新组装就知道有什么不见了
Let's put it back together and find out what's missing.

383
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:23,213
多姆,你还记得你爸爸的事情吗?
Hey, Dom, what do you remember about your father?

384
00:38:25,674 --> 00:38:27,384
我爸...
My father.

385
00:38:31,555 --> 00:38:33,849
他以前...
He used to...

386
00:38:34,516 --> 00:38:38,353
每周日去完教堂都会举行烤肉会
He used to have a barbecue every Sunday after church.

387
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:40,773
让街坊邻居都参加
For anybody in the neighborhood.

388
00:38:41,857 --> 00:38:44,193
你不去教堂就吃不到烤肉
If you didn't go to church, you didn't get any barbecue.

389
00:38:46,028 --> 00:38:49,740
每天白天他都在店里 到了晚上
Every single day he was in the shop, and every single night,

390
00:38:49,907 --> 00:38:52,576
他就陪米娅坐在餐桌旁
he was at the kitchen table with Mia, 

391
00:38:52,701 --> 00:38:54,912
教她做功课
helping her with her homework.

392
00:38:56,371 --> 00:38:58,874
就算她去睡了
Even after she went to sleep,

393
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:02,044
他还是会待上几个小时
he'd stay up for a few more hours

394
00:39:02,211 --> 00:39:06,131
学会下一课,隔天陪她做功课
so he could learn the next chapter and help her the next day.

395
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:09,092
我记得我爸的一切
I remember everything about my father.

396
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,970
一切
Everything.

397
00:39:13,096 --> 00:39:14,431
我正好相反
That's just it.

398
00:39:14,807 --> 00:39:16,308
我一点都不记得我爸
I don't remember shit about my dad.

399
00:39:20,062 --> 00:39:21,396
我不记得他大吼
I don't remember him yelling.

400
00:39:21,563 --> 00:39:23,065
我不记得他大笑
I don't remember him smiling.

401
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:27,444
说真的我连他长什么样都不记得
To be honest with you, I don't even remember what the hell he looked like.

402
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:31,657
我啥都不记得,他......
I don't remember. He just......

403
00:39:33,742 --> 00:39:35,118
他好像从来就不存在
He was just never there.

404
00:39:37,329 --> 00:39:39,456
你不会像他那样的 布莱恩 
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

405
00:39:56,098 --> 00:39:58,267
我们不能一直逃亡 多姆
We can't keep running, Dom.

406
00:39:59,935 --> 00:40:01,436
我们得离开这种状态
We got to get out.

407
00:40:01,603 --> 00:40:03,522
就是趁现在
We got to get out now.

408
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:06,108
你说得对
You're right.

409
00:40:17,661 --> 00:40:19,329
我有一个打算
Here's how we're going to do it.

410
00:40:23,542 --> 00:40:24,793
我们要利用这玩意
We're going to use this.

411
00:40:25,961 --> 00:40:27,796
干下最后的一票
We're going do one last job.

412
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:30,549
拿走雷耶斯所有的钱
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

413
00:40:30,841 --> 00:40:32,467
让他一毛不剩
Every dime of it,

414
00:40:33,343 --> 00:40:35,012
然后销声匿迹 
and disappear.

415
00:40:38,557 --> 00:40:39,641
隐退江湖 
Forever.

416
00:40:41,184 --> 00:40:42,352
全新的护照
New passports.

417
00:40:42,436 --> 00:40:43,395
全新的生活
New lives 

418
00:40:43,478 --> 00:40:44,896
再也不用提心吊胆
with no more looking over our shoulder.

419
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,523
我们要用钱买回自由
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

420
00:40:46,648 --> 00:40:47,733
没错
That's right.

421
00:40:47,816 --> 00:40:49,318
你知道我们要对付...
You realize we're talking about going up against

422
00:40:49,484 --> 00:40:50,819
里约最有权力的黑道老大吧?
the most powerful guy in all of Rio?

423
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:52,571
我知道
Yes, we are.

424
00:40:53,989 --> 00:40:55,907
那我们需要一个团队
Then we're going to need a team.

425
00:41:02,497 --> 00:41:04,833
先从基本的说起,需要谁?
Let's run through the bases real quick. Who do we got?

426
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,335
我们需要一个变色龙
First we're going to need a chameleon.

427
00:41:07,836 --> 00:41:11,715
随时可以融入周围环境
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

428
00:41:12,716 --> 00:41:13,759
还有呢?
What else?

429
00:41:13,842 --> 00:41:14,885
一个吹牛大王
A fast talker.

430
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:18,347
可以把死的说成活的,黑的说成白的
Someone who can bullshit their way out of anything.

431
00:41:18,764 --> 00:41:19,765
我有人选
I got that.

432
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,935
雷耶斯一定有很多监视设备
This guy is going to have a lot of surveillance.

433
00:41:23,101 --> 00:41:24,978
我们需要一个电子高手
We're going to need someone who's good with circuits.

434
00:41:27,147 --> 00:41:29,691
他的电脑系统一定有防火墙
And with those circuits, Reyes is going to have walls.

435
00:41:29,858 --> 00:41:32,152
我们需要一个电脑骇客
We're going to need guys to punch through those walls.

436
00:41:34,029 --> 00:41:35,155
还有呢?
What else?

437
00:41:35,697 --> 00:41:37,449
武器专家
Utilities and weapons.

438
00:41:37,616 --> 00:41:39,701
天不怕地不怕
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

439
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:43,080
随时能支援每个人
Someone to back up every position.

440
00:41:43,246 --> 00:41:44,706
还需要什么人?
Yeah, what else do we need?

441
00:41:44,873 --> 00:41:46,541
最重要的是...
Most importantly,

442
00:41:47,584 --> 00:41:49,836
我们需要两名飚车高手
we're going to need two precision drivers.

443
00:41:50,045 --> 00:41:52,381
泰山崩于前而色不改 
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

444
00:41:52,589 --> 00:41:54,049
从未失手过 
Guys that never lose.

445
00:41:55,342 --> 00:41:56,635
那就非我们莫属了
You know we got that.

446
00:42:24,538 --> 00:42:26,540
哦 天啊 不是吧!
Aw, hell, no!

447
00:42:27,499 --> 00:42:30,127
他们真的是矬子里拔大个儿了,对不?
I see they really scraped the bottom of the barrel, huh?

448
00:42:30,293 --> 00:42:32,587
我觉得也是 一看到你就知道了
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

449
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:37,300
快把那辆老爷车还给马丁・路德・金吧
When are you going to give Martin Luther King his car back?

450
00:42:34,339 --> 00:42:37,300
{\an8}(马丁・路德・金 - 美国黑人运动领袖)

451
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:40,220
等你把里克・詹姆斯的夹克送回去再说吧
As soon as you give Rick James his jacket back.

452
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:40,220
{\an8}(里克・詹姆斯 - 70年代著名放克音乐人)

453
00:42:43,473 --> 00:42:44,516
最近怎么样 哥们?
What's up, man? 

454
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:45,600
你呢?
What's up?

455
00:42:56,861 --> 00:42:57,861
嗯
Hmm.

456
00:42:58,613 --> 00:43:00,699
好性感的双腿,小妞
Sexy legs, baby girl.

457
00:43:00,866 --> 00:43:02,075
啥时我们出去兜风?
What time do they open?

458
00:43:02,951 --> 00:43:06,747
出去之日就是你命丧之时 
They open the same time as I pull this trigger.

459
00:43:07,289 --> 00:43:08,749
您说还开吗?
Want me to open them?

460
00:43:12,419 --> 00:43:15,255
我告诉过你 瘦鸡才下蛋嘛
I told you the skinny chick had balls.

461
00:43:15,422 --> 00:43:17,924
看来 她没等我们就先开派对
Looks like she started the party without us.

462
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,802
嘿 哥们 用西班牙语骂娘有多了不起啊 
Hey, anybody can talk shit in Spanish, homie.

463
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,056
这家伙在说什么?
What's this guy saying?

464
00:43:24,765 --> 00:43:26,683
不管说什么话 丑男还是丑男
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish or in English.

465
00:43:29,644 --> 00:43:30,645
这两个小丑是谁?
Who are these clowns, man?

466
00:43:30,729 --> 00:43:31,813
马戏团的
Circus clowns.

467
00:43:33,899 --> 00:43:36,818
我以为斗鸡在巴西是非法的
I thought cockfights were illegal in Brazil.

468
00:43:36,985 --> 00:43:39,070
看来你们都认识了
I see you all have met.

469
00:43:40,781 --> 00:43:42,783
你把我们叫来里约
You know when you called me to come to Rio

470
00:43:42,949 --> 00:43:45,744
我想应该有更刺激的事要做吧
I assumed it would be for something more exciting than this.

471
00:43:45,827 --> 00:43:46,870
嘿 哥们 
Look at this guy.

472
00:43:46,953 --> 00:43:47,954
好久不见
Long time. 

473
00:43:48,038 --> 00:43:49,081
挺想你的 哥们
I missed you, man.

474
00:43:49,164 --> 00:43:50,165
见到你真好
Good to see you.

475
00:43:50,290 --> 00:43:51,249
好兄弟
Brother. 

476
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,417
最近怎么样
What's up?

477
00:43:52,501 --> 00:43:54,419
嘿 过来认识一下 这是泰吉
Yo, check this out. This is Tej.

478
00:43:54,503 --> 00:43:56,338
东海岸最好的电子专家
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

479
00:43:56,505 --> 00:43:58,006
这是我的死党 罗曼・皮尔斯
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

480
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,509
我们是老相识了 在管教所就认识了
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

481
00:44:00,675 --> 00:44:02,219
迈阿密那一票就是跟他干的
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

482
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:03,804
对你早有耳闻 
I've heard about you.

483
00:44:04,971 --> 00:44:06,389
这里挺高档的嘛
Nice digs.

484
00:44:06,556 --> 00:44:08,350
啊 瑞兹酒店满了
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

485
00:44:08,892 --> 00:44:10,560
这是怎么回事 多姆?
So what's this all about, Dom?

486
00:44:10,727 --> 00:44:13,480
是啊 翻山越岭跑这么远来干啥?
Yeah, man, why did you drag us halfmay around the world?

487
00:44:14,147 --> 00:44:16,775
因为我们要干一票
Because we got a job.

488
00:44:16,942 --> 00:44:19,486
听好了 我们的目标是赫南・雷耶斯
All right, so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

489
00:44:19,653 --> 00:44:21,279
他是这里的大毒枭
And he runs the drug scene down here.

490
00:44:21,446 --> 00:44:23,907
他从来没栽过 因为他从未开过户
He's never been busted because he doesn't leave a paper trail.

491
00:44:24,074 --> 00:44:26,034
没有户头就意味着没有存银行 
No paper trail means no banks.

492
00:44:26,201 --> 00:44:28,203
没有存银行就意味着有金库
And no banks means cash houses.

493
00:44:28,370 --> 00:44:30,705
没错 确切的说 总共十个据点
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

494
00:44:30,872 --> 00:44:32,958
散布于整个城市
Spread throughout the city.

495
00:44:33,124 --> 00:44:35,043
我们要把他们都端了
And we're going to hit them all.

496
00:44:36,378 --> 00:44:37,379
全部?
All of them?

497
00:44:37,838 --> 00:44:38,839
全部!
All of them.

498
00:44:39,005 --> 00:44:40,841
听起来太疯狂了
That sounds crazy.

499
00:44:41,007 --> 00:44:42,884
你把我们大老远找来
You bring us to a whole other country

500
00:44:43,051 --> 00:44:45,095
就为了抢这里的黑道老大?
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

501
00:44:46,221 --> 00:44:47,848
我本以为是笔大买卖
I thought this was business.

502
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:49,432
但听起来更像私人恩怨
Sounds personal to me.

503
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:51,977
是不是这样?
Is that what this is?

504
00:44:52,143 --> 00:44:53,603
我爱你们所有人
I got love for y'all, 

505
00:44:53,687 --> 00:44:55,897
但私人恩怨不是什么好买卖
but personal ain't good business.

506
00:44:57,482 --> 00:44:59,734
我想我干不了 哥们 
I can't do this, homie.

507
00:45:00,986 --> 00:45:05,073
这一票有一亿美金
So what we're talking about is $100 million.

508
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,158
你说啥?
You say what?

509
00:45:07,325 --> 00:45:08,660
一亿?
Hundred... 

510
00:45:08,743 --> 00:45:10,871
你瞧 我这人有时是有点儿多虑 哥们 
See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

511
00:45:11,037 --> 00:45:13,999
我知道我们才刚认识 但是你刚刚 貌似 说...
and I know we just met, but you just, kind of, got to...

512
00:45:14,165 --> 00:45:17,836
没错,一亿美金
That's right, $100 million, 

513
00:45:18,003 --> 00:45:19,337
抢来的一切 都会平分
and everything we take, we split even.

514
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:21,298
人均超过1100万美元
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

515
00:45:22,257 --> 00:45:23,675
我干了
I am down.

516
00:45:24,134 --> 00:45:25,260
我也干
I'm in.

517
00:45:26,761 --> 00:45:28,221
1100万...
Eleven million.

518
00:45:28,597 --> 00:45:31,349
听上去 像是无数的女人向我涌来
Sounds like a whole lot of vaginal activity to me.

519
00:45:31,766 --> 00:45:34,019
同样的目标不可能抢十次
You can't pull off 10 heists on the same mark.

520
00:45:34,185 --> 00:45:35,186
你不可能成功十次
You just can't.

521
00:45:35,353 --> 00:45:36,813
一旦抢了第一个...
As soon as we hit the first one,

522
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,733
他们就会全力保护其他的据点
they're going to do everything they can to protect the rest.

523
00:45:40,734 --> 00:45:42,444
一点也没错
Exactly.

524
00:46:20,982 --> 00:46:22,692
不准动!
Nobody move!

525
00:46:37,332 --> 00:46:38,500
全都在这里
That's all of it.

526
00:46:38,667 --> 00:46:39,751
你死定了!
You a dead man.

527
00:46:39,918 --> 00:46:41,002
你们全都死定了!
You're all dead men!

528
00:46:41,878 --> 00:46:43,338
你们无处可藏了
You don't have a place to hide.

529
00:46:46,341 --> 00:46:47,425
谁说要藏了?
Who's hiding?

530
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:48,677
你疯啦?
Are you crazy?

531
00:46:48,843 --> 00:46:49,928
你疯了吗?
Are you crazy?

532
00:46:50,095 --> 00:46:51,388
你知不道这是谁的地盘?
Do you know whose house this is? 

533
00:46:51,554 --> 00:46:53,014
你们偷的是谁的钱?
Whose money are you stealing?

534
00:47:03,441 --> 00:47:04,859
我们并不偷
We ain't stealing it.

535
00:47:13,785 --> 00:47:16,955
告诉你老板到底是谁干的
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

536
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:20,041
告诉他这事没完,我们还会来的
Tell him there's more coming.

537
00:47:25,797 --> 00:47:26,923
看看吧
Voila

538
00:47:27,632 --> 00:47:28,633
发动引擎
Turn it over.

539
00:47:34,806 --> 00:47:38,059
八个汽缸运转正常 都没问题
She's running on all eight. Checks out fine.

540
00:47:40,603 --> 00:47:42,480
继续找
Keep looking.

541
00:47:44,566 --> 00:47:48,111
老大 如果少了什么 我们一定知道
Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.

542
00:48:13,678 --> 00:48:17,348
改装这款经典跑车真是浪费
It's a goddamn shame putting bullshit like that on a classic.

543
00:48:17,766 --> 00:48:19,768
干脆加装霓虹灯算了
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

544
00:48:31,029 --> 00:48:32,947
他们拿走了芯片
They took the chip.

545
00:48:33,114 --> 00:48:34,699
我们拦截到警方无线电
We got a hit on the police scanner. 

546
00:48:34,866 --> 00:48:36,785
黎伯龙一所房屋发生持械抢劫
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

547
00:48:36,951 --> 00:48:40,161
案发地点的业主是赫南・雷耶斯
Address cross-checks against property owned by one of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

548
00:48:40,163 --> 00:48:41,289
好 如果是我们要找的人 
All right, if that's our guys

549
00:48:41,456 --> 00:48:43,958
那就是芯片里的资料让他们找到那里
then whatever was on that chip led them directly to that house.

550
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,293
是他们 没错
It's them, for sure.

551
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:46,669
你怎么知道?
How do you know that?

552
00:48:46,836 --> 00:48:51,174
在里约没有人会笨到抢雷耶斯的钱
Because no one else in Rio is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

553
00:49:04,562 --> 00:49:05,730
说清楚些
Explain.

554
00:49:06,314 --> 00:49:07,982
他们突袭黎伯龙区的据点
They invaded the Leblon house.

555
00:49:08,358 --> 00:49:09,567
对方是谁?
Who invaded?

556
00:49:09,734 --> 00:49:12,153
抢火车的那一票人
The men from the train.

557
00:49:20,495 --> 00:49:22,705
他们抢走多少钱?
How much did they take?

558
00:49:22,872 --> 00:49:24,666
他们没有抢钱
They didn't take anything.

559
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:28,378
他们把钱烧掉了!
They burned it!

560
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:30,171
他们烧掉我的钱?
They burned my money?

561
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:33,424
对,他们还说不会罢手
Yes. And said there's more coming.

562
00:49:41,516 --> 00:49:42,642
好吧
Okay...

563
00:49:51,192 --> 00:49:53,194
这样的话...
Then this...

564
00:49:55,071 --> 00:49:56,531
我们就这样做
...is what we're going to do.

565
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:04,706
把钱都移走
Clean the houses.

566
00:50:04,956 --> 00:50:09,210
我要你把钱都集中封锁起来...
I want that money under lock and key...

567
00:50:10,628 --> 00:50:11,629
在一个小时以内
...within an hour.

568
00:50:11,796 --> 00:50:14,048
明白吗?
Understand?

569
00:50:16,259 --> 00:50:17,886
知道了
Understood.

570
00:50:36,571 --> 00:50:39,073
一号车开走了
Number One is on the move, man.

571
00:50:53,338 --> 00:50:54,923
二号车开走了
Two is on the move.

572
00:51:19,614 --> 00:51:20,615
我这辆也开走了
I got mine.

573
00:51:41,678 --> 00:51:43,680
我正在看五号车
I got eyes on Five.

574
00:52:10,331 --> 00:52:13,668
他们真的把钱集中在同一个地方
I know y'all said they were consolidating the money somewhere, 

575
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:17,005
但你们不会相信藏在哪里
but, y'all ain't going to believe this.

576
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,014
"警察总部"

577
00:52:26,598 --> 00:52:29,058
这一票愈来愈困难了
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

578
00:52:29,726 --> 00:52:31,686
他能把钱移进警署
If he's moving it into a police station

579
00:52:31,853 --> 00:52:34,355
这家伙还真有关系 
he's got some serious brass in his pocket.

580
00:52:34,605 --> 00:52:36,815
看来这次旅途比我想的要短很多
Looks like this is going to be a shorter trip than I thought...

581
00:52:36,815 --> 00:52:38,026
真该死 我们做不来的
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

582
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:41,696
做不来?你是说不应该吧?
"Can't"? You mean, "shouldn't."

583
00:52:42,614 --> 00:52:44,782
我想都是一个意思
I think this doesn't change a thing.

584
00:52:47,785 --> 00:52:50,038
我说要按照原计划进行
I say we stick to the plan.

585
00:52:50,204 --> 00:52:51,873
你说啥?
You say what?

586
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,708
现在的任务由:无法完成...
This just went from Mission: Impossible

587
00:52:53,875 --> 00:52:55,710
变成了:脑残送死
to Mission: In-freaking-sanity.

588
00:52:57,795 --> 00:52:59,047
随你怎么说 哥们 
Whatever, man.

589
00:52:59,213 --> 00:53:00,548
我不是害怕
I ain't scared, 

590
00:53:00,715 --> 00:53:02,425
我只是想让你们知道 疯子才会抢警局
I'm just letting you all know, going in that building is crazy.

591
00:53:02,592 --> 00:53:03,801
我会搞定的
I got this.

592
00:53:07,638 --> 00:53:08,890
抢劫案什么时候发生的?
What time was the robbery?

593
00:53:09,057 --> 00:53:10,892
11点左右
Around 11 :00.

594
00:53:12,435 --> 00:53:13,645
找到了
Here we go.

595
00:53:15,813 --> 00:53:17,315

596
00:53:19,442 --> 00:53:20,777
他们都戴了面罩
Their faces are covered.

597
00:53:20,943 --> 00:53:22,153
通过联邦储备系统查查看

598
00:53:28,159 --> 00:53:29,786
呵呵 你好啊 原来是你这兔崽子
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

除了宇宙飞船以外 飞机 火车 轮船都给我查
Check planes, trains, boats, everything short of the goddamn space shuttle.

602
00:53:48,096 --> 00:53:51,265
他们可以改名换姓 但却不能换脸面
They can change their names but they can't change their faces.

603
00:53:51,432 --> 00:53:53,267
他们要干一票大的
Something big is going down.

604
00:53:54,936 --> 00:53:56,270
那是70年的道奇跑车
That's a 1970 Charger.

605
00:53:56,437 --> 00:53:58,523
弗斯科!把这些上载到资料库

Have the computer cross-check it with overhead satellites every 15 minutes,

607

后面的货车也要监控
the van behind it, too.

608
00:54:03,111 --> 00:54:05,822
如果这些车出现在里约的街道上,立即通知我 
If these vehicles move in the streets of Rio, I want to know about it.

609
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,040

Everything okay?

610
00:54:16,124 --> 00:54:17,125
一切顺利
Everything is okay.

611
00:54:17,208 --> 00:54:19,877
霍布斯是谁?这位联邦探员瞎眼了?
Who is this Hobbs? This Federal Agent running around town?

612
00:54:20,128 --> 00:54:21,212
几个美国牛仔

613

他在掌控之中

他已经杀死我16个手下

615

把他看好一点

00:54:26,676 --> 00:54:27,718
你瞧...
Look...

00:54:27,802 --> 00:54:31,973
他要了一名新任巡警当他的助手 
He requested a rookie patrol officer as his assistant.

618
00:54:34,726 --> 00:54:35,810
他们不是问题

619
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:05,757
全都在这里?
It's all here?

还没有
Nothing yet.

623
00:55:12,388 --> 00:55:14,223
我已派出所有警力搜捕他们
But I have all our officers searching.

624
00:55:15,057 --> 00:55:16,184
这还不够好
Not good enough.

625
00:55:17,059 --> 00:55:18,519
提供悬赏金...
Put a price on their heads.

626
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:20,062
悬赏金要足够高...
High enough...

627
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:22,774
让城里的每双眼睛都想找到他们
...to get every pair of eyes in the city searching for them.

628
00:55:30,281 --> 00:55:32,450
政府大楼的妙处
The beauty of public offices

629
00:55:35,411 --> 00:55:36,454
就是有公共档案 
Public records.

630
00:55:36,787 --> 00:55:37,997
他就把钱放在这里
This is where he's keeping the money. 

631
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:39,207
物证室的金库
The vault in the evidence room.

632
00:55:40,332 --> 00:55:44,669
嘿 请大家听我说一句话
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's attention, right here, for a second?

633
00:55:44,712 --> 00:55:48,299
我们是要闯进警察局
We're talking about breaking into a police station.

634
00:55:48,466 --> 00:55:51,843
有人在听我说吗?在听吗?警察局...
Is anyone listening to those words? Anybody? Popo...

635
00:55:51,886 --> 00:55:54,472
条子 一根筋 蠢猪...

636
00:55:54,639 --> 00:55:55,765
都是我们不喜欢的人
People we don't like.

637
00:55:55,932 --> 00:55:58,768
你知道吗 警察局是设计用来关人 不是放人的
You know, police stations are designed to keep people in, not out.

638
00:55:58,935 --> 00:56:00,394
所以这是个秘密行动
That's why it's a stealth mission.

639
00:56:00,645 --> 00:56:03,272
我们进去出来要做到神不知鬼不觉
We'll be in and out before they even know we were there.

640
00:56:03,439 --> 00:56:04,941
我们需要有人进去勘察
Well, we'll need to get eyes in there.

641
00:56:05,107 --> 00:56:07,610
至少要查出金库的型号
At least to find out the make and model of that vault.

642
00:56:07,777 --> 00:56:11,072
先是金库 还有...
So the vault and then, so...

643
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:12,615
太疯狂了
It's crazy.

644
00:56:12,782 --> 00:56:15,618
谁做这个更适合呢?
Who's supposed to do all this?

645
00:56:24,001 --> 00:56:25,920
你们这是什么意思?
What do you mean?

646
00:56:27,129 --> 00:56:28,172
为什么是我?
Why me?

647
00:56:28,339 --> 00:56:30,132
因为你是吹牛大王
Because you got the biggest mouth.

648
00:56:30,299 --> 00:56:32,301
那倒是真的
That's for damn sure.

649

我喜欢这副眼镜 在哪儿搞到的?
Love those glasses. Where did you get them from?

654
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:50,653
是不是古驰牌的?
Are those like Gucci frames or something?

655
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,946
不会英文?
No English?

656
00:56:52,113 --> 00:56:54,949
不...不...该死
No, no, no. Damn.

657
00:56:55,366 --> 00:56:56,450

Look, I'm working this case and I got some evidence here to be held.

00:57:12,049 --> 00:57:14,468
但我得先进去检查一下你们的贮藏设施
But I need to get in and check your storage facility first.

663

你好像也在健身吧
You know, it looks like you work out a little bit, too.

666
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:23,811
你卧推多少?350磅?
What do you bench, about 350?

667
00:57:24,145 --> 00:57:25,313

Look, I'm just trying to do my job, man.

My boss sent me here to just make sure that everything was safe.

670

It will be safe.

671
00:57:31,986 --> 00:57:33,654
那就让我进去看一眼就行
Let me just come in and take a quick peek.

It's done. See, I think I make a better special agent than you ever did.

686
00:58:24,038 --> 00:58:26,374
是吗 这要看你如何定义"特别"了
Well, that depends on how you define "special."

687
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:30,753
好吧 咱们看看有什么
Come on, now. Let's see what we got.

688
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,380

你连遥控车都不会开
You can't even drive a damn remote control car.

693

I'm going to need you to shut up right now.

694
00:58:56,821 --> 00:58:57,822
我才不会闭嘴...
I'm not going to shut up. 

695
00:58:57,905 --> 00:58:58,948
闭嘴
Shut up.

696
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:00,574
用安全带把他的嘴套上,伙计
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

697
00:59:03,661 --> 00:59:05,121
把遥控器给我 伙计 往左
Give me the remote, dawg. Go left.

698
00:59:05,287 --> 00:59:07,331
好像左边那里有什么东西 那是什么?
It looks like something right over there to the left. What is that?

699
00:59:07,498 --> 00:59:08,582
那是什么?
What is that?

700
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:10,918
找到了
Bingo.

701
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:14,088
怎么样 6x6的?
What is that, six-by-six?

702
00:59:14,255 --> 00:59:15,256
8x12的?
Eight-by-twelve?

703
00:59:15,423 --> 00:59:16,799
是7x12的
Seven-by-twelve.

704
00:59:16,966 --> 00:59:20,010
配备了18英寸厚的强化钢壁
Fitted with 18-inch-thick steel reinforced walls

705
00:59:20,177 --> 00:59:23,639
里面包着隔热铜芯 防止电焊切割
with a insulated copper core to protect against thermal lance.

706
00:59:23,806 --> 00:59:27,184
3级电子锁 配有绝对安全的格里芬锁芯
A Class-3 electronic lock with a surefire Griffin retumbler

707
00:59:27,351 --> 00:59:31,646
还有掌纹扫瞄仪 这是个10吨重的顶级保险柜
and a biometric palm scanner. Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

708
00:59:31,772 --> 00:59:33,441
我想知道 你是怎么知道这些的?
Do I want to know how you know all that?

709
00:59:33,607 --> 00:59:35,443
认识你之前我也有自己的生活 奥康纳 
I had a life before you knew me, O'Conner.

710
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:37,319
还是就此打住吧 行吗?
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

711
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:39,113
虽然她是个美人 老兄
She is a beauty, though, man.

712
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,323
"美人"就是说"很好"吗?
A "beauty" as in "good"?

713
00:59:41,490 --> 00:59:44,326
"美人"就是说 她将很难搞到手
"Beauty" as in, she's going to start off playing hard to get.

714
00:59:44,618 --> 00:59:46,704
不管我如何爱抚她...
Then, no matter how much I caress her, 

715
00:59:46,787 --> 00:59:48,539
不管我有多爱她...
no matter how much I love her,

716
00:59:48,706 --> 00:59:51,959
最后 她还是不愿缴械投降
in the end, she still ain't going to give up that ass.

717
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,428
这是计划中最难的一步
It's one of the toughest vaults to crack in the business.

718
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:58,500
除非我们事先排演
And we ain't gonna go get anywhere with it

719
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:00,000
否则不会成功
unless we got a duplicate to practice with

720
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:02,000
我敢说绝对的
Bet that.

721
01:00:05,742 --> 01:00:07,400
假设你们能突破安全线
So assuming you'll breach the safe.

722
01:00:07,742 --> 01:00:09,000
可是我们怎么进去呢?
How do we get in?

723
01:00:09,300 --> 01:00:11,000
是的,我一直在想怎么进去
Yeah, I've been thinking about the way in

724
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,400
往保安室的墙上
The wall to the evidence room.

725
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:13,600
有警报器
That's alarmed.

726
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,000
所以这条路行不通
So, that's not happening.

727
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:16,500
这边还有一个目标
Then we got this one here.

728
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,200
可是外面是护卫
But there's a guard shack outside.

729
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,200
所以也不行
So that's no good.

730
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,200
但是这边
But this one.

731
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,400
和洗手间只隔了一堵墙
This one shares a wall with the basement bathroom.

732
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,000
那些钱怎么办?
So, what about the money?

733
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:28,000
到时候肯定很难搬
That's gonna be some heavy shit to move.

734
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,200
而且是整整五吨重的现金
And you're talking about five ton cash weight.

735
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,140
没错,这时候洗手间就能派上用场了
Yeah, but that's the thing about the bathroom.

736
01:00:32,300 --> 01:00:34,700
洗手间里有一通往车库的送风口
It's got a vent that leads to the parking garage.

737
01:00:35,000 --> 01:00:37,000
我们就通过那道送风通道
All we gotta do is pop that

738
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:40,000
把钱直接转移到外面等着的车里
vent and then pass the money through to some waiting cars.

739
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,500
里奥,桑托
Leo, Santos.

740
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,000
该你们了!
You're up!

741
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,144
我打赌你会炸错管线
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

742
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:50,397
你干嘛每次都往坏处想?
Yo, why you got to be so negative all the time, man?

743
01:00:50,563 --> 01:00:53,064
我并没有
I ain't negative.

744
01:00:53,274 --> 01:00:55,985
我只是很确定你会搞砸
I'm just positive you're going to mess it up.

745
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:59,155
我告诉你,你有毛病
I'm telling you, man, you got issues.

746
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:07,914
要是下次没有电梯 打死也不来了
Next time if there's no elevator, I'm not coming.

747
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,459
你得学会放轻松 兄弟
You need to learn to relax, loco.

748
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:35,108
你最好快点 我们只剩不到一分钟了 
You better hurry up, we got less than a minute.

749
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:41,281
为什么你每次都把时间设得这么紧?
Why do you always set the timer so short?

750
01:02:04,012 --> 01:02:05,472
希望你知道我们在往哪走 
I hope you know where you're going.

751
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,475
我知道,放松点 老兄 
I got this. Relax, man.

752
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:10,477
放松 
Relax.

753
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:24,574
这就是警察局了 
...a police station.

754
01:02:24,741 --> 01:02:26,201
放松 
Relax.

755
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:40,090
你又用了太多炸药了
You used too much explosive! Again.

756
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:42,842
多点少点差不多...
Too much, too little...

757
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:44,469
还不都是一样
It's all the same.

758
01:02:45,095 --> 01:02:49,933
你是不是在牢里读过什么狗屁佛经?
That's some Buddha shit you learned from a book in the prison library, isn't it?

759
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,560
还有你对着墙做的这些...
And what you're doing there on the wall...

760
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,480
也是从那本书里学的?
You got that from the same book, huh?

761
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:56,648
我看你是想多了 兄弟
You're so negative, bro.

762
01:03:23,550 --> 01:03:25,927
过来照个亮
Can I have some light?

763
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,558
收到了 收到讯号了!
Got it. We got it!

764
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,518
我们看到了四个监视器 
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

765
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,895
哟 那都是些高档货
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too.

766
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,230
光学成像系统
Marker optics.

767
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,566
一百度的视角
Hundred-degree field-of-view.

768
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,359
十秒扫瞄速度
Ten seconds oscillation.

769
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:43,027
是啊 时间太短了 伙计
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

770
01:03:43,278 --> 01:03:45,071
能不能切进系统用图像替换?
Can't we just tap in and replace the image?

771
01:03:45,238 --> 01:03:47,282
不行 它驳接了数字同步系统
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

772
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,242
一侵入就会被察觉
They would know we were in the system.

773
01:03:49,409 --> 01:03:51,411
我们顶多就能偷看一眼
The best we can do is peek.

774
01:03:51,578 --> 01:03:54,080
车速要够快才能躲过这东西
We're going to need some real fast cars to get through this.

775
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,582
不只是要够快
Not just fast.

776
01:03:55,748 --> 01:03:57,876
右侧有个急转弯
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

777
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,878
还要足够灵活才行
We're going to need something agile.

778
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,671
你们做出模拟车道
You guys mock up a track.

779
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:02,839
奥康纳
O'Conner.

780
01:04:04,132 --> 01:04:05,633
我们去弄些车子来
Let's go get some cars.

781
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,468
没问题
Nice.

782
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:48,635
回家的感觉真好
Home sweet home.

783
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:07,820
或许那一辆...
Or that.

784
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,572
那一辆如何?
How about that? 

785
01:05:09,656 --> 01:05:11,032
都装好了 不必调整
All motor, no tuning issues.

786
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:13,493
我一直想要一辆
I always wanted one of those.

787
01:05:13,660 --> 01:05:17,288
我在这条街保持了三年的飚车记录
Held the record on the Avenida three years running.

788
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,872
我干 老兄
Damn, bro...

789
01:05:19,872 --> 01:05:22,502
你真有胆量把麻烦带到这里来 托雷多
You got a lot of balls to bring your problems here, Toretto.

790
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:25,672
还带了一个条子
Not to mention a cop.

791
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,966
是的 我们最好保持低调一点
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

792
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:31,052
所有人都在找你们俩
Word on the street is a lot of people are looking for you two.

793
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,012
怎么?
What?

794
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:35,056
难道以为我们认不出你们?
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

795
01:05:36,474 --> 01:05:38,476
没关系 我们就指望它了
No, we're kind of counting on it.

796
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:41,187
你那台小车也许在这儿很威风
That little coupe may run the streets around here,

797
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:44,607
但是我那台怪物...
but that monster 

798
01:05:44,691 --> 01:05:46,693
...还没看过别人的尾灯呢
has never seen a set of tail lights.

799
01:05:46,985 --> 01:05:48,027
从来没有...
Ever.

800
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:49,195
是吗 她今天就会了
Well, she's about to.

801
01:05:50,029 --> 01:05:52,112
多米尼克・托雷多的车收藏入我的车库
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

802
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:57,537
那...才会是最诺慕北
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

803
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:01,582
来吧,传奇车手
Let's go, legend.

804
01:06:02,542 --> 01:06:05,044
用车赌车
Car for car.

805
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:06,879
用车赌车?
Car for car?

806
01:06:07,046 --> 01:06:08,923
你想要 那就来拿吧
You want it, come and get it.

807
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:15,388
看看他们弄到什么车
Let's see what they got.

808
01:06:21,853 --> 01:06:23,062
不会吧?
Really?

809
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:27,859
你们从哪儿搞到的?蓝精灵爸爸送的?
Where did you get that from? Papa Smurf?

810
01:06:28,026 --> 01:06:30,903
好了,奥康纳,拿出你的看家本事来吧 
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.

811
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:54,927
怎么样?
How was that one?

812
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,054
摄像头拍到你了 
Camera caught you.

813
01:06:56,429 --> 01:06:57,472
什么?
What? 

814
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:58,598
没错 的确拍到你了
Yeah, it still caught you.

815
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:00,641
老兄 我连吃奶的劲都用上了
Man, I was milking the hell out of that thing, too.

816
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:03,227
我们需要一辆更快的车
We're going to need a faster car.

817
01:07:07,565 --> 01:07:09,484
我想要那笔钱啊 冲啊 伙计
I want my money. Come on, man.

818
01:07:13,319 --> 01:07:14,319
耶!
Yeah!

819
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,743
一定行!瞧这个!
Let's get it! Watch this.

820
01:07:25,416 --> 01:07:28,961
这就验证了你真的不会开车
That's exactly why your ass ain't been driving.

821
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:42,141
我想我爱上她了
I think I'm in love.

822
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:47,480
你还真有两下子...
That was real solid work.

823
01:07:47,647 --> 01:07:50,942
但是 三号摄像头还是拍到你
I think Camera 3 still caught you, though.

824
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:52,318
再试一次
Let's do it again.

825
01:07:59,826 --> 01:08:01,577
这是你订的存钱罐
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

826
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:02,703
别开玩笑了
You're kidding me. 

827
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:03,871
没有
Yep.

828
01:08:05,665 --> 01:08:08,501
你们是从哪儿弄来的这个东西?
Where in the hell did y'all get one of these?

829
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,962
在认识你之前 我们也有自己的生活 
Well, we had a life before you met us.

830
01:08:12,296 --> 01:08:15,508
好了 我会研究这个电子锁的
All right, I'll get to work on the electronic tumbler

831
01:08:15,675 --> 01:08:17,844
但还是有一个问题
but there's still another problem.

832
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:19,804
掌纹扫瞄仪
Palm scanner.

833
01:08:19,971 --> 01:08:21,722
没有雷耶斯的掌纹...
And without Reyes' handprint,

834
01:08:22,056 --> 01:08:24,183
就连魔术大师胡迪尼也打不开这玩意儿
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

835
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,185
你怎么知道是雷耶斯的掌纹?
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

836
01:08:26,352 --> 01:08:28,020
你把一亿美元放入金库...
You got $100 million in a safe.

837
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,897
你会用别人的掌纹吗?
You going to put somebody else's handprint on it?

838
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:33,060
你又开始乱想了
Now there you go with that negativity, man.

839
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:34,360
这样下去会要了你的命的
That shit is eating you alive.

840
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,986
- 你最好给我记住 - 你才给我记住呢 闭嘴!
- You check that. - Yo, check that. Shut up!

841
01:08:37,989 --> 01:08:40,032
该怎么弄到雷耶斯的掌纹?
How are we supposed to get Reyes' handprint?

842
01:08:41,367 --> 01:08:44,076
韩 该你上场了
Han. You're up.

843
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:49,500
当然 小事一桩
Sure. Nothing like the easy stuff.

844
01:08:49,667 --> 01:08:51,377
走吧 我开车
Let's go. I'll drive.

845
01:09:09,687 --> 01:09:10,688
我看到六个保镖
I make six bodyguards. 

846
01:09:10,771 --> 01:09:11,772
七个
Seven.

847
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,860
你以为戴腰包的家伙是游客?
You think that guy with a fanny pack is a tourist?

848
01:09:20,698 --> 01:09:23,242
你当了几年的兵?
So, how long were you in the army?

849
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:26,204
那天你掏的枪是杰里科941
That gun you pulled the other day was a Jericho 941.

850
01:09:27,371 --> 01:09:29,207
而且你用拇指拨开枪栓
Thumb-racking the slide?

851
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:31,918
那是摩萨德的路子
That was straight-up MOSSAD.

852
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:31,918
{\an8}(MOSSAD摩萨德:以色列情报局)

853
01:09:32,084 --> 01:09:34,295
我离开军队的时候...
I got out of the military

854
01:09:35,379 --> 01:09:38,424
差不多是你戒烟的时候
probably the same time you quit smoking.

855
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:40,801
你一直在吃薯片...
The amount of chips you eat,

856
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,971
这样你就可以让手和嘴巴不闲着
the way you always have to keep your hands and mouth busy,

857
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:46,766
你以前肯定是个每天两包的烟鬼 
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

858
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,436
还是不带过滤嘴滴
Unfiltered.

859
01:09:54,106 --> 01:09:55,566
这下没搞头了
Well, this is a bust.

860
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:59,779
我们在这里弄不到他的掌纹
We're not going to be able to get his fingerprints out here.

861
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:03,115
我们得多做点侦查工作 再多叫上几个人 
We need to do some more recon, call in a couple of extra guys.

862
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,575
其实...
Or

863
01:10:04,951 --> 01:10:07,161
女人的活用不着男人插手
you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

864
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:08,303
我们马上就会搞定 我保证
We're going to figure this out, I promise you.

865
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:12,810
怎么样了?
What's up?

866
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,855
我以为你很放得开呢
I thought you were more of a thong man.

867
01:11:16,022 --> 01:11:17,356
我们拿到掌纹了 
We got the print.

868
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:19,859
在哪?
Where?

869
01:11:22,028 --> 01:11:24,030
哦 这太夸张了
Okay, that's crazy.

870
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,326
那他只是拍了一下你的屁股...
So, did he just slap that ass 

871
01:11:28,409 --> 01:11:30,536
还是抓着不放?
or did he grab and hold on to it?

872
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:35,041
嗯 这会管用的
Hey, this will work.

873
01:11:35,583 --> 01:11:36,751
真了不起
I'm impressed.

874
01:11:36,876 --> 01:11:37,877
行了吗?
Got it? 

875
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,003
行了
Got it.

876
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:40,755
可是你还没回答问题
But you still didn't answer the question.

877
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:46,677
"通缉要犯,极度危险"

878
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:49,096
哦 不 兄弟们 大势不妙
Oh, no. Guys, guys! Guys, we have a problem.

879
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,931
我们的身份全都曝光了
The whole team just got burnt.

880
01:11:52,933 --> 01:11:54,852
大家都被通缉了
Now we're all wanted.

881
01:11:56,937 --> 01:11:57,938
怎么会这样?
How did this happen?

882
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,734
美国外交安全局发出的通缉令
US Diplomatic Security Service issued the warrants.

883
01:12:01,901 --> 01:12:03,611
霍布斯探员
Agent L. Hobbs.

884
01:12:04,070 --> 01:12:05,071
等一下
Hold on one second.

885
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:07,198
喂 多姆
Hey, Dom.

886
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,618
那是你在贫民区看到的家伙吗?
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

887
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,538
对
Yeah.

888
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:18,417
霍布斯是外交安全局精英特遣队的队长
Hobbs is the leader of the elite task force for the DSS.

889
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:19,710
他很厉害
So he's good.

890
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:22,755
FBI要想找人的时候 都会找他帮忙
When the FBI wants to find somebody, that's who they call.

891
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,590
因为他从来没有失过手
Because he never misses his mark.

892
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,635
这个家伙是个实力派
This guy is Old Testament.

893
01:12:27,802 --> 01:12:31,055
充满杀气 荷枪实弹 勇往直前 这就是他的风格
Blood, bullets, wrath of God. That's his style.

894
01:12:31,222 --> 01:12:33,557
而现在他正在追捕我们?
And right now he's hunting us?

895
01:12:33,724 --> 01:12:35,559
多姆 我们得提前行动
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

896
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:36,769
对 该怎么做?
Yeah, but how?

897
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:40,272
这情况即便没有这位执法悍将 也够伤脑筋的了
This thing's already been difficult without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

898
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:42,814
要说需要的话 那就是更多呼吸的空间
If anything, we need more room to breathe.

899
01:12:44,985 --> 01:12:46,445
罗曼说得对
Roman's right.

900
01:12:49,281 --> 01:12:51,659
我们真的需要呼吸些新鲜的空气了
Think we need to get some fresh air.

901
01:12:52,952 --> 01:12:55,287
"嫌犯已定位,大西洋大道东向"

902
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,623
找到 70年的道奇跑车
We've got a hit. '70s Charger.

903
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,792
马上行动!
Let's get a move on!

904
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:05,589
正在亚特兰克大街向东行驶
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

905
01:13:05,756 --> 01:13:07,466
赶快,快!
Move, move, move, move!

906
01:13:13,597 --> 01:13:15,182
它停下了 就在前面一条街
It stopped about a block ahead.

907
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,309
停车 我们走过去
Park it. We're going on foot.

908
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:41,709
嘿 托雷多
Hey, Toretto.

909
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,510
你被捕了
You're under arrest.

910
01:13:51,719 --> 01:13:52,887
被捕了?
Arrest?

911
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:56,015
我怎么没有被捕的感觉呀
I don't feel like I'm under arrest.

912
01:13:56,807 --> 01:13:57,975
你呢 布莱恩?
How about you, Brian?

913
01:13:58,142 --> 01:13:59,351
是的 没感觉
No, not a bit.

914
01:14:01,187 --> 01:14:02,354
一点感觉都没有
Not even a little bit.

915
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,857
再等一会儿 就有感觉了
Just give it a minute. It'll sink in.

916
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:10,654
我们没杀那些联邦探员 是雷耶斯的手下干的
We didn't kill those feds. That was Reyes.

917
01:14:10,821 --> 01:14:12,072
我才不管这么多
I don't give a shit.

918
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,992
我只是依法缉拿两名混蛋归案
I'm just here to bring in two assholes whose names hit my desk.

919
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:18,537
是嘛 听上去就象个真正的英雄
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

920
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:23,000
真有意思
That's funny.

921
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:26,253
这话竟出自曾为警察 却背叛自己誓言的人
From a guy who took the oath of a cop, then went against everything it stood for.

922
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,005
还有这位想要充当硬汉的...
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

923
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,549
用扳手把人打个半死的鸟人
who beat a man half to death with a socket wrench.

924
01:14:31,217 --> 01:14:32,426
对...确实够硬
Yeah, real tough.

925
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:36,680
转过身 把手放在背后
You turn around and put your hands behind your back.

926
01:14:37,848 --> 01:14:39,183
我看不必吧
I don't think so.

927
01:14:39,350 --> 01:14:42,019
要是你觉得还有得选 那你就错了
Your mistake is thinking you got a goddamn choice, boy.

928
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:47,733
你弄错了吧?
And your mistake?

929
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,944
你以为这是在美国啊
Thinking you're in America.

930
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:56,534
你离老家远着呢
You're a long way from home.

931
01:14:58,953 --> 01:15:01,539
这里可是巴西
This is Brazil.

932
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,931
好了 老大 改天吧
Come on, boss. Another day.

933
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:23,227
走吧 嘿 对方火力太强
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

934
01:15:28,232 --> 01:15:30,484
我们很快会再见面 托雷多
I'll see you soon, Toretto.

935
01:15:31,777 --> 01:15:34,655
我很期待 长官
I look forward to it, cop.

936
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:12,902
.
Yep.

937
01:16:13,152 --> 01:16:14,361
追踪器启动了
Tracker's on.

938
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:16,739
收到讯号了
Got them.

939
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:18,699
"追踪器已定位"

940
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,391
我不明白 你干嘛来这儿?
I don't understand. Why come here?

941
01:17:26,058 --> 01:17:28,894
就为了一条20美元的银链子?
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

942
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,565
因为它值得我冒险
Because it's worth it.

943
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:38,904
你应该赶紧逃远点
You should run, you know.

944
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:41,073
霍布斯会找到你的
Hobbs will find you.

945
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,494
你没有理由不离开
You have every reason to leave. 

946
01:17:45,577 --> 01:17:46,954
为什么留下?
Why stay?

947
01:17:54,128 --> 01:17:56,213
那你呢?
Why do you?

948
01:17:57,798 --> 01:18:00,050
我丈夫曾是名优秀的警察
My husband was a good police officer.

949
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:03,053
一个正直的男人
An honest man.

950
01:18:03,721 --> 01:18:05,597
我们都在这里长大
We both grew up here.

951
01:18:06,432 --> 01:18:08,809
两年前他在大街上被枪杀了...
Two years ago he was murdered in the street

952
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:10,728
就在我家门口
right outside our door.

953
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:15,399
雷耶斯掌控了贫民区
Reyes owns this favela now. 

954
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:17,109
他给人们发放东西
He gives things to people.

955
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:21,613
但是天下没有免费的午餐
But everything has a price.

956
01:18:24,324 --> 01:18:26,076
这里的人需要新的生活
The people here need a new start.

957
01:18:26,452 --> 01:18:28,245
他们需要获得自由
They need to be free.

958
01:18:37,838 --> 01:18:39,673
你没有杀死火车上的探员...
You didn't kill those men in the train,

959
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:41,967
对吧?
did you?

960
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:48,974
你为什么要相信我说的话?
Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you?

961
01:18:55,688 --> 01:18:56,980
嘿!
Hey!

962
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:02,279
她对你来说这么特别?
Was she so special to you?

963
01:19:06,825 --> 01:19:09,328
我从未期望有人理解她对我有多重要
I never thought anyone could understand how much.

964
01:19:12,498 --> 01:19:14,291
但是你理解
But you do.

965
01:19:37,229 --> 01:19:38,229
没错!
Yeah!

966
01:19:49,368 --> 01:19:51,078
很接近 但是还不够
Close, but not enough.

967
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:52,746
多姆 时间实在太短了
Dom, the window is too small, man.

968
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:56,917
要想战胜摄像头 只有开隐形车了
Only way we're going to beat the cameras is with invisible cars.

969
01:19:59,336 --> 01:20:02,047
我正好知道上哪去搞隐形车 
And I know just where to get them.

970
01:20:05,008 --> 01:20:06,385
咱们去兜风吧 伙计们
Let's take a ride, boys.

971
01:20:14,059 --> 01:20:16,353
各自都小心点儿
Don't hurt yourself.

972
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:37,291
我已经好久没开警车了
It's been a while since I've been behind the wheel of one of these.

973
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:39,543
我还是第一次坐在前排
First time I've ever been in the front seat.

974
01:20:47,259 --> 01:20:48,802
罗曼 你怎么这么久?
Rome, what took you so long?

975
01:20:49,052 --> 01:20:52,890
我以为你去换镀铬轮鼓了
I thought for sure you'd be showing up with some chrome spinners or something.

976
01:20:53,974 --> 01:20:55,183
一点都不好笑
Real funny.

977
01:20:56,393 --> 01:21:00,230
我赌十万我能在1/4英里内赢你们
I got $100,000 that says I can take you all in the next quarter-mile.

978
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:01,940
你都穷得屁股开花了 哪来的十万美元
Yeah, your broke ass has got a hundred grand.

979
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:04,401
干了这一票我就会有
If we pull off this job, I will.

980
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,153
跑完两个红绿灯...
The next two lights.

981
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:07,613
十万美元
Hundred thousand.

982
01:21:08,405 --> 01:21:11,325
我们不拿下这一票 我们大概都活不成了
We don't pull this job off, we're probably dead anyway.

983
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:13,952
赌一百万吧
Let's make it a million.

984
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:17,164
我喜欢 好吧 就赌一百万 1/4英里
I like that. All right, a million-dollar quarter-mile.

985
01:21:18,248 --> 01:21:19,791
那好吧
All right, then.

986
01:21:19,958 --> 01:21:22,794
人生只有一次 就这样吧
You only live once. Let's do it.

987
01:21:23,086 --> 01:21:24,338
你说呢 多姆?
What do you say, Dom?

988
01:21:24,796 --> 01:21:26,465
我们怎能光说不练?
We talking or we racing?

989
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:29,092
这次可别作弊
Just don't cheat this time.

990
01:21:29,635 --> 01:21:32,262
你还真记仇啊
Got to let that go.

991
01:21:50,696 --> 01:21:52,155
耶
Yeah!

992
01:21:54,910 --> 01:21:56,411
还是那套 罗曼
Typical, Roman.

993
01:21:56,578 --> 01:21:58,997
这次我赢定了 我有强烈的预感
I'm going to get this money. I'm hungry.

994
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,007
别让我赢得太轻松 伙计们
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

995
01:22:11,802 --> 01:22:12,803
不!
No!

996
01:22:14,096 --> 01:22:16,098
这回可不行 多姆
Not this time, Dom.

997
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:22,354
你要有好胜心才行 布莱恩
You got to want it, Brian.

998
01:22:50,549 --> 01:22:54,386
耶!赢了!赢你了!
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

999
01:23:08,984 --> 01:23:10,485
开得不错 奥康纳
Good race, O'Conner.

1000
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,362
那是当然 多姆
Thanks, Dom.

1001
01:23:13,238 --> 01:23:15,907
你知道这一刻我等了多久吗?
Do you know how long I've been waiting for that shit?

1002
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:18,160
我就说他不知道
I told you he didn't see it.

1003
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:19,995
你说你赢了他?
Your man right there?

1004
01:23:20,162 --> 01:23:22,372
他在冲刺的时候松油门了 
He let off the throttle at the line.

1005
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:23,832
你根本就没赢
You didn't do nothing. 

1006
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,250
是他让你赢的
He let you win.

1007
01:23:26,251 --> 01:23:27,586
鬼扯
Bullshit.

1008
01:23:49,274 --> 01:23:50,609
文斯,你在干嘛?
Vince, what are you doing? 

1009
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:52,069
安静点!他们在跟踪你
Quiet! They've been tracking you.

1010
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:01,620
我就知道她在这儿!
I know she's here!

1011
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,499
找到她!
Find her!

1012
01:24:05,665 --> 01:24:07,250
快!快!
Go! Go! Go!

1013
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,141
没关系 等一下
It's okay. Wait!

1014
01:24:23,308 --> 01:24:26,353
雷耶斯的人在市场那边等着我 
Reyes' guys were waiting for me at the market.

1015
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:28,980
文斯救了我
Vince saved my life.

1016
01:24:34,361 --> 01:24:35,821
你饿了吗?
DOM: You hungry?

1017
01:24:38,824 --> 01:24:39,991
饿了
Yeah, sure. 

1018
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:41,493
很好
Good.

1019
01:24:42,828 --> 01:24:44,496
因为你要说祷词
Because you're saying grace.

1020
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:49,042
谢了,文斯
Thanks, Vince.

1021
01:24:55,632 --> 01:24:56,675
你把肉烤焦了!
Yo, you burned it!

1022
01:24:56,842 --> 01:25:00,220
我妈妈就是这么烤的 别激动 
Yo, this is how my momma does it. Relax.

1023
01:25:00,387 --> 01:25:02,681
是啊 可是你妈是世上最烂的厨师
Yeah, but your mom is the worst cook in the world.

1024
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:05,684
不准你说我妈的坏话
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

1025
01:25:07,686 --> 01:25:10,147
来吧 伙计们 来享受生活吧
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

1026
01:25:10,355 --> 01:25:12,482
敬你们 兄弟 干杯 干杯 干杯
To you, bro. Cheers, cheers, cheers.

1027
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,818
我们既然在巴西 就得享受这里的好生活 
So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

1028
01:25:14,901 --> 01:25:15,944
对
Yeah.

1029
01:25:16,027 --> 01:25:19,489
我们很快就会有上千万入账了 
So, you got a little more than $10 or $11 million coming.

1030
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:20,824
你打算怎么花?
What you going to do with your money?

1031
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:21,950
我?
Me? 

1032
01:25:22,033 --> 01:25:22,993
对
Yeah.

1033
01:25:23,076 --> 01:25:25,871
老实说 我想回老家开家修车行
Actually, man, I been thinking about opening up a garage back home.

1034
01:25:26,371 --> 01:25:29,332
一个大家把车送修却不被欺诈的地方
Place where people can bring their cars and not get completely ripped off.

1035
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:30,542
你懂我的意思吗?
You know what I mean?

1036
01:25:30,709 --> 01:25:31,918
- 真的假的? - 真的
- Really? - Yeah.

1037
01:25:32,085 --> 01:25:35,046
你的梦想就是开始一份新工作?修车工?
So, your dream is to start a day job?

1038
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:37,174
那可真蠢 你怎么不...
That's stupid. Like, why would...

1039
01:25:37,340 --> 01:25:39,384
不 一点都不蠢 我喜欢修车
No, it's not stupid at all. I love what I do.

1040
01:25:39,551 --> 01:25:40,886
我一点都不理解 
That don't make no sense to me.

1041
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:43,722
我知道我要怎么花这笔钱
I know what I'm going to do with my money.

1042
01:25:45,891 --> 01:25:47,851
付钱让我的兄弟上厨艺班
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

1043
01:25:48,101 --> 01:25:49,728
看到了吧?看到了吧?
See? See?

1044
01:25:49,895 --> 01:25:51,897
你又往坏处想了
There you go with that negativity, man.

1045
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:54,232
你了解我 钱财乃身外之物
You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

1046
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:56,860
想学好厨艺 光有钱是不行的
It's going to take a little more than money to learn how to cook.

1047
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,236
这确实很糟糕
That's horrible.

1048
01:25:58,612 --> 01:26:02,407
不过我听说动物收容所正在招厨师
But I heard they was looking for a chef down at this animal shelter.

1049
01:26:02,574 --> 01:26:03,575
你可以去...
You might want to...

1050
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:05,410
我认识那个经理
I know the manager.

1051
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,542
嗨 多姆
Hey, Dom.

1052
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:16,463
听我说...
Listen.

1053
01:26:17,214 --> 01:26:20,926
我知道明天这一票都安排好了
I know that you're all set for this job tomorrow,

1054
01:26:21,092 --> 01:26:22,928
但如果你还需要人手 我可以...
but if you need an extra man, I could...

1055
01:26:23,094 --> 01:26:24,429
你可以加入
You're in.

1056
01:26:32,729 --> 01:26:34,481
大门永远向家人敞开
There's always room for family.

1057
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:41,905
谢谢你
Thank you.

1058
01:26:46,326 --> 01:26:47,744
去吃东西吧
Get something to eat.

1059
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:50,914
好
Yeah.

1060
01:26:52,791 --> 01:26:54,751
你相信吗 米娅说这车不吉利?
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

1061
01:26:58,296 --> 01:27:00,465
她也许是对的
She might be right.

1062
01:27:04,803 --> 01:27:07,305
你真的很喜欢玩枪 是吗?
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

1063
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:10,016
当你的生命随时有危险...
When your life is on the line 

1064
01:27:10,183 --> 01:27:11,977
你才会更了解自己
that's when you learn about yourself.

1065
01:27:16,481 --> 01:27:18,692
那倒是公平的说法
That's a fair deal.

1066
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,238
24小时以后...
We're less than 24 hours 

1067
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:25,991
就是我们一生中最大的庆典
from the biggest celebration of our life.

1068
01:27:26,157 --> 01:27:28,326
你们得再来一杯 这次是来真的
Y'all need a refill. This is serious stuff.

1069
01:27:28,493 --> 01:27:29,703
- 不 我不喝了 - 干杯 宝贝
- No, I'm good. - Cheers, baby.

1070
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,496
我不喝了 不了 谢谢
I'm good. No, thank you.

1071
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:32,664
不 她不能喝
No, she can't.

1072
01:27:34,457 --> 01:27:35,500
你什么意思?
What do you mean? 

1073
01:27:35,584 --> 01:27:36,710
她不能喝酒
She can't.

1074
01:27:36,876 --> 01:27:38,211
那是什么意思?她不能喝酒
What do you mean she can't?

1075
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:39,504
什么?
What is...

1076
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,844
你是说真的?
Are you serious right now?

1077
01:27:46,344 --> 01:27:49,681
所以你才会故意让他赢你?
Is that the reason you let him beat you in the quarter-mile?

1078
01:27:51,391 --> 01:27:52,517
那是给宝宝的礼金!
That was a baby gift. 

1079
01:27:52,684 --> 01:27:54,519
不 你搞错了
No, that's messed up.

1080
01:27:54,686 --> 01:27:56,229
不 我是真的赢了他
No, you're not taking that from me.

1081
01:27:56,396 --> 01:27:58,064
等等...等一下
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

1082
01:27:58,231 --> 01:28:00,483
所以他是拍你屁股...
So, did he just smack the ass 

1083
01:28:00,567 --> 01:28:02,485
还是抓着不放?
or did he grab and hold on to it?

1084
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:03,695
到底是怎样?
Which one was it?

1085
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:05,155
恭喜了
Congratulations. 

1086
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:06,281
谢谢你
Thank you.

1087
01:28:06,364 --> 01:28:07,657
你怎么可以瞒着大家呢?
How can you keep this a secret?

1088
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:08,950
很疯狂 是吧?
Crazy, huh? 

1089
01:28:09,034 --> 01:28:10,368
那可是你的孩子啊
It's your boy.

1090
01:28:10,535 --> 01:28:13,913
这种事你干嘛瞒着我不说?
Why would you keep something like that away from me?

1091
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,874
宝宝的礼金?
Baby gift, huh?

1092
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:19,002
我根本不知道他们在说什么
I have no idea what they're talking about. Oh?

1093
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:21,713
你忘了拔出来再射吗?
What happened to the pull-out method, man?

1094
01:28:23,548 --> 01:28:25,592
干杯
Toast. Toast.

1095
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,895
大家都知道 钱财生不带来 死不带去
Money will come and go. We know that.

1096
01:28:37,854 --> 01:28:41,608
人生最重要的事情大家能够聚在一起
But the most important thing in life will always be the people in this room.

1097
01:28:42,776 --> 01:28:44,402
就在这里
Right here.

1098
01:28:46,696 --> 01:28:48,073
此时此刻
Right now.

1099
01:29:02,379 --> 01:29:03,922
我准备好了
I'm all set.

1100
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:07,926
桑托 厢型车准备好了吗?
Yo, Santos. Van good?

1101
01:29:09,219 --> 01:29:11,429
我们早就准备好了
You know we're always good, bro.

1102
01:29:15,141 --> 01:29:17,727
霍布斯在市区的另一边
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

1103
01:29:17,894 --> 01:29:20,438
没有比这更好的机会了 
We're not going to get a better window.

1104
01:29:20,605 --> 01:29:22,774
好了,伙计们 好戏开场 
Okay, guys, it's show time!

1105
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:24,609
第一组就位 准备出发 
First team in position, let's go.

1106
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,069
来吧 咱们大干一场吧
Come on, let's do this.

1107
01:29:38,289 --> 01:29:39,290
嗨 多姆
Hey, Dom.

1108
01:29:40,959 --> 01:29:42,419
我会保护米娅的
I got eyes on Mia.

1109
01:29:46,965 --> 01:29:50,677
莫斯科 巴厘岛 果阿 香港
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

1110
01:29:50,844 --> 01:29:52,804
它们有什么共同点?
And what do they all have in common?

1111
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:54,097
没有引渡条约
No extradition.

1112
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:58,518
一小时后就能共度余生了
We're one hour away from the rest of our lives.

1113
01:29:58,685 --> 01:29:59,978
是啊
Yeah.

1114
01:30:01,855 --> 01:30:02,981
条子!
Cops!

1115
01:30:05,483 --> 01:30:06,901
快跑
Come on. Go.

1116
01:30:18,371 --> 01:30:20,206
你刚犯了一个天大的错误
You just made a big mistake.

1117
01:30:21,458 --> 01:30:23,668
找追踪器费我了不少劲
Took me a while to find that tracking chip.

1118
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:25,378
可找接收器就简单得多了
But not as long to flip the receiver.

1119
01:30:25,545 --> 01:30:27,046
你跑不了了 托雷多 
You're going down, Toretto.

1120
01:30:27,213 --> 01:30:29,215
我就在这里
I'm right here.

1121
01:32:01,042 --> 01:32:01,685
多姆!
Dom!

1122
01:32:01,768 --> 01:32:03,145
退后 让我来
Stand back. I got this.

1123
01:32:11,717 --> 01:32:12,718
住手!
Pull off! 

1124
01:32:12,801 --> 01:32:15,637
- 多姆! - 求你了 住手!
- Dom! - Please, stop!

1125
01:32:21,268 --> 01:32:22,269
多姆!
Dom!

1126
01:32:31,445 --> 01:32:32,446
多姆!
Dom!

1127
01:33:35,300 --> 01:33:36,343
是的
Yeah.

1128
01:33:37,553 --> 01:33:39,513
我们马上就到
We're coming in now.

1129
01:33:41,056 --> 01:33:44,017
请执法官在机场等我们
Have the marshals meet us at the airport when we land.

1130
01:33:51,817 --> 01:33:53,193
有埋伏!
Ambush!

1131
01:34:10,836 --> 01:34:14,047
威尔克斯 压制火力 干掉他们!
Wilkes, suppression fire. Shut them down.

1132
01:34:18,260 --> 01:34:19,928
交叉前进 掩护我
Stagger-step. Cover me.

1133
01:34:24,808 --> 01:34:26,018
看好他们!
Watch them!

1134
01:34:37,571 --> 01:34:38,572
放开我们!
Cut us loose!

1135
01:34:38,739 --> 01:34:40,741
快啊!放开我们!
Come on! Cut us loose!

1136
01:36:48,802 --> 01:36:50,179
- 人齐了吗? - 是的 开车!快!
- We're good? - Yeah, let's go, let's go!

1137
01:37:23,400 --> 01:37:25,027
嘿 多姆
Hey, Dom.

1138
01:37:31,075 --> 01:37:33,494
你要去看看我的儿子
You've got to meet my son.

1139
01:37:33,661 --> 01:37:35,663
尼克
Nico.

1140
01:37:40,125 --> 01:37:41,794
我会的
I will.

1141
01:37:44,421 --> 01:37:45,965
他是个乖孩子
He's a good kid.

1142
01:37:49,510 --> 01:37:52,471
我们以你的名字替他命名
You know, we named him after you.

1143
01:37:54,014 --> 01:37:55,349
多米尼克
"Dominic."

1144
01:38:02,564 --> 01:38:04,566
我向你保证 文斯
You've got my word, Vince.

1145
01:38:11,115 --> 01:38:13,200
你永远都是我的兄弟
You were always my brother.

1146
01:38:22,835 --> 01:38:25,379
我会照顾尼克
I got eyes on Nico now.

1147
01:38:36,056 --> 01:38:38,559
我们得走了 时间不多了
We need to move. We don't have that much time.

1148
01:38:38,726 --> 01:38:39,810
我订了机票
I got us a flight out.

1149
01:38:39,977 --> 01:38:42,438
五小时后我们就可以离开里约了
We can leave Rio in the rearview in the next five hours.

1150
01:38:42,604 --> 01:38:44,398
还不能逃走...
Not to run away.

1151
01:38:45,566 --> 01:38:47,401
先把活干完了
To finish the job.

1152
01:38:47,985 --> 01:38:50,738
你疯了吗 多姆?我们不能干了
Are you crazy, Dom? We can't.

1153
01:38:51,071 --> 01:38:52,906
这可是自杀式任务
It's a suicide mission.

1154
01:38:53,699 --> 01:38:55,659
你的兄弟倒在桌子上了
That's your man over there on the table.

1155
01:38:56,952 --> 01:38:58,871
整个计划泡汤了!
The plan is busted!

1156
01:38:59,038 --> 01:39:01,790
这是胡闹 兄弟 雷耶斯知道我们要来!
This is bullshit, man. Reyes knows we're coming!

1157
01:39:01,957 --> 01:39:03,125
他说得对
He's right.

1158
01:39:03,292 --> 01:39:06,211
警局的警力多了三倍
They tripled the detail at the police station.

1159
01:39:06,378 --> 01:39:08,630
迎接我们的是枪林弹雨
It's going to be a wall of gunfire.

1160
01:39:11,008 --> 01:39:13,302
我不会放过雷耶斯
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

1161
01:39:13,469 --> 01:39:14,636
这是陷阱 伙计
It's a trap, man.

1162
01:39:14,803 --> 01:39:16,388
你很清楚
You know that.

1163
01:39:16,555 --> 01:39:19,391
多姆 听他们的
Dom, listen to them.

1164
01:39:19,558 --> 01:39:21,560
趁现在还来得及 快离开吧
Run, before it's too late. 

1165
01:39:21,643 --> 01:39:22,728
离开里约
Leave Rio.

1166
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,189
你就自由了
You can be free.

1167
01:39:26,982 --> 01:39:28,984
逃走不等于自由
Running ain't freedom.

1168
01:39:30,486 --> 01:39:32,196
你应该知道这一点
You should know that.

1169
01:39:36,909 --> 01:39:39,661
你们自己做出选择吧
You know you're all free to make your own choices.

1170
01:39:43,415 --> 01:39:45,042
我加入
I'm in.

1171
01:39:54,134 --> 01:39:56,011
我跟你一起去 托雷托
I'll ride with you, Toretto.

1172
01:39:59,014 --> 01:40:01,809
至少先把那狗杂种干掉
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

1173
01:40:09,900 --> 01:40:11,902
你有什么计划 多姆?
So what's the plan, Dom?

1174
01:40:12,403 --> 01:40:14,780
我们不能再东躲西藏了
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

1175
01:40:15,948 --> 01:40:17,908
我们不躲了
We don't sneak.

1176
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:21,954
他唯一在乎的就是他的钱
The only thing he cares about is his money.

1177
01:40:22,121 --> 01:40:24,289
我们拉走他的钱...
We pull that,

1178
01:40:24,456 --> 01:40:26,500
...他就会跟上来
we pull him.

1179
01:40:32,172 --> 01:40:34,591
"警察总部"

1180
01:40:42,933 --> 01:40:44,536
瞧?
See?

1181
01:40:45,727 --> 01:40:48,355
我召集了全局的所有警察
I called in every cop on our payroll.

1182
01:40:49,857 --> 01:40:51,650
我们戒备森严
We're covered.

1183
01:40:53,360 --> 01:40:54,695
每道出口都有武装小组把守
We've got every entrance covered with weapons teams.

1184
01:40:54,862 --> 01:40:57,739
即使是上帝也别想拿走你的钱
God Himself couldn't get at your money if He wanted to.

1185
01:40:58,115 --> 01:41:02,452
我担心的不是上帝
God isn't my worry.

1186
01:41:12,212 --> 01:41:13,255
准备好了吗?
You ready?

1187
01:41:15,424 --> 01:41:16,550
准备好了
I'm ready.

1188
01:42:14,524 --> 01:42:15,943
怎么回事?
What's happening?

1189
01:42:16,068 --> 01:42:17,361
他们要抢金库!
They're taking the vault!

1190
01:42:17,444 --> 01:42:18,445
什么?
What? 

1191
01:42:18,529 --> 01:42:19,529
金库!
The vault!

1192
01:42:28,830 --> 01:42:32,125
跟我来!快!
Follow me! Quickly!

1193
01:42:36,463 --> 01:42:37,965
让开!
Let me through!

1194
01:42:47,891 --> 01:42:48,976
别动!
Don't move!

1195
01:42:50,185 --> 01:42:51,561
趴在地上
Stay down.

1196
01:43:21,508 --> 01:43:22,843
呼叫米娅!
Call it out, Mia!

1197
01:43:23,010 --> 01:43:24,553
你们直走 穿过两条街
You've got a straight shot for two blocks.

1198
01:43:25,762 --> 01:43:26,805
右转
Go right. 

1199
01:43:26,888 --> 01:43:27,889
收到
Got it.

1200
01:43:49,870 --> 01:43:52,122
看 计划奏效了
Well, the plan is working.

1201
01:43:52,289 --> 01:43:54,666
里约的所有腐败警察都在追你们
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio on your tail.

1202
01:43:54,750 --> 01:43:56,251
你们必须开快点
You have to move fast.

1203
01:43:56,543 --> 01:43:57,711
最佳路线是什么?
What's the best route?

1204
01:43:57,878 --> 01:44:00,631
嗯 继续直行半英里 到丰塞卡路...
Okay, keep going straight another half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

1205
01:44:01,048 --> 01:44:03,050
...然后左转
and then go left.

1206
01:44:06,720 --> 01:44:07,721
看来行不通
That ain't going to work.

1207
01:44:09,806 --> 01:44:11,475
前方有尖刺 多姆 有尖刺!
Spikes ahead, Dom. We got spikes!

1208
01:44:11,642 --> 01:44:13,477
我们要右转!
We're going right!

1209
01:44:14,770 --> 01:44:16,063
不行 太窄了 转不过去
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

1210
01:44:16,229 --> 01:44:17,648
别无选择 快!
We've got no choice. Now!

1211
01:44:37,292 --> 01:44:38,460
该死!
Shit!

1212
01:44:44,925 --> 01:44:46,301
真该死!
Holy shit!

1213
01:44:46,468 --> 01:44:47,636
伙计们 我听着怎么这么吵
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter. 

1214
01:44:47,761 --> 01:44:49,429
你们是不是把银行拖出来了?
Did you just take out a bank?

1215
01:44:58,397 --> 01:44:59,439
两条巷子!
Two inbound!

1216
01:45:01,691 --> 01:45:02,984
好的 往左拐有一条小胡同
All right, there's an alley coming up on your left.

1217
01:45:03,151 --> 01:45:04,152
是的 收到
Yeah, I got it.

1218
01:45:58,415 --> 01:46:00,041
你这混蛋!
You little bastard!

1219
01:46:23,190 --> 01:46:25,901
好 干得好 多姆 向右转 就现在 向右转
All right, good job, Dom. Right-hander, right here, right-hander.

1220
01:46:32,282 --> 01:46:34,701
伙计们 又有大队人马从南边向你们过来了
Guys, there's a big group coming at you from the south.

1221
01:46:34,868 --> 01:46:36,286
你们得快想办法!
You have to do something now!

1222
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:40,207
分开点
Hey, go wide.

1223
01:47:12,967 --> 01:47:13,967
耶!
Yeah!

1224
01:48:27,772 --> 01:48:29,107
左方安全
You're all clear on the left.

1225
01:48:29,274 --> 01:48:31,109
下午好 警官 
Good afternoon, officer!

1226
01:48:32,986 --> 01:48:35,363
请你出示驾照进行车辆登记!
License and registration, please!

1227
01:48:41,620 --> 01:48:44,372
耶!这才是男人该干的事情!
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!

1228
01:48:44,539 --> 01:48:46,041
右侧安全
We're clear on the right.

1229
01:48:46,207 --> 01:48:47,334
喔 伙计
Oh, man.

1230
01:48:54,132 --> 01:48:55,216
谢谢你们
Thanks guys.

1231
01:48:55,508 --> 01:48:56,635
别客气
Any time.

1232
01:48:56,718 --> 01:48:58,178
另一边再见
I'll see you on the other side.

1233
01:48:58,345 --> 01:49:00,847
你们只有十秒钟时间
You guys just carved out a 10-second window.

1234
01:49:01,014 --> 01:49:02,474
好好把握!
Make it count!

1235
01:49:08,688 --> 01:49:11,042
快点 跟紧他们
Zizi, stay on them.

1236
01:49:37,550 --> 01:49:39,427
他们不可能在桥上甩掉我们
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

1237
01:49:41,137 --> 01:49:42,222
该死!
Shit.

1238
01:49:49,521 --> 01:49:50,730
他们无路可走了
They have no way out.

1239
01:49:52,649 --> 01:49:53,692
不!
No!

1240
01:49:54,526 --> 01:49:55,527
他们人太多了
There's too many of them.

1241
01:49:55,694 --> 01:49:57,737
嘿 他们人太多了 我们无法通过
Hey, there's too many of them. We're not going to make it.

1242
01:50:01,408 --> 01:50:02,450
你说得对 我们不能
You're right, we aren't.

1243
01:50:03,535 --> 01:50:04,703
你能
You are.

1244
01:50:04,869 --> 01:50:06,079
你在说什么?
What are you talking about?

1245
01:50:06,246 --> 01:50:08,581
丢下金库 赶快逃走
Just let the vault go. Get out of there.

1246
01:50:08,748 --> 01:50:10,291
你现在是个父亲了 布莱恩
You're a father now, Brian.

1247
01:50:10,458 --> 01:50:12,627
不 我不会丢下你 要按计划行事!
No, I'm not leaving you. Now you stick with the plan!

1248
01:50:13,378 --> 01:50:14,754
这一直就是我的计划
It was always the plan.

1249
01:50:15,463 --> 01:50:16,715
照顾好米娅
Take care of Mia.

1250
01:50:16,881 --> 01:50:19,259
多姆 听我说 好吗?
