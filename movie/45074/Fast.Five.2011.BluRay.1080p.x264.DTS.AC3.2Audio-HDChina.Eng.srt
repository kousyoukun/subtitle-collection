1
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,830
Dominic Toretto.

2
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,710
You are hereby sentenced to serve 25 years to life

3
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,710
at the Lompoc Maximum Security Prison system

4
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:48,800
without the possibility of early parole.

5
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,450
Here's what we know so far.

6
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,040
This is all the aftermath of a daring, daylight breakout.

7
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,210
There were 26 high-risk inmates being transferred...

8
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,880
where everyone on board has been accounted for,

9
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,670
except for one, Dominic Toretto.

10
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
Police have just released the identity

11
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,300
of the man they believe to have orchestrated the shocking escape

12
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:21,050
that amazingly resulted in no fatalities this afternoon.

13
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:24,020
He is former federal agent, Brian O'Conner.

14
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,060
A fierce manhunt is underway for three fugitives tonight.

15
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,980
Multiple federal and local agencies have joined forces

16
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,650
in the search for Dominic Toretto

17
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,980
and his accomplices Brian O'Conner and Mia Toretto.

18
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,740
But despite every eye in the country looking for them

19
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,450
where Toretto and O'Conner are now is anyone's guess.

20
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,570
It's got to be it, right?

21
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,930
Let's get out of here.

22
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,180
Easy, friends.

23
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,510
She's with me.

24
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,100
Mia.

25
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,690
Vince.

26
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Buster.

27
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,860
Come on.

28
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,780
Dom here yet?

29
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,120
No.

30
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,870
When was the last time you heard from him?

31
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,040
A couple of weeks ago. Up in Ecuador somewhere.

32
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,630
- How does it feel? - What's that?

33
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,550
To be on the other side of a wanted poster?

34
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,800
He'll show up.

35
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,310
Dom's?

36
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,690
Time for bed little one.

37
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,320
Can I bring him?

38
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,360
Of course.

39
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,740
Good night.

40
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,430
Excuse me, sorry.

41
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,190
Why Rio, Vince?

42
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:02,610
You mean after you screwed everything up in LA?

43
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,860
Ended up free-falling through South America, you know,

44
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:11,080
hitting every hellhole on the way down.

45
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,620
Would have kept on going if not for Rosa.

46
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,310
Does he know?

47
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,940
So, listen.

48
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,240
There is a job coming up.

49
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,240
I was hoping Dom was going to be here by now

50
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,830
but this one is clean enough we can do it without him.

51
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:01,130
It's a good gig. Couple of high-end cars, easy targets.

52
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:05,170
Guy I know is putting together a team to swipe them.

53
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,550
Just need a few more willing bodies.

54
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,430
I don't know.

55
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:12,180
Look, the way the car scene is down here

56
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,220
we can unload them quick and get top dollar.

57
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,350
It's easy money.

58
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,690
And from where I'm sitting,

59
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,940
it looks like you both could use the payday.

60
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,650
What are you reading?

61
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,610
Travel guide.

62
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,230
Yeah?

63
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,610
Tokyo.

64
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,450
Moscow.

65
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Goa.

66
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,750
You want to know what all of these places have in common?

67
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,080
Huh?

68
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,420
No extradition.

69
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,890
Here we go.

70
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:01,160
Excuse me, buddy.

71
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,050
Okay.

72
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,990
Hey, we've found them.

73
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,830
Yeah, second-to-the-last freighter.

74
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,840
What is it?

75
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,550
DEA tags. These cars have been seized.

76
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,510
Look who showed up.

77
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:46,100
God, I'm so happy you're okay.

78
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,600
I thought I told you to lay low.

79
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:53,230
Been running on fumes. Had to make a call.

80
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,610
Hey! Quit talking. We only got the two-minute window.

81
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,070
Let's go, Vince.

82
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,660
I'm taking the GT40.

83
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,780
Ladies first.

84
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:52,750
This car suits me better.

85
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,090
See you, baby.

86
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,230
It's okay... we're all going to the same place.

87
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:12,060
We'll get the car there.

88
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,400
Change of plans. Wait for my call.

89
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,910
Let's go!

90
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,380
Where is she going?

91
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:46,850
Where is she going? Hey!

92
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:57,480
We're being robbed! Whatever happens, don't stop the train!

93
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,780
Go after the girl!

94
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,490
Hurry up!

95
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,100
Access card! Get the access card!

96
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,970
Shit.

97
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:14,950
Bridge! There is a bridge!

98
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,640
Luggage car is clear.

99
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,690
Freeze!

100
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,080
Oh, Shit!

101
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,610
You had to make a call, huh?

102
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,410
Shitty call, O'Conner.

103
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,530
Shitty call.

104
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,180
You two stirred up quite a bit of trouble today.

105
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:44,390
Three of my men dead.

106
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,850
Three DEA agents along with them.

107
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,860
Of course,

108
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:52,070
this is business and sometimes things go astray.

109
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,530
All I care about is the car.

110
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,870
Tell me where it is, and I'll let you go.

111
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,750
This roofing plastic says you're full of shit.

112
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:08,290
I don't know how you guys do business in your part of the world,

113
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,420
but here in Rio,

114
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:13,130
I like it when all parties know what they're up against.

115
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,670
That's funny.

116
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,300
Because it goes both ways.

117
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,140
You know,

118
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,810
I hear your sister is very beautiful.

119
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,690
Wherever she hides

120
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,360
I Will find her.

121
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,170
The American fugitives killed

122
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,160
three DEA agents during a train robbery...

123
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,160
...Police warn they are armed and extremely dangerous.

124
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,670
Anyone with information should contact law enforcement immediately...

125
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,010
Mia?

126
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,020
You okay?

127
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,020
Yeah, you all right?

128
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:03,780
Just like a Toretto.

129
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,830
Where's Vince?

130
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:08,750
That's a good question.

131
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,790
He'll be here.

132
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,000
Guys, we're all over the news.

133
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,390
They're blaming us for the

134
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:16,460
killing of those DEA agents on the train.

135
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,590
Which means we just jumped to the top of the wanted list.

136
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:22,220
The feds have got to show everyone their agents are off limits

137
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,200
and they're going to send their best guys.

138
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,100
We got to get out of here.

139
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:28,430
One thing we know for sure

140
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:31,520
is that they wanted this car.

141
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,440
Because something is in it.

142
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,190
If we find out what it is, we'll know what we're up against.

143
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,430
All right, listen up!

144
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,340
The men we're after are professional runners.

145
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,080
They like speed and are guaranteed to go down the hardest possible way

146
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,020
so make sure you got your funderwear on.

147
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,680
We find them, we take them as a team, and we bring them back.

148
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,270
And above all else, we don't ever, ever let them get into cars.

149
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,940
Crime scene is 10 hours old and counting, men. Let's go hunting.

150
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,190
Agente Hobbs! Chief of Police, Jono Alemeida.

151
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,440
Luke.

152
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,740
Sorry to hear about the loss of your men.

153
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,860
Is all this really necessary to apprehend two men?

154
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,490
Let me tell you something about these two men.

155
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,790
One is a former federal officer,

156
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,080
been in deep cover for five years.

157
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,000
He knows every way you're going to come for him.

158
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,170
The other one is a professional criminal, escaped prison twice,

159
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,790
spent half his life on the run avoiding folks like you.

160
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,710
Well, if there's anything we can do to help the DSS...

161
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,840
Two things. One, I need a translator.

162
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,420
We have plenty in the public relations department.

163
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,300
Elena Neves.

164
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,260
- A patrol officer? - You heard me.

165
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,220
But why? We have many more experienced people.

166
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:54,310
I like her smile.

167
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,310
What's the second thing?

168
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,270
Stay the fuck out of my way.

169
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,160
Brian. Hm?

170
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,040
I have something I have to tell you.

171
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,790
God damn.

172
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,670
What a mess!

173
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,130
Where you been, man?

174
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,760
You better check that tone.

175
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,680
And you just better answer the goddamn question.

176
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,260
Stop it! Both of you.

177
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:34,730
Where were you, Vince?

178
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,940
Guys all over the favelas asking about you.

179
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,650
Couldn't get out of there without leading them straight to you.

180
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,820
Had to wait them out.

181
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,610
That is such horseshit

182
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,780
That was your job, and those were your guys! Hey!

183
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,450
Hey! Enough, O'Conner!

184
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:50,320
If he said he didn't do it, he didn't do it.

185
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,490
Go walk it off.

186
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:10,180
Look, I would love to expand my operations into your countries

187
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,260
but, quite frankly, your business methods are too violent.

188
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:17,600
Let me tell you a true story.

189
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,110
Five hundred years ago, the Portuguese and the Spanish came here,

190
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:25,650
each trying to get the country from their natives.

191
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,380
The Spaniards arrived, guns blazing,

192
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,370
determined to prove who was boss.

193
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,000
The natives killed every single Spaniard.

194
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:43,840
Personally, I prefer the methods of the Portuguese.

195
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,090
They came bearing gifts.

196
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,470
Mirrors, scissors, trinkets.

197
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:54,010
Things that the natives couldn't get on their own,

198
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,600
but to continue receiving them,

199
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,350
they had to work for the Portuguese.

200
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,900
And that's why all Brazilians speak Portuguese today.

201
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:06,440
Now, if you dominate the people with violence,

202
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,730
they will eventually fight

203
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:10,780
back because they have nothing to lose.

204
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,490
And that's the key.

205
00:24:13,570 --> 00:24:17,370
I go into the favelas and give them something to lose.

206
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:22,420
Electricity, running water, school rooms for their kids.

207
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,880
And for that taste of a better life,

208
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,380
I own them.

209
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:32,590
Gentlemen.

210
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,430
I apologize for the interruption.

211
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:41,520
Senior Reyes, may I speak with you?

212
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,100
We've found them.

213
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,770
Pardon me, gentlemen.

214
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:04,920
Almost wish I didn't see that.

215
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,170
Almost.

216
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,300
Wait, Dom.

217
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,550
Mia was on that train.

218
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,260
My sister!

219
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:19,510
I didn't know. I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.

220
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,930
You set up the deal!

221
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,640
I thought the job was for the cars.

222
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,860
I didn't know.

223
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,400
All they want is the chip.

224
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,110
Damn!

225
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,400
You should've come clean.

226
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,070
What's going on out here?

227
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,160
Nothing.

228
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,700
Please, Dom, just let me have the chip. I can take this to them.

229
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:43,960
They'll give it to Reyes and set things right.

230
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,040
Get out.

231
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:50,920
What?

232
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,050
Get out!

233
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,220
You never listen to me.

234
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,880
Not when I told you he was a cop,

235
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,980
and not now.

236
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,150
You never trust me and

237
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,770
look where it's gotten us.

238
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:13,150
Look at our family now.

239
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,710
I can't go home!

240
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:18,280
Your sister is stuck in this life!

241
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,330
Where's Letty, Dom?

242
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,330


243
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,830
Where's Letty?

244
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,770
Plasma cutter.

245
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:53,110
Wilkes, I want a list of every place within 50 miles

246
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:54,940
that distributes compressed gas tanks.

247
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,150
Pass me that manifest.

248
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:05,830
Officer Neves. Been waiting for you.

249
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,290
- You asked for me? - I did.

250
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,040
May I ask why?

251
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,540
My smile is not that great.

252
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,680
Your husband was an officer who was gunned down in the favela.

253
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,640
Six months later, you upped and joined the force.

254
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,970
You're motivated.

255
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,810
Plus, I figure you're the only one in Rio who cannot be bought.

256
00:27:25,890 --> 00:27:27,310
Am I right?

257
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,730
- Yes. - Of course I am.

258
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:31,980
Good news, bad news.

259
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,730
You know I like my dessert first.

260
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,780
Back-checked the rail line like you asked.

261
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860
Found a couple of spots where they unloaded the cars.

262
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,650
One set of tracks headed west

263
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,410
until it hit the main highway, then disappeared.

264
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,780
But another set of tracks headed east.

265
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,240
A 107-inch wheelbase, eight-and-a-half-inch tread.

266
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,910
The GT40 that was missing from the manifest.

267
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,580
Followed the trail a couple of miles.

268
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,880
Pretty easy in this scrub.

269
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,710
Can't move without leaving a sign.

270
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,250
Give me the damn veggies.

271
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,630
The ground rolls into a hardpack and we lost that track, too.

272
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,470
Not necessarily.

273
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,970
That road heads up through the hills into the favelas.

274
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,390
Couple of years ago, it was washed out by a storm.

275
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:09,850
It's all dirt a mile from where you were.

276
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,100
If they headed that way, we'll pick up their tracks there.

277
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:15,440
You come prepared.

278
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,980
I'm motivated.

279
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,740
All right, then.

280
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,530
Let's find ourselves a car.

281
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,190
What do you think?

282
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,690
Well, it's definitely a custom chip.

283
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:59,400
Look at all these side menus here for data entry.

284
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:01,320
Let's check this one.

285
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:09,950
Look at that. Same building, same order every week.

286
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,870
It's a delivery schedule.

287
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
What's this?

288
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,440
Drugs?

289
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,440
No. That's a dealer pack.

290
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,440
See, most major players, they weigh their money

291
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,400
so they don't have to constantly count it.

292
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,820
Right there, that's 49 kilos.

293
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,870
49 kilos is a million in twenties.

294
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,030
You're saying each one of these shipments is worth 10 million dollars?

295
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,060
I thought so.

296
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,110
So what is that?

297
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,820
A 100-million plus in cash houses?

298
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,780
That's how he keeps it off the grid.

299
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:28,530
I think it's safe to say that Reyes

300
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:29,910
is smart to want this back.

301
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:32,740
It's his whole network right there, just laid out on a chip.

302
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,830
Wilkes, Fusco, up the middle.

303
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:59,100
Mac, Chato, flank north.

304
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,110
What about me?

305
00:31:01,190 --> 00:31:02,190
Stay here.

306
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:13,490
Go that way!

307
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,950
The other two went over the wall!

308
00:31:58,330 --> 00:31:59,410
Come on, go! Go!

309
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,350
Get on the ground.

310
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,440
I got Toretto. Four blocks north of your...

311
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,730
They already know who you are.

312
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,140
Let's go.

313
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,020
You okay here?

314
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:33,780
Yeah. I'm good. Thank you.

315
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,310
They're going to be looking for the three of us together now.

316
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,110
We need to split up.

317
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:17,030
You and Mia head south, I'll lead them away.

318
00:35:17,110 --> 00:35:18,110
No.

319
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,490
Dom is right.

320
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,280
Look how lucky we just got. What happens next time?

321
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,410
We have no choice but to split up.

322
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,740
I'm pregnant.

323
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,080
I already lost my family once.

324
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:35,710
I'm not going through that again.

325
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,380
- Are you kidding me? - No.

326
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,270
I'm not going anywhere. Okay?

327
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,730
Dom?

328
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,770
Promise me we stick together.

329
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,410
I promise.

330
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,460
Our family just got bigger.

331
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,310
Something doesn't add up.

332
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,250
Toretto and O'Conner. They stay when they're supposed to run,

333
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,360
they steal gas then give it away?

334
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,070
Now they're killing federal agents?

335
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,860
It doesn't make any sense.

336
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,740
Here's what makes sense.

337
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:49,000
All these guys are is names on a list.

338
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,500
They come up, we take them down.

339
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,080
Not a phone call more, not a bullet less.

340
00:36:53,170 --> 00:36:54,880
Wilkes, we get anything?

341
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,630
Standard forensics.

342
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:58,500
Shoe prints. Hair and fiber.

343
00:36:58,590 --> 00:36:59,710
Prints are all over the car.

344
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,880
Anything else?

345
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:03,260
Yeah, we tracked the owner off the vehicle ID.

346
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,310
There are a couple of shell companies in between,

347
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:07,440
but we finally traced it back to

348
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,100
a corporation owned by an investor down here named Hernan Reyes.

349
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,180
Investor?

350
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:15,650
If there is anything illegal happening in Rio, Reyes is involved.

351
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:17,360
Okay, then so are we.

352
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,830
If he could get us any closer to our guys,

353
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:19,650
I want everything on him.

354
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:21,070
Chato, you're on the roof.

355
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:23,450
I want you on overwatch in case somebody comes back for something.

356
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,910
Mac, give me a cross-check on Reyes, full specs.

357
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:26,760
If he goes to the john,

358
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,200
I want to know how many times he shakes it.

359
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,320
You got it, boss.

360
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,660
Wilkes, Fusco!

361
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:33,250
Let's put all this mess back together.

362
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,290
That's going to take a while.

363
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,630
Then you better get started.

364
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,630
They were taking this car apart for a reason.

365
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,510
Let's put it back together and find out what's missing.

366
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,540
Hey, Dom, what do you remember about your father?

367
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,710
My father.

368
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,130
He used to...

369
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:28,180
He used to have a barbecue every Sunday after church.

370
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,220
For anybody in the neighborhood.

371
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,520
If you didn't go to church, you didn't get any barbecue.

372
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:39,730
Every single day he was in the shop,

373
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:42,990
and every single night, he was at the kitchen table with Mia,

374
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,240
helping her with her homework.

375
00:38:46,650 --> 00:38:52,410
Even after she went to sleep, he'd stay up for a few more hours

376
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:56,460
so he could learn the next chapter and help her the next day.

377
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,420
I remember everything about my father.

378
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,290
Everything.

379
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,760
That's just it.

380
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:06,630
I don't remember shit about my dad.

381
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,800
I don't remember him yelling.

382
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:13,350
I don't remember him smiling.

383
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,070
To be honest with you,

384
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:17,940
I don't even remember what the hell he looked like.

385
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,230
I don't remember. He just...

386
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,440
He was just never there.

387
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,780
You ain't going to be like that, Brian.

388
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,550
We can't keep running, Dom.

389
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,840
We got to get out.

390
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:53,850
We got to get out now.

391
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,390
You're right.

392
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:09,650
Here's how we're going to do it.

393
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,080
We're going to use this.

394
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,080
We're going do one last job.

395
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:20,870
We're going to take all of Reyes' money.

396
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,750
Every dime of it,

397
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,340
and disappear.

398
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,970
Forever.

399
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,680
New passports.

400
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,180
New lives with no more looking over our shoulder.

401
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,930
And we're just going to buy our freedom.

402
00:40:37,010 --> 00:40:38,060
That's right.

403
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,810
You realize

404
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:41,140
we're talking about going up against the most powerful guy in all of Rio?

405
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,900
Yes, we are.

406
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:46,230
Then we're going to need a team.

407
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,200
Let's run through the bases real quick. Who do we got?

408
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,660
First we're going to need a chameleon.

409
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,040
Someone who can blend in anywhere.

410
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,080
What else?

411
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,210
A fast talker.

412
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,630
Someone who can bullshit their way out of anything.

413
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,050
I got that.

414
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,470
This guy is going to have a lot of surveillance.

415
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,260
We're going to need someone who is good with circuits.

416
00:41:17,430 --> 00:41:18,680
And with those circuits,

417
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,970
Reyes is going to have wells.

418
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,430
We're going to need guys to punch through those walls.

419
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,440
What else?

420
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,730
Utilities and weapons.

421
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,570
Someone who ain't afraid to throw down.

422
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,490
Someone to back up every position.

423
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:35,110
Yeah, what else do we need?

424
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,820
Most importantly,

425
00:41:37,910 --> 00:41:40,120
we're going to need two precision drivers.

426
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,830
Guys that don't crack under pressure.

427
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:44,370
Guys that never lose.

428
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,960
You know we got that.

429
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,860
Aw, hell, no!

430
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,530
I see they really scraped the bottom of the barrel, huh?

431
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,910
I guess they did, since your ass is here.

432
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,710
When are you going to give Martin Luther King his car back?

433
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,710


434
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:30,540
As soon as you give Rick James his jacket back.

435
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,540


436
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,930
What's up, man?

437
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:51,110
Sexy legs, baby girl.

438
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:52,400
What time do they open?

439
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,070
They open the same time as I pull this trigger.

440
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:59,070
Want me to open them?

441
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:05,330
I told you the skinny chick had balls.

442
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:07,960
Looks like she started the party without us.

443
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:11,170
Hey, anybody can talk shit in Spanish, homie.

444
00:43:11,750 --> 00:43:14,090
What's this guy saying?

445
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,720
Ugly is still ugly in Spanish or in English.

446
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,100
- Who are these clowns, man? - Circus clowns.

447
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,230
I thought cockfights were illegal in Brazil.

448
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:29,400
I see you all have met.

449
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,190
You know when you called me to come to Rio

450
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:36,110
I assumed it would be for something more exciting than this.

451
00:43:36,190 --> 00:43:37,190
Look at this guy.

452
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,410
- Long time. - I missed you, man.

453
00:43:39,490 --> 00:43:40,570
Good to see you.

454
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,570
Brother. What's up?

455
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:44,740
Yo, check this out. This is Tej.

456
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,750
Best circuit man on the East Coast.

457
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:48,330
And this is my boy, Roman Pearce.

458
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:50,920
We go way back, I met this guy in juvie.

459
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,630
I pulled that job with him in Miami.

460
00:43:52,710 --> 00:43:54,130
I've heard about you.

461
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,800
Nice digs.

462
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,670
Yeah, well, the Ritz was sold out.

463
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,970
So what's this all about, Dom?

464
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:04,390
Yeah, man, why did you drag us halfway around the world?

465
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:06,270
Because we got a job.

466
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,890
All right, so our target's name is Hernan Reyes.

467
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,690
And he runs the drug scene down here.

468
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,320
He's never been busted because he doesn't leave a paper trail.

469
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,440
No paper trail means no banks.

470
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,610
And no banks means cash houses.

471
00:44:18,690 --> 00:44:21,110
That's right. Ten of them, to be exact.

472
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,370
Spread throughout the city.

473
00:44:23,450 --> 00:44:25,280
And we're going to hit them all.

474
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:27,750
All of them?

475
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,250
All of them.

476
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:31,250
That sounds crazy.

477
00:44:31,330 --> 00:44:33,290
You bring us to a whole other country

478
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:35,420
so we can rob the dude who runs it?

479
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,170
I thought this was business.

480
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,760
Sounds personal to me.

481
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:42,300
Is that what this is?

482
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,760
I got love for y'all,

483
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:46,180
but personal ain't good business.

484
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,060
I can't do this, homie.

485
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:55,440
So what we're talking about is $100 million.

486
00:44:55,610 --> 00:44:57,570
You say what?

487
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,280
Hundred... See, sometimes I be over thinking, man,

488
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,410
and I know we just met, but you just, kind of, got to...

489
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:08,240
That's right, $100 million, and everything we take,

490
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:09,750
we split even.

491
00:45:09,830 --> 00:45:11,620
That's a little over $11 million apiece.

492
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,000
I am down.

493
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,500
I'm in.

494
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,550
Eleven million.

495
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,670
Sounds like a whole lot of vaginal activity to me.

496
00:45:22,130 --> 00:45:24,430
You can't pull off 10 heists on the same mark.

497
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:25,590
You just can't.

498
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,220
As soon as we hit the first one,

499
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,060
they're going to do everything they can to protect the rest.

500
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,810
Exactly.

501
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:12,520
Nobody move!

502
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:28,910
That's all of it.

503
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:30,200
You a dead man.

504
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:31,370
You're all dead men!

505
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:33,700
You don't have a place to hide.

506
00:46:36,670 --> 00:46:37,710
Who's hiding?

507
00:46:37,790 --> 00:46:39,080
Are you crazy?

508
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:40,380
Are you crazy?

509
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,040
Do you know whose house this is?

510
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,340
Whose money are you stealing?

511
00:46:53,810 --> 00:46:55,230
We ain't stealing it.

512
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:07,240
You tell your boss exactly who did this.

513
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:10,370
Tell him there's more coming.

514
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,040
Voila.

515
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,000
Turn it over.

516
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:28,380
She's running on all eight. Checks out fine.

517
00:47:30,930 --> 00:47:32,850
Keep looking.

518
00:47:34,890 --> 00:47:38,440
Boss, if something was missing, we'd know.

519
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:07,710
It's a goddamn shame putting bullshit like that on a classic.

520
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,130
You may as well slap neon lights on it.

521
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,400
They took the chip.

522
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,360
We got a hit on the police scanner.

523
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,230
Armed robbery at a house in Leblon.

524
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:28,740
Address cross-checks against property

525
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:30,490
owned by one of Hernan Reyes' corporations.

526
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:31,740
All right, if that's our guys

527
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:34,410
then whatever was on that chip led them directly to that house.

528
00:48:34,490 --> 00:48:35,660
It's them, for sure.

529
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,080
How do you know that?

530
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:41,460
Because no one else in Rio is stupid enough to rob Reyes.

531
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,260
Explain.

532
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,020
They invaded the Leblon house.

533
00:48:58,390 --> 00:48:59,730
Who invaded?

534
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:02,190
The men from the train.

535
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,740
How much did they take?

536
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,700
They didn't take anything.

537
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:18,410
They burned it!

538
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:20,290
They burned my money?

539
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:23,500
Yes. And said there's more coming.

540
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:32,590
Okay...

541
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:43,230
Then this...

542
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:46,560
...is what we're going to do.

543
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:54,740
Clean the houses.

544
00:49:55,030 --> 00:49:59,240
I want that money under lock and key...

545
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,790
...within an hour.

546
00:50:01,870 --> 00:50:04,080
Understand?

547
00:50:06,290 --> 00:50:07,920
Understood.

548
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,310
Number One is on the move, man.

549
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:45,250
Two is on the move.

550
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:10,980
I got mine.

551
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,000
I got eyes on Five.

552
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:04,030
I know y'all said they were consolidating the money somewhere, but,

553
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:07,250
y'all ain't going to believe this.

554
00:52:04,450 --> 00:52:07,250


555
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,420
Well, this job just got a lot harder.

556
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:21,930
If he's moving it into a police station

557
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:24,470
he's got some serious brass in his pocket.

558
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,140
Looks like this is going to be a shorter trip than I thought...

559
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:28,430
Hell, yeah, we can't do this.

560
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:32,020
"Can't"'? You mean, "Shouldn't."

561
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,070
I think this doesn't change a thing.

562
00:52:38,150 --> 00:52:40,490
I say we stick to the plan.

563
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,240
You say what?

564
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,990
This just went from Mission: Impossible

565
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:45,950
to Mission: In-freaking-sanity.

566
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:49,410
Whatever, man.

567
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,490
I ain't scared, I'm just letting you all know,

568
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:52,870
going in that building is crazy.

569
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,380
I got this.

570
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,340
What time was the robbery?

571
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:01,260
11:00.

572
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,010
Here we go.

573
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:07,680
Enhance it.

574
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:11,230
Their faces are covered.

575
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,440
Run it through FRS.

576
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:20,150
Well, hello, you son of a bitch.

577
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:23,710
Wilkes!

578
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:26,070
Run the photos of known associates of Toretto and O'Conner

579
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,040
against customs entries into Brazil in the last two weeks.

580
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,320
Check planes, trains, boats,

581
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:32,290
everything short of the goddamn space shuttle.

582
00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:41,720
They can change their names but they can't change their faces.

583
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,550
Something big is going down.

584
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,720
That's a 1970 Charger.

585
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,890
Fusco! Upload these specs into the database.

586
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:51,270
Have the computer cross-check it with overhead satellites

587
00:53:51,350 --> 00:53:53,350
every 15 minutes, the van behind it, too.

588
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:55,230
If these vehicles move in the streets of Rio,

589
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:56,190
I want to know about it.

590
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,070
Everything okay?

591
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,200
Everything is okay.

592
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,950
Who is this Hobbs? This Federal Agent running around town?

593
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,200
Some American cowboy.

594
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:12,950
He's handled.

595
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,660
He killed sixteen of our men.

596
00:54:15,370 --> 00:54:16,580
Handle him better.

597
00:54:16,750 --> 00:54:22,050
Look... He requested a rookie patrol officer as his assistant.

598
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:25,800
They won't be a problem.

599
00:54:54,790 --> 00:54:56,710
- It's all here?- Yes.

600
00:54:58,210 --> 00:54:59,960
What about Toretto and O'Conner? Where are they?

601
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,420
Nothing yet.

602
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,300
But I have all our officers searching.

603
00:55:05,130 --> 00:55:06,260
Not good enough.

604
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:08,550
Put a price on their heads.

605
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,140
High enough...

606
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,850
...to get every pair of eyes in the city searching for them.

607
00:55:20,310 --> 00:55:22,820
The beauty of public offices?

608
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:26,740
Public records.

609
00:55:27,150 --> 00:55:28,470
This is where he's keeping the money.

610
00:55:28,470 --> 00:55:29,570
The vault in the evidence room.

611
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:33,450
Um. Uh, yeah. Can I get everyone's attention,

612
00:55:33,450 --> 00:55:35,000
right here, for a second?

613
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:38,750
We're talking about breaking into a police station.

614
00:55:38,830 --> 00:55:40,540
Is anyone listening to those words?

615
00:55:40,630 --> 00:55:42,170
Anybody? Popo?

616
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,840
Five-O. One-time. Pigs.

617
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:46,210
People we don't like.

618
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,220
You know, police stations are designed to keep people in, not out.

619
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,590
That's why it's a stealth mission.

620
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:53,720
We'll be in and out before they even know we were there.

621
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:55,350
Well, we'll need to get eyes in there.

622
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:57,890
At least to find out the make and model of that vault.

623
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,480
So the vault and then, so...

624
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,020
it's crazy.

625
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:05,940
Who's supposed to do all this?

626
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,290
What do you mean?

627
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:18,540
Why me?

628
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:20,540
Because you got the biggest mouth.

629
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,630
That's for damn sure.

630
00:56:32,140 --> 00:56:33,720
Hello, beautiful.

631
00:56:33,800 --> 00:56:36,430
Look at those dimples. Sexy, sexy.

632
00:56:36,510 --> 00:56:38,560
Love those glasses. Where did you get them from?

633
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,060
Are those like Gucci frames or something?

634
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:42,310
No English?

635
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,190
No, no, no. Damn.

636
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:46,820
How are you, sir?

637
00:56:47,230 --> 00:56:51,070
Special Agent O'Conner. US Federal Bureau of Investigation.

638
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,360
It says Caucasian.

639
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,410
That's a tan. You know, a tan?

640
00:56:58,330 --> 00:56:59,660
Look, I'm working this

641
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:02,370
case and I got some evidence here to be held.

642
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,830
But I need to get in and check your storage facility first.

643
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:05,920
Nope.

644
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:07,910
Look, I know you're a true professional,

645
00:57:07,910 --> 00:57:09,300
and I respect you, I promise.

646
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:11,550
You know, it looks like you work out a little bit, too.

647
00:57:11,630 --> 00:57:14,090
What do you bench, about 350?

648
00:57:14,510 --> 00:57:15,510
Ah, Shit.

649
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,010
Look, I'm just trying to do my job, man.

650
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:20,980
My boss sent me here to just make sure that everything was safe.

651
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:22,060
It will be safe.

652
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,230
Let me just come in and take a quick peek.

653
00:57:24,310 --> 00:57:25,310
Nope.

654
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,940
Come on, man. Hook a brother up, please?

655
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:29,650
Nope. And you're not my brother.

656
00:57:29,730 --> 00:57:30,990
Brother from another mother?

657
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:33,210
Look!

658
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:34,280
No one enters the facility but authorized evidence personnel.

659
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:35,570
Now stop wasting my time.

660
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,620
I'm going to call the embassy.

661
00:57:36,700 --> 00:57:38,160
No,no,no! No, we're good.

662
00:57:38,490 --> 00:57:40,620
We don't need to call them. For what? We're good.

663
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:43,290
Here, I got the box. We're all good.

664
00:57:43,370 --> 00:57:46,290
I promise you. Thank you so much for your time.

665
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:48,590
Swear to God, if you were on the other side of that glass

666
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:51,050
I'd bust your damn face in. Now translate that.

667
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:10,210
It's done. See, I think I

668
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:12,610
make a better special agent than you ever did.

669
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:16,660
Well, that depends on how you define "Special."

670
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:20,990
Come on, now. Let's see what we got.

671
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,580
Not funny.

672
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,630
All right, come on.

673
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,180
Dawg, you still can't drive.

674
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:42,810
Now, I see why you're always getting into accidents.

675
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:45,100
You can't even drive a damn remote control car.

676
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:47,100
I'm going to need you to shut up right now.

677
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,310
- I'm not going to shut up. - Shut up.

678
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:50,770
Strap him in his safety belt, man.

679
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,530
Give me the remote, dawg. Go left.

680
00:58:55,610 --> 00:58:56,350
It looks like something

681
00:58:56,350 --> 00:58:57,740
right over there to the left. What is that?

682
00:58:57,820 --> 00:58:58,820
What is that?

683
00:59:00,200 --> 00:59:01,200
Bingo.

684
00:59:02,450 --> 00:59:04,450
What is that, six-by-six?

685
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:05,620
Eight-by-twelve.

686
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,210
Seven-by-twelve.

687
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:10,420
Fitted with 18-inch-thick steel reinforced walls

688
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:14,050
with a insulated copper core to protect against thermal lance.

689
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:17,590
A Class-3 electronic lock with a surefire Griffin retumbler

690
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,390
and a biometric palm scanner.

691
00:59:19,470 --> 00:59:21,970
Ten tons of top-of-the-line security.

692
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,720
Do I want to know how you know all that?

693
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:25,810
I had a life before you knew me, O'Conner.

694
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,730
Let's just leave it at that, all right?

695
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:29,480
She is a beauty, though, man.

696
00:59:29,560 --> 00:59:31,730
A "Beauty" As in "Good"?

697
00:59:31,810 --> 00:59:34,570
"Beauty" As in, she's going to start off playing hard to get.

698
00:59:34,650 --> 00:59:37,030
Then, no matter how much I caress her,

699
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:38,910
no matter how much I love her,

700
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:42,240
in the end, she still ain't going to give up that ass.

701
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:50,330
Two to one says you blow the wrong pipe.

702
00:59:50,710 --> 00:59:52,750
Yo, why you got to be so negative all the time, man?

703
00:59:53,960 --> 00:59:55,300
I ain't negative.

704
00:59:55,380 --> 00:59:58,170
I'm just positive you're going to mess it up.

705
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:01,550
I'm telling you, man, you got issues.

706
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,560
You need to learn to relax, loco.

707
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:37,260
You better hurry up, we got less than a minute.

708
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:43,300
Why do you always set the timer so short?

709
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:07,990
I hope you know where you're going.

710
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,910
I got this. Relax, man.

711
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:12,920
Relax.

712
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:26,760
...A police station.

713
01:01:27,140 --> 01:01:28,560
Relax.

714
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:42,200
You used too much explosive! Again.

715
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:44,950
Too much, too little...

716
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:46,530
it's all the same.

717
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:48,850
That's some Buddha shit you

718
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:52,040
learned from a book in the prison library, isn't it?

719
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,750
And what you're doing there on the wall...

720
01:01:54,830 --> 01:01:57,630
You got that from the same book, huh?

721
01:01:58,130 --> 01:01:59,130
You're so negative, bro.

722
01:02:25,990 --> 01:02:28,320
Can I have some light?

723
01:02:31,740 --> 01:02:34,120
Got it. We got it!

724
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:35,830
Yeah, we're looking at four cameras.

725
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:39,500
Yo, that's some high-end shit, too. Marker optics.

726
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:43,670
Hundred-degree field-of-view. Ten seconds oscillation.

727
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,760
Yeah, that's a narrow window, man.

728
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,510
Can't we just tap in and replace the image?

729
01:02:47,590 --> 01:02:49,600
No, it's hooked into a digital sync.

730
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:51,680
They would know we were in the system.

731
01:02:51,760 --> 01:02:53,810
The best we can do is peek.

732
01:02:53,890 --> 01:02:56,480
We're going to need some real fast cars to get through this.

733
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,020
Not just fast.

734
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:00,520
You got a hard right and a hairpin.

735
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,280
We're going to need something agile.

736
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:04,110
You guys mock up a track.

737
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:05,190
O'Conner.

738
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:07,950
Let's go get some cars.

739
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:09,870
Nice.

740
01:03:48,740 --> 01:03:51,070
Home sweet home.

741
01:04:09,010 --> 01:04:10,130
Or that.

742
01:04:11,010 --> 01:04:13,510
How about that? All motor, no tuning issues.

743
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,930
I always wanted one of those.

744
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:19,600
Held the record on the Avenida three years running.

745
01:04:21,020 --> 01:04:22,100
Damn, bro...

746
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:24,820
You got a lot of balls to bring your problems here, Toretto.

747
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:28,070
Not to mention a cop.

748
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:30,360
Yeah, we can keep that on the low.

749
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:33,410
Word on the street is a lot of people are looking for you two.

750
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,370
What?

751
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:37,410
You didn't think we'd recognize you?

752
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:40,790
No, we're kind of counting on it.

753
01:04:41,210 --> 01:04:43,540
That little coupe may run the streets around here,

754
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:49,090
but that monster has never seen a set of tail lights.

755
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,130
Even Well, she's about to.

756
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,350
Dominic Toretto's ride in my garage.

757
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:59,600
Now that... will be a nice trophy.

758
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,940
Let's go, legend.

759
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:07,400
Car for car.

760
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,320
Car for car?

761
01:05:09,690 --> 01:05:11,200
You want it, come and get it.

762
01:05:15,910 --> 01:05:17,740
Let's see what they got.

763
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,380
Really?

764
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:30,260
Where did you get that from? Papa Smurf?

765
01:05:30,340 --> 01:05:33,260
Okay, O'Conner, give it your best shot.

766
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,330
How was that one?

767
01:05:57,410 --> 01:05:58,410
Camera caught you.

768
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:00,950
- What? - Yeah, it still caught you.

769
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,000
Man, I was milking the hell out of that thing, too.

770
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:05,500
We're going to need a faster car.

771
01:06:10,090 --> 01:06:11,840
I want my money. Come on, man.

772
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:21,060
Let's get it! Watch this.

773
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:31,280
That's exactly why your ass ain't been driving.

774
01:06:42,830 --> 01:06:44,500
I think I'm in love.

775
01:06:48,290 --> 01:06:49,790
That was real solid work.

776
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,340
I think Camera 3 still caught you, though.

777
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:54,630
Let's do it again.

778
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:04,100
That's the piggy bank you ordered.

779
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,100
You're kidding me. Yep.

780
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:10,770
Where in the hell did y'all get one of these?

781
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:13,280
Well, we had a life before you met us.

782
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:17,950
All right, I'll get to work on the electronic tumbler

783
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:20,200
but there's still another problem.

784
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,200
Palm scanner.

785
01:07:22,280 --> 01:07:24,080
And without Reyes' handprint,

786
01:07:24,410 --> 01:07:26,540
Houdini himself couldn't open this bitch.

787
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:28,620
How do you know it's Reyes' handprint?

788
01:07:28,710 --> 01:07:30,460
You got $100 million in a safe.

789
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:32,250
You going to put somebody else's handprint on it?

790
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:36,760
That shit is eating you alive.

791
01:07:36,840 --> 01:07:38,090
You check that.

792
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:40,220
- Yo, check that. - Shut up!

793
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:42,390
How are we supposed to get Reyes' handprint?

794
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:45,220
Han.

795
01:07:45,310 --> 01:07:46,310
You're up.

796
01:07:48,310 --> 01:07:51,150
Sure. Nothing like the easy stuff.

797
01:07:51,980 --> 01:07:53,730
Let's go. I'll drive.

798
01:08:12,170 --> 01:08:14,170
- I make six bodyguards. - Seven.

799
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:18,130
You think that guy with a fanny pack is a tourist?

800
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:25,640
So, how long were you in the army?

801
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:28,520
That gun you pulled the other day was a Jericho 941.

802
01:08:29,850 --> 01:08:31,600
Thumb-racking the slide?

803
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:33,520
That was straight-up Mossad.

804
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,650
I got out of the military

805
01:08:37,860 --> 01:08:40,820
probably the same time you quit smoking.

806
01:08:40,910 --> 01:08:42,870
The amount of chips you eat,

807
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,410
the way you always have to keep your hands and mouth busy,

808
01:08:46,490 --> 01:08:49,080
you were a two-pack-a-day man for sure.

809
01:08:51,170 --> 01:08:52,790
Unfiltered.

810
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:57,880
Well, this is a bust.

811
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:02,430
We're not going to be able to get his fingerprints out here.

812
01:09:02,510 --> 01:09:05,550
We need to do some more recon, call in a couple of extra guys.

813
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,890
Or

814
01:09:07,310 --> 01:09:09,520
you don't send a man to do a woman's job.

815
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:10,540
We're going to figure this out, I promise you.

816
01:10:13,830 --> 01:10:15,120
What's up?

817
01:10:15,750 --> 01:10:18,290
I thought you were more of a thong man.

818
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:19,710
We got the print.

819
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:22,590
Where?

820
01:10:24,590 --> 01:10:26,550
Okay, that's crazy.

821
01:10:28,260 --> 01:10:32,770
So, did he just slap that ass or did he grab and hold on to it?

822
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,400
Hey, this will work.

823
01:10:38,020 --> 01:10:39,270
I'm impressed.

824
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,360
- Got it? - Got it.

825
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:43,150
But you still didn't answer the question.

826
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:51,580
Oh, no. Guys, guys! Guys, we have a problem.

827
01:10:51,660 --> 01:10:53,910
The whole team just got burnt.

828
01:10:55,330 --> 01:10:57,170
Now we're all wanted.

829
01:10:59,340 --> 01:11:00,340
How did this happen?

830
01:11:00,500 --> 01:11:04,090
US Diplomatic Security Service issued the warrants.

831
01:11:04,170 --> 01:11:06,010
Agent L. Hobbs.

832
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:07,380
Hold on one second.

833
01:11:08,510 --> 01:11:09,550
Hey, Dom.

834
01:11:11,220 --> 01:11:13,020
Is that the guy you saw in the favela?

835
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:16,980
Yeah.

836
01:11:17,350 --> 01:11:20,810
Hobbs is the leader of the elite task force for the DSS.

837
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,020
So he's good.

838
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:25,190
When the FBI wants to find somebody, that's who they call.

839
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:27,030
Because he never misses his mark.

840
01:11:27,110 --> 01:11:29,990
This guy is Old Testament.

841
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,370
Blood, bullets, wrath of God. That's his style.

842
01:11:33,740 --> 01:11:36,160
And right now he's hunting us?

843
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,960
Dom, we got to move up our timeline.

844
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:39,170
Yeah, but how?

845
01:11:39,250 --> 01:11:40,540
This thing's already been

846
01:11:40,540 --> 01:11:42,710
difficult without Wyatt Earp on our asses.

847
01:11:43,300 --> 01:11:45,050
If anything, we need more room to breathe.

848
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:48,760
Roman's right.

849
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:54,060
Think we need to get some fresh air.

850
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,060
We've got a hit. '70s Charger.

851
01:12:00,150 --> 01:12:02,150
Let's get a move on!

852
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:08,150
Eastbound on Avenida Atlantica.

853
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:09,660
Move, move, move, move!

854
01:12:15,910 --> 01:12:17,580
It stopped about a block ahead.

855
01:12:18,250 --> 01:12:19,670
Park it. We're going on foot.

856
01:12:42,980 --> 01:12:44,110
Hey, Toretto.

857
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,820
You're under arrest.

858
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:55,280
Arrest?

859
01:12:56,450 --> 01:12:58,370
I don't feel like I'm under arrest.

860
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,370
How about you, Brian?

861
01:13:00,460 --> 01:13:01,620
No, not a bit.

862
01:13:03,580 --> 01:13:04,840
Not even a little bit.

863
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,170
Just give it a minute. It'll sink in.

864
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,050
We didn't kill those feds. That was Reyes.

865
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:14,430
I don't give a shit.

866
01:13:14,510 --> 01:13:17,310
I'm just here to bring in two assholes whose names hit my desk.

867
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,810
Yeah, that sounds like a real hero.

868
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:25,400
That's funny.

869
01:13:25,480 --> 01:13:26,950
From a guy who took the oath of a cop,

870
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,570
then went against everything it stood for.

871
01:13:28,650 --> 01:13:30,400
Or some wannabe tough guy prick

872
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:32,860
who beat a man half to death with a socket wrench.

873
01:13:33,610 --> 01:13:34,820
Yeah, real tough.

874
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:38,990
You turn around and put your hands behind your back.

875
01:13:40,160 --> 01:13:41,580
I don't think so.

876
01:13:41,660 --> 01:13:44,290
Your mistake is thinking you got a goddamn choice, boy.

877
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:50,050
And your mistake?

878
01:13:50,670 --> 01:13:52,170
Thinking you're in America.

879
01:13:55,340 --> 01:13:58,850
You're a long way from home.

880
01:14:01,350 --> 01:14:03,850
This is Brazil.

881
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,330
Come on, boss. Another day.

882
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,500
Come on, H, it's a lot of heat.

883
01:14:30,710 --> 01:14:33,050
I'll see you soon, Toretto.

884
01:14:34,380 --> 01:14:36,970
I look forward to it, cop.

885
01:15:14,260 --> 01:15:15,260
Yep.

886
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:16,720
Tracker's on.

887
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:19,090
Got them.

888
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,700
I don't understand. Why come here?

889
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:31,040
Why risk it all for $20 worth of silver?

890
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,880
Because it's worth it.

891
01:16:39,680 --> 01:16:41,220
You should run, you know.

892
01:16:41,970 --> 01:16:43,390
Hobbs will find you.

893
01:16:46,100 --> 01:16:49,020
You have every reason to leave. Why stay?

894
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,530
Why do you?

895
01:17:00,070 --> 01:17:02,070
My husband was a good police officer.

896
01:17:02,910 --> 01:17:04,530
An honest man.

897
01:17:05,950 --> 01:17:07,660
We both grew up here.

898
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,960
Two years ago he was murdered in the street

899
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:12,790
right outside our door.

900
01:17:15,290 --> 01:17:19,050
Reyes owns this favela now. He gives things to people.

901
01:17:21,380 --> 01:17:23,680
But everything has a price.

902
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:28,140
The people here need a new start.

903
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:30,230
They need to be free.

904
01:17:40,110 --> 01:17:41,740
You didn't kill those men in the train,

905
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:43,700
did you?

906
01:17:48,240 --> 01:17:51,040
Now, why would you believe anything I would tell you?

907
01:18:02,590 --> 01:18:04,300
Was she so special to you?

908
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:11,430
I never thought anyone could understand now much.

909
01:18:14,900 --> 01:18:16,270
But you do.

910
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:52,970
Close, but not enough.

911
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:55,100
Dom, the window is too small, man.

912
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:58,940
Only way we're going to beat the cameras is with invisible cars.

913
01:19:01,650 --> 01:19:04,030
And I know just where to get them.

914
01:19:07,160 --> 01:19:08,450
Let's take a ride, boys.

915
01:19:16,330 --> 01:19:18,380
Don't hurt yourself.

916
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:37,850
It's been a while since

917
01:19:37,850 --> 01:19:39,400
I've been behind the wheel of one of these.

918
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:41,610
First time I've ever been in the front seat.

919
01:19:49,360 --> 01:19:50,910
Rome, what took you so long?

920
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,630
I thought for sure you'd be

921
01:19:52,630 --> 01:19:55,120
showing up with some chrome spinners or something.

922
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,210
Real funny.

923
01:19:58,710 --> 01:19:59,990
I got $100,000 that says

924
01:19:59,990 --> 01:20:02,340
I can take you all in the next quarter-mile.

925
01:20:02,420 --> 01:20:03,960
Yeah, your broke ass has got a hundred grand.

926
01:20:04,050 --> 01:20:06,380
If we pull off this job, I will.

927
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:08,220
The next two lights.

928
01:20:08,510 --> 01:20:09,680
Hundred thousand.

929
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,430
We don't pull this job off, we're probably dead anyway.

930
01:20:13,970 --> 01:20:16,020
Let's make it a million.

931
01:20:16,890 --> 01:20:19,230
I like that. All right, a million-dollar quarter-mile.

932
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,020
All right, then.

933
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:24,860
You only live once. Let's do it.

934
01:20:25,360 --> 01:20:26,400
What do you say, Dom?

935
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,530
We talking or we racing?

936
01:20:29,990 --> 01:20:31,070
Just don't cheat this time.

937
01:20:31,700 --> 01:20:34,330
Got to let that go.

938
01:20:57,470 --> 01:20:58,560
Typical, Roman.

939
01:20:58,640 --> 01:21:01,100
I'm going to get this money. I'm hungry.

940
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,070
Don't make it too easy for me, boys.

941
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:14,910
No!

942
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:17,870
Not this time, Dom.

943
01:21:22,710 --> 01:21:24,460
You got to want it, Brian.

944
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:56,490
Yeah! Owned you! Owned you!

945
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,550
- Good race, O'Conner. - Thanks, Dom.

946
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:18,310
Do you know how long I've been waiting for that shit?

947
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,350
I told you he didn't see it.

948
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,270
Your man right there?

949
01:22:22,350 --> 01:22:24,770
He let off the throttle at the line.

950
01:22:24,850 --> 01:22:27,560
You didn't do nothing. He let you win.

951
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,230
Bullshit.

952
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:54,170
- Vince, what are you doing? - Quiet! They've been tracking you.

953
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:03,890
I know she's here!

954
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:07,560
Find her!

955
01:23:07,730 --> 01:23:09,270
Go!Go!Go!

956
01:23:23,660 --> 01:23:25,330
It's okay. Wait!

957
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:28,460
Reyes' guys were waiting for me at the market.

958
01:23:29,420 --> 01:23:31,040
Vince saved my life.

959
01:23:36,470 --> 01:23:37,930
You hungry?

960
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,520
- Yeah, sure. - Good.

961
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,480
Because you're saying grace.

962
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:51,110
Thanks, Vince.

963
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,320
Yo, you burned it!

964
01:23:59,410 --> 01:24:02,370
Yo, this is how my momma does it. Relax.

965
01:24:02,450 --> 01:24:04,790
Yeah, but your mom is the worst cook in the world.

966
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:07,750
Yo, don't you be talking about my momma.

967
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,420
Yeah, come on, baby. Who's good living?

968
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,630
To you, bro. Cheers, cheers, cheers.

969
01:24:14,710 --> 01:24:16,970
So, we in Brazil. It's the good life.

970
01:24:18,130 --> 01:24:21,930
So, you got a little more than $10 or $11 million coming.

971
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:23,140
What you going to do with your money?

972
01:24:23,220 --> 01:24:24,890
- Me? - Yeah.

973
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:25,850
Actually, man, I been

974
01:24:25,850 --> 01:24:27,730
thinking about opening up a garage back home.

975
01:24:28,690 --> 01:24:30,080
Place where people can bring their cars and

976
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,480
not get completely ripped off.

977
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:32,690
You know what I mean?

978
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,110
- Really? - Yeah.

979
01:24:34,190 --> 01:24:37,070
So, your dream is to start a day job?

980
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:39,320
That's stupid. Like, why would...

981
01:24:39,400 --> 01:24:41,990
No, it's not stupid at all. I love what I do.

982
01:24:42,070 --> 01:24:43,070
That don't make no sense to me.

983
01:24:43,160 --> 01:24:45,990
I know what I'm going to do with my money.

984
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,910
Buying some cooking lessons for my man.

985
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:51,880
See? See?

986
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:54,250
There you go with that negativity, man.

987
01:24:54,340 --> 01:24:56,380
You know me. Money ain't a goddamn thing.

988
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,010
It's going to take a little more than money to learn how to cook.

989
01:24:59,090 --> 01:25:00,340
That's horrible.

990
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:02,420
But I heard they was looking

991
01:25:02,420 --> 01:25:04,550
for a chef down at this animal shelter.

992
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,720
You might want to...

993
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:07,520
I know the manager.

994
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,610
Hey, Dom.

995
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:18,820
Listen.

996
01:25:19,570 --> 01:25:23,280
I know that you're all set for this job tomorrow,

997
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,120
but if you need an extra man, I could...

998
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,530
You're in.

999
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,500
There's always room for family.

1000
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:44,010
Thank you.

1001
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:49,720
Get something to eat.

1002
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:53,140
Yeah.

1003
01:25:55,020 --> 01:25:56,730
Can you believe Mia calls this a curse?

1004
01:26:00,530 --> 01:26:02,700
She might be right.

1005
01:26:07,030 --> 01:26:09,490
You really like doing that stuff, huh?

1006
01:26:09,740 --> 01:26:12,300
When your life is on the line

1007
01:26:12,300 --> 01:26:14,000
that's when you learn about yourself.

1008
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,710
That's a fair deal.

1009
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,530
We're less than 24 hours

1010
01:26:25,530 --> 01:26:28,140
from the biggest celebration of our life.

1011
01:26:28,220 --> 01:26:30,520
Y'all need a refill. This is serious stuff.

1012
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:31,890
- No, I'm good. - Cheers, baby.

1013
01:26:31,980 --> 01:26:33,600
I'm good. No, thank you.

1014
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:34,690
No, she can't.

1015
01:26:36,940 --> 01:26:38,940
What do you mean? She can't.

1016
01:26:39,270 --> 01:26:41,940
What do you mean she can't? What is...

1017
01:26:46,110 --> 01:26:48,370
Are you serious right now?

1018
01:26:48,450 --> 01:26:52,160
Is that the reason you let him beat you in the quarter-mile?

1019
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:56,750
- That was a baby gift. - No, that's messed up.

1020
01:26:56,830 --> 01:26:58,420
No, you're not taking that from me.

1021
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,130
Wait, wait, hold on a second.

1022
01:27:00,210 --> 01:27:04,510
So, did he just smack the ass or did he grab and hold on to it?

1023
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:05,880
Which One was it?

1024
01:27:05,970 --> 01:27:08,470
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1025
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:10,390
How can you keep this a secret?

1026
01:27:10,470 --> 01:27:12,470
Crazy, huh?  It's your boy.

1027
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,270
Baby gift, huh?

1028
01:27:18,520 --> 01:27:21,360
I have no idea what they're talking about.

1029
01:27:25,530 --> 01:27:27,570
Toast

1030
01:27:35,910 --> 01:27:39,170
Money will come and go. We know that.

1031
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:41,550
But the most important thing

1032
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,670
in life will always be the people in this room.

1033
01:27:45,090 --> 01:27:46,340
Right here.

1034
01:27:48,970 --> 01:27:50,010
Right now.

1035
01:28:04,610 --> 01:28:06,190
I'm all set.

1036
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:10,200
Yo, Santos. Van good?

1037
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:13,490
You know we're always good, bro.

1038
01:28:17,370 --> 01:28:20,120
Hobbs is on the other side of the city.

1039
01:28:20,210 --> 01:28:22,790
We're not going to get a better window.

1040
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:25,130
Okay, guys, it's show time!

1041
01:28:25,210 --> 01:28:26,800
First team in position, let's go.

1042
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,130
Come on, let's do this.

1043
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:41,440
Hey, Dom.

1044
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,400
I got eyes on Mia.

1045
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,490
Moscow, Bali, Goa, Hong Kong.

1046
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:54,990
And what do they all have in common?

1047
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:56,160
No extradition.

1048
01:28:58,250 --> 01:29:01,000
We're one hour away from the rest of our lives.

1049
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:05,090
Cops!

1050
01:29:07,670 --> 01:29:09,050
Come on. Go.

1051
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,270
You just made a big mistake.

1052
01:29:23,770 --> 01:29:25,690
Took me a while to find that tracking chip.

1053
01:29:26,190 --> 01:29:27,570
But not as long to flip the receiver.

1054
01:29:27,650 --> 01:29:29,150
You're going down, Toretto.

1055
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:31,280
I'm right here.

1056
01:30:59,410 --> 01:31:01,410
- Dom! Stand back. - I got this.

1057
01:31:07,330 --> 01:31:11,250
- Pull off! - Dom! Please, stop!

1058
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:17,890
Dom!

1059
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:28,400
Dom!

1060
01:32:33,340 --> 01:32:35,300
We're coming in now.

1061
01:32:36,880 --> 01:32:39,550
Have the marshals meet us at the airport when we land.

1062
01:32:47,430 --> 01:32:48,810
Ambush!

1063
01:33:06,450 --> 01:33:09,660
Wilkes, suppression fire. Shut them down.

1064
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,540
Stagger-step. Cover me.

1065
01:33:20,550 --> 01:33:21,590
Watch them!

1066
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,270
Cut us loose!

1067
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:36,360
Come on! Cut us loose!

1068
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:36,190
- We're good? - Yeah, let's go, let's go!

1069
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:11,100
Hey, Dom.

1070
01:36:17,350 --> 01:36:19,520
You've got to meet my son.

1071
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:21,560
Nico.

1072
01:36:26,320 --> 01:36:27,780
I will.

1073
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,950
He's a good kid.

1074
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:38,410
You know, we named him after you.

1075
01:36:40,210 --> 01:36:41,540
"Dominic."

1076
01:36:48,800 --> 01:36:50,800
You've got my word, Vince.

1077
01:36:57,350 --> 01:36:59,440
You were always my brother.

1078
01:37:09,070 --> 01:37:11,570
I got eyes on Nico now.

1079
01:37:22,250 --> 01:37:24,670
We need to move. We don't have that much time.

1080
01:37:24,750 --> 01:37:25,880
I got us a flight out.

1081
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:28,550
We can leave Rio in the rearview in the next five hours.

1082
01:37:28,630 --> 01:37:30,420
Not to run away.

1083
01:37:31,840 --> 01:37:33,430
To finish the job.

1084
01:37:34,260 --> 01:37:36,680
Are you crazy, Dom? We can't.

1085
01:37:37,260 --> 01:37:38,850
It's a suicide mission.

1086
01:37:39,930 --> 01:37:41,600
That's your man over there on the table.

1087
01:37:42,980 --> 01:37:45,020
The plan is busted!

1088
01:37:45,310 --> 01:37:47,820
This is bullshit, man. Reyes knows we're coming!

1089
01:37:47,900 --> 01:37:49,280
He's right.

1090
01:37:49,570 --> 01:37:52,360
They tripled the detail at the police station.

1091
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,030
it's going to be a wall of gunfire.

1092
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,330
Reyes doesn't get away with this.

1093
01:37:59,620 --> 01:38:00,620
It's a trap, man.

1094
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,120
You know that.

1095
01:38:02,790 --> 01:38:05,130
Dom, listen to them.

1096
01:38:05,790 --> 01:38:08,380
Run, before it's too late. Leave Rio.

1097
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:11,090
You can be free.

1098
01:38:13,260 --> 01:38:15,260
Running ain't freedom.

1099
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,140
You should know that.

1100
01:38:23,230 --> 01:38:25,650
You know you're all free to make your own choices.

1101
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:30,990
I'm in.

1102
01:38:40,370 --> 01:38:42,000
I'll ride with you, Toretto.

1103
01:38:45,290 --> 01:38:47,840
At least until we kill that son of a bitch.

1104
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:57,850
So what's the plan, Dom?

1105
01:38:58,680 --> 01:39:00,720
We can't just go sneaking around anymore.

1106
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:04,180
We don't sneak.

1107
01:39:04,980 --> 01:39:08,110
The only thing he cares about is his money.

1108
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,690
We pull that,

1109
01:39:10,690 --> 01:39:12,110
we pull him.

1110
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:30,540
See?

1111
01:39:31,710 --> 01:39:34,380
I called in every cop on our payroll.

1112
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,680
We're covered.

1113
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:40,800
We've got every entrance covered with weapons teams.

1114
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:43,640
God Himself couldn't get at your money if He wanted to.

1115
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:48,480
God isn't my worry.

1116
01:39:58,240 --> 01:39:59,240
You ready?

1117
01:40:01,530 --> 01:40:02,530
I'm ready.

1118
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:02,010
What's happening?

1119
01:41:02,090 --> 01:41:03,550
They're taking the vault!

1120
01:41:03,640 --> 01:41:05,310
- What? - The vault!

1121
01:41:14,860 --> 01:41:18,110
Follow me! Quickly!

1122
01:41:22,450 --> 01:41:23,950
Let me through!

1123
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:35,000
Don't move!

1124
01:41:36,210 --> 01:41:37,590
Stay down.

1125
01:42:07,580 --> 01:42:08,950
Call it out, Mia!

1126
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,540
You've got a straight shot for two blocks.

1127
01:42:12,040 --> 01:42:13,540
- Go right.- Got it.

1128
01:42:35,940 --> 01:42:37,520
Well, the plan is working.

1129
01:42:37,610 --> 01:42:40,780
You guys have every corrupt cop in Rio on your tail.

1130
01:42:40,780 --> 01:42:42,490
You have to move fast.

1131
01:42:42,570 --> 01:42:43,650
What's the best route?

1132
01:42:43,740 --> 01:42:46,990
Okay, keep going straight another half-mile onto Rua Fonseca,

1133
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,990
and then go left.

1134
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:53,790
That ain't going to work.

1135
01:42:55,870 --> 01:42:57,460
Spikes ahead, Dom. We got spikes!

1136
01:42:57,880 --> 01:42:59,460
We're going right!

1137
01:43:00,840 --> 01:43:02,130
No, it's too tight, we're not going to fit.

1138
01:43:02,210 --> 01:43:03,670
We've got no choice. Now!

1139
01:43:23,360 --> 01:43:24,530
Shit!

1140
01:43:31,160 --> 01:43:32,450
Holy shit!

1141
01:43:32,540 --> 01:43:34,130
Guys, I am hearing all this chatter.

1142
01:43:34,130 --> 01:43:35,410
Did you just take out a bank?

1143
01:43:44,460 --> 01:43:45,470
Two inbound!

1144
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,340
All right, there's an alley coming up on your left.

1145
01:43:49,430 --> 01:43:51,100
Yeah, I got it.

1146
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:46,110
You little bastard!

1147
01:45:09,260 --> 01:45:11,970
All right, good job, Dom. Right-hander, right here, right-hander.

1148
01:45:18,350 --> 01:45:20,390
Guys, there's a big group coming at you from the south.

1149
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,270
You have to do something now!

1150
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:26,190
Hey, go wide.

1151
01:47:13,840 --> 01:47:15,130
You're all clear on the left.

1152
01:47:15,220 --> 01:47:17,050
Good afternoon, officer!

1153
01:47:19,050 --> 01:47:21,470
License and registration, please!

1154
01:47:27,690 --> 01:47:30,570
Yes! This is big-boy stuff!

1155
01:47:30,650 --> 01:47:32,070
We're clear on the right.

1156
01:47:32,320 --> 01:47:33,400
Oh, man.

1157
01:47:40,200 --> 01:47:41,240
Thanks, guys.

1158
01:47:41,620 --> 01:47:42,740
Any time.

1159
01:47:43,040 --> 01:47:44,620
I'll see you on the other side.

1160
01:47:44,700 --> 01:47:47,000
You guys just carved out a 10-second window.

1161
01:47:47,080 --> 01:47:48,540
Make it count!

1162
01:47:55,880 --> 01:47:57,050
Zizi, stay on them.

1163
01:48:23,580 --> 01:48:25,500
They can't outrun us on the bridge.

1164
01:48:27,460 --> 01:48:28,460
Shit.

1165
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:36,760
They have no way out.

1166
01:48:38,760 --> 01:48:39,760
No!

1167
01:48:40,590 --> 01:48:41,680
There's too many of them.

1168
01:48:41,760 --> 01:48:43,720
Hey, there's too many of them. We're not going to make it.

1169
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:48,440
You're right, we aren't.

1170
01:48:49,730 --> 01:48:50,690
You are.

1171
01:48:50,770 --> 01:48:52,060
What are you talking about?

1172
01:48:52,270 --> 01:48:54,690
Just let the vault go. Get out of there.

1173
01:48:54,770 --> 01:48:56,480
You're a father now, Brian.

1174
01:48:56,570 --> 01:48:58,740
No, I'm not leaving you. Now you stick with the plan!

1175
01:48:59,450 --> 01:49:00,820
It was always the plan.

1176
01:49:01,570 --> 01:49:02,870
Take care of Mia.

1177
01:49:02,950 --> 01:49:05,370
Dom, you listen to me now. Okay?

1178
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:07,290
You cut loose right now.

1179
01:49:24,640 --> 01:49:25,680
Hey, what is he doing?

1180
01:49:29,640 --> 01:49:30,770
We've got him!

1181
01:49:47,620 --> 01:49:48,870
Close down the bridge!

1182
01:50:23,110 --> 01:50:24,490
Do something, asshole!

1183
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:37,710
Kill him, dammit!

1184
01:50:49,100 --> 01:50:50,560
Kill him now!

1185
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,960
I thought I told you to go on.

1186
01:52:06,930 --> 01:52:09,140
Yeah, I had to make a call.

1187
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:28,150
Help me.

1188
01:52:30,530 --> 01:52:32,530
That's for my team, you son of a bitch.

1189
01:52:36,700 --> 01:52:38,420
It's a hell of a mess.

1190
01:52:39,120 --> 01:52:40,750
Yeah, it is.

1191
01:52:42,250 --> 01:52:44,000
You know I can't let you two go.

1192
01:52:44,500 --> 01:52:46,090
I ain't made that way.

1193
01:52:48,840 --> 01:52:51,510
The way I see it, you've earned yourselves 24 hours.

1194
01:52:52,680 --> 01:52:53,680
The money stays, though.

1195
01:52:55,010 --> 01:52:57,180
If I were you, I'd use the time.

1196
01:52:57,520 --> 01:53:00,520
Make peace with whatever demons you got left.

1197
01:53:04,980 --> 01:53:06,860
Because come tomorrow,

1198
01:53:08,240 --> 01:53:09,360
I will find you.

1199
01:53:21,210 --> 01:53:22,500
Toretto!

1200
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:24,710
I'll see you soon.

1201
01:53:27,550 --> 01:53:29,420
No, you won't.

1202
01:54:10,880 --> 01:54:11,970
Thanks, guys.

1203
01:54:12,050 --> 01:54:13,550
I'll see you on the other side.

1204
01:54:18,430 --> 01:54:20,890
You guys just carved out a 10 second window.

1205
01:54:20,980 --> 01:54:22,270
Make it count!

1206
01:55:04,690 --> 01:55:06,400
Come on, baby.

1207
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:08,360
Don't be mean.

1208
01:55:10,610 --> 01:55:11,610
Come on.

1209
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:24,710
For Rosa and Nico. See you soon,

1210
01:56:39,740 --> 01:56:40,820
You sure about this?

1211
01:56:42,620 --> 01:56:44,080
You know I am.

1212
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,500
You don't need to do this.

1213
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:50,830
Just leave me alone.

1214
01:56:50,920 --> 01:56:52,960
Bro, I'm not trying to be negative, but casinos

1215
01:56:53,170 --> 01:56:54,040
are the kinds of places

1216
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:55,880
designed to take money from guys like you and me.

1217
01:56:56,050 --> 01:56:57,470
When I win here I'm buying

1218
01:56:57,470 --> 01:56:59,720
you a lifetime supply of antidepressants.

1219
01:57:00,010 --> 01:57:03,010
You don't put ten million on red!

1220
01:57:03,100 --> 01:57:04,060
Enough already.

1221
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:05,520
You put it on black.

1222
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:09,230
No more bets.

1223
01:57:35,250 --> 01:57:37,460
Right this way, my dear.

1224
01:57:39,510 --> 01:57:41,340
You stay right here, I'll be right back.

1225
01:57:43,180 --> 01:57:45,350
So, this is your dream, huh?

1226
01:57:45,430 --> 01:57:46,720
It's enough for me, man.

1227
01:57:46,810 --> 01:57:48,220
I take it that's your dream.

1228
01:57:48,310 --> 01:57:50,890
Absolutely. What up, boy? What's going on?

1229
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:52,770
- You good? - Yes, yes.

1230
01:57:52,850 --> 01:57:54,060
You know what's crazy?

1231
01:57:54,150 --> 01:57:56,730
There's only four of those cars in the whole world.

1232
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:59,690
Yeah, I got the only one in the Western Hemisphere.

1233
01:58:00,190 --> 01:58:04,490
I made a sheikh in Abu Dhabi an offer he could not refuse.

1234
01:58:04,820 --> 01:58:07,080
Huh. That's a nice lady you got there, too.

1235
01:58:07,160 --> 01:58:10,580
Absolutely. What's happening?

1236
01:58:11,370 --> 01:58:13,580
We got to go, man. Let's do this.

1237
01:58:13,670 --> 01:58:15,330
Okay, I'll drive.

1238
01:58:15,420 --> 01:58:17,960
In that? Come on, man, no way.

1239
01:58:18,050 --> 01:58:20,340
No, no. Not in this.

1240
01:58:20,420 --> 01:58:21,590
In that.

1241
01:58:27,930 --> 01:58:29,470
Are you serious right now?

1242
01:58:30,270 --> 01:58:31,600
Man, this is crazy!

1243
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,240
Yes, I guess that means

1244
01:58:33,240 --> 01:58:36,270
there are two in the Western Hemisphere, huh?

1245
01:58:37,150 --> 01:58:39,480
What's your smart ass got to say now?

1246
01:58:40,030 --> 01:58:43,450
You know what? We can always shine together, baby.

1247
01:58:43,530 --> 01:58:45,910
Get dressed, man, we got things to do!

1248
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:59,800
So, where to now?

1249
01:58:48,270 --> 01:58:49,330


1250
01:58:59,880 --> 01:59:01,420
I don't know.

1251
01:59:01,510 --> 01:59:03,880
Never been to Madrid.

1252
01:59:03,970 --> 01:59:06,720
I thought you wanted to go to Tokyo.

1253
01:59:06,800 --> 01:59:08,970
We'll get there.

1254
01:59:09,060 --> 01:59:10,680
Eventually.

1255
02:00:10,030 --> 02:00:11,870
Nice surprise.

1256
02:00:15,450 --> 02:00:17,120
Crazy, right?

1257
02:00:25,340 --> 02:00:28,380
This is the happiest I've ever seen my sister.

1258
02:00:29,430 --> 02:00:31,430
It's because we're free.

1259
02:00:44,780 --> 02:00:47,030
You know, I want another shot.

1260
02:00:50,570 --> 02:00:51,570
Yeah?

1261
02:00:53,660 --> 02:00:55,330
Yeah.

1262
02:00:55,410 --> 02:00:57,250
No wagers, nobody else.

1263
02:00:57,330 --> 02:00:59,500
Just you and me, once and for all.

1264
02:01:06,590 --> 02:01:08,550
You sure you can handle the disappointment?

1265
02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:10,840
Are you?

1266
02:01:13,140 --> 02:01:15,220
All right, O'Conner.

1267
02:01:17,660 --> 02:01:21,310


1268
02:01:15,310 --> 02:01:17,140
Let's see what you got.

1269
02:03:25,690 --> 02:03:30,230
Diplomatic security service headquarters - Washington, d.C.

1270
02:03:45,000 --> 02:03:46,830
You need to look at that.

1271
02:03:50,750 --> 02:03:52,710
Berlin. 3:00 a.m. This morning.

1272
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:55,760
A team of drivers hijacked a military convoy.

1273
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:57,680
- Toretto? - Nope.

1274
02:03:58,680 --> 02:03:59,640
I ain't interested.

1275
02:03:59,720 --> 02:04:02,560
Yes, you are. Keep looking.

1276
02:04:14,070 --> 02:04:15,900
Do you believe in ghosts?
