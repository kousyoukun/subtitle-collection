we're still about eight hours outside Houston.

we'll spend a night or two there,

I would have made you do the chemo.

89
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:16,881
Sweetheart, I taught you never to give up on your dreams

90
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:19,584
because you feel obligated to a man.

91
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,120
And that includes me.

92
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:24,422
We should have at least discussed it.

93
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:28,092

I'm really sorry, sir.

99
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,126
I wanted to wait to ask you first.

We can't leave.

114
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,178
I know.

115
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,214
How long do you think they'll hold our apartment?

116
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,751
I mean, they have our deposit, so, uh, you know,

117
00:06:26,753 --> 00:06:28,720
maybe a month.

118
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,189
What about your fellowship?

119
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,759
It's unpaid anyway.

120
00:06:34,761 --> 00:06:36,661
You should go.

121
00:06:36,663 --> 00:06:39,630
That's the perfect opportunity.

122
00:06:39,632 --> 00:06:41,199
I'm not leaving.

123
00:06:41,201 --> 00:06:43,534
But you saved up all last year

124
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:45,837
so you could take that opportunity.

125
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,472
With you.

126
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:50,274
That's our money.

127
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:52,443
It's for our future.

00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:58,216
I love you, babe. Hmm.

130
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,922
Miss Moore? Yes?

131
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,159
Hi, I'm Dr. Jones, your father's
attending physician.

132
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,660
I missed you the other day.

133
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:14,365
Um, Dr. Cook,
the hospital administrator,

134
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,847
needs to see you right away.

135
00:07:17,504 --> 00:07:19,837
Is there a problem?
Well, Monica,

136
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:23,307
your father's benefits have run
out for his hospital coverage.

137
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:26,711
It would only cover hospice care.

138
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:28,980
I... I don't understand.

139
00:07:28,982 --> 00:07:30,515
This is an itemized sheet,

140
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,885
showing that he's exhausted his acute care coverage

141
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,253
in the hospital.

142
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,621
But we have an excellent hospice program here.

143
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:38,890
Of course, it could be costly for patients

144
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,659
who don't have outside coverage
or assistance, you understand.

145
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:43,628
How much are we talking?

146
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,329
Well, it's a considerable amount.

147
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:46,998
You know, it depends on factors

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,300
like how long he'll be here,
which could be several months.

149
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,836
There's also home hospice care.

150
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:54,839
We could have someone take care of him at the house.

151
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:56,107
No.

152
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:58,309
Monica? No.

153
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,547
No. If my dad
is dying this way,

154
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:06,184
we are getting him the very best care until the end.

155
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:08,619
Until the end, Kevin.

156
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,790
I have some money saved.

157
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,759
We have some money saved.

158
00:08:14,761 --> 00:08:16,160
Okay.

159
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,198
We have to come up with...

160
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,936
$15,000,

161
00:08:24,938 --> 00:08:26,571
which has to be paid at once.

162
00:08:26,573 --> 00:08:28,873
And then, of course, there's next month's billing.

163
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:30,241
15,000?

164
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,210
COOK:
It's all right there, Monica.

165
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:34,912
And I wish I could pay half of it.

166
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:36,481
Not a fun part of my job.

167
00:08:36,483 --> 00:08:38,116
But the facts are the facts,

168
00:08:38,118 --> 00:08:40,651
so we have to figure it out.

169
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:44,422
Okay. Uh, not a problem.

170
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:48,426
We'll have the cheque for you in the morning.

171
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,829
Let's go.

172
00:08:56,903 --> 00:08:58,936
You said...

173
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,906
It's our money. I know.

174
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:04,675
$15,000.

175
00:09:04,677 --> 00:09:08,379
That's half of our savings.

176
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:12,650
It's okay.

177
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:16,254
I'm selling my car.

178
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:18,723
I'm paying you back.

179
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,292
I promise.

180
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:25,696
Well, who's that handsome fella?

181
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:27,331
Is that my Kevin?

182
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,433
Hey, Billie. Hi.

183
00:09:29,435 --> 00:09:32,303
How you holding up?

184
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,305
It that your famous tuna casserole?

185
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:36,107
You know it.
Well, then I'd say things

186
00:09:36,109 --> 00:09:38,476
just got considerably better.
(Laughing)

187
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:41,279
Let me bring you to Monica.
Okay.

188
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:46,851
(Sighing)

189
00:09:46,853 --> 00:09:48,786
I'm going to go check on Dad.

190
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:51,155
The tuna casserole was terrific.

191
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:52,390
Thanks, darling.

192
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,392
Be there in a bit.

193
00:09:56,896 --> 00:09:58,729
(Sighing)

194
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:06,237
This is going to take everything we have.

195
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,838
And then some.

196
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,608
(Sighing)

197
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:15,213
We need to get him the best treatment there is.

198
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,655
I don't care what I have to do.

199
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,353
Don't you think I love my brother enough

200
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:24,255
to make that happen?

201
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:29,727
You were in junior high when your mother got sick.

202
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,295
I was the one there,

203
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,599
helping your dad make all the hard decisions.

204
00:10:35,735 --> 00:10:37,802
In his first bout with cancer,

205
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,770
I was the one that was cleaning bedpans

206
00:10:39,772 --> 00:10:40,972
and helping raise you.

207
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,373
So don't come around here

208
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,508
spending money you know you don't have,

209
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,844
like you're the only one that gives a damn.

210
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,048
(Sighing)

211
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,651
Look...

212
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,553
sweetie.

213
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:00,925
You've got Kevin to think of too.

214
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:04,395
I mean, he has put his entire life on hold

215
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:08,032
to stay in Tallahassee so that you can finish school.

216
00:11:08,034 --> 00:11:10,534
And he is doing it again.

217
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:13,337
For you and your father.

218
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,339
That is a good man.

219
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,980
As hard as you're fighting for your father,

220
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:27,051
you need to protect your relationship too.

221
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,290
(Gasping)

222
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:34,025
Monica Moore?

223
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,593
Tasha?

224
00:11:35,595 --> 00:11:36,794
Yes.

225
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:39,163
Hi. Hey.

226
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:40,364
Mwah. Oh!

227
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,533
You look amazing.

228
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,769
I hardly recognize you.

229
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:48,005
I mean, I'd ask how you are,
but obviously you're doing well.

230
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:49,640
I am.

231
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,676
Okay, so tell me, what is new

232
00:11:51,678 --> 00:11:54,512
with HSPDAs favourite Ophelia, huh?

233
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:56,080
You still at FSU?

234
00:11:56,082 --> 00:11:58,482
I was. I just graduated.

235
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,285
Big part (Unclear)?

236
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:03,654
Oh, this. My fiancé, Kevin,

237
00:12:03,656 --> 00:12:07,124
he... It's one of his scripts.
He's a screenwriter.

238
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,894
Cool. The dynamic duo
or something?

239
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,395
Okay, so why y'all in Houston?

240
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,230
(Snapping fingers)
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Monica.

241
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,033
Stop talking.

242
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:17,935
Get back to work.

243
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:21,005
You work here?

244
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:24,775
Mani or pedi?

245
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:30,715
This ain't right.

246
00:12:30,717 --> 00:12:32,483
Come on, tell me, girl.
What's going on?

247
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,051
Dad's sick.

248
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:36,687
Kevin and I actually thought
we were on our way to L.A.

249
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,255
and just passing through.

250
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,125
Oh, my... He's been sick
since high school, huh?

251
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,861
I'm so sorry. Thanks.

252
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,430
I mean, you know, it's a rough time for sure.

253
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,300
There aren't many gigs in Houston

254
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:51,469
for a highly educated actress.

255
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:53,270
I mean, Aunt Billie got me this job here,

256
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:58,409
but it barely scratches the surface of Daddy's bills.

257
00:12:58,411 --> 00:12:59,710
You ever thought about dancing?

258
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:01,379
I've been working

259
00:13:01,381 --> 00:13:02,680
over at Hidden Treasures for a while now.

260
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:04,215
I could talk to my boss for you.

261
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:08,519
Uh, I don't know that Kevin would ever let me strip.

262
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:10,755
Why not? Y'all can make
quick money?

263
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:13,424
Take care of you and your dad's medical bills.

264
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:16,560
I don't know.
It sounds kind of dirty,

265
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:19,263
showing my vajayjay to a bunch of perverts.

266
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:20,498
No offence.

267
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,466
(Laughing): Your vajayjay.

268
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,869
It's a topless bar only, okay?

269
00:13:24,871 --> 00:13:26,570
The clientele, they're not some hood rats.

270
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,807
They're businessmen.
They're executives.

271
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,275
Contractors.

272
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:32,877
Seriously, it pays the bills.

273
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,446
Takes care of my rent, my tuition.

274
00:13:35,448 --> 00:13:37,615
Fills my refrigerator.

275
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:40,084
Doesn't even include the perks.

276
00:13:42,522 --> 00:13:45,289
Whatever.
It's not for everyone.

277
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,259
Think about it.

278
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50,094
Okay?

279
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,328
Okay.

280
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,630
Thank you.

281
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,532
See you, girl!

282
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,974
Girl, see what hard work does?

283
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,276
Pays off well.

284
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,611
Hard work, good tips.

285
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:27,598
What am I thinking?

286
00:14:32,438 --> 00:14:33,838
Monica.

287
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,105
Shit.

288
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:36,407
Monica Moore.

289
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:37,975
Hey, girl.

290
00:14:37,977 --> 00:14:39,643
Hey! Hi.

291
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:41,412
What's going on?

292
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,813
Change your mind?

293
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,382
No, I stopped by to return the tip.

294
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,851
It was too much.

295
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,953
Come on, it's not pity money.

296
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:51,856
Just helping a girlfriend out.

297
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:53,524
Seriously, want to come in?

298
00:14:53,526 --> 00:14:55,860
I got a bus to catch.

299
00:14:55,862 --> 00:14:57,161
Really?

300
00:14:57,163 --> 00:14:59,497
Come on, I'll give you
a ride home. Check it out.

301
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,899
Okay. Okay.

302
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,403
I usually work nights,

303
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,705
but I just have to pick something up.

304
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,373
You want a drink?

305
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,543
Okay, give me just a minute.

306
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,849
(Hip-hop music playing)

307
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,954

♪ What's my name again? ♪

315
00:15:37,403 --> 00:15:38,602
Only a thousand this time?

316
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,803
(Laughing)

317
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:41,472
Just kidding, sweetie.

318
00:15:41,474 --> 00:15:45,209
Don't forget now, I'm only working nights next week.

319
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:48,679
Okay, you ready to go?

320
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,052
What's wrong?

321
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,620
I hate the smell of nail polish.

322
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,322
(Laughing)

323
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,827
Is it hard, dancing for those strange men?

324
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,263
Maybe the first time.
But that's it.

325
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,585
I mean, after that it's, you know...

326
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:13,470
What is wrong with you?

327
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,741
My daddy's latest bill just came in the mail yesterday.

328
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:23,480
You really make all that money by dancing on stage?

329
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,649
Sort of.

330
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:30,721
Brandy booked that <i>CSI</i> pilot.

331
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,090
I know I would have gotten that gig.

332
00:16:33,092 --> 00:16:34,658
You would have.

333
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:39,763
Sandra said Brandy screwed the casting director.

334
00:16:41,033 --> 00:16:43,300
I mean, at least if you're going to have sex,

335
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,603
you might as well get something out of it, right?

336
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,909
Where is this coming from?

337
00:16:51,911 --> 00:16:53,243
God, I just miss performing.

338
00:16:53,245 --> 00:16:55,512
I mean, at least you can still write,

339
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,381
even in the midst of all this.

340
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,316
Why are you being like this?

341
00:16:59,318 --> 00:17:01,552
I'm just thinking about Daddy's bills.

342
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:03,253
Well, when I sell my script,

343
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:05,856
we're going to have all the money we ever needed.

344
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,392
But we need money now.

345
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,729
(Sighing)

346
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,699
I...

347
00:17:17,203 --> 00:17:19,703
I think I could make money dancing.

348
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,306
With a dance company?

349
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,874
No.

350
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:26,143
Tasha showed me around the club that she works at.

351
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,911
You know...

352
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,614
I mean, at first it seemed strange.

353
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,083
I was like, Can this be legal?

354
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:36,387
But...

355
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:40,658
after a few minutes, I mean, it all seemed pretty normal.

356
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:44,194
You went to a strip club?

357
00:17:44,196 --> 00:17:47,197
I saw a guy just give a chick $300.

358
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:49,833
And Tasha said on the night shift

359
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,303
that you can make up to $700 or more a night.

360
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,606
I mean, I figure if I danced every day,

361
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,808
I could make back our 30 grand in less than two months,

362
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:00,110
and pay Daddy's bills, and then maybe even

363
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:02,479
swing a few flights out to L.A.
for auditions.

364
00:18:02,481 --> 00:18:04,881
Or for you to take meetings.

365
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,120
Just until things get settled with Daddy.

366
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:14,024
And then we'll move out, you know, as planned.

00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,945
(Keys jiggling)

380
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,520
(Flipping light switches)

381
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:19,523
Light are off.

382
00:19:21,794 --> 00:19:24,261
(Both sighing)

383
00:19:26,232 --> 00:19:28,365
Kevin...

384
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:30,100
Yeah?

385
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:33,137
I've been thinking about the club.

386
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:37,474
I mean, it's not that much different than acting.

387
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:40,377
It's just playing a role.

388
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:46,216
I went topless in two of your student films, remember?

389
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,455
Besides, it's quick money.

390
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,827
I know this guy at work.

391
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,029
He sells weed on the side.

392
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,998
Quick legal money.

393
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,200
I'm about to lose my Dad.

394
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:05,335
What would I do if you got shot

395
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,271
or landed in jail?

396
00:20:07,273 --> 00:20:09,306
It's not going to happen.
It's just weed.

397
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:14,244
No. Dancing is the only way
to make money fast.

398
00:20:14,246 --> 00:20:15,546
And you know it.

399
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:18,182
This isn't just about Daddy.
This is about us.

400
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:21,852
If we get stuck here, we'll never leave.

401
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:28,058
(Sighing)

402
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:31,361
We can try it for a week.

403
00:20:31,363 --> 00:20:33,463
(Laughing)

404
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,469
I promised your dad

405
00:20:39,471 --> 00:20:41,438
I wouldn't let you give up on your dreams

406
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,641
and while I'm making progress, you're saving.

407
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:49,847
And besides, I always wanted sexy lap dance from my baby.

408
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:51,114
Okay.

409
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:54,218
There's got to be some rules now.

410
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:56,253
Okay.

411
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,360
There's no dancing at that club if I'm not there.

412
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:06,463
What if you're at work?
We'll figure it out.

413
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,165
I'll be there to walk you to and from the car,

414
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:09,833
otherwise it's just not safe.

415
00:21:09,835 --> 00:21:11,401
Okay.

416
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,239
And as soon as I've made enough money, we're out.

417
00:21:15,241 --> 00:21:18,108
Number two, there's no drinking at that club, all right?

418
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,943
Stay sharp. It's just work.

419
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,112
Number three:

420
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:25,015
no outside parties,

421
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:26,717
VIP. MONICA: Ew.

422
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:30,053
You think I want some creep
to finger-bang me?

423
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,323
No, just...

424
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,025
just stage and lap dances only.

425
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:40,764
Number four: we don't see
anybody from the club

426
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,299
outside the club.

427
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:44,001
(No audio)

428
00:21:44,003 --> 00:21:45,669
And number five:

429
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,271
no drugs.

430
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:50,908
You are the one that smokes weed.

431
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:52,542
I do smoke weed.

432
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,280
And lastly...

433
00:21:56,282 --> 00:22:00,050
no turning me down when I want some good loving.

434
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,920
Okay.

435
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,055
And that last rule starts right now.

436
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,492
Thank you for being
so open-minded

437
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:11,028
and wanting to try this.

438
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,330
And I promise

439
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:18,368
you'll get plenty
of good love-making.

440
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:21,638
KEVIN: I better get that.

You want to get that?

456
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:18,095
Uh, no, no. I'm good.
We're good. Sorry.

457
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:20,831
Still no answer? No.

458
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:23,100
So, what? If he doesn't show
you're just not going to dance?

459
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:24,301
I promised him I wouldn't.

460
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,703
Hmm. Good luck with that.

461
00:23:26,705 --> 00:23:28,505
What does that mean?

462
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:31,475
Girl, having your man sit in the club while you dancing?

463
00:23:31,477 --> 00:23:34,745
That's going to throw you off your game.

464
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,280
Going to put you
on Matt E.'s bad list.

465
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,683
Cost you a high roller.

466
00:23:39,685 --> 00:23:41,418
High roller?

467
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,253
We got a regular client, well off.

468
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,322
You know, they're a high score.

469
00:23:45,324 --> 00:23:48,592
You see my girl out there on stage, Lexus?

470
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:50,927
She is a top moneymaker.

471
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,295
She got Chicago, girl.

472
00:23:52,297 --> 00:23:55,565
The finest man in the city.

473
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:58,502
Baby Girl, you're up in 10.

474
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:01,471
And you'd better tip out when you dance here.

475
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,675
What's her problem?

476
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:07,110
She just mad because she can't work

477
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,912
that pole no more.

478
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,049
So, you going on?

479
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,688
(Cell phone ringing)
Um...

480
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:20,157
I... I apologize.

481
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,792
You know, I need 30 seconds.

482
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,326
Go ahead.

483
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,164
Uh, hey, babe.
Babe, where are you?

484
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,166
The meeting just started 20 minutes ago.

485
00:24:29,168 --> 00:24:30,567
Did you get the job?

486
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,335
Um, I don't know.

487
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,970
He's just looking at the storyboards.

488
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:37,908
Well, I'm on in 10 minutes.
What do you want me to do?

489
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,543
<i>Kevin,</i>

490
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,445
we've been working up for this the past two weeks.

491
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:43,380
If I chicken out, they'll fire me.

492
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:44,948
Uh...

493
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:46,483
you know, just...

494
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,251
Just do it.

495
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,753
I'll get there when I can.

496
00:24:49,755 --> 00:24:51,521
Are you sure?

497
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,590
Yeah.

498
00:24:53,592 --> 00:24:55,826
Okay. I got to go.

499
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:57,828
Monica? What?

500
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,297

I want five songs.

They're 20 each.
That's like $100.

514

What's going on?

519
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,895
I want my money back.
What are you doing?

00:26:15,207 --> 00:26:18,608
Okay, well, Matt E. let's them
touch anything but the na-na.

526
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,977
Okay? So when you're
on the floor, that fine.

00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,379
In the VIP...

528
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,914
I don't remember you telling me that.

529
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,315
Well, I did tell you that.

530
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,517
Okay, dancing on the main stage is okay,

531
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,386
but walking the floor is hustling for lap dances?

532
00:26:29,388 --> 00:26:31,555
Monica, calm down, okay?
I can't do it.

533
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,590
Okay, well, you're going to have to, okay?

534
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,259
First time, it's the hardest.
After that it's fine.

535
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,395
I told you, okay? Drink this.
What is it?

It something to make you relax.

Drink it. I promise.
Close your eyes.

538
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,900
I don't know. Look and think

00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,850
Of course, of course.
All right?

662
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,251
You got your friends with you.
Yup.

663
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,586
Hi, ladies.

664
00:32:36,588 --> 00:32:37,921
ALL: Hey.

665
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:41,357
There goes my luxury ride.

666
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,581
ROSCOE: I got the VIP

667
00:32:42,607 --> 00:32:44,093
all set up for you now.

668
00:32:44,095 --> 00:32:45,795
Thanks, baby.

669
00:32:47,165 --> 00:32:49,132
What's up?

670
00:32:49,134 --> 00:32:50,934
So, uh...

671
00:32:52,404 --> 00:32:55,204
when are you going to let me
taste some of that sweet stuff?

672
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,040
Hmm.

673
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,141
Never.

674
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,476
(Laughing)
Oh, it's like that?

675
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,278
What?

676
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,080
I got diabetes anyway.

677
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:06,516
That's why you only get a 50.
Here.

678
00:33:06,518 --> 00:33:09,485
Mmm, Jade Lee, my favourite jewel.

679
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,220
What's up, baby? Hi.

680
00:33:11,222 --> 00:33:12,889
Mm-hmm. Say hey.

681
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,724
How are you? Better now.

682
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,160
Mmm. Look at you. Yeah.

683
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:19,262
That's what I'm talking about.
You ready?

684
00:33:19,264 --> 00:33:20,964
Yeah. Absolutely.

685
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,600
Yeah.

686
00:33:32,043 --> 00:33:34,844
Watch yourself around those guys.

687
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,726
EMCEE: Tasha to the main stage.

688
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:39,649
Who's the newbie?

689
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,317
That's Monica.

690
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,752
She goes by Baby Girl.

691
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,954
CHICAGO:
Yeah, she's sexy as hell, too.

692
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:47,423
Get her up here.
I want to meet her.

693
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:49,392
She don't work the VIP.

694
00:33:56,935 --> 00:33:58,901
Someone in VIP wants to meet you.

695
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:00,236
He's a movie director.

696
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,704
Told him you wanted to be an actress.

697
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,973
Seriously?

698
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:06,142
Babe, you can show him your screenplays.

699
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,311
Oh, no. Just... Just you.

700
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:09,712
Oh.

701
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,314
I'll keep him company.

702
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,449
Okay.

703
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,951
It's okay.

704
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:17,120
I know we said no VIP.
This could be your big break.

705
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,489
Whatever gets us out of here faster.

706
00:34:19,491 --> 00:34:20,690
You sure?

707
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:22,992
Nope.

708
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,227
Mwah.

709
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:32,368
Hi. Hi.

710
00:34:37,709 --> 00:34:39,409
(Men laughing)

711
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,414
Hi.

712
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,417
Meet Monica.

713
00:34:55,226 --> 00:34:58,227
MATT:
You need anything, boss man?

714
00:34:58,229 --> 00:35:00,129
Yeah. Uh, tell Lexus

715
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,799
to bring me a bottle of Dom Pérignon.

716
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:04,200
You heard the man.

717
00:35:07,338 --> 00:35:09,005
EMCEE:
Sugar. Sugar to the main stage.

718
00:35:09,007 --> 00:35:11,808
And after that, Baby Girl.

719
00:35:14,679 --> 00:35:17,159
Sorry about that. She's crazy.

720
00:35:23,254 --> 00:35:26,656
Uh, Jade Lee told me that you're in the movie business?

721
00:35:26,658 --> 00:35:28,825
(Laughing)

722
00:35:28,827 --> 00:35:31,194
You could say I dabble a little bit.

723
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,296
I'm an actress.

724
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:36,065
Really?

725
00:35:36,067 --> 00:35:38,701
How come you're not in Hollywood?

726
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,037
I was actually driving to Los Angeles,

727
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:45,441
until we discovered that my dad's cancer relapsed.

728
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:46,843
Man...

729
00:35:46,845 --> 00:35:49,512
Trying to make money to care for him.

730
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,414
Sorry to hear that.

731
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:54,350
You should let me help you out with that.

732
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,394
That's $1,000.

733
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:08,664
Thank you.

734
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,500
Um...

735
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:12,268
Chicago.

736
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,704
You're Chicago?
You're a director?

737
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,106
(Laughing)

738
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,841
Not unless you're talking

739
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,163
about a couple
of horror movies, boo-boo.

740
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,114
Give me a minute.

741
00:36:25,116 --> 00:36:29,318
Wait, I just gave you $1,000.

742
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,720
EMCEE: Come on, gentlemen.

743
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,388
Tip your waitresses.

744
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,725
Chicago is trying to give me $1,000 to dance for him.

745
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,426
Isn't he with Lexus?

746
00:36:37,428 --> 00:36:39,262
No, everybody's dancing with Chicago.

747
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,997
Come on, nobody's been offered that much money, though.

748
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:42,398
Take it. Are you sure?

749
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,100
I mean, I can't be making any enemies.

750
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,669
No. Get the money. Take it. Go.

751
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:48,137
EMCEE: Tasha to the main stage.

752
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:51,307
So, Monica tells me you're a writer.

753
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:53,109
I am.

754
00:36:54,612 --> 00:36:56,646
So, where were we?

755
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,847
Uh...

756
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,183
you want that dance?

757
00:37:00,185 --> 00:37:03,519
So this is your first time in VIP, huh?

758
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,589
Anything goes up here.

759
00:37:06,591 --> 00:37:09,425
Even sex.

760
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,027
Well...

761
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,930
you'll have to get Lexus if that's what you want.

762
00:37:13,932 --> 00:37:15,198
Oh, really?

763
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,966
You think that's what I want?

764
00:37:16,968 --> 00:37:20,703
$1,000 is a lot of money

765
00:37:20,705 --> 00:37:22,738
just for a dance.

766
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,040
I don't want a dance, sweetheart.

767
00:37:24,042 --> 00:37:25,441
I just want to talk.

768
00:37:25,443 --> 00:37:26,976
Talk?

769
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,445
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

770
00:37:29,447 --> 00:37:31,681
Let me reintroduce myself to you.

771
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:34,517
Hi, my name is Jorge.

772
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,819
My friends like to call me Chicago.

773
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,487
Monica.

774
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:40,489
My friends call me Mo.

775
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:42,091
Pleasure.

776
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,263
You've been drinking.

777
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,099
I'm pretty sure you just broke rule number one.

778
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:53,135
You broke a lot of rules tonight.

779
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:57,506
I think we need to re-establish
some guidelines.

780
00:38:04,182 --> 00:38:07,350
So how'd you like your first night stripping in the VIP?

781
00:38:07,352 --> 00:38:10,219
I didn't actually strip.
I just talked.

782
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:15,057
Something you and I aren't doing a lot of lately.

783
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:16,759
That's all I'm doing now.

784
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,394
Just talking.

785
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:21,364
You like what you do?

786
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:24,267
You look like you were eating up
all the attention up there.

787
00:38:24,269 --> 00:38:26,702
It's just acting to me.

788
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:31,073
So those guys touching your breasts and your ass,

789
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:34,043
that's just method acting, huh?

790
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:37,413
I look like I enjoy it.

791
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:42,318
The client is happy.

792
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,721
They buy more dances, and we make more money.

793
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:48,891
Tonight that's all the client wanted, was talking.

794
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,693
Yeah.

795
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,728
That's all.

796
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:54,630
So, who's your new BFF?

797
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,700
Chicago.

798
00:38:57,702 --> 00:39:01,270
Well, Jorge, actually.

799
00:39:01,272 --> 00:39:03,205
He wasn't a director,

800
00:39:03,207 --> 00:39:05,207
but I think he owns a record label.

801
00:39:05,209 --> 00:39:08,411
He gave me $3,000 to help us out.

802
00:39:08,413 --> 00:39:10,179
Just for talking?
Sounds like bullshit.

803
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,849
Bullshit? I'm just trying
to make money for my dad and us.

804
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,652
Don't let the money change you.

805
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,695

How much longer you here for?
KEVIN: Uh, we're not sure.

844
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:43,599
We're waiting to find out what happens with Monica's dad,

845
00:41:43,601 --> 00:41:45,134
and then we're going
to head out to L.A.

846
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:46,602
How about you two?

847
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:48,104
Boyfriends?

848
00:41:48,106 --> 00:41:49,772
(Laughing)

849
00:41:49,774 --> 00:41:50,973
No.

850
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,442
Ahem, so, um, what do you write?

851
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:55,544
I picked up some freelance copywriting.

852
00:41:55,546 --> 00:41:57,413
And I'm currently working on a feature,

853
00:41:57,415 --> 00:42:01,684
tentatively titled <i>A Man's Guide to Understanding Women.</i>

854
00:42:01,686 --> 00:42:02,885
(Chuckling)

855
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,954
That sounds intriguing.

856
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,989
I told him it's going to take more than one movie

857
00:42:06,991 --> 00:42:08,624
to understand women.

858
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,861
You need at least two sequels.

859
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,131
Thanks for inviting us over.

860
00:42:15,133 --> 00:42:17,933
You guys ever roll before?

861
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:20,603
Roll what? (Laughing)

862
00:42:20,605 --> 00:42:22,204
(Chuckling)

863
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:24,006
You're so sweet and innocent.

864
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:26,408
Uh, never taken X before?

865
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:29,912
I don't really do any drugs.

866
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:33,949
Um, I mean, I've heard of it.

867
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,551
It's harmless, actually.

868
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:39,021
Just takes your sense of touch to a whole another level.

869
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:40,222
Mm-hmm.

870
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,591
LEXUS: Feels like magic.

871
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:46,101
You have to try it.
It's so cool.

872
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,899
Oh, but I get it if you're scared.

874

I'm not scared.

875
00:42:56,374 --> 00:42:57,773
You want to try it?

876
00:42:57,775 --> 00:42:59,175
If you want to.

877
00:43:00,545 --> 00:43:02,511

883
00:43:31,475 --> 00:43:33,876
to kiss Monica on the lips.

884
00:43:33,878 --> 00:43:36,111

885
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,114

See? That wasn't
all so bad, right?

891
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:08,344
Okay, Jade Lee.

892

So, listen, listen.

927
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:17,800
When you get off work,

928
00:47:17,802 --> 00:47:20,235
I want you to come over to my house tonight.

929

You know I don't do that.

930

What? Relax.
It's not even like that.

931
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:31,880
I'm having a little
get-together at my place,

932

and I want all of my friends there.

933

(Chuckling)

00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,132
Handsome cash.

940
00:47:50,134 --> 00:47:52,468
You're just taking all of my money.

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going, baby?

943
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:00,843
Just going to the VIP, man.

944
00:48:00,845 --> 00:48:03,412
No, no, no.
This is for VIP, not BAP.

945
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:04,847
That stands
for Broke-Ass People.

946
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,782
You want to go upstairs, you got to have a bottle.

947
00:48:06,784 --> 00:48:09,017
Okay, how much is a bottle?

948
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:10,619
$500.

949
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:13,288
Roscoe, I don't have 500 fucking bucks, man.

950
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:17,626
I know. That's why it's for VIP,
not BAP.

951
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,895
Roscoe, that's my fucking fiancée, okay?

952
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:22,898
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

953
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,199
Hey, easy.

954
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:27,436
Kev, you got to go.

955
00:48:27,438 --> 00:48:29,238
I ain't saying you got to go home,

956
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,806
but you should go home.

957
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:32,674
For what? What do I have
to go home for?

958
00:48:32,676 --> 00:48:34,276
Causing problems in my club.

959
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,545
I'm not causing any problems in your club, man.

960
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,680
Look, I like you,

961
00:48:38,682 --> 00:48:40,349
and I tell a lot of people that,

962
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:44,219
but I really like you, and we talked about this before,

963
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:47,556
but dancers that bring their boyfriends into the club,

964
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:49,291
it just doesn't mix.

965
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,393
It's bad for business.

966
00:48:51,395 --> 00:48:52,895
What's that I always say, Trudy?

967
00:48:52,897 --> 00:48:54,696
TRUDY:
It's fun visiting Disney Land,

968
00:48:54,698 --> 00:48:56,598
but it sure ain't fun working there.

969
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,234
Your mouth to God's ears.

970
00:48:59,236 --> 00:49:00,869
Now, look, Kevin,

971
00:49:00,871 --> 00:49:04,306
in all my years in this business,

972
00:49:04,308 --> 00:49:05,707
I've seen everything.

973
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,910
Hell, Roscoe and I we've done half of them.

974
00:49:07,912 --> 00:49:11,480
But there's one thing, one thing that never changes.

975
00:49:11,482 --> 00:49:13,615
And that is...

976
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:17,219
it's the money that brings the girls in,

977
00:49:17,221 --> 00:49:21,156
but it's the attention that keeps them coming back.

978
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:23,525
Now your little baby doll, your sweet Monica,

979
00:49:23,527 --> 00:49:25,160
she's upstairs right now,

980
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:27,896
and she's had a taste of this life.

981
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,934
And she ain't coming back.

982
00:49:31,936 --> 00:49:34,436
That's cute, but you're wrong.

983
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,605
She's not like that. Sorry.

984
00:49:36,607 --> 00:49:39,141
Well, either you're leaving...

985
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:41,476
or she is.

986
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,211
It's your choice.

987
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,550
EMCEE: Last call for alcohol.

988
00:49:48,552 --> 00:49:50,052
Last call.

989
00:50:04,802 --> 00:50:06,435
LEXUS: And she didn't
even have my money.

990
00:50:06,437 --> 00:50:08,337
Where's Chicago, girl?

991
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:09,538
(Laughing)

992
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:11,106
Oh, over there.

00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:12,307
Looking good, ladies.

994
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:13,642
Hi. Good to see you.

995
00:50:13,644 --> 00:50:15,143
Don't hurt nobody.

996
00:50:15,145 --> 00:50:16,778
(Laughing)

997
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:19,715
Wow.

998
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:24,987
He's been waiting for you.

999
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,288
Yes.

1000
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:37,933
Hey, beautiful. Hey.

1001
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,334
Glad you could make it.

1002
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:40,569
Of course.

1003
00:50:40,571 --> 00:50:42,638
Your place is fabulous.

1004
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,239
Ha-ha. Thank you, thank you.

1005
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,642
Come on. Come and meet
some of my friends. Let's go.

1006
00:50:46,644 --> 00:50:48,377
What's up?

1007
00:50:48,379 --> 00:50:50,345
Oh, man. I'm good, I'm good.
Good to see you, brother.

1008
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:51,546
Meet a good friend of mine.

1009
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,115
Monica, meet Wesley Jonathan.

1010
00:50:53,117 --> 00:50:55,183
Wesley Jonathan, Monica Moore.

1011
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:56,385
Nice to meet you.

1012
00:50:56,387 --> 00:50:57,753
I own all of your movies.

1013
00:50:57,755 --> 00:50:59,221
Oh, thank you.

1014
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:02,491
Yeah, Chicago says, uh, great things about you.

1015
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:03,759
He does? Mm-hmm.

1016
00:51:03,761 --> 00:51:05,027
CHICAGO:
And you know the mayor, right?

1017
00:51:05,029 --> 00:51:06,561
Mayor Williamson, meet Monica.

1018
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:07,763
The pleasure's all mine.

1019
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:09,731
Thank you. A friend of mine.

1020
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,833
(Indistinct chattering)

1021
00:51:11,835 --> 00:51:14,002
I am so jealous.

1022
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:15,704
Give me a little bit.
A little bit.

1023
00:51:15,706 --> 00:51:17,105
Ooh, yeah.

1024
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:19,174
And Scipio.

1025
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:20,709
Rap star.

1026
00:51:20,711 --> 00:51:22,577
Nice to meet you.

1027
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,212
And you know Pauly.

1028
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:25,781
A good friend of mine.
Keith Robinson.

1029
00:51:25,783 --> 00:51:27,416
Keith. How are you?

1030
00:51:27,418 --> 00:51:29,718
I'm good, how are you?
I'm great. Pleasure to meet you.

1031
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:32,120
Pleasure to meet you as well.

1032
00:51:32,122 --> 00:51:34,256
I love your music.

1033
00:51:34,258 --> 00:51:35,724
Oh, well, thank you so much.

1034
00:51:35,726 --> 00:51:37,092
Yeah. Yeah.

1035
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,694
(Laughing)
Good to finally meet you.

1036
00:51:38,696 --> 00:51:40,162
Give me one second.

1037
00:51:40,164 --> 00:51:41,596
Okay.

1038
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:43,832
(Whispering)

1039
00:51:43,834 --> 00:51:45,567
Hey, girl, you look good.

1040
00:51:45,569 --> 00:51:46,902
So do you. (Laughing)

1041
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:49,371
(Indistinct chattering)

1042
00:51:49,373 --> 00:51:50,639
Excuse me one second.

1043
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:52,140
Okay. (Clearing throat)

1044
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:53,742
(Glass clinking)

1045
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:55,377
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

1046
00:51:55,379 --> 00:51:57,446
can I have your attention, please, just for one second.

1047
00:51:57,448 --> 00:51:58,680
(Music turns off)

1048
00:51:58,682 --> 00:52:01,483
I have a special request from the host,

1049
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,118
the master of ceremony.

1050
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,388
He wanted to do a special song for the lady in his life.

1051
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,157
It goes a little something like this.

1052
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,327

1053

1062
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:45,060
Wow.

1063
00:52:45,062 --> 00:52:46,461
KEITH:
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1064
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:49,564
Salud, salud.
Y'all party tonight, man.

1065
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:53,168
All right?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1066
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,806
Where the hell you been?

1067
00:52:57,808 --> 00:53:00,308
It's 6:00 in the fucking
morning.

1068
00:53:00,310 --> 00:53:02,077
Me and the girls got a bite to eat.

1069
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:04,846
Must have lost track of time.

1070
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,349
I was worried.

1071
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:09,351
Sorry, babe.

1072
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,653
Next time, call.

1073
00:53:11,655 --> 00:53:14,890
Almost made enough money to cover Dad's next bill.

1074
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,193
Whatever.

1075
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,995
Good night.

1076
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:25,433
(Rock music playing)

1077
00:53:25,435 --> 00:53:27,269
(Cell phone ringing)

1078
00:53:32,943 --> 00:53:35,043
<i>Hello?</i> Hey, beautiful.

1079
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,845
Chicago?
<i>You still got those dreams</i>

1080
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:39,181
<i>of being a Hollywood actress?</i>
How'd you get this number?

1081
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:41,983
<i>Come on. You know I know
everybody in the city.</i>

1082
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:44,119
A good friend of mine, a big movie producer,

1083
00:53:44,121 --> 00:53:46,521
is throwing a wrap party for his latest film.

1084
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:48,790
He invited me out.
I want you to come with me.

1085
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,592
Um, where?

1086
00:53:50,594 --> 00:53:52,594
<i>Here?</i> No, it's in Los Angeles.

1087
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:56,398
I can't.
I'm at the hospital with my dad.

1088
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,501
You sure? I mean, we could take
the red-eye out right after.

1089
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:00,969
I can't.

1090
00:54:00,971 --> 00:54:03,038
I mean, I was going to compensate you for your time,

1091
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,373
but I'll just check you when I get back in town.

1092
00:54:05,375 --> 00:54:07,175
No, wait.

1093
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,510
I'll go.

1094
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,011
Okay, cool.

1095
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:11,880
Meet me at the club in two hours.

1096
00:54:11,882 --> 00:54:13,682
All right, bye.

1097
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,217
(Phone beeping off)

1098
00:54:15,219 --> 00:54:17,385
I see how you look at her.

1099
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:20,322
I know something's going on.

1100
00:54:21,992 --> 00:54:23,825
Are you fucking her?

1101
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,327
I'm watching the game.

1102
00:54:25,329 --> 00:54:28,563
What about me? My music?

1103
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,365
Answer me.

1104
00:54:31,535 --> 00:54:33,468
(Turns TV off)

1105
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,570
Lexus,

1106
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:38,306
you don't ask me questions.

1107
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,242
You answer them.

1108
00:54:41,545 --> 00:54:43,945
Am I fucking clear?

1109
00:54:45,415 --> 00:54:46,615
Okay.

1110
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:49,417
Yeah.

1111
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,920
Good.

1112
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,995
(Laughing)

1113
00:54:59,997 --> 00:55:01,963
There's my Baby Girl.

1114
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:04,466
I didn't wake you, did I?

1115
00:55:06,603 --> 00:55:08,270
(Laughing)

1116
00:55:08,272 --> 00:55:11,339
People wonder why we don't have photos of us together.

1117
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:14,676
Where are you going, sweetheart?

1118
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:16,344
Work.

1119
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:21,249
And you need to rest.

1120
00:55:21,251 --> 00:55:22,884
Oh.

1121
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:24,619
I slept enough today.

1122
00:55:27,057 --> 00:55:30,392
You remember that time I was visiting you at FSU,

1123
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:33,261
and I caught you in that car with some boy?

1124
00:55:33,263 --> 00:55:34,696
Randy?

1125
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:36,231
Randy. Dad, he's just a friend.

1126
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,333
I've told you that a million times.

1127
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:40,802
I just needed a ride across campus.

1128
00:55:40,804 --> 00:55:45,540
I know. I shouldn't take a ride
if I can walk myself.

1129
00:55:45,542 --> 00:55:48,176
Because if you do...

1130
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,945
You'll owe him a favour.

1131
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:52,647
BOTH: And you never want

1132
00:55:52,649 --> 00:55:55,150
to owe anybody

1133
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:59,654
for something you can do yourself.

1134
00:56:18,475 --> 00:56:19,674
Take this.

1135
00:56:19,676 --> 00:56:21,643
A hundred bucks?

1136
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,011
(Sighing)

1137
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:24,579
What about my field trip money?

1138
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:27,182
Look, just get something to eat for you and your brothers,

1139
00:56:27,184 --> 00:56:29,250
and pay the rent up at the motel.

1140
00:56:29,252 --> 00:56:32,420
I'll take care of it tomorrow, okay, Auri?

1141
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,255
Okay, Mom.

1142
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:37,692
Hey, Mr. Roscoe
will get you a cab.

1143
00:56:37,694 --> 00:56:39,594
I love you.

1144
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,730
I love you too, Mom.

1145
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,365
(Cell phone ringing)

1146
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:46,935
Yeah?

1147
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:48,670
What time are you coming?

1148
00:56:48,672 --> 00:56:52,474
Okay, I'll meet you in the parking lot like I did before.

1149
00:56:52,476 --> 00:56:54,609
Okay, bye.

1150
00:56:55,712 --> 00:56:56,978
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1151
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,880
I think you need to slow it down.

1152
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:01,616
What?

1153
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:03,518
You and Chicago are getting closer.

1154
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:05,387
And maybe that's not my business,

1155
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,322
but you have a good thing with Kevin.

1156
00:57:07,324 --> 00:57:10,058
It's rare. Special.

1157
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,826
You're right.

1158
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:14,029
It's not your business.

1159
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:15,797
Just don't get sucked up in the bullshit.

1160
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:17,932
MONICA: Chicago's just trying to
help me with my acting career.

1161
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,502
He's never asked me for sex.

1162
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:23,238
I've never even given him a lap dance.

1163
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:25,940
Yeah. So far.

1164
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:28,410
So far? Sugar, I ain't you,
okay?

1165
00:57:28,412 --> 00:57:30,612
I'm not going to be living in a motel with my three kids.

1166
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:34,382
I got a plan.
I know what I'm doing.

1167
00:57:40,023 --> 00:57:41,756
Hmm.

1168
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:09,717
Hey.

1169
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:15,190
Did you read my script?

1170
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,193
(Sighing)

1171
00:58:19,563 --> 00:58:21,796
I think it's time to take a break from writing,

1172
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:26,401
and focus on us making the money
we need to get out of here.

1173
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:28,803
Can't do it all myself.

1174
00:58:30,407 --> 00:58:32,941
What, are you kidding?
What do you think I'm doing?

1175
00:58:32,943 --> 00:58:36,044
I'm busting my ass at Kinkos for minimum wage.

1176
00:58:36,046 --> 00:58:37,312
I'm whoring myself,

1177
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:39,013
begging to sell copy for spark plugs.

1178
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,482
And let's not forget about the year

1179
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:44,219
I fucked my life away in Tallahassee for you.

1180
00:58:52,596 --> 00:58:55,029
I'll get you the rest as soon as I can,

1181
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,999
that way you can stop holding all your little sacrifices

1182
00:58:58,001 --> 00:58:59,667
over my head.

1183
00:59:01,571 --> 00:59:03,805
What'd you have to do for this kind of money?

1184
00:59:04,975 --> 00:59:08,409
I sucked a big, black dick.

1185
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,078
Watch your fucking mouth, Monica.

1186
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:12,480
Watch your fucking mouth, Monica.

1187
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:15,517
I didn't do anything, Kevin.

1188
00:59:27,264 --> 00:59:29,030
I called you all night last night.

1189
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,231
(Clearing throat)

1190
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:31,699
Why didn't you pick up?

1191
00:59:31,701 --> 00:59:35,303
My battery died.
It's tired, just like I am.

1192
00:59:35,305 --> 00:59:37,605
Tired? Yeah, tired, okay?

1193
00:59:37,607 --> 00:59:40,608
I'm sick of all your put-downs
and your neediness.

1194
00:59:40,610 --> 00:59:43,511
Your jabs. I'm sick of it.

1195
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:56,224
Your dad's bills are almost paid up.

1196
00:59:56,226 --> 00:59:58,159
When's enough money enough?

1197
00:59:58,161 --> 01:00:00,328
Our goal is 30.

1198
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,963
Is that okay?

1199
01:00:01,965 --> 01:00:03,865
Is that our goal?

1200
01:00:03,867 --> 01:00:05,800
Our goal?

1201
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,902
LEXUS: <i>When was the last
time you talked to Kevin?</i>

1202
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:11,105
Not since that night.

1203
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,840
You haven't fucked him again?

1204
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:15,610
I'm not trying to move in on Monica's man.

1205
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,012
Plus, I didn't think you'd want me to anyway.

1206
01:00:18,014 --> 01:00:19,414
She wouldn't even notice.

1207
01:00:19,416 --> 01:00:21,983
That dirty bitch is too busy jocking Chicago.

1208
01:00:21,985 --> 01:00:23,518
I mean, what did Kevin say?

1209
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:26,921
He doesn't trust her.

1210
01:00:26,923 --> 01:00:28,790
He said he goes through her purse every now and then.

1211
01:00:28,792 --> 01:00:32,360
Besides, you and Chicago have
that off-and-on relationship.

1212
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,761
She's just a new piece of ass,

1213
01:00:33,763 --> 01:00:35,563
and once he gets tired of looking at it,

1214
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:38,032
he's going to be right back to you anyway.

1215
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,801
So, what do you care?

1216
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:42,270
I just do.

1217
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:50,311
(Sighing)

1218
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,846
What about us?

1219
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,082
I mean, you said we were going to start a family

1220
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:55,917
once the move.

1221
01:00:55,919 --> 01:00:57,485
We will.

1222
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:01,689
Just let me get through this thing with Chicago, okay?

1223
01:01:01,691 --> 01:01:03,491
All right.

She always tell me when the guys are touching her

never share you with strangers.

Come on.

You don't really believe that, do you?

1259
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,933
I mean, that's the difference between a boy like Kevin

Oh, you calling me crazy?

1319
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:34,956
I don't know.
If the shoe fits, then wear it.

1320
01:06:34,958 --> 01:06:36,691
So if you can't handle what's going on in here,

1321
01:06:36,693 --> 01:06:39,160
I'm saying you're the one who's leaving, not me.

1322
01:06:39,162 --> 01:06:40,161
You're fired.

1323
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:41,762
What the hell is going on in here?

1324
01:06:41,764 --> 01:06:43,497
Huh? Look here, Pearl,

1325
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:45,633
I can hear you all the way downstairs.

1326
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:47,201
Roscoe, she's fired!
Who's fired?

1327
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:48,669
Momma, you ain't got to be like that.

1328
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:51,005
Are you on medication?
You need to be quiet,

1329
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,773
because you ain't no better than
nobody else, not tipping out.

1330
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:55,209
I think all y'all bitches are stealing.

1331
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,878
Kelly, Pearl, I can't have this confusion back here.

1332
01:06:57,880 --> 01:06:59,180
Now, Momma Pearl, look here.

1333
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:01,515
You ain't got authority to fire nobody.

1334
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,817
Okay? And at least not her.

1335
01:07:02,819 --> 01:07:04,452
She been here so long she got tenure.

1336
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:06,220
Forget it, Roscoe. You know
what? I'm tired of this.

1337
01:07:06,222 --> 01:07:07,722
You want your little thousand dollars?

1338
01:07:07,724 --> 01:07:09,056
You take your little thousand dollars.

1339
01:07:09,058 --> 01:07:10,491
I'm going to go out there and strut my ass,

1340
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,060
and make twice that amount.

1341
01:07:13,062 --> 01:07:15,062
ROSCOE: All right, look, that's
enough of this bullshit.

1342
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,864
I want all y'all
back on the floor. Now!

1343
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,306
WOMAN: Oh!

1344
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:21,402
Oh, oh, oh.

1345
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:24,205
And you best mind your business, Baby Girl.

1346
01:07:25,675 --> 01:07:27,108
EMCEE:
Up next on the main stage...

1347
01:07:27,110 --> 01:07:29,310
PEARL: I don't like that girl,

1348
01:07:29,312 --> 01:07:31,946
thinking she's better than everybody else, try to be me.

1349
01:07:31,948 --> 01:07:34,782
Yeah. She's trying to steal
all our money.

1350
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:37,451
All up in Chicago's face, man.

1351
01:07:37,453 --> 01:07:39,320
PEARL: Mm-hmm. I know.

1352
01:07:39,322 --> 01:07:41,856
I see everything that goes on around here.

1353
01:07:41,858 --> 01:07:45,893
LEXUS: She's fucking up our
chances of getting out of here.

1354
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,629
You want her out?

1355
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,031
Most definitely.

1356
01:07:50,033 --> 01:07:52,233
I'm going to block her.

1357
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,804
What are you going to do?

1358
01:07:56,806 --> 01:07:59,373
Don't even worry about that.

1359
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:04,011
Billie came by the hospital today.

1360
01:08:04,013 --> 01:08:05,680
Oh, yeah?
Did you give her the money

1361
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:07,214
for Daddy's new specialist?

1362
01:08:07,216 --> 01:08:08,849
I did.

1363
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,489
Oh, and, um, Brandy called.

1364
01:08:15,491 --> 01:08:17,391
We had a really nice talk.

1365
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,193
Yeah?

1366
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:20,461
She wanted to know

1367
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:23,330
if those were Jimmy Choo's or Louboutins

1368
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:25,700
that you wore to the wrap party last weekend.

1369
01:08:35,244 --> 01:08:37,311
Oh...

1370
01:08:37,313 --> 01:08:39,213
Uh... how...?

1371
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,415
How did...?
What did you tell her?

1372
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:44,819
What did I tell her?

1373
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:47,755
That's what you're going to ask me,

1374
01:08:47,757 --> 01:08:49,423
is what did I tell her?

1375
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:51,292
When were you going
to tell me you went to L.A.

1376
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:52,393
with one of your johns,

1377
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:54,195
or were... Were you ever
going to tell me?

1378
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:56,530
Is that that fucking Chicago guy?

1379
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:57,932
Kevin, lower your voice.

1380
01:08:57,934 --> 01:08:59,366
No, I'm not going to lower my fucking voice.

1381
01:08:59,368 --> 01:09:00,634
Kevin, lower your voice.

1382
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,136
I refuse to have this conversation

1383
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,771
in the middle of a diner.

1384
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,473
Jesus.

1385
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:08,309
You refuse a lot of things these days.

1386
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:10,644
You already refused

1387
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:11,979
to read my script,

1388
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:15,416
and you refused to have sex with me.

1389
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:24,592
Why don't you go and have your
boyfriend pick you up tonight.

1390
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:27,128
Kevin, you know nothing happened.

1391
01:09:27,130 --> 01:09:29,597
Kevin, stop.
You know nothing happened.

1392
01:09:29,599 --> 01:09:31,999
I swear to you.

1393
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,269
I did it for the money.

Thank you for picking me up.

Yeah, girl. Of course. What's...

1426
01:11:12,401 --> 01:11:13,400
What's going on?

1427
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:17,371
Kevin found out
Chicago took me to L.A.

1428
01:11:17,373 --> 01:11:20,641
and really blowing up my phone.

1429
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,943
I mean, Kevin was so pissed.

1430
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,778
He just left me here.

1431
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,047
Monica, don't do this to yourself.

1432
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:32,253
You know, I thought I was in control.

1433
01:11:32,255 --> 01:11:34,889
I wasn't.

1434
01:11:36,826 --> 01:11:38,692
I thought there would be no consequences

1435
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:40,661
with all this money.

1436
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:42,496
Sure was right.

1437
01:11:44,734 --> 01:11:47,501
Well... Just got sucked in.

1438
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:50,037
(Sighing)

1439
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,173
I haven't seen my dad in over a week.

1440
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:55,209
I barely look him in the eye.

1441
01:11:57,346 --> 01:12:00,981
Why does it always end so fucked up?

1442
01:12:02,919 --> 01:12:05,352
Here's a question.

1443
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:10,424
You still love Kevin?

1444
01:12:11,961 --> 01:12:14,461
I never stopped.

1445
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:18,399
Well, there you go.
Got your answer.

1446
01:12:19,735 --> 01:12:22,603
Girl, I need to find him.

1447
01:12:22,605 --> 01:12:25,339
We got to work this out.

1448
01:12:41,791 --> 01:12:44,124
Well, hello, lovebirds.

1449
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:46,694
Lexus, it's not what it looks like.

1450
01:12:46,696 --> 01:12:48,295
Relax.

1451
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:50,764
You see, Jade Lee and I have an open relationship.

1452
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,067
Just like you and Monica.

1453
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:56,804
You see, you got a certain thing

1454
01:12:56,806 --> 01:12:58,472
that I can't give Jade Lee.

1455
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:02,176
Although I'm not sure what Chicago could give Monica

1456
01:13:02,178 --> 01:13:03,644
that you can't,

1457
01:13:03,646 --> 01:13:05,179
by the looks of things.

1458
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:07,348
He doesn't give her that.

1459
01:13:07,350 --> 01:13:10,451
Whores only love money.
Everything else is just an act.

1460
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:12,987
Lexi.

1461
01:13:22,865 --> 01:13:24,164
Hey.

1462
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:26,667
Where have you been?
I was worried.

1463
01:13:26,669 --> 01:13:29,370
Welcome to my world, you fucking whore.

1464
01:13:31,741 --> 01:13:33,207
Excuse me.

1465
01:13:34,744 --> 01:13:36,243
Kevin.

1466
01:13:38,481 --> 01:13:40,848
Why are you going through my things?

1467
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,449
What are you doing?

1468
01:13:43,619 --> 01:13:46,286
What the fuck is this?
Those aren't mine.

1469
01:13:46,288 --> 01:13:47,921
Those aren't mine!
What the fuck is this?

1470
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:50,090
Stupid bitch.

1471
01:13:52,194 --> 01:13:54,594
All the surprises you got?

1472
01:13:55,798 --> 01:13:58,532
That's not mine either.

1473
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,968
Kevin, the only time I've ever done X

1474
01:14:00,970 --> 01:14:03,237
was that one time with you.

1475
01:14:06,742 --> 01:14:08,242
Wait...

1476
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,378
What are you doing?

1477
01:14:15,051 --> 01:14:16,884
What does it look like I'm doing?

1478
01:14:16,886 --> 01:14:20,320
I can't believe I was walking around guilty.

1479
01:14:21,724 --> 01:14:23,223
Guilty?

1480
01:14:24,493 --> 01:14:25,759
For what?

1481
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,261
I fucked Jade Lee.

1482
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:30,197
I fucked the shit out of Jade Lee last night.

1483
01:14:30,199 --> 01:14:31,698
We both got jungle fever.

1484
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:35,069
I never cheated on you, you asshole.

1485
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:37,671
At least I can admit what I did.

1486
01:14:39,208 --> 01:14:40,541
If you're going to have sex,

1487
01:14:40,543 --> 01:14:42,242
you might as well get something out of it.

1488
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:43,744
Ain't that right?

1489
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:51,485
You really don't know me at all, do you?

1490
01:14:52,955 --> 01:14:54,488
Kevin!

1491
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,835
The woman that I loved was a good girl.

1492
01:15:09,371 --> 01:15:12,406
She loved her family and she loved herself.

1493
01:15:12,408 --> 01:15:14,741
You're just a cheap trick.

1494
01:15:23,119 --> 01:15:24,985
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1495
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:26,653
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

1496
01:15:26,655 --> 01:15:28,288
(Crying)

1497
01:15:31,927 --> 01:15:33,594
I'm gone.

1498
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:37,364
Good. Leave.

1499
01:15:37,366 --> 01:15:40,200
I'll tell you right now,

1500
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:43,403
Chicago's twice the man you'll ever be.

1501
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:45,305
You're never going to do anything

1502
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,641
with those shitty stories.

1503
01:15:51,347 --> 01:15:53,247
(Ring clacking on floor)

1504
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,987
It's probably for the best.

1505
01:15:59,989 --> 01:16:02,456
Acting, stripping.

1506
01:16:03,726 --> 01:16:07,027
You were always just an attention whore.

1507
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:12,666
(Sniffling)

1508
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:14,434
(Sobbing)

1509
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,579
Monica, you're late.

1510
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:28,282
I was starting to think you quit.

1511
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,819
What's wrong with you?

1512
01:16:40,196 --> 01:16:43,463
(Sultry techno music)

1513
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:58,278
(Jade Lee giggling)

1514
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:01,181
Bitch, what the fuck?

1515
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:03,717
You're planting shit in my purse and in Kevin's head?

1516
01:17:03,719 --> 01:17:06,420
What the fuck are you talking about, bitch?

1517
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:09,056
(Both screaming)
JADE LEE: Get off me!

1518
01:17:09,058 --> 01:17:10,857
(Police siren blaring)

1519
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:35,515
(Cell phone ringing)

1520
01:17:37,186 --> 01:17:39,253
Hello?

1521
01:17:39,255 --> 01:17:41,788
Yeah, we'll accept the charges.

1522
01:17:41,790 --> 01:17:43,390
It's Monica.

1523
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,696
Where are you?

1524
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:52,466
All right.

1525
01:17:52,468 --> 01:17:55,068
(Phone beeping off)
What happened?

1526
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:58,305
Fucking bitches, man.
Fighting in the club.

1527
01:17:58,307 --> 01:17:59,840
Going to go get her?

1528
01:17:59,842 --> 01:18:01,475
Hell, no.

1529
01:18:01,477 --> 01:18:04,378
Let her ass sit in there for a minute.

1530
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:05,946
Let me tell you something, Black.

1531
01:18:05,948 --> 01:18:07,914
The minute you go running after a woman

1532
01:18:07,916 --> 01:18:10,183
is the minute you lose all your power.

1533
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,452
Oh, man, I know that.

1534
01:18:12,454 --> 01:18:14,121
Everything I do, every move I make

1535
01:18:14,123 --> 01:18:17,591
is situated so I don't have
to jump when people want me to.

1536
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:19,559
It's about outsmarting

1537
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:21,895
the man or woman next to you.

1538
01:18:21,897 --> 01:18:25,599
Making them think they got
a choice when they really don't.

1539
01:18:30,205 --> 01:18:31,571
Checkmate.

1540
01:18:31,573 --> 01:18:34,241
My feet always hurt at the end of the day.

1541
01:18:34,243 --> 01:18:36,410
Trudy, is Monica here?

1542
01:18:36,412 --> 01:18:39,112
She went to jail for fighting.

1543
01:18:39,114 --> 01:18:40,614
She went to jail for fighting?

1544
01:18:40,616 --> 01:18:42,382
Yeah.
Goddamn. Thank you, Trudy.

1545
01:18:42,384 --> 01:18:44,818
Good luck! Thank you, Trudy.

1546
01:18:45,988 --> 01:18:48,722
I can't stand him.
He always orders water.

1547
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:57,364
Monica!

1548
01:18:57,366 --> 01:18:59,599
(Laughing)

1549
01:18:59,601 --> 01:19:01,034
Monica!

1550
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:18,518
Thanks for getting me out.

1551
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:20,087
No problem.

1552
01:19:21,223 --> 01:19:22,622
I'm sorry.

1553
01:19:22,624 --> 01:19:25,058
So, what are you going to do?

1554
01:19:26,862 --> 01:19:28,929
About what?

1555
01:19:28,931 --> 01:19:30,163
Monica, I like you.

1556
01:19:30,165 --> 01:19:31,832
I really do.

1557
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:33,467
But I can't keep sitting around

1558
01:19:33,469 --> 01:19:36,536
while you chasing some broke fool all around town.

1559
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:39,773
I'm laying it on the line here.

1560
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,309
But you got to make a choice.

1561
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:43,610
It's either him or me.

1562
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:47,147
He's gone. He left.

1563
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,815
Listen...

1564
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:53,019
I got to go to L.A.
on business.

1565
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,857
My birthday is in three days.

1566
01:19:58,460 --> 01:19:59,926

Beverly Hills or Bel Air is fine.

The opera? Oh, you know what?
We should go to a Lakers game.

No. Why?

01:24:38,674 --> 01:24:40,373
Things got so screwed up.

1646
01:24:42,277 --> 01:24:43,943
Julie...

1647
01:24:45,480 --> 01:24:47,280
did I do something?

1648
01:24:48,817 --> 01:24:51,257
I just thought you were here for me.

Where is Chicago?

1653
01:25:17,312 --> 01:25:20,480
I've been here for hours waiting for him.

1654
01:25:20,482 --> 01:25:22,716
Whatever.

A manicure is $60.

But the sign says...

1714
01:29:49,718 --> 01:29:52,278
I don't give a damn what the sign says.

Ow.

Monica.

1717
01:30:15,844 --> 01:30:17,043
What?

1718
01:30:17,045 --> 01:30:20,246
Look, I just want to apologize.

1719
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,315
You did what you did.

1720
01:30:22,317 --> 01:30:25,084
And it's over.

1721
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:27,553
How'd you find me?
I ran into Tasha.

1722
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:31,057
Look, I just want you to know it wasn't me.

1723
01:30:31,059 --> 01:30:32,692
I don't know what you mean.

1724
01:30:32,694 --> 01:30:34,827
It was Lexus

1725
01:30:34,829 --> 01:30:37,563
who put the condoms and the ecstasy in your purse.

1726
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:40,533
I didn't even know anything about it.

1727
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:42,268
Where is she now?

1728
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:44,470
She's in Vegas.

1729
01:30:44,472 --> 01:30:47,940
Chicago promised her some lounge act.

1730
01:30:47,942 --> 01:30:50,502
But we all know how that goes.

1731
01:30:53,882 --> 01:30:55,314
I just, um...

1732
01:30:55,316 --> 01:30:57,483
I just thought you should know.

1733
01:30:57,485 --> 01:31:01,054
None of it really matters anyways.

1734
01:31:01,056 --> 01:31:02,622
It does matter.

1735
01:31:02,624 --> 01:31:05,291
You loved him once.

1736
01:31:05,293 --> 01:31:07,760
Girl, and I know that he still loves you.

1737
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:12,298
Have you talked to him?

1738
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,034
No, not since that night.

1739
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:18,071
You know where he is?

1740
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:21,607
No. And why do you
want to know?

1741
01:31:21,609 --> 01:31:23,409
Because I know where he's at.

1742
01:31:23,411 --> 01:31:25,478
Do you?
You know what? You're done.

1745
01:31:28,049 --> 01:31:30,116
And what about my other hand?

1746
01:31:30,118 --> 01:31:31,484
You're done.

1747
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,253
Jade Lee, whose baby is it?

01:31:38,259 --> 01:31:41,260
Don't you know strippers never tell the truth?

1750
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:43,296
Hey, were you telling the truth

1751
01:31:43,298 --> 01:31:45,198
when you told Kevin that you never feel anything

1752
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:46,866
during a lap dance?

1753
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:50,837
Or how about that his writing is shitty?

1754
01:31:52,774 --> 01:31:55,441
Were you telling the truth when you told him

1755
01:31:55,443 --> 01:31:58,144
that Chicago is twice the man he was?

1756
01:31:58,146 --> 01:32:00,780
The truth is,

1757
01:32:00,782 --> 01:32:02,515
you still need him.

1758
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:05,318
And I know he still needs you.

1759
01:32:07,188 --> 01:32:09,322

1760
01:32:10,825 --> 01:32:12,625

I...

1794

But I thought you were in L.A.

1795

You're in Houston?

1797

Just told the producers,
"Tax incentives."

1798

We never really needed it...

Someone heard that I, uh...

1805
01:35:12,340 --> 01:35:14,307
sold my script.

1806
01:35:14,309 --> 01:35:17,543
Oh, my God.
This is your script?

1807
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:22,181
That is the best news.

1808
01:35:22,183 --> 01:35:23,015
