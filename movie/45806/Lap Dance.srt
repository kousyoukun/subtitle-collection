13
00:00:54,355 --> 00:00:56,488
Yeah, hey. We're, uh...

14
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:59,191
we're still about
eight hours outside Houston.

<i>Are y'all driving
straight through?</i>

16
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,663
Yeah, we're going to stop,

17
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:06,465
maybe grab a bite,
clean up a bit and then,

18
00:01:06,467 --> 00:01:08,033
you know, we'll see my dad,

19
00:01:08,035 --> 00:01:09,535
we'll spend a night or two
there,

20
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,503
and then we'll be in L.A.
by the end of the week.

00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,612

He's helping me with my lines.

00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:45,504
He's the best

Call Billie.

70
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,216
Aunt Billie?

71
00:04:44,218 --> 00:04:46,184
Where's Daddy?

72
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,753
I should have been here
with you.

73
00:04:47,755 --> 00:04:49,621
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,857
I was planning on telling you
when you got here.

75
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,860
And I was coping just fine
till last night.

76
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,096
Billie should have
called me.

77
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,398
This isn't her fault.

78
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,833
This was my decision,
and mine alone.

79
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:06,805
Well, I could have, you know,
been here with you...

80
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:09,207
helping.

81
00:05:09,209 --> 00:05:11,276
What could you have done?

82
00:05:11,278 --> 00:05:13,812
I would have made you
do the chemo.

83
00:05:13,814 --> 00:05:16,281
Sweetheart, I taught you never
to give up on your dreams

84
00:05:16,283 --> 00:05:18,984
because you feel obligated
to a man.

85
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,520
And that includes me.

86
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:23,832
We should have at least
discussed it.

87
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,492
There's nothing
they could do.

88
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,630
Dad.

89
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,766
Hey, what's this?

90
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,236
Kevin, come here.

91
00:05:38,238 --> 00:05:39,604
I'm really sorry, sir.

92
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,726
I wanted to wait
to ask you first.

93
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:43,909
Enough of that "sir" stuff.

94
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:47,079
From now on...

95
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:48,780
Oh, my God. Dad!

96
00:05:48,782 --> 00:05:49,981
Dad...

97
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:51,183
Nu-Nurse?

98
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:53,185
Nurse?

99
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,053
Come on.

100
00:05:55,055 --> 00:05:56,355
Whoo!

101
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:58,056
Dad?
I'm okay, honey.

102
00:05:58,058 --> 00:06:00,592
Sit down. I'm okay.

103
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:07,766
Her mama
really liked you, son.

104
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:09,167
Congratulations.

105
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:11,370
Thank you.

106
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,076
We can't leave.

107
00:06:18,078 --> 00:06:19,578
I know.

108
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,614
How long do you think
they'll hold our apartment?

109
00:06:22,616 --> 00:06:26,151
I mean, they have our deposit,
so, uh, you know,

110
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:28,120
maybe a month.

111
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:30,589
What about
your fellowship?

112
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,159
It's unpaid anyway.

113
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,061
You should go.

114
00:06:36,063 --> 00:06:39,030
That's the perfect
opportunity.

115
00:06:39,032 --> 00:06:40,599
I'm not leaving.

116
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,934
But you saved up
all last year

117
00:06:42,936 --> 00:06:45,237
so you could take
that opportunity.

118
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,872
With you.

119
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,674
That's our money.

120
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:51,843
It's for our future.

121
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,812
I love you.

122
00:06:55,215 --> 00:06:57,616
I love you, babe.
Hmm.

123
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,322
Miss Moore?
Yes?

124
00:07:04,324 --> 00:07:07,559
Hi, I'm Dr. Jones, your father's
attending physician.

125
00:07:07,561 --> 00:07:09,060
I missed you
the other day.

126
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:13,765
Um, Dr. Cook,
the hospital administrator,

127
00:07:13,767 --> 00:07:15,867
needs to see you
right away.

128
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,237
Is there a problem?
Well, Monica,

129
00:07:19,239 --> 00:07:23,069
your father's benefits have run
out for his hospital coverage.

130
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:26,111
It would only cover
hospice care.

131
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:28,380
I... I don't understand.

132
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,915
This is an itemized sheet,

133
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:33,285
showing that he's exhausted
his acute care coverage

134
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:34,653
in the hospital.

135
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,021
But we have an excellent
hospice program here.

136
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,290
Of course, it could be costly
for patients

137
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,059
who don't have outside coverage
or assistance, you understand.

138
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:43,028
How much are we talking?

139
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:44,729
Well, it's a considerable
amount.

140
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:46,398
You know,
it depends on factors

141
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,700
like how long he'll be here,
which could be several months.

142
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:51,236
There's also
home hospice care.

143
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:54,239
We could have someone
take care of him at the house.

144
00:07:54,241 --> 00:07:55,507
No.

145
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,709
Monica?
No.

146
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,947
No. If my dad
is dying this way,

147
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:05,584
we are getting him the very best
care until the end.

148
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:08,019
Until the end, Kevin.

149
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:12,190
I have some money saved.

150
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,159
We have some
money saved.

151
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,560
Okay.

152
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,598
We have to come up with...

153
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:24,336
$15,000,

154
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:25,971
which has to be paid at once.

155
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:28,273
And then, of course,
there's next month's billing.

156
00:08:28,275 --> 00:08:29,641
15,000?

157
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,610
It's all right there, Monica.

158
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,312
And I wish I could pay
half of it.

159
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,881
Not a fun part
of my job.

160
00:08:35,883 --> 00:08:37,516
But the facts
are the facts,

161
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:40,051
so we have
to figure it out.

162
00:08:41,455 --> 00:08:43,822
Okay. Uh, not a problem.

163
00:08:43,824 --> 00:08:47,826
We'll have the cheque for you
in the morning.

164
00:08:49,162 --> 00:08:51,229
Let's go.

165
00:08:56,303 --> 00:08:58,336
You said...

166
00:08:58,338 --> 00:09:01,306
It's our money. I know.

167
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,075
$15,000.

168
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,779
That's half
of our savings.

169
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,050
It's okay.

170
00:09:13,587 --> 00:09:15,654
I'm selling my car.

171
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,123
I'm paying you back.

172
00:09:18,125 --> 00:09:20,692
I promise.

173
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:25,096
Well, who's that
handsome fella?

174
00:09:25,098 --> 00:09:26,731
Is that my Kevin?

175
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,833
Hey, Billie.
Hi.

176
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,703
How you holding up?

177
00:09:31,705 --> 00:09:33,705
It that your famous
tuna casserole?

178
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:35,507
You know it.
Well, then I'd say things

179
00:09:35,509 --> 00:09:37,876
just got considerably better.

180
00:09:37,878 --> 00:09:40,679
Let me bring you to Monica.
Okay.

181
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,186
I'm going to go
check on Dad.

182
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,555
The tuna casserole
was terrific.

183
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:51,790
Thanks, darling.

184
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,792
Be there in a bit.

185
00:10:03,337 --> 00:10:05,637
This is going to take
everything we have.

186
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,238
And then some.

187
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:14,613
We need to get him
the best treatment there is.

188
00:10:14,615 --> 00:10:16,948
I don't care
what I have to do.

189
00:10:19,853 --> 00:10:21,753
Don't you think
I love my brother enough

190
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,655
to make that happen?

191
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,127
You were in junior high
when your mother got sick.

192
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,695
I was the one there,

193
00:10:30,697 --> 00:10:33,999
helping your dad
make all the hard decisions.

194
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,202
In his first bout
with cancer,

195
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:39,170
I was the one that was
cleaning bedpans

196
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:40,372
and helping raise you.

197
00:10:40,374 --> 00:10:41,773
So don't come around here

198
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,908
spending money you know
you don't have,

199
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,610
like you're the only one
that gives a damn.

200
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:53,051
Look...

201
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:54,953
sweetie.

202
00:10:57,791 --> 00:11:00,325
You've got Kevin
to think of too.

203
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:03,795
I mean, he has put
his entire life on hold

204
00:11:03,797 --> 00:11:07,432
to stay in Tallahassee
so that you can finish school.

205
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,934
And he is doing it again.

206
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,737
For you and your father.

207
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,739
That is a good man.

208
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:22,380
As hard as you're fighting
for your father,

209
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:26,451
you need to protect
your relationship too.

210
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,425
Monica Moore?

211
00:11:33,427 --> 00:11:34,993
Tasha?

212
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,194
Yes.

213
00:11:36,196 --> 00:11:38,563
Hi.
Hey.

214
00:11:38,565 --> 00:11:39,764
Mwah. Oh!

215
00:11:39,766 --> 00:11:41,933
You look amazing.

216
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,169
I hardly recognize you.

217
00:11:44,171 --> 00:11:47,405
I mean, I'd ask how you are,
but obviously you're doing well.

218
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:49,040
I am.

219
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,076
Okay, so tell me,
what is new

220
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:53,912
with HSPDAs favourite
Ophelia, huh?

221
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,480
You still at FSU?

222
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:57,882
I was.
I just graduated.

223
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,685
Big part?

224
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,054
Oh, this.
My fiancé, Kevin,

225
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,524
he... It's one of his scripts.
He's a screenwriter.

226
00:12:06,526 --> 00:12:09,294
Cool. The dynamic duo
or something?

227
00:12:09,296 --> 00:12:10,795
Okay, so why y'all
in Houston?

228
00:12:10,797 --> 00:12:12,630
Ah, ah, ah, ah. Monica.

229
00:12:12,632 --> 00:12:15,433
Stop talking.

230
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,335
Get back to work.

231
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,405
You work here?

232
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,175
Mani or pedi?

233
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:30,115
This ain't right.

234
00:12:30,117 --> 00:12:31,883
Come on, tell me, girl.
What's going on?

235
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:33,451
Dad's sick.

236
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:36,087
Kevin and I actually thought
we were on our way to L.A.

237
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,655
and just passing through.

238
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:40,525
Oh, my... He's been sick
since high school, huh?

239
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:43,261
I'm so sorry.
Thanks.

240
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,830
I mean, you know,
it's a rough time for sure.

241
00:12:45,832 --> 00:12:48,700
There aren't many gigs
in Houston

242
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:50,869
for a highly educated actress.

243
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,670
I mean, Aunt Billie
got me this job here,

244
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:57,809
but it barely scratches
the surface of Daddy's bills.

245
00:12:57,811 --> 00:12:59,110
You ever thought
about dancing?

246
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:00,779
I've been working

247
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,080
over at Hidden Treasures
for a while now.

248
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,615
I could talk to my boss
for you.

249
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,919
Uh, I don't know that Kevin
would ever let me strip.

250
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,155
Why not? Y'all can make
quick money?

251
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:12,824
Take care of you
and your dad's medical bills.

252
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:15,960
I don't know.
It sounds kind of dirty,

253
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,663
showing my vajayjay
to a bunch of perverts.

254
00:13:18,665 --> 00:13:19,898
No offence.

255
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,866
Your vajayjay.

256
00:13:21,868 --> 00:13:24,269
It's a topless bar only, okay?

257
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,970
The clientele,
they're not some hood rats.

258
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:29,207
They're businessmen.
They're executives.

259
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:30,675
Contractors.

260
00:13:30,677 --> 00:13:32,277
Seriously,
it pays the bills.

261
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,846
Takes care of my rent,
my tuition.

262
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:37,015
Fills my refrigerator.

263
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:39,484
Doesn't even include
the perks.

264
00:13:41,922 --> 00:13:44,689
Whatever.
It's not for everyone.

265
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,659
Think about it.

266
00:13:47,661 --> 00:13:49,494
Okay?

267
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,728
Okay.

268
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,030
Thank you.

269
00:13:52,032 --> 00:13:53,932
See you, girl!

270
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:03,374
Girl, see what
hard work does?

271
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,676
Pays off well.

272
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:07,011
Hard work, good tips.

273
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:26,998
What am I thinking?

274
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,238
Monica.

275
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,505
Shit.

276
00:14:34,507 --> 00:14:35,807
Monica Moore.

277
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:37,375
Hey, girl.

278
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,043
Hey!
Hi.

279
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:40,812
What's going on?

280
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:42,213
Change your mind?

281
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,782
No, I stopped by
to return the tip.

282
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,251
It was too much.

283
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,353
Come on,
it's not pity money.

284
00:14:48,355 --> 00:14:51,256
Just helping
a girlfriend out.

285
00:14:51,258 --> 00:14:52,924
Seriously, want to come in?

286
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:55,260
I got a bus to catch.

287
00:14:55,262 --> 00:14:56,561
Really?

288
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,897
Come on, I'll give you
a ride home. Check it out.

289
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,299
Okay.
Okay.

290
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,803
I usually work nights,

291
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:07,105
but I just have to pick
something up.

292
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,773
You want a drink?

293
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,943
Okay, give me just a minute.

294
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,354
Two for one drinks till Friday night now.

295
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,989
♪ Take it to the ground ♪

296
00:15:24,991 --> 00:15:26,724

00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,730

300
00:15:32,732 --> 00:15:34,866

♪ What's my name again? ♪

302
00:15:36,803 --> 00:15:38,002
Only a thousand
this time?

303
00:15:39,205 --> 00:15:40,872
Just kidding, sweetie.

304
00:15:40,874 --> 00:15:44,609
Don't forget now, I'm only
working nights next week.

305
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,079
Okay, you ready to go?

306
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,452
What's wrong?

307
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,020
I hate the smell
of nail polish.

308
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:03,227
Is it hard,
dancing for those strange men?

309
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,663
Maybe the first time.
But that's it.

310
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:07,965
I mean, after that it's,
you know...

311
00:16:11,137 --> 00:16:12,870
What is wrong
with you?

312
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:17,141
My daddy's latest bill
just came in the mail yesterday.

313
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:22,880
You really make all that money
by dancing on stage?

314
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:25,049
Sort of.

315
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:30,121
Brandy booked
that<i> CSI</i> pilot.

316
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,490
I know I would
have gotten that gig.

317
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,058
You would have.

318
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,299
Sandra said Brandy
screwed the casting director.

319
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:42,700
I mean, at least if you're
going to have sex,

320
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:45,702
you might as well get something
out of it, right?

321
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,309
Where is this coming from?

322
00:16:51,311 --> 00:16:52,643
God, I just miss performing.

323
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:54,912
I mean, at least you can
still write,

324
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,781
even in the midst
of all this.

325
00:16:56,783 --> 00:16:58,716
Why are you being
like this?

326
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:00,952
I'm just thinking
about Daddy's bills.

327
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:02,653
Well, when I sell my script,

328
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:05,256
we're going to have
all the money we ever needed.

329
00:17:05,258 --> 00:17:07,792
But we need money now.

330
00:17:13,466 --> 00:17:15,099
I...

331
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:19,103
I think I could
make money dancing.

332
00:17:20,206 --> 00:17:21,706
With a dance company?

333
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,274
No.

334
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:25,543
Tasha showed me around
the club that she works at.

335
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,311
You know...

336
00:17:27,313 --> 00:17:30,014
I mean, at first
it seemed strange.

337
00:17:30,016 --> 00:17:32,483
I was like,
Can this be legal?

338
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,787
But...

339
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:40,058
after a few minutes, I mean,
it all seemed pretty normal.

340
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:43,594
You went to a strip club?

341
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:46,597
I saw a guy just give a chick
$300.

342
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,233
And Tasha said
on the night shift

343
00:17:49,235 --> 00:17:52,703
that you can make
up to $700 or more a night.

344
00:17:52,705 --> 00:17:55,006
I mean, I figure if I danced
every day,

345
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:57,208
I could make back our 30 grand
in less than two months,

346
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:59,510
and pay Daddy's bills,
and then maybe even

347
00:17:59,512 --> 00:18:01,879
swing a few flights out to L.A.
for auditions.

348
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,115
Or for you to take
meetings.

349
00:18:06,619 --> 00:18:09,520
Just until things get settled
with Daddy.

350
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:13,424
And then we'll move out,
you know, as planned.

363
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:18,923
Light are off.

364
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:27,765
Kevin...

365
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,500
Yeah?

366
00:19:29,502 --> 00:19:32,537
I've been thinking
about the club.

367
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:36,874
I mean, it's not that much
different than acting.

368
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:39,777
It's just playing a role.

369
00:19:42,582 --> 00:19:45,882
I went topless in two
of your student films, remember?

370
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:50,855
Besides, it's quick money.

371
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,227
I know this guy at work.

372
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:58,429
He sells weed on the side.

373
00:19:58,431 --> 00:20:00,398
Quick legal money.

374
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,600
I'm about to lose
my Dad.

375
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,735
What would I do
if you got shot

376
00:20:04,737 --> 00:20:06,671
or landed in jail?

377
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:08,706
It's not going to happen.
It's just weed.

378
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:13,644
No. Dancing is the only way
to make money fast.

379
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:14,946
And you know it.

380
00:20:14,948 --> 00:20:17,582
This isn't just about Daddy.
This is about us.

381
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:21,252
If we get stuck here,
we'll never leave.

382
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:30,761
We can try it
for a week.

383
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,869
I promised your dad

384
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,838
I wouldn't let you
give up on your dreams

385
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:44,041
and while I'm making progress,
you're saving.

386
00:20:44,043 --> 00:20:49,247
And besides, I always wanted
sexy lap dance from my baby.

387
00:20:49,249 --> 00:20:50,514
Okay.

388
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:53,618
There's got to be
some rules now.

389
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:55,653
Okay.

390
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,760
There's no dancing at that club
if I'm not there.

391
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,863
What if you're at work?
We'll figure it out.

392
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07,565
I'll be there to walk you
to and from the car,

393
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:09,233
otherwise it's just not safe.

394
00:21:09,235 --> 00:21:10,801
Okay.

395
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:14,639
And as soon as I've made
enough money, we're out.

396
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:17,508
Number two, there's no drinking
at that club, all right?

397
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,343
Stay sharp. It's just work.

398
00:21:20,313 --> 00:21:21,512
Number three:

399
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:24,415
No outside parties,

400
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:26,117
- VIP.
- Ew.

401
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:29,453
You think I want some creep
to finger-bang me?

402
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:32,723
No, just...

403
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:34,685
just stage
and lap dances only.

404
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,164
Number four: We don't see
anybody from the club

405
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:41,699
outside the club.

406
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:45,069
And number five:

407
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,671
No drugs.

408
00:21:46,673 --> 00:21:50,308
You are the one
that smokes weed.

409
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,942
I do smoke weed.

410
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,680
And lastly...

411
00:21:55,682 --> 00:21:59,450
no turning me down
when I want some good loving.

412
00:22:00,853 --> 00:22:02,320
Okay.

413
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:04,455
And that last rule
starts right now.

414
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:07,892
Thank you for being
so open-minded

415
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:10,428
and wanting to try this.

416
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,730
And I promise

417
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:17,768
you'll get plenty
of good love-making.

418
00:22:19,072 --> 00:22:21,038
I better get that.

Uh, no, no. I'm good.
We're good. Sorry.

434
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:20,231
Still no answer?
No.

435
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,500
So, what? If he doesn't show
you're just not going to dance?

436
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:23,701
I promised him I wouldn't.

437
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:26,103
Hmm. Good luck with that.

438
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,905
What does that mean?

439
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:30,875
Girl, having your man sit
in the club while you dancing?

440
00:23:30,877 --> 00:23:34,145
That's going to throw you
off your game.

441
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:36,680
Going to put you
on Matt E.'s bad list.

442
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,083
Cost you a high roller.

443
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:40,818
High roller?

444
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,653
We got a regular client,
well off.

445
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,722
You know,
they're a high score.

446
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:47,992
You see my girl out there
on stage, Lexus?

447
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:50,327
She is a top moneymaker.

448
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,695
She got Chicago, girl.

449
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:54,965
The finest man in the city.

450
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:57,902
Baby Girl,
you're up in 10.

451
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:00,871
And you'd better tip out
when you dance here.

452
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:05,075
What's her problem?

453
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,510
She just mad
because she can't work

454
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:08,312
that pole no more.

455
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:11,449
So, you going on?

456
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,088
Um...

457
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,557
I... I apologize.

458
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:21,192
You know,
I need 30 seconds.

459
00:24:21,194 --> 00:24:22,726
Go ahead.

460
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:26,564
Uh, hey, babe.
Babe, where are you?

461
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:28,566
The meeting just started
20 minutes ago.

462
00:24:28,568 --> 00:24:29,967
Did you get the job?

463
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,735
Um, I don't know.

464
00:24:31,737 --> 00:24:33,370
He's just looking
at the storyboards.

465
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:37,308
Well, I'm on in 10 minutes.
What do you want me to do?

466
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,943
<i>Kevin,</i>

467
00:24:38,945 --> 00:24:40,845
we've been working up for this
the past two weeks.

468
00:24:40,847 --> 00:24:42,780
If I chicken out,
they'll fire me.

469
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,348
Uh...

470
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,883
you know, just...

471
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:47,651
Just do it.

472
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,153
I'll get there when I can.

473
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:50,921
Are you sure?

474
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,990
Yeah.

475
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,226
Okay. I got to go.

476
00:24:55,228 --> 00:24:57,228
Monica?
What?

477
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,697
I love you.
Okay, bye.

478
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,037
♪ Yeah ♪

479
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,240
♪ Ah ♪

480
00:25:11,511 --> 00:25:13,110
Monica?

481
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:16,347
Monica Moore?

482
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,148
No.

483
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:20,251
Sherry. My name is Sherry.

484
00:25:20,253 --> 00:25:21,585
Oh.

485
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:23,954
How long you been
dancing here, Sherry?

486
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,756
Since tonight.

487
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:28,993
That's crazy. You look exactly
like this girl

488
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:32,265
I went to junior high with.
I had a huge crush on her.

489
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,299
I want five songs.

490
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:39,570
They're 20 each.
That's like $100.

491
00:25:39,572 --> 00:25:42,006
I know how much they are.

492
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,888
What...?

493
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,523
Wait. You can't do that.

494
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,724
What the fuck are you doing?

495
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,526
What's going on?

496
00:26:02,528 --> 00:26:04,295
I want my money back.
What are you doing?

497
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:06,030
He had his hands all over me.
Can he do that?

498
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:08,599
Uh, can I just steal her away
for a second, boo-boo?

499
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,634
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks, baby.

500
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,903
What are you doing?

501
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,605
He had his hands
all over me.

502
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:18,008
Okay, well, Matt E. let's them
touch anything but the na-na.

503
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,377
Okay? So when you're
on the floor, that fine.

504
00:26:20,379 --> 00:26:21,779
In the VIP...

505
00:26:21,781 --> 00:26:23,314
I don't remember
you telling me that.

506
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:24,715
Well, I did tell you that.

507
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,917
Okay, dancing on the main stage
is okay,

508
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:28,786
but walking the floor
is hustling for lap dances?

509
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,955
Monica, calm down, okay?
I can't do it.

510
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,990
Okay, well,
you're going to have to, okay?

511
00:26:32,992 --> 00:26:35,659
First time, it's the hardest.
After that it's fine.

512
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,795
I told you, okay? Drink this.
What is it?

513
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:39,697
It something
to make you relax.

514
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,966
Drink it. I promise.
Close your eyes.

515
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:43,300
I don't know.
Look and think

516
00:26:43,302 --> 00:26:45,936
that he's like Brad Pitt
or something.

517

Men and smoke.
I got to shower.

Humour me with this.

605
00:31:19,778 --> 00:31:21,311
How is it that
y'all over here

606
00:31:21,313 --> 00:31:24,147
just drinking
my fine liquor

607
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:26,250
and just having a big time,

608
00:31:26,252 --> 00:31:29,953
but ain't one of you
out on the floor making a dime?

609
00:31:29,955 --> 00:31:32,055
How is that possible?

610
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:36,627
Matt, don't I always
tip out?

611
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:37,961
Hmm.

612
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,663
Yes, ma'am. Yes, you do.
Yes.

613

That is... That is a good answer.
That is a good answer.

you're doing yours.

Oh, you know I always
tip out.

618
00:31:52,711 --> 00:31:55,646
I am the club.
You know that.

Me.

624
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,993
That means you're tipping out
to me.

00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:12,195
Ain't no joking
about that.

Hmm.

647
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:57,541
Never.

648
00:32:57,543 --> 00:32:59,876
Oh, it's like that?

649
00:32:59,878 --> 00:33:01,678
What?

650
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,480
I got diabetes anyway.

651
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,916
That's why you only get a 50.
Here.

652
00:33:05,918 --> 00:33:08,885
Mmm, Jade Lee,
my favourite jewel.

653
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:10,620
What's up, baby?
Hi.

654
00:33:10,622 --> 00:33:12,289
Mm-hmm. Say hey.

655
00:33:12,291 --> 00:33:14,124
How are you?
Better now.

656
00:33:14,126 --> 00:33:16,560
Mmm. Look at you.
Yeah.

657
00:33:16,562 --> 00:33:18,662
That's what I'm talking about.
You ready?

658
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:20,364
Yeah.
Absolutely.

659
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,000
Yeah.

660
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,244
Watch yourself
around those guys.

661
00:33:34,246 --> 00:33:36,206
Tasha to the main stage.

662
00:33:37,649 --> 00:33:39,049
Who's the newbie?

663
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,717
That's Monica.

664
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:42,152
She goes by Baby Girl.

665
00:33:42,154 --> 00:33:44,354
Yeah, she's sexy as hell, too.

666
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,823
Get her up here.
I want to meet her.

667
00:33:46,825 --> 00:33:48,792
She don't work the VIP.

668
00:33:56,335 --> 00:33:58,301
Someone in VIP
wants to meet you.

669
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,636
He's a movie director.

670
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,104
Told him you wanted
to be an actress.

671
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:03,373
Seriously?

672
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,542
Babe, you can show him
your screenplays.

673
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,711
Oh, no. Just...
Just you.

674
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,112
Oh.

675
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:10,714
I'll keep him company.

676
00:34:10,716 --> 00:34:12,849
Okay.

677
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:14,351
It's okay.

678
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:16,520
I know we said no VIP.
This could be your big break.

679
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,889
Whatever gets us
out of here faster.

680
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,090
You sure?

681
00:34:20,092 --> 00:34:22,392
Nope.

682
00:34:22,394 --> 00:34:23,627
Mwah.

683
00:34:29,701 --> 00:34:31,768
Hi.
Hi.

684
00:34:42,614 --> 00:34:43,814
Hi.

685
00:34:45,017 --> 00:34:46,817
Meet Monica.

686
00:34:54,626 --> 00:34:57,627
You need anything, boss man?

687
00:34:57,629 --> 00:34:59,529
Yeah. Uh, tell Lexus

688
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:02,199
to bring me a bottle
of Dom Pérignon.

689
00:35:02,201 --> 00:35:03,600
You heard the man.

690
00:35:06,738 --> 00:35:08,405
Sugar. Sugar to the main stage.

691
00:35:08,407 --> 00:35:11,208
And after that, Baby Girl.

692
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:16,480
Sorry about that.
She's crazy.

693
00:35:22,654 --> 00:35:26,056
Uh, Jade Lee told me that
you're in the movie business?

694
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,594
You could say I dabble
a little bit.

695
00:35:30,596 --> 00:35:32,696
I'm an actress.

696
00:35:33,866 --> 00:35:35,465
Really?

697
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:38,101
How come you're not
in Hollywood?

698
00:35:38,103 --> 00:35:40,437
I was actually driving
to Los Angeles,

699
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:44,841
until we discovered
that my dad's cancer relapsed.

700
00:35:44,843 --> 00:35:46,243
Man...

701
00:35:46,245 --> 00:35:48,912
Trying to make money
to care for him.

702
00:35:48,914 --> 00:35:50,814
Sorry to hear that.

703
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:53,750
You should let me
help you out with that.

704
00:36:03,295 --> 00:36:04,794
That's $1,000.

705
00:36:06,198 --> 00:36:08,064
Thank you.

706
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,900
Um...

707
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:11,668
Chicago.

708
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,104
You're Chicago?
You're a director?

709
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,241
Not unless you're talking

710
00:36:18,243 --> 00:36:20,843
about a couple
of horror movies, boo-boo.

711
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,514
Give me a minute.

712
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:28,718
Wait, I just gave you $1,000.

713
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,120
Come on, gentlemen.

714
00:36:30,122 --> 00:36:31,788
Tip your waitresses.

715
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:35,125
Chicago is trying to give me
$1,000 to dance for him.

716
00:36:35,127 --> 00:36:36,826
Isn't he with Lexus?

717
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:38,662
No, everybody's dancing
with Chicago.

718
00:36:38,664 --> 00:36:40,397
Come on, nobody's been offered
that much money, though.

719
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,798
Take it.
Are you sure?

720
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,500
I mean, I can't be making
any enemies.

721
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:46,069
No. Get the money.
Take it. Go.

722
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:47,537
Tasha to the main stage.

723
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:50,707
So, Monica tells me
you're a writer.

724
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:52,509
I am.

725
00:36:54,012 --> 00:36:56,046
So, where were we?

726
00:36:56,048 --> 00:36:57,247
Uh...

727
00:36:57,249 --> 00:36:59,583
you want that dance?

728
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:02,919
So this is your first time
in VIP, huh?

729
00:37:04,223 --> 00:37:05,989
Anything goes up here.

730
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:08,825
Even sex.

731
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:10,427
Well...

732
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,330
you'll have to get Lexus
if that's what you want.

733
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:14,598
Oh, really?

734
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,366
You think that's what
I want?

735
00:37:16,368 --> 00:37:20,103
$1,000 is a lot
of money

736
00:37:20,105 --> 00:37:22,138
just for a dance.

737
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,440
I don't want a dance,
sweetheart.

738
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:24,841
I just want to talk.

739
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,376
Talk?

740
00:37:26,378 --> 00:37:28,845
I think we got off
on the wrong foot.

741
00:37:28,847 --> 00:37:31,081
Let me reintroduce myself
to you.

742
00:37:31,083 --> 00:37:33,917
Hi, my name is Jorge.

743
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:36,219
My friends like to call me
Chicago.

744
00:37:36,221 --> 00:37:37,887
Monica.

745
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,889
My friends call me Mo.

746
00:37:39,891 --> 00:37:41,491
Pleasure.

747
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,663
You've been drinking.

748
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:49,499
I'm pretty sure you just broke
rule number one.

749
00:37:49,501 --> 00:37:52,535
You broke a lot
of rules tonight.

750
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,906
I think we need to re-establish
some guidelines.

751
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:06,750
So how'd you like your first
night stripping in the VIP?

752
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:09,619
I didn't actually strip.
I just talked.

753
00:38:10,989 --> 00:38:14,457
Something you and I
aren't doing a lot of lately.

754
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,159
That's all
I'm doing now.

755
00:38:16,161 --> 00:38:17,794
Just talking.

756
00:38:19,164 --> 00:38:20,764
You like what you do?

757
00:38:20,766 --> 00:38:23,667
You look like you were eating up
all the attention up there.

758
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:26,102
It's just acting to me.

759
00:38:26,104 --> 00:38:30,473
So those guys touching
your breasts and your ass,

760
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:33,443
that's just
method acting, huh?

761
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:36,813
I look like I enjoy it.

762
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,718
The client is happy.

763
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:45,121
They buy more dances,
and we make more money.

764
00:38:45,123 --> 00:38:48,291
Tonight that's all
the client wanted, was talking.

765
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:50,093
Yeah.

766
00:38:50,095 --> 00:38:52,128
That's all.

767
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:54,030
So, who's your new BFF?

768
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:57,100
Chicago.

769
00:38:57,102 --> 00:39:00,670
Well, Jorge, actually.

770
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,605
He wasn't a director,

771
00:39:02,607 --> 00:39:04,607
but I think he owns
a record label.

772
00:39:04,609 --> 00:39:07,811
He gave me $3,000
to help us out.

773
00:39:07,813 --> 00:39:09,579
Just for talking?
Sounds like bullshit.

774
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:13,249
Bullshit? I'm just trying
to make money for my dad and us.

775
00:39:13,251 --> 00:39:16,052
Don't let the money
change you.

- How much longer you here for?
- Uh, we're not sure.

804
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:42,999
We're waiting to find out
what happens with Monica's dad,

805
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:44,534
and then we're going
to head out to L.A.

806
00:41:44,536 --> 00:41:46,002
How about you two?

807
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,504
Boyfriends?

808
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:50,373
No.

809
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:52,842
Ahem, so, um,
what do you write?

810
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,944
I picked up some freelance
copywriting.

811
00:41:54,946 --> 00:41:56,813
And I'm currently working
on a feature,

812
00:41:56,815 --> 00:42:01,084
tentatively titled<i> A Man's Guide
to Understanding Women.</i>

813
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,354
That sounds intriguing.

814
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:06,389
I told him it's going to take
more than one movie

815
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,024
to understand women.

816
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:11,261
You need at least
two sequels.

817
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,531
Thanks for inviting us over.

818
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:17,333
You guys ever roll before?

819
00:42:17,335 --> 00:42:20,003
Roll what?

820
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:23,406
You're so sweet and innocent.

821
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,808
Uh, never taken X before?

822
00:42:26,778 --> 00:42:29,312
I don't really
do any drugs.

823
00:42:30,815 --> 00:42:33,349
Um, I mean,
I've heard of it.

824
00:42:33,351 --> 00:42:34,951
It's harmless, actually.

825
00:42:34,953 --> 00:42:38,421
Just takes your sense of touch
to a whole nother level.

826
00:42:38,423 --> 00:42:39,622
Mm-hmm.

827
00:42:39,624 --> 00:42:41,991
Feels like magic.

828
00:42:43,061 --> 00:42:45,261
You have to try it.
It's so cool.

829
00:42:47,465 --> 00:42:49,299
Oh, but I get it
if you're scared.

830
00:42:51,436 --> 00:42:53,336
I'm not scared.

831
00:42:55,774 --> 00:42:57,173
You want to try it?

832
00:42:57,175 --> 00:42:58,575
If you want to.

833
00:42:59,945 --> 00:43:01,911
Okay.

834
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,254
Let's do it.

835
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:22,832
Okay, Lexus,
truth or dare?

836
00:43:24,102 --> 00:43:25,501
Dare.

837
00:43:27,372 --> 00:43:29,872
I dare you...

838
00:43:30,875 --> 00:43:33,276
to kiss Monica on the lips.

839
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:35,511
Which set of lips?

840
00:43:35,513 --> 00:43:38,514
The mouth, you nasty whore.

00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:07,744
Okay, Jade Lee.

845
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:10,246
Truth or dare?

846
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:12,148
Dare.

847
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:14,751
I dare you...

848
00:44:14,753 --> 00:44:19,122
to give Kevin
a VIP lap dance.

849
00:44:24,596 --> 00:44:26,262
Okay.

850
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,849
How do you feel?

851
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,251
Don't worry, girl.

852
00:44:48,253 --> 00:44:49,452

Two for one dances

867
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:31,020
on Thursday night.

868
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:33,656
Two for one dances
on Thursday night.

869
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:35,191
Come back to Hidden Treasures,

870
00:46:35,193 --> 00:46:37,860
where you get two for one dances
on Thursday night.

871
00:46:37,862 --> 00:46:39,929
Hope to see you then.

872
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,371
Don't forget to tip
your waitresses.

873
00:46:48,373 --> 00:46:50,139
Tip them.

874
00:47:11,362 --> 00:47:13,262
So, listen, listen.

875
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:17,200
When you get off work,

876
00:47:17,202 --> 00:47:19,635
I want you to come over
to my house tonight.

877
00:47:19,637 --> 00:47:22,004
You know I don't
do that.

878
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:26,242
What? Relax.
It's not even like that.

879
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:31,280
I'm having a little
get-together at my place,

880
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:33,482
and I want
all of my friends there.

881
00:47:33,484 --> 00:47:35,284
Just as a party.

882
00:47:36,821 --> 00:47:38,321
Okay.

883
00:47:38,323 --> 00:47:39,922
Sure.

884
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:44,026
But I get your hat.

885
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:46,295
It looks nice on you.

886
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,532
Handsome cash.

887
00:47:49,534 --> 00:47:51,868
You're just taking
all of my money.

888
00:47:56,574 --> 00:47:59,008
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going, baby?

889
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,243
Just going to the VIP, man.

890
00:48:00,245 --> 00:48:02,812
No, no, no.
This is for VIP, not BAP.

891
00:48:02,814 --> 00:48:04,247
That stands
for Broke-Ass People.

892
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:06,182
You want to go upstairs,
you got to have a bottle.

893
00:48:06,184 --> 00:48:08,417
Okay, how much is a bottle?

894
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:10,019
$500.

895
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:12,688
Roscoe, I don't have
500 fucking bucks, man.

896
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:17,026
I know. That's why it's for VIP,
not BAP.

897
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:19,295
Roscoe, that's my fucking
fiancée, okay?

898
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:22,298
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know. I know.

899
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,599
Hey, easy.

900
00:48:23,601 --> 00:48:26,836
Kev, you got to go.

901
00:48:26,838 --> 00:48:28,638
I ain't saying
you got to go home,

902
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,206
but you should go home.

903
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:32,074
For what? What do I have
to go home for?

904
00:48:32,076 --> 00:48:33,676
Causing problems
in my club.

905
00:48:33,678 --> 00:48:35,945
I'm not causing
any problems in your club, man.

906
00:48:35,947 --> 00:48:38,080
Look, I like you,

907
00:48:38,082 --> 00:48:39,749
and I tell
a lot of people that,

908
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:43,619
but I really like you,
and we talked about this before,

909
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:46,956
but dancers that bring
their boyfriends into the club,

910
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:48,691
it just doesn't mix.

911
00:48:48,693 --> 00:48:50,793
It's bad for business.

912
00:48:50,795 --> 00:48:52,295
What's that I always say,
Trudy?

913
00:48:52,297 --> 00:48:54,096
It's fun visiting Disney Land,

914
00:48:54,098 --> 00:48:55,998
but it sure ain't fun
working there.

915
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,634
Your mouth
to God's ears.

916
00:48:58,636 --> 00:49:00,269
Now, look, Kevin,

917
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:03,706
in all my years
in this business,

918
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,107
I've seen everything.

919
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,310
Hell, Roscoe and I
we've done half of them.

920
00:49:07,312 --> 00:49:10,880
But there's one thing,
one thing that never changes.

921
00:49:10,882 --> 00:49:13,015
And that is...

922
00:49:13,017 --> 00:49:16,619
it's the money
that brings the girls in,

923
00:49:16,621 --> 00:49:20,556
but it's the attention
that keeps them coming back.

924
00:49:20,558 --> 00:49:22,925
Now your little baby doll,
your sweet Monica,

925
00:49:22,927 --> 00:49:24,560
she's upstairs right now,

926
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:27,296
and she's had a taste
of this life.

927
00:49:29,033 --> 00:49:31,334
And she ain't coming back.

928
00:49:31,336 --> 00:49:33,836
That's cute,
but you're wrong.

929
00:49:33,838 --> 00:49:36,005
She's not like that.
Sorry.

930
00:49:36,007 --> 00:49:38,541
Well, either you're leaving...

931
00:49:38,543 --> 00:49:40,876
or she is.

932
00:49:40,878 --> 00:49:42,611
It's your choice.

933
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:47,950
Last call for alcohol.

934
00:49:47,952 --> 00:49:49,452
Last call.

935
00:50:04,202 --> 00:50:05,835
And she didn't even have my money.

936
00:50:05,837 --> 00:50:07,737
Where's Chicago, girl?

937
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:10,506
Oh, over there.

938
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:11,707
Looking good, ladies.

939
00:50:11,709 --> 00:50:13,042
Hi. Good to see you.

940
00:50:13,044 --> 00:50:14,543
Don't hurt nobody.

941
00:50:17,615 --> 00:50:19,115
Wow.

942
00:50:22,487 --> 00:50:24,387
He's been waiting
for you.

943
00:50:24,389 --> 00:50:25,688
Yes.

944
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,333
Hey, beautiful.
Hey.

945
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:38,734
Glad you could make it.

946
00:50:38,736 --> 00:50:39,969
Of course.

947
00:50:39,971 --> 00:50:42,038
Your place is fabulous.

948
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,639
Ha-ha.
Thank you, thank you.

949
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:46,042
Come on. Come and meet
some of my friends. Let's go.

950
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,777
What's up?

951
00:50:47,779 --> 00:50:49,745
Oh, man. I'm good, I'm good.
Good to see you, brother.

952
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:50,946
Meet a good friend of mine.

953
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,515
Monica, meet Wesley Jonathan.

954
00:50:52,517 --> 00:50:54,583
Wesley Jonathan,
Monica Moore.

955
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:55,785
Nice to meet you.

956
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:57,153
I own all
of your movies.

957
00:50:57,155 --> 00:50:58,621
Oh, thank you.

958
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:01,891
Yeah, Chicago says, uh,
great things about you.

959
00:51:01,893 --> 00:51:03,159
He does?
Mm-hmm.

960
00:51:03,161 --> 00:51:04,427
And you know the mayor, right?

961
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,961
Mayor Williamson,
meet Monica.

962
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:07,163
The pleasure's all mine.

963
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,131
Thank you.
A friend of mine.

964
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,402
I am so jealous.

965
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,104
Give me a little bit.
A little bit.

966
00:51:15,106 --> 00:51:16,505
Ooh, yeah.

967
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:18,574
And Scipio.

968
00:51:18,576 --> 00:51:20,109
Rap star.

969
00:51:20,111 --> 00:51:21,977
Nice to meet you.

970
00:51:21,979 --> 00:51:23,612
And you know Pauly.

971
00:51:23,614 --> 00:51:25,181
A good friend of mine.
Keith Robinson.

972
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:26,816
Keith.
How are you?

973
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:29,118
I'm good, how are you?
I'm great. Pleasure to meet you.

974
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,520
Pleasure to meet you
as well.

975
00:51:31,522 --> 00:51:33,656
I love your music.

976
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:35,124
Oh, well,
thank you so much.

977
00:51:35,126 --> 00:51:36,492
Yeah.
Yeah.

978
00:51:36,494 --> 00:51:38,094
Good to finally meet you.

979
00:51:38,096 --> 00:51:39,562
Give me one second.

980
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:40,996
Okay.

981
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:44,967
Hey, girl,
you look good.

982
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,302
So do you.

983
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:50,039
Excuse me one second.

984
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,540
Okay.

985
00:51:53,144 --> 00:51:54,777
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

986
00:51:54,779 --> 00:51:56,846
can I have your attention,
please, just for one second.

987
00:51:58,082 --> 00:52:00,883
I have a special request
from the host,

988
00:52:00,885 --> 00:52:02,518
the master of ceremony.

989
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,788
He wanted to do a special song
for the lady in his life.

990
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,557
It goes a little something
like this.

Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1002
00:52:45,863 --> 00:52:48,964
Salud, salud.
Y'all party tonight, man.

1003
00:52:48,966 --> 00:52:52,568
All right?
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

1004
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,206
Where the hell
you been?

1005
00:52:57,208 --> 00:52:59,708
It's 6:00 in the fucking
morning.

1006
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,477
Me and the girls
got a bite to eat.

1007
00:53:01,479 --> 00:53:04,246
Must have lost track
of time.

1008
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,749
I was worried.

1009
00:53:06,751 --> 00:53:08,751
Sorry, babe.

1010
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,053
Next time, call.

1011
00:53:11,055 --> 00:53:14,290
Almost made enough money
to cover Dad's next bill.

1012
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,593
Whatever.

1013
00:53:17,595 --> 00:53:19,395
Good night.

1014
00:53:32,343 --> 00:53:34,443
<i>Hello?</i>
Hey, beautiful.

1015
00:53:34,445 --> 00:53:36,245
Chicago?
<i>You still got those dreams</i>

1016
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:38,581
<i>of being a Hollywood actress?</i>
How'd you get this number?

1017
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:41,383
<i>Come on. You know I know
everybody in the city.</i>

1018
00:53:41,385 --> 00:53:43,519
A good friend of mine,
a big movie producer,

1019
00:53:43,521 --> 00:53:45,921
is throwing a wrap party
for his latest film.

1020
00:53:45,923 --> 00:53:48,190
He invited me out.
I want you to come with me.

1021
00:53:48,192 --> 00:53:49,992
Um, where?

1022
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:51,994
<i>Here?</i>
No, it's in Los Angeles.

1023
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:55,798
I can't.
I'm at the hospital with my dad.

1024
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,901
You sure? I mean, we could take
the red-eye out right after.

1025
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,369
I can't.

1026
00:54:00,371 --> 00:54:02,438
I mean, I was going
to compensate you for your time,

1027
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,773
but I'll just check you
when I get back in town.

1028
00:54:04,775 --> 00:54:06,575
No, wait.

1029
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:07,910
I'll go.

1030
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:09,411
Okay, cool.

1031
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:11,280
Meet me at the club
in two hours.

1032
00:54:11,282 --> 00:54:13,082
All right, bye.

1033
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:16,785
I see how
you look at her.

1034
00:54:16,787 --> 00:54:19,722
I know something's
going on.

1035
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:23,225
Are you fucking her?

1036
00:54:23,227 --> 00:54:24,727
I'm watching the game.

1037
00:54:24,729 --> 00:54:27,963
What about me?
My music?

1038
00:54:27,965 --> 00:54:29,765
Answer me.

1039
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:34,970
Lexus,

1040
00:54:34,972 --> 00:54:37,706
you don't ask me questions.

1041
00:54:37,708 --> 00:54:39,642
You answer them.

1042
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:43,345
Am I fucking clear?

1043
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,015
Okay.

1044
00:54:47,585 --> 00:54:48,817
Yeah.

1045
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,320
Good.

1046
00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:01,363
There's my Baby Girl.

1047
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,866
I didn't wake you, did I?

1048
00:55:07,672 --> 00:55:11,022
People wonder why we don't
have photos of us together.

1049
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:14,076
Where are you going,
sweetheart?

1050
00:55:14,078 --> 00:55:15,744
Work.

1051
00:55:18,082 --> 00:55:20,649
And you need to rest.

1052
00:55:20,651 --> 00:55:22,284
Oh.

1053
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:24,019
I slept enough today.

1054
00:55:26,457 --> 00:55:29,792
You remember that time
I was visiting you at FSU,

1055
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:32,661
and I caught you in that car
with some boy?

1056
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,096
Randy?

1057
00:55:34,098 --> 00:55:35,631
Randy.
Dad, he's just a friend.

1058
00:55:35,633 --> 00:55:37,733
I've told you that
a million times.

1059
00:55:37,735 --> 00:55:40,202
I just needed a ride
across campus.

1060
00:55:40,204 --> 00:55:44,940
I know. I shouldn't take a ride
if I can walk myself.

1061
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:47,576
Because if you do...

1062
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:49,345
You'll owe him a favour.

1063
00:55:49,347 --> 00:55:52,047
And you never want

1064
00:55:52,049 --> 00:55:54,550
to owe anybody

1065
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:59,054
for something
you can do yourself.

1066
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,074
Take this.

1067
00:56:19,076 --> 00:56:21,043
A hundred bucks?

1068
00:56:22,413 --> 00:56:23,979
What about
my field trip money?

1069
00:56:23,981 --> 00:56:26,582
Look, just get something to eat
for you and your brothers,

1070
00:56:26,584 --> 00:56:28,650
and pay the rent
up at the motel.

1071
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:31,820
I'll take care of it tomorrow,
okay, Auri?

1072
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:33,655
Okay, Mom.

1073
00:56:33,657 --> 00:56:37,092
Hey, Mr. Roscoe
will get you a cab.

1074
00:56:37,094 --> 00:56:38,994
I love you.

1075
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,130
I love you too, Mom.

1076
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,335
Yeah?

1077
00:56:46,337 --> 00:56:48,070
What time are you coming?

1078
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:51,874
Okay, I'll meet you in the
parking lot like I did before.

1079
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:54,009
Okay, bye.

1080
00:56:55,112 --> 00:56:56,378
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

1081
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,280
I think you need
to slow it down.

1082
00:56:58,282 --> 00:57:01,016
What?

1083
00:57:01,018 --> 00:57:02,918
You and Chicago
are getting closer.

1084
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,787
And maybe that's not
my business,

1085
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,722
but you have a good thing
with Kevin.

1086
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:09,458
It's rare. Special.

1087
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:11,226
You're right.

1088
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,429
It's not your business.

1089
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:15,197
Just don't get sucked up
in the bullshit.

1090
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:17,332
Chicago's just trying to
help me with my acting career.

1091
00:57:17,334 --> 00:57:19,902
He's never asked me for sex.

1092
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:22,638
I've never even given him
a lap dance.

1093
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,340
Yeah. So far.

1094
00:57:25,342 --> 00:57:27,810
So far? Sugar, I ain't you,
okay?

1095
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:30,012
I'm not going to be living
in a motel with my three kids.

1096
00:57:30,014 --> 00:57:33,782
I got a plan.
I know what I'm doing.

1097
00:57:39,423 --> 00:57:41,156
Hmm.

1098
00:58:07,485 --> 00:58:09,117
Hey.

1099
00:58:12,556 --> 00:58:14,590
Did you read my script?

1100
00:58:18,963 --> 00:58:21,196
I think it's time
to take a break from writing,

1101
00:58:21,198 --> 00:58:25,801
and focus on us making the money
we need to get out of here.

1102
00:58:25,803 --> 00:58:28,203
Can't do it all myself.

1103
00:58:29,807 --> 00:58:32,341
What, are you kidding?
What do you think I'm doing?

1104
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:35,444
I'm busting my ass at Kinkos
for minimum wage.

1105
00:58:35,446 --> 00:58:36,712
I'm whoring myself,

1106
00:58:36,714 --> 00:58:38,413
begging to sell copy
for spark plugs.

1107
00:58:38,415 --> 00:58:39,882
And let's not forget
about the year

1108
00:58:39,884 --> 00:58:43,619
I fucked my life away
in Tallahassee for you.

1109
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,429
I'll get you the rest
as soon as I can,

1110
00:58:54,431 --> 00:58:57,399
that way you can stop holding
all your little sacrifices

1111
00:58:57,401 --> 00:58:59,067
over my head.

1112
00:59:00,971 --> 00:59:03,781
What'd you have to do
for this kind of money?

1113
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:07,809
I sucked a big,
black dick.

1114
00:59:07,811 --> 00:59:09,478
Watch your fucking mouth,
Monica.

1115
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,880
Watch your
fucking mouth, Monica.

1116
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:14,917
I didn't do anything,
Kevin.

1117
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:28,430
I called you all night
last night.

1118
00:59:29,633 --> 00:59:31,099
Why didn't you pick up?

1119
00:59:31,101 --> 00:59:34,703
My battery died.
It's tired, just like I am.

1120
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:37,005
Tired?
Yeah, tired, okay?

1121
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:40,008
I'm sick of all your put-downs
and your neediness.

1122
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:42,911
Your jabs.
I'm sick of it.

1123
00:59:53,223 --> 00:59:55,624
Your dad's bills
are almost paid up.

1124
00:59:55,626 --> 00:59:57,559
When's enough money enough?

1125
00:59:57,561 --> 00:59:59,728
Our goal is 30.

1126
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,363
Is that okay?

1127
01:00:01,365 --> 01:00:03,265
Is that our goal?

1128
01:00:03,267 --> 01:00:05,200
Our goal?

1129
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:07,302
<i>When was the last time you talked to Kevin?</i>

1130
01:00:07,304 --> 01:00:10,505
Not since that night.

1131
01:00:10,507 --> 01:00:12,240
You haven't
fucked him again?

1132
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:15,010
I'm not trying to move in
on Monica's man.

1133
01:00:15,012 --> 01:00:17,412
Plus, I didn't think
you'd want me to anyway.

1134
01:00:17,414 --> 01:00:18,814
She wouldn't even notice.

1135
01:00:18,816 --> 01:00:21,383
That dirty bitch is too busy
jocking Chicago.

1136
01:00:21,385 --> 01:00:22,918
I mean,
what did Kevin say?

1137
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:26,321
He doesn't trust her.

1138
01:00:26,323 --> 01:00:28,190
He said he goes through
her purse every now and then.

1139
01:00:28,192 --> 01:00:31,760
Besides, you and Chicago have
that off-and-on relationship.

1140
01:00:31,762 --> 01:00:33,161
She's just a new piece of ass,

1141
01:00:33,163 --> 01:00:34,963
and once he gets tired
of looking at it,

1142
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:37,432
he's going to be right back
to you anyway.

1143
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:39,201
So, what do you care?

1144
01:00:39,203 --> 01:00:41,670
I just do.

1145
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:51,246
What about us?

1146
01:00:51,248 --> 01:00:53,482
I mean, you said we were
going to start a family

1147
01:00:53,484 --> 01:00:55,317
once the move.

1148
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:56,885
We will.

1149
01:00:56,887 --> 01:01:01,089
Just let me get through
this thing with Chicago, okay?

1150
01:01:01,091 --> 01:01:02,891
All right.

1154

Do you ever feel anything?

1155
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:36,191
I feel the beat
of the music.

1156
01:01:36,193 --> 01:01:40,095
And I think about how many 20s
I'm owed.

1157
01:01:43,167 --> 01:01:44,733
Why?

1158
01:01:46,637 --> 01:01:48,103
The look I see
on Monica's face

1159
01:01:48,105 --> 01:01:49,838
when she's giving a guy
a lap dance.

1160
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,507
It's like she likes it.

1161
01:01:52,509 --> 01:01:55,877
She always tell me
when the guys are touching her

1162
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,780
and kissing on her breasts,
grabbing her ass.

1163
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:00,348
It's like she feels nothing.

1164
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:03,785
It's like someone's
touching her elbow.

1165
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,156
I just want some truth.

1166
01:02:14,131 --> 01:02:15,397
Two for one drinks here,

1167
01:02:15,399 --> 01:02:18,900
Friday nights
at Hidden Treasures.

trying to touch your elbow?

1170
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:44,192
So, what else do you do?

1171
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:48,497
Besides producing music,
what are your other businesses?

1172
01:02:49,900 --> 01:02:52,801
I work in sales
and distribution.

1173
01:02:54,138 --> 01:02:57,472
I got to go out of town
for a couple of weeks on Sunday.

1174
01:02:57,474 --> 01:03:01,009
I would like to spend some time
with you before I leave,

1175
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:02,444
if that's okay?

1176
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,348
I don't know.

1177
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:10,018
Kevin and I are going through
some stuff.

1178
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:13,455
Can I be frank with you?

1179
01:03:13,457 --> 01:03:16,324
If you were my girl, I would
never share you with strangers.

1180
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:19,361
Kevin wouldn't either,
if we had a choice.

1181
01:03:19,363 --> 01:03:20,896
Come on.

1182
01:03:20,898 --> 01:03:23,131
You don't really
believe that, do you?

1183
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,333
I mean, that's the difference
between a boy like Kevin

1184
01:03:25,335 --> 01:03:26,535
and a man like me.

1185
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:32,040
I'll find a way to get you
out of that club.

1186
01:03:33,644 --> 01:03:35,844
My dad says
be careful of men

1187
01:03:35,846 --> 01:03:38,079
who give you something
for nothing.

1188
01:03:38,081 --> 01:03:41,516
I say what I mean,
and I mean what I say.

1189
01:03:41,518 --> 01:03:43,852
Always.

1190
01:03:45,756 --> 01:03:48,390
Hey, babe.

1191
01:03:48,392 --> 01:03:50,826
Babe, I'm tired.

1192
01:03:53,430 --> 01:03:55,297
Babe.

1193
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:57,966
Just get off.

1194
01:03:57,968 --> 01:03:59,467
I'm trying.

1195
01:04:03,373 --> 01:04:05,874
Wait, just back off.

1196
01:04:15,152 --> 01:04:16,918
When was the last time

1197
01:04:16,920 --> 01:04:18,787
you visited your dad
at the hospital?

1198
01:04:18,789 --> 01:04:21,056
Why are you bringing him
into this?

1199
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,726
I'll give you some
this weekend.

1200
01:04:24,728 --> 01:04:26,528
I promise.

1201
01:04:29,032 --> 01:04:30,565

1212
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,046
I liked it.

1213
01:05:19,316 --> 01:05:20,782
You're not lying
to me, now.

1214
01:05:20,784 --> 01:05:22,150
You know you can tell me
the truth.

1215
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:24,953
You know strippers
never tell the truth.

1216
01:05:27,391 --> 01:05:29,524
You ever think about
that night?

1217
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:32,294
What night?

1218
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,297
The night we took the X.

1219
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:38,700
That's crossed my mind
a few times.

1220
01:05:40,304 --> 01:05:43,414
Well, it's crossed my mind
like nine or ten times.

1221
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:54,616
Tell me something true
about you that no one knows.

1222
01:05:56,653 --> 01:05:58,954
My name is Julie.

1223
01:06:00,257 --> 01:06:02,257
And one day,
I want to have a kid.

1224
01:06:02,259 --> 01:06:04,793
And I'm going to name him
Arthur,

1225
01:06:04,795 --> 01:06:06,828
just like my father

1226
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,097
that I love so much.

1227
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:12,934
Matt said my take
was to be 50/50

1228
01:06:12,936 --> 01:06:15,470
in the VIP room last week.

1229
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,105
No, hell, no.
No, he wouldn't say that.

1230
01:06:17,107 --> 01:06:18,673
Nobody would say that
to you.

1231
01:06:18,675 --> 01:06:20,976
So now I'm a liar?
You're calling me a liar?

1232
01:06:20,978 --> 01:06:22,377
There's no call
for that, Momma.

1233
01:06:22,379 --> 01:06:24,579
She's going to pay me
what she owes me!

1234
01:06:24,581 --> 01:06:25,914
Listen, you know what?

1235
01:06:25,916 --> 01:06:27,749
First off,
it's not your money.

1236
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:30,685
Secondly, he's not your man.
You are delusional.

1237
01:06:30,687 --> 01:06:32,587
Oh, you calling me crazy?

1238
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,356
I don't know.
If the shoe fits, then wear it.

1239
01:06:34,358 --> 01:06:36,091
So if you can't handle
what's going on in here,

1240
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:38,560
I'm saying you're the one
who's leaving, not me.

1241
01:06:38,562 --> 01:06:39,561
You're fired.

1242
01:06:39,563 --> 01:06:41,162
What the hell is going on
in here?

1243
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,897
Huh? Look here, Pearl,

1244
01:06:42,899 --> 01:06:45,033
I can hear you
all the way downstairs.

1245
01:06:45,035 --> 01:06:46,601
Roscoe, she's fired!
Who's fired?

1246
01:06:46,603 --> 01:06:48,069
Momma, you ain't got
to be like that.

1247
01:06:48,071 --> 01:06:50,405
Are you on medication?
You need to be quiet,

1248
01:06:50,407 --> 01:06:52,173
because you ain't no better than
nobody else, not tipping out.

1249
01:06:52,175 --> 01:06:54,609
I think all y'all bitches
are stealing.

1250
01:06:54,611 --> 01:06:57,278
Kelly, Pearl, I can't have
this confusion back here.

1251
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,580
Now, Momma Pearl,
look here.

1252
01:06:58,582 --> 01:07:00,915
You ain't got authority
to fire nobody.

1253
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:02,217
Okay? And at least not her.

1254
01:07:02,219 --> 01:07:03,852
She been here so long
she got tenure.

1255
01:07:03,854 --> 01:07:05,620
Forget it, Roscoe. You know
what? I'm tired of this.

1256
01:07:05,622 --> 01:07:07,122
You want your little
thousand dollars?

1257
01:07:07,124 --> 01:07:08,456
You take your
little thousand dollars.

1258
01:07:08,458 --> 01:07:09,891
I'm going to go out there
and strut my ass,

1259
01:07:09,893 --> 01:07:12,460
and make twice that amount.

1260
01:07:12,462 --> 01:07:14,462
All right, look,
that's enough of this bullshit.

1261
01:07:14,464 --> 01:07:16,264
I want all y'all
back on the floor. Now!

1262
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:17,665
Oh!

1263
01:07:19,469 --> 01:07:20,802
Oh, oh, oh.

1264
01:07:20,804 --> 01:07:23,605
And you best mind
your business, Baby Girl.

1265
01:07:25,075 --> 01:07:26,508
Up next on the main stage...

1266
01:07:26,510 --> 01:07:28,710
I don't like that girl,

1267
01:07:28,712 --> 01:07:31,346
thinking she's better than
everybody else, try to be me.

1268
01:07:31,348 --> 01:07:34,182
Yeah. She's trying to steal
all our money.

1269
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:36,851
All up in Chicago's face, man.

1270
01:07:36,853 --> 01:07:38,720
Mm-hmm. I know.

1271
01:07:38,722 --> 01:07:41,256
I see everything that goes on
around here.

1272
01:07:41,258 --> 01:07:45,293
She's fucking up our
chances of getting out of here.

1273
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:48,029
You want her out?

1274
01:07:48,031 --> 01:07:49,431
Most definitely.

1275
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,633
I'm going to block her.

1276
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:56,204
What are you going to do?

1277
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:58,773
Don't even worry
about that.

1278
01:08:00,677 --> 01:08:03,411
Billie came by
the hospital today.

1279
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:05,080
Oh, yeah?
Did you give her the money

1280
01:08:05,082 --> 01:08:06,614
for Daddy's new specialist?

1281
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:08,249
I did.

1282
01:08:11,321 --> 01:08:14,889
Oh, and, um, Brandy called.

1283
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,791
We had a really nice talk.

1284
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:18,593
Yeah?

1285
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:19,861
She wanted to know

1286
01:08:19,863 --> 01:08:22,730
if those were Jimmy Choo's
or Louboutins

1287
01:08:22,732 --> 01:08:25,502
that you wore to the wrap party
last weekend.

1288
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:36,711
Oh...

1289
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:38,613
Uh... how...?

1290
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:40,815
How did...?
What did you tell her?

1291
01:08:40,817 --> 01:08:44,219
What did I tell her?

1292
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:47,155
That's what you're going
to ask me,

1293
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:48,823
is what did I tell her?

1294
01:08:48,825 --> 01:08:50,692
When were you going
to tell me you went to L.A.

1295
01:08:50,694 --> 01:08:51,793
with one of your johns,

1296
01:08:51,795 --> 01:08:53,595
or were... Were you ever
going to tell me?

1297
01:08:53,597 --> 01:08:55,930
Is that that fucking
Chicago guy?

1298
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:57,332
Kevin, lower your voice.

1299
01:08:57,334 --> 01:08:58,766
No, I'm not going to lower
my fucking voice.

1300
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,034
Kevin, lower your voice.

1301
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:01,536
I refuse to have
this conversation

1302
01:09:01,538 --> 01:09:03,171
in the middle of a diner.

1303
01:09:03,173 --> 01:09:04,873
Jesus.

1304
01:09:04,875 --> 01:09:07,709
You refuse a lot of things
these days.

1305
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:10,044
You already refused

1306
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:11,379
to read my script,

1307
01:09:11,381 --> 01:09:14,816
and you refused
to have sex with me.

1308
01:09:20,891 --> 01:09:23,992
Why don't you go and have your
boyfriend pick you up tonight.

1309
01:09:23,994 --> 01:09:26,528
Kevin, you know
nothing happened.

1310
01:09:26,530 --> 01:09:28,997
Kevin, stop.
You know nothing happened.

1311
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:31,399
I swear to you.

1312
01:09:31,401 --> 01:09:34,669
I did it for the money.

for picking me up.

1339
01:11:09,466 --> 01:11:11,799
Yeah, girl. Of course.
What's...

1340
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:12,800
What's going on?

1341
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:16,771
Kevin found out
Chicago took me to L.A.

1342
01:11:16,773 --> 01:11:20,041
and really blowing up
my phone.

1343
01:11:20,043 --> 01:11:22,343
I mean, Kevin was so pissed.

1344
01:11:22,345 --> 01:11:24,178
He just left me here.

1345
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,447
Monica, don't do this
to yourself.

1346
01:11:26,449 --> 01:11:31,653
You know, I thought
I was in control.

1347
01:11:31,655 --> 01:11:34,289
I wasn't.

1348
01:11:36,226 --> 01:11:38,092
I thought there would be
no consequences

1349
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:40,061
with all this money.

1350
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:41,896
Sure was right.

1351
01:11:44,134 --> 01:11:46,901
Well...
Just got sucked in.

1352
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:52,573
I haven't seen my dad
in over a week.

1353
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,609
I barely look him
in the eye.

1354
01:11:56,746 --> 01:12:00,381
Why does it always end
so fucked up?

1355
01:12:02,319 --> 01:12:04,752
Here's a question.

1356
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,824
You still love Kevin?

1357
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:13,861
I never stopped.

1358
01:12:13,863 --> 01:12:17,799
Well, there you go.
Got your answer.

1359
01:12:19,135 --> 01:12:22,003
Girl, I need to find him.

1360
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:24,739
We got to work this out.

1361
01:12:41,191 --> 01:12:43,524
Well, hello, lovebirds.

1362
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:46,094
Lexus, it's not what
it looks like.

1363
01:12:46,096 --> 01:12:47,695
Relax.

1364
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,164
You see, Jade Lee and I
have an open relationship.

1365
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:52,467
Just like you and Monica.

1366
01:12:52,469 --> 01:12:56,204
You see,
you got a certain thing

1367
01:12:56,206 --> 01:12:57,872
that I can't give Jade Lee.

1368
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:01,576
Although I'm not sure
what Chicago could give Monica

1369
01:13:01,578 --> 01:13:03,044
that you can't,

1370
01:13:03,046 --> 01:13:04,579
by the looks of things.

1371
01:13:04,581 --> 01:13:06,748
He doesn't
give her that.

1372
01:13:06,750 --> 01:13:09,851
Whores only love money.
Everything else is just an act.

1373
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:12,387
Lexi.

1374
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:23,564
Hey.

1375
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,067
Where have you been?
I was worried.

1376
01:13:26,069 --> 01:13:28,770
Welcome to my world,
you fucking whore.

1377
01:13:31,141 --> 01:13:32,607
Excuse me.

1378
01:13:34,144 --> 01:13:35,643
Kevin.

1379
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:40,248
Why are you going
through my things?

1380
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,849
What are you doing?

1381
01:13:43,019 --> 01:13:45,686
What the fuck is this?
Those aren't mine.

1382
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:47,321
Those aren't mine!
What the fuck is this?

1383
01:13:47,323 --> 01:13:49,490
Stupid bitch.

1384
01:13:51,594 --> 01:13:53,728
All the surprises
you got?

1385
01:13:55,198 --> 01:13:57,932
That's not mine either.

1386
01:13:57,934 --> 01:14:00,368
Kevin, the only time
I've ever done X

1387
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:02,637
was that one time with you.

1388
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:07,642
Wait...

1389
01:14:09,179 --> 01:14:10,778
What are you doing?

1390
01:14:14,451 --> 01:14:16,284
What does it look like
I'm doing?

1391
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:19,720
I can't believe
I was walking around guilty.

1392
01:14:21,124 --> 01:14:22,623
Guilty?

1393
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:25,159
For what?

1394
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:26,661
I fucked Jade Lee.

1395
01:14:26,663 --> 01:14:29,597
I fucked the shit
out of Jade Lee last night.

1396
01:14:29,599 --> 01:14:31,098
We both
got jungle fever.

1397
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:34,469
I never cheated on you,
you asshole.

1398
01:14:34,471 --> 01:14:37,071
At least I can admit
what I did.

1399
01:14:38,608 --> 01:14:39,941
If you're going to have sex,

1400
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,642
you might as well
get something out of it.

1401
01:14:41,644 --> 01:14:43,144
Ain't that right?

1402
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:50,885
You really don't know me at all,
do you?

1403
01:14:52,355 --> 01:14:53,888
Kevin!

1404
01:15:04,100 --> 01:15:07,235
The woman that I loved
was a good girl.

1405
01:15:08,771 --> 01:15:11,806
She loved her family
and she loved herself.

1406
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:14,141
You're just a cheap trick.

1407
01:15:22,519 --> 01:15:24,385
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1408
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:26,053
What the fuck is wrong
with you?!

1409
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:32,994
I'm gone.

1410
01:15:34,931 --> 01:15:36,764
Good. Leave.

1411
01:15:36,766 --> 01:15:39,600
I'll tell you right now,

1412
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:42,803
Chicago's twice the man
you'll ever be.

1413
01:15:42,805 --> 01:15:44,705
You're never
going to do anything

1414
01:15:44,707 --> 01:15:47,041
with those shitty stories.

1415
01:15:57,287 --> 01:15:59,387
It's probably for the best.

1416
01:15:59,389 --> 01:16:01,856
Acting, stripping.

1417
01:16:03,126 --> 01:16:06,427
You were always
just an attention whore.

1418
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,979
Monica, you're late.

1419
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:27,682
I was starting to think
you quit.

1420
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:32,219
What's wrong
with you?

1421
01:16:58,681 --> 01:17:00,581
Bitch, what the fuck?

1422
01:17:00,583 --> 01:17:03,117
You're planting shit in my purse
and in Kevin's head?

1423
01:17:03,119 --> 01:17:05,820
What the fuck are you
talking about, bitch?

1424
01:17:05,822 --> 01:17:08,456
Get off me!

1425
01:17:36,586 --> 01:17:38,653
Hello?

1426
01:17:38,655 --> 01:17:41,188
Yeah, we'll accept
the charges.

1427
01:17:41,190 --> 01:17:42,790
It's Monica.

1428
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:49,096
Where are you?

1429
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:51,866
All right.

1430
01:17:51,868 --> 01:17:54,468
What happened?

1431
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,705
Fucking bitches, man.
Fighting in the club.

1432
01:17:57,707 --> 01:17:59,240
Going to go get her?

1433
01:17:59,242 --> 01:18:00,875
Hell, no.

1434
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:03,778
Let her ass sit in there
for a minute.

1435
01:18:03,780 --> 01:18:05,346
Let me tell you something,
Black.

1436
01:18:05,348 --> 01:18:07,314
The minute you go running
after a woman

1437
01:18:07,316 --> 01:18:09,583
is the minute you lose
all your power.

1438
01:18:09,585 --> 01:18:11,852
Oh, man, I know that.

1439
01:18:11,854 --> 01:18:13,521
Everything I do,
every move I make

1440
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:16,991
is situated so I don't have
to jump when people want me to.

1441
01:18:16,993 --> 01:18:18,959
It's about outsmarting

1442
01:18:18,961 --> 01:18:21,295
the man or woman
next to you.

1443
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:24,999
Making them think they got
a choice when they really don't.

1444
01:18:29,605 --> 01:18:30,971
Checkmate.

1445
01:18:30,973 --> 01:18:33,641
My feet always hurt
at the end of the day.

1446
01:18:33,643 --> 01:18:35,810
Trudy, is Monica here?

1447
01:18:35,812 --> 01:18:38,512
She went to jail
for fighting.

1448
01:18:38,514 --> 01:18:40,014
She went to jail
for fighting?

1449
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:41,782
Yeah.
Goddamn. Thank you, Trudy.

1450
01:18:41,784 --> 01:18:44,218
Good luck!
Thank you, Trudy.

1451
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:48,122
I can't stand him.
He always orders water.

1452
01:18:55,331 --> 01:18:56,764
Monica!

1453
01:18:59,001 --> 01:19:00,434
Monica!

1454
01:19:15,952 --> 01:19:17,918
Thanks for getting me out.

1455
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:19,487
No problem.

1456
01:19:20,623 --> 01:19:22,022
I'm sorry.

1457
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:24,458
So, what are you
going to do?

1458
01:19:26,262 --> 01:19:28,329
About what?

1459
01:19:28,331 --> 01:19:29,563
Monica, I like you.

1460
01:19:29,565 --> 01:19:31,232
I really do.

1461
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:32,867
But I can't
keep sitting around

1462
01:19:32,869 --> 01:19:35,936
while you chasing
some broke fool all around town.

1463
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:39,173
I'm laying it
on the line here.

1464
01:19:39,175 --> 01:19:41,709
But you got
to make a choice.

1465
01:19:41,711 --> 01:19:43,010
It's either him or me.

1466
01:19:43,012 --> 01:19:46,547
He's gone. He left.

1467
01:19:46,549 --> 01:19:48,215
Listen...

1468
01:19:49,685 --> 01:19:52,419
I got to go to L.A.
on business.

1469
01:19:54,023 --> 01:19:56,257
My birthday
is in three days.

1470

Okay.

What side of town
do you want to live on?

1516
01:23:15,057 --> 01:23:17,324
Beverly Hills
or Bel Air is fine.

1517
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:19,093
And I'm going to start you out
on an allowance

1518
01:23:19,095 --> 01:23:20,594
of $5,000 a month.

to the opera tonight.

1520
01:23:22,832 --> 01:23:27,134
The opera? Oh, you know what?
We should go to a Lakers game.

1521
01:23:27,136 --> 01:23:30,604
I spent $6,000
on three tickets to the opera.

1522
01:23:30,606 --> 01:23:33,807
Now I got to run out
and take care of some business,

1523
01:23:33,809 --> 01:23:36,944
but I'll be back at 7:00.

any questions.

Hey. What are you
doing here?

1531
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:20,854
Is Lexus here?

1532
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:22,890
No. Why?

1533
01:24:22,892 --> 01:24:24,591
It's about Monica's dad.

1534
01:24:24,593 --> 01:24:26,160
I need to reach her.

1535
01:24:27,363 --> 01:24:29,897
I... I can't help you.

1536
01:24:29,899 --> 01:24:31,799

Hey...

1537
01:24:31,801 --> 01:24:33,434
this is serious.

1538
01:24:33,436 --> 01:24:35,569

to my face?

1539
01:24:35,571 --> 01:24:38,072
Yes. I get it.

I don't know what you mean.

1611
01:30:32,094 --> 01:30:34,227
It was Lexus

1612
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:36,963
who put the condoms
and the ecstasy in your purse.

1613
01:30:36,965 --> 01:30:39,933
I didn't even know
anything about it.

1614
01:30:39,935 --> 01:30:41,668
Where is she now?

1615
01:30:41,670 --> 01:30:43,870
She's in Vegas.

1616
01:30:43,872 --> 01:30:47,340
Chicago promised her
some lounge act.

1617
01:30:47,342 --> 01:30:49,776
But we all know
how that goes.

1618
01:30:53,282 --> 01:30:54,714
I just, um...

1619
01:30:54,716 --> 01:30:56,883
I just thought
you should know.

1620
01:30:56,885 --> 01:31:00,454
None of it really matters
anyways.

1621
01:31:00,456 --> 01:31:02,022
It does matter.

1622
01:31:02,024 --> 01:31:04,691
You loved him once.

1623
01:31:04,693 --> 01:31:07,223
Girl, and I know
that he still loves you.

1624
01:31:10,232 --> 01:31:11,698
Have you talked to him?

1625
01:31:11,700 --> 01:31:14,434
No, not since that night.

1626
01:31:14,436 --> 01:31:17,471
You know where he is?

1627
01:31:17,473 --> 01:31:21,007
No. And why do you
want to know?

1628
01:31:21,009 --> 01:31:22,809
Because I know
where he's at.

1629
01:31:22,811 --> 01:31:24,878
Do you?
You know what? You're done.

1630
01:31:26,081 --> 01:31:27,447
Same old Monica.

1631
01:31:27,449 --> 01:31:29,516
And what about my other hand?

1632
01:31:29,518 --> 01:31:30,884
You're done.

1633
01:31:30,886 --> 01:31:33,653
Jade Lee,
whose baby is it?

1634
01:31:33,655 --> 01:31:36,156
The truth.
Truth?

1635
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:40,660
Don't you know strippers
never tell the truth?

1636
01:31:40,662 --> 01:31:42,696
Hey, were you telling
the truth

1637
01:31:42,698 --> 01:31:44,598
when you told Kevin
that you never feel anything

1638
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:46,266
during a lap dance?

1639
01:31:46,268 --> 01:31:50,237
Or how about that his writing
is shitty?

1640
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:54,841
Were you telling the truth
when you told him

1641
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:57,544
that Chicago is twice the man
he was?

1642
01:31:57,546 --> 01:32:00,180
The truth is,

1643
01:32:00,182 --> 01:32:01,915
you still need him.

1644
01:32:01,917 --> 01:32:04,718
And I know he still
needs you.

1645
01:32:06,588 --> 01:32:08,722
Here.

1646
01:32:10,225 --> 01:32:12,025
You should call him.

Mani or pedi?

01:33:52,761 --> 01:33:56,129
I know you got
about three hours.

1676
01:34:00,435 --> 01:34:02,936
Kevin.

1677
01:34:20,122 --> 01:34:23,056
I missed you.

1678
01:34:23,058 --> 01:34:24,724
I...

1679
01:34:24,726 --> 01:34:27,027
But I thought
you were in L.A.

1680
01:34:28,397 --> 01:34:30,864
I'm finally making a movie.

1681
01:34:30,866 --> 01:34:33,333
You're in Houston?

1682
01:34:33,335 --> 01:34:38,238
Just told the producers,
"Tax incentives."

1683
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:42,409
It's an interesting
topography.

I'm so sorry
about everything.

1686
01:34:52,821 --> 01:34:55,855
We both made mistakes.

1687
01:34:57,492 --> 01:35:00,827
Do you think we can
put it back together?

1688
01:35:05,233 --> 01:35:08,133
We never really needed it...
except each other.

1689
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:11,738
Someone heard that I, uh...

1690
01:35:11,740 --> 01:35:13,707
sold my script.

1691
01:35:13,709 --> 01:35:16,943
Oh, my God.
This is your script?

1692
01:35:18,947 --> 01:35:21,581
That is the best news.

1693
01:35:21,583 --> 01:35:22,583
The best.

1694
01:35:26,188 --> 01:35:29,723
