今天的烤子鱼特别新鲜

3
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,918
不好意思，打扰你们吃饭

4
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,190
不要紧，我们过那边坐
Never mind, let's sit over there

5
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:14,730
怎么这样晚？
It's quite late

6
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,058
是啊，刚下班
I've just finished work

7
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:18,820
怎么称呼你
What should I call you?

8
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:19,912
叫我孙太太
You can call me Mrs. Suen

9
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:21,520
你呢？
And you?

10
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,775
我先生姓陈
My husband's name is Chan

11
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:25,673
- 决定了就给我电话 - 好的
Call me when you decide I will

12
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,666
有没有把号码抄下
Did you write down my number?

13
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:28,903
抄下了
Yes, I did

14
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:30,676
那好，我送你出去
Fine, I'll see you out

15
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:33,998
- 不用了 - 要的，大家上海人嘛
Don't trouble No trouble

16
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:45,508
那么就这样决定了
So it's agreed then

17
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:47,167
谢谢你，我先走了
Thank you very much, I should go

18
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,338

19
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:49,986
慢走，再会
Take care, goodbye

20
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,064
请问这里是不是有房间出租？
You've a room to let?

21
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:56,977
真对不起，刚租给那位太太
Sorry, it's just been rented to that lady

22
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,467
谢谢你
Thanks

23
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:00,991
你几个人住？
How many of you?

24
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,468
我跟我太太两个人
Just me and my wife

25
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,115
你不妨到隔壁试试看
Why don't you try next door

26
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,542
隔壁有房间出租吗？
They've a vacant room too?

27
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:09,832
是，隔壁顾先生的儿子刚结婚
Yes, Mr.Koo's son got married

28
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:10,886
搬了出去
and removed out

29
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,539
房间也想找人租
His room's empty

30
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:13,991
谢谢你
Thank you

00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,447
来，这里
This way, come on

34
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:25,852
这个不是我们的
Not that room

35
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:30,738
怎么搞的，真麻烦
Wrong again

36
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,533
先靠墙放着，小心啊
Careful, against the wall there

37
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:41,332
小柜子靠在那边
The little cupboard over there

38
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:42,527
慢慢来
Be careful

39
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:44,961
小心，别碰坏别人的东西
Don't break anything

40
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,173
别压坏了收音机
Not on top of the radio

41
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:48,805
周先生
Mr.Chow

42
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,125
怎么家俱这样多？
You have a lot of stuff for a couple

43
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,250
- 这个柜不是我的 - 又搬错？
The wardrobe isn't mine, wrong again?

44
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,380
是不是隔壁的？
It does next door

45
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,395
那搬回去，搬回去
Okay, next door

46
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,593
这些鞋子不是我的，是不是拿错了
There aren't my shoes

47
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,756
我想是隔壁的，拿过去吧
They must go next door

48
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,606
真是巧，搬家都碰在一起
What a coincidence, moving in on same day

49
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,996
怎么没看见你先生？
Is Mr.Chan here?

50
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,110
公司有事派他出门了
He's working abroad

51
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:12,369
下礼拜才回来
He'll be back next week

52
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,920
那你该等他回来再搬嘛
You should have waited, then

53
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:18,525
搬家那么辛苦，你一个人应付得了吗？
It's too much for you on your own

54
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:21,282
- 我可以的 - 叫王妈帮忙
I can manage I'll ask Amah to help

55
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,474
别客气，孙太太，我自己行的
No need, I can manage

56
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,489
怎么回事？
What's going on?

57
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,365
小心那镜子
Mind that mirror

58
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:29,387
陈太太，你继续收拾好了
Mrs. Chan, I'll leave you to it

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,239
- 这些书不是我的 - 又错了？
Those books aren't mine Wrong again?

60
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,525
不要紧，先放下吧
Never mind, just leave them there

61
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,997
这个小心放，这些会砸烂的
Mind how you hang the mirror it's fragile

62
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,237
这些杂志是不是你的？
Are these magazines yours?

63
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,476
是的，我先生的
Yes, they're my husband's

64
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,096
你先生懂日文啊？
He reads Japanese?

65
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,318
懂一点，他老板是日本人
A little, his boss is Japanese

66
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:53,090
还没请教你贵姓？
How should I address you?

67
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:54,368
我先生姓陈
My husband's name is Chan

68
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,877
我姓周，我先回去了
My name's Chow... I'll leave you in peace

69
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:57,955
谢谢你周先生
Thank you, Mr.Chow

70
00:03:58,136 --> 00:03:59,012
不客气
Don't mention it

71
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:03,877
我去叫陈太太
I'll ask Mrs. Chan...

72
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:09,247
陈太太，跟我们一起吃饭吧
Mrs. Chan, eat with us before you go

73
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:11,723
我不吃了，我赶时间，我得去机场

00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,972
- 你先生回来了？ - 是的
Your husband's coming back? Yes

75
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,394
那我不耽误你了
Then I won't keep you

76
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,648
- 出去呀？ - 晚安
Going out? Yes

77
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,811
对不起，我迟了
Sorry, I'm late

78
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,877
王妈，快点倒酒
Amah, pour some beer

79
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:28,209
干杯
Cheers

80
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:34,239
- 周太太，尝一尝我们的上海家常菜 - 我自己来就行了
Mrs. Chow, try some Shanghai dishes

81
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:35,939
陈太太到哪里去了？
Where is Mrs. Chan to so late?

82
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:39,554
她去接飞机嘛，她先生回来了
Meeting here husband at the airport

83
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,538
怪不得打扮得那么漂亮
So that's why she looks different

84
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,896
我都帮你收拾好了，你自己小心点

145
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:23,955
我先生从日本带回来的
My husband brought it from Japan

146
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:26,338
我看挺好，所以介绍给顾太太
I wanted to show Mrs. Koo how good it is

147
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:28,582
跳起来了，跳起来了
Now it's ready

148
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:30,958
这回真行了，你看多方便
It's workable, you can see

149
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:39,062
陈太太
Mrs. Chan

150
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,992
麻烦你陈先生，下次帮我带一个回来
Could Mr.Chan get me one next time?

151
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,116
好，没问题
No problem

152
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:47,596
周先生，你也应该买上一个
Mr.Chow, you should get one too

153
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,921
你太太老是值夜班，有了它就方便多了
Your wife's so often late home

154
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,957
麻烦陈先生不太好意思
I couldn't trouble Mr.Chan

155
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,273
隔壁邻居，无所谓啦
It's just neighborly, isn't it?

156
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,991
不要紧，他过两天会再去
It's no trouble

157
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:02,275
我叫他多带一个回来
I'll ask him to buy another next time

158
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:03,888
那么多谢你了
Thank you

159
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,811
来，我们尝尝
Let's try the rice

160
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:20,665
真不好意思，要你老远带电饭锅给我
Mr.Chan, sorry to trouble you about the rice cooker

161
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:22,913
顺手的嘛，用不着客气
It was really no trouble

162
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,431
还没付钱你，该多少钱？
How much do I owe you?

163
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,990
你太太已经给我了
Your wife has already paid me

164
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:29,845
是吗？
Really?

165
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,011
她没告诉你？
She didn't tell you?

166
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,554
她这阵子值夜班
She's been working late shifts

167
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,229
等她回来我已经睡了
Often I'm asleep when she gets back

168
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,689
在酒店做事也真辛苦
It must be hard for her

169
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:38,731
是啊
Yes

170
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:40,585
陈太太还没回来？
Mrs. Chan isn't back yet?

171
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,826
我想她快回来了，你有事找她？
She'll be back soon, you need to talk to her

172
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,900
我有个朋友过两天去新加坡
A friend needs to go to Singapore

173
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:49,704
想看看陈太太的公司有没有 便宜点的船票
I wonder if she could get a cheap ticket for him

174
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:51,360
等她回来我告诉她
I'll ask when she gets back

175
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:53,977
麻烦你们不好意思
I'm bothering you too much

176
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,991
客什么气，大家隔壁邻居，应该的
Don't mention it, we're neighbors

177
00:10:58,674 --> 00:10:59,884
那么我先回去了
I'll leave you in peace

178
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,912
怎么，找我？
Looking for me?

179
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:11,319
打着锣找呢，整个上午到哪儿去了？
Damn right, where've you been?

180
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,820
什么事呀？
What's up?

181
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:14,982
陈太太打电话来
Mrs. Chan called

182
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,488
说你把帽子忘在她公司了
you left a hat at her office

183
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:20,378
我故意的，不然哪有机会多看她两眼
I meant to, I wanted an excuse to go back

184
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:22,208
早知你会来这一手
I know your tricks

185
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,434
人家可是有老公的
she's married

186
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:27,172
我当然知道她有老公
I know

187
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,969
要不我还回来干嘛
That's why I left

188
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:30,736
干脆搬到你那儿去
otherwise I'd move in next door

189
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,444
说真的，幸好你老婆也是美人
If your wife wasn't so attractive

190
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:35,144
要不然我可要替她担心
She'd be a worried woman

191
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:38,805
你当我是你啊
I'm not like you

192
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,764
帮我打电话约陈太太
Please call Mrs. Chan for me

193
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,960
说我明天上她公司拿帽子
I'll pick up the hat tomorrow

194
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,527
顺便请她喝茶
And take her to lunch

195
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,286
你想得美
Dream on, I asked her to

196
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,571
我跟她说了，把帽子先拿回家
take the hat home

197
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,113
明早我帮你带回来
I'll bring it in tomorrow

198
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:55,340
真泄气，还是老朋友呢
You're kidding, some buddy you are

199
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,238
索性我跟你回家去
Tell you what, let's go pick up now

200
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,702
这个钟点应该下班了
She should be off work by now

201
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:01,942
一块儿接她下班去
We can go together

202
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:03,653
懒得跟你讲
I don't have time for this

203
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:05,419
阿周
Chow

204
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,925
来啦，快走吧，我还要忙
Yes, get out of here, I'm busy

205
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,804
这样吧，我先走，在家等你
Then I'll wait at your place

206
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:11,947
就这么说定了
That's all

207
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:13,973
炳，炳
Ping

208
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:24,274
周先生，顾先生在不在？
Mr.Chow, is Mr.Koo in?

209
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,387
他出去了，又忘了买报纸了?
He's out, forgot to buy the paper again?

210
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:28,839
是，我待会儿再来
That's right, I'll stop by later

211
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:31,322
- 我帮你找找看 - 谢谢你
Maybe I can find it for you Thank you

212
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:43,737
- 是这一张吗？ - 是的
This one? Yes

213
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,816
我以前也常看的，一天不看就不自在
I always loved those serials, hated to miss an episode

214
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,716
是吗？你也喜欢看武侠小说？
Really? You like them too?

215
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:54,163
迷过一阵子，我还想过自己写
I even thought of writing one

216
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,956
为什么没写
Why didn't you?

217
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,122
想来想去开不了头，也就算了
I couldn't get started, so I gave up

218
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,411
注定不是干这一行的
I wasn't born to write martial arts stories

219
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,962
那些武侠小说我都留着，要看你拿去
But you can borrow from my collection any time

220
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:07,100
不了，下回再麻烦你，谢谢你
Not now, maybe another time, thanks

221
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:08,033
不客气
You're welcome

222
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,567
什么事，陈太太？
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

223
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:20,767
这些书还给周先生的，他在不在家？
I just want to return these to Mr.Chow is he in?

224
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,615
他好几天没回来
He's been away for a few days

225
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:24,019
怎么回事？
Why?

226
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,299
两夫妻吵架了
They had a quarrel

227
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:30,000
你把书搁下吧，等周先生回来
Leave them with me

228
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,517
我帮你还给他
I'll pass them back to him

229
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:32,862
谢谢
Thank you

230
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,091
不用了
Forget it

231
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,741
今晚我值夜班
I'm on a replacement shift tonight

232
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:47,554
你先回去吧
Talk to you later

233
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:56,029
再说吧，今晚我会迟一点， 你不用来接我了
No need to pick me up

234
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,505
她已经走啦
She's already left

235
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:04,919
是吗，还想接她一块吃夜宵
Really? I was going to take her out for supper

236
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,593
她没告诉你吗？她今天早下班
Didn't she tell you she was off early today

237
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,863
她老是这样，颠三倒四的
She never remembers to tell me

238
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,521
说不定已经回到家里了
Maybe she's home by now

239
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:16,976
那我先走了
I'll be off, then

240
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:18,657
好的，再见
Okay, bye

241
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:44,078
你好
Hello

242
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,281
你出院了吗？
You're out of hospital

243
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:01,234
先别说了，借我三十块
Don't mention hospital, Lend me $30

244
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,326
干什么？
What for?

245
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,934
帮帮忙，名誉攸关
You gotta help me save face

246
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:05,998
出了什么大事？
What's the big deal?

247
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,999
还不是那个阿海，那天来医院看我
It's Ah Hoi's fault

248
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,913
说有内幕消息，稳赢的
He gave me a racing tip, said it was a sure thing

249
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,099
我看他那么有把握，线都来不及拆
Before they'd taken out the stitches

250
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,470
一股劲跑出医院，赶去马场
I rushed from hospital to Race Course

251
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,827
把老婆本都押上了
I bet everything I had

252
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,209
结果输了个精光
and I lost my shirt

253
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,801
活该，刚开完刀还要去赌
What did you expect?

254
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:25,806
我想负伤上阵，必有大运
I thought it was my lucky day

255
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,235
谁知输剩两块钱
Anyhow, I had only $2 left

256
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:31,696
赌气就跑去找贵妃
So I went to the whorehouse

257
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:33,876
病到这样子你还要去玩女人啊？
You were in no shape for sex

258
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:35,583
想冲冲喜嘛
I thought it would improve for sex

259
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,879
不是只剩两块钱？够吗？
What would $2 buy you?

260
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:45,193
我是常客，好商量，先赊着也可以的
I'm Kwai Fei's regular, she gives me credit

261
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:47,644
这种事情也可以赊账？
You can have in on credit?

262
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,892
把身份证押给她
I left my ID card and

263
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,218
说好两三天后回去拿
said I'd be back to redeem it

264
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,418
原以为这么一点钱很容易
I thought a few dollars would be back easy to rustle up

265
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,952
谁知到现在还没搞定，还过了期
But so far nothing I'm way overdue

266
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,203
那怎办？
So?

267
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,109
怎办？昨儿小四上去
Four Eyes was there yesterday

268
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,157
可不就看见她拿着我那张身份证
Saw her waving my ID around in

269
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:02,196
到处让人看
front of everyone

270
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:03,179
你说衰不衰啊？
So embarrassing

271
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:04,911
先别说了，给我三十块
Anyway, lend me $30

272
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:12,955
我只有那么多
This is all can spare

273
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,994
留十块，这些你拿去用
I need $10 for myself

274
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:20,744
月初就还你
Pay you back next month

275
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,632
- 去吃宵夜 - 还要吃宵夜？
Let's have a late snack What?

276
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:27,043
一整天就吃了一碗云吞面，都快饿死了
All I've had today is some won-ton noodles

277
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:29,052
等我写好这一段吧
Let me finish writing this first

278
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:35,053
有件事，我不知道要不要跟你说
I'm not sure I should tell you this

279
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:36,374
什么事？
What?

280
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,549
昨天在街上看见你老婆
I saw your wife in the street yesterday

281
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:40,869
这有什么好奇怪的？
So what?

282
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:43,988
奇怪倒不奇怪
That is nothing

283
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,654
不过她好像跟一个男人走在一起
but she was with some guy

284
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:51,714
可能是她朋友
Probably a friend

285
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,563
说得也对，我不过是随便说说而已
Just thought you should know

286
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:02,074
余小姐吗，我是苏秘书啊
Miss Yu? This is me

287
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:04,829
何先生还在谈事情
Mr.Ho's still in a meeting

288
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:06,913
他说晚上恐怕不能跟你吃饭
he says he can't manage dinner

289
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,821
是，我们这阵子很忙
Yes, we're very busy now

290
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:19,337
好的，我会跟他说，再见
I'll, I'll ask Mr.Ho to call

291
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,950
- 你跟余小姐说了没有？ - 说过了
Have you called Miss Yu? Yes, I've

292
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:28,528
她怎么说？
What did she say?

293
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,550
她叫你晚一点给她电话
Asks you to call her later

294
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:33,344
何太太来过电话，说快切蛋糕了
And Mrs. Ho says she's ready to cut her birthday cake

295
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,848
叫你快回去
She wants you to hurry home

296
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,877
- 礼物买了没有？ - 买了
Did you get me something to give her? Yes, this

297
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:39,874
- 是什么东西？ - 是围巾
What is it? A scarf

298
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:43,135
- 我想何太太会喜欢吧 - 麻烦你了
I think Mrs. Ho will like it Thank you

299
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,609
用剩的钱
And here's your change

300
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:47,600
不用了，你拿着，老是麻烦你
I'm always troubling you

301
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:48,628
车费也要的
use it for bus fare

302
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,495
不如，到我家吃顿便饭？
Why don't you dine with us tonight?

303
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:54,614
别客气，我约了我先生看电影
Thank you, I've already planned to see a film tonight

304
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:56,411
那就不妨碍你们了
Then I won't keep you

305
00:19:57,141 --> 00:19:58,496
明天上午没什么事
Tomorrow will be quiet

306
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,055
你可以下午才回来
take the morning off

307
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,511
- 再见 - 再见
Goodbye goodbye

308
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,894
你今天晚上会出去吗？
Are you going out tonight?

309
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,664
记得拿钥匙
Don't forget your keys

310
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:17,768
孙太太他们去吃喜酒
All the neighbors are dining out tonight

311
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,976
公司很忙，我会晚点回来
I have a lot to do here so I'll be late

312
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:39,457
什么事，陈太太
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

313
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,477
我听见隔壁有声音
I heard voices

314
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,545
还以为是顾先生顾太太回来
I thought Mr.& Mrs. Koo were back

315
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:47,127
还没有，你找他们有事？
Not yet, anything I can help with?

316
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:51,472
没什么，找他们聊聊天
No, I just wanted a chat

317
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:54,409
- 你一个人？ - 是
Are you alone? Yes, I am

318
00:20:58,047 --> 00:20:59,841
这么早回来？
You're back early today

319
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,944
有点不舒服，就早点回来了
I'm not feeling well, I came back to rest

320
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:08,231
你哪里不舒服，我有药
What is it? I have some medicines

321
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,400
不用了，我睡会儿就好
Don't trouble yourself, I'll sleep it off

322
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:16,108
好，我不打扰了
In that case, I'll leave you in peace

323
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:23,787
你的老婆
It was your wife

324
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:28,380
跟你老婆说了没有？
Have you spoken to your wife yet?

325
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:31,168
那么你以后别再找我
Then we shouldn't meet any more

326
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,635
菲律宾那边有没有消息
Any news from the Philippines?

327
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,241
刚收到电报
Yes, a telex

328
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:24,489
说那边刮台风，船都不能开
There's a typhoon, so the ship's still docked

329
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,696
那么你马上通知陈先生
Please inform Chan

330
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,935
说他那批货可能要晚一两天才能到
That the shipment may be delayed

331
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:31,882
问他有没有问题
Ask if that's a problem

332
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:36,953
何太太打过电话来
Your wife rang

333
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:38,981
说用不着回家去接她
you don't need to pick her up

334
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:40,669
她在跟刘太太打牌
She's playing mahjong with Mrs. Lau

335
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:43,168
你五点半直接上天香楼找她便行
She'll meet you at the restaurant at 5:30

336
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,562
余小姐有一份礼物交给你
and there's a gift from Miss Yu

337
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:50,057
她上来过？
She was here?

338
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:51,835
不，她找人送上来的
No, she had it sent over

339
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:54,602
她说知道你今天生日，应酬多
She says she'll dine alone since it's your birthday

340
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:55,717
所以不找你吃饭了
Please phone her

341
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,581
叫你有空再给她电话
when you have a moment

342
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:02,872
- 我帮你倒杯咖啡 - 谢谢
I'll get you another coffee Thank you

343
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,360
谢谢
Thank you

344
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:34,218
领带很漂亮
That tie looks good on you

345
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,810
你看得出我换了领带吗？
You noticed?

346
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:39,429
我还以为差不多
It's much like the old one

347
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:42,555
仔细看能看出来
You notice things if you pay attention

348
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:56,982
我先走了
I'll be off now

349
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:58,634
如果陈先生那边有问题
If Chan has a problem

350
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,672
打电话到天香楼找我
let me know at the restaurant

351
00:24:01,391 --> 00:24:02,467
怎么把领带又换了？
Why did you change your tie?

352
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,425
我嫌那条太花俏了点儿
The new one was too showy

353
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:06,201
还是换回原来的好
I should stick with my own

354
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:07,624
记得锁门啊
Don't forget to lock up

355
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,996
对了，最近很少看见你先生
By the way, haven't seen your husband lately

356
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,535
是呀，这阵子他公司有事，派了他出去
He's abroad now, on company business

357
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,961
怪不得老在面摊碰见你
That's why I see you at the noodle stall

358
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:07,528
一个人懒得煮饭
I don't like cooking for myself

359
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:11,367
对了，你太太呢？最近也很少看见她
Haven't seen your wife lately either

360
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:15,651
她妈妈身体不太舒服，回娘家陪陪她
Her mother's ill, she's at home with her

361
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:17,987
难怪了
That explains it

362
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:21,999
- 晚安 - 晚安
Good night Good night

363
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:24,657
陈太太，你回来就好了
Mrs. Chan, I'm glad you're back

364
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:26,392
外面雨下得那么凶
It's raining so hard

365
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,868
我还想打伞去接你呢
I was going to look for you with and umbrella

366
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:30,376
不过是阵头雨，你有心
You are too kind

367
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:31,259
王妈，是谁？
Amah, who is it?

368
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,606
是陈太太
It's Mrs. Chan

369
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,522
孙太太
Mrs. Suen

370
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:35,702
哎呀，下那么大雨还出去呀
Caught in the rain? I said you could

371
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:38,890
大家自己人，早叫你一道吃
eat with us

372
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:41,255
下回吧，慢慢打
Next time, Enjoy your game

373
00:26:43,946 --> 00:26:45,945
哎呀，她先生一天到晚在外头
Her husband's always away

374
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,686
她一个人孤伶伶怪可怜的
It's sad to see her to lonely

375
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,227
出去买碗面，还穿得真漂亮
She dresses up like that to go out for noodle

376
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:05,816
周先生，怎么到这边来了？
Mr.Chow, What are you doing here?

377
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:08,362
我过来叫顾太太听电话
Just calling Mrs. Koo to the phone

378
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:11,284
这么晚？
You're late back

379
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:13,283
刚看了场电影
I went to the picture

380
00:27:14,754 --> 00:27:15,869
我先回去了
I'll be going

381
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,466
喂
Hello

382
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:26,668
啊，你等等啊
Yes, please hold on

383
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:29,227
- 是谁的电话？ - 陈太太的电话
Who is it? It's for Mrs. Chan

384
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,413
那么冒昧约你出来，是有点事想请教你
It must seem odd to ask you out but I want to ask something

385
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:46,338
你今天下午拿着的皮包
That handbag I saw you with this evening

386
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:47,931
不知道哪里有的买？
Where did you buy it?

387
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,683
你为什么这样问？
Why do you ask?

388
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,546
哦，我看款式很别致
It looked so elegant

389
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:56,064
想买一个送给我太太
I want to get one for my wife

390
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:01,582
周先生对太太真细心
Mr.Chow, you're so good to your wife

391
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:06,025
那里，她这人很挑剔
Not really, my wife is so fussy

392
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,560
过两天她生日
Her birthday is two days away

393
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,134
不知道买什么送给她才好
I don't know what to get her

394
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,332
你可不可以帮我买一个？
Could you buy one for me to give her?

395
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:20,690
要是一模一样的，她会不喜欢吧
Maybe she wouldn't want one just exactly the same

396
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:25,199
说的也是，我倒也没想到
You're right, I didn't think of that

397
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,129
女人会介意，对吧？
Women would mind

398
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,990
会的，特别是隔壁邻居
Yes, especially since we're neighbors

399
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:35,869
不知道会不会有别的颜色
Do they come in other colors?

400
00:28:39,078 --> 00:28:40,716
那要问我先生才知道
I'd have to ask my husband

401
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,660
为什么？
Why?

402
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:44,470
那皮包是我先生
He bought it for me

403
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:46,408
在外地工作的时候买给我的
on a business trip abroad

404
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:48,822
他说在香港没有卖的
They aren't on sale here

405
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:54,143
那就算了吧
Then never mind

406
00:29:01,662 --> 00:29:02,538
其实
Actually

407
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,268
我也有一件事情想请教你
I want to ask your something too

408
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:07,882
什么事？
What?

409
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,068
你的领带在哪里买的？
Where did you buy your tie?

410
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,221
我还真的不知道
I don't know where it came from

411
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,000
我领带全是我太太帮我买的
My wife buys all my ties

412
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:19,545
是吗？
Really?

413
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:26,516
我想起来了，有一次她公司派她出去
She bought this one

414
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,506
回来送给我的
on a business trip abroad

415
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:29,769
她说香港没有卖的
It's not on sale here

416
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:32,867
倒有这么巧
What a coincidence

417
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:36,790
是啊
Yes

418
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:43,689
其实
Actually

419
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:49,041
我先生也有条领带跟你的一模一样
My husband has one just like it

420
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:52,582
他说是他老板送他的
He said it was a gift from his boss

421
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,738
所以天天戴着
So he wears it every day

422
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:02,249
我太太也有个皮包跟你那个一模一样
Any my wife has a bag just like yours

423
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,661
我知道，我见过
I know, I have seen it

424
00:30:09,164 --> 00:30:10,319
你想说什么
What are you getting at, actually?

425
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,006
我还以为只有我一个人知道
I thought I was the only one who knew

426
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:46,133
不知道他们是怎样开始的
I wonder how it began

427
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:06,068
你这么晚不回家，你老婆不说你吗？
It's late, won't your wife complain?

428
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,895
早习惯了，她不管我的
She's used to it, she doesn't care

429
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:14,000
你呢？你老公不说什么吗？
And your husband?

430
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:16,273
我想他早睡了
He must be asleep by now

431
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:21,833
今晚别回去了
Shall we stay out tonight?

432
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,290
我老公不会这样讲的
My husband would never say that

433
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:35,868
他会怎么讲
What would he say?

434
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:38,265
就是不会讲
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that

435
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,394
总有一个人先开口吧
Someone must have made the first move

436
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:44,147
不是他是谁？
Who else could it be?

437
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,738
你这么晚不回家，你老婆不会问吗？
It's late, won't your wife complain?

438
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:55,883
早习惯了，她不管的
She's used to it, she doesn't care

439
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:58,800
你老公不会说什么吗？
And your husband?

440
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:01,550
我想他早睡了
He must be asleep by now

441
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:24,900
我真的说不出口
I can't say it

442
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,796
我明白
I understand

443
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,300
事到如今
After all, it's already happened

444
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:37,527
谁先开口有什么所谓
It doesn't matter who made the first move

445
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,585
其实你知不知道你老婆是怎样的人
Do you really know your wife?

446
00:33:15,055 --> 00:33:16,300
你帮我点
You order for me

447
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:17,833
为什么？
Why?

448
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,776
我想知道你老婆喜欢吃什么
I've no idea what your wife likes

449
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:36,241
那么你丈夫喜欢吃什么
What about your husband?

450
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,212
吃得惯吗？
Like it hot?

451
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,912
你老婆挺能吃辣的
Your wife likes hot dishes

452
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,732
为什么打电话到我公司？
Why did you call me at the office today?

453
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,700
没事做，想听听你的声音
I had nothing to do, I want to hear your voice

454
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:10,521
学得倒挺像我老公
You have my husband down pat

455
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:12,162
油嘴滑舌
He's real sweet-talker

456
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:41,145
你为什么不打电话给我？
Why didn't you call me today?

457
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:43,952
怕你会不高兴
I was afraid you won't like it

458
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:48,116
那么以后不要再打电话给我
Then don't call me again

459
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:08,664
陈太太，陈先生有封信来了，你看看
Mrs. Chan, a letter from your husband

460
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:12,162
不是我的，是隔壁周先生的
It's not for me, it's for Mr.Chow next door

461
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:14,778
我看见信封上的日本邮票
The Japanese stamp made me think

462
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:16,374
以为是陈先生寄来
it was your husband

463
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:18,687
原来不是
So I was wrong

464
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:36,866
你老婆去了日本？
Your wife's in Japan?

465
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:40,383
你怎么知道
How did you know?

466
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,279
信里写些什么？
What did she say in her letter?

467
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:46,385
没什么
Nothing special

468
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,265
有没有说几时回来？
Anything about when she'd be back?

469
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,354
没有
No

470
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,373
你猜他们现在在做什么？
What do you think they're doing right now?

471
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,346
- 你没事吧？ - 没事
Are you alright? I'm fine

472
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:38,273
麻烦你在前面停停车
Please pull up here

473
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:39,999
干什么？
Why?

474
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:41,992
我先下车
I'll get off first

475
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:44,907
不好，我先下
No, let me

476
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:50,482
- 陈太太 - 炳哥，你回来了？
Mrs. Chan Ah Ping, you're back

477
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:52,211
- 是啊 - 找周先生？
Visiting Mr.Chow?

478
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:55,164
想找他喝茶，哪知道他病了
Yes, I thought we'd have lunch but he isn't well

479
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:56,361
怎么回事？
What's wrong with him?

480
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,755
发烧，他老婆又不在家
He's got fever, he's all alone

481
00:38:58,823 --> 00:39:01,903
一个人怪可怜的，下去给他买点什么吃
So I'm gonna buy him something to eat

482
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:03,832
街口那家店，卖的粥挺好的
The congee downstairs is quite good

483
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,213
他不想吃粥
He doesn't want congee

484
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:06,992
他想吃什么
What does he want?

485
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:09,876
他说嘴里淡得慌，想吃芝麻糊
Can't taste anything, so he wants sesame syrup

486
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:11,124
真难缠
Damned troublesome

487
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,161
王妈，王妈
Amah

488
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,997
孙太太，王妈上天台晾衣服去了
Mrs. Suen, she's hanging the washing on the roof

489
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:23,275
你回来了
You're back

490
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:24,993
这是刚上街回来？
Yes, you've been out?

491
00:39:25,122 --> 00:39:28,619
是呀，下礼拜我妈过生日
My mother's birthday is coming up

492
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:30,707
我带她去买点布料做新衣
So I took her to buy some fabric

493
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,774
跑了一整天，气都喘不上来了
It took all day, I'm half dead

494
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:35,792
顺道烫了个头发，好看吗？
And I had my hair done, is it nice?

495
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:36,722
很漂亮
Very nice

496
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:38,535
你在煮什么？
What are you cooking?

497
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,527
忽然想吃芝麻糊
I had a sudden craving for sesame syrup

498
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:45,017
一大锅你怎么吃呀
That whole pot is for you

499
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:48,002
反正煮了，大家一块吃吧
I thought I might as well make a potful

500
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,461
你真客气
You're so thoughtful

501
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:53,997
- 来一碗吧 - 好啊
Please try it I'll

502
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:55,497
这么巧
What a coincidence

503
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,135
是啊，上街吗？
Going out?

504
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:00,997
整晚没吃过东西了，下来吃碗面
I'll buy some noodles, I'm starving

505
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,218
你饿不饿？一起啊？
Hungary? Will you join me?

506
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:04,729
不了
No thanks

507
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,116
这么晚才下班？
Just off work?

508
00:40:07,593 --> 00:40:08,784
公司很忙？
You must be very busy

509
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:12,812
就是没事做，所以看了场电影
Actually, I've been to see a picture

510
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,349
是吗，好不好看？
Really? How was it?

511
00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:17,109
马马虎虎
So-so

512
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,935
我从前也爱看电影
I used to like going to the pictures

513
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:21,367
你以前倒是挺多嗜好的
You had many hobbies before

514
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:25,173
自己一个人，大把时间， 想做什么就做什么
On your own, you are free to do lots of things

515
00:40:25,669 --> 00:40:27,274
结了婚就不一样
Everything changes when you marry

516
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:29,672
很多事情，一个人作不了主
It must be decided together

517
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,165
对不对？
Right?

518
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:36,000
有时候我会想，要是现在还没有结婚
I sometimes wonder what I'd be

519
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:36,992
不知会怎样
if I hadn't married

520
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:38,897
你也会这样想吗？
Have you ever thought of that?

521
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,835
可能会比较开心吧
Maybe happier

522
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:48,731
我以前都没有想到婚姻
I didn't know married life would be

523
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:50,233
是这样复杂
so complicated

524
00:40:52,192 --> 00:40:55,300
如果一个人，自己做得好就够了
When you're single, you are only responsible to yourself

525
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,519
可是当两个人在一起时
Once you're married

526
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:01,142
只有自己做得好是不够的
doing well on your own is not enough

527
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,999
别想太多了，等他们回来再说吧
Don't brood on it, maybe he'll be back soon

528
00:41:12,113 --> 00:41:13,082
你没事啊？
What about you?

529
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:15,111
其实我跟你还不是一样
Actually, we're in the same boat

530
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:19,991
我只是不去想
But I don't brood on it

531
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:22,899
又不是我做错
It's not my fault

532
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:26,151
何必每天问自己做错了什么
I can't waste time wondering if I made mistakes

533
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:28,423
浪费自己时间
Life's too short for that

534
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,544
我不想这样下去
Something must change

535
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,764
你有什么打算？
So what's your plan?

536
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:39,250
这几天我躺在床上翻武侠小说
I want to write a martial-arts

537
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,270
我想再写
serial...

538
00:41:40,418 --> 00:41:43,588
已经开了头，过两天让你看
Actually, I've started one, I'll show it to you

539
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:45,545
好啊
Great

540
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:47,950
你这么喜欢看武侠小说
You like them too

541
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
我们一起写吧
so why not help me write it?

542
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:53,129
这怎么行，我只会看，哪里会写
I wouldn't know how, I only read them

543
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,935
试试看嘛
We would discuss it together

544
00:41:57,206 --> 00:41:58,680
那好吧，我尽量
Alright, I'll try my best

545
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:02,000
还没多谢你的芝麻糊呢
I never thanked you for the sesame syrup

546
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:06,158
别客气，小意思嘛
There's no need I was making it anyway

547
00:42:07,217 --> 00:42:08,750
说起来真巧
Amazing, I was craving for some

548
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,943
刚好那天我很想吃芝麻糊
sesame syrup that day

549
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:13,190
是吗，这么巧
Really? What's a coincidence

550
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:15,524
是呀，就这么巧
It really was

551
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:18,889
我先去吃点东西
I'll go for those noodles

552
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,120
老是这样子，酒席吃到一半就醉倒
Again, halfway through dinner, he's drunk

553
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,555
真讨厌
Disgusting

554
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:55,677
- 早说别给他喝了 - 我有啥办法
- I told you to stop - What can you do?

555
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:01,555
是我
It's me

556
00:45:02,252 --> 00:45:03,368
吓死我了
You scared me

557
00:45:04,006 --> 00:45:05,241
怎样？顾先生有没有事？
How's Mr.Koo?

558
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:07,004
喝醉了吧
Drunk, as usual

559
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:17,891
怎会这样早
I didn't expect them back so early

560
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:23,770
反正没法子，不如先把面吃完再说
Since you're trapped here, finish the noodles

561
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:28,933
我想他们坐一会儿就走
They'll probably go soon

562
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,610
加点汤吗？
Want some soup?

563
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,421
要不要加点汤？
Want some soup?

564
00:45:57,983 --> 00:46:00,599
孙太太，怎么在这边打麻将？
Mrs. Suen, playing here tonight

565
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,981
顾太太说要看着她先生嘛
Yes, Mrs. Koo is dealing with her husband

566
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:07,315
早跟我说嘛，我来照顾他就行了
I could do that

567
00:46:07,443 --> 00:46:08,932
怎好意思呀
No, we should not trouble you

568
00:46:11,173 --> 00:46:12,926
这样高兴，看来要玩到天亮
Think you'll play all night?

569
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,378
才不会，顶多八圈
No, we'll just play eight rounds

570
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,583
你猜他们会不会打到天亮？
They'll play till morning?

571
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:24,927
孙太太说只打八圈
Mrs. Suen says only eight rounds

572
00:46:26,169 --> 00:46:27,258
你信不信？
You believe that?

573
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,728
不如你瞌睡一会，他们散了我就叫你
You get some rest, I'll wake you when they leave

574
00:46:37,982 --> 00:46:38,778
那你呢？
And you?

575
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:40,658
我先把这段写好
I have a chapter to finish

576
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:56,113
写到哪儿？
Where have you got to?

577
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:57,949
大醉侠出场
The drunken master just showed up

578
00:46:58,547 --> 00:47:00,282
怎么多了个大醉侠？
When did he get written in?

579
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:02,707
刚想到的
Just now

580
00:47:26,308 --> 00:47:28,480
周先生，这样早就出去啊
Mr.Chow, home so early?

581
00:47:28,694 --> 00:47:30,373
我下去买点吃的
I went out to buy some food

582
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,616
你今天不用上班吗？
No work today?

583
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:33,459
有点不太舒服，告了一天假
I didn't feel so good, I'm staying home

584
00:47:33,594 --> 00:47:35,669
不舒服还吃这么多糯米鸡
A sick man shouldn't eat all that sticky rice

585
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:37,704
省得晚上再出去买
Some of it's for later

586
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,809
当心吃撑了
Don't stuff yourself

587
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:41,326
周先生
Good morning

588
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:42,943
你早，散场了吗，孙太太？
Good morning, finished your game?

589
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:46,766
没有呢，杨先生要办公，让他先走了
Not yet, but Mr.Yang has to work

590
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,823
不过蔡先生马上就来
Mr.Tsai is coming to replace him

591
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:51,879
有没有帮我打电话回公司请假？
Did you call the office for me?

592
00:47:52,898 --> 00:47:53,689
打过了
Yes

593
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:54,766
你怎么说的
What did you tell them?

594
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:56,747
说你病了
That you weren't feeling well

595
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:00,209
他们有没有问你是谁
Did them ask who you were?

596
00:48:00,805 --> 00:48:01,623
没有
No

597
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:06,657
多半以为我是你丈夫吧
Probably took me for your husband

598
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:10,127
何先生知道他出门了
Mr.Ho knows that he's away

599
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,701
就说他已经回来好了
Pretend he's come back

600
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:23,176
都是自己吓自己
Maybe we're being too cautious?

601
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:25,346
平日我也常过来
I'm always round anyway

602
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:27,184
有什么好紧张的
We shouldn't have panicked

603
00:48:29,718 --> 00:48:32,832
这很难说，他们突然之间回来
Well, they did turn up without warning

604
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:34,451
不知道他们会怎么乱想
What would they assume?

605
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,600
所以真的不能走错一步
We can't put a foot wrong

606
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:20,524
走吧
You can go

607
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:48,400
- 王妈 - 陈太太，怎么这样晚？
Amah Mrs. Chan, you're back very late

608
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:50,640
是呀，今天公司事情多
I had a lot of work today

609
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:53,548
怎么今早没看见你上班？
I didn't see you leave this morning

610
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:55,863
今天很早约了妈妈喝茶
I had breakfast with my mother

611
00:49:55,903 --> 00:49:57,558
我出去的时候你还没来
You weren't here when I left

612
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:00,580
孙太太呢？
Where's Mrs. Suen?

613
00:50:00,995 --> 00:50:04,292
她搓麻将搓到天亮，才刚睡
Asleep, she played mahjong all day

614
00:50:04,303 --> 00:50:06,595
- 别吵她了 - 好的
Be quiet, don't wake her Alright

615
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:09,300
呀，陈太太，你的脚还好吧
Mrs. Chan, is your leg alright?

616
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,615
没什么，新鞋子太窄，挤脚了
It's these new shoes

617
00:50:57,569 --> 00:50:59,241
干嘛请我吃饭？
Why a special dinner tonight?

618
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:03,090
今天出稿费，你那一份你又不收
Since you won't take your share of

619
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,460
只好请你吃饭了
the writing fee

620
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:06,692
其实不关我的事
None of my business

621
00:51:06,762 --> 00:51:08,256
我在旁边打打边鼓而已
All I did was give you some thoughts

622
00:51:09,683 --> 00:51:11,102
我也许会多写一家报纸
Someone else is asking for a serial too

623
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,429
今天有人打电话来约稿
There'll be more work soon

624
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:16,336
是吗？那太好了
Really? So quickly

625
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:17,521
你应付得了吗？
Isn't the workload too much?

626
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,699
所以想找一个地方
That's why I'm looking for a new place

627
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:22,331
做什么？
What for?

628
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:24,855
写东西
To write in

629
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:28,146
这样你以后上来都方便点嘛
lt'll be more convenient

630
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:30,761
虽然我们之间没什么
There's nothing between us

631
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:32,794
但是我不想别人误会你
but I don't want gossip

632
00:51:34,706 --> 00:51:35,997
你觉得怎样？
What do you think?

633
00:51:37,536 --> 00:51:39,455
太浪费了
Why waste money?

634
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:41,950
其实都是你自己写的
You don't need me

635
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:44,270
何必多此一举呢
you can write on your own

636
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:25,965
喂，找谁呀？
Who do you want?

637
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:27,576
周慕云？
Chow Mo-Wan?

638
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,792
他没上班好几天了
He hasn't been in for several days

639
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,349
我们也到处在找他
We're looking for him too

640
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:39,554
你是哪位啊？
May I know who's calling?

641
00:52:42,466 --> 00:52:43,815
要留个话吗？
Any message?

642
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:47,861
哦，不用谢，多挂来啊
It's no trouble, goodbye

643
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:02,525
这文件马上送去会计部
Please get this to Accounts

644
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:04,520
还有，冷气机明天叫人来看看
And have the air-conditioner serviced tomorrow

645
00:53:05,326 --> 00:53:06,402
好，何先生
Mr.Ho

646
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,000
没什么事了，你可以走了
No need to stay if everything's done

647
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:12,104
- 门我来锁喽 - 好的
I'll lock up Yes

648
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:24,410
喂
Hello?

649
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:31,858
你在哪里啊？
Where are you?

650
00:54:36,228 --> 00:54:37,604
我明天再来看你
I'll come again tomorrow

651
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,292
我歇两天就没事
No need, I'll be alright after some rest

652
00:54:41,873 --> 00:54:43,692
不要紧，才一会儿功夫
It's no trouble

653
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:46,621
我给你买点吃的，你想吃什么
I'll bring you some food, what would you like?

654
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,316
随便
Whatever

655
00:54:49,154 --> 00:54:52,190
那我就走了，你早点休息
Then I'll leave now, get some rest

656
00:54:52,518 --> 00:54:53,953
回去给我个电话
Call me when you get home

657
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:57,520
用不着说话，响三声就好
Let it ring three times then hang up

658
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,799
好
Alright

659
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:08,326
我没想过你会来
I didn't think you'd come

660
00:55:12,558 --> 00:55:14,482
我们不会跟他们一样的
We won't be like them

661
00:55:16,737 --> 00:55:17,510
明天见
See you tomorrow

662
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:35,610
你老实告诉我
Tell me honestly

663
00:57:38,262 --> 00:57:39,977
你外面是不是有个女人？
Do you have a mistress?

664
00:57:42,987 --> 00:57:43,997
神经病
You're crazy

665
00:57:47,362 --> 00:57:48,517
谁跟你说的
Who told you I had?

666
00:57:49,124 --> 00:57:50,334
你别管
Never mind who

667
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:53,110
你是不是有了个女人
Do you or don't you?

668
00:57:56,144 --> 00:57:56,933
没有
No

669
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:04,146
不要骗我
Don't lie

670
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:10,243
你看着我，你看着我
Look at me

671
00:58:12,509 --> 00:58:14,620
我问你，你外面是不是有个女人？
I'm asking you, do you have a mistress

672
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,580
是
Yes

673
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:28,191
你怎么了？
That's no reaction

674
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:31,949
他已经承认在外面有个女人
If he admits it outright

675
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:34,511
你还打得这么轻
let him have it

676
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:39,750
我没想到他会回答得这样干脆
I wasn't expecting he would admit it so easily

677
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,183
我不知道该怎么办
I didn't know how to react

678
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:47,128
再来一次吧
One more time, alright?

679
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:06,918
你老实回答我
Tell me frankly

680
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,708
你外面是不是有个女人？
Do you have a mistress?

681
00:59:13,899 --> 00:59:14,775
神经病
You're crazy

682
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:21,773
谁跟你说的？
Who told you that?

683
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:26,997
你别管，你是不是有个女人？
Never mind that, do you or don't you?

684
00:59:32,684 --> 00:59:33,480
没有
No

685
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:37,696
你不要骗我
Don't lie

686
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:39,636
你告诉我
Tell me

687
00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:44,681
你看着我，是不是有个女人？
Look at me, do you have a mistress?

688
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,476
是
Yes

689
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,229
你没事吧
Are you alright?

690
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,440
我没想到真的会这样伤心
I didn't expect it to hurt so much

691
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:42,267
我试试而已，又不是真的
This is just a rehearsal

692
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:46,527
就算是真的他也不会认
He won't really admit it so readily

693
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:51,181
没事的，别这样
It's alright, don't take it so hard

694
01:00:56,174 --> 01:00:57,463
你最近好像应酬挺多的？
You've been out a lot lately

695
01:00:58,387 --> 01:00:59,342
是啊
Yes

696
01:01:02,018 --> 01:01:05,328
年纪轻呢，出去散散心是应该的
It's right to enjoy yourself while you're young

697
01:01:06,694 --> 01:01:07,763
不过得有分寸
But don't overdo it

698
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:12,768
你先生几时回来？
When will your husband be back?

699
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:14,988
他快回来了
Soon

700
01:01:17,556 --> 01:01:21,000
等他回来呢，别再让他老出门
In future, don't let him travel so much

701
01:01:22,014 --> 01:01:24,926
两夫妻经常分开呢，总不大好
A couple should spend time together

702
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,379
你说对吗？
Don't you agree?

703
01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:31,123
晚安
Good night

704
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:54,108
你今天晚上过不过来？
Will you come over tonight?

705
01:01:55,126 --> 01:01:55,922
做什么？
What for?

706
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,465
这两天给催稿，说我写得慢
The editor's hounding me, he says I'm too slow

707
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:01,261
过来帮忙手啊？你几点可以？
I need your help, when can you come?

708
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:04,810
我想这阵子我不过来了
Not anytime soon

709
01:02:05,563 --> 01:02:06,552
怎么了？
Why not?

710
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:09,991
昨晚回家，让孙太太说了几句
Mrs. Suen lectured me last night

711
01:02:11,073 --> 01:02:11,864
她说你什么
What did he say?

712
01:02:12,785 --> 01:02:13,661
我不想讲
Rather not say

713
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,741
反正这阵子我们还是少点见面吧
We shouldn't see so much of each other

714
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,715
陈太太，又要去买面啊？
Mrs. Chan, going out for noodles again?

715
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:32,206
今天不去了
Not tonight, I'll make myself something

716
01:02:33,156 --> 01:02:34,509
随便弄点什么吃的就算了
Join us, we're having vegetable won-tons

717
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:43,546
那好的
Alright

718
01:05:15,294 --> 01:05:17,203
- 何先生没出去吃午饭？ - 没有
- No lunch today, Mr.Ho? - No

719
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:20,657
刚才有位周先生打电话找你
Now one Mr.Zhou call you

720
01:05:21,571 --> 01:05:22,626
叫你回电话给他
He wants you to call him back

721
01:05:26,498 --> 01:05:27,333
谢谢
Thank you

722
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,149
- 下班啦？ - 是呀
- Back from work? - Yes

723
01:06:04,402 --> 01:06:06,911
- 这真是大雨呀 - 是呀
- Strange weather Isn't it - Yes

724
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,576
在这儿站很久了？
Been here long?

725
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:10,071
一会儿罢了
Just a while

726
01:06:13,252 --> 01:06:14,287
我想还得下好一会儿
I don't think it'll stop soon

727
01:06:17,302 --> 01:06:18,132
你等等我
Wait for me

728
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:48,063
我送你回去
I'll see you home

729
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,357
让人看见，又话多了
We'd better not be seen together

730
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:55,438
那么你先回去
Then you go first

731
01:06:58,295 --> 01:06:59,564
他们认得你的伞
If they see your umbrella

732
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:02,611
我撑着回去，不也一样？
They'll know I was with you

733
01:07:04,974 --> 01:07:06,327
这也是，我倒没想到
I wasn't thinking

734
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,343
你先回去吧，我待一会儿就回
You go first, I'll wait a while

735
01:07:15,368 --> 01:07:16,323
我陪你
I'll keep you company

736
01:07:39,338 --> 01:07:40,214
你找过我？
Did you try to call me?

737
01:07:43,012 --> 01:07:44,604
还以为你同事忘了告诉你
I wasn't sure you got the message

738
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:47,428
想找你买张船票
Could you get me a boat ticker?

739
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:51,682
你要去别的地方？
To where?

740
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:54,812
阿炳来过很多信
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore

741
01:07:56,453 --> 01:07:59,809
说那边缺人手，要我去帮他忙
They're short of staff, he'd like me to go and help

742
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:05,127
打算去多久？
How long will you stay?

743
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:08,291
不知道，去了再说吧
Don't know, I'll play it be ear

744
01:08:13,777 --> 01:08:15,654
怎么突然会想去新加坡？
Why rush off to Singapore?

745
01:08:17,785 --> 01:08:18,695
想换―下环境
A change of scene...

746
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,674
免得听着太多的闲言闲语
I've had enough of the gossip

747
01:08:25,132 --> 01:08:27,009
我们自己知道我们没什么不就行了
We know it's not true, so why worry?

748
01:08:31,227 --> 01:08:32,262
原来我也这样想
I used to think that too

749
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,284
所以不怕别人说闲话
and it didn't worry me

750
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:40,549
我相信我自己不会像他们那样
I thought we wouldn't be like them

751
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:46,372
原来会的
But I was wrong

752
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:51,233
我知道你不会离开你丈夫
You won't leave your husband

753
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,705
我想离开一下
So I'd rather go away

754
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:04,994
我没有想过你真的会喜欢我
I didn't think you'd fall in love with me

755
01:09:06,904 --> 01:09:07,893
我也没有想过
I didn't either

756
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:15,769
我一直在想，他们是怎样开始的
I was only curious to know how it started

757
01:09:17,465 --> 01:09:18,500
现在我明白了
Now I know

758
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:22,501
原来很多事情都这样
Feelings can creep up just like that

759
01:09:27,318 --> 01:09:28,328
我还以为自己没有什么
I thought I was in control

760
01:09:29,989 --> 01:09:31,900
但是开始担心你丈夫几时会回来
But I hate to think of our husband coming home

761
01:09:33,454 --> 01:09:34,489
最好不要回来
I wish he'd stay away

762
01:09:36,751 --> 01:09:37,861
我知道这样想不对
I'm so bad

763
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,166
你能不能帮我一个忙
Will you do me one favour?

764
01:09:45,184 --> 01:09:46,039
做什么？
What?

765
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:49,096
我想有点心理准备
I want to be prepared

766
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:47,718
以后不要再找我了
You'd better not see me again

767
01:10:53,312 --> 01:10:54,627
你老公他回来了？
Is your husband back?

768
01:10:55,942 --> 01:10:56,852
是啊
Yes

769
01:10:59,282 --> 01:11:00,476
我真没用
Am I hopeless?

770
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:04,327
不是啊
Not really

771
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,703
我不会再找你了
I won't see you again

772
01:11:19,445 --> 01:11:20,764
好好地守着你的丈夫
Keep a closer eye on your husband

773
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:02,895
别这样
Please

774
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,538
说了试着的嘛
Don't be serious it's only a rehearsal

775
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:09,534
别哭
Don't cry

776
01:12:14,506 --> 01:12:15,621
这又不是真的
This isn't real

777
01:13:06,604 --> 01:13:08,037
我今天晚上不想回家
I don't want to go home tonight

778
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:37,819
陈美仪点给好朋友权仔和文文
Mei-Yi wants to dedicate a song

779
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:39,529
祝他们成功
to her honeymooning friends

780
01:13:39,866 --> 01:13:41,865
又点给同屋的张太太收听
And Mrs. Cheung wishes the best to

781
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,929
祝家庭幸福
her neighbors

782
01:13:45,384 --> 01:13:47,495
有一位在日本公干的陈先生
And Mr.Chan, now on business in Japan

783
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:50,343
点这首歌给他太太
wants to wish his wife

784
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:53,206
祝她生日快乐，工作顺利
a happy birthday

785
01:13:54,109 --> 01:13:56,745
现在请大家一起欣赏，周璇唱的
So let's all enjoy Zhou Xuan singing

786
01:13:56,948 --> 01:13:58,740
花样的年华
In Full Bloom

787
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:40,634
是我
It's me

788
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:43,804
如果有多一张船票
If there's an extra ticket

789
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,806
你会不会跟我一起走？
Would you go with me?

790
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:16,518
是我
It's me

791
01:18:18,275 --> 01:18:19,424
如果有多一张船票
If there's an extra ticket

792
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:21,925
你会不会带我一起走？
Would you go with me?

793
01:18:36,952 --> 01:18:41,128
哈罗？周先生不在，他上班去了
Mr.Chow has gone to work

794
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:43,682
有话要转达吗？
Any message?

795
01:18:44,992 --> 01:18:47,041
不用谢，拜拜
You're welcome

796
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,151
是不是有人进过我房间？
Has anyone been in my room?

797
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,340
没有呀
No

798
01:19:19,933 --> 01:19:21,343
没有？我丢了东西
Something's missing

799
01:19:21,687 --> 01:19:22,797
丢了什么呀
What?

800
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:56,729
你知不知道，从前的人
In the old days

801
01:19:57,494 --> 01:20:00,831
要是心里有了秘密，不想别人知道
If someone had a secret they didn't want to share

802
01:20:01,544 --> 01:20:02,799
你知不知道他们会怎样做？
You know what they did?

803
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,287
我怎么知道？
Have no idea

804
01:20:09,475 --> 01:20:11,224
他们会跑到山上找一棵树
They went up to a mountain, found a tree

805
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:14,894
在树上挖个洞
Carved a hole in it

806
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:17,603
然后把秘密全说进去
And whispered the secret into the hole

807
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,839
再用泥巴封起来
Then they covered it with mud

808
01:20:22,959 --> 01:20:26,999
那秘密就永远留在那棵树里，没人知道
And leave the secret there forever

809
01:20:29,596 --> 01:20:33,432
这样辛苦，找个女人发泄一下不更好
What a pain, I'd just go to get laid

810
01:20:36,902 --> 01:20:37,891
谁都像你呀
Not everyone's like you

811
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:41,807
说得是呀，像我这样的人
I'm just an average guy

812
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,908
是个直肠子，哪来的心事呀？
I don't have secrets like you

813
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:46,991
你可不同，什么都往心里搁
You bottle things up

814
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,515
说来听听嘛
Tell me something

815
01:20:49,843 --> 01:20:50,719
我哪有心事
I don't have secrets

816
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:55,148
你别瞒我啦，一场朋友
Come off it, buddy

817
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,349
我不会跟别人说的
I won't tell anyone

818
01:23:26,378 --> 01:23:27,554
喂，你好，星洲日报
Hello, Singapore Daily

819
01:23:28,799 --> 01:23:29,675
请等等
Hold on

820
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,139
云哥，电话
Mr.Chow, call for you

821
01:23:33,224 --> 01:23:33,876
谢谢
Thanks

822
01:23:37,248 --> 01:23:38,164
喂
Hello

823
01:23:43,951 --> 01:23:44,834
喂
Hello

824
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:36,572
- 谁呀？ - 王妈，是我啊
- Who is it? - It is me

825
01:24:38,246 --> 01:24:40,596
- 陈太太，好久没见了 - 是呀
- Mrs. Chan, long time no see - Yes

826
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:42,805
- 王妈，什么人呀 - 孙太太
- Amah, who's there? - Mrs. Suen

827
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:45,309
哎呀，你怎么会过来啊？
What brings you here?

828
01:24:45,387 --> 01:24:47,203
我想这么久没来看你
It's been a while

829
01:24:47,397 --> 01:24:48,827
今天刚好来这附近
I was nearby

830
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:50,702
特意把船票给你送来
so I thought I'd bring your boat ticket

831
01:24:51,822 --> 01:24:52,545
请你吃的
And a small gift

832
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:55,742
哎呀，上来坐坐就好了， 还这样客气，又破费
You shouldn't have, it's nice just to see you

833
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,017
你看这屋里乱七八糟的
The place is in such a mess

834
01:24:58,251 --> 01:24:59,122
你已经在收拾了？
Already started packing?

835
01:24:59,545 --> 01:25:01,503
已经收拾好几天了
It's hopeless,

836
01:25:02,049 --> 01:25:05,655
东西太多，有些又舍不得扔
I can't bear to throw things away

837
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:09,456
- 坐的地方都没有，到这边坐 - 好啊
- Let's find you a seat - OK

838
01:25:13,487 --> 01:25:15,037
- 吃茶 - 谢谢，王妈
- Have some tea - Thank you

839
01:25:15,893 --> 01:25:20,452
你今天别走，在这里吃晚饭，我去买菜
Eat with us, Mrs. Chan, I'm going to the market

840
01:25:22,395 --> 01:25:24,870
不行呢，我还得回公司办点事
I can't, I have work waiting

841
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:27,605
你干嘛急着走
Don't rush off

842
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,768
你不留在这儿吃饭
if you don't eat here

843
01:25:30,211 --> 01:25:33,422
太太要不高兴的，太太？
Mrs. Suen will be upset

844
01:25:33,423 --> 01:25:34,926
嗳，你替我倒杯茶来
Amah, pour me some tea too

845
01:25:37,106 --> 01:25:38,300
陈先生好吗？
How's your husband?

846
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,000
挺好的，有心了
He's fine, thank you

847
01:25:40,964 --> 01:25:42,000
你打算走多久？
How long will you be away?

848
01:25:43,193 --> 01:25:44,248
我也不晓得
I don't know

849
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:46,692
要是住的惯呢我就不回来了
If I like it, I might stay

850
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:48,733
为什么？
Why?

851
01:25:48,988 --> 01:25:51,838
我女儿说现在香港这么乱
My daughter worries about the situation in Hong Kong

852
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:54,496
我自己一个人在这边她不放心
She worry about I stay alone in Hong Kong

853
01:25:54,591 --> 01:25:57,752
我倒是舍不得离开香港的
I don't want to leave

854
01:25:57,788 --> 01:26:00,743
不过自从顾先生他们搬走了以后
Since the Koos left

855
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:04,111
搓麻将也没搭伴
I don't have my mahjong partners anymore

856
01:26:04,642 --> 01:26:10,221
想想呢，还是到美国去给女儿带孩子算了
And my daughter needs help with her kids in the US

857
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:15,041
这房子怎么办？
What about this place?

858
01:26:15,664 --> 01:26:18,117
正为了这个伤脑筋嘛
I'm not sure

859
01:26:20,003 --> 01:26:21,777
卖出去呢真不舍得
I don't want to sell it

860
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:25,403
想想还是租给人家吧
So I might rent it out

861
01:26:26,259 --> 01:26:27,998
你打算租多少钱？
How much would you want?

862
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:31,318
嗳？你有意思租吗？
You're interested?

863
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:36,256
租给你我可就放心了， 我便宜点租给你啦
You could have it at a discount

864
01:26:36,869 --> 01:26:37,687
我想想看
I'll think about it

865
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:39,315
太太，吃茶
Mrs. Suen, your tea

866
01:26:41,251 --> 01:26:43,708
对了，现在是什么人住在隔壁？
Who lives next door now?

867
01:26:44,101 --> 01:26:48,591
我也不大晓得，不像以前，都没往来
I don't really know them

868
01:26:48,726 --> 01:26:54,857
以前跟顾先生顾太太不知多热闹
The Koos were almost like family

869
01:26:54,888 --> 01:27:00,027
像一家人一样，想起来也开心
It was so nice then

870
01:27:00,205 --> 01:27:01,535
你说是吗？
wasn't it?

871
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:03,174
是啊
Yes

872
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:06,085
过来这边坐
Let's sit over here

873
01:27:33,001 --> 01:27:33,592
你找哪位？
Yes?

874
01:27:34,378 --> 01:27:35,288
请问顾先生在不在？
Is Mr.Koo in?

875
01:27:35,882 --> 01:27:37,952
顾先生？搬了好久了
He moved long ago

876
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,169
知不知道搬到哪儿去了？
Do you know where he is?

877
01:27:41,767 --> 01:27:42,597
你跟他很熟吗？
You know him well?

878
01:27:44,105 --> 01:27:45,015
我从前住在这里
I used to live here

879
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,990
孙太太还住在隔壁吗？
Is Mrs. Suen still next door?

880
01:27:49,031 --> 01:27:51,640
也搬了，现在乱成这样
She's gone, it's too chaotic

881
01:27:52,396 --> 01:27:53,895
能走的还不走吗？
Everyone's running away

882
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,152
现在隔壁住着什么人？
So who lives there now?

883
01:27:57,212 --> 01:27:58,281
我也不太清楚
I am not sure

884
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:00,582
好像就是一个女人带着她儿子
A woman and her son

885
01:28:01,889 --> 01:28:03,317
那小孩子蛮可爱的
The kid is cute

886
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:08,607
他菲律宾的地址我没找着
No address in the Philippines

887
01:28:09,736 --> 01:28:10,871
只有他儿子的电话
Just his son's phone number

888
01:28:12,325 --> 01:28:14,316
- 你拿回去 - 这怎行
- I can't accept this - How this

889
01:28:14,954 --> 01:28:15,989
小意思，不客气
Please, you must

890
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:20,534
- 那么谢谢了 - 慢走
- Thank you, then - Bye

891
01:28:31,571 --> 01:28:32,897
那个时代已过去
That era has passed

892
01:28:32,897 --> 01:28:35,071
属于那个时代的一切
Nothing that belonged to

893
01:28:35,071 --> 01:28:36,385
都不存在了
it exists any more

894
01:28:37,538 --> 01:28:38,632
庸生，好了没？
Are you ready?

895
01:28:39,059 --> 01:28:40,498
- 好了 - 快点
- Okay - Let's go

896
01:28:57,209 --> 01:29:01,621
柬埔寨首都机场上
The presidential corps waits at Pochentong Airport

897
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:06,547
皇室人员上前
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Queen sisowath Kossamak

898
01:29:06,594 --> 01:29:08,590
迎接戴高乐将军
come forward to greet General De Gaulle

899
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:21,185
公路上列队欢迎
It's ten kilometres from Pochentong to Phnom Penh

900
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:24,480
人潮达二十万人
200,000 people line the route

901
01:29:24,665 --> 01:29:27,210
写下该国前所未有的一页
A welcome unprecedented in the history of the Kingdom
