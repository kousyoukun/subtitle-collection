Yes, l did.

Thank you.

Not that room!

44
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:03,766
Oops, wrong again!

45
00:02:07,208 --> 00:02:09,278
Careful! Against the wall there.

46
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:16,327
The little cupboard over there.

47
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:17,683
Be careful!

48
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:20,166
Don't break anything!

49
00:02:20,488 --> 00:02:22,285
Not on top of the radio!

50
00:02:22,968 --> 00:02:23,878
Mr Chow...

51
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:26,477
You have a lot of stuff
for a couple!

52
00:02:26,728 --> 00:02:28,844
- The wardrobe isn't mine.
- Wrong again?

53
00:02:29,048 --> 00:02:30,003
lt goes next door.

54
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,039
Okay, next door.

55
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:36,322
These aren't my shoes!
They must go next door.

56
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:41,201
What a coincidence!
Moving in on the same day!

57
00:02:41,768 --> 00:02:43,201
ls Mr Chan here?

58
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,446
He's working abroad.
He'll be back next week.

59
00:02:46,888 --> 00:02:48,799
You should have waited, then.

60
00:02:49,408 --> 00:02:51,842
lt's too much for you on your own.

61
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,563
- l can manage.
- l'll ask Amah to help.

62
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:56,440
No need, l can manage.

63
00:02:56,648 --> 00:02:58,127
What's going on?

64
00:02:59,328 --> 00:03:00,317
Mind that mirror!

65
00:03:00,528 --> 00:03:02,484
Mrs Chan, l'll leave you to it.

66
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:10,884
- Those books aren't mine.
- Wrong again?

67
00:03:11,088 --> 00:03:12,567
Never mind,
just leave them there.

68
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,278
Mind how you hang the mirror,
it's fragile!

69
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:17,126
Are these magazines yours?

70
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:19,846
Yes, they're my husband's.

71
00:03:20,288 --> 00:03:21,721
He reads Japanese?

72
00:03:21,928 --> 00:03:23,964
A little, his boss is Japanese.

73
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:25,567
How should l address you?

74
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:26,803
My husband's name is Chan.

75
00:03:27,048 --> 00:03:28,561
My name's Chow...
l'll leave you in peace.

76
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,003
Thank you, Mr Chow.

77
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,436
Don't mention it.

78
00:03:34,008 --> 00:03:35,441
l'll ask Mrs Chan...

79
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:40,483
Mrs Chan,
eat with us before you go!

80
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,879
No thanks,
l must dash to the airport.

81
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:45,397
- Your husband's coming back?
- Yes.

82
00:03:45,608 --> 00:03:47,200
Then l won't keep you.

83
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:50,680
- Going out?
- Yes.

84
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:54,283
Sorry, l'm late!

85
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:55,677
Amah, pour some beer.

86
00:03:57,608 --> 00:03:58,518
Cheers!

87
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:02,966
Mrs Chow,
try some Shanghai dishes.

88
00:04:03,208 --> 00:04:06,006
Where is Mrs Chan off to so late?

89
00:04:07,408 --> 00:04:09,797
Meeting her husband at the airport.

90
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,805
So that's why she looks different.

91
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:10,442
lt's all packed,
take care on your trip.

92
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:11,916

93
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,408

Two to four weeks.

95
00:05:20,248 --> 00:05:24,287
Remember to bring back
two more of those handbags.

96
00:05:24,528 --> 00:05:25,438
Who for?

97
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:26,558
My boss.

98
00:05:26,768 --> 00:05:28,042
Two of them?

99
00:05:28,248 --> 00:05:29,601
You know why.

100
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:31,605
Different colors?

101
00:05:32,848 --> 00:05:35,078
The same will do! Who cares?

102
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:37,156
Whatever!

103
00:05:47,608 --> 00:05:52,636
Mrs Ho.
Mr Ho is still in a meeting.

104
00:05:52,848 --> 00:05:55,840
He'll be home late...
Please don't wait to eat.

105
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,838
Yes, we're so busy at the moment.

106
00:06:01,968 --> 00:06:05,756
Yes, l'll ask him to call you
when he gets back.

107
00:06:13,528 --> 00:06:15,086
Did you call my wife?

108
00:06:15,288 --> 00:06:17,802
Yes, l said you'd be back later.

109
00:06:18,488 --> 00:06:21,127
- Have you booked the restaurant?
- A table for two at eight.

110
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:24,366
Miss Yu called
to say she's on her way.

111
00:06:25,248 --> 00:06:29,446
l'll be back after dinner,
can l bring you something?

112
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:31,764
No thanks, l'll get my own.

113
00:06:32,928 --> 00:06:36,967
Leave when you're ready,
l'll lock up.

114
00:06:41,088 --> 00:06:43,158
- Good evening, Mr Ho!
- Evening!

115
00:07:01,008 --> 00:07:03,203
- Going out, Mrs Chan?
- Yes.

116
00:07:07,608 --> 00:07:08,882
Going out so late?

117
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:10,760
Just getting some noodles.

118
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:13,477
Amah is making pork soup, join us.

119
00:07:13,688 --> 00:07:16,486
Thanks, l'm not really hungry,
l just want some air.

120
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:18,560
You're too polite.

121
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:20,127
Next time!

122
00:07:23,048 --> 00:07:26,438
They're all starving, we can eat.

123
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,206
Have you spoken to Ming?

124
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:33,678
So l'll go with someone else!

125
00:07:34,888 --> 00:07:36,640
Just kidding!

126
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,960
l'll be early tonight, see you soon!

127
00:07:47,648 --> 00:07:48,763
Chow!

128
00:07:49,008 --> 00:07:49,997
Coming!

129
00:07:56,208 --> 00:08:00,724
Time to go! Finish it tomorrow!

130
00:08:01,128 --> 00:08:03,437
No, l'm nearly there...

131
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:04,882
Oh, Ming...

132
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:08,366
- l need a few days off next month.
- Why?

133
00:08:08,968 --> 00:08:11,846
l promised my wife a trip.
Put in a word for me, will you?

134
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,883
l'll speak to personnel.

135
00:08:15,088 --> 00:08:16,965
But the next lunch is on you.

136
00:08:17,168 --> 00:08:18,203
l will.

137
00:08:18,648 --> 00:08:19,683
Thanks, Ming!

138
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:23,996
lt's ready!

139
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:26,244
No, it'll switch itself off!

140
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:29,479
l told you, it's not ready!

141
00:08:30,808 --> 00:08:33,163
A rice cooker!
lt's yours, Mrs Koo?

142
00:08:33,728 --> 00:08:38,006
No, it's beyond us!
lt's Mrs Chan's.

143
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:42,007
My husband brought it from Japan.

144
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,960
l wanted to show Mrs Koo
how good it is.

145
00:08:44,648 --> 00:08:45,876
Now it's ready!

146
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:46,958
Mrs Chan...

147
00:08:55,928 --> 00:09:00,160
Could Mr Chan get me one
next time?

148
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:01,403
No problem!

149
00:09:01,888 --> 00:09:04,448
Mr Chow, you should get one too!

150
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:08,607
Your wife's so often late home.

151
00:09:10,048 --> 00:09:11,766
l couldn't trouble Mr Chan.

152
00:09:12,008 --> 00:09:14,124
lt's just neighborly, isn't it?

153
00:09:15,328 --> 00:09:18,718
lt's no trouble! l'll ask him
to buy another next time.

154
00:09:19,328 --> 00:09:20,363
Thank you!

155
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,676
Let's try the rice.

156
00:09:33,488 --> 00:09:36,366
Mr Chan, sorry to trouble you
about the rice cooker.

157
00:09:36,568 --> 00:09:38,399
lt was really no trouble.

158
00:09:39,528 --> 00:09:41,883
How much do l owe you?

159
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:44,005
Your wife has already paid me.

160
00:09:44,288 --> 00:09:45,243
Really?

161
00:09:45,448 --> 00:09:46,927
She didn't tell you?

162
00:09:47,448 --> 00:09:48,927
She's been working late shifts.

163
00:09:49,128 --> 00:09:51,164
Often l'm asleep when she gets back.

164
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:52,960
lt must be hard for her.

165
00:09:53,168 --> 00:09:55,762
Yes.
Mrs Chan isn't back yet?

166
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:59,119
She'll be back soon...
You need to talk to her?

167
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:01,639
A friend needs to go to Singapore.

168
00:10:01,848 --> 00:10:04,043
l wonder if she could get
a cheap ticket for him.

169
00:10:04,248 --> 00:10:06,079
l'll ask when she gets back.

170
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:09,039
l'm bothering you too much.

171
00:10:09,248 --> 00:10:12,206
Don't mention it, we're neighbors!

172
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:14,446
l'll leave you in peace.

173
00:10:20,568 --> 00:10:21,717
Looking for me?

174
00:10:22,008 --> 00:10:24,806
Damn right, where've you been?

175
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,597
What's up?

176
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:30,963
Mrs Chan called,
you left a hat at her office.

177
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,881
l meant to!
l wanted an excuse to go back.

178
00:10:34,288 --> 00:10:35,880
l know your tricks!

179
00:10:37,008 --> 00:10:38,407
She's married.

180
00:10:38,648 --> 00:10:40,400
l know, that's why l left.

181
00:10:40,608 --> 00:10:43,520
Otherwise l'd move in next door.

182
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:47,317
lf your wife wasn't so attractive,
she'd be a worried woman!

183
00:10:50,008 --> 00:10:51,680
l'm not like you.

184
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:55,400
Please call Mrs Chan for me.

185
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,680
l'll pick up the hat tomorrow.
And take her to lunch!

186
00:10:59,488 --> 00:11:00,637
Dream on!

187
00:11:00,848 --> 00:11:03,521
She'll take the hat home.
l'll bring it in tomorrow.

188
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,961
You're kidding!
Some buddy you are!

189
00:11:07,168 --> 00:11:09,636
Tell you what,
let's go pick her up now!

190
00:11:10,888 --> 00:11:13,356
She should be off work by now.
We can go together!

191
00:11:13,928 --> 00:11:15,486
l don't have time for this.

192
00:11:15,688 --> 00:11:16,518
Chow!

193
00:11:16,768 --> 00:11:19,202
Yes! Get out of here, l'm busy.

194
00:11:19,448 --> 00:11:22,042
Then l'll wait at your place.

195
00:11:23,688 --> 00:11:24,916
Ping!

196
00:11:32,888 --> 00:11:34,560
Mr Chow, is Mr Koo in?

197
00:11:34,888 --> 00:11:37,561
He's out...
Forgot to buy the paper again?

198
00:11:37,768 --> 00:11:40,282
- That's right, l'll stop by later.
- Maybe l can find it for you.

199
00:11:40,488 --> 00:11:41,967
Thank you.

200
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:53,760
- This one?
- Yes.

201
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:58,324
l always loved those serials,
hated to miss an episode.

202
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,446
Really? You liked them too?

203
00:12:02,328 --> 00:12:04,080
l even thought of writing one!

204
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:05,516
Why didn't you?

205
00:12:05,768 --> 00:12:08,202
l couldn't get started,
so l gave up.

206
00:12:08,408 --> 00:12:10,478
l wasn't born
to write martial arts stories!

207
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:12,804
But you can borrow
from my collection anytime.

208
00:12:13,048 --> 00:12:15,846
Not now, maybe another time.
Thanks.

209
00:12:16,048 --> 00:12:17,561
You're welcome!

210
00:12:24,568 --> 00:12:26,126
What is it? Mrs Chan!

211
00:12:26,808 --> 00:12:28,924
l just want to return these
to Mr Chow. ls he in?

212
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,085
He's been away for a few days.

213
00:12:31,288 --> 00:12:32,403
Why?

214
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:34,366
They had a quarrel.

215
00:12:35,048 --> 00:12:39,200
Leave them with me,
l'll pass them back to him.

216
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,118
Thank you.

217
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,563
Forget it!

218
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,127
l'm on a replacement shift tonight.

219
00:12:56,048 --> 00:12:57,720
Talk to you later.

220
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:03,280
No need to pick me up!

221
00:13:06,008 --> 00:13:07,680
She's already left.

222
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:11,559
Really? l was going
to take her out for supper.

223
00:13:12,088 --> 00:13:14,807
Didn't she tell you
she was off early today?

224
00:13:15,008 --> 00:13:17,602
She never remembers to tell me.

225
00:13:19,488 --> 00:13:21,285
Maybe she's home by now.

226
00:13:22,328 --> 00:13:24,683
- l'll be off, then.
- Okay, bye!

227
00:15:43,288 --> 00:15:44,277
Hello!

228
00:15:56,368 --> 00:15:57,596
You're out of hospital!

229
00:15:57,808 --> 00:16:00,276
Don't mention hospital!
Lend me $30!

230
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:01,603
What for?

231
00:16:01,968 --> 00:16:03,765
You gotta help me save face!

232
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:05,117
What's the big deal?

233
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,681
lt's Ah Hoi's fault.

234
00:16:06,888 --> 00:16:10,039
He gave me a racing tip,
said it was a sure thing.

235
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:14,880
Before they'd taken out
the stitches...

236
00:16:15,088 --> 00:16:17,283
l bet everything l had.

237
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:18,887
And l lost my shirt!

238
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:21,040
What did you expect?

239
00:16:21,768 --> 00:16:23,838
l thought it was my lucky day.

240
00:16:24,048 --> 00:16:25,879
Anyhow, l had only $2 left.

241
00:16:26,368 --> 00:16:29,644
So l went to the whorehouse.

242
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,760
You were in no shape for sex!

243
00:16:31,968 --> 00:16:34,357
l thought it would improve my luck.

244
00:16:35,968 --> 00:16:38,323
What would $2 buy you?

245
00:16:39,328 --> 00:16:42,604
l'm Kwai-fei's regular,
she gives me credit.

246
00:16:43,248 --> 00:16:44,522
You can have it on credit?

247
00:16:44,728 --> 00:16:48,243
l left my lD card and said
l'd be back to redeem it.

248
00:16:48,728 --> 00:16:50,958
l thought a few dollars
would be easy to rustle up.

249
00:16:51,328 --> 00:16:53,319
But so far nothing
l'm way overdue.

250
00:16:53,528 --> 00:16:54,119
So?

251
00:16:54,448 --> 00:16:56,200
Four Eyes was there yesterday.

252
00:16:56,408 --> 00:16:58,683
Saw her waving my lD around
in front of everyone.

253
00:16:58,888 --> 00:16:59,798
So embarrassing!

254
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:01,964
Anyway, lend me $30!

255
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,766
This is all l can spare.

256
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,678
l need $1 0 for myself.

257
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:17,120
Pay you back next month.

258
00:17:17,888 --> 00:17:20,118
- Let's have a late snack.
- What?

259
00:17:20,408 --> 00:17:23,206
All l've had today
is some won-ton noodles.

260
00:17:23,408 --> 00:17:25,364
Let me finish writing this first.

261
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:30,682
l'm not sure
l should tell you this...

262
00:17:31,088 --> 00:17:31,964
What?

263
00:17:32,168 --> 00:17:34,523
l saw your wife
in the street yesterday.

264
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:36,366
So what?

265
00:17:37,728 --> 00:17:40,845
She was with some guy.

266
00:17:45,288 --> 00:17:46,926
Probably a friend.

267
00:17:49,208 --> 00:17:51,483
Just thought you should know.

268
00:17:53,128 --> 00:17:56,086
Miss Yu? This is me.

269
00:17:57,248 --> 00:18:01,002
Mr Ho's still in a meeting.
He says he can't manage dinner.

270
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:04,724
Yes, we're very busy now.

271
00:18:08,648 --> 00:18:09,683
l will.

272
00:18:10,408 --> 00:18:12,239
l'll ask Mr Ho to call.

273
00:18:17,568 --> 00:18:20,128
- Have you called Miss Yu?
- Yes, l have.

274
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:21,557
What did she say?

275
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,724
Asks you to call her later.

276
00:18:23,928 --> 00:18:26,203
And Mrs Ho says she's ready
to cut her birthday cake.

277
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:27,602
She wants you to hurry home.

278
00:18:27,808 --> 00:18:30,197
- Did you get me a present for her?
- Yes, this.

279
00:18:30,408 --> 00:18:32,160
- What is it?
- A scarf.

280
00:18:32,688 --> 00:18:35,566
- l think Mrs Ho will like it.
- Thank you.

281
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,042
And here's your change.

282
00:18:37,248 --> 00:18:40,558
l'm always troubling you,
use it for bus fare.

283
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:43,597
Why don't you dine with us tonight?

284
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:46,806
Thank you, l've already planned
to see a film tonight.

285
00:18:47,008 --> 00:18:48,680
Then l won't keep you.

286
00:18:48,888 --> 00:18:51,880
Tomorrow will be quiet,
take the morning off.

287
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,524
Are you going out tonight?

288
00:19:05,448 --> 00:19:07,086
Don't forget your keys.

289
00:19:07,288 --> 00:19:09,756
All the neighbors
are dining out tonight.

290
00:19:10,088 --> 00:19:13,603
l have a lot to do here,
l'll be late.

291
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,926
What is it, Mrs Chan?

292
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:31,443
l heard voices,

293
00:19:31,648 --> 00:19:33,923
l thought Mr and Mrs Koo
were back.

294
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,927
Not yet, anything l can help with?

295
00:19:38,728 --> 00:19:40,878
No, l just wanted a chat.

296
00:19:42,128 --> 00:19:43,959
- Are you alone?
- Yes, l am.

297
00:19:47,368 --> 00:19:48,960
You're back early today!

298
00:19:49,648 --> 00:19:52,560
l came back to rest.
l'm not feeling well...

299
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:56,882
What is it?
l have some medicines...

300
00:19:57,808 --> 00:20:00,720
Don't trouble yourself,
l'll sleep it off.

301
00:20:02,448 --> 00:20:04,484
ln that case,
l'll leave you in peace.

302
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,327
lt was your wife.

303
00:20:14,648 --> 00:20:16,445
Have you spoken to your wife yet?

304
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:19,326
Then we shouldn't meet any more.

305
00:21:05,088 --> 00:21:06,885
Any news from the Philippines?

306
00:21:07,088 --> 00:21:08,203
Yes, a telex.

307
00:21:08,408 --> 00:21:10,160
There's a typhoon,
so the ship's still docked.

308
00:21:11,048 --> 00:21:15,678
Please inform Chan
that the shipment may be delayed.

309
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,646
Ask if that's a problem.

310
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:23,966
Your wife rang.
You don't need to pick her up.

311
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:25,886
She's playing mahjong with Mrs Lau.

312
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:28,522
She'll meet you
at the restaurant at 5.30.

313
00:21:31,528 --> 00:21:33,166
And there's a gift from Miss Yu.

314
00:21:33,528 --> 00:21:34,597
She was here?

315
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:36,639
No, she had it sent over.

316
00:21:36,848 --> 00:21:40,045
She says she'll dine alone
since it's your birthday.

317
00:21:40,368 --> 00:21:42,836
Please phone her
when you have a moment.

318
00:21:44,648 --> 00:21:47,321
- l'll get you another coffee.
- Thank you.

319
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:10,523
Thank you.

320
00:22:15,848 --> 00:22:17,645
That tie looks good on you.

321
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:22,205
You noticed?
lt's much like the old one.

322
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:26,036
You notice things
if you pay attention.

323
00:22:37,688 --> 00:22:38,803
l'll be off now.

324
00:22:39,008 --> 00:22:42,125
lf Chan has a problem,
let me know at the restaurant.

325
00:22:42,368 --> 00:22:44,324
l will.
Why did you change your tie?

326
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:46,200
The new one was too showy.

327
00:22:46,408 --> 00:22:48,000
l should stick with my own.

328
00:22:48,208 --> 00:22:49,960
Don't forget to lock up.

329
00:24:32,248 --> 00:24:35,240
By the way,
haven't seen your husband lately.

330
00:24:35,928 --> 00:24:38,396
He's abroad now,
on company business.

331
00:24:38,888 --> 00:24:41,686
That's why l see you
at the noodle stall.

332
00:24:42,608 --> 00:24:44,644
l don't like cooking for myself.

333
00:24:45,368 --> 00:24:47,598
Haven't seen your wife
lately either.

334
00:24:48,648 --> 00:24:51,526
Her mother's ill,
she's at home with her.

335
00:24:53,128 --> 00:24:54,766
That explains it.

336
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:56,717
Good night!

337
00:24:57,368 --> 00:24:58,118
Good night!

338
00:24:58,768 --> 00:25:00,520
Mrs Chan, l'm glad you're back!

339
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:02,286
lt's raining so hard!

340
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:04,160
l was going to look for you
with an umbrella.

341
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:05,598
You're too kind.

342
00:25:05,808 --> 00:25:06,923
Amah, who is it?

343
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:08,760
- lt's Mrs Chan.
- Mrs Suen!

344
00:25:09,368 --> 00:25:13,486
Caught in the rain?
l said you could eat with us!

345
00:25:14,328 --> 00:25:16,398
Next time... Enjoy your game.

346
00:25:18,728 --> 00:25:23,244
Her husband's always away.
lt's sad to see her so lonely.

347
00:25:23,448 --> 00:25:27,077
She dresses up like that
to go out for noodles?

348
00:25:37,888 --> 00:25:39,958
Mr Chow!
What are you doing here?

349
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,599
Just calling Mrs Koo to the phone.

350
00:25:43,968 --> 00:25:45,401
You're late back.

351
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:47,405
l went to the pictures.

352
00:25:48,008 --> 00:25:49,566
l'll be going.

353
00:25:56,648 --> 00:25:57,637
Hello?

354
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,960
Yes, please hold on.

355
00:26:00,248 --> 00:26:02,398
- Who is it?
- lt's for Mrs Chan.

356
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:16,562
lt must seem odd to ask you out,
but l want to ask something.

357
00:26:16,928 --> 00:26:18,884
That handbag l saw you with
this evening...

358
00:26:19,088 --> 00:26:20,726
Where did you buy it?

359
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:23,120
Why do you ask?

360
00:26:25,488 --> 00:26:28,844
lt looked so elegant.
l want to get one for my wife.

361
00:26:31,168 --> 00:26:32,965
Mr Chow, you're so good
to your wife!

362
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:37,245
Not really! My wife is so fussy.

363
00:26:37,768 --> 00:26:40,885
Her birthday is some days away.
l don't know what to get her.

364
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:47,557
Could you buy one for me
to give her?

365
00:26:48,288 --> 00:26:51,405
Maybe she wouldn't want one
just exactly the same.

366
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,797
You're right,
l didn't think of that.

367
00:26:57,728 --> 00:26:59,127
A woman would mind.

368
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,041
Yes, especially since
we're neighbors.

369
00:27:04,768 --> 00:27:06,918
Do they come in other colors?

370
00:27:09,008 --> 00:27:10,885
l'd have to ask my husband.

371
00:27:11,568 --> 00:27:12,557
Why?

372
00:27:13,528 --> 00:27:16,804
He bought it for me
on a business trip abroad.

373
00:27:17,048 --> 00:27:18,720
They aren't on sale here.

374
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,041
Then never mind.

375
00:27:30,488 --> 00:27:31,523
Actually...

376
00:27:31,768 --> 00:27:33,759
l want to ask you something too.

377
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,604
What?

378
00:27:38,168 --> 00:27:39,521
Where did you buy your tie?

379
00:27:42,448 --> 00:27:44,325
l don't know where it came from.

380
00:27:45,048 --> 00:27:46,879
My wife buys all my ties.

381
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:48,158
Really?

382
00:27:50,448 --> 00:27:55,841
She bought this one
on a business trip abroad.

383
00:27:56,328 --> 00:27:57,886
lt's not on sale here.

384
00:27:59,208 --> 00:28:00,846
What a coincidence!

385
00:28:03,488 --> 00:28:04,716
Yes.

386
00:28:10,208 --> 00:28:11,607
Actually...

387
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:16,527
My husband has one just like it.

388
00:28:17,688 --> 00:28:19,963
He said it was a gift from his boss.

389
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:21,846
So he wears it every day.

390
00:28:26,848 --> 00:28:29,316
And my wife has a bag
just like yours.

391
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,527
l know,

392
00:28:31,768 --> 00:28:32,837
l've seen it.

393
00:28:35,488 --> 00:28:37,797
What are you getting at, actually?

394
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:51,682
l thought l was the only one
who knew.

395
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:11,325
l wonder how it began...

396
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:30,164
lt's late...
won't your wife complain?

397
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:34,040
She's used to it, she doesn't care.

398
00:29:36,488 --> 00:29:38,080
And your husband?

399
00:29:38,528 --> 00:29:40,405
He must be asleep by now.

400
00:29:44,448 --> 00:29:46,120
Shall we stay out tonight?

401
00:29:52,888 --> 00:29:55,243
My husband would never say that.

402
00:29:57,648 --> 00:29:59,240
What would he say?

403
00:29:59,848 --> 00:30:01,998
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that.

404
00:30:02,808 --> 00:30:04,958
Someone must have made
the first move.

405
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:06,760
Who else could it be?

406
00:30:12,008 --> 00:30:14,886
lt's late...
won't your wife complain?

407
00:30:15,648 --> 00:30:18,082
She's used to it, she doesn't care.

408
00:30:19,488 --> 00:30:21,001
And your husband?

409
00:30:21,848 --> 00:30:23,759
He must be asleep by now.

410
00:30:44,488 --> 00:30:46,080
l can't say it.

411
00:30:50,328 --> 00:30:51,886
l understand.

412
00:30:54,288 --> 00:30:56,404
After all, it's already happened.

413
00:30:56,648 --> 00:30:59,242
lt doesn't matter
who made the first move.

414
00:31:02,928 --> 00:31:04,805
Do you really know your wife?

415
00:31:33,768 --> 00:31:36,202
- You order for me.
- Why?

416
00:31:40,448 --> 00:31:42,643
l've no idea what your wife likes.

417
00:31:52,768 --> 00:31:54,520
What about your husband?

418
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:35,316
Like it hot?

419
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:41,119
Your wife likes hot dishes.

420
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:10,928
Why did you call me
at the office today?

421
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,644
l had nothing to do.
l wanted to hear your voice.

422
00:33:23,048 --> 00:33:26,723
You have my husband down pat.
He's a real sweet-talker.

423
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:54,204
Why didn't you call me today?

424
00:33:55,208 --> 00:33:57,278
l was afraid you won't like it.

425
00:33:58,768 --> 00:34:00,440
Then don't call me again.

426
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:18,402
Mrs Chan!
A letter from your husband.

427
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:23,163
lt's not for me,
it's for Mr Chow next door.

428
00:34:23,368 --> 00:34:27,486
The Japanese stamp made me think
it was your husband.

429
00:34:28,328 --> 00:34:29,886
So l was wrong.

430
00:34:45,408 --> 00:34:46,966
Your wife's in Japan?

431
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:50,202
How did you know?

432
00:34:52,608 --> 00:34:54,678
What did she say in her letter?

433
00:34:54,968 --> 00:34:56,083
Nothing special.

434
00:34:58,168 --> 00:35:00,284
Anything about
when she'd be back?

435
00:35:01,568 --> 00:35:02,683
No.

436
00:35:03,688 --> 00:35:06,043
What do you think
they're doing right now?

437
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:42,804
- Are you alright?
- l'm fine.

438
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:45,840
Please pull up here!

439
00:35:46,448 --> 00:35:47,437
Why?

440
00:35:48,048 --> 00:35:49,606
l'll get off first.

441
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:51,882
No, let me.

442
00:36:52,488 --> 00:36:54,683
- Mrs Chan!
- Ah Ping! You're back?

443
00:36:55,568 --> 00:36:56,523
Visiting Mr Chow?

444
00:36:56,728 --> 00:36:59,288
Yes, l thought we'd have lunch.
But he isn't well.

445
00:36:59,488 --> 00:37:02,719
- What's wrong with him?
- He's got a fever. He's all alone.

446
00:37:02,928 --> 00:37:05,362
So l'm gonna buy him
something to eat.

447
00:37:06,088 --> 00:37:07,487
The congee downstairs
is quite good.

448
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:09,201
He doesn't want congee.

449
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:10,722
What does he want?

450
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,567
Can't taste anything,
so he wants sesame syrup.

451
00:37:13,768 --> 00:37:15,087
Damned troublesome!

452
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:22,286
Amah!

453
00:37:22,608 --> 00:37:25,168
Mrs Suen, she's hanging
the washing on the roof.

454
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,802
- Oh, you're back.
- Yes. You've been out?

455
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:31,318
My mother's birthday is coming up.

456
00:37:31,528 --> 00:37:33,484
So l took her to buy some fabric.

457
00:37:33,688 --> 00:37:35,963
lt took all day, l'm half dead!

458
00:37:36,328 --> 00:37:38,284
And l had my hair done...
ls it nice?

459
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:39,477
Very nice!

460
00:37:39,688 --> 00:37:41,246
What are you cooking?

461
00:37:42,088 --> 00:37:44,602
l had a sudden craving
for sesame syrup.

462
00:37:45,048 --> 00:37:47,562
That whole pot is for you?

463
00:37:48,008 --> 00:37:50,363
l thought l might as well
make a potful.

464
00:37:51,128 --> 00:37:52,846
You're so thoughtful!

465
00:37:53,568 --> 00:37:55,206
- Please try it.
- l will.

466
00:37:56,288 --> 00:37:57,437
What a coincidence!

467
00:37:57,648 --> 00:37:59,127
Going out?

468
00:37:59,328 --> 00:38:02,320
l'll buy some noodles, l'm starving.

469
00:38:02,768 --> 00:38:03,883
Hungry? Will you join me?

470
00:38:05,168 --> 00:38:06,157
No thanks.

471
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:08,487
Just off work?

472
00:38:08,808 --> 00:38:10,366
You must be very busy.

473
00:38:10,568 --> 00:38:13,685
Actually,
l've been to see a picture.

474
00:38:14,608 --> 00:38:16,166
Really? How was it?

475
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:17,324
So-so.

476
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:20,124
l used to like
going to the pictures.

477
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:22,000
You had many hobbies before.

478
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:25,280
On your own,
you are free to do lots of things.

479
00:38:25,968 --> 00:38:27,924
Everything changes
when you marry.

480
00:38:28,208 --> 00:38:30,039
lt must be decided together...

481
00:38:30,248 --> 00:38:31,158
Right?

482
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:37,324
l sometimes wonder
what l'd be if l hadn't married.

483
00:38:37,528 --> 00:38:39,439
Have you ever thought of that?

484
00:38:41,608 --> 00:38:42,597
Maybe happier!

485
00:38:46,288 --> 00:38:49,439
l didn't know married life
would be so complicated!

486
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,767
When you're single,

487
00:38:51,968 --> 00:38:54,482
you are only responsible
to yourself.

488
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:56,640
Once you're married,

489
00:38:57,608 --> 00:39:00,042
doing well on your own
is not enough.

490
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:05,836
Don't brood on it,
maybe he'll be back soon.

491
00:39:09,288 --> 00:39:10,198
What about you?

492
00:39:11,048 --> 00:39:13,323
Actually, we're in the same boat.

493
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:17,760
But l don't brood on it.

494
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:20,406
lt's not my fault.

495
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:23,841
l can't waste time
wondering if l made mistakes.

496
00:39:24,048 --> 00:39:25,800
Life's too short for that.

497
00:39:27,088 --> 00:39:28,680
Something must change.

498
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:31,760
So what's your plan?

499
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,598
l want to write
a martial-arts serial.

500
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,645
Actually, l've started one.
l'll show it to you.

501
00:39:40,848 --> 00:39:41,963
Great!

502
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:45,686
You like them too,
so why not help me write it?

503
00:39:45,888 --> 00:39:49,244
l wouldn't know how,
l only read them!

504
00:39:49,448 --> 00:39:51,643
We could discuss it together.

505
00:39:52,928 --> 00:39:54,600
Alright, l'll try my best.

506
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:58,085
l never thanked you
for the sesame syrup.

507
00:39:58,448 --> 00:40:01,565
There's no need,
l was making it anyway.

508
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:06,437
Amazing! l was craving
for some sesame syrup that day.

509
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:08,959
Really? What a coincidence!

510
00:40:09,288 --> 00:40:10,721
lt really was!

511
00:40:12,528 --> 00:40:14,405
l'll go for those noodles.

512
00:42:35,525 --> 00:42:38,198
Again! Halfway through dinner,
he's drunk! Disgusting!

513
00:42:38,405 --> 00:42:41,363
l told you to stop!
What can you do?

514
00:42:48,845 --> 00:42:49,800
lt's me!

515
00:42:50,005 --> 00:42:51,358
You scared me.

516
00:42:51,565 --> 00:42:53,123
How's Mr Koo?

517
00:42:53,565 --> 00:42:55,044
Drunk, as usual.

518
00:43:03,765 --> 00:43:05,960
l didn't expect them back so early!

519
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:10,963
Since you're trapped here,
finish the noodles.

520
00:43:14,365 --> 00:43:16,083
They'll probably go soon.

521
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,238
Want some soup?

522
00:43:31,205 --> 00:43:32,843
Want some soup?

523
00:43:43,765 --> 00:43:46,199
Mrs Suen! Playing here tonight!

524
00:43:47,165 --> 00:43:49,759
Yes, Mrs Koo is dealing
with her husband.

525
00:43:50,365 --> 00:43:52,481
l could do that.

526
00:43:52,685 --> 00:43:54,835
No, we should not trouble you.

527
00:43:55,925 --> 00:43:58,155
Think you'll play all night?

528
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:00,953
No, we'll just play eight rounds.

529
00:44:05,365 --> 00:44:07,083
They'll play till morning?

530
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:10,275
Mrs Suen says only eight rounds.

531
00:44:10,485 --> 00:44:12,043
You believe that?

532
00:44:18,085 --> 00:44:21,361
You get some rest,
l'll wake you when they leave.

533
00:44:21,965 --> 00:44:23,080
And you?

534
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:25,476
l have a chapter to finish.

535
00:44:38,445 --> 00:44:39,878
Where have you got to?

536
00:44:40,085 --> 00:44:41,962
The drunken master just showed up.

537
00:44:42,165 --> 00:44:44,042
When did he get written in?

538
00:44:45,045 --> 00:44:46,239
Just now!

539
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:10,641
Mr Chow, home so early?

540
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:13,484
- l went out to buy some food.
- No work today?

541
00:45:13,685 --> 00:45:15,403
l don't feel so good,
l'm staying home.

542
00:45:15,605 --> 00:45:17,721
A sick man shouldn't eat
all that sticky rice.

543
00:45:17,925 --> 00:45:19,517
Some of it is for later.

544
00:45:19,725 --> 00:45:21,443
Don't stuff yourself!

545
00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:22,795
Good morning!

546
00:45:23,005 --> 00:45:24,438
Good morning,
finished your game?

547
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:29,799
No yet, but Mr Yang has to work.
Mr Tsai is coming to replace him.

548
00:45:31,285 --> 00:45:33,355
Did you call the office for me?

549
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:34,714
Yes.

550
00:45:34,965 --> 00:45:36,557
What did you tell them?

551
00:45:36,765 --> 00:45:38,960
That you weren't feeling well.

552
00:45:39,685 --> 00:45:41,403
Did they ask who you were?

553
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:42,640
No.

554
00:45:45,565 --> 00:45:47,920
Probably took me for your husband.

555
00:45:48,525 --> 00:45:51,119
Mr Ho knows that he's away.

556
00:45:51,525 --> 00:45:53,163
Pretend he's come back.

557
00:46:01,685 --> 00:46:03,721
Maybe we're being too cautious?

558
00:46:03,925 --> 00:46:05,597
l'm always round anyway.

559
00:46:05,805 --> 00:46:07,761
We shouldn't have panicked.

560
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:12,243
Well, they did turn up
without warning.

561
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:14,197
What would they assume?

562
00:46:17,325 --> 00:46:19,156
One can't put a foot wrong.

563
00:46:57,245 --> 00:46:58,280
You can go!

564
00:47:21,685 --> 00:47:24,358
- Amah!
- Mrs Chan! You're back very late!

565
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,881
l had a lot of work today.

566
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:29,600
l didn't see you leave this morning.

567
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,636
l had breakfast with my mother.

568
00:47:31,845 --> 00:47:33,995
You weren't here when l left.

569
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,035
Where's Mrs Suen?

570
00:47:36,245 --> 00:47:39,794
Asleep,
she played mahjong all day.

571
00:47:40,005 --> 00:47:42,155
- Be quiet, don't wake her.
- Alright!

572
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,396
Mrs Chan, is your leg alright?

573
00:47:44,605 --> 00:47:46,561
lt's these new shoes.

574
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:33,121
Why a special dinner tonight?

575
00:48:33,685 --> 00:48:37,439
Since you won't take
your share of the writing fee...

576
00:48:38,725 --> 00:48:41,444
All l did
was give you some thoughts.

577
00:48:42,405 --> 00:48:44,839
Someone else
is asking for a serial too.

578
00:48:45,085 --> 00:48:46,723
There'll be more work soon.

579
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:50,679
Really? So quickly?
lsn't the workload too much?

580
00:48:50,965 --> 00:48:53,479
That's why
l'm looking for a new place.

581
00:48:53,765 --> 00:48:54,880
What for?

582
00:48:56,605 --> 00:48:57,674
To write in!

583
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,676
lt'll be more convenient.

584
00:49:01,245 --> 00:49:04,999
There's nothing between us,
but l don't want gossip.

585
00:49:06,725 --> 00:49:08,477
What do you think?

586
00:49:09,325 --> 00:49:11,361
Why waste money?

587
00:49:11,845 --> 00:49:16,077
You don't need me,
you can write on your own.

588
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:55,956
Who do you want?

589
00:49:56,165 --> 00:49:57,757
Chow Mo-Wan?

590
00:49:58,045 --> 00:50:00,320
He hasn't been in for several days.

591
00:50:02,925 --> 00:50:04,802
We're looking for him too.

592
00:50:06,725 --> 00:50:08,875
May l know who's calling?

593
00:50:11,405 --> 00:50:12,963
Any message?

594
00:50:14,885 --> 00:50:16,876
lt's no trouble, goodbye.

595
00:50:28,845 --> 00:50:30,676
Please get this to Accounts.

596
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:33,399
And have the air-conditioner
serviced tomorrow.

597
00:50:33,605 --> 00:50:34,560
Mr Ho!

598
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:38,161
No need to stay
if everything's done.

599
00:50:38,365 --> 00:50:40,037
- l'll lock up.
- Yes.

600
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:52,634
Hello?

601
00:50:57,885 --> 00:50:59,443
Where are you?

602
00:52:00,525 --> 00:52:02,243
l'll come again tomorrow.

603
00:52:03,045 --> 00:52:05,559
No need,
l'll be alright after some rest.

604
00:52:06,165 --> 00:52:07,962
lt's no trouble.

605
00:52:08,805 --> 00:52:11,239
l'll bring you some food...
What would you like?

606
00:52:11,445 --> 00:52:12,798
Whatever.

607
00:52:13,445 --> 00:52:16,118
Then l'll leave now. Get some rest.

608
00:52:16,325 --> 00:52:18,122
Call me when you get home.

609
00:52:18,605 --> 00:52:21,358
Let it ring three times,
then hang up.

610
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:22,961
Alright.

611
00:52:29,965 --> 00:52:31,683
l didn't think you'd come.

612
00:52:35,485 --> 00:52:37,282
We won't be like them.

613
00:52:39,045 --> 00:52:40,114
See you tomorrow.

614
00:54:50,925 --> 00:54:52,597
Tell me honestly...

615
00:54:55,365 --> 00:54:57,083
Do you have a mistress?

616
00:54:59,645 --> 00:55:01,283
You're crazy!

617
00:55:04,045 --> 00:55:05,558
Who told you l had?

618
00:55:05,765 --> 00:55:07,403
Never mind who.

619
00:55:08,165 --> 00:55:09,917
Do you or don't you?

620
00:55:12,405 --> 00:55:13,520
No.

621
00:55:18,685 --> 00:55:20,437
Don't lie!

622
00:55:21,765 --> 00:55:23,437
Look at me...

623
00:55:28,085 --> 00:55:30,724
l'm asking you,
do you have a mistress?

624
00:55:34,925 --> 00:55:35,835
Yes!

625
00:55:41,805 --> 00:55:43,443
That's no reaction!

626
00:55:44,445 --> 00:55:48,484
lf he admits it outright,
let him have it!

627
00:55:52,045 --> 00:55:54,843
l wasn't expecting
he would admit it so easily.

628
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:58,002
l didn't know how to react!

629
00:56:00,045 --> 00:56:01,319
One more time, alright?

630
00:56:18,405 --> 00:56:20,236
Tell me frankly...

631
00:56:21,405 --> 00:56:23,123
Do you have a mistress?

632
00:56:26,685 --> 00:56:28,084
You're crazy!

633
00:56:33,325 --> 00:56:34,997
Who told you that?

634
00:56:36,405 --> 00:56:39,602
Never mind that,
do you or don't you?

635
00:56:44,805 --> 00:56:45,920
No.

636
00:56:48,485 --> 00:56:50,043
Don't lie!

637
00:56:50,525 --> 00:56:52,163
Tell me!

638
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:54,479
Look at me,

639
00:56:55,085 --> 00:56:56,598
do you have a mistress?

640
00:57:05,645 --> 00:57:06,634
Yes!

641
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:33,883
Are you alright?

642
00:57:37,205 --> 00:57:39,514
l didn't expect it to hurt so much.

643
00:57:48,445 --> 00:57:51,005
This is just a rehearsal.

644
00:57:54,045 --> 00:57:56,320
He won't really admit it so readily.

645
00:57:56,605 --> 00:58:00,075
lt's alright, don't take it so hard.

646
00:58:04,485 --> 00:58:06,555
You've been out a lot lately.

647
00:58:06,805 --> 00:58:07,794
Yes.

648
00:58:09,925 --> 00:58:13,554
lt's right to enjoy yourself
while you're young.

649
00:58:14,485 --> 00:58:16,316
But don't overdo it.

650
00:58:19,245 --> 00:58:21,122
When will your husband be back?

651
00:58:21,565 --> 00:58:23,123
Soon!

652
00:58:24,245 --> 00:58:28,318
ln future,
don't let him travel so much.

653
00:58:29,165 --> 00:58:32,316
A couple should spend time
together.

654
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,877
Don't you agree?

655
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:37,954
Good night.

656
00:58:58,965 --> 00:59:00,842
Will you come over tonight?

657
00:59:01,045 --> 00:59:02,114
What for?

658
00:59:02,325 --> 00:59:04,885
The editor's hounding me,
he says l'm too slow.

659
00:59:05,085 --> 00:59:07,440
l need your help,
when can you come?

660
00:59:08,445 --> 00:59:10,401
Not anytime soon.

661
00:59:11,165 --> 00:59:12,314
Why not?

662
00:59:13,085 --> 00:59:15,918
Mrs Suen lectured me last night.

663
00:59:16,245 --> 00:59:17,519
What did she say?

664
00:59:17,805 --> 00:59:19,363
Rather not say.

665
00:59:19,685 --> 00:59:22,404
We shouldn't see so much
of each other.

666
00:59:32,725 --> 00:59:35,444
Mrs Chan,
going out for noodles again?

667
00:59:35,645 --> 00:59:39,320
Not tonight,
l'll make myself something.

668
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:45,723
Join us,
we're having vegetable won-tons!

669
00:59:46,365 --> 00:59:47,559
Alright.

670
01:02:13,045 --> 01:02:15,161
- No lunch today, Mr Ho?
- No.

671
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:18,755
A Mr Chow just called for you.

672
01:02:19,005 --> 01:02:21,075
He wants you to call him back.

673
01:02:23,805 --> 01:02:24,715
Thank you.

674
01:02:56,405 --> 01:02:58,475
- Back from work?
- Yes.

675
01:03:00,285 --> 01:03:02,799
- Strange weather!
- lsn't it?

676
01:03:03,445 --> 01:03:04,958
Been here long?

677
01:03:05,165 --> 01:03:06,723
Just a while.

678
01:03:08,725 --> 01:03:10,716
l don't think it'll stop soon.

679
01:03:12,565 --> 01:03:13,520
Wait for me.

680
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:42,723
l'll see you home.

681
01:03:43,165 --> 01:03:46,396
We'd better not be seen together.

682
01:03:48,125 --> 01:03:49,797
Then you go first.

683
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:53,523
lf they see your umbrella,

684
01:03:53,725 --> 01:03:55,920
they'll know l was with you.

685
01:03:58,245 --> 01:03:59,837
l wasn't thinking.

686
01:04:03,325 --> 01:04:06,237
You go first, l'll wait a while.

687
01:04:08,285 --> 01:04:09,923
l'll keep you company.

688
01:04:31,005 --> 01:04:32,643
Did you try to call me?

689
01:04:34,685 --> 01:04:36,960
l wasn't sure you got the message.

690
01:04:37,765 --> 01:04:39,881
Could you get me a boat ticket?

691
01:04:41,805 --> 01:04:43,523
To where?

692
01:04:44,845 --> 01:04:46,961
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore.

693
01:04:47,285 --> 01:04:50,675
They're short of staff,
he'd like me to go and help.

694
01:04:54,645 --> 01:04:56,397
How long will you stay?

695
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:59,244
Don't know, l'll play it by ear.

696
01:05:03,925 --> 01:05:05,836
Why rush off to Singapore?

697
01:05:07,725 --> 01:05:09,317
A change of scene...

698
01:05:11,125 --> 01:05:13,241
l've had enough of the gossip.

699
01:05:14,725 --> 01:05:17,159
We know it's not true,
so why worry?

700
01:05:20,565 --> 01:05:24,763
l used to think that too,
and it didn't worry me.

701
01:05:28,285 --> 01:05:30,515
l thought we wouldn't be like them.

702
01:05:34,405 --> 01:05:35,997
But l was wrong.

703
01:05:38,765 --> 01:05:40,721
You won't leave your husband.

704
01:05:43,365 --> 01:05:45,003
So l'd rather go away.

705
01:05:51,605 --> 01:05:54,483
l didn't think
you'd fall in love with me.

706
01:05:55,125 --> 01:05:56,922
l didn't either.

707
01:06:01,645 --> 01:06:04,398
l was only curious
to know how it started.

708
01:06:05,165 --> 01:06:06,757
Now l know.

709
01:06:08,325 --> 01:06:10,793
Feelings can creep up
just like that.

710
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:16,276
l thought l was in control.

711
01:06:17,125 --> 01:06:19,878
But l hate to think
of your husband coming home.

712
01:06:20,445 --> 01:06:21,958
l wish he'd stay away!

713
01:06:23,685 --> 01:06:25,118
l'm so bad!

714
01:06:28,845 --> 01:06:30,597
Will you do me one favor?

715
01:06:31,805 --> 01:06:32,760
What?

716
01:06:34,285 --> 01:06:35,957
l want to be prepared...

717
01:07:30,405 --> 01:07:32,600
You'd better not see me again.

718
01:07:36,885 --> 01:07:38,603
ls your husband back?

719
01:07:39,605 --> 01:07:40,924
Yes...

720
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,317
Am l hopeless?

721
01:07:46,565 --> 01:07:47,884
Not really.

722
01:07:57,885 --> 01:07:59,557
l won't see you again.

723
01:08:01,965 --> 01:08:04,035
Keep a closer eye on your husband.

724
01:08:42,725 --> 01:08:44,397
Please...

725
01:08:45,525 --> 01:08:47,993
Don't be serious,
it's only a rehearsal.

726
01:08:49,045 --> 01:08:50,364
Don't cry!

727
01:08:54,685 --> 01:08:56,277
This isn't real...

728
01:09:44,445 --> 01:09:46,800
l don't want to go home tonight.

729
01:10:11,925 --> 01:10:16,203
Mei-Yi wants to dedicate a song
to herhoneymooning friends.

730
01:10:16,405 --> 01:10:21,001
And Mrs Cheung wishes the best
to herneighbors.

731
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:23,994
And Mr Chan,
now in business in Japan,

732
01:10:24,205 --> 01:10:29,643
wants to wish his wife
a happy birthday.

733
01:10:30,085 --> 01:10:34,795
So Iet's aII enjoy Zhou Xuan
singing in ''FuII BIoom''.

734
01:12:11,565 --> 01:12:12,759
lt's me.

735
01:12:14,125 --> 01:12:15,922
lf there's an extra ticket...

736
01:12:17,005 --> 01:12:18,404
would you go with me?

737
01:14:40,845 --> 01:14:42,278
lt's me.

738
01:14:43,125 --> 01:14:45,161
lf there's an extra ticket...

739
01:14:45,405 --> 01:14:47,361
would you go with me?

740
01:14:58,445 --> 01:15:00,754
SlNGAPORE, 1963

741
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:05,481
Mr Chow has gone to work.

742
01:15:06,165 --> 01:15:08,042
Any message?

743
01:15:09,165 --> 01:15:10,962
You're welcome!

744
01:15:39,645 --> 01:15:41,158
Has anyone been in my room?

745
01:15:41,365 --> 01:15:42,241
No.

746
01:15:42,685 --> 01:15:45,074
- Something's missing.
- What?

747
01:16:14,205 --> 01:16:15,274
ln the old days,

748
01:16:16,725 --> 01:16:21,799
if someone had a secret
they didn't want to share...

749
01:16:22,405 --> 01:16:24,043
You know what they did?

750
01:16:24,925 --> 01:16:26,643
Have no idea.

751
01:16:29,965 --> 01:16:32,433
They went up a mountain,
found a tree...

752
01:16:33,805 --> 01:16:35,477
Carved a hole in it...

753
01:16:36,245 --> 01:16:38,554
And whispered the secret
into the hole.

754
01:16:39,205 --> 01:16:41,321
Then they covered it with mud.

755
01:16:42,885 --> 01:16:46,958
And leave the secret there forever.

756
01:16:49,125 --> 01:16:53,038
What a pain!
l'd just go to get laid.

757
01:16:56,205 --> 01:16:57,877
Not everyone's like you!

758
01:16:59,085 --> 01:17:03,044
l'm just an average guy,
l don't have secrets like you.

759
01:17:03,245 --> 01:17:05,964
You bottle things up!

760
01:17:06,205 --> 01:17:07,923
Tell me something!

761
01:17:08,485 --> 01:17:10,077
l don't have secrets.

762
01:17:11,685 --> 01:17:13,676
Come off it, buddy!

763
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,358
l won't tell anyone.

764
01:19:38,405 --> 01:19:39,918
Hello, Singapore Daily.

765
01:19:40,645 --> 01:19:41,839
Hold on.

766
01:19:43,005 --> 01:19:44,563
Mr Chow, call for you.

767
01:19:45,165 --> 01:19:46,314
Thanks!

768
01:19:48,965 --> 01:19:50,114
Hello?

769
01:19:55,645 --> 01:19:56,634
Hello?

770
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:42,521
HONG KONG, 1966

771
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:46,039
- Who is it?
- lt's me.

772
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:49,559
- Mrs Chan, long time no see!
- Yes.

773
01:20:50,285 --> 01:20:52,082
- Amah, who's there?
- Mrs Suen!

774
01:20:52,285 --> 01:20:54,162
What brings you here?

775
01:20:54,405 --> 01:20:56,077
lt's been a while.

776
01:20:56,485 --> 01:20:59,841
l was nearby so l thought
l'd bring your boat ticket.

777
01:21:00,285 --> 01:21:01,240
And a small gift.

778
01:21:01,445 --> 01:21:04,323
You shouldn't have,
it's nice just to see you.

779
01:21:04,525 --> 01:21:06,402
The place is in such a mess!

780
01:21:06,605 --> 01:21:07,720
Already started packing?

781
01:21:07,925 --> 01:21:13,921
lt's hopeless,
l can't bear to throw things away!

782
01:21:15,765 --> 01:21:17,357
Let's find you a seat.

783
01:21:21,445 --> 01:21:23,242
- Have some tea!
- Thank you!

784
01:21:23,765 --> 01:21:27,724
Eat with us, Mrs Chan!
l'm going to the market.

785
01:21:29,485 --> 01:21:32,363
l can't, l have work waiting.

786
01:21:33,205 --> 01:21:34,843
Don't rush off!

787
01:21:35,325 --> 01:21:39,637
Mrs Suen will be upset
if you don't eat here.

788
01:21:40,405 --> 01:21:42,282
Amah, pour me some tea too.

789
01:21:43,925 --> 01:21:45,244
How's your husband?

790
01:21:45,445 --> 01:21:47,117
He's fine, thank you.

791
01:21:47,565 --> 01:21:48,998
How long will you be away?

792
01:21:49,205 --> 01:21:50,763
l don't know.

793
01:21:51,045 --> 01:21:53,434
lf l like it, l might stay!

794
01:21:54,205 --> 01:21:55,320
Why?

795
01:21:55,605 --> 01:22:01,043
My daughter worries
about the situation in Hong Kong.

796
01:22:01,325 --> 01:22:03,839
l don't want to leave.

797
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:09,836
Since the Koos left, l don't have
my mahjong partners anymore.

798
01:22:10,565 --> 01:22:15,685
And my daughter needs help
with her kids in the US.

799
01:22:19,085 --> 01:22:20,643
What about this place?

800
01:22:21,485 --> 01:22:23,521
l'm not sure...

801
01:22:25,085 --> 01:22:27,041
l don't want to sell it.

802
01:22:28,805 --> 01:22:30,716
So l might rent it out.

803
01:22:31,725 --> 01:22:33,443
How much would you want?

804
01:22:34,765 --> 01:22:36,323
You're interested?

805
01:22:36,605 --> 01:22:40,803
You could have it at a discount.

806
01:22:41,165 --> 01:22:42,564
l'll think about it.

807
01:22:42,805 --> 01:22:44,204
Mrs Suen, your tea!

808
01:22:45,685 --> 01:22:47,880
Who lives next door now?

809
01:22:48,365 --> 01:22:54,361
l don't really know them.

810
01:22:54,805 --> 01:23:00,596
The Koos were almost like family!

811
01:23:02,085 --> 01:23:04,838
lt was so nice then, wasn't it?

812
01:23:05,805 --> 01:23:06,920
Yes.

813
01:23:08,325 --> 01:23:09,599
Let's sit over here.

814
01:23:34,845 --> 01:23:35,960
Yes?

815
01:23:36,165 --> 01:23:37,234
ls Mr Koo in?

816
01:23:37,645 --> 01:23:39,954
He moved long ago.

817
01:23:41,085 --> 01:23:42,404
Do you know where he is?

818
01:23:43,405 --> 01:23:44,997
You know him well?

819
01:23:45,565 --> 01:23:47,157
l used to live here.

820
01:23:48,405 --> 01:23:50,157
ls Mrs Suen still next door?

821
01:23:50,405 --> 01:23:55,195
She's gone! lt's too chaotic,
everyone's running away.

822
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:57,837
So who lives there now?

823
01:23:58,325 --> 01:24:02,159
A woman and her son.

824
01:24:02,645 --> 01:24:04,522
The kid is cute.

825
01:24:07,205 --> 01:24:11,676
No address in the Philippines...
Just his son's phone number.

826
01:24:15,005 --> 01:24:18,441
- l can't accept this!
- Please, you must.

827
01:24:19,085 --> 01:24:20,677
Thank you, then.

828
01:24:31,525 --> 01:24:33,083
That era has passed.

829
01:24:33,325 --> 01:24:35,919
Nothing that beIonged to it
exists any more.

830
01:24:36,885 --> 01:24:38,113
Are you ready?

831
01:24:38,325 --> 01:24:40,316
- Okay!
- Let's go!

832
01:24:52,205 --> 01:24:55,322
CAMBODlA, 1 966

833
01:24:55,605 --> 01:25:00,201
The presidentiaI corps waits
at Pochentong Airport...

834
01:25:00,565 --> 01:25:04,717
Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and Queen Sisowath Kossamak

835
01:25:05,285 --> 01:25:07,003
come forward
to greet GeneraI De GauIIe.

836
01:25:13,645 --> 01:25:18,560
It's ten kiIometers
from Pochentong to Phnom Penh.

837
01:25:19,605 --> 01:25:22,073
200,000 peopIe Iine the route.

838
01:25:22,285 --> 01:25:24,480
A weIcome unprecedented
in the history of the kingdom.

839
01:28:51,245 --> 01:28:54,203
He remembers those vanished years.

840
01:28:54,405 --> 01:28:58,034
As though Iooking through
a dusty window pane,

841
01:28:58,245 --> 01:29:02,204
the past is something he couId see,
but not touch.

842
01:29:02,405 --> 01:29:06,717
And everything he sees
is bIurred and indistinct.

843
01:29:11,365 --> 01:29:15,677
End

844
