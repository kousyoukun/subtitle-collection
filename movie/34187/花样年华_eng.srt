1
00:00:57,557 --> 00:00:59,790
The fish is very fresh today

2
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:02,590
Eat up, enjoy yourself

3
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,918
Sorry to interrupt your dinner

4
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:10,190
Never mind, let's sit over there

5
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:14,730
It's quite late

6
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:16,058
I've just finished work

7
00:01:17,418 --> 00:01:18,820
What should I call you?

8
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:19,912
You can call me Mrs. Suen

9
00:01:20,507 --> 00:01:21,520
And you?

10
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:22,775
My husband's name is Chan

11
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:25,673
Call me when you decide I will

12
00:01:26,174 --> 00:01:27,666
Did you write down my number?

13
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:28,903
Yes, I did

14
00:01:29,148 --> 00:01:30,676
Fine, I'll see you out

15
00:01:30,943 --> 00:01:33,998
Don't trouble No trouble

16
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:45,508
So it's agreed then

17
00:01:45,512 --> 00:01:47,167
Thank you very much, I should go

18
00:01:47,169 --> 00:01:48,338
Fine Bye

19
00:01:48,392 --> 00:01:49,986
Take care, goodbye

20
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:53,064
You've a room to let?

21
00:01:53,485 --> 00:01:56,977
Sorry, it's just been rented to that lady

22
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:58,467
Thanks

23
00:01:59,496 --> 00:02:00,991
How many of you?

24
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,468
Just me and my wife

25
00:02:03,587 --> 00:02:05,115
Why don't you try next door

26
00:02:05,383 --> 00:02:06,542
They've a vacant room too?

27
00:02:06,677 --> 00:02:09,832
Yes, Mr.Koo's son got married

28
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:10,886
and removed out

29
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,539
His room's empty

30
00:02:13,189 --> 00:02:13,991
Thank you

31
00:02:14,274 --> 00:02:15,993
You're too polite, Try asking them

32
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:16,740
Thank you

33
00:02:23,458 --> 00:02:24,447
This way, come on

34
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:25,852
Not that room

35
00:02:26,506 --> 00:02:30,738
Wrong again

36
00:02:31,515 --> 00:02:33,533
Careful, against the wall there

37
00:02:39,822 --> 00:02:41,332
The little cupboard over there

38
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:42,527
Be careful

39
00:02:43,287 --> 00:02:44,961
Don't break anything

40
00:02:45,374 --> 00:02:47,173
Not on top of the radio

41
00:02:48,046 --> 00:02:48,805
Mr.Chow

42
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:51,125
You have a lot of stuff for a couple

43
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,250
The wardrobe isn't mine, wrong again?

44
00:02:54,391 --> 00:02:55,380
It does next door

45
00:02:55,518 --> 00:02:57,395
Okay, next door

46
00:02:58,524 --> 00:03:00,593
There aren't my shoes

47
00:03:00,737 --> 00:03:02,756
They must go next door

48
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:06,606
What a coincidence, moving in on same day

49
00:03:07,541 --> 00:03:08,996
Is Mr.Chan here?

50
00:03:09,211 --> 00:03:11,110
He's working abroad

51
00:03:11,173 --> 00:03:12,369
He'll be back next week

52
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:14,920
You should have waited, then

53
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:18,525
It's too much for you on your own

54
00:03:18,771 --> 00:03:21,282
I can manage I'll ask Amah to help

55
00:03:21,483 --> 00:03:23,474
No need, I can manage

56
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,489
What's going on?

57
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,365
Mind that mirror

58
00:03:27,394 --> 00:03:29,387
Mrs. Chan, I'll leave you to it

59
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,239
Those books aren't mine Wrong again?

60
00:03:38,307 --> 00:03:39,525
Never mind, just leave them there

61
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:42,997
Mind how you hang the mirror it's fragile

62
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:44,237
Are these magazines yours?

63
00:03:45,487 --> 00:03:47,476
Yes, they're my husband's

64
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,096
He reads Japanese?

65
00:03:49,327 --> 00:03:51,318
A little, his boss is Japanese

66
00:03:51,874 --> 00:03:53,090
How should I address you?

67
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:54,368
My husband's name is Chan

68
00:03:54,922 --> 00:03:56,877
My name's Chow... I'll leave you in peace

69
00:03:56,966 --> 00:03:57,955
Thank you, Mr.Chow

70
00:03:58,136 --> 00:03:59,012
Don't mention it

71
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:03,877
I'll ask Mrs. Chan...

72
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:09,247
Mrs. Chan, eat with us before you go

73
00:04:09,574 --> 00:04:11,723
No thanks, I must dash to the airport

74
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:13,972
Your husband's coming back? Yes

75
00:04:14,166 --> 00:04:15,394
Then I won't keep you

76
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,648
Going out? Yes

77
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:23,811
Sorry, I'm late

78
00:04:24,685 --> 00:04:26,877
Amah, pour some beer

79
00:04:27,232 --> 00:04:28,209
Cheers

80
00:04:29,486 --> 00:04:34,239
Mrs. Chow, try some Shanghai dishes

81
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:35,939
Where is Mrs. Chan to so late?

82
00:04:36,523 --> 00:04:39,554
Meeting here husband at the airport

83
00:04:40,089 --> 00:04:41,538
So that's why she looks different

84
00:05:40,285 --> 00:05:42,896
It's all packed, take care on your trip

85
00:05:42,999 --> 00:05:43,954
I will

86
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,999
How long this time?

87
00:05:50,305 --> 00:05:51,954
Two to four weeks

88
00:05:53,101 --> 00:05:54,934
Remember when you come back

89
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,263
Bring back two more of those handbags

90
00:05:57,568 --> 00:05:58,159
Who for?

91
00:05:58,571 --> 00:05:59,605
Mr.Boss

92
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:00,592
Two of them?

93
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,360
You know why

94
00:06:03,246 --> 00:06:04,201
Different colours?

95
00:06:06,418 --> 00:06:08,329
The same will do? Who cares?

96
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,513
Whatever

97
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:24,958
Mrs. Ho

98
00:06:25,495 --> 00:06:27,594
Mr.Ho is still in a meeting

99
00:06:27,624 --> 00:06:28,656
He'll be home late

100
00:06:28,794 --> 00:06:29,863
Please don't wait to eat

101
00:06:33,469 --> 00:06:34,904
Yes, we're so busy at the moment

102
00:06:37,058 --> 00:06:39,089
Yes, I'll ask him to call you when he gets back

103
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,265
Did you call my wife?

104
00:06:50,709 --> 00:06:52,979
Yes, I said you'd be back later

105
00:06:53,965 --> 00:06:54,996
Have you booked the restaurant?

106
00:06:55,594 --> 00:06:56,868
A table for two at eight

107
00:06:57,597 --> 00:06:59,480
Miss Yu called to say

108
00:06:59,484 --> 00:07:00,100
she's on her way

109
00:07:01,146 --> 00:07:02,401
I'll be back after dinner

110
00:07:03,149 --> 00:07:05,504
can I bring you something?

111
00:07:06,155 --> 00:07:07,868
No thanks, I'll get my own

112
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:11,153
Leave when you're ready

113
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,075
I'll lock up

114
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,828
Good evening, Mr.Ho Evening

115
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:40,575
Going out, Mrs. Chan Yes

116
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:46,463
Going out so late?

117
00:07:46,689 --> 00:07:47,860
Just getting some noodles

118
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:51,353
Amah is making pork soup, join us

119
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:54,809
Thanks, I'm not really hungry I just want some air

120
00:07:55,038 --> 00:07:58,629
You're too polite Next time

121
00:08:01,258 --> 00:08:04,530
They're all starving, we can eat

122
00:08:07,228 --> 00:08:08,377
Have you spoken to Ming?

123
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,292
So I'll go with someone else

124
00:08:13,657 --> 00:08:14,692
Just kidding

125
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,902
I'll be early tonight, see you soon

126
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:24,945
Bye

127
00:08:27,223 --> 00:08:28,053
Chow

128
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:29,807
Coming

129
00:08:35,822 --> 00:08:41,054
Time to go, finish it tomorrow

130
00:08:41,082 --> 00:08:43,532
No, I'm nearly there

131
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:44,801
Oh, Ming

132
00:08:45,842 --> 00:08:48,161
I need a few days off next month why?

133
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:51,766
I promised my wife a trip

134
00:08:51,769 --> 00:08:52,981
Put in a word for me, will you?

135
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:55,567
I'll speak to personnel

136
00:08:55,568 --> 00:08:57,623
But the next lunch is on you

137
00:08:57,756 --> 00:08:59,132
I'll

138
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:00,855
Thanks, Ming

139
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,981
It's ready

140
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:08,161
No, it'll switch itself off

141
00:09:08,884 --> 00:09:11,354
I told you, it's not ready

142
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:15,044
A rice cooker, It's yours, Mrs. Koo?

143
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,991
No, it's beyond us

144
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:20,031
It's Mrs. Chan's

145
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:23,955
My husband brought it from Japan

146
00:09:24,205 --> 00:09:26,338
I wanted to show Mrs. Koo how good it is

147
00:09:26,626 --> 00:09:28,582
Now it's ready

148
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:30,958
It's workable, you can see

149
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:39,062
Mrs. Chan

150
00:09:39,734 --> 00:09:42,992
Could Mr.Chan get me one next time?

151
00:09:43,115 --> 00:09:44,116
No problem

152
00:09:44,619 --> 00:09:47,596
Mr.Chow, you should get one too

153
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:51,921
Your wife's so often late home

154
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,957
I couldn't trouble Mr.Chan

155
00:09:55,055 --> 00:09:57,273
It's just neighborly, isn't it?

156
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,991
It's no trouble

157
00:10:01,057 --> 00:10:02,275
I'll ask him to buy another next time

158
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:03,888
Thank you

159
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:15,811
Let's try the rice

160
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:20,665
Mr.Chan, sorry to trouble you about the rice cooker

161
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:22,913
It was really no trouble

162
00:10:23,901 --> 00:10:26,431
How much do I owe you?

163
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,990
Your wife has already paid me

164
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:29,845
Really?

165
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,011
She didn't tell you?

166
00:10:32,124 --> 00:10:33,554
She's been working late shifts

167
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:35,229
Often I'm asleep when she gets back

168
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,689
It must be hard for her

169
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:38,731
Yes

170
00:10:39,596 --> 00:10:40,585
Mrs. Chan isn't back yet?

171
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,826
She'll be back soon, you need to talk to her

172
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,900
A friend needs to go to Singapore

173
00:10:47,194 --> 00:10:49,704
I wonder if she could get a cheap ticket for him

174
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:51,360
I'll ask when she gets back

175
00:10:52,788 --> 00:10:53,977
I'm bothering you too much

176
00:10:54,917 --> 00:10:57,991
Don't mention it, we're neighbors

177
00:10:58,674 --> 00:10:59,884
I'll leave you in peace

178
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,912
Looking for me?

179
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:11,319
Damn right, where've you been?

180
00:11:11,531 --> 00:11:12,820
What's up?

181
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:14,982
Mrs. Chan called

182
00:11:15,455 --> 00:11:17,488
you left a hat at her office

183
00:11:17,501 --> 00:11:20,378
I meant to, I wanted an excuse to go back

184
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:22,208
I know your tricks

185
00:11:23,763 --> 00:11:25,434
she's married

186
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:27,172
I know

187
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,969
That's why I left

188
00:11:29,181 --> 00:11:30,736
otherwise I'd move in next door

189
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,444
If your wife wasn't so attractive

190
00:11:33,489 --> 00:11:35,144
She'd be a worried woman

191
00:11:37,309 --> 00:11:38,805
I'm not like you

192
00:11:41,129 --> 00:11:42,764
Please call Mrs. Chan for me

193
00:11:43,132 --> 00:11:44,960
I'll pick up the hat tomorrow

194
00:11:45,053 --> 00:11:46,527
And take her to lunch

195
00:11:47,056 --> 00:11:48,286
Dream on, I asked her to

196
00:11:48,487 --> 00:11:50,571
take the hat home

197
00:11:50,572 --> 00:11:52,113
I'll bring it in tomorrow

198
00:11:52,484 --> 00:11:55,340
You're kidding, some buddy you are

199
00:11:55,405 --> 00:11:57,238
Tell you what, let's go pick up now

200
00:11:59,246 --> 00:12:00,702
She should be off work by now

201
00:12:00,707 --> 00:12:01,942
We can go together

202
00:12:02,377 --> 00:12:03,653
I don't have time for this

203
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:05,419
Chow

204
00:12:05,508 --> 00:12:07,925
Yes, get out of here, I'm busy

205
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:10,804
Then I'll wait at your place

206
00:12:10,935 --> 00:12:11,947
That's all

207
00:12:12,354 --> 00:12:13,973
Ping

208
00:12:22,205 --> 00:12:24,274
Mr.Chow, is Mr.Koo in?

209
00:12:24,292 --> 00:12:27,387
He's out, forgot to buy the paper again?

210
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:28,839
That's right, I'll stop by later

211
00:12:28,843 --> 00:12:31,322
Maybe I can find it for you Thank you

212
00:12:42,243 --> 00:12:43,737
This one? Yes

213
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:48,816
I always loved those serials, hated to miss an episode

214
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,716
Really? You like them too?

215
00:12:50,926 --> 00:12:54,163
I even thought of writing one

216
00:12:54,767 --> 00:12:55,956
Why didn't you?

217
00:12:56,645 --> 00:12:59,122
I couldn't get started, so I gave up

218
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,411
I wasn't born to write martial arts stories

219
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:03,962
But you can borrow from my collection any time

220
00:13:04,118 --> 00:13:07,100
Not now, maybe another time, thanks

221
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:08,033
You're welcome

222
00:13:15,973 --> 00:13:17,567
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

223
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:20,767
I just want to return these to Mr.Chow is he in?

224
00:13:20,857 --> 00:13:22,615
He's been away for a few days

225
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:24,019
Why?

226
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,299
They had a quarrel

227
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:30,000
Leave them with me

228
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,517
I'll pass them back to him

229
00:13:32,128 --> 00:13:32,862
Thank you

230
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:43,091
Forget it

231
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,741
I'm on a replacement shift tonight

232
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:47,554
Talk to you later

233
00:13:49,035 --> 00:13:56,029
No need to pick me up

234
00:13:59,429 --> 00:14:00,505
She's already left

235
00:14:01,725 --> 00:14:04,919
Really? I was going to take her out for supper

236
00:14:05,733 --> 00:14:08,593
Didn't she tell you she was off early today

237
00:14:08,947 --> 00:14:11,863
She never remembers to tell me

238
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,521
Maybe she's home by now

239
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:16,976
I'll be off, then

240
00:14:17,588 --> 00:14:18,657
Okay, bye

241
00:16:43,487 --> 00:16:44,078
Hello

242
00:16:57,188 --> 00:16:58,281
You're out of hospital

243
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:01,234
Don't mention hospital, Lend me $30

244
00:17:01,688 --> 00:17:02,326
What for?

245
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,934
You gotta help me save face

246
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:05,998
What's the big deal?

247
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,999
It's Ah Hoi's fault

248
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,913
He gave me a racing tip, said it was a sure thing

249
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:15,099
Before they'd taken out the stitches

250
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,470
I rushed from hospital to Race Course

251
00:17:17,551 --> 00:17:18,827
I bet everything I had

252
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,209
and I lost my shirt

253
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,801
What did you expect?

254
00:17:23,729 --> 00:17:25,806
I thought it was my lucky day

255
00:17:26,025 --> 00:17:27,235
Anyhow, I had only $2 left

256
00:17:28,738 --> 00:17:31,696
So I went to the whorehouse

257
00:17:32,161 --> 00:17:33,876
You were in no shape for sex

258
00:17:34,248 --> 00:17:35,583
I thought it would improve for sex

259
00:17:38,423 --> 00:17:40,879
What would $2 buy you?

260
00:17:41,762 --> 00:17:45,193
I'm Kwai Fei's regular, she gives me credit

261
00:17:46,355 --> 00:17:47,644
You can have in on credit?

262
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,892
I left my ID card and

263
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:51,218
said I'd be back to redeem it

264
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,418
I thought a few dollars would be back easy to rustle up

265
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:55,952
But so far nothing I'm way overdue

266
00:17:56,373 --> 00:17:57,203
So?

267
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,109
Four Eyes was there yesterday

268
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,157
Saw her waving my ID around in

269
00:18:01,158 --> 00:18:02,196
front of everyone

270
00:18:02,427 --> 00:18:03,179
So embarrassing

271
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:04,911
Anyway, lend me $30

272
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:12,955
This is all can spare

273
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:16,994
I need $10 for myself

274
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:20,744
Pay you back next month

275
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:24,632
Let's have a late snack What?

276
00:18:25,052 --> 00:18:27,043
All I've had today is some won-ton noodles

277
00:18:28,142 --> 00:18:29,052
Let me finish writing this first

278
00:18:32,983 --> 00:18:35,053
I'm not sure I should tell you this

279
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:36,374
What?

280
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,549
I saw your wife in the street yesterday

281
00:18:39,914 --> 00:18:40,869
So what?

282
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:43,988
That is nothing

283
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:45,654
but she was with some guy

284
00:18:50,725 --> 00:18:51,714
Probably a friend

285
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:56,563
Just thought you should know

286
00:18:59,158 --> 00:19:02,074
Miss Yu? This is me

287
00:19:02,914 --> 00:19:04,829
Mr.Ho's still in a meeting

288
00:19:05,002 --> 00:19:06,913
he says he can't manage dinner

289
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,821
Yes, we're very busy now

290
00:19:13,309 --> 00:19:19,337
I'll, I'll ask Mr.Ho to call

291
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,950
Have you called Miss Yu? Yes, I've

292
00:19:27,552 --> 00:19:28,528
What did she say?

293
00:19:28,881 --> 00:19:30,550
Asks you to call her later

294
00:19:31,093 --> 00:19:33,344
And Mrs. Ho says she's ready to cut her birthday cake

295
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,848
She wants you to hurry home

296
00:19:35,142 --> 00:19:36,877
Did you get me something to give her? Yes, this

297
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:39,874
What is it? A scarf

298
00:19:40,444 --> 00:19:43,135
I think Mrs. Ho will like it Thank you

299
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:44,609
And here's your change

300
00:19:44,701 --> 00:19:47,600
I'm always troubling you

301
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:48,628
use it for bus fare

302
00:19:48,959 --> 00:19:51,495
Why don't you dine with us tonight?

303
00:19:51,923 --> 00:19:54,614
Thank you, I've already planned to see a film tonight

304
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:56,411
Then I won't keep you

305
00:19:57,141 --> 00:19:58,496
Tomorrow will be quiet

306
00:19:58,645 --> 00:20:00,055
take the morning off

307
00:20:02,276 --> 00:20:03,511
Goodbye goodbye

308
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,894
Are you going out tonight?

309
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,664
Don't forget your keys

310
00:20:16,194 --> 00:20:17,768
All the neighbors are dining out tonight

311
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:22,976
I have a lot to do here so I'll be late

312
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:39,457
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

313
00:20:40,122 --> 00:20:41,477
I heard voices

314
00:20:41,892 --> 00:20:43,545
I thought Mr.& Mrs. Koo were back

315
00:20:44,313 --> 00:20:47,127
Not yet, anything I can help with?

316
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:51,472
No, I just wanted a chat

317
00:20:52,537 --> 00:20:54,409
Are you alone? Yes, I am

318
00:20:58,047 --> 00:20:59,841
You're back early today

319
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:02,944
I'm not feeling well, I came back to rest

320
00:21:05,436 --> 00:21:08,231
What is it? I have some medicines

321
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:11,400
Don't trouble yourself, I'll sleep it off

322
00:21:14,077 --> 00:21:16,108
In that case, I'll leave you in peace

323
00:21:22,718 --> 00:21:23,787
It was your wife

324
00:21:26,907 --> 00:21:28,380
Have you spoken to your wife yet?

325
00:21:29,899 --> 00:21:31,168
Then we shouldn't meet any more

326
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,635
Any news from the Philippines?

327
00:22:21,245 --> 00:22:22,241
Yes, a telex

328
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:24,489
There's a typhoon, so the ship's still docked

329
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,696
Please inform Chan

330
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,935
That the shipment may be delayed

331
00:22:30,638 --> 00:22:31,882
Ask if that's a problem

332
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:36,953
Your wife rang

333
00:22:37,692 --> 00:22:38,981
you don't need to pick her up

334
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:40,669
She's playing mahjong with Mrs. Lau

335
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:43,168
She'll meet you at the restaurant at 5:30

336
00:22:47,168 --> 00:22:48,562
and there's a gift from Miss Yu

337
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:50,057
She was here?

338
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:51,835
No, she had it sent over

339
00:22:52,553 --> 00:22:54,602
She says she'll dine alone since it's your birthday

340
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:55,717
Please phone her

341
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,581
when you have a moment

342
00:23:00,861 --> 00:23:02,872
I'll get you another coffee Thank you

343
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:27,360
Thank you

344
00:23:33,129 --> 00:23:34,218
That tie looks good on you

345
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,810
You noticed?

346
00:23:38,014 --> 00:23:39,429
It's much like the old one

347
00:23:41,187 --> 00:23:42,555
You notice things if you pay attention

348
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:56,982
I'll be off now

349
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:58,634
If Chan has a problem

350
00:23:58,761 --> 00:24:00,672
let me know at the restaurant

351
00:24:01,391 --> 00:24:02,467
Why did you change your tie?

352
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,425
The new one was too showy

353
00:24:04,898 --> 00:24:06,201
I should stick with my own

354
00:24:06,651 --> 00:24:07,624
Don't forget to lock up

355
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,996
By the way, haven't seen your husband lately

356
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,535
He's abroad now, on company business

357
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:03,961
That's why I see you at the noodle stall

358
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:07,528
I don't like cooking for myself

359
00:26:09,172 --> 00:26:11,367
Haven't seen your wife lately either

360
00:26:12,596 --> 00:26:15,651
Her mother's ill, she's at home with her

361
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:17,987
That explains it

362
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:21,999
Good night Good night

363
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:24,657
Mrs. Chan, I'm glad you're back

364
00:26:24,843 --> 00:26:26,392
It's raining so hard

365
00:26:26,512 --> 00:26:28,868
I was going to look for you with and umbrella

366
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:30,376
You are too kind

367
00:26:30,447 --> 00:26:31,259
Amah, who is it?

368
00:26:31,274 --> 00:26:32,606
It's Mrs. Chan

369
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,522
Mrs. Suen

370
00:26:33,553 --> 00:26:35,702
Caught in the rain? I said you could

371
00:26:36,215 --> 00:26:38,890
eat with us

372
00:26:39,563 --> 00:26:41,255
Next time, Enjoy your game

373
00:26:43,946 --> 00:26:45,945
Her husband's always away

374
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,686
It's sad to see her to lonely

375
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:52,227
She dresses up like that to go out for noodle

376
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:05,816
Mr.Chow, What are you doing here?

377
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:08,362
Just calling Mrs. Koo to the phone

378
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:11,284
You're late back

379
00:27:12,373 --> 00:27:13,283
I went to the picture

380
00:27:14,754 --> 00:27:15,869
I'll be going

381
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:24,466
Hello

382
00:27:25,189 --> 00:27:26,668
Yes, please hold on

383
00:27:27,353 --> 00:27:29,227
Who is it? It's for Mrs. Chan

384
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:43,413
It must seem odd to ask you out but I want to ask something

385
00:27:44,744 --> 00:27:46,338
That handbag I saw you with this evening

386
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:47,931
Where did you buy it?

387
00:27:49,368 --> 00:27:50,683
Why do you ask?

388
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:54,546
It looked so elegant

389
00:27:54,745 --> 00:27:56,064
I want to get one for my wife

390
00:27:59,671 --> 00:28:01,582
Mr.Chow, you're so good to your wife

391
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:06,025
Not really, my wife is so fussy

392
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:07,560
Her birthday is two days away

393
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,134
I don't know what to get her

394
00:28:14,123 --> 00:28:15,332
Could you buy one for me to give her?

395
00:28:17,454 --> 00:28:20,690
Maybe she wouldn't want one just exactly the same

396
00:28:22,965 --> 00:28:25,199
You're right, I didn't think of that

397
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,129
Women would mind

398
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:31,990
Yes, especially since we're neighbors

399
00:28:34,654 --> 00:28:35,869
Do they come in other colors?

400
00:28:39,078 --> 00:28:40,716
I'd have to ask my husband

401
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:42,660
Why?

402
00:28:43,879 --> 00:28:44,470
He bought it for me

403
00:28:45,214 --> 00:28:46,408
on a business trip abroad

404
00:28:47,469 --> 00:28:48,822
They aren't on sale here

405
00:28:53,313 --> 00:28:54,143
Then never mind

406
00:29:01,662 --> 00:29:02,538
Actually

407
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,268
I want to ask your something too

408
00:29:07,006 --> 00:29:07,882
What?

409
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,068
Where did you buy your tie?

410
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:15,221
I don't know where it came from

411
00:29:16,189 --> 00:29:18,000
My wife buys all my ties

412
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:19,545
Really?

413
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:26,516
She bought this one

414
00:29:26,517 --> 00:29:27,506
on a business trip abroad

415
00:29:28,554 --> 00:29:29,769
It's not on sale here

416
00:29:31,593 --> 00:29:32,867
What a coincidence

417
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:36,790
Yes

418
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:43,689
Actually

419
00:29:46,705 --> 00:29:49,041
My husband has one just like it

420
00:29:50,629 --> 00:29:52,582
He said it was a gift from his boss

421
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:54,738
So he wears it every day

422
00:30:00,272 --> 00:30:02,249
Any my wife has a bag just like yours

423
00:30:03,687 --> 00:30:05,661
I know, I have seen it

424
00:30:09,164 --> 00:30:10,319
What are you getting at, actually?

425
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,006
I thought I was the only one who knew

426
00:30:44,723 --> 00:30:46,133
I wonder how it began

427
00:31:02,756 --> 00:31:06,068
It's late, won't your wife complain?

428
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,895
She's used to it, she doesn't care

429
00:31:11,581 --> 00:31:14,000
And your husband?

430
00:31:15,204 --> 00:31:16,273
He must be asleep by now

431
00:31:20,498 --> 00:31:21,833
Shall we stay out tonight?

432
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:31,290
My husband would never say that

433
00:31:34,858 --> 00:31:35,868
What would he say?

434
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:38,265
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that

435
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,394
Someone must have made the first move

436
00:31:42,748 --> 00:31:44,147
Who else could it be?

437
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,738
It's late, won't your wife complain?

438
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:55,883
She's used to it, she doesn't care

439
00:31:57,568 --> 00:31:58,800
And your husband?

440
00:32:00,322 --> 00:32:01,550
He must be asleep by now

441
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:24,900
I can't say it

442
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,796
I understand

443
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,300
After all, it's already happened

444
00:32:36,332 --> 00:32:37,527
It doesn't matter who made the first move

445
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,585
Do you really know your wife?

446
00:33:15,055 --> 00:33:16,300
You order for me

447
00:33:17,083 --> 00:33:17,833
Why?

448
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,776
I've no idea what your wife likes

449
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:36,241
What about your husband?

450
00:34:18,157 --> 00:34:19,212
Like it hot?

451
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:24,912
Your wife likes hot dishes

452
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,732
Why did you call me at the office today?

453
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,700
I had nothing to do, I want to hear your voice

454
00:35:08,852 --> 00:35:10,521
You have my husband down pat

455
00:35:10,856 --> 00:35:12,162
He's real sweet-talker

456
00:35:39,676 --> 00:35:41,145
Why didn't you call me today?

457
00:35:42,697 --> 00:35:43,952
I was afraid you won't like it

458
00:35:46,622 --> 00:35:48,116
Then don't call me again

459
00:36:04,472 --> 00:36:08,664
Mrs. Chan, a letter from your husband

460
00:36:10,132 --> 00:36:12,162
It's not for me, it's for Mr.Chow next door

461
00:36:13,363 --> 00:36:14,778
The Japanese stamp made me think

462
00:36:14,825 --> 00:36:16,374
it was your husband

463
00:36:17,438 --> 00:36:18,687
So I was wrong

464
00:36:35,597 --> 00:36:36,866
Your wife's in Japan?

465
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:40,383
How did you know?

466
00:36:43,069 --> 00:36:44,279
What did she say in her letter?

467
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:46,385
Nothing special

468
00:36:48,871 --> 00:36:50,265
Anything about when she'd be back?

469
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:53,354
No

470
00:36:54,799 --> 00:36:56,373
What do you think they're doing right now?

471
00:37:33,342 --> 00:37:35,346
Are you alright? I'm fine

472
00:37:36,944 --> 00:37:38,273
Please pull up here

473
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:39,999
Why?

474
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:41,992
I'll get off first

475
00:37:43,598 --> 00:37:44,907
No, let me

476
00:38:48,229 --> 00:38:50,482
Mrs. Chan Ah Ping, you're back

477
00:38:50,534 --> 00:38:52,211
Visiting Mr.Chow?

478
00:38:52,687 --> 00:38:55,164
Yes, I thought we'd have lunch but he isn't well

479
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:56,361
What's wrong with him?

480
00:38:56,736 --> 00:38:58,755
He's got fever, he's all alone

481
00:38:58,823 --> 00:39:01,903
So I'm gonna buy him something to eat

482
00:39:02,123 --> 00:39:03,832
The congee downstairs is quite good

483
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:05,213
He doesn't want congee

484
00:39:06,003 --> 00:39:06,992
What does he want?

485
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:09,876
Can't taste anything, so he wants sesame syrup

486
00:39:10,094 --> 00:39:11,124
Damned troublesome

487
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:19,161
Amah

488
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,997
Mrs. Suen, she's hanging the washing on the roof

489
00:39:22,618 --> 00:39:23,275
You're back

490
00:39:23,912 --> 00:39:24,993
Yes, you've been out?

491
00:39:25,122 --> 00:39:28,619
My mother's birthday is coming up

492
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:30,707
So I took her to buy some fabric

493
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,774
It took all day, I'm half dead

494
00:39:34,323 --> 00:39:35,792
And I had my hair done, is it nice?

495
00:39:35,892 --> 00:39:36,722
Very nice

496
00:39:37,562 --> 00:39:38,535
What are you cooking?

497
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:41,527
I had a sudden craving for sesame syrup

498
00:39:42,822 --> 00:39:45,017
That whole pot is for you

499
00:39:45,953 --> 00:39:48,002
I thought I might as well make a potful

500
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:50,461
You're so thoughtful

501
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:53,997
Please try it I'll

502
00:39:54,461 --> 00:39:55,497
What a coincidence

503
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,135
Going out?

504
00:39:57,867 --> 00:40:00,997
I'll buy some noodles, I'm starving

505
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,218
Hungary? Will you join me?

506
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:04,729
No thanks

507
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,116
Just off work?

508
00:40:07,593 --> 00:40:08,784
You must be very busy

509
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:12,812
Actually, I've been to see a picture

510
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,349
Really? How was it?

511
00:40:15,908 --> 00:40:17,109
So-so

512
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,935
I used to like going to the pictures

513
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:21,367
You had many hobbies before

514
00:40:21,436 --> 00:40:25,173
On your own, you are free to do lots of things

515
00:40:25,669 --> 00:40:27,274
Everything changes when you marry

516
00:40:27,598 --> 00:40:29,672
It must be decided together

517
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,165
Right?

518
00:40:34,218 --> 00:40:36,000
I sometimes wonder what I'd be

519
00:40:36,001 --> 00:40:36,992
if I hadn't married

520
00:40:37,842 --> 00:40:38,897
Have you ever thought of that?

521
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,835
Maybe happier

522
00:40:47,776 --> 00:40:48,731
I didn't know married life would be

523
00:40:48,778 --> 00:40:50,233
so complicated

524
00:40:52,192 --> 00:40:55,300
When you're single, you are only responsible to yourself

525
00:40:56,750 --> 00:40:58,519
Once you're married

526
00:40:59,091 --> 00:41:01,142
doing well on your own is not enough

527
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:07,999
Don't brood on it, maybe he'll be back soon

528
00:41:12,113 --> 00:41:13,082
What about you?

529
00:41:13,782 --> 00:41:15,111
Actually, we're in the same boat

530
00:41:18,617 --> 00:41:19,991
But I don't brood on it

531
00:41:21,698 --> 00:41:22,899
It's not my fault

532
00:41:24,135 --> 00:41:26,151
I can't waste time wondering if I made mistakes

533
00:41:27,129 --> 00:41:28,423
Life's too short for that

534
00:41:30,333 --> 00:41:31,544
Something must change

535
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,764
So what's your plan?

536
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:39,250
I want to write a martial-arts

537
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,270
serial...

538
00:41:40,418 --> 00:41:43,588
Actually, I've started one, I'll show it to you

539
00:41:44,715 --> 00:41:45,545
Great

540
00:41:46,844 --> 00:41:47,950
You like them too

541
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,000
so why not help me write it?

542
00:41:49,517 --> 00:41:53,129
I wouldn't know how, I only read them

543
00:41:53,625 --> 00:41:54,935
We would discuss it together

544
00:41:57,206 --> 00:41:58,680
Alright, I'll try my best

545
00:42:00,271 --> 00:42:02,000
I never thanked you for the sesame syrup

546
00:42:02,341 --> 00:42:06,158
There's no need I was making it anyway

547
00:42:07,217 --> 00:42:08,750
Amazing, I was craving for some

548
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,943
sesame syrup that day

549
00:42:11,642 --> 00:42:13,190
Really? What's a coincidence

550
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:15,524
It really was

551
00:42:17,461 --> 00:42:18,889
I'll go for those noodles

552
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:46,120
Again, halfway through dinner, he's drunk

553
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,555
Disgusting

554
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:55,677
- I told you to stop - What can you do?

555
00:45:01,042 --> 00:45:01,555
It's me

556
00:45:02,252 --> 00:45:03,368
You scared me

557
00:45:04,006 --> 00:45:05,241
How's Mr.Koo?

558
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:07,004
Drunk, as usual

559
00:45:16,796 --> 00:45:17,891
I didn't expect them back so early

560
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:23,770
Since you're trapped here, finish the noodles

561
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:28,933
They'll probably go soon

562
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:41,610
Want some soup?

563
00:45:45,166 --> 00:45:46,421
Want some soup?

564
00:45:57,983 --> 00:46:00,599
Mrs. Suen, playing here tonight

565
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,981
Yes, Mrs. Koo is dealing with her husband

566
00:46:04,879 --> 00:46:07,315
I could do that

567
00:46:07,443 --> 00:46:08,932
No, we should not trouble you

568
00:46:11,173 --> 00:46:12,926
Think you'll play all night?

569
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,378
No, we'll just play eight rounds

570
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,583
They'll play till morning?

571
00:46:23,538 --> 00:46:24,927
Mrs. Suen says only eight rounds

572
00:46:26,169 --> 00:46:27,258
You believe that?

573
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:36,728
You get some rest, I'll wake you when they leave

574
00:46:37,982 --> 00:46:38,778
And you?

575
00:46:39,403 --> 00:46:40,658
I have a chapter to finish

576
00:46:54,857 --> 00:46:56,113
Where have you got to?

577
00:46:56,894 --> 00:46:57,949
The drunken master just showed up

578
00:46:58,547 --> 00:47:00,282
When did he get written in?

579
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:02,707
Just now

580
00:47:26,308 --> 00:47:28,480
Mr.Chow, home so early?

581
00:47:28,694 --> 00:47:30,373
I went out to buy some food

582
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:31,616
No work today?

583
00:47:31,734 --> 00:47:33,459
I didn't feel so good, I'm staying home

584
00:47:33,594 --> 00:47:35,669
A sick man shouldn't eat all that sticky rice

585
00:47:35,899 --> 00:47:37,704
Some of it's for later

586
00:47:37,870 --> 00:47:39,809
Don't stuff yourself

587
00:47:40,826 --> 00:47:41,326
Good morning

588
00:47:41,328 --> 00:47:42,943
Good morning, finished your game?

589
00:47:42,999 --> 00:47:46,766
Not yet, but Mr.Yang has to work

590
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,823
Mr.Tsai is coming to replace him

591
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:51,879
Did you call the office for me?

592
00:47:52,898 --> 00:47:53,689
Yes

593
00:47:53,850 --> 00:47:54,766
What did you tell them?

594
00:47:55,481 --> 00:47:56,747
That you weren't feeling well

595
00:47:58,893 --> 00:48:00,209
Did them ask who you were?

596
00:48:00,805 --> 00:48:01,623
No

597
00:48:05,163 --> 00:48:06,657
Probably took me for your husband

598
00:48:07,994 --> 00:48:10,127
Mr.Ho knows that he's away

599
00:48:11,225 --> 00:48:12,701
Pretend he's come back

600
00:48:21,961 --> 00:48:23,176
Maybe we're being too cautious?

601
00:48:23,931 --> 00:48:25,346
I'm always round anyway

602
00:48:25,995 --> 00:48:27,184
We shouldn't have panicked

603
00:48:29,718 --> 00:48:32,832
Well, they did turn up without warning

604
00:48:33,141 --> 00:48:34,451
What would they assume?

605
00:48:37,867 --> 00:48:39,600
We can't put a foot wrong

606
00:49:19,069 --> 00:49:20,524
You can go

607
00:49:45,509 --> 00:49:48,400
Amah Mrs. Chan, you're back very late

608
00:49:48,407 --> 00:49:50,640
I had a lot of work today

609
00:49:51,078 --> 00:49:53,548
I didn't see you leave this morning

610
00:49:53,774 --> 00:49:55,863
I had breakfast with my mother

611
00:49:55,903 --> 00:49:57,558
You weren't here when I left

612
00:49:59,643 --> 00:50:00,580
Where's Mrs. Suen?

613
00:50:00,995 --> 00:50:04,292
Asleep, she played mahjong all day

614
00:50:04,303 --> 00:50:06,595
Be quiet, don't wake her Alright

615
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:09,300
Mrs. Chan, is your leg alright?

616
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,615
It's these new shoes

617
00:50:57,569 --> 00:50:59,241
Why a special dinner tonight?

618
00:51:00,074 --> 00:51:03,090
Since you won't take your share of

619
00:51:03,105 --> 00:51:04,460
the writing fee

620
00:51:05,501 --> 00:51:06,692
None of my business

621
00:51:06,762 --> 00:51:08,256
All I did was give you some thoughts

622
00:51:09,683 --> 00:51:11,102
Someone else is asking for a serial too

623
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,429
There'll be more work soon

624
00:51:13,659 --> 00:51:16,336
Really? So quickly

625
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:17,521
Isn't the workload too much?

626
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,699
That's why I'm looking for a new place

627
00:51:21,297 --> 00:51:22,331
What for?

628
00:51:23,586 --> 00:51:24,855
To write in

629
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:28,146
lt'll be more convenient

630
00:51:28,803 --> 00:51:30,761
There's nothing between us

631
00:51:31,325 --> 00:51:32,794
but I don't want gossip

632
00:51:34,706 --> 00:51:35,997
What do you think?

633
00:51:37,536 --> 00:51:39,455
Why waste money?

634
00:51:40,149 --> 00:51:41,950
You don't need me

635
00:51:42,521 --> 00:51:44,270
you can write on your own

636
00:52:24,173 --> 00:52:25,965
Who do you want?

637
00:52:26,277 --> 00:52:27,576
Chow Mo-Wan?

638
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:29,792
He hasn't been in for several days

639
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,349
We're looking for him too

640
00:52:37,639 --> 00:52:39,554
May I know who's calling?

641
00:52:42,466 --> 00:52:43,815
Any message?

642
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:47,861
It's no trouble, goodbye

643
00:53:00,433 --> 00:53:02,525
Please get this to Accounts

644
00:53:02,687 --> 00:53:04,520
And have the air-conditioner serviced tomorrow

645
00:53:05,326 --> 00:53:06,402
Mr.Ho

646
00:53:08,172 --> 00:53:10,000
No need to stay if everything's done

647
00:53:10,185 --> 00:53:12,104
I'll lock up Yes

648
00:53:23,819 --> 00:53:24,410
Hello?

649
00:53:30,706 --> 00:53:31,858
Where are you?

650
00:54:36,228 --> 00:54:37,604
I'll come again tomorrow

651
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,292
No need, I'll be alright after some rest

652
00:54:41,873 --> 00:54:43,692
It's no trouble

653
00:54:44,569 --> 00:54:46,621
I'll bring you some food, what would you like?

654
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:48,316
Whatever

655
00:54:49,154 --> 00:54:52,190
Then I'll leave now, get some rest

656
00:54:52,518 --> 00:54:53,953
Call me when you get home

657
00:54:54,614 --> 00:54:57,520
Let it ring three times then hang up

658
00:54:59,080 --> 00:54:59,799
Alright

659
00:55:07,011 --> 00:55:08,326
I didn't think you'd come

660
00:55:12,558 --> 00:55:14,482
We won't be like them

661
00:55:16,737 --> 00:55:17,510
See you tomorrow

662
00:57:33,911 --> 00:57:35,610
Tell me honestly

663
00:57:38,262 --> 00:57:39,977
Do you have a mistress?

664
00:57:42,987 --> 00:57:43,997
You're crazy

665
00:57:47,362 --> 00:57:48,517
Who told you I had?

666
00:57:49,124 --> 00:57:50,334
Never mind who

667
00:57:51,636 --> 00:57:53,110
Do you or don't you?

668
00:57:56,144 --> 00:57:56,933
No

669
00:58:02,891 --> 00:58:04,146
Don't lie

670
00:58:05,964 --> 00:58:10,243
Look at me

671
00:58:12,509 --> 00:58:14,620
I'm asking you, do you have a mistress

672
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:20,580
Yes

673
00:58:26,886 --> 00:58:28,191
That's no reaction

674
00:58:29,399 --> 00:58:31,949
If he admits it outright

675
00:58:32,922 --> 00:58:34,511
let him have it

676
00:58:37,539 --> 00:58:39,750
I wasn't expecting he would admit it so easily

677
00:58:41,630 --> 00:58:43,183
I didn't know how to react

678
00:58:46,013 --> 00:58:47,128
One more time, alright?

679
00:59:05,007 --> 00:59:06,918
Tell me frankly

680
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:09,708
Do you have a mistress?

681
00:59:13,899 --> 00:59:14,775
You're crazy

682
00:59:20,704 --> 00:59:21,773
Who told you that?

683
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:26,997
Never mind that, do you or don't you?

684
00:59:32,684 --> 00:59:33,480
No

685
00:59:36,441 --> 00:59:37,696
Don't lie

686
00:59:38,487 --> 00:59:39,636
Tell me

687
00:59:41,409 --> 00:59:44,681
Look at me, do you have a mistress?

688
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,476
Yes

689
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,229
Are you alright?

690
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:29,440
I didn't expect it to hurt so much

691
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:42,267
This is just a rehearsal

692
01:00:45,112 --> 01:00:46,527
He won't really admit it so readily

693
01:00:47,825 --> 01:00:51,181
It's alright, don't take it so hard

694
01:00:56,174 --> 01:00:57,463
You've been out a lot lately

695
01:00:58,387 --> 01:00:59,342
Yes

696
01:01:02,018 --> 01:01:05,328
It's right to enjoy yourself while you're young

697
01:01:06,694 --> 01:01:07,763
But don't overdo it

698
01:01:11,619 --> 01:01:12,768
When will your husband be back?

699
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:14,988
Soon

700
01:01:17,556 --> 01:01:21,000
In future, don't let him travel so much

701
01:01:22,014 --> 01:01:24,926
A couple should spend time together

702
01:01:26,230 --> 01:01:27,379
Don't you agree?

703
01:01:30,138 --> 01:01:31,123
Good night

704
01:01:53,039 --> 01:01:54,108
Will you come over tonight?

705
01:01:55,126 --> 01:01:55,922
What for?

706
01:01:56,588 --> 01:01:58,465
The editor's hounding me, he says I'm too slow

707
01:01:59,384 --> 01:02:01,261
I need your help, when can you come?

708
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:04,810
Not anytime soon

709
01:02:05,563 --> 01:02:06,552
Why not?

710
01:02:07,775 --> 01:02:09,991
Mrs. Suen lectured me last night

711
01:02:11,073 --> 01:02:11,864
What did he say?

712
01:02:12,785 --> 01:02:13,661
Rather not say

713
01:02:14,830 --> 01:02:16,741
We shouldn't see so much of each other

714
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,715
Mrs. Chan, going out for noodles again?

715
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:32,206
Not tonight, I'll make myself something

716
01:02:33,156 --> 01:02:34,509
Join us, we're having vegetable won-tons

717
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:43,546
Alright

718
01:05:15,294 --> 01:05:17,203
- No lunch today, Mr.Ho? - No

719
01:05:19,442 --> 01:05:20,657
Now one Mr.Zhou call you

720
01:05:21,571 --> 01:05:22,626
He wants you to call him back

721
01:05:26,498 --> 01:05:27,333
Thank you

722
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,149
- Back from work? - Yes

723
01:06:04,402 --> 01:06:06,911
- Strange weather Isn't it - Yes

724
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:08,576
Been here long?

725
01:06:09,161 --> 01:06:10,071
Just a while

726
01:06:13,252 --> 01:06:14,287
I don't think it'll stop soon

727
01:06:17,302 --> 01:06:18,132
Wait for me

728
01:06:47,108 --> 01:06:48,063
I'll see you home

729
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,357
We'd better not be seen together

730
01:06:54,162 --> 01:06:55,438
Then you go first

731
01:06:58,295 --> 01:06:59,564
If they see your umbrella

732
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:02,611
They'll know I was with you

733
01:07:04,974 --> 01:07:06,327
I wasn't thinking

734
01:07:10,192 --> 01:07:13,343
You go first, I'll wait a while

735
01:07:15,368 --> 01:07:16,323
I'll keep you company

736
01:07:39,338 --> 01:07:40,214
Did you try to call me?

737
01:07:43,012 --> 01:07:44,604
I wasn't sure you got the message

738
01:07:46,518 --> 01:07:47,428
Could you get me a boat ticker?

739
01:07:50,693 --> 01:07:51,682
To where?

740
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:54,812
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore

741
01:07:56,453 --> 01:07:59,809
They're short of staff, he'd like me to go and help

742
01:08:04,217 --> 01:08:05,127
How long will you stay?

743
01:08:06,221 --> 01:08:08,291
Don't know, I'll play it be ear

744
01:08:13,777 --> 01:08:15,654
Why rush off to Singapore?

745
01:08:17,785 --> 01:08:18,695
A change of scene...

746
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:22,674
I've had enough of the gossip

747
01:08:25,132 --> 01:08:27,009
We know it's not true, so why worry?

748
01:08:31,227 --> 01:08:32,262
I used to think that too

749
01:08:34,090 --> 01:08:35,284
and it didn't worry me

750
01:08:39,275 --> 01:08:40,549
I thought we wouldn't be like them

751
01:08:45,567 --> 01:08:46,372
But I was wrong

752
01:08:49,778 --> 01:08:51,233
You won't leave your husband

753
01:08:54,590 --> 01:08:55,705
So I'd rather go away

754
01:09:03,356 --> 01:09:04,994
I didn't think you'd fall in love with me

755
01:09:06,904 --> 01:09:07,893
I didn't either

756
01:09:13,792 --> 01:09:15,769
I was only curious to know how it started

757
01:09:17,465 --> 01:09:18,500
Now I know

758
01:09:20,848 --> 01:09:22,501
Feelings can creep up just like that

759
01:09:27,318 --> 01:09:28,328
I thought I was in control

760
01:09:29,989 --> 01:09:31,900
But I hate to think of our husband coming home

761
01:09:33,454 --> 01:09:34,489
I wish he'd stay away

762
01:09:36,751 --> 01:09:37,861
I'm so bad

763
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,166
Will you do me one favour?

764
01:09:45,184 --> 01:09:46,039
What?

765
01:09:47,981 --> 01:09:49,096
I want to be prepared

766
01:10:46,508 --> 01:10:47,718
You'd better not see me again

767
01:10:53,312 --> 01:10:54,627
Is your husband back?

768
01:10:55,942 --> 01:10:56,852
Yes

769
01:10:59,282 --> 01:11:00,476
Am I hopeless?

770
01:11:03,372 --> 01:11:04,327
Not really

771
01:11:15,229 --> 01:11:16,703
I won't see you again

772
01:11:19,445 --> 01:11:20,764
Keep a closer eye on your husband

773
01:12:02,065 --> 01:12:02,895
Please

774
01:12:04,946 --> 01:12:06,538
Don't be serious it's only a rehearsal

775
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:09,534
Don't cry

776
01:12:14,506 --> 01:12:15,621
This isn't real

777
01:13:06,604 --> 01:13:08,037
I don't want to go home tonight

778
01:13:35,324 --> 01:13:37,819
Mei-Yi wants to dedicate a song

779
01:13:38,214 --> 01:13:39,529
to her honeymooning friends

780
01:13:39,866 --> 01:13:41,865
And Mrs. Cheung wishes the best to

781
01:13:42,420 --> 01:13:43,929
her neighbors

782
01:13:45,384 --> 01:13:47,495
And Mr.Chan, now on business in Japan

783
01:13:47,973 --> 01:13:50,343
wants to wish his wife

784
01:13:50,936 --> 01:13:53,206
a happy birthday

785
01:13:54,109 --> 01:13:56,745
So let's all enjoy Zhou Xuan singing

786
01:13:56,948 --> 01:13:58,740
In Full Bloom

787
01:15:39,724 --> 01:15:40,634
It's me

788
01:15:42,275 --> 01:15:43,804
If there's an extra ticket

789
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:46,806
Would you go with me?

790
01:18:15,688 --> 01:18:16,518
It's me

791
01:18:18,275 --> 01:18:19,424
If there's an extra ticket

792
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:21,925
Would you go with me?

793
01:18:36,952 --> 01:18:41,128
Mr.Chow has gone to work

794
01:18:42,119 --> 01:18:43,682
Any message?

795
01:18:44,992 --> 01:18:47,041
You're welcome

796
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,151
Has anyone been in my room?

797
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:19,340
No

798
01:19:19,933 --> 01:19:21,343
Something's missing

799
01:19:21,687 --> 01:19:22,797
What?

800
01:19:53,153 --> 01:19:56,729
In the old days

801
01:19:57,494 --> 01:20:00,831
If someone had a secret they didn't want to share

802
01:20:01,544 --> 01:20:02,799
You know what they did?

803
01:20:04,132 --> 01:20:05,287
Have no idea

804
01:20:09,475 --> 01:20:11,224
They went up to a mountain, found a tree

805
01:20:13,399 --> 01:20:14,894
Carved a hole in it

806
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:17,603
And whispered the secret into the hole

807
01:20:19,160 --> 01:20:20,839
Then they covered it with mud

808
01:20:22,959 --> 01:20:26,999
And leave the secret there forever

809
01:20:29,596 --> 01:20:33,432
What a pain, I'd just go to get laid

810
01:20:36,902 --> 01:20:37,891
Not everyone's like you

811
01:20:40,033 --> 01:20:41,807
I'm just an average guy

812
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:43,908
I don't have secrets like you

813
01:20:44,332 --> 01:20:46,991
You bottle things up

814
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,515
Tell me something

815
01:20:49,843 --> 01:20:50,719
I don't have secrets

816
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:55,148
Come off it, buddy

817
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,349
I won't tell anyone

818
01:23:26,378 --> 01:23:27,554
Hello, Singapore Daily

819
01:23:28,799 --> 01:23:29,675
Hold on

820
01:23:31,070 --> 01:23:32,139
Mr.Chow, call for you

821
01:23:33,224 --> 01:23:33,876
Thanks

822
01:23:37,248 --> 01:23:38,164
Hello

823
01:23:43,951 --> 01:23:44,834
Hello

824
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:36,572
- Who is it? - It is me

825
01:24:38,246 --> 01:24:40,596
- Mrs. Chan, long time no see - Yes

826
01:24:41,377 --> 01:24:42,805
- Amah, who's there? - Mrs. Suen

827
01:24:42,920 --> 01:24:45,309
What brings you here?

828
01:24:45,387 --> 01:24:47,203
It's been a while

829
01:24:47,397 --> 01:24:48,827
I was nearby

830
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:50,702
so I thought I'd bring your boat ticket

831
01:24:51,822 --> 01:24:52,545
And a small gift

832
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:55,742
You shouldn't have, it's nice just to see you

833
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,017
The place is in such a mess

834
01:24:58,251 --> 01:24:59,122
Already started packing?

835
01:24:59,545 --> 01:25:01,503
It's hopeless,

836
01:25:02,049 --> 01:25:05,655
I can't bear to throw things away

837
01:25:05,863 --> 01:25:09,456
- Let's find you a seat - OK

838
01:25:13,487 --> 01:25:15,037
- Have some tea - Thank you

839
01:25:15,893 --> 01:25:20,452
Eat with us, Mrs. Chan, I'm going to the market

840
01:25:22,395 --> 01:25:24,870
I can't, I have work waiting

841
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:27,605
Don't rush off

842
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:29,768
if you don't eat here

843
01:25:30,211 --> 01:25:33,422
Mrs. Suen will be upset

844
01:25:33,423 --> 01:25:34,926
Amah, pour me some tea too

845
01:25:37,106 --> 01:25:38,300
How's your husband?

846
01:25:38,660 --> 01:25:40,000
He's fine, thank you

847
01:25:40,964 --> 01:25:42,000
How long will you be away?

848
01:25:43,193 --> 01:25:44,248
I don't know

849
01:25:44,437 --> 01:25:46,692
If I like it, I might stay

850
01:25:47,860 --> 01:25:48,733
Why?

851
01:25:48,988 --> 01:25:51,838
My daughter worries about the situation in Hong Kong

852
01:25:51,885 --> 01:25:54,496
She worry about I stay alone in Hong Kong

853
01:25:54,591 --> 01:25:57,752
I don't want to leave

854
01:25:57,788 --> 01:26:00,743
Since the Koos left

855
01:26:00,994 --> 01:26:04,111
I don't have my mahjong partners anymore

856
01:26:04,642 --> 01:26:10,221
And my daughter needs help with her kids in the US

857
01:26:13,626 --> 01:26:15,041
What about this place?

858
01:26:15,664 --> 01:26:18,117
I'm not sure

859
01:26:20,003 --> 01:26:21,777
I don't want to sell it

860
01:26:23,870 --> 01:26:25,403
So I might rent it out

861
01:26:26,259 --> 01:26:27,998
How much would you want?

862
01:26:28,790 --> 01:26:31,318
You're interested?

863
01:26:31,477 --> 01:26:36,256
You could have it at a discount

864
01:26:36,869 --> 01:26:37,687
I'll think about it

865
01:26:38,039 --> 01:26:39,315
Mrs. Suen, your tea

866
01:26:41,251 --> 01:26:43,708
Who lives next door now?

867
01:26:44,101 --> 01:26:48,591
I don't really know them

868
01:26:48,726 --> 01:26:54,857
The Koos were almost like family

869
01:26:54,888 --> 01:27:00,027
It was so nice then

870
01:27:00,205 --> 01:27:01,535
wasn't it?

871
01:27:02,042 --> 01:27:03,174
Yes

872
01:27:04,930 --> 01:27:06,085
Let's sit over here

873
01:27:33,001 --> 01:27:33,592
Yes?

874
01:27:34,378 --> 01:27:35,288
Is Mr.Koo in?

875
01:27:35,882 --> 01:27:37,952
He moved long ago

876
01:27:39,180 --> 01:27:40,169
Do you know where he is?

877
01:27:41,767 --> 01:27:42,597
You know him well?

878
01:27:44,105 --> 01:27:45,015
I used to live here

879
01:27:46,860 --> 01:27:47,990
Is Mrs. Suen still next door?

880
01:27:49,031 --> 01:27:51,640
She's gone, it's too chaotic

881
01:27:52,396 --> 01:27:53,895
Everyone's running away

882
01:27:54,958 --> 01:27:56,152
So who lives there now?

883
01:27:57,212 --> 01:27:58,281
I am not sure

884
01:27:59,008 --> 01:28:00,582
A woman and her son

885
01:28:01,889 --> 01:28:03,317
The kid is cute

886
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:08,607
No address in the Philippines

887
01:28:09,736 --> 01:28:10,871
Just his son's phone number

888
01:28:12,325 --> 01:28:14,316
- I can't accept this - How this

889
01:28:14,954 --> 01:28:15,989
Please, you must

890
01:28:17,542 --> 01:28:20,534
- Thank you, then - Bye

891
01:28:31,571 --> 01:28:32,897
That era has passed

892
01:28:32,897 --> 01:28:35,071
Nothing that belonged to

893
01:28:35,071 --> 01:28:36,385
it exists any more

894
01:28:37,538 --> 01:28:38,632
Are you ready?

895
01:28:39,059 --> 01:28:40,498
- Okay - Let's go

896
01:28:57,209 --> 01:29:01,621
The presidential corps waits at Pochentong Airport

897
01:29:02,219 --> 01:29:06,547
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and Queen sisowath Kossamak

898
01:29:06,594 --> 01:29:08,590
come forward to greet General De Gaulle

899
01:29:15,833 --> 01:29:21,185
It's ten kilometres from Pochentong to Phnom Penh

900
01:29:22,173 --> 01:29:24,480
200,000 people line the route

901
01:29:24,665 --> 01:29:27,210
A welcome unprecedented in the history of the Kingdom
