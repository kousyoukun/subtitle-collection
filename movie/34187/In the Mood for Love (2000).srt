lt is a restless moment.

11
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,395
She has kept her head lowered...

12
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:04,230
to give him a chance to come closer.

13
00:01:04,314 --> 00:01:05,982
But he could not, for lack of courage.

14
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,734
She turns and walks away.

Sorry to interrupt your dinner.

18
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,629
Never mind. Let's sit over here.

You can call me Mrs. Suen.

- l will.

25
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,813
Did you write down my number?

26
00:01:45,898 --> 00:01:47,148
Yes, l did.

27
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,941
Fine, l'll see you out.

28
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:52,028
- Don't trouble.
- No trouble!

29
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,581
So it's agreed then!

30
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:05,166
Thank you very much! l should go.

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,250

Sorry, it's just been rented
to that lady.

35
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:16,427
Thanks anyway.

36
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:19,013
How many of you?

37
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,015
Just me and my wife.

38
00:02:21,683 --> 00:02:23,309
Why don't you try next door?

39
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,519
They've a vacant room too?

40
00:02:24,603 --> 00:02:30,566
Yes, Mr. Koo's son got married.
His room's empty.

41
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:32,109
Thank you.

42
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:33,986
You're too polite. Try asking them.

43
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,071
Thank you.

44
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,787
This way. Come on.

45
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:44,163
Not that room!

46
00:02:44,248 --> 00:02:46,123
Oops, wrong again!

47
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,879
Careful! Against the wall there.

48
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,428
The little cupboard over there.

49
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,721
Be careful!

50
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,432
Don't break anything!

51
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:05,852
Not on top of the radio!

52
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:07,228
Mr. Chow...

53
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,313
you have a lot of stuff for a couple!

54
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:12,191
- The wardrobe isn't mine.
- Wrong again?

55
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:13,526
lt goes next door.

56
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,862
Okay, next door.

57
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:21,117
These aren't my shoes!
They must go next door.

58
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,871
What a coincidence!
Moving in on the same day!

59
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:27,540
ls Mr. Chan here?

60
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:30,626
He's working abroad.
He'll be back next week.

61
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,170
You should have waited, then.

62
00:03:33,839 --> 00:03:36,549
lt's too much for you on your own.

63
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,260
- l can manage.
- l'll ask Amah to help.

64
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,220
No need. l can manage.

65
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,889
What's going on?

66
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:45,224
Mind that mirror!

67
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,018
Mrs. Chan, l'll leave you to it.

68
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,402
- Those books aren't mine.
- Wrong again?

69
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,070
Never mind. Just leave them there.

70
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,781
Mind how you hang the mirror.
lt's fragile!

71
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:02,825
Are these magazines yours?

72
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,912
Yes, they're my husband's.

73
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,663
He reads Japanese?

74
00:04:07,748 --> 00:04:09,832
A little. His boss is Japanese.

75
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:11,584
How should l address you?

76
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:12,919
My husband's name is Chan.

77
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,754
My name's Chow.
l'll leave you in peace.

78
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:16,213
Thank you, Mr. Chow.

79
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:17,381
Don't mention it.

80
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,802
l'll ask Mrs. Chan.

81
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,266
Mrs. Chan,
eat with us before you go!

82
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,019
No, thanks.
l must dash to the airport.

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,355
- Your husband's coming back?
- Yes.

84
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:34,315
Then l won't keep you.

85
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,777
- Going out?
- Yes.

86
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,615
Sorry l'm late!

87
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,784
Amah, pour some beer.

88
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:45,952
Cheers!

89
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:50,790
Mrs. Chow,
try some Shanghai dishes.

90
00:04:50,874 --> 00:04:53,876
Where is Mrs. Chan off to so late?

91
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,838
Meeting her husband at the airport.

92
00:04:57,923 --> 00:04:59,632
So that's why she looks different.

93
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,027
lt's all packed.
Take care on your trip.

94
00:06:01,111 --> 00:06:02,361
l will.

95
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,367
How long this time?

96
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,453
Two to four weeks.

97
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,541
Remember to bring back
two more of those handbags.

98
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:16,751
Who for?

99
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:17,960
My boss.

100
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,420
Two of them?

101
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:21,088
You know why.

102
00:06:21,173 --> 00:06:23,007
Different colors?

103
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,469
The same will do! Who cares?

104
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,804
Whatever!

105
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:45,321
Mrs. Ho.
Mr. Ho is still in a meeting.

106
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,532
He'll be home late.
Please don't wait to eat.

107
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:53,370
Yes. We're so busy at the moment.

108
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,958
Yes. l'll ask him to call you
when he gets back.

109
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,677
Did you call my wife?

110
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:11,388
Yes, l said you'd be back later.

111
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:13,557
Have you booked the restaurant?

112
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:14,934
A table for two at 8:00.

113
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:18,354
Miss Yu called
to say she's on her way.

114
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,776
l'll be back after dinner.
Can l bring you something?

115
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:26,362
No, thanks. l'll get my own.

116
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,325
Leave when you're ready.
l'll lock up.

117
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:37,414
- Good evening, Mr. Ho!
- Evening!

118
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,686
- Going out, Mrs. Chan?
- Yes.

119
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,608
Going out so late?

120
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,152
Just getting some noodles.

121
00:08:06,236 --> 00:08:09,488
Amah is making pork soup. Join us.

122
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:12,658
Thanks, l'm not really hungry.
l just want some air.

123
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,827
You're too polite.

124
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,328
Next time!

125
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:23,085
They're all starving. We can eat.

126
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,839
Have you spoken to Ming?

127
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,258
So l'll go with someone else!

128
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,470
Just kidding!

129
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:37,016
l'll be early tonight. See you soon!

130
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,609
Chow!

131
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:47,776
Coming!

132
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:59,205
Time to go! Finish it tomorrow!

133
00:08:59,289 --> 00:09:01,874
No, l'm nearly there.

134
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,000
Oh, Ming.

135
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,587
- l need a few days off next month.
- Why?

136
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:10,591
l promised my wife a trip.
Put in a word for me, will you?

137
00:09:11,176 --> 00:09:13,886
l'll speak to personnel.

138
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,971
But the next lunch is on you.

139
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,223
l will.

140
00:09:17,307 --> 00:09:18,807
Thanks, Ming!

141
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,229
lt's ready!

142
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,273
No, it'll switch itself off!

143
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,401
l told you, it's not ready!

144
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,821
A rice cooker!
lt's yours, Mrs. Koo?

145
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:38,244
No, it's beyond us!
lt's Mrs. Chan's.

146
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,081
My husband brought it from Japan.

147
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:44,124
l wanted to show Mrs. Koo
how good it is.

148
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,126
Now it's ready!

149
00:09:56,346 --> 00:10:01,016
Mrs. Chan, could Mr. Chan
get me one next time?

150
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,601
No problem!

151
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:05,646
Mr. Chow, you should get one too!

152
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,192
Your wife's so often late home.

153
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:13,112
l couldn't trouble Mr. Chan.

154
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:15,698
lt's just neighborly, isn't it?

155
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,119
lt's no trouble!
l'll ask him to buy another next time.

156
00:10:20,829 --> 00:10:22,204
Thank you!

157
00:10:31,256 --> 00:10:33,882
Let's try the rice.

158
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,804
Mr. Chan, sorry to trouble you
about the rice cooker.

159
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:40,973
lt was really no trouble.

160
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,643
How much do l owe you?

161
00:10:44,728 --> 00:10:46,854
Your wife has already paid me.

162
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:49,565
- Really?
- She didn't tell you?

163
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,942
She's been working late shifts.

164
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:54,153
Often l'm asleep when she gets back.

165
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,031
- lt must be hard for her.
- Yes.

166
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,158
Mrs. Chan isn't back yet?

167
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,494
She'll be back soon.
You need to talk to her?

168
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,122
A friend needs to go to Singapore.

169
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,666
l wonder if she could get
a cheap ticket for him.

170
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:09,376
l'll ask when she gets back.

171
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,880
l'm bothering you too much.

172
00:11:12,964 --> 00:11:16,175
Don't mention it. We're neighbors!

173
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,427
l'll leave you in peace.

174
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,226
Looking for me?

175
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:29,271
Damn right. Where've you been?

176
00:11:29,898 --> 00:11:31,148
What's up?

177
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:35,861
Mrs. Chan called.
You left a hat at her office.

178
00:11:35,945 --> 00:11:39,031
l meant to!
l wanted an excuse to go back.

179
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,866
l know your tricks!

180
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:43,619
She's married.

181
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,746
l know, that's why l left.

182
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,916
Otherwise l'd move in next door.

183
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,920
lf your wife wasn't so attractive,
she'd be a worried woman!

184
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,341
l'm not like you.

185
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,303
Please call Mrs. Chan for me.

186
00:12:01,388 --> 00:12:03,222
l'll pick up the hat tomorrow.

187
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,765
And take her to lunch!

188
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:06,850
Dream on!

189
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,812
She'll take the hat home.
l'll bring it in tomorrow.

190
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,357
You're kidding!
Some buddy you are!

191
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,609
Tell you what,
let's go pick her up now!

192
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:20,072
She should be off work by now.
We can go together!

193
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,157
l don't have time for this.

194
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,325
Chow!

195
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:26,120
Yes! Get out of here, l'm busy.

196
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:30,499
Then l'll wait at your place.

197
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,000
Ping!

198
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,261
Mr. Chow, is Mr. Koo in?

199
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:45,305
He's out.
Forgot to buy the paper again?

200
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,807
That's right, l'll stop by later.

201
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:49,351
- Maybe l can find it for you.
- Thank you.

202
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,072
- This one?
- Yes.

203
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,952
l always loved those serials.
Hated to miss an episode.

204
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,954
Really? You liked them too?

205
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,541
l even thought of writing one!

206
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:14,460
Why didn't you?

207
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,296
l couldn't get started,
so l gave up.

208
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,590
l wasn't born
to write martial arts stories!

209
00:13:19,674 --> 00:13:22,009
But you can borrow
from my collection anytime.

210
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:24,428
Not now. Maybe another time.

211
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,679
- Thanks.
- You're welcome!

212
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,814
What is it? Mrs. Chan!

213
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:38,901
l just want to return these
to Mr. Chow. ls he in?

214
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,986
He's been away for a few days.

215
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,112
Why?

216
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:45,032
They had a quarrel.

217
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:49,453
Leave them with me.
l'll pass them back to him.

218
00:13:50,413 --> 00:13:51,455
Thank you.

219
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,298
Forget it!

220
00:14:02,217 --> 00:14:05,385
l'm on a replacement shift tonight.

221
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:11,433
Talk to you later.

222
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,686
No need to pick me up!

223
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:19,233
She's already left.

224
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,362
Really? l was going
to take her out for supper.

225
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:26,782
Didn't she tell you
she was off early today?

226
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,493
She never remembers to tell me.

227
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:33,330
Maybe she's home by now.

228
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,582
l'll be off, then.

229
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay, bye!

230
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,688
Hello!

231
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,410
You're out of hospital!

232
00:17:16,494 --> 00:17:19,371
Don't mention hospital!
Lend me $30!

233
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,747
What for?

234
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,958
You gotta help me save face!

235
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,209
What's the big deal?

236
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,086
lt's Ah Hoi's fault.

237
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,464
He gave me a racing tip,
said it was a sure thing.

238
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:34,428
Before they'd taken out the stitches...

239
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:36,930
l bet everything l had.

240
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,640
And l lost my shirt!

241
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,767
What did you expect?

242
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:43,895
l thought it was my lucky day.

243
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,814
Anyhow, l had only $2 left.

244
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:49,901
So l went to the whorehouse.

245
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,195
You were in no shape for sex!

246
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,322
l thought it would improve my luck.

247
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:58,785
What would $2 buy you?

248
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:03,498
l'm Kwai-fei's regular.
She gives me credit.

249
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,459
You can have it on credit?

250
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:09,087
l left my lD card and said
l'd be back to redeem it.

251
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:11,840
l thought a few dollars
would be easy to rustle up.

252
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,842
But so far nothing.
l'm way overdue.

253
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,302
So?

254
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,471
Four Eyes was there yesterday.

255
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:19,973
Saw her waving my lD
around in front of everyone.

256
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,266
So embarrassing!

257
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,435
Anyway, lend me $30!

258
00:18:29,901 --> 00:18:31,568
This is all l can spare.

259
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,780
l need $10 for myself.

260
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,242
Pay you back next month.

261
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,496
- Let's have a late snack.
- What?

262
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:45,749
All l've had today
is some won-ton noodles.

263
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,626
Let me finish writing this first.

264
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,964
l'm not sure
l should tell you this-

265
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:54,716
What?

266
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:57,511
l saw your wife
in the street yesterday.

267
00:18:57,595 --> 00:18:59,179
So what?

268
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:03,975
She was with some guy.

269
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,315
Probably a friend.

270
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:15,070
Just thought you should know.

271
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:20,283
Miss Yu? This is me.

272
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:25,330
Mr. Ho's still in a meeting.
He says he can't manage dinner.

273
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,459
Yes, we're very busy now.

274
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,089
l will.

275
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,717
l'll ask Mr. Ho to call.

276
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,099
Have you called Miss Yu?

277
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,517
Yes, l have.

278
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,726
What did she say?

279
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,895
Asks you to call her later.

280
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,606
And Mrs. Ho says she's ready
to cut her birthday cake.

281
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:53,024
She wants you to hurry home.

282
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:55,819
- Did you get me a present for her?
- Yes, this.

283
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:58,113
- What is it?
- A scarf.

284
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,240
l think Mrs. Ho will like it.

285
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,491
Thank you.

286
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:02,742
And here's your change.

287
00:20:02,827 --> 00:20:07,205
l'm always troubling you.
Use it for bus fare.

288
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:09,916
Why don't you dine with us tonight?

289
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:13,169
Thank you, l've already
planned to see a film tonight.

290
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,046
Then l won't keep you.

291
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,383
Tomorrow will be quiet.
Take the morning off.

292
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:30,061
Are you going out tonight?

293
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,274
Don't forget your keys.

294
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:36,651
All the neighbors
are dining out tonight.

295
00:20:37,278 --> 00:20:41,156
l have a lot to do here.
l'll be late.

296
00:20:56,339 --> 00:20:58,381
What is it, Mrs. Chan?

297
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,674
l heard voices,

298
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:02,052
l thought Mr. and Mrs. Koo
were back.

299
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,597
Not yet. Anything l can help with?

300
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:09,684
No, l just wanted a chat.

301
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,854
- Are you alone?
- Yes, l am.

302
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,859
You're back early today!

303
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,529
l came back to rest.
l'm not feeling well...

304
00:21:23,658 --> 00:21:26,618
What is it?
l have some medicines...

305
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,663
Don't trouble yourself,
l'll sleep it off.

306
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:34,167
ln that case...
l'll leave you in peace.

307
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,883
lt was your wife.

308
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,638
Have you spoken to your wife yet?

309
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,641
Then we shouldn't meet anymore.

310
00:22:37,231 --> 00:22:39,190
Any news from the Philippines?

311
00:22:39,275 --> 00:22:40,650
Yes, a telex.

312
00:22:40,735 --> 00:22:42,694
There's a typhoon,
so the ship's still docked.

313
00:22:43,404 --> 00:22:48,616
Please inform Chan
that the shipment may be delayed.

314
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,326
Ask if that's a problem.

315
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,125
Your wife rang.
You don't need to pick her up.

316
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,918
She's playing mahjong with Mrs. Lau.

317
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,546
She'll meet you
at the restaurant at 5.30.

318
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,634
And there's a gift from Miss Yu.

319
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,261
She was here?

320
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,388
No, she had it sent over.

321
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:14,059
She says she'll dine alone
since it's your birthday.

322
00:23:14,143 --> 00:23:16,811
Please phone her
when you have a moment.

323
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:21,566
- l'll get you another coffee.
- Thank you.

324
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,799
Thank you.

325
00:23:51,138 --> 00:23:52,847
That tie looks good on you.

326
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:57,811
You noticed?
lt's much like the old one.

327
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,272
You notice things
if you pay attention.

328
00:24:13,911 --> 00:24:15,286
l'll be off now.

329
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:18,665
lf Chan has a problem,
let me know at the restaurant.

330
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:19,541
l will.

331
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:21,042
Why did you change your tie?

332
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:22,919
The new one was too showy.

333
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,796
l should stick with my own.

334
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,589
Don't forget to lock up.

335
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:16,491
By the way,
haven't seen your husband lately.

336
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,245
He's abroad now,
on company business.

337
00:26:20,329 --> 00:26:22,789
That's why l see you
at the noodle stall.

338
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,125
l don't like cooking for myself.

339
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,587
Haven't seen your wife
lately either.

340
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:34,008
Her mother's ill.
She's at home with her.

341
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:36,928
That explains it.

342
00:26:37,805 --> 00:26:40,515
Good night!

343
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:42,892
Mrs. Chan, l'm glad you're back!

344
00:26:42,977 --> 00:26:44,769
lt's raining so hard!

345
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,813
l was going to look for you
with an umbrella.

346
00:26:46,897 --> 00:26:48,231
You're too kind.

347
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,691
Amah, who is it?

348
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:50,483
lt's Mrs. Chan.

349
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,609
Mrs. Suen!

350
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:56,906
Caught in the rain?
l said you could eat with us!

351
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,575
Next time... Enjoy your game.

352
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,874
Her husband's always away.
lt's sad to see her so lonely.

353
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:11,129
She dresses up like that
to go out for noodles?

354
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,225
Mr. Chow!
What are you doing here?

355
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,936
Just calling Mrs. Koo to the phone.

356
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,981
You're late back.

357
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,816
l went to the pictures.

358
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:34,068
l'll be going.

359
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,660
Hello?

360
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:45,121
Yes, please hold on.

361
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,665
- Who is it?
- lt's for Mrs. Chan.

362
00:27:58,177 --> 00:28:01,971
lt must seem odd to ask you out,
but l want to ask something.

363
00:28:02,473 --> 00:28:04,474
That handbag l saw you with
this evening...

364
00:28:04,558 --> 00:28:06,267
Where did you buy it?

365
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,062
Why do you ask?

366
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:14,359
lt looked so elegant.
l want to get one for my wife.

367
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:19,447
Mr. Chow, you're so good
to your wife!

368
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:23,868
Not really! My wife is so fussy.

369
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,705
Her birthday is some days away.
l don't know what to get her.

370
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,252
Could you buy one
for me to give her?

371
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:38,633
Maybe she wouldn't want one
just exactly the same.

372
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:43,304
You're right, l didn't think of that.

373
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,349
A woman would mind.

374
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:50,061
Yes, especially since
we're neighbors.

375
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,399
Do they come in other colors?

376
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,404
l'd have to ask my husband.

377
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:00,822
Why?

378
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:05,243
He bought it for me
on a business trip abroad.

379
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:07,245
They aren't on sale here.

380
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,583
Then never mind.

381
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,466
Actually...

382
00:29:20,551 --> 00:29:22,718
l want to ask you something too.

383
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:25,805
What?

384
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,850
Where did you buy your tie?

385
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,688
l don't know where it came from.

386
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:36,149
My wife buys all my ties.

387
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,900
Really?

388
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:45,700
She bought this one
on a business trip abroad.

389
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,869
lt's not on sale here.

390
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,955
What a coincidence!

391
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:55,042
Yes.

392
00:30:00,716 --> 00:30:02,175
Actually...

393
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,305
my husband has one just like it.

394
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:11,017
He said it was a gift from his boss.

395
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:12,977
So he wears it every day.

396
00:30:18,025 --> 00:30:20,568
And my wife has a bag
just like yours.

397
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:23,029
l know,

398
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:24,322
l've seen it.

399
00:30:26,909 --> 00:30:29,076
What are you getting at, actually?

400
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,716
l thought l was the only one
who knew.

401
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:04,445
l wonder how it began.

402
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:24,257
lt's late.
Won't your wife complain?

403
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,386
She's used to it. She doesn't care.

404
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:32,223
And your husband?

405
00:31:32,766 --> 00:31:35,101
He must be asleep by now.

406
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,147
Shall we stay out tonight?

407
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:49,782
My husband would never say that.

408
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:54,412
What would he say?

409
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:57,290
Anyhow, he wouldn't say that.

410
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,001
Someone must have made
the first move.

411
00:32:00,502 --> 00:32:02,295
Who else could it be?

412
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:10,886
lt's late.
Won't your wife complain?

413
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:14,056
She's used to it. She doesn't care.

414
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,101
And your husband?

415
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,021
He must be asleep by now.

416
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,252
l can't say it.

417
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,300
l understand.

418
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,638
After all, it's already happened.

419
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,098
lt doesn't matter
who made the first move.

420
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,772
Do you really know your wife?

421
00:33:32,803 --> 00:33:35,596
- You order for me.
- Why?

422
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,103
l've no idea what your wife likes.

423
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:54,615
What about your husband?

424
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:37,408
Like it hot?

425
00:34:41,288 --> 00:34:43,205
Your wife likes hot dishes.

426
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,153
Why did you call me
at the office today?

427
00:35:18,867 --> 00:35:20,534
l had nothing to do.
l wanted to hear your voice.

428
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,001
You have my husband down pat.

429
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,128
He's a real sweet-talker.

430
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:59,323
Why didn't you call me today?

431
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,493
l was afraid you won't like it.

432
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,372
Then don't call me again.

433
00:36:22,264 --> 00:36:25,641
Mrs. Chan!
A letter from your husband.

434
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,145
lt's not for me,
it's for Mr. Chow next door.

435
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,567
The Japanese stamp made me think
it was your husband.

436
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,944
So l was wrong.

437
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:55,296
Your wife's in Japan?

438
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,799
How did you know?

439
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,845
What did she say in her letter?

440
00:37:03,513 --> 00:37:04,889
Nothing special.

441
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,684
Anything about
when she'd be back?

442
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:11,604
No.

443
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:15,232
What do you think
they're doing right now?

444
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:53,687
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.

445
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,690
Please pull up here!

446
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,359
Why?

447
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,611
l'll get off first.

448
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,030
No, let me.

449
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,470
- Mrs. Chan!
- Ah Ping! You're back?

450
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:10,389
Visiting Mr. Chow?

451
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,183
Yes, l thought we'd have lunch.
But he isn't well.

452
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:14,518
What's wrong with him?

453
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:17,021
He's got a fever. He's all alone.

454
00:39:17,105 --> 00:39:19,773
So l'm gonna buy him
something to eat.

455
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,900
The congee downstairs
is quite good.

456
00:39:21,985 --> 00:39:23,944
He doesn't want congee.

457
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,404
What does he want?

458
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,032
Can't taste anything,
so he wants sesame syrup.

459
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,616
Damned troublesome!

460
00:39:35,457 --> 00:39:37,708
Amah!

461
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,377
Mrs. Suen, she's hanging
the washing on the roof.

462
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,795
Oh, you're back.

463
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,338
Yes... You've been out?

464
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:46,967
My mother's birthday is coming up.

465
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,136
So l took her to buy some fabric.

466
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,638
lt took all day. l'm half dead!

467
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,932
And l had my hair done.
ls it nice?

468
00:39:54,017 --> 00:39:55,350
Very nice!

469
00:39:55,435 --> 00:39:57,019
What are you cooking?

470
00:39:57,687 --> 00:40:00,522
l had a sudden craving
for sesame syrup.

471
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,609
That whole pot is for you?

472
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,528
l thought l might as well
make a potful.

473
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,114
You're so thoughtful!

474
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,742
- Please try it.
- l will.

475
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:14,244
What a coincidence!

476
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:15,996
Going out?

477
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:19,416
l'll buy some noodles. l'm starving.

478
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:21,001
Hungry? Will you join me?

479
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:23,504
No, thanks.

480
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,756
Just off work?

481
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,591
You must be very busy.

482
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:31,178
Actually, l've been to see a picture.

483
00:40:31,888 --> 00:40:35,015
- Really? How was it?
- So-so.

484
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:37,851
l used to like
going to the pictures.

485
00:40:37,936 --> 00:40:39,937
You had many hobbies before.

486
00:40:40,021 --> 00:40:43,482
On your own,
you are free to do lots of things.

487
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:46,151
Everything changes
when you marry.

488
00:40:46,236 --> 00:40:48,278
lt must be decided together.

489
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:49,530
Right?

490
00:40:52,367 --> 00:40:55,494
l sometimes wonder
what l'd be if l hadn't married.

491
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:57,704
Have you ever thought of that?

492
00:41:00,375 --> 00:41:01,625
Maybe happier!

493
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:08,590
l didn't know married life
would be so complicated!

494
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,635
When you're single,

495
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,720
you are only responsible
to yourself.

496
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,557
Once you're married,

497
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:19,893
doing well on your own
is not enough.

498
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:26,108
Don't brood on it.
Maybe he'll be back soon.

499
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:30,863
What about you?

500
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,365
Actually, we're in the same boat.

501
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,579
But l don't brood on it.

502
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:41,290
lt's not my fault.

503
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:45,002
l can't waste time
wondering if l made mistakes.

504
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:46,920
Life's too short for that.

505
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:49,923
Something must change.

506
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,135
So what's your plan?

507
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,265
l want to write a martial-arts serial.

508
00:41:59,267 --> 00:42:02,060
Actually, l've started one.
l'll show it to you.

509
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:03,770
Great!

510
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,858
You like them too,
so why not help me write it?

511
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,528
l wouldn't know how,
l only read them!

512
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:13,488
We could discuss it together.

513
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:16,950
All right, l'll try my best.

514
00:42:18,745 --> 00:42:20,829
l never thanked you
for the sesame syrup.

515
00:42:20,914 --> 00:42:24,249
There's no need,
l was making it anyway.

516
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,171
Amazing! l was craving
some sesame syrup that day.

517
00:42:29,923 --> 00:42:32,090
Really? What a coincidence!

518
00:42:32,175 --> 00:42:33,800
lt really was!

519
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,012
l'll go for those noodles.

520
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:07,079
Again! Halfway through dinner,
he's drunk! Disgusting!

521
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:10,791
l told you to stop!
What can you do?

522
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,050
lt's me!

523
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:21,718
You scared me.

524
00:45:21,803 --> 00:45:23,678
How's Mr. Koo?

525
00:45:23,763 --> 00:45:25,472
Drunk, as usual.

526
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,441
l didn't expect them back so early!

527
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,988
Since you're trapped here,
finish the noodles.

528
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:47,369
They'll probably go soon.

529
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:04,845
Want some soup?

530
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,817
Mrs. Suen! Playing here tonight!

531
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,362
Yes, Mrs. Koo is dealing
with her husband.

532
00:46:23,072 --> 00:46:25,449
l could do that.

533
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,826
No, we should not trouble you.

534
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:31,413
Think you'll play all night?

535
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:34,207
No, we'll just play eight rounds.

536
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,964
They'll play till morning?

537
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:43,425
Mrs. Suen says only eight rounds.

538
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:45,719
You believe that?

539
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:55,270
You get some rest.
l'll wake you when they leave.

540
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,439
And you?

541
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,399
l have a chapter to finish.

542
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:15,040
Where have you got to?

543
00:47:15,124 --> 00:47:17,000
The drunken master just showed up.

544
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:19,085
When did he get written in?

545
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,630
Just now!

546
00:47:43,861 --> 00:47:46,988
Mr. Chow, home so early?

547
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:49,950
- l went out to buy some food.
- No work today?

548
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,743
l don't feel so good,
l'm staying home.

549
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,371
A sick man shouldn't eat
all that sticky rice.

550
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:56,039
Some of it's for later.

551
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,999
Don't stuff yourself!

552
00:47:58,543 --> 00:47:59,543
Good morning!

553
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,211
Good morning.
Finished your game?

554
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:05,090
Not yet, but Mr. Yang has to work.

555
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:06,883
Mr. Tsai is coming to replace him.

556
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,637
Did you call the office for me?

557
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:12,013
Yes.

558
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,974
What did you tell them?

559
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,850
That you weren't feeling well.

560
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,895
Did they ask who you were?

561
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,230
No.

562
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,360
Probably took me for your husband.

563
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,780
Mr. Ho knows that he's away.

564
00:48:29,365 --> 00:48:31,157
Pretend he's come back.

565
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:42,252
Maybe we're being too cautious.

566
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,170
l'm always round anyway.

567
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,172
We shouldn't have panicked.

568
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:51,219
Well, they did turn up
without warning.

569
00:48:51,304 --> 00:48:53,138
What would they assume?

570
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,393
One can't put a foot wrong.

571
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,392
You can go!

572
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:06,336
- Amah!
- Mrs. Chan! You're back very late!

573
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:09,214
l had a lot of work today.

574
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:12,008
l didn't see you leave this morning.

575
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:14,094
l had breakfast with my mother.

576
00:50:14,178 --> 00:50:15,970
You weren't here when l left.

577
00:50:17,348 --> 00:50:18,348
Where's Mrs. Suen?

578
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:22,560
Asleep.
She played mahjong all day.

579
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,854
- Be quiet, don't wake her.
- All right!

580
00:50:24,939 --> 00:50:27,315
Mrs. Chan, is your leg all right?

581
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,442
lt's these new shoes.

582
00:51:15,656 --> 00:51:17,741
Why a special dinner tonight?

583
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:22,454
Since you won't take
your share of the writing fee...

584
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:26,416
All l did was give you some thoughts.

585
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:30,211
Someone else
is asking for a serial too.

586
00:51:30,296 --> 00:51:32,130
There'll be more work soon.

587
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:36,301
Really? So quickly?
lsn't the workload too much?

588
00:51:36,385 --> 00:51:38,470
That's why
l'm looking for a new place.

589
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:40,680
What for?

590
00:51:41,849 --> 00:51:43,349
To write in!

591
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:46,478
lt'll be more convenient.

592
00:51:47,146 --> 00:51:50,982
There's nothing between us,
but l don't want gossip.

593
00:51:52,902 --> 00:51:54,486
What do you think?

594
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:57,614
Why waste money?

595
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:02,786
You don't need me.
You can write on your own.

596
00:52:41,909 --> 00:52:44,244
Who do you want?

597
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,870
Chow Mo-Wan?

598
00:52:46,455 --> 00:52:48,581
He hasn't been in for several days.

599
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,461
We're looking for him too.

600
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,715
May l know who's calling?

601
00:53:00,302 --> 00:53:01,970
Any message?

602
00:53:03,931 --> 00:53:06,057
lt's no trouble. Good-bye.

603
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,780
Please get this to Accounts.

604
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:23,449
And have the air-conditioner
serviced tomorrow.

605
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:24,951
Mr. Ho!

606
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:28,413
No need to stay
if everything's done.

607
00:53:28,497 --> 00:53:30,498
- l'll lock up.
- Yes.

608
00:53:42,303 --> 00:53:43,553
Hello?

609
00:53:48,893 --> 00:53:50,435
Where are you?

610
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:55,917
l'll come again tomorrow.

611
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:59,045
No need.
l'll be all right after some rest.

612
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:01,881
lt's no trouble.

613
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:05,635
l'll bring you some food.
What would you like?

614
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,928
Whatever.

615
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:10,640
Then l'll leave now. Get some rest.

616
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,475
Call me when you get home.

617
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,895
Let it ring three times,
then hang up.

618
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:17,689
All right.

619
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:26,698
l didn't think you'd come.

620
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,787
We won't be like them.

621
00:55:34,498 --> 00:55:35,581
See you tomorrow.

622
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,886
Tell me honestly...

623
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,266
do you have a mistress?

624
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:02,562
You're crazy!

625
00:58:05,399 --> 00:58:07,150
Who told you l had?

626
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:08,943
Never mind who.

627
00:58:09,862 --> 00:58:11,571
Do you or don't you?

628
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,324
No.

629
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,540
Don't lie!

630
00:58:23,876 --> 00:58:25,585
Look at me.

631
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:28,796
Look at me!

632
00:58:30,591 --> 00:58:32,967
l'm asking you,
do you have a mistress?

633
00:58:37,598 --> 00:58:38,973
Yes!

634
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,731
That's no reaction!

635
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:52,111
lf he admits it outright,
let him have it!

636
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:57,992
l wasn't expecting
he would admit it so easily.

637
00:58:59,870 --> 00:59:01,704
l didn't know how to react!

638
00:59:03,874 --> 00:59:05,374
One more time, all right?

639
00:59:22,935 --> 00:59:24,894
Tell me frankly.

640
00:59:26,146 --> 00:59:28,147
Do you have a mistress?

641
00:59:31,693 --> 00:59:33,194
You're crazy!

642
00:59:38,659 --> 00:59:40,368
Who told you that?

643
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:45,414
Never mind that.
Do you or don't you?

644
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:51,671
No.

645
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,967
Don't lie!

646
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:58,177
Tell me!

647
00:59:59,346 --> 01:00:01,097
Look at me.

648
01:00:01,181 --> 01:00:03,140
Do you have a mistress?

649
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,651
Yes!

650
01:00:40,012 --> 01:00:41,679
Are you all right?

651
01:00:45,100 --> 01:00:47,643
l didn't expect it to hurt so much.

652
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,739
This is just a rehearsal.

653
01:01:02,826 --> 01:01:04,994
He won't really admit it so readily.

654
01:01:05,579 --> 01:01:09,332
lt's all right. Don't take it so hard.

655
01:01:13,712 --> 01:01:16,005
You've been out a lot lately.

656
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,423
Yes.

657
01:01:19,551 --> 01:01:23,554
lt's right to enjoy yourself
while you're young.

658
01:01:24,264 --> 01:01:26,182
But don't overdo it.

659
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,020
When will your husband be back?

660
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,189
Soon!

661
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:39,028
ln future,
don't let him travel so much.

662
01:01:39,613 --> 01:01:43,032
A couple should spend time together.

663
01:01:43,784 --> 01:01:45,451
Don't you agree?

664
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,163
Good night.

665
01:02:10,477 --> 01:02:12,395
Will you come over tonight?

666
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:14,230
What for?

667
01:02:14,314 --> 01:02:17,149
The editor's hounding me.
He says I'm too sIow.

668
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,735
I need your heIp.
When can you come?

669
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,030
Not anytime soon.

670
01:02:23,532 --> 01:02:24,865
Why not?

671
01:02:25,492 --> 01:02:28,244
Mrs. Suen lectured me last night.

672
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:30,329
What did she say?

673
01:02:30,414 --> 01:02:31,956
Rather not say.

674
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,126
We shouldn't see so much
of each other.

675
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:48,931
Mrs. Chan,
going out for noodles again?

676
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:52,852
Not tonight.
l'll make myself something.

677
01:02:53,812 --> 01:02:59,775
Join us.
We're having vegetable won-tons!

678
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,694
All right.

679
01:05:33,138 --> 01:05:35,389
- No lunch today, Mr. Ho?
- No.

680
01:05:36,683 --> 01:05:39,268
A Mr. Chow just called for you.

681
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:41,186
He wants you to call him back.

682
01:05:44,316 --> 01:05:45,649
Thank you.

683
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:20,517
- Back from work?
- Yes.

684
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,313
Strange weather!

685
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:25,773
lsn't it?

686
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,399
Been here long?

687
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,068
Just a while.

688
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,030
l don't think it'll stop soon.

689
01:06:35,367 --> 01:06:36,533
Wait for me.

690
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,605
l'll see you home.

691
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:11,235
We'd better not be seen together.

692
01:07:12,487 --> 01:07:14,196
Then you go first.

693
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,200
lf they see your umbrella...

694
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,911
they'll know l was with you.

695
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:24,707
l wasn't thinking.

696
01:07:28,378 --> 01:07:32,005
You go first, l'll wait a while.

697
01:07:33,299 --> 01:07:34,967
l'll keep you company.

698
01:07:57,157 --> 01:07:58,782
Did you try to call me?

699
01:08:01,161 --> 01:08:03,245
l wasn't sure you got the message.

700
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,206
Could you get me a boat ticket?

701
01:08:08,585 --> 01:08:10,294
To where?

702
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,630
Ah Ping wrote from Singapore.

703
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:17,968
They're short of staff.
He'd like me to go and help.

704
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,807
How long will you stay?

705
01:08:23,892 --> 01:08:26,935
Don't know. l'll play it by ear.

706
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,859
Why rush off to Singapore?

707
01:08:35,445 --> 01:08:37,154
A change of scene.

708
01:08:39,157 --> 01:08:40,991
l've had enough of the gossip.

709
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:45,329
We know it's not true,
so why worry?

710
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:53,545
l used to think that too,
and it didn't worry me.

711
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:59,009
l thought we wouldn't be like them.

712
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,932
But l was wrong.

713
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:09,895
You won't leave your husband.

714
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,191
So l'd rather go away.

715
01:09:21,241 --> 01:09:23,492
l didn't think
you'd fall in love with me.

716
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,578
l didn't either.

717
01:09:31,835 --> 01:09:34,294
l was only curious
to know how it started.

718
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:37,005
Now l know.

719
01:09:38,758 --> 01:09:40,843
Feelings can creep up just like that.

720
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,349
l thought l was in control.

721
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:50,269
But l hate to think
of your husband coming home.

722
01:09:51,354 --> 01:09:53,063
l wish he'd stay away!

723
01:09:54,858 --> 01:09:56,483
l'm so bad!

724
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,947
Will you do me one favor?

725
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:04,575
What?

726
01:10:05,952 --> 01:10:08,078
l want to be prepared.

727
01:11:04,344 --> 01:11:06,428
You'd better not see me again.

728
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,101
ls your husband back?

729
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:15,354
Yes.

730
01:11:17,357 --> 01:11:19,024
Am l hopeless?

731
01:11:21,486 --> 01:11:22,903
Not really.

732
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,082
l won't see you again.

733
01:11:37,543 --> 01:11:39,461
Keep a closer eye on your husband.

734
01:12:20,003 --> 01:12:21,420
Please.

735
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,090
Don't be serious,
it's only a rehearsal.

736
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,093
Don't cry!

737
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:34,099
This isn't real.

738
01:13:24,317 --> 01:13:26,234
l don't want to go home tonight.

739
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:57,766
Mei-Yi wants to dedicate a song
to her honeymooning friends.

740
01:13:57,850 --> 01:14:02,437
And Mrs. Cheung wishes the best
to her neighbors.

741
01:14:03,272 --> 01:14:05,857
And Mr. Chan,
now on business in Japan,

742
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:11,905
wants to wish his wife
a happy birthday.

743
01:14:11,989 --> 01:14:17,202
So let's all enjoy Zhou Xuan
singing in "Full Bloom."

744
01:15:57,803 --> 01:15:58,970
lt's me.

745
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,515
lf there's an extra ticket...

746
01:16:03,559 --> 01:16:05,227
would you go with me?

747
01:18:33,667 --> 01:18:35,126
It's me.

748
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:38,129
If there's an extra ticket...

749
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,507
would you go with me?

750
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:54,646
SlNGAPORE, 1963

751
01:18:57,149 --> 01:18:59,692
Mr. Chow has gone to work.

752
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:01,903
Any message?

753
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:04,948
You're welcome!

754
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,604
Has anyone been in my room?

755
01:19:36,689 --> 01:19:37,689
No.

756
01:19:38,190 --> 01:19:39,649
Something's missing.

757
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:40,859
What?

758
01:20:11,223 --> 01:20:12,390
ln the old days...

759
01:20:13,851 --> 01:20:19,189
if someone had a secret
they didn't want to share...

760
01:20:19,732 --> 01:20:21,524
you know what they did?

761
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:24,235
Have no idea.

762
01:20:27,615 --> 01:20:29,782
They went up a mountain,
found a tree...

763
01:20:31,619 --> 01:20:33,411
carved a hole in it...

764
01:20:34,121 --> 01:20:36,206
and whispered the secret
into the hole.

765
01:20:37,291 --> 01:20:39,542
Then they covered it with mud.

766
01:20:41,212 --> 01:20:45,423
And leave the secret there forever.

767
01:20:47,593 --> 01:20:51,763
What a pain!
l'd just go to get laid.

768
01:20:54,975 --> 01:20:56,684
Not everyone's like you!

769
01:20:57,978 --> 01:21:02,315
l'm just an average guy.
l don't have secrets like you.

770
01:21:02,399 --> 01:21:05,360
You bottle things up!

771
01:21:05,444 --> 01:21:07,362
Tell me something!

772
01:21:07,905 --> 01:21:09,614
l don't have secrets.

773
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,618
Come off it, buddy!

774
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,120
l won't tell anyone.

775
01:23:44,144 --> 01:23:45,853
Hello, Singapore Daily.

776
01:23:46,480 --> 01:23:47,855
Hold on.

777
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:50,942
Mr. Chow, call for you.

778
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,276
Thanks!

779
01:23:55,155 --> 01:24:03,371
Hello?

780
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:51,085
HONG KONG, 1966

781
01:24:52,087 --> 01:24:54,881
- Who is it?
- lt's me.

782
01:24:55,883 --> 01:24:58,801
- Mrs. Chan, long time no see!
- Yes.

783
01:24:59,344 --> 01:25:00,887
- Amah, who's there?
- Mrs. Suen!

784
01:25:00,971 --> 01:25:03,139
What brings you here?

785
01:25:03,223 --> 01:25:05,516
lt's been a while.

786
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:09,020
l was nearby so l thought
l'd bring your boat ticket.

787
01:25:09,688 --> 01:25:11,105
And a small gift.

788
01:25:11,190 --> 01:25:13,983
You shouldn't have.
lt's nice just to see you.

789
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:16,194
The place is in such a mess!

790
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,570
Already started packing?

791
01:25:17,654 --> 01:25:24,160
lt's hopeless.
l can't bear to throw things away!

792
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:27,538
Let's find you a seat.

793
01:25:31,585 --> 01:25:33,461
- Have some tea!
- Thank you!

794
01:25:34,046 --> 01:25:38,341
Eat with us, Mrs. Chan!
l'm going to the market.

795
01:25:40,010 --> 01:25:43,137
l can't. l have work waiting.

796
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,765
Don't rush off!

797
01:25:46,308 --> 01:25:51,270
Mrs. Suen will be upset
if you don't eat here.

798
01:25:51,355 --> 01:25:53,523
Amah, pour me some tea too.

799
01:25:55,067 --> 01:25:56,651
How's your husband?

800
01:25:56,735 --> 01:25:58,569
He's fine, thank you.

801
01:25:58,654 --> 01:26:00,404
How long will you be away?

802
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,365
l don't know.

803
01:26:02,449 --> 01:26:05,326
lf l like it, l might stay!

804
01:26:05,828 --> 01:26:07,078
Why?

805
01:26:07,162 --> 01:26:13,125
My daughter worries
about the situation in Hong Kong.

806
01:26:13,210 --> 01:26:16,045
l don't want to leave.

807
01:26:16,129 --> 01:26:22,093
Since the Koos left, l don't have
my mahjong partners anymore.

808
01:26:22,761 --> 01:26:28,599
And my daughter needs help
with her kids in the US.

809
01:26:31,645 --> 01:26:33,354
What about this place?

810
01:26:34,189 --> 01:26:36,524
l'm not sure...

811
01:26:37,943 --> 01:26:39,944
l don't want to sell it.

812
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:43,781
So l might rent it out.

813
01:26:44,825 --> 01:26:46,617
How much would you want?

814
01:26:48,161 --> 01:26:49,912
You're interested?

815
01:26:49,997 --> 01:26:54,709
You could have it at a discount.

816
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,377
l'll think about it.

817
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:57,962
Mrs. Suen, your tea!

818
01:26:59,464 --> 01:27:02,049
Who lives next door now?

819
01:27:02,134 --> 01:27:08,764
l don't really know them.

820
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:15,271
The Koos were almost like family!

821
01:27:16,565 --> 01:27:19,859
lt was so nice then, wasn't it?

822
01:27:20,360 --> 01:27:21,652
Yes.

823
01:27:22,321 --> 01:27:24,322
Let's sit over here.

824
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,099
Yes?

825
01:27:52,184 --> 01:27:53,768
ls Mr. Koo in?

826
01:27:53,852 --> 01:27:56,687
He moved long ago.

827
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,648
Do you know where he is?

828
01:27:59,733 --> 01:28:01,317
You know him well?

829
01:28:01,860 --> 01:28:03,527
l used to live here.

830
01:28:04,821 --> 01:28:06,530
ls Mrs. Suen still next door?

831
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:12,161
She's gone! lt's too chaotic.
Everyone's running away.

832
01:28:12,871 --> 01:28:14,830
So who lives there now?

833
01:28:14,915 --> 01:28:19,126
A woman and her son.

834
01:28:19,795 --> 01:28:21,462
The kid is cute.

835
01:28:24,591 --> 01:28:29,178
No address in the Philippines.
Just his son's phone number.

836
01:28:30,764 --> 01:28:35,434
- l can't accept this!
- Please, you must.

837
01:28:35,519 --> 01:28:38,229
Thank you, then.

838
01:28:49,658 --> 01:28:51,325
That era has passed.

839
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:54,412
Nothing that belonged to it
exists any more.

840
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:56,831
Are you ready?

841
01:28:56,915 --> 01:28:59,041
- Okay!
- Let's go!

842
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:14,724
CAMBODlA, 1966

843
01:29:14,808 --> 01:29:19,770
The presidential corps waits
at Pochentong Airport...

844
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:24,900
Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and Queen Sisowath Kossamak...

845
01:29:24,985 --> 01:29:26,861
come forward
to greet General De Gaulle.

846
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:38,914
It's ten kiIometers
from Pochentong to Phnom Penh.

847
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:42,710
200,000 people line the route.

848
01:29:42,794 --> 01:29:45,087
A welcome unprecedented
in the history of the kingdom.

849
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:24,014
He remembers those vanished years.

850
01:33:24,099 --> 01:33:28,686
As though looking through
a dusty window pane,

851
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:33,774
the past is something he could see,
but not touch.

852
01:33:33,858 --> 01:33:38,862
And everything he sees
is blurred and indistinct.

853
01:33:41,449 --> 01:33:47,121
The End

854
01:33:48,873 --> 01:33:51,166
