Hey, Mom, hey, Dad, it's Dani.

25
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,290
抱歉这么晚打给你们
I'm sorry to be calling so late.

26
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,600
我就是问问家里情况
I'm just checking in.

27
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:06,700
看看是不是一切都好
Making sure everything's okay.

泰莉给我发了封很吓人的邮件
Listen, I got kind of a scary email from Terri

29
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,550
之后她就不回复我了
and she hasn't been responding.

30
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:15,120
老一套了
Surprise, surprise.

31
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,630
但是  听起来好像
But, yeah, it sounds like you guys

32
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:21,500
你们吵架了还是出什么事了
have been fighting or something happened.

33
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,710
总之  我就是有点担心
Anyway, uh, I just got a little worried.

34
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:26,770
有空的时候给我回个电话吧
So, if you can call when you can,

35
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:28,990
当然了  你们知道我一直都在
and of course, you know I'm... I'm always here

36
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,180
有需要就告诉我
if you need anything,

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,660
我随时都在

00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,230
你在干什么
What are you up to?

57
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:56,470
和马克抽了点大麻脂

58
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:57,740
现在我们订了披萨

00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,950
不错
Nice.

60
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,520
丹妮  丹妮
Hi, Dani. Hi, Dani.

61
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,500
他在跟你打招呼  一遍一遍不停地说
He's saying "hi" right now, over and over.

62
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,010
-你好  马克  -你好  马克
- Hi, Mark. - Hi, Mark.

63
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,990
我打电话是想问问
So, I was calling just to see if you...

64
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,610
你一会还想不想一起玩
You still wanted to hang out later?

65
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,340
我们有说过今晚有安排吗
Did we talk about doing something tonight?

66
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,770
没有...没具体定下来
I mean, not... Not concretely,

67
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:26,010
但是  我就是想问问
but, I just wanted to see...

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,050
那...好啊
Well... Okay.

69
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,230
好  我应该能过去
Yeah, I should be able to swing by.

70
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,560
-好  -那好
- Cool. - Yeah, okay.

71
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,240
你妹妹的事怎么样了
How's the sister situation?

72
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,870
这个
Well...yeah

73
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:53,810
我给她发了三封邮件
I emailed her three times and

74
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,170
还是没有回复
still no response

75
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:58,040
所以我现在有点担心
so I'm getting a little bit nervous, so...

76
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,630
肯定没事的
I'm sure it's fine.

77
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,680
嗯  大概没事
Yeah, probably...

78
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,330
这对她来说是家常便饭了  丹妮
She does this every other day, Dani.

79
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,180
就是因为你总是纵容她
And only because you let her.

80
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:08,410
我不是纵容她  她有双相障碍  所以...
Well, I don't let her, she's bipolar, so...

81
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,330
我知道  但是你的确挺纵容她的  宝贝
Yeah, I know. But, you do though, babes.

82
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,590
你直接跳到危机模式
You go straight to crisis mode.

83
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,740
这  她是我妹妹
Well, she's my sister

84
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,530
你也说了这封邮件看起来不太寻常
and even you said that this email seemed different.

85
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,880
对  但是
Yeah, right, but...

86
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,460
真的不寻常吗
Is it though, really?

87
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,160
很明显又是吸引注意力的小伎俩
It's still just another obvious ploy for attention

88
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,620
和之前害你惊恐发作的伎俩如出一辙
just like every other panic attack she's given you.

89
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,220
对  你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

90
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,960
你说得对  我知道
You are right, yeah, I know.

91
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,800
你做出的回应越多
I mean, the more you respond

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:37,770
她就会越受到鼓励
the more she's encouraged to keep...

93
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,290
我知道我知道  你说得对  你说得对
No, I know, I know, I know. You're right, you're right.

94
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:42,850
我就是  我就是不长记性  谢谢你
I just... I just needed to be reminded, thank you.

95
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,790
有你我真幸运
I'm very lucky to have you.

96
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,130
这个嘛
Yeah, well.

97
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,820
我爱你
I love you.

98
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,930
我爱你
I love you.

99
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:00,160
好了  晚点见
Okay, I'll see you later?

100
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,390
-行  -好
- Yeah. - Okay.

101
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,100
-再见  马克  -再见  马克
- Bye, Mark. - Bye, Mark.

102
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:07,570
行了  我爱你
Okay, I love you.

103
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,810
-好  -再见
- All right. - Bye.

104
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:14,400
他的语气  听他说话的声音就能听出来
It's in his tone, like, you can hear it in his voice,

105
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,420
他是鼓起勇气有话要说
he's just working up the nerve to say something.

106
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,190
那就直接点  跟他挑明
So be direct! Confront him.

107
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,220
但万一是我吓到他了呢
What if I've scared him, though?

108
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,200
我总是把他卷进我们家这点破事里
I'm always roping him into my family crap.

109
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,340
什么叫把他卷进去了
How do you rope him in?

110
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,650
我一直都在依赖他
I'm always leaning on him!

111
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,230
我今天甚至哭着打给他
Like, I even called him today in tears

112
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:27,780
因为我妹妹又写了一封吓人的邮件
because my sister wrote another stupid scary email.

113
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,130
这就是男友的用处啊
That's what he's there for.

114
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,240
万一我把他吓跑了怎么办
What if I'm scaring him off?

115
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,670
你妹妹写什么了
What did your sister write?

116
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,180
就是一些不吉利的废话
Just some ominous bullshit

00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,140
和之前一个德行  太折磨人了
like she always does and it's torture.

119
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,060
我一直依赖他来支持我
And I lean on him constantly for support.

120
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,600
万一我给他的压力太大了怎么办
Like, what if I have overwhelmed him

121
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,840
让他认为我包袱太多了
and he thinks that I just have too much baggage?

122
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,460
如果真是这样的话  那正好摆脱他  对吧
Well, if that's the case, then good riddance, right?

123
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,660
不  不能因为...我太过分了
No, not if I... I went too far,

124
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,230
我对他太依赖了
if I leaned too much.

125
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,690
你没有  你需要他的时候他就该支持你
You didn't! He should be there when you need him.

126
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:56,350
但是如果我总是需要他
Yeah, but what if I need him too often

127
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,680
这就变成负担了呢
and it becomes a chore?

128
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,150
那说明他不是对的人
Then he's not the right guy.

129
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,190
{\an8}我担心死了  求你回邮件

130
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:01,730
因为这永远都不该是负担
Because it shouldn't ever be a chore.

131
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:03,500
如果他依赖你  你会觉得是负担吗
Would it be a chore if he leaned on you?

132
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,920
但是他对我一点索求都没有
Yeah, but he doesn't ask me for anything.

133
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,040
我都没见他哭过
I've never even seen him cry,

或是说只有你敞开心扉了

00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,220
要是我之后又后悔了
What if I regret it later

147
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,670
却没办法挽回她了呢
and I can't get her back?

148
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,630
-你肯定不会想挽回她  -没准呢
- You don't want her back! - But I might.

149
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,320
好吧  那你可以
Okay, well, then you can

150
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,850
尽情跟我们抱怨你有多后悔
bitch to us about how much you regret it for that day

151
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,430
然后我们再一次提醒你
and then we'll remind you again

152
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,220
你一直都想摆脱这段糟心的关系
that you've been wanting out of this stupid relationship

153
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,800
大概有  一年了
for, like, a year now

154
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,140
然后你就可以找个真的喜欢做爱的小妞
and then you can find a chick who actually likes sex

155
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,260
还不会每天都给你找一堆麻烦
and doesn't drag you through a million hoops every day.

156
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:42,720
你觉得你内心有没有受虐倾向
Do you think there is a masochistic part of you

157
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,570
你上演这出闹剧是为了
that is playing out this particular drama

158
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,960
回避你真正需要完成的工作
to avoid the work you actually need to be doing?

159
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,550
我有什么工作需要完成  乔希
What work do I need to be doing, Josh, exactly?

160
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,460
我也说不好  没准该写开题报告了
Well, I dunno, your prospectus, maybe?

161
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,840
你的博士论文
Your PhD...

162
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,090
行  谢谢你给我做心理分析
Okay, thanks for the psychoanalysis.

163
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:58,320
跟学术无关  乔希
It's not about academics, Josh.

164
00:07:58,320 --> 00:07:59,130
我就是想让你专注点
I'm just trying to get you focused.

165
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:01,790
-要找零吗  -给你的小费
- Change? - That's for you.

166
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,970
看见没  你现在就能去把那姑娘的肚子搞大
See? You could be getting that girl pregnant right now.

167
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:09,680
而且别忘了那些瑞典女人
And don't forget about all the Swedish women

168
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,680
你可以在六月让她们怀孕
you can impregnate in June.

169
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,200
-行了  -别忘了
- Okay, guys. - Don't forget about

170
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,550
那些瑞典挤奶女工
all the Swedish milkmaids.

171
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,170
{\an8}丹妮

172
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,430
不会又是她吧
That's not her again.

173
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:19,640
不是吧
Seriously?

174
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,300
我的天
Oh, my God.

175
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:24,760
-她需要看心理医生了  -她有心理医生
- She needs a therapist, dude. - She has a therapist.

176
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,860
那她就应该打给心理医生而不是你
So then she should call her therapist and not you.

177
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,230
这简直就是虐待
It's literally abuse.

178
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,710
-她在虐待你  -借过
- She's abusing you. - 'Scuse me.

179
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,860
-不行  -天呐
- Nope. - My God.

180
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,120
行了  让我过去
Okay, excuse me, guys.

181

反正也睡不着
I wasn't sleeping anyway.

198
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:46,010
我真他妈的害怕过夏天
Yeah, I'm fucking dreading the summer.

199
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:47,300
闷在那个狗窝里
Stuck in a shit-ass hole

200
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:50,090
每天听着我爸干我后妈
listening to my step-mom fuck my dad all day.

201
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,840
我愿意听你爸干你后妈
I'll listen to your step-mom fuck your dad.

我们商量过这事
I mean, we were talking about it.

215
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,840
我们考虑了一下
We were thinking about it.

216
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:32,420
什么时候去
For when?

217
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:36,750
六月中旬到七月中旬
Mid-June to mid-July.

218

对  两周之后

219
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,460
对
Yeah.

220
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:42,020
前提是我们真的要去
I mean, that's if we even go.

221
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:45,130
我可能不去  不过
I'm probably not gonna go, but...

222
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,770
对  我们商量过
Yeah, we were talking about it.

没事
Fine.

225
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:38,530
就是感觉太诡异了
That was just really weird.

226
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,950
什么诡异
What was?

227
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,760
就是
The...

228
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,070
去瑞典
Sweden.

229
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,150
我都不知道
I had no idea.

230
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,650
你什么意思
Well, what do you mean?

231
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,910
我跟你说过我想去
'Cause I told you I wanted to go.

232
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:06,850
好吧  但我不知道你真的要去
Okay, fine, but I didn't know you were going.

233
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,870
我今天才决定的
I just decided today.

234
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,380
我没有瞒着你
I wasn't keeping it from you.

235
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,590
你都准备好机票了
You already have a ticket.

236
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,400
对不起
I'm sorry?

237
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:29,040
好吧  你就
Okay, well, just,

238
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,270
想象如果你在一个派对上  有人问
imagine if you were at a party and someone said,

239
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,540
"暑假你有什么安排吗"
"Hey, what're you doing for summer?"

240
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,020
然后我的朋友说
And then my friend said,

241
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,230
"我们要去中国玩三个月"
"We're going to China for three months

242
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,480
"两周内就要启程了"
and we're leaving in two weeks..."

243
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,350
是瑞典  只去一个半月
It's Sweden, for a month and a half.

244
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,290
而且这是你第一次听说
And it was the first you'd ever heard of it.

245
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:43,990
好吧
Okay.

246
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,350
我跟你说过我想去瑞典
I told you I wanted to go to Sweden.

247
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,770
不  你说的是要能去也挺好的
No, you said it would be cool to go.

248
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:50,130
是啊  然后我有机会去了
Yeah, and then I got the opportunity

249
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:52,070
-我决定要去  -我不介意你去瑞典
- and I decided to do it. - Look, I don't mind you going.

250
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:54,380
我只是希望你能告诉我  没别的
I just wish you would've told me, that's all.

251
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,350
我刚才已经道歉了  丹妮
Well, I just apologized, Dani.

252
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,430
你没有道歉  你嘴里说着对不起
You didn't apologize, you said sorry,

253
00:16:59,430 --> 00:17:01,430
意思更像是"有什么办法"
which sounds more like, "Too bad."

254
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,630
我还是回家去吧
Maybe I should just go home.

255
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,300
什么  别别
What? No, no.

256
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,100
我只是想弄明白
I'm just trying to understand.

257
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,800
我只是想道歉
And I'm trying to apologize.

258
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,050
我不需要你道歉
And I don't need an apology.

259
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,710
不需要  我只是想说说这件事  没别的
I don't, I just wanted to talk about it, that's all.

260
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,010
我真的觉得我该走了
I really think I should just leave.

261
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:23,070
不不不  别走
No, no, no, no.

262
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:25,470
求你了  拜托  我不是想数落你
Please, please, please. I'm not... I'm not trying to attack you.

263
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,800
-听起来就是数落  -我没有
- It really feels like you are. - I'm not.

264
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,480
那...好吧  那我很抱歉
Well, then... Well, then I'm sorry.

265
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,600
我只是有些困惑  对不起  我...
I'm... I just got confused. I'm sorry, I...

266
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:34,130
拜托  过来  过来好吗
Please, c'mon, can you come?

267
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:36,540
-陪我坐一会儿好吗  -别这样
- Just can you come and sit with me, please? - Stop.

268
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,160
拜托  我们可以聊聊
Please, and we can talk about it.

269
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:41,830
真的...真的感觉很诡异  好吗
Look, it just... It just felt really weird, okay?

270
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,570
但我不介意  我觉得你要去瑞典是好事
But I'm fine, I think it's great that you're going to Sweden,

271
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,380
真的
I do.

272
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,230
天大的好事
I think it's amazing.

273
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,310
你去瑞典是为了写论文吗
Are you going for your thesis?

274
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:53,530
我都不知道论文课题是什么
I don't know what my thesis is.

275
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,360
我知道  去瑞典能让你...会让你...
I know and it... It can... It will...

276
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,170
能激发你的灵感  对吧
It can be inspiring, right?

277
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,080
对吧
Right?

278
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,330
拜托  我反应过激了  对不起
Please, I overreacted. I'm sorry.

279
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,650
对不起
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,550
我知道我总是想太多
I know I get paranoid.

281
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,650
我也不想这样
I don't mean to.

282
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:21,560
我知道我反应过激了  但我在努力振作
I know I overreacted, but I've been trying to pull myself back up,

283
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,140
我在努力应对惊恐不安的情绪
and ll've been trying to deal with this panic and my fears.

284
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:28,590
我不是想给你施加压力  或者埋怨你
I didn't mean to put pressure on you or to blame you for anything...

285
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:30,110
-行了  -我只是有点抓狂
- Okay. - I just got crazy for a second,

286
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,430
-行了  -我不是想强加到你身上
- Okay. Okay. - and I didn't mean to project.

287
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,680
-没关系  -对不起
- It's fine. - I'm sorry.

288
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,470
没关系
It's fine.

289
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,470
-真的对不起  -没关系
- I am sorry. - It's fine.

290
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,840
我本来就要邀请你和我一起去的
I was gonna ask you if you wanted to come with me.

291
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,280
什么
What?

292
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,590
-什么意思  -我刚说了
- What do you mean? - What I just said.

293
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,660
去瑞典
To Sweden?

294
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,210
你不想要我一起去
You don't want me to go.

295
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,960
我刚邀请你了
I just asked.

296
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,490
-是啊  在我崩溃之后  -你把惊喜给毁了
- Yeah, after I broke down crying. - Well, you ruined the surprise.

297
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,830
我本来想浪漫一下
I wanted it to be romantic.

298
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:42,390
我们去北方之前  能不能在斯德哥尔摩
In Stockholm, are there any, like, meatball sex clubs

299
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,260
找个经期性爱俱乐部玩玩
we should hit up before we head north?

300
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,210
不行  我们直接去北方
No, we're going straight north.

301
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,420
但也不是直接去北方吧
Not straight, straight, though, right?

302
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,370
我们肯定要途径斯德哥尔摩
We gotta go through Stockholm to get there.

303
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:53,270
不是  是在相反的方向
No, it's the opposite direction.

304
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:54,840
斯德哥尔摩在阿兰达机场的南边
Stockholm is south of Arlanda.

305
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,360
各位  是丹妮
Guys, it's Dani.

306

She's coming up.

307
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,310

308
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,950
-我们要把这里清理一下吗  -不用  没事
- Should we clear all this? - No, it's fine.

309

我邀请了丹妮一起去瑞典
I invited Dani to come to Sweden.

310

跟你们说一声
So you guys know.

311
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:18,700
她不会真的去的
She's not actually gonna come,

312
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:21,640
但我还是邀请她了  免得尴尬
but I invited her just to not make it weird.

313
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,610
你邀请了她去...
You invited her to...

314
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,790
但她不会去的
But she's not coming.

315
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,760
她不想去吗
She doesn't want to?

316
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,960
我邀请了她  她接受了
I invited her and she accepted,

317
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:38,620
但她不会真的去瑞典的
but she's not actually coming to Sweden.

318
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:40,230
好吧
Okay.

319
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,280
各位  你们知道她经历了什么
Guys, you know what she's been going through.

320
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:49,970
没事  老兄  我只是以为...
Yeah, no, dude, I just, uh, thought it was...

321
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,360
老兄  没人介意
Yeah, dude, nobody minds.

322
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,300
以为你要说其它的事  没别的
Thought you were saying something else, that's all.

323
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,490
那就好
Okay, that's great.

324
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:59,820
不过我们先说好  是你们叫我邀请她的
And just so we're clear, you guys told me to invite her

325
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,500
而且你们也知道她要来
and you all know that she's coming...

326
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,380

00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:19,270
瑞典是吧
So, Sweden.

334
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,640
-是啊  -你也一起去  是吧
- Yeah. - You're coming, right?

335
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,110
这个嘛
I mean, I...

336
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:24,680
应该是吧
I guess so,

337
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:27,180
如果你们的计划不会被我破坏的话
if that's not completely ruining you guys' plans.

338
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,050
-不会不会  -完全不会
- Oh, no, no. - No, not at all.

桌子而已
Just the table.

346
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,380

你呢
And you?

350
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,720
这学期我没上完
I didn't quite finish,

351
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,630
不过今年学校对我网开一面
but they're giving me a break this year.

352
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,050
对了  天啊  当然了  抱歉
God, yes, yes, of course. Sorry.

353
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,870

你觉得人类学系怎么样
How did you like the Anthropology department?

355
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:27,020
我挺喜欢的
I like it, yeah.

356
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:29,580
可能不像他那么喜欢  不过...
Not as much as this one maybe, but...

357
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,380
你学的是精神病学  对吧
You're doing psychiatry, right?

358
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,020
心理学  是的
Psychology, yeah.

359

00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,010
是啊  而且你的眼神很古怪
Yeah, also that funny look in your eye.

361
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,300
你要一起去海尔辛兰
So you're coming to Halsingland?

362
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:44,890
应该是吧
I guess so, yeah.

363

-生日快乐  -谢谢
- Well, happy birthday. - Thank you!

365
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:55,930
克里斯蒂安说你安排了一周的特别活动
Yeah, Christian says you've got this special week planned.

366
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:59,560
是的  我家人要庆祝一个为期九天的疯狂节日
Yeah, it's sort of a crazy nine-day festival my family's doing.

367

各种庆典
Lots of pageantry...

368
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,350
特殊仪式  还要盛装打扮

369
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,570
听起来很有趣
That sounds fun.

370
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,820
看起来可能会很傻
It'll probably seem very silly.

371
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,040
不过有点像戏剧
But, it's like theater.

372
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,900
克里斯蒂安说你
Yeah, Christian says you're...

373

你是在一个公社长大的  是吗

374
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,930
是的  我们是一个小社群

376
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,010
我明白你说的庆典是什么意思了
I see what you mean about the pageantry.

377
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:29,970
这些服装是为每年的冬至和夏至
Yeah, we make those clothes special for every

378
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,980

379
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,970
基本上做什么事大家都在一起
I mean, everybody sort of does everything together.

380
00:23:34,970 --> 00:23:36,860
这个符号很有意思
That's an interesting symbol.

381
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,690
是的  我们都要学卢恩字母
Yeah, we're taught the Runic alphabet, so...

Who's that one?

383
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,190
这是去年的五月女王
That's last year's May Queen.

384
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,470
真漂亮
Beautiful.

385
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:51,150

听到你失去亲人的消息我很难过
I was so very sorry to hear about your loss.

392
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,740
发生那样的事
What happened, I mean,

393
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,360
我简直无法想象
I can't even imagine.

394
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:15,070
我是说
I mean...

395
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,990
-我也失去了父母  所以...  -好吧
- I lost my parents, too, so... - Okay.

396
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,580
我大概能体会
I kind of have some idea.

397
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,380
-抱歉  -不

你明知他用平底锅打老婆
and he's, like, reading out the news

418
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,780

Why are you reading that.

423
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:53,130
问佩尔
Ask pelle.

424
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,850
我们村里的人都要学卢恩字母
We're taught the runic alphabet in my village,

425
00:26:56,850 --> 00:26:59,650
所以乔希随身带着那本书来气我
so Josh just carries that around to annoy me.

426
00:27:01,350 --> 00:27:03,270
你的论文课题是什么来着
What are you doing your thesis on again.

427
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,910
主要是关于欧洲仲夏节传统的
Well, my focus is actually on European midsummer traditions,

428
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:12,560
也就是我们这趟旅行的动力
which was basically the impetus for this whole trip that we're all on.

429
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,790
这听起来和你想研究的差不多  对吧
Hey, that sounds similar to what you're thinking of doing, right?

430
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,770
你论文要写的
For your thesis.

431
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:23,000
你知道的  我还不知道论文要写什么
Well, I don't know exactly what I'm doing it on yet, as you know.

432
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
不过我在考虑写斯堪的纳维亚相关的  是的
But I'm thinking of rooting it in something Scandinavian, yeah.

433
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:29,500
看见没  佩尔
See that, pelle.

434
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,170
你成功把所有朋友都洗脑了
You've managed to brainwash all of your friends.

435
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,780
乔希早就被洗脑了  用不着我
Josh was already brainwashed when I found him.

436
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:26,800
{\an8}海尔辛兰

437
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,680
{\an8}海尔辛兰

438
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,640
好了  这里是第一站
Okay, this is the first stop.

439
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,860
我们到了吗
This is it?

440
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,080
还没到  不过快了
Not quite, almost.

441
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,320

442
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,380
-真美  -天呐

443
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,990

Hey, guys, so these are younger people from my village.

444

老兄  这里虫子太多
Yeah, dude, there's so many bugs.

450
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,860
很美吧

你觉得他认识那个人吗
You think he knows that guy?

457
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,440
他听起来很生气
He sounded mad.

458
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,260
肯定是好话
That must be good.

459
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,120

我们五分钟前刚吃了这个
We... we just took these five minutes ago.

475

还没嗨起来呢
Haven't even started coming up yet.

476
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,280
我去
Oh, shit!

477
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,120
你们是想先吃还是先安顿下来
Do you guys wanna take it now or should we settle in first?

478
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,640
管它呢  我们现在就吃吧
Fuck it, let's just take it now, right?

479
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,980
-行  -好
- Yeah. Yeah. - Great.

You know what,

如果可以的话  我想先落脚
I might have to find my footing first if that's okay.

-好  没问题  -那就好

And listen, if you're feeling uneasy,

484
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,710
根本就不用吃
you don't have to take them at all.

485
00:30:57,710 --> 00:31:00,610
不不不  我只想先安顿下来
No. No, no, no. I just... I wanna feel settled first.

老兄  我们不能在不同的时间吃
Dude, we can't take them at different times,

493
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,240
嗨的步调会错开的
they'll be totally separate trips.

494
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:22,330
那你想等我们吗
You wanna wait for us then?

495

没事的  马克  这是午夜的阳光
It's okay, Mark. It's the midnight sun.

他们在嘲笑我
They were laughing at me.

563

You're okay, you're okay, you're okay.

569
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,450
我睡了多久
How long was I asleep?

570
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,790
我们大概六小时前在这里找到你的
I mean, we found you here, like, six hours ago.

571
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,880
天黑过吗
Did it get dark at all?

572
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,930
暗过几个小时  但没有完全黑
For a couple of hours, not completely.

573
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,350
现在是明天吗
Is it tomorrow?

574
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,020
从昨天算的话是的
I mean, from yesterday's perspective.

575
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:56,440
来吧
Come on.

576
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,530
我们要去哪
Where are we going?

577
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:03,240
去要去的地方
What we came for.

578
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:44,820
老天  佩尔  你要带我们去哪
Jesus, Pelle, where are you taking us?

579
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,780
这地方也太远了吧
Yeah, this is way the hell out there.

580
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:52,950
瑞典有蜱虫吗
Do they have ticks in Sweden?

581
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:55,370
瑞典的蜱虫问题很严峻

00:37:57,220 --> 00:37:58,430
没这回事吧  真的吗
No they don't, do they really?

584
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,130
蜱虫真是个大问题
Actually, it is a big problem.

585
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,890
去年夏天  感染森林脑炎的人数

587
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,920
什么鬼  你说真的吗
What the fuck? Are you serious?

588
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:08,180
我祖父母都死于蜱虫病
Both my grandparents died from ticks.

589
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,230
葬礼上都不能打开棺材
Had to give them a closed casket funeral.

590
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:13,640
乔希  我还真有个得莱姆病的叔叔
Okay, Josh, I actually have an uncle with Lyme.

591
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:15,280
相信我  如果你问他
And believe me, if you ask him,

592
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,310
他会说为野餐付出的代价太惨重了
it was not worth the pleasant picnic in the park.

593
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,940
他完蛋了
He's fucked.

594
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,900
就是这里了
So, this is the place.

598
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,680
我们要先在邪教阵地逗留
So we're stopping in Waco

599
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,870
然后再去佩尔的村子吗

很女气对吧
Yeah, quite girly, no?

624
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:01,650
我们这么穿是为了表达对约弥尔的敬意

625
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,770

我们已经有了如此多的可回馈之物
We already have so much to give back

654
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,550

709
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,820
他们把它放在枕头下面  梦想着它的力量
They put it under their pillow and dream about its powers.

710
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,870
对  我也这么做
Oh, yeah. I do that, too.

711

早期弗赛克文
The Younger Futhark.

715
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,310
我觉得是  或者是中世纪吗
I... I think? Or is that medieval?

716
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:35,510
其实是晚期弗赛克文
Actually, that is the Elder Futhark.

717
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,300
你们俩在一起多久了
So, how long have you two been together?

718
00:50:38,810 --> 00:50:40,470
天啊  我想想

没错  是四年

725
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:59,700
嗯  你们怎么认识的
Yeah, um, how did you guys all meet?

726
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,660
我们在同一个农场工作
We were all working on the same farm

727
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:07,630
有意思的是  西蒙和我刚成为朋友的时候
and funny enough, I was dating Connie

728
00:51:07,630 --> 00:51:09,580
我和康妮在谈恋爱
when Simon and me first became pals.

729
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:11,830
我们就约会了一次
Well, we'd been on a date.

730
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,680
当时我都不知道那是个约会
And I didn't even actually know it was a date, so...

731
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:15,350
你说得对  不  没有
You're right. No, no.

732
00:51:15,350 --> 00:51:17,940
我的意思是康妮和我刚成为朋友
I meant that Connie and me had just become friends.

733
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,670
我们  我们决定做朋友
We... We decided to be friends.

734
00:51:19,770 --> 00:51:23,180
就在康妮和西蒙开始谈恋爱之前
And that was just before Connie and Simon started dating.

735
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,640
现在他们订婚了
And now they're engaged.

736
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:27,860

738
00:51:29,870 --> 00:51:32,990

739
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:34,080
来主持婚礼
to officiate the wedding.

740
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:35,360
-真的吗  -假的
- Really? - Nah.

741
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,780
那个房子是干什么的
What's that building over there?

742
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:41,130
那是圣殿
It's like a sacred temple,

743
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,360
但禁止入内
but no one's allowed in there.

744
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,240
我带你们去看我们休息的地方
Let me show you where we sleep.

745
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,370
我带你们去看颠倒树
Let me show you the Rotvalta!

746
00:51:50,470 --> 00:51:52,290
我们就无视那头熊吗
So we're just gonna ignore the bear then?

747
00:51:53,220 --> 00:51:54,040
的确是一头熊
It's a bear.

748
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:00,470
那是什么
What's that?

749
00:52:01,980 --> 00:52:04,140
-我们可以去看看  -好

752
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:09,700
天呐
Oh, man.

753
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:12,660
就像圣经一样
It's like in the Scripture.

754
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:17,880
你们觉得怎么样
What do you think?

755
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,380
就像是另一个世界
It's like another world.

756
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:23,260
美轮美奂
Amazing.

757
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:25,680
大家就在这里睡吗
People just sleep here?

758
00:53:25,770 --> 00:53:28,020
没错  36岁以下的年轻人都睡在这里
Yeah, all the younger ones until we turn 36

759
00:53:28,030 --> 00:53:29,720
然后我们就搬进工人的房子里
and then we move to the laborers house.

760
00:53:29,860 --> 00:53:30,890
为什么是36岁
Why 36?

761
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:33,490
我们觉得人生就像四季
Well, we think of life like the seasons.

762
00:53:33,490 --> 00:53:36,270
18岁之前你还是孩子  那是春季
So you're a child until you're 18 and that's Spring.

763
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,450
然后在18到36岁的某个时刻
And then at some point, we all do our Pilgrimage

764
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,520
我们都要踏上朝圣之旅
which is between 18 and 36.

765
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:44,860
那是夏季  然后从36岁到54岁
That's Summer, and then from 36 to 54,

766
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,110
我们步入了工作的年龄  那是秋季
we're working age, which is Fall.

767
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,950
最终54到72岁时你就成了导师
And then finally from 54 to 72 you become a mentor.

768
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,370
72岁会发生什么
What happens at 72?

769
00:53:58,680 --> 00:53:59,880
这里没什么隐私
Not a lot of privacy.

770
00:54:00,390 --> 00:54:02,300
是啊  如果要自慰的话怎么办
Yeah, what do you do when you need to jerk off?

771
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,980
尤其是墙上还有这么多阴茎
Especially with all these dicks on the wall.

772
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,920
很多阴茎
There's a lot of dicks.

773
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,690
你看  那家伙不听我说
See, man, that guy dismissed me,

774
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:12,390
但这与锡克教圣徒或阿佛洛狄特斯崇拜一模一样
but this is exactly like the sakhis saints and the cult of Aphroditus.

就好像他们是故意把饭弄得这么恶心
It's like they're trying to make it gross.

842
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:34,620

-是吧  -是的

845
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:51,350
她的母亲在进行朝圣之旅
Her... Her mother is on Pilgrimage.

846
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,850
有助于让她脱离母亲的怀抱
Helps her to detach.

847

Okay.

你想要吗
You want this?

850
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:10,190
你说如果我现在把手指
What do you think that guy's reaction would be

851
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:12,280
捅进那家伙的屁股  他会作何反应
if I just put my finger in his butt right now?

852
01:05:05,510 --> 01:05:07,000
你要跟他们一起去吗
Dude, are you following them out?

853
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,140
我太困了  我要去眯一下
I'm beat. I'm gonna go take a nap.

854
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:11,630
-好的  -好
- Okay, okay. Yeah. - Yeah.

等等  我们现在要干什么
Wait, what're we doing now?

《鲁比拉达》  我们的圣典

Can I read that?

859
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,510
你读不了
You would not be able.

860
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:18,900
天啊
Oh, my God!

861
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:23,750

863
01:10:25,400 --> 01:10:26,400
搞什么
What the...

没事的
It's okay.

It's okay, it's fine. Don't worry.

872
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:39,480
没事是什么意思
What do you mean it's fine?

873
01:10:39,480 --> 01:10:41,510
她死了  看她的头
She's fucking dead. Look at her head!

看她的头  她死了

她从悬崖上跳下来了

我们不会老去
Instead of getting old

向无可避免之事作出反抗
lashing back at the inevitable.

那会让灵魂腐坏

他的秘书在车里给他口交
in his car while driving on the freeway.

934
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:32,140
不幸的是  他需要急刹车  结果被追尾了
Unfortunately, he needed to make a sudden stop and was rear-ended,

935
01:15:32,140 --> 01:15:34,700
惊得女秘书狠狠一口咬下去
startling his protegee into biting down with such...

936
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,080
仪式怎么样
How was the thing?

937
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:43,930
以致于他的阴茎被干脆地咬断了
...brute force that his penis was severed clean from his body.

938
01:15:44,030 --> 01:15:45,970

怎么样  伙计

01:16:14,780 --> 01:16:16,220
你还好吗
Are you okay?

945
01:16:16,820 --> 01:16:18,260
我没事
Yeah, I'm fine.

946
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:19,910

听我说
Hey, listen.

948
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:29,820
我一直在考虑
I've been thinking about something

949
01:16:29,820 --> 01:16:31,110
有件事想问你
that I wanted to ask you.

950
01:16:31,110 --> 01:16:33,490
或者应该说  想告诉你
Or tell you, actually.

951
01:16:39,270 --> 01:16:42,450
我一直在考虑我的论文
I've been thinking a lot about my thesis.

952
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:43,940
然后
And,

953
01:16:44,610 --> 01:16:47,760
我决定要以哈加为课题
I've decided I'm gonna do it here. On Harga.

954
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:50,680
我想先告诉你一下
And I wanted to tell you first.

955
01:16:50,680 --> 01:16:54,040
这样你就不会觉得我有意瞒着你
Just so it didn't seem like I wasn't telling you.

956
01:16:57,200 --> 01:16:59,960
我不确定你是不是在开玩笑
I feel like... I feel like I can't tell if you're joking.

957
01:17:04,680 --> 01:17:05,310
我是说
I mean... I mean,

958
01:17:05,310 --> 01:17:07,490
你知道仲夏节是我的论文课题
you know I'm doing my thesis on midsummer.

959
01:17:07,490 --> 01:17:09,910
-所以我才要来这里  -嗯
- That's the reason why I'm here. - Yeah.

960
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:14,220

Yeah, but not on this community.

961
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,480
接下来你还要去德国和英格兰
I mean, you're going to Germany and England next.

962
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:21,750
你肯定知道我想写这个
Well, you knew I was gonna wanna do this.

963
01:17:23,800 --> 01:17:25,850
-不  我不知道  -天啊
- No, I didn't. - Oh, my God.

964
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,210
你难道不是刚刚才决定的吗
I mean, did you even know until just now?

965
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,120
克里斯蒂安  你当然知道
Christian, of course you did!

966
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,180
你以为我看不透
Okay, do you think I don't know

967
01:17:30,280 --> 01:17:31,740
你的伎俩吗
what you're doing?

968
01:17:32,390 --> 01:17:35,100
明目张胆到都有点过分了
It's actually kind of outrageously unsubtle.

969
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,620
你居然这么不要脸
The fact that you're being this bald about it.

970
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,270
我还挺佩服你的
I'm... I'm honestly kind of impressed.

971
01:17:40,950 --> 01:17:42,080
什么鬼  你说什么呢
What the fuck, man? What does that mean?

972
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:43,110
对啊  什么鬼
Yeah, what the fuck!

973
01:17:43,110 --> 01:17:45,920

This is what I've been working toward and you know it.

974
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,350
所以你现在满脸内疚  因为你明白
That's why you look so guilty right now, because you know.

975
01:17:48,350 --> 01:17:49,740
你明白自己的行为
You know that what you're doing

976
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,240
不道德且懒惰  是占便宜
is unethical and leechy and lazy.

977
01:17:52,240 --> 01:17:54,300
说实话  还有点可悲
And, frankly, it's kind of sad.

978
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,390
-去你的  -不  老兄  别说我
- Fuck you! - No, dude, not fuck me!

979
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:59,160
找你自己的课题去
Find your own subject.

980
01:17:59,290 --> 01:18:00,810
或是你自己的兴趣
Or... Or your own passion.

981
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,660
因为  好吧听着
And, because... All right, look.

982
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:06,020
这个研究我真的很投入
I am... I'm actually invested in this.

983
01:18:06,810 --> 01:18:08,400
这不是什么好听的
This is not some glorified hobby

984
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,430
随便玩玩的爱好
that I'm casually dipping my feet into.

985
01:18:10,430 --> 01:18:11,750
行了
Okay.

986
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:14,360
殿下  您可能没注意到
In case you hadn't noticed, your highness,

987
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:16,210
我们都是博士研究生
we're doing the exact same degree.

988
01:18:16,210 --> 01:18:18,900
但态度完全不同  克里斯蒂安
No, but not in the same way, Christian.

989
01:18:18,940 --> 01:18:23,240
懂吗  什么事都得我手把手教你
Okay? I have to hold your little hand through everything.

990
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:26,580
要不是我教你  你连期刊网站都不会用
You didn't even know how to use JSTOR until I taught you,

991
01:18:26,580 --> 01:18:28,770
你他妈可是研究生啊
and you are a fucking grad student.

992
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,070
你到底为什么搞学术
Why are you even in academia?

993
01:18:31,070 --> 01:18:34,430
你根本不在乎  这没问题  这是你的自由
You don't care! Which is fine. That is your prerogative.

994
01:18:34,430 --> 01:18:38,660
但你别想抢我的心血走捷径
But do not appropriate my actual work for your new shortcut.

995
01:18:46,150 --> 01:18:47,940
我的论文要写这里
I'm gonna do my thesis here.

996
01:18:48,880 --> 01:18:50,300
如果你也有一样的打算
If you're gonna do it here too,

997
01:18:50,300 --> 01:18:52,050
我不介意与你合作
I'm open to collaborating.

998
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:53,800
如果你不愿意
And if not,

999
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:56,760
那我们就各写各的  都写哈加
I guess we can both do separate theses on the Hargas.

1000
01:19:03,910 --> 01:19:06,250
老兄  我居然一觉睡过了那么精彩的事
Dude, of all the things to let me sleep through.

1001
01:19:06,450 --> 01:19:07,780
什么
What?

1002
01:19:18,270 --> 01:19:19,300
我们明天早上就走
We're leaving tomorrow morning.

1003
01:19:19,300 --> 01:19:20,650
我知道
I know we are.

1004
01:19:28,620 --> 01:19:31,490
抱歉  你好  我不想打扰你
Sorry, um... Hi. I don't mean to disturb you.

1005
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,350
你好
Hello.

1006
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:36,290
你好  我叫克里斯蒂安
Hi, I'm Christian.

1007
01:19:42,240 --> 01:19:45,300
你好  我叫乌拉
Hello. My name is Ulla.

1008
01:19:45,300 --> 01:19:48,270
-乌拉  -乌拉  她叫玛雅
- Ulla. - Ulla. And this is Maja.

1009
01:19:48,270 --> 01:19:49,300
玛雅  你好
Maja, hi.

1010
01:19:51,790 --> 01:19:53,330
你们在做什么
What are you guys doing?

1011
01:19:53,670 --> 01:19:56,280
我们在装饰这棵树
We are decorating the tree.

1012
01:19:57,110 --> 01:20:00,750
嗯  我能不能问你一个问题
Right. Um, I was wondering if I could ask you a question.

1013
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:02,300
-可以  -你看过...
- Of course. - How many...

1014
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:07,210
你看过几次阿特斯图帕...仪式
How many times have you seen Attestupa... performed?

1015
01:20:07,480 --> 01:20:09,580
-阿特斯图帕  -阿特斯图帕
- "Attestupa." - "Attestupa."

1016
01:20:09,580 --> 01:20:11,020
你看过几次仪式
How many times you've seen it performed?

1017
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,670
有人达到年龄就会举行  所以...
Every time one reaches age, so...

1018
01:20:16,980 --> 01:20:18,940
-好吧  -很多次
- Okay. - A lot.

1019
01:20:18,990 --> 01:20:20,330
好的
Okay.

1020
01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:24,670
你们通常有没有  哀悼的阶段
And do you have a typical... period of grieving?

1021
01:20:24,670 --> 01:20:27,580
哀悼一段时间
Is there a-a time when you mourn?

1022
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,730
我们哀悼并庆祝
We grieve and celebrate.

1023
01:20:33,610 --> 01:20:36,180
-是的  -好的  明白了
- Yes. - Okay. I see.

1024
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:37,920
我已经跟克里斯蒂安说了
I told Christian this already,

1025
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:39,960
我觉得他想装成这是他自己想出来的
and now I think he's trying to pretend like it's his idea,

1026
01:20:39,960 --> 01:20:41,640
-所以如果他来找你...  -不
- so if he comes up to you... - Well, no,

1027
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,610
等一下  我真的不认为
wait a minute. I... I seriously doubt that

1028
01:20:43,610 --> 01:20:45,710
长老们会允许你们留下书面记录
the elders will approve of anything being written down.

1029
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:46,840
他们的保护欲非常强
They're extremely protective.

1030
01:20:46,840 --> 01:20:48,670
好吧  那我就全用假名代替
Okay, so then, I'll just use aliases for everything.

1031
01:20:48,670 --> 01:20:50,260
-问题解决了  -那还有什么意义
- Problem solved. - Then what would be the point?

1032
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:52,120
你甚至都不能进行同行评审
You couldn't even get it peer reviewed.

1033
01:20:52,120 --> 01:20:54,260
顺便一提  克里斯蒂安已经问过我了
And Christian did already ask me this, by the way,

1034
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,500
我的回答是一样的
and I told him the same thing I'm telling you now.

1035
01:20:57,260 --> 01:20:59,420
你不是说没跟他谈过吗
I thought you said you hadn't talked to him.

1036
01:20:59,640 --> 01:21:00,780
该死  不是
Fuck. No.

1037
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:02,980
好吧  我会去问长老们
Okay, look, uh, I'll ask the elders.

1038
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:04,950
-行吗  -行
- Okay? Good. - Yep.

1039
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:17,330
丹妮
Dani?

1040
01:21:20,090 --> 01:21:21,250
我真的很抱歉  佩尔
I'm really sorry, Pelle.

1041
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:23,640
感谢你邀请我来  但我  我真得走了
Thank you for inviting me, but I... I really have to go.

1042
01:21:23,640 --> 01:21:24,440
有人能开车送我一下吗
Can someone maybe drive me somewhere?

1043
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,750
我知道我不该让你看到那一幕
I know I shouldn't have let you stay for that.

1044
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:29,650
我知道看起来很极端  但我们只是...
I mean, I know it looks extreme. But we only...

1045
01:21:29,650 --> 01:21:31,560
我不明白我为什么来这里  佩尔
I don't know why I'm here, Pelle!

1046
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,130
我不明白你为什么邀请我们来
I don't know why you invited us.

1047
01:21:33,130 --> 01:21:34,410
我不明白  我不明白为什么...
I don't know. I don't know why...

1048
01:21:34,410 --> 01:21:35,830
-我不明白我为什么来这里  -没事没事
- I don't know why I'm here. - Okay, okay, okay.

1049
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:37,740
-没事的  没关系  -我不明白  我不...
- It's fine. It's okay. - I don't know and I can't...

1050
01:21:37,810 --> 01:21:39,630
-来  来  坐下  -不
- Come on. Come on, sit down. - No.

1051
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:40,820
丹妮  拜托
Dani, please.

1052
01:21:40,820 --> 01:21:42,250
坐下好吗
Please sit down.

1053
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:44,750
丹妮
Dani.

1054
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:48,160
我邀请我的朋友们来
I invited my friends

1055
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:49,810
是因为这是千载难逢的体验
because this is a once-in-a-lifetime thing,

1056
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,180
我想和你们分享
and I wanted to share it.

1057
01:21:51,180 --> 01:21:54,770
特别是我知道我的朋友里有人能够领会
Especially with my friends who I knew would appreciate it.

1058
01:21:54,770 --> 01:21:56,110
因为我
Because I...

1059
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:57,750
-我为这里感到骄傲  -好吧
- I am proud of this place. - Okay.

1060
01:21:57,750 --> 01:21:59,340
好吧  但我不是人类学家
Okay, but I'm not an anthropologist

1061
01:21:59,340 --> 01:22:00,610
我一点也不理解这些
and I don't understand any of this.

1062
01:22:00,610 --> 01:22:01,700
-是是是  我知道  -我搞不懂
- Yes, yes, yes. I know. - I don't get it.

1063
01:22:01,700 --> 01:22:02,830
我知道  但是
I know. And, and yet,

1064
01:22:02,830 --> 01:22:05,440
你能来我是最激动的
I was the most excited for you to come.

1065
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:09,950
来  闻下这个
Here. Here, smell this.

1066
01:22:11,660 --> 01:22:12,890
这是什么
What is it?

1067
01:22:12,890 --> 01:22:14,750
-能让你冷静下来  -不  我没事
- It calms you down. - No, I'm fine.

1068
01:22:14,750 --> 01:22:16,250
我不想闻
I don't want it.

1069
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:19,190
-你确定吗  -不用
- Are you sure? - No...

1070
01:22:19,190 --> 01:22:21,750
我真的想走  佩尔  我不  我不想闻
I really want to go, Pelle. I don't... I don't want it.

1071
01:22:21,750 --> 01:22:23,000
好吧
Okay.

1072
01:22:24,330 --> 01:22:26,350
我明白你现在的感受  丹妮
I know what you're going through, Dani.

1073
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:30,030
我现在的感受
What am I going through?

1074
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,460
因为我也失去了父母
Because I lost my parents, too.

1075
01:22:31,460 --> 01:22:33,630
-什么  不不  佩尔  -是是
- What? No, no, Pelle. - Yes, yes, yes...

1076
01:22:33,630 --> 01:22:34,990
我不是在说这个
That is not what I'm talking about.

1077
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:37,220
-我知道你不是在说这个  -我不是在说我的家人
- I know that's not what you're talking about. - I'm not talking about my family.

1078
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:39,540
-我很小的时候父母就去世了  -我不是在说我的家人
- I lost my parents when I was a little boy. - I'm not talking about my family...

1079
01:22:39,540 --> 01:22:40,430
他们在火中丧生
They burned up in a fire.

1080
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:42,550
不  我不是在说这个
No, I wasn't talking about that.

1081
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:45,830
我的父母  在火中丧生
My parents, they burned up in a fire

1082
01:22:45,830 --> 01:22:48,880
严格来说  我就成了孤儿
and I became, technically, an orphan.

1083
01:22:48,920 --> 01:22:51,870
所以请相信我理解你的感受
So believe me when I tell you that I know what it's like.

1084
01:22:51,870 --> 01:22:54,610
因为我真的懂  我懂  我懂
Because I do, I really, really do.

1085
01:22:57,490 --> 01:23:00,690
不过我和你的不同在于我从未体会过迷茫
Yet my difference is, I never got the chance to feel lost,

1086
01:23:00,690 --> 01:23:04,050
因为我在这里有个家
because I had a family here.

1087
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:08,960
大家都接纳我  拥抱我
Where everyone embraced me. And swept me up.

1088
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:12,020
养大我的这个社群
And I was raised by a community

1089
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:16,170
不会计较输赢得失
that doesn't bicker over what's theirs and what's not theirs.

1090
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,760
和你的社群不同
That's what you were given.

1091
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:22,100
我一直都有坚强的后盾
But I have always felt held.

1092
01:23:26,090 --> 01:23:29,640
有一个家  一个真正的家
By a family. A real family.

1093
01:23:34,540 --> 01:23:36,380
每个人都值得拥有
Which everyone deserves.

1094
01:23:38,300 --> 01:23:39,830
你也值得
And you deserve.

1095
01:23:46,940 --> 01:23:48,580
佩尔  克里斯蒂安可能会进来
Pelle, Christian could walk in.

1096
01:23:48,580 --> 01:23:50,370
我说的就是他
He's what I'm talking about.

1097
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:55,690
他是个好朋友  我喜欢他  但是
He's my good friend and I like him, but...

1098
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,350
丹妮  你觉得他是你的后盾吗
Dani, do you feel held by him?

1099
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:04,300
他有给你家的感觉吗
Does he feel like home to you?

1100
01:24:46,570 --> 01:24:48,000
你怎么样
How you doing?

1101
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:50,550
今天不好过
Today was tough.

1102
01:24:53,670 --> 01:24:55,240
你不会有事吧
You gonna be okay?

1103
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:00,300
刚刚看到的事你没觉得不安吗
Are you not disturbed by what we just saw?

1104
01:25:00,690 --> 01:25:02,860
我当然觉得不安
Yeah, of course I am.

1105
01:25:03,600 --> 01:25:06,280
太令人震惊了
That was really, really shocking.

1106
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:10,470
不过我想保持开放的心态
I'm trying to keep an open mind though.

1107
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:14,000
这是一种文化  明白吗
That's cultural, you know?

1108
01:25:14,900 --> 01:25:17,040
我们把老人塞进养老院
We stick our elders in nursing homes.

1109
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:19,330
他们肯定觉得那才是令人不安
I'm sure they find that disturbing.

1110
01:25:22,880 --> 01:25:24,190
你们好
Hello.

1111
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:28,360
你们想来参加我们的特殊仪式吗
Would you like to be joining us with a special ceremony?

1112
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,510
怎么了  什么仪式
Why? What's happening now?

1113
01:25:47,600 --> 01:25:55,530
{\pos(192.3,225.2)}女神大人  怀着感激及赞颂  我们向您献上这份薄礼

1114
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:12,420
{\pos(192.3,250.2)}不好

1115
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:17,440
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你们有没有听到那咕噜声

1116
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:21,640
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我想她还没吃饱

1117
01:26:23,020 --> 01:26:26,040
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我没听到咕噜声

1118
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:29,510
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你们有听到吗

1119
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:35,060
{\pos(192.3,225.2)}好吧  可能是我的肚子在咕噜

1120
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:38,700
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}但是

1121
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:43,170
{\pos(192.3,225.2)}万一冒犯到仁慈的母亲就不好了

1122
01:26:43,890 --> 01:26:46,310
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}说得对

1123
01:26:46,310 --> 01:26:51,510
{\pos(192.3,225.2)}但是我们已经献上了最漂亮的宝石和最多产的果树

1124
01:26:51,510 --> 01:26:55,220
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我们还能献上什么

1125
01:26:56,490 --> 01:26:58,430
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你们可献上我

1126
01:27:10,220 --> 01:27:12,380
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你  小布鲁尔

1127
01:27:13,180 --> 01:27:17,300
{\pos(192.3,225.2)}想把自己的生命献给我们敬爱的女神

1128
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:19,480
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}如果她接受的话

1129
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:24,150
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你真勇敢  小布鲁尔

1130
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:28,510
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}勇敢  回到她的怀抱有何勇敢可言

1131
01:27:58,600 --> 01:27:59,980
这是干什么
What's happening?

1132
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:07,550
这是干什么
What's happening?

1133
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:15,220
不  等等  住手
No, wait, wait. Stop!

1134
01:28:15,220 --> 01:28:15,720
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}不

1135
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:16,860
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}停下

1136
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:19,870
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}放开他  他已经展示了勇气

1137
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:56,650
你能慢点吗  等一下  宝贝
Okay, can you slow down? Just wait a sec, babe.

1138
01:28:56,650 --> 01:29:00,100
拜托  克里斯蒂安  这真的很不对劲
Please, Christian, this is feeling really wrong.

1139
01:29:00,100 --> 01:29:01,620
我们得走了
We need to leave.

1140
01:29:02,410 --> 01:29:04,370
我知道这很奇怪
I know that this is weird,

1141
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:06,120
-因为这是异国文化  -不
- but it's because it's alien. - No...

1142
01:29:06,120 --> 01:29:08,820
-我们没接触过这种文化  -不  克里斯蒂安
- We haven't been exposed to anything like this. - No, Christian.

1143
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:11,300
拜托  这里简直还未开化  我们得走了
No, please. This is completely backwards. We need to leave.

1144
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:14,350
-我们只是需要适应  -我不想适应  我想走
- We just need to acclimate. - I don't want to acclimate. I want to go.

1145
01:29:14,850 --> 01:29:17,340
我不能走  对不起  没得商量
Well, I can't. I'm sorry. Period.

1146
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:20,230
我的论文要写这里
I'm doing my thesis on this.

1147
01:29:20,230 --> 01:29:22,190
什么  什么时候的事
What? Since when

1148
01:29:22,290 --> 01:29:25,140
我今天决定的
Since I decided today.

1149
01:29:25,650 --> 01:29:28,230
你知道选课题这事让我有多煎熬
You know how much of a nightmare this has been for me to figure out.

1150
01:29:28,230 --> 01:29:29,790
我还犯了个错  把这事告诉乔希了
And I've made the mistake of telling Josh,

1151
01:29:29,790 --> 01:29:31,070
现在他要跟我竞争
and now he's competing with me.

1152
01:29:31,070 --> 01:29:34,580
他想写就让他写吧  我们得走了
So if he wants it, let him have it. We need to leave.

1153
01:29:35,300 --> 01:29:38,020
你看不清这里的情况吗
Can you not see what's going on here?

1154
01:29:38,020 --> 01:29:39,780
这种级别的传统
This level of tradition?

1155
01:29:40,420 --> 01:29:42,980
没人见过  没人发表过
No one's seen this. No one's written anything on it.

1156
01:29:42,980 --> 01:29:44,780
而他们邀请我们来参与
And they've invited us to be a part of it.

1157
01:29:44,780 --> 01:29:47,410
-他们为什么邀请我们  -你不明白这有多难得吗
- Why have they invited us? - Can't you see what a privilege that is?

1158
01:29:48,180 --> 01:29:49,850
-因为佩尔邀请了  -佩尔为什么邀请
- Because Pelle did. - Why did Pelle?

1159
01:29:49,850 --> 01:29:52,760
-因为他信任我们  -他们为什么要信任我们
- Because he trusts us. - Why would they trust us?

1160
01:29:52,950 --> 01:29:55,790
你们是一帮投机取巧的人类学学生
You're opportunistic anthropology students.

1161
01:29:55,790 --> 01:29:57,860
也许正是因为我们是人类学学生
Maybe because we're anthropology students.

1162
01:29:57,860 --> 01:29:58,520
-天呐  -也许他们想要
- Oh, my God. - Maybe they want

1163
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,010
-你是睁眼瞎吗  -找个人记录这一切
- Are you fucking blind? - someone to document this. 

1164
01:30:01,530 --> 01:30:05,150
他们举行的是异教仪式  有人从悬崖上跳下来
They're doing pagan rituals. People are jumping off cliffs.

1165
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:08,110
他们的存续全靠永远不让外人知道
They depend on no one knowing about this ever.

1166
01:30:08,530 --> 01:30:10,100
不一定
Not necessarily.

1167
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:14,910
好吧  我想走
Okay. I want to leave.

1168
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,180
好吧  那你可以走  但我要留下
Okay, then you can leave. But I'm staying.

1169
01:30:21,480 --> 01:30:25,280
我邀请了你  这我不后悔  但我是有目的而来的
I invited you, and I don't regret that, but I'm here for a reason.

1170
01:30:32,550 --> 01:30:34,300
你是不是不爱我了
Do you not love me anymore?

1171
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:44,450
那和这有什么关系
What does that have to do with this?

1172
01:30:45,050 --> 01:30:46,850
我们处于贬值阶段
We're in the devaluation phase.

1173
01:30:46,850 --> 01:30:49,800
已经很长时间了  下一步就是丢弃
We've been in it for a long time, and next comes discard.

1174
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:53,960
别用你心理学课本上那一套来分析我们的关系好吗
Can we spare our relationship your textbook psychology keywords?

1175
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,160
我们已经这样很长时间了
We've been in this for a while.

1176
01:30:56,710 --> 01:30:59,920
你试图抽身  我不肯面对
You've been trying to pull away, and I've been in denial.

1177
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:09,250
你可得好好夸夸自己  宝贝
Please. Give yourself some credit, babe.

1178
01:31:09,810 --> 01:31:12,050
看来你已经弄得明明白白了
Looks like you've got this all figured out.

1179
01:31:12,250 --> 01:31:13,650
什么
What?

1180
01:31:16,290 --> 01:31:18,960
转念一想  有件事我不吐不快
Actually, you know what? I'm gonna say one thing.

1181
01:31:20,560 --> 01:31:24,890
你随意地送我一束现摘的花束
When you casually gift me an impromptu bouquet of flowers,

1182
01:31:24,890 --> 01:31:26,090
-只会让我想到  -什么花
- that just makes me think... - What flowers?

1183
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:29,220
我该怎么还这份情
how and when am I supposed to pay that back?

1184
01:31:29,600 --> 01:31:31,520
你给我的一切都是在提醒我
Everything you give me is a reminder

1185
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,450
在这段关系中  我为你做的还不够
that I'm not doing enough for you in this relationship.

1186
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,100
你是说午餐的时候
What, at lunch?

1187
01:31:37,140 --> 01:31:39,220
我那是一时兴起
I picked those on a whim!

1188
01:31:39,570 --> 01:31:41,930
别跟我说你不是另有目的
Don't try to tell me that you had no ulterior motive.

1189
01:31:41,930 --> 01:31:43,850
-我能有什么目的  -你过生日
- Yeah! What motives do I have? - On your birthday?

1190
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:46,530
我什么都没送你
The day after I didn't get you something?

1191
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:49,910
你是认真的吗
Are you being serious?

1192
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,910
行吧
Okay, fine.

1193
01:31:54,160 --> 01:31:56,230
又要扮演受害者了
Play the wounded party again.

1194
01:31:57,210 --> 01:32:00,510
你是个自我否定的利他主义者  我是个偏执的混蛋
You're just a self-denying altruist, and I'm a paranoid dick.

1195
01:32:00,510 --> 01:32:02,120
你心中没有一丝一毫的算计
You don't have a conniving bone in your body.

1196
01:32:02,120 --> 01:32:05,600
-你觉得我在算计什么  -你就是在算计  丹妮
- What is it you imagine I'm conniving? - You are, Dani!

1197
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,780
你每次"一时兴起"  都让我觉得亏欠你了
I feel locked into your debt every time you do something "just because."

1198
01:32:08,780 --> 01:32:10,490
-我没觉得你亏欠我  -因为不存在"一时兴起"
- I don't keep you in my debt! - Because it's never "just because."

1199
01:32:10,490 --> 01:32:11,850
我只是想对你好
I was being kind.

1200
01:32:11,850 --> 01:32:13,220
我只是想对你好
I was being kind.

1201
01:32:13,220 --> 01:32:14,730
行吧  我是混蛋
Okay, fine. I'm the asshole.

1202
01:32:14,730 --> 01:32:17,160
-谁都不是混蛋  -显然我是
- Nobody's the asshole. - I clearly am.

1203
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:22,190
你无私地送我花  我还觉得被套牢了  操
You selflessly gave me flowers, and I feel trapped. Fuck!

1204
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,000
你不是要走吧
Are you actually gonna leave?

1205
01:32:24,350 --> 01:32:27,430
-我还有正事要干  -你就这么扔下我吗
- I'm supposed to be working here. - You're gonna leave me like this?

1206
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:29,940
克里斯蒂安
Christian!

1207
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:44,470
你有没有...不好意思
Do you... Sorry.

1208
01:32:44,630 --> 01:32:46,540
你有没有安眠药能给我
Do you have a sleeping pill I can take?

1209
01:32:46,540 --> 01:32:47,610
有  好的
Yeah, sure.

1210
01:32:47,610 --> 01:32:48,880
谢了
Thanks.

1211
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:16,740
你会吵醒她的
You're gonna wake her.

1212
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:20,430
佩尔
Pelle.

1213
01:36:35,770 --> 01:36:37,170
你在做什么
What'cha doin'?

1214
01:36:38,690 --> 01:36:40,410
打理下花园
Just working in the garden.

1215
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,280
伙计
Hey, man.

1216
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:49,250
有消息了吗
Any word?

1217
01:36:50,100 --> 01:36:51,840
他们说你可以写
Yeah, they said you can do it.

1218
01:36:51,860 --> 01:36:54,500
只要你不提及任何名字
As long as you absolutely don't use any names.

1219
01:36:54,500 --> 01:36:56,960
-好的  -也不能暗示任何地点
- Okay. - Or the location is never even hinted at.

1220
01:36:56,960 --> 01:36:59,780
-好的  -还有你必须签一份保证书
- Okay. - And you'll have to sign an agreement to that.

1221
01:37:01,010 --> 01:37:02,880
而且你要和克里斯蒂安平分
And you're splitting it with Christian

1222
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:04,820
因为是他先找我的
because he came to me first.

1223
01:37:05,810 --> 01:37:08,230
这...我们会想办法的
Well, that's... We'll... We'll figure that out.

1224
01:37:08,230 --> 01:37:09,780
我要去方便一下
I gotta go take a leak.

1225
01:37:10,720 --> 01:37:12,210
我能问你个事吗
Here, can I ask you something?

1226
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:13,340
说
Yeah.

1227
01:37:13,410 --> 01:37:16,410
你知道这是什么吗
Do you know what this is?

1228
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:19,640
我在克里斯蒂安的床下找到的
I found it under Christian's bed.

1229
01:37:21,450 --> 01:37:24,750
这是爱情卢恩  施展爱情魔咒的
That's a love rune. Casts a love spell.

1230
01:37:24,970 --> 01:37:26,950
-爱情卢恩  -嗯
- A love rune. - Yeah.

1231
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:29,840
-在克里斯蒂安床下  -是的
- Under Christian's bed? - Yeah, yeah.

1232
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:33,710
怎么样了
What's going on?

1233
01:37:34,770 --> 01:37:36,570
长老说你可以写论文
The elders said you can do your thesis

1234
01:37:36,570 --> 01:37:39,410
只要别提及真实的名字或地点
as long as you don't use the actual names or location.

1235
01:37:39,970 --> 01:37:41,080
真的吗
Are you serious?

1236
01:37:41,080 --> 01:37:42,230
真的
Yeah.

1237
01:37:42,830 --> 01:37:45,300
天呐  谢谢你
Oh, my God, thank you, man.

1238
01:37:45,540 --> 01:37:47,790
真是天大的好消息  谢谢你

1240
01:37:49,180 --> 01:37:51,740

Yeah, I already told him I'm totally fine with that.

1241
01:37:52,030 --> 01:37:52,940
好吧
Okay.

1242

Well, I think my sister

1243
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:56,140
玛雅喜欢上你了
Maja has taken a liking to you.

1244
01:37:57,410 --> 01:37:58,680

Yeah?

1245
01:37:59,550 --> 01:38:00,820
红头发那个
The red head?

1246
01:38:01,450 --> 01:38:05,030
事实上  她去年刚到默许年龄
Actually, she just got the byxmyndig last year.

1247
01:38:06,440 --> 01:38:09,150
基本上就是说  到了...
It basically means that, uh, you are...

1248
01:38:09,150 --> 01:38:12,700
到了可以做爱的年纪  脱裤许可年龄
You are allowed to have sex. Pants license.

{\pos(192.3,227)}你在干什么  你个蠢货  滚开

1252
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:25,990
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}把你恶心的老二收起来

1253
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:25,910
{\an8}什么  好吧  冷静  冷静
What? Okay, relax. Relax!

1254
01:38:25,910 --> 01:38:27,220
{\an8}我做什么了
What did I do?

1255
01:38:26,490 --> 01:38:30,810
{\pos(192.3,227)}这是我们的祖先  你在亵渎我的族人

1256
01:38:27,830 --> 01:38:30,840
{\an8}-佩尔  怎么回事  -怎么了  怎么了
- Pelle, what is going on? - What happened? What happened?

1257
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:34,790
{\pos(192.3,227)}你的傻逼美国朋友  他亵渎了颠倒树

1258
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:36,190
{\an8}我做什么了  我做什么了
What did I do? What did I do?

1259
01:38:38,070 --> 01:38:39,690
{\an8}老兄  行了
Dude! Okay!

1260
01:38:38,980 --> 01:38:40,440
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你没看到他干了什么吗

1261
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:42,530
{\an8}你亵渎了祖先树
You pissed on the ancestral tree.

1262
01:38:42,530 --> 01:38:44,030
-这棵树  那又怎样  -是的  是的
- The tree... So what? - Yes, yes.

1263
01:38:44,030 --> 01:38:44,950
{\an8}"那又怎样"
"So what?"

1264
01:38:44,950 --> 01:38:45,920
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你没听见他说了什么吗

1265
01:38:45,770 --> 01:38:47,510
{\an8}-我不知道  -不  这...
- I didn't know. - No, it's...

1266
01:38:47,510 --> 01:38:50,080
那棵树连结着我们所有的逝者
That tree is tied to all of our dead.

1267
01:38:50,390 --> 01:38:52,020
那只是一桩枯木
It's a dead tree, though.

1268
01:38:52,050 --> 01:38:53,800
-枯死了  -我知道
- It's dead. - Yeah, yeah, I know.

1269
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:54,970
但它对我们很重要
But it's important to us.

1270
01:38:54,970 --> 01:38:57,470
我尿急  我又不知道这是特别的树
I just had to pee. I didn't know it was special.

1271
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:58,270
我明白
No, I know.

1272
01:38:58,270 --> 01:39:00,440
我明白你不知道  但是...
We know that you didn't know that, but it's just...

1273
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:01,460
我怎么会知道
Well, how was I supposed to know...

1274
01:39:01,470 --> 01:39:03,530
你不会在墓碑上撒尿吧
You wouldn't pee on a gravestone, right?

1275
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:05,400
显然不会  但是...
Obviously not, but...

1276
01:39:06,790 --> 01:39:08,140
操  这...
Fuck! I mean...

1277
01:39:08,580 --> 01:39:09,970
你对他做了什么
What did you do to him?

1278
01:39:09,970 --> 01:39:12,630
我都不知道我在为什么道歉  我要道歉吗
I don't know what I'm apologizing for... Do I apologize?

1279
01:39:13,560 --> 01:39:15,170
之后再道歉
Apologize later.

1280
01:39:16,110 --> 01:39:18,110
-好了  -靠  你好
- Okay. - Oh, shit. Hi.

1281
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:23,310
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}告诉他没关系  他不知道

1282
01:39:23,580 --> 01:39:24,580
好的
Okay.

1283
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:26,710
-好的  -什么鬼
- Okay. - What the fuck!

1284
01:39:26,750 --> 01:39:28,590
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我去跟乌尔夫老爹谈

1285
01:39:32,230 --> 01:39:33,610
她说了什么
What did she say?

1286
01:39:34,300 --> 01:39:36,730
她说不会有事的
She said it's gonna be okay,

1287
01:39:36,730 --> 01:39:40,000
她会跟乌尔夫谈  为这个错误道歉
and she'll talk to Ulf and apologize for the mistake.

1288
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:42,730
真的吗  她还说了什么
Seriously? What else did she say?

1289
01:39:57,540 --> 01:39:59,180
你睡得好吗
You get some good sleep?

1290
01:40:01,390 --> 01:40:02,680
那就好
Good.

1291
01:40:03,410 --> 01:40:04,890
那边出什么事了
What happened over there?

1292
01:40:05,730 --> 01:40:07,810
马克...他...
Mark's... just...

1293
01:40:23,340 --> 01:40:25,140
昨晚的事我很抱歉
I'm sorry about last night.

1294
01:40:25,700 --> 01:40:27,080
你感觉怎么样
How are you feeling?

1295
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:33,230
我不想跟你吵架  克里斯蒂安
I don't want us to be fighting, Christian.

1296
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:35,360
好吧
Well...

1297
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:37,770
我也不想
Me neither.

1298
01:41:11,820 --> 01:41:12,850
真的很高兴认识你
It was really nice to meet you.

1299
01:41:12,850 --> 01:41:15,240
很抱歉  我们要走了
I'm so sorry. We're actually leaving.

1300
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:16,500
什么
What?

1301
01:41:16,870 --> 01:41:18,680
-嗯  -康妮
- Yeah. - Connie.

1302
01:41:18,680 --> 01:41:20,600
西蒙跟一个村民去开卡车了
Simon is getting the truck with one of them now.

1303
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,870
-康妮  -没出什么事吧
- Connie. - Is everything okay?

1304
01:41:24,030 --> 01:41:25,340
康妮
Connie.

1305
01:41:26,230 --> 01:41:27,600
找到你了
Oh, there.

1306
01:41:28,250 --> 01:41:30,820
西蒙  他要我告诉你
Simon, he told me to tell you

1307
01:41:31,140 --> 01:41:33,730
扬开车送他去火车站了
that, uh, Jan drove him to the train station.

1308
01:41:33,730 --> 01:41:36,160
送完西蒙后
And after, uh, Simon gets dropped off,

1309
01:41:36,160 --> 01:41:38,550
他再回来送你
he's sending the truck back for you.

1310
01:41:38,550 --> 01:41:39,790
什么
What?

1311
01:41:40,080 --> 01:41:42,580
你去火车站和他汇合
You will meet him, uh, there.

1312
01:41:42,890 --> 01:41:44,250
不
No.

1313
01:41:44,550 --> 01:41:45,830
他为什么不等我一起走
Why would he just go without me?

1314
01:41:45,830 --> 01:41:47,680
他不会那么做的
He... He wouldn't do that.

1315
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,320
车里只能坐下两个人
Well, the truck only had room for two.

1316
01:41:50,320 --> 01:41:51,580
所以
So...

1317
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:54,560
什么意思
What does that mean?

1318
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:56,300
这根本说不通
That doesn't even make any sense.

1319
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:57,840
他会跟我说一声的
He would have told me.

1320
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:00,070
今天唯一一趟火车90分钟后就要发车了
Today's only train leaves in 90 minutes.

1321
01:42:00,070 --> 01:42:02,900
往返火车站大约需要35分钟
It takes about 35 minutes to go there and back.

1322
01:42:02,900 --> 01:42:04,730
所以他们不想浪费时间
So they didn't want to waste time.

1323
01:42:05,730 --> 01:42:07,400
我可以坐在他腿上
So I could have sat on his lap.

1324
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:08,710
嗯  我也觉得可以
Yes, I imagined that, too,

1325
01:42:08,710 --> 01:42:12,340
但是  我们不能违反交通法规
but, you know, we... We don't break traffic laws.

1326
01:42:12,340 --> 01:42:13,210
好吗
Okay?

1327
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:18,350
他们就这么走了  丢下我一个人
So they've just gone. They've left me just now.

1328
01:42:18,360 --> 01:42:21,160
康妮  车里坐不下
Now, Connie. There was no room in the truck.

1329
01:42:21,170 --> 01:42:24,770
再说了  车会回来接你的
Yet, it is coming right back for you. Yeah.

1330
01:42:27,990 --> 01:42:29,380
太扯了
This is bullshit.

1331
01:42:39,190 --> 01:42:41,030
马上就要吃午饭了
Okay, lunch in a bit.

1332
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:04,090
这里是怎么分配工作或职位的
And how are jobs or roles assigned?

1333
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:06,850
根据我们小时候表现出来的特征
That's based on traits we show as kids.

1334
01:43:07,850 --> 01:43:11,240
例如  他分配到的是保护
For example, he was assigned to protect.

1335
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:13,710
所以他的朝圣之旅是去当医生
So he made his pilgrimage as doctor.

1336
01:43:15,310 --> 01:43:16,880
他没事吧
Is he gonna be okay?

1337
01:43:17,470 --> 01:43:18,550
你看他
I mean...

1338
01:43:19,410 --> 01:43:22,520
嗯  他是个很敏感的人
Yeah, he's a very sensitive guy.

1339
01:43:22,780 --> 01:43:24,370
这周对他来说很重要
It's a big week for him.

1340
01:43:26,490 --> 01:43:27,440
抱歉
Sorry.

1341
01:43:29,580 --> 01:43:31,470
西蒙扔下康妮自己走了
Simon left without Connie.

1342
01:43:32,380 --> 01:43:34,330
-天呐  真的吗  -嗯
- Jesus, really? - Yeah.

1343
01:43:34,330 --> 01:43:35,900
太混蛋了
What a dick move.

1344
01:43:36,910 --> 01:43:39,080
-她还好吗  -不好
- Is she okay? - Uh, no.

1345
01:43:39,080 --> 01:43:40,280
-她刚知道  -她有说原因吗
- She just got told. - Did she say why?

1346
01:43:40,280 --> 01:43:41,420
没有
No, no.

1347
01:43:42,490 --> 01:43:43,980
真糟心
That sucks.

1348
01:43:46,580 --> 01:43:49,190
其实我还想问问男女关系方面
On the... On the subject of couples actually, um...

1349
01:43:50,900 --> 01:43:53,790
这里有乱伦的问题吗
Is there ever an issue here with incest?

1350
01:43:55,610 --> 01:43:58,670
抱歉  你也知道  这么小的社群
Sorry, I mean, you know, small communities.

1351
01:43:59,230 --> 01:44:02,800
我们的血统传承得非常好
Well, the bloodlines are very well-preserved.

1352
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:05,180
所以结合必须获得长老的认可
So, uh, the elders must approve mates.

1353
01:44:05,410 --> 01:44:07,790
有时表亲也会结合
Cousins can sometimes mate.

1354
01:44:07,790 --> 01:44:11,200
但我们尊重他们对近亲婚配的禁忌
But we do respect their incest taboo.

1355
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:16,910
所以我们经常需要邀请外来者
So we often need to invite outside people.

1356
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,100
打扰一下
Excuse me.

1357
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:41,300
你愿意来帮忙吗
Would you like to help join us?

1358
01:44:45,500 --> 01:44:47,320
-好啊  -来吧
- Sure, yeah. - Come.

1359
01:44:48,270 --> 01:44:50,650
你知不知道
Do you... Do you know, um...

1360
01:44:51,230 --> 01:44:53,210
你见过西蒙吗
Have you seen Simon anywhere?

1361
01:44:53,470 --> 01:44:55,900
见过  有人送他去火车站了
Yes. He was driven to the station.

1362
01:44:56,150 --> 01:44:57,530
你没有跟他告别吗
Did you not say goodbye?

1363
01:44:57,790 --> 01:44:59,320
没  我没有
No. No, I didn't.

1364
01:44:59,320 --> 01:45:02,500
不过不要紧  没事
But, uh, that's okay, that's okay.

1365
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:10,310
这是在做什么
What are we making here?

1366
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:11,810
肉饼
Meat tarts!

1367
01:45:14,630 --> 01:45:15,640
谢谢
Thank you.

1368
01:45:18,180 --> 01:45:20,120
她说你真漂亮
She said you're so beautiful.

1369
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:22,640
谢谢
Thank you.

1370
01:45:23,550 --> 01:45:25,170
她也很漂亮
She's so beautiful.

1371
01:45:44,330 --> 01:45:48,180
我们称之为情感乐谱
We describe it like emotional sheet music.

1372
01:45:48,200 --> 01:45:49,340
上面写了什么
What does it say?

1373
01:45:49,660 --> 01:45:52,250
每个卢恩字母
Well, each runic letter

1374
01:45:52,250 --> 01:45:55,300
都代表十六个影响中的一个
stands for one of the 16 affects,

1375
01:45:55,300 --> 01:45:58,790
从最神圣到最邪恶
which are graded from most holy to most unholy.

1376
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:02,070
举个例子  这个代表悲伤
This one, for example, is about grief.

1377
01:46:02,610 --> 01:46:04,950
你可以看到最后
You can see at the end, however,

1378
01:46:04,950 --> 01:46:07,290
都是空白页
we have blank pages.

1379
01:46:07,950 --> 01:46:12,990
这是因为《鲁比拉达》是一本不断在更新的著作
This is because the Rubi Radr is a work forever in progress.

1380
01:46:12,990 --> 01:46:14,070
永远在进化
Forever evolving.

1381
01:46:14,070 --> 01:46:17,250
我们有成百上千本这样的书
We have many, many hundreds of these.

1382
01:46:18,150 --> 01:46:22,110
谁来决定书的补充内容呢
And who decides what gets added?

1383
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:26,850
这个版本是由鲁宾撰写的
Well, uh, this iteration is being written by Rubin.

1384
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:32,940
那个残疾人吗
The disabled?

1385
01:46:33,010 --> 01:46:34,650
从出生起
Since birth.

1386
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:39,240
他画  我们长老翻译
He draws and we, the elders, interpret.

1387
01:46:40,560 --> 01:46:41,860
你看  乔希
You see, Josh,

1388
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:45,120
鲁宾不受普通认知的干扰
Rubin is unclouded by normal cognition.

1389
01:46:45,390 --> 01:46:48,460
这令他的心能包罗万象
It makes him open for the source.

1390
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:55,390
鲁宾死后会怎样
What happens when Rubin dies?

1391
01:46:55,390 --> 01:46:58,410
你们就干等着下一个
Do you just wait for a baby that is...

1392
01:47:00,170 --> 01:47:01,460
不受干扰的孩子降生吗
not clouded?

1393
01:47:01,460 --> 01:47:03,010
不  不  不
No, no, no.

1394
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:06,540
鲁宾是近亲结合的后代
Rubin was a product of inbreeding.

1395
01:47:06,740 --> 01:47:07,890
我们所有先知
All of our Oracles

1396
01:47:07,900 --> 01:47:11,020
都是有意的近亲结合的后代
are deliberate products of inbreeding.

1397
01:47:14,340 --> 01:47:15,950
我能拍张照片吗
Can I take a photograph?

1398
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:18,130
什么
What?

1399
01:47:18,780 --> 01:47:20,400
拍张照片
A photograph?

1400
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:23,860
-不行  绝对不行  -好的  抱歉
- No. Absolutely not. - Okay, sorry.

1401
01:47:23,960 --> 01:47:25,840
绝对不行
Absolutely not.

1402
01:47:51,490 --> 01:47:53,070
操  是她
Fuck, yep, that's her.

1403
01:48:09,950 --> 01:48:11,460
真好  她走了
Great. She's walking away.

1404
01:48:12,090 --> 01:48:13,740
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}晚饭准备好了

1405
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,580
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}该吃晚饭了

1406
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:32,870
谢谢
Thank you.

1407
01:48:40,050 --> 01:48:40,970
谢谢
Thanks.

1408
01:48:41,240 --> 01:48:42,200
谢谢
Tack.

1409
01:48:42,800 --> 01:48:43,740
谢谢
Thanks.

1410
01:48:49,960 --> 01:48:51,650
有人见到康妮了吗
Has anyone seen Connie?

1411
01:48:53,790 --> 01:48:55,570
马克之前好像见过她
I think Mark saw her earlier.

1412
01:48:56,410 --> 01:48:57,520
之前我看到她跑得像是
I'm sure I saw her trying out

1413
01:48:57,520 --> 01:48:59,480
参加奥运会选拔赛
for the sprinting Olympics earlier.

1414
01:48:59,480 --> 01:49:00,370
什么  在哪
What? Where?

1415
01:49:00,370 --> 01:49:02,550
抱歉打断  我知道发生了什么
Sorry, but I can say what happened.

1416
01:49:02,770 --> 01:49:04,040
她男友用火车站的座机
Her boyfriend called the landline

1417
01:49:04,040 --> 01:49:06,340
打来电话  让康妮冷静下来了
from the train station and calmed Connie down.

1418
01:49:06,750 --> 01:49:09,070
然后她向我们道歉  我送她去和他汇合了
Then she begged our pardon and I drove her to meet him.

1419
01:49:12,700 --> 01:49:14,550
好的  这样我就放心了
Okay, well, that's a relief.

1420
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:16,570
为什么西蒙要扔下她自己走
Why would Simon leave without her?

1421
01:49:17,950 --> 01:49:19,910
肯定只是沟通出现了误会
I'm sure it was just a miscommunication.

1422
01:49:37,240 --> 01:49:39,280
我看得出你可能也会这么做
I could see you possibly doing that.

1423
01:49:44,580 --> 01:49:45,940
你这话什么意思
What the hell does that mean?

1424
01:49:52,240 --> 01:49:53,340
没什么
Never mind.

1425
01:50:00,460 --> 01:50:03,410
有人还在为他们的祖先树耿耿于怀
Someone's still sore about their ancestral tree.

1426
01:50:09,210 --> 01:50:10,930
老兄  他会杀了我吗
Dude, is he going to kill me?

1427
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:16,330
你了解到关于《鲁比拉达》的事了吗
Did you learn anything about the Rubi Radr?

1428
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:24,180
怎么  你又想合作了
So now you wanna collaborate?

1429
01:50:24,180 --> 01:50:25,750
谢谢你了
Okay, thank you.

1430
01:50:25,830 --> 01:50:26,940
-我知道有个长老  -谢谢
- I know that one elder... - Thank you.

1431
01:50:26,940 --> 01:50:27,620
让你看了一眼
gave you a glimpse of it.

1432
01:50:27,620 --> 01:50:29,330
谢谢  我不该提起的
Thank you. Sorry I brought it up.

1433
01:50:53,560 --> 01:50:56,160
天啊  老兄  搞什么
Oh, my God, dude. What the fuck?

1434
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:58,410
-那是...  -那是什么
- Is that... - What is that?

1435
01:50:58,410 --> 01:51:00,350
那是阴毛吗
Is that a fucking pube?

1436
01:51:00,610 --> 01:51:01,450
只是根头发
It's just a hair.

1437
01:51:01,450 --> 01:51:03,280
是阴部的头发吧
Yeah, a pubic hair.

1438
01:51:03,570 --> 01:51:05,360
老兄  冷静
Dude, calm down.

1439
01:51:05,360 --> 01:51:06,460
你有什么好尴尬的
Why are you embarrassed?

1440
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:09,680
有毛的饼又不是你发的
You're not the one giving out hair pies.

1441
01:51:26,640 --> 01:51:29,850
{\an8}卢恩字母组合
情感乐谱

1442
01:51:29,180 --> 01:51:31,800
老天  他还在盯着我看
Jesus Christ. He's still fucking lookin' at me.

1443
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:34,680
你能跟我来吗
You'll come with me?

1444
01:51:35,870 --> 01:51:37,540
-什么  -来吗
- What? - You'll come?

1445
01:51:38,760 --> 01:51:39,830
我带你看
I'll show you.

1446
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:41,720
好  行
Okay, sure.

1447
01:51:41,720 --> 01:51:44,040
-好吗  -行  好
- Yeah? - Yeah, great.

1448
01:51:46,090 --> 01:51:48,410
我待会回来  她好像要带我看
I'll be back. I guess she's gonna show me.

1449
01:52:11,550 --> 01:52:13,550
能再给我一片安眠药吗
Can I borrow another sleeping pill?

1450
01:52:13,560 --> 01:52:15,290
-好  没问题  -谢了
- Yeah, sure, yeah. - Thanks.

1451
01:52:17,990 --> 01:52:18,870
谢谢
Thank you.

1452
01:54:08,630 --> 01:54:10,440
搞什么  马克
What the fuck, Mark?

1453
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,130
你在搞什么鬼  关上门
What the fuck are you doing? Close the door,

1454
01:54:12,130 --> 01:54:14,030
我们不该进这里的
we're not supposed to be in here.

1455
01:55:11,240 --> 01:55:13,190
你说马克还和那个女孩在一起吗
Do you think Mark's still up with that girl?

1456
01:55:14,350 --> 01:55:15,910
没什么好惊讶的
I wouldn't be surprised.

1457
01:55:19,030 --> 01:55:20,470
不过乔希呢
What about Josh though?

1458
01:55:20,470 --> 01:55:22,690
我真的不太关心
I'm honestly not too concerned.

1459
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:27,230
我们
We...

1460
01:55:28,390 --> 01:55:31,690
有一件遗憾的事要宣布
have something regretful to announce.

1461
01:55:31,950 --> 01:55:35,580
今天早上我们发现
This morning the 19th Book of Rubi Radr

1462
01:55:35,580 --> 01:55:37,990
第十九卷《鲁比拉达》从神庙失踪了
was found missing from the Temple.

1463
01:55:39,360 --> 01:55:42,210
我们不想指责谁
We don't want to point fingers,

1464
01:55:42,220 --> 01:55:44,540
不过我们恳请拿走它的人
yet, we kindly ask that whoever took it

1465
01:55:44,540 --> 01:55:46,700
把它放回原处
to return it to its original place.

1466
01:55:46,700 --> 01:55:48,540
你可以把它放回神庙
You can leave it in the Temple,

1467
01:55:48,610 --> 01:55:51,360
那里不会有人看守
which will be left unguarded, unwatched.

1468
01:55:51,490 --> 01:55:54,550
不会有人知道是你拿走的
Nobody needs to know it was you.

1469
01:56:07,260 --> 01:56:08,880
你们的朋友乔希在哪
Where is your friend, Josh?

1470
01:56:08,880 --> 01:56:12,340
他不见了  我们不知道他在哪
I know. We have no idea.

1471
01:56:12,940 --> 01:56:14,810
他和你们的另一位朋友
He and your other friend,

1472
01:56:15,130 --> 01:56:17,860
他们都在同一天消失了
they both disappears the same day.

1473
01:56:19,620 --> 01:56:21,230
-这情况你们明白吧  -是的  很显然
- You see how it looks? - Yes, obviously.

1474
01:56:21,230 --> 01:56:23,410
但我对你们发誓我们完全不知情
But I swear to you we're in the dark on this.

1475
01:56:23,410 --> 01:56:25,290
我们和你们一样疑惑
We're just as confused as you are.

1476
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:29,320
我们确实看到马克昨晚和那个女孩走了
We did see Mark go off with that girl last night.

1477
01:56:30,150 --> 01:56:32,070
-哪个女孩  -英格
- What girl? - Inge.

1478
01:56:32,230 --> 01:56:33,880
是的  但马克不会做这种事
Yeah, but Mark wouldn't have done this.

1479
01:56:33,880 --> 01:56:35,450
不过乔希
Josh on the other hand,

1480
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:36,900
他和我们一起上床睡觉
he came to bed with us

1481
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:38,290
我们醒来时他就不见了
and when we woke up, he was gone.

1482
01:56:38,290 --> 01:56:41,140
如果真是他拿的  我恳求你们理解
And if he did take that book, I just pray you understand

1483
01:56:41,150 --> 01:56:43,430
我们不算他的朋友
we don't associate as friends of his

1484
01:56:43,430 --> 01:56:45,500
也不是合作者之类的
or collaborators or anything.

1485
01:56:45,500 --> 01:56:47,950
以任何方式或形式与此事有任何联系
We would just be so embarrassed to be connected to this

1486
01:56:47,960 --> 01:56:49,890
我们都会很难堪
in any way, shape or form.

1487
01:56:51,470 --> 01:56:54,430
希望书会被归还
Let's hope it gets returned.

1488
01:56:54,820 --> 01:56:55,930
我也希望
I hope so too.

1489
01:56:55,940 --> 01:56:57,710
我感觉有责任
I feel responsible.

1490
01:56:58,000 --> 01:57:00,920
你和奥德可以去找他们
Well, you and Odd, you can go looking for them.

1491
01:57:00,930 --> 01:57:03,450
-好的  -或许你能弥补
- Yes. - Maybe you can redeem this.

1492
01:57:04,970 --> 01:57:08,770
你和女人们去进行今天的活动
You are going with the women for the day's activity.

1493
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:13,360
希芙要你去她家见她
And Siv wants to see you in her house.

1494
01:57:20,860 --> 01:57:21,810
你没问题吧
You okay?

1495
01:57:23,100 --> 01:57:26,470
好  好的
Okay. Okay.

1496
01:58:08,160 --> 01:58:09,670
这是重头戏
This is the big one.

1497
01:58:10,650 --> 01:58:12,650
好的  谢谢
Okay. Thank you.

1498
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:17,720
直视她的双眼
Look into her eyes.

1499
01:58:20,340 --> 01:58:22,590
我能问问这到底是什么吗
Can I ask what this is exactly?

1500
01:58:23,120 --> 01:58:26,670
这是...比赛专用的茶
It's... tea for the competition.

1501
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,530
然后你把杯子放这里
And then you, glass here.

1502
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:38,880
然后我们喝掉
And then we drink it.

1503
01:58:39,190 --> 01:58:40,690
-好吗  -好的
- Okay? - Okay.

1504
01:58:41,710 --> 01:58:42,600
好的
Okay.

1505
01:58:51,060 --> 01:58:53,010
-天呐  -开始了
- Oh, God. - Here we go!

1506
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:42,070
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}很久以前  在这里

1507
01:59:43,370 --> 01:59:48,670
{\pos(192.3,227)}黑暗之君将哈加的年轻人引至草地  诱惑他们跳舞

1512
02:01:50,360 --> 02:01:51,770
首先我要说
First thing I just have to say,

1513
02:01:51,770 --> 02:01:54,200
我不知道乔希在哪
I have no idea where Josh is.

1514
02:01:54,210 --> 02:01:56,440
我以我母亲的性命发誓
And I can swear to that on my mother's life.

1515
02:01:56,440 --> 02:01:58,460
你觉得玛雅怎么样
How do you feel about Maja?

1516
02:02:03,050 --> 02:02:04,430
玛雅
About Maja?

1517
02:02:10,670 --> 02:02:12,740
我觉得她怎么样  什么意思
How do I feel about her how?

1518
02:02:12,890 --> 02:02:15,220
长老们认可你和她结合
You have been approved to mate with her.

1519
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:19,230
占星显示你是良配
You're an ideal astrological match.

1520
02:02:19,960 --> 02:02:22,370
她对你寄予厚望
And she has fixed her hopes on you.

1521
02:02:26,090 --> 02:02:28,270
我不太明白你的意思
I'm not sure I understand what you mean.

1522
02:02:30,470 --> 02:02:32,790
我都没跟她说过话
I haven't even spoken to her.

1523
02:02:33,660 --> 02:02:35,750
你来之前她就相中你了
She fixed on you before you came.

1524
02:02:36,130 --> 02:02:38,530
佩尔给她看了一张照片
Pelle showed her a photo.

1525
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:48,060
我是和女友一起来的
I'm here with someone.

1526
02:02:48,670 --> 02:02:50,020
丹妮是我女友
I'm here with Dani.

1527
02:02:50,160 --> 02:02:51,760
丹妮不会知道的
Dani will not know.

1528
02:02:53,290 --> 02:02:55,670
我不是想让你们结婚
I am not proposing marriage.

1529
02:02:56,580 --> 02:02:58,690
你不会获得认可的
You wouldn't be approved for that.

1530
02:03:01,290 --> 02:03:03,830
那你问的是什么意思
Okay, so what is it you're asking?

1531
02:03:05,070 --> 02:03:08,640
我是问你是否愿意和玛雅结合
I'm asking if you care to mate with Maja.

1532
02:03:08,800 --> 02:03:10,730
仅限一夜
It's a one-night offer.

1533
02:03:18,670 --> 02:03:21,510
我好像吃了她的一根阴毛
I think I ate one of her pubic hairs.

1534
02:03:21,510 --> 02:03:23,320
听起来没什么问题
Sounds probably right.

1535
02:03:25,470 --> 02:03:27,720
从学术的角度来看
From an academic perspective...

1536
02:03:27,730 --> 02:03:32,630
这也能提供了解我们的性仪式的独特视角
It would also provide a unique glimpse into our sexual rites.

1537
02:03:38,930 --> 02:03:42,260
我不参与就不能获得独特视角吗
Can I not have a unique glimpse without participating?

1538
02:04:25,650 --> 02:04:26,650
停
Stop!

1539
02:04:33,600 --> 02:04:34,810
待在这里
Stay here.

1540
02:04:35,650 --> 02:04:36,700
准备好了吗
Are you ready?

1541
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,230
-我们在做什么  -你会明白的
- What are we doing? - You'll see.

1542
02:05:49,590 --> 02:05:50,660
停
Stop!

1543
02:05:55,450 --> 02:05:58,250
-你太棒了  -什么意思
- You're so good! - What does that mean?

1544
02:05:58,260 --> 02:05:59,110
八强  八强
Eight! Eight!

1545
02:05:59,110 --> 02:06:00,600
-我们是八强  -什么
- We're now eight left! - What?

1546
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:25,770
克里斯蒂安
Christian?

1547
02:06:26,720 --> 02:06:27,670
给你的
For you.

1548
02:06:30,010 --> 02:06:31,080
谢谢
Thanks.

1549
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:33,510
这是什么
What is it?

1550
02:06:34,100 --> 02:06:35,630
这是...抱歉
It's... Sorry.

1551
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:42,760
有特殊效果的泉水
Spring water with special properties.

1552
02:06:45,950 --> 02:06:46,810
好吧
Okay.

1553
02:06:47,120 --> 02:06:49,560
-好的  -有什么作用
- Okay. - What does it do?

1554
02:06:51,480 --> 02:06:55,420
它...能让你卸下防备
It... it breaks down your defenses

1555
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:59,390
使你容易接受影响
and opens you for the influence.

1556
02:07:00,380 --> 02:07:01,300
好吧
Okay.

1557
02:07:03,000 --> 02:07:03,930
谢谢
Thanks.

1558
02:07:05,060 --> 02:07:06,320
不客气
You're welcome.

1559
02:07:07,580 --> 02:07:08,510
我又想了一下
You know what?

1560
02:07:09,700 --> 02:07:11,520
我担心会有不好的体验
I'm worried I'll have a bad trip.

1561
02:07:11,600 --> 02:07:14,430
不不  不会的  相信我
No, no. You won't. You won't. Trust me.

1562
02:07:38,150 --> 02:07:39,360
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}停

1563
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:42,680
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}反向

1564
02:07:46,890 --> 02:07:47,700
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}停

1565

1566

{\pos(192.3,245.2)}停

1567
02:08:06,960 --> 02:08:07,980
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}开始

1568
02:08:58,440 --> 02:09:01,260
-我不会说瑞典语  -什么
- I don't speak Swedish. - What?

1569
02:09:05,130 --> 02:09:06,510
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你想说瑞典语吗

1570
02:09:07,040 --> 02:09:08,630
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我想说吗

1571
02:09:08,630 --> 02:09:10,260
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}你想说

1572
02:09:12,240 --> 02:09:14,270
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我们在对话

1573
02:09:14,270 --> 02:09:15,640
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我能听懂

1574
02:09:15,640 --> 02:09:18,870
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我们互相理解

1575
02:09:19,570 --> 02:09:23,060
{\pos(192.3,227)}我们不需要用语言交流  舞蹈就够了

1576
02:09:29,410 --> 02:09:31,620
什么  什么
What? What?

1577
02:09:40,520 --> 02:09:41,800
什么情况
What's happening?

1578
02:09:44,030 --> 02:09:47,550
你是我们的五月女王
You are our May Queen.

1579
02:09:48,050 --> 02:09:49,460
-我吗  -是的
- Me? - Yes!

1580
02:09:49,460 --> 02:09:51,320
-为什么  -你赢了
- Why? - You won!

1581
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:53,980
那是什么意思
What does that mean?

1582
02:09:54,020 --> 02:09:56,010
什么  天啊
What? Oh, my god.

1583
02:10:45,240 --> 02:10:47,620
妈  妈
Mom? Mom?

1584
02:10:49,290 --> 02:10:52,570
天呐  丹妮  五月女王
Oh, my God, Dani! May Queen!

1585
02:13:30,070 --> 02:13:30,990
吃鲱鱼吗
Herring?

1586
02:13:31,900 --> 02:13:33,130
为什么
What for?

1587
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:36,730
这是传统  为了好运
It's tradition. For good luck.

1588
02:13:36,730 --> 02:13:37,590
是的
Yeah.

1589
02:13:38,450 --> 02:13:41,180
-什么  -你必须整个吞下去
- What? - And you must eat it whole.

1590
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:44,100
-但是先吃鱼尾  -不不不
- But the tails go in first. - No, no, no!

1591

1592
02:13:45,950 --> 02:13:47,670
你必须试试

很棒的尝试
Very good try.

1594
02:14:03,260 --> 02:14:04,370
打扰一下
Excuse me...

1595
02:14:06,190 --> 02:14:07,390
这是什么情况
What's going on?

1596
02:14:16,360 --> 02:14:18,030
你为什么要这么做
Why did you do that?

1597
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:27,140
敬我们的五月女王
To our May Queen!

1598
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:30,160
欢迎  干杯
Välkommen! Skål!

干杯
Skål!

1600
02:14:44,240 --> 02:14:46,220
你现在是我们的家人了  对吗

1601
02:14:46,500 --> 02:14:48,700
没错  你是我们的家人了

1602
02:14:49,000 --> 02:14:50,640
就像姐妹
Like sisters.

1603
02:16:24,860 --> 02:16:27,450
现在  按照传统  五月女王该去
Now, it's traditional for the May Queen

1604
02:16:27,450 --> 02:16:30,350
祝福我们的庄稼和牲畜了
to bless our crops and livestock.

1605
02:16:31,700 --> 02:16:35,670
看到你刚刚从咸鲱鱼继承的运气后
And after the luck you just inherited from that salt herring,

1606
02:16:35,670 --> 02:16:38,650
我们都应该受到双倍鼓舞
we should all be doubly encouraged.

1607
02:16:51,930 --> 02:16:53,630
克里斯蒂安能和我一起吗
Can Christian come with me?

1608
02:16:54,310 --> 02:16:55,210
不能
Nay.

1609
02:16:55,690 --> 02:16:57,380
女王必须独自乘坐
The Queen must ride alone.

1610
02:19:54,870 --> 02:19:56,140
跟我唱
Repeat after me.

1611
02:20:42,700 --> 02:20:43,900
吸气
Breathe in.

1612
02:20:47,040 --> 02:20:49,030
为你提升精力
For your vitality.

1613
02:25:16,940 --> 02:25:18,880
我们现在该去希芙家了
We shall go now to Siv's house.

1614
02:25:19,440 --> 02:25:20,420
这是做什么
What's this?

1615
02:25:20,690 --> 02:25:23,590
这是只有女王能参加的特殊会面
It is a special meeting, only for the Queens.

1616
02:25:23,780 --> 02:25:25,220
她会祝福你

1617
02:25:29,070 --> 02:25:29,970
那是做什么
What's that?

1618
02:25:30,410 --> 02:25:31,520
那不是我们该做的
That's not for us.

1619
02:25:37,420 --> 02:25:38,690
我觉得你不该去
I think you should not.

1620
02:27:27,900 --> 02:27:29,590
不  不  不
No, no, no.

1621

{\pos(192.3,245.2)}射进来

1623
02:29:31,750 --> 02:29:32,920
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}我能感觉到

1624
02:29:34,100 --> 02:29:35,570
{\pos(192.3,245.2)}感觉到孩子了

1625
02:32:33,540 --> 02:32:34,570
克里斯蒂安
Christian?

1626
02:32:36,630 --> 02:32:37,480
克里斯蒂安
Christian.

1627
02:32:43,340 --> 02:32:45,370
你好  你醒了啊
Hello, there you are.

1628
02:32:45,890 --> 02:32:46,740
听好了
Listen.

1629
02:32:47,390 --> 02:32:50,620
你不能说话  也不能动
You can't speak. You can't move.

1630
02:32:51,640 --> 02:32:52,750
明白吗
All right?

1631
02:32:53,810 --> 02:32:54,630
很好
Good.

1632
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:10,490
在今天互惠神明的这个日子
On this, the day of our deity of reciprocity,

1633
02:33:10,490 --> 02:33:13,750
我们聚在一起向我们珍贵的太阳

1634
02:33:13,750 --> 02:33:15,440
致以特别感谢

1635
02:33:15,960 --> 02:33:18,230
作为对我们父亲的献祭
As an offering to our father,

1636
02:33:18,500 --> 02:33:23,200
我们今天将交出九条人命

1637
02:33:24,010 --> 02:33:28,290
哈加索取  同时也付出
As Harga takes, so Harga also gives.

1638
02:33:28,590 --> 02:33:33,310
因此  对每一位献祭的新成员
Thus, for every new blood sacrificed,

1639
02:33:33,310 --> 02:33:36,960
我们将献上一位我们的人

1640
02:33:37,900 --> 02:33:41,090
也就是四位新成员

1641
02:33:41,730 --> 02:33:43,430
四位哈加人
Four from Harga.

1642
02:33:44,190 --> 02:33:47,180
还有一位将被女王选出

1643
02:33:47,700 --> 02:33:50,770
一共九位将死亡
Nine in all to die

1644
02:33:51,120 --> 02:33:54,690
并在伟大的循环中获得新生
and be reborn in the great cycle.

1645
02:33:55,790 --> 02:33:59,360
四位新成员已被奉上
The four new bloods have already been supplied.

1646
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:04,450
至于我们的人  已经有两位献身

还有两位自告奋勇

英格马和乌尔夫
Ingemar and Ulf.

1649
02:34:17,520 --> 02:34:20,960
你们从外界带来了祭品
You have brought outside offerings.

1650
02:34:21,230 --> 02:34:24,260
还自愿奉上自身

1651
02:34:25,230 --> 02:34:29,600
你们今天将与一切共达和谐

还有新的五月女王

1654
