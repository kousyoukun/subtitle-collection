1
00:01:12,615 --> 00:01:17,454
NARRATOR: In the beginning, God
created the heaven and the Earth.

2
00:01:17,746 --> 00:01:20,874
And the Earth was
without form, and void.

3
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,793
(EXPLOSIONS)

4
00:01:35,305 --> 00:01:38,141
This is the planet Earth,
newly born,

5
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,435
and cooling rapidly
from a temperature

6
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:43,354
of 6,000 degrees
to a few hundred

7
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:45,982
in less than
five billion years.

8
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:51,279
The heat rises, meets the
atmosphere, the clouds form,

9
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:56,367
and rain pours down upon the hardening
surface for countless centuries.

10
00:01:57,035 --> 00:02:02,791
The restless seas rise, find
boundaries, are contained.

11
00:02:03,792 --> 00:02:08,546
Now, in their warm depths,
the miracle of life begins.

12
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,174
In infinite variety,

13
00:02:11,257 --> 00:02:15,970
living things appear, and
change, and reach the land,

14
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:18,973
leaving a record
of their coming,

15
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:23,394
of their struggle to survive,
and of their eventual end.

16
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,856
The record of life is
written on the land,

17
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,734
where 15 million years later,

18
00:02:30,235 --> 00:02:33,029
in the upper reaches
of the Amazon,

19
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,907
man is still
trying to read it.

20
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,079
MAN: Tomas! Tomas! Tomas!

21
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,380
Please.

22
00:02:57,637 --> 00:02:59,222
LUIS: What that is,
Dr. Maia?

23
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:00,849
I don't know, Luis.

24
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:03,226
I have never seen
anything like this before.

25
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:05,520
It's important?

26
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:09,440
Yes, I think it is,
very important.

27
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:16,364
We will take one more picture.
Then we will dig it out.

28
00:03:25,248 --> 00:03:29,168
Luis, I'm going to Morajo
Bay, to the institute.

29
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:30,962
You two are to
wait here in the camp.

30
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:32,046
You be gone long?

31
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,591
Long enough to
find out what this is

32
00:03:34,674 --> 00:03:37,802
and get help in digging out
the rest of the skeleton.

33
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:48,563
I want a man in camp at all times.
Luis, you will be in charge.

34
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,626
I'm sure you scared
all the fish away.

35
00:04:51,709 --> 00:04:52,961
At the depths
he's working, Doctor,

36
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,880
the fish won't hear a
thing, believe me.

37
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:49,517
Ah. There he is.
See him?

38
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,852
What's he waiting for?

39
00:05:50,935 --> 00:05:53,771
He's getting used to
the change in pressure.

40
00:05:59,694 --> 00:06:01,320
KAY: Ah. Here he comes.

41
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:03,781
DAVID: Hi.

42
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,075
David. David, I have
a surprise for you.

43
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,785
Yeah?

44
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:10,997
Carl Maia!

45
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,248
It isn't you!

46
00:06:12,331 --> 00:06:14,876
What's left of me,
Dr. David Reed.

47
00:06:14,959 --> 00:06:17,420
The last I heard of you, you
were up in the Amazon someplace

48
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,088
digging for old
skeletons and things.

49
00:06:19,172 --> 00:06:22,050
And you two were doing research
for an aquarium in California.

50
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:23,551
What are you
doing in Brazil?

51
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,429
On, we've been guests at your
institute for a month now.

52
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,639
We're looking for
specimens of lungfish.

53
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:32,185
David, you still don't look like
an ichthyologist. (ALL CHUCKLING)

54
00:06:32,268 --> 00:06:33,811
A geologist's
point of view.

55
00:06:33,895 --> 00:06:36,856
He expected a loveable old
professor with a beard.

56
00:06:36,939 --> 00:06:40,068
I didn't expect him to look like he
did when he was a student of mine.

57
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:42,153
Give me a shoulder, Kay.

58
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,864
Are you two married yet?

59
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,116
No. No, David says we're
together all the time anyway,

60
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,160
might as well
save expenses.

61
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,913
Did you ever hear of two
living as cheaply as one?

62
00:06:51,996 --> 00:06:53,372
That's what I keep
telling him, Carl.

63
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,875
I'm waiting for Williams
to give her that raise.

64
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,543
Then she can afford me.
Oh!

65
00:06:57,627 --> 00:07:01,005
Come on. Let's go ashore.
it's good to see you again, Carl.

66
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,051
Show him what
brought you back, Carl.

67
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:08,429
I found this in
a limestone deposit

68
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:11,015
dating back to
the Devonian age.

69
00:07:19,816 --> 00:07:21,901
I was hoping you
experts on marine life

70
00:07:21,984 --> 00:07:23,402
could make some
identification.

71
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:25,404
DAVID: I've never seen
anything like this.

72
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:27,156
KAY: Look at the webbing
between the fingers, David.

73
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,324
DAVID: Yeah.

74
00:07:28,658 --> 00:07:32,537
Maybe we'll know more about it after
I find the rest of the skeleton.

75
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,455
Boy, I'd sure like to
be with you when you do.

76
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,665
So would I.

77
00:07:35,748 --> 00:07:38,793
What about your boss?
You think he would be interested?

78
00:07:38,876 --> 00:07:40,336
Williams? (CHUCKLES)

79
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:43,589
If there's a chance of any publicity,
just try and keep him away.

80
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:46,467
Now, be fair, David.
Publicity brings endowments.

81
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,469
And without money,
there isn't any research.

82
00:07:48,553 --> 00:07:51,722
That's right, if it weren't for Dr.
Williams going on digging up the dough,

83
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:53,808
we wouldn't be down here.

84
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,394
Where is this thing?

85
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,854
At the institute.

86
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:24,422
DR. MAIA: Here it is,
gentlemen.

87
00:08:26,716 --> 00:08:28,926
Exactly as I found it.

88
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:32,138
It's amazing.
it's incredible!

89
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:36,309
MARK: Could it possibly
belong to a Pleistocene man?

90
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,227
Chances are much
greater that that hand

91
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:39,687
belonged to
an amphibian, Mark,

92
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,106
one that spent a great
deal of time in the water.

93
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,692
Well, then now do you account for
the structure of the fingers,

94
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,694
obviously for land use?

95
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:48,946
What do you
think, Dr. Matos?

96
00:08:49,155 --> 00:08:53,284
We can be sure of one thing.
Whatever it was, it was very powerful.

97
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:56,537
You say you have hopes of
finding the rest of the fossil?

98
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,207
As soon as I get a suitable
expedition together.

99
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,043
Well, why don't we
make up the expedition?

100
00:09:02,126 --> 00:09:03,377
We're here now,
and after all,

101
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:05,546
it does come under the heading
of our work, doesn't it, David?

102
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,964
It certainly does.

103
00:09:07,048 --> 00:09:09,008
More and more,
we're learning the meaning

104
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,968
and the value of
marine research.

105
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,804
Look, look over here.

106
00:09:14,847 --> 00:09:16,182
This lungfish,

107
00:09:16,474 --> 00:09:19,310
the bridge between fish
and the land animal.

108
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,772
How many thousands of ways nature
tried to get life out of the sea

109
00:09:22,855 --> 00:09:24,232
and onto the land.

110
00:09:24,315 --> 00:09:28,027
This one failed.
He hasn't changed in millions of years.

111
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:29,862
But here,

112
00:09:31,155 --> 00:09:33,824
here we have
a clue to an answer.

113
00:09:33,908 --> 00:09:36,911
Someday, spaceships will be traveling
from Earth to other planets.

114
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:39,455
How are human beings going
to survive on those planets?

115
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:41,040
The atmosphere
will be different,

116
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,959
the pressures
will be different.

117
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:47,129
By studying these
and other species,

118
00:09:47,213 --> 00:09:49,298
we add to our knowledge
of how life evolved,

119
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:52,009
how it adapted itself
to this world.

120
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,553
With that knowledge,
perhaps we can teach men

121
00:09:54,637 --> 00:09:57,223
to adapt themselves to some
new world of the future.

122
00:09:57,306 --> 00:10:00,518
Nice speech, David, but there's
still a practical side to it.

123
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,145
If I sound brash and more like
a banker than a scientist,

124
00:10:03,229 --> 00:10:06,607
try to remember that it takes money
to run an institute like ours.

125
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:08,609
A find of any real
importance can be

126
00:10:08,693 --> 00:10:11,195
of great financial
value to us also.

127
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,197
Certainly, your board
couldnâ€™t disapprove.

128
00:10:13,281 --> 00:10:14,782
It certainly couldn't.

129
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:17,910
Dr. Maia, you've got
yourself an expedition.

130
00:10:17,994 --> 00:10:20,288
Good, we'll leave for
Manaus in the morning.

131
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:23,040
From there, we'll take
a boat up river.

132
00:10:36,971 --> 00:10:38,639

00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,882
it's so hot.

00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:56,967
It'll get hotter.

140
00:12:00,304 --> 00:12:03,891
Couldn't Maia find anything
better than this barge?

141
00:12:03,974 --> 00:12:07,311
Well, I guess not many ships want to
go up river as far as we're going.

142
00:12:07,395 --> 00:12:10,648
We didn't exactly expect to
get the Ile de France either.

143
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,566
You don't like the Rita?

144
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:13,901
What the doctor
meant, Lucas...

145
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,444
I know what
the doctor means.

146
00:12:15,528 --> 00:12:17,738
But what for I need
a sweet-smelling boat

147
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:20,408
to carry fish on
this crazy river?

148
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:23,119
How do you like the best cabin
on the Rita, Miss Lawrence?

149
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,245
I love it!

150
00:12:24,328 --> 00:12:25,329
Good.

151
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:28,958
Well, now we have a lab,
such as it is.

152
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:31,043
Let's hope we have
some use for it.

153
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:33,170
I'll be disappointed
if we don't.

154
00:12:33,295 --> 00:12:36,340
Assuming, of course, that Dr.
Maia's facts are well-founded.

155
00:12:36,424 --> 00:12:40,594
Dr. Maia's a scientist, not a fortuneteller
How can he guarantee anything?

156
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:42,763
Well, it seems to me,
a scientist has need

The country is full of wild animals.

this tributary empties into?

212
00:17:02,648 --> 00:17:06,276
My boys used to tell me there's
a lagoon at the end of it.

213
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,071
What are you
getting at?

214
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:10,948
I was just thinking.

215
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,367
It could be that at
some time in the past,

216
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:16,370
part of this bank broke away
and fell into the river here.

Over hundreds of years, perhaps
over thousands of years,

218
00:17:19,081 --> 00:17:20,624
the current
would break it up.

219
00:17:20,708 --> 00:17:22,584
If there is a dead end
to this tributary,

220
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:24,545
that's where we'll
find the fragments.

221
00:17:24,628 --> 00:17:27,256
We might even find
the rest of your fossil.

222
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:28,590
It's a theory.

223
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:30,050
What's wrong with that?

224
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:32,386
Even if David's
theory is correct,

225
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:34,888
the chances of finding
anything are remote.

226
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,641
Science is always taking the remote chance.
Why don't we try it?

227
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,476
We might still turn
failure into success.

00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:47,774
DAVID: Carl,
I got your samples.

316
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:49,359
Good.

317
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:51,236
Let me have them.

318
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:52,529
Here they are.

319
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,615
Thank you, David.

320
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:57,534
And this is
something for you.

321
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,996
Oh! Well, thank you.
They're very pretty.

322
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:02,539
Let's test them
right away.

323
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,457
DR. MAIA: Will you help me, Doctor?
DR. THOMPSON: Be glad to.

324
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:06,209
DR. MAIA Thank you.

325
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:14,551
Come on, David.
You can play house later.

326
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:17,053
(SLAMS)

327
00:27:17,721 --> 00:27:21,141
David. About Mark.

328
00:27:21,224 --> 00:27:22,559
Well, what about him?

329
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:24,436
Try to understand.

330
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:26,062
I've been trying.

331
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,148
Somebody ought to tell him
his ambition is showing.

332
00:27:28,231 --> 00:27:30,150
It won't do
any good, I know.

333
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:32,986
Long before you came to
work with us, I tried.

334
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:35,238
But there's this
to say for him,

335
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,657
he's produced some
important findings.

336
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,660
He's also taken credit
for some important findings.

337
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:42,746
Well, coming below?

338
00:27:42,829 --> 00:27:47,000
No. No, I'll wait up here.
Hey, what was it like down there?

339
00:27:48,126 --> 00:27:50,503
Like another world.

340
00:27:50,587 --> 00:27:52,672
I'd like to see it.

341
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:10,161
Crazy kind of fishing,
for rocks! (CHUCKLING)

Miss Lawrence!

344
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:20,171
You're too far out,
Miss Lawrence!

345
00:31:23,258 --> 00:31:26,344
Hey,Zee!
Go start the motor!

346
00:31:26,427 --> 00:31:28,638
Chico! Pull up the anchor!

347
00:31:44,487 --> 00:31:48,575
DAVID: Kay, what are you doing out there?
Come on back!

348
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:51,703
LUCAS: You take it easy.
We get you!

349
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:10,221
Drop the anchor.

350
00:32:22,734 --> 00:32:24,694
KAY: Thanks, Lucas.

351
00:32:25,069 --> 00:32:27,488
Kay, that wasn't
a very smart thing to do.

352
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:29,407
KAY; But wonderful!
(BOAT BREAKING)

353
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:33,828
What was that?

354
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:35,330
Something's in the net.

355
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,709
Pull up your net!

356
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,086
Come on. Hurry up!
Take it away!

357
00:32:43,713 --> 00:32:45,048
DAVID: Pull it up!

358
00:32:46,257 --> 00:32:47,884
Pull it up!

359
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:49,719

(CREAKING)

362
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:01,230
Is it fouled
against the side?

363
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:03,316
DAVID: Pull it up!

364
00:33:08,321 --> 00:33:09,739
The boom's cracking!

365
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,076
Slack off your winch!

00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:15,828
Slack off!

He can't hear you!

368
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,311
Hey, what kind of
fish do this?

369
00:33:40,395 --> 00:33:41,396
Who says it was a fish?

370
00:33:41,479 --> 00:33:43,523
The net could've hooked on
to some underwater rock.

371
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:47,610
Wait a minute.

372
00:33:48,236 --> 00:33:50,780
It was no rock that
left this in the net.

373
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:55,368
It's amazing!

374
00:33:55,451 --> 00:33:57,537
I just finished
the rock analysis.

375
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,122
And you were
right, David.

376
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:01,833
Some of the limestone deposit
where I found the fossil

377
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,293
is on the bottom
of this lagoon.

378
00:34:13,344 --> 00:34:16,723
Lucas, put that over the
side for me, will you?

379
00:34:16,806 --> 00:34:20,393
Whatever the species might be, if you
let it alone, it won't bother you.

380
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:24,397
Maybe. But if you're wrong, this
harpoon will correct any mistakes.

381
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:28,109
Mark, we're out for photographs
for study, not trophies.

382
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:32,238
This thing alive and in its natural
habitat, it's valuable to us.

383
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:35,199
Why settle for a photo when
we can get the real thing?

384
00:34:35,283 --> 00:34:36,451
You don't sound
like a scientist.

385
00:34:36,534 --> 00:34:40,037
You sound like some big-game
hunter out for the kill.

386
00:34:40,121 --> 00:34:41,748
We may not be
back home, David,

387
00:34:41,831 --> 00:34:44,083
but you're still
working for me.

(SPEAR GUN FIRES)

389
00:39:29,744 --> 00:39:32,997
You didn't wait long
enough before coming up.

390
00:39:35,332 --> 00:39:37,043
Why'd you shoot?
You weren't attacked!

391
00:39:37,126 --> 00:39:39,420
You sound as though I put
the harpoon through you.

392
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:40,671
What makes you think
we're supposed

393
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,381
to play tag with the
thing, whatever it is?

394
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:44,133
I tell you, we can learn
more from it if it's alive!

395
00:39:44,592 --> 00:39:46,844
Please, what is it
that you found?

396
00:39:46,927 --> 00:39:48,387
I don't know
what you'd call it.

397
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:51,640
It sounds incredible, but
it appeared to be human.

398
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:53,726
I tell you,

399
00:39:53,809 --> 00:39:56,729
if it's what I think I saw,
it's the greatest find yet.

400
00:39:56,812 --> 00:39:58,064
Nothing compares to it.

401
00:39:58,147 --> 00:40:00,066
I've got the proof
here in my lens.

402
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:11,077
LUCAS: Many years ago, I hear
this legend on the river.

403
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:14,121
A very old native tell me of
a man who live underwater,

404
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,623
but she was crazy.

405
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:18,334
"Crazy Goole," everybody called her.
(LAUGHING)

406
00:40:18,417 --> 00:40:20,586
The unknown always
seems unbelievable, Lucas.

407
00:40:21,212 --> 00:40:23,547
One accepts these things as
legend and lets it go at that,

408
00:40:23,631 --> 00:40:25,633
but to actually believe
that there exists something

409
00:40:25,716 --> 00:40:27,718
like a human being
that can live underwater...

410
00:40:28,302 --> 00:40:31,347
This is no legend, as you'll
soon see for yourself.

411
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,807
What about the kamongo?

412
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:35,226
Science hadn't heard about
it until a few years ago.

413
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:37,770
The kamongo lived way back
in the Devonian age.

414
00:40:37,853 --> 00:40:41,690
Interesting that the fossil I
found was out of the same period.

415
00:40:41,774 --> 00:40:44,235
The kamongo was
a fish that breathed air.

416
00:40:44,318 --> 00:40:46,195
What does that prove?
KAY: Nothing.

417
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:48,489
Except that the kamongo
fish, which has lungs,

418
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:50,741
exists today, right
here in the Amazon.

419
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:52,952
It hasn't changed in all
these millions of years.

420
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:55,454
That doesn't prove the
possibility of a gillman.

421
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,331
If the evolution
of that species

422
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,208
could reach a dead end
way back then

423
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:00,751
and still survive,

424
00:41:00,835 --> 00:41:02,503
why couldn't another?

425
00:41:05,714 --> 00:41:07,299
DR. THOMPSON: Where is he?

426
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,553
I was sure I had him
in my finder.

427
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,848
For a merman,
he takes a fine picture.

428
00:41:13,931 --> 00:41:16,308
This wasn't
imagination, Doctor.

429
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:17,476
I'm sorry, David.

430
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,312
What proof do we have
if we never find it again?

431
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:22,356
If you hadn't stopped me,
we could have taken it!

432
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:24,316
Dead or alive,
what's the difference?

433
00:41:36,412 --> 00:41:37,580
Ahhh!

434
00:41:38,581 --> 00:41:39,790
(SPLASHING)

435
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:46,338
What happened?

(ZEE SOBBING)

438
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,343

439

Chico!

440
00:41:55,556 --> 00:41:57,016
Chico is gone.

441
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:00,519
My brother was dragged down
into the water by a demon!

442
00:42:00,603 --> 00:42:01,979
Come on, everybody,
look around, quick!

443
00:42:02,062 --> 00:42:03,105
Chico!

444
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:04,565
Demon, eh?

445
00:42:04,648 --> 00:42:07,401
It's no more far-fetched
than your gillman.

446
00:42:07,484 --> 00:42:10,196
There are many strange
legends in the Amazon.

447
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:14,033
Even I, Lucas, have heard
the legend of a man-fish.

448
00:42:14,116 --> 00:42:15,784
DR. MAIA: Over here! Quickly!

449
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:19,288
LOOK!

450
00:42:29,924 --> 00:42:32,551
All right, Lucas,
start your pumps.

451
00:42:32,635 --> 00:42:34,553
Now all we have
to do is catch him.

452
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:36,805
Don't waste your time.
You'll never take it alive.

453
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:38,140
I want to try, Mark.

454
00:42:38,390 --> 00:42:41,185
All right, David, we can
always do it my way.

455
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:44,146
If we could just be sure
of its reaction.

456
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,566
Do you suppose it remembers
Mark's attack and seeks revenge?

457
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:49,401
I'll welcome it.

458
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:51,654
You'll get your wish,
all right.

459
00:42:51,737 --> 00:42:56,367
I've got a hunch this creature
remembers the past and more.

460
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,245
I don't want him creeping up
on us while we're sleeping.

461
00:42:59,328 --> 00:43:01,163
I know a way to
bring him up now.

462
00:43:02,164 --> 00:43:03,582
Rotenone.

463
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:05,584
It's a drug which
natives make from roots

464
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:07,544
for catching fish
in still waters.

465
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:10,297
Sometimes I catch fish that way.
I show you. Look.

466
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,134
Excuse.

467
00:43:15,386 --> 00:43:18,305
One taste of the poison
water, and poof!

468
00:43:18,389 --> 00:43:21,767
The paralyzed fish floats up to
the top with a big hangover.

469
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,061
Come on! Let's try it.

470
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,294
Still no sign.

471
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:32,463
Nothing but
the little ones so far.

472
00:44:32,546 --> 00:44:34,089
Could be he's dead
from the wound.

473
00:44:35,215 --> 00:44:39,178
Then again, maybe the rotenone
isn't going deep enough.

474
00:44:39,261 --> 00:44:42,765
Maybe we should fix the
rotenone to sink deeper down.

Yeah. Anything
is worth a try.

Why won't they
believe, Mark?
