<i>(man)</i> Tomas! Tomas!

Tomas!

19
00:02:48,774 --> 00:02:50,478
Please.

20
00:02:57,388 --> 00:02:59,175
<i>(native)</i> What that is, Dr Maia?

21
00:02:59,261 --> 00:03:02,917
I don't know, Luis. I have never seen
anything like this before.

22
00:03:03,006 --> 00:03:04,793
Is important?

23
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:08,620
Yes. I think it is. Very important.

24
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:15,777
We will take one more picture.
Then we will dig it out.

25
00:03:24,853 --> 00:03:28,758
Luis, I'm going to Morajo Bay,
to the institute.

26
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:31,676
- You two are to wait here in the camp.
- You be gone long?

27
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:34,328
Long enough to find out what this is

28
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:37,619
and get help in digging out
the rest of the skeleton.

29
00:03:43,538 --> 00:03:47,905
I want a man in camp at all times.
Luis, you will be in charge.

30
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,071
I'm sure you scared all the fish away.

31
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,775
At the depth he's working, Doctor,
the fish won't hear a thing, believe me.

32
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,915
Ah. There he is. See him?

33
00:05:49,003 --> 00:05:53,038
- What's he waiting for?
- He's adjusting to the change in pressure.

34
00:05:58,907 --> 00:06:00,776
Ah. Here he comes.

35
00:06:01,612 --> 00:06:05,221
- Hi.
- David, I have a surprise for you.

36
00:06:05,315 --> 00:06:06,935
Yeah?

37
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:10,182
Carl Maia!

38
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:14,173
- It isn't you!
- What's left of me, Dr David Reed.

39
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:18,037
The last I heard, you were up
the Amazon digging for old skeletons.

40
00:06:18,132 --> 00:06:21,410
You too were doing research,
for an aquarium in California.

41
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:25,491
- What are you doing in Brazil?
- We've been at your institute for a month.

42
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:27,817
We're looking for specimens of lungfish.

43
00:06:27,912 --> 00:06:31,486
David, you still don't look
like an ichthyologist.

44
00:06:31,574 --> 00:06:35,976
The geologist's point of view. He expected
the lovable old professor with a beard.

45
00:06:36,068 --> 00:06:39,263
I didn't expect him to look like he did
when he was my student.

46
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:41,426
Give me your shoulder, Kay.

47
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,134
Are you two married yet?

48
00:06:44,224 --> 00:06:48,212
No. David says we're together all the time
anyway. Might as well save expenses.

49
00:06:48,302 --> 00:06:52,503
- How about two living as cheaply as one?
- That's what I keep telling him, Carl.

50
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:56,707
I'm waiting for Williams to give her
that raise. Then she can afford me.

51
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,448
Come on, let's go ashore.
It's good to see you again, Carl.

52
00:07:01,785 --> 00:07:04,400
Show him what brought you back, Carl.

53
00:07:05,322 --> 00:07:10,730
I found this in a limestone deposit
dating back to the Devonian age.

54
00:07:18,805 --> 00:07:22,710
I was hoping you experts on marine life
could make some identification.

55
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,285
- <i>(David)</i> I've never seen anything like this.
- <i>(Kay)</i> Look at the webbed fingers.

56
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:31,662
Maybe we'll know more about it
after I find the rest of the skeleton.

57
00:07:31,747 --> 00:07:34,657
- I'd sure like to be with you when you do.
- So would I.

58
00:07:34,743 --> 00:07:37,772
What about your boss?
Do you think he would be interested?

59
00:07:37,864 --> 00:07:42,562
Williams? If there's a chance of
any publicity, just try and keep him away.

60
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,466
Be fair. Publicity brings endowments.
And without money, there is no research.

61
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,051
Right. If it weren't for Dr Williams digging
up the dough, we wouldn't be down here.

62
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:56,625
- Where is this thing?
- At the institute.

63
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:22,881
<i>(Dr Maia)</i> Here it is, gentlemen.

64
00:08:25,678 --> 00:08:27,749
Exactly as I found it.

65
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:31,333
- It's amazing.
- It's incredible!

66
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:35,164
Could it possibly belong
to a Pleistocene man?

67
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:38,444
Chances are that that hand belonged
to an amphibian, Mark.

68
00:08:38,537 --> 00:08:40,939
One that spent
a great deal of time in the water.

69
00:08:41,034 --> 00:08:46,064
So how do you account for the structure
of the fingers, obviously for land use?

70
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:49,595
- What do <i>you</i> think, Dr Matos?
- We can be sure of one thing.

71
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:52,221
Whatever it was, it was very powerful.

72
00:08:52,852 --> 00:08:55,218
You say you hope to find
the rest of the fossil?

73
00:08:55,307 --> 00:08:58,005
As soon as I get
a suitable expedition together.

74
00:08:58,095 --> 00:09:00,758
Well, why don't <i>we</i> make up
the expedition?

75
00:09:00,842 --> 00:09:04,333
It does come under the heading
of our work, doesn't it, David?

76
00:09:04,421 --> 00:09:09,237
It certainly does. More and more we're
learning the value of marine research.

77
00:09:10,455 --> 00:09:12,526
Look. Look over here.

78
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:17,813
This lungfish - the bridge
between fish and the land animal.

79
00:09:17,903 --> 00:09:22,719
How many thousands of ways nature tried
to get life out of the sea and onto the land.

80
00:09:23,064 --> 00:09:26,887
This one failed.
He hasn't changed in millions of years.

81
00:09:27,433 --> 00:09:29,421
But here...

82
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:32,426
Here we have a clue to an answer.

83
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:35,622
Some day spaceships will be travelling
to other planets.

84
00:09:35,714 --> 00:09:38,246
How will human beings survive
on those planets?

85
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:42,406
The atmosphere will be different,
the pressures will be different.

86
00:09:43,205 --> 00:09:45,737
By studying these, and other species,

87
00:09:45,826 --> 00:09:50,690
we add to our knowledge of how life
evolved and adapted itself to this world.

88
00:09:50,778 --> 00:09:54,020
With that knowledge, perhaps
men will learn to adapt themselves

89
00:09:54,107 --> 00:09:55,976
to some new world of the future.

90
00:09:56,063 --> 00:09:59,175
Nice speech, David.
But there's still a practical side to it.

91
00:09:59,267 --> 00:10:01,799
If I sound more like a banker
than a scientist,

92
00:10:01,889 --> 00:10:05,332
try to remember that it takes money
to run an institute like ours.

93
00:10:05,426 --> 00:10:09,627
A find of any real importance
can be of great financial value to us also.

94
00:10:09,712 --> 00:10:13,487
- Your board couldn't disapprove.
- It certainly couldn't.

95
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,531
Dr Maia, you've got
yourself an expedition.

96
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,448
Good.

97
00:10:17,536 --> 00:10:22,601
We'll leave for Manaus in the morning.
From there we'll take a boat up the river.

98
00:10:35,596 --> 00:10:37,667
<i>(squelching footsteps)</i>

99
00:10:57,568 --> 00:11:00,183
<i>(growling)</i>

100
00:11:04,476 --> 00:11:06,132
No. Tomas!

101
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,457
<i>(roar)</i>

102
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:13,168
No. No... No!

103
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,534
- <i>(creature roars)</i>
- <i>(screams)</i>

104
00:11:27,696 --> 00:11:30,643
- <i>(creature roars)</i>
- <i>(screams)</i>

105
00:11:51,749 --> 00:11:53,369
It's so hot.

106
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:55,359
And it'll get hotter.

107
00:11:57,117 --> 00:11:58,737
<i>(angry kick)</i>

108
00:11:58,823 --> 00:12:02,349
Couldn't Maia find
anything better than this barge?

109
00:12:02,444 --> 00:12:05,686
I guess not many ships
want to go upriver as far as we're going.

110
00:12:05,773 --> 00:12:09,051
We didn't exactly expect
to get the <i>Île de France</i> either.

111
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:10,848
You don't like the <i>Rita,</i> eh?

112
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:13,843
- What the doctor meant, Lucas...
- I know what he means.

113
00:12:13,929 --> 00:12:18,793
But what for I need a sweet-smelling boat
to carry fish on this crazy river?

114
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:21,540
How you like the best cabin,
Miss Lawrence?

115
00:12:21,628 --> 00:12:23,699
- I love it.
- Good.

116
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,325
Well, now we have a lab,
such as it is.

117
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:31,649
- Well, let's hope we have some use for it.
- I'll be disappointed if we don't.

118
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:34,687
Assuming that Dr Maia's facts
are well founded.

119
00:12:34,778 --> 00:12:39,015
Dr Maia's a scientist, not a fortune-teller.
How can he guarantee anything?

120
00:12:39,105 --> 00:12:43,803
It seems to me a scientist has need
for both vision and confidence.

121
00:12:43,891 --> 00:12:46,885
I didn't mean it
as any personal criticism, Doctor.

122
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,082
It's just that
I always look forward to success.

123
00:12:50,175 --> 00:12:52,541
<i>(boat whistle)</i>

124
00:12:56,167 --> 00:12:58,155
<i>(chuckles)</i>

125
00:13:13,478 --> 00:13:15,963
And I thought
the Mississippi was something.

126
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:18,756
It's a winding brook
compared to the Amazon.

127
00:13:19,637 --> 00:13:24,453
This is exactly as it was 150 million years
ago, when it was part of the Devonian era.

128
00:13:24,547 --> 00:13:27,908
- Sounds like the beginning of the world.
- It is.

129
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:32,071
Even the animals here
grow as they did in Devonian forests.

130
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:35,275
The anteater is a giant
with the strength of a bear.

131
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:37,817
The centipede grows to be a foot long.

132
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:40,271
The Amazonian rat is as big as a sheep.

133
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,395
- That's incredible!
- It's true.

134
00:13:42,483 --> 00:13:44,933
And don't forget our catfish.

135
00:13:45,021 --> 00:13:48,263
They grow to be nine feet long -
and killers.

136
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:51,427
Like everything in this jungle.
All killers.

137
00:13:51,513 --> 00:13:54,921
Oh, Dr Maia says we're gonna
drop anchor in a couple of hours.

138
00:13:55,009 --> 00:13:57,576
Maybe you'd better get some rest, eh?

139
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:03,405
<i>(boat whistle)</i>

140
00:14:04,788 --> 00:14:06,610
Again, Lucas.

141
00:14:08,367 --> 00:14:11,361
We want to make sure
my boys hear us at camp.

142
00:14:11,446 --> 00:14:14,144
When we anchor, we'll take a rowboat.

143
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,227
Luis!

144
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:21,050
Tomas!

145
00:14:22,058 --> 00:14:23,678
Luis!

146
00:14:28,383 --> 00:14:30,371
Luis! Tomas!

147
00:14:32,461 --> 00:14:35,739
- It's strange they'd be gone.
- Could they have gone hunting?

148
00:14:35,832 --> 00:14:39,607
I gave strict orders for one man
to remain in camp at all times.

149
00:14:39,702 --> 00:14:42,612
- Come on.
- Stay here, Kay.

150
00:14:42,698 --> 00:14:45,064
Wait till we find out what's going on.

151
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,176
Luis!

152
00:14:54,641 --> 00:14:56,380
What could have happened?

153
00:14:56,472 --> 00:14:58,259
I don't understand.

154
00:14:58,345 --> 00:15:01,871
There's only one explanation.
The country is full of wild animals.

155
00:15:01,965 --> 00:15:06,497
I think maybe jaguar.
Jaguar's claws, they rip like this.

156
00:15:22,897 --> 00:15:24,601
Where's Kay?

157
00:15:24,686 --> 00:15:25,714
Kay!

158
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:27,217
Kay!

159
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,871
- What happened?
- There's been trouble.

160
00:15:36,504 --> 00:15:38,787
Let's go back on board, Kay.

161
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,592
A world-shaking find, all right.

162
00:16:35,388 --> 00:16:40,371
Eight days, and all we dig up
are enough stones to pave a road.

163
00:16:41,089 --> 00:16:43,290
Had enough, Mark,
or do we keep on digging?

164
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,281
I'll tell you when I've had enough.

165
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:49,945
We failed.
That's all people will understand.

166
00:16:55,445 --> 00:16:59,729
Carl, have you any idea
what this tributary empties into?

167
00:17:00,314 --> 00:17:03,639
My boys used to tell me
there's a lagoon at the end of it.

168
00:17:04,892 --> 00:17:06,714
What are you getting at?

169
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:10,924
I was just thinking.
It could be that at some time in the past,

170
00:17:11,009 --> 00:17:14,121
part of this bank broke away
and fell into the river here.

171
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:18,153
Over hundreds of years, perhaps
thousands, the current would break it up.

172
00:17:18,250 --> 00:17:22,238
If there is a dead end to this tributary,
that's where we'll find the fragments.

173
00:17:22,328 --> 00:17:25,108
We might even find the rest of your fossil.

174
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:27,684
- It's a theory.
- What's wrong with that?

175
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:32,347
Even if David's theory is correct, the
chances of finding anything are remote.

176
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,304
But science always
takes remote chances. Why not try it?

177
00:17:35,395 --> 00:17:40,046
- We might still turn failure into success.
- There's just one thing, Mark.

178
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:43,292
Going into unexplored territory
with a woman.

179
00:17:43,384 --> 00:17:46,129
I'm not afraid, David,
and we've come this far.

180
00:17:46,214 --> 00:17:49,954
I know, but... I keep remembering
what happened to Carl's men.

181
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:53,238
That doesn't sound like
the dedicated scientist talking.

182
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:56,158
Dedication doesn't mean
risking the lives of others.

183
00:17:56,243 --> 00:17:58,906
I've always found
Kay was able to take care of herself.

184
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:01,060
<i>(Dr Maia)</i> We know nothing
about this lagoon.

185
00:18:01,153 --> 00:18:03,389
I can tell you something about this place.

186
00:18:03,484 --> 00:18:07,602
My boys call it the Black Lagoon -
a paradise.

187
00:18:07,687 --> 00:18:11,343
Only, they say, nobody has ever
come back to prove it.

188
00:18:13,846 --> 00:18:15,917
We'll do it.

189
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:34,809
<i>(animal howls)</i>

190
00:18:38,439 --> 00:18:39,681
Oh!

191
00:18:39,771 --> 00:18:42,221
- Oh, David.
- I didn't mean to startle you.

192
00:18:42,309 --> 00:18:44,510
I don't know what made me do that.

193
00:18:44,598 --> 00:18:49,166
- That howling out there doesn't help any.
- Ah, those are Guariba monkeys.

194
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:52,665
Are you sorry now that we came?

195
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:56,165
You don't understand the species
very well, Doctor.

196
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,486
Give me time. I thought I was doing well,

197
00:18:58,580 --> 00:19:02,485
considering that we've only
been together for six months.

198
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:05,025
How much time do you think you'll need?

199
00:19:05,114 --> 00:19:08,356
From where I'm sitting, I'd say...
a lifetime.

200
00:19:10,066 --> 00:19:13,344
- That's the right answer.
- <i>(animal growling)</i>

201
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:17,134
We may not even <i>have</i> a lifetime.

202
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:18,927
In that case...

203
00:19:23,548 --> 00:19:25,749
You mean this thing really works?

204
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:29,573
Oh, yes.

205
00:19:29,666 --> 00:19:33,358
It's a very positive weapon,
the spear gun, Lucas, and easy to use.

206
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:35,605
All you do is aim it and squeeze.

207
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,901
What are you gonna shoot at?

208
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:40,767
Make any difference?

209
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:47,470
Hey!

210
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:59,868
- <i>(David)</i> Can you take it any slower?
- Ease her off, a little bit. Not too much.

211
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,908
- Give me that hook.
- We may just make it on this side.

212
00:20:02,998 --> 00:20:04,405
It's tight over here.

213
00:20:11,571 --> 00:20:13,475
Is impossible!

214
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:16,396
But I, Lucas, will do it! Eh?

215
00:20:29,423 --> 00:20:32,086
<i>(animal howls)</i>

216
00:20:35,623 --> 00:20:37,989
<i>(David)</i> The Black Lagoon.

217
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:40,149
<i>(Kay)</i> Beautiful lagoon.

218
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:42,941
<i>(Dr Thompson)</i> Another world.

219
00:20:43,946 --> 00:20:46,431
A little farther.
Then get the net over the side.

220
00:20:46,526 --> 00:20:48,146
You expect to catch a fish?

221
00:20:48,232 --> 00:20:50,433
We might as well see
what species are here.

222
00:20:50,521 --> 00:20:54,213
We're not interested in fish.
We're after the rest of that fossil.

223
00:20:54,308 --> 00:20:56,840
I need rocks
from the bottom of the lagoon to test.

224
00:20:56,929 --> 00:20:58,917
- But we just got here.
- Why waste time?

225
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:03,791
If any of the wall that contained the fossil
is here, the rock test should prove it.

226
00:21:03,879 --> 00:21:06,115
- I'll get the aqualungs.
- Be careful, David.

227
00:21:06,209 --> 00:21:08,410
We don't know what's down there.

228
00:21:09,996 --> 00:21:13,984
- I hope you're afraid for me too, Kay.
- Of course, Mark.

229
00:21:14,074 --> 00:21:16,145
<i>(animal howls)</i>

230
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:22,103
A little faster! Come on!

231
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:24,721
Faster! All right! Let it down!

232
00:21:24,811 --> 00:21:27,047
All the way! Come on! Down, down!

233
00:21:27,141 --> 00:21:28,797
All the way!

234
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:30,545
All right, hold it!

235
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:34,130
Here we go.

236
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:36,368
- We got the net down, David.
- Good.

237
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:41,327
This is crazy kind of fishing.
Who eats rocks?

238
00:21:41,414 --> 00:21:43,816
I do, in a manner of speaking.

239
00:21:43,911 --> 00:21:46,478
I crush them, and they tell me things.

240
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:48,771
Now you be careful.

241
00:23:53,704 --> 00:23:56,106
What these rocks tell you, anyway?

242
00:23:56,201 --> 00:23:59,810
How old they are.
It's called the uranium-lead test.

243
00:24:00,778 --> 00:24:03,263
What do you wanna know that for?

244
00:24:04,066 --> 00:24:08,800
So we can match 'em against the sample
in which the fossil was found.

245
00:26:13,276 --> 00:26:15,347
<i>(Kay)</i> Hey, they're up.

246
00:26:16,148 --> 00:26:19,757
- How long they have to wait there?
- It depends how far down they went.

247
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:39,151
- Well, how was it down there?
- Oh, fine.

248
00:26:39,243 --> 00:26:41,775
- I'll help you off with this equipment.
- Good.

249
00:26:41,865 --> 00:26:45,060
- <i>(David)</i> Carl? I got your samples.
- Good.

250
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:48,810
- Let me have them.
- Here they are.

251
00:26:50,645 --> 00:26:53,887
- Thank you, David.
- And this, something for you.

252
00:26:53,974 --> 00:26:57,003
Oh! Well, thank you! They're very pretty.

253
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:58,960
Let's test 'em right away.

254
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,873
- Will you help me, Doctor?
- Be glad to.

255
00:27:00,966 --> 00:27:02,622
Thank you.

256
00:27:07,998 --> 00:27:10,565
Come on, David.
You can play house later.

257
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,652
David...

258
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:17,477
About Mark.

259
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:20,811
- Well? What about him?
- Try to understand.

260
00:27:20,899 --> 00:27:24,390
I've been trying. Somebody oughta
tell him his ambition is showing.

261
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,548
It won't do any good. I know.

262
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:29,339
Long before you came to work with us,
I tried.

263
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:33,914
But there's this to say for him:
He's produced some important findings.

264
00:27:34,007 --> 00:27:37,450
He's also taken credit
for some important findings.

265
00:27:37,544 --> 00:27:40,869
- Well, coming below?
- No. I'll wait up here.

266
00:27:40,956 --> 00:27:43,157
Hey, what was it like down there?

267
00:27:44,535 --> 00:27:46,818
Like another world.

268
00:27:46,907 --> 00:27:48,978
I'd like to see it.

269
00:31:03,157 --> 00:31:05,476
Crazy kind of fishing - for rocks.

270

Hey! What kind of fish do this?

297
00:33:35,837 --> 00:33:40,038
Who says it was a fish? The net could've
hooked onto some underwater rock.

298
00:33:41,247 --> 00:33:42,903
Wait.

299
00:33:43,578 --> 00:33:46,406
It was no rock that left <i>this</i> in the net.

300
00:33:48,904 --> 00:33:50,726
It's amazing.

301
00:33:50,818 --> 00:33:54,558
I just finished a rock analysis.
And you were right, David.

302
00:33:54,647 --> 00:33:57,427
Some of the limestone deposit
where I found the fossil

303
00:33:57,518 --> 00:33:59,837
is on the bottom of this lagoon.

304
00:34:08,754 --> 00:34:12,079
Lucas, put that over the side for me,
will you?

305
00:34:12,166 --> 00:34:15,775
Whatever the species might be,
if you let it alone, it won't bother you.

306
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:19,858
Maybe. But if you're wrong,
this harpoon will correct any mistakes.

307
00:34:20,281 --> 00:34:23,476
Mark, we're out for photographs for study,
not trophies.

308
00:34:23,568 --> 00:34:27,638
This... this thing alive and
in its natural habitat is valuable to us.

309
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:30,558
Why settle for a photo
when we can get the real thing?

310
00:34:30,643 --> 00:34:35,424
You don't sound like a scientist, but
like some big-game hunter out for the kill.

311
00:34:35,511 --> 00:34:39,416
We may not be back home, David,
but you're still working for me.

312
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:27,345
You didn't wait long enough
before coming up.

313
00:39:29,886 --> 00:39:34,004
- Why'd you shoot? You weren't attacked.
- You sound as if I'd harpooned <i>you.</i>

314
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:36,752
And why should we play tag
with this thing?

315
00:39:36,836 --> 00:39:39,155
We can learn more from it if it's alive.

316
00:39:39,249 --> 00:39:42,941
- Please! What is it you've found?
- I don't know what you'd call it.

317
00:39:43,036 --> 00:39:46,314
It sounds incredible, but...
it appeared to be human.

318
00:39:46,865 --> 00:39:51,315
I tell you, if it's what I think I saw,
it's the greatest find yet.

319
00:39:51,401 --> 00:39:54,679
- Nothing compares to it.
- And I've got the proof here in my lens.

320
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:05,507
Many years ago
I heard this legend on the river.

321
00:40:05,591 --> 00:40:08,786
A very old native tell me
of a man who live underwater.

322
00:40:08,878 --> 00:40:12,783
But she was crazy.
Crazy Goole, everybody call her.

323
00:40:12,873 --> 00:40:15,618
The unknown
always seems unbelievable, Lucas.

324
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:18,105
One accepts these things as legend.

325
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:22,484
But to actually believe there's a kind of
human being that can live underwater...

326
00:40:22,569 --> 00:40:25,811
This is no legend,
as you'll soon see for yourself.

327
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:29,638
What about the Kamongo? Science
hadn't heard of it until a few years ago.

328
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:32,212
And the Kamongo lived
way back in the Devonian age.

329
00:40:32,307 --> 00:40:36,047
Interesting that the fossil I found
was out of the same period.

330
00:40:36,135 --> 00:40:38,620
The Kamongo was a fish
that breathed air.

331
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:40,749
- What does that prove?
- Nothing.

332
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:45,157
Except that the Kamongo fish, which has
lungs, exists today here in the Amazon.

333
00:40:45,249 --> 00:40:47,367
It hasn't changed in millions of years.

334
00:40:47,454 --> 00:40:49,904
That doesn't prove
the possibility of a gill-man.

335
00:40:49,993 --> 00:40:55,188
If the evolution of that species reached
a dead end back then and still survived,

336
00:40:55,278 --> 00:40:57,312
why couldn't another?

337
00:41:00,188 --> 00:41:01,762
<i>(Dr Thompson)</i> Where is he?

338
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,045
I was sure I had him in my finder.

339
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:08,248
For a merman, he takes a fine picture.

340
00:41:08,344 --> 00:41:11,787
- This wasn't imagination, Doctor.
- I'm sorry, David.

341
00:41:11,881 --> 00:41:14,828
What proof do we have
if we never find it again?

342
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:18,954
If you hadn't stopped me, we could've
taken it. Dead or alive, what's it matter?

343
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,929
Aarghhh!

344
00:41:33,021 --> 00:41:34,677
<i>(splash)</i>

345
00:41:39,346 --> 00:41:41,582
- What happened?
- <i>(wailing)</i> Chico!

346
00:41:43,841 --> 00:41:45,745
- What happened?
- Zee!

347
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:47,909
- Chico... Chico...
- Zee!

348
00:41:49,916 --> 00:41:54,899
Chico is gone. My brother was dragged
down into the water by a demon!

349
00:41:54,993 --> 00:41:57,691
Come on, everybody, look around. Quick!

350
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:01,721
A demon, eh? Well, that's no more
far-fetched than your gill-man.

351
00:42:01,818 --> 00:42:04,516
There are many strange legends
in the Amazon.

352
00:42:04,606 --> 00:42:08,298
Even I - Lucas -
have heard the legend of a man-fish.

353
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,262
<i>(Dr Maia)</i> Over here! Quickly!

354
00:42:12,138 --> 00:42:13,593
Look!

355
00:42:24,331 --> 00:42:26,863
All right, Lucas. Start your pumps.

356
00:42:26,952 --> 00:42:28,821
Now all we have to do is catch him.

357
00:42:28,908 --> 00:42:32,316
- You'll never take it alive.
- I want to try, Mark.

358
00:42:32,404 --> 00:42:35,516
All right, David.
We can always do it my way.

359
00:42:35,608 --> 00:42:38,353
If we could just be sure of its reaction.

360
00:42:38,438 --> 00:42:41,929
Do you suppose it remembers
Mark's attack and seeks revenge?

361
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:43,637
I welcome it.

362
00:42:43,723 --> 00:42:45,794
You'll get your wish all right.

363
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:50,502
I've got a hunch this... this creature
remembers the past and more.

364
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:53,453
I don't want him creeping up on us
while we're sleeping.

365
00:42:53,543 --> 00:42:55,779
I know a way to bring him up now.

366
00:42:56,456 --> 00:43:01,651
Rotenone. A drug which the natives make
from roots for catching fish in still waters.

367
00:43:01,741 --> 00:43:04,651
Sometimes I catch fish that way.
I show you. Look.

368
00:43:06,652 --> 00:43:08,272
Excuse.

369
00:43:09,523 --> 00:43:12,387
One taste of the poisoned water

370
00:43:12,478 --> 00:43:15,969
and the paralysed fish
float up to the top with a big hangover.

371
00:43:16,056 --> 00:43:18,044
Well, come on, let's try it.

372
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:26,455
- Still no sign.
- Nothing but the little ones so far.

373
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:29,165
Could be he's dead from the wound.

374
00:44:29,255 --> 00:44:33,113
Then again, maybe the rotenone
isn't going deep enough.

375
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:37,409
Maybe we should fix the rotenone
to sink deeper down, eh?

376
00:44:37,494 --> 00:44:39,979
Yeah. Anything is worth a try.

377
00:45:24,310 --> 00:45:25,966
<i>(splash)</i>

378
00:45:29,636 --> 00:45:32,546
- What was that?
- I don't know.

379
00:45:36,253 --> 00:45:38,324
<i>(exotic bird calls)</i>

380
00:45:47,655 --> 00:45:49,643
Come on, come on.

381
00:45:50,734 --> 00:45:54,095
Are you talking to me, Mark,
or something out there?

382
00:45:54,188 --> 00:45:55,844
Both, David.

383
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,888
They won't believe it back home,
none of them.

384
00:45:59,973 --> 00:46:02,588
I wouldn't have believed it myself.

385
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,579
Sitting out here,
waiting for some monster to appear.

386
00:46:08,046 --> 00:46:10,199
That's why we've got to take him.

387
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:15,485
- Why won't they believe, Mark?
- Because we deal with known quantities.

388
00:46:15,578 --> 00:46:18,193
With knowledge
we've accumulated up to now.

389
00:46:18,283 --> 00:46:22,271
We've just begun to learn
about the water and its secrets.

390
00:46:22,361 --> 00:46:26,266
Just as we've only
touched on outer space.

391
00:46:26,356 --> 00:46:32,048
We don't entirely rule out the possibility
of some form of life on another planet.

392
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:35,465
Then why not
some entirely different form of life

393
00:46:35,552 --> 00:46:40,002
in a world we already know is inhabited
by millions of living creatures?

394
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:43,491
We must have the proof.

395
00:46:45,872 --> 00:46:47,492
<i>(animal howls)</i>

396
00:47:04,058 --> 00:47:06,543
<i>(animal howls)</i>

397
00:48:17,048 --> 00:48:18,076
Argh!

398
00:48:18,172 --> 00:48:19,959
<i>(growls)</i>

399
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:24,992
In the water!
The lantern frightened him off!

400
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:26,735
No.

401
00:48:39,727 --> 00:48:41,182
There he is!

402
00:48:41,517 --> 00:48:43,173
<i>(roars)</i>

403
00:48:53,543 --> 00:48:55,909
- It's foolish to go after him.
- But he's drugged.

404
00:48:55,998 --> 00:48:58,234
- I'd wait.
- If he has gills, he may suffocate.

405
00:48:58,329 --> 00:49:00,861
- How long does the effect last?
- Hour. Maybe two.

406
00:49:00,950 --> 00:49:02,772
But for that thing, who can tell?

407
00:49:02,865 --> 00:49:05,894
- Carl, follow me in a rowboat. Bring a net.
- I'll go with you.

408
00:49:05,986 --> 00:49:07,890
I keep you covered.

409
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,700
That's where he went under.

410
00:49:26,792 --> 00:49:29,194
I'm going to take a look. You wait here.

411
00:50:30,128 --> 00:50:32,032
- <i>(gasps)</i>
- Hey, take it easy.

412
00:50:32,126 --> 00:50:34,362
He went through here. Come on.

413
00:51:40,372 --> 00:51:42,028
Zee!

414
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:46,897

<i>(Kay screams)</i> No!

<i>(Kay sobs hysterically)</i>

00:52:11,582 --> 00:52:13,486
Oh, David! David!

421
00:52:14,537 --> 00:52:16,324
We got him.

422
00:52:16,743 --> 00:52:18,317
We got him!

423
00:52:19,156 --> 00:52:20,433
Don't kill him!

424
00:52:20,529 --> 00:52:22,979
- What happened?
- Give me the net.

425
00:52:23,068 --> 00:52:24,688
<i>(Kay sobs)</i>

426
00:52:29,643 --> 00:52:31,347
How is he?

427
00:52:31,932 --> 00:52:33,636
He's dead.

428
00:52:41,752 --> 00:52:43,870
<i>(David)</i> That's the last one.

429
00:52:47,079 --> 00:52:49,742
- Will he live?
- I don't know.

430
00:52:49,825 --> 00:52:53,233
If he can survive both the rotenone
and being out of the water so long.

431
00:52:53,321 --> 00:52:58,434
You sound as if you feel sorry for him.
He could have killed you just as easily.

432
00:52:58,523 --> 00:53:00,973
- But he didn't.
- It makes no difference now.

433
00:53:01,061 --> 00:53:03,262
The point is, he won't do any more killing.

434
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:07,504
- Well, Lucas, we can start back.
- Mark, we're not finished here yet.

435
00:53:07,594 --> 00:53:09,250
We've got to study that grotto.

436
00:53:09,342 --> 00:53:12,454
- Collect photographs, data.
- I've got all the proof I need.

437
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:16,486
- Get going, Lucas.
- We're not going until we finish our work.

438
00:53:23,532 --> 00:53:26,774
All right, David,
if it'll make you feel any better.

439
00:53:26,862 --> 00:53:31,016
Oh, Doctor, would you mind staying
behind and keep an eye on our prize?

440
00:53:31,106 --> 00:53:33,389
<i>(Kay)</i> Don't be long, David.

441
00:53:34,768 --> 00:53:36,424
You'd better get some rest.

442
00:54:58,412 --> 00:55:00,116
<i>(door clatters)</i>

443
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,566
- Hi.
- Oh.

444
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,677
Thought I'd come up and get some air.

445
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,007
What do you suppose
is taking them so long?

446
00:55:16,097 --> 00:55:18,250
David's very thorough.

447
00:55:18,761 --> 00:55:21,163
But shouldn't you be resting, Kay?

448
00:55:21,257 --> 00:55:23,623
- I couldn't sleep.
- <i>(animals howl)</i>

449
00:55:24,462 --> 00:55:27,621
- Listen to the sounds.
- Hunting calls, mostly.

450
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,327
Animals out for the kill.

451
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:35,146
<i>(Kay)</i> Some of them are cries of fear,
like people who whistle in the dark.

452
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:37,606
I'm not exactly blind, Kay.

453
00:55:37,695 --> 00:55:41,518
You're worried about what's happened
between Mark and David.

454
00:55:41,607 --> 00:55:46,175
But once you admit the simple fact
that you're in love, which you have,

455
00:55:46,267 --> 00:55:49,047
then it becomes a good idea
to be the scientist about it.

456
00:55:49,139 --> 00:55:52,298
- <i>(Kay)</i> It's not as easy as that.
- Why not?

457
00:55:52,384 --> 00:55:56,585
<i>(Kay)</i> If it weren't for Mark Williams,
I wouldn't have my work, or even a job.

458
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:59,996
<i>(Dr Thompson)</i> It's true
he helped train you and gave you a job,

459
00:56:00,083 --> 00:56:02,698
but he needed you
just as much as you needed him.

460
00:56:03,038 --> 00:56:07,192
- You're oversimplifying.
- You've repaid him many times over.

461
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:11,649
A good part of his present position at the
institute is due to your valuable research.

462
00:56:11,735 --> 00:56:14,930
- And another thing...
- <i>(growl)</i>

463
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:17,552
Get back, Kay!

464
00:56:18,102 --> 00:56:19,758
<i>(creature roars)</i>

00:56:20,848 --> 00:56:22,504
Go on, get back!

<i>(screaming)</i> No! No!

467
00:56:30,669 --> 00:56:32,325
<i>(creature howls)</i>

468
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:39,815
Dr Thompson!

469
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:42,728
<i>(groans)</i>

470
00:57:14,363 --> 00:57:16,232
How is he?

471
00:57:17,068 --> 00:57:20,062
If infection doesn't set in,
he may pull through.

472
00:57:20,148 --> 00:57:23,591
The fool. It wouldn't have happened
if he hadn't been careless.

473
00:57:23,685 --> 00:57:25,554
There's no one to blame.

474
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:28,173
Four men dead so far.

475
00:57:28,262 --> 00:57:32,332
And if he dies, what a useless waste
of experience and ability.

476
00:57:33,173 --> 00:57:35,788
Nobody meant it to happen, David.

477
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:43,734
Mark, I'm for getting out of this lagoon
just as fast as we can.

478
00:57:43,826 --> 00:57:45,530
Without taking what we came for?

479
00:57:45,615 --> 00:57:50,065
We didn't come here to fight monsters.
We came here to find fossils.

480
00:57:50,151 --> 00:57:53,346
Later we can come back
with a properly equipped expedition.

481
00:57:53,439 --> 00:57:55,675
- Be reasonable!
- Reasonable?

482
00:57:56,476 --> 00:57:58,547
Oh, what else could I expect?

483
00:57:58,640 --> 00:58:01,338
But you, Carl. It means as much to you.

484
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:05,203
You're driving yourself too hard,
and the rest of us along with you.

485
00:58:05,298 --> 00:58:09,416
- We're staying until we get him.
- Or until somebody else gets killed?

486
00:58:09,501 --> 00:58:10,991
No, we're not.

487
00:58:11,083 --> 00:58:14,361
Lucas? We're getting out of here
just as fast as we can.

488
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,685
I'll make the decisions around here.

489
00:58:19,780 --> 00:58:24,312
But you are wrong, Mr Williams. On the
water, the <i>capitão</i> makes the decisions.

490
00:58:24,399 --> 00:58:26,303
We will do as you say.

491
00:58:26,397 --> 00:58:28,349
You'll listen to <i>me.</i>

492
00:58:30,641 --> 00:58:33,421
You wish to say something, mister? Eh?

493
00:58:35,385 --> 00:58:38,414
Dr Maia, would you please
to pull up the anchor?

494
00:58:38,506 --> 00:58:40,577
I will start the engine.

495
00:59:28,609 --> 00:59:31,437
Look out! There's something here!
Look out!

496
00:59:31,522 --> 00:59:32,929
Look out!

497
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:36,014
Pull back! There's something here!

498
00:59:36,349 --> 00:59:39,426
- Put it in reverse!
- Pull back! Pull back!

499
00:59:45,338 --> 00:59:47,953
<i>(Lucas)</i> Nothing was there
when we came in.

500
00:59:48,375 --> 00:59:51,285
It was put there
to keep us from getting out.

501
00:59:51,372 --> 00:59:52,697
By him.

502
00:59:52,786 --> 00:59:56,277
- I check below for damage.
- I'll go aft and keep watch.

503
00:59:56,365 --> 00:59:58,648
You'd better stay with Thompson.

504
01:00:00,069 --> 01:00:04,009
It's our last chance to get the proof.
You can see for yourself it's still here!

505
01:00:04,105 --> 01:00:08,720
We're fighting for our lives, and
you're worried people won't believe us?

506
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:11,044
- Is all right down below.
- <i>(splash)</i>

<i>(gunshot)</i>

508
01:00:19,253 --> 01:00:23,288
- Go in the cabin and lock the door.
- No, stay here with us. You're safer.

509
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:27,324
- Lucas. Lucas, start your winch.
- Hm?

510
01:00:27,409 --> 01:00:29,692
Go on, go on. Start your winch.

511
01:00:35,024 --> 01:00:36,893
Up an inch!

512
01:00:38,353 --> 01:00:40,009
Hold it!

513
01:00:42,515 --> 01:00:44,668
All right, give me some slack.

514
01:00:46,426 --> 01:00:48,709
A little more.

515
01:00:48,798 --> 01:00:50,502
Whoa!

516
01:00:51,670 --> 01:00:53,741
Take it away.

517
01:00:54,749 --> 01:00:57,529
Easy. A little more. Whoa.

518
01:01:13,059 --> 01:01:15,969
Take it away. Take it up.

519
01:01:16,055 --> 01:01:17,842
More. More.

520
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:20,957
Hold it.

521
01:01:23,296 --> 01:01:25,284
All right, take it away.

522
01:01:26,542 --> 01:01:28,198

She must have slipped.

- We'll just have to try it again.
- How, David?

527
01:02:15,937 --> 01:02:18,055
I'll have to use the aqualung.

528
01:02:20,931 --> 01:02:23,002
I'm going to help him.

529
01:02:32,624 --> 01:02:34,280
I'm going in with you.

530
01:02:34,372 --> 01:02:38,573
All we're interested in right now is getting
the entrance to this lagoon cleared.

531
01:02:38,658 --> 01:02:42,101
- I'll be the bait for him.
- Oh, Mark. Get out of my way.

532
01:02:42,196 --> 01:02:44,811
Let it come for me.
It'll give you a chance to get at him.

533
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:48,592
- You're crazy.
- To want to make the biggest find ever?

534
01:02:48,687 --> 01:02:51,053
You don't know what this can mean!
To all of us!

535
01:02:51,143 --> 01:02:54,137
- Mark, you're not going with me.
- I am.

536
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,800
Thank you, Carl.
Lucas, stand by the winch.

537
01:03:30,884 --> 01:03:32,955
Carl, stand by that cable.

538
01:07:45,850 --> 01:07:47,506
<i>(screams)</i>

539
01:08:23,095 --> 01:08:27,165
It's the only way.
We've got to clear this inlet.

540
01:08:27,256 --> 01:08:32,156
Hey, that fellow down there, you think
he's a mosquito you can shoo away?

541
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:36,782
- We've got to take that chance.
- Sure! An expedition needs <i>two</i> martyrs.

542
01:08:36,869 --> 01:08:39,436
Kay, Kay! I'm doing
the only thing we can do.

543
01:08:39,532 --> 01:08:42,940
If we all just sit here,
we'll all end up as Mark did!

544
01:08:44,859 --> 01:08:50,220
Wait a minute. Something you just said,
about his... not being a mosquito.

545
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:53,304
Maybe we won't have to fight him
on his own terms after all.

546
01:08:53,389 --> 01:08:56,004
- How much rotenone have we got left?
- Not enough.

547
01:08:56,094 --> 01:08:58,247
Enough to use in a spray gun?

548
01:08:58,341 --> 01:08:59,831
What?

549
01:08:59,923 --> 01:09:02,787
Oh! You mean to kill like a mosquito, eh?

550
01:09:02,877 --> 01:09:05,871
- It worked for us before.
- And it took plenty of time.

551
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:07,744
All we want is to make him groggy.

552
01:09:07,829 --> 01:09:11,355
Just keep him away long enough
so I can get a cable around that tree.

553
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,521
What do we use for the spray gun?

554
01:09:13,614 --> 01:09:15,566
One of the air bottles.

555
01:09:15,653 --> 01:09:19,558
A solution of rotenone released
under pressure. That ought to do the trick!

556
01:09:19,689 --> 01:09:21,925
- Some trick!
- Come on.

557
01:09:23,351 --> 01:09:25,587
- Lucas, you stand guard.
- Yes.
