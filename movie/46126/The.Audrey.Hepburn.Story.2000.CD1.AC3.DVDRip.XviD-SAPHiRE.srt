00:00:32,465 --> 00:00:36,424
- How you doin' back there?
- I'm scared, if you want the truth.

2
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,266
- You just gotta believe in yourself.
- Thank you,Jimmy.

3
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:43,433
If l don't get this right, they're going
to make me drive the taxi instead.

4
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,909
You can do it.

5
00:01:14,374 --> 00:01:16,433
- Cut!
- That's a cut!

6
00:01:17,644 --> 00:01:20,135
Look what I've done!

7
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,272
Blake, darling, it's hopeless.

8
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:24,782
You will get it.

9
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,011
Can I please have
an ice cream cone?

10
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,817
It's called
Breakfast At Tiffany's, Audrey.

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:34,155
- Nobody eats ice cream for breakfast.
- Well, I do.

12
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:37,195
Please. Please don't make me
eat the pastry.

13
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:41,734
I'll tell you what.
We will get you one without sugar.

14
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,497
- All right.
- Be right back.

15
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:47,162
I'm so sorry.

16
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,843
See why I didn't want Hepburn
for this?

17
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,914
She can't eat, that's why.

18
00:01:55,014 --> 00:01:59,314
Marilyn Monroe is who I wanted.
Marilyn Monroe knows how to eat.

19
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:01,910
Audrey's the nicest star
I ever worked with.

20
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:04,387
I don't write " nice."

21
00:02:07,861 --> 00:02:10,921
- He doesn't like me.
- He doesn't like anybody.

22
00:02:11,030 --> 00:02:13,521
Maybe I should tell him
I like his books.

23
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,658
I do. He's a wonderful writer.

24
00:02:15,768 --> 00:02:19,704
- What do you care what he thinks?
- Because I'd like to make him smile.

25
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,468
If l can make him smile,
will you give me a quarter?

26
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:27,444
If you can make Truman Capote smile,
I'll give you a standing ovation.

27
00:02:27,547 --> 00:02:30,448
Well, then it's a bet.

28
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,075
- Excuse me, Audrey. Places.
- Yes.

29
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:34,517
Places!

30
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,391
Audrey! Audrey?

31
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,240
Audrey, where are you?

32
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,909
What happened to the sugar buns?

33
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:09,386
What happened to them?

34
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,687
She shouldn't be eating sweets.

35
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,652
Neither should you.
  
36
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,162
If you don't care
about your own appearance...

37
00:03:18,264 --> 00:03:20,664
think about the terrible example
you're setting for Audrey.

38
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:24,669
You're hardly here. How could you
know what's good for Audrey?

39
00:03:24,771 --> 00:03:27,865
What kind of example
are you setting? Joseph!

40
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:30,704
You spend more time with your secretary
than with your family.

41
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:33,176
- I'm tired of this talk, Ella.
- I'm tired of your behavior.

42
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,837
Leave me alone!

43
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,987
Here she is.
Come out of there, darling.

44
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,335
- What have you done now?
- This is no place for us.

45
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,733
Come on.

46
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,020
Forgive me, Audrey.

47
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,092
I had some bank business
to take care of.

48
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,683
Would you dance with me, Father?

49
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,482
And where do you think
you're going this time?

50
00:05:19,585 --> 00:05:22,816
- London.
- To have your mother support you again?

51
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:24,822
Can we talk about this later?

52
00:05:24,924 --> 00:05:27,290
I expected you to run off
to Germany by now.

53
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:31,287
I have been asked to head
the European Press Institute.

54
00:05:31,397 --> 00:05:34,264
What do they do?
Distribute Nazi propaganda?

55
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:36,597
Information is not propaganda.

56
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,934
You're on the wrong side
of everything, aren't you?

57
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,966
Please don't leave us.

58
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:46,204
You're supposed to protect us.
We have a daughter.

59
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:49,213
I'm not letting you go.
You can't go!

60
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:51,306
Leave it alone!

61
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:53,681
Joseph, you can't go! Please!

62
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,845
Don't try to stop me.

63
00:05:58,291 --> 00:05:59,758
Joseph!

64
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,666
Please don't leave us, Father!

65
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,869
Father! Father!

66
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:34,122
When you're ready, first positions.
First positions.

67
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,694
First positions!

68
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,595
Thank you, darling.
You're so good to me.

69
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,225
- How's your little girl?
- My princess?

70
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,134
She got a birthday coming up.
Know what she wants to do?

71
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,298
She wants to go to a Yankee game.

72
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,467
I didn't know she liked baseball.

73
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,238
I don't think she does,
but she knows I do.

74
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:55,576
It'll just be the two of us
at the game.

75
00:06:55,681 --> 00:07:00,084
Me and my princess screaming
our lungs out on the third baseline.

76
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,416
Is she coming back
to the set today?

77
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,921
She's already here.

78
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:06,423
She woke up at 5:00
to be with me today.

79
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:10,223
You know what she said this morning?
She wants to grow up to be like you.

80
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,230
Just don't let her grow up
to be as nervous as I am.

81
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,823
- Places!
- Here we go.

82
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,926
Here we go.

83
00:07:18,037 --> 00:07:20,005
Thank you. Thank you.

84
00:07:28,481 --> 00:07:30,381
You're supposed to be packing.

85
00:07:32,752 --> 00:07:34,720
I don't want to go.

86
00:07:36,923 --> 00:07:38,948
Did Father say I had to go?

87
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,856
Your father has nothing to say
about your education.

88
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:45,260
Or anything else,
for that matter.

89
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:49,698
A man who hasn't called his daughter
in five years doesn't have a say.

90
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:52,066
Maybe he's angry
that I haven't called him.

91
00:07:52,171 --> 00:07:55,629
Boarding school will be
very good for you, darling.

92
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,905
You'll learn manners,
independence and proper English.

93
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:07,417
Can I live with Father in London?

94
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,718
You'll live at the school, dear.

95
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:13,815
Your father will come to visit you
whenever he can.

96
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,930
How will he know where I am?
How can you tell him to see me...

97
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:21,329
if you don't know where he is?

98
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,368
You don't know anything about him.

99
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:26,461
Audrey, I don't understand
his silence either...

100
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:29,405
but I know it has nothing
to do with you.

101
00:08:58,137 --> 00:08:59,866
When will I see you?

102
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:03,032
Will you come collect me
for holidays?

103
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,475
Audrey, the simple truth is...

104
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:09,946
we can't afford for me to come back
and forth as often as I'd like...

105
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,176
now that I've moved back
to Holland.

106
00:09:12,285 --> 00:09:15,277
I'm sure one of your classmates
will invite you to London...

107
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,686
for Easter and the like, hmm?

108
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,781
Good afternoon, Baroness.

109
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,383
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Audrey.

110
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:24,793
Good afternoon, Miss Rigden.

111
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:27,127
I trust you're not too tired
after your trip.

112
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,602
Let's get you settled, then.

113
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,773
Hello.

114
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,478
I'm Clara.

115
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,310
How do you do?

116
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,976
I'm Audrey Hepburn.

117
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,985
I have to go to dance class.

118
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,317
Don't let me keep you.

119
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,357
I'll just get settled and--

120
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:53,686
Are you a dancer?

121
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:57,154
I'm not anything that I know of.

122
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:17,408
Isn't it beautiful?

123
00:10:17,516 --> 00:10:19,450
Do you study dance here?

124
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,349
Of course I do.

125
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,853
Everyone does.

126
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:33,555
It is beautiful.

127
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:36,635
We'll begin with pliés
in first position.

128
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,216
Hello, operator.

129
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,720
Do you have a listing in London
for a Joseph Hepburn?

130
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,599
You have a Joseph Hepburn
living there?

131
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:13,160
Joseph Hepburn who used
to live in Brussels?

132
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,833
I'm his daughter.
Could I leave a message for him, please?

133
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,311
My father is there?
May I speak with him, please?

134
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,085
I see.

135
00:11:38,264 --> 00:11:42,325
Your father was there,
and he didn't want to talk to you?

136
00:11:42,435 --> 00:11:47,270
They said he couldn't speak
at the moment and would call me back...

137
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,863
but he hasn't.

138
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:54,005
I think you're lucky
not seeing your parents.

139
00:11:54,113 --> 00:11:56,274
All they do is complain, anyway...

140
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:59,112
and tell you
how unacceptable you are.

141
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:03,614
My mother doesn't do that.

142
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,658
She tells me
I can be anything I want.

143
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:11,086
I wish I had my parents
in a glass case...

144
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:13,188
Iike in a wax museum...

145
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:17,201
all dressed up to go out,
but never going anywhere ever again.

146
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,272
If I ever get married,
I'm going to marry...

147
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,535
a man with beautiful hair...

148
00:12:24,643 --> 00:12:27,373
who looks marvelous in his tuxedo...

149
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,246
and is utterly devoted
to me and the children.

150
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,717
I'm going to have two children.
One isn't enough.

151
00:12:35,654 --> 00:12:39,647
I think being a mother must be
the best thing in all the world.

152
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,217
I'm going to let my girls
climb in bed with me...

153
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,887
whenever they want.

154
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:48,996
And one day...

155
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,160
our father will come home...

156
00:12:53,873 --> 00:12:56,273
and we'll be so happy.

157
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,254
Very good, girls.

158
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,352
That was lovely, Audrey.

159
00:13:18,697 --> 00:13:21,791
Could I speak with you
a moment, please?

160
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:23,960
Of course.

161
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,900
Ready, girls? And--

162
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:34,770
I have just received
this note from your mother.

163
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,475
After conferring with your Uncle Willem,
she is taking you out of school.

164
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:42,076
Now that France and England
have declared war on Germany...

165
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,088
she wants you with her in Holland.

166
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,090
But if there is a war...

167
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:48,558
wouldn't we be safer here
than in Holland?

168
00:13:49,395 --> 00:13:51,420
" Holland is a neutral country.

169
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,430
My cousin is a cabinet minister.

170
00:13:53,532 --> 00:13:56,092
He assures me that we
will not enter the war...

171
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:58,670
even if England is leveled
by the bombing."

172
00:13:58,771 --> 00:14:01,262
Do I have to leave?

173
00:14:01,373 --> 00:14:02,897
I'm afraid so.

174
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,341
Your mother has already been
in touch with your father.

175
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,414
He'll meet you at the airport
and put you on the plane.

176
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,744
My father?

177
00:14:14,119 --> 00:14:15,518
When do I leave?

178
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,918
Tomorrow.

179
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,585
British European Airways
is pleased to announce the arrival....

180
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,323
of flight 23 from Paris.

181
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,399
Have you ever been to Holland?

182
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,662
Mother says they grow
the most beautiful flowers there.

183
00:14:30,769 --> 00:14:33,465
Please continue
your dancing, Audrey.

184
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:37,633
It's very important not to stop
at this stage in your development.

185
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,276
There he is. Father!

186
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,012
Paging passenger Orlens.

187
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,281
Please report
to the information counter.

188
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,021
You're all grown up.

189
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,954
I've thought of you every day.

190
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,562
I didn't realize
how long it had been.

191
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:10,070
Why didn't you visit me
at school, Father?

192
00:15:10,175 --> 00:15:12,166
I meant to, of course, but--

193
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,246
I'm sorry we couldn't have seen
each other under better circumstances.

194
00:15:25,724 --> 00:15:28,056
I am a British subject, yes.

195
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,651
I don't see why my papers
should be necessary.

196
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,061
Ladies and gentlemen,
flight 61 to Amsterdam...

197
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,065
is now boarding.

198
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,067
Is there a problem?
They're calling her flight.

199
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:41,162
Your daughter may board the flight,
but we have a few questions for you.

200
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:44,333
Any persons holding tickets
for flight 61 to Amsterdam...

201
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,070
please report to gate five.

202
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:50,681
After the war,
things will be better.

203
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,250
We'll see each other then.

204
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:54,012
Miss?

205
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:56,110
Time for you to go.

206
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,757
I love you so much, Father.

207
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,936
Good-bye, princess.

208
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:21,977
This will be the final call
for flight 61 to Amsterdam.

209
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:24,743
All passengers,
please proceed to gate five.

210
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,211
Come along now, sir.

211
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,380
Don't make any trouble, sir.

212
00:17:09,395 --> 00:17:12,057
I 'll get you,
Mr. Frown-all-the-time.

213
00:17:46,865 --> 00:17:47,490
Cut!

214
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,534
And let's print that!

215
00:17:50,636 --> 00:17:52,297
- It was perfect.
- Thank you.

216
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,599
- You did it!
- Did he see it?

217
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:56,298
- Where did he go?
- Who?

218
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,308
Truman Capote, of course.

219
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,640
I don't know
what you're worried about.

220
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,977
I just don't want to disappoint you.
I don't want to let you down.

221
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,211
Audrey, that would be impossible.

222
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,480
You were beautiful.

223
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,146
Thank you.

224
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:15,724
- You remember my daughter Irene?
- Of course.

225
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,058
These are for you.
I chose them myself.

226
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,994
Thank you, darling.
They're beautiful.

227
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,167
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

228
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,259
- You're welcome.
- Thank you.

229
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,674
In an act of unprecedented
and undeserved hostility...

230
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,810
the army of the Third Reich
has invaded Holland...

231
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,478
taking the entire country captive.

232
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,490
Radio Free Netherlands reports
that the Dutch queen Wilhelmina...

233
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:48,822
after strong recommendations
from her advisors...

234
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:50,986
boarded ship for London
this morning.

235
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:52,654
Over the past two weeks...

236
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,322
battalions of German soldiers...

237
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:56,663
have occupied several cities,
including--

238
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:06,134
You said Germany
would never invade Holland.

239
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:08,873
I thought we would be safer here.

240
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,380
I was wrong.

241
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,042
There is no safe place
while this monster is alive.

242
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,052
What about my ballet lessons?

243
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,554
Will we have to stay inside
until the war is over?

244
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,454
I'm not staying inside,
I can tell you that much.

245
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,787
No.

246
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,161
Your Uncle Willem is right.

247
00:19:26,265 --> 00:19:28,631
In time, things will get easier.

248
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:31,862
We'll be able to move
around the city.

249
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:36,066
Wejust have to obey the Germans
till they feel they're in control.

250
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,745
All over Holland,
there are small rooms like this...

251
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,585
where artists are painting
and writing...

252
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,149
and dreaming of the world
after the war.

253
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:57,387
And.

254
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,634
And three and four.

255
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:05,669
Plié.

256
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:08,604
Tendu. Plié.

257
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,038
Here you are, Hannah.

258
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,769
Thank you.

259
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:17,847
And grand plié.

260
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,950
And one...

261
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,755
and two.

262
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:32,261
Three and four.

263
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,367
We continue to strengthen
our underground operations...

264
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:43,771
to disrupt enemy troop movements.

265
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:46,139
Will there be
any flour this week?

266
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:50,375
There will, but we are destroying it
at the border.

267
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,384
The last thing we want to do
is feed the Germans...

268
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:57,387
even if it means
starving ourselves.

269
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,897
God protect you, Hannah.

270
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,543
Mother.

271
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,708
Mother?

272
00:22:00,452 --> 00:22:02,181
What's wrong?

273
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,153
Is it Father?

274
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:07,690
What's wrong?

275
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,561
It's Uncle Willem.

276
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,428
What happened?

277
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:22,000
A train carrying German soldiers
was blown up by the Resistance.

278
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:26,243
The Gestapo suspected your Uncle Willem
had something to do with it...

279
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:29,314
so they arrested him
and five others...

280
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,143
and shot them.

281
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:35,977
Uncle Willem.

282
00:22:41,259 --> 00:22:43,193
I'm so sorry, Mother.

283
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:53,499
Good evening, friends.

284
00:22:55,006 --> 00:22:57,236
Thank you for your efforts...

285
00:22:57,342 --> 00:22:59,242
during this difficult period.

286
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,945
The retaliation for the destruction
of the troop train continues.

287
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,780
It is therefore critical that we alert
our supporters outside of town...

288
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,822
that raids on civilian homes
are continuing without warning.

289
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:13,823
I have repaired
the printing press.

290
00:23:13,925 --> 00:23:16,325
The material will be ready
by tomorrow.

291
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:19,522
Good. We need someone new
to deliver our message.

292
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,360
We can provide a bicycle...

293
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:24,196
but it will have to be someone
whose presence will not be--

294
00:23:24,302 --> 00:23:26,395
I will do it.

295
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:31,138
I want to help.

296
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:35,502
Ella?

297
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:56,050
Miss? Come quickly.

298
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,459
I have another job for you.

299
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:25,245
To market, to market...

300
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:27,552
to buy a fat pig.

301
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:30,719
Home again, home again,
jiggety--

302
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,899
jig.

303
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:45,306
London Bridge is falling down

304
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:47,105
Falling down

305
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,953
My fair lady

306
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,660
I have a message for you.

307
00:26:07,766 --> 00:26:11,463
Tonight, at midnight,
go to the bend in the stream.

308
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,800
Then cross out to the marsh.

309
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,175
The raft will be waiting there.

310
00:26:19,277 --> 00:26:20,505
Thank you.

311
00:26:21,846 --> 00:26:23,973
You're welcome.

312
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,481
Be careful.

313
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,251
You too.

314
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,746
- Do you live here?
- No.

315
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:09,282
- What were you doing in the woods?
- I went to meet my boyfriend.

316
00:27:09,394 --> 00:27:11,692
And what did you do
with that boy?

317
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,629
He didn't come.

318
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:18,794
He doesn't love me.

319
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,803
Please...

320
00:27:22,907 --> 00:27:24,306
take these.

321
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,811
Your girlfriend will like them.

322
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,312
Thank you.

323
00:29:14,185 --> 00:29:17,677
Maybe she's at the ballet studio
or the school.

324
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:20,019
I've been up all night
waiting for her!

325
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:22,116
Please, go home, Ella.

326
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,060
Our people are looking for Audrey.
They know what they're doing.

327
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,222
I can't stay inside any longer.

328
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:30,267
You think the Germans keep
their prisoners on the street corner...

329
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,734
for their families to claim them?

330
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,431
- I just can't--
- No, they don't.

331
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,838
They just wait for their families
to come looking...

332
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,842
and then they capture them too.

333
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,504
Now, go home, and stay there...

334
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:44,605
so she has someone to come home to.

335
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:13,627
I thought you were--

336
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:15,137
You're burning up.

337
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,707
Mother.

338
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:26,415
German troops have retreated
across the border in disarray.

339
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:29,077
Sources in London indicate
the Dutch queen Wilhelmina...

340
00:31:29,187 --> 00:31:31,747
will return to Amsterdam
early next week.

341
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:35,019
Until then, Maastricht will serve
as the center of government...

342
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:37,993
as Allied relief forces
begin to filter across Holland.

343
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:41,088
This is BBC London calling.

344
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:46,001
- What is it, Mother?
- I think you'd better come see.

345
00:31:56,748 --> 00:32:00,616
Never in the field of human conflict....

346
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:02,811
was so much owed by so many...

347
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,582
to so few.

348
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,827
You've saved us.

349
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,463
What's an English girl doing here?

350
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,206
Do you like chocolate?

351
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:29,470
Chocolate? I adore it!

352
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,744
And we'll be showing a film later
in the square, if you'd like to come.

353
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,648
We'd love to.
Thank you.

354
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:44,423
Darling, you shouldn't be eating
this chocolate.

355
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,690
I don't--
I don't feel so well.

356
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,356
Come inside.

357
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:52,793
She has anemia, asthma...

358
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,633
and acute colitis.

359
00:32:54,739 --> 00:32:58,106
All these suggest
very serious infection.

360
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:00,006
She needs penicillin.

361
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,509
Can't we send for it
from Amsterdam?

362
00:33:03,614 --> 00:33:05,775
She can't wait that long.

363
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:35,745
Moon River

364
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:39,647
Wider than a mile

365
00:33:39,751 --> 00:33:43,312
I'm crossing you in style

366
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:47,187
Someday

367
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:51,250
- Oh, dream maker
- Where'd all this chocolate come from?

368
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:54,092
I've never seen so much chocolate
on a set before.

369
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,098
Audrey buys it for the crew.

370
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:59,431
"You can never have too much chocolate."
That's what she always says.

371
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,870
- What are we shooting next?
- The song on the balcony.

372
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:06,034
Do you believe this?
They gave her a damn song!

373
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:08,203
Call girls don't sing.

374
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,872
She doesn't seem
like a call girl to me.

375
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,007
She was in my book.

376
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:16,678
There's such a lot of world

377
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:19,780
To see

378
00:34:21,192 --> 00:34:25,128
We're after

379
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,130
The same

380
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:32,726
Rainbow's end

381
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,773
Waiting round the bend

382
00:34:36,874 --> 00:34:40,537
My huckleberry friend

383
00:34:40,645 --> 00:34:46,106
Moon River

384
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,778
And me

385
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,423
Are you sure
you want me to sing?

386
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:00,463
Of course I 'm sure.

387
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:02,829
- Aren't you?
- I suppose so.

388
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:06,233
After all, I didn't know how to do
half the things I did in my life.

389
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:08,237
Shall we get to work?

390
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:29,015
How many girls is she taking?
Do you know?

391
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,426
Kay Kendall.
I haven't seen you around.

392
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:35,465
I'd like to talk,
but I can't do two things at once.

393
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:39,400
If Madame Rambert doesn't like me,
I don't know what I'll do.

394
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:46,938
Sorry. Audrey Hepburn.

395
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,410
- How do you do?
- Are you from London?

396
00:35:49,514 --> 00:35:51,880
No. I just arrived last week.

397
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,679
Some of us gypsy types
are going for a coffee later...

398
00:35:54,785 --> 00:35:56,184
if you feel like it.

399
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,221
I don't know what that is.

400
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,415
Gypsies or coffee?

401
00:36:17,308 --> 00:36:20,141
We will have
the first combination, please.

402
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,433
You were in Holland for the war?
Why?

403
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,435
My mother's Dutch.

404
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,698
Was it very difficult there?

405
00:36:48,806 --> 00:36:51,331
Yes, but my mother
pulled us through it.

406
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,910
I was very sick at the end of the war,
and she got cigarettes...

407
00:36:54,011 --> 00:36:57,742
from the English soldiers and traded
them on the black market for penicillin.

408
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:00,817
- She was very brave.
- And very clever.

409
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:02,476
She saved my life.

410
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,182
She sacrificed so much that I
could come to London to study dance.

411
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:10,522
If you need some quick money,
you can always do revues in nightclubs.

412
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,789
Or do chorus parts in musicals.

413
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,832
That's what a gypsy is--
a dancer in a musical.

414
00:37:15,933 --> 00:37:18,458
I don't want to dance in musicals.

415
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,799
I don't know how to do
that kind of dancing, anyway.

416
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,806
You want to be a prima ballerina.

417
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,638
Anything else? Do you want to be rich?
Do you want to be queen?

418
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,812
I know it sounds impossible...

419
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,814
but I'd like to be a great dancer...

420
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,407
and then retire, get married
and have children.

421
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:36,645
Dancers don't have children.

422
00:37:37,855 --> 00:37:40,380
And I'd like to find my father.

423
00:37:40,491 --> 00:37:43,483
He's somewhere here in England,
I think.

424
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:46,461
If I could just dance
somewhere important...

425
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,727
- Like Covent Garden?
- maybe he'd come to see me.

426
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,893
Oh, baby...

427
00:37:52,003 --> 00:37:54,972
you are the biggest dreamer
I ever met.

428
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,302
We need to get you a boyfriend.

429
00:38:15,092 --> 00:38:18,152
I know I lost a lot of time
not dancing during the war.

430
00:38:18,262 --> 00:38:20,321
I don't know if you can catch up.

431
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,767
Please, give me a chance.

432
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:26,200
If you had to, would you
give up everything to dance?

433
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:30,872
- I couldn't give up my mother.
- You wouldn't have to.

434
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,875
And I want to have children...

435
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:36,435
but I can have children
when I'm too old to dance.

436
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:40,278
Your teacher in Holland
has written me about your situation.

437
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,148
And since she recommends you
so highly...

438
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:45,154
I will give you a chance.

439
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:49,587
But it will not be on full scholarship,
as you have asked.

440
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,889
It will be
very difficult for you...

441
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,123
but if i don't give you
the chance...

442
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:57,928
then the war has triumphed over
the dance, and we can't allow that.

443
00:38:58,035 --> 00:39:00,128
Thank you.

444
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,570
I just don't know
if I'm good enough.

445
00:39:38,676 --> 00:39:43,204
I'm not dancing very well lately,
and the other girls are so beautiful.

446
00:39:43,314 --> 00:39:46,215
If it isn't dance,
it'll be something else.

447
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:48,046
No.

448
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:50,211
No, it has to be dance.

449
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,221
It's my life.

450
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:56,623
Wasn't there ever anything that you
wanted more than anything in the world?

451
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:59,855
I wanted you.
Does that count?

452
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:02,228
I'm only happy when I'm dancing.

453
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:05,393
It's the only time I'm not nervous
about what to do with my hands...

454
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:08,404
or whether I remember
everyone's name.

455
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,134
Audrey, you are
a beautiful dancer.

456
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,005
You have worked very hard...

457
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,510
and I'm very proud
of what you've accomplished.

458
00:40:15,613 --> 00:40:17,547
That isn't what I'm saying.

459
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,379
What I mean is...

460
00:40:21,485 --> 00:40:24,977
sometimes life has other ideas
about what we should do.

461
00:40:26,223 --> 00:40:30,125
Take me, for example.
I am a baroness working in a restaurant.

462
00:40:31,061 --> 00:40:33,029
It wouldn't have been my idea...

463
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,894
but I do feel very peaceful here.

464
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,494
You've made it look so much better.

465
00:40:41,639 --> 00:40:44,540
What does Madame Rambert
think about your dancing?

466
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,471
I don't know.

467
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:50,813
I'm afraid to ask her.

468
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,881
I have been watching you
very carefully, Audrey...

469
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,752
and I regret to tell you...

470
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:32,618
that you have neither the stature
nor the talent...

471
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:35,248
to achieve success
as a prima ballerina.

472
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:40,127
I see.

473
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:54,706
Thank you...

474
00:41:54,812 --> 00:41:57,542
for letting me study with you...

475
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:00,048
and thank you
for telling me the truth.

476
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:28,311
Over here.

477
00:42:29,914 --> 00:42:32,246
Oh, this isn't working.

478
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:34,408
Your jaw is so long.

479
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:36,418
Tuck your chin down a little.

480
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,921
I know I don't look
like the other girls.

481
00:42:40,024 --> 00:42:42,288
All right.

482
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,055
Your features
are very distinct.

483
00:42:45,162 --> 00:42:48,620
Your eyes are almost--
Were your parents Asian?

484
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:50,131
No.

485
00:42:51,802 --> 00:42:53,702
Over here. Down--

486
00:42:53,804 --> 00:42:56,796
Over here. Down a little.
Relax your eyes.

487
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:59,808
Let's try and take
a picture now, shall we?

488
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,639
Hold that.

489
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,480
Smile, please.

490
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,979
This isn't going to work.

491
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,485
Where are you going?

492
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,818
To do something else,
anything else.

493
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:31,731
All right. Singing will be next.
Back in five minutes, please.

494
00:43:31,842 --> 00:43:33,241
It's better than modeling.

495
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,575
You didn't tell me I had to sing too.
You could've warned me.

496
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,580
You don't have to sing.

497
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:42,618
You have to dance so great that Jerome
Robbins won't care if you can sing.

498
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,214
- I don't know that kind of dancing.
- If you don't need the job, go home.

499
00:43:47,324 --> 00:43:49,224
Maybe Prince Charming
will drop by.

500
00:43:49,326 --> 00:43:54,093
All right. I'm sorry
for sounding so ungrateful, really.

501
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:56,758
I'm just scared I won't get it.

502
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:00,234
You're not the only one
Madame Rambert let go, you know...

503
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,805
but I think we have a chance
of getting this...

504
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,602
if we keep a smile on our face.

505
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:07,540
Oh, good, here's Nicky.

506
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:09,272
He's the star.

507
00:44:09,380 --> 00:44:11,280
- Kay, darling.
- Hello, Nick.

508
00:44:11,382 --> 00:44:13,942
This is my friend Audrey.

509
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:19,615
She's light as a feather.
I like her.

510
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:21,884
Once again, please.

511
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:42,672
You can see the skinny one's eyes
all the way to the back row.

512
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:46,307
All you'll see when she's dancing
is my choreography.

513
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,649
All right. We'll take a break
for a minute and try it again.

514
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,930
May I have your attention, ladies.

515
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:07,163
Mr. Robbins and the producers
of High Button Shoes...

516
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,899
would like to thank you all
for your hard work today.

517
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,067
If I don't read your name,
you may leave.

518
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:16,977
If I do read your name, you may get
lunch and be back in 20 minutes...

519
00:45:17,081 --> 00:45:18,639
ready to start rehearsal.

520
00:45:18,749 --> 00:45:20,683
"Collins.

521
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,017
Griffin.

522
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:25,349
Miller.

523
00:45:25,456 --> 00:45:28,152
Parks. Allen.

524
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,456
Cunningham. Kendall.

525
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,029
Hepburn."

526
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:34,620
Thank you.

527
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:40,129
I got it.

528
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,137
What did I tell you?

529
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:45,140
A million girls tried out for this,
and who got it? You.

530
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,210
And you. I thank you so much.

531
00:45:47,311 --> 00:45:50,109
- Congratulations!
- Thanks.

532
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:51,875
I'll see you at rehearsal.

533
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:59,211
Audrey, this is Marcel.
He's playing the piano for the show...

534
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,883
and he's going to be
a famous composer someday.

535
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,153
I'm very pleased to meet you.

536
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,458
I've noticed you dancing.
You have such lightness.

537
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:10,795
And I was wondering if you'd like
to join me for dinner.

538
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:12,801
She doesn't eat.

539
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,837
Well, then, do you drink?

540
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,499
Do you tell lies? There must be
something we could do together.

541
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:23,376
I would love to misbehave,
really I would, but I don't know how.

542
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:26,005
So what would you like to do?

543
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:38,520
Moonlight shadows

544
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:41,189
On a summer night

545
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:45,898
I kiss your lips

546
00:46:46,737 --> 00:46:50,537
You hold me tight

547
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:54,304
We dream of tomorrow

548
00:46:54,411 --> 00:46:58,370
Memories of yesterday

549
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:02,748
The wind in the willow tree

550
00:47:02,853 --> 00:47:06,482
Sweeps our love away

551
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,062
I was watching you last night.

552
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,900
Oh, I wish I were better.

553
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:26,305
Half the time I'm on stage,
I'm trying not to be seen.

554
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,139
Yes, I know.

555
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:33,440
But it is--

556
00:47:34,551 --> 00:47:36,712
How do you say? Useless.

557
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,654
Do you think they'll fire me?

558
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:43,214
No! It's useless for you
to try not to be seen.

559
00:47:43,327 --> 00:47:44,726
You are too beautiful.

560
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:46,523
Oh, please don't.

561
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,190
All over the world,
they will say this.

562
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:53,030
Even out of this world.
Even in space, they will say this.

563
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:55,036
The man on the moon will say...

564
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:58,869
" Look. See the one
with the long arms and the big eyes?

565
00:47:58,976 --> 00:48:00,534
Isn't she beautiful?"

566
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:04,576
- What will they say about you?
- Don't change the subject.

567
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:07,172
I'm telling you
something important.

568
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,685
All right.

569
00:48:09,786 --> 00:48:12,846
You have to let us look at you.

570
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:14,685
That's all we ask.

571
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,262
You have to let us look at you.

572
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:35,744
- Good show, ladies.
- Thank you, darling.

573
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,642
- They're from Cecil Landeau!
- Who's that?

574
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:44,585
The guy who produces
all those nightclub shows.

575
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:47,418
He wants you
for his new revue at Ciro's.

576
00:48:47,524 --> 00:48:50,823
- Would I have to give this up to do it?
- No. You could do both.

577
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,828
Revues start late.

578
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,516
Why should I give her a role
in a movie, Cecil?

579
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:17,610
She can't dance nor sing at all.

580
00:49:17,721 --> 00:49:21,282
I don't know what it is.
Audiences love her, and so do I.

581
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,112
Where are you from, Audrey?

582
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:53,553
I'm half Irish, half Dutch,
and I was born in Belgium.

583
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,387
If I were a dog,
I'd be a hell of a mess.

584
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:01,392
I hate to ask, but I wonder
if one of you gentlemen...

585
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,797
would give a girl a little spin
around the dance floor.

586
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:08,064
- Here you go, darling.
- So grateful, I'm sure.

587
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,899
And where's your family now?

588
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,978
Will I have the pleasure
of meeting them some evening?

589
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:18,639
My mother has a new job working
for a dressmaker here in London.

590
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:23,152
- And your father?
- I haven't seen my father in some time.

591
00:50:23,253 --> 00:50:25,813
Would you care to dance?

592
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:27,816
Delighted.

593
00:50:47,944 --> 00:50:50,469
I am sick of love with you.

594
00:50:50,580 --> 00:50:53,481
I was so jealous
watching you dance with him...

595
00:50:53,583 --> 00:50:58,111
I almost went to him and asked him for--
how do you say-- a duet.

596
00:50:59,289 --> 00:51:02,486
You are laughing at me.
You do not care that my heart is broken.

597
00:51:03,660 --> 00:51:06,322
You do not ask for a "duet."

598
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,796
You ask for a duel.

599
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:11,561
If i kill him,
will you marry me?

600
00:51:11,668 --> 00:51:13,329
You can't kill him.

601
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,463
His friend Mario just offered me
a part in a movie.

602
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:20,373
After you do the movie,
will you marry me?

603
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:24,311
Darling, if we got married,
you'd only grow very bored...

604
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:27,645
fall in love with another actress,
and I don't know if I could recover.

605
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,946
You are the one
who's going to leave me...

606
00:51:30,053 --> 00:51:32,214
but that's all right.

607
00:51:32,322 --> 00:51:35,951
It is my pleasure to be the first man
to have his heart broken by you.

608
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,786
Unless I'm not the first.

609
00:51:40,730 --> 00:51:42,527
Am I the first?

610
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:44,532
Do you swear I'm the first?

611
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,336
The first I've heard of.

612
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,853
Mother, wait till I tell you
what happened.

613
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,357
One of Cecil's friends offered me
a little part in a movie.

614
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,360
It's only one line,
but he says it's a good one.

615
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,123
What's wrong?

616
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,464
Is something the matter?

617
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:22,231
You have a letter
from the International Red Cross.

618
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:23,738
Did you write them?

619
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:26,399
I was looking for Father.

620
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,843
I thought they might have
some record on him.

621
00:52:31,548 --> 00:52:33,880
Is he dead?

622
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,542
What did the letter say?

623
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:39,213
I don't know what it's about.
I don't open your mail.

624
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:52,166
He isn't dead.

625
00:52:53,303 --> 00:52:55,897
Father isn't dead.

626
00:52:56,006 --> 00:52:58,566
He was in an internment camp
during the war.

627
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,478
What does that mean?

628
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:05,776
It's where they put Nazi sympathizers
to keep an eye on them.

629
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:08,680
Don't they let them
contact their families?

630
00:53:09,886 --> 00:53:12,411
If he had wanted to find us,
he could have.

631
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:15,013
- Then why didn't he?
- Perhaps he's ashamed of what he did.

632
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:17,025
Perhaps he feels like a traitor.

633
00:53:17,127 --> 00:53:20,494
Father is not a traitor.
Don't say that.

634
00:53:20,597 --> 00:53:23,760
Your father doesn't want us
to find him.

635
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,427
The sooner you accept that,
the better off you'll be.

636
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,527
How do you know what he feels?

637
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:32,373
You're right.
I never did.

638
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:37,276
I am going to find my father
if it takes me the rest of my life.

639
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:41,612
- You'll be sorry.
- I don't care if I'm sorry or not.

640
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,709
I'm going to find him.

641
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,458
Here it comes.

642
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,360
This is a good line?

643
00:53:59,469 --> 00:54:02,267
" Hello. Who wants a ciggie?"

644
00:54:03,473 --> 00:54:05,100
Flirtier, cuter.

645
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,610
You're not selling flowerpots.
You're selling ciggies.

646
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:16,146
Sexy, sweet-smelling ciggies.

647
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:19,848
Laughter In Paradise.
Scene 56, take 2. Clappers.

648
00:54:19,956 --> 00:54:21,583
Action.

649
00:54:21,691 --> 00:54:23,886
Hello. Who wants a ciggie?

650
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:26,519
Young Wives Tale.
Scene 32, take 4.

651
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,097
And action!

652
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:30,496
Good evening.
What would you like tonight?

653
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,933
Lavender Hill Mob.
Scene 1 5, take 1. Marker.

654
00:54:34,037 --> 00:54:36,096
Action.

655
00:54:36,206 --> 00:54:38,174
Oh, how sweet of you.

656
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:42,141
And cut.
That's a print.

657
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:44,577
All right, everyone.
That's lunch. One hour.

658
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:46,080
Kill the lights.

659
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,126
That was wonderful.

660
00:55:01,798 --> 00:55:06,360
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine, thank you.

661
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,469
Do you want me to be
in your movie?

662
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:15,101
Lunch is more what I had in mind,
but if it has to be a movie...

663
00:55:15,211 --> 00:55:17,042
I'll see about arranging one.

664
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:19,513
Forgive me.
I'm James Hanson.

665
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:22,483
How do you do?
I'm Audrey Hepburn.

666
00:55:23,553 --> 00:55:26,716
Who is that man talking to Audrey?

667
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,690
You know the handsome prince
in the fairy tales?

668
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:31,226
Yes.

669
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:32,727
That's him.

670
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:37,892
- Did you always want to be an actress?
- I'm not an actress.

671
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,960
Maybe someday I will be,
if I work very hard.

672
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,973
I am having
a wonderful time, though.

673
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,566
People keep asking me to do things,
and I just pray...

674
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:50,168
that I get through it
without embarrassing them too much.

675
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:53,181
I think you're
better than you know.

676
00:55:53,283 --> 00:55:55,410
And you,James...

677
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,180
have you always wanted
to be a wealthy aristocrat?

678
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:03,690
When I was a boy,
I wanted to be an Egyptian.

679
00:56:03,793 --> 00:56:05,192
Actually, a pharaoh.

680
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,853
Oh, of course.

681
00:56:06,963 --> 00:56:09,761
Racing chariots,
building pyramids.

682
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,935
- Do you build now in your--
- Pardon me, madame.

683
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,530
I'm sorry, do you work at all?

684
00:56:18,641 --> 00:56:21,439
My family's in transportation.

685
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,876
Are you saying you own a railroad?

686
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:26,574
Railroads and trucking lines and--

687
00:56:26,683 --> 00:56:30,414
Well, if you wanted to move,
say, the province of Ontario...

688
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,045
to the other side of Canada,
you'd call us.

689
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,520
All right, let's have a look.

690
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:44,962
How about this one?

691
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:47,298
I borrowed that one
for the opera last week.

692
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:50,237
Where are you two off to tonight,
Buckingham Palace?

693
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:54,902
Just dinner and the theater.
Sabrina Fair. Do you know it?

694
00:56:55,011 --> 00:56:56,774
Voilà!

695
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,816
The actress who wore this dress
didn't have a clue what to do with it.

696
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:02,475
Slip it on, darling.

697
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,154
I'm eating oysters and caviar...

698
00:57:06,256 --> 00:57:08,816
and things
I never even knew existed.

699
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,417
Playing golfand croquet.
It's like I'm in a dream.

700
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,692
The only thing wrong with him
is he doesn't want anything.

701
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:18,427
Probably because he already has
everything, I guess.

702
00:57:18,535 --> 00:57:22,164
You never hear him say,
"I wish I had such and such"...

703
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,207
or "If I only had such and such."

704
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:27,572
And you think this is a problem?

705
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:30,407
- Are you in love with him?
- I don't know.

706
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:33,175
Don't take too long deciding.
You might lose him.

707
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,250
Well?

708
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,819
The man doesn't have a prayer.

709
00:58:52,595 --> 00:58:54,062
Excuse me.

710
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:57,689
It's only been a few months, but...

711
00:58:59,135 --> 00:59:02,400
I honestly don't know
how I can go on living without you.

712
00:59:02,505 --> 00:59:05,065
Please tell me I won't have to.

713
00:59:06,676 --> 00:59:10,203
I couldn't live here,James,
not now.

714
00:59:11,681 --> 00:59:14,582
Who lives here?
I don't live here.

715
00:59:15,685 --> 00:59:18,245
We could just come here
when you needed a rest.

716
00:59:18,354 --> 00:59:20,413
I'm not asking you to stop working.

717
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:24,516
Do a play a year, even a movie a year,
if you feel like it.

718
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,320
Just marry me.

719
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,375
Will you marry me, Audrey?

720
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,084
I will.

721
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,424
I will.

722
01:00:11,007 --> 01:00:13,999
How can you have a career
and live in Yorkshire?

723
01:00:14,110 --> 01:00:16,010
Surely he doesn't expect you to.

724
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,775
He says I can do whatever I like--
a play a year, a movie a year.

725
01:00:19,882 --> 01:00:23,079
They'll say whatever they want to
in the beginning.

726
01:00:23,186 --> 01:00:25,086
He likes that I'm an actress...

727
01:00:25,188 --> 01:00:27,486
but I know I won't work that much
after we're married.

728
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,582
I wouldn't want to marry him
and not live with him.

729
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:33,685
Just don't set a date. Please.

730
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,924
And stop fussing with that scarf.
You'll be late for your audition.

731
01:00:37,033 --> 01:00:39,763
The only reason I'm going
is because Kay likes the director.

732
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:41,769
I could never do the role.

733
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:44,601
You can do anything
you want to, Audrey.

734
01:00:44,707 --> 01:00:46,538
No, Mother, I can't.

735
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:51,137
It says in the stage direction that
my character is peeing from a port hole.

736
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:54,808
Peeing from a port hole?
What kind of movie is this?

737
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,817
When the director
finally stopped laughing...

738
01:00:56,919 --> 01:00:58,580
he says, "It's a typo.

739
01:00:58,688 --> 01:01:02,146
You're not peeing from a por thole.
You're peering from a port hole."

740
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:05,625
So you're peering.
Did you get the job?

741
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:07,593
- I got the job.
- What?

742
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,723
They only took me because I could do
the French and the English...

743
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:12,994
but I'm going to Monte Carlo.

744
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,332
Congratulations!

745
01:01:17,306 --> 01:01:19,467
No, you can't go to Monte Carlo.

746
01:01:19,575 --> 01:01:22,043
With that schoolgirl hair,
oh, my, no.

747
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:25,046
- It's time for something new, my dear.
- Uh-huh.

748
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,223
All right, bring it forward.

749
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:42,225
Why don't you tell your millionaire
boyfriend to bring his boat here...

750
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,231
and take us for a sail?

751
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,733
- I don't tell James what to do.
- Too bad.

752
01:01:47,670 --> 01:01:49,570
But I can ask him.

753
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:52,606
All right. Again.

754
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,267
- Again?
- Yes.

755
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:02,950
Very good. Now spin.

756
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,755
This is my favorite part.

757
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:10,818
- How was that?
- Great.

758
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:13,589
But what-- what is this?

759
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:16,995
- What are you up to now?
- Nothing.

760
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:20,433
Where did it go?
Are you hiding it in there?

761
01:02:24,974 --> 01:02:27,807
Where did you learn that?
You in love with a clown?

762
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:32,108
No, but that's what I'm going to say
the next time somebody asks me. Again.

763
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:35,207
Look at her.
She's charming.

764
01:02:35,318 --> 01:02:39,015
You'd give this all up
for a handsome millionaire?

765
01:02:39,122 --> 01:02:40,350
Yes.

766
01:02:40,456 --> 01:02:43,084
I need to make a phone call.

767
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,895
Well, Miss Hepburn,
I will be brief.

768
01:02:49,999 --> 01:02:54,095
I want you to come to New York
and play the part of Gigi on Broadway.

769
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:58,969
You can read for our producers
next week in London.

770
01:02:59,075 --> 01:03:02,101
- You mean a play, Madame Colette?
- Mm-hmm.

771
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:05,374
- You want me to act in a play?
- Yes.

772
01:03:05,481 --> 01:03:09,281
Anita Loos, a difficult woman
but an excellent dramatist...

773
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:12,149
has adapted my novel for the stage.

774
01:03:12,255 --> 01:03:14,086
On Broadway! Oh, Audrey.

775
01:03:15,691 --> 01:03:19,218
Oh, I'm sorry, Madame.
There is a mistake.

776
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,559
It is an honor
that you have asked me...

777
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:24,690
but it is impossible.

778
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:27,736
I wouldn't be able to do it,
because I can't act.

779
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,964
You won't have to act
anything, darling.

780
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,633
You are Gigi.

781
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:40,677
- You auditioned for two hours?
- Who cares how long they kept her?

782
01:03:40,783 --> 01:03:43,081
- Do you think you got it?
- I don't know.

783
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:46,212
I don't think the producer
liked me at all, but Colette does.

784
01:03:46,322 --> 01:03:49,223
If she makes the decision,
I'll definitely get it.

785
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,316
If he does,
I don't have a prayer.

786
01:03:51,427 --> 01:03:55,295
If you don't get it, I wouldn't worry.
Something else will come up.

787
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,458
It already has.
Who's William Wyler?

788
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:03,800
- Are you serious?
- William Wyler is Hollywood, darling.

789
01:04:03,906 --> 01:04:06,932
-Hollywood?
-That's right. He's a big film director.

790
01:04:07,043 --> 01:04:11,207
Colette may get you on Broadway,
but William Wyler can make you a star.

791
