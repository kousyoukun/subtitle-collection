1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,354
Speaking of which, where
is the divine Lord James?

2
00:00:04,194 --> 00:00:07,493
All-England Polo Banquet.
Does that sound right?

3
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:10,692
Ah, there's the life.

4
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:16,834
Audrey Hepburn,
screen test, take one.

5
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:22,769
Could you tell us a little bit
about what it was like after the war?

6
00:00:23,847 --> 00:00:26,907
Well, my mother and I moved
to Amsterdam...

7
00:00:27,017 --> 00:00:29,485
so I could study dance again.

8
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:31,781
We tried to get
back our lives.

9
00:00:31,889 --> 00:00:35,290
Everybody was so grateful to
the United Nations after the war...

10
00:00:35,392 --> 00:00:37,553
for giving us
food, medicine...

11
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:40,528
and other things
we hadn't seen for years.

12
00:00:40,631 --> 00:00:44,863
Thank you, Audrey. Now, let's
try a little bit of the scene.

13
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,369
It's most unusual.

14
00:00:53,477 --> 00:00:56,878
I've never been alone with a man
with all my clothes on.

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,778
With my clothes off,
it's even more unusual.

16
00:01:01,652 --> 00:01:04,553
I don't seem to mind..

17
00:01:04,655 --> 00:01:06,423
Do you?

18
00:01:06,523 --> 00:01:09,583
An Azusa rose
from a couch of snows...

19
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:12,321
in the Aquisaronian Mountains.

20
00:01:12,429 --> 00:01:14,659
She's certainly
beautiful, Willie, but--

21
00:01:14,765 --> 00:01:16,667
Wait. The good
part's coming up.

22
00:01:16,767 --> 00:01:19,065
My instructions were
to keep the cameras rolling.

23
00:01:19,169 --> 00:01:22,536
All right. That's it. Cut.

24
00:01:22,639 --> 00:01:26,200
Only the director has the right
to say "cut" and he hasn't.

25
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,471
That was fun.

26
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:30,147
It's such a wonderful story...

27
00:01:30,247 --> 00:01:32,977
particularly the tantrums
the princess gets to throw.

28
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:36,314
Riding on a motor scooter, bashing
the man over the head with a guitar...

29
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,821
and feeling so sleepy, you
could just fall on the park bench.

30
00:01:39,923 --> 00:01:41,923
Cut.

31
00:01:43,994 --> 00:01:45,629
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,664
How did I do?
Was that all right?

33
00:01:48,765 --> 00:01:50,995
Does Greg Peck know she's going
to steal the picture from him?

34
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:53,228
Not yet.

35
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:55,567
That is such wonderful news.

36
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:57,672
Yes.

37
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:00,410
Thank you so much.

38
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:03,946
You've got them both--
the play and the movie.

39
00:02:09,353 --> 00:02:12,322
James, what are these
people thinking about?

40
00:02:12,422 --> 00:02:14,652
I haven't done either
of those things.

41
00:02:14,758 --> 00:02:16,126
They're not thinking.

42
00:02:16,226 --> 00:02:19,024
They've fallen for you,
just as I have. We love you.

43
00:02:19,129 --> 00:02:20,797
But why?

44
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:24,264
It's not something you're doing.
It's something you are.

45
00:02:24,368 --> 00:02:27,496
Tall and skinny, with
a long neck and big feet.

46
00:02:28,772 --> 00:02:30,797
Precisely.

47
00:02:30,907 --> 00:02:33,637
My first trip
to America...

48
00:02:33,744 --> 00:02:36,736
and I'm going to
Hollywood and Broadway.

49
00:02:55,298 --> 00:02:57,067
May I help you?

50
00:02:57,167 --> 00:02:59,294
I hope that I'm in the
right place. I'm supposed--

51
00:02:59,403 --> 00:03:01,928
What's your name, dear?
- Audrey Hepburn.

52
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:05,372
Oh, good morning, Miss Hepburn,
and welcome to New York.

53
00:03:05,475 --> 00:03:06,743
I'm Joe.

54
00:03:06,843 --> 00:03:11,143
If any of those bums inside give you
a rough time, you just come see me.

55
00:03:11,248 --> 00:03:13,248
Thank you,Joe.

56
00:03:15,452 --> 00:03:18,114
" But, Grandma,
I'm wearing my drawers."

57
00:03:23,727 --> 00:03:25,128
It's not that funny.

58
00:03:25,228 --> 00:03:29,665
No, we're laughing at your
enthusiasm, my dear, I'm afraid.

59
00:03:29,766 --> 00:03:33,497
It's bad form to
start acting on day one.

60
00:03:33,603 --> 00:03:35,539
We're just reading today.

61
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,437
As if we can't imagine
what we're all doing here.

62
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:46,481
Okay, everybody, break's over.
We'll continue where we left off.

63
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,520
Audrey, you cross up
to your aunt...

64
00:03:51,621 --> 00:03:54,112
and throw yourself
into the chair in despair.

65
00:03:55,392 --> 00:03:58,623
Mr. Rouleau, I keep
forgetting. Which way is up?

66
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,728
Up is up. Upstage.

67
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,468
Where I am, dear.

68
00:04:04,568 --> 00:04:07,799
Up is behind you.
Down is in front.

69
00:04:08,905 --> 00:04:10,307
Left is stage left...

70
00:04:10,407 --> 00:04:12,739
your right
if you are facing up.

71
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:16,311
To your aunt.

72
00:04:23,854 --> 00:04:25,822
Did I say leap
like a gazelle?

73
00:04:25,922 --> 00:04:27,981
Did I say run?
What did I say?

74
00:04:28,091 --> 00:04:29,159
Cross.

75
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,921
Cross. Like a
despondent schoolgirl.

76
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:36,556
No. She's not despondent. She's angry.
She doesn't want to be a courtesan.

77
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:39,931
When you can act,
you can give me direction.

78
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:41,304
Until that time...

79
00:04:41,404 --> 00:04:43,404
you will do as I say.

80
00:04:48,245 --> 00:04:49,613
I want to go dancing.

81
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:52,147
Somewhere very glamorous
where we get in for free...

82
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:54,410
because rich old men
want to dance with us.

83
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:58,352
Oh, and I want to smoke a cigar.
I've never smoked a cigar.

84
00:04:58,455 --> 00:05:01,185
How can you stay out like this
and have anything left for tomorrow?

85
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:03,725
I can't bear for there to be
a Fifth Avenue...

86
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:05,954
that I haven't walked on
every night.

87
00:05:06,062 --> 00:05:08,031
Then, too, if they
end up firing me...

88
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:10,827
at least I have this
beautiful city to remember.

89
00:05:10,934 --> 00:05:13,266
Good night, Audrey.
- Good night.

90
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,370
Good night.

91
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:23,571
Look at her. He's
working her too hard.

92
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,047
Anita, it isn't what she does
in the daytime that's the problem.

93
00:05:28,218 --> 00:05:30,187
Okay, everyone. Break's over.

94
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:33,814
We'll continue where we
left off. Act 2, scene 2.

95
00:05:33,924 --> 00:05:35,924
Places, please.

96
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,152
I'm trying to do what he wants,
but he gets so angry with me.

97
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:43,096
He says you're
perfectly confident in French.

98
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,294
Yes. If only we could do
the entire play in French...

99
00:05:46,403 --> 00:05:48,371
I'm sure I wouldn't have
any trouble at all.

100
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:51,099
Miss Hepburn, if you can't do
the role in English...

101
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,176
we'll have to find
someone who can.

102
00:05:53,276 --> 00:05:55,369
It would be better if we work
on voice and diction...

103
00:05:55,478 --> 00:05:57,380
every day after rehearsal.

104
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,505
You look like you're about
to faint all the time.

105
00:05:59,616 --> 00:06:02,642
When was the last time you ate?
- Are you getting enough sleep?

106
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,982
Her picture is in
the papers every day.

107
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:08,819
Every night a new club.
How can she be sleeping?

108
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:12,827
The publicity is good for the show.
That much I'll give her.

109
00:06:14,397 --> 00:06:16,397
Can you give her
another week, Raymond?

110
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:19,636
On two conditions.

111
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:22,569
One: That she gives up
all her amusements...

112
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:25,004
except this show,
until we open.

113
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:27,010
And two:

114
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:30,307
That you continue looking
for someone to replace her...

115
00:06:30,413 --> 00:06:32,413
in case she doesn't.

116
00:06:36,253 --> 00:06:40,883
I'm terribly sorry to
have caused so much trouble...

117
00:06:40,991 --> 00:06:44,552
and I promise that you will not
have to speak to me in this way again.

118
00:06:56,139 --> 00:06:58,471
Hello, darling.

119
00:06:58,575 --> 00:07:01,908
Hello, sweetheart.
- Are they treating you any better?

120
00:07:02,012 --> 00:07:05,004
They're not the
problem,James. It's me.

121
00:07:05,115 --> 00:07:08,642
It can't be you.
You're perfect.

122
00:07:08,752 --> 00:07:11,687
I know it doesn't make
any sense...

123
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,256
but I wish my father
could be here with me.

124
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:19,123
When you have a show
opening on Broadway...

125
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:21,891
a father's supposed to be there
to share it with you.

126
00:07:22,999 --> 00:07:25,524
I'm sorry, darling.
I know it hurts you that--

127
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:30,538
The last time I saw my father was when
he put me on a plane before the war.

128
00:07:32,609 --> 00:07:35,772
Maybe he doesn't think
he should be there.

129
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,040
When I have a child, I'm going
to be there for everything.

130
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,518
Everything.

131
00:07:41,618 --> 00:07:44,917
He probably understands how
much trouble he could cause you.

132
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,690
I'd better get to sleep.

133
00:07:49,926 --> 00:07:52,156
Good night.
- Goodnight, darling.

134
00:08:46,216 --> 00:08:47,851
Whenever you're ready.

135
00:08:47,951 --> 00:08:52,581
I have two new hats and
another pair of high-heeled shoes.

136
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,987
What do you think of me?

137
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,593
Louder.

138
00:08:56,693 --> 00:09:00,925
I have two new hats and
another pair of high-heeled shoes!

139
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:05,433
No, no. Not every word louder,
as if you're in a playground.

140
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:08,463
The important
words louder.

141
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:13,436
The audience doesn't
just listen. They watch you.

142
00:09:16,112 --> 00:09:20,913
It is your face that tells them
which words are important.

143
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:24,118
Like this.

144
00:09:25,722 --> 00:09:29,158
I have two new hats.

145
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,318
Let your eyes sparkle
on the word "two."

146
00:09:31,428 --> 00:09:36,229
Two hats make
this girl a queen.

147
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:41,065
And when the audience knows
what "two" mean to Gigi...

148
00:09:41,171 --> 00:09:43,230
they understand who she is.

149
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:46,908
With two hats...

150
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,740
Gigi can conquer the world.

151
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,647
Oh, and she does.

152
00:09:53,783 --> 00:09:58,311
That's it! That is
exactly the Gigi look!

153
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:01,515
With that look, you
don't even need two hats.

154
00:10:01,624 --> 00:10:03,624
Now, say the line again.

155
00:10:06,196 --> 00:10:08,892
I have two new hats...

156
00:10:08,998 --> 00:10:11,728
and another pair
of high-heeled shoes.

157
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:14,861
That's right. Now
the hats are beautiful.

158
00:10:14,971 --> 00:10:18,737
But the shoes
are pure sex.

159
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,038
Well, I'm afraid I don't know
anything about pure sex.

160
00:10:23,146 --> 00:10:24,714
Gigi doesn't either.

161
00:10:24,814 --> 00:10:26,941
But when you...

162
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:29,917
tell him about the shoes...

163
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:33,113
you let him know that you're
willing to learn about sex...

164
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:36,124
if he's interested in teaching.

165
00:10:36,226 --> 00:10:38,226
Which, of course, he is.

166
00:10:40,063 --> 00:10:43,362
But does every line have
a secret meaning like this?

167
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:45,435
How will I ever get it?

168
00:10:45,535 --> 00:10:47,730
You have good instincts.

169
00:10:47,837 --> 00:10:49,896
You have a real desire
to please the audience...

170
00:10:50,006 --> 00:10:53,533
and just the right degree
of unpredictable.

171
00:10:53,643 --> 00:10:56,578
The audience likes
a dangerous performer...

172
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:59,978
and your particular kind of danger
is that it seems like...

173
00:11:02,018 --> 00:11:04,543
you might be able to fly.

174
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:20,594
Maman, I have wonderful news.
Tonton and I are going to be married.

175
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:25,805
Oh, Maman, please don't cry.
Tonton, can't you do something?

176
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:28,070
Perhaps she could use a drink.

177
00:11:28,177 --> 00:11:29,946
Andree,
pull yourself together!

178
00:11:30,046 --> 00:11:32,571
Yes, Maman. Would you
like to sing something?

179
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:36,174
Andree, we're going to be
happy together. Help us celebrate.

180
00:11:36,286 --> 00:11:38,286
Yes. Would you please sing?

181
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:43,224
Thank you.

182
00:11:43,993 --> 00:11:46,359
Well, see you
at the party.

183
00:12:02,278 --> 00:12:04,371
Raymond would fire her
right away if he could.

184
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,472
Of course, if the reviews
are bad for her, he just might.

185
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:12,350
Everything will be fine.
- I hope so.

186
00:12:12,455 --> 00:12:14,455
Anita, the verdict's in.

187
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:17,959
Can I have your
attention, please?

188
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:26,262
"The delightful
Miss Hepburn...

189
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:29,463
obviously is not
an experienced actress...

190
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:33,736
but her quality
is so winning, so true...

191
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,843
that she is the success
of the evening."

192
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:43,484
"A young actress
of great charm...

193
00:12:43,586 --> 00:12:45,747
who pulls the
whole thing into focus."

194
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:48,085
"The acting find of the year!"

195
00:12:48,191 --> 00:12:52,127
"Audrey Hepburn
is nearly perfect as Gigi."

196
00:13:00,370 --> 00:13:03,931
They hate the play, and they
love her. Can you believe it?

197
00:13:06,209 --> 00:13:08,575
Smile. That's it.
Big smile now.

198
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:26,394
Just look at them, darling.

199
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,567
Do you know
what a gift that is...

200
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:34,831
just to make people
smile like that?

201
00:14:08,304 --> 00:14:11,137
I'm trying to arrange it so I
can be in Rome the whole time...

202
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,142
while you're shooting
Roman Holiday.

203
00:14:13,242 --> 00:14:16,006
Then we can be married
before you start the Gigi tour...

204
00:14:16,112 --> 00:14:18,081
if you do a Gigi tour.

205
00:14:18,181 --> 00:14:20,181
Maybe you'll just want to rest.

206
00:14:25,955 --> 00:14:28,389
I can't marry you,James.

207
00:14:31,227 --> 00:14:34,993
Why don't you just enjoy your opening,
and once everything calms down--

208
00:14:35,098 --> 00:14:37,362
No, I don't want things
to calm down.

209
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:40,901
I love what's
happened to me...

210
00:14:41,971 --> 00:14:43,971
but I can't have everything.

211
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:48,035
I was nearly fired from Gigi
for spending too many nights out.

212
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:50,144
I have to be serious about this.

213
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,284
All I want to do is help.

214
00:14:56,385 --> 00:14:59,013
Wouldn't it help
if I was there all the time?

215
00:15:00,757 --> 00:15:02,757
No.

216
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:06,792
If you were there,
I'd want to be with you...

217
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:11,697
to make sure you were
having a good time.

218
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:14,895
Pretty soon, I wouldn't be
thinking about acting at all.

219
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:20,937
Then I'd be fired or not
hired again, and I don't want that.

220
00:15:22,311 --> 00:15:26,111
I want to see
how good I can be.

221
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:31,412
I don't want to be
the cute young girl forever.

222
00:15:33,189 --> 00:15:35,487
I want my life
to mean something...

223
00:15:35,591 --> 00:15:39,288
and I can't do that
and be married too.

224
00:15:40,797 --> 00:15:42,797
I just know I can't.

225
00:15:43,533 --> 00:15:45,763
Please forgive me.

226
00:15:53,776 --> 00:15:58,338
If that's what you decide,
I'll understand, of course.

227
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,750
I didn't know what I
wanted, and now I do.

228
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:13,152
I have loved you
as much as I can.

229
00:16:14,997 --> 00:16:19,593
But I love this work so much,
and that isn't fair.

230
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,433
Can't you just let me go?

231
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:33,681
If I have to.

232
00:16:35,985 --> 00:16:37,985
Thank you, darling.

233
00:17:31,474 --> 00:17:35,342
Audrey. Have you ever seen
Capote talk to anyone?

234
00:17:35,444 --> 00:17:38,902
He's always just sitting around
rubbing his face, looking all depressed.

235
00:17:39,015 --> 00:17:41,483
I don't think he
approves of us, George...

236
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:43,584
but I'm working on it.

237
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:51,087
Can I ask you a question?
- About what?

238
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:54,287
About the character
you've written, of course.

239
00:17:54,397 --> 00:17:56,490
She's a call girl.
- I know that.

240
00:17:56,599 --> 00:18:00,797
But she doesn't actually seem
to have sex with all of these men.

241
00:18:00,903 --> 00:18:03,736
So is it only some of them,
or only the ones she wants to marry?

242
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:05,675
What do you think?

243
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:09,973
Well, I think she's a lot
like I was in the beginning.

244
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:12,079
Which was?

245
00:18:12,548 --> 00:18:15,415
Afraid to let somebody know
how little I knew.

246
00:18:17,653 --> 00:18:20,144
Roman Holiday,
scene 52, take 3. Marker.

247
00:18:35,771 --> 00:18:37,771
Cut!

248
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:45,037
That wasn't so bad, was it?
- Oh, I'm having such a good time.

249
00:18:45,147 --> 00:18:46,449
Really I am.

250
00:18:46,549 --> 00:18:49,074
See, it's easy to look like
you're having fun in the movies.

251
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:51,153
Just open your eyes
as wide as you can...

252
00:18:51,253 --> 00:18:53,949
stare straight ahead
and hang on for dear life.

253
00:18:54,056 --> 00:18:57,355
I love making movies even more
than I love watching them...

254
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,028
and I love watching them.

255
00:18:59,128 --> 00:19:02,120
And I love seeing it all
through your eyes.

256
00:19:02,231 --> 00:19:04,961
I haven't had so much fun
on a movie in years.

257
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:07,627
The first night our town
in Holland was liberated...

258
00:19:07,737 --> 00:19:11,730
they set up a big screen in the middle
of the street and showed us a movie.

259
00:19:11,841 --> 00:19:14,241
And do you know
what it was about?

260
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:17,312
War. And you know what?

261
00:19:17,413 --> 00:19:20,143
We liked it.
We loved it.

262
00:19:22,651 --> 00:19:24,253
The papers said what?

263
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:26,255
They said you
and Gregory Peck...

264
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:28,721
were having an affair
during the filming.

265
00:19:28,824 --> 00:19:30,326
But it isn't true.

266
00:19:30,426 --> 00:19:32,792
Can't someone tell them
that it isn't true?

267
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:35,363
You're going to have to be
very careful now, Audrey.

268
00:19:35,464 --> 00:19:38,831
Don't tell anyone anything you don't
want to read on the front page.

269
00:19:41,871 --> 00:19:44,203
Just keep smiling
until we get to the front.

270
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:47,867
Miss Hepburn, how does it feel to be
playing the lead in your first movie?

271
00:19:50,946 --> 00:19:54,006
Before I introduce Audrey to you...

272
00:19:54,116 --> 00:19:56,641
I want to introduce
all of you to Audrey.

273
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,623
My dear, these people
standing up front are reporters.

274
00:20:03,759 --> 00:20:06,990
The ones standing at the back
are bankers and lawyers.

275
00:20:07,096 --> 00:20:10,361
And those people over in
the corner kicking themselves...

276
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:12,764
are the studio executives...

277
00:20:12,868 --> 00:20:15,769
who did not hire you
to a 100-year contract.

278
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:20,272
Ladies and gentlemen,
Miss Audrey Hepburn.

279
00:20:23,446 --> 00:20:24,780
How's it going, princess?

280
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,474
You have my permission
to withdraw.

281
00:20:29,051 --> 00:20:31,383
Is it true your
next picture is Sabrina?

282
00:20:31,487 --> 00:20:34,285
Yes, it is.

283
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:37,382
I asked the studio to
buy it for me, and they did.

284
00:20:37,493 --> 00:20:39,028
Isn't that amazing?

285
00:20:39,128 --> 00:20:42,655
But the best part is that I get to fly
to Paris to pick out the clothes.

286
00:20:42,765 --> 00:20:46,326
What do you think of all these girls
cutting their hair to look like you?

287
00:20:47,269 --> 00:20:49,829
Well, I can only hope
that the haircut...

288
00:20:49,939 --> 00:20:52,373
works as well for them
as it has for me.

289
00:20:52,475 --> 00:20:55,706
Miss Hepburn, your parents must be
very proud. Are they here?

290
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:57,680
My mother is right over there.

291
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,981
Where? Where?

292
00:20:59,081 --> 00:21:00,683
And your father?

293
00:21:00,783 --> 00:21:02,783
Is he proud?

294
00:21:03,686 --> 00:21:07,349
My father is a man that likes
to keep his feelings to himself.

295
00:21:07,456 --> 00:21:09,456
Next question.

296
00:21:12,061 --> 00:21:14,030
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

297
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,724
Audrey, I'd like you to meet
a great friend of mine.

298
00:21:16,832 --> 00:21:19,528
This is Mel Ferrer,
a wonderful actor and director.

299
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:22,832
Oh, what a pleasure.
- The pleasure is all mine.

300
00:21:22,938 --> 00:21:26,169
You were wonderful in Lili.
I haven't seen the new movies.

301
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:28,110
Well, you'd better
start watching.

302
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,046
You're going to be
very big in pictures.

303
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,514
That's what I
keep telling her.

304
00:21:31,614 --> 00:21:35,243
Sabrina is perfect for you.
Who's playing the smart brother?

305
00:21:35,351 --> 00:21:37,253
Bogie.

306
00:21:37,353 --> 00:21:39,353
He doesn't really like
beautiful women.

307
00:21:39,455 --> 00:21:41,855
Maybe next time I'll get the chance
to be the lucky leading man.

308
00:21:41,957 --> 00:21:44,619
Well, now I'm
the one dreaming.

309
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:47,396
Ready, darling?
- Yes.

310
00:21:47,496 --> 00:21:49,496
Good night, gentlemen.

311
00:21:49,598 --> 00:21:53,193
Talk to you soon, Greg?
It really was a pleasure.

312
00:22:09,385 --> 00:22:11,444
Katharine, darling.

313
00:22:13,088 --> 00:22:16,546
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Monsieur Givenchy.

314
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,659
I'm Audrey Hepburn.

315
00:22:21,797 --> 00:22:23,099
Please forgive me.

316
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:26,532
They told me Miss Hepburn
the film star was coming to see me.

317
00:22:26,635 --> 00:22:30,002
Whowould have known there were
two such lovely women?

318
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:32,105
Let's get to work, shall we?

319
00:22:41,183 --> 00:22:44,243
I like the pink.
- It's my favorite as well.

320
00:22:44,353 --> 00:22:47,516
The rest of them don't understand
the pink, but we are right.

321
00:22:47,623 --> 00:22:49,623
It is sublime.

322
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:52,353
You don't think it will make
my neck look too long?

323
00:22:52,461 --> 00:22:54,986
There is no such thing
as "too long."

324
00:22:55,097 --> 00:22:57,827
Not in legs, not in necks--
- Not in life?

325
00:23:00,803 --> 00:23:04,330
My dear Audrey, I think you are
more beautiful inside than out.

326
00:23:09,645 --> 00:23:12,443
Maybe a very small hat.

327
00:23:12,548 --> 00:23:14,483
Maybe a large hat...

328
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,642
and large sunglasses.

329
00:23:29,398 --> 00:23:30,900
I love it.

330
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,833
But I'll be riding in a convertible.
I can't be holding onto my hat.

331
00:23:33,936 --> 00:23:37,235
Then we will save it
for another film.

332
00:23:37,339 --> 00:23:41,002
Here is your small American
convertible hat.

333
00:23:46,382 --> 00:23:49,510
I think I have to have
a small dog to go with this hat.

334
00:23:59,962 --> 00:24:01,962
We shall make you
the princess of the ball.

335
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,041
It's magnificent.

336
00:25:10,699 --> 00:25:13,998
Oh, dear, look at him.

337
00:25:14,103 --> 00:25:17,800
Don't be afraid of Bogart.
- Not him. The other one.

338
00:25:17,906 --> 00:25:21,000
Holden, yeah. He's the one
to be afraid of, all right.

339
00:25:22,044 --> 00:25:24,103
What's he doing?
- He's coming to open your door.

340
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:28,309
-I can beat him to it if you want me to.
-No, you stay right where you are.

341
00:25:32,821 --> 00:25:34,821
Good afternoon.

342
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:41,187
My God, look at you.

343
00:25:42,064 --> 00:25:44,064
Hello there.

344
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:47,601
Come on. I'll introduce you to the gang.
We're having a little party.

345
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:09,758
Let's get a drink.
What will it be?

346
00:26:09,858 --> 00:26:11,985
Whiskey.
- Two whiskeys.

347
00:26:30,612 --> 00:26:32,612
They're watching us.

348
00:26:33,649 --> 00:26:35,649
Let them watch.

349
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,325
You've never been kissed?

350
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:46,121
Not by a married man
in the middle of a party.

351
00:26:46,228 --> 00:26:47,930
Well, then,
let's get out of here.

352
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:52,626
No. You stay, and I'll leave
while I still can.

353
00:27:19,695 --> 00:27:21,925
So, Audrey, did you make it
all right up the tree?

354
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:23,298
I did.

355
00:27:23,398 --> 00:27:26,367
When we make the shot tonight,
can you get up there faster?

356
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:28,468
I can.

357
00:27:28,937 --> 00:27:30,937
Gretchen,
I need to talk to you.

358
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:41,581
Tell me how the hell I can romance
that ridiculous girl...

359
00:27:41,683 --> 00:27:43,252
when you're watching
from a tree?

360
00:27:43,352 --> 00:27:45,411
I won't look
if you don't want me to.

361
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:48,718
Aw, stay there. I can't
get you out of my mind, anyway.

362
00:27:48,824 --> 00:27:51,452
Say, what are
you doing tonight?

363
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,495
I'll have to ask Mother.

364
00:27:53,595 --> 00:27:55,654
Ask her if you could
spend the night with me.

365
00:27:55,764 --> 00:27:59,427
Actually, I know the
answer to that, thank you.

366
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:01,170
How could you
say such a thing?

367
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:04,296
I'm crazy for you, baby. I'm not
giving up no matter what you say.

368
00:28:04,406 --> 00:28:06,406
Bill, I need you
over here, please.

369
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:41,374
He's quite handsome...

370
00:28:42,044 --> 00:28:44,512
in an American sort of way.

371
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:48,147
And I'm falling
in love with him.

372
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,250
I'm trying not to.

373
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,911
He's married.
- I know he's married.

374
00:28:54,022 --> 00:28:57,321
And I know what they say,
that he has a girl in every movie...

375
00:28:57,426 --> 00:28:59,426
but he's not that way with me.

376
00:28:59,528 --> 00:29:01,528
What about your career?

377
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:04,895
When I'm with him, I don't
even think about my career.

378
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:08,231
I just feel happy and light.

379
00:29:08,337 --> 00:29:10,337
I want to feel
like this forever.

380
00:29:15,577 --> 00:29:17,943
Isn't this the way
you felt about James?

381
00:29:18,046 --> 00:29:21,948
James was dear and
very good to me, but Bill...

382
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:25,552
he makes my heart stop.

383
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:46,474
Okay, five-minute warning,
everyone. Stand by.

384
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:48,907
Stand by.
Five-minute warning. Thank you.

385
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:54,947
Okay, everybody,
clear the frame, please.

386
00:30:17,139 --> 00:30:20,438
If I didn't have to finish this movie,
I would drop dead right now.

387
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:24,302
Well, that isn't necessary.

388
00:30:27,516 --> 00:30:30,781
For as long as I live, I will
never see anyone more beautiful...

389
00:30:30,886 --> 00:30:33,480
than you are at this moment.

390
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:36,421
I am hopelessly in love
with you, head over heels.

391
00:30:36,525 --> 00:30:38,460
Every cliché in the book.

392
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,825
What do I have to do
to have a chance with you?

393
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,455
Audrey, Bogie, stand by.

394
00:30:47,703 --> 00:30:50,467
How could I kiss Bogie now
after what you've just said?

395
00:30:51,573 --> 00:30:53,573
Bill, I need you out of there.

396
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:58,279
Ready to roll.
- Getting ready to shoot now.

397
00:31:02,317 --> 00:31:05,684
All right, people. Let's go.
- Everyone in place, please.

398
00:31:05,787 --> 00:31:07,689
All right, quiet down.

399
00:31:07,789 --> 00:31:09,814
Come on, now. Be ready.

400
00:31:09,925 --> 00:31:11,393
Okay, everybody.
Here we go.

401
00:31:11,493 --> 00:31:13,493
Sabrina, scene 44, take 3.

402
00:31:14,596 --> 00:31:16,596
Action.

403
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:25,032
If David were here,
he'd kiss you right now.

404
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:27,075
Yes, he would.

405
00:31:27,175 --> 00:31:29,175
It's all in the family.

406
00:31:37,619 --> 00:31:39,354
What's the matter with Bogie?

407
00:31:39,454 --> 00:31:41,479
The most beautiful girl
in the world...

408
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:44,787
and it looks like he has
to force himself to kiss her.

409
00:31:44,893 --> 00:31:46,893
Cut.

410
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:53,330
What?
- I love this movie.

411
00:31:53,435 --> 00:31:56,233
I catch myself pretending sometimes
that it's not a movie...

412
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:57,906
that it's real life.

413
00:31:58,006 --> 00:32:00,600
I've just returned from Paris
with my cute little dog...

414
00:32:00,709 --> 00:32:02,678
my father lives in
the garage over there...

415
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:06,339
and you, you're
in love with me.

416
00:32:06,448 --> 00:32:08,575
How would you like
the movie to end?

417
00:32:08,683 --> 00:32:12,949
I'd marry you. We'd have a house full
of children, live happily ever after.

418
00:32:13,054 --> 00:32:15,023
It's not that your
brother isn't nice.

419
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:17,819
I could never love him
the way I love you.

420
00:32:17,926 --> 00:32:20,121
You could marry me
if you wanted to.

421
00:32:23,131 --> 00:32:26,032
Do you think
they'd rewrite the movie?

422
00:32:26,134 --> 00:32:29,160
No. Not in the movie.
In Reno or Las Vegas.

423
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,271
Wherever I get my divorce.

424
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
A divorce?

425
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,245
You would get a divorce?

426
00:32:37,345 --> 00:32:39,472
I wasn't kidding, Audrey.

427
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,316
I want you.

428
00:32:41,416 --> 00:32:43,680
I want you to marry me.

429
00:32:43,785 --> 00:32:45,785
I love you, Audrey.

430
00:32:46,855 --> 00:32:48,855
Say that you'll marry me.

431
00:32:51,993 --> 00:32:55,451
Say that I'm not dreaming.
Are you playing with me?

432
00:32:55,564 --> 00:32:57,862
Is that a yes?
- It's a yes.

433
00:32:57,966 --> 00:32:59,966
And a yes and a yes.

434
00:33:03,972 --> 00:33:05,941
It will be so beautiful...

435
00:33:06,041 --> 00:33:08,271
our days and our nights.

436
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:11,004
Our work and our holidays.
Our friends and our children!

437
00:33:12,214 --> 00:33:15,411
Who needs friends or children?
I don't want to share you with anybody.

438
00:33:15,517 --> 00:33:17,152
You're right about the friends...

439
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:19,252
but a couple of children
wouldn't be too much.

440
00:33:20,355 --> 00:33:21,757
They're so noisy...

441
00:33:21,857 --> 00:33:24,257
and they're always around
when you don't want them to be.

442
00:33:24,359 --> 00:33:27,157
Think about what our
children would look like.

443
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:30,754
Me holding a little boy in my arms
that looks just like you.

444
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:36,371
I can't do it, Audrey.

445
00:33:36,471 --> 00:33:38,471
I can't have any more children.

446
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:43,209
What do you mean?

447
00:33:43,478 --> 00:33:45,605
I had a vasectomy
a couple of years ago.

448
00:33:47,549 --> 00:33:49,549
Can't you do something?

449
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:52,151
No, it's irreversible.

450
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:56,792
What?

451
00:33:56,892 --> 00:33:58,892
What?

452
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:02,061
Talk to me.
- I had better go home.

453
00:34:02,163 --> 00:34:04,032
You're not going anywhere.

454
00:34:04,132 --> 00:34:05,834
I need to.

455
00:34:05,934 --> 00:34:07,636
We can still have children...

456
00:34:07,736 --> 00:34:09,736
just not my children.

457
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:14,073
My children would probably
be drunks, anyway.

458
00:34:15,043 --> 00:34:19,070
I have to go before I say something
that I will probably be sorry for.

459
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,172
"Sorry for"? Say it.
Whatever it is, we'll work it out.

460
00:34:24,953 --> 00:34:28,855
It wouldn't be a real
marriage without children.

461
00:34:28,957 --> 00:34:30,957
I want to be a mother.

462
00:34:34,429 --> 00:34:36,829
You can't walk away from me
because of something like this.

463
00:34:36,932 --> 00:34:38,932
I'm in love with you.

464
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,261
I got you off that shelf
you've been sitting on.

465
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:43,860
Don't use this children thing
as an excuse to get back there!

466
00:34:46,474 --> 00:34:48,474
Look at me!

467
00:34:54,282 --> 00:34:56,409
I have to go.

468
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:00,119
Audrey, no.

469
00:35:04,759 --> 00:35:06,759
Audrey!

470
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:22,705
It's very hard,
telling someone good-bye...

471
00:35:23,979 --> 00:35:26,140
even when you know
you're doing the right thing.

472
00:35:27,082 --> 00:35:29,082
If I didn't have children...

473
00:35:30,785 --> 00:35:33,083
I wouldn't know I was alive.

474
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:40,321
I didn't particularly
want children till I had you.

475
00:35:41,796 --> 00:35:45,459
You've given me the
greatest joy I've ever known.

476
00:35:46,701 --> 00:35:50,831
You are the love of my life,
and I want that for you.

477
00:35:52,073 --> 00:35:54,837
I want you to
have a child.

478
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,781
I know.

479
00:35:59,881 --> 00:36:02,782
You have no idea
how you'll get through this.

480
00:36:04,185 --> 00:36:06,619
But in the morning, you'll see.

481
00:36:07,555 --> 00:36:09,555
You will.

482
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,818
Now, why don't you
go to bed. Try to rest.

483
00:36:17,766 --> 00:36:19,766
I'll bring you some tea.

484
00:36:20,769 --> 00:36:22,769
Thank you.

485
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:02,241
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

486
00:37:10,985 --> 00:37:13,453
I think just the
sight of you will do.

487
00:37:13,555 --> 00:37:16,217
As a matter of fact,
I'm feeling better already.

488
00:37:16,324 --> 00:37:19,225
Mel Ferrer.
- I know who you are.

489
00:37:19,327 --> 00:37:21,327
Please, come in.

490
00:37:24,799 --> 00:37:27,495
Your French is beautiful.
- Ah, yeah.

491
00:37:27,602 --> 00:37:29,571
My mother thought
it was important...

492
00:37:29,671 --> 00:37:32,139
and I'm beginning
to think she was right.

493
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,209
Forgive me just showing up
at your door like this.

494
00:37:34,309 --> 00:37:36,800
I tried to convince the studio
to throw another party...

495
00:37:36,911 --> 00:37:40,176
so I could meet you again,
but that seemed a little extreme...

496
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:43,182
so I brought you a play.

497
00:37:43,284 --> 00:37:44,519
A play.

498
00:37:44,619 --> 00:37:46,678
It's a wonderful play.
You should do another play.

499
00:37:46,788 --> 00:37:48,757
Keep the Hollywood girls
on their toes.

500
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:50,792
Congratulations on
Sabrina, by the way.

501
00:37:50,892 --> 00:37:53,122
Everyone who's seen it
says you're the best thing in it.

502
00:37:53,228 --> 00:37:55,228
Thank you.

503
00:37:55,797 --> 00:37:57,797
Well, I'll make us some tea...

504
00:37:57,899 --> 00:37:59,801
and then you must tell me
everything that you've done...

505
00:37:59,901 --> 00:38:01,901
since I saw you last.

506
00:38:03,304 --> 00:38:05,304
It's Cuban and Chinese.

507
00:38:07,509 --> 00:38:09,909
Growing up in New york,
I think I ate it every day.

508
00:38:10,011 --> 00:38:13,208
Of course, now that I'm
an adult, every other day.

509
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,916
The wine is wonderful.

510
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:23,182
I suppose I should get going.
- No.

511
00:38:25,226 --> 00:38:26,461
Do you have to?

512
00:38:26,561 --> 00:38:27,962
Yes, I do.

513
00:38:28,062 --> 00:38:30,062
I want to give you time
to read that play...

514
00:38:30,165 --> 00:38:32,793
so you can phone me in the morning
and tell me what you think.

515
00:38:32,901 --> 00:38:35,062
Is it a romantic play?

516
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:40,067
It's about a water sprite...

517
00:38:40,175 --> 00:38:42,175
that falls in love
with a human man.

518
00:38:43,578 --> 00:38:44,879
Please stay.

519
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,979
Sounds like such
a wonderful story.

520
00:38:49,284 --> 00:38:51,718
All right, if you insist.

521
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:53,488
We'll read it
through once...

522
00:38:53,588 --> 00:38:56,557
see what you think, and
then if you like it, we can...

523
00:38:56,658 --> 00:38:58,956
do it on Broadway
with Alfred Lunt directing?

524
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,756
Alfred Lunt.
What a wonderful idea.

525
00:39:01,863 --> 00:39:04,331
It's more than an idea.

526
00:39:04,432 --> 00:39:07,595
He'll do it, if you will.
I have that in writing.

527
00:39:10,205 --> 00:39:12,205
It's by Giraudoux.

528
00:39:13,908 --> 00:39:16,843
"And in the end,
I shall do it, but first...

529
00:39:16,945 --> 00:39:19,175
first we shall wait
a long time.

530
00:39:21,282 --> 00:39:22,951
An hour.

531
00:39:23,051 --> 00:39:27,545
Then, in years to come, we shall
have this hour always to remember.

532
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:29,748
The hour before
you kissed me."

533
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:38,563
It's wonderful.
- You're wonderful.

534
00:39:39,834 --> 00:39:42,894
God. It's like
it was written for you.

535
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,742
I'll take care
of everything.

536
00:39:47,842 --> 00:39:50,333
I'll fight all your battles,
I'll slay all your dragons...

537
00:39:50,445 --> 00:39:54,040
and all you have to do is be
your own lovely self on stage.

538
00:39:54,148 --> 00:39:56,148
Say you'll do it.

539
00:39:56,351 --> 00:39:58,351
I'll do it.

540
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,890
Thank you.

541
00:40:10,932 --> 00:40:13,628
All right, ladies
and gentlemen, please.

542
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:16,203
Let's work on
this armor business.

543
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:17,705
Alfred, I'm thinking...

544
00:40:17,805 --> 00:40:20,569
I could release the armor
when she comes to embrace me.

545
00:40:20,675 --> 00:40:23,303
No, the play says
that the armor falls off...

546
00:40:23,411 --> 00:40:25,380
immediately after
she says the line.

547
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,448
What is the line?
- Right, but hear me out.

548
00:40:27,548 --> 00:40:29,982
I think it would be much funnier
if she said the line...

549
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:31,653
from where she
was standing--

550
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:32,720
Say the line.

551
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,820
I have a way
of removing armor.

552
00:40:34,922 --> 00:40:36,658
Came around behind me...

553
00:40:36,758 --> 00:40:38,758
and mysteriously
the armor...

554
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:41,494
falls off.

555
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,196
I don't think we can
rewrite the play, Mel.

556
00:40:48,303 --> 00:40:51,204
Let's try to get it
to work as written.

557
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:02,677
My name is Ondine.

558
00:41:02,784 --> 00:41:06,720
The King of the Sea said ifl
ever kissed you, I would be lost.

559
00:41:06,821 --> 00:41:08,821
Are you thinking of it?

560
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:10,792
Very much.

561
00:41:10,892 --> 00:41:12,892
Well, there's no harm
in thinking.

562
00:41:20,568 --> 00:41:23,401
It's going very well tonight.

563
00:41:23,504 --> 00:41:25,406
I can't watch.

564
00:41:25,506 --> 00:41:28,236
I could never watch the opening
of any of my plays.

565
00:41:29,977 --> 00:41:32,571
Mr. Lunt,
Audrey looks exhausted.

566
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,582
How long do you think
the play will run?

567
00:41:34,682 --> 00:41:36,741
I think the critics
will determine that.

568
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,346
I'm afraid Mel will try to
keep her in it until she drops dead.

569
00:41:42,457 --> 00:41:44,721
Yes, well,
putting up with Mel...

570
00:41:44,826 --> 00:41:47,386
is the price you have to pay
for having Audrey.

571
00:41:51,766 --> 00:41:53,893
Bravo! Bravo!

572
00:41:56,604 --> 00:41:57,905
They love it.

573
00:41:58,005 --> 00:41:59,474
They love her!

574
00:41:59,574 --> 00:42:01,974
Well done, Alfred.
Got a real hit on your hands.

575
00:42:11,486 --> 00:42:12,720
I love you too.

576
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:15,721
I'm sorry I fell asleep
so fast last night.

577
00:42:15,823 --> 00:42:18,656
I wanted to thank you for making
this experience perfect for me.

578
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,632
I got another bouquet
for you, Miss Hepburn...

579
00:42:24,732 --> 00:42:26,134
and this telegram just arrived.

580
00:42:26,234 --> 00:42:28,234
Thanks, Frankie.

581
00:42:30,972 --> 00:42:35,033
You're gonna need a special room just
to keep all these flowers, Miss Hepburn.

582
00:42:36,477 --> 00:42:38,313
Smells great, though.

583
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:41,007
Better make that
two rooms, Frankie.

584
00:42:41,115 --> 00:42:44,812
Miss Hepburn has just been
nominated for an Oscar.

585
00:42:44,919 --> 00:42:46,919
An Oscar!

586
00:42:51,225 --> 00:42:52,944
And the nominations
for Best Actress...

587
00:42:53,044 --> 00:42:55,711
in a feature
motion picture are:

588
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:58,061
Audrey Hepburn
for Roman Holiday.

589
00:43:00,701 --> 00:43:02,270
She looks tired.

590
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,038
I know.
- Leslie Caron for Lili.

591
00:43:04,138 --> 00:43:06,040
I'd take her away for a rest...

592
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,109
but the press is accusing me
of being a Svengali...

593
00:43:08,209 --> 00:43:09,344
controlling her every move.

594
00:43:09,444 --> 00:43:12,345
So now they have the idea
that she is very weak.

595
00:43:12,447 --> 00:43:16,008
Deborah Kerr for
From Here To Eternity.

596
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:19,951
It would be easier to take her away
if you'd let me marry her.

597
00:43:21,422 --> 00:43:23,720
You don't need my consent
to marry her.

598
00:43:24,826 --> 00:43:25,860
Have you asked her?

599
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:28,019
Ava Gardner for Mogambo.

600
00:43:28,129 --> 00:43:30,129
I'm going to.

601
00:43:30,231 --> 00:43:31,899
Tonight, at the party.

602
00:43:31,999 --> 00:43:33,999
She wants children, you know.

603
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:37,470
Are you prepared
to have more children?

604
00:43:38,806 --> 00:43:40,241
As many as she wants.

605
00:43:40,341 --> 00:43:44,710
And Maggie McNamara
for The Moon Is Blue.

606
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:48,481
Here we go.

607
00:43:49,784 --> 00:43:52,275
And the winner is...

608
00:43:52,386 --> 00:43:55,048
Audrey Hepburn
for Roman Holiday!

609
00:44:10,805 --> 00:44:12,898
I'd Iike to thank my mother...

610
00:44:13,007 --> 00:44:15,498
who taught me
to stand up straight...

611
00:44:15,610 --> 00:44:19,478
sit erect, use discipline
with wine and sweets...

612
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,072
and only smoke
six cigarettes a day.

613
00:44:24,919 --> 00:44:27,149
I hope the two of you
will be very happy.

614
00:44:31,626 --> 00:44:33,685
I promise you, Ella...

615
00:44:33,794 --> 00:44:36,763
I will take care of her
for the rest of her life.

616
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,881
Those reporters have followed us
all the way from the chapel.

617
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:07,483
I'm sorry, darling.
I don't know how they found us.

618
00:45:07,595 --> 00:45:10,223
Don't they understand that
this is a very private day?

619
00:45:10,331 --> 00:45:12,300
Let me do the talking.

620
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,400
Miss Hepburn!

621
00:45:17,572 --> 00:45:20,473
Yes, we were married
this morning in Burgenstock.

622
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:23,009
We intend to make our
home here in Switzerland.

623
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:25,840
It was just a private ceremony
for family and friends.

624
00:45:29,450 --> 00:45:31,748
Thank you so much
for your best wishes.

625
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:35,219
Now, please, the roads
are narrow. Drive carefully.

626
00:45:35,323 --> 00:45:37,323
That's all, gentlemen.

627
00:45:39,994 --> 00:45:41,994
I love it here so much.

628
00:45:42,096 --> 00:45:45,088
Another week, and I'll turn
into a country housewife.

629
00:45:45,199 --> 00:45:47,724
The most radiant
country housewife in history.

630
00:45:49,537 --> 00:45:54,440
Why don't we both stop doing movies
for a while and just enjoy each other?

631
00:45:54,542 --> 00:45:56,477
Are you kidding?
Nothing would make me happier.

632
00:45:56,577 --> 00:46:00,445
But your fans would kill me if I
kept you all to myself. You know that.

633
00:46:00,548 --> 00:46:03,039
I want to have a baby.

634
00:46:03,150 --> 00:46:06,449
I want to see what our babies
look like. I want to hold them.

635
00:46:06,554 --> 00:46:08,554
Right away?
- Right away.

636
00:46:09,357 --> 00:46:11,825
All right. I guess I'll have
to tell Fred Astaire no.

637
00:46:12,627 --> 00:46:14,627
Fred Astaire?

638
00:46:16,597 --> 00:46:17,865
It's called Funny Face.

639
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:19,934
Shooting all over Paris,
even inside the Louvre.

640
00:46:20,034 --> 00:46:22,229
Oh, but I haven't danced
in such a long time.

641
00:46:22,336 --> 00:46:23,471
I know.

642
00:46:23,571 --> 00:46:26,096
Still, it would be wonderful
to film in Paris.

643
00:46:26,207 --> 00:46:29,176
Do you think I could do it?
- I know you could.

644
00:46:29,276 --> 00:46:31,972
Well, then tell them
I would be honored to do it.

645
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,479
Unless I get pregnant, and
then some other lucky actress...

646
00:46:34,582 --> 00:46:36,846
will get to dance
with Fred Astaire.

647
00:46:36,951 --> 00:46:38,019
What are those?

648
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:41,054
The contracts for the other two films
you've been thinking about.

649
00:46:41,155 --> 00:46:43,124
Nun's Story and
Love In The Afternoon.

650
00:46:43,224 --> 00:46:46,193
Well, I have to do
Love In The Afternoon.

651
00:46:46,293 --> 00:46:48,095
I promised Mr.
Cooper I would.

652
00:46:48,195 --> 00:46:50,288
Sweetheart, I think
you can call him Gary.

653
00:46:51,465 --> 00:46:53,558
And I want to do The
Nun's Story to be in Africa...

654
00:46:53,668 --> 00:46:55,469
when you're scouting
locations for your movie.

655
00:46:55,569 --> 00:46:57,371
I don't think that's
the only reason to do it.

656
00:46:57,471 --> 00:46:59,666
Well, no, of course not.

657
00:46:59,774 --> 00:47:02,038
I want to do a
serious role. I'm ready.

658
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:04,338
Of course you are.

659
00:47:04,445 --> 00:47:07,505
But how can I get pregnant
if I'm working all the time?

660
00:47:08,649 --> 00:47:10,551
Let's just assume
from here on in...

661
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:13,552
that any time you're
shooting a film, I'm there.

662
00:47:13,654 --> 00:47:16,054
That is, you know,
unless you say no.

663
00:47:16,157 --> 00:47:18,216
Why would I do that?

664
00:47:18,325 --> 00:47:21,658
The only man that I want
to say yes to is you.

665
00:47:34,775 --> 00:47:37,573
The Nun's Story, scene
42-apple, take 5. Marker.

666
00:47:41,549 --> 00:47:44,882
Audrey, I have
a lovely surprise for you.

667
00:47:44,985 --> 00:47:48,318
Audrey Hepburn,
meet Marie Louise Habets...

668
00:47:48,422 --> 00:47:50,822
the former Sister Luc.

669
00:47:50,925 --> 00:47:54,122
How do you do? It's such
an honor to finally meet you.

670
00:47:54,228 --> 00:47:57,288
Miss Hepburn,
I share the honor.

671
00:47:57,398 --> 00:47:59,525
I am very nervous
about playing you.

672
00:47:59,633 --> 00:48:03,000
I hope that I will be able to help
people understand you and your work.

673
00:48:03,104 --> 00:48:04,572
Thank you very much.

674
00:48:04,672 --> 00:48:07,641
I was just on my way
to the clinic--

675
00:48:07,742 --> 00:48:09,243
the real one.

676
00:48:09,343 --> 00:48:11,343
Would you like
to walk over with me?

677
00:48:12,279 --> 00:48:15,305
Go ahead. We won't
be ready here for an hour.

678
00:48:16,150 --> 00:48:18,345
I'd love to.
Please, lead the way.

679
00:48:25,159 --> 00:48:27,128
How many children
are treated here?

680
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:31,164
Very few, actually, compared to
the thousands who need help.

681
00:48:31,265 --> 00:48:33,529
There are whole continents
of sick children.

682
00:48:33,634 --> 00:48:37,832
Their parents are no better off,
struggling to care for them.

683
00:48:39,573 --> 00:48:42,007
Yet, not enough people
seem to notice.

684
00:48:44,111 --> 00:48:48,912
I honestly didn't know
how desperate the situation was.

685
00:48:49,016 --> 00:48:52,611
It's so unfair that the children
have to start their lives like this.

686
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:57,090
Do you plan to have
any children of your own?

687
00:48:57,191 --> 00:49:00,490
We want them very much,
but so far, no luck.

688
00:49:00,594 --> 00:49:03,256
I think the children
will come when it's time.

689
00:49:03,364 --> 00:49:05,332
Rest is all that you need.

690
00:49:05,432 --> 00:49:08,993
I have another film to do
after this in Mexico.

691
00:49:09,103 --> 00:49:11,005
Maybe then I'll
take some time off.

692
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:14,370
I see that you have
a very full life.

693
00:49:14,475 --> 00:49:16,277
Throughout so
much of my life...

694
00:49:16,377 --> 00:49:20,040
people have come along to take care
of me as if I were a little girl.

695
00:49:20,147 --> 00:49:22,672
But you seem so comfortable
with yourself...

696
00:49:22,783 --> 00:49:24,585
and so comforting to others.

697
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:27,153
Maybe I'm finally learning
how to look after myself.

698
00:49:29,356 --> 00:49:31,381
But the children...

699
00:49:31,492 --> 00:49:34,290
the ones who live here.

700
00:49:34,395 --> 00:49:36,395
They're the ones
who really need the help.

701
00:49:48,042 --> 00:49:50,042
Hello.

702
00:49:50,377 --> 00:49:52,377
I missed you. Zinnemann.

703
00:49:53,747 --> 00:49:56,113
I'm so happy
you came to see me.

704
00:49:56,217 --> 00:49:58,447
Look at you. I hear
the rushes look terrific.

705
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:00,713
I feel so peaceful here.

706
00:50:01,956 --> 00:50:04,015
Sister Luc tells me you're
wonderful with the children.

707
00:50:05,226 --> 00:50:08,093
I never wonder
what I'm doing here.

708
00:50:08,195 --> 00:50:12,097
I'm sure it must make the world
of movies seem less important.

709
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:14,101
Yes.

710
00:50:14,201 --> 00:50:17,864
Sometimes I feel like I'm
nothing more than a show horse...

711
00:50:17,972 --> 00:50:21,806
all tricked out in fancy ribbons,
being led around a ring.

712
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:25,106
Audrey, the audience
doesn't feel that way.

713
00:50:25,212 --> 00:50:27,544
They think you're up there
just to make them happy...

714
00:50:27,648 --> 00:50:29,550
and the miracle is,
you actually do.

715
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:33,017
Sweetheart, you've given
a whole generation of girls...

716
00:50:33,120 --> 00:50:36,715
a sense that something else
was possible in life.

717
00:50:38,025 --> 00:50:40,025
Thin girls.

718
00:50:41,228 --> 00:50:43,788
Maybe you don't know
what a difference you've made.

719
00:50:43,898 --> 00:50:46,799
But no, no, it's
not just "thin girls."

720
00:50:48,102 --> 00:50:49,503
It's all of them--

721
00:50:49,603 --> 00:50:52,299
young women who want more...

722
00:50:53,674 --> 00:50:55,674
who want to be able
to speak their minds...

723
00:50:55,776 --> 00:50:58,973
who've always known there was
something they were supposed to do.

724
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,049
They all look up to you.

725
00:51:02,149 --> 00:51:04,743
You took what you had,
and look what you made of it.

726
00:51:05,853 --> 00:51:07,588
And that...

727
00:51:07,688 --> 00:51:09,688
that is your real gift.

728
00:51:10,925 --> 00:51:14,122
I have missed you so much.

729
00:51:15,229 --> 00:51:17,424
Nobody talks to me
the way you do.

730
00:51:24,204 --> 00:51:27,696
As we reported earlier, Audrey Hepburn,
beloved star of stage and film...

731
00:51:27,808 --> 00:51:30,538
was thrown by a horse today
while shooting a John Huston film...

732
00:51:30,644 --> 00:51:32,012
in Durango, Mexico.

733
00:51:32,112 --> 00:51:35,275
Miss Hepburn is reported in
critical but stable condition...

734
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:39,580
with neck and back injuries, and will be
flown home for treatment later today.

735
00:51:39,687 --> 00:51:42,485
Sources close to Miss Hepburn report
that she 's several months pregnant...

736
00:51:42,589 --> 00:51:43,991
with her first child.

737
00:51:44,091 --> 00:51:46,889
Audrey Hepburn 's husband,
actor and director Mel Ferrer...

738
00:51:46,994 --> 00:51:50,020
flew to Mexico to
accompany her back for treatment.

739
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:52,462
The doctor says the baby
is in no danger.

740
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:54,898
The heartbeat is normal,
movement is normal.

741
00:51:55,002 --> 00:51:57,937
Now all we have to do
is convince Audrey to relax.

742
00:51:59,707 --> 00:52:01,707
Oh, darling!

743
00:52:02,209 --> 00:52:03,844
I've been so worried!

744
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:05,944
I'm so glad you're here.

745
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:08,378
Where else would I be
when you need me?

746
00:52:08,482 --> 00:52:10,950
Sweetheart, you shouldn't
be doing this now.

747
00:52:11,051 --> 00:52:13,417
Let's send the mail home
so you can get rest.

748
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:16,387
Yes. You should be
taking it easy now.

749
00:52:18,258 --> 00:52:21,955
When do I ever get to
lie around and read my mail?

750
00:52:22,062 --> 00:52:24,428
I'm going to answer
every piece.

751
00:52:24,531 --> 00:52:27,056
Besides, Caroline's doing
most of the work.

752
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,840
What?

753
00:52:35,009 --> 00:52:37,009
What is it?

754
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:51,390
It's from my father.

755
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:57,062
"I fear that you haven't...

756
00:52:58,132 --> 00:53:00,132
received my other letters...

757
00:53:01,802 --> 00:53:04,066
because you've
never answered.

758
00:53:05,906 --> 00:53:09,103
Still, I don't know what to do
except continue to write them."

759
00:53:14,615 --> 00:53:16,742
What other letters?

760
00:53:18,919 --> 00:53:20,919
Mother?

761
00:53:24,391 --> 00:53:26,791
Did Father send me
other letters?

762
00:53:29,396 --> 00:53:30,364
Yes.

763
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:33,194
You kept his letters from me?

764
00:53:47,714 --> 00:53:49,450
You kept his letters from me.

765
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,643
I didn't want
him to hurt you.

766
00:53:51,752 --> 00:53:54,949
How could he hurt me?
- He's hurt everyone he ever knew.

767
00:53:56,156 --> 00:53:59,455
Why would he try to get
in touch with me only to hurt me?

768
00:53:59,560 --> 00:54:00,627
You're just jealous.

769
00:54:00,727 --> 00:54:03,218
I'm not jealous.
I was trying to protect you.

770
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:05,330
You had no right to do this.

771
00:54:05,432 --> 00:54:08,333
Don't get in touch with him.
- Don't tell me what to do.

772
00:54:08,435 --> 00:54:11,029
He hasn't given up his
politics. He never will.

773
00:54:11,138 --> 00:54:13,504
He's an old man now, Mother.
What could he do?

774
00:54:13,607 --> 00:54:16,474
He could hurt your career.
- You're wrong.

775
00:54:16,577 --> 00:54:18,602
He could blame you for
the fact that he left us.

776
00:54:18,712 --> 00:54:21,681
He could twist it all up and make it
all your fault. You don't understand.

777
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:25,552
What's the matter, darling?

778
00:54:25,652 --> 00:54:27,652
I don't know.

779
00:54:28,789 --> 00:54:30,789
I don't know.

780
00:54:31,358 --> 00:54:35,795
The baby. No, please,
don't let it be the baby.

781
00:54:35,896 --> 00:54:37,896
I'll get a doctor.

782
00:54:40,434 --> 00:54:42,036
Doctor!

783
00:54:42,136 --> 00:54:44,136
Mother?

784
00:54:44,638 --> 00:54:47,198
Nurse? Is somebody there?

785
00:54:48,909 --> 00:54:51,969
Doctor! Can someone help us, please?
- Mother!

786
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,079
Doctor!

787
00:55:41,061 --> 00:55:43,061
Hello, Father.

788
00:55:43,864 --> 00:55:46,389
Well, you best come in.

789
00:55:53,607 --> 00:55:56,508
I wanted to say thank you...

790
00:55:58,178 --> 00:56:00,080
for writing to me.

791
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:03,081
I only wish I had
received your letters.

792
00:56:05,018 --> 00:56:09,921
Your mother never-- She
didn't want me to talk to you.

793
00:56:18,065 --> 00:56:20,065
I don't have any sugar.

794
00:56:20,968 --> 00:56:23,129
I don't take sugar.

795
00:56:23,237 --> 00:56:25,237
Thank you.

796
00:56:47,761 --> 00:56:50,924
Well--
- I'm so happy to see you.

797
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:56,496
I'm not proud
of what I did, Audrey.

798
00:56:56,603 --> 00:56:59,504
Leaving you, I mean.
- I don't hold it against you.

799
00:57:00,607 --> 00:57:02,607
I've just missed you so much.

800
00:57:04,911 --> 00:57:07,311
You couldn't have missed me
that much. You hardly knew me.

801
00:57:07,414 --> 00:57:11,475
Well, you didn't know me
very well either.

802
00:57:12,586 --> 00:57:14,586
Didn't you miss me?

803
00:57:20,627 --> 00:57:22,627
Your husband told me
you lost the baby.

804
00:57:22,729 --> 00:57:24,698
I did. Yes.

805
00:57:24,798 --> 00:57:27,232
I told him you shouldn't
have ridden that horse.

806
00:57:27,334 --> 00:57:29,334
The script required it.

807
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:32,732
Arabians don't like women.
They only trust men.

808
00:57:34,341 --> 00:57:37,868
Your fancy cowboys
should have known that.

809
00:57:37,978 --> 00:57:40,469
You never should have ridden it.
- I'm all right now.

810
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:43,549
The doctor says that
we can have another baby.

811
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,286
If there's something
that you need to be doing...

812
00:57:58,031 --> 00:57:59,499
go ahead.

813
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:01,599
I'm fine just
sitting here.

814
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,240
All right, then.

815
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:15,716
Come on, boy.

816
00:58:15,816 --> 00:58:17,816
Come on.

817
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,560
What's his name?

818
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:31,229
Otto.

819
00:58:32,766 --> 00:58:34,766
I have a dog.

820
00:58:36,903 --> 00:58:40,805
They say the intelligence level of dogs
is that of a two-year-old child.

821
00:58:42,342 --> 00:58:44,606
I think they know
much more than that.

822
00:58:47,047 --> 00:58:49,447
They certainly know
how to get your attention.

823
00:58:51,752 --> 00:58:53,752
Cats too.

824
00:58:55,455 --> 00:58:57,357
I had a cat in London...

825
00:58:57,457 --> 00:58:59,482
when I was first
trying to work there.

826
00:59:01,862 --> 00:59:03,862
I called him Tomorrow.

827
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:11,765
And whenever I had a day
full of humiliating rejections...

828
00:59:11,872 --> 00:59:13,872
I would pick up that cat
and I would say...

829
00:59:13,974 --> 00:59:16,670
" Everything is going
to be all right, Tomorrow."

830
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,000
Thank you for seeing me.

831
00:59:44,571 --> 00:59:45,672
You're my daughter.

832
00:59:45,772 --> 00:59:49,139
Would you please come
and visit us in Switzerland?

833
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:53,201
You can bring Otto if you like.
I could send you a ticket.

834
00:59:54,414 --> 00:59:56,780
No, no.
It's too far for me now.

835
00:59:56,883 --> 01:00:00,341
I best just stay here.

836
01:00:00,454 --> 01:00:03,116
I don't like to leave the place
with nobody to watch it.

837
01:00:06,026 --> 01:00:09,052
Well, then I'll just have to
come back and visit you.

838
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:12,199
You don't have to do that.

839
01:00:12,299 --> 01:00:14,299
But I want to.

840
01:00:17,103 --> 01:00:19,867
I'm not cut out
to be a father, Audrey.

841
01:00:19,973 --> 01:00:21,973
I wasn't then,
and I'm not now.

842
01:00:23,844 --> 01:00:25,746
Why don't you
want to see me?

843
01:00:25,846 --> 01:00:28,747
The whole world
loves you, Audrey.

844
01:00:30,484 --> 01:00:32,484
You don't need me.

845
01:00:35,489 --> 01:00:37,489
Good-bye, Father.

846
01:00:40,494 --> 01:00:42,494
Good-bye, Audrey.

847
01:01:47,894 --> 01:01:50,988
I'm sorry I thought
such terrible things--

848
01:01:51,097 --> 01:01:53,156
that I said
such terrible things.

849
01:01:54,267 --> 01:01:56,267
I'm sorry he hurt you.

850
01:01:57,304 --> 01:02:01,172
I should have listened to you.
- It's all right.

851
01:02:01,274 --> 01:02:03,469
Perhaps I was wrong
to try to protect you from him.

852
01:02:03,577 --> 01:02:05,704
I just thought
if I could see him--

853
01:02:07,180 --> 01:02:08,448
What happened to him?

854
01:02:08,548 --> 01:02:10,548
I don't know.

855
01:02:11,585 --> 01:02:15,646
It's as if he stepped onto a
moving sidewalk and it took him away.

856
01:02:17,324 --> 01:02:19,417
I'm going to keep trying
to have a baby.

857
01:02:19,526 --> 01:02:20,994
Good. I'm glad.

858
01:02:21,094 --> 01:02:23,995
I think Mel wants me
to wait a little while.

859
01:02:24,097 --> 01:02:26,429
The studio wants me
to do another movie right away.

860
01:02:26,533 --> 01:02:28,533
What are you going to do?

861
01:02:29,869 --> 01:02:31,869
I'm going to have a baby.

862
01:02:36,943 --> 01:02:38,044
Name this child.

863
01:02:38,144 --> 01:02:39,880
Sean.

864
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:43,313
Sean, I baptize thee
in the name of the Father...

865
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:45,385
and of the Son...

866
01:02:45,485 --> 01:02:47,387
and of the Holy Ghost.

867
01:02:47,487 --> 01:02:48,455
Amen.

868
01:02:48,555 --> 01:02:50,555
Amen.

869
01:02:54,861 --> 01:02:56,861
My child.

870
01:03:02,302 --> 01:03:04,361
I just got off the phone
with the studio.

871
01:03:04,471 --> 01:03:06,996
We need to give them an answer
about Breakfast at Tiffany's.

872
01:03:07,107 --> 01:03:09,009
Call them back
and say no, of course.

873
01:03:09,109 --> 01:03:11,109
I can't play a call girl.

874
01:03:12,479 --> 01:03:14,447
You know, she
isn't really a call girl.

875
01:03:14,547 --> 01:03:17,107
We never actually see her
calling on anyone.

876
01:03:17,217 --> 01:03:18,685
Oh, all right, then.

877
01:03:18,785 --> 01:03:21,720
She's a kookwho carries
messages for a mob boss...

878
01:03:21,821 --> 01:03:23,790
while still trying
to find a rich boyfriend.

879
01:03:23,890 --> 01:03:24,891
It's not me.

880
01:03:24,991 --> 01:03:27,323
I gotta tell you,
I like the story.

881
01:03:29,663 --> 01:03:31,722
Here's what I think.

882
01:03:31,831 --> 01:03:35,198
It's about a beautiful young woman
who's having a wonderful time...

883
01:03:35,301 --> 01:03:37,861
but still feels
a little lost.

884
01:03:37,971 --> 01:03:40,439
You know? She doesn't
really know where she belongs.

885
01:03:40,540 --> 01:03:41,942
Where does she belong?

886
01:03:42,042 --> 01:03:45,068
Oh, with the struggling artist
that loves her, of course.

887
01:03:45,178 --> 01:03:47,738
You really do like it?

888
01:03:47,847 --> 01:03:50,748
I just think Holly's different
than any character you've ever played.

889
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:53,683
It's a complex script,
but it's still very emotional.

890
01:03:53,787 --> 01:03:56,415
You wanted your next picture
to be a bit more modern.

891
01:03:56,523 --> 01:03:59,287
I don't want to leave you
and the baby.

892
01:03:59,392 --> 01:04:02,657
Sweetheart, if that's all it is,
Sean would love to go.

893
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,889
He told me this morning.
He said, " Dad...

894
01:04:04,998 --> 01:04:07,626
Switzerland's nice, but I'd
really like to see New York."

895
01:04:13,373 --> 01:04:15,373
Hang on.
Be right back.

896
01:04:32,726 --> 01:04:34,726
Here you are.
One nameless cat.

897
01:04:35,695 --> 01:04:37,695
Hello, cat.

898
01:04:39,466 --> 01:04:40,567
Listen, Audrey...

899
01:04:40,667 --> 01:04:43,636
apparently we only have
enough rain for one take.

900
01:04:43,737 --> 01:04:46,069
Can you do it?
- Is he threatening me?

901
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:51,108
I read the script, but I don't get why
she puts the cat out of the taxi.

902
01:04:54,881 --> 01:04:58,647
Holly Golightly puts the cat out
because Holly is the cat.

903
01:04:59,819 --> 01:05:01,121
That's right.

904
01:05:01,221 --> 01:05:04,588
She doesn't have a real name.
Neither does the cat.

905
01:05:06,059 --> 01:05:10,792
She feels homeless
and unloved and unlovable...

906
01:05:10,897 --> 01:05:12,132
just like the cat.

907
01:05:12,232 --> 01:05:15,633
So, when she goes back
to find the cat, it means--

908
01:05:15,735 --> 01:05:18,795
Excuse me. Audrey? The taxi's ready.
- Right.

909
01:05:18,905 --> 01:05:21,703
Can we stand by
with the rain, please?

910
01:05:21,808 --> 01:05:23,610
Stand by for the rain!

911
01:05:23,710 --> 01:05:26,611
So, when she goes back
to find the cat...

912
01:05:26,713 --> 01:05:29,409
it means that she's finally
accepted herself--

913
01:05:29,516 --> 01:05:32,610
that she can love herself
even though she's a scrawny...

914
01:05:32,719 --> 01:05:34,949
soaking wet no-name cat.

915
01:05:36,756 --> 01:05:38,951
It's not a bad thing to be.

916
01:05:58,845 --> 01:06:00,547
Okay, cue the rain.

917
01:06:00,647 --> 01:06:02,647
Cue the rain, please!

918
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:06,083
Roll camera!

919
01:06:07,253 --> 01:06:10,154
Mark it!
- Scene 1 88, shot 1, take 1, marker.

920
01:06:12,325 --> 01:06:14,325
And action!

921
01:06:27,774 --> 01:06:29,774
Cat!

922
01:06:30,877 --> 01:06:32,877
Cat!

923
01:06:34,247 --> 01:06:36,247
Cat!

924
01:06:44,691 --> 01:06:46,750
Where is he?
- I don't know.

925
01:06:47,994 --> 01:06:49,994
Cat?

926
01:06:50,864 --> 01:06:52,864
Cat!

927
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:55,199
Oh, cat.

928
01:07:08,114 --> 01:07:10,114
It's nice.

929
01:07:15,355 --> 01:07:17,023
And cut it!

930
01:07:17,123 --> 01:07:19,123
That's a cut!

931
01:07:25,431 --> 01:07:27,626
Thank you, everybody!
That's a wrap!

932
01:07:28,626 --> 01:07:38,626
