00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,274
<i>Mon capitaine!</i>

3
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:15,324
Orders from Headquarters, Sir

4
00:01:37,763 --> 00:01:38,806
The orders...

5
00:01:40,808 --> 00:01:41,851
are to attack the bridge.

6
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,980
We can expect heavy casualties.

7
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,400
No-one will reach that bridge alive.

8
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,112
Find your nerve, men.

9
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,156
We risk our lives

10
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,074
but we can take back our home!

11
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,662
For centuries,
poets have dreamt of dying for love.

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,082
I suppose we shall be the lucky ones.

13
00:02:06,792 --> 00:02:09,754
The orders are to wait three hours
for the wind to turn east

14
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,757
then fire every gas canister we have.

15
00:02:18,804 --> 00:02:20,598
There is an alternative, Captain.

16
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,978
What is it, Poirot?

17
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,647
We attack right now.

18
00:02:28,939 --> 00:02:29,690
Now?

19
00:02:29,857 --> 00:02:30,566
Yes.

20
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,777
Within the next seven minutes.

21
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:34,111
Perhaps eight.

22
00:02:35,988 --> 00:02:36,655
Every morning

23
00:02:36,822 --> 00:02:38,199
the petrels take flight

24
00:02:38,532 --> 00:02:41,077
just before the wind turns east.

25
00:02:41,577 --> 00:02:42,453
You see?

26
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,330
This morning

27
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:46,248
they fly early.

28
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,126
The wind conditions are ideal now

29
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,921
to hide our advance.

30
00:02:52,838 --> 00:02:53,672
Hidden by the gas

31
00:02:53,839 --> 00:02:57,635
we will cross 200 metres of no man's land
without being seen.

32
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,512
Before the enemy even knows

33
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:01,347
that we attack!

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,600
If you're wrong, the wind will blow the
gas back on the rest of our army.

35
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,103
We gas ourselves as they Kill us,
that's what you want?

36
00:03:08,145 --> 00:03:09,355
I am not wrong.

37
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,395
It's an ambush.

38
00:03:55,651 --> 00:03:57,403
I can't see them.

39
00:04:03,242 --> 00:04:05,161
Retreat!

40
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:25,514
You were right!

41
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,477
You are too sharp to be a farmer, Poirot.

42
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:33,481
<i>Non! Capitaine!</i>

43
00:05:05,221 --> 00:05:07,598
I asked you not to come.

44
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,437
I'm a nurse, too.

45
00:05:15,689 --> 00:05:17,900
I heard there was a wounded soldier

46
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,529
whose instincts on the battlefield
saved his entire company.

47
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,283
I did not save my captain.

48
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:33,123
And you agreed to marry me
before all of this.

49
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,711
Katherine, you should go.

50
00:05:38,003 --> 00:05:40,422
Do you have any idea how love works?

51
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:44,176
When you love someone, you love them

52
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:48,681
through all their moods
and changes over time.

53
00:05:49,306 --> 00:05:51,809
Their worst qualities peak at nuisance.

54
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,853
Their flaws become freckles.

55
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,941
And as it happens...

56
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,987
I love you.

57
00:06:03,779 --> 00:06:05,698
What about this?

58
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,920
Come here.

59
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,430
Simple.

60
00:06:32,641 --> 00:06:34,727
You'll grow a moustache.

61
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,727
Poirot! Where you been?

62
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:18,771
The Arundell mystery?
Are you "with case"?

63
00:07:18,937 --> 00:07:20,189
No, I am with hunger.

64
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,733
Monsieur Blondin!

65
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,319
Monsieur Poirot, you solved the case
in Egypt.

66
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,112
It was a great success.
But I must return.

67
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,781
And tonight is gonna be...

68
00:07:29,156 --> 00:07:30,157
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

69
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,118
One of every dessert on the menu
is on its way.

70
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:36,747
Anything else Mr. Poirot wants, just ask.

71
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,670
The whole house is wondering
why there's no music.

72
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,464
There's no music
because no money's been paid.

73
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,675
I pay everyone at the end of the night.

74
00:07:47,841 --> 00:07:49,468
Well, in my experience,

75
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:54,098
men who run such upright,
quality establishments like yours,

76
00:07:54,264 --> 00:07:56,934
lose their wallets when the bill comes.

77
00:07:57,309 --> 00:07:59,436
I'm betting you already forgot my name.

78
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:00,979
Rosalie Otterbourne.

79
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:04,191
I'm not just Salome Otterbourne's manager,
I'm her niece.

80
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,944
She'll retire wealthy,
and I'll see to that.

81
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,905
And we get paid up front.

82
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,282
So if you want a little music,

83
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:13,909
first, I wanna see a stack of green

84
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,744
or whatever color money is
in your country.

85
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,086
You remember my name now.

86
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,633
Ladies and gentlemen!

87
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,677
Salome Otterbourne!

88
00:09:00,497 --> 00:09:05,085
<i>I wanna tell you the natural facts</i>

89
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:09,757
<i>That a man don't understand
The good book right</i>

90
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:12,009
<i>And that's all</i>

91
00:09:15,554 --> 00:09:17,556
<i>That's all</i>

92
00:09:19,099 --> 00:09:22,352
<i>You know what?
We got to have more love</i>

93
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:25,814
<i>More understanding every day of our lives</i>

94
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,858
<i>And that's all</i>

95
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:34,406
<i>Now when you see folks jump</i>

96
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,035
<i>From this or that</i>

97
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:42,122
<i>They don't know, they don't know
Where in the devil they're at</i>

98
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,458
<i>And that's all</i>

99
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:08,440
<i>Listen, people fighting one another</i>

100
00:10:08,607 --> 00:10:11,276
<i>And think they're doing swell</i>

101
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:14,279
<i>And all they want is your money</i>

102
00:10:14,446 --> 00:10:17,741
<i>And you can go to...
And that's all</i>

103
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,622
<i>That's all</i>

104
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,256
<i>Y'all got to have religion</i>

105
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:36,009
<i>I tell ya, that's all</i>

106
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,055
Miss Ridge way!

107
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,393
Linnet!

108
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,062
Miss Ridge way!
Miss Ridge way, please!

109
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:48,313
Come on, give us a smile!

110
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,566
- Miss Ridge way!
- Give us a smile!

111
00:10:50,732 --> 00:10:53,235
Stand back, please.
Make way for Miss Ridge way.

112
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,530
<i>Up above my head</i>

113
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:57,948
<i>Up above my head</i>

114
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,867
<i>I hear music in the air</i>

115
00:11:22,764 --> 00:11:24,182
Miss Linnet Ridge way,

116
00:11:24,266 --> 00:11:25,893
I can't tell you what an honor it is.

117
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,855
<i>Merci.</i> We have the... There are seven.

118
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,648
Indeed. Seven of the very finest, sir.

119
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:33,525
I do not want seven.
I want only the six.

120
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:36,028
I cannot have, uh, the uneven number.

121
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,238
Ah, now we have the even number.
This is good.

122
00:11:38,405 --> 00:11:39,865
Which should I take away? I do not know.

123
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,075
No, not my little friend, please.
Thank you so much.

124
00:11:42,242 --> 00:11:43,368
Thank you very, very much.

125
00:11:43,535 --> 00:11:45,329
It is, you see, my little...

126
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,541
Linnet.

127
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:53,921
It's not fair looking like that
and getting to be you.

128
00:11:54,087 --> 00:11:57,466
Oh, well, I asked Louise to pick out
something special to see my Jacks.

129
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,800
It's been ages.

130
00:12:01,261 --> 00:12:03,263
Engaged?

131
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:07,059
- I know.
- But who?

132
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:11,605
He's big, and square, and boyish,
and beautifully simple.

133
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:14,441
And that's it.
He's called Simon to drive the point.

134
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,026
Simon Doyle.

135
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,778
We're desperate to be married
as soon as possible.

136
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,321
That's why I wanted to see you.

137
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,989
You're not...

138
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,325
What? No, no.

139
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,410
- But we have sex a lot.
- Shh...

140
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,495
- Constantly.
- Jackie!

141
00:12:26,578 --> 00:12:27,746
Sorry, it's true.

142
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,832
Honestly, I'll die
if I can't be Mrs. Doyle.

143
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,417
It's love.

144
00:12:32,584 --> 00:12:34,211
On, if it's money you need,

145
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,587
call it a wedding gift.

146
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,924
No. Not money. A job.

147
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:40,926
You bought that new estate.

148
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,553
You'll need someone
to fix it up for you and run it.

149
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:45,764
You could give the job to Simon.

150
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,724
He's unemployed.
But he's country through and through.

151
00:12:47,891 --> 00:12:49,851
And he knows all about estates, I swear.

152
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:52,437
If he doesn't make good,
axe him on the spot.

153
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:54,898
But he will.
He's too spectacular to fail.

154
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,316
Oh, darling.

155
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:00,112
You got it so bad.
Be careful.

156
00:13:00,278 --> 00:13:01,279
It's too late.

157
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:02,614
Jackie, darling.

158
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,241
Here he is.

159
00:13:09,496 --> 00:13:11,623
Mm, that was naughty of me.

160
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,001
Hello.

161
00:13:14,918 --> 00:13:17,004
I hope you don't mind, I took the liberty.

162
00:13:17,587 --> 00:13:21,925
Simon, darling, meet the golden girl.
As advertised.

163
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,886
The divine Linnet Ridge way.

164
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,141
Pleased to meet my new land agent.

165
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:31,351
Do you really mean that?

166
00:13:35,522 --> 00:13:38,025
Of course she does.

167
00:13:38,191 --> 00:13:39,860
Take her to the dance floor, silly.

168
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,570
Go and thank her properly.

169
00:13:59,921 --> 00:14:04,593
<i>Now won't you hear me singing</i>

170
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,096
<i>Hear the words that I'm saying</i>

171
00:14:08,638 --> 00:14:13,351
<i>Wash my soul with water from on high</i>

172
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,814
<i>While the world of love</i>

173
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,067
<i>Is around me</i>

174
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:24,196
<i>Evil thoughts do bind me</i>

175
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:27,574
<i>But, oh, if you leave me</i>

176
00:14:27,949 --> 00:14:30,243
<i>I will die</i>

177
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:36,208
<i>You had me in thou bosom</i>

178
00:14:36,374 --> 00:14:40,754
<i>Till the storms of life is over</i>

179
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,839
<i>Rock me</i>

180
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:46,468
<i>In a cradle of thou love</i>

181
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,639
<i>Only feed</i>

182
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,272
<i>Then you take me</i>

183
00:14:59,439 --> 00:15:03,443
<i>To your blessed home above</i>

184
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:17,916
Let's hear it one more time
for Salome Otterbourne.

185
00:16:27,402 --> 00:16:28,528
Monsieur?

186
00:16:31,239 --> 00:16:33,325
<i>Monsieur, alors! Monsieur!</i>

187
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,454
You are defiling
one of the Wonders of the World!

188
00:16:37,954 --> 00:16:40,373
And also, by the way,
ruining a sublime Jaffa cake!

189
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,708
Monsieur!

190
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:50,217
You beautiful kite!

191
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:01,853
What? Poirot!

192
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,063
Bouc!

193
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,190
What are you doing here?

194
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:08,151
What do you think
about my kite?

195
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:11,112
I'll come down. Stay there.

196
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,197
Be careful.

197
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:15,242
Of all the pyramids
in all the world,

198
00:17:15,408 --> 00:17:18,578
you had to walk up to mine.

199
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,247
What a small world.

200
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,333
<i>Mon ami, Bouc!</i>

201
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:26,127
Why would you fly a kite on the pyramids?

202
00:17:26,294 --> 00:17:27,462
Because no one ever has!

203
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,048
Thousands of years,
right here, and I'm the first!

204
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:31,424
You are the first.

205
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:34,469
Poirot, it is good to see you.

206
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,888
Are you on an exotic holiday
or an exotic case?

207
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,140
Cases, I am in hiding from cases.

208
00:17:39,307 --> 00:17:41,643
Well, if you want to hide,
come and hide with us.

209
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,937
In Assouan. We're on a whirlwind tour.

210
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,314
Still the constant traveler.

211
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,857
Mm. Sadly, no.

212
00:17:48,024 --> 00:17:50,944
Uncle sacked me off the train
once he found out that I did nothing.

213
00:17:51,111 --> 00:17:52,862
I tried jobs. An office.

214
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:55,532
I could manage the work,
I just couldn't fathom mornings.

215
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,701
But I've made ends meet as a kept man.

216
00:17:57,867 --> 00:17:59,494
Come!

217
00:17:59,577 --> 00:18:01,329
Come. I shall introduce you to Euphemia.

218
00:18:01,496 --> 00:18:02,497
But who is Euphemia?

219
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:03,748
Well, you'll find out.

220
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,667
A new young lady
in the life of Bouc?

221
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,751
A new name to me.

222
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,671
Well, behind every kite-flying man,
there is a woman.

223
00:18:14,342 --> 00:18:15,385
Here she is.

224
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,346
The only woman I have ever loved...
Mother.

225
00:18:18,513 --> 00:18:20,432
Mother, you must meet Hercule Poirot.

226
00:18:20,598 --> 00:18:23,143
- Why?
- He's only the greatest detective alive.

227
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,562
Oh, he exaggerates.

228
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,105
No, he is quite correct, actually.

229
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,025
You are quite the most ludicrous man
I have ever seen.

230
00:18:30,108 --> 00:18:31,234
Not the first time I've heard this.

231
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,194
- And you're in my view.
- Stepping aside.

232
00:18:33,361 --> 00:18:37,198
Be kind, Mother.
Poirot here is my friend, and he's famous.

233
00:18:37,365 --> 00:18:38,533
And he's joining our dinner tonight.

234
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,452
- Is he?
- I cannot intrude.

235
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:42,746
Oh, no, not at all.
You bump my stock at the table.

236
00:18:42,912 --> 00:18:45,457
It's not just Mother and I on holiday,
we're celebrating with friends.

237
00:18:45,623 --> 00:18:47,417
It's a wedding party.

238
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,003
Ooh. Is that me?

239
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,255
Might be.

240
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,548
Be nice.

241
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,052
Excuse me.

242
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:33,046
"Should have
entire situation managed,

243
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:36,299
"then back to business as usual."

244
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,761
Do you have all of that?
Good.

245
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:43,556
Now, please see this telegram
sent off as soon as able.

246
00:19:44,182 --> 00:19:48,144
And not another soul sees it.

247
00:19:50,188 --> 00:19:51,731
No! I'll do it!

248
00:19:51,898 --> 00:19:56,111
It's bad enough we have to stay
in this bourgeois nightmare of a hotel,

249
00:19:56,653 --> 00:20:01,074
but I won't be party
to the oppression of the working class.

250
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:05,453
Unless it's me, of course.
Then she's perfectly fine with it.

251
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:08,164
I am calm, capable, and coping.

252
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:13,962
Dignity.

253
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:20,802
Marie Van Schuyler.
And I don't need a suite.

254
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,804
It's just me
and my nurse Bowers.

255
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:24,806
I'm Mrs. Doyle's godmother.

256
00:20:24,889 --> 00:20:26,641
We do have reservations.

257
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:29,102
And will this area be cleared
for the party?

258
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:32,856
We don't want just anybody hanging around
and stealing the champagne.

259
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,360
Is it very expensive?

260
00:20:38,778 --> 00:20:40,029
<i>Merci.</i>

261
00:20:54,961 --> 00:20:55,962
Ladies and gentlemen,

262
00:20:56,045 --> 00:20:58,089
we are closing this reception
area for a wedding party.

263
00:20:58,256 --> 00:20:59,757
Everything fine, madame?

264
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:01,426
It's perfect.

265
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,640
The cost of this party
could feed a village for a year.

266
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:08,808
It's an obscene extravagance.

267
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:11,102
I know. Wonderful, isn't it?

268
00:21:11,269 --> 00:21:15,607
Is it true you donated your entire fortune
to the Socialist Party, dear?

269
00:21:15,773 --> 00:21:16,816
Communist.

270
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:20,737
"Money is the alienated essence
of man's labor and life."

271
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,281
Money is the only friend
a woman can rely on.

272
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:24,741
Look at this!

273
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:27,452
Ladies and gentlemen. And Mother.

274
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:30,622
It is my honor to introduce our hosts.

275
00:21:30,788 --> 00:21:32,081
Please welcome the newlyweds,

276
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,793
Mr. and Mrs. Simon Doyle!

277
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,880
There they are!

278
00:21:41,674 --> 00:21:43,551
<i>Magnifique, madame!</i>

279
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:47,138
- Fantastic, Linny!
- Beautiful!

280
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,476
Ah, love.

281
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,270
It is not safe.

282
00:21:55,396 --> 00:21:57,774
I bore witness to a small drama
some weeks ago.

283
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:00,109
Clearly, I caught only the first act.

284
00:22:00,276 --> 00:22:02,070
Like an angel, Linny!

285
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:03,655
Lucky devil.

286
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:06,908
Fancy finding the one heiress
without adenoids and flat feet.

287
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,493
Eloped as fast as they could.

288
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,786
Convention be damned.

289
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,996
Married for love
and got money by chance,

290
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,331
that's the lightning strike.

291
00:22:13,414 --> 00:22:15,166
Three cheers and a tiger from me!

292
00:22:16,334 --> 00:22:17,377
How do I look?

293
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,254
Like a million dollars.

294
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,505
Mm, make that two million.

295
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,549
Oh, my wedding gift from Simon.

296
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,884
Yes, paid for
with her account, so, hardly.

297
00:22:25,051 --> 00:22:26,636
Her gift to her via me.

298
00:22:29,347 --> 00:22:33,309
I was sure Bouc was fibbing
when he said he knew the Hercule Poirot.

299
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:34,894
<i>Enchantée, monsieur.</i>

300
00:22:35,061 --> 00:22:37,105
My congratulations
and my gratitude, madame.

301
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:39,566
<i>Merci.</i> Ladies. Godmother.

302
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:42,610
Cousin Andrew!

303
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,738
Simon.

304
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:49,033
Cousin Andrew, my trustee
for all Ridge way affairs,

305
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,118
abroad and domestic.

306
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,036
He's practically family.

307
00:22:52,203 --> 00:22:55,123
I made him come
so he'd take a vacation for once.

308
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:58,126
I'm only here for the champagne,
sacred honor.

309
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,920
And for this...

310
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,549
Oh.

311
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,843
Oh, that's so sweet!

312
00:23:09,345 --> 00:23:10,763
Isn't it adorable?

313
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:16,311
Friends, I know you're all thinking
there is a mystery at play here.

314
00:23:16,477 --> 00:23:21,399
The case of "Why in the hell
would Linnet Ridge way marry him?"

315
00:23:21,482 --> 00:23:23,401
And I honestly can't say why.

316
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:26,404
I'm not smart or romantic.

317
00:23:26,946 --> 00:23:30,116
I don't have the words, or the money,
or the pedigree.

318
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,160
But I do love you.

319
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,996
And now...

320
00:23:36,247 --> 00:23:40,668
Well, I don't even want to say it,
lest the thieves come and steal you away.

321
00:23:41,377 --> 00:23:42,378
To the bride and groom.

322
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,297
Bride and groom.

323
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,677
- Three cheers!
- Three cheers!

324
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:52,639
Salome Otterbourne
sang the night we met.

325
00:23:52,805 --> 00:23:54,766
So, I begged your old pal, Rosalie,

326
00:23:55,141 --> 00:23:57,352
to beg her to travel with us.

327
00:23:57,518 --> 00:23:58,728
I wouldn't have missed it.

328
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,522
I haven't tasted caviar
in 10 years.

329
00:24:01,689 --> 00:24:03,775
What a decadent display of wealth.

330
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,153
Come on, Linny, let's dance.

331
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,198
Ah, the bereaved.

332
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,741
There's one at every wedding party.

333
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,826
The good Doctor Windlesham proposed
to Miss Ridge way

334
00:24:13,993 --> 00:24:15,703
when she was still Miss Ridge way.

335
00:24:15,870 --> 00:24:18,373
He and the papers
both had the deal as good as done.

336
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:22,335
Then came the engorged stallion,
and now it's Mrs. Doyle.

337
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:26,005
If I were in his shoes, I'd only come here
to put a bullet in the groom.

338
00:24:26,172 --> 00:24:30,426
Our other guests, Linnet's godmother,
who despises Linnet's wealth,

339
00:24:30,593 --> 00:24:32,970
and the godmother's nursemaid,
Bowers, who covets it,

340
00:24:33,137 --> 00:24:34,806
as does Linnet's own maid,

341
00:24:34,889 --> 00:24:36,057
poor old Louise.

342
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,935
Oh, and there's Cousin Andrew.
He's a slippery fish.

343
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,770
No one except Linnet trusts him.

344
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,898
We find Mother and I
are the only sane people here.

345
00:24:45,316 --> 00:24:47,402
The only one who seems
to like Linnet at all

346
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:48,945
is her old schoolmate, Rosalie.

347
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,239
And she's Salome Otterbourne's niece

348
00:24:51,322 --> 00:24:52,990
and arranged for her
to come to play for them.

349
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,283
Monsieur Poirot,
come and dance.

350
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:55,368
Oh. Good luck.

351
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,203
<i>Rock me</i>

352
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:00,415
<i>In a cradle of thou love</i>

353
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,917
- Looking good, Simon!
- Come, everyone! Let's go!

354
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,001
Come on.

355
00:25:04,168 --> 00:25:08,506
<i>Only feed me</i>

356
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:11,259
<i>Till I want no more</i>

357
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,302
<i>Then you take me</i>

358
00:25:13,469 --> 00:25:17,348
<i>To your blessed home above</i>

359
00:25:38,244 --> 00:25:39,996
She's followed us again.

360
00:25:42,331 --> 00:25:43,791
I'm sorry.

361
00:25:52,091 --> 00:25:54,427
Alas, Act Three.

362
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,888
Turns out there's two bereaved
at every party.

363
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,729
How's Linnet?

364
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,726
No, no. Thank you very much.
Thank you. Yeah, very nice.

365
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,478
Try a piece.

366
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:55,947
Oh, very nice.

367
00:26:57,114 --> 00:26:58,324
Oh, look at those boxes in there.

368
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,492
- He's here.
- Who is?

369
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:00,743
Poirot.

370
00:27:01,118 --> 00:27:02,286
Well, then let's speak to him.

371
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,497
Excuse me. Excuse me.

372
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:05,998
The snake is your friend, eh?

373
00:27:06,165 --> 00:27:08,084
My best friend.

374
00:27:08,167 --> 00:27:09,377
Monsieur Poirot.

375
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,295
Sorry about the high drama last night.

376
00:27:11,462 --> 00:27:13,089
Do think about giving us
another go tonight.

377
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:14,757
You are much too kind to strangers.

378
00:27:16,467 --> 00:27:17,927
Careful! Careful!

379
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,471
Thank you.

380
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,764
- Madame.
- So sorry!

381
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:22,932
I go. I go.

382
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:24,976
You all right?

383
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,937
Mr. and Mrs. Doyle, I'm so sorry.

384
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,398
Actually, Poirot,
we wanted to ask for your help.

385
00:27:31,065 --> 00:27:32,692
It's, uh, Jackie de Bellefort.

386
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:35,069
She's followed us
every step of our honeymoon.

387
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,532
She and I...
We were engaged, you see.

388
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:43,536
Has she made any specific threats?

389
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,707
No, she doesn't say a thing.
She only shows up, and sits, and stares.

390
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,875
<i>Pardonnez-moi, non.</i>

391
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:51,669
There is no case for me to accept.
She has committed no crime.

392
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:56,716
It's indecent, what she's doing.
And melodramatic.

393
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,343
And she's making an ass of herself
is what it is.

394
00:28:00,511 --> 00:28:03,306
See, when I was with Jackie,
I liked her, I did.

395
00:28:03,931 --> 00:28:07,852
Then I met Linnet.
Jackie just didn't exist for me anymore.

396
00:28:09,353 --> 00:28:13,649
From "Hello," I just couldn't imagine
any other path but by her side.

397
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:15,651
And lucky me, she felt the same.

398
00:28:16,944 --> 00:28:18,195
I could've punched the sun.

399
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,823
Hmm. Instead, you broke your engagement.

400
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,578
Does he have to spend the rest of his life
with someone he doesn't love

401
00:28:25,661 --> 00:28:27,371
to spare her feelings?

402
00:28:27,663 --> 00:28:29,665
It's love.

403
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,960
It's not a game played fair.
There are no rules.

404
00:28:34,253 --> 00:28:36,547
Now, maybe she hasn't
committed a crime yet.

405
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:38,841
But I know Jackie, she will.

406
00:28:39,675 --> 00:28:41,719
She always settled her scores.

407
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:46,098
Do think about it.

408
00:29:02,156 --> 00:29:03,282
Mademoiselle.

409
00:29:03,449 --> 00:29:04,450
Do I know you?

410
00:29:04,533 --> 00:29:07,578
If you will permit me
a little moment to talk with you?

411
00:29:09,121 --> 00:29:10,247
Of course.

412
00:29:10,748 --> 00:29:12,124
Here it comes.

413
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:16,128
Linnet paid a detective a bucket of money
to knock me off her tail.

414
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:18,589
She kindly offered, I politely declined.

415
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,549
Boo-hoo.

416
00:29:20,716 --> 00:29:22,218
Madame is used to getting what she wants.

417
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:24,887
Her father was halfway to a gangster.

418
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,681
You have known Madame Doyle for some time?

419
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,767
We met doing the school play.

420
00:29:31,018 --> 00:29:32,853
<i>Antony and Cleopatra.</i>

421
00:29:34,897 --> 00:29:35,982
I was Cleopatra,

422
00:29:36,148 --> 00:29:37,733
until the teacher came
a week before opening

423
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,694
and decided to give my part to Linnet.

424
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,238
I was stuck with Charmian, the handmaid.

425
00:29:42,738 --> 00:29:45,449
You have our newlyweds in the twist.

426
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:50,413
First, I did it just to be near him.

427
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:54,500
Then I got bold, and let them see me.

428
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,752
I saw her smile fade

429
00:29:57,294 --> 00:29:58,879
and lines crack across her forehead.

430
00:29:59,046 --> 00:30:01,173
Mademoiselle de Bellefort,
you must give this up.

431
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:04,802
What is done is done.
Bitterness will not undo it.

432
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,971
He is married.
He is in love with his wife.

433
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:08,514
Simon loves me.

434
00:30:09,807 --> 00:30:11,058
Simon loves me.

435
00:30:11,809 --> 00:30:12,810
I know it.

436
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,439
Even if he's forgotten, dazzled by her.

437
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,900
Love that fierce doesn't vanish.

438
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,821
I love him.

439
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,658
I love him madly,
badly, at every minute.

440
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,578
It's not something
I can switch off.

441
00:30:35,666 --> 00:30:38,586
There's a reason the heart is the organ
given to love, you know.

442
00:30:40,796 --> 00:30:43,007
If it stops to rest, we die.

443
00:30:45,426 --> 00:30:47,094
And I won't die alone,

444
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,972
you can be sure of that.

445
00:30:53,517 --> 00:30:55,644
It's a .22 caliber.

446
00:30:59,815 --> 00:31:01,650
It's practically a toy.

447
00:31:03,277 --> 00:31:05,905
Maybe, to fix a broken heart,

448
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:08,491
all it takes is a single bullet.

449
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,081
Damn her.

450
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,000
All right. What would you have us do?
Try the police?

451
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:20,377
Well, if I may humbly advise?

452
00:31:21,295 --> 00:31:23,631
I am sure Mrs. Doyle has a fine home.

453
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,633
Go to it now.

454
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,136
Build your nest,
begin your lives together.

455
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,264
We could, Simon.

456
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:35,184
We could go home and shut the gates.

457
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,520
We could be happy.

458
00:31:38,062 --> 00:31:39,647
What, just pack it in?

459
00:31:40,147 --> 00:31:41,649
But what about our honeymoon?

460
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:44,610
Consider it the cost of love.

461
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,280
And a bargain at that, huh?

462
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,533
<i>Bonne nuit.</i>

463
00:31:50,699 --> 00:31:51,951
<i>Merci.</i>

464
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:10,928
This way. Don't dawdle.

465
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,763
- What's the scam here, Simon?
- Hurry on.

466
00:32:12,930 --> 00:32:14,473
I thought we were sightseeing today?

467
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,518
Yes, I know I invited you
for another 10 days

468
00:32:17,601 --> 00:32:19,019
sightseeing in Assouan to Philae,

469
00:32:19,186 --> 00:32:22,064
but circumstances invited inspiration.

470
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:25,067
So, like Moses, not far from here,

471
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:27,945
we have made a surprise turn at the water.

472
00:32:28,445 --> 00:32:31,282
- After all, I couldn't refuse...
- What?

473
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,368
...the Queen of the Nile.

474
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:53,762
"I have immortal longings in me."

475
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:55,431
Bravo!

476
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:03,189
It is gorgeous!

477
00:33:03,355 --> 00:33:05,191
Mother, why don't
we have a boat like that?

478
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:07,776
You got too much money, Linnet.
Not enough sense.

479
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,737
But great taste in boats!

480
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:14,783
See?

481
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,911
I told you it'd all be fine.

482
00:33:17,369 --> 00:33:20,706
Jackie won't be able to follow us anymore.

483
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:22,791
Let's go.

484
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,919
All right, everybody aboard!

485
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,794
Permission to come aboard.

486
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:20,015
Oh, wow! It's beautiful.

487
00:34:20,182 --> 00:34:22,268
You look so happy.
You deserve it.

488
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:36,323
We have the <i>Karnak</i> all to ourselves
until Abu Simbel.

489
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:39,535
Don't worry about your things,
darling Louise will go back

490
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,746
and pack up all your rooms for you
and meet us at Shellal.

491
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:43,831
Happy to, miss.

492
00:34:43,914 --> 00:34:45,165
Thank you.

493
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,875
We have a piano tuned,

494
00:34:47,042 --> 00:34:49,586
a chef stolen from Shepheard's of Cairo,

495
00:34:49,753 --> 00:34:53,090
and enough champagne to fill the Nile.

496
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,303
Champagne!

497
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:58,971
It's not even half ten.

498
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,223
Then we're behind.

499
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,975
So, there is one more above, yes?

500
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,060
Hello, Egypt.

501
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,340
All luggage from the hotel
is going to the <i>Karnak.</i>

502
00:35:34,506 --> 00:35:35,507
Monsieur Doyle.

503
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,635
I need Monsieur Doyle.
I need those three trunks there. <i>Oui.</i>

504
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:46,060
I shall strike this like Joe DiMaggio.

505
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:49,730
- Oh, completely useless.
- Five, Officer.

506
00:35:49,813 --> 00:35:51,690
- Make that a naught.
- Five points.

507
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:52,983
Bowers, my love.

508
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,818
I'm winning by quite a margin.

509
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,946
Well done.

510
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:59,948
Well,
that's the borderline, surely.

511
00:36:00,032 --> 00:36:01,450
- Huh?
- What's that, there?

512
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,328
I'd say that's a grebe, isn't it?
Very beautiful.

513
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:33,148
- You just moved my puck.
- Foul shot.

514
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:36,068
Bouc, that was a foul shot
and you know it. Take it again.

515
00:36:36,151 --> 00:36:37,736
You're a cheat. A swindler.

516
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:39,822
Linnet, you've got cheats on board.

517
00:36:39,988 --> 00:36:42,783
Bowers and Van Schuyler are cheats,
just like these two.

518
00:36:45,577 --> 00:36:47,246
<i>Katherine, mon amour.</i>

519
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,458
Monsieur Poirot,

520
00:36:51,625 --> 00:36:53,919
I hope you can forgive
my hijacking your holiday.

521
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:57,506
Couldn't let you miss the fun.

522
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,758
It is an honor.

523
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,302
And it is convenient to my own plans.

524
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:05,139
Although, travel by water
does not naturally agree with me.

525
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:06,306
Oh, I could tell you...

526
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,933
Well, I should not tell you, actually.

527
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,686
But I suspect you perhaps may have

528
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:13,063
included me for reasons
other than the fun.

529
00:37:19,027 --> 00:37:20,946
I wish we'd gone home like you said.

530
00:37:21,363 --> 00:37:23,699
- Ah.
- I don't feel safe here.

531
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:27,077
Not me, not Simon, even with Jackie gone.

532
00:37:27,244 --> 00:37:28,871
But you are among friends.

533
00:37:29,037 --> 00:37:30,539
When you have money,

534
00:37:31,498 --> 00:37:33,459
no one is ever really your friend.

535
00:37:34,334 --> 00:37:39,673
Now I'm remembering
old jealousies and fights.

536
00:37:40,799 --> 00:37:42,926
It takes a pill to get to sleep.

537
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:49,266
I don't feel safe with any of them.

538
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,317
I hoped you might watch for us.

539
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,116
Hmm.

540
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,284
Thank you.

541
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:33,310
Mm... Now?

542
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:34,561
And now.

543
00:38:35,687 --> 00:38:37,773
See? Completely normal.

544
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,483
I'm so hot.

545
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,443
Yes, you're in Egypt.

546
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,528
It's malaria.

547
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:43,737
You don't have malaria.

548
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,073
You know I have a temperature.
That thermometer is broken.

549
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:47,324
It's perfectly normal.

550
00:38:47,407 --> 00:38:49,409
- No, no, it's broken.
- No, it's not broken.

551
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,203
- Oh, I'm so hot.
- It's how it should be.

552
00:38:52,829 --> 00:38:53,997
I know, I know.

553
00:38:54,164 --> 00:38:57,167
Tactless to talk business
to a bride on her honeymoon.

554
00:38:57,334 --> 00:38:59,586
Bad lawyer. You promised.

555
00:38:59,753 --> 00:39:01,838
There's only a few quick signatures.

556
00:39:02,005 --> 00:39:04,758
Fair enough. My marriage has
made a difference, I'm sure.

557
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:07,469
Do give us more notice next time.

558
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,434
It... It's all quite straightforward.

559
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,520
The Ceylon land concession

560
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,772
and the obvious changes to the new will.

561
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,776
The lease of the London property.

562
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,947
It's all quite straightforward.

563
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:29,783
I'm sorry, cousin, you know me.

564
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:33,328
Never met a contract
I couldn't find some corrections.

565
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,289
Papa taught me too well.

566
00:39:35,455 --> 00:39:37,374
Not me. That's not my way.

567
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,501
I've never read a contract in my life.

568
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:41,336
Any deal that can't be made
with a handshake

569
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,629
just isn't for me.

570
00:39:43,338 --> 00:39:45,257
Go on, Linny. Sign it.

571
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,050
Sooner you do,
the sooner we can get to bed.

572
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:52,180
You were the first girl who ever told me

573
00:39:52,347 --> 00:39:55,809
that a woman can run her affairs
as well as a man or better.

574
00:39:56,476 --> 00:39:59,271
Don't tell me that score changed
with one little husband.

575
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:05,902
Go get ready for the party, Simon.

576
00:40:06,069 --> 00:40:07,946
I promise I won't be too long.

577
00:40:08,113 --> 00:40:09,656
I'm being rude.

578
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,576
It's no rush.

579
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,411
Just kick it to tomorrow.

580
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,543
<i>Up above my head</i>

581
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:23,003
<i>Up above my head</i>

582
00:40:23,086 --> 00:40:25,714
<i>- I hear music in the air
- I hear music in the air</i>

583
00:40:25,797 --> 00:40:28,508
<i>- Now up above my head
- Up above my head</i>

584
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:31,720
<i>- You know I hear music in the air
- I hear music in the air</i>

585
00:40:31,803 --> 00:40:33,096
<i>Up above my head</i>

586
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:34,181
<i>Up above my head</i>

587
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:37,351
<i>- I hear music in the air
- I hear music in the air</i>

588
00:40:37,434 --> 00:40:40,145
<i>- And I really do believe
- Yes, I really do believe</i>

589
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:41,563
<i>There's a heaven somewhere</i>

590
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,648
<i>Heaven somewhere</i>

591
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,566
<i>Up above my head</i>

592
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,360
- <i>Up above my head</i>
- Come down, Poirot.

593
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,071
<i>I see trouble in the air</i>

594
00:40:49,237 --> 00:40:51,907
<i>And I really do believe
That there's a heaven somewhere</i>

595
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,743
<i>Heaven somewhere</i>

596
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,997
Bloody good fun!

597
00:40:59,581 --> 00:41:01,667
<i>Bravissimo!</i>

598
00:41:02,459 --> 00:41:03,877
Wonderful, as ever.

599
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:05,170
Thank you.

600
00:41:08,465 --> 00:41:10,467
Madame, I am so moved.

601
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,594
Your bluesy music
has joy on top for the dancing,

602
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,554
yet there is tragedy in there, too.

603
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:16,890
Writing tragedy is easy.

604
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,810
I just imagine someone I wanna punish.

605
00:41:19,976 --> 00:41:22,187
Then I imagine them in love.

606
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:28,735
You've, uh,

607
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,072
taken quite a keen interest
in Salome Otterbourne.

608
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,659
I thought Poirot was impervious
to love's fever.

609
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,286
I was sick with it once.

610
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:42,165
It left me with enough regret
for a lifetime.

611
00:41:44,751 --> 00:41:46,294
There are many fine detectives.

612
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,797
Well, that is not true.
There are many average detectives.

613
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:50,716
But to be what I am,

614
00:41:50,882 --> 00:41:53,093
it requires fixedness of mind.

615
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,138
The little grey cells pampered, indulged,

616
00:41:56,304 --> 00:41:58,265
given all the oxygen in my blood,

617
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:00,767
and minutes on my clock.

618
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:04,563
No, I leave the tempest of love to you.

619
00:42:05,605 --> 00:42:07,023
But what of the niece?

620
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,818
A beguiling lady, no?

621
00:42:09,901 --> 00:42:11,069
Is she?

622
00:42:11,236 --> 00:42:13,780
A cool, methodical brain
of the highest order.

623
00:42:13,947 --> 00:42:15,657
She sings well, too.

624
00:42:15,949 --> 00:42:17,659
- Hmm?
- I hadn't noticed.

625
00:42:17,743 --> 00:42:20,787
She's, um, a schoolmate
of Linnet's, I hear?

626
00:42:20,954 --> 00:42:22,748
You are trying to keep secrets from me?

627
00:42:22,914 --> 00:42:24,708
- From me? From me?
- What?

628
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,878
Rosalie Otterbourne
is an overtly beautiful woman,

629
00:42:28,044 --> 00:42:31,256
and Bouc has not spoken to her once?

630
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:36,011
It's nothing short of gobsmacked love!

631
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,220
Look, I've been bursting to tell you.

632
00:42:37,387 --> 00:42:38,764
Linnet introduced us months ago

633
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:41,475
and since then, there hasn't been
another woman I've wanted to look at

634
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:43,935
except as a...
a nanny to our children.

635
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:47,147
She is the cleverest, most shocking,

636
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,191
most alive woman I've ever met.

637
00:42:49,357 --> 00:42:51,526
I'm outclassed in a breath
and she loves me anyway.

638
00:42:51,693 --> 00:42:53,695
I mean, it's the only
bad mark against her.

639
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:56,198
<i>Mon ami, Bouc, amoureux,</i>

640
00:42:56,364 --> 00:42:58,033
shouting from the rooftops, huh?

641
00:42:58,116 --> 00:43:01,244
Well, no,
not where Mother can hear.

642
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:05,040
Madame Bouc does not support
the match, huh?

643
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:07,959
She's never cared
for anyone I've ever brought home,

644
00:43:08,126 --> 00:43:11,004
unless it was clear
that they were only staying the night.

645
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,215
Being American doesn't help either.

646
00:43:13,298 --> 00:43:16,468
Mother doesn't approve of people
being born outside Mayfair.

647
00:43:16,635 --> 00:43:18,512
She's furious at Linnet
for making us a pair.

648
00:43:18,678 --> 00:43:20,263
And her opinion, does it matter?

649
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,556
Money matters,

650
00:43:21,723 --> 00:43:24,226
and mine comes monthly from Euphemia Bouc.

651
00:43:24,392 --> 00:43:25,644
I've tried to earn enough

652
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:27,521
so that I don't need
her permission to marry,

653
00:43:27,604 --> 00:43:29,189
only her blessing,

654
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:30,482
but I'm just rotten at it.

655
00:43:32,108 --> 00:43:33,401
All my life,

656
00:43:33,568 --> 00:43:36,822
I never wanted to be anything to anyone
but an amusement.

657
00:43:36,988 --> 00:43:38,490
But for Rosalie, I...

658
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,826
I want to be good.

659
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,672
Come along.
Ship's crew ready for departure.

660
00:43:53,755 --> 00:43:54,840
Returning 5:00 a.m.

661
00:43:55,006 --> 00:43:57,676
And remember, we have new guests
arriving at Abu Simbel.

662
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:58,927
- Good night.
- Good night.

663
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,417
We are nearly there.

664
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:36,047
Ladies and gentlemen,

665
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,841
we are approaching Abu Simbel.

666
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,495
We're all going.

667
00:45:07,662 --> 00:45:10,123
No stragglers.
You, too, Louise, you're with us.

668
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,333
I have the pressing to do.

669
00:45:11,499 --> 00:45:13,043
We're in ancient Egypt.

670
00:45:13,209 --> 00:45:14,753
It was your idea for a honeymoon

671
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:16,504
when you were engaged.

672
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,423
<i>- Coffee,</i> Mrs. Doyle?
- Thank you, Claire.

673
00:45:20,842 --> 00:45:21,843
What's that?

674
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,595
The sandstorm is miles away, madame.

675
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,680
No need to worry.

676
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:29,100
I can't find my tube of carmine red.

677
00:45:29,267 --> 00:45:32,312
I can't be expected to capture
these horizons without red.

678
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:35,106
Brushes down, Mother.
It's the temple of Abu Simbel.

679
00:45:35,273 --> 00:45:37,609
Ramesses the Great awaits.

680
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,617
Ramesses II,

681
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:49,496
married to Nefertari,
first and favorite of his eight wives.

682
00:45:49,704 --> 00:45:52,165
On the walls
of the queen's burial <i>mastaba,</i>

683
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:53,708
he wrote a poem to her,
which is spectacular...

684
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,335
- Oh, sir, may I see?
- Oh, yes.

685
00:45:56,127 --> 00:45:58,171
"My love is like no other.

686
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:01,049
"Just by passing, she has stolen my heart.

687
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,927
"She is the one for whom the sun shines."

688
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,012
He is a man in love.

689
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:09,557
He murdered half of Nubia.
Great useless blocks of masonry

690
00:46:09,724 --> 00:46:13,895
put up to minister to the egoism
of a despotic bloated king.

691
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:16,564
Mm, I really like their hats.

692
00:46:16,731 --> 00:46:17,983
Fascinating story.

693
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:27,492
It's bad enough
to be married for one lifetime.

694
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:31,204
To be side by side for eternity
is inhumane.

695
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:33,581
Why must you be
so cynical, Mother?

696
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:36,835
People build towers
to love in song and stone

697
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,922
as if cooing over a pair of dark eyes
will save them from pain.

698
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,008
If anything, it will double it.

699
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:44,759
It's over there? Thank you.

700
00:46:46,594 --> 00:46:47,595
Go on.

701
00:46:47,887 --> 00:46:51,182
Think you and that beautiful girl
will be the exception?

702
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,893
Not every love turns to misery.

703
00:46:54,060 --> 00:46:57,147
No, the lucky ones die in childbirth.

704
00:46:57,897 --> 00:46:59,858
It's my job to protect you.

705
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,318
You think I don't know what you're after?

706
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:06,531
You... You want my blessing
to marry that girl.

707
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,158
Well, you can't have it.

708
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,918
Rosalie!

709
00:47:20,545 --> 00:47:22,005
Everything all right?

710
00:47:22,088 --> 00:47:23,089
Yes.

711
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,467
No more hiding.

712
00:47:25,842 --> 00:47:28,970
- We'll make it on our own.
- Yes.

713
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,555
Whoo!

714
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,476
New passenger coming aboard.

715
00:48:02,587 --> 00:48:04,089
I've got too much
sand in my shoes.

716
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,465
Here we are!
How's that?

717
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:09,928
You approve of them?

718
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,348
First man she ever brought home,

719
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,766
a wealthy lawyer.

720
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,226
Straight, narrow,

721
00:48:16,392 --> 00:48:18,812
on his way to being a Missouri Senator.

722
00:48:19,270 --> 00:48:21,231
Then, there was a baron
who owned islands,

723
00:48:21,314 --> 00:48:22,649
manners of a king.

724
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,443
Now, it's this penniless Bouc

725
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:28,113
who drinks too much,
and laughs too loud

726
00:48:28,279 --> 00:48:30,031
and always at the wrong thing.

727
00:48:31,407 --> 00:48:34,577
I like him best.

728
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,331
Do you have a husband, madame?

729
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,542
I've had a handful of husbands.

730
00:48:41,167 --> 00:48:42,460
Each one, a handful.

731
00:48:43,044 --> 00:48:44,379
Mm.

732
00:48:44,462 --> 00:48:46,047
Are you married, Mr. Poirot?

733
00:48:46,214 --> 00:48:47,382
I have not that felicity.

734
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:48,967
Which felicity do you have?

735
00:48:53,888 --> 00:48:55,431
I have my cases.

736
00:48:55,890 --> 00:48:57,767
- I have my books.
- Oh.

737
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:01,604
I, uh...

738
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:05,859
In fact, I have my eye
on a cottage where I hope, uh,

739
00:49:06,609 --> 00:49:09,237
eventually to retire...

740
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:11,072
and garden.

741
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:17,036
I hope to perfect a new

742
00:49:17,203 --> 00:49:19,706
strain of the vegetable marrows.

743
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,335
They are magnificent vegetables,

744
00:49:24,502 --> 00:49:25,837
but they lack a little bit of flavor
which is...

745
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:29,465
I would prefer more flavorsome vegetables.

746
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:35,305
Madame.

747
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:39,851
What are you really doing way out here,
Mr. Poirot?

748
00:49:42,353 --> 00:49:43,771
Madame.

749
00:49:47,066 --> 00:49:50,653
You do realize
we've barely held hands past Cairo.

750
00:49:51,529 --> 00:49:53,615
I haven't been myself.

751
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:56,075
Well, who shall you be, then?

752
00:49:58,328 --> 00:50:00,413
Cleopatra, of course.

753
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:05,168
Come with me.

754
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,377
Come on.

755
00:50:06,544 --> 00:50:08,463
The ruler of two kingdoms.

756
00:50:19,349 --> 00:50:22,060
What would Cleopatra say?

757
00:50:22,143 --> 00:50:24,270
"Oh, Charmian.

758
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,482
"Where think'st thou he is now?

759
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:30,526
"Stands he

760
00:50:31,027 --> 00:50:32,403
"or sits he?

761
00:50:33,821 --> 00:50:35,490
"Or does he walk?

762
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,618
"Or is he on his horse?

763
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,206
"Oh, happy horse,

764
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,708
"to bear the weight of Antony!"

765
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,337
"He is speaking now.

766
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:51,589
"Or murmuring..."

767
00:50:51,756 --> 00:50:53,091
Oh, my God.

768
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:02,225
"Where is my serpent of old Nile?"

769
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:09,315
Look out! Bouc!

770
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:24,831
Everybody inside quickly!

771
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:34,340
Bouc, inside!

772
00:51:35,216 --> 00:51:36,509
Get inside!

773
00:51:40,054 --> 00:51:42,682
There was a balcony above the cliff,
a worker's platform,

774
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,058
but no sign of anyone.

775
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,394
Do you think someone did that on purpose?

776
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:51,524
Let's get you safe, dove.

777
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:51,584
Small world.

778
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:54,712
The captain just swore

779
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,339
that Jackie got here
when we left for the temple.

780
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,507
It couldn't have been her.

781
00:52:57,673 --> 00:52:59,967
I know she tried to kill us.
I want her off the ship now.

782
00:53:00,134 --> 00:53:03,096
She already had a ticket to board here.
Bought ahead.

783
00:53:03,262 --> 00:53:04,430
There's nothing we can do.

784
00:53:04,597 --> 00:53:06,516
I don't care! She always does this!

785
00:53:06,682 --> 00:53:09,102
Just tell me what it costs
to get her away from me!

786
00:53:09,268 --> 00:53:10,311
Name a price!

787
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,563
I'll buy the whole damn boat if I have to.

788
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,774
I'll buy the whole damn country!

789
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,183
- Madame.
- Thank you.

790
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,852
Thank you.

791
00:53:51,018 --> 00:53:52,061
Louise.

792
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,314
Have you seen my scarf?
I swear I had it earlier.

793
00:53:55,481 --> 00:53:57,817
No. No, Miss Marie.
I'll be sure to look.

794
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,110
Okay. You...

795
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,279
You don't take your meals with us?

796
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:02,864
Miss Linnet prefers me not to.

797
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,782
Oh.

798
00:54:05,658 --> 00:54:07,285
Ah, I love that girl Linnet.

799
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,829
But when the revolution comes,
she'll be the first.

800
00:54:10,246 --> 00:54:12,623
Blindfold, last cigarette,
up against the wall.

801
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,708
Bang!

802
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,715
Some detective. My ledger?

803
00:54:20,882 --> 00:54:22,341
You've taken my book.

804
00:54:24,677 --> 00:54:27,555
<i>J'ai fait une erreur bête, pardonnez-moi.</i>

805
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,349
I confuse you with, uh,

806
00:54:30,516 --> 00:54:32,852
my <i>Edwin Drood</i> in the parlor.

807
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:34,979
- Oh.
- I can see by your penmanship,

808
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:37,106
you are Dickens' rival in precision.

809
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:38,399
Mm-hmm.

810
00:54:42,403 --> 00:54:43,738
Monsieur Poirot.

811
00:54:44,947 --> 00:54:45,948
I wanted you to know

812
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,159
you won't have to look out
for us any longer.

813
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:52,538
Jackie might not be able
to see reason,

814
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,623
but we can.

815
00:54:54,081 --> 00:54:55,249
We're going home.

816
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:57,627
We'll get a car to Khartoum
first thing in the morning.

817
00:54:57,793 --> 00:55:00,254
And then donkey to rail to ship
to Wode Hall,

818
00:55:00,421 --> 00:55:02,089
and then familiar beds forever.

819
00:55:02,256 --> 00:55:03,633
To hell with Jackie de Bellefort.

820
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:13,351
Oh, dear.

821
00:55:13,434 --> 00:55:15,520
One last cork, though. Why not?

822
00:55:15,686 --> 00:55:17,271
I do not normally take <i>l'alcool...</i>

823
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,858
...but for this...

824
00:55:21,025 --> 00:55:22,026
Dove.

825
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:23,986
Monsieur.

826
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:25,196
- Yes.
- Yes.

827
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:27,990
- To going home.
- To going home.

828
00:55:28,157 --> 00:55:29,200
Thank you.

829
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:48,511
You're not built for boats.

830
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,429
Or champagne.

831
00:55:59,897 --> 00:56:01,732
Did you know that the wives
of dead pharaohs

832
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:03,526
were buried alive with them?

833
00:56:04,318 --> 00:56:06,153
They must have been locked in screaming.

834
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:10,283
But I bet there was one who was willing

835
00:56:10,449 --> 00:56:12,118
and couldn't bear to be parted.

836
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:15,204
You're sorry to see me.

837
00:56:17,540 --> 00:56:19,584
Like it or not, I'm in his thoughts.

838
00:56:21,085 --> 00:56:22,378
Simon is afraid of me.

839
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:25,089
Mademoiselle, you have a choice still.

840
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:28,301
You can ruin his life or begin a new one.

841
00:56:28,467 --> 00:56:30,720
It may not be the life that you imagined,

842
00:56:30,886 --> 00:56:33,889
but perhaps it will be the life
that God intended.

843
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:37,435
Love is far too important to trust to God.

844
00:56:38,436 --> 00:56:41,230
From the moment I met Simon,
I knew one thing for absolute certain,

845
00:56:41,397 --> 00:56:43,774
I will die if we are parted.

846
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,110
I once felt as you do.

847
00:56:47,486 --> 00:56:49,155
I loved so much.

848
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,658
I thought that if I lost her,
I should die.

849
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:54,785
I lost her.

850
00:56:54,952 --> 00:56:56,579
To another man?

851
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,373
A mortar shell.

852
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:02,168
Visiting me in hospital.

853
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:05,004
I was to be discharged in a month,

854
00:57:05,171 --> 00:57:09,842
but I begged for her to come at Christmas,
to be together.

855
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:12,803
She came, but the train was...

856
00:57:22,938 --> 00:57:24,357
After Katherine,

857
00:57:25,524 --> 00:57:27,109
I became

858
00:57:28,527 --> 00:57:30,821
whatever it is I am now.

859
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,372
I was going to be a farmer.

860
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,715
Forgive me, the champagne...

861
00:57:50,966 --> 00:57:55,054
it loosens the, uh, memory
and the mouth.

862
00:57:56,889 --> 00:57:59,475
Ship's crew ready for departure.

863
00:58:09,318 --> 00:58:10,986
It's after 12:00.

864
00:58:11,153 --> 00:58:12,571
The crew's left the boat.

865
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,657
Well, I want another cocktail.

866
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:18,160
- I'm done with today.
- No, no.

867
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,537
Time for bed, my love.

868
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:20,830
Yes.

869
00:58:20,996 --> 00:58:23,749
I'll take a pill,
so don't worry about waking me.

870
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,672
You're not joining her, Simon?

871
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,924
Oh, we've already made love today.

872
00:58:32,758 --> 00:58:34,719
- Twice.
- Three times.

873
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,806
Sleep well, <i>la reine Linnet.</i>

874
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,189
Jackie, I wish you well.

875
00:58:47,356 --> 00:58:48,566
I do.

876
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,109
I'm not sorry for what we did,

877
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:53,529
but I'm so sorry
for what it did to you.

878
00:58:56,073 --> 00:58:57,783
I wish we could stay friends.

879
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,912
You were the only one
who never cared about the money.

880
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:08,335
Good night, Jacks.

881
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:36,113
This is the last time
that you'll see either of us.

882
00:59:38,115 --> 00:59:39,158
You can't disappear.

883
00:59:39,241 --> 00:59:40,993
- Let's call it a night, Jackie.
- Yeah.

884
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,330
Oh, no, stay for a bit.
She's working up for a scene.

885
00:59:44,955 --> 00:59:47,374
God, I feel so free

886
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,337
and so fat-headed
for not turning around sooner.

887
00:59:51,504 --> 00:59:53,714
You can't get rid of me that easily,
Simon.

888
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,175
We were bound.

889
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:58,803
Heart and body, I gave you all of me.

890
00:59:58,969 --> 01:00:01,430
A few months of good times? Hmm?

891
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:02,848
Were they even that good?

892
01:00:03,265 --> 01:00:06,936
I swear, looking at you now
makes all the fond memories go sour.

893
01:00:07,102 --> 01:00:09,522
It's like trying to remember a party
after you've been sick.

894
01:00:09,688 --> 01:00:10,940
Simon, don't be cruel.

895
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:13,818
I've run dry on sympathy.

896
01:00:13,984 --> 01:00:16,445
Did you really think this little stunt
of yours would bring me back to you?

897
01:00:17,112 --> 01:00:20,991
You're a fool if you thought
I could ever love you again.

898
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,993
I don't think I ever did.

899
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:24,662
Simon, that's enough.

900
01:00:26,997 --> 01:00:28,415
You don't mean that.

901
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,877
You don't.

902
01:00:37,925 --> 01:00:39,093
Say you don't mean it!

903
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,304
Simon?

904
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:43,639
Simon.

905
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:50,688
- Sorry.
- No, no, no.

906
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:54,817
Rosalie, take her to Bowers.

907
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,151
- Now.
- Simon.

908
01:00:57,278 --> 01:00:59,613
- Simon.
- No, no, no.

909
01:00:59,780 --> 01:01:00,906
I'll get the doctor.

910
01:01:01,073 --> 01:01:02,116
- Rosalie!
- Huh?

911
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,247
Bowers! Nurse Bowers!

912
01:01:08,622 --> 01:01:10,207
Simon.

913
01:01:10,749 --> 01:01:11,750
Bowers?

914
01:01:12,668 --> 01:01:15,337
- No, no. Hey, hey! It's all right.
- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry!

915
01:01:15,504 --> 01:01:16,672
I'm so sorry!

916
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,007
Dr. Windlesham!

917
01:01:21,677 --> 01:01:22,678
What's going on?

918
01:01:22,761 --> 01:01:25,389
It's Simon, in the parlor. It looks bad.

919
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:28,392
Rosalie, stay there.
I will find Nurse Bowers.

920
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:29,727
- Yes.
- Right.

921
01:01:32,813 --> 01:01:33,814
Bowers?

922
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,317
- Bowers!
- Bouc?

923
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,777
- What's going on out there?
- What's the matter?

924
01:01:38,944 --> 01:01:40,404
It's Jackie. Bring your bag.

925
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,072
What's happened? Huh?

926
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:43,824
- This way.
- I don't know.

927
01:01:44,658 --> 01:01:46,827
Jackie.

928
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:48,621
Come straight in here.

929
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:55,419
- All right?
- Yes, go!

930
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:58,005
She shot me!

931
01:01:58,213 --> 01:02:00,090
No, no, I can't.
I can't move my leg.

932
01:02:00,257 --> 01:02:01,550
Bouc, help me.

933
01:02:01,717 --> 01:02:02,968
- Help me move him.
- Right.

934
01:02:04,261 --> 01:02:05,262
With me.

935
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,430
- Get him up!
- All right.

936
01:02:07,264 --> 01:02:08,515
Al right.

937
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,725
I'll give you something to ease the pain.

938
01:02:09,808 --> 01:02:11,602
Are you sure you don't want
to make it hurt more, Doctor?

939
01:02:11,769 --> 01:02:13,103
Settle the score.

940
01:02:13,270 --> 01:02:15,940
The bone's shattered.
We need a hospital.

941
01:02:19,276 --> 01:02:21,904
That was so stupid of me
to rile up Jacks like that.

942
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:25,199
You're a bright boy now.
You just might deserve that bullet.

943
01:02:26,575 --> 01:02:27,910
Don't leave her alone.

944
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,079
She didn't...
She didn't...

945
01:02:30,245 --> 01:02:31,246
She could hurt herself.

946
01:02:31,413 --> 01:02:32,623
She won't.

947
01:02:33,123 --> 01:02:34,959
I've given her something to calm her down.

948
01:02:35,125 --> 01:02:36,335
I'll stay with her.

949
01:02:36,502 --> 01:02:37,962
Good. Come on.

950
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,588
Let's get him to bed.

951
01:02:39,755 --> 01:02:40,881
Careful.

952
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,758
All right, almost there.

953
01:02:42,925 --> 01:02:44,051
Here we go.

954
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,805
Steady. Steady, steady, steady.

955
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:49,306
- That's good.
- There we are.

956
01:02:49,473 --> 01:02:50,766
This should help you sleep.

957
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:57,022
Oh, God.

958
01:04:41,168 --> 01:04:42,169
Oh, God...

959
01:04:42,961 --> 01:04:45,089
Time of death?

960
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:48,926
Six hours ago.
Eight at most.

961
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:51,678
Sometime between midnight and 2:00 a.m.

962
01:04:52,971 --> 01:04:56,350
No evidence of struggle.
She died in her sleep.

963
01:04:57,184 --> 01:04:58,477
At least that.

964
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:03,398
Gun held to the temple.
There's scorch marks there.

965
01:05:06,360 --> 01:05:07,736
God...

966
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,698
One bullet.

967
01:05:11,865 --> 01:05:13,575
Small caliber.

968
01:05:14,576 --> 01:05:16,078
Probably a .22.

969
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:21,250
<i>- Practically a toy.</i>
- Practically a toy.

970
01:05:21,416 --> 01:05:23,919
Ah, good.
I was hoping you were the day shift.

971
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,295
Is someone ill?

972
01:05:25,462 --> 01:05:26,964
Someone is dead.

973
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:29,133
- Linnet Doyle.
- Linnet?

974
01:05:29,299 --> 01:05:30,634
Stop. What do you mean?
How?

975
01:05:30,801 --> 01:05:34,346
I'm afraid Jacqueline de Bellefort
has made good on her threat.

976
01:05:34,513 --> 01:05:36,265
No, that's impossible.
I was with her all night.

977
01:05:36,431 --> 01:05:38,350
She slept right here.

978
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:39,768
Out cold.

979
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:42,479
Could she have left
even for a moment?

980
01:05:42,646 --> 01:05:44,606
Did you leave her side or sleep at all?

981
01:05:44,773 --> 01:05:46,942
No, not a minute. No. Not a wink.

982
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:49,695
And even if I had,
I was scared she might hurt herself,

983
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:52,906
so I gave her enough morphia
to fell an elephant.

984
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,116
Was there a single moment

985
01:05:54,199 --> 01:05:55,492
when Mademoiselle de Bellefort
left your sight?

986
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,577
Never, no.

987
01:05:56,660 --> 01:05:57,911
So Jackie couldn't
have murdered Linnet.

988
01:05:57,995 --> 01:06:00,122
Just as she could not have
pushed a boulder onto Simon Doyle.

989
01:06:00,205 --> 01:06:01,748
What did you do
after bringing her to Miss Bowers?

990
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:04,126
We came back here
to pick up the gun and lock it away.

991
01:06:04,209 --> 01:06:05,294
I kicked it under the couch,

992
01:06:05,377 --> 01:06:06,753
but when we came back,
we couldn't find it.

993
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:08,589
- I wanted to wake you.
- I said not to.

994
01:06:08,672 --> 01:06:09,798
You did not want my assistance.

995
01:06:09,882 --> 01:06:11,717
No, stop that.
She was Linnet's friend.

996
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,428
It's all right.
He's a bloodhound, let him sniff.

997
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:17,306
Simon was with the doctor
and Jackie was with the nurse.

998
01:06:17,806 --> 01:06:19,308
I just figured it was
an awful lovers' quarrel

999
01:06:19,474 --> 01:06:20,934
and not a case for the detective.

1000
01:06:21,101 --> 01:06:24,646
Ah, but the mysterious case
of the vanishing pistol.

1001
01:06:24,813 --> 01:06:26,064
Someone locates it

1002
01:06:26,231 --> 01:06:30,235
in the moments between you bringing
Mr. Doyle to the doctor and your return,

1003
01:06:30,736 --> 01:06:34,615
and then presumably uses it
to commit the murder of Linnet Doyle

1004
01:06:34,781 --> 01:06:37,201
and part two lovers forever.

1005
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:44,124
Bouc, tell the captain
to dredge the river around the ship.

1006
01:06:44,499 --> 01:06:46,919
Simon Doyle must be told.

1007
01:06:53,884 --> 01:06:54,885
Linnet.

1008
01:06:56,011 --> 01:06:57,137
No!

1009
01:07:00,098 --> 01:07:01,391
No!

1010
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:08,106
Oh, God.
It was Jackie!

1011
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:11,485
God damn her! I could kill her!

1012
01:07:12,444 --> 01:07:15,113
Jacqueline de Bellefort
was not the killer.

1013
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:17,282
She shot me!

1014
01:07:17,449 --> 01:07:19,910
She has a concrete alibi
for the entire night

1015
01:07:20,077 --> 01:07:22,246
from the moment she fired her gun at you.

1016
01:07:23,038 --> 01:07:24,039
No.

1017
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,375
Oh, God.

1018
01:07:38,553 --> 01:07:40,013
Linnet.

1019
01:07:40,389 --> 01:07:41,723
You have to help me.

1020
01:07:41,890 --> 01:07:45,519
Please. You have to find out
who killed my wife.

1021
01:08:27,894 --> 01:08:29,271
Did you suspect any of them?

1022
01:08:31,064 --> 01:08:32,149
Everyone loved Linnet.

1023
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:35,402
Yet, your wife confessed lately
that she did not feel safe with them.

1024
01:08:38,739 --> 01:08:41,575
There... There were petty things.

1025
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,830
I, uh, wasn't crazy about her old beau
being on the ship,

1026
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:48,498
mooning over her the entire time.

1027
01:08:49,333 --> 01:08:51,418
She mentioned something about Salome.

1028
01:08:52,586 --> 01:08:54,588
Some incident that had happened years ago.

1029
01:08:54,921 --> 01:08:55,922
She didn't say what exactly.

1030
01:08:56,089 --> 01:08:58,592
What of your maid, Louise Bourget?

1031
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,260
There had been a disagreement, no?

1032
01:09:00,427 --> 01:09:03,221
It was just that Louise had left
some things at the hotel.

1033
01:09:03,388 --> 01:09:05,265
Silly things. Nail varnish.

1034
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:08,185
No. She had been with Linnet for years.

1035
01:09:08,685 --> 01:09:10,187
She even had charge of Linnet's necklace.

1036
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:12,439
- Check on the necklace.
- It's by the bed.

1037
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:13,815
Thank you, Bouc.

1038
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:19,821
It's not here.

1039
01:09:21,865 --> 01:09:23,784
So, did you see the necklace
when you came in this morning?

1040
01:09:24,576 --> 01:09:27,329
<i>Alors,</i> I saw Miss Linnet there.

1041
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:28,538
Dead.

1042
01:09:29,706 --> 01:09:31,249
I dropped the tray and ran out.

1043
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:33,251
What did she mean earlier
on the way to Abu Simbel

1044
01:09:33,418 --> 01:09:36,004
when she said the travel to Egypt
was your idea?

1045
01:09:36,171 --> 01:09:37,631
For your own honeymoon.

1046
01:09:38,215 --> 01:09:39,341
Um...

1047
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:43,345
Perhaps Miss Bourget would prefer privacy
for this intimate detail.

1048
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:44,596
So, if you could please take Mr. Doyle...

1049
01:09:44,763 --> 01:09:46,807
But, no, if you please,
I prefer Mr. Doyle hear me,

1050
01:09:46,973 --> 01:09:48,725
so he does not accuse me of a secret.

1051
01:09:48,892 --> 01:09:50,519
- Accuse you of a secret?
<i>- Oui.</i>

1052
01:09:50,685 --> 01:09:52,437
She ended my engagement.

1053
01:09:52,979 --> 01:09:55,482
Miss Linnet gave a party last year.

1054
01:09:55,649 --> 01:09:57,150
A man spoke to me,

1055
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:00,320
and found me after.

1056
01:10:00,487 --> 01:10:02,656
When he proposed, I gave notice.

1057
01:10:04,449 --> 01:10:07,285
Miss Linnet was suspect
of his intentions with me.

1058
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:08,370
Just a maid.

1059
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,122
She had him investigated.

1060
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:12,165
He had debits.

1061
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,335
She offered to pay them all off
if he would drop me,

1062
01:10:15,502 --> 01:10:19,464
to make a test of his affection.

1063
01:10:23,468 --> 01:10:24,803
He dropped me.

1064
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:29,224
For my benefit, she said.

1065
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:36,481
That same money, handed to me as a dowry,
could have given me a life.

1066
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:40,193
What did you do last night
after you left Miss Linnet?

1067
01:10:41,695 --> 01:10:43,363
I went to my cabin on the deck below.

1068
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:44,948
Did you go anywhere else?

1069
01:10:45,115 --> 01:10:46,992
See or hear anything else?

1070
01:10:47,451 --> 01:10:48,660
Forgive me, sir.

1071
01:10:49,494 --> 01:10:51,580
If I had come outside my cabin to smoke,

1072
01:10:51,746 --> 01:10:54,124
I might have seen her killer
enter or leave her cabin.

1073
01:10:54,291 --> 01:10:56,209
But you did not or you did?
What is this?

1074
01:10:56,376 --> 01:11:00,422
Uh, no, I... I did.
I did have a cigarette inside.

1075
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:03,967
You all are staring at me.
It's making me...

1076
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,845
Please. You know we kept confidences.

1077
01:11:07,012 --> 01:11:09,347
I was childish at times, but that's all.

1078
01:11:09,514 --> 01:11:11,892
Tell them. I would never hurt Miss Linnet.

1079
01:11:12,058 --> 01:11:14,144
Yes, of course. Easy, easy goes it.

1080
01:11:14,227 --> 01:11:16,313
Uh, no one here
is accusing you of anything.

1081
01:11:16,688 --> 01:11:18,857
I know you've always
taken good care of Linnet,

1082
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,776
and I will be certain to take care of you.

1083
01:11:23,361 --> 01:11:26,531
That can be enough, can't it?
Surely, we can let the poor girl go.

1084
01:11:26,698 --> 01:11:29,284
You don't think someone would kill Linnet
to steal her necklace?

1085
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,077
I've seen people poisoned for less.

1086
01:11:31,244 --> 01:11:32,454
Dredge the river.

1087
01:11:39,711 --> 01:11:41,588
Please be careful with those.

1088
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:49,930
Oh, come on.

1089
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:54,184
These are what few
private possessions I have.

1090
01:11:54,351 --> 01:11:55,977
I trust you'll be sensitive.

1091
01:12:06,321 --> 01:12:07,489
All the money in the world

1092
01:12:08,448 --> 01:12:10,575
and she's in the freezer with the hams.

1093
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:14,913
This is as much dignity
as we can afford the dead

1094
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:17,082
in these circumstances.

1095
01:12:24,631 --> 01:12:26,258
Uh, Doctor, before you go.

1096
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:32,138
You joined this wedding party
despite your obvious affection.

1097
01:12:32,305 --> 01:12:34,849
You had no reservation
to see her with another?

1098
01:12:35,016 --> 01:12:37,435
Some people you can't say no to.
She asked.

1099
01:12:37,602 --> 01:12:40,355
If I may ask a question, please,
about your passport.

1100
01:12:40,981 --> 01:12:44,651
You go by Dr. Windlesham,
but this is not your natural title.

1101
01:12:45,485 --> 01:12:47,946
- No.
- Lord Windlesham.

1102
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,782
Born to, not earned.

1103
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:54,995
What I do as Lord Windlesham
belongs to buck-toothed tradition.

1104
01:12:55,161 --> 01:12:57,247
What I do as doctor is mine.

1105
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:59,749
And Dr. Windlesham travels widely, hmm?

1106
01:12:59,916 --> 01:13:01,001
India, Africa.

1107
01:13:01,167 --> 01:13:05,797
Much of the world lacks access to modern
medicine we take for granted, Poirot.

1108
01:13:05,964 --> 01:13:09,134
Most nobility enjoy their nobility more.

1109
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:11,511
Linnet used to tease me for that.

1110
01:13:12,178 --> 01:13:15,765
Said I shouldn't expect her to honeymoon
in a mud hut.

1111
01:13:19,436 --> 01:13:22,522
Your thoughts to her were always tender.
What of the husband?

1112
01:13:23,064 --> 01:13:24,649
I don't know him well.

1113
01:13:25,317 --> 01:13:26,735
What I do know, I can't recommend.

1114
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,111
This is appropriate.

1115
01:13:28,194 --> 01:13:30,530
Mr. Doyle would have us
focus our suspicions on you.

1116
01:13:30,614 --> 01:13:31,656
Me?

1117
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,700
I was with him all last night.

1118
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:35,744
Indeed. You gave him
a strong opiate injection.

1119
01:13:35,827 --> 01:13:36,828
He was asleep.

1120
01:13:36,911 --> 01:13:39,456
You could have left him at any time
and not been observed.

1121
01:13:39,914 --> 01:13:41,750
- Did he ask for the drug?
- He was in pain.

1122
01:13:41,916 --> 01:13:44,961
There are less powerful pain medications
in your bag which would suffice.

1123
01:13:45,128 --> 01:13:47,047
You created for yourself an opportunity.

1124
01:13:47,213 --> 01:13:49,716
- I didn't create an opportunity.
- She was unkind, no?

1125
01:13:49,799 --> 01:13:52,552
She flaunted her new love,
yet still called you like the puppy dog.

1126
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:53,887
Seeing them pained you,

1127
01:13:54,054 --> 01:13:57,057
and like the strong opiate injection,
you could end your pain with a bullet.

1128
01:13:57,223 --> 01:13:58,725
Lords demand to get what they want,

1129
01:13:58,808 --> 01:13:59,851
and you are still a lord.

1130
01:13:59,934 --> 01:14:01,478
What do you want me to say?

1131
01:14:01,645 --> 01:14:03,229
What do you want me to say?

1132
01:14:03,396 --> 01:14:04,939
That I know I'm ridiculous?

1133
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:14,032
I'm not a fool.

1134
01:14:14,991 --> 01:14:17,994
I knew she was settling for me.

1135
01:14:18,912 --> 01:14:20,246
I didn't mind.

1136
01:14:23,124 --> 01:14:24,918
When she married Simon,

1137
01:14:25,669 --> 01:14:28,505
I actually thought
about ending my own life.

1138
01:14:30,173 --> 01:14:32,801
They all thought our engagement
was for the families,

1139
01:14:32,967 --> 01:14:36,179
the papers, for the damn aristocratic
theatrics of it all.

1140
01:14:39,140 --> 01:14:40,892
The shame of it is...

1141
01:14:43,019 --> 01:14:44,437
I loved her.

1142
01:14:48,983 --> 01:14:51,695
Little Linny and cousin Andrew.

1143
01:14:52,362 --> 01:14:55,198
I knew her
since we were children.

1144
01:14:55,615 --> 01:14:57,951
Were you aware of any grudges
against the family?

1145
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,703
More than many.

1146
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:02,163
Her father got rich
making rich people poor.

1147
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:04,040
Linny continued the practice.

1148
01:15:04,207 --> 01:15:05,959
Did you hear anything
of the commotion last night?

1149
01:15:06,126 --> 01:15:07,293
I was all snores by 11:00.

1150
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,963
And the contracts you wished her to sign,
they are very important?

1151
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,716
Yes. They are. Were.

1152
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:16,094
With Linny gone, the, uh,
estate will have to be redrawn.

1153
01:15:16,177 --> 01:15:17,178
May I see them?

1154
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:19,389
Forgive me. These are confidential.

1155
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:21,975
I must insist.

1156
01:15:22,142 --> 01:15:23,935
- Respect for the deceased.
- No matter, I know what they contain.

1157
01:15:24,102 --> 01:15:25,103
I doubt that very much.

1158
01:15:25,228 --> 01:15:28,648
I believe they extend your stewardship
of Madam Doyle's estate,

1159
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:30,316
despite her marriage, no?

1160
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:31,526
Who told you?

1161
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:33,486
I am Hercule Poirot.

1162
01:15:33,653 --> 01:15:35,572
I do not need to be told.
I have eyes and they see.

1163
01:15:35,655 --> 01:15:38,366
A brain and it thinks.
It now thinks somewhat poorly of you.

1164
01:15:41,077 --> 01:15:43,163
- You think I killed her?
- Did you kill her?

1165
01:15:43,329 --> 01:15:46,291
I don't benefit a dime
from her death, Mr. Poirot.

1166
01:15:46,458 --> 01:15:48,042
You can look at the will I revised.

1167
01:15:48,209 --> 01:15:50,336
A godmother stands to inherit.

1168
01:15:50,503 --> 01:15:52,797
Her husband legally gets the rest.

1169
01:15:52,964 --> 01:15:54,591
You won't see my name anywhere.

1170
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:59,095
Perhaps the intention was not to inherit,
but to conceal.

1171
01:15:59,345 --> 01:16:02,724
You executed control
over her vast fortune.

1172
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:05,894
Not a concern, so long as
there is no impropriety,

1173
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:09,898
no speculation by loyal cousin Andrew,

1174
01:16:10,190 --> 01:16:11,858
in a time of market decline.

1175
01:16:12,025 --> 01:16:14,027
This is not a kind of thing
you can prove on a boat.

1176
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:17,489
You endeavored to obtain a signature

1177
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:22,202
by trickery, from Little Linny,
and you failed.

1178
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:25,121
You knew it was only a matter of time

1179
01:16:25,288 --> 01:16:28,583
before her keen eyes
uncovered your thievery,

1180
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:32,629
unless her eyes were closed forever.

1181
01:16:35,256 --> 01:16:39,177
You see, in my position, Mr. Poirot,

1182
01:16:39,344 --> 01:16:43,640
I often have to transport items
such as canvases worth millions.

1183
01:16:43,807 --> 01:16:46,017
And they need security.

1184
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:48,645
So, if I wanted to Kill her,

1185
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,605
I would have used this.

1186
01:16:55,276 --> 01:16:56,903
A .45.

1187
01:16:57,070 --> 01:16:58,279
Yes.

1188
01:16:58,446 --> 01:16:59,489
You may go.

1189
01:17:06,621 --> 01:17:07,872
A .45.

1190
01:17:08,039 --> 01:17:09,999
Why would he risk going back
for Jackie's gun if he had that?

1191
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,292
He would not.

1192
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,171
Miss Bowers, if I might trouble you.

1193
01:17:15,338 --> 01:17:18,508
He wants to speak with me?
I'm laying down a corner.

1194
01:17:18,591 --> 01:17:20,760
There's nothing to fear.
Only you might know something of value.

1195
01:17:20,844 --> 01:17:22,554
That would be the shocking twist.

1196
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:24,180
If you wouldn't mind her coming alone.

1197
01:17:24,347 --> 01:17:26,224
I damn well would.

1198
01:17:30,603 --> 01:17:32,188
I want these
served at my funeral.

1199
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,356
Mm-hmm.

1200
01:17:33,439 --> 01:17:35,859
When you kept vigil with
Mademoiselle de Bellefort,

1201
01:17:36,025 --> 01:17:39,362
did she make threats against Linnet Doyle?

1202
01:17:39,529 --> 01:17:41,406
No, her threats were against herself.

1203
01:17:42,031 --> 01:17:44,617
She wanted to pitch herself
into the drink and not come up.

1204
01:17:44,784 --> 01:17:46,661
That's why I gave her all the morphia.

1205
01:17:46,828 --> 01:17:49,122
How fortunate that we had you with us.

1206
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:51,291
You have been a nurse companion
for how long?

1207
01:17:51,749 --> 01:17:55,128
Um... Well, coming on 10 years.

1208
01:17:55,461 --> 01:17:59,674
All with Mrs. Van Schuyler,
so it feels like 20.

1209
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:04,137
The job came to me late in life.

1210
01:18:04,304 --> 01:18:06,973
Ah, after you lost your great wealth.

1211
01:18:07,807 --> 01:18:09,684
Wealth?

1212
01:18:09,767 --> 01:18:11,728
Acquired tastes require acquisition,

1213
01:18:11,895 --> 01:18:15,607
and here, you moon over truffle
and king crabs.

1214
01:18:15,773 --> 01:18:17,400
So, too, your gown, Chanel,

1215
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:20,069
your luggage, Vuitton,
your shoes, Perugia.

1216
01:18:20,236 --> 01:18:24,365
All the peak of chic 10 years past,
worn and patched over.

1217
01:18:24,532 --> 01:18:27,785
How many years since
you had caviar, did you say?

1218
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:33,583
Many lost fortunes in the crash.

1219
01:18:33,750 --> 01:18:37,754
Many of them due to Papa Ridge way
and his unscrupulous business practices.

1220
01:18:37,921 --> 01:18:39,839
Perhaps that explains your reaction

1221
01:18:39,923 --> 01:18:43,468
to the lease of Linnet's
London property. Hmm?

1222
01:18:47,513 --> 01:18:50,516
It was once called the Bowers building.

1223
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,101
Ah...

1224
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:56,564
We employed over a thousand people,
good wages.

1225
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:00,151
We spread our wealth, when we had it.

1226
01:19:01,903 --> 01:19:05,531
So many like family.

1227
01:19:07,283 --> 01:19:09,160
Some never found work again.

1228
01:19:10,036 --> 01:19:12,705
So, yes, I miss caviar.

1229
01:19:14,248 --> 01:19:15,625
But I miss them more.

1230
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:18,419
And you, feeling as you do,
with your charge

1231
01:19:18,586 --> 01:19:20,922
Mademoiselle de Bellefort
drugged into slumber,

1232
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:22,715
you are free to move about the ship,
to find the gun,

1233
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:24,300
- to shoot Linnet Doyle...
- No!

1234
01:19:24,467 --> 01:19:25,510
He specifically asked
to see you separately.

1235
01:19:25,593 --> 01:19:26,719
- ...while she sleeps.
- Mrs. Van Schuyler.

1236
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:28,388
- Stop interfering!
- Ah! A visitor.

1237
01:19:28,554 --> 01:19:31,808
She cannot be without her Miss Bowers
for even a moment.

1238
01:19:31,975 --> 01:19:33,393
Please. Please, join us to tea, huh?

1239
01:19:33,559 --> 01:19:36,187
He's just accused me of shooting Linnet.

1240
01:19:36,270 --> 01:19:37,271
No, no, no.

1241
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:41,150
I merely, uh, suggest a possibility.

1242
01:19:41,693 --> 01:19:44,028
I don't approve
of this interrogation.

1243
01:19:44,195 --> 01:19:46,280
I mean, who are you to question us?

1244
01:19:46,447 --> 01:19:48,241
I am the working man.

1245
01:19:48,408 --> 01:19:52,912
The skilled laborer,
the hero of your own economic fairy tales.

1246
01:19:53,079 --> 01:19:56,374
Well, I don't care for it. Or for you.

1247
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:59,877
You are meant to be finding the killer

1248
01:20:00,044 --> 01:20:01,796
of my goddaughter.

1249
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:07,218
I never had children of my own.

1250
01:20:09,137 --> 01:20:10,847
I had Linnet.

1251
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,558
You are aware, of course,

1252
01:20:13,725 --> 01:20:17,437
that you are a key beneficiary
in Linnet Doyle's will.

1253
01:20:19,105 --> 01:20:20,940
You accuse me now of murder?

1254
01:20:21,107 --> 01:20:22,567
Oh, no, he accuses everyone of murder.

1255
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,027
It is a problem, I admit.

1256
01:20:24,819 --> 01:20:30,241
That I would Kill
my own goddaughter for money?

1257
01:20:31,826 --> 01:20:34,287
I already gave away a fortune.

1258
01:20:34,454 --> 01:20:36,372
I don't give a fig for money.

1259
01:20:37,123 --> 01:20:39,834
I see no reason to continue
this conversation. Come on, Bowers.

1260
01:20:40,001 --> 01:20:43,337
The stewards on this ship keep
an excellent room. Have you noticed?

1261
01:20:43,546 --> 01:20:47,008
A truly first-rate housekeeping staff.

1262
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,384
He's off his rails.

1263
01:20:48,551 --> 01:20:49,719
Beds made every day,

1264
01:20:49,886 --> 01:20:53,848
sheets folded in marvelously precise
45-degree hospital corners, I must say.

1265
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:57,101
Unlike, for example, the day we departed,

1266
01:20:57,268 --> 01:21:02,940
when the beds were made
in the flowing edged bedspread style.

1267
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:05,943
But, you know, when I saw
Mademoiselle de Bellefort

1268
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:09,655
asleep in Miss Bowers' room
on our third day aboard,

1269
01:21:10,281 --> 01:21:14,452
<i>the bed was as it had been on our first.</i>

1270
01:21:14,619 --> 01:21:17,205
As yet unslept in.

1271
01:21:18,456 --> 01:21:19,749
Bouc,

1272
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:23,711
where did you find Miss Bowers
when you sought her aid?

1273
01:21:23,878 --> 01:21:25,922
In Mrs. Van Schuyler's room.

1274
01:21:28,091 --> 01:21:29,300
My mind asks...

1275
01:21:30,134 --> 01:21:35,223
Here is a woman for whom the fire against
class and materialism burns so hot

1276
01:21:35,389 --> 01:21:37,683
and yet she keeps a servant?

1277
01:21:38,434 --> 01:21:39,560
No.

1278
01:21:41,354 --> 01:21:43,147
Her servant is no servant...

1279
01:21:44,315 --> 01:21:47,652
nor nurse, only companion.

1280
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:50,488
Let us name the reason.

1281
01:21:50,655 --> 01:21:51,823
Love.

1282
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:56,285
Don't worry.

1283
01:21:58,663 --> 01:21:59,831
And I know this.

1284
01:21:59,997 --> 01:22:01,457
It's all right.

1285
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:06,879
People kill for love.

1286
01:22:07,046 --> 01:22:08,214
They found something!

1287
01:22:10,133 --> 01:22:11,134
What?

1288
01:22:11,217 --> 01:22:13,136
They found something!

1289
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:14,804
Monsieur Poirot.

1290
01:22:16,472 --> 01:22:18,432
Well done, young man.
Go and get yourself cleaned up.

1291
01:22:18,516 --> 01:22:19,517
Yes, sir.

1292
01:22:19,600 --> 01:22:20,726
It's your scarf.

1293
01:22:21,477 --> 01:22:24,188
But it went missing.
I've been looking for it since the temple.

1294
01:22:24,355 --> 01:22:26,649
It's true.
We couldn't find it anywhere.

1295
01:22:31,070 --> 01:22:34,365
It has had
an adventure in your absence.

1296
01:22:34,532 --> 01:22:37,493
Your scarf, complete with bullet holes...

1297
01:22:40,246 --> 01:22:42,290
Used to dampen the noise of a shot.

1298
01:22:42,456 --> 01:22:43,875
Also a bloodied handkerchief

1299
01:22:44,041 --> 01:22:47,587
and the .22 derringer
belonging to Jacqueline de Bellefort.

1300
01:22:49,422 --> 01:22:50,965
Two bullets fired.

1301
01:22:51,048 --> 01:22:53,718
<i>We return immediately to Assouan.</i>

1302
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,265
Ooh, I like this.

1303
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:02,018
The full force of his forceful attention.

1304
01:23:02,185 --> 01:23:04,520
The great mind, all mine.

1305
01:23:04,937 --> 01:23:07,231
Flirtation, however delightful,
will have no effect.

1306
01:23:07,940 --> 01:23:10,067
A woman shows you a direct bit of interest

1307
01:23:10,234 --> 01:23:12,445
and you assume
it can only be to hide guilt.

1308
01:23:14,197 --> 01:23:16,991
Whoever she was
must've done a number on you.

1309
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:20,745
That mask covers your whole face,
doesn't it?

1310
01:23:24,498 --> 01:23:27,251
You knew Linnet Doyle before you came
to entertain us, yes?

1311
01:23:27,418 --> 01:23:29,420
- Paths crossed.
- You did not like her?

1312
01:23:29,503 --> 01:23:30,504
I stay polite.

1313
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:34,133
Monsieur Doyle mentioned an incident
with the victim long ago.

1314
01:23:34,425 --> 01:23:37,220
A reason for possible animosity.

1315
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:41,682
Poolside, Kennebunkport.

1316
01:23:41,849 --> 01:23:44,518
Summer of '24, before I was someone.

1317
01:23:44,685 --> 01:23:46,354
I played a show at the hotel

1318
01:23:46,437 --> 01:23:49,565
and thought to take Rosie
for a swim before packing.

1319
01:23:50,191 --> 01:23:52,360
A young girl complained to her papa

1320
01:23:52,443 --> 01:23:54,820
about having to share the pool
with a colored.

1321
01:23:54,987 --> 01:23:58,115
We were told to leave,
and when I did not abide,

1322
01:23:58,199 --> 01:23:59,700
I was made to.

1323
01:24:00,576 --> 01:24:04,372
I wasn't sure she'd even remember it.
I do.

1324
01:24:04,538 --> 01:24:05,706
It was '25.

1325
01:24:07,291 --> 01:24:08,626
So does she.

1326
01:24:10,169 --> 01:24:11,170
Mademoiselle.

1327
01:24:13,839 --> 01:24:16,050
She shamed you in front of your ward.

1328
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:17,218
Monsieur Poirot,

1329
01:24:17,385 --> 01:24:19,929
if I put a bullet in everyone
who took a potshot at me

1330
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,889
for not keeping to my place,

1331
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:25,434
the world would be littered
with dead white ladies.

1332
01:24:25,601 --> 01:24:27,728
Linnet was just a kid back then.

1333
01:24:29,021 --> 01:24:30,856
Taught by a bad daddy.

1334
01:24:31,565 --> 01:24:33,859
But she became my friend
in boarding school.

1335
01:24:34,860 --> 01:24:36,988
Gave the other girls license
to do the same.

1336
01:24:38,322 --> 01:24:39,573
Truth to tell...

1337
01:24:40,741 --> 01:24:43,577
Linnet was as easy to hate as love.

1338
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:46,497
I might have done both.

1339
01:24:47,790 --> 01:24:49,875
That is a very honest reply.

1340
01:24:51,127 --> 01:24:52,878
I thank you both for your time, mesdames.

1341
01:24:53,045 --> 01:24:56,173
There was one final question.
It is a curiosity of mine.

1342
01:24:56,382 --> 01:24:58,843
Your hat.
In the turban style.

1343
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:01,637
As many times as I have seen you,
you have always worn one like I,

1344
01:25:01,804 --> 01:25:03,097
but it is out of the fashion, no?

1345
01:25:03,931 --> 01:25:05,933
Not when I wear it.

1346
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:11,105
If you would indulge me,
please, to remove it.

1347
01:25:11,188 --> 01:25:13,858
- Mm-mm.
- Oh! It's all right, Rosie.

1348
01:25:14,025 --> 01:25:16,819
He's driving at an answer
he already knows.

1349
01:25:23,242 --> 01:25:26,537
.22 caliber, like the one
that killed Linnet Doyle.

1350
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,664
I've used it, if you wanna ask.

1351
01:25:28,831 --> 01:25:31,375
Twice in defense, once in anger.

1352
01:25:31,542 --> 01:25:33,919
Last night was not that once.

1353
01:25:34,337 --> 01:25:35,796
You tell me if I'm lying.

1354
01:25:35,963 --> 01:25:37,506
Mr. Poirot.

1355
01:25:37,715 --> 01:25:38,716
Monsieur.

1356
01:25:38,799 --> 01:25:40,468
You interrupt at a poor time, madame.

1357
01:25:40,676 --> 01:25:41,844
You're meant to be the detective,

1358
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:45,014
yet I found this.

1359
01:25:48,351 --> 01:25:51,687
It was there,
right in my vanity drawer,

1360
01:25:51,854 --> 01:25:53,606
face up like a yolk.

1361
01:25:56,400 --> 01:25:57,735
You know I didn't take it.

1362
01:25:57,902 --> 01:25:59,737
No. Which is why
our killer has remanded it

1363
01:25:59,820 --> 01:26:01,030
to your custody to return.

1364
01:26:01,197 --> 01:26:02,239
- Thank you.
- Unless...

1365
01:26:02,406 --> 01:26:03,616
- Poirot.
- Unless what?

1366
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:06,827
Unless you took the necklace
to steer suspicion away from you.

1367
01:26:06,952 --> 01:26:09,705
Evidence is easily disposed of
over the ship's railing.

1368
01:26:09,872 --> 01:26:13,376
Whoever did this made a show of discovery.

1369
01:26:13,542 --> 01:26:15,294
Why would my mother murder Linnet?

1370
01:26:15,461 --> 01:26:18,172
Bouc, you said your mother was
furious with Linnet for making you a pair.

1371
01:26:18,339 --> 01:26:20,549
Madame, it was Linnet Doyle
who introduced your son

1372
01:26:20,633 --> 01:26:23,052
- to a woman you distrust, no?
- Rest assured,

1373
01:26:23,135 --> 01:26:26,305
if I had a bullet in my pocket
to correct my son's poor taste,

1374
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:28,140
I would not spend it on Mrs. Doyle.

1375
01:26:28,307 --> 01:26:29,683
Mother, please, that is not helping.

1376
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:32,269
Perhaps. But I have seen
your excellent landscapes.

1377
01:26:32,436 --> 01:26:36,315
You are a patient woman who achieves
every effect she intends in time.

1378
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:40,444
Who so diligently planned
to have me aboard this ship,

1379
01:26:40,611 --> 01:26:45,199
yet with my suspicions
diverted in another direction.

1380
01:26:45,366 --> 01:26:46,534
That is a private affair.

1381
01:26:46,700 --> 01:26:48,285
That is a concluded affair, madame.

1382
01:26:48,452 --> 01:26:50,287
- Enough.
- Enough indeed.

1383
01:26:50,454 --> 01:26:52,456
I am now prepared
to present the conclusions

1384
01:26:52,623 --> 01:26:55,876
of my other, more secret case
and put it to rest.

1385
01:26:56,293 --> 01:26:57,795
Secret case?
What?

1386
01:26:58,671 --> 01:26:59,880
What does he mean?

1387
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:01,507
Mother?

1388
01:27:05,636 --> 01:27:07,471
- Monsieur.
- Mademoiselle.

1389
01:27:12,309 --> 01:27:14,353
Mesdames, thank you for joining us.

1390
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:15,729
Bouc.

1391
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:18,983
I will make my own confession.

1392
01:27:19,567 --> 01:27:23,195
When we met in Giza, I told you
I was on vacation from my detective work

1393
01:27:23,362 --> 01:27:27,575
when in fact,
I was and have been on a case.

1394
01:27:27,741 --> 01:27:28,951
What case?

1395
01:27:29,785 --> 01:27:30,786
You.

1396
01:27:31,454 --> 01:27:33,330
At the request of your mother,
Madame Bouc,

1397
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:36,041
who cabled me in distress
some weeks ago.

1398
01:27:36,208 --> 01:27:37,877
My mother, in distress?

1399
01:27:38,043 --> 01:27:39,545
I was bidden to follow the Otterbournes

1400
01:27:39,712 --> 01:27:43,382
to determine the character and fitness
of the show business woman

1401
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:44,717
who had stolen your heart.

1402
01:27:45,968 --> 01:27:46,969
You did this to me?

1403
01:27:47,136 --> 01:27:48,929
I'm your mother. I've done far worse.

1404
01:27:49,096 --> 01:27:50,181
To observe them,

1405
01:27:50,347 --> 01:27:53,058
I had to consume many doses
of the bluesy music,

1406
01:27:53,225 --> 01:27:55,478
which, I confess,
I did not expect to enjoy,

1407
01:27:55,561 --> 01:27:56,896
but, in fact, I did very much

1408
01:27:57,062 --> 01:27:58,397
as performed by Madame Otterbourne.

1409
01:27:58,481 --> 01:28:00,983
It was unusual for me,
but it was very nice.

1410
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:02,693
That's why you were in Giza.

1411
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:04,820
How we met "accidentally."

1412
01:28:04,987 --> 01:28:05,988
I am sorry.

1413
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:07,823
I had to make you see what she is.

1414
01:28:07,990 --> 01:28:09,200
Tell him, Detective.

1415
01:28:09,783 --> 01:28:10,993
I will tell you, Bouc.

1416
01:28:13,454 --> 01:28:15,122
Having observed Rosalie Otterbourne,

1417
01:28:15,289 --> 01:28:16,999
having inspected
her books of accounting...

1418
01:28:17,208 --> 01:28:19,168
<i>Yes, I know, please forgive me, madame.</i>

1419
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:20,336
What?

1420
01:28:20,503 --> 01:28:22,421
...I can tell you,
she gambles frequently,

1421
01:28:22,505 --> 01:28:24,006
though frequently wins.

1422
01:28:24,173 --> 01:28:27,551
She drinks little, she tips well,
she pays her employees,

1423
01:28:27,718 --> 01:28:30,763
and her taxes on time to the dime.

1424
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,599
She is diligent, she is forthright.

1425
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:36,143
In business, perhaps even virtuosic.

1426
01:28:36,310 --> 01:28:38,062
Though at piano, sadly, amateur.

1427
01:28:39,939 --> 01:28:43,025
As for her adopted mother,
she drinks to excess twice a week or more.

1428
01:28:43,192 --> 01:28:46,111
She smokes cigarettes
of various compositions.

1429
01:28:46,278 --> 01:28:48,656
And I believe that at least two
of her marriages were not...

1430
01:28:48,739 --> 01:28:50,157
I think, strictly legally ended.

1431
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:53,536
But she is a magnificent personality.

1432
01:28:53,911 --> 01:28:54,912
Mm.

1433
01:28:54,995 --> 01:28:58,541
I do not yet know
who murdered Linnet Doyle.

1434
01:28:59,625 --> 01:29:01,001
But I do know this...

1435
01:29:01,585 --> 01:29:05,923
Rosalie Otterbourne is irrevocably in love
with your son and is his better in virtue.

1436
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:08,842
She is more than fit.
She is a find.

1437
01:29:12,888 --> 01:29:14,807
It wasn't enough that we're happy.

1438
01:29:14,974 --> 01:29:18,811
I did not trust her.
Despite the detective, I still don't.

1439
01:29:18,978 --> 01:29:21,564
I love her.
That has to count for something.

1440
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:22,815
Why should it?

1441
01:29:23,315 --> 01:29:25,234
Corinthians had it wrong on every point.

1442
01:29:25,401 --> 01:29:26,902
Love isn't patient or kind.

1443
01:29:27,069 --> 01:29:29,822
It envies and boasts and doesn't care
who gets mowed down.

1444
01:29:29,989 --> 01:29:32,324
It angers, it is irritable,
it keeps record

1445
01:29:32,408 --> 01:29:33,742
of every transgression against it,

1446
01:29:33,909 --> 01:29:35,869
and good God, it fails.

1447
01:29:36,036 --> 01:29:38,706
Sure as a face ages, love fails.

1448
01:29:38,872 --> 01:29:41,834
He really wants your permission,
but he doesn't need it.

1449
01:29:42,334 --> 01:29:44,587
Any more than I need
to meet your standard.

1450
01:29:44,753 --> 01:29:46,005
Or yours.

1451
01:29:47,131 --> 01:29:48,966
I've had a chance to observe you.

1452
01:29:50,968 --> 01:29:52,928
Wanna know what I make of your character?

1453
01:29:54,805 --> 01:29:59,602
He is obsessive,
IS vain, is smug,

1454
01:29:59,768 --> 01:30:02,062
is lonely for a reason.

1455
01:30:02,229 --> 01:30:06,025
A detestable, tiresome, bombastic,

1456
01:30:06,191 --> 01:30:08,152
egocentric little freak.

1457
01:30:09,987 --> 01:30:11,447
How dare you?

1458
01:30:13,407 --> 01:30:14,742
Get out of my way.

1459
01:30:15,242 --> 01:30:16,410
- Mademoiselle, if I may.
- Ooh.

1460
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:19,830
Miss Otterbourne,
I owe you an explanation.

1461
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,417
Please. Allow me to apologize.

1462
01:30:23,584 --> 01:30:24,752
Have you ever met a man

1463
01:30:24,835 --> 01:30:26,670
who says his own name
as many times

1464
01:30:26,754 --> 01:30:27,963
as Hercule Poirot...

1465
01:30:49,026 --> 01:30:50,319
<i>Confirmed.</i>

1466
01:30:51,445 --> 01:30:53,864
<i>It is Louise Bourget.</i>

1467
01:30:54,406 --> 01:30:55,783
There's no sign of drowning.

1468
01:30:55,949 --> 01:30:57,284
They threw the body in after.

1469
01:30:57,451 --> 01:30:59,828
She must have got caught up in the paddle.

1470
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:02,247
She was murdered on board.

1471
01:31:02,706 --> 01:31:04,541
Within the last hour.

1472
01:31:07,211 --> 01:31:08,337
Money.

1473
01:31:09,171 --> 01:31:10,589
Covered in blood.

1474
01:31:12,174 --> 01:31:15,260
Louise Bourget hinted that

1475
01:31:15,427 --> 01:31:19,431
she might have seen
the killer make an escape.

1476
01:31:20,766 --> 01:31:26,563
If indeed she had, she might have
offered her silence for a sum of money.

1477
01:31:26,730 --> 01:31:28,399
A blackmail.

1478
01:31:30,567 --> 01:31:33,696
Only the killer preferred
her silence absolute.

1479
01:31:35,781 --> 01:31:38,283
Her throat, cut clean. The blade...

1480
01:31:40,244 --> 01:31:41,245
short.

1481
01:31:41,954 --> 01:31:44,623
Very sharp. Like a...

1482
01:31:47,626 --> 01:31:48,794
Like a scalpel.

1483
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:54,091
You!

1484
01:31:54,633 --> 01:31:55,718
You killed them!

1485
01:31:56,635 --> 01:31:58,679
It was... It was his scalpel!

1486
01:31:59,388 --> 01:32:01,181
He killed Louise!

1487
01:32:01,348 --> 01:32:03,225
And she saw him leaving Linny's cabin.

1488
01:32:04,017 --> 01:32:06,103
You've been lying ever since.

1489
01:32:06,270 --> 01:32:09,022
You're the one
Linnet should never have trusted.

1490
01:32:09,189 --> 01:32:12,443
I always told her your firm
was bilking her for millions.

1491
01:32:12,609 --> 01:32:13,694
You murderer!

1492
01:32:14,945 --> 01:32:16,280
I will kill you!

1493
01:32:16,363 --> 01:32:18,323
Hey, stop it!

1494
01:32:20,284 --> 01:32:21,326
Get off of me!

1495
01:33:02,534 --> 01:33:04,536
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1496
01:33:04,703 --> 01:33:06,497
Have some respect!

1497
01:33:09,249 --> 01:33:11,668
How many have to die
before you do something?

1498
01:33:11,835 --> 01:33:14,379
A throat cut while
you run me over the coals.

1499
01:33:14,546 --> 01:33:15,839
He's trying.

1500
01:33:16,006 --> 01:33:17,549
Well, he'd better try harder,

1501
01:33:17,716 --> 01:33:20,219
or we'll all wind up
in an Egyptian jail cell.

1502
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:25,140
If you won't name the killer, I will.

1503
01:33:25,849 --> 01:33:26,850
No.

1504
01:33:28,143 --> 01:33:29,812
He loved Linnet too much.

1505
01:33:30,521 --> 01:33:31,772
There's your motive right there.

1506
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:35,192
Look, all of you just keep quiet
and let Poirot work.

1507
01:33:35,943 --> 01:33:37,945
In any case,
we'll reach the port by morning.

1508
01:33:38,695 --> 01:33:40,614
For now, it's safest if we
just keep to our own cabins

1509
01:33:40,781 --> 01:33:42,407
with the doors locked.

1510
01:34:10,435 --> 01:34:12,396
She was engaged for a time.

1511
01:34:12,896 --> 01:34:14,147
I'll have to write

1512
01:34:14,314 --> 01:34:16,984
and let him know that she's...
gone.

1513
01:34:17,860 --> 01:34:20,279
They broke it off, but he'd want to know.

1514
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:22,865
That's good of you.

1515
01:34:28,912 --> 01:34:31,582
It's horrible.
All of it, horrible.

1516
01:34:32,708 --> 01:34:34,459
Who could do such a thing?

1517
01:34:35,419 --> 01:34:39,214
You must have some theory,
Monsieur Poirot.

1518
01:34:42,384 --> 01:34:43,635
Don't you?

1519
01:34:43,802 --> 01:34:46,513
I have one final interview to conduct.

1520
01:34:52,352 --> 01:34:53,562
Full speed!

1521
01:34:59,902 --> 01:35:01,653
As I have allowed affection

1522
01:35:01,820 --> 01:35:03,947
to color the clarity of my thoughts
in your investigation,

1523
01:35:04,114 --> 01:35:06,867
I must ask you to remain
as witness to this interview.

1524
01:35:10,120 --> 01:35:12,080
How long did you know Linnet Doyle?

1525
01:35:13,206 --> 01:35:14,207
I'm a suspect now?

1526
01:35:14,374 --> 01:35:15,584
How long did you know Linnet Doyle?

1527
01:35:15,751 --> 01:35:17,461
I know your tricks.

1528
01:35:17,628 --> 01:35:20,422
I've seen this play before
from that side of the table.

1529
01:35:24,217 --> 01:35:25,636
A long time.

1530
01:35:27,596 --> 01:35:30,349
We weren't close, just familiar.

1531
01:35:30,515 --> 01:35:32,768
My parents considered her parents
their equals,

1532
01:35:32,935 --> 01:35:37,898
SO we grew up at the same parties
and wound up kissing each other's friends.

1533
01:35:38,065 --> 01:35:40,692
You can't catch me at anything
because I haven't done anything.

1534
01:35:40,859 --> 01:35:42,736
So, ask whatever you like.

1535
01:35:45,572 --> 01:35:47,157
Where is your coat?

1536
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:58,543
Why did you not wake Linnet
when Simon was shot?

1537
01:35:58,710 --> 01:35:59,795
Poirot.

1538
01:36:01,588 --> 01:36:02,589
Don't.

1539
01:36:02,756 --> 01:36:04,007
Her husband was shot.

1540
01:36:04,633 --> 01:36:06,468
You have such sympathy
for the former fiancé

1541
01:36:06,551 --> 01:36:07,552
of Louise Bourget.

1542
01:36:07,719 --> 01:36:09,554
You wish to inform him of her fate.

1543
01:36:09,721 --> 01:36:12,057
Yet, you do not spare
the same sympathy for Linnet.

1544
01:36:12,224 --> 01:36:13,517
I thought she would be asleep.

1545
01:36:13,684 --> 01:36:15,811
She said that she had taken
a sleeping pill.

1546
01:36:15,978 --> 01:36:17,437
Rubbish!

1547
01:36:17,604 --> 01:36:20,899
God, I was so happy to see you, Bouc.

1548
01:36:22,442 --> 01:36:24,611
But you lie to me.

1549
01:36:24,778 --> 01:36:26,780
You lie in my face!

1550
01:36:31,076 --> 01:36:33,328
And now, you make yourself my prey.

1551
01:36:34,371 --> 01:36:36,665
What happened?
Did he kill Linnet?

1552
01:36:36,832 --> 01:36:38,542
Was it you
and Rosalie together?

1553
01:36:38,709 --> 01:36:41,503
No, she is honest.
Too proud to live well from theft.

1554
01:36:41,670 --> 01:36:43,672
- You alone did this.
- No, I didn't.

1555
01:36:43,839 --> 01:36:46,842
You returned to the parlor alone,
to find the gun and you did.

1556
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:50,178
You then went to the Doyles' cabin
to inform Linnet about Simon.

1557
01:36:50,804 --> 01:36:53,849
She was sleeping. You saw the necklace.
You were assaulted by temptation.

1558
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,308
But she woke, catching you,
so you shot her.

1559
01:36:55,392 --> 01:36:56,393
No, I didn't. That's not...

1560
01:36:56,560 --> 01:37:00,647
Only Louise Bourget saw you leaving
and demanded money.

1561
01:37:00,814 --> 01:37:02,065
Instead, you brought her a blade.

1562
01:37:02,232 --> 01:37:03,900
- No, I didn't Kill...
- Two murders!

1563
01:37:03,984 --> 01:37:07,988
All to secure a stolen fortune
so you would not need permission to marry,

1564
01:37:08,155 --> 01:37:09,322
only her blessing.

1565
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:12,159
I didn't kill anyone.

1566
01:37:12,325 --> 01:37:14,745
I never found a gun.
That's not what happened.

1567
01:37:16,329 --> 01:37:19,041
No, you did not kill anyone.

1568
01:37:19,207 --> 01:37:21,001
Linnet Doyle's murder was premeditated.

1569
01:37:21,168 --> 01:37:23,462
It required exact timing, a stolen scarf.

1570
01:37:23,628 --> 01:37:27,174
You did not kill her, but
you did go to the Doyles' cabin

1571
01:37:27,758 --> 01:37:30,677
and found Linnet already dead.

1572
01:37:31,303 --> 01:37:34,264
You knew she had been killed
before all of us.

1573
01:37:34,431 --> 01:37:36,600
But instead of calling for help...

1574
01:37:38,935 --> 01:37:40,228
you took the necklace.

1575
01:37:45,025 --> 01:37:47,819
After I told you of the cabin search,
you attempted to return it.

1576
01:37:47,986 --> 01:37:52,699
But you came upon Louise Bourget
arguing with someone, demanding money.

1577
01:37:52,866 --> 01:37:54,659
You saw her throat cut.

1578
01:37:56,161 --> 01:37:58,455
<i>You saw her murdered.</i>

1579
01:37:59,289 --> 01:38:00,499
You know who killed Louise?

1580
01:38:00,582 --> 01:38:02,918
But you could not say,
not without admitting you stole,

1581
01:38:03,085 --> 01:38:06,838
so you hid it in your mother's room.
Believing that she would catch no blame.

1582
01:38:07,589 --> 01:38:09,341
While you remained silent.

1583
01:38:11,134 --> 01:38:13,428
Only you had Louise Bourget's blood
on your coat.

1584
01:38:20,977 --> 01:38:21,978
If...

1585
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:26,316
If 1 admit this, if I say it...

1586
01:38:26,483 --> 01:38:28,318
You will face punishment
for theft.

1587
01:38:28,401 --> 01:38:29,486
You will face prison.

1588
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:32,239
I'll... I'll lose Rosalie.

1589
01:38:32,405 --> 01:38:34,032
She loves you.

1590
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:36,451
I can't...

1591
01:38:36,618 --> 01:38:39,913
You cannot let a killer go free
to protect yourself.

1592
01:38:43,625 --> 01:38:45,168
I wanted to tell you.

1593
01:38:49,089 --> 01:38:50,882
All I thought was how...

1594
01:38:53,802 --> 01:38:55,637
All I thought was how happy we'd be.

1595
01:38:57,305 --> 01:38:59,182
We could run off and get married.

1596
01:39:00,058 --> 01:39:02,185
No obligations. We'd be free.

1597
01:39:03,937 --> 01:39:05,147
Stupid!

1598
01:39:05,313 --> 01:39:07,691
It was so stupid, I know.

1599
01:39:08,692 --> 01:39:10,152
Who did you see her with?

1600
01:39:14,406 --> 01:39:16,283
You were a terrible friend, Poirot.

1601
01:39:17,492 --> 01:39:19,870
Why did you have to teach me to be good?

1602
01:39:20,036 --> 01:39:21,037
Who?

1603
01:39:21,204 --> 01:39:22,914
You could never understand...

1604
01:39:24,166 --> 01:39:27,085
what people will do for love.

1605
01:39:27,252 --> 01:39:28,253
Come on!

1606
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:32,716
No.

1607
01:39:33,049 --> 01:39:35,468
<i>Mon ami, Bouc.</i> Huh?

1608
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,470
Bouc?

1609
01:40:16,885 --> 01:40:18,094
I heard gunshots.

1610
01:40:19,095 --> 01:40:21,223
- I heard a shot.
- What's going on?

1611
01:40:22,307 --> 01:40:23,558
Did you catch him?

1612
01:40:23,975 --> 01:40:25,894
Poirot, did you catch whoever it was?

1613
01:40:52,504 --> 01:40:53,755
What is it?

1614
01:40:54,297 --> 01:40:55,840
Was someone hurt?

1615
01:41:08,353 --> 01:41:13,108
I have never seen anyone so happy as he...

1616
01:41:14,985 --> 01:41:16,695
when he was with you.

1617
01:41:21,658 --> 01:41:25,161
He told me how much he hoped
you'd be happy one day, too.

1618
01:41:27,163 --> 01:41:31,167
That you'd get tired of being
just a pure cold detective.

1619
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,838
Be human instead.

1620
01:41:42,012 --> 01:41:43,763
I don't want you happy.

1621
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:53,023
I want you to find who did this.

1622
01:42:43,406 --> 01:42:44,866
It was your gun that shot him.

1623
01:42:45,075 --> 01:42:46,368
It was his gun!

1624
01:42:46,534 --> 01:42:48,286
- I was in here!
- His gun!

1625
01:42:48,578 --> 01:42:50,705
I was here.

1626
01:42:50,789 --> 01:42:52,749
Well, you were there.
You saw me. Tell her.

1627
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:54,417
It's true. He was in here.

1628
01:42:54,501 --> 01:42:55,502
No.

1629
01:42:55,585 --> 01:42:58,254
My pistol was in my suitcase
in my cabin and...

1630
01:42:58,421 --> 01:43:00,840
Why would you leave your gun
with a killer on board?

1631
01:43:01,007 --> 01:43:02,175
Because...

1632
01:43:03,176 --> 01:43:05,345
we'd be at port by sunrise.

1633
01:43:05,512 --> 01:43:08,515
If the local police saw a dark man
holding a gun,

1634
01:43:08,681 --> 01:43:11,059
they'd shoot me before I ever saw a noose.

1635
01:43:21,111 --> 01:43:23,363
You have failed...

1636
01:43:25,448 --> 01:43:27,200
your every duty.

1637
01:43:28,993 --> 01:43:30,537
His friend.

1638
01:43:31,704 --> 01:43:33,123
I did fail.

1639
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:35,417
Linnet Doyle.

1640
01:43:36,459 --> 01:43:37,794
Louise Bourget.

1641
01:43:38,628 --> 01:43:39,671
Bouc.

1642
01:43:40,755 --> 01:43:43,049
I will not fail him now.

1643
01:43:58,064 --> 01:43:59,774
The murderer is here.

1644
01:44:03,194 --> 01:44:04,946
And will stay here.

1645
01:44:22,547 --> 01:44:24,799
Miss Otterbourne is right. I love to talk.

1646
01:44:24,966 --> 01:44:26,092
An audience.

1647
01:44:26,259 --> 01:44:27,343
I am vain, you see.

1648
01:44:28,261 --> 01:44:30,972
I love people to hear me
bring the solution to a crime and say,

1649
01:44:31,139 --> 01:44:33,475
"See, how clever is Hercule Poirot."

1650
01:44:34,225 --> 01:44:38,730
When all I want now,
would give anything for...

1651
01:44:40,523 --> 01:44:43,109
is one conversation...

1652
01:44:43,276 --> 01:44:44,611
with Bouc.

1653
01:44:45,445 --> 01:44:48,406
I would stomp about and say,
"Around a person like Linnet Doyle

1654
01:44:48,573 --> 01:44:51,284
"there are so many conflicting hates
and jealousies.

1655
01:44:51,451 --> 01:44:53,578
"It is like the cloud of flies,
buzzing, buzzing."

1656
01:44:53,745 --> 01:44:55,121
And he would laugh at me.

1657
01:44:55,288 --> 01:44:58,082
“Then play your clever games,"
he would say.

1658
01:44:58,249 --> 01:45:00,919
"Ask your questions
till the right one comes."

1659
01:45:01,836 --> 01:45:04,923
"Who would want to kill her?

1660
01:45:05,089 --> 01:45:06,174
"Who could have?"

1661
01:45:06,341 --> 01:45:07,592
And then, I would ask and I would see.

1662
01:45:07,759 --> 01:45:11,012
Yes, Bouc showed me too late.

1663
01:45:11,763 --> 01:45:14,140
A person in love will do anything.

1664
01:45:15,308 --> 01:45:17,685
Love makes us do reckless things.
Rash things.

1665
01:45:17,852 --> 01:45:18,978
A boulder falls, rash.

1666
01:45:19,145 --> 01:45:20,939
Louise murdered, wild.
Bouc, shot.

1667
01:45:23,316 --> 01:45:26,361
I had believed the identity
of Madame Doyle's killer was obvious.

1668
01:45:32,200 --> 01:45:33,868
Cousin Andrew Katchadourian.

1669
01:45:37,789 --> 01:45:40,416
Doing as he did
at the Temple of Abu Simbel,

1670
01:45:40,583 --> 01:45:42,585
<i>where he wandered off alone, desperate.</i>

1671
01:45:42,752 --> 01:45:45,421
Where he saw an opportunity.
Hoping to hide his sins under a rock...

1672
01:45:49,342 --> 01:45:50,343
...he pushes one.

1673
01:45:52,303 --> 01:45:53,388
I...

1674
01:45:53,471 --> 01:45:56,474
I don't know what I was thinking.

1675
01:45:57,100 --> 01:45:58,184
I...

1676
01:46:01,896 --> 01:46:04,440
I wasn't... I wasn't thinking.

1677
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:08,403
I saw them below.

1678
01:46:10,405 --> 01:46:13,408
And... And thank God I missed.

1679
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:16,077
And you must all know...

1680
01:46:17,745 --> 01:46:20,623
I didn't kill her.
I would never do that.

1681
01:46:21,499 --> 01:46:22,500
I... I loved her.

1682
01:46:25,044 --> 01:46:26,421
I didn't kill her!

1683
01:46:26,588 --> 01:46:27,672
No, he did not.

1684
01:46:28,923 --> 01:46:31,843
Linnet Doyle's murder was not a wild act.
It was methodically planned.

1685
01:46:32,010 --> 01:46:34,095
The details, the times,
the bullets, the alibis.

1686
01:46:34,262 --> 01:46:36,222
But planned by who?

1687
01:46:37,140 --> 01:46:39,851
I turn to Bouc once more.

1688
01:46:40,310 --> 01:46:42,520
Why did you paint him in a green jacket?

1689
01:46:42,687 --> 01:46:44,606
He wore red on the pyramid.

1690
01:46:45,607 --> 01:46:47,525
My red paint went missing.

1691
01:46:48,026 --> 01:46:49,652
It was stolen

1692
01:46:50,361 --> 01:46:53,156
by Linnet Doyle's murderer.

1693
01:46:53,781 --> 01:46:57,577
By her husband, Simon Doyle.

1694
01:46:59,871 --> 01:47:00,872
Me?

1695
01:47:01,456 --> 01:47:02,707
That's ridiculous.

1696
01:47:02,874 --> 01:47:04,042
How could he? He was shot.

1697
01:47:04,208 --> 01:47:05,501
Yes, he was shot.
We know this for certain.

1698
01:47:05,668 --> 01:47:07,795
What we do not know for certain
is when he was shot.

1699
01:47:07,962 --> 01:47:10,715
Or what he did in the moments
after we believed that he was.

1700
01:47:11,716 --> 01:47:12,800
Consider...

1701
01:47:12,967 --> 01:47:15,345
Madame Doyle reported her husband was
cross with Louise over some nail polish

1702
01:47:15,511 --> 01:47:17,263
left at the hotel.
Why should he care?

1703
01:47:17,430 --> 01:47:19,849
<i>Because Madame Doyle wore
blood red nail polish,</i>

1704
01:47:20,016 --> 01:47:21,809
which had, for him, an intended use.

1705
01:47:21,976 --> 01:47:23,895
This gone,
Madame Bouc's paint would have to do.

1706
01:47:24,062 --> 01:47:26,648
He also did not expect his wife
to invite a detective to the party.

1707
01:47:26,814 --> 01:47:29,776
<i>So, to be safe, he puts me to sleep.
A single glass of champagne</i>

1708
01:47:29,942 --> 01:47:32,612
at his insistence sends me to my bed
with my head spinning.

1709
01:47:32,779 --> 01:47:34,530
Drugged for his performance.

1710
01:47:34,697 --> 01:47:36,407
Miss Otterbourne, you saw a gun fired.

1711
01:47:37,784 --> 01:47:38,785
You saw Simon collapse.

1712
01:47:38,910 --> 01:47:41,621
<i>A blood-soaked handkerchief to his leg.
At which point you left him.</i>

1713
01:47:41,788 --> 01:47:43,414
Busy with Jackie and finding the doctor.

1714
01:47:43,581 --> 01:47:45,166
This gives the murderer but moments alone.

1715
01:47:45,333 --> 01:47:48,211
Moments are all he needs.
He picks up the pistol.

1716
01:47:50,296 --> 01:47:52,173
<i>He runs to his wife's cabin.</i>

1717
01:47:56,010 --> 01:47:57,345
Simon...

1718
01:47:58,304 --> 01:47:59,347
<i>And he shoots her,</i>

1719
01:47:59,430 --> 01:48:00,431
<i>through the temple.</i>

1720
01:48:01,933 --> 01:48:04,060
There were scorch marks
on Linnet Doyle's wounds.

1721
01:48:04,227 --> 01:48:06,020
The missing scarf
would have eliminated them,

1722
01:48:06,104 --> 01:48:07,188
but it was not used on her.

1723
01:48:07,355 --> 01:48:10,274
It was instead used here
to muffle the sound of another shot.

1724
01:48:10,441 --> 01:48:12,110
- What's the matter, Bouc?
- There's been an accident.

1725
01:48:12,276 --> 01:48:13,486
<i>He returns here</i>

1726
01:48:13,653 --> 01:48:16,614
<i>to retrieve the scarf
which he had previously hidden.</i>

1727
01:48:17,240 --> 01:48:20,034
Where he took the gun one more time
and fired it into his own leg.

1728
01:48:23,413 --> 01:48:24,872
After which,
he replaced one bullet

1729
01:48:24,956 --> 01:48:26,332
into the gun so if it was found,

1730
01:48:26,499 --> 01:48:27,625
we could count not three,

1731
01:48:27,709 --> 01:48:29,836
but the two shots
that we believed had been fired.

1732
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:33,297
<i>He then wraps the handkerchief,
the scarf, and the gun</i>

1733
01:48:33,464 --> 01:48:36,259
<i>and throws them
into the waters of the Nile.</i>

1734
01:48:37,343 --> 01:48:39,929
<i>Then makes himself ready
for the arrival of Dr. Windlesham.</i>

1735
01:48:40,096 --> 01:48:41,472
She shot me!

1736
01:48:41,639 --> 01:48:43,516
I can't move my leg.

1737
01:48:44,517 --> 01:48:47,395
Your alibi secured, you avoid suspicion.

1738
01:48:47,478 --> 01:48:49,439
Indeed, you ensured
a multitude of suspects.

1739
01:48:49,605 --> 01:48:51,858
Encouraging a guest list
not merely of friends and family,

1740
01:48:51,941 --> 01:48:54,986
but exclusively those carrying grudge
or grievance against your wife.

1741
01:48:55,153 --> 01:48:56,154
Even our entertainment.

1742
01:48:56,320 --> 01:48:58,573
All passing
as a new husband's thoughtfulness.

1743
01:48:58,740 --> 01:49:01,826
Blame deflected in every direction
except at you.

1744
01:49:04,287 --> 01:49:06,330
You are mad.

1745
01:49:06,914 --> 01:49:12,670
That I would shoot myself,
and then somehow kill Louise and Bouc.

1746
01:49:14,005 --> 01:49:17,133
He's right. He couldn't have killed them.

1747
01:49:17,633 --> 01:49:19,135
He did not kill them.

1748
01:49:19,969 --> 01:49:23,222
The second and third murders
were committed

1749
01:49:23,306 --> 01:49:24,515
by his accomplice in the first,

1750
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:29,979
and, I believe, by the mastermind
behind this entire ingenious plot.

1751
01:49:32,940 --> 01:49:34,442
Jacqueline de Bellefort.

1752
01:49:38,821 --> 01:49:41,157
His lover once. His lover still.

1753
01:49:41,908 --> 01:49:44,952
Introducing the couple. Stalking them.
Finding them aboard this ship.

1754
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:47,288
Shooting Simon with a blank.

1755
01:49:47,455 --> 01:49:50,082
All to create two unassailable alibis.

1756
01:49:50,249 --> 01:49:51,834
The grieving husband
left to inherit his wife's fortune

1757
01:49:52,001 --> 01:49:54,545
and then, in time,
to marry the woman he loves.

1758
01:49:55,463 --> 01:49:57,465
Has always loved.

1759
01:49:58,132 --> 01:50:01,761
When I asked Louise Bourget if she had
seen anything, she gave a curious answer.

1760
01:50:01,928 --> 01:50:05,139
"If I had come outside my cabin,
I might have seen the killer."

1761
01:50:05,306 --> 01:50:09,393
Not yes, not no,
but a veiled threat to Linnet's killer,

1762
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:11,395
<i>who was present in the room.</i>

1763
01:50:11,938 --> 01:50:13,356
Simon Doyle.

1764
01:50:13,523 --> 01:50:16,526
Who then assured her that Louise
would be taken care of.

1765
01:50:16,692 --> 01:50:17,902
<i>Indeed, she was.</i>

1766
01:50:18,069 --> 01:50:21,531
<i>As soon as he was able, Simon,
no doubt, sent a message to Jacqueline,</i>

1767
01:50:21,697 --> 01:50:24,242
<i>warning her of the new danger.</i>

1768
01:50:24,408 --> 01:50:26,410
<i>Telling her where to find a weapon.</i>

1769
01:50:28,412 --> 01:50:29,747
And then, when Bouc...

1770
01:50:43,177 --> 01:50:48,641
When Bouc detected who had killed Louise,
Simon shouted...

1771
01:50:48,808 --> 01:50:49,809
Come on!

1772
01:50:50,393 --> 01:50:54,105
...a warning to his accessory...

1773
01:50:57,692 --> 01:51:00,444
who shot Bouc through the throat.

1774
01:51:02,947 --> 01:51:07,869
<i>Before he could reveal
Jacqueline de Bellefort.</i>

1775
01:51:08,411 --> 01:51:11,330
You killed my son?

1776
01:51:12,582 --> 01:51:13,749
I'll see you die for this.

1777
01:51:13,833 --> 01:51:14,876
Rosie, please.

1778
01:51:15,251 --> 01:51:16,669
I swear it.

1779
01:51:18,045 --> 01:51:19,547
I swear it.

1780
01:51:22,383 --> 01:51:23,968
You can't all believe him.

1781
01:51:25,344 --> 01:51:26,762
He has no proof.

1782
01:51:26,929 --> 01:51:31,183
True. I have only a sunken gun
wiped of fingerprints, yes.

1783
01:51:31,350 --> 01:51:33,185
But it came with a gift.

1784
01:51:33,352 --> 01:51:34,896
The handkerchief.

1785
01:51:35,938 --> 01:51:38,024
The warm waters of the Nile in springtime

1786
01:51:38,107 --> 01:51:40,776
would set the color of blood
to a dull brown.

1787
01:51:41,402 --> 01:51:46,365
In those same mysterious waters,
carmine red paint will fade...

1788
01:51:47,366 --> 01:51:48,951
to pink.

1789
01:52:06,719 --> 01:52:09,096
Oh, how clever is Hercule Poirot.

1790
01:52:10,389 --> 01:52:12,934
Was the ambition his or yours?

1791
01:52:21,734 --> 01:52:23,277
He needed things.

1792
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:28,741
I needed him.

1793
01:52:29,325 --> 01:52:31,285
You never cared for money.

1794
01:52:31,452 --> 01:52:32,453
But you could deny him nothing.

1795
01:52:32,620 --> 01:52:35,998
Not even a plan
when he could not devise his own.

1796
01:52:43,005 --> 01:52:44,090
Simon, what do we do?

1797
01:52:44,256 --> 01:52:45,299
Let's go.

1798
01:52:45,466 --> 01:52:46,550
They'll take us in.
We'll be separated.

1799
01:52:46,717 --> 01:52:48,803
We get off the boat now and we run.

1800
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:50,346
Come on.

1801
01:52:51,806 --> 01:52:54,225
It's all right, Simon.
Give it to me.

1802
01:52:55,476 --> 01:52:56,560
Uh-uh.

1803
01:53:02,775 --> 01:53:05,319
Listen to me.

1804
01:53:05,486 --> 01:53:06,529
We can make it.

1805
01:53:06,696 --> 01:53:09,407
We've got to go now,
and we've got to be strong.

1806
01:53:10,491 --> 01:53:11,867
We can be strong.

1807
01:53:12,326 --> 01:53:13,661
We can be strong.

1808
01:53:38,602 --> 01:53:40,855
I love you.

1809
01:54:47,421 --> 01:54:49,840
I am sorry you have become so wealthy.

1810
01:54:49,924 --> 01:54:51,509
Ah, nothing I can't fix.

1811
01:54:51,675 --> 01:54:53,427
We might just keep some.

1812
01:54:54,095 --> 01:54:55,096
Come on.

1813
01:54:58,933 --> 01:55:00,643
They will arrest me now?

1814
01:55:01,185 --> 01:55:02,186
No.

1815
01:55:03,562 --> 01:55:06,107
So long as you settle her affairs honestly

1816
01:55:06,732 --> 01:55:08,859
and pay back what you owe.

1817
01:55:17,535 --> 01:55:19,078
You return to London, Doctor?

1818
01:55:19,495 --> 01:55:21,956
There's nothing for me in London anymore.

1819
01:55:22,665 --> 01:55:24,083
West Africa.

1820
01:55:24,250 --> 01:55:25,876
Perhaps I can do some good there.

1821
01:56:05,249 --> 01:56:07,585
I wish I'd never got to see you work.

1822
01:56:14,300 --> 01:56:15,509
Um...

1823
01:56:18,220 --> 01:56:19,513
Perhaps...

1824
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:14,652
- See you soon, Syd.
- Thanks a lot for tonight.

1825
01:57:14,818 --> 01:57:15,903
See you in a couple days.

1826
01:57:17,154 --> 01:57:19,990
Tell the band one more song,
then they have to finish their rehearsal.

1827
01:57:21,200 --> 01:57:22,201
Watch it, mister.

1828
01:57:29,208 --> 01:57:31,877
<i>When the storm</i>

1829
01:57:38,133 --> 01:57:43,264
<i>Of life is raging</i>

1830
01:57:47,017 --> 01:57:50,396
<i>Stand by me</i>

1831
01:57:59,446 --> 01:58:04,743
<i>When the storm</i>

1832
01:58:04,910 --> 01:58:06,328
We're closed, mate.

1833
01:58:07,454 --> 01:58:11,750
<i>Of life is raging</i>

1834
01:58:16,380 --> 01:58:20,342
<i>Stand by me</i>

1835
01:58:25,222 --> 01:58:29,393
<i>When this world</i>

1836
01:58:32,980 --> 01:58:36,233
<i>Is tossing me</i>

1837
01:58:39,903 --> 01:58:41,822
<i>Whoa</i>

1838
01:58:42,031 --> 01:58:46,827
<i>- Hey, hey, hey, hey
- Like a ship</i>

1839
01:58:46,994 --> 01:58:48,662
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1840
01:58:48,871 --> 01:58:53,208
<i>Out on the sea</i>

1841
01:58:58,172 --> 01:59:01,925
<i>Stand</i>

1842
01:59:02,092 --> 01:59:07,139
<i>By me</i>
