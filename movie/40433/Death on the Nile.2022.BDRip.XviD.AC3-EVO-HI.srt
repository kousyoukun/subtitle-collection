a week before opening

You can ruin his life or begin a new one.

It may not be the life that you imagined,

but perhaps it will be the life
that God intended.

975

Love is far too important to trust to God.

From the moment I met Simon,
I knew one thing for absolute certain,

977
00:57:21,397 --> 00:57:23,774
I will die if we are parted.

I should die.

How?

1130
01:06:10,801 --> 01:06:14,346
I'm afraid Jacqueline de Bellefort
has made good on her threat.

1131

No, that's impossible.

even for a moment?

01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:24,606
Did you leave her side or sleep at all?

1136
01:06:24,773 --> 01:06:26,942
No, not a minute. No. Not a wink.

1137

And even if I had,
I was scared she might hurt herself,

1138
01:06:29,862 --> 01:06:32,906

to fell an elephant.

to pick up the gun and lock it away.

we couldn't find it.

Simon was with the doctor
and Jackie was with the nurse.

1153

I just figured it was
an awful lovers' quarrel

in the moments between you bringing
Mr. Doyle to the doctor and your return,

01:13:41,167 --> 01:13:45,797
Much of the world lacks access to modern
medicine we take for granted, Poirot.

1272
01:13:45,964 --> 01:13:49,134
Most nobility enjoy their nobility more.

1273
01:13:49,301 --> 01:13:51,511
Linnet used to tease me for that.

1274
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:55,765
Said I shouldn't expect her to honeymoon
in a mud hut.

1275
01:13:59,436 --> 01:14:02,522
Your thoughts to her were always tender.
What of the husband?

1276
01:14:03,064 --> 01:14:04,649
I don't know him well.

1277
01:14:05,317 --> 01:14:06,735
What I do know, I can't recommend.

1278
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,111
This is appropriate.

1279
01:14:08,194 --> 01:14:10,530
Mr. Doyle would have us
focus our suspicions on you.

1280
01:14:10,614 --> 01:14:11,656
WINDLESHAM: Me?

1281
01:14:12,157 --> 01:14:13,700
I was with him all last night.

1282
01:14:13,867 --> 01:14:15,744
POIROT: Indeed. You gave him
a strong opiate injection.

1283
01:14:15,827 --> 01:14:16,828
He was asleep.

1284
01:14:16,911 --> 01:14:19,456
You could have left him at any time
and not been observed.

1285
01:14:19,914 --> 01:14:21,750
- Did he ask for the drug?
- He was in pain.

1286
01:14:21,916 --> 01:14:24,961
There are less powerful pain medications
in your bag which would suffice.

1287
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:27,047
You created for yourself an opportunity.

1288
01:14:27,213 --> 01:14:29,716
- I didn't create an opportunity.
- POIROT: She was unkind, no?

1289
01:14:29,799 --> 01:14:32,552
She flaunted her new love,
yet still called you like the puppy dog.

1290
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:33,887
Seeing them pained you,

1291
01:14:34,054 --> 01:14:37,057
and like the strong opiate injection,
you could end your pain with a bullet.

1292
01:14:37,223 --> 01:14:38,725
Lords demand to get what they want,

1293
01:14:38,808 --> 01:14:39,851
and you are still a lord.

1294
01:14:39,934 --> 01:14:41,478
(SHOUTING)
What do you want me to say?

1295
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:43,229
What do you want me to say?

1296
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:44,939
That I know I'm ridiculous?

1297
01:14:49,069 --> 01:14:50,487
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

1298
01:14:52,656 --> 01:14:54,032
I'm not a fool.

1299
01:14:54,991 --> 01:14:57,994
I knew she was settling for me.

1300
01:14:58,912 --> 01:15:00,246
I didn't mind.

1301
01:15:03,124 --> 01:15:04,918
When she married Simon,

1302
01:15:05,669 --> 01:15:08,505
I actually thought
about ending my own life.

1303
01:15:10,173 --> 01:15:12,801
They all thought our engagement
was for the families,

1304
01:15:12,967 --> 01:15:16,179
the papers, for the damn aristocratic
theatrics of it all.

1305
01:15:19,140 --> 01:15:20,892
The shame of it is...

1306
01:15:23,019 --> 01:15:24,437
I loved her.

1307
01:15:28,983 --> 01:15:31,695
POIROT:
Little Linny and cousin Andrew.

1308
01:15:32,362 --> 01:15:35,198
ANDREW: I knew her
since we were children.

1309
01:15:35,615 --> 01:15:37,951
Were you aware of any grudges
against the family?

1310
01:15:38,118 --> 01:15:39,703
More than many.

1311
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:42,163
Her father got rich
making rich people poor.

1312
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:44,040
Linny continued the practice.

1313
01:15:44,207 --> 01:15:45,959
Did you hear anything
of the commotion last night?

1314
01:15:46,126 --> 01:15:47,293
I was all snores by 11:00.

1315
01:15:47,460 --> 01:15:49,963
And the contracts you wished her to sign,
they are very important?

1316
01:15:50,380 --> 01:15:52,716
Yes. They are. Were.

1317
01:15:53,383 --> 01:15:56,094
With Linny gone, the, uh,
estate will have to be redrawn.

1318
01:15:56,177 --> 01:15:57,178
May I see them?

1319
01:15:57,262 --> 01:15:59,389
Forgive me. These are confidential.

1320
01:16:00,432 --> 01:16:01,975
I must insist.

1321
01:16:02,142 --> 01:16:03,935
- Respect for the deceased.
- No matter, I know what they contain.

1322
01:16:04,102 --> 01:16:05,103
I doubt that very much.

1323
01:16:05,228 --> 01:16:08,648
I believe they extend your stewardship
of Madam Doyle's estate,

1324
01:16:08,815 --> 01:16:10,316
despite her marriage, no?

1325
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,526
(SCOFFS) Who told you?

1326
01:16:11,693 --> 01:16:13,486
I am Hercule Poirot.

1327
01:16:13,653 --> 01:16:15,572
I do not need to be told.
I have eyes and they see.

1328
01:16:15,655 --> 01:16:18,366
A brain and it thinks.
It now thinks somewhat poorly of you.

1329
01:16:21,077 --> 01:16:23,163
- You think I killed her?
- Did you kill her?

1330
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,291
I don't benefit a dime
from her death, Mr. Poirot.

1331
01:16:26,458 --> 01:16:28,042
You can look at the will I revised.

1332
01:16:28,209 --> 01:16:30,336
A godmother stands to inherit.

1333
01:16:30,503 --> 01:16:32,797
Her husband legally gets the rest.

1334
01:16:32,964 --> 01:16:34,591
You won't see my name anywhere.

1335
01:16:34,758 --> 01:16:39,095
Perhaps the intention was not to inherit,
but to conceal.

1336
01:16:39,345 --> 01:16:42,724
You executed control
over her vast fortune.

1337
01:16:42,891 --> 01:16:45,894
Not a concern, so long as
there is no impropriety,

1338
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:49,898
no speculation by loyal cousin Andrew,

1339
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:51,858
in a time of market decline.

1340
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:54,027
This is not a kind of thing
you can prove on a boat.

1341
01:16:54,194 --> 01:16:57,489
You endeavored to obtain a signature

1342
01:16:57,655 --> 01:17:02,202
by trickery, from Little Linny,
and you failed.

1343
01:17:03,328 --> 01:17:05,121
You knew it was only a matter of time

1344
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:08,583
before her keen eyes
uncovered your thievery,

1345
01:17:08,750 --> 01:17:12,629
unless her eyes were closed forever.

1346
01:17:15,256 --> 01:17:19,177
You see, in my position, Mr. Poirot,

1347
01:17:19,344 --> 01:17:23,640
I often have to transport items
such as canvases worth millions.

1348
01:17:23,807 --> 01:17:26,017
And they need security.

1349
01:17:26,184 --> 01:17:28,645
So, if I wanted to Kill her,

1350
01:17:28,812 --> 01:17:30,605
I would have used this.

1351
01:17:35,276 --> 01:17:36,903
A .45.

1352
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,279
Yes.

1353
01:17:38,446 --> 01:17:39,489
You may go.

1354
01:17:46,621 --> 01:17:47,872
BOUC: A .45.

1355
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:49,999
Why would he risk going back
for Jackie's gun if he had that?

1356
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,292
POIROT: He would not.

1357
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:55,171
Miss Bowers, if I might trouble you.

1358
01:17:55,338 --> 01:17:58,508
He wants to speak with me?
I'm laying down a corner.

1359
01:17:58,591 --> 01:18:00,760
There's nothing to fear.
Only you might know something of value.

1360
01:18:00,844 --> 01:18:02,554
That would be the shocking twist.

1361
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,180
If you wouldn't mind her coming alone.

1362
01:18:04,347 --> 01:18:06,224
I damn well would.

When you kept vigil with
Mademoiselle de Bellefort,

1367
01:18:16,025 --> 01:18:19,362
did she make threats against Linnet Doyle?

1368
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:21,406
No, her threats were against herself.

1369
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,617
She wanted to pitch herself
into the drink and not come up.

1370
01:18:24,784 --> 01:18:26,661
That's why I gave her all the morphia.

How fortunate that we had you with us.

Um... Well, coming on 10 years.

and here, you moon over truffle
and king crabs.

So, too, your gown, Chanel,

your luggage, Vuitton,
your shoes, Perugia.

you had caviar, did you say?

Many lost fortunes in the crash.

1386
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:17,754
Many of them due to Papa Ridge way
and his unscrupulous business practices.

of this interrogation.

Well, I don't care for it. Or for you.

that you are a key beneficiary
in Linnet Doyle's will.

01:21:14,454 --> 01:21:16,372
I don't give a fig for money.

1427
01:21:17,123 --> 01:21:19,834
I see no reason to continue
this conversation. Come on, Bowers.

1428
01:21:20,001 --> 01:21:23,337
The stewards on this ship keep
an excellent room. Have you noticed?

1429
01:21:23,546 --> 01:21:27,008
A truly first-rate housekeeping staff.

1430
01:21:27,175 --> 01:21:28,384
He's off his rails.

1431
01:21:28,551 --> 01:21:29,719
Beds made every day,

1432
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:33,848
sheets folded in marvelously precise
45-degree hospital corners, I must say.

1433
01:21:34,015 --> 01:21:37,101
Unlike, for example, the day we departed,

1434
01:21:37,268 --> 01:21:42,940
when the beds were made
in the flowing edged bedspread style.

1435
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:45,943
But, you know, when I saw
Mademoiselle de Bellefort

1436
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:49,655
asleep in Miss Bowers' room
on our third day aboard,

1437
01:21:50,281 --> 01:21:54,452
<i>the bed was as it had been on our first.</i>

1438
01:21:54,619 --> 01:21:57,205
As yet unslept in.

1439
01:21:58,456 --> 01:21:59,749
Bouc,

1440
01:21:59,916 --> 01:22:03,711
where did you find Miss Bowers
when you sought her aid?

1441
01:22:03,878 --> 01:22:05,922
In Mrs. Van Schuyler's room.

1442
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:09,300
My mind asks...

1443
01:22:10,134 --> 01:22:15,223
Here is a woman for whom the fire against
class and materialism burns so hot

1444
01:22:15,389 --> 01:22:17,683
and yet she keeps a servant?

1445
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,560
No.

1446
01:22:21,354 --> 01:22:23,147
Her servant is no servant...

1447
01:22:24,315 --> 01:22:27,652
nor nurse, only companion.

1448
01:22:28,528 --> 01:22:30,488
Let us name the reason.

1449
01:22:30,655 --> 01:22:31,823
Love.

1450
01:22:34,951 --> 01:22:36,285
(SHAKILY) Don't worry.

1451
01:22:38,663 --> 01:22:39,831
POIROT: And I know this.

1452
01:22:39,997 --> 01:22:41,457
It's all right.

1453
01:22:42,125 --> 01:22:46,879
People kill for love.

1454
01:22:47,046 --> 01:22:48,214
MAN: (IN DISTANCE)
They found something!

- (DISTANT WHISTLE BLOWING)
- (PEOPLE CLAMORING)

1456
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:51,134
BOWERS: What?

1457
01:22:51,217 --> 01:22:53,136
MAN: They found something!

1458
01:22:53,553 --> 01:22:54,804
Monsieur Poirot.

1459
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58,432
CAPTAIN MAHMOUD: Well done, young man.
Go and get yourself cleaned up.

1460
01:22:58,516 --> 01:22:59,517
MAN 2: Yes, sir.

1461
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,726
BOWERS: It's your scarf.

1462
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:04,188
But it went missing.
I've been looking for it since the temple.

1463
01:23:04,355 --> 01:23:06,649
BOWERS: It's true.
We couldn't find it anywhere.

1464
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:14,365
POIROT: It has had
an adventure in your absence.

1465
01:23:14,532 --> 01:23:17,493
Your scarf, complete with bullet holes...

1466
01:23:20,246 --> 01:23:22,290
Used to dampen the noise of a shot.

1467
01:23:22,456 --> 01:23:23,875
POIROT: Also a bloodied handkerchief

1468
01:23:24,041 --> 01:23:27,587
and the .22 derringer
belonging to Jacqueline de Bellefort.

1469
01:23:29,422 --> 01:23:30,965
- Two bullets fired.
- (BELL DINGING)

1470
01:23:31,048 --> 01:23:33,718
CAPTAIN MAHMOUD:
<i>We return immediately to Assouan.</i>

(SHIP HORN BLOWING)

1472
01:23:37,680 --> 01:23:39,265
Ooh, I like this.

1473
01:23:39,432 --> 01:23:42,018
The full force of his forceful attention.

1474
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:44,520
The great mind, all mine.

1475
01:23:44,937 --> 01:23:47,231
Flirtation, however delightful,
will have no effect.

1476
01:23:47,940 --> 01:23:50,067
A woman shows you a direct bit of interest

1477
01:23:50,234 --> 01:23:52,445
and you assume
it can only be to hide guilt.

1478
01:23:52,904 --> 01:23:54,113
(CHUCKLES)

1479
01:23:54,197 --> 01:23:56,991
Whoever she was
must've done a number on you.

1480
01:23:57,158 --> 01:24:00,745
That mask covers your whole face,
doesn't it?

1481
01:24:04,498 --> 01:24:07,251
You knew Linnet Doyle before you came
to entertain us, yes?

1482
01:24:07,418 --> 01:24:09,420
- Paths crossed.
- You did not like her?

1483
01:24:09,503 --> 01:24:10,504
I stay polite.

1484
01:24:10,588 --> 01:24:14,133
Monsieur Doyle mentioned an incident
with the victim long ago.

1485
01:24:14,425 --> 01:24:17,220
A reason for possible animosity.

1486
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:21,682
Poolside, Kennebunkport.

1487
01:24:21,849 --> 01:24:24,518
Summer of '24, before I was someone.

1488
01:24:24,685 --> 01:24:26,354
I played a show at the hotel

1489
01:24:26,437 --> 01:24:29,565
and thought to take Rosie
for a swim before packing.

1490
01:24:30,191 --> 01:24:32,360
A young girl complained to her papa

1491
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:34,820
about having to share the pool
with a colored.

1492
01:24:34,987 --> 01:24:38,115
We were told to leave,
and when I did not abide,

1493
01:24:38,199 --> 01:24:39,700
I was made to.

1494
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:44,372
I wasn't sure she'd even remember it.
I do.

1495
01:24:44,538 --> 01:24:45,706
It was '25.

1496
01:24:47,291 --> 01:24:48,626
So does she.

1497
01:24:50,169 --> 01:24:51,170
Mademoiselle.

1498
01:24:53,839 --> 01:24:56,050
She shamed you in front of your ward.

1499
01:24:56,217 --> 01:24:57,218
SALOME: Monsieur Poirot,

1500
01:24:57,385 --> 01:24:59,929
if I put a bullet in everyone
who took a potshot at me

1501
01:25:00,096 --> 01:25:01,889
for not keeping to my place,

1502
01:25:02,056 --> 01:25:05,434
the world would be littered
with dead white ladies.

1503
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,728
ROSALIE: Linnet was just a kid back then.

1504
01:25:09,021 --> 01:25:10,856
Taught by a bad daddy.

1505
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,859
But she became my friend
in boarding school.

1506
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,988
Gave the other girls license
to do the same.

1507
01:25:18,322 --> 01:25:19,573
Truth to tell...

1508
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:23,577
Linnet was as easy to hate as love.

1509
01:25:24,996 --> 01:25:26,497
I might have done both.

1510
01:25:27,790 --> 01:25:29,875
That is a very honest reply.

1511
01:25:31,127 --> 01:25:32,878
I thank you both for your time, mesdames.

1512
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:36,173
There was one final question.
It is a curiosity of mine.

1513
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:38,843
Your hat. (CHUCKLING)
In the turban style.

1514
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:41,637
As many times as I have seen you,
you have always worn one like I,

1515
01:25:41,804 --> 01:25:43,097
but it is out of the fashion, no?

1516
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:45,933
Not when I wear it.

1517
01:25:46,684 --> 01:25:51,105
If you would indulge me,
please, to remove it.

1518
01:25:51,188 --> 01:25:53,858
- ROSALIE: Mm-mm.
- Oh! It's all right, Rosie.

1519
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:56,819
He's driving at an answer
he already knows.

1520
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:06,537
.22 caliber, like the one
that killed Linnet Doyle.

1521
01:26:06,704 --> 01:26:08,664
I've used it, if you wanna ask.

1522
01:26:08,831 --> 01:26:11,375
Twice in defense, once in anger.

1523
01:26:11,542 --> 01:26:13,919
Last night was not that once.

1524
01:26:14,337 --> 01:26:15,796
You tell me if I'm lying.

1525
01:26:15,963 --> 01:26:17,506
Mr. Poirot.

1526
01:26:17,715 --> 01:26:18,716
Monsieur.

1527
01:26:18,799 --> 01:26:20,468
You interrupt at a poor time, madame.

1528
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:21,844
You're meant to be the detective,

1529
01:26:22,011 --> 01:26:25,014
yet I found this.

1530
01:26:28,351 --> 01:26:31,687
It was there,
right in my vanity drawer,

1531
01:26:31,854 --> 01:26:33,606
face up like a yolk.

1532
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:37,735
You know I didn't take it.

1533
01:26:37,902 --> 01:26:39,737
No. Which is why
our killer has remanded it

1534
01:26:39,820 --> 01:26:41,030
to your custody to return.

1535
01:26:41,197 --> 01:26:42,239
BOUC: Thank you.
POIROT: Unless...

1536
01:26:42,406 --> 01:26:43,616
BOUC: Poirot.
EUPHEMIA: Unless what?

1537
01:26:43,783 --> 01:26:46,827
Unless you took the necklace
to steer suspicion away from you.

1538
01:26:46,952 --> 01:26:49,705
Evidence is easily disposed of
over the ship's railing.

1539
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:53,376
Whoever did this made a show of discovery.

1540
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,294
Why would my mother murder Linnet?

1541
01:26:55,461 --> 01:26:58,172
POIROT: Bouc, you said your mother was
furious with Linnet for making you a pair.

1542
01:26:58,339 --> 01:27:00,549
Madame, it was Linnet Doyle
who introduced your son

1543
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:03,052
- to a woman you distrust, no?
- (SCOFFS) Rest assured,

1544
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:06,305
if I had a bullet in my pocket
to correct my son's poor taste,

1545
01:27:06,472 --> 01:27:08,140
I would not spend it on Mrs. Doyle.

1546
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:09,683
Mother, please, that is not helping.

1547
01:27:09,850 --> 01:27:12,269
Perhaps. But I have seen
your excellent landscapes.

1548
01:27:12,436 --> 01:27:16,315
You are a patient woman who achieves
every effect she intends in time.

1549
01:27:16,482 --> 01:27:20,444
Who so diligently planned
to have me aboard this ship,

1550
01:27:20,611 --> 01:27:25,199
yet with my suspicions
diverted in another direction.

1551
01:27:25,366 --> 01:27:26,534
That is a private affair.

1552
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,285
That is a concluded affair, madame.

1553
01:27:28,452 --> 01:27:30,287
- Enough.
- Enough indeed.

1554
01:27:30,454 --> 01:27:32,456
I am now prepared
to present the conclusions

1555
01:27:32,623 --> 01:27:35,876
of my other, more secret case
and put it to rest.

1556
01:27:36,293 --> 01:27:37,795
Secret case?
What?

1557
01:27:38,671 --> 01:27:39,880
What does he mean?

1558
01:27:39,964 --> 01:27:41,507
- (INHALES SHARPLY)
- Mother?

1559
01:27:45,636 --> 01:27:47,471
- Monsieur.
- Mademoiselle.

1560
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:54,353
Mesdames, thank you for joining us.

1561
01:27:54,520 --> 01:27:55,729
Bouc.

1562
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,983
I will make my own confession.

1563
01:27:59,567 --> 01:28:03,195
When we met in Giza, I told you
I was on vacation from my detective work

1564
01:28:03,362 --> 01:28:07,575
when in fact,
I was and have been on a case.

1565
01:28:07,741 --> 01:28:08,951
- What case?
- (EUPHEMIA SIGHS)

1566
01:28:09,785 --> 01:28:10,786
You.

1567
01:28:11,454 --> 01:28:13,330
At the request of your mother,
Madame Bouc,

1568
01:28:13,414 --> 01:28:16,041
who cabled me in distress
some weeks ago.

1569
01:28:16,208 --> 01:28:17,877
My mother, in distress?

1570
01:28:18,043 --> 01:28:19,545
I was bidden to follow the Otterbournes

1571
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:23,382
to determine the character and fitness
of the show business woman

1572
01:28:23,549 --> 01:28:24,717
who had stolen your heart.

1573
01:28:25,968 --> 01:28:26,969
You did this to me?

1574
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,929
I'm your mother. I've done far worse.

1575
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:30,181
POIROT: To observe them,

1576
01:28:30,347 --> 01:28:33,058
I had to consume many doses
of the bluesy music,

1577
01:28:33,225 --> 01:28:35,478
which, I confess,
I did not expect to enjoy,

1578
01:28:35,561 --> 01:28:36,896
but, in fact, I did very much

1579
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,397
as performed by Madame Otterbourne.

1580
01:28:38,481 --> 01:28:40,983
It was unusual for me,
but it was very nice.

1581
01:28:41,150 --> 01:28:42,693
That's why you were in Giza.

1582
01:28:42,860 --> 01:28:44,820
How we met "accidentally."

1583
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:45,988
I am sorry.

1584
01:28:46,155 --> 01:28:47,823
I had to make you see what she is.

1585
01:28:47,990 --> 01:28:49,200
Tell him, Detective.

1586
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:50,993
I will tell you, Bouc.

1587
01:28:53,454 --> 01:28:55,122
Having observed Rosalie Otterbourne,

1588
01:28:55,289 --> 01:28:56,999
having inspected
her books of accounting...

1589
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:59,168
<i>Yes, I know, please forgive me, madame.</i>

1590
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:00,336
What?

1591
01:29:00,503 --> 01:29:02,421
POIROT: ...I can tell you,
she gambles frequently,

1592
01:29:02,505 --> 01:29:04,006
though frequently wins.

1593
01:29:04,173 --> 01:29:07,551
She drinks little, she tips well,
she pays her employees,

1594
01:29:07,718 --> 01:29:10,763
and her taxes on time to the dime.

1595
01:29:10,930 --> 01:29:13,599
She is diligent, she is forthright.

1596
01:29:13,766 --> 01:29:16,143
In business, perhaps even virtuosic.

1597
01:29:16,310 --> 01:29:18,062
Though at piano, sadly, amateur.

1598
01:29:18,145 --> 01:29:19,230
(SCOFFS)

1599
01:29:19,939 --> 01:29:23,025
As for her adopted mother,
she drinks to excess twice a week or more.

1600
01:29:23,192 --> 01:29:26,111
She smokes cigarettes
of various compositions.

1601
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:28,656
And I believe that at least two
of her marriages were not...

1602
01:29:28,739 --> 01:29:30,157
I think, strictly legally ended.

1603
01:29:30,324 --> 01:29:33,536
But she is a magnificent personality.

1604
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:34,912
SALOME: Mm.

1605
01:29:34,995 --> 01:29:38,541
I do not yet know
who murdered Linnet Doyle.

1606
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:41,001
But I do know this...

1607
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:45,923
Rosalie Otterbourne is irrevocably in love
with your son and is his better in virtue.

1608
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:48,842
She is more than fit.
She is a find.

1609
01:29:52,888 --> 01:29:54,807
It wasn't enough that we're happy.

1610
01:29:54,974 --> 01:29:58,811
I did not trust her.
Despite the detective, I still don't.

1611
01:29:58,978 --> 01:30:01,564
I love her.
That has to count for something.

1612
01:30:01,730 --> 01:30:02,815
Why should it?

1613
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:05,234
Corinthians had it wrong on every point.

1614
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:06,902
Love isn't patient or kind.

1615
01:30:07,069 --> 01:30:09,822
It envies and boasts and doesn't care
who gets mowed down.

1616
01:30:09,989 --> 01:30:12,324
It angers, it is irritable,
it keeps record

1617
01:30:12,408 --> 01:30:13,742
of every transgression against it,

1618
01:30:13,909 --> 01:30:15,869
and good God, it fails.

1619
01:30:16,036 --> 01:30:18,706
Sure as a face ages, love fails.

1620
01:30:18,872 --> 01:30:21,834
He really wants your permission,
but he doesn't need it.

1621
01:30:22,334 --> 01:30:24,587
Any more than I need
to meet your standard.

1622
01:30:24,753 --> 01:30:26,005
Or yours.

1623
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:28,966
I've had a chance to observe you.

1624
01:30:30,968 --> 01:30:32,928
Wanna know what I make of your character?

1625
01:30:34,805 --> 01:30:39,602
He is obsessive,
IS vain, is smug,

1626
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,062
is lonely for a reason.

1627
01:30:42,229 --> 01:30:46,025
A detestable, tiresome, bombastic,

1628
01:30:46,191 --> 01:30:48,152
egocentric little freak.

1629
01:30:49,987 --> 01:30:51,447
How dare you?

1630
01:30:53,407 --> 01:30:54,742
Get out of my way.

1631
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:56,410
- Mademoiselle, if I may.
- SALOME: Ooh.

1632
01:30:57,328 --> 01:30:59,830
Miss Otterbourne,
I owe you an explanation.

1633
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,417
Please. Allow me to apologize.

1634
01:31:03,584 --> 01:31:04,752
Have you ever met a man

1635
01:31:04,835 --> 01:31:06,670
who says his own name
as many times

1636
01:31:06,754 --> 01:31:07,963
- as Hercule Poirot...
- (THUD)

POIROT: <i>Confirmed.</i>

1639
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,864
<i>It is Louise Bourget.</i>

1640
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:35,783
WINDLESHAM:
There's no sign of drowning.

1641
01:31:35,949 --> 01:31:37,284
They threw the body in after.

1642
01:31:37,451 --> 01:31:39,828
She must have got caught up in the paddle.

1643
01:31:40,663 --> 01:31:42,247
She was murdered on board.

1644
01:31:42,706 --> 01:31:44,541
Within the last hour.

1645
01:31:47,211 --> 01:31:48,337
Money.

1646
01:31:49,171 --> 01:31:50,589
Covered in blood.

1647
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:55,260
Louise Bourget hinted that

1648
01:31:55,427 --> 01:31:59,431
she might have seen
the killer make an escape.

1649
01:32:00,766 --> 01:32:06,563
If indeed she had, she might have
offered her silence for a sum of money.

1650
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:08,399
A blackmail.

1651
01:32:10,567 --> 01:32:13,696
Only the killer preferred
her silence absolute.

1652
01:32:15,781 --> 01:32:18,283
Her throat, cut clean. The blade...

1653
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:21,245
short.

1654
01:32:21,954 --> 01:32:24,623
Very sharp. Like a...

1655
01:32:27,626 --> 01:32:28,794
Like a scalpel.

1656
01:32:33,090 --> 01:32:34,091
You!

1657
01:32:34,633 --> 01:32:35,718
You killed them!

1658
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,679
It was... It was his scalpel!

1659
01:32:39,388 --> 01:32:41,181
He killed Louise!

1660
01:32:41,348 --> 01:32:43,225
And she saw him leaving Linny's cabin.

1661
01:32:44,017 --> 01:32:46,103
You've been lying ever since.

1662
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:49,022
You're the one
Linnet should never have trusted.

1663
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:52,443
I always told her your firm
was bilking her for millions.

1664

He's trying.

Well, he'd better try harder,

1677

or we'll all wind up
in an Egyptian jail cell.

No.

1680
01:34:08,143 --> 01:34:09,812
He loved Linnet too much.

1681
01:34:10,521 --> 01:34:11,772
There's your motive right there.

1682

Look, all of you just keep quiet
and let Poirot work.

In any case,
we'll reach the port by morning.

For now, it's safest if we
just keep to our own cabins

I'll have to write

1688
01:34:54,314 --> 01:34:56,984
and let him know that she's...
gone.

1689

I must ask you to remain
as witness to this interview.

We weren't close, just familiar.

My parents considered her parents
their equals,

1708

SO we grew up at the same parties
and wound up kissing each other's friends.

You can't catch me at anything
because I haven't done anything.

POIROT: Her husband was shot.

1717
01:36:44,633 --> 01:36:46,468
You have such sympathy

of Louise Bourget.

1719

You wish to inform him of her fate.

Yet, you do not spare
the same sympathy for Linnet.

I thought she would be asleep.

1722
01:36:53,684 --> 01:36:55,811
She said that she had taken
a sleeping pill.

- BOUC: No, I didn't.

1732
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:26,842
You returned to the parlor alone,
to find the gun and you did.

1733
01:37:27,009 --> 01:37:30,178
You then went to the Doyles' cabin
to inform Linnet about Simon.

1734
01:37:30,804 --> 01:37:33,849
She was sleeping. You saw the necklace.
You were assaulted by temptation.

But she woke, catching you,
so you shot her.

Linnet Doyle's murder was premeditated.

1746
01:38:01,168 --> 01:38:03,462
It required exact timing, a stolen scarf.

1747

You did not kill her, but
you did go to the Doyles' cabin

01:38:07,758 --> 01:38:10,677
and found Linnet already dead.

But instead of calling for help...

you took the necklace.

01:38:25,025 --> 01:38:27,819
After I told you of the cabin search,
you attempted to return it.

1753
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:32,699
But you came upon Louise Bourget
arguing with someone, demanding money.

1754
01:38:32,866 --> 01:38:34,659
You saw her throat cut.

Believing that she would catch no blame.

Or what he did in the moments
after we believed that he was.

1898
01:47:51,716 --> 01:47:52,800
Consider...

1899
01:47:52,967 --> 01:47:55,345
Madame Doyle reported her husband was
cross with Louise over some nail polish

1900
01:47:55,511 --> 01:47:57,263
left at the hotel.
Why should he care?

1901
01:47:57,430 --> 01:47:59,849
<i>Because Madame Doyle wore
blood red nail polish,</i>

1902
01:48:00,016 --> 01:48:01,809
which had, for him, an intended use.

1903
01:48:01,976 --> 01:48:03,895
This gone,
Madame Bouc's paint would have to do.

1904
01:48:04,062 --> 01:48:06,648
He also did not expect his wife
to invite a detective to the party.

1905
01:48:06,814 --> 01:48:09,776
<i>So, to be safe, he puts me to sleep.
A single glass of champagne</i>

1906
01:48:09,942 --> 01:48:12,612
at his insistence sends me to my bed
with my head spinning.

1907
01:48:12,779 --> 01:48:14,530
Drugged for his performance.

1908
01:48:14,697 --> 01:48:16,407
Miss Otterbourne, you saw a gun fired.

1909
01:48:17,784 --> 01:48:18,785
You saw Simon collapse.

1910
01:48:18,910 --> 01:48:21,621
<i>A blood-soaked handkerchief to his leg.
At which point you left him.</i>

1911
01:48:21,788 --> 01:48:23,414
Busy with Jackie and finding the doctor.

1912
01:48:23,581 --> 01:48:25,166
This gives the murderer but moments alone.

1913
01:48:25,333 --> 01:48:28,211
Moments are all he needs.
He picks up the pistol.

1914
01:48:30,296 --> 01:48:32,173
<i>He runs to his wife's cabin.</i>

1915
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:37,345

- POIROT: <i>And he shoots her,</i>

<i>through the temple.</i>

1918
01:48:41,933 --> 01:48:44,060
There were scorch marks
on Linnet Doyle's wounds.

1919
01:48:44,227 --> 01:48:46,020
The missing scarf
would have eliminated them,

1920
01:48:46,104 --> 01:48:47,188
but it was not used on her.

1921
01:48:47,355 --> 01:48:50,274
It was instead used here
to muffle the sound of another shot.

1922
01:48:50,441 --> 01:48:52,110
- What's the matter, Bouc?
- There's been an accident.

1923
01:48:52,276 --> 01:48:53,486
POIROT: <i>He returns here</i>

1924
01:48:53,653 --> 01:48:56,614
<i>to retrieve the scarf
which he had previously hidden.</i>

1925
01:48:57,240 --> 01:49:00,034
Where he took the gun one more time
and fired it into his own leg.

1926
01:49:00,118 --> 01:49:01,327
- (MUFFLED GUNSHOT)
- (GROANS)

1927
01:49:03,413 --> 01:49:04,872
POIROT: After which,
he replaced one bullet

1928
01:49:04,956 --> 01:49:06,332
into the gun so if it was found,

1929
01:49:06,499 --> 01:49:07,625
we could count not three,

1930
01:49:07,709 --> 01:49:09,836
but the two shots
that we believed had been fired.

1931
01:49:10,336 --> 01:49:13,297
<i>He then wraps the handkerchief,
the scarf, and the gun</i>

<i>and throws them
into the waters of the Nile.</i>

<i>Then makes himself ready
for the arrival of Dr. Windlesham.</i>

I can't move my leg. (GROANS)

Your alibi secured, you avoid suspicion.

1937

Indeed, you ensured
a multitude of suspects.

1938
01:49:29,605 --> 01:49:31,858
Encouraging a guest list
not merely of friends and family,

or grievance against your wife.

All passing
as a new husband's thoughtfulness.

Blame deflected in every direction
except at you.

1943

You are mad.

1944
01:49:46,914 --> 01:49:52,670
That I would shoot myself,
and then somehow kill Louise and Bouc.

1945
01:49:54,005 --> 01:49:57,133
He's right. He couldn't have killed them.

1946
01:49:57,633 --> 01:49:59,135
He did not kill them.

1947
01:49:59,969 --> 01:50:03,222
The second and third murders
were committed

1948
01:50:03,306 --> 01:50:04,515
by his accomplice in the first,

1949
01:50:04,724 --> 01:50:09,979
and, I believe, by the mastermind
behind this entire ingenious plot.

His lover once. His lover still.

1953
01:50:21,908 --> 01:50:24,952
Introducing the couple. Stalking them.
Finding them aboard this ship.

1954
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:27,288
Shooting Simon with a blank.

1955
01:50:27,455 --> 01:50:30,082
All to create two unassailable alibis.

1956
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:31,834
The grieving husband
left to inherit his wife's fortune

1957
01:50:32,001 --> 01:50:34,545
and then, in time,
to marry the woman he loves.

1958
01:50:35,463 --> 01:50:37,465
Has always loved.

1959
01:50:38,132 --> 01:50:41,761
When I asked Louise Bourget if she had
seen anything, she gave a curious answer.

1960
01:50:41,928 --> 01:50:45,139
"If I had come outside my cabin,
I might have seen the killer."

1961
01:50:45,306 --> 01:50:49,393
Not yes, not no,
but a veiled threat to Linnet's killer,

1962

<i>who was present in the room.</i>

1963

Simon Doyle.

1964
01:50:53,523 --> 01:50:56,526
Who then assured her that Louise
would be taken care of.

1965
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:57,902
<i>Indeed, she was.</i>

1966
01:50:58,069 --> 01:51:01,531
<i>As soon as he was able, Simon,
no doubt, sent a message to Jacqueline,</i>

1967
01:51:01,697 --> 01:51:04,242
<i>warning her of the new danger.</i>

1968
01:51:04,408 --> 01:51:06,410
<i>Telling her where to find a weapon.</i>

1969
01:51:08,412 --> 01:51:09,747
And then, when Bouc...

1970
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:28,641
When Bouc detected who had killed Louise,
Simon shouted...

1971
01:51:28,808 --> 01:51:29,809
SIMON: Come on!

1972
01:51:30,393 --> 01:51:34,105
...a warning to his accessory...

1973

wiped of fingerprints, yes.

But it came with a gift.

The handkerchief.

1985

The warm waters of the Nile in springtime

1986
01:52:18,107 --> 01:52:20,776
would set the color of blood
to a dull brown.

01:59:33,292 --> 01:59:35,127
(CHORUS CONTINUES VOCALIZING)

01:59:38,172 --> 01:59:41,925
<i>Stand</i>

01:59:42,092 --> 01:59:47,139
<i>By me</i>
