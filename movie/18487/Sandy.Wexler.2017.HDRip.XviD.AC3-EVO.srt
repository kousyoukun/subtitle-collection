1
00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,018
They said he was out
the door in two weeks.

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,853
Then I hear the guy's
re-upped for five years.

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:20,938
The label hated it.

4
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,315
This castle belongs to
the Duke of Gloucester.

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,735
So I realize that was the guy who kept
angrily staring at me the whole time.

6
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,571
Hey, Kevin. Hey, Lorne.

7
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,280
- You ready for this?
- Yeah, what's that?

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,865
Oh, oh! We're gonna do the thing.
Okay.

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,158
All right, you want to start it off?

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,703
- Talk to you, or talk to the lens?
- Either way.

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,914
So, Sandy Wexler...

12
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,752
Where do I begin?

13
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,088
He may be the most
unique guy I ever met.

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,717
If you were working in Los Angeles
in the '90s, any time in there,

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,259
you'd run into Sandy Wexler
at some point.

16
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,637
Sandy was one of those
fringe Hollywood managers

17
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,430
that you always sort of saw around.

18
00:00:55,513 --> 00:01:00,102
You know, you'd see him at a wrap party,
and he'd be laughing, stuffing his face.

19
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,730
You'd think,
"No one even invited this guy."

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,733
Sandy said I could be
the next Patrick Swayze.

21
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,151
Only thing he ever said to me
that made sense.

22
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,155
Sandy was not a big shot.
He was a... He was a tiny shot.

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,534
But anybody who met him,
you never forgot him.

24
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,747
You know, you gotta remember there
was no YouTube, there was no Vines.

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,707
And none of that...
None of the social media platforms.

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,834
You really needed a guy
like Sandy to be seen.

27
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,130
Not Sandy.
Not Sandy, but a guy like Sandy.

28
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:02,247
Hey, Arsenio!
Nice to see you again, kiddo.

29
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,749
Have I seen you before?

30
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,334
Yeah, it's Sandy Wexler.

31
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,213
I met you at Bernie's beach house,
with Doug and Danny.

32
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,174
You guys were playing hangman.

33
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,219
You were hysterical that night. No one
could figure out the word "canoe."

34
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,056
I have no idea
what you're talking about, man.

35
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,725
How you doing with your manager, kid?
Are you still fighting?

36
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,727
I don't have a manager, man.

37
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,354
Well, you do now. If you want one.

38
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,106
No, I'm good. I... I have an agent.

39
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,025
- Oh.
- As a matter of fact, I have six agents.

40
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,234
Got plenty of white people in my life.

41
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,319
- All right.
- I'm good, dawg.

42
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,448
An agent is business.
A manager is family.

43
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,703
He guides you. He advises you.
He fights the good fights.

44
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,329
Makes the tough phone calls.

45
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,666
Truth is, I'm not happy unless...
unless you're happy.

46
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,169
So what do you say, Arsenio?
You wanna get happy together?

47
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,132
Continued success, Arsenio!

48
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,761
Okay? Oh!

49
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,513
I got a hit on the hip, and it's Sinbad.

50
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,474
I don't think any of those people
were really beeping him.

51
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,018
'Cause he would just go, like,
"Oh, jeez, Mackenzie Phillips."

52
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,394
The one thing about Sandy is,

53
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,189
- he just never stopped lying.
- Always.

54
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,984
Managers get used to lying,
but Sandy took it to an art form.

55
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,822
Where am I? I'm in Joel Silver's office
right now, talking about you.

56
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,198
If you land on your feet...

57
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,616
Hey, buddy, how long are you gonna be?

58
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,870
Excuse me, I am talking
to Lew Wasserman's neighbor right now.

59
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,832
That was Janet Maslin from the Times.

60
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,125
Sandy's personal life?

61
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,878
- I know nothing. I know nothing.
- Did he have a personal life?

62
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,880
- He wasn't married.
- Didn't date.

63
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,840
It was sad. Seemed like he
didn't have any friends, right?

64
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,841
He had no friends.

65
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,139
Any good?

66
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,729
No, no, no, no, no, no.

67
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,650
That's great.

68
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,197
But he was the king of the fake laugh

69
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,909
- and the applauding combo. Yeah.
- Combo. Yeah.

70
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,247
Next time he'll get his own ketchup.

71
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,793
You gotta go.

72
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,003
Is Mary Jo Slater
the casting agent on this?

73
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,379
- No. I don't know.
- Good job, guys.

74
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,715
I was in Nam.
But, you know, I was there in 1984,

75
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,427
so it was... It was a different vibe.

76
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,598
And then all I hear in the back is...

77
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,688
- He would fake laugh at funny comics.
- That melon.

78
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,816
It was like, "Why are you fake laughing?

79
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,567
- It's Eddie Murphy. He's funny."
- Right!

80
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,153
When it came to eating
with Sandy, he, um...

81
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,322
It was like a smorgasbord on his face.

82
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,491
I mean, he was on the Atkins diet, right?
So he always had, like, chicken...

83
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,202
- Kielbasa.
- T-bone steak.

84
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,619
- Brisket.
- Beef jerky.

85
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,622
I never actually ate with Sandy,
but I did hear it was kind of gross.

86
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,335
Can you close your mouth
just a little bit?

87
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,922
What did I do?

88
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,842
He dressed like your grandfather,

89
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,888
he had the table manners of a horse,
but he was a great manager.

90
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,057
He really cared about his clients.

91
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,893
He made them his family.
He was with them all the time.

92
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,105
And, uh, I wasn't sure
what he was doing for them,

93
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,189
but you could feel the love.

94
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,986
I spoke to Chili's. I think I can
get us the corner table there

95
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,570
and preorder the appetizers.

96
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,239
I don't give a shit
about Chili's right now.

97
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,824
I thought you wanted to go to Chili's.

98
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,492
- No, I never said that.
- You said that.

99
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,869
That's okay.

100
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,329
You're nervous.
I can see that you're sweating.

101
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,705
- I'm scared, Sandy.
- Yeah.

102
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,916
I gotta jump over ten trailers
and land on a waterbed.

103
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,086
Why are you laughing?

104
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,130
Because you're funny.
You make me laugh.

105
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,507
- Well, I'm not trying to be funny.
- No, it's the way you said it.

106
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,425
The way I said...
What are you...

107
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,094
Look at the size of this crowd.

108
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,181
You said they'd come, and they came.

109
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:53,436
Ladies and gentlemen
of El Segundo Motor Home Court,

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,397
here to defy gravity,

111
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,653
please let's welcome Wild Gary Roberts!

112
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,738
- Rodgers!
- Rodgers!

113
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
He said that. He said Rodgers.

114
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,701
Yeah, 'cause I told him to!

115
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,162
He said it the first time.

116
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,541
I... I wish we could...
'Cause he did say it the first time.

117
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,335
- Stop talking.
- All right. I will.

118
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,963
You get up there
and you show these people who you are.

119
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,049
Gary Rodgers.

120
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,051
It's Gary Rodgers. You said that, right?

121
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,177
The second time.

122
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,761
Yeah, but you knew it.

123
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,513
Okay, guys, let's do this.

124
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,026
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're...

125
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,489
What are you pointing to?
I can only go forward.

126
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,412
Oh, my God.

127
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,498
He's really gonna jump
over all those trailers?

128
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,835
Sir, my client is the best daredevil
trapeze artist in the world.

129
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,003
Thank you very much.

130
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,672
Let's go.

131
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,549
Yeah!

132
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,969
What?

133
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,182
...Oh, shit!

134
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,809
Jesus Christ!

135
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:16,979
Sandy.

136
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,523
- He had this one guy, Ted Rafferty...
- Oh, yeah.

137
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,526
...who was a, you know, puppet act.
Not that good. Like, a middle act.

138
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,612
He believed in him.
He thought he was the greatest.

139
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,323
He's like, "I'm gonna make him
the next Mr. Buttons."

140
00:07:30,033 --> 00:07:33,036
So, uh, Charlie,
have you always been a puppet?

141
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,039
Well, I don't know.
Have you always been a parade float?

142
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,834
I'm just trying
to get to know you better, that's all.

143
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,170
Know me better?
I'm sitting on your lap.

144
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,715
No, but seriously,
what's it like being a puppet?

145
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:47,592
Well, I come from
a long line of puppets.

146
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:51,179
My father was a puppet.
My father's father was a puppet.

147
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,890
Really? Was your father's father's
father a puppet?

148
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,686
Wait for the punch line, buddy.

149
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:05,360
Somebody call JCPenney.
One of the mannequins is on the loose.

150
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:09,781
Sir, have you ever had
a date in your life?

151
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,408
Actually, I have.

152
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,785
Your Anita Bryant poster doesn't count.

153
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:20,625
But honestly, sir,
how long have you been dead for?

154
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,176
Where do you come up with this stuff?
I wish you didn't.

155
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:31,011
That was hysterical.

156
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:32,387
So you caught the whole show, then?

157
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,182
I saw every word of it.
It was sensational.

158
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,766
I saw you come in late!

159
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,394
Nah. Nah, I was there the whole time.

160
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,188
Will you get a load of this bullcrap.

161
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:43,565
I was. I was.

162
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:45,567
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
now, guys, guys, please.

163
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,319
All right. Sandy, I... I believe you.

164
00:08:47,402 --> 00:08:48,611
Thank you, Ted.

165
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:53,158
And I was thinking, you'd do so well now
with the beach theater crowd.

166
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:57,870
And you've got the once a month gig
opening for Fred Travalena at the Trop.

167
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,456
I don't wanna lose that.

168
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,042
It might be time
to move on to the next level.

169
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,960
Kicking the piss out of you?

170
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,838
No. Television.

171
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,049
But...

172
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:11,509
I don't know the first thing
about the TV business.

173
00:09:11,593 --> 00:09:12,677
That's why you got me.

174
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,012
- I know my way around the networks.
- Liar!

175
00:09:15,097 --> 00:09:18,516
Hey, I've had a relationship
with CBS since 1965

176
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,518
when I was a PA on Gilligan's Island.

177
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:24,772
Now, look, kids love the puppets.
And I know there's an audience for that.

178
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,191
Mmm, maybe.

179
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,776
Well, what about this?

180
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:32,447
I know it's out of left field,
but how about a show for kids?

181
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,657
Yeah, I was just saying that.

182
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,243
So we agree.

183
00:09:37,785 --> 00:09:40,288
My favorite thing about Sandy
is where he lived.

184
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,914
The place was a palace.

185
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:44,126
He lived
on the biggest property in Bel Air.

186
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,210
Yeah.

187
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,586
Gorgeous pool.

188
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:49,631
One of the finest collections
of luxury cars I've ever seen.

189
00:09:50,215 --> 00:09:53,718
Make sure you hydrate, Yoshi!
It's a hot day!

190
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,723
Of course, none of it belonged to Sandy.

191
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:00,808
It was owned by some Jewish Iranian...

192
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,936
The guy never even set foot
in the United States.

193
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,356
...who needed Sandy there
for legal reasons.

194
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:10,067
And he was not allowed
in the main house.

195
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:12,737
He was in the cabana by the pool.

196
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,907
...No, no, no, no.

197
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:20,370
Oh, no! Oh, no, no!
No, no, no!

198
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,372
Stay! Stay! Stay!

199
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:28,253
I've lived here for four years already.
You should know me by now.

200
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:30,963
Get to see the face.
The king of Hollywood.

201
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,048
Do you understand me?

202
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,550
- Sandy?
- Ahh!

203
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:39,013
Oh. Hi, uh, Amy.
Hi, Donna and Kendra.

204
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,640
- Lola.
- Jesse.

205
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:44,144
Yeah, that's right.
Wow, they're getting sharp.

206
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:47,104
What brings you all the way out here
from Tarzana?

207
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,357
Well, you said you'd watch the kids
while I go on the audition.

208
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,442
Is that still okay?

209
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:56,364
Oh, don't be silly. Of course.
We're gonna have a good time, guys.

210
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,532
I have to get it, Sandy.

211
00:10:57,615 --> 00:10:59,909
I'm working two jobs
just to tread water out here.

212
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:04,747
You're the quintessential American mother.
Oscar Mayer would be crazy to pass on you.

213
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,835
Oscar Mayer? I thought I was auditioning
to play a hooker in a Wes Craven movie.

214
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:12,297
You know what? My doctor put me
on a new thyroid medicine.

215
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:15,383
He said it might make me foggy,
and I guess he was right.

216
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,927
- Okay, Sandy, I'm gonna go.
- Yeah.

217
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,804
Girls, be nice to Mr. Wexler. Okay?

218
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:20,888
Yes, Mommy.

219
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,724
- Oh, we're gonna have fun, guys.
- Okay.

220
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,976
- Go get 'em, kid. Go get 'em.
- Okay.

221
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,937
Oh, there's dogs out there. They...

222
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:32,442
Hey! Hi, guys. Hi, sweet girl. Hi.

223
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,403
So what are you shmegegges up for?

224
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,948
I have the original script
of On Golden Pond.

225
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,033
Do you wanna read that out loud?

226
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:42,159
No?

227
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,661
What would you like to do?

228
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:44,829
Go swimming?

229
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,540
No, no, no.
That could get me kicked out of here.

230
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,083
I thought you were
the king of Hollywood?

231
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,252
I never said that.

232
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,045
- You said it to the dogs.
- Like a minute ago.

233
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,088
No, I didn't.

234
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:57,717
You guys like roller coasters?

235
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:00,803
Unbelievable.

236
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:05,558
Rifkin left Triad and he's joining forces
with Zifkin over at William Morris.

237
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:12,399
After I was promoted out of the mail-room
at MCA, I was assigned to Frank Gorshin.

238
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:17,445
And Frank Gorshin used to have me
hand-wash the Riddler costume,

239
00:12:17,529 --> 00:12:22,784
because he felt washing machines
might stretch out the material.

240
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:27,622

248

Yes, a very fine swan indeed.

00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:03,282
Take a look at yourself in the lake.

258
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,515
Excuse me.
You were fantastic up there.

259
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,601
- Oh, thanks. You're sweet.
- Yeah.

260
00:13:29,684 --> 00:13:30,893
It's corny, but it's fun.

261
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,730
Corny? That had an edge to it.
I'm Sandy Wexler.

262
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,857
Courtney. Nice to meet you.

263
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,443
I just... I couldn't keep
my eyes off you up there.

264
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,070
Please don't hit on me
in front of your kids. That's creepy.

265
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,864
- He's not our dad.
- No, I'm not.

266
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:43,990
He's the king of Hollywood.

267
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,576
She thinks I said that to the dogs,
but I didn't.

268
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,120
Listen, can we talk somewhere?
I'm a talent manager.

269
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,330
I kinda gotta go.
We have a show every 12 minutes.

270
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:53,833
It'll take four minutes of your time.
It'll be worth it.

271
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:01,215
...someone who advises you,
someone who guides you,

272
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:05,512
who makes the tough phone calls,
fights the big fights.

273
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:07,138
Atkins.

274
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:10,307
I mean, your voice,

275
00:14:10,392 --> 00:14:13,978
it sounds like a...
a bird and an angel had a baby.

276
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,356
And you just so happen to be beautiful.

277
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,526
You can't teach beautiful.

278
00:14:19,609 --> 00:14:22,904
If you could, I'd be in class right now,
believe me.

279
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,198
I'm telling you, you could be somebody.

280
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,619
Come on. If I was gonna be anybody,
I'd be her by now.

281
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,121
Everybody's gotta start somewhere.

282
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:36,250
Buddy Hackett was a dishwasher
in the Catskills till he was 60.

283
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,171
Barbra Streisand started
as a backup singer in a petting zoo.

284
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,383
Liza Minnelli used to
sing in a coal mine.

285
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,510
Wasn't her mother Judy Garland?

286
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,178
No, that's made up.

287
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,808
The mightiest tornado
starts with a small breeze.

288
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,643
You sound like a fortune cookie.

289
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,062
I used to represent a guy
who wrote fortune cookies.

290
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,730
Get out of here.

291
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,274
Yeah, he wrote for Happy Days
and fortune cookies.

292
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,234
Let me ask you something.

293
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,697
Why do you do what you do?

294
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,408
I don't know.

295
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,411
The only time I really feel alive
is when I'm singing.

296
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,832
Well, imagine if you were singing
on stage in front of 50,000 people.

297
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,667
You think you'd feel alive then?

298
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,754
Up there singing like a bird
and an angel had a baby?

299
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,298
You like the bird and angel thing,
don't you?

300
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,925
I said that already?

301
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,052
- Can I ask you something?
- Please do.

302
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,012
Can you get any of that food
in your mouth?

303
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:37,562
So you're saying I should quit right now
and leave with you?

304
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,690
You're too big for this duck pond.
It's time to fly.

305
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,068
You like to make trouble,
don't you, Sandy?

306
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,113
What do you say? Wanna team up?

307
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,408
I'll tell you what I told Josh Gelfand
in the sixth grade

308
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,786
- when he asked me to the spring social.
- Uh-huh.

309
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,122
I'd love to,
but we gotta ask my dad first.

310
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,415
Ooh!

311
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,547
I guess I should have mentioned
my Dad's in Seward, Alaska.

312
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,382
Oh, that's fine. I love it there.

313
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,300
It's beautiful.

314
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,594
- Oh, you've been?
- No, I haven't been there.

315
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,971
- But you just said...
- No, I didn't.

316
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,517
I guess I should have also
mentioned the prison thing.

317
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,601
Are you kidding?

318
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,979
I was in prison my entire childhood.

319
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,275
An emotional prison.
That's a life sentence, I'm telling you.

320
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:29,280
- The Yugo, imported from France.
- Isn't it from Yugoslavia?

321
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:35,620
No. "You go" to France.
"You go" and have a good time. Bonjour.

322
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,750
Hey, Poppy.

323
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,209
How you doing?

324
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,587
Oh, it's always a great day
when I see my little girl.

325
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:49,216
Mr. Clarke, truly a pleasure.
Sandy Wexler of Wexler Artists.

326
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,052
Is this the fool that
want to manage you?

327
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,972
Um, yes, I did come up here
to talk to you about that.

328
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:59,143
And if you're available
to speak, you know, and now's the time,

329
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,688
I would love to have
a conversation about this.

330
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,690
If we could conversate, I'm here to...

331
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,858
What about Six Flags Magic Mountain?

332
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,737
I mean, she got benefits,
a paycheck every week.

333
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,238
That mountain is truly magical.

334
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,364
No, it is.

335
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,368
I just, with all due respect,
I think your daughter has the magic.

336
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,707
With her talent,
she could have a dream-come-true life.

337
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,208
You mean, better than all of this?

338
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,752
What?

339
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,714
Dad.

340
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,591
Who else have you managed?

341
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,218
You ever hear of Indiana Jones?

342
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,803
You work with Harrison Ford?

343
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,222
No, but I do represent the guy

344
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,266
who got his heart pulled out
of his chest in Temple of Doom.

345
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,434
I love that guy.

346
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,019
Everybody does.

347
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,772
I don't know anything
about show business, Sandy.

348
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,107
How do I know if I can trust you?

349
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,862
Because I can look you dead in the eye
and promise you this:

350
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,532
I will always do what's best
for your daughter.

351
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,373
Well, okay. In that case...

352
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,210
♪ You got a new manager ♪

353
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:08,504
♪ Thank you, Daddy ♪

354
00:18:08,588 --> 00:18:10,715
♪ What a wonderful moment ♪

355
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,634
The singing is just for us.

356
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:15,136
Okay. Good. Will do...
Will never do it again.

357
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,429
You guys want to go out and celebrate?

358
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,806
I can't go nowhere.

359
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,101
Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.
Please don't shiv me.

360
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:26,438
Shiv you? Man, I ain't no inmate. I work
here. I've got... got the night shift.

361
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,775
What the... What?

362
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,026
Got ya.

363
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,153
Oh! Ha!

364
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,237
Very good.

365
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,491
Darling, you should take Sandy out
for a dinner and a show, Alaskan style.

366
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,622
- That's amazing.
- Right?

367
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,915
So good.

368
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,210
The northern lights
and my new friend Sandy.

369
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,712
That's as good as it gets.

370
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,589
Northern lights are something else.

371
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,425
I was actually talking
about the burger, though.

372
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,886
Is this bison, or is it moose meat?

373
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,721
What's making it so good?

374
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,890
It's a hamburger, crazy man.

375
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,059
- A hamburger?
- And you're missing out without the bun.

376
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,518
Now, the bun...

377
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,729
If I lose five more pounds,
it's back to the buns.

378
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,814
Oh, my God.

379
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,318
So you really think I could be somebody?

380
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,571
- You are going straight to the top.
- Yeah?

381
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,907
Up there
with all the other beautiful stars.

382
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:19,992
Show me which star I am.

383
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,286
- You wanna know which star you are?
- Yeah.

384
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,454
Let's see.

385
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,165
You are that one right there.

386
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,000
Sandy, that's an airplane.

387
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,462
I know. I told you,
you were going places.

388
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,548
- That's real smooth, Sandy.
- Thank you.

389
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,550
You must be a real lady-killer.

390
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,010
Listen,

391
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,347
if we're gonna do business together,
we gotta have boundaries.

392
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,808
I'm sorry,
but I learned that the hard way.

393
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,392
A bad breakup?

394
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,020
His name was Alfred.

395
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,064
Oh, you're gay!

396
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,399
I can see that now.

397
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,694
No, I'm not gay as far as I know.

398
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,115
- Alfred was my first client.
- Mmm-hmm.

399
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,701
More than that.
He was... He was my best friend.

400
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,994
Did he die?

401
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,286
No, no.

402
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,500
He got famous, and he, uh...
and he dumped me.

403
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,335
That dick!

404
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,964
He wasn't a dick.
I was the dick. It was my fault.

405
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,217
I let the friendship
get in the way of the business.

406
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,221
Now understand it's show business,
not show friendship. Right?

407
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,931
That is so sad.

408
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,475
It's not sad.
It's actually a good thing.

409
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,479
Because I got a stable of talent
in Hollywood

410
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,150
that I, quite frankly,
think is the best of the bunch.

411
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,528
And Eisner knows it,
and Ovitch knows it.

412
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,032
I'm sorry,
and I don't wanna toot my own horn

413
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,993
'cause that's not what I like to do,
but toot-toot.

414
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,828
Hmm.

415
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,622
Best thing to me is I found you.

416
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,542
I'm glad you found me.

417
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,128
You're not as happy as I am.
Trust me.

418
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,672
But we gotta get to work.

419
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,549
Whenever Sandy signed a new client,

420
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,762
he had a team of support people that
immediately began making over the client.

421
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,265
He would just enroll everybody
in classes for the stuff they didn't do.

422
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,267
Movement, martial arts...

423
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,062
A posture person,
and then a hair person.

424
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,439
- And no one was better off after that.
- No.

425
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,523
It was a train wreck.

426
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,775
I'm not a dancer, Sandy.

427
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,069
- It doesn't matter if you can't dance.
- It's all right.

428
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,113
- Miss Gideon is gonna teach you to move.
- I got you, sweetheart.

429
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,532
- It's about presence on stage.
- All right. That's enough, Sandy.

430
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,367
- All right. Here we go.
- It's about being comfortable.

431
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,162
- You know, Baryshnikov, I hear...
- Shut it, Sandy. I got her.

432
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,665
...Who me? Who me? Who me?

433
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:33,709
I'm a rock star. I'm a rock star.

434
00:21:33,793 --> 00:21:37,922
And pass the mic. Pass the mic.
Down the mic. Down the mic.

435
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,340
That's it. That's it.

436
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,175
- That's it. Now you're in it.
- Bobby Brown.

437
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,385
More madness! Stomp the ant.

438
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:45,012
Seattle. Seattle.

439
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,850
- She doesn't know how to dance?
- You're a diva!

440
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:51,978
- This girl can do it all.
- Feel it. And stop!

441
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,229
Hammer time!

442
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,901
Wonderful.

443
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,945
Okay. Let's see it.

444
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:03,780
...Very good.

445
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,158
Very bad.

446
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,619
Complete shit.

447
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,957
You know what? I don't like the ice cream.
It's a bad idea. Looks terrible.

448
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,502
Now let's go sexy, huh?
Can you give me some sexy, Courtney?

449
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,379
Come on.
Let's put on some sexy music, Willow.

450
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:26,762
Okay. Yes. Let's shoop this shit.
Shoop it up, huh?

451
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:29,932
Let's shoop the shoop.
Show me the sexy. Come on.

452
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,475
Give me sexy.

453
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,685
Honey, think of something sexy, huh?

454
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,063
- Like what?
- Like moose burgers.

455
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,648
...And there it is. Shoot that.

456
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:41,860
Ah, Sandy likes it. No one knows why.

457
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,529
Put your hand on your chin.

458
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,448
Not like you're stroking a beard.

459
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,243
Like you're thinking,
thinking filthy thoughts.

460
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:50,995
Like wieners!

461
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,665
Ah, that's good, Willow!
Wieners is good. You're brilliant today.

462
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:56,918
Come on. Hand on chin,
thinking of wieners.

463
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:58,835
I suck at this.

464
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,296
- No, you don't. You're great.
- Oh, come on.

465
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,381
It... You just... It's easy.

466
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:03,590
Then you do it, Sandy.

467
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,009
- Come on. Get over here.
- No, no, no, no.

468
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,095
- You're a performer. I don't do that.
- Come on, Sandy.

469
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,431
You said it's easy.
Dream of the wieners, huh?

470
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,765
Come over here. Come on.

471
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,850
Do I wear my glasses,
or do I take them off? Or...

472
00:23:13,935 --> 00:23:15,519
Nobody gives a shit. Come on.

473
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,522
Eh...

474
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,400
- You put your hand on the chin.
- Uh-huh.

475
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,152
You just... You think.

476
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,782
Huh? Just thinking.
Little more thinking over here.

477
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:31,410
Yes, that's brilliant.

478
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:35,164
Beautiful. Thank you, Sandy.
Clear out of frame.

479
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:37,124
- Get out.
- No, I'm gonna miss him.

480
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:40,211
No, you'll be fine.
Sexy will be right over here.

481
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,503
- Don't worry.
- I'll be there.

482
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,922
He's still got his hand on his chin.
He's so cute.

483
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:46,300
Ah, that's much better.

484
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:48,302
Yes, that's it.

485
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,346
Yes, now I see sexy.

486
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,980
The definition of, like, a given

487
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:01,482
is that kids wake up
and they think, "Me so horny."

488
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:05,277
And then, you know, you don't need
a song that just reinforces,

489
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:06,695
they know they're so horny.

490
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,198
If it was, like, "Me So Introspective"
or something like that.

491
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:11,575
Or "Me So Ambivalent" or...

492
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,994
Just so good.

493
00:24:13,077 --> 00:24:16,622
Talk about fearless.
Best in town by far.

494
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,374
Isn't she?

495
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,583
She? Who's she?

496
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:21,377
What?

497
00:24:22,003 --> 00:24:24,505
- Did you call him?
- Yeah, I called him.

498
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:25,756
What'd he say?

499
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,011
- What'd who say?
- The guy you called.

500
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:31,512
Who did I call?

501
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,598
The guy from
the Young Comedians Special.

502
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,018
Oh, yeah. No, I gotta call him.

503
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:39,895
- So you didn't call him?
- No, I called him.

504
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,230
No, you didn't.

505
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,689
I thought you called him.

506
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,151
Sandy, you're making
even less sense than usual.

507
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,110
No, I'm not.

508
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,195
- Something's off.
- Off how?

509
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,906
I don't know. Different.

510
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,325
Did you dye your hair or something?

511
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:54,993
I don't think so.

512
00:24:55,077 --> 00:24:56,620
Maybe it's a brain tumor.

513
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,205
Maybe it is.

514
00:24:58,289 --> 00:25:01,792
- Anyway, can we run lines?
- Yeah, that's why I'm here.

515
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:05,712
I need to know the truth,
you son of a bitch!

516
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:09,466
All right, I dyed my hair.
Just the tips. You happy?

517
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,302
No, the line, Sandy.

518
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,055
I know. I was improvising.

519
00:25:14,138 --> 00:25:16,432
But you want this line? Um...

520
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:21,228
"The truth? You wouldn't know the truth
if it bit you on the..."

521
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:22,604
Bird.

522
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:24,815
We gotta find a way.
Don't you think, Sandy?

523
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,151
Sandy?

524
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,153
A way? What way?

525
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,113
A way to get rid of the birds.

526
00:25:31,197 --> 00:25:34,616
Yeah, a bird and a baby had an angel.

527
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,535
Are you stoned or something?

528
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:39,413
Stoned? I don't do pot. Come on.

529
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:43,542
Well, you seem stoned out of your mind.
What's with the crazy smile?

530
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:48,380
I don't know, I'm just smiling at the fact
you might become the new Captain Kangaroo.

531
00:25:48,464 --> 00:25:49,840
He's lying again.

532
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,467
No, I'm not. I'm not lying.

533
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,679
I've been thinking about how you
can work on your kid-friendly material.

534
00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:57,306
Maybe go to Magic Mountain.

535
00:25:57,389 --> 00:26:00,184
When you see all the children on line,
just start doing jokes for 'em.

536
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,561
- See if it works.
- That feels very child molestery.

537
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,106
He wants to ruin you. Fire him!

538
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:07,399
Fire me?
If you're firing anybody, I'd fire him.

539
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,151
He's useless. He does nothing.

540
00:26:09,235 --> 00:26:11,112
I do everything! What do you do?

541
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,155
Guys, guys, guys!
Come on, we're on the same team here.

542
00:26:13,239 --> 00:26:15,073
- That's what I'm trying to tell him.
- Yes.

543
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,367
Teammates?

544
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,535
Yeah, thank you.

545
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:23,081
- You took my arm! You took my arm!
- Oh, come off it. That's...

546
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:25,126
- You took my arm!
- That's not...

547
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,835
Thank you, Martin.

548
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:31,257
Let's find out who the judges chose
as returning champ tonight.

549
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,594
The judges gave Kevin Connors one star

550
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:39,264
and the champion,
Martin Lawrence, four stars!

551
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:41,057
The new champion, Martin Lawrence.

552
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,187
...Oh... Come on.

553
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,314
Wexler Artists.

554
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,275
- It's me.
- Hi, Kevin.

555
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,401
Did you know that was on?

556
00:26:50,484 --> 00:26:52,944
No. I didn't know
they were gonna repeat it.

557
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:54,613
- I never want to see that again!
- Well...

558
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:58,784
I can't stop them, Kevin, legally,
'cause we signed an agreement.

559
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,619
It's... They own the material.

560
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,432
Well, she'd light up a room
in that purple one.

561
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,984
Sandy!

562
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:35,487
Barry Bubatzi.

563
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,155
Barry.

564
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,826
Yeah, I was Carr D'Angelo's assistant?

565
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:44,288
- Hiccups? That's you?
- Yeah.

566
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,915
- Look at this. Hiccups.
- Yeah.

567
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,292
Bubatzi!

568
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,043
He... he called me Hiccups

569
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,588
because I had the hiccups this one time
I was on the phone with him.

570
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,381
Well, listen,
he didn't just have the hiccups,

571
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:55,757
he had the hiccups.

572
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:57,676
- He wouldn't stop hiccupping.
- Yeah.

573
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:01,222
Uh, you can die from hiccups.
I was terrified.

574
00:28:01,305 --> 00:28:02,973
I was actually concerned.

575
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:06,268
...It was nerve-racking. A little bit.

576
00:28:06,352 --> 00:28:09,438
How's your sister?
Did she get into Penn State?

577
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,649
- She just graduated.
- Another successful Bubatzi.

578
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,612
- You see, that is why I love this guy.
- What?

579
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,115
He actually talked to me
when I was just an assistant.

580
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,200
You treated me with respect, Sandy.

581
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,827
- Not many people did.
- Well, of course.

582
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,829
- This is my girl, Mary.
- Hi.

583
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,122
Mary. Sandy Wexler.

584
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,374
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

585
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,833
Are you...
What happened to your arm?

586
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,588
- Yeah, I got myself a tattoo.
- What'd you get?

587
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,716
Uh... it is that of a dog bite.

588
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,094
So how's Carr D'Angelo?

589
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,139
Well, he, uh... he left.
He's working for Blockbuster Video now.

590
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,352
Smart move. The music business
has its ups and downs,

591
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,438
but Blockbuster Video's here
for the long haul.

592
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,190
And you, what are you up to?

593
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,484
I left, too.

594
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,778
- I'm at Capitol Records now.
- Oh.

595
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,238
He's head of A&R.

596
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,574
You know how happy that makes me?

597
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,035
Hiccups Bubatzi goes big time.

598
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,579
That's just...
That's the way it should be.

599
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,831
You worked your ass off, kiddo.

600
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,501
Can I talk business for a second?
Is that all right?

601
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,628
I have a client that, actually,
you would love to meet...

602
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,962
- Tell you what...
- What?

603
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:19,550
Call my office next week. Yeah.

604
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,843
I mean, you sure? 'Cause I will call.

605
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:23,970
I know.

606
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,764
- It was great seeing you, pal.
- It was great seeing you.

607
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,267
And I hope, uh,
one of those dresses works out for you.

608
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,436
- Oh, no, this isn't...
- Cute.

609
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,604
- It was... I mean...
- So good.

610
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,774
It's a Bubatzi world. We're all just...

611
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,818
Could you please
not block the whole aisle?

612
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,195
We're all just living in it.

613
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,655
I wasn't blocking the aisle.

614
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,454
Wow.

615
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,041
- Hi.
- Hey, neighbor.

616
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,960
Hi, Cindy!

617
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,212
Where's that
billionaire landlord of yours?

618
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,506
Is he ever going to grace us
with his presence?

619
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,425
What a question.

620
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,177
Listen, he's supposed to come out
for Rosh Hashanah,

621
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,179
but he said last year Purim,
so who knows?

622
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,223
...But anyways, how are you?

623
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,600
How is your husband?

624
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,728
Doctors say it could be
any day now. Hmm.

625
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,564
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's just...

626
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,609
How are you doing?
No one ever asks how you're doing.

627
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,693
How you feeling?

628
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,195
The truth is that I'm just...

629
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,155
a little bit lonely.

630
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,493
You were together so long.
Of course you're lonely.

631
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,161
So if you ever see
my tennis court lights on at night...

632
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,374
that means that I could
use some company.

633
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,464
- It was great to see you, Cindy.
- Bye, Sandy.

634
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,134
Okay, we're gonna go.
All right. Good night, now.

635
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,552
Good night.

636
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:48,389
Look, Gary Rodgers can't make that jump

637
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,892
unless you clear
every bird from the sky, Tom.

638
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,399
I don't know. Is there a spray for it?
Like, a... a roach spray or...

639
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,275
There's dogs. There's dogs.

640
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,277
A roach spray for birds.

641
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,865
Tom, I'm sorry.
That's not my job. That's your job.

642
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,909
That's why I'm telling you.

643
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,327
I'm telling ya!

644
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,205
Listen, don't do that to me!
I'll pull the plug on this thing!

645
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,874
Do you hear me?

646
00:31:17,418 --> 00:31:20,629
All right. I'm sorry I got hot there,
Tom, but you weren't listening.

647
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:24,340
Okay, here's a stock tip
for you to make up for that.

648
00:31:24,425 --> 00:31:26,718
Pull all your money out of Apple,

649
00:31:26,802 --> 00:31:28,887
'cause no one's using
the Macintosh anymore.

650
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:35,351
Put 80% into small local bookstores,
the other 20% into Woolworth's.

651
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,271
Righto.

652
00:31:38,397 --> 00:31:41,775
- Look at you, Mr. Manager Man.
- You don't wanna yell at people,

653
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:43,944
but sometimes
it's the only way they can hear.

654
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,111
You look stunning.

655
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:50,451
Well, this yard is the most amazing yard
I've ever seen, and that pool...

656
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,327
The pool's off-limits. House rules.

657
00:31:52,411 --> 00:31:54,788
So, Yuri stopped by my office.

658
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,583
Yeah, I know. He's right there.

659
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,754
You see him? Let's go over.

660
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:06,508
We need to find the one
that expresses the right message.

661
00:32:06,592 --> 00:32:09,636
You know, "I'm fun.
I'm complicated. I'm sexy."

662
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,930
I'm confused. I'm crazy.
I'm embarrassed.

663
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:14,475
You're beautiful is what you are.
Stop that.

664
00:32:14,558 --> 00:32:17,060
...Got a hit on the hip.

665
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,813
This is someone I actually have to call.

666
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,816
Okay, I'll be back in a few seconds.

667
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,568
Okay, cool, we'll be in the pool.

668
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:26,653
You stay out of the pool.

669
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:27,904
I was just kidding.

670
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,824
I know, and it was hysterical.

671
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,743
But seriously, stay out of the pool.

672
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:34,911
No, not you, Barry. Hi!

673
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:39,124
- I don't know how you do it.
- Do what?

674
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,043
Deal with all the crazy Sandy shit.

675
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:45,130
- Man, he's such a...
- Boner face?

676
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,716
- I love that.
- He's not a boner face.

677
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,676
- He's a badass.
- Okay.

678
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,597
Well, listen, this girl is one
of the best singers you'll ever see,

679
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,016
and the best, brightest person ever.

680
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:59,853
I'm gonna go with the one
on the top right corner.

681
00:33:00,521 --> 00:33:03,356
And can you blow up... that one?

682
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:05,567
Oh, my God.

683
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,152
What? It's a good picture.

684
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,613
Sandy already asked me
to do that for him.

685
00:33:12,866 --> 00:33:14,701
I have some interesting news.

686
00:33:14,785 --> 00:33:18,079
Capitol Records wants
to meet with you next week.

687
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:19,831
They want to hear your demo.

688
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,751
I don't have a demo.

689
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,878

00:34:10,215 --> 00:34:12,300
You nailed it. That was...

698
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,761
Thank you so much.

699
00:34:14,844 --> 00:34:17,138
I'm gonna play this back in here.

I can't get over what I just heard. Wow.

There's a chance I forgot to hit record.

705
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,492
What do you mean
there's a chance you forgot?

706
00:34:37,576 --> 00:34:39,703
- I... I was gonna hit record...
- Uh-huh.

707
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:42,163
Uh, then I forgot.

708
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,833
So it's more than a chance.

00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,418
- You... you did forget?
- Yes.

710
00:34:48,003 --> 00:34:50,756
Okay, so what do we do now?

711
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,800
Is it another deck you have?
Is it in the board?

712
00:34:53,884 --> 00:34:55,135
No.

713
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:58,639
- So we'll have to do it again.
- Okay.

714
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,224
Okay? It's okay with you?

715
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,685
If it's okay with you to do it again.

716
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,187
- That's where we are right now, huh?
- Okay.

717
00:35:06,271 --> 00:35:07,522
Let's just go again.

718
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:14,112
Courtney, there was an issue
on the subwoofer.

719
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,571
It was a bit tinny.

720
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:18,283
We adjusted that,
and we're ready for you this time.

721
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:22,162
I'm sorry. On us, not you.
Just one more time.

722
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,581
We're gonna keep our eyes
on the road. Okay?

it's as good as your first one.

00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:09,751
It was so on the money.

733
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,879
You were hitting notes
I didn't know were invented yet.

734
00:36:12,963 --> 00:36:16,091
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I'm gonna take a listen.

you would never press the button.

You didn't remember to put the button
on your goddamn overalls!

Is everything okay out there?

739
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,785
Yes, kiddo,
we are doing just fine. Um...

740
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,831
We need to go one last time.
There was a glitch.

741
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:53,669
There was a tremolo-treble-bass hiccup
that we have rectified,

742
00:36:53,754 --> 00:36:55,463
and we're ready for ya.

Three time's the charm. Ha!

00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,386

- Yeah.

He's a good man. A smart man.

Um, he felt bad that you didn't get
into Hillcrest Country Club this year.

768
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:38,024
Oh, listen, that's not his fault. I was...
That was fine. There's other clubs.

No, actually I think
that his was the deciding vote.

770
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:44,697
No. It's a capacity thing.
It's not his fault. It's...

771

Let's do the meeting.

772
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:48,368

00:38:50,871 --> 00:38:53,706
Everybody got their Fruitopia?
Good, good, good.

775
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,291
So, spoke to Barry.

776
00:38:55,375 --> 00:38:57,543
And, uh, Barry wanted us
to listen to your demo,

777
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:59,754
and I gotta say, some good stuff there.

778
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:00,839
Thank you.

779
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:04,425
Just to... I mean, to me, no one's doing
what this kid is doing out there.

780
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,761
It's... it's not Mariah.
It's not Whitney. It's...

781
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,264
Well, listen, if she got the album sales
of Whitney, we'll take it.

782
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,431
...Oh. Well, no,

783
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:13,434
in terms of sound
and commerciability, absolutely.

784
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,854
It's definitely Whitney.
It's a Whitney, 100%.

785
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,480
- Yeah, it has potential.
- Well, hold on now.

786
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,232
The production quality is complete shit.

787
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,609
Complete shit. Terrible.

788
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,321
But the song has potential.
Yeah, no diggity, no doubt.

789
00:39:25,405 --> 00:39:26,489
- Thank you.
- That's it.

790
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,366
The song is all we're worried about.

791
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,785
You gotta lose the corny triangle,
though, man.

792
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,497
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, consider that gone.

793
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,583
Let me ask you something, man.
Whose insane idea was that, anyway?

794
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:40,628
Whose idea was it? Was it your idea?

795
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,213
No, it was that...
It was the engineer's.

796
00:39:42,297 --> 00:39:45,300
I gotta be honest.
It was absolutely ridiculous.

797
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:49,345
I mean, how big of an asshole
do you have to be to say,

798
00:39:49,429 --> 00:39:51,890
"You know what? Let's put a...

799
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:54,100
...at the end of a ballad"?

800
00:39:56,561 --> 00:39:59,147
So, ready to check out our digs?

801
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:04,235
This is Studio A.

802
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,157
Les Paul helped engineer it,
and Sinatra made it infamous.

803
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,160
I'm telling you,
this studio is all that...

804
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,787
and a bag of chips.

805
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,414
Yes.

806
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:20,626
See this star here?

807
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:24,047
This star marks the spot
with the best acoustics on the...

808
00:40:26,216 --> 00:40:27,550
Sandy?

809
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:30,511
- How many of these things are there?
- We got a lot.

810
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:33,139
- Can we talk about this star for a second?
- Yeah, go ahead.

811
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,683
It's got the best acoustics
on the entire planet.

812
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,643
- You good, Sandy?
- Comfortable.

813
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,105
- Could I?
- Right there.

814
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:00,125
What the hell?
Why the lights out?

815
00:41:00,208 --> 00:41:02,835
Electric bill?
Did you guys pay it this month?

816
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:05,338
No, he's leaning on the light switch.

817
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,756
No, I'm not.

818
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,883
- Can you step aside, Sandy?
- Sure.

819
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:13,888
What? That wasn't me. Wasn't me.

820
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,598
...Let's try this again.

821
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,977
From the top.

822
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,733
Sandy, step away from the light switch.

823
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,694
I did it on purpose that time.
A joke.

824
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:31,489
I can't make jokes, guys?
Come on.

825
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:35,660
Come on. If we're gonna do business,
we gotta realize it's fun, too.

826
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:39,455
Ha. Ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. Sandy.

827
00:41:39,539 --> 00:41:41,207

862
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:23,518
So Babyface produced it?
Like the Babyface?

863
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,145
Like, the guy with the face of a baby?

864
00:43:25,228 --> 00:43:28,481
He has a very childlike face, it's true.

865
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:30,483
It's so good for women, so strong.

866
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:34,028
It's like Emmylou Harris, if she was
raised in Neil Young's tour van

867
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:37,532
and doing blow with Iggy Pop
and Etta James in a Mississippi bayou.

868
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,617
Wow. Thanks, I think?

869
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:42,120
She doesn't understand how good that is?

870
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:45,248
No, I do. I'm just grateful
you all actually just listened to it.

871
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,667
That's what we do. It's our ritual.

872
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:51,045
Whenever anybody at Wexler Artists
completes a project,

873
00:43:51,129 --> 00:43:53,047
- we gather together.
- We do?

874
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:56,091
We didn't even know
you had other clients until today.

875
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:58,511
Oh, you guys all knew about each other.

876
00:43:58,594 --> 00:43:59,595
I knew you had other clients,

877
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,639
but you told me I was
in a different league from them.

878
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,309
That's what the prick told us, too.

879
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:06,101
Sorry, we've never done
the ritual before.

880
00:44:06,186 --> 00:44:08,688
If it's a first time, Sandy,
how can it be a ritual?

881
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:10,565
Okay, and who is that guy?

882
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,401
Can we put him in a drawer or something?
That's horrifying.

883
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:16,237
Sandy, aren't you forgetting
the best part of the ritual?

884
00:44:16,321 --> 00:44:18,823
- What's that, dear?
- Jumping in the pool.

885
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,741
- Yeah! Let's do it!
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

886
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,660
No, that's not part of the ritual!

887
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,582
No, no, no, wait!
We are not permitted in the pool! Okay?

888
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:30,626
- Firuz forbids it.
- You're not in a cult, are you, Sandy?

889
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:32,420
No, Firuz is my landlord.

890
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:35,840
He does not allow us in the pool.
It is forbidden.

891
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:37,091
No, no. All right!

892
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:40,553
Ah! Don't you come any closer, Sandy.
I'll put my whole foot in, I swear.

893
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,929
No, no!

894
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,889
- Please don't... No!
- Ooh!

895
00:44:43,973 --> 00:44:46,767
No, I am not kidding you, Courtney.
I will let you go as a client.

896
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:48,644
- I didn't wanna have to say that.
- Oh, my God.

897
00:44:48,728 --> 00:44:51,021
Do not put your foot in the pool,
or the career is done.

898
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:52,523
And I'm not... I'm not messing with you.

899
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:54,359
- Oh, God.
- I don't care what you're saying.

900
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:56,068
Whoa!

901
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:58,195
Okay, you did it! You did it!
You did the foot.

902
00:44:58,279 --> 00:44:59,822
You did the foot. The foot is wet.

903
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:03,451
Please come back in the house.
I'm asking nicely.

904
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,620
I just don't have... I can't...

905
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,663
I wasn't gonna go in.

906
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:09,790
I know you weren't gonna go in.

907
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,917
I... I can't joke, too?

908
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:14,044
- Really? "I know you won't."
- I can't joke, too.

909
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,464
Whoo! Cannonball!

910
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,673
Whoo!

911
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,363
Maybe tomorrow. Maybe tomorrow, okay?

912
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,656
Maybe I'll wear you tomorrow.

913
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,616
And... and it's not you guys.
You're doing great.

914
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,785
I love you guys.
I love you guys, all right?

915
00:45:45,868 --> 00:45:47,703
Good night. Good night, everybody.

916
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:48,954
Good night.

I tell you to stay out of my pool,
and what do you do?

927
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,111
You go in my pool.

928
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,657
Uh, nobody went in your pool.
No, no, who told you that? The dogs?

929
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,661
I have cameras everywhere, man.
I'm watching you all the time.

930
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:31,456
You're much better
than anything we have on Iranian TV.

931
00:46:31,539 --> 00:46:33,499
I see you with bacon over the sink,

932
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:36,461
I see you fall asleep in my chair,
watching my Cinemax.

933
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:38,379
And I see your godless friends
in my pool!

934
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,965
No, no, listen, Firuz.
Here's what happened.

935
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:43,468
There was an earthquake in Los Angeles.

936
00:46:43,551 --> 00:46:47,347
So we just went in the pool
'cause it's the safest place to be.

937
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:50,600
But we didn't go all the way in.
No water was touched.

938
00:46:50,683 --> 00:46:53,561
Sandy, you lie all the time, man.
It's embarrassing.

939
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,105
I wish I was lying. I wish I was.

940
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,941
And how many times are you going to
listen to that one song, my friend?

941
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,318
I mean, mix in a little
Miami Sound Machine or something.

942
00:47:01,402 --> 00:47:03,237
It's a client of mine. Courtney Clarke.

943
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,530
What, you don't like it?

944
00:47:04,614 --> 00:47:07,032
The song is good, and I like her, too.

945
00:47:07,116 --> 00:47:09,994
You know, when she was in bathroom,
I got quite a good look at her.

946
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:11,871
- You what?
- Firuz joking.

947
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,374
I don't have cameras
in bathroom anymore.

948
00:47:14,457 --> 00:47:16,376
I had them taken out
when you had the big hemorrhoid.

949
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:19,211
That wasn't a hemorrhoid,
that was a fissure.

950
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:22,882
But, Sandy, people in my pool,
this I do not like!

951
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,675
- I...
- That's strike one, Sandy!

952
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:25,843
I'm telling you...

953
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,846
- You don't want to get strike two.
- I... I agree.

954
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,973
Goodbye from Firuz.

955
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:32,767
Bye-bye.

956
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:41,025
You know, I did tell them not to go
in the pool, and they did it anyway.

957
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:42,985
- So you admit it?
- No! I...

958
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:46,155
Strike two! Firuz knows everything.

959
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:52,870
Okay, what are we doing today, big guy?

960
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:56,040
We going to Jerry's?
Or you want to go to Carney's?

961
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,458
I can go either one.

962
00:47:57,542 --> 00:48:01,128
It's all good for the Atkins.
I can get a frankfurter, no bun.

963
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,338
- I know.
- I can get a plate of roast beef...

964
00:48:03,423 --> 00:48:05,049
- or corn beef...
- Don't go over the whole menu.

965
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,592
I don't give a shit
about your roast beef.

966
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:09,219
Stu Smiley passed on me
for the Young Comedians Special.

967
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:10,805
- That's right. He...
- I don't even believe it.

968
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,264
- He's a moron.
- He's not a moron.

969
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:17,770
He's a pompous know-it-all,
smarmy little Ivy League pussy.

970
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:22,817
- He went to San Diego State... actually.
- You're kidding me right now, right?

971
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,694
You corrected me 'cause
he went to San Diego State?

972
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,236
No, I'm agreeing with you.

973
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:31,784
I'm saying you are too smart
and too topical to be on HBO.

974
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,077
They like young and stupid.

975
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,079
- They like cute and moronic.
- Yes.

976
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:37,915
- Nothing challenging, nothing unfamiliar.
- No.

977
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,876
- They want some, like, ex-Florida DJ...
- Ha!

978
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:42,462
...who's blandly handsome,

979
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:46,841
and his little gimmicks, his voice
cracks on the punch line or he's...

980
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,551
Pretends to be tripping
on acid the whole set.

981
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:51,178
Chinese food?

982
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,639
I don't want Chinese food for lunch.

983
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:56,058
All right, beef and broccoli.

984
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:58,728
This conversation goes a lot better
when it's just me talking.

985
00:48:58,811 --> 00:49:01,564
- I'm not in the conversation?
- Oh, you are, but you aren't.

986
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:05,485
You can let... Blast off on me.
Go ahead. Yell at me as much as you want.

987
00:49:05,568 --> 00:49:08,571
As long as you promise to bring it
on the stage with you tonight,

988
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,072
- and you show HBO...
- I promise.

989
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:11,741
...they don't need to discover you.

990
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,952
Kevin Connors will discover himself.
Thank you very much.

991
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:18,455
What does that even mean?
How do I discover myself?

992
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,583
Do you know how dumb that sounds?

993
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,794
That's one of the... Don't click.
Why're you clicking? Stop clicking!

994
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:26,380
You always click whenever
you get nervous. It's psychotic.

995
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:27,882
Your technique...

996
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,091
What is that?

997
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:31,468
It's, uh... That's Courtney's song.

998
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,721
That's... Ask her what station it is.

999
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:35,598
What station is it?

1000
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:38,142
Excuse me, miss? Oh, wow. Hi.

1001
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:40,227
Oh, my God, I know you.

1002
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,395
- She knows me.
- Hey. Yeah.

1003
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:44,148
Didn't you get one star
on Star Search the other day?

1004
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,858
No.

1005
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,110
This... What station are
you listening to? The number?

1006
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,320
- What?
- The station you're listening to?

1007
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,782
You need to enunciate.
I can't understand what you are saying.

1008
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,700
No, no, what is the dial number?

1009
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:56,493
What are you tripping about, bro?

1010
00:49:56,577 --> 00:49:59,622
I'm asking you
what station you're listening to!

1011
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:01,582
Don't you... What are you...

1012
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,208
Good job. You scared her off.

1013
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,294
Oh, come on here.

1014
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,754
It's your Uncle Joe Benson...

1015
00:50:09,173 --> 00:50:11,383
There it is. There it is!

1016
00:50:12,552 --> 00:50:14,386
This is Courtney's song.

1017
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,014
What are you shocked by?
She's a great singer.

1018
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,140
Oh, my God.

1019
00:50:18,223 --> 00:50:21,018
♪ And we were in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪

1020
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,271
What the hell, Sandy?

1021
00:50:25,815 --> 00:50:27,608
You can take care of this, right?

1022
00:50:27,692 --> 00:50:29,819
My Nautilus place is right here.
I'm gonna go do a circuit.

1023
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,155
How about this song? Huh, guys?

1024
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:39,244
I got Integrity No-Fault Insurance.
How about you?

1025
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:44,625
The song... This song...

1026
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,376
Ha...

1027
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:16,490
Hey, hey.

1028
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,419
You look like a star.

1029
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,338
Thank you!

1030
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,966
You look like Mike Tyson
knocked you out.

1031
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,342
What happened?

1032
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,470
Oh, I ran into a moose on Melrose.

1033
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:42,182
Yeah, it must have escaped
off the Paramount lot.

1034
00:51:42,808 --> 00:51:46,896
- This dress on you...
- I just love it.

1035
00:51:46,979 --> 00:51:50,816
Of course you do. It's from
your dirty magazine page, ya weirdo.

1036
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:55,487
Well, it works!

1037
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,699
What are we doing tonight to celebrate?
You were on the radio!

1038
00:51:58,783 --> 00:52:00,868
Hmm. Well, Bling just called,

1039
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:05,080
and Quincy Jones invited me
to his party tonight.

1040
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:08,918
- Jonesy? Jonesy's having a party?
- Okay. Uh-huh.

1041
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,335
I heard he was gonna have a...

1042
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,921
- I just didn't know when.
- Oh.

1043
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:14,006
So what?
Did you get a plus-one or...

1044
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,507
Yes, plus-one.

1045
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,135
- And I'm the one?
- Yeah.

1046
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:22,181
You know, I met his grandmother
years ago at a Hamburger Hamlet.

1047
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,433
She calls him Quincelius.

1048
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:27,144
So every time I see him,
I say, "Hi, Quincelius."

1049
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,979
He gives me a look like,
"How did he know?"

1050
00:52:29,063 --> 00:52:32,399
Okay, cool.
So should we go to the party?

1051
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,985
You wanna go to it?
Why shouldn't... Let's pop by.

1052
00:52:35,069 --> 00:52:36,403
He lives in Venice, right?

1053
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,613
Uh... no, the address is in Bel Air.

1054
00:52:38,698 --> 00:52:41,867
Oh, so he moved? Okay, okay, he moved.

1055
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,842
Sandy Wexler. Wow.

1056
00:52:57,925 --> 00:52:59,468
They let you in this party?

1057
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,803
Hey, Bronstein.

1058
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:02,847
You heard you didn't get into
Hillcrest Country Club, right?

1059
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:04,014
Yeah, I heard.

1060
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:06,809
This place is incredible!

1061
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:09,019
Yeah, it's nice. It's nice.

1062
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:11,438
His one in Venice wasn't trying as hard.

1063
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,649
Quincy never lived in Venice.
What you talking about, Willis?

1064
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:16,360
What? No, she said he did.

1065
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:19,321
- What?
- She? Oh!

1066
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,990
I'm a huge fan. I'm Arsenio.

1067
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,576
I know, Arsenio. Courtney.

1068
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:29,289
Hey, Arsenio. Good to see you.
I'm Sandy Wexler, her manager.

1069
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:32,459
You remember? We met at, uh...
at Bernie's beach house.

1070
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:35,337
Your manager look like he fell down
an elevator shaft. What's up?

1071
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:39,341
No, no, no. I, uh... Fender bender.
You should see the other guy.

1072
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,593
- Oh, he got hurt?
- Who did?

1073
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:44,054
- The other guy?
- What? No.

1074
00:53:45,765 --> 00:53:48,183
You know what?
I heard your new song, "Mr. DJ."

1075
00:53:48,267 --> 00:53:50,644
I love it. It's off the chain.
You've gotta come on the show and do it.

1076
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,479
- I would love to.
- Oh, well, listen.

1077
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:55,024
I got a call from Johnny Carson
today, actually.

1078
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:59,694
He heard the song as well on the radio,
and he booked her on the show next week.

1079
00:53:59,779 --> 00:54:01,030
Carson?

1080
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,407
Well, congratulations.

1081
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:07,119
You ever need me, Stage 29.
I'll be there forever, baby.

1082
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:10,622
Ah, thanks, Arsenio.
No, I didn't mean any problem...

1083
00:54:10,705 --> 00:54:13,375
You didn't tell me
I was doing Carson next week!

1084
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:17,087
That was a negotiation ploy.
I may have overplayed my hand there.

1085
00:54:17,171 --> 00:54:18,755
Carson retired two years ago.

1086
00:54:18,839 --> 00:54:21,050
Sandy Wexler?
Somebody hide the pastrami.

1087
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:24,219
Hey, thank you. Good to see you, too.

1088
00:54:25,846 --> 00:54:29,224
Wow. Look at all these awards he has.

1089
00:54:29,308 --> 00:54:30,684
You'll have more one day.

1090
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,769
- Me?
- Yes, you.

1091
00:54:32,853 --> 00:54:33,979
You promise me this.

1092
00:54:34,063 --> 00:54:36,523
- After you win your first Grammy...
- Uh-huh.

1093
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:40,485
...you go home that night, you
put your ugly duckling hat on...

1094
00:54:40,569 --> 00:54:41,695
I am not putting that hat on.

1095
00:54:41,778 --> 00:54:43,363
...to remind yourself
where you come from.

1096
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:46,658
- You put it on. I'm not putting it on.
- You don't wanna see me in that...

1097
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,869
Sandy, Sandy, Sandy.

1098
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:51,413
Well, who whooped your ass
and got away with it?

1099
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:56,501
No, this was a high-impact
Tae Bo class I took. It's fine.

1100
00:54:56,585 --> 00:54:57,586
Okay.

1101
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,714
How about our girl here
getting the radio play, huh?

1102
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,757
Did I tell you she's
a superstar or what?

1103
00:55:02,842 --> 00:55:04,468
Oh, yeah, she's getting some heat.

1104
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,803
- Yeah, we'll see where it goes.
- Thanks, Bling.

1105
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:11,433
Excuse me. Excuse me, Shortie Doo-Wop,
can I get two Zimas and for Sandy...

1106
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,435
I'll take a diet ginger ale.

1107
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,563
- Amy Baskin.
- Sandy, what are you doing here?

1108
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,859
I was invited.
Thank you very much. Hi.

1109
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,736
Bling, I want you to meet Amy Baskin.

1110
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,572
To me, she is the next Grace Kelly.

1111
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,242
- I'm trying.
- Amy? Courtney.

1112
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,743
Remember me from the ritual pool party?

1113
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,872
Oh, my God. I heard your song
on the radio twice today.

1114
00:55:32,955 --> 00:55:36,000
- Congratulations, Courtney.
- Oh, well, we got a great manager.

1115
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,585
He told me to always
sing from the heart.

1116
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,171
And I tell this girl,
"Always act from the heart."

1117
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,883
Hey, did we get the offer on
the Mentos commercial I was on hold for?

1118
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:47,719
No, you weren't on hold for it.
What I said was,

1119
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:51,598
"I called them and they put me on hold
for about 45 minutes."

1120
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:55,185
But when they... they got on the phone,
they told me they passed on you.

1121
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:57,938
- Well, there you go.
- No, it's good.

1122
00:55:58,022 --> 00:55:59,523
They said she had a great reading.

1123
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,026
That it truly looked like
she loved the Mentos.

1124
00:56:02,859 --> 00:56:04,111
I'll be back with your drinks.

1125
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,195
- Okay.
- Okay.

1126
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:08,573
Yo, check it out. It's OJ Simpson,
Phil Spector and Robert Blake.

1127
00:56:08,657 --> 00:56:11,493
Good guys.
Call 'em the dream team.

1128
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,162
- I'm gonna go chop it up with 'em.
- All right.

1129
00:56:13,245 --> 00:56:16,123
The juice is on the loose!
What's happening, killer?

1130
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:20,252
So, uh, what do you think?
We've been to the party. We had fun.

1131
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,879
- Time to go?
- I wanna see Jonesy.

1132
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:25,299
- Who's Jonesy?
- Quincy?

1133
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,927
- Oh, Quincy? You wanna see, uh...
- Yeah.

1134
00:56:28,010 --> 00:56:29,386
...Quincelius?

1135
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:30,887
All right. Let's get that done.

1136
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,307
- You think he's around?
- Yeah, it'll be good to see him again.

1137
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,434
Uh, yeah, let's find him.

1138
00:56:36,143 --> 00:56:40,981
Okay, now, Courtney,
it's Domaines Ott Bandol Rosé.

1139
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,316
- My favorite.
- Mmm.

1140
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:50,324
What do you think?

1141
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:53,202
Mmm! This is so good, Mr. Jones.

1142
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,037
What do you think, Sandy?
You like it?

1143
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,998
What's the matter, man?

1144
00:56:58,082 --> 00:57:00,125
Nothing. No, I think it's good.

1145
00:57:00,209 --> 00:57:02,502
It's... it's... It's just grapey.

1146
00:57:03,337 --> 00:57:07,716
- What do you mean "grapey"?
- Oh, I... I didn't say it was a bad thing.

1147
00:57:08,717 --> 00:57:11,178
Okay. I'm gonna try
to respect your opinion, brother.

1148
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:15,515
Let me try another one. I've got
a '61 Château Pétrus downstairs.

1149
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,725
Okay.

1150
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:19,519
I paid eight grand for it
at the Côte de Nuits.

1151
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:21,396
- Yeah, okay.
- That's too much. No.

1152
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,690
Pretty sure this'll get your attention.

1153
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,400
Thank you, Quincelius.

1154
00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,901
Who the hell is Quincelius?

1155
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,155
Nobody. Come on. What are we doing here?

1156
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,659
Thank you.

1157
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:36,954
It was grapey. It was a little grapey.

1158
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:40,624
- I think you offended him.
- No, I didn't.

1159
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,251
I thought it was cool.

1160
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:47,256
When he comes back, I dare you
to say you hate that one, too.

1161
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:48,507
What?

1162
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,843
The man spent $8,000 on the wine.
He'll kill me.

1163
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,638
Oh, we'll laugh our asses off. Come on.

1164
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:59,393
- Courtney, what do you got me doing here?
- I was saving this for a special occasion.

1165
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,270
I think this is special enough.

1166
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,732
You'll have to let me know
what you think, baby.

1167
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,567
Yeah. Thank you.

1168
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,944
Very much.

1169
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,032
What do you think, honey?

1170
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:16,326
Mr. Jones, this is exquisite.

1171
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,037
And, Sanford, you likey?

1172
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,919
- Honestly?
- What else, man?

1173
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,090
- It's a little nutty.
- Nutty?

1174
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,842
For my taste.

1175
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,017
Maybe if you put an ice cube in it...

1176
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,813
- Oh, my goodness.
- Get out of my house!

1177
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,273
- Now!
- Hey, hey, I didn't mean to...

1178
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,402
- Now! Out! Out!
- I'm gonna leave.

1179
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,072
- No, I just got to get my jacket.
- Out! Get... get out of here.

1180
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,781
- Listen.
- Out!

1181
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,202
Man, one of these is mine.
Is this navy or black?

1182
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:02,122
I'm having a hard time seeing.
My glasses are blurry from the wine toss.

1183
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,373
Get out!

1184
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,043
You know what? This is probably it.
I... I'm gonna go.

1185
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,837
- Leave!
- Courtney! Okay.

1186
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,049
Hey. Thank you, Q-bert.
It was a great night.

1187
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,135
- Did you see the way that was...
- You made me do that! You!

1188
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,511
- How are we getting out?
- Are you happy?

1189
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,930
I don't know where...
Go. Just go. Is he coming?

1190
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:22,892
Courtney's first single was huge.
I remember the album was even bigger.

1191
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,937
I heard every song
on every station of every radio.

1192
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,277
Yay, Courtney!

1193
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,116
Courtney blew up
to Whitney Houston-type status.

1194
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,200
Oh, really?

1195
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,951
- So it was crazy.
- Mariah Carey, you know...

1196
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:48,252
You're nobody, and then you're somebody,
and everyone's clamoring after you.

1197
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,837
And it's scary. It can be scary.

1198
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,520
- Sandy...
- Courtney, what's wrong?

1199
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,813
I think someone's outside my house.

1200
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:11,441
I'm scared it's one of those freaks
that's been calling me or something.

1201
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,610
What? Who's calling you?

1202
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,903
I don't know.

1203
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,781
I've been dealing with this
ever since I moved into this place.

1204
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,991
- Are your doors locked?
- Yeah.

1205
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,244
You stay inside. I'll be right there.

1206
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,589
You're in trouble now, tough guy!

1207
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,427
Look what I've been carrying
around in my backseat...

1208
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:42,139
ever since I was attacked
on Ventura Place.

1209
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,434
Huh? You like this?

1210
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,936
You wanna... You wanna feel it?

1211
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,148
Come out! Where are you?

1212
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,026
Courtney, stay in the house!

1213
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,531
What's that?

1214
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,285
What? You think you can hide?

1215
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:09,541
Are you scared? Huh?

1216
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,960
'Cause I'm scared, too.

1217
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,380
I'm scared I'm gonna shatter
every bone in your face!

1218
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,597
You're gone?

1219
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:28,185
That's it. Truce.

1220
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,395
No more.

1221
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,194
Ow!

1222
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:46,745
What you were so afraid of
was nothing but a raccoon.

1223
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:47,829
No way.

1224
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:51,208
I'm telling you, you'll never have to
worry about him again, though.

1225
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,627
You didn't kill him, did you?

1226
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:56,796
No. No. Uh, I...

1227
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,134
I seen him go out into the forest again
to see his family, so...

1228
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,886
All right? But I screamed at him.

1229
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,306
I let him know, "Don't come back here.
You stay with the...

1230
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,351
On your side of the fence."

1231
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,270
Okay.

1232
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:13,272
Come on in.
Let me wash those clothes.

1233
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:17,401
When I used to represent Hooch
from Turner & Hooch,

1234
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:21,738
I got a similar call
about a late-night trespasser.

1235
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,449
Turned out it was Benji's trainer.

1236
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:29,579
Uh, he was jealous that Hooch
was now the hottest dog in the business.

1237
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,707
- You're making that up.
- No, no, no, I think that's true.

1238
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:35,960
You're insane, Sandy.
Take off those pants.

1239
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,298
What? What, right here?

1240
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,424
I won't look.

1241
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,592
Well, you'll be missing out, then.

1242
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,344
Oh, really?

1243
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,221
No. Maybe you should turn around.

1244
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:49,766
Turning around.

1245
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,852
I'm glad you took
this place, by the way.

1246
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,688
The real estate lady told me

1247
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,567
that David Crosby died
three times in this house.

1248
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,902
I'm gonna keep the beeper,
if that's all right.

1249
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,738
Kevin Connors did
a show on Brea tonight,

1250
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:07,867
co-headlining with AJ Jamal.
I wanna make sure that went well.

1251
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,204
So, pants are coming down.

1252
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,373
Here you go.

1253
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,337
All right. Come on.
Let's get these washed.

1254
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,005
Sure. Hey, thanks for doing that.

1255
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,470
You called Bling, too?

1256
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:28,513
Oh, I was here anyway, Sandy.

1257
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,474
With my pants on.

1258
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,064
The important thing
is that Courtney feels safe.

1259
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,066
- That's all I'm worried about.
- Hmm.

1260
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,818
An unlisted phone number.

1261
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,737
That's the way to go
for an artist of your stature.

1262
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,780
I can get that done for you
tomorrow morning.

1263
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:49,075
Oh, no, it's all... It's all good,
Sandy. I handled it already.

1264
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,245
Oh, you did? Good. Good. Good for you.

1265
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,125
Sandy, can you pass me the gravy?

1266
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,712
Can I pass you the gravy?
Absolutely. I can pass you the gravy.

1267
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,547
- Here. You want me to put it on for you?
- I got it.

1268
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:03,923
- You got it?
- Yeah.

1269
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,760
I was thinking we should get back
in the studio, Courtney.

1270
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,262
Maybe noodle around with some new tunes.

1271
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,973
With all due respect, Sandy,
I understand that,

1272
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:15,268
but, uh, her existing record's
gonna be on the charts for months.

1273
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,604
You don't want her competing
against herself now, do you?

1274
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,733
Who else do you want her competing with?
I mean it's a win-win. To me.

1275
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,570
I know what you mean, Sandy.

1276
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:28,865
I have lots of ideas,
but I can't tomorrow.

1277
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,075
We've got publicist meetings.

1278
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:34,371
- Publicists? What... what publicists?
- Oh, yeah, just the top ones.

1279
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,039
You know what?
I'll send you the list, actually.

1280
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,708
You know what?
Better yet, I'll e-mail you the list.

1281
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,545
- What is that?
- Oh, you're not familiar with e-mail?

1282
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:45,382
E-mail? Of course I heard of that.
Which one are you talking about?

1283
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:49,636
You got your computer, right?
And you plug that into your phone line,

1284
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:55,434
and you could send a document to another
computer clear across the country

1285
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,602
in a matter of minutes.

1286
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:01,398
Who licks the envelope? R2-D2?
I'm lost right now.

1287
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,150
Now I think we're making
a wrong move here.

1288
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,321
I have a publicity campaign designed
strictly for this woman right here.

1289
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,533
You have a publicity campaign? Well,
I mean, we're... The family's all here.

1290
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,367
We would love to hear about it.
What is it?

1291
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,870
Well, I usually like my clients
to start slow.

1292
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,997
Keep it simple. Don't overexpose.

1293
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:21,250
- Really, Sandy?
- Yes.

1294
01:05:21,334 --> 01:05:23,252
Just gonna spit your chicken on my face?
That's for you.

1295
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,507
Okay. Maybe we'll hold off
on the publicist thing.

1296
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:28,592
Thank you.

1297
01:05:28,675 --> 01:05:30,343
But then we'll bring in one soon.

1298
01:05:30,427 --> 01:05:32,053
- Okay, boys?
- We'll talk about that.

1299
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:34,222
Absolutely. I think that's smart.

1300
01:05:34,305 --> 01:05:36,307
All right. I'm gonna go check
on these jeans.

1301
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,309
- Okay?
- Yes, my queen.

1302
01:05:38,392 --> 01:05:39,728
Your queen?

1303
01:05:41,688 --> 01:05:46,150
Sandy, you are the reason
she needs a publicist.

1304
01:05:46,234 --> 01:05:47,611
I'm the reason?

1305
01:05:47,694 --> 01:05:50,489
You know how many calls I got after
Quincy Jones threw you out of his party?

1306
01:05:50,572 --> 01:05:54,451
- Oh... She dared me to do it.
- What are you, 14, Sandy?

1307
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:56,911
No, I'm not 14. I'm not 14 at all.

1308
01:05:56,995 --> 01:05:58,412
Your job is to protect her.

1309
01:05:58,497 --> 01:06:00,499
I protect her 24/7!

1310
01:06:00,582 --> 01:06:03,167
And how is that?
By screwing up her shot on Arsenio?

1311
01:06:03,251 --> 01:06:04,794
We got the show, didn't we?

1312
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:06,295
Because I fixed it!

1313
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,423
You fixed it. You did everything.
You invented music.

1314
01:06:09,508 --> 01:06:10,759
What did you do, Sandy?

1315
01:06:10,842 --> 01:06:13,344
Did you file the paperwork for the Grammy
nomination before the deadline?

1316
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,514
Did you squash the story in the Enquirer

1317
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,933
about her corrections officer father
falling asleep during a prison riot?

1318
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,060
Did you send envelopes of cash
to the radio stations

1319
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,436
so they could play her record?

1320
01:06:23,437 --> 01:06:24,939
No, you didn't do that.

1321
01:06:25,023 --> 01:06:26,483
You know how I know
you didn't do it, Sandy?

1322
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,442
Because I did it.
I did all those things.

1323
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:31,112
And what did you do? Hmm?

1324
01:06:31,195 --> 01:06:35,116
You made sure Gary,
the daredevil trapeze artist,

1325
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,036
was her opening act
at the Universal Amphitheatre.

1326
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,038
Gary is family.

1327
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:42,791
This dude shattered his pelvis
on an amplifier!

1328
01:06:42,874 --> 01:06:44,501
I was there. I saw.

1329
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:46,460
There was blood
all over the first three rows!

1330
01:06:46,545 --> 01:06:48,505
- People were vomiting!
- Yeah, all right.

1331
01:06:48,588 --> 01:06:49,798
That doesn't really segue well

1332
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,551
into soulful singer-songwriter now,
does it, Sandy?

1333
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,011
She got 'em back.
She's too good to lose a crowd.

1334
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:56,513
She's too good for you.

1335
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,098
Sandy, she could have
any manager she wants.

1336
01:06:59,182 --> 01:07:00,266
She wants me!

1337
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,519
And that is what's holding her back.

1338
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:05,980
Look, Sandy, you did your job.

1339
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,526
You brought her up to the big leagues.

1340
01:07:09,609 --> 01:07:12,070
I'm telling you. Come on!

1341
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:15,824
But now you're just...
You're out of your depth.

1342
01:07:15,907 --> 01:07:18,284
Don't let your ego get in the way.

1343
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:23,081
Can you look me in the eye and tell me
you're doing what's best for her?

1344
01:07:27,501 --> 01:07:28,753
- Okay.
- Ah!

1345
01:07:28,837 --> 01:07:31,255
Pants-Off Dance-Off
is officially canceled.

1346
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:32,716
- Put these bad boys on.
- Okay.

1347
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:36,803
You got the stain out?
Very nice. Look at you. Look at you.

1348
01:07:36,886 --> 01:07:40,264
Well, I'm beat to shit.
I'm gonna call it.

1349
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:44,102
You're gonna call it?
All right. I'll walk you out, then.

1350
01:07:44,185 --> 01:07:47,689
Thank you for everything.
Appreciate it all.

1351
01:07:57,115 --> 01:07:59,993
Oh. Oh, yeah. Good night.

1352
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:13,464
Thanks for scaring the stalker raccoon.

1353
01:08:13,547 --> 01:08:16,760
You don't have to thank me, Courtney.
That's my pleasure.

1354
01:08:16,843 --> 01:08:17,844
Look, Sandy...

1355
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:21,347
This rock star thing is new to me.

1356
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,558
I'm doing the best I can
to make everybody happy, you know.

1357
01:08:24,643 --> 01:08:28,897
You make the world happy, Courtney.
That's all you need to worry about.

1358
01:08:29,814 --> 01:08:30,899
Thank you, Sandy.

1359
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,402
That's why it's difficult
for me to tell you this.

1360
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:38,114
But where you are right now
in your career,

1361
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:41,868
and what it requires of my time, it's...

1362
01:08:44,037 --> 01:08:48,708
I'm being kind of forced here
to make sacrifices that,

1363
01:08:48,792 --> 01:08:52,045
with good conscience,
I don't really wanna make.

1364
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,587
Like what?

1365
01:08:53,672 --> 01:08:57,676
Like my stable of talent.

1366
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:02,263
I can't give them what I believe
each and every one of them deserves

1367
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:07,894
if I'm worried about all the
complexities of your day-to-day.

1368
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,146
It's a lot, kid. I'm sorry.

1369
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,316
So what? You don't want
to work together anymore?

1370
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:17,403
Well, it's just the current situation
isn't fair to you, either.

1371
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:22,366
I can't commit to you 100%
if I got other things on my mind,

1372
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:25,119
which unfortunately I do.
The stable.

1373
01:09:25,203 --> 01:09:27,831
Sandy, let's not do this right now.

1374
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:31,876
Let's take a minute and think it over.

1375
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:33,878
I don't need a minute.

1376
01:09:33,962 --> 01:09:37,506
I promised your dad
I'd always do what's best for you.

1377
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:38,925
This is best.

1378
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:44,388
So that's it?

1379
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:49,143
You ever need me, just beep.

1380
01:09:51,479 --> 01:09:52,646
Sandy.

1381
01:09:55,942 --> 01:09:56,943
Beep.

1382
01:09:58,737 --> 01:10:00,529
You're gonna be all right, Courtney.

1383
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:02,949
You're gonna be a legend.

1384
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:06,995
Brightest star out there.

1385
01:10:31,269 --> 01:10:35,481
Legend has it he stayed in that car
and cried for... six hours?

1386
01:10:40,528 --> 01:10:44,073
Someone called child services 'cause
they thought a little girl was in trouble.

1387
01:10:44,157 --> 01:10:45,158
- Yeah.
- In a car.

1388
01:10:49,829 --> 01:10:51,790
I mean, not that anybody has a good cry,

1389
01:10:51,873 --> 01:10:53,750
but his cry sounded
like some kind of, like,

1390
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,335
lonesome moose.

1391
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:04,761
Whatever the amount of time was
that he cried,

1392
01:11:04,844 --> 01:11:06,805
he broke his own rules.
He just got too close.

1393
01:11:06,888 --> 01:11:09,182
It was Alfred all over again.

1394
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,516
That was a tough time...

1395
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:18,441
'cause Sandy not only lost
his most talented client ever,

1396
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:22,195
but he also lost this person
he had feelings for.

1397
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,948
It must've been
especially painful for Sandy,

1398
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,366
because Courtney Clarke was everywhere.

1399
01:11:30,494 --> 01:11:31,495
Whoo!

1400
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,881

1406
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,777
Yeah, she's doing great. Uh...

1407
01:12:03,862 --> 01:12:06,114
We're not working together
anymore, though.

1408
01:12:07,198 --> 01:12:09,783
Oh. Now that makes sense.

1409
01:12:09,868 --> 01:12:11,160

01:12:11,244 --> 01:12:13,496
Yeah. That makes sense.

1411
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,875

1412

01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:51,885
What have we got here?

1428
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:57,391
Sandy!

1429
01:13:57,475 --> 01:13:59,518
I was scared you wouldn't come.

1430
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,398
Hey. Where's Peter? Is he doing PT?

1431
01:14:04,482 --> 01:14:07,651
Sandy, why don't you
take off your shoes?

1432
01:14:07,735 --> 01:14:10,238
Take off my... Oh, for your rug?

1433
01:14:10,321 --> 01:14:12,240
You know, my shoes are actually cleaner

1434
01:14:12,323 --> 01:14:14,867
than my socks, but...

1435
01:14:14,951 --> 01:14:16,369
And here we are.

1436
01:14:17,996 --> 01:14:19,956
- Hey, hey.
- And here's your throne.

1437
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,083
Why don't you sit down, Sandy?

1438
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,252
- Hey.
- What would you like to drink?

1439
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,462
You know, I got a bit of a sour stomach.

1440
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:30,633
If you got Dr. Brown's black cherry
diet, that would be perfect.

1441
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,638
Or a big glass of whiskey.
Either way is...

1442
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,399
Oh, look.

1443
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,734
Ah.

1444
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:56,700
Did you ever see
that naughty little movie, 9½ Weeks?

1445
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,119
No, I didn't.

1446
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,414
I saw Problem Child, though.
That kid was hysterical.

1447
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,586
Well, not as funny as that.
Look at you.

1448
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,465
- Peter's been sick for a long time.
- Yeah.

1449
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,927
And a woman yearns for a man's touch.

1450
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,138
Hey, no, that's natural.

1451
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,098
Are you a man, Sandy?

1452
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,975
I don't know. I...

1453
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,645
I was bar mitzvahed,
but that was a long time ago.

1454
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,567
- You know what I love about you?
- Yeah?

1455
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,860
Your voice.

1456
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,113
Come on. I've got a surprise.

1457
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:36,574
- Come along.
- Hey, what's this?

1458
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,951
- Just sit here. Now, sit.
- Oh! Oh, yeah.

1459
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,620
Aye, aye, aye! Yeah!

1460
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,497
Touch me, Sandy. Touch me.

1461
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,584
Well, I... I was just walking
on the carpet in my socks.

1462
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:51,630
- I don't wanna zap you.
- Oh. You can zap me. Just zap me.

1463
01:15:55,343 --> 01:15:57,095
Cindy!

1464
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:11,024
Don't worry about Peter.
He only wants my happiness.

1465
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:12,360
Yeah.

1466
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,410
I can't do it. I can't.

1467
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:23,954
- I'd feel better if we...
- Don't, Sandy, please.

1468
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:26,540
- Don't leave. Stay here.
- Oh...

1469
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,459
We... we could put a blanket
over his head.

1470
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:33,256
That's... that's actually a thought.

1471
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:36,008
No. He says no. He said... I'm sorry.

1472
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:39,220
I consider Peter a friend,

1473
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:43,141
whether he's alive or dead
or in a vegetative state.

1474
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,601
Thanks for the offer, okay?

1475
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:50,063
I got the shock! I knew I... The socks.

1476
01:16:57,405 --> 01:16:58,406
Pervert.

1477
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:04,870
- Cindy!
- Cindy!

1478
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,247
Madonna!

1479
01:17:06,330 --> 01:17:07,415
Melissa!

1480
01:17:08,291 --> 01:17:10,834
Wrapping up the CDs.

1481
01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,045
Doing too good a job. I feel that...

1482
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:18,091
Just... a little bit overzealous
with the wrapping is my feeling.

1483
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:21,470
What is the security on this thing?

1484
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,846
It's a $12 item.

1485
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,848
They got it wrapped up
like the Hope Diamond.

1486
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,768
It's impossible
that they have cellophane...

1487
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:32,022
What are you doing? You look gloomy.
Reiser's killing out there. Come on.

1488
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:34,775
You're like a monkey with a coconut.
You're just looking at it...

1489
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:37,653
He's killing the jokes that I wrote.
It should be me up there killing it.

1490
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:41,407
Next year, it will be.
CBS sees your jokes work now.

1491
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,327
Next year, you'll be telling those
jokes, 'cause you wrote 'em.

1492
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,209
You want me to do the jokes
he's telling right now

1493
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:52,293
on next year's Grammys?

1494
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,170
But you do 'em in your voice.

1495
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,672
But the punch lines are the same.
People have heard them already.

1496
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,299
You do new punch lines.

1497
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,509
So then they're new...
They're new jokes.

1498
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,761
No, but you're doing 'em in your voice.

1499
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,222
I wanna strangle you.

1500
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:05,806
- Don't say "your voice" again.
- What are you...

1501
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:07,558
I'm gonna kill you
if you say "in my voice."

1502
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,768
- Would you stop? I can't ever...
- Sandy?

1503
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:13,356
Courtney.

1504
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,359
Look at you!

1505
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,945
- Hey! Hey.
- Hey! Oh.

1506
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,618
You, uh, remember my, uh,
client Paul Reiser?

1507
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,746
- Kevin Connors.
- Kevin!

1508
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:31,540
They should have had you host this show.

1509
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:35,669
Paul Reiser is usually funny,
but his jokes tonight are just corny.

1510
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,673
- You still doing Atkins? I see.
- Atkins.

1511
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,467
- You look great!
- Thank you. Well, my God.

1512
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,135
- I look good? Look at you.
- You look so good!

1513
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,929
I have been following you.
You are doing so well.

1514
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:49,600
The Grammy tonight. Did I tell you
when that was gonna happen, huh?

1515
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,227
You deserve it all. You really do.

1516
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,605
You deserve it, too.
I wouldn't be here without you.

1517
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,775
Are you kidding me?
You cannot stop a shooting star.

1518
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,735
- Aw.
- Our scientists have proven this.

1519
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,321
You are unbelievable, Sandy.

1520
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,407
How's Bling? Where is he?

1521
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:07,660
Yeah, he's my label guy.
He's not my guy-guy anymore.

1522
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,079
- Well, I'm so sorry. That's...
- Don't be.

1523
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,998
Things happen for a reason.

1524
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,625
I scored us each a goodie bag, my sweet.

1525
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,960
- Hi, cuteness.
- Can I keep your PlayStation?

1526
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,296
Yes.

1527
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:24,009
Guys, this is my new boyfriend, Ra...
Say it for me, babe.

1528
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,511
Ramiro Alejandro.

1529
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:29,307
- Sandy Wexler.
- Nice to meet you, Ramir...

1530
01:19:29,390 --> 01:19:31,183
- Ramiro Alejandro.
- I know.

1531
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,395
Oh, is this the old Make-A-Wish guy
you were telling me about?

1532
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:37,105
No. No, we used to work together.

1533
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:40,150
Hey, you wanna come to Clive Davis'
after-party? You could ride with us.

1534
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:42,069
I, uh, would love to.

1535
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,405
- I, uh, have to go somewhere.
- Aw.

1536
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:47,491
A client of mine... Amy Baskin.
You... you remember Amy.

1537
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:48,576
Yeah!

1538
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:52,913
Yes, well, she got the lead in "Sound
of Music" at the Pasadena Playhouse.

1539
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:56,917
- She'll be Partygoer Number One.
- Yeah, that's the lead.

1540
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,545
It is. She's...
She's the lead partygoer.

1541
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,798
Let's get together real soon, Sandy.
Promise me.

1542
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,759
- I promise. You promise me this.
- Of course. What?

1543
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,177
- After Clive's party...
- Mmm-hmm.

1544
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,638
- ...you put on the ugly duckling hat...
- Oh, gosh.

1545
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,682
...and you remind yourself
where you came from.

1546
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,058
Not on this hair.

1547
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,143
- Like we... Nope, not on your hair.
- Courtney...

1548
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,729
- You promise?
- ...we have to go.

1549
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,522
- I promise. Okay.
- I gotta see you. Okay.

1550
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:20,399
Good to see you, babe.

1551
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,944
Nice meeting you, Sammy!
Hope they find a cure for you, buddy.

1552
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:25,821
Buddy, move. Move!

1553
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,656
- Get out the way!
- Which way are you moving?

1554
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,866
- Okay, go!
- Sandy, move! Sandy!

1555
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,743
That was another tough
goodbye for Sandy.

1556
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,121
He... he didn't even know if he would
ever see or talk to Courtney again.

1557
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,664
Of course he kept himself busy.

1558
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,249
He actually signed someone

1559
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,210
who was involved in the biggest form
of entertainment in the '90s.

1560
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:41,795
Wrestling. Professional wrestling.

1561
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:47,676
Yeah!

1562
01:20:56,935 --> 01:20:57,936
Yeah!

1563
01:21:07,446 --> 01:21:12,284
Go to sleep, baby!
It's night-night time!

1564
01:21:23,295 --> 01:21:25,005
- You're the man, Bedtime.
- Isn't he?

1565
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:26,757
Oh, I know you're gonna
take the title on Sunday.

1566
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,885
I'm gonna make 'em go night-night.

1567
01:21:30,969 --> 01:21:33,764
- Thank you.
- I'm gonna lose.

1568
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,724
You don't know that. Hang on, please.

1569
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:38,727
Yeah, I do know that. I got the script.

1570
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,440
Tsunami sits on my face until I tap out.
I'm never gonna be the champ.

1571
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:43,691
Okay, look.

1572
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:47,820
The good thing is, you're gonna have
a grown man sit on your face,

1573
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:51,156
and the entire world is gonna
be watching. That's a positive.

1574
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,325
- That's not a positive.
- It's a positive because it's...

1575
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,702
- The fame factor.
- What?

1576
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:57,955
Hey, Bedtime. Will you rock me like a baby
while my brother Dicky gets a picture?

1577
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,957
- What are you, six?
- Yeah, of course he will.

1578
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,167
- Of course he will do it.
- Do you see the size of this guy?

1579
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,293
Just get on it.

1580
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:07,297
Oh. Hang on, guys.
My cellular device is ringing.

1581
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:10,383
And I hit this, and I pull this.

1582
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:12,344
Wexler Artists.

1583
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,847
Mr. Wexler, it is
Chippy from Dan Tana's.

1584
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:19,685
Chippy! Hey! How's it going?
How was your vacation to Cincinnati?

1585
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,395
It was, uh, not a vacation.
My mother died.

1586
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,022
I went to Cincinnati for the funeral.

1587
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,358
Oh, yeah. That's right.
How's your mother?

1588
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,194
What are you calling for?

1589
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,990
We have a delicate situation with a client
of yours who has had too much to drink.

1590
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,826
And unfortunately,
there are very many paparazzi out front.

1591
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,204
Oh, boy. Was it Gary or Kevin?

1592
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,336
Yeah, I chased him
for six or seven blocks.

1593
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:50,173
Just come on. Get a life, guys. Jeez.

1594
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,223
- Bring me to the package.
- This way.

1595
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,026
Courtney?

1596
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,446
What the... What's going on, kiddo?

1597
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,324
Sandy! They found you!

1598
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,868
Yeah, they found me.

1599
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:21,288
You just stay put, okay?
You stay right there.

1600
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,462
Aw, Sandy to the rescue.

1601
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:32,675
No one can find out about this.
You understand me, Chippy? Not even you.

1602
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:34,885
Okay, Sandy.

1603
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:37,763
- Okay.
- Sandy!

1604
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:42,810
What? She'll suffocate?
Is that what you're saying?

1605
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:45,353
Courtney! Courtney! Courtney!

1606
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,314
Go jump in a lake, fellas!

1607
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:57,741
Ah! No, no, no, no! Oh, come on!
Oh, please, please, please.

1608
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:01,494
Keep your voices down. Let her sleep.

1609
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:06,625
That's right. Just sleep. Sleep, sleep.

1610
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,545
Let me get this up for you.

1611
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,131
And you... you're breathing.

1612
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,050
Are you breathing?

1613
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:17,761
Yeah, there it is. Okay.

1614
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:18,929
You'll be all right.

1615
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,893
I'm telling you, he's the best
ventriloquist in the business. He...

1616
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,436
You don't see him talking?

1617
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:31,441
No, you see his lips move slightly,
but that's not the important thing.

1618
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:34,069
The important thing
is what the guy is saying.

1619
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:37,197
No one looks at the lips
if they're laughing, then...

1620
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,949
No, kids love him.

1621
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:42,786
That's why I'm bringing it up
to you. The kids will love this guy.

1622
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,373
He's got curly hair,
and... and he's got the mustache.

1623
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:47,457
I'm sorry.

1624
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:50,502
- Linda, I'm... I'm just asking if you...
- Do you want some breakfast?

1625
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,504
- Sandy...
- If you could just

1626
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,547
put a good word in for me. That's it.

1627
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,717
Maybe put his headshot on his desk.

1628
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,136
- I really wish I could, Sandy.
- Hey, just meat, right?

1629
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,554
Oh, yeah. Hold on. Just meat.

1630
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,766
Just meet with him.

1631
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,852
That's all I'm asking you to do.
Just meet with him.

1632
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,103
All right, Sandy.

1633
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:11,564
Thank you, Linda! Thank you!

1634
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:13,525
Happy birthday on Wednesday.

1635
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,903
- How did you know that?
- Yeah, 'cause I know.

1636
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:18,238
'Cause I know. I know everything.

1637
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,618
How good is this? Phenomenal.

1638
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,662
No one knows
how to cook health food like...

1639
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:27,205
You're fantastic. You can do it all.

1640
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:31,293
I owe you for last night.
I'm embarrassed.

1641
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,462
Hey, everybody gets zonked
once in a while.

1642
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,924
The question is, why are we doing it?

1643
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,593
I don't know. I...

1644
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,594
I just broke up with Billy.

1645
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:45,432
Billy? Who's Billy?
What happened to the Marc Anthony fella?

1646
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,059
Marc Anthony? Come on, Sandy.

1647
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,687
Pick up a People magazine
every once in a while.

1648
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,855
That was three boyfriends ago.

1649
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:55,525
Oh, hey, I gotta start writing
some of these names down.

1650
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:58,737
I'm getting lost.
I'm joking around with you.

1651
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,239
What you're doing's perfectly natural.

1652
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,742
Anyone in your position
would be doing the same.

1653
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,160
Look, Liza did it.

1654
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:08,956
Elizabeth Taylor did it.
Sherwood Schwartz did it.

1655
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,583
Just my life.

1656
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:14,419
It feels out of control.

1657
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:18,882
I can't connect with anybody.
I don't... I just don't feel safe.

1658
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:20,926
I can't even go ten feet

1659
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:25,806
without the paparazzi following me,
taking pictures of me, spying on me.

1660
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,390
I don't even want to
leave my house anymore.

1661
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,101
What? You gotta leave your house.

1662
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:32,062
Even Michael Jackson
leaves his house once in a while.

1663
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:33,647
How?

1664
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:36,734
He just don't look like Michael Jackson.

1665
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,655
Excuse me, sir.
You know what time it is?

1666
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,160
Can you do me a favor?

1667
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:50,789
Courtney Clarke was just in there.
Uh, could you find out where she went?

1668
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,625
This is...
Somebody just got their life back!

1669
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,378
...Why do you own this stuff?

1670
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,839
Why? Those are my workout clothes.

1671
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,799
You work out?

1672
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:04,928
Suzanne Somers personally gave me
one of the very first ThighMasters.

1673
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:06,263
I use it as much as I can.

1674
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,015
This conversation is over.

1675
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,392
What? It's for firm thighs and buttocks.

1676
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,936
- Sandy, please stop talking.
- All right.

1677
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:14,772
What we gonna do today?

1678
01:27:14,855 --> 01:27:17,733
What we gonna do today?
Anything you want, kiddo.

1679
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:20,861
- Okay, lead the way, ThighMaster.
- Hey! Now, wait a minute.

1680
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:23,864
- By the way, the dogs are good for cardio.
- Oh.

1681
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:25,908
What does that mean?

1682
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:27,159
You'll see.

1683
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,995
- Go! Run! Run! Run!
- Okay! Okay!

1684
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,581
Well, here comes the test.

1685
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:37,585
Look at that. Look at that. Huh?

1686
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,254
...Wow.

1687
01:27:40,798 --> 01:27:42,215
Why am I golfing?

1688
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,134
Golfing is very relaxing.

1689
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:47,512
You don't have to think
about nothing but smacking that ball.

1690
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,306
Have you ever played before?

1691
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:52,225
- No.
- No? It's quite easy.

1692
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:55,687
I'll take out the big stick
'cause it's fun to hit 'em far.

1693
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:59,316
It's always good to warm up a little bit.
Ow! Okay.

1694
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:02,235
I got actually a little problem
in the back.

1695
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,696
- You okay?
- Yeah. Just give me one sec.

1696
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,781
God damn it.

1697
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:07,699
- Should I call for help?
- No, I'll be all right.

1698
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,993
Just give me one sec.
I just gotta stretch.

1699
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:14,915
All right. Just give me one more sec.
I do need help.

1700
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:23,631
You need to go to the bathroom?

1701
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:26,259
No, I'm just... I'm getting it lined up.

1702
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,931
Let's just say goodbye
to all our troubles, okay?

1703
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,015
Okay.

1704
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:35,102
If you got any problems, put 'em
into the ball and send them away.

1705
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:40,357
Is it supposed to curve
off to the right like that?

1706
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,609
Yeah, I was playing a dogleg right.

1707
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:44,402
- A dogleg?
- Right.

1708
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:47,489
You gotta bend it around the trees,
and that's what I was going for.

1709
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,657
- Can I try it?
- You wanna try? Okay.

1710
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,701
I was gonna show you
a little more, but okay.

1711
01:28:51,784 --> 01:28:53,370
- Okay.
- So let me...

1712
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,163
You know, maybe you should
tee it up for yourself.

1713
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,539
Tee it up. Here.

1714
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:59,001
- You tee it up, and you say goodbye.
- Right here.

1715
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,085
Okay.

1716
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,045
And just have a good time
and don't worry about where it goes.

1717
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:03,839
- Let's see.
- Okay.

1718
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:11,179
Am I being hustled right now?
What was that?

1719
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:15,350
I swear I didn't play every day growing up
with my Uncle Davey who's a golf pro.

1720
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:17,227
Oh, well...

1721
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,855
Does this guy need a manager because...

1722
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,773
- Come over here.
- What are we doing?

1723
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,108
We gotta work on that slice leg.

1724
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,692
- Oh, my God.
- Here you go. Here you go.

1725
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,904
- This is your day. I don't want to...
- No. No, no, no. You got it?

1726
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:29,322
- You're okay with it?
- Oh, it's my day now. Come on.

1727
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:30,615
- In the hips.
- In the hips.

1728
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:31,699
Here we go.

1729
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,494
Oh! All right! Hold on now.

1730
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,705
Huh? I beg your pardon?

1731
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:38,790
Tell me. Tell me.

1732
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,000
A company called Pixar...

1733
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,334
- Pixar?
- ...wants me to do a voice

1734
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:43,545
in some animated movie
about a bunch of toys.

1735
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,005
Cartoons are dead.

1736
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:46,589
Tell 'em pass.

1737
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:49,176
- Okay. Sandy knows best.
- I mean, come on. I do know best.

1738
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:53,555
The lady at Chili's said they'll keep it
open till 10:30 for us, so that's good.

1739
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:54,973
How you feeling anyway?

1740
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:56,141
As good as anybody can feel

1741
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,393
knowing they're about to get
their face sat on by that guy.

1742
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:00,562
Damn, that's a big ass!

1743
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,272
- That's right...
- Get off me!

1744
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:05,442
Listen. Will you just trust me?
This is a good night for you.

1745
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,651
Trust you? It's humiliating.

1746
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,446
My kids are out there, man!
My wife might not ever kiss me again!

1747
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:12,490
Randy Savage had to get whooped 24 times

1748
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,868
before he finally pinned Ted DiBiase
to win the belt, man!

1749
01:30:15,953 --> 01:30:18,455
How does your platinum-selling ass
know about wrestling history?

1750
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,708
I'm from Alaska.
It was either watch wrestling or fish.

1751
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,376
Is that adorable?

1752
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:26,379
Will you just take it all in
and promise me you'll have fun?

1753
01:30:26,463 --> 01:30:28,923
This is a big night for you.
Look at me.

1754
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,593
Man, how does your goofy ass
have me feeling good right now?

1755
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:32,677
That's impossible!

1756
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,472
Because you know I love ya
and I'm your family.

1757
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:37,224
All right, good luck.

1758
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:38,641
Get out there!

1759
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,647
Yeah! Come on!

1760
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:55,908
Fight!

1761
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,288
Okay.

1762
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:17,847
No!

1763
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:26,064
Break, break, break, break!

1764
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,817
Hey, what are you doing?
Stick to the script.

1765
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,736
I'm sorry, Tsunami.
You're gonna have to earn this one.

1766
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,030
What? Hey...

1767
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,952
This is bullshit.
I'm supposed to win.

1768
01:31:40,037 --> 01:31:42,622
This happening?
Huh, this is happening?

1769
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:43,790
Well, bring it on!

1770
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:51,839
Okay, get back there, champ!

1771
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,636
There it is. Now it's getting real.

1772
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:02,016
Thank you very much!

1773
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:07,439
What is this?

1774
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:17,532
No, you're not! What's going on here?

1775
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:27,917
Say it!

1776
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,212
It's time to go night-night!

1777
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,151
- I got the belt! I'm the champ!
- You the man! You the man!

1778
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:56,028
- Sandy! How?
- What do you... Huh?

1779
01:32:56,613 --> 01:33:01,784
The referee is a client, and
Wexler Artists look out for each other.

1780
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:04,078
Oh, man!
Those guys are gonna fire his ass!

1781
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:05,705
Of course they are,

1782
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:09,667
but I already got him a job as a referee
for the Harlem Globetrotters.

1783
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:12,086
- I know. I understand.
- You're never going to work again!

1784
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,547
What do you say, champ? Proud of ya.

1785
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:18,135
Oh! I'm so happy, Sandy!

1786
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:21,721
I love you. This is your moment.
This is all you.

1787
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:24,432
I'm just so happy for you
and your wife and your kids.

1788
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:25,767
Okay? That's all I want.

1789
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,186
- I love you! I love you!
- You deserve everything!

1790
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,980
- Courtney, get in here!
- You deserve everything!

1791
01:33:31,063 --> 01:33:32,774
Uh, we do have to go to Chili's, though.

1792
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,527
I told the lady we'd be there
by 10:30, so let's get going.

1793
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,112
- Why are you talking about Chili's now?
- I just don't wanna...

1794
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,324
I don't want her to screw us
for the next time, you know. Let's go.

1795
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:57,965
Eat up those baby backs, guys.

1796
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:04,806
How do you take care of everybody
and never worry about yourself?

1797
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,767
How do you become Sandy?

1798
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,394
Oh, well, listen.

1799
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:13,064
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
Practice, practice, practice.

1800
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,774
- Hmm.
- Huh?

1801
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,779
I wish I could stay here.

1802
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:22,657
This is the best day I've had in years.

1803
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:27,119
Listen, you can stay
as long as you want.

1804
01:34:28,205 --> 01:34:30,373
I'm supposed to go to New York tomorrow

1805
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:33,418
and shoot this VH1 thing
with Lenny Kravitz.

1806
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,169
Yeah?

1807
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:37,755
That's a good thing.

1808
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,841
Is it?

1809
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:42,719
Then why don't I wanna go?

1810
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:49,767
Tell me I don't have to go, Sandy.

1811
01:34:51,728 --> 01:34:53,355
No, no, no.

1812
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:55,898
Why won't you?

1813
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,902
'Cause that's not my job anymore.

1814
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,447
Okay.

1815
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,782
What do you want me to do?

1816
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:12,457
What I want you to do
is concentrate on your career.

1817
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,208
Music comes first.

1818
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,003
Go to New York.

1819
01:35:21,508 --> 01:35:24,135
- You know what?
- What?

1820
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,555
You're a jerk.

1821
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:39,150
Oh, God, yes!

1822
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,819
What was that?

1823
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:45,031
- Firuz!
- Oh, all right, then.

1824
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,824
I'll go take a walk or something.

1825
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,661
Have the best night of your life, Sandy.

1826
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:52,246
I'm trying.

1827
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:57,001
Ultimately, I have to move.

1828
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:37,834
The day was perfect,
the night was better.

1829
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:40,420
Thank you. I'm off to New York.

1830
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:42,339
Sandy knows best.

1831
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:43,673
Love, Court.

1832
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:54,100
- Pick that up!
- Shut up, Firuz!

1833
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:58,980
Just shut up.

1834
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:00,732
Success can be really lonely.

1835
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:03,443
That's why you kinda long
for someone to share it with.

1836
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,028
So a week later,
her and Lenny Kravitz moved in together.

1837
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:08,698
And then two weeks later after that,
moved out.

1838
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,116
And she moved on to Johnny Depp.

1839
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:11,409
- Chris Cornell.
- George Clooney.

1840
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:13,327
- Ziggy Marley.
- Pauly Shore.

1841
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:15,037
I went out with her?

1842
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:17,415
Man, Sandy was messed up.

1843
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,418
Sir, are you committing suicide?

1844
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:22,504
'Cause I don't think
I'm allowed to film that!

1845
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:24,213
No, I'm not!

1846
01:37:24,296 --> 01:37:26,466
I'm fine, thank you very much!

1847
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:30,302
She can date whoever she wants to date!
That's her thing!

1848
01:37:30,387 --> 01:37:32,930
- He's talking to me.
- He's talking to you?

1849
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:43,232
Sandy, that pool looks far away.
How long until my skin starts burning?

1850
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:49,155
I think the safety advisor
said four seconds you get

1851
01:37:49,238 --> 01:37:50,990
before you must be wet.

1852
01:37:51,073 --> 01:37:52,825
You think he said that
or he said that? Four?

1853
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:56,120
I got to admit, I haven't been sleeping.
I'm just so tired.

1854
01:37:56,203 --> 01:37:57,872
I don't care. I'm about
to be lit on fire!

1855
01:37:57,955 --> 01:38:00,332
He said it! He said what he said.

1856
01:38:00,417 --> 01:38:04,336
Okay, here we go. Right calf first.

1857
01:38:04,421 --> 01:38:06,589
Okay. Okay.

1858
01:38:06,672 --> 01:38:09,008
- Okay!
- Okay, go, go, go!

1859
01:38:09,092 --> 01:38:10,968
Whoo! Yeah!

1860
01:38:12,386 --> 01:38:14,346
...What? Oh!

1861
01:38:15,097 --> 01:38:16,641
No!

1862
01:38:19,351 --> 01:38:21,145
No!

1863
01:38:22,146 --> 01:38:25,900
Okay. So birds sleep at night,
but the bats wake up.

1864
01:38:25,983 --> 01:38:27,569
Okay.

1865
01:38:27,652 --> 01:38:30,947
Now we know. Now we know.
No, this is a good thing.

1866
01:38:34,951 --> 01:38:37,286
I'm telling you, Bud,
he can follow anybody.

1867
01:38:37,369 --> 01:38:40,540
He can follow... He followed Minnie
at The Ice House recently.

1868
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:44,376
I know you don't like The Ice House.
I don't know why I said that. I'm sorry.

1869
01:38:44,461 --> 01:38:46,128
All right, I'm gonna go watch Kevin.

1870
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:48,673
- Hey, Sandy.
- Kirby.

1871
01:38:48,756 --> 01:38:49,757
You got a minute?

1872
01:38:49,841 --> 01:38:52,635
Yeah, I'm going to watch
my client on stage.

1873
01:38:52,719 --> 01:38:55,387
Actually, Kevin and I think
it's time for a change.

1874
01:38:55,472 --> 01:38:56,931
He's dumping me through you?

1875
01:38:57,014 --> 01:38:59,601
You gotta admit, you've been
a bit clingy. I'm telling ya.

1876
01:38:59,684 --> 01:39:01,018
You're telling me? I'm telling you.

1877
01:39:01,102 --> 01:39:02,186
So we agree.

1878
01:39:03,605 --> 01:39:07,233
Bud, Alex, how are you guys?
Good to see you.

1879
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:09,318
It's all happening
here tonight, isn't it?

1880
01:39:15,116 --> 01:39:19,161
♪ You give me butterfly, butterflies ♪

1881
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:21,372
♪ Down in my soul ♪

1882
01:39:22,081 --> 01:39:24,125
♪ Butterflies, butterfly ♪

1883
01:39:24,876 --> 01:39:26,628
Why the hell do you
have me singing that song?

1884
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:28,379
- They hated it!
- No.

1885
01:39:28,462 --> 01:39:29,922
This is an awful idea, Sandy!

1886
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:33,217
No, I... I'm telling you,
you did better than you think!

1887
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:36,262
- You are out of your mind!
- No! No!

1888
01:39:36,345 --> 01:39:37,805
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.

1889
01:39:37,889 --> 01:39:40,016
- It's time you go night-night.
- No night-night! No!

1890
01:39:40,099 --> 01:39:42,434
- You're fired.
- Oh, God! Come on!

1891
01:39:42,519 --> 01:39:45,897
No! You can't do that to me! Aah!

1892
01:39:48,566 --> 01:39:50,234
We're done, Sandy. We're done!

1893
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:51,402
Don't say that.

1894
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:58,576
Your life is an adventure.

1895
01:39:58,660 --> 01:40:00,286
You don't want to miss a single moment.

1896
01:40:00,369 --> 01:40:03,414
- This girl's the new Grace Kelly.
- Now, you don't have to.

1897
01:40:03,497 --> 01:40:07,835
Vag-Eze, America's number one
vaginal discharge ointment.

1898
01:40:07,919 --> 01:40:10,672
Side effects include dryness,
burning, itching, fallopian tube...

1899
01:40:10,755 --> 01:40:13,591
- What's vaginal discharge?
- Can I have some?

1900
01:40:14,175 --> 01:40:17,094
You said it was
a coffee commercial, Sandy!

1901
01:40:18,971 --> 01:40:21,140
What the hell is going on here?

1902
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:28,064
Please, God, I need a miracle.

1903
01:40:38,282 --> 01:40:44,789
"Remember, kids,
if you laugh when you are blue,

1904
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:46,958
the sun...

1905
01:40:47,041 --> 01:40:50,127
...will always shine on you.

1906
01:40:51,420 --> 01:40:54,298
Honk, honk.

1907
01:40:55,883 --> 01:40:58,469
Mr. Buttons."

1908
01:41:29,250 --> 01:41:30,251
Teddy!

1909
01:41:31,794 --> 01:41:35,256
Wonderful news. Mr. Buttons is dead!

1910
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:38,259
You killed him?

1911
01:41:38,342 --> 01:41:41,470
No! He hung himself!

1912
01:41:41,553 --> 01:41:44,641
- Really?
- His time slot's open, guys.

1913
01:41:44,724 --> 01:41:46,267
I got you the audition.

1914
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:48,853
It doesn't feel right.
I mean, I feel bad for the guy.

1915
01:41:48,936 --> 01:41:50,938
Screw Mr. Buttons! It's our turn!

1916
01:41:51,022 --> 01:41:55,109
- He couldn't take the pressure.
- He took the coward's way out.

1917
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:59,446
I gotta tell you, it's the first time
I... I agree with the puppets.

1918
01:42:03,575 --> 01:42:06,203
Friend Boom Boom is gonna
sing a song for us today, kids.

1919
01:42:06,287 --> 01:42:07,830
Would you like that?
Would you like to hear it?

1920
01:42:09,623 --> 01:42:10,875
I hate singing.

1921
01:42:10,958 --> 01:42:13,419
What are you talking about?
You sing all the time.

1922
01:42:13,502 --> 01:42:15,838
You sing in the car,
you sing in the shower...

1923
01:42:15,922 --> 01:42:17,674
You spy on me in the shower?

1924
01:42:19,133 --> 01:42:22,178
- That is not what I meant.
- I can sing, Ted.

1925
01:42:22,261 --> 01:42:25,431
- Would you like to hear that, kids?
- Yeah!

1926
01:42:31,478 --> 01:42:33,189
You have something
in your throat, Heather?

1927
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:34,565
Yeah, your hand, dummy!

1928
01:42:38,485 --> 01:42:41,030
I can't believe it.
These kids are eating your boy up!

1929
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:42,573
I mean, he could be the next Buttons.

1930
01:42:42,656 --> 01:42:44,909
- Didn't I tell you? Didn't I say?
- Yeah, great.

1931
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:47,536
Hey! There's a caterpillar on your face.

1932
01:42:48,788 --> 01:42:50,372
What's with you?
What, are you okay?

1933
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:53,084
- No, no, I, uh...
- Something wrong? There's something wrong?

1934
01:42:53,167 --> 01:42:56,462
Maybe a little dizzy.
I had too many bacon bits this morning.

1935
01:42:56,545 --> 01:42:59,548
Bacon Bits? What is that?
That's a dog food, no?

1936
01:42:59,631 --> 01:43:01,801
No. Didn't say that on the box.

1937
01:43:01,884 --> 01:43:05,346
Yeah, all right, whatever. Tell you what,
you come to my office in an hour.

1938
01:43:05,429 --> 01:43:06,889
We'll hammer out a deal.

1939
01:43:06,973 --> 01:43:10,059
I'll get your boy on the air ASAP.
Okay, bud?

1940
01:43:10,142 --> 01:43:13,062
All righty. That makes me very happy.

1941
01:43:15,606 --> 01:43:17,316
They absolutely loved you.

1942
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:19,902
- You're getting the job, Teddy.
- I did good. I did good.

1943
01:43:19,986 --> 01:43:23,697
My only fear is they're gonna try
to lowball you on the deal, all right?

1944
01:43:23,781 --> 01:43:26,242
The key to this meeting is tough talk.

1945
01:43:26,909 --> 01:43:30,913
These TV jerks only respond
to bullying and aggression.

1946
01:43:30,997 --> 01:43:33,540
Well, I'll let you
handle all that, okay?

1947
01:43:35,001 --> 01:43:38,545
I'm no doctor,
but Sandy look like crap on a stick.

1948
01:43:38,629 --> 01:43:40,172
No, I'm fine.

1949
01:43:40,256 --> 01:43:42,674
- Sandy!
- No.

1950
01:43:42,759 --> 01:43:44,718
I think he's having a heart attack.

1951
01:43:44,802 --> 01:43:47,679
We... we gotta get you to a hospital.
Boom Boom, call an ambulance!

1952
01:43:47,764 --> 01:43:54,186
No, Boom Boom. First meeting,
close deal, then hop-ital.

1953
01:43:54,270 --> 01:43:56,438
Forget the meeting.
You can barely speak.

1954
01:43:57,064 --> 01:44:00,401
But... you can.

1955
01:44:03,863 --> 01:44:07,950
So what we saw in there
told us everything we need to know.

1956
01:44:08,617 --> 01:44:11,412
We love Ted. The kids love Ted.

1957
01:44:11,495 --> 01:44:13,122
That is... That's spectacular.

1958
01:44:13,205 --> 01:44:14,748
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1959
01:44:14,832 --> 01:44:17,919
But the fact is
he's never been on television.

1960
01:44:18,002 --> 01:44:19,670
So here's the deal.

1961
01:44:19,753 --> 01:44:24,801
Six episodes, 15 grand a pop,
and then we see what we do from there.

1962
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:33,350
Are you kidding me, Marty?

1963
01:44:34,601 --> 01:44:38,189
- What?
- You think I'm a complete a-hole?

1964
01:44:38,272 --> 01:44:39,648
No, no, no.

1965
01:44:39,731 --> 01:44:42,193
Then why are you treating me like one?

1966
01:44:42,776 --> 01:44:45,529
I think it's a reasonable
starting place, Sandy.

1967
01:44:47,239 --> 01:44:50,617
Reasonable, Fishbein? It's dog crap.

1968
01:44:51,202 --> 01:44:52,536
If we take this deal,

1969
01:44:52,619 --> 01:44:56,833
my guy's gonna end up at the end of
a rope just like your last clown.

1970
01:44:57,458 --> 01:44:59,668
- Whoa, man!
- All right. Sandy, Sandy. Take it easy.

1971
01:44:59,751 --> 01:45:02,546
Take it easy. Just make us a counter.

1972
01:45:03,923 --> 01:45:07,969
We want a two year...
Five year deal.

1973
01:45:08,052 --> 01:45:09,136
Sandy, please.

1974
01:45:09,220 --> 01:45:13,057
Twenty-four show minimum,
50 grand an episode,

1975
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:17,728
with a 200K bump
every year we're on the air.

1976
01:45:18,395 --> 01:45:20,022
This guy's an animal.

1977
01:45:20,106 --> 01:45:21,648
He's literally foaming at the mouth.

1978
01:45:21,732 --> 01:45:24,818
And the puppets get
their own dressing rooms.

1979
01:45:27,113 --> 01:45:28,197
Just kidding.

1980
01:45:29,365 --> 01:45:30,491
Okay.

1981
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:34,703
Three years, 20 show minimum,
at the numbers you mentioned.

1982
01:45:35,746 --> 01:45:36,788
Deal.

1983
01:45:36,873 --> 01:45:40,584
Ted, welcome to the UPN family.

1984
01:45:46,798 --> 01:45:52,304
And that's how Sandy died.
On the conference room floor at UPN.

1985
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:55,975
Just kidding.
They took him to the hospital.

1986
01:45:57,434 --> 01:45:58,853
Where am I?

1987
01:45:58,936 --> 01:46:01,898
You had a minor heart attack.
A warning shot.

1988
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:05,109
Probably due to stress. And meat.

1989
01:46:05,192 --> 01:46:08,237
Just need to rest for a few days.
Here you go.

1990
01:46:13,700 --> 01:46:18,872
This is too nice of a room for me.
I can't afford this.

1991
01:46:18,956 --> 01:46:23,002
Come on, man. I wasn't gonna let you
slum it down in the regular people ward.

1992
01:46:23,085 --> 01:46:25,796
First class all the way for my Sandman.

1993
01:46:25,879 --> 01:46:28,340
- You came!
- Of course.

1994
01:46:28,424 --> 01:46:30,842
Miss Clarke, I love your new album.

1995
01:46:30,927 --> 01:46:32,511
I play it every day.
I'm obsessed with it.

1996
01:46:32,594 --> 01:46:33,595
Thank you.

1997
01:46:33,679 --> 01:46:34,888
- You're so beautiful.
- Thank you.

1998
01:46:34,972 --> 01:46:37,016
Can I touch you?

1999
01:46:38,767 --> 01:46:41,395
Oh, I... I...
I just touched the queen!

2000
01:46:41,478 --> 01:46:45,357
Oh, and you, sir, you need a new bedpan,
so I'm gonna grab that for you.

2001
01:46:45,441 --> 01:46:48,319
- I used the bedpan while I was sleeping?
- Thanks.

2002
01:46:49,903 --> 01:46:51,822
You did a new album?

2003
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:55,534
Oh. Don't you worry about that. I want
you to worry about getting better.

2004
01:46:56,243 --> 01:46:59,371
It's scary, knowing
your heart's not good.

2005
01:46:59,455 --> 01:47:04,668
Sandy Wexler, you have
the biggest, best, strongest heart

2006
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:08,422
in this whole miserable town.
And that's a fact.

2007
01:47:08,505 --> 01:47:10,216
Miserable town?

2008
01:47:10,299 --> 01:47:13,594
It's been quite nice to you,
thank you very much.

2009
01:47:13,677 --> 01:47:14,971
I guess.

2010
01:47:15,054 --> 01:47:17,264
I just feel like I need a change,
you know?

2011
01:47:19,016 --> 01:47:20,892
So I'm moving to Seattle.

2012
01:47:20,977 --> 01:47:23,895
Seattle? What are you talking about?

2013
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:30,277
That whole grunge thing, that's old hat.
Why would you go there?

2014
01:47:31,195 --> 01:47:34,865
The guy I'm marrying lives there.

2015
01:47:37,743 --> 01:47:39,328
You're getting married?

2016
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:42,498
Yeah.

2017
01:47:42,581 --> 01:47:44,750
Saturday, in Malibu.

2018
01:47:44,833 --> 01:47:48,462
His name is Eric Lamonsoff.
He's not in show business.

2019
01:47:48,545 --> 01:47:50,964
He owns a chain of coffee stores.

2020
01:47:51,048 --> 01:47:54,593
A store that just sells coffee?
I don't know.

2021
01:47:54,676 --> 01:47:56,720
That ain't gonna work, kid.

2022
01:47:57,554 --> 01:48:00,557
I just need a... a break from the music.

2023
01:48:01,142 --> 01:48:05,021
But singing's the only thing
that makes you happy.

2024
01:48:05,104 --> 01:48:08,357
Yeah, but I'm looking for something else
to make me happy.

2025
01:48:10,484 --> 01:48:11,902
'Cause that's not it anymore.

2026
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:18,784
Miss Clarke, I'm so sorry to bother you,
but would you?

2027
01:48:18,867 --> 01:48:20,119
Sure.

2028
01:48:20,202 --> 01:48:22,913
Is that the record? Can you play it?

2029
01:48:22,996 --> 01:48:25,041
- Is there a player in the room?
- Yeah.

2030
01:48:26,083 --> 01:48:27,959
I gotta hear this.

2031
01:48:34,841 --> 01:48:36,718
You were always there for me.

2032
01:48:39,430 --> 01:48:40,764
Even when you weren't.

2033
01:48:49,606 --> 01:48:50,982
Goodbye, Sandy.

This guy's butchering it.

2054
01:50:19,780 --> 01:50:20,864
Alfred?

2055
01:50:22,241 --> 01:50:24,993
Wow. Nobody's called me that in years.

2056
01:50:25,994 --> 01:50:27,329
Good to see you, Sandy.

2057
01:50:27,413 --> 01:50:30,081
Hey, what are you doing here?

2058
01:50:30,166 --> 01:50:32,626
Well, this is where
I get all my best ideas.

2059
01:50:32,709 --> 01:50:34,127
Well, here and the radio.

2060
01:50:34,211 --> 01:50:36,922
Yeah, you... you've been on such a roll.

2061
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:40,842
From "My Bologna"
to "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi."

2062
01:50:40,926 --> 01:50:42,969
Just great. Clever stuff.

2063
01:50:43,053 --> 01:50:45,681
Oh, thanks, man. Well, you know,
you're the one who put it all together.

2064
01:50:45,764 --> 01:50:47,724
...Remember what you told me?

2065
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:49,268
- Stick with the accordion.
- Uh-huh.

2066
01:50:49,351 --> 01:50:51,270
Only wear Hawaiian shirts.

2067
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:54,022
Do funny words to other people's songs.

2068
01:50:54,105 --> 01:50:55,399
- Genius.
- Huh?

2069
01:50:55,482 --> 01:50:59,611
I'm glad. I'm glad it all worked out
for you. I really am. Sincerely.

2070
01:50:59,695 --> 01:51:03,490
Thank you, man. Well, I'm just sorry
that we couldn't have done it together.

2071
01:51:04,074 --> 01:51:05,992
Hey, listen. I got too close.

2072
01:51:06,076 --> 01:51:08,745
Our friendship was getting
in the way of our business.

2073
01:51:08,829 --> 01:51:10,706
You did what you had to do.

2074
01:51:10,789 --> 01:51:13,834
Wait a minute.
Is that what you think happened?

2075
01:51:13,917 --> 01:51:15,168
That is what happened.

2076
01:51:15,252 --> 01:51:17,921
- You thought we got too close?
- Yeah.

2077
01:51:18,004 --> 01:51:20,632
- No, Sandy.
- That's not why I left you.

2078
01:51:20,716 --> 01:51:24,052
I left you because you
could never tell me the truth.

2079
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,347
What? That's ridiculous!

2080
01:51:26,430 --> 01:51:29,015
Tell me one time
I didn't tell you the truth.

2081
01:51:30,434 --> 01:51:33,061
You told me we could copyright
the word "weird."

2082
01:51:33,144 --> 01:51:36,857
No, I said it was weird
that we couldn't copyright it.

2083
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:39,651
You... Come on. You were hearing
what you want to hear.

2084
01:51:39,735 --> 01:51:42,070
Sandy, you tell people
what you think they want to hear.

2085
01:51:42,153 --> 01:51:44,656
- I don't agree.
- No, look.

2086
01:51:44,740 --> 01:51:50,537
For me, if you really care about
someone, you tell 'em the truth.

2087
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:01,047
You're right, Alfred.

2088
01:52:02,508 --> 01:52:04,426
Damn it, you're 100% right.

2089
01:52:05,969 --> 01:52:08,972
- Your hair looks good, by the way.
- Thanks, man, I...

2090
01:52:09,848 --> 01:52:13,310
- You're lying again.
- I am. It looks like dirty spaghetti.

2091
01:52:13,394 --> 01:52:16,062
I gotta stop. I'm gonna stop!

2092
01:52:16,146 --> 01:52:18,023
- I'm gonna stop, Alfred.
- You should.

2093
01:52:22,403 --> 01:52:25,614
Hey! Hey! You suck!

2094
01:52:25,697 --> 01:52:28,284
You know what?
Real funny, Weird Al.

2095
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:32,371
Why don't you make me laugh one time
without using somebody else's music?

2096
01:52:32,454 --> 01:52:33,580
Get off of me.

2097
01:52:34,831 --> 01:52:38,168
I'd like to book a space
for a private event.

2098
01:52:38,251 --> 01:52:42,714
No! No! Don't tell me it's impossible!
Everything's negotiable!

2099
01:52:48,304 --> 01:52:51,515
Put it on your calendar, Ted.
Okay? Don't be late.

2100
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:53,058
I think we'll be busy.

2101
01:52:53,141 --> 01:52:54,435
- I'm not talking to you.
- Hey!

2102
01:52:54,518 --> 01:52:55,644
I'm talking to Ted!

2103
01:52:55,727 --> 01:52:57,938
- Okay. We'll be there.
- What's his problem?

2104
01:52:58,021 --> 01:52:59,773
I don't know. Just do what he says.

2105
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:12,786
It's an international call,
so talk fast, okay?

2106
01:53:13,537 --> 01:53:14,746
Can I count on you?

2107
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:16,790
Perfect.

2108
01:53:16,873 --> 01:53:18,709
And you have a valid driver's license?

2109
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:24,631
How am I looking?

2110
01:53:24,715 --> 01:53:26,174
You actually look good, Sandy.

2111
01:53:26,257 --> 01:53:27,759
That surprises you?

2112
01:53:32,263 --> 01:53:34,891
- Courtney, your limo is here.
- It's showtime, girl.

2113
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:37,519
Wow. Um, it's early.
I'll be right down, guys.

2114
01:53:48,071 --> 01:53:50,366
It's a big day, Miss Courtney Clarke.

2115
01:53:51,282 --> 01:53:52,618
The biggest.

2116
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:55,328
- You look very beautiful.
- Thanks.

2117
01:53:55,412 --> 01:53:56,747
How is traffic out there?

2118
01:53:56,830 --> 01:54:00,166
Traffic's not a problem.
You sit back, relax.

2119
01:54:03,462 --> 01:54:05,422
Let Firuz take good care of you.

2120
01:54:09,926 --> 01:54:12,303
Sir, I think you missed our turn.

2121
01:54:12,388 --> 01:54:13,764
No, no, no, no.

2122
01:54:13,847 --> 01:54:15,891
That was a thing that on purpose I did.

2123
01:54:16,558 --> 01:54:18,935
We're going shortcut.

2124
01:54:37,746 --> 01:54:39,540
What are we doing here?

2125
01:54:39,623 --> 01:54:41,917
Please, miss, go inside.

2126
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:44,545
I'm going inside to call the police.

2127
01:55:21,372 --> 01:55:22,416
Sandy?

2128
01:55:23,459 --> 01:55:26,503
Just you and me
under the stars again, kid.

2129
01:55:26,587 --> 01:55:30,340
- Yeah, but now's not exactly a good time.
- I know.

2130
01:55:30,424 --> 01:55:35,512
And I have no right to say to you what I'm
gonna say, but I'm gonna do it anyway.

2131
01:55:36,888 --> 01:55:39,516
You like making trouble,
don't you, Sandy?

2132
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:41,727
Look, here's the thing.

2133
01:55:41,810 --> 01:55:46,773
Maybe sometimes I got a way of telling
people what I think they want to hear,

2134
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:49,735
rather than what I'm really thinking.

2135
01:55:49,818 --> 01:55:53,989
So I was thinking, if I started
saying the stuff that I think,

2136
01:55:54,698 --> 01:55:58,368
maybe I'm gonna find out that's actually
what the people wanted to hear.

2137
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:01,246
Oh, shit, Sandy.
You mixed up your pills.

2138
01:56:01,913 --> 01:56:05,917
What I'm trying to say is this
Eric Lamonsoff guy is wrong for you.

2139
01:56:06,001 --> 01:56:10,171
Just like Bling was the wrong guy
and Lenny Kravitz.

2140
01:56:10,255 --> 01:56:14,843
Marc Anthony. And Prince.
And Apollonia.

2141
01:56:15,426 --> 01:56:18,429
Dennis Rodman,
who's great on the boards, but...

2142
01:56:18,514 --> 01:56:20,682
You dated Dennis Rodman?
Good Lord.

2143
01:56:21,725 --> 01:56:23,143
Dad, what are you doing here?

2144
01:56:23,226 --> 01:56:25,395
Sandy's gettin' to that part.
You just listen.

2145
01:56:25,479 --> 01:56:27,105
Yeah, thank you, Willy.

2146
01:56:27,814 --> 01:56:29,315
All right, here's the deal.

2147
01:56:30,526 --> 01:56:34,029
All those guys were chasing you
because you're incredible.

2148
01:56:34,112 --> 01:56:37,198
But none of them
really know who you are.

2149
01:56:38,617 --> 01:56:39,993
Who am I, Sandy?

2150
01:56:40,076 --> 01:56:42,120
You're Courtney Clarke.

2151
01:56:43,204 --> 01:56:45,666
The beautiful swan from Magic Mountain.

2152
01:56:46,667 --> 01:56:48,794
Now, I wouldn't tell you to break a deal

2153
01:56:48,877 --> 01:56:52,297
unless I thought there was
a better offer out there for you.

2154
01:56:52,964 --> 01:56:55,592
- Is there a better offer?
- Oh, absolutely.

2155
01:56:55,676 --> 01:56:58,094
There's an aggressive offer out there.

2156
01:56:58,178 --> 01:57:04,225
There's a guy who's willing to be devoted
to you 100% for your entire life.

2157
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:08,396
A guy who will make all the tough
phone calls, fight all the big fights.

2158
01:57:08,479 --> 01:57:10,941
A guy who will never doubt you.

2159
01:57:11,024 --> 01:57:12,901
Even when you doubt yourself.

2160
01:57:13,777 --> 01:57:14,778
Keep going.

2161
01:57:14,861 --> 01:57:19,783
He has surprisingly muscular quads
due to the ThighMaster.

2162
01:57:21,451 --> 01:57:23,411
But what does this guy want in return?

2163
01:57:23,494 --> 01:57:26,414
All he wants in return
is for you to be you,

2164
01:57:26,497 --> 01:57:30,418
just the way you are,
because he loves you.

2165
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:32,754
I love you.

2166
01:57:34,923 --> 01:57:36,758
I've always loved you.

2167
01:57:38,802 --> 01:57:40,596
You're my star, Courtney.

2168
01:57:42,055 --> 01:57:44,140
I love you, too, Sandy.

2169
01:57:45,726 --> 01:57:48,269
I should have told you the truth
so long ago.

2170
01:57:48,353 --> 01:57:51,272
Listen, I dye my hair.

2171
01:57:51,982 --> 01:57:54,943
And I also apologize to my clothes
if I don't wear 'em enough.

2172
01:57:55,026 --> 01:57:56,903
- No more truth.
- Absolutely.

2173
01:57:56,987 --> 01:57:58,446
Just kiss me.

2174
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:02,743
Save that kiss. I came
all the way down here for a wedding.

2175
01:58:02,826 --> 01:58:05,411
- Let's get to it.
- Yeah, let's not get him mad.

2176
01:58:05,495 --> 01:58:06,830
Yeah, you're right.

2177
01:58:07,998 --> 01:58:11,877
Boom Boom is ordained
as an interdenominational minister.

2178
01:58:11,960 --> 01:58:13,795
Or we also have...

2179
01:58:14,545 --> 01:58:16,506
Hey. Shalom.

2180
01:58:17,215 --> 01:58:18,466
There he is.

2181
01:58:18,549 --> 01:58:20,218
What do you say, kid?

2182
01:58:21,177 --> 01:58:22,553
Will you marry me?

2183
01:58:22,638 --> 01:58:24,472
You had me at "shalom."

2184
01:58:26,642 --> 01:58:31,271
♪ I prefer you to remain a Christian ♪

2185
01:58:31,354 --> 01:58:34,482
No, no, no. That's fine.
Either way, I'm good.

2186
01:58:40,906 --> 01:58:44,618
Meanwhile, Eric Lamonsoff
was across town waiting at the altar.

2187
01:58:44,701 --> 01:58:45,786
And don't feel sorry for him.

2188
01:58:45,869 --> 01:58:47,788
That whole coffee thing
worked out just great.

2189
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:51,041
Plus, he ended up marrying
Downtown Julie Brown.

2190
01:58:51,124 --> 01:58:52,125
- Honey?
- What?

2191
01:58:52,208 --> 01:58:54,294
- You got a little schmutz, right there.
- Thank you. Thank you.

2192
01:58:54,377 --> 01:58:55,921
Something had clicked with Sandy.

2193
01:58:56,004 --> 01:58:59,800
And he started reaching out
one by one to his old clients.

2194
01:58:59,883 --> 01:59:01,592
And because he started
telling them the truth...

2195
01:59:02,260 --> 01:59:04,304
most of them ended up
having pretty big careers.

2196
01:59:04,387 --> 01:59:06,056
- I signed with him.
- I signed with him.

2197
01:59:06,139 --> 01:59:08,516
- I signed with him.
- We signed with him.

2198
01:59:08,599 --> 01:59:11,311
And of course, I went back to Sandy.

2199
01:59:11,394 --> 01:59:13,647
He's my manager and
my best friend again.

2200
01:59:13,730 --> 01:59:17,400
Too bad a wedding officiated
by a puppet was not legal.

2201
01:59:17,483 --> 01:59:21,321
Which is why, 20 years later,
they're finally making it real.

2202
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:24,700
- There he is!
- Yeah! How y'all doing?

2203
01:59:30,706 --> 01:59:33,667
Show business wealth is good,
but it's not real wealth.

2204
01:59:33,750 --> 01:59:35,669
- It's not...
- Hey, shot, man?

2205
01:59:35,752 --> 01:59:37,628
- Let's do a shot? Oh, all right.
- I'm good. I'm good.

2206
01:59:37,713 --> 01:59:41,132
- Hey!
- Oh, my God! Hi!

2207
01:59:42,467 --> 01:59:43,468
I'm sorry, what?

2208
01:59:44,928 --> 01:59:47,638
I'm sorry, man.
I can't understand a word you're saying.

2209
01:59:47,723 --> 01:59:49,349
No, seriously, I got nothing.

2210
01:59:55,063 --> 01:59:58,649
All right. Hello. Hello. Hello.
Hi, guys.

2211
01:59:58,734 --> 02:00:00,068
Oh, thank you, Sandy.

2212
02:00:00,151 --> 02:00:02,612
All these years in the business,
he's got me working a wedding.

2213
02:00:02,696 --> 02:00:06,157
This is fantastic. He booked me
in a tent, really is what it is.

2214
02:00:06,950 --> 02:00:09,786
Said if I do good here,
I get a yurt next year.

2215
02:00:12,455 --> 02:00:15,541
No, um... that was, uh,
some ceremony, too.

2216
02:00:15,625 --> 02:00:18,003
It was a... It was a little awkward,
the priest and the rabbi together.

2217
02:00:18,086 --> 02:00:19,129
That's always a...

2218
02:00:19,212 --> 02:00:21,840
The rabbi, he was, like, Googling,
"Who's Jesus Christ?"

2219
02:00:21,923 --> 02:00:23,008
But that's okay.

2220
02:00:24,885 --> 02:00:26,511
Uh, what else is going on?

2221
02:00:26,594 --> 02:00:29,765
- Just bring out the couple already.
- Yeah, quit doing your act.

2222
02:00:29,848 --> 02:00:31,432
You're right.
Okay.

2223
02:00:31,516 --> 02:00:37,563
Please welcome, for the first time ever,
Mr. and Mrs. Sandy and Courtney Wexler.

Yeah, every time I ran into Sandy, he used
to say, "I got to meet this Beavis kid.

2264
02:03:47,128 --> 02:03:48,964
Yeah, I want to represent him."

2265
02:03:49,047 --> 02:03:51,632
He didn't understand
that that's a cartoon character.

2266
02:03:51,716 --> 02:03:54,510
You can't really manage
a cartoon character.

2267
02:03:54,594 --> 02:03:57,138
And, uh, he did give me
his number though,

2268
02:03:57,222 --> 02:04:00,183
and, uh, we used to call him
in the middle of the night.

2269
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:05,605
Wexler Artists.

2270
02:04:05,688 --> 02:04:08,191
Is this Sandy?

2271
02:04:08,274 --> 02:04:10,860
Yeah. Yeah, who... who is this?

2272
02:04:10,944 --> 02:04:12,695
You know who this is.

2273
02:04:12,778 --> 02:04:15,365
No, I don't. That's why I'm asking.

2274
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:17,742
Guess.

2275
02:04:17,825 --> 02:04:19,785
Are you Gary Busey?

2276
02:04:19,869 --> 02:04:22,497
No way! Dumbass.

2277
02:04:22,580 --> 02:04:24,665
Who? Beavis?

2278
02:04:25,416 --> 02:04:28,794
- You suck!
- What? No, I don't.

2279
02:04:28,878 --> 02:04:30,046
You suck balls.

2280
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:31,839
No, no, no, no.

2281
02:04:31,922 --> 02:04:33,466
You don't sound so good.

2282
02:04:33,549 --> 02:04:36,594
Now, tell me where you are
and I'll pick you up.

2283
02:04:36,677 --> 02:04:38,263
I'm in your butt.

2284
02:04:38,346 --> 02:04:40,556
What? What's this?

2285
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:43,601
Yeah, I'm in there right now.

2286
02:04:43,684 --> 02:04:44,852
Hemorrhoids.

2287
02:04:44,935 --> 02:04:48,814
Wait. You get out of my butt.
Get out right now.

2288
02:04:48,898 --> 02:04:50,316
Kill yourself.

2289
02:04:50,400 --> 02:04:54,029
Okay. Okay, that's it.
I'm hanging up the phone.

2290
02:04:57,073 --> 02:04:58,908
Wexler Artists.

2291
02:04:58,992 --> 02:05:00,994
Uh... Sandy Wexler?

2292
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:03,204
Who is this?

2293
02:05:03,288 --> 02:05:05,873
Uh, this is Butt-Head.

2294
02:05:05,956 --> 02:05:08,668
Oh, hi, Butt-Head.

2295
02:05:08,751 --> 02:05:12,297
Uh, Sandy, I'm calling about Beavis.

2296
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:16,634
Uh, yeah. Beavis wasn't
too courteous last night, Butt-Head.

2297
02:05:16,717 --> 02:05:18,928
Uh, that's why I'm calling.

2298
02:05:19,012 --> 02:05:20,013
Uh-huh.

2299
02:05:20,096 --> 02:05:22,390
Uh, Beavis wanted to say he's sorry.

2300
02:05:22,473 --> 02:05:25,810
Oh, okay. He is, huh?
He... he's sorry?

2301
02:05:25,893 --> 02:05:29,022
Yeah. Beavis says
he's sorry you're such a dumb-ass.

2302
02:05:29,105 --> 02:05:32,067
What? What's that?
What? What'd you say?

2303
02:05:32,150 --> 02:05:34,152
Uh, and he's also sorry

2304
02:05:34,235 --> 02:05:38,781
that he said your face looks like
a toilet and your balls smell funny.

2305
02:05:39,449 --> 02:05:42,660
Okay, okay.
Well, you tell him I accept.

2306
02:05:42,743 --> 02:05:45,913
Look, you're good kids,
and I like what you're doing.

2307
02:05:45,996 --> 02:05:49,625
I think if you want to get
to the next level, you're gonna...

2308
02:05:49,709 --> 02:05:52,128
- Uh, hang on a second.
- Okay.

2309
02:05:52,212 --> 02:05:53,921
Beavis wants to say something, sir.

2310
02:05:54,004 --> 02:05:56,757
- Oh, okay.
- Hey, this is Beavis.

2311
02:05:56,841 --> 02:05:58,801
Uh... oh, hi, Beavis.

2312
02:06:00,010 --> 02:06:02,012
- Sandy Wexler?
- Yeah.

2313
02:06:02,097 --> 02:06:04,557
Sandy Wexler?

2314
02:06:04,640 --> 02:06:08,561
- Yeah, I know my name.
- Of Wexler Fartists?

2315
02:06:08,644 --> 02:06:11,522
All right. Okay, come on, guys.

2316
02:06:11,606 --> 02:06:15,485
Uh...
You said you wanna come on guys?

2317
02:06:17,153 --> 02:06:18,654
That's it. I'm getting off.

2318
02:06:18,738 --> 02:06:22,200
You said you're getting off.

2319
02:06:22,283 --> 02:06:25,035
All right.
Listen, you sons of bitches.

2320
02:06:25,120 --> 02:06:26,412
I'll find your parents

2321
02:06:26,496 --> 02:06:30,166
and make you wish you never messed
with the king of Hollywood.

2322
02:06:30,250 --> 02:06:32,001
You said "wood."

2323
02:06:32,085 --> 02:06:34,379
All right.
Come on!

2324
02:06:35,505 --> 02:06:36,672
Stop it!

2325
02:06:38,383 --> 02:06:39,550
- All right, good.
- All right.

2326
02:06:39,634 --> 02:06:41,636
...Yeah!
