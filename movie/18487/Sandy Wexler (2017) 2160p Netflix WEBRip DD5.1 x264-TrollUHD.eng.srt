00:00:16,517 --> 00:00:18,018
[man 1] <i>They said he was</i>
<i>out the door in two weeks.</i>

2
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:19,853
<i>Then I hear the guy's re-upped</i>
<i>for five years.</i>

3
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:20,938
[man 2] <i>The label hated it.</i>

00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:23,315
[Kevin Nealon] <i>This castle belongs</i>
<i>to the Duke of Gloucester.</i>

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:26,735
<i>So I realize that was the guy who kept</i>
<i>angrily staring at me the whole time.</i>

6
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:28,571
-[laughs]
-[man] Hey, Kevin. Hey, Lorne.

7
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,280
-You ready for this?
-Yeah, what's that?

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:31,865
Oh, oh! We're gonna do the thing. Okay.

9
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:33,158
All right, you want to start it off?

10
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:35,703
-Talk to you, or talk to the lens?
-[man] Either way.

11
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,914
So, Sandy Wexler...

12
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:43,752
[smacks lips] Where do I begin?

13
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:46,088
He may be the most unique guy I ever met.

14
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:49,717
If you were working in Los Angeles
in the '90s, any time in there,

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,259
you'd run into Sandy Wexler at some point.

16
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:53,637
Sandy was one of those
fringe Hollywood managers

17
00:00:53,721 --> 00:00:55,430
that you always sort of saw around.

18
00:00:55,513 --> 00:01:00,102
You know, you'd see him at a wrap party,
and he'd be laughing, stuffing his face.

19
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,730
You'd think,
"No one even invited this guy."

20
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,733
Sandy said I could be
the next Patrick Swayze. [scoffs]

21
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:08,151
Only thing he ever said to me
that made sense.

22
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:12,155
Sandy was not a big shot.
He was a... He was a tiny shot.

23
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:16,534
But anybody who met him,
you never forgot him.

24
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:19,747
You know, you gotta remember
there was no YouTube, there was no Vines.

25
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:21,707
And none of that...
None of the social media platforms.

26
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,834
You really needed a guy like Sandy
to be seen.

27
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:28,130
Not Sandy.
Not Sandy, but a guy like Sandy.

28
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,632
[rock music playing]

29
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:44,479
[blowing]

30
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:02,247
Hey, Arsenio!
Nice to see you again, kiddo.

31
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,749
Have I seen you before?

32
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,334
[laughs] Yeah, it's Sandy Wexler.

33
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:10,213
I met you at Bernie's beach house,
with Doug and Danny.

34
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,174
You guys were playing hangman.

35
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:16,219
You were hysterical that night.
No one could figure out the word "canoe."

36
00:02:17,179 --> 00:02:19,056
I have no idea
what you're talking about, man.

37
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,725
How you doing with your manager, kid?
Are you still fighting?

38
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,727
I don't have a manager, man.

39
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,354
Well, you do now. If you want one.

40
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:28,106
No, I'm good. I... I have an agent.

41
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,025
-Oh.
-As a matter of fact, I have six agents.

42
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,234
Got plenty of white people in my life.

43
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:32,319
-All right.
-I'm good, dawg.

44
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,448
An agent is business. A manager is family.

45
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,703
He guides you. He advises you.
He fights the good fights.

46
00:02:40,786 --> 00:02:42,329
Makes the tough phone calls.

47
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:45,666
Truth is, I'm not happy unless...
unless you're happy.

48
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:49,169
So what do you say, Arsenio?
You wanna get happy together?

49
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,132
Continued success, Arsenio!

50
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,761
-[whooping] Okay? Oh!
-[pager beeping]

51
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,513
I got a hit on the hip, and it's Sinbad.

52
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,474
I don't think any of those people
were really beeping him.

53
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:05,018
'Cause he would just go, like,
"Oh, jeez, Mackenzie Phillips."

54
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:06,394
The one thing about Sandy is,

55
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:09,189
-he just never stopped lying.
-Always.

56
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,984
Managers get used to lying,
but Sandy took it to an art form.

57
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:16,822
Where am I? I'm in Joel Silver's office
right now, talking about you.

58
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,198
If you land on your feet--

59
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,616
Hey, buddy, how long are you gonna be?

60
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,870
Excuse me, I am talking
to Lew Wasserman's neighbor right now.

61
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,832
That was Janet Maslin from the <i>Times.</i>

62
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,125
Sandy's personal life?

63
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,878
-I know nothing. I know nothing.
-Did he have a personal life?

64
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:32,880
-He wasn't married.
-Didn't date.

65
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,840
It was sad. Seemed like he
didn't have any friends, right?

66
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:35,841
He had no friends.

67
00:03:41,096 --> 00:03:42,139
Any good?

68
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,893
[children laughing on film]

69
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,729
[Sandy] No, no, no, no, no, no.

70
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,023
[laughing]

71
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:53,650
That's great.

72
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:59,197
[stammering] But he was
the king of the fake laugh

73
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,909
-and the applauding combo. Yeah.
-Combo. Yeah.

74
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:03,451
[laughing]

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,247
Next time he'll get his own ketchup.

76
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,791
[laughs]

77
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:10,793
You gotta go.

78
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:13,003
Is Mary Jo Slater
the casting agent on this?

79
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,379
-No. I don't know.
-Good job, guys.

80
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,715
I was in Nam.
But, you know, I was there in 1984,

81
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,427
so it was... It was a different vibe.

82
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,970
[laughs]

83
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,598
And then all I hear in the back is...

84
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,936
[mimics Sandy laughing]

85
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,688
-He would fake laugh at funny comics.
-That melon.

86
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,816
It was like, "Why are you fake laughing?

87
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,567
-It's Eddie Murphy. He's funny."
-[Dana Carvey] Right!

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,153
When it came to eating
with Sandy, he, um...

89
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,322
It was like a smorgasbord on his face.

90
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,491
I mean, he was on the Atkins diet, right?
So he always had, like, chicken...

91
00:04:43,575 --> 00:04:45,202
-Kielbasa.
-T-bone steak.

92
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,619
-Brisket.
-Beef jerky.

93
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:49,622
I never actually ate with Sandy,
but I did hear it was kind of gross.

94
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,458
[chewing loudly]

95
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,335
Can you close your mouth
just a little bit?

96
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:56,922
What did I do?

97
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:59,842
He dressed like your grandfather,

98
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:04,888
he had the table manners of a horse,
but he was a great manager.

99
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,057
He really cared about his clients.

100
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,893
He made them his family.
He was with them all the time.

101
00:05:09,977 --> 00:05:13,105
And, uh, I wasn't sure
what he was doing for them,

102
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,189
but you could feel the love.

103
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:18,986
I spoke to Chili's. I think I can
get us the corner table there

104
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:20,570
and preorder the appetizers.

105
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,239
I don't give a shit
about Chili's right now.

106
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,824
I thought you wanted to go to Chili's.

107
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,492
-No, I never said that.
-You said that.

108
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,869
That's okay.

109
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:29,329
You're nervous.
I can see that you're sweating.

110
00:05:29,412 --> 00:05:30,705
-I'm scared, Sandy.
-Yeah.

111
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,916
I gotta jump over ten trailers
and land on a waterbed.

112
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,751
[laughs]

113
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,086
Why are you laughing?

114
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,130
Because you're funny.
You make me laugh.

115
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,507
-Well, I'm not trying to be funny.
-No, it's the way you said it.

116
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,425
The way I said...
What are you... [sighs]

117
00:05:42,509 --> 00:05:44,094
Look at the size of this crowd.

118
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,181
You said they'd come, and they came.

119
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:53,436
Ladies and gentlemen
of El Segundo Motor Home Court,

120
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,397
here to defy gravity,

121
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:01,653
please let's welcome Wild Gary Roberts!

122
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:03,738
-Rodgers!
-Rodgers!

123
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
He said that. He said Rodgers.

124
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,701
Yeah, 'cause I told him to!

125
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,162
He said it the first time.

126
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,541
I... I wish we could...
'Cause he did say it the first time.

127
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,335
-Stop talking.
-All right. I will.

128
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,963
You get up there
and you show these people who you are.

129
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:22,049
Gary Rodgers.

130
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:24,051
It's Gary Rodgers. You said that, right?

131
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:25,177
The second time.

132
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,761
Yeah, but you knew it.

133
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:28,513
Okay, guys, let's do this.

134
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,314
[shouting indistinctly]

135
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,026
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're...

136
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,361
[continues shouting indistinctly]

137
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:46,489
What are you pointing to?
I can only go forward.

138
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,201
[shouting indistinctly]

139
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:52,412
Oh, my God.

140
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,498
He's really gonna jump
over all those trailers?

141
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:58,835
Sir, my client is the best daredevil
trapeze artist in the world.

142
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,003
Thank you very much.

143
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,672
[breathes heavily] Let's go.

144
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,549
Yeah!

145
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,969
-What?
-[screeching]

146
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,845
[screaming and grunting]

147
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,638
[lands heavily]

148
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,182
-[Gary groans]
-Oh, shit!

149
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,809
-Jesus Christ!
-[laughing]

150
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:16,979
[straining] Sandy.

151
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:20,523
-He had this one guy, Ted Rafferty...
-Oh, yeah.

152
00:07:20,607 --> 00:07:23,526
...who was a, you know, puppet act.
Not that good. Like, a middle act.

153
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,612
He believed in him.
He thought he was the greatest.

154
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,323
He's like, "I'm gonna make him
the next Mr. Buttons."

155
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,950

00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:40,171
Barbra Streisand started
as a backup singer in a petting zoo.

309
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,383
Liza Minnelli used to sing in a coal mine.

310
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,510
Wasn't her mother Judy Garland?

311
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,178
No, that's made up.

312
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:51,808
[stammers] The mightiest tornado
starts with a small breeze.

313
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,643
You sound like a fortune cookie.

314
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,062
I used to represent a guy
who wrote fortune cookies.

315
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,730
[scoffs] Get out of here.

316
00:14:57,814 --> 00:15:00,274
Yeah, he wrote for <i>Happy Days</i>
and fortune cookies.

317
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,234
Let me ask you something.

318
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,697
Why do you do what you do?

319
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,408
I don't know.

320
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,411
The only time I really feel alive
is when I'm singing.

321
00:15:11,494 --> 00:15:15,832
Well, imagine if you were singing
on stage in front of 50,000 people.

322
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,667
You think you'd feel alive then?

323
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:21,754
Up there singing like a bird
and an angel had a baby?

324
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,298
You like the bird and angel thing,
don't you?

325
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,925
I said that already?

326
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,052
-Can I ask you something?
-Please do.

327
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,012
Can you get any of that food
in your mouth?

328
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:37,562
So you're saying I should quit right now
and leave with you?

329
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,690
You're too big for this duck pond.
It's time to fly.

330
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,066
[chuckles]

331
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,068
You like to make trouble,
don't you, Sandy?

332
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,113
What do you say? Wanna team up?

333
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:51,408
I'll tell you what I told Josh Gelfand
in the sixth grade

334
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,786
-when he asked me to the spring social.
-Uh-huh.

335
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:56,122
I'd love to,
but we gotta ask my dad first.

336
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:58,415
[girls] Ooh!

337
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,168
[laughs]

338
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:04,547
[Courtney] I guess I should have mentioned
my Dad's in Seward, Alaska.

339
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,382
[Sandy] Oh, that's fine. I love it there.

340
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:07,300
It's beautiful.

341
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,594
-Oh, you've been?
-No, I haven't been there.

342
00:16:10,553 --> 00:16:11,971
-But you just said--
-No, I didn't.

343
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,517
[Courtney] I guess I should have also
mentioned the prison thing.

344
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,601
[Sandy] Are you kidding?

345
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:19,979
-I was in prison my entire childhood.
-[sighs]

346
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,275
An emotional prison.
That's a life sentence, I'm telling you.

347
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:29,280
-The Yugo, imported from France.
-[Courtney] Isn't it from Yugoslavia?

348
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:35,620
[Sandy] No. "You go" to France.
"You go" and have a good time. <i>Bonjour.</i>

349
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,039
-[door alarm buzzing]
-[indistinct announcement over PA]

350
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:40,750
Hey, Poppy.

351
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,209
How you doing?

352
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:44,587
Oh, it's always a great day
when I see my little girl.

353
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:49,216
Mr. Clarke, truly a pleasure.
Sandy Wexler of Wexler Artists.

354
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,052
Is this the fool that want to manage you?

355
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:54,972
Um, yes, I did come up here
to talk to you about that.

356
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:59,143
[stammering] And if you're available
to speak, you know, and now's the time,

357
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,688
I would love to have
a conversation about this.

358
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,690
If we could conversate, I'm here to--

359
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:05,858
What about Six Flags Magic Mountain?

360
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,737
I mean, she got benefits,
a paycheck every week.

361
00:17:09,821 --> 00:17:11,238
That mountain is truly magical.

362
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,364
No, it is.

363
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:16,368
I just, with all due respect,
I think your daughter has the magic.

364
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:20,707
With her talent,
she could have a dream-come-true life.

365
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,208
You mean, better than all of this?

366
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:23,834
-[laughs]
-[scoffs]

367
00:17:23,918 --> 00:17:24,752
What?

368
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,714
Dad.

369
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:29,591
Who else have you managed?

370
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:32,218
You ever hear of Indiana Jones?

371
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:33,803
You work with Harrison Ford?

372
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,222
No, but I do represent the guy

373
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,266
who got his heart pulled out of his chest
in <i>Temple of Doom.</i>

374
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,434
I love that guy.

375
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,019
Everybody does.

376
00:17:42,103 --> 00:17:44,772
I don't know anything
about show business, Sandy.

377
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,107
How do I know if I can trust you?

378
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:50,862
Because I can look you dead in the eye
and promise you this:

379
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,532
I will always do what's best
for your daughter.

380
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,373
Well, okay. In that case...

Okay. Good. Will do...
Will never do it again.

386
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,429
You guys want to go out and celebrate?

00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,806
I can't go nowhere.

Oh, that's right. I'm sorry.
Please don't shiv me.

00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,026
Got ya.

Oh! Ha!

00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,237
Very good.

394
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,491
Darling, you should take Sandy out
for a dinner and a show, Alaskan style.

395
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:42,622
-[Sandy] That's amazing.
-[Courtney] Right?

396
00:18:42,705 --> 00:18:43,915
So good.

397
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:48,210
The northern lights
and my new friend Sandy.

398
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:49,712
That's as good as it gets.

399
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,589
Northern lights are something else.

400
00:18:52,674 --> 00:18:54,425
I was actually talking
about the burger, though.

401
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,886
-Is this bison, or is it moose meat?
-[laughing]

402
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,721
[stammers] What's making it so good?

403
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,890
It's a hamburger, crazy man.

404
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,059
-A hamburger?
-And you're missing out without the bun.

405
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,518
Now, the bun...

406
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,729
If I lose five more pounds,
it's back to the buns.

407
00:19:06,813 --> 00:19:07,814
Oh, my God.

408
00:19:07,897 --> 00:19:09,106
[sighs]

409
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:12,318
So you really think I could be somebody?

410
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,571
-You are going straight to the top.
-Yeah?

411
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:17,907
Up there
with all the other beautiful stars.

412
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:19,992
Show me which star I am.

413
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,286
-You wanna know which star you are?
-Yeah.

414
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,454
Let's see.

415
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:26,165
You are that one right there.

416
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,000
[Courtney] Sandy, that's an airplane.

417
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,462
I know. I told you, you were going places.

418
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,548
-That's real smooth, Sandy.
-Thank you.

419
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:36,550
You must be a real lady-killer.

420
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:38,010
Listen,

421
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,347
if we're gonna do business together,
we gotta have boundaries.

422
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,808
I'm sorry,
but I learned that the hard way.

423
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,392
A bad breakup?

424
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,020
His name was Alfred.

425
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:50,064
Oh, you're gay!

426
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,399
I can see that now.

427
00:19:52,483 --> 00:19:54,694
No, I'm not gay as far as I know.

428
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:59,115
-Alfred was my first client.
-Mmm-hmm.

429
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,701
More than that.
He was... He was my best friend.

430
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:02,994
Did he die?

431
00:20:03,077 --> 00:20:04,286
No, no.

432
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:09,500
He got famous, and he, uh...
and he dumped me.

433
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,335
That dick!

434
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:14,964
He wasn't a dick.
I was the dick. It was my fault.

435
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,217
I let the friendship
get in the way of the business.

436
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,221
Now understand it's show business,
not show friendship. Right?

437
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,931
That is so sad.

438
00:20:24,015 --> 00:20:26,475
It's not sad. It's actually a good thing.

439
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:30,479
Because I got a stable of talent
in Hollywood

440
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:34,150
that I, quite frankly,
think is the best of the bunch.

441
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:37,528
And Eisner knows it, and Ovitch knows it.

442
00:20:38,529 --> 00:20:41,032
I'm sorry,
and I don't wanna toot my own horn

443
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:43,993
'cause that's not what I like to do,
but toot-toot.

444
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,828
Hmm.

445
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,622
Best thing to me is I found you.

446
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,542
I'm glad you found me.

447
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,128
You're not as happy as I am.
Trust me.

448
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:56,672
But we gotta get to work.

449
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,549
Whenever Sandy signed a new client,

450
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:02,762
he had a team of support people that
immediately began making over the client.

451
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,265
He would just enroll everybody
in classes for the stuff they didn't do.

452
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,267
Movement, martial arts...

453
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:11,062
A posture person, and then a hair person.

454
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,439
-And no one was better off after that.
-No.

455
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:14,523
It was a train wreck.

456
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:15,775
I'm not a dancer, Sandy.

457
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,069
-It doesn't matter if you can't dance.
-It's all right.

458
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:21,113
-Miss Gideon is gonna teach you to move.
-I got you, sweetheart.

459
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,532
-It's about presence on stage.
-All right. That's enough, Sandy.

460
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,367
-All right. Here we go.
-It's about being comfortable.

461
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,162
-You know, Baryshnikov, I hear--

616
00:28:12,733 --> 00:28:16,612
-You see, that is why I love this guy.
-What?

617
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,115
[stammers] He actually talked to me
when I was just an assistant.

618
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,200
You treated me with respect, Sandy.

619
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:23,827
-Not many people did.
-Well, of course.

620
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,829
-This is my girl, Mary.
-Hi.

621
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,122
Mary. Sandy Wexler.

622
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,374
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

623
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:29,833
Are you...
What happened to your arm?

624
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:34,588
-Yeah, I got myself a tattoo.
-What'd you get?

625
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,716
Uh... it is that of a dog bite.

626
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,094
So how's Carr D'Angelo?

627
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,139
Well, he, uh... he left.
He's working for Blockbuster Video now.

628
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:48,352
Smart move.
The music business has its ups and downs,

629
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,438
but Blockbuster Video's here
for the long haul.

630
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,190
And you, what are you up to?

631
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,484
I left, too.

632
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:57,778
-I'm at Capitol Records now.
-Oh.

633
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:59,238
He's head of A&R.

634
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:02,574
You know how happy that makes me?

635
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,035
Hiccups Bubatzi goes big time.

636
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,579
That's just...
That's the way it should be.

637
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,831
You worked your ass off, kiddo.

638
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,501
Can I talk business for a second?
Is that all right?

639
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,628
I have a client that, actually,
you would love to meet--

640
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:15,962
-Tell you what...
-What?

641
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:19,550
Call my office next week. Yeah.

642
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,843
I mean, you sure? 'Cause I will call.

643

-[laughs] I know.
-[laughs]

644
00:29:24,054 --> 00:29:25,764

-It was great seeing you.

645
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,267
And I hope, uh,
one of those dresses works out for you.

646
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,436

-[Mary] Cute.

647
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:32,604
-[laughing] It was... I mean...
-So good.

648
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,774
It's a Bubatzi world. We're all just--

649
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,818
Could you please
not block the whole aisle?

650
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,195
We're all just living in it.

651
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,655
I wasn't blocking the aisle.

652
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:48,454
[Sandy] Wow.

653
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:53,041
-Hi.
-Hey, neighbor.

654
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,960
Hi, Cindy!

655
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:57,212
Where's that
billionaire landlord of yours?

656
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:59,506
Is he ever going to grace us
with his presence?

657
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,425
[laughs] What a question.

658
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:04,177
Listen, he's supposed to come out
for Rosh Hashanah,

659
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,179
but he said last year Purim,
so who knows?

660
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,223
-[laughs]
-But anyways, how are you?

661
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,600
How is your husband?

662
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,728
Doctors say it could be any day now. Hmm.

663
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,564
Oh, I'm so sorry. It's just...

664
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,609
How are you doing?
No one ever asks how you're doing.

665
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:19,693
How you feeling?

666
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,195
The truth is that I'm just...

667
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,155
a little bit lonely.

668
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:27,493
You were together so long.
Of course you're lonely.

669
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:30,161
So if you ever see
my tennis court lights on at night...

670
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,374
that means that I could use some company.

671
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:40,464
-It was great to see you, Cindy.
-Bye, Sandy.

672
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,134
Okay, we're gonna go.
All right. Good night, now.

673
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,552
Good night.

Look, Gary Rodgers can't make that jump

675
00:30:48,472 --> 00:30:51,892
unless you clear
every bird from the sky, Tom.

676
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,399
I don't know. Is there a spray for it?
Like, a... a roach spray or...

677
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:00,275
There's dogs. There's dogs.

678
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:02,277
A roach spray for birds.

679
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:06,865
Tom, I'm sorry.
That's not my job. That's your job.

680
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,909
That's why I'm telling you.

681
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,327
I'm telling ya!

682
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:14,205
Listen, don't do that to me!
I'll pull the plug on this thing!

683

Do you hear me?

All right. I'm sorry I got hot there,
Tom, but you weren't listening.

Okay, here's a stock tip
for you to make up for that.

Pull all your money out of Apple,

'cause no one's using
the Macintosh anymore.

the other 20% into Woolworth's.

it's the only way they can hear.

692
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,111
You look stunning.

693
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:50,451
Well, this yard is the most amazing yard
I've ever seen, and that pool--

694
00:31:50,534 --> 00:31:52,327
The pool's off-limits. House rules.

that expresses the right message.

I'm complicated. I'm sexy."

00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:22,816
Okay, I'll be back in a few seconds.

705
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,568
Okay, cool, we'll be in the pool.

-You stay out of the pool.
-[chuckles]

707

I was just kidding.

I know, and it was hysterical.

709

and the best, brightest person ever.

I'm gonna go with the one
on the top right corner.

And can you blow up... that one?

Oh, my God.

What? It's a good picture.

722
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,613

No, I do. I'm just grateful
you all actually just listened to it.

00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,667
That's what we do. It's our ritual.

Whenever anybody at Wexler Artists
completes a project,

-we gather together.
-We do?

you had other clients until today.

Oh, you guys all knew about each other.

in a different league from them.

Okay, and who is that guy?

932

Can we put him in a drawer or something?
That's horrifying.

Sandy, aren't you forgetting
the best part of the ritual?

934

-What's that, dear?
-Jumping in the pool.

We are not permitted in the pool! Okay?

-Firuz forbids it.
-You're not in a cult, are you, Sandy?

No, Firuz is my landlord.

He does not allow us in the pool.
It is forbidden.

There was an earthquake in Los Angeles.

-Congratulations, Courtney.
-Oh, well, we got a great manager.

1174
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:38,585
He told me to always sing from the heart.

1175
00:55:38,668 --> 00:55:41,171
And I tell this girl,
"Always act from the heart."

1176

the Mentos commercial I was on hold for?

1177
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:47,719
No, you weren't on hold for it.
What I said was,

1178

"I called them and they put me on hold
for about 45 minutes."

1179

But when they... they got on the phone,
they told me they passed on you.

-Well, there you go.
-No, it's good.

1181

she loved the Mentos.

All right. Let's get that done.

1195

-You think he's around?
-Yeah, it'll be good to see him again.

Uh, yeah, let's find him.

Mmm! This is so good, Mr. Jones.

Nothing. No, I think it's good.

Okay. I'm gonna try
to respect your opinion, brother.

-Yeah, okay.
-That's too much. No.

00:57:25,484 --> 00:57:26,901
Who the hell is Quincelius?

1216
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:30,155
Nobody. Come on. What are we doing here?

1217
00:57:33,075 --> 00:57:34,659
Thank you.

1218
00:57:34,743 --> 00:57:36,954
It was grapey. It was a little grapey.

1219
00:57:37,037 --> 00:57:40,624
-I think you offended him.
-No, I didn't.

1220
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,251
I thought it was cool.

1221
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:47,256
When he comes back,
I dare you to say you hate that one, too.

1222
00:57:47,339 --> 00:57:48,507
-What?
-[chuckles]

1223
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,843
The man spent $8,000 on the wine.
He'll kill me.

1224
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,638
Oh, we'll laugh our asses off. Come on.

1225
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:59,393
-Courtney, what do you got me doing here?
-I was saving this for a special occasion.

1226
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:01,270
I think this is special enough.

1227
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:03,355
[all laughing]

1228
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,732
You'll have to let me know
what you think, baby.

1229
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,567
Yeah. Thank you.

1230
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:09,944
Very much.

1231
00:58:11,405 --> 00:58:13,032
What do you think, honey?

1232
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:16,326
Mr. Jones, this is exquisite.

1233
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,037
And, Sanford, you likey?

1234
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,919
-Honestly?
-What else, man?

1235
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,090
-It's a little nutty.
-Nutty?

1236
00:58:31,341 --> 00:58:32,842
For my taste.

1237
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,017
Maybe if you put an ice cube in it...

1238
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:44,813
-[woman gasps] Oh, my goodness.
-Get out of my house!

1239
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,273
-Now!
-Hey, hey, I didn't mean to--

1240
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,317
-[guests gasp]
-[coughs]

1241
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,402
-Now! Out! Out!
-[stammers] I'm gonna leave.

1242
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:53,072
-No, I just got to get my jacket.
-Out! Get... get out of here.

1243
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,781
-[stammers] Listen.
-Out!

1244
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:58,202
Man, one of these is mine.
Is this navy or black?

1245
00:58:58,285 --> 00:59:02,122
I'm having a hard time seeing.
My glasses are blurry from the wine toss.

1246
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,373
[Jones] Get out!

1247
00:59:03,457 --> 00:59:06,043
You know what? This is probably it.
I... I'm gonna go.

1248
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,837
-Leave!
-Courtney! Okay.

1249
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,049
Hey. Thank you, Q-bert.
It was a great night.

1250
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:15,135
-[laughs] Did you see the way that was--
-You made me do that! You!

1251
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:16,511
-How are we getting out?
-Are you happy?

1252
00:59:16,595 --> 00:59:18,930
I don't know where...
Go. Just go. Is he coming?

1253
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:22,892
Courtney's first single was huge.
I remember the album was even bigger.

1254
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,937
I heard every song
on every station of every radio.

1255
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:28,940
["Mr. DJ" playing]

1256
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,277
Yay, Courtney!

1257
00:59:32,361 --> 00:59:33,820
[all cheering]

1258
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:37,116
Courtney blew up
to Whitney Houston-type status.

1259
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:38,200
Oh, really?

1260
00:59:38,283 --> 00:59:39,951
-So it was crazy.
-Mariah Carey, you know...

1261
00:59:44,331 --> 00:59:48,252
You're nobody, and then you're somebody,
and everyone's clamoring after you.

1262
00:59:48,335 --> 00:59:50,837
And it's scary. It can be scary.

1263
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:56,885
[pager beeping]

1264
01:00:01,765 --> 01:00:04,017
[line ringing]

1265
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:06,520
-[Courtney] <i>Sandy...</i>
-Courtney, what's wrong?

1266
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,813
I think someone's outside my house.

1267
01:00:08,897 --> 01:00:11,441
I'm scared it's one of those freaks
that's been calling me or something.

1268
01:00:11,525 --> 01:00:13,610
What? Who's calling you?

1269
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,903
I don't know.

1270
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:17,781
I've been dealing with this
ever since I moved into this place.

1271
01:00:17,864 --> 01:00:19,991
-Are your doors locked?
-Yeah.

1272
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,244
<i>You stay inside. I'll be right there.</i>

1273
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,589
You're in trouble now, tough guy!

1274
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:38,427
Look what I've been carrying
around in my backseat...

1275
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:42,139
ever since I was attacked
on Ventura Place.

1276
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,434
Huh? You like this?

1277
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:47,936
You wanna... You wanna feel it?

1278
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,148
Come out! Where are you?

1279
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:55,026
-Courtney, stay in the house!
-[twig snaps]

1280
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:56,110
[gasps]

1281
01:00:58,363 --> 01:00:59,531
What's that?

1282
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,285
What? You think you can hide?

1283
01:01:05,954 --> 01:01:09,541
Are you scared? Huh?

1284
01:01:09,624 --> 01:01:11,960
'Cause I'm scared, too.

1285
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,380
I'm scared I'm gonna shatter
every bone in your face!

1286
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:17,131
[exclaims]

1287
01:01:22,346 --> 01:01:23,597
You're gone?

1288
01:01:25,474 --> 01:01:28,185
That's it. Truce.

1289
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,395
No more.

1290
01:01:31,355 --> 01:01:33,273
-[exclaims]
-[raccoon screeches]

1291
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:37,194
Ow!

1292
01:01:37,277 --> 01:01:38,403
[knocking on door]

1293
01:01:41,615 --> 01:01:46,745
What you were so afraid of
was nothing but a raccoon. [laughs]

1294
01:01:46,828 --> 01:01:47,829
[scoffs] No way.

1295
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:51,208
I'm telling you, you'll never have to
worry about him again, though.

1296
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,627
You didn't kill him, did you?

1297
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:56,796
No. No. Uh, I...

1298
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,134
I seen him go out into the forest again
to see his family, so...

1299
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02,886
All right? But I screamed at him.

1300
01:02:02,969 --> 01:02:06,306
I let him know, "Don't come back here.
You stay with the...

1301
01:02:07,474 --> 01:02:09,351
On your side of the fence."

1302
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,270
Okay.

1303
01:02:11,353 --> 01:02:13,272
Come on in.
Let me wash those clothes.

1304
01:02:13,355 --> 01:02:17,401
When I used to represent Hooch
from <i>Turner & Hooch,</i>

1305
01:02:17,484 --> 01:02:21,738
I got a similar call
about a late-night trespasser.

1306
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,449
Turned out it was Benji's trainer.

1307
01:02:24,533 --> 01:02:29,579
Uh, he was jealous that Hooch
was now the hottest dog in the business.

1308
01:02:29,663 --> 01:02:32,707
-You're making that up.
-No, no, no, I think that's true.

1309
01:02:32,791 --> 01:02:35,960
You're insane, Sandy.
Take off those pants.

1310
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,298
What? What, right here?

1311
01:02:39,381 --> 01:02:40,424
I won't look.

1312
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:42,592
Well, you'll be missing out, then.

1313
01:02:42,676 --> 01:02:44,344
Oh, really?

1314
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:47,221
No. Maybe you should turn around.

1315
01:02:47,306 --> 01:02:49,766
[chuckles] Turning around.

1316
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,852
I'm glad you took this place, by the way.

1317
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:54,688
The real estate lady told me

1318
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:58,567
that David Crosby died
three times in this house.

1319
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,902
I'm gonna keep the beeper,
if that's all right.

1320
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:03,738
Kevin Connors did a show on Brea tonight,

1321
01:03:03,822 --> 01:03:07,867
co-headlining with AJ Jamal.
I wanna make sure that went well.

1322
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,204
So, pants are coming down.

1323
01:03:12,121 --> 01:03:13,373
Here you go.

1324
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:15,709
[sighs]

1325
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,337
All right. Come on.
Let's get these washed.

1326
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,005
Sure. Hey, thanks for doing that.

1327
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,470
You called Bling, too?

1328
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:28,513
Oh, I was here anyway, Sandy.

1329
01:03:28,597 --> 01:03:30,474
With my pants on.

1330
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,064
The important thing
is that Courtney feels safe.

1331
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,066
-That's all I'm worried about.
-[Courtney] Hmm.

1332
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:41,818
An unlisted phone number.

1333
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,737
That's the way to go
for an artist of your stature.

1334
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:45,780
I can get that done for you
tomorrow morning.

1335
01:03:45,864 --> 01:03:49,075
Oh, no, it's all... It's all good, Sandy.
I handled it already.

1336
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:52,245
Oh, you did? Good. Good. Good for you.

1337
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,125
Sandy, can you pass me the gravy?

1338
01:03:57,208 --> 01:04:00,712
Can I pass you the gravy?
Absolutely. I can pass you the gravy.

1339
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:02,547
-Here. You want me to put it on for you?
-I got it.

1340
01:04:02,631 --> 01:04:03,923
-You got it?
-Yeah.

1341
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,760
I was thinking we should get back
in the studio, Courtney.

1342
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:09,262
Maybe noodle around with some new tunes.

1343
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,973
[chuckles] With all due respect, Sandy,
I understand that,

1344
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:15,268
but, uh, her existing record's
gonna be on the charts for months.

1345
01:04:15,352 --> 01:04:17,604
You don't want her competing
against herself now, do you?

1346
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:21,733
Who else do you want her competing with?
I mean it's a win-win. To me.

1347
01:04:24,318 --> 01:04:25,570
I know what you mean, Sandy.

1348
01:04:25,654 --> 01:04:28,865
I have lots of ideas,
but I can't tomorrow.

1349
01:04:28,948 --> 01:04:31,075
We've got publicist meetings.

1350
01:04:31,159 --> 01:04:34,371
-Publicists? What... what publicists?
-Oh, yeah, just the top ones.

1351
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:36,039
You know what?
I'll send you the list, actually.

1352
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,708
You know what?
Better yet, I'll e-mail you the list.

1353
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:41,545
-What is that?
-Oh, you're not familiar with e-mail?

1354
01:04:41,628 --> 01:04:45,382
E-mail? Of course I heard of that.
Which one are you talking about?

1355
01:04:45,465 --> 01:04:49,636
You got your computer, right?
And you plug that into your phone line...

1356
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:55,434
...and you could send a document to
another computer clear across the country

1357
01:04:55,517 --> 01:04:57,602
in a matter of minutes.

1358
01:04:57,686 --> 01:05:01,398
Who licks the envelope? R2-D2?
I'm lost right now.

1359
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:04,150
Now I think we're making
a wrong move here.

1360
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:08,321
I have a publicity campaign designed
strictly for this woman right here.

1361
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:11,533
You have a publicity campaign? Well,
I mean, we're... The family's all here.

1362
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,367
We would love to hear about it.
What is it?

1363
01:05:13,452 --> 01:05:15,870
Well, I usually like my clients
to start slow.

1364
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:17,997

I'm the reason?

-What are you, 14, Sandy?

No, I'm not 14. I'm not 14 at all.

Your job is to protect her.

I protect her 24/7!

By screwing up her shot on <i>Arsenio?</i>

What did you do, Sandy?

1388

Did you file the paperwork for the Grammy
nomination before the deadline?

1389
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:15,514
Did you squash the story in the <i>Enquirer</i>

1390
01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:18,933
about her corrections officer father
falling asleep during a prison riot?

1391

Did you send envelopes of cash
to the radio stations

1392
01:06:21,144 --> 01:06:22,436

No, you didn't do that.

You know how I know
you didn't do it, Sandy?

1395
01:06:26,566 --> 01:06:28,442
Because I did it. I did all those things.

1396
01:06:28,527 --> 01:06:31,112
And what did you do? Hmm?

1397

You made sure Gary,
the daredevil trapeze artist,

1398
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,036
was her opening act
at the Universal Amphitheatre.

1399
01:06:39,037 --> 01:06:40,038
Gary is family.

1400

does it, Sandy?

1406
01:06:52,634 --> 01:06:55,011
She got 'em back.
She's too good to lose a crowd.

She's too good for you.

Sandy, she could have

She wants me!

That's why it's difficult
for me to tell you this.

So what? You don't want
to work together anymore?

1443

Well, it's just the current situation
isn't fair to you, either.

-Hey, hey.
-And here's your throne.

1518
01:14:20,039 --> 01:14:22,083
Why don't you sit down, Sandy? [chuckles]

1519
01:14:22,166 --> 01:14:24,252
-Hey.
-What would you like to drink?

1520
01:14:24,335 --> 01:14:26,462
You know, I got a bit of a sour stomach.

1521
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:30,633
If you got Dr. Brown's black cherry diet,
that would be perfect.

1522
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,638
Or a big glass of whiskey.
Either way is...

1523
01:14:37,098 --> 01:14:39,017
[rock music playing]

1524
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:46,399
Oh, look.

1525
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:48,734
[stammers] Ah.

1526
01:14:49,193 --> 01:14:50,486
[mutters appreciatively]

1527
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:56,700
Did you ever see
that naughty little movie, <i>9½ Weeks?</i>

1528
01:14:56,784 --> 01:14:58,119
No, I didn't.

1529
01:14:58,202 --> 01:15:01,414
I saw <i>Problem Child,</i> though.
That kid was hysterical.

1530
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,586
Well, not as funny as that.
Look at you. [laughs]

1531
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:11,465
-Peter's been sick for a long time.
-Yeah.

1532
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,927
And a woman yearns for a man's touch.

1533
01:15:15,636 --> 01:15:17,138
Hey, no, that's natural.

1534
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,098
Are you a man, Sandy?

1535
01:15:20,183 --> 01:15:21,975
I don't know. I...

1536
01:15:22,060 --> 01:15:24,645
I was bar mitzvahed,
but that was a long time ago.

1537
01:15:24,728 --> 01:15:25,979
[laughs]

1538
01:15:27,565 --> 01:15:29,567
-You know what I love about you?
-Yeah?

1539
01:15:29,650 --> 01:15:31,860
-Your voice.
-[laughs]

1540
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,113
Come on. I've got a surprise.

1541
01:15:35,448 --> 01:15:36,574
-Come along.
-Hey, what's this?

1542
01:15:36,657 --> 01:15:38,951
-[stammers] Just sit here. Now, sit.
-Oh! Oh, yeah.

1543
01:15:39,035 --> 01:15:41,620
Aye, aye, aye! Yeah!

1544
01:15:41,704 --> 01:15:43,497
Touch me, Sandy. Touch me.

1545
01:15:43,581 --> 01:15:46,584
Well, I... I was just walking
on the carpet in my socks.

1546
01:15:46,667 --> 01:15:51,630
-I don't wanna zap you.
-Oh. You can zap me. Just zap me.

1547
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,882

[Peter whimpers]

1551
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:11,024
Don't worry about Peter.
He only wants my happiness.

1552
01:16:11,109 --> 01:16:12,360
Yeah.

1553
01:16:15,696 --> 01:16:16,947
[groaning]

1554
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:21,410
[stammers] I can't do it. I can't.

1555
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:23,954
-I'd feel better if we--
-Don't, Sandy, please.

1556
01:16:24,038 --> 01:16:26,540
-Don't leave. Stay here.
-Oh...

1557
01:16:26,624 --> 01:16:28,459
We... we could put a blanket
over his head.

1558
01:16:29,293 --> 01:16:33,256
-That's... that's actually a thought.
-[Peter groans]

1559
01:16:33,339 --> 01:16:36,008
No. He says no. He said... I'm sorry.

1560
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:39,220
[stammers] I consider Peter a friend,

1561
01:16:39,303 --> 01:16:43,141
whether he's alive or dead
or in a vegetative state.

1562
01:16:43,224 --> 01:16:45,601
Thanks for the offer, okay?

01:17:10,918 --> 01:17:13,045
-Doing too good a job. I feel that...
-[audience laughs]

1574

[Sandy laughs]

1575
01:17:14,505 --> 01:17:18,091
Just... a little bit overzealous
with the wrapping is my feeling.

1576
01:17:18,176 --> 01:17:21,470
-What is the security on this thing?
-[laughing]

1577
01:17:21,554 --> 01:17:22,846
It's a $12 item.

1578
01:17:22,930 --> 01:17:24,848
They got it wrapped up
like the Hope Diamond.

1579
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:27,768
It's impossible
that they have cellophane...

1580
01:17:27,851 --> 01:17:32,022
What are you doing? You look gloomy.
Reiser's killing out there. Come on.

1581
01:17:32,105 --> 01:17:34,775
You're like a monkey with a coconut.
You're just looking at it...

1582
01:17:34,858 --> 01:17:37,653
He's killing the jokes that I wrote.
It should be me up there killing it.

1583
01:17:37,736 --> 01:17:41,407
Next year, it will be.
CBS sees your jokes work now.

1584
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,327
Next year, you'll be telling those jokes,
'cause you wrote 'em.

1585
01:17:44,410 --> 01:17:46,119
[laughing]

1586
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,209
You want me to do the jokes
he's telling right now

1587
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:52,293
on next year's Grammys?

1588
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,170
But you do 'em in your voice.

1589
01:17:54,253 --> 01:17:56,672
But the punch lines are the same.
People have heard them already.

1590
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,299
You do new punch lines.

1591
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,509
So then they're new...
They're new jokes.

1592
01:18:00,593 --> 01:18:02,761
No, but you're doing 'em in your voice.

1593
01:18:02,845 --> 01:18:04,222
I wanna strangle you.

1594
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:05,806
-Don't say "your voice" again.
-What are you...

1595
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:07,558
I'm gonna kill you
if you say "in my voice."

1596
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:09,768
-Would you stop? I can't ever--
-Sandy?

1598
01:18:14,607 --> 01:18:16,359
Look at you!

1599
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:19,945
-Hey! Hey.
-Hey! Oh.

1600
01:18:21,739 --> 01:18:25,618
You, uh, remember my, uh,
client Paul Reiser?

1601
01:18:26,619 --> 01:18:28,746
-Kevin Connors.
-Kevin!

1602
01:18:29,455 --> 01:18:31,540
They should have had you host this show.

1603
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:35,669
Paul Reiser is usually funny,
but his jokes tonight are just corny.

1604
01:18:37,380 --> 01:18:39,673
-You still doing Atkins? I see.
-Atkins.

1605
01:18:39,757 --> 01:18:41,467
-You look great!
-Thank you. Well, my God.

1606
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:43,135
-I look good? Look at you.
-You look so good!

1607
01:18:43,219 --> 01:18:45,929
I have been following you.
You are doing so well.

1608
01:18:46,013 --> 01:18:49,600
The Grammy tonight. Did I tell you
when that was gonna happen, huh?

1609
01:18:49,683 --> 01:18:51,227
You deserve it all. You really do.

1610
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,605
You deserve it, too.
I wouldn't be here without you.

1611
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:57,775
Are you kidding me?
You cannot stop a shooting star.

1612
01:18:57,858 --> 01:18:59,735
-Aw.
-Our scientists have proven this.

1613
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,321
You are unbelievable, Sandy.

1614
01:19:02,405 --> 01:19:04,407
How's Bling? Where is he?

1615
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:07,660
Yeah, he's my label guy.
He's not my guy-guy anymore.

1616
01:19:07,743 --> 01:19:11,079
-Well, I'm so sorry. That's--
-Don't be.

1617
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:12,998
Things happen for a reason.

1618
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,625
I scored us each a goodie bag, my sweet.

1619
01:19:14,708 --> 01:19:16,960
-Hi, cuteness.
-Can I keep your PlayStation?

1620
01:19:17,044 --> 01:19:18,296
Yes.

1621
01:19:18,379 --> 01:19:24,009
Guys, this is my new boyfriend, Ra...
Say it for me, babe.

01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:25,511
Ramiro Alejandro.

1623

-Ramiro Alejandro.
-I know.

1625
01:19:31,267 --> 01:19:34,395
Oh, is this the old Make-A-Wish guy
you were telling me about?

1626
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:37,105
No. No, we used to work together.

1627
01:19:37,189 --> 01:19:40,150
Hey, you wanna come to Clive Davis'
after-party? You could ride with us.

1628
01:19:40,233 --> 01:19:42,069
I, uh, would love to.

1629
01:19:42,152 --> 01:19:44,405
-I, uh, have to go somewhere.
-[Courtney] Aw.

1630
01:19:44,488 --> 01:19:47,491
A client of mine... Amy Baskin.
You... you remember Amy.

1631
01:19:47,575 --> 01:19:48,576
Yeah!

1632
01:19:48,659 --> 01:19:52,913
Yes, well, she got the lead in
<i>Sound of Music</i> at the Pasadena Playhouse.

1633
01:19:52,996 --> 01:19:56,917
-She'll be Partygoer Number One.
-[laughs] Yeah, that's the lead.

1634
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,545
It is. She's... she's the lead partygoer.

1635
01:19:59,628 --> 01:20:02,798
Let's get together real soon, Sandy.
Promise me.

1636
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,759
-I promise. You promise me this.
-Of course. What?

1637
01:20:05,843 --> 01:20:07,177
-After Clive's party...
-Mmm-hmm.

1638
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,638
-...you put on the ugly duckling hat...
-Oh, gosh.

1639
01:20:09,722 --> 01:20:11,682
...and you remind yourself
where you came from.

1640
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,058
Not on this hair.

1641
01:20:13,141 --> 01:20:15,143
-Like we... Nope, not on your hair.
-[man] Courtney...

1642
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,729
-You promise?
-...we have to go.

1643
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:18,522
-I promise. Okay.
-I gotta see you. Okay.

1644
01:20:18,606 --> 01:20:20,399
[Courtney] Good to see you, babe.

1645
01:20:20,483 --> 01:20:23,944
Nice meeting you, Sammy!
Hope they find a cure for you, buddy.

1646
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:25,821
Buddy, move. Move!

1647
01:20:25,904 --> 01:20:27,656
-Get out the way!
-Which way are you moving?

1648
01:20:27,740 --> 01:20:28,866
-Okay, go!
-Sandy, move! Sandy!

1649
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,743
That was another tough goodbye for Sandy.

1650
01:20:30,826 --> 01:20:34,121
He... he didn't even know if he
would ever see or talk to Courtney again.

1651
01:20:34,204 --> 01:20:35,664
Of course he kept himself busy.

1652
01:20:35,748 --> 01:20:37,249
He actually signed someone

1653
01:20:37,333 --> 01:20:40,210
who was involved in the biggest form
of entertainment in the '90s.

1654
01:20:40,293 --> 01:20:41,795
Wrestling. Professional wrestling.

take the title on Sunday.

-I'm gonna make 'em go night-night.

-Thank you.
-I'm gonna lose.

1665
01:21:33,847 --> 01:21:35,724
You don't know that. Hang on, please.

1666
01:21:35,808 --> 01:21:38,727
Yeah, I do know that. I got the script.

1667
01:21:38,811 --> 01:21:42,440
Tsunami sits on my face until I tap out.
I'm never gonna be the champ.

1668
01:21:42,523 --> 01:21:43,691
Okay, look.

1669
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:47,820
The good thing is, you're gonna have
a grown man sit on your face

1670
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:51,156
and the entire world is gonna be watching.
That's a positive.

1671
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:53,325
-That's not a positive.
-It's a positive because it's...

1672
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,702
-The fame factor.
-What?

1673
01:21:54,785 --> 01:21:57,955
Hey, Bedtime. Will you rock me like a baby
while my brother Dicky gets a picture?

1674
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,957
-What are you, six?
-Yeah, of course he will.

1675
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:02,167
-Of course he will do it.
-Do you see the size of this guy?

1676
01:22:02,250 --> 01:22:03,293
Just get on it.

1677
01:22:03,376 --> 01:22:07,297
Oh. Hang on, guys.
My cellular device is ringing.

1678
01:22:08,048 --> 01:22:10,383
And I hit this, and I pull this.

1679
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:12,344
Wexler Artists.

1680
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,847
Mr. Wexler, it is Chippy from Dan Tana's.

1681
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:19,685
Chippy! Hey! How's it going?
How was your vacation to Cincinnati?

1682
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,395
It was, uh, not a vacation.
My mother died.

1683
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,022
I went to Cincinnati for the funeral.

1684
01:22:24,106 --> 01:22:26,358
Oh, yeah. That's right. How's your mother?

1685
01:22:26,442 --> 01:22:27,901
[stammering]

1686
01:22:27,985 --> 01:22:29,194
What are you calling for?

1687
01:22:29,277 --> 01:22:32,990
We have a delicate situation with a client
of yours who has had too much to drink.

1688
01:22:33,073 --> 01:22:35,826
And unfortunately,
there are very many paparazzi out front.

1689
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:36,952
[clamoring]

1690
01:22:37,035 --> 01:22:39,204
Oh, boy. Was it Gary or Kevin?

1691
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:40,456
-[bones crack]
-[man groans]

1692
01:22:44,376 --> 01:22:46,336
[man] Yeah, I chased him
for six or seven blocks.

1693
01:22:46,419 --> 01:22:50,173
Just come on. Get a life, guys. Jeez.

1694
01:22:54,177 --> 01:22:56,346
[indistinct chatter]

1695
01:22:56,429 --> 01:22:58,223
-Bring me to the package.
-This way.

1696
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:09,026
Courtney?

1697
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,446
What the... What's going on, kiddo?

1698
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,324
Sandy! They found you!

1699
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,868
Yeah, they found me.

1700
01:23:17,951 --> 01:23:21,288
You just stay put, okay?
You stay right there.

1701
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:24,750
[exclaims]

1702
01:23:26,084 --> 01:23:28,462
Aw, Sandy to the rescue.

1703
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:32,675
No one can find out about this.
You understand me, Chippy? Not even you.

1704
01:23:33,717 --> 01:23:34,885
[scoffs] Okay, Sandy.

1705
01:23:36,303 --> 01:23:37,763
-[grunts] Okay.
-Sandy!

1706
01:23:39,807 --> 01:23:42,810
What? She'll suffocate?
Is that what you're saying?

1707
01:23:42,893 --> 01:23:45,353
[all chanting]
Courtney! Courtney! Courtney!

1708
01:23:45,437 --> 01:23:47,314
[Sandy] Go jump in a lake, fellas!

1709
01:23:51,401 --> 01:23:52,986
[dogs barking]

1710
01:23:53,070 --> 01:23:57,741
Ah! No, no, no, no! Oh, come on!
Oh, please, please, please.

1711
01:23:58,951 --> 01:24:01,494
Keep your voices down. Let her sleep.

1712
01:24:03,121 --> 01:24:06,625
That's right. Just sleep. Sleep, sleep.

1713
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,545
Let me get this up for you.

1714
01:24:10,462 --> 01:24:13,131
And you... you're breathing.

1715
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:15,050
Are you breathing?

1716
01:24:15,759 --> 01:24:17,761
Yeah, there it is. Okay.

1717
01:24:17,845 --> 01:24:18,929
You'll be all right.

1718
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,893
[Sandy] I'm telling you, he's the best
ventriloquist in the business. He...

1719
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,436
[woman] <i>You don't see him talking?</i>

1720
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:31,441
No, you see his lips move slightly,
but that's not the important thing.

1721
01:24:31,524 --> 01:24:34,069
The important thing
is what the guy is saying.

1722
01:24:34,152 --> 01:24:37,197
No one looks at the lips
if they're laughing, then...

1723
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:38,949
No, kids love him.

1724
01:24:39,032 --> 01:24:42,786
[stammers] That's why I'm bringing it up
to you. The kids will love this guy.

1725
01:24:42,870 --> 01:24:46,373
He's got curly hair,
and... and he's got the mustache.

1726
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:47,457
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1727
01:24:47,540 --> 01:24:50,502
-Linda, I'm... I'm just asking if you...
-Do you want some breakfast?

1728
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,504
<i>-Sandy...</i>
-If you could just

1729
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,547
put a good word in for me. That's it.

1730
01:24:54,632 --> 01:24:56,717
Maybe put his headshot on his desk.

1731
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,136
<i>-I really wish I could, Sandy.</i>
-Hey, just meat, right?

1732
01:24:59,219 --> 01:25:01,554
Oh, yeah. Hold on. Just meat.

1733
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:03,766
Just meet with him.

1734
01:25:04,474 --> 01:25:06,852
That's all I'm asking you to do.
Just meet with him.

1735
01:25:06,935 --> 01:25:08,103
<i>All right, Sandy.</i>

1736
01:25:08,186 --> 01:25:11,564
Thank you, Linda! Thank you!

1737
01:25:11,649 --> 01:25:13,525
Happy birthday on Wednesday.

1738
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:15,903
<i>-How did you know that?</i>
-Yeah, 'cause I know.

1739
01:25:15,986 --> 01:25:18,238
'Cause I know. I know everything.

1740
01:25:20,073 --> 01:25:22,618
How good is this? Phenomenal.

1741
01:25:22,701 --> 01:25:24,662
No one knows
how to cook health food like...

1742
01:25:24,745 --> 01:25:27,205
You're fantastic. You can do it all.

1743
01:25:27,915 --> 01:25:31,293
I owe you for last night.
I'm embarrassed.

1744
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,462
Hey, everybody gets zonked
once in a while.

1745
01:25:34,546 --> 01:25:36,924
The question is, why are we doing it?

1746
01:25:38,175 --> 01:25:39,593
I don't know. I...

1747
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,594
I just broke up with Billy.

1748
01:25:41,679 --> 01:25:45,432
Billy? Who's Billy?
What happened to the Marc Anthony fella?

1749
01:25:45,515 --> 01:25:47,059
Marc Anthony? Come on, Sandy.

1750
01:25:47,142 --> 01:25:49,687
Pick up a <i>People</i> magazine
every once in a while.

1751
01:25:49,770 --> 01:25:51,855
That was three boyfriends ago.

1752
01:25:51,939 --> 01:25:55,525
Oh, hey, I gotta start writing
some of these names down.

1753
01:25:55,608 --> 01:25:58,737
I'm getting lost.
I'm joking around with you.

1754
01:25:58,821 --> 01:26:01,239
What you're doing's perfectly natural.

1755
01:26:01,323 --> 01:26:03,742
Anyone in your position
would be doing the same.

1756
01:26:03,826 --> 01:26:05,160
Look, Liza did it.

1757
01:26:05,869 --> 01:26:08,956
Elizabeth Taylor did it.
Sherwood Schwartz did it.

1758
01:26:09,039 --> 01:26:11,583
[sighs] Just my life.

1759
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:14,419
It feels out of control.

1760
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:18,882
I can't connect with anybody.
I don't... I just don't feel safe.

1761
01:26:18,966 --> 01:26:20,926
I can't even go ten feet

1762
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:25,806
without the paparazzi following me,
taking pictures of me, spying on me.

1763
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:27,390
I don't even want to
leave my house anymore.

1764
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,101
What? You gotta leave your house.

1765
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:32,062
Even Michael Jackson
leaves his house once in a while.

1766
01:26:32,813 --> 01:26:33,647
How?

1767
01:26:33,731 --> 01:26:36,734
He just don't look like Michael Jackson.

1768
01:26:40,570 --> 01:26:42,655
Excuse me, sir.
You know what time it is?

1769
01:26:42,740 --> 01:26:44,867
[laughing]

1770
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:47,160
Can you do me a favor?

1771
01:26:47,244 --> 01:26:50,789
Courtney Clarke was just in there.
Uh, could you find out where she went?

1772
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:53,625
This is...
Somebody just got their life back!

1773
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:56,378
-[laughs]
-Why do you own this stuff?

1774
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,839
Why? Those are my workout clothes.

1775
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:00,799
You work out? [laughs]

1776
01:27:00,883 --> 01:27:04,928
Suzanne Somers personally gave me
one of the very first ThighMasters.

1777
01:27:05,012 --> 01:27:06,263
I use it as much as I can.

1778
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,015
This conversation is over.

1779
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:10,392
What? It's for firm thighs and buttocks.

1780
01:27:10,475 --> 01:27:12,936
-Sandy, please stop talking.
-All right.

1781
01:27:13,686 --> 01:27:14,772
What we gonna do today?

1782
01:27:14,855 --> 01:27:17,733
What we gonna do today?
Anything you want, kiddo.

1783
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:20,861
-Okay, lead the way, ThighMaster.
-Hey! Now, wait a minute.

1784
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:23,864
-By the way, the dogs are good for cardio.
-Oh.

1785
01:27:24,907 --> 01:27:25,908
What does that mean?

1786
01:27:25,991 --> 01:27:27,159
-You'll see.
-[dogs barking]

1787
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:29,995
-[Sandy] Go! Run! Run! Run!
-Okay! Okay!

1788
01:27:31,872 --> 01:27:33,581
[Sandy] Well, here comes the test.

1789
01:27:34,792 --> 01:27:37,585
Look at that. Look at that. Huh?

1790
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:39,254
-[laughs]
-Wow.

1791
01:27:40,798 --> 01:27:42,215
Why am I golfing?

1792
01:27:42,299 --> 01:27:44,134
Golfing is very relaxing.

1793
01:27:44,217 --> 01:27:47,512
You don't have to think
about nothing but smacking that ball.

1794
01:27:47,595 --> 01:27:49,306
Have you ever played before?

1795
01:27:49,389 --> 01:27:52,225
-No.
-No? It's quite easy.

1796
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:55,687
I'll take out the big stick
'cause it's fun to hit 'em far.

1797
01:27:55,771 --> 01:27:59,316
It's always good to warm up a little bit.
Ow! Okay.

1798
01:27:59,399 --> 01:28:02,235
I got actually a little problem
in the back.

1799
01:28:02,319 --> 01:28:04,696
-You okay?
-Yeah. Just give me one sec.

1800
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:05,781
God damn it.

1801
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:07,699
-Should I call for help?
-No, I'll be all right.

1802
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,993
Just give me one sec.
I just gotta stretch.

1803
01:28:11,787 --> 01:28:14,915
All right. Just give me one more sec.
I do need help.

1804
01:28:22,089 --> 01:28:23,631
You need to go to the bathroom?

1805
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:26,259
No, I'm just... I'm getting it lined up.

1806
01:28:27,385 --> 01:28:30,931
Let's just say goodbye
to all our troubles, okay?

1807
01:28:31,014 --> 01:28:32,015
Okay.

1808
01:28:32,099 --> 01:28:35,102
If you got any problems,
put 'em into the ball and send them away.

1809
01:28:37,604 --> 01:28:40,357
Is it supposed to curve
off to the right like that?

1810
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,609
Yeah, I was playing a dogleg right.

1811
01:28:42,692 --> 01:28:44,402
-A dogleg?
-Right.

1812
01:28:44,486 --> 01:28:47,489
You gotta bend it around the trees,
and that's what I was going for.

1813
01:28:47,572 --> 01:28:49,657
-Can I try it?
-You wanna try? Okay.

1814
01:28:49,741 --> 01:28:51,701
I was gonna show you
a little more, but okay.

1815
01:28:51,784 --> 01:28:53,370
-Okay.
-So let me...

1816
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,163
You know, maybe you should
tee it up for yourself.

1817
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:56,539
Tee it up. Here.

1818
01:28:56,623 --> 01:28:59,001
-You tee it up, and you say goodbye.
-Right here.

1819
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,085
Okay.

1820
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,045
And just have a good time
and don't worry about where it goes.

1821
01:29:02,129 --> 01:29:03,839
-Let's see.
-Okay.

1822
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:11,179
Am I being hustled right now?
What was that?

1823
01:29:11,263 --> 01:29:15,350
I swear I didn't play every day growing up
with my Uncle Davey who's a golf pro.

1824
01:29:15,433 --> 01:29:17,227
-Oh, well...
-[Courtney laughs]

1825
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:19,855
Does this guy need a manager because...

1826
01:29:19,938 --> 01:29:21,773
-Come over here.
-What are we doing?

1827
01:29:21,857 --> 01:29:23,108
We gotta work on that slice leg.

1828
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:24,692
-Oh, my God.
-Here you go. Here you go.

1829
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:26,904
-This is your day. I don't want to...
-No. No, no, no. You got it?

1830
01:29:26,987 --> 01:29:29,322
-You're okay with it? [laughs]
-Oh, it's my day now. Come on.

1831
01:29:29,406 --> 01:29:30,615
-In the hips.
-In the hips.

1832
01:29:30,698 --> 01:29:31,699
Here we go.

1833
01:29:31,783 --> 01:29:34,494
Oh! All right! Hold on now. [laughs]

1834
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:37,705
Huh? I beg your pardon?

1835
01:29:37,789 --> 01:29:38,790
[Sandy] Tell me. Tell me.

1836
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:40,000
[Courtney] A company called Pixar...

1837
01:29:40,083 --> 01:29:41,334
-[Sandy] Pixar?
-...wants me to do a voice

1838
01:29:41,418 --> 01:29:43,545
in some animated movie
about a bunch of toys.

1839
01:29:43,628 --> 01:29:45,005
[Sandy] Cartoons are dead.

1840
01:29:45,088 --> 01:29:46,589
-Tell 'em pass.
-[Courtney chuckles]

1841
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:49,176
-Okay. Sandy knows best.
-I mean, come on. I do know best.

1842
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:53,555
The lady at Chili's said they'll keep it
open till 10:30 for us, so that's good.

1843
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:54,973
How you feeling anyway?

1844
01:29:55,057 --> 01:29:56,141
As good as anybody can feel

1845
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:58,393
knowing they're about to get
their face sat on by that guy.

1846
01:29:59,352 --> 01:30:00,562
Damn, that's a big ass!

1847
01:30:00,645 --> 01:30:02,272
-That's right--
-Get off me!

1848
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:05,442
Listen. Will you just trust me?
This is a good night for you.

1849
01:30:05,525 --> 01:30:06,651
Trust you? It's humiliating.

1850
01:30:06,734 --> 01:30:09,446
My kids are out there, man!
My wife might not ever kiss me again!

1851
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:12,490
Randy Savage had to get whooped 24 times

1852
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,868
before he finally pinned Ted DiBiase
to win the belt, man!

1853
01:30:15,953 --> 01:30:18,455
How does your platinum-selling ass
know about wrestling history?

1854
01:30:18,538 --> 01:30:21,708
I'm from Alaska.
It was either watch wrestling or fish.

1855
01:30:21,791 --> 01:30:23,376
Is that adorable?

1856
01:30:23,460 --> 01:30:26,379
Will you just take it all in
and promise me you'll have fun?

1857
01:30:26,463 --> 01:30:28,923
This is a big night for you.
Look at me.

1858
01:30:29,007 --> 01:30:31,593
Man, how does your goofy ass
have me feeling good right now?

1859
01:30:31,676 --> 01:30:32,677
That's impossible!

1860
01:30:32,760 --> 01:30:35,472
Because you know I love ya
and I'm your family.

1861
01:30:35,555 --> 01:30:37,224
All right, good luck.

1862
01:30:37,307 --> 01:30:38,641
Get out there!

1863
01:30:40,352 --> 01:30:41,936
[crowd cheering]

1864
01:30:43,271 --> 01:30:44,647
Yeah! Come on!

1865
01:30:53,823 --> 01:30:55,908
-[referee] Fight!
-[bell ringing]

1866
01:30:55,993 --> 01:30:57,035
[Bobby yelling]

1867
01:30:59,204 --> 01:31:00,288
Okay.

1868
01:31:00,372 --> 01:31:01,914
[Tsunami exclaiming]

1869
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:09,547
[crowd groans]

1870
01:31:10,507 --> 01:31:12,092
[exclaims]

1871
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:17,847
No!

1872
01:31:17,930 --> 01:31:19,849
[exclaiming]

1873
01:31:22,727 --> 01:31:24,688
[yelling]

1874
01:31:24,771 --> 01:31:26,064
Break, break, break, break!

1875
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:29,817
Hey, what are you doing?
Stick to the script.

1876
01:31:29,901 --> 01:31:31,736
I'm sorry, Tsunami.
You're gonna have to earn this one.

1877
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,030
What? Hey...

1878
01:31:34,406 --> 01:31:36,074
[crowd clamoring]

1879
01:31:37,325 --> 01:31:39,952
This is bullshit.
I'm supposed to win.

1880
01:31:40,037 --> 01:31:42,622
This happening?
Huh, this is happening?

1881
01:31:42,705 --> 01:31:43,790
Well, bring it on!

1882
01:31:43,873 --> 01:31:44,916
[yells]

1883
01:31:49,837 --> 01:31:51,839
Okay, get back there, champ!

1884
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,509
-[yells]
-[groans]

1885
01:31:54,592 --> 01:31:56,636
There it is. Now it's getting real.

1886
01:31:56,719 --> 01:31:58,305
[both grunting]

1887
01:32:00,807 --> 01:32:02,016
Thank you very much!

1888
01:32:06,563 --> 01:32:07,439
What is this?

1889
01:32:15,197 --> 01:32:17,532
No, you're not! What's going on here?

1890
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:27,917
Say it!

1891
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:30,212
It's time to go night-night!

1892
01:32:32,755 --> 01:32:34,341
[crowd cheering]

1893
01:32:39,846 --> 01:32:41,013
[bell dings]

1894
01:32:41,098 --> 01:32:43,100
[crowd cheering]

1895
01:32:46,018 --> 01:32:47,229
[yells]

1896
01:32:50,440 --> 01:32:53,151
-I got the belt! I'm the champ! [laughs]
-[man] You the man! You the man!

1897
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:56,028
-Sandy! How?
-What do you... Huh?

1898
01:32:56,613 --> 01:33:01,784
The referee is a client, and
Wexler Artists look out for each other.

1899
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:04,078
Oh, man!
Those guys are gonna fire his ass!

1900
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:05,705
Of course they are,

1901
01:33:05,788 --> 01:33:09,667
but I already got him a job as a referee
for the Harlem Globetrotters.

1902
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:12,086
-I know. I understand.
-You're never going to work again!

1903
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:14,547
What do you say, champ? Proud of ya.

1904
01:33:15,465 --> 01:33:18,135
Oh! I'm so happy, Sandy!

1905
01:33:18,218 --> 01:33:21,721
I love you. This is your moment.
This is all you.

1906
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:24,432
I'm just so happy for you
and your wife and your kids.

1907
01:33:24,516 --> 01:33:25,767
Okay? That's all I want.

1908
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:28,186
-I love you! I love you!
-You deserve everything!

1909
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:30,980
-Courtney, get in here!
-You deserve everything!

1910
01:33:31,063 --> 01:33:32,774
Uh, we do have to go to Chili's, though.

1911
01:33:32,857 --> 01:33:35,527
I told the lady we'd be there
by 10:30, so let's get going.

1912
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:38,112
-Why are you talking about Chili's now?
-I just don't wanna...

1913
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,324
I don't want her to screw us
for the next time, you know. Let's go.

1914
01:33:55,338 --> 01:33:57,965
[Sandy] Eat up those baby backs, guys.

1915
01:33:59,884 --> 01:34:04,806
How do you take care of everybody
and never worry about yourself?

1916
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:07,767
How do you become Sandy?

1917
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:09,394
Oh, well, listen.

1918
01:34:09,477 --> 01:34:13,064
How do you get to Carnegie Hall?
Practice, practice, practice.

1919
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,774
-Hmm. [chuckles]
-Huh?

1920
01:34:17,610 --> 01:34:19,779
I wish I could stay here.

1921
01:34:19,862 --> 01:34:22,657
This is the best day I've had in years.

1922
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:27,119
Listen, you can stay as long as you want.

1923
01:34:28,205 --> 01:34:30,373
I'm supposed to go to New York tomorrow

1924
01:34:30,457 --> 01:34:33,418
and shoot this VH1 thing
with Lenny Kravitz.

1925
01:34:34,168 --> 01:34:35,169
Yeah?

1926
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:37,755
That's a good thing.

1927
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:39,841
Is it?

1928
01:34:41,384 --> 01:34:42,719
Then why don't I wanna go?

1929
01:34:48,308 --> 01:34:49,767
Tell me I don't have to go, Sandy.

1930
01:34:51,728 --> 01:34:53,355
No, no, no.

1931
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:55,898
Why won't you?

1932
01:34:57,400 --> 01:34:59,902
'Cause that's not my job anymore.

1933
01:35:01,070 --> 01:35:02,447
Okay.

1934
01:35:03,281 --> 01:35:04,782
What do you want me to do?

1935
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:12,457
What I want you to do
is concentrate on your career.

1936
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:14,208
Music comes first.

1937
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,003
Go to New York.

1938
01:35:21,508 --> 01:35:24,135
-You know what? [scoffs]
-What?

1939
01:35:25,970 --> 01:35:27,555
You're a jerk.

1940
01:35:37,357 --> 01:35:39,150
[Firuz] <i>Oh, God, yes!</i>

1941
01:35:40,360 --> 01:35:41,819
What was that?

1942
01:35:42,695 --> 01:35:45,031
-Firuz!
<i>-Oh, all right, then.</i>

1943
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:46,824
<i>I'll go take a walk or something.</i>

1944
01:35:47,534 --> 01:35:49,661
<i>Have the best night of your life, Sandy.</i>

1945
01:35:50,787 --> 01:35:52,246
I'm trying.

1946
01:35:54,832 --> 01:35:57,001
Ultimately, I have to move.

1947
01:36:34,664 --> 01:36:37,834
[Courtney]
<i>The day was perfect, the night was better.</i>

1948
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:40,420
<i>Thank you. I'm off to New York.</i>

1949
01:36:40,503 --> 01:36:42,339
<i>Sandy knows best.</i>

1950
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:43,673
<i>Love, Court.</i>

1951
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:54,100
<i>-Pick that up!</i>
-Shut up, Firuz!

1952
01:36:57,311 --> 01:36:58,980
Just shut up.

1953
01:36:59,063 --> 01:37:00,732
Success can be really lonely.

1954
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:03,443
That's why you kinda long
for someone to share it with.

1955
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:06,028
So a week later,
her and Lenny Kravitz moved in together.

1956
01:37:06,112 --> 01:37:08,698
And then two weeks later after that,
moved out.

1957
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:10,116
And she moved on to Johnny Depp.

1958
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:11,409
-Chris Cornell.
-George Clooney.

1959
01:37:11,493 --> 01:37:13,327
-Ziggy Marley.
-Pauly Shore.

1960
01:37:13,411 --> 01:37:15,037
I went out with her?

1961
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:17,415
Man, Sandy was messed up.

1962
01:37:18,750 --> 01:37:20,418
[man] Sir, are you committing suicide?

1963
01:37:20,502 --> 01:37:22,504
'Cause I don't think
I'm allowed to film that!

1964
01:37:22,587 --> 01:37:24,213
No, I'm not!

1965
01:37:24,296 --> 01:37:26,466
I'm fine, thank you very much!

1966
01:37:26,549 --> 01:37:30,302
She can date whoever she wants to date!
That's her thing!

1967
01:37:30,387 --> 01:37:32,930
-He's talking to me.
-He's talking to you?

1968
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:43,232
Sandy, that pool looks far away.
How long until my skin starts burning?

1969
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:49,155
I think the safety advisor

You had a minor heart attack.
A warning shot.

2126
01:46:02,606 --> 01:46:05,109
Probably due to stress. And meat.

Here you go.

A store that just sells coffee?
I don't know.

That ain't gonna work, kid.

I just need a... a break from the music.

But singing's the only thing
that makes you happy.
