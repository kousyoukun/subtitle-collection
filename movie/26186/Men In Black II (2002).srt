1
00:00:22,618 --> 00:00:26,781
Mysteries in History,
with your host, Peter Graves.

2
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:30,892
Although no one has ever been able
to prove their existence...

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,188
... a quasi-government agency,
the Men in Black...

4
00:00:34,364 --> 00:00:37,697
... supposedly carries out operations
here on Earth...

5
00:00:37,866 --> 00:00:41,963
... in order to keep us safe from aliens
throughout the galaxies.

6
00:00:42,137 --> 00:00:45,630
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"...

7
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:50,005
... from one of their files
that doesn't exist.

8
00:00:50,612 --> 00:00:54,777
1978. The leaders of Zartha
flee their planet...

9
00:00:54,950 --> 00:01:00,183
... in order to escape the clutches
of the evil Kylothian, Serleena.

10
00:01:00,689 --> 00:01:04,592
Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring
with them their greatest treasure:

11
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:08,988
The Light of Zartha,
a cosmic force so powerful...

12
00:01:09,164 --> 00:01:13,693
... that in the wrong hands it could
lead to the annihilation of Zartha.

13
00:01:14,202 --> 00:01:17,604
The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna,
beseeched the Men in Black...

14
00:01:17,773 --> 00:01:20,140
... to hide the Light from Serleena.

15
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:22,610
But they had no choice.

16
00:01:22,779 --> 00:01:26,271
Intervention would have meant
the destruction of the Earth.

17
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:32,747
However, in an act of galactic bravery,
the Men in Black subdued Serleena...

18
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:35,151
... allowing the Zarthans to escape...

19
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:38,987
... so they might hide the Light
on another planet.

20
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:44,792
Serleena, released from her captors,
vowed that the Light would be hers...

21
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:49,869
... and that she would destroy
any planet that stood in her way.

22
00:01:51,074 --> 00:01:53,838
And so, never knowing what happened...

23
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:59,208
... the people of Earth were saved
by a secret society of protectors...

24
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:02,441
... known as the Men in Black.

25
00:03:41,617 --> 00:03:43,481
Harvey!

26
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:47,111
Harvey, get over here!

27
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:49,784
Harvey. Heel, heel!

28
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,189
You're barking at the moon, moron.

29
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:54,123
Harvey. Harvey!

30
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,248
Hey, pretty lady.

31
00:05:58,186 --> 00:05:59,882
You taste good.

32
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,322
Hey, what the--?

33
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:12,832
Yeah, you too.

34
00:07:01,883 --> 00:07:04,351
Nothing fancy, no heroics.
By the book.

35
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,986
Got it. Hey!

36
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,455
Hey, Jeff. What's happening, buddy?

37
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:13,584
- We were wondering why you're here.
- The man's talking to you.

38
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:18,024
You know our arrangements.
Stay in the E, F and R subway lines...

39
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,633
... and you get all the garbage
you want.

40
00:07:20,803 --> 00:07:23,567
What the hell are you doing here,
worm boy?

41
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:24,727
Tee.

42
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,671
Jeff... .

43
00:07:26,842 --> 00:07:29,036
Excuse my partner.
He's new and he's...

44
00:07:30,246 --> 00:07:35,250
... kind of stupid.

45
00:07:42,892 --> 00:07:45,861
You getting big, Jeff.
Boy, what you been eating?

46
00:07:50,032 --> 00:07:51,829
You like jokes, huh?

47
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,996
Jeffrey!

48
00:08:03,077 --> 00:08:04,306
All right.

49
00:08:05,781 --> 00:08:07,611
Sweet dreams, big boy.

50
00:08:42,651 --> 00:08:44,209
Sweet dreams...

51
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,425
... big boy.

52
00:08:50,593 --> 00:08:53,357
Transit authority.
Move to the forward car.

53
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:56,123
We got a bug in the electrical system.

54
00:08:58,166 --> 00:09:03,229
People! We got a bug
in the electrical system!

55
00:09:07,075 --> 00:09:08,771
Now y'all running?

56
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:10,638
No, no, no! Sit down!

57
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,781
It's only a 600-foot worm.

58
00:09:16,051 --> 00:09:20,112
- Everybody out.
- Put the hammer down on this thing.

59
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:23,747
I'm Captain Larry Bridgewater.
I decide what happens.

60
00:09:23,926 --> 00:09:26,554
You decide?
Okay, come here. Come here.

61
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:28,787
Larry? That's my man, Jeff.

62
00:09:32,133 --> 00:09:36,297
- Larry just made a decision.
- Larry need to take his ass in there.

63
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:46,280
Don't make me do this, Jeff!

64
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:13,937
Eighty-first Street.

65
00:10:18,012 --> 00:10:19,138
Just a second.

66
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:23,315
May I have your attention, please?

67
00:10:23,852 --> 00:10:26,719
We thank you
for participating in our drill.

68
00:10:26,888 --> 00:10:29,949
Had this been an emergency,
you'd have been eaten.

69
00:10:30,124 --> 00:10:32,685
Because you don't listen.
You're ignorant.

70
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,025
How a man gonna bash through--?
That's the problem with New Yorkers.

71
00:10:37,199 --> 00:10:40,828
"We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm!
Save us, Mr. Black Man!"

72
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:45,200
I ask you nice, "Move to the next car. "
You just sit there like--

73
00:10:47,142 --> 00:10:48,802
Thank you for participating.

74
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:52,879
Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller,
energy-efficient subway cars.

75
00:10:53,349 --> 00:10:56,442
Watch your step.
You will have a nice evening.

76
00:11:00,022 --> 00:11:03,617
I need a cleanup crew
at 81st and Central Park West.

77
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:06,282
Revoke Jeff's movement privileges.

78
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:09,295
Have him escorted
to the Chamber Street station.

79
00:11:09,464 --> 00:11:14,425
And please check the expiration date
on the unipod worm tranquilizers.

80
00:11:18,773 --> 00:11:20,604
Sorry, fellas. Station closed.

81
00:11:20,908 --> 00:11:25,141
- Emergency drill. For your safety.
- Do you believe these putzes?

82
00:11:26,748 --> 00:11:28,238
You're welcome.

83
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:44,160
I know, by the book.

84
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:48,792
Tee, when was the last time
we just looked at the stars?

85
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,963
This is a test. I can do this.

86
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,969
Ever feel like you're alone
in the universe?

87
00:11:57,146 --> 00:11:58,636
Yes.

88
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:02,276
No.

89
00:12:04,552 --> 00:12:07,579
- Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie.
- Really?

90
00:12:08,323 --> 00:12:09,551
Thanks.

91
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:13,089
Hey, you're not alone
in the universe.

92
00:12:13,262 --> 00:12:15,456
- Remove the arm.
- Okay.

93
00:12:16,431 --> 00:12:16,464
Please, shut up, Charlie.

94
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:21,469
Please, shut up, Charlie.

95
00:12:21,536 --> 00:12:24,335
I'm tired of you constantly talking
behind my back.

96
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:29,975
You meet a girl. She's into it.
The best line you come up with is:

97
00:12:30,144 --> 00:12:34,275
"Wanna come back to my place for some
tonsil hockey and egg salad?"

98
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:38,108
- Who are you and how'd you get in here?
- You like egg salad?

99
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:42,788
Serleena!

100
00:12:42,958 --> 00:12:46,189
Why didn't you say it was you?

101
00:12:46,994 --> 00:12:49,555
- Where's the Light?
- Here's the deal.

102
00:12:49,732 --> 00:12:52,098
You're looking for this Light.
We found it.

103
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:56,566
You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill.
Here's how it'll work. First--

104
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:59,674
Where is the Light?

105
00:13:04,613 --> 00:13:08,946
We couldn't find it, but we found
a guy who might know where it is.

106
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:12,177
He runs a pizza parlor
on Spring Street.

107
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:17,323
Let's go. And wipe your nose, idiot.

108
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:26,495
- Good pie.
- Yeah.

109
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,493
Crowded.

110
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:31,434
Well, they got good pie.

111
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,243
What is wrong with you?

112
00:13:38,412 --> 00:13:40,608
- You're gonna neuralyze me.
- No, I'm not.

113
00:13:40,782 --> 00:13:43,343
You took me here
so I wouldn't make a scene.

114
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,315
You making a scene.

115
00:13:46,021 --> 00:13:49,354
Let me ask you a question.
Why did you join MiB?

116
00:13:49,525 --> 00:13:53,051
Six years in the Marines.
I like the action. Protect the planet.

117
00:13:53,228 --> 00:13:56,527
You like being a hero?
You joined the wrong organization.

118
00:13:57,232 --> 00:14:00,690
- You ever heard of James Edwards?
- No.

119
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:04,867
Well, he saved the lives of 85 people
on the subway tonight.

120
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,065
No one knows he exists.

121
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:12,479
And if no one knows he exists,
how can anyone ever love him?

122
00:14:16,251 --> 00:14:18,480
Hey, how long we been partners?

123
00:14:18,653 --> 00:14:21,623
- Feb 1.
- Five months, three days.

124
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,485
- Started at noon.
- Nine hours.

125
00:14:31,532 --> 00:14:34,001
Get married. Have a bunch of kids.

126
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:36,163
Okay.

127
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:44,435
Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy,
but he thinks you are hot.

128
00:14:49,785 --> 00:14:50,773
Here it is.

129
00:14:52,387 --> 00:14:53,854
I don't know what to say.

130
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:56,956
Years from now,
you know what people'll say?

131
00:14:57,124 --> 00:15:00,458
- "Employee" is misspelled?
- They charge by the letter.

132
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:04,758
They'll say, "lmagine that. Big shot
like her used to work here. "

133
00:15:04,932 --> 00:15:06,331
- Ben--
- You deserve it.

134
00:15:06,501 --> 00:15:09,628
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew
from the basement.

135
00:15:12,407 --> 00:15:14,204
Hey, Bruno.

136
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,738
Two slices of pepperoni and
information about the Light of Zartha.

137
00:15:19,915 --> 00:15:23,282
- Whoever you are, don't hurt me.
- Where's the Light, Ben?

138
00:15:23,451 --> 00:15:26,887
I don't know what you're talking about.
Let me down, ma'am.

139
00:15:27,055 --> 00:15:29,147
I want to report a robbery--

140
00:15:36,632 --> 00:15:38,224
There.

141
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,061
Noise.

142
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:43,036
Kitchen!

143
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:49,134
You idiots see anything?

144
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:52,336
Wind blew the door open.

145
00:15:53,014 --> 00:15:54,983
Nothing out of the ordinary.

146
00:15:55,349 --> 00:15:58,478
For 25 years, I've traveled
the universe looking for it.

147
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:01,589
But it never left Earth, did it?
You kept it here.

148
00:16:01,757 --> 00:16:03,485
What are you talking about?

149
00:16:03,658 --> 00:16:06,184
I'm running out of time.
Where's the Light?

150
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:09,158
- I don't know what you mean.
- Listen, Zarthan.

151
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,891
You hid the Light on Earth.
I'll find it.

152
00:16:12,066 --> 00:16:15,594
Once we have the Light,
Zartha will be ours.

153
00:16:15,771 --> 00:16:18,330
You're too late.
Tomorrow at midnight...

154
00:16:18,507 --> 00:16:22,033
... the Light will leave
the third planet and be back home.

155
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:25,474
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.

156
00:16:34,756 --> 00:16:37,315
Now we don't know
if it's on Earth or not.

157
00:16:37,492 --> 00:16:39,892
He said third planet.
It's here, you idiot.

158
00:16:40,061 --> 00:16:43,758
- Third Rock from the Sun.
- I never got that till now.

159
00:16:44,266 --> 00:16:48,133
It's on Earth, and I know
who's gonna tell me where it is.

160
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,623
- Don't you ever go home?
- Nope.

161
00:17:15,796 --> 00:17:18,594
I see you neuralyzed another partner.

162
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,835
Bee, Dee, when you use
a fission carbonizer...

163
00:17:28,009 --> 00:17:31,740
... attach a de-atomizer
so it doesn't sound like a cannon.

164
00:17:31,912 --> 00:17:36,212
Hey, get some booties on them things.
You're crapping up the floor.

165
00:17:39,621 --> 00:17:41,019
Check his visa.

166
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:45,353
The Cephalopods have been making
counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.

167
00:17:45,527 --> 00:17:50,794
And why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph
going through passport control?

168
00:17:50,966 --> 00:17:55,130
That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry.
Please don't neuralyze me, sir.

169
00:17:55,303 --> 00:17:58,829
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing, sir.

170
00:18:02,344 --> 00:18:03,902
Good work in the subway.

171
00:18:04,078 --> 00:18:07,980
- I remember Jeff when he was yea high.
- What you got for me?

172
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,448
Look. See those guys in black suits?

173
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:13,679
- They work here. We got it covered.
- Zed, what you got?

174
00:18:13,854 --> 00:18:18,086
Dedication's one thing, but this job
will eat you up and spit you out.

175
00:18:18,259 --> 00:18:21,229
You want to look like me
when you hit 50...

176
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:23,555
... ish?

177
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:26,662
I'll be in the gym if you need me.

178
00:18:27,302 --> 00:18:30,669
All right, there was a killing earlier.
177 Spring.

179
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:32,135
Alien-on-alien.

180
00:18:32,306 --> 00:18:34,832
Take Tee with you
and make a report.

181
00:18:36,678 --> 00:18:36,710
Tee. Right.

182
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,716
Tee. Right.

183
00:18:43,751 --> 00:18:46,777
You have got to stop neuralyzing
MiB personnel.

184
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:49,184
He was crying
in the middle of the diner.

185
00:18:49,356 --> 00:18:50,881
I hate that.

186
00:18:51,492 --> 00:18:53,688
And plus, you can't count Elle.

187
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:56,796
She wanted to go back to the morgue.
I helped her.

188
00:18:56,965 --> 00:18:59,865
- You need a partner.
- I'm cool.

189
00:19:00,168 --> 00:19:02,159
I'll be his partner.

190
00:19:03,037 --> 00:19:06,029
Jay, wait up.
I appreciate the shot, man.

191
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:08,402
- Thought I'd never get out.
- Lose the suit.

192
00:19:08,576 --> 00:19:10,771
Sure thing.
Just going for the look.

193
00:19:10,946 --> 00:19:13,642
But if I say so myself,
I find it slimming.

194
00:19:13,815 --> 00:19:16,442
Not that I've had problems
with the ladies.

195
00:19:16,617 --> 00:19:18,210
When you get down to--

196
00:19:18,385 --> 00:19:20,114
Nice sled, very swank.

197
00:19:20,287 --> 00:19:22,414
Heated seats? Sometimes I get hives.

198
00:19:43,879 --> 00:19:45,210
Frank!

199
00:19:46,148 --> 00:19:49,709
Bring your head in this window
before I roll it up in there.

200
00:19:49,884 --> 00:19:51,249
Got it.

201
00:19:57,258 --> 00:19:58,691
Frank!

202
00:19:59,995 --> 00:20:01,929
My money? It's missionary.

203
00:20:02,096 --> 00:20:05,156
I was in the Bowery,
and I meet this Great Dane.

204
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:07,596
A little thick in the body,
but pretty.

205
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:10,863
That's just not appealing to me, man.
Seriously.

206
00:20:11,038 --> 00:20:13,336
I say we do the good cop,
bad cop thing.

207
00:20:13,508 --> 00:20:16,067
You interrogate the witness
and I growl.

208
00:20:16,244 --> 00:20:20,476
How about we do the good cop,
dumb dog thing, and you just shut up?

209
00:20:20,649 --> 00:20:23,015
You got it, partner.
Total silence.

210
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:26,517
Absolute quiet. Not a word out of me.

211
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:28,846
What do we got?

212
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:34,460
- What do we got?
- There's residue on the wall.

213
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:39,531
- We sent samples to Em for analysis.
- Hey,0% body fat.

214
00:20:42,304 --> 00:20:43,965
- Funny.
- Witness?

215
00:20:44,873 --> 00:20:46,465
Girl. Saw everything.

216
00:20:47,842 --> 00:20:49,207
She's taking it well.

217
00:20:49,376 --> 00:20:53,540
I won't answer any more questions.
I want to know what happened here.

218
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:56,008
- I'll handle this one.
- You got it.

219
00:20:56,183 --> 00:20:59,550
Alone. A talking dog might be
a bit much for her now.

220
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,779
What do you want me to do?

221
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:04,149
Sniff around.

222
00:21:04,726 --> 00:21:06,249
What?

223
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,886
Funny.

224
00:21:08,063 --> 00:21:10,530
Take a deep breath.
Everything is all right.

225
00:21:10,699 --> 00:21:13,826
What part is she supposed
to feel all right about?

226
00:21:17,072 --> 00:21:18,595
I'm Agent Jay.

227
00:21:18,773 --> 00:21:20,263
Tell me what you saw.

228
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:22,967
- A two-headed guy and a woman.
- Caucasian?

229
00:21:23,143 --> 00:21:26,135
Gray, with tentacles
that she used to rip--

230
00:21:26,314 --> 00:21:27,372
His skin off.

231
00:21:27,548 --> 00:21:32,851
It's not skin. It's protoplasma polymer
similar to the gum in baseball cards.

232
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,581
- What was the last thing you ate?
- Calzone.

233
00:21:35,757 --> 00:21:36,883
- What time?
- Lunch.

234
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:39,423
- Spinach?
- Mushroom.

235
00:21:40,295 --> 00:21:41,853
You need pie.

236
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:41,962
They kept asking Ben about a light.

237
00:21:41,962 --> 00:21:46,968
They kept asking Ben about a light.

238
00:21:47,902 --> 00:21:49,425
You okay?

239
00:21:49,604 --> 00:21:52,902
An hour ago, a man I've known
my whole life vanished...

240
00:21:53,074 --> 00:21:55,668
... because of a woman
with weird fingers...

241
00:21:55,844 --> 00:21:58,539
... and a two-headed guy
with a cannoli's IQ.

242
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:01,374
So yeah, everything's okay.

243
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:06,681
When we're kids,
before we're taught how to think...

244
00:22:06,854 --> 00:22:10,188
... our hearts tell us there is
something else out there.

245
00:22:10,357 --> 00:22:15,260
I know what I saw.
Tell me what I'm supposed to believe.

246
00:22:20,902 --> 00:22:26,033
I'm a member of a secret organization
that monitors alien activity on Earth.

247
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:28,402
Ben was an alien.
So were his killers.

248
00:22:28,575 --> 00:22:32,568
I don't know why they did it,
but I promise I'm gonna find out.

249
00:22:33,847 --> 00:22:35,815
Okay.

250
00:22:36,217 --> 00:22:38,741
- Okay?
- Okay.

251
00:22:40,154 --> 00:22:41,587
Okay.

252
00:22:46,894 --> 00:22:49,659
- I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to--
- Kill me.

253
00:22:49,831 --> 00:22:51,354
No!

254
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:55,469
Just a little flash and everything
goes back the way it was.

255
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:59,237
After you flash me...

256
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:01,841
... if I see you again,
will I know it's you?

257
00:23:02,009 --> 00:23:04,035
I'll see you.

258
00:23:06,715 --> 00:23:08,443
But you won't see me.

259
00:23:08,615 --> 00:23:10,674
Must be hard.

260
00:23:10,852 --> 00:23:12,751
Must be very lonely.

261
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:29,525
Excuse me.

262
00:23:30,872 --> 00:23:33,863
- I gotta go.
- What about the flashy thing?

263
00:23:35,043 --> 00:23:37,671
I'll flash you some other time.

264
00:23:55,462 --> 00:23:57,090
What?

265
00:24:01,736 --> 00:24:07,140
- Did you tell the girl you love her?
- She's a witness to a crime. That's it.

266
00:24:07,776 --> 00:24:11,404
You're attracted. She's not my species,
and I'm attracted.

267
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:15,537
I should take advice on love
from a dude that chases his own ass?

268
00:24:15,717 --> 00:24:19,744
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling,
and I resent it.

269
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,802
Hey, Jay, wait up.

270
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:40,998
Coming through. MiB brass.
Look sharp.

271
00:24:41,175 --> 00:24:45,112
I'm Agent Eff, Jay's new partner.
Who are you eyeballing?

272
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,544
Frank, just cool out, dog.

273
00:24:49,316 --> 00:24:50,874
- Got kids?
- No.

274
00:24:51,052 --> 00:24:52,518
Want them?

275
00:24:55,722 --> 00:24:57,690
Get him off me!

276
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:08,729
- Talk to me.
- lt's Kylothian, class C.

277
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:09,892
Serleena.

278
00:25:10,071 --> 00:25:12,402
- Serleena. Old girlfriend?
- She wishes.

279
00:25:12,574 --> 00:25:15,269
The perps were looking
for the Light of--

280
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:17,104
- Zartha.
- Yeah, what is it?

281
00:25:17,277 --> 00:25:19,746
This makes no sense.
It's not on Earth.

282
00:25:19,913 --> 00:25:23,179
- We took care of this a long time ago.
- Obviously not.

283
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:25,375
That is very bad news.

284
00:25:25,553 --> 00:25:29,249
The Zarthans came to Earth
to hide the Light from Serleena.

285
00:25:29,423 --> 00:25:32,915
- We don't do that.
- Right. I ordered it off the planet.

286
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:34,720
Well, Zed... .

287
00:25:34,895 --> 00:25:39,333
I got a Kylothian class C in my park.
Are you sure this Light isn't here?

288
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:43,095
Positive. I gave the order.
My best agent carried it out.

289
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:45,831
- lt's as if I gave it to you.
- Ask the agent.

290
00:25:46,007 --> 00:25:47,098
- Can't.
- Dead?

291
00:25:47,275 --> 00:25:50,438
Sort of. He works at the post office.

292
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:52,738
No.

293
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:55,575
If Serleena gets to Kay before we do,
he's dead.

294
00:25:55,749 --> 00:25:58,776
The Earth's very existence
may rest on what Kay knows.

295
00:25:58,952 --> 00:26:01,421
Too bad you wiped out
his memory of it.

296
00:26:01,588 --> 00:26:03,078
Bring him in.

297
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,447
Now.

298
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:08,687
How cool is this? Going to get Kay.
The legend, the go-to guy.

299
00:26:08,863 --> 00:26:11,388
The guy who taught you everything.

300
00:26:11,565 --> 00:26:16,196
- The greatest agent in MiB history!
- Frank! Stop talking.

301
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,305
Stay.

302
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:24,069
Listen, partner.
I may look like a dog...

303
00:26:24,245 --> 00:26:26,712
... but I only play one here on Earth.

304
00:26:27,081 --> 00:26:29,548
- Whatever. Wipe your mouth.
- Hey, babe.

305
00:26:35,923 --> 00:26:39,222
People of Truro,
may I kindly have your attention?

306
00:26:39,393 --> 00:26:41,827
To facilitate your shipping needs...

307
00:26:41,996 --> 00:26:44,658
... all packages must be
properly wrapped.

308
00:26:44,832 --> 00:26:48,700
This one is an example of
"go home and do it again. "

309
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:51,668
I think you know what I mean,
Mrs. Vigushin.

310
00:26:51,838 --> 00:26:56,708
Brown paper and triple-twist twine
are the preferred media.

311
00:26:56,877 --> 00:26:58,606
Thank you for your time.

312
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:02,710
- Kay.
- C. Express mail, two-day air.

313
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:05,777
Kevin.

314
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:10,684
Kevin. That's funny.
You don't have a "Kevin"... .

315
00:27:13,428 --> 00:27:15,658
You don't remember.
We worked together.

316
00:27:15,829 --> 00:27:19,925
I never worked in a funeral home.
Something I can do for you, slick?

317
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:21,728
Straight to the point.

318
00:27:22,469 --> 00:27:26,701
You were an agent of an organization
that monitors aliens on Earth.

319
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:30,934
We're the Men in Black.
We have a situation. We need your help.

320
00:27:31,112 --> 00:27:34,843
There is a free mental health clinic
on the corner of Lilac.

321
00:27:35,016 --> 00:27:36,983
- Next.
- Excuse me.

322
00:27:37,517 --> 00:27:39,543
- Twenty Rugrats stamps.
- Elizabeth.

323
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,020
The Postal Service hasn't kept up
with today's youth, but we have...

324
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:46,854
... Berlin airlift stamps.
Opera legends?

325
00:27:47,027 --> 00:27:49,997
American Samoa?
Amish quilts.

326
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:52,893
I'm sorry, got a world to save here.

327
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:56,293
There was no coma.
It was a cover.

328
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,267
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

329
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:02,738
The postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts,
and I'm ordering you to leave.

330
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,113
- ls that decaf?
- Sorry.

331
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,646
We have a breach.
Cordon off this area.

332
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,808
Full perimeter wipe-down,
right here, right now.

333
00:28:12,987 --> 00:28:17,390
Get a mop and escort all civilian
personnel from this site immediately.

334
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:20,720
Listen to yourself, Kay.
Who talks like that?

335
00:29:16,718 --> 00:29:19,585
Why do you think you're
so comfortable here?

336
00:29:21,154 --> 00:29:24,988
Just about everybody who works
in a post office is an alien.

337
00:29:32,667 --> 00:29:34,691
No smoking.

338
00:29:43,611 --> 00:29:44,737
Kay.

339
00:29:45,046 --> 00:29:48,674
My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy
fly a tiger around a room.

340
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,340
You're nothing special.

341
00:29:50,517 --> 00:29:53,419
When you look at the stars,
you get a feeling...

342
00:29:53,587 --> 00:29:55,578
... like you don't know who you are.

343
00:29:55,757 --> 00:29:59,385
Like you know more about out there
than you do down here.

344
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:04,155
That's why she left you, Kay.
That's why your wife left you.

345
00:30:06,167 --> 00:30:07,998
Okay, I'll tell you what.

346
00:30:08,169 --> 00:30:12,071
You want to know who you really are,
take a ride with me.

347
00:30:12,239 --> 00:30:16,107
If not, people are waiting
for their TV Guides.

348
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,769
Think he'll bite?

349
00:30:26,687 --> 00:30:30,418
I'm just going for a ride. If things
don't add up, it's hasta luego.

350
00:30:30,591 --> 00:30:32,149
Hey, Kay.

351
00:30:33,494 --> 00:30:35,758
How's it hanging?

352
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:51,908
Good to see you, Kay.

353
00:30:52,078 --> 00:30:55,139
Good to see you too,
whoever you are.

354
00:30:56,517 --> 00:31:00,715
Well, let's see
what you got here, chief.

355
00:31:11,164 --> 00:31:13,462
Welcome back, Agent Kay.

356
00:31:14,701 --> 00:31:15,998
Agent Kay.

357
00:31:16,604 --> 00:31:18,730
Greetings, Kay.

358
00:31:20,874 --> 00:31:22,206
Wow, look who's back.

359
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:24,936
I don't mean to bother you--
You're Agent Kay!

360
00:31:25,112 --> 00:31:28,275
- That's what they tell me.
- This is an honor. Agent Gee.

361
00:31:28,449 --> 00:31:30,917
The most respected agent
in MiB history.

362
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:33,575
The most feared human in the universe.

363
00:31:33,754 --> 00:31:36,722
Maybe I could buy you a cup of coffee?

364
00:31:36,891 --> 00:31:39,553
- Black, two sugars, if you're going.
- An honor.

365
00:31:39,727 --> 00:31:43,094
- Yeah, I'll take a-- My man?
- Good to see you, Kay.

366
00:31:44,765 --> 00:31:46,163
How'd it go?

367
00:31:46,334 --> 00:31:48,802
The Drolacks are gone
and the treaty is signed.

368
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:49,959
Good work.

369
00:31:50,136 --> 00:31:53,469
What about that position you
promised me in Men in Black?

370
00:31:53,641 --> 00:31:57,076
Still working on the alien
affirmative action program.

371
00:31:57,245 --> 00:31:59,508
That's not what you promised me.

372
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:01,773
- You're breaking up.
- Zed? Hello?

373
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:05,544
- I'll call you back.
- I could be Agent Em. Zed, you--

374
00:32:06,286 --> 00:32:11,054
I think Earth might be in a bad way.
You're the only one that could save it.

375
00:32:11,225 --> 00:32:14,318
- Well, neither rain, sleet, snow... .
- Good man.

376
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:18,396
Get him armed and up to speed
and over to deneuralyzation.

377
00:32:19,566 --> 00:32:20,692
- Frank?
- Yeah?

378
00:32:20,902 --> 00:32:23,836
I'm gonna need them together
on this one.

379
00:32:24,337 --> 00:32:27,967
I need an assistant. It's not
field work, but you get dental.

380
00:32:28,142 --> 00:32:29,632
Dental?

381
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:34,114
The most advanced technologies from
all over the universe are in this room.

382
00:32:34,114 --> 00:32:36,584
The most advanced technologies from
all over the universe are in this room.

383
00:32:36,584 --> 00:32:38,085
What's this?

384
00:32:39,353 --> 00:32:42,219
All is lost! All is lost!

385
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,848
Don't touch that!

386
00:32:45,793 --> 00:32:47,692
I didn't do anything.

387
00:32:47,862 --> 00:32:51,025
Hands in your pockets.

388
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,602
Your favorite weapon.

389
00:33:05,379 --> 00:33:07,642
- That?
- Yep.

390
00:33:08,149 --> 00:33:10,241
- Let's go put it on.
- What?

391
00:33:10,418 --> 00:33:12,749
The last suit you'll ever wear.

392
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,478
Again.

393
00:33:21,594 --> 00:33:22,925
The deneuralyzer.

394
00:33:24,498 --> 00:33:27,557
Magneto-energy will surge
through your brain...

395
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:32,331
... unlocking information that could
hold the key to Earth's very survival.

396
00:33:32,506 --> 00:33:35,168
Okay. What's that thing?

397
00:33:36,544 --> 00:33:38,568
The deneuralyzer.

398
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:50,046
Welcome to planet Earth.
There are some rules and regulations.

399
00:33:50,223 --> 00:33:51,623
Go out only at night.

400
00:33:51,792 --> 00:33:56,024
If you must go out during the daylight,
only the East Village.

401
00:34:00,468 --> 00:34:01,991
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

402
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,141
Name and planet of origin?

403
00:34:09,309 --> 00:34:13,041
Sylona Gorth. Planet Jorn.
Kaluth system.

404
00:34:14,048 --> 00:34:18,074
- Any fruits or vegetables?
- Yeah, two heads of cabbage.

405
00:34:18,251 --> 00:34:19,240
Reason for visit?

406
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:22,947
Education. I want to learn
how to be an underwear model.

407
00:34:23,124 --> 00:34:25,853
They told me I've got real potential.

408
00:34:28,396 --> 00:34:30,193
Help! Heart attack!

409
00:34:31,432 --> 00:34:32,865
Clear!

410
00:34:34,135 --> 00:34:36,126
Wake up, champ!

411
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:44,833
- Oh, jeez.
- Lockdown. Code 101.

412
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,713
Lockdown.

413
00:34:48,615 --> 00:34:51,244
This is not good. This is not good.

414
00:34:57,925 --> 00:35:00,916
- Breach! We're being flushed.
- Flushed?

415
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:04,623
- Ever been to a water park?
- I don't know.

416
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:39,796
Flushed.

417
00:35:41,267 --> 00:35:45,398
Yeah, man, back when you was an agent,
you loved getting flushed.

418
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:50,168
Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd
be like, "Flush me, Jay. Flush me. "

419
00:35:50,344 --> 00:35:52,072
I'd be like, "No. "

420
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:55,204
You can't quit on me.

421
00:35:55,382 --> 00:35:58,282
I save the world, you tell me
why I stare at the stars.

422
00:35:58,452 --> 00:36:00,010
Cool.

423
00:36:02,289 --> 00:36:04,291
- Hop in.
- Hop in what?

424
00:36:10,164 --> 00:36:11,688
Does that come standard?

425
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:15,996
It came with a black dude,
but he kept getting pulled over.

426
00:36:18,505 --> 00:36:23,409
I could rule this place
with the right set of mammary glands.

427
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:25,335
Trapped like rats...

428
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,137
... in a Chia Pet.

429
00:36:27,313 --> 00:36:29,907
Computer, surveillance MiB.

430
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:36,519
MiB's locked down.

431
00:36:38,626 --> 00:36:42,220
Computer, magnify. Times 10.

432
00:36:43,363 --> 00:36:45,264
Communicator. Frank.

433
00:36:45,532 --> 00:36:47,865
- Jay, where are you?
- We got flushed.

434
00:36:48,034 --> 00:36:50,195
- MiB's code 101.
- Yeah, who did it?

435
00:36:50,371 --> 00:36:53,340
Some hot-looking biker chick.
Want me to tail her?

436
00:36:53,507 --> 00:36:58,376
- Stay where you are. I'll be in touch.
- Stay where I am. Easy for you to say.

437
00:36:58,545 --> 00:36:59,945
- Find Kay?
- Neuralyzed.

438
00:37:00,113 --> 00:37:02,742
- Not active. Civilian.
- What?

439
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:03,941
- He was--
- Here.

440
00:37:04,117 --> 00:37:05,449
- To get--
- Deneuralyzed.

441
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:10,146
- Memory's shot. But we'll find him.
- Don't put anything in our ears.

442
00:37:11,124 --> 00:37:12,113
What?

443
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:15,751
What do you make of that?
Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh?

444
00:37:15,929 --> 00:37:18,659
- Yeah, a smile.
- ls that the only deneuralyzer?

445
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:21,766
Officially. The plans leaked out
on the Internet.

446
00:37:21,936 --> 00:37:23,927
Computer, Internet.

447
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:25,934
Deneuralyzer.

448
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:31,978
Perfect. It's an old friend.

449
00:37:39,753 --> 00:37:41,778
Jay, ain't seen you in a while.

450
00:37:41,956 --> 00:37:44,686
Did you peep that drop-top thing
out front?

451
00:37:44,858 --> 00:37:46,985
My business is banging, dog.

452
00:37:47,494 --> 00:37:50,860
You gotta check out the website.
It's Jeebsie dot--

453
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:53,123
Okay, whoa. He's retired, right?

454
00:37:53,566 --> 00:37:55,329
We need the deneuralyzer.

455
00:37:55,501 --> 00:37:58,835
- You're kidding.
- The meter's running, Jeebs.

456
00:38:01,242 --> 00:38:03,472
Do you remember me?

457
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,103
Can't say I do.
I'm good with faces.

458
00:38:06,713 --> 00:38:08,409
I think I'd remember that.

459
00:38:09,617 --> 00:38:11,675
The great Kay's a neutral.

460
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:16,152
You're between me and my memories.
Do you have this deneuralyzer or not?

461
00:38:16,322 --> 00:38:17,653
No.

462
00:38:18,791 --> 00:38:20,282
Fresh out.

463
00:38:21,528 --> 00:38:23,188
Can't help you.

464
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:26,789
Don't got it.

465
00:38:35,476 --> 00:38:39,378
Even if I did, if it doesn't work,
he dies, you blow my head off.

466
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:43,572
If it does, I've brought back Kay,
who, for fun, blows my head off.

467
00:38:43,751 --> 00:38:45,650
So, what's my incentive?

468
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:50,150
Okay, homey, I keep it downstairs
next to the snow blowers.

469
00:38:53,661 --> 00:38:56,891
Alien prisoners released,
armed and ready for your orders.

470
00:38:57,063 --> 00:39:00,499
Prisoners of MiB,
the scum of the universe.

471
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:02,525
Now it's the scum's turn.

472
00:39:02,702 --> 00:39:05,137
I'm in a jam,
so I'll make this simple.

473
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:09,007
I need the Light of Zartha,
and Kay knows where it is.

474
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:11,507
Whoever brings Kay to me gets Earth.

475
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:14,978
Find a deneuralyzer.
They want his memory back.

476
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:16,979
Check.

477
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:19,175
Now.

478
00:39:22,588 --> 00:39:24,557
Jarra, good to see you.

479
00:39:28,528 --> 00:39:30,429
Okay, that should do it.

480
00:39:30,597 --> 00:39:34,965
If I could have your attention
while we go over the safety procedures.

481
00:39:35,135 --> 00:39:37,659
Keep your hands inside the vehicle.

482
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:40,932
lf, during the ride,
you become disoriented...

483
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:43,769
... there's nothing we can do about it.

484
00:39:45,244 --> 00:39:47,679
Have you removed all your jewelry?

485
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:51,682
- Are you allergic to shellfish?
- Jeebs!

486
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,650
Right, then!
Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

487
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:02,628
Have you used this?

488
00:40:02,829 --> 00:40:06,595
I used it to make some hot-air popcorn.
That's about it.

489
00:40:06,766 --> 00:40:09,702
Okay! Let's make it happen, cap'n!

490
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:06,324
Perfect.

491
00:41:20,007 --> 00:41:22,066
- You're back.
- No.

492
00:41:22,242 --> 00:41:25,438
- How'd you know his head grows back?
- lt grows back?

493
00:41:27,947 --> 00:41:31,849
Real nice. Okay, that's the last time
I help out a friend.

494
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,811
- Kay, you remember anything?
- Goodbye.

495
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:38,548
- Kay!
- Kay, wait!

496
00:41:39,392 --> 00:41:42,920
I never got the updated software.
Still working off the 6.0.

497
00:41:43,095 --> 00:41:45,030
Your brain needs to reboot.

498
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:47,597
Give it a minute.

499
00:41:47,767 --> 00:41:49,166
Kay!

500
00:41:49,436 --> 00:41:52,706
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.

501
00:41:52,706 --> 00:41:54,697
Bottom of my heart, I'm really sorry.
I hope it won't affect our friendship.

502
00:41:54,874 --> 00:41:59,403
All those years of loyalty and trust,
respect for one another.

503
00:42:01,849 --> 00:42:03,146
Right over there!

504
00:42:04,684 --> 00:42:07,153
- Where's Kay?
- He's not here! He went--

505
00:42:07,353 --> 00:42:10,686
Kay's retired. I'm his
trigger-happy replacement.

506
00:42:10,858 --> 00:42:14,418
Right in the pie hole.
Now nothing's gonna taste right.

507
00:42:14,595 --> 00:42:17,063
- Lower your weapon.
- No.

508
00:42:22,568 --> 00:42:25,094
Jay, how are you, boo-boo?

509
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:27,934
- These guys really need Kay.
- He's a neutral.

510
00:42:28,108 --> 00:42:31,771
- Tell me something we don't know.
- Yeah, tell me something--

511
00:42:31,945 --> 00:42:33,537
I am so sorry.

512
00:42:33,713 --> 00:42:35,704
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

513
00:42:36,983 --> 00:42:41,010
If I don't bring Kay back to MiB,
Serleena's gonna kick my ass.

514
00:42:41,188 --> 00:42:43,246
- Now, where is he?
- Where is who?

515
00:42:43,423 --> 00:42:45,983
You don't look too good.

516
00:42:46,726 --> 00:42:48,592
Yeah, and you look like crap.

517
00:42:51,398 --> 00:42:54,264
I take that back. He look like crap.

518
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:58,769
- Bend him!
- Bend him.

519
00:42:58,938 --> 00:43:00,804
Wait, don't bend him.

520
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:40,376
Damn decent of you.

521
00:43:40,947 --> 00:43:42,244
Don't mention it.

522
00:44:03,103 --> 00:44:05,900
- I'm gonna be sick.
- You don't wanna do that.

523
00:44:06,072 --> 00:44:10,099
- Fellas, I think he's telling the truth.
- Then he's no good to us.

524
00:44:12,445 --> 00:44:15,438
- Didn't I teach you anything, kid?
- Pineal eye!

525
00:44:18,017 --> 00:44:19,713
Go for the mosh tendrils!

526
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:25,791
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.

527
00:44:30,197 --> 00:44:32,722
- You were in a tight spot.
- I handled it.

528
00:44:32,898 --> 00:44:35,697
- You need a partner.
- I had one. Job got too tough.

529
00:44:35,869 --> 00:44:38,200
I'm back. You got some dust
on your coat.

530
00:44:38,371 --> 00:44:40,237
So you got your memory back.

531
00:44:40,407 --> 00:44:42,874
- What the hell is going on?
- Don't know.

532
00:44:43,043 --> 00:44:45,510
- The Light of Zartha?
- Never heard of it.

533
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:46,702
Cool.

534
00:44:50,050 --> 00:44:52,382
You don't remember
the Light of Zartha?

535
00:44:52,552 --> 00:44:55,248
Must've neuralyzed myself
to keep it from myself.

536
00:44:55,421 --> 00:44:58,686
- Good plan. What you doing?
- I do the driving.

537
00:44:58,858 --> 00:45:00,849
- Wait, no. Whoa.
- I remember that.

538
00:45:01,028 --> 00:45:04,963
What you remember is you used
to drive that old, busted jawn.

539
00:45:05,132 --> 00:45:08,191
I drive the new hotness.

540
00:45:08,367 --> 00:45:11,996
Old and busted, new hotness.

541
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:23,039
Old busted hotness.

542
00:45:23,416 --> 00:45:26,112
- Serleena, please.
- Been a long time, Zed.

543
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:29,914
I'm just touched you remembered me.
Makes me fuzzy all over.

544
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:33,423
Never forget a pretty
whatever you are.

545
00:45:35,662 --> 00:45:37,356
Zed?

546
00:45:37,731 --> 00:45:39,391
Zed? Look at you.

547
00:45:39,566 --> 00:45:42,557
Twenty-five years,
and you're still such a looker.

548
00:45:42,735 --> 00:45:44,465
Cut out the meat and dairy.

549
00:45:44,637 --> 00:45:48,438
And you, still a pile of squirmy
crap in a different wrapper.

550
00:45:48,775 --> 00:45:52,438
So feisty.
Look, we both need the same thing.

551
00:45:55,347 --> 00:45:56,871
Bring him in.

552
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,642
Don't think so.

553
00:45:58,818 --> 00:46:02,778
What about the Light's secret?
If it's not off Earth by midnight...

554
00:46:02,956 --> 00:46:06,391
... it self-destructs,
annihilating your little planet.

555
00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:10,427
I lose, you lose.
I win, everything keeps spinning.

556
00:46:10,831 --> 00:46:14,789
You don't want the Light on Earth
any more than I do.

557
00:46:17,403 --> 00:46:19,099
All right, Serleena.

558
00:46:20,373 --> 00:46:22,237
You win.

559
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:27,177
Zed? Is that you?
I could be Agent Em.

560
00:46:27,546 --> 00:46:28,979
Zed. Hello?

561
00:46:39,492 --> 00:46:41,552
So feisty.

562
00:46:46,032 --> 00:46:49,695
Fastest way back to MiB,
you take this right on 39th.

563
00:46:49,869 --> 00:46:51,427
Right here. Right.

564
00:46:53,606 --> 00:46:55,369
Next right on 37th.

565
00:46:55,541 --> 00:46:58,010
Right here. Right!

566
00:46:58,345 --> 00:46:59,903
We're not going back.

567
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:05,142
Headquarters has been breached, man.
We need to peel caps and split wigs.

568
00:47:05,318 --> 00:47:06,945
Not ready.

569
00:47:07,387 --> 00:47:10,845
Look, you've been out for five years.
That's a long time.

570
00:47:11,023 --> 00:47:14,117
I understand you're scared.
I'm a little scared too.

571
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:16,353
- I'm not scared.
- Me neither.

572
00:47:16,929 --> 00:47:19,329
I just thought we was bonding.

573
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:24,262
You're acting like a rookie.
Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.

574
00:47:24,436 --> 00:47:28,532
- No wonder Zed brought me back.
- He did it because you messed up.

575
00:47:28,708 --> 00:47:31,403
Your attitude makes for
a stressful environment.

576
00:47:31,577 --> 00:47:35,639
Tell it to the hand.
Stressful is what we got back at MiB.

577
00:47:35,816 --> 00:47:40,412
Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB
in order to lure me back.

578
00:47:40,586 --> 00:47:42,646
Into a trap.

579
00:47:42,822 --> 00:47:45,382
Which is why we can't
bust in there.

580
00:47:45,559 --> 00:47:48,550
We need a plan. Where we going?
Scene of the crime?

581
00:47:48,728 --> 00:47:52,925
- You're the boss.
- Scene of the crime. That's a left.

582
00:47:55,402 --> 00:47:57,869
I'll contact the witness.
We'll talk to her.

583
00:47:58,037 --> 00:48:01,302
Things have changed.
We used to neuralyze witnesses.

584
00:48:02,641 --> 00:48:04,371
See, originally, I'd--

585
00:48:05,378 --> 00:48:09,871
No, I was going to--
I interrogated her.

586
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,083
- Then neuralyzed her?
- What?

587
00:48:11,083 --> 00:48:11,708
- Then neuralyzed her?
- What?

588
00:48:11,885 --> 00:48:17,289
MiB code 773ll-1 clearly states
that all civilian personnel--

589
00:48:18,291 --> 00:48:19,780
- Drop that weapon!
- No!

590
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,552
Jay, I'm-- I'm sorry.

591
00:48:21,728 --> 00:48:24,662
No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault.

592
00:48:24,998 --> 00:48:27,465
Kay, my partner.
Laura, the witness.

593
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:28,760
Pleasure.

594
00:48:30,036 --> 00:48:34,632
Thanks for sending those agents over
to keep an eye on me last night.

595
00:48:34,807 --> 00:48:36,798
MiB procedural code 594-B...

596
00:48:36,976 --> 00:48:40,139
... states that MiB personnel
shall never be used--

597
00:48:40,313 --> 00:48:45,648
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here.
I assume the perp was over here.

598
00:48:45,818 --> 00:48:47,376
Ben.

599
00:48:47,554 --> 00:48:50,387
- Was he 5'7", thinning hair?
- You knew him?

600
00:48:50,824 --> 00:48:53,054
Nope. Never seen him before
in my life.

601
00:48:53,226 --> 00:48:56,126
That is a hell of a fish.

602
00:48:58,331 --> 00:49:00,128
Wait a minute.

603
00:49:05,271 --> 00:49:06,670
You left yourself clues?

604
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:10,900
In case I was deneuralyzed because
my replacement couldn't handle it.

605
00:49:11,077 --> 00:49:15,740
If the joker that had got deneuralyzed
hadn't created the situation--

606
00:49:15,916 --> 00:49:17,246
Boys.

607
00:49:19,152 --> 00:49:22,052
All right. You pointing at something.

608
00:49:26,226 --> 00:49:27,590
Excuse me.

609
00:49:29,128 --> 00:49:30,720
The astronaut.

610
00:49:32,331 --> 00:49:33,492
Jay?

611
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:36,264
Okay, all right. He's pointing... .

612
00:49:36,436 --> 00:49:38,403
He's like... .

613
00:49:41,173 --> 00:49:42,970
Who would stack boxes like this?

614
00:49:43,142 --> 00:49:46,976
A box stacker who's not stacking boxes.
He's leaving clues.

615
00:49:47,146 --> 00:49:48,637
It's an arrow.

616
00:49:52,786 --> 00:49:55,050
- Jay?
- You're slowing me down, slick.

617
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:58,849
Whatever we're looking for
is in these cabinets, right here.

618
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,320
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.

619
00:50:06,865 --> 00:50:09,231
I hope I'm not slowing you down.

620
00:50:09,836 --> 00:50:12,463
Good work, partner. Yeah.

621
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:15,574
- We gotta figure out where it goes.
- I know where.

622
00:50:15,874 --> 00:50:20,005
- No. Not yet.
- MiB code 773 clearly says--

623
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:23,376
I know the code,
but she might be important to me.

624
00:50:23,983 --> 00:50:26,474
To us. Well, for help.
To help us later.

625
00:50:27,153 --> 00:50:29,849
Well, she can't stay here.
They'll be back.

626
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:36,255
- You can stay with friends of mine.
- People like you?

627
00:50:36,563 --> 00:50:37,552
Kind of.

628
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:39,289
Jay!

629
00:50:39,465 --> 00:50:41,956
- Low bridge!
- What's going on, man?

630
00:50:42,135 --> 00:50:45,400
Hey, what's happening, fellas?
MiB is code 101.

631
00:50:46,005 --> 00:50:47,371
- Bad.
- Very bad.

632
00:50:47,539 --> 00:50:51,601
- I need your help. This is Laura.
- Laura!

633
00:50:51,778 --> 00:50:53,438
Easy, easy!

634
00:50:53,612 --> 00:50:54,601
They're worms.

635
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:58,079
Once you go worm,
that's what you'll yearn.

636
00:50:58,251 --> 00:51:01,583
- That's what they say. They just:
- I've dated worse.

637
00:51:02,121 --> 00:51:04,715
They're suspended
for stealing from duty-free.

638
00:51:04,891 --> 00:51:07,688
- We were framed.
- Zed's wormophobic.

639
00:51:07,860 --> 00:51:09,157
- Kay!
- You're back!

640
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:12,059
- They said you were dead.
- We're double-parked.

641
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:14,132
Laura's very important to me.

642
00:51:14,833 --> 00:51:18,429
To us. To the stuff--
Me and you, the stuff we're doing.

643
00:51:19,572 --> 00:51:22,563
- Keep an eye on her.
- I'll keep both on her.

644
00:51:22,742 --> 00:51:23,731
No problem!

645
00:51:25,978 --> 00:51:28,742
- Why don't you sit here?
- Like you got a shot.

646
00:51:28,914 --> 00:51:30,074
Hey, shut up!

647
00:51:33,253 --> 00:51:35,949
My communicator, in case you need it.

648
00:51:39,592 --> 00:51:41,219
- Nice move.
- Okay.

649
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:47,662
- Just watch out for Neeble.
- Which one's Neeble?

650
00:51:50,103 --> 00:51:52,333
- Which one of y'all is Neeble?
- Yo, mama!

651
00:51:52,505 --> 00:51:56,702
Him, right there. It's fine.
Everything's straight. It's safe.

652
00:51:56,876 --> 00:51:58,867
Don't fall asleep.

653
00:52:00,612 --> 00:52:02,273
Twister!

654
00:52:04,284 --> 00:52:08,947
Run over your plan one more time.
I'm struggling with it.

655
00:52:09,121 --> 00:52:13,023
You neuralyzed memory of the Light
but left yourself clues.

656
00:52:13,193 --> 00:52:14,182
Right.

657
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,423
Photo pointing to a key in a pizzeria
which opens a locker at Grand Central.

658
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,659
- ln the locker, we'll find another clue.
- That's the plan.

659
00:52:26,106 --> 00:52:29,700
- I like to keep my enemies confused.
- We're all confused.

660
00:52:31,978 --> 00:52:36,311
- Are you gonna slow me down?
- Your brain's working on old software.

661
00:52:36,483 --> 00:52:38,713
Why don't you go grab us some coffee?

662
00:52:38,885 --> 00:52:42,376
Sure. How do you take it?
Black? Couple cubes of kiss my ass?

663
00:52:42,554 --> 00:52:45,956
I don't know what's in there,
so step back.

664
00:52:46,126 --> 00:52:49,583
Kay, for real, man.
Open the damn locker.

665
00:52:54,166 --> 00:52:56,566
Kay!
He's back! The light giver!

666
00:52:56,735 --> 00:52:59,226
All hail Kay! All hail Kay!

667
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:03,474
Oh, Kay, can you see
By the dawn's early light

668
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:06,510
You are the man who would be king
of the train locker.

669
00:53:06,679 --> 00:53:07,668
Praise Kay!

670
00:53:07,847 --> 00:53:12,648
Oh, good and gentle townsfolk
of Locker C-18...

671
00:53:12,818 --> 00:53:16,380
- ... did I leave anything here?
- Yes. The timekeeper.

672
00:53:16,556 --> 00:53:19,217
Left to illuminate our streets
and hearts.

673
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:23,851
- I've been looking everywhere for this.
- Merciful one! The clock tower!

674
00:53:24,030 --> 00:53:26,760
I got y'all, it's cool.
Check this out.

675
00:53:27,032 --> 00:53:30,161
Titanium case.
Waterproof to over 300 meters.

676
00:53:30,936 --> 00:53:33,496
- That's banging.
- Who are you, stranger?

677
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,532
Jay.

678
00:53:35,974 --> 00:53:38,170
All hail Jay!
All hail Jay!

679
00:53:38,610 --> 00:53:40,635
Oh, Jay, can you see

680
00:53:40,813 --> 00:53:43,873
- Oh, merciful Jay, the keeper of--
- Come on.

681
00:53:44,416 --> 00:53:46,577
- Wait! The commandments!
- The tablet!

682
00:53:46,753 --> 00:53:49,778
The tablet! The tablet!
The tablet! The tablet!

683
00:53:49,956 --> 00:53:53,983
We have lived by its word, and peace
has reigned throughout our world.

684
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:57,561
Pass it on to others! So that they too
may be enlightened!

685
00:53:57,729 --> 00:53:59,391
Be kind! Rewind!

686
00:53:59,566 --> 00:54:01,396
Reconcile your past...

687
00:54:01,833 --> 00:54:04,233
... in order to move into your future!

688
00:54:04,403 --> 00:54:06,769
Two for one every Wednesday.

689
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:10,307
Give twice as much as ye receive
on our most sacred of days.

690
00:54:10,577 --> 00:54:11,635
Every Wednesday.

691
00:54:11,811 --> 00:54:15,610
Large adult entertainment section
in the back.

692
00:54:19,017 --> 00:54:20,575
That's just nasty.

693
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,684
- What's with the video card?
- Don't know.

694
00:54:23,856 --> 00:54:25,345
- The watch?
- A reminder.

695
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:26,923
- Of what?
- Can't remember.

696
00:54:27,092 --> 00:54:28,081
Guess.

697
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,027
I guess we have till midnight.
59 minutes to figure it out.

698
00:54:34,434 --> 00:54:38,563
Look. Here's an idea. Let's stop
chasing butt-backwards clues...

699
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:42,902
... get a couple fission carbonizers
and get our headquarters back.

700
00:54:43,075 --> 00:54:45,237
It's all about to make sense, kid.

701
00:54:45,411 --> 00:54:47,173
Is this card valid?

702
00:54:48,815 --> 00:54:52,648
- This card hasn't been used in years.
- I've been away on business.

703
00:54:52,818 --> 00:54:55,150
- Billions of frequent flier miles.
- Try and use them.

704
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:59,347
I wanted to go to Cambodia. You can
get a lobster dinner for a dollar.

705
00:54:59,726 --> 00:55:05,061
The airlines black out holidays.
It's a conspiracy, I'm sure, I mean--

706
00:55:05,231 --> 00:55:07,927
Can you tell us anything
about the account?

707
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:10,267
You never checked out a tape.

708
00:55:10,436 --> 00:55:13,769
You reserved one once,
but you never picked it up.

709
00:55:14,307 --> 00:55:16,740
- Newton.
- There's a rat in the toilet.

710
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:21,175
It's all stopped up.
You're gonna have to pee in the sin--

711
00:55:24,383 --> 00:55:27,353
- Still think I'm paranoid?
- Yeah.

712
00:55:28,121 --> 00:55:33,581
Gentlemen, my name is Newton.
I run the place. Seen any aliens lately?

713
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,992
- You need professional help.
- He's getting it. It's not working.

714
00:55:38,164 --> 00:55:40,394
Okay, so, new case, huh?

715
00:55:40,566 --> 00:55:42,999
Episode 27, Light of Zartha.

716
00:55:44,537 --> 00:55:45,833
Got it.

717
00:55:46,472 --> 00:55:50,237
Jarra, it's a sin they've kept
a genius like you locked away.

718
00:55:50,409 --> 00:55:54,369
Their agent Jay caught me siphoning
ozone to sell on the black market.

719
00:55:54,546 --> 00:55:56,481
They're touchy about global warming.

720
00:55:56,648 --> 00:56:00,210
I need a spacecraft that can travel
300 times the speed of light.

721
00:56:00,385 --> 00:56:02,353
I'll give you
whatever you want.

722
00:56:02,521 --> 00:56:05,046
- Give me Jay. We'll call it even.
- Groovy.

723
00:56:05,824 --> 00:56:08,293
You've got till midnight.

724
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:16,059
Gatbot, I got a little
something special for you.

725
00:56:20,539 --> 00:56:23,338
Newton? Newton, is that you?

726
00:56:23,508 --> 00:56:25,999
Yes, Mom, I'm up here
with some friends.

727
00:56:26,179 --> 00:56:27,771
I wanna have your baby.

728
00:56:27,947 --> 00:56:30,039
Would you like some mini-pizza?

729
00:56:30,983 --> 00:56:34,077
You guys want some mini-pizzas?
They're good.

730
00:56:34,253 --> 00:56:37,449
They're like mini-bagels,
with pizza stuff on them.

731
00:56:37,623 --> 00:56:40,420
She'll put a little fontina cheese on.

732
00:56:40,592 --> 00:56:44,552
She has palsy, so she ends
up putting a lot of cheese on.

733
00:56:49,202 --> 00:56:51,329
No, thanks, we're cool.

734
00:56:51,503 --> 00:56:52,766
All right.

735
00:56:54,507 --> 00:56:55,871
Over here.

736
00:57:00,545 --> 00:57:01,876
This is it.

737
00:57:02,181 --> 00:57:04,478
Finally some hard evidence.

738
00:57:04,717 --> 00:57:08,414
Gentlemen, before I play the tape,
one question:

739
00:57:09,021 --> 00:57:10,784
What's up with anal probing?

740
00:57:10,956 --> 00:57:14,858
Aliens travel billions of light
years just to check out our--

741
00:57:15,027 --> 00:57:17,291
Boy, move.

742
00:57:17,463 --> 00:57:20,363
Okay. Just a question.

743
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:24,961
Here is one of their stories
that "never happened"...

744
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:29,005
... from one of their files
that doesn't exist.

745
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:35,403
1978. Devastating war of Zartha
had raged on for 50 years.

746
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:37,344
Looks like Spielberg's work.

747
00:57:37,516 --> 00:57:41,418
But the Zarthans had a great treasure,
the Light of Zartha.

748
00:57:41,586 --> 00:57:44,954
A source of power so awesome,
it alone...

749
00:57:45,124 --> 00:57:48,719
... could mean victory and restoration
for the Zarthans...

750
00:57:48,894 --> 00:57:53,331
... or complete annihilation, if it
fell into the hands of the Kylothians.

751
00:57:53,499 --> 00:57:57,595
A group of Zarthans made the journey,
led by the Keeper of the Light...

752
00:57:57,769 --> 00:57:59,237
Lauranna.

753
00:57:59,671 --> 00:58:01,764
... Princess Lauranna.

754
00:58:02,074 --> 00:58:06,635
Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black
to help her hide the Light on Earth.

755
00:58:06,813 --> 00:58:09,179
But they could not intervene.

756
00:58:09,347 --> 00:58:10,575
No.

757
00:58:11,284 --> 00:58:12,409
It was night.

758
00:58:14,619 --> 00:58:16,052
And it was raining.

759
00:58:16,722 --> 00:58:18,121
You've been very wise.

760
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:22,853
Kay, please. If Serleena takes
the Light, it's the end of our world.

761
00:58:23,496 --> 00:58:26,829
If we extend protection for the Light
beyond Earth...

762
00:58:26,999 --> 00:58:30,331
... we put Earth in jeopardy.
We must remain neutral.

763
00:58:30,536 --> 00:58:33,095
- Where is it?
- We're neutral, remember?

764
00:58:33,306 --> 00:58:35,501
If you want it, go get it.

765
00:58:39,744 --> 00:58:41,235
No!

766
00:59:10,376 --> 00:59:12,673
And so never knowing it happened...

767
00:59:12,845 --> 00:59:15,780
... the people of Earth
were once again saved...

768
00:59:15,947 --> 00:59:19,075
... by a secret society of protectors--

769
00:59:20,186 --> 00:59:21,847
I shouldn't have.

770
00:59:22,822 --> 00:59:25,255
You never sent it off the planet.

771
00:59:26,358 --> 00:59:27,791
You hid it here.

772
00:59:29,795 --> 00:59:31,193
The worm guys.

773
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:38,166
Are you one of Newton's
friends from therapy?

774
00:59:38,336 --> 00:59:42,831
- Yes, ma'am, I am. Look here, please.
- Would you like some mini-pizz--?

775
00:59:43,842 --> 00:59:45,470
A neuralyz--

776
00:59:46,512 --> 00:59:50,072
Okay, first, get some contact lenses.

777
00:59:50,249 --> 00:59:52,546
Joints look like they pick up cable.

778
00:59:52,717 --> 00:59:57,313
Second, take her to Cambodia. Get
her lobster. Pay more than a dollar.

779
00:59:57,490 --> 01:00:00,789
Third, the second y'all get back
from Cambodia...

780
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,985
... move your bum ass
out of your mom's house.

781
01:00:04,162 --> 01:00:06,563
- Let's go.
- Boy, you like 40 years old.

782
01:00:06,731 --> 01:00:09,030
- Agent Jay?
- All right, all right.

783
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:13,193
And there ain't no such thing
as aliens or Men in Black.

784
01:00:19,412 --> 01:00:22,608
- You wanna go to Cambodia?
- Yeah.

785
01:00:24,749 --> 01:00:26,148
Hey, Mom?

786
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,845
Communicator, Jay.

787
01:00:29,722 --> 01:00:32,519
- Laura, it's me.
- Jay, we're playing Twister.

788
01:00:32,691 --> 01:00:34,488
What's up, Jay?

789
01:00:34,659 --> 01:00:37,925
- Quit touching my butt!
- I thought it was your face.

790
01:00:38,097 --> 01:00:41,123
They're good at this.
They don't have spines.

791
01:00:41,300 --> 01:00:44,269
They were telling me about Oprah,
from Chicago.

792
01:00:44,436 --> 01:00:47,668
Maybe landed in Chicago.

793
01:00:48,307 --> 01:00:50,831
- Are you wearing a bracelet?
- Yeah.

794
01:00:51,010 --> 01:00:52,068
Is it glowing?

795
01:00:57,182 --> 01:01:00,175
- lt's never done that before.
- We're on our way.

796
01:01:00,353 --> 01:01:01,876
Communicator, Frank.

797
01:01:02,188 --> 01:01:07,717
Deactivate the lockdown. We're headed
to the worm guys. We found the Light.

798
01:01:07,892 --> 01:01:10,623
Got it, Jay. Scrad?

799
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:11,921
Bitch.

800
01:01:12,097 --> 01:01:13,998
Why didn't you say I love you?

801
01:01:14,166 --> 01:01:18,795
- He's a dog. I don't even like him.
- No, the girl. You're sweet on her.

802
01:01:18,970 --> 01:01:22,133
That's why you didn't neuralyze her.
You got emotionally involved.

803
01:01:22,307 --> 01:01:26,802
- Like you did with Lauranna?
- I put the entire planet in danger.

804
01:01:26,978 --> 01:01:30,244
I don't want to see you
making my mistakes.

805
01:01:30,416 --> 01:01:31,974
Whatever, man.

806
01:01:36,354 --> 01:01:37,583
Laura?

807
01:01:44,563 --> 01:01:45,586
Damn!

808
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:51,970
Never stood half a chance.

809
01:01:53,204 --> 01:01:54,296
Oh, boy.

810
01:01:55,407 --> 01:01:57,467
That's gonna leave a scar.

811
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:00,675
- Where's Laura?
- MiB headquarters.

812
01:02:00,845 --> 01:02:03,974
- Some dumb two-headed guy.
- They got the bracelet.

813
01:02:04,150 --> 01:02:06,914
We got 39 minutes.
You guys...

814
01:02:07,086 --> 01:02:09,246
... pull yourselves together.

815
01:02:09,988 --> 01:02:11,046
Damn.

816
01:02:12,458 --> 01:02:14,516
That's feeling better.

817
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:17,423
- Hey, guys, wait up!
- Let me grab my drink!

818
01:02:17,595 --> 01:02:19,621
Serleena has the bracelet.
Why take Laura?

819
01:02:19,798 --> 01:02:20,958
She also wants me.

820
01:02:21,132 --> 01:02:24,432
- What's the book say?
- We're off book. I say split some wigs.

821
01:02:24,603 --> 01:02:26,833
- We need wig-splitting weapons.
- Got them.

822
01:02:32,378 --> 01:02:35,438
Paw Paw's coming to visit me.
Hello, Paw Paw.

823
01:02:35,613 --> 01:02:38,606
Paw Paw and ZuZu love
to see what's going on in the garden.

824
01:02:38,784 --> 01:02:42,353
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

825
01:02:42,353 --> 01:02:43,255
Don't worry, folks. I used to live
here. Came to pick up a few things.

826
01:02:46,758 --> 01:02:47,358
Nice place.

827
01:02:47,358 --> 01:02:48,724
Nice place.

828
01:03:01,206 --> 01:03:02,469
See you.

829
01:03:12,284 --> 01:03:15,081
You did not see a room
full of weapons or four aliens.

830
01:03:15,253 --> 01:03:17,983
You will cherish and love each other
for the rest of your lives.

831
01:03:18,157 --> 01:03:22,115
Which could be the next 28 minutes,
so get to loving and cherishing.

832
01:03:22,293 --> 01:03:24,956
And she can stay up
as late as she want...

833
01:03:25,130 --> 01:03:27,758
... and have cookies
and candy and stuff.

834
01:03:38,644 --> 01:03:40,838
Four minutes to launch.

835
01:03:41,012 --> 01:03:42,947
Four minutes to launch.

836
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:47,675
- Your ship is ready.
- Good. Send it to Kyloth now.

837
01:03:51,056 --> 01:03:52,284
Ready, guys?

838
01:03:52,458 --> 01:03:54,653
Lock and load, baby.

839
01:03:54,827 --> 01:03:56,487
- You ready, kid?
- Kid?

840
01:03:56,662 --> 01:03:59,688
I saved the world
from a Kreelon invasion.

841
01:03:59,865 --> 01:04:04,028
They're the Backstreet Boys of
the universe. They throw snowballs?

842
01:04:04,804 --> 01:04:06,271
Know what you're doing?

843
01:04:06,438 --> 01:04:09,429
I'm about to attack one
of the most feared aliens...

844
01:04:09,608 --> 01:04:12,873
... with four worms and a mailman.
Let's make it hot.

845
01:04:13,045 --> 01:04:14,307
No, no, wait!

846
01:04:20,085 --> 01:04:22,382
A code 101 lockdown!

847
01:04:22,554 --> 01:04:26,581
The building gets pressurized.
Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that.

848
01:04:26,758 --> 01:04:28,784
Yeah, you knew.
Front and center, worms!

849
01:04:28,961 --> 01:04:30,257
You got it.

850
01:04:36,902 --> 01:04:42,396
It's about time you guys got here.
That lady is causing all kinds of hell.

851
01:05:02,728 --> 01:05:05,992
Yummy. Someone I need to eat.

852
01:05:06,197 --> 01:05:10,133
Get to the launch pad. The bracelet
shows the departure point.

853
01:05:10,302 --> 01:05:12,293
- Do not come back for me.
- What?

854
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:15,166
Do not come back for me.

855
01:05:19,411 --> 01:05:23,507
- Worm guys, give me some cover fire.
- Too scared, can't move.

856
01:05:33,191 --> 01:05:34,385
Go!

857
01:05:45,103 --> 01:05:48,039
- Limber.
- Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta.

858
01:05:48,206 --> 01:05:53,702
- Shut off power so they can't take off.
- Can't. Too scared.

859
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:57,273
- That way.
- Away from the bullets.

860
01:05:57,449 --> 01:05:59,075
No problem.

861
01:06:13,731 --> 01:06:15,632
Nice to see you again, Kay.

862
01:06:19,905 --> 01:06:21,929
- Three minutes to launch.
- Jay!

863
01:06:22,106 --> 01:06:24,302
Three minutes to launch.

864
01:06:24,809 --> 01:06:26,277
Hello, Jay. Long time.

865
01:06:26,445 --> 01:06:28,936
Jarra! What's up, man?
You look great.

866
01:06:29,113 --> 01:06:31,742
- What's it been? Five years?
- And 42 days.

867
01:06:31,916 --> 01:06:34,249
You count every one
when you're locked away.

868
01:06:34,286 --> 01:06:38,490
You shouldn't have tried to steal
our ozone. Be there in one minute.

869
01:06:39,791 --> 01:06:42,385
Over our dead titanium bodies!

870
01:06:42,561 --> 01:06:44,028
Two minutes.

871
01:06:50,668 --> 01:06:52,499
Let's play this one by ear.

872
01:06:55,307 --> 01:06:59,539
- I should have vaporized you before.
- You really did love Lauranna.

873
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:01,577
Didn't you, Kay?

874
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,905
You silly little man.

875
01:07:32,144 --> 01:07:34,202
Two minutes to launch.

876
01:07:36,148 --> 01:07:37,581
Just go, I'll be fine!

877
01:07:38,383 --> 01:07:40,874
What you talking about?
I'm winning.

878
01:07:41,052 --> 01:07:45,079
Jarra, you are under arrest
for being that ugly...

879
01:07:45,257 --> 01:07:48,054
... and for making that many copies.
Surrender!

880
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,124
I want him in pieces.

881
01:07:52,798 --> 01:07:55,130
Jarra Jr. is going, going...

882
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,597
... gone!

883
01:08:10,249 --> 01:08:12,842
- Rectum.
- Damn near killed him!

884
01:08:13,017 --> 01:08:14,780
Never get tired of that one.

885
01:08:14,953 --> 01:08:17,581
- Where do we shut off the power?
- Don't know.

886
01:08:23,628 --> 01:08:27,530
- I'm fine. I'll be there in a minute.
- No, he won't.

887
01:08:33,639 --> 01:08:35,868
Down to one now, Jarra!

888
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,716
Thirty seconds to launch.

889
01:08:55,828 --> 01:08:58,194
Fifteen seconds to launch.

890
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:03,226
Ten seconds to launch.

891
01:09:03,534 --> 01:09:04,762
Eight.

892
01:09:04,936 --> 01:09:06,267
Seven.

893
01:09:06,438 --> 01:09:07,802
Six.

894
01:09:07,972 --> 01:09:09,304
Five.

895
01:09:09,475 --> 01:09:10,600
Four.

896
01:09:10,775 --> 01:09:11,902
Three.

897
01:09:12,077 --> 01:09:13,168
Two.

898
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,614
Launch terminated.

899
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:20,539
- What did you mean, leave you?
- Well, he took your gun.

900
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:23,551
Cracked your head.
Slammed you across the room.

901
01:09:23,721 --> 01:09:27,783
- Half the time you were on your back.
- Look, that's how I fight.

902
01:09:28,493 --> 01:09:30,962
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

903
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:34,189
You've wasted 25 years
of my time, and for what?

904
01:09:34,432 --> 01:09:38,460
The total annihilation of Zartha.
All because you went mushy.

905
01:09:38,636 --> 01:09:42,868
I'll give you one last chance
to surrender, you slimy invertebrate.

906
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:46,601
- What are you gonna do to stop me?
- Not me. Him.

907
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:50,944
Your flight's been canceled.

908
01:09:57,655 --> 01:10:02,092
Shut down power. Shut down power.
Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing... .

909
01:10:02,261 --> 01:10:03,386
Yeah.

910
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:07,728
- Worms!
- Sorry.

911
01:10:12,804 --> 01:10:15,466
- Give me the bracelet.
- I'm going with you.

912
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,337
Everybody in the car.
Everybody.

913
01:10:31,523 --> 01:10:34,390
This bracelet is what
everybody's been after?

914
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:36,288
It's often something small.

915
01:10:36,461 --> 01:10:40,123
It's not the Light.
It tells us the departure point.

916
01:10:40,298 --> 01:10:42,493
If we don't get there in 11 minutes...

917
01:10:42,667 --> 01:10:45,728
... that bracelet will go nuclear
and destroy Earth.

918
01:10:45,904 --> 01:10:47,371
What?!

919
01:10:48,006 --> 01:10:48,994
Hello.

920
01:10:50,007 --> 01:10:51,565
- Wait.
- I know what I'm doing.

921
01:11:07,024 --> 01:11:08,014
Damn.

922
01:11:09,728 --> 01:11:12,925
- Modified to hyper-speed!
- Seat belts.

923
01:11:16,335 --> 01:11:17,359
What's that?

924
01:11:17,536 --> 01:11:20,936
At hyper-speed, you have
to use the navigational stalk.

925
01:11:25,210 --> 01:11:30,273
Toggle switches for the ailerons.
Joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.

926
01:11:34,685 --> 01:11:36,516
I just want you to know--

927
01:11:36,688 --> 01:11:38,814
Hold on to that for one second.

928
01:11:42,394 --> 01:11:44,055
Computer, worms.

929
01:11:44,229 --> 01:11:49,222
I said, "Bitch, if you don't want me
to kick your skinny Zone Diet ass...

930
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:53,269
- ... turn around and exit the planet. "
- Frank, where are you?

931
01:11:53,438 --> 01:11:54,904
Main hall, egg display.

932
01:11:55,073 --> 01:11:57,939
We're taking fire.
Kay pushed the red button.

933
01:11:58,109 --> 01:12:02,011
Computer at MiB can destroy
bogey. I'll walk you through it.

934
01:12:04,248 --> 01:12:08,913
Jay? Frank. You were the best darn
partner a Remoolian could ever have.

935
01:12:09,721 --> 01:12:10,983
Godspeed.

936
01:12:12,457 --> 01:12:13,480
Frank? Frank?

937
01:12:14,493 --> 01:12:17,154
Okay, here we go, automatic pilot.

938
01:12:19,430 --> 01:12:23,595
- lt is not automatic piloting.
- He doesn't operate at hyper-speed.

939
01:12:23,769 --> 01:12:27,170
- I could use a steering wheel!
- This is what we got.

940
01:12:28,974 --> 01:12:31,908
- Didn't you ever have a Game Boy?
- What's that?

941
01:12:32,077 --> 01:12:33,600
You know what? Move.

942
01:12:34,945 --> 01:12:37,278
That is not the navigational stalk!

943
01:12:49,261 --> 01:12:51,252
Okay, straight down.

944
01:12:55,966 --> 01:12:57,365
Idiots.

945
01:13:07,445 --> 01:13:10,243
Subway may not be the best place
to lose her.

946
01:13:12,617 --> 01:13:14,083
- Where is he?
- He?

947
01:13:14,485 --> 01:13:15,783
Jeff. Hang on!

948
01:13:18,090 --> 01:13:19,078
Oops.

949
01:13:20,292 --> 01:13:21,417
Teeth.

950
01:13:55,359 --> 01:13:58,351
Running out of time, Kay.
Where is the Light?

951
01:13:59,564 --> 01:14:01,054
Right here.

952
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:04,297
- What?
- What, I'm the Light?

953
01:14:05,203 --> 01:14:07,797
- No. No way.
- You have a planet to save.

954
01:14:07,972 --> 01:14:10,440
You're mistaken. I work at a pizzeria.

955
01:14:10,609 --> 01:14:14,568
Two days ago, I was running a post
office. You are who you are.

956
01:14:14,746 --> 01:14:17,840
Laura, you are the Light.

957
01:14:18,015 --> 01:14:21,747
The leader of your people.
Their spirit and their hope.

958
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:24,615
The power is within you
to save a planet.

959
01:14:24,789 --> 01:14:29,726
I protected you until it was
your time. Your time is now.

960
01:14:33,564 --> 01:14:37,331
You will save a world.
You know things before they happen.

961
01:14:37,502 --> 01:14:39,595
- I'm a Libra.
- You're Zarthan.

962
01:14:39,770 --> 01:14:44,002
- When you get sad, it rains.
- Lots of people get sad when it rains.

963
01:14:44,309 --> 01:14:47,005
It rains because you're sad, baby.

964
01:15:40,231 --> 01:15:41,823
It's not fair.

965
01:15:47,739 --> 01:15:49,365
Never is.

966
01:15:51,141 --> 01:15:52,769
We are who we are...

967
01:15:52,944 --> 01:15:55,435
... even if we sometimes forget.

968
01:16:04,855 --> 01:16:07,416
Jeff, I am so not in the mood for you!

969
01:16:07,591 --> 01:16:09,320
Get back in the subway!
Now!

970
01:16:15,867 --> 01:16:17,128
That's not good.

971
01:16:19,003 --> 01:16:20,528
Wait! No!

972
01:16:21,972 --> 01:16:23,304
Jay!

973
01:16:23,908 --> 01:16:28,346
I cannot emphasize strongly enough how
much we need you on that transport.

974
01:16:29,747 --> 01:16:32,046
Laura! You have to go!

975
01:16:32,484 --> 01:16:33,849
Oh, jeez.

976
01:16:35,886 --> 01:16:38,685
Go. He's fine.
He does this all the time.

977
01:16:39,791 --> 01:16:41,019
Nope!

978
01:16:43,395 --> 01:16:46,296
About to lay the smackdown
on your candy ass.

979
01:16:46,698 --> 01:16:49,029
Laura! It's your destiny!

980
01:16:49,266 --> 01:16:51,200
I was talking, Kay!

981
01:16:52,703 --> 01:16:54,864
Hey! No biting.

982
01:16:56,608 --> 01:16:59,007
If you don't go, we all die.

983
01:17:02,212 --> 01:17:04,773
You're just as beautiful
as your mother.

984
01:17:11,489 --> 01:17:13,752
Kay? A little help?

985
01:17:26,136 --> 01:17:27,262
Kay?

986
01:17:29,106 --> 01:17:31,631
Might I suggest a bigger gun?

987
01:17:58,168 --> 01:17:59,761
- Kid?
- Yeah.

988
01:18:00,238 --> 01:18:03,570
- Thanks for bringing me back.
- No problem.

989
01:18:04,175 --> 01:18:05,698
Why didn't you tell me?

990
01:18:05,877 --> 01:18:07,970
Would you have let her go?

991
01:18:29,434 --> 01:18:33,301
So, what's it like on the outside?
Not doing this every day?

992
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:34,904
It's nice.

993
01:18:35,073 --> 01:18:38,872
Sleep late on the weekends.
Watch the Weather Channel.

994
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:44,506
I did miss this city.

995
01:18:45,749 --> 01:18:49,277
So Laura is Princess Lauranna's
daughter.

996
01:18:51,189 --> 01:18:54,555
- Did y'all--?
- MiB's a mess. Let's go, kid.

997
01:18:55,359 --> 01:18:56,587
Let's go?

998
01:18:56,761 --> 01:19:01,027
Thousands of people in New York
and New Jersey saw our little event.

999
01:19:01,198 --> 01:19:05,568
Plan needs to be thought out.
Plan needs to be cool. What you--?

1000
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:12,208
Kid, I'll get you trained yet.

1001
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:13,900
I want one of those.

1002
01:19:14,078 --> 01:19:15,341
Damn!

1003
01:19:20,185 --> 01:19:21,378
- Hey.
- Hey.

1004
01:19:21,552 --> 01:19:23,987
- How you doing?
- I'm good.

1005
01:19:24,154 --> 01:19:28,682
We've all been there. The girl is gone
and it hurts. Wanna talk?

1006
01:19:28,859 --> 01:19:30,417
- No.
- I can help.

1007
01:19:30,595 --> 01:19:31,583
No.

1008
01:19:31,762 --> 01:19:32,820
Still sulking?

1009
01:19:32,997 --> 01:19:33,985
- No.
- Yeah.

1010
01:19:34,164 --> 01:19:38,396
You miss her. It happens to all of us.
I knew this hot young thing.

1011
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:42,164
When our bodies were in the positions
of the Kamasutra--

1012
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:43,636
Zed!

1013
01:19:44,074 --> 01:19:45,939
Come on, man! Damn!

1014
01:19:46,344 --> 01:19:48,038
I'll tell you about dames.

1015
01:19:48,212 --> 01:19:51,774
They say they want to be scratched,
but they really want:

1016
01:19:51,983 --> 01:19:53,609
Hey! Frank.

1017
01:19:53,818 --> 01:19:56,514
What? Still sitting shiva?
Want my advice?

1018
01:19:56,688 --> 01:19:58,587
No. No advice.

1019
01:19:58,756 --> 01:20:00,314
No talking.

1020
01:20:00,925 --> 01:20:02,221
Hell, no.

1021
01:20:02,392 --> 01:20:05,055
Fellas, I swear, I'm fine.

1022
01:20:06,029 --> 01:20:08,828
All hail Jay! All hail Jay!

1023
01:20:09,367 --> 01:20:12,962
- I brought them from Grand Central.
- Why put them in my locker?

1024
01:20:13,137 --> 01:20:15,470
I thought it would put things
in perspective.

1025
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:18,336
It's kind of sad.
We need to let them out.

1026
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:21,707
They need to know the world
is bigger than that.

1027
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:23,369
Still a rookie.

1028
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:27,743
Whoa.
