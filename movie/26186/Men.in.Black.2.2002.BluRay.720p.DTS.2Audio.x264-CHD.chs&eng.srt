00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:13,002
顺便到地下室搬一箱汽水
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew from the basement.

134
00:15:18,582 --> 00:15:23,112
两片香肠口味披萨  还有关于萨塔之光的消息
Two slices of pepperoni and information about the Light of Zartha.

135
00:15:23,282 --> 00:15:26,652
-求求你  别伤害我  -萨塔之光呢? 
- Whoever you are, don't hurt me. - Where's the Light, Ben?

136
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:30,262
我不知道你在说什么  把我放下来
I don't know what you're talking about. Let me down, ma'am.

137
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:32,522
我要报案...
 I want to report a robbery...

138
00:15:40,002 --> 00:15:41,592
后面
There.

139
00:15:42,172 --> 00:15:43,432
有声音
Noise.

140
00:15:44,972 --> 00:15:46,442
厨房啦! 
Kitchen!

141
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:52,472
你们两个猪头看到什么? 
You idiots see anything?

142
00:15:52,682 --> 00:15:55,712
后门被风吹开
Wind blew the door open.

143
00:15:56,382 --> 00:15:58,352
没什么异状
Nothing out of the ordinary.

144
00:15:58,722 --> 00:16:01,852
这25年来我寻遍宇宙
For 25 years, l've traveled the universe looking for it.

145
00:16:02,022 --> 00:16:04,962
但是它却还在地球  对吧? 你把它藏在这儿? 
But it never left Earth, did it? You kept it here.

146
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:06,862
你在说什么? 
What are you talking about?

147
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,552
我没时间了  萨塔之光呢? 
I'm running out of time. Where's the Light?

148
00:16:09,732 --> 00:16:12,532
-我发誓我不知道  -听好了  萨塔人
- I don't know what you mean. - Listen, Zarthan.

149
00:16:12,702 --> 00:16:15,262
你把它藏在地球  我会找到它
You hid the Light on Earth. I'll find it.

150
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:18,962
到时候萨塔星就是我的
Once we have the Light, Zartha will be ours.

151
00:16:19,172 --> 00:16:21,702
来不及了  明天午夜...
You're too late. Tomorrow at midnight

152
00:16:21,912 --> 00:16:25,372
它就会离开第三行星
the Light will leave the third planet and be back home.

153
00:16:25,582 --> 00:16:28,842
你白跑一趟了
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.

154
00:16:38,132 --> 00:16:40,692
东西到底在不在地球? 
Now we don't know if it's on Earth or not.

155
00:16:40,862 --> 00:16:43,262
第三行星就是地球  白痴
He said third planet. It's here, you idiot.

156
00:16:43,432 --> 00:16:47,132
-太阳数过来第三颗行星? -我到现在才知道耶
- Third Rock from the Sun. - I never got that till now.

157
00:16:47,642 --> 00:16:51,502
有一个人知道它的下落
It's on Earth, and I know who's gonna tell me where it is.

158
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:18,992
-你不回家吗? -没错
- Don't you ever go home? - Nope.

159
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:21,962
你又开除一个搭档
 I see you neuralyzed another partner.

160
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:31,202
你们下次用核融碳化枪...
Bee, Dee, when you use a fission carbonizer

161
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:35,112
记得在枪管上装原子消音器
attach a de-atomizer so it doesn't sound like a cannon.

162
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:39,582
穿鞋子吧  你刮花地板了
Hey, get some booties on them things. You're crapping up the floor.

163
00:17:42,992 --> 00:17:44,392
检查这砘锏幕ふ
Check his visa.

164
00:17:44,562 --> 00:17:48,722
乌贼人在伪造星际护照
The Cephalopods have been making counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.

165
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:54,162
这儿怎么会有一只死异形? 
And why do I have a dead Tricrainasloph going through passport control?

166
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:58,502
是我的错  对不起  请你别消除我的记忆
That'd be my fault. I'm very sorry. Please don't neuralyze me, sir.

167
00:17:58,712 --> 00:18:02,202
-那是什么意思? -没什么意思
- What the hell's that supposed to mean? - Nothing, sir.

168
00:18:05,712 --> 00:18:07,242
你在地铁站干得不错
Good work in the subway.

169
00:18:07,452 --> 00:18:11,352
-我记得杰夫以前才这么大  -还有什么任务? 
- I remember jeff when he was yea high. - What you got for me?

170
00:18:11,522 --> 00:18:13,822
看到下面那些穿黑西装的吗? 
Look. See those guys in black suits?

171
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:17,052
-他们也是星际战警  放轻松点  -Z  拜托  有什么任务? 
- They work here. We got it covered. - Zed, what you got?

172
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:21,462
尽忠职守是一回事  不过千万别为工作鞠躬尽瘁
Dedication's one thing, but this job will eat you up and spit you out.

173
00:18:21,632 --> 00:18:24,602
你想五十岁时也像我这样吗? ...
You want to look like me when you hit 50?

174
00:18:25,902 --> 00:18:26,922
五十几了?

175
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:30,032
我去健身房
I'll be in the gym if you need me.

176
00:18:30,702 --> 00:18:34,072
春泉街发生一起凶杀案
All right, there was a killing earlier. 177 Spring.

177
00:18:34,242 --> 00:18:35,542

Alien-on-alien.

178
00:18:35,712 --> 00:18:38,182

180
00:18:44,152 --> 00:18:46,952
护照加签  不是急件  怎么样? 
Passport, no rush, what about jay.

181
00:18:47,122 --> 00:18:50,152
你不能一直开除MiB员工
You have got to stop neuralyzing MiB personnel.

182
00:18:50,322 --> 00:18:52,552
那老兄在餐馆哭哭啼啼的
He was cryingin the middle of the diner.

183
00:18:52,732 --> 00:18:54,252

184
00:18:54,862 --> 00:18:57,062
而且L不算
And plus, you can't count Elle.

185
00:18:57,232 --> 00:19:00,172
是她自己想回停尸间的  我只是帮她个忙
She wanted to go back to the morgue. I helped her.

186
00:19:00,332 --> 00:19:03,242
-你需要一个搭档  -用不着
- You need a partner. - I'm cool.

187
00:19:03,572 --> 00:19:05,542
让我当他的搭档
I'll be his partner.

188

- Thought I'd never get out. - Lose the suit.

没问题  我只是想扮酷
Sure thing. just going for the look.

191
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:17,012
我穿黑西装看起来比较瘦
But if I say so myself, I find it slimming.

192
00:19:17,182 --> 00:19:19,812
不过我照样泡得到美眉
Not that l've had problems with the ladies.

193
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,582

196
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,582
弗兰克!

197
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:53,082
你再唱我就拿出狗头铡了
Bring your head in this window before I roll it up in there.

198

身材有点胖  不过脸很漂亮
A little thick in the body, but pretty.

203
00:20:11,172 --> 00:20:14,232
我对你的艳遇一点也不感兴趣

你负责问话  我负责耍狠
You interrogate the witness and I growl.

206

我们来扮好警察跟蠢狗  你给我乖乖闭嘴? 
How about we do the good cop, dumb dog thing, and you just shut up?

207
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:26,382
没问题  一声不响  寂静无声

她还蛮镇静的

216
00:20:52,752 --> 00:20:56,912
你要先跟我解释我才回答  这是怎么回事? 
I won't answer any more questions. I want to know what happened here.

-这最好让我来处理  -没问题
- I'll handle this one. - You got it.

218

An hour ago, a man l've known my whole life vanished

239

242
00:22:06,322 --> 00:22:10,052
我们小时候  还没上学之前...
When we're kids, before we're taught how to think

243
00:22:10,222 --> 00:22:13,562
心里都相信有外星人
our hearts tell us there is something else out there.

闪一下后...
After you flash me

255

00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:10,512
-你跟她说你爱她吗? -拜托  她只是目击证人
- Did you tell the girl you love her? - She's a witness to a crime. That's it.

265
00:24:11,152 --> 00:24:14,772
你迷上她了  我跟她不同种都迷上她了
You're attracted. She's not my species, and I'm attracted.

266
00:24:14,952 --> 00:24:18,912
你只会追着尾巴咬  哪懂得泡妞? 
I should take advice on love from a dude that chases his own ass?

267
00:24:19,092 --> 00:24:23,112
别这样  这是狗歧视
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling, and I resent it.

268
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:41,172
J  等等我
Hey, jay, wait up.

269
00:24:41,382 --> 00:24:44,342
借过  星际警犬来也
Coming through. MiB brass. Look sharp.

270
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:48,482
我是狗探员  J的新搭档  看什么看? 
I'm Agent Eff, jay's new partner. Who are you eyeballing?

271
00:24:48,652 --> 00:24:50,912
别紧张  狗狗
Frank, just cool out, dog.

272
00:24:52,692 --> 00:24:54,242
-你有小孩吗? -没有
- Got kids? - No.

273
00:24:54,422 --> 00:24:55,892
想要吗? 
Want them?

274
00:24:59,092 --> 00:25:01,062
快来帮我啊
Get him off me!

275
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:12,102
-怎么样? -卡洛琳星C级太空船
- Talk to me. - It's Kylothian, class C.

276
00:25:12,312 --> 00:25:13,272
塞琳娜
Serleena.

277
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,812
-塞琳娜  你前女友啊? -她想得美
- Serleena. Old girlfriend? - She wishes.

278
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:18,642
证人说嫌犯在找什么光...
The perps were looking for the Light of...

279
00:25:18,812 --> 00:25:20,472
-萨塔之光  -对  那是什么? 
- Zartha. - Yeah, what is it?

280
00:25:20,652 --> 00:25:23,122
没道理  那不在地球
This makes no sense. It's not on Earth.

281
00:25:23,282 --> 00:25:26,552
-我们早就搞定了  -很显然你们没搞定
- We took care of this a long time ago. - Obviously not.

282
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:28,752
真是坏消息
That is very bad news.

283
00:25:28,922 --> 00:25:32,622
25年前萨塔人来到地球  想把萨塔之光藏起来
The Zarthans came to Earth to hide the Light from Serleena.

284
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:36,292
-我们不能这么做  -没错  我命令他们把它带走
- We don't do that. - Right. I ordered it off the planet.

285
00:25:36,462 --> 00:25:38,092
嗯  Z...
Well, Zed.

286
00:25:38,272 --> 00:25:40,562
中央公园有一艘卡洛琳太空船 
I got a Kylothian class C in my park.

287
00:25:40,562 --> 00:25:42,702
你确定萨塔之光不在这儿?
 Are you sure this Light isn't here?

288
00:25:42,872 --> 00:25:46,472
确定  我派最顶尖的探员处理的
Positive. I gave the order. My best agent carried it out.

289
00:25:46,672 --> 00:25:49,202
-跟我交给你一样放心  -那就去问他呀
- It's as if I gave it to you. - Ask the agent.

290
00:25:49,412 --> 00:25:50,472
-办不到  -他挂了? 
- Can't. - Dead?

291
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:53,812
差不多  他在邮局上班
Sort of. He works at the post office.

292
00:25:54,982 --> 00:25:56,112
不是吧
No.

293
00:25:56,282 --> 00:25:58,952
要是K先被塞琳娜找到就死定了
If Serleena gets to kay before we do, he's dead.

294
00:25:59,122 --> 00:26:02,152
地球的命运握在他手上
The Earth's very existence may rest on what Kay knows.

295
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:04,792
可惜你消除了他的记忆
Too bad you wiped out his memory of it.

296
00:26:04,962 --> 00:26:06,452
把他带回来
Bring him in.

297
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:07,822
马上去
Now.

298
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:12,062
酷毙了  我们去找K探员  传奇人物  办案高手
How cool is this? Going to get Kay. The legend, the go-to guy.

299
00:26:12,232 --> 00:26:14,762
把一身本领传授给你的师父
The guy who taught you everything.

300
00:26:14,942 --> 00:26:19,572
-MiB史上最伟大的探员  -弗兰克! 别再说话了
- The greatest agent in MiB history! - Frank! Stop talking.

301
00:26:23,412 --> 00:26:24,672
乖乖坐着
Stay.

302
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:27,442
喂  我虽看起来像小狗  但那只是...
Listen, partner. I may look like a dog

303
00:26:27,612 --> 00:26:30,082
我在地球的掩护
but I only play one here on Earth.

304
00:26:30,452 --> 00:26:32,922
-随便啦  擦擦口水  -喂  辣妹
- Whatever. Wipe your mouth. - Hey, babe.

305
00:26:39,292 --> 00:26:42,592
各位特鲁罗镇民请大家注意听
People of Truro, may I kindly have your attention?

306

每一件包裹都要正确包装
All packages must be properly wrapped.

308
00:26:48,202 --> 00:26:52,072
这一个就是错误的示范
This one is an example of "go home and do it again."

309
00:26:52,272 --> 00:26:55,042
维吉辛太太  我想就是你的
I think you know what I mean, Mrs. Vigushin.

310
00:26:55,242 --> 00:27:00,082

314
00:27:10,862 --> 00:27:14,052
凯文  真好笑  你不太像凯文...
Kevin. That's funny. You don't have a "Kevin".

315
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,032
你不记得我  我们一起工作过
You don't remember. We worked together.

316
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:23,302
我没在殡仪馆上过班  帅哥  有什么我能效劳吗? 
l never worked in a funeral home. Something I can do for you, slick?

317
00:27:23,472 --> 00:27:25,102
我就直说吧

You were an agent of an organization that monitors aliens on Earth.

We're the Men in Black. We have a situation. We need your help.

美国邮政总署没跟得上潮流...
The Postal Service hasn't kept up with today's youth, but we have

324
00:27:47,562 --> 00:27:50,222
我们有二战纪念邮票  歌剧名伶? 
Berlin airlift stamps. Opera legends?

325
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,372

你当年并没昏迷  那全是幌子
There was no coma. It was a cover.

328
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,642
-你是谁? -问题是  你是谁? 
- Who are you? - Who are you?

我是麻省特鲁罗镇邮局局长  我命令你离开这儿
The postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts, and I'm ordering you to leave.

Listen to yourself, Kay. Who talks like that?

335
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,952
难怪你在这里如鱼得水
Why do you think you're so comfortable here?

336
00:29:24,522 --> 00:29:28,362
邮局员工几乎全是外星人

我跟我太太到赌城看过魔术师让白老虎飞起来
My wife and I saw Siegfried and Roy fly a tiger around a room.

339
00:29:52,222 --> 00:29:53,712
小子  你这套把戏还不够看
You're nothing special.

340
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,792
当你抬头看星星  内心深处...
When you look at the stars, you get a feeling

341
00:29:56,962 --> 00:29:58,952
不知道自己是谁
like you don't know who you are.

342
00:29:59,132 --> 00:30:02,762
你对外星的了解甚于你自己
Like you know more about out there than you do down here.

343
00:30:02,932 --> 00:30:07,532
所以你老婆才会离开你
That's why she left you, Kay. That's why your wife left you.

344
00:30:09,542 --> 00:30:11,372

要不然你就回去送信吧
If not, people are waiting for their TV Guides.

347
00:30:22,652 --> 00:30:24,142
他来不来? 
Think he'll bite?

348
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:33,792
我就跟你去一趟  事情不对劲我就马上走人
I'm just going for a ride. lf things don't add up, it's hasta luego.

Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.

525
00:44:33,572 --> 00:44:36,092
-小鬼  你差点就没命  -我搞得定
- You were in a tight spot. - I handled it.

526
00:44:36,272 --> 00:44:39,072
-你需要一个搭档  -我本来有啊  但他应付不来
- You need a partner. - I had one. job got too tough.

527
00:44:39,272 --> 00:44:41,572
我回来了  你的衣服脏了
I'm back. You got some dust on your coat.

528
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:43,642
你的记忆恢复了? 
So you got your memory back.

529
00:44:43,812 --> 00:44:46,242
-这是怎么回事? -不知道
- What the hell is going on? - Don't know.

530
00:44:46,412 --> 00:44:48,882
-萨塔之光是什么? -从没听过
- The Light of Zartha? - Never heard of it.

531
00:44:49,052 --> 00:44:50,072
好耶
Cool.

532
00:44:53,422 --> 00:44:55,752
你不记得萨塔之光? 
You don't remember the Light of Zartha?

533
00:44:55,922 --> 00:44:58,622
我一定消除了这部份的记忆
Must've neuralyzed myself to keep it from myself.

534
00:44:58,792 --> 00:45:02,062
-棒极了  你在干嘛? -一向都是我开车
- Good plan. What you doing? - I do the driving.

535
00:45:02,232 --> 00:45:04,222
-不对  -我记得
- Wait, no. Whoa. - I remember that.

536
00:45:04,402 --> 00:45:08,332
你以前开的是那辆破车
What you remember is you used to drive that old, busted jawn.

537
00:45:08,502 --> 00:45:11,562
我开的是全新炫车
 I drive the new hotness.

538
00:45:11,772 --> 00:45:15,372
你开破车  我开炫车
Old and busted, new hotness.

539
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:26,412
我的炫车完蛋了
Old busted hotness.

540
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:29,482
-塞琳娜  求求你  -好久不见
- Serleena, please. - Been a long time, Zed.

541
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:33,282
你还记得我  我好感动哦  让我一直弄不清楚
I'm just touched you remembered me. Makes me fuzzy all over.

542
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:36,792
不管你漂不漂亮我都不会忘记
Never forget a pretty whatever you are.

543
00:45:41,102 --> 00:45:42,762
Z? 看看你
Zed? Look at you.

544
00:45:42,942 --> 00:45:45,932
25年了  你还是这么帅
Twenty-five years, and you're still such a looker.

545
00:45:46,142 --> 00:45:47,832
我吃素
Cut out the meat and dairy.

546
00:45:48,042 --> 00:45:51,812
看看你  你还是这么心狠手辣
And you, still a pile of squirmy crap in a different wrapper.

547
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:55,812
你好猛哦  听着  我们都需要一样东西
So feisty. Look, we both need the same thing.

548
00:45:58,722 --> 00:46:00,242
把他叫回来
Bring him in.

549
00:46:00,922 --> 00:46:02,012
想都别想
Don't think so.

550
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:03,882
你忘了萨塔之光的秘密吗?
What about the Light's secret?

551
00:46:03,882 --> 00:46:06,152
它午夜不离开地球就会爆炸...
If it's not off Earth by midnight

552
00:46:06,332 --> 00:46:09,762
摧毁这小小的地球
it self-destructs, annihilating your little planet.

553
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:13,802
我输了你也玩完了  我赢了就一切照旧
I lose, you lose. I win, everything keeps spinning.

554
00:46:14,202 --> 00:46:18,162
你也不想把萨塔之光留下来
You don't want the Light on Earth any more than I do.

555
00:46:20,812 --> 00:46:22,472
好吧  塞琳娜
All right, Serleena.

556
00:46:23,782 --> 00:46:25,612
你赢了
You win.

557
00:46:27,212 --> 00:46:30,552
Z? 是你吗? 我可以当M探员
Zed? Is that you? I could be Agent Em.

558
00:46:30,922 --> 00:46:32,352
喂? 
Zed. Hello?

559
00:46:42,862 --> 00:46:44,922
你真勇猛
So feisty.

560
00:46:49,402 --> 00:46:53,062
回总部的捷径是39街右转
Fastest way back to MiB, you take this right on 39th.

561
00:46:53,272 --> 00:46:54,802
这儿右转
Right here. Right.

562
00:46:57,012 --> 00:46:58,742
下一条是37街
Next right on 37th.

563
00:46:58,912 --> 00:47:01,382
右转  快右转
Right here. Right!

564
00:47:01,712 --> 00:47:03,272
我们不回总部
We're not going back.

565
00:47:03,452 --> 00:47:08,512
总部被占领了  我们要回去大开杀戒
Headquarters has been breached, man. We need to peel caps and split wigs.

566
00:47:08,692 --> 00:47:10,312
还不行
Not ready.

567
00:47:10,762 --> 00:47:14,212
你离开了五年  情况完全改变
Look, you've been out for five years. That's a long time.

568
00:47:14,392 --> 00:47:17,492
我知道你一定很害怕  老实说我也有一点怕
I understand you're scared. I'm a little scared too.

569
00:47:17,662 --> 00:47:19,722
-我才不害怕  -我也不怕
- I'm not scared. - Me neither.

570
00:47:20,302 --> 00:47:22,702
我只是想跟你谈谈心
 I just thought we was bonding.

571
00:47:23,542 --> 00:47:27,632
五年后你还是个菜鸟  你只会大开杀戒
You're acting like a rookie. Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.

572
00:47:27,842 --> 00:47:31,872
-怪不得Z要我回来  -是你搞砸了才找你回来的
- No wonder Zed brought me back. - He did it because you messed up.

573
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:34,772
你这种态度很没有建设性
Your attitude makes for a stressful environment.

574
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:39,012
我才不听你说教  现在MiB总部的麻烦大了
Tell it to the hand. Stressful is what we got back at MiB.

575
00:47:39,192 --> 00:47:41,662
塞琳娜认为我知道东西的下落 
Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB

576
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:43,782
所以她才占领MiB总部
in order to lure me back.

577
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:46,022
守株待兔
lnto a trap.

578
00:47:46,192 --> 00:47:48,752
所以我们不能硬闯进去
Which is why we can't bust in there.

579
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:51,922
我们要有计划  现在要去案发现场吗? 
We need a plan. Where we going? Scene of the crime?

580
00:47:52,102 --> 00:47:56,302
-你是老大  -没错  那就左转吧
- You're the boss. - Scene of the crime. That's a left.

581
00:47:58,772 --> 00:48:01,262
我去找证人  跟她谈谈
I'll contact the witness. We'll talk to her.

582
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:04,672
事情都不同了  我们以前都会消除证人的记忆
Things have changed. We used to neuralyze witnesses.

583
00:48:06,012 --> 00:48:07,742
是这样啦...
See, originally, I'd...

584
00:48:08,752 --> 00:48:13,242
我本来...我会再问她话
No, I was going to... I interrogated her.

585
00:48:13,422 --> 00:48:15,082
-你要消除她的记忆  -什么意思? 
- Then neuralyzed her? - What?

586
00:48:15,252 --> 00:48:20,662
MiB行动手册第773/I-1条款规定...
MiB code 7 73ll-1 clearly states that all civilian personnel...

587
00:48:21,662 --> 00:48:23,152
-把武器放下! -住手! 
- Drop that weapon! - No!

588
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:24,922
J  对不起
jay, I'm... I'm sorry.

589
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:28,032
我没事  这是我的错
No, no, I'm fine. It's my fault.

590
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:30,842
K是我搭档  劳拉是证人
Kay, my partner. Laura, the witness.

591
00:48:31,002 --> 00:48:32,132
幸会
Pleasure.

592
00:48:33,442 --> 00:48:37,972
谢谢你派探员来保护我
Thanks for sending those agents over to keep an eye on me last night.

593
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,152
MiB第594-B条款规定...
MiB procedural code 594-B

594
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:43,512
探员不得进行其它服务....
states that MiB personnel shall never be used

595
00:48:43,682 --> 00:48:49,022
萨塔人班在这里遇害  我猜凶手在这个方向
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here. I assume the perp was over here.

596
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:50,752
班
Ben.

597
00:48:50,922 --> 00:48:53,762
-五英尺七英寸  矮胖秃头? -你认识他? 
- Was he 5'7", thinning hair? - You knew him?

598
00:48:54,192 --> 00:48:56,422
不认识  我没见过他
Nope. Never seen him before in my life.

599
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,502
好大的一条鱼
That is a hell of a fish.

600
00:49:01,702 --> 00:49:03,502
等一下
Wait a minute.

601
00:49:08,672 --> 00:49:10,072
你留下了线索? 
You left yourself clues?

602
00:49:10,242 --> 00:49:14,242
以免我的接班人搞不清楚状况
In case I was deneuralyzed because my replacement couldn't handle it.

603
00:49:14,452 --> 00:49:19,112
是你先把事情搞砸...
If the joker that had got deneuralyzed hadn't created the situation

604
00:49:19,292 --> 00:49:20,622
两位
Boys.

605
00:49:22,522 --> 00:49:25,422
好  你指着什么东西
All right. You pointing at something.

606
00:49:29,602 --> 00:49:30,962
借过
Excuse me.

607
00:49:32,502 --> 00:49:34,092
太空人
The astronaut.

608
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,632
他在指...
Okay, all right. He's pointing...

609
00:49:39,842 --> 00:49:41,812
他在指着...
He's like...

610
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:46,342
谁会这么放披萨盒? 
Who would stack boxes like this?

611
00:49:46,512 --> 00:49:50,352
这绝对不是乱放的  这是一个线索
A box stacker who's not stacking boxes. He's leaving clues.

612
00:49:50,522 --> 00:49:52,012
这是箭头
It's an arrow.

613
00:49:56,162 --> 00:49:58,422
-J? -别耽误我  K
- jay? - You're slowing me down, slick.

614
00:49:58,592 --> 00:50:02,222
我们找的东西在柜子里
Whatever we're looking for is in these cabinets, right here.

615
00:50:03,632 --> 00:50:06,692
用橄榄油泡的鲍鱼罐头
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.

616
00:50:10,242 --> 00:50:12,602
希望我没有耽误你
 I hope I'm not slowing you down.

617
00:50:13,242 --> 00:50:15,832
干得好  伙伴
Good work, partner. Yeah.

618
00:50:16,042 --> 00:50:18,942
-我们要查出这是哪里的钥匙  -我知道
- We gotta figure out where it goes. - I know where.

619
00:50:19,242 --> 00:50:23,372
-还不行  -MiB第773条款规定...
- No. Not yet. - MiB code 773 clearly says

620
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:26,752
我知道  可是她对我很重要
I know the code, but she might be important to me.

621
00:50:27,352 --> 00:50:29,842
是我们  她能帮助我们
To us. Well, for help. To help us later.

622
00:50:30,522 --> 00:50:33,222
她不能留在这儿  他们会回来的
Well, she can't stay here. They'll be back.

623
00:50:35,932 --> 00:50:39,632
-你可以去找我朋友  -他们跟你一样吗? 
- You can stay with friends of mine. - People like you?

624
00:50:39,932 --> 00:50:40,922
算是吧
Kind of.

625
00:50:41,102 --> 00:50:42,662
老兄! 
jay!

626
00:50:42,842 --> 00:50:45,332
-小心头喔! -怎么样? 
- Low bridge! - What's going on, man?

627
00:50:45,502 --> 00:50:48,772
大家好  MiB总部被占领
Hey, what's happening, fellas? MiB is code 101 .

630
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:56,812
小心点! 
Easy, easy!

631
00:50:56,982 --> 00:50:57,972
他们是虫虫
They're worms.

632
00:50:58,152 --> 00:51:01,452
虫虫会让你蠢蠢欲动
Once you go worm, that's what you'll yearn.

633
00:51:01,622 --> 00:51:04,952
-他们都这么说  -我交过更糟的男友
- That's what they say. They just: - l've dated worse.

634
00:51:05,492 --> 00:51:08,092
他们偷了免税商品被停职
They're suspended for stealing from duty-free.

635
00:51:08,262 --> 00:51:11,062
-有人故意栽贼  -Z超怕虫
- We were framed. - Zed's wormophobic.

636
00:51:11,232 --> 00:51:12,532

637
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:15,432
-听说你挂了  -我们违规停车
- They said you were dead. - We're double-parked.

638
00:51:15,602 --> 00:51:17,502
好  劳拉对我很重要
Laura's very important to me.

639
00:51:18,202 --> 00:51:21,802
她对我们的任务很重要
To us. To the stuff, Me and you, the stuff we're doing.

640
00:51:22,982 --> 00:51:25,912
-我要请你们替我照顾她  -我会好好的给她照顾
- Keep an eye on her. - I'll keep both on her.

641
00:51:26,112 --> 00:51:27,082
安啦! 
No problem!

642
00:51:29,352 --> 00:51:32,112
-过来坐吧? -你泡不到她啦
- Why don't you sit here? - Like you got a shot.

643
00:51:32,282 --> 00:51:33,442
给我闭嘴! 
Hey, shut up!

644
00:51:36,622 --> 00:51:39,322
这是我的通讯器  以防万一
My communicator, in case you need it.

645
00:51:42,962 --> 00:51:44,592
-上垒了  -这样啊
- Nice move. - Okay.

646
00:51:47,232 --> 00:51:51,032
-小心尼巴  -哪一个是尼巴? 
- just watch out for Neeble. - Which one's Neeble?

647
00:51:53,512 --> 00:51:55,702
-哪一个是尼巴? -喂  辣妹
- Which one of y'all is Neeble? - Yo, mama!

648
00:51:55,912 --> 00:52:00,072
那就是他  没问题了  你很安全
Him, right there. It's fine. Everything's straight. It's safe.

649
00:52:00,252 --> 00:52:02,212
千万别睡着
Don't fall asleep.

650
00:52:03,982 --> 00:52:05,642
来玩扭扭乐! 
Twister!

651
00:52:07,652 --> 00:52:12,322
我再把你的计划说一次  我被搞糊涂了
Run over your plan one more time. I'm struggling with it.

652
00:52:12,492 --> 00:52:16,392
你把萨塔之光的记忆消除  但是却替自己留下线索
You neuralyzed memory of the Light but left yourself clues.

653
00:52:16,562 --> 00:52:17,552
没错
Right.

745
00:57:40,892 --> 00:57:44,792
但他们有一个宝物  萨塔之星

它拥有威力强大的能量...
A source of power so awesome, it alone

747
00:57:48,492 --> 00:57:52,092
它可以让萨塔人获得胜利...

748
00:57:52,262 --> 00:57:56,702
但落入敌手后果就不堪设想

算你聪明

kay, please. If Serleena takes the Light, it's the end of our world.

759
00:58:26,872 --> 00:58:30,202
如果把萨塔之光藏在地球
If we extend protection for the Light beyond Earth

760
00:58:30,372 --> 00:58:33,702
地球就会受到威胁  我们别无选择  必须保持中立
we put Earth in jeopardy. We must remain neutral.

761
00:58:33,942 --> 00:58:36,462
-东西在哪儿? -我们要保持中立? 
- Where is it? - We're neutral, remember?

762
00:58:36,712 --> 00:58:38,842
你要的话就去拿吧

不! 
No!

764
00:59:13,752 --> 00:59:16,042
这事件被历史淹没

而且欧普拉不是来自芝加哥
They were telling me about Oprah, from Chicago.

790
01:00:47,842 --> 01:00:51,002
她在芝加哥降落才对

你怎么不说我爱你?

他是只狗耶  我才不爱它 
He's a dog. I don't even like him.

801
01:01:19,852 --> 01:01:22,172
我是说那女孩  你喜欢她
No, the girl. You're sweet on her.

802
01:01:22,372 --> 01:01:25,472
所以你没消除她的记忆  你对她产生感情
That's why you didn't neuralyze her. You got emotionally involved.

803
01:01:25,682 --> 01:01:30,142
-就像你对劳拉一样? -我对她的感情让地球陷入危机
- Like you did with Lauranna? - I put the entire planet in danger.

807
01:01:47,932 --> 01:01:48,962

他们丢了一半小命
Never stood half a chance.

809

815
01:02:13,362 --> 01:02:14,422

Don't worry, folks. I used to live here. Came to pick up a few things.

823

Which could be the next 28 minutes, so get to loving and cherishing.

828
01:03:25,662 --> 01:03:28,332
小朋友多晚睡都没关系...
And she can stay up as late as she want

829
01:03:28,502 --> 01:03:31,132
尽量让她多吃饼干和糖果

我可是击退了奎朗人
 I saved the world from a Kreelon invasion.

836
01:04:03,232 --> 01:04:07,402
奎朗人是出了名的逊  他们对着你丢雪球吗? 
They're the Backstreet Boys of the universe. They throw snowballs?

837
01:04:08,212 --> 01:04:09,672
你知道自己在干嘛吗?

840
01:04:16,412 --> 01:04:17,682
等等! 
No, no, wait!

841
01:04:23,452 --> 01:04:25,752
总部被全面封锁! 
A code 1 01 lockdown!

我知道啦  整栋大楼都加压 
The building gets pressurized.

843
01:04:28,092 --> 01:04:29,952
进出不得  我当然知道
 Nothing in, nothing out. I knew that.

844
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,152
才怪  虫虫  进攻! 
Yeah, you knew. Front and center, worms!

- Worm guys, give me some cover fire. - Too scared, can't move.

- What's it been? Five years? - And 42 days.

863
01:06:35,292 --> 01:06:37,662
蹲苦窖的日子我记得一清二楚
You count every one when you're locked away.

864
01:06:37,662 --> 01:06:42,562
你不该偷走臭氧层  我一分钟后就来救你
You shouldn't have tried to steal our ozone. Be there in one minute.

865
01:06:43,162 --> 01:06:45,762

Over our dead titanium bodies!

866
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:47,402
两分钟
Two minutes.

867
01:06:54,072 --> 01:06:55,872
这次可能要久一点
Let's play this one by ear.

-我早该把你消灭掉  -你真的很爱劳拉
- I should have vaporized you before. - You really did love Lauranna.

869
01:07:03,082 --> 01:07:04,952
对吧? 
Didn't you, Kay?

870
01:07:05,252 --> 01:07:07,272
你这个痴心汉
You silly little man.

871
01:07:35,512 --> 01:07:37,572
2分钟后发射
Two minutes to launch.

872
01:07:39,522 --> 01:07:40,952
快逃吧  我不会有事

873
01:07:41,752 --> 01:07:44,242
别胡说八道  我赢了耶
What you talking about? I'm winning.

874
01:07:44,422 --> 01:07:48,452
你这么丑还有这么多分身...
jarra, you are under arrest for being that ugly

875
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:51,422
我要把你关进大牢  快投降吧!

-该怎么切断电源呀? -我不知道
- Where do we shut off the power? - Don't know.

880
01:08:27,002 --> 01:08:30,902

- What did you mean, leave you? - Well, he took your gun.

887

揍你的脑袋  把你摔得惨兮兮
Cracked your head. Slammed you across the room.

888
01:09:27,092 --> 01:09:31,152
-你被打到满地爬  -这是苦肉计
- Half the time you were on your back. - Look, that's how I fight.

889
01:09:31,862 --> 01:09:34,332
你输了
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

890
01:09:34,502 --> 01:09:37,562
你白白浪费我25年的时间? 
You've wasted 25 years of my time, and for what?

891
01:09:37,802 --> 01:09:41,832
萨塔星还是会被摧毁  都是你一时心软
The total annihilation of Zartha. All because you went mushy.

892
01:09:42,042 --> 01:09:46,242
你这软骨头  快投降吧
I'll give you one last chance to surrender, you slimy invertebrate.

893
01:09:46,412 --> 01:09:49,972
-你能阻止我吗? -我不能  他能
- What are you gonna do to stop me? - Not me. Him.

894
01:09:52,022 --> 01:09:54,312
你的班机被取消了
Your flight's been canceled.

895
01:10:01,032 --> 01:10:02,902
切断电源  切断电源 
Shut down power. Shut down power.

896
01:10:02,902 --> 01:10:05,462
好多按钮哦  我用猜的...
Buttons, buttons. I'm guessing

897
01:10:05,632 --> 01:10:06,762
对啦
Yeah.

898
01:10:08,832 --> 01:10:11,102
-虫虫! -抱歉

899
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:18,802

大家上车  都上车
Everybody in the car. Everybody.

901
01:10:34,892 --> 01:10:37,762
萨塔之光竟然是这条手链? 
This bracelet is what everybody's been after?

902
01:10:37,932 --> 01:10:39,662
有时候小东西也很重要
It's often something small.

903
01:10:39,832 --> 01:10:43,492
手链只会显示出发点
It's not the Light. It tells us the departure point.

904
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:45,862
11分钟后赶不到那儿...
lf we don't get there in 1 1 minutes

905
01:10:46,042 --> 01:10:49,102
手链就会爆炸  摧毁地球
that bracelet will go nuclear and destroy Earth.

906
01:10:49,312 --> 01:10:50,742
什么? 
What?!

907
01:10:51,382 --> 01:10:52,342
你们好
Hello.

908
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,902
-慢着  -我搞得定啦
- Wait. - I know what I'm doing.

909
01:11:10,392 --> 01:11:11,382
可恶
Damn.

910
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:16,292
-这辆车有高速功能! -系好安全带
- Modified to hyper-speed! - Seat belts.

911
01:11:19,702 --> 01:11:20,732
这是什么? 
What's that?

912
01:11:20,942 --> 01:11:24,312
高速操控器  用来控制方向
At hyper-speed, you have to use the navigational stalk.

913
01:11:28,582 --> 01:11:33,642
用开关切换左右副翼  用摇杆控制升降和速度
Toggle switches for the ailerons. joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.

914
01:11:38,062 --> 01:11:39,892
我要你知道....

你搞错了  我在披萨店打工
You're mistaken. I work at a pizzeria.

劳拉  你非走不可
Laura! You have to go!

962

你会让她走吗? 
Would you have let her go?

977

当平凡人的感觉如何? 不必每天出生入死
So, what's it like on the outside? Not doing this every day?

978
01:18:36,872 --> 01:18:38,272
