1
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:28,690
Mysteries in History, with your host, Peter Graves.

2
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,740
Although no one has ever been able to prove their existence

3
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,040
a quasi-government agency, the Men in Black

4
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,550
supposedly carries out operationshere on Earth

5
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,810
in order to keep us safe from aliens throughout the galaxies.

6
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,480
Here is one of their stories that "never happened"

7
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,860
from one of their files that doesn't exist.

8
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,300
1978. The leaders of Zartha flee their planet

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,030
in order to escape the clutches of the evil kylothian, Serleena.

10
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,440
Arriving on Earth, the Zarthans bring with them their greatest treasure:

11
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:11,370
The Light of Zartha, a cosmic force so powerful..

12
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,540
that in the wrong hands it could lead to the annihilation of Zartha.

13
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:20,490
The Zarthans' princess, Lauranna, beseeched the Men in Black

14
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,020
to hide the Light from Serleena.

15
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,460
But they had no choice.

16
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:29,120
Intervention would have meant the destruction of the Earth.

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:35,600
However, in an act of galactic bravery, the Men in Black subdued Serleena

18
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,000
allowing the Zarthans to escape.

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:41,840
so they might hide the Light on another planet.

20
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,640
Serleena, released from her captors, vowed that the Light would be hers

21
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,750
and that she would destroy any planet that stood in her way.

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,720
And so, never knowing what happened

23
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,060
the people of Earth were saved by a secret society of protectors

24
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,290
known as the Men in Black.

25
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,960
Harvey, get over here!

26
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,630
Harvey. Heel, heel!

27
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,040
You're barking at the moon, moron.

28
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:55,840
Harvey!

29
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,840
Harvey!

30
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,040
Harvey!

31
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,100
Hey, pretty lady.

32
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,730
You taste good.

33
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,170
Hey, what the...?

34
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,680
Yeah, you too.

35
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,200
Nothing fancy, no heroics. By the book.

36
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,840
Got it. Hey!

37
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,300
Hey, jeff. What's happening, buddy?

38
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,430
- We were wondering why you're here.  - The man's talking to you.

39
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:20,870
You know our arrangements. Stay in the E, F and R subway lines

40
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,480
and you get all the garbage you want.

41
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,420
What the hell are you doing here, worm boy?

42
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,590
Tee.

43
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,550
jeff...

44
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,890
Excuse my partner. He's new and he's

45
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,890
kind of stupid.

46
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,710
You getting big, jeff. Boy, what you been eating?

47
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,680
You like jokes, huh?

48
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,840
jeffrey!

49
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,160
All right.

50
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,460
Sweet dreams, big boy.

51
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,060
Sweet dreams.

52
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,210
Transit authority. Move to the forward car.

53
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,970
We got a bug in the electrical system.

54
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:06,080
People! We got a bug in the electrical system!

55
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,620
Now y'all running?

56
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:13,490
No, no, no! Sit down!

57
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,630
lt's only a 600-foot worm.

58
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,960
- Everybody out.  - Put the hammer down on this thing.

59
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,600
l'm Captain Larry Bridgewater. l decide what happens.

60
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,400
You decide? Okay, come here. Come here.

61
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,640
Larry? That's my man, jeff.

62
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:39,150
- Larry just made a decision.  - Larry need to take his ass in there.

63
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:49,130
Don't make me do this, jeff!

64
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,790
Eighty-first Street.

65
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,990
just a second.

66
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:26,160
May l have your attention, please?

67
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,570
We thank youfor participating in our drill.

68
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:32,800
Had this been an emergency, you'd have been eaten.

69
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:35,530
Because you don't listen. You're ignorant.

70
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,870
How a man gonna bash through!  That's the problem with New Yorkers.

71
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,680
"We've seen it all. A 600-foot worm! Save us, Mr. Black Man!"

72
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,050
l ask you nice, "Move to the next car." You just sit there like.

73
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,650
Thank you for participating.

74
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:55,730
Hopefully, you enjoyed our smaller, energy-efficient subway cars.

75
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:59,290
Watch your step. You will have a nice evening.

76
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,470
l need a cleanup crew at 81 st and Central Park West.

77
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,130
Revoke jeff's movement privileges.

78
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,140
Have him escorted to the Chamber Street station.

79
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:17,270
And please check the expiration date on the unipod worm tranquilizers.

80
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,490
Sorry, fellas. Station closed.

81
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:27,990
- Emergency drill. For your safety.  - Do you believe these putzes?

82
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,090
You're welcome.

83
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:47,010
l know, by the book.

84
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,640
Tee, when was the last time we just looked at the stars?

85
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,820
This is a test. l can do this.

86
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,820
Ever feel like you're alone in the universe?

87
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,490
Yes.

88
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,130
No.

89
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,430
- Hey, let me buy you a piece of pie.  - Really?

90
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,400
Thanks.

91
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,940
Hey, you're not alone in the universe.

92
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,310
- Remove the arm.  - Okay.

93
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,340
Please, shut up, Charlie.

94
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,180
l'm tired of you constantly talking behind my back.

95
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:32,820
You meet a girl. She's into it. The best line you come up with is:

96
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,120
Wanna come back to my place for some tonsil hockey and egg salad?

97
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,960
- Who are you and how'd you get in here?  - You like egg salad?

98
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,640
Serleena!

99
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,040
Why didn't you say it was you?

100
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,400
- Where's the Light?  - Here's the deal.

101
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:54,950
You're looking for this Light. We found it.

102
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,420
You want it, it'll cost you 50 mill. Here's how it'll work. First...

103
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:02,560
Where is the Light?

104
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,800
We couldn't find it, but we found a guy who might know where it is.

105
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:15,030
He runs a pizza parlor on Spring Street.

106
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:20,170
Let's go. And wipe your nose, idiot.

107
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,350
- Good pie.  - Yeah.

108
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,350
Crowded.

109
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:34,280
Well, they got good pie.

110
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,090
What is wrong with you?

111
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,460
- You're gonna neuralyze me.  - No, l'm not.

112
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,190
You took me here so l wouldn't make a scene.

113
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,170
You making a scene.

114
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,200
Let me ask you a question. Why did you join MiB?

115
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,900
Six years in the Marines. l like the action. Protect the planet.

116
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:59,380
You like being a hero? You joined the wrong organization.

117
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,540
- You ever heard of james Edwards?  - No.

118
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,720
Well, he saved the lives of 85 people on the subway tonight.

119
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,890
No one knows he exists.

120
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,330
And if no one knows he exists, how can anyone ever love him?

121
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,330
Hey, how long we been partners?

122
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,470
- Feb 1.  - Five months, three days.

123
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:27,340
- Started at noon.  - Nine hours.

124
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,850
Get married. Have a bunch of kids.

125
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,010
Okay.

126
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:47,290
Excuse me. My buddy's kind of shy, but he thinks you are hot.

127
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,620
Here it is.

128
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,700
l don't know what to say.

129
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:59,810
Years from now, you know what people'll say?

130
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,310
- "Employee" is misspelled?  - They charge by the letter.

131
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:07,610
They'll say, "lmagine that. Big shot like her used to work here."

132
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,180
- Ben  - You deserve it.

133
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,480
Bring up a case of Mountain Dew from the basement.

134
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:22,590
Two slices of pepperoni and information about the Light of Zartha.

135
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,130
- Whoever you are, don't hurt me.  - Where's the Light, Ben?

136
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,740
l don't know what you're talking about. Let me down, ma'am.

137
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,000
l want to report a robbery...

138
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,070
There.

139
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:42,910
Noise.

140
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,920
Kitchen!

141
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,950
You idiots see anything?

142
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,190
Wind blew the door open.

143
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,830
Nothing out of the ordinary.

144
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,330
For 25 years, l've traveled the universe looking for it.

145
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,440
But it never left Earth, did it? You kept it here.

146
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:06,340
What are you talking about?

147
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,030
l'm running out of time. Where's the Light?

148
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,010
- l don't know what you mean.  - Listen, Zarthan.

149
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:14,740
You hid the Light on Earth. l'll find it.

150
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:18,440
Once we have the Light, Zartha will be ours.

151
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,180
You're too late. Tomorrow at midnight

152
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,850
the Light will leave the third planet and be back home.

153
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:28,320
Sorry you made the trip for nothing.

154
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,170
Now we don't know
if it's on Earth or not.

155
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:42,740
He said third planet. lt's here, you idiot.

156
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:46,610
- Third Rock from the Sun.  - l never got that till now.

157
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,980
lt's on Earth, and l know who's gonna tell me where it is.

158
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,470
- Don't you ever go home?  - Nope.

159
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,440
l see you neuralyzed another partner.

160
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,680
Bee, Dee, when you use a fission carbonizer

161
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,590
attach a de-atomizer so it doesn't sound like a cannon.

162
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,060
Hey, get some booties on them things. You're crapping up the floor.

163
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:43,870
Check his visa.

164
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,200
The Cephalopods have been making counterfeits at Kinko's on Canal.

165
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:53,640
And why do l have a dead Tricrainasloph going through passport control?

166
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,980
That'd be my fault. l'm very sorry. Please don't neuralyze me, sir.

167
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,680
- What the hell's that supposed to mean?  - Nothing, sir.

168
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:06,720
Good work in the subway.

169
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:10,830
- l remember jeff when he was yea high.  - What you got for me?

170
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,300
Look. See those guys in black suits?

171
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:16,530
- They work here. We got it covered.  - Zed, what you got?

172
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,940
Dedication's one thing, but this job will eat you up and spit you out.

173
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,080
You want to look like me when you hit 50?

174
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,400
ish?

175
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,510
l'll be in the gym if you need me.

176
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,550
All right, there was a killing earlier. 177 Spring.

177
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,020
Alien-on-alien.

178
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,660
Take Tee with you

179
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,630
Tee. Right.

180
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,430
and make a report.

181
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,630
You have got to stop neuralyzing MiB personnel.

182
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,030
He was cryingin the middle of the diner.

183
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,730
l hate that.

184
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,540
And plus, you can't count Elle.

185
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,650
She wanted to go back to the morgue. l helped her.

186
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:02,720
- You need a partner.  - l'm cool.

187
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,020
l'll be his partner.

188
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,890
jay, wait up. l appreciate the shot, man.

189
00:19:09,090 --> 00:19:11,250
- Thought l'd never get out.  - Lose the suit.

190
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,620
Sure thing. just going for the look.

191
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,490
But if l say so myself, l find it slimming.

192
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,290
Not that l've had problems with the ladies.

193
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,060
When you get down to...

194
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,960
Nice sled, very swank.

195
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,260
Heated seats? Sometimes l get hives.

196
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:48,060
Frank!

197
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,560
Bring your head in this window before l roll it up in there.

198
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,100
Got it.

199
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,540
Frank!

200
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,780
My money? lt's missionary.

201
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:08,010
l was in the Bowery, and l meet this Great Dane.

202
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,450
A little thick in the body, but pretty.

203
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:13,710
That's just not appealing to me, man. Seriously.

204
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:16,220
l say we do the good cop, bad cop thing.

205
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,880
You interrogate the witness and l growl.

206
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:23,330
How about we do the good cop, dumb dog thing, and you just shut up?

207
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,860
You got it, partner. Total silence.

208
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,370
Absolute quiet. Not a word out of me.

209
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,700
What do we got?

210
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,310
- What do we got?  - There's residue on the wall.

211
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:42,380
- We sent samples to Em for analysis.  - Hey, 0% body fat.

212
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:46,810
- Funny.  - Witness?

213
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,310
Girl. Saw everything.

214
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,490
Lorry.

215
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,060
She's taking it well.

216
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,390
l won't answer any more questions. l want to know what happened here.

217
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,860
- l'll handle this one.  - You got it.

218
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,400
Alone. A talking dog might be a bit much for her now.

219
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,630
What do you want me to do?

220
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:07,000
Sniff around.

221
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,100
What?

222
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:10,740
Funny.

223
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:13,380
Take a deep breath. Everything is all right.

224
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:16,680
What part is she supposed to feel all right about?

225
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:21,440
l'm Agent jay.

226
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,120
Tell me what you saw.

227
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:25,790
- A two-headed guy and a woman.  - Caucasian?

228
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,990
Gray, with tentacles that she used to rip...

229
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,220
His skin off.

230
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:35,700
lt's not skin. lt's protoplasma polymer similar to the gum in baseball cards.

231
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,430
- What was the last thing you ate?  - Calzone.

232
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,730
- What time?  - Lunch.

233
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:42,270
- Spinach?  - Mushroom.

234
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,700
You need pie.

235
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:49,840
They kept asking Ben about a light.

236
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,280
You okay?

237
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,790
An hour ago, a man l've known my whole life vanished

238
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,480
because of a woman with weird fingers

239
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,390
and a two-headed guy with a cannoli's lQ.

240
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,220
So yeah, everything's okay.

241
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:09,530
When we're kids, before we're taught how to think

242
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:13,040
our hearts tell us there is something else out there.

243
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:18,110
l know what l saw. Tell me what l'm supposed to believe.

244
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:28,880
l'm a member of a secret organization that monitors alien activity on Earth.

245
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,250
Ben was an alien. So were his killers.

246
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,420
l don't know why they did it, but l promise l'm gonna find out.

247
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,670
Okay.

248
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:41,590
- Okay?  - Okay.

249
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,440
Okay.

250
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,510
- l'm sorry, l'm gonna have to... - Kill me?

251
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,200
No!

252
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:58,320
just a little flash and everything goes back the way it was.

253
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:02,120
After you flash me

254
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,690
if l see you again, will l know it's you?

255
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,850
l'll see you.

256
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:11,290
But you won't see me.

257
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,520
Must be hard.

258
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,600
Must be very lonely.

259
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,390
Excuse me.

260
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:36,720
- l gotta go.  - What about the flashy thing?

261
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,520
l'll flash you some other time.

262
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,940
What?

263
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:09,990
- Did you tell the girl you love her?  - She's a witness to a crime. That's it.

264
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,250
You're attracted. She's not my species, and l'm attracted.

265
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:18,390
l should take advice on love from a dude that chases his own ass?

266
00:24:18,570 --> 00:24:22,590
Easy, pal. That's canine profiling, and l resent it.

267
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,650
Hey, jay, wait up.

268
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,820
Coming through. MiB brass. Look sharp.

269
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,960
l'm Agent Eff, jay's new partner. Who are you eyeballing?

270
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,390
Frank, just cool out, dog.

271
00:24:52,170 --> 00:24:53,720
- Got kids?  - No.

272
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,370
Want them?

273
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,540
Get him off me!

274
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,580
- Talk to me.  - lt's Kylothian, class C.

275
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:12,750
Serleena.

276
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:15,290
- Serleena. Old girlfriend?  - She wishes.

277
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:18,120
The perps were looking for the Light of...

278
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,950
- Zartha.  - Yeah, what is it?

279
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,600
This makes no sense. lt's not on Earth.

280
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,030
- We took care of this a long time ago.  - Obviously not.

281
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,230
That is very bad news.

282
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,100
The Zarthans came to Earth to hide the Light from Serleena.

283
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:35,770
- We don't do that.  - Right. l ordered it off the planet.

284
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,570
Well, Zed.

285
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,180
l got a Kylothian class C in my park. Are you sure this Light isn't here?

286
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:45,950
Positive. l gave the order. My best agent carried it out.

287
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,680
- lt's as if l gave it to you.  - Ask the agent.

288
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:49,950
- Can't.  - Dead?

289
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:53,290
Sort of. He works at the post office.

290
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,590
No.

291
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,430
If Serleena gets to kay before we do, he's dead.

292
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,630
The Earth's very existence may rest on what Kay knows.

293
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,270
Too bad you wiped out his memory of it.

294
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:05,930
Bring him in.

295
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,300
Now.

296
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,540
How cool is this? Going to get Kay. The legend, the go-to guy.

297
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,240
The guy who taught you everything.

298
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,050
- The greatest agent in MiB history!  - Frank! Stop talking.

299
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,150
Stay.

300
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,920
Listen, partner. l may look like a dog

301
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,560
but l only play one here on Earth.

302
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:32,400
- Whatever. Wipe your mouth.  - Hey, babe.

303
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:42,070
People of Truro, may l kindly have your attention?

304
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,680
To facilitate your shipping needs

305
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,510
all packages must be properly wrapped.

306
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,550
This one is an example of "go home and do it again."

307
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:54,520
l think you know what l mean, Mrs. Vigushin.

308
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,560
Brown paper and triple-twist twine are the preferred media.

309
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,460
Thank you for your time.

310
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,560
- Kay.  - C. Express mail, two-day air.

311
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,630
Kevin.

312
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,530
Kevin. That's funny. You don't have a "Kevin".

313
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,510
You don't remember. We worked together.

314
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:22,780
l never worked in a funeral home. Something l can do for you, slick?

315
00:27:22,950 --> 00:27:24,580
Straight to the point.

316
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,580
You were an agent of an organization that monitors aliens on Earth.

317
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,780
We're the Men in Black.
We have a situation. We need your help.

318
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:37,690
There is a free mental health clinic on the corner of Lilac.

319
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,830
- Next.  - Excuse me.

320
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,390
- Twenty Rugrats stamps.  - Elizabeth.

321
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:46,870
The Postal Service hasn't kept up with today's youth, but we have

322
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,700
Berlin airlift stamps. Opera legends?

323
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,850
American Samoa? Amish quilts.

324
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,740
l'm sorry, got a world to save here.

325
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,140
There was no coma.
lt was a cover.

326
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,120
- Who are you?  - Who are you?

327
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:05,590
The postmaster of Truro, Massachusetts, and l'm ordering you to leave.

328
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,960
- ls that decaf?  - Sorry.

329
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:12,500
We have a breach. Cordon off this area.

330
00:28:12,670 --> 00:28:15,660
Full perimeter wipe-down, right here, right now.

331
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:20,240
Get a mop and escort all civilian personnel from this site immediately.

332
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:23,570
Listen to yourself, Kay. Who talks like that?

333
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:22,430
Why do you think you're so comfortable here?

334
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,840
just about everybody who works in a post office is an alien.

335
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,540
No smoking.

336
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,590
Kay.

337
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,520
My wife and l saw Siegfried and Roy fly a tiger around a room.

338
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,190
You're nothing special.

339
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,270
When you look at the stars, you get a feeling

340
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,430
like you don't know who you are.

341
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:02,240
Like you know more about out there than you do down here.

342
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,010
That's why she left you, Kay. That's why your wife left you.

343
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,850
Okay, l'll tell you what.

344
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,950
You want to know who you really are, take a ride with me.

345
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,960
lf not, people are waiting for their TV Guides.

346
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,620
Think he'll bite?

347
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,270
l'm just going for a ride. lf things don't add up, it's hasta luego.

348
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,000
Hey, Kay.

349
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,610
How's it hanging?

350
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:54,760
Good to see you, Kay.

351
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:57,990
Good to see you too, whoever you are.

352
00:30:59,370 --> 00:31:03,560
Well, let's see what you got here, chief.

353
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,310
Welcome back, Agent Kay.

354
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,850
Agent Kay.

355
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:21,580
Greetings, Kay.

356
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,050
Wow, look who's back.

357
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,790
- l don't mean to bother you  - You're Agent Kay!

358
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:31,120
- That's what they tell me.  - This is an honor. Agent Gee.

359
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,770
The most respected agent in MiB history.

360
00:31:33,930 --> 00:31:36,430
The most feared human in the universe.

361
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,570
Maybe l could buy you a cup of coffee?

362
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,400
- Black, two sugars, if you're going.  - An honor.

363
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,940
-Yeah, l'll take a... My man?  - Good to see you, Kay.

364
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,010
How'd it go?

365
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,650
The Drolacks are gone and the treaty is signed.

366
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:52,820
Good work.

367
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:56,350
What about that position you promised me in Men in Black?

368
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:59,920
Still working on the alien affirmative action program.

369
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,360
That's not what you promised me.

370
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,620
- You're breaking up.  - Zed? Hello?

371
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,390
- l'll call you back.  - I could be Agent Em. Zed, you...

372
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:13,900
l think Earth might be in a bad way. You're the only one that could save it.

373
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,170
- Well, neither rain, sleet, snow....  - Good man.

374
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:21,250
Get him armed and up to speed and over to deneuralyzation.

375
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,540
- Frank  - Yeah?

376
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:26,720
l'm gonna need them together on this one.

377
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,780
l need an assistant. lt's not field work, but you get dental.

378
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,460
Dental?

379
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:41,870
The most advanced technologies from all over the universe are in this room.

380
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:45,070
All is lost! All is lost!

381
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:47,700
Don't touch that!

382
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,540
l didn't do anything.

383
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:53,870
Hands in your pockets.

384
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,450
Your favorite weapon.

385
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:10,490
- That?  - Yep.

386
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,090
- Let's go put it on.  - What?

387
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:15,600
The last suit you'll ever wear.

388
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,330
Again.

389
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,780
The deneuralyzer.

390
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:30,410
Magneto-energy will surge through your brain

391
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:35,180
unlocking information that could hold the key to Earth's very survival.

392
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,020
Okay. What's that thing?

393
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,420
The deneuralyzer.

394
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:52,900
Welcome to planet Earth. There are some rules and regulations.

395
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,470
Go out only at night.

396
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,870
lf you must go out during the daylight, only the East Village.

397
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,840
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

398
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,990
Name and planet of origin?

399
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:15,890
Sylona Gorth. Planet jorn. Kaluth system.

400
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:20,920
- Any fruits or vegetables?  - Yeah, two heads of cabbage.

401
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,090
Reason for visit?

402
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:25,800
Education. l want to learn how to be an underwear model.

403
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,700
They told me l've got real potential.

404
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,040
Help! Heart attack!

405
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,710
Clear!

406
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,980
Wake up, champ!

407
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:47,650
- Oh, jeez.  - Lockdown. Code 1 0 1.

408
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,560
Lockdown.

409
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,090
This is not good. This is not good.

410
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,770
- Breach! We're being flushed.  - Flushed?

411
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,470
- Ever been to a water park?  - l don't know.

412
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,650
Flushed.

413
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:48,250
Yeah, man, back when you was an agent, you loved getting flushed.

414
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,020
Yeah, every Saturday night, you'd be like, "Flush me, jay. Flush me."

415
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:54,920
l'd be like, "No."

416
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,050
You can't quit on me.

417
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:01,130
l save the world, you tell me why l stare at the stars.

418
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,860
Cool.

419
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:08,870
- Hop in.  - Hop in what?

420
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,540
Does that come standard?

421
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,850
lt came with a black dude, but he kept getting pulled over.

422
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:26,260
l could rule this place with the right set of mammary glands.

423
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,180
Trapped like rats

424
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:29,990
in a Chia Pet.

425
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:32,760
Computer, surveillance MiB.

426
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,370
MiB's locked down.

427
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,070
Computer, magnify. Times 1 0.

428
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,110
Communicator. Frank.

429
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,710
- jay, where are you?  - We got flushed.

430
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,040
- MiB's code 1 0 1.  - Yeah, who did it?

431
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,220
Some hot-looking biker chick. Want me to tail her?

432
00:36:56,390 --> 00:37:01,230
- Stay where you are. l'll be in touch.  - Stay where l am. Easy for you to say.

433
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,790
- Have you Find Kay?  - Neuralyzed.

434
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,590
- Not active. Civilian.  - What?

435
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:06,790
But he was here

436
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:08,300
- To get  - Deneuralyzed?

437
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:13,000
- Memory's shot. But we'll find him.  - Don't put anything in our ears.

438
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:14,960
What?

439
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:18,600
What do you make of that? Found it in my pocket. Weird, huh?

440
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,510
- Yeah, a smile.  - ls that the only deneuralyzer?

441
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,620
Officially. The plans leaked out on the lnternet.

442
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,790
Computer, lnternet.

443
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:28,820
Deneuralyzer.

444
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,830
Perfect. lt's an old friend.

445
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,630
jay, ain't seen you in a while.

446
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,540
Did you peep that drop-top thing out front?

447
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,830
My business is banging, dog.

448
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:53,710
You gotta check out the website. lt's jeebsie dot..

449
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:55,970
Okay, whoa. He's retired, right?

450
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,180
We need the deneuralyzer.

451
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,720
- You're kidding.  - The meter's running, jeebs.

452
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:06,320
Do you remember me?

453
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,950
Can't say l do. l'm good with faces.

454
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,260
l think l'd remember that.

455
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,530
The great Kay's a neutral.

456
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:19,000
You're between me and my memories. Do you have this deneuralyzer or not?

457
00:38:19,170 --> 00:38:20,500
No.

458
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,130
Fresh out.

459
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,040
Can't help you.

460
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,640
Don't got it.

461
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,230
Even if l did, if it doesn't work, he dies, you blow my head off.

462
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,420
lf it does, l've brought back Kay, who, for fun, blows my head off.

463
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,500
So, what's my incentive?

464
00:38:48,870 --> 00:38:53,000
Okay, homey, l keep it downstairs next to the snow blowers.

465
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:59,740
Alien prisoners released, armed and ready for your orders.

466
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,350
Prisoners of MiB, the scum of the universe.

467
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,380
Now it's the scum's turn.

468
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,020
l'm in a jam, so l'll make this simple.

469
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,860
l need the Light of Zartha, and Kay knows where it is.

470
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,360
Whoever brings Kay to me gets Earth.

471
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:17,830
Find a deneuralyzer. They want his memory back.

472
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,830
Check.

473
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,020
Now.

474
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,410
jarra, good to see you.

475
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,280
Okay, that should do it.

476
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:37,820
lf l could have your attention while we go over the safety procedures.

477
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:40,510
Keep your hands inside the vehicle.

478
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:43,750
lf, during the ride, you become disoriented...

479
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,620
there's nothing we can do about it.

480
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,530
Have you removed all your jewelry?

481
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,530
- Are you allergic to shellfish?  - jeebs!

482
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:57,500
Right, then! Smoke 'em if you got 'em.

483
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,480
Have you used this?

484
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,450
l used it to make some hot-air popcorn. That's about it.

485
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,550
Okay! Let's make it happen, cap'n!

486
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,170
Perfect.

487
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:24,880
- You're back.  - No.

488
00:41:25,090 --> 00:41:28,290
- How'd you know his head grows back?  - lt grows back?

489
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,700
Real nice. Okay, that's the last time l help out a friend.

490
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,660
- Kay, you remember anything?  - Goodbye.

491
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,400
- Kay!  - Kay, wait!

492
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:45,770
l never got the updated software. Still working off the 6.0.

493
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,880
Your brain needs to reboot.

494
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,450
Give it a minute.

495
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:52,020
Kay!

496
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:57,520
Bottom of my heart, l'm really sorry. l hope it won't affect our friendship.

497
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:02,250
All those years of loyalty and trust, respect for one another.

498
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,000
Right over there!

499
00:42:07,530 --> 00:42:10,000
- Where's Kay?  - He's not here! He went--

500
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,540
Kay's retired. l'm his trigger-happy replacement.

501
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:17,270
Right in the pie hole. Now nothing's gonna taste right.

502
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,910
- Lower your weapon.  - No.

503
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,940
jay, how are you, boo-boo?

504
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,750
- These guys really need Kay.  - He's a neutral.

505
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,620
- Tell me something we don't know.  - Yeah, tell me something

506
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,390
l am so sorry.

507
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,550
- God bless you.  - Thank you.

508
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,860
lf l don't bring Kay back to MiB, Serleena's gonna kick my ass.

509
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,100
- Now, where is he?  - Where is who?

510
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:48,830
-Now, where is he?
-Where is who?

511
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,440
You don't look too good. Yeah, and you look like crap.

512
00:42:54,250 --> 00:42:57,110
l take that back. He look like crap.

513
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,650
- Bend him!  - Bend him.

514
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,690
Wait, don't bend him.

515
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,230
Damn decent of you.

516
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,090
Don't mention it.

517
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,750
- l'm gonna be sick.  - You don't wanna do that.

518
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,910
- Fellas, l think he's telling the truth.  - Then he's no good to us.

519
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,290
- Didn't l teach you anything, kid?  - Pineal eye!

520
00:44:20,870 --> 00:44:22,560
Go for the mosh tendrils!

521
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,540
Kay, he's a ball-chinnian.

522
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:35,570
- You were in a tight spot.  - l handled it.

523
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:38,550
- You need a partner.  - l had one. job got too tough.

524
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:41,050
l'm back. You got some dust on your coat.

525
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,120
So you got your memory back.

526
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,720
- What the hell is going on?  - Don't know.

527
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,360
- The Light of Zartha?  - Never heard of it.

528
00:44:48,530 --> 00:44:49,550
Cool.

529
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,230
You don't remember the Light of Zartha?

530
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,100
Must've neuralyzed myself to keep it from myself.

531
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:01,540
- Good plan. What you doing?  - l do the driving.

532
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,700
- Wait, no. Whoa.  - l remember that.

533
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:07,810
What you remember is you used to drive that old, busted jawn.

534
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:11,040
l drive the new hotness.

535
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,850
Old and busted, new hotness.

536
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,890
Old busted hotness.

537
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:28,960
- Serleena, please.  - Been a long time, Zed.

538
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,760
l'm just touched you remembered me. Makes me fuzzy all over.

539
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:36,270
Never forget a pretty
whatever you are.

540
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:40,210
Zed?

541
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,240
Zed? Look at you.

542
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,410
Twenty-five years,
and you're still such a looker.

543
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,310
Cut out the meat and dairy.

544
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,290
And you, still a pile of squirmy crap in a different wrapper.

545
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,290
So feisty. Look, we both need the same thing.

546
00:45:58,200 --> 00:45:59,720
Bring him in.

547
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:01,490
Don't think so.

548
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,630
What about the Light's secret? lf it's not off Earth by midnight

549
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,240
it self-destructs, annihilating your little planet.

550
00:46:09,410 --> 00:46:13,280
l lose, you lose. l win, everything keeps spinning.

551
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:17,640
You don't want the Light on Earth any more than l do.

552
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:21,950
All right, Serleena.

553
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,090
You win.

554
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:30,030
Zed? Is that you? I could be Agent Em.

555
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,830
Zed. Hello?

556
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,400
So feisty.

557
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,540
Fastest way back to MiB, you take this right on 39th.

558
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,280
Right here. Right.

559
00:46:56,490 --> 00:46:58,220
Next right on 37th.

560
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,860
Right here. Right!

561
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:02,750
We're not going back.

562
00:47:02,930 --> 00:47:07,990
Headquarters has been breached, man. We need to peel caps and split wigs.

563
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:09,790
Not ready.

564
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,690
Look, you've been out for five years. That's a long time.

565
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:16,970
l understand you're scared. l'm a little scared too.

566
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:19,200
- l'm not scared.  - Me neither.

567
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:22,180
l just thought we was bonding.

568
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,110
You're acting like a rookie. Splitting wigs and stepping on caps.

569
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:31,350
- No wonder Zed brought me back.  - He did it because you messed up.

570
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,250
Your attitude makes for a stressful environment.

571
00:47:34,430 --> 00:47:38,490
Tell it to the hand. Stressful is what we got back at MiB.

572
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:43,260
Exactly. Serleena broke into MiB in order to lure me back.

573
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,500
lnto a trap.

574
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:48,230
Which is why we can't bust in there.

575
00:47:48,410 --> 00:47:51,400
We need a plan. Where we going? Scene of the crime?

576
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,780
- You're the boss.  - Scene of the crime. That's a left.

577
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,740
l'll contact the witness. We'll talk to her.

578
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:04,150
Things have changed. We used to neuralyze witnesses.

579
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:07,220
See, originally, l'd...

580
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:12,720
No, l was going to... l interrogated her.

581
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:14,560
- Then neuralyzed her?  - What?

582
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:20,140
MiB code 7 73ll-1 clearly states that all civilian personnel...

583
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,630
- Drop that weapon!  - No!

584
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:24,400
jay, l'm... l'm sorry.

585
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,510
No, no, l'm fine. lt's my fault.

586
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,320
Kay, my partner. Laura, the witness.

587
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:31,610
Pleasure.

588
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:37,450
Thanks for sending those agents over to keep an eye on me last night.

589
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,630
MiB procedural code 594-B

590
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,990
states that MiB personnel shall never be used

591
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:48,500
Ben, the Zarthan, was vaporized here. l assume the perp was over here.

592
00:48:48,670 --> 00:48:50,230
Ben.

593
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:53,240
- Was he 5'7", thinning hair?  - You knew him?

594
00:48:53,670 --> 00:48:55,900
Nope. Never seen him before in my life.

595
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,980
That is a hell of a fish.

596
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:02,980
Wait a minute.

597
00:49:08,150 --> 00:49:09,550
You left yourself clues?

598
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,720
ln case l was deneuralyzed because my replacement couldn't handle it.

599
00:49:13,930 --> 00:49:18,590
lf the joker that had got deneuralyzed hadn't created the situation

600
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,100
Boys.

601
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:24,900
All right. You pointing at something.

602
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,440
Excuse me.

603
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,570
The astronaut.

604
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,340
jay?

605
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,110
Okay, all right. He's pointing...

606
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,290
He's like...

607
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:45,820
Who would stack boxes like this?

608
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:49,830
A box stacker who's not stacking boxes. He's leaving clues.

609
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,490
lt's an arrow.

610
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,900
- jay?  - You're slowing me down, slick.

611
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:01,700
Whatever we're looking for is in these cabinets, right here.

612
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:06,170
Anchovy filets in virgin olive oil.

613
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,080
l hope l'm not slowing you down.

614
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,310
Good work, partner. Yeah.

615
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:18,420
- We gotta figure out where it goes.  - l know where.

616
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,850
- No. Not yet.  - MIB code 7 73 clearly says

617
00:50:23,030 --> 00:50:26,230
l know the code, but she might be important to me.

618
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:29,320
To us. Well, for help. To help us later.

619
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,700
Well, she can't stay here. They'll be back.

620
00:50:35,410 --> 00:50:39,110
- You can stay with friends of mine.  - People like you?

621
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:40,400
Kind of.

622
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,140
jay!

623
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,810
- Low bridge!  - What's going on, man?

624
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,250
Hey, what's happening, fellas? MiB is code 1 01 .

625
00:50:48,890 --> 00:50:50,220
- Bad.  - Very bad.

626
00:50:50,390 --> 00:50:54,420
- l need your help. This is Laura.  - Laura!

627
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,290
Easy, easy!

628
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,450
They're worms.

629
00:50:57,630 --> 00:51:00,930
Once you go worm, that's what you'll yearn.

630
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:04,430
- That's what they say. They just:  - l've dated worse.

631
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:07,570
They're suspended for stealing from duty-free.

632
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:10,540
- We were framed.  - Zed's wormophobic.

633
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:12,010
- Kay!  - You're back!

634
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:14,910
- They said you were dead.  - We're double-parked.

635
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,980
Laura's very important to me.

636
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:21,280
To us. To the stuff, Me and you, the stuff we're doing.

637
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,390
- Keep an eye on her.  - l'll keep both on her.

638
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,560
No problem!

639
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,590
- Why don't you sit here?  - Like you got a shot.

640
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:32,920
Hey, shut up!

641
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:38,800
My communicator, in case you need it.

642
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,070
- Nice move.  - Okay.

643
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:50,510
- just watch out for Neeble.  - Which one's Neeble?

644
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,180
- Which one of y'all is Neeble?  - Yo, mama!

645
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:59,550
Him, right there. lt's fine. Everything's straight. lt's safe.

646
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,690
Don't fall asleep.

647
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,120
Twister!

648
00:52:07,130 --> 00:52:11,800
Run over your plan one more time. l'm struggling with it.

649
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:15,870
You neuralyzed memory of the Light but left yourself clues.

650
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:17,030
Right.

651
00:52:17,210 --> 00:52:22,270
Photo pointing to a key in a pizzeria which opens a locker at Grand Central.

652
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:26,510
- ln the locker, we'll find another clue.  - That's the plan.

653
00:52:28,990 --> 00:52:32,520
- l like to keep my enemies confused.  - We're all confused.

654
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:39,160
- Are you gonna slow me down?  - Your brain's working on old software.

655
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,560
Why don't you go grab us some coffee?

656
00:52:41,730 --> 00:52:45,230
Sure. How do you take it? Black? Couple cubes of kiss my ass?

657
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,810
l don't know what's in there, so step back.

658
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,430
Kay, for real, man. Open the damn locker.

659
00:52:57,020 --> 00:52:59,420
Kay!
He's back! The light giver!

660
00:52:59,620 --> 00:53:02,090
All hail Kay! All hail Kay!

661
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:06,320
Oh, kay, can you see By the dawn's early light

662
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,360
You are the man who would be king of the train locker.

663
00:53:09,530 --> 00:53:10,500
Praise Kay!

664
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:15,500
Oh, good and gentle townsfolk of Locker C-1 8

665
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:19,230
- did l leave anything here?  - Yes. The timekeeper.

666
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,070
Left to illuminate our streets and hearts.

667
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:26,700
- l've been looking everywhere for this.  - Merciful one! The clock tower!

668
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:29,610
l got y'all, it's cool. Check this out.

669
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:33,010
Titanium case. Waterproof to over 300 meters.

670
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,340
- That's banging.  - Who are you, stranger?

671
00:53:36,790 --> 00:53:38,350
Jay.

672
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:41,020
jay!

673
00:53:41,460 --> 00:53:43,490
All hail jay! All hail jay!

674
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:46,720
- Oh, merciful jay, the keeper of  - Come on.

675
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:49,430
- Wait! The commandments!  - The tablet!

676
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:52,630
The tablet! The tablet! The tablet! The tablet!

677
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:56,830
We have lived by its word, and peace has reigned throughout our world.

678
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:00,410
Pass it on to others! So that they too may be enlightened!

679
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,240
Be kind! Rewind!

680
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,250
Reconcile your past...

681
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,080
in order to move into your future!

682
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:09,650
Two for one every Wednesday.

683
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:13,160
Give twice as much as ye receive on our most sacred of days.

684
00:54:13,430 --> 00:54:14,450
Every Wednesday.

685
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:18,460
Large adult entertainment section in the back.

686
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,430
That's just nasty.

687
00:54:24,270 --> 00:54:26,530
- What's with the video card?  - Don't know.

688
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,200
- The watch?  - A reminder.

689
00:54:28,370 --> 00:54:29,770
- Of what?  - Can't remember.

690
00:54:29,940 --> 00:54:30,930
Guess.

691
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:34,880
l guess we have till midnight. 59 minutes to figure it out.

692
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:41,410
Look. Here's an idea. Let's stop chasing butt-backwards clues

693
00:54:41,620 --> 00:54:45,750
get a couple fission carbonizers and get our headquarters back.

694
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,090
lt's all about to make sense, kid.

695
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:50,020
ls this card valid?

696
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,500
- This card hasn't been used in years.  - l've been away on business.

697
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:58,000
- Billions of frequent flier miles.  - Try and use them.

698
00:54:58,170 --> 00:55:02,200
l wanted to go to Cambodia. You can get a lobster dinner for a dollar.

699
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:07,910
The airlines black out holidays. lt's a conspiracy, l'm sure, l mean

700
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,780
Can you tell us anything about the account?

701
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:13,120
You never checked out a tape.

702
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:16,650
You reserved one once, but you never picked it up.

703
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,590
- Newton.  - There's a rat in the toilet.

704
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:24,020
lt's all stopped up. You're gonna have to pee in the sin

705
00:55:27,230 --> 00:55:30,200
- Still think l'm paranoid?  - Yeah.

706
00:55:30,970 --> 00:55:36,430
Gentlemen, my name is Newton. l run the place. Seen any aliens lately?

707
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:40,840
- You need professional help.  - He's getting it. lt's not working.

708
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,240
Okay, so, new case, huh?

709
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,850
Episode 27, Light of Zartha.

710
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,680
Got it.

711
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,090
jarra, it's a sin they've kept a genius like you locked away.

712
00:55:53,260 --> 00:55:57,220
Their agent jay caught me siphoning ozone to sell on the black market.

713
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,330
They're touchy about global warming.

714
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:03,060
l need a spacecraft that can travel 300 times the speed of light.

715
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,200
l'll give you whatever you want.

716
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:07,900
- Give me jay. We'll call it even.  - Groovy.

717
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:11,140
You've got till midnight.

718
00:56:15,310 --> 00:56:18,910
Gatbot, l got a little something special for you.

719
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:26,190
Newton? Newton, is that you?

720
00:56:26,360 --> 00:56:28,830
Yes, Mom, l'm up here with some friends.

721
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:30,620
l wanna have your baby.

722
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,890
Would you like some mini-pizza?

723
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,930
You guys want some mini-pizzas? They're good.

724
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:40,300
They're like mini-bagels, with pizza stuff on them.

725
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:43,270
She'll put a little fontina cheese on.

726
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:47,400
She has palsy, so she ends up putting a lot of cheese on.

727
00:56:52,050 --> 00:56:54,180
No, thanks, we're cool.

728
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:55,610
All right.

729
00:56:57,360 --> 00:56:58,720
Over here.

730
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,730
This is it.

731
00:57:05,030 --> 00:57:07,330
Finally some hard evidence.

732
00:57:07,570 --> 00:57:11,260
Gentlemen, before l play the tape, one question:

733
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,630
What's up with anal probing?

734
00:57:13,810 --> 00:57:17,710
Aliens travel billions of light years just to check out our

735
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:20,140
Boy, move.

736
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:23,210
Okay. just a question.

737
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:27,810
Here is one of their stories that "never happened"

738
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:31,850
from one of their files that doesn't exist.

739
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:38,250
1978. Devastating war of Zartha had raged on for 50 years.

740
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,190
Looks like Spielberg's work.

741
00:57:40,370 --> 00:57:44,270
But the Zarthans had a great treasure, the Light of Zartha.

742
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:47,800
A source of power so awesome, it alone

743
00:57:47,970 --> 00:57:51,570
could mean victory and restoration for the Zarthans

744
00:57:51,740 --> 00:57:56,180
or complete annihilation, if it fell into the hands of the kylothians.

745
00:57:56,350 --> 00:58:00,440
A group of Zarthans made the journey, led by the keeper of the Light

746
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,120
Lauranna.

747
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:04,580
Princess Lauranna.

748
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:09,490
Lauranna beseeched the Men in Black to help her hide the Light on Earth.

749
00:58:09,660 --> 00:58:12,030
But they could not intervene.

750
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:13,430
No.

751
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:15,260
lt was night.

752
00:58:17,470 --> 00:58:18,900
And it was raining.

753
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,970
You've been very wise.

754
00:58:21,140 --> 00:58:25,700
kay, please. If Serleena takes the Light, it's the end of our world.

755
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,680
If we extend protection for the Light beyond Earth

756
00:58:29,850 --> 00:58:33,180
we put Earth in jeopardy. We must remain neutral.

757
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,940
- Where is it?  - We're neutral, remember?

758
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:38,320
lf you want it, go get it.

759
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:44,080
No!

760
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,520
And so never knowing it happened

761
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:18,630
the people of Earth were once again saved

762
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:21,930
by a secret society of protectors

763
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,700
l shouldn't have.

764
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:28,110
You never sent it off the planet.

765
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:30,640
You hid it here.

766
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,040
The worm guys.

767
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:41,020
Are you one of Newton's friends from therapy?

768
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:45,660
- Yes, ma'am, l am. Look here, please.  - Would you like some mini-pizz--?

769
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,320
A neuralyz

770
00:59:49,360 --> 00:59:52,920
Okay, first, get some contact lenses.

771
00:59:53,100 --> 00:59:55,400
joints look like they pick up cable.

772
00:59:55,570 --> 01:00:00,160
Second, take her to Cambodia. Get her lobster. Pay more than a dollar.

773
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:03,640
Third, the second y'all get back from Cambodia

774
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,840
move your bum ass out of your mom's house.

775
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:09,410
- Let's go.  - Boy, you like 40 years old.

776
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:11,880
- Agent jay?  - All right, all right.

777
01:00:12,050 --> 01:00:16,040
And there ain't no such thing as aliens or Men in Black.

778
01:00:22,260 --> 01:00:25,460
- You wanna go to Cambodia?  - Yeah.

779
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,000
Hey, Mom?

780
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:31,690
Communicator, jay.

781
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:35,370
- Laura, it's me.  - jay, we're playing Twister.

782
01:00:35,540 --> 01:00:37,340
What's up, jay?

783
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:40,770
- Quit touching my butt!  - l thought it was your face.

784
01:00:40,950 --> 01:00:43,970
They're good at this.  They don't have spines.

785
01:00:44,150 --> 01:00:47,140
They were telling me about Oprah, from Chicago.

786
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:50,480
Maybe landed in Chicago.

787
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:53,650
- Are you wearing a bracelet?  - Yeah.

788
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:54,880
ls it glowing?

789
01:01:00,030 --> 01:01:03,020
- lt's never done that before.  - We're on our way.

790
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,570
Deactivate the lockdown. We're headed to the worm guys. We found the Light.

791
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:13,470
Got it, jay. Scrad?

792
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,770
Bitch.

793
01:01:14,950 --> 01:01:16,850
Why didn't you say l love you?

794
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,650
- He's a dog. l don't even like him.  - No, the girl. You're sweet on her.

795
01:01:21,850 --> 01:01:24,950
That's why you didn't neuralyze her. You got emotionally involved.

796
01:01:25,160 --> 01:01:29,620
- Like you did with Lauranna?  - l put the entire planet in danger.

797
01:01:29,830 --> 01:01:33,090
l don't want to see you making my mistakes.

798
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,820
Whatever, man.

799
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,430
Laura?

800
01:01:47,410 --> 01:01:48,440
Damn!

801
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,850
Never stood half a chance.

802
01:01:56,090 --> 01:01:57,110
Oh, boy.

803
01:01:58,260 --> 01:02:00,280
That's gonna leave a scar.

804
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,520
- Where's Laura?  - MiB headquarters.

805
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,820
- Some dumb two-headed guy.  - They got the bracelet.

806
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,760
We got 39 minutes. You guys...

807
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,100
pull yourselves together.

808
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:13,900
Damn.

809
01:02:15,310 --> 01:02:17,370
That's feeling better.

810
01:02:17,540 --> 01:02:20,270
- Hey, guys, wait up!  - Let me grab my drink!

811
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:22,470
Serleena has the bracelet. Why take Laura?

812
01:02:22,650 --> 01:02:23,810
She also wants me.

813
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,280
- What's the book say?  - We're off book. l say split some wigs.

814
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:29,680
- We need wig-splitting weapons.  - Got them.

815
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:45,160
Don't worry, folks. l used to live here. Came to pick up a few things.

816
01:02:50,540 --> 01:02:52,130
Nice place.

817
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,280
See you.

818
01:03:15,130 --> 01:03:17,930
You did not see a room full of weapons or four aliens.

819
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,830
You will cherish and love each other for the rest of your lives.

820
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:24,970
Which could be the next 28 minutes, so get to loving and cherishing.

821
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:27,810
And she can stay up as late as she want

822
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:30,610
and have cookies and candy and stuff.

823
01:03:41,490 --> 01:03:45,800
Four minutes to launch.

824
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:50,530
- Your ship is ready.  - Good. Send it to Kyloth now.

825
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,130
Ready, guys?

826
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:57,500
Lock and load, baby.

827
01:03:57,680 --> 01:03:59,340
- You ready, kid?  - Kid?

828
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:02,540
l saved the world from a Kreelon invasion.

829
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:06,880
They're the Backstreet Boys of the universe. They throw snowballs?

830
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:09,150
Know what you're doing?

831
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:12,260
l'm about to attack one of the most feared aliens

832
01:04:12,460 --> 01:04:15,720
with four worms and a mailman. Let's make it hot.

833
01:04:15,890 --> 01:04:17,160
No, no, wait!

834
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:25,230
A code 1 01 lockdown!

835
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:29,430
The building gets pressurized. Nothing in, nothing out. l knew that.

836
01:04:29,610 --> 01:04:31,630
Yeah, you knew. Front and center, worms!

837
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:33,110
You got it.

838
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:45,220
lt's about time you guys got here. That lady is causing all kinds of hell.

839
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:08,840
Yummy. Someone l need to eat.

840
01:05:09,050 --> 01:05:12,980
Get to the launch pad. The bracelet shows the departure point.

841
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:15,150
- Do not come back for me.  - What?

842
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,980
Do not come back for me.

843
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:26,360
- Worm guys, give me some cover fire.  - Too scared, can't move.

844
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:37,240
Go!

845
01:05:47,990 --> 01:05:50,890
- Limber.  - Go to subcontrol panel 7-R-Delta.

846
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:56,520
- Shut off power so they can't take off.  - Can't. Too scared.

847
01:05:57,530 --> 01:06:00,120
- That way.  - Away from the bullets.

848
01:06:00,300 --> 01:06:01,930
No problem.

849
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:18,480
Nice to see you again, Kay.

850
01:06:22,790 --> 01:06:24,760
- Three minutes to launch.  - jay!

851
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:27,150
Three minutes to launch.

852
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:29,130
Hello, jay. Long time.

853
01:06:29,290 --> 01:06:31,790
jarra! What's up, man? You look great.

854
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:34,590
- What's it been? Five years?  - And 42 days.

855
01:06:34,770 --> 01:06:37,140
You count every one when you're locked away.

856
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:42,040
You shouldn't have tried to steal our ozone. Be there in one minute.

857
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,240
Over our dead titanium bodies!

858
01:06:45,410 --> 01:06:46,880
Two minutes.

859
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,350
Let's play this one by ear.

860
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:02,390
- l should have vaporized you before.  - You really did love Lauranna.

861
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,430
Didn't you, Kay?

862
01:07:04,730 --> 01:07:06,750
You silly little man.

863
01:07:34,990 --> 01:07:37,050
Two minutes to launch.

864
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,430
just go, l'll be fine!

865
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:43,720
What you talking about? l'm winning.

866
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:47,930
jarra, you are under arrest for being that ugly

867
01:07:48,110 --> 01:07:50,900
and for making that many copies. Surrender!

868
01:07:51,110 --> 01:07:52,970
l want him in pieces.

869
01:08:13,100 --> 01:08:15,690
- Rectum.  - Damn near killed him!

870
01:08:15,870 --> 01:08:17,630
Never get tired of that one.

871
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:20,430
- Where do we shut off the power?  - Don't know.

872
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:30,380
- l'm fine. l'll be there in a minute.  - No, he won't.

873
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,680
Down to one now, jarra!

874
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,570
Thirty seconds to launch.

875
01:08:58,680 --> 01:09:01,040
Fifteen seconds to launch.

876
01:09:03,950 --> 01:09:06,080
Ten seconds to launch.

877
01:09:06,420 --> 01:09:07,610
Eight.

878
01:09:07,820 --> 01:09:09,120
Seven.

879
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,690
Six.

880
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:12,150
Five.

881
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:13,420
Four.

882
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:14,720
Three.

883
01:09:14,930 --> 01:09:16,020
Two.

884
01:09:17,530 --> 01:09:19,460
Launch terminated.

885
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:23,390
- What did you mean, leave you?  - Well, he took your gun.

886
01:09:23,570 --> 01:09:26,400
Cracked your head. Slammed you across the room.

887
01:09:26,570 --> 01:09:30,630
- Half the time you were on your back.  - Look, that's how l fight.

888
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,810
You've lost, you insignificant speck.

889
01:09:33,980 --> 01:09:37,040
You've wasted 25 years of my time, and for what?

890
01:09:37,280 --> 01:09:41,310
The total annihilation of Zartha. All because you went mushy.

891
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:45,720
l'll give you one last chance to surrender, you slimy invertebrate.

892
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,450
- What are you gonna do to stop me?  - Not me. Him.

893
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:53,790
Your flight's been canceled.

894
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:04,940
Shut down power. Shut down power. Buttons, buttons. l'm guessing

895
01:10:05,110 --> 01:10:06,240
Yeah.

896
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:10,580
- Worms!  - Sorry.

897
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:18,280
- Give me the bracelet.  - l'm going with you.

898
01:10:18,490 --> 01:10:21,190
Everybody in the car. Everybody.

899
01:10:34,370 --> 01:10:37,240
This bracelet is what everybody's been after?

900
01:10:37,410 --> 01:10:39,140
lt's often something small.

901
01:10:39,310 --> 01:10:42,970
lt's not the Light. lt tells us the departure point.

902
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:45,340
lf we don't get there in 1 1 minutes

903
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:48,580
that bracelet will go nuclear and destroy Earth.

904
01:10:48,790 --> 01:10:50,220
What?!

905
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,820
Hello.

906
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,380
- Wait.  - l know what l'm doing.

907
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:10,860
Damn.

908
01:11:12,580 --> 01:11:15,770
- Modified to hyper-speed!  - Seat belts.

909
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:20,210
What's that?

910
01:11:20,420 --> 01:11:23,790
At hyper-speed, you have to use the navigational stalk.

911
01:11:28,060 --> 01:11:33,120
Toggle switches for the ailerons. joysticks for the stabilizer and rudder.

912
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,370
l just want you to know

913
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,660
Hold on to that for one second.

914
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,900
Computer, worms.

915
01:11:47,080 --> 01:11:52,070
l said, "Bitch, if you don't want me to kick your skinny Zone Diet ass...

916
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:56,120
- turn around and exit the planet."  - Frank, where are you?

917
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:57,750
Main hall, egg display.

918
01:11:57,920 --> 01:12:00,790
We're taking fire. Kay pushed the red button.

919
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:04,860
Computer at MiB can destroy bogey. l'll walk you through it.

920
01:12:07,100 --> 01:12:11,760
jay? Frank. You were the best darn partner a Remoolian could ever have.

921
01:12:12,570 --> 01:12:13,830
Godspeed.

922
01:12:15,310 --> 01:12:16,330
Frank? Frank?

923
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:20,000
Okay, here we go, automatic pilot.

924
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:26,440
- lt is not automatic piloting.  - He doesn't operate at hyper-speed.

925
01:12:26,650 --> 01:12:30,050
-l could use a steering wheel!
-This is what we got.

926
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,760
- Didn't you ever have a Game Boy?  - What's that?

927
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:36,420
You know what? Move.

928
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,130
That is not the navigational stalk!

929
01:12:52,110 --> 01:12:54,100
Okay, straight down.

930
01:12:58,820 --> 01:13:00,220
ldiots.

931
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,090
Subway may not be the best place to lose her.

932
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:16,930
- Where is he?  - He?

933
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,630
jeff. Hang on!

934
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:21,930
Oops.

935
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,270
Teeth.

936
01:13:58,210 --> 01:14:01,200
Running out of time, Kay. Where is the Light?

937
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:03,900
Right here.

938
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:07,150
- What?  - What, l'm the Light?

939
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:10,610
-No. No way.
-You have a planet to save.

940
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:13,290
You're mistaken. l work at a pizzeria.

941
01:14:13,460 --> 01:14:17,390
Two days ago, l was running a post office. You are who you are.

942
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,690
Laura, you are the Light.

943
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:24,600
The leader of your people. Their spirit and their hope.

944
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:27,470
The power is within you to save a planet.

945
01:14:27,640 --> 01:14:32,580
l protected you until it was your time. Your time is now.

946
01:14:36,410 --> 01:14:40,180
You will save a world. You know things before they happen.

947
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,440
- l'm a Libra.  - You're Zarthan.

948
01:14:42,650 --> 01:14:46,850
- When you get sad, it rains.  - Lots of people get sad when it rains.

949
01:14:47,160 --> 01:14:49,850
lt rains because you're sad, baby.

950
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,670
lt's not fair.

951
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:52,180
Never is.

952
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,620
We are who we are

953
01:15:55,790 --> 01:15:58,280
even if we sometimes forget.

954
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,270
jeff, l am so not in the mood for you!

955
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,170
Get back in the subway! Now!

956
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:19,980
That's not good.

957
01:16:21,890 --> 01:16:23,380
Wait! No!

958
01:16:24,820 --> 01:16:26,150
jay!

959
01:16:26,760 --> 01:16:31,200
l cannot emphasize strongly enough how much we need you on that transport.

960
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,900
Laura! You have to go!

961
01:16:35,330 --> 01:16:36,700
Oh, jeez.

962
01:16:38,740 --> 01:16:41,530
Go. He's fine. He does this all the time.

963
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:43,870
Nope!

964
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:49,150
About to lay the smackdown on your candy ass.

965
01:16:49,550 --> 01:16:51,880
Laura! lt's your destiny!

966
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,050
l was talking, Kay!

967
01:16:55,590 --> 01:16:57,680
Hey! No biting.

968
01:16:59,460 --> 01:17:01,860
lf you don't go, we all die.

969
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:07,620
You're just as beautiful as your mother.

970
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,600
Kay? A little help?

971
01:17:29,020 --> 01:17:30,080
Kay?

972
01:17:31,960 --> 01:17:34,450
Might l suggest a bigger gun?

973
01:18:01,050 --> 01:18:02,610
- Kid?  - Yeah.

974
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,420
- Thanks for bringing me back.  - No problem.

975
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:08,510
Why didn't you tell me?

976
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:10,820
Would you have let her go?

977
01:18:32,280 --> 01:18:36,150
So, what's it like on the outside? Not doing this every day?

978
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:37,750
lt's nice.

979
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:41,720
Sleep late on the weekends. Watch the Weather Channel.

980
01:18:45,230 --> 01:18:47,360
l did miss this city.

981
01:18:48,600 --> 01:18:52,130
So Laura is Princess Lauranna's daughter.

982
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:57,410
- Did y'all...?  - MiB's a mess. Let's go, kid.

983
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:59,440
Let's go?

984
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:03,880
Thousands of people in New York and New jersey saw our little event.

985
01:19:04,050 --> 01:19:08,450
Plan needs to be thought out. Plan needs to be cool. What you...?

986
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:15,060
Kid, l'll get you trained yet.

987
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:16,720
l want one of those.

988
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:18,190
Damn!

989
01:19:23,030 --> 01:19:24,230
- Hey.  - Hey.

990
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:26,840
- How you doing?  - l'm good.

991
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:31,530
We've all been there. The girl is gone and it hurts. Wanna talk?

992
01:19:31,710 --> 01:19:33,270
- No.  - l can help.

993
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:34,430
No.

994
01:19:34,610 --> 01:19:35,670
Still sulking?

995
01:19:35,850 --> 01:19:36,840
- No.  - Yeah.

996
01:19:37,010 --> 01:19:41,250
You miss her. lt happens to all of us. l knew this hot young thing.

997
01:19:41,450 --> 01:19:44,980
When our bodies were in the positions of the Kamasutra...

998
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:46,490
Zed!

999
01:19:46,920 --> 01:19:48,790
Come on, man! Damn!

1000
01:19:49,190 --> 01:19:50,890
l'll tell you about dames.

1001
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:54,620
They say they want to be scratched, but they really want:

1002
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:56,460
Hey! Frank.

1003
01:19:56,670 --> 01:19:59,360
What? Still sitting shiva? Want my advice?

1004
01:19:59,540 --> 01:20:01,440
No. No advice.

1005
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,160
No talking.

1006
01:20:03,770 --> 01:20:05,070
Hell, no.

1007
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:07,900
Fellas, l swear, l'm fine.

1008
01:20:08,880 --> 01:20:11,680
All hail jay! All hail jay!

1009
01:20:12,220 --> 01:20:15,810
- l brought them from Grand Central.  - Why put them in my locker?

1010
01:20:16,020 --> 01:20:18,320
l thought it would put things in perspective.

1011
01:20:18,490 --> 01:20:21,190
lt's kind of sad. We need to let them out.

1012
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:24,560
They need to know the world is bigger than that.

1013
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:26,220
Still a rookie.

1014
00:00:25,206 --> 00:00:28,698
史上的疑案，請歡迎主持人葛彼得

1015
00:00:28,876 --> 00:00:30,173
第27集

1016
00:00:30,344 --> 00:00:33,745
雖然沒有人能證明他們的存在…

1017
00:00:33,914 --> 00:00:37,042
神秘的政府單位，星際戰警組織…

1018
00:00:37,218 --> 00:00:40,551
一直在地球上從事秘密行動…

1019
00:00:40,721 --> 00:00:44,817
保護地球人不受外星人侵略

1020
00:00:45,025 --> 00:00:48,483
這是一起「沒發生過」的事件…

1021
00:00:48,696 --> 00:00:52,860
來自一個「不存在」的檔案

1022
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:57,301
1978年，薩塔星領袖紛紛出走…

1023
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,032
為了逃離卡洛琳星邪惡女王塞琳娜的魔掌

1024
00:01:03,544 --> 00:01:07,446
他們把最珍貴的寶物帶到地球…

1025
00:01:07,815 --> 00:01:11,376
薩塔之光，這種威力強大的宇宙力量…

1026
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:16,549
若被敵人奪走將毀滅薩塔星

1027
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:20,492
薩塔公主勞拉懇求星際戰警…

1028
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:23,027
將薩塔之光藏起來

1029
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:25,464
但他們恕難從命

1030
00:01:25,633 --> 00:01:29,125
插手此事將導致地球滅亡

1031
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:35,601
但是英勇的星際戰警卻制伏難纏的塞琳娜…

1032
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:38,006
讓薩塔人順利脫逃…

1033
00:01:38,178 --> 00:01:41,841
將薩塔之光藏到別處

1034
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:47,647
塞琳娜誓言要奪回薩塔之光…

1035
00:01:47,821 --> 00:01:52,758
並毀滅膽敢阻止她的星球

1036
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:56,725
這事件被歷史淹沒…

1037
00:01:56,864 --> 00:02:02,063
神秘的星際戰警再一次拯救地球…

1038
00:02:02,236 --> 00:02:05,296
他們就是MIB

1039
00:03:35,596 --> 00:03:39,362
2002年7月

1040
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:49,966
給我過來！

1041
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:52,639
乖！

1042
00:03:52,813 --> 00:03:55,043
別對著月亮亂叫

1043
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:16,928
「維多利亞的秘密」

1044
00:05:58,305 --> 00:06:00,102
大美女

1045
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,736
你的味道真好

1046
00:06:06,914 --> 00:06:08,176
搞什麼？

1047
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:15,687
你的味道也不賴

1048
00:07:04,738 --> 00:07:07,206
別耍帥逞英雄，乖乖守規矩

1049
00:07:07,374 --> 00:07:08,841
知道啦！

1050
00:07:09,943 --> 00:07:12,309
傑夫，怎麼了？

1051
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,438
-你跑來這兒幹嘛？   -老大在跟你說話

1052
00:07:16,783 --> 00:07:20,879
咱們都說好了，你只要留在E、F跟R線地鐵隧道…

1053
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:23,488
想吃多少垃圾都行

1054
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,420
你跑來幹嘛，小蟲蟲？

1055
00:07:26,627 --> 00:07:27,594
T

1056
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,559
傑夫…

1057
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,891
饒了他吧，他是個菜鳥…

1058
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,891
也是個傻瓜

1059
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:48,715
你變胖了，你吃了什麼呀？

1060
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,683
你想玩玩，是吧？

1061
00:07:57,257 --> 00:07:58,849
傑夫！

1062
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:07,160
好吧

1063
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:10,466
睡個好覺吧，大傢伙

1064
00:08:45,505 --> 00:08:47,063
做個好夢吧…

1065
00:08:53,447 --> 00:08:56,211
我是地鐵局工作人員，請大家走到前列車廂

1066
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,977
電路系統有異物入侵

1067
00:09:01,021 --> 00:09:06,084
喂，你們這些人！有異物入侵啦！

1068
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,624
你們知道要逃了吧

1069
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:13,493
別走，坐呀

1070
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:15,635
只是條六百英尺的大蟲嘛

1071
00:09:18,905 --> 00:09:22,966
-你們都給我滾出去   -我要你全速前進

1072
00:09:23,143 --> 00:09:26,601
這裏我才是老大

1073
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,408
你是老大？ 好吧，給我過來

1074
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,642
老大？看這是我的朋友

1075
00:09:34,988 --> 00:09:39,152
-我瞭解了   -你快給我滾進去

1076
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:49,134
別逼我開槍！傑夫

1077
00:10:15,028 --> 00:10:16,791
81街站

1078
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:21,993
等一下

1079
00:10:23,336 --> 00:10:26,169
大家請注意

1080
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:29,573
紐約市感謝各位參加這次演習

1081
00:10:29,743 --> 00:10:32,803
如果是真的，你們都會被吃掉

1082
00:10:32,979 --> 00:10:35,539
你們不肯聽話、愚蠢無知

1083
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:39,879
我都一頭撞進車廂了，這就是你們紐約人的毛病

1084
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:43,682
「我們什麼怪事都看過了
大蟲蟲耶，救我啊，黑人先生！」

1085
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:48,054
我很客氣請你們到前列車廂你們卻無動於衷

1086
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:51,657
感謝各位參加這次演習

1087
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:55,734
這是全新的小型省電地鐵列車

1088
00:10:56,203 --> 00:10:59,297
小心月台間隙，祝您愉快

1089
00:11:02,876 --> 00:11:06,471
派清理小組到81街和公園路

1090
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:09,137
立刻撤銷傑夫的行動許可

1091
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:12,149
派人把他送回查伯街站

1092
00:11:12,319 --> 00:11:17,279
最後麻煩哪一位檢查下麻醉劑的使用期限

1093
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,492
抱歉，地鐵停運

1094
00:11:23,797 --> 00:11:27,995
-緊急演習，以策安全   -什麼爛地鐵嘛？

1095
00:11:29,603 --> 00:11:31,093
不客氣

1096
00:11:44,784 --> 00:11:47,014
我知道，我沒守規矩

1097
00:11:47,187 --> 00:11:51,647
我們有多久沒抬頭看星星？

1098
00:11:51,858 --> 00:11:54,827
你在考我，我知道

1099
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:59,824
我們在宇宙是孤零零的嗎？

1100
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,490
是

1101
00:12:03,503 --> 00:12:05,130
不是

1102
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,433
-我請你吃一塊派   -真的假的？

1103
00:12:11,177 --> 00:12:12,405
謝了

1104
00:12:13,179 --> 00:12:15,943
你不是孤零零的

1105
00:12:16,116 --> 00:12:18,311
-把手拿開   -好

1106
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:24,347
給我閉嘴，查理

1107
00:12:24,424 --> 00:12:27,188
你老是在我背後說壞話

1108
00:12:28,995 --> 00:12:32,829
你泡到一個漂亮美眉你卻跟人家說這句蠢話：

1109
00:12:32,999 --> 00:12:37,129
你想玩3P吃蛋沙拉嗎？

1110
00:12:37,504 --> 00:12:40,962
-你是誰？你是怎麼進來的？   -你愛吃蛋沙拉嗎？

1111
00:12:44,244 --> 00:12:45,643
塞琳娜！ 

1112
00:12:45,812 --> 00:12:49,043
早說是你嘛

1113
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:52,409
-我收到消息，薩塔之光呢？   -事情是這樣

1114
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:54,952
你到處在找這個什麼光，我們找到了

1115
00:12:55,121 --> 00:12:59,421
你要的話就得付五千萬，咱們就這麼做--

1116
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:02,561
薩塔之光呢？

1117
00:13:07,467 --> 00:13:11,801
不知道，不過有一個人知道

1118
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:15,032
他在春泉街開一家披薩店

1119
00:13:16,343 --> 00:13:20,177
走吧，擦擦鼻子，豬頭

1120
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,350
-真好吃   -是啊

1121
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,357
人真多

1122
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,288
這家店很有名

1123
00:13:39,766 --> 00:13:41,097
你是怎麼了？

1124
00:13:41,267 --> 00:13:43,462
-你要消除我的記憶  -不會啦

1125
00:13:43,637 --> 00:13:46,197
你會，你怕我出糗才帶我來這兒 

1126
00:13:46,373 --> 00:13:48,170
你這樣很糗耶

1127
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,208
我問你，你為何加入MIB？

1128
00:13:52,379 --> 00:13:55,906
我是軍人，我想盡忠報國 捍衛地球

1129
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:59,381
你想當英雄？你來錯地方了

1130
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:03,544
-你聽過詹姆斯艾德華嗎？   -沒有

1131
00:14:04,024 --> 00:14:07,721
他今天在地鐵站救了85人

1132
00:14:07,927 --> 00:14:09,895
沒有人知道他的存在

1133
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:15,333
他不存在怎麼能當英雄？

1134
00:14:19,105 --> 00:14:21,335
我們什麼時候開始搭檔的？

1135
00:14:21,508 --> 00:14:24,477
-二月一號   -五個月零三天

1136
00:14:24,644 --> 00:14:27,340
-中午開始   -九小時

1137
00:14:34,387 --> 00:14:36,855
去結婚然後生孩子

1138
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,017
好吧

1139
00:14:41,795 --> 00:14:47,290
不好意思，他很害羞，不過他對你有意思

1140
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,628
你瞧

1141
00:14:55,241 --> 00:14:56,708
我不知道該說什麼

1142
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:59,811
你知道大家看了會說什麼嗎？

1143
00:14:59,979 --> 00:15:03,312
-員工的員少寫一個口？  -這是照筆划算錢的嘛

1144
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:07,613
「她這大人物在這兒打過工」

1145
00:15:07,787 --> 00:15:09,186
-班..   -這是你應得的

1146
00:15:09,355 --> 00:15:12,483
順便到地下室搬一箱汽水

1147
00:15:18,064 --> 00:15:22,592
兩片香腸口味披薩，還有關於薩塔之光的消息

1148
00:15:22,769 --> 00:15:26,136
-求求你，別傷害我   -薩塔之光呢？

1149
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:29,742
我不知道你在說什麼，把我放下來

1150
00:15:29,909 --> 00:15:32,002
我要報案…

1151
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:41,078
後面

1152
00:15:41,654 --> 00:15:42,916
有聲音

1153
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,924
廚房啦！

1154
00:15:49,929 --> 00:15:51,954
你們兩個豬頭看到什麼？

1155
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:55,191
後門被風吹開

1156
00:15:55,869 --> 00:15:57,837
沒什麼異狀

1157
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:01,332
這25年來我尋遍宇宙

1158
00:16:01,508 --> 00:16:04,443
但是它卻還在地球，對吧？ 你把它藏在這兒？

1159
00:16:04,611 --> 00:16:06,340
你在說什麼？

1160
00:16:06,513 --> 00:16:09,038
我沒時間了，薩塔之光呢？

1161
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:12,013
-我發誓我不知道  -聽好了，薩塔人

1162
00:16:12,185 --> 00:16:14,745
你把它藏在地球，我會找到它

1163
00:16:14,921 --> 00:16:18,448
到時候薩塔星就是我的

1164
00:16:18,658 --> 00:16:21,183
來不及了，明天午夜…

1165
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:24,852
它就會離開第三行星

1166
00:16:25,064 --> 00:16:28,329
你白跑一趟了

1167
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:40,170
東西到底在不在地球？

1168
00:16:40,346 --> 00:16:42,746
第三行星就是地球，白癡

1169
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,613
-太陽數過來第三顆行星？   -我到現在才知道耶

1170
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,988
有一個人知道它的下落

1171
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,477
-你不回家嗎？  -沒錯

1172
00:17:18,651 --> 00:17:21,449
你又開除一個搭檔

1173
00:17:28,061 --> 00:17:30,689
你們下次用核融碳化槍…

1174
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:34,595
記得在槍管上裝原子消音器

1175
00:17:34,767 --> 00:17:39,067
穿鞋子吧，你刮花地板了

1176
00:17:42,475 --> 00:17:43,874
檢查這傢伙的護照

1177
00:17:44,043 --> 00:17:48,207
烏賊人在偽造星際護照

1178
00:17:48,381 --> 00:17:53,648
這兒怎麼會有一隻死異形？

1179
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:57,984
是我的錯，對不起，請你別消除我的記憶

1180
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:01,683
-那是什麼意思？  -沒什麼意思

1181
00:18:05,198 --> 00:18:06,722
你在地鐵站幹得不錯

1182
00:18:06,933 --> 00:18:10,835
-我記得傑夫以前才這麼大   -還有什麼任務？

1183
00:18:11,004 --> 00:18:13,302
看到下面那些穿黑西裝的嗎？

1184
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:16,533
-他們也是星際戰警，放輕鬆點   -Z，拜託，有什麼任務？

1185
00:18:16,709 --> 00:18:20,941
盡忠職守是一回事，不過千萬別為工作鞠躬盡瘁

1186
00:18:21,114 --> 00:18:24,083
你想五十歲時也像我這樣嗎？…

1187
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:26,409
五十幾了？

1188
00:18:27,287 --> 00:18:29,517
我去健身房

1189
00:18:30,189 --> 00:18:33,556
春泉街發生一起兇殺案

1190
00:18:33,726 --> 00:18:35,023
死者兇手都是外星人

1191
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:37,662
你帶T一起去吧

1192
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:44,637
他哦 他...

1193
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:46,434
護照加簽，不是急件，怎麼樣？ 

1194
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:49,632
你不能一直開除MIB員工

1195
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:52,039
那老兄在餐館哭哭啼啼的

1196
00:18:52,211 --> 00:18:53,735
太遜了

1197
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:56,542
而且L不算

1198
00:18:56,716 --> 00:18:59,651
是她自己想回停屍間的，我只是幫她個忙

1199
00:18:59,819 --> 00:19:02,720
-你需要一個搭檔   -用不著

1200
00:19:03,056 --> 00:19:05,024
讓我當他的搭檔

1201
00:19:05,925 --> 00:19:08,894
J，等等，謝謝你的提拔

1202
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:11,256
-我早就想離開收發室了  -把西裝脫掉

1203
00:19:11,431 --> 00:19:13,626
沒問題，我只是想扮酷

1204
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:16,496
我穿黑西裝看起來比較瘦

1205
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:19,297
不過我照樣泡得到美眉

1206
00:19:19,472 --> 00:19:21,064
只是想要....

1207
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,969
好炫的車子

1208
00:19:23,142 --> 00:19:25,269
椅墊夠軟嗎？我有痔瘡

1209
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:48,064
弗蘭克！

1210
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:52,563
你再唱我就拿出狗頭鍘了

1211
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:54,104
好啦

1212
00:20:00,113 --> 00:20:01,546
弗蘭克！

1213
00:20:02,849 --> 00:20:04,783
狗爬式那招最爽了

1214
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:08,011
前幾天我認識一隻大丹狗

1215
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:10,451
身材有點胖，不過臉很漂亮

1216
00:20:10,656 --> 00:20:13,716
我對你的艷遇一點也不感興趣

1217
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:16,224
那咱們來扮好警察壞警察

1218
00:20:16,396 --> 00:20:18,887
你負責問話，我負責耍狠

1219
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:23,330
我們來扮好警察跟蠢狗，你給我乖乖閉嘴？

1220
00:20:23,503 --> 00:20:25,869
沒問題，一聲不響、寂靜無聲

1221
00:20:26,039 --> 00:20:29,372
連一個字也不會說

1222
00:20:30,109 --> 00:20:31,701
有什麼狀況？

1223
00:20:34,447 --> 00:20:37,314
-什麼狀況？  -牆壁和地板都有磷殘痕

1224
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:42,386
-我已經送回總部進行分析  -他的身體脂肪是零耶

1225
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:46,818
-很好笑  -目擊證人？

1226
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,318
那女生目擊一切

1227
00:20:49,529 --> 00:20:50,496
勞拉

1228
00:20:50,696 --> 00:20:52,061
她還蠻鎮靜的

1229
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:56,395
你要先跟我解釋我才回答，這是怎麼回事？

1230
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:58,863
-這最好讓我來處理  -沒問題

1231
00:20:59,038 --> 00:21:02,405
我一個人去，她看到會說話的狗會抓狂

1232
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:04,634
你要我做什麼？

1233
00:21:04,944 --> 00:21:07,003
到處聞一下

1234
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,104
幹嘛？

1235
00:21:09,615 --> 00:21:10,741
很好笑

1236
00:21:10,917 --> 00:21:13,385
請你深呼吸，一切都很好

1237
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:16,681
這一切怎麼會很好？

1238
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:21,449
我是J探員

1239
00:21:21,661 --> 00:21:23,128
你到底看到什麼？

1240
00:21:23,329 --> 00:21:25,797
-一個雙頭人和穿皮衣女人  -白人嗎？

1241
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,990
她的手會伸出觸角來剝掉..

1242
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:30,226
剝掉他的皮膚

1243
00:21:30,403 --> 00:21:35,705
那不是皮膚，是原生質保護膜，跟口香糖的化學成份很像

1244
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,435
-你在案發前吃了什麼？  -披薩

1245
00:21:38,611 --> 00:21:39,737
-幾時？  -中午

1246
00:21:39,912 --> 00:21:42,278
-菠菜口味？  -蘑菇

1247
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:44,707
走，我請你吃派

1248
00:21:44,817 --> 00:21:49,845
他們一直問班什麼光的事

1249
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,280
你還好吧？

1250
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:55,791
我認識一輩子的人在我面前消失不見…

1251
00:21:55,962 --> 00:21:58,487
我看到一個女人手上有觸角…

1252
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:01,394
還有一個零智商的雙頭人

1253
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,229
我好得不得了

1254
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:09,536
我們小時候，還沒上學之前…

1255
00:22:09,709 --> 00:22:13,042
心裏都相信有外星人

1256
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:18,115
我知道我看到什麼，你說我該相信什麼？

1257
00:22:23,789 --> 00:22:28,886
我為一個秘密單位服務，專門監控地球上的外星人活動

1258
00:22:29,095 --> 00:22:31,256
班是外星人，兇手也是

1259
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:35,423
我不知道原因，但我會查出來

1260
00:22:36,702 --> 00:22:38,670
好吧

1261
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:41,596
-好嗎？   -好

1262
00:22:43,009 --> 00:22:44,442
很好

1263
00:22:49,749 --> 00:22:52,513
-很抱歉，我必須..    -殺了我

1264
00:22:52,685 --> 00:22:54,209
不，不是啦

1265
00:22:54,387 --> 00:22:58,323
閃一下你就什麼都忘了

1266
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:02,124
閃一下後…

1267
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:04,695
我還會認得你嗎？

1268
00:23:04,864 --> 00:23:06,855
我認得你

1269
00:23:09,569 --> 00:23:11,298
但你不會認得我

1270
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:13,529
這樣好辛苦

1271
00:23:13,706 --> 00:23:15,606
你一定很寂寞

1272
00:23:31,424 --> 00:23:32,391
對不起

1273
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:36,728
-我得走了  -你不閃我了嗎？

1274
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:40,525
改天再說吧

1275
00:23:58,317 --> 00:23:59,944
幹嘛？

1276
00:24:04,624 --> 00:24:09,994
-你跟她說你愛她嗎？  -拜託，她只是目擊證人

1277
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,259
你迷上她了，我跟她不同種都迷上她了

1278
00:24:14,433 --> 00:24:18,392
你只會追著尾巴咬，哪懂得泡妞？

1279
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:22,598
別這樣，這是狗歧視

1280
00:24:39,358 --> 00:24:40,655
J，等等我

1281
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,829
借過，星際警犬來也

1282
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:47,966
我是狗探員，J的新搭檔，看什麼看？

1283
00:24:48,134 --> 00:24:50,398
別緊張，狗狗

1284
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:53,729
-你有小孩嗎？  -沒有

1285
00:24:53,906 --> 00:24:55,373
想要嗎？

1286
00:24:58,577 --> 00:25:00,545
快來幫我啊

1287
00:25:08,921 --> 00:25:11,583
-怎麼樣？  -卡洛琳星C級太空船

1288
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:12,758
塞琳娜

1289
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:15,290
-塞琳娜，你前女友啊？  -她想得美

1290
00:25:15,461 --> 00:25:18,123
證人說嫌犯在找什麼光--

1291
00:25:18,297 --> 00:25:19,958
-薩塔之光   -對，那是什麼？

1292
00:25:20,132 --> 00:25:22,600
沒道理，那不在地球

1293
00:25:22,768 --> 00:25:26,033
-我們早就搞定了  -很顯然你們沒搞定

1294
00:25:26,205 --> 00:25:28,230
真是壞消息

1295
00:25:28,407 --> 00:25:32,104
25年前薩塔人來到地球，想把薩塔之光藏起來

1296
00:25:32,278 --> 00:25:35,770
-我們不能這麼做   -沒錯，我命令他們把它帶走

1297
00:25:35,948 --> 00:25:37,575
嗯，Z…

1298
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:42,187
中央公園有一艘卡洛琳太空船，你確定薩塔之光不在這兒？

1299
00:25:42,355 --> 00:25:45,950
確定，我派最頂尖的探員處理的

1300
00:25:46,158 --> 00:25:48,683
-跟我交給你一樣放心  -那就去問他呀

1301
00:25:48,894 --> 00:25:49,952
-辦不到  -他掛了？

1302
00:25:50,162 --> 00:25:53,290
差不多，他在郵局上班

1303
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:55,593
不是吧

1304
00:25:55,768 --> 00:25:58,430
要是K先被塞琳娜找到就死定了

1305
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:01,630
地球的命運握在他手上

1306
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:04,275
可惜你消除了他的記憶

1307
00:26:04,443 --> 00:26:05,933
把他帶回來

1308
00:26:06,312 --> 00:26:07,301
馬上去

1309
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,541
酷斃了，我們去找K探員，傳奇人物、辦案高手

1310
00:26:11,717 --> 00:26:14,242
把一身本領傳授給你的師父

1311
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:19,050
-MIB史上最偉大的探員  -弗蘭克！別再說話了

1312
00:26:22,895 --> 00:26:24,157
乖乖坐著

1313
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,924
喂，我雖看起來像小狗   但那只是…

1314
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:29,567
我在地球的掩護

1315
00:26:29,935 --> 00:26:32,403
-隨便啦，擦擦口水   -喂，辣妹

1316
00:26:38,778 --> 00:26:42,077
各位特魯羅鎮民請大家注意聽

1317
00:26:42,248 --> 00:26:44,682
為了加速郵件處理…

1318
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:47,512
每一件包裹都要正確包裝

1319
00:26:47,686 --> 00:26:51,554
這一個就是錯誤的示範

1320
00:26:51,757 --> 00:26:54,521
維吉辛太太，我想就是你的

1321
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:59,562
牛皮紙和麻繩是標準包法

1322
00:26:59,732 --> 00:27:01,461
謝謝大家

1323
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:05,565
-K   -這是C窗口，快遞和空運郵件

1324
00:27:07,506 --> 00:27:08,632
凱文

1325
00:27:10,342 --> 00:27:13,539
凱文，真好笑，你不太像凱文…

1326
00:27:16,282 --> 00:27:18,512
你不記得我，我們一起工作過

1327
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:22,780
我沒在殯儀館上過班，帥哥，有什麼我能效勞嗎？

1328
00:27:22,955 --> 00:27:24,582
我就直說吧

1329
00:27:25,357 --> 00:27:29,589
你曾是秘密機構成員，負責監控住在地球上的外星人

1330
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:33,789
我們是星際戰警，現在出了狀況，我們需要你

1331
00:27:33,966 --> 00:27:37,697
外面有一家免費的精神病院

1332
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,838
-下一位   -對不起

1333
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:42,397
-二十張淘氣小兵郵票    -伊麗莎白

1334
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:46,875
美國郵政總署沒跟得上潮流…

1335
00:27:47,046 --> 00:27:49,708
我們有二戰紀念郵票    歌劇名伶？

1336
00:27:49,882 --> 00:27:52,851
美屬薩摩亞群島風景？ 阿米什人？

1337
00:27:53,018 --> 00:27:55,748
小乖乖，我們得拯救世界

1338
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:59,147
你當年並沒昏迷，那全是幌子

1339
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:01,121
-你是誰？   -問題是，你是誰？

1340
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:05,593
我是麻省特魯羅鎮郵局局長
我命令你離開這兒

1341
00:28:08,501 --> 00:28:09,968
-無咖啡因嗎？   -對不起

1342
00:28:10,135 --> 00:28:12,501
各位，有人非法入侵

1343
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:15,663
封鎖現場，徹底清除現場

1344
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:20,244
立刻將閒雜人等趕出去

1345
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:23,575
你自己聽，誰會這麼說話？

1346
00:29:19,572 --> 00:29:22,439
難怪你在這裏如魚得水

1347
00:29:24,009 --> 00:29:27,843
郵局員工幾乎全是外星人

1348
00:29:35,521 --> 00:29:37,546
不准吸煙

1349
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:47,591
K

1350
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,529
我跟我太太到賭城看過魔術師讓白老虎飛起來

1351
00:29:51,704 --> 00:29:53,194
小子，你這套把戲還不夠看

1352
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:56,273
當你抬頭看星星，內心深處…

1353
00:29:56,442 --> 00:29:58,433
不知道自己是誰

1354
00:29:58,611 --> 00:30:02,240
你對外星的瞭解甚於你自己

1355
00:30:02,414 --> 00:30:07,010
所以你老婆才會離開你

1356
00:30:09,021 --> 00:30:10,852
非常好

1357
00:30:11,056 --> 00:30:14,958
你想知道自己的身份就跟我來

1358
00:30:15,127 --> 00:30:18,961
要不然你就回去送信吧

1359
00:30:22,134 --> 00:30:23,624
他來不來？

1360
00:30:29,541 --> 00:30:33,272
我就跟你去一趟，事情不對勁我就馬上走人

1361
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:35,003
K探員

1362
00:30:36,348 --> 00:30:38,612
你好嗎？

1363
00:30:52,931 --> 00:30:54,762
K，很高興見到你

1364
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,993
我也是，不管你是誰

1365
00:30:59,371 --> 00:31:03,569
我就跟你去看看吧

1366
00:31:14,019 --> 00:31:16,317
歡迎歸隊，K探員

1367
00:31:17,589 --> 00:31:18,851
K探員

1368
00:31:19,491 --> 00:31:21,584
你好，K

1369
00:31:23,762 --> 00:31:25,059
你們看誰回來了

1370
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:27,790
-我不想打擾你   -天啊，你是K探員！

1371
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:31,129
-大家都這麼說   -幸會，我是G探員

1372
00:31:31,303 --> 00:31:33,771
MIB史上最受尊敬的探員

1373
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:36,430
全宇宙最有名的人類在我面前

1374
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:39,577
我想請你喝杯咖啡

1375
00:31:39,745 --> 00:31:42,407
-黑咖啡，兩塊方糖   -我的榮幸

1376
00:31:42,581 --> 00:31:45,948
-我的要....   -很高興見到你，K

1377
00:31:47,619 --> 00:31:49,018
怎麼樣？

1378
00:31:49,188 --> 00:31:51,656
卓拉人走了，條約也簽了

1379
00:31:51,857 --> 00:31:52,824
幹得好

1380
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:56,358
Z，那你答應我的職位呢？

1381
00:31:56,528 --> 00:31:59,929
我在替你爭取外星人保障名額，有消息就通知你

1382
00:32:00,099 --> 00:32:02,363
等等，你明明答應的

1383
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:04,627
-收訊不良   -Z？

1384
00:32:04,803 --> 00:32:08,398
-我聽不到，再聯絡吧    -我可以當M探員--

1385
00:32:09,141 --> 00:32:13,908
K，地球面臨危機，你是唯一的救星

1386
00:32:14,079 --> 00:32:17,173
-我們郵差總是風兩無阻….   -很好

1387
00:32:17,349 --> 00:32:21,251
準備好就帶他去恢復記憶

1388
00:32:22,421 --> 00:32:23,547
-弗蘭克   -幹嘛？

1389
00:32:23,756 --> 00:32:26,725
我需要他們一起行動

1390
00:32:27,226 --> 00:32:30,787
我正在找新助理，不能出任務，不過有牙醫保險

1391
00:32:30,996 --> 00:32:32,463
牙醫保險？

1392
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:41,872
這裏是技術部門，全宇宙最先進的科技都在這兒

1393
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:45,074
我們沒救了！完了！

1394
00:32:46,145 --> 00:32:47,703
別碰那個

1395
00:32:48,647 --> 00:32:50,547
我什麼也沒做

1396
00:32:50,716 --> 00:32:53,879
手插在口袋

1397
00:33:03,328 --> 00:33:05,455
你最愛用的武器

1398
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,497
-這個小玩意兒？   -對

1399
00:33:11,003 --> 00:33:13,096
-去穿上吧   -什麼？

1400
00:33:13,272 --> 00:33:15,604
你穿的最後一套西裝

1401
00:33:15,774 --> 00:33:17,332
又穿一次

1402
00:33:24,449 --> 00:33:25,780
這是記憶恢復器

1403
00:33:27,352 --> 00:33:30,412
逆轉磁能量將通過你的大腦…

1404
00:33:30,589 --> 00:33:35,185
喚起你腦內的遙遠記憶

1405
00:33:35,394 --> 00:33:38,022
好吧，那是什麼？

1406
00:33:39,398 --> 00:33:41,423
記憶恢復器

1407
00:33:48,874 --> 00:33:52,901
歡迎光臨地球，你必須遵守一些規矩

1408
00:33:53,078 --> 00:33:54,477
你只能晚上出門

1409
00:33:54,646 --> 00:33:58,878
白天只能去東區

1410
00:34:03,322 --> 00:34:04,846
喂…！

1411
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,994
姓名及星籍？

1412
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:15,895
賽琳娜，卡魯系卓恩星

1413
00:34:16,902 --> 00:34:20,929
-你有攜帶食物嗎？   -有，兩顆菜頭

1414
00:34:21,106 --> 00:34:22,095
來訪的目的？

1415
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:25,801
教育性質，我希望學會當內衣模特兒

1416
00:34:25,978 --> 00:34:28,708
他們說我很有潛力

1417
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:33,047
來人呀，他有心臟病！

1418
00:34:34,286 --> 00:34:35,719
讓開！

1419
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,980
快醒醒！

1420
00:34:44,196 --> 00:34:47,654
-慘了   -全面封鎖

1421
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:50,568
全面封鎖

1422
00:34:51,470 --> 00:34:54,098
情況不妙，情況不妙

1423
00:35:00,779 --> 00:35:03,771
-出了狀況，我們會被衝出去   -衝出去？

1424
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:07,477
-你去過水上樂園嗎   -我不記得

1425
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,651
好爽

1426
00:35:44,122 --> 00:35:48,252
你以前最愛被衝出來了

1427
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:53,022
每禮拜六晚上你都說
衝我吧，J

1428
00:35:53,198 --> 00:35:54,927
我攔都攔不住

1429
00:35:56,568 --> 00:35:58,058
你不能放棄

1430
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:01,137
我拯救世界你就告訴我一切

1431
00:36:01,306 --> 00:36:02,864
好

1432
00:36:03,976 --> 00:36:08,879
-上車   -上什麼車？

1433
00:36:13,018 --> 00:36:14,542
那是標準配備嗎？

1434
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,850
原來是黑人，不過他老被臨檢

1435
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:26,262
可笑的星球，只要我是波霸就能統治世界

1436
00:36:26,631 --> 00:36:28,189
這下他們…

1437
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:29,992
逃不出去了

1438
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:32,762
電腦，監看MIB總部

1439
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:39,373
MIB全面封鎖

1440
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,075
放大，放大十倍

1441
00:36:46,218 --> 00:36:48,118
跟弗蘭克通話

1442
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:50,719
-J，你在哪兒？   -我們被衝出來

1443
00:36:50,922 --> 00:36:53,049
-MIB總部被佔領了   -是誰幹的？

1444
00:36:53,258 --> 00:36:56,227
一個超級辣妹，你要我跟蹤她嗎？

1445
00:36:56,395 --> 00:37:01,230
-待在原地，我會保持聯絡
-是啊，待在原地，你說的倒容易

1446
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,799
-找到K探員嗎？   -他被消除記憶

1447
00:37:02,968 --> 00:37:05,596
-他變成平民了   -什麼？

1448
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:06,795
-不過...   -他來這兒

1449
00:37:06,972 --> 00:37:08,303
-恢復記憶...   -恢復記憶？

1450
00:37:08,473 --> 00:37:13,001
-他被消除記憶，我們會找到他   -別往我們耳朵塞東西

1451
00:37:13,979 --> 00:37:14,968
幹嘛？

1452
00:37:15,147 --> 00:37:18,605
這是什麼？我在口袋找到的，很怪吧？

1453
00:37:18,784 --> 00:37:21,514
-對啊，你竟然在微笑   -隻有一台記憶恢復器嗎？

1454
00:37:21,686 --> 00:37:24,621
只做了一台，不過幾年前藍圖流入網路

1455
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:26,791
上網

1456
00:37:26,992 --> 00:37:28,823
記憶恢復器

1457
00:37:32,864 --> 00:37:34,832
太好了，是個老朋友

1458
00:37:42,607 --> 00:37:44,632
J，好久不見

1459
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:47,540
你看到我的敞篷車嗎？

1460
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,839
生意好得不得了

1461
00:37:50,348 --> 00:37:53,715
你一定要上我的網站瞧瞧...

1462
00:37:53,952 --> 00:37:55,977
喂，他退休了耶？

1463
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,184
我們要記憶恢復器

1464
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,723
-別開玩笑   -別浪費時間

1465
00:38:04,096 --> 00:38:06,326
你記得我嗎？

1466
00:38:06,865 --> 00:38:08,958
不記得，我通常很會認人

1467
00:38:09,568 --> 00:38:11,263
尤其是這張醜臉

1468
00:38:12,471 --> 00:38:14,530
偉大的K探員淪為平民

1469
00:38:14,706 --> 00:38:19,006
只有你能恢復我的記憶，你到底有沒有記憶恢復器？

1470
00:38:19,177 --> 00:38:20,508
沒有

1471
00:38:21,646 --> 00:38:23,136
賣完了

1472
00:38:24,382 --> 00:38:26,043
不好意思

1473
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,644
沒貨了

1474
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,232
就算我有，機器失效你就會轟掉我的腦袋

1475
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,427
要是K恢復了記憶，他也會把我的腦袋轟掉

1476
00:38:46,605 --> 00:38:48,505
我有什麼好處？

1477
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:53,004
好啦，我放在除雪機旁邊

1478
00:38:56,515 --> 00:38:59,746
外星囚犯被釋放，整裝待發、聽命行事

1479
00:38:59,918 --> 00:39:03,354
全宇宙的壞痞子們聽好

1480
00:39:03,788 --> 00:39:05,380
現在輪到壞人當家了

1481
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,024
我有個麻煩，事情很簡單

1482
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:11,861
我要薩塔之光，K知道下落

1483
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:14,362
只要找到K就能統治地球

1484
00:39:14,533 --> 00:39:17,832
先找到記憶恢復器

1485
00:39:18,003 --> 00:39:19,834
收到

1486
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:22,029
馬上去

1487
00:39:25,443 --> 00:39:27,411
夏拉，很高興見到你

1488
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:33,283
應該沒問題了

1489
00:39:33,451 --> 00:39:37,820
請仔細聽我解釋安全措施

1490
00:39:38,023 --> 00:39:40,514
請勿將頭手伸出遊樂設施外

1491
00:39:40,725 --> 00:39:43,751
如果你感到頭昏腦脹…

1492
00:39:43,962 --> 00:39:46,624
我一點辦法也沒有

1493
00:39:48,099 --> 00:39:50,533
你脫掉首飾珠寶了嗎？

1494
00:39:52,137 --> 00:39:54,537
-你會對貝類食物過敏嗎？   -快點！

1495
00:39:54,706 --> 00:39:57,504
好吧，開始了

1496
00:40:04,049 --> 00:40:05,482
你用過這玩意嗎？

1497
00:40:05,684 --> 00:40:09,450
我用排氣管烤過爆米花

1498
00:40:09,621 --> 00:40:12,556
好啦，開始吧

1499
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:35,577
「警告」

1500
00:41:07,746 --> 00:41:09,179
搞定了

1501
00:41:22,894 --> 00:41:24,885
-你恢復記憶了   -沒有

1502
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:28,293
-你怎麼知道他的頭會長出來？   -它會長出來？

1503
00:41:30,802 --> 00:41:34,704
非常好，我再也不幫你們了

1504
00:41:37,175 --> 00:41:39,666
-你記起什麼嗎？   -再見

1505
00:41:39,844 --> 00:41:41,402
-K   -K，等等

1506
00:41:42,247 --> 00:41:45,774
我一直沒有更新軟體，我還在用6.0版

1507
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:47,884
你的大腦要重新開機

1508
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,451
你要等一下

1509
00:41:50,622 --> 00:41:52,021
K！

1510
00:41:52,324 --> 00:41:57,527
我誠心誠意地向你道歉，希望這不會影響我們的友情

1511
00:41:57,729 --> 00:42:02,257
這麼多年來的互相信任和尊敬

1512
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:06,000
他在那兒！

1513
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:10,007
-K呢？   -他不在！他去...

1514
00:42:10,208 --> 00:42:13,541
K退休了，我是他的接班人，我能效勞嗎？

1515
00:42:13,712 --> 00:42:17,273
太好了，正中我的嘴巴，我失去味覺了

1516
00:42:17,449 --> 00:42:19,917
-放下武器   -不要

1517
00:42:25,457 --> 00:42:27,948
J，你好嗎？

1518
00:42:28,159 --> 00:42:30,753
-他們在找K   -他現在是平民

1519
00:42:30,962 --> 00:42:34,625
-我們早就知道了   -是啊，我們早就....

1520
00:42:34,799 --> 00:42:36,391
對不起

1521
00:42:36,568 --> 00:42:38,559
-保重   -謝謝

1522
00:42:39,838 --> 00:42:43,865
我不把K帶回去，塞琳娜會海扁我

1523
00:42:44,042 --> 00:42:46,101
-他在哪裏？   -你說誰呀？

1524
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:48,837
你臉色看起來不太好

1525
00:42:49,581 --> 00:42:51,446
你的臉真難看

1526
00:42:54,252 --> 00:42:57,119
不對，他的臉更難看

1527
00:42:59,758 --> 00:43:01,658
-把他折彎  -把他折彎

1528
00:43:01,826 --> 00:43:03,691
該死，別這樣

1529
00:43:41,433 --> 00:43:43,230
謝謝你腳下留情

1530
00:43:43,802 --> 00:43:45,099
不客氣

1531
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,754
-我快要吐了   -別這麼狠

1532
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,919
-大夥兒，他說的是實話   -那他就沒用了

1533
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,292
-小子，你還沒學會嗎？   -三眼怪

1534
00:44:20,872 --> 00:44:22,567
扯他的頭須！

1535
00:44:24,642 --> 00:44:29,545
K，他是吊面人

1536
00:44:33,051 --> 00:44:35,576
-小鬼，你差點就沒命   -我搞得定

1537
00:44:35,753 --> 00:44:38,551
-你需要一個搭檔   -我本來有啊，但他應付不來

1538
00:44:38,756 --> 00:44:41,054
我回來了，你的衣服髒了

1539
00:44:41,259 --> 00:44:43,124
你的記憶恢復了？

1540
00:44:43,294 --> 00:44:45,728
-這是怎麼回事？   -不知道

1541
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:48,365
-薩塔之光是什麼？   -從沒聽過

1542
00:44:48,533 --> 00:44:49,557
好耶

1543
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:55,236
你不記得薩塔之光？

1544
00:44:55,406 --> 00:44:58,102
我一定消除了這部份的記憶

1545
00:44:58,276 --> 00:45:01,541
-棒極了，你在幹嘛？   -一向都是我開車

1546
00:45:01,713 --> 00:45:03,704
-不對   -我記得

1547
00:45:03,882 --> 00:45:07,818
你以前開的是那輛破車

1548
00:45:07,986 --> 00:45:11,046
我開的是全新炫車

1549
00:45:11,256 --> 00:45:14,851
你開破車，我開炫車

1550
00:45:23,801 --> 00:45:25,894
我的炫車完蛋了

1551
00:45:26,271 --> 00:45:28,967
-塞琳娜，求求你   -好久不見

1552
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:32,769
你還記得我，我好感動哦

1553
00:45:32,944 --> 00:45:36,277
我忘不了你這美麗的東西

1554
00:45:38,516 --> 00:45:40,211
Z？

1555
00:45:40,585 --> 00:45:42,246
看看你

1556
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:45,412
25年了，你還是這麼帥

1557
00:45:45,623 --> 00:45:47,318
我吃素

1558
00:45:47,525 --> 00:45:51,291
看看你，你還是這麼心狠手辣

1559
00:45:51,629 --> 00:45:55,292
你好猛哦，聽著，我們都需要一樣東西

1560
00:45:58,202 --> 00:45:59,726
把他叫回來

1561
00:46:00,405 --> 00:46:01,497
想都別想

1562
00:46:01,673 --> 00:46:05,632
你忘了薩塔之光的秘密嗎？它午夜不離開地球就會爆炸…

1563
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,246
摧毀這小小的地球

1564
00:46:09,414 --> 00:46:13,282
我輸了你也玩完了，我贏了就一切照舊

1565
00:46:13,685 --> 00:46:17,644
你也不想把薩塔之光留下來

1566
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:21,952
好吧，塞琳娜

1567
00:46:23,261 --> 00:46:25,092
你贏了

1568
00:46:26,698 --> 00:46:30,031
Z？是你嗎？我可以當M探員

1569
00:46:30,401 --> 00:46:31,834
喂？

1570
00:46:42,347 --> 00:46:44,406
你真勇猛

1571
00:46:48,886 --> 00:46:52,549
回總部的捷徑是39街右轉

1572
00:46:52,757 --> 00:46:54,281
這兒右轉

1573
00:46:56,494 --> 00:46:58,223
下一條是37街

1574
00:46:58,396 --> 00:47:00,864
右轉，快右轉

1575
00:47:01,199 --> 00:47:02,757
我們不回總部

1576
00:47:02,934 --> 00:47:07,997
總部被佔領了，我們要回去大開殺戒

1577
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:09,799
還不行

1578
00:47:10,241 --> 00:47:13,699
你離開了五年，情況完全改變

1579
00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:16,972
我知道你一定很害怕，老實說我也有一點怕

1580
00:47:17,148 --> 00:47:19,207
-我才不害怕   -我也不怕

1581
00:47:19,784 --> 00:47:22,184
我只是想跟你談談心

1582
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:27,117
五年後你還是個菜鳥，你只會大開殺戒

1583
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:31,352
-怪不得Z要我回來   -是你搞砸了才找你回來的

1584
00:47:31,562 --> 00:47:34,258
你這種態度很沒有建設性

1585
00:47:34,432 --> 00:47:38,493
我才不聽你說教，現在MIB總部的麻煩大了

1586
00:47:38,670 --> 00:47:43,266
塞琳娜認為我知道東西的下落，所以她才佔領MIB總部

1587
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:45,500
守株待兔

1588
00:47:45,677 --> 00:47:48,237
所以我們不能硬闖進去

1589
00:47:48,413 --> 00:47:51,405
我們要有計劃，現在要去案發現場嗎？

1590
00:47:51,582 --> 00:47:55,780
-你是老大   -沒錯，那就左轉吧

1591
00:47:58,256 --> 00:48:00,747
我去找證人，跟她談談

1592
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:04,156
事情都不同了，我們以前都會消除證人的記憶

1593
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:07,225
是這樣啦...

1594
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:12,726
我本來....我會再問她話

1595
00:48:12,904 --> 00:48:14,563
-你要消除她的記憶   -什麼意思？

1596
00:48:14,739 --> 00:48:20,143
MIB行動手冊第773/I-1條款規定....

1597
00:48:21,145 --> 00:48:22,635
-把武器放下！   -住手！

1598
00:48:22,814 --> 00:48:24,406
J，對不起

1599
00:48:24,582 --> 00:48:27,517
我沒事，這是我的錯

1600
00:48:27,852 --> 00:48:30,320
K是我搭檔，勞拉是證人

1601
00:48:30,488 --> 00:48:31,614
幸會

1602
00:48:32,924 --> 00:48:37,452
謝謝你派探員來保護我

1603
00:48:37,662 --> 00:48:39,630
MIB第594-B條款規定…

1604
00:48:39,831 --> 00:48:42,994
探員不得進行其它服務......

1605
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:48,503
薩塔人班在這裏遇害，我猜兇手在這個方向

1606
00:48:48,673 --> 00:48:50,231
班

1607
00:48:50,408 --> 00:48:53,241
-五英尺七英吋、矮胖禿頭？   -你認識他？

1608
00:48:53,678 --> 00:48:55,908
不認識，我沒見過他

1609
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:58,981
好大的一條魚

1610
00:49:01,185 --> 00:49:02,982
等一下

1611
00:49:08,159 --> 00:49:09,558
你留下了線索？

1612
00:49:09,727 --> 00:49:13,720
以免我的接班人搞不清楚狀況

1613
00:49:13,931 --> 00:49:18,595
是你先把事情搞砸.....

1614
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:20,101
兩位

1615
00:49:22,006 --> 00:49:24,907
好，你指著什麼東西

1616
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:30,445
借過

1617
00:49:31,983 --> 00:49:33,575
太空人

1618
00:49:35,186 --> 00:49:36,346
J？

1619
00:49:36,821 --> 00:49:39,119
他在指…

1620
00:49:39,323 --> 00:49:41,291
他在指著…

1621
00:49:44,028 --> 00:49:45,825
誰會這麼放披薩盒？

1622
00:49:45,997 --> 00:49:49,831
這絕對不是亂放的，這是一個線索

1623
00:49:50,001 --> 00:49:51,491
這是箭頭

1624
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,904
-J？   -別耽誤我，K

1625
00:49:58,075 --> 00:50:01,704
我們找的東西在櫃子裏

1626
00:50:03,114 --> 00:50:06,174
用橄欖油泡的鮑魚罐頭

1627
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:12,086
希望我沒有耽誤你

1628
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:15,317
幹得好，夥伴

1629
00:50:15,526 --> 00:50:18,427
-我們要查出這是哪裏的鑰匙   -我知道

1630
00:50:18,729 --> 00:50:22,859
-還不行   -MIB第773條款規定--

1631
00:50:23,034 --> 00:50:26,231
我知道，可是她對我很重要

1632
00:50:26,838 --> 00:50:29,329
是我們，她能幫助我們

1633
00:50:30,007 --> 00:50:32,703
她不能留在這兒，他們會回來的

1634
00:50:35,413 --> 00:50:39,110
-你可以去找我朋友   -他們跟你一樣嗎？

1635
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:40,406
算是吧

1636
00:50:40,585 --> 00:50:42,143
老兄！

1637
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,811
-小心頭喔！   -怎麼樣？

1638
00:50:44,989 --> 00:50:48,254
大家好，MIB總部被佔領

1639
00:50:48,893 --> 00:50:50,224
-真衰   -衰斃了

1640
00:50:50,394 --> 00:50:54,421
-我要你們幫忙，這是勞拉   -嗨，勞拉！

1641
00:50:54,632 --> 00:50:56,293
小心點！

1642
00:50:56,467 --> 00:50:57,456
他們是蟲蟲

1643
00:50:57,635 --> 00:51:00,934
蟲蟲會讓你蠢蠢欲動

1644
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:04,438
-他們都這麼說   -我交過更糟的男友

1645
00:51:04,976 --> 00:51:07,570
他們偷了免稅商品被停職

1646
00:51:07,745 --> 00:51:10,543
-有人故意栽賊   -Z超怕蟲

1647
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:12,012
-K探員   -你回來了

1648
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:14,913
-聽說你掛了    -我們違規停車

1649
00:51:15,086 --> 00:51:16,986
好，勞拉對我很重要

1650
00:51:17,688 --> 00:51:21,283
她對我們的任務很重要

1651
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:25,395
-我要請你們替我照顧她   -我會好好的給她照顧

1652
00:51:25,596 --> 00:51:26,563
安啦！

1653
00:51:28,833 --> 00:51:31,597
-過來坐吧？   -你泡不到她啦

1654
00:51:31,769 --> 00:51:32,929
給我閉嘴！

1655
00:51:36,107 --> 00:51:38,803
這是我的通訊器，以防萬一

1656
00:51:42,446 --> 00:51:44,073
-上壘了   -這樣啊

1657
00:51:46,717 --> 00:51:50,517
-小心尼巴   -哪一個是尼巴？

1658
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:55,185
-哪一個是尼巴？   -喂，辣妹

1659
00:51:55,393 --> 00:51:59,557
那就是他，沒問題了，你很安全

1660
00:51:59,730 --> 00:52:01,698
千萬別睡著

1661
00:52:03,467 --> 00:52:05,128
來玩扭扭樂！

1662
00:52:07,138 --> 00:52:11,802
我再把你的計劃說一次，我被搞糊塗了

1663
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:15,878
你把薩塔之光的記憶消除，但是卻替自己留下線索

1664
00:52:16,047 --> 00:52:17,036
沒錯

1665
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:22,277
西裝口袋的照片指向一支鑰匙，它能打開中央車站的置物櫃

1666
00:52:22,453 --> 00:52:26,514
-置物櫃裏會有另一個線索    -這就是計劃

1667
00:52:28,993 --> 00:52:32,520
-我想把敵人搞得昏頭轉向    -大家都昏頭轉向了

1668
00:52:34,832 --> 00:52:39,166
-你不會耽誤我吧？   -誰的大腦在用過時軟體啊？

1669
00:52:39,337 --> 00:52:41,567
你去買兩杯咖啡吧？

1670
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:45,231
好哇，你要加什麼？   兩塊我拉的屎嗎？

1671
00:52:45,409 --> 00:52:48,810
我不想讓你受傷，退後一點

1672
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:52,438
拜託，快打開來吧

1673
00:52:57,021 --> 00:52:59,421
光明使者回來了

1674
00:52:59,623 --> 00:53:02,091
K萬歲！

1675
00:53:02,493 --> 00:53:06,327
K，你賜給我們光亮

1676
00:53:06,497 --> 00:53:09,364
原來你是置物櫃的救世主

1677
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:10,500
慈悲的主！

1678
00:53:10,701 --> 00:53:15,502
C18置物櫃的善良子民…

1679
00:53:15,673 --> 00:53:19,234
-我有沒有留下什麼？   -有，時光器

1680
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,072
它照亮了街道和我們的心

1681
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:26,706
-我一直在找這支手錶   -鐘樓不見了！

1682
00:53:26,884 --> 00:53:29,614
別急…我有辦法

1683
00:53:29,887 --> 00:53:33,015
鈦合金外殼、防水功能

1684
00:53:33,824 --> 00:53:36,349
-很炫吧？   -陌生人，你是誰？

1685
00:53:36,794 --> 00:53:38,352
J

1686
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:41,024
J萬歲！

1687
00:53:41,465 --> 00:53:43,490
J，你賜給我們光亮

1688
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:46,727
-J，你是我們的守護..    -走吧

1689
00:53:47,271 --> 00:53:49,432
-等等，十誡！   -那些碑文！

1690
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:52,633
碑文…碑文…

1691
00:53:52,810 --> 00:53:56,837
我們一直謹守誡律、和平相處

1692
00:53:57,014 --> 00:54:00,415
到外面傳道，讓他們得救

1693
00:54:00,584 --> 00:54:02,245
好心點，請倒帶

1694
00:54:02,420 --> 00:54:04,251
也就是心存善念…

1695
00:54:04,688 --> 00:54:07,088
反省過錯，這樣才能擁有美好未來

1696
00:54:07,291 --> 00:54:09,657
每星期三租兩卷算一卷

1697
00:54:09,794 --> 00:54:13,161
在這神聖的日子要有奉獻精神

1698
00:54:13,431 --> 00:54:14,455
每個星期三

1699
00:54:14,665 --> 00:54:18,465
大量的成人錄影帶在後面

1700
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:23,430
真夠誇張

1701
00:54:24,275 --> 00:54:26,539
-這卡片是怎麼回事？   -我不知道

1702
00:54:26,710 --> 00:54:28,200
-你為什麼留下手錶？   -為了提醒自己

1703
00:54:28,379 --> 00:54:29,778
-提醒什麼？   -我不記得

1704
00:54:29,947 --> 00:54:30,936
猜猜看

1705
00:54:31,115 --> 00:54:34,881
我們要在午夜之前，也就是還剩59分鐘去找到答案

1706
00:54:37,288 --> 00:54:41,418
我有個好點子，別去找這麼麻煩的線索…

1707
00:54:41,625 --> 00:54:45,755
拿兩把核融碳化槍攻回總部

1708
00:54:45,930 --> 00:54:48,091
謎底就快揭曉了

1709
00:54:48,265 --> 00:54:50,028
這張卡還有效嗎？

1710
00:54:51,669 --> 00:54:55,503
-它在我出生前就沒在用了   -我一直在出差

1711
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:58,005
-他有幾十億的累積里程數   -用得到才怪

1712
00:54:58,175 --> 00:55:02,202
我一直想去高棉，那兒的龍蝦大餐只要一塊錢

1713
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:07,916
航空公司卻不讓你在假日使用，我確定這一定是陰謀，我是說...

1714
00:55:08,085 --> 00:55:10,781
這上面有什麼資料？

1715
00:55:11,188 --> 00:55:13,122
你一直沒來租一卷帶子

1716
00:55:13,324 --> 00:55:16,657
你預留了，可是都沒來拿

1717
00:55:17,161 --> 00:55:19,595
-牛頓   -有一隻大老鼠卡在馬桶

1718
00:55:19,763 --> 00:55:24,029
衝不下去，要尿就尿在...

1719
00:55:27,238 --> 00:55:30,207
-你還敢說我有妄想癥？   -當然囉

1720
00:55:30,975 --> 00:55:36,436
兩位，我是店長牛頓，最近見過外星人嗎？

1721
00:55:36,614 --> 00:55:40,846
-你需要看心理醫生   -他看過了，沒有用

1722
00:55:41,018 --> 00:55:43,248
新的案子，是吧？

1723
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,854
第27集，薩塔之光

1724
00:55:47,424 --> 00:55:48,686
找到了

1725
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:53,091
夏拉，你這天才不該被關起來

1726
00:55:53,264 --> 00:55:57,223
乳臭未乾的J探員，逮到我在黑市兜售臭氧層

1727
00:55:57,401 --> 00:55:59,335
他們很怕溫室效應

1728
00:55:59,503 --> 00:56:03,064
我要一艘太空船，要比光速快三百倍

1729
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:05,208
辦到了你要什麼都行

1730
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:07,901
-把J交給我，就算扯平   -太好了

1731
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:11,147
午夜前要搞定

1732
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:18,914
垃圾桶，你有一項特別任務

1733
00:56:23,427 --> 00:56:26,191
牛頓…是你嗎？

1734
00:56:26,363 --> 00:56:28,831
對啦，媽，我跟朋友在一起

1735
00:56:29,033 --> 00:56:30,625
我好想跟你生寶寶

1736
00:56:30,801 --> 00:56:32,894
你要不要吃迷你披薩？

1737
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:36,931
要吃迷你披薩嗎？很好吃哦

1738
00:56:37,107 --> 00:56:40,304
就像培果加了披薩料

1739
00:56:40,477 --> 00:56:43,275
她還會撒起司粉

1740
00:56:43,447 --> 00:56:47,406
不過她老是手顫撒了太多

1741
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:54,183
不要，我們不吃

1742
00:56:54,391 --> 00:56:55,619
好吧

1743
00:56:57,361 --> 00:56:58,726
在這兒

1744
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:04,731
就是這卷

1745
00:57:05,035 --> 00:57:07,333
終於找到物證了

1746
00:57:07,571 --> 00:57:11,268
我在放之前有一個問題

1747
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,638
外星人幹嘛老愛探人屁眼？

1748
00:57:13,811 --> 00:57:17,713
他們穿越浩瀚星空就是為了....

1749
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:20,145
小子，快放

1750
00:57:20,317 --> 00:57:23,218
好啦，我只是問問嘛

1751
00:57:24,255 --> 00:57:27,816
這是一起「沒發生過」的事件…

1752
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:31,859
來自一個「不存在」的檔案

1753
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:38,258
1978年，五十年來薩塔人陷入苦戰

1754
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:40,198
很像斯皮爾伯格的作品

1755
00:57:40,371 --> 00:57:44,273
但他們有一個寶物，薩塔之星

1756
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:47,808
它擁有威力強大的能量…

1757
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:51,573
它可以讓薩塔人獲得勝利…

1758
00:57:51,749 --> 00:57:56,186
但落入敵手後果就不堪設想

1759
00:57:56,353 --> 00:58:00,449
一批薩塔人來到地球，首領是薩塔之光守護者…

1760
00:58:00,658 --> 00:58:02,125
勞拉

1761
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:04,584
勞拉公主

1762
00:58:04,928 --> 00:58:09,490
她求星際戰警把薩塔之光藏起來

1763
00:58:09,667 --> 00:58:12,033
但是他們不能干涉

1764
00:58:12,202 --> 00:58:13,430
不對

1765
00:58:14,138 --> 00:58:15,264
當時是晚上

1766
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:18,907
下著雨

1767
00:58:19,576 --> 00:58:20,975
算你聰明

1768
00:58:21,145 --> 00:58:25,707
如果塞琳娜搶走薩塔之光，我們的星球就會被毀滅

1769
00:58:26,350 --> 00:58:29,683
如果把薩塔之光藏在地球

1770
00:58:29,853 --> 00:58:33,186
地球就會受到威脅，我們別無選擇，必須保持中立

1771
00:58:33,424 --> 00:58:35,949
-東西在哪兒？   -我們要保持中立？

1772
00:58:36,193 --> 00:58:38,320
你要的話就去拿吧

1773
00:58:42,599 --> 00:58:44,089
不！

1774
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:15,528
這事件被歷史淹沒…

1775
00:59:15,699 --> 00:59:18,634
神秘的星際戰警…

1776
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:21,930
再次拯救地球.....

1777
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:24,701
我不該那麼做

1778
00:59:25,676 --> 00:59:28,110
你沒把它送走

1779
00:59:29,213 --> 00:59:30,646
你把它藏在這兒

1780
00:59:32,649 --> 00:59:34,048
蟲蟲族

1781
00:59:38,222 --> 00:59:41,020
你是牛頓的病友嗎？

1782
00:59:41,225 --> 00:59:45,662
-是的，請看這裏   -你想吃迷你披薩嗎？

1783
00:59:46,697 --> 00:59:48,324
記憶消除器

1784
00:59:49,366 --> 00:59:52,927
好了，先去買隱形眼鏡

1785
00:59:53,103 --> 00:59:55,401
你活像只四眼田雞

1786
00:59:55,572 --> 01:00:00,168
然後帶她去高棉吃龍蝦大餐，別只花一塊錢

1787
01:00:00,344 --> 01:00:03,643
你從高棉回來…

1788
01:00:03,814 --> 01:00:06,840
就搬出你老媽的家

1789
01:00:07,017 --> 01:00:09,417
-走吧   -你看來都快四十歲了

1790
01:00:09,586 --> 01:00:11,884
-J探員   -來了啦

1791
01:00:12,055 --> 01:00:16,048
對了，沒有外星人或MIB

1792
01:00:22,266 --> 01:00:25,463
-你想去高棉嗎？   -好啊

1793
01:00:27,604 --> 01:00:29,003
嘿，老媽？

1794
01:00:29,606 --> 01:00:31,699
通訊器，J

1795
01:00:32,576 --> 01:00:35,374
-勞拉，是我   -我們在玩扭扭樂

1796
01:00:35,546 --> 01:00:37,343
怎麼樣？

1797
01:00:37,514 --> 01:00:40,779
-別摸我屁股   -抱歉，我以為是你的臉

1798
01:00:40,951 --> 01:00:43,977
他們沒有脊椎，超會扭的

1799
01:00:44,154 --> 01:00:47,146
而且歐普拉不是來自芝加哥

1800
01:00:47,324 --> 01:00:50,487
她在芝加哥降落才對

1801
01:00:51,161 --> 01:00:53,652
-你戴著手鏈嗎？   -是啊

1802
01:00:53,864 --> 01:00:54,888
它在發亮嗎？

1803
01:01:00,037 --> 01:01:03,029
-它從來沒發亮過   -我們馬上趕到

1804
01:01:03,207 --> 01:01:04,731
通訊器，弗蘭克

1805
01:01:05,042 --> 01:01:10,571
快去地下C層解除封鎖狀態，我們要去蟲蟲家找薩塔之光

1806
01:01:10,747 --> 01:01:13,477
-收到了，J    -頭

1807
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:14,776
臭婊子

1808
01:01:14,952 --> 01:01:16,852
你怎麼不說我愛你？

1809
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:21,650
-他是隻狗耶，我才不愛它   -我是說那女孩，你喜歡她

1810
01:01:21,859 --> 01:01:24,953
所以你沒消除她的記憶，你對她產生感情

1811
01:01:25,162 --> 01:01:29,622
-就像你對勞拉一樣？   -我對她的感情讓地球陷入危機

1812
01:01:29,833 --> 01:01:33,098
我不想看到你犯同樣的錯

1813
01:01:33,270 --> 01:01:34,828
隨便啦

1814
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:40,437
勞拉？

1815
01:01:47,417 --> 01:01:48,441
該死

1816
01:01:52,890 --> 01:01:54,858
他們丟了一半小命

1817
01:01:56,093 --> 01:01:57,117
天啊

1818
01:01:58,262 --> 01:02:00,287
這一定會留下疤痕

1819
01:02:01,698 --> 01:02:03,529
-勞拉呢？   -在MIB總部

1820
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:06,828
-被雙頭人抓走了   -他們拿到手鏈

1821
01:02:07,004 --> 01:02:09,768
只剩39分鐘…

1822
01:02:09,940 --> 01:02:12,101
你們要振作一點

1823
01:02:12,843 --> 01:02:13,901
真是的

1824
01:02:15,312 --> 01:02:17,371
這樣好多了

1825
01:02:17,548 --> 01:02:20,278
-等一下   -讓我拿飲料

1826
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:22,475
塞琳娜幹嘛帶走勞拉？

1827
01:02:22,653 --> 01:02:23,813
她也要我

1828
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:27,286
-現在要怎麼處理？   -管它的，大開殺戒吧

1829
01:02:27,491 --> 01:02:29,686
-我們需要強大火力   -有

1830
01:02:41,638 --> 01:02:45,165
別緊張，我以前住這兒，我只是來拿點東西

1831
01:02:50,547 --> 01:02:52,139
好溫馨的家

1832
01:03:04,061 --> 01:03:05,289
拜拜

1833
01:03:15,138 --> 01:03:17,936
你們沒看到武器和四隻夜行蟲

1834
01:03:18,108 --> 01:03:20,838
你們要一輩子珍惜對方

1835
01:03:21,011 --> 01:03:24,970
搞不好半小時後世界就毀滅

1836
01:03:25,148 --> 01:03:27,810
小朋友多晚睡都沒關係…

1837
01:03:27,985 --> 01:03:30,613
盡量讓她多吃餅乾和糖果

1838
01:03:41,498 --> 01:03:45,801
4分鐘後發射

1839
01:03:46,503 --> 01:03:50,530
-太空船準備好了   -很好，送到卡洛琳星

1840
01:03:53,910 --> 01:03:55,138
好了嗎？

1841
01:03:55,312 --> 01:03:57,507
子彈上膛了

1842
01:03:57,681 --> 01:03:59,342
-你呢，小鬼？   -小鬼？

1843
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:02,542
我可是擊退了奎朗人

1844
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,883
奎朗人是出了名的遜，他們對著你丟雪球嗎？

1845
01:04:07,691 --> 01:04:09,158
你知道自己在幹嘛嗎？

1846
01:04:09,326 --> 01:04:12,261
我即將跟四條蟲和一名郵差…

1847
01:04:12,462 --> 01:04:15,727
對付全宇宙最兇狠的惡棍

1848
01:04:15,899 --> 01:04:17,161
等等！

1849
01:04:22,939 --> 01:04:25,237
總部被全面封鎖！

1850
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:29,436
我知道啦，整棟大樓都加壓，進出不得，我當然知道

1851
01:04:29,613 --> 01:04:31,638
才怪，蟲蟲，進攻！

1852
01:04:31,815 --> 01:04:33,112
收到

1853
01:04:39,790 --> 01:04:45,228
你們早該來了，大美女把裏面搞得天翻地覆

1854
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:08,847
我要大快朵頤了

1855
01:05:09,052 --> 01:05:12,988
到發射室，手鏈會顯示出發點

1856
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:15,158
-無論如何都別回來找我   -什麼意思？

1857
01:05:15,358 --> 01:05:17,986
千萬別回來找我

1858
01:05:22,265 --> 01:05:26,361
-蟲蟲們，開槍掩護我   -我好怕，不敢動

1859
01:05:36,046 --> 01:05:37,240
快去！

1860
01:05:47,991 --> 01:05:50,892
-帥哦   -找到7RD主控板

1861
01:05:51,061 --> 01:05:56,522
-切斷電源，別讓他們起飛   -不行，我好怕

1862
01:05:57,534 --> 01:06:00,128
-那兒哦   -沒有子彈

1863
01:06:00,303 --> 01:06:01,930
沒問題

1864
01:06:16,586 --> 01:06:18,486
很高興又見面了，K

1865
01:06:22,793 --> 01:06:24,761
-3分鐘後發射   -J！

1866
01:06:24,961 --> 01:06:27,156
3分鐘後發射

1867
01:06:27,664 --> 01:06:29,131
J，好久不見

1868
01:06:29,299 --> 01:06:31,790
夏拉，你的氣色真好

1869
01:06:31,968 --> 01:06:34,596
-五年沒見了   -五年又四十二天

1870
01:06:34,771 --> 01:06:37,140
蹲苦窖的日子我記得一清二楚

1871
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:42,043
你不該偷走臭氧層，我一分鐘後就來救你

1872
01:06:42,646 --> 01:06:45,240
你休想！

1873
01:06:45,415 --> 01:06:46,882
兩分鐘

1874
01:06:53,557 --> 01:06:55,354
這次可能要久一點

1875
01:06:58,161 --> 01:07:02,393
-我早該把你消滅掉   -你真的很愛勞拉

1876
01:07:02,566 --> 01:07:04,431
對吧？

1877
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:06,759
你這個癡心漢

1878
01:07:34,998 --> 01:07:37,057
2分鐘後發射

1879
01:07:39,002 --> 01:07:40,435
快逃吧，我不會有事

1880
01:07:41,238 --> 01:07:43,729
別胡說八道，我贏了耶

1881
01:07:43,907 --> 01:07:47,934
你這麼醜還有這麼多分身…

1882
01:07:48,111 --> 01:07:50,909
我要把你關進大牢，快投降吧！

1883
01:07:51,114 --> 01:07:52,979
我要把你碎屍萬段

1884
01:08:13,103 --> 01:08:15,697
-哇靠   -他差點沒命

1885
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:17,635
超誇張的！

1886
01:08:17,807 --> 01:08:20,435
-該怎麼切斷電源呀？   -我不知道

1887
01:08:26,483 --> 01:08:30,385
-我沒事，我馬上就來   -想都別想

1888
01:08:36,526 --> 01:08:38,687
只剩一個了！

1889
01:08:48,204 --> 01:08:50,570
30秒後發射

1890
01:08:58,682 --> 01:09:01,048
15秒後發射

1891
01:09:03,954 --> 01:09:06,081
10秒後發射

1892
01:09:06,423 --> 01:09:07,617
8

1893
01:09:07,824 --> 01:09:09,121
7

1894
01:09:09,326 --> 01:09:10,691
6

1895
01:09:10,827 --> 01:09:12,158
5

1896
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:13,421
4

1897
01:09:13,630 --> 01:09:14,722
3

1898
01:09:14,931 --> 01:09:16,023
2

1899
01:09:17,534 --> 01:09:19,468
發射中止

1900
01:09:19,936 --> 01:09:23,394
-別小看我，我絕不逃命   -他搶走你的槍

1901
01:09:23,573 --> 01:09:26,406
K你的腦袋，把你摔得慘兮兮

1902
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:30,637
-你被打到滿地爬   -這是苦肉計

1903
01:09:31,348 --> 01:09:33,816
你輸了

1904
01:09:33,984 --> 01:09:37,044
你白白浪費我20年的時間？

1905
01:09:37,287 --> 01:09:41,314
薩塔星還是會被摧毀，都是你一時心軟

1906
01:09:41,524 --> 01:09:45,722
你這軟骨頭，快投降吧

1907
01:09:45,895 --> 01:09:49,456
-你能阻止我嗎？   -我不能，他能

1908
01:09:51,501 --> 01:09:53,799
你的班機被取消了

1909
01:10:00,510 --> 01:10:04,947
切斷電源、切斷電源，好多按鈕哦，我用猜的…

1910
01:10:05,115 --> 01:10:06,241
對啦

1911
01:10:08,318 --> 01:10:10,582
-蟲蟲！   -抱歉

1912
01:10:15,692 --> 01:10:18,286
-把手鏈給我   -我要跟你去

1913
01:10:18,495 --> 01:10:21,191
大家上車
都上車

1914
01:10:34,377 --> 01:10:37,244
薩塔之光竟然是這條手鏈？

1915
01:10:37,414 --> 01:10:39,143
有時候小東西也很重要

1916
01:10:39,315 --> 01:10:42,978
手鏈只會顯示出發點

1917
01:10:43,153 --> 01:10:45,348
11分鐘後趕不到那兒…

1918
01:10:45,522 --> 01:10:48,582
手鏈就會爆炸，摧毀地球

1919
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:50,225
什麼？

1920
01:10:50,860 --> 01:10:51,827
你們好

1921
01:10:52,862 --> 01:10:54,386
-慢著   -我搞得定啦

1922
01:11:09,879 --> 01:11:10,868
可惡

1923
01:11:12,582 --> 01:11:15,779
-這輛車有高速功能！   -繫好安全帶

1924
01:11:19,189 --> 01:11:20,213
這是什麼？

1925
01:11:20,423 --> 01:11:23,790
高速操控器，用來控制方向

1926
01:11:28,064 --> 01:11:33,127
用開關切換左右副翼，用搖桿控制升降和速度

1927
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:39,371
我要你知道......

1928
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:41,669
等一下再跟我說

1929
01:11:45,248 --> 01:11:46,909
幫我接總部

1930
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:52,077
我跟她說，臭婊子聽好了，你不想被我踢爆屁股的話…

1931
01:11:52,255 --> 01:11:56,123
-就給我乖乖滾蛋   -弗蘭克，你在哪兒？

1932
01:11:56,326 --> 01:11:57,759
指揮大廳

1933
01:11:57,927 --> 01:12:00,794
我們遭到攻擊，K，快按紅鈕

1934
01:12:00,964 --> 01:12:04,866
總部，鎖定目標，我教你

1935
01:12:07,103 --> 01:12:11,767
J，弗蘭克，你是一隻狗的最好搭檔

1936
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:13,837
安息吧

1937
01:12:15,311 --> 01:12:16,335
弗蘭克？

1938
01:12:17,347 --> 01:12:20,009
啟動自動駕駛

1939
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:26,449
-這不是自動駕駛   -高速飛行時不管用

1940
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:30,057
-我要的是方向盤！   -隻有這玩意

1941
01:12:31,828 --> 01:12:34,763
-你沒打過遊戲機嗎？   -什麼遊戲機？

1942
01:12:34,931 --> 01:12:36,421
遜斃了，走開

1943
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:40,132
喂，那可不是搖桿！

1944
01:12:52,115 --> 01:12:54,106
直接向下

1945
01:12:58,821 --> 01:13:00,220
白癡

1946
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:13,098
你進隧道甩不掉她的

1947
01:13:15,471 --> 01:13:16,938
-他在哪兒？   -他？

1948
01:13:17,340 --> 01:13:18,637
傑夫，坐好了！

1949
01:13:20,944 --> 01:13:21,933
哎呀

1950
01:13:23,146 --> 01:13:24,272
大鋼牙

1951
01:13:58,214 --> 01:14:01,206
快來不及了，薩塔之光呢？

1952
01:14:02,418 --> 01:14:03,908
在這兒

1953
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:07,151
-什麼？   -我就是薩塔之光？

1954
01:14:08,091 --> 01:14:10,616
-不可能   -你要去救一個星球

1955
01:14:10,827 --> 01:14:13,295
你搞錯了，我在披薩店打工

1956
01:14:13,463 --> 01:14:17,399
兩天前我還是個郵差，你不能否定你的本性

1957
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:20,694
你就是薩塔之光

1958
01:14:20,870 --> 01:14:24,601
薩塔人的精神領袖和救星

1959
01:14:24,774 --> 01:14:27,470
你有力量拯救星球

1960
01:14:27,644 --> 01:14:32,581
我一直在保護你，你辦得到的

1961
01:14:36,419 --> 01:14:40,185
現在你要去拯救家園

1962
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,449
-我是天秤座   -你是薩塔人

1963
01:14:42,659 --> 01:14:46,857
-你難過時總會下雨   -很多人在下雨的時候都會難過

1964
01:14:47,163 --> 01:14:49,859
會下雨是因為你難過

1965
01:15:43,086 --> 01:15:44,678
這不公平

1966
01:15:50,626 --> 01:15:52,184
這就是人生

1967
01:15:53,996 --> 01:15:55,623
這是你的本性…

1968
01:15:55,798 --> 01:15:58,289
人不能忘本

1969
01:16:07,710 --> 01:16:10,270
傑夫，我沒心情罵你！

1970
01:16:10,446 --> 01:16:12,175
給我回地鐵隧道去！馬上！

1971
01:16:18,721 --> 01:16:19,983
情況不妙

1972
01:16:21,891 --> 01:16:23,381
等等

1973
01:16:24,827 --> 01:16:26,158
J！

1974
01:16:26,763 --> 01:16:31,200
你一定要立刻上船

1975
01:16:32,602 --> 01:16:34,900
勞拉，你非走不可

1976
01:16:35,338 --> 01:16:36,703
哎喲，天啊

1977
01:16:38,741 --> 01:16:41,539
他不會有事，這算小意思

1978
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:43,873
不行！

1979
01:16:46,249 --> 01:16:49,150
小心我扁你

1980
01:16:49,552 --> 01:16:51,884
勞拉，這是你的使命

1981
01:16:52,121 --> 01:16:54,055
我在說話耶！

1982
01:16:55,591 --> 01:16:57,684
不准咬人

1983
01:16:59,462 --> 01:17:01,862
你不走我們都會死

1984
01:17:05,067 --> 01:17:07,627
你跟你媽一樣美

1985
01:17:14,343 --> 01:17:16,607
幫幫忙，K？

1986
01:17:29,025 --> 01:17:30,083
K？

1987
01:17:31,961 --> 01:17:34,452
麻煩用大一點的槍

1988
01:18:01,057 --> 01:18:02,615
-小子？   -幹嘛

1989
01:18:03,125 --> 01:18:06,424
-謝謝你把我帶回來   -不客氣

1990
01:18:07,029 --> 01:18:08,519
你怎麼不早說？

1991
01:18:08,731 --> 01:18:10,824
你會讓她走嗎？

1992
01:18:32,288 --> 01:18:36,156
當平凡人的感覺如何？不必每天出生入死

1993
01:18:36,359 --> 01:18:37,758
還不賴

1994
01:18:37,927 --> 01:18:41,727
週末睡懶覺，看氣象頻道

1995
01:18:45,234 --> 01:18:47,361
不過我很想念大城市

1996
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:52,131
勞拉是勞拉公主的女兒

1997
01:18:54,043 --> 01:18:57,410
-你們有沒有.....？   -MIB總部一團糟，走吧

1998
01:18:58,214 --> 01:18:59,442
走？

1999
01:18:59,615 --> 01:19:03,881
成千上萬人看到這一場好戲

2000
01:19:04,053 --> 01:19:08,456
我們要想出周詳的計劃  你在.....？

2001
01:19:13,095 --> 01:19:15,063
你還有得學呢

2002
01:19:15,231 --> 01:19:16,721
我也要那玩意

2003
01:19:16,933 --> 01:19:18,195
媽的！

2004
01:19:23,039 --> 01:19:24,233
-喂   -喂

2005
01:19:24,407 --> 01:19:26,841
-你還好吧？   -我很好

2006
01:19:27,009 --> 01:19:31,537
那就好，大家都碰過這種事，馬子跑了你很傷心，想聊嗎？

2007
01:19:31,714 --> 01:19:33,272
-不想   -我可以幫忙

2008
01:19:33,449 --> 01:19:34,438
不要

2009
01:19:34,617 --> 01:19:35,675
你還在難過嗎？

2010
01:19:35,851 --> 01:19:36,840
-沒有啊   -是啊

2011
01:19:37,019 --> 01:19:41,251
你想念她，誰不會呢？我泡過一個性感辣妹

2012
01:19:41,457 --> 01:19:44,984
我們用各種姿勢翻雲覆雨.....

2013
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:46,491
拜託！

2014
01:19:46,929 --> 01:19:48,794
別來這套，很噁心耶！

2015
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:50,893
女孩子最善變了

2016
01:19:51,067 --> 01:19:54,628
她們要你舔耳朵其實是想

2017
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:56,464
搞什麼，弗蘭克！

2018
01:19:56,672 --> 01:19:59,368
還在難過嗎？需要建議嗎？

2019
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:01,442
我不要建議

2020
01:20:01,611 --> 01:20:03,169
也不想聊天

2021
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:05,076
尤其是你

2022
01:20:05,247 --> 01:20:07,909
拜託，我好得很

2023
01:20:08,884 --> 01:20:11,682
J萬歲！

2024
01:20:12,221 --> 01:20:15,816
-我從中央車站把他們帶來   -你幹嘛放在我的櫃子？

2025
01:20:16,025 --> 01:20:18,323
我只是想讓你開心一下

2026
01:20:18,494 --> 01:20:21,190
K，他們很可憐耶，我們得放他們出去

2027
01:20:21,364 --> 01:20:24,561
讓他們知道外面世界很大

2028
01:20:24,734 --> 01:20:26,224
你還是搞不清狀況
