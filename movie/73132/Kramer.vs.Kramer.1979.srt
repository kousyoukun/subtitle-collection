00:01:57,959 --> 00:01:59,824
I love you, Billy.

7
00:02:03,765 --> 00:02:06,097
I love you too, Mommy.

8
00:02:12,473 --> 00:02:13,838
Night-night.

9
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,377
Sleep tight.

10
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,806
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

11
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:29,011
I'll see you in the morning light.

12
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,528
I love you.

13
00:03:03,591 --> 00:03:06,059
They're going to make me an assistant art director.

14
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:06,818
So Kenny says:

15
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:09,552
''You get yourself a Burberry coat.

16
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:13,426
lf you're gonna be Madison Avenue, you have to look it.''

17
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:16,228
Saturday afternoon, I go out, and it's cold.

18
00:03:16,504 --> 00:03:19,496
l go to this place that specializes in Burberrys...

19
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:22,505
...and say, ''l want a Burberry coat, 37 short.''

20
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,611
They put it on, and I look beautiful in it.

21
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,040
l say, ''I'll buy it.''

22
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,443
And right then, I start to sweat.

23
00:03:29,717 --> 00:03:33,744
l take my checkbook out, start to sign the check, and my hand shakes...

24
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:35,784
...because l'm so scared.

25
00:03:36,057 --> 00:03:37,524
-Good night. -Where you going?

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:41,593
-l gotta get home. -Oh, Jesus, I gotta go.

27
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,127
Okay, so let me finish.

28
00:03:43,397 --> 00:03:45,922
So I sign it, and my hand starts shaking....

29
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:51,030
Who is this? Danny, right? Taxi!

30
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,606
-Come on, I gotta tell you something. -l can't. I gotta get home.

31
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,539
Gotta talk to you about something important.

32
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:02,272
l'm putting you in charge of the Mid-Atlantic account.

33
00:04:24,071 --> 00:04:27,199
By the end of the year, we'll have them up to 1 0 million.

34
00:04:27,408 --> 00:04:30,639
lf this campaign works out the way l know it will...

35
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:32,777
...they'll offer me a partnership.

36
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,413
That's terrific!

37
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:38,915
When that happens, I just want you to know l'm taking you along.

38
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:44,247
Wow! Wow! That's terrific.

39
00:05:01,809 --> 00:05:03,800
Joanna.

40
00:05:04,378 --> 00:05:06,107
l'm home.

41
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,516
l forgot my keys. I gotta call the office before they go.

42
00:05:12,787 --> 00:05:16,279
Jo, you're gonna be real proud of me. I got good news.

43
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:21,694
-Ted. -One second. Let me just do this.

44
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:28,631
You know Jack Edwards in accounting? He committed suicide.

45
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,963
Yeah, hi. Ted Kramer.

46
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:35,073
l gotta get those photos from the retoucher by tomorrow morning.

47
00:05:35,309 --> 00:05:38,005
-l'm leaving you. -Honey, please. I can't hear.

48
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,513
Okay, you too. Thanks a lot. See you tomorrow.

49
00:05:43,184 --> 00:05:44,583
Did you guys eat?

50
00:05:44,852 --> 00:05:45,750
l'm leaving you.

51
00:05:48,856 --> 00:05:50,653
Here are my keys.

52
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:53,986
Here's my American Express, my Bloomingdale's card...

53
00:05:54,195 --> 00:05:58,063
...my checkbook. l've taken $2000 out of our savings account.

54
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,530
That's what I had when we first got married.

55
00:06:00,768 --> 00:06:03,532
-ls this a joke? -Here's the cleaning, laundry ticket.

56
00:06:03,771 --> 00:06:05,932
You can pick them both up on Saturday.

57
00:06:06,173 --> 00:06:08,664
-You. You have to pick them up. -What's wrong?

58
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,710
l paid the rent, the Con Ed bill, and the phone bill, so--

59
00:06:12,947 --> 00:06:14,744
You really pick your times to....

60
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,788
l'm sorry I was late, but I was busy making a living, all right?

61
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,856
Come on, okay? Can we stop now?

62
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:29,255
So that's everything.

63
00:06:34,468 --> 00:06:36,129
Enough, enough. All right?

64
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,428
What are you doing?

65
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:42,266
Where are you going? Just tell me what I did that's so terrible.

66
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:43,907
-lt's not you. -Then what?

67
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,136
lt's me. lt's my fault.

68
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,104
You married the wrong person.

69
00:06:48,316 --> 00:06:50,784
-l can't hack it. -Let's just go inside.

70
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:53,111
l can't, I tried. l swear--

71
00:06:53,387 --> 00:06:56,220
Joanna, please, just-- l'm sorry.

72
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:01,587
-No, please don't make me go in there. -l just want to talk.

73
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:04,389
lf you do, I swear, one day...

74
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,123
-...I'll go right out the window. -Oh, please.

75
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:09,665
Come on, now. What about Billy?

76
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:17,008
l'm not taking him with me. l'm no good for him.

77
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,944
l'm terrible with him.

78
00:07:19,246 --> 00:07:22,010
l have no patience.

79
00:07:22,249 --> 00:07:24,308
He's better off without me.

80
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,987
Joanna, please.

81
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:35,158
And I don't love you anymore.

82
00:07:37,164 --> 00:07:39,155
-Where are you going? -l don't know.

83
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,866
Hi, Margaret. This is Ted. ls my wife there?

84
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:20,234
Yeah. Joanna come in?

85
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:24,807
We had a little fight. I thought she might have stopped by.

86
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:28,345
lf she comes in, tell her to come up or just give me a ring.

87
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:34,381
Don't worry. She didn't take her suitcase. She won't get very far.

88
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,889
l got work to do. lf she comes in, tell her to call me.

89
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,524
lt's about time.

90
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,438
Joanna, that's the most insensitive-- Hi, Margaret.

91
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:57,541
-She packed a suitcase? -Look, it's nothing serious, really.

92
00:08:57,778 --> 00:08:59,746
She tell you where she was going?

93
00:09:00,014 --> 00:09:02,744
-You tell me. -How would I know? I wasn't here.

94
00:09:03,017 --> 00:09:06,509
Clearly, you two had many talks about my shortcomings...

95
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,746
...which I haven't been privy to. And l'd love to talk...

96
00:09:10,024 --> 00:09:13,255
...but I have a major presentation in the morning...

97
00:09:13,527 --> 00:09:16,360
...and I gotta get my work done. So please allow me--

98
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,225
You don't realize we have a serious problem.

99
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:22,402
Wrong. Me. I got the problem. All you gotta do is...

100
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:25,036
...go out the door and go back to bed.

101
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:27,964
-The fact is-- -For six months...

102
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:31,803
...l've been spitting blood to get this agency its biggest account.

103
00:09:32,079 --> 00:09:34,138
And at five, we got it.

104
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:39,442
At eight, the vice president tells me I'll be the next creative director.

105
00:09:39,653 --> 00:09:42,247
l come through this door to share with my wife...

106
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:46,222
...one of the five best days of my life, and she looks at me...

107
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,054
...and tells me she doesn't want to live with me!

108
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:57,162
Can't you understand what she's done to me?

109
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,632
She loused up one of the five best days of your life.

110
00:10:06,514 --> 00:10:08,914
You're terrific. Boy, you're....

111
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,141
Thanks very much, really.

112
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,344
Sisterhood.

113
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:16,818
Thank you for coming to cheer me up, but--

114
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,126
l didn't come to cheer you up.

115
00:10:19,426 --> 00:10:21,291
l'm concerned about Joanna.

116
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,321
Maybe you can be concerned in the privacy of your own apartment.

117
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:30,667
Joanna and I never had any problems until you and Charley split up.

118
00:10:30,938 --> 00:10:32,872
Oh, I don't believe you.

119
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,937
Just tell me the truth, okay?

120
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,837
Did you set her up to this?

121
00:10:37,111 --> 00:10:39,011
No, I didn't put her up to this.

122
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,714
-Give her a little pep talk? -No, I didn't.

123
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:43,940
Joanna and I talk a great deal.

124
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:46,312
And Joanna is a very unhappy woman.

125
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:51,048
And it took a lot of courage for her to walk out of here.

126
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:54,318
How much courage does it take to walk out on your kid?

127
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:10,035
Where's Mommy?

128
00:12:10,304 --> 00:12:11,896
-What? -Where's Mommy?

129
00:12:12,139 --> 00:12:13,572
What time is it?

130
00:12:14,808 --> 00:12:19,643
The little hand's on the 7, the big hand's on the 9. Where's Mommy?

131
00:12:21,482 --> 00:12:26,545
Oh, God. Okay, l'm gonna tell you. You want to know where Mommy is?

132
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:30,086
-She's supposed to take me to school. -She told me to do it.

133
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,259
Okay, I'll tell you where she went.

134
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:36,225
You know when you and your friends don't get along and fight?

135
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,990
And you want to go and be alone for a while?

136
00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,895
Sometimes Mommy and Daddy don't get along...

137
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:45,902
...and one of them wants to go and be by themselves for a while.

138
00:12:46,106 --> 00:12:48,438
-When is Mommy coming back? -Soon.

139
00:12:48,676 --> 00:12:52,168
Now we are gonna have breakfast! Okay? Just you and me.

140
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,573
-What do you want? -French toast.

141
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,973
You want French toast, you got it.

142
00:12:57,184 --> 00:13:00,347
Put up a little water for Daddy to have some coffee.

143
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,613
We got how many eggs? Two for you and two for me.

144
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:04,915
We got milk.

145
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,626
We got butter.

146
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,624
We got $5.

147
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,320
l got $5. Here, you sit here.

148
00:13:12,132 --> 00:13:14,930
Okay, can you be my number one helper?

149
00:13:16,704 --> 00:13:17,932
Watch this. One hand.

150
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:20,105
Here we go.

151
00:13:20,307 --> 00:13:23,174
Did you know that all the best chefs are men?

152
00:13:23,377 --> 00:13:26,540
lsn't this terrific? We gotta do this more often.

153
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,271
-You dropped some shell in it. -That's okay.

154
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:33,119
Makes it crunchier. You like it crunchy, don't you?

155
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,188
Why don't you beat them, and I'll get everything else going.

156
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:39,392
-What time is school? -8:30.

157
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,823
Gotta get the show on the road. l gotta shower, shave and shampoo.

158
00:13:44,064 --> 00:13:45,190
l got people to see.

159
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,959
And Daddy's gotta bring home the bacon...

160
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:49,669
...and he's gotta cook it.

161
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:53,062
We're having a good time! Where does Mommy keep the--?

162
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,667
-ln the stove. -The pan. The stove.

163
00:13:57,911 --> 00:13:59,538
First, we need a nice fire.

164
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,474
No, you're not doing it right.

165
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:06,152
Look, you gotta do it fast. See? lt's the wrist.

166
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,252
So the gucky part dissolves.

167
00:14:08,489 --> 00:14:12,323
Then you take the bread, and we....

168
00:14:12,526 --> 00:14:14,221
We....

169
00:14:15,162 --> 00:14:18,325
We fold the French toast. That's what we do.

170
00:14:18,565 --> 00:14:22,057
-l think you forgot milk. -l didn't. Milk comes last.

171
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:25,999
When you're having a good time you forget things.

172
00:14:26,707 --> 00:14:29,938
l just wanted to see if you're paying attention.

173
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,936
Fun, isn't it? When's the last time Mommy let you in the kitchen?

174
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,681
l don't like it in pieces.

175
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:40,012
lt tastes the same whether it's in pieces or whole. Bread is bread.

176
00:14:40,354 --> 00:14:42,686
Besides, French toast is always folded.

177
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:46,120
ln the best restaurants, you see folded French toast.

178
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,291
You get more bites that way.

179
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,361
And while that's going, Daddy's gonna make coffee.

180
00:14:53,634 --> 00:14:55,192
You having a good time?

181
00:14:55,402 --> 00:14:59,031
l don't remember the last time I had such a good time.

182
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,805
Daddy's gonna make himself coffee.

183
00:15:02,075 --> 00:15:04,475
-That's too much! -No, I like it strong.

184
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:06,872
Mommy always makes it too weak.

185
00:15:09,082 --> 00:15:11,050
Can I have some orange juice?

186
00:15:11,885 --> 00:15:14,217
Right. One OJ coming up for the kid.

187
00:15:16,723 --> 00:15:18,156
Daddy, it's burning!

188
00:15:18,992 --> 00:15:20,619
-What? -lt's burning!

189
00:15:22,563 --> 00:15:25,555
Damn it! Goddamn her!

190
00:15:28,669 --> 00:15:30,466
Oh, shit.

191
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,439
Just take it easy. Everything is fine. We're terrific.

192
00:15:36,677 --> 00:15:38,144
Just....

193
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:42,744
Just take it easy. Nothing is the matter.

194
00:15:46,453 --> 00:15:47,852
-What? -Your hand's sweaty.

195
00:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,646
-When's Mommy coming back? -Soon. I told you.

196
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:54,257
-ls she gonna pick me up? -Probably. lf she doesn't, I will.

197
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,360
-What if you forget? -l won't.

198
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,929
-What if you get run over? -Mommy will pick you up.

199
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,328
-Miss! What grade are you in? -First.

200
00:16:02,536 --> 00:16:05,096
This is Billy Kramer. He's in first grade.

201
00:16:05,305 --> 00:16:07,705
Take care of him. I gotta get a taxi, l'm late. Taxi!

202
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:09,942
Taxi!

203
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,546
-Congratulations about Mid-Atlantic. -Thanks.

204
00:16:15,816 --> 00:16:19,217
-Congratulations. -ls the stuff back from the retoucher?

205
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:21,785
-Great news, Ted. -Thanks a lot.

206
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,490
Morning. 1 1 :00, meeting with Airwick--

207
00:16:24,725 --> 00:16:27,990
-Where's the stuff from the retoucher? -Right here.

208
00:16:28,662 --> 00:16:30,061
-Did my wife call? -No.

209
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,629
You're gonna have to cancel the Airwick at 1 1 :30.

210
00:17:04,831 --> 00:17:08,062
She's never gone this far before, but in the past...

211
00:17:08,335 --> 00:17:11,168
...l've known when she's upset because...

212
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,066
...she gets very quiet.

213
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:16,867
Our pattern has been that l've said, ''What's the matter?''...

214
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,942
...and she'll kind of sit on it.

215
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:22,272
But in the last few weeks, maybe couple of months...

216
00:17:22,516 --> 00:17:26,452
...since we've been going crazy with this account, l've been remiss.

217
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:32,056
And I just didn't look at the writing on the wall, so she's kind of--

218
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:36,188
l think this is a way of making me stop, look and say:

219
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,557
''l'm as important as your work.''

220
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,892
ls there another guy?

221
00:17:44,905 --> 00:17:47,635
l don't think so. She's not the type.

222
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:50,774
She's got this friend, Margaret, downstairs...

223
00:17:51,478 --> 00:17:55,778
...you know, women's lib. l think they may have cooked this up.

224
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:57,875
lt worked.

225
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:00,652
l'm going crazy!

226
00:18:00,887 --> 00:18:03,082
Look, not to worry.

227
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,882
She'll be back.

228
00:18:05,092 --> 00:18:07,458
l didn't know it would happen to me!

229
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:09,986
Don't let it get you down.

230
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,666
l know she'll be back. l'm terrific, really.

231
00:18:16,269 --> 00:18:19,136
-You do have a problem, Ted. -Yeah, what's that?

232
00:18:22,009 --> 00:18:23,943
What are you gonna do about Billy?

233
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:29,638
This just happened last night. l'm sure when Joanna comes back--

234
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,111
lt's none of my business. I'll butt out.

235
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,947
Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.

236
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:38,351
l appreciate you taking the time to talk to me.

237
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:43,188
May sound a little rough, but...

238
00:18:43,463 --> 00:18:47,695
...l think you ought to send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while.

239
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,659
You mean, until Joanna comes back?

240
00:18:51,471 --> 00:18:53,769
Suppose Joanna doesn't come back?

241
00:18:57,044 --> 00:18:58,773
Gee, I don't know....

242
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,536
Ted, listen to me.

243
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:06,116
l just told the boys upstairs you're handling the Mid-Atlantic account.

244
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:10,881
You know? A gig like that comes along once every five, six years.

245
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,457
There's guys here eating their hearts out because I gave that spot to you.

246
00:19:15,662 --> 00:19:19,063
This is important. Don't blow this.

247
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:23,132
l gotta depend on you. I gotta count on you for 1 1 0 percent...

248
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:27,731
...7 days a week, 24 hours a day. l gotta have that.

249
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:31,477
l can't be concerned about you worrying about a kid.

250
00:19:31,812 --> 00:19:35,680
First, you can count on me 25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

251
00:19:35,882 --> 00:19:37,747
Because l'm not a loser, Jim.

252
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:40,885
l never let anything at home come into the office.

253
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:43,418
You asked me to unload in this office.

254
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:47,353
When I go outside, l'm on top of it. l want you to know that.

255
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:50,029
l'm a survivor.

256
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:54,064
You've given me a shot here. l'm not gonna let anything blow it.

257
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,934
Okay?

258
00:19:59,272 --> 00:20:02,173
Let's have a drink later. l'm all right. I gotta...

259
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,707
...blow smoke up Airwick's ass, 1 1 :00.

260
00:20:04,911 --> 00:20:06,572
l'm all right!

261
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,247
You don't worry.

262
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:09,847
Thank you.

263
00:20:10,851 --> 00:20:13,012
l love you, you bastard.

264
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:20,554
Daddy?

265
00:20:20,794 --> 00:20:22,591
Daddy?

266
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,463
Yeah, honey, just wait a second. l just want to finish this idea.

267
00:20:29,736 --> 00:20:32,466
Let me get this copy done, and then I'll talk.

268
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:37,039
What time is it when an elephant sits on your fence?

269
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:40,539
Time to get a new fence.

270
00:20:43,984 --> 00:20:46,646
Honey, please-- l just got this sentence.

271
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:48,315
Daddy! Daddy!

272
00:20:49,222 --> 00:20:50,553
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

273
00:20:50,757 --> 00:20:53,988
Get over there and sit on that couch and don't move!

274
00:20:54,261 --> 00:20:56,923
l knew this was gonna happen! l knew it!

275
00:20:57,164 --> 00:21:00,725
Who told you not to drink this stuff here?

276
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:02,901
-Sorry. -Yeah, you're sorry.

277
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:05,799
Told you to keep that juice in the dining room!

278
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,834
Sorry.

279
00:21:08,775 --> 00:21:11,938
Who took you to the park, gave you everything you wanted?

280
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:14,409
-Who bought you an ice cream? -You.

281
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:18,641
And who promised Daddy that when we got home, you'd let him work?

282
00:21:20,086 --> 00:21:23,283
-That's ruined. I can't fix that. -Sorry.

283
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:32,094
lt's past your bedtime. Why don't you go to sleep?

284
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:40,365
And brush your teeth and flush the toilet.

285
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,781
-Paper towels. What else? -We need detergent.

286
00:21:49,015 --> 00:21:50,039
All right.

287
00:21:50,283 --> 00:21:53,548
No, Mommy buys the kind with the orange circles on it.

288
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,812
-There's no difference. -Mom said it was the best.

289
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:03,359
-Let's go. -Get the pink stuff.

290
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:06,962
All right, come on.

291
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,794
Okay. That's it.

292
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,964
We need some cereal.

293
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,402
Okay, what color?

294
00:22:25,151 --> 00:22:27,517
Hey, Billy!

295
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,179
Billy! Told you Mommy would write before the week was up.

296
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:35,427
-When is she coming back? -That's what we're gonna find out now.

297
00:22:36,496 --> 00:22:39,192
Okay. Let's read it.

298
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:47,735
''My dearest, sweet Billy.''

299
00:22:50,343 --> 00:22:51,901
That's you.

300
00:22:54,214 --> 00:22:56,273
''Mommy has gone away.

301
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:59,017
Sometimes in the world...

302
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:00,550
...daddies go away...

303
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:03,414
...and mommies bring up their little boys.

304
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:06,557
But sometimes, a mommy can go away too...

305
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:09,887
...and you have your daddy to bring you up.

306
00:23:10,196 --> 00:23:12,460
l have gone away because I must find...

307
00:23:12,699 --> 00:23:16,567
...something interesting to do for myself in the world.

308
00:23:16,803 --> 00:23:19,465
Everybody has to, and so do l.

309
00:23:23,376 --> 00:23:27,972
Being your mommy was one thing, but there are other things too...

310
00:23:28,248 --> 00:23:31,240
...and this is what I have to do.

311
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:33,885
l did not get a chance to tell you this...

312
00:23:34,154 --> 00:23:36,884
...and that is why l'm writing you now.

313
00:23:37,123 --> 00:23:39,648
l will always be your mommy...

314
00:23:41,261 --> 00:23:43,661
...and I will always love you.

315
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,888
l just won't be your mommy in the house...

316
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,660
...but I'll be your mommy at the heart.

317
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:54,171
And now I must go and be the person I have to be.''

318
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:01,338
We'll read this another time.

319
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:03,014
l don't care.

320
00:25:14,487 --> 00:25:16,387
-Good night, Jim. -Come on in.

321
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,918
-Have a drink. -l can't, l'm late now.

322
00:25:19,159 --> 00:25:22,890
What's the rush? We're having a party for Norman. Five years here.

323
00:25:23,096 --> 00:25:24,188
Can you believe it?

324
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:27,195
Wish I could, but l'm late. l gotta pick up Billy.

325
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,368
You know Jerry Hoover, in media?

326
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,495
Tell you something funny.

327
00:25:31,704 --> 00:25:33,331
Gotta go. See you Monday.

328
00:25:38,611 --> 00:25:40,238
Taxi!

329
00:25:41,114 --> 00:25:42,604
Taxi!

330
00:25:45,785 --> 00:25:48,345
-Here, keep the change. -Thanks.

331
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:08,968
Hi, Mrs. Kline. l'm sorry l'm late.

332
00:26:09,242 --> 00:26:11,710
That's all right, but Billy is upset.

333
00:26:12,412 --> 00:26:14,403
Hey, how's it going, sport?

334
00:26:15,482 --> 00:26:18,815
l had a little trouble getting away from the office.

335
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,713
Sorry. Come on, let's get going.

336
00:26:22,555 --> 00:26:25,581
Thanks for coming, Billy. Oh, wait a minute.

337
00:26:25,825 --> 00:26:28,760
-Don't forget your goody bag. -Thanks very much.

338
00:26:29,062 --> 00:26:30,654
-Bye. -Thanks a lot.

339
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:34,458
-So, did you have a lot of fun? -You're late.

340
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,465
-l'm not that late. Only 20 minutes. -Want to bet?

341
00:26:38,905 --> 00:26:41,772
All the other mothers were there before you.

342
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,338
Why are you making such a big deal of it? There was traffic.

343
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:54,579
lf you want to be a big boy...

344
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:58,757
...you learn that when somebody says they're sorry...

345
00:26:58,958 --> 00:27:04,157
...you don't hold a grudge and make them feel bad for...

346
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:07,365
...a long time afterwards.

347
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,261
Okay, go ahead.

348
00:27:12,438 --> 00:27:15,202
Don't eat with your fingers. Come on, Billy.

349
00:27:15,441 --> 00:27:18,638
You know better than that. Here.

350
00:27:18,878 --> 00:27:20,345
Use a fork.

351
00:27:23,216 --> 00:27:26,151
Come on, come on. Sit up, sit up, sit up.

352
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,851
How was school today?

353
00:27:29,155 --> 00:27:31,020
Same as usual.

354
00:27:31,224 --> 00:27:33,454
l see the Knicks finally won a game.

355
00:27:33,726 --> 00:27:35,523
l don't care.

356
00:27:35,728 --> 00:27:37,320
What do you mean?

357
00:27:37,564 --> 00:27:40,556
-l like Boston. -Boston? Why do you like Boston?

358
00:27:41,067 --> 00:27:43,228
Because Mommy's from Boston.

359
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,831
Sit up and try to eat. Come on.

360
00:27:50,076 --> 00:27:53,068
Can I be excused? l want to go to bed.

361
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:54,711
Too much birthday cake?

362
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:56,575
Yeah, I guess.

363
00:32:06,332 --> 00:32:07,799
l'm sorry. Excuse me.

364
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,397
Louise, give me a hand.

365
00:32:09,602 --> 00:32:11,001
You're 1 5 minutes late.

366
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,772
-Mr. O'Connor is very upset. -This all of it?

367
00:32:14,006 --> 00:32:18,102
-Yes. Do you want your mail now? -No, just give me the messages.

368
00:32:18,344 --> 00:32:21,745
Remind me to get a Crying Chrissie doll at lunch.

369
00:32:21,981 --> 00:32:23,312
Okay, okay.

370
00:32:23,583 --> 00:32:24,447
Sorry l'm late.

371
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:28,948
And there's a PTA meeting at the school on Tuesday at 4.

372
00:32:31,624 --> 00:32:32,955
Right, thanks.

373
00:32:33,192 --> 00:32:35,854
Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

374
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,927
Know who Charley's seeing now?

375
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,155
Who?

376
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:45,665
A divorced woman with two little girls the same age as Kim and Petey.

377
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:47,803
-Are you kidding? -No.

378
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,098
How do you know?

379
00:32:49,308 --> 00:32:51,173
l know.

380
00:32:51,377 --> 00:32:54,278
How long has it been since you two broke up?

381
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,447
Year and a half.

382
00:32:55,648 --> 00:32:57,843
That long?

383
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,175
Did I ever tell you how sorry...

384
00:33:00,386 --> 00:33:03,480
...how sad Joanna and I were when you guys split?

385
00:33:04,457 --> 00:33:07,949
Look at that cute little boy over there.

386
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,458
You think you'll ever get married again?

387
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,300
-l mean, to anybody. -No.

388
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,900
Why?

389
00:33:18,404 --> 00:33:21,896
Maybe it's different if you don't have children, but...

390
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:27,673
...even if Charley and I aren't living together, and even if we're...

391
00:33:27,914 --> 00:33:32,977
...sleeping with other people, even if he were to get married again...

392
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,881
...he's still my husband...

393
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:39,215
...and he's still the father of my children and....

394
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:45,096
That stuff about ''till death do you part,'' that's really true.

395
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,993
Let's say Charley finishes his midlife crisis...

396
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:53,194
...he's had it with his flings and comes asking for forgiveness.

397
00:33:53,439 --> 00:33:55,066
What would you do?

398
00:33:59,178 --> 00:34:04,172
l think that if he really loved me...

399
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,851
...he wouldn't have let me divorce him.

400
00:34:15,962 --> 00:34:18,226
You still think about him, don't you?

401
00:34:19,765 --> 00:34:21,790
Only all the time.

402
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:31,576
-Think about Joanna? -Never.

403
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,944
Liar.

404
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:40,309
Some pair, boy.

405
00:34:41,787 --> 00:34:43,049
l don't believe it.

406
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:45,723
-You missed the closing. -l'm sorry.

407
00:34:45,925 --> 00:34:50,225
Look, I gotta tell you something. l'm getting very nervous here.

408
00:34:50,429 --> 00:34:53,592
Ever since your wife left you. ls it eight months now?

409
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:55,596
You're not getting any better.

410
00:34:55,835 --> 00:34:56,927
What do you mean?

411
00:34:57,169 --> 00:35:02,436
Look, I can't let your family problems interfere with my responsibilities.

412
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:03,904
l got a shop to run.

413
00:35:04,176 --> 00:35:07,771
l regret it, and I promise you it will never happen again.

414
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,307
Okay?

415
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,513
Yeah?

416
00:35:16,622 --> 00:35:17,782
Yeah, wait a minute.

417
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:20,288
-lt's for you, pick up 461 . -Who is it?

418
00:35:20,526 --> 00:35:22,858
Pick up 461 .

419
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,829
Yeah?

420
00:35:27,767 --> 00:35:30,167
Oh, hi, Billy. What's up?

421
00:35:30,703 --> 00:35:33,934
No, one hour of television a day. That's the rule.

422
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,834
No.

423
00:35:36,609 --> 00:35:40,545
l don't care what the other mothers do, Billy. We made a deal.

424
00:35:40,846 --> 00:35:42,939
l can't talk now. l'm busy.

425
00:35:43,783 --> 00:35:47,549
We will talk about it tonight when I get home, all right?

426
00:35:47,787 --> 00:35:50,449
Double chocolate chip. I remember.

427
00:35:54,727 --> 00:35:56,285
l'm getting very nervous.

428
00:36:03,169 --> 00:36:05,364
Put that down and eat your dinner.

429
00:36:05,638 --> 00:36:07,071
What is this crap?

430
00:36:07,907 --> 00:36:10,171
-lt's Salisbury steak. -l hate it.

431
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,901
You had it last week and you loved it.

432
00:36:13,145 --> 00:36:16,637
No, I didn't. I hate the brown stuff. lt's gross.

433
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:19,249
-lt's onions and gravy. -l'm allergic to onions.

434
00:36:19,585 --> 00:36:21,917
You are not. You had this last week...

435
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:26,190
...and I said it was my favorite and you said, ''lt's my favorite too.''

436
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:28,087
-l did not. -Yes, you did.

437
00:36:29,328 --> 00:36:30,590
lt's regular hamburger.

438
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,488
Take a bite. lt's delicious.

439
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:35,556
What's the matter?

440
00:36:35,835 --> 00:36:37,200
l'm gonna throw up.

441
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:39,563
-No, you're not. -lt's yucky.

442
00:36:39,772 --> 00:36:42,707
lt is not yucky, Billy. Eat it.

443
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,613
Did you bring the chocolate chip ice cream home?

444
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:54,614
Yes, I brought the chocolate chip ice cream home...

445
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,356
...and you can't have it until you eat all your dinner--

446
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:01,455
Where are you going? Get back here now.

447
00:37:01,694 --> 00:37:03,093
Did you hear me?

448
00:37:03,362 --> 00:37:04,556
You'd better not do that.

449
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:08,059
You'd better stop right there. l'm warning you.

450
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,127
Did you hear me?

451
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,804
Now, you listen to me. Don't be smart.

452
00:37:18,077 --> 00:37:20,477
Put that back until you finish your dinner.

453
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:26,317
lf you take one bite out of that, you're in trouble.

454
00:37:28,587 --> 00:37:31,215
Don't you dare. Don't you dare do that.

455
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,288
You hear me? Hold it right there.

456
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:38,529
You put that ice cream in your mouth and you are in very big trouble.

457
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:42,029
Don't you dare go anywhere beyond that. Put it down.

458
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:46,466
l am not going to say it again. l am not going to say it again.

459
00:37:49,575 --> 00:37:50,803
You're hurting me!

460
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,738
Don't you kick me.

461
00:37:53,746 --> 00:37:56,544
-l hate you! -You're no bargain either, pal.

462
00:37:56,749 --> 00:37:59,047
You are a spoiled little brat!

463
00:37:59,318 --> 00:38:02,048
-l hate you! -l hate you back, you little shit!

464
00:38:02,354 --> 00:38:05,755
-l want my mommy! -l'm all you've got.

465
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:10,894
l want my mommy!

466
00:38:14,266 --> 00:38:16,860
l want my mommy!

467
00:38:22,942 --> 00:38:26,241
l want my mommy!

468
00:38:27,379 --> 00:38:29,176
Mommy....

469
00:39:22,835 --> 00:39:23,995
Daddy?

470
00:39:25,304 --> 00:39:26,236
Daddy?

471
00:39:26,605 --> 00:39:28,596
-Yeah? -l'm sorry.

472
00:39:29,942 --> 00:39:31,273
l'm sorry too.

473
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,344
l want you to go to sleep because it's really late.

474
00:39:38,984 --> 00:39:40,076
Daddy?

475
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:42,013
Now what is it?

476
00:39:42,855 --> 00:39:44,288
Are you going away?

477
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,121
No.

478
00:39:46,825 --> 00:39:50,261
l'm staying here with you. You can't get rid of me that easy.

479
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:53,790
That's why Mommy left, isn't it? Because I was bad?

480
00:39:55,834 --> 00:39:57,199
ls that what you think?

481
00:39:58,938 --> 00:39:59,802
No.

482
00:40:01,206 --> 00:40:05,302
That's not it, Billy. Your mom loves you very much...

483
00:40:05,511 --> 00:40:09,277
...and the reason she left has nothing to do with you.

484
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:16,220
l don't know if this will make sense, but I'll try to explain it to you.

485
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,150
l think the reason why Mommy left...

486
00:40:23,128 --> 00:40:24,823
...was because for a long time...

487
00:40:25,097 --> 00:40:30,194
...l kept trying to make her be a certain kind of person.

488
00:40:31,003 --> 00:40:35,963
A certain kind of wife that l thought she was supposed to be.

489
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:39,302
And she just wasn't like that. She was....

490
00:40:40,512 --> 00:40:42,139
She just wasn't like that.

491
00:40:44,683 --> 00:40:49,780
l think that she tried for so long to make me happy...

492
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:54,014
...and when she couldn't, she tried to talk to me about it.

493
00:40:54,693 --> 00:40:58,993
But I wasn't listening. l was too busy, too wrapped up...

494
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:01,461
...just thinking about myself.

495
00:41:02,234 --> 00:41:06,637
And I thought that anytime l was happy, she was happy.

496
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:11,071
But I think underneath she was very sad.

497
00:41:12,745 --> 00:41:14,906
Mommy stayed here longer than she

498
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,514
wanted because she loves you so much.

499
00:41:18,984 --> 00:41:22,647
And the reason why Mommy couldn't stay anymore...

500
00:41:22,888 --> 00:41:25,220
...was because she couldn't stand me.

501
00:41:25,991 --> 00:41:28,858
She didn't leave because of you. She left because of me.

502
00:41:44,777 --> 00:41:48,440
Go to sleep now because it's really late, okay?

503
00:41:50,716 --> 00:41:51,580
Good night.

504
00:41:51,917 --> 00:41:54,579
-Sleep tight. -Don't let the bedbugs bite.

505
00:41:54,787 --> 00:41:56,379
See you in the morning light.

506
00:41:57,089 --> 00:41:58,613
-Daddy? -Yeah?

507
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,018
l love you.

508
00:42:04,196 --> 00:42:05,754
l love you too.

509
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,950
-Ladies and gentlemen... -Ladies and gentlemen...

510
00:42:31,457 --> 00:42:33,482
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

511
00:42:34,126 --> 00:42:36,424
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

512
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:40,988
-With gruesome goblins. -With gruesome goblins.

513
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,394
And ghostly ghosts.

514
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,432
And wicked witches and spooky spooks.

515
00:43:01,386 --> 00:43:05,254
Tom, you and I both know it's a violation of privacy laws.

516
00:43:05,491 --> 00:43:09,450
Look, it doesn't make any difference. lt's name or likeness.

517
00:43:09,661 --> 00:43:13,427
l don't care. Tell them if they want it, they have to pay for it.

518
00:43:13,665 --> 00:43:15,189
All right, bye-bye.

519
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,699
Hello, Kramer.

520
00:43:16,935 --> 00:43:19,130
Can you check the copy on Mid-Atlantic?

521
00:43:19,338 --> 00:43:21,033
l think it's okay.

522
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,782
Yes.

523
00:43:35,020 --> 00:43:36,317
Yes, what?

524
00:43:38,891 --> 00:43:40,358
I'll have dinner with you.

525
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:48,625
Thank you.

526
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:50,824
You're welcome.

527
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,161
Oh, shit!

528
00:44:16,395 --> 00:44:18,090
-l gotta go. -What's the matter?

529
00:44:18,564 --> 00:44:19,394
l gotta go.

530
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:22,692
-Want me to call a cab? -No, l've got an 8:00 meeting.

531
00:44:22,901 --> 00:44:24,459
-Where you going? -Bathroom.

532
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:27,070
That's a closet. Bathroom's over there.

533
00:44:27,673 --> 00:44:29,231
Yeah, you're right.

534
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:34,410
These morons are violating the FTC regulations, and I have to make sure--

535
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:37,776
Hi.

536
00:44:39,618 --> 00:44:42,109
-What's your name? -l'm Phyllis Bernard.

537
00:44:42,354 --> 00:44:43,150
Who?

538
00:44:43,355 --> 00:44:47,553
l'm a friend, uh, business associate of your father's.

539
00:44:49,127 --> 00:44:50,185
Oh, Jesus.

540
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:55,226
-Do you like fried chicken? -Fried chicken? Very much.

541
00:44:55,534 --> 00:44:56,558
So do l.

542
00:44:59,438 --> 00:45:01,736
Well, it's really....

543
00:45:03,408 --> 00:45:05,069
lt's nice seeing you and....

544
00:45:05,277 --> 00:45:06,471
-Bye. -Bye.

545
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:12,783
Kramer, I just met your son.

546
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:17,454
Come on, you're never going to do this if you don't concentrate.

547
00:45:18,056 --> 00:45:22,891
All right, come on. Thattaboy. Get your center.

548
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,790
Okay? How's it feel?

549
00:45:25,130 --> 00:45:25,960
Good.

550
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:30,429
Keep it going, keep it going! That's terrific!

551
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:34,170
Don't stop! Billy, keep your feet moving!

552
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:37,472
Oh, that's terrific. How do you feel?

553
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:39,836
-Good! -You look great!

554
00:45:46,852 --> 00:45:49,116
Don't go too far!

555
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:56,427
-Yeah? -And so the dog really hurt Tom.

556
00:45:56,662 --> 00:46:00,393
So Tom got so mad, he jumped in the potato salad...

557
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:02,760
...and he pushed over the table.

558
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:03,866
Yeah?

559
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,797
-Then-- -Let me get your shoelace.

560
00:46:06,004 --> 00:46:07,164
Then what happened?

561
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:11,809
The big dog kept chasing him, then he flipped the table.

562
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,103
-With all the stuff coming down? -Yeah.

563
00:46:14,513 --> 00:46:15,445
Then what happened?

564
00:46:15,681 --> 00:46:17,876
l don't want to be late for school.

565
00:46:18,183 --> 00:46:20,117
Here's your homework. Give me a kiss.

566
00:46:21,887 --> 00:46:23,184
-Hi, Tommy. -Hi.

567
00:46:31,730 --> 00:46:33,129
Taxi!

568
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,895
Hi.

569
00:46:46,378 --> 00:46:48,846
Your babysitter answers, wouldn't say where you were.

570
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,414
Tell me where you were.

571
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:52,674
Well...

572
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:57,216
...my French professor finally asked me out.

573
00:46:57,556 --> 00:46:59,683
-When? -The other day.

574
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,014
You had a date.

575
00:47:01,259 --> 00:47:03,318
l knew you were keeping something from me!

576
00:47:03,562 --> 00:47:06,725
-l thought he was a pretty neat guy. -Right.

577
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,761
-So we go to dinner. -Yeah?

578
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,899
l find out he's married.

579
00:47:11,603 --> 00:47:13,662
He's deep in analysis.

580
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:17,502
-He's telling me his life story... -Wonderful!

581
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:20,269
...and all I can think of while I sit there...

582
00:47:20,512 --> 00:47:23,675
...is that l'm paying a babysitter $3.25 an hour...

583
00:47:24,015 --> 00:47:25,949
...to listen to his problems.

584
00:47:26,284 --> 00:47:28,878
Daddy! Daddy, look!

585
00:47:29,121 --> 00:47:31,214
-Take that out of your hand. -I'll get him.

586
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,691
Did you hear me?

587
00:47:39,664 --> 00:47:41,859
Hold it, hold it!

588
00:47:43,902 --> 00:47:46,029
lt hurts, Daddy.

589
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:50,800
-Daddy, hurry. -Okay.

590
00:47:55,881 --> 00:47:57,815
-l can't see, Daddy. -Rest your head.

591
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,415
Watch it!

592
00:48:03,054 --> 00:48:04,988
Daddy, please hurry.

593
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:07,683
-We're almost there. -Can't see in my eye.

594
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:11,259
Let me see. Where's the emergency room?!

595
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,337
How did this happen?

596
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:23,507
He fell off the jungle gym.

597
00:48:24,376 --> 00:48:25,604
He had a plane in his hand.

598
00:48:25,844 --> 00:48:27,106
l'm just about through.

599
00:48:27,345 --> 00:48:29,279
-Don't hurt him. -l won't hurt him.

600
00:48:29,514 --> 00:48:32,278
Mr. Kramer, can I talk to you outside?

601
00:48:32,551 --> 00:48:33,882
Yeah. Can she come in?

602
00:48:34,186 --> 00:48:35,084
Margaret, come in.

603
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:37,617
-Stay, Daddy. -I'll be right back.

604
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:40,722
-Daddy, stay. -l'm just outside.

605
00:48:41,059 --> 00:48:42,287
lt's all right, darling.

606
00:48:42,594 --> 00:48:44,061
l'm just talking to the doctor.

607
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,424
He'll be right back.

608
00:48:46,631 --> 00:48:47,598
l'm right here.

609
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:49,859
Will he lose his eye?

610
00:48:50,068 --> 00:48:53,526
No, but I have to take some stitches.

611
00:48:53,772 --> 00:48:54,704
How many?

612
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,069
-About 1 0. -What?

613
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,870
Don't worry. There won't be much of a scar.

614
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,313
This will take about 1 5 minutes, so step over here.

615
00:49:04,549 --> 00:49:06,039
l want to be in there with him.

616
00:49:06,251 --> 00:49:08,947
-You don't need to be in there. -He's my son.

617
00:49:09,454 --> 00:49:12,150
lf you're gonna do something, l'm gonna be with him.

618
00:49:13,091 --> 00:49:15,389
Good boy. You're really brave.

619
00:49:25,804 --> 00:49:27,772
That was a big one.

620
00:49:34,145 --> 00:49:35,806
Stop it.

621
00:49:42,754 --> 00:49:47,851
Okay, we're almost done now. We're almost done now.

622
00:50:29,301 --> 00:50:30,063
How is he?

623
00:50:30,468 --> 00:50:33,494
He's okay. He's sleeping.

624
00:50:34,005 --> 00:50:36,200
lt's okay. I can do that.

625
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:41,040
Ted, l'm so sorry. l feel responsible.

626
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:42,969
l don't know what happened.

627
00:50:43,515 --> 00:50:47,144
One minute he was there and the next he was lying on the ground.

628
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,811
Come on, Margaret.

629
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:53,355
Now listen, I want to ask you a favor, okay?

630
00:50:54,192 --> 00:50:56,490
lt's a big favor.

631
00:50:56,828 --> 00:51:00,320
lf something happened to me-- l'm not saying anything will--

632
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:03,056
--but if a building fell on me...

633
00:51:03,501 --> 00:51:07,494
...would you consider taking care of Billy?

634
00:51:11,776 --> 00:51:15,303
l want you to know that I put some thought into this...

635
00:51:15,513 --> 00:51:16,343
...and l...

636
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:20,216
...can't think of anybody else l would trust with him.

637
00:51:20,885 --> 00:51:23,547
l know you'd be okay with him because...

638
00:51:25,357 --> 00:51:27,086
...you're a good mother.

639
00:51:32,764 --> 00:51:34,789
You're a lousy dishwasher.

640
00:51:36,935 --> 00:51:38,926
-All right? -Okay.

641
00:51:48,213 --> 00:51:49,805
You're all right.

642
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:06,297
Louise, you want to get that?

643
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:12,068
Louise, it's ringing-- Yeah, hello.

644
00:52:13,304 --> 00:52:14,828
Yes, who is this?

645
00:52:19,244 --> 00:52:20,233
Joanna.

646
00:52:39,764 --> 00:52:40,628
Hi.

647
00:52:42,167 --> 00:52:43,532
-Hi. -How are you?

648
00:52:43,768 --> 00:52:45,030
You look great.

649
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:48,638
-How's your...? -What?

650
00:52:49,441 --> 00:52:52,342
-l'm sorry. -l was saying, how's your job?

651
00:52:52,644 --> 00:52:55,010
Fine. Vice president of nothing.

652
00:52:55,313 --> 00:52:56,507
No, really, it's great.

653
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:59,047
-Would you like a drink? -Whatever she has.

654
00:52:59,317 --> 00:53:00,341
-White wine. -Wine.

655
00:53:01,286 --> 00:53:02,878
-How's Billy? -He's terrific.

656
00:53:03,621 --> 00:53:07,318
He had a little accident in a playground. He cut himself.

657
00:53:07,692 --> 00:53:10,525
lt was scary. l ran him to the hospital.

658
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,061
He has a little scar, but he'll be fine.

659
00:53:13,298 --> 00:53:15,664
l've been worrying that it's my fault--

660
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:19,198
Don't do that. You can't even see it from a distance.

661
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:26,973
l sit in the coffee shop across from his school and watch him.

662
00:53:27,178 --> 00:53:28,577
He got so big.

663
00:53:28,813 --> 00:53:30,212
You've been watching him?

664
00:53:30,482 --> 00:53:32,677
l've been in New York for about two months now.

665
00:53:32,884 --> 00:53:34,078
l didn't know that.

666
00:53:34,886 --> 00:53:36,376
Anyway....

667
00:53:36,888 --> 00:53:39,652
That's why I wanted to talk to you today.

668
00:53:40,525 --> 00:53:45,394
Last time you saw me, l was in pretty bad....

669
00:53:45,697 --> 00:53:47,358
-Shaky? -Really bad shape.

670
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,089
Yeah, I was.

671
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,499
l was.

672
00:53:51,536 --> 00:53:53,697
Well, you look lovely now.

673
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,432
-What? -l have a whole speech.

674
00:53:58,743 --> 00:54:00,176
Go ahead.

675
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:06,747
All my life l've felt like...

676
00:54:06,951 --> 00:54:10,182
...somebody's wife or mother or daughter.

677
00:54:10,421 --> 00:54:14,357
Even when we were together l never knew who I was.

678
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:16,292
That's why I had to go away.

679
00:54:16,795 --> 00:54:19,923
ln California, I think I found myself.

680
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,689
l got myself a job.

681
00:54:22,066 --> 00:54:24,967
l got myself a therapist, a really good one.

682
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:30,764
And I feel better about myself than I ever have in my whole life.

683
00:54:30,975 --> 00:54:33,409
l learned a lot about myself.

684
00:54:34,746 --> 00:54:35,713
Such as?

685
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,946
No, really, l'd really like to know what you learned.

686
00:54:47,125 --> 00:54:51,118
l've learned that I love my little boy.

687
00:54:52,430 --> 00:54:55,593
And that l'm capable of taking care of him.

688
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,324
What do you mean?

689
00:54:59,971 --> 00:55:01,063
l want my son.

690
00:55:01,973 --> 00:55:03,099
You can't have him.

691
00:55:03,408 --> 00:55:05,672
Don't get defensive. Don't bully me.

692
00:55:05,910 --> 00:55:07,275
l'm not getting defensive.

693
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:09,406
Who walked out 1 5 months ago?

694
00:55:09,647 --> 00:55:11,842
l don't care. l'm still his mother.

695
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:13,411
From 3000 miles away.

696
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:16,815
Because you sent post cards gives you the right to come back?

697
00:55:17,021 --> 00:55:18,818
l never stopped wanting him.

698
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:20,650
What makes you sure he wants you?

699
00:55:21,092 --> 00:55:22,855
What makes you sure he doesn't?

700
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,422
We're gonna sit here and bat this back and forth.

701
00:55:27,632 --> 00:55:29,793
-lt's like old times. -You can't deny me--

702
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:33,264
Don't tell me what I can or cannot do.

703
00:55:33,605 --> 00:55:36,870
-Don't talk to me that way. -l anticipated this.

704
00:55:37,108 --> 00:55:39,406
Do what you have to. I'll do what I have to.

705
00:55:39,644 --> 00:55:40,804
l'm sorry about this.

706
00:55:41,246 --> 00:55:42,907
Do what you have to do.

707
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:54,252
l don't know the legal jargon for it, but I think it's ''desertion.''

708
00:55:54,492 --> 00:55:59,657
l don't mean to tell you your job, but I have an open-and-shut case.

709
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:04,163
There's no such thing as an open-and- shut case where custody is involved.

710
00:56:05,003 --> 00:56:07,836
I'll bet your ex-wife has already found a lawyer...

711
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:11,098
...who's advised her to move back to establish residency.

712
00:56:11,342 --> 00:56:15,506
The burden is on us to prove that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

713
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:19,272
That means I'll have to play rough. lf I play rough...

714
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:22,815
...you can bet they will too. Can you take that?

715
00:56:23,021 --> 00:56:24,010
Yes.

716
00:56:24,956 --> 00:56:27,117
And it's going to cost you $1 5,000.

717
00:56:28,993 --> 00:56:30,017
That's if we win.

718
00:56:30,361 --> 00:56:32,989
lf we go to appeal, it'll cost you more.

719
00:56:34,299 --> 00:56:35,288
l understand.

720
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:39,294
Now, how old is the child again?

721
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,128
My son is 7.

722
00:56:41,372 --> 00:56:43,033
-That's tough. -Why?

723
00:56:43,308 --> 00:56:47,472
ln cases involving a child that young, the court tends to side with her.

724
00:56:47,712 --> 00:56:49,009
She signed over custody.

725
00:56:49,213 --> 00:56:52,842
l'm not saying we don't have a shot, but it won't be easy.

726
00:56:53,151 --> 00:56:54,948
Do me a favor, will you?

727
00:56:55,186 --> 00:56:58,053
There's something I find useful in matters like this.

728
00:56:58,356 --> 00:57:02,349
l sit down and I write out all the pros and cons on an issue.

729
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,151
Write them and look at them.

730
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:07,957
-l want you to do that, okay? -Okay.

731
00:57:08,199 --> 00:57:09,564
And after that...

732
00:57:09,801 --> 00:57:13,464
...if you're really certain you want to retain custody...

733
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:18,301
...then we'll go in there and beat the pants off them. Okay?

734
00:57:37,095 --> 00:57:40,587
l love you, Billy. I know you're sleeping and can't hear me.

735
00:57:40,898 --> 00:57:43,332
l love you with all my heart.

736
00:58:01,085 --> 00:58:02,677
Ted, you got a lunch?

737
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:07,355
Hi, Jim. I don't know. I was trying to work this idea out here--

738
00:58:07,558 --> 00:58:09,856
Good. I'll pick you up at 1 :00.

739
00:58:11,229 --> 00:58:12,457
Okay, you got it.

740
00:58:13,297 --> 00:58:16,266
So the other morning, l'm at the refrigerator...

741
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:19,265
...getting Billy ready for school.

742
00:58:19,537 --> 00:58:22,973
l'm just in my underwear and he notices l've lost weight.

743
00:58:23,207 --> 00:58:25,698
He comes in and pats me. He comes to here.

744
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:29,811
And he says, ''Daddy, you've really lost a lot of weight.''

745
00:58:30,081 --> 00:58:34,040
He looks up at me and he says, ''And it's all gone to your nose.''

746
00:58:36,387 --> 00:58:38,150
He was so cute. You know?

747
00:58:38,456 --> 00:58:39,388
You know, kids.

748
00:58:39,657 --> 00:58:41,625
lt's delicious, want a taste?

749
00:58:41,826 --> 00:58:43,555
-l'm full. -lt's good.

750
00:58:43,828 --> 00:58:45,728
Listen, Ted...

751
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,629
...l had a call from a friend of mine over at another agency.

752
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:55,296
The Mid-Atlantic people have invited them to pitch the account.

753
00:58:55,506 --> 00:58:56,564
Why?

754
00:58:56,774 --> 00:58:59,242
They're not happy with what we're doing.

755
00:59:00,478 --> 00:59:03,970
l think you should have them over and I'll give a little tap dance.

756
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:07,148
l got Norman working on it.

757
00:59:07,418 --> 00:59:08,976
Norman?

758
00:59:11,956 --> 00:59:14,186
You taking me off the account?

759
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:17,659
You don't like me anymore?

760
00:59:17,962 --> 00:59:19,827
lt's not quite that simple.

761
00:59:22,633 --> 00:59:25,500
l think we're gonna have to make a few changes here.

762
00:59:29,707 --> 00:59:31,334
You're firing me?

763
00:59:33,044 --> 00:59:35,274
Yeah, l'm letting you go, yes.

764
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:39,513
Why?

765
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:43,049
Now, look, Ted, this is a very painful thing for me.

766
00:59:43,287 --> 00:59:47,348
l've been getting a lot of pressure from the guys upstairs.

767
00:59:47,558 --> 00:59:49,492
There wasn't anything I could do.

768
00:59:49,694 --> 00:59:51,958
l think it's better this way.

769
00:59:52,163 --> 00:59:53,323
lf I took your stripes...

770
00:59:53,564 --> 00:59:58,365
...if I put you on a schlock account, you'd hate it, and me for doing it.

771
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:01,503
This way it's a clean break. That's the best thing.

772
01:00:01,873 --> 01:00:04,364
You know my wife is fighting for custody?

773
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,974
You know that we're going to court?

774
01:00:07,245 --> 01:00:10,544
Do you know what my chances are if l'm out of a job?

775
01:00:11,249 --> 01:00:13,376
l understand that you're upset--

776
01:00:13,584 --> 01:00:17,384
l don't want to beg, but l'm asking you, please, as a friend.

777
01:00:18,523 --> 01:00:19,888
l'm asking you.

778
01:00:20,091 --> 01:00:23,720
You're an extremely bright guy. You've got a hell of a talent.

779
01:00:23,928 --> 01:00:27,864
You're gonna land on your feet. You're gonna survive.

780
01:00:28,099 --> 01:00:29,726
Teddy, look.

781
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,262
l know you may be short on cash.

782
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,938
No big hurry about paying this back.

783
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,035
Shame on you.

784
01:01:30,628 --> 01:01:32,892
Daddy, the phone's ringing.

785
01:01:33,798 --> 01:01:34,958
-Mr. Kramer?. -Yes.

786
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:37,293
-Hold on for Mr. Shaunessy. -Ted.

787
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,160
John. What's happening?

788
01:01:39,437 --> 01:01:43,271
They set the court date. l just heard today it's January 9th.

789
01:01:43,474 --> 01:01:47,308
l gotta tell you something. l got fired today. They laid me off.

790
01:01:50,281 --> 01:01:53,273
Yeah, l'm still here. Ted, I won't lie to you.

791
01:01:53,517 --> 01:01:57,078
We don't have a hope of winning if you're out of work.

792
01:01:58,189 --> 01:02:00,623
Yeah, listen, you tell that--

793
01:02:01,292 --> 01:02:04,420
You tell that party and you tell that party's attorney...

794
01:02:04,662 --> 01:02:06,027
...that I want a delay.

795
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,993
Sorry, it's really too late.

796
01:02:08,633 --> 01:02:11,101
-Fine. I'll have a job in 24 hours. -How?

797
01:02:11,335 --> 01:02:13,269
I'll have a job in 24 hours.

798
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:45,696
This is the worst time to look for work.

799
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:49,531
lt's the holidays. We'll have something for you by mid-February.

800
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,037
-March, at the latest. -l can't wait.

801
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:54,972
Mr. Kramer, it's December 22.

802
01:02:55,346 --> 01:02:57,906
lf you could just look in your card catalogue.

803
01:03:03,020 --> 01:03:04,851
I'll take anything.

804
01:03:07,925 --> 01:03:11,088
There might be something at Norman, Craig and Kummel.

805
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,058
What is it?

806
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,992
Something in the art department.

807
01:03:15,232 --> 01:03:16,563
You'd go back on the board.

808
01:03:16,767 --> 01:03:20,168
lt's really a step down, and a cut in salary of 5000.

809
01:03:20,371 --> 01:03:22,032
You'll be happier if you wait.

810
01:03:22,239 --> 01:03:26,198
Call them up, make an appointment for me today at 4:00.

811
01:03:26,410 --> 01:03:28,002
lt's the Friday before Christmas.

812
01:03:28,245 --> 01:03:29,542
lt's still a workday.

813
01:03:29,947 --> 01:03:31,574
Nobody's gonna want to--

814
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:33,511
Either you call them or I do.

815
01:03:33,718 --> 01:03:37,017
lf I call them up, you don't get a commission. Right?

816
01:03:37,254 --> 01:03:39,449
My, we are a hotshot, aren't we?

817
01:03:41,792 --> 01:03:42,884
Yes, we are.

818
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:52,599
-Good afternoon. -l'm Kramer. I have an appointment.

819
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,729
l did all of the copy on that one.

820
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:01,744
That was the most successful ad campaign they ever had.

821
01:04:01,946 --> 01:04:05,541
l did the idea, the layout and most of the copy on that one.

822
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:10,145
Mr. Kramer, I must say, this is very impressive.

823
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,313
l'd like to get back to you.

824
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:16,219
ls there someone I should see before you come to your decision?

825
01:04:16,761 --> 01:04:18,729
Mr. Spencer, our creative director.

826
01:04:18,963 --> 01:04:20,954
Why don't you let me see him now?

827
01:04:21,665 --> 01:04:26,398
He's leaving on vacation. I'll set something up the moment he gets back.

828
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:28,468
-l think-- -Have a nice holiday.

829
01:04:28,773 --> 01:04:31,401
l'd like to see him before he leaves.

830
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:35,911
-Mr. Kramer, I don't-- -l want this position very much.

831
01:04:39,016 --> 01:04:40,005
Wait here.

832
01:05:10,848 --> 01:05:12,475
Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.

833
01:05:12,783 --> 01:05:14,774
-How do you do? -You got 1 0 minutes.

834
01:05:17,721 --> 01:05:22,488
You do understand that the salary is $4800 less than you were making?

835
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:24,226
Yes, I understand.

836
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:28,364
Why are you interested in a position for which you're overqualified?

837
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:29,857
l need the job.

838
01:05:30,701 --> 01:05:34,159
Let me think. I'll let Jack know and he'll get in touch with you.

839
01:05:34,638 --> 01:05:36,128
This is a one-day offer.

840
01:05:36,340 --> 01:05:39,571
You saw my book, you know I can handle the work.

841
01:05:39,844 --> 01:05:42,039
You're gonna have to let me know today,

842
01:05:42,213 --> 01:05:43,874
not at the end of the holidays.

843
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:46,878
lf you want me, make a decision right now.

844
01:05:53,757 --> 01:05:56,157
Could we talk privately for a moment?

845
01:05:56,393 --> 01:05:57,553
Yes, sir.

846
01:06:43,941 --> 01:06:48,537
Mr. Kramer, you got yourself a job. Congratulations.

847
01:06:48,779 --> 01:06:50,076
Really?

848
01:06:52,049 --> 01:06:54,074
-ls he kidding? -Welcome aboard.

849
01:06:54,318 --> 01:06:57,082
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thanks.

850
01:07:15,806 --> 01:07:17,171
Merry Christmas.

851
01:07:30,588 --> 01:07:31,782
Come on.

852
01:07:36,293 --> 01:07:38,488
-What do you think? -lt's neat.

853
01:07:38,696 --> 01:07:41,096
-l told you. -Where is everybody?

854
01:07:41,332 --> 01:07:45,962
lt's Saturday, so very few people come in because it's a day off.

855
01:07:46,437 --> 01:07:48,029
Okay, push ''up.''

856
01:07:51,475 --> 01:07:53,670
Push the top button. Very top button.

857
01:07:53,944 --> 01:07:55,343
Go ahead, jump.

858
01:07:58,983 --> 01:08:00,211
-Look at that! -Neat!

859
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:01,850
You didn't know you were so high.

860
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:04,849
What building is that? That has the pointy top.

861
01:08:05,122 --> 01:08:06,612
That's the Chrysler.

862
01:08:06,890 --> 01:08:08,687
You proud of me?

863
01:08:08,993 --> 01:08:10,187
How'd you get this job?

864
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:13,487
l told them I wanted it. What's that say?

865
01:08:13,697 --> 01:08:14,721
lt says ''Kramer.''

866
01:08:15,032 --> 01:08:17,000
Kramer. Who's that?

867
01:08:17,234 --> 01:08:19,168
-That's us. -That's right.

868
01:08:19,370 --> 01:08:20,803
You want to see?

869
01:08:22,539 --> 01:08:24,564
Wow!

870
01:08:25,743 --> 01:08:28,507
-This is neat. -You like it?

871
01:08:29,079 --> 01:08:30,307
Careful, careful.

872
01:08:30,547 --> 01:08:31,707
-l'm okay. -Scare me.

873
01:08:31,915 --> 01:08:33,542
What's that building?

874
01:08:33,751 --> 01:08:36,481
That's the U.N. building. That's the East River.

875
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,585
Look across there. You see that?

876
01:08:38,822 --> 01:08:41,484
That's Queens. Look way, way down there.

877
01:08:41,725 --> 01:08:43,158
-Know what that is? -What?

878
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:46,056
-Brooklyn. -Where you lived when you were a kid?

879
01:08:46,363 --> 01:08:49,161
That's right, and this is where I work.

880
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:53,326
ls this really your desk?

881
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,338
Are you gonna get remarried?

882
01:08:58,542 --> 01:09:00,601
l hadn't thought about it.

883
01:09:01,111 --> 01:09:03,170
Are you gonna marry Phyllis?

884
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:05,405
No, we're just good friends.

885
01:09:09,219 --> 01:09:11,881
Are you and Mom ever gonna get remarried?

886
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:15,418
No, Mommy and me will never be remarried.

887
01:09:15,926 --> 01:09:19,191
l bet if she saw this, she'd remarry you.

888
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:24,628
You're a con artist. We made a deal.

889
01:09:24,935 --> 01:09:26,960
You take a bath every night...

890
01:09:27,204 --> 01:09:30,264
...and you wash that filthy hair twice a week, right?

891
01:09:30,708 --> 01:09:31,538
-Right? -Yeah.

892
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,037
Okay.

893
01:09:33,277 --> 01:09:34,608
Promise, or you're not going.

894
01:09:35,112 --> 01:09:37,774
Did I have to when Mommy was here?

895
01:09:38,048 --> 01:09:40,710
l don't care what you had to do when Mommy--

896
01:09:42,486 --> 01:09:45,717
Did l, Dad? Did l?

897
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:49,087
Are you listening?

898
01:09:49,293 --> 01:09:52,126
We'll talk about it tonight when I get home, okay?

899
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:53,990
Come here, give me a kiss.

900
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:57,397
-What? -You're a terrific kid.

901
01:10:03,674 --> 01:10:05,505
He says, ''There's the unicorn.''

902
01:10:05,776 --> 01:10:08,438
And he goes underneath there, and he says:

903
01:10:08,679 --> 01:10:10,909
''Crumbs, what's happening?

904
01:10:11,148 --> 01:10:12,775
The air supply has stopped.

905
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,608
Thundering typhoons, what are you doing?''

906
01:10:15,853 --> 01:10:18,185
''Resting. lt's tiring work, you know.''

907
01:10:18,422 --> 01:10:19,912
What's the air supply?

908
01:10:20,157 --> 01:10:23,615
When you got two tanks on your back and you can't get any air...

909
01:10:23,827 --> 01:10:26,022
...you can drown, so he's gotta have that.

910
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:27,524
Ted, John Shaunessy.

911
01:10:27,765 --> 01:10:28,789
Hi, what's up?

912
01:10:28,999 --> 01:10:33,197
l got a call from your wife's lawyer. She wants to see the kid.

913
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:35,970
-She wants what? -She's the mother.

914
01:10:36,173 --> 01:10:38,266
She's within her legal rights.

915
01:10:38,509 --> 01:10:42,707
-How do I know she won't kidnap him? -l don't think she'd bother...

916
01:10:43,013 --> 01:10:45,277
...suing if she's gonna kidnap him.

917
01:10:46,016 --> 01:10:48,883
Wait. l'm not so sure about her mental health.

918
01:10:49,153 --> 01:10:52,452
-What do you mean? -She said she was seeing a shrink.

919
01:10:52,656 --> 01:10:53,680
A psychiatrist.

920
01:10:53,891 --> 01:10:55,324
Did you see her talk to walls?

921
01:10:55,526 --> 01:10:57,118
l'm just saying, you know.

922
01:10:57,361 --> 01:10:59,727
l'm just saying you don't have a choice.

923
01:10:59,997 --> 01:11:03,330
Have Billy at the boat pond in Central Park, Saturday at 1 0.

924
01:11:03,567 --> 01:11:05,694
-Do I have to? -Yes.

925
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:08,237
Thanks very much.

926
01:11:09,506 --> 01:11:12,839
Daddy, will you come on and finish the story?

927
01:11:13,977 --> 01:11:16,172
Okay, l'm coming. l'm coming.

928
01:11:19,917 --> 01:11:23,250
What happens if the guy drowns? How do they find him?

929
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:27,320
When you die, there's bubbles that come up or something.

930
01:11:27,558 --> 01:11:28,820
Where did I leave off?

931
01:11:29,092 --> 01:11:31,583
You left off right there.

932
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,421
''Thundering typhoons....''

933
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,327
lt's got an obstacle course and stuff.

934
01:11:38,569 --> 01:11:40,764
-The cars go really fast. -How much?

935
01:11:41,004 --> 01:11:42,096
lt's really neat.

936
01:11:42,339 --> 01:11:43,772
lt's neat.

937
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:47,237
-Come here, I want you to look-- -Okay, okay.

938
01:12:02,626 --> 01:12:04,958
I'll have him back by 6.

939
01:12:05,963 --> 01:12:07,294
You got so handsome.

940
01:13:03,820 --> 01:13:08,257
Remember, we talked about it, keep your answers short and succinct.

941
01:13:08,492 --> 01:13:11,928
Just tell the truth and it'll be all right. Believe me.

942
01:13:14,498 --> 01:13:17,092
-She's here. -Yeah, I know. I saw her.

943
01:13:17,334 --> 01:13:21,134
Whatever you do, try not to become emotional, no matter what he says.

944
01:13:21,371 --> 01:13:24,966
You'll hear things that may upset you. l don't want you to react.

945
01:13:25,442 --> 01:13:29,538
Persons having business with the Supreme Court, State of New York...

946
01:13:29,846 --> 01:13:33,213
...special term part five, draw nigh and ye shall be heard.

947
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:38,183
This court is now in session. Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.

948
01:13:55,138 --> 01:13:58,665
-ls the petitioner's attorney ready? -l am, Your Honor.

949
01:13:58,909 --> 01:14:01,036
l would like to call Joanna Kramer.

950
01:14:01,345 --> 01:14:03,040
Motherhood, going for the throat.

951
01:14:03,347 --> 01:14:06,214
You swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?

952
01:14:06,483 --> 01:14:07,814
l do.

953
01:14:14,057 --> 01:14:18,255
Now, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell the court how long you were married?

954
01:14:18,528 --> 01:14:19,688
Eight years.

955
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:23,262
And would you describe those years as happy?

956
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,693
The first two, yes.

957
01:14:26,036 --> 01:14:29,528
But after that it became increasingly difficult.

958
01:14:30,407 --> 01:14:34,776
Mrs. Kramer, did you hold a job before you were married?

959
01:14:35,012 --> 01:14:38,504
Yes, I did. When I first got out of Smith...

960
01:14:38,782 --> 01:14:43,776
...l worked in the art department of Mademoiselle magazine for years.

961
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:48,249
Did you continue to work after you were married?

962
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:50,585
No. I did not.

963
01:14:50,861 --> 01:14:52,260
Did you wish to?

964
01:14:52,462 --> 01:14:57,456
Yes, but every time I talked to Ted--

965
01:14:57,701 --> 01:15:02,434
To my ex-husband about it, he wouldn't listen.

966
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:07,233
He refused to discuss it in any serious way.

967
01:15:07,611 --> 01:15:10,171
He said that l probably couldn't get a job...

968
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:12,974
...that would pay enough to hire a babysitter.

969
01:15:13,283 --> 01:15:16,218
Tell me, are you employed at the present time?

970
01:15:16,486 --> 01:15:18,954
l'm a sportswear designer here in New York.

971
01:15:19,222 --> 01:15:21,713
And what is your present salary?

972
01:15:21,925 --> 01:15:24,553
l make $31 ,000 a year.

973
01:15:24,961 --> 01:15:28,488
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

974
01:15:29,566 --> 01:15:31,830
Yes, I do, very much.

975
01:15:32,135 --> 01:15:34,968
And yet you chose to leave him.

976
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,305
Yes.

977
01:15:43,513 --> 01:15:47,074
During the last five years of our marriage...

978
01:15:48,819 --> 01:15:51,344
...l was becoming more and more unhappy.

979
01:15:52,022 --> 01:15:53,455
More and more troubled.

980
01:15:53,690 --> 01:15:57,683
And I really needed somebody to help me...

981
01:15:57,994 --> 01:16:01,020
...but when I turned to Ted, he just...

982
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,192
...wasn't there for me.

983
01:16:04,801 --> 01:16:07,599
So we became more isolated from one another...

984
01:16:07,804 --> 01:16:09,635
...more and more separate.

985
01:16:10,307 --> 01:16:12,935
He was very involved in his career.

986
01:16:14,044 --> 01:16:18,174
And because of his attitude towards my fears...

987
01:16:18,448 --> 01:16:21,884
...and his inability to deal with my feelings...

988
01:16:23,120 --> 01:16:25,554
...l had come to have almost no self-esteem.

989
01:16:27,057 --> 01:16:29,787
l was scared and I was very unhappy.

990
01:16:30,026 --> 01:16:32,494
ln my mind I had no choice but to leave.

991
01:16:34,364 --> 01:16:39,199
At the time I left, I felt that there was something wrong with me...

992
01:16:39,703 --> 01:16:42,536
...and that my son would be better off without me.

993
01:16:44,307 --> 01:16:48,641
And it was only after I got to California that I realized...

994
01:16:48,879 --> 01:16:52,975
...after getting into therapy, that I wasn't a terrible person.

995
01:16:55,719 --> 01:17:00,247
And just because I needed some kind of creative or emotional outlet...

996
01:17:00,524 --> 01:17:03,755
...other than my child, that didn't make me unfit.

997
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:08,597
l would like to submit in evidence a report by Mrs. Kramer's therapist...

998
01:17:08,865 --> 01:17:10,355
...Dr. Eleanor Freedman.

999
01:17:10,567 --> 01:17:11,727
Objection, Your Honour.

1000
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:15,494
The report is irrelevant and not binding on the respondent.

1001
01:17:15,772 --> 01:17:16,830
Overruled.

1002
01:17:18,341 --> 01:17:21,936
Can you tell the court why you are asking for custody?

1003
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,907
Because he's my child...

1004
01:17:26,383 --> 01:17:28,749
...and because I love him.

1005
01:17:30,253 --> 01:17:32,380
l know I left my son.

1006
01:17:33,723 --> 01:17:36,556
l know that that's a terrible thing to do.

1007
01:17:40,096 --> 01:17:43,623
Believe me, I have to live with that every day of my life.

1008
01:17:44,201 --> 01:17:46,362
But in order to leave him...

1009
01:17:47,037 --> 01:17:50,302
...l had to believe it was the only thing I could do...

1010
01:17:52,242 --> 01:17:54,540
...and that it was the best thing for him.

1011
01:17:54,811 --> 01:17:57,439
l was incapable of functioning in that home.

1012
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,705
And I didn't know...

1013
01:17:59,916 --> 01:18:02,214
...what the alternative was...

1014
01:18:02,419 --> 01:18:05,650
...so I thought it was not best that I take him with me.

1015
01:18:05,922 --> 01:18:09,551
However, I have since gotten some help...

1016
01:18:09,793 --> 01:18:14,287
...and I have worked very, very hard to become a whole human being.

1017
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,729
l don't think I should be punished for that.

1018
01:18:21,404 --> 01:18:24,305
l don't think my little boy should be punished.

1019
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:27,072
Billy's only 7 years old.

1020
01:18:27,944 --> 01:18:29,502
He needs me.

1021
01:18:30,447 --> 01:18:33,280
l'm not saying he doesn't need his father...

1022
01:18:34,584 --> 01:18:37,246
...but I really believe he needs me more.

1023
01:18:39,122 --> 01:18:43,525
l was his mommy for five and a half years...

1024
01:18:44,427 --> 01:18:48,488
...and Ted took over that role for 1 8 months.

1025
01:18:52,836 --> 01:18:55,703
But I don't know how anybody can possibly believe...

1026
01:18:55,972 --> 01:18:59,999
...that I have less of a stake in mothering that little boy...

1027
01:19:00,310 --> 01:19:02,471
...than Mr. Kramer does.

1028
01:19:05,882 --> 01:19:07,509
l'm his mother.

1029
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:11,648
l'm his mother.

1030
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:18,118
Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

1031
01:19:18,528 --> 01:19:20,621
l have no further questions.

1032
01:19:22,699 --> 01:19:25,190
Now then, Mrs. Kramer...

1033
01:19:26,036 --> 01:19:30,632
...you say that you were married for eight years, is that correct?

1034
01:19:32,742 --> 01:19:37,873
ln all that time did your husband ever strike you or physically abuse you?

1035
01:19:39,082 --> 01:19:40,310
No.

1036
01:19:40,517 --> 01:19:45,420
Did he ever strike or physically abuse his child in any way?

1037
01:19:46,923 --> 01:19:50,017
Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic?

1038
01:19:51,428 --> 01:19:52,918
A heavy drinker?

1039
01:19:53,863 --> 01:19:55,694
Was he unfaithful?

1040
01:20:03,073 --> 01:20:06,065
Did he ever fail to provide for you in any way?

1041
01:20:08,578 --> 01:20:11,046
l can certainly see why you left him.

1042
01:20:11,281 --> 01:20:12,748
Objection.

1043
01:20:15,018 --> 01:20:17,953
How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

1044
01:20:18,388 --> 01:20:19,878
Permanently.

1045
01:20:21,624 --> 01:20:24,525
How many boyfriends have you had, permanently?

1046
01:20:24,761 --> 01:20:27,025
Objection on grounds of vagueness.

1047
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:28,595
I'll allow it.

1048
01:20:32,736 --> 01:20:33,794
l don't recall.

1049
01:20:34,270 --> 01:20:36,738
More than three, less than 33, permanently?

1050
01:20:36,973 --> 01:20:38,304
-Objection. -Overruled.

1051
01:20:38,575 --> 01:20:40,736
The witness will answer, please.

1052
01:20:42,812 --> 01:20:44,473
Somewhere in between.

1053
01:20:44,748 --> 01:20:46,306
Do you have a lover now?

1054
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:54,086
Your Honour, I would request a direct answer to a direct question.

1055
01:20:54,324 --> 01:20:56,121
Does she have a lover?

1056
01:20:56,426 --> 01:21:00,089
I'll allow that. The witness will answer, please.

1057
01:21:01,831 --> 01:21:04,061
Yes, l'm seeing someone now.

1058
01:21:04,334 --> 01:21:07,064
ls that...permanent?

1059
01:21:08,905 --> 01:21:09,963
l don't know.

1060
01:21:10,173 --> 01:21:12,733
We don't know when you say permanently...

1061
01:21:13,009 --> 01:21:17,275
...if you plan to live in New York, or keep your child, for that matter...

1062
01:21:17,480 --> 01:21:22,281
...since you've never done anything that could be regarded as permanent.

1063
01:21:22,485 --> 01:21:26,854
Objection. I request the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness.

1064
01:21:27,123 --> 01:21:28,317
Sustained.

1065
01:21:28,591 --> 01:21:30,957
I'll put it another way, counselor.

1066
01:21:31,528 --> 01:21:35,259
What was the longest personal relationship in your life...

1067
01:21:35,465 --> 01:21:38,093
...outside of parents or girlfriends?

1068
01:21:40,503 --> 01:21:42,198
l suppose that would be my child.

1069
01:21:42,872 --> 01:21:45,534
Whom you've seen twice in a year.

1070
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:49,506
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband...

1071
01:21:49,779 --> 01:21:53,476
...wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life?

1072
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,318
Would you speak up? l couldn't hear you.

1073
01:22:00,356 --> 01:22:01,618
Yes.

1074
01:22:02,125 --> 01:22:03,717
How long was that?

1075
01:22:05,228 --> 01:22:08,493
We were married a year before the baby...

1076
01:22:09,232 --> 01:22:10,699
...and seven years after.

1077
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:14,733
So you were a failure at the most important relationship in your life.

1078
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:16,632
-Objection. -Overruled.

1079
01:22:16,840 --> 01:22:19,809
The witness's opinion on this is relevant.

1080
01:22:20,677 --> 01:22:22,474
l was not a failure.

1081
01:22:23,146 --> 01:22:26,582
What do you call it, a success? The marriage ended in divorce.

1082
01:22:27,150 --> 01:22:29,550
l consider it less my failure than his.

1083
01:22:29,752 --> 01:22:31,310
Congratulations.

1084
01:22:31,521 --> 01:22:35,389
You've just rewritten matrimonial law. You were both divorced.

1085
01:22:35,592 --> 01:22:37,082
Objection!

1086
01:22:37,927 --> 01:22:41,419
Your Honour, I would like to ask what this model of stability...

1087
01:22:41,731 --> 01:22:43,995
...and respectability has ever succeeded at.

1088
01:22:44,601 --> 01:22:49,436
Were you a failure at the one most important relationship in your life?

1089
01:22:51,674 --> 01:22:56,771
-lt did not succeed. -Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.

1090
01:22:57,080 --> 01:23:01,574
Were you a failure at the one most important relationship in your life?

1091
01:23:01,851 --> 01:23:03,341
Were you?!

1092
01:23:08,958 --> 01:23:10,220
No.

1093
01:23:15,598 --> 01:23:17,429
ls that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?

1094
01:23:24,908 --> 01:23:26,705
No further questions.

1095
01:23:30,713 --> 01:23:33,648
-Did you have to be so rough? -Do you want the kid?

1096
01:23:33,950 --> 01:23:35,212
Daddy?

1097
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:37,381
Daddy.

1098
01:23:37,720 --> 01:23:40,655
-Yeah? -What did you do when you were little?

1099
01:23:40,890 --> 01:23:42,289
The same things you do.

1100
01:23:42,592 --> 01:23:44,992
Did you watch The Brady Bunch?

1101
01:23:45,595 --> 01:23:48,120
No, we didn't have any television.

1102
01:23:48,631 --> 01:23:50,223
You didn't?

1103
01:23:50,500 --> 01:23:52,229
We listened to the radio.

1104
01:23:52,468 --> 01:23:53,901
What else didn't you have?

1105
01:23:54,337 --> 01:23:56,100
We didn't have lots of things.

1106
01:23:56,306 --> 01:23:58,331
-Like? -Like a lot of things.

1107
01:23:59,442 --> 01:24:00,500
What kind?

1108
01:24:03,580 --> 01:24:05,013
Come here.

1109
01:24:06,182 --> 01:24:07,809
We didn't have diet soda.

1110
01:24:08,084 --> 01:24:10,245
We had egg creams, which was chocolate syrup...

1111
01:24:10,486 --> 01:24:12,954
...seltzer water and a bit of milk and you went...

1112
01:24:13,356 --> 01:24:16,154
...and you drank it and it was delicious.

1113
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:18,850
We didn't have the Mets, but we had the Brooklyn Dodgers.

1114
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:22,030
We had the Polo Grounds and Ebbets Field....

1115
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:24,199
Boy, those were the days.

1116
01:24:24,434 --> 01:24:26,493
We didn't have the Volkswagens...

1117
01:24:26,703 --> 01:24:30,332
...but we had all those different cars with funny names on them.

1118
01:24:30,540 --> 01:24:32,974
We didn't have Burger King or McDonald's.

1119
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:37,542
We had automats where you put a quarter in and you'd get...

1120
01:24:37,847 --> 01:24:41,339
...a piece of pie or a sandwich you could see through a window.

1121
01:24:41,551 --> 01:24:44,520
We didn't have graffiti, but we had this guy Kilroy....

1122
01:24:45,154 --> 01:24:47,384
Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.

1123
01:24:47,657 --> 01:24:50,455
He spends a great deal of time with Billy.

1124
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:52,652
He reads to Billy a lot.

1125
01:24:52,862 --> 01:24:56,525
They play together, they talk all the time.

1126
01:24:57,367 --> 01:24:59,062
He's a wonderful father.

1127
01:24:59,335 --> 01:25:02,168
Thank you. No further questions.

1128
01:25:02,405 --> 01:25:05,533
Mrs. Phelps, how long have you known Joanna Kramer?

1129
01:25:05,908 --> 01:25:09,810
About six years, ever since she and Ted moved into the building.

1130
01:25:10,046 --> 01:25:13,641
How often did you see Joanna Kramer and her son?

1131
01:25:14,150 --> 01:25:18,382
l haven't seen them together now for about a year and a half, but...

1132
01:25:18,588 --> 01:25:21,751
...back then I saw them two or three times a week.

1133
01:25:22,091 --> 01:25:24,685
My oldest daughter and Billy play together.

1134
01:25:24,894 --> 01:25:29,058
Can you describe the relationship between Joanna Kramer and her son?

1135
01:25:29,332 --> 01:25:30,094
lt was good.

1136
01:25:30,767 --> 01:25:32,496
Joanna was a very good mother.

1137
01:25:32,735 --> 01:25:34,794
Both Ted and Joanna are very--

1138
01:25:35,004 --> 01:25:38,235
Did Mrs. Kramer discuss her relationship with her ex-husband?

1139
01:25:39,008 --> 01:25:40,339
Yes.

1140
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:43,443
Can you tell the court exactly what she said?

1141
01:25:45,248 --> 01:25:47,409
Joanna wasn't happy for many reasons--

1142
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:52,212
Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer was insensitive to his son's needs?

1143
01:25:56,225 --> 01:25:58,716
Would you answer the question?

1144
01:25:59,729 --> 01:26:02,254
-l didn't hear you. -Yes, but that was before--

1145
01:26:02,598 --> 01:26:05,192
Did you ever encourage her to leave her husband?

1146
01:26:05,635 --> 01:26:06,966
No, I did not.

1147
01:26:09,772 --> 01:26:13,299
Several days before she left, did you say to her:

1148
01:26:13,543 --> 01:26:17,639
''lf you're in this much pain, you owe it to yourself to leave''?

1149
01:26:19,415 --> 01:26:22,213
-l didn't think Joanna-- -Did you say to her:

1150
01:26:22,418 --> 01:26:25,751
''lf you're in this much pain, you owe it to yourself to leave''?

1151
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:30,253
-Yes, but she was my friend-- -No further questions.

1152
01:26:31,627 --> 01:26:33,754
Mrs. Phelps, you may step down.

1153
01:26:33,996 --> 01:26:36,590
Joanna, things are not the same now.

1154
01:26:36,999 --> 01:26:38,432
Ted is not the same man.

1155
01:26:38,668 --> 01:26:41,466
-You don't know how hard he's tried-- -Mrs. Phelps!

1156
01:26:41,671 --> 01:26:43,571
They're beautiful together.

1157
01:26:43,806 --> 01:26:45,637
The witness is asked to step down.

1158
01:26:45,842 --> 01:26:47,742
lf you could see them together...

1159
01:26:47,944 --> 01:26:49,844
...maybe you wouldn't be here now.

1160
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:52,070
Mrs. Phelps, that will be all!

1161
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:59,153
l'm sorry.

1162
01:27:01,657 --> 01:27:02,988
When you were talking--

1163
01:27:03,793 --> 01:27:08,526
When my ex-wife was talking about how unhappy she was during our marriage...

1164
01:27:08,765 --> 01:27:11,427
...most of what she said was probably true.

1165
01:27:11,634 --> 01:27:13,932
There's a lot I didn't understand.

1166
01:27:14,670 --> 01:27:17,298
There's a lot l'd do different if I could...

1167
01:27:17,673 --> 01:27:20,836
...just like there's a lot you wish you could change but can't.

1168
01:27:21,043 --> 01:27:24,376
Some things, once they're done, can't be undone.

1169
01:27:25,515 --> 01:27:27,142
My wife--

1170
01:27:27,483 --> 01:27:32,318
My ex-wife says she loves Billy and I believe she does.

1171
01:27:33,156 --> 01:27:35,681
But I don't think that's the issue here.

1172
01:27:36,726 --> 01:27:38,819
lf I understand it correctly...

1173
01:27:39,695 --> 01:27:43,392
...what means the most here is what's best for our son.

1174
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,300
What's best for Billy.

1175
01:27:47,370 --> 01:27:49,235
My wife used to say to me:

1176
01:27:49,472 --> 01:27:52,703
''Why can't a woman have the same ambitions as a man?''

1177
01:27:53,242 --> 01:27:54,834
l think you're right.

1178
01:27:55,144 --> 01:27:57,374
And maybe l've learned that much.

1179
01:27:57,580 --> 01:27:59,980
By the same token, l'd like to know...

1180
01:28:00,216 --> 01:28:05,176
...what law says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex?

1181
01:28:05,988 --> 01:28:09,151
l've had time to think about what makes a good parent.

1182
01:28:09,425 --> 01:28:12,326
lt has to do with constancy. lt has to do with patience...

1183
01:28:12,528 --> 01:28:14,052
...listening to him...

1184
01:28:14,330 --> 01:28:16,992
...or pretending to listen when you can't anymore.

1185
01:28:17,233 --> 01:28:20,498
lt has to do with love, like she was saying.

1186
01:28:20,837 --> 01:28:24,739
l don't know where it says a woman has a corner on that market...

1187
01:28:24,941 --> 01:28:28,206
...that a man has any less of those emotions than a woman.

1188
01:28:28,444 --> 01:28:31,743
Billy has a home with me. l've made it the best I could.

1189
01:28:32,014 --> 01:28:34,847
lt's not perfect. l'm not a perfect parent.

1190
01:28:35,084 --> 01:28:37,644
Sometimes I don't have enough patience

1191
01:28:37,820 --> 01:28:40,084
and I forget that he's a little kid.

1192
01:28:40,456 --> 01:28:41,855
But l'm there.

1193
01:28:43,559 --> 01:28:47,723
We eat breakfast and he talks to me, and then we go to school.

1194
01:28:47,930 --> 01:28:52,230
At night we have dinner together and we talk and I read to him and....

1195
01:28:53,536 --> 01:28:57,199
And we built a life together and we love each other.

1196
01:29:04,247 --> 01:29:06,215
lf you destroy that...

1197
01:29:07,750 --> 01:29:10,116
...it may be irreparable.

1198
01:29:17,994 --> 01:29:20,986
Joanna, don't do that, please.

1199
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:25,963
-Don't do it twice to him. -Thank you, Mr. Kramer.

1200
01:29:26,269 --> 01:29:27,827
No further questions.

1201
01:29:29,672 --> 01:29:32,072
How long have you worked in advertising?

1202
01:29:32,308 --> 01:29:34,572
Ever since I graduated high school.

1203
01:29:35,845 --> 01:29:39,144
College, I mean. l've been there about 1 5 years.

1204
01:29:39,548 --> 01:29:43,348
Would you say you've achieved a certain status in your profession?

1205
01:29:43,552 --> 01:29:45,611
Yes, I have a good reputation.

1206
01:29:45,888 --> 01:29:49,517
When you worked at Roth, Kane and Donovan, what was your salary?

1207
01:29:49,725 --> 01:29:51,852
Around $33,000 dollars a year when I left.

1208
01:29:52,094 --> 01:29:54,722
Now you work at Norman, Craig and Kummel?

1209
01:29:54,931 --> 01:29:56,922
-Yes. -What is your salary?

1210
01:29:57,533 --> 01:29:59,728
lt's almost 29,000.

1211
01:29:59,936 --> 01:30:02,370
Could you be more specific?

1212
01:30:02,705 --> 01:30:04,935
l make $28,200.

1213
01:30:05,374 --> 01:30:07,365
28,200.

1214
01:30:07,977 --> 01:30:12,414
You're the only person who's working his way down the ladder of success.

1215
01:30:12,615 --> 01:30:17,143
Objection. Your Honor, I ask that counsel's last remark be stricken.

1216
01:30:17,453 --> 01:30:18,385
Sustained.

1217
01:30:18,587 --> 01:30:21,215
ls it true you were fired from your previous job?

1218
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:26,086
-l was let go. -Will you tell us why you were let go?

1219
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:28,792
There was a difference of opinion in policy.

1220
01:30:29,098 --> 01:30:33,660
ls it true your agency lost a major account due to your negligence?

1221
01:30:34,136 --> 01:30:34,966
Objection!

1222
01:30:35,171 --> 01:30:37,969
l'm trying to establish the witness's employment record.

1223
01:30:38,240 --> 01:30:40,572
He cannot hold a job.

1224
01:30:40,843 --> 01:30:42,401
I'll allow it, Mr. Shaunessy.

1225
01:30:43,479 --> 01:30:46,642
lt's not unusual in advertising for a client...

1226
01:30:46,916 --> 01:30:49,111
...to change his mind and go elsewhere--

1227
01:30:49,986 --> 01:30:53,649
Was it true you walked out on a client during a major presentation...

1228
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:57,016
...saying that you had an appointment with a teacher?

1229
01:30:57,293 --> 01:31:00,353
My son was sitting next to a kid who was hitting and biting.

1230
01:31:00,629 --> 01:31:03,291
-Yes or no? -Yes, but he bit my kid.

1231
01:31:03,599 --> 01:31:07,695
Last spring, did you miss a deadline on the Mid-Atlantic account...

1232
01:31:07,937 --> 01:31:10,497
...causing your company a great deal of embarrassment...

1233
01:31:10,706 --> 01:31:12,697
...and considerable financial liability?

1234
01:31:12,942 --> 01:31:15,706
On that day I had to go home because my child was sick.

1235
01:31:15,945 --> 01:31:18,505
Did you or did you not miss a deadline?

1236
01:31:18,781 --> 01:31:20,874
-My son was sick. -Answer the question.

1237
01:31:21,150 --> 01:31:24,347
l'm trying to answer the question. lt's not yes or no.

1238
01:31:25,287 --> 01:31:27,517
-Yes or no? -He had a 1 04 temperature!

1239
01:31:27,723 --> 01:31:30,317
He's lying there sweating! l go home to him!

1240
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:35,397
Mr. Kramer, I urge you to stop or I'll have to hold you in contempt.

1241
01:31:41,470 --> 01:31:43,062
l missed the deadline.

1242
01:31:43,906 --> 01:31:46,739
-Do you have a violent temper? -No.

1243
01:31:47,009 --> 01:31:48,977
-Objection. -l withdraw the question.

1244
01:31:49,178 --> 01:31:52,204
-Do you consider yourself a fit parent? -Yes, I do.

1245
01:31:52,481 --> 01:31:55,416
ls it true your child nearly lost an eye while in your care?

1246
01:31:55,718 --> 01:31:57,276
-Objection. -Overruled.

1247
01:31:57,486 --> 01:31:58,976
Answer the question.

1248
01:31:59,255 --> 01:32:01,485
He was in the playground, on the jungle gym--

1249
01:32:01,757 --> 01:32:04,726
And fell and nearly lost an eye while in your care.

1250
01:32:04,927 --> 01:32:06,258
He fell and cut himself.

1251
01:32:06,495 --> 01:32:08,087
ls it true you told your ex-wife...

1252
01:32:08,330 --> 01:32:12,027
...you were responsible for the injury that disfigured your child?

1253
01:32:12,334 --> 01:32:13,528
Did you tell her:

1254
01:32:14,003 --> 01:32:17,336
''When it happened I felt guilty. l felt it was my fault''?

1255
01:32:17,573 --> 01:32:20,565
-Objection! -l have concluded my questions.

1256
01:32:56,445 --> 01:32:57,469
Ted?

1257
01:32:59,081 --> 01:33:00,480
Ted?

1258
01:33:05,488 --> 01:33:10,551
l'm sorry. I mentioned the accident to him two months ago...

1259
01:33:10,759 --> 01:33:13,819
...and I never thought he would bring it up, never.

1260
01:33:15,397 --> 01:33:16,762
Believe me.

1261
01:33:17,666 --> 01:33:21,966
l never would have mentioned it if l thought he'd pull a thing like that.

1262
01:33:23,005 --> 01:33:24,267
l'm sorry.

1263
01:33:24,673 --> 01:33:25,970
l'm....

1264
01:33:37,453 --> 01:33:38,477
Ted.

1265
01:33:38,754 --> 01:33:40,779
-Hi. -Hi. Here, let me help you.

1266
01:33:40,990 --> 01:33:42,252
Heard anything yet?

1267
01:33:42,491 --> 01:33:45,358
Any day. My lawyer says no news is good news.

1268
01:33:45,661 --> 01:33:47,253
-Guess what. -What?

1269
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:50,090
Charley and I are talking about getting back together.

1270
01:33:50,299 --> 01:33:52,995
Really? Did he finally call you?

1271
01:33:53,202 --> 01:33:54,760
No, I called him.

1272
01:33:55,037 --> 01:33:56,163
How come?

1273
01:33:56,438 --> 01:34:00,602
l don't know. I got to thinking about a lot of things since the trial.

1274
01:34:00,843 --> 01:34:01,832
And....

1275
01:34:02,611 --> 01:34:05,341
l don't think it'll work out, but he seems to want it.

1276
01:34:05,614 --> 01:34:08,879
That's terrific. How do you feel?

1277
01:34:09,118 --> 01:34:12,645
l don't know. l feel scared, I guess.

1278
01:34:22,898 --> 01:34:24,832
-Hi. -Hi.

1279
01:34:27,336 --> 01:34:28,633
l lost.

1280
01:34:29,972 --> 01:34:32,236
l can't tell you how sorry I am.

1281
01:34:41,183 --> 01:34:42,480
What happened?

1282
01:34:43,819 --> 01:34:47,152
The judge went for motherhood right down the line.

1283
01:34:48,157 --> 01:34:52,321
''Ordered and decreed that the petitioner be awarded custody...

1284
01:34:52,595 --> 01:34:54,859
...effective Monday, the 23rd of January...

1285
01:34:55,231 --> 01:35:00,100
...that the respondent pay for the support of the child, $400 a month.

1286
01:35:00,369 --> 01:35:02,894
The father shall have the following visitation rights:

1287
01:35:03,205 --> 01:35:06,902
Every other weekend, one night a week to be mutually agreed upon...

1288
01:35:07,209 --> 01:35:10,007
...and one half of the child's vacation period.''

1289
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,510
-That's it. -What if I fight it?

1290
01:35:12,715 --> 01:35:14,580
l can't guarantee anything.

1291
01:35:14,783 --> 01:35:16,182
I'll take my chances.

1292
01:35:16,452 --> 01:35:18,750
-lt'll cost you. -I'll pay anything.

1293
01:35:19,455 --> 01:35:22,083
Look, Ted, I have to tell you something.

1294
01:35:23,425 --> 01:35:26,121
This time it'll be Billy that pays.

1295
01:35:26,362 --> 01:35:28,455
I'll have to put him on the stand.

1296
01:35:28,931 --> 01:35:30,626
l can't do that.

1297
01:35:30,933 --> 01:35:32,924
No, I don't want to do that.

1298
01:35:35,704 --> 01:35:38,468
Thanks very much for your time. l'm gonna take a walk.

1299
01:35:54,823 --> 01:35:57,314
Ted? lt's me.

1300
01:36:02,631 --> 01:36:03,791
Ted?

1301
01:36:04,333 --> 01:36:05,891
l just heard.

1302
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,963
Please go away.

1303
01:36:09,104 --> 01:36:11,095
Are you okay?

1304
01:36:12,675 --> 01:36:16,304
l just have to be by myself for a while, Margaret.

1305
01:36:23,952 --> 01:36:25,010
l don't understand.

1306
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:28,256
The problem is your mom and l both want you to live with us.

1307
01:36:28,490 --> 01:36:32,824
So that's why we decided to go see this man, who is the judge...

1308
01:36:33,028 --> 01:36:36,486
...and we let him decide because he's very wise and experienced.

1309
01:36:36,699 --> 01:36:40,328
We talked to him for a few days and then asked what he thought.

1310
01:36:40,602 --> 01:36:42,866
You know what? He agreed with Mommy.

1311
01:36:43,105 --> 01:36:46,666
He thought it'd be terrific if you lived with her from now on.

1312
01:36:46,942 --> 01:36:50,378
l'm lucky because I get to have dinner with you once a week.

1313
01:36:50,646 --> 01:36:53,638
And twice a month we spend the weekends together.

1314
01:36:55,217 --> 01:36:58,448
Where's my bed gonna be? Where am I gonna sleep?

1315
01:36:58,821 --> 01:37:02,882
Mommy's figured that all out. You have your own bedroom at her place.

1316
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,851
-Where will all my toys be? -At Mommy's.

1317
01:37:07,062 --> 01:37:09,326
We're gonna take all your toys over there.

1318
01:37:09,531 --> 01:37:12,625
lf you play your cards right, she'll buy you some new ones.

1319
01:37:13,736 --> 01:37:16,034
Who's gonna read me my bedtime stories?

1320
01:37:16,472 --> 01:37:18,030
Mommy will.

1321
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:21,232
You're not gonna kiss me good night anymore?

1322
01:37:21,510 --> 01:37:23,740
No, I won't be able to do that.

1323
01:37:23,979 --> 01:37:27,415
But, you know, I get to visit.

1324
01:37:29,985 --> 01:37:32,510
lt's gonna be okay. Really.

1325
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:35,212
lf I don't like it, can I come home?

1326
01:37:35,424 --> 01:37:37,016
What do you mean?

1327
01:37:37,259 --> 01:37:39,420
You'll have a great time with Mommy.

1328
01:37:39,661 --> 01:37:42,027
Really. She loves you so much.

1329
01:37:42,564 --> 01:37:43,895
Dad?

1330
01:37:44,933 --> 01:37:48,494
Don't forget, once, if you can just call me up, okay?

1331
01:37:55,010 --> 01:37:56,841
We're gonna be okay.

1332
01:38:01,683 --> 01:38:03,776
Let's go get some ice cream.

1333
01:39:43,485 --> 01:39:46,318
Come on, let's get this show on the road.

1334
01:39:48,357 --> 01:39:50,325
Let's get a little hustle now, okay?

1335
01:39:50,526 --> 01:39:52,323
Come on, set the table.

1336
01:40:01,003 --> 01:40:02,197
Come on.

1337
01:40:13,882 --> 01:40:15,315
Are you ready?

1338
01:40:33,735 --> 01:40:34,565
Yes?

1339
01:40:34,836 --> 01:40:37,430
lt's Joanna. l'm downstairs in the lobby.

1340
01:40:37,673 --> 01:40:40,107
Can you come down here and meet me alone?

1341
01:40:47,182 --> 01:40:48,171
Hi.

1342
01:40:49,551 --> 01:40:50,745
What's up?

1343
01:40:55,190 --> 01:40:57,454
Tell me. What? What's the matter?

1344
01:40:58,193 --> 01:41:00,127
l woke up this morning.

1345
01:41:04,066 --> 01:41:05,966
Kept thinking about Billy...

1346
01:41:06,234 --> 01:41:09,203
...and I was thinking about him waking up in his room...

1347
01:41:09,404 --> 01:41:12,202
...with his little clouds all around that I painted...

1348
01:41:12,441 --> 01:41:17,208
...and I thought I should have painted clouds downtown because...

1349
01:41:18,880 --> 01:41:22,475
...then he would think that he was waking up at home.

1350
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:28,918
l came here to take my son home.

1351
01:41:33,161 --> 01:41:35,595
And I realized he already is home.

1352
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:44,404
l love him very much.

1353
01:41:49,778 --> 01:41:52,076
l'm not gonna take him with me.

1354
01:42:00,989 --> 01:42:03,856
Can I go up and talk to him?

1355
01:42:04,192 --> 01:42:05,318
Yeah.

1356
01:42:13,435 --> 01:42:16,871
Why don't you go upstairs and see him and I'll wait here.

1357
01:42:28,283 --> 01:42:29,807
How do I look?

1358
01:42:31,953 --> 01:42:32,942
Terrific.
