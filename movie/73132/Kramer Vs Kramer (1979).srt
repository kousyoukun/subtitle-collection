1
00:01:57,923 --> 00:01:59,788
I love you, Billy.

2
00:02:03,729 --> 00:02:06,061
I love you too, Mommy.

3
00:02:12,438 --> 00:02:13,803
Night-night.

4
00:02:16,942 --> 00:02:18,341
Sleep tight.

5
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,771
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

6
00:02:25,518 --> 00:02:28,976
I'll see you in the morning light.

7
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,493
I love you.

8
00:03:03,556 --> 00:03:06,024
They're going to make me
an assistant art director.

9
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:06,783
So Kenny says:

10
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:09,517
"You get yourself a Burberry coat.

11
00:03:09,795 --> 00:03:13,390
If you're gonna be Madison Avenue,
you have to look it."

12
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,192
Saturday afternoon, I go out,
and it's cold.

13
00:03:16,468 --> 00:03:19,460
I go to this place
that specializes in Burberrys...

14
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:22,469
and say, "I want a Burberry coat,
37 short."

15
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:25,575
They put it on,
and I look beautiful in it.

16
00:03:25,844 --> 00:03:27,004
I say, "I'll buy it."

17
00:03:27,213 --> 00:03:29,408
And right then, I start to sweat.

18
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:33,709
I take my checkbook out, start to
sign the check, and my hand shakes...

19
00:03:33,986 --> 00:03:35,749
because I'm so scared.

20
00:03:36,021 --> 00:03:37,488
- Good night.
- Where you going?

21
00:03:37,723 --> 00:03:41,557
- I gotta get home.
- Oh, Jesus, I gotta go.

22
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,091
Okay, so let me finish.

23
00:03:43,362 --> 00:03:45,887
So I sign it,
and my hand starts shaking...

24
00:03:47,399 --> 00:03:50,994
Who is this? Danny, right?
Taxi!

25
00:03:51,237 --> 00:03:55,571
- Come on, I gotta tell you something.
- I can't. I gotta get home.

26
00:03:55,841 --> 00:03:58,503
Gotta talk to you
about something important.

27
00:03:58,744 --> 00:04:02,236
I'm putting you in charge
of the Mid-Atlantic account.

28
00:04:24,036 --> 00:04:27,164
By the end of the year, we'll
have them up to 10 million.

29
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:30,604
If this campaign works out the way
I know it will...

30
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:32,741
they'll offer me a partnership.

31
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:34,378
That's terrific!

32
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,880
When that happens, I just want you
to know I'm taking you along.

33
00:04:40,252 --> 00:04:44,211
Wow! Wow! That's terrific.

34
00:05:01,774 --> 00:05:03,765
Joanna.

35
00:05:04,343 --> 00:05:06,072
I'm home.

36
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:12,481
I forgot my keys. I gotta call
the office before they go.

37
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,243
Jo, you're gonna be real proud
of me. I got good news.

38
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,658
- Ted.
- One second. Let me just do this.

39
00:05:25,331 --> 00:05:28,596
You know Jack Edwards in accounting?
He committed suicide.

40
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:30,927
Yeah, hi. Ted Kramer.

41
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:35,038
I gotta get those photos from
the retoucher by tomorrow morning.

42
00:05:35,274 --> 00:05:37,970
- I'm leaving you.
- Honey, please. I can't hear.

43
00:05:39,645 --> 00:05:42,478
Okay, you too. Thanks a lot.
See you tomorrow.

44
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:44,547
Did you guys eat?

45
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:45,817
I'm leaving you.

46
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:50,618
Here are my keys.

47
00:05:50,823 --> 00:05:53,951
Here's my American Express,
my Bloomingdale's card...

48
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:58,027
my checkbook. I've taken
$2000 out of our savings account.

49
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:00,494
That's what I had when we got married.

50
00:06:00,733 --> 00:06:03,497
- Is this a joke?
- Here's the cleaning, laundry ticket.

51
00:06:03,736 --> 00:06:05,897
You can pick them both up
on Saturday.

52
00:06:06,138 --> 00:06:08,629
- You. You have to pick them up.
- What's wrong?

53
00:06:08,874 --> 00:06:12,674
I paid the rent, the Con Ed bill,
and the phone bill, so...

54
00:06:12,911 --> 00:06:14,708
You really pick your times to...

55
00:06:18,884 --> 00:06:22,752
I'm sorry I was late, but I was
busy making a living, all right?

56
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:26,820
Come on, okay? Can we stop now?

57
00:06:27,092 --> 00:06:29,219
So that's everything.

58
00:06:34,433 --> 00:06:36,094
Enough, enough. All right?

59
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:38,393
What are you doing?

60
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:42,231
Where are you going? Just tell me
what I did that's so terrible.

61
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:43,872
- It's not you.
- Then what?

62
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:46,101
It's me. It's my fault.

63
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:48,068
You married the wrong person.

64
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,748
- I can't hack it.
- Let's just go inside.

65
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:53,075
I can't, I tried.
I swear...

66
00:06:53,352 --> 00:06:56,185
Joanna, please, just... I'm sorry.

67
00:06:56,455 --> 00:07:01,552
- No, please don't make me go in there.
- I just want to talk.

68
00:07:01,794 --> 00:07:04,354
If you do, I swear, one day...

69
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:07,087
I'll go right out the window.
- Oh, please.

70
00:07:07,366 --> 00:07:09,630
Come on, now. What about Billy?

71
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:16,973
I'm not taking him with me.
I'm no good for him.

72
00:07:17,476 --> 00:07:18,909
I'm terrible with him.

73
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:21,975
I have no patience.

74
00:07:22,214 --> 00:07:24,273
He's better off without me.

75
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:27,952
Joanna, please.

76
00:07:32,825 --> 00:07:35,123
And I don't love you anymore.

77
00:07:37,129 --> 00:07:39,120
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

78
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:16,831
Hi, Margaret. This is Ted.
Is my wife there?

79
00:08:17,035 --> 00:08:20,198
Yeah. Joanna come in?

80
00:08:20,506 --> 00:08:24,772
We had a little fight. I thought
she might have stopped by.

81
00:08:24,977 --> 00:08:28,310
If she comes in, tell her to come up
or just give me a ring.

82
00:08:30,215 --> 00:08:34,345
Don't worry. She didn't take
her suitcase. She won't get very far.

83
00:08:35,521 --> 00:08:38,854
I got work to do.
If she comes in, tell her to call me.

84
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:47,488
It's about time.

85
00:08:50,536 --> 00:08:53,403
Joanna, that's the most insensitive...
Hi, Margaret.

86
00:08:53,672 --> 00:08:57,506
- She packed a suitcase?
- Look, it's nothing serious, really.

87
00:08:57,743 --> 00:08:59,711
She tell you where she was going?

88
00:08:59,978 --> 00:09:02,708
- You tell me.
- How would I know? I wasn't here.

89
00:09:02,981 --> 00:09:06,473
Clearly, you two had many
talks about my shortcomings...

90
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:09,710
which I haven't been privy to.
And I'd love to talk...

91
00:09:09,988 --> 00:09:13,219
but I have a major presentation
in the morning...

92
00:09:13,492 --> 00:09:16,325
and I gotta get my work done.
So please allow me...

93
00:09:16,562 --> 00:09:19,190
You don't realize
we have a serious problem.

94
00:09:19,398 --> 00:09:22,367
Wrong. Me. I got the problem.
All you gotta do is...

95
00:09:22,601 --> 00:09:25,001
go out the door and go back to bed.

96
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:27,928
- The fact is...
- For six months...

97
00:09:28,206 --> 00:09:31,767
I've been spitting blood to get
this agency its biggest account.

98
00:09:32,044 --> 00:09:34,103
And at five, we got it.

99
00:09:34,947 --> 00:09:39,407
At eight, the vice president tells me
I'll be the next creative director.

100
00:09:39,618 --> 00:09:42,212
I come through this door
to share with my wife...

101
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:46,187
one of the five best days
of my life, and she looks at me...

102
00:09:46,425 --> 00:09:49,019
and tells me she doesn't want
to live with me!

103
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:57,127
Can't you understand
what she's done to me?

104
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:02,596
She loused up one of the five
best days of your life.

105
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:08,878
You're terrific. Boy, you're...

106
00:10:09,114 --> 00:10:11,105
Thanks very much, really.

107
00:10:12,784 --> 00:10:14,308
Sisterhood.

108
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:16,783
Thank you for coming
to cheer me up, but...

109
00:10:17,122 --> 00:10:19,090
I didn't come to cheer you up.

110
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:21,256
I'm concerned about Joanna.

111
00:10:21,793 --> 00:10:25,285
Maybe you can be concerned
in the privacy of your own apartment.

112
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:30,632
Joanna and I never had any problems
until you and Charley split up.

113
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:32,836
Oh, I don't believe you.

114
00:10:33,105 --> 00:10:34,902
Just tell me the truth, okay?

115
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,801
Did you set her up to this?

116
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,975
No, I didn't put her up to this.

117
00:10:39,244 --> 00:10:41,678
- Give her a little pep talk?
- No, I didn't.

118
00:10:41,913 --> 00:10:43,904
Joanna and I talk a great deal.

119
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,276
And Joanna is a very unhappy woman.

120
00:10:46,518 --> 00:10:51,012
And it took a lot of courage for her
to walk out of here.

121
00:10:51,256 --> 00:10:54,282
How much courage does it take
to walk out on your kid?

122
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,000
Where's Mommy?

123
00:12:10,268 --> 00:12:11,860
- What?
- Where's Mommy?

124
00:12:12,104 --> 00:12:13,537
What time is it?

125
00:12:14,773 --> 00:12:19,608
The little hand's on the 7, the big
hand's on the 9. Where's Mommy?

126
00:12:21,446 --> 00:12:26,509
Oh, God. Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
You want to know where Mommy is?

127
00:12:26,752 --> 00:12:30,051
- She's supposed to take me to school.
- She told me to do it.

128
00:12:30,255 --> 00:12:32,223
Okay, I'll tell you where she went.

129
00:12:32,424 --> 00:12:36,190
You know when you and your friends
don't get along and fight?

130
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,954
And you want to go and be alone
for a while?

131
00:12:39,197 --> 00:12:41,859
Sometimes Mommy and Daddy
don't get along...

132
00:12:42,067 --> 00:12:45,867
and one of them wants to go
and be by themselves for a while.

133
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:48,403
- When is Mommy coming back?
- Soon.

134
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,132
Now we are gonna have breakfast!
Okay? Just you and me.

135
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,537
- What do you want?
- French toast.

136
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:56,937
You want French toast, you got it.

137
00:12:57,149 --> 00:13:00,312
Put up a little water for Daddy
to have some coffee.

138
00:13:00,552 --> 00:13:03,578
We got how many eggs?
Two for you and two for me.

139
00:13:03,822 --> 00:13:04,880
We got milk.

140
00:13:05,123 --> 00:13:06,590
We got butter.

141
00:13:06,792 --> 00:13:08,589
We got $5.

142
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:11,285
I got $5.
Here, you sit here.

143
00:13:12,097 --> 00:13:14,895
Okay, can you be
my number one helper?

144
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:17,896
Watch this. One hand.

145
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,069
Here we go.

146
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:23,139
Did you know that all
the best chefs are men?

147
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:26,504
Isn't this terrific?
We gotta do this more often.

148
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:29,236
- You dropped some shell in it.
- That's okay.

149
00:13:29,648 --> 00:13:33,084
Makes it crunchier.
You like it crunchy, don't you?

150
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:37,153
Why don't you beat them,
and I'll get everything else going.

151
00:13:37,422 --> 00:13:39,356
- What time is school?
- 8:30.

152
00:13:39,658 --> 00:13:43,788
Gotta get the show on the road.
I gotta shower, shave and shampoo.

153
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:45,155
I got people to see.

154
00:13:45,363 --> 00:13:47,923
And Daddy's gotta bring home
the bacon...

155
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,633
and he's gotta cook it.

156
00:13:50,035 --> 00:13:53,027
We're having a good time!
Where does Mommy keep the..?

157
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:55,632
- In the stove.
- The pan. The stove.

158
00:13:57,876 --> 00:13:59,503
First, we need a nice fire.

159
00:14:00,345 --> 00:14:02,438
No, you're not doing it right.

160
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:06,117
Look, you gotta do it fast. See?
It's the wrist.

161
00:14:06,351 --> 00:14:08,216
So the gucky part dissolves.

162
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:12,287
Then you take the bread, and we...

163
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,185
We...

164
00:14:15,126 --> 00:14:18,289
We fold the French toast.
That's what we do.

165
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,022
- I think you forgot milk.
- I didn't. Milk comes last.

166
00:14:23,301 --> 00:14:25,963
When you're having a good time
you forget things.

167
00:14:26,671 --> 00:14:29,902
I just wanted to see
if you're paying attention.

168
00:14:30,408 --> 00:14:33,900
Fun, isn't it? When's the last
time Mommy let you in the kitchen?

169
00:14:34,212 --> 00:14:35,645
I don't like it in pieces.

170
00:14:35,881 --> 00:14:39,977
It tastes the same whether it's in
pieces or whole. Bread is bread.

171
00:14:40,318 --> 00:14:42,650
Besides, French toast
is always folded.

172
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:46,085
In the best restaurants,
you see folded French toast.

173
00:14:46,424 --> 00:14:48,255
You get more bites that way.

174
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:53,326
And while that's going,
Daddy's gonna make coffee.

175
00:14:53,598 --> 00:14:55,156
You having a good time?

176
00:14:55,367 --> 00:14:58,996
I don't remember the last
time I had such a good time.

177
00:14:59,905 --> 00:15:01,770
Daddy's gonna make himself coffee.

178
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,440
- That's too much!
- No, I like it strong.

179
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:06,836
Mommy always makes it too weak.

180
00:15:09,047 --> 00:15:11,015
Can I have some orange juice?

181
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,182
Right. One OJ coming up
for the kid.

182
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:18,121
Daddy, it's burning!

183
00:15:18,957 --> 00:15:20,584
- What?
- It's burning!

184
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:25,519
Damn it! Goddamn her!

185
00:15:28,633 --> 00:15:30,430
Oh, shit.

186
00:15:32,604 --> 00:15:36,404
Just take it easy.
Everything is fine. We're terrific.

187
00:15:36,641 --> 00:15:38,108
Just...

188
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:42,708
Just take it easy.
Nothing is the matter.

189
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:47,817
- What?
- Your hand's sweaty.

190
00:15:48,086 --> 00:15:50,611
- When's Mommy coming back?
- Soon. I told you.

191
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,222
- Is she gonna pick me up?
- Probably. If she doesn't, I will.

192
00:15:54,459 --> 00:15:56,324
- What if you forget?
- I won't.

193
00:15:56,594 --> 00:15:59,893
- What if you get run over?
- Mommy will pick you up.

194
00:16:00,131 --> 00:16:02,292
- Miss! What grade are you in?
- First.

195
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,060
This is Billy Kramer.
He's in first grade.

196
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:07,670
Take care of him. I gotta
get a taxi, I'm late. Taxi!

197
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:09,907
Taxi!

198
00:16:12,644 --> 00:16:15,511
- Congratulations about Mid-Atlantic.
- Thanks.

199
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:19,181
- Congratulations.
- Is the stuff back from the retoucher?

200
00:16:19,417 --> 00:16:21,749
- Great news, Ted.
- Thanks a lot.

201
00:16:21,987 --> 00:16:24,455
Morning. 11:00, meeting
with Airwick...

202
00:16:24,689 --> 00:16:27,954
- Where's the stuff from the retoucher?
- Right here.

203
00:16:28,626 --> 00:16:30,025
- Did my wife call?
- No.

204
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:33,594
You're gonna have to cancel
the Airwick at 11:30.

205
00:17:04,796 --> 00:17:08,027
She's never gone this far before,
but in the past...

206
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,132
I've known
when she's upset because...

207
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,030
she gets very quiet.

208
00:17:13,304 --> 00:17:16,831
Our pattern has been that I've said,
"What's the matter?"...

209
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:18,907
and she'll kind of sit on it.

210
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,236
But in the last few weeks,
maybe couple of months...

211
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:26,416
since we've been going crazy
with this account, I've been remiss.

212
00:17:26,684 --> 00:17:32,020
And I just didn't look at the writing
on the wall, so she's kind of...

213
00:17:32,557 --> 00:17:36,152
I think this is a way
of making me stop, look and say:

214
00:17:36,394 --> 00:17:38,521
"I'm as important as your work."

215
00:17:40,832 --> 00:17:42,857
Is there another guy?

216
00:17:44,869 --> 00:17:47,599
I don't think so.
She's not the type.

217
00:17:47,906 --> 00:17:50,739
She's got this friend, Margaret,
downstairs...

218
00:17:51,443 --> 00:17:55,743
you know, women's lib.
I think they may have cooked this up.

219
00:17:56,781 --> 00:17:57,839
It worked.

220
00:17:59,184 --> 00:18:00,617
I'm going crazy!

221
00:18:00,852 --> 00:18:03,047
Look, not to worry.

222
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:04,846
She'll be back.

223
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:07,422
I didn't know it would happen to me!

224
00:18:08,426 --> 00:18:09,950
Don't let it get you down.

225
00:18:10,195 --> 00:18:13,631
I know she'll be back.
I'm terrific, really.

226
00:18:16,234 --> 00:18:19,101
- You do have a problem, Ted.
- Yeah, what's that?

227
00:18:21,973 --> 00:18:23,907
What are you gonna do about Billy?

228
00:18:25,643 --> 00:18:29,602
This just happened last night.
I'm sure when Joanna comes back...

229
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,076
It's none of my business.
I'll butt out.

230
00:18:32,283 --> 00:18:34,911
Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.

231
00:18:35,153 --> 00:18:38,316
I appreciate you
taking the time to talk to me.

232
00:18:39,057 --> 00:18:43,153
May sound a little rough, but...

233
00:18:43,428 --> 00:18:47,660
I think you ought to send Billy away
to stay with relatives for a while.

234
00:18:48,133 --> 00:18:50,624
You mean, until Joanna comes back?

235
00:18:51,436 --> 00:18:53,734
Suppose Joanna doesn't come back?

236
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:58,737
Gee, I don't know...

237
00:18:58,977 --> 00:19:00,501
Ted, listen to me.

238
00:19:00,778 --> 00:19:06,080
I just told the boys upstairs you're
handling the Mid-Atlantic account.

239
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:10,846
You know? A gig like that comes
along once every five, six years.

240
00:19:11,156 --> 00:19:15,422
There's guys here eating their hearts
out because I gave that spot to you.

241
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:19,028
This is important. Don't blow this.

242
00:19:19,297 --> 00:19:23,097
I gotta depend on you. I gotta count
on you for 110 percent...

243
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:27,696
7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
I gotta have that.

244
00:19:28,006 --> 00:19:31,442
I can't be concerned about you
worrying about a kid.

245
00:19:31,776 --> 00:19:35,644
First, you can count on me
25 hours a day, 8 days a week.

246
00:19:35,847 --> 00:19:37,712
Because I'm not a loser, Jim.

247
00:19:37,982 --> 00:19:40,849
I never let anything at home
come into the office.

248
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,383
You asked me to unload in this office.

249
00:19:43,655 --> 00:19:47,318
When I go outside, I'm on top of it.
I want you to know that.

250
00:19:47,525 --> 00:19:49,993
I'm a survivor.

251
00:19:50,195 --> 00:19:54,029
You've given me a shot here.
I'm not gonna let anything blow it.

252
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:56,898
Okay?

253
00:19:59,237 --> 00:20:02,138
Let's have a drink later.
I'm all right. I gotta...

254
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:04,671
blow smoke up Airwick's ass, 11:00.

255
00:20:04,876 --> 00:20:06,537
I'm all right!

256
00:20:06,744 --> 00:20:08,211
You don't worry.

257
00:20:08,413 --> 00:20:09,812
Thank you.

258
00:20:10,815 --> 00:20:12,976
I love you, you bastard.

259
00:20:17,822 --> 00:20:20,518
Daddy?

260
00:20:20,758 --> 00:20:22,555
Daddy?

261
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:29,427
Yeah, honey, just wait a second.
I just want to finish this idea.

262
00:20:29,701 --> 00:20:32,431
Let me get this copy done,
and then I'll talk.

263
00:20:32,737 --> 00:20:37,003
What time is it when an elephant
sits on your fence?

264
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:40,504
Time to get a new fence.

265
00:20:43,948 --> 00:20:46,610
Honey, please...
I just got this sentence.

266
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:48,280
Daddy! Daddy!

267
00:20:49,187 --> 00:20:50,518
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

268
00:20:50,722 --> 00:20:53,953
Get over there and sit
on that couch and don't move!

269
00:20:54,225 --> 00:20:56,887
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it!

270
00:20:57,128 --> 00:21:00,689
Who told you not to drink
this stuff here?

271
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:02,866
- Sorry.
- Yeah, you're sorry.

272
00:21:03,067 --> 00:21:05,763
Told you to keep that juice
in the dining room!

273
00:21:06,604 --> 00:21:07,798
Sorry.

274
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,903
Who took you to the park, gave you
everything you wanted?

275
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:14,373
- Who bought you an ice cream?
- You.

276
00:21:14,612 --> 00:21:18,605
And who promised Daddy that when
we got home, you'd let him work?

277
00:21:20,051 --> 00:21:23,248
- That's ruined. I can't fix that.
- Sorry.

278
00:21:28,793 --> 00:21:32,058
It's past your bedtime.
Why don't you go to sleep?

279
00:21:37,735 --> 00:21:40,329
And brush your teeth
and flush the toilet.

280
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:48,745
- Paper towels. What else?
- We need detergent.

281
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,004
All right.

282
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:53,513
No, Mommy buys the kind
with the orange circles on it.

283
00:21:53,785 --> 00:21:56,777
- There's no difference.
- Mom said it was the best.

284
00:22:01,459 --> 00:22:03,324
- Let's go.
- Get the pink stuff.

285
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:06,927
All right, come on.

286
00:22:07,165 --> 00:22:09,759
Okay. That's it.

287
00:22:10,835 --> 00:22:12,928
We need some cereal.

288
00:22:13,671 --> 00:22:15,366
Okay, what color?

289
00:22:25,116 --> 00:22:27,482
Hey, Billy!

290
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:31,143
Billy! Told you Mommy would write
before the week was up.

291
00:22:31,456 --> 00:22:35,392
- When is she coming back?
- That's what we're gonna find out now.

292
00:22:36,461 --> 00:22:39,157
Okay. Let's read it.

293
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:47,699
"My dearest, sweet Billy."

294
00:22:50,308 --> 00:22:51,866
That's you.

295
00:22:54,178 --> 00:22:56,237
"Mommy has gone away."

296
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:58,982
Sometimes in the world...

297
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:00,514
daddies go away...

298
00:23:00,818 --> 00:23:03,378
and mommies bring up
their little boys.

299
00:23:03,654 --> 00:23:06,521
But sometimes, a mommy
can go away too...

300
00:23:06,758 --> 00:23:09,852
and you have your daddy
to bring you up.

301
00:23:10,161 --> 00:23:12,425
I have gone away
because I must find...

302
00:23:12,663 --> 00:23:16,531
something interesting to do
for myself in the world.

303
00:23:16,768 --> 00:23:19,430
Everybody has to, and so do I.

304
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:27,937
Being your mommy was one thing,
but there are other things too...

305
00:23:28,212 --> 00:23:31,204
and this is what I have to do.

306
00:23:31,416 --> 00:23:33,850
I did not get a chance
to tell you this...

307
00:23:34,118 --> 00:23:36,848
and that is why
I'm writing you now.

308
00:23:37,088 --> 00:23:39,613
I will always be your mommy...

309
00:23:41,225 --> 00:23:43,625
and I will always love you.

310
00:23:44,362 --> 00:23:46,853
I just won't be your mommy
in the house...

311
00:23:47,064 --> 00:23:49,624
but I'll be your mommy
at the heart.

312
00:23:50,268 --> 00:23:54,136
"And now I must go
and be the person I have to be."

313
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,302
We'll read this another time.

314
00:24:01,546 --> 00:24:02,979
I don't care.

315
00:25:14,452 --> 00:25:16,352
- Good night, Jim.
- Come on in.

316
00:25:16,687 --> 00:25:18,882
- Have a drink.
- I can't, I'm late now.

317
00:25:19,123 --> 00:25:22,854
What's the rush? We're having
a party for Norman. Five years here.

318
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,152
Can you believe it?

319
00:25:24,395 --> 00:25:27,159
Wish I could, but I'm late.
I gotta pick up Billy.

320
00:25:27,365 --> 00:25:29,333
You know Jerry Hoover, in media?

321
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,459
Tell you something funny.

322
00:25:31,669 --> 00:25:33,296
Gotta go. See you Monday.

323
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:40,203
Taxi!

324
00:25:41,078 --> 00:25:42,568
Taxi!

325
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,310
- Here, keep the change.
- Thanks.

326
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,933
Hi, Mrs. Kline. I'm sorry I'm late.

327
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:11,674
That's all right, but Billy is upset.

328
00:26:12,376 --> 00:26:14,367
Hey, how's it going, sport?

329
00:26:15,446 --> 00:26:18,779
I had a little trouble
getting away from the office.

330
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:21,677
Sorry. Come on, let's get going.

331
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,546
Thanks for coming, Billy.
Oh, wait a minute.

332
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:28,725
- Don't forget your goody bag.
- Thanks very much.

333
00:26:29,026 --> 00:26:30,618
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.

334
00:26:30,861 --> 00:26:34,422
- So, did you have a lot of fun?
- You're late.

335
00:26:34,632 --> 00:26:37,430
- I'm not that late. Only 20 minutes.
- Want to bet?

336
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:41,736
All the other mothers were there
before you.

337
00:26:44,775 --> 00:26:48,302
Why are you making such a big deal
of it? There was traffic.

338
00:26:50,948 --> 00:26:54,543
If you want to be a big boy...

339
00:26:54,785 --> 00:26:58,721
you learn that when somebody says
they're sorry...

340
00:26:58,923 --> 00:27:04,122
you don't hold a grudge
and make them feel bad for...

341
00:27:04,395 --> 00:27:07,330
a long time afterwards.

342
00:27:07,565 --> 00:27:09,226
Okay, go ahead.

343
00:27:12,403 --> 00:27:15,167
Don't eat with your fingers.
Come on, Billy.

344
00:27:15,406 --> 00:27:18,603
You know better than that.
Here.

345
00:27:18,843 --> 00:27:20,310
Use a fork.

346
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,115
Come on, come on.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

347
00:27:26,984 --> 00:27:28,815
How was school today?

348
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,985
Same as usual.

349
00:27:31,188 --> 00:27:33,418
I see the Knicks finally won a game.

350
00:27:33,691 --> 00:27:35,488
I don't care.

351
00:27:35,693 --> 00:27:37,285
What do you mean?

352
00:27:37,528 --> 00:27:40,520
- I like Boston.
- Boston? Why do you like Boston?

353
00:27:41,032 --> 00:27:43,193
Because Mommy's from Boston.

354
00:27:47,805 --> 00:27:49,796
Sit up and try to eat. Come on.

355
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:53,033
Can I be excused?
I want to go to bed.

356
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,675
Too much birthday cake?

357
00:27:54,879 --> 00:27:56,540
Yeah, I guess.

358
00:32:06,297 --> 00:32:07,764
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

359
00:32:08,065 --> 00:32:09,362
Louise, give me a hand.

360
00:32:09,566 --> 00:32:10,965
You're 15 minutes late.

361
00:32:11,268 --> 00:32:13,736
- Mr. O'Connor is very upset.
- This all of it?

362
00:32:13,971 --> 00:32:18,067
- Yes. Do you want your mail now?
- No, just give me the messages.

363
00:32:18,309 --> 00:32:21,710
Remind me to get
a Crying Chrissie doll at lunch.

364
00:32:21,946 --> 00:32:23,277
Okay, okay.

365
00:32:23,547 --> 00:32:24,547
Sorry I'm late.

366
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:28,913
And there's a PTA meeting
at the school on Tuesday at 4.

367
00:32:31,588 --> 00:32:32,919
Right, thanks.

368
00:32:33,157 --> 00:32:35,819
Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

369
00:32:38,128 --> 00:32:39,891
Know who Charley's seeing now?

370
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:41,130
Who?

371
00:32:41,432 --> 00:32:45,630
A divorced woman with two little girls
the same age as Kim and Petey.

372
00:32:45,903 --> 00:32:47,768
- Are you kidding?
- No.

373
00:32:48,005 --> 00:32:49,063
How do you know?

374
00:32:49,273 --> 00:32:51,138
I know.

375
00:32:51,342 --> 00:32:54,243
How long has it been since
you two broke up?

376
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:55,445
Year and a half.

377
00:32:55,612 --> 00:32:57,807
That long?

378
00:32:58,115 --> 00:33:00,140
Did I ever tell you how sorry...

379
00:33:00,351 --> 00:33:03,445
how sad Joanna and I were
when you guys split?

380
00:33:04,421 --> 00:33:07,913
Look at that cute little boy
over there.

381
00:33:08,125 --> 00:33:10,423
You think you'll ever
get married again?

382
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,264
- I mean, to anybody.
- No.

383
00:33:15,499 --> 00:33:16,864
Why?

384
00:33:18,369 --> 00:33:21,861
Maybe it's different if you don't
have children, but...

385
00:33:23,507 --> 00:33:27,637
even if Charley and I aren't living
together, and even if we're...

386
00:33:27,878 --> 00:33:32,941
sleeping with other people, even
if he were to get married again...

387
00:33:34,184 --> 00:33:35,845
he's still my husband...

388
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,180
and he's still the father of my
children and...

389
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:45,061
That stuff about "till death do you
part," that's really true.

390
00:33:45,362 --> 00:33:48,957
Let's say Charley finishes
his midlife crisis...

391
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:53,159
he's had it with his flings
and comes asking for forgiveness.

392
00:33:53,404 --> 00:33:55,031
What would you do?

393
00:33:59,143 --> 00:34:04,137
I think that if he really loved me...

394
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:06,815
he wouldn't have let me
divorce him.

395
00:34:15,926 --> 00:34:18,190
You still think about him, don't you?

396
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,755
Only all the time.

397
00:34:29,073 --> 00:34:31,541
- Think about Joanna?
- Never.

398
00:34:34,078 --> 00:34:35,909
Liar.

399
00:34:38,215 --> 00:34:40,274
Some pair, boy.

400
00:34:41,752 --> 00:34:43,014
I don't believe it.

401
00:34:43,253 --> 00:34:45,687
- You missed the closing.
- I'm sorry.

402
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:50,189
Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm getting very nervous here.

403
00:34:50,394 --> 00:34:53,557
Ever since your wife left you.
Is it eight months now?

404
00:34:53,797 --> 00:34:55,560
You're not getting any better.

405
00:34:55,799 --> 00:34:56,891
What do you mean?

406
00:34:57,134 --> 00:35:02,401
Look, I can't let your family problems
interfere with my responsibilities.

407
00:35:02,606 --> 00:35:03,868
I got a shop to run.

408
00:35:04,141 --> 00:35:07,736
I regret it, and I promise you
it will never happen again.

409
00:35:08,112 --> 00:35:09,272
Okay?

410
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:14,477
Yeah?

411
00:35:16,587 --> 00:35:17,747
Yeah, wait a minute.

412
00:35:17,988 --> 00:35:20,252
- It's for you, pick up 461.
- Who is it?

413
00:35:20,491 --> 00:35:22,823
Pick up 461.

414
00:35:25,462 --> 00:35:26,793
Yeah?

415
00:35:27,731 --> 00:35:30,131
Oh, hi, Billy. What's up?

416
00:35:30,667 --> 00:35:33,898
No, one hour of television a day.
That's the rule.

417
00:35:34,605 --> 00:35:35,799
No.

418
00:35:36,573 --> 00:35:40,509
I don't care what the other
mothers do, Billy. We made a deal.

419
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:42,904
I can't talk now. I'm busy.

420
00:35:43,747 --> 00:35:47,513
We will talk about it tonight
when I get home, all right?

421
00:35:47,751 --> 00:35:50,413
Double chocolate chip. I remember.

422
00:35:54,691 --> 00:35:56,249
I'm getting very nervous.

423
00:36:03,133 --> 00:36:05,328
Put that down and eat your dinner.

424
00:36:05,602 --> 00:36:07,035
What is this crap?

425
00:36:07,871 --> 00:36:10,135
- It's Salisbury steak.
- I hate it.

426
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,865
You had it last week and you loved it.

427
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:16,602
No, I didn't. I hate the brown
stuff. It's gross.

428
00:36:16,813 --> 00:36:19,213
- It's onions and gravy.
- I'm allergic to onions.

429
00:36:19,550 --> 00:36:21,882
You are not.
You had this last week...

430
00:36:22,219 --> 00:36:26,155
and I said it was my favorite and you
said, "It's my favorite too."

431
00:36:26,356 --> 00:36:28,051
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

432
00:36:29,293 --> 00:36:30,555
It's regular hamburger.

433
00:36:30,861 --> 00:36:32,453
Take a bite. It's delicious.

434
00:36:34,531 --> 00:36:35,531
What's the matter?

435
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:37,164
I'm gonna throw up.

436
00:36:37,401 --> 00:36:39,528
- No, you're not.
- It's yucky.

437
00:36:39,736 --> 00:36:42,671
It is not yucky, Billy. Eat it.

438
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,577
Did you bring the chocolate chip
ice cream home?

439
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:54,578
Yes, I brought the chocolate chip
ice cream home...

440
00:36:54,885 --> 00:36:58,321
and you can't have it until
you eat all your dinner...

441
00:36:59,156 --> 00:37:01,420
Where are you going?
Get back here now.

442
00:37:01,658 --> 00:37:03,057
Did you hear me?

443
00:37:03,327 --> 00:37:04,521
You'd better not do that.

444
00:37:05,362 --> 00:37:08,024
You'd better stop right there.
I'm warning you.

445
00:37:11,068 --> 00:37:12,092
Did you hear me?

446
00:37:14,571 --> 00:37:17,768
Now, you listen to me.
Don't be smart.

447
00:37:18,041 --> 00:37:20,441
Put that back until you finish
your dinner.

448
00:37:23,347 --> 00:37:26,282
If you take one bite out of that,
you're in trouble.

449
00:37:28,552 --> 00:37:31,180
Don't you dare.
Don't you dare do that.

450
00:37:31,421 --> 00:37:33,252
You hear me? Hold it right there.

451
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:38,493
You put that ice cream in your mouth
and you are in very big trouble.

452
00:37:38,762 --> 00:37:41,993
Don't you dare go anywhere
beyond that. Put it down.

453
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:46,431
I am not going to say it again.
I am not going to say it again.

454
00:37:49,539 --> 00:37:50,767
You're hurting me!

455
00:37:51,475 --> 00:37:52,703
Don't you kick me.

456
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:56,508
- I hate you!
- You're no bargain either, pal.

457
00:37:56,713 --> 00:37:59,011
You are a spoiled little brat!

458
00:37:59,283 --> 00:38:02,013
- I hate you!
- I hate you back, you little shit!

459
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:05,720
- I want my mommy!
- I'm all you've got.

460
00:38:06,957 --> 00:38:10,859
I want my mommy!

461
00:38:14,231 --> 00:38:16,825
I want my mommy!

462
00:38:22,906 --> 00:38:26,205
I want my mommy!

463
00:38:27,344 --> 00:38:29,141
Mommy...

464
00:39:22,799 --> 00:39:23,959
Daddy?

465
00:39:25,268 --> 00:39:26,268
Daddy?

466
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,561
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

467
00:39:29,906 --> 00:39:31,237
I'm sorry too.

468
00:39:34,544 --> 00:39:37,308
I want you to go to sleep
because it's really late.

469
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:40,041
Daddy?

470
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:41,978
Now what is it?

471
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:44,252
Are you going away?

472
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:46,222
No.

473
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:50,226
I'm staying here with you.
You can't get rid of me that easy.

474
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,754
That's why Mommy left, isn't it?
Because I was bad?

475
00:39:55,799 --> 00:39:57,164
Is that what you think?

476
00:39:58,902 --> 00:39:59,902
No.

477
00:40:01,171 --> 00:40:05,267
That's not it, Billy.
Your mom loves you very much...

478
00:40:05,475 --> 00:40:09,241
and the reason she left has
nothing to do with you.

479
00:40:11,248 --> 00:40:16,185
I don't know if this will make sense,
but I'll try to explain it to you.

480
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:22,114
I think the reason why Mommy left...

481
00:40:23,093 --> 00:40:24,788
was because for a long time...

482
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:30,158
I kept trying to make her be
a certain kind of person.

483
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:35,927
A certain kind of wife that
I thought she was supposed to be.

484
00:40:36,173 --> 00:40:39,267
And she just wasn't like that.
She was...

485
00:40:40,477 --> 00:40:42,104
She just wasn't like that.

486
00:40:44,648 --> 00:40:49,745
I think that she tried for so long
to make me happy...

487
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,978
and when she couldn't,
she tried to talk to me about it.

488
00:40:54,658 --> 00:40:58,958
But I wasn't listening.
I was too busy, too wrapped up...

489
00:40:59,196 --> 00:41:01,426
just thinking about myself.

490
00:41:02,199 --> 00:41:06,602
And I thought that anytime
I was happy, she was happy.

491
00:41:06,803 --> 00:41:11,035
But I think underneath
she was very sad.

492
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,870
Mommy stayed here
longer than she

493
00:41:15,045 --> 00:41:17,479
wanted because she
loves you so much.

494
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:22,612
And the reason why Mommy
couldn't stay anymore...

495
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:25,185
was because she couldn't stand me.

496
00:41:25,956 --> 00:41:28,823
She didn't leave because of you.
She left because of me.

497
00:41:44,741 --> 00:41:48,404
Go to sleep now because
it's really late, okay?

498
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,680
Good night.

499
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:54,544
- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.

500
00:41:54,751 --> 00:41:56,343
See you in the morning light.

501
00:41:57,053 --> 00:41:58,577
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

502
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,982
I love you.

503
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,718
I love you too.

504
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:26,914
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen...

505
00:42:31,421 --> 00:42:33,446
welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

506
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,388
Welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

507
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,953
- With gruesome goblins.
- With gruesome goblins.

508
00:42:41,698 --> 00:42:43,359
And ghostly ghosts.

509
00:42:43,733 --> 00:42:47,396
And wicked witches
and spooky spooks.

510
00:43:01,284 --> 00:43:03,263
Tom, you and I both know
it's a violation of privacy laws.

511
00:43:03,287 --> 00:43:05,431
Tom, you and I both know
it's a violation of privacy laws.

512
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:09,414
Look, it doesn't make any difference.
It's name or likeness.

513
00:43:09,626 --> 00:43:13,392
I don't care. Tell them if they
want it, they have to pay for it.

514
00:43:13,630 --> 00:43:15,154
All right, bye-bye.

515
00:43:15,765 --> 00:43:16,765
Hello, Kramer.

516
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:19,095
Can you check the copy
on Mid-Atlantic?

517
00:43:19,302 --> 00:43:20,997
I think it's okay.

518
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:32,815
Yes.

519
00:43:34,985 --> 00:43:36,282
Yes, what?

520
00:43:38,855 --> 00:43:40,322
I'll have dinner with you.

521
00:43:47,497 --> 00:43:48,589
Thank you.

522
00:43:49,299 --> 00:43:50,789
You're welcome.

523
00:44:15,158 --> 00:44:16,158
Oh, shit!

524
00:44:16,359 --> 00:44:18,054
- I gotta go.
- What's the matter?

525
00:44:18,528 --> 00:44:19,528
I gotta go.

526
00:44:19,562 --> 00:44:22,656
- Want me to call a cab?
- No, I've got an 8:00 meeting.

527
00:44:22,866 --> 00:44:24,424
- Where you going?
- Bathroom.

528
00:44:24,634 --> 00:44:27,034
That's a closet.
Bathroom's over there.

529
00:44:27,637 --> 00:44:29,195
Yeah, you're right.

530
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:34,374
These morons are violating the FTC
regulations, and I have to make sure...

531
00:44:36,513 --> 00:44:37,741
Hi.

532
00:44:39,582 --> 00:44:42,073
- What's your name?
- I'm Phyllis Bernard.

533
00:44:42,318 --> 00:44:43,114
Who?

534
00:44:43,319 --> 00:44:47,517
I'm a friend, uh, business associate
of your father's.

535
00:44:49,092 --> 00:44:50,150
Oh, Jesus.

536
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:55,191
- Do you like fried chicken?
- Fried chicken? Very much.

537
00:44:55,498 --> 00:44:56,522
So do I.

538
00:44:59,402 --> 00:45:01,700
Well, it's really...

539
00:45:03,373 --> 00:45:05,034
It's nice seeing you and...

540
00:45:05,241 --> 00:45:06,435
- Bye.
- Bye.

541
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,748
Kramer, I just met your son.

542
00:45:13,049 --> 00:45:17,418
Come on, you're never going to do
this if you don't concentrate.

543
00:45:18,021 --> 00:45:22,856
All right, come on. Thattaboy.
Get your center.

544
00:45:23,059 --> 00:45:24,754
Okay? How's it feel?

545
00:45:25,095 --> 00:45:26,095
Good.

546
00:45:26,229 --> 00:45:30,393
Keep it going, keep it going!
That's terrific!

547
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:34,135
Don't stop! Billy, keep your
feet moving!

548
00:45:35,105 --> 00:45:37,437
Oh, that's terrific.
How do you feel?

549
00:45:37,707 --> 00:45:39,800
- Good!
- You look great!

550
00:45:46,816 --> 00:45:49,080
Don't go too far!

551
00:45:51,988 --> 00:45:56,391
- Yeah?
- And so the dog really hurt Tom.

552
00:45:56,626 --> 00:46:00,357
So Tom got so mad, he jumped in
the potato salad...

553
00:46:00,563 --> 00:46:02,724
and he pushed over the table.

554
00:46:02,932 --> 00:46:03,932
Yeah?

555
00:46:04,100 --> 00:46:05,761
- Then...
- Let me get your shoelace.

556
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:07,129
Then what happened?

557
00:46:07,337 --> 00:46:11,774
The big dog kept chasing him,
then he flipped the table.

558
00:46:11,975 --> 00:46:14,068
- With all the stuff coming down?
- Yeah.

559
00:46:14,477 --> 00:46:15,477
Then what happened?

560
00:46:15,645 --> 00:46:17,840
I don't want to be late for school.

561
00:46:18,148 --> 00:46:20,082
Here's your homework. Give me a kiss.

562
00:46:21,851 --> 00:46:23,148
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

563
00:46:31,694 --> 00:46:33,093
Taxi!

564
00:46:35,632 --> 00:46:36,860
Hi.

565
00:46:45,675 --> 00:46:47,653
Your babysitter answers,
wouldn't say where you were.

566
00:46:47,677 --> 00:46:49,757
Your babysitter answers,
wouldn't say where you were.

567
00:46:49,813 --> 00:46:51,371
Tell me where you were.

568
00:46:51,614 --> 00:46:52,638
Well...

569
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:57,181
my French professor finally
asked me out.

570
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,647
- When?
- The other day.

571
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:00,989
You had a date.

572
00:47:01,224 --> 00:47:03,283
I knew you were keeping
something from me!

573
00:47:03,526 --> 00:47:06,689
- I thought he was a pretty neat guy.
- Right.

574
00:47:06,996 --> 00:47:08,725
- So we go to dinner.
- Yeah?

575
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:10,863
I find out he's married.

576
00:47:11,568 --> 00:47:13,627
He's deep in analysis.

577
00:47:14,804 --> 00:47:17,466
- He's telling me his life story...
- Wonderful!

578
00:47:17,674 --> 00:47:20,234
And all I can think of
while I sit there...

579
00:47:20,476 --> 00:47:23,639
is that I'm paying a babysitter
$3.25 an hour...

580
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:25,914
to listen to his problems.

581
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:28,843
Daddy! Daddy, look!

582
00:47:29,085 --> 00:47:31,178
- Take that out of your hand.
- I'll get him.

583
00:47:32,188 --> 00:47:33,655
Did you hear me?

584
00:47:39,629 --> 00:47:41,824
Hold it, hold it!

585
00:47:43,867 --> 00:47:45,994
It hurts, Daddy.

586
00:47:48,671 --> 00:47:50,764
- Daddy, hurry.
- Okay.

587
00:47:55,845 --> 00:47:57,779
- I can't see, Daddy.
- Rest your head.

588
00:47:59,015 --> 00:48:00,380
Watch it!

589
00:48:03,019 --> 00:48:04,953
Daddy, please hurry.

590
00:48:05,555 --> 00:48:07,648
- We're almost there.
- Can't see in my eye.

591
00:48:07,891 --> 00:48:11,224
Let me see.
Where's the emergency room?!

592
00:48:19,903 --> 00:48:21,302
How did this happen?

593
00:48:21,537 --> 00:48:23,471
He fell off the jungle gym.

594
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,568
He had a plane in his hand.

595
00:48:25,808 --> 00:48:27,070
I'm just about through.

596
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:29,244
- Don't hurt him.
- I won't hurt him.

597
00:48:29,479 --> 00:48:32,243
Mr. Kramer, can I talk to you outside?

598
00:48:32,515 --> 00:48:33,846
Yeah. Can she come in?

599
00:48:34,150 --> 00:48:35,150
Margaret, come in.

600
00:48:35,818 --> 00:48:37,581
- Stay, Daddy.
- I'll be right back.

601
00:48:37,854 --> 00:48:40,687
- Daddy, stay.
- I'm just outside.

602
00:48:41,024 --> 00:48:42,252
It's all right, darling.

603
00:48:42,558 --> 00:48:44,025
I'm just talking to the doctor.

604
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:46,388
He'll be right back.

605
00:48:46,596 --> 00:48:47,596
I'm right here.

606
00:48:48,731 --> 00:48:49,823
Will he lose his eye?

607
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:53,491
No, but I have to take some stitches.

608
00:48:53,736 --> 00:48:54,736
How many?

609
00:48:55,772 --> 00:48:57,034
- About 10.
- What?

610
00:48:57,273 --> 00:49:00,834
Don't worry. There won't be
much of a scar.

611
00:49:01,444 --> 00:49:04,277
This will take about 15 minutes,
so step over here.

612
00:49:04,514 --> 00:49:06,004
I want to be in there with him.

613
00:49:06,215 --> 00:49:08,911
- You don't need to be in there.
- He's my son.

614
00:49:09,419 --> 00:49:12,115
If you're gonna do something,
I'm gonna be with him.

615
00:49:13,056 --> 00:49:15,354
Good boy. You're really brave.

616
00:49:25,768 --> 00:49:27,736
That was a big one.

617
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,771
Stop it.

618
00:49:42,719 --> 00:49:47,816
Okay, we're almost done now.
We're almost done now.

619
00:50:29,265 --> 00:50:30,265
How is he?

620
00:50:30,433 --> 00:50:33,459
He's okay. He's sleeping.

621
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:36,165
It's okay. I can do that.

622
00:50:38,274 --> 00:50:41,004
Ted, I'm so sorry.
I feel responsible.

623
00:50:41,319 --> 00:50:42,809
I don't know what happened.

624
00:50:43,354 --> 00:50:46,983
One minute he was there and the
next he was lying on the ground.

625
00:50:48,092 --> 00:50:49,650
Come on, Margaret.

626
00:50:50,328 --> 00:50:53,195
Now listen, I want
to ask you a favor, okay?

627
00:50:54,032 --> 00:50:56,330
It's a big favor.

628
00:50:56,668 --> 00:51:00,160
If something happened to me...
I'm not saying anything will...

629
00:51:00,405 --> 00:51:02,896
- but if a building fell on me...

630
00:51:03,341 --> 00:51:07,334
would you consider
taking care of Billy?

631
00:51:11,616 --> 00:51:15,143
I want you to know that I put
some thought into this...

632
00:51:15,353 --> 00:51:16,353
and I...

633
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:20,055
can't think of anybody else
I would trust with him.

634
00:51:20,725 --> 00:51:23,387
I know you'd be okay
with him because...

635
00:51:25,196 --> 00:51:26,925
you're a good mother.

636
00:51:32,603 --> 00:51:34,628
You're a lousy dishwasher.

637
00:51:36,774 --> 00:51:38,765
- All right?
- Okay.

638
00:51:48,052 --> 00:51:49,644
You're all right.

639
00:52:04,168 --> 00:52:06,136
Louise, you want to get that?

640
00:52:09,007 --> 00:52:11,908
Louise, it's ringing...
Yeah, hello.

641
00:52:13,144 --> 00:52:14,668
Yes, who is this?

642
00:52:19,083 --> 00:52:20,083
Joanna.

643
00:52:39,604 --> 00:52:40,604
Hi.

644
00:52:42,006 --> 00:52:43,371
- Hi.
- How are you?

645
00:52:43,608 --> 00:52:44,870
You look great.

646
00:52:47,045 --> 00:52:48,478
- How's your?
- What?

647
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:52,181
- I'm sorry.
- I was saying, how's your job?

648
00:52:52,483 --> 00:52:54,849
Fine. Vice president of nothing.

649
00:52:55,153 --> 00:52:56,347
No, really, it's great.

650
00:52:56,554 --> 00:52:58,886
- Would you like a drink?
- Whatever she has.

651
00:52:59,157 --> 00:53:00,181
- White wine.
- Wine.

652
00:53:01,125 --> 00:53:02,717
- How's Billy?
- He's terrific.

653
00:53:03,461 --> 00:53:07,158
He had a little accident in a
playground. He cut himself.

654
00:53:07,532 --> 00:53:10,365
It was scary.
I ran him to the hospital.

655
00:53:10,568 --> 00:53:12,900
He has a little scar,
but he'll be fine.

656
00:53:13,137 --> 00:53:15,503
I've been worrying
that it's my fault...

657
00:53:15,807 --> 00:53:19,038
Don't do that. You can't even
see it from a distance.

658
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:26,813
I sit in the coffee shop across
from his school and watch him.

659
00:53:27,018 --> 00:53:28,417
He got so big.

660
00:53:28,653 --> 00:53:30,052
You've been watching him?

661
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:32,516
I've been in New York for
about two months now.

662
00:53:32,723 --> 00:53:33,917
I didn't know that.

663
00:53:34,725 --> 00:53:36,215
Anyway...

664
00:53:36,727 --> 00:53:39,491
That's why I wanted
to talk to you today.

665
00:53:40,364 --> 00:53:45,233
Last time you saw me,
I was in pretty bad...

666
00:53:45,536 --> 00:53:47,197
- Shaky?
- Really bad shape.

667
00:53:47,438 --> 00:53:48,928
Yeah, I was.

668
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:50,440
I was.

669
00:53:51,375 --> 00:53:53,536
Well, you look lovely now.

670
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,271
- What?
- I have a whole speech.

671
00:53:58,583 --> 00:54:00,016
Go ahead.

672
00:54:04,288 --> 00:54:06,586
All my life I've felt like...

673
00:54:06,791 --> 00:54:10,022
somebody's wife or mother
or daughter.

674
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:14,197
Even when we were together
I never knew who I was.

675
00:54:14,699 --> 00:54:16,132
That's why I had to go away.

676
00:54:16,634 --> 00:54:19,762
In California, I think I found myself.

677
00:54:19,971 --> 00:54:21,529
I got myself a job.

678
00:54:21,906 --> 00:54:24,807
I got myself a therapist,
a really good one.

679
00:54:26,144 --> 00:54:30,604
And I feel better about myself
than I ever have in my whole life.

680
00:54:30,815 --> 00:54:33,249
I learned a lot about myself.

681
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:35,585
Such as?

682
00:54:37,655 --> 00:54:41,785
No, really, I'd really like to
know what you learned.

683
00:54:46,964 --> 00:54:50,957
I've learned
that I love my little boy.

684
00:54:52,270 --> 00:54:55,433
And that I'm capable of taking
care of him.

685
00:54:55,673 --> 00:54:57,163
What do you mean?

686
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:00,902
I want my son.

687
00:55:01,812 --> 00:55:02,938
You can't have him.

688
00:55:03,247 --> 00:55:05,511
Don't get defensive. Don't bully me.

689
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,115
I'm not getting defensive.

690
00:55:07,585 --> 00:55:09,246
Who walked out 15 months ago?

691
00:55:09,487 --> 00:55:11,682
I don't care. I'm still his mother.

692
00:55:12,023 --> 00:55:13,251
From 3000 miles away.

693
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:16,654
Because you sent post cards gives
you the right to come back?

694
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:18,658
I never stopped wanting him.

695
00:55:18,863 --> 00:55:20,490
What makes you sure he wants you?

696
00:55:20,932 --> 00:55:22,695
What makes you sure he doesn't?

697
00:55:24,202 --> 00:55:27,262
We're gonna sit here and
bat this back and forth.

698
00:55:27,471 --> 00:55:29,632
- It's like old times.
- You can't deny me...

699
00:55:29,941 --> 00:55:33,104
Don't tell me what I can or cannot do.

700
00:55:33,444 --> 00:55:36,709
- Don't talk to me that way.
- I anticipated this.

701
00:55:36,948 --> 00:55:39,246
Do what you have to.
I'll do what I have to.

702
00:55:39,483 --> 00:55:40,643
I'm sorry about this.

703
00:55:41,085 --> 00:55:42,746
Do what you have to do.

704
00:55:50,394 --> 00:55:54,091
I don't know the legal jargon for it,
but I think it's "desertion."

705
00:55:54,332 --> 00:55:59,497
I don't mean to tell you your job,
but I have an open-and-shut case.

706
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:04,002
There's no such thing as an open-and-
shut case where custody is involved.

707
00:56:04,842 --> 00:56:07,675
I'll bet your ex-wife
has already found a lawyer...

708
00:56:07,912 --> 00:56:10,938
who's advised her to move back
to establish residency.

709
00:56:11,182 --> 00:56:15,346
The burden is on us to prove
that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

710
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,112
That means I'll have to play rough.
If I play rough...

711
00:56:19,423 --> 00:56:22,654
you can bet they will too.
Can you take that?

712
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,860
Yes.

713
00:56:24,795 --> 00:56:26,956
And it's going to cost you $15,000.

714
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:29,857
That's if we win.

715
00:56:30,201 --> 00:56:32,829
If we go to appeal,
it'll cost you more.

716
00:56:34,138 --> 00:56:35,138
I understand.

717
00:56:37,041 --> 00:56:39,134
Now, how old is the child again?

718
00:56:39,443 --> 00:56:40,967
My son is 7.

719
00:56:41,212 --> 00:56:42,873
- That's tough.
- Why?

720
00:56:43,147 --> 00:56:47,311
In cases involving a child that young,
the court tends to side with her.

721
00:56:47,551 --> 00:56:48,848
She signed over custody.

722
00:56:49,053 --> 00:56:52,682
I'm not saying we don't have a shot,
but it won't be easy.

723
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:54,787
Do me a favor, will you?

724
00:56:55,026 --> 00:56:57,893
There's something I find useful
in matters like this.

725
00:56:58,195 --> 00:57:02,188
I sit down and I write out all
the pros and cons on an issue.

726
00:57:02,466 --> 00:57:03,990
Write them and look at them.

727
00:57:05,670 --> 00:57:07,797
<i>- I want you to do that, okay?
- Okay.</i>

728
00:57:08,039 --> 00:57:09,404
<i>And after that...</i>

729
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,303
<i>if you're really certain
you want to retain custody...</i>

730
00:57:13,511 --> 00:57:18,141
<i>then we'll go in there
and beat the pants off them. Okay?</i>

731
00:57:36,934 --> 00:57:40,426
I love you, Billy. I know you're
sleeping and can't hear me.

732
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:43,172
I love you with all my heart.

733
00:58:00,925 --> 00:58:02,517
Ted, you got a lunch?

734
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:07,194
Hi, Jim. I don't know. I was trying
to work this idea out here...

735
00:58:07,398 --> 00:58:09,696
Good. I'll pick you up at 1:00.

736
00:58:11,068 --> 00:58:12,296
Okay, you got it.

737
00:58:13,137 --> 00:58:16,106
So the other morning,
I'm at the refrigerator...

738
00:58:16,874 --> 00:58:19,104
getting Billy ready for school.

739
00:58:19,377 --> 00:58:22,813
I'm just in my underwear
and he notices I've lost weight.

740
00:58:23,047 --> 00:58:25,538
He comes in and pats me.
He comes to here.

741
00:58:25,783 --> 00:58:29,651
And he says, "Daddy, you've really
lost a lot of weight."

742
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,879
He looks up at me and he says,
"And it's all gone to your nose."

743
00:58:36,227 --> 00:58:37,990
He was so cute. You know?

744
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:39,295
You know, kids.

745
00:58:39,497 --> 00:58:41,465
It's delicious, want a taste?

746
00:58:41,665 --> 00:58:43,394
- I'm full.
- It's good.

747
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:45,567
Listen, Ted...

748
00:58:45,770 --> 00:58:50,469
I had a call from a friend
of mine over at another agency.

749
00:58:51,609 --> 00:58:55,136
The Mid-Atlantic people have
invited them to pitch the account.

750
00:58:55,346 --> 00:58:56,404
Why?

751
00:58:56,614 --> 00:58:59,082
They're not happy
with what we're doing.

752
00:59:00,317 --> 00:59:03,809
I think you should have them over
and I'll give a little tap dance.

753
00:59:05,122 --> 00:59:06,987
I got Norman working on it.

754
00:59:07,258 --> 00:59:08,816
Norman?

755
00:59:11,796 --> 00:59:14,026
You taking me off the account?

756
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,499
You don't like me anymore?

757
00:59:17,802 --> 00:59:19,667
It's not quite that simple.

758
00:59:22,473 --> 00:59:25,340
I think we're gonna have to
make a few changes here.

759
00:59:29,547 --> 00:59:31,174
You're firing me?

760
00:59:32,883 --> 00:59:35,113
Yeah, I'm letting you go, yes.

761
00:59:38,522 --> 00:59:39,522
Why?

762
00:59:39,623 --> 00:59:42,888
Now, look, Ted, this is
a very painful thing for me.

763
00:59:43,127 --> 00:59:47,188
I've been getting a lot of pressure
from the guys upstairs.

764
00:59:47,398 --> 00:59:49,332
There wasn't anything I could do.

765
00:59:49,533 --> 00:59:51,797
I think it's better this way.

766
00:59:52,002 --> 00:59:53,162
If I took your stripes...

767
00:59:53,404 --> 00:59:58,205
if I put you on a schlock account,
you'd hate it, and me for doing it.

768
00:59:58,476 --> 01:00:01,343
This way it's a clean break.
That's the best thing.

769
01:00:01,712 --> 01:00:04,203
You know my wife is fighting
for custody?

770
01:00:04,482 --> 01:00:06,814
You know that we're going to court?

771
01:00:07,084 --> 01:00:10,383
Do you know what my chances are
if I'm out of a job?

772
01:00:11,088 --> 01:00:13,215
I understand that you're upset...

773
01:00:13,424 --> 01:00:17,224
I don't want to beg, but I'm
asking you, please, as a friend.

774
01:00:18,362 --> 01:00:19,727
I'm asking you.

775
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:23,559
You're an extremely bright guy.
You've got a hell of a talent.

776
01:00:23,767 --> 01:00:27,703
You're gonna land on your feet.
You're gonna survive.

777
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:29,565
Teddy, look.

778
01:00:31,008 --> 01:00:33,101
I know you may be short on cash.

779
01:00:33,344 --> 01:00:35,778
No big hurry about paying this back.

780
01:00:36,180 --> 01:00:37,875
Shame on you.

781
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:32,731
Daddy, the phone's ringing.

782
01:01:33,637 --> 01:01:34,797
<i>- Mr. Kramer?
- Yes.</i>

783
01:01:35,005 --> 01:01:37,132
<i>- Hold on for Mr. Shaunessy.
- Ted.</i>

784
01:01:37,408 --> 01:01:39,000
John. What's happening?

785
01:01:39,276 --> 01:01:43,110
They set the court date.
I just heard today it's January 9th.

786
01:01:43,314 --> 01:01:47,148
I gotta tell you something.
I got fired today. They laid me off.

787
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,112
Yeah, I'm still here.
Ted, I won't lie to you.

788
01:01:53,357 --> 01:01:56,918
We don't have a hope of winning
if you're out of work.

789
01:01:58,028 --> 01:02:00,462
Yeah, listen, you tell that...

790
01:02:01,131 --> 01:02:04,259
You tell that party and you tell
that party's attorney...

791
01:02:04,501 --> 01:02:05,866
that I want a delay.

792
01:02:06,103 --> 01:02:07,832
Sorry, it's really too late.

793
01:02:08,472 --> 01:02:10,940
<i>- Fine. I'll have a job in 24 hours.
- How?</i>

794
01:02:11,175 --> 01:02:13,109
I'll have a job in 24 hours.

795
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,536
<i>This is the worst time
to look for work.</i>

796
01:02:45,809 --> 01:02:49,370
It's the holidays. We'll have
something for you by mid-February.

797
01:02:49,647 --> 01:02:51,877
- March, at the latest.
- I can't wait.

798
01:02:52,149 --> 01:02:54,811
Mr. Kramer, it's December 22.

799
01:02:55,185 --> 01:02:57,745
If you could just look
in your card catalogue.

800
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,691
I'll take anything.

801
01:03:07,765 --> 01:03:10,928
There might be something
at Norman, Craig and Kummel.

802
01:03:11,168 --> 01:03:12,897
What is it?

803
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:14,831
Something in the art department.

804
01:03:15,072 --> 01:03:16,403
You'd go back on the board.

805
01:03:16,607 --> 01:03:20,008
It's really a step down,
and a cut in salary of 5000.

806
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:21,871
You'll be happier if you wait.

807
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,038
Call them up, make an appointment
for me today at 4:00.

808
01:03:26,250 --> 01:03:27,842
It's the Friday before Christmas.

809
01:03:28,085 --> 01:03:29,382
It's still a workday.

810
01:03:29,787 --> 01:03:31,414
Nobody's gonna want to...

811
01:03:31,622 --> 01:03:33,351
Either you call them or I do.

812
01:03:33,557 --> 01:03:36,856
If I call them up, you don't get
a commission. Right?

813
01:03:37,094 --> 01:03:39,289
My, we are a hotshot, aren't we?

814
01:03:41,632 --> 01:03:42,724
Yes, we are.

815
01:03:49,139 --> 01:03:52,438
- Good afternoon.
- I'm Kramer. I have an appointment.

816
01:03:53,544 --> 01:03:55,569
I did all of the copy on that one.

817
01:03:58,649 --> 01:04:01,584
That was the most successful
ad campaign they ever had.

818
01:04:01,785 --> 01:04:05,380
I did the idea, the layout
and most of the copy on that one.

819
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:09,984
Mr. Kramer, I must say,
this is very impressive.

820
01:04:10,561 --> 01:04:12,153
I'd like to get back to you.

821
01:04:12,429 --> 01:04:16,058
Is there someone I should see
before you come to your decision?

822
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,568
Mr. Spencer, our creative director.

823
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:20,793
Why don't you let me see him now?

824
01:04:21,505 --> 01:04:26,238
He's leaving on vacation. I'll set
something up the moment he gets back.

825
01:04:26,477 --> 01:04:28,308
- I think...
- Have a nice holiday.

826
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:31,240
I'd like to see him before he leaves.

827
01:04:32,349 --> 01:04:35,750
- Mr. Kramer, I don't...
- I want this position very much.

828
01:04:38,856 --> 01:04:39,856
Wait here.

829
01:05:10,687 --> 01:05:12,314
Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.

830
01:05:12,623 --> 01:05:14,614
- How do you do?
- You got 10 minutes.

831
01:05:17,561 --> 01:05:22,328
You do understand that the salary is
$4800 less than you were making?

832
01:05:22,633 --> 01:05:24,066
Yes, I understand.

833
01:05:24,301 --> 01:05:28,203
Why are you interested in a position
for which you're overqualified?

834
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:29,697
I need the job.

835
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:33,999
Let me think. I'll let Jack know
and he'll get in touch with you.

836
01:05:34,478 --> 01:05:35,968
This is a one-day offer.

837
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:39,411
You saw my book,
you know I can handle the work.

838
01:05:39,683 --> 01:05:41,878
You're gonna have
to let me know today,

839
01:05:42,052 --> 01:05:43,713
not at the end of the holidays.

840
01:05:43,987 --> 01:05:46,717
If you want me,
make a decision right now.

841
01:05:53,597 --> 01:05:55,997
Could we talk privately for a moment?

842
01:05:56,233 --> 01:05:57,393
Yes, sir.

843
01:06:43,780 --> 01:06:48,376
Mr. Kramer, you got yourself a job.
Congratulations.

844
01:06:48,619 --> 01:06:49,916
Really?

845
01:06:51,889 --> 01:06:53,914
- Is he kidding?
- Welcome aboard.

846
01:06:54,157 --> 01:06:56,921
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thanks.

847
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:17,011
Merry Christmas.

848
01:07:30,427 --> 01:07:31,621
Come on.

849
01:07:36,133 --> 01:07:38,328
- What do you think?
- It's neat.

850
01:07:38,535 --> 01:07:40,935
- I told you.
- Where is everybody?

851
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:45,801
It's Saturday, so very few people
come in because it's a day off.

852
01:07:46,276 --> 01:07:47,868
Okay, push "up."

853
01:07:51,315 --> 01:07:53,510
Push the top button.
Very top button.

854
01:07:53,784 --> 01:07:55,183
Go ahead, jump.

855
01:07:58,822 --> 01:08:00,050
- Look at that!
- Neat!

856
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:01,689
You didn't know you were so high.

857
01:08:01,959 --> 01:08:04,689
What building is that?
That has the pointy top.

858
01:08:04,962 --> 01:08:06,452
That's the Chrysler.

859
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,527
You proud of me?

860
01:08:08,832 --> 01:08:10,026
How'd you get this job?

861
01:08:10,300 --> 01:08:13,326
I told them I wanted it.
What's that say?

862
01:08:13,537 --> 01:08:14,561
It says "Kramer."

863
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:16,839
Kramer. Who's that?

864
01:08:17,074 --> 01:08:19,008
- That's us.
- That's right.

865
01:08:19,209 --> 01:08:20,642
You want to see?

866
01:08:22,379 --> 01:08:24,404
Wow!

867
01:08:25,582 --> 01:08:28,346
- This is neat.
- You like it?

868
01:08:28,919 --> 01:08:30,147
Careful, careful.

869
01:08:30,387 --> 01:08:31,547
- I'm okay.
- Scare me.

870
01:08:31,755 --> 01:08:33,382
What's that building?

871
01:08:33,590 --> 01:08:36,320
That's the U.N. Building.
That's the East River.

872
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:38,425
Look across there. You see that?

873
01:08:38,662 --> 01:08:41,324
That's Queens.
Look way, way down there.

874
01:08:41,565 --> 01:08:42,998
- Know what that is?
- What?

875
01:08:43,200 --> 01:08:45,896
- Brooklyn.
- Where you lived when you were a kid?

876
01:08:46,203 --> 01:08:49,001
That's right,
and this is where I work.

877
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:53,165
Is this really your desk?

878
01:08:56,346 --> 01:08:58,177
Are you gonna get remarried?

879
01:08:58,382 --> 01:09:00,441
I hadn't thought about it.

880
01:09:00,951 --> 01:09:03,010
Are you gonna marry Phyllis?

881
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,245
No, we're just good friends.

882
01:09:09,059 --> 01:09:11,721
Are you and Mom ever
gonna get remarried?

883
01:09:12,629 --> 01:09:15,257
No, Mommy and me will never
be remarried.

884
01:09:15,766 --> 01:09:19,031
I bet if she saw this,
she'd remarry you.

885
01:09:22,272 --> 01:09:24,467
You're a con artist. We made a deal.

886
01:09:24,775 --> 01:09:26,800
You take a bath every night...

887
01:09:27,044 --> 01:09:30,104
and you wash that filthy hair
twice a week, right?

888
01:09:30,547 --> 01:09:31,547
- Right?
- Yeah.

889
01:09:31,615 --> 01:09:32,877
Okay.

890
01:09:33,116 --> 01:09:34,447
Promise, or you're not going.

891
01:09:34,951 --> 01:09:37,613
Did I have to
when Mommy was here?

892
01:09:37,888 --> 01:09:40,550
I don't care what you had
to do when Mommy...

893
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:45,556
Did I, Dad? Did I?

894
01:09:47,664 --> 01:09:48,926
Are you listening?

895
01:09:49,132 --> 01:09:51,965
We'll talk about it tonight
when I get home, okay?

896
01:09:52,169 --> 01:09:53,830
Come here, give me a kiss.

897
01:09:54,905 --> 01:09:57,237
- What?
- You're a terrific kid.

898
01:10:03,513 --> 01:10:05,344
He says, "There's the unicorn."

899
01:10:05,615 --> 01:10:08,277
And he goes underneath there,
and he says:

900
01:10:08,518 --> 01:10:10,748
"Crumbs, what's happening?

901
01:10:10,987 --> 01:10:12,614
The air supply has stopped.

902
01:10:12,923 --> 01:10:15,448
Thundering typhoons,
what are you doing?"

903
01:10:15,692 --> 01:10:18,024
"Resting. It's tiring work,
you know."

904
01:10:18,261 --> 01:10:19,751
What's the air supply?

905
01:10:19,996 --> 01:10:23,454
When you got two tanks on your back
and you can't get any air...

906
01:10:23,667 --> 01:10:25,862
you can drown,
so he's gotta have that.

907
01:10:26,169 --> 01:10:27,363
<i>Ted, John Shaunessy.</i>

908
01:10:27,604 --> 01:10:28,628
Hi, what's up?

909
01:10:28,839 --> 01:10:33,037
<i>I got a call from your wife's lawyer.
She wants to see the kid.</i>

910
01:10:33,443 --> 01:10:35,809
- She wants what?
- She's the mother.

911
01:10:36,012 --> 01:10:38,105
She's within her legal rights.

912
01:10:38,348 --> 01:10:42,546
<i>- How do I know she won't kidnap him?
- I don't think she'd bother...</i>

913
01:10:42,853 --> 01:10:45,117
suing if she's gonna kidnap him.

914
01:10:45,856 --> 01:10:48,723
Wait. I'm not so sure
about her mental health.

915
01:10:48,992 --> 01:10:52,291
<i>- What do you mean?
- She said she was seeing a shrink.</i>

916
01:10:52,496 --> 01:10:53,520
A psychiatrist.

917
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:55,163
Did you see her talk to walls?

918
01:10:55,365 --> 01:10:56,957
<i>I'm just saying, you know.</i>

919
01:10:57,200 --> 01:10:59,566
I'm just saying you don't
have a choice.

920
01:10:59,836 --> 01:11:03,169
Have Billy at the boat pond
in Central Park, Saturday at 10.

921
01:11:03,406 --> 01:11:05,533
<i>- Do I have to?
- Yes.</i>

922
01:11:06,643 --> 01:11:08,076
Thanks very much.

923
01:11:09,346 --> 01:11:12,679
Daddy, will you come on
and finish the story?

924
01:11:13,817 --> 01:11:16,012
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

925
01:11:19,756 --> 01:11:23,089
What happens if the guy drowns?
How do they find him?

926
01:11:23,827 --> 01:11:27,160
When you die, there's bubbles
that come up or something.

927
01:11:27,397 --> 01:11:28,659
Where did I leave off?

928
01:11:28,932 --> 01:11:31,423
You left off right there.

929
01:11:31,668 --> 01:11:33,260
"Thundering typhoons..."

930
01:11:36,006 --> 01:11:38,167
It's got an obstacle course and stuff.

931
01:11:38,408 --> 01:11:40,603
- The cars go really fast.
- How much?

932
01:11:40,844 --> 01:11:41,936
It's really neat.

933
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:43,612
It's neat.

934
01:11:44,381 --> 01:11:47,077
- Come here, I want you to look...
- Okay, okay.

935
01:12:02,465 --> 01:12:04,797
I'll have him back by 6.

936
01:12:05,802 --> 01:12:07,133
You got so handsome.

937
01:13:03,660 --> 01:13:08,097
Remember, we talked about it,
keep your answers short and succinct.

938
01:13:08,331 --> 01:13:11,767
Just tell the truth and it'll be
all right. Believe me.

939
01:13:14,337 --> 01:13:16,931
- She's here.
- Yeah, I know. I saw her.

940
01:13:17,173 --> 01:13:20,973
Whatever you do, try not to become
emotional, no matter what he says.

941
01:13:21,211 --> 01:13:24,806
You'll hear things that may upset you.
I don't want you to react.

942
01:13:25,282 --> 01:13:29,378
Persons having business with the
Supreme Court, State of New York...

943
01:13:29,686 --> 01:13:33,053
special term part five,
draw nigh and ye shall be heard.

944
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:38,023
This court is now in session.
Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.

945
01:13:54,978 --> 01:13:58,505
- Is the petitioner's attorney ready?
- I am, Your Honor.

946
01:13:58,748 --> 01:14:00,875
I would like to call Joanna Kramer.

947
01:14:01,184 --> 01:14:02,879
Motherhood, going for the throat.

948
01:14:03,186 --> 01:14:06,053
You swear to tell the truth
and nothing but the truth?

949
01:14:06,323 --> 01:14:07,654
I do.

950
01:14:13,897 --> 01:14:18,095
Now, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell
the court how long you were married?

951
01:14:18,368 --> 01:14:19,528
Eight years.

952
01:14:19,836 --> 01:14:23,101
And would you describe those years
as happy?

953
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:25,533
The first two, yes.

954
01:14:25,875 --> 01:14:29,367
But after that it became
increasingly difficult.

955
01:14:30,246 --> 01:14:34,615
Mrs. Kramer, did you hold a job
before you were married?

956
01:14:34,851 --> 01:14:38,343
Yes, I did.
When I first got out of Smith...

957
01:14:38,621 --> 01:14:43,615
<i>I worked in the art department of
Mademoiselle magazine for years.</i>

958
01:14:44,527 --> 01:14:48,088
Did you continue to work
after you were married?

959
01:14:48,298 --> 01:14:50,425
No. I did not.

960
01:14:50,700 --> 01:14:52,099
Did you wish to?

961
01:14:52,302 --> 01:14:57,296
Yes, but every time I talked to Ted...

962
01:14:57,540 --> 01:15:02,273
To my ex-husband about it,
he wouldn't listen.

963
01:15:02,579 --> 01:15:07,073
He refused to discuss it
in any serious way.

964
01:15:07,450 --> 01:15:10,010
He said that I
probably couldn't get a job...

965
01:15:10,220 --> 01:15:12,814
that would pay enough
to hire a babysitter.

966
01:15:13,123 --> 01:15:16,058
Tell me, are you employed
at the present time?

967
01:15:16,326 --> 01:15:18,794
I'm a sportswear designer
here in New York.

968
01:15:19,062 --> 01:15:21,553
And what is your present salary?

969
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:24,393
I make $31,000 a year.

970
01:15:24,801 --> 01:15:28,328
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

971
01:15:29,406 --> 01:15:31,670
Yes, I do, very much.

972
01:15:31,975 --> 01:15:34,808
And yet you chose to leave him.

973
01:15:35,745 --> 01:15:37,144
Yes.

974
01:15:43,353 --> 01:15:46,914
During the last five years
of our marriage...

975
01:15:48,658 --> 01:15:51,183
I was becoming more
and more unhappy.

976
01:15:51,861 --> 01:15:53,294
More and more troubled.

977
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:57,523
And I really needed
somebody to help me...

978
01:15:57,834 --> 01:16:00,860
but when I turned to Ted, he just...

979
01:16:01,938 --> 01:16:04,031
wasn't there for me.

980
01:16:04,641 --> 01:16:07,439
So we became more isolated
from one another...

981
01:16:07,644 --> 01:16:09,475
more and more separate.

982
01:16:10,146 --> 01:16:12,774
He was very involved in his career.

983
01:16:13,883 --> 01:16:18,013
And because of his attitude
towards my fears...

984
01:16:18,288 --> 01:16:21,724
and his inability
to deal with my feelings...

985
01:16:22,959 --> 01:16:25,393
I had come to have
almost no self-esteem.

986
01:16:26,896 --> 01:16:29,626
I was scared and I was very unhappy.

987
01:16:29,866 --> 01:16:32,334
In my mind I had no choice
but to leave.

988
01:16:34,204 --> 01:16:39,039
At the time I left, I felt that
there was something wrong with me...

989
01:16:39,542 --> 01:16:42,375
and that my son would be
better off without me.

990
01:16:44,147 --> 01:16:48,481
And it was only after I got
to California that I realized...

991
01:16:48,718 --> 01:16:52,814
after getting into therapy,
that I wasn't a terrible person.

992
01:16:55,558 --> 01:17:00,086
And just because I needed some kind
of creative or emotional outlet...

993
01:17:00,363 --> 01:17:03,594
other than my child,
that didn't make me unfit.

994
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:08,437
I would like to submit in evidence
a report by Mrs. Kramer's therapist...

995
01:17:08,705 --> 01:17:10,195
Dr. Eleanor Freedman.

996
01:17:10,406 --> 01:17:11,566
Objection, Your Honor.

997
01:17:11,841 --> 01:17:15,333
The report is irrelevant
and not binding on the respondent.

998
01:17:15,612 --> 01:17:16,670
Overruled.

999
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:21,776
Can you tell the court why
you are asking for custody?

1000
01:17:23,620 --> 01:17:25,747
Because he's my child...

1001
01:17:26,222 --> 01:17:28,588
and because I love him.

1002
01:17:30,093 --> 01:17:32,220
I know I left my son.

1003
01:17:33,563 --> 01:17:36,396
I know that
that's a terrible thing to do.

1004
01:17:39,936 --> 01:17:43,463
Believe me, I have to live with that
every day of my life.

1005
01:17:44,040 --> 01:17:46,201
But in order to leave him...

1006
01:17:46,876 --> 01:17:50,141
I had to believe it was
the only thing I could do...

1007
01:17:52,081 --> 01:17:54,379
and that it was
the best thing for him.

1008
01:17:54,651 --> 01:17:57,279
I was incapable of functioning
in that home.

1009
01:17:57,554 --> 01:17:59,545
And I didn't know...

1010
01:17:59,756 --> 01:18:02,054
what the alternative was...

1011
01:18:02,258 --> 01:18:05,489
so I thought it was not best
that I take him with me.

1012
01:18:05,762 --> 01:18:09,391
However, I have since
gotten some help...

1013
01:18:09,632 --> 01:18:14,126
and I have worked very, very hard
to become a whole human being.

1014
01:18:16,906 --> 01:18:19,568
I don't think I should be
punished for that.

1015
01:18:21,244 --> 01:18:24,145
I don't think my little boy
should be punished.

1016
01:18:24,647 --> 01:18:26,911
Billy's only 7 years old.

1017
01:18:27,784 --> 01:18:29,342
He needs me.

1018
01:18:30,286 --> 01:18:33,119
I'm not saying he doesn't
need his father...

1019
01:18:34,424 --> 01:18:37,086
but I really believe
he needs me more.

1020
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:43,365
I was his mommy
for five and a half years...

1021
01:18:44,267 --> 01:18:48,328
and Ted took over that role
for 18 months.

1022
01:18:52,675 --> 01:18:55,542
But I don't know how anybody
can possibly believe...

1023
01:18:55,812 --> 01:18:59,839
that I have less of a stake
in mothering that little boy...

1024
01:19:00,149 --> 01:19:02,310
than Mr. Kramer does.

1025
01:19:05,722 --> 01:19:07,349
I'm his mother.

1026
01:19:09,792 --> 01:19:11,487
I'm his mother.

1027
01:19:16,899 --> 01:19:17,957
Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

1028
01:19:18,368 --> 01:19:20,461
I have no further questions.

1029
01:19:22,538 --> 01:19:25,029
Now then, Mrs. Kramer...

1030
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:30,471
you say that you were married
for eight years, is that correct?

1031
01:19:32,582 --> 01:19:37,713
In all that time did your husband ever
strike you or physically abuse you?

1032
01:19:38,921 --> 01:19:40,149
No.

1033
01:19:40,356 --> 01:19:45,259
Did he ever strike or physically
abuse his child in any way?

1034
01:19:46,763 --> 01:19:49,857
Would you describe your husband
as an alcoholic?

1035
01:19:51,267 --> 01:19:52,757
A heavy drinker?

1036
01:19:53,703 --> 01:19:55,534
Was he unfaithful?

1037
01:20:02,912 --> 01:20:05,904
Did he ever fail
to provide for you in any way?

1038
01:20:08,418 --> 01:20:10,886
I can certainly see why you left him.

1039
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:12,587
Objection.

1040
01:20:14,857 --> 01:20:17,792
How long do you plan to live
in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

1041
01:20:18,227 --> 01:20:19,717
Permanently.

1042
01:20:21,464 --> 01:20:24,365
How many boyfriends have you had,
permanently?

1043
01:20:24,600 --> 01:20:26,864
Objection on grounds of vagueness.

1044
01:20:27,070 --> 01:20:28,435
I'll allow it.

1045
01:20:32,575 --> 01:20:33,633
I don't recall.

1046
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:36,578
More than three, less than 33,
permanently?

1047
01:20:36,813 --> 01:20:38,144
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1048
01:20:38,414 --> 01:20:40,575
The witness will answer, please.

1049
01:20:42,652 --> 01:20:44,313
Somewhere in between.

1050
01:20:44,587 --> 01:20:46,145
Do you have a lover now?

1051
01:20:50,159 --> 01:20:53,925
Your Honor, I would request a direct
answer to a direct question.

1052
01:20:54,163 --> 01:20:55,960
Does she have a lover?

1053
01:20:56,265 --> 01:20:59,928
I'll allow that.
The witness will answer, please.

1054
01:21:01,671 --> 01:21:03,901
Yes, I'm seeing someone now.

1055
01:21:04,173 --> 01:21:06,903
Is that... permanent?

1056
01:21:08,745 --> 01:21:09,803
I don't know.

1057
01:21:10,012 --> 01:21:12,572
We don't know
when you say permanently...

1058
01:21:12,849 --> 01:21:17,115
if you plan to live in New York,
or keep your child, for that matter...

1059
01:21:17,320 --> 01:21:22,121
since you've never done anything
that could be regarded as permanent.

1060
01:21:22,325 --> 01:21:26,694
Objection. I request the counsel be
prevented from harassing the witness.

1061
01:21:26,963 --> 01:21:28,157
Sustained.

1062
01:21:28,431 --> 01:21:30,797
I'll put it another way, counselor.

1063
01:21:31,367 --> 01:21:35,098
What was the longest personal
relationship in your life...

1064
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:37,932
outside of parents or girlfriends?

1065
01:21:40,343 --> 01:21:42,038
I suppose that would be my child.

1066
01:21:42,712 --> 01:21:45,374
Whom you've seen twice in a year.

1067
01:21:45,615 --> 01:21:49,346
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband...

1068
01:21:49,619 --> 01:21:53,316
wasn't he the longest
personal relationship in your life?

1069
01:21:56,859 --> 01:21:59,157
Would you speak up?
I couldn't hear you.

1070
01:22:00,196 --> 01:22:01,458
Yes.

1071
01:22:01,964 --> 01:22:03,556
How long was that?

1072
01:22:05,067 --> 01:22:08,332
We were married a year
before the baby...

1073
01:22:09,071 --> 01:22:10,538
and seven years after.

1074
01:22:10,807 --> 01:22:14,573
So you were a failure at the most
important relationship in your life.

1075
01:22:14,811 --> 01:22:16,472
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1076
01:22:16,679 --> 01:22:19,648
The witness's opinion on this
is relevant.

1077
01:22:20,516 --> 01:22:22,313
I was not a failure.

1078
01:22:22,985 --> 01:22:26,421
What do you call it, a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.

1079
01:22:26,989 --> 01:22:29,389
I consider it less my failure
than his.

1080
01:22:29,592 --> 01:22:31,150
Congratulations.

1081
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:35,228
You've just rewritten matrimonial law.
You were both divorced.

1082
01:22:35,431 --> 01:22:36,921
Objection!

1083
01:22:37,767 --> 01:22:41,259
Your Honor, I would like to ask
what this model of stability...

1084
01:22:41,571 --> 01:22:43,835
and respectability
has ever succeeded at.

1085
01:22:44,440 --> 01:22:49,275
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1086
01:22:51,514 --> 01:22:56,611
- It did not succeed.
- Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.

1087
01:22:56,919 --> 01:23:01,413
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1088
01:23:01,691 --> 01:23:03,181
Were you?!

1089
01:23:08,798 --> 01:23:10,060
<i>No.</i>

1090
01:23:15,438 --> 01:23:17,269
Is that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?

1091
01:23:24,747 --> 01:23:26,544
No further questions.

1092
01:23:30,553 --> 01:23:33,488
- Did you have to be so rough?
- Do you want the kid?

1093
01:23:33,789 --> 01:23:35,051
Daddy?

1094
01:23:35,958 --> 01:23:37,220
Daddy.

1095
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:40,495
- Yeah?
- What did you do when you were little?

1096
01:23:40,730 --> 01:23:42,129
The same things you do.

1097
01:23:42,431 --> 01:23:44,831
<i>Did you watch The Brady Bunch?</i>

1098
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,959
No, we didn't have any television.

1099
01:23:48,471 --> 01:23:50,063
You didn't?

1100
01:23:50,339 --> 01:23:52,068
We listened to the radio.

1101
01:23:52,308 --> 01:23:53,741
What else didn't you have?

1102
01:23:54,176 --> 01:23:55,939
We didn't have lots of things.

1103
01:23:56,145 --> 01:23:58,170
- Like?
- Like a lot of things.

1104
01:23:59,282 --> 01:24:00,340
What kind?

1105
01:24:03,419 --> 01:24:04,852
Come here.

1106
01:24:06,022 --> 01:24:07,649
We didn't have diet soda.

1107
01:24:07,924 --> 01:24:10,085
We had egg creams, which was
chocolate syrup...

1108
01:24:10,326 --> 01:24:12,794
seltzer water and a bit of
milk and you went...

1109
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:15,993
and you drank it
and it was delicious.

1110
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:18,689
We didn't have the Mets,
but we had the Brooklyn Dodgers.

1111
01:24:18,935 --> 01:24:21,870
We had the Polo Grounds
and Ebbets Field...

1112
01:24:22,104 --> 01:24:24,038
Boy, those were the days.

1113
01:24:24,273 --> 01:24:26,332
We didn't have the Volkswagens...

1114
01:24:26,542 --> 01:24:30,171
but we had all those different cars
with funny names on them.

1115
01:24:30,379 --> 01:24:32,813
We didn't have Burger King
or McDonald's.

1116
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:37,381
We had automats where you put a
quarter in and you'd get...

1117
01:24:37,687 --> 01:24:41,179
a piece of pie or a sandwich
you could see through a window.

1118
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:44,359
We didn't have graffiti,
but we had this guy Kilroy...

1119
01:24:44,994 --> 01:24:47,224
<i>Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.</i>

1120
01:24:47,496 --> 01:24:50,294
<i>He spends a great deal of time
with Billy.</i>

1121
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,492
He reads to Billy a lot.

1122
01:24:52,702 --> 01:24:56,365
They play together,
they talk all the time.

1123
01:24:57,206 --> 01:24:58,901
He's a wonderful father.

1124
01:24:59,175 --> 01:25:02,008
Thank you.
No further questions.

1125
01:25:02,244 --> 01:25:05,372
Mrs. Phelps, how long
have you known Joanna Kramer?

1126
01:25:05,748 --> 01:25:09,650
About six years, ever since she and
Ted moved into the building.

1127
01:25:09,885 --> 01:25:13,480
How often did you see
Joanna Kramer and her son?

1128
01:25:13,990 --> 01:25:18,222
I haven't seen them together now for
about a year and a half, but...

1129
01:25:18,427 --> 01:25:21,590
back then I saw them two or
three times a week.

1130
01:25:21,931 --> 01:25:24,525
My oldest daughter and Billy
play together.

1131
01:25:24,734 --> 01:25:28,898
Can you describe the relationship
between Joanna Kramer and her son?

1132
01:25:29,171 --> 01:25:30,171
It was good.

1133
01:25:30,606 --> 01:25:32,335
Joanna was a very good mother.

1134
01:25:32,575 --> 01:25:34,634
Both Ted and Joanna are very...

1135
01:25:34,844 --> 01:25:38,075
Did Mrs. Kramer discuss her
relationship with her ex-husband?

1136
01:25:38,848 --> 01:25:40,179
Yes.

1137
01:25:40,449 --> 01:25:43,282
Can you tell the court
exactly what she said?

1138
01:25:45,087 --> 01:25:47,248
Joanna wasn't happy
for many reasons...

1139
01:25:47,523 --> 01:25:52,051
Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer
was insensitive to his son's needs?

1140
01:25:56,065 --> 01:25:58,556
Would you answer the question?

1141
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:02,093
- I didn't hear you.
- Yes, but that was before...

1142
01:26:02,438 --> 01:26:05,032
Did you ever encourage
her to leave her husband?

1143
01:26:05,474 --> 01:26:06,805
No, I did not.

1144
01:26:09,612 --> 01:26:13,139
Several days before she left,
did you say to her:

1145
01:26:13,382 --> 01:26:17,478
"If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1146
01:26:19,255 --> 01:26:22,053
- I didn't think Joanna...
- Did you say to her:

1147
01:26:22,258 --> 01:26:25,591
"If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1148
01:26:26,929 --> 01:26:30,092
- Yes, but she was my friend...
- No further questions.

1149
01:26:31,467 --> 01:26:33,594
Mrs. Phelps, you may step down.

1150
01:26:33,836 --> 01:26:36,430
Joanna, things are not the same now.

1151
01:26:36,839 --> 01:26:38,272
Ted is not the same man.

1152
01:26:38,507 --> 01:26:41,305
- You don't know how hard he's tried...
- Mrs. Phelps!

1153
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,410
They're beautiful together.

1154
01:26:43,646 --> 01:26:45,477
The witness is asked to step down.

1155
01:26:45,681 --> 01:26:47,581
If you could see them together...

1156
01:26:47,783 --> 01:26:49,683
maybe you wouldn't be here now.

1157
01:26:49,919 --> 01:26:51,910
Mrs. Phelps, that will be all!

1158
01:26:57,593 --> 01:26:58,992
I'm sorry.

1159
01:27:01,497 --> 01:27:02,828
When you were talking...

1160
01:27:03,632 --> 01:27:08,365
When my ex-wife was talking about how
unhappy she was during our marriage...

1161
01:27:08,604 --> 01:27:11,266
most of what she said
was probably true.

1162
01:27:11,474 --> 01:27:13,772
There's a lot I didn't understand.

1163
01:27:14,510 --> 01:27:17,138
There's a lot
I'd do different if I could...

1164
01:27:17,513 --> 01:27:20,676
just like there's a lot you wish
you could change but can't.

1165
01:27:20,883 --> 01:27:24,216
Some things, once they're done,
can't be undone.

1166
01:27:25,354 --> 01:27:26,981
My wife...

1167
01:27:27,323 --> 01:27:32,158
My ex-wife says she loves Billy
and I believe she does.

1168
01:27:32,995 --> 01:27:35,520
But I don't think
that's the issue here.

1169
01:27:36,565 --> 01:27:38,658
If I understand it correctly...

1170
01:27:39,535 --> 01:27:43,232
what means the most here is
what's best for our son.

1171
01:27:43,739 --> 01:27:46,139
What's best for Billy.

1172
01:27:47,209 --> 01:27:49,074
My wife used to say to me:

1173
01:27:49,311 --> 01:27:52,542
"Why can't a woman have
the same ambitions as a man?"

1174
01:27:53,082 --> 01:27:54,674
I think you're right.

1175
01:27:54,984 --> 01:27:57,214
And maybe I've learned that much.

1176
01:27:57,419 --> 01:27:59,819
By the same token, I'd like to know...

1177
01:28:00,055 --> 01:28:05,015
what law says a woman is a better
parent simply by virtue of her sex?

1178
01:28:05,828 --> 01:28:08,991
I've had time to think about
what makes a good parent.

1179
01:28:09,265 --> 01:28:12,166
It has to do with constancy.
It has to do with patience...

1180
01:28:12,368 --> 01:28:13,892
listening to him...

1181
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,832
or pretending to listen
when you can't anymore.

1182
01:28:17,072 --> 01:28:20,337
It has to do with love,
like she was saying.

1183
01:28:20,676 --> 01:28:24,578
I don't know where it says a woman
has a corner on that market...

1184
01:28:24,780 --> 01:28:28,045
that a man has any less
of those emotions than a woman.

1185
01:28:28,284 --> 01:28:31,583
Billy has a home with me.
I've made it the best I could.

1186
01:28:31,854 --> 01:28:34,687
It's not perfect.
I'm not a perfect parent.

1187
01:28:34,924 --> 01:28:37,484
Sometimes I don't
have enough patience

1188
01:28:37,660 --> 01:28:39,924
and I forget that he's a little kid.

1189
01:28:40,296 --> 01:28:41,695
But I'm there.

1190
01:28:43,399 --> 01:28:47,563
We eat breakfast and he talks to me,
and then we go to school.

1191
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:52,070
At night we have dinner together and
we talk and I read to him and...

1192
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:57,038
And we built a life together
and we love each other.

1193
01:29:04,086 --> 01:29:06,054
If you destroy that...

1194
01:29:07,590 --> 01:29:09,956
it may be irreparable.

1195
01:29:17,833 --> 01:29:20,825
Joanna, don't do that, please.

1196
01:29:22,571 --> 01:29:25,802
- Don't do it twice to him.
- Thank you, Mr. Kramer.

1197
01:29:26,108 --> 01:29:27,666
No further questions.

1198
01:29:29,511 --> 01:29:31,911
How long have you
worked in advertising?

1199
01:29:32,147 --> 01:29:34,411
Ever since I graduated high school.

1200
01:29:35,684 --> 01:29:38,983
College, I mean.
I've been there about 15 years.

1201
01:29:39,388 --> 01:29:43,188
Would you say you've achieved a
certain status in your profession?

1202
01:29:43,392 --> 01:29:45,451
Yes, I have a good reputation.

1203
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:49,357
When you worked at Roth, Kane
and Donovan, what was your salary?

1204
01:29:49,565 --> 01:29:51,692
Around $33,000 dollars a year
when I left.

1205
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:54,562
Now you work at Norman, Craig
and Kummel?

1206
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:56,761
- Yes.
- What is your salary?

1207
01:29:57,373 --> 01:29:59,568
It's almost 29,000.

1208
01:29:59,775 --> 01:30:02,209
Could you be more specific?

1209
01:30:02,544 --> 01:30:04,774
I make $28,200.

1210
01:30:05,214 --> 01:30:07,205
28,200.

1211
01:30:07,816 --> 01:30:12,253
You're the only person who's working
his way down the ladder of success.

1212
01:30:12,454 --> 01:30:16,982
Objection. Your Honor, I ask that
counsel's last remark be stricken.

1213
01:30:17,293 --> 01:30:18,293
Sustained.

1214
01:30:18,427 --> 01:30:21,055
Is it true you were fired
from your previous job?

1215
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:25,926
- I was let go.
- Will you tell us why you were let go?

1216
01:30:26,402 --> 01:30:28,632
There was a difference
of opinion in policy.

1217
01:30:28,937 --> 01:30:33,499
Is it true your agency lost a major
account due to your negligence?

1218
01:30:33,976 --> 01:30:34,976
Objection!

1219
01:30:35,010 --> 01:30:37,808
I'm trying to establish
the witness's employment record.

1220
01:30:38,080 --> 01:30:40,412
He cannot hold a job.

1221
01:30:40,683 --> 01:30:42,241
I'll allow it, Mr. Shaunessy.

1222
01:30:43,319 --> 01:30:46,482
It's not unusual in advertising
for a client...

1223
01:30:46,755 --> 01:30:48,950
to change his mind
and go elsewhere...

1224
01:30:49,825 --> 01:30:53,488
Was it true you walked out on a
client during a major presentation...

1225
01:30:53,829 --> 01:30:56,855
saying that you had an appointment
with a teacher?

1226
01:30:57,132 --> 01:31:00,192
My son was sitting next to a kid
who was hitting and biting.

1227
01:31:00,469 --> 01:31:03,131
- Yes or no?
- Yes, but he bit my kid.

1228
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:07,535
Last spring, did you miss a deadline
on the Mid-Atlantic account...

1229
01:31:07,776 --> 01:31:10,336
causing your company a
great deal of embarrassment...

1230
01:31:10,546 --> 01:31:12,537
and considerable
financial liability?

1231
01:31:12,781 --> 01:31:15,545
On that day I had to go home
because my child was sick.

1232
01:31:15,784 --> 01:31:18,344
Did you or did you not
miss a deadline?

1233
01:31:18,620 --> 01:31:20,713
- My son was sick.
- Answer the question.

1234
01:31:20,989 --> 01:31:24,186
I'm trying to answer the question.
It's not yes or no.

1235
01:31:25,127 --> 01:31:27,357
- Yes or no?
- He had a 104 temperature!

1236
01:31:27,563 --> 01:31:30,157
He's lying there sweating!
I go home to him!

1237
01:31:30,799 --> 01:31:35,236
Mr. Kramer, I urge you to stop
or I'll have to hold you in contempt.

1238
01:31:41,310 --> 01:31:42,902
I missed the deadline.

1239
01:31:43,746 --> 01:31:46,579
- Do you have a violent temper?
- No.

1240
01:31:46,849 --> 01:31:48,817
- Objection.
- I withdraw the question.

1241
01:31:49,017 --> 01:31:52,043
- Do you consider yourself a fit parent?
- Yes, I do.

1242
01:31:52,321 --> 01:31:55,256
Is it true your child nearly lost
an eye while in your care?

1243
01:31:55,557 --> 01:31:57,115
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1244
01:31:57,326 --> 01:31:58,816
Answer the question.

1245
01:31:59,094 --> 01:32:01,324
He was in the playground,
on the jungle gym...

1246
01:32:01,597 --> 01:32:04,566
And fell and nearly lost an eye
while in your care.

1247
01:32:04,767 --> 01:32:06,098
He fell and cut himself.

1248
01:32:06,335 --> 01:32:07,927
Is it true you told your ex-wife...

1249
01:32:08,170 --> 01:32:11,867
you were responsible for the
injury that disfigured your child?

1250
01:32:12,174 --> 01:32:13,368
Did you tell her:

1251
01:32:13,842 --> 01:32:17,175
"When it happened I felt guilty.
I felt it was my fault"?

1252
01:32:17,413 --> 01:32:20,405
- Objection!
- I have concluded my questions.

1253
01:32:56,285 --> 01:32:57,309
Ted?

1254
01:32:58,921 --> 01:33:00,320
Ted?

1255
01:33:05,327 --> 01:33:10,390
I'm sorry. I mentioned the accident
to him two months ago...

1256
01:33:10,599 --> 01:33:13,659
and I never thought he would
bring it up, never.

1257
01:33:15,237 --> 01:33:16,602
Believe me.

1258
01:33:17,506 --> 01:33:21,806
I never would have mentioned it if
I thought he'd pull a thing like that.

1259
01:33:22,845 --> 01:33:24,107
I'm sorry.

1260
01:33:24,513 --> 01:33:25,810
I'm...

1261
01:33:37,292 --> 01:33:38,316
Ted.

1262
01:33:38,594 --> 01:33:40,619
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, let me help you.

1263
01:33:40,829 --> 01:33:42,091
Heard anything yet?

1264
01:33:42,331 --> 01:33:45,198
Any day. My lawyer says
no news is good news.

1265
01:33:45,501 --> 01:33:47,093
- Guess what.
- What?

1266
01:33:47,336 --> 01:33:49,930
Charley and I are talking about
getting back together.

1267
01:33:50,138 --> 01:33:52,834
Really?
Did he finally call you?

1268
01:33:53,041 --> 01:33:54,599
No, I called him.

1269
01:33:54,877 --> 01:33:56,003
How come?

1270
01:33:56,278 --> 01:34:00,442
I don't know. I got to thinking
about a lot of things since the trial.

1271
01:34:00,682 --> 01:34:01,682
And...

1272
01:34:02,451 --> 01:34:05,181
I don't think it'll work out,
but he seems to want it.

1273
01:34:05,454 --> 01:34:08,719
That's terrific.
How do you feel?

1274
01:34:08,957 --> 01:34:12,484
I don't know.
I feel scared, I guess.

1275
01:34:22,738 --> 01:34:24,672
- Hi.
- Hi.

1276
01:34:27,175 --> 01:34:28,472
I lost.

1277
01:34:29,811 --> 01:34:32,075
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1278
01:34:41,023 --> 01:34:42,320
What happened?

1279
01:34:43,659 --> 01:34:46,992
The judge went for motherhood
right down the line.

1280
01:34:47,996 --> 01:34:52,160
"Ordered and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody..."

1281
01:34:52,434 --> 01:34:54,698
effective Monday,
the 23rd of January...

1282
01:34:55,070 --> 01:34:59,939
that the respondent pay for the
support of the child, $400 a month.

1283
01:35:00,208 --> 01:35:02,733
The father shall have the
following visitation rights:

1284
01:35:03,045 --> 01:35:06,742
Every other weekend, one night a
week to be mutually agreed upon...

1285
01:35:07,049 --> 01:35:09,847
"and one half of the child's
vacation period."

1286
01:35:10,085 --> 01:35:12,349
- That's it.
- What if I fight it?

1287
01:35:12,554 --> 01:35:14,419
I can't guarantee anything.

1288
01:35:14,623 --> 01:35:16,022
I'll take my chances.

1289
01:35:16,291 --> 01:35:18,589
- It'll cost you.
- I'll pay anything.

1290
01:35:19,294 --> 01:35:21,922
Look, Ted, I have to
tell you something.

1291
01:35:23,265 --> 01:35:25,961
This time it'll be Billy that pays.

1292
01:35:26,201 --> 01:35:28,294
I'll have to put him on the stand.

1293
01:35:28,770 --> 01:35:30,465
I can't do that.

1294
01:35:30,772 --> 01:35:32,763
No, I don't want to do that.

1295
01:35:35,544 --> 01:35:38,308
Thanks very much for your time.
I'm gonna take a walk.

1296
01:35:54,663 --> 01:35:57,154
Ted? It's me.

1297
01:36:02,471 --> 01:36:03,631
Ted?

1298
01:36:04,172 --> 01:36:05,730
I just heard.

1299
01:36:06,141 --> 01:36:07,802
Please go away.

1300
01:36:08,944 --> 01:36:10,935
Are you okay?

1301
01:36:12,514 --> 01:36:16,143
I just have to be by myself
for a while, Margaret.

1302
01:36:23,792 --> 01:36:24,850
I don't understand.

1303
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:28,095
The problem is your mom and I
both want you to live with us.

1304
01:36:28,330 --> 01:36:32,664
So that's why we decided to go see
this man, who is the judge...

1305
01:36:32,868 --> 01:36:36,326
and we let him decide because
he's very wise and experienced.

1306
01:36:36,538 --> 01:36:40,167
We talked to him for a few days
and then asked what he thought.

1307
01:36:40,442 --> 01:36:42,706
You know what?
He agreed with Mommy.

1308
01:36:42,944 --> 01:36:46,505
He thought it'd be terrific
if you lived with her from now on.

1309
01:36:46,782 --> 01:36:50,218
I'm lucky because I get to have
dinner with you once a week.

1310
01:36:50,485 --> 01:36:53,477
And twice a month
we spend the weekends together.

1311
01:36:55,057 --> 01:36:58,288
Where's my bed gonna be?
Where am I gonna sleep?

1312
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:02,721
Mommy's figured that all out. You
have your own bedroom at her place.

1313
01:37:04,199 --> 01:37:06,690
- Where will all my toys be?
- At Mommy's.

1314
01:37:06,902 --> 01:37:09,166
We're gonna take
all your toys over there.

1315
01:37:09,371 --> 01:37:12,465
If you play your cards right,
she'll buy you some new ones.

1316
01:37:13,575 --> 01:37:15,873
Who's gonna read me
my bedtime stories?

1317
01:37:16,311 --> 01:37:17,869
Mommy will.

1318
01:37:18,580 --> 01:37:21,071
You're not gonna kiss me
good night anymore?

1319
01:37:21,349 --> 01:37:23,579
No, I won't be able to do that.

1320
01:37:23,819 --> 01:37:27,255
But, you know, I get to visit.

1321
01:37:29,825 --> 01:37:32,350
It's gonna be okay. Really.

1322
01:37:32,561 --> 01:37:35,052
If I don't like it, can I come home?

1323
01:37:35,263 --> 01:37:36,855
What do you mean?

1324
01:37:37,099 --> 01:37:39,260
You'll have a great time with Mommy.

1325
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:41,867
Really. She loves you so much.

1326
01:37:42,404 --> 01:37:43,735
Dad?

1327
01:37:44,773 --> 01:37:48,334
Don't forget, once, if you can
just call me up, okay?

1328
01:37:54,850 --> 01:37:56,681
We're gonna be okay.

1329
01:38:01,523 --> 01:38:03,616
Let's go get some ice cream.

1330
01:39:43,325 --> 01:39:46,158
Come on, let's get
this show on the road.

1331
01:39:48,196 --> 01:39:50,164
Let's get a little hustle now, okay?

1332
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:52,162
Come on, set the table.

1333
01:40:00,842 --> 01:40:02,036
Come on.

1334
01:40:13,722 --> 01:40:15,155
Are you ready?

1335
01:40:33,575 --> 01:40:34,575
Yes?

1336
01:40:34,676 --> 01:40:37,270
<i>It's Joanna.
I'm downstairs in the lobby.</i>

1337
01:40:37,512 --> 01:40:39,946
<i>Can you come down here
and meet me alone?</i>

1338
01:40:47,022 --> 01:40:48,022
Hi.

1339
01:40:49,391 --> 01:40:50,585
What's up?

1340
01:40:55,030 --> 01:40:57,294
Tell me. What?
What's the matter?

1341
01:40:58,033 --> 01:40:59,967
I woke up this morning.

1342
01:41:03,905 --> 01:41:05,805
Kept thinking about Billy...

1343
01:41:06,074 --> 01:41:09,043
and I was thinking about
him waking up in his room...

1344
01:41:09,244 --> 01:41:12,042
with his little clouds
all around that I painted...

1345
01:41:12,280 --> 01:41:17,047
and I thought I should have
painted clouds downtown because...

1346
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:22,315
then he would think that
he was waking up at home.

1347
01:41:25,560 --> 01:41:28,757
I came here to take my son home.

1348
01:41:33,001 --> 01:41:35,435
And I realized he already is home.

1349
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:44,244
I love him very much.

1350
01:41:49,617 --> 01:41:51,915
I'm not gonna take him with me.

1351
01:42:00,829 --> 01:42:03,696
Can I go up and talk to him?

1352
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,158
Yeah.

1353
01:42:13,274 --> 01:42:16,710
Why don't you go upstairs
and see him and I'll wait here.

1354
01:42:28,123 --> 01:42:29,647
How do I look?

1355
01:42:31,793 --> 01:42:32,793
Terrific.
