1
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,997
I love you, Billy.

2
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,990
I love you too, Mommy.

3
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,394
Night-night.

4
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:12,903
Sleep tight.

5
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:18,093
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

6
00:02:19,784 --> 00:02:23,094
I'll see you in the morning light.

7
00:02:33,464 --> 00:02:35,102
I love you.

8
00:02:56,224 --> 00:02:59,341
And they're going to make me an assistant
art director. So my friend Kenny says:

9
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,978
"You take your first money and
you get yourself a Burberry coat."

10
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:05,694
He said, "If you're gonna be Madison Avenue,
you gotta look Madison Avenue."
I said, "All right."

11
00:03:05,904 --> 00:03:08,338
So Saturday afternoon, I go out,
and it's pretty cold.

12
00:03:08,584 --> 00:03:11,496
I go to this place in the fifties
where they specialize in Burberry's...

13
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,338
...and I go in there and I say,
"I want a Burberry coat, 37 short."

14
00:03:14,584 --> 00:03:17,337
So they put it on, and I look beautiful in it.
There's a three-way mirror, and I take a look,

15
00:03:17,584 --> 00:03:18,733
and I say, "All right, I'm going to buy it."

16
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:21,060
And right at that moment, I start to sweat.

17
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:25,177
But I take my checkbook out, and I start to
sign the check, and my hand shakes...

18
00:03:25,424 --> 00:03:27,142
...because I'm so scared of what I'm doing.

19
00:03:27,384 --> 00:03:28,783
- Good night fellas.
- Where you going?

20
00:03:29,024 --> 00:03:32,699
- I gotta get home.
- Oh, Jesus, I gotta go.

21
00:03:32,904 --> 00:03:34,178
All right, so let me finish.

22
00:03:34,424 --> 00:03:36,858
So I sign it, right?
and my hand starts shaking...

23
00:03:38,304 --> 00:03:41,740
Who is this? Danny, right?
Taxi!

24
00:03:41,984 --> 00:03:46,102
- Come on, come on, I gotta tell you something.
- I can't. I gotta get home.
- Forget it. Come on. Walk with me.

25
00:03:46,344 --> 00:03:48,938
Hey, listen, I gotta talk to you about
something important. Listen, Ted.

26
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:52,494
- I'm putting you in charge
of the Mid-Atlantic account.
- Me?

27
00:04:12,424 --> 00:04:15,416
- Right? - Right.
By the end of the year, we'll
have them up to 10 million.

28
00:04:15,417 --> 00:04:16,417
- Right?
- Right.

29
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:19,741
If this campaign works out the way
I know it will...

30
00:04:19,984 --> 00:04:21,781
...they're going to offer me a partnership.

31
00:04:21,984 --> 00:04:23,303
You never told me that. That's terrific!

32
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:27,702
When that happens, I just want you
to know I'm taking you along.

33
00:04:28,984 --> 00:04:32,772
Wow! Wow! That's terrific.

34
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:51,495
Joanna.

35
00:04:52,104 --> 00:04:53,742
I'm home.

36
00:04:56,704 --> 00:04:59,901
Hi. I forgot my keys. I just gotta call
the office before they go.

37
00:05:00,144 --> 00:05:03,500
Jo, you're gonna be real proud
of me. I got good news.

38
00:05:05,904 --> 00:05:08,702
- Ted.
- Yeah, one second. Let me just do this.

39
00:05:12,224 --> 00:05:15,341
You know Jack Edridge over in accounting?
He committed suicide.

40
00:05:15,584 --> 00:05:17,575
Yeah, hi. Ted Kramer.

41
00:05:17,824 --> 00:05:21,499
Listen. I gotta get those photos from
the re-toucher by tomorrow morning. Okay?

42
00:05:21,744 --> 00:05:24,338
- I'm leaving you.
- Honey, please. I can't hear. What?

43
00:05:25,944 --> 00:05:28,663
Okay, you too. Thanks a lot.
See you tomorrow.

44
00:05:29,264 --> 00:05:30,663
Did you guys eat?

45
00:05:30,904 --> 00:05:31,780
Ted, I'm leaving you.

46
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,781
Ted.

47
00:05:33,784 --> 00:05:34,784
Keys.

48
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:36,516
Here are my keys.

49
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:39,656
Here's my American Express,
here's my Bloomingdale's credit card...

50
00:05:39,864 --> 00:05:43,573
...here's my checkbook. I've taken
$2000 out of our savings account...

51
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,934
because that's what I had in the bank
when we first got married.

52
00:05:46,184 --> 00:05:48,823
- What's this, some kind of joke?
- Here's the cleaning, here's the laundry ticket.

53
00:05:49,064 --> 00:05:51,134
You can pick them both up
on Saturday.

54
00:05:51,344 --> 00:05:53,733
- You. You have to pick them up.
- Jo, you want to tell me what the matter?

55
00:05:53,984 --> 00:05:57,613
I paid the rent, I paid the Con Ed bill,
and I paid the phone bill, so...

56
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,536
Boy, you really pick your times to...

57
00:06:03,584 --> 00:06:07,293
Well, I'm sorry that I was late, but I was
busy making a living, all right?

58
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:11,181
Come on, okay? Can we stop now?

59
00:06:11,424 --> 00:06:13,460
So, that's everything.

60
00:06:14,461 --> 00:06:15,961
Hey.

61
00:06:15,962 --> 00:06:17,462
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey! Hey. Hey!

62
00:06:18,464 --> 00:06:20,102
Hey, enough, enough. All right?

63
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:22,255
What are you doing?

64
00:06:22,544 --> 00:06:25,980
Where are you going? Come on. Just tell
me what I did, that's all.

65
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:26,981
Just tell me what I did
that's so terrible.

66
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:28,598
- It's not you. It's not...
- Then what is it?

67
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:30,000
It's me. It's my fault.

68
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:31,543
You just married the wrong person,
that's all.

69
00:06:31,784 --> 00:06:34,139
- I can't hack it. I can't hack it.
- Fine. Let's just go inside. Please.

70
00:06:34,384 --> 00:06:36,340
I can't, I tried.
I swear...

71
00:06:36,584 --> 00:06:39,337
Joanne, please. Now, just... I'm sorry.

72
00:06:39,584 --> 00:06:44,499
No, don't you! Don't! Don't make me go in there.
Please. Please don't make me go in there.
Don't make me go in there.

73
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
We'll just talk.

74
00:06:45,544 --> 00:06:47,278
If you do, I swear, one day,
next week, maybe next year, I don't know...

75
00:06:47,384 --> 00:06:49,818
- ...I swear, I’ll go right out the window.
- Oh, please.

76
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:52,259
Now come on, now. What about Billy?

77
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:59,300
I'm not taking him with me.
I'm no good for him.

78
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,137
I'm terrible with him.

79
00:07:01,384 --> 00:07:04,103
I have no patience.

80
00:07:04,304 --> 00:07:06,295
He's better off without me.

81
00:07:08,384 --> 00:07:09,817
Joanne, please.

82
00:07:14,464 --> 00:07:16,694
And I don't love you anymore.

83
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:20,495
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

84
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:56,701
Hi, Margaret. This is Ted.
Is my wife there?

85
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:59,941
Yeah. Yeah. Joanna come in?

86
00:08:00,184 --> 00:08:04,302
Oh, I thought she might have come in.
We had a little fight a couple of hours ago, and I thought
she might have stopped by.

87
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:07,701
If she comes in, tell her to come up
here or just give me a ring, all right. Yeah.

88
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:13,497
Well, I wouldn't worry about it. She didn't take
her suitcase. I don't think she's going to get very far.

89
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:17,821
Yeah, I got a lot of work to do. If she comes
in, tell her to give me a ring. Thanks a lot.

90
00:08:24,624 --> 00:08:26,103
About time.

91
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:31,777
You know what, Joanna, that's the most insensitive thing...
Oh, hi, Margaret.

92
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:35,699
- She packed her suitcase?
- Look, it's nothing serious, really.
I appreciate your concern, but I...

93
00:08:35,944 --> 00:08:38,021
She tell you where she was going?
She must have said something to you?

94
00:08:38,064 --> 00:08:40,703
- Look, you tell me.
- How would I know? I wasn't here.

95
00:08:40,944 --> 00:08:44,300
Well, obviously my wife and you have had
numerous conversations about my shortcomings...

96
00:08:44,504 --> 00:08:47,416
...which I have not been privy to.
And I would love to sit here and talk to you...

97
00:08:47,664 --> 00:08:50,781
...but somebody has to bring home the bacon, and
I have a major presentation in the morning...

98
00:08:51,024 --> 00:08:53,743
...and I just gotta get my work done.
So please allow me to...

99
00:08:53,984 --> 00:08:56,498
Ted, you don't seem to realize
we have a serious problem.

100
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:59,537
Wrong, Margaret. Me. I got the problem.
All you gotta do is...

101
00:08:59,784 --> 00:09:02,059
...go out the door, go downstairs,
and go back to bed.

102
00:09:02,464 --> 00:09:04,898
- Ted, the fact is Joanna...
- The fact is that for the last six months...

103
00:09:05,144 --> 00:09:08,580
...I've been spitting blood to get
this agency one of the biggest accounts it's ever had.

104
00:09:08,824 --> 00:09:10,815
And at five o'clock this afternoon,
we got the account.

105
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:15,896
At eight o'clock, I'm walking home with the vice president,
who tells me I'm going to be the next creative director of this department.

106
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:18,572
I come through this door
to share with my wife...

107
00:09:18,784 --> 00:09:22,333
...what is going to be one of the five best days
of my life, and she looks at me cool as a cucumber...

108
00:09:22,584 --> 00:09:25,098
...and tells me she doesn't want
to live with me anymore!

109
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:32,898
Can't you understand
what she's done to me?

110
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,599
Yeah.

111
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:38,094
She loused up one of the five
best days of your life.

112
00:09:41,864 --> 00:09:44,139
You're terrific. Boy, you're...

113
00:09:44,384 --> 00:09:46,295
Thanks very much, really.

114
00:09:47,904 --> 00:09:49,383
Sisterhood.

115
00:09:49,624 --> 00:09:51,740
I want to thank you for coming up here
and cheering me up, but you...

116
00:09:52,064 --> 00:09:53,941
I didn't come up here to cheer you up.

117
00:09:54,184 --> 00:09:56,015
I came up because I'm
concerned about Joanna.

118
00:09:56,244 --> 00:09:59,600
Yeah, maybe you can be concerned
in the privacy of your own apartment. Okay?

119
00:10:00,864 --> 00:10:05,016
It just occurs to me that Joanna and I never
had any problems until you and Charley split up.

120
00:10:05,264 --> 00:10:07,141
Oh, oh, oh, oh, I don't believe you.

121
00:10:07,384 --> 00:10:09,102
Do me a favor, just tell me the truth, okay?

122
00:10:09,344 --> 00:10:10,936
Did, did, did you set my wife up to this?

123
00:10:11,184 --> 00:10:13,015
No, I did not put Joanna up to this.

124
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:15,573
- Give her a little pep talk?
- No, I did not give her any pep talk.

125
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:17,735
Joanna and I talk a great deal, yes.

126
00:10:17,984 --> 00:10:20,020
And Joanna is a very, very unhappy woman.

127
00:10:20,264 --> 00:10:24,542
And you may not want to hear this, but it took
a lot of courage for her to walk out of here.

128
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:27,696
Um-hmm. How much courage does
it take to walk out on your kid?

129
00:11:38,944 --> 00:11:40,297
Where's Mommy?

130
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:42,102
- Okay. What?!
- Where's Mommy?

131
00:11:42,304 --> 00:11:43,703
What time is it?

132
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:49,500
The little hand's on the 7, and the big
hand's on the 9. Where's Mommy?

133
00:11:51,264 --> 00:11:56,133
Oh, God. Okay. Okay, I'm gonna tell you.
You want to know where Mommy is?

134
00:11:56,344 --> 00:11:59,541
- She's supposed to take me to school.
- She told me to do it. It's okay.
- Where'd she go?

135
00:11:59,744 --> 00:12:01,621
I'll tell you precisely where she went.

136
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:05,373
- You know sometimes you and your friends
don't get along and you have a fight?
- Uh-huh.

137
00:12:05,584 --> 00:12:08,098
- And you want to go off be by
yourself for a while, right?
- Yep.

138
00:12:08,304 --> 00:12:10,864
Well, sometimes Mommy and Daddy
don't get along...

139
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:14,693
...and one of them wants to go off
and be by himself for a while.

140
00:12:14,904 --> 00:12:17,134
- When is Mommy coming back?
- Soon. Very soon.

141
00:12:17,384 --> 00:12:20,740
Come on, now, you and I are gonna have
some breakfast! Okay? Just you and me.

142
00:12:20,984 --> 00:12:23,020
- Okay. What do you want for breakfast?
- Some French toast.

143
00:12:23,384 --> 00:12:25,295
French toast. You want French toast, you got it.

144
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:28,541
Just put up a little water for Daddy
to have some coffee.

145
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:31,696
- And, we got how many eggs?
Two for you and two for me.
- Yep.

146
00:12:31,944 --> 00:12:32,933
We got milk.

147
00:12:33,184 --> 00:12:34,537
We got butter.

148
00:12:34,784 --> 00:12:36,502
We got five dollars.

149
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:39,093
I got five dollars.
Here, you sit here.

150
00:12:39,864 --> 00:12:42,503
Okay, can you be my number one helper?

151
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,413
Okay, now watch this. One hand.

152
00:12:46,184 --> 00:12:47,503
Here we go.

153
00:12:47,704 --> 00:12:50,623
Did you know that all the best chefs are men?
I bet you didn't know that, did you?

154
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,701
Isn't this terrific? This is terrific!
We gotta do this more often.

155
00:12:53,904 --> 00:12:56,293
- You dropped some shell in there.
- Ah, that's all right.

156
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,980
Makes it crunchier that way.
You like your French toast crunchy, don't you?

157
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:03,893
All right, I'll tell you what. Why don't you
beat 'em, and I'll get everything else going.

158
00:13:04,144 --> 00:13:06,021
- What time you have to be at school?
- 8:30.

159
00:13:06,264 --> 00:13:10,257
We gotta get the show on the road. 'Cause
I gotta shower and shave, shampoo my hair.

160
00:13:10,504 --> 00:13:11,539
And I got people to see.

161
00:13:11,784 --> 00:13:13,818
And Daddy's gotta bring home the bacon.

162
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:16,257
And not only does he bring home the bacon,
but he's gotta cook it, too, doesn't he?

163
00:13:16,264 --> 00:13:19,142
We're having a good time!
Now. Where does Mommy keep the...?

164
00:13:19,544 --> 00:13:21,580
- In the stove.
- The pan. In the stove. Okay.

165
00:13:23,784 --> 00:13:25,797
First thing we need is a nice hot fire.

166
00:13:26,144 --> 00:13:28,135
No, no, you're not doing it right.
Come here. Come here, you're not doing it right.

167
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:31,694
Look, you gotta do it fast. See?
It's the wrist. It's the wrist.

168
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:33,701
So the gucky part gets dissolved.

169
00:13:33,904 --> 00:13:37,533
Then you take the bread, and we...

170
00:13:37,784 --> 00:13:39,376
We...

171
00:13:40,304 --> 00:13:43,296
We fold it, that's what we do.
We fold the French toast.

172
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:46,934
- I think you forgot milk.
- I didn't. Milk comes last.

173
00:13:46,935 --> 00:13:48,435
You always gotta put the milk in last.

174
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:51,204
When you're having a good time,
you forget the most important things. Right?

175
00:13:51,384 --> 00:13:54,456
I just wanted to see if you were paying attention
'cause it's been a long time since I made this.

176
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:58,340
That's fun, isn't it? When's the last
time Mommy let you in the kitchen?

177
00:13:58,584 --> 00:13:59,983
I don't like it when it's in pieces.

178
00:14:00,224 --> 00:14:04,137
Look, the French toast tastes the same
whether it's in pieces or whether it's whole.
I mean, bread is bread. You know?

179
00:14:04,424 --> 00:14:06,699
Besides, what you don't know is,
is that French toast is always folded.

180
00:14:06,944 --> 00:14:10,016
You go into the best restaurants anywhere in
the world and you see folded French toast.

181
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:12,101
You get more bites that way. Right?

182
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:16,936
And while that's going, Daddy's gonna
make a little bit of coffee for himself.

183
00:14:17,184 --> 00:14:18,697
You having a good time?
Are ya'?

184
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:22,340
All right. We're having a great time.
I don't remember the last time I had,
I ever had such a good time.

185
00:14:23,264 --> 00:14:25,061
Daddy's making himself a little coffee.

186
00:14:25,304 --> 00:14:27,313
That's too much coffee!

187
00:14:27,314 --> 00:14:30,514
No, no, no, no. I like it strong.
And Mommy always makes it too weak.

188
00:14:32,024 --> 00:14:34,501
- Can I have some orange juice?
- Orange juice? Right.

189
00:14:34,704 --> 00:14:36,934
Right. One OJ coming up.
For the kid!

190
00:14:39,344 --> 00:14:40,743
Daddy, it's burning! It's burning!

191
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,096
- What?
- It's burning!

192
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:44,097
Oh, Jesus!

193
00:14:44,144 --> 00:14:47,422
Oh! Damn it!
Oh! God damn her!

194
00:14:50,824 --> 00:14:52,496
Oh, shit.

195
00:14:54,624 --> 00:14:58,219
Just take it easy. Everything's fine.
We're terrific. It's gonna be terrific.

196
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,897
Just...

197
00:15:01,224 --> 00:15:04,296
Just take it easy. Just take it easy.
Nothing's. Nothing's the matter.

198
00:15:07,864 --> 00:15:09,217
- What's the matter?
- Your hand's all sweaty.

199
00:15:09,464 --> 00:15:11,898
- When's Mommy coming back?
- Soon. I told you before. Very soon.

200
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:15,341
- Is she gonna pick me up after school?
- Probably. And if she doesn't, I will.

201
00:15:15,544 --> 00:15:17,341
- What if you forget?
- I won't forget.

202
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:20,781
- What if you get run over by a truck and
get killed? Then what happens?
- Then Mommy'll pick you up.

203
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:23,094
- Miss! What grade are you in?
- First.

204
00:15:23,304 --> 00:15:25,738
This is Billy Kramer.
He's in first grade.

205
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:28,219
Take care of him. I gotta
get a taxi, I'm a little late. Taxi!

206
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:30,337
Taxi!

207
00:15:33,024 --> 00:15:35,777
- Congratulations! That's really great about Mid-Atlantic.
- Oh, thanks, Norm.

208
00:15:36,024 --> 00:15:39,300
- Congratulations, Mr. Kramer.
- Thanks! Did I get that stuff
back from the re-toucher?

209
00:15:39,504 --> 00:15:41,734
- Great news, Ted.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot.

210
00:15:41,984 --> 00:15:43,593
- Good morning.
- Hi.

211
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,294
11:00 meeting with Airwick...

212
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,695
- Where's that stuff from the re-toucher?
- Right here. 12:30 with Occado on ground floor.

213
00:15:48,344 --> 00:15:49,697
- Did my wife call?
- No.

214
00:15:49,944 --> 00:15:53,095
All right, you're gonna have to cancel
the Airwick at 11:30, all right?

215
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:26,141
Well, I'll tell you, she's never gone
this far before, but in the past...

216
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:29,103
...you know, I've known
when she's upset because...

217
00:16:29,344 --> 00:16:30,936
...you know, she gets very quiet.

218
00:16:31,184 --> 00:16:34,574
And, uh, our pattern has been that
I've always said, "Honey, what's the matter?
Is something bothering you?"

219
00:16:34,784 --> 00:16:36,615
You know. And she'll kind of sit on it.

220
00:16:36,864 --> 00:16:39,776
But, I must admit that in the last two,
three weeks, maybe a couple of months...

221
00:16:39,984 --> 00:16:43,772
...ever since we've been going crazy
with this account, I've been remiss.

222
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:49,144
And, you know, I just didn't look at the writing
on the wall, so, you know, she's kind of...

223
00:16:49,664 --> 00:16:53,100
I think what she did last night was a way
of making me stop, look and listen, and say...

224
00:16:53,304 --> 00:16:56,340
- "Hey! You know, I'm just as
important as your work."
- Teddy!

225
00:16:57,544 --> 00:16:59,535
Is there another guy?

226
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:04,103
I don't think so. I mean, you know, that's.
She's not the type.

227
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:07,097
She's got this friend, Margaret,
downstairs, you know, and they...

228
00:17:07,784 --> 00:17:12,502
...you know, women's lib, and, uh.
I think they may have cooked this up. I...
Who knows? You know what I mean?

229
00:17:12,904 --> 00:17:13,893
It worked.

230
00:17:15,184 --> 00:17:16,537
I'm going crazy!

231
00:17:16,784 --> 00:17:18,900
Look, not to worry.

232
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:20,583
She'll be back.

233
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:23,099
I didn't know it would happen to me!

234
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:25,497
Don't let it get you down, kid.

235
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,054
No, I know she'll be back. Listen.
I'm terrific, really.

236
00:17:31,544 --> 00:17:34,263
- You do have a problem, Ted.
- Yeah, what's that?

237
00:17:37,064 --> 00:17:38,895
What are you gonna do about Billy?

238
00:17:40,584 --> 00:17:44,372
Well, this just happened last night.
You know, I'm sure when Joanna comes back...

239
00:17:44,584 --> 00:17:46,734
Okay, it's none of my business.
I'll butt out.

240
00:17:46,944 --> 00:17:49,458
No. No, no, no.
Listen, I want to hear your thoughts.

241
00:17:49,704 --> 00:17:52,741
I appreciate you
taking the time to talk to me.

242
00:17:53,424 --> 00:17:57,337
All right. May sound a little rough, but...

243
00:17:57,584 --> 00:18:01,702
...I think you ought to send Billy away
to stay with relatives for a while.

244
00:18:02,144 --> 00:18:04,499
You mean, until Joanna comes back?

245
00:18:05,304 --> 00:18:07,499
Suppose Joanna doesn't come back?

246
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:12,302
Gee, I don't know...

247
00:18:12,544 --> 00:18:14,023
Ted, listen to me.

248
00:18:14,264 --> 00:18:17,538
I just told the boys upstairs that you are
handling the Mid-Atlantic airlines account.

249
00:18:17,539 --> 00:18:19,539
I told them you're my main man, you know?

250
00:18:19,544 --> 00:18:23,935
Now, a gig like that just doesn't come
along once every five, six years.

251
00:18:24,184 --> 00:18:28,302
There's guys in this agency eating their hearts
out because I gave that spot to you.

252
00:18:28,504 --> 00:18:31,780
This is important. Don't blow this.

253
00:18:32,024 --> 00:18:35,699
I gotta depend on you. I gotta count
on you for 110 percent...

254
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:40,097
...7 days a week, 24 hours a day.
I gotta have that, Ted.

255
00:18:40,344 --> 00:18:43,654
I mean, I can't be concerned about you
worrying about a kid with a runny nose.

256
00:18:43,984 --> 00:18:46,693
First of all, you can count on me
25 hours a day,

257
00:18:46,694 --> 00:18:47,894
and you can count on me 8 days a week.

258
00:18:47,904 --> 00:18:49,701
Because I'm not a loser, Jim.
You know that.

259
00:18:49,944 --> 00:18:52,697
And I've never let anything at home,
you know, come into the office.

260
00:18:52,944 --> 00:18:55,139
You've asked me to unload on you, and that
takes place right here in this office.

261
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,899
When I go outside, I'm on top of it,
and I want you to know that.

262
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,413
I'm a survivor. Okay?

263
00:19:01,664 --> 00:19:05,293
You've given me a shot here.
I'm not gonna let anything blow it.

264
00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:08,103
Okay?

265
00:19:10,304 --> 00:19:13,102
Look, let's have a drink later.
Really, I'm all right. I gotta...

266
00:19:13,344 --> 00:19:15,494
...I gotta blow smoke up Airwick's ass,
you know. I got a 11:00.

267
00:19:15,744 --> 00:19:17,302
I'm all right! All right?

268
00:19:17,504 --> 00:19:18,937
You don't worry.

269
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:20,463
Thank you.

270
00:19:21,384 --> 00:19:23,500
I love you, you bastard.

271
00:19:28,144 --> 00:19:30,738
Daddy?

272
00:19:30,984 --> 00:19:32,702
Daddy?

273
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:35,703
Daddy?

274
00:19:35,744 --> 00:19:39,293
Yeah, honey, just wait a second.
I just want to finish this idea.

275
00:19:39,544 --> 00:19:42,183
Let me get this copy done,
and then I'll talk.

276
00:19:42,424 --> 00:19:46,497
What time is it when an elephant
sits on your fence?

277
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:49,894
Time to get a new fence.

278
00:19:53,184 --> 00:19:55,778
Honey, please, let me...
I just got this sentence.

279
00:19:56,144 --> 00:19:57,372
Daddy! Daddy!

280
00:19:58,224 --> 00:19:59,498
Goddamn it! Goddamn it!

281
00:19:59,704 --> 00:20:02,821
Get over there and sit
on that couch and don't move!

282
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:03,822
Goddammit!
Billy, I knew this was going to happen!

283
00:20:03,864 --> 00:20:05,624
I knew this was gonna happen!
I knew it!

284
00:20:05,864 --> 00:20:09,220
Who told you not to drink
this stuff here?

285
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:10,221
And you're supposed to have it
all at the dining room table, huh?

286
00:20:10,244 --> 00:20:11,543
- Sorry.
- Yeah, you're sorry.

287
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:14,138
I told you to keep that juice
in the dining room!

288
00:20:14,139 --> 00:20:15,139
You don't take anything
out here any more.

289
00:20:15,144 --> 00:20:16,493
Sorry.

290
00:20:16,984 --> 00:20:20,021
- Who took you to the park, and gave you
everything you wanted? Huh?
- You.

291
00:20:20,264 --> 00:20:22,380
- Who bought you an ice cream?
- You.

292
00:20:22,381 --> 00:20:23,381
Yeah.

293
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:27,812
And who promised Daddy that when
we got home, you would let him work,
and not bother him? Huh?

294
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:30,896
- That's ruined. I can't fix that.
- Sorry.

295
00:20:36,224 --> 00:20:39,296
Look, it's way past your bedtime.
Why don't you go to sleep, huh?

296
00:20:44,784 --> 00:20:47,298
And brush your teeth
and flush the toilet.

297
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:55,297
- We got paper towels. What else?
- We need some detergent.

298
00:20:55,544 --> 00:20:56,533
All right. Let's go.

299
00:20:56,784 --> 00:20:59,935
No, Mommy always buys the kind
with the orange circles on it.

300
00:21:00,184 --> 00:21:05,162
- But there's no difference between that
and this. It's all the same.
- Mom said it was the best.

301
00:21:07,504 --> 00:21:10,301
- Let's go.
- Get the pink stuff.

302
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,778
All right, come on.

303
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:16,492
- Okay?
- Okay. That's it. Hi.

304
00:21:16,504 --> 00:21:18,495
We need some cereal.

305
00:21:19,264 --> 00:21:20,902
Okay, what color?

306
00:21:30,224 --> 00:21:32,499
Hey, Billy!

307
00:21:32,704 --> 00:21:36,214
Billy! I told you Mommy would write
before the week was up.

308
00:21:36,264 --> 00:21:38,098
When's she coming back?

309
00:21:38,099 --> 00:21:41,099
Well, hold your horses.
That's what we're gonna find out right now.

310
00:21:41,104 --> 00:21:43,698
Okay. Let's read it.

311
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:51,903
"My dear, sweet Billy."

312
00:21:54,344 --> 00:21:55,902
That's you.

313
00:21:58,104 --> 00:22:00,095
"Mommy has gone away.

314
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,699
Sometimes in the world...

315
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,178
...daddies go away...

316
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:06,938
...and mommies bring up
their little boys.

317
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:09,937
But sometimes, a mommy
can go away too...

318
00:22:10,144 --> 00:22:13,136
...and you have your daddy
to bring you up.

319
00:22:13,384 --> 00:22:15,579
I have gone away
because I must find...

320
00:22:15,824 --> 00:22:19,533
...something interesting to do
for myself in the world.

321
00:22:19,784 --> 00:22:22,298
Everybody has to, and so do I.

322
00:22:26,064 --> 00:22:30,501
Being your mommy was one thing,
but there are other things too...

323
00:22:30,744 --> 00:22:33,577
...and this is what I have to do.

324
00:22:33,824 --> 00:22:36,133
I did not get a chance
to tell you this...

325
00:22:36,384 --> 00:22:39,023
...and that is why
I'm writing you now.

326
00:22:39,264 --> 00:22:41,698
I will always be your mommy...

327
00:22:43,224 --> 00:22:45,499
...and I will always love you.

328
00:22:46,224 --> 00:22:48,579
I just won't be your mommy
in the house...

329
00:22:48,824 --> 00:22:51,292
...but I'll be your mommy
at the heart.

330
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,613
And now I must go
and be the person I have to be."

331
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,502
We're gonna read this
another time. Okay?

332
00:23:02,704 --> 00:23:04,103
I don't care.

333
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:14,415
- Good night, Jim.
- Oh, hey Ted, come on.

334
00:24:14,784 --> 00:24:16,900
- Have a drink.
- Geez, I can't, I'm late now. I gotta, uh...

335
00:24:17,104 --> 00:24:20,699
Listen. What's the rush? We're having a little
party for Norman here. Five years in this dump.

336
00:24:20,904 --> 00:24:22,139
Can you believe it?

337
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:24,823
I really wish I could, but I'm late now.
I gotta pick up Billy.

338
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,901
Listen. You know Jerry Hoover,
over in media?

339
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:28,937
I'll tell you something very
funny that happened to him.

340
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:30,702
Gotta go. I'll see you Monday.

341
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:37,297
Taxi!

342
00:24:38,184 --> 00:24:39,617
Taxi!

343
00:24:42,664 --> 00:24:45,098
- Here, keep the change.
- Thanks.

344
00:25:02,264 --> 00:25:04,903
- Hi, you're Mrs.?
- Mrs. Kline.
- Hi, Mrs. Kline, I'm sorry I'm late.

345
00:25:05,144 --> 00:25:07,453
Oh, not, that's all right, but I'm
afraid Billy's a little upset.

346
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:10,095
Hey, how's it going, sport?

347
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:14,341
I had a little trouble
getting away from the office.

348
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:17,092
Sorry. Come on, let's get going.

349
00:25:17,904 --> 00:25:20,816
Thanks for coming, Billy.
Oh, wait a minute.

350
00:25:21,064 --> 00:25:23,862
- Don't forget your goody bag.
- Thanks very much.

351
00:25:24,144 --> 00:25:25,702
- Bye.
- Thanks a lot.

352
00:25:25,904 --> 00:25:29,294
- So, did you, did you have a lot of fun?
- You're late.

353
00:25:29,504 --> 00:25:32,223
- I'm not that late. I'm only 20 minutes.
- Want to make a bet?

354
00:25:32,224 --> 00:25:33,224
Yeah.

355
00:25:33,584 --> 00:25:36,303
All the other mothers were there
before you.

356
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:42,654
Why are you making such a big deal
of it? Hey, there was a lot of traffic.

357
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:48,614
If you want to be a big boy...

358
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:52,573
...you learn that when somebody says
they're sorry...

359
00:25:52,824 --> 00:25:57,818
...you don't hold a grudge
and make them feel bad for, you know...

360
00:25:58,064 --> 00:26:00,897
...a long time afterwards.

361
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:02,696
Okay, go ahead.

362
00:26:05,744 --> 00:26:08,383
Don't eat with your fingers.
Come on, Billy. Billy.

363
00:26:08,624 --> 00:26:11,696
You know better than that.
Here.

364
00:26:11,944 --> 00:26:13,297
Use a fork.

365
00:26:16,104 --> 00:26:18,902
Come on, come on.
Sit up, sit up, sit up.

366
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,496
How was school today?

367
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,536
Same as usual.

368
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:25,900
Hey, I see the Knicks finally won a game.
What do you know?

369
00:26:26,144 --> 00:26:27,896
I don't care.

370
00:26:28,104 --> 00:26:29,617
What do you mean?

371
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:32,742
- I like Boston.
- Boston? Why do you like Boston?

372
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:35,300
Because Mommy's from Boston.

373
00:26:39,704 --> 00:26:41,615
Okay, sit up and try to eat
some more. Come on.

374
00:26:41,864 --> 00:26:44,742
Can I be excused?
I want to go to bed.

375
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:46,303
Too much birthday cake?

376
00:26:46,504 --> 00:26:48,096
Yeah, I guess.

377
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:49,017
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

378
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:50,492
Louise? You want to give me a hand.

379
00:30:50,744 --> 00:30:52,097
You're 15 minutes late.

380
00:30:52,344 --> 00:30:54,733
- Mr. O'Connor is very upset.
- Okay. Is this all of it?

381
00:30:54,984 --> 00:30:58,897
- Yes. Do you want your mail now?
- No, I don't have time.
Just give me the messages.

382
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,998
- Mrs. Kelsey called. She'd like you
for Stephanie's birthday party...

383
00:31:00,999 --> 00:31:02,599
- Oh, Jesus! Remind me to get
a Crying Chrissie doll at lunch.

384
00:31:02,624 --> 00:31:03,898
- The 8 x 10's will be ready for next week.
- Okay, okay.

385
00:31:04,144 --> 00:31:04,974
Hi, sorry I'm late.

386
00:31:05,224 --> 00:31:09,297
Oh, and there's a PTA meeting
at the school on Tuesday at 4.

387
00:31:11,904 --> 00:31:13,132
Right, thanks very much.

388
00:31:13,384 --> 00:31:15,944
Put the chicken in the refrigerator.

389
00:31:18,144 --> 00:31:19,816
Know who Charley's seeing now?

390
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,019
Who?

391
00:31:21,904 --> 00:31:25,340
A divorced woman with two little girls
the same age as Kim and Petey.

392
00:31:25,584 --> 00:31:27,381
- Are you kidding? Are you kidding?
- No.

393
00:31:27,624 --> 00:31:28,579
How do you know?

394
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:30,576
I know.

395
00:31:30,824 --> 00:31:33,543
How long has it been since
you and Charley broke up?

396
00:31:33,784 --> 00:31:34,694
Year and a half.

397
00:31:34,904 --> 00:31:37,020
That long?

398
00:31:37,264 --> 00:31:39,255
Did I ever tell you how sorry,
how really sad...

399
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,376
...Joanna and I were
when you guys split?

400
00:31:43,344 --> 00:31:46,700
Look at that cute little boy
over there.

401
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:49,099
- You think you'll ever get married again?
- Uh-uh.

402
00:31:51,904 --> 00:31:53,735
- I mean, to anybody.
- No.

403
00:31:53,984 --> 00:31:55,303
Why?

404
00:31:56,744 --> 00:32:00,100
I don't know. Maybe it's different
if you don't have children, but...

405
00:32:01,664 --> 00:32:05,623
...even if Charley and I aren't living
together, and even if we're...

406
00:32:05,864 --> 00:32:10,699
...sleeping with other people, and even
if he were to get married again...

407
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:13,496
...I don't know, he's still my husband...

408
00:32:13,744 --> 00:32:16,702
...and he's still the father of my
children and...

409
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:22,338
That stuff about "till death do you
part," that's really true.

410
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:26,054
Well, let me ask you this: Let's say
Charley finishes his midlife crisis...

411
00:32:26,264 --> 00:32:30,098
and he's had it with his little flings and he comes
knocking on your door asking for forgiveness.

412
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:31,896
What would you do?

413
00:32:35,824 --> 00:32:40,614
I think that if he really loved me...

414
00:32:40,864 --> 00:32:43,173
...he wouldn't have let me
divorce him.

415
00:32:51,944 --> 00:32:54,094
You still think about him, don't you?

416
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:57,500
Only all the time.

417
00:33:04,504 --> 00:33:06,893
- Think about Joanna?
- Never.

418
00:33:09,304 --> 00:33:11,101
Liar.

419
00:33:13,264 --> 00:33:15,300
We're some pair, boy.

420
00:33:16,704 --> 00:33:17,898
I don't believe it.

421
00:33:18,144 --> 00:33:20,419
- You missed the closing.
- I'm sorry.

422
00:33:20,664 --> 00:33:24,782
Christ! Look, I gotta tell you something.
I'm getting very, very nervous here.
I've got to be honest with you about that.

423
00:33:24,984 --> 00:33:28,021
Ever since your wife left you.
What is it? Eight months now?

424
00:33:28,264 --> 00:33:29,936
You're not getting any better.
You're getting a hell of a lot worse.

425
00:33:30,184 --> 00:33:31,219
What do you mean?

426
00:33:31,464 --> 00:33:36,492
Look, look, I can't let your family problems
interfere with my responsibilities.

427
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:37,898
I got a shop to run.

428
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:41,580
Okay, look, I regret it, and I promise
you it will never happen again.

429
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:43,099
Okay?

430
00:33:46,944 --> 00:33:48,093
Yeah?

431
00:33:48,994 --> 00:33:49,994
Oh.

432
00:33:50,104 --> 00:33:51,219
Yeah, wait a minute.

433
00:33:51,464 --> 00:33:53,614
- It's for you, pick up 461.
- Who is it?

434
00:33:53,864 --> 00:33:56,094
Pick up 461.

435
00:33:58,584 --> 00:33:59,903
Yeah?

436
00:34:00,784 --> 00:34:03,093
Oh, hi, Billy. What's up?

437
00:34:03,664 --> 00:34:06,701
No, one hour of television a day.
That's the rule.

438
00:34:07,384 --> 00:34:08,499
No.

439
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:13,052
I don't care what the other
mothers do, Billy. We made a deal.

440
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:15,295
Look, I can't talk now. I'm busy.

441
00:34:16,144 --> 00:34:19,773
We will talk about it tonight
when I get home, all right?

442
00:34:19,984 --> 00:34:22,498
Double chocolate chip. I remember.

443
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,143
I'm getting very nervous.

444
00:34:34,744 --> 00:34:36,860
All right, come on.
Put that down and eat your dinner, okay?

445
00:34:37,104 --> 00:34:38,457
What is this crap?

446
00:34:39,304 --> 00:34:41,454
- It's Salisbury steak.
- I hate it.

447
00:34:41,664 --> 00:34:44,098
You do not hate it.
You had it last week and you loved it.

448
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:47,660
No, I didn't. I hate the brown
stuff. It's gross.

449
00:34:47,864 --> 00:34:50,173
- Okay, all that is is onions and gravy.
- I'm allergic to onions.

450
00:34:50,464 --> 00:34:52,739
You are not allergic to onions.
You had this last week...

451
00:34:53,064 --> 00:34:56,818
...and remember, I told you, it was my
favorite when I was a little boy and
you said, " It's my favorite too."

452
00:34:57,024 --> 00:34:58,662
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

453
00:34:59,824 --> 00:35:01,052
Here. It's regular hamburger.

454
00:35:01,304 --> 00:35:02,862
Just give it a little bite. It's delicious.

455
00:35:04,864 --> 00:35:05,819
Now what's the matter?

456
00:35:06,064 --> 00:35:07,383
I think I'm gonna throw up.

457
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:09,655
- No, you're not. Now you're gonna eat your...
- It's yucky.

458
00:35:09,864 --> 00:35:12,662
It is not yucky, Billy. Eat it.

459
00:35:17,504 --> 00:35:20,257
Did you remember to bring the
chocolate chip ice cream home?

460
00:35:21,424 --> 00:35:24,097
Yes, I did remember to bring the
chocolate chip ice cream home...

461
00:35:24,344 --> 00:35:27,654
...and you're not going to have any
of it until you eat all your dinner,
and eat your meat, and your corn, and...

462
00:35:28,424 --> 00:35:30,654
Where are you going?
Get back here right now.

463
00:35:30,864 --> 00:35:32,217
Did you hear me?

464
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,579
You'd better not do that.

465
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:36,984
You'd better stop right there, fella.
I'm warning you.

466
00:35:36,985 --> 00:35:38,485
Hey!

467
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,993
Did you hear me?

468
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:46,301
Now, you listen to me.
Don't be smart now.

469
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,899
You go right back and put that
back until you finish your dinner.

470
00:35:51,664 --> 00:35:54,962
All right, I'm warning you, if you take one
bite out of that, you're in big trouble.

471
00:35:56,664 --> 00:35:59,178
Hey! Don't you dare.
Don't you dare do that.

472
00:35:59,424 --> 00:36:01,176
Did you hear me?
Hey! Stop! Hold it right there.

473
00:36:01,544 --> 00:36:06,299
You put that ice cream in your mouth
and you are in very, very, very big trouble.

474
00:36:06,544 --> 00:36:09,661
Don't you dare go anywhere
beyond that. Put it down right now.

475
00:36:09,864 --> 00:36:13,903
I am not going to say it again.
I am not going to say it again.

476
00:36:13,904 --> 00:36:15,704
I am not!

477
00:36:15,705 --> 00:36:16,905
Owww! Owww!

478
00:36:16,906 --> 00:36:18,653
- You're hurting me!
- That's it. Owww!

479
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:20,838
Don't you kick me.
You hurt me.

480
00:36:20,904 --> 00:36:23,577
- I hate you!
- Yeah, well, you're no bargain either, pal.

481
00:36:23,784 --> 00:36:25,979
You are a spoiled, rotten little brat!
And I'll tell you right now...

482
00:36:26,224 --> 00:36:28,863
- I hate you!
- I hate you back, you little shit!

483
00:36:29,144 --> 00:36:32,375
- I want my mommy!
- I'm all you've got.

484
00:36:33,544 --> 00:36:37,298
I want my mommy!

485
00:36:40,544 --> 00:36:43,058
I want my mommy!

486
00:36:48,904 --> 00:36:52,055
I want my mommy!

487
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,862
Mommy...

488
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:47,459
Daddy?

489
00:37:48,704 --> 00:37:49,580
Daddy?

490
00:37:49,944 --> 00:37:51,855
- Yeah?
- I'm sorry.

491
00:37:53,144 --> 00:37:54,372
I'm sorry too.

492
00:37:57,544 --> 00:38:00,263
I want you to go to sleep
because it's really late.

493
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:01,564
Hey.

494
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:02,859
Daddy?

495
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:04,739
Now what is it?

496
00:38:05,544 --> 00:38:06,897
Are you going away?

497
00:38:07,824 --> 00:38:08,654
No.

498
00:38:09,344 --> 00:38:12,654
I'm staying here with you. You're
not going to get rid of me that easy.

499
00:38:13,064 --> 00:38:16,022
That's why Mommy left, isn't it?
Because I was bad?

500
00:38:17,984 --> 00:38:19,303
Is that what you think?

501
00:38:20,944 --> 00:38:21,774
No.

502
00:38:23,144 --> 00:38:27,057
No, that's not it, Billy.
Your mom loves you very much...

503
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:30,859
...and the reason she left doesn't
have anything to do with you.

504
00:38:32,864 --> 00:38:37,574
I don't know whether this is going to make
any sense, but I'll try to explain it to you, okay?

505
00:38:40,664 --> 00:38:43,098
I think the reason why Mommy left...

506
00:38:44,024 --> 00:38:45,662
...was because for a long time now ...

507
00:38:45,904 --> 00:38:50,819
...I kept trying to make her be
a certain kind of person, Nilly.

508
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:56,300
A certain kind of wife that
I thought she was supposed to be.

509
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:59,502
And she just wasn't like that.
She was...

510
00:39:00,704 --> 00:39:03,062
She just wasn't like that.

511
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:09,573
And now that I think about it, I think that
she tried for so long to make me happy...

512
00:39:10,304 --> 00:39:13,660
...and when she couldn't,
she tried to talk to me about it, see.

513
00:39:14,264 --> 00:39:18,416
But I wasn't listening, 'cause I was
too busy, I was too wrapped up...

514
00:39:18,664 --> 00:39:20,780
...just thinking about myself.

515
00:39:21,504 --> 00:39:25,736
And I thought that any time that I was
happy, that that meant she was happy.

516
00:39:25,944 --> 00:39:30,017
But I think underneath
she was very sad.

517
00:39:31,624 --> 00:39:36,175
Mommy stayed here longer than she wanted
to, I think, because she loves you so much.

518
00:39:37,544 --> 00:39:41,093
And the reason why Mommy
couldn't stay anymore...

519
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:43,539
...was because she couldn't stand me, Billy.

520
00:39:44,264 --> 00:39:47,562
She didn't leave because of you.
She left because of me.

521
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,853
Go to sleep now because
it's really late, okay?

522
00:40:08,024 --> 00:40:08,854
Good night.

523
00:40:09,144 --> 00:40:11,738
- Sleep tight.
- Don't let the bedbugs bite.

524
00:40:11,944 --> 00:40:13,457
See you in the morning light.

525
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:15,577
- Daddy?
- Yeah?

526
00:40:17,344 --> 00:40:18,857
I love you.

527
00:40:20,944 --> 00:40:22,457
I love you, too.

528
00:40:40,024 --> 00:40:42,777
- Ladies and gentlemen...
- Ladies and gentlemen...

529
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,060
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

530
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,859
...welcome to our Halloween Pageant.

531
00:40:52,424 --> 00:40:56,258
- With gruesome goblins.
- With gruesome goblins.

532
00:40:56,944 --> 00:40:58,502
And ghostly ghosts.

533
00:40:58,904 --> 00:41:02,374
And wicked witches and spooky spooks.

534
00:41:15,744 --> 00:41:19,498
Tom, don't give me that. You and I both
know it's a violation of privacy laws.

535
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:23,498
Look, it doesn't make any difference.
It's name or likeness. Okay?

536
00:41:23,744 --> 00:41:27,293
I don't care what they say. Tell them if they want
it, they going to have to pay for it, and that's it.

537
00:41:27,544 --> 00:41:29,057
All right, bye-bye.

538
00:41:29,624 --> 00:41:30,454
Hello, Kramer.

539
00:41:30,704 --> 00:41:32,820
- Can you check the copy on Mid-Atlantic?
- Sure.

540
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:34,662
I think it's okay.

541
00:41:45,024 --> 00:41:45,900
Yes.

542
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:49,292
Yes, what?

543
00:41:51,784 --> 00:41:53,183
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.

544
00:42:00,064 --> 00:42:01,099
Thank you.

545
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:03,217
You're welcome.

546
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,454
Oh, shit!

547
00:42:27,744 --> 00:42:29,336
- Kramer, I gotta go.
- What's the matter?

548
00:42:29,824 --> 00:42:30,620
I gotta go.

549
00:42:30,824 --> 00:42:33,782
- Want me to get you a cab?
- No, no. It's just, I've got an eight
o'clock meeting down on Center Street.

550
00:42:33,984 --> 00:42:35,497
- Where you going?
- The bathroom.

551
00:42:35,704 --> 00:42:37,979
That's a closet.
The bathroom's over there.

552
00:42:38,504 --> 00:42:40,062
Oh, yeah, you're right.

553
00:42:40,344 --> 00:42:45,020
It's just these morons are violating
the FTC regulations, and I have to
get down there and make sure...

554
00:42:47,064 --> 00:42:48,258
Hi.

555
00:42:50,024 --> 00:42:52,379
- What's your name?
- I'm Phyllis Bernard.

556
00:42:52,624 --> 00:42:53,420
Who?

557
00:42:53,624 --> 00:42:57,583
I'm a friend, uh, business associate
of your father's. Dad.

558
00:42:59,144 --> 00:43:00,133
Oh, Jesus.

559
00:43:01,424 --> 00:43:04,973
- Do you like fried chicken?
- Fried chicken? Very much.

560
00:43:05,224 --> 00:43:06,259
So do I.

561
00:43:09,024 --> 00:43:11,219
Well, I, it's really...

562
00:43:12,824 --> 00:43:14,382
It's nice seeing you and...

563
00:43:14,624 --> 00:43:15,773
- Bye.
- Bye.

564
00:43:19,424 --> 00:43:21,813
Kramer, I just met your son.

565
00:43:22,104 --> 00:43:26,256
Come on, hon, you're never going to do this,
Billy, if you don't, if you don't concentrate.

566
00:43:26,864 --> 00:43:31,460
All right, come on. Thattaboy.
Thattaboy. Get your center. Get your center.

567
00:43:31,704 --> 00:43:33,296
Okay? How's it feel?

568
00:43:33,664 --> 00:43:34,460
Good.

569
00:43:34,744 --> 00:43:38,737
Okay. Keep it going, keep it going!
Keep it going! That's terrific!

570
00:43:39,064 --> 00:43:42,295
Don't stop! Billy, keep
your feet moving!

571
00:43:43,264 --> 00:43:45,459
Oh, that's terrific!
How do you feel?

572
00:43:45,744 --> 00:43:47,780
- Good!
- You look great!

573
00:43:54,464 --> 00:43:56,659
Don't go too far!

574
00:43:59,464 --> 00:44:03,662
- Yeah?
- And so the dog really hurt Tom. -Yeah?

575
00:44:03,904 --> 00:44:07,453
So Tom got so mad, that he
jumped in the potato salad...

576
00:44:07,664 --> 00:44:09,734
...and he pushed over the table.

577
00:44:09,944 --> 00:44:10,820
Yeah?

578
00:44:11,064 --> 00:44:12,656
- And then...
- Let me get your shoelace.

579
00:44:12,864 --> 00:44:13,979
Then what happened?

580
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:18,382
And the little dog stopped chasing him, but
the big dog didn't, then he flipped over the table.

581
00:44:18,624 --> 00:44:20,660
- What? With all the stuff coming down?
- Yes.

582
00:44:21,024 --> 00:44:21,900
And then what happened?

583
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:24,260
Oh, I don't want to be late for school.
See you later.

584
00:44:24,504 --> 00:44:26,381
Wait a minute. Let me give you your
homework. Give me a kiss.

585
00:44:28,104 --> 00:44:29,332
- Hi, Tommy.
- Hi.

586
00:44:37,504 --> 00:44:38,857
Taxi!

587
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:42,458
Hi.

588
00:44:50,944 --> 00:44:54,698
Your babysitter answers, wouldn't
say where you were, or anything.

589
00:44:54,904 --> 00:44:56,417
Come on, tell me where you were.

590
00:44:56,624 --> 00:44:57,579
Well...

591
00:44:58,864 --> 00:45:01,981
Well, I, uh. My French professor
finally asked me out.

592
00:45:02,264 --> 00:45:04,300
- When?
- The other day.

593
00:45:04,664 --> 00:45:05,574
You had a date?

594
00:45:05,864 --> 00:45:07,820
I knew it! I knew you were keeping
something from me!

595
00:45:08,064 --> 00:45:11,101
Yeah, well, you know, I told you I
thought he was a pretty neat guy. Right?

596
00:45:11,102 --> 00:45:11,502
Right?

597
00:45:11,504 --> 00:45:13,176
- So we go to dinner.
- Yeah?

598
00:45:13,424 --> 00:45:15,255
- I find out he's married.
- Yeah?

599
00:45:15,944 --> 00:45:17,900
He's deep in analysis.

600
00:45:19,024 --> 00:45:21,538
- And get this. He starts to tell me his life story...
- Wonderful!

601
00:45:21,784 --> 00:45:24,252
...and all I can think of
while I'm sitting there...

602
00:45:24,464 --> 00:45:27,456
...is that I'm paying a babysitter
$3.25 an hour...

603
00:45:27,744 --> 00:45:29,541
-...to listen to his problems.
- Right!

604
00:45:29,904 --> 00:45:32,372
Daddy! Daddy, look!

605
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:34,654
- Billy, take that out of your hand.
- I'll get him.

606
00:45:35,124 --> 00:45:37,523
- You know, Charley isn't known...
- Did you hear me?
-...to be called generous with a buck

607
00:45:37,524 --> 00:45:39,024
Billy!

608
00:45:42,744 --> 00:45:44,860
Hold it, hold it!

609
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:48,860
It hurts, Daddy.

610
00:45:51,424 --> 00:45:53,415
- Daddy, hurry.
- Okay.

611
00:45:58,304 --> 00:46:00,135
- I can't see, Daddy.
- Rest your head.

612
00:46:01,304 --> 00:46:02,657
Watch it!

613
00:46:05,184 --> 00:46:07,015
Daddy, please hurry.

614
00:46:07,624 --> 00:46:09,580
- We're almost there.
- Can't see in my eye, Daddy.

615
00:46:09,864 --> 00:46:13,061
Let me see. Let me see.
Where's the emergency room?!

616
00:46:21,384 --> 00:46:22,703
Why don't you tell me
how this happened, huh?

617
00:46:22,944 --> 00:46:24,975
Well, he fell off the jungle gym.

618
00:46:25,024 --> 00:46:27,018
- Fell off the jungle gym?
- Well, he had a plane in his hand.

619
00:46:27,024 --> 00:46:28,252
I'm just about through.

620
00:46:28,464 --> 00:46:30,341
- Don't hurt him.
- I won't hurt him. Please.

621
00:46:30,544 --> 00:46:33,183
Mr. Kramer, can I talk to
you for a second outside?

622
00:46:33,424 --> 00:46:34,743
Yeah. Can she come in here?

623
00:46:34,824 --> 00:46:36,300
Margaret, you want to
come in here, please?

624
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:38,302
- Stay, Daddy.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

625
00:46:38,544 --> 00:46:41,297
- Billy, it's all right.
- Daddy, stay.
- I'm just outside.

626
00:46:41,584 --> 00:46:42,812
It's all right, darling.

627
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,503
I'm just talking to the doctor.
Okay?

628
00:46:45,624 --> 00:46:46,773
He'll be right back.

629
00:46:46,984 --> 00:46:47,894
I'm right here.
I'm right here.

630
00:46:49,024 --> 00:46:50,059
Is he going to lose his eye?

631
00:46:50,264 --> 00:46:53,574
No, he's not going to lose it, but I'm
going to have to take some stitches.

632
00:46:53,824 --> 00:46:54,700
What do you mean? How many?

633
00:46:55,784 --> 00:46:56,978
- About 10.
- What?

634
00:46:57,224 --> 00:47:00,660
Now don't worry about it. Because of the
position of the wound and the boy's age,
there won't be much of a scar.

635
00:47:00,661 --> 00:47:01,161
Okay.

636
00:47:01,224 --> 00:47:03,943
Now, this will take about 15 minutes,
so will you just step over here.

637
00:47:04,144 --> 00:47:05,577
No, if you're going to do something to
him, I want to be in there with him.

638
00:47:05,784 --> 00:47:08,344
- There's no reason for you to be in there, Mr...
- Yeah, there is. He's my son.

639
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:11,458
If you're gonna do something to him,
I'm gonna be with him.

640
00:47:12,304 --> 00:47:14,499
That's a good boy. You're really brave.
You know that?

641
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,500
Okay.

642
00:47:24,504 --> 00:47:27,381
That was a big one, huh?
That was a big one.

643
00:47:32,544 --> 00:47:34,136
Stop it.

644
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:37,937
Stop it.

645
00:47:38,938 --> 00:47:39,938
I don't want to.

646
00:47:40,784 --> 00:47:45,699
Okay, okay, we're almost done now.
We're almost done now.

647
00:48:25,384 --> 00:48:26,180
How is he?

648
00:48:26,504 --> 00:48:29,462
He's okay. He's sleeping.

649
00:48:29,944 --> 00:48:32,060
It's okay. I can do that.

650
00:48:34,064 --> 00:48:36,703
Ted, I'm so sorry.
I feel completely responsible.

651
00:48:37,104 --> 00:48:38,537
Well, I just don't know what happened.

652
00:48:39,064 --> 00:48:42,500
I mean, one minute he was there and the
next minute he was lying on the ground.

653
00:48:43,664 --> 00:48:45,097
Oh, come on, Margaret.

654
00:48:45,744 --> 00:48:48,463
Now listen to me, I want
to ask you a favor, okay?

655
00:48:48,464 --> 00:48:49,264
Okay?

656
00:48:49,304 --> 00:48:51,454
Not a little favor. It's a big favor.

657
00:48:51,824 --> 00:48:55,180
Now if something were to happen to me,
I'm not saying anything's going to happen...

658
00:48:55,384 --> 00:48:57,818
...but if, like, you know,
a building fell on me...

659
00:48:58,224 --> 00:49:02,058
...I just want to know if you would
consider taking care of Billy?

660
00:49:06,144 --> 00:49:09,534
I just want you to know that I put
some thought into this...

661
00:49:09,744 --> 00:49:11,340
...and I...

662
00:49:11,464 --> 00:49:14,262
...I can't think of anybody else
that I would trust with him.

663
00:49:14,904 --> 00:49:17,464
And I know you'd be okay
with him because you're a...

664
00:49:19,184 --> 00:49:20,856
...you're a good mother.

665
00:49:26,304 --> 00:49:28,260
You're a lousy dishwasher.

666
00:49:30,304 --> 00:49:32,215
- All right?
- Okay.

667
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:42,662
You're all right.

668
00:49:56,584 --> 00:49:58,461
Louise, you want to get that?

669
00:50:01,184 --> 00:50:03,982
Louise, it's ringing on eight...
Yeah, hello.

670
00:50:05,184 --> 00:50:06,663
Yes, who is this?

671
00:50:10,864 --> 00:50:11,819
Joanna.

672
00:50:30,544 --> 00:50:31,540
Hi.

673
00:50:32,864 --> 00:50:34,183
- Hi.
- How are you?

674
00:50:34,384 --> 00:50:35,658
You look great.

675
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,057
- How's your...?
- What?

676
00:50:39,058 --> 00:50:39,758
Huh?

677
00:50:39,824 --> 00:50:42,622
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Oh, I was just gonna say,
how's your job?

678
00:50:42,904 --> 00:50:45,179
Fine. Fine.
Vice President of nothing.

679
00:50:45,424 --> 00:50:46,573
No, really, it's going great.

680
00:50:46,824 --> 00:50:49,054
- Would you like a drink?
- Whatever she's having.

681
00:50:49,264 --> 00:50:50,299
- White wine.
- Wine.

682
00:50:51,184 --> 00:50:52,742
- How's Billy?
- He's terrific.

683
00:50:53,424 --> 00:50:56,973
He had a little accident a couple of weeks
ago in the playground and cut himself.

684
00:50:57,344 --> 00:51:00,063
It was really scary.
I ran him all the way to the hospital.

685
00:51:00,264 --> 00:51:02,494
He had a little teeny scar,
but he's, he'll be fine.

686
00:51:02,704 --> 00:51:04,979
I've been worrying
that it's my fault...

687
00:51:05,224 --> 00:51:08,341
No. Don't do that. Can't even
see it from a distance, I, I...

688
00:51:11,744 --> 00:51:15,817
Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across
the street from his school and watch him.

689
00:51:16,024 --> 00:51:17,343
He got so big.

690
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:18,943
You've been watching him
from the coffee shop?

691
00:51:19,184 --> 00:51:21,254
Well, I've been in New York for
about two months now, so.

692
00:51:21,464 --> 00:51:22,658
I didn't know that.

693
00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:24,857
Anyway...

694
00:51:25,344 --> 00:51:27,983
That's why I wanted to talk
to you today because, uhm...

695
00:51:28,824 --> 00:51:33,454
Last time you saw me,
I was in pretty bad...

696
00:51:33,784 --> 00:51:35,342
- Shaky?
- Really bad shape.

697
00:51:35,584 --> 00:51:37,063
Yeah, I was.

698
00:51:37,504 --> 00:51:38,380
I was.

699
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:41,454
Well, you look lovely now.

700
00:51:44,104 --> 00:51:46,015
- What?
- I have a whole speech.

701
00:51:46,264 --> 00:51:47,663
No, go ahead.

702
00:51:51,784 --> 00:51:53,979
All my life I've felt like...

703
00:51:54,184 --> 00:51:57,256
...somebody's wife or somebody's
mother or somebody's daughter.

704
00:51:57,504 --> 00:52:01,258
Even all the time we were together,
I never knew who I was.

705
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:03,143
And that's why I had to go away.

706
00:52:03,584 --> 00:52:06,621
And in California,
I think I found myself.

707
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,303
And I got myself a job.

708
00:52:08,664 --> 00:52:11,462
I got myself a therapist,
a really good one.

709
00:52:12,744 --> 00:52:17,022
And I feel better about myself
than I ever have in my whole life.

710
00:52:17,224 --> 00:52:19,499
And I've learned a great
deal about myself.

711
00:52:20,824 --> 00:52:21,734
Such as?

712
00:52:23,784 --> 00:52:27,743
No, I'm really, I'd really like to
know what you learned.

713
00:52:32,704 --> 00:52:36,538
Well, I've learned
that I love my little boy.

714
00:52:37,784 --> 00:52:40,821
And that I'm capable
of taking care of him.

715
00:52:41,064 --> 00:52:42,463
What do you mean?

716
00:52:45,024 --> 00:52:46,059
I want my son.

717
00:52:46,944 --> 00:52:48,013
You can't have him.

718
00:52:48,264 --> 00:52:50,459
Don't get defensive.
Don't try to bully me.

719
00:52:50,704 --> 00:52:52,023
I'm not getting defensive.

720
00:52:52,464 --> 00:52:54,256
Who walked out the
house 15 months ago?

721
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:56,420
- I don't care.
- Jo.
- I am still his mother.

722
00:52:56,744 --> 00:52:57,893
Yes, from 3000 miles away.

723
00:52:58,104 --> 00:53:01,176
And just because you sent a few post cards
gives you the right to come back here?

724
00:53:01,384 --> 00:53:03,102
I never stopped wanting him.

725
00:53:03,304 --> 00:53:04,862
What makes you sure
he wants you?

726
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:06,982
What makes you sure
he doesn't want me?

727
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:11,302
Okay, look, we're gonna sit here and bat this
back and forth like it was for eight years.

728
00:53:11,504 --> 00:53:13,620
- It's just like old times.
- Well, you can't deny me access...

729
00:53:13,824 --> 00:53:16,861
Don't tell me what
I can or cannot do.

730
00:53:17,184 --> 00:53:20,256
- Don't talk to me that way.
- I haven't anticipated this.
- Look, I don't want to get into this.

731
00:53:20,504 --> 00:53:22,734
You're gonna to do what you're gonna have to do.
And I'm gonna have to do what I have to do.

732
00:53:22,984 --> 00:53:24,099
I'm very sorry about this.

733
00:53:24,504 --> 00:53:26,096
Okay. Just do what you have to do.

734
00:53:33,424 --> 00:53:36,973
I don't know the legal jargon for it,
but I would think it's 'desertion.'

735
00:53:37,224 --> 00:53:40,173
I mean, I don't mean to tell
you your job, Mr. Shaunessey...

736
00:53:40,174 --> 00:53:42,374
...but I just think I have
an open-and-shut case.

737
00:53:42,424 --> 00:53:46,463
Well, first, Mr. Kramer, there's no such thing as
an open-and-shut case where custody is involved.

738
00:53:47,304 --> 00:53:50,023
Well, I'm willing to bet your ex-wife
has already found a lawyer...

739
00:53:50,224 --> 00:53:53,136
...and he's advised her to move back
to New York to establish residency.

740
00:53:53,384 --> 00:53:57,343
Now, the burden is on us to prove
that your ex-wife is an unfit mother.

741
00:53:57,584 --> 00:54:00,974
And that means I'll have to play rough.
And if I play rough...

742
00:54:01,224 --> 00:54:04,341
...you can bet they will too.
Can you take that, Mr. Kramer?

743
00:54:04,544 --> 00:54:05,533
Yes.

744
00:54:06,384 --> 00:54:08,454
And it's going to cost you $15,000.

745
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:11,299
That's if we win.

746
00:54:11,624 --> 00:54:14,138
If we go to appeal,
it'll cost you more.

747
00:54:15,344 --> 00:54:16,333
I understand.

748
00:54:18,184 --> 00:54:20,175
Now, how old is the child again?

749
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,937
My son is seven.

750
00:54:22,184 --> 00:54:23,776
- That's tough.
- Why?

751
00:54:24,024 --> 00:54:28,017
Well, in most cases involving a child that
young, the court tends to side with the mother.

752
00:54:28,264 --> 00:54:29,458
Bu, she signed over custody.

753
00:54:29,704 --> 00:54:33,140
I'm not saying we don't have a shot,
but it won't be easy.

754
00:54:33,424 --> 00:54:35,176
Mr. Kramer, do me a favor, will you?

755
00:54:35,424 --> 00:54:38,177
There's something I find very
useful in matters like this.

756
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:42,258
I sit down and I write out all
the pros and cons on an issue.

757
00:54:42,504 --> 00:54:44,017
I actually write them
down and look at them.

758
00:54:45,624 --> 00:54:47,660
I want you to do that, okay?

759
00:54:47,904 --> 00:54:49,178
And after that...

760
00:54:49,384 --> 00:54:52,933
...if you're really certain you want
to retain custody of your child...

761
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:57,535
...then we'll go in there and
beat the pants off them. Okay?

762
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:18,974
I love you, Billy. I know you're
asleep and can't hear me.

763
00:55:19,224 --> 00:55:21,533
I love you with all my heart.

764
00:55:37,324 --> 00:55:38,837
Yeah?

765
00:55:38,838 --> 00:55:40,638
Ted, you got lunch?

766
00:55:40,724 --> 00:55:44,823
Oh, hi, Jim. Gee, I don't know. I was
trying to work this idea out here...

767
00:55:44,824 --> 00:55:47,019
Good. I'll pick you up at 1:00.

768
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:49,493
Okay, you got it.

769
00:55:50,344 --> 00:55:53,142
Anyway, so the other morning,
I'm at the refrigerator...

770
00:55:53,904 --> 00:55:56,054
...and I was getting Billy
ready for school.

771
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:59,580
So I'm just in my underwear and
he notices I've, I've lost weight.

772
00:55:59,824 --> 00:56:02,179
And he comes in and pats me.
He comes to about here on me.

773
00:56:02,424 --> 00:56:06,178
And he says, " Daddy," He says,
"You've really lost a lot of weight."

774
00:56:06,424 --> 00:56:10,212
He looks up at me and he says,
"And it's all gone to your nose."

775
00:56:12,424 --> 00:56:14,176
He was so cute. You know?

776
00:56:14,424 --> 00:56:15,334
Well, you know. Kids.

777
00:56:15,584 --> 00:56:17,461
- This is delicious. You want a taste?
- Oh, no, thanks, Ted.
- Are you sure?

778
00:56:17,704 --> 00:56:19,342
- I'm full.
- It's good.
- Yeah.

779
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,381
Listen, Ted...

780
00:56:21,624 --> 00:56:26,140
...I had a call from a friend
of mine over at another agency.

781
00:56:26,141 --> 00:56:27,141
Right.

782
00:56:27,224 --> 00:56:30,580
The Mid-Atlantic people have
invited them to pitch the account.

783
00:56:30,824 --> 00:56:31,813
Why?

784
00:56:32,024 --> 00:56:34,333
I guess they're not happy
with what we're doing.

785
00:56:35,544 --> 00:56:38,934
I think maybe you should have them over
and I'll give a little tap dance. You know.

786
00:56:40,184 --> 00:56:41,981
No, it's okay.
I got Norman working on it.

787
00:56:42,224 --> 00:56:43,737
- Norman?
- Uh-huh.

788
00:56:46,544 --> 00:56:48,739
You taking me off the account?

789
00:56:50,704 --> 00:56:52,057
You don't like me anymore?

790
00:56:52,344 --> 00:56:54,441
It's not quite that simple.

791
00:56:56,824 --> 00:56:59,577
I think we're gonna have to
make a few changes, yeah.

792
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:02,678
You know. It's.

793
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:05,176
You're firing me?

794
00:57:06,824 --> 00:57:08,940
Yeah, I'm letting you go. Yes.

795
00:57:12,224 --> 00:57:13,020
Why?

796
00:57:13,224 --> 00:57:17,675
Now, look, Ted. This is a very painful thing
for me. You don't know how badly I feel.

797
00:57:17,724 --> 00:57:22,737
But, I've been getting a lot of
pressure from the guys upstairs.
And there wasn't anything else I could do.

798
00:57:22,784 --> 00:57:24,934
Listen, I thought about this a lot,
and it's really better this way.

799
00:57:25,144 --> 00:57:26,259
I mean, if I was to take
away your stripes...

800
00:57:26,504 --> 00:57:31,100
...if I was to put you on a schlock account,
you'd hate it. You'd hate me for doing it to you.

801
00:57:31,344 --> 00:57:34,397
This way it's, it's a clean break.
And believe me, that's the best thing.

802
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:36,858
You know that my wife is, is
fighting me for custody?

803
00:57:37,104 --> 00:57:39,334
You know that, that
we're going to court?

804
00:57:39,624 --> 00:57:42,775
Do you know what my chances are,
if I'm, if I'm out of a job?

805
00:57:43,424 --> 00:57:45,460
Now look, I understand that you're
upset, but for God's sakes.

806
00:57:45,704 --> 00:57:49,333
I don't want to beg, but I'm
asking you, please, as a friend.

807
00:57:49,334 --> 00:57:50,334
- Huh?
- Ted.

808
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:51,737
I'm asking you.

809
00:57:51,944 --> 00:57:55,380
You're an extremely bright guy. You
really are. You got a hell of a talent.

810
00:57:55,624 --> 00:57:59,333
You're gonna be okay. You're gonna land
on your feet. You're gonna survive.

811
00:57:59,624 --> 00:58:01,137
Teddy, look.

812
00:58:02,504 --> 00:58:04,540
I know you may be a little
short of cash right now

813
00:58:04,784 --> 00:58:07,139
No big hurry about
paying this back.

814
00:58:07,504 --> 00:58:09,142
Shame on you.

815
00:58:59,544 --> 00:59:01,739
Daddy, the phone's ringing.

816
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,623
Hello?

817
00:59:02,624 --> 00:59:03,739
- Mr. Kramer?
- Yes.

818
00:59:03,944 --> 00:59:05,980
- Hold on please for Mr. Shaunessy.
- Ted.

819
00:59:06,224 --> 00:59:07,782
Yeah, hi, John. How are you?
What's happening?

820
00:59:08,024 --> 00:59:11,699
Well, they set the court date.
I just heard today it's January 9th.

821
00:59:11,904 --> 00:59:16,533
Okay, look, I gotta tell you something.
I got fired today. They laid me off.

822
00:59:16,534 --> 00:59:17,534
Hello?

823
00:59:18,424 --> 00:59:21,257
Yeah, I'm still here.
Ted, I won't lie to you.

824
00:59:21,504 --> 00:59:24,940
We don't have a hope in hell of winning
a custody hearing if you're out of work.

825
00:59:26,024 --> 00:59:28,299
Yeah, yeah, listen, you tell that...

826
00:59:28,984 --> 00:59:31,976
You tell that party and you tell
that party's attorney...

827
00:59:32,224 --> 00:59:33,498
...that I want a delay in the court date.

828
00:59:33,744 --> 00:59:35,382
I'm sorry, Ted.
It's really too late.

829
00:59:36,024 --> 00:59:38,379
- Fine. I'll have a job in 24 hours.
- How the hell are you going to do that?

830
00:59:38,624 --> 00:59:40,421
I'll have a job in 24 hours.

831
01:00:08,984 --> 01:00:11,578
Of course you realize this is the worst
time of the year to look for work.

832
01:00:11,824 --> 01:00:15,260
It's the holiday season. Now I'm sure we'll
have something for you by mid-February.

833
01:00:15,504 --> 01:00:17,654
- March, at the latest.
- I can't wait. I have to have a job today.

834
01:00:17,904 --> 01:00:20,464
Oh, Mr. Kramer, it's December 22nd.

835
01:00:20,824 --> 01:00:23,258
I know it is. If you could
just look in your card catalog.

836
01:00:28,184 --> 01:00:29,936
I'll take anything.

837
01:00:32,904 --> 01:00:35,941
There might be something at Norman,
Craig and Kummel, but I don't know.

838
01:00:36,144 --> 01:00:37,816
What is it?

839
01:00:38,064 --> 01:00:39,656
- Something in the art department.
- Fine.

840
01:00:39,904 --> 01:00:41,132
- You'd have to go back on the board.
- It's all right.

841
01:00:41,344 --> 01:00:44,575
It's really a step down, and a
cut in salary of almost 5000 per year.

842
01:00:44,824 --> 01:00:46,382
I'm sure you'll be much happier
if you wait until after the first.

843
01:00:46,624 --> 01:00:50,378
Okay. Do me a favor. Call up Norman, Craig and
Kummel, make an appointment for me today at 4:00.

844
01:00:50,624 --> 01:00:52,137
It's the Friday before Christmas.

845
01:00:52,384 --> 01:00:53,578
Yeah, I know that, but it's
still a work day. Please.

846
01:00:54,024 --> 01:00:55,537
Nobody's gonna want to...

847
01:00:55,784 --> 01:00:57,376
Look. Either you call
them up, or I call them up.

848
01:00:57,624 --> 01:01:00,775
If I call them up, you don't get
a commission. Right?

849
01:01:01,024 --> 01:01:03,140
My, we are a hotshot, aren't we?

850
01:01:05,384 --> 01:01:06,873
Yes, we are.

851
01:01:12,544 --> 01:01:15,741
- Good afternoon.
- Hi, I'm Mr. Kramer. I have an
appointment to see Mr. Ackerman.

852
01:01:16,784 --> 01:01:18,740
I did all of the copy on that one.

853
01:01:21,704 --> 01:01:24,502
That was the most successful
ad campaign they ever had.

854
01:01:24,704 --> 01:01:28,140
And I did the idea, the layout
and most of the copy on that one.

855
01:01:29,544 --> 01:01:32,536
- Mr. Kramer, I must say,
this is very impressive.
- Thank you.

856
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:34,662
I would like to think about it
and get back to you.

857
01:01:34,904 --> 01:01:38,340
Is there someone I should see, Mr. Ackerman,
before you come to your decision?

858
01:01:38,904 --> 01:01:40,781
Mr. Spencer, our creative director.

859
01:01:41,024 --> 01:01:42,935
Why don't you let me
see him right away?

860
01:01:43,584 --> 01:01:48,335
Oh, I'm sorry, but he's leaving this
evening on a two-week vacation, but I'll
set something up the moment he gets back.

861
01:01:48,344 --> 01:01:50,141
- I think...
- Have a nice holiday.

862
01:01:50,384 --> 01:01:52,944
I tell you, I'd like to see him
right away before he leaves.

863
01:01:54,024 --> 01:01:57,255
- Well, Mr. Kramer, I don't...
- I want this position very much.

864
01:02:00,264 --> 01:02:01,174
Wait here.

865
01:02:30,784 --> 01:02:32,342
Mr. Kramer, Mr. Spencer.

866
01:02:32,584 --> 01:02:34,495
- How do you do?
- All right, you got ten minutes.

867
01:02:37,384 --> 01:02:41,935
You do understand that the salary
is $4800 a year less than you were
making at Roth, Cain, and Donovan?

868
01:02:42,184 --> 01:02:43,583
Yes, I understand.

869
01:02:43,824 --> 01:02:47,533
Mr. Kramer, do you mind if I ask you why
are you interested in a position for
which you're clearly overqualified?

870
01:02:47,984 --> 01:02:49,019
I need the job.

871
01:02:49,824 --> 01:02:53,134
Well, let me think about it. I'll let Jack
know and he'll get in touch with you.

872
01:02:53,624 --> 01:02:55,023
No, this is a one-day
only offer, Gentlemen.

873
01:02:55,224 --> 01:02:58,296
You saw my book, you know I can handle
the work. I'm willing to take a salary cut.

874
01:02:58,544 --> 01:03:02,457
The only thing is you're gonna have to
let me know today, not tomorrow, not
next week, not at the end of the holidays.

875
01:03:02,704 --> 01:03:05,298
If you really want me, you
make a decision right now.

876
01:03:11,944 --> 01:03:14,174
Mr. Kramer, could we talk
privately for a moment?

877
01:03:14,424 --> 01:03:15,539
Yes, sir.

878
01:04:00,064 --> 01:04:04,455
Mr. Kramer, you got yourself a job.
Congratulations.

879
01:04:04,704 --> 01:04:05,932
Really?

880
01:04:07,824 --> 01:04:09,780
- Is he kidding?
- Not at all. Welcome aboard.

881
01:04:10,024 --> 01:04:12,663
Thank you. Thank you very much.
Thanks.

882
01:04:30,584 --> 01:04:31,937
Merry Christmas.

883
01:04:44,784 --> 01:04:45,933
Come on.

884
01:04:50,224 --> 01:04:52,374
- What do you think?
- It's neat.

885
01:04:52,624 --> 01:04:54,854
- I told you.
- Where is everybody?

886
01:04:55,104 --> 01:04:59,541
Well, it's Saturday, so very few people
come in because it's a day off.

887
01:04:59,984 --> 01:05:01,542
Okay, push up.

888
01:05:04,824 --> 01:05:06,940
Push the top button.
Very top button.

889
01:05:07,184 --> 01:05:08,537
Go ahead, jump.

890
01:05:10,338 --> 01:05:11,538
Boy!

891
01:05:12,024 --> 01:05:13,173
- Look at that!
- Neat!

892
01:05:13,384 --> 01:05:14,783
You didn't know you were up this high.

893
01:05:15,024 --> 01:05:17,663
- What building is that?
- Which one?
- That has the pointy top to it.

894
01:05:17,904 --> 01:05:19,337
That's the Chrysler.

895
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:21,336
You proud of me?

896
01:05:21,337 --> 01:05:23,023
Yeah.
How'd you get this job?

897
01:05:23,024 --> 01:05:25,936
I told them I wanted it.
What's that say?

898
01:05:26,144 --> 01:05:27,133
It says Kramer.

899
01:05:27,384 --> 01:05:29,261
Kramer. Who's that?

900
01:05:29,504 --> 01:05:31,381
- That's us.
- That's right.

901
01:05:31,624 --> 01:05:32,943
- You want to see?
- Yeah.

902
01:05:34,624 --> 01:05:36,535
Wow!

903
01:05:37,704 --> 01:05:40,343
- This is neat.
- You like it?

904
01:05:40,344 --> 01:05:42,244
- Yeah.
- Careful, careful. Careful, careful.

905
01:05:42,304 --> 01:05:43,373
- I'm okay.
- You scare me.

906
01:05:43,624 --> 01:05:45,137
What's that building?

907
01:05:45,344 --> 01:05:47,983
That's the U.N. building.
And that's the East River right there.

908
01:05:48,224 --> 01:05:50,021
Look across there. You see that?

909
01:05:50,224 --> 01:05:52,784
That's Queens.
And look way, way down there.

910
01:05:53,024 --> 01:05:54,343
- You know what that is?
- What?

911
01:05:54,544 --> 01:05:57,183
- Brooklyn.
- Isn't that where you used to
live when you were a kid?

912
01:05:57,424 --> 01:06:00,143
That's right,
and this is where I work.

913
01:06:02,224 --> 01:06:04,135
- Is this really your desk?
- Yep.

914
01:06:05,736 --> 01:06:07,036
- Dad?
- Huh?

915
01:06:07,184 --> 01:06:08,936
Are you ever gonna get remarried?

916
01:06:09,144 --> 01:06:11,135
I don't know.
I hadn't thought about it.

917
01:06:11,624 --> 01:06:13,580
Are you ever gonna
be married to Phyllis?

918
01:06:13,784 --> 01:06:16,340
- No, we're just good friends.
- Oh.

919
01:06:19,384 --> 01:06:22,444
Are you and Mom ever
gonna get remarried?

920
01:06:22,824 --> 01:06:25,338
No, Mommy and me will never
be remarried.

921
01:06:25,824 --> 01:06:28,941
I bet if she saw this,
she'd remarry you.

922
01:06:31,064 --> 01:06:34,080
You know, you really are a con artist.
We made a deal. Right?

923
01:06:34,424 --> 01:06:36,380
The deal was that you
take a bath every night...

924
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:39,536
...and you wash that dirty, filthy
hair twice a week, right?

925
01:06:39,984 --> 01:06:40,780
- Right?
- Yeah.

926
01:06:41,024 --> 01:06:42,173
Okay.

927
01:06:42,424 --> 01:06:43,743
Now promise me, or
you're not going in there.

928
01:06:44,224 --> 01:06:46,784
Did I have to wash my hair twice a
week when Mommy was here?

929
01:06:47,024 --> 01:06:49,538
I don't care what you had
to do when Mommy...

930
01:06:51,304 --> 01:06:54,341
Did l, Dad? Did I?

931
01:06:56,384 --> 01:06:57,578
Daddy, are you listening to me?

932
01:06:57,824 --> 01:07:00,543
Okay, we'll talk about it tonight
when I get home, okay?

933
01:07:00,744 --> 01:07:02,336
Come here, give me a kiss.

934
01:07:03,304 --> 01:07:05,534
- Hey.
- What?
- You're a terrific kid.

935
01:07:11,584 --> 01:07:13,381
He says, "Look! There's the unicorn."

936
01:07:13,624 --> 01:07:16,184
And he goes underneath there,
uh-oh, and he says:

937
01:07:16,424 --> 01:07:18,540
"Crumbs, what's happening?

938
01:07:18,784 --> 01:07:20,342
The air supply has stopped.

939
01:07:20,584 --> 01:07:23,052
Thundering typhoons, what are you
two doing there instead of pumping?"

940
01:07:23,304 --> 01:07:25,534
"Us? We're resting. It's
tiring work, you know."

941
01:07:25,744 --> 01:07:27,177
Daddy, what's the air supply?

942
01:07:27,424 --> 01:07:30,734
Well, you know, when you got two tanks
on your back and you can't get any air...

943
01:07:30,944 --> 01:07:33,060
...you can drown, so you gotta
have that to breathe. Hello?

944
01:07:33,304 --> 01:07:34,498
Ted, John Shaunessy here.

945
01:07:34,704 --> 01:07:35,693
Hi, John. What's up?

946
01:07:35,904 --> 01:07:39,943
I just got a call from your wife's
lawyer. She wants to see the kid.

947
01:07:40,304 --> 01:07:42,534
- She wants what?
- She's the mother.

948
01:07:42,784 --> 01:07:44,775
That means she's
within her legal rights.

949
01:07:45,024 --> 01:07:49,063
- How do I know she's not going to kidnap him?
- Look, uh, Ted, I don't honestly
think she'd go to the trouble of...

950
01:07:49,304 --> 01:07:51,454
...suing for custody of the child
if she's going to kidnap him.

951
01:07:52,224 --> 01:07:54,977
All right, just wait a minute now. I'm
not so sure about her mental health.

952
01:07:55,224 --> 01:07:58,341
- What do you mean by that?
- She told me she was seeing a shrink.

953
01:07:58,544 --> 01:07:59,533
A psychiatrist or something.

954
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,137
Well did you see her talk to the walls?

955
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:02,857
No, but I'm just saying, you know.

956
01:08:03,104 --> 01:08:05,334
Look, I'm just saying that
you don't have a choice.

957
01:08:05,584 --> 01:08:08,815
Now have Billy at the boat pond
in Central Park, Saturday at 10.

958
01:08:09,064 --> 01:08:11,100
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

959
01:08:12,144 --> 01:08:13,543
Thanks very much.

960
01:08:14,744 --> 01:08:17,941
Daddy, will you come on
and finish the story?

961
01:08:19,024 --> 01:08:21,140
Okay, I'm coming. I'm coming.

962
01:08:24,744 --> 01:08:27,941
Daddy, what happens if the guy drowns?
How do they find him?

963
01:08:28,624 --> 01:08:31,821
I guess when you die, there's
bubbles that come up or something.

964
01:08:32,064 --> 01:08:33,258
Where did I leave off?

965
01:08:33,504 --> 01:08:35,938
You left off right there.

966
01:08:36,144 --> 01:08:37,702
"Thundering typhoons.
What are you two doing..."

967
01:08:40,304 --> 01:08:42,374
It's got an obstacle
course and stuff.

968
01:08:42,624 --> 01:08:44,740
- The cars go really fast.
- How much is it?

969
01:08:44,944 --> 01:08:46,013
- It's really neat.
- Billy!

970
01:08:46,224 --> 01:08:47,577
- It's neat.
- Billy!

971
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,943
- Come here, I want you to look...
- Okay, okay.

972
01:09:05,704 --> 01:09:07,934
I'll have him back by 6.

973
01:09:08,904 --> 01:09:10,178
You got so handsome.

974
01:10:04,344 --> 01:10:08,622
Remember, we talked about it, keep your
answers short, to the point, and succinct.

975
01:10:08,864 --> 01:10:12,140
Just tell the truth and you're going
to be all right. Believe me.

976
01:10:14,624 --> 01:10:17,092
- Did you see her.
- Yeah, I know. I saw her.

977
01:10:17,304 --> 01:10:20,979
Now, whatever you do, try not to become
emotional, no matter what the man says to you.

978
01:10:21,224 --> 01:10:24,660
Remember, you're going to hear a lot of things
that may upset you. I don't want you to react.

979
01:10:25,104 --> 01:10:29,063
O yay! O yay! Persons having business with
the Supreme Court, State of New York...

980
01:10:29,304 --> 01:10:32,535
...special term part five,
draw nigh and ye shall be heard.

981
01:10:32,784 --> 01:10:37,335
This court is now in session.
Judge Atkins presiding. All rise.

982
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:56,980
- Is the attorney for the petitioner ready?
- I am, Your Honor.

983
01:10:57,224 --> 01:10:59,260
For my first witness, I would
like to call Joanna Kramer.

984
01:10:59,504 --> 01:11:01,176
Motherhood. They're going
right for the throat.

985
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:04,222
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

986
01:11:04,464 --> 01:11:05,738
I do.

987
01:11:11,744 --> 01:11:15,783
Now then, Mrs. Kramer, would you tell
the court how long you were married?

988
01:11:16,024 --> 01:11:17,139
Eight years.

989
01:11:17,384 --> 01:11:20,535
And would you describe
those years as happy?

990
01:11:20,904 --> 01:11:22,895
The first two, yes.

991
01:11:23,224 --> 01:11:26,534
But after that it became
increasingly difficult.

992
01:11:27,424 --> 01:11:31,576
Mrs. Kramer, did you hold a job
before you were married?

993
01:11:31,824 --> 01:11:35,180
Yes, I did.
When I first got out of Smith...

994
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:40,259
...I worked in the art department of
Mademoiselle magazine for several years.

995
01:11:41,104 --> 01:11:44,540
Did you continue to work
after you were married?

996
01:11:44,744 --> 01:11:46,780
No. I did not.

997
01:11:47,024 --> 01:11:48,377
Did you wish to?

998
01:11:48,624 --> 01:11:53,334
Yes, but every time I talked to Ted...

999
01:11:53,544 --> 01:11:58,140
To my ex-husband about it,
he wouldn't listen.

1000
01:11:58,384 --> 01:12:02,741
He refused to discuss it
in any serious way.

1001
01:12:03,104 --> 01:12:05,538
I remember once he said that I
probably couldn't get a job...

1002
01:12:05,744 --> 01:12:08,258
...that would pay enough
to hire a babysitter for Billy.

1003
01:12:08,504 --> 01:12:11,337
Tell me, are you employed
at the present time?

1004
01:12:11,664 --> 01:12:13,973
Yes, I'm a sportswear designer
for Selco here in New York.

1005
01:12:14,224 --> 01:12:16,579
And what is your present salary?

1006
01:12:16,824 --> 01:12:19,338
I make $31,000 a year.

1007
01:12:19,744 --> 01:12:23,134
Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?

1008
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:26,339
Yes, I do, very much.

1009
01:12:26,624 --> 01:12:29,343
And yet you chose to leave him.

1010
01:12:30,224 --> 01:12:31,543
Yes.

1011
01:12:37,504 --> 01:12:40,940
Look. During the last five
years of our marriage...

1012
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:45,058
...I was becoming more
and more unhappy.

1013
01:12:45,704 --> 01:12:47,057
More and more troubled.

1014
01:12:47,304 --> 01:12:51,138
And I really needed
somebody to help me...

1015
01:12:51,384 --> 01:12:54,342
...but when I turned to Ted, he just...

1016
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:57,340
...wasn't there for me.

1017
01:12:57,944 --> 01:13:00,583
So we became more and more
isolated from one another...

1018
01:13:00,824 --> 01:13:02,542
...more and more separate.

1019
01:13:03,224 --> 01:13:05,738
He was very involved in his career.

1020
01:13:06,824 --> 01:13:10,783
And because of his attitude
towards my fears...

1021
01:13:11,024 --> 01:13:14,334
...and his inability
to deal with my feelings...

1022
01:13:15,504 --> 01:13:17,859
...I had come to have
almost no self-esteem.

1023
01:13:19,304 --> 01:13:21,898
I was scared and
I was very unhappy.

1024
01:13:22,104 --> 01:13:24,493
And in my mind I had no
other choice but to leave.

1025
01:13:26,304 --> 01:13:30,934
At the time I left, I felt that there was
something terribly wrong with me...

1026
01:13:31,424 --> 01:13:34,143
...and that my son would be
better off without me.

1027
01:13:35,824 --> 01:13:39,976
And it was only after I got
to California that I realized...

1028
01:13:40,224 --> 01:13:44,137
...after getting into therapy, that
I wasn't such a terrible person.

1029
01:13:46,784 --> 01:13:51,141
And just because I needed some kind
of creative or emotional outlet...

1030
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:54,456
...other than my child, that didn't
make me unfit to be a mother.

1031
01:13:55,344 --> 01:13:59,132
Your Honor, I would like to submit in evidence
a report by Mrs. Kramer's therapist...

1032
01:13:59,344 --> 01:14:00,823
...Dr. Eleanor Freedman.

1033
01:14:01,024 --> 01:14:02,139
Objection, Your Honor.

1034
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:05,740
The report is irrelevant and immaterial,
and not binding on the respondent.

1035
01:14:06,024 --> 01:14:07,013
Overruled.

1036
01:14:08,424 --> 01:14:11,939
Mrs. Kramer, can you tell the court
why you are asking for custody?

1037
01:14:13,704 --> 01:14:15,740
Because he's my child...

1038
01:14:16,184 --> 01:14:18,414
...and because I love him.

1039
01:14:19,904 --> 01:14:21,940
I know I left my son.

1040
01:14:23,224 --> 01:14:25,943
I know that that's
a terrible thing to do.

1041
01:14:29,304 --> 01:14:32,740
Believe me, I have to live with that
every day of my life.

1042
01:14:33,224 --> 01:14:35,340
But in order to leave him...

1043
01:14:35,984 --> 01:14:39,135
...I had to believe that it was
the only thing I could do...

1044
01:14:40,984 --> 01:14:43,179
...and that it was
the best thing for him.

1045
01:14:43,424 --> 01:14:45,984
I was incapable of
functioning in that home.

1046
01:14:46,224 --> 01:14:48,135
And I didn't know...

1047
01:14:48,344 --> 01:14:50,539
...what the alternative
was going to be...

1048
01:14:50,744 --> 01:14:53,861
...so I thought it was not best
that I take him with me.

1049
01:14:54,104 --> 01:14:57,540
However, I have since
gotten some help...

1050
01:14:57,824 --> 01:15:02,136
...and I have worked very, very hard
to become a whole human being.

1051
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:07,344
And I don't think I should be
punished for that.

1052
01:15:08,944 --> 01:15:11,742
And I don't think my little boy
should be punished.

1053
01:15:12,184 --> 01:15:14,334
Billy's only 7 years old.

1054
01:15:15,224 --> 01:15:16,737
He needs me.

1055
01:15:17,624 --> 01:15:20,343
I'm not saying he doesn't
need his father...

1056
01:15:21,544 --> 01:15:24,138
...but I really believe
he needs me more.

1057
01:15:25,944 --> 01:15:30,142
I was his mommy
for five and a half years...

1058
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:34,937
...and Ted took over that role
for 18 months.

1059
01:15:39,104 --> 01:15:41,857
But I don't know how anybody
can possibly believe...

1060
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:45,983
...that I have less of a stake
in mothering that little boy...

1061
01:15:46,224 --> 01:15:48,340
...than Mr. Kramer does.

1062
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:53,142
I'm his mother.

1063
01:15:55,504 --> 01:15:57,142
I'm his mother.

1064
01:16:02,304 --> 01:16:03,339
Thank you, Mrs. Kramer.

1065
01:16:03,744 --> 01:16:05,735
I have no further questions.

1066
01:16:07,744 --> 01:16:10,133
Now then, Mrs. Kramer...

1067
01:16:10,944 --> 01:16:15,335
...you say that you were married
for eight years, is that correct?

1068
01:16:16,336 --> 01:16:17,336
Yes.

1069
01:16:17,384 --> 01:16:22,299
In all that time did your husband ever strike
you or physically abuse you in any way?

1070
01:16:23,424 --> 01:16:24,618
No.

1071
01:16:24,824 --> 01:16:29,534
Did he ever strike or physically
abuse his child in any way?

1072
01:16:29,535 --> 01:16:30,535
No.

1073
01:16:30,984 --> 01:16:33,942
Would you describe your
husband as an alcoholic?

1074
01:16:34,243 --> 01:16:35,243
No.

1075
01:16:35,304 --> 01:16:36,737
A heavy drinker?

1076
01:16:36,738 --> 01:16:37,623
No.

1077
01:16:37,624 --> 01:16:39,342
Was he unfaithful?

1078
01:16:44,343 --> 01:16:45,343
No.

1079
01:16:46,424 --> 01:16:49,336
Did he ever fail to provide
for you in any way?

1080
01:16:49,337 --> 01:16:50,337
No.

1081
01:16:51,744 --> 01:16:54,099
Well, I can certainly see
why you left him.

1082
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:55,743
Objection.

1083
01:16:57,904 --> 01:17:00,737
How long do you plan to live
in New York, Mrs. Kramer?

1084
01:17:01,144 --> 01:17:02,543
Permanently.

1085
01:17:04,224 --> 01:17:07,022
How many boyfriends have
you had, permanently?

1086
01:17:07,264 --> 01:17:09,380
Objection, Your Honor, on the
grounds of vagueness.

1087
01:17:09,624 --> 01:17:10,943
I'll allow it.

1088
01:17:14,904 --> 01:17:15,939
I don't recall.

1089
01:17:16,344 --> 01:17:18,733
Well, more than three,
less than 33, permanently?

1090
01:17:18,984 --> 01:17:20,212
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1091
01:17:20,464 --> 01:17:22,534
The witness will answer, please.

1092
01:17:24,584 --> 01:17:26,176
Somewhere in between.

1093
01:17:26,424 --> 01:17:27,937
Do you have a lover now?

1094
01:17:31,784 --> 01:17:35,379
Your Honor, I would request a direct
answer to a direct question.

1095
01:17:35,624 --> 01:17:37,342
Does she have a lover?

1096
01:17:37,584 --> 01:17:41,133
I'll allow that.
The witness will answer, please.

1097
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,940
Yes, I'm seeing someone now.

1098
01:17:45,184 --> 01:17:47,823
Is that... permanent?

1099
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:50,579
Well, I don't know.

1100
01:17:50,824 --> 01:17:53,258
We don't really know, do we,
when you say permanently...

1101
01:17:53,504 --> 01:17:57,577
...if you plan to live in New York, or even
to keep your child, for that matter...

1102
01:17:57,824 --> 01:18:02,420
...since you've never really done anything
in your life that was continuing, stable,
or that could be regarded as permanent.

1103
01:18:02,624 --> 01:18:06,822
Objection. I must request the counsel be
prevented from harassing the witness.

1104
01:18:07,064 --> 01:18:08,179
Sustained.

1105
01:18:08,424 --> 01:18:10,733
I'll put it another way, Counselor.

1106
01:18:11,304 --> 01:18:14,853
What was the longest personal
relationship in your life...

1107
01:18:15,064 --> 01:18:17,532
...outside of your parents
or girlfriends?

1108
01:18:19,904 --> 01:18:21,542
I suppose that would be with my child.

1109
01:18:22,184 --> 01:18:24,744
Whom you've seen twice in a year.

1110
01:18:24,944 --> 01:18:28,539
Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband...

1111
01:18:28,784 --> 01:18:32,333
...wasn't he the longest
personal relationship in your life?

1112
01:18:35,744 --> 01:18:37,939
Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer?
I couldn't hear you.

1113
01:18:38,944 --> 01:18:40,138
Yes.

1114
01:18:40,624 --> 01:18:42,137
How long was that?

1115
01:18:43,624 --> 01:18:46,741
We were married a year
before the baby...

1116
01:18:47,424 --> 01:18:48,857
...and then seven years after that.

1117
01:18:49,104 --> 01:18:52,733
So, you were a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life.

1118
01:18:52,944 --> 01:18:54,502
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1119
01:18:54,744 --> 01:18:57,542
The witness's opinion on this
is relevant.

1120
01:18:58,384 --> 01:19:00,136
I was not a failure.

1121
01:19:00,784 --> 01:19:04,094
Oh? What do you call it then, a success?
The marriage ended in divorce.

1122
01:19:04,584 --> 01:19:06,939
I consider it less my failure
than his.

1123
01:19:07,144 --> 01:19:08,577
Congratulations, Mrs. Kramer.

1124
01:19:08,824 --> 01:19:12,499
You've just rewritten matrimonial law.
You were both divorced.

1125
01:19:12,744 --> 01:19:14,143
Objection!

1126
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:18,340
Your Honor, I would like to ask
what this model of stability...

1127
01:19:18,584 --> 01:19:20,779
...and respectability
has ever succeeded at.

1128
01:19:21,344 --> 01:19:26,020
Were you a failure at the one most
important personal relationship in your life?

1129
01:19:28,144 --> 01:19:33,059
- It did not succeed.
- Not it, Mrs. Kramer, you.

1130
01:19:33,304 --> 01:19:37,661
Were you a failure at the one most
important relationship in your life?

1131
01:19:37,904 --> 01:19:39,337
Were you?!

1132
01:19:44,744 --> 01:19:45,938
No.

1133
01:19:51,104 --> 01:19:52,856
Is that a yes, Mrs. Kramer?

1134
01:20:00,024 --> 01:20:01,742
No further questions.

1135
01:20:05,544 --> 01:20:08,422
- Did you have to be so rough on her?
- You want the kid or don't you?

1136
01:20:08,704 --> 01:20:09,898
Daddy?

1137
01:20:10,784 --> 01:20:11,978
Daddy.

1138
01:20:12,304 --> 01:20:15,137
- Yeah?
- What did you do when you were little?

1139
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:16,697
I guess about the same things you do.

1140
01:20:16,984 --> 01:20:19,293
Did you watch The Brady Bunch?

1141
01:20:19,864 --> 01:20:22,298
No, we didn't have any television.

1142
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,297
You didn't?

1143
01:20:24,544 --> 01:20:26,216
Uh-uh. We listened to the radio, mostly.

1144
01:20:26,424 --> 01:20:27,823
What else didn't you have
when you were little?

1145
01:20:28,264 --> 01:20:29,936
We didn't have lots of things.

1146
01:20:30,144 --> 01:20:32,100
- Like?
- Like a lot of things.

1147
01:20:33,144 --> 01:20:34,133
What kind?

1148
01:20:37,104 --> 01:20:38,503
Come here.

1149
01:20:39,624 --> 01:20:41,137
We didn't have diet soda.

1150
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:43,500
We had egg creams, which was a
little bit of chocolate syrup...

1151
01:20:43,744 --> 01:20:46,099
...and a little bit of seltzer water,
and a bit of milk, and you went...

1152
01:20:46,464 --> 01:20:49,183
...all squished up, and you drank it,
and it was delicious.

1153
01:20:49,384 --> 01:20:51,773
We didn't have the Mets,
but we had the Brooklyn Dodgers.

1154
01:20:51,984 --> 01:20:54,817
And we had the Polo Grounds
and we had Ebbets Field...

1155
01:20:55,024 --> 01:20:56,901
Oh, boy, those were the days.

1156
01:20:57,104 --> 01:20:59,095
And we didn't have the Volkswagens...

1157
01:20:59,304 --> 01:21:02,774
...but we had all those different kind
of cars with funny names on them.

1158
01:21:02,984 --> 01:21:05,293
We didn't have any Burger
King's or McDonald's.

1159
01:21:05,544 --> 01:21:09,696
We had automats where you went
inside put a quarter in and you'd get...

1160
01:21:09,984 --> 01:21:13,294
...a piece of pie or a sandwich that
you could see through a window.

1161
01:21:13,504 --> 01:21:16,337
We didn't have graffiti, but we had this
guy Kilroy, and he went down the street...

1162
01:21:16,984 --> 01:21:19,134
Mr. Kramer is a very devoted father.

1163
01:21:19,384 --> 01:21:22,057
He spends a great deal of time
with Billy.

1164
01:21:22,664 --> 01:21:24,177
He reads to Billy a lot.

1165
01:21:24,384 --> 01:21:27,899
They play together,
they talk all the time.

1166
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:30,342
He's a wonderful father.

1167
01:21:30,544 --> 01:21:33,297
Thank you, Mrs. Phelps.
No further questions.

1168
01:21:33,544 --> 01:21:36,502
Mrs. Phelps, how long
have you known Joanna Kramer?

1169
01:21:36,904 --> 01:21:40,658
About six years, ever since she and
Ted moved into the building.

1170
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:44,300
And how often did you see
Joanna Kramer and her son?

1171
01:21:44,784 --> 01:21:48,857
Well, of course I haven't seen them together
now for about a year and a half, but...

1172
01:21:49,064 --> 01:21:52,101
...back then I saw them maybe
two or three times a week.

1173
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:54,898
Kim, my oldest daughter, and
Billy play together all the time.

1174
01:21:55,104 --> 01:21:59,097
Can you describe the relationship
between Joanna Kramer and her son?

1175
01:21:59,304 --> 01:22:00,100
It was good.

1176
01:22:00,744 --> 01:22:02,382
Joanna was a very good mother.

1177
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,575
Both Ted and Joanna are very...

1178
01:22:04,784 --> 01:22:07,901
In the time you knew Joanna Kramer,
did Mrs. Kramer discuss her relationship
with her ex-husband?

1179
01:22:08,584 --> 01:22:09,903
Yes.

1180
01:22:10,144 --> 01:22:12,897
Can you tell the court
exactly what she said?

1181
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:16,700
Joanna wasn't very happy
for a number of reasons...

1182
01:22:16,944 --> 01:22:21,301
Did you ever hear her say Mr. Kramer
was insensitive to his son's needs?

1183
01:22:25,144 --> 01:22:27,499
Mrs. Phelps, would you
answer the question?

1184
01:22:28,504 --> 01:22:30,938
- I'm sorry, but I didn't hear you.
- Yes, but that was before...

1185
01:22:31,224 --> 01:22:33,738
Did you ever encourage Joanna Kramer
to her to leave her husband?

1186
01:22:34,184 --> 01:22:35,458
No, I did not.

1187
01:22:38,144 --> 01:22:41,500
Several days before she left,
did you say to her:

1188
01:22:41,744 --> 01:22:45,703
"If you are in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1189
01:22:47,344 --> 01:22:50,063
- I didn't think that Joanna...
- Did you say to her:

1190
01:22:50,264 --> 01:22:53,461
" If you're in this much pain,
you owe it to yourself to leave"?

1191
01:22:54,744 --> 01:22:57,781
- Yes, but she was my friend...
- Thank you, Mrs. Phelps,
no further questions.

1192
01:22:59,104 --> 01:23:01,140
Mrs. Phelps, you may step down.

1193
01:23:01,344 --> 01:23:03,858
Joanna, things are not the same now.

1194
01:23:04,264 --> 01:23:05,617
Ted is not the same man.

1195
01:23:05,864 --> 01:23:08,537
- You don't know how hard he's tried...
- Mrs. Phelps!

1196
01:23:08,744 --> 01:23:10,496
- They're beautiful together.
- Mrs. Phelps!

1197
01:23:10,784 --> 01:23:12,536
Your Honor, the witness has
been asked to step down.

1198
01:23:12,744 --> 01:23:14,541
If you could see them
together, Joanna...

1199
01:23:14,744 --> 01:23:16,575
...I mean maybe you
wouldn't be here now.

1200
01:23:16,784 --> 01:23:18,695
Mrs. Phelps, that will be all!

1201
01:23:24,144 --> 01:23:25,497
I'm sorry.

1202
01:23:27,904 --> 01:23:29,178
You know, when you were talking...

1203
01:23:29,944 --> 01:23:34,495
I mean my wife, I mean my ex-wife,
when she was talking about how unhappy
she was during our marriage...

1204
01:23:34,704 --> 01:23:37,218
...I guess most of what she said
was probably true.

1205
01:23:37,424 --> 01:23:39,699
There's a lot of things
I didn't understand.

1206
01:23:40,344 --> 01:23:42,904
There's a lot of things I'd
do different if I could...

1207
01:23:43,264 --> 01:23:46,256
...just like I think there's a lot of things
you wish you could change but can't.

1208
01:23:46,464 --> 01:23:49,695
Some things, once they're done,
can't be undone.

1209
01:23:50,784 --> 01:23:52,342
My wife...

1210
01:23:52,664 --> 01:23:57,294
My ex-wife says that she loves
Billy and I believe she does.

1211
01:23:58,104 --> 01:24:00,493
But I don't think
that's the issue here.

1212
01:24:01,504 --> 01:24:03,495
If I understand it correctly...

1213
01:24:04,384 --> 01:24:07,933
...what means the most here is
what's best for our son.

1214
01:24:08,424 --> 01:24:10,699
What's best for Billy.

1215
01:24:11,744 --> 01:24:13,541
My wife used to always say to me:

1216
01:24:13,744 --> 01:24:16,861
"Why can't a woman have
the same ambitions as a man?"

1217
01:24:17,384 --> 01:24:18,897
I think you're right.

1218
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:21,300
And maybe I've learned that much.

1219
01:24:21,504 --> 01:24:23,813
But, by the same token,
I'd like to know...

1220
01:24:24,064 --> 01:24:28,819
...what law is it that says a woman is a
better parent simply by virtue of her sex?

1221
01:24:29,584 --> 01:24:32,621
You know, I've had time to think about what
is it that makes somebody a good parent.

1222
01:24:32,904 --> 01:24:35,657
It has to do with constancy.
It has to do with patience...

1223
01:24:35,864 --> 01:24:37,297
...it has to do with listening to him...

1224
01:24:37,544 --> 01:24:40,138
...or it has to do with pretending to
listen when you can't even listen anymore.

1225
01:24:40,384 --> 01:24:43,501
It has to do with love,
like she was saying.

1226
01:24:43,824 --> 01:24:47,533
And I don't know where it's written
that says that a woman has
a corner on that market...

1227
01:24:47,784 --> 01:24:50,901
...that a man has any less of those
emotions than a woman does.

1228
01:24:51,144 --> 01:24:54,295
Billy has a home with me.
I've made it the best I could.

1229
01:24:54,544 --> 01:24:57,217
It's not perfect.
I'm not a perfect parent.

1230
01:24:57,464 --> 01:25:02,254
Sometimes I don't have enough patience
and I forget that he's a little kid.

1231
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:03,983
But I'm there.

1232
01:25:05,584 --> 01:25:09,577
We get up in the morning and we
eat breakfast and he talks to me,
and then we go to school.

1233
01:25:09,824 --> 01:25:13,942
And at night we have dinner together and,
and we talk then, and I read to him and...

1234
01:25:15,184 --> 01:25:18,699
And we built a life together
and we love each other.

1235
01:25:25,424 --> 01:25:27,301
If you destroy that...

1236
01:25:28,824 --> 01:25:31,099
...it may be irreparable.

1237
01:25:38,664 --> 01:25:41,497
Joanna, don't do that, please.

1238
01:25:43,184 --> 01:25:46,301
- Don't do it twice to him.
- Thank you, Mr. Kramer.

1239
01:25:46,544 --> 01:25:48,102
No further questions.

1240
01:25:49,864 --> 01:25:52,139
Mr. Kramer, how long have you
worked in advertising?

1241
01:25:52,344 --> 01:25:54,494
Ever since I graduated high school.

1242
01:25:55,784 --> 01:25:58,935
College, I mean. I started in the mail
room been there about 10 or 15 years.

1243
01:25:59,184 --> 01:26:03,018
And would you say that you've achieved a
certain status or position in your profession?

1244
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:05,215
Yes, I think I have a
pretty good reputation.

1245
01:26:05,464 --> 01:26:08,934
Mr. Kramer, when you were working at Roth,
Kane and Donovan, what was your salary?

1246
01:26:09,144 --> 01:26:11,180
I made around $33,000
a year when I left.

1247
01:26:11,384 --> 01:26:13,944
And now I believe you're working
at Norman, Craig and Kummel?

1248
01:26:14,144 --> 01:26:16,055
- Yes.
- And what is your salary there?

1249
01:26:16,584 --> 01:26:18,734
It's almost 29,000.

1250
01:26:18,944 --> 01:26:21,253
Could you be more specific, Mr. Kramer?

1251
01:26:21,624 --> 01:26:23,740
I make $28,200.

1252
01:26:24,144 --> 01:26:26,055
28,200.

1253
01:26:26,664 --> 01:26:30,896
Well, Mr. Kramer, you're the only
person I've heard of who's working his way
down the ladder of success.

1254
01:26:31,104 --> 01:26:35,461
Objection. Your Honor, I must ask that
counsel's last remark be stricken from the record.

1255
01:26:35,744 --> 01:26:36,620
Sustained.

1256
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:39,338
Now, Mr. Kramer, isn't it true you that
were fired from your previous job?

1257
01:26:39,584 --> 01:26:44,021
- I was let go.
- Very well, Mr. Kramer. Will you tell
the court why you were let go?

1258
01:26:44,464 --> 01:26:46,614
There was a difference
of opinion in company policy.

1259
01:26:46,904 --> 01:26:51,295
Mr. Kramer, isn't it true that your
agency lost a major advertising
account due to your negligence?

1260
01:26:51,744 --> 01:26:52,540
Objection!

1261
01:26:52,744 --> 01:26:55,417
Your Honor, I'm simply trying to establish
the witness's employment record.

1262
01:26:55,664 --> 01:26:57,894
He pretends to fitness,
but he cannot hold a job.

1263
01:26:58,144 --> 01:26:59,657
I'll allow it, Mr. Shaunessy.

1264
01:27:00,704 --> 01:27:03,741
It's not unusual in advertising for a
client, in the middle of a campaign...

1265
01:27:03,984 --> 01:27:06,100
...to change his mind and go elsewhere.
It happens every day.

1266
01:27:06,944 --> 01:27:10,414
Mr. Kramer, was it not true that
you walked out on a client during
a major presentation...

1267
01:27:10,784 --> 01:27:13,696
...saying that you had an appointment
with a first grade teacher?

1268
01:27:13,944 --> 01:27:16,902
There was a problem in school.
My son was sitting next to a
kid who was hitting and biting.

1269
01:27:17,144 --> 01:27:19,704
- Yes or no?
- Yes, but he bit my kid.

1270
01:27:19,984 --> 01:27:23,943
Mr. Kramer, in spring of this last year,
did you or did you not, miss a deadline
on the Mid-Atlantic airlines account...

1271
01:27:24,144 --> 01:27:26,612
...causing your company, not only
a great deal of embarrassment...

1272
01:27:26,824 --> 01:27:28,735
...but considerable
financial liability as well?

1273
01:27:28,944 --> 01:27:31,583
On that day I had to go home
because my child was sick.

1274
01:27:31,824 --> 01:27:34,292
Did you or did you not
miss a deadline? Yes or no.

1275
01:27:34,544 --> 01:27:36,535
- My son was sick.
- Mr. Kramer, answer the question.

1276
01:27:36,824 --> 01:27:39,896
I'm trying to answer the question.
It's not yes or no. I'm sitting there...

1277
01:27:40,784 --> 01:27:42,934
- Mr. Kramer, yes or no?
- He had a 104 temperature!

1278
01:27:43,144 --> 01:27:45,612
He's lying there sweating!
I go home to be with him!

1279
01:27:46,184 --> 01:27:50,496
Mr. Kramer, I must urge you to stop
or I'll have to hold you in contempt.

1280
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:57,862
I missed the deadline.

1281
01:27:58,664 --> 01:28:01,383
- Mr. Kramer, would you say
you have a violent temper?
- No.

1282
01:28:01,624 --> 01:28:03,455
- Objection.
- I'll withdraw the question.

1283
01:28:03,704 --> 01:28:06,582
- Mr. Kramer, do you consider yourself
a fit and responsible parent?
- Yes, I do.

1284
01:28:06,864 --> 01:28:09,697
And isn't it true that your child nearly lost
an eye when he was in your care?

1285
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:11,497
- Objection.
- Overruled.

1286
01:28:11,704 --> 01:28:13,103
Answer the question, Mr. Kramer.

1287
01:28:13,384 --> 01:28:15,500
We were in the playground,
and he was on the jungle gym with...

1288
01:28:15,784 --> 01:28:18,617
And fell and nearly lost an eye
when he was in your care.

1289
01:28:18,824 --> 01:28:20,098
He fell down and cut himself.

1290
01:28:20,304 --> 01:28:21,862
Isn't it true that you
told your ex-wife...

1291
01:28:22,064 --> 01:28:25,579
...you were responsible for the injury
that permanently disfigured your child?

1292
01:28:25,904 --> 01:28:27,053
- I object. That the counsel for the petitioner...
- Did you say to her:

1293
01:28:27,504 --> 01:28:30,701
"When it happened I felt I was guilty.
I felt it was my fault"?

1294
01:28:30,944 --> 01:28:33,822
- Objection!
- Your Honor, I have concluded my questions.

1295
01:29:08,224 --> 01:29:09,213
Ted?

1296
01:29:10,744 --> 01:29:12,097
Ted?

1297
01:29:16,904 --> 01:29:21,739
I'm sorry. I mentioned the accident
to him two months ago, and
after I saw you with Phyllis...

1298
01:29:21,944 --> 01:29:24,902
...and I never thought he would
bring it up. Never.

1299
01:29:26,384 --> 01:29:27,703
Believe me.

1300
01:29:28,544 --> 01:29:32,696
I never would have mentioned it if
I thought he'd pull a thing like that.

1301
01:29:33,704 --> 01:29:34,898
I'm sorry.

1302
01:29:35,304 --> 01:29:36,498
I'm...

1303
01:29:47,544 --> 01:29:48,499
Ted.

1304
01:29:48,784 --> 01:29:50,740
- Hi.
- Hi. Here, let me help you.

1305
01:29:50,944 --> 01:29:52,138
Heard anything yet?

1306
01:29:52,344 --> 01:29:55,142
Any day. My lawyer says
no news is good news.

1307
01:29:55,384 --> 01:29:56,942
- Guess what.
- What?

1308
01:29:57,184 --> 01:29:59,652
Charley and I are talking about
getting back together again.

1309
01:29:59,864 --> 01:30:02,424
Really?
Did he finally call you?

1310
01:30:02,664 --> 01:30:04,143
No, I called him.

1311
01:30:04,384 --> 01:30:05,499
How come?

1312
01:30:05,744 --> 01:30:09,737
I don't know. I got to thinking about
a lot of things since the trial, you know.

1313
01:30:09,984 --> 01:30:10,939
And...

1314
01:30:11,664 --> 01:30:14,303
Anyway, I don't think it'll work out,
but he seems to want it.

1315
01:30:14,544 --> 01:30:17,695
That's terrific.
How do you feel?

1316
01:30:17,904 --> 01:30:21,294
I don't know.
I feel scared, I guess.

1317
01:30:31,144 --> 01:30:32,975
- Hi.
- Hi.

1318
01:30:35,384 --> 01:30:36,578
I lost.

1319
01:30:37,904 --> 01:30:40,099
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

1320
01:30:48,664 --> 01:30:49,892
What happened?

1321
01:30:51,184 --> 01:30:54,335
The judge went for motherhood
right down the line.

1322
01:30:55,344 --> 01:30:59,337
"Ordered adjudged and decreed that the
petitioner be awarded custody...

1323
01:30:59,584 --> 01:31:01,779
...of the minor child effective Monday,
the 23rd of January...

1324
01:31:02,144 --> 01:31:06,820
...that the respondent pay for the maintenance
and support of said child, $400 each month.

1325
01:31:07,064 --> 01:31:09,498
That the father shall have the
following rights of visitation:

1326
01:31:09,784 --> 01:31:13,333
Every other weekend, one night each
week to be mutually agreed upon...

1327
01:31:13,584 --> 01:31:16,303
...and one half of the child's
vacation period."

1328
01:31:16,544 --> 01:31:18,694
- That's it.
- What if I fight it?

1329
01:31:18,904 --> 01:31:20,701
We can appeal, but I
can't guarantee anything.

1330
01:31:20,904 --> 01:31:22,223
I'll take my chances.

1331
01:31:22,464 --> 01:31:24,694
- It'll cost you.
- I don't care. I'll pay anything.

1332
01:31:25,384 --> 01:31:27,898
Look, Ted, I'm going to have
to tell you something.

1333
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:31,778
This time it'll be Billy that pays.

1334
01:31:31,984 --> 01:31:34,020
I'll have to put him on the stand.

1335
01:31:34,464 --> 01:31:36,102
I can't do that.

1336
01:31:36,384 --> 01:31:38,295
No, I don't want to do that.

1337
01:31:40,944 --> 01:31:43,617
Thanks very much for your time.
I'm gonna take a walk.

1338
01:31:59,304 --> 01:32:01,693
Ted? It's me.

1339
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:07,899
Ted?

1340
01:32:08,424 --> 01:32:09,903
I just heard.

1341
01:32:10,304 --> 01:32:11,896
Please go away.

1342
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:14,895
Are you okay?

1343
01:32:16,384 --> 01:32:19,899
I just have to be by myself
for a while, Margaret.

1344
01:32:27,224 --> 01:32:28,259
I don't understand.

1345
01:32:28,504 --> 01:32:31,337
Well the problem is that your mommy and
I both want you to live with us, see.

1346
01:32:31,544 --> 01:32:35,742
So that's why we decided to go see
this man, who I told you is the judge...

1347
01:32:35,944 --> 01:32:39,220
...and we let him decide because he's very
wise and experienced about these things.

1348
01:32:39,424 --> 01:32:42,939
See we talked to him for a few days
and after that we asked him what he thought.

1349
01:32:43,184 --> 01:32:45,379
You know what he said?
He agreed with Mommy.

1350
01:32:45,584 --> 01:32:49,020
He thought it'd be terrific if you move
in with her lived there from now on.

1351
01:32:49,264 --> 01:32:52,574
And I'm really lucky because I get
to have dinner with you once a week.

1352
01:32:52,824 --> 01:32:55,702
And two times a month we spend
the weekends together.

1353
01:32:57,184 --> 01:33:00,301
Where's my bed gonna be?
Where am I gonna sleep?

1354
01:33:00,664 --> 01:33:04,543
Oh, Mommy's figured that all out. You
have your own bedroom at her place.

1355
01:33:05,984 --> 01:33:08,373
- Where will all my toys going to be?
- At Mommy's.

1356
01:33:08,584 --> 01:33:10,734
We're gonna take
all your toys over there.

1357
01:33:10,944 --> 01:33:13,902
If you play your cards right, I'll bet
you she'll buy you some new ones.

1358
01:33:14,984 --> 01:33:17,179
Who's gonna read me
my bedtime stories?

1359
01:33:17,584 --> 01:33:19,097
Mommy will.

1360
01:33:19,784 --> 01:33:22,139
You're not gonna kiss me good
night anymore are you dad?

1361
01:33:22,384 --> 01:33:24,579
No, I won't be able to do that.

1362
01:33:24,784 --> 01:33:28,094
But, you know, I get to visit.

1363
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,972
It's gonna be okay. Really.

1364
01:33:33,184 --> 01:33:35,539
If I don't like it, can I come home?

1365
01:33:35,784 --> 01:33:37,297
What do you mean,
if you don't like it?

1366
01:33:37,504 --> 01:33:39,620
You're going to have a
great time with Mommy.

1367
01:33:39,824 --> 01:33:42,099
Really. She loves you so much.

1368
01:33:42,584 --> 01:33:43,903
- Dad?
- Huh?

1369
01:33:44,904 --> 01:33:48,294
Don't forget, once, if you can
just call me up, okay?

1370
01:33:54,504 --> 01:33:56,301
We're gonna be okay.

1371
01:34:00,944 --> 01:34:02,980
Come one, let's go get some ice cream.

1372
01:35:38,544 --> 01:35:41,297
Okay, come on, let's get
this show on the road, huh?

1373
01:35:43,264 --> 01:35:45,141
Let's get a little hustle
around here, okay?

1374
01:35:45,344 --> 01:35:47,062
Come on, set the table.

1375
01:35:55,384 --> 01:35:56,499
Come on.

1376
01:36:07,744 --> 01:36:09,097
Are you ready?

1377
01:36:26,784 --> 01:36:27,580
Yes?

1378
01:36:27,824 --> 01:36:30,292
Ted, it's Joanna.
I'm downstairs in the lobby.

1379
01:36:30,504 --> 01:36:32,893
Can you come down here
and meet me? Alone.

1380
01:36:39,664 --> 01:36:40,619
Hi.

1381
01:36:41,944 --> 01:36:43,093
What's up?

1382
01:36:47,344 --> 01:36:49,494
Tell me. What?
What's the matter?

1383
01:36:50,184 --> 01:36:52,095
I woke up this morning.

1384
01:36:55,864 --> 01:36:57,695
I kept thinking about Billy...

1385
01:36:57,944 --> 01:37:00,777
...and I was thinking about
him waking up in his room...

1386
01:37:00,984 --> 01:37:03,657
...with his little clouds
all around that I painted...

1387
01:37:03,904 --> 01:37:08,455
...and I thought I should have
painted clouds downtown because...

1388
01:37:10,064 --> 01:37:13,500
...then he would think that
he was waking up at home.

1389
01:37:16,624 --> 01:37:19,696
I came here to take my son home.

1390
01:37:23,784 --> 01:37:26,093
And I realized he already is home.

1391
01:37:32,224 --> 01:37:34,499
I love him very much.

1392
01:37:39,704 --> 01:37:41,899
I'm not gonna take him with me.

1393
01:37:50,424 --> 01:37:53,222
Can I go up and talk to him?

1394
01:37:53,504 --> 01:37:54,619
Yeah.

1395
01:38:02,384 --> 01:38:05,694
Listen. Why don't you go upstairs
and see him and I'll wait here.

1396
01:38:16,584 --> 01:38:18,097
How do I look?

1397
01:38:20,144 --> 01:38:21,099
You look terrific.
