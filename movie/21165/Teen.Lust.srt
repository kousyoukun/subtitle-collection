You're supposed to try to get in her pants, you know,

not convert her.        

76
00:03:14,249 --> 00:03:15,915
我清楚，故意搞砸的

He put a card in my girlfriends bra,

it is time to ask ourselves why do we worship Satan?     

123
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:32,855

00:05:50,938 --> 00:05:57,241
縱欲的自由
in the pleasures of Earth,Heaven and Hell.         

129
00:05:57,243 --> 00:05:59,243
耶穌基督
Jesus Christ.          

130
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:00,711
褻瀆神明啊！
Blasphemy!            

131
00:06:00,713 --> 00:06:06,148
大家可以別分心嗎？
If we could have everybody's undivided attention?       

132
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:09,217
感謝
Thank you.           

133
00:06:09,219 --> 00:06:10,318
掉鏈子了
Where was I.          

134
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:11,319
說到“真理選邊站”
Side of truth.         

135
00:06:11,321 --> 00:06:13,988
對，兄弟姐妹們
Oh yes, brothers and sisters  

136
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,825
崇拜撒旦王這玩意
the worship of Satan is all of these things.      

137
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:23,429
其核心無非圍繞 “真理選邊站”
But most of all it is to be on the side of the truth.     

138
00:06:23,431 --> 00:06:34,004
為了上帝，讓不潔流出你的雙眼
是欺世盜名，撒旦才是救世主
Let the scales fall from your eyes for God is 
the deceiver and Satan is the salvation.              

139
00:06:34,006 --> 00:06:38,774
很快我們就會進行阿司塔羅斯王慶典
Soon we will perform the celebration of Astaroth,     

140
00:06:38,776 --> 00:06:42,477
Neil小弟會完全奉獻自己來挫敗
our young brother Neil will give himself over completely      

141
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,083
天堂強加給撒旦大王的罪名
to our Lord to foil the accursed forces of Heaven.         

142
00:06:49,085 --> 00:06:50,818
撒旦王萬歲！
Hail Satan!           

143
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,453
撒旦王萬歲！
Hail Satan!

144
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:56,088
呈上祭品
Bring forth the offering.    

145
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:59,357

146
00:06:59,359 --> 00:07:02,326
啊，是只山羊呢
Aw, look at the goat.      

147
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:07,363
主，小小心意，不成敬意
Lord, please accept this humble sacrifice.      

148
00:07:07,365 --> 00:07:10,332
我真想代它去死
I would totally trade places with that goat right now.     

149
00:07:10,334 --> 00:07:11,533
作為信仰的標誌
As a token of our faith.    

150
00:07:11,535 --> 00:07:13,601
做看官就好
Just keep watching.       

151
00:07:13,603 --> 00:07:16,270
撒旦王在上！
In Nomina Satanas!       

152
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:22,608
記住，週三本會有餅賣
And remember, this Wednesday we're having a bake sale

153
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:26,811
善款全數作為保齡球隊和
to raise money for our bowling team and also the star      

154
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,248
阿司塔羅斯節慶典的香油錢
of our upcoming celebration of Astaroth ceremony,       

155
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:32,984
Neil因此很努力準備
Neil, is working so hard to prepare.        

156
00:07:32,986 --> 00:07:35,286
我們以示支持一下
Lets show him our support.   

157
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,887

158
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:38,755
沒錯
Oh yeah.            

159
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:41,891
沒錯
Oh yeah.            

160
00:07:41,893 --> 00:07:45,427
剛才儀式說話這事
Hey, so this talking during church thing.       

161
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,995
很過癮，對嗎？
Pretty fun, is it?       

162
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:48,997
娘，爹，聽我解釋
Mom, Dad, listen.        

163
00:07:48,999 --> 00:07:50,164
不必了
No, no, no, no, no.       

164
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,499
你那不嚴肅和哄笑
I can actually see how joking and laughing           

165
00:07:52,501 --> 00:07:54,801
正正讓我家出醜
and embarrassing your family you know instead of        

166
00:07:54,803 --> 00:07:57,503
而沒考慮到要專心聽佈道
paying attention to the sermon could be a little entertaining. 

167
00:07:57,505 --> 00:07:58,804
是Matt鬧起的
Matt totally started it.    

168
00:07:58,806 --> 00:08:00,438
老是說Matt的錯，是嗎？
Okay, it's always Matt's fault huh?            

169
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,606
真相就如此
Yes, actually it is.      

170
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,674
你餘生就沒想過要
Are you going to go through the rest of your life       

171
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,842
對自己行為負起責任嗎？
never taking responsibility for your actions?         

172
00:08:06,844 --> 00:08:07,776
是嗎？
Huh?              

173
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:08,743
我有想過
Yeah.              

174
00:08:08,745 --> 00:08:10,544
說真的嘛
Oh really.           

175
00:08:12,781 --> 00:08:16,115
Sheldon老大，我們正就佈道被打斷的事
Sheldon, hi, we were just talking about how sorry we are  

176
00:08:16,117 --> 00:08:18,016
深表歉意
for that interruption during the sermon.        

177
00:08:18,018 --> 00:08:21,352
希望如此啦
I should certainly hope so.   

178
00:08:21,354 --> 00:08:26,423
你知道下次故事版本就不一樣了
You understand that next time it's quite a different story?   

179
00:08:26,425 --> 00:08:27,757
我懂的
Yes sir.            

180
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,492
準備得怎麼樣？
How are the preparations going? 

181
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:31,794
他已準備好
Oh, he's ready.         

182
00:08:31,796 --> 00:08:35,430
為何不說說咱教會各大王的名呢
In fact, why don't you recite for them the names of our Lord. 

183
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:40,768
對，說說
Yes, do tell.          

184
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,536
說出來
Tell us.            

185
00:08:42,538 --> 00:08:46,139
路西法，阿發米特，別賊蔔
Lucifer, Affamet, Beezelbub.  

186
00:08:46,141 --> 00:08:49,175
是“別西蔔”才對
That's Beelzebub.        

187
00:08:49,177 --> 00:08:54,246
別西蔔，彼勒，阿巴頓
Beelzebub, Belial, Abbadon.   

188
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,150
有超過40個尊稱呢
There are over 40 of them  you know.             

189
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:03,154
年輕人，下點功夫背背
You should take time to learn them.          

190
00:09:03,156 --> 00:09:07,224
慶典為你準備很精彩的東西
There are such fabulous things in store for you.         

191
00:09:11,362 --> 00:09:14,429
我可以走了嗎？
Can I go?            

192
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,035
全體教友熱切期盼儀式的到來
We're all very excited for the ceremony.         

193
00:09:23,037 --> 00:09:24,836
同感
So am I.            

194
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:28,072
會樂也融融的
Should be fun.         

195
00:09:31,644 --> 00:09:34,544
你沒讓他破處吧？
So, you've kept him chaste?   

196
00:09:34,546 --> 00:09:37,747
都是自然守身如玉的結果
Oh, that problem kind of took care of itself.       

197
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:39,381
我還沒惹上過麻煩
You know, I never got into trouble           

198
00:09:39,383 --> 00:09:41,249
直到你家入了這教會
until your family joined this church.        

199
00:09:41,251 --> 00:09:42,883
你也沒好玩過
Yeah, and you never had any fun either.          

200
00:09:42,885 --> 00:09:43,817
是嗎？是嗎？
Did you? Did you?        

201
00:09:43,819 --> 00:09:46,085
別搞我
Get off me.           

202
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:49,721
我還沒搞清楚
You know, I still just don't understand         

203
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:51,923
這誓約的玩意
this whole oath business.    

204
00:09:51,925 --> 00:09:53,491
譬如，他們想快活就快活
Like, they made you lock up your dick             

205
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:55,593
而卻要你不破處
while they're all getting it on.

206
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,329
說不過去呢，太他媽不公平
That doesn't make any sense, it's not fucking fair.      

207
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,698
他們偷走你青春最可貴的
They're stealing the greatest part of your youth,        

208
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,701
“春色滿園關不住”
the hot steamy sexual part.   

209
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,203
為何你會同意呢？
Why would you agree with something like that?     

210
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:07,837
我不可以上床，因為不被允許
I'm not getting laid because I'm not allowed to,    

211
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,205
你想怎為我辯護？
what's your excuse?       

212
00:10:09,207 --> 00:10:10,539
我懂的
Oh, I see, I see.        

213
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:12,507
你內心的恐懼，對嗎？
So, you're scared huh?     

214
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:13,541
我不恐懼
I'm not scared.         

215
00:10:13,543 --> 00:10:14,742
不是嗎？
No, no?             

216
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:15,743
你有特殊潔癖？
You've got a little case of the vagaphobia.        

217
00:10:15,745 --> 00:10:17,010
我沒特殊潔癖
I don't have vagaphobia.    

218
00:10:17,012 --> 00:10:18,111
嚴肅說，你得
Seriously though, you've just got to,        

219
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,378
你得自己探索出這東西
you've got to figure this shit out man.        

220
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,545
以免為時已晚
Before it's too late.      

221
00:10:20,547 --> 00:10:21,779
嘿，老爸
Hey Dad.            

222
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:23,680
因為我們該
Because really Neil,what we should be doing      

223
00:10:23,682 --> 00:10:24,947
用“小弟”比試一番來看
is tripping over each others dicks to see           

224
00:10:24,949 --> 00:10:28,549
誰能泡到最多妹，悟到了嗎？
who can bag the most babes,you know?             

225
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:30,551
儘管去“幹”
Fuck something.         

226
00:10:30,553 --> 00:10:32,819
任何人
Anything.            

227
00:10:33,588 --> 00:10:34,787
那傢伙有心病
<i> That kids got problems.</i>    

228
00:10:34,789 --> 00:10:36,622
對，有病的是你
<i> Yeah, and that problem is you.</i>             

229
00:10:36,624 --> 00:10:38,357
再見，Neil
<i> Bye Neil!</i>           

230
00:10:38,359 --> 00:10:39,958
想確定一下你們倆
We just wanted to make sure that both of you         

231
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,593
是否準備好著這一切的到來
were spiritually prepared for what's going to happen.    

232
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:47,030
當然，托撒旦鴻福
Of course, it's a great honour.              

233
00:10:47,032 --> 00:10:49,732
儀式很快完，對嗎？
It will all be over very quickly, right?          

234
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:52,735
盡我所能吧
Oh, just as quick as I can make it my dear.      

235
00:10:52,737 --> 00:10:54,303
我能對你保證
I can assure you that -     

236
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:58,774
會讓短劍又快又順地刺入肉身
That the dagger plunges into the flesh swiftly, smoothly.   

237
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:00,542
聽起來會很痛苦
It sounds so painful.      

238
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:02,043
不會太痛
No, no, no.           

239
00:11:02,045 --> 00:11:04,578
他會有點癢痛，但不會太久
He'll feel a little pinch but for no more than an instant.

240
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,046
這樣說，無痛
So, no pain.          

241
00:11:06,048 --> 00:11:07,480
不是，會痛的
No, there will be pain.     

242
00:11:07,482 --> 00:11:08,714
痛不欲生
Extreme pain.          

243
00:11:08,716 --> 00:11:12,717
血流成河
And blood, lots and lots of it.          

244
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:15,086
很抱歉
I'm so sorry.          

245
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:19,756
正如之前說過，這過程不僅無痛，還很暢快
As I was saying this whole process is 
not only painless but euphoric.           

246
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:23,659
我有個瘋狂想法
I have a crazy idea.      

247
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:28,563
為何不能直接告訴他所有事呢
Why don't we just sit him down and explain everything to him,  

248
00:11:28,565 --> 00:11:30,298
這樣他心裡有個準備
that way he'll be prepared.   

249
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,099
你要跟他怎麼說呢
What are you going to tell him, okay,            

250
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:36,268
跟他說他好友會為他收屍？
that his best friend is going to have to 
mop him up after the ceremony?             

251
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,769
別說，Shelly
No. Shelly, come on.      

252
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:39,437
他會接受的
He'll accept it.        

253
00:11:39,439 --> 00:11:41,238
他深愛撒旦王的
He loves Satan.         

254
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,572
Sheldon老大，請見諒
Sheldon, I'm so sorry.     

255
00:11:42,574 --> 00:11:45,174
不必，拜託
No, no, please please.     

256
00:11:45,176 --> 00:11:50,478
不要讓小傢伙迷惑不解
There's no reason to confuse the little fellow.        

257
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,114
來不及多想了
We don't have time for second thoughts.       

258
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:58,818
如果不在他十八前黃昏，十八黎明前
If we don't perform the ritual 
on the equinox of his 18th year     

259
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,156
耶穌基督會回歸，破壞千年來的地球安寧
Jesus Christ will return and usher 
in a thousand years of peace on Earth.           

260
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:08,125
你願看到嗎？
Is that what you want?     

261
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:11,161
不
No.               

262
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,631
哥也不願
I didn't think so.       

263
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:17,767
所以，建議你拋開疑慮
So, my advice to you is to  put your misgivings aside     

264
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:21,837
一切往好的方面想
and focus on the positive.   

265
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:28,342

266
00:12:28,344 --> 00:12:29,609
吃蛋糕啊
Eat some cake.         

267
00:12:29,611 --> 00:12:31,177
對，好好享受今晚的慶典
Yeah, you should be enjoying your big night.     

268
00:12:31,179 --> 00:12:32,011

269
00:12:32,013 --> 00:12:33,312
上面加霜淇淋嗎？
Want some ice cream on that?  

270
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:36,815
當最後晚餐一樣大吃一頓
You should be eating like there's no tomorrow.       

271
00:12:36,817 --> 00:12:38,049
是個小丑呢，爸
It's a clown, dad.       

272
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:39,116
十八歲生日啊
I'm 18.             

273
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:42,185
你有什麼心事？
Why don't you tell us what's wrong?           

274
00:12:42,187 --> 00:12:44,554
為女而煩嗎？
Is it a girl?          

275
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:47,623
不是
No.               

276
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,927
實情是，有點
Actually, yeah kind of.     

277
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,697
Oh.               

278
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:01,233
有發生過什麼嗎？
Did something happen?      

279
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:03,535
細節方面，就不想勞煩你們了
I'm not going to bore you with the details.         

280
00:13:03,537 --> 00:13:05,036
你看著我
You're going to look me in the eye            

281
00:13:05,038 --> 00:13:06,570
老實跟我說
and you're going to answer me truthfully,          

282
00:13:06,572 --> 00:13:08,471
有任何身體接觸不？
was there any physical contact?       

283
00:13:08,473 --> 00:13:09,705
沒有
No.               

284
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,540
就是說沒性交？
So, there was no intercourse?  

285
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:12,908
性...沒
Inter-- No.           

286
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,509
口交呢？
And no oral?          

287
00:13:14,511 --> 00:13:16,410
卿卿我我呢？
Giving or receiving?      

288
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:17,377
沒有
No.               

289
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,644
肛交呢？
What about anal?        

290
00:13:18,646 --> 00:13:19,711
頂爆，媽
Jesus, mom!           

291
00:13:19,713 --> 00:13:21,379
答你媽，有沒肛交？
Answer your mother, was there anal?          

292
00:13:21,381 --> 00:13:22,680
沒有
No.               

293
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:24,915
我保證，發生過的事
Okay, look, something happened that will ensure     

294
00:13:24,917 --> 00:13:28,685
都沒上床這檔事
I will never get laid in my whole life.         

295
00:13:28,687 --> 00:13:31,688
兒子，你可以跟我訴任何心事
Son, look, you know you can talk to me about anything.       

296
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,323
我沒違反那蠢爆的誓約
I didn't break my stupid oath, alright.             

297
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:37,225

298
00:13:37,227 --> 00:13:40,361
那就好
Okay then.           

299
00:13:40,363 --> 00:13:42,896
那誓約不蠢呢，心肝寶貝
The oath isn't stupid honey,  

300
00:13:42,898 --> 00:13:45,665
這是你降生的主要原因
it's the whole reason you were born.          

301
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:48,334
我們在你年齡，搞大了，我們
We were your age when I conceived and we just,      

302
00:13:48,336 --> 00:13:51,603
當時不知所措，但Sheldon跟我們說
we didn't know what to do but Sheldon told us        

303
00:13:51,605 --> 00:13:55,673
你的降生有特殊目的
that you had a special purpose. 

304
00:13:55,675 --> 00:13:57,775
我相信你正遭受
Look, I'm sure you're going through           

305
00:13:57,777 --> 00:14:00,778
一些讓你困惑的懷春問題
some pretty depressing teenage stuff right now.     

306
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:03,914
我也這樣過，做過，甚至也剪過白癡髮型
Been there, done that, even I had a stupid haircut once    

307
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,783
誰不是？
didn't I?            

308
00:14:06,785 --> 00:14:10,219
但你代表咱家和教會
But you are representing our family and our church,    

309
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:12,788
當儀式結束後，你會全明白
when it is all over you will have a fuller understanding    

310
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,257
這一切的意義
of what it is all about.    

311
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:18,593
我去放水
I've got to take a leak.    

312
00:14:22,531 --> 00:14:24,864
Gary，我們需要跟他說
Gary, we need to tell him.   

313
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,899
你知道他不喜歡驚喜的Σ( ° △ °|||)︴
You know how he hates surprises,

314
00:14:26,901 --> 00:14:28,400
要是我們跟他解釋
if we just explain it to him.  

315
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,235
死也不可！
Absolutely not!         

316
00:14:30,237 --> 00:14:33,238
他會壞場，哭場，鬧場，叫場的！
He'll cause a scene, crying and kicking and screaming.    

317
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,040
你想別人笑話嗎？
Do you want other people to see that?           

318
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:38,375
你都聽到了
Look, you heard , okay,     

319
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,745
他已飽受夠多的屈辱了，信我
he has suffered enough humiliation, trust me.      

320
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:45,815
我們沒權選擇Neil的命運
We did not choose Neil's destiny.          

321
00:14:46,717 --> 00:14:47,916
他自己選擇的
He did.             

322
00:14:47,918 --> 00:14:52,986

323

<i> Abbadon, Beelzebub...</i>     

328
00:15:04,698 --> 00:15:07,331
讓你們知道不僅是Neil
I want you to know that it won't just be Neil        

329
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:10,900
從他犧牲裡獲得恩賜
who will be rewarded for his sacrifice.        

330
00:15:10,902 --> 00:15:12,868
為新紀元碰杯
To a new era.      

331
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:15,403
為新紀元碰杯
To a new era.          

332
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:17,671
感謝
Thank you.

快日落了，甜心
It's almost sundown, dear.   

335
00:15:22,043 --> 00:15:24,343
失陪一下？
Oh, would you kindly excuse us? 

336
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:26,411
請便
Of course.

晚上好

我因你自豪
I am so proud of you.      

342
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:51,563
謝媽
Thanks.             

343
00:15:51,565 --> 00:15:54,599
你一向都很聽話的
You've been such a good son.  

344
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,583
兄弟在此
There he is buddy, huh?               

345

風雲人物
Man of the hour.        

346
00:16:16,787 --> 00:16:18,787
聽說你跨入成年世界一刻
Listen, I heard that after the confirmation      

347
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:23,591
這廳的女人任你選的哦
you get to bone any woman you want 
from within the congregation.              

348
00:16:23,593 --> 00:16:24,925
換作我，我會選Colette，
If it were me I'd go for Colette

349
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:26,826
讓她男友乾瞪眼

別給我抹黑
Don't embarrass me.       

351
00:16:28,963 --> 00:16:30,395
我有過嗎？
Do I ever?           

352
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:31,829

353
00:16:31,831 --> 00:16:34,898
好了，各位信眾，開場了
Okay everybody, time to get started.       

354
00:16:54,785 --> 00:16:56,851
雞凍嗎？
Are you excited?        

355

兄弟姐妹們
Brothers and sisters,      

356
00:17:07,529 --> 00:17:11,097
咱們為了一古代儀式，齊聚一堂
we are gathered together for an ancient ceremony.     

357
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,100
莊嚴又美好
Momentous and beautiful.    

358
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:18,003
大會開始前，請關上你們的行動電話
Before we begin please turn off your cell phones       

359
00:17:18,005 --> 00:17:20,505
及相關電子設備
and all other electronic devices.             

360
00:17:20,507 --> 00:17:26,009

361
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:30,813
十八年前，咱們大王選了這小子
Eighteen years ago our Lord chose this young man       

362
00:17:30,815 --> 00:17:34,850
加入我們陣線對抗“大騙子”（耶穌）
to join him in battle against the Great Deceiver.    

363
00:17:34,852 --> 00:17:40,155
他的聖靈今晚會跟大王匯合
His spirit will join with the Father on this night.     

364
00:17:40,157 --> 00:17:41,990
現在我們請求Neil小子的
We now ask young Neil      

365
00:17:41,992 --> 00:17:47,862
俗世軀殼躺上我們的祭壇
to lay his earthly vessel upon our altar.          

366
00:17:47,864 --> 00:17:51,932
作為我們大王的僕人
Handmaidens of our Lord.    

367
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,211
老兄
Dude.              

368
00:18:05,213 --> 00:18:07,179
估計他們會當著
I think they're going to fuck you         

369
00:18:07,181 --> 00:18:09,147
眾人的面幹你
right here in front of everyone.       

370
00:18:09,149 --> 00:18:11,816

In Nomina Satanas.

<i> In Nomina Satanas.</i>      

372
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,087
現在是時候釋放他的聖靈
Now the time approaches to release his spirit       

373
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:20,824
到我們大王的身邊
into the arms of our father   

374
00:18:20,826 --> 00:18:28,198
從此以後，他的聖靈會永世伴隨大王
whereupon his soul will join our King for all eternity.    

375
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:35,070
被宰的“羔羊”會跟路西法下地獄相隨
The sacrificial lamb will stand with Lucifer in Hades.      

376
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:37,072
哇，哇，被宰的羔羊？
Whoa, whoa, sacrificial lamb?  

377
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,440
比喻而已
It's a metaphor.        

378
00:18:38,442 --> 00:18:41,342
一旦撕開處男的肉身
As we tear the virgins flesh asunder           

379
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:46,046
鮮血一湧而出，以作祭忌聖體
so that the blood may spill forth in holy offering.      

380
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:49,682
撒旦王在下
<i>In Nomina Satanas,</i> 

381
00:18:49,684 --> 00:18:52,785
撒旦王在下
<i> In Nomina Satanas...</i>     

382
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,853
撒旦王在下
<i> In Nomina Satanas,</i>      

383
00:18:54,855 --> 00:18:56,421
老兄
Dude.              

384
00:18:56,423 --> 00:18:58,089
撒旦大王
Satanas Rex.          

385
00:18:58,091 --> 00:18:59,223
老兄
Dude!              

386
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:01,191
哇哇哇，搞什麼？
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what the?   

387
00:19:01,193 --> 00:19:02,225
撒旦王在...
In Nomina...          

388
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:03,059
搞飛機！
What the fuck!         

389
00:19:03,061 --> 00:19:05,027
撒旦王！
Satanas!            

390
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:05,961
Neil! Neil!           

391
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:06,695
嗨！
Hey!              

392
00:19:06,697 --> 00:19:08,296
Neil!              

393
00:19:08,298 --> 00:19:09,697
抓住他！
After him!           

394
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:11,131
Neil!              

395
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,768
回來
Get back here!         

396
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:16,935
快跑
Go, go, go!           

397
00:19:16,937 --> 00:19:18,870
快跑
Move, move, move!        

398
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:22,273
勒個去
Okay, holy shit.        

399
00:19:22,275 --> 00:19:23,674
快跑
Come on.            

400
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:34,316
草
Oh fuck!!!!!!!         

401
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:51,799
過來，快
Come here, quickly!       

402
00:19:51,801 --> 00:19:53,000
給力
Come on.            

403
00:19:53,002 --> 00:19:54,601
他們在嗎？
Are they there?         

404
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:55,568
我另外一隻鞋呢
Where's my other shoe?     

405
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:58,837
我另外一隻鞋呢
Where's my other shoe?     

406
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,338
太抱歉了，Sheldon
I am so sorry, Sheldon.     

407
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,774
不知道說什麼好
I mean, what can I say?     

408
00:20:03,776 --> 00:20:06,243
你啥不必說
You can say nothing!      

409
00:20:06,245 --> 00:20:08,144

410
00:20:08,146 --> 00:20:09,778
接一下
Get that.            

411
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:11,079
Hello?             

412
00:20:11,081 --> 00:20:12,980
日出前要搞定，否者時機就過了
We have until sunrise or the window will close.     

413
00:20:12,982 --> 00:20:17,150
要是失敗了，撒旦的憤怒會降臨我們頭上
If we fail his wrath will fall on us all!       

414
00:20:17,152 --> 00:20:19,252
不，這不會發生
No, that won't happen.     

415
00:20:19,254 --> 00:20:21,387
我逮他回來，馬上上祭壇
I'll go get him he'll be back on that altar in no time.     

416
00:20:22,923 --> 00:20:26,990
不，你留在這
No! You stay right here.    

417
00:20:26,992 --> 00:20:31,160
帶上這兩個，抓他回來
Take these two with you and fetch them back.       

418
00:20:31,162 --> 00:20:36,097
耍軟的，讓他乖乖回來
We need a soft touch to lure them back.            

419
00:20:36,099 --> 00:20:39,133
你懂我說啥，是嗎，Colette?
You know what I'm talking about,don't you Colette?        

420
00:20:39,135 --> 00:20:40,868
嗯
I think so.           

421
00:20:40,870 --> 00:20:44,504
聰明女，去
Good girl, now go.       

422
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:52,078
記住，給平時一樣低調行事
And remember, as always to keep a low profile.      

423
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:58,384
你們，要是他們回不來
And you, if they don't return  

424
00:20:58,386 --> 00:21:01,220
考慮開除你會籍
consider yourself excommunicated

425
00:21:01,222 --> 00:21:04,289
你永遠看不到“地獄之門”
and you will never see the gates of Hell!        

426
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:14,998
Matt! Matt!           

427
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,733
你搞什麼，Matt
What the fuck are you doing, Matt!               

428
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:17,834
搞飛機啊
What the fuck, man?       

429
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:19,135
你不能拿
You can't take that,      

430
00:21:19,137 --> 00:21:20,836
那是我家暑假墨西哥旅行費
that's my families Mexico money for the summer.   

431
00:21:20,838 --> 00:21:22,170
我深感抱歉
Oh, I'm sorry          

432
00:21:22,172 --> 00:21:24,405
你去墨國Acapulco玩爽點
why don't you enjoy your lovely time in Acapulco      

433
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:29,142
還有記得他們要你命前寄明信片給我
and don't forget to send me a 
postcard before they murder you.       

434
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:33,346
老兄，我爸也是個混蛋
Dude, look my Dad's an asshole too, okay.       

435
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:36,582
同感
I know.             

436
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:38,250
蠢爆
Oh fuck me.           

437
00:21:38,252 --> 00:21:39,484
打給員警就好
I'm calling the cops.      

438
00:21:39,486 --> 00:21:40,251
什麼？
What?              

439
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:41,218
別這麼做
No, no, no, don't do that.   

440
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,851
別
Don't do that.         

441
00:21:41,853 --> 00:21:42,518
死開
Fuck off.            

442
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,052
別
Don't do that.         

443
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:45,253
我爸是警員，半數警員入我們教會
Alright, my Dad's a cop and half
the force goes to our church.   

444
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:46,153
報警
Police, please.         

445
00:21:46,155 --> 00:21:47,521
不，給我
No, give me.          

446
00:21:47,523 --> 00:21:48,321
Hello?             

447
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:49,155
警察局
<i> This is the police.</i>      

448
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,222
嗨，我是Matt，Paul的兒子
Hey. It's Matt, Paul's kid.   

449
00:21:50,224 --> 00:21:51,823
我爸變成禽獸了
My Dad's gone rogue.      

450
00:21:51,825 --> 00:21:53,024
Matt，你在哪？
<i> Matt, where are you?</i>     

451
00:21:53,026 --> 00:21:54,191
我在朋友Neil的家
I'm at my friend Neil's house. 

452
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:55,825
Neil跟你一起嗎？
<i> Is Neil with you?</i>       

453
00:21:55,827 --> 00:21:57,426
在那別亂跑，我派人過去
<i> Stay where you are, we'll</i>    
<i> send somebody right now.</i>     

454
00:21:57,428 --> 00:21:58,593
你派誰過來
Who are you sending?      

455
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:00,194
Matt，在那別亂跑
<i>st  stay  where  you  are  Matt.</i>

456
00:22:00,196 --> 00:22:01,395
草
Oh shit, fuck!         

457
00:22:01,397 --> 00:22:02,996
我們得跑
We've got to go!        

458
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:08,267
遜爆，現在本可以在Cheryl家參加派對
This sucks, alright, we could be at Cheryl's party right now  

459
00:22:08,269 --> 00:22:12,870
好好享受陰道自助餐或嗎啡
totally enjoying the all  you can 
eat vagina buffet or muffet if you will.       

460
00:22:12,872 --> 00:22:14,271
等一下
Wait.              

461
00:22:14,273 --> 00:22:17,374
這一切都是因為你是處男，
This all happened because you're a virgin right,      

462
00:22:17,376 --> 00:22:21,110
這樣的話，破處了，問題就解決了
so we get you laid problem solved.          

463
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:24,412
我懂了
Oh, I've got it.        

464
00:22:24,414 --> 00:22:25,746
你打給誰
Who are you calling?      

465
00:22:25,748 --> 00:22:27,347
別打電話
Stop, stop, stop calling people.

466
00:22:27,349 --> 00:22:29,182
為何？
Okay, what?           

467
00:22:29,184 --> 00:22:30,349
找Denise！
Denise!             

468
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:32,084
老友愛愛，太絕了
A friend fuck, oh that's brilliant.         

469
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:34,252
快。之前一直給她“騎著”
Come on, I mean we give her rides all the time I mean.  

470
00:22:46,966 --> 00:22:49,266

471
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,475
Neil!              

472
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,747
小Matt？
Matty?             

473
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:05,547
你們在嗎？
You guys here?         

474
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:07,048
出來！
Come on out!          

475
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:09,283

476
00:23:34,242 --> 00:23:35,941
你想太多了
You're overthinking this, man.               

477
00:23:35,943 --> 00:23:37,342
她是我朋友，好不好
She's my friend, alright,    

478
00:23:37,344 --> 00:23:39,677
我不想讓她覺得被利用了
I just don't want her to feel like she's being used.      

479
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,279
她沒被利用，她在救你狗命
She's not being used,she's saving your life.      

480
00:23:42,281 --> 00:23:43,546
她是在救我命
I know, she's saving my life.             

481
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,047
千真萬確
Exactly.            

482
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,548
這就是我跟他坦白的原因
That's why I'm just going to tell her the truth, alright.   

483
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,083
Denise人太好，她會理解的
Denise is super cool,man, she'll totally get it.    

484
00:23:49,085 --> 00:23:52,219
不，你出發點很好，但女人不太肯
No, that's sweet okay but women don't really respond well 

485
00:23:52,221 --> 00:23:55,388
面對真相，他們喜歡神秘
to the truth okay, it's like they like mystery.      

486
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,522
像你的魔術
It's like your magic.      

487
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:57,756
要是你揭穿魔術
If you told them how you did the magic             

488
00:23:57,758 --> 00:24:00,058
你就失去魔力
you lose the magic, right?   

489
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,759
問我雞巴多長
Ask me how big my dick is.   

490
00:24:01,761 --> 00:24:02,726
什麼
What?              

491
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:04,194
為何要我問這個
Why would I ask you that?    

492
00:24:04,196 --> 00:24:05,562
除非我都看過
Besides, I've seen it.     

493
00:24:05,564 --> 00:24:06,696
腳趾這麼長
It looks like a toe.      

494
00:24:06,698 --> 00:24:10,366
給點耐心，問就好
Just bear with me okay, just ask.             

495
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:13,435
你雞巴多長
How big is your dick.      

496
00:24:13,437 --> 00:24:15,870
原則上，我不喜歡張揚
Well, I don't really like to talk about it but, you know,   

497
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,304
24cm
it's 9 and a half inches.    

498
00:24:17,306 --> 00:24:21,774
現在輪到我問，你雞巴多長
Okay, see, now I'll ask you, how big is your dick?       

499
00:24:21,776 --> 00:24:23,075
我不知道，還沒量過
I don't know, I've never measured it.           

500
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:23,708
平均長度？
Average?            

501
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:25,376
不對，25cm
Wrong! Ten inches.       

502
00:24:25,378 --> 00:24:26,477
為何要撒謊
Why would I lie?        

503
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:27,578
要是撒謊了，會被拆穿的
If the lie works I'm going to get caught.          

504
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,079
有何關係，世事就這樣
It doesn't matter that's the thing.         

505
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:31,214
當她發現只有13cm
Okay, by the time she finds out that it's only five inches  

506
00:24:31,216 --> 00:24:33,282
都已經進去5cm
it's two inches deep.      

507
00:24:34,652 --> 00:24:37,285
Matt，你呆在這
Oh, okay, okay Matt you're going to stay outside, okay.   

508
00:24:37,287 --> 00:24:38,419
我不會當旁證的
I'm not doing this for an audience.           

509
00:24:38,421 --> 00:24:39,720
很好
Fine.              

510
00:24:39,722 --> 00:24:41,121
好的
That's fine.          

511
00:24:41,123 --> 00:24:42,455
我會洗手的
I wash my hands of this,    

512
00:24:42,457 --> 00:24:45,957
我在這打電話好了
I just I'll just be out here making phone calls.        

513
00:24:45,959 --> 00:24:47,658

514
00:24:50,796 --> 00:24:52,495
沒去Cheryl那裡？
No Cheryl's, huh?        

515
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:54,497
對她沒那個
Wasn't-- Wasn't feeling it,   

516
00:24:54,499 --> 00:24:57,600
可以進來嗎
um, can I come in?       

517
00:24:57,602 --> 00:24:58,901
當然，怎麼不可
Yeah, sure, why not.      

518
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,272
你父母在家嗎
Are your parents home?     

519
00:25:04,274 --> 00:25:07,441
沒
No.               

520
00:25:07,443 --> 00:25:10,076
在這關卡住兩天了
I've been stuck on this level for like two days.        

521
00:25:10,078 --> 00:25:13,512
第三天還這樣，就鐵定心腸上網找外掛
I swear, one more day of this and I am 
pillaging the internet for cheat codes.         

522
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,546
老兄，能坐下嗎，好煩人呢
Dude, can you sit down,this is pretty annoying.     

523
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,850
好的，我要聊一下
Okay, okay, I really need to talk.             

524
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:24,586
我真需要跟你談些東西
I really need to talk to you about something.         

525
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,454
比較大的事
It's kind of a big deal.    

526
00:25:26,456 --> 00:25:28,823
好的，說啊
Okay, talk.           

527
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,257
嗯
Yeah.              

528
00:25:30,259 --> 00:25:34,294
只有Denise可以這麼忙！
Only Denise can be this busy!  

529
00:25:34,296 --> 00:25:35,628
搞啥
Okay.              

530
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:36,962
嗨，Amy
Hey, Amy.            

531
00:25:36,964 --> 00:25:38,430
是Matt，聽我說
It's Matt, listen.       

532
00:25:38,432 --> 00:25:42,000
今晚有些瘋狂事發生
There's some crazy shit going down tonight           

533
00:25:42,002 --> 00:25:44,969
世界末日之類的狗屎
like end of the world type stuff

534
00:25:44,971 --> 00:25:47,137
Cheryl的派對可能是你
so Cheryl's party might be your last chance        

535
00:25:47,139 --> 00:25:49,005
跟我最後道別？
to get with me, alright?    

536
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:51,307
回頭見
Holler back.          

537
00:25:51,309 --> 00:25:53,309
你知道我多尊重你的
You know how much I respect you.          

538
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:53,976
嗯
Yeah.              

539
00:25:53,978 --> 00:25:57,679
很尊重，嗯
So much, yeah, okay.      

540
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:01,448
我覺得你很棒
Um, I think you're awesome.   

541
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:05,150
我覺得你有點呆
I think you're kind of a dork.              

542
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:06,518
我即將要說的
Uh, what I am about to ask   

543
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:09,920
未曾跟其他人說過
I can never ask anybody else.  

544
00:26:12,357 --> 00:26:14,490
好的，喜劇大師
Okay, drama queen.       

545
00:26:14,492 --> 00:26:18,160
只想你對我說，可以為我做件事
I just need you to say that you 
will do this one thing for me   

546
00:26:18,162 --> 00:26:21,730
我承諾以後不會再向你這樣要求
and I promise I will never ask you for anything ever again    

547
00:26:21,732 --> 00:26:24,799
只要我活著，可能活不長
as long as I live, which might not be for long.      

548
00:26:24,801 --> 00:26:28,502
說來聽聽
Lets hear it.          

549
00:26:28,504 --> 00:26:31,571
我要你今晚跟我做愛
I need you to have sex with me tonight.         

550
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:35,607
如果你不肯，我會死
If you don't I'm going to die. 

551
00:26:36,409 --> 00:26:37,875
我只要放它進去
I just, I just need to put it in

552
00:26:37,877 --> 00:26:39,810
不必有任何花招
it doesn't have to be anything special.         

553
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:41,545
我不知道會“幹”成什麼樣子
I don't know what the fuck I'm going to be doing       

554
00:26:41,547 --> 00:26:43,647
我甚至連規則都不清楚，我不清楚...
but I don't even know the rules I don't know I just -       

555
00:26:43,649 --> 00:26:45,715
搞什麼飛機，Neil？
What the fuck, Neil?      

556
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,253
今晚有些瘋狂事發生
There's some crazy shit going down tonight        

557
00:26:52,255 --> 00:26:55,522
世界末日之類的狗屎，所以Cheryl派對
like end of the world type stuff 
so Cheryl's party might be    

558
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:58,892
可能是我的最後道別？
your last chance to get with me so.            

559
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:00,493
回頭見
Holler back.          

560
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,194
正常來說，我不會想到跟你做任何事
Normally I would never think of doing anything      

561
00:27:02,196 --> 00:27:03,662
更別說是做愛
remotely sexual with you    

562
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,530
但我真他媽太性急了
but I am really fucking desperate.     

563
00:27:05,532 --> 00:27:08,399
我只要你讓我幹
I just need you to just let me just fuck             

564
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:11,235
沒別的意思
like just no meaning to it,   

565
00:27:11,237 --> 00:27:13,503
幹一下就好，成事就好
just the tip,anything will work.            

566
00:27:13,505 --> 00:27:15,438
繼續說，情聖，我底褲都濕了
Oh, keep going lover boy really my panties are dripping, 

567
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,071
說真的
I swear.            

568
00:27:16,073 --> 00:27:17,705

569
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:18,505
他們來了
They're here!          

570
00:27:18,507 --> 00:27:20,240
草
Holy fuck!           

571
00:27:20,242 --> 00:27:21,574
噢
Oh.               

572
00:27:21,576 --> 00:27:22,374
Denise.             

573
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:23,608
好的，我們做吧
Okay, lets do it.        

574
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:24,542
真的，你這些突然髒話很吸引
Really, the sheer balls of it is impressive.         

575
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,110
我不是實際跟你幹
I'm not fucking with you okay,          

576
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,878
你知道我家入了什麼教吧
you know the church my family belongs to?       

577
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,713
有點邪那種
It's kind of different.     

578
00:27:29,715 --> 00:27:32,082
他們想殺了我
Well, they just tried to sacrifice me          

579
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:33,516
因為我是處男
because I'm a virgin.      

580
00:27:33,518 --> 00:27:35,050
什麼
What?              

581
00:27:35,052 --> 00:27:36,618

582
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,752
我之前沒做愛過
I've never had sex before.   

583
00:27:37,754 --> 00:27:38,886
我清楚處男長啥樣
Yeah, I know what a fucking virgin is         

584
00:27:38,888 --> 00:27:40,354
但你在說什麼？
but what the fuck are you talking about?      

585
00:27:40,356 --> 00:27:42,923
除非今晚我失身
Unless I lose my virginity tonight              

586
00:27:42,925 --> 00:27:44,858
否則他們會宰了我
they're going to sacrifice my ass!              

587
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,059
獻給撒旦
To Satan!            

588
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:48,261
他們在這了
They're here! Come on!     

589
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:48,894
頂爆
Oh my god!           

590
00:27:48,896 --> 00:27:50,595

591
00:27:50,597 --> 00:27:51,762
Denise，不是跟你開玩笑
Denise, it's not fucking funny! 

592
00:27:51,764 --> 00:27:54,598

593
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,099
Oh.               

594
00:27:56,101 --> 00:27:58,634
我要你知道是否可以
Listen, I need to know if this is going to happen      

595
00:27:58,636 --> 00:27:59,868
否者我要逃命了
or I've really got to run.   

596
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,302
Neil，我不清楚你搞哪一出
Neil, I don't know what the fuck you're on        

597
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:03,237
但你現在真混蛋呢
but you're being a real asshole right now.        

598
00:28:03,239 --> 00:28:04,238
我去開門了
I'm going to get the door.   

599
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,606
天啊，聽我說
Oh my god, listen to me.    

600
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:07,674
死了
Oh fuck.            

601
00:28:09,811 --> 00:28:11,710
何事
Yeah?              

602
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:13,111
這很煩人
Hey, oh my god this is so annoying            

603
00:28:13,113 --> 00:28:15,880
但你有見過Neil嗎
but you wouldn't happen to have seen Neil?        

604
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:17,314
沒
No.               

605
00:28:17,316 --> 00:28:19,449
我們剛才在商場玩過來
Well, we were all just hanging out at the mall you know,     

606
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:23,719
聽著CD，然後他就跑了
listening to CD's  and he just ran off.       

607
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:25,087
我們猜他可能發神經
We think he might be losing his mind          

608
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:27,589
我們很擔心呢
we were just really worried so. 

609
00:28:27,591 --> 00:28:30,158
一直在胡說八道
Well, he was babbling nonsense. 

610
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,094
這樣說，你見過他？
So, you saw him?        

611
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:34,261
對
Yeah.              

612
00:28:34,263 --> 00:28:36,296
可以跟我們說他跑哪嗎
Do you want to maybe tell us where he went?          

613
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,765
抱歉，你們是誰
Sorry, who are you guys?    

614
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:42,001
我是Brad，要是你幫上忙
Oh hi, I'm Brad and it would be really helpful         

615
00:28:42,003 --> 00:28:44,869
就幫大忙了
if you could help us find him. 

616
00:28:46,772 --> 00:28:49,038
好的，進來
Alright, uh yeah, come in.   

617
00:28:52,676 --> 00:28:54,275
他們怎知道在這的
How'd they know we were here?  

618
00:28:54,277 --> 00:28:54,975
不清楚
I don't know.          

619
00:28:54,977 --> 00:28:56,009
草起了
Fucked!             

620
00:28:56,011 --> 00:28:58,344
草
Oh shit, shit, shit.      

621
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,611
這褲太緊身
These pants are too tight.   

622
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,244
好的
Okay.              

623
00:29:00,246 --> 00:29:01,111
噢，我的蛋蛋
Ow, my nuts!          

624
00:29:01,113 --> 00:29:03,246
給力點，我幫你
Come on, come on. I've got you. 

625
00:29:03,248 --> 00:29:03,980
快跑
Lets go.            

626
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:05,081
跑
Go.               

627
00:29:05,083 --> 00:29:06,782
沿著這條街走
So, it's just down this street here            

628
00:29:06,784 --> 00:29:10,652
是單行道，所以你要經過橡樹過去
oh but it's a one way so you should just go around via Oak   

629
00:29:10,654 --> 00:29:13,721
而Cheryl的家應該在那
and Cheryl's house should just be right there.       

630
00:29:18,961 --> 00:29:21,494
你太幫忙了，謝謝
You've been incredibly helpful, thank you.            

631
00:29:21,496 --> 00:29:23,496
還有你們怎麼認識Neil的
Yeah, how do you guys know Neal again?            

632
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:24,630
教會認識的
From church.          

633
00:29:24,632 --> 00:29:25,797
什麼教會
What church is that?      

634
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,698
你沒聽過的
You've never heard of it.    

635
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,766
我們崇拜撒旦
We worship Satan.        

636
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:40,943
草
Fuck.              

637
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,081
老兄，你什麼也沒損失
Dude, you have nothing to lose.             

638
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:50,718
不，蒙羞比死更難堪
No, humiliation is worse than death.            

639
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,786
你不會見過有傢伙
You've never walked into a room where everybody      

640
00:29:52,788 --> 00:29:54,154
在房間裡打飛機
has seen you wearing jizz.   

641
00:29:54,156 --> 00:29:58,157
我見過
Ah, yes. I have.        

642
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,159
我做不到，我選擇死亡
I can't do it, I choose death. 

643
00:30:00,161 --> 00:30:01,994
不可以
No, no, no, no, no.       

644
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:03,161
等一下
Wait, wait, wait okay.     

645
00:30:03,163 --> 00:30:04,795
你父母今晚幾乎殺了你
Your parents almost killing you tonight        

646
00:30:04,797 --> 00:30:07,063
可能對你說是幸事
that's the best thing that could have happened to you.    

647
00:30:07,065 --> 00:30:09,799
他們在你背後點一把火
They lit a fire under your ass to go out there grab       

648
00:30:09,801 --> 00:30:15,471
口裡說著甜言蜜語，實則蛇蠍心腸
life by the ears and make sweet sweet love to his mouth.  

649
00:30:15,473 --> 00:30:19,574
你是自私鬼，知道嗎
Fuck, you're a selfish prick you know that?          

650
00:30:19,576 --> 00:30:20,975
我怎麼自私
How am I selfish?        

651
00:30:20,977 --> 00:30:23,510
因為這是你最後機會，Neil
Because this is your last chance, Neil.        

652
00:30:23,512 --> 00:30:25,111
要是你不進去破了你處男膜
If you don't go in there and bust your hymen        

653
00:30:25,113 --> 00:30:26,745
那麼你就是個死人
then you're a dead man.     

654
00:30:26,747 --> 00:30:27,979
這一切都入了我腦
And then that's on my head   

655
00:30:27,981 --> 00:30:33,417
我不能這樣苟且餘生，狠狠大幹一場吧
and I can't live with that shit so fuck you.         

656
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:36,086
我不想成為你人生的遺憾事
I wouldn't want me dying to be a source of guilt for you   

657
00:30:36,088 --> 00:30:38,421
或任何陰影
or anything.          

658
00:30:38,423 --> 00:30:40,989
這才是嘛
Yes!              

659
00:30:43,093 --> 00:30:49,296

660
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:52,766
看，沒你想像的差
Aw, see, it's not so bad huh?  

661
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:57,804
草，這邊我給你來點啤酒
Uh, shit, uh lets get you a beer this way.         

662
00:30:57,806 --> 00:31:00,273
美女們，認識Neal嗎？
Ladies, you guys know Neal right?              

663
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:00,873
Hi Neal.            

664
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:01,807
Hey.              

665
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:03,875
可以跟你玩一個嗎
Oh, can I play one with you?  

666
00:31:03,877 --> 00:31:06,110
醉了，醉了，啤酒灌倒了
Here we go, here we go, beer pong baby.          

667
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:14,884
Neal,等一下
Neal, wait, Neal. Neal!     

668
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:18,520
大家看，那個自摸男
Hey, look everybody it's the man himself!       

669
00:31:18,522 --> 00:31:20,588
我們一起來Neal
Lets all do the fucking Neal!  

670
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:32,632
老兄，嗨
Dude, hey.           

671
00:31:35,703 --> 00:31:37,002
天啊，我所見過的其他人
Oh my god, that was the worst thing          

672
00:31:37,004 --> 00:31:39,204
最惡劣的一幕
I've ever seen happen to anybody.            

673
00:31:39,206 --> 00:31:42,273
你要來一杯
You need a shot.        

674
00:31:46,712 --> 00:31:47,844
為絕地翻身而碰杯
To hitting bottom.       

675
00:31:47,846 --> 00:31:49,378
無處可逃，唯有頂上
Nowhere to go but up.      

676
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,980
無處可逃
Nowhere.            

677
00:31:51,982 --> 00:31:55,216
太難受了
Oh, oh that's awful.      

678
00:32:01,991 --> 00:32:06,259

679
00:32:14,868 --> 00:32:17,001

680
00:32:17,003 --> 00:32:18,335
誰在裡面
<i>Who's in there?</i>

681
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:21,237
想必是飛機男
<i> I think it's that masturbating guy.</i>        

682
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,905
老兄，你在裡面打飛機嗎
<i>Hey  man,  you  jerking  off in  there?</i>            

683
00:32:22,907 --> 00:32:23,839

684
00:32:23,841 --> 00:32:25,006
需要伴奏嗎，老兄
<i> Need some rhythm bro?</i>     

685
00:32:25,008 --> 00:32:28,376
一下！兩下！三下！

698
00:32:51,863 --> 00:32:55,931

699
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:01,802
你以為自己做什麼
What the fuck do you think you're doing?           

700
00:33:03,238 --> 00:33:05,538
哇
<i> Whoa!!!</i>            

701
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,039
肅靜
Behold!             

702
00:33:07,041 --> 00:33:10,642
飛機大師
The Great Master Bater.     

703
00:33:10,644 --> 00:33:13,478

704
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:17,881
我史無前例露一下我的陰莖術
And I give to you my fabulous phallus of fun.          

705
00:33:17,883 --> 00:33:20,783
噢
<i>Oooh!</i>        

706
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:28,155

707
00:33:28,157 --> 00:33:31,625

708

謝謝，謝謝
Thank you, thank you.      

709
00:33:33,128 --> 00:33:36,795
現在我要一位志願者做下一個魔術
Now, I need a volunteer for this next trick.       

710
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:40,030
你如何
How about um you.        

711

草你
Fuck that.           

712
00:33:42,267 --> 00:33:44,233
沒膽鬼一個呢，童鞋們
We've got a bashful one,folks.              

713
00:33:44,235 --> 00:33:46,068
給他打一下氣
Lets give him some encouragement.        

714
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:46,902
Kent!              

715
00:33:46,904 --> 00:33:48,236
Kent!              

716
00:33:48,238 --> 00:33:49,971

721
00:33:56,679 --> 00:33:57,944
Kent! Kent.           

722
00:33:57,946 --> 00:34:04,316

723
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:08,419
現在，我要全場安靜
Now, I need complete silence for this next trick.       

724
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,188
敢碰我，你死無全屍
Touch me and you're a dead man.            

725
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,956
噢！！！
<i>Oooh!!!!!</i>

挑一張，任何一張
Pick a card, any card.

任何牌
Any card at all.

現在讓全場看看
Now show it to the room.    

731
00:34:30,973 --> 00:34:33,039
都看清楚了嗎
Did you guys get a good look?           

732
00:34:33,041 --> 00:34:35,106
現在放回去
Now put it back.        

733
00:34:36,876 --> 00:34:37,975
好的
Alright.            

734
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:41,945
Kent，是你那張嗎

不是
No.               

738
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:51,185
看一下你的褲子
Oh. Check your pants.      

739
00:34:51,187 --> 00:34:53,153
看什麼？
Check my what?

你褲子
Your pants.           

741
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,891
草
Fuck!              

742
00:34:58,893 --> 00:34:59,791
搞什麼飛機
What the fuck!         

743
00:34:59,793 --> 00:35:06,797

744

謝謝
Thank you.

That was, that was pretty awesome.          

746
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:18,741
要看加場版嗎
Yeah, you want to see another one?           

747
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:20,809
或許
Maybe.             

748
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:33,153

749
00:35:33,155 --> 00:35:43,596

750
00:35:49,103 --> 00:35:50,368
草
Oh fuck.            

751
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:51,836
就
Just!              

752
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:08,051
喜歡我內內嗎
Like my outfit?         

753
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:09,185
真精緻

00:36:12,623 --> 00:36:14,389
摸一下我膝蓋底
Take the back of the knee,right,              

756
00:36:14,391 --> 00:36:16,624
出奇的敏感
it's surprisingly sensitive.  

757
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:19,426
不總是只有陰蒂才
It can't always be about the clitoris.           

758
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:21,694
嗨，你來我教會呢
Oh hey, you go to my church.           

759
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:22,695

I know, right?         

765
00:36:31,037 --> 00:36:32,536
他在哪
Where is he?          

766
00:36:32,538 --> 00:36:35,038
不，我不會告訴你
No, no, no, no, I'm not telling you.       

767
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,106
對你而言，我不會說
You I'm not going to tell.   

768
00:36:37,108 --> 00:36:39,741
求你啦
Please tell me?         

769
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:42,210
求求求你
Please? Please?         

770
00:36:42,212 --> 00:36:43,611
告訴我
Tell me?            

771
00:36:43,613 --> 00:36:45,813
你聞起來像肉桂
You smell like cinnamon.    

772
00:36:45,815 --> 00:36:48,649
好，我告訴你
Okay, okay, okay I'll tell you okay             

773
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:53,720
但你來遲了，他已經在做愛了
but you're a little late because he's already having sex.     

774
00:37:01,796 --> 00:37:03,428
你喜歡什麼花式
So, what are you into?     

775
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:06,798
除了魔術，還有電視遊戲
Besides magic I like video games,           

776
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,166
還有火箭之類
I kind of like the retro stuff 

777
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:11,435
因為很像玩遊戲
because it's more about the game play.       

778
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:14,671
我是說床上
I meant like in bed.      

779
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:16,572
呃
Uh.               

780
00:37:17,841 --> 00:37:21,008
你要幹我，要嗎
You want to fuck me, don't you?            

781
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,111
這就幫大忙了
That would be super helpful.  

782
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:26,278
是
Yeah.              

783
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:27,078
我是說是的
I mean yes.           

784
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,146
好的
Ok.               

785
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,753
Neal?              

786
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:39,222
Neal，你在上面嗎
Neal, are you up here?     

787
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,826
你準備好嗎
Are you ready?         

788
00:37:43,828 --> 00:37:45,261
七七八八了
I think so.           

789
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:46,395
你感覺準備好
You feel ready.         

790
00:37:46,397 --> 00:37:48,029
準備好
I feel ready.          

791
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:53,200
不是那情況的
This is not what it looks like!               

792
00:37:53,202 --> 00:37:55,635
Cheryl？真的？
Cheryl? Really?         

793
00:37:55,637 --> 00:37:56,969
我問你先的
I asked you first.       

794
00:37:56,971 --> 00:37:58,637
我來只是提醒你
You know I just came to warn you that these people       

795
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,039
你教友正趕來
from your church are coming.  

796
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,740
我們可以繼續嗎
Oh. Can we still do this?    

797
00:38:02,742 --> 00:38:05,109
你開啥玩笑
You're kidding, right?     

798
00:38:11,116 --> 00:38:12,915
死了
Oh shit, fuck.         

799
00:38:12,917 --> 00:38:14,950
做點事
Do something.          

800
00:38:27,463 --> 00:38:28,795
太驚險了
That was close.         

801
00:38:28,797 --> 00:38:30,129
快跑
Lets go.            

802
00:38:30,131 --> 00:38:32,397
不，我在這，幫你拖延點時間
No, I'll stay here and buy you some time.            

803
00:38:32,399 --> 00:38:33,264
Denise，這不安全
Denise, it's not safe.     

804
00:38:33,266 --> 00:38:34,465
他們不抓我
They're not after me okay,   

805
00:38:34,467 --> 00:38:36,667
待會見，看咋樣
we'll catch up later and see what happens.         

806
00:38:36,669 --> 00:38:38,168
現在你信了吧
So, you believe me now?     

807
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:41,304
是，我信你被撒旦邪教追捕
Yes, I believe you're being hunted by a Satanic cult.     

808
00:38:41,306 --> 00:38:42,905
走
Go.               

809
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:48,810
見過Neal嗎
Did you see Neal?        

810
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:51,913
上了個帝，派對女孩都想跟他上嗎
Jesus, is every girl at this party trying to get with him?   

811
00:38:51,915 --> 00:38:53,281
他在哪
Where is he?          

812
00:38:53,283 --> 00:38:54,415
嘿
Hi.               

813
00:38:54,417 --> 00:38:56,382
嗨
Hey.              

814
00:38:58,452 --> 00:39:02,420

815
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:03,487
Matt?              

816
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:09,625
天啊，嗨
Oh my god, hey!         

817
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:12,094
我想知道帥哥都跑哪了
You know, I was wondering where all the hot guys were.   

818
00:39:12,096 --> 00:39:14,196
你在這幹嘛
What are you doing here?    

819
00:39:18,768 --> 00:39:20,267

820
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:21,534
Matt，我們得跑
Matt, come on we have to go.  

821
00:39:21,536 --> 00:39:22,535
什麼
What?              

822
00:39:22,537 --> 00:39:24,370
我們得走，起來
We have to go, get up.     

823
00:39:24,372 --> 00:39:26,772
等一下，我牙齒貼滿嘔吐物
Wait, wait, wait, do I have puke in my teeth?           

824
00:39:26,774 --> 00:39:28,106
你朋友呢
Where's your friend?      

825
00:39:28,108 --> 00:39:28,840
誰
Who?              

826
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:30,541
Neal?              

827
00:39:30,543 --> 00:39:32,643
你們樓上看過了嗎
Uh, did you try upstairs?    

828
00:39:32,645 --> 00:39:34,378
嗯
Yeah.              

829
00:39:38,517 --> 00:39:41,451
我要坐一下
Oh, I've just got to sit for a sec.            

830
00:39:41,453 --> 00:39:42,385
噢！
Oooh!!!             

831
00:39:42,387 --> 00:39:43,319
歐
Ow.               

832
00:39:43,321 --> 00:39:44,353
老兄
Dude!              

833
00:39:44,355 --> 00:39:45,287
鑰匙
Oh, the keys.          

834
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:46,988
我們得走了
We've got to go man!      

835
00:39:46,990 --> 00:39:47,855
好的
Alright.            

836
00:39:47,857 --> 00:39:49,623
我有鑰匙
I've got the key.        

837
00:39:49,625 --> 00:39:51,791
你老笑容滿面
You're all smiling.       

838
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:57,696
等一下，你們去哪
Hey guys, wait, where are you going?       

839
00:39:57,698 --> 00:39:59,230
我們不是偷車
We're not stealing a car.    

840
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,498
是借
No, we're borrowing it.     

841
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:05,134

842
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,470

843
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:10,038
你夠了
That's it, that's it for you.  

844
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,206

845
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,478
這教會是普通型的還是?
Oh hey, so this church is it like any regular church or?    

846
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,013
正好相反
No, it's the exact opposite.  

847
00:40:21,015 --> 00:40:24,049
那個祭壇處男惹毛了你們神父？
Oh okay, so your altar boys molest your priests then?     

848
00:40:24,051 --> 00:40:26,117
我不太清楚
I don't really know.      

849
00:40:29,322 --> 00:40:30,187

850
00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:31,087
草，不好意思
Oh shit, sorry.         

851
00:40:31,089 --> 00:40:31,887

852
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:33,388
那邊
There.             

853
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:36,491
最好你來，你的屎你負責
You'd better drive, you've got to be responsible here.    

854
00:40:36,493 --> 00:40:39,026

855
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:40,560
啊
Ahhhh!!!!!!!          

856
00:40:40,562 --> 00:40:41,761
不會傷害你們的
We're not going to hurt you!  

857
00:40:41,763 --> 00:40:42,394
跑啊
Go! Go!             

858
00:40:42,396 --> 00:40:43,595
跑啊
Go! Go!             

859
00:40:43,597 --> 00:40:44,896
出來
Get out of the goddamn car!   

860
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:46,430
跑起
Go, go, go, go, go!       

861
00:40:46,432 --> 00:40:48,298
給力點
Come on!            

862
00:40:51,569 --> 00:40:53,268
你開車
Get the truck.         

863
00:40:54,337 --> 00:40:56,970
把她弄上車
Put her in the car!       

864
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,542

865
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,043
他們怎麼找上了
How the fuck did they find us?             

866
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:09,347
你那見利忘友的朋友出賣你了
I'll tell you how, your friend without benefits sold us out.   

867
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:10,614
Denise?             

868
00:41:10,616 --> 00:41:12,782
沒門，她還幫我逃呢
No fucking way man, she helped us escape dude.    

869
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,049
差點逃不了
Aw, barely.           

870
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:15,250
你知道你說什麼嗎
You don't know what you're talking about,          

871
00:41:15,252 --> 00:41:16,551
你爸如何
how about your dad?       

872
00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:18,119
員警？
The cop?            

873
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:19,954
給你五十塊，打賭他一定在你陰囊
I bet you 50 bucks he's got some
kind of tracking chip implanted 

874
00:41:19,956 --> 00:41:21,789
裝了跟蹤器
into your nut sack.       

875
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:24,525
這鎮上到處是撒旦教信徒
Listen, there are Satanists all over this town.        

876
00:41:24,527 --> 00:41:25,792
可以是任何人
It could be anyone, okay?    

877
00:41:25,794 --> 00:41:28,528
他媽的的士司機可能是
It could be you know the fucking taxi drivers,     

878
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:33,265
服務員，員警，無業流氓，他媽咖啡師
waitresses, cops, hobos,fucking baristas,         

879
00:41:33,267 --> 00:41:36,935
狗狗裝扮師，他媽的素食者，他媽的嬉皮士
dog groomers, fucking vegans,fucking hipsters man.       

880
00:41:36,937 --> 00:41:38,703
你說得對
You're right, you're right,   

881
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:40,371
要多加防範
we've got to keep our eyes peeled.         

882
00:41:40,373 --> 00:41:45,242
底線，我們可以信的只有雙方
Bottom line, the only people we 
can trust are each other, okay? 

883
00:41:45,244 --> 00:41:50,079
等一下，要是你撒謊呢
Wait, what if you just lied.  

884
00:41:50,081 --> 00:41:51,480
他們怎麼知道這些
How would they know?      

885
00:41:51,482 --> 00:41:53,949
他們會知道，我媽的線眼滿布
They will know, my mom is a bloodhound for bullshit.    

886
00:41:53,951 --> 00:41:56,117
這麼自尊心重的少年怎麼不會
What self respecting teenager doesn't know how to lie      

887
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,418
跟他媽撒謊
to his own mother?       

888
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:00,320
我一舉一動，她瞭若指掌
She can smell it on my breath. 

889
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:02,555
草
Oh fuck, oh fuck, fuck.     

890
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:03,822

891
00:42:03,824 --> 00:42:04,589
什麼？
What?              

892
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:05,423
草
Fuck!              

893
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:06,757
什麼
What?              

894
00:42:06,759 --> 00:42:08,558
什麼事
What's wrong?          

895
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,625
沒油
We're out of gas.        

896
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,231
或許撒旦信徒不會這麼大膽跟到這
Maybe the Satanists will be too scared to follow us here.   

897
00:42:27,609 --> 00:42:30,009
先付款再加油呢
It's one of those pre-paid deals.          

898
00:42:30,011 --> 00:42:32,077
我來
I got it.            

899
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:40,251
2號泵加50塊
Hi, fifty bucks on pump two.  

900
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:48,091
為了上帝，讓不潔流出你的雙眼
<i>Let the scales fall from your eyes</i>          

901
00:42:48,093 --> 00:42:54,630
是欺世盜名，撒旦才是救世主
<i> for  God  is  the  deceiver</i>   
<i>and  Satan  is  the  salvation.</i> 

902
00:42:54,632 --> 00:42:57,699
Sheldon跟我們說你的降生有特殊目的
<i>Sheldon  told  us you had  a  special  purpose.</i>

903
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:10,144
什麼
What?              

904
00:43:10,146 --> 00:43:12,212
我會給錢的
I'm going to pay for it.    

905
00:43:16,784 --> 00:43:19,651
老兄，這些什麼來的
Yo dude, what the fuck is all that?           

906
00:43:19,653 --> 00:43:22,186
儲糧，以便我們躲起來
Provisions, in case we have to go into hiding.        

907
00:43:22,188 --> 00:43:24,555
躲起來，這個
Yeah, hiding, about that.    

908
00:43:24,557 --> 00:43:27,057
我在想躲起來不是最好方法
I've been thinking hiding might not be the best idea,    

909
00:43:27,059 --> 00:43:27,991
我是說
I mean.             

910
00:43:27,993 --> 00:43:29,792
過來，上車
Okay, come on, get in the car.          

911
00:43:29,794 --> 00:43:31,360
不，這可能聽起來很荒謬
No, no, no this might sound a little fucked up        

912
00:43:31,362 --> 00:43:33,195
但要是這一切為真
but if any of this shit is real 

913
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:38,033
讓我去死正好能拯救世界
then getting me laid might actually save the world.     

914
00:43:40,137 --> 00:43:42,237
上車，趕腳
Get in the car,come on.             

915
00:43:42,239 --> 00:43:44,305
什麼？我認真的
What? I'm kind of serious.   

916
00:43:44,307 --> 00:43:46,073
我知道你認真，這就是
I know you're serious,that's why this is        

917
00:43:46,075 --> 00:43:47,474
你太他媽瘋了
so fucking insane man.     

918
00:43:47,476 --> 00:43:49,309
就如“誇大妄想症”一樣
That's like delusions of grandeur much?         

919
00:43:49,311 --> 00:43:50,810
他們要我死
They tried to kill me.     

920
00:43:50,812 --> 00:43:53,479
要是這真的，沒人安全，你懂吧
If this shit is real nobody is safe, you get that right?   

921
00:43:53,481 --> 00:43:55,380
老兄，世界沒地獄
Dude, there is no Hell.     

922
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,682
沒撒旦這些屎
There's no Satan or any of that shit.       

923
00:43:57,684 --> 00:44:00,518
你父母，我父母，Sheldon，Mary，
I mean, your parents, my parents, Sheldon, Mary,      

924
00:44:00,520 --> 00:44:02,486
都被洗腦成瘋瘋癲癲非正常人
they're all just brainwashed lunatics dude.          

925
00:44:02,488 --> 00:44:04,654
越早意識過來，你就越自由
The sooner you realize that the freer you'll be,       

926
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:07,390
看我，老兄
come on dude look at me.    

927
00:44:07,392 --> 00:44:10,092
我活在當下，痛快自在
I'm just living in the moment having a fucking blast      

928
00:44:10,094 --> 00:44:13,361
不只享受一種口味牛肉幹，是兩種
enjoying not one but two flavours of beef jerky.    

929
00:44:13,363 --> 00:44:17,164
沒大不了，因為到我死那天
It's no big deal because I know at the end of the day    

930
00:44:17,166 --> 00:44:20,600
只有我自己來評斷一生
the only asshole who is judging me is me.       

931
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:23,269
你知道我為何在這
You know why I'm here,right?              

932
00:44:23,271 --> 00:44:25,104
因為我是你唯一朋友
Because I'm your only friend.  

933
00:44:25,106 --> 00:44:27,506
對，因為我想分享你在第一時間
Yes, that and because I want to be there        

934
00:44:27,508 --> 00:44:33,211
嘗到陰道滋味後的喜悅
for the first moment that your dick tastes vaginal glory.    

935
00:44:33,213 --> 00:44:34,679
你想看我愛愛
You want to watch me have sex?               

936
00:44:34,681 --> 00:44:35,746
不是，老兄
No, no dude.          

937
00:44:35,748 --> 00:44:38,515
我只是想見到你開心
I just want to see you be happy.

938
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:40,350
少來
Come on, man.          

939
00:44:40,352 --> 00:44:42,118
開心
Be happy?            

940
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,754
你只想間接體驗我的生活，因為你沒有
You just want to live vicariously 
through me because you're not.           

941
00:44:45,756 --> 00:44:47,589
沒有什麼
Not what?            

942
00:44:47,591 --> 00:44:49,857
沒事了
Nothing.            

943
00:44:49,859 --> 00:44:51,091
沒關係，當我沒說過
Never mind, I didn't say that. 

944
00:44:51,093 --> 00:44:52,292
噢
Oh.               

945
00:44:52,294 --> 00:44:56,195
因為我配不上你嗎
Because I'm not cool enough for you?             

946
00:44:56,197 --> 00:44:59,364
因為我只是有樣學樣的朋友
Because I'm just your tag-a-long friend, right?          

947
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:00,932
現在你一朝成名
And now all of a sudden that you're Mr. Popular        

948
00:45:00,934 --> 00:45:03,601
不能忍受跟我這樣的失敗者做朋友
you can't hang out with a loser like me?       

949
00:45:03,603 --> 00:45:04,535
我這樣說過嗎
Did I say that?         

950
00:45:04,537 --> 00:45:05,802
拜託，Neal
Oh please, Neal.        

951
00:45:05,804 --> 00:45:06,702
跟我做朋友
Be my friend.          

952
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:08,571
這裡，給你牛肉幹
Here, take my jerky.      

953
00:45:08,573 --> 00:45:09,705
多少錢一晚
How much for a sleepover.    

954
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:10,872
你現在要混一下嗎
You want to hang out now?    

955
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:11,572
哈
Huh?              

956
00:45:11,574 --> 00:45:12,406
給你所有東西
Take everything.        

957
00:45:12,408 --> 00:45:13,140
住手
Stop.              

958
00:45:13,142 --> 00:45:13,740
我擁有的一切
Everything I have.       

959
00:45:13,742 --> 00:45:16,709
住手
Stop. Stop.           

960
00:45:16,711 --> 00:45:18,177
哇
Whoa.              

961
00:45:18,179 --> 00:45:19,344
什麼？
What?              

962
00:45:19,346 --> 00:45:21,813
不能想像，我會提議這個
I can't believe I'm even suggesting this.         

963
00:45:21,815 --> 00:45:23,881
什麼
What?              

964
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:25,949
叫雞
Prostitutes.          

965
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:28,884
叫雞
Prostitutes.          

966
00:45:28,886 --> 00:45:30,552
叫雞
Prostitutes.          

967
00:45:30,554 --> 00:45:32,420
叫雞
Prostitutes!          

968
00:45:32,422 --> 00:45:36,690
叫雞
Prostitutes!          

969
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,857
對啦
Fuck yeah.           

970
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:39,825
對啦
Fuck yeah man.         

971
00:45:45,665 --> 00:45:47,364
好的
Alright.            

972
00:45:47,366 --> 00:45:49,432
繼續找
Keep looking.          

973
00:45:52,103 --> 00:45:55,337
看來情況不太妙
It does not look good I'm afraid.            

974
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:57,539
他會現身的，Sheldon，信我
He'll show up Sheldon, trust me.             

975
00:45:57,541 --> 00:46:00,341
不必畏懼我，Gary
You don't have to fear me, Gary.               

976
00:46:00,343 --> 00:46:02,109
我站你那邊
I'm on your side.        

977
00:46:02,111 --> 00:46:06,613
但你要恐懼的，我們所有人恐懼的
But you need to fear,what we all need to fear,     

978
00:46:06,615 --> 00:46:08,448
是我腳下的大王
is our Lord below.       

979
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:13,352
我僅僅是他狂怒的執行者
I'm merely an instrument of his wrath.           

980
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:15,520
Sheldon要說的是
What Sheldon is trying to say is that -         

981
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,355
好了,Mary
Yes, Mary.           

982
00:46:17,357 --> 00:46:21,525
跟他們解釋一下我的話
Explain to them what I'm trying to say.        

983
00:46:21,527 --> 00:46:27,530
Sheldon是說要是Neal不出現
What Sheldon is trying to say is that if Neal doesn't show up 

984
00:46:27,532 --> 00:46:32,200
我們要找替代祭品
we're going to need to find some kind of replacement offering.   

985
00:46:32,202 --> 00:46:35,436
多謝澄清
Thank you for clarifying my dear.             

986
00:46:37,039 --> 00:46:39,506
噢
Oh.               

987
00:46:48,716 --> 00:46:50,282
太傷感了
Oh, this is sad.        

988
00:46:50,284 --> 00:46:52,550
我們該拯救而不是剝削她們
We should be helping these women not exploiting them.       

989
00:46:52,552 --> 00:46:56,120
這是你的主意
Hey, hey, hey, this was this was your idea.        

990
00:46:56,122 --> 00:46:59,256
我只想不要像之前悲劇就好
I know I just thought it would be less tragic somehow.   

991
00:46:59,258 --> 00:47:03,059
停一下
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.               

992
00:47:03,061 --> 00:47:06,896
要賺點真金白銀
Hey, you looking to make some real cash money       

993
00:47:06,898 --> 00:47:10,966
幫幫一對合法性欲旺盛男嗎
and get serviced by a couple of barely legal studs?        

994
00:47:14,737 --> 00:47:15,469
兩個都要
Both of you looking?      

995
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:16,403
不是
No.               

996
00:47:16,405 --> 00:47:17,904
是的
Yes, yes.            

997
00:47:17,906 --> 00:47:21,907
多少錢
How much?            

998
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:24,409
看你要什麼服務
That depends on what you want.             

999
00:47:24,411 --> 00:47:28,479
我只想今晚破處就夠
Uh, I just really need to lose my virginity tonight so.     

1000
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:41,189
嗯，我能幫你
Yeah, I can help you out.    

1001
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,424
但不是這裡
But not here.          

1002
00:47:43,426 --> 00:47:46,293
那邊找我，叫Ashley
Meet me there and ask for Ashley.            

1003
00:47:46,295 --> 00:47:48,561
噢
Oh.               

1004
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:01,973
就這裡？
Is this it?           

1005
00:48:01,975 --> 00:48:06,943
嗯
Yeah, yeah.           

1006
00:48:06,945 --> 00:48:10,446
有何能幫忙
Can I help you?         

1007
00:48:10,448 --> 00:48:13,615
這是妓院嗎
Is this the house of ill repute?            

1008
00:48:13,617 --> 00:48:15,850
不必低聲細語
You don't have to whisper.   

1009
00:48:15,852 --> 00:48:18,886
好的
Oh, oh okay.          

1010
00:48:18,888 --> 00:48:21,822
請上一個妓女
I'd like one prostitute please. 

1011
00:48:21,824 --> 00:48:22,823
好的
Alright.            

1012
00:48:22,825 --> 00:48:24,691
你們要找什麼類型呢
What were you looking for exactly?           

1013
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:26,826
我要好性格的
I'd like a good personality,  

1014
00:48:26,828 --> 00:48:31,062
我要笑得甜，有胸
I'd like a cute laugh,and boobs.            

1015
00:48:31,064 --> 00:48:32,229
他們都有胸
They all have boobs.      

1016
00:48:32,231 --> 00:48:33,897
我們要Ashley
We'll take Ashley.       

1017
00:48:33,899 --> 00:48:35,832
好的
Great.             

1018
00:48:35,834 --> 00:48:36,732
好的
Great.             

1019
00:48:36,734 --> 00:48:37,833
嗯
Yeah.              

1020
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:38,667
搞定
Go with that.          

1021
00:48:38,669 --> 00:48:39,534
好的
Great.             

1022
00:48:39,536 --> 00:48:41,435
請坐
Have a seat.          

1023
00:48:44,973 --> 00:48:47,039
這玩意紅眼睛的
The things have got red eyes.  

1024
00:48:54,581 --> 00:48:56,581
你跟我來
You come with me.        

1025
00:48:56,583 --> 00:48:57,248
你先坐著
You sit tight.         

1026
00:48:57,250 --> 00:48:57,881
噢
Oh.               

1027
00:48:57,883 --> 00:48:59,482
不不不
No, no, no, no.         

1028
00:48:59,484 --> 00:49:00,983
是這樣的
See, the thing like.      

1029
00:49:00,985 --> 00:49:02,884
你想做嗎
Do you want to do this?     

1030
00:49:02,886 --> 00:49:03,985
想
Yes.              

1031
00:49:03,987 --> 00:49:04,585
拜託
Please.             

1032
00:49:04,587 --> 00:49:05,986
是的，拜託
Yes, please.          

1033
00:49:05,988 --> 00:49:08,421
那麼他先
Then he goes first.       

1034
00:49:09,023 --> 00:49:09,821
Well.              

1035
00:49:09,823 --> 00:49:11,155
哇，啊
Whoa, ah.            

1036
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:12,022
等一下，Ashley
Wait, Ashley.          

1037
00:49:12,024 --> 00:49:14,024
呃，寶貝
Uh, baby.            

1038
00:49:14,026 --> 00:49:17,527
我等不及跟你翻雲覆雨
Look, I cannot wait to get with you             

1039
00:49:17,529 --> 00:49:20,530
很榮幸你也如此
and I'm so flattered that you feel the same way       

1040
00:49:20,532 --> 00:49:24,533
但他真該先做的
but he really should go first. 

1041
00:49:24,535 --> 00:49:27,602
沒錯
Yeah.              

1042
00:49:27,604 --> 00:49:29,670
我真需先做
I really need to go first.   

1043
00:49:33,842 --> 00:49:35,374
Matt?              

1044
00:49:35,376 --> 00:49:36,875
過來
Come on.            

1045
00:49:36,877 --> 00:49:38,776
Matt? Matt? Matt?        

1046
00:49:38,778 --> 00:49:39,843
搞不懂
I don't know, man.       

1047
00:49:55,427 --> 00:49:59,896
你想玩什麼
So, what's your deal?      

1048
00:49:59,898 --> 00:50:05,901
我想先來個手交
Well, I'm thinking I'd like to start off with a hand job   

1049
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:11,973
然後過渡到口交
and then you know work my way up to a blow job      

1050
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,242
再然後陰道交收尾
and then finish off with a vagina job?           

1051
00:50:15,244 --> 00:50:16,610
行
Okay.              

1052
00:50:16,612 --> 00:50:17,544
真的？
Yeah?              

1053
00:50:17,546 --> 00:50:19,445
很酷呢
Uh, cool.            

1054
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:22,915
給我外面朋友同樣套餐吧
And the same exact same goes for my friend out there.   

1055
00:50:22,917 --> 00:50:25,417
我要再三強調他的陰道交
I really can't stress enough how important it is        

1056
00:50:25,419 --> 00:50:28,987
要做得到位點
that he gets a proper vagina job.            

1057
00:50:28,989 --> 00:50:31,055
你身上有多少錢
Well, how much money do you got?            

1058
00:50:32,992 --> 00:50:35,058
對，現金
Yes, currency.         

1059
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:07,455

1060
00:51:07,457 --> 00:51:12,626
你怎麼入行從妓的？
So, how did you get into prostituting?        

1061
00:51:12,628 --> 00:51:17,664
我是說，你一定有些可歌可泣的故事
So, I mean you must have some wild stories.        

1062
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,198
沒什麼
Not really.           

1063
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,166
沒有？
No?               

1064
00:51:21,168 --> 00:51:25,603
我是說至少遇到瘋狂角色
You, I mean meet any crazy characters at least or?      

1065
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:27,371
我想有點
I guess.            

1066
00:51:27,373 --> 00:51:30,640
有什麼古怪花式
What's the weirdest thing    

1067
00:51:30,642 --> 00:51:33,943
嫖妓的叫你做呢
that anyone's ever asked you to do?         

1068
00:51:33,945 --> 00:51:36,445
有個給錢我在他狗身上拉屎
This one guy pays me to poop on his dog.            

1069
00:51:37,881 --> 00:51:39,080
噢
Oh.               

1070
00:51:42,351 --> 00:51:43,950
什麼狗
What kind of dog?        

1071
00:51:43,952 --> 00:51:46,018
不太清楚，棕色毛的吧
I don't know, a brown one.   

1072
00:51:50,857 --> 00:51:52,056
至少讓我看看你咪咪
Can I see your boobs at least?             

1073
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:54,958
噓
Shhhh!!!!!!!          

1074
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:58,527

1075
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:01,963

1076
00:52:01,965 --> 00:52:06,033
坦白說，這是我第一次
What if I told you this is my first time?         

1077
00:52:06,035 --> 00:52:07,901
那就拜託別哭
Please don't cry.        

1078
00:52:07,903 --> 00:52:11,004
射了，射了，射了
I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.             

1079
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,038
很好
Good.              

1080
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:17,109

1081
00:52:26,419 --> 00:52:28,552
嗚呼
Wooo-hooooo!!!!!!!!!      

1082
00:52:28,554 --> 00:52:29,386
彙報
And?              

1083
00:52:29,388 --> 00:52:30,520
怎麼啦
So, what happened?       

1084
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:31,254
跟我分享一下
Talk to me buddy.        

1085
00:52:31,256 --> 00:52:34,323
不能再快活
Oh man, was it awesome.     

1086
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:40,561
不只是愛愛棒棒的
Uh, I just, I mean not only was the sex amazing        

1087
00:52:40,563 --> 00:52:46,699
我想最美好部分是
but...but you know I think that the best part was         

1088
00:52:46,701 --> 00:52:49,835
Ashley跟我很投緣
that Ashley and I really connected you know.        

1089
00:52:49,837 --> 00:52:50,435
真的？
Really?             

1090
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:52,036
嗯
Yeah.              

1091
00:52:52,038 --> 00:52:53,237
哇
Wow.              

1092
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:53,870
哇
Wow.              

1093
00:52:53,872 --> 00:52:57,073
好的
Okay.              

1094
00:52:57,075 --> 00:52:58,741
那麼她在哪
So, where is she?        

1095
00:52:58,743 --> 00:52:59,608
Ashley?             

1096
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:01,409
可憐她，有氣沒力了
Oh, uh, poor thing is exhausted.

1097
00:53:01,411 --> 00:53:04,212
我真的給了她，但別擔心
You know I really gave it to her in there but don't worry   

1098
00:53:04,214 --> 00:53:06,681
我肯定她會撐得住下一個
you know I'm sure she's got another one in her        

1099
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:11,318
但別憤怒要是她心裡只有我
just don't be mad at me if she still has Matt on the mind. 

1100
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,119
我要做愛了

你要做愛了

You're not going to die, go in there do it.

準備好了

好好享受
Have a great time.       

1107

我就是個娘娘腔
I am a fucking pussy.      

1108
00:53:37,305 --> 00:53:39,138
Ashley...            

1109

嗨，輪到我了
Hey, it's my turn.

You just sit there, okay.    

1111

1114
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:32,217
Matt!              

1115

Matt!              

1116
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,887
Neal，我們談幾句
Hey Neal, we just need to talk to you for a minute.       

1117

we just need to talk to you for just a second.        

1119

你個蠢貨
Oh, you goddamn idiot.     

1135
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,252
Rod，他偷了我車

1136
00:55:51,254 --> 00:55:52,519
什麼

Greg，趕上
Greg, come on!         

1138
00:55:58,259 --> 00:55:59,691
草
Shit!              

1139
00:55:59,693 --> 00:56:01,159
我得為你拖著他們
Well, I have to hand it to you.              

1140
00:56:01,161 --> 00:56:03,528
你真勇回來找我
It's pretty brave of you to come back for me.       

1141
00:56:03,530 --> 00:56:04,929
你發什麼事啦
What happened to you?      

1142
00:56:04,931 --> 00:56:06,130
讓他們無法抽身
Just tried to keep them busy.  

1143
00:56:06,132 --> 00:56:07,965
為你騰出時間
Tried to buy you some time,   

1144
00:56:07,967 --> 00:56:10,367
Brad對我很和善
I did get pretty friendly with Brad.            

1145
00:56:10,369 --> 00:56:11,301
Denise，他是敵人呢
Denise, he's the enemy.     

1146
00:56:11,303 --> 00:56:12,302
拜託，Neal
For fucks sake, Neal.      

1147
00:56:12,304 --> 00:56:14,570
我開玩笑
I'm joking.           

1148
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:19,173
你永遠無法懂，是嗎
You're never going to get it，are you?             

1149
00:56:19,175 --> 00:56:20,507
懂什麼？
Get what?            

1150
00:56:20,509 --> 00:56:22,809
我喜歡你，你個蠢貨
That I like you, you moron.   

1151
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:25,011
我也喜歡你，但你不必這玩我
I like you too but you don't have to be a bitch about it.   

1152
00:56:25,013 --> 00:56:26,679
不是，Neal
No, Neal.            

1153
00:56:26,681 --> 00:56:29,548
草，我愛愛你
Fuck, I like like you.     

1154
00:56:29,550 --> 00:56:31,349
愛愛
Like like.           

1155
00:56:31,351 --> 00:56:34,452
什麼？為何
What? Why?           

1156
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:37,987
我不知道，因為你像是我認識的最酷的人
I don't know, because you're 
like the coolest person I've ever met?          

1157
00:56:37,989 --> 00:56:40,289
我不酷，Denise，我都不知道酷為何物
I'm not cool Denise, I don't even know how to be cool.     

1158
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:41,890
真的，Neal
Exactly, Neal.         

1159
00:56:41,892 --> 00:56:43,658
哦哇
Oh wow.             

1160
00:56:43,660 --> 00:56:46,127
太好了，這是說現在我們可以做愛了嗎
Awesome, does that mean we get to have sex now?      

1161
00:56:46,129 --> 00:56:47,061
不可以
No.               

1162
00:56:47,063 --> 00:56:48,362
做愛
Make love.           

1163
00:56:48,364 --> 00:56:49,629
你表現真的需要再好點
Okay, you really have to do better than that.         

1164
00:56:49,631 --> 00:56:51,497
你聞起來很好
You smell nice.         

1165
00:56:51,499 --> 00:56:52,831
不是這樣
No, Neal.            

1166
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:54,299
天啊，你要我說什麼
Jesus, what do you want me to say?              

1167
00:56:54,301 --> 00:56:56,567
我一向都喜歡你，但只停留在想
That I like you but I've always liked you but I thought. 

1168
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:58,569
就知道你就是他媽的個膽小鬼
I knew it, you're a fucking chicken.             

1169
00:56:58,571 --> 00:56:59,636
草
Fuck.              

1170
00:56:59,638 --> 00:57:00,503
好的
Okay.              

1171
00:57:00,505 --> 00:57:01,904
讓時光倒流
Lets just go back in time,   

1172
00:57:01,906 --> 00:57:04,239
假設我有勇氣叫你出來約會
pretend I had the guts to ask you out on a real date.      

1173
00:57:04,241 --> 00:57:05,573
約會
A date.             

1174
00:57:05,575 --> 00:57:07,641
好的，我們去哪
Okay, where are we going?    

1175
00:57:07,643 --> 00:57:09,376
是個驚喜，而你又同意了
It's a surprise but you say yes,         

1176
00:57:09,378 --> 00:57:13,380
我送你回家，加送一支紅玫瑰
I pick you up at your house with one perfect red rose     

1177
00:57:13,382 --> 00:57:15,715
我相當緊張，因為這晚
and I'm really nervous because this is the night     

1178
00:57:15,717 --> 00:57:17,883
我要跟你訴盡一切
I'm going to tell you everything

1179
00:57:17,885 --> 00:57:21,019
你也緊張，因為你知道接下來是什麼
and you're really nervous too   
because you know what's coming. 

1180
00:57:21,021 --> 00:57:22,987
好的，說多點
Alright, tell me more.     

1181
00:57:22,989 --> 00:57:27,490
先一起開卡丁車
We start with something fun like go-carting          

1182
00:57:27,492 --> 00:57:31,360
然後去那間高級素食餐館用餐
and after we walk down to that fancy vegan restaurant.   

1183
00:57:31,362 --> 00:57:33,362
有品味
Nice touch.           

1184
00:57:33,364 --> 00:57:35,497
餐後到海邊漫步
After dinner we walk by the beach             

1185
00:57:35,499 --> 00:57:37,332
然後我有了以前就該有的
and I gather every bit of courage I have       

1186
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:40,601
那些跟你說的勇氣
and tell you what I've always needed to.            

1187
00:57:42,338 --> 00:57:44,671
你要說什麼
What do you say?        

1188
00:57:44,673 --> 00:57:48,007
打從我情竇初開我就喜歡你
That I've liked you since I was old enough to like girls   

1189
00:57:48,009 --> 00:57:52,510
但我又害怕我對你表白了
but I was terrified that if I made a move on you       

1190
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:54,678
我怕會破壞了友情和搞砸了
I would ruin it and screw it up 

1191
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,280
然後你不再跟我說話
and you would never talk to me again.         

1192
00:58:06,424 --> 00:58:07,356
我的天
Oh boy.             

1193
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,958
坐穩
Hold on.            

1194
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:40,821
噢
Oh.               

1195
00:58:42,424 --> 00:58:43,556
你他媽逗我，Neal？
Are you fucking kidding me, Neal?               

1196
00:58:43,558 --> 00:58:44,823
噢
Ohhhh!!!!!!           

1197
00:58:44,825 --> 00:58:46,758
Neal，你真他媽逗我了
Neal, are you fucking kidding me?                

1198
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,825
幹我
Oh, fuck me.          

1199
00:58:47,827 --> 00:58:48,659
抱歉
Sorry.             

1200
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:50,727
天啊
Oh my god.           

1201
00:58:50,729 --> 00:58:52,495
Neal.              

1202
00:58:52,497 --> 00:58:53,496
給力點
Come on.            

1203
00:58:53,498 --> 00:58:56,832
抱歉，真的抱歉
I'm sorry, I'm just really sorry.           

1204
00:58:56,834 --> 00:58:58,600
搞砸了
It's a mess.          

1205
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:00,668
Denise，我真的...
Denise, I really...       

1206
00:59:04,439 --> 00:59:05,504
搞什麼
What the?            

1207
00:59:07,474 --> 00:59:08,406
老兄
Dude.              

1208
00:59:08,408 --> 00:59:10,908
滲透了沒
Was there penetration?     

1209
00:59:10,910 --> 00:59:12,475
多得不得了
A bunch.            

1210
00:59:14,979 --> 00:59:17,479
真的？跟我說說感覺
Really, so tell me what it felt like.           

1211
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:19,080
就是幹的感覺
Like a fucking.         

1212
00:59:19,082 --> 00:59:24,618
襪子套腳，正合腳的感覺
Put a sock on a foot man and it fits just right.      

1213
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:25,752
他還沒破處
He's still a virgin.      

1214
00:59:25,754 --> 00:59:27,787
走
Lets go, lets go.        

1215
00:59:27,789 --> 00:59:28,420
走
Lets go.            

1216
00:59:28,422 --> 00:59:29,521
太抱歉了
I'm so sorry.          

1217
00:59:29,523 --> 00:59:30,588
沒事的
It's okay.           

1218
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:31,956
明天打給我
Call me tomorrow.        

1219
00:59:31,958 --> 00:59:32,823
我會的
I will.             

1220
00:59:32,825 --> 00:59:34,624
你成功達陣了嗎
Did you, did you get it in?   

1221
00:59:34,626 --> 00:59:36,225
你搞上她了嗎
Did you get it in her?     

1222
00:59:45,702 --> 00:59:48,502
發生什麼事
So? What happened?       

1223
00:59:48,504 --> 00:59:49,603
要說些話嗎
Are you going to say anything?             

1224
00:59:49,605 --> 00:59:51,137
要跟我說說發生什麼了嗎
Are you going to tell me what happened?          

1225
00:59:51,139 --> 00:59:51,804
好的，發生什麼事
Alright, what happened.     

1226
00:59:51,806 --> 00:59:52,604
好的
Okay.              

1227
00:59:52,606 --> 00:59:54,839
我跟Denise說我喜歡她
I told Denise I liked her,   

1228
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:57,508
她說也愛我
she said she liked me back which was great          

1229
00:59:57,510 --> 01:00:00,477
這很好嘛，我搞到她腿上
and then I came all over her fucking leg.         

1230
01:00:00,479 --> 01:00:02,545
開心吧
Happy?             

1231
01:00:02,547 --> 01:00:05,614
太棒了，你本可以早幾年跟她說
That's awesome dude, shit if   
you would have told her sooner  

1232
01:00:05,616 --> 01:00:08,550
你就不必如守身如玉這麼辛苦
you could have been breaking your oath all over the place.   

1233
01:00:08,552 --> 01:00:10,351
我們就不會淪落如此田地
We wouldn't even be here.    

1234
01:00:10,353 --> 01:00:12,286
這樣說是我錯，Matt？
Oh, so this is my fault now Matt?               

1235
01:00:12,288 --> 01:00:12,886
什麼
What?              

1236
01:00:12,888 --> 01:00:13,519
不是
No.               

1237
01:00:13,521 --> 01:00:14,386
不不不
No, no, no, no.         

1238
01:00:14,388 --> 01:00:15,620
我只是說說
I'm just saying.        

1239
01:00:15,622 --> 01:00:16,721
你只是說說
Oh, you're just saying.     

1240
01:00:16,723 --> 01:00:19,390
很好，你只是說說
Good, okay good you're just saying.           

1241
01:00:19,392 --> 01:00:22,459
我要說說的是
Ah, okay well what I'm saying  

1242
01:00:22,461 --> 01:00:25,528
你今晚反客為主成主角了
is that you've made this whole night about you.         

1243
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:27,663
今晚本該是我上床的
I was the one who was supposed to get laid tonight,       

1244
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:31,500
你插腳進來，成全了你的破處之旅
you got in line and you were the one who had sex.   

1245
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:34,135
對，我跟壞妓女搞上了，行了吧
Yeah, I had sex with a dirty hoe okay,             

1246
01:00:34,137 --> 01:00:36,237
你跟Denise那個才特別
what you have with Denise that's special,          

1247
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:37,905
那個才棒
that's that's nice.       

1248
01:00:37,907 --> 01:00:39,406
草你
Fuck you, man.         

1249
01:00:39,408 --> 01:00:40,840
草我
Fuck me?            

1250
01:00:40,842 --> 01:00:43,375
太遲了，不再有我跟Denise故事了
It's too late, there's no more me and Denise, dude.     

1251
01:00:43,377 --> 01:00:44,642
我回不了學校
I'm not going to school again,dude,               

1252
01:00:44,644 --> 01:00:46,377
我死翹翹了
I'm dead like fucking dead.   

1253
01:00:46,379 --> 01:00:47,544
死翹翹
Dead, dead, dead.        

1254
01:00:47,546 --> 01:00:49,546
你還沒死，好不
You're not dead yet okay,    

1255
01:00:49,548 --> 01:00:51,915
你還，我們還能逃出生天
you still，we can still get out of here          

1256
01:00:51,917 --> 01:00:53,349
別為此怪責我
and don't blame me for this.  

1257
01:00:53,351 --> 01:00:55,584
我怎跑，手都綁死了
How am I going to get out, my hands are fucking tied.    

1258
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:56,518
我手綁上了
My hands are tied!       

1259
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,587
我手也綁緊了
My hands are tied too.     

1260
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,723
你踢我？
Did you just kick me?      

1261
01:01:07,462 --> 01:01:08,461
你他媽的踢我？
Did you just fucking kick me?             

1262
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:09,962
對，我他媽的踢你
Yeah I fucking kicked you.   

1263
01:01:09,964 --> 01:01:10,929
你做什麼
What are you doing, man?    

1264
01:01:10,931 --> 01:01:11,963
你他媽先踢我的
You fucking kicked me first.  

1265
01:01:11,965 --> 01:01:13,764
知道你踢我很痛啊
When you kicked me it fucking hurt.         

1266
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:14,865
後面他媽的安靜點
<i> Hey, shut the fuck up back there.</i>              

1267
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:17,000
你給我閉嘴
No, you shut the fuck up man.               

1268
01:01:17,002 --> 01:01:19,302
草你
Fuck you, man.         

1269
01:01:19,304 --> 01:01:20,303
草
Fuck.              

1270
01:01:20,305 --> 01:01:23,306

1271
01:01:23,308 --> 01:01:24,573
他媽想走嗎
Want to fucking go?       

1272
01:01:31,281 --> 01:01:32,680
別
Don't even.           

1273
01:01:32,682 --> 01:01:35,816
回來啦
Ah, there you are.       

1274
01:01:35,818 --> 01:01:40,153
你本不該這麼多麻煩的
You are more trouble than you're worth.        

1275
01:01:40,155 --> 01:01:43,222
而你老讓我們等
And you have kept us waiting.  

1276
01:01:43,224 --> 01:01:45,023
我已對你再三寬容了，Neal
Well, I've got to hand it to you Neal,           

1277
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:49,493
而你一而再讓家族蒙羞
you continually find new ways to humiliate your family.     

1278
01:01:49,495 --> 01:01:52,295
我蒙羞，真的，父親？
I'm the embarrassment,really Dad, me?          

1279
01:01:52,297 --> 01:01:53,062
我蒙羞？
I'm the embarrassment?     

1280
01:01:53,064 --> 01:01:55,531
沒錯，小鬼
Yeah, that's right buster.   

1281
01:01:55,533 --> 01:01:58,734
這個死蠢宗教快把你腦洗沒了
This stupid religion has fucked with your heads so bad   

1282
01:01:58,736 --> 01:02:00,335
你真的願意犧牲
you're actually willing to sacrifice           

1283
01:02:00,337 --> 01:02:01,636
把你的親生骨肉
your own flesh and blood    

1284
01:02:01,638 --> 01:02:04,005
給有尾巴的紅魔鬼呢
for some red guy with a tail.           

1285
01:02:04,007 --> 01:02:06,007
哇哇哇，你頭腦不清醒
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that's where you go easy.     

1286
01:02:06,009 --> 01:02:08,476
你崇拜一具他媽的哈佬喂服裝邪人
You worship a fucking Halloween costume.        

1287
01:02:08,478 --> 01:02:09,410
對
Yeah.              

1288
01:02:09,412 --> 01:02:10,911
閉嘴
Shut up.            

1289
01:02:10,913 --> 01:02:13,914
你把媽也拖進去，看看她
You dragged Mom down with you, look at her,      

1290
01:02:13,916 --> 01:02:16,249
她覺得你對嗎
does she look okay to you?   

1291
01:02:16,251 --> 01:02:19,685
我不是蒙羞的人
I'm not the embarrassment.   

1292
01:02:19,687 --> 01:02:22,320
多麼的甜言能辨
How very sweet.         

1293
01:02:22,322 --> 01:02:29,526
是希望有更多時間做感人家庭團聚，但我們沒有
I wish we had more time for such touching 
family reunions but alas we do not.     

1294
01:02:29,528 --> 01:02:31,694
讓他們準備一下
Get them ready.         

1295
01:02:31,696 --> 01:02:34,596
一切會好的,Neal
Everything is going to be okay,Neal.             

1296
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:44,671

1297
01:02:54,749 --> 01:02:58,750
太好了，太他媽的妙
Real nice, real fucking nice.  

1298
01:02:58,752 --> 01:03:00,551
你親兒子？
Your own son?          

1299
01:03:00,553 --> 01:03:02,352
你這沒膽的
You're gutless.         

1300
01:03:14,899 --> 01:03:18,700
Neal.              

1301
01:03:18,702 --> 01:03:20,702
振作，Neal
Come on, Neal.         

1302
01:03:20,704 --> 01:03:22,770
別跟我說話
Don't talk to me.        

1303
01:03:34,883 --> 01:03:38,551
我哭
I cried.            

1304
01:03:38,553 --> 01:03:40,986
什麼
What?              

1305
01:03:40,988 --> 01:03:43,321
我哭了
I cried.            

1306
01:03:43,323 --> 01:03:44,655
你要說什麼
What are you saying?      

1307
01:03:44,657 --> 01:03:45,622
你哭個屁啊
What do you mean you cried?   

1308
01:03:45,624 --> 01:03:47,090
你想說什麼
What are you talking about?   

1309
01:03:47,092 --> 01:03:50,559
今晚我被妓女破處失身，傷感的淚
I lost my virginity to a prostitute tonight and I cried. 

1310
01:03:50,561 --> 01:03:54,295

1311
01:03:54,297 --> 01:03:58,732
對，沒錯
Yeah, alright.         

1312
01:03:58,734 --> 01:04:02,268
都不知道怎發生的，就這樣失身了
I don't know what happened man, I just lost it.       

1313
01:04:02,270 --> 01:04:04,837
我搞上了，但我不清楚
I mean, I had it but then I don't know       

1314
01:04:04,839 --> 01:04:09,941
有東西夾住，然後就失了
something just snapped and I just.            

1315
01:04:09,943 --> 01:04:11,943
至少你不會到了她腿
Well, at least you didn't come on her leg.            

1316
01:04:11,945 --> 01:04:13,444
在右腿上？
Right on the leg?        

1317
01:04:13,446 --> 01:04:14,978
腿上，座椅上
The leg, the seat.       

1318
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,046
太他媽難看
It's fucking embarrassing.   

1319
01:04:19,283 --> 01:04:21,249
過來，過來
Come here man, come here.    

1320
01:04:21,251 --> 01:04:23,184
對不起，老兄
I'm sorry dude,I'm sorry man.          

1321
01:04:23,186 --> 01:04:24,785
過來，過來
Come here, come here man.    

1322
01:04:24,787 --> 01:04:26,787
抱歉，這晚真的太糟糕了
I'm sorry man, this whole night has been so fucked up dude.    

1323
01:04:26,789 --> 01:04:29,856
不
No, no, no.           

1324
01:04:29,858 --> 01:04:31,824
是美好的
This is nice.          

1325
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,892
我要這個
I needed this.         

1326
01:04:36,763 --> 01:04:39,463
就這樣
Well, this is it buddy.     

1327
01:04:39,465 --> 01:04:44,167
等一下，還有另外的方法逃脫
Wait, there still might be a way out of this.        

1328
01:04:44,169 --> 01:04:45,201
沒了
No, there isn't.        

1329
01:04:45,203 --> 01:04:46,669
不，停
No, no, no, stop.        

1330
01:04:46,671 --> 01:04:48,971
別平靜接受這一切
Just stop being so at peace with everything okay       

1331
01:04:48,973 --> 01:04:50,772
聽我說，聽我說
just listen to me here, hear me out okay         

1332
01:04:50,774 --> 01:04:54,142
我不會放棄你的
I'm not going to give up on you.

1333
01:04:54,144 --> 01:04:57,011
男人怎樣算是破處？
When does a guys virginity really end, right?        

1334
01:04:57,013 --> 01:05:01,682
當他勃起的陰莖穿透物體
It's when he penetrates something with his erect penis. 

1335
01:05:01,684 --> 01:05:03,817
對
Right.             

1336
01:05:03,819 --> 01:05:06,052
誰說一定要陰道
Who says it has to be a vagina.             

1337
01:05:06,054 --> 01:05:07,319

1338
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,887
天啊，不
Oh god no.           

1339
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:14,058
別，跟你說這會幫你逃命
No, no, no, I'm telling you dude
if it's going to save your life 

1340
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:15,159
你得幹我
you've got to do me.      

1341
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:16,660
我不能
I can't, I can't.        

1342
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:18,028
你得
You have to.          

1343
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,662
你是說你不能幹你好友
Are you saying that you couldn't fuck your best friend       

1344
01:05:19,664 --> 01:05:20,796
救自己一命嗎
to save your own life?     

1345
01:05:20,798 --> 01:05:21,997
你要這樣說嘛
Is that what you're saying?   

1346
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:23,631
我不肯定“裝備”匹配
I'm just not sure the equipment would work.            

1347
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:26,800
太傷人的話了，我至少是8尺寸的
Be totally mean right now okay, just, I'm at least an 8.     

1348
01:05:26,802 --> 01:05:27,901
即使你的是10
Even if you were a 10.     

1349
01:05:27,903 --> 01:05:31,237
我只是說有多難呢
I'm just saying how hard could it be?           

1350
01:05:37,077 --> 01:05:37,809
給我喘口氣
Give me a sec.         

1351
01:05:37,811 --> 01:05:41,411
好的，集中
Okay, yeah, just think.     

1352
01:05:41,413 --> 01:05:42,044
好的，我試一下
Okay, I'll try.         

1353
01:05:42,046 --> 01:05:43,245
什麼？
What?              

1354
01:05:43,247 --> 01:05:44,512
真的嗎？
I mean, really?         

1355
01:05:44,514 --> 01:05:45,145
對
Yeah.              

1356
01:05:45,147 --> 01:05:46,012
好的
Okay, yeah.           

1357
01:05:46,014 --> 01:05:46,912
我想好好活
I mean, I want to live right.  

1358
01:05:46,914 --> 01:05:49,147
我要你活呢
Yeah, I want you to live man.           

1359
01:05:51,518 --> 01:05:53,251
哇哇，你幹嘛
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?            

1360
01:05:53,253 --> 01:05:54,085
那是什麼
What was that?         

1361
01:05:54,087 --> 01:05:55,352
抱歉，我想或許
Sorry, I thought maybe.     

1362
01:05:55,354 --> 01:05:56,686
沒前戲了，沒時間了
No extras man, no time.             

1363
01:05:56,688 --> 01:05:57,653
沒時間前戲
No time for extras.       

1364
01:05:57,655 --> 01:05:59,054
儘管，儘管上就好
Lets just, we've just got to go.              

1365
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:00,088
我們怎開始
How do we start?        

1366
01:06:00,090 --> 01:06:03,991
呃，過來
Uh, uh, come here.       

1367
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:11,097
好的，你懂的
Just, just alright, you know.  

1368
01:06:11,099 --> 01:06:13,566
草，天啊
Oh fuck, oh my god.       

1369
01:06:13,568 --> 01:06:16,535
你是我好友
You're my best friend, man, you're my best friend.      

1370
01:06:16,537 --> 01:06:18,837
好友
Best friend.          

1371
01:06:23,910 --> 01:06:25,910
我們要怎麼處置她
So, what are we going to do with her?          

1372
01:06:25,912 --> 01:06:27,378
你在這，看著她
You stay here and watch her.  

1373
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:29,546
不，我要看祭典呢
But no, I want to watch the sacrifice you said that.   

1374
01:06:29,548 --> 01:06:31,681
夠了，Bradley
That's enough Bradley.     

1375
01:06:34,185 --> 01:06:35,918
天啊
Oh my god.           

1376
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:38,020
她當你小孩一樣說話
She talks to you like you're a child.       

1377
01:06:38,022 --> 01:06:40,922
我不准給你說話了
I am not allowed to talk to you anymore.          

1378
01:06:40,924 --> 01:06:43,024
少來，Brad
Come on Brad.          

1379
01:06:43,026 --> 01:06:47,627
你聰明，性感
You're this smart, sexy guy   

1380
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:51,863
手臂粗壯，胸肌發達
and with your arms and abs, this chest        

1381
01:06:51,865 --> 01:06:57,034
是女孩都想跟你搭嘴
I mean girls must be hitting on you all the time.       

1382
01:06:57,036 --> 01:06:59,469
在這教會還真難找單身女人
It is hard to find single women in this church.          

1383
01:06:59,471 --> 01:07:03,238
單身女人怎樣可以成為
Well, as a single woman how would I go about becoming     

1384
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:05,273
教會成員
part of the church?       

1385
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:06,874
你得宣誓放棄上帝，搞個紋身
You've got to renounce God,get a tattoo,           

1386
01:07:06,876 --> 01:07:08,976
對著聖經唾?
take a whiz on a bible.     

1387
01:07:08,978 --> 01:07:12,145
就這一切
It's a whole thing.       

1388
01:07:12,147 --> 01:07:13,880
要是你想去看
You know, if you really want to go out there          

1389
01:07:13,882 --> 01:07:16,048
你去就好了
you should just go.       

1390
01:07:16,050 --> 01:07:17,949
我想，但我得在這
Yeah, I know I just can't because I have to stay here    

1391
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:22,453
看著你
and babysit you.        

1392
01:07:22,455 --> 01:07:24,321
我想我沒事
I think I'll be fine.      

1393
01:07:35,267 --> 01:07:36,499
你後面搞什麼飛機
What's going on back there?   

1394
01:07:36,501 --> 01:07:37,800
硬不起來
I'm not hard.          

1395
01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:40,569
恕我無能，我不會幫你吹的

跳過念名字

你說什麼？

Lord, we offer this virgin flesh unto you          

1436
01:09:23,153 --> 01:09:27,488

that you may draw strength from the blood of innocence.   

1437
01:09:30,526 --> 01:09:33,860
