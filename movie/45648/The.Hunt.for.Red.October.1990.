后来她叫我们

给斯坦利买个弟弟

00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:59,630
他把潜艇当作私人音乐厅
{\rEng}He figures this whole boat is basically just his own personal, private stereo set.

我相信是巨兽出笼了

00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,590
我知道他是上层人物
{\rEng}I know he descends from aristocracy...

我要去一个地方  你不能同行
{\rEng}Where I am going, you can not follow.

166
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,370
彼得罗夫医生  立刻来舰长室
{\rEng}Dr Petrov, report to my cabin immediately.

167
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,200
这里发生了意外

168

00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,250
Listen to me. There's no cradle underneath it. Get it over。
{\rEng}下面没有支船架  快点动手

170

171
00:20:29,390 --> 00:20:33,010
瑞恩  谁让你进来的?
{\rEng}Ryan! Who let you in here?

172
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:37,640
他们叫你来砌模型?
{\rEng}Have they got you playing with models now?

173
00:20:37,810 --> 00:20:43,520
该死的  叫他慢下来
{\rEng}Damn it, Phil! Tell them to slow down.

174
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:49,110
这不是模型  这是深潜救助艇
{\rEng}It's not a model. It's a DSRV. Rescue sub.

175
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,740
我知道这是什么  我原来见过一艘
{\rEng}I know what it is. And I just need to see one before.

176
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,200
你拿它来做什么?
{\rEng}What are you doing with it?

177
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:55,410
改装入坞设计
{\rEng}Ah, well, we're rigging it with a generic docking collar...

178
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,460
它可以配合各国潜艇
{\rEng}so it'll mate with British, German... just about anybody's sub.

179
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,920
在24小时内赶到世界每个角落
{\rEng}We can get it anywhere in the world in 24 hours.

180
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:09,550
- 你的背没事吧?  - 没事  有没有时间?
{\rEng}- How's your back?  - It's fine. Have you got a minute?

181
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:15,680
比常规的台风级潜艇更大  这些是什么门?
{\rEng}It's bigger than a regular Typhoon. What are these doors?

182
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:18,600
你真细心
{\rEng}You don't miss much, do you?

183
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:22,860
它们比鱼雷发射管大
{\rEng}Those are too big to be torpedo tubes.

184
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,090
用来发射洲际弹道导弹?
{\rEng}Can you launch an ICBM horizontally?

185
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:27,150
是的  你想问什么?
{\rEng}Sure. Why would you want to?

186
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:32,870
它们是对称的  排在舰轴两边
{\rEng}They're symmetrical, right down the long axis of the sub.

187
00:21:33,030 --> 00:21:35,700
拖曳线阵列声纳呢?
{\rEng}How about a towed sonar array?

188
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,370
肯定不是  太靠近螺旋桨了
{\rEng}Nope. Too close to the screws.

189
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:41,670
怎么会...
{\rEng}I'll be...

190
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,750
这可能是履带
{\rEng}This could be a caterpillar.

191
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,480
什么?
{\rEng}A what?

192
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:50,050
履带驱动  磁性压水式推进器
{\rEng}Uh, a caterpillar drive. Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

193
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:52,510
- 明白吗?  - 不明白
{\rEng}- Do you follow?  - No.

194
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:57,140
它就像水中的喷射引擎
{\rEng}It's like a jet engine for the water.

195
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,790
靠向后的反冲推进
{\rEng}Goes in the front, gets squirted out the back.

196
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:02,270
没有运动部件  所以非常的安静
{\rEng}Only it's got no moving parts, so it's very, very quiet.

197
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,000
有多安静?
{\rEng}Like how quiet?

198
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,570
我们的声纳绝对发现不了它
{\rEng}It's doubtful our sonar would even pick it up.

199
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,300
听起来像是鲸鱼游动
{\rEng}And if it did, it would sound like whales humping...

200
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,860
或是地壳震动
{\rEng}or a seismic anomaly.

201
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,990
一点也不像潜艇
{\rEng}Anything but a submarine.

202
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,620
我们数年前研制这种潜艇
{\rEng}We messed with this a couple of years ago.

203
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:21,080
但未成功
{\rEng}Couldn't make it work.

204
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:23,100
他们成功了?
{\rEng}They really built this?

205
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,940
这不是个模型吧?
{\rEng}This isn't a mock-up or anything.

206
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,790
它今早出海了
{\rEng}She put to sea this morning.

207
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:37,220
十二岁时  我帮爸爸建造防空洞
{\rEng}When I was twelve, I helped my daddy build a bomb shelter in our basement...

208
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:43,480
因为有人打算向佛罗里达州发射导弹
{\rEng}because some fool parked a dozen warheads 90 miles off the coast of Florida.

209
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:47,940
这东西能向华盛顿和纽约  发射二百枚导弹
{\rEng}This thing could park 200 warheads off Washington or New York...

210
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:54,280
而且神不知鬼不觉
{\rEng}and no one would know anything about it until it was all over.

211
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,290
- 舰长  你没事吧?  - 没事
{\rEng}- Are you all right, Captain?  - Oh, yes.

212
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,010
被地上的茶水滑了一跤  竟然断送生命
{\rEng}It's just to die for something as petty as slipping on tea.

213
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,380
你不必自责  舰长  这是个意外
{\rEng}You're blaming yourself, Captain. It was an accident.

214
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,590
回基地后你的心情自然会平复
{\rEng}You'll feel better when we put in.

215
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,220
- 平复?  - 嗯  回基地后  舰长
{\rEng}- Put in?  - Well, to base, Captain.

216
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:22,170
我们不能没有政治委员
{\rEng}We cannot go on without a political officer.

217
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,350
医生  这是艘苏联战舰
{\rEng}Doctor, this is a combat vessel of the Soviet Navy.

218
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:28,670
而我是个资深舰长
{\rEng}And I'm a senior combat officer.

219
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:33,400
我们不能为这意外撤销任务
{\rEng}We do not cancel operations because of accidents.

220
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:39,160
水兵  过来  过来
{\rEng}Seaman, come here. Come here.

221
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:44,620
- 你叫什么名字?  - 副厨师洛吉诺夫
{\rEng}- Your name?  - Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.

222
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,630
好  你和医生来当见证人
{\rEng}Good. I want you and the doctor to witness this.

223
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:52,070
我要解除政治委员的导弹钥匙
{\rEng}I'm removing the Political Officer's missile key carry on...

224
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,340
并由我来保管
{\rEng}and I'm keeping it by myself.

225
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:59,180
舰长  我认为这得请示红旗舰队总司令
{\rEng}Captain, I think we should report this to Red Fleet Command.

226
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,160
这恐怕不行  医生
{\rEng}I'm afraid that's impossible, Doctor.

227
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:04,980
我们必须保持无线电静默
{\rEng}Our orders are for strict radio silence.

228
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:10,360
- 你可以走了  - 这样不太好  舰长
{\rEng}- That's all, Loginov.  - This is most unnerving, Captain.

229
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:14,380
发出两条钥匙
{\rEng}The reason for having two missile keys...

230
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:18,240
就是为了避免...
{\rEng}is so that no one man may...

231
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:23,580
- 避免什么?  - 避免一人控制导弹
{\rEng}- May what?  - May arm the missiles.

232
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,950
也许我应该控制钥匙
{\rEng}Perhaps I should keep the key.

233
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:28,170
谢谢你  医生  你可以走了
{\rEng}Thank you. That'll be all, Doctor.

234
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:34,000
我将会发布指令  到时候你就会明白
{\rEng}When I address the crew, then you will understand.

235
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:44,350
彼得罗夫  我不会向中央报告你的言论
{\rEng}Petrov, I will try to forget your comments when I present my report.

236
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,680
谢谢  舰长
{\rEng}Thank you, sir.

237
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:58,450
在方位310  速度12节  距离20000码
{\rEng}Holding steady on 310. 12 knots at about 20,000 yards.

238
00:24:58,610 --> 00:25:03,660
- 有没有资料?  - 电脑正在分析
{\rEng}- Have you got a make on it?  - The computer is chewing on it, sir.

239
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:07,120
双螺旋桨  像是台风级潜艇
{\rEng}Twin screws. The plant noise sounds like a typhoon.

240
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:17,000
是艘新型潜艇  舰长
{\rEng}I'd say we got a new boat, sir.

241
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:20,130
汤姆  最近几天总部有没有新消息?
{\rEng}Tommy, I miss something on the boards last few days?

242
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:23,050
没有新的潜艇记录
{\rEng}Sub plant hasn't said anything about it.

243
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:30,270
- 电脑记录了多少台风级潜艇?  - 6艘
{\rEng}- All right. How many Typhoons are listed?  - Six, sir.

244
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,480

245
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,520
靠近点开始监听
{\rEng}Start a tape on him. See if we can work in a little closer.

246
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,570
遵命  长官
{\rEng}Yes, sir.

247
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:41,410
它会听到我们吗?
{\rEng}Won't he hear us?

248
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,660
潜艇有听觉盲点  博蒙特
{\rEng}Not if we stay in his baffles, Seaman Beaumont.

249
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:48,790
他们听不见螺旋桨背后的声音
{\rEng}Come in behind his propeller and he's deaf as a post.

250
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,460
声纳有新发现吗?
{\rEng}Any sonar contacts, Mr.Kamarov?

251
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,700
没有新发现  舰长
{\rEng}No contacts, Captain. The sonar is clear.

252
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,030
海面有没有发现船只  鲍罗丁?
{\rEng}Good. Do we have any surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?

253
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,200
没有任何目标
{\rEng}No contacts, sir. Scope is clear.

254
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:32,830
好  我要向船员说明任务
{\rEng}Good. Then it's time I explain our orders to the crew.

255
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,290
同志们  我是舰长
{\rEng}Comrades, this is your captain.

256
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:40,590
我感到很荣幸
{\rEng}It is an honor to speak to you today...

257
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:43,280
我们驾驶祖国最先进的潜艇
{\rEng}and I'm honored to be sailing with you on the maiden voyage...

258
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,800
作首次航行
{\rEng}of our motherland's most recent achievement.

259
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:50,890
我们将再玩一个危险游戏
{\rEng}And once more, we play our dangerous game.

260
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:56,860
跟我们的老对手美国海军  一较高下
{\rEng}A game of chess, against our old adversary the American Navy.

261
00:26:57,020 --> 00:27:00,630
四十年来  你们的父亲和兄长
{\rEng}For 40 years, your fathers before you...

262
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:04,240
一直跟他们周旋
{\rEng}and your older brothers played this game and played it well.

263
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:09,790
但现在情况转变了  我们占有优势
{\rEng}But today the game is different. We have the advantage.

264
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:14,120
我想起我们昔日的人造地球卫星和尤里·加加林
{\rEng}It reminds me of the heady days of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin.

265
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:17,710
我们的火箭令世界震惊
{\rEng}when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets.

266
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,380
我们的无声潜艇  也会令世界震惊
{\rEng}It will tremble again at the sound of our silence.

267
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,630
- 命令:以无声推进系统潜航  - 是  舰长
{\rEng}- The order is: Engage the silent drive.  - Aye, sir.

268
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,640
- 水柜控制  开启外门  - 外门开启
{\rEng}- Ballast control, open outer doors.  - Yes, open outer doors.

269
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:33,100
潜水官  关闭主引擎  使用履带推进
{\rEng}Diving command. Engage caterpillar and secure main engines.

270
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,820
正在开门  舰长
{\rEng}Doors opening, Captain.

271
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:43,990
同志们  我们的舰队也不知道我们的威力
{\rEng}Comrades, our own fleet doesn't know our full potential.

272
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,950
他们想尽一切办法测试我们
{\rEng}They will do everything possible to test us,

273
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:49,680
他们最终只会自惭形秽
{\rEng}but they will only test their own embarrassment.

274
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,240
我们将撇下其他舰只
{\rEng}We will leave our fleet behind.

275
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:56,920
无声无息地穿过美国舰队的巡逻  穿过他们的声纳网
{\rEng}We will pass through the American patrols pass their sonar nets...

276
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,210
进入各大城市  一边听美国摇滚乐
{\rEng}and lay off their largest city and listen to their rock 'n' roll...

277
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,470
一边进行导弹演习
{\rEng}while we conduct missile drills.

278
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:12,720
他们最终只会听到我们的笑声
{\rEng}When we are finished the only sound they will hear is our laughter.

279
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:19,360
然后我们驶到哈瓦那迎接阳光和友谊
{\rEng}while we sail to Havana where the sun is warm and so is the comradeship.

280
00:28:20,650 --> 00:28:22,830
冷却系统已经启动
{\rEng}Cryogenic plant coming on line, Captain.

281
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:27,200
同志们  今天是大日子  我们缔造历史
{\rEng}A great day, comrades. We sail into history.

282
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:37,410
启动履带式推进器
{\rEng}Caterpillar engaging.

283
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,960
履带式推进器已启动  舰长
{\rEng}Caterpillar engaging, Captain.

284
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:58,100
- 发生了什么事?  - 不知道
{\rEng}- What happened?  - I don't know.

285
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,510
左满舵
{\rEng}Full rudder left.

286
00:29:27,670 --> 00:29:31,720
领航员  新航向: 250度
{\rEng}Navigator, new course: 250.

287
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:35,100
好的  新航向: 250
{\rEng}Yes. New course: 250.

288
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:11,930
声纳发现目标  左舷不远处
{\rEng}Sonar contact, Captain. Port quarter. Close aboard.

289
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:16,310
- 美国洛杉矶级潜艇  - 美国潜艇! 舰长  我们...
{\rEng}- American, Los Angeles class.  - American! Captain, we...

290
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,770
航向: 310
{\rEng}Course: 310.

291
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:23,650
美军在跟踪我们?
{\rEng}Is the American turning to follow us?

292
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:27,360
不是  他们保持原来的航向
{\rEng}No, Captain. The American is continuing in his original course.

293
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,780
- 他们继续驶向西北方  - 他们听不多我们
{\rEng}- He is continuing north-west.  - He can't hear us.

294
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:35,280
会不会听见歌声?
{\rEng}And the singing?

295
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:51,090
让他们唱吧
{\rEng}Let them sing.

296
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,840
你说什么? 检查仪器
{\rEng}What are you talking about? Check your gear.

297
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,820
正在运行诊断程序  舰长
{\rEng}Running diagnostics now, Captain.

298
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,790
声纳工作正常  苏联人消失了
{\rEng}The sonar is working, Captain. The Russian disappeared.

299
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:27,380
听到1分钟  位于坚守4000码外  然后就消失了
{\rEng}One minute he was steady, 4,000 yards off the bow then he was gone.

300
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:33,550
- 我好像听到...  - 听到什么?
{\rEng}- And for a second, I thought I heard...  - Heard what?

301
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,050
我好像听到歌声
{\rEng}I thought I heard singing, sir.

302
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,930
- 歌声?  - 是的
{\rEng}- Singing?  - Yes, sir.

303
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,490
早上好  长官
{\rEng}Good morning, sir.

304
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:00,530
早上好  长官
{\rEng}Good morning, sir.

305
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:05,210
早上好  长官
{\rEng}Good morning, sir.

306
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,300
早上好  长官  昨晚睡得好吗
{\rEng}Good morning, sir. I hope you had a lovely evening.

307
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:16,840
今早有点冷
{\rEng}A little chilly this morning.

308
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:44,370
马尔科·雷米斯寄了封信来
{\rEng}There's a letter from Marko Ramius.

309
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,910
马尔科!
{\rEng}Ah, Marko!

310
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:20,240
喂
{\rEng}Yes?

311
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:24,080
我是瑞恩博士
{\rEng}No, this is Dr Ryan.

312
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:30,290
- 发生什么事了?  - 不再是学术研究那么简单
{\rEng}- What the hell happened?  - This is no longer research project.

313
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,070
我找到了那些门的资料
{\rEng}I got a line on those doors.

314
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:40,840
你知道它们是什么吗?
{\rEng}You know what they are?

315
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:49,060
- 无声推进系统  - 你怎么知道的?
{\rEng}- A nearly silent propulsion system.  - How did you know that?

316
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:51,710
我们的潜艇曾经发现它
{\rEng}The captain of the sub following her radioed in.

317
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:54,310
但它消失了
{\rEng}Thing disappeared right in front of him.

318
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,230
这还不止  看看吧
{\rEng}And that's only the half of it. Read.

319
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:10,580
- 有证件吗?  - 真是难以置信
{\rEng}- Got your ID?  - My god, this is unbelievable.

320
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,340
基洛夫级  斯维尔德洛夫级  基辅级  明斯克级
{\rEng}The Kirov, three Sverdlovs, the Kiev, the Minsk.

321
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,020
他们出动了整支舰队
{\rEng}They've sortied their whole bloody fleet.

322
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,550
看来是这样的
{\rEng}That's about the size of it.

323
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:26,010
- 我们去哪里?  - 向杰弗里汇报情况
{\rEng}- Where are we going anyway?  - Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt.

324
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,430
他是国防顾问
{\rEng}The President's Security Advisor.

325
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,690
大部分参谋长都来了
{\rEng}Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there, along with a few other people.

326
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:37,110
- 谁作汇报?  - 你
{\rEng}- Who is giving the briefing?  - You are.

327
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:39,900
文员已经给你准备好了幻灯片
{\rEng}The yeoman will have all the slides laid out for you.

328
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:42,530
你只需...
{\rEng}So all you've got to do...

329
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:52,080
没有人比你更了解这件事
{\rEng}Look, no one understands this material better than you.

330
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:57,170
结合现有的资料  向他介绍这艘潜艇
{\rEng}Just give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand.

331
00:34:57,340 --> 00:35:01,760
他会单刀直入地发问  你实话实说
{\rEng}He's liable to ask some direct questions. Give him direct answers.

332
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:05,840
谈谈你的想法
{\rEng}Tell him what you think. Come on.

333
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,960
先生们  在过去二十四小时
{\rEng}Uh, gentlmen. The last 24 hours...

334
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,440
苏联海军有不寻常的举动
{\rEng}have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity.

335
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:22,490
这艘初次启航的潜艇被命名为"红十月号"
{\rEng}The first to sail was this ship we believe called the Red October...

336
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:26,240
为了纪念1917年十月革命
{\rEng}in reference to the October revolution of 1917.

337
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:30,040
它是台风级潜艇的变体  有650英尺长
{\rEng}A variant of the Typhoon class, she's 650 feet long

338
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,830
排水量是三万二千吨
{\rEng}and 32,000 tons submerged displacement.

339
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,460
跟二次大战的航空母舰相等
{\rEng}Roughly the same size as a World War II aircraft carrier.

340
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:39,880
舰首和舰尾的这些门后面...
{\rEng}We believe that these doors here on the bow...

341
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:43,880
...是独特的推进系统
{\rEng}...and again on the stern enclose a unique propulsion system.

342
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:47,550
磁性压水式推进器  又名履带式推进器
{\rEng}A magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar...

343
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:51,600
所以潜艇可以无声无息地航行
{\rEng}that would enable the sub to run virtually silent.

344
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:54,580
舰长是最受敬重的
{\rEng}It is possible that this new drive system allowed the captain...

345
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,400
资深指挥官  他叫雷米斯...
{\rEng}a man named Ramius, their senior and perhaps most respected commander.

346
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,570
有没有他的照片?
{\rEng}Do we have his picture available?

347
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:03,590
它可以避开战舰的追踪
{\rEng}Allowed Ramius to elude one of our attack boats...

348
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:06,450
达拉斯号今早尝试跟踪红十月号
{\rEng}the Dallas, which trailed Red October from harbor this morning.

349
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:13,120
如果这推进器真的能无声运作
{\rEng}It is also possible that this drive system, if operable could render...

350
00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:18,330
红十月号就可以无视大西洋的警戒网
{\rEng}the Red October undetectable to our Sosus warning nets in the Atlantic.

351
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:23,710
这潜艇会不会是"先发制人武器"
{\rEng}Mr.Ryan. Would you characterize this as a first-strike weapon?

352
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,090
有这个可能
{\rEng}Uh, that is a possibility, sir.

353
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:33,710
它可以偷偷地接近对手
{\rEng}It is designed to approach by stealth and to shower its target with multiple...

354
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:35,930
发射核弹头
{\rEng}independent warheads with little or no warning before impact.

355
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:39,770
它是用来开战的
{\rEng}Goddamn thing was made to start a war.

356
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,440
说下去  瑞恩先生
{\rEng}Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

357
00:36:42,610 --> 00:36:44,510
红十月号突然失踪
{\rEng}About the same time the Dallas lost contact...

358
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:46,400
与此同时
{\rEng}there were additional sailings.

359
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:52,280
波利尼湾列宁格勒和地中海出动舰只
{\rEng}From Polijarny and from Leningrad on the Baltic and from the Mediterranean.

360
00:36:52,450 --> 00:36:57,580
58艘核潜艇正驶向大西洋
{\rEng}There are now some 58 nuclear submarines headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

361
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,270
今天下午
{\rEng}This afternoon's satellite pass over...

362
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,800
卫星发现波利尼湾的战舰发出热能
{\rEng}Polijarny found heat blooms in the engineering plants...

363
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,570
表明  基洛夫级  明斯克级
{\rEng}at the Kirov, the Minsk and...

364
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,180
和其它20艘巡洋舰和驱逐舰即将出海
{\rEng}more than 20 other cruisers and destroyers, indicating they were preparing to sail.

365
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,840
苏联海面舰队大举出动
{\rEng}This constitutes the bulk of the Soviet surface fleet.

366
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:13,350
格里尔上将  你有什么结论
{\rEng}Admiral Greer, your conclusions.

367
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:17,850
现在没有足够的资料来作出结论
{\rEng}Well, sir, the data support no conclusions as yet.

368
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,990
太平洋没有军舰
{\rEng}The absence of activity in the Pacific...

369
00:37:19,990 --> 00:37:21,960
他们可能只是演习
{\rEng}suggests this could be just an exercise.

370
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:25,900
可能不是演习
{\rEng}Suppose it's not an exercise?

371
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:30,110
他们可能想挑战北约
{\rEng}Suppose this is the beginning of a move against NATO?

372
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:35,010
我还有些非常敏感的信息
{\rEng}NSA can speak for that, Mr. Pelt. I must emphasize the extreme sensitivity...

373
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:37,370
绝对不能公开
{\rEng}of this information and that it not leave the room.

374
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,770
在启航前
{\rEng}Before sailing...

375
00:37:39,770 --> 00:37:42,000
雷米斯去信给巴度宁上将
{\rEng}Captain Ramius sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin.

376
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:45,750
他是红旗舰队指挥部的主席
{\rEng}Chairman of the Red Fleet northern political directorate.

377
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,130
她的叔叔
{\rEng}That's her uncle.

378
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:50,340
- 谁的叔叔?  - 雷米斯妻子的叔叔
{\rEng}- Whose uncle?  - Ramius' wife.

379
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:53,680
巴度宁是她叔叔
{\rEng}Padorin is her uncle.

380
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:56,200
信的内容还不清楚
{\rEng}Now, the contents of the letter are unknown

381
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,890
但是巴度宁立刻和查宁戈总理开会
{\rEng}but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded a meeting with Premier Chernenko...

382
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:07,190
数分钟后  苏联海军开始追寻红十月号
{\rEng}and within minutes of that meeting the Soviet fleet sailed with orders to...

383
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,990
目的是击沉它
{\rEng}find Red October and sink her.

384
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:15,410
- 击沉它?  - 他们要对付的是一个疯子
{\rEng}- Sink her?  - My God. They've got a madman on their hands.

385
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:20,710
如果它驶入海岸范围五百英里  我们只有两分钟时间作准备
{\rEng}Within 500 miles off the coast, we'll have only two minutes' warning.

386
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,510
- 今天是23号  是吧?  - 什么?
{\rEng}- Today's the 23rd, isn't it?  - What?

387
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,930
- 今天是23号吗?  - 是的
{\rEng}- Is today the 23rd?  - Yeah.

388
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,280
你个XX的!
{\rEng}You son of a bitch.

389
00:38:54,450 --> 00:38:58,040
你个XX的!
{\rEng}You son of a bitch!

390
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,080
你有什么高见  瑞恩博士?
{\rEng}You wish to add something to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

391
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:15,470
我们可以考虑另一种可能性
{\rEng}I was just thinking that perhaps there's another possibility we might consider.

392
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,260
雷米斯可能想叛变
{\rEng}Ramius might be trying to defect.

393
00:39:19,430 --> 00:39:22,890
- 那么你的建议是?  - 说下去
{\rEng}- Do you mean to suggest that this man has come...  - Proceed. Mr. Ryan.

394
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:31,070
雷米斯负责训练军官
{\rEng}Look. Ramius trained most of their officer corps...

395
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,700
他可以挑选忠于自己的下属
{\rEng}which would put him in a position to select men willing to help him.

396
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:39,280
他不是俄国人  他生于立陶宛
{\rEng}He's not Russian. He's Lithuanian by birth...

397
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,290
由当渔夫的祖父带大
{\rEng}raised by his paternal grandfather, a fisherman.

398
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:48,000
他没有孩子  没有家累
{\rEng}And he has no children. No ties to leave behind.

399
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:54,170
今天是他妻子首个忌日
{\rEng}And today is the first anniversary of his wife's death.

400
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,410
别瞎猜  你只是个分析员  你怎么知道?
{\rEng}Oh. Come on. You're just an analyst. How can you read his mind?

401
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,470
我认识雷米斯
{\rEng}I know Ramius, General.

402
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,970
他是潜艇舰队的传奇人物
{\rEng}He's nearly a legend in the submarine community.

403
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:05,310
他敢于挑战政党
{\rEng}He's been a maverick his entire career.

404
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,810
我在外交宴会见过他
{\rEng}I actually met him once at an embassy dinner.

405
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:10,150
将军  你认识雷米斯吗?
{\rEng}Have you ever met Captain Ramius, General?

406
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,250
霍利斯上将
{\rEng}Admiral Hollis

407
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:26,250
雷米斯何时到达导弹发射地点?
{\rEng}how long before Ramius could be in a position to fire his missiles at us?

408
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:31,300
- 四天后  - 好的  我会向总统汇报
{\rEng}- Four days.  - All right, I'll brief the President.

409
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:37,220
瑞恩博士  请留步
{\rEng}Dr Ryan, would you stay for a moment, please?

410
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:41,600
我叫你实话实说  但这次...
{\rEng}I said speak your mind, Jack, but Jesus...

411
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:56,650
你令将军难以下台
{\rEng}You slammed the door on the general pretty hard, Jack.

412
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:00,370
- 我无意冒犯他  - 这我知道
{\rEng}- That was not my intention, sir.  - Oh, yes, it was.

413
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,350
他当众奚落你  然后你回击他
{\rEng}He was patronizing you, and you stomped on him.

414
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:06,160
我认为他应有此报
{\rEng}In my opinion, he deserved it.

415
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:11,420
我是政客  政客会说谎使诈
{\rEng}Listen, I'm a politician, which means I'm a cheat and a liar...

416
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:15,130
这一刻在吻婴孩  转过脸就抢棒棒糖
{\rEng}and when I'm not kissing babies, I'm stealing their lollipops.

417
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,300
但政客会灵活地听取意见
{\rEng}But it also means that I keep my options open.

418
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:26,060
现在假设你说得对
{\rEng}So let's assume for a minute that you're right...

419
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:32,820
这个苏联人想叛变  我们该做什么?
{\rEng}and this Russian intends to defect. What do you suggest we do about it?

420
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,820
- 我们夺取潜艇  - 等等
{\rEng}- We definitely grab the boat, sir.  - Hey, wait a minute.

421
00:41:38,990 --> 00:41:42,240
这不是一个迷途的米格战机飞行员
{\rEng}We're not talking about some stray pilot with a M.I.G.

422
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:47,370
我们谈论的是价值数十亿美元的苏联国家财产
{\rEng}We're talking about several billion dollars worth of Soviet state property.

423
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:50,020
苏联肯定会追回的
{\rEng}They're going to want it back.

424
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:52,500
派人登上潜艇调查他们
{\rEng}Maybe it's enough then just to get some people on board and inspect it.

425
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,760
编个借口... 进行"海岸例行检查"
{\rEng}Call it whatever you want to... a Coastguard safety inspection.

426
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,300
从何着手?
{\rEng}So how do we proceed?

427
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:04,260
通知大西洋舰队的指挥官
{\rEng}First, we need to contact the commanders in the Atlantic directly.

428
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:06,720
如果苏军窥听到我们的命令
{\rEng}The Russians get one whiff of this through...

429
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:09,020
这游戏就结束了
{\rEng}the regular communications circuits, the game is up.

430
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:12,230
我们要制定策略帮助他们
{\rEng}Secondly, we figure out how we can help them.

431
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,030
准备随时介入  调停这场风波
{\rEng}We need to devise a plan to intercede, ready to go at a moment's notice.

432
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,880
最后  派人接触雷米斯
{\rEng}The third, somebody's got to go make contact with Ramius...

433
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:22,570
找出他的动机
{\rEng}and find out what his intentions really are.

434
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,830
好  你何时出发?
{\rEng}Okay, when do you leave?

435
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,910
等等
{\rEng}Wait a minute!

436
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,170
将军说得对  我只是局外人  我是个分析员而已
{\rEng}The general was right. I am not field personnel. I am only an analyst.

437
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,460
你是最佳人选  我不能差遣他们
{\rEng}You're perfect. I can't ask any of these characters to go.

438
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:42,220
第一  他们不会相信  他们不会凭直觉行事
{\rEng}One, they don't believe them. Two, they wouldn't stake their reputations on a hunch...

439
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,760
- 而你...  - 可以被牺牲
{\rEng}- where as you...  - Are expendable.

440
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,810
差不多
{\rEng}Something like that.

441
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:56,520
在三天之内证实你的理论
{\rEng}I'll give you three days to prove your theory correct.

442
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:03,280
否则我们要消灭雷米斯  明白吗
{\rEng}After that, I have to hunt down Ramius and destroy him. Will you do it?

443
00:43:20,090 --> 00:43:22,220
岂有此理
{\rEng}Mother of God!

444
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,640
双引擎三分之二全速前进
{\rEng}Secure the masts. All ahead two thirds. Set depth to 900 meters.

445
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:30,890
- 发生什么事了?  - 关闭舱盖  三分之二速度下潜
{\rEng}- What is it? What's happened?  - Mast secured, helm at 2/3.

446
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:36,190
左转至方位205
{\rEng}Come left, heading 205.

447
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:53,710
命令是七小时前发布的  呆在底下
{\rEng}These orders are seven bloody hours old! Sitting on the bottom.

448
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:57,080
像个头脑混乱的小孩
{\rEng}Like an addled schoolboy.

449
00:43:57,250 --> 00:44:00,880
- 舰长  - 超速前进
{\rEng}- Captain?  - All ahead flank.

450
00:44:01,050 --> 00:44:06,220
问下工程师反应堆能否推动至105%
{\rEng}Inquire of the engineer about going to 105% on the reactor.

451
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:12,310
七小时了  整支舰队在追捕他
{\rEng}Seven hours! The entire fleet is after him.

452
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,780
到达900米深
{\rEng}Leveling at 900 meters.

453
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:29,580
舰长  工程师说反应堆可推动至105%  但不建议这样
{\rEng}Captain, Engineer reports 105% on the reactor is possible... but not recommended.

454
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:43,300
推动至百分之一百零五
{\rEng}Go to 105 on the reactor.

455
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:51,720
- 什么事? 我们去哪里?  - 去杀一个朋友
{\rEng}- Captain, what is it? Where are we going?  - We're going to kill a friend.

456
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,190
我们去杀雷米斯
{\rEng}We're going to kill Ramius.

457
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:20,830
从没在舰上喝过这么难喝的罗宋汤
{\rEng}If you like borscht, perhaps, but I've eaten better in an oiler's galley.

458
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,300
我太太对待应说  这厨子在阿富汗学烹饪?
{\rEng}My wife asked the waiter, "Where did this man learn to cook, Afghanistan?"

459
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:30,890
然后我们去看芭蕾舞  去看那位像吉赛尔的新舞者
{\rEng}So then we went on to the Bolshoi, the ballet, to see this new girl as Giselle.

460
00:45:31,050 --> 00:45:35,560
那位新舞蹈员真是漂亮  她嫁给工厂经理...
{\rEng}You remember how beautiful she was. She just married a factory manager.

461
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:42,310
医生  有没有最新的辐射测验数据
{\rEng}Excuse me, Doctor. Do you have the figures for the latest batch of radiation tests?

462
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:44,860
现在要?
{\rEng}Now?

463
00:45:45,030 --> 00:45:48,200
是的
{\rEng}Now.

464
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:54,160
上一次测验的数据也拿来吧  作个对比
{\rEng}Perhaps you could bring the preceding set as well... for comparison.

465
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,200
谢谢你  医生
{\rEng}Thank you, Doctor.

466
00:46:13,890 --> 00:46:17,180
他不会这么快回来
{\rEng}It will take him some time.

467
00:46:18,390 --> 00:46:23,270
在开始前  我想了解普金的死因
{\rEng}Before we begin, Captain. I'd like to know exactly what happened to Putin.

468
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:35,450
- 他不是真的滑倒吧  - 我不喜欢你这样的语气
{\rEng}- He didn't slip on his tea, did he?  - I don't think I like your tone, Slavin.

469
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:38,020
我们在这儿
{\rEng}What the hell's my tone got to do with it?

470
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:40,430
身处险境
{\rEng}We're risking our lives here.

471
00:46:40,430 --> 00:46:42,830
普金会带来麻烦
{\rEng}Putin could have made complications.

472
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,050
你以为他会袖手旁观  成全我们?
{\rEng}Did you think he would go away and sulk while we carried out our plans?

473
00:46:47,210 --> 00:46:50,510
他被谋杀?
{\rEng}Are you saying he was murdered?

474
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:53,800
- 老天  - 别发牢骚
{\rEng}- My God.  - Stop whining, Yuri.

475
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:57,850
他就是被谋杀的  他是个混蛋
{\rEng}So he was murdered. I have no problem with that. The man was a pig.

476
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:02,190
- 但我们应该一起做决定  - 你不是指挥官
{\rEng}- But it is a decision we should have all made together.  - You are not in command here.

477
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:07,400
如果真相败露  船员会叛变
{\rEng}If the crew finds out, we could have a mutiny.

478
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:10,570
艇上每一件事都会影响我们
{\rEng}Everything that happens on this ship affects us all.

479
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:13,570
纠察长已经起了疑心
{\rEng}The Master-At-Arms is already suspicious.

480
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:19,370
- 现在还可以回去...  - 绝不能回头
{\rEng}- We could still go back.  - There'll be no going back.

481
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:25,380
启航前  我给巴度宁上将寄了封信
{\rEng}Before we sailed, I dispatched a letter to Admiral Padorin...

482
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:29,920
我在信内宣布了叛变计划
{\rEng}in which I announced our intention to defect.

483
00:47:31,670 --> 00:47:35,090
我的天  为什么?
{\rEng}In the name of God, why?

484
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:39,930
到达新世界后  科特兹烧掉所有船
{\rEng}When he reached the new world, Cortez burned his ships.

485
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:45,600
- 手下只好跟他一起奋斗  - 你把我们置之死地
{\rEng}- As a result, his men were well motivated.  - You have signed our death warrants.

486
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:51,440
- 巴多宁上将会派整支舰队来  - 他们会追捕我们
{\rEng}- Padorin will send the entire fleet.  - Jesus! They'll find us.

487
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:56,280
没有人会来找我们  住口吧
{\rEng}Nobody is going to find us. That's enough, Yuri.

488
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:01,950
把潜艇交给美国是不够的
{\rEng}You had to do it, huh? You couldn't just turn the submarine over to the Americans.

489
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,870
你还要发表政治宣言
{\rEng}You had to make a political statement.

490
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:12,760
背后隐藏着什么心态? 为何不能静静地溜走?
{\rEng}Or was it something deeper, Captain? Something that made you unable to slip away?

491
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:19,430
- 是虚荣心作祟吧?  - 我们为着不同的原因叛变  维克多
{\rEng}- Was it ego, Captain?  - We each have our reasons, Victor.

492
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:24,230
收到这潜艇的蓝图后  我开始思变
{\rEng}My own began the day I was handed the blueprints for this ship.

493
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:29,020
这潜艇本来只有一个用途  我改变它的用途...
{\rEng}A ship which had but one use. And as for the rest...

494
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:33,740
我会负上全责
{\rEng}well, those are things that I alone must carry the burden for.

495
00:48:34,950 --> 00:48:40,530
安纳托利  你害怕我们的舰队  你应该害怕
{\rEng}Anatoly, you're afraid of our fleet. Well, you should be.

496
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:45,870
我相信  我们有三分一的胜算
{\rEng}Personally, I give us... one chance in three.

497
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:53,210
要茶吗?
{\rEng}More tea, anyone?

498
00:48:54,470 --> 00:48:57,300
不要了?
{\rEng}No?

499
00:48:57,470 --> 00:49:00,800
你们可以回岗位了
{\rEng}Then you may report back to your posts.

500
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:20,620
听到舰长的命令吧  散会
{\rEng}You heard the captain, dismissed.

501
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,540
舰长
{\rEng}Captain.

502
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:48,270
我不会在他们面前反驳你
{\rEng}Captain, I would never disagree with you in front of the men, you know that.

503
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,150
但这次维克多说得对
{\rEng}But in this case Victor was right.

504
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:57,280
- 不通知莫斯科会比较好  - 瓦西里
{\rEng}- It would have been better if you had not informed to Moscow.  - Oh, Vasily.

505
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,030
莫斯科不足为患  苏联海军也不难对付
{\rEng}Moscow is not the worry, nor the whole Soviet Navy.

506
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:08,830
我了解他们的战略  我有优势
{\rEng}I know their tactics. I have the advantage.

507
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:15,420
美国人才叫人担心
{\rEng}The worry is the Americans.

508
00:50:15,590 --> 00:50:20,880
遇上适当的对手才会成功
{\rEng}If we meet the right sort, this will work.

509
00:50:22,970 --> 00:50:27,600
如果对方性急鲁莽...
{\rEng}We get some buckaroo...

510
00:50:31,560 --> 00:50:36,360
有乱流  你不喜欢坐飞机?
{\rEng}Some turbulence. You don't like flying?

511
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:40,740
这不算是什么  5个月前的乱流那才厉害
{\rEng}This is nothing. You should have been here five months ago.

512
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:45,620
呕吐更是不在话下  我们在日本海遇上雹暴
{\rEng}Talk about puke! We ran into a hail storm over the Sea of Japan, Right?

513
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:50,330
机师吐在挡风玻璃上
{\rEng}The pilot shot his lunch all over the windshield...

514
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,170
我往无线电吐
{\rEng}and I barfed on the radio.

515
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:56,320
一切倾囊而出
{\rEng}Knocked it out completely, and it wasn't that...

516
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,300
那是次重量级呕吐
{\rEng}lightweight stuff either! It was that chunky, industrial-weight puke!

517
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,890
要不要吃一点?
{\rEng}You want a bite?

518
00:51:03,050 --> 00:51:06,390
下次我会把你的高见记在备忘录中
{\rEng}Next time you get a bright idea, just put it in a memo.

519
00:51:15,730 --> 00:51:20,400
- 长官  - 你可以走了  中尉
{\rEng}- Sir.  - That will be all, Lieutenant. Thank you.

520
00:51:20,570 --> 00:51:25,530
- 鹰眼那班机怎么样了?  - 遇上了强风
{\rEng}- That hawkeye from Weymouth Trap?  - Four wire. Caught a gust over the fantail.

521
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,910
- 那还不算太差  - 这位先生想见你
{\rEng}- Not bad considering.  - The gentleman is here to see you.

522
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,170
查理  你说什么?
{\rEng}The gentleman? What the hell are you talking about, Charlie?

523
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:38,210
司令说  穿军服才不会惹人注意
{\rEng}I apologize for the uniform, sir. This is Admiral Greer's idea of a low profile.

524
00:51:38,380 --> 00:51:41,610
- 你是司令的下属?  - 是的  长官
{\rEng}- You work for Jim Greer?  - That's all right, sir.

525
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,840
告诉我  到底发生了什么事
{\rEng}Then I imagine you'll tell me what all the hubbub's about.

526
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:52,640
舰长  你有时间吗?  有个东西你应该去看看
{\rEng}Captain, you got a minute? Jonesy's got something I think you ought to see.

527
00:51:53,940 --> 00:51:59,190
- 你去喝点咖啡  叫他们给我送茶来  - 好的  舰长
{\rEng}- Martinez, get yourself a cup of coffee. Send me up some tea.  - Aye, Captain.

528
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:02,650
舰长要一杯茶
{\rEng}Messenger, get the captain a cup of tea.

529
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:12,000
台风七号消失后  我听到歌声...
{\rEng}Captain. Sir, the moment that sub went silent and I thought I heard singing...

530
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,540
我听到很微弱的背景声
{\rEng}I heard something in the background, real faint.

531
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,920
等其它潜艇离开后  我录下这些声音
{\rEng}After all those subs took off, I caught it again and got it on tape.

532
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:24,050
用电脑过滤声带  剩下这声音
{\rEng}I washed it through the computer and was able to isolate this sound.

533
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:32,220
电脑认为  这是"岩浆移位"的声音
{\rEng}The computer identified it as magma displacement.

534
00:52:32,390 --> 00:52:37,440
这套软件本来是用来探测地震的
{\rEng}The SAPS software was originally written to look for seismic events.

535
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,440
所以  它用地震来解释陌生的音调
{\rEng}When it gets confused, it runs home to momma.

536
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:44,610
- 我不知道你想说什么  - 对不起
{\rEng}- I'm not following you.  - Sir, I'm sorry.

537
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:47,780
以十倍速度再听听
{\rEng}Listen to it at ten times speed.

538
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:59,500
- 这一定是人为的声音  - 对
{\rEng}- Now, that's got to be manmade, Captain.  - All right.

539
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:06,220
首次发现目标是9时15分  方位269
{\rEng}The first contact was at 09:15 and the bearing was 269.

540
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:09,050
9时30分的时候  它在这里
{\rEng}At 09:30, it was here.

541
00:53:09,050 --> 00:53:11,720
在11时和11时15分又在这两点发现它
{\rEng}I came back to it at 11:00 and 11:15, here and here.

542
00:53:11,890 --> 00:53:14,750
苏联潜艇可以高速驶过
{\rEng}Remember the dispatch we got about Russian sub skippers running...

543
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,600
雷克雅内斯海脊
{\rEng}the Reykjanes Ridge at high speeds...

544
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,500
因为他们掌握了海底悬崖的地势
{\rEng}because they had hyper-accurate surveys of the underwater canyons...

545
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,230
他们有"红航线一号"
{\rEng}Yeah, Red Route One.

546
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,240
- 海底悬崖的入口是托尔双峰  - 是的
{\rEng}The front door to those canyons was a formation called Thor's Twins, Right?

547
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,740
看看这个
{\rEng}Look at that.

548
00:53:43,670 --> 00:53:46,380
- 直驱"红航线一号"  - 舰长
{\rEng}- Right into Red Route One.  - Captain.

549
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:50,260
我可能疯了  但我打赌
{\rEng}You may think I'm crazy, but I'll bet that...

550
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:53,970
这是艘新型苏联潜艇
{\rEng}magma displacement was actually some new Russian sub...

551
00:53:54,140 --> 00:53:58,230
它驶向冰岛海岸
{\rEng}and it's headed for the Iceland coast.

552
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,670
恕我直言  钟斯
{\rEng}Have I got this straight, Jonesy?

553
00:54:01,670 --> 00:54:04,940
你不信任价值四千万的电脑说是地震
{\rEng}A $40 million computer tells you you're chasing an earthquake...

554
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:10,450
你要另找答案
{\rEng}but you don't believe it. And you come up with this on your own.

555
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:16,620
- 是的  - 别紧张  我相信你
{\rEng}- Yes, sir.  - Relax, you've sold me.

556
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:24,500
汤米  计划航线  赶去"红航线一号"
{\rEng}Tommy, I want you to plot us a speed course for the bottom end of Red Route One.

557
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,420
进了海底峡谷就无法找到他们
{\rEng}We'll never find him in those canyons.

558
00:54:27,420 --> 00:54:30,180
我们先移动到潜望镜深度  但最好先通知总部
{\rEng}First take us to periscope depth. But first we'd better phone in.

559
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,470
遵命  舰长
{\rEng}Aye, aye, Captain.

560
00:54:41,230 --> 00:54:43,400
等等  钟斯
{\rEng}Hang on, Jonesy.

561
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:51,860
如果我们能靠近它  你可以追踪它吗?
{\rEng}If I can get you close enough, can you track this sucker?

562
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:58,250
是的  我听过它的声音  它逃不掉的
{\rEng}Yes, sir. Now that I know what to listen for... I'll bag him.

563
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:03,210
- 继续工作  - 遵命  长官
{\rEng}- Carry on.  - Yes, sir.

564
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:06,690
真是荒天下之大谬
{\rEng}That's the craziest notion I've ever heard...

565
00:55:06,690 --> 00:55:10,010
整艘潜艇全体成员都想叛变?
{\rEng}a serving line officer? An entire ballistic missile submarine?

566
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:14,510
就算只是军官叛变  我也不相信
{\rEng}They can't all want to defect, even if it's only the officers.

567
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:18,220
- 他有什么计划?  - 计划?
{\rEng}- What's his plan?  - His plan?

568
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,850
苏联人连上厕所也会预先计划
{\rEng}Russians don't take a dump without a plan.

569
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:24,350
高级军官
{\rEng}Senior captains don't start...

570
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:26,690
不会贸然冒险
{\rEng}something this dangerous without having thought the matter through.

571
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,200
- 他将要做什么  直接驶往纽约?
{\rEng}What's he going to do, he's just going to sail into New York?

572
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,200
- 可能就这么简单
{\rEng}It might be that simple.

573
00:55:31,360 --> 00:55:34,240
在中情局纸上谈兵当然简单
{\rEng}Things may appear simple in the cubicle at CIA.

574
00:55:34,410 --> 00:55:39,620
在北大西洋面对整队苏联战舰  那就复杂了
{\rEng}But in the middle of the North Atlantic they get a bit more complex.

575
00:55:39,790 --> 00:55:43,420
- 抽烟吗?  - 不  谢谢
{\rEng}- Smoke?  - No, thank you.

576
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:47,920
"海岸例行检查"是行不通的
{\rEng}And I don't think your notion of a few days inspection's going to wash either.

577
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:50,300
我们必须要彻底研究整艘潜艇
{\rEng}In order to be any value, you'd have to tear it apart.

578
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,510
这可能需要几个月
{\rEng}The metallurgy would take a couple of months.

579
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,970
- 那我们就扣押潜艇  - 船员怎么处置？
{\rEng}- Then we have to keep it.  - What will you do with the crew?

580
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:01,890
不愿叛变的人会回去告发我们
{\rEng}Ones that don't defect will go back and say we got the boat.

581
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:08,110
- 你打算杀了他们?  - 我们不是在打仗
{\rEng}- Or do you plan to eliminate them?  - We're not at war, sir.

582
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:11,990
我们要想办法不让他们知道
{\rEng}So you have to get them off the boat in such a way...

583
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,990
我们得到了潜艇
{\rEng}that they think we don't have it.

584
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:17,990
不能让苏联知道我们得到了潜艇
{\rEng}They'll go back and report that we don't have it to their bosses.

585
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:23,330
否则说什么也没用  对吗?
{\rEng}Otherwise, this whole business is just academic, right?

586
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,750
是  长官  我明白你的意思
{\rEng}Yes, sir. I think I see your point.

587
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:33,300
- 你上次睡觉是什么时候?  - 很久之前了
{\rEng}- When was the last time you slept?  - A while.

588
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,850
- 外面的长官会为你打点一切  - 谢谢你  长官
{\rEng}- The chief outside will fix you up.  - Thank you, sir.

589
00:56:39,010 --> 00:56:41,430
舰长
{\rEng}Captain.

590
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,940
天快亮了  我们在战斗情报中心
{\rEng}It'll be dawn in a couple of hours. We'll be in the CIC.

591
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:54,280
- 我们要面对种种危机  - 是的
{\rEng}- Things are liable to get a little dicey around here.  - Yes, sir.

592
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,710
- 你认为他疯了?  - 疯得可以
{\rEng}- You think he's crazy?  - Certifiable.

593
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:11,090
我不想见到他穿军服
{\rEng}And I don't care for him wearing the uniform.

594
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:14,150
看到那戒指吗? 72年毕业  他是海军陆战队成员
{\rEng}Did you see that ring on his finger? The Academy class of '72. A Marine.

595
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:17,050
不会吧...
{\rEng}You're kidding. How did you...

596
00:57:17,220 --> 00:57:24,100
格里尔告诉我  三年级时  他在直升机上遇上意外
{\rEng}Greer told me. Summer of his third year, he went down in a chopper accident.

597
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:27,690
很惨  机师和队员都死了
{\rEng}Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

598
00:57:27,690 --> 00:57:31,110
他花了十个月接受牵引治疗  花了一年学走路

你怎能分辨虚实?

659
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:05,040
我们必须派船去监视你们
{\rEng}Prudence demands that we deploy ships to observe yours.

说起来很尴尬

01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:05,470
鲍罗丁
{\rEng}Borodin?

716
01:09:11,180 --> 01:09:16,690
右满舵  右引擎反转

718
01:09:23,990 --> 01:09:30,410
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

719
01:09:33,450 --> 01:09:38,250
- 领航员  报告度数  - 偏离了十六度
{\rEng}- Navigator.  - 16 degrees off the bow plane.

720
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:06,700
- 他们向我们开火!  - 冷静点  小伙子
{\rEng}- Captain, they're really shooting at us! Why?  - Easy, boy.

721
01:10:06,860 --> 01:10:11,830
如果他们真的开火  我们早就死了
{\rEng}If they were really shooting at us, we'd be dead by now.

722
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:35,570
我知道履带出了什么问题
{\rEng}I found out what happened to the caterpillar.

723
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:38,940
缓冲器被破坏
{\rEng}The buffer circuit has been torn out.

724
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:42,160
履带迟早会负荷过重
{\rEng}It was only a matter of time, before an overload shut it down.

725
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:45,800
你说什么?
{\rEng}What are you saying?

726
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:49,290
有人知道如何弄坏履带而不被轻易发现
{\rEng}Whoever did this knew how to cripple the caterpillar in a way not easy to find.

727
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:52,790
艇上有内奸
{\rEng}Captain, we have a saboteur on board.

728
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,800
不会是军官  军官不会等到启航后才动手
{\rEng}It can't be any of the officers, They had plenty of time before we embarked.

729
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,720
这一定是水兵干的
{\rEng}Must be a member on the crew.

730
01:11:04,890 --> 01:11:09,930
翻查普金的档案  调查海员身份
{\rEng}Go to Putin's cabin. Check his files for information on the crew.

731
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,440
我们可能要提早遣散水兵
{\rEng}We may have to put them off before we planned.

732
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:19,690
"苏联人连上厕所  也会预先计划"
{\rEng}"Your average Russkie don't take a dump without a plan."

733
01:11:21,440 --> 01:11:24,200
等等
{\rEng}And wait a minute.

734
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:29,490
他已经有办法赶走船员了
{\rEng}We don't have to get the crew off the sub. He would have had to do that.

735
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:33,540
我们只需猜想他下一步要干什么
{\rEng}We just have to figure out what he's going to do.

736
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:37,420
如何赶走艇员
{\rEng}How is he going to get them off the sub?

737
01:11:38,750 --> 01:11:41,880
船员要有离艇的意图
{\rEng}They'd have to want to get off.

738
01:11:43,090 --> 01:11:47,930
船员为什么想离开潜艇?
{\rEng}How do you get a crew to want to get off a submarine?

739
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:52,180
船员为什么想离开核潜艇...
{\rEng}How do you get a crew to want to get off a nuclear sub...

740
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:56,400
- 我知道他会怎样赶走船员  - 我很忙  杰克
{\rEng}- I know how he'll get the crew off.  - Not now, Jack.

741
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:03,240
扬基一号进入紧急状态
{\rEng}Yankee One, declaring an emergency.

742
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:09,240

{\rEng}Yankee One, vector 270. Speed is buster, over.

743
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:11,870
扬基一号  再说一遍
{\rEng}Say again, Yankee One.

744
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,750
熊狐步号太接近部队
{\rEng}A Bear Foxtrot got too close to the group.

745
01:12:14,750 --> 01:12:17,460
它和一架F14战机相撞
{\rEng}One of the F-14s crowded him, and they bumped.

746
01:12:17,630 --> 01:12:23,090
战机损伤  他们引导它返回母舰
{\rEng}He's losing hydraulic fluid. They're trying to get him back aboard now.

747
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:26,050
- 忙碌的早晨  - 嗯
{\rEng}- Busy morning.  - Mmm.

748
01:12:26,220 --> 01:12:31,770
昨晚苏联战舰在东边港口戒备
{\rEng}During the night, Russian attack subs are now stationed off every East Coast port.

749
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:34,430
我们在这里
{\rEng}We're up here.

752
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,860
和海面舰队
{\rEng}and several surface groups.

753
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:47,410
- 火力强大  - 对于一支救援队的话  是的
{\rEng}- That's a lot of firepower.  - For a rescue team, yes.

754
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:49,200
还有一件怪事
{\rEng}And there's something else strange.

755
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,830
他们不关心声纳探测结果
{\rEng}They're using sonar as if they're looking for something, but nobody's listening.

756
01:12:50,830 --> 01:12:54,080
什么意思?
{\rEng}What do you mean?

757
01:12:54,250 --> 01:12:56,630
以30节的速度航行
{\rEng}At their speed of 30 knots,

758
01:12:56,650 --> 01:12:59,630
他们的声音大过我女儿的音响  居然听不到
{\rEng}they could run over my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

759
01:13:01,090 --> 01:13:04,130
- 他们不是寻找雷米斯  他们驱赶他
{\rEng}They're not trying to find Ramius, they're trying to drive him.

760
01:13:04,140 --> 01:13:06,130
- 驱赶他到哪里?

{\rEng}Your sub captain is going to make it to America, Mr. Ryan.

763
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,650
他将会在抵岸前身亡
{\rEng}He's going to die within sight of it.

764
01:13:19,810 --> 01:13:24,530
他的僚机要求准许发炮
{\rEng}His wing man kept requesting permission to fire.

765
01:13:24,690 --> 01:13:29,860
若有人轻举妄动  我们会卷入大战
{\rEng}omebody messes up, we'll be in the biggest naval battle since the Jutland. Jesus!

766
01:13:30,030 --> 01:13:34,990
- 水温太低  不能弹射  - 尝试登上甲板
{\rEng}- The water's too cold to eject.  - Air boss will try to bring him aboard.

767
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:39,290
- 这是什么潜艇?  - 巴特·曼库索的潜艇
{\rEng}- Excuse me, sir. What's this sub off by herself?  - Bart Mancuso's boat.

768
01:13:39,460 --> 01:13:42,750
他正赶去红航线一号
{\rEng}He's going to the bottom of Red Route One.

769
01:13:42,920 --> 01:13:47,470
他的电脑发现"岩浆移位"
{\rEng}He's had intermittent contact with a magma displacement. He's got this...

770
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:51,720
岩浆移位? 那不是地震学的问题吗?
{\rEng}Magma displacement? Is that like a seismic anomaly?

771
01:13:51,890 --> 01:13:54,700
应该是的  怎么了
{\rEng}I suppose so. Why?

772
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:57,520
- 可否让我登上达拉斯号?  - 去干什么?
{\rEng}- Is there a way you could get me on board the Dallas?  - What for?

01:13:57,680 --> 01:14:00,580
曼库索找到红十月号
{\rEng}Help Captain Mancuso found the Red October.

01:14:00,580 --> 01:14:03,480
他什么都没找到  他只是在等待
{\rEng}He hasn't found anything, Jack. He's just waiting.

775
01:14:03,650 --> 01:14:05,980
长官
{\rEng}Excuse me, sir.

776
01:14:05,980 --> 01:14:08,320
无声推进系统经常被误认为...
{\rEng}But this silent propulsion system could easily be mistaken for something...

777
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:11,950
只能坐直升机去达拉斯号
{\rEng}Jack, the only way to get you to the Dallas out there is by chopper.

778
01:14:12,120 --> 01:14:17,040
直升机可没有这么多燃料
{\rEng}is to use a chopper turned into a flying gas can.

779
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:22,250
救援扬基一号的部队准备好了
{\rEng}Excuse me, Admiral. Yankee One is on final. Rescue personnel are in place.

780
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:25,130
提升左翼
{\rEng}Pick up your left wing.

781
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:27,670
禁止着陆!

782
01:14:27,840 --> 01:14:30,840
座舱弹射!
{\rEng}Eject!

783
01:14:44,150 --> 01:14:49,860
这件事  会一发不可收拾
{\rEng}This business will get out of control and we'll be lucky to live through it.

784
01:15:02,580 --> 01:15:04,840
燃料倒是够
{\rEng}The bird's loaded down with enough fuel to get you there,

785
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,840
不过达拉斯号可能会离开原地点
{\rEng}but Dallas may not be there.

786
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,760
我们正在尝试联系它
{\rEng}We're trying to get message to her.

787
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:12,510
如果它下潜了  如果你要跳伞
{\rEng}If she's gone deep, it's dodgey. If you have to ditch...

788
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:24,230
如果要跳伞  记得拿求生装备
{\rEng}If you have to ditch, don't think about anything but the survival gear.

789
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:30,320
- 这种水温  你只能坚持四分钟
{\rEng}At this water temperature, you'll have about four minutes.

790
01:15:30,990 --> 01:15:36,660
- 我会记住的  下次记在备忘录上算了
{\rEng}I'll try to remember that. Next time, Jack, write a goddamn memo.

791
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:13,450
- 船长睡了?  - 是的
{\rEng}- Is the captain sacked out?  - Yeah.

792
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:18,660
- 他怎么样  - 他不愿离开
{\rEng}- What about him?  - He won't leave.

793
01:16:27,630 --> 01:16:31,880
我见过美人鱼
{\rEng}You know, I've seen a mermaid once.

794
01:16:32,050 --> 01:16:35,970
还见过鲨鱼吃八爪鱼
{\rEng}I've even seen a shark eat an octopus.

795
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:40,390
但没见过鬼魅一般的苏联潜艇
{\rEng}But I've never seen a phantom Russian submarine.

796
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:22,490
我们会探测情况
{\rEng}We're emerging from the route, Captain.

797
01:17:22,490 --> 01:17:23,980
缓冲板会按正常程序进行清理
{\rEng}I've ordered a routine clearing of the baffles.

798
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:25,980
在数分钟后转向
{\rEng}We'll be making the first turn in a few minutes.

799
01:17:26,140 --> 01:17:32,230
履带推进系统恢复正常工作
{\rEng}The caterpillar is operational and appears to be running normally.

800
01:17:32,400 --> 01:17:38,280
内奸的事令船员人心惶惶
{\rEng}The crew know about the saboteur and they are afraid.

801
01:17:40,200 --> 01:17:44,160
可以在适当时机利用这心态
{\rEng}Well, that could be useful when the time comes.

802
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:51,920
十六小时后  会到达拉布拉多海岸
{\rEng}You know, we could make the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

803
01:17:52,090 --> 01:17:55,710
那里太冷  船员会冻死
{\rEng}Half of them would freeze before they were rescued.

804
01:17:55,880 --> 01:17:59,930
四十八小时后  到马萨诸塞或缅因州
{\rEng}It's Massachusetts or Maine in 48 hours.

805
01:18:00,090 --> 01:18:03,300
两天
{\rEng}Two days.

806
01:18:09,850 --> 01:18:14,900
他们会不会让我住在蒙大拿州?
{\rEng}Do you think they will let me live in Montana?

807
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:25,410
你想住哪里都可以
{\rEng}I would think they'll let you live wherever you want.

808
01:18:25,580 --> 01:18:31,000
好  我会住在蒙大拿州
{\rEng}Good, then I will live in Montana.

{\rEng}I will marry a round American woman and raise rabbits.

810

811
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:43,470
我会买一辆小货车
{\rEng}And I will have a pickup truck.

812
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:49,930
可能还会买一辆旅行车
{\rEng}Or possibly even a recreational vehicle...

813
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:54,110
开着旅行车穿州过省
{\rEng}and drive from state to state.

- 可以这样做?  - 是的

{\rEng}- No papers?  - No papers. State to state.

816
01:19:03,410 --> 01:19:06,620
好  开始转向
{\rEng}All right. Commence your turn.

817
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:15,880
冬天住在亚利桑那州
{\rEng}Well then... in winter, I will live in Arizona.

818
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:21,630

{\rEng}- Actually, I think I will need two wives.  - Oh, at least.

{\rEng}- Conn! Sonar! Crazy Ivan!  - All stop. Quick quiet!

821

发生了什么  钟斯?
{\rEng}What's going on, Jonesy?

822
01:19:56,690 --> 01:19:59,920
苏联潜艇会突然急转  以探查自己是否被跟踪
{\rEng}Russian captains sometimes turn suddenly to see if anyone's behind them.

823
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:03,430
我们称之为"疯狂伊凡"
{\rEng}We call it Crazy Ivan.

824
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:06,260
我们要关掉所有机器
{\rEng}The only thing you can do is go dead, shut everything down...

825
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:08,930
销声匿迹
{\rEng}and make like a hole in the water.

826
01:20:09,100 --> 01:20:15,730
- 还有什么问题?  - 大船不能一下子停下来
{\rEng}- So what's the catch? - Catch is a boat this big doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

827
01:20:15,900 --> 01:20:21,360
如果我们太近  会被卷进它的船尾
{\rEng}If we're too close, we'll drift right into the back of him.

828
01:20:23,530 --> 01:20:26,990
你呢  有什么心愿?
{\rEng}What about you? What do you look forward to?

829
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:41,760
我再没有这种心情
{\rEng}I have no such appetites.

830
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,760
看看他们能否能听见我们
{\rEng}Let's see if he can hear us.

831
01:20:50,470 --> 01:20:52,970
一定还有事情想做
{\rEng}There must be something.

832
01:21:00,900 --> 01:21:04,070
你想做什么?
{\rEng}What is it?

833
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:10,830
我怀念小时候
{\rEng}I miss the peace of fishing.

834
01:21:10,990 --> 01:21:14,700
宁静地钓鱼的日子
{\rEng}Like when I was a boy.

835
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:22,880
四十年来  我一直航海  海上的战争
{\rEng}40 years I've been sailing at sea. A war at sea.

836
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:31,890
一场没有战役的战争  没有纪念碑
{\rEng}A war with no battles. No monuments.

837
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:35,480
只有死伤者
{\rEng}Only casualties.

838
01:21:38,850 --> 01:21:42,820
妻子在结婚当日  变成寡妇
{\rEng}I widowed her the day I married her.

839
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:49,490
她去世的时候  我还在船上
{\rEng}My wife died while I was at sea.

840
01:22:08,130 --> 01:22:11,220
找人看守轮机舱
{\rEng}Post guards in the engineering spaces.

841
01:22:11,390 --> 01:22:16,220
弄坏履带的人  会做出更严重的破坏
{\rEng}If he can get to the caterpillar, he can get to somewhere more vital.

842
01:22:19,140 --> 01:22:21,960
钟斯  他在那里?
{\rEng}Where is he, Jonesy?

843
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,770
目标在我们右舷
{\rEng}Conn, Sonar. Target is now coming out of our starboard baffles.

844
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:29,280
他想回到原来的路线
{\rEng}My read is that he's returning to base course.

845
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:35,160
- 他回到航线210  - 他环绕我们
{\rEng}- Concur, he's returning to course 210.  - He went right around us.

846
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:40,370
等三十秒  然后取消静航
{\rEng}Give him another 30 seconds. Then secure from silent running.

847
01:22:40,540 --> 01:22:45,170
我们收到讯息
{\rEng}Captain, here's what we got on the ELF.

848
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:49,720
- 谢谢  - 不用谢  长官
{\rEng}- Thanks.  - Aye, sir.

849
01:22:56,890 --> 01:23:00,730
是什么?
{\rEng}What is it?

850
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:03,980
你绝对不相信
{\rEng}You're not going to believe this.

851
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,450
我们要及早返航
{\rEng}Commander, we're approaching no return.

852
01:23:18,450 --> 01:23:20,620
达拉斯号没收到信息
{\rEng}Dallas apparently hasn't gotten the message.

853
01:23:20,790 --> 01:23:23,020
- 我们要返航  - 再等一会儿
{\rEng}- We have to turn back.  - Give it a couple more minutes.

854
01:23:23,020 --> 01:23:25,250
不行  燃料快不够了
{\rEng}Negative. Fuel status says we turn around now.

855
01:23:25,420 --> 01:23:29,550
等等  你们没有后备燃料吗?
{\rEng}Wait a minute. Fuel status? You got a reserve, don't you?

856
01:23:29,710 --> 01:23:31,780
我有十分钟后备燃料
{\rEng}Yes, sir. I've got a ten minute reserve.

857
01:23:31,780 --> 01:23:33,840
但只有作战时才可动用
{\rEng}But I'm not allowed to invade that except during war.

858
01:23:34,010 --> 01:23:38,770
如果你不让我上潜艇  战争会爆发
{\rEng}Mr. If you don't get me on that goddamn submarine, you might have it.

859
01:23:38,930 --> 01:23:43,100
如果有燃料  我们再等十分钟吧
{\rEng}You got 10 minutes worth of fuel. we stay here ten more minutes.

860
01:23:46,610 --> 01:23:52,070
东边两英里处发现潜艇
{\rEng}Yo! Mount up! Yo, I got a submarine at around 3:00. About two miles.

861
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:56,740
好  给他戴上工具
{\rEng}Okay, Tony, hook him up.

862
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,080
好的  我们把你放到潜艇下面去
{\rEng}OK, Commander. I'll be lowering you down to the submarine now.

863
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:04,040
希望这东西能把烟当作燃料
{\rEng}Give me eight minutes. Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

864
01:24:04,210 --> 01:24:10,090
浮上海面  这家伙要吃苦了
{\rEng}Very well. Surface the ship. Whoever this guy is, he's in for one hell of a ride.

865
01:24:10,260 --> 01:24:13,760
好了  坐下来
{\rEng}Okay, Commander, go ahead and sit down.

866
01:24:13,930 --> 01:24:19,100
- 有经验吗?  - 试过一次  当时风平浪静
{\rEng}- Did you ever do this before?  - Once, on a calm day... off Hawaii.

867
01:24:19,260 --> 01:24:22,850
直升机无法稳定地飞行
{\rEng}The pilot will have a difficult time keeping steady.

868
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:26,190
拿着这棒  以防电击
{\rEng}Don't take chances getting grounded. Keep that rod in front of you.

869
01:24:26,350 --> 01:24:30,900
旋翼的静电  能点亮芝加哥城
{\rEng}In air like this, the rotors will be putting out enough static to light up Chicago.

870
01:24:31,070 --> 01:24:35,530
我预备了潜水员  他可能会坠海
{\rEng}A diver's in the escape trunk in case this guy goes in the drink.

871
01:24:35,700 --> 01:24:39,370
对  这疯子想玩命!
{\rEng}Someone must have a burr up his ass to go for a stunt like this.

872
01:25:03,810 --> 01:25:07,730
如果我要把你带上来  我会摇绳子和竖起大拇指
{\rEng}Commander, if I got to bring you back up, I'm going to shake the wire.

873
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:12,780
两手交叉  记住了吗?
{\rEng}I'll give you a thumbs up, like this. Remember to cross your arms.

874
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:16,110
好的  出发吧
{\rEng}Okay, out you go. Passenger's out the door.

875
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:26,960
乘客出来了  在半空中往前荡
{\rEng}He's halfway down. You're drifting forward.

876
01:25:31,250 --> 01:25:34,590
好的  勾着他的绳
{\rEng}All right. Get the hook on his cable.

877
01:25:34,760 --> 01:25:38,800
注意  别碰他  他来了
{\rEng}Watch it! Don't touch him. Okay, here he comes.

878
01:25:45,680 --> 01:25:50,020
风太大了  我看不见他
{\rEng}It'd be easier without that crosswind. I can't see him.

879
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:55,360
别碰他
{\rEng}Don't touch him!

880
01:25:59,950 --> 01:26:04,540
- 行不通  - 拉他回来吧
{\rEng}- This is never going to work.  - OK. Reel him back in.

881
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:14,380
托尼  他怎么了...
{\rEng}Tony, what's the hell going on back...

882
01:26:17,260 --> 01:26:20,180
达拉斯号  有没有准备潜水员?
{\rEng}Dallas, have you got a swimmer?

883
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,970
有人在左舷坠海  派出潜水员
{\rEng}Man overboard, port side. Send out the diver.

884
01:26:25,140 --> 01:26:29,140
好的  达拉斯号  我们要走了
{\rEng}Very well. Dallas, we are history.

885
01:26:36,690 --> 01:26:40,950
救下面那位博士  我去逃生舱
{\rEng}Get the doc down here. I'll be in the escape trunk.

886
01:26:44,080 --> 01:26:48,040
拿梯子来  打开舱盖
{\rEng}Down ladder. Make a hole.

887
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:08,350
你好  舰长  我很高兴能上舰
{\rEng}How do you do, Captain? It's a pleasure to be aboard.

888
01:27:10,640 --> 01:27:14,310
我要跟总统说话
{\rEng}I have to talk to the President.

889
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,940
好的  请问为何事?
{\rEng}Of course. May I enquire as to the subject?

890
01:27:19,740 --> 01:27:23,050
看来我们先前的报告不太准确
{\rEng}It seems that the initial reports that...

891
01:27:23,050 --> 01:27:26,370
我们的潜艇没有失踪
{\rEng}one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate.

892
01:27:28,450 --> 01:27:33,710
该艘潜艇由马尔科·雷米斯指挥
{\rEng}The submarine in question is commanded by Captain Marko Ramius.

893
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:39,380
他陷入精神崩溃的状态
{\rEng}Apparently, he has suffered a kind of mental nervous breakdown.

894
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:47,140
在出发前  他寄信给巴度宁上将
{\rEng}Just before he sailed, he posted a letter to Admiral Padorin...

895
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:50,180
他宣称  想向美国...
{\rEng}in which he announced his intention to...

896
01:27:52,390 --> 01:27:55,440
发射导弹
{\rEng}to fire his missiles on the United States.

897
01:27:57,110 --> 01:27:59,860
上次为什么不告诉我?
{\rEng}Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met?

898
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:02,360
莫斯科不会
{\rEng}In my position I'm sometimes compromised...

899
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:04,700
告诉我所有事情
{\rEng}by the fact Moscow doesn't always tell me everything.

900
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:09,660
你们的潜艇舰长疯了? 你要我们怎么做?
{\rEng}So one of your submarine captains has gone insane? What do you want from us?

901
01:28:09,830 --> 01:28:13,160
需要你们帮个忙
{\rEng}You offered your assistance.

902
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:16,500
本来是个营救行动  现在你让我们帮你除掉他
{\rEng}That was a rescue mission. Now you want us to help you hunt him down and kill him.

903
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:22,970
我奉命来请贵国总统帮忙
{\rEng}I have been instructed to ask your president for precisely that.

904
01:28:23,130 --> 01:28:28,510
我们已经找到他  但我们要为你停下来
{\rEng}Find him? We already found him. We had to break off to pick you up.

905
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:32,930
- 喝杯咖啡  还是抽支烟?  - 我不抽烟
{\rEng}- Coffee. A cigarette?  - I don't smoke.

906
01:28:33,100 --> 01:28:37,900
假设我们找到他  然后怎么办?
{\rEng}Assuming we can find him, just what exactly am I supposed to do about it?

907
01:28:38,060 --> 01:28:42,320
舰长  通讯室报告  收到紧急讯号
{\rEng}Captain, radio. We're receiving flash traffic on the emergency circuit.

908
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:44,650
好的  翻译它
{\rEng}Very well. Bring it down.

909
01:28:46,240 --> 01:28:48,950
瑞恩先生
{\rEng}Well, Mr. Ryan?

910
01:28:50,790 --> 01:28:55,210
- 大副  让我们单独谈谈  - 雷纳德  过来
{\rEng}- Chief, excuse us for a second.  - Leonard, come on out of there.

911
01:29:01,590 --> 01:29:04,590
我们在追踪红十月号
{\rEng}The sub we're after is called the Red October.

912
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:07,590
舰长是马尔科·雷米斯
{\rEng}She's under the command of a man named Ramius.

913
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,530
他和艇上部分军官
{\rEng}Now, there's the possibility that he and a good portion...

914
01:29:10,530 --> 01:29:13,310
可能想叛变
{\rEng}of his crew are attempting to defect.

915
01:29:15,730 --> 01:29:18,650
叛变?
{\rEng}Defect?

916
01:29:18,810 --> 01:29:20,940
对不起
{\rEng}Excuse me.

917
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:40,040
- 那潜艇叫红十月号?  - 对
{\rEng}- You say the boat's called the Red October?  - That's right.

918
01:29:40,040 --> 01:29:42,670
- 舰长是雷米斯?  - 对
{\rEng}- Skipper's Ramius?  - Right.

919
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:48,010
看来形势转变了  瑞恩
{\rEng}It seems that circumstances have changed somewhat, Mr. Ryan.

920
01:29:54,970 --> 01:29:59,100
- 给他干衣服  我在指挥台等他  - 遵命  舰长
{\rEng}- Get this man some dry clothes. I'll be in the conn.  - Aye, sir.

921
01:29:59,270 --> 01:30:01,650
"苏军潜艇红十月号舰长
{\rEng}"National Command Authority informed Soviet typhoon class submarine...

922
01:30:01,650 --> 01:30:04,030
马尔科·雷米斯
{\rEng}Red October Marko Ramius...

923
01:30:04,190 --> 01:30:08,950
可能叛变  准备擅自发射导弹"
{\rEng}is potential renegade and threatens independent missile launch.

924
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:12,300
"你有权采取任何行动
{\rEng}"You are authorized to use any necessary force...

925
01:30:12,300 --> 01:30:15,500
防止它接近美国海岸"
{\rEng}to prevent said submarine from approaching the coast of the United States."

926
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:34,760
左转10度  航向265
{\rEng}Left 10 degrees rudder steady on course 265.

927
01:30:38,600 --> 01:30:41,480
舱内亮红色灯
{\rEng}Chief of the Watch, rig for red.

928
01:30:51,780 --> 01:30:54,260
- 什么事?  - 已部署好战斗岗位
{\rEng}- What's going on?  - Battle stations are manned and ready, Captain.

929
01:30:54,260 --> 01:30:56,750
很好
{\rEng}Very well.

930
01:30:56,910 --> 01:31:00,020
舰长  我要跟你谈谈
{\rEng}Captain, I have to talk to you.

931
01:31:00,020 --> 01:31:03,130
现在不行  潜至一千二百英尺  俯倾20度
{\rEng}Not now. Tommy, make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down angle.

932
01:31:03,290 --> 01:31:08,630
潜水官  潜至一千二百英尺  俯倾20度
{\rEng}Diving officer, make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down.

933
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:14,680
全速下潜
{\rEng}Full dive on fair water planes. Full dive on stern planes.

934
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:21,390
450英尺  潜至1200英尺
{\rEng}Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

935
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,310
500英尺
{\rEng}500.

936
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:28,490
600英尺
{\rEng}600.

937
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:31,950
700英尺
{\rEng}700.

938
01:31:35,740 --> 01:31:39,370
- 一切顺利?  - 是的  舰长
{\rEng}- Did you get a good fix?  - Yes, Captain.

939
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:50,920
- 钟斯  发现他了吗?  - 很微弱  舰长  正在监听
{\rEng}- Sonar, conn, have you got him yet, Jonesy?  - Very faint, sir. Hold on.

940
01:31:52,470 --> 01:31:56,970
250方位  发现台风七号  在我们预想的位置
{\rEng}Yes, sir. Contact typhoon seven on bearing 250. Right where he's supposed to be.

941
01:31:57,140 --> 01:32:01,680
- 他有否发觉我们?  - 没有
{\rEng}- Any sign he's alerted to our presence?  - No. Operating as before.

942
01:32:01,850 --> 01:32:06,940
左转到265  溜到他们背后
{\rEng}Come left to 265. Bring us up behind him quietly, Tommy.

943
01:32:07,110 --> 01:32:09,690
再下潜五百英尺
{\rEng}Make your depth 500 feet.

944
01:32:18,870 --> 01:32:22,290
舰长  让我说两分钟
{\rEng}Please listen to me. Two minutes, that's all.

945
01:32:24,290 --> 01:32:28,550
- 导航  何时能进入它的航道?  - 四分钟后
{\rEng}- Plot, time to intercept his track.  - Four minutes, Captain.

946
01:32:28,710 --> 01:32:32,050
好吧  给你两分钟  瑞恩
{\rEng}Very well, Mr. Ryan. Two minutes.

947
01:32:38,640 --> 01:32:42,560
那些指示很合理  但实情是...
{\rEng}I understand that message, it makes perfect sense. But the situation is...

948
01:32:42,730 --> 01:32:45,060
雷米斯想叛变
{\rEng}Ramius intends to defect.

949
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,400
所以苏军一直想击沉他
{\rEng}The Russians know this, which is why they've tried to sink him...

950
01:32:47,560 --> 01:32:49,820
- 但他们无能为力  - 发炮程式准备好了
{\rEng}- But they haven't been able to. So... - I have a firing solution.

{\rEng}- and scuttle the ship. - You will receive the Order of Lenin for this, Captain.

1078
01:45:36,040 --> 01:45:41,590
我们离船  舰长会跟潜艇一起沉没

1082
01:46:45,990 --> 01:46:48,780

指挥员  听着
{\rEng}Now, understand, Commander...

1090
01:47:36,410 --> 01:47:39,710
那鱼雷没有自我毁灭  你听到它撞到船体
{\rEng}that torpedo did not self-destruct. You heard it hit the hull.

1091
01:47:39,870 --> 01:47:43,840
我没有来过这里
{\rEng}And I was never here.

{\rEng}Two million things can still go wrong with this stunt.

1094
01:48:02,020 --> 01:48:07,690
中情局的人真没头脑
{\rEng}Central Intelligence Agency... there's a contradiction in terms.

1095
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:11,570
咖啡味道如何  瑞恩?
{\rEng}How's the coffee, Ryan?

1096
01:48:11,740 --> 01:48:17,410
达拉斯号  神秘号准备出发

{\rEng}It's wise to study the ways of one's adversary.

1117
01:53:40,440 --> 01:53:42,530
说得对
{\rEng}It is.

1118
01:53:44,530 --> 01:53:49,490
你还记得吗  我们在列宁格勒领事馆见过面
{\rEng}I doubt you'd remember, but we met once at the consulate in Leningrad.

1119
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:55,250
尊夫人的事  我很难过
{\rEng}Along with your wife. I'm very sorry.

1120
01:53:55,420 --> 01:54:00,170
为什么无故向我的船发炮?
{\rEng}What gives you the right to fire on my ship?

1121
01:54:00,340 --> 01:54:04,590
- 你的讯息没有提及鱼雷  - 瑞恩
{\rEng}- Your signal said nothing of a torpedo.  - Ryan.

1122
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:08,660
我们要误导你的船员
{\rEng}It was necessary to maintain the illusion for your crew.

1123
01:54:08,660 --> 01:54:11,470
他们会获救吗?
{\rEng}My crew are being rescued, yes?

1124

- 是你发的讯号?  - 是的
{\rEng}- You sent the signal?  - That's correct, sir.

1126
01:54:22,980 --> 01:54:28,910
你怎么知道我们的反应堆事故是假的?
{\rEng}Then how did you know our reactor accident was false?

1127
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:32,200
我循常理推测的
{\rEng}That was a guess, but it seemed logical.

1128
01:54:38,880 --> 01:54:41,630
很好
{\rEng}Very well.

1129
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:49,890
我把弹道导弹潜艇红十月号交出来
{\rEng}I present to you the ballistic missile submarine Red October.

1130
01:54:54,100 --> 01:55:00,650

{\rEng}My officers and I request asylum in the United States of America.

1131
01:55:03,020 --> 01:55:08,490

{\rEng}It's a pleasure, sir. Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1132
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:13,430
鱼雷  美国人又开火了
{\rEng}Torpedo. The Americans are shooting at us again.

1133
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:16,860
声调太高了  这是苏联鱼雷
{\rEng}The pitch is too high. The torpedo's Russian.

1134
01:55:16,930 --> 01:55:20,180
还有鱼雷? 从哪里来
{\rEng}What do you mean another torpedo? Where the hell did it come from?

1135
01:55:20,250 --> 01:55:24,250
指挥室  声纳发现苏联雅夫级潜艇  呼号4-1
{\rEng}Conn, Sonar. New contact. Sierra 4-1. Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1136
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:30,910
声纳  为何不引爆?
{\rEng}Sonar, why don't I have a detonation?

1137
01:55:30,910 --> 01:55:32,520
目标距离太近
{\rEng}The weapon enabled on the far side of the target.

1138
01:55:32,530 --> 01:55:34,220
鱼雷来不及引爆
{\rEng}It passed Red October before arming.

1139
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:38,440
你计算错误  重新装填  以正确参数重新发射鱼雷
{\rEng}You had the wrong range. Fire again with the right setting and reload both tubes.

1140
01:55:38,600 --> 01:55:43,570
加强能源  叫深海救助艇离开
{\rEng}Get me power, and get that damn thing off my boat.

1141
01:55:43,730 --> 01:55:49,030
- 有人向我们发射鱼雷  - 混帐  走吧
{\rEng}- I think somebody shot a torpedo at us.  - No shit, Buckwheat. Get out of here.

1142
01:55:57,370 --> 01:56:01,790
舰长正在与他们交战

01:56:13,050 --> 01:56:17,270
- 中情局?  - 我只是为他们写书
{\rEng}- CIA?  - I'm not an agent. I just write books for the CIA.

1146
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,640
不管这些  坐下来  照我的吩咐做
{\rEng}Whatever. Sit down. And do exactly what I tell you.

1147

{\rEng}No, that's wrong! Ryan, don't turn that goddamn wheel.

1156

航向315
{\rEng}315.

1157
01:57:25,380 --> 01:57:29,500
- 你想冲向鱼雷  - 是的

{\rEng}- Melekhin, more speed.  - Negative. We're already at 110%.

他想冲向鱼雷...
{\rEng}He's heading right at the torpedo.

1165
01:58:01,840 --> 01:58:03,350
自杀
{\rEng}What's he trying to do, kill himself?

1166
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:04,860
我们能否
{\rEng}We have a firing solution...

1167
01:58:04,860 --> 01:58:06,370
向苏联雅夫级潜艇开火?
{\rEng}on the Russian alfa. Can we shoot back?

1168
01:58:06,540 --> 01:58:11,300
他们没有向我们开火  我不能擅自向苏联潜艇开火

1174
01:58:41,990 --> 01:58:46,870
你的结论错了  哈尔西战术失当
{\rEng}Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.

01:59:14,900 --> 01:59:19,410
- 怎么了?  - 这是战略
{\rEng}- What happened?  - Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

1180
01:59:19,570 --> 01:59:21,620
舰长将射程缩短了
{\rEng}By turning into the torpedo,

1181
01:59:21,670 --> 01:59:25,620
鱼雷来不及引爆
{\rEng}the captain closed the distance before it could arm itself.

1182
01:59:25,790 --> 01:59:28,620
- 没事了?  - 还不一定
{\rEng}- So that's it?  - Not quite.

1183
01:59:28,790 --> 01:59:32,420
图波列夫舰长会解除武器安全系统
{\rEng}Right now, Captain Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons.

1184
01:59:32,420 --> 01:59:36,050
他不会重蹈覆辙
{\rEng}He won't make the same mistake twice.

1185
01:59:36,210 --> 01:59:41,550
- 瓦西里  发炮程式准备好了?  - 还没完全准备好...
{\rEng}- Vasily, have you plotted a solution yet?  - It's a little rough, but I...

1186
01:59:48,060 --> 01:59:51,190
- 枪声  - 听起来好像是的  长官
{\rEng}- Gunfire.  - That's what it sounded like, sir.

1187
01:59:51,350 --> 01:59:55,190
- 他不会改变主意?  - 是船员作怪
{\rEng}- He won't change his mind, Mr. Ryan.  - It's one of the crew.

1188
01:59:55,360 --> 01:59:59,200
不管他是谁  他有二心
{\rEng}Well, Whoever he is, I'd say he's having second thoughts.

1189
02:00:15,210 --> 02:00:18,630
我想看看蒙大拿
{\rEng}I would like to have seen Montana.

1190
02:00:31,730 --> 02:00:34,750
舰长  他跑进导弹库
{\rEng}Captain, he stumbled forward into the missile bay.

1191
02:00:34,750 --> 02:00:37,780
20号舱响起警报
{\rEng}There's a silo hatch warning... port side, number 20.

1192
02:00:37,940 --> 02:00:42,110
- 他不能发射导弹吧?  - 不能  但是他能够引爆导弹
{\rEng}- He can't launch a missile?  - No, but he can blow one up.

1193
02:00:44,320 --> 02:00:47,410
舰长  守着指挥台
{\rEng}Captain, take the conn. Fire control's blasted to hell.

1194
02:00:47,420 --> 02:00:49,410
躲在他后面吧
{\rEng}Get in behind him and stay there.

1195
02:00:49,580 --> 02:00:52,290
舰长  慢着
{\rEng}Captain, wait.

1196
02:00:54,960 --> 02:00:58,090
你可能需要这个  舰长
{\rEng}You may need this, sir.

1197
02:01:00,800 --> 02:01:03,090
谢谢
{\rEng}Thank you.

1198
02:01:05,720 --> 02:01:08,700
别光站着  跟着他  拿着家伙过去
{\rEng}Don't just stand there, Ryan, go with him!

1199
02:01:08,700 --> 02:01:10,190
- 你会说英语?  - 是的
{\rEng}- You, you speak English?  - Yes, sir.

1200
02:01:10,190 --> 02:01:11,680
你也跟着去
{\rEng}get your butt over here.

1201
02:01:11,850 --> 02:01:15,190
舰长  鱼雷未命中
{\rEng}Captain, torpedo broke off on impact.

1202
02:01:15,190 --> 02:01:16,860
妈的  解除鱼雷保险
{\rEng}Goddamn it! Set the safety ranges for zero now.

1203
02:01:16,860 --> 02:01:18,530
舰长  我已经尽快在弄了
{\rEng}Captain, I can't go any faster.

1204
02:01:18,690 --> 02:01:23,240
千万不能让他破坏点火电路
{\rEng}We must get him before he gets to the ignition circuits.

1205
02:01:30,370 --> 02:01:33,920
破坏点火电路会有什么后果?
{\rEng}What happens if he gets to that ignition circuitry?

1206
02:01:34,080 --> 02:01:37,090
他会烧毁整艘潜艇
{\rEng}He can incinerate the ship.

1207
02:01:44,470 --> 02:01:49,140
- 这个门是唯一出口?  - 是的
{\rEng}- That door is the only way out of here?  - Yes.

1208
02:01:49,310 --> 02:01:54,480
- 别让他跑掉  - 瑞恩...
{\rEng}- Don't let him get past you.  - Ryan...

1209
02:01:54,640 --> 02:01:58,020
小心开枪
{\rEng}Be careful what you shoot at.

1210
02:01:58,190 --> 02:02:03,030
这里有很多东西不能中弹
{\rEng}Most things in here don't react too well to bullets.

1211
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:07,530
对
{\rEng}Right.

1212
02:02:24,840 --> 02:02:27,760
你不知道小心开枪吗?
{\rEng}Be careful what I shoot at?

1213
02:02:36,020 --> 02:02:40,110
- 鱼雷保险解除了  -  声纳  红十月号在哪里?
{\rEng}- Safety ranges set to zero.  - Sonar, give me the bearing for Red October.

1214
02:02:40,270 --> 02:02:45,990
- 它在我们后面  - 右满舵  我要打败他
{\rEng}- She's taking positioned behind us.  - Right full rudder. I'll shake the man loose.

1215
02:02:52,200 --> 02:02:55,870
- 它在下潜  - 俯倾30度
{\rEng}- He's going deep.  - 30 degree down angle.

1216
02:02:56,040 --> 02:02:58,710
反鱼雷在那边? 很好
{\rEng}All the countermeasures were over there, right? Very well.

1217
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:28,200
司令  雅夫级潜艇太快  他们逃不掉的
{\rEng}Admiral, the alfa's too quick. It's only a matter of time on search.

1218
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:33,450
"瑞恩  这里有很多东西不能中弹..."
{\rEng}"Ryan, some things in here don't react well to bullets..."

1219
02:03:33,620 --> 02:03:37,410
对  我也不能中弹
{\rEng}Yeah, like me. I don't react well to bullets.

1220
02:03:57,020 --> 02:04:00,230
- 钟斯  他在哪里?  - 距离很近
{\rEng}- Where is he, Jonesy?  - Close, sir.

1221
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:05,650
- 正前方900米  - 终于找到了
{\rEng}- 900 meters, directly ahead.  - Got him.

1222
02:04:05,820 --> 02:04:08,990
- 校准后发射  - 距离太近
{\rEng}- Mark bearings and fire.  - We are too close.

1223
02:04:09,150 --> 02:04:14,530
别争论  发射鱼雷
{\rEng}Don't argue with me. Do it now!

1224
02:04:16,040 --> 02:04:19,500
又发射了一颗鱼雷  它随时会爆炸
{\rEng}Another torpedo. It went active the moment it was launched.

1225
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:24,460
- 左满舵  平衡舰首  - 鱼雷锁定我们了
{\rEng}- Left full rudder. Ease off on your bow planes.  - I think he's got us.

1226
02:04:34,390 --> 02:04:37,810
达拉斯号  干得漂亮!
{\rEng}Way to go, Dallas!

1227
02:04:41,560 --> 02:04:46,690
鱼雷在五百码外冲过来  你成功了
{\rEng}Torpedo is in acquisition. Range 500 yards and closing. You've done it, Thompson!

1228
02:04:46,860 --> 02:04:51,150
希望这行得通  大副  浮上水面
{\rEng}I hope this works. All right, chief, put us on the roof.

1229
02:04:51,320 --> 02:04:54,780
准备发射反鱼雷  听我命令  五  四...
{\rEng}Countermeasure station, on my mark. 5, 4...

1230
02:04:57,490 --> 02:05:02,620
发射反鱼雷  紧急上浮
{\rEng}Release counter measures. Emergency blow. Full rise.

1231
02:05:09,800 --> 02:05:13,390
500英尺
{\rEng}500 feet.

1232
02:05:13,550 --> 02:05:16,970
快点上浮
{\rEng}Come on, Big D. Fly!

1233
02:05:35,820 --> 02:05:39,490
鱼雷没停下来  它在寻找别的目标
{\rEng}That torpedo is still active. It's searching for another target, now.

1234
02:06:04,730 --> 02:06:09,940
竟然是他X的厨师
{\rEng}A goddamn cook.

1235
02:06:32,760 --> 02:06:35,880
它锁定我们了!
{\rEng}Torpedo is locked on us!

1236
02:06:36,050 --> 02:06:38,850
- 雅夫级潜艇离我们多近?  - 左后方1000码处
{\rEng}- How close is that Alfa, Jonesy?  - 1,000 yards dead astern, going to port.

1237
02:06:38,850 --> 02:06:41,640
- 反方向转  - 遵命
{\rEng}- Reverse your turn.  - Aye,sir.

1238
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:51,360
我们冲向敌方  鱼雷跟着我们
{\rEng}We're turning straight at him. Torpedo's still on our tail.

1239
02:06:55,240 --> 02:07:00,030
在适当的时候退开
{\rEng}The hard part about playing chicken is knowing when to flinch.

1240
02:07:05,410 --> 02:07:09,460
距离400码  350码  300码...
{\rEng}Collision in 400 yards, 350, 300...

1241
02:07:09,630 --> 02:07:15,340
- 舰长!  - 右满舵  俯倾30度
{\rEng}- Captain!  - Right full rudder. 30 degree down angle.

1242
02:07:15,510 --> 02:07:18,970
这次必定很惊险
{\rEng}This one's going to be close.

1243
02:07:21,890 --> 02:07:25,640
你个傲慢的傻瓜  你会害死我们
{\rEng}You arrogant ass, you've killed us.

1244
02:07:54,000 --> 02:07:57,130
我们确定了红十月号的位置
{\rEng}We have ascertained the Red October's final position.

1245
02:07:57,760 --> 02:08:00,720
但爆炸碎片
{\rEng}But...given the depth of the water and the spread of...

1246
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:03,680
遍布深海
{\rEng}the wreckage spreads across a wide area...

1247
02:08:03,850 --> 02:08:06,770
我们要花一段时间调查
{\rEng}it'll be some time before anything's recovered.

1248
02:08:06,930 --> 02:08:09,750
你们的人正在
{\rEng}However, your people are interviewing...

1249
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:12,560
安排船员回国
{\rEng}the crew now and making arrangements for their return.

1250
02:08:12,730 --> 02:08:17,070
这是一场悲惨的意外  大使先生
{\rEng}This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador.

1251
02:08:17,240 --> 02:08:22,490
如果早点找我们  悲剧可能不会发生
{\rEng}And I can only stress hat if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avoided.

1252
02:08:23,580 --> 02:08:29,500
- 我欣赏你坦诚的性格  - 彼此彼此
{\rEng}- I appreciate your candor in the matter.  - And I yours, Andrei.

1253
02:08:32,250 --> 02:08:35,090
可能在将来
{\rEng}Perhaps in the future...

1254
02:08:35,090 --> 02:08:37,920
会有更先进的科技来研究潜艇残骸
{\rEng}the technology will be available for an investigation of the wreckage.

1255
02:08:38,090 --> 02:08:41,970
也许吧
{\rEng}Perhaps.

1256
02:08:46,260 --> 02:08:52,650
- 还有一件事  我难以启齿...  - 请说
{\rEng}- There is another matter, one that I'm reluctant to...  - Please.

1257
02:08:54,150 --> 02:09:01,240
一艘雅夫级潜艇  曾经在大浅滩出没
{\rEng}One of our submarines, an Alfa, was last reported in the area of the Grand Banks.

1258
02:09:01,400 --> 02:09:05,660
它跟我们失去联络
{\rEng}We've not heard from her for some time.

1259
02:09:06,950 --> 02:09:11,500
又一艘潜艇失踪?
{\rEng}Andrei. You've lost another submarine?

1260
02:09:25,890 --> 02:09:30,390
长途跋涉来  把潜艇藏在河里
{\rEng}All this way to hide a submarine in a river.

1261
02:09:31,600 --> 02:09:34,670
这儿距离海军基地一百英里
{\rEng}We're 100 miles from the nearest naval base...

1262
02:09:34,670 --> 02:09:37,730
而且卫星不会再窥探这地方
{\rEng}for the last place that satellites will ever look.

1263
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:43,110
我在这里长大
{\rEng}I grew up around here.

1264
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:48,620
祖父在那个岛教我钓鱼
{\rEng}My grandfather taught me to fish off that island over there.

1265
02:09:51,660 --> 02:09:58,630
你心里还有一个疑问  为什么不问?
{\rEng}There is one question you haven't asked me yet. Why?

1266
02:10:00,420 --> 02:10:03,760
在适当的时候  你自然会说出来
{\rEng}Well, I figured you would tell me when you were ready.

1267
02:10:06,680 --> 02:10:11,310
有人说  我们要主动攻打美国
{\rEng}Now, there are those who believe we should attack the United States first.

1268
02:10:11,470 --> 02:10:17,980
了却一切恩怨  红十月号就是为此而建造的
{\rEng}Settle everything in one moment. Red October was built for that purpose.

1269
02:10:18,150 --> 02:10:23,700
然后  莫斯科会付出沉重的代价
{\rEng}When the dust settles from this, there's going to be hell to pay in Moscow.

1270
02:10:23,860 --> 02:10:27,070
那可能是好事
{\rEng}Maybe some good will come from it.

1271
02:10:27,240 --> 02:10:32,910
一场小革命能整顿国家  你觉得呢?
{\rEng}A little revolution now and then is a healthy thing, do you think?

1272
02:10:38,710 --> 02:10:42,510
- 你仍然喜欢钓鱼吗  瑞恩?  - 是的
{\rEng}- Do you still like to fish, Ryan?  - Mmm.

1273
02:10:43,920 --> 02:10:47,840
维尔纳斯有一条河  跟这里差不多
{\rEng}There's a river, not unlike this one, near Vilnius...

1274
02:10:48,010 --> 02:10:52,680
我祖父在那里教我钓鱼
{\rEng}where my grandfather taught me to fish.

{\rEng}"And the sea will grant each man new hope."

1276
02:10:58,650 --> 02:11:02,360
"正如睡眠带来梦境"
{\rEng}"As sleep brings dreams."

1277
02:11:08,410 --> 02:11:11,120
克里斯托弗  哥伦布
{\rEng}Christopher Columbus.

1278
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:18,380
欢迎光临新世界  舰长
{\rEng}Welcome to the new world, sir.

在大浅滩以南，浮上海面

1283
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,630
潜艇后来…下沉深海

1284
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,560
显然是发生了辐射意外

1285
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,530
部分船员获救

1286
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:39,200
但报导未经证实

1287

苏美两国政府作出声明

1288
