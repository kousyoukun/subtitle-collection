00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:25,026
一艘苏联台风级潜艇

在大浅滩以南  浮上海面

5
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,675
潜艇后来下沉深海

6
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,864
显然是发生了辐射意外

7
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,780

睡一觉吧
You know, if you try and get some sleep...

33
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:03,472
时间会过得快一点

34
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,184
在飞机上睡不着觉  我讨厌乱流
I can never sleep on a plane. Turbulence.

35
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:10,563
-什么?  -乱流

36
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,961
阳光照射地面
Solar radiation heats the earth's crust...

37

热空气上升  冷空气下降

44
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:30,393
你一定不享受这次旅程
I'm not going to ask you how your flight went.

00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:46,284
上次见她还是在你爷爷家
Last time I saw her was at your granddad's place in Maine.

50
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,870
她很好  她向你致以问候

What is she now, three?

53
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:59,797
五岁了  人小鬼大
No, she's a very precocious five.

54
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:02,487
她说
She announced to Caroline...

55
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:05,011
如果我们买一个小弟弟...
and I the other day that her life would be less lonely...

56
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:09,390
她就不会那么寂寞
if we were to buy her a baby brother.

57
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,976
后来她叫我们
But she decided it would be enough...

58
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,395
给斯坦利买个弟弟
if we were to buy one for Stanley.

59
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:20,234
-谁是斯坦利?  -斯坦利是玩具熊
-Who's Stanley?  -Ah, Stanley's a bear.

60
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:27,450
为什么半夜赶乘飞机来这里?
What's important enough to get you on a plane in the middle of the night?

61
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,952
英国情报局两天前获得这些

我不知道那是什么  英国人也不知道
I don't know what they are, neither do the British.

74
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:15,915
也许我们在摩尔曼斯克的朋友会有点头绪
Perhaps our friends in Murmansk have come up with something new.

75

我想请泰勒舰长看看这些图片

现在听到了吗?
You hear it now?

89
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:39,999
等一等  这声音...
Wait a minute. maybe...

90
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,502
-被水面的杂声盖过了?  -是的
-It's buried in surface clutter.  -Yes.

91
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:47,006
-用分析仪?  -对  博蒙特

使用信号分析系统

一星期后  你就可以在学院任教
Give it a week and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

94
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:59,852
像贝多芬一样
So, like Beethoven on the computer...

95
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:11,781
你用电脑创作生物乐章

96
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:15,993
-什么?  -鲸鱼的声音  博蒙特
-A what?  -A whale. Beaumont. A whale...

97
00:11:16,994 --> 00:11:22,208
鲸鱼比你更熟悉声纳
A marine mammal that knows a lot more about sonar than you do.

98
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:27,546
关闭分析仪  转到269方位再听一次

水兵琼斯是个超级音乐迷
Ahem... Seaman Jones here, he's into music in a big way.

106
00:11:55,032 --> 00:12:00,830
他把潜艇当作私人音乐厅
He figures this whole boat is basically just his own personal, private stereo set.

拜托  这是我在讲故事
This is my story, OK?

110
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:11,799
帕瓦罗蒂是男高音  帕格尼尼是作曲家
Pavarotti is a tenor. Paganini was a composer.

111
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:15,907
好  他正在用耳机听音乐
OK. So he's got this music, and he's got it out in the water.

112
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:19,849
正偷着乐呢
He's listening on his headsets, happy as a clam.

113
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,414
后来出事了
Then all hell breaks loose.

All of a sudden, they start hearing...

118
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,882

我是舰长  发现了什么  琼斯?
Captain, aye. What've you got, Jones?

124
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:52,214
正在判别  可能是潜艇
Distant contact, probably submerged.

125
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,872
声音从远处传来
It's a wild guess, but...

126
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:55,363
我相信是巨兽出笼了
I'd say we hit a boomer, coming out of the barn.

127
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:58,346
可能是波利尼湾的导弹潜艇
Could be a missile boat out of Polijarny.

128
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,787
好的  开始追踪  我马上来
Ok. Start your track. I'll be there in a minute.

舰长  是时候启阅命令了
Time to open the orders, sir.

131
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:11,711
那位政治委员已经进了舰长室

132
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:14,505
好
Very well.

133
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:19,260
你留在指挥室
Carry on.

134
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:44,744
-你在干什么?  -监督全体船员的安定性
-What are you doing?  -Overseeing the stability of the crew.

135
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:49,999
所以侵犯我的隐私权?
By invading my privacy?

136
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:55,296
在苏联  私隐权并不重要
Privacy is not a major concern in the Soviet Union.

137
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:59,216
私隐权经常与集体利益相抵触
It is often contrary to the collective good.

138
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:12,313
"看  我像贼一样来临"
"Behold, I am coming as a thief."

139
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,462
"他们聚集在一起
"And they gathered them together...

140
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:18,444
在一个称为善恶决战场的地方"
in a place called Armageddon. "

141
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,406
"第七位天使把碗倒在空中
"The 7th angel poured forth his bowl...

142
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:25,534
天堂传来一个声音..."
and a voice cried out from Heaven..."

143
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:29,330
"成了"
"It is done."

144
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:34,710
你肩负重任  怎能听信末世预言
A man with your responsibilities reading about the end of the world.

145
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:41,217
这是什么? "我是摧毁世界的死亡使者"
And what's this? "I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."

146
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:45,554
一位美国人引述的这段印度古文
It is an ancient Hindu text quoted by an American.

147
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,975
-美国人?  -他发明了原子弹
-An American?  -He invented the atomic bomb.

148
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:52,728
后来被指为共产党员
He was latter accused of being a communist.

149
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:56,524
你在这些句子下面划线  写字
You wrote and underlined these passages.

150
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:59,318
不是
No.

151
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,074
这是我妻子的遗物  我留作纪念
This book belonged to my wife. I keep it for sentimental value.

152
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:08,452
对不起  舰长  尊夫人很漂亮
I'm sorry, comrade Captain. Your wife was a beautiful woman.

153
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,372
她的去世令人惋惜
Her death was unfortunate.

154
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:16,711
我只不过是履行职责
I am only doing my job. It is my responsibility.

155
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:22,133
克格勃派了多少特工到我的艇上?
How many agents did the KGB put aboard my boat?

156
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,198
-你的艇  舰长?  -是的
-Your boat, Captain?  -Yes.

157
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,097
这艘潜艇属于苏联人民
This vessel belongs to the people of the Soviet Union.

158
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:32,685
如果艇上有克格勃或者情报局的特工
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU has agents aboard...

159
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:36,147
我也不知情
I would be the last to know.

160
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:41,986
启读命令吧  舰长
I suggest we open our orders, Captain.

161
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:45,197
好的  同志
Certainly, comrade.

162
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:31,911
红旗北军潜艇部队
From Commander Strategic Submarine Forces Red Banner Northern Fleet.

163
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:37,208
我们向北方  坐标54-90进发
We are to proceed north, to grid square 5490.

164
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,670
与雅夫级潜艇科诺瓦洛夫号会合
and rendezvous with Alfa submarine Konovalov.

165
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,965
图波列夫的艇
Captain Tupolev's boat.

166
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:47,238
你认识图波列夫?
You know Tupolev?

167
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:48,792
我知道他是上层人物
I know he descends from aristocracy...

168
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:50,346
也是你的门生
and that he was your student.

169
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:54,267
据说他特别敬重你
It's rumored he has a place in his heart for you.

170
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:59,981
图波列夫只会敬重他自己
There's little room in Tupolev's heart for anyone but Tupolev.

171
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:04,944
会合后  两艘潜艇一起演习
Having made contact, we are to run a series of drills.

172
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:08,197
图波列夫猎杀我们的潜艇
Tupolev will hunt us while we test our ship.

173
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:12,326
我们测试履带式推进器
We are to evaluate the readiness of the caterpillar drive.

174
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:17,415
然后在本月十六日返回波利尼湾
We return to Polijarny on or about the 16th of this month.

175
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:20,147
舰长  这是一个历史时刻
Captain, This is an historic moment for all of us.

176
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,712
我有一个请求
I should like to make a request.

177
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:25,006
-在提出请求前...  -我知道这不合规矩
-Before you proceed...  -I know it's not protocol...

178
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:27,528
但请让我
but would you permit me to...

179
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,885
向船员公布任务
post our orders and inform the crew of our mission?

180
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:59,290
我要去一个地方  你不能同行
Where I am going, you can not follow.

181
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:30,571
彼得罗夫医生  立刻来舰长室
Dr Petrov, report to my cabin immediately.

182
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,407
这里发生了意外
There's been a dreadful accident.

183
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:44,207
4号码头  美军船坞  马里兰州

184
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,207
接着!
Hey, buddy!

185
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:21,455
下面没有支船架  快点动手
Listen to me. There's no cradle underneath it. Get it over。

186
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:27,003
别那么固执  上来帮我吧
Relax! Stop being an old maid. You want to come up here and do it yourself?

187
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,218
瑞恩  谁让你进来的?
Ryan! Who let you in here?

188
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:38,848
他们叫你来砌模型?
Have they got you playing with models now?

189
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:44,729
该死的  叫他慢下来
Damn it, Phil! Tell them to slow down.

190
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:50,318
这不是模型  这是深潜救助艇
It's not a model. It's a DSRV. Rescue sub.

191
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,944
我知道这是什么  我原来见过一艘
I know what it is. And I just need to see one before.

192
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:53,404
你拿它来做什么?
What are you doing with it?

193
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:56,615
改装入坞设计
Ah, well, we're rigging it with a generic docking collar...

194
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:59,660
它可以配合各国潜艇
so it'll mate with British, German... just about anybody's sub.

195
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:03,122
在24小时内赶到世界每个角落
We can get it anywhere in the world in 24 hours.

196
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:10,755
-你的背没事吧?  -没事  有没有时间?
-How's your back?  -It's fine. Have you got a minute?

197
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:16,886
比常规的台风级潜艇更大  这些是什么门?
It's bigger than a regular Typhoon. What are these doors?

198
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:19,805
你真细心
You don't miss much, do you?

199
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:24,060
它们比鱼雷发射管大
Those are too big to be torpedo tubes.

200
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:26,291
用来发射洲际弹道导弹?
Can you launch an ICBM horizontally?

201
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,356
是的  你想问什么?
Sure. Why would you want to?

202
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:34,070
它们是对称的  排在舰轴两边
They're symmetrical, right down the long axis of the sub.

203
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:36,906
拖曳线阵列声纳呢?
How about a towed sonar array?

204
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:39,575
肯定不是  太靠近螺旋桨了
Nope. Too close to the screws.

205
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:42,870
怎么会...
I'll be...

206
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:45,957
这可能是履带
This could be a caterpillar.

207
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,688
什么?
A what?

208
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:51,254
履带驱动  磁性压水式推进器
Uh, a caterpillar drive. Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

209
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,714
-明白吗?  -不明白
-Do you follow?  -No.

210
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:58,344
它就像水中的喷射引擎
It's like a jet engine for the water.

211
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:00,992
靠向后的反冲推进
Goes in the front, gets squirted out the back.

212
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:03,474
没有运动部件  所以非常的安静
Only it's got no moving parts, so it's very, very quiet.

213
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:06,206
有多安静?
Like how quiet?

214
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:08,771
我们的声纳绝对发现不了它
It's doubtful our sonar would even pick it up.

215
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:10,502
听起来像是鲸鱼游动
And if it did, it would sound like whales humping...

216
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,066
或是地壳震动
or a seismic anomaly.

217
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:15,194
一点也不像潜艇
Anything but a submarine.

218
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:18,823
我们数年前研制这种潜艇
We messed with this a couple of years ago.

219
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:22,285
但未成功
Couldn't make it work.

220
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:24,300
他们成功了?
They really built this?

221
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,149
这不是个模型吧?
This isn't a mock-up or anything.

222
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,999
它今早出海了
She put to sea this morning.

223
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:38,426
十二岁时  我帮爸爸建造防空洞
When I was twelve, I helped my daddy build a bomb shelter in our basement...

224
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:44,682
因为有人打算向佛罗里达州发射导弹
because some fool parked a dozen warheads 90 miles off the coast of Florida.

225
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:49,145
这东西能向华盛顿和纽约  发射二百枚导弹
This thing could park 200 warheads off Washington or New York...

226
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:55,484
而且神不知鬼不觉
and no one would know anything about it until it was all over.

227
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:08,497
-舰长  你没事吧?  -没事
-Are you all right, Captain?  -Oh, yes.

228
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:13,210
被地上的茶水滑了一跤  竟然断送生命
It's just to die for something as petty as slipping on tea.

229
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,587
你不必自责  舰长  这是个意外
You're blaming yourself, Captain. It was an accident.

230
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,798
回基地后你的心情自然会平复
You'll feel better when we put in.

231
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:21,427
-平复?  -嗯  回基地后  舰长
-Put in?  -Well, to base, Captain.

232
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:23,373
我们不能没有政治委员
We cannot go on without a political officer.

233
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:25,552
医生  这是艘苏联战舰
Doctor, this is a combat vessel of the Soviet Navy.

234
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:29,879
而我是个资深舰长
And I'm a senior combat officer.

235
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:34,607
我们不能为这意外撤销任务
We do not cancel operations because of accidents.

236
00:23:34,774 --> 00:23:40,363
水兵  过来  过来
Seaman, come here. Come here.

237
00:23:41,364 --> 00:23:45,826
-你叫什么名字?  -副厨师洛吉诺夫
-Your name?  -Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.

238
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:49,830
好  你和医生来当见证人
Good. I want you and the doctor to witness this.

239
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:53,271
我要解除政治委员的导弹钥匙
I'm removing the Political Officer's missile key carry on...

240
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:56,545
并由我来保管
and I'm keeping it by myself.

241
00:23:56,712 --> 00:24:00,383
舰长  我认为这得请示红旗舰队总司令
Captain, I think we should report this to Red Fleet Command.

242
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,364
这恐怕不行  医生
I'm afraid that's impossible, Doctor.

243
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:06,180
我们必须保持无线电静默
Our orders are for strict radio silence.

244
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:11,561
-你可以走了  -这样不太好  舰长
-That's all, Loginov.  -This is most unnerving, Captain.

245
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:15,585
发出两条钥匙
The reason for having two missile keys...

246
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:19,443
就是为了避免...
is so that no one man may...

247
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:24,782
-避免什么?  -避免一人控制导弹
-May what?  -May arm the missiles.

248
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:27,159
也许我应该控制钥匙
Perhaps I should keep the key.

249
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:29,370
谢谢你  医生  你可以走了
Thank you. That'll be all, Doctor.

250
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:35,209
我将会发布指令  到时候你就会明白
When I address the crew, then you will understand.

251
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:45,553
彼得罗夫  我不会向中央报告你的言论
Petrov, I will try to forget your comments when I present my report.

252
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,889
谢谢  舰长
Thank you, sir.

253
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:59,650
在方位310  速度12节  距离20000码
Holding steady on 310. 12 knots at about 20,000 yards.

254
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:04,864
-有没有资料?  -电脑正在分析
-Have you got a make on it?  -The computer is chewing on it, sir.

255
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:08,326
双螺旋桨  像是台风级潜艇
Twin screws. The plant noise sounds like a typhoon.

256
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,200
是艘新型潜艇  舰长
I'd say we got a new boat, sir.

257
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,338
汤姆  最近几天总部有没有新消息?
Tommy, I miss something on the boards last few days?

258
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:24,258
没有新的潜艇记录
Sub plant hasn't said anything about it.

259
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:31,474
-电脑记录了多少台风级潜艇?  -6艘
-All right. How many Typhoons are listed?  -Six, sir.

260
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,684
好的  称它为"台风七号"
OK. Call this guy Typhoon Seven.

261
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:35,727
靠近点开始监听
Start a tape on him. See if we can work in a little closer.

262
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:37,772
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

263
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:42,610
它会听到我们吗?
Won't he hear us?

264
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,863
潜艇有听觉盲点  博蒙特
Not if we stay in his baffles, Seaman Beaumont.

265
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,992
他们听不见螺旋桨背后的声音
Come in behind his propeller and he's deaf as a post.

266
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:21,669
声纳有新发现吗?
Any sonar contacts, Mr.Kamarov?

267
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:24,902
没有新发现  舰长
No contacts, Captain. The sonar is clear.

268
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:27,238
海面有没有发现船只  鲍罗丁?
Good. Do we have any surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?

269
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:29,407
没有任何目标
No contacts, sir. Scope is clear.

270
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:34,036
好  我要向船员说明任务
Good. Then it's time I explain our orders to the crew.

271
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:38,499
同志们  我是舰长
Comrades, this is your captain.

272
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:41,794
我感到很荣幸
It is an honor to speak to you today...

273
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:44,484
我们驾驶祖国最先进的潜艇
and I'm honored to be sailing with you on the maiden voyage...

274
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:47,008
作首次航行
of our motherland's most recent achievement.

275
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:52,096
我们将再玩一个危险游戏
And once more, we play our dangerous game.

276
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:58,060
跟我们的老对手美国海军  一较高下
A game of chess, against our old adversary the American Navy.

277
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:01,835
四十年来  你们的父亲和兄长
For 40 years, your fathers before you...

278
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:05,443
一直跟他们周旋
and your older brothers played this game and played it well.

279
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,990
但现在情况转变了  我们占有优势
But today the game is different. We have the advantage.

280
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:15,328
我想起我们昔日的人造地球卫星和尤里·加加林
It reminds me of the heady days of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin.

281
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:18,915
我们的火箭令世界震惊
when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets.

282
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:22,585
我们的无声潜艇  也会令世界震惊
It will tremble again at the sound of our silence.

283
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,839
-命令:以无声推进系统潜航  -是  舰长
The order is: Engage the silent drive.  -Aye, sir.

284
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:30,843
-水柜控制  开启外门  -外门开启
Ballast control, open outer doors.  -Yes, open outer doors.

285
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,305
潜水官  关闭主引擎  使用履带推进
Diving command. Engage caterpillar and secure main engines.

286
00:27:38,935 --> 00:27:41,020
正在开门  舰长
Doors opening, Captain.

287
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:45,191
同志们  我们的舰队也不知道我们的威力
Comrades, our own fleet doesn't know our full potential.

288
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:48,152
他们想尽一切办法测试我们
They will do everything possible to test us,

289
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,884
他们最终只会自惭形秽
but they will only test their own embarrassment.

290
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:53,449
我们将撇下其他舰只
We will leave our fleet behind.

291
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:58,120
无声无息地穿过美国舰队的巡逻  穿过他们的声纳网
We will pass through the American patrols pass their sonar nets...

292
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:03,417
进入各大城市  一边听美国摇滚乐
and lay off their largest city and listen to their rock 'n' roll...

293
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:06,671
一边进行导弹演习
while we conduct missile drills.

294
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:13,928
他们最终只会听到我们的笑声
When we are finished the only sound they will hear is our laughter.

295
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:20,560
然后我们驶到哈瓦那迎接阳光和友谊
while we sail to Havana where the sun is warm and so is the comradeship.

296
00:28:21,852 --> 00:28:24,035
冷却系统已经启动
Cryogenic plant coming on line, Captain.

297
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,401
同志们  今天是大日子  我们缔造历史
A great day, comrades. We sail into history.

298
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:38,619
启动履带式推进器
Caterpillar engaging.

299
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:42,164
履带式推进器已启动  舰长
Caterpillar engaging, Captain.

300
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:59,307
-发生了什么事?  -不知道
-What happened?  -I don't know.

301
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,711
左满舵
Full rudder left.

302
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:32,924
领航员  新航向: 250度
Navigator, new course: 250.

303
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,302
好的  新航向: 250
Yes. New course: 250.

304
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:13,130
声纳发现目标  左舷不远处
Sonar contact, Captain. Port quarter. Close aboard.

305
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:17,510
-美国洛杉矶级潜艇  -美国潜艇! 舰长  我们...
-American, Los Angeles class.  -American! Captain, we...

306
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:20,972
航向: 310
Course: 310.

307
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:24,850
美军在跟踪我们?
Is the American turning to follow us?

308
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,563
不是  他们保持原来的航向
No, Captain. The American is continuing in his original course.

309
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:32,984
-他们继续驶向西北方  -他们听不多我们
-He is continuing north-west.  -He can't hear us.

310
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,487
会不会听见歌声?
And the singing?

311
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,295
让他们唱吧
Let them sing.

312
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:12,043
你说什么? 检查仪器
What are you talking about? Check your gear.

313
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:14,025
正在运行诊断程序  舰长
Running diagnostics now, Captain.

314
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:23,993
声纳工作正常  苏联人消失了
The sonar is working, Captain. The Russian disappeared.

315
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,581
听到1分钟  位于坚守4000码外  然后就消失了
One minute he was steady, 4,000 yards off the bow then he was gone.

316
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,754
-我好像听到...  -听到什么?
-And for a second, I thought I heard...  -Heard what?

317
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:39,258
我好像听到歌声
I thought I heard singing, sir.

318
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:43,137
-歌声?  -是的
-Singing?  -Yes, sir.

319
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:49,137
莫斯科  红旗舰队指挥部

320
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:57,693
早上好  长官
Good morning, sir.

321
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:01,739
早上好  长官
Good morning, sir.

322
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:06,410
早上好  长官
Good morning, sir.

323
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:14,502
早上好  长官  昨晚睡得好吗
Good morning, sir. I hope you had a lovely evening.

324
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:18,047
今早有点冷
A little chilly this morning.

325
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,575
马尔科·雷米斯寄了封信来
There's a letter from Marko Ramius.

326
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:48,119
马尔科!
Ah, Marko!

327
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:21,444
喂
Yes?

328
00:33:21,611 --> 00:33:25,281
我是瑞恩博士
No, this is Dr Ryan.

329
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:31,495
-发生什么事了?  -不再是学术研究那么简单
-What the hell happened?  -This is no longer research project.

330
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,274
我找到了那些门的资料
I got a line on those doors.

331
00:33:39,274 --> 00:33:42,048
你知道它们是什么吗?
You know what they are?

332
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:50,264
-无声推进系统  -你怎么知道的?
-A nearly silent propulsion system.  -How did you know that?

333
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:52,910
我们的潜艇曾经发现它
The captain of the sub following her radioed in.

334
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,519
但它消失了
Thing disappeared right in front of him.

335
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:58,439
这还不止  看看吧
And that's only the half of it. Read.

336
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:11,786
-有证件吗?  -真是难以置信
-Got your ID?  -My god, this is unbelievable.

337
00:34:11,953 --> 00:34:16,540
基洛夫级  斯维尔德洛夫级  基辅级  明斯克级
The Kirov, three Sverdlovs, the Kiev, the Minsk.

338
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:18,229
他们出动了整支舰队
They've sortied their whole bloody fleet.

339
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:19,752
看来是这样的
That's about the size of it.

340
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:27,218
-我们去哪里?  -向杰弗里汇报情况
-Where are we going anyway?  -Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt.

341
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:30,638
他是国防顾问
The President's Security Advisor.

342
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,891
大部分参谋长都来了
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there, along with a few other people.

343
00:34:34,058 --> 00:34:38,312
-谁作汇报?  -你
-Who is giving the briefing?  -You are.

344
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:41,106
文员已经给你准备好了幻灯片
The yeoman will have all the slides laid out for you.

345
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:43,734
你只需...
So all you've got to do...

346
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:53,284
没有人比你更了解这件事
Look, no one understands this material better than you.

347
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:58,374
结合现有的资料  向他介绍这艘潜艇
Just give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand.

348
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:02,962
他会单刀直入地发问  你实话实说
He's liable to ask some direct questions. Give him direct answers.

349
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:07,049
谈谈你的想法
Tell him what you think. Come on.

350
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,162
先生们  在过去二十四小时
Uh, gentlmen. The last 24 hours...

351
00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:19,645
苏联海军有不寻常的举动
have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity.

352
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:23,691
这艘初次启航的潜艇被命名为"红十月号"
The first to sail was this ship we believe called the Red October...

353
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:27,445
为了纪念1917年十月革命
in reference to the October revolution of 1917.

354
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:31,240
它是台风级潜艇的变体  有650英尺长
A variant of the Typhoon class, she's 650 feet long

355
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:34,034
排水量是三万二千吨
and 32,000 tons submerged displacement.

356
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:36,662
跟二次大战的航空母舰相等
Roughly the same size as a World War II aircraft carrier.

357
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:41,087
舰首和舰尾的这些门后面...
We believe that these doors here on the bow...

358
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:45,087
...是独特的推进系统
...and again on the stern enclose a unique propulsion system.

359
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:48,758
磁性压水式推进器  又名履带式推进器
A magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar...

360
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:52,803
所以潜艇可以无声无息地航行
that would enable the sub to run virtually silent.

361
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,785
舰长是最受敬重的
It is possible that this new drive system allowed the captain...

362
00:35:55,785 --> 00:35:58,601
资深指挥官  他叫雷米斯...
a man named Ramius, their senior and perhaps most respected commander.

363
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:01,771
有没有他的照片?
Do we have his picture available?

364
00:36:01,938 --> 00:36:04,795
它可以避开战舰的追踪
Allowed Ramius to elude one of our attack boats...

365
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,652
达拉斯号今早尝试跟踪红十月号
the Dallas, which trailed Red October from harbor this morning.

366
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:14,325
如果这推进器真的能无声运作
It is also possible that this drive system, if operable could render...

367
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:19,538
红十月号就可以无视大西洋的警戒网
the Red October undetectable to our Sosus warning nets in the Atlantic.

368
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:24,919
这潜艇会不会是"先发制人武器"
Mr.Ryan. Would you characterize this as a first-strike weapon?

369
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:30,299
有这个可能
Uh, that is a possibility, sir.

370
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:34,914
它可以偷偷地接近对手
It is designed to approach by stealth and to shower its target with multiple...

371
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:37,139
发射核弹头
independent warheads with little or no warning before impact.

372
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:40,976
它是用来开战的
Goddamn thing was made to start a war.

373
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:43,646
说下去  瑞恩先生
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

374
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:45,710
红十月号突然失踪
About the same time the Dallas lost contact...

375
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,608
与此同时
there were additional sailings.

376
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:53,489
波利尼湾列宁格勒和地中海出动舰只
From Polijarny and from Leningrad on the Baltic and from the Mediterranean.

377
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:58,786
58艘核潜艇正驶向大西洋
There are now some 58 nuclear submarines headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

378
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:01,476
今天下午
This afternoon's satellite pass over...

379
00:37:01,476 --> 00:37:04,000
卫星发现波利尼湾的战舰发出热能
Polijarny found heat blooms in the engineering plants...

380
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:06,773
表明  基洛夫级  明斯克级
at the Kirov, the Minsk and...

381
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:09,380
和其它20艘巡洋舰和驱逐舰即将出海
more than 20 other cruisers and destroyers, indicating they were preparing to sail.

382
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:12,049
苏联海面舰队大举出动
This constitutes the bulk of the Soviet surface fleet.

383
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:14,552
格里尔上将  你有什么结论
Admiral Greer, your conclusions.

384
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,056
现在没有足够的资料来作出结论
Well, sir, the data support no conclusions as yet.

385
00:37:19,223 --> 00:37:21,193
太平洋没有军舰
The absence of activity in the Pacific...

386
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:23,164
他们可能只是演习
suggests this could be just an exercise.

387
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:27,106
可能不是演习
Suppose it's not an exercise?

388
00:37:27,273 --> 00:37:31,319
他们可能想挑战北约
Suppose this is the beginning of a move against NATO?

389
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:36,211
我还有些非常敏感的信息
NSA can speak for that, Mr. Pelt. I must emphasize the extreme sensitivity...

390
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,576
绝对不能公开
of this information and that it not leave the room.

391
00:37:38,743 --> 00:37:40,974
在启航前
Before sailing...

392
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:43,205
雷米斯去信给巴度宁上将
Captain Ramius sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin.

393
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:46,959
他是红旗舰队指挥部的主席
Chairman of the Red Fleet northern political directorate.

394
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:49,336
她的叔叔
That's her uncle.

395
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:51,547
-谁的叔叔?  -雷米斯妻子的叔叔
-Whose uncle?  -Ramius' wife.

396
00:37:51,714 --> 00:37:54,884
巴度宁是她叔叔
Padorin is her uncle.

397
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,400
信的内容还不清楚
Now, the contents of the letter are unknown

398
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,099
但是巴度宁立刻和查宁戈总理开会
but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded a meeting with Premier Chernenko...

399
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:08,397
数分钟后  苏联海军开始追寻红十月号
and within minutes of that meeting the Soviet fleet sailed with orders to...

400
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:11,192
目的是击沉它
find Red October and sink her.

401
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:16,614
-击沉它?  -他们要对付的是一个疯子
-Sink her?  -My God. They've got a madman on their hands.

402
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:21,911
如果它驶入海岸范围五百英里  我们只有两分钟时间作准备
Within 500 miles off the coast, we'll have only two minutes' warning.

403
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,719
-今天是23号  是吧?  -什么?
-Today's the 23rd, isn't it?  -What?

404
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,138
-今天是23号吗?  -是的
-Is today the 23rd?  -Yeah.

405
00:38:51,983 --> 00:38:55,486
你个XX的!
You son of a bitch.

406
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:59,240
你个XX的!
You son of a bitch!

407
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,289
你有什么高见  瑞恩博士?
You wish to add something to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

408
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:16,674
我们可以考虑另一种可能性
I was just thinking that perhaps there's another possibility we might consider.

409
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:20,469
雷米斯可能想叛变
Ramius might be trying to defect.

410
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:24,098
-那么你的建议是?  -说下去
-Do you mean to suggest that this man has come...  -Proceed. Mr. Ryan.

411
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:32,273
雷米斯负责训练军官
Look. Ramius trained most of their officer corps...

412
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,903
他可以挑选忠于自己的下属
which would put him in a position to select men willing to help him.

413
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:40,489
他不是俄国人  他生于立陶宛
He's not Russian. He's Lithuanian by birth...

414
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:44,493
由当渔夫的祖父带大
raised by his paternal grandfather, a fisherman.

415
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,206
他没有孩子  没有家累
And he has no children. No ties to leave behind.

416
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:55,379
今天是他妻子首个忌日
And today is the first anniversary of his wife's death.

417
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:58,611
别瞎猜  你只是个分析员  你怎么知道?
Oh. Come on. You're just an analyst. How can you read his mind?

418
00:39:58,611 --> 00:40:01,677
我认识雷米斯
I know Ramius, General.

419
00:40:01,844 --> 00:40:04,179
他是潜艇舰队的传奇人物
He's nearly a legend in the submarine community.

420
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:06,515
他敢于挑战政党
He's been a maverick his entire career.

421
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:09,018
我在外交宴会见过他
I actually met him once at an embassy dinner.

422
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:11,354
将军  你认识雷米斯吗?
Have you ever met Captain Ramius, General?

423
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:22,453
霍利斯上将
Admiral Hollis

424
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:27,453
雷米斯何时到达导弹发射地点?
how long before Ramius could be in a position to fire his missiles at us?

425
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,500
-四天后  -好的  我会向总统汇报
-Four days.  -All right, I'll brief the President.

426
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:38,422
瑞恩博士  请留步
Dr Ryan, would you stay for a moment, please?

427
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:42,802
我叫你实话实说  但这次...
I said speak your mind, Jack, but Jesus...

428
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:57,858
你令将军难以下台
You slammed the door on the general pretty hard, Jack.

429
00:40:58,025 --> 00:41:01,571
-我无意冒犯他  -这我知道
-That was not my intention, sir.  -Oh, yes, it was.

430
00:41:01,737 --> 00:41:04,552
他当众奚落你  然后你回击他
He was patronizing you, and you stomped on him.

431
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:07,368
我认为他应有此报
In my opinion, he deserved it.

432
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:12,623
我是政客  政客会说谎使诈
Listen, I'm a politician, which means I'm a cheat and a liar...

433
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,335
这一刻在吻婴孩  转过脸就抢棒棒糖
and when I'm not kissing babies, I'm stealing their lollipops.

434
00:41:16,502 --> 00:41:21,507
但政客会灵活地听取意见
But it also means that I keep my options open.

435
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:27,263
现在假设你说得对
So let's assume for a minute that you're right...

436
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:34,020
这个苏联人想叛变  我们该做什么?
and this Russian intends to defect. What do you suggest we do about it?

437
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,026
-我们夺取潜艇  -等等
-We definitely grab the boat, sir.  -Hey, wait a minute.

438
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:43,446
这不是一个迷途的米格战机飞行员
We're not talking about some stray pilot with a M.I.G.

439
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:48,576
我们谈论的是价值数十亿美元的苏联国家财产
We're talking about several billion dollars worth of Soviet state property.

440
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:51,224
苏联肯定会追回的
They're going to want it back.

441
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:53,706
派人登上潜艇调查他们
Maybe it's enough then just to get some people on board and inspect it.

442
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:57,960
编个借口... 进行"海岸例行检查"
Call it whatever you want to... a Coastguard safety inspection.

443
00:41:58,127 --> 00:42:01,505
从何着手?
So how do we proceed?

444
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:05,468
通知大西洋舰队的指挥官
First, we need to contact the commanders in the Atlantic directly.

445
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:07,929
如果苏军窥听到我们的命令
The Russians get one whiff of this through...

446
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:10,223
这游戏就结束了
the regular communications circuits, the game is up.

447
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:13,434
我们要制定策略帮助他们
Secondly, we figure out how we can help them.

448
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:18,231
准备随时介入  调停这场风波
We need to devise a plan to intercede, ready to go at a moment's notice.

449
00:42:18,397 --> 00:42:21,087
最后  派人接触雷米斯
The third, somebody's got to go make contact with Ramius...

450
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:23,778
找出他的动机
and find out what his intentions really are.

451
00:42:23,945 --> 00:42:27,031
好  你何时出发?
Okay, when do you leave?

452
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:32,119
等等
Wait a minute!

453
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:36,374
将军说得对  我只是局外人  我是个分析员而已
The general was right. I am not field personnel. I am only an analyst.

454
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,669
你是最佳人选  我不能差遣他们
You're perfect. I can't ask any of these characters to go.

455
00:42:39,835 --> 00:42:43,422
第一  他们不会相信  他们不会凭直觉行事
One, they don't believe them. Two, they wouldn't stake their reputations on a hunch...

456
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:46,968
-而你...  -可以被牺牲
-where as you...  -Are expendable.

457
00:42:48,844 --> 00:42:52,014
差不多
Something like that.

458
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,728
在三天之内证实你的理论
I'll give you three days to prove your theory correct.

459
00:42:57,895 --> 00:43:04,485
否则我们要消灭雷米斯  明白吗
After that, I have to hunt down Ramius and destroy him. Will you do it?

460
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:14,885
坐标54-90  苏联雅夫级潜艇  卡华洛夫号  舰长图波列夫

461
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:23,421
岂有此理
Mother of God!

462
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:27,841
双引擎三分之二全速前进
Secure the masts. All ahead two thirds. Set depth to 900 meters.

463
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:32,094
-发生什么事了?  -关闭舱盖  三分之二速度下潜
-What is it? What's happened?  -Mast secured, helm at 2/3.

464
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:37,393
左转至方位205
Come left, heading 205.

465
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:54,910
命令是七小时前发布的  呆在底下
These orders are seven bloody hours old! Sitting on the bottom.

466
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,289
像个头脑混乱的小孩
Like an addled schoolboy.

467
00:43:58,456 --> 00:44:02,084
-舰长  -超速前进
-Captain?  -All ahead flank.

468
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:07,423
问下工程师反应堆能否推动至105%
Inquire of the engineer about going to 105% on the reactor.

469
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:13,512
七小时了  整支舰队在追捕他
Seven hours! The entire fleet is after him.

470
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,981
到达900米深
Leveling at 900 meters.

471
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:30,780
舰长  工程师说反应堆可推动至105%  但不建议这样
Captain, Engineer reports 105% on the reactor is possible... but not recommended.

472
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:44,502
推动至百分之一百零五
Go to 105 on the reactor.

473
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:52,927
-什么事? 我们去哪里?  -去杀一个朋友
-Captain, what is it? Where are we going?  -We're going to kill a friend.

474
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:57,390
我们去杀雷米斯
We're going to kill Ramius.

475
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:22,039
从没在舰上喝过这么难喝的罗宋汤
If you like borscht, perhaps, but I've eaten better in an oiler's galley.

476
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:27,503
我太太对待应说  这厨子在阿富汗学烹饪?
My wife asked the waiter, "Where did this man learn to cook, Afghanistan?"

477
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,091
然后我们去看芭蕾舞  去看那位像吉赛尔的新舞者
So then we went on to the Bolshoi, the ballet, to see this new girl as Giselle.

478
00:45:32,258 --> 00:45:36,762
那位新舞蹈员真是漂亮  她嫁给工厂经理...
You remember how beautiful she was. She just married a factory manager.

479
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:43,519
医生  有没有最新的辐射测验数据
Excuse me, Doctor. Do you have the figures for the latest batch of radiation tests?

480
00:45:43,686 --> 00:45:46,063
现在要?
Now?

481
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,400
是的
Now.

482
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:55,364
上一次测验的数据也拿来吧  作个对比
Perhaps you could bring the preceding set as well... for comparison.

483
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:58,409
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, Doctor.

484
00:46:15,092 --> 00:46:18,387
他不会这么快回来
It will take him some time.

485
00:46:19,597 --> 00:46:24,477
在开始前  我想了解普金的死因
Before we begin, Captain. I'd like to know exactly what happened to Putin.

486
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:36,656
-他不是真的滑倒吧  -我不喜欢你这样的语气
-He didn't slip on his tea, did he?  -I don't think I like your tone, Slavin.

487
00:46:36,822 --> 00:46:39,227
我们在这儿
What the hell's my tone got to do with it?

488
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:41,632
身处险境
We're risking our lives here.

489
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,038
普金会带来麻烦
Putin could have made complications.

490
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:48,251
你以为他会袖手旁观  成全我们?
Did you think he would go away and sulk while we carried out our plans?

491
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:51,712
他被谋杀?
Are you saying he was murdered?

492
00:46:51,712 --> 00:46:55,007
-老天  -别发牢骚
-My God.  -Stop whining, Yuri.

493
00:46:55,174 --> 00:46:59,053
他就是被谋杀的  他是个混蛋
So he was murdered. I have no problem with that. The man was a pig.

494
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,391
-但我们应该一起做决定  -你不是指挥官
-But it is a decision we should have all made together.  -You are not in command here.

495
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:08,604
如果真相败露  船员会叛变
If the crew finds out, we could have a mutiny.

496
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:11,774
艇上每一件事都会影响我们
Everything that happens on this ship affects us all.

497
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:14,777
纠察长已经起了疑心
The Master-At-Arms is already suspicious.

498
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:20,575
-现在还可以回去...  -绝不能回头
-We could still go back.  -There'll be no going back.

499
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:26,581
启航前  我给巴度宁上将寄了封信
Before we sailed, I dispatched a letter to Admiral Padorin...

500
00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:31,127
我在信内宣布了叛变计划
in which I announced our intention to defect.

501
00:47:32,878 --> 00:47:36,299
我的天  为什么?
In the name of God, why?

502
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:41,137
到达新世界后  科特兹烧掉所有船
When he reached the new world, Cortez burned his ships.

503
00:47:41,304 --> 00:47:46,809
-手下只好跟他一起奋斗  -你把我们置之死地
-As a result, his men were well motivated.  -You have signed our death warrants.

504
00:47:46,976 --> 00:47:52,648
-巴多宁上将会派整支舰队来  -他们会追捕我们
-Padorin will send the entire fleet.  -Jesus! They'll find us.

505
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:57,486
没有人会来找我们  住口吧
Nobody is going to find us. That's enough, Yuri.

506
00:47:57,653 --> 00:48:03,159
把潜艇交给美国是不够的
You had to do it, huh? You couldn't just turn the submarine over to the Americans.

507
00:48:03,326 --> 00:48:07,079
你还要发表政治宣言
You had to make a political statement.

508
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:13,961
背后隐藏着什么心态? 为何不能静静地溜走?
Or was it something deeper, Captain? Something that made you unable to slip away?

509
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:20,635
-是虚荣心作崇吧?  -我们为着不同的原因叛变  维克多
-Was it ego, Captain?  -We each have our reasons, Victor.

510
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:25,431
收到这潜艇的蓝图后  我开始思变
My own began the day I was handed the blueprints for this ship.

511
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:30,228
这潜艇本来只有一个用途  我改变它的用途...
A ship which had but one use. And as for the rest...

512
00:48:30,394 --> 00:48:34,941
我会负上全责
well, those are things that I alone must carry the burden for.

513
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:41,739
安纳托利  你害怕我们的舰队  你应该害怕
Anatoly, you're afraid of our fleet. Well, you should be.

514
00:48:41,906 --> 00:48:47,078
我相信  我们有三分一的胜算
Personally, I give us... one chance in three.

515
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:54,418
要茶吗?
More tea, anyone?

516
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,506
不要了?
No?

517
00:48:58,673 --> 00:49:02,009
你们可以回岗位了
Then you may report back to your posts.

518
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:21,821
听到舰长的命令吧  散会
You heard the captain, dismissed.

519
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:31,747
舰长
Captain.

520
00:49:43,801 --> 00:49:49,473
我不会在他们面前反驳你
Captain, I would never disagree with you in front of the men, you know that.

521
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,352
但这次维克多说得对
But in this case Victor was right.

522
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,482
-不通知莫斯科会比较好  -瓦西里
-It would have been better if you had not informed to Moscow.  -Oh, Vasily.

523
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:04,238
莫斯科不足为患  苏联海军也不难对付
Moscow is not the worry, nor the whole Soviet Navy.

524
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:10,036
我了解他们的战略  我有优势
I know their tactics. I have the advantage.

525
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:16,626
美国人才叫人担心
The worry is the Americans.

526
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:22,089
遇上适当的对手才会成功
If we meet the right sort, this will work.

527
00:50:24,175 --> 00:50:28,804
如果对方性急鲁莽...
We get some buckaroo...

528
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:37,563
有乱流  你不喜欢坐飞机?
Some turbulence. You don't like flying?

529
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,943
这不算是什么  5个月前的乱流那才厉害
This is nothing. You should have been here five months ago.

530
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:46,822
呕吐更是不在话下  我们在日本海遇上雹暴
Talk about puke! We ran into a hail storm over the Sea of Japan, Right?

531
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:51,535
机师吐在挡风玻璃上
The pilot shot his lunch all over the windshield...

532
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:54,372
我往无线电吐
and I barfed on the radio.

533
00:50:54,538 --> 00:50:57,520
一切倾囊而出
Knocked it out completely, and it wasn't that...

534
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,503
那是次重量级呕吐
lightweight stuff either! It was that chunky, industrial-weight puke!

535
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:04,090
要不要吃一点?
You want a bite?

536
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:07,593
下次我会把你的高见记在备忘录中
Next time you get a bright idea, just put it in a memo.

537
00:51:10,593 --> 00:51:14,893
美国企业号  北大西洋舰队  新斯科舍以东

538
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:21,607
-长官  -你可以走了  中尉
-Sir.  -That will be all, Lieutenant. Thank you.

539
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:26,737
-鹰眼那班机怎么样了?  -遇上了强风
-That hawkeye from Weymouth Trap?  -Four wire. Caught a gust over the fantail.

540
00:51:26,904 --> 00:51:31,117
-那还不算太差  -这位先生想见你
-Not bad considering.  -The gentleman is here to see you.

541
00:51:31,284 --> 00:51:34,370
查理  你说什么?
The gentleman? What the hell are you talking about, Charlie?

542
00:51:34,537 --> 00:51:39,417
司令说  穿军服才不会惹人注意
I apologize for the uniform, sir. This is Admiral Greer's idea of a low profile.

543
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:42,816
-你是司令的下属?  -是的  长官
-You work for Jim Greer?  -That's all right, sir.

544
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:46,048
告诉我  到底发生了什么事
Then I imagine you'll tell me what all the hubbub's about.

545
00:51:48,926 --> 00:51:53,848
舰长  你有时间吗?  有个东西你应该去看看
Captain, you got a minute? Jonesy's got something I think you ought to see.

546
00:51:55,141 --> 00:52:00,396
-你去喝点咖啡  叫他们给我送茶来  -好的  舰长
-Martinez, get yourself a cup of coffee. Send me up some tea.  -Aye, Captain.

547
00:52:00,563 --> 00:52:03,858
舰长要一杯茶
Messenger, get the captain a cup of tea.

548
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:13,200
台风七号消失后  我听到歌声...
Captain. Sir, the moment that sub went silent and I thought I heard singing...

549
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:16,745
我听到很微弱的背景声
I heard something in the background, real faint.

550
00:52:16,745 --> 00:52:20,124
等其它潜艇离开后  我录下这些声音
After all those subs took off, I caught it again and got it on tape.

551
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:25,254
用电脑过滤声带  剩下这声音
I washed it through the computer and was able to isolate this sound.

552
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:33,429
电脑认为  这是"岩浆移位"的声音
The computer identified it as magma displacement.

553
00:52:33,596 --> 00:52:38,643
这套软件本来是用来探测地震的
The SAPS software was originally written to look for seismic events.

554
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:42,647
所以  它用地震来解释陌生的音调
When it gets confused, it runs home to momma.

555
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,816
-我不知道你想说什么  -对不起
-I'm not following you.  -Sir, I'm sorry.

556
00:52:45,983 --> 00:52:48,986
以十倍速度再听听
Listen to it at ten times speed.

557
00:52:56,577 --> 00:53:00,706
-这一定是人为的声音  -对
-Now, that's got to be manmade, Captain.  -All right.

558
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:07,421
首次发现目标是9时15分  方位269
The first contact was at 09:15 and the bearing was 269.

559
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:10,257
9时30分的时候  它在这里
At 09:30, it was here.

560
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:12,927
在11时和11时15分又在这两点发现它
I came back to it at 11:00 and 11:15, here and here.

561
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,951
苏联潜艇可以高速驶过
Remember the dispatch we got about Russian sub skippers running...

562
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:18,808
雷克雅内斯海脊
the Reykjanes Ridge at high speeds...

563
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,705
因为他们掌握了海底悬崖的地势
because they had hyper-accurate surveys of the underwater canyons...

564
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:22,436
他们有"红航线一号"
Yeah, Red Route One.

565
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:27,441
-海底悬崖的入口是托尔双峰  -是的
-The front door to those canyons was a formation called Thor's Twins, Right?

566
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:29,944
看看这个
Look at that.

567
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,587
-直驱"红航线一号"  -舰长
-Right into Red Route One.  -Captain.

568
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:51,465
我可能疯了  但我打赌
You may think I'm crazy, but I'll bet that...

569
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:55,177
这是艘新型苏联潜艇
magma displacement was actually some new Russian sub...

570
00:53:55,344 --> 00:53:59,432
它驶向冰岛海岸
and it's headed for the Iceland coast.

571
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,873
恕我直言  钟斯
Have I got this straight, Jonesy?

572
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:06,147
你不信任价值四千万的电脑说是地震
A $40 million computer tells you you're chasing an earthquake...

573
00:54:06,314 --> 00:54:11,652
你要另找答案
but you don't believe it. And you come up with this on your own.

574
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:17,825
-是的  -别紧张  我相信你
-Yes, sir.  -Relax, you've sold me.

575
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:25,708
汤米  计划航线  赶去"红航线一号"
Tommy, I want you to plot us a speed course for the bottom end of Red Route One.

576
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:28,627
进了海底峡谷就无法找到他们
We'll never find him in those canyons.

577
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:31,380
我们先移动到潜望镜深度  但最好先通知总部
First take us to periscope depth. But first we'd better phone in.

578
00:54:31,547 --> 00:54:34,675
遵命  舰长
Aye, aye, Captain.

579
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:44,602
等等  钟斯
Hang on, Jonesy.

580
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:53,069
如果我们能靠近它  你可以追踪它吗?
If I can get you close enough, can you track this sucker?

581
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:59,450
是的  我听过它的声音  它逃不掉的
Yes, sir. Now that I know what to listen for... I'll bag him.

582
00:55:00,826 --> 00:55:04,413
-继续工作  -遵命  长官
-Carry on.  -Yes, sir.

583
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,896
真是荒天下之大谬
That's the craziest notion I've ever heard...

584
00:55:07,896 --> 00:55:11,212
整艘潜艇全体成员都想叛变?
a serving line officer? An entire ballistic missile submarine?

585
00:55:11,379 --> 00:55:15,716
就算只是军官叛变  我也不相信
They can't all want to defect, even if it's only the officers.

586
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:19,428
-他有什么计划?  -计划?
-What's his plan?  -His plan?

587
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:23,057
苏联人连上厕所也会预先计划
Russians don't take a dump without a plan.

588
00:55:23,224 --> 00:55:25,559
高级军官
Senior captains don't start...

589
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,895
不会贸然冒险
something this dangerous without having thought the matter through.

590
00:55:28,062 --> 00:55:30,400
-他将要做什么  直接驶往纽约?
-What's he going to do, he's just going to sail into New York?

591
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:32,400
-可能就这么简单
-It might be that simple.

592
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:35,444
在中情局纸上谈兵当然简单
Things may appear simple in the cubicle at CIA.

593
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:40,825
在北大西洋面对整队苏联战舰  那就复杂了
But in the middle of the North Atlantic they get a bit more complex.

594
00:55:40,992 --> 00:55:44,620
-抽烟吗?  -不  谢谢
-Smoke?  -No, thank you.

595
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:49,125
"海岸例行检查"是行不通的
And I don't think your notion of a few days inspection's going to wash either.

596
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:51,502
我们必须要彻底研究整艘潜艇
In order to be any value, you'd have to tear it apart.

597
00:55:51,502 --> 00:55:53,713
这可能需要几个月
The metallurgy would take a couple of months.

598
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,176
-那我们就扣押潜艇  -船员怎么处置？
-Then we have to keep it.  -What will you do with the crew?

599
00:55:59,343 --> 00:56:03,097
不愿叛变的人会回去告发我们
Ones that don't defect will go back and say we got the boat.

600
00:56:03,264 --> 00:56:09,312
-你打算杀了他们?  -我们不是在打仗
-Or do you plan to eliminate them?  -We're not at war, sir.

601
00:56:09,478 --> 00:56:13,192
我们要想办法不让他们知道
So you have to get them off the boat in such a way...

602
00:56:13,278 --> 00:56:15,192
我们得到了潜艇
that they think we don't have it.

603
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,196
不能让苏联知道我们得到了潜艇
They'll go back and report that we don't have it to their bosses.

604
00:56:19,363 --> 00:56:24,535
否则说什么也没用  对吗?
Otherwise, this whole business is just academic, right?

605
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:26,954
是  长官  我明白你的意思
Yes, sir. I think I see your point.

606
00:56:29,749 --> 00:56:34,503
-你上次睡觉是什么时候?  -很久之前了
-When was the last time you slept?  -A while.

607
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:40,051
-外面的长官会为你打点一切  -谢谢你  长官
-The chief outside will fix you up.  -Thank you, sir.

608
00:56:40,218 --> 00:56:42,637
舰长
Captain.

609
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:50,144
天快亮了  我们在战斗情报中心
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours. We'll be in the CIC.

610
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:55,483
-我们要面对种种危机  -是的
-Things are liable to get a little dicey around here.  -Yes, sir.

611
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:07,912
-你认为他疯了?  -疯得可以
-You think he's crazy?  -Certifiable.

612
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,291
我不想见到他穿军服
And I don't care for him wearing the uniform.

613
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:15,357
看到那戒指吗? 72年毕业  他是海军陆战队成员
Did you see that ring on his finger? The Academy class of '72. A Marine.

614
00:57:15,357 --> 00:57:18,256
不会吧...
You're kidding. How did you...

615
00:57:18,422 --> 00:57:25,304
格里尔告诉我  三年级时  他在直升机上遇上意外
Greer told me. Summer of his third year, he went down in a chopper accident.

616
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:28,891
很惨  机师和队员都死了
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

617
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:32,311
他花了十个月接受牵引治疗  花了一年学走路
That kid spent 10 months in traction and another year learning to walk again.

618
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:37,525
第四年  是在医院念的
He did his fourth year from the hospital.

619
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:43,155
你可以考虑给他一次机会
It's up to you, Charlie, but you might consider cutting him a little slack.

620
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:49,829
反正苏联人会先找到那潜艇
The Russians will find that sub before we get near it anyway.

621
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:15,104
-正在穿越托尔双峰  -很好
-Passing Thor's Twins, sir.  -Very good.

622
00:58:19,483 --> 00:58:23,779
-穿越托尔双峰  -很好  开始进入航道
-Passing the Twins now, Captain.  -Very good. Commence your run.

623
00:58:23,946 --> 00:58:27,158
-拐弯时通知我  -好的  舰长
-Call me when you get to the first turn.  -Aye, Captain.

624
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:31,370
-卡马洛夫  开始进入航道  -遵命  长官
Mr. Kamarov, you may commence your run now.  -Aye, sir.

625
00:58:31,537 --> 00:58:37,877
开始第一阶段  航向: 260  速度: 18节
First leg on my mark. Course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

626
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:40,796
深度: 270米
Depth: 270 meters.

627
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:46,177
五  四  三  二  一
Five, four, three, two, one...

628
00:58:46,344 --> 00:58:48,638
开始
Mark.

629
00:58:48,804 --> 00:58:54,602
下潜命令  航向: 260  速度: 18节
Diving Command, course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

630
00:58:54,769 --> 00:59:01,525
给我秒表和地图  我能驾驶没有窗的飞机
Give me a stopwatch and a map and I'll fly the Alps in a plane with no windows.

631
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:05,112
如果地图够准确的话
If the map is accurate enough.

632
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:29,387
我们进了航道  接近首个弯口
We're in the lane and approaching the first turn.

633
00:59:29,554 --> 00:59:34,475
三十秒后左转到方位195
Come left to course 195 in 30 seconds.

634
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:39,564
上升到200米  保持速度
Decrease depth to 200 meters. Maintain speed.

635
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:45,861
舰长  我们正在接近首个弯口  25秒后转到方位195
Captain, we are approaching the first turn. 25 seconds to course 1-9-5.

636
00:59:46,028 --> 00:59:50,825
加速至26节  重新计算
Increase speed to 26 knots and recompute.

很好  保持航线和速度
Very good. Maintain course and speed.

646
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:51,594
太快了  瓦西里
Too fast, Vassily. Too fast.

647
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:57,183
该用什么速度  图表写得很清楚
Those charts are laid out precisely. So many knots for so many seconds.

648
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:02,480
-这艘船会捱不住的  -说话小心点  斯莱文先生
-This thing handles like a pig.  -Watch your bearing, Mr. Slavin.

649
01:01:08,444 --> 01:01:12,365
十五秒后转向  要减速吗?
15 seconds to turn, Captain. Should we decrease speed?

650
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:16,619
不  准备右转

我们位置正确  下一阶段  34分钟后  抵达海王山丘
We're in the lane. Next leg 34 minutes to the Neptune Massif.

655
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,953
航向: 240
Course: 240.

656
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:14,844
-发生什么事?  -冷却系统故障
-What happened?  -The cryogenic plant.

657
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:20,141
磁石无法降温  履带温度高出了50度
The magnets aren't being cooled. We're 50 degrees above red line.

658
01:02:20,308 --> 01:02:25,146
-如果不关掉它  它会熔化  -关掉它吧
-It's going to melt.  -Kill it, shut it down!

659
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:32,069
-舰长  -发生了什么事?

01:02:51,631 --> 01:02:55,551
舰长  我们必须停下来  修理履带系统
Captain, we will have to stop until we can repair the caterpillar unit.

665
01:02:55,718 --> 01:03:02,058
-那就用普通推进系统航行  -舰长  我们会发出声音
-Negative. We will run on normal propulsion.  -Captain, we will not be silent.

666
01:03:02,225 --> 01:03:08,022
时速改为20节  启动螺旋桨
Make revolutions for 20 knots and engage the propellers.

667
01:03:10,524 --> 01:03:16,822
-是  舰长  -他会把我们害死
-Aye, Captain.  -That man will get us all killed.

668
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:24,580
舰长自有分寸
The captain knows what he's doing.

669
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:32,505
海军行动? 我不了解这些事
Naval activities? I have no knowledge of this.

670
01:03:32,672 --> 01:03:36,801
-我没当过海员  -大使先生
-But then, I never was a sailor.  -Mr. Ambassador...

671
01:03:36,968 --> 01:03:41,847
贵国在北大西洋  有一百艘军舰
You have nearly 100 naval vessels operating in the North Atlantic right now.

672
01:03:42,014 --> 01:03:45,184
贵国的战机  抛下无数声纳浮标
Your aircraft have dropped enough sonar buoys

673
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:48,020
你可以踏着浮标  从格陵兰走到苏格兰
that a man could walk from Greenland to Scotland without getting his feet wet.

674
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,690
我们要试一下吗?
Shall we dispense with the bull?

675
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:55,987
你的表达总是很有技巧
You make your point as delicately as ever, Mr. Pelt. But...

676
01:03:56,153 --> 01:04:01,033
军事演习可能是战争的前奏
And what looks like an exercise could be a prelude to war.

677
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,723
你怎能分辨虚实?
How can we tell the difference?

678
01:04:03,723 --> 01:04:06,247
我们必须派船去监视你们
Prudence demands that we deploy ships to observe yours.

679
01:04:06,414 --> 01:04:09,417
你的政府可能会起了戒心...
Your government should consider that...

680
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:15,381
双方的船舰和战机太过接近
that having your ships and ours in such proximity...

681
01:04:15,548 --> 01:04:21,637
本来就危险  战争就是这样
is inherently dangerous? Wars have begun that way, Mr. Ambassador.

682
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:33,482
我们遗失了一艘潜艇
We have lost one of our submarines.

683
01:04:33,482 --> 01:04:35,818
-遗失?  -它可能沉没了...
-Lost it?  -We fear she may be down, and...

684
01:04:35,985 --> 01:04:39,071
说起来很尴尬
this is most embarrassing, but...

685
01:04:39,238 --> 01:04:45,786
船上的军官  都是高干子弟
Several of the crew, the officers, are sons of high Party officials.

686
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:51,709
其中一位甚至是中央委员的儿子
One is even the son of a Central Committee member. I can't say which.

687
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:58,049
-你们正在进行拯救行动?  -是的
-You're telling me this is a massive rescue operation?  -That is correct.

688
01:05:01,135 --> 01:05:04,722
真遗憾  需要我们帮忙吗?
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

689
01:05:07,058 --> 01:05:11,646
-我觉得...  -进行联合援救?
-I'm not sure that...  -Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

690
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:18,027
非常感谢
That is very gracious of you, sir.

691
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:21,155
我会传达你的好意
I will pass your offer on.

692
01:05:21,322 --> 01:05:24,533
但这次  我们暂时不需要帮忙
But at this time, I think we're doing everything that can be done.

693
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:33,833

Captain.

695
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:54,730
我们根据你的意思制定战略  舰队会找到我们
Our strategy depends on your answer. The entire fleet will know where we are.

696
01:05:54,897 --> 01:05:59,819
舰长  声纳在低空发现一架多引擎螺旋桨飞机
Captain, Sonar. We have just been overflown by a multi-engine turboprop.

战斗岗位!
Battle stations!

701
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,799
还有多久到达海王山丘?

01:06:21,966 --> 01:06:26,596
-多久?  -4分10秒

703
01:06:26,762 --> 01:06:30,808
-要下潜吗?  -太迟了
-Should we bottom the boat, Captain?  -No. Too late for that now.

704
01:06:30,975 --> 01:06:36,731
没时间了  计算参数  准备鱼雷散射
We're out of time. Counter measures. Prepare to launch a full spread.

我们没有空间进行机动
We have no room to maneuver in these canyons, Captain.

715
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:32,787
闭嘴
Shut up!

716
01:07:36,707 --> 01:07:39,689
鱼雷接近反鱼雷  失去目标

01:10:08,067 --> 01:10:13,032
如果他们真的开火  我们早就死了
If they were really shooting at us, we'd be dead by now.

742
01:10:32,474 --> 01:10:36,770
我知道履带出了什么问题

743

缓冲器被破坏
The buffer circuit has been torn out.

744
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:43,360
履带迟早会负荷过重
It was only a matter of time, before an overload shut it down.

745
01:10:43,527 --> 01:10:47,009
你说什么?

01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:50,492
有人知道如何弄坏履带而不被轻易发现
Whoever did this knew how to cripple the caterpillar in a way not easy to find.

747

艇上有内奸
Captain, we have a saboteur on board.

748
01:10:58,083 --> 01:11:02,003
不会是军官  军官不会等到启航后才动手
It can't be any of the officers, They had plenty of time before we embarked.

749
01:11:02,003 --> 01:11:05,924
这一定是水兵干的
Must be a member on the crew.

750
01:11:06,091 --> 01:11:11,138
翻查普金的档案  调查海员身分
Go to Putin's cabin. Check his files for information on the crew.

751
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:13,640
我们可能要提早遣散水兵
We may have to put them off before we planned.

01:11:25,569 --> 01:11:30,699
他已经有办法赶走船员了
We don't have to get the crew off the sub. He would have had to do that.

755

我们只需猜想他下一步要干什么
We just have to figure out what he's going to do.

756
01:11:34,745 --> 01:11:38,624
如何赶走艇员
How is he going to get them off the sub?

757
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:43,086
船员要有离艇的意图
They'd have to want to get off.

758
01:11:44,296 --> 01:11:49,134
船员为什么想离开潜艇?
How do you get a crew to want to get off a submarine?

759
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:53,388
船员为什么想离开核潜艇...
How do you get a crew to want to get off a nuclear sub...

760
01:11:53,555 --> 01:11:57,601

762
01:12:04,608 --> 01:12:10,447
扬基一号  方位270  速度低速  完毕
Yankee One, vector 270. Speed is buster, over.

763
01:12:10,614 --> 01:12:13,075
扬基一号  再说一遍
Say again, Yankee One.

764
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:15,952
熊狐步号太接近部队
A Bear Foxtrot got too close to the group.

765
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:18,664
它和一架F14战机相撞
One of the F-14s crowded him, and they bumped.

766
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:24,294
战机损伤  他们引导它返回母舰
He's losing hydraulic fluid. They're trying to get him back aboard now.

767
01:12:24,461 --> 01:12:27,255
-忙碌的早晨  -嗯
-Busy morning.  -Mmm.

768
01:12:27,422 --> 01:12:32,970
昨晚苏联战舰在东边港口戒备
During the night, Russian attack subs are now stationed off every East Coast port.

769
01:12:33,136 --> 01:12:35,639
我们在这里
We're up here.

770
01:12:35,806 --> 01:12:39,059
新泽西舰队赶到海岸
The New Jersey is moving up the coast...

771
01:12:39,226 --> 01:12:42,145
苏军出动攻击型潜艇
while the Russians, aside from over 100 bear foxtrots, have a row of subs...

772
01:12:42,145 --> 01:12:45,065
和海面舰队
and several surface groups.

773
01:12:45,232 --> 01:12:48,610
-火力强大  -对于一支救援队的话  是的
-That's a lot of firepower.  -For a rescue team, yes.

774
01:12:48,777 --> 01:12:50,403
还有一件怪事
And there's something else strange.

775
01:12:50,403 --> 01:12:52,030
他们不关心声纳探测结果
They're using sonar as if they're looking for something, but nobody's listening.

776
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:55,284
什么意思?
What do you mean?

777
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:57,831
以30节的速度航行
At their speed of 30 knots,

778
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,831
他们的声音大过我女儿的音响  居然听不到
they could run over my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

779
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:05,337
-他们不是寻找雷米斯  他们驱赶他
-They're not trying to find Ramius, they're trying to drive him.

780
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:07,337
-驱赶他到哪里?
-Drive him where?

781
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,926
赶到敌人的地盘
Hounds to the hunters.

782
01:13:13,093 --> 01:13:17,514
这舰长的确会去美国
Your sub captain is going to make it to America, Mr. Ryan.

783
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:20,851
他将会在抵岸前身亡
He's going to die within sight of it.

784
01:13:21,018 --> 01:13:25,731
他的僚机要求准许发炮
His wing man kept requesting permission to fire.

785
01:13:25,897 --> 01:13:31,069
若有人轻举妄动  我们会卷入大战
omebody messes up, we'll be in the biggest naval battle since the Jutland. Jesus!

786
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:36,199
-水温太低  不能弹射  -尝试登上甲板
-The water's too cold to eject.  -Air boss will try to bring him aboard.

787
01:13:36,366 --> 01:13:40,495
-这是什么潜艇?  -巴特·曼库索的潜艇
-Excuse me, sir. What's this sub off by herself?  -Bart Mancuso's boat.

788
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:43,957
他正赶去红航线一号
He's going to the bottom of Red Route One.

789
01:13:44,124 --> 01:13:48,670
他的电脑发现"岩浆移位"
He's had intermittent contact with a magma displacement. He's got this...

790
01:13:48,837 --> 01:13:52,924
岩浆移位? 那不是地震学的问题吗?
Magma displacement? Is that like a seismic anomaly?

791
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:55,906
应该是的  怎么了
I suppose so. Why?

792
01:13:55,906 --> 01:13:58,722
-可否让我登上达拉斯号?  -去干什么?
-Is there a way you could get me on board the Dallas?  -What for?

793
01:13:58,889 --> 01:14:01,787
曼库索找到红十月号
Help Captain Mancuso found the Red October.

794
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:04,686
他什么都没找到  他只是在等待
He hasn't found anything, Jack. He's just waiting.

795
01:14:04,853 --> 01:14:07,188
长官
Excuse me, sir.

796
01:14:07,188 --> 01:14:09,524
无声推进系统经常被误认为...
But this silent propulsion system could easily be mistaken for something...

797
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:13,153
只能坐直升机去达拉斯号
Jack, the only way to get you to the Dallas out there is by chopper.

798
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:18,241
直升机可没有这么多燃料
is to use a chopper turned into a flying gas can.

799
01:14:18,408 --> 01:14:23,455
救援扬基一号的部队准备好了
Excuse me, Admiral. Yankee One is on final. Rescue personnel are in place.

800
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:26,333
提升左翼
Pick up your left wing.

801
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,877
禁止着陆!
Power! Wave off!

802
01:14:29,044 --> 01:14:32,047
座舱弹射!
Eject!

803
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:51,066
这件事  会一发不可收拾
This business will get out of control and we'll be lucky to live through it.

804
01:15:03,787 --> 01:15:06,041
燃料倒是够
The bird's loaded down with enough fuel to get you there,

805
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:08,041
不过达拉斯号可能会离开原地点
but Dallas may not be there.

806
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:10,961
我们正在尝试联系它
We're trying to get message to her.

807
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:13,714
如果它下潜了  如果你要跳伞
If she's gone deep, it's dodgey. If you have to ditch...

808
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:25,434
如果要跳伞  记得拿求生装备
If you have to ditch, don't think about anything but the survival gear.

809
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:31,522
-这种水温  你只能坚持四分钟
-At this water temperature, you'll have about four minutes.

810
01:15:32,192 --> 01:15:37,863
-我会记住的  下次记在备忘录上算了
-I'll try to remember that. Next time, Jack, write a goddamn memo.

811
01:16:10,938 --> 01:16:14,650
-船长睡了?  -是的
-Is the captain sacked out?  -Yeah.

812
01:16:15,817 --> 01:16:19,863
-他怎么样  -他不愿离开
-What about him?  -He won't leave.

813
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:33,085
我见过美人鱼
You know, I've seen a mermaid once.

814
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:37,172
还见过鲨鱼吃八爪鱼
I've even seen a shark eat an octopus.

815
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:41,593
但没见过鬼魅一般的苏联潜艇
But I've never seen a phantom Russian submarine.

816
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:23,697
我们会探测情况
We're emerging from the route, Captain.

817
01:17:23,697 --> 01:17:25,180
缓冲板会按正常程序进行清理
I've ordered a routine clearing of the baffles.

818
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:27,180
在数分钟后转向
We'll be making the first turn in a few minutes.

819
01:17:27,347 --> 01:17:33,437
履带推进系统恢复正常工作
The caterpillar is operational and appears to be running normally.

820
01:17:33,604 --> 01:17:39,484
内奸的事令船员人心惶惶
The crew know about the saboteur and they are afraid.

821
01:17:41,403 --> 01:17:45,365
可以在适当时机利用这心态
Well, that could be useful when the time comes.

822
01:17:47,701 --> 01:17:53,123
十六小时后  会到达拉布拉多海岸
You know, we could make the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

823
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:56,918
那里太冷  船员会冻死
Half of them would freeze before they were rescued.

824
01:17:57,085 --> 01:18:01,131
四十八小时后  到马萨诸塞或缅因州
It's Massachusetts or Maine in 48 hours.

825
01:18:01,298 --> 01:18:04,509
两天
Two days.

826
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:16,104
他们会不会让我住在蒙大拿州?
Do you think they will let me live in Montana?

827
01:18:21,526 --> 01:18:26,615
你想住哪里都可以
I would think they'll let you live wherever you want.

828
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:32,204
好  我会住在蒙大拿州
Good, then I will live in Montana.

829
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:37,167
娶一个肥胖的美国妻子  养兔子
I will marry a round American woman and raise rabbits.

830
01:18:37,334 --> 01:18:40,837
她会为我做饭
And she will cook them for me.

831
01:18:41,004 --> 01:18:44,675
我会买一辆小货车
And I will have a pickup truck.

832
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:51,139
可能还会买一辆旅行车
Or possibly even a recreational vehicle...

833
01:18:51,306 --> 01:18:55,310
开着旅行车穿州过省
and drive from state to state.

834
01:18:55,477 --> 01:18:59,606
-可以这样做?  -是的
-Do they let you do that?  -Yes.

835
01:18:59,773 --> 01:19:04,444
-不必申请?  -无须申请  穿州过省
-No papers?  -No papers. State to state.

836
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:07,823
好  开始转向
All right. Commence your turn.

837
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:17,082
冬天住在亚利桑那州
Well then... in winter, I will live in Arizona.

838
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:22,838
-我需要两个妻子  -至少两个
-Actually, I think I will need two wives.  -Oh, at least.

839
01:19:32,514 --> 01:19:39,271
-目标可能想转向  -是的  方位变了
-Possible aspect change on target.  -Sonar, Concur, change in bearing rate.

840
01:19:42,733 --> 01:19:46,987
-指挥室  疯狂伊凡!  -停车  保持安静
-Conn! Sonar! Crazy Ivan!  -All stop. Quick quiet!

841
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,893
发生了什么  钟斯?
What's going on, Jonesy?

842
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,126
苏联潜艇会突然急转  以探查自己是否被跟踪
Russian captains sometimes turn suddenly to see if anyone's behind them.

843
01:20:01,293 --> 01:20:04,630
我们称之为"疯狂伊凡"
We call it Crazy Ivan.

844
01:20:04,796 --> 01:20:07,465
我们要关掉所有机器
The only thing you can do is go dead, shut everything down...

845
01:20:07,465 --> 01:20:10,135
销声匿迹
and make like a hole in the water.

846
01:20:10,302 --> 01:20:16,934
-还有什么问题?  -大船不能一下子停下来
-So what's the catch? -Catch is a boat this big doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

847
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:22,564
如果我们太近  会被卷进它的船尾
If we're too close, we'll drift right into the back of him.

848
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:28,195
你呢  有什么心愿?
What about you? What do you look forward to?

849
01:20:37,454 --> 01:20:42,960
我再没有这种心情
I have no such appetites.

850
01:20:43,126 --> 01:20:46,964
看看他们能否能听见我们
Let's see if he can hear us.

851
01:20:51,677 --> 01:20:54,179
一定还有事情想做
There must be something.

852
01:21:02,104 --> 01:21:05,274
你想做什么?
What is it?

853
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:12,030
我怀念小时候
I miss the peace of fishing.

854
01:21:12,197 --> 01:21:15,909
宁静地钓鱼的日子
Like when I was a boy.

855
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:24,084
四十年来  我一直航海  海上的战争
40 years I've been sailing at sea. A war at sea.

856
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:33,093
一场没有战役的战争  没有纪念碑
A war with no battles. No monuments.

857
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,680
只有死伤者
Only casualties.

858
01:21:40,058 --> 01:21:44,021
妻子在结婚当日  变成寡妇
I widowed her the day I married her.

859
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:50,694
她去世的时候  我还在船上
My wife died while I was at sea.

860
01:22:09,338 --> 01:22:12,424
找人看守轮机舱
Post guards in the engineering spaces.

861
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:17,429
弄坏履带的人  会做出更严重的破坏
If he can get to the caterpillar, he can get to somewhere more vital.

862
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:23,164
钟斯  他在那里?
Where is he, Jonesy?

863
01:22:23,164 --> 01:22:25,979
目标在我们右舷
Conn, Sonar. Target is now coming out of our starboard baffles.

864
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:30,484
他想回到原来的路线
My read is that he's returning to base course.

865
01:22:30,651 --> 01:22:36,365
-他回到航线210  -他环绕我们
-Concur, he's returning to course 210.  -He went right around us.

866
01:22:36,531 --> 01:22:41,578
等三十秒  然后取消静航
Give him another 30 seconds. Then secure from silent running.

867
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:46,375
我们收到讯息
Captain, here's what we got on the ELF.

868
01:22:48,335 --> 01:22:50,921
-谢谢  -不用谢  长官
-Thanks.  -Aye, sir.

869
01:22:58,095 --> 01:23:01,932
是什么?
What is it?

870
01:23:02,099 --> 01:23:05,185
你绝对不相信
You're not going to believe this.

871
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:19,658
我们要及早返航
Commander, we're approaching no return.

872
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:21,827
达拉斯号没收到信息
Dallas apparently hasn't gotten the message.

873
01:23:21,994 --> 01:23:24,225
-我们要返航  -再等一会儿
-We have to turn back.  -Give it a couple more minutes.

874
01:23:24,225 --> 01:23:26,456
不行  燃料快不够了
Negative. Fuel status says we turn around now.

875
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:30,752
等等  你们没有后备燃料吗?
Wait a minute. Fuel status? You got a reserve, don't you?

876
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:32,983
我有十分钟后备燃料
Yes, sir. I've got a ten minute reserve.

877
01:23:32,983 --> 01:23:35,048
但只有作战时才可动用
But I'm not allowed to invade that except during war.

878
01:23:35,215 --> 01:23:39,970
如果你不让我上潜艇  战争会爆发
Mr. If you don't get me on that goddamn submarine, you might have it.

879
01:23:40,137 --> 01:23:44,308
如果有燃料  我们再等十分钟吧
You got 10 minutes worth of fuel. we stay here ten more minutes.

880
01:23:47,811 --> 01:23:53,275
东边两英里处发现潜艇
Yo! Mount up! Yo, I got a submarine at around 3:00. About two miles.

881
01:23:55,611 --> 01:23:57,946
好  给他戴上工具
Okay, Tony, hook him up.

882
01:23:57,946 --> 01:24:00,282
好的  我们把你放到潜艇下面去
OK, Commander. I'll be lowering you down to the submarine now.

883
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:05,245
希望这东西能把烟当作燃料
Give me eight minutes. Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

884
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:11,293
浮上海面  这家伙要吃苦了
Very well. Surface the ship. Whoever this guy is, he's in for one hell of a ride.

885
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,963
好了  坐下来
Okay, Commander, go ahead and sit down.

886
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:20,302
-有经验吗?  -试过一次  当时风平浪静
-Did you ever do this before?  -Once, on a calm day... off Hawaii.

887
01:24:20,469 --> 01:24:24,056
直升机无法稳定地飞行
The pilot will have a difficult time keeping steady.

888
01:24:24,222 --> 01:24:27,392
拿着这棒  以防电击
Don't take chances getting grounded. Keep that rod in front of you.

889
01:24:27,559 --> 01:24:32,105
旋翼的静电  能点亮芝加哥城
In air like this, the rotors will be putting out enough static to light up Chicago.

890
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:36,735
我预备了潜水员  他可能会坠海
A diver's in the escape trunk in case this guy goes in the drink.

891
01:24:36,902 --> 01:24:40,572
对  这疯子想玩命!
Someone must have a burr up his ass to go for a stunt like this.

892
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:08,934
如果我要把你带上来  我会摇绳子和竖起大拇指
Commander, if I got to bring you back up, I'm going to shake the wire.

893
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:13,981
两手交叉  记住了吗?
I'll give you a thumbs up, like this. Remember to cross your arms.

894
01:25:14,147 --> 01:25:17,317
好的  出发吧
Okay, out you go. Passenger's out the door.

895
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:28,161
乘客出来了  在半空中往前荡
He's halfway down. You're drifting forward.

896
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:35,794
好的  勾着他的绳
All right. Get the hook on his cable.

897
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:40,007
注意  别碰他  他来了
Watch it! Don't touch him. Okay, here he comes.

898
01:25:46,888 --> 01:25:51,226
风太大了  我看不见他
It'd be easier without that crosswind. I can't see him.

899
01:25:53,687 --> 01:25:56,565
别碰他
Don't touch him!

900
01:26:01,153 --> 01:26:05,741
-行不通  -拉他回来吧
-This is never going to work.  -OK. Reel him back in.

901
01:26:12,706 --> 01:26:15,584
托尼  他怎么了...
Tony, what's the hell going on back...

902
01:26:18,462 --> 01:26:21,381
达拉斯号  有没有准备潜水员?
Dallas, have you got a swimmer?

903
01:26:21,548 --> 01:26:26,178
有人在左舷坠海  派出潜水员
Man overboard, port side. Send out the diver.

904
01:26:26,345 --> 01:26:30,349
好的  达拉斯号  我们要走了
Very well. Dallas, we are history.

905
01:26:37,898 --> 01:26:42,152
救下面那位博士  我去逃生舱
Get the doc down here. I'll be in the escape trunk.

906
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:49,242
拿梯子来  打开舱盖
Down ladder. Make a hole.

907
01:27:04,841 --> 01:27:09,554
你好  舰长  我很高兴能上舰
How do you do, Captain? It's a pleasure to be aboard.

908
01:27:11,848 --> 01:27:15,519
我要跟总统说话
I have to talk to the President.

909
01:27:15,686 --> 01:27:19,147
好的  请问为何事?
Of course. May I enquire as to the subject?

910
01:27:20,941 --> 01:27:24,256
看来我们先前的报告不太准确
It seems that the initial reports that...

911
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:27,572
我们的潜艇没有失踪
one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate.

912
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:34,913
该艘潜艇由马尔科·雷米斯指挥
The submarine in question is commanded by Captain Marko Ramius.

913
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:40,585
他陷入精神崩溃的状态
Apparently, he has suffered a kind of mental nervous breakdown.

914
01:27:42,087 --> 01:27:48,343
在出发前  他寄信给巴度宁上将
Just before he sailed, he posted a letter to Admiral Padorin...

915
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:51,388
他宣称  想向美国...
in which he announced his intention to...

916
01:27:53,599 --> 01:27:56,643
发射导弹
to fire his missiles on the United States.

917
01:27:58,312 --> 01:28:01,064
上次为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met?

918
01:28:01,231 --> 01:28:03,566
莫斯科不会
In my position I'm sometimes compromised...

919
01:28:03,566 --> 01:28:05,902
告诉我所有事情
by the fact Moscow doesn't always tell me everything.

920
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:10,866
你们的潜艇舰长疯了? 你要我们怎么做?
So one of your submarine captains has gone insane? What do you want from us?

921
01:28:11,033 --> 01:28:14,369
需要你们帮个忙
You offered your assistance.

922
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:17,706
本来是个营救行动  现在你让我们帮你除掉他
That was a rescue mission. Now you want us to help you hunt him down and kill him.

923
01:28:19,124 --> 01:28:24,171
我奉命来请贵国总统帮忙
I have been instructed to ask your president for precisely that.

924
01:28:24,338 --> 01:28:29,718
我们已经找到他  但我们要为你停下来
Find him? We already found him. We had to break off to pick you up.

925
01:28:29,885 --> 01:28:34,139
-喝杯咖啡  还是抽支烟?  -我不抽烟
-Coffee. A cigarette?  -I don't smoke.

926
01:28:34,306 --> 01:28:39,102
假设我们找到他  然后怎么办?
Assuming we can find him, just what exactly am I supposed to do about it?

927
01:28:39,269 --> 01:28:43,523
舰长  通讯室报告  收到紧急讯号
Captain, radio. We're receiving flash traffic on the emergency circuit.

928
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:45,859
好的  翻译它
Very well. Bring it down.

929
01:28:47,444 --> 01:28:50,155
瑞恩先生
Well, Mr. Ryan?

930
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:56,411
-大副  让我们单独谈谈  -雷纳德  过来
-Chief, excuse us for a second.  -Leonard, come on out of there.

931
01:29:02,793 --> 01:29:05,796
我们在追踪红十月号
The sub we're after is called the Red October.

932
01:29:05,796 --> 01:29:08,799
舰长是马尔科·雷米斯
She's under the command of a man named Ramius.

933
01:29:08,966 --> 01:29:11,739
他和艇上部分军官
Now, there's the possibility that he and a good portion...

934
01:29:11,739 --> 01:29:14,513
可能想叛变
of his crew are attempting to defect.

935
01:29:16,932 --> 01:29:19,851
叛变?
Defect?

936
01:29:20,018 --> 01:29:22,145
对不起
Excuse me.

937
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,247
-那潜艇叫红十月号?  -对
-You say the boat's called the Red October?  -That's right.

938
01:29:41,247 --> 01:29:43,875
-舰长是雷米斯?  -对
-Skipper's Ramius?  -Right.

939
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:49,214
看来形势转变了  瑞恩
It seems that circumstances have changed somewhat, Mr. Ryan.

940
01:29:56,179 --> 01:30:00,309
-给他干衣服  我在指挥台等他  -遵命  舰长
-Get this man some dry clothes. I'll be in the conn.  -Aye, sir.

941
01:30:00,475 --> 01:30:02,852
"苏军潜艇红十月号舰长
"National Command Authority informed Soviet typhoon class submarine...

942
01:30:02,852 --> 01:30:05,230
马尔科·雷米斯
Red October Marko Ramius...

943
01:30:05,397 --> 01:30:10,152
可能叛变  准备擅自发射导弹"
is potential renegade and threatens independent missile launch.

944
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:13,509
"你有权采取任何行动
"You are authorized to use any necessary force...

945
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:16,700
防止它接近美国海岸"
to prevent said submarine from approaching the coast of the United States."

946
01:30:31,048 --> 01:30:35,969
左转10度  航向265
Left 10 degrees rudder steady on course 265.

947
01:30:39,806 --> 01:30:42,684
舱内亮红色灯
Chief of the Watch, rig for red.

948
01:30:52,986 --> 01:30:55,468
-什么事?  -已部署好战斗岗位
-What's going on?  -Battle stations are manned and ready, Captain.

949
01:30:55,468 --> 01:30:57,950
很好
Very well.

950
01:30:58,116 --> 01:31:01,223
舰长  我要跟你谈谈
Captain, I have to talk to you.

951
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:04,331
现在不行  潜至一千二百英尺  俯倾20度
Not now. Tommy, make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down angle.

952
01:31:04,498 --> 01:31:09,836
潜水官  潜至一千二百英尺  俯倾20度
Diving officer, make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down.

953
01:31:10,003 --> 01:31:15,884
全速下潜
Full dive on fair water planes. Full dive on stern planes.

954
01:31:18,762 --> 01:31:22,599
450英尺  潜至1200英尺
Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

955
01:31:22,766 --> 01:31:25,519
500英尺
500.

956
01:31:26,895 --> 01:31:29,690
600英尺
600.

957
01:31:29,856 --> 01:31:33,151
700英尺
700.

958
01:31:36,947 --> 01:31:40,575
-一切顺利?  -是的  舰长
-Did you get a good fix?  -Yes, Captain.

959
01:31:47,165 --> 01:31:52,129
-钟斯  发现他了吗?  -很微弱  舰长  正在监听
-Sonar, conn, have you got him yet, Jonesy?  -Very faint, sir. Hold on.

960
01:31:53,672 --> 01:31:58,176
250方位  发现台风七号  在我们预想的位置
Yes, sir. Contact typhoon seven on bearing 250. Right where he's supposed to be.

961
01:31:58,343 --> 01:32:02,889
-他有否发觉我们?  -没有
-Any sign he's alerted to our presence?  -No. Operating as before.

962
01:32:03,056 --> 01:32:08,145
左转到265  溜到他们背后
Come left to 265. Bring us up behind him quietly, Tommy.

963
01:32:08,312 --> 01:32:10,897
再下潜五百英尺
Make your depth 500 feet.

964
01:32:20,073 --> 01:32:23,493
舰长  让我说两分钟
Please listen to me. Two minutes, that's all.

965
01:32:25,495 --> 01:32:29,750
-导航  何时能进入它的航道?  -四分钟后
-Plot, time to intercept his track.  -Four minutes, Captain.

966
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:33,253
好吧  给你两分钟  瑞恩
Very well, Mr. Ryan. Two minutes.

967
01:32:39,843 --> 01:32:43,764
那些指示很合理  但实情是...
I understand that message, it makes perfect sense. But the situation is...

968
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:46,266
雷米斯想叛变
Ramius intends to defect.

969
01:32:46,266 --> 01:32:48,602
所以苏军一直想击沉他
The Russians know this, which is why they've tried to sink him...

970
01:32:48,769 --> 01:32:51,021
-但他们无能为力  -发炮程式准备好了
-but they haven't been able to. So... -I have a firing solution.

971
01:32:51,021 --> 01:32:53,273
很好
Very well.

972
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,546
舰长  听我说
Captain, you have to listen to me.

973
01:32:55,546 --> 01:32:57,653
苏军想要不惜一切代价阻止雷米斯叛变
The Russians will stop at nothing to prevent Ramius from defecting.

974
01:32:57,819 --> 01:33:00,676
所以他们骗我们说他疯了
They've invented this story that he's crazy...

975
01:33:00,676 --> 01:33:03,533
想让我们击沉他
because they need us to sink him before he can contact us.

976
01:33:05,869 --> 01:33:11,416
启动保安系统  我不想鱼雷反过来对付我们
Weapons control, I want full safeties. I don't want this fish coming back.

977
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:14,836
舰长  我认识这个人
Captain, I know this man.

978
01:33:15,879 --> 01:33:18,840
他有没有做"疯狂伊凡"?
Has he made any Crazy Ivans?

979
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,802
-那有什么关系  -下一次是右转
-What difference does that make?  -His next one will be to starboard.

980
01:33:21,969 --> 01:33:26,932
因为过了三十分  他总会右转
Because he goes to starboard in the bottom half of the hour.

981
01:33:29,726 --> 01:33:32,604
调整1号2号鱼雷管  准备发炮
Flood tubes one and two. Warm up the weapons.

982
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:35,317
舰长  设法跟他联络吧
Captain, find a way to establish contact without violating orders.

983
01:33:35,321 --> 01:33:37,317
他想叛变!
He wants to defect!

984
01:33:37,484 --> 01:33:42,489
叫沃森拿枪到指挥室来
Mr. Thompson, Call Chief Watson to the conn with his sidearm.

985
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:50,914
声纳讯号转变  目标方位变化
Conn, Sonar. Signal to noise ratio's dropping. Possible aspect change in target.

986
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:54,418
目标可能在移动
Possible target zig based on bearing rate.

987
01:33:55,585 --> 01:33:58,171
疯狂伊凡
Conn, Sonar. Crazy Ivan!

988
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:05,470
舰长  他转过来了
Captain, he's turning.

989
01:34:08,849 --> 01:34:12,686
-他向哪边转?  -右转
-Which way is he turning, Jonesy?  -To the starboard, sir!

990
01:34:12,853 --> 01:34:16,565
给他个机会
Give the man a chance.

991
01:34:18,483 --> 01:34:21,403
-全速后退  -舰长  再说一遍
-All back full.  -Captain, say again.

992
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:24,865
-全速后退!  -是  长官
-I said all back full!  -Back full. Aye, sir.

993
01:34:29,661 --> 01:34:35,626
-水里形成空洞  他会听见我们  -停车
-Captain, we're cavitating! He can hear us.  -Conn, aye. All stop.

994
01:34:36,335 --> 01:34:38,879
我们暴露了行踪
All right. We just unzipped our fly.

995
01:34:39,046 --> 01:34:44,217
开启外门  准备开火
Mr. Thompson, open the outer doors. Firing point procedures.

996
01:34:44,384 --> 01:34:48,513
只要他有任何异动  我会立刻发炮
Now, if that bastard so much as twitches, I'm going to blow him right to Mars.

997
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,433
停车  回舵到0度
All stop rudder amid ship.

998
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,978
能否辨认对方?
Can you identify the contact?

999
01:34:55,145 --> 01:34:57,772
美国洛杉矶级潜艇  方位: 015  距离: 300米
American Los Angeles-class attack submarine. Bearing: 015. Range: 300 metres.

1000
01:34:57,772 --> 01:35:00,400
舰长  瞬时金属声
Captain, sharp metallic transients.

1001
01:35:00,567 --> 01:35:03,278
他可能想打开鱼雷盖
He may be trying to open his torpedo tube doors.

1002
01:35:03,445 --> 01:35:06,657
外门开启了  准备开火
Outer doors are open on tubes one and two. We're ready to shoot.

1003
01:35:06,823 --> 01:35:11,328
好  我的命令很明确
Very well. My orders are specific, Mr. Ryan.

1004
01:35:11,495 --> 01:35:14,581
他开了外门  准备开火
Captain, he has opened his outer doors. He's preparing to fire.

1005
01:35:14,748 --> 01:35:19,586
调整3号4号鱼雷管  准备开火
Flood tubes three and four and plot a solution.

1006
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,549
要不要打开鱼雷盖?
Shall I open the torpedo tube doors, sir?

1007
01:35:27,511 --> 01:35:32,849
-舰长  要开启外门吗?  -不
-Captain, shall I open outer doors?  -No.

1008
01:35:33,016 --> 01:35:36,812
用电脑记下发炮程序
Lock the firing solution into the computer.

1009
01:35:36,979 --> 01:35:40,023
千万不要开门
Do not open the doors.

1010
01:35:46,321 --> 01:35:52,286
是  舰长  向电脑输入发炮程序
Aye, Captain. Lock solution into computer.

1011
01:35:52,452 --> 01:35:57,499
-目标准备了鱼雷管  -他有没有开外门?
-Conn, Sonar. Target has flooded his tubes.  -Has he opened his outer doors?

-Target is coming shallow.  -What does that mean?

1014
01:36:09,553 --> 01:36:12,723
这位苏联人很聪明
It means he's a very cool customer, your Russian.

1015
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:14,738
他知道我们已经准备好发炮

他不想煽动我们发炮
He's not provoking us.

1017
01:36:16,587 --> 01:36:18,437
他上浮至潜望镜深度观察情况
He's heading to periscope depth to see what's on the surface.

1018

-他在什么方位?  -270  向着西面

-武器情况如何?  -准备好了
-Weapons status?  -Weapons are on.

3号和4号鱼雷准备好了  但外门未开启
Tubes three and four are flooded, but outer doors are closed.

1027
01:37:20,037 --> 01:37:21,937
记录此位置
Mark this bearing.

1028
01:37:29,883 --> 01:37:36,139
你想跟他谈话吗? 他在这儿  你想说什么?

-是他在看潜望镜吗?  -可能是吧
-Will he be the only one looking through the periscope?  -Probably.

1030

我要冒险一试
We'll have to chance that.

"听说阁下想发射导弹"

"别接近美国海岸线  否则我们会进攻"
"Do not approach US coast or you will be attacked."

他可否以一下声响示意?
Can he acknowledge with a single ping?

1035
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:07,629
可以  但他会答复吗?

1039
01:38:35,157 --> 01:38:39,202
好  "如要叛变"

1040
01:38:45,959 --> 01:38:50,631
我要一张航海图
Chart. I need a chart.

1041
01:38:52,716 --> 01:38:57,512
我们在哪里? 一个水深的地方...
OK. Where the hell are we? Someplace deep. Someplace deep...

1042
01:38:58,212 --> 01:38:59,632

Tell me one thing. How did you know he was going to go to starboard?

1046
01:39:19,785 --> 01:39:25,248
我不知道  我想碰碰运气来打断你  对不起
I didn't. I had a 50-50 chance and I needed a break. Sorry.

1047
01:39:27,084 --> 01:39:30,587
不要紧  很久没使用摩斯密码...
That's all right, Mr. Ryan. My Morse is so rusty...

1048
01:39:30,754 --> 01:39:35,217
我可能发出了美女三围数字

这是什么意思?
What the hell is this about?

1054
01:40:19,011 --> 01:40:24,766
苏联人希望我们击沉它  我们可能真的要这么做了
The Russians want us to sink her. We might have to do that.

1055

1135
01:53:19,917 --> 01:53:23,170
什么事这么好笑?
What's so funny?

1136
01:53:23,337 --> 01:53:27,341
舰长说你像牛仔
The captain thinks you're some sort of cowboy.

1137
01:53:27,507 --> 01:53:35,182
-你会俄语  -会一点
-You speak Russian.  -A little.

1138
01:53:35,349 --> 01:53:41,480
知己知彼  百战百胜
It's wise to study the ways of one's adversary.

1139
01:53:41,647 --> 01:53:43,732
说得对
It is.

1140
01:53:45,734 --> 01:53:50,697
你还记得吗  我们在列宁格勒领事馆见过面
I doubt you'd remember, but we met once at the consulate in Leningrad.

1141
01:53:50,864 --> 01:53:56,453
尊夫人的事  我很难过
Along with your wife. I'm very sorry.

1142
01:53:56,620 --> 01:54:01,375
为什么无故向我的船发炮?
What gives you the right to fire on my ship?

1143
01:54:01,541 --> 01:54:05,796
-你的讯息没有提及鱼雷  -瑞恩
-Your signal said nothing of a torpedo.  -Ryan.

1144
01:54:07,047 --> 01:54:09,862
我们要误导你的船员
It was necessary to maintain the illusion for your crew.

1145
01:54:09,862 --> 01:54:12,678
他们会获救吗?
My crew are being rescued, yes?

1146
01:54:12,844 --> 01:54:16,807
救援行动已开始
As we speak.

1147
01:54:18,934 --> 01:54:24,022
-是你发的讯号?  -是的
-You sent the signal?  -That's correct, sir.

1148
01:54:24,189 --> 01:54:30,112
你怎么知道我们的反应堆事故是假的?
Then how did you know our reactor accident was false?

1149
01:54:30,279 --> 01:54:33,407
我循常理推测的
That was a guess, but it seemed logical.

1150
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,833
很好
Very well.

1151
01:54:45,502 --> 01:54:51,091
我把弹道导弹潜艇红十月号交出来
I present to you the ballistic missile submarine Red October.

1152
01:54:55,304 --> 01:55:01,852
我和军官们要求美国庇护
My officers and I request asylum in the United States of America.

1153
01:55:04,229 --> 01:55:09,693
幸会  我是达拉斯号的巴特·曼库索舰长
It's a pleasure, sir. Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1154
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:14,635
鱼雷  美国人又开火了
Torpedo. The Americans are shooting at us again.

1155
01:55:14,635 --> 01:55:18,067
声调太高了  这是苏联鱼雷
The pitch is too high. The torpedo's Russian.

1156
01:55:18,137 --> 01:55:21,388
还有鱼雷? 从哪里来
What do you mean another torpedo? Where the hell did it come from?

1157
01:55:21,455 --> 01:55:25,459
指挥室  声纳发现苏联雅夫级潜艇  呼号4-1
Conn, Sonar. New contact. Sierra 4-1. Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1158
01:55:28,795 --> 01:55:32,111
声纳  为何不引爆?
Sonar, why don't I have a detonation?

1159
01:55:32,111 --> 01:55:33,727
目标距离太近
The weapon enabled on the far side of the target.

1160
01:55:33,731 --> 01:55:35,427
鱼雷来不及引爆
It passed Red October before arming.

1161
01:55:35,594 --> 01:55:39,640
你计算错误  重新装填  以正确参数重新发射鱼雷
You had the wrong range. Fire again with the right setting and reload both tubes.

1162
01:55:39,806 --> 01:55:44,770
加强能源  叫深海救助艇离开
Get me power, and get that damn thing off my boat.

1163
01:55:44,937 --> 01:55:50,233
-有人向我们发射鱼雷  -混帐  走吧
-I think somebody shot a torpedo at us.  -No shit, Buckwheat. Get out of here.

1164
01:55:58,575 --> 01:56:02,996
舰长正在与他们交战
The captain is fighting them.

1165
01:56:05,874 --> 01:56:09,086
鲍罗丁  负责火控
Borodin, fire control.

1166
01:56:09,253 --> 01:56:14,091
-瑞恩  坐在这里  -我不是海军  我是中情局人员
-Ryan, sit here.  -I'm not a naval officer. I'm with the CIA.

1167
01:56:14,258 --> 01:56:18,470
-中情局?  -我只是为他们写书
-CIA?  -I'm not an agent. I just write books for the CIA.

1168
01:56:19,763 --> 01:56:22,849
不管这些  坐下来  照我的吩咐做
Whatever. Sit down. And do exactly what I tell you.

1169
01:56:23,016 --> 01:56:26,520
深潜救助艇已离开  苏联雅夫级潜艇在右舷八千码外
DSRV's away. There's a Russian alfa 8,000 yards to starboard.

1170
01:56:26,687 --> 01:56:32,901
-看来是科诺瓦洛夫号  -超速前进
-Captain, I think it's the Konovalov.  -Increase to flank.

1171
01:56:33,027 --> 01:56:38,031
-超速前进  怎么操作?  -这个旋钮  向右扭死
-Increase to flank. How?  -That knob. Turn right full.

1172
01:56:38,198 --> 01:56:42,244
-超速前进  右满舵  -他再次开火
-All ahead flank. Right full rudder.  -He's shooting again, sir.

1173
01:56:42,411 --> 01:56:45,581
部署战斗岗位
Put battle stations.

1174
01:56:50,586 --> 01:56:55,299
-鱼雷发射  方位315  -距离700码
-Torpedo in the water. Bearing 315.  -Make range 7,000 yards.

1175
01:56:55,465 --> 01:57:01,930
-右转到方位315  -朝着鱼雷冲过去
-Steer right 315.  -That's heading into the torpedo.

1176
01:57:02,097 --> 01:57:08,437
-距离六千码  -右转到方位315
-Estimate range 6,000 yards.  -Steer right 315.

1177
01:57:08,604 --> 01:57:12,858
不  瑞恩  千万别转方向  我们冲向鱼雷
No, that's wrong! Ryan, don't turn that goddamn wheel.

1178
01:57:13,025 --> 01:57:16,278
航向315
315.

1179
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:30,709
-你想冲向鱼雷  -是的
-You're heading straight for that torpedo.  -Yes.

1180
01:57:30,876 --> 01:57:34,880
-什么?  -他冲向鱼雷
-Doing what?  -He's turned into the torpedo's path.

1181
01:57:35,047 --> 01:57:37,591
-什么?  -红十月号直接冲向鱼雷  长官
-What?  -Red October's turned directly into the torpedo's path, sir.

1182
01:57:37,591 --> 01:57:40,135
-他直接冲向鱼雷  -我的天
-Red October's turned directly into the torpedo's path, sir.  -Mother of God!

1183
01:57:40,302 --> 01:57:44,848
鱼雷在方位315  距离: 5000码
Torpedo steady, bearing 315. Range: 5,000 yards.

1184
01:57:45,015 --> 01:57:49,019
-再加速  -不行  我们已推动至110%
-Melekhin, more speed.  -Negative. We're already at 110%.

1185
01:57:49,186 --> 01:57:54,816
-那就以115%推进  -估计距离: 300码  快速接近中
-Then give it run at 115%.  -Estimate range: 3,000 yards. Closing awfully fast.

1186
01:58:01,531 --> 01:58:03,043
他想冲向鱼雷...
He's heading right at the torpedo.

1187
01:58:03,043 --> 01:58:04,555
自杀
What's he trying to do, kill himself?

1188
01:58:04,555 --> 01:58:06,067
我们能否
We have a firing solution...

1189
01:58:06,067 --> 01:58:07,579
向苏联雅夫级潜艇开火?
on the Russian alfa. Can we shoot back?

1190
01:58:07,746 --> 01:58:12,501
他们没有向我们开火  我不能擅自向苏联潜艇开火
They didn't shoot at us. I can't attack a Soviet submarine without authorization.

1191
01:58:15,128 --> 01:58:20,717
鱼雷方位315  当前距离: 900码
Torpedo bearing steady at 315. Last range: 900 yards.

1192
01:58:20,884 --> 01:58:25,138
鱼雷20秒后命中
Torpedo impact: 20 seconds.

1193
01:58:26,431 --> 01:58:30,602
-什么书?  -你说什么?
-What books?  -Pardon me?

1194
01:58:30,769 --> 01:58:36,275
-你写过什么书?  -我写过哈尔西上将的传记
-What books did you write?  -A biography on Admiral Halsey...

1195
01:58:36,441 --> 01:58:43,031
-关于海军战斗战略的  -我看过那本书
-called The Fighting Sailor, about naval combat tactics.  -I know this book.

1196
01:58:43,198 --> 01:58:48,078
你的结论错了  哈尔西战术失当
Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.

1197
01:58:48,245 --> 01:58:53,333
九  八  七  六...
Nine, eight, seven, six...

1198
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:59,339
五  四  三  二...
five, four, three, two...

1199
01:58:59,506 --> 01:59:02,759
鱼雷现在命中目标
Torpedo impact... now.

1200
01:59:12,102 --> 01:59:15,939
我的天
I'll be dammed.

1201
01:59:16,106 --> 01:59:20,611
-怎么了?  -这是战略
-What happened?  -Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

1202
01:59:20,777 --> 01:59:22,825
舰长将射程缩短了
By turning into the torpedo,

1203
01:59:22,877 --> 01:59:26,825
鱼雷来不及引爆
the captain closed the distance before it could arm itself.

1204
01:59:26,992 --> 01:59:29,828
-没事了?  -还不一定
-So that's it?  -Not quite.

1205
01:59:29,995 --> 01:59:33,623
图波列夫舰长会解除武器安全系统
Right now, Captain Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons.

1206
01:59:33,623 --> 01:59:37,252
他不会重蹈覆辙
He won't make the same mistake twice.

1207
01:59:37,419 --> 01:59:42,758
-瓦西里  发炮程式准备好了?  -还没完全准备好...
-Vasily, have you plotted a solution yet?  -It's a little rough, but I...

1208
01:59:49,264 --> 01:59:52,392
-枪声  -听起来好像是的  长官
-Gunfire.  -That's what it sounded like, sir.

1209
01:59:52,559 --> 01:59:56,396
-他不会改变主意?  -是船员作怪
-He won't change his mind, Mr. Ryan.  -It's one of the crew.

1210
01:59:56,563 --> 02:00:00,400
不管他是谁  他有二心
Well, Whoever he is, I'd say he's having second thoughts.

1211
02:00:16,416 --> 02:00:19,836
我想看看蒙大拿
I would like to have seen Montana.

1212
02:00:32,933 --> 02:00:35,957
舰长  他跑进导弹库
Captain, he stumbled forward into the missile bay.

1213
02:00:35,957 --> 02:00:38,981
20号舱响起警报
There's a silo hatch warning... port side, number 20.

1214
02:00:39,147 --> 02:00:43,318
-他不能发射导弹吧?  -不能  但是他能够引爆导弹
-He can't launch a missile?  -No, but he can blow one up.

1215
02:00:45,529 --> 02:00:48,617
舰长  守着指挥台
Captain, take the conn. Fire control's blasted to hell.

1216
02:00:48,629 --> 02:00:50,617
躲在他后面吧
Get in behind him and stay there.

1217
02:00:50,784 --> 02:00:53,495
舰长  慢着
Captain, wait.

1218
02:00:56,164 --> 02:00:59,293
你可能需要这个  舰长
You may need this, sir.

1219
02:01:02,004 --> 02:01:04,298
谢谢
Thank you.

1220
02:01:06,925 --> 02:01:09,907
别光站着  跟着他  拿着家伙过去
Don't just stand there, Ryan, go with him!

1221
02:01:09,907 --> 02:01:11,398
-你会说英语?  -是的
-You, you speak English?  -Yes, sir.

1222
02:01:11,398 --> 02:01:12,889
你也跟着去
get your butt over here.

1223
02:01:13,056 --> 02:01:16,393
舰长  鱼雷未命中
Captain, torpedo broke off on impact.

1224
02:01:16,393 --> 02:01:18,061
妈的  解除鱼雷保险
Goddamn it! Set the safety ranges for zero now.

1225
02:01:18,061 --> 02:01:19,730
舰长  我已经尽快在弄了
Captain, I can't go any faster.

1226
02:01:19,896 --> 02:01:24,443
千万不能让他破坏点火电路
We must get him before he gets to the ignition circuits.

1227
02:01:31,575 --> 02:01:35,120
破坏点火电路会有什么后果?
What happens if he gets to that ignition circuitry?

1228
02:01:35,287 --> 02:01:38,290
他会烧毁整艘潜艇
He can incinerate the ship.

1229
02:01:45,672 --> 02:01:50,344
-这个门是唯一出口?  -是的
-That door is the only way out of here?  -Yes.

1230
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:55,682
-别让他跑掉  -瑞恩...
-Don't let him get past you.  -Ryan...

1231
02:01:55,849 --> 02:01:59,227
小心开枪
Be careful what you shoot at.

1232
02:01:59,394 --> 02:02:04,232
这里有很多东西不能中弹
Most things in here don't react too well to bullets.

1233
02:02:06,109 --> 02:02:08,737
对
Right.

1234
02:02:26,046 --> 02:02:28,966
你不知道小心开枪吗?
Be careful what I shoot at?

1235
02:02:37,224 --> 02:02:41,311
-鱼雷保险解除了  - 声纳  红十月号在哪里?
-Safety ranges set to zero.  -Sonar, give me the bearing for Red October.

1236
02:02:41,478 --> 02:02:47,192
-它在我们后面  -右满舵  我要打败他
-She's taking positioned behind us.  -Right full rudder. I'll shake the man loose.

1237
02:02:53,407 --> 02:02:57,077
-它在下潜  -俯倾30度
-He's going deep.  -30 degree down angle.

1238
02:02:57,244 --> 02:02:59,913
反鱼雷在那边? 很好
All the countermeasures were over there, right? Very well.

1239
02:03:25,355 --> 02:03:29,401
司令  雅夫级潜艇太快  他们逃不掉的
Admiral, the alfa's too quick. It's only a matter of time on search.

1240
02:03:29,568 --> 02:03:34,656
"瑞恩  这里有很多东西不能中弹..."
"Ryan, some things in here don't react well to bullets..."

1241
02:03:34,823 --> 02:03:38,619
对  我也不能中弹
Yeah, like me. I don't react well to bullets.

1242
02:03:58,221 --> 02:04:01,433
-钟斯  他在哪里?  -距离很近
-Where is he, Jonesy?  -Close, sir.

1243
02:04:03,352 --> 02:04:06,855
-正前方900米  -终于找到了
-900 meters, directly ahead.  -Got him.

1244
02:04:07,022 --> 02:04:10,192
-校准后发射  -距离太近
-Mark bearings and fire.  -We are too close.

1245
02:04:10,359 --> 02:04:15,739
别争论  发射鱼雷
Don't argue with me. Do it now!

1246
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:20,702
又发射了一颗鱼雷  它随时会爆炸
Another torpedo. It went active the moment it was launched.

1247
02:04:20,869 --> 02:04:25,666
-左满舵  平衡舰首  -鱼雷锁定我们了
-Left full rudder. Ease off on your bow planes.  -I think he's got us.

1248
02:04:35,592 --> 02:04:39,012
达拉斯号  干得漂亮!
Way to go, Dallas!

1249
02:04:42,766 --> 02:04:47,896
鱼雷在五百码外冲过来  你成功了
Torpedo is in acquisition. Range 500 yards and closing. You've done it, Thompson!

1250
02:04:48,063 --> 02:04:52,359
希望这行得通  大副  浮上水面
I hope this works. All right, chief, put us on the roof.

1251
02:04:52,526 --> 02:04:55,988
准备发射反鱼雷  听我命令  五  四...
Countermeasure station, on my mark. 5, 4...

1252
02:04:58,699 --> 02:05:03,829
发射反鱼雷  紧急上浮
Release counter measures. Emergency blow. Full rise.

1253
02:05:11,003 --> 02:05:14,590
500英尺
500 feet.

1254
02:05:14,756 --> 02:05:18,176
快点上浮
Come on, Big D. Fly!

1255
02:05:37,029 --> 02:05:40,699
鱼雷没停下来  它在寻找别的目标
That torpedo is still active. It's searching for another target, now.

1256
02:06:05,933 --> 02:06:11,146
竟然是他X的厨师
A goddamn cook.

1257
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:37,089
它锁定我们了!
Torpedo is locked on us!

1258
02:06:37,256 --> 02:06:40,050
-雅夫级潜艇离我们多近?  -左后方1000码处
-How close is that Alfa, Jonesy?  -1,000 yards dead astern, going to port.

1259
02:06:40,050 --> 02:06:42,844
-反方向转  -遵命
-Reverse your turn.  -Aye,sir.

1260
02:06:48,308 --> 02:06:52,562
我们冲向敌方  鱼雷跟着我们
We're turning straight at him. Torpedo's still on our tail.

1261
02:06:56,441 --> 02:07:01,238
在适当的时候退开
The hard part about playing chicken is knowing when to flinch.

1262
02:07:06,618 --> 02:07:10,664
距离400码  350码  300码...
Collision in 400 yards, 350, 300...

1263
02:07:10,831 --> 02:07:16,545
-舰长!  -右满舵  俯倾30度
-Captain!  -Right full rudder. 30 degree down angle.

1264
02:07:16,712 --> 02:07:20,173
这次必定很惊险
This one's going to be close.

1265
02:07:23,093 --> 02:07:26,847
你个傲慢的傻瓜  你会害死我们
You arrogant ass, you've killed us.

1266
02:07:55,208 --> 02:07:58,337
我们确定了红十月号的位置
We have ascertained the Red October's final position.

1267
02:07:58,964 --> 02:08:01,924
但爆炸碎片
But...given the depth of the water and the spread of...

1268
02:08:01,924 --> 02:08:04,885
遍布深海
the wreckage spreads across a wide area...

1269
02:08:05,052 --> 02:08:07,971
我们要花一段时间调查
it'll be some time before anything's recovered.

1270
02:08:08,138 --> 02:08:10,953
你们的人正在
However, your people are interviewing...

1271
02:08:10,953 --> 02:08:13,769
安排船员回国
the crew now and making arrangements for their return.

1272
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:18,273
这是一场悲惨的意外  大使先生
This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador.

1273
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:23,695
如果早点找我们  悲剧可能不会发生
And I can only stress hat if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avoided.

1274
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:30,702
-我欣赏你坦诚的性格  -彼此彼此
-I appreciate your candor in the matter.  -And I yours, Andrei.

1275
02:08:33,455 --> 02:08:36,291
可能在将来
Perhaps in the future...

1276
02:08:36,291 --> 02:08:39,127
会有更先进的科技来研究潜艇残骸
the technology will be available for an investigation of the wreckage.

1277
02:08:39,294 --> 02:08:43,173
也许吧
Perhaps.

1278
02:08:47,469 --> 02:08:53,850
-还有一件事  我难以启齿...  -请说
-There is another matter, one that I'm reluctant to...  -Please.

1279
02:08:55,352 --> 02:09:02,442
一艘雅夫级潜艇  曾经在大浅滩出没
One of our submarines, an Alfa, was last reported in the area of the Grand Banks.

1280
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:06,863
它跟我们失去联络
We've not heard from her for some time.

1281
02:09:08,156 --> 02:09:12,703
又一艘潜艇失踪?
Andrei. You've lost another submarine?

1282
02:09:20,103 --> 02:09:24,503
缅因州  佩诺布斯科特河

1283
02:09:27,092 --> 02:09:31,597
长途跋涉来  把潜艇藏在河里
All this way to hide a submarine in a river.

1284
02:09:32,806 --> 02:09:35,871
这儿距离海军基地一百英里
We're 100 miles from the nearest naval base...

1285
02:09:35,871 --> 02:09:38,937
而且卫星不会再窥探这地方
for the last place that satellites will ever look.

1286
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:44,318
我在这里长大
I grew up around here.

1287
02:09:44,484 --> 02:09:49,823
祖父在那个岛教我钓鱼
My grandfather taught me to fish off that island over there.

1288
02:09:52,868 --> 02:09:59,833
你心里还有一个疑问  为什么不问?
There is one question you haven't asked me yet. Why?

1289
02:10:01,627 --> 02:10:04,963
在适当的时候  你自然会说出来
Well, I figured you would tell me when you were ready.

1290
02:10:07,883 --> 02:10:12,512
有人说  我们要主动攻打美国
Now, there are those who believe we should attack the United States first.

1291
02:10:12,679 --> 02:10:19,186
了却一切恩怨  红十月号就是为此而建造的
Settle everything in one moment. Red October was built for that purpose.

1292
02:10:19,353 --> 02:10:24,900
-然后  莫斯科会付出沉重的代价  -也许吧
-When the dust settles from this, there's going to be hell to pay in Moscow.

1293
02:10:25,067 --> 02:10:28,278
那可能是好事
Maybe some good will come from it.

1294
02:10:28,445 --> 02:10:34,117
一场小革命能整顿国家  你觉得呢?
A little revolution now and then is a healthy thing, do you think?

1295
02:10:39,915 --> 02:10:43,710
-你仍然喜欢钓鱼吗  瑞恩?  -是的
-Do you still like to fish, Ryan?  -Mmm.

1296
02:10:45,128 --> 02:10:49,049
维尔纳斯有一条河  跟这里差不多
There's a river, not unlike this one, near Vilnius...

1297
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:53,887
我祖父在那里教我钓鱼
where my grandfather taught me to fish.

1298
02:10:54,930 --> 02:10:59,685
"大海为每个人带来新希望"
"And the sea will grant each man new hope."

1299
02:10:59,851 --> 02:11:03,563
"正如睡眠带来梦境"
"As sleep brings dreams."

1300
02:11:09,611 --> 02:11:12,322
克里斯托弗  哥伦布
Christopher Columbus.

1301
02:11:16,201 --> 02:11:19,580
欢迎光临新世界  舰长
Welcome to the new world, sir.
