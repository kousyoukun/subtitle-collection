1
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:40,240

2
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,580
It's cold this morning, Captain.

3
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,300
Cold.

4
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,180
And hard.

5
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,040
It's time, Captain.

6
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,540
It's time.

7
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:30,380
Time indeed.

8
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,580
Hey, what are you doing?

9
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,520
You're supposed to be upstairs sleeping.

10
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,780
- Stanley keeps waking me up.  - Oh, I get it...

11
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:02,070
- You're getting heavy.  - Don't let her pull more than her usual nonsense.

12
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,080
Two stories. Two glasses of water. Jack...

13
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,890
You're going to miss the plane.

14
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,540
OK. Cricket, you listen to me.

15
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,830
Go upstairs with Mrs. Wheeler now and go to sleep.

16
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,210
When I'm on my business trip...

17
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:17,420
I'll get Stanley a little brother, OK?

18
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,840
- Will you promise?  - I promise.

19
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,420
- Can I get you anything, sir?  - No, thank you very much.

20
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:01,030
You know, if you try and get some sleep...

21
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,470
the flight will go a lot faster.

22
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:07,180
I can never sleep on a plane. Turbulence.

23
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:10,560
- Pardon?  - Turbulence.

24
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,960
Solar radiation heats the earth's crust...

25
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,190
warm air rises, cool air descends.

26
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:19,360
- I don't like that.  - Oh, well, try to get some sleep anyway.

27
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:59,820
Dr Ryan?

28
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:19,590
Jack, boy, get yourself in here.

29
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:22,380
Jesus, you look like hell.

30
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:24,530
Thank you very much, Admiral.

31
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,510
- Want coffee?  - I think I need some coffee.

32
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,390
I'm not going to ask you how your flight went.

33
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,700
When did you last get some sleep?

34
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:36,850
Oh, I don't know. This thing's still on London time.

35
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,110
- Milk and sugar?  - Milk and sugar.

36
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:43,280
How's Caroline?

37
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,280
Last time I saw her was at your granddad's place in Maine.

38
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,870
She's fine. She sends you her best.

39
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,810
- And Sally?  - She's fine.

40
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:55,580
What is she now, three?

41
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,790
No, she's a very precocious five.

42
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,480
She announced to Caroline...

43
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,010
and I the other day that her life would be less lonely...

44
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:09,390
if we were to buy her a baby brother.

45
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,970
But she decided it would be enough...

46
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,390
if we were to buy one for Stanley.

47
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,230
- Who's Stanley?  - Ah, Stanley's a bear.

48
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:27,450
What's important enough to get you on a plane in the middle of the night?

49
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:29,950
British Intelligence obtained these pictures two days ago

50
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,280
She's the Red October.

51
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:36,330
- She's the latest Typhoon class.  - Big son of a bitch.

52
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,420
12 meters longer than standard Typhoon. 3 meters wider.

53
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,500
- Captain's name is Ramius.  - One of yours?

54
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,440
I did the bio on him last year.

55
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,220
He's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for 10 years.

56
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,930
Fairly good political connections.

57
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,470
Trained most of their attack-boat skippers.

58
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,690
The Russians call him Vilnius nastavnic.

59
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,440
The Vilnius schoolmaster.

60
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:08,440
- What are these doors?  - Those doors, sir, are the problem.

61
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:12,260
I don't know what they are, neither do the British.

62
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,910
Perhaps our friends in Murmansk have come up with something new.

63
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,950
With your permission...

64
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,830
I'd like to show these to someone.

65
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,580
Do you know Skip Tyler?

66
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,750
The sub driver?

67
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,750
He was. Clipped by a drunk driver. Lost his leg.

68
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,420
Now he's doing some teaches at the Academy consulting for Navy labs.

69
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:28,920
- Clearance?  - Top secret or better.

70
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,600
Margie, have a car for Dr. Ryan downstairs in 10 minutes.

71
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:43,400
The satellite caught Red October in Polijarny Inlet this morning.

72
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:29,860
- Do you hear it?  - No.

73
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,780
Beaumont, at Cal Tech we used to do this in our sleep.

74
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:35,530
You hear it now?

75
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,990
Wait a minute. maybe...

76
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,500
- It's buried in surface clutter.  - Yes.

77
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:47,000
- I should go to SAPS?  - Correct, Seaman Beaumont.

78
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:50,840
Signal Algorithmic Processing Systems.

79
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,590
Give it a week and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

80
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,850
So, like Beethoven on the computer...

81
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:11,780
you have labored to produce a biologic.

82
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,990
- A what?  - A whale. Beaumont. A whale...

83
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:22,200
A marine mammal that knows a lot more about sonar than you do.

84
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:27,540
Kill the SAPS. Train over to 269 and let's try it again.

85
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:33,550
If he gets to ragging on you too bad, ask him about Pavarotti.

86
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:36,650
We don't have time for sea stories.

87
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,600
I was in the middle of teaching Beaumont about modern sonar.

88
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,700
I ain't chief of the boat. I'm Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

89
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,640
Cob, please.  Come on, Cob. Tell me.

90
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,980
OK. Fine. Go ahead.

91
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:54,860
Ahem... Seaman Jones here, he's into music in a big way.

92
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:00,830
He figures this whole boat is basically just his own personal, private stereo set.

93
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,390
- He gets this piece of Pavarotti...  - It was Paganini.

94
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:05,790
- Whatever?  - Paganini.

95
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,120
This is my story, OK?

96
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,790
Pavarotti is a tenor. Paganini was a composer.

97
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,900
OK. So he's got this music, and he's got it out in the water.

98
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,840
He's listening on his headsets, happy as a clam.

99
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:22,410
Then all hell breaks loose.

100
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,810
There'a a whole slew of boats out of San Diego...

101
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,280
Including one way out at Pearl.

102
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,580
Including one way out at Pearl.

103
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:30,190
All of a sudden, they start hearing...

104
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,880
- Pavarotti.  - Pavarotti coming out of their asses.

105
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,400
Jones...

106
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,660
- What do I do?  - I got it.

107
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,060
Conn. Sonar.

108
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,000
New contact bearing 097. Designate contact Sierra-35.

109
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,190
Captain, aye. What've you got, Jones?

110
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:52,210
Distant contact, probably submerged.

111
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,870
It's a wild guess, but...

112
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,360
I'd say we hit a boomer, coming out of the barn.

113
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,340
Could be a missile boat out of Polijarny.

114
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,780
Ok. Start your track. I'll be there in a minute.

115
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,890
Sonar, aye.

116
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:08,390
Time to open the orders, sir.

117
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,710
The Political Officer is in your cabin.

118
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,500
Very well.

119
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,260
Carry on.

120
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,740
- What are you doing?  - Overseeing the stability of the crew.

121
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:49,990
By invading my privacy?

122
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:55,290
Privacy is not a major concern in the Soviet Union.

123
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,210
It is often contrary to the collective good.

124
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:12,310
"Behold, I am coming as a thief."

125
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,460
"And they gathered them together...

126
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,440
in a place called Armageddon. "

127
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:22,400
"The 7th angel poured forth his bowl...

128
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:25,530
and a voice cried out from Heaven..."

129
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:29,330
"It is done."

130
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,710
A man with your responsibilities reading about the end of the world.

131
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:41,210
And what's this? "I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."

132
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:45,550
It is an ancient Hindu text quoted by an American.

133
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,970
- An American?  - He invented the atomic bomb.

134
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:52,720
He was latter accused of being a communist.

135
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:56,520
You wrote and underlined these passages.

136
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,310
No.

137
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,070
This book belonged to my wife. I keep it for sentimental value.

138
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,450
I'm sorry, comrade Captain. Your wife was a beautiful woman.

139
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:11,370
Her death was unfortunate.

140
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:16,710
I am only doing my job. It is my responsibility.

141
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,130
How many agents did the KGB put aboard my boat?

142
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,190
- Your boat, Captain?  - Yes.

143
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,090
This vessel belongs to the people of the Soviet Union.

144
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:32,680
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU has agents aboard...

145
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:36,140
I would be the last to know.

146
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:41,980
I suggest we open our orders, Captain.

147
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,190
Certainly, comrade.

148
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:31,910
From Commander Strategic Submarine Forces Red Banner Northern Fleet.

149
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:37,200
We are to proceed north, to grid square 5490.

150
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,670
and rendezvous with Alfa submarine Konovalov.

151
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,960
Captain Tupolev's boat.

152
00:17:44,130 --> 00:17:47,230
You know Tupolev?

153
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,790
I know he descends from aristocracy...

154
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,340
and that he was your student.

155
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,260
It's rumored he has a place in his heart for you.

156
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:59,980
There's little room in Tupolev's heart for anyone but Tupolev.

157
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:04,940
Having made contact, we are to run a series of drills.

158
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:08,190
Tupolev will hunt us while we test our ship.

159
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:12,320
We are to evaluate the readiness of the caterpillar drive.

160
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:17,410
We return to Polijarny on or about the 16th of this month.

161
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,140
Captain, This is an historic moment for all of us.

162
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,710
I should like to make a request.

163
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:25,000
- Before you proceed...  - I know it's not protocol...

164
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,520
but would you permit me to...

165
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,880
post our orders and inform the crew of our mission?

166
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,290
Where I am going, you can not follow.

167
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,570
Dr Petrov, report to my cabin immediately.

168
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,400
There's been a dreadful accident.

169
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
Hey, buddy!

170
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,450
Listen to me. There's no cradle underneath it. Get it over¡£

171
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:27,000
Relax! Stop being an old maid. You want to come up here and do it yourself?

172
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,210
Ryan! Who let you in here?

173
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,840
Have they got you playing with models now?

174
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:44,720
Damn it, Phil! Tell them to slow down.

175
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:50,310
It's not a model. It's a DSRV. Rescue sub.

176
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:51,940
I know what it is. And I just need to see one before.

177
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:53,400
What are you doing with it?

178
00:20:53,570 --> 00:20:56,610
Ah, well, we're rigging it with a generic docking collar...

179
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:59,660
so it'll mate with British, German... just about anybody's sub.

180
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,120
We can get it anywhere in the world in 24 hours.

181
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:10,750
- How's your back?  - It's fine. Have you got a minute?

182
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:16,880
It's bigger than a regular Typhoon. What are these doors?

183
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,800
You don't miss much, do you?

184
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:24,060
Those are too big to be torpedo tubes.

185
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,290
Can you launch an ICBM horizontally?

186
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,350
Sure. Why would you want to?

187
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:34,070
They're symmetrical, right down the long axis of the sub.

188
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,900
How about a towed sonar array?

189
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,570
Nope. Too close to the screws.

190
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,870
I'll be...

191
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,950
This could be a caterpillar.

192
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,680
A what?

193
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,250
Uh, a caterpillar drive. Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

194
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,710
- Do you follow?  - No.

195
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:58,340
It's like a jet engine for the water.

196
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,990
Goes in the front, gets squirted out the back.

197
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:03,470
Only it's got no moving parts, so it's very, very quiet.

198
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:06,200
Like how quiet?

199
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,770
It's doubtful our sonar would even pick it up.

200
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:10,500
And if it did, it would sound like whales humping...

201
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,060
or a seismic anomaly.

202
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:15,190
Anything but a submarine.

203
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,820
We messed with this a couple of years ago.

204
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,280
Couldn't make it work.

205
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:24,300
They really built this?

206
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,140
This isn't a mock-up or anything.

207
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:27,990
She put to sea this morning.

208
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:38,420
When I was twelve, I helped my daddy build a bomb shelter in our basement...

209
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,680
because some fool parked a dozen warheads 90 miles off the coast of Florida.

210
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:49,140
This thing could park 200 warheads off Washington or New York...

211
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:55,480
and no one would know anything about it until it was all over.

212
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,490
- Are you all right, Captain?  - Oh, yes.

213
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:13,210
It's just to die for something as petty as slipping on tea.

214
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:15,580
You're blaming yourself, Captain. It was an accident.

215
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,790
You'll feel better when we put in.

216
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,420
- Put in?  - Well, to base, Captain.

217
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:23,370
We cannot go on without a political officer.

218
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,550
Doctor, this is a combat vessel of the Soviet Navy.

219
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:29,870
And I'm a senior combat officer.

220
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:34,600
We do not cancel operations because of accidents.

221
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:40,360
Seaman, come here. Come here.

222
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,820
- Your name?  - Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.

223
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:49,830
Good. I want you and the doctor to witness this.

224
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:53,270
I'm removing the Political Officer's missile key carry on...

225
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,540
and I'm keeping it by myself.

226
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,380
Captain, I think we should report this to Red Fleet Command.

227
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,360
I'm afraid that's impossible, Doctor.

228
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,180
Our orders are for strict radio silence.

229
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:11,560
- That's all, Loginov.  - This is most unnerving, Captain.

230
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,580
The reason for having two missile keys...

231
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,440
is so that no one man may...

232
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:24,780
- May what?  - May arm the missiles.

233
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,150
Perhaps I should keep the key.

234
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:29,370
Thank you. That'll be all, Doctor.

235
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:35,200
When I address the crew, then you will understand.

236
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:45,550
Petrov, I will try to forget your comments when I present my report.

237
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,880
Thank you, sir.

238
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:59,650
Holding steady on 310. 12 knots at about 20,000 yards.

239
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,860
- Have you got a make on it?  - The computer is chewing on it, sir.

240
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,320
Twin screws. The plant noise sounds like a typhoon.

241
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,200
I'd say we got a new boat, sir.

242
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:21,330
Tommy, I miss something on the boards last few days?

243
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,250
Sub plant hasn't said anything about it.

244
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:31,470
- All right. How many Typhoons are listed?  - Six, sir.

245
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,680
OK. Call this guy Typhoon Seven.

246
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,720
Start a tape on him. See if we can work in a little closer.

247
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,770
Yes, sir.

248
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,610
Won't he hear us?

249
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,860
Not if we stay in his baffles, Seaman Beaumont.

250
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,990
Come in behind his propeller and he's deaf as a post.

251
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:21,660
Any sonar contacts, Mr.Kamarov?

252
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:24,900
No contacts, Captain. The sonar is clear.

253
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,230
Good. Do we have any surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?

254
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,400
No contacts, sir. Scope is clear.

255
00:26:29,570 --> 00:26:34,030
Good. Then it's time I explain our orders to the crew.

256
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:38,490
Comrades, this is your captain.

257
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:41,790
It is an honor to speak to you today...

258
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,480
and I'm honored to be sailing with you on the maiden voyage...

259
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,000
of our motherland's most recent achievement.

260
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:52,090
And once more, we play our dangerous game.

261
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:58,060
A game of chess, against our old adversary the American Navy.

262
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,830
For 40 years, your fathers before you...

263
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:05,440
and your older brothers played this game and played it well.

264
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,990
But today the game is different. We have the advantage.

265
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:15,320
It reminds me of the heady days of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin.

266
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,910
when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets.

267
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:22,580
It will tremble again at the sound of our silence.

268
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:26,830
- The order is: Engage the silent drive.  - Aye, sir.

269
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,840
- Ballast control, open outer doors.  - Yes, open outer doors.

270
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,300
Diving command. Engage caterpillar and secure main engines.

271
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,020
Doors opening, Captain.

272
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:45,190
Comrades, our own fleet doesn't know our full potential.

273
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:48,150
They will do everything possible to test us,

274
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:50,880
but they will only test their own embarrassment.

275
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,440
We will leave our fleet behind.

276
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:58,120
We will pass through the American patrols pass their sonar nets...

277
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:03,410
and lay off their largest city and listen to their rock 'n' roll...

278
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,670
while we conduct missile drills.

279
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:13,920
When we are finished the only sound they will hear is our laughter.

280
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:20,560
while we sail to Havana where the sun is warm and so is the comradeship.

281
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:24,030
Cryogenic plant coming on line, Captain.

282
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:28,400
A great day, comrades. We sail into history.

283
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:38,610
Caterpillar engaging.

284
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:42,160
Caterpillar engaging, Captain.

285
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,300
- What happened?  - I don't know.

286
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,710
Full rudder left.

287
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:32,920
Navigator, new course: 250.

288
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,300
Yes. New course: 250.

289
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:13,130
Sonar contact, Captain. Port quarter. Close aboard.

290
00:30:13,290 --> 00:30:17,510
- American, Los Angeles class.  - American! Captain, we...

291
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,970
Course: 310.

292
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:24,850
Is the American turning to follow us?

293
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,560
No, Captain. The American is continuing in his original course.

294
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,980
- He is continuing north-west.  - He can't hear us.

295
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,480
And the singing?

296
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,290
Let them sing.

297
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,040
What are you talking about? Check your gear.

298
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,020
Running diagnostics now, Captain.

299
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,990
The sonar is working, Captain. The Russian disappeared.

300
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,580
One minute he was steady, 4,000 yards off the bow then he was gone.

301
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,750
- And for a second, I thought I heard...  - Heard what?

302
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:39,250
I thought I heard singing, sir.

303
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,130
- Singing?  - Yes, sir.

304
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,690
Good morning, sir.

305
00:31:58,690 --> 00:32:01,730
Good morning, sir.

306
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:06,410
Good morning, sir.

307
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:14,500
Good morning, sir. I hope you had a lovely evening.

308
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:18,040
A little chilly this morning.

309
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,570
There's a letter from Marko Ramius.

310
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:48,110
Ah, Marko!

311
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,440
Yes?

312
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:25,280
No, this is Dr Ryan.

313
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,490
- What the hell happened?  - This is no longer research project.

314
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,270
I got a line on those doors.

315
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:42,040
You know what they are?

316
00:33:45,090 --> 00:33:50,260
- A nearly silent propulsion system.  - How did you know that?

317
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,910
The captain of the sub following her radioed in.

318
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,510
Thing disappeared right in front of him.

319
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:58,430
And that's only the half of it. Read.

320
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:11,780
- Got your ID?  - My god, this is unbelievable.

321
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:16,540
The Kirov, three Sverdlovs, the Kiev, the Minsk.

322
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,220
They've sortied their whole bloody fleet.

323
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:19,750
That's about the size of it.

324
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:27,210
- Where are we going anyway?  - Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt.

325
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:30,630
The President's Security Advisor.

326
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,890
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there, along with a few other people.

327
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:38,310
- Who is giving the briefing?  - You are.

328
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,100
The yeoman will have all the slides laid out for you.

329
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,730
So all you've got to do...

330
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:53,280
Look, no one understands this material better than you.

331
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:58,370
Just give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand.

332
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:02,960
He's liable to ask some direct questions. Give him direct answers.

333
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,040
Tell him what you think. Come on.

334
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,160
Uh, gentlmen. The last 24 hours...

335
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,640
have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity.

336
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:23,690
The first to sail was this ship we believe called the Red October...

337
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:27,440
in reference to the October revolution of 1917.

338
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:31,240
A variant of the Typhoon class, she's 650 feet long

339
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:34,030
and 32,000 tons submerged displacement.

340
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:36,660
Roughly the same size as a World War II aircraft carrier.

341
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:41,080
We believe that these doors here on the bow...

342
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:45,080
...and again on the stern enclose a unique propulsion system.

343
00:35:45,250 --> 00:35:48,750
A magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar...

344
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,800
that would enable the sub to run virtually silent.

345
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,780
It is possible that this new drive system allowed the captain...

346
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:58,600
a man named Ramius, their senior and perhaps most respected commander.

347
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,770
Do we have his picture available?

348
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,790
Allowed Ramius to elude one of our attack boats...

349
00:36:04,790 --> 00:36:07,650
the Dallas, which trailed Red October from harbor this morning.

350
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,320
It is also possible that this drive system, if operable could render...

351
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:19,530
the Red October undetectable to our Sosus warning nets in the Atlantic.

352
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:24,910
Mr.Ryan. Would you characterize this as a first-strike weapon?

353
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:30,290
Uh, that is a possibility, sir.

354
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:34,910
It is designed to approach by stealth and to shower its target with multiple...

355
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:37,130
independent warheads with little or no warning before impact.

356
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,970
Goddamn thing was made to start a war.

357
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:43,640
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

358
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,710
About the same time the Dallas lost contact...

359
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,600
there were additional sailings.

360
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:53,480
From Polijarny and from Leningrad on the Baltic and from the Mediterranean.

361
00:36:53,650 --> 00:36:58,780
There are now some 58 nuclear submarines headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

362
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,470
This afternoon's satellite pass over...

363
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:04,000
Polijarny found heat blooms in the engineering plants...

364
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,770
at the Kirov, the Minsk and...

365
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:09,380
more than 20 other cruisers and destroyers, indicating they were preparing to sail.

366
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,040
This constitutes the bulk of the Soviet surface fleet.

367
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,550
Admiral Greer, your conclusions.

368
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:19,050
Well, sir, the data support no conclusions as yet.

369
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,190
The absence of activity in the Pacific...

370
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:23,160
suggests this could be just an exercise.

371
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,100
Suppose it's not an exercise?

372
00:37:27,270 --> 00:37:31,310
Suppose this is the beginning of a move against NATO?

373
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:36,210
NSA can speak for that, Mr. Pelt. I must emphasize the extreme sensitivity...

374
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,570
of this information and that it not leave the room.

375
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,970
Before sailing...

376
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,200
Captain Ramius sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin.

377
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,950
Chairman of the Red Fleet northern political directorate.

378
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,330
That's her uncle.

379
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,540
- Whose uncle?  - Ramius' wife.

380
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:54,880
Padorin is her uncle.

381
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:57,400
Now, the contents of the letter are unknown

382
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,090
but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded a meeting with Premier Chernenko...

383
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:08,390
and within minutes of that meeting the Soviet fleet sailed with orders to...

384
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:11,190
find Red October and sink her.

385
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:16,610
- Sink her?  - My God. They've got a madman on their hands.

386
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,910
Within 500 miles off the coast, we'll have only two minutes' warning.

387
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,710
- Today's the 23rd, isn't it?  - What?

388
00:38:38,710 --> 00:38:41,130
- Is today the 23rd?  - Yeah.

389
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:55,480
You son of a bitch.

390
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:59,240
You son of a bitch!

391
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,280
You wish to add something to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

392
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:16,670
I was just thinking that perhaps there's another possibility we might consider.

393
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,460
Ramius might be trying to defect.

394
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:24,090
- Do you mean to suggest that this man has come...  - Proceed. Mr. Ryan.

395
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:32,270
Look. Ramius trained most of their officer corps...

396
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,900
which would put him in a position to select men willing to help him.

397
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:40,480
He's not Russian. He's Lithuanian by birth...

398
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:44,490
raised by his paternal grandfather, a fisherman.

399
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,200
And he has no children. No ties to leave behind.

400
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:55,370
And today is the first anniversary of his wife's death.

401
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,610
Oh. Come on. You're just an analyst. How can you read his mind?

402
00:39:58,610 --> 00:40:01,670
I know Ramius, General.

403
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,170
He's nearly a legend in the submarine community.

404
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,510
He's been a maverick his entire career.

405
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:09,010
I actually met him once at an embassy dinner.

406
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:11,350
Have you ever met Captain Ramius, General?

407
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,450
Admiral Hollis

408
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,450
how long before Ramius could be in a position to fire his missiles at us?

409
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,500
- Four days.  - All right, I'll brief the President.

410
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:38,420
Dr Ryan, would you stay for a moment, please?

411
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:42,800
I said speak your mind, Jack, but Jesus...

412
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,850
You slammed the door on the general pretty hard, Jack.

413
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:01,570
- That was not my intention, sir.  - Oh, yes, it was.

414
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,550
He was patronizing you, and you stomped on him.

415
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:07,360
In my opinion, he deserved it.

416
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:12,620
Listen, I'm a politician, which means I'm a cheat and a liar...

417
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,330
and when I'm not kissing babies, I'm stealing their lollipops.

418
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:21,500
But it also means that I keep my options open.

419
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:27,260
So let's assume for a minute that you're right...

420
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:34,020
and this Russian intends to defect. What do you suggest we do about it?

421
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,020
- We definitely grab the boat, sir.  - Hey, wait a minute.

422
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:43,440
We're not talking about some stray pilot with a M.I.G.

423
00:41:43,610 --> 00:41:48,570
We're talking about several billion dollars worth of Soviet state property.

424
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,220
They're going to want it back.

425
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:53,700
Maybe it's enough then just to get some people on board and inspect it.

426
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:57,960
Call it whatever you want to... a Coastguard safety inspection.

427
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:01,500
So how do we proceed?

428
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:05,460
First, we need to contact the commanders in the Atlantic directly.

429
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,920
The Russians get one whiff of this through...

430
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,220
the regular communications circuits, the game is up.

431
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,430
Secondly, we figure out how we can help them.

432
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:18,230
We need to devise a plan to intercede, ready to go at a moment's notice.

433
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:21,080
The third, somebody's got to go make contact with Ramius...

434
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,770
and find out what his intentions really are.

435
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,030
Okay, when do you leave?

436
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:32,110
Wait a minute!

437
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:36,370
The general was right. I am not field personnel. I am only an analyst.

438
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,660
You're perfect. I can't ask any of these characters to go.

439
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,420
One, they don't believe them. Two, they wouldn't stake their reputations on a hunch...

440
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:46,960
- where as you...  - Are expendable.

441
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:52,010
Something like that.

442
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:57,720
I'll give you three days to prove your theory correct.

443
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:04,480
After that, I have to hunt down Ramius and destroy him. Will you do it?

444
00:43:21,290 --> 00:43:23,420
Mother of God!

445
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,840
Secure the masts. All ahead two thirds. Set depth to 900 meters.

446
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:32,090
- What is it? What's happened?  - Mast secured, helm at 2/3.

447
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:37,390
Come left, heading 205.

448
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,910
These orders are seven bloody hours old! Sitting on the bottom.

449
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,280
Like an addled schoolboy.

450
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:02,080
- Captain?  - All ahead flank.

451
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:07,420
Inquire of the engineer about going to 105% on the reactor.

452
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:13,510
Seven hours! The entire fleet is after him.

453
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,980
Leveling at 900 meters.

454
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:30,780
Captain, Engineer reports 105% on the reactor is possible... but not recommended.

455
00:44:41,370 --> 00:44:44,500
Go to 105 on the reactor.

456
00:44:46,830 --> 00:44:52,920
- Captain, what is it? Where are we going?  - We're going to kill a friend.

457
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:57,390
We're going to kill Ramius.

458
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:22,030
If you like borscht, perhaps, but I've eaten better in an oiler's galley.

459
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,500
My wife asked the waiter, "Where did this man learn to cook, Afghanistan?"

460
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,090
So then we went on to the Bolshoi, the ballet, to see this new girl as Giselle.

461
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:36,760
You remember how beautiful she was. She just married a factory manager.

462
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:43,510
Excuse me, Doctor. Do you have the figures for the latest batch of radiation tests?

463
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,060
Now?

464
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,400
Now.

465
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:55,360
Perhaps you could bring the preceding set as well... for comparison.

466
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:58,400
Thank you, Doctor.

467
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:18,380
It will take him some time.

468
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:24,470
Before we begin, Captain. I'd like to know exactly what happened to Putin.

469
00:46:30,350 --> 00:46:36,650
- He didn't slip on his tea, did he?  - I don't think I like your tone, Slavin.

470
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,220
What the hell's my tone got to do with it?

471
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:41,630
We're risking our lives here.

472
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:44,030
Putin could have made complications.

473
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:48,250
Did you think he would go away and sulk while we carried out our plans?

474
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:51,710
Are you saying he was murdered?

475
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,000
- My God.  - Stop whining, Yuri.

476
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:59,050
So he was murdered. I have no problem with that. The man was a pig.

477
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,390
- But it is a decision we should have all made together.  - You are not in command here.

478
00:47:03,550 --> 00:47:08,600
If the crew finds out, we could have a mutiny.

479
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:11,770
Everything that happens on this ship affects us all.

480
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,770
The Master-At-Arms is already suspicious.

481
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,570
- We could still go back.  - There'll be no going back.

482
00:47:20,740 --> 00:47:26,580
Before we sailed, I dispatched a letter to Admiral Padorin...

483
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,120
in which I announced our intention to defect.

484
00:47:32,870 --> 00:47:36,290
In the name of God, why?

485
00:47:36,460 --> 00:47:41,130
When he reached the new world, Cortez burned his ships.

486
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:46,800
- As a result, his men were well motivated.  - You have signed our death warrants.

487
00:47:46,970 --> 00:47:52,640
- Padorin will send the entire fleet.  - Jesus! They'll find us.

488
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:57,480
Nobody is going to find us. That's enough, Yuri.

489
00:47:57,650 --> 00:48:03,150
You had to do it, huh? You couldn't just turn the submarine over to the Americans.

490
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:07,070
You had to make a political statement.

491
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:13,960
Or was it something deeper, Captain? Something that made you unable to slip away?

492
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:20,630
- Was it ego, Captain?  - We each have our reasons, Victor.

493
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:25,430
My own began the day I was handed the blueprints for this ship.

494
00:48:25,590 --> 00:48:30,220
A ship which had but one use. And as for the rest...

495
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:34,940
well, those are things that I alone must carry the burden for.

496
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:41,730
Anatoly, you're afraid of our fleet. Well, you should be.

497
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:47,070
Personally, I give us... one chance in three.

498
00:48:50,410 --> 00:48:54,410
More tea, anyone?

499
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,500
No?

500
00:48:58,670 --> 00:49:02,000
Then you may report back to your posts.

501
00:49:18,230 --> 00:49:21,820
You heard the captain, dismissed.

502
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,740
Captain.

503
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:49,470
Captain, I would never disagree with you in front of the men, you know that.

504
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,350
But in this case Victor was right.

505
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:58,480
- It would have been better if you had not informed to Moscow.  - Oh, Vasily.

506
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:04,230
Moscow is not the worry, nor the whole Soviet Navy.

507
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:10,030
I know their tactics. I have the advantage.

508
00:50:12,740 --> 00:50:16,620
The worry is the Americans.

509
00:50:16,790 --> 00:50:22,080
If we meet the right sort, this will work.

510
00:50:24,170 --> 00:50:28,800
We get some buckaroo...

511
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,560
Some turbulence. You don't like flying?

512
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,940
This is nothing. You should have been here five months ago.

513
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,820
Talk about puke! We ran into a hail storm over the Sea of Japan, Right?

514
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:51,530
The pilot shot his lunch all over the windshield...

515
00:50:51,700 --> 00:50:54,370
and I barfed on the radio.

516
00:50:54,530 --> 00:50:57,520
Knocked it out completely, and it wasn't that...

517
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,500
lightweight stuff either! It was that chunky, industrial-weight puke!

518
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:04,090
You want a bite?

519
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,590
Next time you get a bright idea, just put it in a memo.

520
00:51:16,930 --> 00:51:21,600
- Sir.  - That will be all, Lieutenant. Thank you.

521
00:51:21,770 --> 00:51:26,730
- That hawkeye from Weymouth Trap?  - Four wire. Caught a gust over the fantail.

522
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,110
- Not bad considering.  - The gentleman is here to see you.

523
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,370
The gentleman? What the hell are you talking about, Charlie?

524
00:51:34,530 --> 00:51:39,410
I apologize for the uniform, sir. This is Admiral Greer's idea of a low profile.

525
00:51:39,580 --> 00:51:42,810
- You work for Jim Greer?  - That's all right, sir.

526
00:51:42,810 --> 00:51:46,040
Then I imagine you'll tell me what all the hubbub's about.

527
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:53,840
Captain, you got a minute? Jonesy's got something I think you ought to see.

528
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:00,390
- Martinez, get yourself a cup of coffee. Send me up some tea.  - Aye, Captain.

529
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,850
Messenger, get the captain a cup of tea.

530
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:13,200
Captain. Sir, the moment that sub went silent and I thought I heard singing...

531
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:16,740
I heard something in the background, real faint.

532
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:20,120
After all those subs took off, I caught it again and got it on tape.

533
00:52:20,290 --> 00:52:25,250
I washed it through the computer and was able to isolate this sound.

534
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:33,420
The computer identified it as magma displacement.

535
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:38,640
The SAPS software was originally written to look for seismic events.

536
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:42,640
When it gets confused, it runs home to momma.

537
00:52:42,810 --> 00:52:45,810
- I'm not following you.  - Sir, I'm sorry.

538
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,980
Listen to it at ten times speed.

539
00:52:56,570 --> 00:53:00,700
- Now, that's got to be manmade, Captain.  - All right.

540
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,420
The first contact was at 09:15 and the bearing was 269.

541
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:10,250
At 09:30, it was here.

542
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,920
I came back to it at 11:00 and 11:15, here and here.

543
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:15,950
Remember the dispatch we got about Russian sub skippers running...

544
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,800
the Reykjanes Ridge at high speeds...

545
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:20,700
because they had hyper-accurate surveys of the underwater canyons...

546
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:22,430
Yeah, Red Route One.

547
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:27,440
The front door to those canyons was a formation called Thor's Twins, Right?

548
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:29,940
Look at that.

549
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:47,580
- Right into Red Route One.  - Captain.

550
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:51,460
You may think I'm crazy, but I'll bet that...

551
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:55,170
magma displacement was actually some new Russian sub...

552
00:53:55,340 --> 00:53:59,430
and it's headed for the Iceland coast.

553
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:02,870
Have I got this straight, Jonesy?

554
00:54:02,870 --> 00:54:06,140
A $40 million computer tells you you're chasing an earthquake...

555
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:11,650
but you don't believe it. And you come up with this on your own.

556
00:54:11,810 --> 00:54:17,820
- Yes, sir.  - Relax, you've sold me.

557
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:25,700
Tommy, I want you to plot us a speed course for the bottom end of Red Route One.

558
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,620
We'll never find him in those canyons.

559
00:54:28,620 --> 00:54:31,380
First take us to periscope depth. But first we'd better phone in.

560
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,670
Aye, aye, Captain.

561
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,600
Hang on, Jonesy.

562
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:53,060
If I can get you close enough, can you track this sucker?

563
00:54:53,230 --> 00:54:59,450
Yes, sir. Now that I know what to listen for... I'll bag him.

564
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:04,410
- Carry on.  - Yes, sir.

565
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,890
That's the craziest notion I've ever heard...

566
00:55:07,890 --> 00:55:11,210
a serving line officer? An entire ballistic missile submarine?

567
00:55:11,370 --> 00:55:15,710
They can't all want to defect, even if it's only the officers.

568
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,420
- What's his plan?  - His plan?

569
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:23,050
Russians don't take a dump without a plan.

570
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:25,550
Senior captains don't start...

571
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:27,890
something this dangerous without having thought the matter through.

572
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,400
What's he going to do, he's just going to sail into New York?

573
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,400
It might be that simple.

574
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,440
Things may appear simple in the cubicle at CIA.

575
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:40,820
But in the middle of the North Atlantic they get a bit more complex.

576
00:55:40,990 --> 00:55:44,620
- Smoke?  - No, thank you.

577
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:49,120
And I don't think your notion of a few days inspection's going to wash either.

578
00:55:49,290 --> 00:55:51,500
In order to be any value, you'd have to tear it apart.

579
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,710
The metallurgy would take a couple of months.

580
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,170
- Then we have to keep it.  - What will you do with the crew?

581
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:03,090
Ones that don't defect will go back and say we got the boat.

582
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:09,310
- Or do you plan to eliminate them?  - We're not at war, sir.

583
00:56:09,470 --> 00:56:13,190
So you have to get them off the boat in such a way...

584
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:15,190
that they think we don't have it.

585
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:19,190
They'll go back and report that we don't have it to their bosses.

586
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,530
Otherwise, this whole business is just academic, right?

587
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,950
Yes, sir. I think I see your point.

588
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:34,500
- When was the last time you slept?  - A while.

589
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,050
- The chief outside will fix you up.  - Thank you, sir.

590
00:56:40,210 --> 00:56:42,630
Captain.

591
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:50,140
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours. We'll be in the CIC.

592
00:56:50,310 --> 00:56:55,480
- Things are liable to get a little dicey around here.  - Yes, sir.

593
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:07,910
- You think he's crazy?  - Certifiable.

594
00:57:08,070 --> 00:57:12,290
And I don't care for him wearing the uniform.

595
00:57:12,450 --> 00:57:15,350
Did you see that ring on his finger? The Academy class of '72. A Marine.

596
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:18,250
You're kidding. How did you...

597
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:25,300
Greer told me. Summer of his third year, he went down in a chopper accident.

598
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:28,890
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

599
00:57:28,890 --> 00:57:32,310
That kid spent 10 months in traction and another year learning to walk again.

600
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:37,520
He did his fourth year from the hospital.

601
00:57:37,690 --> 00:57:43,150
It's up to you, Charlie, but you might consider cutting him a little slack.

602
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:49,820
The Russians will find that sub before we get near it anyway.

603
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:15,100
- Passing Thor's Twins, sir.  - Very good.

604
00:58:19,480 --> 00:58:23,770
- Passing the Twins now, Captain.  - Very good. Commence your run.

605
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,150
- Call me when you get to the first turn.  - Aye, Captain.

606
00:58:27,320 --> 00:58:31,370
Mr. Kamarov, you may commence your run now.  - Aye, sir.

607
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:37,870
First leg on my mark. Course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

608
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,790
Depth: 270 meters.

609
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:46,170
Five, four, three, two, one...

610
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:48,630
Mark.

611
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:54,600
Diving Command, course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

612
00:58:54,760 --> 00:59:01,520
Give me a stopwatch and a map and I'll fly the Alps in a plane with no windows.

613
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:05,110
If the map is accurate enough.

614
00:59:25,290 --> 00:59:29,380
We're in the lane and approaching the first turn.

615
00:59:29,550 --> 00:59:34,470
Come left to course 195 in 30 seconds.

616
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,560
Decrease depth to 200 meters. Maintain speed.

617
00:59:41,770 --> 00:59:45,860
Captain, we are approaching the first turn. 25 seconds to course 1-9-5.

618
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,820
Increase speed to 26 knots and recompute.

619
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,910
Aye, Captain.

620
00:59:56,080 --> 01:00:00,000
Navigator, recompute for 26 knots.

621
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:05,460
Turn on my mark. Five, four, three...

622
01:00:05,630 --> 01:00:08,500
two, one, mark.

623
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:13,470
Diving control, come left to 195. Up on the bow planes.

624
01:00:21,390 --> 01:00:26,900
Course now 195 and maintaining speed 26 knots.

625
01:00:31,190 --> 01:00:35,280
- Mr. Kamarov?  - Next leg, Captain.

626
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:41,120
Come right to 240 at 8 minutes and 40 seconds.

627
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:45,080
Very good. Maintain course and speed.

628
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:51,590
Too fast, Vassily. Too fast.

629
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,180
Those charts are laid out precisely. So many knots for so many seconds.

630
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:02,480
- This thing handles like a pig.  - Watch your bearing, Mr. Slavin.

631
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,360
15 seconds to turn, Captain. Should we decrease speed?

632
01:01:12,530 --> 01:01:16,610
Negative. Prepare to come right.

633
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:21,490
Eight, seven, six, five, four...

634
01:01:21,660 --> 01:01:25,410
three, two, one, mark.

635
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:31,210
15 degrees down angle on the bow planes. Come right 240. Move it!

636
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:55,780
We're in the lane. Next leg 34 minutes to the Neptune Massif.

637
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,950
Course: 240.

638
01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:14,840
- What happened?  - The cryogenic plant.

639
01:02:15,010 --> 01:02:20,140
The magnets aren't being cooled. We're 50 degrees above red line.

640
01:02:20,300 --> 01:02:25,140
- It's going to melt.  - Kill it, shut it down!

641
01:02:28,810 --> 01:02:32,060
- Captain?  - What happened?

642
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:35,320
- The cryogenic plant failed.  - Reactor damage?

643
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:40,070
- The reactor scrammed automatically.  - Was there any core damage?

644
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:43,620
- Any radiation leakage?  - I don't know yet.

645
01:02:43,780 --> 01:02:50,040
- How long will it take to fix?  - I've got to find out what's wrong first.

646
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:55,550
Captain, we will have to stop until we can repair the caterpillar unit.

647
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:02,050
- Negative. We will run on normal propulsion.  - Captain, we will not be silent.

648
01:03:02,220 --> 01:03:08,020
Make revolutions for 20 knots and engage the propellers.

649
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:16,820
- Aye, Captain.  - That man will get us all killed.

650
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,580
The captain knows what he's doing.

651
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:32,500
Naval activities? I have no knowledge of this.

652
01:03:32,670 --> 01:03:36,800
- But then, I never was a sailor.  - Mr. Ambassador...

653
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:41,840
You have nearly 100 naval vessels operating in the North Atlantic right now.

654
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:45,180
Your aircraft have dropped enough sonar buoys

655
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:48,020
that a man could walk from Greenland to Scotland without getting his feet wet.

656
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,690
Shall we dispense with the bull?

657
01:03:50,850 --> 01:03:55,980
You make your point as delicately as ever, Mr. Pelt. But...

658
01:03:56,150 --> 01:04:01,030
And what looks like an exercise could be a prelude to war.

659
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,720
How can we tell the difference?

660
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:06,240
Prudence demands that we deploy ships to observe yours.

661
01:04:06,410 --> 01:04:09,410
Your government should consider that...

662
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:15,380
that having your ships and ours in such proximity...

663
01:04:15,540 --> 01:04:21,630
is inherently dangerous? Wars have begun that way, Mr. Ambassador.

664
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:33,480
We have lost one of our submarines.

665
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,810
- Lost it?  - We fear she may be down, and...

666
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:39,070
this is most embarrassing, but...

667
01:04:39,230 --> 01:04:45,780
Several of the crew, the officers, are sons of high Party officials.

668
01:04:45,950 --> 01:04:51,700
One is even the son of a Central Committee member. I can't say which.

669
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:58,040
- You're telling me this is a massive rescue operation?  - That is correct.

670
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:04,720
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

671
01:05:07,050 --> 01:05:11,640
- I'm not sure that...  - Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

672
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,020
That is very gracious of you, sir.

673
01:05:18,190 --> 01:05:21,150
I will pass your offer on.

674
01:05:21,320 --> 01:05:24,530
But at this time, I think we're doing everything that can be done.

675
01:05:44,340 --> 01:05:46,630
Captain.

676
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:54,730
Our strategy depends on your answer. The entire fleet will know where we are.

677
01:05:54,890 --> 01:05:59,810
Captain, Sonar. We have just been overflown by a multi-engine turboprop.

678
01:05:59,980 --> 01:06:02,690
Put it on audio.

679
01:06:05,190 --> 01:06:10,490
Short transients, close aboard. Water entry of small objects.

680
01:06:10,660 --> 01:06:14,750
- Sonar buoys.  - Battle stations.

681
01:06:14,910 --> 01:06:18,000
Battle stations!

682
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,790
How long to Neptune Massif?

683
01:06:21,960 --> 01:06:26,590
- How long?  - 4 minutes, 10 seconds.

684
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:30,800
- Should we bottom the boat, Captain?  - No. Too late for that now.

685
01:06:30,970 --> 01:06:36,730
We're out of time. Counter measures. Prepare to launch a full spread.

686
01:06:45,230 --> 01:06:48,360
Aircraft on computer guidance. Request permission to launch the weapon.

687
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:51,450
You are authorized to launch the weapon.

688
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:55,910
Weapon is away.

689
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:04,130
- High-speed screw. Torpedo in the water. - Stand by.

690
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:09,430
Torpedo is active.

691
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:13,510
- Torpedo has acquired.  - Launch counter measures.

692
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:16,350
Launch countermeasures. Aye, sir.

693
01:07:21,600 --> 01:07:24,130
We're in the lane.

694
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:26,650
- How long to the turn at Massif?  - 2 minutes, 9 seconds.

695
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:30,150
We have no room to maneuver in these canyons, Captain.

696
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,780
Shut up!

697
01:07:36,700 --> 01:07:39,680
Torpedo has reached counter measures. Torpedo has lost contact.

698
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,670
Massif approaching.

699
01:07:45,340 --> 01:07:51,260
Torpedo has reacquired and is homing.

700
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:56,890
- Give me the count.  - Turn at Massif 40 degrees starboard in 30 seconds.

701
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:00,810
- Time to torpedo impact?  - Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.

702
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:04,730
- Increase to flank.  - Full ahead flank.

703
01:08:06,190 --> 01:08:11,700
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds. 35 seconds.

704
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:21,960
30 seconds.

705
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:26,290
Turn at Massif in seven, six...

706
01:08:26,460 --> 01:08:29,710
five, four...

707
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:33,970
three, two, one, mark.

708
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:36,160
Torpedo impact: 25 seconds.

709
01:08:36,160 --> 01:08:38,180
- The turn, Captain.  - Not yet.

710
01:08:41,480 --> 01:08:45,770
Mark plus eight seconds, nine, ten...

711
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:52,900
11 seconds, 12, 13, 14... plus 15 seconds.

712
01:08:53,070 --> 01:08:55,820
Captain, we're out of position so much by a boat length.

713
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:58,580
Torpedo impact now in 15 seconds.

714
01:08:58,740 --> 01:09:02,000
Sound collision.

715
01:09:02,160 --> 01:09:04,420
- Captain, we're out of the lane.  - You're relieved.

716
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,670
Borodin?

717
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:17,890
Right full rudder! Reverse starboard engine!

718
01:09:21,850 --> 01:09:25,020
Torpedo impact: 12 seconds.

719
01:09:25,190 --> 01:09:31,610
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

720
01:09:34,650 --> 01:09:39,450
- Navigator.  - 16 degrees off the bow plane.

721
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:07,900
- Captain, they're really shooting at us! Why?  - Easy, boy.

722
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:13,030
If they were really shooting at us, we'd be dead by now.

723
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:36,770
I found out what happened to the caterpillar.

724
01:10:36,930 --> 01:10:40,140
The buffer circuit has been torn out.

725
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:43,360
It was only a matter of time, before an overload shut it down.

726
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,000
What are you saying?

727
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:50,490
Whoever did this knew how to cripple the caterpillar in a way not easy to find.

728
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:53,990
Captain, we have a saboteur on board.

729
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:02,000
It can't be any of the officers, They had plenty of time before we embarked.

730
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,920
Must be a member on the crew.

731
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:11,130
Go to Putin's cabin. Check his files for information on the crew.

732
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:13,640
We may have to put them off before we planned.

733
01:11:16,220 --> 01:11:20,890
"Your average Russkie don't take a dump without a plan."

734
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:25,400
And wait a minute.

735
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:30,690
We don't have to get the crew off the sub. He would have had to do that.

736
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:34,740
We just have to figure out what he's going to do.

737
01:11:34,740 --> 01:11:38,620
How is he going to get them off the sub?

738
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:43,080
They'd have to want to get off.

739
01:11:44,290 --> 01:11:49,130
How do you get a crew to want to get off a submarine?

740
01:11:49,300 --> 01:11:53,380
How do you get a crew to want to get off a nuclear sub...

741
01:11:53,550 --> 01:11:57,600
- I know how he'll get the crew off.  - Not now, Jack.

742
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,440
Yankee One, declaring an emergency.

743
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:10,440
Yankee One, vector 270. Speed is buster, over.

744
01:12:10,610 --> 01:12:13,070
Say again, Yankee One.

745
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,950
A Bear Foxtrot got too close to the group.

746
01:12:15,950 --> 01:12:18,660
One of the F-14s crowded him, and they bumped.

747
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:24,290
He's losing hydraulic fluid. They're trying to get him back aboard now.

748
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,250
- Busy morning.  - Mmm.

749
01:12:27,420 --> 01:12:32,970
During the night, Russian attack subs are now stationed off every East Coast port.

750
01:12:33,130 --> 01:12:35,630
We're up here.

751
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:39,050
The New Jersey is moving up the coast...

752
01:12:39,220 --> 01:12:42,140
while the Russians, aside from over 100 bear foxtrots, have a row of subs...

753
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:45,060
and several surface groups.

754
01:12:45,230 --> 01:12:48,610
- That's a lot of firepower.  - For a rescue team, yes.

755
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,400
And there's something else strange.

756
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:52,030
They're using sonar as if they're looking for something, but nobody's listening.

757
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:55,280
What do you mean?

758
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:57,830
At their speed of 30 knots,

759
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,830
they could run over my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

760
01:13:02,290 --> 01:13:05,330
They're not trying to find Ramius, they're trying to drive him.

761
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,330
Drive him where?

762
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,920
Hounds to the hunters.

763
01:13:13,090 --> 01:13:17,510
Your sub captain is going to make it to America, Mr. Ryan.

764
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:20,850
He's going to die within sight of it.

765
01:13:21,010 --> 01:13:25,730
His wing man kept requesting permission to fire.

766
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:31,060
omebody messes up, we'll be in the biggest naval battle since the Jutland. Jesus!

767
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:36,190
- The water's too cold to eject.  - Air boss will try to bring him aboard.

768
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:40,490
- Excuse me, sir. What's this sub off by herself?  - Bart Mancuso's boat.

769
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:43,950
He's going to the bottom of Red Route One.

770
01:13:44,120 --> 01:13:48,670
He's had intermittent contact with a magma displacement. He's got this...

771
01:13:48,830 --> 01:13:52,920
Magma displacement? Is that like a seismic anomaly?

772
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:55,900
I suppose so. Why?

773
01:13:55,900 --> 01:13:58,720
- Is there a way you could get me on board the Dallas?  - What for?

774
01:13:58,880 --> 01:14:01,780
Help Captain Mancuso found the Red October.

775
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:04,680
He hasn't found anything, Jack. He's just waiting.

776
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:07,180
Excuse me, sir.

777
01:14:07,180 --> 01:14:09,520
But this silent propulsion system could easily be mistaken for something...

778
01:14:09,690 --> 01:14:13,150
Jack, the only way to get you to the Dallas out there is by chopper.

779
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:18,240
is to use a chopper turned into a flying gas can.

780
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:23,450
Excuse me, Admiral. Yankee One is on final. Rescue personnel are in place.

781
01:14:23,620 --> 01:14:26,330
Pick up your left wing.

782
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,870
Power! Wave off!

783
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:32,040
Eject!

784
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:51,060
This business will get out of control and we'll be lucky to live through it.

785
01:15:03,780 --> 01:15:06,040
The bird's loaded down with enough fuel to get you there,

786
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:08,040
but Dallas may not be there.

787
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,960
We're trying to get message to her.

788
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:13,710
If she's gone deep, it's dodgey. If you have to ditch...

789
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:25,430
If you have to ditch, don't think about anything but the survival gear.

790
01:15:25,600 --> 01:15:31,520
At this water temperature, you'll have about four minutes.

791
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:37,860
I'll try to remember that. Next time, Jack, write a goddamn memo.

792
01:16:10,930 --> 01:16:14,650
- Is the captain sacked out?  - Yeah.

793
01:16:15,810 --> 01:16:19,860
- What about him?  - He won't leave.

794
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:33,080
You know, I've seen a mermaid once.

795
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:37,170
I've even seen a shark eat an octopus.

796
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:41,590
But I've never seen a phantom Russian submarine.

797
01:17:20,210 --> 01:17:23,690
We're emerging from the route, Captain.

798
01:17:23,690 --> 01:17:25,180
I've ordered a routine clearing of the baffles.

799
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:27,180
We'll be making the first turn in a few minutes.

800
01:17:27,340 --> 01:17:33,430
The caterpillar is operational and appears to be running normally.

801
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:39,480
The crew know about the saboteur and they are afraid.

802
01:17:41,400 --> 01:17:45,360
Well, that could be useful when the time comes.

803
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:53,120
You know, we could make the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

804
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:56,910
Half of them would freeze before they were rescued.

805
01:17:57,080 --> 01:18:01,130
It's Massachusetts or Maine in 48 hours.

806
01:18:01,290 --> 01:18:04,500
Two days.

807
01:18:11,050 --> 01:18:16,100
Do you think they will let me live in Montana?

808
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:26,610
I would think they'll let you live wherever you want.

809
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:32,200
Good, then I will live in Montana.

810
01:18:32,370 --> 01:18:37,160
I will marry a round American woman and raise rabbits.

811
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:40,830
And she will cook them for me.

812
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:44,670
And I will have a pickup truck.

813
01:18:44,840 --> 01:18:51,130
Or possibly even a recreational vehicle...

814
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:55,310
and drive from state to state.

815
01:18:55,470 --> 01:18:59,600
- Do they let you do that?  - Yes.

816
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:04,440
- No papers?  - No papers. State to state.

817
01:19:04,610 --> 01:19:07,820
All right. Commence your turn.

818
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:17,080
Well then... in winter, I will live in Arizona.

819
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:22,830
- Actually, I think I will need two wives.  - Oh, at least.

820
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:39,270
- Possible aspect change on target.  - Sonar, Concur, change in bearing rate.

821
01:19:42,730 --> 01:19:46,980
- Conn! Sonar! Crazy Ivan!  - All stop. Quick quiet!

822
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:57,890
What's going on, Jonesy?

823
01:19:57,890 --> 01:20:01,120
Russian captains sometimes turn suddenly to see if anyone's behind them.

824
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:04,630
We call it Crazy Ivan.

825
01:20:04,790 --> 01:20:07,460
The only thing you can do is go dead, shut everything down...

826
01:20:07,460 --> 01:20:10,130
and make like a hole in the water.

827
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:16,930
- So what's the catch? - Catch is a boat this big doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

828
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:22,560
If we're too close, we'll drift right into the back of him.

829
01:20:24,730 --> 01:20:28,190
What about you? What do you look forward to?

830
01:20:37,450 --> 01:20:42,960
I have no such appetites.

831
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:46,960
Let's see if he can hear us.

832
01:20:51,670 --> 01:20:54,170
There must be something.

833
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:05,270
What is it?

834
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:12,030
I miss the peace of fishing.

835
01:21:12,190 --> 01:21:15,900
Like when I was a boy.

836
01:21:17,450 --> 01:21:24,080
40 years I've been sailing at sea. A war at sea.

837
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:33,090
A war with no battles. No monuments.

838
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,680
Only casualties.

839
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:44,020
I widowed her the day I married her.

840
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:50,690
My wife died while I was at sea.

841
01:22:09,330 --> 01:22:12,420
Post guards in the engineering spaces.

842
01:22:12,590 --> 01:22:17,420
If he can get to the caterpillar, he can get to somewhere more vital.

843
01:22:20,340 --> 01:22:23,160
Where is he, Jonesy?

844
01:22:23,160 --> 01:22:25,970
Conn, Sonar. Target is now coming out of our starboard baffles.

845
01:22:26,140 --> 01:22:30,480
My read is that he's returning to base course.

846
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:36,360
- Concur, he's returning to course 210.  - He went right around us.

847
01:22:36,530 --> 01:22:41,570
Give him another 30 seconds. Then secure from silent running.

848
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:46,370
Captain, here's what we got on the ELF.

849
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:50,920
- Thanks.  - Aye, sir.

850
01:22:58,090 --> 01:23:01,930
What is it?

851
01:23:02,090 --> 01:23:05,180
You're not going to believe this.

852
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,650
Commander, we're approaching no return.

853
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:21,820
Dallas apparently hasn't gotten the message.

854
01:23:21,990 --> 01:23:24,220
- We have to turn back.  - Give it a couple more minutes.

855
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:26,450
Negative. Fuel status says we turn around now.

856
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:30,750
Wait a minute. Fuel status? You got a reserve, don't you?

857
01:23:30,910 --> 01:23:32,980
Yes, sir. I've got a ten minute reserve.

858
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:35,040
But I'm not allowed to invade that except during war.

859
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:39,970
Mr. If you don't get me on that goddamn submarine, you might have it.

860
01:23:40,130 --> 01:23:44,300
You got 10 minutes worth of fuel. we stay here ten more minutes.

861
01:23:47,810 --> 01:23:53,270
Yo! Mount up! Yo, I got a submarine at around 3:00. About two miles.

862
01:23:55,610 --> 01:23:57,940
Okay, Tony, hook him up.

863
01:23:57,940 --> 01:24:00,280
OK, Commander. I'll be lowering you down to the submarine now.

864
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:05,240
Give me eight minutes. Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

865
01:24:05,410 --> 01:24:11,290
Very well. Surface the ship. Whoever this guy is, he's in for one hell of a ride.

866
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,960
Okay, Commander, go ahead and sit down.

867
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:20,300
- Did you ever do this before?  - Once, on a calm day... off Hawaii.

868
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:24,050
The pilot will have a difficult time keeping steady.

869
01:24:24,220 --> 01:24:27,390
Don't take chances getting grounded. Keep that rod in front of you.

870
01:24:27,550 --> 01:24:32,100
In air like this, the rotors will be putting out enough static to light up Chicago.

871
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:36,730
A diver's in the escape trunk in case this guy goes in the drink.

872
01:24:36,900 --> 01:24:40,570
Someone must have a burr up his ass to go for a stunt like this.

873
01:25:05,010 --> 01:25:08,930
Commander, if I got to bring you back up, I'm going to shake the wire.

874
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:13,980
I'll give you a thumbs up, like this. Remember to cross your arms.

875
01:25:14,140 --> 01:25:17,310
Okay, out you go. Passenger's out the door.

876
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:28,160
He's halfway down. You're drifting forward.

877
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:35,790
All right. Get the hook on his cable.

878
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,000
Watch it! Don't touch him. Okay, here he comes.

879
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,220
It'd be easier without that crosswind. I can't see him.

880
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,560
Don't touch him!

881
01:26:01,150 --> 01:26:05,740
- This is never going to work.  - OK. Reel him back in.

882
01:26:12,700 --> 01:26:15,580
Tony, what's the hell going on back...

883
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:21,380
Dallas, have you got a swimmer?

884
01:26:21,540 --> 01:26:26,170
Man overboard, port side. Send out the diver.

885
01:26:26,340 --> 01:26:30,340
Very well. Dallas, we are history.

886
01:26:37,890 --> 01:26:42,150
Get the doc down here. I'll be in the escape trunk.

887
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:49,240
Down ladder. Make a hole.

888
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:09,550
How do you do, Captain? It's a pleasure to be aboard.

889
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:15,510
I have to talk to the President.

890
01:27:15,680 --> 01:27:19,140
Of course. May I enquire as to the subject?

891
01:27:20,940 --> 01:27:24,250
It seems that the initial reports that...

892
01:27:24,250 --> 01:27:27,570
one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate.

893
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:34,910
The submarine in question is commanded by Captain Marko Ramius.

894
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:40,580
Apparently, he has suffered a kind of mental nervous breakdown.

895
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:48,340
Just before he sailed, he posted a letter to Admiral Padorin...

896
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:51,380
in which he announced his intention to...

897
01:27:53,590 --> 01:27:56,640
to fire his missiles on the United States.

898
01:27:58,310 --> 01:28:01,060
Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met?

899
01:28:01,230 --> 01:28:03,560
In my position I'm sometimes compromised...

900
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,900
by the fact Moscow doesn't always tell me everything.

901
01:28:06,060 --> 01:28:10,860
So one of your submarine captains has gone insane? What do you want from us?

902
01:28:11,030 --> 01:28:14,360
You offered your assistance.

903
01:28:14,360 --> 01:28:17,700
That was a rescue mission. Now you want us to help you hunt him down and kill him.

904
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:24,170
I have been instructed to ask your president for precisely that.

905
01:28:24,330 --> 01:28:29,710
Find him? We already found him. We had to break off to pick you up.

906
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:34,130
- Coffee. A cigarette?  - I don't smoke.

907
01:28:34,300 --> 01:28:39,100
Assuming we can find him, just what exactly am I supposed to do about it?

908
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:43,520
Captain, radio. We're receiving flash traffic on the emergency circuit.

909
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:45,850
Very well. Bring it down.

910
01:28:47,440 --> 01:28:50,150
Well, Mr. Ryan?

911
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:56,410
- Chief, excuse us for a second.  - Leonard, come on out of there.

912
01:29:02,790 --> 01:29:05,790
The sub we're after is called the Red October.

913
01:29:05,790 --> 01:29:08,790
She's under the command of a man named Ramius.

914
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:11,730
Now, there's the possibility that he and a good portion...

915
01:29:11,730 --> 01:29:14,510
of his crew are attempting to defect.

916
01:29:16,930 --> 01:29:19,850
Defect?

917
01:29:20,010 --> 01:29:22,140
Excuse me.

918
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,240
- You say the boat's called the Red October?  - That's right.

919
01:29:41,240 --> 01:29:43,870
- Skipper's Ramius?  - Right.

920
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:49,210
It seems that circumstances have changed somewhat, Mr. Ryan.

921
01:29:56,170 --> 01:30:00,300
- Get this man some dry clothes. I'll be in the conn.  - Aye, sir.

922
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:02,850
"National Command Authority informed Soviet typhoon class submarine...

923
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:05,230
Red October Marko Ramius...

924
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:10,150
is potential renegade and threatens independent missile launch.

925
01:30:10,310 --> 01:30:13,500
"You are authorized to use any necessary force...

926
01:30:13,500 --> 01:30:16,700
to prevent said submarine from approaching the coast of the United States."

927
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:35,960
Left 10 degrees rudder steady on course 265.

928
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,680
Chief of the Watch, rig for red.

929
01:30:52,980 --> 01:30:55,460
- What's going on?  - Battle stations are manned and ready, Captain.

930
01:30:55,460 --> 01:30:57,950
Very well.

931
01:30:58,110 --> 01:31:01,220
Captain, I have to talk to you.

932
01:31:01,220 --> 01:31:04,330
Not now. Tommy, make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down angle.

933
01:31:04,490 --> 01:31:09,830
Diving officer, make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down.

934
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:15,880
Full dive on fair water planes. Full dive on stern planes.

935
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:22,590
Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

936
01:31:22,760 --> 01:31:25,510
500.

937
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:29,690
600.

938
01:31:29,850 --> 01:31:33,150
700.

939
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:40,570
- Did you get a good fix?  - Yes, Captain.

940
01:31:47,160 --> 01:31:52,120
- Sonar, conn, have you got him yet, Jonesy?  - Very faint, sir. Hold on.

941
01:31:53,670 --> 01:31:58,170
Yes, sir. Contact typhoon seven on bearing 250. Right where he's supposed to be.

942
01:31:58,340 --> 01:32:02,880
- Any sign he's alerted to our presence?  - No. Operating as before.

943
01:32:03,050 --> 01:32:08,140
Come left to 265. Bring us up behind him quietly, Tommy.

944
01:32:08,310 --> 01:32:10,890
Make your depth 500 feet.

945
01:32:20,070 --> 01:32:23,490
Please listen to me. Two minutes, that's all.

946
01:32:25,490 --> 01:32:29,750
- Plot, time to intercept his track.  - Four minutes, Captain.

947
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:33,250
Very well, Mr. Ryan. Two minutes.

948
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:43,760
I understand that message, it makes perfect sense. But the situation is...

949
01:32:43,930 --> 01:32:46,260
Ramius intends to defect.

950
01:32:46,260 --> 01:32:48,600
The Russians know this, which is why they've tried to sink him...

951
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:51,020
- But they haven't been able to. So... - I have a firing solution.

952
01:32:51,020 --> 01:32:53,270
Very well.

953
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,540
Captain, you have to listen to me.

954
01:32:55,540 --> 01:32:57,650
The Russians will stop at nothing to prevent Ramius from defecting.

955
01:32:57,810 --> 01:33:00,670
They've invented this story that he's crazy...

956
01:33:00,670 --> 01:33:03,530
because they need us to sink him before he can contact us.

957
01:33:05,860 --> 01:33:11,410
Weapons control, I want full safeties. I don't want this fish coming back.

958
01:33:11,580 --> 01:33:14,830
Captain, I know this man.

959
01:33:15,870 --> 01:33:18,840
Has he made any Crazy Ivans?

960
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,800
- What difference does that make?  - His next one will be to starboard.

961
01:33:21,960 --> 01:33:26,930
Because he goes to starboard in the bottom half of the hour.

962
01:33:29,720 --> 01:33:32,600
Flood tubes one and two. Warm up the weapons.

963
01:33:32,770 --> 01:33:35,310
Captain, find a way to establish contact without violating orders.

964
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:37,310
He wants to defect!

965
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,480
Mr. Thompson, Call Chief Watson to the conn with his sidearm.

966
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:50,910
Conn, Sonar. Signal to noise ratio's dropping. Possible aspect change in target.

967
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:54,410
Possible target zig based on bearing rate.

968
01:33:55,580 --> 01:33:58,170
Conn, Sonar. Crazy Ivan!

969
01:34:00,880 --> 01:34:05,470
Captain, he's turning.

970
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:12,680
- Which way is he turning, Jonesy?  - To the starboard, sir!

971
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:16,560
Give the man a chance.

972
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:21,400
- All back full.  - Captain, say again.

973
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:24,860
- I said all back full!  - Back full. Aye, sir.

974
01:34:29,660 --> 01:34:35,620
- Captain, we're cavitating! He can hear us.  - Conn, aye. All stop.

975
01:34:36,330 --> 01:34:38,870
All right. We just unzipped our fly.

976
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:44,210
Mr. Thompson, open the outer doors. Firing point procedures.

977
01:34:44,380 --> 01:34:48,510
Now, if that bastard so much as twitches, I'm going to blow him right to Mars.

978
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,430
All stop rudder amid ship.

979
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,970
Can you identify the contact?

980
01:34:55,140 --> 01:34:57,770
American Los Angeles-class attack submarine. Bearing: 015. Range: 300 metres.

981
01:34:57,770 --> 01:35:00,400
Captain, sharp metallic transients.

982
01:35:00,560 --> 01:35:03,270
He may be trying to open his torpedo tube doors.

983
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:06,650
Outer doors are open on tubes one and two. We're ready to shoot.

984
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:11,320
Very well. My orders are specific, Mr. Ryan.

985
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:14,580
Captain, he has opened his outer doors. He's preparing to fire.

986
01:35:14,740 --> 01:35:19,580
Flood tubes three and four and plot a solution.

987
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,540
Shall I open the torpedo tube doors, sir?

988
01:35:27,510 --> 01:35:32,840
- Captain, shall I open outer doors?  - No.

989
01:35:33,010 --> 01:35:36,810
Lock the firing solution into the computer.

990
01:35:36,970 --> 01:35:40,020
Do not open the doors.

991
01:35:46,320 --> 01:35:52,280
Aye, Captain. Lock solution into computer.

992
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:57,490
- Conn, Sonar. Target has flooded his tubes.  - Has he opened his outer doors?

993
01:35:57,660 --> 01:36:01,870
Negative, Captain. He's just sitting there. Hold on.

994
01:36:02,580 --> 01:36:07,590
- Target is coming shallow.  - What does that mean?

995
01:36:09,550 --> 01:36:12,720
It means he's a very cool customer, your Russian.

996
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:14,730
He knows we're here and ready to shoot.

997
01:36:14,730 --> 01:36:16,580
He's not provoking us.

998
01:36:16,580 --> 01:36:18,430
He's heading to periscope depth to see what's on the surface.

999
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:22,770
- What's his course now?  - His course is 270. Due west.

1000
01:36:22,940 --> 01:36:26,270
- Bring us alongside him.  - Aye, Captain.

1001
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,480
Sonar, Conn. Report all contacts.

1002
01:36:29,650 --> 01:36:34,030
Conn, Sonar. My only contact is Typhoon 7, bearing 195.

1003
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:39,160
- Very well. Fire control, range to target?  - Range is 300 yards.

1004
01:36:40,660 --> 01:36:45,040
Make your depth 65 feet.

1005
01:36:46,250 --> 01:36:50,510
He wants to go up and take a peek. We'll play along.

1006
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:12,690
- Weapons status?  - Weapons are on.

1007
01:37:12,860 --> 01:37:17,530
Tubes three and four are flooded, but outer doors are closed.

1008
01:37:20,030 --> 01:37:21,930
Mark this bearing.

1009
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:36,130
You wanted to talk to him, Mr. Ryan? There he is. What do you want to say?

1010
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:40,510
- Will he be the only one looking through the periscope?  - Probably.

1011
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:44,020
We'll have to chance that.

1012
01:37:44,180 --> 01:37:48,360
"US told you intend missile launch."

1013
01:37:48,520 --> 01:37:53,940
"Do not approach US coast or you will be attacked."

1014
01:37:54,110 --> 01:37:59,240
"If intention is other, will you discuss option?"

1015
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:03,410
Can he acknowledge with a single ping?

1016
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:07,620
Yeah, he can. The question is, will he?

1017
01:38:14,210 --> 01:38:19,850
Verify our range to target. One ping only.

1018
01:38:21,260 --> 01:38:23,850
Aye, Captain.

1019
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:32,900
I'll be damned. Now what?

1020
01:38:35,150 --> 01:38:39,200
All right. "If defection..."

1021
01:38:45,950 --> 01:38:50,630
Chart. I need a chart.

1022
01:38:52,710 --> 01:38:57,510
OK. Where the hell are we? Someplace deep. Someplace deep...

1023
01:38:59,930 --> 01:39:03,560
Okay, send him this.

1024
01:39:06,850 --> 01:39:11,150
- Are you out of your mind?  - Just send it.

1025
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:19,610
Tell me one thing. How did you know he was going to go to starboard?

1026
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:25,240
I didn't. I had a 50-50 chance and I needed a break. Sorry.

1027
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:30,580
That's all right, Mr. Ryan. My Morse is so rusty...

1028
01:39:30,750 --> 01:39:35,210
I may be sending him dimensions on playmate of the month.

1029
01:39:53,900 --> 01:39:57,190
Reverify our range to target.

1030
01:39:57,360 --> 01:40:01,860
- One ping only.  - Captain, I just...

1031
01:40:02,030 --> 01:40:06,370
Give me a ping, Vassily. One ping only, please.

1032
01:40:09,330 --> 01:40:11,750
Aye, Captain.

1033
01:40:15,590 --> 01:40:18,840
What the hell is this about?

1034
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:24,760
The Russians want us to sink her. We might have to do that.

1035
01:40:32,480 --> 01:40:36,480
We must give this American a wide berth.

1036
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:41,190
And let us turn south.

1037
01:40:49,490 --> 01:40:55,960
Mr. Kamarov, plot a new course due south.

1038
01:40:58,130 --> 01:41:01,050
New course: 180.

1039
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:38,170
- Shut down the reactor.  - Aye, sir.

1040
01:41:38,340 --> 01:41:43,300
- Seal the ventilation system.  - The ventilation controls have failed.

1041
01:41:43,470 --> 01:41:47,760
Everybody out! Clear the compartment.

1042
01:41:58,190 --> 01:42:02,650
- Ventilation system, shut it down now.  - They don't respond.

1043
01:42:02,820 --> 01:42:06,530
Bypass it. Seal it manually. Move!

1044
01:42:07,860 --> 01:42:10,660
Melekhin, say again.

1045
01:42:17,580 --> 01:42:20,590
Suffered a leak in the primary coolant tube...

1046
01:42:20,590 --> 01:42:23,590
so shut down the reactor, but the ventilation circuits have been disabled.

1047
01:42:23,760 --> 01:42:26,420
The coolant appears highly contaminated.

1048
01:42:26,420 --> 01:42:29,090
I knew there was damage when the caterpillar went down.

1049
01:42:29,260 --> 01:42:31,040
Captain, radiation alarms are activated in all compartments.

1050
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,600
Engineering is heavily contaminated, and radiation's moving forward.

1051
01:42:34,770 --> 01:42:37,310
Get us to periscope depth. We'll ventilate with outside air.

1052
01:42:37,310 --> 01:42:39,860
Aye, Captain. Periscope depth.

1053
01:42:40,020 --> 01:42:44,360
Prepare to ventilate! Ventilating won't do anything. We've got to get them off.

1054
01:42:44,530 --> 01:42:48,450
- What is the battery condition?  - Four hours. Six, if we're cautious.

1055
01:42:48,610 --> 01:42:51,280
Engage battery system.

1056
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:52,950
Captain, we've got a level one radiation leak.

1057
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:53,950
Every surface of this ship's contaminated.

1058
01:42:54,120 --> 01:42:57,580
We've got to get the men off.

1059
01:42:57,750 --> 01:43:00,830
Sir, we have been sabotaged.

1060
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:04,460
- Who said anything about sabotage?  - Captain!

1061
01:43:04,630 --> 01:43:07,970
Sir, I'm afraid the doctor's right.

1062
01:43:12,390 --> 01:43:17,980
Very well. Surface. We'll evacuate the men to the deck.

1063
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:23,230
Captain. Surface the ship. Prepare to muster all personnel to escape hatches.

1064
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:27,160
Break out the rafts. Lash them to the deck.

1065
01:43:27,200 --> 01:43:30,160
We'll use them as shelters until the fleet arrives.

1066
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:18,040
- Make sure the count is accurate, Doctor. - We must get the entire crew out.

1067
01:44:18,200 --> 01:44:25,130
- Master at Arms reports rafts secure and evacuation proceeding.  - Very good.

1068
01:44:30,670 --> 01:44:32,660
We'll rotate through the conn.

1069
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:34,660
No officer will spend more than 20 minutes below deck.

1070
01:44:34,660 --> 01:44:38,640
Completely, Captain.

1071
01:44:38,810 --> 01:44:44,900
Surface contact: 270. Six miles and closing fast.

1072
01:44:45,060 --> 01:44:48,940
- It's a warship!  - Here? Can you identify?

1073
01:44:49,110 --> 01:44:54,780
It's a frigate, U.S, probably, Perry class. He's signaling.

1074
01:44:54,950 --> 01:45:00,700
Red October, Red October, halt and stay where you are.

1075
01:45:00,870 --> 01:45:04,370
Do not attempt to submerge or you will be fired upon.

1076
01:45:07,130 --> 01:45:09,960
Captain, I think he means to board us.

1077
01:45:16,180 --> 01:45:21,810
You will go with the crew. The officers and I will submerge beneath you...

1078
01:45:21,980 --> 01:45:27,270
- and scuttle the ship. - You will receive the Order of Lenin for this, Captain.

1079
01:45:37,240 --> 01:45:42,790
Prepare to cast off. The captain is going to scuttle the ship.

1080
01:45:47,630 --> 01:45:52,050
- He's going down, sir.  - Put a shot across his bow. Come right at 180.

1081
01:46:22,450 --> 01:46:25,210
Seahawk One, this is Bravo Command.

1082
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:47,020
She's ready.

1083
01:46:47,190 --> 01:46:49,980
Seahawk One, release on my command.

1084
01:46:50,150 --> 01:46:52,730
Drop now...now...now.

1085
01:47:01,330 --> 01:47:05,870
Range to target 900 yards... 800 yards...

1086
01:47:08,120 --> 01:47:13,500
700 yards... 600 yards...

1087
01:47:18,590 --> 01:47:24,060
500 yards... 400 yards...

1088
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:28,690
300 yards.

1089
01:47:31,150 --> 01:47:34,150
The torpedo is detonated.

1090
01:47:34,320 --> 01:47:37,610
Now, understand, Commander...

1091
01:47:37,610 --> 01:47:40,910
that torpedo did not self-destruct. You heard it hit the hull.

1092
01:47:41,070 --> 01:47:45,040
And I was never here.

1093
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:50,370
- Contact Dallas. Give them the go.  - Advise Dallas. Get the DSRV moving.

1094
01:47:59,050 --> 01:48:03,050
Two million things can still go wrong with this stunt.

1095
01:48:03,220 --> 01:48:08,890
Central Intelligence Agency... there's a contradiction in terms.

1096
01:48:09,940 --> 01:48:12,770
How's the coffee, Ryan?

1097
01:48:12,940 --> 01:48:18,610
Dallas, this is the Mystic. Request clearance to launch.

1098
01:48:19,900 --> 01:48:25,950
- Hatch is secured.  - Life support, normal. Prelaunch checks complete.

1099
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:31,500
- Flood the skirt.  - Skirt filled and equalized.

1100
01:48:31,670 --> 01:48:36,090
- Ready to lift off.  - Okay, let's do it.

1101
01:48:38,710 --> 01:48:41,590
Thrusting to port.

1102
01:49:01,320 --> 01:49:07,410
- 600 yards and closing.  - Steer right to course 075.

1103
01:49:12,370 --> 01:49:17,590
200 yards... 100 yards.

1104
01:49:24,970 --> 01:49:27,550
Hit the lights.

1105
01:49:39,780 --> 01:49:43,200
Jesus! That's a big sucker.

1106
01:49:59,380 --> 01:50:03,630
- Okay, we're in position.  - You can open the hatch.

1107
01:50:03,800 --> 01:50:10,310
Hold it a second. Jonesy...  Mr. Ryan.

1108
01:50:13,680 --> 01:50:18,980
- He's defecting.  - And he can't change his mind?

1109
01:50:19,150 --> 01:50:24,190
- He's not going to change his mind.  - Will you bet your life on that?

1110
01:50:44,260 --> 01:50:47,630
- Sir, could you hand me that hammer?  - Yeah.

1111
01:51:09,910 --> 01:51:14,160
Americans.

1112
01:52:53,550 --> 01:52:56,810
He's turning green.

1113
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:18,740
There's our buckaroo.

1114
01:53:19,910 --> 01:53:23,170
What's so funny?

1115
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:27,340
The captain thinks you're some sort of cowboy.

1116
01:53:27,500 --> 01:53:35,180
- You speak Russian.  - A little.

1117
01:53:35,340 --> 01:53:41,480
It's wise to study the ways of one's adversary.

1118
01:53:41,640 --> 01:53:43,730
It is.

1119
01:53:45,730 --> 01:53:50,690
I doubt you'd remember, but we met once at the consulate in Leningrad.

1120
01:53:50,860 --> 01:53:56,450
Along with your wife. I'm very sorry.

1121
01:53:56,620 --> 01:54:01,370
What gives you the right to fire on my ship?

1122
01:54:01,540 --> 01:54:05,790
- Your signal said nothing of a torpedo.  - Ryan.

1123
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,860
It was necessary to maintain the illusion for your crew.

1124
01:54:09,860 --> 01:54:12,670
My crew are being rescued, yes?

1125
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:16,800
As we speak.

1126
01:54:18,930 --> 01:54:24,020
- You sent the signal?  - That's correct, sir.

1127
01:54:24,180 --> 01:54:30,110
Then how did you know our reactor accident was false?

1128
01:54:30,270 --> 01:54:33,400
That was a guess, but it seemed logical.

1129
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,830
Very well.

1130
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:51,090
I present to you the ballistic missile submarine Red October.

1131
01:54:55,300 --> 01:55:01,850
My officers and I request asylum in the United States of America.

1132
01:55:04,220 --> 01:55:09,690
It's a pleasure, sir. Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1133
01:55:11,900 --> 01:55:14,630
Torpedo. The Americans are shooting at us again.

1134
01:55:14,630 --> 01:55:18,060
The pitch is too high. The torpedo's Russian.

1135
01:55:18,130 --> 01:55:21,380
What do you mean another torpedo? Where the hell did it come from?

1136
01:55:21,450 --> 01:55:25,450
Conn, Sonar. New contact. Sierra 4-1. Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1137
01:55:28,790 --> 01:55:32,110
Sonar, why don't I have a detonation?

1138
01:55:32,110 --> 01:55:33,720
The weapon enabled on the far side of the target.

1139
01:55:33,730 --> 01:55:35,420
It passed Red October before arming.

1140
01:55:35,590 --> 01:55:39,640
You had the wrong range. Fire again with the right setting and reload both tubes.

1141
01:55:39,800 --> 01:55:44,770
Get me power, and get that damn thing off my boat.

1142
01:55:44,930 --> 01:55:50,230
- I think somebody shot a torpedo at us.  - No shit, Buckwheat. Get out of here.

1143
01:55:58,570 --> 01:56:02,990
The captain is fighting them.

1144
01:56:05,870 --> 01:56:09,080
Borodin, fire control.

1145
01:56:09,250 --> 01:56:14,090
- Ryan, sit here.  - I'm not a naval officer. I'm with the CIA.

1146
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:18,470
- CIA?  - I'm not an agent. I just write books for the CIA.

1147
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:22,840
Whatever. Sit down. And do exactly what I tell you.

1148
01:56:23,010 --> 01:56:26,520
DSRV's away. There's a Russian alfa 8,000 yards to starboard.

1149
01:56:26,680 --> 01:56:32,900
- Captain, I think it's the Konovalov.  - Increase to flank.

1150
01:56:33,020 --> 01:56:38,030
- Increase to flank. How?  - That knob. Turn right full.

1151
01:56:38,190 --> 01:56:42,240
- All ahead flank. Right full rudder.  - He's shooting again, sir.

1152
01:56:42,410 --> 01:56:45,580
Put battle stations.

1153
01:56:50,580 --> 01:56:55,290
- Torpedo in the water. Bearing 315.  - Make range 7,000 yards.

1154
01:56:55,460 --> 01:57:01,930
- Steer right 315.  - That's heading into the torpedo.

1155
01:57:02,090 --> 01:57:08,430
- Estimate range 6,000 yards.  - Steer right 315.

1156
01:57:08,600 --> 01:57:12,850
No, that's wrong! Ryan, don't turn that goddamn wheel.

1157
01:57:13,020 --> 01:57:16,270
315.

1158
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:30,700
- You're heading straight for that torpedo.  - Yes.

1159
01:57:30,870 --> 01:57:34,880
- Doing what?  - He's turned into the torpedo's path.

1160
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,590
- What?  - Red October's turned directly into the torpedo's path, sir.

1161
01:57:37,590 --> 01:57:40,130
- Red October's turned directly into the torpedo's path, sir.  - Mother of God!

1162
01:57:40,300 --> 01:57:44,840
Torpedo steady, bearing 315. Range: 5,000 yards.

1163
01:57:45,010 --> 01:57:49,010
- Melekhin, more speed.  - Negative. We're already at 110%.

1164
01:57:49,180 --> 01:57:54,810
- Then give it run at 115%.  - Estimate range: 3,000 yards. Closing awfully fast.

1165
01:58:01,530 --> 01:58:03,040
He's heading right at the torpedo.

1166
01:58:03,040 --> 01:58:04,550
What's he trying to do, kill himself?

1167
01:58:04,550 --> 01:58:06,060
We have a firing solution...

1168
01:58:06,060 --> 01:58:07,570
on the Russian alfa. Can we shoot back?

1169
01:58:07,740 --> 01:58:12,500
They didn't shoot at us. I can't attack a Soviet submarine without authorization.

1170
01:58:15,120 --> 01:58:20,710
Torpedo bearing steady at 315. Last range: 900 yards.

1171
01:58:20,880 --> 01:58:25,130
Torpedo impact: 20 seconds.

1172
01:58:26,430 --> 01:58:30,600
- What books?  - Pardon me?

1173
01:58:30,760 --> 01:58:36,270
- What books did you write?  - A biography on Admiral Halsey...

1174
01:58:36,440 --> 01:58:43,030
- called The Fighting Sailor, about naval combat tactics.  - I know this book.

1175
01:58:43,190 --> 01:58:48,070
Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.

1176
01:58:48,240 --> 01:58:53,330
Nine, eight, seven, six...

1177
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:59,330
five, four, three, two...

1178
01:58:59,500 --> 01:59:02,750
Torpedo impact... now.

1179
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:15,930
I'll be dammed.

1180
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:20,610
- What happened?  - Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

1181
01:59:20,770 --> 01:59:22,820
By turning into the torpedo,

1182
01:59:22,870 --> 01:59:26,820
the captain closed the distance before it could arm itself.

1183
01:59:26,990 --> 01:59:29,820
- So that's it?  - Not quite.

1184
01:59:29,990 --> 01:59:33,620
Right now, Captain Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons.

1185
01:59:33,620 --> 01:59:37,250
He won't make the same mistake twice.

1186
01:59:37,410 --> 01:59:42,750
- Vasily, have you plotted a solution yet?  - It's a little rough, but I...

1187
01:59:49,260 --> 01:59:52,390
- Gunfire.  - That's what it sounded like, sir.

1188
01:59:52,550 --> 01:59:56,390
- He won't change his mind, Mr. Ryan.  - It's one of the crew.

1189
01:59:56,560 --> 02:00:00,400
Well, Whoever he is, I'd say he's having second thoughts.

1190
02:00:16,410 --> 02:00:19,830
I would like to have seen Montana.

1191
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:35,950
Captain, he stumbled forward into the missile bay.

1192
02:00:35,950 --> 02:00:38,980
There's a silo hatch warning... port side, number 20.

1193
02:00:39,140 --> 02:00:43,310
- He can't launch a missile?  - No, but he can blow one up.

1194
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:48,610
Captain, take the conn. Fire control's blasted to hell.

1195
02:00:48,620 --> 02:00:50,610
Get in behind him and stay there.

1196
02:00:50,780 --> 02:00:53,490
Captain, wait.

1197
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:59,290
You may need this, sir.

1198
02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:04,290
Thank you.

1199
02:01:06,920 --> 02:01:09,900
Don't just stand there, Ryan, go with him!

1200
02:01:09,900 --> 02:01:11,390
- You, you speak English?  - Yes, sir.

1201
02:01:11,390 --> 02:01:12,880
get your butt over here.

1202
02:01:13,050 --> 02:01:16,390
Captain, torpedo broke off on impact.

1203
02:01:16,390 --> 02:01:18,060
Goddamn it! Set the safety ranges for zero now.

1204
02:01:18,060 --> 02:01:19,730
Captain, I can't go any faster.

1205
02:01:19,890 --> 02:01:24,440
We must get him before he gets to the ignition circuits.

1206
02:01:31,570 --> 02:01:35,120
What happens if he gets to that ignition circuitry?

1207
02:01:35,280 --> 02:01:38,290
He can incinerate the ship.

1208
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:50,340
- That door is the only way out of here?  - Yes.

1209
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:55,680
- Don't let him get past you.  - Ryan...

1210
02:01:55,840 --> 02:01:59,220
Be careful what you shoot at.

1211
02:01:59,390 --> 02:02:04,230
Most things in here don't react too well to bullets.

1212
02:02:06,100 --> 02:02:08,730
Right.

1213
02:02:26,040 --> 02:02:28,960
Be careful what I shoot at?

1214
02:02:37,220 --> 02:02:41,310
- Safety ranges set to zero.  - Sonar, give me the bearing for Red October.

1215
02:02:41,470 --> 02:02:47,190
- She's taking positioned behind us.  - Right full rudder. I'll shake the man loose.

1216
02:02:53,400 --> 02:02:57,070
- He's going deep.  - 30 degree down angle.

1217
02:02:57,240 --> 02:02:59,910
All the countermeasures were over there, right? Very well.

1218
02:03:25,350 --> 02:03:29,400
Admiral, the alfa's too quick. It's only a matter of time on search.

1219
02:03:29,560 --> 02:03:34,650
"Ryan, some things in here don't react well to bullets..."

1220
02:03:34,820 --> 02:03:38,610
Yeah, like me. I don't react well to bullets.

1221
02:03:58,220 --> 02:04:01,430
- Where is he, Jonesy?  - Close, sir.

1222
02:04:03,350 --> 02:04:06,850
- 900 meters, directly ahead.  - Got him.

1223
02:04:07,020 --> 02:04:10,190
- Mark bearings and fire.  - We are too close.

1224
02:04:10,350 --> 02:04:15,730
Don't argue with me. Do it now!

1225
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:20,700
Another torpedo. It went active the moment it was launched.

1226
02:04:20,860 --> 02:04:25,660
- Left full rudder. Ease off on your bow planes.  - I think he's got us.

1227
02:04:35,590 --> 02:04:39,010
Way to go, Dallas!

1228
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:47,890
Torpedo is in acquisition. Range 500 yards and closing. You've done it, Thompson!

1229
02:04:48,060 --> 02:04:52,350
I hope this works. All right, chief, put us on the roof.

1230
02:04:52,520 --> 02:04:55,980
Countermeasure station, on my mark. 5, 4...

1231
02:04:58,690 --> 02:05:03,820
Release counter measures. Emergency blow. Full rise.

1232
02:05:11,000 --> 02:05:14,590
500 feet.

1233
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:18,170
Come on, Big D. Fly!

1234
02:05:37,020 --> 02:05:40,690
That torpedo is still active. It's searching for another target, now.

1235
02:06:05,930 --> 02:06:11,140
A goddamn cook.

1236
02:06:33,960 --> 02:06:37,080
Torpedo is locked on us!

1237
02:06:37,250 --> 02:06:40,050
- How close is that Alfa, Jonesy?  - 1,000 yards dead astern, going to port.

1238
02:06:40,050 --> 02:06:42,840
- Reverse your turn.  - Aye,sir.

1239
02:06:48,300 --> 02:06:52,560
We're turning straight at him. Torpedo's still on our tail.

1240
02:06:56,440 --> 02:07:01,230
The hard part about playing chicken is knowing when to flinch.

1241
02:07:06,610 --> 02:07:10,660
Collision in 400 yards, 350, 300...

1242
02:07:10,830 --> 02:07:16,540
- Captain!  - Right full rudder. 30 degree down angle.

1243
02:07:16,710 --> 02:07:20,170
This one's going to be close.

1244
02:07:23,090 --> 02:07:26,840
You arrogant ass, you've killed us.

1245
02:07:55,200 --> 02:07:58,330
We have ascertained the Red October's final position.

1246
02:07:58,960 --> 02:08:01,920
But...given the depth of the water and the spread of...

1247
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:04,880
the wreckage spreads across a wide area...

1248
02:08:05,050 --> 02:08:07,970
it'll be some time before anything's recovered.

1249
02:08:08,130 --> 02:08:10,950
However, your people are interviewing...

1250
02:08:10,950 --> 02:08:13,760
the crew now and making arrangements for their return.

1251
02:08:13,930 --> 02:08:18,270
This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador.

1252
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:23,690
And I can only stress hat if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avoided.

1253
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:30,700
- I appreciate your candor in the matter.  - And I yours, Andrei.

1254
02:08:33,450 --> 02:08:36,290
Perhaps in the future...

1255
02:08:36,290 --> 02:08:39,120
the technology will be available for an investigation of the wreckage.

1256
02:08:39,290 --> 02:08:43,170
Perhaps.

1257
02:08:47,460 --> 02:08:53,850
- There is another matter, one that I'm reluctant to...  - Please.

1258
02:08:55,350 --> 02:09:02,440
One of our submarines, an Alfa, was last reported in the area of the Grand Banks.

1259
02:09:02,600 --> 02:09:06,860
We've not heard from her for some time.

1260
02:09:08,150 --> 02:09:12,700
Andrei. You've lost another submarine?

1261
02:09:27,090 --> 02:09:31,590
All this way to hide a submarine in a river.

1262
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,870
We're 100 miles from the nearest naval base...

1263
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:38,930
for the last place that satellites will ever look.

1264
02:09:40,430 --> 02:09:44,310
I grew up around here.

1265
02:09:44,480 --> 02:09:49,820
My grandfather taught me to fish off that island over there.

1266
02:09:52,860 --> 02:09:59,830
There is one question you haven't asked me yet. Why?

1267
02:10:01,620 --> 02:10:04,960
Well, I figured you would tell me when you were ready.

1268
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:12,510
Now, there are those who believe we should attack the United States first.

1269
02:10:12,670 --> 02:10:19,180
Settle everything in one moment. Red October was built for that purpose.

1270
02:10:19,350 --> 02:10:24,900
When the dust settles from this, there's going to be hell to pay in Moscow.

1271
02:10:25,060 --> 02:10:28,270
Maybe some good will come from it.

1272
02:10:28,440 --> 02:10:34,110
A little revolution now and then is a healthy thing, do you think?

1273
02:10:39,910 --> 02:10:43,710
- Do you still like to fish, Ryan?  - Mmm.

1274
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:49,040
There's a river, not unlike this one, near Vilnius...

1275
02:10:49,210 --> 02:10:53,880
where my grandfather taught me to fish.

1276
02:10:54,930 --> 02:10:59,680
"And the sea will grant each man new hope."

1277
02:10:59,850 --> 02:11:03,560
"As sleep brings dreams."

1278
02:11:09,610 --> 02:11:12,320
Christopher Columbus.

1279
02:11:16,200 --> 02:11:19,580
