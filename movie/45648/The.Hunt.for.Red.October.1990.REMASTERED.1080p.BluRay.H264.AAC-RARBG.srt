斯坦利一直吵醒我
Stanley keeps waking me up.

24

00:04:56,498 --> 00:04:58,333
你越来越重了

已讲过两个故事和喝两杯水了

好吧，小蟋蟀，听我说

现在跟维勒夫人上楼去睡觉
Go upstairs with Mrs. Wheeler now and go to sleep.

31
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:15,350
我出差回来的时候，会给斯坦利带来一个弟弟
On my business trip, I'll get Stanley a little brother.

32
00:05:15,644 --> 00:05:16,800
你保证？

不用了，谢谢
No, thank you very much.

37
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,810
如果你试着睡一下的话，时间会过得快些
If you try and get sleep, the flight will go faster.

38
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:04,190
我在飞机上睡不着

39
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:05,691
因为乱流
Turbulence.

40
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:06,980
什么？
Pardon?

41
00:06:08,111 --> 00:06:10,613
乱流，太阳辐射加热了地表
Turbulence. Solar radiation heats the earth's crust,

我不想问你旅途的情况

你上次睡觉是什么时候？

卡洛琳还好吗？
So how's Caroline?

57
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:41,621
我们上次见面
Last time I saw her

58
00:07:41,704 --> 00:07:44,833
是在你缅因州爷爷家吧？
was at your granddad's place in Maine, wasn't it?

59
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:48,169
她很好，她要我问候你
She's fine. Sends you her best.

60
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,738
莎莉呢？
And Sally?

61
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,396
她很好
She's fine.

62
00:07:51,636 --> 00:07:53,366
她现在几岁了，三岁？
What is she now, three?

63
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:56,624
不，她是个早熟的五岁小孩
No, she's a very precocious five.

64
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:01,084
她前几天才对我们说
She announced to Caroline and I the other day

65
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,970
如果我们买个弟弟给她
that her life would be considerably less lonely

66
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,098
她就不会这么孤独
if we were to buy her a baby brother.

67
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,853
但是…
But...

68
00:08:09,098 --> 00:08:11,730
后来她决定只要帮斯坦利买个弟弟就够了
she decided it would be enough if we were to buy one for Stanley.

69
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,170
谁是斯坦利？
Who's Stanley?

70
00:08:15,942 --> 00:08:17,280
斯坦利是一只玩具熊
Stanley's a bear.

71
00:08:20,743 --> 00:08:24,289
好吧，到底是什么大事？
All right. What's important enough to get you on a plane

72
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:26,020
让你在连夜赶来这？
in the middle of the night?

73
00:08:26,511 --> 00:08:29,181
两天前英国情报局拿到这些照片
British Intelligence obtained these pictures two days ago.

74
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:30,500
她是红色十月
She's the Red October,

75
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:32,797
最新型的台风级潜艇
the latest Typhoon class.

76
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,757
真是个大家伙
Big son of a bitch.

77
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,112
比一般的台风级潜艇
Twelve meters longer than the standard Typhoon.

78

长度多12米，宽多3米

79
00:08:39,335 --> 00:08:41,043
舰长叫雷米思

80
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,430
- 你认识他？  - 对，我去年为他写过自传
- One of yours? - Yeah. I did his bio last year.

81
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:48,980
过去十年他一直是苏联新潜艇的试航指挥官
He's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for 10 years.

82
00:08:49,063 --> 00:08:50,857
政界关系良好
Fairly good political connections.

83
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,068
大部分的舰长都是他训练的
Trained most of their attack boat skippers.

84
00:08:54,152 --> 00:08:57,739
俄国人称他为维尔纽斯总教头
The Russians call him Vilnius nastavnik.

85
00:08:58,323 --> 00:09:01,159
维尔纽斯司令

86
00:09:02,047 --> 00:09:03,363
这些门做什么用的？
What are these doors?

87
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:04,720
那些门
Those doors, sir,

88
00:09:05,007 --> 00:09:06,378
正是问题所在
are the problem.

89
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:09,709
我不知道它们是什么，英国人也不清楚
I don't know what they are. Neither do the British.

90
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:13,796
也许我们在摩尔曼斯克的朋友又发明些新东西了
Perhaps our friends in Murmansk have come up with something new.

91
00:09:14,797 --> 00:09:17,091
我想把这些照片拿给别人看看
With your permission, I'd like to show these to someone.

92
00:09:17,175 --> 00:09:19,177

99
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,698
（玻利尼亚湾西北100哩处）

100
00:10:23,491 --> 00:10:25,493
你听到了吗？
Do you hear it?

101
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:28,162
没有
No.

102
00:10:28,496 --> 00:10:31,207
博蒙特，以前我们在学校时一边睡都能做这档事
Beaumont, at Cal Tech we used to do this in our sleep.

103
00:10:31,332 --> 00:10:33,001
现在听到了吗？
You hear it now?

104
00:10:34,168 --> 00:10:36,879
等一下，或许…
Wait a minute. Maybe.

105
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:41,316
- 被海面的波浪声盖住了？  - 对
- It's buried in surface clutter? - Yes.

106
00:10:41,964 --> 00:10:43,540
- 现在应该用分析仪？  - 没错
- I should go to SAPS? - Correct,

107
00:10:43,722 --> 00:10:45,142
希曼・博蒙特
Seaman Beaumont.

108
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:49,392
利用声纳分析处理系统

109
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:51,868
再学一个星期，你就能回加州理工教书了
Give it a week, and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

110
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:54,588
所以…
So...

111
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,900
就像贝多芬在电脑上谱曲Like Beethoven on the computer,

112
00:10:58,555 --> 00:11:00,566
透过分析仪分析结果
you have labored to produce

113
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:09,704
一种生物
a biologic.

114
00:11:11,352 --> 00:11:12,284
什么？
A what?

115
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,842
鲸鱼，博蒙特，一头鲸鱼
A whale, Beaumont. A whale.

116
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:18,988
一种更懂声纳系统的海洋哺乳动物
A marine mammal that knows a hell of a lot more about sonar

117
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,097
比你懂
than you do.

118
00:11:20,582 --> 00:11:21,570
关掉分析仪
Kill the SAPS.

119
00:11:21,912 --> 00:11:24,000
对准269航道
Train over to 2-6-9 and...

120
00:11:24,842 --> 00:11:26,088
我们再试一次
let's try it again.

121
00:11:26,265 --> 00:11:27,760
小子，他如果再刁难你
If he gets to ragging on you too bad,

122
00:11:27,804 --> 00:11:30,425
就问他关于帕瓦罗蒂的事情
ask him about Pavarotti.

123
00:11:30,725 --> 00:11:32,351
我们没时间讲故事
We don't have time for sea stories.

124
00:11:32,435 --> 00:11:35,521
我正在教博蒙特水兵
I was in the middle of teaching Seaman Beaumont

125
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,774
认识现代声纳系统，现在…
the intricacies of modern sonar. Now...

126
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:41,319
我不是指挥官，我是森林女王席娜
I ain't chief of the boat. I'm Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

127
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,642
- 拜托你，参谋长  - 得了吧，告诉我
- Cob, please. - Come on, Cob. Tell me.

128
00:11:44,193 --> 00:11:45,090
好吧
Okay.

129
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:46,334
好
Fine.

130
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,473
请继续
Go ahead.

131
00:11:49,261 --> 00:11:50,922
这位琼斯水兵
Seaman Jones here,

132
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:52,944
非常喜爱音乐
he's into music in a big way.

133
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:54,894
他认为整艘潜艇
He figures this whole boat is basically

134
00:11:54,968 --> 00:11:58,494
就是他个人私人录音室
just his own personal, private stereo set.

135
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:02,384
- 他正在听帕瓦罗蒂的这首…  - 是帕格尼尼
- He gets this piece of Pavarotti... - He was Paganini.

136
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:04,320
- 管他的  - 是帕格尼尼
- Whatever. - Paganini.

137
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:05,884
是我在说故事，好吗？
This is my story, okay?

138
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:06,795
那要说对
Tell it right.

139
00:12:06,886 --> 00:12:10,340
帕瓦罗蒂是男高音，帕格尼尼是作曲家
Pavarotti's a tenor. Paganini was a composer.

140
00:12:11,349 --> 00:12:14,310
反正他把这音乐对外播放
Okay. So he's got this music, and he's got it out in the water.

141
00:12:14,825 --> 00:12:18,180
然后戴上自己耳机收听，陶醉得不得了
He's listening on his headsets, happy as a clam.

142
00:12:18,606 --> 00:12:20,733
然后就天下大乱了
Then all hell breaks loose.

143
00:12:20,817 --> 00:12:24,529
- 在圣地亚哥外海的船舰…  - 还有一艘在珍珠港的船舰
- A slew of boats out of San Diego... - Including one way out at Pearl.

144
00:12:24,612 --> 00:12:27,031
还有一艘在珍珠港的船舰
Including one way out at Pearl.

145
00:12:27,115 --> 00:12:29,909
突然间，他们都听见帕瓦罗蒂的歌声
All of a sudden, they start hearing Pavarotti.

146
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,511
- 帕瓦罗蒂…  - 就这样被播放出来
- Pavarotti... - Coming out of their asses.

147
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:37,002
- 我该怎么办？  - 收到了
- What do I do? - I got it.

148
00:12:40,711 --> 00:12:43,422
主控室，097方未发现不明物
Conn, Sonar. New contact, bearing 0-9-7.

149
00:12:43,506 --> 00:12:46,551
指定代号为山脊35
Designate contact number Sierra 3-5.

150
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,146
我是舰长，侦测到什么，琼斯？
Captain, aye. What've you got, Jones?

151
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:50,470
一个很远的信号，可能是潜艇
Distant contact, probably submerged.

152
00:12:50,555 --> 00:12:51,764
只是胡乱猜测
It's a wild guess,

153
00:12:51,848 --> 00:12:54,684
不过我有不好的预感
but I'd say we hit a boomer coming out of the barn.

154
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:57,979
可能是从玻利尼亚湾来的飞弹潜艇
Could be a missile boat out of Polijarny.

155
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:01,107
好吧，继续追踪，我马上就来
Okay. Start your track. I'll be there in a minute.

156
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:02,733
是的，长官
Sonar, aye.

157
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:05,713
该打开指令了，舰长
Time to open the orders, sir.

158
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:11,427
政委正在您的舱房等你
The Political Officer is in your cabin.

159
00:14:11,886 --> 00:14:13,596
很好
Very well.

160
00:14:13,721 --> 00:14:16,390
你来指挥
You have the conn.

161
00:14:35,952 --> 00:14:37,662
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

162
00:14:37,828 --> 00:14:43,084
我在监管船员的稳定性，舰长
I must oversee the stability of the crew, Captain.

163
00:14:44,627 --> 00:14:47,964
你侵犯了我的隐私权
By invading my privacy?

164
00:14:48,756 --> 00:14:54,011
苏联并没有个人隐私，同志
Privacy is not a major concern in the Soviet Union, comrade.

165
00:14:54,262 --> 00:14:57,682
它会破坏集体利益
It's often contrary to the collective good.

166
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:06,565
“你看，我生来就是窃贼…”
"Behold, I am coming as a thief...

167
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:09,944
“人们全被带到”
"And they gathered them together

168
00:15:10,945 --> 00:15:15,324
“一个叫做…”
"In a place called...

169
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:16,993
“世界末日的战场”
"Armageddon."

170
00:15:17,618 --> 00:15:21,163
“天使将她酒杯洒向空中”
"And the seventh angel poured forth his bowl into the air,

171
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:24,166
一个来自天堂的声音说
"and a voice cried out from heaven, saying,

172
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:26,627
“都结束了”
"'It is done."'

173
00:15:28,296 --> 00:15:33,092
堂堂指挥官竟然对世界末日有兴趣
A man with your responsibilities reading about the end of the world.

174
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:34,510
这又是什么？
And what's this?

175
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,146
“我代表死神”
"I am become death,

176
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:38,891
“毁掉了全世界”
the destroyer of worlds."

177
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:43,894
这是一个美国人引述古印度圣经的话
It is an ancient Hindu text quoted by an American.

178
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,093
美国人？
American?

179
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,270
他发明了原子弹
He invented the atomic bomb,

180
00:15:47,356 --> 00:15:50,526
后来被指控为共产党员
and he was later accused of being a communist.

181
00:15:51,068 --> 00:15:54,739
你还在这些话下面划线加注解
You wrote and underlined these passages?

182
00:15:54,822 --> 00:15:56,240
不是
No.

183
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,253
这本书是我妻子的
This book belonged to my wife.

184
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,450
我把书留下来纪念她
I keep it for sentimental value.

185
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:06,792
我很遗憾，舰长同志，你的妻子很美丽
I'm sorry, Comrade Captain. Your wife was a beautiful woman.

186
00:16:06,876 --> 00:16:09,378
我为她的死感到遗憾
Her death was unfortunate.

187
00:16:10,171 --> 00:16:13,382
我只是在履行我的职责，这是我的责任
I'm only doing my job. It is my responsibility.

188
00:16:17,345 --> 00:16:20,473
苏联国家安全委员会在我的潜艇安插多少特务？
How many agents did the KGB put aboard my boat?

189
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,282
- 你的潜艇，舰长？  - 没错
- Your boat, Captain? - Yes.

190
00:16:22,725 --> 00:16:26,228
这艘舰艇是属于苏联人民的
This vessel belongs to the people of the Soviet Union.

191
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,650
另外
Besides,

192
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,029
即使他们真的派特务到船上
if the KGB or the GRU has agents aboard,

193
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:33,527
我也不会知道
I will be the last to know.

194
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,532
打开指令吧，舰长
I suggest we open our orders, Captain.

195
00:16:40,368 --> 00:16:42,536
当然，同志
Certainly, comrade.

196
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:26,414
来自指挥部…
"From Commander...

197
00:17:26,497 --> 00:17:30,501
战略潜艇红旗北方舰队
"Strategic submarine forces red banner northern fleet."

198
00:17:30,584 --> 00:17:35,840
继续向北航行到座标5490的地方
We're to proceed north to grid square reference 54-90

199
00:17:35,923 --> 00:17:39,677
与科诺瓦罗夫号潜艇会合
and rendezvous with Alfa submarine Konovalov.

200
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,220
图波列夫舰长的潜艇
Captain Tupolev's boat.

201
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:43,550
你认识他？
You know Tupolev?

202
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,284
我知道他是贵族之后
I know he descends from aristocracy...

203
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,100
他曾是你的学生
and that he was your student.

204
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:52,356
据说你在他心中占有很重要的位置
It's rumored he has a special place in his heart for you.

205
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,485
图波列夫的心中只有他自己
There's little room in Tupolev's heart for anyone but Tupolev.

206
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,882
跟他会合后
Having made contact,

207
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,700
我们会进行一系列的军演
we are to run a series of drills.

208
00:18:03,784 --> 00:18:06,787
图波列夫会趁我们测试潜艇时追击我们
Tupolev will hunt us while we test our ship.

209
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:09,757
测试过本舰的履带推进系统后
Having evaluated the operational readiness of the caterpillar drive,

210
00:18:09,813 --> 00:18:13,904
我们会在本月16日返抵玻利尼亚湾
we are to return to Polijarny on or about the 16th of this month.

211
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,054
船长
Captain,

212
00:18:17,669 --> 00:18:19,810
现在对我们来说是历史性的时刻
this is an historic moment.

213
00:18:19,893 --> 00:18:21,181
我有一个请求
I'd like to make a request.

214
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:23,550
- 在你开始之前，同志…  - 我知道这不合规矩
- Before you proceed, comrade... - I know it's not protocol,

215
00:18:23,637 --> 00:18:25,431
但是否能将我们任务
but would you permit me to post our orders

216
00:18:25,514 --> 00:18:28,350
告知全体船员
and inform the crew of our mission?

217
00:18:53,417 --> 00:18:56,921
我现在要去的地方不是你能来的
Where I'm going, you cannot follow.

218
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,344
帕契夫医官
Dr. Petrov,

219
00:19:27,724 --> 00:19:29,660
马上到舰长室报到
report to my cabin immediately.

220
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:32,706
这里发生了可怕的意外
There's been a dreadful accident.

221
00:19:39,087 --> 00:19:41,423
（船坞4号  美国海军造船厂）

222
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,467
（帕都森，马里兰州）

223
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:03,988
伙计
Buddy!

224
00:20:12,121 --> 00:20:15,708
丹尼，我需要更多的焊棒
Daniel, got any more rods? More rods!

225
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:19,003
听我说，这下面没有托架
Listen to me. There's no cradle underneath it.

226
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,221
把它反过来
Get it over.

227
00:20:20,433 --> 00:20:22,460
轻松点，别哩嗦的
Relax! Stop being an old maid.

228
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,717
不然你自己来做
You want to come up here and do it yourself?

229
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,761
- 好吧，把她弄上来  - 什么？
- All right. Bring her up. - What? What?

230
00:20:28,971 --> 00:20:30,306
莱恩！
Ryan!

231
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,558
谁让你进来的？
Who let you in here?

232
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,655
别提那个了
Skip,

233
00:20:33,887 --> 00:20:36,810
你现在改玩这些模型？
what, have they got you playing with models now?

234
00:20:37,313 --> 00:20:40,733
妈的，比尔！叫他们慢一点！
Damn it, Bill! Tell them to slow down!

235
00:20:40,816 --> 00:20:44,069
我在做了，你们能慢点吗？
I'm doing it. I'm doing it. Slow it down, will you?

236
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:45,504
这不是模型
It's not a model.

237
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:47,217
这是DSRV
The DSRV.

238
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:48,650
救援潜艇
escue sub.

239
00:20:48,782 --> 00:20:51,910
我知道，只是以前从来没见过，你准备怎么做？
I know what it is. What are you doing with it?

240
00:20:51,994 --> 00:20:54,496
我们打算改装它
We're rigging it with a generic docking collar

241
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:57,833
以便配合英、德及其他潜艇
so it'll mate with British, German... Just about anybody's sub.

242
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:01,128
这玩意能够在24小时内到达世界各地
We can get it anywhere in the world in 24 hours.

243
00:21:03,172 --> 00:21:05,341
- 你的背好了吗？  - 还好
- How's your back? - It's fine.

244
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,802
你有空吗？
Have you got a minute?

245
00:21:11,013 --> 00:21:13,307
比一般潜艇大
Bigger than a regular Typhoon.

246
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,506
这些门是做什么的？
What are these doors?

247
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:17,592
你也注意到了
You don't miss much, do you?

248
00:21:18,228 --> 00:21:21,065
看起来比鱼雷管大
Those are too big to be torpedo tubes.

249
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,152
能用来发射洲际弹道飞弹吗？
Would you launch an ICBM horizontally?

250
00:21:25,235 --> 00:21:28,989
当然，但为何要那样做？它们是对称的
Sure. Why would you want to? They're symmetrical.

251
00:21:30,574 --> 00:21:33,577
就在艇轴线正下方
Right down the long axis of the sub.

252
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,357
会不会是声纳探测器？
How about a towed sonar array?

253
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,711
不可能，离螺旋桨太近了
Nope. Too close to the screws.

254
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:40,000
我将要…
I'll be...

255
00:21:42,169 --> 00:21:44,713
这可能是履带装置
This... This could be a caterpillar.

256
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:47,675
- 什么？  - 一种履带推进器
- A what? - A caterpillar drive.

257
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:50,427
磁流体推进系统
Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

258
00:21:50,511 --> 00:21:52,513
- 听得懂吗？  - 不懂
- You follow? - No.

259
00:21:53,263 --> 00:21:56,475
就像水中喷射引擎
It's like a jet engine for the water.

260
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:58,769
海水从潜艇的前方进入，从后方喷出
Goes in the front, gets squirted out the back.

261
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:01,760
由于没有零件，所以非常地安静
Only it's got no moving parts, so it's very, very quiet.

262
00:22:02,731 --> 00:22:04,400
能有多安静？
Like how quiet?

263
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:07,194
安静到我们声纳系统无法探测到
It's doubtful our sonar would even pick it up.

264
00:22:07,277 --> 00:22:08,487
就算侦测到
And if it did,

265
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,282
也会以为是鲸鱼或其他生物的声音
it would sound like whales humping or a seismic anomaly.

266
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,410
不会知道那是潜艇
Anything but a submarine.

267
00:22:14,952 --> 00:22:17,371
我们几年前也研究过
We messed with this a couple of years ago.

268
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:19,790
但都没有成功
Couldn't make it work.

269
00:22:20,874 --> 00:22:24,378
这真的是潜艇吗？会不会只是模型？
They really built this? This isn't a mock-up or anything?

270
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:26,880
它今早出海了
She put to sea this morning.

271
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,346
12岁时
When I was 12,

272
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:36,849
我曾帮我父亲把地下室改造成防空洞
I helped my daddy build a bomb shelter in our basement

273
00:22:36,932 --> 00:22:39,226
只因有人将十几枚炸弹
because some fool parked a dozen warheads

274
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:42,479
瞄准佛罗里达州沿岸
90 miles off the coast of Florida.

275
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:46,024
这家伙能对华盛顿及纽约
This thing could park a couple of hundred warheads

276
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:47,609
发射上百枚飞弹
off Washington and New York,

277
00:22:47,735 --> 00:22:51,572
而且是神不知鬼不觉
and no one would know anything about it until it was all over.

278
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,046
你没事吧，舰长？
Are you all right, Captain?

279
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:06,400
没事
Yes.

280
00:23:06,795 --> 00:23:11,592
只是有点震惊他竟然被茶水绊倒而猝死
It's just to die for something as petty as slipping on tea.

281
00:23:11,675 --> 00:23:14,511
舰长，不要责怪自己，那只是个意外
You're blaming yourself, Captain. It was an accident.

282
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,239
- 我们到那时你会感觉好些的  - 到哪？
- You'll feel better when we put in. - Put in?

283
00:23:17,598 --> 00:23:19,308
回到基地，舰长
To base, Captain.

284
00:23:19,933 --> 00:23:22,060
我们不能没有政委
We cannot go on without a political officer.

285
00:23:22,144 --> 00:23:25,230
医官，这是一艘苏联战舰
Doctor, this is a combat vessel of the Soviet Navy,

286
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,649
而我是最高指战军官
and I'm a senior combat officer.

287
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:31,653
我们不能因为意外就取消行动
We do not cancel operations because of accidents.

288
00:23:33,113 --> 00:23:35,491
水兵，到这来
Seaman, come here.

289
00:23:37,326 --> 00:23:38,952
过来
Come here.

290
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:40,880
你的名字？
Your name?

291
00:23:41,493 --> 00:23:43,330
我是二厨罗金诺夫，长官
Cook's Assistant Loginov, sir.

292
00:23:43,355 --> 00:23:44,171
很好
Good.

293
00:23:44,378 --> 00:23:46,717
我要你和医官共同见证
I want you and the doctor to witness this.

294
00:23:48,295 --> 00:23:51,757
我拿下了政委的密钥…
I'm removing the political officer's missile key...

295
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,913
抬走吧
Carry on.

296
00:23:53,622 --> 00:23:55,501
交由我自己保管
And I'm keeping it myself.

297
00:23:56,178 --> 00:23:59,097
舰长，我们应该将此事呈报红色舰队指挥部
Captain, I think we should report this to Red Fleet Command.

298
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,494
不行，医官
I'm afraid that's impossible, Doctor.

299
00:24:00,593 --> 00:24:03,140
上级指示不得使用无线电
Our orders are for strict radio silence.

300
00:24:03,227 --> 00:24:05,062
指令，长官
Orders, sir.

301
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:07,105
- 你可以离开了，罗金诺夫  - 是，长官
- That's all, Loginov. - Yes, sir.

302
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:10,150
舰长，这样做并不合规定
This is most unnerving, Captain.

303
00:24:10,818 --> 00:24:13,904
之所以会有两把密钥
The reason for having two missile keys

304
00:24:13,987 --> 00:24:18,492
是以防任何人可以随意…
is so that no one man may...

305
00:24:18,575 --> 00:24:20,327
随意什么？
May what?

306
00:24:21,537 --> 00:24:24,915
随意发射飞弹，或许钥匙应该由我来保管
May arm the missiles. Perhaps I should keep the key.

307
00:24:24,998 --> 00:24:27,751
- 谢谢你，医官  - 舰长
- Thank you. That'll be all, Doctor. - Captain, I...

308
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,302
等我向全体船员讲话时
When I address the crew,

309
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:31,880
你就会明白了
then you will understand.

310
00:24:32,923 --> 00:24:34,591
是，长官
Yes, sir.

311
00:24:37,052 --> 00:24:39,054
- 帕契夫  - 什么事，长官？
- Petrov. - Yes, sir?

312
00:24:39,596 --> 00:24:44,518
我回报上级时不会提及有关你的评论
I will try to forget your comments when I present my report.

313
00:24:44,601 --> 00:24:46,728
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

314
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:55,320
目前停在310航道
Holding steady on 3-1-0.

315
00:24:55,404 --> 00:24:57,990
航速12节，大约2万码外
Twelve knots at about 20,000 yards.

316
00:24:58,070 --> 00:24:59,002
有它的资料吗？
Have you got a make on him?

317
00:24:59,073 --> 00:25:00,861
电脑正在分析，长官
Computer's chewing on it, sir.

318
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,629
双螺旋桨
Twin screws.

319
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:05,098
听起来像台风级潜艇
The plant noise sounds like a Typhoon.

320
00:25:10,585 --> 00:25:14,714
（苏联台风级潜艇  没有任何过往记录）

321
00:25:15,132 --> 00:25:16,925
长官，好像是新型潜艇
I'd say we got a new boat, sir.

322
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:19,678
汤米，之前有收到它的资料吗？
Tommy, I miss something on the boards?

323
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:22,556
目前没有任何纪录
Sub plant hasn't said anything about it.

324
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:26,852
好吧
All right.

325
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:28,520
电脑里有几艘台风级潜艇？
How many Typhoons we got in the computer?

326
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,622
六艘，长官
Six, sir.

327
00:25:29,854 --> 00:25:30,734
好
Okay.

328
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:32,560
将它命名为台风七号
Call this guy Typhoon 7.

329
00:25:32,649 --> 00:25:35,360
开始追踪录音，看是否能查到详细资料
Start a tape on him. See if we can work in a little closer.

330
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:37,154
是，长官
Yes, sir.

331
00:25:37,905 --> 00:25:39,364
他们不会发觉吗？
Won't he hear us?

332
00:25:39,448 --> 00:25:41,783
顺着它的航道就不会，博蒙特水兵
Not if we stay in his baffles, Seaman Beaumont.

333
00:25:41,909 --> 00:25:44,536
跟在它的螺旋桨后
Not if we stay in his baffles.

334
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:47,956
从后方进入，他就不会听到任何声音
Come in behind his propeller, and he's deaf as a post.

335
00:26:17,027 --> 00:26:19,905
卡马洛夫，声纳有发现异样吗？
Any sonar contacts, Mr. Kamarov?

336
00:26:19,988 --> 00:26:22,407
没有异样，舰长
No contacts, Captain. The sonar is clear.

337
00:26:22,491 --> 00:26:25,869
好，水面上有什么动静吗？伯罗丁先生
Good. Do we have any surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?

338
00:26:25,953 --> 00:26:28,288
- 没有任何发现，长官  - 很好
- No contacts, sir. Scope is clear. - Good.

339
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:31,708
现在是向全体船员宣布上级命令的时候了
Then it is time I explain our orders to the crew.

340
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:36,546
同志们，我是你们的舰长
Comrades, this is your captain.

341
00:26:37,297 --> 00:26:39,383
很荣幸能够和你们讲话
It is an honor to speak to you today,

342
00:26:39,466 --> 00:26:42,427
也很荣幸能够和你们一起经历
and I'm honored to be sailing with you on the maiden voyage

343
00:26:42,511 --> 00:26:45,597
我们祖国研究的最新式潜艇的处女航
of our motherland's most recent achievement.

344
00:26:45,681 --> 00:26:50,435
我们又再一次，进入了这个生死攸关的危险游戏
And once more, we play our dangerous game,

345
00:26:50,519 --> 00:26:52,270
对手就是
a game of chess,

346
00:26:52,354 --> 00:26:56,358
我的的宿敌，美国海军
against our old adversary, the American Navy.

347
00:26:57,317 --> 00:26:58,777
40年来
For 40 years,

348
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,446
你们的父兄
your fathers before you and your older brothers

349
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,907
已经和它们交战过数十回
played this game and played it well.

350
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:06,767
然而如今情势已不同
But today, the game is different.

351
00:27:07,018 --> 00:27:08,910
我方略占上风
We have the advantage.

352
00:27:08,996 --> 00:27:13,583
这让我想起过去那个辉煌的时期
It reminds me of the heady days of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin,

353
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:16,920
过去人们曾因我们的火箭巨响而震惊
when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets.

354
00:27:17,004 --> 00:27:20,966
今日它们将再度因我们的无声而诧异
They will tremble again at the sound of our silence.

355
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,901
启动无声推进系统
The order is engage for silent drive.

356
00:27:24,155 --> 00:27:25,203
是，长官
Aye, sir.

357
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:27,575
控制室，打开外舱门
Ballast control, open outer doors.

358
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,140
收到，打开外舱门
Yes, open outer doors.

359
00:27:29,224 --> 00:27:30,434
潜水命令
Diving command.

360
00:27:30,517 --> 00:27:33,603
接合履带推进器，关闭主引擎
Engage caterpillar and secure main engines.

361
00:27:37,858 --> 00:27:39,276
外舱门已打开，舰长
Doors opening, Captain.

362
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,442
同志们
Comrades,

363
00:27:40,673 --> 00:27:43,460
我们的舰队仍不了解我们潜艇的性能
our own fleet doesn't know our full potential.

364
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:46,575
他们会尽全力追捕我们
They will do everything possible to test us,

365
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,661
但那只会让他们自惭形秽
but they will only test their own embarrassment.

366
00:27:49,745 --> 00:27:51,997
我们将躲过追捕
We will leave our fleet behind.

367
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,458
穿越美军舰队的巡查
We will pass through the American patrols,

368
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,501
越过他们的声纳系统
pass their sonar nets,

369
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,888
当我们进行飞弹进攻时
and lay off their largest city...

370
00:27:59,071 --> 00:28:01,906
将一边听他们的摇滚乐
and listen to their rock 'n' roll

371
00:28:02,215 --> 00:28:05,177
边摧毁它们最大的城市
while we conduct missile drills.

372
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:07,095
然后…
Then...

373
00:28:07,637 --> 00:28:09,598
在这些结束之后
And when we are finished,

374
00:28:09,723 --> 00:28:13,018
他们唯一能听到的就是我们的欢呼声
the only sound they will hear is our laughter

375
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:14,853
当我们抵达哈瓦那时
while we sail to Havana,

376
00:28:14,936 --> 00:28:18,440
迎接我们的将是同志般温暖的阳光
where the sun is warm and so is the comradeship.

377
00:28:20,442 --> 00:28:22,360
降温装置准备已就绪，舰长
Cryogenic plant coming on line, Captain.

378
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,497
今天是伟大的一天，同志们
A great day, comrades.

379
00:28:25,222 --> 00:28:27,110
我们正在改写历史
We sail into history.

380
00:28:33,622 --> 00:28:35,957
履带接合就绪
Caterpillar engaging.

381
00:28:38,168 --> 00:28:41,588
履带接合已就绪，舰长
Caterpillar engaging, Captain.

382
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,368
- 什么情况？  - 我不知道
- What happened? - I don't know.

383
00:29:24,673 --> 00:29:27,425
- 左满舵  - 左满舵
- Full rudder left. - Full rudder left.

384
00:29:27,509 --> 00:29:30,929
引航员，新航线250
Navigator. New course, 2-5-0.

385
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:34,266
- 新航线250  - 转向250
- Yes, new course, 2-5-0. - Steering 2-5-0.

386
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:36,977
新航线250
Yes, course is 2-5-0.

387
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,853
有声纳信号，舰长
Sonar contact, Captain.

388
00:30:09,037 --> 00:30:11,145
在左后方，离我们很近
Port quarter. Close aboard.

389
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:14,347
是美国洛杉矶级潜艇
American, Los Angeles class.

390
00:30:15,015 --> 00:30:19,269
- 是美国人，舰长…  - 在航线310
- American. Captain, we... - Course 3-1-0.

391
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:22,662
美军有没有跟来？
Is the American turning to follow us?

392
00:30:23,002 --> 00:30:24,116
没有，舰长
No, Captain.

393
00:30:25,025 --> 00:30:27,402
美军仍按原定航线行驶
The American is continuing in his original course.

394
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,029
继续向西北方向行进
He's continuing northwest.

395
00:30:29,192 --> 00:30:30,745
他们听不到我们
He can't hear us.

396
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:33,575
那这些歌声呢？
And the singing?

397
00:30:47,297 --> 00:30:49,549
让他们唱吧
Let them sing.

398
00:31:08,568 --> 00:31:10,028
你说什么？检查你的传动装置
What are you talking about? Check your gear.

399
00:31:10,111 --> 00:31:12,614
诊断器正在运作，舰长
Running diagnostics now, Captain.

400
00:31:19,621 --> 00:31:22,874
声纳一切正常，俄国人都消失了
Sonar is working, Captain. The Russian disappeared.

401
00:31:22,958 --> 00:31:25,961
一分钟前，他还在4000码外
One minute, he was steady 4,000 yards off the bow,

402
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,476
现在居然凭空消失
and then he was gone,

403
00:31:28,293 --> 00:31:30,420
我刚刚好像听到了…
and for a second, I thought I heard...

404
00:31:31,630 --> 00:31:32,756
听到什么？
Heard what?

405
00:31:33,702 --> 00:31:35,824
听到了歌声，长官
I thought I heard singing, sir.

406
00:31:37,681 --> 00:31:40,100
- 歌声？  - 是的，长官
- Singing? - Yes, sir.

407
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:48,608
（红色舰队政治指挥中心  莫斯科）

408
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,804
早安，长官
Good morning, sir.

409
00:32:10,207 --> 00:32:12,571
希望你昨晚玩得很开心
I hope we had a lovely evening.

410
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:15,552
今天早晨有点冷
A little chilly this morning.

411
00:32:39,242 --> 00:32:43,330
这有一封马可・雷米思寄来的信
There's a letter there from Marko Ramius.

412
00:32:44,497 --> 00:32:46,833
马可
Marko.

413
00:33:17,739 --> 00:33:18,865
喂
Yes?

414
00:33:19,908 --> 00:33:22,619
不，我是莱恩博士
No. This is Dr. Ryan.

415
00:33:26,081 --> 00:33:27,248
怎么回事？
What the hell happened?

416
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:27,962
跟我来
Come on.

417
00:33:28,053 --> 00:33:30,122
这已不再是一个搜索任务了
This is no longer a research project.

418
00:33:34,923 --> 00:33:37,300
我在门上发现了一条线
I got a line on those doors.

419
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:41,888
你知道那是什么吗？
You know what they are?

420
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,597
无声推进系统？
A nearly silent propulsion system?

421
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,850
你怎么知道的？
How did you know that?

422
00:33:47,936 --> 00:33:50,814
我方潜艇追踪到它的信号
The captain of the sub following her radioed in.

423
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,963
之后却凭空消失
Thing disappeared right in front of him,

424
00:33:53,854 --> 00:33:55,690
还不只这样
and that's only the half of it.

425
00:33:55,777 --> 00:33:57,487
看看这个吧
Read.

426
00:34:04,119 --> 00:34:06,162
对不起
I'm sorry.

427
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,138
有带证件吗？
Got your I.D.?

428
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,942
天啊！真令人无法相信
My God, this is unbelievable.

429
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,222
基洛夫号
The Kirov,

430
00:34:11,484 --> 00:34:13,727
三艘斯德洛夫、基辅
three Sverdlovsk, the Kiev,

431
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,040
明斯克
the Minsk.

432
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,006
他们出动了所有的舰队
They've sortied their whole bloody fleet.

433
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,299
看来是这样
That's about the size of it.

434
00:34:18,425 --> 00:34:21,469
（潜艇四级，白宫安全局）
- 下午好，司令  - 下午好，马修
- Good afternoon, Admiral. - Afternoon, Matthew.

435
00:34:21,928 --> 00:34:23,263
我们要去哪？
Where are we going, anyway?

436
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,231
向杰弗瑞・派特做简报
Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt,

437
00:34:25,617 --> 00:34:27,800
白宫安全局顾问
President's National Security Adviser.

438
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,989
大多数参谋总长都会列席
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there,

439
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,135
及其他相关人士
along with a few other people.

440
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,533
谁要来做简报？
Who's giving the briefing?

441
00:34:35,443 --> 00:34:36,600
你
You are.

442
00:34:36,693 --> 00:34:39,112
文书官会帮你放映幻灯片
The yeoman will have all the slides laid out for you.

443
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:41,656
你只要上台就好
So all you got to do...

444
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,094
听着
Look,

445
00:34:48,806 --> 00:34:52,006
没有人能比你更了解这份资料
no one understands this material better than you.

446
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,442
把你所知道有关潜艇的一切都告诉他
Just give him a rundown on the sub and a précis of the stuff in your hand.

447
00:34:56,963 --> 00:34:59,424
他可能会问你一些问题
He's liable to ask some direct questions.

448
00:34:59,507 --> 00:35:02,802
你就直言不讳，不必顾忌
Give him direct answers. Tell him what you think.

449
00:35:03,678 --> 00:35:05,305
来吧
Come on.

450
00:35:11,186 --> 00:35:14,063
各位，在过去的24小时我们看到
Gentlemen, the last 24 hours have seen

451
00:35:14,147 --> 00:35:17,984
苏联海军有一些不寻常的举动
some extraordinary Soviet Naval activity.

452
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:20,033
首先是这艘船
The first to sail was this ship,

453
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:22,010
叫做“红色十月号”
we believe called the Red October

454
00:35:22,071 --> 00:35:25,783
其名取自1917年的十月革命
in reference to the October Revolution of 1917.

455
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,545
是新型台风级潜艇
A variant of the Typhoon class,

456
00:35:27,603 --> 00:35:29,660
船身长650英尺
she's some 650 feet long

457
00:35:29,871 --> 00:35:32,373
有三万两千吨的排水量
and 32,000 tons submerged displacement,

458
00:35:32,499 --> 00:35:36,794
大小可媲美二战时的航空母舰
roughly the same size as a World War II aircraft carrier.

459
00:35:36,878 --> 00:35:41,132
我们认为船头和船尾的门内
We believe that these doors, here on the bow and again on the stern,

460
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:43,635
隐藏着一个特殊的传动系统
enclose a unique propulsion system,

461
00:35:43,718 --> 00:35:47,180
磁力水流推进系统，或是履带式
a magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar,

462
00:35:47,263 --> 00:35:50,725
它能够使潜艇几乎无声的行进
that would enable the sub to run virtually silent.

463
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:53,144
这种新型传动系统
It is possible that this new drive system

464
00:35:53,228 --> 00:35:55,230
让舰长，他叫雷米思
allowed the captain, a man named Ramius,

465
00:35:55,355 --> 00:35:57,357
苏联最资深的潜艇指挥官
their senior and perhaps most respected commander...

466
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,359
有他的照片吗？
Do we have his picture available?

467
00:35:59,442 --> 00:36:02,987
让雷米思逃过我们的达拉斯号的追踪
Allowed Ramius to elude one of our attack boats, the Dallas,

468
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:06,407
它今天早晨从港口开始追踪红色十月
which trailed Red October from harbor this morning.

469
00:36:08,451 --> 00:36:12,121
而一旦启用了这套推进系统
It is also possible that this drive system, if operable,

470
00:36:13,081 --> 00:36:14,249
红色十月号
could render the Red October

471
00:36:14,374 --> 00:36:17,919
我们在大西洋的声纳监视系统根本无法监测到它
undetectable to our SOSUS warning nets in the Atlantic.

472
00:36:18,044 --> 00:36:22,048
莱恩先生，你认为它是第一线攻击武器吗？
Mr. Ryan, would you characterize this as a first-strike weapon?

473
00:36:25,927 --> 00:36:28,221
有可能，长官
That is a possibility, sir.

474
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:30,723
此舰的设计
It is designed to approach by stealth

475
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:33,351
就是针对目标
and to shower its target with multiple independent warheads

476
00:36:33,434 --> 00:36:36,771
毫无预警的发射飞弹
with little or no warning before impact.

477
00:36:36,896 --> 00:36:40,108
这东西根本就是为开战而设计的
Goddamn thing's made to start a war.

478
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,080
继续，莱恩先生
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

479
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,709
达拉斯号跟丢了之后
About the same time the Dallas lost contact,

480
00:36:44,759 --> 00:36:47,250
陆续有潜艇出港，从玻利尼亚湾…
there were additional sailings from Polijarny...

481
00:36:48,237 --> 00:36:51,388
从波罗的海的列宁格勒，以及从地中海
and from Leningrad on the Baltic and from the Mediterranean.

482
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,455
目前约有58艘潜艇
There are now some 58 nuclear submarines

483
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,808
朝着大西洋全速前进
headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

484
00:36:57,292 --> 00:37:00,878
今天下午在玻利尼亚湾上空的卫星侦测到
This afternoon a satellite pass over Polijarny found heat blooms

485
00:37:00,962 --> 00:37:03,381
在明斯克有异常的舰队行动
in the engineering plants of the Kirov, the Minsk,

486
00:37:03,464 --> 00:37:05,508
另外有20多艘巡洋舰及驱逐舰
and more than 20 other cruisers and destroyers,

487
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:07,885
目前正待命出港
indicating they were preparing to sail.

488
00:37:07,969 --> 00:37:11,389
这是苏联有史以来最大的阵容
This constitutes the bulk of the Soviet surface fleet.

489
00:37:11,472 --> 00:37:13,891
格里尔将军，你来作总结
Admiral Greer, your conclusions.

490
00:37:13,970 --> 00:37:17,048
长官，这些数据并不能得出什么结论
Sir, the data support no conclusions as yet.

491
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,854
在太平洋没有侦测到活动
The absence of activity in the Pacific...

492
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:21,622
证明这可能只是一次…
suggests this could be just an...

493
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,150
演习
exercise.

494
00:37:24,152 --> 00:37:26,821
- 这可能跟战事无关  - 假如不是演习呢？
- It may have nothing to do... - Suppose it's not an exercise?

495
00:37:26,946 --> 00:37:29,699
假如这是和北约对抗的开端呢？
Suppose this is the beginning of a move against NATO?

496
00:37:29,782 --> 00:37:32,160
这应该由国安局来回答，佩尔特先生
NSA can speak for that, Mr. Pelt.

497
00:37:32,285 --> 00:37:35,246
我必须再次强调这事的高度机密性
I must emphasize the extreme sensitivity of this information

498
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,998
绝不能外泄
and that it not leave the room.

499
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:38,006
起航前
Before sailing,

500
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:41,093
雷米思舰长寄给尤里・帕多林将军一封信
Captain Ramius sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin,

501
00:37:41,669 --> 00:37:45,298
他是北方政治指挥中心红色舰队主席
Chairman of the Red Fleet Northern Political Directorate.

502
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:48,100
- 那是她的叔叔  - 谁的叔叔？
- That's her uncle. - Whose uncle?

503
00:37:48,343 --> 00:37:51,679
雷米斯的妻子，帕多林是她的叔叔
Ramius' wife. Padorin's her uncle.

504
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:55,975
目前无从得知信的内容
Now, the contents of the letter are unknown,

505
00:37:56,059 --> 00:37:58,478
但是帕多林将军立刻召见了
but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded

506
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,648
契尔年科总理
a meeting with Premier Chernenko,

507
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,236
会见持续了几分钟
and within minutes of that meeting,

508
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:06,742
之后苏联舰队即奉命出动追捕红色十月号
the Soviet fleet sailed with orders to find Red October...

509
00:38:07,189 --> 00:38:08,400
并将之击沉
and sink her.

510
00:38:10,573 --> 00:38:11,616
击沉它？
Sink her?

511
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:14,285
天啊，当中有多少核子潜舰
My God. They've got a madman on their hands.

512
00:38:14,369 --> 00:38:16,454
如果它到达500哩外海内
If it gets within 500 miles of the coast,

513
00:38:16,537 --> 00:38:20,500
我们只有两分钟的应变时间
we'll have less than two minutes' warning.

514
00:38:35,056 --> 00:38:37,016
- 今天是23号吧？  - 什么？
- Today's the 23rd, isn't it? - What?

515
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,560
- 今天是不是23号？  - 是啊
- Is today the 23rd? - Yeah.

516
00:38:50,405 --> 00:38:53,241
你这混蛋
You son of a bitch.

517
00:38:54,033 --> 00:38:56,703
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

518
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:03,068
你有什么要补充的吗，莱恩博士？
You wish to add something to our discussion, Dr. Ryan?

519
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:10,216
长官，我只是在想
Sir, I was just thinking

520
00:39:10,299 --> 00:39:14,387
也许我们要考虑另外一种可能性
that perhaps there's another possibility we might consider.

521
00:39:15,805 --> 00:39:18,015
雷米思可能是要叛变
Ramius might be trying to defect.

522
00:39:18,099 --> 00:39:19,851
你在暗示这个人…
Do you mean to suggest that this man has come...

523
00:39:19,934 --> 00:39:22,145
莱恩先生，请继续
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

524
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:30,348
雷米思训练出大部分的军官干部
Ramius trained most of their officer corps,

525
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:33,931
这让他处于优势，选择自己信任的幕僚
which would put him in a position to select men willing to help him.

526
00:39:35,116 --> 00:39:37,702
他不是俄国人
And he's not Russian.

527
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,330
他出生于立陶宛，由他当渔夫的祖父养大
He's Lithuanian by birth, raised by his paternal grandfather, a fisherman.

528
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:46,461
他也没有子女，无后顾之忧
And he has no children, no ties to leave behind.

529
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:53,384
今天还是他妻子逝世一周年的纪念日
And today is the first anniversary of his wife's death.

530
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,568
得了吧
Come on. 

531
00:39:54,762 --> 00:39:57,570
你只是个分析师，难道真能看穿他的心思？
You're just an analyst. How can you read his mind?

532
00:39:57,638 --> 00:39:59,766
我了解雷米思，将军
I know Ramius, General.

533
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,352
他是潜艇界的传奇人物
He's nearly a legend in the submarine community.

534
00:40:03,436 --> 00:40:04,896
他也不是个乖乖牌
He's been a maverick his entire career.

535
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:07,356
我曾在使馆晚宴上见过他一次
I actually met him once at an embassy dinner.

536
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,152
你见过雷米思舰长吗，将军？
Have you ever met Captain Ramius, General?

537
00:40:18,826 --> 00:40:20,328
霍利斯将军…
Admiral Hollis,

538
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:25,322
距离雷米思到达能向我们发射导弹的位置还有多久？
how long before Ramius could be in a position to fire his missiles at us?

539
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,300
四天
Four days.

540
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,683
好，我会向总统作简报
All right. I'll brief the President.

541
00:40:29,766 --> 00:40:31,355
会议到此结束，先生们
That will be all, gentlemen.

542
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,244
莱恩博士
Dr. Ryan,

543
00:40:33,479 --> 00:40:36,170
能否请你留下来一下？
would you stay for a moment, please?

544
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:40,348
我只是要你说出自己的想法，但是老天…
I said speak your mind, Jack, but Jesus...

545
00:40:53,069 --> 00:40:56,280
杰克，你刚刚让将军很没面子
You slammed the door on the general pretty hard, Jack.

546
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,848
我不是有意的，长官
That was not my intention, sir.

547
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,567
你当然是有意的
Yes, it was.

548
00:40:59,992 --> 00:41:02,662
他故意讽刺你，所以你要教训他
He was patronizing you, and you stomped on him.

549
00:41:02,745 --> 00:41:05,248
在我看来是他活该
In my opinion, he deserved it.

550
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,684
听着
Listen,

551
00:41:08,185 --> 00:41:10,870
我是一名政客，这意味着我擅于说谎伪装
I'm a politician, which means I'm a cheat and a liar,

552
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,571
为了达到目的
and when I'm not kissing babies,

553
00:41:12,737 --> 00:41:14,375
我可以不择手段
I'm stealing their lollipops,

554
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,494
但这也意味着…
but it also means...

555
00:41:16,836 --> 00:41:18,510
我会听取各方意见
that I keep my options open.

556
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,200
那么…
So...

557
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,720
假设你刚才的看法是对的
let's assume for a minute that you're right...

558
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:28,944
这个俄国人的确想要叛变
and this Russian intends to defect.

559
00:41:30,523 --> 00:41:33,192
你认为我们该怎么办？
What do you suggest we do about it?

560
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,640
当然是接管潜艇，长官
We definitely grab the boat, sir.

561
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:38,530
等一下
Wait a minute.

562
00:41:38,614 --> 00:41:41,784
我们说的可不是投诚的米格机
We're not talking about some stray pilot with a MIG.

563
00:41:41,868 --> 00:41:42,827
我们是在讨论
We're talking about...

564
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,205
价值几十亿美元苏联的财产
several billion dollars' worth of Soviet state property.

565
00:41:46,747 --> 00:41:48,666
他们肯定想要夺回来
They're going to want it back.

566
00:41:48,749 --> 00:41:49,876
也许到时候
Maybe it's enough then

567
00:41:49,950 --> 00:41:52,042
派几个人登舰检查
just to get some people onboard and inspect it.

568
00:41:52,290 --> 00:41:53,733
可以随便想个名目
Call it whatever you want to...

569
00:41:53,796 --> 00:41:56,160
例如海岸警卫队的安全检查
A coast guard safety inspection.

570
00:41:56,591 --> 00:41:59,260
那要怎么进行？
So how do we proceed?

571
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,501
首先，我们应该通知大西洋司令部
First, we need to contact the commanders in the Atlantic directly.

572
00:42:03,766 --> 00:42:06,858
如果让苏联方面听到风声
The Russians get one whiff of this through the regular communications circuits,

573
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,362
这戏就没得唱了
the game is up.

574
00:42:08,728 --> 00:42:11,647
其次，我们必须搞清楚如何帮他们
Second, we figure out how we can help them.

575
00:42:11,868 --> 00:42:14,011
想法介入其中
We devise a plan to intercede,

576
00:42:14,248 --> 00:42:16,116
必须是能立刻执行的计划
ready to go at a moment's notice.

577
00:42:16,444 --> 00:42:20,406
最后，想办法和雷米思取得联系
Third, somebody's got to go make contact with Ramius

578
00:42:20,489 --> 00:42:22,950
查看他真正的意图
and find out what his intentions really are.

579
00:42:23,075 --> 00:42:25,244
好，你何时出发？
Okay. When do you leave?

580
00:42:26,913 --> 00:42:28,414
等等
Wait a minute.

581
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:32,418
将军说的对
The general was right.

582
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:34,629
我不是这方面专家，我只是个分析师
I am not field personnel. I am only an analyst.

583
00:42:34,754 --> 00:42:35,880
你是最好的人选
You're perfect.

584
00:42:35,963 --> 00:42:37,924
我没其他人可以用
I can't ask any of these characters to go.

585
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:39,467
没人相信这个说法
They don't believe in it.

586
00:42:39,592 --> 00:42:42,553
他们也不会拿自己前途开玩笑，但你…
They'd never stake their reputation on a hunch, whereas you...

587
00:42:42,637 --> 00:42:44,639
可以被牺牲
Are expendable.

588
00:42:47,308 --> 00:42:49,477
差不多
Something like that.

589
00:42:52,772 --> 00:42:56,233
我给你三天的时间来证明你的理论
I'll give you three days to prove your theory correct.

590
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,300
在那之后
After that,

591
00:42:58,182 --> 00:43:00,618
我必须要追捕雷米思并杀死他
I have to hunt down Ramius and destroy him.

592
00:43:01,155 --> 00:43:02,782
你同意吗？
Will you do it?

593
00:43:05,868 --> 00:43:06,618
（座标5490）

594
00:43:06,785 --> 00:43:10,664
（苏联阿法级潜艇科诺瓦罗夫号）

595
00:43:10,831 --> 00:43:13,625
（图波列夫船长指挥）

596
00:43:19,799 --> 00:43:22,927
我的天！收起桅杆！
Mother of God! Secure the mast!

597
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,429
三分之二全速前进！下潜至900米！
All ahead, two-thirds! Set depth to 900 meters!

598
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:27,153
怎么了？发生什么事？
What is it? What's happened?

599
00:43:27,413 --> 00:43:29,300
桅杆收起，加速前进
Mast secured, helm at two-thirds.

600
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:34,235
朝航道205前进
Commence heading 2-0-5.

601
00:43:34,442 --> 00:43:36,640
朝航道205前进
2-0-5, affirmative.

602
00:43:49,996 --> 00:43:53,416
这些命令是七小时前发出的
These orders are seven bloody hours old!

603
00:43:53,499 --> 00:43:56,669
被压在一堆文件的下面
Sitting on the bottom like an addled schoolboy.

604
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:58,045
- 舰长  - 我们正经过…
- Captain... - Passing at...

605
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,297
- 侧翼，全速前进  - 侧翼，全速前进
- All ahead, flank. - All ahead, flank.

606
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:01,924
问问轮机室
Inquire of the engineer about the possibility

607
00:44:02,008 --> 00:44:04,927
航速可否加快到105
of going to 105% on the reactor.

608
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,835
七个小时
Seven hours.

609
00:44:08,555 --> 00:44:10,723
整个舰队都在追捕他
The entire fleet is after him.

610
00:44:19,692 --> 00:44:22,278
- 深度900米  - 很好
- Leveling at 900 meters. - Very well.

611
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,142
船长
Captain,

612
00:44:23,437 --> 00:44:26,546
机械师说航速可以加到105
engineer reports 105% on the reactor possible,

613
00:44:27,074 --> 00:44:29,243
但并不建议那样做
but not recommended.

614
00:44:39,795 --> 00:44:42,089
加速至105
Go to 105 on the reactor.

615
00:44:45,217 --> 00:44:48,345
舰长，发生了什么事？我们要去哪？
Captain, what is it? Where are we going?

616
00:44:48,429 --> 00:44:51,390
我们要去消灭一个朋友，叶甫根尼
We're going to kill a friend, Yevgeni.

617
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:54,393
我们要去灭掉雷米思
We're going to kill Ramius.

618
00:45:15,990 --> 00:45:17,512
如果你喜欢罗宋汤
If you like borscht, perhaps,

619
00:45:17,611 --> 00:45:20,215
我在一艘邮轮上尝过更棒的
but I've eaten better in an oiler's galley.

620
00:45:20,461 --> 00:45:22,004
我妻子对侍者说
My wife said to the waiter,

621
00:45:22,088 --> 00:45:25,883
“他是从哪学的烹饪，是阿富汗吗？”
"Where did this man learn to cook, Afghanistan?"

622
00:45:25,966 --> 00:45:28,844
然后我们去了大剧院，欣赏芭蕾舞
So then we went on to the Bolshoi, the ballet,

623
00:45:28,928 --> 00:45:32,389
去看那名新来的女舞者，她真的很漂亮
to see this new girl as Giselle. You remember how beautiful she was.

624
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:34,734
听说嫁给了一位厂长…
She just married a factory manager.

625
00:45:34,786 --> 00:45:36,100
恕我打断一下，医官
Excuse me, Doctor.

626
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:41,982
你有最新的辐射测试数据吗？
Do you have the figures for the latest batch of radiation tests?

627
00:45:42,108 --> 00:45:44,777
- 现在就要吗？  - 现在就要
- Now? - Now.

628
00:45:47,488 --> 00:45:51,408
若有上次的数据那更好
Perhaps you could bring the preceding set as well

629
00:45:51,492 --> 00:45:53,452
可以做比较
for comparison.

630
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:56,288
谢谢你，医官
Thank you, Doctor.

631
00:46:13,514 --> 00:46:15,808
这些事可以绊住他
It will take him some time.

632
00:46:18,018 --> 00:46:20,146
舰长，在开始之前
Before we begin, Captain,

633
00:46:20,229 --> 00:46:24,233
我想知道普汀是怎么死的
I'd like to know exactly what happened to Putin.

634
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:31,532
他不是滑倒暴毙的吧？
He didn't slip on his tea, did he?

635
00:46:32,908 --> 00:46:34,952
我不喜欢你的口气，史拉文
I don't think I like your tone, Slavin.

636
00:46:35,035 --> 00:46:37,454
我的语气怎么了？
What the hell's my tone got to do with it?

637
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,134
我们是在冒生命危险
We're risking our lives here.

638
00:46:39,206 --> 00:46:41,802
普汀只会为我们制造麻烦
Putin could've caused complications.

639
00:46:42,543 --> 00:46:43,961
你认为他知道我们的计划后
Did you think he would just go away and sulk

640
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:46,463
会无动于衷吗？
while we carried out our plans?

641
00:46:46,547 --> 00:46:49,216
你是说他是被谋杀的？
Are you saying he was murdered?

642
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:52,136
- 我的天  - 别吵，尤里
- My God. - Stop whining, Yuri.

643
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,585
- 你要如何证明是谋杀？  - 那么那是真的罗？
- How can you justify murder? - So he was murdered.

644
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,945
我对这件事没什么意见
I have no opinion.

645
00:46:56,003 --> 00:46:57,510
他就是一头猪
The man was a pig,

646
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:00,227
但事前应该跟我们商量一下
but it's a decision we should've all made together.

647
00:47:00,352 --> 00:47:01,687
你无权在这发号施令
You are not in command here.

648
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:04,607
如果被其他人发现，恐怕会有人叛变
If the crew finds out, we could have a mutiny.

649
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,735
- 你说什么？  - 他们会把我们全部杀死
- What are you talking about? - They could kill us all.

650
00:47:07,860 --> 00:47:10,863
现在是牵一发而动全身
Everything that happens on this ship affects us all.

651
00:47:10,946 --> 00:47:13,199
军械长已经开始怀疑了
The Master-at-Arms is already suspicious.

652
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,764
我们还可以回头
We could still go back.

653
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:16,860
没有回头的余地了
There will be no going back.

654
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:21,382
在我们出发前
Before we sailed,

655
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:24,820
我寄了一封信给帕多林将军
I dispatched a letter to Admiral Padorin,

656
00:47:25,586 --> 00:47:28,964
信中告诉他们我们意图叛变
in which I announced our intention to defect.

657
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:34,136
你为什么那样做？
In the name of God, why?

658
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,375
当他抵达新大陆后
When he reached the New World,

659
00:47:36,472 --> 00:47:39,076
柯德便将船烧毁
Cortez burned his ships.

660
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:40,453
结果
As a result,

661
00:47:40,618 --> 00:47:42,541
他手下的士兵大受鼓舞
his men were well motivated.

662
00:47:43,229 --> 00:47:45,606
你这是帮我们判了死刑
You have signed our death warrants.

663
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:48,257
帕多林会发动整个舰队
Padorin will send the entire fleet.

664
00:47:48,447 --> 00:47:50,020
他们一定会找到我们的
Jesus, they'll find us.

665
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,237
一旦被找到…
They'll find us and...

666
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:54,448
没有人会找到我们，别再说了
No one's going to find us. That's enough, Yuri.

667
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:57,826
你非得这么做？
You had to do it,

668
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:01,538
不能就这样把潜艇移交到美国人手中？
you couldn't just turn the submarine over to the Americans.

669
00:48:01,622 --> 00:48:04,583
而非得做出一份政治声明？
You had to make a political statement.

670
00:48:05,526 --> 00:48:08,408
或是还有其他理由，舰长
Or was it something deeper, Captain,

671
00:48:09,171 --> 00:48:13,092
让你非要用这么激烈的手段吗？
something that made you unable to slip away?

672
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,151
是自我主义作祟吗？舰长
Was it ego, Captain?

673
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:18,185
我们都有自己的理由，维克特
We each have our reasons, Victor.

674
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,693
当我看到这艘舰艇的蓝图时
My own began the day I was handed the blueprints for this ship,

675
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,635
我知道这潜艇是为开战而制
a ship which had but one use.

676
00:48:27,106 --> 00:48:28,565
至于其他原因
And as for the rest,

677
00:48:28,649 --> 00:48:32,486
恕我不便奉告
those are things that I alone must carry the burden for.

678
00:48:34,613 --> 00:48:37,658
阿纳托利，你是在害怕我们的舰队？
Anatoli, you're afraid of our fleet.

679
00:48:38,993 --> 00:48:40,411
你是该怕
You should be.

680
00:48:40,494 --> 00:48:44,123
我个人认为我们有三分之一的成功机会
Personally, I give us one chance in three.

681
00:48:48,836 --> 00:48:50,796
谁还要茶？
More tea, anyone?

682
00:48:54,174 --> 00:48:55,676
都不要？
No?

683
00:48:57,011 --> 00:48:59,847
那就可以回去你们的岗位了
Then you may report back to your posts.

684
00:49:16,572 --> 00:49:19,158
你们都听见了，解散
You heard the Captain. Dismissed.

685
00:49:28,584 --> 00:49:30,336
舰长
Captain.

686
00:49:42,181 --> 00:49:44,850
舰长，我不会在别人面前反对你
Captain, I would never disagree with you in front of the men,

687
00:49:44,933 --> 00:49:46,518
你知道
you know that.

688
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:50,731
但维克特说的对
But in this case, Victor is right.

689
00:49:51,857 --> 00:49:55,527
将此事通知莫斯科当局并不妥
It would've been better if you had not informed Moscow.

690
00:49:55,611 --> 00:49:57,529
瓦西里
Vasily.

691
00:49:57,610 --> 00:49:59,628
不用害怕莫斯科
Moscow is not the worry,

692
00:50:00,116 --> 00:50:02,317
也不用担心整个苏联海军
nor the whole Soviet navy.

693
00:50:02,570 --> 00:50:04,872
我知道他们的战略
I know their tactics.

694
00:50:05,162 --> 00:50:06,910
这点我占优势
I have the advantage.

695
00:50:08,916 --> 00:50:10,542
不
No.

696
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,921
值得担心的是美国人
The worry is the Americans.

697
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:17,253
如果我们能碰对人
If we meet the right sort,

698
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:19,760
策略就会成功
this will work.

699
00:50:22,596 --> 00:50:25,891
如果找错人…
We get some buckaroo...

700
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:33,181
有乱流，长官
Some turbulence, Commander?

701
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,722
你讨厌坐飞机吧
You don't like flying.

702
00:50:36,091 --> 00:50:37,142
真不算什么
This is nothing!

703
00:50:37,152 --> 00:50:39,613
我们五个月前还碰过更强的乱流
You should've been with us five, six months ago!

704
00:50:39,738 --> 00:50:41,698
说到了呕吐
You talk about puke!

705
00:50:41,782 --> 00:50:45,035
我们在日本海上空遇到暴风云团
We ran into a hailstorm over the Sea of Japan, right?

706
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,121
大家把胆汁都吐出来了！
Everybody's retching their guts out!

707
00:50:47,246 --> 00:50:49,998
机长把午餐全吐到挡风玻璃上
The pilot shot his lunch all over the windshield,

708
00:50:50,082 --> 00:50:52,209
我则是吐到无线电上
and I barf on the radio!

709
00:50:52,292 --> 00:50:53,961
全都吐得一干二净
Knocked it out completely,

710
00:50:54,086 --> 00:50:55,879
呕吐物的重量可不轻！
and it wasn't that lightweight stuff either!

711
00:50:55,963 --> 00:50:58,715
增加了不少负担！
It was that chunky, industrial-weight puke!

712
00:50:58,799 --> 00:51:00,259
你想要尝一口吗？
You want a bite?

713
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:05,570
杰克，下次再有好点子时记在备忘录里
Jack, next time you get a bright idea, just put it in a memo.

714
00:51:09,476 --> 00:51:11,645
（美国海军企业号航空母舰）

715
00:51:11,811 --> 00:51:14,272
（北大西洋  新斯科细亚省东部）

716
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:16,483
长官
Sir.

717
00:51:17,651 --> 00:51:20,279
没事了，上尉，谢谢你
That'll be all, Lieutenant. Thank you.

718
00:51:20,362 --> 00:51:22,406
从魏蒙来的飞机？
That hawkeye from Weymouth Trap?

719
00:51:22,489 --> 00:51:25,367
途中遇到强烈的乱流
Four wire. Caught a gust over the fantail.

720
00:51:25,451 --> 00:51:27,244
运气还不错
Not bad, considering.

721
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,222
有位先生专程来见你
The gentleman is here to see you.

722
00:51:29,454 --> 00:51:30,580
先生？
The gentleman?

723
00:51:30,664 --> 00:51:33,459
你到底说什么呢，查理？
What the hell you talking about, Charlie?

724
00:51:33,542 --> 00:51:35,377
抱歉穿了你们的军服，长官
I apologize for the uniform, sir.

725
00:51:35,461 --> 00:51:38,589
格里尔将军希望此事能低调处理
This is Admiral Greer's idea of a low profile.

726
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,149
你为吉姆格里尔工作
You work for Jim Greer?

727
00:51:40,353 --> 00:51:41,755
对，长官
That's right, sir.

728
00:51:42,468 --> 00:51:46,346
你能否告诉我这是怎么一回事
Then I imagine you'll tell me what all the hubbub's about.

729
00:51:47,473 --> 00:51:50,017
舰长，你有空吗？
Captain, you got a minute?

730
00:51:50,976 --> 00:51:53,353
琼斯有事要报告
Jonesy's got something I think you ought to see.

731
00:51:53,479 --> 00:51:55,439
马丁，去喝杯咖啡
Martinez, get yourself a cup of coffee.

732
00:51:55,522 --> 00:51:58,233
- 再给我倒杯茶上来  - 是，舰长
- Send me up some tea. - Aye, Captain.

733
00:51:59,026 --> 00:52:01,987
传令兵，给舰长倒杯茶来
Messenger, get the captain a cup of tea.

734
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:05,286
舰长
Captain.

735
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:07,705
长官
Sir,

736
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:11,305
记得我说我听到歌声的事吗？
the moment that sub went silent and I thought I heard some singing,

737
00:52:11,705 --> 00:52:13,874
我从背景听到些很微弱的声音
I heard something in the background real faint.

738
00:52:13,990 --> 00:52:16,287
跟丢潜艇之后，我又听到了
After all those subs took off, I caught it again,

739
00:52:16,392 --> 00:52:18,064
并把声音录了下来
and got it on tape.

740
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:20,353
我在电脑上处理过了
I washed it through the computer

741
00:52:20,414 --> 00:52:22,880
并把这个声音分离出来
and was able to isolate this sound.

742
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,722
电脑分析出来的结果是
When I asked the computer to identify it,

743
00:52:28,847 --> 00:52:31,642
岩浆断层
what I got was magma displacement.

744
00:52:31,725 --> 00:52:34,186
长官，声纳分析仪
You see, sir, the SAPS software

745
00:52:34,269 --> 00:52:36,897
最初就是用来监测地震的
was originally written to look for seismic events.

746
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,999
当仪器感到困惑时，有点像…
I think when it gets confused, it kind of...

747
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:40,811
跑回家找妈妈
runs home to mama.

748
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,720
琼斯，我不太明白你的意思
I'm not following you, Jonesy.

749
00:52:43,189 --> 00:52:44,270
对不起，长官
Sir, I'm sorry.

750
00:52:44,363 --> 00:52:47,574
用十倍速来听
Listen to it at 10 times speed.

751
00:52:55,082 --> 00:52:57,793
那是人为的声音，舰长
Now, that's got to be manmade, Captain.

752
00:52:58,126 --> 00:52:59,628
好吧
All right.

753
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:03,970
第一次信号是在9点15分
The first contact was at 09:15,

754
00:53:04,111 --> 00:53:05,636
方位269
and the bearing was 2-6-9.

755
00:53:05,801 --> 00:53:07,177
九点半时它在这里
At 09:30, it was here.

756
00:53:07,413 --> 00:53:09,738
11点和11点15分时
I came back to it at 11:00 and 11:15, 

757
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,260
分别是在这里和这里
here and here.

758
00:53:12,057 --> 00:53:14,893
记得苏联潜艇
Remember the dispatch we got about Russian sub skippers

759
00:53:14,977 --> 00:53:17,187
曾以高速通过雷克屋脊
running the Reykjanes Ridge at high speeds

760
00:53:17,271 --> 00:53:20,482
因为他们拥有高精度的水下峡谷监测设备
because they had hyper-accurate surveys of the underwater canyons?

761
00:53:20,566 --> 00:53:25,028
索尔断崖正是那些峡谷的主要入口
The front door to those canyons was a formation called Thor's Twins.

762
00:53:25,112 --> 00:53:26,655
怎么了？
Yeah?

763
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:30,950
（失去信号）

764
00:53:37,999 --> 00:53:39,584
（索尔断崖）

765
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:41,242
看着
Look at that.

766
00:53:43,297 --> 00:53:45,799
- 正好是一号红色路线  - 舰长
- Right into Red Route One. - Captain.

767
00:53:47,670 --> 00:53:48,651
你可能觉得我疯了
You may think I'm crazy,

768
00:53:48,704 --> 00:53:50,902
我敢打赌那个岩浆断层
but I'll bet that magma displacement

769
00:53:51,037 --> 00:53:53,382
就是某种新型的俄国潜艇
was actually some new Russian sub,

770
00:53:53,807 --> 00:53:56,476
而且正朝冰岛前进
and it's headed for the Iceland coast.

771
00:53:58,353 --> 00:54:00,939
我有没有听错，琼斯？
Have I got this straight, Jonesy?

772
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:02,676
一台价值四千万的电脑
A $40 million computer

773
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,475
告诉你说那是地震
tells you you're chasing an earthquake,

774
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,735
然而你不信
but you don't believe it,

775
00:54:05,978 --> 00:54:08,260
却凭自己的主观臆断？
and you come up with this on your own?

776
00:54:09,823 --> 00:54:12,576
- 是，长官  - 你还有其他的航行数据吗？
- Yes, sir. - Including all the navigation math?

777
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,145
- 长官，我掌握了所有…  - 别紧张，我信你
- Sir, I've got all the... - Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.

778
00:54:17,122 --> 00:54:21,126
汤米，你马上策划一条最快路线
Tommy, I want you to plot us a speed course

779
00:54:21,209 --> 00:54:24,254
到达红色一线的底部
for the bottom end of Red Route One.

780
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:25,984
进峡谷后我们就追不到它了
We'll never find him in those canyons.

781
00:54:26,522 --> 00:54:28,590
首先上升到了望深度
First take us to periscope depth.

782
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:30,097
看有没有讯息传进来
This we got to phone in.

783
00:54:30,235 --> 00:54:31,567
是，船长
Aye, aye, Captain.

784
00:54:40,729 --> 00:54:43,023
等等，琼斯
Hang on, Jonesy.

785
00:54:47,197 --> 00:54:49,222
如果距离拉近
If I can get you close enough,

786
00:54:49,824 --> 00:54:51,490
你有办法辨别潜艇方位吗？
can you track this sucker?

787
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:54,284
是，长官
Yes, sir.

788
00:54:54,368 --> 00:54:57,579
我已经知道应该追踪什么声音，我一定会抓住他的
Now that I know what to listen for, I'll bag him.

789
00:54:59,206 --> 00:55:01,541
- 回去岗位吧  - 是，长官
- Carry on. - Yes, sir.

790
00:55:03,168 --> 00:55:05,504
那是我听说过的最疯狂的事
That's the craziest notion I've ever heard.

791
00:55:05,580 --> 00:55:07,131
现役军官？
A serving line officer?

792
00:55:07,272 --> 00:55:09,500
带着一整艘潜艇？
An entire ballistic missile submarine?

793
00:55:09,591 --> 00:55:11,009
不可能所有人都想叛变
They can't all want to defect.

794
00:55:11,093 --> 00:55:13,804
就只有军官想变节，也令人难以相信
Even if it's only the officers, it's extremely difficult to believe.

795
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,192
他有何计划？
What's his plan?

796
00:55:15,471 --> 00:55:16,510
计划？
His plan?

797
00:55:17,933 --> 00:55:21,103
俄国人喜欢依计划行事
Russians don't take a dump, son, without a plan.

798
00:55:21,186 --> 00:55:23,563
高级将领不会未经深思熟虑
Senior captains don't start something this dangerous

799
00:55:23,689 --> 00:55:25,273
就贸然采取行动
without having thought the matter through.

800
00:55:25,357 --> 00:55:26,441
是不是他打算
What's he going to do,

801
00:55:26,525 --> 00:55:28,735
将潜艇直接驶进纽约，说他想投诚吧？
sail into New York, pop the hatch, and say here I am?

802
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:30,737
可能就是那么简单
It might be just that simple, yes.

803
00:55:30,862 --> 00:55:33,824
若只牵涉到中央情报局，事情也许会很简单
Things may appear simple in the cubicle at CIA,

804
00:55:33,907 --> 00:55:35,325
但是在大西洋上
but in the middle of the Atlantic

805
00:55:35,409 --> 00:55:37,994
有一票苏联舰艇正虎视眈眈
with Soviet warships bearing down on us,

806
00:55:38,078 --> 00:55:39,162
情况就会变得很复杂
they get more complex.

807
00:55:39,246 --> 00:55:42,207
- 来根烟吗？  - 不用了，谢谢
- Smoke? - No, thank you.

808
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:45,585
而且我认为登舰检查
And I don't think your notion of a few days' inspection

809
00:55:45,711 --> 00:55:47,504
这个主意也行不通
is going to wash either.

810
00:55:47,587 --> 00:55:50,966
要对该潜艇有相当的研究成果
In order to be of any value, you'd have to tear it apart.

811
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:52,968
必需花费数月的时间
The metallurgy would take a couple of months.

812
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,411
那么我们就必须扣住潜艇
Then we'd have to keep it.

813
00:55:54,908 --> 00:55:56,740
你怎么处置那些船员呢？
What will you do with the crew?

814
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:59,437
不想变节的人回去后
Ones that don't defect will go back

815
00:55:59,515 --> 00:56:01,100
会说是我们扣住潜艇
and say we got the boat.

816
00:56:01,893 --> 00:56:05,063
你打算杀死他们？
Or do you plan to eliminate them?

817
00:56:06,231 --> 00:56:07,983
我们这不是在打仗，长官
We're not at war, sir.

818
00:56:08,066 --> 00:56:11,862
唯一的办法就是让这些人离开潜艇
So you have to get them off the boat in such a way

819
00:56:11,945 --> 00:56:13,697
别让他们知道潜艇被扣留
that they think we don't have it,

820
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:17,534
这些人遣返后也会说潜艇不在我们手上
and they'll report that we don't have it to their bosses.

821
00:56:17,617 --> 00:56:21,329
否则计划根本不会成功
Otherwise, this whole business is just academic, right?

822
00:56:22,914 --> 00:56:25,667
是，长官，我完全同意你的看法
Yes, sir. I think I see your point.

823
00:56:28,086 --> 00:56:30,464
你多久没睡了？
When's the last time you slept?

824
00:56:31,590 --> 00:56:33,467
有一阵子了
A while.

825
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,973
参谋长会带你去休息一会
The chief outside will fix you up.

826
00:56:36,301 --> 00:56:37,840
谢谢你，长官
Thank you, sir.

827
00:56:38,805 --> 00:56:40,682
舰长
Captain.

828
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,825
到天亮还有几个小时
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.

829
00:56:47,261 --> 00:56:48,900
我们在指挥中心等你
We'll be in the CIC.

830
00:56:49,191 --> 00:56:52,611
这次似乎有点失去控制了
Things are liable to get a little dicey around here.

831
00:56:53,361 --> 00:56:54,946
没错，长官
Yes, sir.

832
00:57:02,968 --> 00:57:04,290
你认为他是不是疯了？
You think he's crazy?

833
00:57:04,662 --> 00:57:05,860
肯定是
Certifiable.

834
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:07,928
我不管他的地位有多高
No matter what his credentials,

835
00:57:08,011 --> 00:57:10,113
我还是不喜欢他穿着海军制服
I don't care for him wearing the uniform.

836
00:57:10,837 --> 00:57:13,673
你看到他手上的戒指了吗？
Did you see that ring on his finger?

837
00:57:13,790 --> 00:57:15,934
他是海军陆战队72级的成员
The academy, class of '72. A Marine.

838
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,260
你开玩笑
You're kidding.

839
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:19,638
- 你怎么知道…  - 格里尔告诉我的
- How did you... - Greer told me.

840
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:21,148
三年级的暑假
Summer of his third year,

841
00:57:21,255 --> 00:57:23,556
他在一场直升机失事中受伤
he went down in a chopper accident.

842
00:57:24,059 --> 00:57:26,436
所有其他组员都殉难
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

843
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,607
他花了十个月进行复健
That kid spent 10 months in traction...

844
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,231
又用了一年才重新学会走路
and another year learning to walk again.

845
00:57:32,067 --> 00:57:35,195
他在医院里完成了第四年的学业
He did his fourth year from the hospital.

846
00:57:35,987 --> 00:57:37,155
你看着办吧，查理
It's up to you, Charlie,

847
00:57:37,239 --> 00:57:40,867
不过我希望你能对他客气些
but you might consider cutting the kid a little slack.

848
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:47,916
反正苏联舰队也会在我们之前找到它
Russians are going to find that sub before we get near it, anyway.

849
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,142
长官，我们正通过索尔断崖
Passing Thor's Twins, sir.

850
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:12,560
很好
Very good.

851
00:58:17,946 --> 00:58:19,614
舰长，现在我们正通过索尔断崖
Passing the Twins now, Captain.

852
00:58:19,698 --> 00:58:21,950
很好，你可以展开行动了
Very good. You may commence your run.

853
00:58:22,030 --> 00:58:23,355
到第一个弯道时再告诉我
Call me at the first turning.

854
00:58:23,473 --> 00:58:24,480
是的，舰长
Aye, Captain.

855
00:58:25,537 --> 00:58:27,581
卡玛若夫
Mr. Kamarov.

856
00:58:28,081 --> 00:58:30,500
- 你现在可以展开行动了  - 是，长官
- You may commence your run now. - Aye, sir.

857
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,138
听我指令行进第一航程
First leg on my mark,

858
00:58:32,411 --> 00:58:34,163
航道260
course 2-6-0.

859
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:36,028
航速18节
Speed, 18 knots.

860
00:58:36,345 --> 00:58:38,800
深度270米
Depth, 270 meters.

861
00:58:39,134 --> 00:58:44,222
五、四、三、二、一
Five, four, three, two, one.

862
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,933
行动
Mark.

863
00:58:47,058 --> 00:58:49,477
控制室，航道260
Diving command, course 2-6-0.

864
00:58:49,561 --> 00:58:52,022
- 航道260  - 航速18节
- Course 2-6-0, aye. - Speed, 18 knots.

865
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:53,266
航速18节
Speed, 18 knots, aye.

866
00:58:53,327 --> 00:58:54,949
别这么胆小，尤里
Stop pissing, Yuri.

867
00:58:55,567 --> 00:58:57,152
把表和地图给我
Give me a stopwatch and a map,

868
00:58:57,235 --> 00:59:00,155
我闭着眼都能飞越阿尔卑斯山
and I'll fly the Alps in a plane with no windows.

869
00:59:00,238 --> 00:59:02,741
但是地图必须很精准
If the map is accurate enough.

870
00:59:24,512 --> 00:59:27,557
我们已经靠近第一个弯道
We're in the lane and approaching first turn.

871
00:59:27,641 --> 00:59:31,394
30秒后左转航道195
Come left to course 1-9-5.

872
00:59:31,478 --> 00:59:35,148
上升至200米
In 30 seconds, decrease depth to 200 meters.

873
00:59:35,273 --> 00:59:36,691
航速不变
Maintain speed.

874
00:59:36,775 --> 00:59:38,985
很好，引航员
Very good, Navigator.

875
00:59:40,362 --> 00:59:42,280
舰长，我们正接近第一个弯道
Captain, we're approaching the first turn.

876
00:59:42,364 --> 00:59:43,865
25秒后转向航道195
Twenty-five seconds to course 1-9-5.

877
00:59:43,940 --> 00:59:46,436
加速至26节
Increase speed to 26 knots...

878
00:59:46,566 --> 00:59:47,780
重新计算
and recompute.

879
00:59:51,206 --> 00:59:53,166
是，舰长
Aye, Captain.

880
00:59:54,542 --> 00:59:57,671
引航员，航速26节，重新计算
Navigator, recompute for 26 knots.

881
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:01,049
准备开始
Turn on my mark.

882
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:05,680
五、四、三、二、一
Five, four, three, two, one.

883
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:06,880
行动
Mark.

884
01:00:06,972 --> 01:00:09,349
控制室，左转航道195
Diving control, come left to 1-9-5.

885
01:00:09,474 --> 01:00:11,977
- 仰角左转  - 左转195
- Come left to 1-9-5. - Up on the bow planes.

886
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:23,200
航道195，航速保持…
Course now 1-9-5 and maintaining speed...

887
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:25,150
26节
26 knots.

888
01:00:29,536 --> 01:00:31,371
卡玛若夫
Mr. Kamarov?

889
01:00:31,870 --> 01:00:33,280
下一航段，舰长
Next leg, Captain,

890
01:00:33,675 --> 01:00:36,330
右转航道240，再过…
come right to course 2-4-0 now at...

891
01:00:37,711 --> 01:00:39,462
8分40秒后
eight minutes and 40 seconds.

892
01:00:39,540 --> 01:00:42,486
很好，保持航线和航速
Very good. Maintain course and speed.

893
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:47,953
太快了，瓦西里
Too fast, Vasily.

894
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,550
太快了
Too fast.

895
01:00:50,295 --> 01:00:52,295
这些图表都是精确地列出的
Those charts are laid out precisely.

896
01:00:52,414 --> 01:00:55,324
短时间内这么快的速度会造成危险
So many knots for so many seconds.

897
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:57,269
这件事太愚蠢了
And this thing handles like a pig.

898
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:59,424
说话小心点，斯拉文先生
Watch your bearing, Mr. Slavin.

899
01:01:06,906 --> 01:01:09,159
15秒后转向，舰长
Fifteen seconds to turn, Captain.

900
01:01:09,242 --> 01:01:11,911
- 要减速吗？  - 不要
- Should we decrease speed? - Negative.

901
01:01:12,037 --> 01:01:14,998
- 准备右转  - 是，长官
- Prepare to come right. - Aye, sir.

902
01:01:15,081 --> 01:01:19,002
八、七、六、五
Eight, seven, six, five,

903
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:22,483
四、三、二、一
four, three, two, one.

904
01:01:22,861 --> 01:01:23,790
行动
Mark.

905
01:01:23,882 --> 01:01:26,176
俯角15度
Fifteen degrees down angle on the bow planes.

906
01:01:26,259 --> 01:01:29,637
右转航道240，开始转向
Come right 2-4-0. Move it!

907
01:01:49,157 --> 01:01:50,617
我们在航道上了
We're in the lane.

908
01:01:50,742 --> 01:01:54,162
34分钟后到达海王断层
Next leg 34 minutes to the Neptune Massif.

909
01:01:54,245 --> 01:01:57,248
航道240
Course 2-4-0.

910
01:02:09,469 --> 01:02:11,304
发生什么事？
What happened?

911
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:12,850
降温系统失常
The cryogenic plant!

912
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:14,591
磁石无法冷却
The magnets aren't cooling.

913
01:02:14,682 --> 01:02:18,478
履带推进器温度已升高至50度，超过警戒范围
Temperature in the caterpillar is 50 degrees above red line and rising.

914
01:02:18,593 --> 01:02:20,480
如果不尽快停止运作，履带会很快融化
If we don't shut down, it's going to melt.

915
01:02:20,602 --> 01:02:22,810
立刻关掉！
Kill it! Shut it down!

916
01:02:27,195 --> 01:02:29,656
- 舰长？  - 什么情况？
- Captain? - What happened?

917
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:31,882
降温系统失效
The cryogenic plant failed.

918
01:02:32,044 --> 01:02:33,617
反应炉有损坏吗？
Reactor damage?

919
01:02:34,202 --> 01:02:37,038
动力受到部分影响，不过反应炉没受到损坏
There was a power spike, but the reactor scrammed automatically.

920
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,494
有没有辐射外泄？
Was there any radiation leakage?

921
01:02:39,584 --> 01:02:41,120
我还不清楚
I don't know yet!

922
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,587
- 多久能修复？  - 我先得知道出了什么问题
- How long will it take to fix? - I got to find what's wrong first.

923
01:02:44,671 --> 01:02:48,007
可能是液氦出了问题，也可能是导体坏掉
Could be the liquid helium or the superconductors.

924
01:02:50,051 --> 01:02:53,930
舰长，在履带推进器修复之前我们不得不停下了
Captain, we will have to stop until we can repair the caterpillar unit.

925
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:54,803
不行
Negative.

926
01:02:54,944 --> 01:02:56,800
使用正常动力前进
We'll run on normal propulsion.

927
01:02:58,518 --> 01:03:00,812
舰长，如此一来会发出声音
Captain, we will not be silent.

928
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:03,302
航速改为20节
Make revolutions for 20 knots...

929
01:03:03,421 --> 01:03:05,350
然后启动螺旋桨
and engage the propellers.

930
01:03:09,154 --> 01:03:10,738
是，舰长
Aye, Captain.

931
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,737
启动引擎
Commence engine start-up.

932
01:03:13,106 --> 01:03:15,160
他会害死大家
He'll get us all killed.

933
01:03:19,664 --> 01:03:22,333
舰长有他的道理
The Captain knows what he's doing.

934
01:03:23,251 --> 01:03:24,752
医官
Doctor.

935
01:03:27,005 --> 01:03:28,673
海军演习？
Naval activities?

936
01:03:29,500 --> 01:03:31,286
我完全不懂海事
I have no knowledge of this.

937
01:03:31,451 --> 01:03:33,460
也没当过海军
But then, I never was a sailor.

938
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:35,106
大使先生
Mr. Ambassador,

939
01:03:35,396 --> 01:03:38,008
目前有100艘贵国舰艇
you have nearly 100 vessels operating

940
01:03:38,072 --> 01:03:39,970
齐集大西洋上
in the North Atlantic right now.

941
01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:42,437
贵国的飞机所投下的声纳浮标
Your aircraft have dropped enough sonar buoys

942
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:45,648
多得可以让人从格陵兰岛走到苏格兰
that a man could walk from Greenland to Scotland

943
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,065
而且脚都不会打湿
without getting his feet wet.

944
01:03:47,178 --> 01:03:49,560
你别再跟我打哈哈了
Shall we dispense with the bull?

945
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:54,014
你的用辞真是委婉，皮尔特先生
You make your point as delicately as ever, Mr. Pelt,

946
01:03:54,378 --> 01:03:55,150
可是…
but...

947
01:03:55,241 --> 01:03:59,495
而且看似演习也可能是开战的前兆
And what looks like an exercise could be a prelude to war.

948
01:03:59,579 --> 01:04:01,206
你怎么区分它们？
How can we tell the difference?

949
01:04:01,289 --> 01:04:05,001
为了小心起见，我们必须检查你们的舰队
Prudence demands that we deploy ships to observe yours.

950
01:04:05,084 --> 01:04:07,212
贵国政府应该知道
Your government should consider

951
01:04:07,295 --> 01:04:12,091
双方舰队及战机在如此频繁的接触下
that having your ships and ours, your aircraft and ours,

952
01:04:12,217 --> 01:04:16,471
如此的接近是很危险的事
in such proximity is inherently dangerous.

953
01:04:17,055 --> 01:04:20,433
大使先生，战争就是那样开始的
Wars have begun that way, Mr. Ambassador.

954
01:04:29,730 --> 01:04:31,813
我方有一艘潜艇失踪了
We have lost one of our submarines.

955
01:04:32,190 --> 01:04:32,966
失踪了？
Lost it?

956
01:04:33,062 --> 01:04:35,004
我们怀疑潜艇可能失事…
We fear she may be down, and...

957
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:37,437
这有点难以启齿，可是…
This is most embarrassing, but...

958
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:40,740
舰上有部分军官是…
Several of the officers are sons of...

959
01:04:41,658 --> 01:04:43,410
高干子弟
high party officials.

960
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,575
还有一个是中央委员的孩子
One is even the son of a Central Committee Member.

961
01:04:47,697 --> 01:04:48,384
我…
I...

962
01:04:48,795 --> 01:04:50,672
不能说是谁
cannot say which.

963
01:04:51,464 --> 01:04:54,550
你说这是大规模的营救行动？
You're telling me this is a massive rescue operation?

964
01:04:54,634 --> 01:04:56,594
对
That is correct.

965
01:04:59,764 --> 01:05:03,142
很抱歉，我们能做些什么？
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

966
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,051
我不清楚…
I'm not sure that...

967
01:05:07,951 --> 01:05:10,287
或者展开一次联合营救任务？
Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

968
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,528
谢谢你的提议，先生
That is very gracious of you, sir.

969
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:17,990
我会向上级传达
I'll pass your offer on.

970
01:05:19,617 --> 01:05:21,077
目前来看
But at this time,

971
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:24,122
我相信情况仍在我方的掌握中
I think we're doing everything that can be done.

972
01:05:27,792 --> 01:05:29,293
（大熊狐步692号）

973
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,170
（苏联反潜机）

974
01:05:31,337 --> 01:05:32,963
（冰岛南部）

975
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,691
舰长？
Captain?

976
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:50,502
我们根据你的意见来策划
Our strategy depends on your answer.

977
01:05:50,778 --> 01:05:52,980
整个舰队都会知道我们的位置
The entire fleet will know where we are.

978
01:05:53,060 --> 01:05:54,431
舰长，声纳信息
Captain, Sonar.

979
01:05:54,555 --> 01:05:58,110
有艘涡轮螺旋桨潜艇在附近
We've been overflown by a multi-engine turboprop.

980
01:05:58,197 --> 01:05:59,824
放到扩音器上
Put it on audio.

981
01:06:03,328 --> 01:06:06,331
正从我们旁边通过
Short transients, close aboard.

982
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:08,182
排水门有东西进入
Water entry of small objects.

983
01:06:08,535 --> 01:06:10,200
是声纳浮标
Sonar buoys.

984
01:06:11,377 --> 01:06:14,088
- 准备应战  - 准备应战
- Battle stations. - Battle stations!

985
01:06:14,172 --> 01:06:16,382
- 准备应战  - 准备应战
- Battle stations! - Battle stations!

986
01:06:16,507 --> 01:06:19,177
还有多久到海王断层
How long to Neptune Massif?

987
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,429
多久？
How long?

988
01:06:22,312 --> 01:06:23,840
四分十秒
Four minutes, 10 seconds.

989
01:06:25,183 --> 01:06:26,976
我们要下潜吗，舰长？
Should we bottom the boat?

990
01:06:27,060 --> 01:06:30,521
不，现在那样做太迟了，我们没时间了
No. Too late now. We've run out of time.

991
01:06:31,522 --> 01:06:33,858
进行反制，准备发射飞弹
Countermeasures. Prepare to launch missiles.

992
01:06:33,941 --> 01:06:35,401
是，长官
Aye, sir.

993
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,162
上方有战机出现
Aircraft on computer guidance.

994
01:06:45,220 --> 01:06:47,357
请求发射炮弹
Request permission to launch.

995
01:06:47,580 --> 01:06:50,375
请求照准
You are authorized to launch the weapon.

996
01:06:51,876 --> 01:06:53,878
炮弹已发射
Weapon is away.

997
01:06:58,383 --> 01:07:01,719
全速前进，有鱼雷接近
High speed screw! Torpedo in the water!

998
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:03,805
抓稳
Stand by.

999
01:07:04,138 --> 01:07:06,307
鱼雷持续接近
Torpedo is active.

1000
01:07:08,226 --> 01:07:10,561
鱼雷已锁定我舰
Torpedo has acquired.

1001
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:11,945
发射反鱼雷装置
Launch countermeasures.

1002
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,094
发射反鱼雷装置，长官
Launch countermeasures. Aye, sir.

1003
01:07:20,113 --> 01:07:21,614
我们还在航线中
We're in the lane.

1004
01:07:21,730 --> 01:07:23,156
多久到达海王断层？
How long till the turn at Massif?

1005
01:07:23,338 --> 01:07:24,990
两分九秒
Two minutes, nine seconds.

1006
01:07:25,070 --> 01:07:27,540
进入峡谷后将无法避过鱼雷
We have no room to maneuver in these canyons.

1007
01:07:27,774 --> 01:07:30,088
- 如果反制不成功…  - 闭嘴
Shut up.

1008
01:07:35,253 --> 01:07:37,922
目标接近反鱼雷装置
Torpedo has reached countermeasures.

1009
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,611
没有命中
Torpedo has lost contact.

1010
01:07:39,694 --> 01:07:41,130
正在接近海王断层
Massif approaching.

1011
01:07:44,130 --> 01:07:46,039
鱼雷重新锁定我舰
Torpedo has reacquired.

1012
01:07:46,877 --> 01:07:49,180
鱼雷正朝我们而来
Torpedo has reacquired and is homing.

1013
01:07:50,643 --> 01:07:51,769
还多久进入断层？
Give me the count.

1014
01:07:51,853 --> 01:07:55,565
30秒后右舵40度
Turn at Massif 40 degrees starboard in 30 seconds.

1015
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:57,060
鱼雷命中时间？
Time to torpedo impact?

1016
01:07:57,429 --> 01:07:59,270
命中时间是35秒
Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.

1017
01:07:59,360 --> 01:08:01,863
- 提到高速  - 全速前进
- Increase to flank. - Full ahead flank.

1018
01:08:01,946 --> 01:08:04,574
- 全速前进  - 全速前进，明白
- Full ahead flank. - Full ahead flank, aye.

1019
01:08:04,657 --> 01:08:07,785
鱼雷40秒后命中目标
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.

1020
01:08:08,536 --> 01:08:10,121
35秒
35 seconds.

1021
01:08:17,628 --> 01:08:19,630
30秒
30 seconds.

1022
01:08:20,798 --> 01:08:22,842
进入断层倒数计时
Turn at Massif in

1023
01:08:22,967 --> 01:08:28,097
七、六、五、四
seven, six, five, four,

1024
01:08:28,180 --> 01:08:31,341
三、二、一
three, two, one.

1025
01:08:31,603 --> 01:08:32,310
好
Mark.

1026
01:08:32,393 --> 01:08:34,604
鱼雷25秒后命中
Torpedo impact 25 seconds...

1027
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,981
- 转弯吗，舰长？  - 还没
- The turn, Captain. - Not yet.

1028
01:08:39,984 --> 01:08:41,944
八秒后进入
Mark plus eight seconds.

1029
01:08:42,028 --> 01:08:46,782
9秒、10秒、11秒、12秒
Plus nine, plus 10 seconds, plus 11, plus 12,

1030
01:08:46,866 --> 01:08:51,329
13秒、14秒、15秒
plus 13 seconds, plus 14, plus 15 seconds.

1031
01:08:51,412 --> 01:08:54,290
舰长，我们不宜偏离航道这么远
Captain, we're out of position by a boat length.

1032
01:08:54,373 --> 01:08:57,168
鱼雷15秒后命中
Torpedo impact now 15 seconds.

1033
01:08:57,668 --> 01:08:59,295
发出警报
Sound collision.

1034
01:08:59,370 --> 01:09:00,461
发出警报
Sound collision.

1035
01:09:00,629 --> 01:09:02,497
我们偏离航线了
We're out of the lane!

1036
01:09:02,673 --> 01:09:04,884
- 回去岗位上  - 伯罗丁？
- You're relieved. - Borodin?

1037
01:09:11,057 --> 01:09:13,434
右满舵！全速右转！
Right full rudder! Reverse starboard engine!

1038
01:09:13,518 --> 01:09:15,686
右满舵，全速右转
Right full rudder. All back starboard shaft.

1039
01:09:15,770 --> 01:09:18,356
全速倒退
All back starboard shaft!

1040
01:09:20,233 --> 01:09:23,402
鱼雷12秒后命中
Torpedo impact 12 seconds,

1041
01:09:23,528 --> 01:09:29,742
十、九、八、七、六、五
10, nine, eight, seven, six, five...

1042
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,548
舰长
Captain,

1043
01:10:01,948 --> 01:10:03,690
- 他们真的向我们开炮了！  - 镇静！
- they're really shooting at us! - Pull yourself together!

1044
01:10:03,776 --> 01:10:04,902
为什么？
Why?

1045
01:10:05,403 --> 01:10:07,196
冷静点，孩子
Boy! Easy, boy.

1046
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,506
如果我们真的被击中
If they were really shooting at us,

1047
01:10:10,428 --> 01:10:11,700
我们现在已经死了
we'd be dead by now.

1048
01:10:11,784 --> 01:10:13,786
给我一个解释
Give me some line.

1049
01:10:31,137 --> 01:10:34,890
我找出履带推进器故障的原因了
I found out what happened to the caterpillar.

1050
01:10:34,974 --> 01:10:38,394
是缓冲线路遭破坏
The buffer circuit has been torn out.

1051
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,055
故障是迟早的事
It was only a matter of time...

1052
01:10:40,293 --> 01:10:42,560
毕竟是超负荷运载
before an overload shut it down.

1053
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,733
你说什么？
What are you saying?

1054
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:45,893
不管是谁，他知道如何破坏
Whoever did this knew how to cripple

1055
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:48,684
这个不容易发现的履带推进器
the caterpillar in a way not easy to find.

1056
01:10:49,155 --> 01:10:52,199
舰长，我们的舰上有间谍
Captain, we have a saboteur on board.

1057
01:10:56,787 --> 01:10:58,914
不可能是军官
It can't be any of the officers.

1058
01:10:58,998 --> 01:11:01,667
否则早在出海前他就行动了
They had plenty of time before we embarked.

1059
01:11:01,792 --> 01:11:03,711
肯定是船员
Must be a crew member.

1060
01:11:04,503 --> 01:11:06,297
到普汀的舱房去
Go to Putin's cabin.

1061
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:09,884
查一下船员资料
Check his files for information on the crew.

1062
01:11:09,967 --> 01:11:13,346
要想办法让他们离舰
We may have to put them off before we planned.

1063
01:11:14,972 --> 01:11:18,976
俄国人喜欢依计划行事
The average russky, son, don't take a dump without a plan.

1064
01:11:21,479 --> 01:11:23,522
等一下
Wait a minute.

1065
01:11:25,066 --> 01:11:27,318
根本不用我们操心，他会想办法
We don't have to get the crew off the sub.

1066
01:11:27,401 --> 01:11:29,654
他势必要这么做
He would have had to do that.

1067
01:11:29,737 --> 01:11:33,032
我们只需要想他会怎么做
We just have to figure out what he's going to do.

1068
01:11:35,201 --> 01:11:37,536
他要如何让船员离开潜艇？
How is he going to get them off the sub?

1069
01:11:38,746 --> 01:11:41,582
而且是自愿离舰
They'd have to want to get off.

1070
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:46,587
怎么让船员自愿离开潜艇？
How do you get a crew to want to get off a submarine?

1071
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:52,301
怎么能让船员自愿离开一艘核潜艇…
How do you get them to want to get off a nuclear sub...

1072
01:11:52,385 --> 01:11:54,428
我知道他的计划了，将军
I know how he's going to evacuate the sub.

1073
01:11:54,512 --> 01:11:55,513
我现在没时间，杰克
Not now, Jack.

1074
01:11:55,596 --> 01:11:59,141
呼叫洋基一号，请覆述一遍
Yankee One star base, say again status.

1075
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,381
请求紧急支援
Declare an emergency.

1076
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:02,640
请求紧急支援
Declare an emergency.

1077
01:12:02,728 --> 01:12:04,522
洋基一号，请求无线电导航
Yankee One, requesting vectors.

1078
01:12:04,605 --> 01:12:07,858
航线270，加快速度
Vector 2-7-0 speed is buster.

1079
01:12:07,942 --> 01:12:09,652
洋基一号飞机液压失常
Yankee One's losing hydraulic pressure.

1080
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:11,570
覆述一遍，洋基一号
Say again, Yankee One.

1081
01:12:11,696 --> 01:12:14,156
一架银狐战机离编队距离太近
Bear Foxtrot got too close to the group.

1082
01:12:14,240 --> 01:12:17,660
其中一架F14试着隔开它，结果两机相撞
One of the F-14s crowded him, and they bumped.

1083
01:12:17,743 --> 01:12:20,329
飞机液压失常
He's losing hydraulic fluid.

1084
01:12:20,413 --> 01:12:23,332
航管正试着引导他落地
They're trying to get him back aboard now.

1085
01:12:23,416 --> 01:12:25,042
忙碌的早晨
Busy morning.

1086
01:12:26,585 --> 01:12:31,465
一群俄国攻击潜艇已经进驻大西洋东岸
Russian attack subs are now stationed off every east coast port.

1087
01:12:31,549 --> 01:12:33,426
我们在这里
We're up here.

1088
01:12:34,385 --> 01:12:36,679
纽泽西号正沿着海岸行进
The New Jersey is moving up the coast

1089
01:12:36,762 --> 01:12:39,807
苏联除出动超过100架银狐外
while the Russians, aside from over 100 Bear Foxtrots,

1090
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:43,519
还有多艘作战潜艇及海上舰队
have a row of subs and several surface groups.

1091
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,079
他们的火力太强了
That's a lot of firepower.

1092
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:46,810
对营救队伍来说，是的
For a rescue team, yes.

1093
01:12:47,398 --> 01:12:49,024
还有可疑的情况
There's something else strange.

1094
01:12:49,108 --> 01:12:51,819
他们好像正在利用声纳系统寻找些什么
They're using sonar as if they're looking for something,

1095
01:12:51,902 --> 01:12:54,405
- 但是却没人监听  - 什么意思？
- but nobody's listening. - What do you mean?

1096
01:12:54,511 --> 01:12:56,202
舰队的航速已接近30节
The rate close to 30 knots.

1097
01:12:56,348 --> 01:12:59,740
而那样的速度发出的声音可以摧毁我女儿的立体音响
At their speed they could run over my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

1098
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,998
他们不是在寻找雷米思，而是在驱赶他
They're not searching for Ramius. They're driving him.

1099
01:13:04,081 --> 01:13:06,250
把他赶到哪去？
Driving him where?

1100
01:13:09,750 --> 01:13:11,843
就像猎犬紧追猎物一样
The hounds to the hunters.

1101
01:13:12,250 --> 01:13:15,264
你的舰长准备向美国投诚是吗，莱恩先生？
Your sub captain's going to make it to America.

1102
01:13:16,469 --> 01:13:19,305
他可能壮志未酬身先死
He's going to die within sight of it.

1103
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,767
他的指挥官一直请求开火
His wing man kept requesting permission to fire.

1104
01:13:22,850 --> 01:13:24,560
一个不小心
Somebody messes up,

1105
01:13:24,643 --> 01:13:27,438
就可能爆发前所未有的海战
we'll be in the biggest naval battle since the Jutland.

1106
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:29,523
天啊！
Jesus!

1107
01:13:30,024 --> 01:13:32,610
海水太冷了，无法驱逐他
Water's too cold to eject him.

1108
01:13:32,690 --> 01:13:34,433
苏联空军想把它逼上水面
Air boss will try to bring him aboard.

1109
01:13:34,671 --> 01:13:37,046
请问这艘是谁的潜艇？
Sir, what's this sub off by herself?

1110
01:13:37,364 --> 01:13:39,158
巴特曼库索的潜艇
Bart Mancuso's boat.

1111
01:13:39,283 --> 01:13:42,578
他将要去红色一线
He's going to the bottom of Red Route One.

1112
01:13:42,661 --> 01:13:46,665
他断断续续的收到一些岩浆断层的信号
He's had intermittent contact with a magma displacement.

1113
01:13:46,791 --> 01:13:48,918
- 他…  - 岩浆断层？
- He's got this... - Magma displacement?

1114
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,407
像地震异常？
Is that like a seismic anomaly?

1115
01:13:51,722 --> 01:13:53,040
我想是，怎么了？
I suppose so. Why?

1116
01:13:53,672 --> 01:13:56,217
你能送我上达拉斯号吗？
Is there a way you could get me onboard the Dallas?

1117
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:57,426
去干什么？
What for?

1118
01:13:57,510 --> 01:14:00,364
我认为曼库索舰长已经发现了红色十月
I think Mancuso's found the Red October.

1119
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,260
他什么都没发现，杰克
He hasn't found anything, Jack.

1120
01:14:02,530 --> 01:14:03,451
他只是在等待
He's just waiting.

1121
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:04,566
不确定他听到…
Not sure what he hear...

1122
01:14:04,629 --> 01:14:06,359
这套无声推进系统
Sir, this silent propulsion system

1123
01:14:06,431 --> 01:14:08,220
很容易被误认为…
could easily be mistaken for something...

1124
01:14:08,312 --> 01:14:12,441
只有直升机能送你上达拉斯号
The only way to get you onto Dallas is to fly you out to a chopper.

1125
01:14:12,525 --> 01:14:14,068
是把你送到最北部的唯一方法
The only way to get you that far north

1126
01:14:14,151 --> 01:14:16,862
而且必须用飞快的速度才能赶上
is to use a chopper turned into a flying gas can.

1127
01:14:16,980 --> 01:14:18,020
将军
Admiral,

1128
01:14:18,304 --> 01:14:21,200
洋基一号即将落地，救援人员已经就位
Yankee One is on final. Rescue personnel are in place.

1129
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,248
提拉高左翼，你太偏左了
Pick up your left wing. You're drifting left.

1130
01:14:24,439 --> 01:14:25,893
提升动力！
Power, power!

1131
01:14:25,996 --> 01:14:28,165
机头拉高…
Wave off, wave off!

1132
01:14:28,249 --> 01:14:30,501
快弹出
Eject, eject, eject!

1133
01:14:40,219 --> 01:14:44,014
着火了、着火了！飞行甲板起火了！
Fire, fire! Fire on the flight deck!

1134
01:14:44,090 --> 01:14:46,075
这件事将要失控了
This business will get out of control,

1135
01:14:46,174 --> 01:14:49,350
一旦失去控制，大家只有自求多福了
and we'll be lucky to live through it.

1136
01:14:51,689 --> 01:14:55,526
飞行甲板起火了，所有人员前来帮忙
Fire on the flight deck. All hands lend assistance.

1137
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:04,910
飞机有足够的燃料把你送到那里
The bird's loaded down with enough fuel to get you there,

1138
01:15:05,035 --> 01:15:06,704
但达拉斯号有可能不在那了
but Dallas may not be there.

1139
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:08,221
我们会试着通知它
We're trying to reach her.

1140
01:15:08,290 --> 01:15:10,540
但如深度太深他们还是收不到
If she's gone deep, it's dodgy.

1141
01:15:10,624 --> 01:15:12,918
如果你必须要迫降…
If you have to ditch...

1142
01:15:20,384 --> 01:15:21,886
如果你必须在海上迫降
If you have to ditch,

1143
01:15:21,969 --> 01:15:24,430
记得打开救生衣
don't think about anything but the survival gear.

1144
01:15:24,555 --> 01:15:28,100
在这种温度下，你只能撑四分钟
At this water's temperature, you'll have about four minutes.

1145
01:15:28,225 --> 01:15:30,269
我会尽量牢记
I'll try to remember that.

1146
01:15:32,938 --> 01:15:36,400
杰克，下次写一份该死的备忘录
Next time, Jack, write a goddamn memo.

1147
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,802
下潜深度650米
Diving officer, make your depth 6-5-0 feet.

1148
01:16:03,928 --> 01:16:05,554
深度650米
Make my depth 6-5-0 feet.

1149
01:16:05,638 --> 01:16:08,766
声纳连接隔热层下面的信号
Sonar, Conn preceding below the thermal layer.

1150
01:16:09,642 --> 01:16:11,894
- 船长睡觉了吧？  - 是的
- The captain's sacked out? - Yeah.

1151
01:16:11,970 --> 01:16:14,408
附加行进5,000磅
Auxiliaries proceed 5,000 pounds.

1152
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:15,940
他呢？
What about him?

1153
01:16:16,075 --> 01:16:17,164
他不会离开的
He won't leave.

1154
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:19,382
声纳，等等
Conn. Sonar, hold.

1155
01:16:19,454 --> 01:16:22,780
航道295没有潜艇踪迹
No contacts on bearing 2-9-5.

1156
01:16:27,660 --> 01:16:28,734
跟你说
You know,

1157
01:16:29,992 --> 01:16:31,660
有一次我看到美人鱼
I seen me a mermaid once.

1158
01:16:32,289 --> 01:16:36,085
我还看到鲨鱼吃章鱼的画面
I've even seen me a shark eat a octopus,

1159
01:16:36,168 --> 01:16:40,214
但我从未见过俄国幽灵潜艇
but I ain't never seen no phantom Russian submarine.

1160
01:17:19,044 --> 01:17:20,796
我们正驶出航道，船长
We're emerging from the route, Captain.

1161
01:17:20,879 --> 01:17:23,132
缓冲装置已经启动
I've ordered a routine clearing of the baffles.

1162
01:17:23,215 --> 01:17:26,927
几分钟后我们将进入第一个转弯
We'll be making the first turn in a few minutes.

1163
01:17:27,010 --> 01:17:29,024
履带推进器正在运转
The caterpillar is operational and...

1164
01:17:29,385 --> 01:17:31,180
看起来运转正常
appears to be running normally.

1165
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:34,226
船员们…
The crew...

1166
01:17:34,952 --> 01:17:36,310
知道了间谍的事
know about the saboteur.

1167
01:17:36,425 --> 01:17:37,890
他们都很害怕
They are afraid.

1168
01:17:40,190 --> 01:17:43,193
到时候这一点会很受用
That could be useful when the time comes.

1169
01:17:46,530 --> 01:17:51,035
我们将在16小时后到达拉布拉多海岸
You know, we could make the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

1170
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:54,709
在得到救援之前他们就会被先冻死
Half of them would freeze before they were rescued.

1171
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:58,141
不行，去麻萨诸塞或缅因州
No, it's Massachusetts or Maine...

1172
01:17:58,453 --> 01:17:59,580
48小时后
In 48 hours.

1173
01:18:00,544 --> 01:18:03,047
两天
Two days.

1174
01:18:09,553 --> 01:18:12,890
他们会让我住在蒙大拿吗？
Do you think they will let me live in Montana?

1175
01:18:21,774 --> 01:18:25,736
他们会让你住在任何你想要居住的地方
I would think they'll let you live wherever you want.

1176
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:27,341
好
Good.

1177
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,640
我就住在蒙大拿
Then I will live in Montana,

1178
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:33,642
我要娶一个丰满的美国女人
and I will marry a round American woman...

1179
01:18:33,738 --> 01:18:35,694
我还要养兔子
and raise rabbits,

1180
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:37,986
让她把兔子煮熟了给我吃
and she will cook them for me,

1181
01:18:39,545 --> 01:18:41,910
我还要买一台小卡车
and I will have a pickup truck.

1182
01:18:43,504 --> 01:18:45,172
或是…
Or a...

1183
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:50,969
可能是一辆野营旅游车…
Possibly even a recreational vehicle

1184
01:18:51,095 --> 01:18:53,430
开着它到各个州去兜风
and drive from state to state.

1185
01:18:55,474 --> 01:18:58,393
- 他们会让你那样做吗？  - 当然
- Do they let you do that? - Yes.

1186
01:18:58,470 --> 01:18:59,727
不用打报告？
No papers?

1187
01:19:00,568 --> 01:19:03,230
不需要，行动自由
No papers. State to state.

1188
01:19:03,315 --> 01:19:05,692
好，开始转向
All right. Commence your turn.

1189
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:10,646
那之后…
And then...

1190
01:19:11,338 --> 01:19:13,115
冬天我要住在…
in winter I will live in...

1191
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,110
亚历桑那州
Arizona.

1192
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:19,051
我觉得我应该娶两个老婆
Actually, I think I will need two wives.

1193
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:20,620
至少两个
At least.

1194
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,658
目标可能转向
Possible aspect change on target.

1195
01:19:34,293 --> 01:19:35,260
收到
Sonar, Conn. Aye.

1196
01:19:35,347 --> 01:19:38,517
同时方位变动率显示目标正在急转
Concur possible target zig based on bearing rate.

1197
01:19:41,812 --> 01:19:44,273
- 声纳！大回转  - 停止前进！保持安静
- Conn! Sonar! Crazy Ivan! - All stop! Quick quiet!

1198
01:19:44,356 --> 01:19:47,067
- 停止前进  - 引擎全部停止工作了
- All stop, aye. - Engine's all stopped.

1199
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:55,617
发生了什么事，琼斯？
What's going on, Jonesy?

1200
01:19:55,701 --> 01:19:57,828
俄国的船长有时会突然转向
Russian captains sometimes turn suddenly

1201
01:19:57,851 --> 01:19:59,829
来确认后面是否有人跟踪
to see if anyone's behind them.

1202
01:20:00,072 --> 01:20:02,490
我们称之为大回转
We call it Crazy Ivan.

1203
01:20:03,542 --> 01:20:05,085
你唯一能做的就是静止不动
The only thing you can do is go dead,

1204
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:06,420
关闭所有引擎
shut everything down,

1205
01:20:06,530 --> 01:20:08,957
在水底静止不动
and make like a hole in the water.

1206
01:20:09,210 --> 01:20:10,924
其中有什么蹊跷呢？
So what's the catch?

1207
01:20:11,216 --> 01:20:15,387
问题就是，像这么大的潜艇不可能立即刹住
Catch is a boat this big doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

1208
01:20:16,260 --> 01:20:19,145
如果我们太接近了，会从后面撞上它
If we're too close, we'll drift right into the back of him.

1209
01:20:23,520 --> 01:20:27,024
你呢？你是怎么打算的？
What about you? What do you look forward to?

1210
01:20:36,074 --> 01:20:37,201
我…
I...

1211
01:20:38,702 --> 01:20:41,872
我没有那些欲望
I have no such appetites.

1212
01:20:42,706 --> 01:20:45,542
看看他能否听到我们
Now, let's see if he can hear us.

1213
01:20:50,255 --> 01:20:53,217
你肯定有些想法的
There must be something.

1214
01:21:00,933 --> 01:21:03,060
是什么？
What is it?

1215
01:21:06,271 --> 01:21:10,317
我怀念小时候
I miss the peace of fishing

1216
01:21:11,109 --> 01:21:14,112
钓鱼的那种平静
like when I was a boy.

1217
01:21:16,281 --> 01:21:19,576
我在大海中生活了40年
Forty years I have been at sea.

1218
01:21:20,619 --> 01:21:23,622
钻研海上战术
A war at sea.

1219
01:21:24,831 --> 01:21:27,584
但没真正打过仗
A war with no battles.

1220
01:21:29,294 --> 01:21:31,421
没有丰碑
No monuments.

1221
01:21:32,756 --> 01:21:35,008
有的只是伤害
Only casualties.

1222
01:21:38,762 --> 01:21:42,766
在结婚的那天太太就成了活寡妇
I widowed her the day I married her.

1223
01:21:46,103 --> 01:21:49,481
连她死的时候，我都不在身边
My wife died while I was at sea, you know.

1224
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:10,794
安排哨兵在轮机室
Post guards in the engineering spaces.

1225
01:22:11,068 --> 01:22:12,392
如果那个人能介入履带推动器
If he can get to the caterpillar,

1226
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:15,540
他同样可以去到更要命的地方
he can get to somewhere more vital.

1227
01:22:19,052 --> 01:22:21,722
- 他现在在哪，琼斯？  - 声纳信号连接
- Where is he, Jonesy? - Conn, Sonar.

1228
01:22:21,805 --> 01:22:24,725
目标正驶离我们的右舷遮流板
Target is now coming out of our starboard baffles.

1229
01:22:24,808 --> 01:22:28,312
数据显示，他正回到底层
My read is that he is returning to base course.

1230
01:22:29,187 --> 01:22:31,940
他回到了210航线
Concur. He's returning to course 2-1-0.

1231
01:22:32,024 --> 01:22:34,484
他就在我们周围
He went right around us.

1232
01:22:35,310 --> 01:22:37,573
再给他30秒
We'll give him another 30 seconds,

1233
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,763
然后再进行监听
then secure from silent running.

1234
01:22:40,824 --> 01:22:42,326
舰长
Captain?

1235
01:22:43,035 --> 01:22:45,329
这是最新的信息
Here's what we got on the ELF.

1236
01:22:47,080 --> 01:22:48,999
- 谢谢  - 是，长官
- Thanks. - Aye, sir.

1237
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:58,884
这是什么？
What is it?

1238
01:23:00,719 --> 01:23:03,513
难以置信
You're not going to believe this.

1239
01:23:16,193 --> 01:23:18,153
长官，我们即将到达返航地点
Commander, we are approaching no return.

1240
01:23:18,236 --> 01:23:20,113
达拉斯号显然没有接到信息
Dallas apparently hasn't gotten the message.

1241
01:23:20,190 --> 01:23:22,053
我们必须折返
We have to turn back for the carrier.

1242
01:23:22,235 --> 01:23:23,450
再等它一会儿
Give it a couple more minutes.

1243
01:23:23,533 --> 01:23:25,827
不行，油表已经显示油料不足
Negative. Fuel status says we turn around now.

1244
01:23:25,911 --> 01:23:28,997
等等，你不是应该有备用燃料吗？
Fuel status? You got a reserve, don't you?

1245
01:23:29,081 --> 01:23:31,249
我的备用燃料只够十分钟
I've got a 10-minute reserve,

1246
01:23:31,375 --> 01:23:33,835
可我不能用那些燃料，除了开战
but I'm not allowed to invade that except during war.

1247
01:23:33,919 --> 01:23:37,506
如果你不把我送到潜艇，那就开战了
If you don't get me on that submarine, you might have it.

1248
01:23:37,589 --> 01:23:39,839
给你十分钟的燃料
You got 10 minutes worth of fuel.

1249
01:23:39,923 --> 01:23:41,900
我们在这里再等十分钟
We stay here 10 more minutes.

1250
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:50,439
上升！三点钟方向有潜艇
Mount up! I got a submarine at around 3:00.

1251
01:23:50,502 --> 01:23:52,040
距离大概有两英哩
About 2 miles.

1252
01:23:54,272 --> 01:23:55,607
好，托尼，把他吊下去
Okay, Tony, hook him up.

1253
01:23:55,732 --> 01:23:59,194
我现在把你放到潜艇那去
I'll be lowering you down to the submarine now.

1254
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:00,922
给你八分钟时间
Give me eight minutes.

1255
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:04,030
希望飞机可以在烟气上飞行
Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

1256
01:24:04,110 --> 01:24:05,780
很好，把潜艇浮到水面上去
Very well. Surface the ship.

1257
01:24:05,884 --> 01:24:07,160
浮上水面，长官
Surface the ship. Aye, sir.

1258
01:24:07,244 --> 01:24:09,913
不管这个人是谁，胆子真大
Whoever this guy is, he's in for one hell of a ride.

1259
01:24:09,996 --> 01:24:12,749
长官，往前点，坐下
Okay, Commander, go ahead and sit down.

1260
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:15,586
你以前这样做过吗？
You ever do this before?

1261
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:18,580
在夏威夷，但当时风平浪静
Once. On a calm day off Hawaii.

1262
01:24:18,670 --> 01:24:22,268
没有参照点，飞行员会停下来一段时间
The pilot will have a difficult time keeping steady.

1263
01:24:22,509 --> 01:24:25,720
小心雷击 把棒子拿在你身前
Don't take chances getting grounded. Keep that rod in front of you.

1264
01:24:25,804 --> 01:24:26,888
在这样的天气里
In air like this,

1265
01:24:26,972 --> 01:24:28,557
旋翼会释放出很多静电
the rotors will put out enough static electricity

1266
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,850
可以点亮整个芝加哥
to light up Chicago.

1267
01:24:29,933 --> 01:24:31,184
那就是我加入海军的原因
That's why I joined the Navy.

1268
01:24:31,268 --> 01:24:35,063
救生舱有一名潜水员待命，以防他掉进大海
A diver's in the escape trunk in case this guy goes in the drink.

1269
01:24:35,283 --> 01:24:37,291
这人一定是疯了
Someone must have a burr up his ass

1270
01:24:37,377 --> 01:24:39,480
才会做出这样惊险的举动
to go for a stunt like this.

1271
01:24:58,044 --> 01:25:01,131
好，准备！弄好你的h子
All right. Ready! Ready! Get your hook up!

1272
01:25:03,633 --> 01:25:06,428
长官，如果我想要把你拉起来
Commander, if I got to bring you back up,

1273
01:25:06,511 --> 01:25:09,347
我就晃动绳索，像这样给你一个大拇指
I'm going to shake the wire. I'll give you a thumbs up, like this.

1274
01:25:10,682 --> 01:25:14,102
双臂交叉，明白了吗？出去吧
Remember to cross your arms. Got it? Okay. Out you go.

1275
01:25:14,186 --> 01:25:16,563
乘客出了舱门
Passenger's out the door.

1276
01:25:23,069 --> 01:25:26,865
乘客正在下降，向前行驶
Passenger's halfway down, drifting forward. Start forward.

1277
01:25:31,161 --> 01:25:34,206
汤米，把钩子钩到他的绳索上
All right, Tommy. Get the hook on his cable.

1278
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:36,701
小心点
On his cable. Now, watch it.

1279
01:25:36,988 --> 01:25:39,500
别碰他，他过来了
Don't touch him. Okay, here he comes.

1280
01:25:44,674 --> 01:25:45,634
不
No!

1281
01:25:45,717 --> 01:25:48,637
风势太强了
It would be easier without that bloody crosswind.

1282
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,014
他去哪了？我看不到他了
Where is he? I can't see him.

1283
01:25:52,224 --> 01:25:54,059
别碰他
Don't touch him!

1284
01:25:55,060 --> 01:25:57,729
杰克！杰克！杰克！
Jack! Jack! Jack!

1285
01:25:59,770 --> 01:26:01,090
这样不行
This is never going to work.

1286
01:26:01,159 --> 01:26:03,159
把他拉回来
Okay, reel him back in.

1287
01:26:11,243 --> 01:26:14,204
托尼，后面的情况如何…
Tony, what's going on back...

1288
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:20,335
什么情况？达拉斯号，你们有救生人员吗？
What happened? Dallas, have you got a swimmer standing?

1289
01:26:20,410 --> 01:26:21,981
紧急状况，有人落水了！
Emergency stop! Man overboard!

1290
01:26:22,075 --> 01:26:24,502
左舷！派出潜水员
Port side! Send out the diver!

1291
01:26:25,215 --> 01:26:27,884
达拉斯号，我们必须返航
Very well, Dallas. We are history.

1292
01:26:36,726 --> 01:26:40,313
快叫医生下来！我会在逃生舱
Get the doc down here! I'll be in the escape trunk.

1293
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:47,279
下梯！让开
Down ladder! Down ladder! Make a hole!

1294
01:26:50,610 --> 01:26:53,277
注意他的头，注意他的头
Watch his head. Watch his head.

1295
01:27:03,790 --> 01:27:05,178
你好吗，舰长？
How do you do, Captain?

1296
01:27:05,956 --> 01:27:08,100
很荣幸登上了潜艇
It's a pleasure to be aboard.

1297
01:27:10,468 --> 01:27:12,971
我必须和总统谈谈
I have to talk to the President.

1298
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:15,460
当然
Of course.

1299
01:27:15,973 --> 01:27:18,100
我能问一下你想谈什么吗？
May I inquire as to the subject?

1300
01:27:19,853 --> 01:27:23,732
先前那份报告称我们的一艘潜艇丢了
It seems that the initial reports that one of our submarines was missing

1301
01:27:23,815 --> 01:27:26,526
那个消息并不完全正确
were not completely accurate.

1302
01:27:28,486 --> 01:27:30,739
那艘有问题的潜艇
The submarine in question

1303
01:27:30,822 --> 01:27:34,743
是由马可・雷米思舰长所指挥
is commanded by Captain Marko Ramius.

1304
01:27:34,820 --> 01:27:37,200
很显然，他的精神状况…
Apparently, he has suffered a kind of...

1305
01:27:37,542 --> 01:27:39,280
出了些问题
mental or nervous breakdown.

1306
01:27:40,957 --> 01:27:43,335
在他起航之前
Just before he sailed,

1307
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:47,130
他寄了封信给尤里・帕多林将军
he posted a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin

1308
01:27:47,213 --> 01:27:50,675
他在信中宣称他打算…
in which he announced his intention to...

1309
01:27:52,510 --> 01:27:55,805
向美国发射导弹
To fire his missiles on the United States.

1310
01:27:57,057 --> 01:27:59,017
你上次怎么没告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met?

1311
01:27:59,142 --> 01:28:01,227
以我的地位来说
In my position I'm sometimes compromised

1312
01:28:01,311 --> 01:28:04,898
莫斯科方面不会把什么情况都告诉我
by the fact Moscow doesn't always tell me everything.

1313
01:28:04,981 --> 01:28:08,276
所以说是你们的一位舰长精神错乱了？
So one of your submarine captains has gone insane?

1314
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,584
你要我们怎么做？
What do you want from us?

1315
01:28:09,727 --> 01:28:11,297
需要贵国的援助
You offered your assistance.

1316
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:13,615
本来是营救任务
That was a rescue mission.

1317
01:28:13,690 --> 01:28:16,469
现在你是希望我们找到他并杀死他
Now you want us to help you hunt him down and kill him.

1318
01:28:18,031 --> 01:28:22,105
我正是因这件事被指派来询问你们的总统
I have been instructed to ask your president for precisely that.

1319
01:28:23,330 --> 01:28:24,963
找他？我们已经发现他了
Find him? We already found him.

1320
01:28:25,043 --> 01:28:27,210
为弄你上来我们不得不停下
We had to break off to pick you up.

1321
01:28:27,337 --> 01:28:30,090
- 舰长打断一下，咖啡？  - 谢谢
- Captain, excuse me. Coffee? - Thank you.

1322
01:28:30,173 --> 01:28:32,342
- 来根烟吗？  - 我不吸烟
- Cigarette? - Don't smoke.

1323
01:28:32,926 --> 01:28:35,637
假设我们找到他了
Assuming we can find him,

1324
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,722
我们到底该怎么做？
just what exactly am I supposed to do about it?

1325
01:28:37,847 --> 01:28:39,140
舰长
Captain, radio.

1326
01:28:39,224 --> 01:28:42,143
通讯室收到一封紧急电报
We're receiving flash traffic on the VLF emergency circuit.

1327
01:28:42,227 --> 01:28:45,063
很好，把它弄下来
Very well. Bring it down.

1328
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:48,525
说吧，莱恩先生？
Mr. Ryan?

1329
01:28:51,020 --> 01:28:53,087
长官，你们先出去一下
Chief, excuse us for a second.

1330
01:28:53,319 --> 01:28:54,877
莱奥，出去吧
Leonard, come on out of there.

1331
01:29:01,579 --> 01:29:04,833
我们跟踪的潜艇叫做红色十月
The sub we're after is called the Red October.

1332
01:29:04,916 --> 01:29:07,210
是由一个叫雷米思的人指挥的
She's under the command of a man named Ramius.

1333
01:29:07,290 --> 01:29:09,071
现在有可能他…
Now, there's the possibility that he...

1334
01:29:09,173 --> 01:29:12,488
和大部分船员打算叛变
and a good portion of his crew are attempting to defect.

1335
01:29:15,593 --> 01:29:17,262
叛变？
Defect?

1336
01:29:18,555 --> 01:29:20,223
失陪一下
Excuse me.

1337
01:29:37,407 --> 01:29:39,492
你说那艘潜艇是红色十月号？
You say the boat's called the Red October?

1338
01:29:39,576 --> 01:29:41,661
- 对  - 舰长叫雷米思？
- That's right. - Skipper's Ramius?

1339
01:29:41,745 --> 01:29:43,496
对
Right.

1340
01:29:43,580 --> 01:29:47,667
情况似乎有变化，莱恩先生
It seems the circumstances have changed somewhat, Mr. Ryan.

1341
01:29:54,924 --> 01:29:56,176
给这个人拿些干衣服来
Get this man some dry clothes.

1342
01:29:56,259 --> 01:29:59,179
- 我在指挥舱  - 是，长官
- I'll be in the conn. - Aye, aye, sir.

1343
01:30:00,013 --> 01:30:01,097
“国家指挥中心”

“你有权使用任何必须的力量”

“阻止这艘潜艇”

Left 10 degrees rudder secure course of 2-6-5.

1352

航速14节
Make turns for 14 knots.

1353
01:30:38,343 --> 01:30:41,387
监察官，保持警戒
Chief of the watch, rig for red.

1354
01:30:44,682 --> 01:30:48,394
舵手和引航员到指挥舱甲板上去
Time Quartermasters and Navigator on the deck in the conn.

1355
01:30:51,648 --> 01:30:52,774
什么事？
What's going on?

1356
01:30:52,850 --> 01:30:54,370
战位准备就绪
Battle stations are manned and ready.

1357
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,882
很好
Very well.

1358
01:30:56,653 --> 01:30:59,364
- 舰长，我必须要跟你谈谈  - 现在不行
- Captain, I have to talk to you. - Not now.

1359

Make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down angle.

1360
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:05,440
潜水官，深度到达1200英尺

1361
01:31:05,517 --> 01:31:07,490
向下20度

1362
01:31:09,165 --> 01:31:12,460

1364
01:31:17,257 --> 01:31:20,552
过了450英尺，正下潜到1200英尺
Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

1368
01:31:35,400 --> 01:31:37,068
准备好了吗？
Did you get a good fix?

1369
01:31:37,193 --> 01:31:38,528
- 是的，舰长  - 很好

01:31:38,611 --> 01:31:40,905
到达指定深度，1200英尺

1371
01:31:46,110 --> 01:31:47,327
声纳
Sonar, Conn.

1372
01:31:47,581 --> 01:31:48,831
你听到他了吗，琼斯？
You got him, yet, Jonesy?

1373
01:31:48,980 --> 01:31:50,588
很微弱，等一下
Very faint, sir. Hold on.

1374
01:31:52,458 --> 01:31:55,712
是的长官，在250方位联系到了台风七号
Yes, sir. Contact Typhoon 7 on bearing 2-5-0.

1375
01:31:55,795 --> 01:31:57,171
他就在我们预想的位置
Right where he's supposed to be.

1376
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:58,949
他察觉到我们的存在了吗？
Any sign he's alerted to our presence?

1377
01:31:59,156 --> 01:32:01,082
没有，还是像以前一样运行

1378
01:32:02,300 --> 01:32:03,959
到265航线左边
Come left 2-6-5.

1379
01:32:04,196 --> 01:32:06,108
悄悄跟上他，汤米

1380
01:32:06,182 --> 01:32:07,050
是，船长
Aye, aye, Captain.

1381
01:32:07,140 --> 01:32:10,226
潜水指挥官，深度到达500英尺
Diving Officer, make your depth 500 feet.

1382
01:32:19,230 --> 01:32:21,851
船长，请听我说，两分钟就足够了
Captain, please listen to me. Two minutes, that's all.

1383
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,488
绘图员，还有多久可截获他
Plot, time to intercept his track.

1384
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,280
四分钟，船长
Four minutes, Captain.

1385
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:31,956
很好，莱恩先生，两分钟
Very well, Mr. Ryan. Two minutes.

1386
01:32:38,630 --> 01:32:41,049
我知道你被授命攻击这很合理
It makes perfect sense.

1387
01:32:41,132 --> 01:32:44,302
看看当前的形势，雷米思想要叛变
Look at the situation, Ramius intends to defect.

1388
01:32:44,427 --> 01:32:47,388
俄国人知道这点，因此他们想击沉他
The Russians know this, which is why they've tried to sink him,

1389
01:32:47,472 --> 01:32:49,599
但是他们不能…
but they haven't been able to...

1390
01:32:49,682 --> 01:32:51,392
- 我想出一套攻击方案  - 很好
- I have a firing solution. - Very well.

1391
01:32:51,476 --> 01:32:53,561
舰长，你必须要听我说
Captain, you have to listen to me.

1392
01:32:53,645 --> 01:32:56,564
俄国人不能阻止雷米思叛变
The Russians will stop at nothing to prevent Ramius from defecting.

1393
01:32:56,648 --> 01:32:58,775
他们编造故事说他疯了
They've invented this story that he's crazy

1394
01:32:58,858 --> 01:33:02,695
是因为他们需要我们的帮助消灭他
because they need us to sink him before he can contact us.

1395
01:33:04,690 --> 01:33:06,792
检查武器，要保证绝对安全
Weapons Control, I want full safeties.

1396
01:33:06,888 --> 01:33:09,110
我不想放掉这条大鱼
I don't want this fish coming back.

1397
01:33:09,200 --> 01:33:10,210
是的，长官
Full safety.

1398
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:12,312
舰长，我了解他
Captain, I know this man.

1399
01:33:14,620 --> 01:33:16,367
他有没有再做出大回转？
Has he made any Crazy Ivans?

1400
01:33:16,831 --> 01:33:18,040
那有什么不同吗？
What difference does that make?

1401
01:33:18,127 --> 01:33:20,546
- 他下一步会向右转  - 因为他上次是向左转？
- The next one will be to starboard. - Why? Because his last was to port?

1402
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:23,680
因为他习惯后半段右转
Because he goes to starboard in the bottom half of the hour.

1403
01:33:28,680 --> 01:33:31,349
一号二号鱼雷管准备发射
Flood tubes one and two. Warm up the weapons.

1404
01:33:31,474 --> 01:33:34,644
肯定有办法在不违反规定的情况下和他取得联系
Find a way to establish contact without violating orders.

1405
01:33:34,727 --> 01:33:36,479
我跟你说，他要叛变
He wants to defect!

1406
01:33:36,560 --> 01:33:37,484
汤普森先生
Mr. Thompson,

1407
01:33:37,578 --> 01:33:40,362
让华生长官带武器到指挥舱来
call Chief Watson to the conn with his sidearm.

1408
01:33:45,154 --> 01:33:48,074
指挥舱，这里是声纳室，信噪比在下降
Conn, Sonar. Signal to noise ratio's dropping.

1409
01:33:48,157 --> 01:33:49,784
目标可能改变了方向

1410
01:33:49,867 --> 01:33:52,996
目标正在转向

舰长，他转向了
Captain, he's turning.

1414
01:34:07,677 --> 01:34:11,055
- 向哪个方向？  - 向右，长官
- Which way is he turning? - To the starboard, sir.

1415
01:34:12,515 --> 01:34:15,518
给他一次机会吧
Give the man a chance.

1416
01:34:17,103 --> 01:34:18,896
全速后退
All back full.

1417
01:34:19,397 --> 01:34:21,441
- 舰长，再说一遍  - 我说全速后退
- Captain, say again. - I said all back full!

1418
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,639
- 全速后退  - 引擎全速后退
Back full. Aye, sir. Engines back full.

1419
01:34:28,531 --> 01:34:30,658
他们能听到我们
We're cavitating. He can hear us!

1420
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:31,917
静止不动
Conn, aye.

1421
01:34:32,530 --> 01:34:33,515
静止
All stop.

1422

是
All stop, aye.

1423
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:37,509
我们暴露了行踪
All right. We just unzipped our fly.

1424
01:34:37,746 --> 01:34:39,145
汤普森先生
Mr. Thompson,

1425
01:34:39,581 --> 01:34:40,756

1428
01:34:44,964 --> 01:34:47,175
我就把他打到火星上去

船腹部舵手停止运行

1430
01:34:50,210 --> 01:34:51,540

1431
01:34:51,647 --> 01:34:53,330
你能辨别来者吗？
Can you identify the contact?

1432
01:34:54,057 --> 01:34:57,435
是一艘洛杉矶级美国攻击潜艇，方位015…

1433
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,645
船长，有尖锐的金属撞击声

1434
01:34:59,729 --> 01:35:02,648
他可能要开启鱼雷管

01:35:31,594 --> 01:35:34,847
将发射指令改由电脑控制

不要打开外舱门

1450
01:35:56,280 --> 01:35:58,031
没有船长，它只是停在那里

01:36:08,131 --> 01:36:11,425
那意味着你的俄国朋友很聪明

他知道我们在这里

他并没有要挑衅我们

01:36:14,971 --> 01:36:17,265
他要上升到了望深度，看水面上的情况

你想要说什么？
What do you want to say?

1479
01:37:35,210 --> 01:37:37,084
只有他单独使用潜望镜吗？
Is he the only one looking?

1480
01:37:37,504 --> 01:37:38,420
可能吧
Probably.

1481
01:37:39,388 --> 01:37:41,641

1488
01:37:58,950 --> 01:38:01,702
他看得懂密码吗？

1489
01:38:01,786 --> 01:38:05,248
问题是他想不想？
Yeah, he can. The question is, will he?

1490
01:38:13,142 --> 01:38:15,355
回应对方
Verify our range to target.

1491
01:38:16,342 --> 01:38:18,088
只打一下闪光
One ping only.

01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:29,807
我会受到谴责的
I'll be damned.

1494
01:38:30,604 --> 01:38:32,020
现在要说什么？
Now what?

1495
01:38:33,943 --> 01:38:35,569
好吧
All right.

1496
01:38:35,653 --> 01:38:38,322
“如果要投诚…”
"If defection...

1497
01:38:41,450 --> 01:38:44,066
“你就把航线朝向…”
"you plot course toward..."

1498
01:38:44,574 --> 01:38:45,990
图表
The chart.

1499
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,117
我需要一份图表
I need a chart.

1500
01:38:49,261 --> 01:38:51,460
不是这个
No. No.

1501
01:38:51,540 --> 01:38:53,247
我们现在到底在哪？
Okay. Where the hell are we?

1502
01:38:53,642 --> 01:38:56,028
下面某地，下面某地
Someplace deep. Someplace deep.

1503
01:38:57,549 --> 01:38:58,509
（劳伦系深水区）

1504
01:39:00,386 --> 01:39:02,847
把这个发给他！
Send them this!

1505
01:39:05,641 --> 01:39:07,197
就发吧
Just send it.
你疯了吗？
You out of your mind?

1506
01:39:07,197 --> 01:39:08,853
就发吧
Just send it.

1507
01:39:13,190 --> 01:39:15,026
告诉我一件事
Tell me one thing.

1508
01:39:15,151 --> 01:39:18,279
你是怎么知道他那时要向右转？
How did you know he was going to go to starboard?

1509
01:39:18,362 --> 01:39:19,864
我不知道
I didn't.

1510
01:39:20,860 --> 01:39:23,010
我有一半的机会说服你，我必须冒险
I had a 50/50 chance. I needed a break.

1511
01:39:23,123 --> 01:39:24,133
对不起
Sorry.

1512
01:39:25,820 --> 01:39:27,672
那好吧，莱恩先生
That's all right, Mr. Ryan.

1513
01:39:28,160 --> 01:39:29,410
我对摩斯码不太熟悉
My Morse is so rusty

1514
01:39:29,498 --> 01:39:33,044
我可能会耗费一个月的时间来向我们的玩伴发送消息
I may be sending dimensions on playmate of the month.

1515
01:39:52,563 --> 01:39:55,232
核实我们与目标的距离
Reverify our range to target.

1516
01:39:56,560 --> 01:39:58,116
回应他一次闪光
One ping only.

1517
01:39:58,695 --> 01:40:00,102
舰长，我…
Captain, I just...

1518
01:40:00,751 --> 01:40:02,218
发出一个信号，瓦西里
Give me a ping, Vasily.

1519
01:40:02,877 --> 01:40:04,610
请发送一个信号
One ping only, please.

1520
01:40:08,120 --> 01:40:09,872
是，舰长
Aye, Captain.

1521
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:16,545
这是什么意思？
What the hell is this about?

1522
01:40:17,691 --> 01:40:19,504
俄国人想让我们击沉它
The Russians want us to sink her.

1523
01:40:20,905 --> 01:40:22,808
我们可能必须要那样做
We might have to do that.

1524
01:40:31,060 --> 01:40:35,147
我们必须给美国人腾些地方
We must give this American a wide berth.

1525
01:40:36,232 --> 01:40:38,734
我们向南走
Let us turn south.

1526
01:40:48,452 --> 01:40:50,287
卡玛若夫先生…
Mr. Kamarov.

1527
01:40:52,410 --> 01:40:54,825
绘出一条向南的新航线
Plot a new course due south.

1528
01:40:55,407 --> 01:40:56,080
是，长官
Yes, sir.

1529
01:40:56,794 --> 01:40:59,422
新航线180
New course 1-8-0.

1530
01:41:23,695 --> 01:41:27,199
（大浅滩  位于劳伦系深水区北部）

1531
01:41:27,366 --> 01:41:28,367
（20小时后）

1532
01:41:31,954 --> 01:41:34,999
是反应炉，关闭反应炉
It's the reactor! Shut down the reactor!

1533
01:41:37,500 --> 01:41:39,109
关闭通风系统
Seal the ventilation system!

1534
01:41:39,189 --> 01:41:41,790
通风系统的控制器坏了！
The ventilation controls have failed!

1535
01:41:41,881 --> 01:41:45,176
大家快从舱房出来
Everybody out. Clear the compartment!

1536
01:41:46,010 --> 01:41:47,803
出来！
Out!

1537
01:41:56,812 --> 01:41:58,772
通风系统马上关闭
Ventilation system, shut it down now.

1538
01:41:58,856 --> 01:42:01,734
他们没有回应，控制器没有反应
They don't respond. The controls don't respond!

1539
01:42:01,817 --> 01:42:05,237
手动关闭它，快点！关上它
Bypass it. Seal it manually! Move! Shut it off.

1540
01:42:06,489 --> 01:42:08,574
麦勒金，再说一遍
Melekhin, say again.

1541
01:42:16,373 --> 01:42:18,542
由于冷却系统发生泄漏
Suffered a leak in the primary coolant tube,

1542
01:42:18,667 --> 01:42:20,085
反应炉已经关闭
so shut down the reactor,

1543
01:42:20,169 --> 01:42:23,172
但是通风系统坏了
but the ventilation circuits have been disabled.

1544
01:42:23,255 --> 01:42:25,174
冷却系统好像被严重污染了
The coolant appears highly contaminated.

1545
01:42:25,257 --> 01:42:27,635
我就知道履带推进器出问题了
I knew there was damage when the caterpillar went down.

1546
01:42:27,718 --> 01:42:30,471
正在向各个舱房发出辐射警报
Radiation alarms activating in all compartments.

1547
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:32,282
引擎受到了严重的污染
Engineering is heavily contaminated,

1548
01:42:32,337 --> 01:42:33,962
辐射正在袭来
and radiation's moving forward.

1549
01:42:34,225 --> 01:42:36,810
去到潜望深度，与外面的空气流通一下
Get to periscope depth. Ventilate with outside air.

1550
01:42:36,894 --> 01:42:38,646
是，船长，到达潜望深度
Aye, Captain. Periscope depth!

1551
01:42:38,729 --> 01:42:41,190
- 准备通风  - 通风不会有什么作用
- Prepare to ventilate! - Ventilating won't do anything.

1552
01:42:41,270 --> 01:42:42,806
我们必须疏散他们
We've got to get them off.

1553
01:42:42,980 --> 01:42:44,310
电池的电量还有多少？
What's the battery condition?

1554
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:46,977
四小时，省一点可以用六小时
Four hours. Six, if we're cautious.

1555
01:42:47,140 --> 01:42:48,395
启用电池系统
Engage battery system.

1556
01:42:48,572 --> 01:42:50,824
我们遭到了一级辐射泄漏
We've got a level one radiation leak.

1557
01:42:50,908 --> 01:42:52,701
潜艇的各个角落都被污染了
Every surface of this ship's contaminated.

1558
01:42:52,785 --> 01:42:55,704
只是通风不会起到任何作用，我们必须离开潜艇
We've got to get the men off.

1559
01:42:56,372 --> 01:42:59,500
长官，我们被人蓄意破坏了
Sir, we have been sabotaged!

1560
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:01,625
谁说的？
Who said anything about sabotage?

1561
01:43:01,997 --> 01:43:03,080
舰长
Captain!

1562
01:43:03,212 --> 01:43:06,549
长官，医生是对的
Sir, I'm afraid the doctor is right.

1563
01:43:11,637 --> 01:43:13,055
很好
Very well.

1564
01:43:13,138 --> 01:43:16,600
到水面上去，我们要把人员疏散到甲板上
Surface. We'll evacuate the men to the deck.

1565
01:43:16,725 --> 01:43:19,353
是，船长，使潜艇浮出水面
Aye, Captain. Surface the ship!

1566
01:43:19,436 --> 01:43:21,855
召集所有人员到逃生舱口
Prepare to muster all personnel to escape hatches.

1567
01:43:21,939 --> 01:43:25,150
拿出所有的救生艇，把它们放到甲板上
Break out the rafts. Lash them to the deck.

1568
01:43:25,234 --> 01:43:28,904
在舰队到来之前，救生艇将会是我们的避难所
We'll use them as shelters until the fleet arrives.

1569
01:44:11,322 --> 01:44:13,616
务必确定所有船员确实疏散
Make sure the count is accurate, Doctor.

1570
01:44:13,690 --> 01:44:15,531
我们必须让所有人都逃出去
We must get the entire crew out.

1571
01:44:15,655 --> 01:44:16,706
是，长官

1572
01:44:17,272 --> 01:44:21,057
卫兵士官报告说救生艇很安全，正在进行疏散
Master-at-arms reports rafts secure and evacuation proceeding.

1573
01:44:21,540 --> 01:44:23,042
很好
Very good.

1574
01:44:29,506 --> 01:44:31,759
我们轮流去指挥舱
We'll rotate through the conn.

1575
01:44:31,842 --> 01:44:35,512
不要让任何人停留超过20分钟的时间
No officer will spend more than 20 minutes below deck.

1576
01:44:35,638 --> 01:44:37,514
- 那样行吗？  - 可以，舰长
- Will that be satisfactory? - Completely, Captain.

1577
01:44:37,640 --> 01:44:38,764
水面信号

1578
01:44:39,426 --> 01:44:40,712
方位270

1579
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:43,390
距离六英哩并迅速接近中

1580
01:44:43,890 --> 01:44:45,076
是一艘军舰
It's a warship.

1581
01:44:45,360 --> 01:44:47,600
什么？你确定吗？

1582
01:44:47,690 --> 01:44:49,029
是一艘护卫舰
It's a frigate,

1583
01:44:49,457 --> 01:44:50,844
可能是美国的
U.S., probably,

1584
01:44:51,065 --> 01:44:52,650
佩里级，他正在发出信号

1585
01:44:53,820 --> 01:44:56,902
“红色十月号，红色十月号”

1586
01:44:57,708 --> 01:44:59,320
“别动，待在原地”

1587
01:44:59,471 --> 01:45:02,927
“勿试图潜入水中，以免遭到攻击”
"Do not attempt to submerge, or you will be fired upon."

1588
01:45:05,910 --> 01:45:08,373
舰长，我觉得他是想让我们登船
Captain, I think he means to board us.

1589
01:45:14,885 --> 01:45:17,012
你和船员们去
You will go with the crew.

1590
01:45:17,096 --> 01:45:20,474
我和指挥官们将会潜入你们下方
The officers and I will submerge beneath you

1591
01:45:20,557 --> 01:45:23,060
追赶这艘舰艇
and scuttle the ship.

1592
01:45:23,185 --> 01:45:26,939
你会因此得到列宁勋章的，舰长
You'll receive the Order of Lenin for this, Captain.

1593
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:37,542
我们离开

01:45:38,535 --> 01:45:40,700
舰长要击沉这艘舰艇
The captain's going to scuttle the ship.

1595
01:45:46,417 --> 01:45:47,751
他正在下潜，长官
He's going down, sir.

1596
01:45:47,876 --> 01:45:51,130
向他的船头方向射击，向右到达180航线
Put a shot across his bow. Come right at 1-8-0.

1597
01:46:22,494 --> 01:46:25,956
海鹰一号，起飞
Seahawk One, this is bravo command.

1598
01:46:42,973 --> 01:46:44,641
她准备好了
She's ready.

1599
01:46:46,268 --> 01:46:48,520
海鹰一号，立刻发射鱼雷

1600
01:46:48,604 --> 01:46:51,940
投射、投射

300码

1608
01:47:29,978 --> 01:47:32,356
鱼雷被引爆了

1609
01:47:33,020 --> 01:47:33,862
现在
Now,

1610
01:47:34,431 --> 01:47:35,664
我明白，指挥官
understand, Commander,

1611
01:47:35,945 --> 01:47:37,900
鱼雷不是自己引爆的
that torpedo did not self-destruct.

1612
01:47:38,033 --> 01:47:39,548
你听到它击中了船体

1613
01:47:39,655 --> 01:47:42,320
而我从来没有出现在这里
And I was never here.

1614
01:47:43,867 --> 01:47:46,286
联系达拉斯号，让他们出发
Contact Dallas. Give them the go.

1615
01:47:46,370 --> 01:47:48,872
通知达拉斯号，让深潜救助艇行动
Advise Dallas. Get the DSRV moving.

1616
01:47:48,997 --> 01:47:50,415
达拉斯号，我是鲁本吉姆斯
Dallas, this is Rueben James.

1617
01:47:57,339 --> 01:47:58,674
这么惊险的行动
There are about two million things

1618
01:47:59,049 --> 01:48:01,301
随时都可能出问题

1619

中央情报局

1620
01:48:04,160 --> 01:48:06,550
这里明显是有矛盾
Now, there's a contradiction in terms.

1621
01:48:08,517 --> 01:48:11,311
来杯咖啡怎么样，莱恩？
How's the coffee, Ryan?

1622
01:48:11,395 --> 01:48:14,314
达拉斯号，这里是神秘号，请求起航
Dallas, this is the Mystic. Request clearance for launch.

1623
01:48:14,390 --> 01:48:16,982

1626
01:48:23,073 --> 01:48:24,950

1627
01:48:25,033 --> 01:48:27,119
- 准备入水  - 准备入水

注水完成并保持平衡

1630
01:48:31,748 --> 01:48:34,418
来吧
Okay. Let's do it.

1631
01:48:35,711 --> 01:48:37,546
我们出发了
We're off.

1632
01:48:37,921 --> 01:48:40,215
拥有强大推动力的港口
Thrusting port.

1633
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:02,193
距离600码并持续接近
Six hundred yards and closing.

1634
01:49:02,450 --> 01:49:04,650
沿着075航线行驶
Steer right to course 0-7-5.

1635
01:49:05,407 --> 01:49:06,783
400码
Four hundred.

1636
01:49:10,996 --> 01:49:13,415
200码
Two hundred yards.

1637
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:17,002
100码
One hundred yards.

1638
01:49:23,800 --> 01:49:25,969
把灯打开
Hit the lights.

1639
01:49:39,311 --> 01:49:41,380
天啊，是个大家伙
Jesus, that's a big sucker.

1640
01:49:58,011 --> 01:49:59,750
好了，我们已经到位了
Okay, we're in position.

1641
01:49:59,967 --> 01:50:02,290
你可以打开舱门了
You can open the hatch.

1642
01:50:02,965 --> 01:50:05,300
等一下，琼斯
Hold it a second. Jonesy.

1643
01:50:07,803 --> 01:50:09,638
莱恩先生
Mr. Ryan.

1644
01:50:12,557 --> 01:50:14,810
他是要叛变
He's defecting.

1645
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:16,803
他不会改主意吗？
And he can't change his mind?

1646
01:50:17,680 --> 01:50:19,694
他不会改变主意的
He's not going to change his mind.

1647
01:50:20,190 --> 01:50:23,318
你要把命赌在那上面吗？
You willing to bet your life on that?

1648
01:50:42,879 --> 01:50:45,882
- 长官，能把锤子递给我吗？  - 好
- Sir, could you hand me that hammer? - Yeah.

1649
01:51:08,572 --> 01:51:10,240
美国人
Americans.

1650
01:52:54,136 --> 01:52:55,679
他的脸都吓绿了
He's turning green.

1651
01:53:18,535 --> 01:53:20,662
你笑什么？
What's so funny?

1652
01:53:22,164 --> 01:53:26,001
我们舰长以为你是像牛仔一样的人
The captain seems to think you're some sort of cowboy.

1653
01:53:27,335 --> 01:53:28,712
你会说俄语
You speak Russian.

1654
01:53:30,422 --> 01:53:32,382
会一点
A little.

1655
01:53:34,050 --> 01:53:37,512
学习敌人的说话方式是很明智的行为
It's wise to study the ways of one's adversary.

1656
01:53:37,596 --> 01:53:39,389
你不这样认为吗？
Don't you think?

1657
01:53:40,557 --> 01:53:42,184
确实是
It is.

1658
01:53:44,394 --> 01:53:45,478
我怀疑你是否还记得
I doubt you'd remember,

1659
01:53:45,562 --> 01:53:49,441
我们曾在列宁格勒的领事馆见过一面
but we met once at the Consulate in Leningrad.

1660
01:53:49,524 --> 01:53:52,402
还有你的妻子，非常抱歉
Along with your wife. I'm very sorry.

1661
01:53:55,405 --> 01:53:59,201
你凭什么向我的潜艇开炮？
What gives you the right to fire on my ship?

1662
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:02,767
你们的信息并没有提到鱼雷
Your signal said nothing of a torpedo.

1663
01:54:03,186 --> 01:54:03,950
莱恩
Ryan.

1664
01:54:05,874 --> 01:54:09,252
有必要给你的船员制造一个假象
It was necessary to maintain the illusion for your crew.

1665
01:54:09,370 --> 01:54:11,520
我的船员们得到救援了吗？
My crew are being rescued, yes?

1666
01:54:11,713 --> 01:54:12,880
像我们说的那样
As we speak.

1667
01:54:17,719 --> 01:54:20,639
- 是你发送的信息  - 对，长官
- You sent the signal. - That's correct, sir.

1668
01:54:22,933 --> 01:54:27,646
你是怎么知道我们的反应炉事故是假象？
Then how did you know our reactor accident was false?

1669
01:54:28,939 --> 01:54:31,900
猜的，但符合逻辑
That was a guess, but it seemed logical.

1670
01:54:38,907 --> 01:54:40,659
很好
Very well.

1671
01:54:44,240 --> 01:54:45,746
我们送给你们…
I present you...

1672
01:54:46,847 --> 01:54:49,410
红色十月号弹道导弹潜艇
the ballistic missile submarine Red October.

1673
01:54:54,130 --> 01:54:57,308
我和指挥官们要求庇护…
My officers and I request asylum...

1674
01:54:58,574 --> 01:55:00,170
在美国境内寻求
in the United States of America.

1675
01:55:03,130 --> 01:55:04,271
很荣幸，先生
It's a pleasure, sir.

1676
01:55:05,060 --> 01:55:07,631
巴特・曼库索，美国达拉斯号军舰
Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1677
01:55:10,522 --> 01:55:13,316
鱼雷，美国人又在向我们射击
Torpedo. The Americans are shooting at us again.

1678
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,062
射程太高了
The pitch is too high.

1679
01:55:15,915 --> 01:55:17,360
鱼雷是俄国人射的
The torpedo's Russian.

1680
01:55:17,612 --> 01:55:20,073
你说另一枚水雷是什么意思？它打哪来？
What do you mean another torpedo? Where the hell did it come from?

1681
01:55:20,150 --> 01:55:22,640
指挥舱，这里是声纳，新的信号，塞拉41号
Conn, Sonar. New contact. Sierra 4-1.

1682
01:55:22,731 --> 01:55:24,450
阿法级苏联潜艇
Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1683
01:55:27,789 --> 01:55:29,749
为什么我听不到爆炸声？
Why don't I have a detonation?

1684
01:55:29,833 --> 01:55:31,710
武器只能对着目标的远端发射
The weapon enabled on the far side of the target.

1685
01:55:31,790 --> 01:55:34,050
而它在射击前已经超过了红色十月号
It passed Red October before arming.

1686
01:55:34,290 --> 01:55:36,646
我们搞错了射程，按照正确的设定再次开火
We got wrong range, fire again with the right settings

1687
01:55:36,728 --> 01:55:38,380
两个发射管重新装上炮弹
and reload both tubes.

1688
01:55:38,466 --> 01:55:39,801
武力准备
Get me power.

1689
01:55:39,880 --> 01:55:42,524
- 让那鬼东西离我的潜艇远点  - 它会的
- Get that damn thing off my boat. - It's off.

1690
01:55:43,888 --> 01:55:46,433
又有人向我们发射了鱼雷
I think somebody shot a torpedo at us.

1691
01:55:46,516 --> 01:55:49,644
- 赶快离开这里  - 哪里…
- No shit, buckwheat. Get out of here. - Where am I...

1692
01:55:57,736 --> 01:55:59,779
舰长正在教训他们
The Captain is fighting them.

1693
01:55:59,860 --> 01:56:01,675
舰长正在和美国人战斗
The Captain is fighting the Americans.

1694
01:56:01,768 --> 01:56:03,650
舰长正在和美国人战斗
The Captain is fighting the Americans.

1695
01:56:04,659 --> 01:56:07,329
伯罗丁，射击控制
Borodin, fire control.

1696
01:56:08,362 --> 01:56:09,960
莱恩，坐到这来
Ryan. Sit here.

1697
01:56:10,384 --> 01:56:12,957
我不是海军指挥官 我是中央情报局的
I'm not a naval officer. I'm with the CIA.

1698
01:56:13,001 --> 01:56:14,878
- 中央情报局？  - 我不是特工
- CIA? - I'm not an agent.

1699
01:56:15,003 --> 01:56:17,672
我只是为中央情报局写书
I just write books for the CIA.

1700
01:56:18,381 --> 01:56:21,051
管他的，坐下，按照我说的做
Whatever. Sit down. And do exactly what I tell you.

1701
01:56:21,176 --> 01:56:22,510
深潜救助艇离开了
DSRVs away.

1702
01:56:22,594 --> 01:56:25,263
右舷八千码处有一艘阿法级苏联潜艇
There's a Russian Alfa 8,000 yards to starboard.

1703
01:56:25,347 --> 01:56:27,390
我认为那是科洛瓦罗夫
I think it's the Konovalov.

1704
01:56:27,515 --> 01:56:30,393
- 侧翼加速  - 侧翼加速
- Increase the flank. - Increase the flank.

1705
01:56:30,890 --> 01:56:31,989
怎么做？
How?

1706
01:56:32,855 --> 01:56:35,440
按钮转到右满舵
That knob. Turn right full.

1707
01:56:36,900 --> 01:56:39,277
全速前进，右满舵
All ahead flank. Right full rudder.

1708
01:56:39,361 --> 01:56:42,238
- 长官，他又在射击了  - 准备应战
- He's shooting again, sir. - Go to battle stations.

1709
01:56:42,360 --> 01:56:43,614
准备应战
Battle stations.

1710
01:56:43,741 --> 01:56:46,200
指挥官，开启武器系统
Chief of Watch, man battle stations.

1711
01:56:49,287 --> 01:56:52,707
水中发现鱼雷，方位315
Torpedo in the water. Bearing 3-1-5.

1712
01:56:52,790 --> 01:56:54,268
距离七千码
Make range 7,000 yards.

1713
01:56:54,356 --> 01:56:56,709
向右转舵到315
Steer right 3-1-5.

1714
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,511
那是朝着鱼雷方向
That's heading into the torpedo.

1715
01:56:58,919 --> 01:57:00,840
按原定方向走315
Steady, bearing still 3-1-5.

1716
01:57:00,920 --> 01:57:02,880
估算距离为六千码
Estimated range, 6,000 yards.

1717
01:57:02,991 --> 01:57:04,340
还是在315方向
Still 3-1-5.

1718
01:57:04,427 --> 01:57:07,013
右转舵，直到这里显示315
Steer right till this reads 3-1-5.

1719
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:08,033
那样不对
No, that's wrong.

1720
01:57:08,138 --> 01:57:10,530
莱恩，千万不要转动方向盘
Ryan, don't turn that god damn wheel.

1721
01:57:11,935 --> 01:57:14,270
方位315
3-1-5.

1722
01:57:25,115 --> 01:57:28,076
你这是直接冲着水雷去的
You're heading straight into that torpedo.

1723
01:57:28,159 --> 01:57:31,037
- 是的  - 他在做什么？
- Yes. - Doing what?

1724
01:57:31,121 --> 01:57:33,706
- 他转向正对鱼雷  - 什么？
- He's turned into the torpedo's path. - What?

1725
01:57:33,790 --> 01:57:37,001
长官，红色十月号正对鱼雷
Red October's turned directly into the torpedo's path, sir.

1726
01:57:37,085 --> 01:57:38,837
我的天
Mother of God.

1727
01:57:39,254 --> 01:57:42,590
鱼雷还在315方向，距离五千码
Torpedo steady, bearing 3-1-5. Range, 5,000 yards.

1728
01:57:42,674 --> 01:57:44,676
麦勒金，再快点
Melekhin, more speed.

1729
01:57:44,759 --> 01:57:47,720
不行，航速已达110
Negative. We are already running 110%.

1730
01:57:47,804 --> 01:57:49,556
那就以115的速度
Then get me 115%.

1731
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:51,912
距离大概有三千码
Estimate range 3,000 yards.

1732
01:57:51,992 --> 01:57:53,970
并且在以惊人的速度接近
Closing awfully fast.

1733
01:58:00,191 --> 01:58:03,236
他朝着鱼雷去了，他想干什么，自杀吗？
He's heading right into the torpedo. What's he trying to do, kill himself?

1734
01:58:03,319 --> 01:58:05,363
汤普森，我们有反击能力
We have a firing solution on the Russian Alfa.

1735
01:58:05,447 --> 01:58:07,449
- 我们可以回击吗？  - 他们又没向我们开炮
- Can we shoot back? - They didn't shoot at us.

1736
01:58:07,532 --> 01:58:11,327
未经授权，我不能袭击苏联潜艇
I can't attack a Soviet submarine without authorization.

1737
01:58:14,268 --> 01:58:16,395
鱼雷方向还是315
Torpedo bearing, steady at 3-1-5.

1738
01:58:16,541 --> 01:58:18,870
距离最多只有九百码
Best range, 900 yards.

1739
01:58:20,170 --> 01:58:23,631
水雷将在二十秒后击中我们
Torpedo impact, 20 seconds.

1740
01:58:25,216 --> 01:58:27,010
什么书？
What books?

1741
01:58:28,130 --> 01:58:29,181
你说什么？
Pardon me?

1742
01:58:29,410 --> 01:58:31,065
你写的是什么书？
What books did you write?

1743
01:58:32,640 --> 01:58:34,996
我为哈尔西将军写了本自传
I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey

1744
01:58:35,073 --> 01:58:36,411
名字叫做《战斗水手》
called The Fighting Sailor,

1745
01:58:36,477 --> 01:58:38,930
是关于海战战术的
about naval combat tactics.

1746
01:58:39,022 --> 01:58:40,607
我知道这本书
I know this book.

1747
01:58:40,690 --> 01:58:41,774
水雷撞击…
Torpedo impact...

1748
01:58:41,858 --> 01:58:43,610
你的结论是错，莱恩
Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan.

1749
01:58:43,690 --> 01:58:44,919
十秒
Ten seconds.

1750
01:58:44,991 --> 01:58:46,588
哈尔西的做法很愚蠢
Halsey acted stupidly.

1751
01:58:46,988 --> 01:58:52,285
九、八、七、六
Nine, eight, seven, six,

1752
01:58:52,368 --> 01:58:57,207
五、四、三、二…
five, four, three, two...

1753
01:58:57,832 --> 01:59:00,293
鱼雷撞击…
Torpedo impact...

1754
01:59:00,376 --> 01:59:02,212
现在
Now.

1755
01:59:10,762 --> 01:59:13,681
真该死
I'll be damned.

1756
01:59:14,680 --> 01:59:15,793
怎么了？
What happened?

1757
01:59:16,447 --> 01:59:18,100
这是战术，莱恩先生
Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

1758
01:59:19,395 --> 01:59:20,813
舰长朝着鱼雷前进
By turning into the torpedo,

1759
01:59:20,890 --> 01:59:24,022
鱼雷因距离太近，无法及时引爆
the captain closed the distance before it could arm itself.

1760
01:59:25,610 --> 01:59:28,488
- 就这样吗？  - 不完全是
- So that's it? - Not quite.

1761
01:59:28,571 --> 01:59:30,323
托普洛夫船长
Right now, Captain Tupolev

1762
01:59:30,406 --> 01:59:33,201
正在消除所有武器的安全设置
is removing the safety features on all his weapons.

1763
01:59:33,284 --> 01:59:36,204
他不会再犯同样的错误
He won't make the same mistake twice.

1764
01:59:36,847 --> 01:59:39,186
瓦西里，想出对策了吗？
Vasily, have you plotted a solution yet?

1765
01:59:39,443 --> 01:59:41,793
是，船长，可能有些粗糙，但…
Aye, Captain. It's a little rough, but I...

1766
01:59:47,920 --> 01:59:48,839
枪声？
Gunfire?

1767
01:59:49,683 --> 01:59:51,210
好像是的，长官
That's what it sounded like, sir.

1768
01:59:51,399 --> 01:59:52,883
不会改变他的想法？
Won't change his mind?

1769
01:59:52,949 --> 01:59:54,180
是一名船员
It's one of the crew.

1770
01:59:54,264 --> 01:59:57,767
不管他是谁，都会重新考虑的
Whoever he is, he's having second thoughts.

1771
02:00:15,243 --> 02:00:18,413
我本来可以去蒙大拿州的
I would like to have seen Montana.

1772
02:00:31,759 --> 02:00:34,554
舰长，他朝导弹舱去了
Captain, he stumbled forward into the missile bay.

1773
02:00:34,637 --> 02:00:38,016
左舷二十号弹筒舱发出警报
There's a silo hatch warning port side, number 20.

1774
02:00:38,090 --> 02:00:39,487
他想要发射导弹
He can't launch a missile.

1775
02:00:39,697 --> 02:00:41,537
不是，但他可以搞破坏
No, but he can blow one up.

1776
02:00:44,480 --> 02:00:47,442
- 舰长，接管指挥舱  - 射击控制舱会被炸飞
- Captain, take the conn. - Fire control's blasted to hell.

1777
02:00:47,520 --> 02:00:49,407
到他后面去停在那
Then get behind him and stay there.

1778
02:00:49,498 --> 02:00:50,803
舰长，等一下
Captain, wait.

1779
02:00:54,824 --> 02:00:57,785
你可能需要这个，长官
You may need this, sir.

1780
02:01:00,496 --> 02:01:02,165
谢谢
Thank you.

1781
02:01:05,793 --> 02:01:08,212
不要只是站在那里，莱恩，跟他去
Don't just stand there, Ryan. Go with him!

1782
02:01:08,296 --> 02:01:10,089
- 你会说英语吗？  - 会，先生
- You, you speak English? - Yes, sir.

1783
02:01:10,173 --> 02:01:11,507
你过来
Get your butt over here.

1784
02:01:11,633 --> 02:01:13,885
舰长，鱼雷在撞击时中断了信号
Captain, torpedo broke off on impact.

1785
02:01:13,968 --> 02:01:16,971
把安全范围设置到零
Set the safety ranges for zero.

1786
02:01:17,055 --> 02:01:18,765
已经到极限了
I cannot go any faster.

1787
02:01:18,848 --> 02:01:22,560
我们必须在他到达点火装置前抓住他
We must get him before he gets to the ignition circuits.

1788
02:01:30,526 --> 02:01:33,613
如果他到达点火装置会怎样？
What happens if he gets to that ignition circuitry?

1789
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:36,574
他会毁掉这艘潜艇
He can incinerate the ship.

1790
02:01:44,332 --> 02:01:47,043
那扇门是从这出去唯一的道路吗？
Is that door the only way out of here?

1791
02:01:48,378 --> 02:01:49,545
是的
Yes.

1792
02:01:50,171 --> 02:01:52,256
不要让他从这跑了
Don't let him get past you.

1793
02:01:53,090 --> 02:01:54,392
莱恩
Ryan.

1794
02:01:54,850 --> 02:01:56,920
不要随便开枪
Be careful what you shoot at.

1795
02:01:58,340 --> 02:01:59,780
这里的大部分东西…
Most things in here...

1796
02:01:59,887 --> 02:02:02,025
是经不起子弹射击的
don't react too well to bullets.

1797
02:02:05,186 --> 02:02:06,771
好
Right.

1798
02:02:25,206 --> 02:02:28,584
我不能随便开枪？
I have to be careful what I shoot at?

1799
02:02:36,217 --> 02:02:37,760
安全范围设置为零了
Safety ranges set to zero.

1800
02:02:37,885 --> 02:02:39,887
告诉我红色十月号的方位
Sonar, give me the bearing for Red October.

1801
02:02:39,971 --> 02:02:41,806
它在我们后面
She's positioned behind us.

1802
02:02:41,889 --> 02:02:45,226
右满舵，我要彻底打败他
Right full rudder! I'll shake the man loose.

1803
02:02:52,442 --> 02:02:54,861
- 它向下潜了  - 向下三十度
- He's going deep. - Thirty degree down angle!

1804
02:02:54,944 --> 02:02:57,530
这是所有的反制策略吗？
All the countermeasures were over there, right?

1805
02:02:57,613 --> 02:02:58,656
很好
Very well.

1806
02:03:24,370 --> 02:03:25,931
将军，阿法级潜艇速度太快
Admiral, the Alfa's too quick.

1807
02:03:26,044 --> 02:03:27,926
红色十月迟早会被歼灭
It's only a matter of time.

1808
02:03:28,810 --> 02:03:29,813
莱恩
"Ryan,

1809
02:03:30,232 --> 02:03:33,270
这里的某些东西禁不起子弹射击
some things in here don't react well to bullets."

1810
02:03:33,350 --> 02:03:34,207
是啊
Yeah.

1811
02:03:34,408 --> 02:03:35,600
就像我
Like me.

1812
02:03:35,744 --> 02:03:37,020
我禁不起子弹射击
I don't react well to bullets.

1813
02:03:56,631 --> 02:03:59,008
- 现在位置，琼斯？  - 很近，长官
- Where's he now? - Close, sir.

1814
02:04:02,130 --> 02:04:04,177
正前方900米
Nine hundred meters, directly ahead.

1815
02:04:04,422 --> 02:04:05,260
抓住他了
Got him.

1816
02:04:05,348 --> 02:04:08,267
- 锁定它，准备发射鱼雷  - 我们离得太近了
- Match bearings and fire. - We are too close!

1817
02:04:08,351 --> 02:04:10,436
别吵，发动武器
Don't argue. Launch the weapon.

1818
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,355
鱼雷已全部装填，最好不要…
The torpedoes are armed in the tubes! You cannot...

1819
02:04:12,480 --> 02:04:14,315
现在发射
Do it now!

1820
02:04:16,690 --> 02:04:19,567
另一枚水雷 已进入引爆程序
Another torpedo. It went active the moment it was launched.

1821
02:04:19,688 --> 02:04:20,960
它朝我们来了

1822
02:04:21,046 --> 02:04:22,940
左满舵 全速左转，船头微倾
Left full rudder. Ease off on your bow planes.

1823
02:04:23,032 --> 02:04:25,159
我认为他找到我们了
I think he's got us.

1824
02:04:34,710 --> 02:04:37,547
做得好！达拉斯号
Way to go, Dallas!

1825
02:04:41,509 --> 02:04:44,262
捕捉到了鱼雷的信息，距离五百码并持续接近
Torpedo is in acquisition. Range 500 yards and closing.

1826
02:04:44,340 --> 02:04:46,033
汤普森先生，你做到了！
You've done it, Mr. Thompson!

1827
02:04:46,679 --> 02:04:48,090
感谢上帝
I hope this works.

1828
02:04:48,558 --> 02:04:50,768
指挥官，升到水面上去
Chief, put us on the roof.

1829
02:04:50,850 --> 02:04:52,806
反导控制中心，听我的指令
Countermeasure station, on my mark.

1830
02:04:52,935 --> 02:04:54,600
五、四…
Five, four...

1831
02:04:57,525 --> 02:05:00,987
发射反导导弹，紧急发射
One. Release countermeasures. Emergency blow!

1832
02:05:01,070 --> 02:05:02,697
全速上升，紧急排气
Full rise. Fair water plane.

1833
02:05:08,410 --> 02:05:11,333
600英尺，550英尺
Six hundred feet, 550,

1834
02:05:11,465 --> 02:05:12,700
500英尺
500 feet.

1835
02:05:13,541 --> 02:05:16,794
- 450英尺  - 来吧，达拉斯
- Four-fifty. - Come on, big D. Fly.

1836
02:05:30,391 --> 02:05:33,436
舰长把他们吓得浮出了水面
Captain scared 'em out of the water!

1837
02:05:35,890 --> 02:05:37,269
鱼雷仍处在活跃状态
That torpedo's still active.

1838
02:05:37,443 --> 02:05:39,236
正在寻找另一个目标
It's searching for another target.

1839
02:06:05,009 --> 02:06:07,094
一个该死的厨师！
A goddamn cook!

1840
02:06:34,091 --> 02:06:35,741
它锁定我们了！

1841
02:06:35,790 --> 02:06:37,375
阿法级潜艇离我们多近，琼斯？
How close is that Alfa, Jonesy?

1842
02:06:37,450 --> 02:06:39,636
船尾方向1000码向左舷方向行进
Thousand yards, going to port.

1843
02:06:39,741 --> 02:06:40,790
改变方向
Reverse your turn.

1844
02:06:47,340 --> 02:06:48,877
我们正转向他
We're turning straight at him.

1845
02:06:49,349 --> 02:06:51,380
鱼雷还在我们后面
Torpedo's still on our tail.

1846
02:06:55,685 --> 02:06:59,563
玩老鹰抓小鸡最难的就是知道何时应该退缩
The hard part about playing chicken is knowing when to flinch.

1847
02:07:05,531 --> 02:07:07,040
还有400码
Collision in 400 yards,

1848
02:07:07,192 --> 02:07:09,184
350码、300码…
350, 300...

1849
02:07:09,407 --> 02:07:11,325
舰长
Captain!

1850
02:07:11,409 --> 02:07:14,120
右满舵，向下潜30度
Right full rudder, 30 degree down angle.

1851
02:07:14,203 --> 02:07:17,373
是，长官，太近了
Aye, sir. This one's going to be close.

1852
02:07:21,870 --> 02:07:23,286
正前方有鱼雷
Torpedo dead ahead!

1853
02:07:23,371 --> 02:07:25,688
你这个自大狂害死了我们
You arrogant ass. You've killed us.

1854
02:07:53,868 --> 02:07:58,039
我们已经调查过红色十月号最后出没的地点了
We have ascertained the Red October's final position,

1855
02:07:58,414 --> 02:08:00,332
但是海水太深了
but given the depth of the water

1856
02:08:00,416 --> 02:08:03,627
而且残骸散落在那样广阔的水域中
and the fact that the wreckage spreads across a wide area,

1857
02:08:03,711 --> 02:08:06,505
我们还需要花些时间来调查清楚
it'll be some time before anything's recovered.

1858
02:08:06,589 --> 02:08:09,258
贵国正在向船员求证
However, your people are interviewing the crew now

1859
02:08:09,383 --> 02:08:12,136
并正在安排他们的回程
and making arrangements for their return.

1860
02:08:13,429 --> 02:08:16,807
这件事情真是太不幸了，大使先生
This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador.

1861
02:08:17,099 --> 02:08:20,019
而且我想强调，如果你早点来找我们
And I can only stress that if you'd come to us earlier

1862
02:08:20,102 --> 02:08:22,438
事情也许可以避免
it might have been avoided.

1863
02:08:23,560 --> 02:08:25,915
我很感谢你能公正的处理这件事
I appreciate your candor in the matter.

1864
02:08:26,304 --> 02:08:28,310
我也是，安德烈
And I yours, Andrei.

1865
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:35,015
也许不久以后，科技能发展的更先进
Perhaps in the future, the technology will be available,

1866
02:08:35,109 --> 02:08:38,042
使我们能对残骸进行彻底的调查
allow a more thorough investigation of the wreckage.

1867
02:08:38,621 --> 02:08:40,456
也许吧
Perhaps.

1868
02:08:46,253 --> 02:08:48,589
还有一件事…
There is another matter...

1869
02:08:48,670 --> 02:08:50,455
很难以启齿…
One that I'm reluctant to...

1870
02:08:50,825 --> 02:08:51,666
请讲
Please.

1871
02:08:54,136 --> 02:08:56,180
我们的一艘阿法级潜艇
One of our submarines, an Alfa,

1872
02:08:56,263 --> 02:09:00,601
最近的一次报告显示她在大浅滩区域
was last reported in the area of the Grand Banks.

1873
02:09:01,268 --> 02:09:04,772
我们有段时间没有它的消息
We have not heard from her for some time.

1874
02:09:06,607 --> 02:09:08,109
安德烈
Andrei.

1875
02:09:09,276 --> 02:09:12,655
你又丢失了另一艘潜艇
You've lost another submarine?

1876
02:09:19,953 --> 02:09:23,498
（佩诺布斯科特河  海港北部，缅因州）

1877
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:27,473
一路上
All this way...

1878
02:09:27,614 --> 02:09:30,323
我们都把潜艇藏一条河里
to hide a submarine in a river.

1879
02:09:31,632 --> 02:09:33,926
我们距离最近的海军基地只有100英哩
We're 100 miles from the nearest naval base,

1880
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:36,453
那里卫星是观测不到的
the last place that satellites will ever look.

1881
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:41,217
我就在这里长大
I grew up around here.

1882
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:47,035
我的祖父就在那座小岛附近教我钓鱼
My grandfather taught me to fish off that island right over there.

1883
02:09:51,527 --> 02:09:54,989
你还有一个问题没有问我
There's one question you haven't asked me yet.

1884
02:09:56,699 --> 02:09:58,242
“为什么那样做？”
Why?

1885
02:10:00,369 --> 02:10:03,539
我觉得你准备好了就会给我答案的
I figured you would tell me when you were ready.

1886
02:10:06,800 --> 02:10:08,237
有一部分人认为
Now, there are those who believe

1887
02:10:08,331 --> 02:10:10,960
我们应该首先攻击美国
we should attack the United States first,

1888
02:10:11,330 --> 02:10:13,250
瞬间解决一切问题
settle everything in one moment.

1889
02:10:14,293 --> 02:10:16,550
红色十月号就是为这个目的而建造的
Red October was built for that purpose.

1890
02:10:18,220 --> 02:10:19,555
这样做了之后
When the dust settles from this,

1891
02:10:19,680 --> 02:10:21,807
莫斯科又会烽火连天
there's going to be hell to pay in Moscow.

1892
02:10:21,890 --> 02:10:23,357
也许吧
Perhaps.

1893
02:10:23,807 --> 02:10:25,763
或许这样反而好
Maybe something good will come from it.

1894
02:10:27,060 --> 02:10:29,327
有时来个小变革
A little revolution, now and then,

1895
02:10:29,608 --> 02:10:31,560
是件好事，你不这样认为吗？
is a healthy thing, don't you think?

1896
02:10:38,570 --> 02:10:40,648
莱恩，你还喜欢钓鱼吗？
Do you still like to fish, Ryan?

1897
02:10:43,910 --> 02:10:46,042
有一条河，跟这条河差不多
There's a river, not unlike this one,

1898
02:10:46,257 --> 02:10:47,660
在维尔纽斯附近
near Vilnius,

1899
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:50,711
我的祖父曾在那里教我钓鱼
where my grandfather taught me to fish.
