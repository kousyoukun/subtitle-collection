1
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:49,435
Hey, what are you doing?

2
00:04:49,435 --> 00:04:51,935
You're supposed to be
upstairs sleeping.

3
00:04:51,935 --> 00:04:54,645
Stanley keeps waking me up.

4
00:04:54,645 --> 00:04:57,775
Oh, ho, ho. I get it.

5
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,735
Boy, are you getting heavy.

6
00:04:59,735 --> 00:05:02,735
Don't let her pull more
than her usual nonsense.

7
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,285
Two stories,
two glasses of water.

8
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,245
Jack, you're going
to miss the plane.

9
00:05:08,245 --> 00:05:10,745
OK. Cricket,
you listen to me.

10
00:05:10,745 --> 00:05:14,285
Go upstairs with Mrs. Wheeler now
and go to sleep.

11
00:05:14,285 --> 00:05:15,745
On my business trip,

12
00:05:15,745 --> 00:05:17,755
I'll get Stanley
a little brother.

13
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:19,295
Will you promise?

14
00:05:19,295 --> 00:05:53,705
I promise.

15
00:05:53,705 --> 00:05:56,545
Can I get you anything, sir?

16
00:05:56,545 --> 00:05:58,375
No, thank you very much.

17
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,875
If you try and get sleep,

18
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,835
the flight will go faster.

19
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:05,845
I can never sleep on a plane.

20
00:06:05,845 --> 00:06:07,215
Turbulence.

21
00:06:07,215 --> 00:06:08,635
Pardon?

22
00:06:08,635 --> 00:06:10,675
Turbulence...

23
00:06:10,675 --> 00:06:12,685
Solar radiation
heats the Earth's crust,

24
00:06:12,685 --> 00:06:14,685
warm air rises,
cold airs descends.

25
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:17,015
Turbulence.
I don't like that.

26
00:06:17,015 --> 00:06:57,265
Oh. Well, try to sleep anyway.

27
00:06:57,265 --> 00:07:15,615
Dr Ryan?

28
00:07:15,615 --> 00:07:18,785
Jack, boy,
get yourself in here.

29
00:07:18,785 --> 00:07:20,795
Jesus!
You look like hell.

30
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:22,795
Thank you very much, Admiral.

31
00:07:22,795 --> 00:07:23,965
Want coffee?

32
00:07:23,965 --> 00:07:25,965
I think I need some coffee.

33
00:07:25,965 --> 00:07:29,465
I'm not going to ask you
how your flight went.

34
00:07:29,465 --> 00:07:32,465
When's the last time
you got some sleep?

35
00:07:32,465 --> 00:07:33,975
Oh, I don't know.

36
00:07:33,975 --> 00:07:36,475
This thing's still
on London time.

37
00:07:36,475 --> 00:07:37,975
Milk and sugar?

38
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:39,475
Milk and sugar.

39
00:07:39,475 --> 00:07:40,975
So how's Caroline?

40
00:07:40,975 --> 00:07:42,985
Last time I saw her

41
00:07:42,985 --> 00:07:46,485
was at your granddad's place
in Maine, wasn't it?

42
00:07:46,485 --> 00:07:49,315
She's fine.
Sends you her best.

43
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:50,735
And Sally?

44
00:07:50,735 --> 00:07:51,985
She's fine.

45
00:07:51,985 --> 00:07:55,075
What is she now, 3?

46
00:07:55,075 --> 00:07:58,785
Ah, no, she's
a very precocious 5.

47
00:07:58,785 --> 00:08:02,335
She announced to Caroline
and I the other day

48
00:08:02,335 --> 00:08:05,335
that her life would be
considerably less lonely

49
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:08,835
if we were to buy her
a baby brother.

50
00:08:08,835 --> 00:08:11,345
But she decided
it would be enough

51
00:08:11,345 --> 00:08:15,425
if we were to
buy one for Stanley.

52
00:08:15,425 --> 00:08:16,765
Who's Stanley?

53
00:08:16,765 --> 00:08:21,855
Uh... Stanley's a bear.

54
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:23,105
All right.

55
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:25,855
What's important enough
to get you on a plane

56
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,525
in the middle of the night?

57
00:08:27,525 --> 00:08:30,815
British Intelligence obtained
these pictures two days ago.

58
00:08:30,815 --> 00:08:32,325
She's the Red October,

59
00:08:32,325 --> 00:08:34,155
the latest typhoon class.

60
00:08:34,155 --> 00:08:36,155
Big son of a bitch.

61
00:08:36,155 --> 00:08:38,865
12 meters longer than
the standard typhoon.

62
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:40,325
3 meters wider.

63
00:08:40,325 --> 00:08:42,455
The captain's name is Ramius.

64
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:43,495
One of yours?

65
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:45,625
Yeah. I did his bio last year.

66
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,625
He's taken out the lead boat

67
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:50,635
in each new sub class
for 10 years.

68
00:08:50,635 --> 00:08:52,135
Fairly good
political connections.

69
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:55,135
Trained most of their
attack boat skippers.

70
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,385
The Russians call him
Vilnius Nastavnic...

71
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:03,065
the Vilnius schoolmaster.

72
00:09:03,065 --> 00:09:04,565
What are these doors?

73
00:09:04,565 --> 00:09:08,565
Those doors, sir, are the problem.

74
00:09:08,565 --> 00:09:09,905
I don't know what they are.

75
00:09:09,905 --> 00:09:11,405
Neither do the British.

76
00:09:11,405 --> 00:09:12,905
Perhaps our friends in Murmansk

77
00:09:12,905 --> 00:09:14,905
have come up with something new.

78
00:09:14,905 --> 00:09:18,405
With your permission,
I'd like to show these to someone.

79
00:09:18,405 --> 00:09:19,575
Do you know Skip Tyler?

80
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,825
Sub driver.

81
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:23,915
Was. Clipped by a drunk driver.
Lost his leg.

82
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:25,955
He's teaching at the academy,

83
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:27,205
consulting for Navy labs.

84
00:09:27,205 --> 00:09:28,335
Clearance?

85
00:09:28,335 --> 00:09:30,965
Top secret or better.

86
00:09:30,965 --> 00:09:33,595
Margie, have a car for Dr Ryan

87
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:39,685
downstairs in 10 minutes.

88
00:09:39,685 --> 00:09:41,645
A satellite caught Red October

89
00:09:41,645 --> 00:10:24,605
in Polijarny Inlet this morning.

90
00:10:24,605 --> 00:10:27,725
Do you hear it?

91
00:10:27,725 --> 00:10:29,065
No.

92
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:30,315
Beaumont, at Cal Tech

93
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:33,065
we used to do this
in our sleep.

94
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,775
You hear it now?

95
00:10:34,775 --> 00:10:36,325
Wait a minute.

96
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,485
Maybe.

97
00:10:37,485 --> 00:10:38,575
Um...

98
00:10:38,575 --> 00:10:40,615
It's buried in surface clutter?

99
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:42,245
Yes.

100
00:10:42,245 --> 00:10:44,285
I should go to SAPS?

101
00:10:44,285 --> 00:10:46,285
Correct, Seaman Beaumont.

102
00:10:46,285 --> 00:10:48,795
Signal algorithmic
processing systems.

103
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:50,295
Give it a week,

104
00:10:50,295 --> 00:10:54,425
and you'll be
teaching at Cal Tech.

105
00:10:54,425 --> 00:10:55,795
So...

106
00:10:55,795 --> 00:10:59,845
Like Beethoven on the computer,

107
00:10:59,845 --> 00:11:08,605
you have labored to produce...

108
00:11:08,605 --> 00:11:12,275
a biologic.

109
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:13,525
A what?

110
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:16,025
A whale, Beaumont.
A whale...

111
00:11:16,025 --> 00:11:17,485
A marine mammal

112
00:11:17,485 --> 00:11:20,905
that knows a hell
of a lot more about sonar

113
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,325
than you do.

114
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,745
Kill the SAPS.

115
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:27,535
Train over to 2-6-9
and let's try it again.

116
00:11:27,535 --> 00:11:30,085
If he gets to ragging
on you too bad,

117
00:11:30,085 --> 00:11:32,545
ask him about Pavarotti.

118
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:34,545
We don't have time
for sea stories.

119
00:11:34,545 --> 00:11:37,585
I was in the middle
of teaching Seaman Beaumont

120
00:11:37,585 --> 00:11:39,595
the intricacies
of modern sonar. Now...

121
00:11:39,595 --> 00:11:41,885
I ain't chief of the boat.

122
00:11:41,885 --> 00:11:43,765
I'm Sheena,
Queen of the Jungle.

123
00:11:43,765 --> 00:11:44,885
Cob, please.

124
00:11:44,885 --> 00:11:46,225
Come on, Cob. Tell me.

125
00:11:46,225 --> 00:11:49,015
OK. Fine. Go ahead.

126
00:11:49,015 --> 00:11:51,105
Ahem... Seaman Jones here,

127
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:53,525
he's into music in a big way.

128
00:11:53,525 --> 00:11:55,525
He figures this whole boat

129
00:11:55,525 --> 00:11:57,905
is basically just his own

130
00:11:57,905 --> 00:12:00,825
personal, private stereo set.

131
00:12:00,825 --> 00:12:02,745
He gets this
piece of Pavarotti...

132
00:12:02,745 --> 00:12:03,825
Paganini.

133
00:12:03,825 --> 00:12:04,825
Whatever.

134
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:05,825
Paganini.

135
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,285
This is my story, OK?

136
00:12:07,285 --> 00:12:10,245
Tell it right.
Pavarotti's a tenor.

137
00:12:10,245 --> 00:12:11,875
Paganini was a composer.

138
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:14,375
OK. So he's got this music,

139
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:17,425
and he's got it out
in the water.

140
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:19,425
He's listening
on his headsets,

141
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:20,755
happy as a clam.

142
00:12:20,755 --> 00:12:22,095
Then all hell breaks loose.

143
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:24,555
A slew of boats
out of San Diego...

144
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:26,095
Including one
way out at Pearl.

145
00:12:26,095 --> 00:12:28,095
Including one
way out at Pearl.

146
00:12:28,095 --> 00:12:30,265
All of a sudden,
they start hearing...

147
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:31,395
- Pavarotti.
- Pavarotti...

148
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:35,525
coming out of their asses.

149
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:37,775
What do I do?

150
00:12:37,775 --> 00:12:41,905
I got it.

151
00:12:41,905 --> 00:12:44,865
Conn. Sonar.
New contact, bearing 0-9-7.

152
00:12:44,865 --> 00:12:47,365
Designate contact
number Sierra 3-5.

153
00:12:47,365 --> 00:12:49,365
Captain, aye.
What've you got, Jones?

154
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:50,915
Distant contact,
probably submerged.

155
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:52,375
It's a wild guess,

156
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:54,915
but I'd say we hit a boomer

157
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:56,375
coming out of the barn.

158
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,215
Could be a missile boat
out of Polijarny.

159
00:12:59,215 --> 00:13:00,635
OK. Start your track.

160
00:13:00,635 --> 00:13:02,465
I'll be there in a minute.

161
00:13:02,465 --> 00:15:17,015
Sonar, aye.

162
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:19,265
...Armageddon.

163
00:15:19,265 --> 00:15:21,775
And the seventh angel
poured forth his bowl

164
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:23,275
into the air,

165
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:25,775
and a voice cried out
from heaven, saying,

166
00:15:25,775 --> 00:15:29,735
"It is done".

167
00:15:29,735 --> 00:15:31,745
A man with your responsibilities

168
00:15:31,745 --> 00:15:34,455
reading about the end
of the world. Huh.

169
00:15:34,455 --> 00:15:35,915
And what's this?

170
00:15:35,915 --> 00:15:38,375
"I am become death,

171
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:41,375
the destroyer of worlds".

172
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,875
It is an ancient Hindu text

173
00:15:43,875 --> 00:15:45,425
quoted by an American.

174
00:15:45,425 --> 00:15:46,465
American?

175
00:15:46,465 --> 00:15:48,925
Mmm.
He invented the atomic bomb,

176
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:51,715
and he was later accused
of being a Communist.

177
00:15:51,715 --> 00:15:56,765
You wrote and underlined
these passages?

178
00:15:56,765 --> 00:16:00,815
No.

179
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:03,275
This book belonged to my wife.

180
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:05,315
I keep it
for sentimental value.

181
00:16:05,315 --> 00:16:07,275
I'm sorry, comrade Captain.

182
00:16:07,275 --> 00:16:09,275
Your wife was...
a beautiful woman.

183
00:16:09,275 --> 00:16:11,325
Her death was... unfortunate.

184
00:16:11,325 --> 00:16:13,325
I'm only doing my job.

185
00:16:13,325 --> 00:16:17,825
It is my responsibility.

186
00:16:17,825 --> 00:16:21,705
How many agents did the KGB
put aboard my boat?

187
00:16:21,705 --> 00:16:23,255
Your boat, Captain?

188
00:16:23,255 --> 00:16:24,585
Yes.

189
00:16:24,585 --> 00:16:28,005
This vessel belongs to
the people of the Soviet Union.

190
00:16:28,005 --> 00:16:32,425
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU
has agents aboard,

191
00:16:32,425 --> 00:16:37,185
I will be the last to know.

192
00:16:37,185 --> 00:16:41,725
I suggest we open
our orders, Captain.

193
00:16:41,725 --> 00:17:26,275
Certainly, comrade.

194
00:17:26,275 --> 00:17:28,025
"From commander...

195
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:29,735
strategic submarine forces

196
00:17:29,735 --> 00:17:31,775
red banner northern fleet".

197
00:17:31,775 --> 00:17:37,195
We're to proceed north
to grid square reference 54-90

198
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:41,075
and rendezvous with
alfa submarine Konovalov.

199
00:17:41,075 --> 00:17:42,995
Captain Tupolev's boat.

200
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,545
You know Tupolev?

201
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:47,045
I know he descends
from aristocracy

202
00:17:47,045 --> 00:17:50,255
and that he was your student.

203
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:52,175
It's rumored he has
a special place

204
00:17:52,175 --> 00:17:53,635
in his heart for you.

205
00:17:53,635 --> 00:18:01,515
There's little room in Tupolev's heart
for anyone but Tupolev.

206
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:05,225
Having made contact,
we are to run a series of drills.

207
00:18:05,225 --> 00:18:08,275
Tupolev will hunt us
while we test our ship.

208
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:09,815
Having evaluated
the operational readiness

209
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:11,315
of the caterpillar drive,

210
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:13,315
we are to return to Polijarny

211
00:18:13,315 --> 00:18:17,365
on or about the 16th
of this month.

212
00:18:17,365 --> 00:18:19,905
Captain, this is
an historic moment.

213
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:21,865
I'd like to make a request.

214
00:18:21,865 --> 00:18:23,415
Before you proceed, comrade...

215
00:18:23,415 --> 00:18:25,035
I know it's not protocol,

216
00:18:25,035 --> 00:18:27,205
but would you permit me
to post our orders

217
00:18:27,205 --> 00:18:35,845
and inform the crew
of our mission?

218
00:18:35,845 --> 00:18:54,775
Aah!

219
00:18:54,775 --> 00:18:56,485
Where I'm going...

220
00:18:56,485 --> 00:19:27,435
you cannot follow.

221
00:19:27,435 --> 00:19:31,185
Dr Petrov, report
to my cabin immediately.

222
00:19:31,185 --> 00:20:03,425
There's been
a dreadful accident.

223
00:20:03,425 --> 00:20:13,735
Hey, buddy!

224
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:16,065
Daniel, got any more rods?

225
00:20:16,065 --> 00:20:17,235
More rods!

226
00:20:17,235 --> 00:20:20,025
Listen to me.
There's no cradle underneath it.

227
00:20:20,025 --> 00:20:21,485
Get it over.

228
00:20:21,485 --> 00:20:23,495
Relax!
Stop being an old maid.

229
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:26,495
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?

230
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,995
All right. Bring her up.

231
00:20:27,995 --> 00:20:30,375
What? What?

232
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,665
Ryan!

233
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,165
Who let you in here?

234
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,415
Hey, Skip,

235
00:20:34,415 --> 00:20:37,335
what, have they got you
playing with models now?

236
00:20:37,335 --> 00:20:38,675
Ahh!

237
00:20:38,675 --> 00:20:40,135
Damn it, Bill!

238
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:42,215
Tell them to slow down!

239
00:20:42,215 --> 00:20:44,215
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

240
00:20:44,215 --> 00:20:45,725
Calm down, will you?

241
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:48,645
It's not a model. The DSRV.

242
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:49,685
Rescue sub.

243
00:20:49,685 --> 00:20:51,185
I know what it is.

244
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:53,395
What are you doing with it?

245
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:55,895
We're rigging it
with a generic docking collar

246
00:20:55,895 --> 00:20:57,905
so it'll mate with
British, German...

247
00:20:57,905 --> 00:20:59,275
just about anybody's sub.

248
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:01,695
We can get it
anywhere in the world

249
00:21:01,695 --> 00:21:04,445
in 24 hours.

250
00:21:04,445 --> 00:21:05,995
How's your back?

251
00:21:05,995 --> 00:21:08,075
It's fine.

252
00:21:08,075 --> 00:21:11,915
Have you got a minute?

253
00:21:11,915 --> 00:21:15,415
Bigger than
a regular typhoon.

254
00:21:15,415 --> 00:21:16,965
What are these doors?

255
00:21:16,965 --> 00:21:19,425
You don't miss much, do you?

256
00:21:19,425 --> 00:21:23,965
Those are too big
to be torpedo tubes.

257
00:21:23,965 --> 00:21:26,265
Would you launch
an ICBM horizontally?

258
00:21:26,265 --> 00:21:28,305
Sure. Why would you want to?

259
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:31,555
They're symmetrical.

260
00:21:31,555 --> 00:21:34,145
Right down
the long axis of the sub.

261
00:21:34,145 --> 00:21:36,935
How about a towed sonar array?

262
00:21:36,935 --> 00:21:39,605
Nope.
Too close to the screws.

263
00:21:39,605 --> 00:21:43,485
I'll be...

264
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,485
This...

265
00:21:44,485 --> 00:21:46,035
This could be a caterpillar.

266
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:47,115
A what?

267
00:21:47,115 --> 00:21:48,825
Uh, a caterpillar drive.

268
00:21:48,825 --> 00:21:51,325
Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

269
00:21:51,325 --> 00:21:52,665
You follow?

270
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:53,835
No.

271
00:21:53,835 --> 00:21:57,295
It's like a...
a jet engine for the water.

272
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:59,505
Goes in the front,
gets squirted out the back.

273
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:01,505
Only it's got no moving parts,

274
00:22:01,505 --> 00:22:03,465
so it's very, very quiet.

275
00:22:03,465 --> 00:22:05,805
Like how quiet?

276
00:22:05,805 --> 00:22:08,845
It's doubtful our sonar
would even pick it up.

277
00:22:08,845 --> 00:22:10,305
And if it did,

278
00:22:10,305 --> 00:22:12,305
it would sound
like whales humping

279
00:22:12,305 --> 00:22:13,855
or a seismic anomaly.

280
00:22:13,855 --> 00:22:15,355
Anything but a submarine.

281
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:18,565
We messed with this
a couple of years ago.

282
00:22:18,565 --> 00:22:21,235
Couldn't make it work.

283
00:22:21,235 --> 00:22:22,775
They really built this?

284
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:25,485
This isn't a mock-up
or anything?

285
00:22:25,485 --> 00:22:33,625
She put to sea this morning.

286
00:22:33,625 --> 00:22:35,085
When I was 12,

287
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:38,585
I helped my daddy build
a bomb shelter in our basement

288
00:22:38,585 --> 00:22:41,085
because some fool parked
a dozen warheads

289
00:22:41,085 --> 00:22:44,675
90 miles off the
coast of Florida.

290
00:22:44,675 --> 00:22:47,675
This thing could park
a couple of hundred warheads

291
00:22:47,675 --> 00:22:49,175
off Washington and New York,

292
00:22:49,175 --> 00:22:51,685
and no one would know
anything about it

293
00:22:51,685 --> 00:23:04,945
until it was all over.

294
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:07,525
Are you all right, Captain?

295
00:23:07,525 --> 00:23:08,785
Oh, yes.

296
00:23:08,785 --> 00:23:11,285
It's just to die for something

297
00:23:11,285 --> 00:23:13,615
as petty as slipping on tea.

298
00:23:13,615 --> 00:23:16,125
You're blaming yourself, Captain.
It was an accident.

299
00:23:16,125 --> 00:23:18,625
You'll feel better
when we put in.

300
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:19,755
Put in?

301
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:21,465
Well, to base, Captain.

302
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:23,965
We cannot go on without
a political officer.

303
00:23:23,965 --> 00:23:27,465
Doctor, this is a combat vessel
of the Soviet Navy,

304
00:23:27,465 --> 00:23:29,965
and I'm a senior combat officer.

305
00:23:29,965 --> 00:23:34,935
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.

306
00:23:34,935 --> 00:23:36,265
Seaman.

307
00:23:36,265 --> 00:23:38,605
Come here.

308
00:23:38,605 --> 00:23:41,185
Come here.

309
00:23:41,185 --> 00:23:42,895
Your name?

310
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:44,695
Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.

311
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:49,445
Good. I want you and the doctor
to witness this.

312
00:23:49,445 --> 00:23:51,615
I'm removing
the political officer's...

313
00:23:51,615 --> 00:23:52,955
missile key...

314
00:23:52,955 --> 00:23:54,285
carry on...

315
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:56,455
and I'm keeping it myself.

316
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:58,455
Captain, I think
we should report this

317
00:23:58,455 --> 00:24:00,415
to Red Fleet Command.

318
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:01,705
I'm afraid
that's impossible, Doctor.

319
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:04,215
Our orders are
for strict radio silence.

320
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:05,795
Orders, sir.

321
00:24:05,795 --> 00:24:07,295
That's all, Loginov.

322
00:24:07,295 --> 00:24:08,295
Yes, sir.

323
00:24:08,295 --> 00:24:11,595
This is most unnerving,
Captain.

324
00:24:11,595 --> 00:24:15,135
The reason for having
two missile keys

325
00:24:15,135 --> 00:24:18,355
is so that no one man...

326
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:19,435
may...

327
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:22,935
May what?

328
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:24,695
May arm the missiles.

329
00:24:24,695 --> 00:24:26,695
Perhaps I should keep the key.

330
00:24:26,695 --> 00:24:28,735
Thank you.
That'll be all, Doctor.

331
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:29,735
Captain, I...

332
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:31,485
When I address the crew,

333
00:24:31,485 --> 00:24:33,995
then you will understand.

334
00:24:33,995 --> 00:24:37,825
Yes, sir.

335
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:39,125
Petrov.

336
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,285
Yes, sir?

337
00:24:40,285 --> 00:24:42,835
I will try to forget
your comments

338
00:24:42,835 --> 00:24:45,415
when I present my report.

339
00:24:45,415 --> 00:24:52,425
Thank you, sir.

340
00:24:52,425 --> 00:24:56,685
Holding steady on 3-1-0.

341
00:24:56,685 --> 00:24:58,685
12 knots
at about 20,000 yards.

342
00:24:58,685 --> 00:25:01,145
Have you got a make on him?

343
00:25:01,145 --> 00:25:02,685
Computer's chewing on it, sir.

344
00:25:02,685 --> 00:25:03,815
Twin screws.

345
00:25:03,815 --> 00:25:15,535
The plant noise
sounds like a typhoon.

346
00:25:15,535 --> 00:25:18,285
I'd say we got
a new boat, sir.

347
00:25:18,285 --> 00:25:21,165
Tommy, I miss something
on the boards?

348
00:25:21,165 --> 00:25:23,205
Sub plant hasn't said
anything about it.

349
00:25:23,205 --> 00:25:26,215
Hmm.

350
00:25:26,215 --> 00:25:27,335
All right.

351
00:25:27,335 --> 00:25:29,795
How many typhoons
we got in the computer?

352
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:30,795
Six, sir.

353
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,845
OK. Call this guy
Typhoon Seven.

354
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,305
Start a tape on him.

355
00:25:34,305 --> 00:25:36,805
See if we can work
in a little closer.

356
00:25:36,805 --> 00:25:38,725
Yes, sir.

357
00:25:38,725 --> 00:25:40,225
Won't he hear us?

358
00:25:40,225 --> 00:25:43,265
Not if we stay in his baffles,
Seaman Beaumont.

359
00:25:43,265 --> 00:25:45,815
Not if we stay in his baffles.

360
00:25:45,815 --> 00:25:47,395
Come in behind his propeller,

361
00:25:47,395 --> 00:26:18,385
and he's deaf as a post.

362
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:21,145
Any sonar contacts,
Mr. Kamarov?

363
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:23,855
No contacts, Captain.
The sonar is clear.

364
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:26,775
Good. Do we have any
surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?

365
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:29,275
No contacts, sir.
Scope is clear.

366
00:26:29,275 --> 00:26:31,315
Good. Then it is time

367
00:26:31,315 --> 00:26:35,235
I explain our orders
to the crew.

368
00:26:35,235 --> 00:26:37,865
Comrades, this is your captain.

369
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:40,825
It is an honor
to speak to you today,

370
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:43,375
and I'm honored
to be sailing with you

371
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:44,835
on the maiden voyage

372
00:26:44,835 --> 00:26:46,915
of our motherland's
most recent achievement.

373
00:26:46,915 --> 00:26:52,005
And once more,
we play our dangerous game,

374
00:26:52,005 --> 00:26:53,755
a game of chess,

375
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:56,305
against our old adversary...

376
00:26:56,305 --> 00:26:58,055
the American Navy.

377
00:26:58,055 --> 00:26:59,555
For 40 years,

378
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:02,805
your fathers before you
and your older brothers

379
00:27:02,805 --> 00:27:05,475
played this game
and played it well.

380
00:27:05,475 --> 00:27:08,355
But today,
the game is different.

381
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:10,985
We have the advantage.

382
00:27:10,985 --> 00:27:13,565
It reminds me of the heady days

383
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:15,065
of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin,

384
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:18,575
when the world trembled
at the sound of our rockets.

385
00:27:18,575 --> 00:27:20,575
Well, they will tremble again

386
00:27:20,575 --> 00:27:22,575
at the sound of our silence.

387
00:27:22,575 --> 00:27:25,575
The order is engage
for silent drive.

388
00:27:25,575 --> 00:27:26,785
Aye, sir.

389
00:27:26,785 --> 00:27:29,125
Ballast control,
open outer doors.

390
00:27:29,125 --> 00:27:30,625
Yes, open outer doors.

391
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:31,755
Diving command.

392
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:38,845
Engage caterpillar
and secure main engines.

393
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:40,595
Doors opening, Captain.

394
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:42,095
Comrades, our own fleet

395
00:27:42,095 --> 00:27:45,145
doesn't know
our full potential.

396
00:27:45,145 --> 00:27:47,895
They will do everything
possible to test us,

397
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:50,895
but they will only test
their own embarrassment.

398
00:27:50,895 --> 00:27:53,395
We will leave our fleet behind.

399
00:27:53,395 --> 00:27:55,945
We will pass through
the American patrols,

400
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:57,695
pass their sonar nets,

401
00:27:57,695 --> 00:28:00,575
and lay off their largest city

402
00:28:00,575 --> 00:28:03,495
and listen
to their rock 'n' roll

403
00:28:03,495 --> 00:28:06,625
while we conduct missile drills.

404
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:08,835
Then...

405
00:28:08,835 --> 00:28:10,205
And when we are finished,

406
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:12,205
the only sound they will hear

407
00:28:12,205 --> 00:28:13,875
is our laughter

408
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,835
while we sail to Havana,

409
00:28:15,835 --> 00:28:21,595
where the sun is warm
and so is the comradeship.

410
00:28:21,595 --> 00:28:23,725
Cryogenic plant
coming on line, Captain.

411
00:28:23,725 --> 00:28:26,345
A great day, comrades.

412
00:28:26,345 --> 00:28:34,895
We sail into history.

413
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:39,575
Caterpillar engaging.

414
00:28:39,575 --> 00:28:56,465
Caterpillar engaging,
Captain.

415
00:28:56,465 --> 00:28:57,715
What happened?

416
00:28:57,715 --> 00:29:25,745
I don't know.

417
00:29:25,745 --> 00:29:27,245
Full rudder left.

418
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,785
Full rudder left.

419
00:29:28,785 --> 00:29:29,785
Navigator.

420
00:29:29,785 --> 00:29:32,585
New course, 2-5-0.

421
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,625
Yes, new course, 2-5-0.

422
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:35,955
Steering 2-5-0.

423
00:29:35,955 --> 00:30:09,575
Yes, course is 2-5-0.

424
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,125
Sonar contact, Captain.
Port quarter.

425
00:30:11,125 --> 00:30:12,375
Close aboard.

426
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,705
American,

427
00:30:13,705 --> 00:30:16,295
Los Angeles class.

428
00:30:16,295 --> 00:30:17,875
American. Captain, we...

429
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,545
Course 3-1-0.

430
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:23,965
Is the American
turning to follow us?

431
00:30:23,965 --> 00:30:25,385
No, Captain.

432
00:30:25,385 --> 00:30:28,595
The American is continuing
in his original course.

433
00:30:28,595 --> 00:30:30,385
He's continuing northwest.

434
00:30:30,385 --> 00:30:32,435
He can't hear us.

435
00:30:32,435 --> 00:30:48,445
And the singing?

436
00:30:48,445 --> 00:31:09,885
Let them sing.

437
00:31:09,885 --> 00:31:12,055
What are you talking about?
Check your gear.

438
00:31:12,055 --> 00:31:19,855
Running diagnostics now,
Captain.

439
00:31:19,855 --> 00:31:22,315
Sonar is working, Captain.

440
00:31:22,315 --> 00:31:23,905
The Russian disappeared.

441
00:31:23,905 --> 00:31:25,405
One minute, he was steady

442
00:31:25,405 --> 00:31:26,905
4,000 yards off the bow,

443
00:31:26,905 --> 00:31:28,535
and then he was gone,

444
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:32,405
and for a second,
I thought I heard...

445
00:31:32,405 --> 00:31:34,745
Heard what?

446
00:31:34,745 --> 00:31:38,835
I thought I heard singing, sir.

447
00:31:38,835 --> 00:31:40,125
Singing?

448
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:55,805
Yes, sir.

449
00:31:55,805 --> 00:31:59,685
Yah, yah.

450
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:04,485
Yah, yah, yah.

451
00:32:04,485 --> 00:32:09,365
Yah, yah.

452
00:32:09,365 --> 00:32:10,825
Good morning, sir.

453
00:32:10,825 --> 00:32:13,325
I hope we had a lovely evening.

454
00:32:13,325 --> 00:32:14,495
Yah, yah.

455
00:32:14,495 --> 00:32:40,315
A little chilly this morning.

456
00:32:40,315 --> 00:32:45,645
There's a letter there
from Marko Ramius.

457
00:32:45,645 --> 00:33:19,435
Ah, Marko.

458
00:33:19,435 --> 00:33:20,895
Yes?

459
00:33:20,895 --> 00:33:27,315
No. This is Dr Ryan.

460
00:33:27,315 --> 00:33:28,855
What the hell happened?

461
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:29,985
Come on.

462
00:33:29,985 --> 00:33:35,615
This is no longer
a research project.

463
00:33:35,615 --> 00:33:40,165
I got a line on those doors.

464
00:33:40,165 --> 00:33:44,295
You know what they are?

465
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:47,215
A nearly silent
propulsion system?

466
00:33:47,215 --> 00:33:49,215
How did you know that?

467
00:33:49,215 --> 00:33:52,215
The captain of the sub
following her radioed in.

468
00:33:52,215 --> 00:33:54,715
Thing disappeared
right in front of him,

469
00:33:54,715 --> 00:33:57,225
and that's only
the half of it.

470
00:33:57,225 --> 00:34:05,025
Read.

471
00:34:05,025 --> 00:34:08,105
Oh! I'm sorry.

472
00:34:08,105 --> 00:34:09,405
Got your I.D.?

473
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:11,565
My God, this is unbelievable.

474
00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:14,275
The Kirov, three Sverdlovs,

475
00:34:14,275 --> 00:34:15,985
the Kiev, the Minsk.

476
00:34:15,985 --> 00:34:17,995
They've sortied
their whole bloody fleet.

477
00:34:17,995 --> 00:34:19,995
That's about the size of it.

478
00:34:19,995 --> 00:34:21,495
Good afternoon, Admiral.

479
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:22,415
Afternoon, Matthew.

480
00:34:22,415 --> 00:34:24,585
Where are we going anyway?

481
00:34:24,585 --> 00:34:26,705
Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt,

482
00:34:26,705 --> 00:34:29,165
President's National
Security Adviser.

483
00:34:29,165 --> 00:34:31,965
Most of the Joint Chiefs
will be there,

484
00:34:31,965 --> 00:34:34,295
along with a few other people.

485
00:34:34,295 --> 00:34:36,055
Who's giving the briefing?

486
00:34:36,055 --> 00:34:37,175
You are.

487
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,845
The yeoman will
have all the slides

488
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:41,345
Laid out for you.

489
00:34:41,345 --> 00:34:48,025
So all you got to do...

490
00:34:48,025 --> 00:34:49,855
Look.

491
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,865
No one understands
this material better than you.

492
00:34:52,865 --> 00:34:55,365
Just give him
a rundown on the sub

493
00:34:55,365 --> 00:34:58,325
and a precis of the
stuff in your hand.

494
00:34:58,325 --> 00:35:00,905
He's liable to ask
some direct questions.

495
00:35:00,905 --> 00:35:02,365
Give him direct answers.

496
00:35:02,365 --> 00:35:05,245
Tell him what you think.

497
00:35:05,245 --> 00:35:08,205
Come on.

498
00:35:08,205 --> 00:35:10,045
Ahem.

499
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:12,375
Ahem.

500
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:14,925
Uh, gentlemen,
the last 24 hours

501
00:35:14,925 --> 00:35:18,635
have seen some extraordinary
Soviet naval activity.

502
00:35:18,635 --> 00:35:21,635
The first to sail
was this ship,

503
00:35:21,635 --> 00:35:23,645
we believe
called the Red October

504
00:35:23,645 --> 00:35:26,315
in reference to
the October Revolution of 1917.

505
00:35:26,315 --> 00:35:28,855
A variant
of the typhoon class,

506
00:35:28,855 --> 00:35:30,815
she's some 650 feet long

507
00:35:30,815 --> 00:35:33,405
and 32,000 tons
submerged displacement...

508
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:34,905
roughly the same size

509
00:35:34,905 --> 00:35:37,945
as a World War II
aircraft carrier.

510
00:35:37,945 --> 00:35:39,905
We believe that these doors,

511
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:42,915
here on the bow
and again on the stern,

512
00:35:42,915 --> 00:35:44,955
enclose a unique
propulsion system...

513
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:48,085
a magneto-hydrodynamic drive,
or caterpillar,

514
00:35:48,085 --> 00:35:51,625
that would enable the sub
to run virtually silent.

515
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:54,255
It is possible
that this new drive system

516
00:35:54,255 --> 00:35:56,795
allowed the captain,
a man named Ramius,

517
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:59,305
their senior and perhaps
most respected commander...

518
00:35:59,305 --> 00:36:01,305
Do we have
his picture available?

519
00:36:01,305 --> 00:36:04,225
Allowed Ramius to elude
one of our attack boats,

520
00:36:04,225 --> 00:36:09,435
the Dallas, which trailed Red October
from harbor this morning.

521
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:10,935
It is also possible

522
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,445
that this drive system,
if operable,

523
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:15,445
could render the Red October

524
00:36:15,445 --> 00:36:17,985
undetectable to
our Sosus warning nets

525
00:36:17,985 --> 00:36:19,445
in the Atlantic.

526
00:36:19,445 --> 00:36:21,945
Mr. Ryan, would you
characterize this

527
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:26,955
as a first-strike weapon?

528
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:29,495
Uh, that is a possibility, sir.

529
00:36:29,495 --> 00:36:32,005
It is designed
to approach by stealth

530
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:33,465
and to shower its target

531
00:36:33,465 --> 00:36:34,965
with multiple
independent warheads

532
00:36:34,965 --> 00:36:37,175
with little or no warning
before impact.

533
00:36:37,175 --> 00:36:41,635
Goddamn thing's made
to start a war.

534
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:43,175
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

535
00:36:43,175 --> 00:36:46,145
About the same time
the Dallas lost contact,

536
00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:47,685
there were additional sailings

537
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:50,765
from Polijarny and from
Leningrad on the Baltic

538
00:36:50,765 --> 00:36:52,605
and from the Mediterranean.

539
00:36:52,605 --> 00:36:55,355
There are now
some 58 nuclear submarines

540
00:36:55,355 --> 00:36:57,985
headed at high speed
into the Atlantic.

541
00:36:57,985 --> 00:37:00,695
This afternoon a satellite pass
over Polijarny

542
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:03,325
found heat blooms
in the engineering plants

543
00:37:03,325 --> 00:37:05,035
at the Kirov, the Minsk,

544
00:37:05,035 --> 00:37:07,535
and more than 20 other
cruisers and destroyers,

545
00:37:07,535 --> 00:37:09,835
indicating they were
preparing to sail.

546
00:37:09,835 --> 00:37:13,045
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.

547
00:37:13,045 --> 00:37:14,545
Admiral Greer,
your conclusions.

548
00:37:14,545 --> 00:37:15,915
Well, sir,

549
00:37:15,915 --> 00:37:18,885
the data support
no conclusions as yet.

550
00:37:18,885 --> 00:37:21,805
The absence of activity
in the Pacific

551
00:37:21,805 --> 00:37:24,305
suggests this could
be just an exercise.

552
00:37:24,305 --> 00:37:26,345
It may have nothing to do...

553
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,345
Suppose it's not an exercise?

554
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:29,805
Suppose this
is the beginning

555
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:31,315
of a move against NATO?

556
00:37:31,315 --> 00:37:33,315
NSA can speak for that,
Mr. Pelt.

557
00:37:33,315 --> 00:37:36,525
I must emphasize the extreme
sensitivity of this information

558
00:37:36,525 --> 00:37:39,025
and that it not leave the room.

559
00:37:39,025 --> 00:37:40,525
Before sailing, Captain Ramius

560
00:37:40,525 --> 00:37:43,195
sent a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin,

561
00:37:43,195 --> 00:37:44,745
Chairman of the Red Fleet

562
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:46,535
northern political directorate.

563
00:37:46,535 --> 00:37:48,075
That's her uncle.

564
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:49,875
Whose uncle?

565
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:51,415
Ramius' wife.

566
00:37:51,415 --> 00:37:53,545
Padorin's her uncle.

567
00:37:53,545 --> 00:37:57,375
Now, the contents
of the letter are unknown,

568
00:37:57,375 --> 00:38:00,215
but Admiral Padorin
immediately demanded

569
00:38:00,215 --> 00:38:02,425
a meeting
with Premier Chernenko,

570
00:38:02,425 --> 00:38:04,885
and within minutes
of that meeting,

571
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:06,345
the Soviet fleet sailed

572
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:08,885
with orders
to find Red October

573
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:11,725
and sink her.

574
00:38:11,725 --> 00:38:12,895
Sink her?

575
00:38:12,895 --> 00:38:15,395
My God. They've got
a madman on their hands.

576
00:38:15,395 --> 00:38:18,235
If it gets within
500 miles of the coast,

577
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:36,165
we'll have less than
two minutes' warning.

578
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:37,965
Today's the 23rd, isn't it?

579
00:38:37,965 --> 00:38:38,965
What?

580
00:38:38,965 --> 00:38:40,125
Is today the 23rd?

581
00:38:40,125 --> 00:38:51,805
Yeah.

582
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:55,265
You son of a bitch.

583
00:38:55,265 --> 00:39:01,105
You son of a bitch!

584
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,985
You wish to add something

585
00:39:02,985 --> 00:39:10,115
to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

586
00:39:10,115 --> 00:39:12,285
Well, sir,
I was just thinking

587
00:39:12,285 --> 00:39:16,995
that perhaps there's another
possibility we might consider.

588
00:39:16,995 --> 00:39:19,335
Ramius might be
trying to defect.

589
00:39:19,335 --> 00:39:20,505
Do you mean to suggest

590
00:39:20,505 --> 00:39:22,045
that this man has come...

591
00:39:22,045 --> 00:39:26,845
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

592
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,175
Well...

593
00:39:28,175 --> 00:39:30,845
Ramius trained most
of their officer corps,

594
00:39:30,845 --> 00:39:33,345
which would put him
in a position

595
00:39:33,345 --> 00:39:36,355
to select men
willing to help him.

596
00:39:36,355 --> 00:39:38,935
And he's not Russian.

597
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,525
He's Lithuanian by birth,

598
00:39:40,525 --> 00:39:43,525
raised by his paternal
grandfather, a fisherman.

599
00:39:43,525 --> 00:39:50,365
And he has no children,
no ties to leave behind.

600
00:39:50,365 --> 00:39:53,165
And today is
the first anniversary

601
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:54,625
of his wife's death.

602
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,625
Come on.
You're just an analyst.

603
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,875
How can you read his mind?

604
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,545
I know Ramius, General.

605
00:40:00,545 --> 00:40:03,585
He's nearly a legend
in the submarine community.

606
00:40:03,585 --> 00:40:05,885
He's been a maverick
his entire career.

607
00:40:05,885 --> 00:40:08,715
I actually met him once
at an embassy dinner.

608
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:20,105
Have you ever met
Captain Ramius, General?

609
00:40:20,105 --> 00:40:21,565
Admiral Hollis,

610
00:40:21,565 --> 00:40:25,105
how long before Ramius
could be in a position

611
00:40:25,105 --> 00:40:27,615
to fire his missiles at us?

612
00:40:27,615 --> 00:40:28,905
Four days.

613
00:40:28,905 --> 00:40:31,405
All right.
I'll brief the President.

614
00:40:31,405 --> 00:40:33,705
That will be all, gentlemen.

615
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:35,075
Dr Ryan,

616
00:40:35,075 --> 00:40:38,745
would you stay
for a moment, please?

617
00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:53,805
I said speak your mind,
Jack, but Jesus...

618
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:57,645
You slammed the door
on the general pretty hard, Jack.

619
00:40:57,645 --> 00:41:00,145
That was not my intention, sir.

620
00:41:00,145 --> 00:41:01,645
Oh, yes, it was.

621
00:41:01,645 --> 00:41:03,105
He was patronizing you,

622
00:41:03,105 --> 00:41:05,105
and you stomped on him.

623
00:41:05,105 --> 00:41:07,605
In my opinion,
he deserved it.

624
00:41:07,605 --> 00:41:09,775
Listen, I'm a politician,

625
00:41:09,775 --> 00:41:12,285
which means I'm
a cheat and a liar,

626
00:41:12,285 --> 00:41:14,495
and when I'm
not kissing babies,

627
00:41:14,495 --> 00:41:16,115
I'm stealing
their lollipops,

628
00:41:16,115 --> 00:41:21,415
but it also means
that I keep my options open.

629
00:41:21,415 --> 00:41:27,675
So let's assume for a minute
that you're right

630
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:31,305
and this Russian
intends to defect.

631
00:41:31,305 --> 00:41:35,805
What do you suggest
we do about it?

632
00:41:35,805 --> 00:41:37,805
We definitely
grab the boat, sir.

633
00:41:37,805 --> 00:41:39,975
Hey, wait a minute.

634
00:41:39,975 --> 00:41:43,395
We're not talking about
some stray pilot with a M.I.G.

635
00:41:43,395 --> 00:41:45,895
We're talking about several
billion dollars' worth

636
00:41:45,895 --> 00:41:47,395
of Soviet state property.

637
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:49,405
They're going to want it back.

638
00:41:49,405 --> 00:41:50,865
Maybe it's enough then

639
00:41:50,865 --> 00:41:53,905
just to get some people
on board and inspect it.

640
00:41:53,905 --> 00:41:55,905
Call it whatever
you want to...

641
00:41:55,905 --> 00:41:57,955
a Coast Guard
safety inspection.

642
00:41:57,955 --> 00:42:00,745
So how do we proceed?

643
00:42:00,745 --> 00:42:02,205
First, we need to contact

644
00:42:02,205 --> 00:42:05,205
the commanders
in the Atlantic directly.

645
00:42:05,205 --> 00:42:07,215
The Russians get
one whiff of this

646
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:08,925
through the regular
communications circuits,

647
00:42:08,925 --> 00:42:10,425
the game is up.

648
00:42:10,425 --> 00:42:13,425
Second, we figure out
how we can help them.

649
00:42:13,425 --> 00:42:15,425
We devise a plan to intercede,

650
00:42:15,425 --> 00:42:17,935
ready to go at a moment's notice.

651
00:42:17,935 --> 00:42:21,015
Third, somebody's got to
go make contact with Ramius

652
00:42:21,015 --> 00:42:23,855
and find out what
his intentions really are.

653
00:42:23,855 --> 00:42:25,145
OK.

654
00:42:25,145 --> 00:42:26,605
When do you leave?

655
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:28,145
Ha ha ha!

656
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:31,485
Wait a minute.

657
00:42:31,485 --> 00:42:32,985
The general was right.

658
00:42:32,985 --> 00:42:34,445
I am not field personnel.

659
00:42:34,445 --> 00:42:35,945
I am only an analyst.

660
00:42:35,945 --> 00:42:37,115
You're perfect.

661
00:42:37,115 --> 00:42:39,995
I can't ask any
of these characters to go.

662
00:42:39,995 --> 00:42:41,495
They don't believe in it.

663
00:42:41,495 --> 00:42:43,125
They'd never stake
their reputation

664
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,625
on a hunch, whereas you...

665
00:42:44,625 --> 00:42:48,505
Are expendable.

666
00:42:48,505 --> 00:42:53,465
Something like that.

667
00:42:53,465 --> 00:42:55,505
I'll give you three days

668
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:57,465
to prove your theory correct.

669
00:42:57,465 --> 00:42:58,975
After that,

670
00:42:58,975 --> 00:43:02,475
I have to hunt down Ramius
and destroy him.

671
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:20,865
Will you do it?

672
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:22,915
Mother of God!

673
00:43:22,915 --> 00:43:24,535
Secure the mast!

674
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:26,035
All ahead, 2/3!

675
00:43:26,035 --> 00:43:27,545
Set depth to 900 meters!

676
00:43:27,545 --> 00:43:29,545
What is it?
What's happened?

677
00:43:29,545 --> 00:43:33,215
Mast secured, helm at 2/3.

678
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:35,675
Commence heading 2-0-5.

679
00:43:35,675 --> 00:43:51,445
2-0-5, affirmative.

680
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:54,355
These orders
are seven bloody hours old!

681
00:43:54,355 --> 00:43:55,905
Sitting on the bottom

682
00:43:55,905 --> 00:43:57,365
Like an addled schoolboy.

683
00:43:57,365 --> 00:43:58,405
Captain...

684
00:43:58,405 --> 00:43:59,405
Passing at...

685
00:43:59,405 --> 00:44:00,535
All ahead, flank.

686
00:44:00,535 --> 00:44:01,705
All ahead, flank.

687
00:44:01,705 --> 00:44:07,535
Inquire of the engineer
about the possibility

688
00:44:07,535 --> 00:44:09,545
Seven hours.

689
00:44:09,545 --> 00:44:21,175
The entire fleet is after him.

690
00:44:21,175 --> 00:44:22,765
Leveling at 900 meters.

691
00:44:22,765 --> 00:44:23,935
Very well.

692
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:28,435
Captain, Engineer reports

693
00:44:28,435 --> 00:44:40,905
but not recommended.

694
00:44:40,905 --> 00:44:46,455
Go to 105 on the reactor.

695
00:44:46,455 --> 00:44:47,915
Captain, what is it?

696
00:44:47,915 --> 00:44:49,415
Where are we going?

697
00:44:49,415 --> 00:44:52,875
We're going to
kill a friend, Yevgeni.

698
00:44:52,875 --> 00:45:17,235
We're going to kill Ramius.

699
00:45:17,235 --> 00:45:18,735
If you like borscht,
perhaps,

700
00:45:18,735 --> 00:45:21,195
but I've eaten better
in an oiler's galley.

701
00:45:21,195 --> 00:45:23,155
My wife said to the waiter,

702
00:45:23,155 --> 00:45:25,705
"Where did this man
learn to cook,

703
00:45:25,705 --> 00:45:26,705
Afghanistan?"

704
00:45:26,705 --> 00:45:29,535
So then we went
on to the Bolshoi,

705
00:45:29,535 --> 00:45:30,835
the ballet,

706
00:45:30,835 --> 00:45:33,085
to see this new girl
as Giselle.

707
00:45:33,085 --> 00:45:34,715
You remember
how beautiful she was.

708
00:45:34,715 --> 00:45:36,715
She just married
a factory manager.

709
00:45:36,715 --> 00:45:38,215
Excuse me, Doctor.

710
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:40,215
Do you have the figures

711
00:45:40,215 --> 00:45:43,215
for the latest batch
of radiation tests?

712
00:45:43,215 --> 00:45:45,225
Now?

713
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:48,225
Now.

714
00:45:48,225 --> 00:45:52,725
Perhaps you could bring
the preceding set as well...

715
00:45:52,725 --> 00:45:55,235
for comparison.

716
00:45:55,235 --> 00:46:14,755
Thank you, Doctor.

717
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:18,425
It will take him some time.

718
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:21,095
Before we begin, Captain,

719
00:46:21,095 --> 00:46:22,595
I'd like to know

720
00:46:22,595 --> 00:46:29,595
exactly what happened
to Putin.

721
00:46:29,595 --> 00:46:33,765
He didn't slip
on his tea, did he?

722
00:46:33,765 --> 00:46:36,275
I don't think I like
your tone, Slavin.

723
00:46:36,275 --> 00:46:39,775
What the hell's my tone
got to do with it?

724
00:46:39,775 --> 00:46:41,275
We're risking our lives here.

725
00:46:41,275 --> 00:46:43,775
Putin could've caused
complications.

726
00:46:43,775 --> 00:46:46,285
Did you think he would
just go away and sulk

727
00:46:46,285 --> 00:46:48,285
while we carried out our plans?

728
00:46:48,285 --> 00:46:50,615
Are you saying
he was murdered?

729
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:52,285
My God.

730
00:46:52,285 --> 00:46:53,785
Stop whining, Yuri.

731
00:46:53,785 --> 00:46:55,295
How can you justify murder?

732
00:46:55,295 --> 00:46:56,795
So he was murdered.

733
00:46:56,795 --> 00:46:59,005
The man was a pig,

734
00:46:59,005 --> 00:47:01,835
but it's a decision
we should've all made together.

735
00:47:01,835 --> 00:47:03,345
You are not in command here.

736
00:47:03,345 --> 00:47:06,305
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.

737
00:47:06,305 --> 00:47:07,885
What are you talking about?

738
00:47:07,885 --> 00:47:09,345
They could kill us all.

739
00:47:09,345 --> 00:47:12,395
Everything that happens
on this ship affects us all.

740
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:14,855
The Master-At-Arms
is already suspicious.

741
00:47:14,855 --> 00:47:16,355
We could still go back.

742
00:47:16,355 --> 00:47:20,695
There will be no going back.

743
00:47:20,695 --> 00:47:22,155
Before we sailed,

744
00:47:22,155 --> 00:47:26,485
I dispatched a letter
to Admiral Padorin,

745
00:47:26,485 --> 00:47:29,155
in which I announced
our intention...

746
00:47:29,155 --> 00:47:32,285
to defect.

747
00:47:32,285 --> 00:47:35,285
In the name of God, why?

748
00:47:35,285 --> 00:47:37,795
When he reached the New World,

749
00:47:37,795 --> 00:47:40,295
Cortez burned his ships.

750
00:47:40,295 --> 00:47:43,925
As a result, his men
were well motivated.

751
00:47:43,925 --> 00:47:46,805
You have signed
our death warrants.

752
00:47:46,805 --> 00:47:49,845
Padorin will send
the entire fleet.

753
00:47:49,845 --> 00:47:51,305
Jesus, they'll find us.

754
00:47:51,305 --> 00:47:52,685
They'll find us and...

755
00:47:52,685 --> 00:47:54,515
No one's going to find us.

756
00:47:54,515 --> 00:47:57,315
That's enough, Yuri.

757
00:47:57,315 --> 00:47:59,025
You had to do it, huh?

758
00:47:59,025 --> 00:48:02,025
You couldn't just
turn the submarine over

759
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,525
to the Americans.

760
00:48:03,525 --> 00:48:06,525
You had to make
a political statement.

761
00:48:06,525 --> 00:48:10,155
Or was it something
deeper, Captain...

762
00:48:10,155 --> 00:48:14,035
something that made you
unable to slip away?

763
00:48:14,035 --> 00:48:16,875
Was it ego, Captain?

764
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:19,875
We each have
our reasons, Victor.

765
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,335
My own began

766
00:48:21,335 --> 00:48:25,385
the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship...

767
00:48:25,385 --> 00:48:28,385
a ship which had but one use.

768
00:48:28,385 --> 00:48:30,345
And as for the rest,

769
00:48:30,345 --> 00:48:33,345
well, those are things
that I alone

770
00:48:33,345 --> 00:48:35,345
must carry the burden for.

771
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:39,895
Anatoli,
you're afraid of our fleet.

772
00:48:39,895 --> 00:48:41,815
Well, you should be.

773
00:48:41,815 --> 00:48:49,865
Personally, I give us
one chance in three.

774
00:48:49,865 --> 00:48:54,995
More tea, anyone?

775
00:48:54,995 --> 00:48:57,875
No?

776
00:48:57,875 --> 00:49:17,935
Then you may report
back to your posts.

777
00:49:17,935 --> 00:49:29,945
You heard the Captain.
Dismissed.

778
00:49:29,945 --> 00:49:43,415
Captain.

779
00:49:43,415 --> 00:49:45,965
Captain, I would never
disagree with you

780
00:49:45,965 --> 00:49:48,925
in front of the men,
you know that.

781
00:49:48,925 --> 00:49:53,265
But in this case,
Victor is right.

782
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:54,805
It would've been better

783
00:49:54,805 --> 00:49:57,265
if you had not informed Moscow.

784
00:49:57,265 --> 00:49:58,475
Oh, Vasily.

785
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:01,145
Moscow is not the worry,

786
00:50:01,145 --> 00:50:03,815
nor the whole Soviet Navy.

787
00:50:03,815 --> 00:50:06,315
I know their tactics.

788
00:50:06,315 --> 00:50:10,315
I have the advantage.

789
00:50:10,315 --> 00:50:12,485
No.

790
00:50:12,485 --> 00:50:16,325
The worry is the Americans.

791
00:50:16,325 --> 00:50:19,165
If we meet the right sort,

792
00:50:19,165 --> 00:50:23,835
this will work.

793
00:50:23,835 --> 00:50:32,345
We get some buckaroo...

794
00:50:32,345 --> 00:50:34,845
Some turbulence,
eh, Commander?

795
00:50:34,845 --> 00:50:37,345
You don't like flying, huh?

796
00:50:37,345 --> 00:50:38,845
Oh, this is nothing!

797
00:50:38,845 --> 00:50:40,345
You should've been with us

798
00:50:40,345 --> 00:50:41,855
five, six months ago!

799
00:50:41,855 --> 00:50:43,475
Oh! You talk about puke!

800
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:46,485
We ran into a hailstorm
over the sea of Japan, right?

801
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:48,735
Everybody's retching
their guts out!

802
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:50,855
The pilot shot his lunch

803
00:50:50,855 --> 00:50:51,865
all over the windshield,

804
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:54,365
and I barf on the radio!

805
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:55,535
Knocked it out completely,

806
00:50:55,535 --> 00:50:57,575
and it wasn't
that lightweight stuff either!

807
00:50:57,575 --> 00:51:00,165
It was that chunky,
industrial-weight puke!

808
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:01,705
You want a bite?

809
00:51:01,705 --> 00:51:04,745
Jack, next time
you get a bright idea,

810
00:51:04,745 --> 00:51:16,215
just put it in a memo.

811
00:51:16,215 --> 00:51:18,765
Sir.

812
00:51:18,765 --> 00:51:21,395
That'll be all, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

813
00:51:21,395 --> 00:51:23,435
That hawkeye
from Weymouth Trap?

814
00:51:23,435 --> 00:51:24,395
Four wire.

815
00:51:24,395 --> 00:51:26,935
Caught a gust over the fantail.

816
00:51:26,935 --> 00:51:28,395
Well, not bad, considering.

817
00:51:28,395 --> 00:51:31,445
The gentleman
is here to see you.

818
00:51:31,445 --> 00:51:32,565
The gentleman?

819
00:51:32,565 --> 00:51:34,405
What the hell
you talking about, Charlie?

820
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:36,365
I apologize
for the uniform, sir.

821
00:51:36,365 --> 00:51:38,035
This is Admiral Greer's idea

822
00:51:38,035 --> 00:51:39,495
of a low profile.

823
00:51:39,495 --> 00:51:41,455
You work for Jim Greer?

824
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:42,995
That's right, sir.

825
00:51:42,995 --> 00:51:45,455
Then I imagine you'll tell me

826
00:51:45,455 --> 00:51:48,375
what all the hubbub's about.

827
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,375
Captain, you got a minute?

828
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:51,875
Jonesy's got something

829
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,835
I think you ought to see.

830
00:51:53,835 --> 00:51:56,215
Martinez, get yourself
a cup of coffee.

831
00:51:56,215 --> 00:51:57,965
Send me up some tea.

832
00:51:57,965 --> 00:51:59,015
Aye, Captain.

833
00:51:59,015 --> 00:52:04,935
Messenger,
get the captain a cup of tea.

834
00:52:04,935 --> 00:52:07,895
Captain.

835
00:52:07,895 --> 00:52:10,895
Sir, the moment
that sub went silent

836
00:52:10,895 --> 00:52:13,355
and I thought I
heard some singing,

837
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:15,905
I heard something
in the background real faint.

838
00:52:15,905 --> 00:52:17,905
After all those subs took off,

839
00:52:17,905 --> 00:52:21,405
I caught it again
and got it on tape.

840
00:52:21,405 --> 00:52:23,415
I washed it through the computer

841
00:52:23,415 --> 00:52:27,915
and was able to
isolate this sound.

842
00:52:27,915 --> 00:52:30,415
When I asked the computer
to identify it,

843
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:32,925
what I got was
magma displacement.

844
00:52:32,925 --> 00:52:35,425
You see, sir,
the SAPS software

845
00:52:35,425 --> 00:52:38,425
was originally written
to look for seismic events.

846
00:52:38,425 --> 00:52:40,465
I think when it gets confused,

847
00:52:40,465 --> 00:52:42,765
it kind of runs home to Mama.

848
00:52:42,765 --> 00:52:44,225
I'm not following you,
Jonesy.

849
00:52:44,225 --> 00:52:45,805
Sir, I'm sorry.

850
00:52:45,805 --> 00:52:56,485
Listen to it
at 10 times speed.

851
00:52:56,485 --> 00:52:59,865
Now, that's got to
be manmade, Captain.

852
00:52:59,865 --> 00:53:02,995
All right.

853
00:53:02,995 --> 00:53:05,495
The first contact was at 09:15,

854
00:53:05,495 --> 00:53:07,495
and the bearing was 2-6-9.

855
00:53:07,495 --> 00:53:09,545
At 09:30, it was here.

856
00:53:09,545 --> 00:53:13,045
I came back to it at 11:00
and 11:15, here and here.

857
00:53:13,045 --> 00:53:15,045
Remember the dispatch we got

858
00:53:15,045 --> 00:53:16,425
about Russian sub skippers

859
00:53:16,425 --> 00:53:19,005
running the Reykjanes Ridge
at high speeds

860
00:53:19,005 --> 00:53:20,925
because they had
hyper-accurate surveys

861
00:53:20,925 --> 00:53:22,465
of the underwater canyons?

862
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,435
The front door to those canyons

863
00:53:24,435 --> 00:53:26,935
was a formation
called Thor's Twins.

864
00:53:26,935 --> 00:53:40,945
Yeah?

865
00:53:40,945 --> 00:53:44,825
Look at that.

866
00:53:44,825 --> 00:53:46,495
Right into Red Route One.

867
00:53:46,495 --> 00:53:48,955
Captain.

868
00:53:48,955 --> 00:53:50,455
You may think I'm crazy,

869
00:53:50,455 --> 00:53:52,455
but I'll bet that
magma displacement

870
00:53:52,455 --> 00:53:54,965
was actually some
new Russian sub,

871
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:59,465
and it's headed
for the Iceland coast.

872
00:53:59,465 --> 00:54:02,005
Have I got this straight,
Jonesy?

873
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,975
A $40 million computer tells you
you're chasing an earthquake,

874
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:07,475
but you don't believe it,

875
00:54:07,475 --> 00:54:10,975
and you come up
with this on your own?

876
00:54:10,975 --> 00:54:12,145
Yes, sir.

877
00:54:12,145 --> 00:54:13,645
Including all the navigation math?

878
00:54:13,645 --> 00:54:15,185
Sir, I've got all the...

879
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:18,655
Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.

880
00:54:18,655 --> 00:54:22,655
Tommy, I want you
to plot us a speed course

881
00:54:22,655 --> 00:54:25,655
for the bottom end
of Red Route One.

882
00:54:25,655 --> 00:54:27,825
We'll never find him
in those canyons.

883
00:54:27,825 --> 00:54:30,165
First take us
to periscope depth.

884
00:54:30,165 --> 00:54:31,415
This we got to phone in.

885
00:54:31,415 --> 00:54:42,215
Aye, aye, Captain.

886
00:54:42,215 --> 00:54:48,685
Hang on, Jonesy.

887
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:51,515
If I can get you close enough,

888
00:54:51,515 --> 00:54:53,105
can you track this sucker?

889
00:54:53,105 --> 00:54:54,855
Yes, sir.

890
00:54:54,855 --> 00:54:57,855
Now that I know
what to listen for,

891
00:54:57,855 --> 00:55:00,525
I'll bag him.

892
00:55:00,525 --> 00:55:01,695
Carry on.

893
00:55:01,695 --> 00:55:04,485
Yes, sir.

894
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:06,745
That's the craziest notion
I've ever heard...

895
00:55:06,745 --> 00:55:07,905
a serving line officer?

896
00:55:07,905 --> 00:55:09,915
An entire ballistic
missile submarine?

897
00:55:09,915 --> 00:55:11,455
They can't all want to defect.

898
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:13,415
Even if it's only the officers,

899
00:55:13,415 --> 00:55:14,955
it's extremely
difficult to believe.

900
00:55:14,955 --> 00:55:16,415
What's his plan?

901
00:55:16,415 --> 00:55:17,665
His plan?

902
00:55:17,665 --> 00:55:20,175
Russians don't take a dump, son,

903
00:55:20,175 --> 00:55:22,135
without a plan.

904
00:55:22,135 --> 00:55:24,965
Senior captains don't start
something this dangerous

905
00:55:24,965 --> 00:55:26,715
without having thought
the matter through.

906
00:55:26,715 --> 00:55:27,885
What's he going to do,

907
00:55:27,885 --> 00:55:31,095
sail into New York, pop the hatch,
and say here I am?

908
00:55:31,095 --> 00:55:33,145
It might be just
that simple, yes.

909
00:55:33,145 --> 00:55:35,355
Things may appear simple
in the cubicle at CIA,

910
00:55:35,355 --> 00:55:37,685
but in the middle
of the Atlantic

911
00:55:37,685 --> 00:55:40,145
with Soviet warships
bearing down on us,

912
00:55:40,145 --> 00:55:41,525
they get more complex.

913
00:55:41,525 --> 00:55:42,565
Smoke?

914
00:55:42,565 --> 00:55:44,735
No, thank you.

915
00:55:44,735 --> 00:55:46,615
And I don't think your notion

916
00:55:46,615 --> 00:55:49,115
of a few days inspection's
going to wash either.

917
00:55:49,115 --> 00:55:51,615
In order to be of any value,

918
00:55:51,615 --> 00:55:53,165
you'd have to tear it apart.

919
00:55:53,165 --> 00:55:54,835
The metallurgy would
take a couple of months.

920
00:55:54,835 --> 00:55:56,165
Then we'd have to keep it.

921
00:55:56,165 --> 00:55:59,665
What will you do with the crew?

922
00:55:59,665 --> 00:56:04,005
Ones that don't defect will go back
and say we got the boat.

923
00:56:04,005 --> 00:56:07,255
Or do you plan
to eliminate them?

924
00:56:07,255 --> 00:56:09,345
We're not at war, sir.

925
00:56:09,345 --> 00:56:13,515
So you have to get them
off the boat in such a way

926
00:56:13,515 --> 00:56:15,515
that they think we don't have it,

927
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:19,105
and they'll report that
we don't have it to their bosses.

928
00:56:19,105 --> 00:56:20,525
Otherwise, this whole business

929
00:56:20,525 --> 00:56:24,025
is just academic, right?

930
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:28,575
Yes, sir.
I think I see your point.

931
00:56:28,575 --> 00:56:33,075
When's the last time you slept?

932
00:56:33,075 --> 00:56:35,535
A while.

933
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:38,205
The chief outside
will fix you up.

934
00:56:38,205 --> 00:56:39,755
Thank you, sir.

935
00:56:39,755 --> 00:56:46,215
Captain.

936
00:56:46,215 --> 00:56:48,715
It'll be dawn
in a couple of hours.

937
00:56:48,715 --> 00:56:50,135
We'll be in the CIC.

938
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:54,685
Things are liable to get
a little dicey around here.

939
00:56:54,685 --> 00:57:03,895
Yes, sir.

940
00:57:03,895 --> 00:57:05,775
You think he's crazy?

941
00:57:05,775 --> 00:57:07,025
Certifiable.

942
00:57:07,025 --> 00:57:08,735
No matter what
his credentials,

943
00:57:08,735 --> 00:57:11,695
I don't care for him
wearing the uniform.

944
00:57:11,695 --> 00:57:14,115
Did you see that ring
on his finger?

945
00:57:14,115 --> 00:57:17,125
The academy, class of '72.
A marine.

946
00:57:17,125 --> 00:57:18,285
You're kidding.

947
00:57:18,285 --> 00:57:19,835
How did you...

948
00:57:19,835 --> 00:57:21,295
Greer told me.

949
00:57:21,295 --> 00:57:23,045
Summer of his third year,

950
00:57:23,045 --> 00:57:25,505
he went down
in a chopper accident.

951
00:57:25,505 --> 00:57:27,505
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

952
00:57:27,505 --> 00:57:30,505
That kid spent
10 months in traction

953
00:57:30,505 --> 00:57:33,555
and another year
learning to walk again.

954
00:57:33,555 --> 00:57:37,185
He did his fourth year
from the hospital.

955
00:57:37,185 --> 00:57:39,185
It's up to you, Charlie,

956
00:57:39,185 --> 00:57:43,065
but you might consider
cutting the kid a little slack.

957
00:57:43,065 --> 00:57:46,025
Ah, Russians are
going to find that sub

958
00:57:46,025 --> 00:58:10,545
before we get near it anyway.

959
00:58:10,545 --> 00:58:13,095
Passing Thor's Twins, sir.

960
00:58:13,095 --> 00:58:19,305
Very good.

961
00:58:19,305 --> 00:58:21,265
Passing the twins now,
Captain.

962
00:58:21,265 --> 00:58:23,225
Very good.
You may commence your run.

963
00:58:23,225 --> 00:58:25,235
Call me at the first turning.

964
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:26,775
Aye, Captain.

965
00:58:26,775 --> 00:58:29,405
Mr. Kamarov.

966
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:31,445
You may commence your run now.

967
00:58:31,445 --> 00:58:32,445
Aye, sir.

968
00:58:32,445 --> 00:58:35,995
First leg on my mark,
course 2-6-0.

969
00:58:35,995 --> 00:58:40,455
Speed, 18 knots.
Depth, 270 meters.

970
00:58:40,455 --> 00:58:41,995
5...

971
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:43,045
4...

972
00:58:43,045 --> 00:58:44,125
3...

973
00:58:44,125 --> 00:58:45,125
2...

974
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:46,545
1...

975
00:58:46,545 --> 00:58:48,085
Mark.

976
00:58:48,085 --> 00:58:50,635
Diving command, course 2-6-0.

977
00:58:50,635 --> 00:58:52,135
Course 2-6-0, aye.

978
00:58:52,135 --> 00:58:53,305
Speed, 18 knots.

979
00:58:53,305 --> 00:58:54,805
Speed, 18 knots, aye.

980
00:58:54,805 --> 00:58:56,305
Stop pissing, Yuri.

981
00:58:56,305 --> 00:58:58,635
Give me a stopwatch and a map,

982
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:00,145
and I'll fly the Alps

983
00:59:00,145 --> 00:59:01,645
in a plane with no windows.

984
00:59:01,645 --> 00:59:25,295
If the map is accurate enough.

985
00:59:25,295 --> 00:59:28,295
We're in the lane
and approaching first turn.

986
00:59:28,295 --> 00:59:32,675
Come left to course 1-9-5.

987
00:59:32,675 --> 00:59:34,675
In 30 seconds,

988
00:59:34,675 --> 00:59:36,635
decrease depth to 200 meters.

989
00:59:36,635 --> 00:59:38,175
Maintain speed.

990
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:41,645
Very good, Navigator.

991
00:59:41,645 --> 00:59:44,185
Captain, we're approaching
the first turn.

992
00:59:44,185 --> 00:59:46,645
25 seconds to course 1-9-5.

993
00:59:46,645 --> 00:59:52,655
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.

994
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,655
Aye, Captain.

995
00:59:55,655 --> 01:00:00,205
Navigator, recompute
for 26 knots.

996
01:00:00,205 --> 01:00:02,205
Turn on my mark.

997
01:00:02,205 --> 01:00:07,665
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

998
01:00:07,665 --> 01:00:08,665
Mark.

999
01:00:08,665 --> 01:00:10,665
Diving control,
come left to 1-9-5.

1000
01:00:10,665 --> 01:00:12,175
Come left to 1-9-5.

1001
01:00:12,175 --> 01:00:21,265
Up on the bow planes.

1002
01:00:21,265 --> 01:00:23,095
Course now 1-9-5

1003
01:00:23,095 --> 01:00:30,485
and maintaining speed
26 knots.

1004
01:00:30,485 --> 01:00:32,485
Mr. Kamarov?

1005
01:00:32,485 --> 01:00:34,445
Next leg, Captain,

1006
01:00:34,445 --> 01:00:38,945
come right
to course 2-4-0 now at...

1007
01:00:38,945 --> 01:00:40,995
8 minutes and 40 seconds.

1008
01:00:40,995 --> 01:00:47,455
Very good.
Maintain course and speed.

1009
01:00:47,455 --> 01:00:49,455
Too fast, Vasily.

1010
01:00:49,455 --> 01:00:50,505
Too fast.

1011
01:00:50,505 --> 01:00:53,465
Those charts are
laid out precisely...

1012
01:00:53,465 --> 01:00:56,465
so many knots
for so many seconds.

1013
01:00:56,465 --> 01:00:58,965
And this thing
handles like a pig.

1014
01:00:58,965 --> 01:01:07,725
Watch your bearing,
Mr. Slavin.

1015
01:01:07,725 --> 01:01:09,975
15 seconds to turn, Captain.

1016
01:01:09,975 --> 01:01:11,645
Should we decrease speed?

1017
01:01:11,645 --> 01:01:12,685
Negative.

1018
01:01:12,685 --> 01:01:15,155
Prepare to come right.

1019
01:01:15,155 --> 01:01:16,365
Aye, sir.

1020
01:01:16,365 --> 01:01:17,365
8...

1021
01:01:17,365 --> 01:01:18,485
7...

1022
01:01:18,485 --> 01:01:19,485
6...

1023
01:01:19,485 --> 01:01:20,535
5...

1024
01:01:20,535 --> 01:01:21,535
4...

1025
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,535
3...

1026
01:01:22,535 --> 01:01:23,495
2...

1027
01:01:23,495 --> 01:01:24,995
1...Mark.

1028
01:01:24,995 --> 01:01:27,535
15 degrees down angle
on the bow planes.

1029
01:01:27,535 --> 01:01:29,835
Come right 2-4-0.

1030
01:01:29,835 --> 01:01:50,565
Move it!

1031
01:01:50,565 --> 01:01:52,025
We're in the lane.

1032
01:01:52,025 --> 01:01:55,195
Next leg 34 minutes
to the Neptune Massif.

1033
01:01:55,195 --> 01:02:10,625
Course 2-4-0.

1034
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:12,915
What happened?

1035
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:14,375
The cryogenic plant!

1036
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:15,875
The magnets aren't cooling.

1037
01:02:15,875 --> 01:02:17,375
Temperature in
the caterpillar

1038
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:20,385
is 15 degrees above red line
and rising.

1039
01:02:20,385 --> 01:02:21,885
It's going to melt.

1040
01:02:21,885 --> 01:02:28,595
Kill it! Shut it down!

1041
01:02:28,595 --> 01:02:30,105
Captain?

1042
01:02:30,105 --> 01:02:31,065
What happened?

1043
01:02:31,065 --> 01:02:33,065
The cryogenic plant failed.

1044
01:02:33,065 --> 01:02:35,395
Reactor damage?

1045
01:02:35,395 --> 01:02:37,065
There was a power spike,

1046
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:38,945
but the reactor
scrammed automatically.

1047
01:02:38,945 --> 01:02:41,025
Was there any
radiation leakage?

1048
01:02:41,025 --> 01:02:42,575
I don't know yet!

1049
01:02:42,575 --> 01:02:44,745
How long will it take to fix?

1050
01:02:44,745 --> 01:02:47,075
I got to find
what's wrong first.

1051
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:51,455
Could be the liquid helium
or the superconductors.

1052
01:02:51,455 --> 01:02:53,085
Captain, we will have to stop

1053
01:02:53,085 --> 01:02:55,585
until we can repair
the caterpillar unit.

1054
01:02:55,585 --> 01:02:59,635
Negative.
We'll run on normal propulsion.

1055
01:02:59,635 --> 01:03:02,095
Captain,
we will not be silent.

1056
01:03:02,095 --> 01:03:04,215
Make revolutions for 20 knots

1057
01:03:04,215 --> 01:03:10,595
and engage the propellers.

1058
01:03:10,595 --> 01:03:12,145
Aye, Captain.

1059
01:03:12,145 --> 01:03:13,765
Commence engine start-up.

1060
01:03:13,765 --> 01:03:21,115
He'll get us all killed.

1061
01:03:21,115 --> 01:03:24,615
The captain knows
what he's doing.

1062
01:03:24,615 --> 01:03:28,785
Doctor.

1063
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,665
Naval activities?

1064
01:03:30,665 --> 01:03:32,955
I have no knowledge of this.

1065
01:03:32,955 --> 01:03:35,375
But then,
I never was a sailor.

1066
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:37,205
Mr. Ambassador,

1067
01:03:37,205 --> 01:03:39,715
you have nearly
100 vessels operating

1068
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,795
in the North Atlantic
right now.

1069
01:03:41,795 --> 01:03:43,925
Your aircraft have dropped
enough sonar buoys

1070
01:03:43,925 --> 01:03:47,265
that a man could walk
from Greenland to Scotland

1071
01:03:47,265 --> 01:03:49,095
without getting his feet wet.

1072
01:03:49,095 --> 01:03:51,055
Shall we dispense with the bull?

1073
01:03:51,055 --> 01:03:52,555
You make your point

1074
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:56,815
as delicately as ever,
Mr. Pelt, but...

1075
01:03:56,815 --> 01:03:59,185
And what looks like an exercise

1076
01:03:59,185 --> 01:04:01,155
could be a prelude to war.

1077
01:04:01,155 --> 01:04:02,565
How can we tell the difference?

1078
01:04:02,565 --> 01:04:06,575
Prudence demands that we
deploy ships to observe yours.

1079
01:04:06,575 --> 01:04:08,155
Your government should consider

1080
01:04:08,155 --> 01:04:11,665
that having
your ships and ours,

1081
01:04:11,665 --> 01:04:13,665
your aircraft and ours,

1082
01:04:13,665 --> 01:04:18,165
in such proximity
is inherently dangerous.

1083
01:04:18,165 --> 01:04:30,555
Wars have begun that way,
Mr. Ambassador.

1084
01:04:30,555 --> 01:04:33,555
We have lost
one of our submarines.

1085
01:04:33,555 --> 01:04:34,555
Lost it?

1086
01:04:34,555 --> 01:04:37,565
We fear she may be down, and...

1087
01:04:37,565 --> 01:04:39,185
this is most embarrassing, but...

1088
01:04:39,185 --> 01:04:42,695
several of the officers
are sons of...

1089
01:04:42,695 --> 01:04:46,115
high party officials.

1090
01:04:46,115 --> 01:04:48,115
One is even the son

1091
01:04:48,115 --> 01:04:50,115
of a Central Committee member.

1092
01:04:50,115 --> 01:04:52,035
I cannot say which.

1093
01:04:52,035 --> 01:04:56,245
You're telling me this is
a massive rescue operation?

1094
01:04:56,245 --> 01:05:00,205
That is correct.

1095
01:05:00,205 --> 01:05:03,255
I'm terribly sorry.

1096
01:05:03,255 --> 01:05:07,255
How can we help?

1097
01:05:07,255 --> 01:05:08,965
I'm not sure that...

1098
01:05:08,965 --> 01:05:14,725
Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

1099
01:05:14,725 --> 01:05:17,765
That is very gracious of you, sir.

1100
01:05:17,765 --> 01:05:20,725
I'll pass your offer on.

1101
01:05:20,725 --> 01:05:22,235
But at this time,

1102
01:05:22,235 --> 01:05:24,235
I think we're doing everything

1103
01:05:24,235 --> 01:05:43,795
that can be done.

1104
01:05:43,795 --> 01:05:49,005
Captain?

1105
01:05:49,005 --> 01:05:51,885
Our strategy depends
on your answer.

1106
01:05:51,885 --> 01:05:54,885
The entire fleet
will know where we are.

1107
01:05:54,885 --> 01:05:56,095
Captain, Sonar.

1108
01:05:56,095 --> 01:05:59,435
We've been overflown
by a multi-engine turboprop.

1109
01:05:59,435 --> 01:06:04,895
Put it on audio.

1110
01:06:04,895 --> 01:06:08,065
Short transients,
close aboard.

1111
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:10,115
Water entry of small objects.

1112
01:06:10,115 --> 01:06:13,285
Sonar buoys.

1113
01:06:13,285 --> 01:06:14,285
Battle stations.

1114
01:06:14,285 --> 01:06:15,955
Battle stations!

1115
01:06:15,955 --> 01:06:16,955
Battle stations!

1116
01:06:16,955 --> 01:06:17,955
Battle stations!

1117
01:06:17,955 --> 01:06:21,995
How long to Neptune Massif?

1118
01:06:21,995 --> 01:06:23,455
How long?

1119
01:06:23,455 --> 01:06:26,875
4 minutes, 10 seconds.

1120
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,465
Should we bottom the boat?

1121
01:06:28,465 --> 01:06:30,005
No. Too late now.

1122
01:06:30,005 --> 01:06:32,805
We've run out of time.

1123
01:06:32,805 --> 01:06:33,885
Countermeasures.

1124
01:06:33,885 --> 01:06:35,345
Prepare to launch missiles.

1125
01:06:35,345 --> 01:06:45,235
Aye, sir.

1126
01:06:45,235 --> 01:06:46,775
Aircraft on computer guidance.

1127
01:06:46,775 --> 01:06:48,485
Request permission to launch.

1128
01:06:48,485 --> 01:06:53,865
You are authorized
to launch the weapon.

1129
01:06:53,865 --> 01:06:59,745
Weapon is away.

1130
01:06:59,745 --> 01:07:01,245
High speed screw!

1131
01:07:01,245 --> 01:07:02,915
Torpedo in the water!

1132
01:07:02,915 --> 01:07:05,795
Stand by.

1133
01:07:05,795 --> 01:07:09,755
Torpedo is active.

1134
01:07:09,755 --> 01:07:11,925
Torpedo has acquired.

1135
01:07:11,925 --> 01:07:13,755
Launch countermeasures.

1136
01:07:13,755 --> 01:07:21,725
Launch countermeasures.
Aye, sir.

1137
01:07:21,725 --> 01:07:23,185
We're in the lane.

1138
01:07:23,185 --> 01:07:26,105
How long till
the turn at Massif?

1139
01:07:26,105 --> 01:07:27,275
2 minutes, 9 seconds.

1140
01:07:27,275 --> 01:07:30,445
We have no room to maneuver
in these canyons.

1141
01:07:30,445 --> 01:07:36,825
Shut up.

1142
01:07:36,825 --> 01:07:39,285
Torpedo has reached
countermeasures.

1143
01:07:39,285 --> 01:07:40,785
Torpedo has lost contact.

1144
01:07:40,785 --> 01:07:45,625
Massif approaching.

1145
01:07:45,625 --> 01:07:47,965
Torpedo has reacquired.

1146
01:07:47,965 --> 01:07:51,835
Torpedo has reacquired
and is homing.

1147
01:07:51,835 --> 01:07:53,345
Give me the count.

1148
01:07:53,345 --> 01:07:56,805
Turn at Massif 40 degrees starboard
in 30 seconds.

1149
01:07:56,805 --> 01:07:58,925
Time to torpedo impact?

1150
01:07:58,925 --> 01:08:01,055
Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.

1151
01:08:01,055 --> 01:08:02,805
Increase to flank.

1152
01:08:02,805 --> 01:08:03,805
Full ahead flank.

1153
01:08:03,805 --> 01:08:05,015
Full ahead flank.

1154
01:08:05,015 --> 01:08:06,315
Full ahead flank, aye.

1155
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:09,985
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.

1156
01:08:09,985 --> 01:08:19,405
35 seconds.

1157
01:08:19,405 --> 01:08:21,865
30 seconds.

1158
01:08:21,865 --> 01:08:23,915
Turn at Massif in...

1159
01:08:23,915 --> 01:08:25,875
7...

1160
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,375
6...

1161
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:28,875
5...

1162
01:08:28,875 --> 01:08:29,875
4...

1163
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:31,375
3...

1164
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:32,545
2...

1165
01:08:32,545 --> 01:08:33,505
1...

1166
01:08:33,505 --> 01:08:34,505
Mark.

1167
01:08:34,505 --> 01:08:36,215
Torpedo impact 25 seconds.

1168
01:08:36,215 --> 01:08:37,385
The turn, Captain.

1169
01:08:37,385 --> 01:08:41,515
Not yet.

1170
01:08:41,515 --> 01:08:43,685
Mark plus 8 seconds...

1171
01:08:43,685 --> 01:08:44,765
plus 9...

1172
01:08:44,765 --> 01:08:46,065
plus 10 seconds...

1173
01:08:46,065 --> 01:08:48,275
plus 11...plus 12...

1174
01:08:48,275 --> 01:08:49,775
plus 13 seconds...

1175
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:50,775
plus 14...

1176
01:08:50,775 --> 01:08:52,235
plus 15 seconds.

1177
01:08:52,235 --> 01:08:56,235
Captain, we're out of position
by a boat length.

1178
01:08:56,235 --> 01:08:58,825
Torpedo impact now 15 seconds.

1179
01:08:58,825 --> 01:09:01,035
Sound collision.

1180
01:09:01,035 --> 01:09:02,205
Sound collision.

1181
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:03,995
We're out of the lane!

1182
01:09:03,995 --> 01:09:05,535
You're relieved.

1183
01:09:05,535 --> 01:09:12,625
Borodin?

1184
01:09:12,625 --> 01:09:14,005
Right full rudder!

1185
01:09:14,005 --> 01:09:15,045
Reverse starboard engine!

1186
01:09:15,045 --> 01:09:16,045
Right full rudder.

1187
01:09:16,045 --> 01:09:17,295
All back starboard shaft.

1188
01:09:17,295 --> 01:09:22,055
All back starboard shaft!

1189
01:09:22,055 --> 01:09:24,765
Torpedo impact 12 seconds...

1190
01:09:24,765 --> 01:09:27,815
10... 9... 8...

1191
01:09:27,815 --> 01:10:01,845
7... 6... 5...

1192
01:10:01,845 --> 01:10:04,515
Captain, they're
really shooting at us!

1193
01:10:04,515 --> 01:10:05,515
Pull yourself together!

1194
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:08,105
Boy! Easy, boy.

1195
01:10:08,105 --> 01:10:11,275
If they were really
shooting at us,

1196
01:10:11,275 --> 01:10:13,275
we'd be dead by now.

1197
01:10:13,275 --> 01:10:32,125
Give me some line.

1198
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:35,255
I found out what happened
to the caterpillar.

1199
01:10:35,255 --> 01:10:38,715
The buffer circuit
has been torn out.

1200
01:10:38,715 --> 01:10:41,715
It was only a matter of time

1201
01:10:41,715 --> 01:10:44,015
before an overload
shut it down.

1202
01:10:44,015 --> 01:10:45,725
What are you saying?

1203
01:10:45,725 --> 01:10:48,725
Whoever did this knew how
to cripple the caterpillar

1204
01:10:48,725 --> 01:10:50,765
in a way not easy to find.

1205
01:10:50,765 --> 01:10:57,735
Captain,
we have a saboteur on board.

1206
01:10:57,735 --> 01:11:00,735
It can't be any of the officers.

1207
01:11:00,735 --> 01:11:03,785
They had plenty of time
before we embarked.

1208
01:11:03,785 --> 01:11:05,785
Must be a crew member.

1209
01:11:05,785 --> 01:11:07,245
Go to Putin's cabin.

1210
01:11:07,245 --> 01:11:10,245
Check his files
for information on the crew.

1211
01:11:10,245 --> 01:11:16,255
We may have to put them off
before we planned.

1212
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:19,335
The average Russky, son,
don't take a dump

1213
01:11:19,335 --> 01:11:22,805
without a plan.

1214
01:11:22,805 --> 01:11:25,765
Wait a minute.

1215
01:11:25,765 --> 01:11:29,265
We don't have to get
the crew off the sub.

1216
01:11:29,265 --> 01:11:31,805
He would have had to do that.

1217
01:11:31,805 --> 01:11:36,275
We just have to figure out
what he's going to do.

1218
01:11:36,275 --> 01:11:40,275
How is he going
to get them off the sub?

1219
01:11:40,275 --> 01:11:44,275
They'd have to want to get off.

1220
01:11:44,275 --> 01:11:46,825
How do you get a crew

1221
01:11:46,825 --> 01:11:50,365
to want to get off a submarine?

1222
01:11:50,365 --> 01:11:52,415
How do you get them
to want to get off

1223
01:11:52,415 --> 01:11:54,035
a nuclear sub...

1224
01:11:54,035 --> 01:11:56,755
I know how he's going
to evacuate the sub.

1225
01:11:56,755 --> 01:11:58,215
Not now, Jack.

1226
01:11:58,215 --> 01:12:01,215
Yankee One star base,
say again status.

1227
01:12:01,215 --> 01:12:02,715
Declare an emergency.

1228
01:12:02,715 --> 01:12:04,715
Declare an emergency.

1229
01:12:04,715 --> 01:12:06,265
Yankee One,
requesting vectors.

1230
01:12:06,265 --> 01:12:09,225
Vector 2-7-0 speed is buster.

1231
01:12:09,225 --> 01:12:11,725
Yankee One's
losing hydraulic pressure.

1232
01:12:11,725 --> 01:12:13,515
Say again, Yankee One.

1233
01:12:13,515 --> 01:12:16,145
Bear Foxtrot got too close
to the group.

1234
01:12:16,145 --> 01:12:19,775
One of the F-14s crowded him,
and they bumped.

1235
01:12:19,775 --> 01:12:21,275
He's losing hydraulic fluid.

1236
01:12:21,275 --> 01:12:24,615
They're trying to get him
back aboard now.

1237
01:12:24,615 --> 01:12:26,155
Busy morning.

1238
01:12:26,155 --> 01:12:27,865
Hmm.

1239
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:33,165
Russian attack subs are now stationed
off every East Coast port.

1240
01:12:33,165 --> 01:12:35,125
We're up here.

1241
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:38,125
The New Jersey
is moving up the coast

1242
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:41,625
while the Russians,
aside from over 100 bear foxtrots,

1243
01:12:41,625 --> 01:12:45,135
have a row of subs
and several surface groups.

1244
01:12:45,135 --> 01:12:46,595
That's a lot of firepower.

1245
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,555
For a rescue team, yes.

1246
01:12:48,555 --> 01:12:50,055
There's something else strange.

1247
01:12:50,055 --> 01:12:53,145
They're using sonar as if
they're looking for something,

1248
01:12:53,145 --> 01:12:54,645
but nobody's listening.

1249
01:12:54,645 --> 01:12:56,145
What do you mean?

1250
01:12:56,145 --> 01:12:59,855
At their speed they could
run over my daughter's stereo

1251
01:12:59,855 --> 01:13:02,355
and not hear it.

1252
01:13:02,355 --> 01:13:04,355
They're not searching
for Ramius.

1253
01:13:04,355 --> 01:13:05,865
They're driving him.

1254
01:13:05,865 --> 01:13:11,155
Driving him where?

1255
01:13:11,155 --> 01:13:13,615
The hounds to the hunters.

1256
01:13:13,615 --> 01:13:16,665
Your sub captain's going
to make it to America.

1257
01:13:16,665 --> 01:13:20,165
He's going to die
within sight of it.

1258
01:13:20,165 --> 01:13:24,175
His wing man kept requesting
permission to fire.

1259
01:13:24,175 --> 01:13:27,635
Somebody messes up, we'll be
in the biggest naval battle

1260
01:13:27,635 --> 01:13:31,175
since the Jutland.
Jesus!

1261
01:13:31,175 --> 01:13:33,725
Water's too cold to eject him.

1262
01:13:33,725 --> 01:13:36,355
Air boss will try
to bring him aboard.

1263
01:13:36,355 --> 01:13:39,225
Sir, what's this sub
off by herself?

1264
01:13:39,225 --> 01:13:40,525
Bart Mancuso's boat.

1265
01:13:40,525 --> 01:13:44,065
He's going to the bottom
of Red Route One.

1266
01:13:44,065 --> 01:13:45,525
He's had intermittent contact

1267
01:13:45,525 --> 01:13:48,985
with a magma displacement.
He's got this...

1268
01:13:48,985 --> 01:13:50,035
Magma displacement?

1269
01:13:50,035 --> 01:13:52,245
Is that like a seismic anomaly?

1270
01:13:52,245 --> 01:13:54,205
I suppose so. Why?

1271
01:13:54,205 --> 01:13:58,035
Is there a way you could
get me on board the Dallas?

1272
01:13:58,035 --> 01:13:59,455
What for?

1273
01:13:59,455 --> 01:14:02,005
I think Mancuso's found
the Red October.

1274
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:03,965
He hasn't found anything, Jack.

1275
01:14:03,965 --> 01:14:05,465
He's just waiting.

1276
01:14:05,465 --> 01:14:07,425
Sir, this silent propulsion system

1277
01:14:07,425 --> 01:14:10,005
could easily be mistaken
for something...

1278
01:14:10,005 --> 01:14:13,675
The only way to get you
that far north

1279
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:18,145
is to use a chopper turned
into a flying gas can.

1280
01:14:18,145 --> 01:14:20,605
Admiral, Yankee One
is on final.

1281
01:14:20,605 --> 01:14:22,605
Rescue personnel
are in place.

1282
01:14:22,605 --> 01:14:24,605
Pick up your left wing.

1283
01:14:24,605 --> 01:14:26,105
You're drifting left.

1284
01:14:26,105 --> 01:14:27,605
Power, power!

1285
01:14:27,605 --> 01:14:29,405
Wave off, wave off!

1286
01:14:29,405 --> 01:14:41,625
Eject, eject, eject!

1287
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:42,665
Fire, fire!

1288
01:14:42,665 --> 01:14:45,335
Fire on the flight deck!

1289
01:14:45,335 --> 01:14:48,335
This business will
get out of control,

1290
01:14:48,335 --> 01:14:53,175
and we'll be lucky
to live through it.

1291
01:14:53,175 --> 01:14:55,135
Fire on the flight deck.

1292
01:14:55,135 --> 01:15:03,145
All hands lend assistance.

1293
01:15:03,145 --> 01:15:06,145
The bird's loaded down
with enough fuel to get you there,

1294
01:15:06,145 --> 01:15:08,235
but Dallas may not be there.

1295
01:15:08,235 --> 01:15:09,985
We're trying to reach her.

1296
01:15:09,985 --> 01:15:11,735
If she's gone deep,
it's dodgey.

1297
01:15:11,735 --> 01:15:21,165
If you have to ditch...

1298
01:15:21,165 --> 01:15:23,205
If you have to ditch,

1299
01:15:23,205 --> 01:15:25,915
don't think about anything
but the survival gear.

1300
01:15:25,915 --> 01:15:27,335
At this water's temperature,

1301
01:15:27,335 --> 01:15:29,175
you'll have about four minutes.

1302
01:15:29,175 --> 01:15:34,385
I'll try to remember that.

1303
01:15:34,385 --> 01:16:02,665
Next time, Jack,
write a goddamn memo.

1304
01:16:02,665 --> 01:16:05,705
Diving Officer,
make your depth 6-5-0 feet.

1305
01:16:05,705 --> 01:16:08,215
Make my depth 6-5-0 feet.

1306
01:16:08,215 --> 01:16:11,215
Sonar, Conn preceding
below the thermal layer.

1307
01:16:11,215 --> 01:16:12,715
The captain's sacked out?

1308
01:16:12,715 --> 01:16:13,715
Yeah.

1309
01:16:13,715 --> 01:16:16,715
Auxiliaries
proceed 5,000 pounds.

1310
01:16:16,715 --> 01:16:18,225
What about him?

1311
01:16:18,225 --> 01:16:19,765
He won't leave.

1312
01:16:19,765 --> 01:16:21,145
Conn. Sonar, hold.

1313
01:16:21,145 --> 01:16:29,355
No contacts on bearing 2-9-5.

1314
01:16:29,355 --> 01:16:30,855
You know...

1315
01:16:30,855 --> 01:16:33,695
I seen me a mermaid once.

1316
01:16:33,695 --> 01:16:37,655
I've even seen me
a shark eat a octopus,

1317
01:16:37,655 --> 01:17:18,785
but I ain't never seen
no phantom Russian submarine.

1318
01:17:18,785 --> 01:17:21,245
We're emerging
from the route, Captain.

1319
01:17:21,245 --> 01:17:23,785
I've ordered a routine clearing
of the baffles.

1320
01:17:23,785 --> 01:17:28,495
We'll be making the first turn
in a few minutes.

1321
01:17:28,495 --> 01:17:30,125
The caterpillar is operational

1322
01:17:30,125 --> 01:17:34,965
and appears to be
running normally.

1323
01:17:34,965 --> 01:17:38,175
The crew know about the saboteur.

1324
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:41,515
They are afraid.

1325
01:17:41,515 --> 01:17:47,815
Well, that could be useful
when the time comes.

1326
01:17:47,815 --> 01:17:52,315
You know, we could make
the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

1327
01:17:52,315 --> 01:17:56,815
Half of them would freeze
before they were rescued.

1328
01:17:56,815 --> 01:17:59,865
No, it's Massachusetts
or Maine...

1329
01:17:59,865 --> 01:18:01,745
in 48 hours.

1330
01:18:01,745 --> 01:18:10,745
Two days.

1331
01:18:10,745 --> 01:18:22,055
Do you think they will
let me live in Montana?

1332
01:18:22,055 --> 01:18:28,225
I would think they'll
let you live wherever you want.

1333
01:18:28,225 --> 01:18:29,725
Good.

1334
01:18:29,725 --> 01:18:32,775
Then I will live in Montana,

1335
01:18:32,775 --> 01:18:35,775
and I will marry
a round American woman

1336
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,405
and raise rabbits,

1337
01:18:37,405 --> 01:18:40,735
and she will cook them for me,

1338
01:18:40,735 --> 01:18:45,075
and I will have a pickup truck...

1339
01:18:45,075 --> 01:18:47,575
or a...

1340
01:18:47,575 --> 01:18:51,745
possibly even
a recreational vehicle

1341
01:18:51,745 --> 01:18:56,755
and drive from state to state.

1342
01:18:56,755 --> 01:18:59,295
Do they let you do that?

1343
01:18:59,295 --> 01:19:00,295
Yes.

1344
01:19:00,295 --> 01:19:01,635
No papers?

1345
01:19:01,635 --> 01:19:03,265
No papers.

1346
01:19:03,265 --> 01:19:04,975
State to state.

1347
01:19:04,975 --> 01:19:10,895
All right.
Commence your turn.

1348
01:19:10,895 --> 01:19:12,565
Well, then...

1349
01:19:12,565 --> 01:19:17,905
in winter I will live
in Arizona.

1350
01:19:17,905 --> 01:19:21,195
Actually, I think
I will need two wives.

1351
01:19:21,195 --> 01:19:32,455
Oh, at least.

1352
01:19:32,455 --> 01:19:35,625
Possible aspect change
on target.

1353
01:19:35,625 --> 01:19:37,125
Sonar, Conn. Aye.

1354
01:19:37,125 --> 01:19:43,215
Concur possible target zig
based on bearing rate.

1355
01:19:43,215 --> 01:19:44,845
Conn! Sonar! Crazy Ivan!

1356
01:19:44,845 --> 01:19:46,385
All stop! Quick quiet!

1357
01:19:46,385 --> 01:19:47,845
All stop, aye.

1358
01:19:47,845 --> 01:19:55,025
Engine's all stopped.

1359
01:19:55,025 --> 01:19:56,855
What's going on, Jonesy?

1360
01:19:56,855 --> 01:19:59,275
Russian captains
sometimes turn suddenly

1361
01:19:59,275 --> 01:20:02,275
to see if anyone's behind them.

1362
01:20:02,275 --> 01:20:04,275
We call it Crazy Ivan.

1363
01:20:04,275 --> 01:20:07,245
The only thing
you can do is go dead,

1364
01:20:07,245 --> 01:20:10,865
shut everything down, and make
like a hole in the water.

1365
01:20:10,865 --> 01:20:12,575
So what's the catch?

1366
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:14,745
Catch is a boat this big

1367
01:20:14,745 --> 01:20:16,755
doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

1368
01:20:16,755 --> 01:20:18,255
If we're too close,

1369
01:20:18,255 --> 01:20:24,095
we'll drift right
into the back of him.

1370
01:20:24,095 --> 01:20:38,145
What about you?
What do you look forward to?

1371
01:20:38,145 --> 01:20:39,775
I...

1372
01:20:39,775 --> 01:20:43,615
I have no such appetites.

1373
01:20:43,615 --> 01:20:51,785
Now, let's see if he can hear us.

1374
01:20:51,785 --> 01:21:02,125
Well, there must be something.

1375
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:04,675
What is it?

1376
01:21:04,675 --> 01:21:07,805
Ahh.

1377
01:21:07,805 --> 01:21:11,805
I miss...
the peace of fishing

1378
01:21:11,805 --> 01:21:17,815
Like when I was a boy.

1379
01:21:17,815 --> 01:21:22,105
40 years I have been at sea.

1380
01:21:22,105 --> 01:21:26,275
A war at sea.

1381
01:21:26,275 --> 01:21:30,785
A war with no battles.

1382
01:21:30,785 --> 01:21:34,455
No monuments.

1383
01:21:34,455 --> 01:21:40,125
Only casualties.

1384
01:21:40,125 --> 01:21:46,635
I widowed her
the day I married her.

1385
01:21:46,635 --> 01:22:09,655
My wife died while I
was at sea, you know.

1386
01:22:09,655 --> 01:22:12,155
Post guards
in the engineering spaces.

1387
01:22:12,155 --> 01:22:14,665
If he can get
to the caterpillar,

1388
01:22:14,665 --> 01:22:20,165
he can get to somewhere
more vital.

1389
01:22:20,165 --> 01:22:22,295
Where is he, Jonesy?

1390
01:22:22,295 --> 01:22:23,505
Conn, Sonar.

1391
01:22:23,505 --> 01:22:26,715
Target is now coming out
of our starboard baffles.

1392
01:22:26,715 --> 01:22:30,135
My read is that he
is returning to base course.

1393
01:22:30,135 --> 01:22:33,595
Concur. He's returning
to course 2-1-0.

1394
01:22:33,595 --> 01:22:36,265
He went right around us.

1395
01:22:36,265 --> 01:22:38,765
We'll give him
another 30 seconds,

1396
01:22:38,765 --> 01:22:42,475
then secure from silent running.

1397
01:22:42,475 --> 01:22:44,605
Captain?

1398
01:22:44,605 --> 01:22:48,615
Here's what we got
on the E.L.F.

1399
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:49,615
Thanks.

1400
01:22:49,615 --> 01:22:58,285
Aye, sir.

1401
01:22:58,285 --> 01:23:02,335
What is it?

1402
01:23:02,335 --> 01:23:17,845
You're not going
to believe this.

1403
01:23:17,845 --> 01:23:19,895
Commander,
we are approaching no return.

1404
01:23:19,895 --> 01:23:21,725
Dallas apparently
hasn't gotten the message.

1405
01:23:21,725 --> 01:23:24,225
We have to turn back
for the carrier.

1406
01:23:24,225 --> 01:23:26,065
Give it a couple more minutes.

1407
01:23:26,065 --> 01:23:28,405
Negative. Fuel status
says we turn around now.

1408
01:23:28,405 --> 01:23:30,905
Fuel status?
You got a reserve, don't you?

1409
01:23:30,905 --> 01:23:32,735
I've got a 10-minute reserve,

1410
01:23:32,735 --> 01:23:35,655
but I'm not allowed to invade that
except during war.

1411
01:23:35,655 --> 01:23:37,955
If you don't get me
on that submarine,

1412
01:23:37,955 --> 01:23:39,245
you might have it.

1413
01:23:39,245 --> 01:23:41,495
You got 10 minutes
worth of fuel.

1414
01:23:41,495 --> 01:23:48,425
We stay here 10 more minutes.

1415
01:23:48,425 --> 01:23:50,085
Yo! Mount up!

1416
01:23:50,085 --> 01:23:52,255
Yo, I got a submarine
at around 3:00.

1417
01:23:52,255 --> 01:23:55,765
About 2 miles.

1418
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:57,635
OK, Tony, hook him up.

1419
01:23:57,635 --> 01:24:00,895
I'll be lowering you down
to the submarine now.

1420
01:24:00,895 --> 01:24:02,355
Give me eight minutes.

1421
01:24:02,355 --> 01:24:05,855
Let's hope this thing
runs on fumes.

1422
01:24:05,855 --> 01:24:07,945
Very well.
Surface the ship.

1423
01:24:07,945 --> 01:24:09,445
Whoever this guy is,

1424
01:24:09,445 --> 01:24:11,815
he's in for one hell of a ride.

1425
01:24:11,815 --> 01:24:15,615
OK, Commander,
go ahead and sit down.

1426
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:17,615
You ever do this before?

1427
01:24:17,615 --> 01:24:19,955
Once. On a calm day...
off Hawaii.

1428
01:24:19,955 --> 01:24:22,785
The pilot will have
a difficult time keeping steady.

1429
01:24:22,785 --> 01:24:24,285
Don't take chances
getting grounded.

1430
01:24:24,285 --> 01:24:26,295
Keep that rod in front of you.

1431
01:24:26,295 --> 01:24:27,625
In air like this,

1432
01:24:27,625 --> 01:24:29,795
the rotors will put out
enough static electricity

1433
01:24:29,795 --> 01:24:31,135
to light up Chicago.

1434
01:24:31,135 --> 01:24:32,635
That's why I joined the Navy.

1435
01:24:32,635 --> 01:24:34,465
A diver's in the escape trunk

1436
01:24:34,465 --> 01:24:36,805
in case this guy
goes in the drink.

1437
01:24:36,805 --> 01:24:39,175
Someone must have
a burr up his ass

1438
01:24:39,175 --> 01:24:59,495
to go for a stunt like this.

1439
01:24:59,495 --> 01:25:01,665
All right. Ready! Ready!

1440
01:25:01,665 --> 01:25:04,205
Get your hook up!

1441
01:25:04,205 --> 01:25:07,335
Commander, if I got
to bring you back up,

1442
01:25:07,335 --> 01:25:09,415
I'm going to shake the wire.

1443
01:25:09,415 --> 01:25:12,545
I'll give you a thumbs up,
like this.

1444
01:25:12,545 --> 01:25:14,635
Remember to cross your arms.

1445
01:25:14,635 --> 01:25:24,685
Got it? OK. Out you go.
Passenger's out the door.

1446
01:25:24,685 --> 01:25:27,515
Passenger's halfway down,
drifting forward.

1447
01:25:27,515 --> 01:25:32,775
Start forward.

1448
01:25:32,775 --> 01:25:36,195
All right, Tommy.
Get the hook on his cable.

1449
01:25:36,195 --> 01:25:38,195
On his cable. Now, watch it.

1450
01:25:38,195 --> 01:25:45,535
Don't touch him.
OK, here he comes.

1451
01:25:45,535 --> 01:25:47,245
Oh, no!

1452
01:25:47,245 --> 01:25:49,955
It would be easier
without that bloody crosswind.

1453
01:25:49,955 --> 01:25:54,045
Where is he?
I can't see him.

1454
01:25:54,045 --> 01:25:56,715
Don't touch him!

1455
01:25:56,715 --> 01:26:00,715
Jack! Jack! Jack!

1456
01:26:00,715 --> 01:26:02,805
This is never going to work.

1457
01:26:02,805 --> 01:26:12,605
OK, reel him back in.

1458
01:26:12,605 --> 01:26:19,075
Tony, what's going on back...

1459
01:26:19,075 --> 01:26:22,075
What happened? Dallas,
have you got a swimmer standing?

1460
01:26:22,075 --> 01:26:23,575
Emergency stop! Man overboard!

1461
01:26:23,575 --> 01:26:26,785
Port side!
Send out the diver!

1462
01:26:26,785 --> 01:26:38,255
Very well, Dallas.
We are history.

1463
01:26:38,255 --> 01:26:40,095
Get the doc down here!

1464
01:26:40,095 --> 01:26:45,435
I'll be in the escape trunk.

1465
01:26:45,435 --> 01:26:51,935
Down ladder! Down ladder!
Make a hole!

1466
01:26:51,935 --> 01:27:05,115
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

1467
01:27:05,115 --> 01:27:07,115
How do you do, Captain?

1468
01:27:07,115 --> 01:27:12,295
It's a pleasure to be aboard.

1469
01:27:12,295 --> 01:27:15,965
I have to talk to the President.

1470
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:21,055
Of course.
May I inquire as to the subject?

1471
01:27:21,055 --> 01:27:23,635
It seems that the initial reports

1472
01:27:23,635 --> 01:27:26,635
that one of our submarines
was missing

1473
01:27:26,635 --> 01:27:30,055
were not completely accurate.

1474
01:27:30,055 --> 01:27:32,065
The submarine in question

1475
01:27:32,065 --> 01:27:35,525
is commanded
by Captain Marko Ramius.

1476
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:37,775
Apparently, he has suffered

1477
01:27:37,775 --> 01:27:42,575
a kind of mental
nervous breakdown.

1478
01:27:42,575 --> 01:27:44,785
Just before he sailed,

1479
01:27:44,785 --> 01:27:48,245
he posted a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin

1480
01:27:48,245 --> 01:27:53,745
in which he announced
his intention to...

1481
01:27:53,745 --> 01:27:57,165
to fire his missiles
on the United States.

1482
01:27:57,165 --> 01:28:01,005
Why didn't you tell me this
the last time we met?

1483
01:28:01,005 --> 01:28:03,175
In my position
I'm sometimes compromised

1484
01:28:03,175 --> 01:28:06,425
by the fact Moscow doesn't
always tell me everything.

1485
01:28:06,425 --> 01:28:09,845
So one of your submarine captains
has gone insane?

1486
01:28:09,845 --> 01:28:12,185
What do you want from us?

1487
01:28:12,185 --> 01:28:13,685
You offered your assistance.

1488
01:28:13,685 --> 01:28:15,185
That was a rescue mission.

1489
01:28:15,185 --> 01:28:17,185
Now you want us to help you

1490
01:28:17,185 --> 01:28:19,235
hunt him down and kill him.

1491
01:28:19,235 --> 01:28:20,695
I have been instructed

1492
01:28:20,695 --> 01:28:24,905
to ask your President
for precisely that.

1493
01:28:24,905 --> 01:28:27,365
Find him?
We already found him.

1494
01:28:27,365 --> 01:28:29,705
We had to break off
to pick you up.

1495
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:31,245
Captain, excuse me.
Coffee?

1496
01:28:31,245 --> 01:28:32,245
Thank you.

1497
01:28:32,245 --> 01:28:33,245
Cigarette?

1498
01:28:33,245 --> 01:28:34,205
Don't smoke.

1499
01:28:34,205 --> 01:28:36,205
Assuming we can find him,

1500
01:28:36,205 --> 01:28:39,715
just what exactly
am I supposed to do about it?

1501
01:28:39,715 --> 01:28:40,835
Captain, radio.

1502
01:28:40,835 --> 01:28:42,215
We're receiving
flash traffic

1503
01:28:42,215 --> 01:28:44,255
on the V.L.F.
emergency circuit.

1504
01:28:44,255 --> 01:28:47,725
Very well. Bring it down.

1505
01:28:47,725 --> 01:28:52,225
Well, Mr. Ryan?

1506
01:28:52,225 --> 01:28:54,725
Chief, excuse us for a second.

1507
01:28:54,725 --> 01:29:02,775
Leonard,
come on out of there.

1508
01:29:02,775 --> 01:29:06,325
The sub we're after
is called the Red October.

1509
01:29:06,325 --> 01:29:09,075
She's under the command
of a man named Ramius.

1510
01:29:09,075 --> 01:29:10,405
Now, there's the possibility

1511
01:29:10,405 --> 01:29:13,285
that he and a good
portion of his crew

1512
01:29:13,285 --> 01:29:17,245
are attempting to defect.

1513
01:29:17,245 --> 01:29:20,295
Defect?

1514
01:29:20,295 --> 01:29:37,775
Excuse me.

1515
01:29:37,775 --> 01:29:40,775
You say the boat's
called the Red October?

1516
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:41,775
That's right.

1517
01:29:41,775 --> 01:29:42,815
Skipper's Ramius?

1518
01:29:42,815 --> 01:29:45,115
Right.

1519
01:29:45,115 --> 01:29:46,615
It seems the circumstances

1520
01:29:46,615 --> 01:29:55,285
have changed somewhat,
Mr. Ryan.

1521
01:29:55,285 --> 01:29:57,665
Get this man some dry clothes.

1522
01:29:57,665 --> 01:29:59,505
I'll be in the conn.

1523
01:29:59,505 --> 01:30:01,125
Aye, aye, sir.

1524
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:02,795
"National Command Authority

1525
01:30:02,795 --> 01:30:05,505
informed Soviet typhoon class
submarine Red October

1526
01:30:05,505 --> 01:30:07,045
is potential renegade

1527
01:30:07,045 --> 01:30:08,965
and threatens
independent missile launch.

1528
01:30:08,965 --> 01:30:11,975
You are authorized
to use any necessary force

1529
01:30:11,975 --> 01:30:13,475
to prevent said submarine

1530
01:30:13,475 --> 01:30:14,475
from approaching

1531
01:30:14,475 --> 01:30:30,825
the coast
of the United States".

1532
01:30:30,825 --> 01:30:34,325
Left 10 degrees rudder
steady on course 2-6-5.

1533
01:30:34,325 --> 01:30:38,455
Left 10 degrees rudder
secure course of 2-6-5.

1534
01:30:38,455 --> 01:30:40,335
Make turns for 14 knots.

1535
01:30:40,335 --> 01:30:45,675
Chief of the watch,
rig for red.

1536
01:30:45,675 --> 01:30:47,005
Time Quartermasters
and Navigator

1537
01:30:47,005 --> 01:30:52,765
on the deck in the conn.

1538
01:30:52,765 --> 01:30:54,175
What's going on?

1539
01:30:54,175 --> 01:30:56,685
Battle stations
are manned and ready.

1540
01:30:56,685 --> 01:30:57,685
Very well.

1541
01:30:57,685 --> 01:31:00,185
Captain, I have to talk to you.

1542
01:31:00,185 --> 01:31:01,015
Not now.

1543
01:31:01,015 --> 01:31:03,025
Make your depth 1,200 feet,

1544
01:31:03,025 --> 01:31:04,895
20 degrees down angle.

1545
01:31:04,895 --> 01:31:08,695
Diving officer, make your depth
1,200 feet, 20 degree down.

1546
01:31:08,695 --> 01:31:11,195
Full dive
on fair water planes.

1547
01:31:11,195 --> 01:31:13,195
Full dive on stern planes.

1548
01:31:13,195 --> 01:31:18,535
20 degree down.

1549
01:31:18,535 --> 01:31:23,705
Passing 450 feet,
going to 1,200.

1550
01:31:23,705 --> 01:31:27,085
500.

1551
01:31:27,085 --> 01:31:30,595
600.

1552
01:31:30,595 --> 01:31:36,635
700.

1553
01:31:36,635 --> 01:31:39,015
Did you get a good fix?

1554
01:31:39,015 --> 01:31:40,055
Yes, Captain.

1555
01:31:40,055 --> 01:31:41,145
Very well.

1556
01:31:41,145 --> 01:31:47,565
At ordered depth,
1,200 feet.

1557
01:31:47,565 --> 01:31:50,445
Sonar, Conn.
You got him, yet, Jonesy?

1558
01:31:50,445 --> 01:31:52,735
Very faint, sir. Hold on.

1559
01:31:52,735 --> 01:31:56,575
Yes, sir. Contact typhoon seven
on bearing 2-5-0.

1560
01:31:56,575 --> 01:31:58,575
Right where he's supposed to be.

1561
01:31:58,575 --> 01:32:01,085
Any sign he's alerted
to our presence?

1562
01:32:01,085 --> 01:32:02,625
No. Operating as before.

1563
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:04,585
Come left 2-6-5.

1564
01:32:04,585 --> 01:32:07,585
Bring us up
behind him quietly, Tommy.

1565
01:32:07,585 --> 01:32:08,715
Aye, aye, Captain.

1566
01:32:08,715 --> 01:32:20,595
Diving officer,
make your depth 500 feet.

1567
01:32:20,595 --> 01:32:22,435
Captain, please listen to me.

1568
01:32:22,435 --> 01:32:25,315
Two minutes, that's all.

1569
01:32:25,315 --> 01:32:27,985
Plot, time to intercept his track.

1570
01:32:27,985 --> 01:32:29,855
Four minutes, Captain.

1571
01:32:29,855 --> 01:32:32,025
Very well, Mr. Ryan.

1572
01:32:32,025 --> 01:32:39,955
Two minutes.

1573
01:32:39,955 --> 01:32:44,285
It makes perfect sense.
Look at the situation...

1574
01:32:44,285 --> 01:32:46,955
Ramius intends to defect.
The Russians know this,

1575
01:32:46,955 --> 01:32:48,505
which is why they've
tried to sink him,

1576
01:32:48,505 --> 01:32:51,045
but they haven't been able to.

1577
01:32:51,045 --> 01:32:53,005
I have a firing solution.

1578
01:32:53,005 --> 01:32:55,465
The Russians
will stop at nothing

1579
01:32:55,465 --> 01:32:57,465
to prevent Ramius
from defecting.

1580
01:32:57,465 --> 01:32:59,635
They've invented
this story that he's crazy

1581
01:32:59,635 --> 01:33:02,145
because they need us
to sink him

1582
01:33:02,145 --> 01:33:06,145
before he can contact us.

1583
01:33:06,145 --> 01:33:08,315
Weapons control,
I want full safeties.

1584
01:33:08,315 --> 01:33:11,025
I don't want this fish
coming back.

1585
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:12,195
Full safety.

1586
01:33:12,195 --> 01:33:15,405
Captain, I know this man.

1587
01:33:15,405 --> 01:33:18,075
Has he made any Crazy Ivans?

1588
01:33:18,075 --> 01:33:19,575
What difference does that make?

1589
01:33:19,575 --> 01:33:22,245
- The next one will be to starboard.
- 'Cause his last was to port?

1590
01:33:22,245 --> 01:33:30,045
Because he goes to starboard
in the bottom half of the hour.

1591
01:33:30,045 --> 01:33:32,505
Flood tubes one and two.
Warm up the weapons.

1592
01:33:32,505 --> 01:33:36,305
Find a way to establish contact
without violating orders.

1593
01:33:36,305 --> 01:33:37,805
He wants to defect!

1594
01:33:37,805 --> 01:33:39,845
Mr. Thompson,
call Chief Watson

1595
01:33:39,845 --> 01:33:46,015
to the conn with his sidearm.

1596
01:33:46,015 --> 01:33:48,725
Conn, Sonar.
Signal to noise ratio's dropping.

1597
01:33:48,725 --> 01:33:50,895
Possible aspect change
in target.

1598
01:33:50,895 --> 01:33:55,695
Possible target zig
based on bearing rate.

1599
01:33:55,695 --> 01:34:01,245
Conn, Sonar. Crazy Ivan!

1600
01:34:01,245 --> 01:34:03,575
Captain.

1601
01:34:03,575 --> 01:34:08,545
Captain, he's turning.

1602
01:34:08,545 --> 01:34:10,665
Which way is he turning?

1603
01:34:10,665 --> 01:34:13,375
To the starboard, sir.

1604
01:34:13,375 --> 01:34:17,255
Give the man a chance.

1605
01:34:17,255 --> 01:34:19,215
All back full.

1606
01:34:19,215 --> 01:34:20,715
Captain, say again.

1607
01:34:20,715 --> 01:34:22,765
I said all back full!

1608
01:34:22,765 --> 01:34:24,265
Back full. Aye, sir.

1609
01:34:24,265 --> 01:34:30,225
Engines back full.

1610
01:34:30,225 --> 01:34:32,395
We're cavitating.
He can hear us!

1611
01:34:32,395 --> 01:34:34,815
Conn, aye. All stop.

1612
01:34:34,815 --> 01:34:36,195
All stop, aye.

1613
01:34:36,195 --> 01:34:39,235
All right.
We just unzipped our fly.

1614
01:34:39,235 --> 01:34:41,745
Mr. Thompson,
open the outer doors.

1615
01:34:41,745 --> 01:34:43,245
Firing point procedures.

1616
01:34:43,245 --> 01:34:46,245
Now, if that bastard
so much as twitches,

1617
01:34:46,245 --> 01:34:49,085
I'm going to blow him
right to Mars.

1618
01:34:49,085 --> 01:34:51,205
All stop rudder amid ship.

1619
01:34:51,205 --> 01:34:52,715
What's going on?

1620
01:34:52,715 --> 01:34:54,375
Can you identify the contact?

1621
01:34:54,375 --> 01:34:56,885
American Los Angeles-class
attack submarine

1622
01:34:56,885 --> 01:34:58,385
bearing 0-1-5...

1623
01:34:58,385 --> 01:34:59,885
Captain,
sharp metallic transients.

1624
01:34:59,885 --> 01:35:03,975
He may be trying to open
his torpedo tube doors.

1625
01:35:03,975 --> 01:35:07,555
Outer doors are open
on tubes one and two.

1626
01:35:07,555 --> 01:35:09,055
We're ready to shoot.

1627
01:35:09,055 --> 01:35:11,975
Very well.
My orders are specific, Mr. Ryan.

1628
01:35:11,975 --> 01:35:14,065
He's opened his outer doors.

1629
01:35:14,065 --> 01:35:15,195
He's preparing to fire.

1630
01:35:15,195 --> 01:35:18,775
Flood tubes three and four
and plot a solution.

1631
01:35:18,775 --> 01:35:22,445
Captain, flood tubes three and four.
Plot solution.

1632
01:35:22,445 --> 01:35:26,785
Shall I open
the torpedo tube door, sir?

1633
01:35:26,785 --> 01:35:30,285
Captain,
shall I open outer doors?

1634
01:35:30,285 --> 01:35:33,335
No.

1635
01:35:33,335 --> 01:35:36,005
Lock the firing solution
into the computer.

1636
01:35:36,005 --> 01:35:46,635
Do not open the doors.

1637
01:35:46,635 --> 01:35:49,685
Aye, Captain.

1638
01:35:49,685 --> 01:35:52,935
Lock solution into computer.

1639
01:35:52,935 --> 01:35:55,315
Conn, Sonar.
Target's flooded his tubes.

1640
01:35:55,315 --> 01:35:57,815
Has he opened his outer doors?

1641
01:35:57,815 --> 01:36:00,315
Negative, Captain.
He's just sitting there.

1642
01:36:00,315 --> 01:36:01,525
Hold on.

1643
01:36:01,525 --> 01:36:04,695
Hull popping.
Target's coming shallow.

1644
01:36:04,695 --> 01:36:07,705
What's that mean?

1645
01:36:07,705 --> 01:36:10,075
That means he's
a very cool customer,

1646
01:36:10,075 --> 01:36:11,205
your Russian.

1647
01:36:11,205 --> 01:36:14,245
He knows we're here
and ready to shoot.

1648
01:36:14,245 --> 01:36:15,755
He's not provoking us.

1649
01:36:15,755 --> 01:36:17,715
He's heading to periscope depth

1650
01:36:17,715 --> 01:36:20,215
to see what's on the surface.

1651
01:36:20,215 --> 01:36:23,215
His course is 2-0-7, due west.

1652
01:36:23,215 --> 01:36:24,765
Bring us alongside him.

1653
01:36:24,765 --> 01:36:26,265
Aye, aye, Captain.

1654
01:36:26,265 --> 01:36:28,595
Sonar, Conn.
Report all contacts.

1655
01:36:28,595 --> 01:36:30,185
Conn, Sonar.

1656
01:36:30,185 --> 01:36:34,775
My only contact is typhoon seven,
bearing 1-9-5.

1657
01:36:34,775 --> 01:36:37,735
Very well. Fire control,
range to target?

1658
01:36:37,735 --> 01:36:40,775
Range is 300 yards.

1659
01:36:40,775 --> 01:36:42,735
Make your depth 65 feet.

1660
01:36:42,735 --> 01:36:45,735
Diving Officer,
make your depth 65 feet.

1661
01:36:45,735 --> 01:36:49,245
He wants to go up
and take a peek.

1662
01:36:49,245 --> 01:37:06,465
We'll play along.

1663
01:37:06,465 --> 01:37:08,015
Going to 45.

1664
01:37:08,015 --> 01:37:09,975
Going to 45.

1665
01:37:09,975 --> 01:37:11,395
Weapons status?

1666
01:37:11,395 --> 01:37:13,145
Weapons are on.

1667
01:37:13,145 --> 01:37:14,975
Tubes three and four
are flooded.

1668
01:37:14,975 --> 01:37:16,275
Outer doors are closed.

1669
01:37:16,275 --> 01:37:18,185
25 meters.

1670
01:37:18,185 --> 01:37:19,695
Depth 25 meters.

1671
01:37:19,695 --> 01:37:28,495
Mark this bearing.

1672
01:37:28,495 --> 01:37:32,245
You wanted to talk
to him, Mr. Ryan.

1673
01:37:32,245 --> 01:37:34,875
There he is.

1674
01:37:34,875 --> 01:37:36,915
What do you want to say?

1675
01:37:36,915 --> 01:37:39,375
Is he the only one looking?

1676
01:37:39,375 --> 01:37:40,375
Probably.

1677
01:37:40,375 --> 01:37:44,215
We'll have to chance that.

1678
01:37:44,215 --> 01:37:47,765
"U.S. told you intend
missile launch". Break.

1679
01:37:47,765 --> 01:37:49,215
"Do not approach U.S. coast

1680
01:37:49,215 --> 01:37:53,225
or you will be attacked".
Break.

1681
01:37:53,225 --> 01:37:56,765
"If intention is other...

1682
01:37:56,765 --> 01:37:58,275
will you discuss option?"

1683
01:37:58,275 --> 01:37:59,275
Break.

1684
01:37:59,275 --> 01:38:02,235
Can he acknowledge
with a single ping?

1685
01:38:02,235 --> 01:38:04,735
Yeah, he can.

1686
01:38:04,735 --> 01:38:14,455
The question is, will he?

1687
01:38:14,455 --> 01:38:17,535
Verify our range to target.

1688
01:38:17,535 --> 01:38:21,415
One ping only.

1689
01:38:21,415 --> 01:38:29,595
Aye, captain.

1690
01:38:29,595 --> 01:38:31,095
I'll be damned.

1691
01:38:31,095 --> 01:38:34,805
Now what?

1692
01:38:34,805 --> 01:38:36,435
All right.

1693
01:38:36,435 --> 01:38:42,435
"If defection..."

1694
01:38:42,435 --> 01:38:46,315
You plot course toward..."

1695
01:38:46,315 --> 01:38:48,445
The chart.

1696
01:38:48,445 --> 01:38:49,945
I need a chart.

1697
01:38:49,945 --> 01:38:52,325
No. No.

1698
01:38:52,325 --> 01:38:54,495
OK. Where the hell are we?

1699
01:38:54,495 --> 01:38:58,285
Someplace deep.
Someplace deep.

1700
01:38:58,285 --> 01:39:00,335
OK.

1701
01:39:00,335 --> 01:39:01,455
OK!

1702
01:39:01,455 --> 01:39:06,635
Send them this!

1703
01:39:06,635 --> 01:39:09,005
You out of your mind?

1704
01:39:09,005 --> 01:39:14,345
Just send it.

1705
01:39:14,345 --> 01:39:15,805
Tell me one thing.

1706
01:39:15,805 --> 01:39:19,815
How did you know he was
going to go to starboard?

1707
01:39:19,815 --> 01:39:21,855
I didn't.

1708
01:39:21,855 --> 01:39:25,895
I had a 50/50 chance.
I needed a break. Sorry.

1709
01:39:25,895 --> 01:39:28,025
That's all right, Mr. Ryan.

1710
01:39:28,025 --> 01:39:29,865
My Morse is so rusty

1711
01:39:29,865 --> 01:39:31,825
I may be sending dimensions

1712
01:39:31,825 --> 01:39:53,885
on Playmate of the Month.

1713
01:39:53,885 --> 01:39:58,225
Reverify our range to target.

1714
01:39:58,225 --> 01:39:59,895
One ping only.

1715
01:39:59,895 --> 01:40:01,315
Captain, I... I... I just...

1716
01:40:01,315 --> 01:40:03,815
Give me a ping, Vasily.

1717
01:40:03,815 --> 01:40:09,735
One ping only, please.

1718
01:40:09,735 --> 01:40:14,745
Aye, Captain.

1719
01:40:14,745 --> 01:40:17,325
What the hell is this about?

1720
01:40:17,325 --> 01:40:22,245
The Russians
want us to sink her.

1721
01:40:22,245 --> 01:40:32,095
We might have to do that.

1722
01:40:32,095 --> 01:40:37,765
We must give this American
a wide berth.

1723
01:40:37,765 --> 01:40:49,775
Let us turn south.

1724
01:40:49,775 --> 01:40:53,275
Mr. Kamarov.

1725
01:40:53,275 --> 01:40:56,285
Plot a new course due south.

1726
01:40:56,285 --> 01:40:58,285
Yes, sir.

1727
01:40:58,285 --> 01:41:33,315
New course 1-8-0.

1728
01:41:33,315 --> 01:41:34,825
It's the reactor!

1729
01:41:34,825 --> 01:41:39,325
Shut down the reactor!

1730
01:41:39,325 --> 01:41:40,825
Seal the ventilation system!

1731
01:41:40,825 --> 01:41:42,825
The ventilation controls
have failed!

1732
01:41:42,825 --> 01:41:43,825
Everybody out.

1733
01:41:43,825 --> 01:41:47,205
Clear the compartment!

1734
01:41:47,205 --> 01:41:58,345
Out!

1735
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:00,095
Ventilation system,
shut it down now.

1736
01:42:00,095 --> 01:42:01,725
They don't respond.

1737
01:42:01,725 --> 01:42:03,185
The controls don't respond!

1738
01:42:03,185 --> 01:42:05,225
Bypass it.
Seal it manually!

1739
01:42:05,225 --> 01:42:08,225
Move! Shut it off.

1740
01:42:08,225 --> 01:42:17,025
Melekhin, say again.

1741
01:42:17,025 --> 01:42:20,035
Suffered a leak
in the primary coolant tube,

1742
01:42:20,035 --> 01:42:21,535
so shut down the reactor,

1743
01:42:21,535 --> 01:42:24,205
but the ventilation circuits
have been disabled.

1744
01:42:24,205 --> 01:42:26,125
The coolant appears
highly contaminated.

1745
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:28,165
I knew there was damage

1746
01:42:28,165 --> 01:42:30,125
when the caterpillar went down.

1747
01:42:30,125 --> 01:42:32,625
Radiation alarms activating
in all compartments.

1748
01:42:32,625 --> 01:42:34,125
Engineering
is heavily contaminated,

1749
01:42:34,125 --> 01:42:35,545
and radiation's moving forward.

1750
01:42:35,545 --> 01:42:37,045
Get to periscope depth.

1751
01:42:37,045 --> 01:42:38,385
Ventilate with outside air.

1752
01:42:38,385 --> 01:42:39,885
Aye, Captain.
Periscope depth!

1753
01:42:39,885 --> 01:42:41,385
Prepare to ventilate!

1754
01:42:41,385 --> 01:42:42,845
Ventilating won't do anything.

1755
01:42:42,845 --> 01:42:44,805
We've got to get them off.

1756
01:42:44,805 --> 01:42:46,265
What's the battery condition?

1757
01:42:46,265 --> 01:42:48,815
Four hours.
Six, if we're cautious.

1758
01:42:48,815 --> 01:42:50,275
Engage battery system.

1759
01:42:50,275 --> 01:42:53,065
We've got a level one
radiation leak.

1760
01:42:53,065 --> 01:42:55,565
Every surface of this
ship's contaminated.

1761
01:42:55,565 --> 01:42:58,575
We've got to get the men off.

1762
01:42:58,575 --> 01:43:00,575
Sir, we have been sabotaged!

1763
01:43:00,575 --> 01:43:03,075
Who said anything
about sabotage?

1764
01:43:03,075 --> 01:43:04,575
Captain!

1765
01:43:04,575 --> 01:43:13,255
Sir, I'm afraid
the doctor is right.

1766
01:43:13,255 --> 01:43:14,755
Very well.

1767
01:43:14,755 --> 01:43:17,755
Surface. We'll evacuate
the men to the deck.

1768
01:43:17,755 --> 01:43:18,755
Aye, Captain.

1769
01:43:18,755 --> 01:43:20,255
Surface the ship!

1770
01:43:20,255 --> 01:43:23,265
Prepare to muster all personnel
to escape hatches.

1771
01:43:23,265 --> 01:43:24,765
Break out the rafts.

1772
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:26,765
Lash them to the deck.

1773
01:43:26,765 --> 01:44:12,855
We'll use them as shelters
until the fleet arrives.

1774
01:44:12,855 --> 01:44:15,355
Make sure the count
is accurate, Doctor.

1775
01:44:15,355 --> 01:44:18,315
We must get the entire crew out.

1776
01:44:18,315 --> 01:44:19,775
Yes, sir.

1777
01:44:19,775 --> 01:44:23,155
Master-At-Arms reports rafts secure
and evacuation proceeding.

1778
01:44:23,155 --> 01:44:31,085
Very good.

1779
01:44:31,085 --> 01:44:33,085
We'll rotate through the conn.

1780
01:44:33,085 --> 01:44:37,085
No officer will spend
more than 20 minutes below deck.

1781
01:44:37,085 --> 01:44:38,585
Will that be satisfactory?

1782
01:44:38,585 --> 01:44:39,715
Completely, Captain.

1783
01:44:39,715 --> 01:44:41,005
Surface contact!

1784
01:44:41,005 --> 01:44:42,595
2-7-0.

1785
01:44:42,595 --> 01:44:45,465
6 miles and closing fast.

1786
01:44:45,465 --> 01:44:46,725
It's a warship.

1787
01:44:46,725 --> 01:44:47,765
What? Here?

1788
01:44:47,765 --> 01:44:49,225
Can you identify it?

1789
01:44:49,225 --> 01:44:50,725
It's a frigate,

1790
01:44:50,725 --> 01:44:52,435
U.S., probably,

1791
01:44:52,435 --> 01:44:55,225
Perry class.
He's signaling.

1792
01:44:55,225 --> 01:44:58,945
"Red October.
Red October.

1793
01:44:58,945 --> 01:45:00,815
Halt and stay where you are.

1794
01:45:00,815 --> 01:45:02,695
Do not attempt to submerge,

1795
01:45:02,695 --> 01:45:07,075
or you will be fired upon".

1796
01:45:07,075 --> 01:45:16,205
Captain, I think
he means to board us.

1797
01:45:16,205 --> 01:45:18,715
You will go with the crew.

1798
01:45:18,715 --> 01:45:21,715
The officers and I will submerge beneath you

1799
01:45:21,715 --> 01:45:24,755
and scuttle the ship.

1800
01:45:24,755 --> 01:45:37,475
You'll receive the order of Lenin
for this, Captain.

1801
01:45:37,475 --> 01:45:39,485
We're going to cast off.

1802
01:45:39,485 --> 01:45:47,995
The captain's going
to scuttle the ship.

1803
01:45:47,995 --> 01:45:49,405
He's going down, sir.

1804
01:45:49,405 --> 01:45:51,245
Put a shot across his bow.

1805
01:45:51,245 --> 01:46:23,235
Come right at 1-8-0.

1806
01:46:23,235 --> 01:46:44,175
Seahawk One,
this is Bravo Command.

1807
01:46:44,175 --> 01:46:47,595
She's ready.

1808
01:46:47,595 --> 01:46:50,055
Seahawk One,
release on my command.

1809
01:46:50,055 --> 01:47:01,315
Drop now...now...now.

1810
01:47:01,315 --> 01:47:05,195
Range to target...
900 yards.

1811
01:47:05,195 --> 01:47:09,115
800 yards.

1812
01:47:09,115 --> 01:47:12,155
700 yards.

1813
01:47:12,155 --> 01:47:18,955
600 yards.

1814
01:47:18,955 --> 01:47:22,965
500 yards.

1815
01:47:22,965 --> 01:47:26,675
400 yards.

1816
01:47:26,675 --> 01:47:31,175
300 yards.

1817
01:47:31,175 --> 01:47:34,305
The torpedo is detonated.

1818
01:47:34,305 --> 01:47:36,725
Now, understand, Commander,

1819
01:47:36,725 --> 01:47:39,185
that torpedo
did not self-destruct.

1820
01:47:39,185 --> 01:47:41,685
You heard it hit the hull.

1821
01:47:41,685 --> 01:47:44,985
And I...was never here.

1822
01:47:44,985 --> 01:47:47,525
Contact Dallas.
Give them the go.

1823
01:47:47,525 --> 01:47:50,155
Advise Dallas.
Get the DSRV moving.

1824
01:47:50,155 --> 01:47:58,535
Dallas, this is Rueben James.

1825
01:47:58,535 --> 01:48:00,375
There are about
two million things

1826
01:48:00,375 --> 01:48:03,205
that can still go wrong
with this stunt.

1827
01:48:03,205 --> 01:48:05,715
Central Intelligence Agency.

1828
01:48:05,715 --> 01:48:09,925
Now, there's
a contradiction in terms.

1829
01:48:09,925 --> 01:48:12,925
How's the coffee, Ryan?

1830
01:48:12,925 --> 01:48:14,975
Dallas, this is the Mystic.

1831
01:48:14,975 --> 01:48:16,475
Request clearance for launch.

1832
01:48:16,475 --> 01:48:20,055
Mystic, Dallas.
You're cleared for launch.

1833
01:48:20,055 --> 01:48:21,565
Hatch is secured.

1834
01:48:21,565 --> 01:48:24,065
Life support, normal.
Prelaunch checks complete.

1835
01:48:24,065 --> 01:48:25,565
We're ready to launch.

1836
01:48:25,565 --> 01:48:26,605
Aye.

1837
01:48:26,605 --> 01:48:27,565
Flood the skirt.

1838
01:48:27,565 --> 01:48:28,985
Flood the skirt. Aye.

1839
01:48:28,985 --> 01:48:30,905
Skirt's filled and equalized.

1840
01:48:30,905 --> 01:48:33,405
Soft seal.
Ready to lift off.

1841
01:48:33,405 --> 01:48:37,245
OK. Let's do it.

1842
01:48:37,245 --> 01:48:39,245
We're off.

1843
01:48:39,245 --> 01:49:01,805
Thrusting port.

1844
01:49:01,805 --> 01:49:04,315
600 yards and closing.

1845
01:49:04,315 --> 01:49:07,105
Steer right to course 0-7-5.

1846
01:49:07,105 --> 01:49:12,025
400.

1847
01:49:12,025 --> 01:49:16,365
200 yards.

1848
01:49:16,365 --> 01:49:25,495
100 yards.

1849
01:49:25,495 --> 01:49:40,305
Hit the lights.

1850
01:49:40,305 --> 01:49:59,245
Jesus, that's a big sucker.

1851
01:49:59,245 --> 01:50:01,495
OK, we're in position.

1852
01:50:01,495 --> 01:50:04,245
You can open the hatch.

1853
01:50:04,245 --> 01:50:05,835
Hold it a second.

1854
01:50:05,835 --> 01:50:09,005
Jonesy.

1855
01:50:09,005 --> 01:50:13,675
Mr. Ryan.

1856
01:50:13,675 --> 01:50:16,425
He's defecting.

1857
01:50:16,425 --> 01:50:18,885
And he can't change his mind?

1858
01:50:18,885 --> 01:50:21,435
He's not going
to change his mind.

1859
01:50:21,435 --> 01:50:43,915
You willing
to bet your life on that?

1860
01:50:43,915 --> 01:50:46,535
Uh, sir, could you
hand me that hammer?

1861
01:50:46,535 --> 01:51:10,105
Yeah.

1862
01:51:10,105 --> 01:53:20,105
Americans.

1863
01:53:20,105 --> 01:53:23,195
What's so funny?

1864
01:53:23,195 --> 01:53:25,735
Well, the captain
seems to think

1865
01:53:25,735 --> 01:53:42,045
you're some sort of cowboy.

1866
01:53:42,045 --> 01:53:45,555
It is.

1867
01:53:45,555 --> 01:53:47,055
I doubt you'd remember,

1868
01:53:47,055 --> 01:53:50,555
but we met once
at the consulate in Leningrad.

1869
01:53:50,555 --> 01:53:52,855
Along with your wife.

1870
01:53:52,855 --> 01:53:56,935
I'm very sorry.

1871
01:53:56,935 --> 01:54:01,945
What gives you the right
to fire on my ship?

1872
01:54:01,945 --> 01:54:04,825
Your signal said nothing
of a torpedo.

1873
01:54:04,825 --> 01:54:07,405
Ryan.

1874
01:54:07,405 --> 01:54:10,825
It was necessary to maintain
the illusion for your crew.

1875
01:54:10,825 --> 01:54:13,325
My crew are being rescued, yes?

1876
01:54:13,325 --> 01:54:19,045
As we speak.

1877
01:54:19,045 --> 01:54:21,125
You sent the signal.

1878
01:54:21,125 --> 01:54:24,425
That's correct, sir.

1879
01:54:24,425 --> 01:54:30,595
Then how did you know
our reactor accident was false?

1880
01:54:30,595 --> 01:54:40,355
Well, that was a guess,
but it seemed logical.

1881
01:54:40,355 --> 01:54:45,525
Very well.

1882
01:54:45,525 --> 01:54:48,155
I present you

1883
01:54:48,155 --> 01:54:55,415
the ballistic missile
submarine Red October.

1884
01:54:55,415 --> 01:55:00,165
My officers and I
request asylum...

1885
01:55:00,165 --> 01:55:04,635
in the United States
of America.

1886
01:55:04,635 --> 01:55:06,795
It's a pleasure, sir.

1887
01:55:06,795 --> 01:55:11,925
Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1888
01:55:11,925 --> 01:55:14,975
Torpedo. The Americans
are shooting at us again.

1889
01:55:14,975 --> 01:55:16,975
The pitch is too high.

1890
01:55:16,975 --> 01:55:19,145
The torpedo's Russian.

1891
01:55:19,145 --> 01:55:21,895
Where the hell
did it come from?

1892
01:55:21,895 --> 01:55:24,145
Conn, Sonar.
New contact. Sierra 4-1.

1893
01:55:24,145 --> 01:55:29,405
Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1894
01:55:29,405 --> 01:55:31,365
Why don't I have a detonation?

1895
01:55:31,365 --> 01:55:34,745
The weapon enabled
on the far side of the target.

1896
01:55:34,745 --> 01:55:36,745
It passed Red October
before arming.

1897
01:55:36,745 --> 01:55:40,205
Fire again with the right settings
and reload both tubes.

1898
01:55:40,205 --> 01:55:43,125
Get me power.
Get that damn thing off my boat.

1899
01:55:43,125 --> 01:55:45,295
It's off.

1900
01:55:45,295 --> 01:55:48,005
I think somebody
shot a torpedo at us.

1901
01:55:48,005 --> 01:55:50,345
No shit, Buckwheat.
Get out of here.

1902
01:55:50,345 --> 01:56:05,695
Where am I...

1903
01:56:05,695 --> 01:56:09,405
Borodin, fire control.

1904
01:56:09,405 --> 01:56:10,525
Uh, Ryan.

1905
01:56:10,525 --> 01:56:11,615
Sit here.

1906
01:56:11,615 --> 01:56:14,785
I'm not a naval officer.
I'm with the CIA.

1907
01:56:14,785 --> 01:56:15,745
CIA?

1908
01:56:15,745 --> 01:56:17,285
I'm not an agent.

1909
01:56:17,285 --> 01:56:19,785
I just write books
for the CIA.

1910
01:56:19,785 --> 01:56:21,335
Whatever. Sit down.

1911
01:56:21,335 --> 01:56:23,455
And do exactly what I tell you.

1912
01:56:23,455 --> 01:56:24,715
DSRVs away.

1913
01:56:24,715 --> 01:56:27,085
There's a Russian alfa
8,000 yards to starboard.

1914
01:56:27,085 --> 01:56:28,925
I think it's the Konovalov.

1915
01:56:28,925 --> 01:56:30,465
Increase the flank.

1916
01:56:30,465 --> 01:56:32,555
Increase the flank.

1917
01:56:32,555 --> 01:56:34,635
How?

1918
01:56:34,635 --> 01:56:38,725
That knob. Turn right full.

1919
01:56:38,725 --> 01:56:40,975
All ahead flank.
Right full rudder.

1920
01:56:40,975 --> 01:56:42,515
He's shooting again, sir.

1921
01:56:42,515 --> 01:56:44,025
Go to battle stations.

1922
01:56:44,025 --> 01:56:44,985
Battle stations.

1923
01:56:44,985 --> 01:56:51,235
Chief of Watch,
man battle stations.

1924
01:56:51,235 --> 01:56:53,235
Torpedo in the water.

1925
01:56:53,235 --> 01:56:54,535
Bearing 3-1-5.

1926
01:56:54,535 --> 01:56:55,905
Make range 7,000 yards.

1927
01:56:55,905 --> 01:56:58,325
Steer right 3-1-5.

1928
01:56:58,325 --> 01:57:00,455
That's heading
into the torpedo.

1929
01:57:00,455 --> 01:57:02,495
Steady,
bearing still 3-1-5.

1930
01:57:02,495 --> 01:57:04,625
Estimated range...
6,000 yards.

1931
01:57:04,625 --> 01:57:06,255
Still 3-1-5.

1932
01:57:06,255 --> 01:57:09,005
Steer right
till this reads 3-1-5.

1933
01:57:09,005 --> 01:57:13,635
No, that's wrong.
Ryan, don't turn that goddamn wheel.

1934
01:57:13,635 --> 01:57:26,235
3-1-5.

1935
01:57:26,235 --> 01:57:29,905
You're heading straight
into that torpedo.

1936
01:57:29,905 --> 01:57:31,315
Yes.

1937
01:57:31,315 --> 01:57:32,615
Doing what?

1938
01:57:32,615 --> 01:57:34,575
He's turned
into the torpedo's path.

1939
01:57:34,575 --> 01:57:36,325
What?

1940
01:57:36,325 --> 01:57:39,365
Red October's turned directly
into the torpedo's path, sir.

1941
01:57:39,365 --> 01:57:40,785
Mother of God.

1942
01:57:40,785 --> 01:57:43,245
Torpedo steady,
bearing 3-1-5.

1943
01:57:43,245 --> 01:57:44,745
Range...5,000 yards.

1944
01:57:44,745 --> 01:57:50,625
Melekhin, more speed.

1945
01:57:50,625 --> 01:57:53,425
Estimate range 3,000 yards.

1946
01:57:53,425 --> 01:58:01,975
Closing awfully fast.

1947
01:58:01,975 --> 01:58:04,515
What's he trying to do,
kill himself?

1948
01:58:04,515 --> 01:58:07,565
We have a firing solution
on the Russian alfa.

1949
01:58:07,565 --> 01:58:09,025
Can we shoot back?

1950
01:58:09,025 --> 01:58:10,565
They didn't shoot at us.

1951
01:58:10,565 --> 01:58:15,655
I can't attack a Soviet submarine
without authorization.

1952
01:58:15,655 --> 01:58:17,865
Torpedo bearing steady at 3-1-5.

1953
01:58:17,865 --> 01:58:21,745
Best range... 900 yards.

1954
01:58:21,745 --> 01:58:26,915
Torpedo impact...
20 seconds.

1955
01:58:26,915 --> 01:58:29,665
What books?

1956
01:58:29,665 --> 01:58:31,045
Pardon me.

1957
01:58:31,045 --> 01:58:34,385
What books did you write?

1958
01:58:34,385 --> 01:58:38,675
I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey
called The Fighting Sailor,

1959
01:58:38,675 --> 01:58:40,425
about naval combat tactics.

1960
01:58:40,425 --> 01:58:42,015
I know this book.

1961
01:58:42,015 --> 01:58:43,015
Torpedo impact...

1962
01:58:43,015 --> 01:58:45,515
Your conclusions
were all wrong, Ryan.

1963
01:58:45,515 --> 01:58:46,515
10 seconds.

1964
01:58:46,515 --> 01:58:48,815
Halsey acted stupidly.

1965
01:58:48,815 --> 01:58:50,145
9...

1966
01:58:50,145 --> 01:58:51,315
8...

1967
01:58:51,315 --> 01:58:53,025
7...

1968
01:58:53,025 --> 01:58:54,155
6...

1969
01:58:54,155 --> 01:58:55,195
5...

1970
01:58:55,195 --> 01:58:56,825
4...

1971
01:58:56,825 --> 01:58:58,115
3...

1972
01:58:58,115 --> 01:58:59,075
2...

1973
01:58:59,075 --> 01:59:01,905
Torpedo impact...

1974
01:59:01,905 --> 01:59:12,375
now.

1975
01:59:12,375 --> 01:59:16,175
I'll be damned.

1976
01:59:16,175 --> 01:59:17,755
What happened?

1977
01:59:17,755 --> 01:59:20,305
Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

1978
01:59:20,305 --> 01:59:22,305
By turning into the torpedo,

1979
01:59:22,305 --> 01:59:24,305
the captain closed the distance

1980
01:59:24,305 --> 01:59:26,765
before it could arm itself.

1981
01:59:26,765 --> 01:59:28,685
So that's it?

1982
01:59:28,685 --> 01:59:29,895
Not quite.

1983
01:59:29,895 --> 01:59:31,435
Right now, Captain Tupolev

1984
01:59:31,435 --> 01:59:34,905
is removing the safety
features on all his weapons.

1985
01:59:34,905 --> 01:59:37,905
He won't make
the same mistake twice.

1986
01:59:37,905 --> 01:59:40,735
Vasily, have you
plotted a solution yet?

1987
01:59:40,735 --> 01:59:49,625
Aye, Captain.
It's a little rough, but I...

1988
01:59:49,625 --> 01:59:50,795
Gunfire?

1989
01:59:50,795 --> 01:59:52,965
That's what it sounded like, sir.

1990
01:59:52,965 --> 01:59:54,585
Won't change his mind?

1991
01:59:54,585 --> 01:59:56,085
It's one of the crew.

1992
01:59:56,085 --> 02:00:16,605
Well, whoever he is,
he's having second thoughts.

1993
02:00:16,605 --> 02:00:32,875
I would like
to have seen Montana.

1994
02:00:32,875 --> 02:00:35,965
Captain, he stumbled forward
into the missile bay.

1995
02:00:35,965 --> 02:00:38,045
There's a silo hatch warning...

1996
02:00:38,045 --> 02:00:39,595
port side, number 20.

1997
02:00:39,595 --> 02:00:41,175
He can't launch a missile.

1998
02:00:41,175 --> 02:00:46,015
No, but he can blow one up.

1999
02:00:46,015 --> 02:00:47,515
Captain, take the conn.

2000
02:00:47,515 --> 02:00:49,355
Fire control's blasted to hell.

2001
02:00:49,355 --> 02:00:51,765
Then get behind him
and stay there.

2002
02:00:51,765 --> 02:00:56,355
Captain, wait.

2003
02:00:56,355 --> 02:01:02,025
You may need this, sir.

2004
02:01:02,025 --> 02:01:06,155
Thank you.

2005
02:01:06,155 --> 02:01:09,165
Don't just stand there, Ryan.
Go with him!

2006
02:01:09,165 --> 02:01:10,665
You, you speak English?

2007
02:01:10,665 --> 02:01:11,705
Yes, sir.

2008
02:01:11,705 --> 02:01:13,545
Get your butt over here.

2009
02:01:13,545 --> 02:01:16,215
Captain, torpedo
broke off on impact.

2010
02:01:16,215 --> 02:01:18,505
Set the safety ranges
for zero.

2011
02:01:18,505 --> 02:01:20,385
I cannot go any faster.

2012
02:01:20,385 --> 02:01:21,845
We must get him

2013
02:01:21,845 --> 02:01:32,015
before he gets to
the ignition circuits.

2014
02:01:32,015 --> 02:01:35,525
What happens if he gets
to that ignition circuitry?

2015
02:01:35,525 --> 02:01:45,785
He can incinerate the ship.

2016
02:01:45,785 --> 02:01:49,705
Is that door
the only way out of here?

2017
02:01:49,705 --> 02:01:50,955
Yes.

2018
02:01:50,955 --> 02:01:54,455
Don't let him get past you.

2019
02:01:54,455 --> 02:01:56,255
Hey, Ryan.

2020
02:01:56,255 --> 02:01:59,715
Be careful
what you shoot at, hmm?

2021
02:01:59,715 --> 02:02:01,215
Most things in here

2022
02:02:01,215 --> 02:02:06,675
don't react too well
to bullets.

2023
02:02:06,675 --> 02:02:26,535
Right.

2024
02:02:26,535 --> 02:02:37,755
I have to be careful
what I shoot at?

2025
02:02:37,755 --> 02:02:39,715
Safety ranges set to zero.

2026
02:02:39,715 --> 02:02:42,755
Sonar, give me the bearing
for Red October.

2027
02:02:42,755 --> 02:02:44,255
She's positioned behind us.

2028
02:02:44,255 --> 02:02:45,715
Right full rudder!

2029
02:02:45,715 --> 02:02:54,015
I'll shake the man loose.

2030
02:02:54,015 --> 02:02:55,145
He's going deep.

2031
02:02:55,145 --> 02:02:56,725
30 degree down angle!

2032
02:02:56,725 --> 02:02:59,565
All the countermeasures
were over there, right?

2033
02:02:59,565 --> 02:03:25,965
Very well.

2034
02:03:25,965 --> 02:03:27,965
Admiral,
the alfa's too quick.

2035
02:03:27,965 --> 02:03:30,135
It's only a matter of time.

2036
02:03:30,135 --> 02:03:32,845
"Ryan, some things in here

2037
02:03:32,845 --> 02:03:34,805
don't react well to bullets".

2038
02:03:34,805 --> 02:03:35,725
Yeah.

2039
02:03:35,725 --> 02:03:37,105
Like me.

2040
02:03:37,105 --> 02:03:55,825
I don't react well to bullets.

2041
02:03:55,825 --> 02:03:58,165
Aah!

2042
02:03:58,165 --> 02:03:59,335
Where's he now?

2043
02:03:59,335 --> 02:04:03,965
Close, sir.

2044
02:04:03,965 --> 02:04:06,085
900 meters, directly ahead.

2045
02:04:06,085 --> 02:04:07,175
Got him.

2046
02:04:07,175 --> 02:04:08,715
Match bearings and fire.

2047
02:04:08,715 --> 02:04:10,215
We are too close!

2048
02:04:10,215 --> 02:04:12,175
Don't argue.
Launch the weapon.

2049
02:04:12,175 --> 02:04:15,055
The torpedoes are armed
in the tubes! You cannot...

2050
02:04:15,055 --> 02:04:17,685
Do it now!

2051
02:04:17,685 --> 02:04:21,355
Another torpedo. It went active
the moment it was launched.

2052
02:04:21,355 --> 02:04:24,775
Left full rudder.
Ease off on your bow planes.

2053
02:04:24,775 --> 02:04:35,955
I think he's got us.

2054
02:04:35,955 --> 02:04:43,255
Way to go, Dallas!

2055
02:04:43,255 --> 02:04:44,875
Torpedo is in acquisition.

2056
02:04:44,875 --> 02:04:46,875
Range 500 yards and closing.

2057
02:04:46,875 --> 02:04:48,925
You've done it, Mr. Thompson!

2058
02:04:48,925 --> 02:04:50,385
I hope this works.

2059
02:04:50,385 --> 02:04:52,885
Chief, put us on the roof.

2060
02:04:52,885 --> 02:04:59,355
Countermeasure station,
on my mark. 5, 4...

2061
02:04:59,355 --> 02:05:01,265
1. Release countermeasures.

2062
02:05:01,265 --> 02:05:02,565
Emergency blow!

2063
02:05:02,565 --> 02:05:10,065
Full rise. Fair water plane.

2064
02:05:10,065 --> 02:05:11,405
600 feet.

2065
02:05:11,405 --> 02:05:13,195
550...

2066
02:05:13,195 --> 02:05:15,285
500 feet.

2067
02:05:15,285 --> 02:05:16,245
450...

2068
02:05:16,245 --> 02:05:37,725
Come on, big D. Fly.

2069
02:05:37,725 --> 02:05:39,225
That torpedo's still active.

2070
02:05:39,225 --> 02:06:06,505
It's searching
for another target.

2071
02:06:06,505 --> 02:06:37,285
A goddamn cook!

2072
02:06:37,285 --> 02:06:39,825
How close is that alfa, Jonesy?

2073
02:06:39,825 --> 02:06:41,415
1,000 yards, going to port.

2074
02:06:41,415 --> 02:06:48,705
Reverse your turn.

2075
02:06:48,705 --> 02:06:51,215
We're turning straight at him.

2076
02:06:51,215 --> 02:06:56,925
Torpedo's still on our tail.

2077
02:06:56,925 --> 02:06:59,515
The hard part
about playing chicken

2078
02:06:59,515 --> 02:07:07,145
is knowing when to flinch.

2079
02:07:07,145 --> 02:07:08,685
Collision in 400 yards.

2080
02:07:08,685 --> 02:07:09,935
350...

2081
02:07:09,935 --> 02:07:11,105
300...

2082
02:07:11,105 --> 02:07:12,855
Captain!

2083
02:07:12,855 --> 02:07:15,865
Right full rudder,
30 degree down angle.

2084
02:07:15,865 --> 02:07:17,195
Aye, sir.

2085
02:07:17,195 --> 02:07:23,535
This one's going to be close.

2086
02:07:23,535 --> 02:07:25,035
Torpedo dead ahead!

2087
02:07:25,035 --> 02:07:55,405
You arrogant ass.
You've killed us.

2088
02:07:55,405 --> 02:07:57,945
We have ascertained
the Red October's

2089
02:07:57,945 --> 02:08:00,115
final position, but...

2090
02:08:00,115 --> 02:08:02,245
given the depth of the water

2091
02:08:02,245 --> 02:08:04,245
and the fact that the wreckage

2092
02:08:04,245 --> 02:08:06,325
spreads across a wide area,

2093
02:08:06,325 --> 02:08:09,245
it'll be some time before
anything's recovered.

2094
02:08:09,245 --> 02:08:12,255
However, your people
are interviewing the crew now

2095
02:08:12,255 --> 02:08:14,835
and making arrangements
for their return.

2096
02:08:14,835 --> 02:08:17,795
This has been a terrible tragedy,
Mr. Ambassador.

2097
02:08:17,795 --> 02:08:19,805
And I can only stress

2098
02:08:19,805 --> 02:08:22,805
that if you'd come to us earlier

2099
02:08:22,805 --> 02:08:24,805
it might have been avoided.

2100
02:08:24,805 --> 02:08:27,805
I appreciate your candor
in the matter.

2101
02:08:27,805 --> 02:08:33,855
And I yours, Andrei.

2102
02:08:33,855 --> 02:08:35,315
Perhaps in the future

2103
02:08:35,315 --> 02:08:38,445
technology will allow
a more thorough investigation

2104
02:08:38,445 --> 02:08:39,775
of the wreckage.

2105
02:08:39,775 --> 02:08:47,745
Perhaps.

2106
02:08:47,745 --> 02:08:49,955
There is another matter...

2107
02:08:49,955 --> 02:08:52,125
one that I'm reluctant to...

2108
02:08:52,125 --> 02:08:55,335
Please.

2109
02:08:55,335 --> 02:08:57,885
One of our submarines...
an alfa...

2110
02:08:57,885 --> 02:09:02,175
was last reported in the area
of the Grand Banks.

2111
02:09:02,175 --> 02:09:08,305
We have not heard
from her for some time.

2112
02:09:08,305 --> 02:09:10,805
Andrei.

2113
02:09:10,805 --> 02:09:27,655
You've lost another submarine?

2114
02:09:27,655 --> 02:09:32,085
All this way to hide
a submarine in a river.

2115
02:09:32,085 --> 02:09:35,375
We're 100 miles
from the nearest naval base,

2116
02:09:35,375 --> 02:09:40,585
the last place
that satellites will ever look.

2117
02:09:40,585 --> 02:09:44,555
I grew up around here.

2118
02:09:44,555 --> 02:09:47,135
My grandfather taught me to fish

2119
02:09:47,135 --> 02:09:53,015
off that island right over there.

2120
02:09:53,015 --> 02:09:54,525
There's one question

2121
02:09:54,525 --> 02:09:58,355
you haven't asked me yet.

2122
02:09:58,355 --> 02:10:02,025
Why?

2123
02:10:02,025 --> 02:10:07,245
Well, I figured you would tell me
when you were ready.

2124
02:10:07,245 --> 02:10:09,785
Now, there are
those who believe

2125
02:10:09,785 --> 02:10:12,745
we should attack
the United States first,

2126
02:10:12,745 --> 02:10:15,545
settle everything
in one moment.

2127
02:10:15,545 --> 02:10:18,585
Red October was built
for that purpose.

2128
02:10:18,585 --> 02:10:21,085
When the dust settles
from this,

2129
02:10:21,085 --> 02:10:24,135
there's going to be
hell to pay in Moscow.

2130
02:10:24,135 --> 02:10:25,305
Well, perhaps.

2131
02:10:25,305 --> 02:10:28,265
Maybe something good
will come from it.

2132
02:10:28,265 --> 02:10:30,765
A little revolution,
now and then,

2133
02:10:30,765 --> 02:10:39,985
is a healthy thing,
don't you think?

2134
02:10:39,985 --> 02:10:42,445
Do you still like to fish, Ryan?

2135
02:10:42,445 --> 02:10:45,155
Mm-hmm.

2136
02:10:45,155 --> 02:10:48,115
There's a river,
not unlike this one,

2137
02:10:48,115 --> 02:10:49,155
near Vilnius,

2138
02:10:49,155 --> 02:10:55,205
where my grandfather
taught me to fish.

2139
02:10:55,205 --> 02:11:00,005
"And the sea will grant
each man new hope

2140
02:11:00,005 --> 02:11:09,975
as sleep brings dreams of home".

2141
02:11:09,975 --> 02:11:16,475
Christopher Columbus.

2142
02:11:16,475 --> 02:11:28,735
Welcome to the New World, sir.

2143
02:11:28,735 --> 02:11:30,405
Everything all right, sir?
