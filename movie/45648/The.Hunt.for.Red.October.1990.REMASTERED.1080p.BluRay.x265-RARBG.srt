00:00:22,157 --> 00:00:23,737
戈尔巴乔夫上台前夕

4
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:25,026
一艘苏联台风级潜艇

5
00:00:25,112 --> 00:00:26,800
在大浅滩以南  浮上海面

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,675
潜艇后来下沉深海

7
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,864
显然是发生了辐射意外

8
00:00:33,868 --> 00:00:34,780
部分船员获救

9
00:00:34,925 --> 00:00:35,863
但报导未经证实

的确是时候了
Time indeed.

21
00:04:47,647 --> 00:04:49,586
你这儿在干什么?

00:04:49,586 --> 00:04:51,525
你应该在楼上睡觉

-斯坦利不断吵醒我  -原来是这样

24
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:02,078
-你越来越重了  -胡说
-You're getting heavy.  -Don't let her pull more than her usual nonsense.

25
00:05:02,245 --> 00:05:06,082
她最多只准喝两杯水  听两个故事  杰克...
Two stories. Two glasses of water. Jack...

26
00:05:06,249 --> 00:05:07,896
你快要错过班机了
You're going to miss the plane.

27
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:09,543
好的  宝贝  听话

31
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:20,846

-Will you promise?  -I promise.

32
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:58,426
-先生  有什么吩咐吗?  -没有  谢谢你

睡一觉吧
You know, if you try and get some sleep...

34
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:03,472
时间会过得快一点
the flight will go a lot faster.

35
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:07,184
在飞机上睡不着觉  我讨厌乱流
I can never sleep on a plane. Turbulence.

36
00:06:07,351 --> 00:06:10,563
-什么?  -乱流
-Pardon?  -Turbulence.

37
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,961
阳光照射地面
Solar radiation heats the earth's crust...

38
00:06:12,961 --> 00:06:15,192
热空气上升  冷空气下降
warm air rises, cool air descends.

39

-我不喜欢乱流  -还是睡一睡吧

杰克  小伙子  进来吧
Jack, boy, get yourself in here.

42

45
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:30,393
你一定不享受这次旅程
I'm not going to ask you how your flight went.

46
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,708
上次睡觉是什么时候?

不知道  这表还是伦敦时间

How's Caroline?

50
00:07:43,281 --> 00:07:46,284
上次见她还是在你爷爷家
Last time I saw her was at your granddad's place in Maine.

51
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:49,870
她很好  她向你致以问候
She's fine. She sends you her best.

他有三岁了吧
What is she now, three?

54
00:07:55,751 --> 00:07:59,797
五岁了  人小鬼大
No, she's a very precocious five.

55
00:07:59,964 --> 00:08:02,487
她说
She announced to Caroline...

56
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:05,011
如果我们买一个小弟弟...
and I the other day that her life would be less lonely...

57
00:08:05,177 --> 00:08:09,390
她就不会那么寂寞
if we were to buy her a baby brother.

58
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,976
后来她叫我们
But she decided it would be enough...

59
00:08:11,976 --> 00:08:14,395
给斯坦利买个弟弟
if we were to buy one for Stanley.

60
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:20,234
-谁是斯坦利?  -斯坦利是玩具熊
-Who's Stanley?  -Ah, Stanley's a bear.

61
00:08:22,194 --> 00:08:27,450
为什么半夜赶乘飞机来这里?
What's important enough to get you on a plane in the middle of the night?

62
00:08:27,617 --> 00:08:29,952
英国情报局两天前获得这些
British Intelligence obtained these pictures two days ago

63
00:08:29,952 --> 00:08:32,288
红十月号的照片

我去年调查过他
I did the bio on him last year.

68
00:08:47,448 --> 00:08:50,222
他负责测试各级新型潜艇10年了
He's taken out the lead boat in each new sub class for 10 years.

69
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:52,933
政治关系良好
Fairly good political connections.

70
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:55,478
大部分舰长都是由他一手训练
Trained most of their attack-boat skippers.

71
00:08:55,645 --> 00:08:59,690
苏联人叫他"维尔纽斯勒力"

74
00:09:08,616 --> 00:09:12,265
我不知道那是什么  英国人也不知道
I don't know what they are, neither do the British.

75
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:15,915
也许我们在摩尔曼斯克的朋友会有点头绪
Perhaps our friends in Murmansk have come up with something new.

76
00:09:16,082 --> 00:09:16,957
如果你同意的话

我想请泰勒舰长看看这些图片

79
00:09:19,752 --> 00:09:21,754
潜艇驾驶员?

80
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,756
后来遇上车祸  断了腿
He was. Clipped by a drunk driver. Lost his leg.

88
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:32,783
博蒙特  以前我们会一边睡觉一边监听
Beaumont, at Cal Tech we used to do this in our sleep.

89
00:10:32,783 --> 00:10:35,536
现在听到了吗?
You hear it now?

90
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:39,999
等一等  这声音...
Wait a minute. maybe...

91
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,502
-被水面的杂声盖过了?  -是的
-It's buried in surface clutter.  -Yes.

92
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:47,006
-用分析仪?  -对  博蒙特
-I should go to SAPS?  -Correct, Seaman Beaumont.

93
00:10:47,173 --> 00:10:50,843
使用信号分析系统
Signal Algorithmic Processing Systems.

94
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:54,597
一星期后  你就可以在学院任教
Give it a week and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

95
00:10:54,764 --> 00:10:59,852
像贝多芬一样
So, like Beethoven on the computer...

96
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:11,781
你用电脑创作生物乐章

97
00:11:12,907 --> 00:11:15,993
-什么?  -鲸鱼的声音  博蒙特
-A what?  -A whale. Beaumont. A whale...

98
00:11:16,994 --> 00:11:22,208
鲸鱼比你更熟悉声纳
A marine mammal that knows a lot more about sonar than you do.

99
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:27,546
关闭分析仪  转到269方位再听一次
Kill the SAPS. Train over to 269 and let's try it again.

00:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,659
我们没空聊海洋故事
We don't have time for sea stories.

102
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:39,600
我正在教博蒙特现代声纳的知识
I was in the middle of teaching Beaumont about modern sonar.

103
00:11:39,767 --> 00:11:42,707
我不是大副  我是森林女王
I ain't chief of the boat. I'm Sheena, Queen of the Jungle.

Cob, please.  Come on, Cob. Tell me.

00:11:50,611 --> 00:11:54,865
水兵琼斯是个超级音乐迷
Ahem... Seaman Jones here, he's into music in a big way.

107
00:11:55,032 --> 00:12:00,830
他把潜艇当作私人音乐厅
He figures this whole boat is basically just his own personal, private stereo set.

108
00:12:00,997 --> 00:12:03,395

拜托  这是我在讲故事
This is my story, OK?

111
00:12:08,296 --> 00:12:11,799
帕瓦罗蒂是男高音  帕格尼尼是作曲家
Pavarotti is a tenor. Paganini was a composer.

112
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:15,907
好  他正在用耳机听音乐
OK. So he's got this music, and he's got it out in the water.

113
00:12:15,907 --> 00:12:19,849
正偷着乐呢
He's listening on his headsets, happy as a clam.

114
00:12:20,016 --> 00:12:22,414
后来出事了
Then all hell breaks loose.

115
00:12:22,414 --> 00:12:24,812
圣地亚哥一整队军舰

117
00:12:26,282 --> 00:12:27,585
还有珍珠港一艘军舰
Including one way out at Pearl.

118
00:12:27,585 --> 00:12:30,192
他们突然听到...
All of a sudden, they start hearing...

119
00:12:30,359 --> 00:12:32,882
-帕瓦罗蒂  -帕瓦罗蒂的歌声
-Pavarotti.  -Pavarotti coming out of their asses.

120
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:35,406

121

方位097发现目标  指定呼叫是S-35
New contact bearing 097. Designate contact Sierra-35.

124
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:50,191
我是舰长  发现了什么  琼斯?
Captain, aye. What've you got, Jones?

125
00:12:50,191 --> 00:12:52,214
正在判别  可能是潜艇
Distant contact, probably submerged.

126
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,872
声音从远处传来
It's a wild guess, but...

127
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:55,363
我相信是巨兽出笼了
I'd say we hit a boomer, coming out of the barn.

128
00:12:55,363 --> 00:12:58,346
可能是波利尼湾的导弹潜艇
Could be a missile boat out of Polijarny.

129
00:13:00,681 --> 00:13:02,787
好的  开始追踪  我马上来
Ok. Start your track. I'll be there in a minute.

130
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,894
遵命

131
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:08,395
舰长  是时候启阅命令了
Time to open the orders, sir.

132
00:14:08,395 --> 00:14:11,711
那位政治委员已经进了舰长室
The Political Officer is in your cabin.

133
00:14:12,962 --> 00:14:14,505
好
Very well.

134
00:14:17,174 --> 00:14:19,260
你留在指挥室
Carry on.

135
00:14:37,445 --> 00:14:44,744
-你在干什么?  -监督全体船员的安定性
-What are you doing?  -Overseeing the stability of the crew.

136
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:49,999
所以侵犯我的隐私权?
By invading my privacy?

137
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:55,296
在苏联  私隐权并不重要
Privacy is not a major concern in the Soviet Union.

138
00:14:55,463 --> 00:14:59,216
私隐权经常与集体利益相抵触
It is often contrary to the collective good.

139
00:15:03,763 --> 00:15:12,313
"看  我像贼一样来临"
"Behold, I am coming as a thief."

140
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,462
"他们聚集在一起
"And they gathered them together...

141
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:18,444
在一个称为善恶决战场的地方"
in a place called Armageddon. "

142
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,406
"第七位天使把碗倒在空中
"The 7th angel poured forth his bowl...

143
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:25,534
天堂传来一个声音..."
and a voice cried out from Heaven..."

144
00:15:25,701 --> 00:15:29,330
"成了"
"It is done."

145
00:15:29,497 --> 00:15:34,710
你肩负重任  怎能听信末世预言
A man with your responsibilities reading about the end of the world.

146
00:15:34,877 --> 00:15:41,217
这是什么? "我是摧毁世界的死亡使者"
And what's this? "I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."

147
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:45,554
一位美国人引述的这段印度古文
It is an ancient Hindu text quoted by an American.

148
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:48,975
-美国人?  -他发明了原子弹
-An American?  -He invented the atomic bomb.

149
00:15:49,141 --> 00:15:52,728
后来被指为共产党员
He was latter accused of being a communist.

150
00:15:52,895 --> 00:15:56,524
你在这些句子下面划线  写字
You wrote and underlined these passages.

151
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:59,318
不是
No.

152
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:05,074
这是我妻子的遗物  我留作纪念
This book belonged to my wife. I keep it for sentimental value.

153
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:08,452
对不起  舰长  尊夫人很漂亮
I'm sorry, comrade Captain. Your wife was a beautiful woman.

154
00:16:08,619 --> 00:16:11,372
她的去世令人惋惜
Her death was unfortunate.

155
00:16:11,539 --> 00:16:16,711
我只不过是履行职责
I am only doing my job. It is my responsibility.

156
00:16:18,754 --> 00:16:22,133
克格勃派了多少特工到我的艇上?
How many agents did the KGB put aboard my boat?

157
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:25,198
-你的艇  舰长?  -是的
-Your boat, Captain?  -Yes.

158
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:28,097
这艘潜艇属于苏联人民
This vessel belongs to the people of the Soviet Union.

159
00:16:28,264 --> 00:16:32,685
如果艇上有克格勃或者情报局的特工
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU has agents aboard...

160
00:16:32,852 --> 00:16:36,147
我也不知情
I would be the last to know.

161
00:16:37,315 --> 00:16:41,986
启读命令吧  舰长
I suggest we open our orders, Captain.

162
00:16:42,153 --> 00:16:45,197
好的  同志
Certainly, comrade.

163
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:31,911
红旗北军潜艇部队
From Commander Strategic Submarine Forces Red Banner Northern Fleet.

164
00:17:32,078 --> 00:17:37,208
我们向北方  坐标54-90进发
We are to proceed north, to grid square 5490.

165
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:40,670
与雅夫级潜艇科诺瓦洛夫号会合
and rendezvous with Alfa submarine Konovalov.

166
00:17:40,670 --> 00:17:43,965
图波列夫的艇
Captain Tupolev's boat.

167
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:47,238
你认识图波列夫?
You know Tupolev?

168
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:48,792
我知道他是上层人物
I know he descends from aristocracy...

169
00:17:48,792 --> 00:17:50,346
也是你的门生
and that he was your student.

170
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:54,267
据说他特别敬重你
It's rumored he has a place in his heart for you.

171
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:59,981
图波列夫只会敬重他自己
There's little room in Tupolev's heart for anyone but Tupolev.

172
00:18:01,691 --> 00:18:04,944
会合后  两艘潜艇一起演习
Having made contact, we are to run a series of drills.

173
00:18:04,944 --> 00:18:08,197
图波列夫猎杀我们的潜艇
Tupolev will hunt us while we test our ship.

174
00:18:08,364 --> 00:18:12,326
我们测试履带式推进器
We are to evaluate the readiness of the caterpillar drive.

175
00:18:12,493 --> 00:18:17,415
然后在本月十六日返回波利尼湾
We return to Polijarny on or about the 16th of this month.

176
00:18:17,582 --> 00:18:20,147
舰长  这是一个历史时刻
Captain, This is an historic moment for all of us.

177
00:18:20,147 --> 00:18:22,712
我有一个请求
I should like to make a request.

178
00:18:22,878 --> 00:18:25,006
-在提出请求前...  -我知道这不合规矩
-Before you proceed...  -I know it's not protocol...

179
00:18:25,172 --> 00:18:27,528
但请让我
but would you permit me to...

180
00:18:27,528 --> 00:18:29,885
向船员公布任务
post our orders and inform the crew of our mission?

181
00:18:55,369 --> 00:18:59,290
我要去一个地方  你不能同行
Where I am going, you can not follow.

182
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:30,571
彼得罗夫医生  立刻来舰长室
Dr Petrov, report to my cabin immediately.

183
00:19:30,571 --> 00:19:33,407
这里发生了意外
There's been a dreadful accident.

184
00:19:39,407 --> 00:19:44,207
4号码头  美军船坞  马里兰州

185
00:20:03,207 --> 00:20:05,207
接着!
Hey, buddy!

186
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:21,455
下面没有支船架  快点动手
Listen to me. There's no cradle underneath it. Get it over。

187
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:27,003
别那么固执  上来帮我吧
Relax! Stop being an old maid. You want to come up here and do it yourself?

188
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,218
瑞恩  谁让你进来的?
Ryan! Who let you in here?

189
00:20:34,385 --> 00:20:38,848
他们叫你来砌模型?
Have they got you playing with models now?

190
00:20:39,015 --> 00:20:44,729
该死的  叫他慢下来
Damn it, Phil! Tell them to slow down.

191
00:20:45,855 --> 00:20:50,318
这不是模型  这是深潜救助艇
It's not a model. It's a DSRV. Rescue sub.

192
00:20:50,484 --> 00:20:51,944
我知道这是什么  我原来见过一艘
I know what it is. And I just need to see one before.

193
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:53,404
你拿它来做什么?
What are you doing with it?

194
00:20:53,571 --> 00:20:56,615
改装入坞设计
Ah, well, we're rigging it with a generic docking collar...

195
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:59,660
它可以配合各国潜艇
so it'll mate with British, German... just about anybody's sub.

196
00:20:59,827 --> 00:21:03,122
在24小时内赶到世界每个角落
We can get it anywhere in the world in 24 hours.

197
00:21:04,707 --> 00:21:10,755
-你的背没事吧?  -没事  有没有时间?
-How's your back?  -It's fine. Have you got a minute?

198
00:21:12,506 --> 00:21:16,886
比常规的台风级潜艇更大  这些是什么门?
It's bigger than a regular Typhoon. What are these doors?

199
00:21:17,053 --> 00:21:19,805
你真细心
You don't miss much, do you?

200
00:21:19,972 --> 00:21:24,060
它们比鱼雷发射管大
Those are too big to be torpedo tubes.

201
00:21:24,227 --> 00:21:26,291
用来发射洲际弹道导弹?
Can you launch an ICBM horizontally?

202
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,356
是的  你想问什么?
Sure. Why would you want to?

203
00:21:28,522 --> 00:21:34,070
它们是对称的  排在舰轴两边
They're symmetrical, right down the long axis of the sub.

204
00:21:34,237 --> 00:21:36,906
拖曳线阵列声纳呢?
How about a towed sonar array?

205
00:21:36,906 --> 00:21:39,575
肯定不是  太靠近螺旋桨了
Nope. Too close to the screws.

206
00:21:39,742 --> 00:21:42,870
怎么会...
I'll be...

207
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:45,957
这可能是履带
This could be a caterpillar.

208
00:21:46,123 --> 00:21:48,688
什么?
A what?

209
00:21:48,688 --> 00:21:51,254
履带驱动  磁性压水式推进器
Uh, a caterpillar drive. Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

210
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,714
-明白吗?  -不明白
-Do you follow?  -No.

211
00:21:53,881 --> 00:21:58,344
它就像水中的喷射引擎
It's like a jet engine for the water.

212
00:21:58,511 --> 00:22:00,992
靠向后的反冲推进
Goes in the front, gets squirted out the back.

213
00:22:00,992 --> 00:22:03,474
没有运动部件  所以非常的安静
Only it's got no moving parts, so it's very, very quiet.

214
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:06,206
有多安静?
Like how quiet?

215
00:22:06,206 --> 00:22:08,771
我们的声纳绝对发现不了它
It's doubtful our sonar would even pick it up.

216
00:22:08,938 --> 00:22:10,502
听起来像是鲸鱼游动
And if it did, it would sound like whales humping...

217
00:22:10,502 --> 00:22:12,066
或是地壳震动
or a seismic anomaly.

218
00:22:12,066 --> 00:22:15,194
一点也不像潜艇
Anything but a submarine.

219
00:22:15,361 --> 00:22:18,823
我们数年前研制这种潜艇
We messed with this a couple of years ago.

220
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:22,285
但未成功
Couldn't make it work.

221
00:22:22,451 --> 00:22:24,300
他们成功了?
They really built this?

222
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,149
这不是个模型吧?
This isn't a mock-up or anything.

223
00:22:26,149 --> 00:22:27,999
它今早出海了
She put to sea this morning.

224
00:22:33,838 --> 00:22:38,426
十二岁时  我帮爸爸建造防空洞
When I was twelve, I helped my daddy build a bomb shelter in our basement...

225
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:44,682
因为有人打算向佛罗里达州发射导弹
because some fool parked a dozen warheads 90 miles off the coast of Florida.

226
00:22:44,849 --> 00:22:49,145
这东西能向华盛顿和纽约  发射二百枚导弹
This thing could park 200 warheads off Washington or New York...

227
00:22:49,312 --> 00:22:55,484
而且神不知鬼不觉
and no one would know anything about it until it was all over.

228
00:23:05,161 --> 00:23:08,497
-舰长  你没事吧?  -没事
-Are you all right, Captain?  -Oh, yes.

229
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:13,210
被地上的茶水滑了一跤  竟然断送生命
It's just to die for something as petty as slipping on tea.

230
00:23:13,377 --> 00:23:15,587
你不必自责  舰长  这是个意外
You're blaming yourself, Captain. It was an accident.

231
00:23:15,587 --> 00:23:17,798
回基地后你的心情自然会平复
You'll feel better when we put in.

232
00:23:17,965 --> 00:23:21,427
-平复?  -嗯  回基地后  舰长
-Put in?  -Well, to base, Captain.

233
00:23:21,594 --> 00:23:23,373
我们不能没有政治委员
We cannot go on without a political officer.

234
00:23:23,373 --> 00:23:25,552
医生  这是艘苏联战舰
Doctor, this is a combat vessel of the Soviet Navy.

235
00:23:25,652 --> 00:23:29,879
而我是个资深舰长
And I'm a senior combat officer.

236
00:23:29,879 --> 00:23:34,607
我们不能为这意外撤销任务
We do not cancel operations because of accidents.

237
00:23:34,774 --> 00:23:40,363
水兵  过来  过来
Seaman, come here. Come here.

238
00:23:41,364 --> 00:23:45,826
-你叫什么名字?  -副厨师洛吉诺夫
-Your name?  -Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.

239
00:23:45,993 --> 00:23:49,830
好  你和医生来当见证人
Good. I want you and the doctor to witness this.

240
00:23:49,997 --> 00:23:53,271
我要解除政治委员的导弹钥匙
I'm removing the Political Officer's missile key carry on...

241
00:23:53,271 --> 00:23:56,545
并由我来保管
and I'm keeping it by myself.

242
00:23:56,712 --> 00:24:00,383
舰长  我认为这得请示红旗舰队总司令
Captain, I think we should report this to Red Fleet Command.

243
00:24:00,549 --> 00:24:03,364
这恐怕不行  医生
I'm afraid that's impossible, Doctor.

244
00:24:03,364 --> 00:24:06,180
我们必须保持无线电静默
Our orders are for strict radio silence.

245
00:24:06,347 --> 00:24:11,561
-你可以走了  -这样不太好  舰长
-That's all, Loginov.  -This is most unnerving, Captain.

246
00:24:11,727 --> 00:24:15,585
发出两条钥匙
The reason for having two missile keys...

247
00:24:15,585 --> 00:24:19,443
就是为了避免...
is so that no one man may...

248
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:24,782
-避免什么?  -避免一人控制导弹
-May what?  -May arm the missiles.

249
00:24:24,949 --> 00:24:27,159
也许我应该控制钥匙
Perhaps I should keep the key.

250
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:29,370
谢谢你  医生  你可以走了
Thank you. That'll be all, Doctor.

251
00:24:29,537 --> 00:24:35,209
我将会发布指令  到时候你就会明白
When I address the crew, then you will understand.

252
00:24:38,546 --> 00:24:45,553
彼得罗夫  我不会向中央报告你的言论
Petrov, I will try to forget your comments when I present my report.

253
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,889
谢谢  舰长
Thank you, sir.

254
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:59,650
在方位310  速度12节  距离20000码
Holding steady on 310. 12 knots at about 20,000 yards.

255
00:24:59,817 --> 00:25:04,864
-有没有资料?  -电脑正在分析
-Have you got a make on it?  -The computer is chewing on it, sir.

256
00:25:04,931 --> 00:25:08,326
双螺旋桨  像是台风级潜艇
Twin screws. The plant noise sounds like a typhoon.

257
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,200
是艘新型潜艇  舰长
I'd say we got a new boat, sir.

258
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:21,338
汤姆  最近几天总部有没有新消息?
Tommy, I miss something on the boards last few days?

259
00:25:21,338 --> 00:25:24,258
没有新的潜艇记录
Sub plant hasn't said anything about it.

260
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:31,474
-电脑记录了多少台风级潜艇?  -6艘
-All right. How many Typhoons are listed?  -Six, sir.

261
00:25:31,641 --> 00:25:33,684
好的  称它为"台风七号"
OK. Call this guy Typhoon Seven.

262
00:25:33,684 --> 00:25:35,727
靠近点开始监听
Start a tape on him. See if we can work in a little closer.

263
00:25:35,727 --> 00:25:37,772
遵命  长官
Yes, sir.

264
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:42,610
它会听到我们吗?
Won't he hear us?

265
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:45,863
潜艇有听觉盲点  博蒙特
Not if we stay in his baffles, Seaman Beaumont.

266
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:49,992
他们听不见螺旋桨背后的声音
Come in behind his propeller and he's deaf as a post.

267
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:21,669
声纳有新发现吗?
Any sonar contacts, Mr.Kamarov?

268
00:26:21,669 --> 00:26:24,902
没有新发现  舰长
No contacts, Captain. The sonar is clear.

269
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:27,238
海面有没有发现船只  鲍罗丁?
Good. Do we have any surface contacts, Mr. Borodin?

270
00:26:27,238 --> 00:26:29,407
没有任何目标
No contacts, sir. Scope is clear.

271
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:34,036
好  我要向船员说明任务
Good. Then it's time I explain our orders to the crew.

272
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:38,499
同志们  我是舰长
Comrades, this is your captain.

273
00:26:38,666 --> 00:26:41,794
我感到很荣幸
It is an honor to speak to you today...

274
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:44,484
我们驾驶祖国最先进的潜艇
and I'm honored to be sailing with you on the maiden voyage...

275
00:26:44,484 --> 00:26:47,008
作首次航行
of our motherland's most recent achievement.

276
00:26:47,174 --> 00:26:52,096
我们将再玩一个危险游戏
And once more, we play our dangerous game.

277
00:26:52,263 --> 00:26:58,060
跟我们的老对手美国海军  一较高下
A game of chess, against our old adversary the American Navy.

278
00:26:58,227 --> 00:27:01,835
四十年来  你们的父亲和兄长
For 40 years, your fathers before you...

279
00:27:01,835 --> 00:27:05,443
一直跟他们周旋
and your older brothers played this game and played it well.

280
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,990
但现在情况转变了  我们占有优势
But today the game is different. We have the advantage.

281
00:27:11,157 --> 00:27:15,328
我想起我们昔日的人造地球卫星和尤里・加加林
It reminds me of the heady days of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin.

282
00:27:15,494 --> 00:27:18,915
我们的火箭令世界震惊
when the world trembled at the sound of our rockets.

283
00:27:19,081 --> 00:27:22,585
我们的无声潜艇  也会令世界震惊
It will tremble again at the sound of our silence.

284
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,839
-命令:以无声推进系统潜航  -是  舰长
The order is: Engage the silent drive.  -Aye, sir.

285
00:27:27,006 --> 00:27:30,843
-水柜控制  开启外门  -外门开启
Ballast control, open outer doors.  -Yes, open outer doors.

286
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:34,305
潜水官  关闭主引擎  使用履带推进
Diving command. Engage caterpillar and secure main engines.

287
00:27:38,935 --> 00:27:41,020
正在开门  舰长
Doors opening, Captain.

288
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:45,191
同志们  我们的舰队也不知道我们的威力
Comrades, our own fleet doesn't know our full potential.

289
00:27:45,358 --> 00:27:48,152
他们想尽一切办法测试我们
They will do everything possible to test us,

290
00:27:48,319 --> 00:27:50,884
他们最终只会自惭形秽
but they will only test their own embarrassment.

291
00:27:50,884 --> 00:27:53,449
我们将撇下其他舰只
We will leave our fleet behind.

292
00:27:53,616 --> 00:27:58,120
无声无息地穿过美国舰队的巡逻  穿过他们的声纳网
We will pass through the American patrols pass their sonar nets...

293
00:27:58,287 --> 00:28:03,417
进入各大城市  一边听美国摇滚乐
and lay off their largest city and listen to their rock 'n' roll...

294
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:06,671
一边进行导弹演习
while we conduct missile drills.

295
00:28:08,923 --> 00:28:13,928
他们最终只会听到我们的笑声
When we are finished the only sound they will hear is our laughter.

296
00:28:14,095 --> 00:28:20,560
然后我们驶到哈瓦那迎接阳光和友谊
while we sail to Havana where the sun is warm and so is the comradeship.

297
00:28:21,852 --> 00:28:24,035
冷却系统已经启动
Cryogenic plant coming on line, Captain.

298
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:28,401
同志们  今天是大日子  我们缔造历史
A great day, comrades. We sail into history.

299
00:28:35,157 --> 00:28:38,619
启动履带式推进器
Caterpillar engaging.

300
00:28:39,704 --> 00:28:42,164
履带式推进器已启动  舰长
Caterpillar engaging, Captain.

301
00:28:56,762 --> 00:28:59,307
-发生了什么事?  -不知道
-What happened?  -I don't know.

302
00:29:26,208 --> 00:29:28,711
左满舵
Full rudder left.

303
00:29:28,878 --> 00:29:32,924
领航员  新航向: 250度
Navigator, new course: 250.

304
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:36,302
好的  新航向: 250
Yes. New course: 250.

305
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:13,130
声纳发现目标  左舷不远处
Sonar contact, Captain. Port quarter. Close aboard.

306
00:30:13,297 --> 00:30:17,510
-美国洛杉矶级潜艇  -美国潜艇! 舰长  我们...
-American, Los Angeles class.  -American! Captain, we...

307
00:30:17,677 --> 00:30:20,972
航向: 310
Course: 310.

308
00:30:21,138 --> 00:30:24,850
美军在跟踪我们?
Is the American turning to follow us?

309
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:28,563
不是  他们保持原来的航向
No, Captain. The American is continuing in his original course.

310
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:32,984
-他们继续驶向西北方  -他们听不多我们
-He is continuing north-west.  -He can't hear us.

311
00:30:33,150 --> 00:30:36,487
会不会听见歌声?
And the singing?

312
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,295
让他们唱吧
Let them sing.

313
00:31:10,062 --> 00:31:12,043
你说什么? 检查仪器
What are you talking about? Check your gear.

314
00:31:12,043 --> 00:31:14,025
正在运行诊断程序  舰长
Running diagnostics now, Captain.

315
00:31:20,448 --> 00:31:23,993
声纳工作正常  苏联人消失了
The sonar is working, Captain. The Russian disappeared.

316
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:28,581
听到1分钟  位于坚守4000码外  然后就消失了
One minute he was steady, 4,000 yards off the bow then he was gone.

317
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:34,754
-我好像听到...  -听到什么?
-And for a second, I thought I heard...  -Heard what?

318
00:31:34,921 --> 00:31:39,258
我好像听到歌声
I thought I heard singing, sir.

319
00:31:39,425 --> 00:31:43,137
-歌声?  -是的
-Singing?  -Yes, sir.

320
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:49,137
莫斯科  红旗舰队指挥部

321
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:57,693
早上好  长官
Good morning, sir.

322
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:01,739
早上好  长官
Good morning, sir.

323
00:32:03,616 --> 00:32:06,410
早上好  长官
Good morning, sir.

324
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:14,502
早上好  长官  昨晚睡得好吗
Good morning, sir. I hope you had a lovely evening.

325
00:32:14,669 --> 00:32:18,047
今早有点冷
A little chilly this morning.

326
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:45,575
马尔科・雷米斯寄了封信来
There's a letter from Marko Ramius.

327
00:32:45,741 --> 00:32:48,119
马尔科!
Ah, Marko!

328
00:33:19,358 --> 00:33:21,444
喂
Yes?

329
00:33:21,611 --> 00:33:25,281
我是瑞恩博士
No, this is Dr Ryan.

330
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:31,495
-发生什么事了?  -不再是学术研究那么简单
-What the hell happened?  -This is no longer research project.

331
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,274
我找到了那些门的资料
I got a line on those doors.

332
00:33:39,274 --> 00:33:42,048
你知道它们是什么吗?
You know what they are?

333
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:50,264
-无声推进系统  -你怎么知道的?
-A nearly silent propulsion system.  -How did you know that?

334
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:52,910
我们的潜艇曾经发现它
The captain of the sub following her radioed in.

335
00:33:52,910 --> 00:33:55,519
但它消失了
Thing disappeared right in front of him.

336
00:33:55,686 --> 00:33:58,439
这还不止  看看吧
And that's only the half of it. Read.

337
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:11,786
-有证件吗?  -真是难以置信
-Got your ID?  -My god, this is unbelievable.

338
00:34:11,953 --> 00:34:16,540
基洛夫级  斯维尔德洛夫级  基辅级  明斯克级
The Kirov, three Sverdlovs, the Kiev, the Minsk.

339
00:34:16,707 --> 00:34:18,229
他们出动了整支舰队
They've sortied their whole bloody fleet.

340
00:34:18,229 --> 00:34:19,752
看来是这样的
That's about the size of it.

341
00:34:22,546 --> 00:34:27,218
-我们去哪里?  -向杰弗里汇报情况
-Where are we going anyway?  -Briefing for Jeffrey Pelt.

342
00:34:27,385 --> 00:34:30,638
他是国防顾问
The President's Security Advisor.

343
00:34:30,638 --> 00:34:33,891
大部分参谋长都来了
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there, along with a few other people.

344
00:34:34,058 --> 00:34:38,312
-谁作汇报?  -你
-Who is giving the briefing?  -You are.

345
00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:41,106
文员已经给你准备好了幻灯片
The yeoman will have all the slides laid out for you.

346
00:34:41,106 --> 00:34:43,734
你只需...
So all you've got to do...

347
00:34:48,781 --> 00:34:53,284
没有人比你更了解这件事
Look, no one understands this material better than you.

348
00:34:54,412 --> 00:34:58,374
结合现有的资料  向他介绍这艘潜艇
Just give him a rundown on the sub and a precis of the stuff in your hand.

349
00:34:58,541 --> 00:35:02,962
他会单刀直入地发问  你实话实说
He's liable to ask some direct questions. Give him direct answers.

350
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:07,049
谈谈你的想法
Tell him what you think. Come on.

351
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:16,162
先生们  在过去二十四小时
Uh, gentlmen. The last 24 hours...

352
00:35:16,162 --> 00:35:19,645
苏联海军有不寻常的举动
have seen some extraordinary Soviet naval activity.

353
00:35:19,812 --> 00:35:23,691
这艘初次启航的潜艇被命名为"红十月号"
The first to sail was this ship we believe called the Red October...

354
00:35:23,858 --> 00:35:27,445
为了纪念1917年十月革命
in reference to the October revolution of 1917.

355
00:35:27,612 --> 00:35:31,240
它是台风级潜艇的变体  有650英尺长
A variant of the Typhoon class, she's 650 feet long

356
00:35:31,407 --> 00:35:34,034
排水量是三万二千吨
and 32,000 tons submerged displacement.

357
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:36,662
跟二次大战的航空母舰相等
Roughly the same size as a World War II aircraft carrier.

358
00:35:37,056 --> 00:35:41,087
舰首和舰尾的这些门后面...
We believe that these doors here on the bow...

359
00:35:41,056 --> 00:35:45,087
...是独特的推进系统
...and again on the stern enclose a unique propulsion system.

360
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:48,758
磁性压水式推进器  又名履带式推进器
A magneto-hydrodynamic drive, or caterpillar...

361
00:35:48,925 --> 00:35:52,803
所以潜艇可以无声无息地航行
that would enable the sub to run virtually silent.

362
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:55,785
舰长是最受敬重的
It is possible that this new drive system allowed the captain...

363
00:35:55,785 --> 00:35:58,601
资深指挥官  他叫雷米斯...
a man named Ramius, their senior and perhaps most respected commander.

364
00:35:58,768 --> 00:36:01,771
有没有他的照片?
Do we have his picture available?

365
00:36:01,938 --> 00:36:04,795
它可以避开战舰的追踪
Allowed Ramius to elude one of our attack boats...

366
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,652
达拉斯号今早尝试跟踪红十月号
the Dallas, which trailed Red October from harbor this morning.

367
00:36:09,904 --> 00:36:14,325
如果这推进器真的能无声运作
It is also possible that this drive system, if operable could render...

368
00:36:14,492 --> 00:36:19,538
红十月号就可以无视大西洋的警戒网
the Red October undetectable to our Sosus warning nets in the Atlantic.

369
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:24,919
这潜艇会不会是"先发制人武器"
Mr.Ryan. Would you characterize this as a first-strike weapon?

370
00:36:27,463 --> 00:36:30,299
有这个可能
Uh, that is a possibility, sir.

371
00:36:30,466 --> 00:36:34,914
它可以偷偷地接近对手
It is designed to approach by stealth and to shower its target with multiple...

372
00:36:34,914 --> 00:36:37,139
发射核弹头
independent warheads with little or no warning before impact.

373
00:36:38,307 --> 00:36:40,976
它是用来开战的
Goddamn thing was made to start a war.

374
00:36:40,976 --> 00:36:43,646
说下去  瑞恩先生
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

375
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:45,710
红十月号突然失踪
About the same time the Dallas lost contact...

376
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,608
与此同时
there were additional sailings.

377
00:36:47,775 --> 00:36:53,489
波利尼湾列宁格勒和地中海出动舰只
From Polijarny and from Leningrad on the Baltic and from the Mediterranean.

378
00:36:53,656 --> 00:36:58,786
58艘核潜艇正驶向大西洋
There are now some 58 nuclear submarines headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

379
00:36:58,953 --> 00:37:01,476
今天下午
This afternoon's satellite pass over...

380
00:37:01,476 --> 00:37:04,000
卫星发现波利尼湾的战舰发出热能
Polijarny found heat blooms in the engineering plants...

381
00:37:04,166 --> 00:37:06,773
表明  基洛夫级  明斯克级
at the Kirov, the Minsk and...

382
00:37:06,773 --> 00:37:09,380
和其它20艘巡洋舰和驱逐舰即将出海
more than 20 other cruisers and destroyers, indicating they were preparing to sail.

383
00:37:09,547 --> 00:37:12,049
苏联海面舰队大举出动
This constitutes the bulk of the Soviet surface fleet.

384
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:14,552
格里尔上将  你有什么结论
Admiral Greer, your conclusions.

385
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:19,056
现在没有足够的资料来作出结论
Well, sir, the data support no conclusions as yet.

386
00:37:19,223 --> 00:37:21,193
太平洋没有军舰
The absence of activity in the Pacific...

387
00:37:21,193 --> 00:37:23,164
他们可能只是演习
suggests this could be just an exercise.

388
00:37:23,164 --> 00:37:27,106
可能不是演习
Suppose it's not an exercise?

389
00:37:27,273 --> 00:37:31,319
他们可能想挑战北约
Suppose this is the beginning of a move against NATO?

390
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:36,211
我还有些非常敏感的信息
NSA can speak for that, Mr. Pelt. I must emphasize the extreme sensitivity...

391
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,576
绝对不能公开
of this information and that it not leave the room.

392
00:37:38,743 --> 00:37:40,974
在启航前
Before sailing...

393
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:43,205
雷米斯去信给巴度宁上将
Captain Ramius sent a letter to Admiral Yuri Padorin.

394
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:46,959
他是红旗舰队指挥部的主席
Chairman of the Red Fleet northern political directorate.

395
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:49,336
她的叔叔
That's her uncle.

396
00:37:49,336 --> 00:37:51,547
-谁的叔叔?  -雷米斯妻子的叔叔
-Whose uncle?  -Ramius' wife.

397
00:37:51,714 --> 00:37:54,884
巴度宁是她叔叔
Padorin is her uncle.

398
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:57,400
信的内容还不清楚
Now, the contents of the letter are unknown

399
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,099
但是巴度宁立刻和查宁戈总理开会
but Admiral Padorin immediately demanded a meeting with Premier Chernenko...

400
00:38:02,266 --> 00:38:08,397
数分钟后  苏联海军开始追寻红十月号
and within minutes of that meeting the Soviet fleet sailed with orders to...

401
00:38:08,564 --> 00:38:11,192
目的是击沉它
find Red October and sink her.

402
00:38:12,235 --> 00:38:16,614
-击沉它?  -他们要对付的是一个疯子
-Sink her?  -My God. They've got a madman on their hands.

403
00:38:16,781 --> 00:38:21,911
如果它驶入海岸范围五百英里  我们只有两分钟时间作准备
Within 500 miles off the coast, we'll have only two minutes' warning.

404
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:38,719
-今天是23号  是吧?  -什么?
-Today's the 23rd, isn't it?  -What?

405
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:41,138
-今天是23号吗?  -是的
-Is today the 23rd?  -Yeah.

406
00:38:51,983 --> 00:38:55,486
你个XX的!
You son of a bitch.

407
00:38:55,653 --> 00:38:59,240
你个XX的!
You son of a bitch!

408
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,289
你有什么高见  瑞恩博士?
You wish to add something to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

409
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:16,674
我们可以考虑另一种可能性
I was just thinking that perhaps there's another possibility we might consider.

410
00:39:16,841 --> 00:39:20,469
雷米斯可能想叛变
Ramius might be trying to defect.

411
00:39:20,636 --> 00:39:24,098
-那么你的建议是?  -说下去
-Do you mean to suggest that this man has come...  -Proceed. Mr. Ryan.

412
00:39:27,268 --> 00:39:32,273
雷米斯负责训练军官
Look. Ramius trained most of their officer corps...

413
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,903
他可以挑选忠于自己的下属
which would put him in a position to select men willing to help him.

414
00:39:37,069 --> 00:39:40,489
他不是俄国人  他生于立陶宛
He's not Russian. He's Lithuanian by birth...

415
00:39:40,656 --> 00:39:44,493
由当渔夫的祖父带大
raised by his paternal grandfather, a fisherman.

416
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:49,206
他没有孩子  没有家累
And he has no children. No ties to leave behind.

417
00:39:50,791 --> 00:39:55,379
今天是他妻子首个忌日
And today is the first anniversary of his wife's death.

418
00:39:55,546 --> 00:39:58,611
别瞎猜  你只是个分析员  你怎么知道?
Oh. Come on. You're just an analyst. How can you read his mind?

419
00:39:58,611 --> 00:40:01,677
我认识雷米斯
I know Ramius, General.

420
00:40:01,844 --> 00:40:04,179
他是潜艇舰队的传奇人物
He's nearly a legend in the submarine community.

421
00:40:04,179 --> 00:40:06,515
他敢于挑战政党
He's been a maverick his entire career.

422
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:09,018
我在外交宴会见过他
I actually met him once at an embassy dinner.

423
00:40:09,018 --> 00:40:11,354
将军  你认识雷米斯吗?
Have you ever met Captain Ramius, General?

424
00:40:20,321 --> 00:40:22,453
霍利斯上将
Admiral Hollis

425
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:27,453
雷米斯何时到达导弹发射地点?
how long before Ramius could be in a position to fire his missiles at us?

426
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:32,500
-四天后  -好的  我会向总统汇报
-Four days.  -All right, I'll brief the President.

427
00:40:33,626 --> 00:40:38,422
瑞恩博士  请留步
Dr Ryan, would you stay for a moment, please?

428
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:42,802
我叫你实话实说  但这次...
I said speak your mind, Jack, but Jesus...

429
00:40:54,564 --> 00:40:57,858
你令将军难以下台
You slammed the door on the general pretty hard, Jack.

430
00:40:58,025 --> 00:41:01,571
-我无意冒犯他  -这我知道
-That was not my intention, sir.  -Oh, yes, it was.

431
00:41:01,737 --> 00:41:04,552
他当众奚落你  然后你回击他
He was patronizing you, and you stomped on him.

432
00:41:04,552 --> 00:41:07,368
我认为他应有此报
In my opinion, he deserved it.

433
00:41:07,535 --> 00:41:12,623
我是政客  政客会说谎使诈
Listen, I'm a politician, which means I'm a cheat and a liar...

434
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:16,335
这一刻在吻婴孩  转过脸就抢棒棒糖
and when I'm not kissing babies, I'm stealing their lollipops.

435
00:41:16,502 --> 00:41:21,507
但政客会灵活地听取意见
But it also means that I keep my options open.

436
00:41:21,674 --> 00:41:27,263
现在假设你说得对
So let's assume for a minute that you're right...

437
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:34,020
这个苏联人想叛变  我们该做什么?
and this Russian intends to defect. What do you suggest we do about it?

438
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:40,026
-我们夺取潜艇  -等等
-We definitely grab the boat, sir.  -Hey, wait a minute.

439
00:41:40,192 --> 00:41:43,446
这不是一个迷途的米格战机飞行员
We're not talking about some stray pilot with a M.I.G.

440
00:41:43,613 --> 00:41:48,576
我们谈论的是价值数十亿美元的苏联国家财产
We're talking about several billion dollars worth of Soviet state property.

441
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:51,224
苏联肯定会追回的
They're going to want it back.

442
00:41:51,224 --> 00:41:53,706
派人登上潜艇调查他们
Maybe it's enough then just to get some people on board and inspect it.

443
00:41:53,873 --> 00:41:57,960
编个借口... 进行"海岸例行检查"
Call it whatever you want to... a Coastguard safety inspection.

444
00:41:58,127 --> 00:42:01,505
从何着手?
So how do we proceed?

445
00:42:01,672 --> 00:42:05,468
通知大西洋舰队的指挥官
First, we need to contact the commanders in the Atlantic directly.

446
00:42:05,635 --> 00:42:07,929
如果苏军窥听到我们的命令
The Russians get one whiff of this through...

447
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:10,223
这游戏就结束了
the regular communications circuits, the game is up.

448
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:13,434
我们要制定策略帮助他们
Secondly, we figure out how we can help them.

449
00:42:13,601 --> 00:42:18,231
准备随时介入  调停这场风波
We need to devise a plan to intercede, ready to go at a moment's notice.

450
00:42:18,397 --> 00:42:21,087
最后  派人接触雷米斯
The third, somebody's got to go make contact with Ramius...

451
00:42:21,087 --> 00:42:23,778
找出他的动机
and find out what his intentions really are.

452
00:42:23,945 --> 00:42:27,031
好  你何时出发?
Okay, when do you leave?

453
00:42:28,783 --> 00:42:32,119
等等
Wait a minute!

454
00:42:32,286 --> 00:42:36,374
将军说得对  我只是局外人  我是个分析员而已
The general was right. I am not field personnel. I am only an analyst.

455
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:39,669
你是最佳人选  我不能差遣他们
You're perfect. I can't ask any of these characters to go.

456
00:42:39,835 --> 00:42:43,422
第一  他们不会相信  他们不会凭直觉行事
One, they don't believe them. Two, they wouldn't stake their reputations on a hunch...

457
00:42:43,589 --> 00:42:46,968
-而你...  -可以被牺牲
-where as you...  -Are expendable.

458
00:42:48,844 --> 00:42:52,014
差不多
Something like that.

459
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:57,728
在三天之内证实你的理论
I'll give you three days to prove your theory correct.

460
00:42:57,895 --> 00:43:04,485
否则我们要消灭雷米斯  明白吗
After that, I have to hunt down Ramius and destroy him. Will you do it?

461
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:14,885
坐标54-90  苏联雅夫级潜艇  卡华洛夫号  舰长图波列夫

462
00:43:21,294 --> 00:43:23,421
岂有此理
Mother of God!

463
00:43:23,588 --> 00:43:27,841
双引擎三分之二全速前进
Secure the masts. All ahead two thirds. Set depth to 900 meters.

464
00:43:27,841 --> 00:43:32,094
-发生什么事了?  -关闭舱盖  三分之二速度下潜
-What is it? What's happened?  -Mast secured, helm at 2/3.

465
00:43:33,639 --> 00:43:37,393
左转至方位205
Come left, heading 205.

466
00:43:51,532 --> 00:43:54,910
命令是七小时前发布的  呆在底下
These orders are seven bloody hours old! Sitting on the bottom.

467
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,289
像个头脑混乱的小孩
Like an addled schoolboy.

468
00:43:58,456 --> 00:44:02,084
-舰长  -超速前进
-Captain?  -All ahead flank.

469
00:44:02,251 --> 00:44:07,423
问下工程师反应堆能否推动至105%
Inquire of the engineer about going to 105% on the reactor.

470
00:44:07,590 --> 00:44:13,512
七小时了  整支舰队在追捕他
Seven hours! The entire fleet is after him.

471
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:23,981
到达900米深
Leveling at 900 meters.

472
00:44:24,148 --> 00:44:30,780
舰长  工程师说反应堆可推动至105%  但不建议这样
Captain, Engineer reports 105% on the reactor is possible... but not recommended.

473
00:44:41,374 --> 00:44:44,502
推动至百分之一百零五
Go to 105 on the reactor.

474
00:44:46,837 --> 00:44:52,927
-什么事? 我们去哪里?  -去杀一个朋友
-Captain, what is it? Where are we going?  -We're going to kill a friend.

475
00:44:53,803 --> 00:44:57,390
我们去杀雷米斯
We're going to kill Ramius.

476
00:45:17,451 --> 00:45:22,039
从没在舰上喝过这么难喝的罗宋汤
If you like borscht, perhaps, but I've eaten better in an oiler's galley.

477
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:27,503
我太太对待应说  这厨子在阿富汗学烹饪?
My wife asked the waiter, "Where did this man learn to cook, Afghanistan?"

478
00:45:27,670 --> 00:45:32,091
然后我们去看芭蕾舞  去看那位像吉赛尔的新舞者
So then we went on to the Bolshoi, the ballet, to see this new girl as Giselle.

479
00:45:32,258 --> 00:45:36,762
那位新舞蹈员真是漂亮  她嫁给工厂经理...
You remember how beautiful she was. She just married a factory manager.

480
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:43,519
医生  有没有最新的辐射测验数据
Excuse me, Doctor. Do you have the figures for the latest batch of radiation tests?

481
00:45:43,686 --> 00:45:46,063
现在要?
Now?

482
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:49,400
是的
Now.

483
00:45:49,567 --> 00:45:55,364
上一次测验的数据也拿来吧  作个对比
Perhaps you could bring the preceding set as well... for comparison.

484
00:45:55,531 --> 00:45:58,409
谢谢你  医生
Thank you, Doctor.

485
00:46:15,092 --> 00:46:18,387
他不会这么快回来
It will take him some time.

486
00:46:19,597 --> 00:46:24,477
在开始前  我想了解普金的死因
Before we begin, Captain. I'd like to know exactly what happened to Putin.

487
00:46:30,358 --> 00:46:36,656
-他不是真的滑倒吧  -我不喜欢你这样的语气
-He didn't slip on his tea, did he?  -I don't think I like your tone, Slavin.

488
00:46:36,822 --> 00:46:39,227
我们在这儿
What the hell's my tone got to do with it?

489
00:46:39,227 --> 00:46:41,632
身处险境
We're risking our lives here.

490
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,038
普金会带来麻烦
Putin could have made complications.

491
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:48,251
你以为他会袖手旁观  成全我们?
Did you think he would go away and sulk while we carried out our plans?

492
00:46:48,417 --> 00:46:51,712
他被谋杀?
Are you saying he was murdered?

493
00:46:51,712 --> 00:46:55,007
-老天  -别发牢骚
-My God.  -Stop whining, Yuri.

494
00:46:55,174 --> 00:46:59,053
他就是被谋杀的  他是个混蛋
So he was murdered. I have no problem with that. The man was a pig.

495
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:03,391
-但我们应该一起做决定  -你不是指挥官
-But it is a decision we should have all made together.  -You are not in command here.

496
00:47:03,558 --> 00:47:08,604
如果真相败露  船员会叛变
If the crew finds out, we could have a mutiny.

497
00:47:08,771 --> 00:47:11,774
艇上每一件事都会影响我们
Everything that happens on this ship affects us all.

498
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:14,777
纠察长已经起了疑心
The Master-At-Arms is already suspicious.

499
00:47:14,944 --> 00:47:20,575
-现在还可以回去...  -绝不能回头
-We could still go back.  -There'll be no going back.

500
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:26,581
启航前  我给巴度宁上将寄了封信
Before we sailed, I dispatched a letter to Admiral Padorin...

501
00:47:26,747 --> 00:47:31,127
我在信内宣布了叛变计划
in which I announced our intention to defect.

502
00:47:32,878 --> 00:47:36,299
我的天  为什么?
In the name of God, why?

503
00:47:36,465 --> 00:47:41,137
到达新世界后  科特兹烧掉所有船
When he reached the new world, Cortez burned his ships.

504
00:47:41,304 --> 00:47:46,809
-手下只好跟他一起奋斗  -你把我们置之死地
-As a result, his men were well motivated.  -You have signed our death warrants.

505
00:47:46,976 --> 00:47:52,648
-巴多宁上将会派整支舰队来  -他们会追捕我们
-Padorin will send the entire fleet.  -Jesus! They'll find us.

506
00:47:52,815 --> 00:47:57,486
没有人会来找我们  住口吧
Nobody is going to find us. That's enough, Yuri.

507
00:47:57,653 --> 00:48:03,159
把潜艇交给美国是不够的
You had to do it, huh? You couldn't just turn the submarine over to the Americans.

508
00:48:03,326 --> 00:48:07,079
你还要发表政治宣言
You had to make a political statement.

509
00:48:07,246 --> 00:48:13,961
背后隐藏着什么心态? 为何不能静静地溜走?
Or was it something deeper, Captain? Something that made you unable to slip away?

510
00:48:14,128 --> 00:48:20,635
-是虚荣心作崇吧?  -我们为着不同的原因叛变  维克多
-Was it ego, Captain?  -We each have our reasons, Victor.

511
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:25,431
收到这潜艇的蓝图后  我开始思变
My own began the day I was handed the blueprints for this ship.

512
00:48:25,598 --> 00:48:30,228
这潜艇本来只有一个用途  我改变它的用途...
A ship which had but one use. And as for the rest...

513
00:48:30,394 --> 00:48:34,941
我会负上全责
well, those are things that I alone must carry the burden for.

514
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:41,739
安纳托利  你害怕我们的舰队  你应该害怕
Anatoly, you're afraid of our fleet. Well, you should be.

515
00:48:41,906 --> 00:48:47,078
我相信  我们有三分一的胜算
Personally, I give us... one chance in three.

516
00:48:50,414 --> 00:48:54,418
要茶吗?
More tea, anyone?

517
00:48:55,670 --> 00:48:58,506
不要了?
No?

518
00:48:58,673 --> 00:49:02,009
你们可以回岗位了
Then you may report back to your posts.

519
00:49:18,234 --> 00:49:21,821
听到舰长的命令吧  散会
You heard the captain, dismissed.

520
00:49:29,662 --> 00:49:31,747
舰长
Captain.

521
00:49:43,801 --> 00:49:49,473
我不会在他们面前反驳你
Captain, I would never disagree with you in front of the men, you know that.

522
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,352
但这次维克多说得对
But in this case Victor was right.

523
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:58,482
-不通知莫斯科会比较好  -瓦西里
-It would have been better if you had not informed to Moscow.  -Oh, Vasily.

524
00:49:58,649 --> 00:50:04,238
莫斯科不足为患  苏联海军也不难对付
Moscow is not the worry, nor the whole Soviet Navy.

525
00:50:04,405 --> 00:50:10,036
我了解他们的战略  我有优势
I know their tactics. I have the advantage.

526
00:50:12,747 --> 00:50:16,626
美国人才叫人担心
The worry is the Americans.

527
00:50:16,792 --> 00:50:22,089
遇上适当的对手才会成功
If we meet the right sort, this will work.

528
00:50:24,175 --> 00:50:28,804
如果对方性急鲁莽...
We get some buckaroo...

529
00:50:32,767 --> 00:50:37,563
有乱流  你不喜欢坐飞机?
Some turbulence. You don't like flying?

530
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:41,943
这不算是什么  5个月前的乱流那才厉害
This is nothing. You should have been here five months ago.

531
00:50:42,109 --> 00:50:46,822
呕吐更是不在话下  我们在日本海遇上雹暴
Talk about puke! We ran into a hail storm over the Sea of Japan, Right?

532
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:51,535
机师吐在挡风玻璃上
The pilot shot his lunch all over the windshield...

533
00:50:51,702 --> 00:50:54,372
我往无线电吐
and I barfed on the radio.

534
00:50:54,538 --> 00:50:57,520
一切倾囊而出
Knocked it out completely, and it wasn't that...

535
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,503
那是次重量级呕吐
lightweight stuff either! It was that chunky, industrial-weight puke!

536
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:04,090
要不要吃一点?
You want a bite?

537
00:51:04,257 --> 00:51:07,593
下次我会把你的高见记在备忘录中
Next time you get a bright idea, just put it in a memo.

538
00:51:10,593 --> 00:51:14,893
美国企业号  北大西洋舰队  新斯科舍以东

539
00:51:16,936 --> 00:51:21,607
-长官  -你可以走了  中尉
-Sir.  -That will be all, Lieutenant. Thank you.

540
00:51:21,774 --> 00:51:26,737
-鹰眼那班机怎么样了?  -遇上了强风
-That hawkeye from Weymouth Trap?  -Four wire. Caught a gust over the fantail.

541
00:51:26,904 --> 00:51:31,117
-那还不算太差  -这位先生想见你
-Not bad considering.  -The gentleman is here to see you.

542
00:51:31,284 --> 00:51:34,370
查理  你说什么?
The gentleman? What the hell are you talking about, Charlie?

543
00:51:34,537 --> 00:51:39,417
司令说  穿军服才不会惹人注意
I apologize for the uniform, sir. This is Admiral Greer's idea of a low profile.

544
00:51:39,584 --> 00:51:42,816
-你是司令的下属?  -是的  长官
-You work for Jim Greer?  -That's all right, sir.

545
00:51:42,816 --> 00:51:46,048
告诉我  到底发生了什么事
Then I imagine you'll tell me what all the hubbub's about.

546
00:51:48,926 --> 00:51:53,848
舰长  你有时间吗?  有个东西你应该去看看
Captain, you got a minute? Jonesy's got something I think you ought to see.

547
00:51:55,141 --> 00:52:00,396
-你去喝点咖啡  叫他们给我送茶来  -好的  舰长
-Martinez, get yourself a cup of coffee. Send me up some tea.  -Aye, Captain.

548
00:52:00,563 --> 00:52:03,858
舰长要一杯茶
Messenger, get the captain a cup of tea.

549
00:52:05,610 --> 00:52:13,200
台风七号消失后  我听到歌声...
Captain. Sir, the moment that sub went silent and I thought I heard singing...

550
00:52:13,367 --> 00:52:16,745
我听到很微弱的背景声
I heard something in the background, real faint.

551
00:52:16,745 --> 00:52:20,124
等其它潜艇离开后  我录下这些声音
After all those subs took off, I caught it again and got it on tape.

552
00:52:20,291 --> 00:52:25,254
用电脑过滤声带  剩下这声音
I washed it through the computer and was able to isolate this sound.

553
00:52:28,382 --> 00:52:33,429
电脑认为  这是"岩浆移位"的声音
The computer identified it as magma displacement.

554
00:52:33,596 --> 00:52:38,643
这套软件本来是用来探测地震的
The SAPS software was originally written to look for seismic events.

555
00:52:38,809 --> 00:52:42,647
所以  它用地震来解释陌生的音调
When it gets confused, it runs home to momma.

556
00:52:42,813 --> 00:52:45,816
-我不知道你想说什么  -对不起
-I'm not following you.  -Sir, I'm sorry.

557
00:52:45,983 --> 00:52:48,986
以十倍速度再听听
Listen to it at ten times speed.

558
00:52:56,577 --> 00:53:00,706
-这一定是人为的声音  -对
-Now, that's got to be manmade, Captain.  -All right.

559
00:53:03,084 --> 00:53:07,421
首次发现目标是9时15分  方位269
The first contact was at 09:15 and the bearing was 269.

560
00:53:07,588 --> 00:53:10,257
9时30分的时候  它在这里
At 09:30, it was here.

561
00:53:10,257 --> 00:53:12,927
在11时和11时15分又在这两点发现它
I came back to it at 11:00 and 11:15, here and here.

562
00:53:13,094 --> 00:53:15,951
苏联潜艇可以高速驶过
Remember the dispatch we got about Russian sub skippers running...

563
00:53:15,951 --> 00:53:18,808
雷克雅内斯海脊
the Reykjanes Ridge at high speeds...

564
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,705
因为他们掌握了海底悬崖的地势
because they had hyper-accurate surveys of the underwater canyons...

565
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:22,436
他们有"红航线一号"
Yeah, Red Route One.

566
00:53:22,603 --> 00:53:27,441
-海底悬崖的入口是托尔双峰  -是的
-The front door to those canyons was a formation called Thor's Twins, Right?

567
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:29,944
看看这个
Look at that.

568
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:47,587
-直驱"红航线一号"  -舰长
-Right into Red Route One.  -Captain.

569
00:53:47,753 --> 00:53:51,465
我可能疯了  但我打赌
You may think I'm crazy, but I'll bet that...

570
00:53:51,465 --> 00:53:55,177
这是艘新型苏联潜艇
magma displacement was actually some new Russian sub...

571
00:53:55,344 --> 00:53:59,432
它驶向冰岛海岸
and it's headed for the Iceland coast.

572
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:02,873
恕我直言  钟斯
Have I got this straight, Jonesy?

573
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:06,147
你不信任价值四千万的电脑说是地震
A $40 million computer tells you you're chasing an earthquake...

574
00:54:06,314 --> 00:54:11,652
你要另找答案
but you don't believe it. And you come up with this on your own.

575
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:17,825
-是的  -别紧张  我相信你
-Yes, sir.  -Relax, you've sold me.

576
00:54:17,992 --> 00:54:25,708
汤米  计划航线  赶去"红航线一号"
Tommy, I want you to plot us a speed course for the bottom end of Red Route One.

577
00:54:25,875 --> 00:54:28,627
进了海底峡谷就无法找到他们
We'll never find him in those canyons.

578
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:31,380
我们先移动到潜望镜深度  但最好先通知总部
First take us to periscope depth. But first we'd better phone in.

579
00:54:31,547 --> 00:54:34,675
遵命  舰长
Aye, aye, Captain.

580
00:54:42,433 --> 00:54:44,602
等等  钟斯
Hang on, Jonesy.

581
00:54:48,981 --> 00:54:53,069
如果我们能靠近它  你可以追踪它吗?
If I can get you close enough, can you track this sucker?

582
00:54:53,236 --> 00:54:59,450
是的  我听过它的声音  它逃不掉的
Yes, sir. Now that I know what to listen for... I'll bag him.

583
00:55:00,826 --> 00:55:04,413
-继续工作  -遵命  长官
-Carry on.  -Yes, sir.

584
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:07,896
真是荒天下之大谬
That's the craziest notion I've ever heard...

585
00:55:07,896 --> 00:55:11,212
整艘潜艇全体成员都想叛变?
a serving line officer? An entire ballistic missile submarine?

586
00:55:11,379 --> 00:55:15,716
就算只是军官叛变  我也不相信
They can't all want to defect, even if it's only the officers.

587
00:55:15,883 --> 00:55:19,428
-他有什么计划?  -计划?
-What's his plan?  -His plan?

588
00:55:19,595 --> 00:55:23,057
苏联人连上厕所也会预先计划
Russians don't take a dump without a plan.

589
00:55:23,224 --> 00:55:25,559
高级军官
Senior captains don't start...

590
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,895
不会贸然冒险
something this dangerous without having thought the matter through.

591
00:55:28,062 --> 00:55:30,400
-他将要做什么  直接驶往纽约?
-What's he going to do, he's just going to sail into New York?

592
00:55:30,462 --> 00:55:32,400
-可能就这么简单
-It might be that simple.

593
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:35,444
在中情局纸上谈兵当然简单
Things may appear simple in the cubicle at CIA.

594
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:40,825
在北大西洋面对整队苏联战舰  那就复杂了
But in the middle of the North Atlantic they get a bit more complex.

595
00:55:40,992 --> 00:55:44,620
-抽烟吗?  -不  谢谢
-Smoke?  -No, thank you.

596
00:55:44,787 --> 00:55:49,125
"海岸例行检查"是行不通的
And I don't think your notion of a few days inspection's going to wash either.

597
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:51,502
我们必须要彻底研究整艘潜艇
In order to be any value, you'd have to tear it apart.

598
00:55:51,502 --> 00:55:53,713
这可能需要几个月
The metallurgy would take a couple of months.

599
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:59,176
-那我们就扣押潜艇  -船员怎么处置？
-Then we have to keep it.  -What will you do with the crew?

600
00:55:59,343 --> 00:56:03,097
不愿叛变的人会回去告发我们
Ones that don't defect will go back and say we got the boat.

601
00:56:03,264 --> 00:56:09,312
-你打算杀了他们?  -我们不是在打仗
-Or do you plan to eliminate them?  -We're not at war, sir.

602
00:56:09,478 --> 00:56:13,192
我们要想办法不让他们知道
So you have to get them off the boat in such a way...

603
00:56:13,278 --> 00:56:15,192
我们得到了潜艇
that they think we don't have it.

604
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:19,196
不能让苏联知道我们得到了潜艇
They'll go back and report that we don't have it to their bosses.

605
00:56:19,363 --> 00:56:24,535
否则说什么也没用  对吗?
Otherwise, this whole business is just academic, right?

606
00:56:24,702 --> 00:56:26,954
是  长官  我明白你的意思
Yes, sir. I think I see your point.

607
00:56:29,749 --> 00:56:34,503
-你上次睡觉是什么时候?  -很久之前了
-When was the last time you slept?  -A while.

608
00:56:35,922 --> 00:56:40,051
-外面的长官会为你打点一切  -谢谢你  长官
-The chief outside will fix you up.  -Thank you, sir.

609
00:56:40,218 --> 00:56:42,637
舰长
Captain.

610
00:56:46,641 --> 00:56:50,144
天快亮了  我们在战斗情报中心
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours. We'll be in the CIC.

611
00:56:50,311 --> 00:56:55,483
-我们要面对种种危机  -是的
-Things are liable to get a little dicey around here.  -Yes, sir.

612
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:07,912
-你认为他疯了?  -疯得可以
-You think he's crazy?  -Certifiable.

613
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:12,291
我不想见到他穿军服
And I don't care for him wearing the uniform.

614
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:15,357
看到那戒指吗? 72年毕业  他是海军陆战队成员
Did you see that ring on his finger? The Academy class of '72. A Marine.

615
00:57:15,357 --> 00:57:18,256
不会吧...
You're kidding. How did you...

616
00:57:18,422 --> 00:57:25,304
格里尔告诉我  三年级时  他在直升机上遇上意外
Greer told me. Summer of his third year, he went down in a chopper accident.

617
00:57:25,471 --> 00:57:28,891
很惨  机师和队员都死了
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

618
00:57:28,891 --> 00:57:32,311
他花了十个月接受牵引治疗  花了一年学走路
That kid spent 10 months in traction and another year learning to walk again.

619
00:57:33,688 --> 00:57:37,525
第四年  是在医院念的
He did his fourth year from the hospital.

620
00:57:37,692 --> 00:57:43,155
你可以考虑给他一次机会
It's up to you, Charlie, but you might consider cutting him a little slack.

621
00:57:45,241 --> 00:57:49,829
反正苏联人会先找到那潜艇
The Russians will find that sub before we get near it anyway.

622
00:58:10,725 --> 00:58:15,104
-正在穿越托尔双峰  -很好
-Passing Thor's Twins, sir.  -Very good.

623
00:58:19,483 --> 00:58:23,779
-穿越托尔双峰  -很好  开始进入航道
-Passing the Twins now, Captain.  -Very good. Commence your run.

624
00:58:23,946 --> 00:58:27,158
-拐弯时通知我  -好的  舰长
-Call me when you get to the first turn.  -Aye, Captain.

625
00:58:27,325 --> 00:58:31,370
-卡马洛夫  开始进入航道  -遵命  长官
Mr. Kamarov, you may commence your run now.  -Aye, sir.

626
00:58:31,537 --> 00:58:37,877
开始第一阶段  航向: 260  速度: 18节
First leg on my mark. Course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

627
00:58:38,044 --> 00:58:40,796
深度: 270米
Depth: 270 meters.

628
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:46,177
五  四  三  二  一
Five, four, three, two, one...

629
00:58:46,344 --> 00:58:48,638
开始
Mark.

630
00:58:48,804 --> 00:58:54,602
下潜命令  航向: 260  速度: 18节
Diving Command, course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

631
00:58:54,769 --> 00:59:01,525
给我秒表和地图  我能驾驶没有窗的飞机
Give me a stopwatch and a map and I'll fly the Alps in a plane with no windows.

632
00:59:01,692 --> 00:59:05,112
如果地图够准确的话
If the map is accurate enough.

633
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:29,387
我们进了航道  接近首个弯口
We're in the lane and approaching the first turn.

634
00:59:29,554 --> 00:59:34,475
三十秒后左转到方位195
Come left to course 195 in 30 seconds.

635
00:59:34,642 --> 00:59:39,564
上升到200米  保持速度
Decrease depth to 200 meters. Maintain speed.

636
00:59:41,774 --> 00:59:45,861
舰长  我们正在接近首个弯口  25秒后转到方位195
Captain, we are approaching the first turn. 25 seconds to course 1-9-5.

637
00:59:46,028 --> 00:59:50,825
加速至26节  重新计算
Increase speed to 26 knots and recompute.

很好  保持航线和速度
Very good. Maintain course and speed.

647
01:00:48,007 --> 01:00:51,594
太快了  瓦西里
Too fast, Vassily. Too fast.

648
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:57,183
该用什么速度  图表写得很清楚
Those charts are laid out precisely. So many knots for so many seconds.

649
01:00:57,350 --> 01:01:02,480
-这艘船会捱不住的  -说话小心点  斯莱文先生
-This thing handles like a pig.  -Watch your bearing, Mr. Slavin.

650
01:01:08,444 --> 01:01:12,365
十五秒后转向  要减速吗?
15 seconds to turn, Captain. Should we decrease speed?

651
01:01:12,531 --> 01:01:16,619
不  准备右转

我们位置正确  下一阶段  34分钟后  抵达海王山丘
We're in the lane. Next leg 34 minutes to the Neptune Massif.

656
01:01:55,950 --> 01:01:58,953
航向: 240

657
01:02:11,132 --> 01:02:14,844
-发生什么事?  -冷却系统故障
-What happened?  -The cryogenic plant.

658
01:02:15,011 --> 01:02:20,141
磁石无法降温  履带温度高出了50度
The magnets aren't being cooled. We're 50 degrees above red line.

659
01:02:20,308 --> 01:02:25,146
-如果不关掉它  它会熔化  -关掉它吧
-It's going to melt.  -Kill it, shut it down!

660
01:02:28,816 --> 01:02:32,069
-舰长  -发生了什么事?

01:02:51,631 --> 01:02:55,551
舰长  我们必须停下来  修理履带系统
Captain, we will have to stop until we can repair the caterpillar unit.

666
01:02:55,718 --> 01:03:02,058
-那就用普通推进系统航行  -舰长  我们会发出声音
-Negative. We will run on normal propulsion.  -Captain, we will not be silent.

667
01:03:02,225 --> 01:03:08,022
时速改为20节  启动螺旋桨
Make revolutions for 20 knots and engage the propellers.

668
01:03:10,524 --> 01:03:16,822
-是  舰长  -他会把我们害死
-Aye, Captain.  -That man will get us all killed.

669
01:03:21,244 --> 01:03:24,580
舰长自有分寸
The captain knows what he's doing.

670
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:32,505
海军行动? 我不了解这些事
Naval activities? I have no knowledge of this.

671
01:03:32,672 --> 01:03:36,801
-我没当过海员  -大使先生
-But then, I never was a sailor.  -Mr. Ambassador...

672
01:03:36,968 --> 01:03:41,847
贵国在北大西洋  有一百艘军舰
You have nearly 100 naval vessels operating in the North Atlantic right now.

673
01:03:42,014 --> 01:03:45,184
贵国的战机  抛下无数声纳浮标
Your aircraft have dropped enough sonar buoys

674
01:03:45,351 --> 01:03:48,020
你可以踏着浮标  从格陵兰走到苏格兰
that a man could walk from Greenland to Scotland without getting his feet wet.

675
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,690
我们要试一下吗?
Shall we dispense with the bull?

676
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:55,987
你的表达总是很有技巧
You make your point as delicately as ever, Mr. Pelt. But...

677
01:03:56,153 --> 01:04:01,033
军事演习可能是战争的前奏
And what looks like an exercise could be a prelude to war.

678
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:03,723
你怎能分辨虚实?
How can we tell the difference?

679
01:04:03,723 --> 01:04:06,247
我们必须派船去监视你们
Prudence demands that we deploy ships to observe yours.

680
01:04:06,414 --> 01:04:09,417
你的政府可能会起了戒心...
Your government should consider that...

681
01:04:09,584 --> 01:04:15,381
双方的船舰和战机太过接近
that having your ships and ours in such proximity...

682
01:04:15,548 --> 01:04:21,637
本来就危险  战争就是这样
is inherently dangerous? Wars have begun that way, Mr. Ambassador.

683
01:04:31,147 --> 01:04:33,482
我们遗失了一艘潜艇
We have lost one of our submarines.

684
01:04:33,482 --> 01:04:35,818
-遗失?  -它可能沉没了...
-Lost it?  -We fear she may be down, and...

685
01:04:35,985 --> 01:04:39,071
说起来很尴尬
this is most embarrassing, but...

686
01:04:39,238 --> 01:04:45,786
船上的军官  都是高干子弟
Several of the crew, the officers, are sons of high Party officials.

687
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:51,709
其中一位甚至是中央委员的儿子
One is even the son of a Central Committee member. I can't say which.

688
01:04:53,002 --> 01:04:58,049
-你们正在进行拯救行动?  -是的
-You're telling me this is a massive rescue operation?  -That is correct.

689
01:05:01,135 --> 01:05:04,722
真遗憾  需要我们帮忙吗?
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

690
01:05:07,058 --> 01:05:11,646
-我觉得...  -进行联合援救?
-I'm not sure that...  -Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

691
01:05:14,982 --> 01:05:18,027
非常感谢
That is very gracious of you, sir.

692
01:05:18,194 --> 01:05:21,155
我会传达你的好意
I will pass your offer on.

693
01:05:21,322 --> 01:05:24,533
但这次  我们暂时不需要帮忙
But at this time, I think we're doing everything that can be done.

694
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:33,833

Captain.

696
01:05:48,849 --> 01:05:54,730
我们根据你的意思制定战略  舰队会找到我们
Our strategy depends on your answer. The entire fleet will know where we are.

697
01:05:54,897 --> 01:05:59,819
舰长  声纳在低空发现一架多引擎螺旋桨飞机
Captain, Sonar. We have just been overflown by a multi-engine turboprop.

战斗岗位!
Battle stations!

702
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:21,799
还有多久到达海王山丘?

01:06:21,966 --> 01:06:26,596
-多久?  -4分10秒

704
01:06:26,762 --> 01:06:30,808
-要下潜吗?  -太迟了
-Should we bottom the boat, Captain?  -No. Too late for that now.

705
01:06:30,975 --> 01:06:36,731
没时间了  计算参数  准备鱼雷散射
We're out of time. Counter measures. Prepare to launch a full spread.

我们没有空间进行机动
We have no room to maneuver in these canyons, Captain.

716
01:07:30,326 --> 01:07:32,787
闭嘴
Shut up!

717
01:07:36,707 --> 01:07:39,689
鱼雷接近反鱼雷  失去目标

01:10:08,067 --> 01:10:13,032
如果他们真的开火  我们早就死了
If they were really shooting at us, we'd be dead by now.

743
01:10:32,474 --> 01:10:36,770
我知道履带出了什么问题

744

缓冲器被破坏
The buffer circuit has been torn out.

745
01:10:40,148 --> 01:10:43,360
履带迟早会负荷过重
It was only a matter of time, before an overload shut it down.

746
01:10:43,527 --> 01:10:47,009
你说什么?

747
01:10:47,009 --> 01:10:50,492
有人知道如何弄坏履带而不被轻易发现
Whoever did this knew how to cripple the caterpillar in a way not easy to find.

748
01:10:50,659 --> 01:10:53,996
艇上有内奸
Captain, we have a saboteur on board.

749
01:10:58,083 --> 01:11:02,003
不会是军官  军官不会等到启航后才动手
It can't be any of the officers, They had plenty of time before we embarked.

750
01:11:02,003 --> 01:11:05,924
这一定是水兵干的
Must be a member on the crew.

751
01:11:06,091 --> 01:11:11,138
翻查普金的档案  调查海员身分
Go to Putin's cabin. Check his files for information on the crew.

752
01:11:11,305 --> 01:11:13,640
我们可能要提早遣散水兵
We may have to put them off before we planned.

01:11:25,569 --> 01:11:30,699
他已经有办法赶走船员了
We don't have to get the crew off the sub. He would have had to do that.

756

我们只需猜想他下一步要干什么
We just have to figure out what he's going to do.

757
01:11:34,745 --> 01:11:38,624
如何赶走艇员
How is he going to get them off the sub?

758
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:43,086
船员要有离艇的意图
They'd have to want to get off.

759
01:11:44,296 --> 01:11:49,134
船员为什么想离开潜艇?
How do you get a crew to want to get off a submarine?

760
01:11:49,301 --> 01:11:53,388
船员为什么想离开核潜艇...
How do you get a crew to want to get off a nuclear sub...

761
01:11:53,555 --> 01:11:57,601

763
01:12:04,608 --> 01:12:10,447
扬基一号  方位270  速度低速  完毕
Yankee One, vector 270. Speed is buster, over.

764
01:12:10,614 --> 01:12:13,075
扬基一号  再说一遍
Say again, Yankee One.

765
01:12:13,241 --> 01:12:15,952
熊狐步号太接近部队
A Bear Foxtrot got too close to the group.

766
01:12:15,952 --> 01:12:18,664
它和一架F14战机相撞
One of the F-14s crowded him, and they bumped.

767
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:24,294
战机损伤  他们引导它返回母舰
He's losing hydraulic fluid. They're trying to get him back aboard now.

768
01:12:24,461 --> 01:12:27,255
-忙碌的早晨  -嗯
-Busy morning.  -Mmm.

769
01:12:27,422 --> 01:12:32,970
昨晚苏联战舰在东边港口戒备
During the night, Russian attack subs are now stationed off every East Coast port.

770
01:12:33,136 --> 01:12:35,639
我们在这里
We're up here.

771
01:12:35,806 --> 01:12:39,059
新泽西舰队赶到海岸
The New Jersey is moving up the coast...

772
01:12:39,226 --> 01:12:42,145
苏军出动攻击型潜艇
while the Russians, aside from over 100 bear foxtrots, have a row of subs...

773
01:12:42,145 --> 01:12:45,065
和海面舰队
and several surface groups.

774
01:12:45,232 --> 01:12:48,610
-火力强大  -对于一支救援队的话  是的
-That's a lot of firepower.  -For a rescue team, yes.

775
01:12:48,777 --> 01:12:50,403
还有一件怪事
And there's something else strange.

776
01:12:50,403 --> 01:12:52,030
他们不关心声纳探测结果
They're using sonar as if they're looking for something, but nobody's listening.

777
01:12:52,030 --> 01:12:55,284
什么意思?
What do you mean?

778
01:12:55,450 --> 01:12:57,831
以30节的速度航行
At their speed of 30 knots,

779
01:12:57,850 --> 01:13:00,831
他们的声音大过我女儿的音响  居然听不到
they could run over my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

780
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:05,337
-他们不是寻找雷米斯  他们驱赶他
-They're not trying to find Ramius, they're trying to drive him.

781
01:13:05,341 --> 01:13:07,337
-驱赶他到哪里?
-Drive him where?

782
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:12,926
赶到敌人的地盘
Hounds to the hunters.

783
01:13:13,093 --> 01:13:17,514
这舰长的确会去美国
Your sub captain is going to make it to America, Mr. Ryan.

784
01:13:17,681 --> 01:13:20,851
他将会在抵岸前身亡
He's going to die within sight of it.

785
01:13:21,018 --> 01:13:25,731
他的僚机要求准许发炮
His wing man kept requesting permission to fire.

786
01:13:25,897 --> 01:13:31,069
若有人轻举妄动  我们会卷入大战
omebody messes up, we'll be in the biggest naval battle since the Jutland. Jesus!

787
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:36,199
-水温太低  不能弹射  -尝试登上甲板
-The water's too cold to eject.  -Air boss will try to bring him aboard.

788
01:13:36,366 --> 01:13:40,495
-这是什么潜艇?  -巴特・曼库索的潜艇
-Excuse me, sir. What's this sub off by herself?  -Bart Mancuso's boat.

789
01:13:40,662 --> 01:13:43,957
他正赶去红航线一号
He's going to the bottom of Red Route One.

790
01:13:44,124 --> 01:13:48,670
他的电脑发现"岩浆移位"
He's had intermittent contact with a magma displacement. He's got this...

791
01:13:48,837 --> 01:13:52,924
岩浆移位? 那不是地震学的问题吗?
Magma displacement? Is that like a seismic anomaly?

792
01:13:53,091 --> 01:13:55,906
应该是的  怎么了
I suppose so. Why?

793
01:13:55,906 --> 01:13:58,722
-可否让我登上达拉斯号?  -去干什么?
-Is there a way you could get me on board the Dallas?  -What for?

794
01:13:58,889 --> 01:14:01,787
曼库索找到红十月号
Help Captain Mancuso found the Red October.

795
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:04,686
他什么都没找到  他只是在等待
He hasn't found anything, Jack. He's just waiting.

796
01:14:04,853 --> 01:14:07,188
长官
Excuse me, sir.

797
01:14:07,188 --> 01:14:09,524
无声推进系统经常被误认为...
But this silent propulsion system could easily be mistaken for something...

798
01:14:09,691 --> 01:14:13,153
只能坐直升机去达拉斯号
Jack, the only way to get you to the Dallas out there is by chopper.

799
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:18,241
直升机可没有这么多燃料
is to use a chopper turned into a flying gas can.

800
01:14:18,408 --> 01:14:23,455
救援扬基一号的部队准备好了
Excuse me, Admiral. Yankee One is on final. Rescue personnel are in place.

801
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:26,333
提升左翼
Pick up your left wing.

802
01:14:26,500 --> 01:14:28,877
禁止着陆!
Power! Wave off!

803
01:14:29,044 --> 01:14:32,047
座舱弹射!
Eject!

804
01:14:45,352 --> 01:14:51,066
这件事  会一发不可收拾
This business will get out of control and we'll be lucky to live through it.

805
01:15:03,787 --> 01:15:06,041
燃料倒是够
The bird's loaded down with enough fuel to get you there,

806
01:15:06,047 --> 01:15:08,041
不过达拉斯号可能会离开原地点
but Dallas may not be there.

807
01:15:08,208 --> 01:15:10,961
我们正在尝试联系它
We're trying to get message to her.

808
01:15:10,961 --> 01:15:13,714
如果它下潜了  如果你要跳伞
If she's gone deep, it's dodgey. If you have to ditch...

809
01:15:21,722 --> 01:15:25,434
如果要跳伞  记得拿求生装备
If you have to ditch, don't think about anything but the survival gear.

810
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:31,522
-这种水温  你只能坚持四分钟
-At this water temperature, you'll have about four minutes.

811
01:15:32,192 --> 01:15:37,863
-我会记住的  下次记在备忘录上算了
-I'll try to remember that. Next time, Jack, write a goddamn memo.

812
01:16:10,938 --> 01:16:14,650
-船长睡了?  -是的
-Is the captain sacked out?  -Yeah.

813
01:16:15,817 --> 01:16:19,863
-他怎么样  -他不愿离开
-What about him?  -He won't leave.

814
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:33,085
我见过美人鱼
You know, I've seen a mermaid once.

815
01:16:33,251 --> 01:16:37,172
还见过鲨鱼吃八爪鱼
I've even seen a shark eat an octopus.

816
01:16:37,339 --> 01:16:41,593
但没见过鬼魅一般的苏联潜艇
But I've never seen a phantom Russian submarine.

817
01:17:20,215 --> 01:17:23,697
我们会探测情况
We're emerging from the route, Captain.

818
01:17:23,697 --> 01:17:25,180
缓冲板会按正常程序进行清理
I've ordered a routine clearing of the baffles.

819
01:17:25,197 --> 01:17:27,180
在数分钟后转向
We'll be making the first turn in a few minutes.

820
01:17:27,347 --> 01:17:33,437
履带推进系统恢复正常工作
The caterpillar is operational and appears to be running normally.

821
01:17:33,604 --> 01:17:39,484
内奸的事令船员人心惶惶
The crew know about the saboteur and they are afraid.

822
01:17:41,403 --> 01:17:45,365
可以在适当时机利用这心态
Well, that could be useful when the time comes.

823
01:17:47,701 --> 01:17:53,123
十六小时后  会到达拉布拉多海岸
You know, we could make the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

824
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:56,918
那里太冷  船员会冻死
Half of them would freeze before they were rescued.

825
01:17:57,085 --> 01:18:01,131
四十八小时后  到马萨诸塞或缅因州
It's Massachusetts or Maine in 48 hours.

826
01:18:01,298 --> 01:18:04,509
两天
Two days.

827
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:16,104
他们会不会让我住在蒙大拿州?
Do you think they will let me live in Montana?

828
01:18:21,526 --> 01:18:26,615
你想住哪里都可以
I would think they'll let you live wherever you want.

829
01:18:26,782 --> 01:18:32,204
好  我会住在蒙大拿州
Good, then I will live in Montana.

830
01:18:32,371 --> 01:18:37,167
娶一个肥胖的美国妻子  养兔子
I will marry a round American woman and raise rabbits.

831
01:18:37,334 --> 01:18:40,837
她会为我做饭
And she will cook them for me.

832
01:18:41,004 --> 01:18:44,675
我会买一辆小货车
And I will have a pickup truck.

833
01:18:44,841 --> 01:18:51,139
可能还会买一辆旅行车
Or possibly even a recreational vehicle...

834
01:18:51,306 --> 01:18:55,310
开着旅行车穿州过省
and drive from state to state.

835
01:18:55,477 --> 01:18:59,606
-可以这样做?  -是的
-Do they let you do that?  -Yes.

836
01:18:59,773 --> 01:19:04,444
-不必申请?  -无须申请  穿州过省
-No papers?  -No papers. State to state.

837
01:19:04,611 --> 01:19:07,823
好  开始转向
All right. Commence your turn.

838
01:19:10,909 --> 01:19:17,082
冬天住在亚利桑那州
Well then... in winter, I will live in Arizona.

839
01:19:17,249 --> 01:19:22,838
-我需要两个妻子  -至少两个
-Actually, I think I will need two wives.  -Oh, at least.

840
01:19:32,514 --> 01:19:39,271
-目标可能想转向  -是的  方位变了
-Possible aspect change on target.  -Sonar, Concur, change in bearing rate.

841
01:19:42,733 --> 01:19:46,987
-指挥室  疯狂伊凡!  -停车  保持安静
-Conn! Sonar! Crazy Ivan!  -All stop. Quick quiet!

842
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,893
发生了什么  钟斯?
What's going on, Jonesy?

843
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:01,126
苏联潜艇会突然急转  以探查自己是否被跟踪
Russian captains sometimes turn suddenly to see if anyone's behind them.

844
01:20:01,293 --> 01:20:04,630
我们称之为"疯狂伊凡"
We call it Crazy Ivan.

845
01:20:04,796 --> 01:20:07,465
我们要关掉所有机器
The only thing you can do is go dead, shut everything down...

846
01:20:07,465 --> 01:20:10,135
销声匿迹
and make like a hole in the water.

847
01:20:10,302 --> 01:20:16,934
-还有什么问题?  -大船不能一下子停下来
-So what's the catch? -Catch is a boat this big doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

848
01:20:17,100 --> 01:20:22,564
如果我们太近  会被卷进它的船尾
If we're too close, we'll drift right into the back of him.

849
01:20:24,733 --> 01:20:28,195
你呢  有什么心愿?
What about you? What do you look forward to?

850
01:20:37,454 --> 01:20:42,960
我再没有这种心情
I have no such appetites.

851
01:20:43,126 --> 01:20:46,964
看看他们能否能听见我们
Let's see if he can hear us.

852
01:20:51,677 --> 01:20:54,179
一定还有事情想做
There must be something.

853
01:21:02,104 --> 01:21:05,274
你想做什么?
What is it?

854
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:12,030
我怀念小时候
I miss the peace of fishing.

855
01:21:12,197 --> 01:21:15,909
宁静地钓鱼的日子
Like when I was a boy.

856
01:21:17,452 --> 01:21:24,084
四十年来  我一直航海  海上的战争
40 years I've been sailing at sea. A war at sea.

857
01:21:26,086 --> 01:21:33,093
一场没有战役的战争  没有纪念碑
A war with no battles. No monuments.

858
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:36,680
只有死伤者
Only casualties.

859
01:21:40,058 --> 01:21:44,021
妻子在结婚当日  变成寡妇
I widowed her the day I married her.

860
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:50,694
她去世的时候  我还在船上
My wife died while I was at sea.

861
01:22:09,338 --> 01:22:12,424
找人看守轮机舱
Post guards in the engineering spaces.

862
01:22:12,591 --> 01:22:17,429
弄坏履带的人  会做出更严重的破坏
If he can get to the caterpillar, he can get to somewhere more vital.

863
01:22:20,349 --> 01:22:23,164
钟斯  他在那里?
Where is he, Jonesy?

864
01:22:23,164 --> 01:22:25,979
目标在我们右舷
Conn, Sonar. Target is now coming out of our starboard baffles.

865
01:22:26,146 --> 01:22:30,484
他想回到原来的路线
My read is that he's returning to base course.

866
01:22:30,651 --> 01:22:36,365
-他回到航线210  -他环绕我们
-Concur, he's returning to course 210.  -He went right around us.

867
01:22:36,531 --> 01:22:41,578
等三十秒  然后取消静航
Give him another 30 seconds. Then secure from silent running.

868
01:22:41,745 --> 01:22:46,375
我们收到讯息
Captain, here's what we got on the ELF.

869
01:22:48,335 --> 01:22:50,921
-谢谢  -不用谢  长官
-Thanks.  -Aye, sir.

870
01:22:58,095 --> 01:23:01,932
是什么?
What is it?

871
01:23:02,099 --> 01:23:05,185
你绝对不相信
You're not going to believe this.

872
01:23:17,489 --> 01:23:19,658
我们要及早返航
Commander, we're approaching no return.

873
01:23:19,658 --> 01:23:21,827
达拉斯号没收到信息
Dallas apparently hasn't gotten the message.

874
01:23:21,994 --> 01:23:24,225
-我们要返航  -再等一会儿
-We have to turn back.  -Give it a couple more minutes.

875
01:23:24,225 --> 01:23:26,456
不行  燃料快不够了
Negative. Fuel status says we turn around now.

876
01:23:26,623 --> 01:23:30,752
等等  你们没有后备燃料吗?
Wait a minute. Fuel status? You got a reserve, don't you?

877
01:23:30,919 --> 01:23:32,983
我有十分钟后备燃料
Yes, sir. I've got a ten minute reserve.

878
01:23:32,983 --> 01:23:35,048
但只有作战时才可动用
But I'm not allowed to invade that except during war.

879
01:23:35,215 --> 01:23:39,970
如果你不让我上潜艇  战争会爆发
Mr. If you don't get me on that goddamn submarine, you might have it.

880
01:23:40,137 --> 01:23:44,308
如果有燃料  我们再等十分钟吧
You got 10 minutes worth of fuel. we stay here ten more minutes.

881
01:23:47,811 --> 01:23:53,275
东边两英里处发现潜艇
Yo! Mount up! Yo, I got a submarine at around 3:00. About two miles.

882
01:23:55,611 --> 01:23:57,946
好  给他戴上工具
Okay, Tony, hook him up.

883
01:23:57,946 --> 01:24:00,282
好的  我们把你放到潜艇下面去
OK, Commander. I'll be lowering you down to the submarine now.

884
01:24:00,449 --> 01:24:05,245
希望这东西能把烟当作燃料
Give me eight minutes. Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

885
01:24:05,412 --> 01:24:11,293
浮上海面  这家伙要吃苦了
Very well. Surface the ship. Whoever this guy is, he's in for one hell of a ride.

886
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:14,963
好了  坐下来
Okay, Commander, go ahead and sit down.

887
01:24:15,130 --> 01:24:20,302
-有经验吗?  -试过一次  当时风平浪静
-Did you ever do this before?  -Once, on a calm day... off Hawaii.

888
01:24:20,469 --> 01:24:24,056
直升机无法稳定地飞行
The pilot will have a difficult time keeping steady.

889
01:24:24,222 --> 01:24:27,392
拿着这棒  以防电击
Don't take chances getting grounded. Keep that rod in front of you.

890
01:24:27,559 --> 01:24:32,105
旋翼的静电  能点亮芝加哥城
In air like this, the rotors will be putting out enough static to light up Chicago.

891
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:36,735
我预备了潜水员  他可能会坠海
A diver's in the escape trunk in case this guy goes in the drink.

892
01:24:36,902 --> 01:24:40,572
对  这疯子想玩命!
Someone must have a burr up his ass to go for a stunt like this.

893
01:25:05,013 --> 01:25:08,934
如果我要把你带上来  我会摇绳子和竖起大拇指
Commander, if I got to bring you back up, I'm going to shake the wire.

894
01:25:09,101 --> 01:25:13,981
两手交叉  记住了吗?
I'll give you a thumbs up, like this. Remember to cross your arms.

895
01:25:14,147 --> 01:25:17,317
好的  出发吧
Okay, out you go. Passenger's out the door.

896
01:25:24,491 --> 01:25:28,161
乘客出来了  在半空中往前荡
He's halfway down. You're drifting forward.

897
01:25:32,457 --> 01:25:35,794
好的  勾着他的绳
All right. Get the hook on his cable.

898
01:25:35,961 --> 01:25:40,007
注意  别碰他  他来了
Watch it! Don't touch him. Okay, here he comes.

899
01:25:46,888 --> 01:25:51,226
风太大了  我看不见他
It'd be easier without that crosswind. I can't see him.

900
01:25:53,687 --> 01:25:56,565
别碰他
Don't touch him!

901
01:26:01,153 --> 01:26:05,741
-行不通  -拉他回来吧
-This is never going to work.  -OK. Reel him back in.

902
01:26:12,706 --> 01:26:15,584
托尼  他怎么了...
Tony, what's the hell going on back...

903
01:26:18,462 --> 01:26:21,381
达拉斯号  有没有准备潜水员?
Dallas, have you got a swimmer?

904
01:26:21,548 --> 01:26:26,178
有人在左舷坠海  派出潜水员
Man overboard, port side. Send out the diver.

905
01:26:26,345 --> 01:26:30,349
好的  达拉斯号  我们要走了
Very well. Dallas, we are history.

906
01:26:37,898 --> 01:26:42,152
救下面那位博士  我去逃生舱
Get the doc down here. I'll be in the escape trunk.

907
01:26:45,280 --> 01:26:49,242
拿梯子来  打开舱盖
Down ladder. Make a hole.

908
01:27:04,841 --> 01:27:09,554
你好  舰长  我很高兴能上舰
How do you do, Captain? It's a pleasure to be aboard.

909
01:27:11,848 --> 01:27:15,519
我要跟总统说话
I have to talk to the President.

910
01:27:15,686 --> 01:27:19,147
好的  请问为何事?
Of course. May I enquire as to the subject?

911
01:27:20,941 --> 01:27:24,256
看来我们先前的报告不太准确
It seems that the initial reports that...

912
01:27:24,256 --> 01:27:27,572
我们的潜艇没有失踪
one of our submarines was missing were not completely accurate.

913
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:34,913
该艘潜艇由马尔科・雷米斯指挥
The submarine in question is commanded by Captain Marko Ramius.

914
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:40,585
他陷入精神崩溃的状态
Apparently, he has suffered a kind of mental nervous breakdown.

915
01:27:42,087 --> 01:27:48,343
在出发前  他寄信给巴度宁上将
Just before he sailed, he posted a letter to Admiral Padorin...

916
01:27:48,510 --> 01:27:51,388
他宣称  想向美国...
in which he announced his intention to...

917
01:27:53,599 --> 01:27:56,643
发射导弹
to fire his missiles on the United States.

918
01:27:58,312 --> 01:28:01,064
上次为什么不告诉我?
Why didn't you tell me this the last time we met?

919
01:28:01,231 --> 01:28:03,566
莫斯科不会
In my position I'm sometimes compromised...

920
01:28:03,566 --> 01:28:05,902
告诉我所有事情
by the fact Moscow doesn't always tell me everything.

921
01:28:06,069 --> 01:28:10,866
你们的潜艇舰长疯了? 你要我们怎么做?
So one of your submarine captains has gone insane? What do you want from us?

922
01:28:11,033 --> 01:28:14,369
需要你们帮个忙
You offered your assistance.

923
01:28:14,369 --> 01:28:17,706
本来是个营救行动  现在你让我们帮你除掉他
That was a rescue mission. Now you want us to help you hunt him down and kill him.

924
01:28:19,124 --> 01:28:24,171
我奉命来请贵国总统帮忙
I have been instructed to ask your president for precisely that.

925
01:28:24,338 --> 01:28:29,718
我们已经找到他  但我们要为你停下来
Find him? We already found him. We had to break off to pick you up.

926
01:28:29,885 --> 01:28:34,139
-喝杯咖啡  还是抽支烟?  -我不抽烟
-Coffee. A cigarette?  -I don't smoke.

927
01:28:34,306 --> 01:28:39,102
假设我们找到他  然后怎么办?
Assuming we can find him, just what exactly am I supposed to do about it?

928
01:28:39,269 --> 01:28:43,523
舰长  通讯室报告  收到紧急讯号
Captain, radio. We're receiving flash traffic on the emergency circuit.

929
01:28:43,690 --> 01:28:45,859
好的  翻译它
Very well. Bring it down.

930
01:28:47,444 --> 01:28:50,155
瑞恩先生
Well, Mr. Ryan?

931
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:56,411
-大副  让我们单独谈谈  -雷纳德  过来
-Chief, excuse us for a second.  -Leonard, come on out of there.

932
01:29:02,793 --> 01:29:05,796
我们在追踪红十月号
The sub we're after is called the Red October.

933
01:29:05,796 --> 01:29:08,799
舰长是马尔科・雷米斯
She's under the command of a man named Ramius.

934
01:29:08,966 --> 01:29:11,739
他和艇上部分军官
Now, there's the possibility that he and a good portion...

935
01:29:11,739 --> 01:29:14,513
可能想叛变
of his crew are attempting to defect.

936
01:29:16,932 --> 01:29:19,851
叛变?
Defect?

937
01:29:20,018 --> 01:29:22,145
对不起
Excuse me.

938
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:41,247
-那潜艇叫红十月号?  -对
-You say the boat's called the Red October?  -That's right.

939
01:29:41,247 --> 01:29:43,875
-舰长是雷米斯?  -对
-Skipper's Ramius?  -Right.

940
01:29:44,042 --> 01:29:49,214
看来形势转变了  瑞恩
It seems that circumstances have changed somewhat, Mr. Ryan.

941
01:29:56,179 --> 01:30:00,309
-给他干衣服  我在指挥台等他  -遵命  舰长
-Get this man some dry clothes. I'll be in the conn.  -Aye, sir.

942
01:30:00,475 --> 01:30:02,852
"苏军潜艇红十月号舰长
"National Command Authority informed Soviet typhoon class submarine...

943
01:30:02,852 --> 01:30:05,230
马尔科・雷米斯
Red October Marko Ramius...

944
01:30:05,397 --> 01:30:10,152
可能叛变  准备擅自发射导弹"
is potential renegade and threatens independent missile launch.

945
01:30:10,319 --> 01:30:13,509
"你有权采取任何行动
"You are authorized to use any necessary force...

946
01:30:13,509 --> 01:30:16,700
防止它接近美国海岸"
to prevent said submarine from approaching the coast of the United States."

947
01:30:31,048 --> 01:30:35,969
左转10度  航向265
Left 10 degrees rudder steady on course 265.

948
01:30:39,806 --> 01:30:42,684
舱内亮红色灯
Chief of the Watch, rig for red.

949
01:30:52,986 --> 01:30:55,468
-什么事?  -已部署好战斗岗位
-What's going on?  -Battle stations are manned and ready, Captain.

950
01:30:55,468 --> 01:30:57,950
很好
Very well.

951
01:30:58,116 --> 01:31:01,223
舰长  我要跟你谈谈
Captain, I have to talk to you.

952
01:31:01,223 --> 01:31:04,331
现在不行  潜至一千二百英尺  俯倾20度
Not now. Tommy, make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down angle.

953
01:31:04,498 --> 01:31:09,836
潜水官  潜至一千二百英尺  俯倾20度
Diving officer, make your depth 1,200 feet, 20 degrees down.

954
01:31:10,003 --> 01:31:15,884
全速下潜
Full dive on fair water planes. Full dive on stern planes.

955
01:31:18,762 --> 01:31:22,599
450英尺  潜至1200英尺
Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

956
01:31:22,766 --> 01:31:25,519
500英尺
500.

957
01:31:26,895 --> 01:31:29,690
600英尺
600.

958
01:31:29,856 --> 01:31:33,151
700英尺
700.

959
01:31:36,947 --> 01:31:40,575
-一切顺利?  -是的  舰长
-Did you get a good fix?  -Yes, Captain.

960
01:31:47,165 --> 01:31:52,129
-钟斯  发现他了吗?  -很微弱  舰长  正在监听
-Sonar, conn, have you got him yet, Jonesy?  -Very faint, sir. Hold on.

961
01:31:53,672 --> 01:31:58,176
250方位  发现台风七号  在我们预想的位置
Yes, sir. Contact typhoon seven on bearing 250. Right where he's supposed to be.

962
01:31:58,343 --> 01:32:02,889
-他有否发觉我们?  -没有
-Any sign he's alerted to our presence?  -No. Operating as before.

963
01:32:03,056 --> 01:32:08,145
左转到265  溜到他们背后
Come left to 265. Bring us up behind him quietly, Tommy.

964
01:32:08,312 --> 01:32:10,897
再下潜五百英尺
Make your depth 500 feet.

965
01:32:20,073 --> 01:32:23,493
舰长  让我说两分钟
Please listen to me. Two minutes, that's all.

966
01:32:25,495 --> 01:32:29,750
-导航  何时能进入它的航道?  -四分钟后
-Plot, time to intercept his track.  -Four minutes, Captain.

967
01:32:29,916 --> 01:32:33,253
好吧  给你两分钟  瑞恩
Very well, Mr. Ryan. Two minutes.

968
01:32:39,843 --> 01:32:43,764
那些指示很合理  但实情是...
I understand that message, it makes perfect sense. But the situation is...

969
01:32:43,931 --> 01:32:46,266
雷米斯想叛变
Ramius intends to defect.

970
01:32:46,266 --> 01:32:48,602
所以苏军一直想击沉他
The Russians know this, which is why they've tried to sink him...

971
01:32:48,769 --> 01:32:51,021
-但他们无能为力  -发炮程式准备好了
-but they haven't been able to. So... -I have a firing solution.

972
01:32:51,021 --> 01:32:53,273
很好
Very well.

973
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:55,546
舰长  听我说
Captain, you have to listen to me.

974
01:32:55,546 --> 01:32:57,653
苏军想要不惜一切代价阻止雷米斯叛变
The Russians will stop at nothing to prevent Ramius from defecting.

975
01:32:57,819 --> 01:33:00,676
所以他们骗我们说他疯了
They've invented this story that he's crazy...

976
01:33:00,676 --> 01:33:03,533
想让我们击沉他
because they need us to sink him before he can contact us.

977
01:33:05,869 --> 01:33:11,416
启动保安系统  我不想鱼雷反过来对付我们
Weapons control, I want full safeties. I don't want this fish coming back.

978
01:33:11,583 --> 01:33:14,836
舰长  我认识这个人
Captain, I know this man.

979
01:33:15,879 --> 01:33:18,840
他有没有做"疯狂伊凡"?
Has he made any Crazy Ivans?

980
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:21,802
-那有什么关系  -下一次是右转
-What difference does that make?  -His next one will be to starboard.

981
01:33:21,969 --> 01:33:26,932
因为过了三十分  他总会右转
Because he goes to starboard in the bottom half of the hour.

982
01:33:29,726 --> 01:33:32,604
调整1号2号鱼雷管  准备发炮
Flood tubes one and two. Warm up the weapons.

983
01:33:32,771 --> 01:33:35,317
舰长  设法跟他联络吧
Captain, find a way to establish contact without violating orders.

984
01:33:35,321 --> 01:33:37,317
他想叛变!
He wants to defect!

985
01:33:37,484 --> 01:33:42,489
叫沃森拿枪到指挥室来
Mr. Thompson, Call Chief Watson to the conn with his sidearm.

986
01:33:46,410 --> 01:33:50,914
声纳讯号转变  目标方位变化
Conn, Sonar. Signal to noise ratio's dropping. Possible aspect change in target.

987
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:54,418
目标可能在移动
Possible target zig based on bearing rate.

988
01:33:55,585 --> 01:33:58,171
疯狂伊凡
Conn, Sonar. Crazy Ivan!

989
01:34:00,882 --> 01:34:05,470
舰长  他转过来了
Captain, he's turning.

990
01:34:08,849 --> 01:34:12,686
-他向哪边转?  -右转
-Which way is he turning, Jonesy?  -To the starboard, sir!

991
01:34:12,853 --> 01:34:16,565
给他个机会
Give the man a chance.

992
01:34:18,483 --> 01:34:21,403
-全速后退  -舰长  再说一遍
-All back full.  -Captain, say again.

993
01:34:21,570 --> 01:34:24,865
-全速后退!  -是  长官
-I said all back full!  -Back full. Aye, sir.

994
01:34:29,661 --> 01:34:35,626
-水里形成空洞  他会听见我们  -停车
-Captain, we're cavitating! He can hear us.  -Conn, aye. All stop.

995
01:34:36,335 --> 01:34:38,879
我们暴露了行踪
All right. We just unzipped our fly.

996
01:34:39,046 --> 01:34:44,217
开启外门  准备开火
Mr. Thompson, open the outer doors. Firing point procedures.

997
01:34:44,384 --> 01:34:48,513
只要他有任何异动  我会立刻发炮
Now, if that bastard so much as twitches, I'm going to blow him right to Mars.

998
01:34:48,680 --> 01:34:51,433
停车  回舵到0度
All stop rudder amid ship.

999
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:54,978
能否辨认对方?
Can you identify the contact?

1000
01:34:55,145 --> 01:34:57,772
美国洛杉矶级潜艇  方位: 015  距离: 300米
American Los Angeles-class attack submarine. Bearing: 015. Range: 300 metres.

1001
01:34:57,772 --> 01:35:00,400
舰长  瞬时金属声
Captain, sharp metallic transients.

1002
01:35:00,567 --> 01:35:03,278
他可能想打开鱼雷盖
He may be trying to open his torpedo tube doors.

1003
01:35:03,445 --> 01:35:06,657
外门开启了  准备开火
Outer doors are open on tubes one and two. We're ready to shoot.

1004
01:35:06,823 --> 01:35:11,328
好  我的命令很明确
Very well. My orders are specific, Mr. Ryan.

1005
01:35:11,495 --> 01:35:14,581
他开了外门  准备开火
Captain, he has opened his outer doors. He's preparing to fire.

1006
01:35:14,748 --> 01:35:19,586
调整3号4号鱼雷管  准备开火
Flood tubes three and four and plot a solution.

1007
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:24,549
要不要打开鱼雷盖?
Shall I open the torpedo tube doors, sir?

1008
01:35:27,511 --> 01:35:32,849
-舰长  要开启外门吗?  -不
-Captain, shall I open outer doors?  -No.

1009
01:35:33,016 --> 01:35:36,812
用电脑记下发炮程序
Lock the firing solution into the computer.

1010
01:35:36,979 --> 01:35:40,023
千万不要开门
Do not open the doors.

1011
01:35:46,321 --> 01:35:52,286
是  舰长  向电脑输入发炮程序
Aye, Captain. Lock solution into computer.

1012
01:35:52,452 --> 01:35:57,499
-目标准备了鱼雷管  -他有没有开外门?
-Conn, Sonar. Target has flooded his tubes.  -Has he opened his outer doors?

-目标在往上浮升  -那是什么意思?
-Target is coming shallow.  -What does that mean?

1015
01:36:09,553 --> 01:36:12,723
这位苏联人很聪明
It means he's a very cool customer, your Russian.

1016
01:36:12,889 --> 01:36:14,738
他知道我们已经准备好发炮

他不想煽动我们发炮
He's not provoking us.

1018
01:36:16,587 --> 01:36:18,437
他上浮至潜望镜深度观察情况
He's heading to periscope depth to see what's on the surface.

1019
01:36:18,604 --> 01:36:22,774
-他在什么方位?  -270  向着西面

-武器情况如何?  -准备好了
-Weapons status?  -Weapons are on.

1027
01:37:12,866 --> 01:37:17,537
3号和4号鱼雷准备好了  但外门未开启
Tubes three and four are flooded, but outer doors are closed.

1028
01:37:20,037 --> 01:37:21,937
记录此位置
Mark this bearing.

1029
01:37:29,883 --> 01:37:36,139
你想跟他谈话吗? 他在这儿  你想说什么?

-是他在看潜望镜吗?  -可能是吧
-Will he be the only one looking through the periscope?  -Probably.

1031

我要冒险一试
We'll have to chance that.

1032

"听说阁下想发射导弹"

"别接近美国海岸线  否则我们会进攻"
"Do not approach US coast or you will be attacked."

"If intention is other, will you discuss option?"

1035
01:38:00,163 --> 01:38:03,417
他可否以一下声响示意?
Can he acknowledge with a single ping?

1036
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:07,629
可以  但他会答复吗?

1040
01:38:35,157 --> 01:38:39,202
好  "如要叛变"

1041
01:38:45,959 --> 01:38:50,631
我要一张航海图
Chart. I need a chart.

1042
01:38:52,716 --> 01:38:57,512
我们在哪里? 一个水深的地方...
OK. Where the hell are we? Someplace deep. Someplace deep...

1043
01:38:58,212 --> 01:38:59,632

告诉我  你怎知道他会右转
Tell me one thing. How did you know he was going to go to starboard?

1047
01:39:19,785 --> 01:39:25,248
我不知道  我想碰碰运气来打断你  对不起
I didn't. I had a 50-50 chance and I needed a break. Sorry.

1048
01:39:27,084 --> 01:39:30,587
不要紧  很久没使用摩斯密码...
That's all right, Mr. Ryan. My Morse is so rusty...

1049
01:39:30,754 --> 01:39:35,217
我可能发出了美女三围数字
I may be sending him dimensions on playmate of the month.

1050

这是什么意思?
What the hell is this about?

1055
01:40:19,011 --> 01:40:24,766
苏联人希望我们击沉它  我们可能真的要这么做了
The Russians want us to sink her. We might have to do that.

1056
01:40:32,482 --> 01:40:36,486
我们要给美国人一点回旋余地

1136
01:53:19,917 --> 01:53:23,170
什么事这么好笑?
What's so funny?

1137
01:53:23,337 --> 01:53:27,341
舰长说你像牛仔
The captain thinks you're some sort of cowboy.

1138
01:53:27,507 --> 01:53:35,182
-你会俄语  -会一点
-You speak Russian.  -A little.

1139
01:53:35,349 --> 01:53:41,480
知己知彼  百战百胜
It's wise to study the ways of one's adversary.

1140
01:53:41,647 --> 01:53:43,732
说得对
It is.

1141
01:53:45,734 --> 01:53:50,697
你还记得吗  我们在列宁格勒领事馆见过面
I doubt you'd remember, but we met once at the consulate in Leningrad.

1142
01:53:50,864 --> 01:53:56,453
尊夫人的事  我很难过
Along with your wife. I'm very sorry.

1143
01:53:56,620 --> 01:54:01,375
为什么无故向我的船发炮?
What gives you the right to fire on my ship?

1144
01:54:01,541 --> 01:54:05,796
-你的讯息没有提及鱼雷  -瑞恩
-Your signal said nothing of a torpedo.  -Ryan.

1145
01:54:07,047 --> 01:54:09,862
我们要误导你的船员
It was necessary to maintain the illusion for your crew.

1146
01:54:09,862 --> 01:54:12,678
他们会获救吗?
My crew are being rescued, yes?

1147
01:54:12,844 --> 01:54:16,807
救援行动已开始
As we speak.

1148
01:54:18,934 --> 01:54:24,022
-是你发的讯号?  -是的
-You sent the signal?  -That's correct, sir.

1149
01:54:24,189 --> 01:54:30,112
你怎么知道我们的反应堆事故是假的?
Then how did you know our reactor accident was false?

1150
01:54:30,279 --> 01:54:33,407
我循常理推测的
That was a guess, but it seemed logical.

1151
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:42,833
很好
Very well.

1152
01:54:45,502 --> 01:54:51,091
我把弹道导弹潜艇红十月号交出来
I present to you the ballistic missile submarine Red October.

1153
01:54:55,304 --> 01:55:01,852
我和军官们要求美国庇护
My officers and I request asylum in the United States of America.

1154
01:55:04,229 --> 01:55:09,693
幸会  我是达拉斯号的巴特・曼库索舰长
It's a pleasure, sir. Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1155
01:55:11,903 --> 01:55:14,635
鱼雷  美国人又开火了
Torpedo. The Americans are shooting at us again.

1156
01:55:14,635 --> 01:55:18,067
声调太高了  这是苏联鱼雷
The pitch is too high. The torpedo's Russian.

1157
01:55:18,137 --> 01:55:21,388
还有鱼雷? 从哪里来
What do you mean another torpedo? Where the hell did it come from?

1158
01:55:21,455 --> 01:55:25,459
指挥室  声纳发现苏联雅夫级潜艇  呼号4-1
Conn, Sonar. New contact. Sierra 4-1. Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1159
01:55:28,795 --> 01:55:32,111
声纳  为何不引爆?
Sonar, why don't I have a detonation?

1160
01:55:32,111 --> 01:55:33,727
目标距离太近
The weapon enabled on the far side of the target.

1161
01:55:33,731 --> 01:55:35,427
鱼雷来不及引爆
It passed Red October before arming.

1162
01:55:35,594 --> 01:55:39,640
你计算错误  重新装填  以正确参数重新发射鱼雷
You had the wrong range. Fire again with the right setting and reload both tubes.

1163
01:55:39,806 --> 01:55:44,770
加强能源  叫深海救助艇离开
Get me power, and get that damn thing off my boat.

1164
01:55:44,937 --> 01:55:50,233
-有人向我们发射鱼雷  -混帐  走吧
-I think somebody shot a torpedo at us.  -No shit, Buckwheat. Get out of here.

1165
01:55:58,575 --> 01:56:02,996
舰长正在与他们交战
The captain is fighting them.

1166
01:56:05,874 --> 01:56:09,086
鲍罗丁  负责火控
Borodin, fire control.

1167
01:56:09,253 --> 01:56:14,091
-瑞恩  坐在这里  -我不是海军  我是中情局人员
-Ryan, sit here.  -I'm not a naval officer. I'm with the CIA.

1168
01:56:14,258 --> 01:56:18,470
-中情局?  -我只是为他们写书
-CIA?  -I'm not an agent. I just write books for the CIA.

1169
01:56:19,763 --> 01:56:22,849
不管这些  坐下来  照我的吩咐做
Whatever. Sit down. And do exactly what I tell you.

1170
01:56:23,016 --> 01:56:26,520
深潜救助艇已离开  苏联雅夫级潜艇在右舷八千码外
DSRV's away. There's a Russian alfa 8,000 yards to starboard.

1171
01:56:26,687 --> 01:56:32,901
-看来是科诺瓦洛夫号  -超速前进
-Captain, I think it's the Konovalov.  -Increase to flank.

1172
01:56:33,027 --> 01:56:38,031
-超速前进  怎么操作?  -这个旋钮  向右扭死
-Increase to flank. How?  -That knob. Turn right full.

1173
01:56:38,198 --> 01:56:42,244
-超速前进  右满舵  -他再次开火
-All ahead flank. Right full rudder.  -He's shooting again, sir.

1174
01:56:42,411 --> 01:56:45,581
部署战斗岗位
Put battle stations.

1175
01:56:50,586 --> 01:56:55,299
-鱼雷发射  方位315  -距离700码
-Torpedo in the water. Bearing 315.  -Make range 7,000 yards.

1176
01:56:55,465 --> 01:57:01,930
-右转到方位315  -朝着鱼雷冲过去
-Steer right 315.  -That's heading into the torpedo.

1177
01:57:02,097 --> 01:57:08,437
-距离六千码  -右转到方位315
-Estimate range 6,000 yards.  -Steer right 315.

1178
01:57:08,604 --> 01:57:12,858
不  瑞恩  千万别转方向  我们冲向鱼雷
No, that's wrong! Ryan, don't turn that goddamn wheel.

1179
01:57:13,025 --> 01:57:16,278
航向315
315.

1180
01:57:26,580 --> 01:57:30,709
-你想冲向鱼雷  -是的
-You're heading straight for that torpedo.  -Yes.

1181
01:57:30,876 --> 01:57:34,880
-什么?  -他冲向鱼雷
-Doing what?  -He's turned into the torpedo's path.

1182
01:57:35,047 --> 01:57:37,591
-什么?  -红十月号直接冲向鱼雷  长官
-What?  -Red October's turned directly into the torpedo's path, sir.

1183
01:57:37,591 --> 01:57:40,135
-他直接冲向鱼雷  -我的天
-Red October's turned directly into the torpedo's path, sir.  -Mother of God!

1184
01:57:40,302 --> 01:57:44,848
鱼雷在方位315  距离: 5000码
Torpedo steady, bearing 315. Range: 5,000 yards.

1185
01:57:45,015 --> 01:57:49,019
-再加速  -不行  我们已推动至110%
-Melekhin, more speed.  -Negative. We're already at 110%.

1186
01:57:49,186 --> 01:57:54,816
-那就以115%推进  -估计距离: 300码  快速接近中
-Then give it run at 115%.  -Estimate range: 3,000 yards. Closing awfully fast.

1187
01:58:01,531 --> 01:58:03,043
他想冲向鱼雷...
He's heading right at the torpedo.

1188
01:58:03,043 --> 01:58:04,555
自杀
What's he trying to do, kill himself?

1189
01:58:04,555 --> 01:58:06,067
我们能否
We have a firing solution...

1190
01:58:06,067 --> 01:58:07,579
向苏联雅夫级潜艇开火?
on the Russian alfa. Can we shoot back?

1191
01:58:07,746 --> 01:58:12,501
他们没有向我们开火  我不能擅自向苏联潜艇开火
They didn't shoot at us. I can't attack a Soviet submarine without authorization.

1192
01:58:15,128 --> 01:58:20,717
鱼雷方位315  当前距离: 900码
Torpedo bearing steady at 315. Last range: 900 yards.

1193
01:58:20,884 --> 01:58:25,138
鱼雷20秒后命中
Torpedo impact: 20 seconds.

1194
01:58:26,431 --> 01:58:30,602
-什么书?  -你说什么?
-What books?  -Pardon me?

1195
01:58:30,769 --> 01:58:36,275
-你写过什么书?  -我写过哈尔西上将的传记
-What books did you write?  -A biography on Admiral Halsey...

1196
01:58:36,441 --> 01:58:43,031
-关于海军战斗战略的  -我看过那本书
-called The Fighting Sailor, about naval combat tactics.  -I know this book.

1197
01:58:43,198 --> 01:58:48,078
你的结论错了  哈尔西战术失当
Your conclusions were all wrong, Ryan. Halsey acted stupidly.

1198
01:58:48,245 --> 01:58:53,333
九  八  七  六...
Nine, eight, seven, six...

1199
01:58:53,500 --> 01:58:59,339
五  四  三  二...
five, four, three, two...

1200
01:58:59,506 --> 01:59:02,759
鱼雷现在命中目标
Torpedo impact... now.

1201
01:59:12,102 --> 01:59:15,939
我的天
I'll be dammed.

1202
01:59:16,106 --> 01:59:20,611
-怎么了?  -这是战略
-What happened?  -Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

1203
01:59:20,777 --> 01:59:22,825
舰长将射程缩短了
By turning into the torpedo,

1204
01:59:22,877 --> 01:59:26,825
鱼雷来不及引爆
the captain closed the distance before it could arm itself.

1205
01:59:26,992 --> 01:59:29,828
-没事了?  -还不一定
-So that's it?  -Not quite.

1206
01:59:29,995 --> 01:59:33,623
图波列夫舰长会解除武器安全系统
Right now, Captain Tupolev is removing the safety features on all his weapons.

1207
01:59:33,623 --> 01:59:37,252
他不会重蹈覆辙
He won't make the same mistake twice.

1208
01:59:37,419 --> 01:59:42,758
-瓦西里  发炮程式准备好了?  -还没完全准备好...
-Vasily, have you plotted a solution yet?  -It's a little rough, but I...

1209
01:59:49,264 --> 01:59:52,392
-枪声  -听起来好像是的  长官
-Gunfire.  -That's what it sounded like, sir.

1210
01:59:52,559 --> 01:59:56,396
-他不会改变主意?  -是船员作怪
-He won't change his mind, Mr. Ryan.  -It's one of the crew.

1211
01:59:56,563 --> 02:00:00,400
不管他是谁  他有二心
Well, Whoever he is, I'd say he's having second thoughts.

1212
02:00:16,416 --> 02:00:19,836
我想看看蒙大拿
I would like to have seen Montana.

1213
02:00:32,933 --> 02:00:35,957
舰长  他跑进导弹库
Captain, he stumbled forward into the missile bay.

1214
02:00:35,957 --> 02:00:38,981
20号舱响起警报
There's a silo hatch warning... port side, number 20.

1215
02:00:39,147 --> 02:00:43,318
-他不能发射导弹吧?  -不能  但是他能够引爆导弹
-He can't launch a missile?  -No, but he can blow one up.

1216
02:00:45,529 --> 02:00:48,617
舰长  守着指挥台
Captain, take the conn. Fire control's blasted to hell.

1217
02:00:48,629 --> 02:00:50,617
躲在他后面吧
Get in behind him and stay there.

1218
02:00:50,784 --> 02:00:53,495
舰长  慢着
Captain, wait.

1219
02:00:56,164 --> 02:00:59,293
你可能需要这个  舰长
You may need this, sir.

1220
02:01:02,004 --> 02:01:04,298
谢谢
Thank you.

1221
02:01:06,925 --> 02:01:09,907
别光站着  跟着他  拿着家伙过去
Don't just stand there, Ryan, go with him!

1222
02:01:09,907 --> 02:01:11,398
-你会说英语?  -是的
-You, you speak English?  -Yes, sir.

1223
02:01:11,398 --> 02:01:12,889
你也跟着去
get your butt over here.

1224
02:01:13,056 --> 02:01:16,393
舰长  鱼雷未命中
Captain, torpedo broke off on impact.

1225
02:01:16,393 --> 02:01:18,061
妈的  解除鱼雷保险
Goddamn it! Set the safety ranges for zero now.

1226
02:01:18,061 --> 02:01:19,730
舰长  我已经尽快在弄了
Captain, I can't go any faster.

1227
02:01:19,896 --> 02:01:24,443
千万不能让他破坏点火电路
We must get him before he gets to the ignition circuits.

1228
02:01:31,575 --> 02:01:35,120
破坏点火电路会有什么后果?
What happens if he gets to that ignition circuitry?

1229
02:01:35,287 --> 02:01:38,290
他会烧毁整艘潜艇
He can incinerate the ship.

1230
02:01:45,672 --> 02:01:50,344
-这个门是唯一出口?  -是的
-That door is the only way out of here?  -Yes.

1231
02:01:50,510 --> 02:01:55,682
-别让他跑掉  -瑞恩...
-Don't let him get past you.  -Ryan...

1232
02:01:55,849 --> 02:01:59,227
小心开枪
Be careful what you shoot at.

1233
02:01:59,394 --> 02:02:04,232
这里有很多东西不能中弹
Most things in here don't react too well to bullets.

1234
02:02:06,109 --> 02:02:08,737
对
Right.

1235
02:02:26,046 --> 02:02:28,966
你不知道小心开枪吗?
Be careful what I shoot at?

1236
02:02:37,224 --> 02:02:41,311
-鱼雷保险解除了  - 声纳  红十月号在哪里?
-Safety ranges set to zero.  -Sonar, give me the bearing for Red October.

1237
02:02:41,478 --> 02:02:47,192
-它在我们后面  -右满舵  我要打败他
-She's taking positioned behind us.  -Right full rudder. I'll shake the man loose.

1238
02:02:53,407 --> 02:02:57,077
-它在下潜  -俯倾30度
-He's going deep.  -30 degree down angle.

1239
02:02:57,244 --> 02:02:59,913
反鱼雷在那边? 很好
All the countermeasures were over there, right? Very well.

1240
02:03:25,355 --> 02:03:29,401
司令  雅夫级潜艇太快  他们逃不掉的
Admiral, the alfa's too quick. It's only a matter of time on search.

1241
02:03:29,568 --> 02:03:34,656
"瑞恩  这里有很多东西不能中弹..."
"Ryan, some things in here don't react well to bullets..."

1242
02:03:34,823 --> 02:03:38,619
对  我也不能中弹
Yeah, like me. I don't react well to bullets.

1243
02:03:58,221 --> 02:04:01,433
-钟斯  他在哪里?  -距离很近
-Where is he, Jonesy?  -Close, sir.

1244
02:04:03,352 --> 02:04:06,855
-正前方900米  -终于找到了
-900 meters, directly ahead.  -Got him.

1245
02:04:07,022 --> 02:04:10,192
-校准后发射  -距离太近
-Mark bearings and fire.  -We are too close.

1246
02:04:10,359 --> 02:04:15,739
别争论  发射鱼雷
Don't argue with me. Do it now!

1247
02:04:17,240 --> 02:04:20,702
又发射了一颗鱼雷  它随时会爆炸
Another torpedo. It went active the moment it was launched.

1248
02:04:20,869 --> 02:04:25,666
-左满舵  平衡舰首  -鱼雷锁定我们了
-Left full rudder. Ease off on your bow planes.  -I think he's got us.

1249
02:04:35,592 --> 02:04:39,012
达拉斯号  干得漂亮!
Way to go, Dallas!

1250
02:04:42,766 --> 02:04:47,896
鱼雷在五百码外冲过来  你成功了
Torpedo is in acquisition. Range 500 yards and closing. You've done it, Thompson!

1251
02:04:48,063 --> 02:04:52,359
希望这行得通  大副  浮上水面
I hope this works. All right, chief, put us on the roof.

1252
02:04:52,526 --> 02:04:55,988
准备发射反鱼雷  听我命令  五  四...
Countermeasure station, on my mark. 5, 4...

1253
02:04:58,699 --> 02:05:03,829
发射反鱼雷  紧急上浮
Release counter measures. Emergency blow. Full rise.

1254
02:05:11,003 --> 02:05:14,590
500英尺
500 feet.

1255
02:05:14,756 --> 02:05:18,176
快点上浮
Come on, Big D. Fly!

1256
02:05:37,029 --> 02:05:40,699
鱼雷没停下来  它在寻找别的目标
That torpedo is still active. It's searching for another target, now.

1257
02:06:05,933 --> 02:06:11,146
竟然是他X的厨师
A goddamn cook.

1258
02:06:33,961 --> 02:06:37,089
它锁定我们了!
Torpedo is locked on us!

1259
02:06:37,256 --> 02:06:40,050
-雅夫级潜艇离我们多近?  -左后方1000码处
-How close is that Alfa, Jonesy?  -1,000 yards dead astern, going to port.

1260
02:06:40,050 --> 02:06:42,844
-反方向转  -遵命
-Reverse your turn.  -Aye,sir.

1261
02:06:48,308 --> 02:06:52,562
我们冲向敌方  鱼雷跟着我们
We're turning straight at him. Torpedo's still on our tail.

1262
02:06:56,441 --> 02:07:01,238
在适当的时候退开
The hard part about playing chicken is knowing when to flinch.

1263
02:07:06,618 --> 02:07:10,664
距离400码  350码  300码...
Collision in 400 yards, 350, 300...

1264
02:07:10,831 --> 02:07:16,545
-舰长!  -右满舵  俯倾30度
-Captain!  -Right full rudder. 30 degree down angle.

1265
02:07:16,712 --> 02:07:20,173
这次必定很惊险
This one's going to be close.

1266
02:07:23,093 --> 02:07:26,847
你个傲慢的傻瓜  你会害死我们
You arrogant ass, you've killed us.

1267
02:07:55,208 --> 02:07:58,337
我们确定了红十月号的位置
We have ascertained the Red October's final position.

1268
02:07:58,964 --> 02:08:01,924
但爆炸碎片
But...given the depth of the water and the spread of...

1269
02:08:01,924 --> 02:08:04,885
遍布深海
the wreckage spreads across a wide area...

1270
02:08:05,052 --> 02:08:07,971
我们要花一段时间调查
it'll be some time before anything's recovered.

1271
02:08:08,138 --> 02:08:10,953
你们的人正在
However, your people are interviewing...

1272
02:08:10,953 --> 02:08:13,769
安排船员回国
the crew now and making arrangements for their return.

1273
02:08:13,936 --> 02:08:18,273
这是一场悲惨的意外  大使先生
This has been a terrible tragedy, Mr. Ambassador.

1274
02:08:18,440 --> 02:08:23,695
如果早点找我们  悲剧可能不会发生
And I can only stress hat if you'd come to us earlier, it might have been avoided.

1275
02:08:24,780 --> 02:08:30,702
-我欣赏你坦诚的性格  -彼此彼此
-I appreciate your candor in the matter.  -And I yours, Andrei.

1276
02:08:33,455 --> 02:08:36,291
可能在将来
Perhaps in the future...

1277
02:08:36,291 --> 02:08:39,127
会有更先进的科技来研究潜艇残骸
the technology will be available for an investigation of the wreckage.

1278
02:08:39,294 --> 02:08:43,173
也许吧
Perhaps.

1279
02:08:47,469 --> 02:08:53,850
-还有一件事  我难以启齿...  -请说
-There is another matter, one that I'm reluctant to...  -Please.

1280
02:08:55,352 --> 02:09:02,442
一艘雅夫级潜艇  曾经在大浅滩出没
One of our submarines, an Alfa, was last reported in the area of the Grand Banks.

1281
02:09:02,609 --> 02:09:06,863
它跟我们失去联络
We've not heard from her for some time.

1282
02:09:08,156 --> 02:09:12,703
又一艘潜艇失踪?
Andrei. You've lost another submarine?

1283
02:09:20,103 --> 02:09:24,503
缅因州  佩诺布斯科特河

1284
02:09:27,092 --> 02:09:31,597
长途跋涉来  把潜艇藏在河里
All this way to hide a submarine in a river.

1285
02:09:32,806 --> 02:09:35,871
这儿距离海军基地一百英里
We're 100 miles from the nearest naval base...

1286
02:09:35,871 --> 02:09:38,937
而且卫星不会再窥探这地方
for the last place that satellites will ever look.

1287
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:44,318
我在这里长大
I grew up around here.

1288
02:09:44,484 --> 02:09:49,823
祖父在那个岛教我钓鱼
My grandfather taught me to fish off that island over there.

1289
02:09:52,868 --> 02:09:59,833
你心里还有一个疑问  为什么不问?
There is one question you haven't asked me yet. Why?

1290
02:10:01,627 --> 02:10:04,963
在适当的时候  你自然会说出来
Well, I figured you would tell me when you were ready.

1291
02:10:07,883 --> 02:10:12,512
有人说  我们要主动攻打美国
Now, there are those who believe we should attack the United States first.

1292
02:10:12,679 --> 02:10:19,186
了却一切恩怨  红十月号就是为此而建造的
Settle everything in one moment. Red October was built for that purpose.

1293
02:10:19,353 --> 02:10:24,900
-然后  莫斯科会付出沉重的代价  -也许吧
-When the dust settles from this, there's going to be hell to pay in Moscow.

1294
02:10:25,067 --> 02:10:28,278
那可能是好事
Maybe some good will come from it.

1295
02:10:28,445 --> 02:10:34,117
一场小革命能整顿国家  你觉得呢?
A little revolution now and then is a healthy thing, do you think?

1296
02:10:39,915 --> 02:10:43,710
-你仍然喜欢钓鱼吗  瑞恩?  -是的
-Do you still like to fish, Ryan?  -Mmm.

1297
02:10:45,128 --> 02:10:49,049
维尔纳斯有一条河  跟这里差不多
There's a river, not unlike this one, near Vilnius...

1298
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:53,887
我祖父在那里教我钓鱼
where my grandfather taught me to fish.

1299
02:10:54,930 --> 02:10:59,685
"大海为每个人带来新希望"
"And the sea will grant each man new hope."

1300
02:10:59,851 --> 02:11:03,563
"正如睡眠带来梦境"
"As sleep brings dreams."

1301
02:11:09,611 --> 02:11:12,322
克里斯托弗  哥伦布
Christopher Columbus.

1302
02:11:16,201 --> 02:11:19,580
欢迎光临新世界  舰长
Welcome to the new world, sir.

1303
02:11:20,305 --> 02:12:20,661
