1
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,680
It's cold this morning, Captain.

2
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,399
Cold.

3
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:00,537
And hard.

4
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,723
It's time, captain.

5
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,728
It's time.

6
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:29,316
Time indeed.

113
00:14:04,928 --> 00:14:07,014
Time to open the orders, sir.

114
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:12,769
The Political Officer is in your cabin.

115
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:14,938
Very well.

116
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,733
You have the conn.

117
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,004
What are you doing?

118
00:14:39,171 --> 00:14:44,384
I must oversee the stability of the crew, Captain.

119
00:14:45,969 --> 00:14:49,306
By invading my privacy?

120
00:14:50,098 --> 00:14:55,354
Privacy is not a major concern
in the Soviet Union, comrade.

121
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:59,024
It's often contrary to the collective good.

122
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:07,908
"Behold, I am coming as a thief...

123
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:11,286
"And they gathered them together

124
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:16,667
"In a place called...

125
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,335
"Armageddon. "

1318
01:52:55,484 --> 01:52:57,027
He's turning green.

1319
01:53:19,883 --> 01:53:22,010
What's so funny?

1320
01:53:23,512 --> 01:53:27,307
The captain seems to think
you're some sort of cowboy.

1321
01:53:28,684 --> 01:53:30,060
You speak Russian.

1322
01:53:31,770 --> 01:53:33,730
A little.

1323
01:53:35,399 --> 01:53:38,861
It's wise to study
the ways of one's adversary.

1324
01:53:38,944 --> 01:53:40,737
Don't you think?


1352
01:55:59,084 --> 01:56:01,128
The Captain is fighting them.

1353
01:56:01,211 --> 01:56:04,965
The Captain is fighting the Americans.
The Captain is fighting the Americans.
