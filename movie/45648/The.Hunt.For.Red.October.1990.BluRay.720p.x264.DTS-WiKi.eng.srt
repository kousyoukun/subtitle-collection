1
00:04:47,727 --> 00:04:51,595
You're supposed
to be upstairs sleeping.

2
00:04:51,765 --> 00:04:57,863
- Stanley keeps waking me up.
- Oh, I get it...

3
00:04:59,005 --> 00:05:02,099
- You're getting heavy.
- No nonsense.

4
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:05,802
Two stories. Two glasses of water.
Jack...

5
00:05:05,979 --> 00:05:12,509
- You're going to miss the plane.
- Go upstairs with Mrs Wheeler.

6
00:05:12,685 --> 00:05:17,452
When I'm on my business trip,
I'll get Stanley a little brother.

7
00:05:17,624 --> 00:05:20,855
- Promise?
- I promise.

8
00:05:54,027 --> 00:05:58,054
- Can I get you anything, sir?
- No, thank you.

9
00:05:58,231 --> 00:06:03,066
If you try and get some sleep,
the flight will go a lot faster.

10
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:06,899
I can never sleep on a plane.
Turbulence.

11
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:10,133
- Pardon?
- Turbulence.

12
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:14,770
Solar radiation heats the earth's crust,
warm air rises, cool air descends.

13
00:06:14,948 --> 00:06:18,941
- I don't like that.
- Try to get some sleep anyway.

14
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:59,483
Dr Ryan?

15
00:07:15,408 --> 00:07:19,367
Jack, get yourself in here.

16
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:22,174
Jesus, you look like hell.

17
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:26,284
Thank you very much, Admiral.
I could use some coffee.

18
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:30,183
I'm not going to ask you
how your flight went.

19
00:07:30,356 --> 00:07:36,625
- When did you last get some sleep?
- I don't know.

20
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:39,890
Milk and sugar.

21
00:07:40,066 --> 00:07:46,062
How's Caroline? Last time I saw her
was at your granddad's place in Maine.

22
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:49,640
She's fine.
She sends you her best.

23
00:07:49,809 --> 00:07:55,372
And Sally?
What is she now, three?

24
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:59,575
No, she's a very precocious five.

25
00:07:59,752 --> 00:08:04,712
She announced the other day
that her life would be less lonely -

26
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:09,089
- if we were to buy her
a baby brother.

27
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:14,029
But she decided it would be enough
if we were to buy one for Stanley.

28
00:08:15,234 --> 00:08:19,933
- Who's Stanley?
- Stanley's a bear.

29
00:08:21,908 --> 00:08:27,175
What's important enough to get you
on a plane in the middle of the night?

30
00:08:27,347 --> 00:08:32,011
British Intelligence obtained
these pictures of the Red October.

31
00:08:32,185 --> 00:08:36,053
- She's the latest Typhoon class.
- Big son of a bitch.

32
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:40,056
12 metres longer than standard.
3 metres wider.

33
00:08:40,226 --> 00:08:44,219
- Captain's name is Ramius.
- One of yours?

34
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:49,926
I did the bio on him last year.
He always takes out their lead boat.

35
00:08:50,103 --> 00:08:55,200
Good political connections.
Trains their attack-boat skippers.

36
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:59,402
The Russians call him
Vilnius nastavnic.

37
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:03,071
The Vilnius schoolmaster.

38
00:09:03,249 --> 00:09:08,084
- What are these doors?
- Those doors are the problem.

39
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:15,558
I don't know what they are, neither
do the British. Perhaps they're new.

40
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:19,289
I'd like to show these to Skip Tyler.

41
00:09:19,465 --> 00:09:23,401
- The sub driver?
- He was until he lost his leg.

42
00:09:23,569 --> 00:09:28,563
Now he teaches at the Academy.
He's got top-secret clearance.

43
00:09:31,077 --> 00:09:35,275
Have the car for Dr Ryan
downstairs in ten minutes.

44
00:09:39,018 --> 00:09:43,114
The satellite caught Red October
in Polijarny Inlet this morning.

45
00:10:24,329 --> 00:10:29,562
- Do you hear it?
- No.

46
00:10:29,735 --> 00:10:35,230
At Cal Tech we used to do this
in our sleep. Do you hear it now?

47
00:10:35,407 --> 00:10:39,707
Wait a minute... maybe.

48
00:10:39,878 --> 00:10:43,211
- It's buried in surface clutter.
- Yes.

49
00:10:43,382 --> 00:10:46,715
- I should go to SAPS?
- Correct, Seaman Beaumont.

50
00:10:46,885 --> 00:10:50,548
Signal Algorithmic
Processing Systems.

51
00:10:50,722 --> 00:10:54,317
Give it a week
and you'll be teaching at Cal Tech.

52
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:59,556
So, like Beethoven on the computer, -

53
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:03,030
- you have laboured to produce...

54
00:11:08,607 --> 00:11:11,440
...a biologic.

55
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:15,638
- A what?
- A whale.

56
00:11:16,648 --> 00:11:21,847
A marine mammal that knows
a lot more about sonar than you do.

57
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:27,219
Kill SAPS.
Go over to 269, and let's try it again.

58
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:33,194
If he gets to bothering you,
ask him about Pavarotti.

59
00:11:33,365 --> 00:11:39,270
I was in the middle of teaching
Beaumont about modern sonar.

60
00:11:39,438 --> 00:11:45,308
- I'm chief of the boat.
- Tell me, Cobb.

61
00:11:45,477 --> 00:11:48,640
Okay, go ahead.

62
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:54,515
Seaman Jones
is into music in a big way.

63
00:11:54,686 --> 00:12:00,420
He figures this whole boat
is his personal, private stereo set.

64
00:12:00,592 --> 00:12:05,359
- He gets this Pavarotti...
- It was Paganini.

65
00:12:05,531 --> 00:12:07,692
This is my story.

66
00:12:07,866 --> 00:12:11,358
Pavarotti is a tenor.
Paganini was a composer.

67
00:12:11,537 --> 00:12:19,444
He's got this music,
and he's listening to it on his head set.

68
00:12:19,611 --> 00:12:24,378
Then all hell breaks loose.
There's a slew of boats at San Diego.

69
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,783
- And one way out at Pearl.
- All of a sudden...

70
00:12:29,955 --> 00:12:34,983
Pavarotti is coming out of their asses.
Jones...

71
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:40,226
- What do I do?
- I got it.

72
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:47,570
New contact bearing 097.
Designate contact Sierra-35.

73
00:12:47,739 --> 00:12:51,800
- What have you got, Jonesy?
- Probably submerged.

74
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:57,916
It could be a missile boat
out of Polijarny.

75
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:04,417
Start your track.
I'll be there in a minute.

76
00:15:18,975 --> 00:15:25,244
'The 7th angel poured forth his bowl,
and a voice cried out from Heaven..."

77
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:29,009
"It is done."

78
00:15:29,185 --> 00:15:34,418
A man with your responsibilities
reading about the end of the world.

79
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:40,927
What's this? "I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

80
00:15:41,097 --> 00:15:45,261
It is an ancient Hindu text
quoted by an American.

81
00:15:45,434 --> 00:15:48,665
- An American?
- He invented the atomic bomb.

82
00:15:48,838 --> 00:15:52,433
He was accused of being a communist.

83
00:15:52,608 --> 00:15:56,203
You wrote and underlined
these passages.

84
00:15:56,379 --> 00:15:59,007
No.

85
00:16:00,716 --> 00:16:04,709
This book belonged to my wife.
I keep it for sentimental value.

86
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:08,084
I'm sorry.
Your wife was a beautiful woman.

87
00:16:08,257 --> 00:16:10,987
Her death was unfortunate.

88
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:16,325
I am only doing my job.
It is my responsibility.

89
00:16:18,401 --> 00:16:21,768
How many KGB agents
are aboard my boat?

90
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:27,739
Your boat? This vessel belongs
to the people of the Soviet Union.

91
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:32,313
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU
has agents aboard, -

92
00:16:32,481 --> 00:16:35,780
- I would be the last to know.

93
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:41,616
I suggest we open our orders.

94
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,817
Certainly, comrade.

95
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:31,563
From Commander Strategic Forces
Red Banner Northern Fleet.

96
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:36,872
We are to proceed north,
to grid square 5490.

97
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:43,610
We're to rendezvous with Konovalov,
Capt. Tupolev'ss boat.

98
00:17:43,786 --> 00:17:50,021
- You know Tupolev?
- I know he was your student.

99
00:17:50,192 --> 00:17:53,923
It's rumoured
he has a place in his heart for you.

100
00:17:54,096 --> 00:17:59,625
There's little room in Tupolev'ss heart
for anyone but Tupolev.

101
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:07,936
We are to make contact and run tests.
Tupolev will hunt our ship.

102
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:11,910
We are to evaluate the readiness
of the caterpillar drive.

103
00:18:12,081 --> 00:18:17,018
We return to Polijarny
on or about the 16th of this month.

104
00:18:17,186 --> 00:18:22,317
This is an historic moment.
I should like to make a request.

105
00:18:22,491 --> 00:18:24,721
Before you proceed...

106
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:29,490
Would you permit me
to post the orders for the crew?

107
00:18:54,957 --> 00:18:58,893
Where I am going, you cannot follow.

108
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:32,922
Dr Petrov, report to my cabin.
There's been a dreadful accident.

109
00:20:17,006 --> 00:20:21,170
There's no cradle underneath it.
Get it over.

110
00:20:21,343 --> 00:20:26,747
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?

111
00:20:30,319 --> 00:20:33,948
Ryan! Who let you in here?

112
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:38,583
Have they got you
playing with models now?

113
00:20:38,761 --> 00:20:44,461
Damn it, Phil!
Tell them to slow down.

114
00:20:45,601 --> 00:20:50,038
It's not a model.
It's a DSRV. A rescue sub.

115
00:20:50,205 --> 00:20:53,106
What are you doing with it?

116
00:20:53,275 --> 00:20:59,373
We're rigging it with a generic
docking collar for other subs.

117
00:20:59,548 --> 00:21:02,779
We can get it anywhere in the world
in 24 hours.

118
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:10,291
- How's your back?
- It's fine. Have you got a minute?

119
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:16,630
It's bigger than a regular Typhoon.
What are these doors?

120
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,529
You don't miss much.

121
00:21:19,702 --> 00:21:23,798
Those are too big
to be torpedo tubes.

122
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:27,966
- Can you launch an ICBM horizontally?
- Why would you want to?

123
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:33,775
They're symmetrical,
right down the long axis of the sub.

124
00:21:33,949 --> 00:21:39,251
- How about a towed sonar array?
- Too close to the screws.

125
00:21:39,488 --> 00:21:42,582
I'll be...

126
00:21:42,758 --> 00:21:45,693
This could be a caterpillar.

127
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:50,992
- A what?
- Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

128
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,430
- Do you follow?
- No.

129
00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:58,005
It's like a jet engine for the water.

130
00:21:58,173 --> 00:22:03,042
It's got no moving parts,
so it's very, very quiet.

131
00:22:03,212 --> 00:22:08,445
- How quiet?
- Sonar wouldn't pick it up.

132
00:22:08,617 --> 00:22:14,886
Maybe as a seismic anomaly.
It wouldn't sound like a submarine.

133
00:22:15,057 --> 00:22:21,963
We messed with this a few years ago.
Couldn't make it work.

134
00:22:22,131 --> 00:22:27,626
- They really built this?
- She put to sea this morning.

135
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:38,004
When I was twelve I helped my daddy
build a bomb shelter in our basement, -

136
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:44,278
- because some fool parked a dozen
warheads off the coast of Florida.

137
00:22:44,453 --> 00:22:48,753
This thing could park 200 warheads
off Washington or New York -

138
00:22:48,924 --> 00:22:55,090
- and no one would know anything
about it until it was all over.

139
00:23:04,707 --> 00:23:08,040
- Are you all right, Captain?
- Yes.

140
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:12,738
It's just, to die from something
as petty as slipping on tea...

141
00:23:12,915 --> 00:23:17,318
It was an accident.
You'll feel better when we put in.

142
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:20,944
- Put in?
- Return to base.

143
00:23:21,123 --> 00:23:26,459
- We have no political officer.
- This is a Soviet combat vessel.

144
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:34,125
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.

145
00:23:34,303 --> 00:23:39,900
Seaman, come here.
Come here.

146
00:23:40,909 --> 00:23:45,346
- Your name?
- Cook's Assistant Loginov.

147
00:23:45,514 --> 00:23:49,348
I want you and the doctor
to witness this.

148
00:23:49,518 --> 00:23:56,082
I'm removing the Political Officer's
missile key and keeping it myself.

149
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:59,921
We should report this
to Red Fleet Command.

150
00:24:00,062 --> 00:24:05,625
That's impossible.
Our orders are for radio silence.

151
00:24:05,801 --> 00:24:11,262
- That's all, Loginov.
- This is most unnerving.

152
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:19,142
The reason for having two missile keys
is so that no one man may...

153
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:24,411
- May what?
- May arm the missiles.

154
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:28,818
- Perhaps I should keep the key.
- That'll be all, Doctor.

155
00:24:28,991 --> 00:24:34,657
When I address the crew,
then you will understand.

156
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,997
Petrov, I will try to forget your
comments when I present my report.

157
00:24:45,174 --> 00:24:48,337
Thank you, sir.

158
00:24:52,281 --> 00:24:59,119
Holding steady on 310.
12 knots at about 20,000 yards.

159
00:24:59,288 --> 00:25:04,248
- Have you got a make on it?
- The computer is chewing on it.

160
00:25:04,426 --> 00:25:07,725
It sounds like a Typhoon.

161
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:23,976
- Did I miss something on the boards?
- Sub plant hasn't said anything.

162
00:25:26,815 --> 00:25:31,218
- How many Typhoons are listed?
- Six.

163
00:25:31,386 --> 00:25:37,484
Call this guy Typhoon 7.
Work in a little closer.

164
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:45,590
- Won't he hear us?
- Not if we stay in his baffles.

165
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:49,635
Come in behind his propeller
and he's deaf as a post.

166
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:24,562
- Any sonar contacts?
- No, the sonar is clear.

167
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,074
- Do we have any surface contacts?
- No, the scope is clear.

168
00:26:29,244 --> 00:26:33,704
Good. Then it's time I explain
our orders to the crew.

169
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:38,146
Comrades, this is your captain.

170
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,448
It is an honour to speak to you -

171
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:46,583
- while sailing in our motherland's
most recent achievement.

172
00:26:46,828 --> 00:26:51,765
Once more,
we play our dangerous game.

173
00:26:51,934 --> 00:26:57,736
A game of chess, against our old
adversary, the American Navy.

174
00:26:57,906 --> 00:27:05,039
For 40 years, your fathers before you,
you played this game well.

175
00:27:05,213 --> 00:27:10,651
But today the game is different.
We have the advantage.

176
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:14,915
It reminds me of the heady days
of Sputnik and Yuri Gagarin.

177
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:18,526
The world trembled
at the sound of our rockets.

178
00:27:18,694 --> 00:27:22,186
It will tremble again
at the sound of our silence.

179
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:26,425
The order is: Engage the silent drive.

180
00:27:26,601 --> 00:27:30,435
Ballast control, open outer doors.

181
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:33,904
Engage caterpillar
and secure main engines.

182
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:40,739
Doors opening.

183
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:44,852
Our own fleet doesn't know
our full potential.

184
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:47,887
They will test us.

185
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:53,119
But they will embarrass themselves.
We'll leave our fleet behind.

186
00:27:53,295 --> 00:27:57,789
We will pass through
the American patrols.

187
00:27:57,966 --> 00:28:02,994
We'll lay off their largest city
and listen to their rock and roll, -

188
00:28:03,171 --> 00:28:06,265
- while we conduct missile drills.

189
00:28:08,744 --> 00:28:13,545
When we are finished, the only
sound they will hear is our laughter.

190
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:20,382
Then we will sail to Havana
for sunshine and comradeship.

191
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:28,052
- Cryogenic plant coming on line.
- A great day. We sail into history.

192
00:28:35,003 --> 00:28:38,439
Caterpillar engaging.

193
00:28:39,541 --> 00:28:41,839
Caterpillar engaging.

194
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:58,950
- What happened?
- I don't know.

195
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:28,378
Full rudder left.

196
00:29:28,557 --> 00:29:32,584
Navigator, new course: 250.

197
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:35,958
Course: 250.

198
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:12,796
Sonar contact. Port quarter.

199
00:30:12,968 --> 00:30:17,166
- American, Los Angeles class.
- American!

200
00:30:17,339 --> 00:30:20,638
Course: 310.

201
00:30:20,809 --> 00:30:28,215
- Is the American turning to follow us?
- No, he is continuing on his course.

202
00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:32,649
- He is continuing north-west.
- He can't hear us.

203
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:36,154
And the singing?

204
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:51,969
Let them sing.

205
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:13,750
What are you talking about?
Check again.

206
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:23,660
The sonar is working.
The Russian disappeared.

207
00:31:23,838 --> 00:31:28,241
One minute he was steady,
then he was gone.

208
00:31:29,511 --> 00:31:34,505
- And I thought I heard...
- Heard what?

209
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:38,983
I thought I heard singing, sir.

210
00:31:39,154 --> 00:31:42,851
- Singing?
- Yes, sir.

211
00:31:54,269 --> 00:31:57,432
Good morning, sir.

212
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,409
Good morning, sir.

213
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:06,076
Good morning, sir.

214
00:32:09,784 --> 00:32:14,153
Good morning, sir.
I hope you had a lovely evening.

215
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:17,723
A little chilly this morning.

216
00:32:40,515 --> 00:32:45,282
There's a letter from Marko Ramius.

217
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:47,819
Marko!

218
00:33:18,987 --> 00:33:21,080
Yes?

219
00:33:21,256 --> 00:33:24,919
No, this is Dr Ryan.

220
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:31,147
- What happened?
- This is no longer research.

221
00:33:36,121 --> 00:33:41,821
I got a line on those doors.
You know what they are?

222
00:33:44,697 --> 00:33:49,862
- A silent propulsion system.
- How did you know that?

223
00:33:50,035 --> 00:33:55,132
The sub captain radioed in. The thing
disappeared right in front of him.

224
00:33:55,307 --> 00:33:58,037
That's only the half of it.

225
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:11,322
- You got your ID?
- This is unbelievable.

226
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:16,086
The Kirov, the Kiev, the Minsk.

227
00:34:16,261 --> 00:34:19,287
- Their whole fleet.
- That's right.

228
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:33,435
The President's Security Advisor.
Most of the Joint Chiefs will be there.

229
00:34:33,612 --> 00:34:37,844
- Who is giving the briefing?
- You are.

230
00:34:38,017 --> 00:34:43,284
All the slides are laid out for you.
All you've got to do...

231
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:53,788
Look, no one understands
this material better than you.

232
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:57,925
Give him a run down of the sub
and the stuff in your hand.

233
00:34:58,103 --> 00:35:02,437
When he asks direct questions,
give him direct answers.

234
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:06,544
Tell him what you think. Come on.

235
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:19,114
The last 24 hours have seen some
extraordinary Soviet naval activity.

236
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:23,159
The first ship to sail
was the Red October, -

237
00:35:23,328 --> 00:35:26,923
- in reference
to the October revolution of 1917.

238
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:30,728
A variant of the Typhoon class,
she's 650 feet long -

239
00:35:30,903 --> 00:35:36,341
- and 32,000 tons
submerged displacement.

240
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:44,672
We believe that these doors
enclose a unique propulsion system.

241
00:35:44,850 --> 00:35:48,342
A magneto-hydrodynamic drive,
or caterpillar, -

242
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,388
- that would enable the sub
to run virtually silent.

243
00:35:52,558 --> 00:35:58,190
It is possible that this new drive system
allowed Capt. Ramius...

244
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:01,298
Do we have his picture available?

245
00:36:01,467 --> 00:36:07,372
...to elude our attack boat Dallas,
which was trailing Red October.

246
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:14,045
It is also possible
that this drive system -

247
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:19,241
- could render the Red October
undetectable to our warning nets.

248
00:36:19,418 --> 00:36:24,617
Would you characterise this
as a first-strike weapon?

249
00:36:27,192 --> 00:36:30,025
That is a possibility.

250
00:36:30,195 --> 00:36:36,828
It is designed to approach by stealth
and armed with nuclear warheads.

251
00:36:38,003 --> 00:36:43,407
- Damn thing was made to start a war.
- Proceed, Mr Ryan.

252
00:36:43,575 --> 00:36:47,341
After the Dallas lost contact,
there were additional sailings.

253
00:36:47,513 --> 00:36:53,247
From Polijarny, Leningrad
and from the Mediterranean.

254
00:36:53,418 --> 00:36:58,515
There are now some 58 nuclear subs
headed at high speed into the Atlantic.

255
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:03,684
This afternoon's satellite pass
over Polijarny found heat blooms -

256
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:09,061
- indicating that the Kirov, the Minsk
and 20 other ships were ready to sail.

257
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:14,228
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.

258
00:37:14,406 --> 00:37:18,740
The data supports
no conclusions as yet.

259
00:37:18,911 --> 00:37:26,784
Absence of activity in the Pacific
suggests that this is just an exercise.

260
00:37:26,952 --> 00:37:30,979
Suppose this is a move against NATO?

261
00:37:31,156 --> 00:37:38,255
I have some very sensitive information.
It must not leave this room.

262
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,890
Before sailing, Ramius sent a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin.

263
00:37:43,068 --> 00:37:46,629
He's chairman of
the Red Fleet Northern Directorate.

264
00:37:46,805 --> 00:37:51,242
That's her uncle, Ramius' wife.

265
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,573
Padorin is her uncle.

266
00:37:54,746 --> 00:38:01,709
Padorin immediately demanded
a meeting with Premier Chenyenko.

267
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:08,019
Within minutes of that meeting,
orders were given to find Red October-

268
00:38:08,193 --> 00:38:10,787
- and sink her.

269
00:38:11,864 --> 00:38:16,233
- Sink her?
- They've got a madman on their hands.

270
00:38:16,401 --> 00:38:21,532
Within 500 miles off the coast,
we'll have only two minutes' warning.

271
00:38:36,054 --> 00:38:40,787
- Today's the 23rd, isn't it?
- Yeah.

272
00:38:51,737 --> 00:38:55,229
You son of a bitch.

273
00:38:55,407 --> 00:38:58,968
You son of a bitch!

274
00:39:00,879 --> 00:39:05,976
Do you wish to add something
to our discussion, Dr Ryan?

275
00:39:10,322 --> 00:39:16,352
Well, perhaps there's another
possibility we might consider.

276
00:39:16,528 --> 00:39:20,157
Ramius might be trying to defect.

277
00:39:20,332 --> 00:39:23,597
- Do you mean to suggest?
- Proceed.

278
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:31,933
Ramius trained
most of their officer corps.

279
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:36,570
He could select men
willing to help him.

280
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:40,184
He's not Russian.
He's Lithuanian.

281
00:39:40,352 --> 00:39:44,186
He was raised by his grandfather.

282
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:48,884
He has no children.
No ties to leave behind.

283
00:39:50,462 --> 00:39:55,058
Today is the first anniversary
of his wife's death.

284
00:39:55,233 --> 00:40:01,365
- Come on. You're just an analyst.
- I know Ramius.

285
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:06,204
He's a legend among his men.
He's always been a maverick.

286
00:40:06,378 --> 00:40:11,042
I met him at an embassy dinner.
Have you met Capt. Ramius, General?

287
00:40:19,992 --> 00:40:27,125
How long before Ramius could be
in a position to fire his missiles at us?

288
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:32,168
- Four days.
- All right, I'll brief the President.

289
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:38,106
Dr Ryan, would you stay
for a moment, please?

290
00:40:38,276 --> 00:40:42,474
I said speak your mind, Jack,
but Jesus!

291
00:40:54,259 --> 00:40:57,524
You slammed the door on the general.

292
00:40:57,696 --> 00:41:01,188
- That was not my intention.
- Yes, it was.

293
00:41:01,366 --> 00:41:06,963
He was patronising you.
In my opinion he deserved it.

294
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:12,236
I'm a politician,
which means I'm a cheat and a liar.

295
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:15,938
When I'm not kissing babies,
I'm stealing their lollipops.

296
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:21,108
But it also means
that I keep my options open.

297
00:41:21,286 --> 00:41:26,883
Let's assume for a minute
that you're right, -

298
00:41:27,059 --> 00:41:33,658
- and this Russian intends to defect.
What do you suggest we do about it?

299
00:41:35,834 --> 00:41:39,634
- We definitely grab the boat.
- Wait a minute.

300
00:41:39,805 --> 00:41:43,070
This is not a stray pilot with a MiG.

301
00:41:43,241 --> 00:41:48,178
We're talking about several billion
dollars worth of Soviet property.

302
00:41:48,346 --> 00:41:53,306
- They're going to want it back.
- We could inspect it.

303
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:57,581
Call it a Coastguard safety inspection.

304
00:41:57,756 --> 00:42:01,055
How do we proceed?

305
00:42:01,226 --> 00:42:05,026
We need to contact the commanders
in the Atlantic directly.

306
00:42:05,197 --> 00:42:09,759
If the Russians get one whiff of this,
the game is up.

307
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:12,961
We need to be able to help them.

308
00:42:13,138 --> 00:42:17,768
We need to be ready to go
at a moment's notice.

309
00:42:17,943 --> 00:42:23,438
And somebody has to find out
what Ramius' intentions really are.

310
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,584
Okay, when do you leave?

311
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,653
Wait a minute!

312
00:42:31,823 --> 00:42:35,919
The general was right.
I am only an analyst.

313
00:42:36,094 --> 00:42:39,222
You're perfect.
I can't ask any of these characters.

314
00:42:39,397 --> 00:42:42,958
They wouldn't stake their reputations
on a hunch.

315
00:42:43,135 --> 00:42:46,502
- You...
- Are expendable.

316
00:42:48,406 --> 00:42:51,569
Something like that.

317
00:42:53,812 --> 00:42:57,270
I'll give you three days.

318
00:42:57,449 --> 00:43:03,945
After that, I have to hunt down Ramius
and destroy him. Will you do it?

319
00:43:20,438 --> 00:43:22,565
Mother of God!

320
00:43:22,741 --> 00:43:29,237
Secure the masts. All ahead two thirds.
Set depth to 900 metres.

321
00:43:32,784 --> 00:43:36,550
Come left, heading 205.

322
00:43:51,269 --> 00:43:58,038
These orders
are seven bloody hours old!

323
00:43:58,210 --> 00:44:01,771
- Captain?
- All ahead flank.

324
00:44:01,947 --> 00:44:07,112
Inquire of the engineer about
going to 105% on the reactor.

325
00:44:07,285 --> 00:44:13,190
Seven hours!
The entire fleet is after him.

326
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:23,660
900 metres.

327
00:44:23,835 --> 00:44:30,468
105% on the reactor is possible...
but not recommended.

328
00:44:41,052 --> 00:44:44,180
Go to 105 on the reactor.

329
00:44:46,524 --> 00:44:52,588
- What is it? Where are we going?
- We're going to kill a friend.

330
00:44:53,498 --> 00:44:57,127
We're going to kill Ramius.

331
00:45:17,188 --> 00:45:21,784
If you like borscht perhaps,
but I've eaten better in the galley.

332
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:27,262
My wife asked the waiter
if the chef was from Afghanistan.

333
00:45:27,432 --> 00:45:31,835
Then we went on to the ballet,
to see the new girl as Giselle.

334
00:45:32,003 --> 00:45:36,497
Remember how beautiful she was?
She just married a factory manager...

335
00:45:36,675 --> 00:45:43,274
Doctor, do you have the figures
for the last batch of radiation tests?

336
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:45,814
Now?

337
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:49,147
Now.

338
00:45:49,321 --> 00:45:55,123
Bring the preceding set as well,
for comparison.

339
00:45:55,293 --> 00:45:58,091
Thank you, Doctor.

340
00:46:14,779 --> 00:46:18,078
It will take him some time.

341
00:46:19,284 --> 00:46:24,153
Before we begin, I'd like to know
what happened to Putin.

342
00:46:30,028 --> 00:46:36,331
- He didn't slip on his tea, did he?
- I don't think I like your tone.

343
00:46:36,501 --> 00:46:43,703
- We're risking our lives here.
- Putin could have made complications.

344
00:46:43,875 --> 00:46:47,936
Did you think
he would go away and sulk?

345
00:46:48,113 --> 00:46:54,677
- Are you saying he was murdered?
- Stop whining, Yuri.

346
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:58,721
So he was murdered.
The man was a pig.

347
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:02,986
But it is a decision
we should have all made together.

348
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:08,224
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.

349
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:14,396
Everything that happens on this ship
affects us all.

350
00:47:14,572 --> 00:47:20,306
- Why don't we go back?
- There'll be no going back.

351
00:47:20,478 --> 00:47:26,178
Before we sailed I dispatched a letter
to Admiral Padorin, -

352
00:47:26,351 --> 00:47:30,754
- in which I announced
our intention to defect.

353
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,926
In the name of God, why?

354
00:47:36,094 --> 00:47:40,758
When he reached the new world,
Cortez burned his ships.

355
00:47:40,932 --> 00:47:46,427
- Thus, his men were well motivated.
- You have signed our death warrants.

356
00:47:46,604 --> 00:47:52,270
- Padorin will send the entire fleet.
- Jesus! They'll find us.

357
00:47:52,444 --> 00:47:57,108
Nobody is going to find us.
That's enough, Yuri.

358
00:47:57,282 --> 00:48:02,720
You couldn't just
turn the sub over to the Americans.

359
00:48:02,887 --> 00:48:06,618
You had to make a political statement.

360
00:48:06,791 --> 00:48:13,492
Or was it something deeper that
made you unable to simply slip away?

361
00:48:13,665 --> 00:48:20,161
- Was it ego, Captain?
- We each have our reasons, Victor.

362
00:48:20,338 --> 00:48:24,968
My own began the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship.

363
00:48:25,143 --> 00:48:29,773
A ship which had but one use.
As for the rest, -

364
00:48:29,948 --> 00:48:34,476
- those are things that I alone
must carry the burden for.

365
00:48:35,687 --> 00:48:41,455
Anatoly, you're afraid of our fleet.
You should be.

366
00:48:41,626 --> 00:48:46,620
Personally, I give us...
one chance in three.

367
00:48:49,968 --> 00:48:53,961
More tea, anyone?

368
00:48:55,206 --> 00:48:58,039
No?

369
00:48:58,209 --> 00:49:01,474
Then you may
report back to your posts.

370
00:49:17,729 --> 00:49:21,290
You heard the captain, dismissed.

371
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,233
Captain.

372
00:49:43,488 --> 00:49:49,154
I would never disagree with you
in front of the men.

373
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:53,024
But in this case Victor was right.

374
00:49:53,197 --> 00:49:58,157
It would have been better
if you had not informed Moscow.

375
00:49:58,336 --> 00:50:03,899
Moscow is not the worry,
nor the whole Soviet Navy.

376
00:50:04,075 --> 00:50:09,707
I know their tactics.
I have the advantage.

377
00:50:12,417 --> 00:50:16,319
The worry is the Americans.

378
00:50:16,487 --> 00:50:21,754
If we meet the right sort,
this will work.

379
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:28,491
If we get some buckaroo...

380
00:50:32,370 --> 00:50:37,171
Some turbulence.
You don't like flying?

381
00:50:37,342 --> 00:50:41,540
This is nothing. You should
have been here five months ago.

382
00:50:41,713 --> 00:50:46,446
Talk about puke! We ran into
a hail storm over the Sea of Japan.

383
00:50:46,618 --> 00:50:51,146
The pilot shot his lunch
all over the windshield.

384
00:50:51,322 --> 00:50:53,984
I barfed on the radio.

385
00:50:54,158 --> 00:51:00,097
It wasn't that lightweight stuff.
It was that chunky industrial puke.

386
00:51:00,231 --> 00:51:03,632
You want a bite?

387
00:51:03,801 --> 00:51:07,134
Next time I get a bright idea,
I'll put it in a memo.

388
00:51:16,614 --> 00:51:21,278
- Sir.
- That will be all, Lieutenant.

389
00:51:21,452 --> 00:51:26,412
- Did that Hawkeye trap?
- Number four wire.

390
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:30,789
- Not bad considering.
- The gentleman is here to see you.

391
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:34,056
What the hell are you talking about?

392
00:51:34,232 --> 00:51:39,135
I apologise for the uniform. It's
Admiral Greer's idea of a low profile.

393
00:51:39,303 --> 00:51:45,867
If you're working for Jim Greer,
you can tell me what this is all about.

394
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:53,516
Captain, have you got a minute?
Here's something you ought to see.

395
00:51:54,819 --> 00:52:00,086
Get yourself a cup of coffee.
I'll have some tea.

396
00:52:00,191 --> 00:52:03,456
Get the captain a cup of tea.

397
00:52:05,229 --> 00:52:12,795
The moment that sub went silent
and I thought I heard singing...

398
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:19,739
I heard something in the background,
too, and I managed to get it on tape.

399
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:24,871
I washed it through the computer
and managed to isolate this sound.

400
00:52:27,985 --> 00:52:33,048
The computer identified it
as magma displacement.

401
00:52:33,224 --> 00:52:38,252
The SAPS software was originally
written to look for seismic events.

402
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:42,263
When it gets confused,
it runs home to momma.

403
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:45,425
- I'm not following you.
- I'm sorry.

404
00:52:45,603 --> 00:52:48,595
Listen to it at ten times speed.

405
00:52:56,347 --> 00:53:00,408
That's got to be man-made.

406
00:53:02,787 --> 00:53:07,121
The first contact was at 09:15
and the bearing was 269.

407
00:53:07,291 --> 00:53:12,593
At 09:30, it was here.
At 11 and 11:15, it was here and here.

408
00:53:12,764 --> 00:53:18,532
Russian subs have been reported
running Reykjanes Ridge at high speed.

409
00:53:18,703 --> 00:53:22,139
- They had hyper-accurate maps.
- Yeah, Red Route One.

410
00:53:22,306 --> 00:53:27,141
The front door to those canyons
was a location called Thor's Twins.

411
00:53:27,311 --> 00:53:29,643
Look...

412
00:53:44,428 --> 00:53:47,124
Right into Red Route One.

413
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:54,727
You may think I'm crazy, but I'll bet
we found some new Russian sub.

414
00:53:54,906 --> 00:53:58,967
It's now headed for the Iceland coast.

415
00:53:59,143 --> 00:54:05,605
A $40 million computer tells you
you're chasing an earthquake, -

416
00:54:05,783 --> 00:54:11,119
- but you don't believe it. And you
come up with this on your own.

417
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:17,285
- Yes, sir.
- Relax, you've sold me.

418
00:54:17,461 --> 00:54:25,197
Plot us a course for the bottom end
of Red Route One.

419
00:54:25,369 --> 00:54:31,103
We'll never find him in those canyons.
But first we'd better phone in.

420
00:54:31,275 --> 00:54:34,142
Aye, aye, Captain.

421
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,080
Hang on, Jonesy.

422
00:54:48,459 --> 00:54:52,725
If I can get you close enough,
can you track this sucker?

423
00:54:52,897 --> 00:54:58,927
Now that I know what to listen for...
I'll bag him.

424
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:04,166
- Carry on.
- Yes, sir.

425
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:10,941
That's the craziest notion ever!
An entire nuclear submarine?

426
00:55:11,115 --> 00:55:15,449
They can't all want to defect,
even if it's only the officers.

427
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,181
- What's his plan?
- His plan?

428
00:55:19,357 --> 00:55:22,793
Russians don't take a dump
without a plan.

429
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,488
Senior captains are sure
to have thought the matter through.

430
00:55:27,665 --> 00:55:32,125
- He's just going to sail into New York?
- It might be that simple.

431
00:55:32,303 --> 00:55:35,033
Things might be simple at CIA.

432
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:40,303
But in the middle of the North Atlantic
they get a bit more complex.

433
00:55:40,478 --> 00:55:44,346
- Smoke?
- No, thank you.

434
00:55:44,515 --> 00:55:48,611
And you'd need more
than a few days' inspection.

435
00:55:48,786 --> 00:55:53,189
In order to be any value,
you'd have to tear it apart.

436
00:55:53,357 --> 00:55:58,659
- Then we have to keep it.
- What will you do with the crew?

437
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:02,492
They'd know we got the boat.

438
00:56:02,667 --> 00:56:08,970
- Or do you plan to eliminate them?
- We're not at war, sir.

439
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:14,601
So we have to do this in such a way
that they think we don't have the boat.

440
00:56:14,779 --> 00:56:18,613
They'll go back
and report that we don't have it.

441
00:56:18,783 --> 00:56:23,948
Otherwise this whole business
is just academic, right?

442
00:56:24,121 --> 00:56:26,681
Yes, I see your point.

443
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:34,120
- When was the last time you slept?
- A while.

444
00:56:35,333 --> 00:56:39,463
- The chief outside will fix you up.
- Thank you, sir.

445
00:56:39,637 --> 00:56:42,037
Captain.

446
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:49,769
It'll be dawn soon. We'll be in the CIC.

447
00:56:49,947 --> 00:56:55,112
Things are liable to get
a little dicey around here.

448
00:57:04,228 --> 00:57:07,493
- You think he's crazy.
- Certifiable.

449
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:11,863
And I don't care for him
wearing the uniform.

450
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:17,975
Did you see that ring on his finger?
The Academy class of '72. A Marine.

451
00:57:18,142 --> 00:57:24,877
In the summer of his third year,
he went down in a chopper accident.

452
00:57:25,049 --> 00:57:31,887
He spent ten months in traction
and another year learning to walk.

453
00:57:33,257 --> 00:57:37,091
He did his fourth year
from the hospital.

454
00:57:37,261 --> 00:57:42,722
It's up to you, Charlie, but you might
consider cutting him a little slack.

455
00:57:44,969 --> 00:57:49,406
The Russians will find that sub
before we get near it anyway.

456
00:58:10,327 --> 00:58:14,730
- Passing Thor's Twins, sir.
- Very good.

457
00:58:19,103 --> 00:58:23,403
- Passing the Twins now, sir.
- Commence your run.

458
00:58:23,574 --> 00:58:26,771
Call me when you get to the first turn.

459
00:58:26,944 --> 00:58:31,040
Mr Kamarov, commence your run.

460
00:58:31,215 --> 00:58:37,484
First leg on my mark.
Course: 260. Speed: 18 knots.

461
00:58:37,655 --> 00:58:40,419
Depth: 270 metres.

462
00:58:40,591 --> 00:58:46,154
Five, four, three, two, one...

463
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,230
Mark.

464
00:58:48,399 --> 00:58:54,201
Diving Command, course: 260.
Speed: 18 knots.

465
00:58:54,371 --> 00:59:01,072
Give me a stopwatch and a map and I'll
fly the Alps in a plane with no windows.

466
00:59:01,245 --> 00:59:04,646
If the map is accurate enough.

467
00:59:25,035 --> 00:59:29,131
We're in the lane
and approaching the first turn.

468
00:59:29,306 --> 00:59:34,209
Come left to course 195
in 30 seconds.

469
00:59:34,378 --> 00:59:39,315
Decrease depth to 200 metres.
Maintain speed.

470
00:59:41,519 --> 00:59:45,615
Captain, we are approaching
the first turn.

471
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:50,556
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.

472
00:59:52,730 --> 00:59:55,665
Aye, Captain.

473
00:59:55,833 --> 00:59:59,735
Navigator, recompute for 26 knots.

474
00:59:59,904 --> 01:00:05,137
Turn on my mark. Five, four, three...

475
01:00:05,309 --> 01:00:08,244
...two, one, mark.

476
01:00:08,412 --> 01:00:13,111
Diving control,
come left to 195. Up on the bow planes.

477
01:00:21,158 --> 01:00:26,653
Course now 195
and maintaining speed 26 knots.

478
01:00:30,935 --> 01:00:35,031
- Mr Kamarov?
- Next leg, Captain.

479
01:00:35,206 --> 01:00:40,872
Come right to 240
at 8 minutes and 40 seconds.

480
01:00:41,045 --> 01:00:44,845
Very good.
Maintain course and speed.

481
01:00:47,751 --> 01:00:51,346
Too fast, Vassily.

482
01:00:51,522 --> 01:00:56,926
Those charts are laid out precisely.
So many knots for so many seconds.

483
01:00:57,094 --> 01:01:02,157
- This thing handles like a pig.
- Watch your bearing, Mr Slavin.

484
01:01:08,138 --> 01:01:12,040
15 seconds to turn.
Should we decrease speed?

485
01:01:12,209 --> 01:01:16,305
Negative. Prepare to come right.

486
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:21,179
Eight, seven, six, five, four...

487
01:01:21,352 --> 01:01:25,083
...three, two, one, mark.

488
01:01:25,256 --> 01:01:30,888
15 degrees on the bow planes.
Come right. 240. Move it!

489
01:01:50,414 --> 01:01:55,442
We're in the lane. Next leg
34 minutes to the Neptune Massif.

490
01:01:55,619 --> 01:01:58,611
Course: 240.

491
01:02:10,734 --> 01:02:14,465
- What happened?
- The cryogenic plant.

492
01:02:14,638 --> 01:02:19,735
The magnets aren't being cooled.
We're 50 degrees above red line.

493
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:24,745
- It's going to melt.
- Kill it, shut it down!

494
01:02:28,485 --> 01:02:34,981
- The cryogenic plant failed.
- Reactor damage?

495
01:02:35,159 --> 01:02:39,755
- The reactor scrammed automatically.
- Was there any core damage?

496
01:02:39,930 --> 01:02:43,297
- Any radiation leakage?
- I don't know yet.

497
01:02:43,467 --> 01:02:49,736
- How long will it take to fix?
- I've got to find out what's wrong first.

498
01:02:51,308 --> 01:02:55,244
We will have to stop
and repair the caterpillar unit.

499
01:02:55,412 --> 01:03:01,749
- We will run on normal propulsion.
- Captain, we will not be silent.

500
01:03:01,919 --> 01:03:07,619
Make revolutions for 20 knots
and engage the propellers.

501
01:03:10,127 --> 01:03:16,430
- Aye, Captain.
- That man will get us all killed.

502
01:03:20,871 --> 01:03:24,204
The captain knows what he's doing.

503
01:03:27,879 --> 01:03:32,111
Naval activities?
I have no knowledge of this.

504
01:03:32,283 --> 01:03:36,583
- But then I never was a sailor.
- Mr Ambassador...

505
01:03:36,754 --> 01:03:41,453
You have nearly 100 naval vessels
operating in the North Atlantic.

506
01:03:41,626 --> 01:03:44,789
You've dropped enough sonar buoys -

507
01:03:44,962 --> 01:03:50,423
- for a man to walk from Greenland
to Scotland without getting his feet wet.

508
01:03:50,601 --> 01:03:55,595
You make your point
as delicately as ever.

509
01:03:55,773 --> 01:04:00,574
What looks like an exercise
could be a prelude to war.

510
01:04:00,745 --> 01:04:05,978
How can we tell the difference?
We have to deploy our ships.

511
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:08,983
Has your government considered -

512
01:04:09,153 --> 01:04:14,921
- that having your ships and ours
in such proximity -

513
01:04:15,092 --> 01:04:21,361
- is inherently dangerous?
Wars have begun that way.

514
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:35,539
- We have lost one of our submarines.
- Lost it?

515
01:04:35,713 --> 01:04:38,773
This is most embarrassing.

516
01:04:38,950 --> 01:04:45,514
Several of the crew, the officers,
are sons of high Party officials.

517
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:51,424
One is even the son
of a Central Committee member.

518
01:04:52,730 --> 01:04:57,758
- This is a massive rescue operation?
- That is correct.

519
01:05:00,805 --> 01:05:04,366
I'm terribly sorry. How can we help?

520
01:05:06,711 --> 01:05:11,307
- I'm not sure that...
- Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

521
01:05:14,652 --> 01:05:17,678
That is very gracious of you.

522
01:05:17,855 --> 01:05:20,824
I will pass your offer on.

523
01:05:20,992 --> 01:05:24,189
But I think we're doing
everything that can be done.

524
01:05:43,948 --> 01:05:46,246
Captain.

525
01:05:48,652 --> 01:05:54,557
Our strategy depends on your answer.
The fleet will know where we are.

526
01:05:54,725 --> 01:05:59,628
Sonar. We have just been overflown
by a low-altitude, multi-engined plane.

527
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:02,357
Put it on audio.

528
01:06:04,935 --> 01:06:10,237
It's closing.
Water entry of small objects.

529
01:06:10,408 --> 01:06:14,435
- Sonar buoys.
- Battle stations.

530
01:06:14,612 --> 01:06:17,740
Battle stations!

531
01:06:17,915 --> 01:06:21,544
How long to Neptune Massif?

532
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:26,281
- How long?
- 4 minutes, 10 seconds.

533
01:06:26,457 --> 01:06:30,553
- Should we bottom the boat?
- It's too late for that now.

534
01:06:30,728 --> 01:06:36,360
We're out of time. Counter measures.
Prepare to launch a full spread.

535
01:06:44,975 --> 01:06:48,103
Request permission to launch.

536
01:06:48,279 --> 01:06:51,214
Launch the weapon.

537
01:06:53,517 --> 01:06:55,610
Weapon is away.

538
01:06:59,457 --> 01:07:03,951
High-speed screw.
Torpedo in the water.

539
01:07:05,663 --> 01:07:09,224
Torpedo is active.

540
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,131
- Torpedo has acquired.
- Launch counter measures.

541
01:07:13,304 --> 01:07:16,000
Aye, sir.

542
01:07:21,245 --> 01:07:26,683
- How long to the turn?
- 2 minutes, 9 seconds.

543
01:07:26,851 --> 01:07:30,184
We've no room to manoeuvre.

544
01:07:30,354 --> 01:07:32,379
Shut up!

545
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:42,390
Torpedo has reached
counter measures and lost contact.

546
01:07:45,169 --> 01:07:51,074
Torpedo has reacquired and is homing.

547
01:07:51,242 --> 01:07:56,703
- Give me the count.
- Turn at Massif in 30 seconds.

548
01:07:56,881 --> 01:08:00,373
- Time to torpedo impact?
- 35 seconds.

549
01:08:00,551 --> 01:08:04,317
- Increase to flank.
- Full-ahead flank.

550
01:08:05,956 --> 01:08:11,394
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.
35 seconds.

551
01:08:18,836 --> 01:08:21,634
30 seconds.

552
01:08:21,805 --> 01:08:25,969
Turn at Massif in seven, six...

553
01:08:26,143 --> 01:08:29,408
...five, four...

554
01:08:29,580 --> 01:08:33,641
...three, two, one, mark.

555
01:08:33,817 --> 01:08:37,844
- Torpedo impact: 25 seconds.
- The turn, Captain.

556
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:45,458
Mark plus eight seconds, nine, ten...

557
01:08:45,629 --> 01:08:52,592
...11 seconds, 12, 13, 14...
plus 15 seconds.

558
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:58,265
- Captain, we're out of position.
- Torpedo impact in 15 seconds.

559
01:08:58,442 --> 01:09:01,605
Sound collision.

560
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:06,273
- We're out of the lane.
- You're relieved.

561
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:17,484
Right full rudder!
Reverse starboard engine!

562
01:09:21,565 --> 01:09:24,625
Torpedo impact: 12 seconds.

563
01:09:24,802 --> 01:09:31,230
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5...

564
01:09:34,445 --> 01:09:39,246
Navigator,
16 degrees off the bow plane.

565
01:10:02,172 --> 01:10:07,542
- They're really shooting at us! Why?
- Easy, boy.

566
01:10:07,711 --> 01:10:14,708
If they were really shooting at us,
we'd be dead by now.

567
01:10:32,536 --> 01:10:36,802
I found out what happened
to the caterpillar.

568
01:10:36,974 --> 01:10:43,402
The buffer circuit has been torn out.
It was only a matter of time.

569
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:50,543
- What are you saying?
- Somebody wanted to cripple the ship.

570
01:10:50,721 --> 01:10:54,054
We have a saboteur on board.

571
01:10:58,128 --> 01:11:05,899
It can't be any of the officers,
it must be a member of the crew.

572
01:11:06,070 --> 01:11:11,098
Go and check Putin's files
for information on the crew.

573
01:11:11,275 --> 01:11:13,607
We may have to put them off
before we planned.

574
01:11:16,213 --> 01:11:20,877
'Your average Russkie
don't take a dump without a plan."

575
01:11:22,619 --> 01:11:25,383
Wait a minute.

576
01:11:25,556 --> 01:11:30,687
He will already have figured out
how to get the crew off the ship.

577
01:11:30,861 --> 01:11:38,666
We just have to figure out
how he's going to do it.

578
01:11:39,937 --> 01:11:43,065
They'd have to want to get off.

579
01:11:44,274 --> 01:11:49,109
How do you get a crew
to want to get off a submarine?

580
01:11:49,279 --> 01:11:53,443
How do you get a crew
to want to get off a nuclear?

581
01:11:53,617 --> 01:11:57,576
- I know how he'll get the crew off.
- Not now, Jack.

582
01:11:57,755 --> 01:12:04,354
Yankee One, declaring an emergency.

583
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:10,364
Yankee One, vector 270.
Speed is buster, over.

584
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:12,934
Say again, Yankee One.

585
01:12:13,103 --> 01:12:18,564
A Bear Foxtrot got too close to the
group. He bumped one of our F-14s.

586
01:12:18,742 --> 01:12:24,203
The plane's damaged.
They're trying to get him back aboard.

587
01:12:24,381 --> 01:12:27,316
Busy morning.

588
01:12:27,484 --> 01:12:32,888
Russian attack subs have taken
up station off every East Coast port.

589
01:12:33,056 --> 01:12:35,547
We're up here.

590
01:12:35,726 --> 01:12:38,820
The New Jersey and her group
are moving up the coast.

591
01:12:38,996 --> 01:12:44,832
The Russians have attack subs
and surface groups here.

592
01:12:45,002 --> 01:12:48,403
- That's a lot of firepower.
- Yes.

593
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:55,068
And there's something else strange.
They're not listening to their sonar.

594
01:12:55,245 --> 01:13:00,547
At 30 knots, they could run over
my daughter's stereo and not hear it.

595
01:13:02,019 --> 01:13:07,047
They're not trying to find Ramius,
they're trying to drive him.

596
01:13:09,793 --> 01:13:13,024
Hounds to the hunters.

597
01:13:13,197 --> 01:13:17,224
Your sub captain
is going to make it to America.

598
01:13:17,401 --> 01:13:20,564
He's going to die within sight of it.

599
01:13:20,737 --> 01:13:25,436
His wingman
requested permission to fire.

600
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:30,774
This could be the biggest naval battle
since Jutland. Jesus!

601
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:35,908
- The water's too cold to eject.
- Try and bring him aboard.

602
01:13:36,086 --> 01:13:39,954
- What's this sub off by herself?
- Bart Mancuso's boat.

603
01:13:40,123 --> 01:13:43,650
He's at the bottom of Red Route One.

604
01:13:43,827 --> 01:13:48,389
He's contacted what his computer calls
magma displacement.

605
01:13:48,565 --> 01:13:52,626
Magma displacement?
Is that like a seismic anomaly?

606
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:58,435
- I suppose so.
- Can you get me on board the Dallas?

607
01:13:58,609 --> 01:14:04,741
- Mancuso found the Red October.
- He hasn't found anything.

608
01:14:04,915 --> 01:14:09,477
This silent propulsion system
could be mistaken for...

609
01:14:09,653 --> 01:14:13,145
The only way to get you out there
is by chopper.

610
01:14:13,323 --> 01:14:18,226
We'd have to strip it down
into a flying gas can.

611
01:14:18,395 --> 01:14:23,423
Yankee One is on final.
Rescue personnel are in place.

612
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:26,296
Pick up your left wing.

613
01:14:26,470 --> 01:14:28,870
Power! Wave off!

614
01:14:29,039 --> 01:14:32,031
Eject!

615
01:14:45,322 --> 01:14:51,056
This business will get out of control
and we'll be lucky to live through it.

616
01:15:03,473 --> 01:15:07,705
There's enough fuel to get you there,
but the Dallas may not be there.

617
01:15:07,878 --> 01:15:13,373
She might have gone deep.
If you have to ditch...

618
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:25,327
If you have to ditch,
get into the survival gear.

619
01:15:25,495 --> 01:15:30,523
At this water temperature,
you'll have about four minutes.

620
01:15:33,870 --> 01:15:37,533
Next time, Jack, write a memo.

621
01:16:10,540 --> 01:16:14,271
- Is the captain sacked out?
- Yeah.

622
01:16:15,445 --> 01:16:19,472
- What about him?
- He won't leave.

623
01:16:28,892 --> 01:16:33,124
You know, I've seen a mermaid once.

624
01:16:33,296 --> 01:16:37,096
I've even seen a shark
eat an octopus.

625
01:16:37,267 --> 01:16:41,636
But I've never seen
a phantom Russian submarine.

626
01:17:20,277 --> 01:17:27,206
We're emerging from the route.
We'll make the first turn shortly.

627
01:17:27,384 --> 01:17:33,482
The caterpillar is operational
and appears to be running normally.

628
01:17:33,657 --> 01:17:39,527
The crew know about the saboteur
and they are afraid.

629
01:17:41,465 --> 01:17:45,401
That could be useful
when the time comes.

630
01:17:47,738 --> 01:17:53,176
We could make the Labrador coast
in 16 hours.

631
01:17:53,343 --> 01:17:56,972
Half of them would freeze
before they were rescued.

632
01:17:57,147 --> 01:18:01,106
It's Massachusetts or Maine
in 48 hours.

633
01:18:01,284 --> 01:18:04,481
Two days.

634
01:18:11,027 --> 01:18:16,090
Do you think they will
let me live in Montana?

635
01:18:21,505 --> 01:18:26,670
I would think they'll let you live
wherever you want.

636
01:18:26,843 --> 01:18:32,179
Good, then I will live in Montana.

637
01:18:32,349 --> 01:18:37,150
I will marry a round American woman
and raise rabbits.

638
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:40,812
And she will cook them for me.

639
01:18:40,991 --> 01:18:44,654
And I will have a pickup truck.

640
01:18:44,828 --> 01:18:51,199
Or possibly even
a recreational vehicle, -

641
01:18:51,368 --> 01:18:55,361
- and drive from state to state.

642
01:18:55,539 --> 01:18:59,635
- Do they let you do that?
- Yes.

643
01:18:59,810 --> 01:19:04,543
- No papers?
- No papers.

644
01:19:04,714 --> 01:19:07,808
Commence your turn.

645
01:19:10,887 --> 01:19:17,053
In winter, I will live in Arizona.

646
01:19:17,227 --> 01:19:22,824
- I think I will need two wives.
- At least.

647
01:19:32,509 --> 01:19:39,244
- Possible aspect change on target.
- Concur, change in bearing rate.

648
01:19:42,853 --> 01:19:47,085
- Crazy lvan!
- All stop. Quiet.

649
01:19:54,598 --> 01:20:01,231
Russian subs turn suddenly when they
want to see if anyone is behind them.

650
01:20:01,404 --> 01:20:04,737
We call it Crazy lvan.

651
01:20:04,908 --> 01:20:10,244
You shut everything down
and make like a hole in the water.

652
01:20:10,413 --> 01:20:17,046
- What's the catch?
- A boat this big doesn't stop on a dime.

653
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:22,681
If we're too close,
we'll drift right into the back of them.

654
01:20:24,861 --> 01:20:28,262
What about you?
What do you look forward to?

655
01:20:37,574 --> 01:20:43,035
I have no such appetites.

656
01:20:43,213 --> 01:20:47,081
Let's see if he can hear us.

657
01:20:51,788 --> 01:20:54,188
There must be something.

658
01:21:02,165 --> 01:21:05,328
What is it?

659
01:21:07,437 --> 01:21:12,067
I miss the peace of fishing.

660
01:21:12,242 --> 01:21:15,939
Like when I was a boy.

661
01:21:17,514 --> 01:21:24,113
40 years I've been at sea.
A war at sea.

662
01:21:26,122 --> 01:21:33,119
A war with no battles.
No monuments.

663
01:21:33,296 --> 01:21:36,732
Only casualties.

664
01:21:40,103 --> 01:21:44,062
I widowed her the day I married her.

665
01:21:47,210 --> 01:21:50,611
My wife died while I was at sea.

666
01:22:09,332 --> 01:22:12,392
Post guards in the engineering spaces.

667
01:22:12,569 --> 01:22:17,404
If he can get to the caterpillar,
he can get to somewhere more vital.

668
01:22:20,477 --> 01:22:26,074
- Where is he Jonesy?
- Target is on our starboard side.

669
01:22:26,249 --> 01:22:30,583
My read is that he's returning
to base course.

670
01:22:30,754 --> 01:22:36,488
- Concur, he's returning to 210.
- He went right around us.

671
01:22:36,659 --> 01:22:41,687
Give him another 30 seconds.
Then secure from silent running.

672
01:22:41,865 --> 01:22:46,495
Here's what we got on the ELF.

673
01:22:48,438 --> 01:22:51,032
Thanks.

674
01:22:58,214 --> 01:23:01,980
What is it?

675
01:23:02,152 --> 01:23:05,212
You're not going to believe this.

676
01:23:17,434 --> 01:23:21,768
We're approaching no return.
Dallas probably didn't get the message.

677
01:23:21,938 --> 01:23:26,398
- We have to turn back.
- Give it a couple more minutes.

678
01:23:26,576 --> 01:23:30,808
You've got a reserve fuel tank.

679
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:35,076
I've got a ten minute reserve. I can't
invade that except in time of war.

680
01:23:35,251 --> 01:23:39,915
If you don't get me on that sub,
that's what you'll have.

681
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:44,254
If you've got ten minutes of fuel,
we stay here ten minutes.

682
01:23:47,764 --> 01:23:53,225
I've got a submarine at three o'clock.
About two miles.

683
01:23:55,738 --> 01:24:00,334
- Okay, hook him up.
- I'll be lowering you down to the sub.

684
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:05,277
Let's hope this thing runs on fumes.

685
01:24:05,448 --> 01:24:11,250
Surface the ship.
This guy is in for a hell of a ride.

686
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:14,948
Okay, Commander, sit down.

687
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:20,358
- Did you ever do this before?
- Once, on a calm day.

688
01:24:20,530 --> 01:24:24,091
The pilot will have trouble
keeping it steady.

689
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:27,430
Don't get grounded with that rod.

690
01:24:27,604 --> 01:24:32,041
The rotors will be putting out enough
static to light up Chicago.

691
01:24:32,208 --> 01:24:36,770
I've got a diver ready
in case this guy goes in the drink.

692
01:24:36,946 --> 01:24:40,575
Who would go for a stunt like this!

693
01:25:05,008 --> 01:25:08,910
If I've got to bring you back up,
I'll shake the wire.

694
01:25:09,078 --> 01:25:14,072
I'll give you a thumbs up.
Remember to cross your arms.

695
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:17,242
Okay, out you go.

696
01:25:24,327 --> 01:25:28,195
He's halfway down.
You're drifting forward.

697
01:25:32,402 --> 01:25:35,633
Get the hook on his cable.

698
01:25:35,805 --> 01:25:39,901
Watch it! Don't touch him.
Okay, here he comes.

699
01:25:46,883 --> 01:25:51,252
It'd be easier without that crosswind.
I can't see him.

700
01:25:53,723 --> 01:25:56,624
Don't touch him!

701
01:26:01,130 --> 01:26:05,726
- This is never going to work.
- Reel him back in.

702
01:26:12,675 --> 01:26:15,075
What's going on?

703
01:26:18,648 --> 01:26:21,481
Dallas, have you got a swimmer?

704
01:26:21,651 --> 01:26:26,213
Man overboard, port side.
Send out the diver.

705
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:30,519
Dallas, we are history.

706
01:26:38,001 --> 01:26:42,062
Get the doc down here.
I'll be in the escape trunk.

707
01:26:45,475 --> 01:26:49,411
Down ladder. Make a hole.

708
01:27:05,228 --> 01:27:09,927
How do you do, Captain?
It's a pleasure to be aboard.

709
01:27:11,901 --> 01:27:15,564
I have to talk to the President.

710
01:27:15,738 --> 01:27:19,196
Of course.
May I enquire as to the subject?

711
01:27:20,977 --> 01:27:27,610
My report of a missing submarine
was not completely accurate.

712
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:34,952
The submarine in question
is commanded by Marko Ramius.

713
01:27:35,124 --> 01:27:40,562
Apparently he has suffered
a mental or nervous breakdown.

714
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:48,400
Just before he sailed,
he posted a letter to Admiral Padorin -

715
01:27:48,571 --> 01:27:51,165
- in which he announced his intention...

716
01:27:53,643 --> 01:27:56,669
...to fire his missiles on the USA.

717
01:27:58,348 --> 01:28:01,044
Why didn't you tell me this earlier?

718
01:28:01,217 --> 01:28:05,847
Moscow does not
always tell me everything.

719
01:28:06,022 --> 01:28:10,857
So one of your submarine captains
has gone insane?

720
01:28:11,027 --> 01:28:17,694
- You offered your assistance.
- You want us to help you kill him?

721
01:28:19,102 --> 01:28:24,267
I have been instructed to ask
your president for precisely that.

722
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:29,844
We'd already found him.
We had to break off to pick you up.

723
01:28:30,012 --> 01:28:34,244
- Coffee. A cigarette?
- I don't smoke.

724
01:28:34,417 --> 01:28:39,218
Assuming we can find him,
what am I supposed to do about it.

725
01:28:39,389 --> 01:28:43,621
We're receiving flash traffic
on the emergency circuit.

726
01:28:43,793 --> 01:28:45,954
Bring it down.

727
01:28:47,563 --> 01:28:50,259
Well, Mr Ryan?

728
01:28:52,101 --> 01:28:56,538
- Chief, excuse us for a second.
- Come on, Leonard.

729
01:29:02,845 --> 01:29:08,841
The sub is named the Red October,
under the command of Marko Ramius.

730
01:29:09,018 --> 01:29:14,547
There's the possibility that he and
some of the crew want to defect.

731
01:29:16,993 --> 01:29:19,894
Defect?

732
01:29:20,062 --> 01:29:22,087
Excuse me.

733
01:29:38,681 --> 01:29:43,914
The boat's the Red October?
The skipper's Ramius?

734
01:29:44,086 --> 01:29:49,251
It seems that circumstances
have changed somewhat.

735
01:29:56,232 --> 01:30:00,362
Get this man some dry clothes.
I'll be in the conn.

736
01:30:00,536 --> 01:30:05,269
"Soviet submarine Red October
under the command of Marko Ramius -

737
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:10,208
- reported as potential renegade.
Threat of independent missile launch."

738
01:30:10,379 --> 01:30:16,750
"Use any necessary force to prevent
its approach to the United States."

739
01:30:31,100 --> 01:30:36,003
Left 10 degrees rudder.
Steer course 265.

740
01:30:39,775 --> 01:30:42,608
Chief of the Watch, rig for red.

741
01:30:52,955 --> 01:30:57,915
- What's going on?
- Battle stations are manned and ready.

742
01:30:58,094 --> 01:31:04,329
- Captain, I have to talk to you.
- Not now. Take her to 1,200 feet.

743
01:31:04,500 --> 01:31:09,904
Diving officer,
make your depth 1,200 feet.

744
01:31:10,072 --> 01:31:15,977
Full dive on fair water planes.
Full dive on stern planes.

745
01:31:18,614 --> 01:31:22,380
Passing 450 feet, going to 1,200.

746
01:31:22,552 --> 01:31:25,350
500.

747
01:31:26,756 --> 01:31:29,520
600.

748
01:31:29,692 --> 01:31:32,991
700.

749
01:31:36,799 --> 01:31:40,428
- Did you get a good fix?
- Yes, Captain.

750
01:31:47,009 --> 01:31:52,140
- Sonar, have you got him yet, Jonesy?
- Very faint, sir.

751
01:31:53,716 --> 01:31:58,153
Yes, contact on 250.
Right where he's supposed to be.

752
01:31:58,321 --> 01:32:02,849
- Is he alerted to our presence?
- No, sir.

753
01:32:03,025 --> 01:32:08,156
Come left to 265.
Bring us up behind him quietly.

754
01:32:08,331 --> 01:32:10,856
Make your depth 500 feet.

755
01:32:20,176 --> 01:32:23,441
Please listen to me. Two minutes.

756
01:32:25,615 --> 01:32:29,847
- Time to intercept his track?
- Four minutes.

757
01:32:30,019 --> 01:32:33,352
Very well, Mr Ryan. Two minutes.

758
01:32:39,962 --> 01:32:43,864
I understand that message,
it makes perfect sense.

759
01:32:44,033 --> 01:32:48,697
Ramius intends to defect.
The Russians are trying to sink him.

760
01:32:48,871 --> 01:32:53,240
- They haven't been able to.
- I have a firing solution.

761
01:32:53,409 --> 01:32:57,778
The Russians will stop at nothing.

762
01:32:57,947 --> 01:33:03,579
They invented this story because
they need our help to sink him.

763
01:33:05,921 --> 01:33:11,450
Weapons control, full safety. I don't
want this fish coming back at us.

764
01:33:11,627 --> 01:33:14,892
I know this man.

765
01:33:15,931 --> 01:33:21,836
Has he made any Crazy lvans?
His next one will be to starboard.

766
01:33:22,004 --> 01:33:26,964
He always goes to starboard
in the bottom half of the hour.

767
01:33:29,779 --> 01:33:32,646
Flood tubes one and two.

768
01:33:32,815 --> 01:33:37,275
You have to establish contact.
He wants to defect!

769
01:33:37,453 --> 01:33:42,447
Call Chief Watson to the conn
with his sidearm.

770
01:33:46,462 --> 01:33:50,364
Possible aspect change in target.

771
01:33:50,533 --> 01:33:54,469
Concur, change in bearing rate.

772
01:33:55,638 --> 01:33:58,198
Crazy lvan!

773
01:34:00,876 --> 01:34:05,438
Captain, he's turning.

774
01:34:08,818 --> 01:34:12,754
- Which way is he turning?
- To the starboard.

775
01:34:12,922 --> 01:34:16,653
Give the man a chance.

776
01:34:18,461 --> 01:34:21,396
- All back full.
- Say again.

777
01:34:21,564 --> 01:34:24,863
- All back full!
- Aye, sir.

778
01:34:29,805 --> 01:34:35,573
- We're cavitating! He can hear us.
- All stop.

779
01:34:36,479 --> 01:34:39,004
We just unzipped our fly.

780
01:34:39,181 --> 01:34:44,346
Open the outer door.
Firing point procedures.

781
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:48,513
If the bastard twitches,
I'm going to blow him to Mars.

782
01:34:48,691 --> 01:34:51,524
All stop.

783
01:34:51,694 --> 01:34:55,061
Can you identify the contact?

784
01:34:55,231 --> 01:35:00,396
Los Angeles class attack sub.
Bearing: 015. Range: 300 metres.

785
01:35:00,569 --> 01:35:03,402
Opening torpedo tube doors.

786
01:35:03,572 --> 01:35:06,666
Outer doors open. Ready to shoot.

787
01:35:06,842 --> 01:35:11,404
Very well. My orders are specific.

788
01:35:11,580 --> 01:35:14,606
He is preparing to fire.

789
01:35:14,784 --> 01:35:19,585
Flood tubes three and four
and plot a solution.

790
01:35:22,024 --> 01:35:24,515
Shall I open the torpedo tube doors?

791
01:35:27,663 --> 01:35:32,999
- Shall I open the outer doors?
- No.

792
01:35:33,169 --> 01:35:36,969
Lock the firing solution
into the computer.

793
01:35:37,139 --> 01:35:40,165
Do not open the doors.

794
01:35:46,315 --> 01:35:52,276
Aye, Captain.
Lock solution into computer.

795
01:35:52,454 --> 01:35:57,585
- Target has flooded his tubes.
- Has he opened his outer doors?

796
01:35:57,760 --> 01:36:01,389
Negative. He'sjust sitting there.

797
01:36:02,598 --> 01:36:07,592
- Target is coming shallow.
- What does that mean?

798
01:36:09,572 --> 01:36:12,735
It means he's a very cool customer.

799
01:36:12,908 --> 01:36:18,437
He knows we're ready to shoot.
He's heading for the surface.

800
01:36:18,614 --> 01:36:22,778
- What's his course now?
- 270. Due west.

801
01:36:22,952 --> 01:36:26,285
Bring us alongside him.

802
01:36:26,455 --> 01:36:29,481
Sonar, report all contacts.

803
01:36:29,658 --> 01:36:34,061
My only contact is Typhoon 7.

804
01:36:34,230 --> 01:36:39,167
- Range to target?
- Range is 300 yards.

805
01:36:40,669 --> 01:36:45,072
Make your depth 65 feet.

806
01:36:46,275 --> 01:36:50,507
He wants to go up and take a peek.
We'll play along.

807
01:37:09,933 --> 01:37:12,197
Weapons status?

808
01:37:12,369 --> 01:37:17,033
Tubes three and four are flooded,
but outer doors are closed.

809
01:37:29,386 --> 01:37:35,655
You wanted to talk to him.
What do you want to say?

810
01:37:35,826 --> 01:37:40,024
Will he be the only one
looking through the periscope?

811
01:37:40,197 --> 01:37:43,530
We'll have to chance that.

812
01:37:43,701 --> 01:37:47,865
"US told you intend missile launch."

813
01:37:48,038 --> 01:37:53,476
"Do not approach US coast
or you will be attacked."

814
01:37:53,644 --> 01:37:58,741
"If intention is other,
will you discuss option?"

815
01:37:59,683 --> 01:38:02,846
Can he acknowledge
with a single ping?

816
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:07,286
He can. The question is, will he?

817
01:38:13,664 --> 01:38:19,534
Verify our range to target.
One ping only.

818
01:38:20,704 --> 01:38:23,298
Aye, Captain.

819
01:38:28,879 --> 01:38:32,337
I'll be damned. Now what?

820
01:38:34,618 --> 01:38:38,645
All right. "If defection..."

821
01:38:45,395 --> 01:38:50,059
Chart. I need a chart.

822
01:38:52,169 --> 01:38:56,970
Where the hell are we?
Someplace deep.

823
01:38:59,576 --> 01:39:03,205
Okay, send him this.

824
01:39:06,517 --> 01:39:10,783
- Are you out of your mind?
- Just send it.

825
01:39:14,057 --> 01:39:19,256
How did you know
he was going to go to starboard?

826
01:39:19,429 --> 01:39:24,958
I didn't. I had a 50-50 chance
and I needed a break. Sorry.

827
01:39:26,737 --> 01:39:30,229
That's all right. My Morse is so rusty, -

828
01:39:30,407 --> 01:39:34,969
- I may be sending him dimensions
on playmate of the month.

829
01:39:53,564 --> 01:39:56,829
Reverify our range to target.

830
01:39:57,000 --> 01:40:01,494
- One ping only.
- Captain, I just...

831
01:40:01,672 --> 01:40:06,132
Give me a ping, Vassily.
One ping only, please.

832
01:40:08,979 --> 01:40:11,413
Aye, Captain.

833
01:40:15,252 --> 01:40:18,483
What the hell is this about?

834
01:40:18,655 --> 01:40:24,423
The Russians want us to sink her.
We might have to do that.

835
01:40:32,135 --> 01:40:36,128
We must give this American
a wide berth.

836
01:40:37,174 --> 01:40:41,008
Let us turn south.

837
01:40:49,386 --> 01:40:55,848
Mr Kamarov, plot a new course
due south.

838
01:40:58,028 --> 01:41:01,054
New course: 180.

839
01:41:34,665 --> 01:41:37,998
Shut down the reactor.

840
01:41:38,168 --> 01:41:43,105
- Seal the ventilation system.
- The ventilation controls have failed.

841
01:41:43,273 --> 01:41:47,573
Everybody out!
Clear the compartment.

842
01:41:57,621 --> 01:42:02,320
- Shut the ventilation system down.
- The controls don't respond.

843
01:42:02,492 --> 01:42:06,189
Bypass it. Seal it manually. Move!

844
01:42:07,464 --> 01:42:10,297
Say again.

845
01:42:17,240 --> 01:42:23,270
We suffered a leak in the cooling tube.
The ventilation circuits are disabled.

846
01:42:23,447 --> 01:42:28,749
- The coolant is contaminated.
- I knew it was damaged.

847
01:42:28,919 --> 01:42:34,186
Radiation alarms are activated
in all compartments.

848
01:42:34,358 --> 01:42:39,489
Get us to periscope depth.
We'll ventilate with outside air.

849
01:42:39,663 --> 01:42:43,997
Ventilating won't do anything.
Get the men off.

850
01:42:44,167 --> 01:42:48,103
- What is the battery condition?
- Four hours.

851
01:42:48,271 --> 01:42:53,607
- Engage battery system.
- The whole ship is contaminated.

852
01:42:53,777 --> 01:42:57,235
We've got to get the men off.

853
01:42:57,414 --> 01:43:00,406
Sir, we have been sabotaged.

854
01:43:00,584 --> 01:43:04,042
- Who said anything about sabotage?
- Captain!

855
01:43:04,221 --> 01:43:07,657
I'm afraid the doctor is right.

856
01:43:11,962 --> 01:43:17,559
Very well. Surface.
We'll evacuate the men to the deck.

857
01:43:17,734 --> 01:43:22,797
Surface the ship. Muster all personnel
to escape hatches.

858
01:43:22,973 --> 01:43:29,936
Break out the rafts. We'll use them
as shelters until the fleet arrives.

859
01:44:12,055 --> 01:44:17,755
Make sure the count is accurate.
We must get the entire crew out.

860
01:44:17,928 --> 01:44:24,800
Master at Arms reports rafts secure
and evacuation proceeding.

861
01:44:30,407 --> 01:44:38,337
No officer will spend more than
20 minutes below deck.

862
01:44:38,515 --> 01:44:44,613
Surface contact: 270.
Six miles and closing fast.

863
01:44:44,788 --> 01:44:48,656
- It's a warship!
- Here? Can you identify?

864
01:44:48,825 --> 01:44:54,491
It's a US frigate. Probably Perry class.
He's signalling.

865
01:44:54,664 --> 01:45:00,364
Red October,
halt and stay where you are.

866
01:45:00,537 --> 01:45:04,029
Do not attempt to submerge
or you will be fired upon.

867
01:45:06,776 --> 01:45:09,711
He means to board us.

868
01:45:15,819 --> 01:45:21,451
You will go with the crew. The officers
and I will submerge beneath you.

869
01:45:21,625 --> 01:45:26,927
- We'll scuttle the ship.
- You will receive the Order of Lenin.

870
01:45:36,907 --> 01:45:42,436
Prepare to cast off.
The captain is going to scuttle the ship.

871
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:51,812
- He's going down, sir.
- Put a shot across his bow.

872
01:46:22,085 --> 01:46:24,849
Seahawk One, this is Bravo Command.

873
01:46:43,506 --> 01:46:46,634
She's ready.

874
01:46:46,810 --> 01:46:49,608
Release on my command.

875
01:46:49,779 --> 01:46:52,441
Drop now.

876
01:47:01,024 --> 01:47:05,518
Range to target 900 yards...
800 yards...

877
01:47:07,931 --> 01:47:13,233
700 yards... 600 yards...

878
01:47:18,275 --> 01:47:23,736
500 yards... 400 yards...

879
01:47:25,915 --> 01:47:28,383
300 yards.

880
01:47:30,820 --> 01:47:33,812
The torpedo is detonated.

881
01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:40,589
That torpedo did not self-destruct.
You heard it hit the hull.

882
01:47:40,764 --> 01:47:44,723
And I was never here.

883
01:47:44,901 --> 01:47:50,066
- Give Dallas the go.
- Get the DSRV moving.

884
01:47:58,748 --> 01:48:02,684
Two million things
can still go wrong with this stunt.

885
01:48:02,852 --> 01:48:08,518
Central Intelligence Agency...
there's a contradiction in terms.

886
01:48:09,559 --> 01:48:12,392
How's the coffee, Ryan?

887
01:48:12,562 --> 01:48:18,228
Dallas, this is the Mystic.
Request clearance to launch.

888
01:48:19,536 --> 01:48:25,634
- Hatch is secured.
- We're ready to launch.

889
01:48:25,809 --> 01:48:31,145
- Flood the skirt.
- Skirt filled and equalised.

890
01:48:31,314 --> 01:48:35,717
- Ready to lift off.
- Okay, let's do it.

891
01:48:38,488 --> 01:48:41,218
Thrusting to port.

892
01:49:00,877 --> 01:49:06,941
- 600 yards and closing.
- Steer right to course 075.

893
01:49:11,921 --> 01:49:17,291
200 yards... 100 yards.

894
01:49:24,534 --> 01:49:27,196
Hit the lights.

895
01:49:39,549 --> 01:49:42,985
Jesus! That's a big sucker.

896
01:49:59,169 --> 01:50:03,333
- Okay, we're in position.
- You can open the hatch.

897
01:50:03,506 --> 01:50:10,070
Hold it a second. Jonesy...
Mr Ryan.

898
01:50:13,483 --> 01:50:18,750
- He's defecting.
- And he can't change his mind?

899
01:50:18,922 --> 01:50:23,859
- He's not going to change his mind.
- Will you bet your life on that?

900
01:50:44,047 --> 01:50:47,278
Sir, could you hand me that hammer?

901
01:51:09,639 --> 01:51:14,008
Americans.

902
01:53:19,502 --> 01:53:22,733
What's so funny?

903
01:53:22,905 --> 01:53:26,966
The captain thinks
you're some sort of cowboy.

904
01:53:41,224 --> 01:53:43,317
It is.

905
01:53:45,328 --> 01:53:50,265
I doubt that you remember, but
we met at the consulate in Leningrad.

906
01:53:50,433 --> 01:53:56,030
Along with your wife.
I'm very sorry.

907
01:53:56,205 --> 01:54:00,869
What gives you the right
to fire on my ship?

908
01:54:01,044 --> 01:54:05,310
- You said nothing of a torpedo.
- Ryan.

909
01:54:06,549 --> 01:54:12,419
- We had to maintain the illusion.
- Are my crew being rescued?

910
01:54:12,588 --> 01:54:16,319
As we speak.

911
01:54:18,461 --> 01:54:23,524
- You sent the signal?
- That's correct, sir.

912
01:54:23,700 --> 01:54:29,639
How did you know that
our reactor accident was false?

913
01:54:29,806 --> 01:54:33,173
That was a guess,
but it seemed logical.

914
01:54:39,582 --> 01:54:42,346
Very well.

915
01:54:45,021 --> 01:54:50,584
I present to you the ballistic missile
submarine Red October.

916
01:54:54,831 --> 01:55:01,293
My officers and I
request asylum in the USA.

917
01:55:03,973 --> 01:55:09,275
It's a pleasure, sir.
Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

918
01:55:11,647 --> 01:55:17,176
- Torpedo. The Americans are shooting.
- The pitch is too high. It's Russian.

919
01:55:19,655 --> 01:55:21,680
Another torpedo?

920
01:55:21,858 --> 01:55:24,986
Sonar contact.
Alfa class Soviet submarine.

921
01:55:28,664 --> 01:55:35,297
- Why don't I have a detonation?
- The weapon armed too late.

922
01:55:35,471 --> 01:55:39,305
You had the wrong range.
Fire again with the right setting.

923
01:55:39,475 --> 01:55:44,640
Get me power,
and get that damn thing off my boat.

924
01:55:44,814 --> 01:55:50,480
- Somebody just shot at us.
- No shit! Get out of here.

925
01:56:05,701 --> 01:56:08,898
Borodin, fire control.

926
01:56:09,071 --> 01:56:13,770
- Ryan, sit here.
- I'm not with the Navy. I'm CIA.

927
01:56:13,943 --> 01:56:18,277
- CIA?
- I write books for them.

928
01:56:19,582 --> 01:56:22,551
Sit down and do what I tell you.

929
01:56:22,718 --> 01:56:26,119
Russian Alfa, 8,000 yards to starboard.

930
01:56:26,289 --> 01:56:32,626
- I think it's the Konovalov.
- Increase to flank.

931
01:56:33,796 --> 01:56:37,698
That knob, turn right full.

932
01:56:37,867 --> 01:56:41,963
- All ahead flank. Right full rudder.
- He's shooting again.

933
01:56:42,138 --> 01:56:45,301
Battle stations.

934
01:56:50,413 --> 01:56:54,975
- Torpedo in the water. Bearing 315.
- Make range 7,000 yards.

935
01:56:55,151 --> 01:57:01,522
- Steer right 315.
- That's heading into the torpedo.

936
01:57:01,691 --> 01:57:08,096
- Estimate range 6,000 yards.
- Steer right 315.

937
01:57:08,264 --> 01:57:12,667
That's wrong!
Ryan, don't turn that wheel.

938
01:57:12,835 --> 01:57:16,100
315.

939
01:57:26,382 --> 01:57:30,409
- You're heading straight for it.
- Yes.

940
01:57:30,620 --> 01:57:34,681
- Doing what?
- He's turning into it.

941
01:57:34,857 --> 01:57:39,851
- He's directly in the torpedo's path.
- Mother of God!

942
01:57:40,029 --> 01:57:44,591
Torpedo steady at 315.
Range: 5,000 yards.

943
01:57:44,767 --> 01:57:48,760
- More speed.
- We're already at 110%.

944
01:57:48,938 --> 01:57:54,570
- Run at 115%.
- Range: 3,000 yards and closing fast.

945
01:58:01,250 --> 01:58:07,246
- He's heading right at the torpedo.
- Can we shoot at the Russian Alfa?

946
01:58:07,423 --> 01:58:12,122
I can't attack a Soviet submarine
without authorisation.

947
01:58:14,931 --> 01:58:20,494
Torpedo steady at 315.
Range: 900 yards.

948
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:24,902
Torpedo impact: 20 seconds.

949
01:58:26,208 --> 01:58:30,372
- What books?
- Pardon me?

950
01:58:30,546 --> 01:58:36,041
- What books did you write?
- A biography on Admiral Halsey.

951
01:58:36,218 --> 01:58:42,817
- It's about naval combat tactics.
- I know this book.

952
01:58:42,992 --> 01:58:47,759
Your conclusions were all wrong.
Halsey acted stupidly.

953
01:58:47,930 --> 01:58:53,095
Nine, eight, seven, six...

954
01:58:53,269 --> 01:58:59,105
...five, four, three, two...

955
01:58:59,275 --> 01:59:02,472
Torpedo impact now.

956
01:59:11,821 --> 01:59:15,655
I'll be dammed.

957
01:59:15,825 --> 01:59:20,319
- What happened?
- Combat tactics.

958
01:59:20,496 --> 01:59:26,526
The captain closed the distance
before the torpedo could arm itself.

959
01:59:26,702 --> 01:59:29,535
- That's it?
- Not quite.

960
01:59:29,705 --> 01:59:36,975
Capt. Tupolev will be removing
the safety features on all his weapons.

961
01:59:37,146 --> 01:59:42,413
- Vassily, have you plotted a solution?
- It's a little rough...

962
01:59:48,924 --> 01:59:52,052
Gunfire.

963
01:59:52,228 --> 01:59:56,062
- He won't change his mind?
- It's one of the crew.

964
01:59:56,232 --> 02:00:00,100
Whoever he is,
I'd say he's having second thoughts.

965
02:00:16,118 --> 02:00:19,554
I would like to have seen Montana.

966
02:00:32,635 --> 02:00:38,699
He's in the missile bay. We're showing
a hatch warning on number 20.

967
02:00:38,874 --> 02:00:43,038
- He can't launch a missile?
- No, but he can blow one up.

968
02:00:45,247 --> 02:00:50,310
Captain, take the conn.
Get in behind him and stay there.

969
02:00:50,486 --> 02:00:53,216
Captain, wait.

970
02:00:55,891 --> 02:00:58,985
You may need this, sir.

971
02:01:01,664 --> 02:01:03,928
Thank you.

972
02:01:06,569 --> 02:01:12,633
Don't just stand there, go with him!
You, get your butt over here.

973
02:01:12,808 --> 02:01:19,441
- The torpedo broke up on impact.
- Set the safety ranges for zero.

974
02:01:19,615 --> 02:01:24,211
We must get him
before he gets to the ignition circuits.

975
02:01:31,293 --> 02:01:34,751
What happens if he gets
to the ignition circuits?

976
02:01:34,930 --> 02:01:37,922
He can incinerate the ship.

977
02:01:45,307 --> 02:01:50,040
- Is that the only way out of here?
- Yes.

978
02:01:50,212 --> 02:01:55,343
- Don't let him get past you.
- Ryan...

979
02:01:55,518 --> 02:01:58,885
Be careful what you shoot at.

980
02:01:59,054 --> 02:02:03,889
Most things in here
don't react too well to bullets.

981
02:02:05,694 --> 02:02:08,322
Right.

982
02:02:25,614 --> 02:02:28,674
Be careful what I shoot at?

983
02:02:36,992 --> 02:02:41,088
- Safety ranges set to zero.
- Where's Red October?

984
02:02:41,263 --> 02:02:46,895
- She's behind us.
- Right full rudder. I'll shake him loose.

985
02:02:53,209 --> 02:02:56,940
- He's going deep.
- 30 degree down angle.

986
02:02:57,112 --> 02:02:59,706
Order counter measures.

987
02:03:25,207 --> 02:03:29,109
The Alfa is too quick.
It's only a matter of time.

988
02:03:29,278 --> 02:03:34,807
"Some things in here
don't react well to bullets..."

989
02:03:34,984 --> 02:03:38,420
Yeah, like me.

990
02:03:57,406 --> 02:04:01,172
- Where is he?
- Close, sir.

991
02:04:03,178 --> 02:04:06,614
- 900 metres, directly ahead.
- Got him.

992
02:04:06,782 --> 02:04:09,945
- Mark bearings and fire.
- We are too close.

993
02:04:10,119 --> 02:04:15,489
Don't argue with me. Do it now!

994
02:04:16,959 --> 02:04:20,417
Another torpedo,
it went active as it was launched.

995
02:04:20,629 --> 02:04:25,396
- Left full rudder. Ease her up.
- I think he's got us.

996
02:04:35,244 --> 02:04:38,736
Way to go, Dallas!

997
02:04:42,551 --> 02:04:47,648
Torpedo in acquisition.
Range 500 yards. You've done it.

998
02:04:47,823 --> 02:04:52,089
I hope this works.
Chief, put us on the roof.

999
02:04:52,261 --> 02:04:55,697
Counter measures on my mark.
5, 4...

1000
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:03,597
Release counter measures.
Emergency blow. Full rise.

1001
02:05:10,813 --> 02:05:14,408
500 feet.

1002
02:05:14,583 --> 02:05:17,746
Come on, Big D. Fly!

1003
02:05:36,805 --> 02:05:40,468
That torpedo is still active.
It's searching for another target.

1004
02:06:05,801 --> 02:06:10,898
A goddamn cook.

1005
02:06:33,729 --> 02:06:36,926
It's locked on us!

1006
02:06:37,099 --> 02:06:42,594
- How close is that Alfa?
- 1,000 yards dead astern.

1007
02:06:48,043 --> 02:06:52,173
We're turning straight at him.
The torpedo is still on our tail.

1008
02:06:56,218 --> 02:07:00,848
The hard part about playing chicken
is knowing when to flinch.

1009
02:07:06,361 --> 02:07:10,422
Collision in 400 yards, 350, 300...

1010
02:07:10,599 --> 02:07:16,299
- Captain!
- Right full rudder. 30 degree angle.

1011
02:07:16,472 --> 02:07:19,930
This is going to be close.

1012
02:07:22,744 --> 02:07:26,544
You arrogant ass, you've killed us.

1013
02:07:54,977 --> 02:07:58,140
We have ascertained
the Red October's final position.

1014
02:08:00,616 --> 02:08:04,575
Given the depth of the water
and the spread of the wreckage, -

1015
02:08:04,753 --> 02:08:07,688
- nothing has yet been recovered.

1016
02:08:07,856 --> 02:08:13,488
Your people are with the crew and are
making arrangements for their return.

1017
02:08:13,662 --> 02:08:17,996
This has been a terrible tragedy.

1018
02:08:18,166 --> 02:08:23,399
If you'd come to us earlier,
it might have been avoided.

1019
02:08:24,506 --> 02:08:30,411
- I appreciate your candour in this.
- And I yours, Andrei.

1020
02:08:33,181 --> 02:08:38,881
In the future, technology may allow
an investigation of the wreckage.

1021
02:08:39,054 --> 02:08:42,888
Perhaps.

1022
02:08:47,195 --> 02:08:53,464
There is another matter,
one that I'm reluctant to...

1023
02:08:55,070 --> 02:09:02,067
One of our submarines, an Alfa,
was last reported in the Grand Banks.

1024
02:09:02,244 --> 02:09:06,510
We've not heard from her
for some time.

1025
02:09:07,816 --> 02:09:12,344
You've lost another submarine?

1026
02:09:26,902 --> 02:09:31,236
All this way
to hide a submarine in a river.

1027
02:09:32,441 --> 02:09:38,573
It's 100 miles from any naval base.
It's the last place a satellite will look.

1028
02:09:40,082 --> 02:09:43,950
I grew up around here.

1029
02:09:44,119 --> 02:09:49,523
My grandfather taught me to fish
off that island over there.

1030
02:09:52,527 --> 02:09:59,592
There is one question
you haven't asked me yet: Why?

1031
02:10:01,269 --> 02:10:04,602
I figured you would tell me
when you were ready.

1032
02:10:07,542 --> 02:10:12,138
There are those who believe
we should attack the USA first.

1033
02:10:12,314 --> 02:10:18,810
Settle everything in one moment.
Red October was built for that purpose.

1034
02:10:18,987 --> 02:10:24,550
- Now there'll be hell to pay in Moscow.
- Perhaps.

1035
02:10:24,726 --> 02:10:27,923
Maybe some good will come from it.

1036
02:10:28,096 --> 02:10:33,762
A little revolution now and then
is a healthy thing.

1037
02:10:39,574 --> 02:10:43,340
Do you still like to fish?

1038
02:10:44,780 --> 02:10:48,682
There's a river not unlike this
near Vilnius, -

1039
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:53,514
- where my grandfather
taught me to fish.

1040
02:10:54,589 --> 02:10:59,322
"And the sea will grant
each man new hope."

1041
02:10:59,494 --> 02:11:03,123
"As sleep brings dreams."

1042
02:11:09,204 --> 02:11:12,037
Christopher Columbus.

1043
02:11:15,777 --> 02:11:19,144
Welcome to the new world, sir.

1044
02:15:00,769 --> 02:15:04,933
