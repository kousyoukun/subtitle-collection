and a voice cried out
from heaven, saying,

170
00:15:25,496 --> 00:15:27,361
'lt is done.'''

171
00:15:29,467 --> 00:15:31,401
A man with your responsibilities

172
00:15:31,469 --> 00:15:34,098
reading about the end
of the world. Huh.

173
00:15:34,172 --> 00:15:35,571
And what's this?

174
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,040
''l am become death,

175
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,045
the destroyer of worlds.''

176
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:43,547
It is an ancient Hindu text

177
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,082
quoted by an American.

178
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,117
American?

179
00:15:46,184 --> 00:15:48,584
Mmm.
He invented the atomic bomb,

180
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:51,383
and he was later accused
of being a Communist.

181
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:54,823
You wrote and underlined
these passages?

182
00:15:56,495 --> 00:15:57,587
No.

183
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:02,930
This book belonged to my wife.

184
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,968
I keep it
for sentimental value.

185
00:16:05,035 --> 00:16:06,935
I'm sorry, comrade Captain.

186
00:16:07,004 --> 00:16:08,938
Your wife was...
a beautiful woman.

187
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:10,997
Her death was... unfortunate.

188
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:13,009
I'm only doing my job.

189
00:16:13,077 --> 00:16:14,669
It is my responsibility.

190
00:16:17,581 --> 00:16:21,381
How many agents did the KGB
put aboard my boat?

191
00:16:21,452 --> 00:16:22,919
Your boat, Captain?

192
00:16:22,987 --> 00:16:24,249
Yes.

193
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:27,688
This vessel belongs to
the people of the Soviet Union.

194
00:16:27,758 --> 00:16:32,092
Besides, if the KGB or the GRU
has agents aboard,

195
00:16:32,163 --> 00:16:35,223
I will be the last to know.

196
00:16:36,934 --> 00:16:40,028
I suggest we open
our orders, Captain.

197
00:16:41,472 --> 00:16:43,064
Certainly, comrade.

198
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:27,676
''From commander...

199
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:29,377
strategic submarine forces

200
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:31,443
red banner northern fleet.''

201
00:17:31,521 --> 00:17:36,857
We're to proceed north
to grid square reference 54-90

202
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:40,760
and rendezvous with
alfa submarine Konovalov.

203
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,661
Captain Tupolev's boat.

204
00:17:42,732 --> 00:17:44,199
You know Tupolev?

205
00:17:44,267 --> 00:17:46,701
I know he descends
from aristocracy

206
00:17:46,769 --> 00:17:49,897
and that he was your student.

207
00:17:49,973 --> 00:17:51,838
It's rumored he has
a special place

208
00:17:51,908 --> 00:17:53,307
in his heart for you.

209
00:17:53,376 --> 00:17:57,142
There's little room in Tupolev's heart
for anyone but Tupolev.

210
00:18:01,251 --> 00:18:04,880
Having made contact,
we are to run a series of drills.

211
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:07,947
Tupolev will hunt us
while we test our ship.

212
00:18:08,025 --> 00:18:09,492
Having evaluated
the operational readiness

213
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,992
of the caterpillar drive,

214
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,994
we are to return to Polijarny

215
00:18:13,062 --> 00:18:15,587
on or about the 16th
of this month.

216
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,568
Captain, this is
an historic moment.

217
00:18:19,636 --> 00:18:21,536
I'd like to make a request.

218
00:18:21,604 --> 00:18:23,071
Before you proceed, comrade--

219
00:18:23,139 --> 00:18:24,697
I know it's not protocol,

220
00:18:24,774 --> 00:18:26,867
but would you permit me
to post our orders

221
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:29,537
and inform the crew
of our mission?

222
00:18:35,585 --> 00:18:36,677
Aah!

223
00:18:54,503 --> 00:18:56,164
Where I'm going...

224
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:58,365
you cannot follow.

225
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,833
Dr. Petrov, report
to my cabin immediately.

226
00:19:30,907 --> 00:19:32,966
There's been
a dreadful accident.

227
00:20:03,171 --> 00:20:04,263
Hey, buddy!

228
00:20:13,482 --> 00:20:15,712
Daniel, got any more rods?

229
00:20:15,784 --> 00:20:16,910
More rods!

230
00:20:16,985 --> 00:20:19,681
Listen to me.
There's no cradle underneath it.

231
00:20:19,755 --> 00:20:21,153
Get it over.

232
00:20:21,222 --> 00:20:23,156
Relax!
Stop being an old maid.

233
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:26,159
You want to come up here
and do it yourself?

234
00:20:26,227 --> 00:20:27,660
All right. Bring her up.

235
00:20:27,728 --> 00:20:28,820
What? What?

236
00:20:30,097 --> 00:20:31,325
Ryan!

237
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,832
Who let you in here?

238
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,060
Hey, Skip,

239
00:20:34,135 --> 00:20:37,002
what, have they got you
playing with models now?

240
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:38,334
Ahh!

241
00:20:38,407 --> 00:20:39,806
Damn it, Bill!

242
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:41,866
Tell them to slow down!

243
00:20:41,943 --> 00:20:43,877
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.

244
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:45,378
Calm down, will you?

245
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:48,314
It's not a model. The DSRV.

246
00:20:48,383 --> 00:20:49,350
Rescue sub.

247
00:20:49,418 --> 00:20:50,851
I know what it is.

248
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,046
What are you doing with it?

249
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:55,555
We're rigging it
with a generic docking collar

250
00:20:55,624 --> 00:20:57,558
so it'll mate with
British, German...

251
00:20:57,626 --> 00:20:58,957
just about anybody's sub.

252
00:20:59,027 --> 00:21:01,359
We can get it
anywhere in the world

253
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,829
in 24 hours.

254
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:05,655
How's your back?

255
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,724
It's fine.

256
00:21:07,802 --> 00:21:10,293
Have you got a minute?

257
00:21:11,639 --> 00:21:14,073
Bigger than
a regular typhoon.

258
00:21:15,142 --> 00:21:16,609
What are these doors?

259
00:21:16,677 --> 00:21:19,077
You don't miss much, do you?

260
00:21:19,146 --> 00:21:22,240
Those are too big
to be torpedo tubes.

261
00:21:23,717 --> 00:21:25,912
Would you launch
an ICBM horizontally?

262
00:21:25,986 --> 00:21:27,977
Sure. Why would you want to?

263
00:21:28,055 --> 00:21:30,182
They're symmetrical.

264
00:21:31,292 --> 00:21:33,783
Right down
the long axis of the sub.

265
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:36,591
How about a towed sonar array?

266
00:21:36,664 --> 00:21:39,258
Nope.
Too close to the screws.

267
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,561
I'll be--

268
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:44,169
This...

269
00:21:44,238 --> 00:21:45,705
This could be a caterpillar.

270
00:21:45,773 --> 00:21:46,762
A what?

271
00:21:46,841 --> 00:21:48,501
Uh, a caterpillar drive.

272
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,975
Magneto-hydrodynamic propulsion.

273
00:21:51,044 --> 00:21:52,341
You follow?

274
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,471
No.

275
00:21:53,547 --> 00:21:56,948
It's like a...
a jet engine for the water.

276
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:59,144
Goes in the front,
gets squirted out the back.

277
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,154
Only it's got no moving parts,

278
00:22:01,222 --> 00:22:03,122
so it's very, very quiet.

279
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,454
Like how quiet?

280
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:08,495
It's doubtful our sonar
would even pick it up.

281
00:22:08,562 --> 00:22:09,961
And if it did,

282
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:11,964
it would sound
like whales humping

283
00:22:12,032 --> 00:22:13,499
or a seismic anomaly.

284
00:22:13,567 --> 00:22:15,000
Anything but a submarine.

285
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:18,232
We messed with this
a couple of years ago.

286
00:22:18,305 --> 00:22:20,000
Couldn't make it work.

287
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:22,442
They really built this?

288
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:25,138
This isn't a mock-up
or anything?

289
00:22:25,212 --> 00:22:27,612
She put to sea this morning.

290
00:22:33,353 --> 00:22:34,752
When I was 12,

291
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:38,257
I helped my daddy build
a bomb shelter in our basement

292
00:22:38,324 --> 00:22:40,758
because some fool parked
a dozen warheads

293
00:22:40,827 --> 00:22:44,319
90 miles off the
coast of Florida.

294
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:47,332
This thing could park
a couple of hundred warheads

295
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,833
off Washington and New York,

296
00:22:48,902 --> 00:22:51,336
and no one would know
anything about it

297
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:53,167
until it was all over.

298
00:23:04,684 --> 00:23:07,175
Are you all right, Captain?

299
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,447
Oh, yes.

300
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,956
It's just to die for something

301
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:13,289
as petty as slipping on tea.

302
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,793
You're blaming yourself, Captain.
It was an accident.

303
00:23:15,862 --> 00:23:18,296
You'll feel better
when we put in.

304
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:19,388
Put in?

305
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:21,126
Well, to base, Captain.

306
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,634
We cannot go on without
a political officer.

307
00:23:23,703 --> 00:23:27,139
Doctor, this is a combat vessel
of the Soviet Navy,

308
00:23:27,206 --> 00:23:29,640
and I'm a senior combat officer.

309
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:33,076
We do not cancel operations
because of accidents.

310
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:35,909
Seaman.

311
00:23:35,982 --> 00:23:38,246
Come here.

312
00:23:38,318 --> 00:23:40,843
Come here.

313
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,547
Your name?

314
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,351
Cook's Assistant, Loginov, sir.

315
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:49,088
Good. I want you and the doctor
to witness this.

316
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:51,255
I'm removing
the political officer's...

317
00:23:51,331 --> 00:23:52,628
missile key--

318
00:23:52,699 --> 00:23:53,961
carry on--

319
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,092
and I'm keeping it myself.

320
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:58,137
Captain, I think
we should report this

321
00:23:58,204 --> 00:24:00,068
to Red Fleet Command.

322
00:24:00,138 --> 00:24:01,366
I'm afraid
that's impossible, Doctor.

323
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,874
Our orders are
for strict radio silence.

324
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,466
Orders, sir.

325
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,943
That's all, Loginov.

326
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:07,944
Yes, sir.

327
00:24:08,013 --> 00:24:11,244
This is most unnerving,
Captain.

328
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,774
The reason for having
two missile keys

329
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:18,016
is so that no one man...

330
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,079
may...

331
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:21,421
May what?

332
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,356
May arm the missiles.

333
00:24:24,429 --> 00:24:26,364
Perhaps I should keep the key.

334
00:24:26,432 --> 00:24:28,400
Thank you.

00:34:41,071 --> 00:34:42,834
So all you got to do--

504
00:34:47,744 --> 00:34:49,507
Look.

505
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:52,513
No one understands
this material better than you.

506
00:34:52,581 --> 00:34:55,015
Just give him
a rundown on the sub

507
00:34:55,084 --> 00:34:57,985
and a precis of the
stuff in your hand.

508
00:34:58,053 --> 00:35:00,578
He's liable to ask
some direct questions.

509
00:35:00,656 --> 00:35:02,021
Give him direct answers.

510
00:35:02,091 --> 00:35:03,786
Tell him what you think.

511
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,188
Come on.

512
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,693
Ahem.

513
00:35:09,765 --> 00:35:10,857
Ahem.

514
00:35:12,101 --> 00:35:14,569
Uh, gentlemen,
the last 24 hours

515
00:35:14,636 --> 00:35:18,299
have seen some extraordinary
Soviet naval activity.

516
00:35:18,373 --> 00:35:21,308
The first to sail
was this ship,

517
00:35:21,376 --> 00:35:23,310
we believe
called the Red October

518
00:35:23,378 --> 00:35:25,972
in reference to
the October Revolution of 1917.

519
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:28,516
A variant
of the typhoon class,

520
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,484
she's some 650 feet long

521
00:35:30,552 --> 00:35:33,043
and 32,000 tons
submerged displacement--

522
00:35:33,122 --> 00:35:34,554
roughly the same size

523
00:35:34,622 --> 00:35:37,591
as a World War Il
aircraft carrier.

524
00:35:37,658 --> 00:35:39,558
We believe that these doors,

525
00:35:39,627 --> 00:35:42,562
here on the bow
and again on the stern,

526
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:44,598
enclose a unique
propulsion system--

527
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:47,725
a magneto-hydrodynamic drive,
or caterpillar,

528
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:51,261
that would enable the sub
to run virtually silent.

529
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,900
It is possible
that this new drive system

530
00:35:53,976 --> 00:35:56,444
allowed the captain,
a man named Ramius,

531
00:35:56,512 --> 00:35:58,946
their senior and perhaps
most respected commander--

532
00:35:59,014 --> 00:36:00,982
Do we have
his picture available?

533
00:36:01,049 --> 00:36:03,882
Allowed Ramius to elude
one of our attack boats,

534
00:36:03,952 --> 00:36:07,353
the Dallas, which trailed Red October
from harbor this morning.

535
00:36:09,158 --> 00:36:10,591
It is also possible

536
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:13,093
that this drive system,
if operable,

537
00:36:13,162 --> 00:36:15,096
could render the Red October

538
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:17,631
undetectable to
our Sosus warning nets

539
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,097
in the Atlantic.

540
00:36:19,167 --> 00:36:21,601
Mr. Ryan, would you
characterize this

541
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:23,762
as a first-strike weapon?

542
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:29,142
Uh, that is a possibility, sir.

543
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,644
It is designed
to approach by stealth

544
00:36:31,712 --> 00:36:33,111
and to shower its target

545
00:36:33,181 --> 00:36:34,614
with multiple
independent warheads

546
00:36:34,682 --> 00:36:36,809
with little or no warning
before impact.

547
00:36:36,884 --> 00:36:40,342
Goddamn thing's made
to start a war.

548
00:36:41,355 --> 00:36:42,822
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

549
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:45,791
About the same time
the Dallas lost contact,

550
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,327
there were additional sailings

551
00:36:47,395 --> 00:36:50,421
from Polijarny and from
Leningrad on the Baltic

552
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:52,261
and from the Mediterranean.

553
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,995
There are now
some 58 nuclear submarines

554
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:57,629
headed at high speed
into the Atlantic.

555
00:36:57,705 --> 00:37:00,366
This afternoon a satellite pass
over Polijarny

556
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,965
found heat blooms
in the engineering plants

557
00:37:03,043 --> 00:37:04,670
at the Kirov, the Minsk,

558
00:37:04,744 --> 00:37:07,179
and more than 20 other
cruisers and destroyers,

559
00:37:07,248 --> 00:37:09,478
indicating they were
preparing to sail.

560
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:12,713
This constitutes the bulk
of the Soviet surface fleet.

561
00:37:12,787 --> 00:37:14,220
Admiral Greer,
your conclusions.

562
00:37:14,288 --> 00:37:15,585
Well, sir,

563
00:37:15,656 --> 00:37:18,557
the data support
no conclusions as yet.

564
00:37:18,626 --> 00:37:21,459
The absence of activity
in the Pacific

565
00:37:21,529 --> 00:37:23,963
suggests this could
be just an exercise.

566
00:37:24,031 --> 00:37:25,999
It may have nothing to do--

567
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:28,001
Suppose it's not an exercise?

568
00:37:28,069 --> 00:37:29,468
Suppose this
is the beginning

569
00:37:29,537 --> 00:37:30,970
of a move against NATO?

570
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:32,972
NSA can speak for that,
Mr. Pelt.

571
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:36,168
I must emphasize the extreme
sensitivity of this information

572
00:37:36,244 --> 00:37:38,678
and that it not leave the room.

573
00:37:38,746 --> 00:37:40,179
Before sailing, Captain Ramius

574
00:37:40,248 --> 00:37:42,842
sent a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin,

575
00:37:42,917 --> 00:37:44,383
Chairman of the Red Fleet

576
00:37:44,451 --> 00:37:46,180
northern political directorate.

577
00:37:46,253 --> 00:37:47,720
That's her uncle.

578
00:37:47,787 --> 00:37:49,516
Whose uncle?

579
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:51,056
Ramius' wife.

580
00:37:51,124 --> 00:37:53,183
Padorin's her uncle.

581
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:57,026
Now, the contents
of the letter are unknown,

582
00:37:57,097 --> 00:37:59,861
but Admiral Padorin
immediately demanded

583
00:37:59,933 --> 00:38:02,060
a meeting
with Premier Chernenko,

584
00:38:02,135 --> 00:38:04,535
and within minutes
of that meeting,

585
00:38:04,604 --> 00:38:06,003
the Soviet fleet sailed

586
00:38:06,072 --> 00:38:08,540
with orders
to find Red October

587
00:38:08,608 --> 00:38:10,200
and sink her.

588
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:12,536
Sink her?

589
00:38:12,612 --> 00:38:15,046
My God. They've got
a madman on their hands.

590
00:38:15,115 --> 00:38:17,879
If it gets within
500 miles of the coast,

591
00:38:17,951 --> 00:38:20,886
we'll have less than
two minutes' warning.

592
00:38:35,902 --> 00:38:37,597
Today's the 23rd, isn't it?

593
00:38:37,671 --> 00:38:38,638
What?

594
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:39,763
Is today the 23rd?

595
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:40,771
Yeah.

596
00:38:51,551 --> 00:38:53,815
You son of a bitch.

597
00:38:54,988 --> 00:38:57,923
You son of a bitch!

598
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:02,658
You wish to add something

599
00:39:02,729 --> 00:39:04,390
to our discussion, Dr. Ryan?

600
00:39:09,836 --> 00:39:11,928
Well, sir,
I was just thinking

601
00:39:12,004 --> 00:39:15,098
that perhaps there's another
possibility we might consider.

602
00:39:16,709 --> 00:39:18,973
Ramius might be
trying to defect.

603
00:39:19,044 --> 00:39:20,170
Do you mean to suggest

604
00:39:20,245 --> 00:39:21,712
that this man has come--

605
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,577
Proceed, Mr. Ryan.

606
00:39:26,552 --> 00:39:27,814
Well...

607
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:30,480
Ramius trained most
of their officer corps,

608
00:39:30,556 --> 00:39:32,990
which would put him
in a position

609
00:39:33,058 --> 00:39:35,993
to select men
willing to help him.

610
00:39:36,061 --> 00:39:37,654
And he's not Russian.

611
00:39:38,665 --> 00:39:40,155
He's Lithuanian by birth,

612
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:43,168
raised by his paternal
grandfather, a fisherman.

613
00:39:43,236 --> 00:39:47,332
And he has no children,
no ties to leave behind.

614
00:39:50,076 --> 00:39:52,806
And today is
the first anniversary

615
00:39:52,879 --> 00:39:54,277
of his wife's death.

616
00:39:54,346 --> 00:39:56,280
Come on.
You're just an analyst.

617
00:39:56,348 --> 00:39:58,543
How can you read his mind?

618
00:39:58,617 --> 00:40:00,209
I know Ramius, General.

619
00:40:00,285 --> 00:40:03,254
He's nearly a legend
in the submarine community.

620
00:40:03,322 --> 00:40:05,552
He's been a maverick
his entire career.

621
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:08,388
I actually met him once
at an embassy dinner.

622
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,020
Have you ever met
Captain Ramius, General?

623
00:40:19,838 --> 00:40:21,237
Admiral Hollis,

624
00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:24,764
how long before Ramius
could be in a position

625
00:40:24,843 --> 00:40:27,277
to fire his missiles at us?

626
00:40:27,346 --> 00:40:28,574
Four days.

627
00:40:28,647 --> 00:40:31,081
All right.
I'll brief the President.

628
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:33,345
That will be all, gentlemen.

629
00:40:33,419 --> 00:40:34,750
Dr. Ryan,

630
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:38,414
would you stay
for a moment, please?

631
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:41,583
I said speak your mind,
Jack, but Jesus...

632
00:40:53,538 --> 00:40:57,305
You slammed the door
on the general pretty hard, Jack.

633
00:40:57,376 --> 00:40:59,810
That was not my intention, sir.

634
00:40:59,878 --> 00:41:01,311
Oh, yes, it was.

635
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:02,779
He was patronizing you,

636
00:41:02,848 --> 00:41:04,782
and you stomped on him.

637
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,284
In my opinion,
he deserved it.

638
00:41:07,352 --> 00:41:09,445
Listen, I'm a politician,

639
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:11,955
which means I'm
a cheat and a liar,

640
00:41:12,024 --> 00:41:14,151
and when I'm
not kissing babies,

641
00:41:14,226 --> 00:41:15,784
I'm stealing
their lollipops,

642
00:41:15,861 --> 00:41:21,059
but it also means
that I keep my options open.

643
00:41:21,132 --> 00:41:27,332
So let's assume for a minute
that you're right

644
00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:29,999
and this Russian
intends to defect.

645
00:41:31,042 --> 00:41:33,670
What do you suggest
we do about it?

646
00:41:35,513 --> 00:41:37,447
We definitely
grab the boat, sir.

647
00:41:37,515 --> 00:41:39,608
Hey, wait a minute.

648
00:41:39,684 --> 00:41:43,051
We're not talking about
some stray pilot with a M.I.G.

649
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:45,555
We're talking about several
billion dollars' worth

650
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:47,056
of Soviet state property.

651
00:41:47,125 --> 00:41:49,059
They're going to want it back.

652
00:41:49,127 --> 00:41:50,526
Maybe it's enough then

653
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:53,564
just to get some people
onboard and inspect it.

654
00:41:53,631 --> 00:41:55,565
Call it whatever
you want to--

655
00:41:55,633 --> 00:41:57,601
a Coast Guard
safety inspection.

656
00:41:57,668 --> 00:42:00,398
So how do we proceed?

657
00:42:00,471 --> 00:42:01,870
First, we need to contact

658
00:42:01,939 --> 00:42:04,873
the commanders
in the Atlantic directly.

659
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:06,875
The Russians get
one whiff of this

660
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,570
through the regular
communications circuits,

661
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:10,079
the game is up.

662
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:13,083
Second, we figure out
how we can help them.

663
00:42:13,151 --> 00:42:15,085
We devise a plan to intercede,

664
00:42:15,153 --> 00:42:17,587
ready to go at a moment's notice.

665
00:42:17,655 --> 00:42:20,647
Third, somebody's got to
go make contact with Ramius

666
00:42:20,725 --> 00:42:23,489
and find out what
his intentions really are.

667
00:42:23,561 --> 00:42:24,789
OK.

668
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:26,261
When do you leave?

669
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,797
Ha ha ha!

670
00:42:27,865 --> 00:42:29,924
Wait a minute.

671
00:42:31,202 --> 00:42:32,635
The general was right.

672
00:42:32,703 --> 00:42:34,102
I am not field personnel.

673
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:35,605
I am only an analyst.

674
00:42:35,673 --> 00:42:36,765
You're perfect.

675
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:39,639
I can't ask any
of these characters to go.

676
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:41,143
They don't believe in it.

677
00:42:41,212 --> 00:42:42,770
They'd never stake
their reputation

678
00:42:42,847 --> 00:42:44,280
on a hunch, whereas you...

679
00:42:44,348 --> 00:42:45,781
Are expendable.

680
00:42:48,218 --> 00:42:49,776
Something like that.

681
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,158
I'll give you three days

682
00:42:55,225 --> 00:42:57,125
to prove your theory correct.

683
00:42:57,194 --> 00:42:58,627
After that,

684
00:42:58,695 --> 00:43:02,131
I have to hunt down Ramius
and destroy him.

685
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:04,133
Will you do it?

686
00:43:20,584 --> 00:43:22,552
Mother of God!

687
00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:24,177
Secure the mast!

688
00:43:24,254 --> 00:43:25,688
All ahead, 2/3!

689
00:43:25,756 --> 00:43:27,189
Set depth to 900 meters!

690
00:43:27,258 --> 00:43:29,192
What is it?
What's happened?

691
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:31,318
Mast secured, helm at 2/3.

692
00:43:32,929 --> 00:43:35,329
Commence heading 2-0-5.

693
00:43:35,398 --> 00:43:37,832
2-0-5, affirmative.

694
00:43:51,147 --> 00:43:54,014
These orders
are seven bloody hours old!

695
00:43:54,084 --> 00:43:55,551
Sitting on the bottom

696
00:43:55,619 --> 00:43:57,018
Iike an addled schoolboy.

697
00:43:57,087 --> 00:43:58,054
Captain--

698
00:43:58,121 --> 00:43:59,053
Passing at--

699
00:43:59,122 --> 00:44:00,180
All ahead, flank.

700
00:44:00,257 --> 00:44:01,349
All ahead, flank.

701
00:44:01,424 --> 00:44:03,517
Inquire of the engineer
about the possibility

702
00:44:07,264 --> 00:44:09,198
Seven hours.

703
00:44:09,266 --> 00:44:11,860
The entire fleet is after him.

704
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,399
Leveling at 900 meters.

705
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:23,570
Very well.

706
00:44:23,646 --> 00:44:25,546
Captain, Engineer reports

707
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,708
but not recommended.

708
00:44:40,629 --> 00:44:43,258
Go to 105 on the reactor.

709
00:44:46,169 --> 00:44:47,568
Captain, what is it?

710
00:44:47,637 --> 00:44:49,070
Where are we going?

711
00:44:49,139 --> 00:44:51,733
We're going to
kill a friend, Yevgeni.

712
00:44:52,609 --> 00:44:55,271
We're going to kill Ramius.

713
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:18,398
If you like borscht,
perhaps,

714
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,867
but I've eaten better
in an oiler's galley.

715
00:45:20,936 --> 00:45:22,801
My wife said to the waiter,

716
00:45:22,871 --> 00:45:25,339
''Where did this man
learn to cook,

717
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:26,374
Afghanistan?''

718
00:45:26,442 --> 00:45:29,206
So then we went
on to the Bolshoi,

719
00:45:29,278 --> 00:45:30,472
the ballet,

720
00:45:30,546 --> 00:45:32,741
to see this new girl
as Giselle.

721
00:45:32,815 --> 00:45:34,373
You remember
how beautiful she was.

722
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:36,384
She just married
a factory manager.

723
00:45:36,452 --> 00:45:37,851
Excuse me, Doctor.

724
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,854
Do you have the figures

725
00:45:39,922 --> 00:45:42,890
for the latest batch
of radiation tests?

726
00:45:42,957 --> 00:45:44,015
Now?

727
00:45:44,959 --> 00:45:46,358
Now.

728
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:51,524
Perhaps you could bring
the preceding set as well...

729
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:53,866
for comparison.

730
00:45:54,969 --> 00:45:56,527
Thank you, Doctor.

731
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,050
It will take him some time.

732
00:46:18,127 --> 00:46:20,755
Before we begin, Captain,

733
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:22,228
I'd like to know

734
00:46:22,297 --> 00:46:24,128
exactly what happened
to Putin.

735
00:46:29,303 --> 00:46:32,295
He didn't slip
on his tea, did he?

736
00:46:33,508 --> 00:46:35,908
I don't think I like
your tone, Slavin.

737
00:46:35,977 --> 00:46:39,413
What the hell's my tone
got to do with it?

738
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,913
We're risking our lives here.

739
00:46:40,982 --> 00:46:43,416
Putin could've caused
complications.

740
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:45,952
Did you think he would
just go away and sulk

741
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:47,954
while we carried out our plans?

742
00:46:48,022 --> 00:46:50,252
Are you saying
he was murdered?

743
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:51,916
My God.

744
00:46:51,993 --> 00:46:53,426
Stop whining, Yuri.

745
00:46:53,494 --> 00:46:54,927
How can you justify murder?

746
00:46:54,996 --> 00:46:56,463
So he was murdered.

747
00:46:56,531 --> 00:46:58,658
The man was a pig,

748
00:46:58,733 --> 00:47:01,497
but it's a decision
we should've all made together.

749
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:03,002
You are not in command here.

750
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:05,937
If the crew finds out,
we could have a mutiny.

751
00:47:06,007 --> 00:47:07,531
What are you talking about?

752
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:09,006
They could kill us all.

753
00:47:09,075 --> 00:47:12,044
Everything that happens
on this ship affects us all.

754
00:47:12,112 --> 00:47:14,513
The Master-At-Arms
is already suspicious.

755
00:47:14,582 --> 00:47:16,015
We could still go back.

756
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,313
There will be no going back.

757
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:21,820
Before we sailed,

758
00:47:21,889 --> 00:47:26,155
I dispatched a letter
to Admiral Padorin,

759
00:47:26,227 --> 00:47:28,787
in which I announced
our intention...

760
00:47:28,863 --> 00:47:30,421
to defect.

761
00:47:31,999 --> 00:47:34,934
In the name of God, why?

762
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:37,436
When he reached the New World,

763
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:39,939
Cortez burned his ships.

764
00:47:40,007 --> 00:47:43,568
As a result, his men
were well motivated.

765
00:47:43,644 --> 00:47:46,442
You have signed
our death warrants.

766
00:47:46,514 --> 00:47:49,483
Padorin will send
the entire fleet.

767
00:47:49,550 --> 00:47:50,949
Jesus, they'll find us.

768
00:47:51,018 --> 00:47:52,314
They'll find us and--

769
00:47:52,385 --> 00:47:54,148
No one's going to find us.

770
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:55,779
That's enough, Yuri.

771
00:47:57,023 --> 00:47:58,684
You had to do it, huh?

772
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:01,693
You couldn't just
turn the submarine over

773
00:48:01,761 --> 00:48:03,194
to the Americans.

774
00:48:03,263 --> 00:48:06,198
You had to make
a political statement.

775
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:09,793
Or was it something
deeper, Captain--

776
00:48:09,870 --> 00:48:13,670
something that made you
unable to slip away?

777
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,504
Was it ego, Captain?

778
00:48:16,576 --> 00:48:19,511
We each have
our reasons, Victor.

779
00:48:19,579 --> 00:48:20,978
My own began

780
00:48:21,047 --> 00:48:25,006
the day I was handed
the blueprints for this ship--

781
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:28,020
a ship which had but one use.

782
00:48:28,088 --> 00:48:29,989
And as for the rest,

783
00:48:30,057 --> 00:48:32,992
well, those are things
that I alone

784
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:34,994
must carry the burden for.

785
00:48:35,062 --> 00:48:39,521
Anatoli,
you're afraid of our fleet.

786
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,464
Well, you should be.

787
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:45,835
Personally, I give us
one chance in three.

788
00:48:49,576 --> 00:48:51,703
More tea, anyone?

789
00:48:54,714 --> 00:48:56,409
No?

790
00:48:57,584 --> 00:49:00,849
Then you may report
back to your posts.

791
00:49:17,637 --> 00:49:20,366
You heard the Captain.
Dismissed.

792
00:49:29,648 --> 00:49:31,343
Captain.

793
00:49:43,128 --> 00:49:45,596
Captain, I would never
disagree with you

794
00:49:45,664 --> 00:49:48,566
in front of the men,
you know that.

795
00:49:48,635 --> 00:49:52,071
But in this case,
Victor is right.

796
00:49:52,973 --> 00:49:54,440
It would've been better

797
00:49:54,507 --> 00:49:56,907
if you had not informed Moscow.

798
00:49:56,977 --> 00:49:58,137
Oh, Vasily.

799
00:49:58,211 --> 00:50:00,805
Moscow is not the worry,

800
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:03,439
nor the whole Soviet Navy.

801
00:50:03,515 --> 00:50:05,949
I know their tactics.

802
00:50:06,018 --> 00:50:08,282
I have the advantage.

803
00:50:10,022 --> 00:50:11,284
No.

804
00:50:12,191 --> 00:50:14,785
The worry is the Americans.

805
00:50:16,061 --> 00:50:18,825
If we meet the right sort,

806
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:21,127
this will work.

807
00:50:23,535 --> 00:50:27,471
We get some buckaroo...

808
00:50:32,077 --> 00:50:34,511
Some turbulence,
eh, Commander?

809
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:37,014
You don't like flying, huh?

810
00:50:37,082 --> 00:50:38,481
Oh, this is nothing!

811
00:50:38,550 --> 00:50:39,983
You should've been with us

812
00:50:40,052 --> 00:50:41,485
five, six months ago!

813
00:50:41,553 --> 00:50:43,111
Oh! You talk about puke!

814
00:50:43,188 --> 00:50:46,122
We ran into a hailstorm
over the sea of Japan, right?

815
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:48,385
Everybody's retching
their guts out!

816
00:50:48,459 --> 00:50:50,484
The pilot shot his lunch

817
00:50:50,561 --> 00:50:51,493
all over the windshield,

818
00:50:51,562 --> 00:50:53,996
and I barf on the radio!

819
00:50:54,065 --> 00:50:55,191
Knocked it out completely,

820
00:50:55,266 --> 00:50:57,234
and it wasn't
that lightweight stuff either!

821
00:50:57,301 --> 00:50:59,792
It was that chunky,
industrial-weight puke!

822
00:50:59,871 --> 00:51:01,361
You want a bite?

823
00:51:01,439 --> 00:51:04,409
Jack, next time
you get a bright idea,

824
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:07,343
just put it in a memo.

825
00:51:15,954 --> 00:51:16,943
Sir.

826
00:51:17,022 --> 00:51:18,421
[Knocks On Door]

827
00:51:18,490 --> 00:51:21,050
That'll be all, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

828
00:51:21,126 --> 00:51:23,094
That hawkeye
from Weymouth Trap?

829
00:51:23,162 --> 00:51:24,060
Four wire.

830
00:51:24,129 --> 00:51:26,597
Caught a gust over the fantail.

831
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:28,064
Well, not bad, considering.

832
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:31,101
The gentleman
is here to see you.

833
00:51:31,169 --> 00:51:32,227
The gentleman?

834
00:51:32,303 --> 00:51:34,032
What the hell
you talking about, Charlie?

835
00:51:34,105 --> 00:51:36,005
I apologize
for the uniform, sir.

836
00:51:36,074 --> 00:51:37,666
This is Admiral Greer's idea

837
00:51:37,742 --> 00:51:39,141
of a low profile.

838

You work for Jim Greer?

00:51:41,179 --> 00:51:42,646
That's right, sir.

840
00:51:42,714 --> 00:51:45,114
Then I imagine you'll tell me

841
00:51:45,183 --> 00:51:46,980
what all the hubbub's about.

842
00:51:48,086 --> 00:51:50,020
Captain, you got a minute?

843
00:51:50,088 --> 00:51:51,521
Jonesy's got something

844
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:53,489
I think you ought to see.

845
00:51:53,558 --> 00:51:55,856
Martinez, get yourself
a cup of coffee.

846
00:51:55,927 --> 00:51:57,622
Send me up some tea.

847
00:51:57,695 --> 00:51:58,662
Aye, Captain.

848
00:51:58,730 --> 00:52:02,530

get the captain a cup of tea.

Captain.

850
00:52:07,605 --> 00:52:10,540
Sir, the moment
that sub went silent

851
00:52:10,608 --> 00:52:13,007
and I thought I
heard some singing,

852
00:52:13,076 --> 00:52:15,544
I heard something
in the background real faint.

853
00:52:15,612 --> 00:52:17,546
After all those subs took off,

854
00:52:17,614 --> 00:52:21,051
I caught it again
and got it on tape.

855
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,053
I washed it through the computer

856
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:25,589
and was able to
isolate this sound.

[Slow Pulsing]

858
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:30,059
When I asked the computer
to identify it,

859
00:52:30,128 --> 00:52:32,562
what I got was
magma displacement.

860
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,064
You see, sir,
the SAPS software

861
00:52:35,133 --> 00:52:38,068
was originally written
to look for seismic events.

862
00:52:38,136 --> 00:52:40,104
I think when it gets confused,

863
00:52:40,171 --> 00:52:42,401
it kind of runs home to Mama.

864
00:52:42,473 --> 00:52:43,872
I'm not following you,
Jonesy.

865
00:52:43,941 --> 00:52:45,465
Sir, I'm sorry.

866
00:52:45,543 --> 00:52:49,070
Listen to it
at 10 times speed.

Now, that's got to
be manmade, Captain.

869
00:52:59,589 --> 00:53:00,385
All right.

870
00:53:02,726 --> 00:53:05,160
The first contact was at 09:15,

871
00:53:05,228 --> 00:53:07,128
and the bearing was 2-6-9.

872
00:53:07,197 --> 00:53:09,188
At 09:30, it was here.

873
00:53:09,266 --> 00:53:12,702
I came back to it at 11:00
and 11:15, here and here.

874
00:53:12,769 --> 00:53:14,703
Remember the dispatch we got

875
00:53:14,771 --> 00:53:16,068
about Russian sub skippers

876
00:53:16,139 --> 00:53:18,630
running the Reykjanes Ridge
at high speeds

877
00:53:18,708 --> 00:53:20,573
because they had
hyper-accurate surveys

878
00:53:20,644 --> 00:53:22,111
of the underwater canyons?

879
00:53:22,179 --> 00:53:24,079
The front door to those canyons

880
00:53:24,147 --> 00:53:26,581
was a formation
called Thor's Twins.

881
00:53:26,650 --> 00:53:27,844
Yeah?

882
00:53:40,664 --> 00:53:41,995
Look at that.

883
00:53:44,534 --> 00:53:46,126
Right into Red Route One.

884
00:53:46,203 --> 00:53:47,101
Captain.

885

You may think I'm crazy,

886
00:53:50,173 --> 00:53:52,107
but I'll bet that
magma displacement

887
00:53:52,175 --> 00:53:54,609
was actually some
new Russian sub,

888
00:53:54,678 --> 00:53:56,873
and it's headed
for the lceland coast.

889
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:01,650
Have I got this straight,
Jonesy?

890
00:54:01,718 --> 00:54:05,620
A $40 million computer tells you
you're chasing an earthquake,

891
00:54:05,689 --> 00:54:07,122
but you don't believe it,

892
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:10,626
and you come up
with this on your own?

893
00:54:10,694 --> 00:54:11,786
Yes, sir.

894
00:54:11,862 --> 00:54:13,295
Including all the navigation math?

Sir, l-l've got all the--

Relax, Jonesy. You sold me.

897
00:54:18,368 --> 00:54:22,304
Tommy, I want you
to plot us a speed course

898
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:25,306
for the bottom end
of Red Route One.

899
00:54:25,374 --> 00:54:27,467
We'll never find him
in those canyons.

900
00:54:27,543 --> 00:54:29,807
First take us
to periscope depth.

901
00:54:29,879 --> 00:54:31,073
This we got to phone in.

902
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:33,307
Aye, aye, Captain.

903
00:54:41,924 --> 00:54:43,653
Hang on, Jonesy.

904
00:54:48,397 --> 00:54:51,162
If I can get you close enough,

905
00:54:51,234 --> 00:54:52,758
can you track this sucker?

906
00:54:52,836 --> 00:54:54,497
Yes, sir.

907
00:54:54,571 --> 00:54:57,506
Now that I know
what to listen for,

908
00:54:57,574 --> 00:54:59,166
I'll bag him.

909
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:01,335
Carry on.

910
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:02,639
Yes, sir.

911
00:55:04,214 --> 00:55:06,374
That's the craziest notion
I've ever heard--

912
00:55:06,448 --> 00:55:07,540
a serving line officer?

913
00:55:07,616 --> 00:55:09,550
An entire ballistic
missile submarine?

914
00:55:09,618 --> 00:55:11,085
They can't all want to defect.

915
00:55:11,153 --> 00:55:13,053
Even if it's only the officers,

916
00:55:13,122 --> 00:55:14,589
it's extremely
difficult to believe.

917
00:55:14,657 --> 00:55:16,056
What's his plan?

918
00:55:16,125 --> 00:55:17,319
His plan?

919
00:55:17,393 --> 00:55:19,827
Russians don't take a dump, son,

920
00:55:19,895 --> 00:55:21,760
without a plan.

921
00:55:21,830 --> 00:55:24,594
Senior captains don't start
something this dangerous

922
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:26,362
without having thought
the matter through.

923
00:55:26,435 --> 00:55:27,527
What's he going to do,

924
00:55:27,603 --> 00:55:30,731
sail into New York, pop the hatch,
and say here I am?

925
00:55:30,806 --> 00:55:32,774
It might be just
that simple, yes.

926
00:55:32,841 --> 00:55:35,002
Things may appear simple
in the cubicle at CIA,

927
00:55:35,077 --> 00:55:37,341
but in the middle
of the Atlantic

928
00:55:37,413 --> 00:55:39,779
with Soviet warships
bearing down on us,

929
00:55:39,848 --> 00:55:41,179
they get more complex.

930
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,217
Smoke?

931
00:55:42,284 --> 00:55:44,377
No, thank you.

932
00:55:44,453 --> 00:55:46,250
And I don't think your notion

933
00:55:46,322 --> 00:55:48,756
of a few days inspection's
going to wash either.

934
00:55:48,824 --> 00:55:51,257
In order to be of any value,

935
00:55:51,326 --> 00:55:52,793
you'd have to tear it apart.

936
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:54,452
The metallurgy would
take a couple of months.

937
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:55,791
Then we'd have to keep it.

938
00:55:55,863 --> 00:55:59,299
What will you do with the crew?

939
00:55:59,367 --> 00:56:03,633
Ones that don't defect will go back
and say we got the boat.

940
00:56:03,705 --> 00:56:05,730
Or do you plan
to eliminate them?

941
00:56:06,976 --> 00:56:09,001
We're not at war, sir.

942
00:56:09,078 --> 00:56:13,174
So you have to get them
off the boat in such a way

943
00:56:13,248 --> 00:56:15,182
that they think we don't have it,

944
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:18,742
and they'll report that
we don't have it to their bosses.

945
00:56:18,821 --> 00:56:20,186
Otherwise, this whole business

946
00:56:20,255 --> 00:56:22,189
is just academic, right?

947
00:56:23,759 --> 00:56:26,660
Yes, sir.
I think I see your point.

948
00:56:28,297 --> 00:56:30,561
When's the last time you slept?

949
00:56:32,801 --> 00:56:34,165
A while.

950
00:56:35,269 --> 00:56:37,863
The chief outside
will fix you up.

951
00:56:37,939 --> 00:56:39,406
Thank you, sir.

952
00:56:39,474 --> 00:56:40,964
Captain.

953
00:56:45,913 --> 00:56:48,347
It'll be dawn
in a couple of hours.

954
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:49,781
We'll be in the CIC.

955
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:53,082
Things are liable to get
a little dicey around here.

956
00:56:54,389 --> 00:56:55,981
Yes, sir.

957
00:57:03,631 --> 00:57:05,428
You think he's crazy?

958
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,660
Certifiable.

959
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:08,361
No matter what
his credentials,

960
00:57:08,436 --> 00:57:11,337
I don't care for him
wearing the uniform.

961
00:57:11,406 --> 00:57:13,772
Did you see that ring
on his finger?

962
00:57:13,841 --> 00:57:16,775
The academy, class of '72.
A marine.

963
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:17,935
You're kidding.

964
00:57:18,011 --> 00:57:19,478
How did you--

965
00:57:19,546 --> 00:57:20,945
Greer told me.

966
00:57:21,014 --> 00:57:22,676
Summer of his third year,

967
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:25,150
he went down
in a chopper accident.

968
00:57:25,219 --> 00:57:27,153
Bad. Pilot and crew killed.

969
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:30,156
That kid spent
10 months in traction

970
00:57:30,224 --> 00:57:33,193
and another year
learning to walk again.

971
00:57:33,261 --> 00:57:35,889
He did his fourth year
from the hospital.

972
00:57:36,898 --> 00:57:38,832
It's up to you, Charlie,

973
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:42,700
but you might consider
cutting the kid a little slack.

974
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:45,671
Ah, Russians are
going to find that sub

975

977
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:14,027
Very good.

978
00:58:19,005 --> 00:58:20,905
Passing the twins now,

979
00:58:20,974 --> 00:58:22,874
Very good.

Course 2-6-0, aye.

995
00:58:51,838 --> 00:58:52,930
Speed, 18 knots.

996
00:58:53,006 --> 00:58:54,439
Speed, 18 knots, aye.

997
00:58:54,508 --> 00:58:55,941
Stop pissing, Yuri.

998
00:58:56,009 --> 00:58:58,273
Give me a stopwatch and a map,

999
00:58:58,345 --> 00:58:59,778
and I'll fly the Alps

1000
00:58:59,846 --> 00:59:01,279
in a plane with no windows.

1001
00:59:01,348 --> 00:59:03,942
If the map is accurate enough.

1002
00:59:25,005 --> 00:59:27,939
We're in the lane
and approaching first turn.

1003
00:59:28,007 --> 00:59:32,307
Come left to course 1-9-5.

1004
00:59:32,378 --> 00:59:34,312
In 30 seconds,

1005
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:36,280
decrease depth to 200 meters.

1006
00:59:36,348 --> 00:59:37,815
Maintain speed.

1007
00:59:37,883 --> 00:59:39,441
Very good, Navigator.

1008
00:59:41,353 --> 00:59:43,821
Captain, we're approaching
the first turn.

1009
00:59:43,889 --> 00:59:46,289
25 seconds to course 1-9-5.

1010
00:59:46,358 --> 00:59:49,191
Increase speed to 26 knots
and recompute.

1011
00:59:52,364 --> 00:59:53,798
Aye, Captain.

1012
00:59:55,368 --> 00:59:58,462
Navigator, recompute
for 26 knots.

1013
00:59:59,906 --> 01:00:01,840
Turn on my mark.

1014
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:07,312
5...4...3...2...1...

1015
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:08,312
Mark.

1016
01:00:08,381 --> 01:00:10,314
Diving control,
come left to 1-9-5.

1017
01:00:10,382 --> 01:00:11,815
Come left to 1-9-5.

1018
01:00:11,884 --> 01:00:13,078
Up on the bow planes.

1019
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:22,756
Course now 1-9-5

1020
01:00:22,828 --> 01:00:26,264
and maintaining speed
26 knots.

1021
01:00:30,202 --> 01:00:32,136
Mr. Kamarov?

1022
01:00:32,204 --> 01:00:34,104
Next leg, Captain,

1023
01:00:34,173 --> 01:00:38,610
come right
to course 2-4-0 now at...

1024
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,645
8 minutes and 40 seconds.

1025
01:00:40,713 --> 01:00:43,773
Very good.
Maintain course and speed.

1026
01:00:47,186 --> 01:00:49,120
Too fast, Vasily.

1027
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:50,155
Too fast.

1028
01:00:50,222 --> 01:00:53,123
Those charts are
laid out precisely--

1029
01:00:53,192 --> 01:00:56,126
so many knots
for so many seconds.

1030
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,628
And this thing
handles like a pig.

1031
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:01,130
Watch your bearing,
Mr. Slavin.

1032
01:01:07,438 --> 01:01:09,633
15 seconds to turn, Captain.

1033
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:11,300
Should we decrease speed?

1034
01:01:11,377 --> 01:01:12,344
Negative.

1035
01:01:12,411 --> 01:01:14,777
Prepare to come right.

1036
01:01:14,847 --> 01:01:16,007
Aye, sir.

1037
01:01:16,081 --> 01:01:17,013
8...

1038
01:01:17,082 --> 01:01:18,106
7...

1039
01:01:18,183 --> 01:01:19,115
6...

1040
01:01:19,184 --> 01:01:20,173
5...

1041
01:01:20,252 --> 01:01:21,184
4...

1042
01:01:21,253 --> 01:01:22,185
3...

1043
01:01:22,254 --> 01:01:23,152
2...

1044
01:01:23,222 --> 01:01:24,655
1...Mark.

1045
01:01:24,723 --> 01:01:27,191
15 degrees down angle
on the bow planes.

1046
01:01:27,259 --> 01:01:29,489
Come right 2-4-0.

1047
01:01:29,561 --> 01:01:30,858
Move it!

1048
01:01:50,281 --> 01:01:51,646
We're in the lane.

1049
01:01:51,716 --> 01:01:54,844
Next leg 34 minutes
to the Neptune Massif.

1050
01:01:54,919 --> 01:01:57,854
Course 2-4-0.

1051
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,856
[Boom]

1052
01:02:10,335 --> 01:02:11,700
What happened?

1053
01:02:12,637 --> 01:02:14,036
The cryogenic plant!

1054
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:15,538
The magnets aren't cooling.

1055
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,039
Temperature in
the caterpillar

1056
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:20,043
is 15 degrees above red line
and rising.

1057
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,543
It's going to melt.

1058
01:02:21,611 --> 01:02:23,875
Kill it! Shut it down!

1059
01:02:28,319 --> 01:02:29,752
Captain?

1060
01:02:29,821 --> 01:02:30,719
What happened?

1061
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,722
The cryogenic plant failed.

1062
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,054
Reactor damage?

1063
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:36,718
There was a power spike,

1064
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:38,591
but the reactor
scrammed automatically.

1065
01:02:38,663 --> 01:02:40,654
Was there any
radiation leakage?

1066
01:02:40,732 --> 01:02:42,199
I don't know yet!

1067
01:02:42,266 --> 01:02:44,393
How long will it take to fix?

1068
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:46,733
I got to find
what's wrong first.

1069
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,898
Could be the liquid helium
or the superconductors.

1070
01:02:51,175 --> 01:02:52,733
Captain, we will have to stop

1071
01:02:52,810 --> 01:02:55,244
until we can repair
the caterpillar unit.

1072
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,907
Negative.
We'll run on normal propulsion.

1073
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:01,750
Captain,
we will not be silent.

1074
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:03,843
Make revolutions for 20 knots

1075
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,912
and engage the propellers.

1076
01:03:10,327 --> 01:03:11,794
Aye, Captain.

1077
01:03:11,862 --> 01:03:13,420
Commence engine start-up.

1078
01:03:13,497 --> 01:03:15,761
He'll get us all killed.

1079
01:03:20,837 --> 01:03:23,431
The captain knows
what he's doing.

1080
01:03:24,341 --> 01:03:25,433
Doctor.

1081
01:03:28,498 --> 01:03:30,295
Naval activities?

1082
01:03:30,367 --> 01:03:32,597
I have no knowledge of this.

1083
01:03:32,669 --> 01:03:35,035
But then,
I never was a sailor.

1084
01:03:35,105 --> 01:03:36,834
Mr. Ambassador,

1085
01:03:36,907 --> 01:03:39,341
you have nearly
100 vessels operating

1086
01:03:39,409 --> 01:03:41,434
in the North Atlantic
right now.

1087
01:03:41,511 --> 01:03:43,571
Your aircraft have dropped
enough sonar buoys

1088
01:03:43,648 --> 01:03:46,913
that a man could walk
from Greenland to Scotland

1089
01:03:46,984 --> 01:03:48,746
without getting his feet wet.

1090
01:03:48,818 --> 01:03:50,683
Shall we dispense with the bull?

1091
01:03:50,754 --> 01:03:52,187
You make your point

1092
01:03:52,255 --> 01:03:56,453
as delicately as ever,
Mr. Pelt, but--

1093
01:03:56,526 --> 01:03:58,824
And what looks like an exercise

1094
01:03:58,895 --> 01:04:00,795
could be a prelude to war.

1095
01:04:00,864 --> 01:04:02,195
How can we tell the difference?

1096
01:04:02,265 --> 01:04:06,201
Prudence demands that we
deploy ships to observe yours.

1097
01:04:06,269 --> 01:04:07,793
Your government should consider

1098
01:04:07,871 --> 01:04:11,307
that having
your ships and ours,

1099
01:04:11,374 --> 01:04:13,308
your aircraft and ours,

1100
01:04:13,376 --> 01:04:17,813
in such proximity
is inherently dangerous.

1101
01:04:17,881 --> 01:04:21,612
Wars have begun that way,
Mr. Ambassador.

1102
01:04:30,260 --> 01:04:33,194
We have lost
one of our submarines.

1103
01:04:33,262 --> 01:04:34,194
Lost it?

1104
01:04:34,263 --> 01:04:37,198
We fear she may be down, and...

1105
01:04:37,266 --> 01:04:38,824
this is most embarrassing, but...

1106
01:04:38,901 --> 01:04:42,337
several of the officers
are sons of...

1107
01:04:42,404 --> 01:04:45,737
high party officials.

1108
01:04:45,808 --> 01:04:47,742
One is even the son

1109
01:04:47,810 --> 01:04:49,744
of a Central Committee member.

1110
01:04:49,812 --> 01:04:51,677
I cannot say which.

1111
01:04:51,747 --> 01:04:55,877
You're telling me this is
a massive rescue operation?

1112
01:04:55,951 --> 01:04:57,943
That is correct.

1113
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:02,892
I'm terribly sorry.

1114
01:05:02,959 --> 01:05:04,722
How can we help?

1115
01:05:06,963 --> 01:05:08,590
I'm not sure that...

1116
01:05:08,665 --> 01:05:11,600
Perhaps a joint rescue mission?

1117
01:05:14,436 --> 01:05:17,405
That is very gracious of you, sir.

1118
01:05:17,473 --> 01:05:20,374
I'll pass your offer on.

1119
01:05:20,442 --> 01:05:21,875
But at this time,

1120
01:05:21,944 --> 01:05:23,878
I think we're doing everything

1121
01:05:23,946 --> 01:05:25,607
that can be done.

1122
01:05:43,499 --> 01:05:45,126
Captain?

1123
01:05:48,737 --> 01:05:51,535
Our strategy depends
on your answer.

1124
01:05:51,607 --> 01:05:54,542
The entire fleet
will know where we are.

1125
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:55,736
Captain, Sonar.

1126
01:05:55,811 --> 01:05:59,075
We've been overflown
by a multi-engine turboprop.

1127
01:05:59,147 --> 01:06:01,206
Put it on audio.

1128
01:06:04,619 --> 01:06:06,519
Short transients,
close aboard.

1129
01:06:07,789 --> 01:06:09,757
Water entry of small objects.

1130
01:06:09,824 --> 01:06:11,553
Sonar buoys.

1131
01:06:12,994 --> 01:06:13,927
Battle stations.

1132
01:06:13,996 --> 01:06:15,588
Battle stations!

1133
01:06:15,664 --> 01:06:16,596
Battle stations!

1134
01:06:16,665 --> 01:06:17,597
Battle stations!

1135
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,725
How long to Neptune Massif?

1136
01:06:21,703 --> 01:06:23,102
How long?

1137
01:06:23,172 --> 01:06:26,505
4 minutes, 10 seconds.

1138
01:06:26,575 --> 01:06:28,099
Should we bottom the boat?

1139
01:06:28,177 --> 01:06:29,644
No. Too late now.

1140
01:06:29,711 --> 01:06:32,441
We've run out of time.

1141
01:06:32,514 --> 01:06:33,503
Countermeasures.

1142
01:06:33,582 --> 01:06:34,981
Prepare to launch missiles.

1143
01:06:35,050 --> 01:06:36,517
Aye, sir.

1144
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,426
Aircraft on computer guidance.

1145
01:06:46,494 --> 01:06:48,121
Request permission to launch.

1146
01:06:48,196 --> 01:06:51,324
You are authorized
to launch the weapon.

1147
01:06:53,568 --> 01:06:55,729
[Radio]
Weapon is away.

1148
01:06:59,474 --> 01:07:00,907
High speed screw!

1149
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:02,567
Torpedo in the water!

1150
01:07:02,643 --> 01:07:04,167
Stand by.

1151
01:07:05,513 --> 01:07:07,003
Torpedo is active.

1152
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:11,577
Torpedo has acquired.

1153
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:13,381
Launch countermeasures.

1154
01:07:13,454 --> 01:07:15,081
Launch countermeasures.
Aye, sir.

1155
01:07:21,429 --> 01:07:22,828
We're in the lane.

1156
01:07:22,897 --> 01:07:25,763
How long till
the turn at Massif?

1157
01:07:25,832 --> 01:07:26,924
2 minutes, 9 seconds.

1158
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,095
We have no room to maneuver
in these canyons.

1159
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,604
Shut up.

1160
01:07:36,544 --> 01:07:38,944
Torpedo has reached
countermeasures.

1161
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:40,446
Torpedo has lost contact.

1162
01:07:40,515 --> 01:07:42,608
Massif approaching.

1163
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:47,617
Torpedo has reacquired.

1164
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:51,488
Torpedo has reacquired
and is homing.

1165
01:07:51,559 --> 01:07:52,992
Give me the count.

1166
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:56,461
Turn at Massif 40 degrees starboard
in 30 seconds.

1167
01:07:56,531 --> 01:07:58,556
Time to torpedo impact?

1168
01:07:58,633 --> 01:08:00,692
Torpedo impact, 35 seconds.

1169
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:02,429
Increase to flank.

1170
01:08:02,503 --> 01:08:03,470
Full ahead flank.

1171
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:04,664
Full ahead flank.

1172
01:08:04,739 --> 01:08:05,967
Full ahead flank, aye.

1173
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,337
Torpedo impact now 40 seconds.

1174
01:08:09,709 --> 01:08:11,609
35 seconds.

1175
01:08:19,119 --> 01:08:20,643
30 seconds.

1176
01:08:21,588 --> 01:08:23,556
Turn at Massif in...

1177
01:08:23,623 --> 01:08:25,523
7...

1178
01:08:25,592 --> 01:08:27,025
6...

1179
01:08:27,093 --> 01:08:28,526
5...

1180
01:08:28,595 --> 01:08:29,527
4...

1181
01:08:29,596 --> 01:08:31,029
3...

1182
01:08:31,097 --> 01:08:32,189
2...

1183
01:08:32,265 --> 01:08:33,163
1...

1184
01:08:33,233 --> 01:08:34,165
Mark.

1185
01:08:34,234 --> 01:08:35,861
Torpedo impact 25 seconds.

1186
01:08:35,936 --> 01:08:37,028
The turn, Captain.

1187
01:08:37,103 --> 01:08:38,092
Not yet.

1188
01:08:41,208 --> 01:08:43,301
Mark plus 8 seconds...

1189
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:44,400
plus 9...

1190
01:08:44,477 --> 01:08:45,705
plus 10 seconds...

1191
01:08:45,779 --> 01:08:47,907
plus 11...plus 12...

1192
01:08:47,982 --> 01:08:49,415
plus 13 seconds...

1193
01:08:49,483 --> 01:08:50,415
plus 14...

1194
01:08:50,484 --> 01:08:51,882
plus 15 seconds.

1195
01:08:51,952 --> 01:08:55,888
Captain, we're out of position
by a boat length.

1196
01:08:55,956 --> 01:08:58,447
Torpedo impact now 15 seconds.

1197
01:08:58,525 --> 01:09:00,686
Sound collision.

1198
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:01,818
Sound collision.

1199
01:09:01,895 --> 01:09:03,624
We're out of the lane!

1200
01:09:03,697 --> 01:09:05,164
You're relieved.

1201
01:09:05,232 --> 01:09:06,563
Borodin?

1202
01:09:12,339 --> 01:09:13,636
Right full rudder!

1203
01:09:13,707 --> 01:09:14,696
Reverse starboard engine!

1204
01:09:14,774 --> 01:09:15,706
Right full rudder.

1205
01:09:15,775 --> 01:09:16,935
All back starboard shaft.

1206
01:09:17,010 --> 01:09:18,705
All back starboard shaft!

1207
01:09:21,748 --> 01:09:24,410
Torpedo impact 12 seconds...

1208
01:09:24,484 --> 01:09:27,453
10...9...8...

1209
01:09:27,520 --> 01:09:31,547
7...6...5...

1210
01:10:01,553 --> 01:10:04,148
Captain, they're
really shooting at us!

1211
01:10:04,224 --> 01:10:05,156
Pull yourself together!

1212
01:10:05,225 --> 01:10:07,750
Boy! Easy, boy.

1213
01:10:07,827 --> 01:10:10,921
If they were really
shooting at us,

1214
01:10:10,997 --> 01:10:12,931
we'd be dead by now.

1215
01:10:12,999 --> 01:10:14,933
Give me some line.

1216
01:10:31,850 --> 01:10:34,876
I found out what happened
to the caterpillar.

1217
01:10:34,953 --> 01:10:38,354
The buffer circuit
has been torn out.

1218
01:10:38,424 --> 01:10:41,359
It was only a matter of time

1219
01:10:41,427 --> 01:10:43,657
before an overload
shut it down.

1220
01:10:43,729 --> 01:10:45,356
What are you saying?

1221
01:10:45,431 --> 01:10:48,366
Whoever did this knew how
to cripple the caterpillar

1222
01:10:48,434 --> 01:10:50,402
in a way not easy to find.

1223
01:10:50,469 --> 01:10:53,529
Captain,
we have a saboteur on board.

1224
01:10:57,443 --> 01:11:00,378
It can't be any of the officers.

1225
01:11:00,446 --> 01:11:03,414
They had plenty of time
before we embarked.

1226
01:11:03,481 --> 01:11:05,415
Must be a crew member.

1227
01:11:05,483 --> 01:11:06,882
Go to Putin's cabin.

1228
01:11:06,951 --> 01:11:09,886
Check his files
for information on the crew.

1229
01:11:09,954 --> 01:11:14,015
We may have to put them off
before we planned.

1230
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,953
The average Russky, son,
don't take a dump

1231
01:11:19,031 --> 01:11:20,555
without a plan.

1232
01:11:22,501 --> 01:11:24,059
Wait a minute.

1233
01:11:25,471 --> 01:11:28,907
We don't have to get
the crew off the sub.

1234
01:11:28,974 --> 01:11:31,442
He would have had to do that.

1235
01:11:31,510 --> 01:11:35,913
We just have to figure out
what he's going to do.

1236
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:38,848
How is he going
to get them off the sub?

1237
01:11:39,985 --> 01:11:43,921
They'd have to want to get off.

1238
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:46,456
How do you get a crew

1239
01:11:46,524 --> 01:11:50,016
to want to get off a submarine?

1240
01:11:50,094 --> 01:11:52,062
How do you get them
to want to get off

1241
01:11:52,130 --> 01:11:53,654
a nuclear sub...

1242
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:56,393
I know how he's going
to evacuate the sub.

1243
01:11:56,467 --> 01:11:57,866
Not now, Jack.

1244
01:11:57,935 --> 01:12:00,870
Yankee One star base,
say again status.

1245
01:12:00,938 --> 01:12:02,371
Declare an emergency.

1246
01:12:02,440 --> 01:12:04,374
Declare an emergency.

1247
01:12:04,442 --> 01:12:05,909
Yankee One,
requesting vectors.

1248
01:12:05,977 --> 01:12:08,878
Vector 2-7-0 speed is buster.

1249
01:12:08,946 --> 01:12:11,380
Yankee One's
losing hydraulic pressure.

1250
01:12:11,449 --> 01:12:13,144
Say again, Yankee One.

1251
01:12:13,217 --> 01:12:15,777
Bear Foxtrot got too close
to the group.

1252
01:12:15,853 --> 01:12:19,414
One of the F-14s crowded him,
and they bumped.

1253
01:12:19,490 --> 01:12:20,923
He's losing hydraulic fluid.

1254
01:12:20,992 --> 01:12:24,257
They're trying to get him
back aboard now.

1255
01:12:24,328 --> 01:12:25,795
Busy morning.

1256
01:12:25,863 --> 01:12:27,490
Hmm.

1257
01:12:27,565 --> 01:12:32,797
Russian attack subs are now stationed
off every East Coast port.

1258
01:12:32,869 --> 01:12:34,770
We're up here.

1259
01:12:34,839 --> 01:12:37,774
The New Jersey
is moving up the coast

1260
01:12:37,842 --> 01:12:41,278
while the Russians,
aside from over 100 bear foxtrots,

1261
01:12:41,345 --> 01:12:44,781
have a row of subs
and several surface groups.

1262
01:12:44,849 --> 01:12:46,248
That's a lot of firepower.

1263
01:12:46,317 --> 01:12:48,182
For a rescue team, yes.

1264
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:49,685
There's something else strange.

1265
01:12:49,754 --> 01:12:52,780
They're using sonar as if
they're looking for something,

1266
01:12:52,857 --> 01:12:54,290
but nobody's listening.

1267
01:12:54,358 --> 01:12:55,791
What do you mean?

1268
01:12:55,860 --> 01:12:59,489
At their speed they could
run over my daughter's stereo

1269
01:12:59,564 --> 01:13:01,054
and not hear it.

1270
01:13:02,066 --> 01:13:04,000
They're not searching
for Ramius.

1271
01:13:04,068 --> 01:13:05,501
They're driving him.

1272
01:13:05,570 --> 01:13:07,128
Driving him where?

1273
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,274
The hounds to the hunters.

1274
01:13:13,343 --> 01:13:16,312
Your sub captain's going
to make it to America.

1275
01:13:16,379 --> 01:13:19,815
He's going to die
within sight of it.

1276
01:13:19,883 --> 01:13:23,819
His wing man kept requesting
permission to fire.

1277
01:13:23,887 --> 01:13:27,254
Somebody messes up, we'll be
in the biggest naval battle

1278
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:29,758
since the Jutland.
Jesus!

1279
01:13:30,894 --> 01:13:33,362
Water's too cold to eject him.

1280
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,990
Air boss will try
to bring him aboard.

1281
01:13:36,066 --> 01:13:38,864
Sir, what's this sub
off by herself?

1282
01:13:38,935 --> 01:13:40,163
Bart Mancuso's boat.

1283
01:13:40,237 --> 01:13:43,695
He's going to the bottom
of Red Route One.

1284
01:13:43,773 --> 01:13:45,172
He's had intermittent contact

1285
01:13:45,242 --> 01:13:48,643
with a magma displacement.
He's got this--

1286
01:13:48,712 --> 01:13:49,679
Magma displacement?

1287
01:13:49,746 --> 01:13:51,874
Is that like a seismic anomaly?

1288
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:53,849
I suppose so. Why?

1289
01:13:53,918 --> 01:13:57,683
Is there a way you could
get me onboard the Dallas?

1290
01:13:57,754 --> 01:13:59,085
What for?

1291
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:01,623
I think Mancuso's found
the Red October.

1292
01:14:01,691 --> 01:14:03,591
He hasn't found anything, Jack.

1293
01:14:03,660 --> 01:14:05,093
He's just waiting.

1294
01:14:05,161 --> 01:14:07,061
Sir, this silent propulsion system

1295
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:09,621
could easily be mistaken
for something--

1296
01:14:09,699 --> 01:14:13,328
The only way to get you
that far north

1297
01:14:13,403 --> 01:14:17,772
is to use a chopper turned
into a flying gas can.

1298
01:14:17,841 --> 01:14:20,241
Admiral, Yankee One
is on final.

1299
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:22,244
Rescue personnel
are in place.

1300
01:14:22,312 --> 01:14:24,246
Pick up your left wing.

1301
01:14:24,314 --> 01:14:25,747
You're drifting left.

1302
01:14:25,815 --> 01:14:27,248
Power, power!

1303
01:14:27,317 --> 01:14:29,046
Wave off, wave off!

1304
01:14:29,119 --> 01:14:31,246
Eject, eject, eject!

1305
01:14:41,330 --> 01:14:42,297
Fire, fire!

1306
01:14:42,364 --> 01:14:44,958
Fire on the flight deck!

1307
01:14:45,034 --> 01:14:47,969
This business will
get out of control,

1308
01:14:48,037 --> 01:14:51,131
and we'll be lucky
to live through it.

1309
01:14:52,875 --> 01:14:54,775
Fire on the flight deck.

1310
01:14:54,843 --> 01:14:56,936
All hands lend assistance.

1311
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:05,786
The bird's loaded down
with enough fuel to get you there,

1312
01:15:05,854 --> 01:15:07,846
but Dallas may not be there.

1313
01:15:07,924 --> 01:15:09,619
We're trying to reach her.

1314
01:15:09,693 --> 01:15:11,354
If she's gone deep,
it's dodgey.

1315
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:13,988
If you have to ditch...

1316
01:15:20,870 --> 01:15:22,837
If you have to ditch,

1317
01:15:22,905 --> 01:15:25,533
don't think about anything
but the survival gear.

1318
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:26,973
At this water's temperature,

1319
01:15:27,042 --> 01:15:28,805
you'll have about four minutes.

1320
01:15:28,877 --> 01:15:30,811
I'll try to remember that.

1321
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:37,484
Next time, Jack,
write a goddamn memo.

1322
01:16:02,378 --> 01:16:05,347
Diving Officer,
make your depth 6-5-0 feet.

1323
01:16:05,414 --> 01:16:07,847
Make my depth 6-5-0 feet.

1324
01:16:07,915 --> 01:16:10,850
Sonar, Conn preceding
below the thermal layer.

1325
01:16:10,918 --> 01:16:12,351
The captain's sacked out?

1326
01:16:12,420 --> 01:16:13,352
Yeah.

1327
01:16:13,421 --> 01:16:16,356
Auxiliaries
proceed 5,000 pounds.

1328
01:16:16,424 --> 01:16:17,857
What about him?

1329
01:16:17,925 --> 01:16:19,392
He won't leave.

1330
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:20,791
Conn. Sonar, hold.

1331
01:16:20,862 --> 01:16:24,663
No contacts on bearing 2-9-5.

1332
01:16:29,071 --> 01:16:30,504
You know...

1333
01:16:30,572 --> 01:16:33,336
I seen me a mermaid once.

1334
01:16:33,409 --> 01:16:37,311
I've even seen me
a shark eat a octopus,

1335
01:16:37,379 --> 01:16:40,837
but I ain't never seen
no phantom Russian submarine.

1336
01:17:00,134 --> 01:17:04,036
[Slow Pulsing]

1337
01:17:18,486 --> 01:17:20,886
We're emerging
from the route, Captain.

1338
01:17:20,955 --> 01:17:23,423
I've ordered a routine clearing
of the baffles.

1339
01:17:23,491 --> 01:17:27,257
We'll be making the first turn
in a few minutes.

1340
01:17:28,196 --> 01:17:29,754
The caterpillar is operational

1341
01:17:29,831 --> 01:17:32,924
and appears to be
running normally.

1342
01:17:34,668 --> 01:17:37,796
The crew know about the saboteur.

1343
01:17:37,871 --> 01:17:39,737
They are afraid.

1344
01:17:41,209 --> 01:17:44,372
Well, that could be useful
when the time comes.

1345
01:17:47,515 --> 01:17:51,952
You know, we could make
the Labrador Coast in 16 hours.

1346
01:17:52,019 --> 01:17:56,456
Half of them would freeze
before they were rescued.

1347
01:17:56,524 --> 01:17:59,493
No, it's Massachusetts
or Maine...

1348
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:01,391
in 48 hours.

1349
01:18:01,462 --> 01:18:03,487
Two days.

1350
01:18:10,438 --> 01:18:14,204
Do you think they will
let me live in Montana?

1351
01:18:21,748 --> 01:18:26,879
I would think they'll
let you live wherever you want.

1352
01:18:27,921 --> 01:18:29,354
Good.

1353
01:18:29,422 --> 01:18:32,391
Then I will live in Montana,

1354
01:18:32,459 --> 01:18:35,394
and I will marry
a round American woman

1355
01:18:35,462 --> 01:18:37,020
and raise rabbits,

1356
01:18:37,097 --> 01:18:40,362
and she will cook them for me,

1357
01:18:40,433 --> 01:18:43,527
and I will have a pickup truck...

1358
01:18:44,771 --> 01:18:46,033
or a...

1359
01:18:47,274 --> 01:18:51,370
possibly even
a recreational vehicle

1360
01:18:51,444 --> 01:18:55,575
and drive from state to state.

1361
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:58,918
Do they let you do that?

1362
01:18:58,986 --> 01:18:59,917
Yes.

1363
01:18:59,986 --> 01:19:01,283
No papers?

1364
01:19:01,354 --> 01:19:02,878
No papers.

1365
01:19:02,956 --> 01:19:04,617
State to state.

1366
01:19:04,691 --> 01:19:06,852
All right.
Commence your turn.

1367
01:19:10,597 --> 01:19:12,189
Well, then...

1368
01:19:12,265 --> 01:19:16,361
in winter I will live
in Arizona.

1369
01:19:17,604 --> 01:19:20,835
Actually, I think
I will need two wives.

1370
01:19:20,907 --> 01:19:23,068
Oh, at least.

1371
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:35,246
Possible aspect change
on target.

1372
01:19:35,322 --> 01:19:36,755
Sonar, Conn. Aye.

1373
01:19:36,823 --> 01:19:39,883
Concur possible target zig
based on bearing rate.

1374
01:19:42,928 --> 01:19:44,486
Conn! Sonar! Crazy lvan!

1375
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:46,030
All stop! Quick quiet!

1376
01:19:46,098 --> 01:19:47,497
All stop, aye.

1377
01:19:47,566 --> 01:19:49,193
Engine's all stopped.

1378
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:56,504
What's going on, Jonesy?

1379
01:19:56,575 --> 01:19:58,907
Russian captains
sometimes turn suddenly

1380
01:19:58,978 --> 01:20:01,913
to see if anyone's behind them.

1381
01:20:01,981 --> 01:20:03,915
We call it Crazy lvan.

1382
01:20:03,983 --> 01:20:06,884
The only thing
you can do is go dead,

1383
01:20:06,952 --> 01:20:10,514
shut everything down, and make
like a hole in the water.

1384
01:20:10,590 --> 01:20:12,217
So what's the catch?

1385
01:20:12,292 --> 01:20:14,385
Catch is a boat this big

1386
01:20:14,461 --> 01:20:16,395
doesn't exactly stop on a dime.

1387
01:20:16,463 --> 01:20:17,896
If we're too close,

1388
01:20:17,964 --> 01:20:20,489
we'll drift right
into the back of him.

1389
01:20:23,803 --> 01:20:27,568
What about you?
What do you look forward to?

1390
01:20:37,850 --> 01:20:39,408
I...

1391
01:20:39,485 --> 01:20:41,919
I have no such appetites.

1392
01:20:43,322 --> 01:20:46,587
Now, let's see if he can hear us.

1393
01:20:51,497 --> 01:20:54,398
Well, there must be something.

1394
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,432
What is it?

1395
01:21:04,376 --> 01:21:06,105
Ahh.

1396
01:21:07,513 --> 01:21:11,448
I miss...
the peace of fishing

1397
01:21:11,516 --> 01:21:14,781
Iike when I was a boy.

1398
01:21:17,522 --> 01:21:20,889
40 years I have been at sea.

1399
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:24,318
A war at sea.

1400
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,900
A war with no battles.

1401
01:21:30,469 --> 01:21:32,061
No monuments.

1402
01:21:34,173 --> 01:21:35,902
Only casualties.

1403
01:21:39,812 --> 01:21:42,906
I widowed her
the day I married her.

1404
01:21:46,318 --> 01:21:50,812
My wife died while I
was at sea, you know.

1405
01:22:09,340 --> 01:22:11,774
Post guards
in the engineering spaces.

1406
01:22:11,843 --> 01:22:14,277
If he can get
to the caterpillar,

1407
01:22:14,345 --> 01:22:17,576
he can get to somewhere
more vital.

1408
01:22:19,851 --> 01:22:21,910
Where is he, Jonesy?

1409
01:22:21,986 --> 01:22:23,112
Conn, Sonar.

1410
01:22:23,187 --> 01:22:26,350
Target is now coming out
of our starboard baffles.

1411
01:22:26,424 --> 01:22:29,757
My read is that he
is returning to base course.

1412
01:22:29,827 --> 01:22:33,228
Concur. He's returning
to course 2-1-0.

1413
01:22:33,297 --> 01:22:35,891
He went right around us.

1414
01:22:35,967 --> 01:22:38,400
We'll give him
another 30 seconds,

1415
01:22:38,468 --> 01:22:41,232
then secure from silent running.

1416
01:22:42,173 --> 01:22:43,231
Captain?

1417
01:22:44,308 --> 01:22:47,402
Here's what we got
on the E.L.F.

1418
01:22:48,312 --> 01:22:49,244
Thanks.

1419
01:22:49,313 --> 01:22:50,575
Aye, sir.

1420
01:22:57,989 --> 01:22:59,581
What is it?

1421
01:23:02,026 --> 01:23:05,393
You're not going
to believe this.

1422
01:23:17,542 --> 01:23:19,510
Commander,
we are approaching no return.

1423
01:23:19,577 --> 01:23:21,373
Dallas apparently
hasn't gotten the message.

1424
01:23:21,445 --> 01:23:23,845
We have to turn back
for the carrier.

1425
01:23:23,914 --> 01:23:25,677
Give it a couple more minutes.

1426
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:28,013
Negative. Fuel status
says we turn around now.

1427
01:23:28,085 --> 01:23:30,553
Fuel status?
You got a reserve, don't you?

1428
01:23:30,620 --> 01:23:32,349
I've got a 10-minute reserve,

1429
01:23:32,422 --> 01:23:35,289
but I'm not allowed to invade that
except during war.

1430
01:23:35,358 --> 01:23:37,588
If you don't get me
on that submarine,

1431
01:23:37,661 --> 01:23:38,855
you might have it.

1432
01:23:38,929 --> 01:23:41,124
You got 10 minutes
worth of fuel.

1433
01:23:41,198 --> 01:23:43,632
We stay here 10 more minutes.

1434
01:23:48,105 --> 01:23:49,697
Yo! Mount up!

1435
01:23:49,773 --> 01:23:51,900
Yo, I got a submarine
at around 3:00.

1436
01:23:51,975 --> 01:23:53,465
About 2 miles.

1437
01:23:55,445 --> 01:23:57,276
OK, Tony, hook him up.

1438
01:23:57,347 --> 01:24:00,511
I'll be lowering you down
to the submarine now.

1439
01:24:00,585 --> 01:24:01,984
Give me eight minutes.

1440
01:24:02,053 --> 01:24:05,488
Let's hope this thing
runs on fumes.

1441
01:24:05,555 --> 01:24:07,580
Very well.
Surface the ship.

1442
01:24:07,657 --> 01:24:09,056
Whoever this guy is,

1443
01:24:09,126 --> 01:24:11,458
he's in for one hell of a ride.

1444
01:24:11,528 --> 01:24:15,225
OK, Commander,
go ahead and sit down.

1445
01:24:15,298 --> 01:24:17,232
You ever do this before?

1446
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:19,564
Once. On a calm day...
off Hawaii.

1447
01:24:19,636 --> 01:24:22,400
The pilot will have
a difficult time keeping steady.

1448
01:24:22,472 --> 01:24:23,905
Don't take chances
getting grounded.

1449
01:24:23,974 --> 01:24:25,908
Keep that rod in front of you.

1450
01:24:25,976 --> 01:24:27,238
In air like this,

1451
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:29,437
the rotors will put out
enough static electricity

1452
01:24:29,513 --> 01:24:30,775
to light up Chicago.

1453
01:24:30,847 --> 01:24:32,280
That's why I joined the Navy.

1454
01:24:32,349 --> 01:24:34,112
A diver's in the escape trunk

1455
01:24:34,184 --> 01:24:36,414
in case this guy
goes in the drink.

1456
01:24:36,486 --> 01:24:38,818
Someone must have
a burr up his ass

1457
01:24:38,889 --> 01:24:40,789
to go for a stunt like this.

1458
01:24:59,175 --> 01:25:01,268
All right. Ready! Ready!

1459
01:25:01,343 --> 01:25:03,834
Get your hook up!

1460
01:25:03,913 --> 01:25:06,939
Commander, if I got
to bring you back up,

1461
01:25:07,016 --> 01:25:09,041
I'm going to shake the wire.

1462
01:25:09,118 --> 01:25:12,178
I'll give you a thumbs up,
like this.

1463
01:25:12,254 --> 01:25:14,246
Remember to cross your arms.

1464
01:25:14,324 --> 01:25:17,452
Got it? OK. Out you go.
Passenger's out the door.

1465
01:25:24,401 --> 01:25:27,165
Passenger's halfway down,
drifting forward.

1466
01:25:27,237 --> 01:25:28,363
Start forward.

1467
01:25:32,474 --> 01:25:35,807
All right, Tommy.
Get the hook on his cable.

1468
01:25:35,878 --> 01:25:37,812
On his cable. Now, watch it.

1469
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,144
Don't touch him.
OK, here he comes.

1470
01:25:45,221 --> 01:25:46,882
Oh, no!

1471
01:25:46,956 --> 01:25:49,584
It would be easier
without that bloody crosswind.

1472
01:25:49,658 --> 01:25:51,558
Where is he?
I can't see him.

1473
01:25:53,729 --> 01:25:54,991
Don't touch him!

1474
01:25:56,432 --> 01:25:58,525
Jack! Jack! Jack!

1475
01:26:00,436 --> 01:26:02,427
This is never going to work.

1476
01:26:02,504 --> 01:26:04,096
OK, reel him back in.

1477
01:26:12,314 --> 01:26:14,281
Tony, what's going on back--

1478
01:26:18,786 --> 01:26:21,687
What happened? Dallas,
have you got a swimmer standing?

1479
01:26:21,756 --> 01:26:23,223
Emergency stop! Man overboard!

1480
01:26:23,291 --> 01:26:26,419
Port side!
Send out the diver!

1481
01:26:26,494 --> 01:26:29,054
Very well, Dallas.
We are history.

1482
01:26:37,973 --> 01:26:39,702
Get the doc down here!

1483
01:26:39,775 --> 01:26:42,243
I'll be in the escape trunk.

1484
01:26:45,147 --> 01:26:48,708
Down ladder! Down ladder!
Make a hole!

1485
01:26:51,620 --> 01:26:54,088
Watch his head.
Watch his head.

1486
01:26:54,156 --> 01:26:55,885
[Coughing]

1487
01:27:04,799 --> 01:27:06,733
How do you do, Captain?

1488
01:27:06,801 --> 01:27:08,894
It's a pleasure to be aboard.

1489
01:27:12,006 --> 01:27:14,497
I have to talk to the President.

1490
01:27:15,677 --> 01:27:19,443
Of course.
May I inquire as to the subject?

1491
01:27:20,748 --> 01:27:23,239
It seems that the initial reports

1492
01:27:23,318 --> 01:27:26,287
that one of our submarines
was missing

1493
01:27:26,354 --> 01:27:27,821
were not completely accurate.

1494
01:27:29,757 --> 01:27:31,691
The submarine in question

1495
01:27:31,759 --> 01:27:35,160
is commanded
by Captain Marko Ramius.

1496
01:27:35,229 --> 01:27:37,390
Apparently, he has suffered

1497
01:27:37,465 --> 01:27:40,865
a kind of mental
nervous breakdown.

1498
01:27:42,269 --> 01:27:44,396
Just before he sailed,

1499
01:27:44,471 --> 01:27:47,873
he posted a letter
to Admiral Yuri Padorin

1500
01:27:47,942 --> 01:27:51,378
in which he announced
his intention to...

1501
01:27:53,448 --> 01:27:56,815
to fire his missiles
on the United States.

1502
01:27:56,884 --> 01:28:00,650
Why didn't you tell me this
the last time we met?

1503
01:28:00,722 --> 01:28:02,815
In my position
I'm sometimes compromised

1504
01:28:02,890 --> 01:28:06,053
by the fact Moscow doesn't
always tell me everything.

1505
01:28:06,127 --> 01:28:09,494
So one of your submarine captains
has gone insane?

1506
01:28:09,564 --> 01:28:11,828
What do you want from us?

1507
01:28:11,899 --> 01:28:13,332
You offered your assistance.

1508
01:28:13,401 --> 01:28:14,834
That was a rescue mission.

1509
01:28:14,902 --> 01:28:16,836
Now you want us to help you

1510
01:28:16,904 --> 01:28:18,872
hunt him down and kill him.

1511
01:28:18,940 --> 01:28:20,339
I have been instructed

1512
01:28:20,408 --> 01:28:23,639
to ask your President
for precisely that.

1513
01:28:24,611 --> 01:28:26,977
Find him?
We already found him.

1514
01:28:27,047 --> 01:28:29,345
We had to break off
to pick you up.

1515
01:28:29,416 --> 01:28:30,883
Captain, excuse me.
Coffee?

1516
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:31,883
Thank you.

1517
01:28:31,952 --> 01:28:32,884
Cigarette?

1518
01:28:32,953 --> 01:28:33,851
Don't smoke.

1519
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,820
Assuming we can find him,

1520
01:28:35,889 --> 01:28:39,347
just what exactly
am I supposed to do about it?

1521
01:28:39,426 --> 01:28:40,450
Captain, radio.

1522
01:28:40,527 --> 01:28:41,858
We're receiving
flash traffic

1523
01:28:41,928 --> 01:28:43,896
on the V.L.F.
emergency circuit.

1524
01:28:43,964 --> 01:28:46,023
Very well. Bring it down.

1525
01:28:47,434 --> 01:28:49,197
Well, Mr. Ryan?

1526
01:28:51,938 --> 01:28:54,372
Chief, excuse us for a second.

1527
01:28:54,441 --> 01:28:57,035
Leonard,
come on out of there.

1528
01:29:02,483 --> 01:29:05,941
The sub we're after
is called the Red October.

1529
01:29:06,020 --> 01:29:08,715
She's under the command
of a man named Ramius.

1530
01:29:08,789 --> 01:29:10,051
Now, there's the possibility

1531
01:29:10,123 --> 01:29:12,921
that he and a good
portion of his crew

1532
01:29:12,993 --> 01:29:14,551
are attempting to defect.

1533
01:29:16,963 --> 01:29:18,225
Defect?

1534
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:21,228
Excuse me.

1535
01:29:37,484 --> 01:29:40,419
You say the boat's
called the Red October?

1536
01:29:40,487 --> 01:29:41,419
That's right.

1537
01:29:41,488 --> 01:29:42,455
Skipper's Ramius?

1538
01:29:42,522 --> 01:29:43,716
Right.

1539
01:29:44,825 --> 01:29:46,258
It seems the circumstances

1540
01:29:46,326 --> 01:29:48,419
have changed somewhat,
Mr. Ryan.

1541
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:57,298
Get this man some dry clothes.

1542
01:29:57,369 --> 01:29:59,132
I'll be in the conn.

1543
01:29:59,205 --> 01:30:00,763
Aye, aye, sir.

1544
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,432
''National Command Authority

1545
01:30:02,508 --> 01:30:05,136
informed Soviet typhoon class
submarine Red October

01:30:05,211 --> 01:30:06,678

and threatens
independent missile launch.

from approaching

the coast
of the United States.''

1552
01:30:30,537 --> 01:30:33,973
Left 10 degrees rudder
steady on course 2-6-5.

1553
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:38,066
Left 10 degrees rudder
secure course of 2-6-5.

1554
01:30:38,143 --> 01:30:39,974
Make turns for 14 knots.

1555
01:30:40,045 --> 01:30:42,809
Chief of the watch,
rig for red.

1556
01:30:45,384 --> 01:30:46,646
Time Quartermasters
and Navigator

1557
01:30:46,719 --> 01:30:49,313
on the deck in the conn.

1558
01:30:52,458 --> 01:30:53,789
What's going on?

1559
01:30:53,859 --> 01:30:56,327
Battle stations
are manned and ready.

1560
01:30:56,395 --> 01:30:57,293
Very well.

1561
01:30:57,363 --> 01:30:59,831
Captain, I have to talk to you.

1562
01:30:59,899 --> 01:31:00,627
Not now.

1563
01:31:00,699 --> 01:31:02,667
Make your depth 1,200 feet,

1564
01:31:02,735 --> 01:31:04,532
20 degrees down angle.

1565
01:31:04,603 --> 01:31:08,334
Diving officer, make your depth
1,200 feet, 20 degree down.

1566
01:31:08,407 --> 01:31:10,807
Full dive
on fair water planes.

1567
01:31:10,876 --> 01:31:12,810
Full dive on stern planes.

1568
01:31:12,878 --> 01:31:14,971
20 degree down.

1569
01:31:18,249 --> 01:31:21,377
Passing 450 feet,
going to 1,200.

1570
01:31:23,388 --> 01:31:24,480
500.

1571
01:31:26,791 --> 01:31:28,224
600.

1572
01:31:30,295 --> 01:31:31,557
700.

1573
01:31:36,335 --> 01:31:38,633
Did you get a good fix?

1574
01:31:38,704 --> 01:31:39,671
Yes, Captain.

1575
01:31:39,738 --> 01:31:40,762
Very well.

1576
01:31:40,839 --> 01:31:43,034
At ordered depth,
1,200 feet.

1577
01:31:47,279 --> 01:31:50,077
Sonar, Conn.
You got him, yet, Jonesy?

1578
01:31:50,149 --> 01:31:52,344
Very faint, sir. Hold on.

1579
01:31:52,418 --> 01:31:56,218
Yes, sir. Contact typhoon seven
on bearing 2-5-0.

1580
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,222
Right where he's supposed to be.

1581
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,724
Any sign he's alerted
to our presence?

1582
01:32:00,793 --> 01:32:02,259
No. Operating as before.

1583
01:32:02,327 --> 01:32:04,227
Come left 2-6-5.

1584
01:32:04,295 --> 01:32:07,230
Bring us up
behind him quietly, Tommy.

1585
01:32:07,298 --> 01:32:08,322
Aye, aye, Captain.

1586
01:32:08,399 --> 01:32:11,061
Diving officer,
make your depth 500 feet.

1587
01:32:20,278 --> 01:32:22,041
Captain, please listen to me.

1588
01:32:22,113 --> 01:32:23,603
Two minutes, that's all.

1589
01:32:25,016 --> 01:32:27,610
Plot, time to intercept his track.

1590
01:32:27,685 --> 01:32:29,482
Four minutes, Captain.

1591
01:32:29,554 --> 01:32:31,647
Very well, Mr. Ryan.

1592
01:32:31,723 --> 01:32:32,985
Two minutes.

1593
01:32:39,664 --> 01:32:43,896
It makes perfect sense.
Look at the situation--

1594
01:32:43,968 --> 01:32:46,561
Ramius intends to defect.
The Russians know this,

1595
01:32:46,637 --> 01:32:48,127
which is why they've
tried to sink him,

1596
01:32:48,205 --> 01:32:50,674
but they haven't been able to.

1597
01:32:50,742 --> 01:32:52,642
I have a firing solution.

1598
01:32:52,710 --> 01:32:55,110
The Russians
will stop at nothing

1599
01:32:55,179 --> 01:32:57,113
to prevent Ramius
from defecting.

1600
01:32:57,181 --> 01:32:59,274
They've invented
this story that he's crazy

1601
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:01,784
because they need us
to sink him

1602
01:33:01,853 --> 01:33:03,753
before he can contact us.

1603
01:33:05,857 --> 01:33:07,916
Weapons control,
I want full safeties.

1604
01:33:07,992 --> 01:33:10,654
I don't want this fish
coming back.

1605
01:33:10,728 --> 01:33:11,820
Full safety.

1606
01:33:11,896 --> 01:33:14,057
Captain, I know this man.

1607
01:33:15,099 --> 01:33:17,693
Has he made any Crazy lvans?

1608
01:33:17,769 --> 01:33:19,202
What difference does that make?

1609
01:33:19,270 --> 01:33:21,864
- The next one will be to starboard.
- 'Cause his last was to port?

1610
01:33:21,939 --> 01:33:24,669
Because he goes to starboard
in the bottom half of the hour.

1611
01:33:29,746 --> 01:33:32,146
Flood tubes one and two.
Warm up the weapons.

1612
01:33:32,215 --> 01:33:35,912
Find a way to establish contact
without violating orders.

1613
01:33:35,986 --> 01:33:37,419
He wants to defect!

1614
01:33:37,487 --> 01:33:39,478
Mr. Thompson,
call Chief Watson

1615
01:33:39,556 --> 01:33:41,353
to the conn with his sidearm.

1616
01:33:45,729 --> 01:33:48,357
Conn, Sonar.
Signal to noise ratio's dropping.

1617
01:33:48,432 --> 01:33:50,525
Possible aspect change
in target.

1618
01:33:50,600 --> 01:33:53,535
Possible target zig
based on bearing rate.

1619
01:33:55,405 --> 01:33:56,804
Conn, Sonar. Crazy lvan!

1620
01:34:00,944 --> 01:34:02,002
Captain.

1621
01:34:03,280 --> 01:34:05,646
Captain, he's turning.

1622
01:34:08,252 --> 01:34:10,277
Which way is he turning?

1623
01:34:10,354 --> 01:34:11,911
To the starboard, sir.

1624
01:34:13,056 --> 01:34:15,456
Give the man a chance.

1625
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:18,860
All back full.

1626
01:34:18,929 --> 01:34:20,362
Captain, say again.

1627
01:34:20,430 --> 01:34:22,398
I said all back full!

1628
01:34:22,466 --> 01:34:23,899
Back full. Aye, sir.

1629
01:34:23,967 --> 01:34:25,059
Engines back full.

1630
01:34:29,906 --> 01:34:31,999
We're cavitating.
He can hear us!

1631
01:34:32,075 --> 01:34:34,441
Conn, aye. All stop.

1632
01:34:34,511 --> 01:34:35,808
All stop, aye.

1633
01:34:35,879 --> 01:34:38,848
All right.
We just unzipped our fly.

1634
01:34:38,915 --> 01:34:41,383
Mr. Thompson,
open the outer doors.

1635
01:34:41,451 --> 01:34:42,884
Firing point procedures.

1636
01:34:42,953 --> 01:34:45,854
Now, if that bastard
so much as twitches,

1637
01:34:45,922 --> 01:34:48,720
I'm going to blow him
right to Mars.

1638
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:50,817
All stop rudder amid ship.

1639
01:34:50,894 --> 01:34:52,327
What's going on?

1640
01:34:52,395 --> 01:34:53,987
Can you identify the contact?

1641
01:34:54,064 --> 01:34:56,497

He may be trying to open
his torpedo tube doors.

Outer doors are open
on tubes one and two.

Very well.
My orders are specific, Mr. Ryan.

1648

He's opened his outer doors.

1649
01:35:13,749 --> 01:35:14,807
He's preparing to fire.

1650
01:35:14,884 --> 01:35:18,411
Flood tubes three and four
and plot a solution.

1651
01:35:18,487 --> 01:35:22,048
Captain, flood tubes three and four.
Plot solution.

1652
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:24,719
Shall I open
the torpedo tube door, sir?

1653

Captain,
shall I open outer doors?

No.

Lock the firing solution
into the computer.

1656

Do not open the doors.

1657

Aye, Captain.

Has he opened his outer doors?

1661
01:35:57,526 --> 01:35:59,960
Negative, Captain.
He's just sitting there.

1662
01:36:00,029 --> 01:36:01,155
Hold on.

1663

Hull popping.
Target's coming shallow.

1664

What's that mean?

1665
01:36:07,403 --> 01:36:09,701
That means he's
a very cool customer,

1666
01:36:09,772 --> 01:36:10,830
your Russian.

1667
01:36:10,906 --> 01:36:13,875
He knows we're here
and ready to shoot.

1668
01:36:13,943 --> 01:36:15,376
He's not provoking us.

1669
01:36:15,444 --> 01:36:17,344
He's heading to periscope depth

1670
01:36:17,413 --> 01:36:19,847
to see what's on the surface.

1671

His course is 2-0-7, due west.

1672
01:36:22,917 --> 01:36:24,384
Bring us alongside him.

1673
01:36:24,452 --> 01:36:25,885
Aye, aye, Captain.

Very well. Fire control,
range to target?

1678

Range is 300 yards.

Make your depth 65 feet.

Diving Officer,
make your depth 65 feet.

1681
01:36:45,441 --> 01:36:48,877
He wants to go up
and take a peek.

1682
01:36:48,944 --> 01:36:50,707
We'll play along.

are flooded.

You wanted to talk
to him, Mr. Ryan.

There he is.

What do you want to say?

1695
01:37:36,590 --> 01:37:38,990
Is he the only one looking?

1696
01:37:39,059 --> 01:37:39,991
Probably.

1697
01:37:40,060 --> 01:37:42,153
We'll have to chance that.

Can he acknowledge
with a single ping?

1705
01:38:01,915 --> 01:38:04,349
Yeah, he can.

1706
01:38:04,418 --> 01:38:06,511

going to go to starboard?

more than 20 minutes below deck.

1807
01:44:36,772 --> 01:44:38,205
Will that be satisfactory?

1808
01:44:38,274 --> 01:44:39,332
Completely, Captain.

1809
01:44:39,408 --> 01:44:40,602
Surface contact!

1810
01:44:40,676 --> 01:44:42,200
2-7-0.

1811
01:44:42,278 --> 01:44:45,076
6 miles and closing fast.

1812
01:44:45,147 --> 01:44:46,341
It's a warship.

1813
01:44:46,415 --> 01:44:47,382
What? Here?

1814
01:44:47,450 --> 01:44:48,849
Can you identify it?

1815
01:44:48,918 --> 01:44:50,351
It's a frigate,

1816
01:44:50,419 --> 01:44:52,046
U.S., probably,

1817
01:44:52,121 --> 01:44:54,021
Perry class.
He's signaling.

1818
01:44:54,924 --> 01:44:58,553
''Red October.
Red October.

1819
01:44:58,627 --> 01:45:00,424
Halt and stay where you are.

1820
01:45:00,496 --> 01:45:02,293
Do not attempt to submerge,

1821
01:45:02,365 --> 01:45:04,559
or you will be fired upon.''

1822
01:45:06,768 --> 01:45:10,226
Captain, I think
he means to board us.

1823
01:45:15,877 --> 01:45:18,311
You will go with the crew.

1824
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:21,315
The officers and I
will submerge beneath you

1825
01:45:21,383 --> 01:45:22,907
and scuttle the ship.

1826
01:45:24,452 --> 01:45:27,546
You'll receive the order of Lenin
for this, Captain.

1827
01:45:37,166 --> 01:45:39,100
We're going to cast off.

1828
01:45:39,168 --> 01:45:42,262
The captain's going
to scuttle the ship.

1829
01:45:47,675 --> 01:45:49,006
He's going down, sir.

1830
01:45:49,077 --> 01:45:50,874
Put a shot across his bow.

1831
01:45:50,945 --> 01:45:52,378
Come right at 1-8-0.

1832
01:46:07,529 --> 01:46:09,588
[Boom]

1833
01:46:22,911 --> 01:46:25,311
Seahawk One,
this is Bravo Command.

1834
01:46:43,864 --> 01:46:45,092
She's ready.

1835
01:46:47,268 --> 01:46:49,668
Seahawk One,
release on my command.

1836
01:46:49,737 --> 01:46:52,900
Drop now...now...now.

1837
01:47:01,015 --> 01:47:03,245
Range to target--
900 yards.

1838
01:47:04,886 --> 01:47:06,080
800 yards.

1839
01:47:08,790 --> 01:47:10,121
700 yards.

1840
01:47:11,826 --> 01:47:13,759
600 yards.

1841
01:47:18,632 --> 01:47:19,894
500 yards.

1842
01:47:22,636 --> 01:47:24,297
400 yards.

1843
01:47:26,340 --> 01:47:28,069
300 yards.

1844
01:47:30,878 --> 01:47:32,573
The torpedo is detonated.

1845
01:47:33,981 --> 01:47:36,347
Now, understand, Commander,

1846
01:47:36,416 --> 01:47:38,816
that torpedo
did not self-destruct.

1847
01:47:38,886 --> 01:47:41,320
You heard it hit the hull.

1848
01:47:41,388 --> 01:47:44,585
And l...was never here.

1849
01:47:44,658 --> 01:47:47,126
Contact Dallas.
Give them the go.

1850
01:47:47,194 --> 01:47:49,754
Advise Dallas.
Get the DSRV moving.

1851
01:47:49,830 --> 01:47:51,798
Dallas, this is Rueben James.

1852
01:47:58,237 --> 01:48:00,000
There are about
two million things

1853
01:48:00,072 --> 01:48:02,837
that can still go wrong
with this stunt.

1854
01:48:02,910 --> 01:48:05,310
Central lntelligence Agency.

1855
01:48:05,379 --> 01:48:07,904
Now, there's
a contradiction in terms.

1856
01:48:09,616 --> 01:48:11,413
How's the coffee, Ryan?

1857
01:48:12,619 --> 01:48:14,587
Dallas, this is the Mystic.

1858
01:48:14,655 --> 01:48:16,088
Request clearance for launch.

1859
01:48:16,156 --> 01:48:18,750
Mystic, Dallas.
You're cleared for launch.

1860
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,193
Hatch is secured.

1861
01:48:21,261 --> 01:48:23,661
Life support, normal.
Prelaunch checks complete.

1862
01:48:23,730 --> 01:48:25,163
We're ready to launch.

1863
01:48:25,232 --> 01:48:26,221
Aye.

1864
01:48:26,300 --> 01:48:27,198
Flood the skirt.

1865
01:48:27,267 --> 01:48:28,598
Flood the skirt. Aye.

1866
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:30,534
Skirt's filled and equalized.

1867
01:48:30,604 --> 01:48:33,038
Soft seal.
Ready to lift off.

1868
01:48:33,106 --> 01:48:35,165
OK. Let's do it.

1869
01:48:36,944 --> 01:48:38,844
We're off.

1870
01:48:38,912 --> 01:48:40,708
Thrusting port.

1871
01:49:01,500 --> 01:49:03,934
600 yards and closing.

1872
01:49:04,003 --> 01:49:06,699
Steer right to course 0-7-5.

1873
01:49:06,772 --> 01:49:07,704
400.

1874
01:49:11,711 --> 01:49:13,645
200 yards.

1875
01:49:16,048 --> 01:49:17,811
100 yards.

1876
01:49:25,191 --> 01:49:26,783
Hit the lights.

1877
01:49:39,972 --> 01:49:43,464
Jesus, that's a big sucker.

1878
01:49:58,924 --> 01:50:01,085
OK, we're in position.

1879
01:50:01,160 --> 01:50:03,856
You can open the hatch.

1880
01:50:03,929 --> 01:50:05,453
Hold it a second.

1881
01:50:05,531 --> 01:50:06,589
Jonesy.

1882
01:50:08,667 --> 01:50:10,066
Mr. Ryan.

1883
01:50:13,371 --> 01:50:15,134
He's defecting.

1884
01:50:16,107 --> 01:50:18,507
And he can't change his mind?

1885
01:50:18,576 --> 01:50:21,044
He's not going
to change his mind.

1886
01:50:21,112 --> 01:50:24,309
You willing
to bet your life on that?

1887
01:50:43,602 --> 01:50:46,127
Uh, sir, could you
hand me that hammer?

1888
01:50:46,205 --> 01:50:47,297
Yeah.

1889
01:51:09,794 --> 01:51:11,056
Americans.

1890
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:17,159
[Speaking Russian]

1891
01:51:35,486 --> 01:51:37,716
[Speaking Russian]

1892
01:52:09,387 --> 01:52:11,252
[Speaking Russian]

1893
01:53:19,790 --> 01:53:21,348
What's so funny?

1894
01:53:22,893 --> 01:53:25,361
Well, the captain
seems to think

1895
01:53:25,429 --> 01:53:27,488
you're some sort of cowboy.

1896
01:53:41,712 --> 01:53:42,940
It is.

1897
01:53:45,248 --> 01:53:46,681
I doubt you'd remember,

1898
01:53:46,749 --> 01:53:50,185
but we met once
at the consulate in Leningrad.

1899
01:53:50,253 --> 01:53:52,448
Along with your wife.

1900
01:53:52,521 --> 01:53:54,079
I'm very sorry.

1901
01:53:56,626 --> 01:54:01,563
What gives you the right
to fire on my ship?

1902
01:54:01,631 --> 01:54:04,429
Your signal said nothing
of a torpedo.

1903
01:54:04,500 --> 01:54:05,660
Ryan.

1904
01:54:07,103 --> 01:54:10,436
It was necessary to maintain
the illusion for your crew.

1905
01:54:10,506 --> 01:54:12,940
My crew are being rescued, yes?

1906
01:54:13,009 --> 01:54:14,738
As we speak.

1907
01:54:18,714 --> 01:54:20,739
You sent the signal.

1908
01:54:20,816 --> 01:54:22,341
That's correct, sir.

1909
01:54:24,087 --> 01:54:28,819
Then how did you know
our reactor accident was false?

1910
01:54:30,293 --> 01:54:33,694
Well, that was a guess,
but it seemed logical.

1911
01:54:40,036 --> 01:54:41,401
Very well.

1912
01:54:45,207 --> 01:54:47,767
I present you

1913
01:54:47,843 --> 01:54:50,869
the ballistic missile
submarine Red October.

1914
01:54:55,084 --> 01:54:58,781
My officers and I
request asylum...

1915
01:54:59,855 --> 01:55:02,449
in the United States
of America.

1916
01:55:04,327 --> 01:55:06,386
It's a pleasure, sir.

1917
01:55:06,462 --> 01:55:08,589
Bart Mancuso, USS Dallas.

1918
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:14,591
Torpedo. The Americans
are shooting at us again.

1919
01:55:14,669 --> 01:55:16,603
The pitch is too high.

1920
01:55:16,671 --> 01:55:18,764
The torpedo's Russian.

1921
01:55:18,840 --> 01:55:21,502
Where the hell
did it come from?

1922
01:55:21,576 --> 01:55:23,771
Conn, Sonar.
New contact. Sierra 4-1.

1923
01:55:23,845 --> 01:55:25,506
Alfa class Soviet submarine.

1924
01:55:29,084 --> 01:55:30,984
Why don't I have a detonation?

1925
01:55:31,052 --> 01:55:34,351
The weapon enabled
on the far side of the target.

1926
01:55:34,422 --> 01:55:36,356
It passed Red October
before arming.

1927
01:55:36,424 --> 01:55:39,826
Fire again with the right settings
and reload both tubes.

1928
01:55:39,895 --> 01:55:42,728
Get me power.
Get that damn thing off my boat.

1929
01:55:42,798 --> 01:55:43,787
It's off.

1930
01:55:44,967 --> 01:55:47,595
I think somebody
shot a torpedo at us.

1931
01:55:47,670 --> 01:55:49,934
No shit, Buckwheat.
Get out of here.

1932
01:55:50,006 --> 01:55:51,064
Where am l--

1933
01:55:51,140 --> 01:55:53,040
[Alarm Sounds]

1934
01:56:05,387 --> 01:56:08,049
Borodin, fire control.

1935
01:56:09,090 --> 01:56:10,114
Uh, Ryan.

1936
01:56:10,191 --> 01:56:11,215
Sit here.

1937
01:56:11,292 --> 01:56:14,386
I'm not a naval officer.
I'm with the CIA.

1938
01:56:14,462 --> 01:56:15,360
CIA?

1939
01:56:15,430 --> 01:56:16,897
I'm not an agent.

1940
01:56:16,965 --> 01:56:19,399
I just write books
for the CIA.

1941
01:56:19,467 --> 01:56:20,934
Whatever. Sit down.

1942
01:56:21,002 --> 01:56:23,061
And do exactly what I tell you.

1943
01:56:23,138 --> 01:56:24,332
DSRVs away.

1944
01:56:24,406 --> 01:56:26,704
There's a Russian alfa
8,000 yards to starboard.

1945
01:56:26,775 --> 01:56:28,538
I think it's the Konovalov.

1946
01:56:28,610 --> 01:56:30,077
Increase the flank.

1947
01:56:30,145 --> 01:56:32,170
Increase the flank.

1948
01:56:32,247 --> 01:56:33,145
How?

1949
01:56:34,315 --> 01:56:37,079
That knob. Turn right full.

1950
01:56:38,419 --> 01:56:40,580
All ahead flank.
Right full rudder.

1951
01:56:40,654 --> 01:56:42,121
He's shooting again, sir.

1952
01:56:42,189 --> 01:56:43,622
Go to battle stations.

1953
01:56:43,690 --> 01:56:44,588
Battle stations.

1954
01:56:44,658 --> 01:56:47,593
Chief of Watch,
man battle stations.

1955
01:56:50,898 --> 01:56:52,866
Torpedo in the water.

1956
01:56:52,933 --> 01:56:54,127
Bearing 3-1-5.

1957
01:56:54,201 --> 01:56:55,499
Make range 7,000 yards.

1958
01:56:55,570 --> 01:56:57,936
Steer right 3-1-5.

1959
01:56:58,006 --> 01:57:00,065
That's heading
into the torpedo.

1960
01:57:00,141 --> 01:57:02,109
Steady,
bearing still 3-1-5.

1961
01:57:02,177 --> 01:57:04,236
Estimated range--
6,000 yards.

1962
01:57:04,312 --> 01:57:05,836
Still 3-1-5.

1963
01:57:05,914 --> 01:57:08,610
Steer right
till this reads 3-1-5.

1964
01:57:08,683 --> 01:57:11,982
No, that's wrong.
Ryan, don't turn that goddamn wheel.

1965
01:57:13,321 --> 01:57:15,289
3-1-5.

1966
01:57:25,899 --> 01:57:28,299
You're heading straight
into that torpedo.

1967
01:57:29,570 --> 01:57:30,935
Yes.

1968
01:57:31,004 --> 01:57:32,232
Doing what?

1969
01:57:32,306 --> 01:57:34,171
He's turned
into the torpedo's path.

1970
01:57:34,241 --> 01:57:35,936
What?

1971
01:57:36,009 --> 01:57:38,978
Red October's turned directly
into the torpedo's path, sir.

1972
01:57:39,046 --> 01:57:40,377
Mother of God.

1973
01:57:40,447 --> 01:57:42,847
Torpedo steady,
bearing 3-1-5.

1974
01:57:42,916 --> 01:57:44,349
Range--5,000 yards.

1975
01:57:44,418 --> 01:57:45,851
Melekhin, more speed.

1976
01:57:50,324 --> 01:57:53,020
Estimate range 3,000 yards.

1977
01:57:53,093 --> 01:57:55,084
Closing awfully fast.

1978
01:58:01,635 --> 01:58:04,126
What's he trying to do,
kill himself?

1979
01:58:04,204 --> 01:58:07,172
We have a firing solution
on the Russian alfa.

1980
01:58:07,240 --> 01:58:08,639
Can we shoot back?

1981
01:58:08,708 --> 01:58:10,175
They didn't shoot at us.

1982
01:58:10,243 --> 01:58:12,644
I can't attack a Soviet submarine
without authorization.

1983
01:58:15,349 --> 01:58:17,476
Torpedo bearing steady at 3-1-5.

1984
01:58:17,551 --> 01:58:20,179
Best range-- 900 yards.

1985
01:58:21,421 --> 01:58:24,822
Torpedo impact...
20 seconds.

1986
01:58:26,593 --> 01:58:27,753
What books?

1987
01:58:29,329 --> 01:58:30,660
Pardon me.

1988
01:58:30,731 --> 01:58:32,289
What books did you write?

1989
01:58:34,067 --> 01:58:38,265
I wrote a biography on Admiral Halsey
called The Fighting Sailor,

1990
01:58:38,338 --> 01:58:40,033
about naval combat tactics.

1991
01:58:40,107 --> 01:58:41,597
I know this book.

1992
01:58:41,675 --> 01:58:42,607
Torpedo impact--

1993
01:58:42,676 --> 01:58:45,110
Your conclusions
were all wrong, Ryan.

1994
01:58:45,179 --> 01:58:46,146
10 seconds.

1995
01:58:46,213 --> 01:58:48,407
Halsey acted stupidly.

1996
01:58:48,481 --> 01:58:49,743
9...

1997
01:58:49,815 --> 01:58:50,907
8...

1998
01:58:50,983 --> 01:58:52,610
7...

1999
01:58:52,685 --> 01:58:53,743
6...

2000
01:58:53,819 --> 01:58:54,786
5...

2001
01:58:54,854 --> 01:58:56,412
4...

2002
01:58:56,489 --> 01:58:57,717
3...

2003
01:58:57,790 --> 01:58:58,688
2...

2004
01:58:58,758 --> 01:59:00,453
Torpedo impact...

2005
01:59:01,594 --> 01:59:02,993
now.

2006
01:59:12,038 --> 01:59:14,404
I'll be damned.

2007
01:59:15,841 --> 01:59:17,365
What happened?

2008
01:59:17,443 --> 01:59:19,911
Combat tactics, Mr. Ryan.

2009
01:59:19,979 --> 01:59:21,913
By turning into the torpedo,

2010
01:59:21,981 --> 01:59:23,915
the captain closed the distance

2011
01:59:23,983 --> 01:59:26,384
before it could arm itself.

2012
01:59:26,453 --> 01:59:28,284
So that's it?

2013
01:59:28,355 --> 01:59:29,481
Not quite.

2014
01:59:29,556 --> 01:59:31,046
Right now, Captain Tupolev

2015
01:59:31,124 --> 01:59:34,524
is removing the safety
features on all his weapons.

2016
01:59:34,594 --> 01:59:37,529
He won't make
the same mistake twice.

2017
01:59:37,597 --> 01:59:40,361
Vasily, have you
plotted a solution yet?

2018
01:59:40,433 --> 01:59:42,924
Aye, Captain.
It's a little rough, but l...

2019
01:59:49,308 --> 01:59:50,400
Gunfire?

2020
01:59:50,476 --> 01:59:52,569
That's what it sounded like, sir.

2021
01:59:52,645 --> 01:59:54,203
Won't change his mind?

2022
01:59:54,280 --> 01:59:55,713
It's one of the crew.

2023
01:59:55,781 --> 01:59:58,682
Well, whoever he is,
he's having second thoughts.

2024
02:00:16,301 --> 02:00:19,395
I would like
to have seen Montana.

2025
02:00:28,813 --> 02:00:29,745
[Beep]

2026
02:00:29,814 --> 02:00:30,940
[Beep]

2027
02:00:31,016 --> 02:00:32,483
[Beep]

2028
02:00:32,550 --> 02:00:35,542
Captain, he stumbled forward
into the missile bay.

2029
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:37,645
There's a silo hatch warning--

2030
02:00:37,722 --> 02:00:39,189
port side, number 20.

2031
02:00:39,257 --> 02:00:40,781
He can't launch a missile.

2032
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:44,125
No, but he can blow one up.

2033
02:00:45,698 --> 02:00:47,131
Captain, take the conn.

2034
02:00:47,199 --> 02:00:48,962
Fire control's blasted to hell.

2035
02:00:49,035 --> 02:00:51,367
Then get behind him
and stay there.

2036
02:00:51,437 --> 02:00:52,426
Captain, wait.

2037
02:00:54,206 --> 02:00:55,969
[Cocks Gun]

2038
02:00:56,042 --> 02:00:58,272
You may need this, sir.

2039
02:01:01,713 --> 02:01:02,941
Thank you.

2040
02:01:05,850 --> 02:01:08,785
Don't just stand there, Ryan.
Go with him!

2041
02:01:08,853 --> 02:01:10,252
You, you speak English?

2042
02:01:10,322 --> 02:01:11,311
Yes, sir.

2043
02:01:11,389 --> 02:01:13,152
Get your butt over here.

2044
02:01:13,224 --> 02:01:15,818
Captain, torpedo
broke off on impact.

2045
02:01:15,894 --> 02:01:18,124
Set the safety ranges
for zero.

2046
02:01:18,196 --> 02:01:19,993
I cannot go any faster.

2047
02:01:20,065 --> 02:01:21,464
We must get him

2048
02:01:21,533 --> 02:01:23,524
before he gets to
the ignition circuits.

2049
02:01:31,710 --> 02:01:35,146
What happens if he gets
to that ignition circuitry?

2050
02:01:35,213 --> 02:01:37,306
He can incinerate the ship.

2051
02:01:45,456 --> 02:01:49,290
Is that door
the only way out of here?

2052
02:01:49,360 --> 02:01:50,554
Yes.

2053
02:01:50,627 --> 02:01:52,993
Don't let him get past you.

2054
02:01:54,131 --> 02:01:55,860
Hey, Ryan.

2055
02:01:55,933 --> 02:01:59,301
Be careful
what you shoot at, hmm?

2056
02:01:59,371 --> 02:02:00,804
Most things in here

2057
02:02:00,872 --> 02:02:03,466
don't react too well
to bullets.

2058
02:02:06,344 --> 02:02:07,606
Right.

2059
02:02:26,196 --> 02:02:29,290
I have to be careful
what I shoot at?

2060
02:02:37,441 --> 02:02:39,306
Safety ranges set to zero.

2061
02:02:39,376 --> 02:02:42,345
Sonar, give me the bearing
for Red October.

2062
02:02:42,413 --> 02:02:43,846
She's positioned behind us.

2063
02:02:43,914 --> 02:02:45,313
Right full rudder!

2064
02:02:45,382 --> 02:02:47,475
I'll shake the man loose.

2065
02:02:53,690 --> 02:02:54,748
He's going deep.

2066
02:02:54,825 --> 02:02:56,315
30 degree down angle!

2067
02:02:56,393 --> 02:02:59,157
All the countermeasures
were over there, right?

2068
02:02:59,229 --> 02:03:00,127
Very well.

2069
02:03:25,656 --> 02:03:27,590
Admiral,
the alfa's too quick.

2070
02:03:27,658 --> 02:03:29,717
It's only a matter of time.

2071
02:03:29,793 --> 02:03:32,455
''Ryan, some things in here

2072
02:03:32,529 --> 02:03:34,394
don't react well to bullets.''

2073
02:03:34,465 --> 02:03:35,329
Yeah.

2074
02:03:35,399 --> 02:03:36,696
Like me.

2075
02:03:36,767 --> 02:03:39,361
I don't react well to bullets.

2076
02:03:55,485 --> 02:03:56,452
Aah!

2077
02:03:57,854 --> 02:03:58,946
Where's he now?

2078
02:03:59,021 --> 02:03:59,919
Close, sir.

2079
02:04:03,626 --> 02:04:05,685
900 meters, directly ahead.

2080
02:04:05,761 --> 02:04:06,785
Got him.

2081
02:04:06,863 --> 02:04:08,330
Match bearings and fire.

2082
02:04:08,397 --> 02:04:09,830
We are too close!

2083
02:04:09,899 --> 02:04:11,799
Don't argue.
Launch the weapon.

2084
02:04:11,868 --> 02:04:14,666
The torpedoes are armed
in the tubes! You cannot--

2085
02:04:14,737 --> 02:04:15,931
Do it now!

2086
02:04:17,373 --> 02:04:20,934
Another torpedo. It went active
the moment it was launched.

2087
02:04:21,010 --> 02:04:24,377
Left full rudder.
Ease off on your bow planes.

2088
02:04:24,447 --> 02:04:25,880
I think he's got us.

2089
02:04:35,626 --> 02:04:37,718
Way to go, Dallas!

2090
02:04:42,932 --> 02:04:44,490
Torpedo is in acquisition.

2091
02:04:44,567 --> 02:04:46,501
Range 500 yards and closing.

2092
02:04:46,569 --> 02:04:48,537
You've done it, Mr. Thompson!

2093
02:04:48,604 --> 02:04:50,003
I hope this works.

2094
02:04:50,072 --> 02:04:52,506
Chief, put us on the roof.

2095
02:04:52,575 --> 02:04:56,204
Countermeasure station,
on my mark. 5, 4--

2096
02:04:59,015 --> 02:05:00,880
1. Release countermeasures.

2097
02:05:00,950 --> 02:05:02,178
Emergency blow!

2098
02:05:02,251 --> 02:05:04,082
Full rise. Fair water plane.

2099
02:05:09,759 --> 02:05:11,021
600 feet.

2100
02:05:11,093 --> 02:05:12,788
550...

2101
02:05:12,862 --> 02:05:14,887
500 feet.

2102
02:05:14,964 --> 02:05:15,862
450...

2103
02:05:15,932 --> 02:05:18,264
Come on, big D. Fly.

2104
02:05:37,385 --> 02:05:38,818
That torpedo's still active.

2105
02:05:38,887 --> 02:05:40,946
It's searching
for another target.

2106
02:06:06,181 --> 02:06:08,274
A goddamn cook!

2107
02:06:08,350 --> 02:06:11,410
[Speaking Russian]

2108
02:06:34,075 --> 02:06:35,133
[Speaking Russian]

2109
02:06:35,210 --> 02:06:36,871
[Speaking Russian]

2110
02:06:36,945 --> 02:06:39,413
How close is that alfa, Jonesy?

2111
02:06:39,481 --> 02:06:41,005
1,000 yards, going to port.

2112
02:06:41,082 --> 02:06:43,141
Reverse your turn.

2113
02:06:48,389 --> 02:06:50,823
We're turning straight at him.

2114
02:06:50,891 --> 02:06:52,688
Torpedo's still on our tail.

2115
02:06:56,597 --> 02:06:59,122
The hard part
about playing chicken

2116
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:01,360
is knowing when to flinch.

2117
02:07:06,808 --> 02:07:08,275
Collision in 400 yards.

2118
02:07:08,343 --> 02:07:09,537
350...

2119
02:07:09,611 --> 02:07:10,703
300...

2120
02:07:10,779 --> 02:07:12,440
Captain!

2121
02:07:12,514 --> 02:07:15,449
Right full rudder,
30 degree down angle.

2122
02:07:15,517 --> 02:07:16,814
Aye, sir.

2123
02:07:16,885 --> 02:07:18,876
This one's going to be close.

2124
02:07:23,191 --> 02:07:24,624
Torpedo dead ahead!

2125
02:07:24,693 --> 02:07:27,025
You arrogant ass.
You've killed us.

2126
02:07:55,055 --> 02:07:57,546
We have ascertained
the Red October's

2127
02:07:57,624 --> 02:07:59,717
final position, but...

2128
02:07:59,793 --> 02:08:01,852
given the depth of the water

2129
02:08:01,929 --> 02:08:03,863
and the fact that the wreckage

2130
02:08:03,931 --> 02:08:05,922
spreads across a wide area,

2131
02:08:05,999 --> 02:08:08,866
it'll be some time before
anything's recovered.

2132
02:08:08,936 --> 02:08:11,871
However, your people
are interviewing the crew now

2133
02:08:11,939 --> 02:08:14,429
and making arrangements
for their return.

2134
02:08:14,507 --> 02:08:17,408
This has been a terrible tragedy,
Mr. Ambassador.

2135
02:08:17,477 --> 02:08:19,412
And I can only stress

2136
02:08:19,480 --> 02:08:22,415
that if you'd come to us earlier

2137
02:08:22,483 --> 02:08:24,417
it might have been avoided.

2138
02:08:24,485 --> 02:08:27,420
I appreciate your candor
in the matter.

2139
02:08:27,488 --> 02:08:29,979
And I yours, Andrei.

2140
02:08:33,527 --> 02:08:34,926
Perhaps in the future

2141
02:08:34,995 --> 02:08:38,055
technology will allow
a more thorough investigation

2142
02:08:38,132 --> 02:08:39,394
of the wreckage.

2143
02:08:39,466 --> 02:08:41,434
Perhaps.

2144
02:08:47,407 --> 02:08:49,534
There is another matter...

2145
02:08:49,610 --> 02:08:51,703
one that I'm reluctant to...

2146
02:08:51,779 --> 02:08:53,974
Please.

2147
02:08:55,015 --> 02:08:57,482
One of our submarines--
an alfa--

2148
02:08:57,550 --> 02:09:01,782
was last reported in the area
of the Grand Banks.

2149
02:09:01,854 --> 02:09:05,381
We have not heard
from her for some time.

2150
02:09:07,960 --> 02:09:09,450
Andrei.

2151
02:09:10,496 --> 02:09:12,862
You've lost another submarine?

2152
02:09:27,313 --> 02:09:31,682
All this way to hide
a submarine in a river.

2153
02:09:31,751 --> 02:09:34,983
We're 100 miles
from the nearest naval base,

2154
02:09:35,055 --> 02:09:38,149
the last place
that satellites will ever look.

2155
02:09:40,259 --> 02:09:42,318
I grew up around here.

2156
02:09:44,230 --> 02:09:46,721
My grandfather taught me to fish

2157
02:09:46,799 --> 02:09:49,324
off that island right over there.

2158
02:09:52,705 --> 02:09:54,138
There's one question

2159
02:09:54,207 --> 02:09:56,300
you haven't asked me yet.

2160
02:09:58,044 --> 02:10:00,103
Why?

2161
02:10:01,714 --> 02:10:05,115
Well, I figured you would tell me
when you were ready.

2162
02:10:06,919 --> 02:10:09,387
Now, there are
those who believe

2163
02:10:09,455 --> 02:10:12,356
we should attack
the United States first,

2164
02:10:12,425 --> 02:10:15,155
settle everything
in one moment.

2165
02:10:15,228 --> 02:10:18,197
Red October was built
for that purpose.

2166
02:10:18,264 --> 02:10:20,698
When the dust settles
from this,

2167
02:10:20,766 --> 02:10:23,734
there's going to be
hell to pay in Moscow.

2168
02:10:23,802 --> 02:10:24,894
Well, perhaps.

2169
02:10:24,970 --> 02:10:27,871
Maybe something good
will come from it.

2170
02:10:27,939 --> 02:10:30,373
A little revolution,
now and then,

2171
02:10:30,442 --> 02:10:33,536
is a healthy thing,
don't you think?

2172
02:10:39,651 --> 02:10:42,051
Do you still like to fish, Ryan?

2173
02:10:42,120 --> 02:10:43,747
Mm-hmm.

2174
02:10:44,823 --> 02:10:47,724
There's a river,
not unlike this one,

2175
02:10:47,792 --> 02:10:48,759
near Vilnius,

2176
02:10:48,827 --> 02:10:51,888
where my grandfather
taught me to fish.

2177
02:10:54,867 --> 02:10:59,600
''And the sea will grant
each man new hope

2178
02:10:59,672 --> 02:11:04,871
as sleep brings dreams of home.''

2179
02:11:09,648 --> 02:11:11,548
Christopher Columbus.

2180
02:11:16,154 --> 02:11:18,748
Welcome to the New World, sir.

2181
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:30,061
Everything all right, sir?
