1
00:04:39,462 --> 00:04:42,465
Hey, Brad! Brad.

2
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:54,143
He took our money.

3
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:57,145
We, we just wanted
a bottle of J.D.

4
00:04:57,146 --> 00:05:00,650
And he said he'd go in and get it
for us if we gave him the money.

5
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:06,155
- How much money? How much? 
- Five dollars. He bought himself a bottle of gin.

6
00:05:12,528 --> 00:05:15,915
- Did you take their money?
- Yeah, I took five dollars.

7
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,418
I was gonna give this to them, but they're
smart-ass kids, and now they're not getting it.

8
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,922
- You'll give it back now? 
- No, I'm not gonna give it back.

9
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:25,174
You're not gonna
give it back to them?

10
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:27,426
No, I'm not, 'cause
this kid's an asshole.

11
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:29,427
- Which one?
- The big one.

12
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,430
- That's my brother. 
- That's your brother?
- Yeah.

13
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:33,432
Oh you gonna take care of him.
Besides he's too young to drink.

14
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:35,433
Give him the money back.

15
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:37,937
I'm not giving him the money back,
and what are you gonna do about it?

16
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,939
Fuck you and fuck them.

17
00:05:43,309 --> 00:05:46,445
- That's what I thought.
- Brad?

18
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:55,453
Do you?

19
00:05:55,454 --> 00:05:57,456
Get off the car, kid.

20
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,578
You wanna play?

21
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:06,082
All right. I can play.

22
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,845
Come on. Get off!
All right, kid!

23
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:22,848
You asked for it!

24
00:06:22,849 --> 00:06:25,601
Faster. Come on.

25
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:27,853
Whoa.

26
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,368
Get off, you nutcase.

27
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,513
All right, kid, come on.
Get off of the car.

28
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:01,520
- What do you want?
- The five.

29
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:08,027
Now get off the car,
all right?

30
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:13,532
Now what do you want?

31
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,035
- The gin.
- I gave you the five.

32
00:07:17,036 --> 00:07:22,541
Hey, man, you know,
we got your license plates.

33
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,082
Now will you get off the car?

34
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:35,588
You're weird, kid.
You know that?

35
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:50,602
That was fucking great, man.

36
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:54,607
- I liked it. 
- Drink your gin, get in the truck.

37
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,610
Don't you want some of this?

38
00:07:57,611 --> 00:07:59,612
Come on, man.

39
00:08:01,197 --> 00:08:04,325
Nice move, man.

40
00:08:09,455 --> 00:08:10,956
Hi.

41
00:08:11,457 --> 00:08:13,459
Hello.

42
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,962
Is this your friend?

43
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:18,964
Yeah, Jill.

44
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:22,468
Jill. Hi, Jill.

45
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:24,470
Hi.

46
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,473
You got a name?

47
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:30,975
Brad?

48
00:08:30,976 --> 00:08:33,979
You don't sound so sure.

49
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,487
Oh, I'm terry.

50
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,990
Terry. Hi.

51
00:08:50,996 --> 00:08:52,998
You have a really nice smile.

52
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,003
Thanks.

53
00:09:14,403 --> 00:09:16,405
Terry doesn't take drugs.

54
00:09:17,406 --> 00:09:19,407
What are they?

55
00:09:19,408 --> 00:09:23,412
I don't really know.
They make things stronger.

56
00:09:23,413 --> 00:09:25,914
What is that supposed to mean?

57
00:09:25,915 --> 00:09:30,419
Whatever you feel, it
makes you feel it stronger.

58
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:47,436
Brad!

59
00:09:47,686 --> 00:09:50,189
Just get her phone number
and come on.

60
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:52,558
Just get her phone number.

61
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:55,059
Who's that?

62
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:58,063
My brother and his partner.
I gotta drive them, i guess.

63
00:10:03,068 --> 00:10:04,570
Will I see you
down here again?

64
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:08,574
I don't know.

65
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:13,078
Well, where
will I see you?

66
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:15,581

67
00:10:16,081 --> 00:10:20,586
Well, I guess I could be
here, like, day after tomorrow.

68
00:10:20,587 --> 00:10:23,087
All right.

69
00:10:23,088 --> 00:10:26,592
Well, I'll see you then.

70
00:10:29,094 --> 00:10:31,096
- Okay.
- Okay.

71
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,099
Bye.

72
00:10:37,987 --> 00:10:41,489
Ooh-Hoo.
Bradford.

73
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:43,993
Did you tell her
your name was Bradford?

74
00:10:44,493 --> 00:10:46,495

75
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,981
"The toyota sr-5.

76
00:11:07,182 --> 00:11:09,184
The truck that feels
like a sports car.

77
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:12,312
o-O-Oh, what a feeling 

78
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,940
to drive... toyota"

79
00:11:16,559 --> 00:11:18,561
Hey, Brad.

80
00:11:20,062 --> 00:11:24,066
You're always trying to go out
with those real pretty women.

81
00:11:25,568 --> 00:11:27,570
All they got is a cunt.

82
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:31,072
They're all the same.

83
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:35,578
They tell you they want you
to... to talk nice...

84
00:11:36,078 --> 00:11:38,330
and act nice.

85
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:40,458
- Hello!
- Yeah, come on in.

86
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,585
All they got is
a goddamned cunt.

87
00:11:58,817 --> 00:12:00,818
What you doing?

88
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:04,189
My truck's all fucked up.

89
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:08,760
Is she home?

90
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:11,830
No. No.

91
00:12:13,832 --> 00:12:15,834
Now who's that?

92
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,960
I wanna give her some money.

93
00:12:24,961 --> 00:12:27,462
- Goddamn.
- Huh?

94
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:29,965
I said,
"she could sure use it."

95
00:12:29,966 --> 00:12:32,468
So, what do you think,
a hundred?

96
00:12:32,968 --> 00:12:35,971
Two, three? What?

97
00:12:38,974 --> 00:12:42,478
- Brad.
- Yeah.

98
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,479
Tommy?

99
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,982
No.

100
00:12:46,983 --> 00:12:48,984
Ah.

101
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:52,488
See ya.

102
00:12:57,993 --> 00:12:59,995
How old are you now,
anyway?

103
00:12:59,996 --> 00:13:02,464
Old enough.

104
00:13:02,965 --> 00:13:04,466
Damn.

105
00:13:29,324 --> 00:13:31,326
Do you know
where he's living at?

106
00:13:31,827 --> 00:13:34,446
I don't care.

107
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:40,953
He's up in homeville.

108
00:13:50,379 --> 00:13:51,880
Little Brad...

109
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,884
don't even think about it.

110
00:15:08,423 --> 00:15:10,425
Is that my beer
you're drinking?

111
00:15:10,926 --> 00:15:14,429
There's a colt 45.
You can't afford it.

112
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:19,434
You know, that shit you guys are
smoking is gonna rot your brains,

113
00:15:19,435 --> 00:15:21,937
But i guess in your case, that
ain't no damage done, is it?

114
00:15:40,823 --> 00:15:44,325
- Why don't you get a job, boy? 
- I tried that.

115
00:15:44,326 --> 00:15:47,830
- You quit as soon as you paid off that
damn pick-up truck, didn't you? 
- That's right.

116
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:50,332
We ain't all got so lucky
around here, you know?

117
00:15:50,799 --> 00:15:52,801
You see your mom in there. She's gotta work
in the morning. Your grandma's gotta work.

118
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:56,255
But more important, I gotta work
tomorrow, and I need some sleep.

119
00:15:56,755 --> 00:15:59,725
You turn that damn thing on again,
and I'll beat the Jesus out of you.

120
00:16:02,227 --> 00:16:04,229
There ain't no Jesus in me.

121
00:16:05,731 --> 00:16:07,733
Go to bed, Tommy.

122
00:16:08,734 --> 00:16:12,737
Look, Ernie.
This here is my house.

123
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:16,742
You lived here four years. Before that
rising sun, six, before that, Jennersville.

124
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:19,244
You've been five months with her.
You don't ever tell me what to do.

125
00:16:19,245 --> 00:16:23,365
Ernie. Ernie!

126
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:26,368
All right, enough.

127
00:16:26,369 --> 00:16:28,370
You little son of a...

128
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:18,387
Yeah, Homeville. Number for
Bradford Whitewood sr., please.

129
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,894
I guess you must have heard
about me or something.

130
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:29,397
I guess.

131
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:31,400
What'd you hear?

132
00:17:33,402 --> 00:17:34,903
I heard you was a thief.

133
00:17:35,404 --> 00:17:37,405
What do you think about that?

134
00:17:37,406 --> 00:17:40,408
Looks like you make
pretty good money at it.

135
00:17:40,409 --> 00:17:43,412
Well, to some folks, I'm just
the devil in blue suede shoes.

136
00:17:43,413 --> 00:17:45,414
Don't you believe it, okay?

137
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:47,415
Okay.

138
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:50,418
I never stole nothing, 
hear?

139
00:17:50,419 --> 00:17:52,421
Yeah. Don't you worry about
getting a speeding ticket?

140
00:17:52,921 --> 00:17:55,424
Kid, you look a thousand
miles any direction...

141
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:58,426
from Tennessee
to Toronto,

142
00:17:58,427 --> 00:18:00,428
I go back roads
just about anyplace.

143
00:18:00,429 --> 00:18:03,932
Never touch the interstate.
Never see one goddamn cop.

144
00:18:03,933 --> 00:18:05,934
Besides, this ain't fast.

145
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:15,444
Hello?

146
00:18:17,946 --> 00:18:19,948
That's my son.

147
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,453
It's Brad.

148
00:18:24,953 --> 00:18:26,955
He'll be staying with us

149
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:29,458
a couple... a few weeks.

150
00:18:30,459 --> 00:18:32,461
This is your uncle Dickie.

151
00:18:33,962 --> 00:18:37,466
- Uncle Patch.
- Hi, kid.

152
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:40,501
That's Boyd.

153
00:18:40,502 --> 00:18:42,971
Tony Pine.
He's epileptic.

154
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:49,961
They're sort of
part of the family.

155
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:54,483
And, uh,
my sister and mother.

156
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,985
That's Mary Sue.

157
00:18:56,986 --> 00:18:58,987
Hi, Brad jr.

158
00:18:59,488 --> 00:19:02,107
Mary sue's about five
years older than you.

159
00:19:04,609 --> 00:19:07,996
- You're own family.
- We're late.

160
00:19:18,006 --> 00:19:21,510
Mary Sue, show him
that room we got.

161
00:19:21,511 --> 00:19:23,512
Hell, he's cute.

162
00:19:25,515 --> 00:19:27,516
See you tomorrow.

163
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,280
I didn't know
you had a son, Brad.

164
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,782
Got two.
Sort of.

165
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:49,287
Old Braddy went to prison. Julie started
dickin' some grease monkey from Willerton.

166
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,290
Nine months later,
out popped Tommy.

167
00:19:55,293 --> 00:19:57,295
What exactly are you saying?

168
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,299
Nothing. Nothing.
I didn't say nothing.

169
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:04,301
Just one thing here.

170
00:20:04,302 --> 00:20:06,805
You don't say nothing
against the family.

171
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:09,306
Okay.

172
00:20:09,307 --> 00:20:11,810
Let's go to work.

173
00:20:13,812 --> 00:20:16,815
So, uh, where'd
they go, anyway?

174
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:34,950
One's coming.

175
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:40,088
Okay, i hear it.

176
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,223
Patch, what's that car?

177
00:21:36,228 --> 00:21:38,230
Brad.

178
00:21:41,733 --> 00:21:43,985
Brad, we lost our lookout. Yo.

179
00:21:44,486 --> 00:21:46,104
I think your brother's out there
pinching hubcaps or something.

180
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,740
I'll stay where I can hear you.

181
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:12,130
- Hundreds?
- Twenties.

182
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:39,541
You remind me of a guy
I knew in high school.

183
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:44,546
Only he was
a real doofus.

184
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,552
Go for a ride?

185
00:22:50,553 --> 00:22:52,553
Sure.

186
00:22:52,554 --> 00:22:57,058
Gimme that foot.
Gimme those little piggies.

187
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,060
Mmm.

188
00:23:04,566 --> 00:23:06,568
Time to do some laundry.

189
00:23:29,591 --> 00:23:31,593
Kid, you like pussy?

190
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:34,595
- Yeah.
- Smart boy.

191
00:23:34,596 --> 00:23:37,098
What's the sexiest thing you ever
thought of in your whole life?

192
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,100
- Excuse me. Can i help you? 
- Yeah.

193
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:42,604
You got- You got, what,
$5,500 on that car?

194
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:47,475
I'll give you five...
cash.

195
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,696
Do I drive her out?

196
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,228
What are we doing here?

197
00:24:23,229 --> 00:24:25,230
Laundry.

198
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:34,739
You know that truck of mine's
gone punk dead.

199
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,743
- I could sure use a slick car sometime. 
- Maybe.

200
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:42,247
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Yeah.

201
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:44,749
I just bought this car...

202
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,751
for 5,500.

203
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:48,752
It's a cherry.

204
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:52,374
- Would you give me 46 for her?
- Why are you selling it?

205
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:55,627
I don't like the radio.

206
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,986
- You're kidding.
- No.

207
00:25:22,487 --> 00:25:25,990
Mom said, "that's my son.
Nobody touches my son."

208
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,493
And she threw his suitcase
down the stairs.

209
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,495
I wish I'd seen that.

210
00:25:31,996 --> 00:25:36,500
Brad, when are you
gonna come home?

211
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,003
I don't know. I'm hoping
dad might give me something.

212
00:25:39,504 --> 00:25:41,506
Yeah? What?

213
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:48,513
Hey, Jill. Jill.
Hey, Terry's friend.

214
00:27:24,859 --> 00:27:28,363
- Hi. 
- Hi.

215
00:27:28,613 --> 00:27:31,616
- You scared the hell out of me. 
- Sorry.

216
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:34,001
Well, thanks for coming out.

217
00:27:34,002 --> 00:27:36,254
I can only stay a minute.

218
00:27:36,754 --> 00:27:39,257
Oh, well, 
your friend Jill,

219
00:27:39,757 --> 00:27:41,759
Didn't know if you wanted
to come out at all.

220
00:27:42,126 --> 00:27:43,878
Jill.

221
00:27:51,019 --> 00:27:53,021
So, you do remember me, huh?

222
00:27:53,271 --> 00:27:57,025
- Sure.
- You were supposed to meet me, you know, that night.

223
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:59,527
I know. 
My mother wouldn't let me out.

224
00:27:59,894 --> 00:28:04,398
And then I tried to sneak out,
and she caught me.

225
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:08,903
- Really? 
- Yeah. She grounded me for two weeks.

226
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,291
She says until I'm 17,
I can only go out...

227
00:28:13,791 --> 00:28:17,912
- You're only 16?
- Yes, so?

228
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:23,668
I thought about
your smile a lot.

229
00:28:23,918 --> 00:28:27,422
I thought about you too.

230
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:34,679
Jill says your last name's Whitewood?

231
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,681
Yeah.

232
00:28:39,183 --> 00:28:41,184
Your father's got kind of a rep.

233
00:28:41,185 --> 00:28:45,005
Well, yeah. Don't believe
everything you hear.

234
00:28:45,006 --> 00:28:48,825
- Terry.
- Oh, shit. I gotta go.

235
00:28:48,826 --> 00:28:54,332
Wait a minute. Jill didn't
give me your number or anything.

236
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:57,334
555-6239.

237
00:28:57,335 --> 00:29:00,337
- 555-6239.
- 39.

238
00:29:00,338 --> 00:29:02,340
- Yeah, okay. 
- Wait. Don't go yet.

239
00:29:02,341 --> 00:29:04,592
Terry?

240
00:29:04,593 --> 00:29:06,844
I gotta go.

241
00:29:18,856 --> 00:29:20,358
Bye.

242
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,330
Ha!

243
00:29:34,789 --> 00:29:38,292
Hey, Patch, how come you
don't go out with them anymore?

244
00:29:40,294 --> 00:29:42,296
The other guys.

245
00:29:43,798 --> 00:29:46,300
'Cause your daddy's a dickface.

246
00:29:46,417 --> 00:29:49,420
Don't want me having no money.

247
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:52,422
Don't want me having no fun.

248
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:55,426
One day, I'm gonna have my own empire.

249
00:29:56,928 --> 00:29:59,429
I'm gonna steal everything.

250
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:02,432
- Wanna help me?
- I don't know.

251
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:05,937
Sure you can. 
You ever steal a police car?

252
00:30:06,187 --> 00:30:09,574
No.

253
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:11,575
Me neither.

254
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:14,579
Hey, we could steal a whole
lot of stuff, you and me.

255
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:19,083
There's no sense sitting around a
dump like this, wasting our time.

256
00:30:19,084 --> 00:30:22,086
I heard that. I mean, there's
a world out there waiting.

257
00:30:22,087 --> 00:30:24,087
Tell you what.

258
00:30:24,088 --> 00:30:28,092
Let's you and me
go in the next room...

259
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:32,597
and start sniffing
some ideas.

260
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:34,599
Let's go.

261
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,723
"Ideas" is my middle name.

262
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,485
What do you think?

263
00:30:54,619 --> 00:30:56,621
It's fuckin' beautiful.

264
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:59,123
It's a piece of shit,
but it's yours.

265
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,628
- Is it legal?
- Yes, it's legal.

266
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:07,131
There's parts on it
borrowed, but...

267
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:11,635
registration's clean.

268
00:31:11,636 --> 00:31:14,137
Don't never say
I done nothing for you.

269
00:31:14,138 --> 00:31:17,508
Just don't know
if I could ever pay you back.

270
00:31:23,514 --> 00:31:26,517
Try this.
Stay clear of my brother.

271
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:29,020
Which one?

272
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,023
You know damn well, boy.

273
00:31:35,493 --> 00:31:38,996
OK. It's just good way for me to make some money, 
you know? It's something i can do.

274
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,749
You two jackasses,
you'll both end up in jail.

275
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:44,000
Then, you teach me.
You show me what to do.

276
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:48,005
- If I'm gonna learn, i should learn right, from you. 
- I got no time.

277
00:31:48,506 --> 00:31:50,758
Just to show me?

278
00:31:51,259 --> 00:31:52,743
Don't seem right.

279
00:31:53,211 --> 00:31:56,214
Come on, dad.
I get some guys together.

280
00:31:56,215 --> 00:31:58,216
I don't know.
We'll see.

281
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,474
You better go on home.

282
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:09,352
To your mother's.
Yeah.

283
00:32:09,353 --> 00:32:12,230
I don't know why, but...

284
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:15,733
you make Mary Sue
awful skittish.

285
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,771
- Five. 
- I'm going to bed.

286
00:32:53,772 --> 00:32:55,772
- Ten, eleven, two, three
- Wait!

287
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:59,777
Wait, wait. Julie, wait. You've got
- Mom.

288
00:32:59,778 --> 00:33:03,281
Okay, she left.
Hold on. Six, seven.

289
00:33:03,781 --> 00:33:06,284
- Six plus five... is eleven. 
- Is eleven.

290
00:33:06,285 --> 00:33:08,286
One, two, three, four...

291
00:33:08,786 --> 00:33:11,289
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

292
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:14,291
My property.
No problem.

293
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,544
Now we're gonna split
her property up.

294
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:18,922
I'll take boardwalk and park place. No.

295
00:33:18,923 --> 00:33:21,298
- You can take...
- No, I want boardwalk.

296
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,302
No, see, grandma,
if you take this property,

297
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,997
You'll have a hotel on each, and
there's better odds of landing on it.

298
00:33:27,998 --> 00:33:31,192
- No, I want boardwalk. 
- 'Cause there's three of them and there's only...

299
00:33:38,699 --> 00:33:41,701
Big Brad, you know,

300
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:45,706
When I married him, he had
the biggest eyes you ever saw,

301
00:33:45,707 --> 00:33:48,209
And he courted me
like a regular gentleman.

302
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,712
With flowers, and everything.

303
00:33:53,714 --> 00:33:56,217
Good night, little Brad.

304
00:33:56,218 --> 00:33:58,219
Good night.

305
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:14,184
Hey, Brad.
Are you awake?

306
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:17,688
There's a girl on the phone.

307
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:39,844
I'd better get you home before
your mother starts to worry.

308
00:34:42,346 --> 00:34:44,348
- It's nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

309
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:46,717
Good-Bye.

310
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:10,708
What's he like?

311
00:35:13,711 --> 00:35:15,713
Who?

312
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:05,429

313
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:07,849
Find one there.

314
00:36:10,051 --> 00:36:12,053
Find one right there.

315
00:36:13,054 --> 00:36:15,056
Back in there too.

316
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,193
How can you tell?

317
00:36:20,194 --> 00:36:23,697
Size of the lawn,
size of the stroke.

318
00:36:24,698 --> 00:36:27,634
Regular mower cuts
about a foot wide.

319
00:36:27,635 --> 00:36:30,571
Good tractor do you three or four.

320
00:36:32,073 --> 00:36:35,076
See, most people
that drive through here,

321
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:37,577
They see farms,

322
00:36:37,578 --> 00:36:41,081
Houses and fields
and... shit.

323
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:43,584
I see money. Everywhere
i go i see money.

324
00:36:44,085 --> 00:36:48,589
I see things that can move. Anything
can move it's got my name written on it.

325
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:52,093
"Brad Whitewood, please hold
for the delivery."

326
00:36:53,594 --> 00:36:59,349
- My name too.
- Yeah, little bastard.

327
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:04,488
Oh, wait, I forgot.
You's the bastard, ain't ya?

328
00:37:04,738 --> 00:37:07,608
Hey.

329
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,743
I didn't mean nothing by it.

330
00:37:10,744 --> 00:37:13,747
I swear i didn't mean
nothing by it.

331
00:37:20,004 --> 00:37:23,007
One day, you know what?
You know what I'm gonna do?

332
00:37:25,626 --> 00:37:28,012
Give you guys a present.

333
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:43,144
What do you think of that?

334
00:37:43,277 --> 00:37:45,279
Looks like a pretty nice gun.

335
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:48,282
Fuckin' A-Plus, it's a nice gun.

336
00:37:48,283 --> 00:37:52,319
It's 350, retail.

337
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:59,627
I got a good price on mine.
Real good. Wanna touch it?

338
00:37:59,628 --> 00:38:01,629
Can I?
Is that all right?

339
00:38:08,636 --> 00:38:12,173
- Do you like it?
- I like it a lot.

340
00:38:12,174 --> 00:38:14,175
You can't have it.
It's mine.

341
00:38:25,319 --> 00:38:28,321
I already give you a car.

342
00:38:28,322 --> 00:38:32,326
That don't mean nothing. 
I gotta see something in you.

343
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:36,313
I gotta see you got something... 
right here...

344
00:38:37,331 --> 00:38:40,250
between the legs,

345
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:43,236
Then I'll give you
a real present.

346
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,756
You wanna see we got something?

347
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:49,760
We'll show you something. We'll
show you something tonight.

348
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:53,130
- Yeah? 
- Hey, Brad.

349
00:38:54,632 --> 00:38:57,017
How's it going?

350
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:02,139
- These your new recruits?
- These are my sons, Lester.

351
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,642
Oh, well,

352
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:08,646
You boys have a very interesting family.

353
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,397
Get out of my face Lester.

354
00:39:11,398 --> 00:39:14,902
For instance, remember when
we stole those muskets...

355
00:39:14,903 --> 00:39:17,004
from the revolutionary war museum?

356
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,991
Of course, Dickie conked out
that, uh, janitor, making it...

357
00:39:20,992 --> 00:39:23,244
grand larceny,
aggravated assault.

358
00:39:23,245 --> 00:39:25,496
But it was a good time,
right, Brad?

359
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,000
Oh, yeah, you're smart.

360
00:39:31,001 --> 00:39:34,504
You don't wanna talk to me.
Come on, Brad.

361
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:38,559
I wanna work with you again.
I need some of that action.

362
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,561
Why, so you can tell the cops?

363
00:39:41,562 --> 00:39:45,566
Cops? Ain't so bad. 
Just doing their job.

364
00:39:46,066 --> 00:39:49,069
Just kidding.

365
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:56,493
Okay, I know.
I'm going.

366
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,497
I'm going. I'm gone.

367
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:08,956
The boy ain't got the life
expectancy of a housefly.

368
00:40:20,968 --> 00:40:23,470

369
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:02,059
Like this one time, Patch goes
into this jewelry store, right?

370
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:04,560
He asks to see
this $500 watch.

371
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:06,371
So, the lady,
she shows it to him, all right,

372
00:41:06,372 --> 00:41:08,182
But she don't wanna take
her paws off it.

373
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:11,184
He's tuggin' one direction,
she's tuggin' the other direction.

374
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:15,189
Finally, pulls up his sleeve, he
goes, "lady, mine's worth a thousand.

375
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:17,191
Why the hell
would i want yours?"

376
00:41:17,574 --> 00:41:21,445
This makes sense to her, right? So,
she takes her hands off the thing.

377
00:41:21,446 --> 00:41:23,947
He grabs the son of a bitch and
hightails it out of the store.

378
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:27,451
Shit! Something's coming.

379
00:41:57,231 --> 00:41:59,733
"oh, what a feeling 

380
00:42:00,117 --> 00:42:03,119
don't stop
oh, what a feeling 

381
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,623
tomorrow, tomorrow 
oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling 

382
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:10,127
toyota"

383
00:42:27,961 --> 00:42:30,514

384
00:42:44,328 --> 00:42:47,831
Hurry up! We gotta get this
stuff to a truck stop before dawn.

385
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,784
Yo, Brad! Yo!

386
00:42:50,785 --> 00:42:53,536
- Telephone!
- All right.

387
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:57,541
- Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
- You're one to talk. Hey!

388
00:43:03,547 --> 00:43:06,049
Make it spicy, rose.

389
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:13,557
Yo, what you got?

390
00:43:13,941 --> 00:43:15,943
- Shot.
- Say again.

391
00:43:16,443 --> 00:43:18,946
Shot. I got shot, man.
Birdshot in the face.

392
00:43:19,446 --> 00:43:22,449
- Bad?
- Well, it hurts.

393
00:43:24,952 --> 00:43:27,955
- Get any tractors?
- No.

394
00:43:30,457 --> 00:43:34,962
- Go on home, then.
- I can't. Not with my face like this.

395
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:38,465
You can't go to my place
if that's what you're asking.

396
00:43:38,966 --> 00:43:41,468
Mary Sue, me, we're here,
we're helping out... late.

397
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:45,471
Be at it all night.

398
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:48,475
Can I come where you're at?

399
00:43:49,977 --> 00:43:51,979
You got a woman...

400
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,982
someplace.

401
00:44:36,189 --> 00:44:39,643
I want you both downstairs
with your clothes on in five minutes.

402
00:44:40,143 --> 00:44:42,145
Do you hear me, Terry?

403
00:45:22,936 --> 00:45:24,938
Whoo!

404
00:47:08,675 --> 00:47:10,677
Sorry.

405
00:47:19,219 --> 00:47:21,221
Hey.

406
00:47:24,975 --> 00:47:26,977
Wake up.

407
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:42,025
You know, i know my mom.
She's not gonna sit there.

408
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:46,463
She's gonna call the cops
after me.

409
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,507
I mean,
what are we gonna do?

410
00:48:00,327 --> 00:48:02,896
We got $18 left.

411
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,686
I'm gonna have to go home.

412
00:48:23,750 --> 00:48:25,735
Listen.

413
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:32,825
If we can sometime,

414
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,511
You wanna go somewhere?

415
00:48:35,512 --> 00:48:37,581
Get our own place together?

416
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,053
Okay.

417
00:48:44,554 --> 00:48:46,556
You mean it?

418
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,276
Sure.

419
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,730
- I mean it.
- Okay.

420
00:48:54,781 --> 00:48:57,884
It might take a little while,
but i can do it.

421
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,071
How?

422
00:49:02,072 --> 00:49:04,875
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

423
00:49:04,876 --> 00:49:06,877
I worry about it.

424
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:16,803
"f you're
thinkin' you're too cool to boogie 

425
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:23,176
boy, oh, boy
have i got news for you 

426
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:32,686
everybody here tonight
must boogie"

427
00:49:32,687 --> 00:49:36,188
And right there,
sitting on my lap...

428
00:49:36,189 --> 00:49:40,193
was the most beautiful woman
you guys ever seen in your life.

429
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:44,697
Mm-Hmm. Beautiful? She was a hooker.

430
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:50,704
She wasn't a hooker.
She was a... architect.

431
00:49:50,705 --> 00:49:52,705

432
00:49:52,706 --> 00:49:55,208

some big firm in philly.

433
00:49:55,009 --> 00:49:59,011

434
00:49:59,212 --> 00:50:02,715

435
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:04,718
except for the assholes and the faggots,

436
00:50:05,218 --> 00:50:06,720
I'm the richest son of a bitch
in this county.

437
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:09,606
Mind if i sit down?

438
00:50:11,107 --> 00:50:13,610
I want you to taste something
'cause i saw you sitting there.

439
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:16,613
Yeah, see now.

440
00:50:16,614 --> 00:50:18,614
Yeah.

441
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:22,118
Private stock.

442
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:25,121

443
00:50:28,124 --> 00:50:30,125
- Were you here last week, hustling? 
- No.

444
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:34,631
I thought I saw you last week. Wait just
a minute. I need some i.D. On the lady.

445
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:37,133
I shall return.

446
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:39,001
- Get outta here.
- Andy, that's my son.

447
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:42,505
- Hell, Brad, i can't-
- Yeah, this girl, she's 23.

448
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:48,011

449
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:50,764
- Dad, this is Terry.
- Hi.

450
00:50:50,765 --> 00:50:53,392
- Hi.
- You treat my boy right.

451
00:50:53,393 --> 00:50:56,019
I will.

452
00:50:56,020 --> 00:50:58,020
I do.

453
00:50:58,021 --> 00:51:02,025
Come on. Sit down. 
Make yourself at home.

454
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:15,288
- Listen, Terry? That's Patch. 
- Yeah.

455
00:51:18,792 --> 00:51:21,928
Dickie. Boyd.

456
00:51:22,045 --> 00:51:25,181
Tony pine. He's epileptic.
What you drinking?

457
00:51:25,182 --> 00:51:28,184
- I'm fine. Thanks.
- You're overage.

458
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:32,188
She's 42.

459
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:35,750
I'll have a rolling rock.

460
00:51:35,751 --> 00:51:38,282
I'll have a whiskey sour.

461
00:51:38,283 --> 00:51:40,814
- Whiskey sour?
- They're good.

462
00:51:40,815 --> 00:51:43,817
Yeah.

463
00:51:44,317 --> 00:51:47,821
We're real glad to get to meet
you, Terry. What do you think...

464
00:51:47,954 --> 00:51:50,457
now that you get to see us
all in the flesh?

465
00:51:50,824 --> 00:51:55,328
I don't know.
Heard a lot about you.

466
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:58,715
- Nice things?
- You ain't done nothin' nice, Brad.

467
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,717
I hope not.

468
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,720
What'd you hear?

469
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:06,089
Different things.

470
00:52:08,475 --> 00:52:13,980
Dad, we wanna talk to you
for a moment.

471
00:52:22,238 --> 00:52:24,240
I came here 'cause i wanted
to ask you about this.

472
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,742
See, terry and I,
we wanna live together.

473
00:52:26,743 --> 00:52:30,246
We wanna get a place like that.
It's gonna cost some real money.

474
00:52:31,748 --> 00:52:33,750
So, I wanna join up
with you guys.

475
00:52:35,502 --> 00:52:37,504
Just temporarily.

476
00:52:55,021 --> 00:52:57,022
Fine. Fine.

477
00:52:57,023 --> 00:52:59,525
You don't have to let him in.

478
00:52:59,526 --> 00:53:02,529
But you know,
he's better than you.

479
00:53:23,166 --> 00:53:25,668
Would you excuse us?

480
00:53:27,170 --> 00:53:29,172
It's all right.

481
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,932
That's not right.

482
00:53:39,933 --> 00:53:43,436
You wanna talk to me?
You talk to me in private.

483
00:53:43,437 --> 00:53:46,940
I'll tell you something.
That girl is trouble.

484
00:53:46,941 --> 00:53:49,441
She's nice, she's young,
big mouth.

485
00:53:49,442 --> 00:53:52,946
You stick with us. You stick by me. 
You can see this is a group.

486
00:53:52,947 --> 00:53:54,948
You know,
you don't violate that.

487
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:59,451
Take her home.

488
00:53:59,452 --> 00:54:02,838
Don't ever do that again.

489
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,342
Okay? Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

490
00:54:06,343 --> 00:54:08,344
And look.

491
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:13,850
Everything will work out fine.

492
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:16,853
Yeah.

493
00:54:18,354 --> 00:54:20,857
Okay.

494
00:54:21,357 --> 00:54:22,859
Sorry.

495
00:54:39,626 --> 00:54:42,128
Go ahead.
What else?

496
00:54:43,630 --> 00:54:47,133
Well, this group of guys,
whatever you call it...

497
00:54:48,635 --> 00:54:52,138
- goes all over the country, huh? 
- Yeah.

498
00:54:52,139 --> 00:54:55,141
And it's organized?

499
00:54:55,142 --> 00:54:58,143
- Organized?
- Yeah.

500
00:54:58,144 --> 00:55:00,647
Enough.
It's just guys, you know.

501
00:55:01,147 --> 00:55:04,149
I know guys,
and Tony Pine knows some.

502
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,152
Boyd, my brothers,
everybody knows some people.

503
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:08,655
These people know people.

504
00:55:08,656 --> 00:55:11,156
Before you know it,

505
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:13,159
You know everybody you gotta
know to get the job done.

506
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,161
That's it.

507
00:55:16,663 --> 00:55:18,664
How do you keep cops
off your ass?

508
00:55:18,665 --> 00:55:22,168
I got a friend
who reads the police memos.

509
00:55:22,169 --> 00:55:25,671
For instance, they
just got this report

510
00:55:25,672 --> 00:55:29,676
there's more tractors stolen in
Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania

511
00:55:29,677 --> 00:55:33,179
That's us- Than all the
other 47 states together.

512
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:36,683
Makes the cops around here
kinda peppy, so...

513
00:55:36,684 --> 00:55:39,185
we lay off tractors
for a while.

514
00:55:39,186 --> 00:55:41,187
Anything else?

515
00:55:43,806 --> 00:55:47,277
- Why are you letting me ask you all this? 
- 'Cause you gotta know.

516
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,280
I gotta make sure you walk
into this with your eyes wide...

517
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:53,283
and know what you're doing
and who you're with.

518
00:55:55,285 --> 00:55:57,787
Especially, you know,
it's a family situation.

519
00:56:05,628 --> 00:56:07,630
You go out with us
once or twice.

520
00:56:07,631 --> 00:56:09,631
See how it is,
then you decide.

521
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:14,137
If you still want it...
'Cause if you do, that's it.

522
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:18,641
It's blood.
Don't break it.

523
00:56:40,776 --> 00:56:43,779
- Don't want none.
- Dickie.

524
00:57:32,194 --> 00:57:35,013
The caretaker's light
just went on.

525
00:57:35,014 --> 00:57:37,833
Okay, don't move at all!
Don't move.

526
00:57:56,352 --> 00:57:58,854
- Good.
- Good goin', kid.

527
00:58:03,325 --> 00:58:05,327
Bye-Bye.

528
00:58:06,829 --> 00:58:09,015
Go, go, go!

529
00:58:09,115 --> 00:58:12,118
You know what? 
I've been thinking.

530
00:58:12,119 --> 00:58:15,120
I oughta sign up
at the university.

531
00:58:15,121 --> 00:58:17,123
Hey, that's a real good idea,
Patch. That's real swift.

532
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:21,877
No, no, no, no, no. Take
one of them art courses.

533
00:58:21,878 --> 00:58:25,256
We go into a joint like that,
must be t-trillions

534
00:58:25,257 --> 00:58:28,634
Hundreds of trillions of dollars
hanging on the wall.

535
00:58:28,768 --> 00:58:31,270
And we're too dumb
to know which ones to take.

536
00:58:31,771 --> 00:58:34,774
Take the ugly ones. Uglier
they are, more they're worth.

537
00:58:34,775 --> 00:58:36,776
That's right.

538
00:58:44,784 --> 00:58:47,286
- What? 
- You showed me something tonight.

539
00:58:47,787 --> 00:58:49,789
- What?
- My own blood.

540
00:58:50,289 --> 00:58:52,158
Am i right?

541
00:58:56,045 --> 00:59:00,049
- You're gonna make it.
- Heard that.

542
00:59:00,416 --> 00:59:04,553
Lookie here.

543
00:59:04,554 --> 00:59:08,557
Good ol' detective mosker.

544
00:59:09,058 --> 00:59:11,060
He really got class.

545
00:59:15,564 --> 00:59:17,566
Havin' hamburger steak.

546
00:59:21,070 --> 00:59:23,572
Well, hello.

547
01:00:01,527 --> 01:00:03,529
See ya later.

548
01:00:06,031 --> 01:00:11,036
Oh, I know. Did you hear about that
girl that was eight before she was seven?

549
01:00:11,037 --> 01:00:15,541
Oop, 
I hate those short eyes jokes.

550
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:18,543
Look who waited up.

551
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:21,046
Well, I didn't want you
getting the wrong idea,

552
01:00:21,047 --> 01:00:23,549
My sharin' dinner
with some fuckin' cop.

553
01:00:25,551 --> 01:00:27,552
We didn't get
the wrong idea, Lester.

554
01:00:27,553 --> 01:00:30,673
- We got the right idea. 
- Yeah.

555
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:35,177
Wanna go out?

556
01:00:35,178 --> 01:00:37,179
A job?
Right now.

557
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,934
- Okay, no, i... 
- Don't say no. It's your chance to prove yourself.

558
01:00:41,935 --> 01:00:46,188
Come on, Lester. 
I know you're a good man.

559
01:00:46,655 --> 01:00:49,658
- Catch up.
- Come on, drink up, drink up.

560
01:00:52,161 --> 01:00:56,665
That's more like it.
We're drunk as skunks,

561
01:00:56,666 --> 01:00:59,168
And we want you to feel
just as good.

562
01:01:01,670 --> 01:01:05,174
That's more like it.

563
01:01:05,175 --> 01:01:07,675
I have somethin'.

564
01:01:07,676 --> 01:01:10,679
- You gettin' high? Drink it, it's for you. 
- I don't know.

565
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,681
Eat this.
Eat this.

566
01:01:15,184 --> 01:01:20,689
- What is it? 
- It's uh... somethin' to eat. Eat it.

567
01:01:23,192 --> 01:01:27,645
- What you been tellin' the cops, Lester? 
- Nothin'!

568
01:01:27,646 --> 01:01:30,649
What you talkin' to Mosker about? 
The weather, the phillies?

569
01:01:30,650 --> 01:01:34,619
No. No, NO, just, uh...

570
01:01:34,620 --> 01:01:38,123
I know you've been talkin'
about somethin'.

571
01:01:40,626 --> 01:01:44,128
- I'm scared. 
- What?

572
01:01:44,129 --> 01:01:48,634
You can't be scared. 
You're a tough guy.

573
01:01:48,635 --> 01:01:51,637
You used to be a member
of the Whitewood gang.

574
01:01:52,137 --> 01:01:55,641
Yeah, I know, but...

575
01:01:57,643 --> 01:02:00,646
What'd you say?
Speak up.

576
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:08,153
- Well, I, I sold him some information. 
- Leave him alone.

577
01:02:08,154 --> 01:02:11,657
Yeah, but it wasn't true information. 
It was about Soleski.

578
01:02:11,658 --> 01:02:15,160
- Oh? Oh, I hate him. 
- Yeah, I know.

579
01:02:15,661 --> 01:02:17,162
- I, I wouldn't hurt you, Brad. You know that. 
- He's a fat pig.

580
01:02:17,663 --> 01:02:19,664
- I wanna help you, I do.
- Yeah?

581
01:02:19,665 --> 01:02:22,167
I was pumpin' him for information,
stuff you guys can use.

582
01:02:22,168 --> 01:02:25,169
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, hurry up.

583
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:28,674
I found out that, uh, 
they brought the F.B.I. in.

584
01:02:28,675 --> 01:02:31,676
- Yeah? No shit? 
- Yeah.

585
01:02:31,677 --> 01:02:37,182
And, uh, they got this, uh, 
grand jury convened.

586
01:02:37,183 --> 01:02:39,183
- About us?
- Sure.

587
01:02:39,184 --> 01:02:43,188
I'm telling you, who would
tell you this kind of stuff

588
01:02:43,189 --> 01:02:45,189
if it wasn't for me?

589
01:02:45,190 --> 01:02:48,192
I don't know. Guess you're
just a real good friend.

590
01:02:48,193 --> 01:02:53,198
I don't feel too good. 
I drank too much.

591
01:02:53,199 --> 01:02:57,653
- Better pull over.
- Pull over by this tree.

592
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,763
We're goin' down
to the river.

593
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:32,271
I'm glad to be able to...

594
01:03:32,272 --> 01:03:34,772
Ahh.

595
01:03:34,773 --> 01:03:36,775
I can't walk.

596
01:03:40,279 --> 01:03:42,781
Hey! Hey!

597
01:03:42,782 --> 01:03:44,783
Whoa.

598
01:03:46,285 --> 01:03:49,288
- Feel that water, Les? It's good. 
- Yeah.

599
01:03:49,289 --> 01:03:51,790
Wake you right up. 

600
01:03:53,792 --> 01:03:55,294
It's getting deeper.

601
01:04:05,304 --> 01:04:09,808
Get your face wet. Water on
your face really wakes you up.

602
01:04:09,809 --> 01:04:12,311
Hey, I don't need your help.
No, I can do it alone!

603
01:04:12,811 --> 01:04:14,813
Hey! Whoa!

604
01:04:15,314 --> 01:04:17,316
Ahh, Brad!

605
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:45,010
Shh.

606
01:04:52,017 --> 01:04:55,904
We get this thing fixed up,
you'll be one cool dude,

607
01:04:55,905 --> 01:04:57,906
A real rumbler.

608
01:05:04,913 --> 01:05:08,416
I think I'm gonna
get myself a job...

609
01:05:08,417 --> 01:05:12,104
- fixing chevys or something.
- How much you make?

610
01:05:12,105 --> 01:05:15,791
You can get like ten,
twelve an hour. It depends.

611
01:05:18,293 --> 01:05:20,295
That ain't that much.

612
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:25,300
Hey, it's a steady job.
Nobody gets killed.

613
01:05:29,304 --> 01:05:31,306
Somebody got killed?

614
01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:37,312
Brad, when you went out with dad
and them, did somebody get killed?

615
01:05:37,313 --> 01:05:39,314
Forget it.

616
01:05:40,315 --> 01:05:42,818
- Brad. 
- I said forget it, Tommy.

617
01:05:56,081 --> 01:05:58,083
- He's no good.
- What?

618
01:05:58,084 --> 01:06:00,084
They're no good.

619
01:06:00,085 --> 01:06:02,721
- What are you talking about?
- They're bad people.

620
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:09,228
- Hi, boys! 
- Hi, dad.

621
01:06:21,240 --> 01:06:23,242
- What you think of that? 
- That's nice.

622
01:06:23,742 --> 01:06:25,743
I just got it.

623
01:06:25,744 --> 01:06:28,247
You see, the thing is-

01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:36,255
And I was wondering if you guys

626
01:06:36,256 --> 01:06:38,257

Goin' out tonight.

Be by around midnight.

631

What's the damage? Twenty-Five? Forty.

632
01:07:09,789 --> 01:07:12,041
- Yeah?
- Forty.

633
01:07:12,042 --> 01:07:14,293
You a born thief.

634
01:07:25,304 --> 01:07:27,806
You crazy.
You know, you crazy.

635
01:07:33,812 --> 01:07:36,815
Lookin' good,
Julie Whitewood!

636
01:07:36,816 --> 01:07:39,318
Tired old bag of shit.

637
01:07:42,321 --> 01:07:44,323
You like that car?
You wanna sit in that car?

638
01:07:44,324 --> 01:07:47,326
- Is it all right?
- Go on, sit in it.

639
01:07:47,826 --> 01:07:49,828
All right.

640
01:07:54,333 --> 01:07:57,336
I'm not goin' out tonight.

641
01:07:57,836 --> 01:08:01,340
- What?
- I'm not gonna go out anymore.

642
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:11,716
You wanna live 
in a dump like this?

643
01:08:11,717 --> 01:08:15,219
Workin' ten hours a day
in a cannery?

644
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:20,225
I thought you were like me.
I thought you wanted something.

645
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:23,194
A car,

646
01:08:23,195 --> 01:08:26,698
Nice girl sittin' in your lap,
money in your pocket.

647
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:29,201
You said I could go out
and then decide, right?

648
01:08:29,701 --> 01:08:32,203
You scared?

649
01:08:32,204 --> 01:08:35,207
- I got somethin' else.
- Somethin' or somebody?

650
01:08:35,707 --> 01:08:40,211
Yeah, Terry and I
are gettin' outta here.

651
01:08:40,212 --> 01:08:42,714
Where you gonna go? What are you
gonna do when you get where you go?

652
01:08:42,715 --> 01:08:45,083
I got some ideas.

653
01:08:48,587 --> 01:08:51,589
How you gonna pay?

654
01:08:51,590 --> 01:08:54,092
Apartment, food, clothes.

655
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:56,595
- All that.
- I'll find something.

656
01:08:58,597 --> 01:09:02,851
You'll find shit! 
All you know is how to steal.

657
01:09:02,852 --> 01:09:07,105
You're too fuckin' dumb
to do that by yourself.

658
01:09:07,106 --> 01:09:10,609
- Oh, you think so?
- I know so.

659
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:14,613
You'll come back, crawlin' back to
me, "daddy, daddy, give me somethin'."

660
01:09:14,614 --> 01:09:17,366
- Well, we'll see. We'll see. 
- Yeah, we'll see, yep.

661
01:09:40,355 --> 01:09:42,441
What's the matter?

662
01:09:47,979 --> 01:09:51,983
Tell me about your uncle.

663
01:09:52,484 --> 01:09:56,988
Your uncle. 
Will he really take us?

664
01:09:57,489 --> 01:09:58,990
Sure.

665
01:10:01,993 --> 01:10:05,046
What's it like there?
What does it look like?

666
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:15,056
It's called
the big sky country,

667
01:10:15,057 --> 01:10:18,059
'Cause the land goes on forever,

668
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:22,564
Lookin' out 20 miles one way,
50 in the other.

669
01:10:24,866 --> 01:10:26,967
And they got jobs there too.

670
01:10:26,968 --> 01:10:30,939
My cousin's husband, rollie,
he's got a job in billings,

671
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:34,943
And he's about as dumb
as a dog or something.

672
01:10:37,446 --> 01:10:39,948
You know what else they got?

673
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:44,002
My cousin- She's just two years
older than me, and she's got a baby.

674
01:10:47,622 --> 01:10:51,126
It's got little tiny feet
and little hands,

675
01:10:51,626 --> 01:10:53,628
And it laughs already.

676
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:57,149
It probably talks now, but when
I was there, it was just laughing.

677
01:10:57,150 --> 01:10:58,950
It was so tiny.

678
01:11:05,390 --> 01:11:07,392
I guess I love you, huh?

679
01:11:26,711 --> 01:11:29,214
So,

680
01:11:29,714 --> 01:11:31,716
What do you think?

681
01:11:32,717 --> 01:11:37,706
I don't know.
It- It seems...

682
01:11:37,707 --> 01:11:39,724
It's a little big.

683
01:11:40,725 --> 01:11:43,227
Who cares if it's
a fucked-Up idea?

684
01:11:43,228 --> 01:11:46,731
- If we get away with it, we score big, right? 
- Look, it's not a fucked-Up idea.

685
01:11:46,732 --> 01:11:50,735
All we have to do is get in and
out of there as fast as possible.

686
01:11:54,739 --> 01:11:56,741
Okay?

687
01:11:58,743 --> 01:12:00,996
Okay.

688
01:12:24,019 --> 01:12:27,021
Ahh!

689
01:12:27,022 --> 01:12:30,024
Ah, come on, there's a car!

690
01:12:30,025 --> 01:12:32,526
Oh, shit. Somebody's coming. 
Come on, let's go.

691
01:12:32,527 --> 01:12:35,530
- Tommy, come on, help Tim get these ramps. 
- Get the crowbar.

692
01:12:35,531 --> 01:12:38,033
- Where the fuck is it?
- Aggie! Come on!

693
01:12:38,283 --> 01:12:41,786
- Get a load of this, man.
- Come on, the car!

694
01:12:41,787 --> 01:12:43,788
- I gotta have her!
- Let's go!

695
01:12:48,910 --> 01:12:51,413
- Come on!
- Isn't she beautiful?

696
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:56,418
- Let go, man! Get in!
- Close the door and shut it!

697
01:13:02,924 --> 01:13:04,926
Fuck it! Come on!

698
01:13:24,446 --> 01:13:27,449
Now I want you to climb down
from there very slowly. Fuck!

699
01:13:58,363 --> 01:14:00,864
Okay, bailed out:

700
01:14:00,865 --> 01:14:06,788
Essex, Milton,
Smithson and Whitewood, T.

701
01:14:10,792 --> 01:14:12,794
Go on.

702
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:08,882
You here to shut this down?

703
01:15:08,883 --> 01:15:11,886
Maybe next week. What
do you want, Whitewood?

704
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:14,389
I put 500 on that gray one.

705
01:15:14,390 --> 01:15:16,891
Ho, ho,
that's a screwd bet.

706
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:22,396
- What's my son sayin'?
- Nothin'.

707
01:15:22,397 --> 01:15:26,401
- Yeah? 
- But they haven't really started on him yet.

708
01:15:27,902 --> 01:15:31,406
What about the F.B.I.?
They really bring 'em in?

709
01:15:31,407 --> 01:15:33,407
Mm-Hmm, last month.

710
01:15:33,408 --> 01:15:35,910
- Grand jury?
- Mm-Hmm. Mm-Hmm.

711
01:15:37,412 --> 01:15:40,415
- What they got?
- Oh, not much so far.

712
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:43,418
I'm sure they'll find something.

713
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:45,420
Maybe a body or two, hmm?

714
01:15:49,924 --> 01:15:53,928
Can I make a donation?
A political somethin'?

715
01:15:53,929 --> 01:15:57,932
No, not now.
It's too hot.

716
01:15:57,933 --> 01:16:01,936
- Oh, your bird lost.
- So he did.

717
01:16:09,828 --> 01:16:12,330
Maybe next week, hmm? 
If they don't get anything more.

718
01:16:12,331 --> 01:16:15,083
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we'll see.

719
01:16:15,084 --> 01:16:17,836
If they do... get more?

720
01:16:41,442 --> 01:16:44,696
Hi, is mr. Whitewood here?
M- My name's terry.

721
01:16:46,648 --> 01:16:48,650
It's okay.

722
01:16:55,156 --> 01:16:57,158
Thanks.

723
01:17:02,914 --> 01:17:07,417
Um, I was planning
to go see Brad,

724
01:17:07,418 --> 01:17:11,923
And, uh, his mother can't go till
the weekend 'cause she's working.

725
01:17:11,924 --> 01:17:15,426
So I was wondering 
if you're planning to go.

726
01:17:20,431 --> 01:17:22,934
Maybe.

727
01:17:23,434 --> 01:17:25,937
Well, if you do go,

728
01:17:26,437 --> 01:17:30,441
Do you mind if i go with you?

729
01:17:30,442 --> 01:17:32,443
I don't see why not.

730
01:17:32,944 --> 01:17:36,948
- You've done a lot for my boy. 
- I hope so.

731
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,954
- You changed him.
- Thank you.

732
01:17:45,456 --> 01:17:49,460
What i don't get is why
they let everybody else out,

733
01:17:49,461 --> 01:17:51,963
And they set Brad's bail so high.

734
01:17:54,465 --> 01:17:56,466
I don't get it.

735
01:17:56,467 --> 01:18:00,471
They figure,
if he's in there long enough,

736
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:04,475
- We'll know what he's saying. 
- About what?

737
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,482
Oh.

738
01:18:16,070 --> 01:18:20,074
Mmh.

739
01:18:22,210 --> 01:18:24,662
You want some corn flakes?

740
01:18:26,164 --> 01:18:28,165
No, thanks.

741
01:18:33,304 --> 01:18:35,807
- You scared, kid?
- Of what?

742
01:18:36,307 --> 01:18:38,809
A bunch of tractor thieves?

743
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:42,814
What do you owe those guys?
What'd they ever do for you?

744
01:18:43,314 --> 01:18:45,316
What'd your father ever do for you?

745
01:18:46,818 --> 01:18:49,821
I don't talk against my family.

746
01:18:55,860 --> 01:18:57,862
Hello?

747
01:19:16,130 --> 01:19:21,636
Uh, look, uh,
do me a favor.

748
01:19:21,637 --> 01:19:25,639
That's 12,000 cash.

749
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,643
- Tell Brad that
- He don't want it.

750
01:19:30,278 --> 01:19:32,279
Let him decide.

751
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:34,315
I said he don't want it.

752
01:19:37,485 --> 01:19:39,988
- Wow, that's a really nice cake.
- Has it got a file in it?

753
01:19:40,488 --> 01:19:42,991
Yeah.

754
01:19:44,993 --> 01:19:47,995
I didn't-
I didn't even know you-

755
01:19:47,996 --> 01:19:49,998
I didn't know you guys
knew each other really.

756
01:19:50,498 --> 01:19:54,002
Lucas?
Oh, yeah.

757
01:19:54,502 --> 01:19:58,006
Only one in the whole kiddie gang
knows his ass from a pitchfork.

758
01:19:58,007 --> 01:20:00,508
I'm kinda takin' him
under my wing.

759
01:20:02,010 --> 01:20:04,012
Yeah.

760
01:20:07,015 --> 01:20:10,018
How you doin'?
Nervous, I bet.

761
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:15,023
- I'm okay. 
- Ever been inside a jail before?

762
01:20:15,273 --> 01:20:17,274
No. No way.

763
01:20:17,275 --> 01:20:19,777
It's nasty, I'll tell ya. 
It gives me the jimmies every time.

764
01:20:20,278 --> 01:20:22,780
Oh, yeah.

765
01:20:26,284 --> 01:20:29,786
- Want some? 
- What is it? Bourbon?

766
01:20:29,787 --> 01:20:32,790
It's just rye. You're
welcome to it, if you want.

767
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:35,293
- Oh, yeah. I heard that. 
- It's good stuff.

768
01:20:35,793 --> 01:20:37,795
That'll really- It's
not a bad idea, really-

769
01:20:38,296 --> 01:20:42,300
- Get a little juiced before you get in there. 
- Get some system goin'.

770
01:20:47,305 --> 01:20:49,807
See, the thing is, it's
gonna be worst of all on you.

771
01:20:49,808 --> 01:20:52,809
Why's that?

772
01:20:52,810 --> 01:20:56,564
- Bein' a girl.
- Bein'- Bein' a cute girl.

773
01:20:56,565 --> 01:21:00,317
Yeah, bein' real cute
and bein' a girl.

774
01:21:00,318 --> 01:21:05,323
All them other convicts and the perverts
and such, be givin' you a real long look.

775
01:21:05,324 --> 01:21:09,327
- Oh, they be lookin' at you all over. 
- That's right.

776
01:21:10,828 --> 01:21:13,330
Convicts stare.

777
01:21:13,331 --> 01:21:15,333
- Aren't you gonna protect me?
- Can't.

778
01:21:15,334 --> 01:21:17,335
- Sure.
- Not from their eyes.

779
01:21:17,835 --> 01:21:19,337
Don't worry about it.

780
01:21:22,840 --> 01:21:25,843
Another sip of that, 
you won't feel nothin'.

781
01:21:27,345 --> 01:21:29,347
Go on.

782
01:21:35,353 --> 01:21:38,356
- Just go on.
- That's good stuff, huh?

783
01:21:38,357 --> 01:21:40,858
- Drink it.
- Yeah.

784
01:21:56,874 --> 01:21:59,877
- I am okay. 
- Come on. Just leave it there.

785
01:22:01,879 --> 01:22:04,881
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

786
01:22:04,882 --> 01:22:08,886
- Come on. Come on. 
- What? You touched me.

787
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:10,888
Okay.

788
01:22:13,391 --> 01:22:15,892
Come on.

789
01:22:15,893 --> 01:22:18,895
I wanna go-

790
01:22:18,896 --> 01:22:20,898
I wanna go see Brad.
I don't wanna go in there.

791
01:22:20,899 --> 01:22:23,401
Screw Brad.

792
01:22:23,402 --> 01:22:25,403
No.

793
01:22:30,408 --> 01:22:33,410
What are you doing? Where's lucas?

794
01:22:33,411 --> 01:22:38,416
Made a mistake. To let a woman rule
his business- That is a mistake.

795
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:40,668
What do you mean?

796
01:22:41,169 --> 01:22:44,171
Where the fuck-

797
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:49,676
I wanna get out of this fucking place. 
- You scared yet? Hmm?

798
01:22:49,677 --> 01:22:52,180
Here, drink that down. You got
that pill? What is this place?

799
01:22:52,181 --> 01:22:55,183
Where is it? Where is it?
Let me see it. Right.

800
01:22:55,184 --> 01:22:57,685
Drink it down.
You scared yet?

801
01:22:57,686 --> 01:22:59,186
Mm.

802
01:22:59,187 --> 01:23:02,189
- You oughta be.
- I'm not scared of you.

803
01:23:02,190 --> 01:23:06,693
You scared yet? No? Look, we
gotta get something straight now.

804
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:10,198
Oh, no, you're not goin' anywhere.
We gotta get somethin' straight.

805
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:13,201
You ain't gonna see my son.

806
01:23:13,701 --> 01:23:17,204
Okay?
You give me your word.

807
01:23:17,205 --> 01:23:20,208
I gotta hear it.
I gotta believe it.

808
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:24,211
- I love Brad.
- Well, that's your mistake.

809
01:23:24,212 --> 01:23:28,215
- I love him! 
- That's a mistake. It's over. That's it.

810
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:31,969
You know too much, you think too
much, you talk too much. That's it.

811
01:23:31,970 --> 01:23:35,598
Okay? Where you goin'? Where you
goin'? Where the fuck you goin'?

812
01:23:35,599 --> 01:23:39,227
Come here. Let me tell you
something. Let me tell you something.

813
01:23:41,979 --> 01:23:44,865
- The answer's no.
- I ain't askin'.

814
01:23:50,871 --> 01:23:52,873
The answer is no.

815
01:23:55,376 --> 01:23:58,629
By the time I'm through with
you, you won't wanna see him.

816
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:01,881
- He won't wanna touch you. Do you understand? 
- Get off me!

817
01:24:01,882 --> 01:24:05,386
- You understand? He won't wanna fuckin' touch you. 
- Get off me!

818
01:24:05,503 --> 01:24:07,505
You understand now?

819
01:25:15,039 --> 01:25:18,659
- Well?
- Sit down.

820
01:25:19,043 --> 01:25:24,048
Ma'am? Ma'am!

821
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:30,805
- Yes? 
- Is there a Thomas Whitewood here?

822
01:25:33,174 --> 01:25:35,810
Are you thomas whitewood?

823
01:25:37,311 --> 01:25:40,314
- What about it?
- I need you to sign this.

824
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:48,322
Please, just sign it.

825
01:25:51,325 --> 01:25:53,327
What is this?

826
01:25:56,831 --> 01:25:58,833
Thank you.

827
01:26:06,841 --> 01:26:09,844
Somebody gave your name
to the grand jury.

828
01:26:09,845 --> 01:26:12,346
All right, you motherfucker!

829
01:26:25,226 --> 01:26:28,229
Motherfucker!

830
01:26:28,230 --> 01:26:31,232
Scum!
Motherfucker!

831
01:27:17,495 --> 01:27:20,498
Hell, man, don't
worry about no subpoena.

832
01:27:20,499 --> 01:27:22,999
They got nothing on you.

833
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:27,504
Yeah. Gee, I sure hope not.

834
01:27:27,505 --> 01:27:32,009
They're just fishin'
for somethin' or other.

835
01:27:32,010 --> 01:27:36,514
Now, where the
hell is this tractor, anyhow?

836
01:27:36,515 --> 01:27:38,516
- Patch?
- Up a ways.

837
01:27:38,883 --> 01:27:41,384
This is one hell of a...

838
01:27:41,385 --> 01:27:46,390
Jesus h. Christ kind of a place
to go find some tractor.

839
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:49,894
We only found it, 'cause 
last year, Dickie,

840
01:27:50,394 --> 01:27:52,396
He poached for deer
up in these woods.

841
01:27:52,897 --> 01:27:56,901
A white deer.
Right over in there.

842
01:28:03,824 --> 01:28:05,326
Now what's that?

843
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:13,083
Damn, I thought he was gonna
back right into his grave.

844
01:28:42,613 --> 01:28:46,116
You know, Aggie,
I like that ring you got.

845
01:28:46,117 --> 01:28:49,619
- What'd it cost?
- Beats me.

846
01:28:49,620 --> 01:28:54,625
- Is that a real sapphire? 
- Wouldn't you like to know?

847
01:28:57,127 --> 01:28:59,129
Yeah, I would.

848
01:29:03,634 --> 01:29:05,636
Is that a real gun?

849
01:29:33,747 --> 01:29:36,250
Come on, right over here!
Get your tickets right here!

850
01:29:36,251 --> 01:29:39,253
Get your tickets here!
Hubba, hubba, hubba!

851
01:29:43,257 --> 01:29:46,260
Come on, give me
one of those tickets!

852
01:30:05,863 --> 01:30:07,865
Ever been out west, Tommy?

853
01:30:07,866 --> 01:30:10,400
No.

854
01:30:10,401 --> 01:30:15,405
- Ever heard a coyote?
- No.

855
01:30:15,406 --> 01:30:18,459
They make this sound like,
whoo, whoo, whoo.

856
01:30:20,511 --> 01:30:23,430
Coyote bitch gets in heat,

857
01:30:23,431 --> 01:30:25,932
First thing she does,

858
01:30:25,933 --> 01:30:28,419
She'd take care of the males.

859
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:32,939
Then she head toward town.

860
01:30:32,940 --> 01:30:35,926
All the neighborhood dogs,
they smell her.

861
01:30:35,927 --> 01:30:40,447
They go crazy.
They follow her.

862
01:30:43,150 --> 01:30:46,320
She lures them,
out onto the desert.

863
01:30:46,321 --> 01:30:48,555
She get the dog out there...

864
01:30:49,573 --> 01:30:52,075
alone.

865
01:30:52,076 --> 01:30:54,578
All the other coyote come along.

866
01:30:54,579 --> 01:30:57,080
They circle round.

867
01:30:57,081 --> 01:31:00,134
They kill that dog.
Eat it.

868
01:31:02,803 --> 01:31:04,804
Tommy,

869
01:31:04,805 --> 01:31:10,310
If you was to go up in front of
that grand jury, what would you say?

870
01:31:10,311 --> 01:31:12,413
Nothin'.

871
01:31:14,982 --> 01:31:17,985
- Dad.
- Liar!

872
01:32:05,816 --> 01:32:09,820
That's our deal. You let me outta here
right now, or I don't say one more word.

873
01:32:09,953 --> 01:32:14,457
Can't do it. Your father's
hiding three kids already.

874
01:32:14,458 --> 01:32:17,961
Besides, the only thing you've talked
about so far are tractor thefts.

875
01:32:17,962 --> 01:32:19,963
Why should we think you have
anything else to tell us?

876
01:32:21,882 --> 01:32:24,134
Have you guys ever heard
of Lester Peralsky?

877
01:32:31,258 --> 01:32:34,762
Ma, Terry and I are leaving'.
We're gettin' outta here.

878
01:32:34,763 --> 01:32:37,765
You'd be goin' where?

879
01:32:38,265 --> 01:32:40,267
- I got relatives in-
- Far away.

880
01:32:41,769 --> 01:32:44,154
Do you have any money we can borrow?

881
01:32:45,656 --> 01:32:47,658
Not really.

882
01:32:48,158 --> 01:32:51,161
Well, I have a little bit.

883
01:32:51,162 --> 01:32:53,663
Great.

884
01:32:53,664 --> 01:32:59,169
- Say, Brad junior, have you
heard anything from Tommy? 
- No.

885
01:33:00,170 --> 01:33:03,173
I don't even wanna think about Tommy.

886
01:33:04,675 --> 01:33:06,676
What is that supposed to mean?

887
01:33:06,677 --> 01:33:10,681
Just itself.
Don't think about him.

888
01:33:29,399 --> 01:33:32,269
How about this?

889
01:33:32,270 --> 01:33:34,905
Let's tie him to a tree...

890
01:33:34,906 --> 01:33:37,541
in the back of the woods...

891
01:33:38,008 --> 01:33:40,443
and just stare at him for a while.

892
01:33:40,444 --> 01:33:44,581
- No!
- But can't you just see it?

893
01:33:44,582 --> 01:33:49,051
He's tied to a tree...
naked.

894
01:33:49,052 --> 01:33:53,056
And we could give him
like a lollipop or somethin'...

895
01:33:53,557 --> 01:33:57,044
- or a can of Budweiser.
- Shut up!

896
01:33:59,513 --> 01:34:03,016
Suppose that little girl is with him?

897
01:34:03,017 --> 01:34:05,519
Then bye-Bye girl.

898
01:34:06,486 --> 01:34:10,941
That's too bad.
She was real cute.

899
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:17,865
Might be better, uh,
if it was at night.

900
01:34:20,367 --> 01:34:22,369
Right?

901
01:34:27,875 --> 01:34:30,377
- I don't want no part of this. 
- Boyd?

902
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:35,883
You got the soul of a pig.

903
01:34:37,351 --> 01:34:39,353
A stuck pig.

904
01:34:40,837 --> 01:34:43,840
Sooey. Sooey, sooey.

905
01:34:47,811 --> 01:34:49,813
I don't care.

906
01:34:51,315 --> 01:34:54,318
I'm not touchin' this one.

907
01:34:54,319 --> 01:34:56,320
Okay.

908
01:35:06,464 --> 01:35:08,465
Well?

909
01:35:32,072 --> 01:35:35,192
You can hang it up where you're
going to. I mean, if you want to.

910
01:35:35,659 --> 01:35:37,611
Thanks.

911
01:35:49,373 --> 01:35:51,875
- Gotta go. 
- Brad!

912
01:35:54,878 --> 01:35:57,381
It's something over 400.

913
01:35:57,382 --> 01:35:59,383
Thanks a lot.

914
01:35:59,883 --> 01:36:02,386
I guess it's a rainy day.

915
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:04,388
Thanks grandma.

916
01:36:11,895 --> 01:36:13,897
- Take care of Terry now.
- I will.

917
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,402
- Good-Bye.
- Bye.

918
01:37:15,292 --> 01:37:18,295
- How's it coming?
- It's almost there.

919
01:37:19,796 --> 01:37:22,799
It could wait till morning.

920
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,427
No. Your mother'll
be back in the morning.

921
01:37:25,428 --> 01:37:29,494
Farther we are away,
it'll be a lot better.

922
01:37:29,495 --> 01:37:33,560
"you don't have to say
what i wanna do"

923
01:37:33,561 --> 01:37:36,063

924
01:37:49,843 --> 01:37:53,879
"come on, come on, come on
and have a pepsi day 

925
01:37:53,880 --> 01:37:57,883
it's the laughter of a world
at play memories of a pepsi day

926
01:37:57,884 --> 01:38:01,888
come on, come on and have a pepsi day
join the pepsi generation 

927
01:38:01,889 --> 01:38:07,394
have a pepsi day 

928
01:38:48,685 --> 01:38:51,688
Oh, I forgot to feed the dog.

929
01:38:54,057 --> 01:38:55,058
Oh, no!

930
01:41:08,024 --> 01:41:10,527
Hey, dad.

931
01:41:17,183 --> 01:41:19,735
Let ya outta the stir?

932
01:41:19,736 --> 01:41:23,255
Yeah, I just told them
a pack of lies...

933
01:41:23,256 --> 01:41:26,209
and now I'm just runnin'
where they can't find me.

934
01:41:26,210 --> 01:41:29,195
That's good.

935
01:41:29,713 --> 01:41:31,715
Where nobody can find me.

936
01:41:31,716 --> 01:41:34,718
Good.

937
01:41:36,219 --> 01:41:38,221
You got a beer?

938
01:41:40,223 --> 01:41:42,726
Yeah, sure.

939
01:41:52,902 --> 01:41:54,904
Gotta take a leak.

940
01:42:37,831 --> 01:42:41,368
Dad.

941
01:42:48,375 --> 01:42:50,877
It's good to see you.
Really.

942
01:42:55,382 --> 01:42:58,076
You look pale.

943
01:42:58,077 --> 01:43:00,770
I am pale.

944
01:43:04,274 --> 01:43:06,526
Where you been tonight?

945
01:43:09,028 --> 01:43:12,532
Got drunk, had a fight. Mary
Sue, you know, kicked her out.

946
01:43:12,533 --> 01:43:16,536
You know, went to Andy's.
Same old thing, you know?

947
01:43:16,903 --> 01:43:21,491
Yeah, I know.
Know where I been?

948
01:43:30,467 --> 01:43:33,420
That's nothin'. I just cut
myself on some barbed wire.

949
01:43:34,921 --> 01:43:38,425
Don't move. I said,
don't fuckin' move!

950
01:43:38,558 --> 01:43:41,060
- Just goin' to get some-
- I said, don't fuckin' move.

951
01:43:42,929 --> 01:43:45,932
Is this the gun you used?

952
01:43:46,433 --> 01:43:48,935
That's a nice-looking gun.

953
01:43:52,939 --> 01:43:55,442
Is this the gun you used to kill
Tommy? Tommy's dead, isn't he?

954
01:43:55,692 --> 01:43:57,193
Don't talk to me about Tommy.

955
01:43:57,694 --> 01:44:01,197
Is this the gun you used
to kill Terry?

956
01:44:01,198 --> 01:44:03,583
I never did nothin'
to Terry.

957
01:44:04,083 --> 01:44:07,587
Whoa! Whoa, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!

958
01:44:07,588 --> 01:44:12,091
Is this the gun you used
on everybody? On me?

959
01:44:14,043 --> 01:44:16,045
Is this a family gun, dad?

960
01:44:16,546 --> 01:44:21,551
Jesus. Put that down.
What's eatin' you?

961
01:44:22,051 --> 01:44:25,438
- You're gonna die. 
- Come on

962
01:44:25,805 --> 01:44:28,308
I know one thing clearer than I've
ever known anything in my entire life,

963
01:44:28,808 --> 01:44:32,812
Except that I loved Terry
before you killed her,

964
01:44:32,813 --> 01:44:34,814
And that is that
you're gonna die.

965
01:44:35,198 --> 01:44:38,201
You got the guts...

966
01:44:38,202 --> 01:44:41,204
To kill... me?

967
01:44:41,704 --> 01:44:44,207
I'm your blood!
I'm your family!

968
01:44:44,324 --> 01:44:45,825
You're not my family.
Not anymore.

969
01:44:46,326 --> 01:44:49,329
Yeah, you're crazy.
Crazy! Gone crazy.

970
01:44:49,330 --> 01:44:52,332
- Nope. 
- Listen! Listen!

971
01:44:52,333 --> 01:44:55,334
- What?
- I know how it is.

972
01:44:55,335 --> 01:44:59,339
Cops got ya in there, get your head
all fucked-Up. I know how that is.

973
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:01,841
My mind's simple, dad.

974
01:45:02,842 --> 01:45:05,344
Before they got you twisted,

975
01:45:05,345 --> 01:45:07,846
You must've known somethin',
you must've felt it.

976
01:45:07,847 --> 01:45:12,852
I gave you money, i gave you a car, I
took you in. Don't that mean somethin'?

977
01:45:12,853 --> 01:45:16,856
Means what?
Means what?

978
01:45:19,108 --> 01:45:23,079
- It means, I got feelin' for ya. 
- What fuckin' feeling?

979
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:26,583
I care. What do ya-
I love you.

980
01:45:26,584 --> 01:45:30,086
What?
Is that what you wanna hear?

981
01:45:30,087 --> 01:45:32,589
- I love you.
- Yeah?

982
01:45:34,340 --> 01:45:36,209
Motherfucker!

983
01:45:40,213 --> 01:45:42,465
I love you too, dad.

984
01:45:45,969 --> 01:45:48,972
Whoa!
Don't!

985
01:46:05,738 --> 01:46:07,740
No.

986
01:46:09,242 --> 01:46:11,744
No, I ain't you.

987
01:46:14,247 --> 01:46:16,749
Besides,
this is too easy.

988
01:46:18,751 --> 01:46:21,254
I want you to die slow.

989
01:46:21,754 --> 01:46:25,642
I want you to die every day
for the rest of your life.

990
01:46:48,414 --> 01:46:49,916
Go on.

991
01:47:25,902 --> 01:47:28,279
- Don't fuckin' move!
- I don't move.

992
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:09,722
Your name?

993
01:49:11,224 --> 01:49:13,142
Bradford Whitewood.

994
01:49:15,144 --> 01:49:17,146
And what do they call you?

995
01:49:18,648 --> 01:49:21,651
Brad, little Brad,
Brad junior.

996
01:49:23,152 --> 01:49:27,156
And is there a Brad senior? 
A big Brad?

997
01:49:35,164 --> 01:49:38,167
- Yes.
- Who is he?

998
01:49:42,672 --> 01:49:45,675
- My father.
- What did you say?

999
01:50:18,658 --> 01:50:20,660
He's my father.

1000
01:50:38,277 --> 01:50:40,595
"I have 

1001
01:50:40,596 --> 01:50:45,101
a tale to tell 

1002
01:50:47,103 --> 01:50:50,106
sometimes it gets so hard

1003
01:50:50,107 --> 01:50:53,609
to hide it well

1004
01:50:57,113 --> 01:51:03,119
I was not ready for the fall

1005
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:10,626
too blind to see the writing
on the wall 

1006
01:51:13,629 --> 01:51:17,132
a man can tell
a thousand lies 

1007
01:51:17,133 --> 01:51:20,636
I've learned
my lesson well 

1008
01:51:21,137 --> 01:51:26,142
hope I live to tell the secre
I have learned 

1009
01:51:26,143 --> 01:51:28,144
till then 

1010
01:51:28,644 --> 01:51:34,650
it will burn inside of me 

1011
01:51:50,166 --> 01:51:52,168
I know 

1012
01:51:52,668 --> 01:51:57,173
where beauty lives 

1013
01:51:59,175 --> 01:52:01,176
I've seen it once 

1014
01:52:01,177 --> 01:52:05,681
I know the warm she gives

1015
01:52:08,684 --> 01:52:14,690
the light that you
could never see 

1016
01:52:16,692 --> 01:52:18,693
it shines inside 

1017
01:52:18,694 --> 01:52:23,699
you can't take that
from me 

1018
01:52:25,701 --> 01:52:29,204
a man can tell
a thousand lies 

1019
01:52:29,205 --> 01:52:32,707
I've learned
my lesson well

till then 

1022
01:52:40,716 --> 01:52:46,722
it will burn inside of me

1023
01:52:49,725 --> 01:52:53,729
the truth is never
far behind 

1024
01:52:53,730 --> 01:52:56,731
you kept it hidden well 

1025
01:52:56,732 --> 01:53:02,238
if I live to tell the secret
I knew then 

1026
01:53:02,239 --> 01:53:04,240
will I 

1027
01:53:04,740 --> 01:53:09,745
ever have the chance again 

1028
01:53:25,761 --> 01:53:28,263
if I ran away 

1029
01:53:28,264 --> 01:53:34,270
I'd never have the strength
to go very far 

1030
01:53:34,271 --> 01:53:36,772
how would they hear 

1031
01:53:37,273 --> 01:53:42,778
the beating of my heart 

1032
01:53:43,279 --> 01:53:45,781
will it grow cold 
will it grow cold 

1033
01:53:46,282 --> 01:53:49,785
the secret that I hide 

1034
01:53:49,786 --> 01:53:51,786
will I grow old 

1035
01:53:51,787 --> 01:53:56,292
how will they hear
when will they learn 

1036
01:53:56,293 --> 01:54:01,297
how will they know 

1037
01:54:10,306 --> 01:54:13,809
a man can tell
a thousand lies 

1038
