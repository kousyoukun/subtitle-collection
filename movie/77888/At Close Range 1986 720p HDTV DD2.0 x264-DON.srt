Hey, Brad! Brad.

3
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:11,538
He took our money.

4
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:14,506
We- We just wanted
a bottle of J.D.,

5
00:05:14,541 --> 00:05:18,045
And he said he'd go in and get it
for us if we gave him the money.

6
00:05:20,047 --> 00:05:23,550
How much money? How much? Five dollars.
He bought himself a bottle of Gin.

7
00:05:29,923 --> 00:05:33,310
- Did you take their money?
- Yeah, I took five dollars.

8
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,813
I was gonna give this to them, but they're
smart-ass kids, and now they're not getting it.

9
00:05:37,314 --> 00:05:40,317
You'll give it back now? No,
i'm not gonna give it back.

10
00:05:40,353 --> 00:05:42,586
You're not gonna
give it back to them?

11
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:44,821
No, I'm not 'cause
this kid's an asshole.

12
00:05:44,856 --> 00:05:46,788
Which one?
The big one.

13
00:05:46,823 --> 00:05:48,825
That's my brother. Yeah.
That's your brother?

14
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,827
Take care of him.
He's too young to drink.

15
00:05:50,862 --> 00:05:52,794
Give him the money back.

16
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:55,332
I'm not giving him the money back,
and what are you gonna do about it?

17
00:05:55,367 --> 00:05:57,334
Fuck you
and fuck them.

18
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:03,840
That's what I thought.
Brad?

19
00:06:10,847 --> 00:06:12,814
Do you?

20
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:14,851
Get off the car,
kid.

21
00:06:17,971 --> 00:06:19,973
You wanna play?

22
00:06:20,975 --> 00:06:23,477
All right.
I can play.

23
00:06:32,736 --> 00:06:37,240
Come on. Get off.
All right, kid.

24
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:40,243
You asked for it.

25
00:06:40,278 --> 00:06:42,996
Faster. Come on.

26
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:45,248
Whoa.

27
00:06:57,762 --> 00:06:59,763
Get off,
you nutcase.

28
00:07:09,406 --> 00:07:11,908
All right, kid, come on.
Get off of the car.

29
00:07:15,413 --> 00:07:18,915
- What do you want?
- The five.

30
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,422
Now get off the car,
all right?

31
00:07:28,425 --> 00:07:30,927
Now what do you want?

32
00:07:31,429 --> 00:07:34,396
- The gin.
- I gave you the five.

33
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:39,936
Hey, man, you know,
we got your license plates.

34
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,477
Now will you
get off the car?

35
00:07:50,982 --> 00:07:52,983
You're weird, kid.
You know that?

36
00:08:05,496 --> 00:08:07,963
That was
fucking great, man.

37
00:08:07,998 --> 00:08:12,002
I liked it. Drink your
gin, get in the truck.

38
00:08:12,037 --> 00:08:15,005
Don't you want
some of this?

39
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,007
Come on, man.

40
00:08:18,592 --> 00:08:21,595
Nice move, man.

41
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:28,351
Hi.

42
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:30,855
Hello.

43
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:34,357
Is this your friend?

44
00:08:34,392 --> 00:08:36,359
Yeah, Jill.

45
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,863
Jill. Hi, Jill.

46
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:41,865
Hi.

47
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:44,868
You got a name?

48
00:08:44,904 --> 00:08:48,336
Brad?

49
00:08:48,371 --> 00:08:51,374
You don't sound so sure.

50
00:08:57,381 --> 00:08:59,882
Oh, I'm Terry.

51
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,385
Terry. Hi.

52
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:10,393
You have
a really nice smile.

53
00:09:11,895 --> 00:09:15,398
Thanks.

54
00:09:31,798 --> 00:09:33,800
Terry doesn't take drugs.

55
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:36,768
What are they?

56
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:40,807
I don't really know.
They make things stronger.

57
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:43,276
What is that
supposed to mean?

58
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:47,815
Whatever you feel, it
makes you feel it stronger.

59
00:10:02,829 --> 00:10:04,831
Brad!

60
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:07,584
Just get her phone number
and come on.

61
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:09,953
Just get
her phone number.

62
00:10:10,453 --> 00:10:12,420
Who's that?

63
00:10:12,455 --> 00:10:15,458
My brother and his partner.
I gotta drive them, I guess.

64
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:21,965
Will I see you
down here again?

65
00:10:23,968 --> 00:10:25,969
I don't know.

66
00:10:27,972 --> 00:10:30,473
Well, where
will I see you?

67
00:10:30,508 --> 00:10:32,976
Um,

68
00:10:33,476 --> 00:10:37,981
Well, I guess I could be
here, like, day after tomorrow.

69
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:40,448
All right.

70
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:43,988
Well, I'll see you then.

71
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:48,491
Okay.
Okay.

72
00:10:49,492 --> 00:10:51,494
Bye.

73
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:58,850
Ooh-hoo.
Bradford.

74
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:01,388
Did you tell her
your name was Bradford?

75
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:24,542
The Toyota SR-5.

76
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:26,579
The truck that feels
like a sports car.

77
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,707
O-O-Oh, what a feeling

78
00:11:29,742 --> 00:11:32,336
To drive... Toyota

79
00:11:33,955 --> 00:11:35,956
Hey, Brad.

80
00:11:37,457 --> 00:11:41,461
You're always trying to go out
with those real pretty women.

81
00:11:42,963 --> 00:11:44,965
All they got
is a cunt.

82
00:11:46,466 --> 00:11:48,433
They're all the same.

83
00:11:48,469 --> 00:11:52,973
They tell you they want you
to- To talk nice...

84
00:11:53,473 --> 00:11:55,941
And act nice.

85
00:11:55,976 --> 00:11:57,943
Hello!
Yeah, come on in.

86
00:11:57,978 --> 00:11:59,980
All they got is
a goddamned cunt.

87
00:12:16,212 --> 00:12:18,180
What you doing?

88
00:12:18,214 --> 00:12:21,584
My truck's
all fucked up.

89
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:26,155
Is she home?

90
00:12:26,191 --> 00:12:29,225
No. No.

91
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:33,229
Now who's that?

92
00:12:40,354 --> 00:12:42,355
I wanna give her
some money.

93
00:12:42,391 --> 00:12:44,823
Goddamn.
Huh?

94
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:47,360
I said,
"she could sure use it."

95
00:12:47,395 --> 00:12:49,863
So, what do you think,
a hundred?

96
00:12:50,363 --> 00:12:53,366
Two, three? What?

97
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:59,873
Brad.
Yeah.

98
00:12:59,908 --> 00:13:01,840
Tommy?

99
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,127
No.

100
00:13:04,162 --> 00:13:06,379
Ah.

101
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:09,883
See ya.

102
00:13:15,388 --> 00:13:17,390
How old are you now,
anyway?

103
00:13:17,425 --> 00:13:19,859
Old enough.

104
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,861
Damn.

105
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:48,721
Do you know
where he's living at?

106
00:13:49,222 --> 00:13:51,841
I don't care.

107
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:58,349
He's up in Homeville.

108
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:09,275
Little Brad...

109
00:14:11,277 --> 00:14:13,279
Don't even think
about it.

110
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:27,820
Is that my beer
you're drinking?

111
00:15:28,321 --> 00:15:31,824
There's a Colt 45.
You can't afford it.

112
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:36,829
You know, that shit you guys are
smoking is gonna rot your brains,

113
00:15:36,864 --> 00:15:39,333
But I guess in your case, that
ain't no damage done, is it?

114
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:01,686
Why don't you get a
job, boy? I tried that.

115
00:16:01,721 --> 00:16:05,225
You quit as soon as you paid off that
damn truck, didn't you? That's right.

116
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,727
We ain't all got it so lucky
around here, you know?

117
00:16:08,194 --> 00:16:10,196
You see your mom in there. She's gotta work
in the morning. Your grandma's gotta work.

118
00:16:10,697 --> 00:16:13,650
But more important, I gotta work
tomorrow, and I need some sleep.

119
00:16:14,151 --> 00:16:17,121
You turn that damn thing on again,
and I'll beat the Jesus out of you.

120
00:16:19,622 --> 00:16:21,624
There ain't no Jesus
in me.

121
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:25,129
Go to bed, Tommy.

122
00:16:26,129 --> 00:16:30,098
Look, Ernie.
This here is my house.

123
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:34,137
You lived here four years. Before that
Rising Sun, six, before that, Jennersville.

124
00:16:34,172 --> 00:16:36,639
You've been five months with her.
You don't ever tell me what to do.

125
00:16:36,675 --> 00:16:40,760
Ernie. Ernie!

126
00:16:41,761 --> 00:16:43,763
All right, enough.

127
00:16:43,798 --> 00:16:45,765
You little son of a-

128
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:35,782
Yeah, Homeville. Number for
Bradford Whitewood sr., please.

129
00:17:39,786 --> 00:17:43,289
I guess you must have heard
about me or something.

130
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,758
I guess.

131
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:48,795
What'd you hear?

132
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:52,299
I heard you was a thief.

133
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,766
What do you think
about that?

134
00:17:54,801 --> 00:17:57,769
Looks like you make
pretty good money at it.

135
00:17:57,805 --> 00:18:00,807
Well, to some folks, I'm just
the devil in blue suede shoes.

136
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,809
Don't you believe it, okay?

137
00:18:02,844 --> 00:18:04,776
Okay.

138
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:07,779
I never stole
nothing, hear?

139
00:18:07,814 --> 00:18:09,816
Yeah. Don't you worry about
getting a speeding ticket?

140
00:18:10,316 --> 00:18:12,819
Kid, you look a thousand
miles any direction...

141
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:15,787
From tennessee
to toronto,

142
00:18:15,822 --> 00:18:17,789
I go back roads
just about anyplace.

143
00:18:17,824 --> 00:18:21,327
Never touch the interstate.
Never see one goddamn cop.

144
00:18:21,362 --> 00:18:23,329
Besides, this ain't fast.

145
00:18:30,837 --> 00:18:32,839
Hello?

146
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:37,343
That's my son.

147
00:18:39,345 --> 00:18:41,848
It's Brad.

148
00:18:42,348 --> 00:18:44,351
He'll be staying
with us...

149
00:18:44,851 --> 00:18:46,854
A couple-
A few weeks.

150
00:18:47,854 --> 00:18:49,856
This is
your uncle Dickie.

151
00:18:51,357 --> 00:18:54,862
- Uncle Patch.
- Hi, kid.

152
00:18:54,896 --> 00:18:57,862
That's boyd.

153
00:18:57,897 --> 00:19:00,367
Tony Pine.
He's epileptic.

154
00:19:04,371 --> 00:19:07,356
They're sort of
part of the family.

155
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:11,878
And, uh,
my sister and mother.

156
00:19:12,379 --> 00:19:14,380
That's Mary Sue.

157
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,382
Hi, Brad jr.

158
00:19:16,883 --> 00:19:19,502
Mary Sue's about five
years older than you.

159
00:19:22,004 --> 00:19:25,391
- You're own family.
- We're late.

160
00:19:35,401 --> 00:19:38,906
Mary Sue, show him
that room we got.

161
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,907
Hell, he's cute.

162
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,911
See you tomorrow.

163
00:19:58,175 --> 00:19:59,675
I didn't know
you had a son, Brad.

164
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:02,143
Got two.
Sort of.

165
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:06,682
Old Braddy went to prison. Julie started
dickin' some grease monkey from willerton.

166
00:20:07,183 --> 00:20:09,685
Nine months later,
out popped Tommy.

167
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:14,690
What exactly
are you saying?

168
00:20:15,191 --> 00:20:18,694
Nothing. Nothing.
I didn't say nothing.

169
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:21,662
Just one thing here.

170
00:20:21,697 --> 00:20:24,200
You don't say nothing
against the family.

171
00:20:24,236 --> 00:20:26,668
Okay.

172
00:20:26,702 --> 00:20:29,205
Let's go to work.

173
00:20:31,207 --> 00:20:34,211
So, uh, where'd
they go, anyway?

174
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:52,345
One's coming.

175
00:20:55,983 --> 00:20:57,484
Okay, I hear it.

176
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:48,619
Patch, what's that car?

177
00:21:53,623 --> 00:21:55,625
Brad.

178
00:21:59,128 --> 00:22:01,381
Brad, we lost our lookout. Yo.

179
00:22:01,881 --> 00:22:03,499
I think your brother's out there
pinching hubcaps or something.

180
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:06,135
I'll stay
where I can hear you.

181
00:22:26,022 --> 00:22:29,525
- Hundreds?
- Twenties.

182
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:56,936
You remind me of a guy
i knew in high school.

183
00:22:58,938 --> 00:23:01,941
Only he was
a real doofus.

184
00:23:05,945 --> 00:23:07,947
Go for a ride?

185
00:23:07,982 --> 00:23:09,914
Sure.

186
00:23:09,949 --> 00:23:14,454
Gimme that foot.
Gimme those little piggies.

187
00:23:14,488 --> 00:23:16,455
Mmm.

188
00:23:21,961 --> 00:23:23,963
Time to do some laundry.

189
00:23:46,986 --> 00:23:48,989
Kid, you like pussy?

190
00:23:49,488 --> 00:23:51,956
Yeah.
Smart boy.

191
00:23:51,991 --> 00:23:54,494
What's the sexiest thing you ever
thought of in your whole life?

192
00:23:54,994 --> 00:23:56,495
Excuse me. Can I help you? Yeah.

193
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:59,999
You got- You got, what,
$5,500 on that car?

194
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:04,870
I'll give you five...
cash.

195
00:24:06,456 --> 00:24:09,091
Do I drive her out?

196
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,623
What are we doing here?

197
00:24:40,658 --> 00:24:42,625
Laundry.

198
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:52,134
You know that truck of mine's
gone punk dead.

199
00:24:52,169 --> 00:24:56,138
I could sure use a slick
car sometime. Maybe.

200
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:59,642
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Yeah.

201
00:24:59,678 --> 00:25:02,144
I just bought
this car...

202
00:25:02,179 --> 00:25:04,163
For 5,500.

203
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:06,113
It's a cherry.

204
00:25:06,148 --> 00:25:09,770
- Would you give me 46 for her?
- Why are you selling it?

205
00:25:10,019 --> 00:25:13,023
I don't like the radio.

206
00:25:37,129 --> 00:25:39,381
You're kidding.
No.

207
00:25:39,882 --> 00:25:43,385
Mom said, "that's my son.
Nobody touches my son."

208
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:45,888
And she threw his suitcase
down the stairs.

209
00:25:45,923 --> 00:25:47,890
I wish I'd seen that.

210
00:25:49,391 --> 00:25:53,861
Brad, when are you
gonna come home?

211
00:25:53,896 --> 00:25:56,398
I don't know. I'm hoping
dad might give me something.

212
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,901
Yeah? What?

213
00:26:01,904 --> 00:26:05,908
Hey, Jill. Jill.
Hey, Terry's friend.

214
00:27:42,254 --> 00:27:45,758
Hi.
Hi.

215
00:27:46,009 --> 00:27:49,011
You scared the hell out of me. Sorry.

216
00:27:49,144 --> 00:27:51,397
Well, thanks
for coming out.

217
00:27:51,431 --> 00:27:53,649
I can only stay
a minute.

218
00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:56,652
Oh, well,
your friend, Jill,

219
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:59,154
Didn't know if you wanted
to come out at all.

220
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:01,273
Jill.

221
00:28:08,414 --> 00:28:10,416
So, you do
remember me, huh?

222
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:14,420
- Sure.
- You were supposed to meet me, you know, that night.

223
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:16,922
I know. My mother
wouldn't let me out.

224
00:28:17,289 --> 00:28:21,793
And then I tried to sneak out,
and she caught me.

225
00:28:21,828 --> 00:28:26,298
Really? Yeah. She
grounded me for two weeks.

226
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:30,687
She says until I'm 17,
i can only go out-

227
00:28:31,186 --> 00:28:35,307
- You're only 16?
- Yeah, so?

228
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:41,063
I thought about
your smile a lot.

229
00:28:41,314 --> 00:28:44,817
I thought about you too.

230
00:28:50,073 --> 00:28:52,074
Jill says
your last name's Whitewood?

231
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:54,077
Yeah.

232
00:28:56,579 --> 00:28:58,546
Your father's
got kind of a rep.

233
00:28:58,580 --> 00:29:02,400
Well, yeah. Don't believe
everything you hear.

234
00:29:02,436 --> 00:29:06,186
- Terry.
- Oh, shit. I gotta go.

235
00:29:06,221 --> 00:29:11,728
Wait a minute. Jill didn't
give me your number or anything.

236
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:14,695
555-6239.

237
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:17,699
555-6239.
Three-nine.

238
00:29:17,733 --> 00:29:19,736
Yeah, okay. Wait. Don't go yet.

239
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:22,004
Um-
Terry?

240
00:29:22,039 --> 00:29:24,239
I gotta go.

241
00:29:36,251 --> 00:29:37,753
Bye.

242
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:42,725
Ha!

243
00:29:52,184 --> 00:29:55,687
Hey, Patch, how come you
don't go out with them anymore?

244
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,691
The other guys.

245
00:30:01,193 --> 00:30:03,695
'Cause your daddy's
a dickface.

246
00:30:03,812 --> 00:30:06,815
Don't want me
having no money.

247
00:30:07,317 --> 00:30:09,783
Don't want me
having no fun.

248
00:30:09,819 --> 00:30:12,821
One day, I'm gonna have
my own empire.

249
00:30:14,323 --> 00:30:16,790
I'm gonna steal
everything.

250
00:30:16,825 --> 00:30:19,794
- Wanna help me?
- I don't know.

251
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:23,332
Sure you can. You ever
steal a police car?

252
00:30:23,582 --> 00:30:26,935
No.

253
00:30:26,969 --> 00:30:28,936
Me neither.

254
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:31,974
Hey, we could steal a whole
lot of stuff, you and me.

255
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:36,478
There's no sense sitting around a
dump like this, wasting our time.

256
00:30:36,514 --> 00:30:39,481
I heard that. I mean, there's
a world out there waiting.

257
00:30:39,516 --> 00:30:41,448
Tell you what.

258
00:30:41,483 --> 00:30:45,487
Let's you and me
go in the next room...

259
00:30:45,988 --> 00:30:49,992
And start sniffing
some ideas.

260
00:30:50,027 --> 00:30:51,994
Let's go.

261
00:30:56,615 --> 00:30:59,118
"Ideas" is
my middle name.

262
00:31:09,879 --> 00:31:11,880
What do you think?

263
00:31:12,014 --> 00:31:14,016
It's fuckin' beautiful.

264
00:31:14,516 --> 00:31:16,518
It's a piece of shit,
but it's yours.

265
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:21,989
Is it legal?
Yes, it's legal.

266
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:24,526
There's parts on it
borrowed, but...

267
00:31:26,028 --> 00:31:28,996
Registration's clean.

268
00:31:29,032 --> 00:31:31,498
Don't never say
i done nothing for you.

269
00:31:31,534 --> 00:31:34,903
Just don't know
if I could ever pay you back.

270
00:31:40,909 --> 00:31:43,912
Try this.
Stay clear of my brother.

271
00:31:43,947 --> 00:31:46,415
Which one?

272
00:31:46,915 --> 00:31:49,418
You know damn well,
boy.

273
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:56,391
Okay. It's a good way for me to make some
money, you know? It's something I can do.

274
00:31:56,893 --> 00:31:59,144
You two jackasses,
you'll both end up in jail.

275
00:31:59,179 --> 00:32:01,361
Then, you teach me.
You show me what to do.

276
00:32:01,396 --> 00:32:05,400
If I'm gonna learn, I should learn
right, from you. I got no time.

277
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:08,154
Just to show me?

278
00:32:08,654 --> 00:32:10,138
Don't seem right.

279
00:32:10,606 --> 00:32:13,610
Come on, dad.
I get some guys together.

280
00:32:13,644 --> 00:32:15,611
I don't know.
We'll see.

281
00:32:20,115 --> 00:32:23,869
You better go on home.

282
00:32:23,904 --> 00:32:26,764
To your mother's.
Yeah.

283
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,626
I don't know why, but...

284
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:33,128
You make Mary Sue
awful skittish.

285
00:33:09,164 --> 00:33:11,131
Five.
I'm going to bed.

286
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,133
Ten, eleven, two, three
- Wait!

287
00:33:13,168 --> 00:33:17,172
Wait, wait. Julie, wait. You've got
- Mom.

288
00:33:17,207 --> 00:33:20,676
Okay, she left.
Hold on. Six, seven.

289
00:33:21,176 --> 00:33:23,679
Six plus five... is eleven. Is 11.

290
00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:25,681
One, two, three, four...

291
00:33:26,181 --> 00:33:28,684
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, eleven.

292
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:31,652
My property.
No problem.

293
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:33,939
Now we're gonna split
her property up.

294
00:33:33,974 --> 00:33:36,334
I'll take boardwalk and park place. No.

295
00:33:36,369 --> 00:33:38,659
You can take-
No, I want boardwalk.

296
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:41,697
No, see, grandma,
if you take this property,

297
00:33:42,197 --> 00:33:45,393
You'll have a hotel on each, and
there's better odds of landing on it.

298
00:33:45,427 --> 00:33:48,587
No, I want boardwalk. 'Cause there's
three of them and there's only-

299
00:33:56,095 --> 00:33:59,062
Big Brad, you know,

300
00:33:59,097 --> 00:34:03,101
When I married him, he had
the biggest eyes you ever saw,

301
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,604
And he courted me
like a regular gentleman.

302
00:34:06,606 --> 00:34:09,107
With flowers
and everything.

303
00:34:11,109 --> 00:34:13,612
Good night,
little Brad.

304
00:34:13,647 --> 00:34:15,614
Good night.

305
00:34:26,626 --> 00:34:31,545
Hey, Brad.
Are you awake?

306
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:35,083
There's a girl
on the phone.

307
00:34:53,735 --> 00:34:57,239
I'd better get you home before
your mother starts to worry.

308
00:34:59,741 --> 00:35:01,743
It's nice to meet you.
Likewise.

309
00:35:01,778 --> 00:35:04,113
Good-bye.

310
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:28,103
What's he like?

311
00:35:31,107 --> 00:35:33,108
Who?

312
00:36:22,824 --> 00:36:25,444
Find one there.

313
00:36:27,446 --> 00:36:29,448
Find one right there.

314
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:32,452
Back in there too.

315
00:36:35,337 --> 00:36:37,555
How can you tell?

316
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:41,093
Size of the lawn,
size of the stroke.

317
00:36:42,093 --> 00:36:45,029
Regular mower cuts
about a foot wide.

318
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:47,966
Good tractor
do you three or four.

319
00:36:49,468 --> 00:36:52,472
See, most people
that drive through here,

320
00:36:52,506 --> 00:36:54,938
They see farms,

321
00:36:54,973 --> 00:36:58,443
Houses and fields
and shit.

322
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,979
I see money. Everywhere
i go I see money.

323
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:05,984
I see things that can move. Anything
can move, it's got my name written on it.

324
00:37:06,019 --> 00:37:09,488
"Brad Whitewood, please hold
for the delivery."

325
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:16,710
- My name too.
- Yeah, little bastard.

326
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:21,883
Oh, wait, I forgot.
You's the bastard, ain't ya?

327
00:37:22,133 --> 00:37:25,003
Hey.

328
00:37:25,387 --> 00:37:28,104
I didn't mean
nothing by it.

329
00:37:28,139 --> 00:37:31,142
I swear I didn't mean
nothing by it.

330
00:37:37,399 --> 00:37:40,402
One day, you know what?
You know what I'm gonna do?

331
00:37:43,022 --> 00:37:45,407
Give you guys a present.

332
00:37:57,536 --> 00:38:00,539
What do you think
of that?

333
00:38:00,672 --> 00:38:02,674
Looks like
a pretty nice gun.

334
00:38:03,159 --> 00:38:05,677
Fuckin' A-plus,
it's a nice gun.

335
00:38:05,713 --> 00:38:09,715
It's 350, retail.

336
00:38:11,967 --> 00:38:17,022
I got a good price on mine.
Real good. Wanna touch it?

337
00:38:17,057 --> 00:38:19,024
Can I?
Is that all right?

338
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:29,569
- Do you like it?
- I like it a lot.

339
00:38:29,603 --> 00:38:31,570
You can't have it.
It's mine.

340
00:38:42,714 --> 00:38:45,682
I already
give you a car.

341
00:38:45,717 --> 00:38:49,721
That don't mean nothing. I
gotta see something in you.

342
00:38:49,756 --> 00:38:53,709
I gotta see you got
something... right here...

343
00:38:54,726 --> 00:38:57,611
Between the legs,

344
00:38:57,646 --> 00:39:00,597
Then I'll give you
a real present.

345
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:03,151
You wanna see
we got something?

346
00:39:03,652 --> 00:39:07,155
We'll show you something. We'll
show you something tonight.

347
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:10,525
Yeah?
Hey, Brad.

348
00:39:12,027 --> 00:39:14,412
How's it going?

349
00:39:16,031 --> 00:39:19,535
- These your new recruits?
- These are my sons, lester.

350
00:39:19,569 --> 00:39:22,037
Oh, well,

351
00:39:22,537 --> 00:39:26,041
You boys have
a very interesting family.

352
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,759
Get out of my face,
lester.

353
00:39:28,793 --> 00:39:32,298
For instance, remember when
we stole those muskets...

354
00:39:32,332 --> 00:39:34,399
From the
revolutionary war museum?

355
00:39:34,883 --> 00:39:38,386
Of course, dickie conked out
that, uh, janitor, making it...

356
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:40,657
Grand larceny,
aggravated assault.

357
00:39:40,691 --> 00:39:42,891
But it was a good time,
right, Brad?

358
00:39:46,394 --> 00:39:48,361
Oh, yeah, you're smart.

359
00:39:48,396 --> 00:39:51,865
You don't wanna talk to me.
Come on, Brad.

360
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,954
I wanna work with you again.
I need some of that action.

361
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,922
Why, so you can tell
the cops?

362
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:02,961
Cops? Ain't so bad.
Just doing their job.

363
00:40:03,462 --> 00:40:06,464
Just kidding.

364
00:40:10,385 --> 00:40:13,888
Okay, I know.
I'm going.

365
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:17,892
I'm going. I'm gone.

366
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:26,351
The boy ain't got the life
expectancy of a housefly.

367
00:41:16,985 --> 00:41:19,454
Like this one time, Patch goes
into this jewelry store, right?

368
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:21,922
He asks to see
this $500 watch.

369
00:41:21,956 --> 00:41:23,766
So, the lady,
she shows it to him, all right,

370
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,577
But she don't wanna take
her paws off it.

371
00:41:26,077 --> 00:41:28,546
He's tuggin' one direction,
she's tuggin' the other direction.

372
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:32,584
Finally, pulls up his sleeve, he
goes, "lady, mine's worth a thousand.

373
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,587
Why the hell
would I want yours?"

374
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:38,840
This makes sense to her, right? So,
she takes her hands off the thing.

375
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:41,342
He grabs the son of a bitch and
hightails it out of the store.

376
00:41:41,843 --> 00:41:44,846
Shit!
Something's coming.

377
00:42:14,627 --> 00:42:17,128
Oh, what a feeling

378
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:20,481
Don't stop
oh, what a feeling

379
00:42:20,515 --> 00:42:24,018
Tomorrow, tomorrow
oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling

380
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:27,522
Toyota

381
00:43:01,924 --> 00:43:05,426
Hurry up! We gotta get this
stuff to a truck stop before dawn.

382
00:43:05,461 --> 00:43:07,895
Yo, Brad!
Yo!

383
00:43:07,929 --> 00:43:10,897
Telephone!
All right.

384
00:43:10,932 --> 00:43:14,936
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty. You're one to talk. Hey!

385
00:43:20,942 --> 00:43:23,444
Make it spicy, Rose.

386
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:30,952
Yo, what you got?

387
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:33,338
Shot.
Say again.

388
00:43:33,838 --> 00:43:36,342
Shot. I got shot, man.
Birdshot in the face.

389
00:43:36,841 --> 00:43:39,844
Bad?
Well, it hurts.

390
00:43:42,347 --> 00:43:45,350
- Get any tractors?
- No.

391
00:43:47,852 --> 00:43:52,358
- Go on home, then.
- I can't. Not with my face like this.

392
00:43:52,857 --> 00:43:55,860
You can't go to my place
if that's what you're asking.

393
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:58,864
Mary Sue, me, we're here,
we're helping out... late.

394
00:44:00,865 --> 00:44:02,832
Be at it all night.

395
00:44:02,868 --> 00:44:05,870
Can I come
where you're at?

396
00:44:07,372 --> 00:44:09,374
You got a woman...

397
00:44:10,375 --> 00:44:12,377
Someplace.

398
00:44:53,585 --> 00:44:57,038
I want you both downstairs with
your clothes on in five minutes.

399
00:44:57,539 --> 00:44:59,540
Do you hear me, Terry?

400
00:45:40,331 --> 00:45:42,334
Whoo!

401
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:28,072
Sorry.

402
00:47:36,615 --> 00:47:38,616
Hey.

403
00:47:42,370 --> 00:47:44,372
Wake up.

404
00:47:54,882 --> 00:47:59,421
You know, I know my mom.
She's not gonna sit there.

405
00:48:01,055 --> 00:48:03,858
She's gonna call the cops
after me.

406
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:14,902
I mean,
what are we gonna do?

407
00:48:17,722 --> 00:48:20,291
We got $18 left.

408
00:48:24,745 --> 00:48:27,081
I'm gonna have to
go home.

409
00:48:41,146 --> 00:48:43,130
Listen.

410
00:48:46,651 --> 00:48:50,186
If we can sometime,

411
00:48:50,221 --> 00:48:52,872
You wanna go somewhere?

412
00:48:52,907 --> 00:48:54,976
Get our own place
together?

413
00:48:58,229 --> 00:49:00,448
Okay.

414
00:49:01,949 --> 00:49:03,952
You mean it?

415
00:49:04,952 --> 00:49:06,671
Sure.

416
00:49:09,073 --> 00:49:11,125
I mean it.
Okay.

417
00:49:12,176 --> 00:49:15,279
It might take a little while,
but I can do it.

418
00:49:17,298 --> 00:49:19,432
How?

419
00:49:19,467 --> 00:49:22,270
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

420
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:24,273
I worry about it.

421
00:49:29,261 --> 00:49:34,198
If you're thinkin'
you're too cool to boogie

422
00:49:36,701 --> 00:49:40,572
Boy, oh, boy
have I got news for you

423
00:49:44,576 --> 00:49:50,081
Everybody here tonight
must boogie

424
00:49:50,116 --> 00:49:53,549
And right there,
sitting on my lap...

425
00:49:53,584 --> 00:49:57,588
was the most beautiful woman
you guys ever seen in your life.

426
00:49:57,623 --> 00:50:02,058
Mm-hmm. Beautiful? She was a hooker.

427
00:50:02,093 --> 00:50:08,099
She wasn't a hooker.
She was a... architect.

428
00:50:08,134 --> 00:50:10,066
Oh, boogie

429
00:50:10,101 --> 00:50:12,603
Boogie no more
some big firm in Philly.

430
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:16,572
You can't boogie no more

431
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:20,076
Boogie
boogie no more

432
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:22,113
Listen to the music except
for the assholes and the faggots,

433
00:50:22,613 --> 00:50:24,115
I'm the richest son of a bitch
in this county.

434
00:50:24,615 --> 00:50:27,002
Mind if I sit down?

435
00:50:28,502 --> 00:50:31,006
I want you to taste something
'cause I saw you sitting there.

436
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:34,008
Yeah, see now.

437
00:50:34,043 --> 00:50:35,975
Yeah.

438
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:39,513
Private stock.
There's no time to waste

439
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:42,516
Let's get this show
on the road

440
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,487
Were you here last week, hustling? No.

441
00:50:47,521 --> 00:50:52,026
I thought I saw you last week. Wait just
a minute. I need some I.D. on the lady.

442
00:50:52,061 --> 00:50:54,528
I shall return.
The sooner we begin

443
00:50:54,563 --> 00:50:56,363
Get outta here.
Andy, that's my son.

444
00:50:56,397 --> 00:50:59,900
Hell, Brad, I can't
- Yeah, this girl, she's 23.

445
00:51:00,401 --> 00:51:05,406
Listen to the music
and let your body move

446
00:51:05,441 --> 00:51:08,176
Dad, this is Terry.
Hi.

447
00:51:08,211 --> 00:51:10,812
Hi.
You treat my boy right.

448
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:13,414
I will.

449
00:51:13,449 --> 00:51:15,381
I do.

450
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:19,420
Come on. Sit down.
Make yourself at home.

451
00:51:28,429 --> 00:51:32,683
Listen, Terry? That's Patch. Yeah.

452
00:51:36,188 --> 00:51:39,323
Dickie. Boyd.

453
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,111
Tony Pine. He's epileptic.
What you drinking?

454
00:51:42,611 --> 00:51:45,579
I'm fine. Thanks.
You're overage.

455
00:51:45,614 --> 00:51:49,583
She's 42.

456
00:51:50,084 --> 00:51:53,145
I'll have a Rolling Rock. Hmm.

457
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:55,694
I'll have
a whiskey sour.

458
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:58,209
Whiskey sour?
They're good.

459
00:51:58,244 --> 00:52:01,212
Yeah.

460
00:52:01,712 --> 00:52:05,216
We're real glad to get to meet
you, Terry. What do you think...

461
00:52:05,349 --> 00:52:07,852
Now that you get to see us
all in the flesh?

462
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:12,723
I don't know.
Heard a lot about you.

463
00:52:13,107 --> 00:52:16,110
- Nice things?
- You ain't done nothin' nice, Brad.

464
00:52:16,145 --> 00:52:18,112
I hope not.

465
00:52:19,113 --> 00:52:21,115
What'd you hear?

466
00:52:21,482 --> 00:52:23,484
Different things.

467
00:52:25,870 --> 00:52:31,375
Dad, we wanna talk to you
for a moment.

468
00:52:39,633 --> 00:52:41,635
I came here 'cause I wanted
to ask you about this.

469
00:52:41,670 --> 00:52:44,103
See, Terry and I,
we wanna live together.

470
00:52:44,138 --> 00:52:47,641
We wanna get a place like that.
It's gonna cost some real money.

471
00:52:49,143 --> 00:52:51,145
So, I wanna join up
with you guys.

472
00:52:52,897 --> 00:52:54,899
Just temporarily.

473
00:53:12,416 --> 00:53:14,383
Fine. Fine.

474
00:53:14,418 --> 00:53:16,886
You don't have to
let him in.

475
00:53:16,921 --> 00:53:19,924
But you know,
he's better than you.

476
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:43,063
Would you excuse us?

477
00:53:44,565 --> 00:53:46,567
It's all right.

478
00:53:54,325 --> 00:53:57,293
That's not right.

479
00:53:57,328 --> 00:54:00,831
You wanna talk to me?
You talk to me in private.

480
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:04,335
I'll tell you something.
That girl is trouble.

481
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:06,802
She's nice, she's young,
big mouth.

482
00:54:06,837 --> 00:54:10,341
You stick with us. You stick by
me. You can see this is a group.

483
00:54:10,376 --> 00:54:12,343
You know,
you don't violate that.

484
00:54:14,845 --> 00:54:16,812
Take her home.

485
00:54:16,847 --> 00:54:20,199
Don't ever do that again.

486
00:54:20,234 --> 00:54:23,737
Okay? Don't worry about it.
It's okay.

487
00:54:23,772 --> 00:54:25,739
And look.

488
00:54:29,243 --> 00:54:31,245
Everything
will work out fine.

489
00:54:32,246 --> 00:54:34,248
Yeah.

490
00:54:35,749 --> 00:54:38,252
Okay.

491
00:54:38,752 --> 00:54:40,254
Sorry.

492
00:54:57,021 --> 00:54:59,523
Go ahead.
What else?

493
00:55:01,025 --> 00:55:04,528
Well, this group of guys,
whatever you call it...

494
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:09,533
Goes all over the country, huh? Yeah.

495
00:55:09,568 --> 00:55:12,553
And it's organized?

496
00:55:12,588 --> 00:55:15,504
Organized?
Yeah.

497
00:55:15,539 --> 00:55:18,042
Enough.
It's just guys, you know.

498
00:55:18,542 --> 00:55:21,510
I know guys,
and Tony Pine knows some.

499
00:55:21,545 --> 00:55:23,547
Boyd, my brothers,
everybody knows some people.

500
00:55:23,582 --> 00:55:26,050
These people
know people.

501
00:55:26,085 --> 00:55:28,517
Before you know it,

502
00:55:28,552 --> 00:55:30,554
You know everybody you gotta
know to get the job done.

503
00:55:30,589 --> 00:55:32,556
That's it.

504
00:55:34,058 --> 00:55:36,025
How do you keep cops
off your ass?

505
00:55:36,060 --> 00:55:39,563
I got a friend
who reads the police memos.

506
00:55:39,598 --> 00:55:43,032
For instance, they
just got this report...

507
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:47,071
There's more tractors stolen in
Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania-

508
00:55:47,106 --> 00:55:50,574
That's us
- Than all the other 47 states together.

509
00:55:50,609 --> 00:55:54,078
Makes the cops around here
kinda peppy, so...

510
00:55:54,113 --> 00:55:56,580
We lay off tractors
for a while.

511
00:55:56,615 --> 00:55:58,582
Anything else?

512
00:56:01,201 --> 00:56:04,672
Why are you letting me ask you
all this? 'Cause you gotta know.

513
00:56:05,172 --> 00:56:07,675
I gotta make sure you walk
into this with your eyes wide...

514
00:56:08,175 --> 00:56:10,678
And know what you're doing
and who you're with.

515
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,182
Especially, you know,
it's a family situation.

516
00:56:23,023 --> 00:56:25,025
You go out with us
once or twice.

517
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:26,992
See how it is,
then you decide.

518
00:56:27,027 --> 00:56:31,532
If you still want it
- 'Cause if you do, that's it.

519
00:56:33,033 --> 00:56:36,036
It's blood.
Don't break it.

520
00:56:58,171 --> 00:57:01,174
Don't want none.
Here you go, Dickie.

521
00:57:49,589 --> 00:57:52,408
The caretaker's light
just went on.

522
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:55,228
Okay, don't move at all!
Don't move.

523
00:58:13,747 --> 00:58:16,249
Good.
Good goin', kid.

524
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,722
Bye-bye.

525
00:58:24,224 --> 00:58:26,410
Go, go, go!

526
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:29,513
You know what?
I've been thinking.

527
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:32,481
I oughta sign up
at the university.

528
00:58:32,516 --> 00:58:34,518
Hey, that's a real good idea,
Patch. That's real swift.

529
00:58:35,018 --> 00:58:39,272
No, no, no, no, no. Take
one of them art courses.

530
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:42,668
We go into a joint like that,
must be t-t-trillions-

531
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:46,029
Hundreds of trillions of dollars
hanging on the wall.

532
00:58:46,163 --> 00:58:48,665
And we're too dumb
to know which ones to take.

533
00:58:49,166 --> 00:58:52,169
Take the ugly ones. Uglier
they are, more they're worth.

534
00:58:52,204 --> 00:58:54,171
That's right.

535
00:59:02,179 --> 00:59:04,681
What? You showed me something tonight.

536
00:59:05,182 --> 00:59:07,184
What?
My own blood.

537
00:59:07,684 --> 00:59:09,553
Am I right?

538
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,444
- You're gonna make it.
- Heard that.

539
00:59:17,811 --> 00:59:21,913
Lookie here.

540
00:59:21,948 --> 00:59:25,952
Good ol' detective Mosker.

541
00:59:26,453 --> 00:59:28,455
He's really got class.

542
00:59:32,959 --> 00:59:34,961
Havin' hamburger steak.

543
00:59:38,465 --> 00:59:40,967
Well, hello.

544
01:00:18,922 --> 01:00:20,924
See ya later.

545
01:00:23,426 --> 01:00:28,431
Oh, I know. Did you hear about that
girl that was eight before she was seven?

546
01:00:28,466 --> 01:00:32,936
Oop, I hate
those short eyes jokes.

547
01:00:33,937 --> 01:00:35,904
Look who waited up.

548
01:00:35,939 --> 01:00:38,441
Well, I didn't want you
getting the wrong idea,

549
01:00:38,476 --> 01:00:40,944
My sharin' dinner
with some fuckin' cop.

550
01:00:42,946 --> 01:00:44,913
We didn't get
the wrong idea, Lester.

551
01:00:44,948 --> 01:00:48,068
We got the right idea.
Yeah.

552
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:52,537
Wanna go out?

553
01:00:52,572 --> 01:00:54,574
A job?
Right now.

554
01:00:55,075 --> 01:00:59,329
Okay, no, I
- Don't say no. It's your chance to prove yourself.

555
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,583
Come on, lester.
I know you're a good man.

556
01:01:04,050 --> 01:01:07,053
Catch up.
Come on, drink up, drink up.

557
01:01:09,556 --> 01:01:14,060
That's more like it.
We're drunk as skunks,

558
01:01:14,095 --> 01:01:16,563
And we want you to feel
just as good.

559
01:01:19,065 --> 01:01:22,569
That's more like it.
Ah!

560
01:01:22,604 --> 01:01:25,036
I have somethin'.

561
01:01:25,071 --> 01:01:28,074
You gettin' high? Drink it,
it's for you. I don't know.

562
01:01:28,109 --> 01:01:30,076
Eat this.
Eat this.

563
01:01:32,579 --> 01:01:38,084
What is it? It's, uh,
somethin' to eat. Eat it.

564
01:01:40,587 --> 01:01:45,006
What you been tellin'
the cops, lester? Nothin'!

565
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:48,044
What you talkin' to mosker
about? The weather, the phillies?

566
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:51,980
No. No, just, uh-

567
01:01:52,015 --> 01:01:55,518
I know you've been talkin'
about somethin'.

568
01:01:58,021 --> 01:02:01,489
I'm scared.
What?

569
01:02:01,524 --> 01:02:05,994
You can't be scared.
You're a tough guy.

570
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:09,032
You used to be a member
of the Whitewood gang.

571
01:02:09,532 --> 01:02:13,036
Yeah, I know, but-

572
01:02:15,038 --> 01:02:18,041
What'd you say?
Speak up.

573
01:02:22,045 --> 01:02:25,548
Well, I, uh, I sold him some
information. Leave him alone.

574
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:29,052
Uh-huh. Yeah, but it wasn't
true. It was about soleski.

575
01:02:29,087 --> 01:02:32,555
Oh? Oh, I hate him. Yeah, I know.

576
01:02:33,056 --> 01:02:34,557
I- I-I wouldn't hurt you, Brad.
You know that. He's a fat pig.

577
01:02:35,058 --> 01:02:37,025
I wanna help you, I do.
Yeah?

578
01:02:37,060 --> 01:02:39,562
I was pumpin' him for information,
stuff you guys can use.

579
01:02:39,597 --> 01:02:42,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, hurry up.

580
01:02:42,565 --> 01:02:46,069
I found out that, uh,
they brought the F.B.I. In.

581
01:02:46,104 --> 01:02:49,037
Yeah? No shit? Yeah.

582
01:02:49,072 --> 01:02:54,577
Yeah, and, uh, they got
this, uh, grand jury convened.

583
01:02:54,612 --> 01:02:56,544
About us?
Sure.

584
01:02:56,579 --> 01:03:00,583
Mm. I'm telling you, who would
tell you this kind of stuff...

585
01:03:00,618 --> 01:03:02,550
If it wasn't for me?

586
01:03:02,585 --> 01:03:05,553
I don't know. Guess you're
just a real good friend.

587
01:03:05,588 --> 01:03:10,558
I don't feel too good.
I drank too much.

588
01:03:10,593 --> 01:03:15,048
Better pull over.
Pull over by this tree.

589
01:03:39,155 --> 01:03:42,158
We're goin' down
to the river.

590
01:03:46,162 --> 01:03:49,666
I'm glad
to be able to-

591
01:03:49,701 --> 01:03:52,133
Ahh.

592
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:54,170
I can't walk.

593
01:03:57,674 --> 01:03:59,926
Hey! Hey!

594
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:02,178
Whoa.

595
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,683
Feel that water, les? It's good. Yeah.

596
01:04:06,718 --> 01:04:09,185
Wake you right up.
Whoo!

597
01:04:11,187 --> 01:04:12,689
It's getting deeper.

598
01:04:22,699 --> 01:04:27,203
Get your face wet. Water on
your face really wakes you up.

599
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:29,706
Hey, I don't need your help.
No, I can do it alone!

600
01:04:30,206 --> 01:04:32,208
Hey! Whoa!

601
01:04:32,709 --> 01:04:34,711
Ahh, Brad!

602
01:04:59,402 --> 01:05:02,405
Shh.

603
01:05:09,412 --> 01:05:13,299
We get this thing fixed up,
you'll be one cool dude,

604
01:05:13,334 --> 01:05:15,301
A real rumbler.

605
01:05:22,308 --> 01:05:25,777
I think I'm gonna
get myself a job...

606
01:05:25,812 --> 01:05:29,499
Fixing Chevys or something.
How much you make?

607
01:05:29,534 --> 01:05:33,186
You can get like ten,
twelve an hour. It depends.

608
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:37,690
That ain't that much.

609
01:05:38,191 --> 01:05:42,695
Hey, it's a steady job.
Nobody gets killed.

610
01:05:46,699 --> 01:05:48,701
Somebody got killed?

611
01:05:51,704 --> 01:05:54,707
Brad, when you went out with dad
and them, did somebody get killed?

612
01:05:54,742 --> 01:05:56,709
Forget it.

613
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:00,213
Brad. I said forget it, Tommy.

614
01:06:13,476 --> 01:06:15,478
He's no good.
What?

615
01:06:15,513 --> 01:06:17,445
They're no good.

616
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:20,116
What are you talking about?
They're bad people.

617
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:26,623
Hi, boys!
Hi, dad.

618
01:06:38,635 --> 01:06:40,637
What you think of that? That's nice.

619
01:06:41,137 --> 01:06:43,104
I just got it.

620
01:06:43,139 --> 01:06:45,642
You see, the thing is-

01:06:49,646 --> 01:06:53,650
And I was wondering if you guys

623
01:06:53,685 --> 01:06:55,652
Wacky-Tobaccy.

624
01:06:57,654 --> 01:07:00,657
What you say?

625
01:07:00,692 --> 01:07:02,659
Yeah.
Hurry up.

626
01:07:09,165 --> 01:07:11,167
Goin' out tonight.

627
01:07:13,169 --> 01:07:15,171
Be by around midnight.

628
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:27,183
What's the damage? Twenty-five? Forty.

629
01:07:27,218 --> 01:07:29,453
Yeah?
Forty.

630
01:07:29,488 --> 01:07:31,688
You a born thief.

631
01:07:42,699 --> 01:07:45,201
You crazy.
You know, you crazy.

632
01:07:51,207 --> 01:07:54,210
Lookin' good,
Julie Whitewood!

633
01:07:54,245 --> 01:07:56,713
Tired old bag of shit.

634
01:07:59,716 --> 01:08:01,718
You like that car?
You wanna sit in that car?

635
01:08:01,753 --> 01:08:04,721
Is it all right?
Go on, sit in it.

636
01:08:05,221 --> 01:08:07,223
All right.

637
01:08:11,728 --> 01:08:14,731
I'm not goin' out tonight.

638
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,735
What?
I'm not gonna go out anymore.

639
01:08:25,608 --> 01:08:29,111
You wanna live
in a dump like this?

640
01:08:29,146 --> 01:08:32,580
Workin' ten hours a day
in a cannery?

641
01:08:32,615 --> 01:08:37,620
I thought you were like me.
I thought you wanted something.

642
01:08:37,655 --> 01:08:40,555
A car,

643
01:08:40,590 --> 01:08:44,093
Nice girl sittin' in your lap,
money in your pocket.

644
01:08:44,594 --> 01:08:46,596
You said I could go out
and then decide, right?

645
01:08:47,096 --> 01:08:49,564
You scared?

646
01:08:49,599 --> 01:08:52,602
I got somethin' else.
Somethin' or somebody?

647
01:08:53,102 --> 01:08:57,572
Yeah, Terry and I
are gettin' outta here.

648
01:08:57,607 --> 01:09:00,109
Where you gonna go? What are you
gonna do when you get where you go?

649
01:09:00,144 --> 01:09:02,478
I got some ideas.

650
01:09:05,982 --> 01:09:08,950
How you gonna pay?

651
01:09:08,985 --> 01:09:11,487
Apartment, food, clothes.

652
01:09:11,988 --> 01:09:13,990
All that.
I'll find something.

653
01:09:15,992 --> 01:09:20,246
You'll find shit! All
you know is how to steal.

654
01:09:20,281 --> 01:09:24,500
You're too fuckin' dumb
to do that by yourself.

655
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:28,004
Oh, you think so?
I know so.

656
01:09:28,504 --> 01:09:32,008
You'll come back, crawlin' back to
me, "daddy, daddy, give me somethin'."

657
01:09:32,043 --> 01:09:34,761
Well, we'll see. We'll
see. Yeah, we'll see, yep.

658
01:09:57,750 --> 01:09:59,836
What's the matter?

659
01:10:05,374 --> 01:10:09,378
Tell me about your uncle.

660
01:10:09,879 --> 01:10:14,383
Your uncle. Will he
really take us?

661
01:10:14,884 --> 01:10:16,385
Sure.

662
01:10:19,388 --> 01:10:22,441
What's it like there?
What does it look like?

663
01:10:29,448 --> 01:10:32,451
It's called
the Big Sky country,

664
01:10:32,486 --> 01:10:35,454
'Cause the land goes on forever,

665
01:10:35,955 --> 01:10:39,959
Lookin' out 20 miles one way,
50 in the other.

666
01:10:42,261 --> 01:10:44,328
And they got jobs there too.

667
01:10:44,363 --> 01:10:48,334
My cousin's husband, Rollie,
he's got a job in Billings,

668
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:52,338
And he's about as dumb
as a dog or something.

669
01:10:54,841 --> 01:10:57,343
You know what else they got?

670
01:10:57,844 --> 01:11:01,397
My cousin
- She's just two years older than me, and she's got a baby.

671
01:11:05,017 --> 01:11:08,521
It's got little tiny feet
and little hands,

672
01:11:09,021 --> 01:11:11,023
And it laughs already.

673
01:11:11,524 --> 01:11:14,544
It probably talks now, but when
i was there, it was just laughing.

674
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:16,345
It was so tiny.

675
01:11:22,785 --> 01:11:24,787
I guess I love you, huh?

676
01:11:44,106 --> 01:11:46,609
So,

677
01:11:47,109 --> 01:11:49,111
What do you think?

678
01:11:50,112 --> 01:11:55,101
I don't know.
It- it seems-

679
01:11:55,136 --> 01:11:57,119
It's a little big.

680
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,588
Who cares if it's
a fucked-up idea?

681
01:12:00,623 --> 01:12:04,126
If we get away with it, we score big,
right? Look, it's not a fucked-up idea.

682
01:12:04,161 --> 01:12:08,130
All we have to do is get in and
out of there as fast as possible.

683
01:12:12,134 --> 01:12:14,136
Okay?

684
01:12:16,138 --> 01:12:18,391
Okay.

685
01:12:41,414 --> 01:12:44,382
Ahh!

686
01:12:44,417 --> 01:12:47,385
Ah, come on, there's a car!

687
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:49,887
Oh, shit. Somebody's
coming. Come on, let's go.

688
01:12:49,922 --> 01:12:52,925
Tommy, come on, help tim get
these ramps. Get the crowbar.

689
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:55,428
Where the fuck is it?
Aggie! Come on!

690
01:12:55,678 --> 01:12:59,181
- Get a load of this, man.
- Come on, the car!

691
01:12:59,216 --> 01:13:01,183
I gotta have her!
Let's go!

692
01:13:06,305 --> 01:13:08,808
Come on!
Isn't she beautiful?

693
01:13:10,309 --> 01:13:13,813
Let go, man! Get in!
Close the door and shut it!

694
01:13:20,319 --> 01:13:22,321
Fuck it! Come on!

695
01:13:41,841 --> 01:13:44,844
Now I want you to climb down
from there very slowly. Fuck!

696
01:14:15,758 --> 01:14:18,225
Okay, bailed out:

697
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:24,183
Essex, Milton,
Smithson and Whitewood, t.

698
01:14:28,187 --> 01:14:30,189
Go on.

699
01:15:23,275 --> 01:15:26,243
You here to shut this down?

700
01:15:26,278 --> 01:15:29,281
Maybe next week. What
do you want, Whitewood?

701
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,801
I put 500 on that gray one.

702
01:15:31,836 --> 01:15:34,286
Ho, ho,
that's a shrewd bet.

703
01:15:36,789 --> 01:15:39,757
What's my son sayin'?
Nothin'.

704
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:43,796
Yeah? But they haven't
really started on him yet.

705
01:15:45,297 --> 01:15:48,801
What about the F.B.I.?
They really bring 'em in?

706
01:15:48,836 --> 01:15:50,768
Mm-hmm, last month.

707
01:15:50,803 --> 01:15:53,305
Grand jury?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

708
01:15:54,807 --> 01:15:57,810
What they got?
Not much so far.

709
01:15:57,845 --> 01:16:00,813
I'm sure they'll
find something.

710
01:16:01,313 --> 01:16:02,815
Maybe a body
or two, hmm?

711
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:11,323
Can I make a donation?
A political somethin'?

712
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:15,344
No, not now.
It's too hot.

713
01:16:15,379 --> 01:16:19,331
Oh, your bird lost.
So he did.

714
01:16:27,223 --> 01:16:29,725
Maybe next week, hmm? If
they don't get anything more.

715
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,495
Yeah?
Yeah, we'll see.

716
01:16:32,530 --> 01:16:35,231
If they do... get more?

717
01:16:58,837 --> 01:17:02,091
Hi, is Mr. Whitewood here?
M- My name's Terry.

718
01:17:04,043 --> 01:17:06,045
It's okay.

719
01:17:12,551 --> 01:17:14,553
Thanks.

720
01:17:20,309 --> 01:17:24,778
Um, I was planning
to go see Brad,

721
01:17:24,813 --> 01:17:29,318
And, uh, his mother can't go till
the weekend 'cause she's working.

722
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,821
So I was wondering
if-if you're planning to go.

723
01:17:37,826 --> 01:17:40,329
Maybe.

724
01:17:40,829 --> 01:17:43,332
Well, if you do go,

725
01:17:43,832 --> 01:17:47,836
Um, do you mind
if I go with you?

726
01:17:47,871 --> 01:17:49,838
I don't see why not.

727
01:17:50,339 --> 01:17:54,343
You've done a lot for my boy. I hope so.

728
01:17:57,346 --> 01:18:00,349
You changed him.
Thank you.

729
01:18:02,851 --> 01:18:06,855
What I don't get is why
they let everybody else out,

730
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:09,358
And they set
Brad's bail so high.

731
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,827
I don't get it.

732
01:18:13,862 --> 01:18:17,866
They figure,
if he's in there long enough,

733
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:21,870
We'll know what he's saying. About what?

734
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:28,877
Oh.

735
01:18:33,465 --> 01:18:37,469
Mm.

736
01:18:39,605 --> 01:18:42,057
You want some corn flakes?

737
01:18:43,559 --> 01:18:45,561
No, thanks.

738
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:53,202
You scared, kid?
Of what?

739
01:18:53,702 --> 01:18:56,170
A bunch of tractor thieves?

740
01:18:56,205 --> 01:19:00,209
What do you owe those guys?
What'd they ever do for you?

741
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:02,711
What'd your father
ever do for you?

742
01:19:04,213 --> 01:19:07,216
I don't talk
against my family.

743
01:19:13,255 --> 01:19:15,257
Hello?

744
01:19:33,525 --> 01:19:39,031
Uh, look, uh,
do me a favor.

745
01:19:39,066 --> 01:19:43,000
That's 12,000 cash.

746
01:19:43,035 --> 01:19:46,038
Tell Brad that-
He don't want it.

747
01:19:47,673 --> 01:19:49,640
Let him decide.

748
01:19:49,675 --> 01:19:51,710
I said he don't want it.

749
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,383
- Wow, that's a really nice cake.
- Has it got a file in it?

750
01:19:57,883 --> 01:20:00,386
Yeah.

751
01:20:02,388 --> 01:20:05,356
I didn't-
I didn't even know you-

752
01:20:05,391 --> 01:20:07,393
I didn't know you guys
knew each other really.

753
01:20:07,893 --> 01:20:11,397
Lucas?
Oh, yeah.

754
01:20:11,897 --> 01:20:15,401
Only one in the whole kiddie gang
knows his ass from a pitchfork.

755
01:20:15,436 --> 01:20:17,903
I'm kinda takin' him
under my wing.

756
01:20:19,405 --> 01:20:21,407
Yeah.

757
01:20:24,410 --> 01:20:27,413
How you doin'?
Nervous, I bet.

758
01:20:28,914 --> 01:20:32,418
I'm okay. Ever been
inside a jail before?

759
01:20:32,668 --> 01:20:34,635
No. No way.

760
01:20:34,670 --> 01:20:37,172
It's nasty, I'll tell ya. It
gives me the Jimmies every time.

761
01:20:37,673 --> 01:20:40,175
Oh, yeah.

762
01:20:43,679 --> 01:20:47,147
Want some? What is it? Bourbon?

763
01:20:47,182 --> 01:20:50,185
It's just Rye. You're
welcome to it, if you want.

764
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,688
Oh, yeah. I heard that. It's good stuff.

765
01:20:53,188 --> 01:20:55,190
That'll really- It's
not a bad idea, really-

766
01:20:55,691 --> 01:20:59,695
Get a little juiced before you get
in there. Get some system goin'.

767
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:07,202
See, the thing is, it's
gonna be worst of all on you.

768
01:21:07,237 --> 01:21:10,170
Why's that?

769
01:21:10,205 --> 01:21:13,959
Bein' a girl.
Bein'- Bein' a cute girl.

770
01:21:13,994 --> 01:21:17,678
Yeah, bein' real cute
and bein' a girl.

771
01:21:17,713 --> 01:21:22,718
All them other convicts and the perverts
and such, be givin' you a real long look.

772
01:21:22,753 --> 01:21:26,722
Oh, they be lookin' at
you all over. That's right.

773
01:21:28,223 --> 01:21:30,691
Convicts stare.

774
01:21:30,726 --> 01:21:32,728
Aren't you gonna protect me?
Can't.

775
01:21:32,763 --> 01:21:34,730
Sure.
Not from their eyes.

776
01:21:35,230 --> 01:21:36,732
Don't worry about it.

777
01:21:40,235 --> 01:21:43,238
Another sip of that,
you won't feel nothin'.

778
01:21:44,740 --> 01:21:46,742
Go on.

779
01:21:52,748 --> 01:21:55,751
Just go on.
That's good stuff, huh?

780
01:21:55,786 --> 01:21:58,253
Drink it.
Yeah.

781
01:22:14,269 --> 01:22:17,272
I am okay. Come on. Just leave it there.

782
01:22:19,274 --> 01:22:22,242
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

783
01:22:22,277 --> 01:22:26,281
Come on. Come on. What? You touched me.

784
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,283
Okay.

785
01:22:30,786 --> 01:22:33,253
Come on.

786
01:22:33,288 --> 01:22:36,256
I wanna go-

787
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:38,293
I wanna go see Brad.
I don't wanna go in there.

788
01:22:38,328 --> 01:22:40,796
Screw Brad.

789
01:22:40,831 --> 01:22:42,798
No.

790
01:22:47,803 --> 01:22:50,771
What are you doing?
Where's lucas?

791
01:22:50,806 --> 01:22:55,811
Made a mistake. To let a woman rule his business
- That is a mistake.

792
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:58,063
What do you mean?

793
01:22:58,564 --> 01:23:01,532
Where the fuck-

794
01:23:01,567 --> 01:23:07,037
I wanna get out of this fucking
place. You scared yet? Hmm?

795
01:23:07,072 --> 01:23:09,575
Here, drink that down. You got
that pill? What is this place?

796
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:12,578
Where is it? Where is it?
Let me see it. Right.

797
01:23:12,613 --> 01:23:15,080
Drink it down.
You scared yet?

798
01:23:15,115 --> 01:23:16,547
Mm.

799
01:23:16,582 --> 01:23:19,550
You oughta be.
I'm not scared of you.

800
01:23:19,585 --> 01:23:24,054
You scared yet? No? Look, we
gotta get something straight now.

801
01:23:24,089 --> 01:23:27,593
Oh, no, you're not goin' anywhere.
We gotta get somethin' straight.

802
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:30,596
You ain't gonna see my son.

803
01:23:31,096 --> 01:23:34,565
Okay?
You give me your word.

804
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:37,603
I gotta hear it.
I gotta believe it.

805
01:23:39,104 --> 01:23:41,572
I love Brad.
Well, that's your mistake.

806
01:23:41,607 --> 01:23:45,576
I love him! That's a
mistake. It's over. That's it.

807
01:23:45,611 --> 01:23:49,364
You know too much, you think too
much, you talk too much. That's it.

808
01:23:49,399 --> 01:23:53,010
Okay? Where you goin'? Where you
goin'? Where the fuck you goin'?

809
01:23:53,045 --> 01:23:56,622
Come here. Let me tell you
something. Let me tell you something.

810
01:23:59,374 --> 01:24:02,260
- The answer's no.
- I ain't askin'.

811
01:24:08,266 --> 01:24:10,268
The answer is no.

812
01:24:12,771 --> 01:24:16,024
By the time I'm through with
you, you won't wanna see him.

813
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:19,242
He won't wanna touch you. Do
you understand? Get off me!

814
01:24:19,277 --> 01:24:22,781
You understand? He won't wanna
fuckin' touch you. Get off me!

815
01:24:22,898 --> 01:24:24,900
You understand now?

816
01:25:32,434 --> 01:25:36,054
- Well?
- Sit down.

817
01:25:36,438 --> 01:25:41,443
Ma'am? Ma'am!

818
01:25:44,696 --> 01:25:48,200
Yes? Is there a Thomas Whitewood here?

819
01:25:50,569 --> 01:25:53,205
Are you Thomas Whitewood?

820
01:25:54,706 --> 01:25:57,709
What about it?
I need you to sign this.

821
01:26:03,215 --> 01:26:05,717
Please, just sign it.

822
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,722
What is this?

823
01:26:14,226 --> 01:26:16,228
Uh-
Thank you.

824
01:26:24,236 --> 01:26:27,239
Somebody gave your name
to the grand jury.

825
01:26:27,274 --> 01:26:29,741
All right, you motherfucker!

826
01:26:42,621 --> 01:26:45,589
Motherfucker!

827
01:26:45,624 --> 01:26:48,627
Scum!
Motherfucker!

828
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:37,893
Hell, man, don't worry
about no subpoena.

829
01:27:37,928 --> 01:27:40,360
They got nothing on you.

830
01:27:40,395 --> 01:27:44,865
Yeah. Gee, I sure hope not.

831
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:49,369
They're just fishin'
for somethin' or other.

832
01:27:49,404 --> 01:27:53,909
Now, where the hell
is this tractor, anyhow?

833
01:27:53,944 --> 01:27:55,911
Patch?
Up a ways.

834
01:27:56,278 --> 01:27:58,745
This is one hell of a...

835
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:03,785
Jesus H. Christ kind of a place
to go find some tractor.

836
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:07,289
We only found it,
'cause last year, Dickie,

837
01:28:07,789 --> 01:28:09,791
He poached for deer
up in these woods.

838
01:28:10,292 --> 01:28:14,296
A white deer.
Right over in there.

839
01:28:21,219 --> 01:28:22,721
Now what's that?

840
01:28:27,475 --> 01:28:30,478
Damn, I thought he was gonna
back right into his grave.

841
01:29:00,008 --> 01:29:03,511
You know, aggie, I like
that ring you got.

842
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:06,980
What'd it cost?
Beats me.

843
01:29:07,015 --> 01:29:12,020
Is that a real sapphire?
Wouldn't you like to know?

844
01:29:14,522 --> 01:29:16,524
Yeah, I would.

845
01:29:21,029 --> 01:29:23,031
Is that a real gun?

846
01:29:51,142 --> 01:29:53,645
Come on, right over here!
Get your tickets right here!

847
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,648
Get your tickets here!
Hubba, hubba, hubba!

848
01:30:00,652 --> 01:30:03,655
Come on, give me
one of those tickets!

849
01:30:23,258 --> 01:30:25,260
Ever been out west, Tommy?

850
01:30:25,295 --> 01:30:27,761
No.

851
01:30:27,796 --> 01:30:32,766
Ever heard a coyote?
No.

852
01:30:32,801 --> 01:30:35,854
They make this sound like,
whoo, whoo, whoo.

853
01:30:37,906 --> 01:30:40,825
Coyote bitch gets in heat,

854
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:43,293
First thing she does,

855
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,814
She'd take care
of the males.

856
01:30:46,815 --> 01:30:50,300
Then she head toward town.

857
01:30:50,335 --> 01:30:53,321
All the neighborhood dogs,
they smell her.

858
01:30:53,356 --> 01:30:57,842
They go crazy.
They follow her.

859
01:31:00,545 --> 01:31:03,715
She lures them
out onto the desert.

860
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,950
She get the dog
out there...

861
01:31:06,968 --> 01:31:09,436
Alone.

862
01:31:09,471 --> 01:31:11,973
All the other coyote
come along.

863
01:31:12,008 --> 01:31:14,441
They circle round.

864
01:31:14,476 --> 01:31:17,529
They kill that dog.
Eat it.

865
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:22,165
Tommy,

866
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:27,705
If you was to go up in front of
that grand jury, what would you say?

867
01:31:27,740 --> 01:31:29,808
Nothin'.

868
01:31:32,377 --> 01:31:35,380
- Dad.
- Liar!

869
01:32:23,211 --> 01:32:27,215
That's our deal. You let me outta here
right now, or I don't say one more word.

870
01:32:27,348 --> 01:32:31,818
Can't do it. Your father's
hiding three kids already.

871
01:32:31,853 --> 01:32:35,356
Besides, the only thing you've talked
about so far are tractor thefts.

872
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:37,358
Why should we think you have
anything else to tell us?

873
01:32:39,277 --> 01:32:41,529
Have you guys ever heard
of lester peralsky?

874
01:32:48,653 --> 01:32:52,157
Ma, Terry and I are leaving'.
We're gettin' outta here.

875
01:32:52,192 --> 01:32:55,160
You'd be goin' where?

876
01:32:55,660 --> 01:32:57,662
I got relatives in-
Far away.

877
01:32:59,164 --> 01:33:01,549
Do you have any money
we can borrow?

878
01:33:03,051 --> 01:33:05,053
Not really.

879
01:33:05,553 --> 01:33:08,556
Well, I-I have a little bit.

880
01:33:08,591 --> 01:33:11,024
Great.

881
01:33:11,059 --> 01:33:16,564
Say, Brad junior, have you
heard anything from Tommy? No.

882
01:33:17,565 --> 01:33:20,568
I don't even wanna
think about Tommy.

883
01:33:22,070 --> 01:33:24,037
What is that
supposed to mean?

884
01:33:24,072 --> 01:33:28,076
Just itself.
Don't think about him.

885
01:33:46,794 --> 01:33:49,879
How about this?

886
01:33:49,914 --> 01:33:52,425
Let's tie him to a tree...

887
01:33:52,460 --> 01:33:54,936
In the back of the woods...

888
01:33:55,403 --> 01:33:57,804
And just stare at him
for a while.

889
01:33:57,839 --> 01:34:02,143
No!
But can't you just see it?

890
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:06,412
He's tied to a tree...
naked.

891
01:34:06,447 --> 01:34:10,451
And we could give him
like a lollipop or somethin'...

892
01:34:10,952 --> 01:34:14,439
Or a can of Budweiser.
Shut up!

893
01:34:16,908 --> 01:34:20,411
Suppose that little girl
is with him?

894
01:34:20,446 --> 01:34:22,914
Then bye-bye girl.

895
01:34:23,881 --> 01:34:28,336
That's too bad.
She was real cute.

896
01:34:30,755 --> 01:34:35,260
Might be better, uh,
if it was at night.

897
01:34:37,762 --> 01:34:39,764
Right?

898
01:34:45,270 --> 01:34:47,772
I don't want no part of this. Boyd?

899
01:34:50,275 --> 01:34:53,278
You got the soul
of a pig,

900
01:34:54,746 --> 01:34:56,748
A stuck pig.

901
01:34:58,232 --> 01:35:01,235
Sooey.
Sooey, sooey.

902
01:35:05,206 --> 01:35:07,208
I don't care.

903
01:35:08,710 --> 01:35:11,713
I'm not touchin' this one.

904
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,715
Okay.

905
01:35:23,858 --> 01:35:25,860
Well?

906
01:35:49,467 --> 01:35:52,587
You can hang it up where you're
going to. I mean, if you want to.

907
01:35:53,054 --> 01:35:55,006
Thanks.

908
01:36:06,768 --> 01:36:09,270
Gotta go.
Brad!

909
01:36:12,273 --> 01:36:14,776
It's something
over 400.

910
01:36:14,811 --> 01:36:16,778
Thanks a lot.

911
01:36:17,278 --> 01:36:19,781
I guess
it's a rainy day.

912
01:36:19,816 --> 01:36:21,783
Thanks, grandma.

913
01:36:29,290 --> 01:36:31,292
Take care of Terry now.
I will.

914
01:36:33,795 --> 01:36:35,797
Good-bye.
Bye.

915
01:37:32,687 --> 01:37:35,690
How's it coming?
It's almost there.

916
01:37:37,191 --> 01:37:40,159
It could wait till morning.

917
01:37:40,194 --> 01:37:42,822
No. Your mother'll
be back in the morning.

918
01:37:42,857 --> 01:37:46,906
Farther we are away,
it'll be a lot better.

919
01:37:46,941 --> 01:37:50,955
You don't have to say
what I wanna do

920
01:38:07,238 --> 01:38:11,240
Come on, come on, come on
and have a Pepsi day

921
01:38:11,275 --> 01:38:15,244
It's the laughter of a world
at play memories of a Pepsi day

922
01:38:15,279 --> 01:38:19,283
Come on, come on and have a Pepsi day
join the Pepsi generation

923
01:38:19,318 --> 01:38:24,789
Have a pepsi day

924
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:09,083
Oh, I forgot
to feed the dog.

925
01:39:11,452 --> 01:39:12,453
Oh, no!

926
01:41:25,419 --> 01:41:27,922
Hey, dad.

927
01:41:34,578 --> 01:41:37,096
Let ya outta the stir?

928
01:41:37,131 --> 01:41:40,616
Yeah, I-I just told them
a pack of lies...

929
01:41:40,651 --> 01:41:43,604
And now I'm just runnin'
where they can't find me.

930
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:46,590
That's good.

931
01:41:47,108 --> 01:41:49,110
Where nobody can find me.

932
01:41:49,145 --> 01:41:52,113
Good.

933
01:41:53,614 --> 01:41:55,616
You got a beer?

934
01:41:57,618 --> 01:42:00,121
Yeah, sure.

935
01:42:10,297 --> 01:42:12,299
Gotta take a leak.

936
01:42:55,226 --> 01:42:58,763
Dad.

937
01:43:05,770 --> 01:43:08,272
It's good to see you.
Really.

938
01:43:12,777 --> 01:43:15,471
You look pale.

939
01:43:15,506 --> 01:43:18,165
I am pale.

940
01:43:21,669 --> 01:43:23,921
Where you been tonight?

941
01:43:26,423 --> 01:43:29,927
Got drunk, had a fight. Mary
Sue, you know, kicked her out.

942
01:43:29,962 --> 01:43:33,931
You know, went to andy's.
Same old thing, you know?

943
01:43:34,298 --> 01:43:38,886
Yeah, I know.
Know where I been?

944
01:43:47,862 --> 01:43:50,815
That's nothin'. I just cut
myself on some barbed wire.

945
01:43:52,316 --> 01:43:55,820
Don't move. I said,
don't fuckin' move!

946
01:43:55,953 --> 01:43:58,455
Just goin' to get some-
- I said, don't fuckin' move.

947
01:44:00,324 --> 01:44:03,327
Is this the gun you used?

948
01:44:03,828 --> 01:44:06,330
That's a nice-looking gun.

949
01:44:10,334 --> 01:44:12,837
Is this the gun you used to kill
Tommy? Tommy's dead, isn't he?

950
01:44:13,087 --> 01:44:14,588
Don't talk to me about Tommy.

951
01:44:15,089 --> 01:44:18,592
Is this the gun you used
to kill Terry?

952
01:44:18,627 --> 01:44:20,978
I never did nothin'
to Terry.

953
01:44:21,478 --> 01:44:24,982
Whoa! Whoa, wait, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait!

954
01:44:25,017 --> 01:44:29,486
Is this the gun you used
on everybody? On me?

955
01:44:31,438 --> 01:44:33,440
Is this a family gun, dad?

956
01:44:33,941 --> 01:44:38,946
Jesus. Put that down.
What's eatin' you?

957
01:44:39,446 --> 01:44:42,833
- You're gonna die.
- Come on-

958
01:44:43,200 --> 01:44:45,703
I know one thing clearer than I've
ever known anything in my entire life,

959
01:44:46,203 --> 01:44:50,207
Except that I loved Terry
before you killed her,

960
01:44:50,242 --> 01:44:52,209
And that is that
you're gonna die.

961
01:44:52,593 --> 01:44:55,596
You got the guts...

962
01:44:55,631 --> 01:44:58,599
To kill... me?

963
01:44:59,099 --> 01:45:01,602
I'm your blood!
I'm your family!

964
01:45:01,719 --> 01:45:03,220
You're not my family.
Not anymore.

965
01:45:03,721 --> 01:45:06,724
Yeah, you're crazy.
Crazy! Gone crazy.

966
01:45:06,759 --> 01:45:09,744
Nope. Listen! Listen!

967
01:45:09,779 --> 01:45:12,695
What?
I know how it is.

968
01:45:12,730 --> 01:45:16,734
Cops got ya in there, get your head
all fucked-up. I know how that is.

969
01:45:16,769 --> 01:45:19,236
My mind's simple, dad.

970
01:45:20,237 --> 01:45:22,705
Before they got you twisted,

971
01:45:22,740 --> 01:45:25,207
You must've known somethin',
you must've felt it.

972
01:45:25,242 --> 01:45:30,247
I gave you money, I gave you a car, I
took you in. Don't that mean somethin'?

973
01:45:30,282 --> 01:45:34,251
Means what?
Means what?

974
01:45:36,503 --> 01:45:40,474
It means, I got feelin' for
ya. What fuckin' feeling?

975
01:45:40,509 --> 01:45:44,944
I care. What do ya-
I love you.

976
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:47,481
What?
Is that what you wanna hear?

977
01:45:47,516 --> 01:45:49,984
I love you.
Yeah?

978
01:45:51,735 --> 01:45:53,604
Motherfucker!

979
01:45:57,608 --> 01:45:59,860
I love you too, dad.

980
01:46:03,364 --> 01:46:06,367
Whoa!
Don't!

981
01:46:23,133 --> 01:46:25,135
No.

982
01:46:26,637 --> 01:46:29,139
No, I ain't you.

983
01:46:31,642 --> 01:46:34,144
Besides,
this is too easy.

984
01:46:36,146 --> 01:46:38,649
I want you to die slow.

985
01:46:39,149 --> 01:46:43,037
I want you to die every day
for the rest of your life.

986
01:47:05,809 --> 01:47:07,311
Go on.

987
01:47:43,297 --> 01:47:46,050
- Don't fuckin' move!
- I don't move.

988
01:49:24,865 --> 01:49:27,117
Your name?

989
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:30,537
Bradford Whitewood.

990
01:49:32,539 --> 01:49:34,541
And what
do they call you?

991
01:49:36,043 --> 01:49:39,046
Brad, little Brad,
Brad junior.

992
01:49:40,547 --> 01:49:44,551
And is there a Brad senior? A big Brad?

993
01:49:52,559 --> 01:49:55,562
- Yes.
- Who is he?

994
01:50:00,067 --> 01:50:03,070
My father.
What did you say?

995
01:50:36,053 --> 01:50:38,055
He's my father.

996
01:50:55,672 --> 01:50:57,956
I have

997
01:50:57,991 --> 01:51:02,496
A tale to tell

998
01:51:04,498 --> 01:51:07,501
Sometimes it gets so hard

999
01:51:07,536 --> 01:51:11,004
To hide it well

1000
01:51:14,508 --> 01:51:20,514
I was not ready for the fall

1001
01:51:22,015 --> 01:51:28,021
Too blind to see the writing
on the wall

1002
01:51:31,024 --> 01:51:34,527
A man can tell
a thousand lies

1003
01:51:34,562 --> 01:51:38,031
I've learned
my lesson well

1004
01:51:38,532 --> 01:51:43,537
Hope I live to tell the secret
i have learned

1005
01:51:43,572 --> 01:51:45,539
Till then

1006
01:51:46,039 --> 01:51:52,045
It will burn inside of me

1007
01:52:07,561 --> 01:52:09,563
I know

1008
01:52:10,063 --> 01:52:14,568
Where beauty lives

1009
01:52:16,570 --> 01:52:18,537
I've seen it once

1010
01:52:18,572 --> 01:52:23,076
I know the warm she gives

1011
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:32,085
The light that you
could never see

1012
01:52:34,087 --> 01:52:36,054
It shines inside

1013
01:52:36,089 --> 01:52:41,094
You can't take that
from me

1014
01:52:43,096 --> 01:52:46,599
A man can tell
a thousand lies

1015
01:52:46,634 --> 01:52:50,068
I've learned
my lesson well

1016
01:52:50,103 --> 01:52:55,609
Hope I live to tell the secret
i have learned

1017
01:52:55,644 --> 01:52:58,076
Till then

1018
01:52:58,111 --> 01:53:04,117
It will burn inside of me

1019
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:11,124
The truth is never
far behind

1020
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:14,092
You kept it hidden well

1021
01:53:14,127 --> 01:53:19,633
If I live to tell the secret
i knew then

1022
01:53:19,668 --> 01:53:21,635
Will I

1023
01:53:22,135 --> 01:53:27,140
Ever have the chance again

1024
01:53:43,156 --> 01:53:45,624
If I ran away

1025
01:53:45,659 --> 01:53:51,665
I'd never have the strength
to go very far

1026
01:53:51,700 --> 01:53:54,167
How would they hear

1027
01:53:54,668 --> 01:54:00,173
The beating of my heart

1028
01:54:00,674 --> 01:54:03,176
Will it grow cold
will it grow cold

1029
01:54:03,677 --> 01:54:07,180
The secret that I hide

1030
01:54:07,215 --> 01:54:09,147
Will I grow old

1031
01:54:09,182 --> 01:54:13,687
How will they hear
when will they learn

1032
01:54:13,722 --> 01:54:18,692
How will they know

1033
01:54:27,701 --> 01:54:31,204
A man can tell
a thousand lies

1034
01:54:31,239 --> 01:54:34,708
I've learned my lesson well

1035
01:54:35,208 --> 01:54:40,213
Hope I live to tell the secret
i have learned

1036
01:54:40,248 --> 01:54:42,215
Till then

1037
01:54:42,716 --> 01:54:48,221
It will burn inside of me

1038
01:54:51,725 --> 01:54:55,729
The truth is never
far behind

1039
01:54:55,764 --> 01:54:58,732
You kept it hidden well

1040
01:54:59,232 --> 01:55:04,237
If I live to tell the secret
i knew then

1041
01:55:04,272 --> 01:55:06,204
Will I

1042
01:55:06,239 --> 01:55:12,245
Ever have the chance again

1043
01:55:15,749 --> 01:55:19,252
A man can tell
a thousand lies

1044
01:55:19,753 --> 01:55:22,721
I've learned my lesson well

1045
01:55:22,756 --> 01:55:28,261
Hope I live to tell the secre
i have learned

1046
01:55:28,296 --> 01:55:30,212
Till then

1047
01:55:30,247 --> 01:55:36,186
It will burn inside of me

1048
01:55:37,000 --> 01:55:40,124
