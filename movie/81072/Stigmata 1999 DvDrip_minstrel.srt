1
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,600
BELO QUINTO, SOUTHEAST BRAZIL

2
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,800
- Are you the investigator?
- Yes.

3
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,200
Thank God you've come.

4
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,280
Who's in charge here?

5
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,240
Father Alameida was.

6
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,560
Look! How much proof do you need?!

7
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,040
Has the statue been removed
from the church for any reason?

8
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,040
No. The statue only started crying
on the day Father Alameida died.

9
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,160
The day the doves came back.

10
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,200
The people of the village loved Alameida.

11
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,760
The tears of the Mother
are the blood of Christ.

12
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,000
I suggest you clear the church.
I have to crate the statue up.

13
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,240
- Crate it up?
- Yes.

14
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,880
Father Alameida would
never have allowed that.

15
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,760
Ma'am? This is Father Alameida's
own rosary...

16
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,120
- No, lady, you really shouldn't buy that.
- No, I like it... How much?

17
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,680
You shouldn't do that!
You're stealing from the dead!

18
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,760
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee:

19
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,840
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the...

20
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,840
No virgin, me

21
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,520
For I have sinned

22
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,280
I sold my soul

23
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,680
For sex and gin

24
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,680
Go call a priest

25
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,240
All meek and mild

26
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,120
And tell him Mary

27
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,960
Is no more a child

28
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,080
It's raining stones

29
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,120
It's raining bile

30
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,000
From the luxury

31
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,960
Of your denial

32
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,840
I press alarms

33
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,120
Place bets on truth

34
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,360
I'm so up and down

35
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,600
And now I'm growing old

36
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,680
Disgracefully

37
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:49,480
Whatever happened to Mary?

38
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,320
Whatever happened to Mary?

39
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,240
Whatever happened to Mary?

40
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:01,240
Whatever happened to Mary?

41
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
Whatever happened to...

42
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,600
I'll spit on floors

43
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,480
And do more drugs

44
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,360
Burn every bill

45
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,560
Get drunk on love

46
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
Wear next to nothing...

47
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,800
Hey, Frankie, sweetheart!

48
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,000
Let's go. I'm trashed.

49
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,440
Are you too tired to go home with me?

50
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,240
I'm tired, not dead.

51
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,480
I'll be uncareful

52
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,000
I'll cause such scenes

53
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
And I'll never talk

54
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,840
Of used-to-be's

55
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,880
Tattoo my face

56
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,800
I won't go grey

57
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,720
Be a dancing queen

58
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,240
I'm growing old disgracefully

59
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,120
I'm so up and down

60
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,200
And I love what's not allowed

61
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,200
I was lost

62
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,280
Now I see

63
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:00,480
And now I'm growing old disgracefully

64
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,160
Oh, hi, Mom.

65
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,120
How do you do that?
How did you know that was me?

66
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,760
You have the most persistent ring I know.

67
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,320
I just wanted to say hi while
I'm near a phone. How are you?

68
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,680
Where are you?

69
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,880
Belo Quinto, near Rio.

70
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,320
Mom, hold on, I'm getting another call.

71
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,400
Hello?

72
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,120
It's about time. Where you been, baby?

73
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,960
I hate it when you just leave.
You could say goodbye.

74
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,040
Why?

75
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,400
"Why?" Forget it.

76
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:29,080
Look, I got my mom on the other line.
I'll see you tonight.

77
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,160
All right, I'll see you later.

78
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,360
Mom? Hi, I'm back.
So how do you like Rio?

79
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:38,320
- It was great. Did you get my package?
- Yeah, I got it yesterday.

80
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
- What did you think? Did you open it yet?
- Hold on, I'm gonna change phones.

81
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:52,240
What do you think? Did you get a chance
to look at everything?

82
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm opening it now.

83
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,280
- Pretty postcards.
- Aren't those pretty?

84
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,480
- Cute brush.
- I saw a lady make that.

85
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,280
- A little hat.
- It's probably for a little doll.

86
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,560
- A necklace?
- It’s not really a necklace. It’s a rosary.

87
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,160
- Where did you get it?
- This little village...

88
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,960
- Belo Quinto.
- I didn't know you went there.

89
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,280
I took a little side trip.
So, the presents, do you love 'em?

90
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,200
I’m so glad we talked.
I’m going on that cruise.

91
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,480
We won't talk for a month. I have to run.

92
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:22,040
Have fun. I love you.
I'm glad you called, Mom. Bye.

93
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,640
- Can I get two lattes, please? Low fat.
- Got it.

94
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,640
- Just one. I'm OK.
- A bacon and egg sandwich, too.

95
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,400
To go. What's up?
You're not eating today?

96
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,120
I threw up this morning
from the smell of tea.

97
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,520
Late?

98
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,520
- Like a week.
- A week?

99
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,240
I don't know. A few days. I feel weird.

100
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,600
You're so dramatic.

101
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,200
I think you're just psyching yourself out.

102
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,160
I feel like my heart
went to go live in my stomach.

103
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,560
OK, it's not traumatic!

104
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,800
- What if I'm having a baby?
- With Steven?

105
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,360
What if I'm bringing a person
into this world?

106
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,440
Man, what if? You've got options.

107
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,560
I don't want to think about it.
It's making me cranky.

108
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,680
Let's get our tired asses to work
cos we are late.

109
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,920
You're always late. There's nothing new.

110
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Ciao, bello!
Are you looking for a good time?

111
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,680
That is very kind of you,
but no, thank you.

112
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,160
Come on! Have some fun! Be a man!

113
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,960
No problem!

114
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,280
We'll give you the Vatican discount!

115
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,320
VATICAN CITY

116
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,240
- Father Andrew Kiernan, welcome back.
- Cardinal Houseman.

117
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,080
These are interesting. What's the trick?

118
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,520
To be honest, I don't know.

119
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,080
They probably made a fortune out of her.

120
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,680
What's... What was this?

121
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:43,120
Infrared photographs of tears.
The statue's at room temperature,

122
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,720
but the tears show up
as white because...

123
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,360
- Because they're warm.
- Warm tears?

124
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,880
Yes.

125
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,920
My lab report and analysis confirm that
the blood is not only warm, but... human.

126
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:03,360
I know what you're thinking,
but with all due respect, Daniel,

127
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,600
this isn't a fake. It's solid stone.
There is no scientific explanation.

128
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,560
Andrew, you were sent to Brazil

129
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:14,040
to investigate the appearance of
the Virgin Mary on the side of a building.

130
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,800
Yes, but in Sao Paulo I heard
about the statue, so I investigated.

131
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,680
- And?
- And what?

132
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,560
- The face of the Virgin Mary?
- It's an oxidation stain

133
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,080
caused by rainwater running down
untreated side walls.

134
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,600
Causes an optical illusion
of a veiled woman.

135
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:31,920
Good. We'll consider the matter closed.

136
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:34,640
Father Dario has your next assignment.

137
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,160
I was hoping that perhaps you could
send me back to Belo Quinto.

138
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,240
Why?

139
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,360
Because I need to do
some more tests on the statue.

140
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,920
You've left the statue in Belo Quinto?

141
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:49,680
Yes. I was going to take it back,

142
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,600
but when I saw the effect
it had on the people...

143
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,160
It's become a cornerstone of their faith.

144
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,080
Andrew, the cornerstone
of their faith is the Church,

145
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
not a crying statue.

146
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,600
You represent the Catholic Church

147
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,040
and the Congregation
of the Causes of the Saints.

148
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:11,800
Yes, I'm very well aware of that, Daniel,
but as a scientist I observe the facts.

149
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,040
And the facts are that this statue
has tears of blood.

150
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,040
If that's the case,
you know the policy.

151
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,920
The statue is brought back to the Vatican.
We conduct expert tests.

152
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,520
Geologist, engineers, medical examiners.

153
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:28,480
We've examined 50 or 60 crying statues
in the last 12 months.

154
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,480
Not a single one of them has...

155
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,800
Yes, I'm aware of that, but I wanted you
to know that in my opinion

156
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,160
I think that this is different.

157
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,560
I won't allow you to go back to Brazil.

158
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:44,040
We'll send a geologist, and if he sees fit
we'll send the statue back for tests.

159
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:48,320
Father Dario, get me all the information
you can on this church in Belo Quinto.

160
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,080
Thank you, Andrew.

161
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,320
Thank you.

162
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,120
I have never seen him this way before.

163
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:09,760
Andrew's problem is he can't decide
if he's a scientist or a priest.

164
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,880
Frankie,
you are gonna drive yourself crazy.

165
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,960
No.

166
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,440
If you're worried about being pregnant,
let's go to the store and get a test.

167
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,720
- Give it a couple of days.
- Are you sure?

168
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,000
- I'm fine. Stop mothering me!
- All right, girlfriend. I'll call you later.

169
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,520
OK, bye. Drive safe.

170
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,280
- Late?
- Like a week.

171
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,880
- You're always late. There's nothing new.
- What if I'm bringing a person

172
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,840
- into this world?
- Frankie, you've got options.

173
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,320
Nurse, what's going on?
I don't understand.

174
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,600
- Get out of the way!
- Frankie, can you hear me?

175
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm right here with you.

176
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,800
Let's go!

177
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,160
Why is there so much blood?

178
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,640
Get me a clamp right now.

179
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,680
All right, CBC, electrolytes,
UA, tox screen.

180
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,000
Get me a pulse box, stat!

181
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,120
- Get me a tox screen and a stat CT.
- Heart rate is irregular.

182
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,480
Blood pressure's off the map.
195 over 120.

183
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,040
- Let's change cuffs.
- Where's the IV?

184
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,120
I'm calling it. Code blue.
Get the paddles. Get some gel.

185
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,320
OK, ready?

186
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,680
- Get the paddles.
- All right, clear.

187
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,160
Temperature and blood pressure
are back to normal.

188
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,640
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr Reston.

189
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,480
- Do you know what your name is?
- What happened?

190
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,040
- Where am I?
- You're in the emergency room.

191
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,920
You were found unconscious.
Do you remember anything?

192
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,320
No.

193
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,280
Jesus!

194
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:11,600
Can I get some more help over here?
We need some four-by-fours.

195
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:16,080
We have a very deep laceration here.
Oh, my God, it's gone right through.

196
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,080
Miss, you can't go in there.

197
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,360
Doctor, I just need to know what's...

198
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,320
She'll be fine.
Please have a seat. Thank you.

199
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:28,280
These are puncture wounds
caused by the entry of a sharp object.

200
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,840
Are you in any pain?

201
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,200
No. That's weird, isn't it?

202
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,640
Wow, will you look at that!
It only bleeds when I touch it.

203
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,760
Maybe you should not touch it.

204
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,480
Both wounds are identical.
The same size, same shape.

205
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,280
She missed the main artery
by less then a centimeter.

206
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,440
You keep saying "she". I didn't do this.

207
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,600
What's happening in your life, Frankie?
Do you have a lot of stress at work?

208
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,640
I cut hair.

209
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,080
Any trouble with a significant other?

210
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,280
- Yes.
- And that is?

211
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,480
I'm not very significant.

212
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,200
Look, how long's this gonna take?
I wanna go home.

213
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:06,360
You should stay here.
We need to get a handle on this.

214
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,600
There's nothing to get a handle on.

215
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:13,080
I won't kid you. With wounds like this,
it's obvious they were self-inflicted.

216
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,240
You think I did this?

217
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,800
It would never happen.

218
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,480
I love being me. Ask anyone.

219
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,680
Frankie,

220
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,520
turn the light off, honey,
and come to bed.

221
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880
Do you smell flowers
in here or something?

222
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,160
No.

223
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,960
Smells like jasmine
or hyacinth or something.

224
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,840
I don't smell anything.

225
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,240
You need anything?

226
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,240
No.

227
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,080
Good night.

228
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,840
Good night.

229
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,320
- I'm here to see Brother Delmonico.
- You've got to sign in.

230
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,000
- I'll only be five minutes.
- Everyone has to sign in.

231
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,840
Duty-free.

232
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,680
- Welcome back, Andrew.
- Gianni, come stai?

233
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,640
God is good.

234
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,680
So how was Belo Quinto?

235
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,920
How do you know about Belo Quinto?
I was sent to Sao Paulo.

236
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,960
- God lives here. We know everything.
- Oh, yes, I forgot.

237
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,360
So how are you doing?

238
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,440
I don't know.

239
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,040
I don't know.

240
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,080
I travel round the world
investigating... miracles.

241
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,160
And then I disprove them.

242
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,480
The real miracle is
anybody believes anything.

243
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:17,280
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- None of us know what we are doing.

244
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,000
- So what are you working on?
- I have no idea.

245
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,080
How can you translate something
if you've no idea?

246
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,920
I'm a linguist.
I translate words, not their relevance.

247
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,800
- But this one is a second-century gospel.
- How many is that now?

248
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,680
I've helped translate about 15.

249
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,320
That only leaves 20 still to go.

250
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,840
So there are... what? 35 gospels?

251
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,840
Everyone had a different experience
of Jesus, so they wrote different stories.

252
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,080
All the gospels,
they are interpretations,

253
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,920
memories,

254
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,040
dreams, reflections.

255
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,720
And there's no one gospel
in Jesus' actual words?

256
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,640
We're all blind men in a cave,

257
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,040
looking for the candle
that was lit 2,000 years ago.

258
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
So what's in this text?

259
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,280
I was only given every third page.

260
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,360
- Why?
- The most sensitive documents

261
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,120
are always divided into threes among us.

262
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,360
One third to the Dominicans,
one third to the Franciscans,

263
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:16,560
and one third to us Jesuits.

264
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,640
The truth of any document
is only known to a very powerful few.

265
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:24,320
That's typical of this place, isn't it?

266
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:28,440
We live in a highly competitive world,
Andrew.

267
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,640
The Church is no exception.

268
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,040
Nothing ever gets out of here, does it?

269
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,760
Unless, of course, they want it to.

270
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,640
Both wounds are identical.
Same size, same shape.

271
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,360
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimeter.

272
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,360
You think I did this?

273
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,080
What's happening in your life, Frankie?

274
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,120
- So, Jen, tell us about your date.
- It was with a tax lawyer.

275
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,200
A tax lawyer?

276
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,640
When I met him he seemed cool.

277
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,480
Hey, hi, you guys.

278
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,960
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

279
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,160
Really OK, or just OK?

280
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,240
I'm fine. So how's my day looking?

281
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,040
I started your first client
and you're booked solid.

282
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,800
Thanks. Wanna come over here?

283
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,520
OK, well, go back to Jen and dish the dirt.

284
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,400
So,

285
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,480
he seemed pretty cool.

286
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,560
Divorced, but no kids.

287
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,480
But he left the table in the middle of
dinner to call his mother in Oregon.

288
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,680
Major points for the long-distance mom.

289
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,680
Yeah. You know,
I thought I'd give him a shot,

290
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,680
but you won't believe what he did.

291
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,800
Every single time he took
a bite of his steak,

292
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,280
he growled. He growled!

293
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,160
Shit!

294
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,600
Stop! There's a baby!

295
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:53,960
Stop!

296
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,360
Wait!

297
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,480
There's a baby!

298
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,880
Frankie, what are you doing!

299
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,440
Where's the baby?!

300
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,560
Watch it, lady!

301
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,760
- Frankie!
- Where's the lady! Did you see her!

302
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,520
She dropped her baby!

303
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,640
Frankie, there was no baby, honey.
There's no baby and there's no lady.

304
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:20,240
- What's happening?
- No, honey, it's...

305
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,040
There was a lady. I saw her!

306
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,800
- There was not a lady.
- She dropped her baby!

307
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,880
I swear... I swear!

308
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,840
I just wanna get you home, OK?

309
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,520
You all right?

310
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,760
We'll be home in a minute.

311
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,160
- Frankie...
- Hey, you!

312
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,160
- Are you speaking to me?
- Are you Andrew Kiernan?

313
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,160
Andrew Kiernan? No.
My name's Father Durning.

314
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,560
May I help you?

315
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,360
No-one can help me now. I'm fucked.

316
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,720
Passengers please exit the train.

317
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,440
Somebody help!

318
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,280
Frankie Paige?

319
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,800
We're gonna schedule some more tests

320
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,920
- for this afternoon around four.
- Did you run a pregnancy test?

321
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,760
Yes.

322
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,320
Am I pregnant?

323
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,840
No.

324
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,480
- Was I?
- I don't know.

325
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:29,560
Take this, all of you, and drink from it,
for this is the cup of my blood,

326
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:33,280
shed for you, and for all men,
so that sins may be forgiven.

327
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:36,000
Do this in memory of me.

328
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,760
This is the blood of Christ.

329
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
This is the blood of Christ.

330
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,920
This is the blood of Christ.

331
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,840
Well, am I psychotic, or dying, or both?

332
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,200
Well, none of the above.

333
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,400
Actually,
I think that you are quite rational,

334
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,720
and despite your wounds
you're in very good health.

335
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,840
But there is another possibility
that is of concern.

336
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,200
Epilepsy.

337
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,440
Epilepsy?

338
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,400
We've run some preliminary tests,

339
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:44,440
and, all things considered,
I think it might explain a lot.

340
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,720
But that seems impossible.

341
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,640
How can you just wake up one day
and have that?

342
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:54,040
Well, you can't, but, uh,
you described blunt trauma to the head,

343
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,120
disturbing hallucinations.
You're hearing voices.

344
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,720
- These could all indicate epilepsy.
- So what do we do now?

345
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,600
We're gonna insert some electrodes
into the upper neo-cortex.

346
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,120
Wait a minute, wait.
You want to put wires inside my head?

347
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,840
Frankie, we're gonna do whatever we can
to find out what's causing this.

348
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,320
You hang in there.

349
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,120
Epilepsy?

350
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,040
- You should get a second opinion.
- Miss Paige?

351
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,560
I'm Father Durning.

352
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,640
You spoke to me on the train.

353
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,960
- I'd like to talk about what happened.
- Why?

354
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:48,680
Do you know what the stigmata are?

355
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,600
Father,
I gotta get Frankie home. Thanks.

356
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,760
I understand how you feel, but please
call me if you change your mind.

357
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,480
Andrew, come in.

358
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,000
I think we've found your next assignment.

359
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,640
I was hoping you'd changed your mind
about sending me to Belo Quinto.

360
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,560
We have no record
of a church in Belo Quinto.

361
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,760
What? That's impossible.
There must be some mistake.

362
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,960
No mistake, Father.
I have checked into it myself.

363
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,160
If there is a church in Belo Quinto,
it is not one of ours.

364
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,480
And no record of a priest there, either.

365
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,120
This was sent by a Father Durning in
Pittsburgh, from the train security camera.

366
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,400
What are we supposed to be looking for?

367
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,680
Watch.

368
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,360
Stop.

369
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,560
Obviously it is some sort of attack.

370
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,920
Maybe possession.
The wrists are bandaged.

371
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:50,440
According to Father Durning,
she was whipped repeatedly

372
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,760
by an unseen force.

373
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:56,560
- How important is this really, Daniel?
- We don't know yet.

374
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,920
Then why are you sending me?

375
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:02,280
Because of this clipping
from the Pittsburgh Globe.

376
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,880
"Twenty terrified witnesses...
unexplained wounds...

377
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,840
.. Catholic priest."
The publicity is unfortunate,

378
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,480
but by the time I get there
it will have blown over.

379
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:14,560
We're investigating this one.

380
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,840
You know what I heard?

381
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,600
Catholic priest in the paper said
that it was something like...

382
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,920
- Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

383
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,000
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

384
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,800
Hey, I feel like I should do a monologue.

385
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:54,320
Hey, Cheryl. Come on over here
and have a seat. I'll just be a second.

386
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,960
You know what?
I think I'm just gonna wait for Donna.

387
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,000
Oh. OK.

388
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,600
- What's going on with her?
- She wants to get a second opinion.

389
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,000
- They think she might have epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?

390
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,960
She doesn't look too good.

391
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,000
- Why is she even at work?
- Hey! Would you guys stop whispering

392
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,360
like this was a goddamn church!

393
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,160
- Hi.
- Hello.

394
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,240
Do you have an appointment, or...

395
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,040
No, I don't.

396
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,080
Would you like a haircut, a manicure,
or maybe you'd like your nipples pierced?

397
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,440
Well, maybe if we just start with a trim,
we could go from there.

398
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,720
- Thank you.
- Come on. Have a seat.

399
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,960
Here we go. I'll put this cape on
so you don't get a scratchy neck.

400
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,240
Thank you.

401
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,960
So, where are you from?

402
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,760
I live in Rome, actually.

403
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,360
- Cool.
- And you?

404
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,440
- I'm from Naples.
- Naples.

405
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,040
Naples, la citta piu bella del mondo.

406
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,760
Naples, Florida.
I moved here to go to school.

407
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,840
Which school?

408
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:23,080
Claudia's University of Cosmetology.
See, I'm accredited.

409
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:25,520
Oh. Cool.

410
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,200
Am I going crazy,
or is Frankie hitting on a priest?

411
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:34,200
What do I call you? I feel weird
calling a guy I could date "Father".

412
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:38,600
I mean, I couldn't date you,
but... you know.

413
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,200
Oh, no, you just made my day.

414
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:44,560
Thank you. You can call me Andrew.

415
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,760
Andrew Kiernan, that's my name.

416
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,280
Donna.

417
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:02,320
I know this is gonna sound
kinda strange, but

418
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,800
I've sorta been expecting you.

419
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,920
- So, you live in Rome?
- Yes, but I travel a lot, so I'm rarely there.

420
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,800
- Thank you.
- Coffee, honey?

421
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,920
No, thanks.
So what brings you to Pennsylvania?

422
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:22,800
Father Durning asked us
to speak to you, Miss Paige.

423
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,080
Us? Who's us?
I thought you were a priest.

424
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,160
I am, but I'm also an investigator.
I work for a division in the Vatican

425
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:32,360
called the Congregation for
the Causes of the Saints.

426
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,040
- Do you mind if I switch this on?
- No, go ahead.

427
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,560
What is... What is your full name?

428
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,640
Frankie Paige.

429
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,400
- And your age?
- 23.

430
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,040
- And... which church do you attend?
- I don't attend church.

431
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,120
But you are Catholic?

432
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,920
No, I don't go to church
because I don't believe in God.

433
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,800
Well... that's gonna be it for me.
That's all I need to know, Miss Paige.

434
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,600
That's it?

435
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,160
Yes.

436
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,440
You see, stigmatics are
deeply religious people.

437
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,440
And there's no exceptions?

438
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,680
- No.
- Well, why do they get stigmata?

439
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:17,040
When Christ died on the cross
he... he died with

440
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,680
five wounds.

441
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,800
His back was scourged by whips.

442
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,520
There were gashes in his forehead
from a crown of thorns.

443
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,600
There were nails driven through
his hands and feet.

444
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,960
And finally a spear

445
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,720
driven through his side.

446
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,240
Throughout history

447
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,480
only deeply devout people have been

448
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,560
afflicted with these wounds.

449
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,160
Why?

450
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,680
There is no scientific explanation.

451
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,560
All stigmatics are haunted
by such intense spiritual pain.

452
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,280
In some ways it affects them physically.
They're assaulted by visions of evil,

453
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,120
and they manifest this battle
in their bodies.

454
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:01,320
The Church, on the other hand,
regards it as a gift.

455
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,760
A gift from God.

456
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,920
A gift? Can I give it back?

457
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:14,480
Listen, Father, can I show you these
and you could tell me what you think?

458
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,640
Yes. Yes, of course.

459
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,440
Coffee, honey?

460
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,400
Well, what do you think?

461
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,000
- It doesn't really matter what I think.
- What does that mean?

462
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,760
It means officially
this is not a case for the Church.

463
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:04,160
To say that a self-confessed atheist
exhibits the wounds of Christ

464
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,320
- is a contradiction in terms.
- Here.

465
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,720
Read that. I found that on my kitchen
table the other morning.

466
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,080
Now, I don't know what that says,
but that handwriting is mine.

467
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,720
It's Italian.

468
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:18,960
It says, "Split a piece of wood
and I'm there."

469
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:22,040
"Lift a stone and you will find me."

470
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:25,520
- It's quite beautiful, actually.
- This isn't beautiful!

471
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,320
This is a warning!
It means no matter what I do,...

472
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,480
- Miss Paige...
- .. I can't escape it.

473
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:34,520
- Miss Paige, I would really like to help...
- You know what?

474
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,600
This is not going anywhere.
You don't know what this is.

475
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,640
You can't give me an answer.
Coffee's on me. Here.

476
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:12,920
There is no scientific explanation.

477
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,600
Stigmatics are deeply religious people.

478
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,200
We're gonna do whatever we can

479
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,880
to find out, but, all things considered,
I think it might explain a lot.

480
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:32,520
Throughout history,
only people who believe deeply in God

481
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,760
have been afflicted with these wounds.
The nearer they come to God,

482
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,560
the more open they are
to the torment of their demons.

483
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:42,000
The Church regards it as a gift.

484
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,920
A gift from God.

485
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,640
- Here's to Friday night.
- Yeah. To Friday night, honey.

486
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,080
Frankie!

487
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:09,240
Don't worry. Order another drink.
I'll be right back. I'm gonna check it out.

488
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,760
But you just can't tell

489
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:13,320
Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

490
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,320
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hey.

491
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,640
- What's up? I thought you were resting.
- Have you seen Steven?

492
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,560
Forget about Steven.
What's up with that priest?

493
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:23,600
Believe me, he's all business.

494
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,840
Hey, can we get two doubles each?

495
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,920
Hey, you know what's scarier
than not believing in God?

496
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,360
Believing in him.

497
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,240
I mean really believing in him
is a fucking terrifying thought.

498
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,040
It's Friday night.
You're taking things too seriously.

499
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,240
If there is a God, he hates me.
He's ruining my life.

500
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,760
Frankie, it's gonna be all right. Man, relax.

501
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:46,240
You don't get it, do you?
I have fucking holes through my wrists!

502
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,760
I have slashes across my back!

503
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:51,960
If it isn't God that's doing this to me,
then who is?

504
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,320
I think you're losing it, man.

505
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,080
Where you goin'?

506
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,520
Frankie!

507
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:12,840
Frankie!

508
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,200
Frankie, get up!

509
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,440
Get up! Frankie!

510
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,360
Don't just fuckin' stand there!
Call an ambulance!

511
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:31,320
Damn.

512
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,640
Frankie, where are you?!

513
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,680
Get out of there!

514
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,040
Miss Paige?

515
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,000
Frankie!

516
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:39,240
- Let's get you outta here.
- Frankie.

517
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:44,840
- We need to get her to a safe place.
- Here, I got you. I got you.

518
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,720
- Welcome back.
- Where am I?

519
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:24,240
You're in Father Durning's church.

520
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,880
Here.

521
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:29,960
I think she should get some rest.

522
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,720
You all right?

523
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,360
You look like shit.

524
00:47:39,520 --> 00:47:41,440
It smells like...

525
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,160
flowers.

526
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,640
You've got stuff all in your hair.

527
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:10,680
Pronto.

528
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,400
- Gianni, come stai?
- Andrew, how are you?

529
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:14,680
Gianni, listen...

530
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:17,800
- Could you translate something?
- Si. Do you have it there?

531
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:20,120
Yes, I have it here. I'll play it.

532
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:32,040
Thama...

533
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,440
- Well, what is it? Is it gibberish?
- No, it's not gibberish at all.

534
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,320
Who is speaking?

535
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:49,360
- Morning, Miss Paige. You're up early.
- Hey, I think you made a mistake.

536
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,880
- What do you mean?
- I can't have stigmata.

537
00:49:52,040 --> 00:49:55,600
Jesus was crucified through
the palms of his hands, not his wrists.

538
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,640
My wounds are through the wrists.
So you're wrong.

539
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,680
Actually, scientists have discovered that
in Roman times people were crucified

540
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:06,040
through the wrists, not the palms.

541
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:08,600
The hands couldn't support
the body weight,

542
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,000
so they did crucify them
through the wrists.

543
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:15,680
No, wait, you're telling me
that every painting,

544
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,840
every statue of Christ,

545
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,840
every single crucifix
in the whole world is wrong?

546
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,360
No, no, just inaccurate.
They're impressions of the truth.

547
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,000
Icons are meant to be inspirational.

548
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,240
Miss Paige,
there's something else you should know.

549
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,120
The words you keep repeating
that, uh, you thought were nonsense.

550
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:38,080
It's not.

551
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,160
It's actually a very specific language.
It's a form of Aramaic.

552
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,360
What?

553
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:47,720
It's a form of Aramaic
that hasn't been used for 1900 years.

554
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:51,120
It's a dialect that was used in Galilee
around the time of Jesus.

555
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:33,920
Split a piece of wood and I am there.

556
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,000
Lift a stone and you will find me.

557
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,360
- Did you get through?
- No.

558
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:34,440
Her machine didn't even pick up.

559
00:52:58,440 --> 00:53:00,360
Miss Paige?

560
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,400
Frankie?

561
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,080
Who are you?

562
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:16,280
The messenger is not important.

563
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,440
I feel like my heart is breaking.

564
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,960
Why am I so sad?

565
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:15,680
It smells like flowers in here.

566
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:21,120
Like... jasmine or...

567
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:24,960
.. rose or something.

568
00:56:25,600 --> 00:56:28,160
- Can you smell that?
- Yes, I can.

569
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:34,080
- Who wrote that?
- You did.

570
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:37,120
- I wrote that?!
- Yes.

571
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,440
- Have you heard from Father Andrew?
- No, Eminence.

572
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,480
- He hasn't filed a report.
- What are these?

573
00:56:55,640 --> 00:56:58,880
These are newspaper clippings
from our office in New York.

574
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,200
The first one is from Pennsylvania.

575
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,040
The others are from New York
and Washington.

576
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:08,400
These are even more damaging.
This one mentions the stigmata.

577
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,440
- He isn't defusing the situation.
- Shall I call him home?

578
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:17,520
Have him conclude his investigation
and report to me in New York next week.

579
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:25,520
Frankie, can you please come over here
and have a look at this?

580
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,800
I just can't believe that none of this
means anything to you.

581
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:34,080
Frankie?

582
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,880
Frankie, can you please...

583
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:49,760
Can you please look at this?

584
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:54,280
Sometimes subjects retain fragments
or images that can be transmitted

585
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,520
subconsciously.

586
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:59,440
This subject doesn't retain
fragments of images.

587
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:04,080
You don't get it, do you, Father Kiernan?
I don't know what the hell that means!

588
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:08,200
I don't know what the hell this means.
I just want my life back, OK?

589
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,640
I'm sitting amongst yourselves

590
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:22,800
Don't think you can see me

591
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:26,920
I haven't gone anywhere

592
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,520
But out of my body

593
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,480
Reach out and touch me

594
00:58:37,400 --> 00:58:41,200
Make effort to speak to me

595
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,720
Call out and you'll hear me

596
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:49,920
Be happy for me...

597
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:51,920
Miss Paige?

598
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:55,760
Miss Paige, I'm sorry.

599
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:58,800
Don't "Miss Paige" me
just because you messed up.

600
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,160
I'm not gonna let you off the hook.

601
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:04,480
OK, but I am sorry.

602
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:07,560
You know, for a priest
you're pretty relentless.

603
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,080
Yeah, I guess I stopped being a priest
and slipped back into being a scientist.

604
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,120
It happens.

605
00:59:14,280 --> 00:59:17,240
Hey, what kind of a scientist
is a priest, anyway?

606
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:19,320
You don't want to know.

607
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,680
Oh, yes, I do!

608
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:23,640
You were an organic chemist?

609
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:26,360
Did you walk around
with those glasses

610
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:30,080
with Scotch tape around the sides,
and pocket protectors?

611
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,360
I did, actually.

612
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:36,680
Anyway, one day I just decided that
I was going to become a priest.

613
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:37,760
Why?

614
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:40,080
- The holes.
- The holes?

615
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,520
- The holes in the theories.
- What theories?

616
00:59:42,680 --> 00:59:44,760
The world is six billion years old.

617
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:49,640
There's been life for three billion years,
but before that there was nothing.

618
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,040
No life.
Just a bunch of elements swirling around.

619
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:56,200
And then one day,
for no apparent reason whatsoever,

620
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:59,280
all these elements
came together in perfect harmony

621
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,320
and there was suddenly life.

622
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:04,840
Living things like lilac
and... and hedgehogs and...

623
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:06,920
Beer and... cheesecake.

624
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,320
Beer and cheesecake.
Did you know monks invented alcohol?

625
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:13,040
- Yeah. Everybody knows that.
- You knew that?

626
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:14,080
Yeah.

627
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:17,920
Well, anyway, to get back to the big hole.
There really...

628
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:20,320
There really isn't any explanation.

629
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,800
And, I figured that
there was something more than

630
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:26,960
well, more important than
organic chemistry going on,

631
01:00:27,120 --> 01:00:29,240
and I figured that... it was God.

632
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:32,880
And that God was responsible
for all this... life.

633
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:36,320
- I really can't get a line on you.
- Why not?

634
01:00:36,480 --> 01:00:40,760
- I can't understand a man who's never...
- Never made love to a woman?

635
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:44,480
Well, this may come
as a great surprise to you, but

636
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:46,800
I wasn't born a priest.

637
01:00:48,160 --> 01:00:50,400
- You didn't like it?
- What's not to like?

638
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:53,600
- But you don't miss it?
- Yes, of course I miss it.

639
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,240
I mean, I'm human, you know.

640
01:00:56,400 --> 01:01:01,640
I struggle with it, but I've made a choice.
Basically, I've exchanged

641
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,720
one set of complications for another.

642
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,600
So this is the fourth?

643
01:02:16,760 --> 01:02:19,320
- What do you mean?
- When I first met you,

644
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:22,360
didn't you say that
there were five wounds?

645
01:02:22,520 --> 01:02:25,760
Well, this is the fourth. What's the fifth?

646
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,480
The spear.

647
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:32,040
That's the wound that killed him.

648
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,120
Don't worry, Frankie.

649
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:37,520
No stigmatic has ever received
the full five wounds.

650
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:40,920
Have you ever met another person
who had stigmata?

651
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:45,720
I did make a pilgrimage to a small village
in the mountains of southern Italy.

652
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,080
There I met a priest called Padre Pio.

653
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:51,320
He first received the wounds
when he was 23 years of age,

654
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:54,080
the same age as Saint Francis of Assisi.

655
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:56,160
Who's Saint Francis of Assisi?

656
01:02:56,320 --> 01:03:01,440
Saint Francis was the first person
to receive the stigmata, in the 13thC.

657
01:03:01,560 --> 01:03:04,800
He was a wild young man,
who suddenly changed his ways

658
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:08,800
after he'd had a vision
of being crucified alongside Christ.

659
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:13,840
When he woke up, his hands
and his feet were... were bleeding.

660
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,000
This priest,
were his wounds as bad as mine?

661
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,680
Padre Pio.

662
01:03:18,840 --> 01:03:23,760
Sometimes he lost a pint of blood a day.
And he suffered terrible demonic attacks.

663
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:24,920
A priest?

664
01:03:25,080 --> 01:03:29,240
All stigmatics suffer
the most intense spiritual conflict.

665
01:03:29,400 --> 01:03:31,280
The nearer they come to God,

666
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,080
the more open they are to temptation,
to evil visions,

667
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:38,160
to the torment of their demons.

668
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:43,040
A smell accompanies the wounds.
The odor of sanctity, the smell of...

669
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:44,120
Flowers?

670
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:45,800
Yes.

671
01:03:46,560 --> 01:03:47,640
Flowers.

672
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:51,040
Well, what happened to him?

673
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:53,520
How many wounds did he receive?

674
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,600
He...

675
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:58,520
He lived to old age.

676
01:03:58,680 --> 01:04:01,240
How many wounds did he receive?

677
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,000
Two.

678
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,400
I'm dying, aren't I?

679
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,200
This thing is killing me.

680
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,560
Here's a closer shot.

681
01:04:43,720 --> 01:04:45,880
My guess is it's probably Aramaic.

682
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,200
Aspetta.

683
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:49,280
I'm looking at it.

684
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,480
Is there a... Is there a problem, Gianni?

685
01:04:52,640 --> 01:04:55,320
Yes. Don't send me any more pictures.

686
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:57,720
- How many did you send?
- Six. Why?

687
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:01,240
- The problem is what it says.
- Well, what does it say?

688
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:05,680
It says, "The kingdom of God is
inside you, and all about you."

689
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,720
Andrew, forget you saw this.

690
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:11,280
- Drop it immediately.
- Gianni, what is the problem?

691
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:14,120
Do you remember the Gospels...

692
01:05:15,560 --> 01:05:18,800
Gianni? Gianni, are you still there?

693
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,320
Do you remember
the Gospels Commission?

694
01:05:21,480 --> 01:05:24,720
It was closed down suddenly
by your friend Cardinal Houseman.

695
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,680
Yes, a few years ago, yes.

696
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:30,280
We discovered a document that
looked like a completely new gospel.

697
01:05:30,440 --> 01:05:33,080
- What's the significance?
- I was one of the three

698
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:37,520
translators of this gospel.
It was written entirely in Aramaic.

699
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,840
The language of Jesus and his disciples.

700
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,000
It may be Jesus’ actual words.

701
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:44,240
He's...

702
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:48,360
Where is it now?

703
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,280
Gianni? What's going on?

704
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,000
Are you there?

705
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:53,920
Gianni?

706
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:00,880
Buona sera.

707
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,480
What's this?

708
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:12,320
Is that a painting?

709
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,440
- No, it's a mirror.
- Who else was there?

710
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,720
- I don't know.
- I thought you said it was just you two.

711
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,320
16a. Do you have the neg?

712
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:24,880
Who is that?

713
01:06:30,080 --> 01:06:32,400
I'll be back as soon as I can.

714
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,120
- Cardinal Houseman.
- I'm late for a meeting.

715
01:06:59,280 --> 01:07:02,240
- I think this might be of interest.
- What is it?

716
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:11,320
- Where did you get this?
- It was e-mailed to Father Delmonico.

717
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,440
- By who?
- Father Kiernan in Pittsburgh.

718
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,640
- Do you know what it means?
- No.

719
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:19,800
Is it important?

720
01:07:19,960 --> 01:07:23,600
Will you tell the meeting
I'll be with them in a few minutes?

721
01:07:28,360 --> 01:07:29,920
New York City

722
01:07:32,200 --> 01:07:33,600
Who is it?

723
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:36,040
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

724
01:07:36,200 --> 01:07:37,520
Who's this?

725
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,120
It's an old friend.

726
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:43,400
- Delmonico? What's happened?
- The missing Jesus gospel... It turned up.

727
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,880
That's impossible.

728
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:45,840
Alameida...

729
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,280
Alameida?

730
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,440
In the United States. Pittsburgh.

731
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:50,760
Send me something.

732
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,840
No. No, I can't.

733
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:54,920
Houseman will kill me.

734
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:16,600
Hi, come in. The door's open.

735
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:25,160
Frankie?

736
01:08:25,320 --> 01:08:27,240
I'm in here!

737
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:35,360
How you doin'? Want a beer?

738
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:37,080
Sure.

739
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,280
- Check these out. They're getting better.
- That's great.

740
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,840
Really good.

741
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:51,680
You'll be able to get
these stitches out soon.

742
01:08:51,840 --> 01:08:53,760
That's great.

743
01:08:53,920 --> 01:08:55,840
Let me see your forehead.

744
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,640
- Does this... Does this hurt?
- No.

745
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,840
Great. You'll...

746
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:30,040
Why did you paint over the wall?

747
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:33,040
I got bored, and I got sick
of looking at that thing.

748
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:13,280
I really wish you weren't wearing
that uniform right now.

749
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:15,720
It's got nothing to do with the uniform.

750
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:19,000
Well, what is it? You took a vow
to be dead from the neck down?

751
01:10:21,040 --> 01:10:22,640
Come on!

752
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,120
I've seen the way you look at me.
You know the way that I feel about you.

753
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,360
Come on, I'm not blind. It's OK.

754
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:31,560
No.

755
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:35,880
Why, because I...
I painted the wall out? Is that it?

756
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:38,880
So now I'm no use to you, right? Is that it?

757
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,400
Answer me!

758
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:46,640
You are so proud of your holy abstinence!

759
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,400
Like touching a woman would kill you!

760
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:53,600
Women are dirty little complications!

761
01:10:56,560 --> 01:10:58,480
That's why you became a priest.

762
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:02,360
It has nothing to do
with your convenient little stories!

763
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:10,520
Oh, you're so proud of your church,

764
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:13,360
of virgins and eunuchs!

765
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:45,960
How's your faith these days, Father?

766
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,440
How's your faith these days?!

767
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,360
This is what you fucking call God?

768
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:56,560
Blood of Christ!

769
01:15:04,600 --> 01:15:09,000
- I've never seen you pray before.
- I haven't prayed for a very long time.

770
01:15:11,160 --> 01:15:12,880
Come here.

771
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:17,160
It's OK. Come on.

772
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:20,360
Go in.

773
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:37,080
- Daniel.
- We've come to help.

774
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:40,600
Take her to the archdiocese.

775
01:16:59,640 --> 01:17:02,440
I'll be downstairs if you need me, Sister.

776
01:17:07,960 --> 01:17:10,840
Where did you get this from, hm?
What does it mean?

777
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,760
The girl wrote it.
I don't know what it means.

778
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:15,840
Neither does she.

779
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:17,920
Why was it painted over?

780
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:21,360
- What language is it in?
- It's Aramaic.

781
01:17:21,520 --> 01:17:23,880
How do you know that?

782
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:26,440
- That's irrelevant.
- What I don't understand

783
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,800
is why you would send this
to anyone other than me.

784
01:17:29,960 --> 01:17:32,320
- What are you hiding?
- All I know is

785
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,760
that the girl is fighting for her life.

786
01:17:34,920 --> 01:17:38,800
If she receives another wound
she's going to die unless we help her.

787
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,840
Right. I'm taking over.

788
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,280
- Get some rest.
- I'm not leaving her alone.

789
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:45,840
You're leaving her
in the care of the sisters.

790
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:48,320
You sent me here.
I didn't want to come.

791
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,200
You told me to deal with her.
That's what I'm doing!

792
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:53,920
She's in no condition
to take on you or the Church.

793
01:17:54,040 --> 01:17:57,080
This is not about a girl
taking on me or taking on the Church!

794
01:17:57,240 --> 01:18:00,840
Why are you more concerned
about photographs than a girl dying?

795
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,520
- Andrew, where's your loyalty?
- Don't you lecture me about loyalty.

796
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,680
The only reason
you've been tolerated for so long

797
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:10,120
is because you were a good scientist.

798
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:13,120
Because of your objectivity.
Well, you've lost that.

799
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:17,760
The last thing I expected to see in
that girl’s apartment was the two of you

800
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:20,040
- Lying on a bed together.
- Oh, come on!

801
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,720
You think you're helping her,
but you're not. She's getting worse.

802
01:18:23,880 --> 01:18:28,840
Andrew, you're in no state to help anyone
right now. You're exhausted.

803
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:32,520
Go to Father Durning's. Get some rest.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

804
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:35,480
Why are you so concerned
with these photographs?

805
01:18:35,640 --> 01:18:38,520
Father Delmonico seemed to think
they were important.

806
01:18:38,680 --> 01:18:42,200
- What do they mean?
- We've no idea, but we're working on it.

807
01:18:42,360 --> 01:18:46,040
- Is it to do with the Gospel Commission?
- We don't know.

808
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:48,120
Good night, Andrew.

809
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,480
Andrew Kiernan?

810
01:19:21,440 --> 01:19:23,840
- I'm Kiernan.
- I want to see Alameida.

811
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,480
I don't know any Alameida.

812
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:29,080
Delmonico faxed me this copy
of his document.

813
01:19:29,240 --> 01:19:32,080
The girl wrote this. I saw her do it.
What is this?

814
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:36,640
It's maybe the most significant
Christian relic ever found.

815
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,000
Why?

816
01:19:38,160 --> 01:19:41,240
It's an Aramaic scroll
from the first century,

817
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:46,320
discovered near the caves of the
Dead Sea Scrolls, outside Jerusalem.

818
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:48,800
Alameida and I concluded that

819
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:53,320
it is a gospel... of Jesus Christ,

820
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:56,160
in his own words... Aramaic.

821
01:19:56,320 --> 01:20:00,840
But there are some factions in the Vatican
who believe that this document

822
01:20:01,000 --> 01:20:04,240
could destroy the authority
of the modern Church.

823
01:20:04,400 --> 01:20:05,920
How?

824
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:11,400
It was Jesus' words to his disciples
on the night of his Last Supper.

825
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:17,240
His instructions to them on how to
continue his church after his death.

826
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:19,840
Why would that be so... so threatening?

827
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,600
When we gave our initial conclusions
to the Gospel Commission,

828
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:26,320
Houseman ordered us
to stop immediately.

829
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:29,160
Alameida refused.
He stole the document and disappeared.

830
01:20:29,320 --> 01:20:31,880
Houseman excommunicated us
in our absence.

831
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:34,000
You have no idea where he is?

832
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:38,520
He doesn't want to be caught
until he finishes the translation.

833
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:40,760
I'll show you this guy.

834
01:20:40,920 --> 01:20:45,080
That's Delmonico, me and Alameida.
We were all translating the new gospel.

835
01:20:45,240 --> 01:20:48,840
I've seen this man.
Three weeks ago, in Brazil.

836
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:50,880
- Yeah?
- He's dead.

837
01:20:51,040 --> 01:20:52,360
How do you know this?

838
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:56,680
Because I saw him in his coffin
in a church in Belo Quinto. I'm sorry.

839
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:02,960
Then it's all over. It's gone for ever.

840
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:05,640
Why was your work stopped?

841
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,280
What was so threatening
about this gospel?

842
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:11,920
- Look around you. What do you see?
- I see a church.

843
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:13,560
It's a building.

844
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,280
The true church of Jesus Christ
is so much more.

845
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,040
Not in buildings made of wood and stone.

846
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:21,880
I love Jesus!

847
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:25,000
I don't need an institution
between him and me.

848
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,200
You see, just God and man.

849
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,400
No priests, no churches.

850
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,640
The first words in Jesus' gospel are,

851
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:36,280
"The kingdom of God is inside you,

852
01:21:36,440 --> 01:21:39,000
and all around you."

853
01:21:39,160 --> 01:21:42,480
"Not in buildings of wood and stone."

854
01:21:42,640 --> 01:21:45,600
"Split a piece of wood and I am there."

855
01:21:45,760 --> 01:21:48,680
- "Lift a stone and...
- .. you will find me."

856
01:21:48,840 --> 01:21:50,720
Yes, brother.

857
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:57,280
Why is Father Alameida wearing gloves?

858
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,280
Alameida was a tormented man.

859
01:21:59,440 --> 01:22:02,000
Holy man. A very holy man.

860
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:06,640
He wore the gloves
to cover the marks of the stigmata.

861
01:22:11,720 --> 01:22:13,600
She has the stigmata.

862
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,680
That's why.

863
01:22:18,320 --> 01:22:20,240
She's just his messenger.

864
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:23,480
Houseman will never let
this gospel get out.

865
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,280
Almighty God,
bless your humble servant,

866
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:31,160
guide me with your Holy Spirit,
and forgive me

867
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:34,720
for I have sinned exceedingly
in thought, word and deed.

868
01:22:54,440 --> 01:22:56,360
My sins deserve your punishments

869
01:22:56,520 --> 01:23:00,000
because they have crucified
my loving Savior, Jesus Christ.

870
01:23:00,160 --> 01:23:02,040
Amen.

871
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,240
Lord,

872
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:35,240
do not remember our sins,
or those of our forefathers.

873
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:38,280
- Where's Andrew?
- And do not punish us for our offences.

874
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,000
Lead us not into temptation.

875
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:43,560
Save this woman, your servant.

876
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,600
Spirit of lust,
by the power of Jesus Christ

877
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:49,920
I command you, come out of her body
now and for always.

878
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:52,040
In the name of Jesus Christ
I command you

879
01:23:52,200 --> 01:23:54,280
come out of her body now
and for always.

880
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:56,920
In the name of Jesus Christ...

881
01:23:57,080 --> 01:23:59,320
You are blind men.

882
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:01,000
Your eyes are open.

883
01:24:01,160 --> 01:24:02,680
But you see nothing.

884
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:06,960
Why do you persecute me?!

885
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:09,760
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord!

886
01:24:13,240 --> 01:24:16,520
Lord, hear my prayer!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

887
01:24:16,680 --> 01:24:18,200
Behold

888
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:19,640
your servant,

889
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,720
dripping with blood!

890
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:28,400
Embrace me, my child. I am the Church.

891
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,640
You are the true enemy
of the Church, Houseman.

892
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:33,120
I am the Church.

893
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:35,200
- Stop!
- Get away from me!

894
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:39,560
Get them out of here!
Get out of here! Get out!

895
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,600
- Eminenza!
- Get out!

896
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:46,400
Save this woman from woe. O Lord,

897
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:49,000
save this woman, your servant.

898
01:24:53,960 --> 01:24:56,200
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord.

899
01:24:56,360 --> 01:24:59,040
Give her heavenly protection.

900
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:05,880
Save this woman, O Lord!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

901
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,280
Send her help from the holy place.

902
01:25:17,360 --> 01:25:18,440
Frankie!

903
01:25:18,600 --> 01:25:21,200
You will not destroy my Church.

904
01:25:30,080 --> 01:25:31,240
Frankie!

905
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,280
You must not interrupt.

906
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:37,720
What are you doing?! Get away from her!

907
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,560
- Get away from her!
- No! No!

908
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:42,640
Get away!

909
01:25:44,440 --> 01:25:46,640
It's all right. I know what...

910
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,120
Andrew!

911
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:50,400
Get away from her!
You don't know what's going on here!

912
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:53,120
You get off me! You lied to me!

913
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:56,880
You tried to silence her.
You lied to me, you bastard!

914
01:25:57,640 --> 01:26:00,120
- Andrew...
- You tried to kill her!

915
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:05,440
I know everything. I know why you
closed down the Gospel Commission,

916
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:08,600
why you had Petrocelli
and Alameida excommunicated,

917
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,480
all about the lies
you've been telling for years.

918
01:26:11,640 --> 01:26:13,840
You won't get away with
what you did to her!

919
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:16,200
I will not let you destroy the Church.

920
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:21,920
I promise you,
you've spent your last days in the Church.

921
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:38,120
Are you Paolo Alameida?

922
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:48,560
Give me your wisdom.
Let me be your messenger.

923
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,760
A messenger believes.

924
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:55,240
A messenger has faith.
You have only doubt.

925
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,160
Jesus said, "The kingdom of God

926
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,560
is inside you and all around you,

927
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,520
not in mansions of wood and stone."

928
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:29,680
"Split a piece of wood and I am there."

929
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,120
"Lift a stone... and you will find me."

930
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:40,360
Brother Alameida,
I call upon you to release this woman.

931
01:27:40,520 --> 01:27:43,920
Give her grace and let her not
come into the ways of harm.

932
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,120
Through Jesus Christ we have
all been saved. Let us not fear any ill.

933
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,960
Jesus is with us

934
01:27:50,120 --> 01:27:53,720
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
world without end, for ever and ever.

935
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:00,200
God bless your soul, Brother Alameida.

936
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:02,480
Go in peace.

937
01:29:04,360 --> 01:29:06,320
Don't go, Frankie.

938
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,280
Stay with me.

939
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:15,760
Jesus said,
"The kingdom of God is inside you

940
01:31:15,920 --> 01:31:19,360
and all around you...
not in mansions of wood and stone."

941
01:31:19,520 --> 01:31:23,040
"The kingdom of God
is inside you, and all around you."
