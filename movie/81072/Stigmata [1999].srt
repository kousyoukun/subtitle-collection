1
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:36,241
- Are you the investigator?
- Yes.

2
00:02:36,407 --> 00:02:38,743
Thank God you've come.

3
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,912
Who's in charge here?

4
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:43,998
Father Alameida was.

5
00:04:19,636 --> 00:04:22,347
Look! How much proof do you need?!

6
00:04:42,283 --> 00:04:44,744
Has the statue been removed
from the church for any reason?

7
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:47,872
No. The statue only started crying
on the day Father Alameida died.

8
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:51,125
The day the doves came back.

9
00:04:51,292 --> 00:04:54,295
The people of the village loved Alameida.

10
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:01,135
The tears of the Mother
are the blood of Christ.

11
00:05:07,183 --> 00:05:10,770
I suggest you clear the church.
I have to crate the statue up.

12
00:05:12,272 --> 00:05:15,191
- Crate it up?
- Yes.

13
00:05:16,067 --> 00:05:18,987
Father Alameida would
never have allowed that.

14
00:05:41,926 --> 00:05:44,929
Ma'am? This is Father Alameida's
own rosary...

15
00:05:48,933 --> 00:05:52,604
- No, lady, you really shouldn't buy that.
- No, I like it... How much?

16
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:55,273
You shouldn't do that!
You're stealing from the dead!

17
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:08,912
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee:

18
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:11,080
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the...

19
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:22,550
No virgin, me

20
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:24,302
For I have sinned

21
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,137
I sold my soul

22
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:28,640
For sex and gin

23
00:06:28,806 --> 00:06:30,725
Go call a priest

24
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:32,352
All meek and mild

25
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,312
And tell him Mary

26
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,231
is no more a child

27
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,612
It's raining stones

28
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,739
It痴 raining bile

29
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:46,699
From the luxury

30
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:48,743
Of your denial

31
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,703
I press alarms

32
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,081
Place bets on truth

33
00:06:53,873 --> 00:06:56,459
I'm so up and down

34
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:59,838
And now I知 growing old

35
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,006
Disgracefully

36
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:05,969
Whatever happened to Mary?

37
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:09,973
Whatever happened to Mary?

38
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:14,060
Whatever happened to Mary?

39
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:18,231
Whatever happened to Mary?

40
00:07:19,023 --> 00:07:20,942
Whatever happened to...

41
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:27,991
I'll spit on floors

42
00:07:28,157 --> 00:07:29,951
And do more drugs

43
00:07:30,118 --> 00:07:31,911
Burn every bill

44
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:34,205
Get drunk on love

45
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:35,957
Wear next to nothing...

46
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:39,669
Hey, Frankie, sweetheart!

47
00:07:39,836 --> 00:07:41,963
Let's go. I'm trashed.

48
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,507
Are you too tired to go home with me?

49
00:07:44,674 --> 00:07:46,384
I'm tired, not dead.

50
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:48,720
I値l be uncareful

51
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:50,305
I値l cause such scenes

52
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:52,223
And I値l never talk

53
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,309
Of used-to-be's

54
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,436
Tattoo my face

55
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,438
I won't go grey

56
00:07:58,605 --> 00:08:00,440
Be a dancing queen

57
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:03,067
I知 growing old disgracefully

58
00:08:03,359 --> 00:08:06,070
I知 so up and down

59
00:08:06,863 --> 00:08:10,325
And I love what's not allowed

60
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:12,410
I was lost

61
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:14,579
Now I see

62
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:20,001
And now I知 growing old disgracefully

63
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,230
Oh, hi, Mom.

64
00:09:22,397 --> 00:09:25,316
How do you do that?
How did you know that was me?

65
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:28,069
You have the most persistent ring I know.

66
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:31,781
ljust wanted to say hi while
I知 near a phone. How are you?

67
00:09:31,948 --> 00:09:33,199
Where are you?

68
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,493
Belo Quinto, near Rio.

69
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,037
Mom, hold on, I'm getting another call.

70
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,163
Hello?

71
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,000
It痴 about time. Where you been, baby?

72
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,961
I hate it when you just leave.
You could say goodbye.

73
00:09:45,128 --> 00:09:46,087
Why?

74
00:09:46,254 --> 00:09:48,548
''Why?'' Forget it.

75
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:52,385
Look, I got my mom on the other line.
I値l see you tonight.

76
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:54,554
AII right, I値l see you later.

77
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:57,891
Mom? Hi, I'm back.
So how do you like Rio?

78
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:02,020
- It was great. Did you get my package?
- Yeah, I got it yesterday.

79
00:10:02,187 --> 00:10:06,691
- What did you think? Did you open it yet?
- Hold on, I'm gonna change phones.

80
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:16,534
What do you think? Did you get a chance
to look at everything?

81
00:10:16,701 --> 00:10:18,369
I'm opening it now.

82
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,789
- Pretty postcards.
- Aren't those pretty?

83
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,083
- Cute brush.
- I saw a lady make that.

84
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,003
- A little hat.
- It痴 probably for a little doll.

85
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:30,423
- A necklace?
- It痴 not really a necklace. It痴 a rosary.

86
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,134
- Where did you get it?
- This little village...

87
00:10:33,301 --> 00:10:36,054
- Belo Quinto.
- I didn't know you went there.

88
00:10:36,221 --> 00:10:39,516
I took a little side trip.
So, the presents, do you love 'em?

89
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,560
I知 so glad we talked.
I知 going on that cruise.

90
00:10:42,727 --> 00:10:44,938
We won't talk for a month. I have to run.

91
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:47,607
Have fun. I love you.
I'm glad you called, Mom. Bye.

92
00:11:08,419 --> 00:11:11,172
- Can I get two lattes, please? Low fat.
- Got it.

93
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:14,300
- Just one. I'm OK.
- A bacon and egg sandwich, too.

94
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:18,221
To go. What's up?
You're not eating today?

95
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:21,057
I threw up this morning
from the smell of tea.

96
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:23,560
Late?

97
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:25,645
- Like a week.
- A week?

98
00:11:25,812 --> 00:11:28,481
I don't know. A few days. I feel weird.

99
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,942
You're so dramatic.

100
00:11:31,943 --> 00:11:34,696
I think you're just psyching yourself out.

101
00:11:34,863 --> 00:11:37,782
I feel like my heart
went to go live in my stomach.

102
00:11:38,575 --> 00:11:40,285
OK, it's not traumatic!

103
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:42,620
- What if I'm having a baby?
- With Steven?

104
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:45,290
What if I'm bringing a person
into this world?

105
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:47,458
Man, what if? You've got options.

106
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,712
I don't want to think about it.
It's making me cranky.

107
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,965
Let's get our tired asses to work
cos we are late.

108
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:56,301
You're always late. There's nothing new.

109
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:10,940
Ciao, bello!
Are you looking for a good time?

110
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:13,776
That is very kind of you,
but no, thank you.

111
00:12:13,943 --> 00:12:16,362
Come on! Have some fun! Be a man!

112
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:22,410
No problem!

113
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:24,829
We'll give you the Vatican discount!

114
00:12:56,361 --> 00:13:00,240
- Father Andrew Kiernan, welcome back.
- Cardinal Houseman.

115
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:03,201
These are interesting. What's the trick?

116
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,745
To be honest, I don't know.

117
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:08,414
They probably made a fortune out of her.

118
00:13:08,581 --> 00:13:11,125
What's... What was this?

119
00:13:11,292 --> 00:13:14,712
Infrared photographs of tears.
The statue's at room temperature,

120
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,423
but the tears show up
as white because...

121
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:21,219
- Because they're warm.
- Warm tears?

122
00:13:21,386 --> 00:13:22,804
Yes.

123
00:13:22,971 --> 00:13:29,102
My lab report and analysis confirm that
the blood is not only warm, but... human.

124
00:13:31,938 --> 00:13:35,817
I know what you're thinking,
but with all due respect, Daniel,

125
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:40,238
this isn't a fake. It's solid stone.
There is no scientific explanation.

126
00:13:40,405 --> 00:13:42,282
Andrew, you were sent to Brazil

127
00:13:42,448 --> 00:13:46,953
to investigate the appearance of
the Virgin Mary on the side of a building.

128
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,874
Yes, but in Sao Paulo I heard
about the statue, so I investigated.

129
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,834
- And?
- And what?

130
00:13:53,001 --> 00:13:56,880
- The face of the Virgin Mary?
- It's an oxidation stain

131
00:13:57,046 --> 00:14:00,550
caused by rainwater running down
untreated side walls.

132
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:03,178
Causes an optical illusion
of a veiled woman.

133
00:14:03,344 --> 00:14:05,597
Good. We値l consider the matter closed.

134
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,433
Father Dario has your next assignment.

135
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:14,189
I was hoping that perhaps you could
send me back to Belo Quinto.

136
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:15,315
Why?

137
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,568
Because I need to do
some more tests on the statue.

138
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:21,237
You've left the statue in Belo Quinto?

139
00:14:21,404 --> 00:14:24,115
Yes. I was going to take it back,

140
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:27,160
but when I saw the effect
it had on the people...

141
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,829
It's become a cornerstone of their faith.

142
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:33,917
Andrew, the cornerstone
of their faith is the Church,

143
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,085
not a crying statue.

144
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,630
You represent the Catholic Church

145
00:14:38,796 --> 00:14:42,217
and the Congregation
of the Causes of the Saints.

146
00:14:42,383 --> 00:14:47,180
Yes, I'm very well aware of that, Daniel,
but as a scientist I observe the facts.

147
00:14:47,347 --> 00:14:50,558
And the facts are that this statue
has tears of blood.

148
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:53,686
If that's the case,
you know the policy.

149
00:14:53,853 --> 00:14:57,732
The statue is brought back to the Vatican.
We conduct expert tests.

150
00:14:57,899 --> 00:15:00,443
Geologist, engineers, medical examiners.

151
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:04,572
We've examined 50 or 60 crying statues
in the last 12 months.

152
00:15:04,739 --> 00:15:06,658
Not a single one of them has...

153
00:15:06,824 --> 00:15:11,162
Yes, I'm aware of that, but I wanted you
to know that in my opinion

154
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:13,623
I think that this is different.

155
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,125
I won't allow you to go back to Brazil.

156
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:20,797
We値l send a geologist, and if he sees fit
we値l send the statue back for tests.

157
00:15:20,964 --> 00:15:25,260
Father Dario, get me all the information
you can on this church in Belo Quinto.

158
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:28,137
Thank you, Andrew.

159
00:15:30,557 --> 00:15:32,559
Thank you.

160
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:42,777
I have never seen him this way before.

161
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,615
Andrew's problem is he can't decide
if he's a scientist or a priest.

162
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:53,997
Frankie,
you are gonna drive yourself crazy.

163
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:55,123
No.

164
00:15:55,373 --> 00:15:59,794
If you're worried about being pregnant,
let's go to the store and get a test.

165
00:15:59,961 --> 00:16:02,172
- Give it a couple of days.
- Are you sure?

166
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:06,634
- I'm fine. Stop mothering me!
- AII right, girlfriend. I値l call you later.

167
00:16:06,801 --> 00:16:09,262
OK, bye. Drive safe.

168
00:16:34,746 --> 00:16:37,165
- Late?
- Like a week.

169
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:41,961
- You're always late. There's nothing new.
- What if I'm bringing a person

170
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:45,048
- into this world?
- Frankie, you've got options.

171
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:55,887
Nurse, what's going on?
I don't understand.

172
00:18:56,054 --> 00:18:58,264
- Get out of the way!
- Frankie, can you hear me?

173
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,058
I'm right here with you.

174
00:19:00,225 --> 00:19:01,601
Let's go!

175
00:19:01,768 --> 00:19:04,062
Why is there so much blood?

176
00:19:04,229 --> 00:19:05,605
Get me a clamp right now.

177
00:19:05,772 --> 00:19:08,775
AII right, CBC, electrolytes,
UA, tox screen.

178
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,237
Get me a pulse box, stat!

179
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:16,533
- Get me a tox screen and a stat CT.
- Heart rate is irregular.

180
00:19:16,699 --> 00:19:18,993
Blood pressure's off the map.
195 over 120.

181
00:19:20,203 --> 00:19:22,705
- Let's change cuffs.
- Where's the IV?

182
00:19:31,047 --> 00:19:34,259
I'm calling it. Code blue.
Get the paddles. Get some gel.

183
00:19:34,425 --> 00:19:35,510
OK, ready?

184
00:19:35,677 --> 00:19:37,971
- Get the paddles.
- AII right, clear.

185
00:19:38,137 --> 00:19:41,599
Temperature and blood pressure
are back to normal.

186
00:19:42,851 --> 00:19:45,228
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr Reston.

187
00:19:45,395 --> 00:19:48,189
- Do you know what your name is?
- What happened?

188
00:19:48,356 --> 00:19:50,859
- Where am I?
- You're in the emergency room.

189
00:19:51,025 --> 00:19:53,862
You were found unconscious.
Do you remember anything?

190
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:55,321
No.

191
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:56,322
Jesus!

192
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:59,784
Can I get some more help over here?
We need some four-by-fours.

193
00:19:59,951 --> 00:20:04,455
We have a very deep laceration here.
Oh, my God, it's gone right through.

194
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:06,541
Miss, you can't go in there.

195
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,918
Doctor, I just need to know what's...

196
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:12,005
She値l be fine.
Please have a seat. Thank you.

197
00:20:13,631 --> 00:20:17,177
These are puncture wounds
caused by the entry of a sharp object.

198
00:20:17,343 --> 00:20:18,803
Are you in any pain?

199
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:21,264
No. That's weird, isn't it?

200
00:20:21,431 --> 00:20:24,851
Wow, will you look at that!
It only bleeds when I touch it.

201
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:27,061
Maybe you should not touch it.

202
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:29,898
Both wounds are identical.
The same size, same shape.

203
00:20:30,064 --> 00:20:32,817
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimetre.

204
00:20:32,984 --> 00:20:35,069
You keep saying ''she''. I didn't do this.

205
00:20:36,821 --> 00:20:41,492
What's happening in your life, Frankie?
Do you have a lot of stress at work?

206
00:20:41,659 --> 00:20:43,620
I cut hair.

207
00:20:43,786 --> 00:20:46,164
Any trouble with a significant other?

208
00:20:46,331 --> 00:20:48,458
- Yes.
- And that is?

209
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,752
I'm not very significant.

210
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:53,588
Look, how long's this gonna take?
I wanna go home.

211
00:20:53,713 --> 00:20:56,883
You should stay here.
We need to get a handle on this.

212
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,219
There's nothing to get a handle on.

213
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:03,890
I won't kid you. With wounds like this,
it's obvious they were self-inflicted.

214
00:21:04,057 --> 00:21:06,142
You think I did this?

215
00:21:07,936 --> 00:21:09,854
It would never happen.

216
00:21:10,021 --> 00:21:13,691
I love being me. Ask anyone.

217
00:21:29,624 --> 00:21:31,626
Frankie,

218
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:34,587
turn the light off, honey,
and come to bed.

219
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,390
Do you smell flowers
in here or something?

220
00:21:45,765 --> 00:21:47,767
No.

221
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:51,729
Smells like jasmine
or hyacinth or something.

222
00:21:53,773 --> 00:21:55,775
I don't smell anything.

223
00:21:58,361 --> 00:22:00,363
You need anything?

224
00:22:00,864 --> 00:22:02,448
No.

225
00:22:02,699 --> 00:22:04,367
Good night.

226
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,202
Good night.

227
00:22:23,845 --> 00:22:27,557
- I'm here to see Brother Delmonico.
- You've got to sign in.

228
00:22:27,724 --> 00:22:31,394
- I値l only be five minutes.
- Everyone has to sign in.

229
00:22:35,481 --> 00:22:37,483
Duty-free.

230
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,487
- Welcome back, Andrew.
- Gianni, come stai?

231
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:44,574
God is good.

232
00:22:44,741 --> 00:22:46,701
So how was Belo Quinto?

233
00:22:46,868 --> 00:22:50,079
How do you know about Belo Quinto?
I was sent to Sao Paulo.

234
00:22:50,246 --> 00:22:53,249
- God lives here. We know everything.
- Oh, yes, I forgot.

235
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,709
So how are you doing?

236
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:56,878
I don't know.

237
00:22:57,712 --> 00:22:59,589
I don't know.

238
00:22:59,756 --> 00:23:03,801
I travel round the world
investigating... miracles.

239
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:05,970
And then I disprove them.

240
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:08,389
The real miracle is
anybody believes anything.

241
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:13,394
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- None of us know what we are doing.

242
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:16,231
- So what are you working on?
- I have no idea.

243
00:23:16,356 --> 00:23:19,442
How can you translate something
if you've no idea?

244
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:23,446
I'm a linguist.
I translate words, not their relevance.

245
00:23:23,613 --> 00:23:27,492
- But this one is a second-century gospel.
- How many is that now?

246
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:30,495
I've helped translate about 1 5.

247
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,248
That only leaves 20 still to go.

248
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:35,875
So there are... what? 35 gospels?

249
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:41,089
Everyone had a different experience
of Jesus, so they wrote different stories.

250
00:23:41,256 --> 00:23:44,467
AII the gospels,
they are interpretations,

251
00:23:44,634 --> 00:23:46,386
memories,

252
00:23:46,553 --> 00:23:48,596
dreams, reflections.

253
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:52,433
And there's no one gospel
in Jesus' actual words?

254
00:23:53,393 --> 00:23:55,478
We're all blind men in a cave,

255
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:59,023
Looking for the candle
that was lit 2,000 years ago.

256
00:23:59,190 --> 00:24:01,276
So what's in this text?

257
00:24:01,442 --> 00:24:03,444
I was only given every third page.

258
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:06,656
- Why?
- The most sensitive documents

259
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:09,534
are always divided into threes among us.

260
00:24:09,701 --> 00:24:12,912
One third to the Dominicans,
one third to the Franciscans,

261
00:24:13,079 --> 00:24:15,206
and one third to us Jesuits.

262
00:24:15,373 --> 00:24:19,460
The truth of any document
is only known to a very powerful few.

263
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:23,298
That's typical of this place, isn't it?

264
00:24:23,464 --> 00:24:27,594
We live in a highly competitive world,
Andrew.

265
00:24:27,886 --> 00:24:29,888
The Church is no exception.

266
00:24:31,973 --> 00:24:34,475
Nothing ever gets out of here, does it?

267
00:24:34,809 --> 00:24:37,312
Unless, of course, they want it to.

268
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:44,485
Both wounds are identical.
Same size, same shape.

269
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:47,322
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimetre.

270
00:24:47,447 --> 00:24:49,407
You think I did this?

271
00:24:49,574 --> 00:24:52,243
What's happening in your life, Frankie?

272
00:24:59,083 --> 00:25:02,712
- So, Jen, tell us about your date.
- It was with a tax lawyer.

273
00:25:02,879 --> 00:25:04,881
A tax lawyer?

274
00:25:05,048 --> 00:25:07,425
When I met him he seemed cool.

275
00:25:07,592 --> 00:25:09,344
Hey, hi, you guys.

276
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:11,930
- How are you feeling?
- Fine.

277
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,352
Really OK, or just OK?

278
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,563
I'm fine. So how's my day looking?

279
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:23,483
I started your first client
and you're booked solid.

280
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:26,361
Thanks. Wanna come over here?

281
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,197
OK, well, go back to Jen and dish the dirt.

282
00:25:30,907 --> 00:25:32,200
So,

283
00:25:32,367 --> 00:25:34,369
he seemed pretty cool.

284
00:25:34,536 --> 00:25:36,538
Divorced, but no kids.

285
00:25:37,372 --> 00:25:42,710
But he left the table in the middle of
dinner to call his mother in Oregon.

286
00:25:42,836 --> 00:25:45,004
Major points for the long-distance mom.

287
00:25:45,171 --> 00:25:48,132
Yeah. You know,
I thought I'd give him a shot,

288
00:25:48,299 --> 00:25:51,261
but you won't believe what he did.

289
00:25:51,427 --> 00:25:55,557
Every single time he took
a bite of his steak,

290
00:25:55,723 --> 00:25:58,142
he growled. He growled!

291
00:26:53,031 --> 00:26:54,324
Shit!

292
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,868
Stop! There's a baby!

293
00:26:58,536 --> 00:26:59,329
Stop!

294
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:00,788
Wait!

295
00:27:00,955 --> 00:27:02,999
There's a baby!

296
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:06,544
Frankie, what are you doing!

297
00:27:09,589 --> 00:27:11,299
Where's the baby?!

298
00:27:11,466 --> 00:27:13,510
Watch it, lady!

299
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:16,846
- Frankie!
- Where's the lady! Did you see her!

300
00:27:17,013 --> 00:27:18,681
She dropped her baby!

301
00:27:18,848 --> 00:27:24,020
Frankie, there was no baby, honey.
There's no baby and there's no lady.

302
00:27:24,187 --> 00:27:26,731
- What's happening?
- No, honey, it's...

303
00:27:31,736 --> 00:27:33,821
There was a lady. I saw her!

304
00:27:33,988 --> 00:27:36,699
- There was not a lady.
- She dropped her baby!

305
00:27:36,866 --> 00:27:38,868
I swear... I swear!

306
00:27:39,744 --> 00:27:41,955
I just wanna get you home, OK?

307
00:27:54,217 --> 00:27:56,219
You all right?

308
00:27:57,595 --> 00:27:59,597
We値l be home in a minute.

309
00:28:46,436 --> 00:28:47,979
- Frankie...
- Hey, you!

310
00:28:48,146 --> 00:28:51,107
- Are you speaking to me?
- Are you Andrew Kiernan?

311
00:28:51,274 --> 00:28:54,235
Andrew Kiernan? No.
My name's Father Durning.

312
00:28:58,489 --> 00:28:59,866
May I help you?

313
00:29:00,033 --> 00:29:02,785
No-one can help me now. I'm fucked.

314
00:30:29,706 --> 00:30:32,834
Passengers please exit the train.

315
00:30:33,668 --> 00:30:35,670
Somebody help!

316
00:30:57,817 --> 00:31:00,528
Frankie Paige?

317
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:03,156
We're gonna schedule some more tests

318
00:31:03,323 --> 00:31:07,452
- for this afternoon around four.
- Did you run a pregnancy test?

319
00:31:07,619 --> 00:31:09,370
Yes.

320
00:31:09,537 --> 00:31:12,040
Am I pregnant?

321
00:31:12,207 --> 00:31:13,625
No.

322
00:31:13,791 --> 00:31:17,420
- Was I?
- I don't know.

323
00:31:42,362 --> 00:31:46,699
Take this, all of you, and drink from it,
for this is the cup of my blood,

324
00:31:46,866 --> 00:31:50,578
shed for you, and for all men,
so that sins may be forgiven.

325
00:31:50,745 --> 00:31:53,414
Do this in memory of me.

326
00:31:54,290 --> 00:31:56,292
This is the blood of Christ.

327
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,092
This is the blood of Christ.

328
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,142
This is the blood of Christ.

329
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:40,170
Well, am I psychotic, or dying, or both?

330
00:32:40,336 --> 00:32:42,630
Well, none of the above.

331
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:45,967
Actually,
I think that you are quite rational,

332
00:32:46,134 --> 00:32:49,429
and despite your wounds
you're in very good health.

333
00:32:49,596 --> 00:32:53,725
But there is another possibility
that is of concern.

334
00:32:53,892 --> 00:32:55,143
Epilepsy.

335
00:32:56,102 --> 00:32:57,478
Epilepsy?

336
00:32:58,188 --> 00:33:00,565
We've run some preliminary tests,

337
00:33:00,732 --> 00:33:04,777
and, all things considered,
I think it might explain a lot.

338
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:07,155
But that seems impossible.

339
00:33:07,322 --> 00:33:10,200
How can you just wake up one day
and have that?

340
00:33:10,366 --> 00:33:14,787
Well, you can't, but, uh,
you described blunt trauma to the head,

341
00:33:14,954 --> 00:33:17,999
disturbing hallucinations.
You're hearing voices.

342
00:33:18,166 --> 00:33:21,753
- These could all indicate epilepsy.
- So what do we do now?

343
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:26,841
We're gonna insert some electrodes
into the upper neo-cortex.

344
00:33:27,008 --> 00:33:31,554
Wait a minute, wait.
You want to put wires inside my head?

345
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:36,476
Frankie, we're gonna do whatever we can
to find out what's causing this.

346
00:33:36,643 --> 00:33:39,062
You hang in there.

347
00:33:54,911 --> 00:33:56,579
Epilepsy?

348
00:33:56,746 --> 00:34:00,667
- You should get a second opinion.
- Miss Paige?

349
00:34:00,834 --> 00:34:02,252
I'm Father Durning.

350
00:34:02,418 --> 00:34:04,420
You spoke to me on the train.

351
00:34:06,089 --> 00:34:08,925
- I'd like to talk about what happened.
- Why?

352
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:11,761
Do you know what the stigmata are?

353
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:14,806
Father,
I gotta get Frankie home. Thanks.

354
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:19,143
I understand how you feel, but please
call me if you change your mind.

355
00:34:24,524 --> 00:34:27,193
Andrew, come in.

356
00:34:27,318 --> 00:34:29,821
I think we've found your next assignment.

357
00:34:29,988 --> 00:34:33,616
I was hoping you'd changed your mind
about sending me to Belo Quinto.

358
00:34:33,783 --> 00:34:36,661
We have no record
of a church in Belo Quinto.

359
00:34:37,662 --> 00:34:41,040
What? That's impossible.
There must be some mistake.

360
00:34:41,207 --> 00:34:44,377
No mistake, Father.
I have checked into it myself.

361
00:34:45,003 --> 00:34:48,756
If there is a church in Belo Quinto,
it is not one of ours.

362
00:34:48,923 --> 00:34:51,176
And no record of a priest there, either.

363
00:34:51,342 --> 00:34:56,014
This was sent by a Father Durning in
Pittsburgh, from the train security camera.

364
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:59,434
What are we supposed to be looking for?

365
00:34:59,601 --> 00:35:00,768
Watch.

366
00:35:02,604 --> 00:35:03,563
Stop.

367
00:35:06,566 --> 00:35:08,985
Obviously it is some sort of attack.

368
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:12,488
Maybe possession.
The wrists are bandaged.

369
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:16,159
According to Father Durning,
she was whipped repeatedly

370
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:18,578
by an unseen force.

371
00:35:18,745 --> 00:35:22,540
- How important is this really, Daniel?
- We don't know yet.

372
00:35:22,707 --> 00:35:25,001
Then why are you sending me?

373
00:35:25,168 --> 00:35:28,505
Because of this clipping
from the Pittsburgh Globe.

374
00:35:30,256 --> 00:35:33,301
''Twenty terrified witnesses...
unexplained wounds...

375
00:35:33,468 --> 00:35:36,387
..Catholic priest.''
The publicity is unfortunate,

376
00:35:36,554 --> 00:35:39,140
but by the time I get there
it will have blown over.

377
00:35:39,307 --> 00:35:41,309
We're investigating this one.

378
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,541
You know what I heard?

379
00:36:04,707 --> 00:36:08,461
Catholic priest in the paper said
that it was something like...

380
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:11,923
- Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

381
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:14,092
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

382
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:17,011
Hey, I feel like I should do a monologue.

383
00:36:18,513 --> 00:36:22,767
Hey, Cheryl. Come on over here
and have a seat. I値l just be a second.

384
00:36:22,934 --> 00:36:26,563
You know what?
I think I'm just gonna wait for Donna.

385
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,732
Oh. OK.

386
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:40,785
- What's going on with her?
- She wants to get a second opinion.

387
00:36:40,952 --> 00:36:44,330
- They think she might have epilepsy.
- Epilepsy?

388
00:36:44,497 --> 00:36:47,417
She doesn't look too good.

389
00:36:47,584 --> 00:36:51,629
- Why is she even at work?
- Hey! Would you guys stop whispering

390
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:54,090
Like this was a goddamn church!

391
00:37:00,263 --> 00:37:02,223
- Hi.
- Hello.

392
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,392
Do you have an appointment, or...

393
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,269
No, I don't.

394
00:37:06,436 --> 00:37:11,524
Would you like a haircut, a manicure,
or maybe you'd like your nipples pierced?

395
00:37:14,277 --> 00:37:18,156
Well, maybe if we just start with a trim,
we could go from there.

396
00:37:19,032 --> 00:37:21,576
- Thank you.
- Come on. Have a seat.

397
00:37:24,245 --> 00:37:28,082
Here we go. I値l put this cape on
so you don't get a scratchy neck.

398
00:37:28,249 --> 00:37:29,417
Thank you.

399
00:37:31,794 --> 00:37:33,296
So, where are you from?

400
00:37:33,463 --> 00:37:35,173
I live in Rome, actually.

401
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,884
- Cool.
- And you?

402
00:37:38,051 --> 00:37:41,095
- I'm from Naples.
- Naples.

403
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:44,849
Naples, la citta piu bella del mondo.

404
00:37:45,016 --> 00:37:48,728
Naples, Florida.
I moved here to go to school.

405
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:50,897
Which school?

406
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:55,318
Claudia's University of Cosmetology.
See, I'm accredited.

407
00:37:55,485 --> 00:37:57,862
Oh. Cool.

408
00:37:59,781 --> 00:38:02,742
Am I going crazy,
or is Frankie hitting on a priest?

409
00:38:02,909 --> 00:38:06,913
What do I call you? I feel weird
calling a guy I could date ''Father''.

410
00:38:08,122 --> 00:38:11,501
I mean, I couldn't date you,
but... you know.

411
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:14,212
Oh, no, you just made my day.

412
00:38:14,379 --> 00:38:17,715
Thank you. You can call me Andrew.

413
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:20,009
Andrew Kiernan, that's my name.

414
00:38:24,764 --> 00:38:26,808
Donna.

415
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:36,234
I know this is gonna sound
kinda strange, but

416
00:38:36,401 --> 00:38:38,820
I've sorta been expecting you.

417
00:38:45,076 --> 00:38:49,372
- So, you live in Rome?
- Yes, but I travel a lot, so I'm rarely there.

418
00:38:49,539 --> 00:38:51,332
- Thank you.
- Coffee, honey?

419
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:54,586
No, thanks.
So what brings you to Pennsylvania?

420
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:57,589
Father Durning asked us
to speak to you, Miss Paige.

421
00:38:57,755 --> 00:38:59,966
Us? Who's us?
I thought you were a priest.

422
00:39:00,133 --> 00:39:04,220
I am, but I'm also an investigator.
I work for a division in the Vatican

423
00:39:04,387 --> 00:39:07,557
called the Congregation for
the Causes of the Saints.

424
00:39:09,058 --> 00:39:12,437
- Do you mind if I switch this on?
- No, go ahead.

425
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:15,064
What is... What is your full name?

426
00:39:15,231 --> 00:39:17,233
Frankie Paige.

427
00:39:17,775 --> 00:39:20,111
- And your age?
- 23.

428
00:39:20,278 --> 00:39:23,907
- And... which church do you attend?
- I don't attend church.

429
00:39:24,073 --> 00:39:26,075
But you are Catholic?

430
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:30,038
No, I don't go to church
because I don't believe in God.

431
00:39:33,249 --> 00:39:38,254
Well... that's gonna be it for me.
That's all I need to know, Miss Paige.

432
00:39:38,421 --> 00:39:40,131
That's it?

433
00:39:40,298 --> 00:39:41,758
Yes.

434
00:39:41,925 --> 00:39:45,178
You see, stigmatics are
deeply religious people.

435
00:39:45,345 --> 00:39:47,263
And there's no exceptions?

436
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:50,642
- No.
- Well, why do they get stigmata?

437
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:54,145
When Christ died on the cross
he... he died with

438
00:39:54,312 --> 00:39:55,855
five wounds.

439
00:39:56,022 --> 00:39:58,066
His back was scourged by whips.

440
00:39:58,233 --> 00:40:01,945
There were gashes in his forehead
from a crown of thorns.

441
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:05,156
There were nails driven through
his hands and feet.

442
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:08,660
And finally a spear

443
00:40:08,826 --> 00:40:11,538
driven through his side.

444
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:14,165
Throughout history

445
00:40:14,332 --> 00:40:18,586
only deeply devout people have been

446
00:40:18,753 --> 00:40:20,755
afflicted with these wounds.

447
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:22,423
Why?

448
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:25,051
There is no scientific explanation.

449
00:40:25,218 --> 00:40:29,097
AII stigmatics are haunted
by such intense spiritual pain.

450
00:40:29,264 --> 00:40:34,018
In some ways it affects them physically.
They're assaulted by visions of evil,

451
00:40:34,185 --> 00:40:36,980
and they manifest this battle
in their bodies.

452
00:40:37,146 --> 00:40:40,316
The Church, on the other hand,
regards it as a gift.

453
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:41,818
A gift from God.

454
00:40:41,985 --> 00:40:45,113
A gift? Can I give it back?

455
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:54,038
Listen, Father, can I show you these
and you could tell me what you think?

456
00:40:55,415 --> 00:40:57,333
Yes. Yes, of course.

457
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:29,449
Coffee, honey?

458
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,578
Well, what do you think?

459
00:41:33,745 --> 00:41:37,332
- It doesn't really matter what I think.
- What does that mean?

460
00:41:37,498 --> 00:41:40,210
It means officially
this is not a case for the Church.

461
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:45,840
To say that a self-confessed atheist
exhibits the wounds of Christ

462
00:41:46,007 --> 00:41:48,092
- is a contradiction in terms.
- Here.

463
00:41:48,259 --> 00:41:51,638
Read that. I found that on my kitchen
table the other morning.

464
00:41:51,804 --> 00:41:55,141
Now, I don't know what that says,
but that handwriting is mine.

465
00:41:55,308 --> 00:41:56,851
It's Italian.

466
00:41:57,018 --> 00:42:01,272
It says, ''Split a piece of wood
and I'm there.''

467
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:04,484
''Lift a stone and you will find me.''

468
00:42:04,651 --> 00:42:08,112
- It's quite beautiful, actually.
- This isn't beautiful!

469
00:42:08,279 --> 00:42:11,032
This is a warning!
It means no matter what I do,...

470
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:13,284
- Miss Paige...
- ..I can't escape it.

471
00:42:13,451 --> 00:42:17,497
- Miss Paige, I would really like to help...
- You know what?

472
00:42:17,664 --> 00:42:20,708
This is not going anywhere.
You don't know what this is.

473
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:23,878
You can't give me an answer.
Coffee's on me. Here.

474
00:42:53,533 --> 00:42:57,537
There is no scientific explanation.

475
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:04,502
Stigmatics are deeply religious people.

476
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,256
We're gonna do whatever we can

477
00:43:08,423 --> 00:43:13,136
to find out, but, all things considered,
I think it might explain a lot.

478
00:43:13,303 --> 00:43:17,974
Throughout history,
only people who believe deeply in God

479
00:43:18,141 --> 00:43:21,352
have been afflicted with these wounds.
The nearer they come to God,

480
00:43:21,519 --> 00:43:24,272
the more open they are
to the torment of their demons.

481
00:43:25,732 --> 00:43:27,859
The Church regards it as a gift.

482
00:43:28,026 --> 00:43:29,861
A gift from God.

483
00:43:40,747 --> 00:43:44,167
- Here's to Friday night.
- Yeah. To Friday night, honey.

484
00:43:48,421 --> 00:43:49,839
Frankie!

485
00:43:51,758 --> 00:43:56,262
Don't worry. Order another drink.
I値l be right back. I'm gonna check it out.

486
00:43:56,429 --> 00:43:57,847
 But you just can't tell

487
00:43:58,014 --> 00:44:00,517
 Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

488
00:44:00,683 --> 00:44:02,602
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hey.

489
00:44:02,769 --> 00:44:06,064
- What's up? I thought you were resting.
- Have you seen Steven?

490
00:44:06,231 --> 00:44:09,108
Forget about Steven.
What's up with that priest?

491
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:11,236
Believe me, he's all business.

492
00:44:11,402 --> 00:44:13,571
Hey, can we get two doubles each?

493
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:16,783
Hey, you know what's scarier
than not believing in God?

494
00:44:16,950 --> 00:44:18,284
Believing in him.

495
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:22,330
I mean really believing in him
is a fucking terrifying thought.

496
00:44:22,497 --> 00:44:25,250
It's Friday night.
You're taking things too seriously.

497
00:44:25,416 --> 00:44:28,586
If there is a God, he hates me.
He's ruining my life.

498
00:44:28,753 --> 00:44:31,214
Frankie, it's gonna be all right. Man, relax.

499
00:44:31,381 --> 00:44:34,843
You don't get it, do you?
I have fucking holes through my wrists!

500
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:37,470
I have slashes across my back!

501
00:44:37,637 --> 00:44:40,807
If it isn't God that's doing this to me,
then who is?

502
00:44:42,225 --> 00:44:44,310
I think you're losing it, man.

503
00:44:47,272 --> 00:44:49,274
Where you goin'?

504
00:44:50,608 --> 00:44:51,818
Frankie!

505
00:45:01,744 --> 00:45:02,579
Frankie!

506
00:45:04,455 --> 00:45:06,082
Frankie, get up!

507
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:08,418
Get up! Frankie!

508
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:20,847
Don't just fuckin' stand there!
Call an ambulance!

509
00:45:21,014 --> 00:45:21,848
Damn.

510
00:45:33,568 --> 00:45:35,737
Frankie, where are you?!

511
00:45:49,792 --> 00:45:51,419
Get out of there!

512
00:46:16,778 --> 00:46:18,905
Miss Paige?

513
00:48:19,275 --> 00:48:20,860
Frankie!

514
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:37,794
- Let's get you outta here.
- Frankie.

515
00:48:37,961 --> 00:48:43,633
- We need to get her to a safe place.
- Here, I got you. I got you.

516
00:49:18,918 --> 00:49:22,088
- Welcome back.
- Where am I?

517
00:49:22,255 --> 00:49:24,716
You're in Father Durning's church.

518
00:49:27,135 --> 00:49:28,511
Here.

519
00:49:28,678 --> 00:49:30,680
I think she should get some rest.

520
00:49:31,347 --> 00:49:33,558
You all right?

521
00:49:38,229 --> 00:49:40,481
You look like shit.

522
00:49:40,648 --> 00:49:42,650
It smells like...

523
00:49:44,235 --> 00:49:45,486
flowers.

524
00:49:46,446 --> 00:49:49,115
You've got stuff all in your hair.

525
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:13,139
Pronto.

526
00:50:13,306 --> 00:50:15,975
- Gianni, come stai?
- Andrew, how are you?

527
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:17,310
Gianni, listen...

528
00:50:17,477 --> 00:50:20,563
- Could you translate something?
- Si. Do you have it there?

529
00:50:20,730 --> 00:50:22,982
Yes, I have it here. I値l play it.

530
00:50:33,952 --> 00:50:35,411
Thama...

531
00:50:35,578 --> 00:50:39,999
- Well, what is it? Is it gibberish?
- No, it's not gibberish at all.

532
00:50:40,166 --> 00:50:41,960
Who is speaking?

533
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:56,034
- Morning, Miss Paige. You're up early.
- Hey, I think you made a mistake.

534
00:51:56,201 --> 00:51:58,661
- What do you mean?
- I can't have stigmata.

535
00:51:58,828 --> 00:52:02,540
Jesus was crucified through
the palms of his hands, not his wrists.

536
00:52:02,707 --> 00:52:05,710
My wounds are through the wrists.
So you're wrong.

537
00:52:05,877 --> 00:52:10,965
Actually, scientists have discovered that
in Roman times people were crucified

538
00:52:11,132 --> 00:52:13,426
through the wrists, not the palms.

539
00:52:13,593 --> 00:52:16,095
The hands couldn't support
the body weight,

540
00:52:16,262 --> 00:52:18,598
so they did crucify them
through the wrists.

541
00:52:18,765 --> 00:52:23,478
No, wait, you're telling me
that every painting,

542
00:52:23,645 --> 00:52:25,730
every statue of Christ,

543
00:52:25,897 --> 00:52:28,858
every single crucifix
in the whole world is wrong?

544
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:33,571
No, no, just inaccurate.
They're impressions of the truth.

545
00:52:33,738 --> 00:52:37,367
Icons are meant to be inspirational.

546
00:52:37,534 --> 00:52:40,745
Miss Paige,
there's something else you should know.

547
00:52:40,912 --> 00:52:44,791
The words you keep repeating
that, uh, you thought were nonsense.

548
00:52:44,958 --> 00:52:46,835
It's not.

549
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:51,089
It's actually a very specific language.
It's a form of Aramaic.

550
00:52:52,173 --> 00:52:53,383
What?

551
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:56,886
It's a form of Aramaic
that hasn't been used for 1900 years.

552
00:52:57,053 --> 00:53:00,431
It's a dialect that was used in Galilee
around the time of Jesus.

553
00:53:42,140 --> 00:53:45,059
Split a piece of wood and I am there.

554
00:53:45,435 --> 00:53:48,271
Lift a stone and you will find me.

555
00:54:43,576 --> 00:54:45,995
- Did you get through?
- No.

556
00:54:46,162 --> 00:54:48,164
Her machine didn't even pick up.

557
00:55:13,189 --> 00:55:15,191
Miss Paige?

558
00:55:49,058 --> 00:55:50,685
Frankie?

559
00:56:25,053 --> 00:56:26,846
Who are you?

560
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:34,354
The messenger is not important.

561
00:58:19,709 --> 00:58:22,962
I feel like my heart is breaking.

562
00:58:26,424 --> 00:58:28,718
Why am I so sad?

563
00:58:36,851 --> 00:58:38,853
It smells like flowers in here.

564
00:58:41,648 --> 00:58:44,526
Like... jasmine or...

565
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,530
..rose or something.

566
00:58:49,197 --> 00:58:51,866
- Can you smell that?
- Yes, I can.

567
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:58,039
- Who wrote that?
- You did.

568
00:58:58,206 --> 00:59:01,209
- I wrote that?!
- Yes.

569
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:17,183
- Have you heard from Father Andrew?
- No, Eminence.

570
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:20,353
- He hasn't filed a report.
- What are these?

571
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:23,898
These are newspaper clippings
from our office in New York.

572
00:59:24,065 --> 00:59:26,317
The first one is from Pennsylvania.

573
00:59:26,484 --> 00:59:29,279
The others are from New York
and Washington.

574
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:33,825
These are even more damaging.
This one mentions the stigmata.

575
00:59:33,992 --> 00:59:38,037
- He isn't defusing the situation.
- Shall I call him home?

576
00:59:38,204 --> 00:59:43,334
Have him conclude his investigation
and report to me in New York next week.

577
00:59:48,006 --> 00:59:51,676
Frankie, can you please come over here
and have a look at this?

578
00:59:51,843 --> 00:59:55,096
I just can't believe that none of this
means anything to you.

579
00:59:59,642 --> 01:00:00,602
Frankie?

580
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:10,820
Frankie, can you please...

581
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,951
Can you please look at this?

582
01:00:17,202 --> 01:00:21,664
Sometimes subjects retain fragments
or images that can be transmitted

583
01:00:21,831 --> 01:00:22,957
subconsciously.

584
01:00:23,124 --> 01:00:27,045
This subject doesn't retain
fragments of images.

585
01:00:27,212 --> 01:00:31,883
You don't get it, do you, Father Kiernan?
I don't know what the hell that means!

586
01:00:32,050 --> 01:00:36,179
I don't know what the hell this means.
I just want my life back, OK?

587
01:00:42,727 --> 01:00:47,065
 I知 sitting amongst yourselves

588
01:00:47,232 --> 01:00:51,402
 Don't think you can see me

589
01:00:52,153 --> 01:00:55,698
 I haven't gone anywhere

590
01:00:56,866 --> 01:01:00,495
 But out of my body

591
01:01:01,829 --> 01:01:05,667
 Reach out and touch me

592
01:01:06,626 --> 01:01:10,588
 Make effort to speak to me

593
01:01:11,422 --> 01:01:15,301
 Call out and you'll hear me

594
01:01:16,219 --> 01:01:19,681
 Be happy for me...

595
01:01:19,848 --> 01:01:21,766
Miss Paige?

596
01:01:21,933 --> 01:01:25,770
Miss Paige, I'm sorry.

597
01:01:25,979 --> 01:01:28,940
Don't ''Miss Paige'' me
just because you messed up.

598
01:01:29,107 --> 01:01:31,401
I'm not gonna let you off the hook.

599
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:34,863
OK, but I am sorry.

600
01:01:35,029 --> 01:01:38,074
You know, for a priest
you're pretty relentless.

601
01:01:38,241 --> 01:01:42,787
Yeah, I guess I stopped being a priest
and slipped back into being a scientist.

602
01:01:42,954 --> 01:01:44,914
It happens.

603
01:01:45,081 --> 01:01:48,168
Hey, what kind of a scientist
is a priest, anyway?

604
01:01:48,334 --> 01:01:50,336
You don't want to know.

605
01:01:50,503 --> 01:01:52,797
Oh, yes, I do!

606
01:01:53,006 --> 01:01:54,841
You were an organic chemist?

607
01:01:55,008 --> 01:01:57,677
Did you walk around
with those glasses

608
01:01:57,802 --> 01:02:01,556
with Scotch tape around the sides,
and pocket protectors?

609
01:02:01,723 --> 01:02:03,933
I did, actually.

610
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:08,438
Anyway, one day I just decided that
I was going to become a priest.

611
01:02:08,605 --> 01:02:09,564
Why?

612
01:02:09,731 --> 01:02:11,983
- The holes.
- The holes?

613
01:02:12,150 --> 01:02:14,527
- The holes in the theories.
- What theories?

614
01:02:14,694 --> 01:02:16,863
The world is six billion years old.

615
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:21,951
There's been life for three billion years,
but before that there was nothing.

616
01:02:22,118 --> 01:02:25,496
No life.
Just a bunch of elements swirling around.

617
01:02:25,663 --> 01:02:28,791
And then one day,
for no apparent reason whatsoever,

618
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:32,003
all these elements
came together in perfect harmony

619
01:02:32,170 --> 01:02:34,130
and there was suddenly life.

620
01:02:34,297 --> 01:02:37,800
Living things like lilac
and... and hedgehogs and...

621
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:39,969
Beer and... cheesecake.

622
01:02:40,136 --> 01:02:43,515
Beer and cheesecake.
Did you know monks invented alcohol?

623
01:02:43,681 --> 01:02:46,351
- Yeah. Everybody knows that.
- You knew that?

624
01:02:46,476 --> 01:02:47,435
Yeah.

625
01:02:47,602 --> 01:02:51,439
Well, anyway, to get back to the big hole.
There really...

626
01:02:51,606 --> 01:02:53,942
There really isn't any explanation.

627
01:02:54,567 --> 01:02:57,570
And, I figured that
there was something more than

628
01:02:57,737 --> 01:03:00,865
well, more important than
organic chemistry going on,

629
01:03:01,032 --> 01:03:03,243
and I figured that... it was God.

630
01:03:03,409 --> 01:03:07,038
And that God was responsible
for all this... Life.

631
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:10,625
- I really can't get a line on you.
- Why not?

632
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:15,255
- I can't understand a man who's never...
- Never made love to a woman?

633
01:03:15,421 --> 01:03:19,133
Well, this may come
as a great surprise to you, but

634
01:03:19,425 --> 01:03:21,553
I wasn't born a priest.

635
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:25,306
- You didn't like it?
- What's not to like?

636
01:03:25,473 --> 01:03:28,643
- But you don't miss it?
- Yes, of course I miss it.

637
01:03:28,810 --> 01:03:31,396
I mean, I'm human, you know.

638
01:03:31,563 --> 01:03:37,026
I struggle with it, but I've made a choice.
Basically, I've exchanged

639
01:03:37,193 --> 01:03:40,238
one set of complications for another.

640
01:04:53,019 --> 01:04:55,188
So this is the fourth?

641
01:04:55,355 --> 01:04:58,024
- What do you mean?
- When I first met you,

642
01:04:58,149 --> 01:05:01,194
didn't you say that
there were five wounds?

643
01:05:01,361 --> 01:05:04,739
Well, this is the fourth. What's the fifth?

644
01:05:06,616 --> 01:05:08,618
The spear.

645
01:05:09,118 --> 01:05:11,287
That's the wound that killed him.

646
01:05:11,454 --> 01:05:13,456
Don't worry, Frankie.

647
01:05:13,623 --> 01:05:17,001
No stigmatic has ever received
the full five wounds.

648
01:05:17,168 --> 01:05:20,547
Have you ever met another person
who had stigmata?

649
01:05:20,713 --> 01:05:25,552
I did make a pilgrimage to a small village
in the mountains of southern Italy.

650
01:05:25,718 --> 01:05:28,012
There I met a priest called Padre Pio.

651
01:05:28,179 --> 01:05:31,391
He first received the wounds
when he was 23 years of age,

652
01:05:31,558 --> 01:05:34,269
the same age as Saint Francis of Assisi.

653
01:05:34,435 --> 01:05:36,437
Who's Saint Francis of Assisi?

654
01:05:36,604 --> 01:05:41,943
Saint Francis was the first person
to receive the stigmata, in the 1 3thC.

655
01:05:42,068 --> 01:05:45,446
He was a wild young man,
who suddenly changed his ways

656
01:05:45,613 --> 01:05:49,617
after he'd had a vision
of being crucified alongside Christ.

657
01:05:49,784 --> 01:05:54,873
When he woke up, his hands
and his feet were... were bleeding.

658
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:58,168
This priest,
were his wounds as bad as mine?

659
01:05:58,334 --> 01:05:59,919
Padre Pio.

660
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:05,216
Sometimes he lost a pint of blood a day.
And he suffered terrible demonic attacks.

661
01:06:05,383 --> 01:06:06,426
A priest?

662
01:06:06,593 --> 01:06:10,930
AII stigmatics suffer
the most intense spiritual conflict.

663
01:06:11,097 --> 01:06:13,057
The nearer they come to God,

664
01:06:13,224 --> 01:06:17,020
the more open they are to temptation,
to evil visions,

665
01:06:17,395 --> 01:06:20,231
to the torment of their demons.

666
01:06:20,398 --> 01:06:25,320
A smell accompanies the wounds.
The odour of sanctity, the smell of...

667
01:06:25,486 --> 01:06:26,446
Flowers?

668
01:06:26,613 --> 01:06:28,198
Yes.

669
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:30,116
Flowers.

670
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:33,661
Well, what happened to him?

671
01:06:33,828 --> 01:06:36,247
How many wounds did he receive?

672
01:06:36,414 --> 01:06:38,416
He...

673
01:06:38,917 --> 01:06:41,461
He lived to old age.

674
01:06:41,628 --> 01:06:44,297
How many wounds did he receive?

675
01:06:48,051 --> 01:06:49,260
Two.

676
01:06:56,017 --> 01:06:58,019
I'm dying, aren't I?

677
01:07:00,939 --> 01:07:03,024
This thing is killing me.

678
01:07:26,506 --> 01:07:28,424
Here's a closer shot.

679
01:07:28,591 --> 01:07:30,844
My guess is it's probably Aramaic.

680
01:07:31,010 --> 01:07:32,220
Aspetta.

681
01:07:32,387 --> 01:07:34,389
I'm looking at it.

682
01:07:35,223 --> 01:07:37,725
Is there a... Is there a problem, Gianni?

683
01:07:37,892 --> 01:07:40,687
Yes. Don't send me any more pictures.

684
01:07:40,854 --> 01:07:43,189
- How many did you send?
- Six. Why?

685
01:07:43,356 --> 01:07:46,860
- The problem is what it says.
- Well, what does it say?

686
01:07:47,026 --> 01:07:51,489
It says, ''The kingdom of God is
inside you, and all about you.''

687
01:07:51,656 --> 01:07:53,616
Andrew, forget you saw this.

688
01:07:53,783 --> 01:07:57,328
- Drop it immediately.
- Gianni, what is the problem?

689
01:07:57,495 --> 01:08:00,290
Do you remember the Gospels...

690
01:08:01,791 --> 01:08:05,170
Gianni? Gianni, are you still there?

691
01:08:05,336 --> 01:08:07,797
Do you remember
the Gospels Commission?

692
01:08:07,964 --> 01:08:11,342
It was closed down suddenly
by your friend Cardinal Houseman.

693
01:08:11,509 --> 01:08:13,386
Yes, a few years ago, yes.

694
01:08:13,553 --> 01:08:17,140
We discovered a document that
looked like a completely new gospel.

695
01:08:17,307 --> 01:08:20,059
- What's the significance?
- I was one of the three

696
01:08:20,226 --> 01:08:24,689
translators of this gospel.
It was written entirely in Aramaic.

697
01:08:25,190 --> 01:08:28,151
The language of Jesus and his disciples.

698
01:08:28,318 --> 01:08:30,403
It may be Jesus's actual words.

699
01:08:30,570 --> 01:08:31,696
He's...

700
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:35,992
Where is it now?

701
01:08:36,826 --> 01:08:39,037
Gianni? What's going on?

702
01:08:39,204 --> 01:08:40,830
Are you there?

703
01:08:40,997 --> 01:08:41,789
Gianni?

704
01:08:47,045 --> 01:08:49,047
Buona sera.

705
01:08:52,258 --> 01:08:53,843
What's this?

706
01:08:58,973 --> 01:09:00,975
Is that a painting?

707
01:09:01,142 --> 01:09:03,186
- No, it's a mirror.
- Who else was there?

708
01:09:03,353 --> 01:09:06,606
- I don't know.
- I thought you said it was just you two.

709
01:09:07,315 --> 01:09:09,317
16a. Do you have the neg?

710
01:09:12,070 --> 01:09:14,072
Who is that?

711
01:09:19,494 --> 01:09:21,913
I値l be back as soon as I can.

712
01:09:47,188 --> 01:09:49,774
- Cardinal Houseman.
- I'm late for a meeting.

713
01:09:49,941 --> 01:09:53,027
- I think this might be of interest.
- What is it?

714
01:09:58,408 --> 01:10:02,495
- Where did you get this?
- It was e-mailed to Father Delmonico.

715
01:10:02,662 --> 01:10:05,748
- By who?
- Father Kiernan in Pittsburgh.

716
01:10:07,000 --> 01:10:09,085
- Do you know what it means?
- No.

717
01:10:09,252 --> 01:10:11,337
Is it important?

718
01:10:11,504 --> 01:10:15,300
Will you tell the meeting
I値l be with them in a few minutes?

719
01:10:20,263 --> 01:10:21,890
New York City

720
01:10:24,267 --> 01:10:25,727
Who is it?

721
01:10:25,894 --> 01:10:28,271
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

722
01:10:28,438 --> 01:10:29,814
Who's this?

723
01:10:29,981 --> 01:10:31,482
It's an old friend.

724
01:10:31,649 --> 01:10:35,945
- Delmonico? What's happened?
- The missing Jesus gospel... It turned up.

725
01:10:36,112 --> 01:10:37,488
That's impossible.

726
01:10:37,655 --> 01:10:38,489
Alameida...

727
01:10:38,656 --> 01:10:39,991
Alameida?

728
01:10:40,158 --> 01:10:42,243
In the United States. Pittsburgh.

729
01:10:42,410 --> 01:10:43,620
Send me something.

730
01:10:43,786 --> 01:10:45,788
No. No, I can't.

731
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:47,957
Houseman will kill me.

732
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:10,563
Hi, come in. The door's open.

733
01:11:18,238 --> 01:11:19,489
Frankie?

734
01:11:19,656 --> 01:11:21,658
I'm in here!

735
01:11:27,455 --> 01:11:30,124
How you doin'? Want a beer?

736
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:31,918
Sure.

737
01:11:36,923 --> 01:11:41,511
- Check these out. They're getting better.
- That's great.

738
01:11:42,971 --> 01:11:44,180
Really good.

739
01:11:44,347 --> 01:11:47,141
You値l be able to get
these stitches out soon.

740
01:11:47,308 --> 01:11:49,310
That's great.

741
01:11:49,477 --> 01:11:51,479
Let me see your forehead.

742
01:11:53,731 --> 01:11:56,484
- Does this... Does this hurt?
- No.

743
01:11:58,111 --> 01:11:59,821
Great. You'll...

744
01:12:25,096 --> 01:12:27,140
Why did you paint over the wall?

745
01:12:27,307 --> 01:12:30,268
I got bored, and I got sick
of looking at that thing.

746
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:12,227
I really wish you weren't wearing
that uniform right now.

747
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:14,771
It's got nothing to do with the uniform.

748
01:13:14,938 --> 01:13:18,191
Well, what is it? You took a vow
to be dead from the neck down?

749
01:13:20,318 --> 01:13:21,986
Come on!

750
01:13:22,153 --> 01:13:26,658
I've seen the way you look at me.
You know the way that I feel about you.

751
01:13:27,158 --> 01:13:30,036
Come on, I'm not blind. It's OK.

752
01:13:30,203 --> 01:13:31,287
No.

753
01:13:32,121 --> 01:13:35,792
Why, because I...
I painted the wall out? Is that it?

754
01:13:35,959 --> 01:13:38,920
So now I'm no use to you, right? Is that it?

755
01:13:39,087 --> 01:13:41,548
Answer me!

756
01:13:42,507 --> 01:13:47,011
You are so proud of your holy abstinence!

757
01:13:48,429 --> 01:13:50,932
Like touching a woman would kill you!

758
01:13:51,099 --> 01:13:54,269
Women are dirty little complications!

759
01:13:57,355 --> 01:13:59,357
That's why you became a priest.

760
01:13:59,524 --> 01:14:03,403
It has nothing to do
with your convenient little stories!

761
01:14:08,783 --> 01:14:11,911
Oh, you're so proud of your church,

762
01:14:12,078 --> 01:14:14,873
of virgins and eunuchs!

763
01:14:45,111 --> 01:14:48,865
How's your faith these days, Father?

764
01:14:49,032 --> 01:14:51,451
How's your faith these days?!

765
01:14:51,618 --> 01:14:54,495
This is what you fucking call God?

766
01:14:58,082 --> 01:14:59,918
Blood of Christ!

767
01:18:15,989 --> 01:18:20,577
- I've never seen you pray before.
- I haven't prayed for a very long time.

768
01:18:22,829 --> 01:18:24,622
Come here.

769
01:18:26,666 --> 01:18:29,085
It's OK. Come on.

770
01:19:32,982 --> 01:19:34,984
Go in.

771
01:19:49,165 --> 01:19:52,418
- Daniel.
- We've come to help.

772
01:19:53,711 --> 01:19:56,089
Take her to the archdiocese.

773
01:20:15,942 --> 01:20:18,862
I値l be downstairs if you need me, Sister.

774
01:20:24,617 --> 01:20:27,620
Where did you get this from, hm?
What does it mean?

775
01:20:27,787 --> 01:20:30,665
The girl wrote it.
I don't know what it means.

776
01:20:30,832 --> 01:20:32,834
Neither does she.

777
01:20:33,042 --> 01:20:35,003
Why was it painted over?

778
01:20:35,170 --> 01:20:38,590
- What language is it in?
- It's Aramaic.

779
01:20:38,756 --> 01:20:41,217
How do you know that?

780
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:43,887
- That's irrelevant.
- What I don't understand

781
01:20:44,053 --> 01:20:47,390
is why you would send this
to anyone other than me.

782
01:20:47,557 --> 01:20:50,018
- What are you hiding?
- AII I know is

783
01:20:50,185 --> 01:20:52,562
that the girl is fighting for her life.

784
01:20:52,729 --> 01:20:56,774
If she receives another wound
she's going to die unless we help her.

785
01:20:56,941 --> 01:20:58,902
Right. I'm taking over.

786
01:20:59,068 --> 01:21:01,446
- Get some rest.
- I'm not leaving her alone.

787
01:21:01,613 --> 01:21:04,115
You're leaving her
in the care of the sisters.

788
01:21:04,282 --> 01:21:06,701
You sent me here.
I didn't want to come.

789
01:21:06,868 --> 01:21:09,704
You told me to deal with her.
That's what I'm doing!

790
01:21:09,871 --> 01:21:12,540
She's in no condition
to take on you or the Church.

791
01:21:12,665 --> 01:21:15,835
This is not about a girl
taking on me or taking on the Church!

792
01:21:16,002 --> 01:21:19,756
Why are you more concerned
about photographs than a girl dying?

793
01:21:19,923 --> 01:21:23,593
- Andrew, where's your loyalty?
- Don't you lecture me about loyalty.

794
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:26,888
The only reason
you've been tolerated for so long

795
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:29,432
is because you were a good scientist.

796
01:21:29,599 --> 01:21:32,560
Because of your objectivity.
Well, you've lost that.

797
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:37,398
The last thing I expected to see in
that girl's apartment was the two of you

798
01:21:37,565 --> 01:21:39,776
- Lying on a bed together.
- Oh, come on!

799
01:21:39,943 --> 01:21:43,613
You think you're helping her,
but you're not. She's getting worse.

800
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:48,952
Andrew, you're in no state to help anyone
right now. You're exhausted.

801
01:21:49,118 --> 01:21:52,789
Go to Father Durning's. Get some rest.
We値l talk about it tomorrow.

802
01:21:52,956 --> 01:21:55,875
Why are you so concerned
with these photographs?

803
01:21:56,042 --> 01:21:59,045
Father Delmonico seemed to think
they were important.

804
01:21:59,212 --> 01:22:02,882
- What do they mean?
- We've no idea, but we're working on it.

805
01:22:03,049 --> 01:22:06,886
- Is it to do with the Gospel Commission?
- We don't know.

806
01:22:07,053 --> 01:22:09,055
Good night, Andrew.

807
01:22:39,752 --> 01:22:41,754
Andrew Kiernan?

808
01:22:43,798 --> 01:22:46,301
- I'm Kiernan.
- I want to see Alameida.

809
01:22:46,467 --> 01:22:48,011
I don't know any Alameida.

810
01:22:48,178 --> 01:22:51,764
Delmonico faxed me this copy
of his document.

811
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:54,893
The girl wrote this. I saw her do it.
What is this?

812
01:22:55,059 --> 01:22:59,647
It's maybe the most significant
Christian relic ever found.

813
01:22:59,814 --> 01:23:01,065
Why?

814
01:23:01,232 --> 01:23:04,444
It's an Aramaic scroll
from the first century,

815
01:23:04,611 --> 01:23:09,741
discovered near the caves of the
Dead Sea Scrolls, outside Jerusalem.

816
01:23:09,908 --> 01:23:12,327
Alameida and I concluded that

817
01:23:13,328 --> 01:23:17,040
it is a gospel... of Jesus Christ,

818
01:23:17,207 --> 01:23:20,001
in his own words... Aramaic.

819
01:23:20,168 --> 01:23:24,881
But there are some factions in the Vatican
who believe that this document

820
01:23:25,048 --> 01:23:28,426
could destroy the authority
of the modern Church.

821
01:23:28,593 --> 01:23:30,178
How?

822
01:23:31,596 --> 01:23:35,892
It was Jesus' words to his disciples
on the night of his Last Supper.

823
01:23:36,059 --> 01:23:41,981
His instructions to them on how to
continue his church after his death.

824
01:23:42,148 --> 01:23:44,692
Why would that be so... so threatening?

825
01:23:44,859 --> 01:23:48,613
When we gave our initial conclusions
to the Gospel Commission,

826
01:23:48,780 --> 01:23:51,449
Houseman ordered us
to stop immediately.

827
01:23:51,616 --> 01:23:54,410
Alameida refused.
He stole the document and disappeared.

828
01:23:54,577 --> 01:23:57,247
Houseman excommunicated us
in our absence.

829
01:23:57,413 --> 01:23:59,457
You have no idea where he is?

830
01:23:59,624 --> 01:24:04,170
He doesn't want to be caught
until he finishes the translation.

831
01:24:04,337 --> 01:24:06,506
I値l show you this guy.

832
01:24:06,673 --> 01:24:11,010
That's Delmonico, me and Alameida.
We were all translating the new gospel.

833
01:24:11,177 --> 01:24:14,931
I've seen this man.
Three weeks ago, in Brazil.

834
01:24:15,098 --> 01:24:17,058
- Yeah?
- He's dead.

835
01:24:17,225 --> 01:24:18,601
How do you know this?

836
01:24:18,768 --> 01:24:23,106
Because I saw him in his coffin
in a church in Belo Quinto. I'm sorry.

837
01:24:26,317 --> 01:24:29,654
Then it's all over. It's gone forever.

838
01:24:29,863 --> 01:24:32,448
Why was your work stopped?

839
01:24:32,615 --> 01:24:35,201
What was so threatening
about this gospel?

840
01:24:35,368 --> 01:24:38,997
- Look around you. What do you see?
- I see a church.

841
01:24:39,163 --> 01:24:40,707
It's a building.

842
01:24:40,874 --> 01:24:44,586
The true church of Jesus Christ
is so much more.

843
01:24:44,752 --> 01:24:47,463
Not in buildings made of wood and stone.

844
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:49,382
I love Jesus!

845
01:24:49,549 --> 01:24:52,635
I don't need an institution
between him and me.

846
01:24:52,802 --> 01:24:54,929
You see, just God and man.

847
01:24:55,096 --> 01:24:57,223
No priests, no churches.

848
01:24:57,390 --> 01:25:00,602
The first words in Jesus' gospel are,

849
01:25:00,768 --> 01:25:04,397
''The kingdom of God is inside you,

850
01:25:04,564 --> 01:25:07,233
and all around you.''

851
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:10,862
''Not in buildings of wood and stone.''

852
01:25:11,029 --> 01:25:14,115
''Split a piece of wood and I am there.''

853
01:25:14,282 --> 01:25:17,327
- ''Lift a stone and...
- ..you will find me.''

854
01:25:17,493 --> 01:25:19,454
Yes, brother.

855
01:25:22,373 --> 01:25:26,294
Why is Father Alameida wearing gloves?

856
01:25:26,461 --> 01:25:28,379
Alameida was a tormented man.

857
01:25:28,546 --> 01:25:31,216
Holy man. A very holy man.

858
01:25:31,382 --> 01:25:36,054
He wore the gloves
to cover the marks of the stigmata.

859
01:25:41,351 --> 01:25:43,311
She has the stigmata.

860
01:25:43,478 --> 01:25:45,480
That's why.

861
01:25:48,233 --> 01:25:50,235
She's just his messenger.

862
01:25:50,944 --> 01:25:53,613
Houseman will never let
this gospel get out.

863
01:25:56,032 --> 01:25:58,618
Almighty God,
bless your humble servant,

864
01:25:58,785 --> 01:26:01,621
guide me with your Holy Spirit,
and forgive me

865
01:26:01,788 --> 01:26:05,333
for I have sinned exceedingly
in thought, word and deed.

866
01:26:25,895 --> 01:26:27,897
My sins deserve your punishments

867
01:26:28,064 --> 01:26:31,693
because they have crucified
my loving Saviour, Jesus Christ.

868
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,820
Amen.

869
01:27:04,350 --> 01:27:05,310
Lord,

870
01:27:05,476 --> 01:27:08,438
do not remember our sins,
or those of our forefathers.

871
01:27:08,605 --> 01:27:11,608
- Where's Andrew?
- And do not punish us for our offences.

872
01:27:11,774 --> 01:27:14,444
Lead us not into temptation.

873
01:27:14,611 --> 01:27:17,113
Save this woman, your servant.

874
01:27:17,280 --> 01:27:20,283
Spirit of lust,
by the power of Jesus Christ

875
01:27:20,450 --> 01:27:23,745
I command you, come out of her body
now and for always.

876
01:27:23,912 --> 01:27:25,955
In the name of Jesus Christ
I command you

877
01:27:26,122 --> 01:27:28,291
come out of her body now
and for always.

878
01:27:29,834 --> 01:27:31,044
In the name of Jesus Christ...

879
01:27:31,211 --> 01:27:33,546
You are blind men.

880
01:27:33,713 --> 01:27:35,298
Your eyes are open.

881
01:27:35,465 --> 01:27:37,050
But you see nothing.

882
01:27:38,635 --> 01:27:41,513
Why do you persecute me?!

883
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:44,432
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord!

884
01:27:48,061 --> 01:27:51,481
Lord, hear my prayer!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

885
01:27:51,648 --> 01:27:53,233
Behold

886
01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:54,734
your servant,

887
01:27:54,901 --> 01:27:56,903
dripping with blood!

888
01:28:01,783 --> 01:28:03,868
Embrace me, my child. I am the Church.

889
01:28:04,035 --> 01:28:07,247
You are the true enemy
of the Church, Houseman.

890
01:28:07,830 --> 01:28:08,790
I am the Church.

891
01:28:08,957 --> 01:28:10,959
- Stop!
- Get away from me!

892
01:28:12,710 --> 01:28:15,505
Get them out of here!
Get out of here! Get out!

893
01:28:16,339 --> 01:28:18,675
- Eminenza!
- Get out!

894
01:28:20,552 --> 01:28:22,637
Save this woman from woe. O Lord,

895
01:28:22,804 --> 01:28:25,348
save this woman, your servant.

896
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:32,856
Send her help
from the holy place, O Lord.

897
01:28:33,022 --> 01:28:35,817
Give her heavenly protection.

898
01:28:39,571 --> 01:28:42,949
Save this woman, O Lord!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

899
01:28:48,621 --> 01:28:50,665
Send her help from the holy place.

900
01:28:54,919 --> 01:28:56,045
Frankie!

901
01:28:56,212 --> 01:28:58,923
You will not destroy my Church.

902
01:29:08,183 --> 01:29:09,392
Frankie!

903
01:29:10,602 --> 01:29:12,562
You must not interrupt.

904
01:29:13,438 --> 01:29:16,149
What are you doing?! Get away from her!

905
01:29:16,316 --> 01:29:19,110
- Get away from her!
- No! No!

906
01:29:19,277 --> 01:29:21,279
Get away!

907
01:29:23,156 --> 01:29:25,450
It's all right. I know what...

908
01:29:25,617 --> 01:29:26,993
Andrew!

909
01:29:27,160 --> 01:29:29,370
Get away from her!
You don't know what's going on here!

910
01:29:29,537 --> 01:29:32,207
You get off me! You lied to me!

911
01:29:32,373 --> 01:29:36,127
You tried to silence her.
You lied to me, you bastard!

912
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:39,506
- Andrew...
- You tried to kill her!

913
01:29:40,840 --> 01:29:45,053
I know everything. I know why you
closed down the Gospel Commission,

914
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:48,348
why you had Petrocelli
and Alameida excommunicated,

915
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:51,351
all about the lies
you've been telling for years.

916
01:29:51,518 --> 01:29:53,811
You won't get away with
what you did to her!

917
01:29:53,978 --> 01:29:56,272
I will not let you destroy the Church.

918
01:29:58,650 --> 01:30:02,237
I promise you,
you've spent your last days in the Church.

919
01:30:16,459 --> 01:30:19,128
Are you Paolo Alameida?

920
01:30:26,010 --> 01:30:30,014
Give me your wisdom.
Let me be your messenger.

921
01:30:31,850 --> 01:30:34,394
A messenger believes.

922
01:30:34,561 --> 01:30:36,980
A messenger has faith.
You have only doubt.

923
01:31:00,503 --> 01:31:02,964
Jesus said, ''The kingdom of God

924
01:31:03,131 --> 01:31:06,509
is inside you and all around you,

925
01:31:06,676 --> 01:31:09,596
not in mansions of wood and stone.''

926
01:31:09,762 --> 01:31:12,891
''Split a piece of wood and I am there.''

927
01:31:13,057 --> 01:31:16,477
''Lift a stone... and you will find me.''

928
01:31:20,106 --> 01:31:24,027
Brother Alameida,
I call upon you to release this woman.

929
01:31:24,194 --> 01:31:27,739
Give her grace and let her not
come into the ways of harm.

930
01:31:27,906 --> 01:31:32,118
Through Jesus Christ we have
all been saved. Let us not fear any ill.

931
01:31:32,285 --> 01:31:34,037
Jesus is with us

932
01:31:34,204 --> 01:31:37,957
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
world without end, for ever and ever.

933
01:31:42,212 --> 01:31:44,714
God bless your soul, Brother Alameida.

934
01:31:45,590 --> 01:31:47,091
Go in peace.

935
01:32:51,614 --> 01:32:53,658
Don't go, Frankie.

936
01:33:01,165 --> 01:33:03,001
Stay with me.

937
01:35:03,246 --> 01:35:08,626
Jesus said,
''The kingdom of God is inside you

938
01:35:08,793 --> 01:35:12,380
and all around you...
not in mansions of wood and stone.''

939
01:35:12,547 --> 01:35:16,217
''The kingdom of God
is inside you, and all around you.''

940
01:35:16,384 --> 01:35:18,344
''Not in buildings of wood and stone.''

941
01:35:18,511 --> 01:35:20,847
