1
00:00:24,258 --> 00:00:26,635
BELO QUINTO, SOUTHEAST BRAZIL

2
00:02:26,338 --> 00:02:28,840
- Are you the investigator?
- Yes.

3
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:31,343
Thank God you've come.

4
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,512
Who's in charge here?

5
00:02:33,679 --> 00:02:36,598
Father AIameida was.

6
00:04:12,235 --> 00:04:14,946
Look! How much proof do you need?!

7
00:04:34,883 --> 00:04:37,344
Has the statue been removed
from the church for any reason?

8
00:04:37,511 --> 00:04:40,472
No. The statue onIy started crying
on the day Father AIameida died.

9
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,725
The day the doves came back.

10
00:04:43,892 --> 00:04:46,895
The peopIe of the viIIage Ioved AIameida.

11
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:53,735
The tears of the Mother
are the bIood of Christ.

12
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:03,370
I suggest you cIear the church.
I have to crate the statue up.

13
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:07,791
- Crate it up?
- Yes.

14
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,586
Father AIameida wouId
never have aIIowed that.

15
00:05:34,526 --> 00:05:37,529
Ma'am? This is Father AIameida's
own rosary...

16
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:45,203
- No, Iady, you reaIIy shouIdn't buy that.
- No, I Iike it... How much?

17
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:47,873
You shouIdn't do that!
You're steaIing from the dead!

18
00:05:59,426 --> 00:06:01,511
Hail Mary, full ofgrace,
the Lord is with thee:

19
00:06:01,678 --> 00:06:03,680
Blessed art thou amongst women,
and blessed is the...

20
00:06:13,231 --> 00:06:15,150
No virgin, me

21
00:06:15,317 --> 00:06:16,902
For l have sinned

22
00:06:17,068 --> 00:06:18,737
l sold my soul

23
00:06:18,904 --> 00:06:21,239
For sex and gin

24
00:06:21,406 --> 00:06:23,325
Go call a priest

25
00:06:23,491 --> 00:06:24,951
All meek and mild

26
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,912
And tell him Mary

27
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:28,830
ls no more a child

28
00:06:33,335 --> 00:06:35,212
lt's raining stones

29
00:06:35,378 --> 00:06:37,339
lt's raining bile

30
00:06:37,505 --> 00:06:39,299
From the luxury

31
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,343
Of your denial

32
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,303
l press alarms

33
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,680
Place bets on truth

34
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,059
l'm so up and down

35
00:06:50,018 --> 00:06:52,437
And now l'm growing old

36
00:06:52,604 --> 00:06:54,606
Disgracefully

37
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:58,568
Whatever happened to Mary?

38
00:06:59,653 --> 00:07:02,572
Whatever happened to Mary?

39
00:07:03,782 --> 00:07:06,660
Whatever happened to Mary?

40
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:10,830
Whatever happened to Mary?

41
00:07:11,623 --> 00:07:13,541
Whatever happened to...

42
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,590
l'll spit on floors

43
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:22,551
And do more drugs

44
00:07:22,717 --> 00:07:24,511
Burn every bill

45
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,805
Get drunk on love

46
00:07:26,972 --> 00:07:28,556
Wear next to nothing...

47
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:32,269
Hey, Frankie, sweetheart!

48
00:07:32,435 --> 00:07:34,563
Let's go. I'm trashed.

49
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:37,107
Are you too tired to go home with me?

50
00:07:37,274 --> 00:07:38,984
I'm tired, not dead.

51
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,319
l'll be uncareful

52
00:07:41,486 --> 00:07:42,904
l'll cause such scenes

53
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,823
And l'll never talk

54
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,908
Of used-to-be's

55
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,035
Tattoo my face

56
00:07:49,202 --> 00:07:51,037
l won't go grey

57
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,039
Be a dancing queen

58
00:07:53,206 --> 00:07:55,667
l'm growing old disgracefully

59
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,670
l'm so up and down

60
00:07:59,462 --> 00:08:02,924
And l love what's not allowed

61
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,010
l was lost

62
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:07,178
Now l see

63
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:12,601
And now l'm growing old disgracefully

64
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:14,829
Oh, hi, Mom.

65
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:17,916
How do you do that?
How did you know that was me?

66
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,669
You have the most persistent ring I know.

67
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:24,381
ljust wanted to say hi while
l'm near a phone. How are you?

68
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:25,799
Where are you?

69
00:09:25,965 --> 00:09:28,093
Belo Quinto, near Rio.

70
00:09:28,259 --> 00:09:30,637
Mom, hoId on, I'm getting another caII.

71
00:09:30,804 --> 00:09:31,763
HeIIo?

72
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:34,599
lt's about time. Where you been, baby?

73
00:09:34,766 --> 00:09:37,560
I hate it when you just Ieave.
You couId say goodbye.

74
00:09:37,727 --> 00:09:38,687
Why?

75
00:09:38,853 --> 00:09:41,147
''Why?'' Forget it.

76
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,984
Look, I got my mom on the other Iine.
I'II see you tonight.

77
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,153
AII right, I'II see you Iater.

78
00:09:47,362 --> 00:09:50,490
Mom? Hi, I'm back.
So how do you Iike Rio?

79
00:09:50,657 --> 00:09:54,619
- lt was great. Did you get mypackage?
- Yeah, I got it yesterday.

80
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:59,290
- What did you think? Did you open it yet?
- HoId on, I'm gonna change phones.

81
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:09,134
What do you think? Did you get a chance
to look at everything?

82
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,969
I'm opening it now.

83
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:14,389
- Pretty postcards.
- Aren't those pretty?

84
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:16,683
- Cute brush.
- l saw a lady make that.

85
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,602
- A IittIe hat.
- lt's probably for a little doll.

86
00:10:19,769 --> 00:10:23,022
- A neckIace?
- lt's not really a necklace. lt's a rosary.

87
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,733
- Where did you get it?
- This little village...

88
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,653
- Belo Quinto.
- I didn't know you went there.

89
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,115
l took a little side trip.
So, the presents, do you love 'em?

90
00:10:32,282 --> 00:10:35,160
l'm so glad we talked.
l'm going on that cruise.

91
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:37,537
We won't talk for a month. l have to run.

92
00:10:37,704 --> 00:10:40,206
Have fun. I Iove you.
I'm gIad you caIIed, Mom. Bye.

93
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,771
- Can I get two Iattes, pIease? Low fat.
- Got it.

94
00:11:03,938 --> 00:11:06,900
- Just one. I'm OK.
- A bacon and egg sandwich, too.

95
00:11:08,234 --> 00:11:10,820
To go. What's up?
You're not eating today?

96
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:13,656
I threw up this morning
from the smeII of tea.

97
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:16,159
Late?

98
00:11:16,326 --> 00:11:18,244
- Like a week.
- A week?

99
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:21,080
I don't know. A few days. I feeI weird.

100
00:11:21,539 --> 00:11:23,541
You're so dramatic.

101
00:11:24,542 --> 00:11:27,295
I think you're just psyching yourseIf out.

102
00:11:27,462 --> 00:11:30,381
I feeI Iike my heart
went to go Iive in my stomach.

103
00:11:31,174 --> 00:11:32,884
OK, it's not traumatic!

104
00:11:33,051 --> 00:11:35,220
- What if I'm having a baby?
- With Steven?

105
00:11:35,386 --> 00:11:37,889
What if I'm bringing a person
into this worId?

106
00:11:38,056 --> 00:11:40,058
Man, what if? You've got options.

107
00:11:40,225 --> 00:11:43,311
I don't want to think about it.
It's making me cranky.

108
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:46,564
Let's get our tired asses to work
cos we are Iate.

109
00:11:46,731 --> 00:11:48,900
You're aIways Iate. There's nothing new.

110
00:12:00,411 --> 00:12:03,540
Ciao, beIIo!
Are you Iooking for a good time?

111
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:06,376
That is very kind of you,
but no, thank you.

112
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,962
Come on! Have some fun! Be a man!

113
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:15,009
No probIem!

114
00:12:15,176 --> 00:12:17,428
We'II give you the Vatican discount!

115
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:33,111
VATICAN CITY

116
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:52,839
- Father Andrew Kiernan, weIcome back.
- CardinaI Houseman.

117
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:55,800
These are interesting. What's the trick?

118
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:58,344
To be honest, I don't know.

119
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,014
They probabIy made a fortune out of her.

120
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,725
What's... What was this?

121
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:07,312
Infrared photographs of tears.
The statue's at room temperature,

122
00:13:07,478 --> 00:13:10,023
but the tears show up
as white because...

123
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,818
- Because they're warm.
- Warm tears?

124
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:15,403
Yes.

125
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:21,701
My Iab report and anaIysis confirm that
the bIood is not onIy warm, but... human.

126
00:13:24,537 --> 00:13:28,416
I know what you're thinking,
but with aII due respect, DanieI,

127
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,837
this isn't a fake. It's soIid stone.
There is no scientific expIanation.

128
00:13:33,004 --> 00:13:34,881
Andrew, you were sent to BraziI

129
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:39,552
to investigate the appearance of
the Virgin Mary on the side of a buiIding.

130
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:43,473
Yes, but in Sao PauIo I heard
about the statue, so I investigated.

131
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,433
- And?
- And what?

132
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,479
- The face of the Virgin Mary?
- It's an oxidation stain

133
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:53,149
caused by rainwater running down
untreated side waIIs.

134
00:13:53,316 --> 00:13:55,777
Causes an opticaI iIIusion
of a veiIed woman.

135
00:13:55,944 --> 00:13:58,196
Good. We'II consider the matter cIosed.

136
00:13:58,363 --> 00:14:01,032
Father Dario has your next assignment.

137
00:14:01,741 --> 00:14:06,788
I was hoping that perhaps you couId
send me back to BeIo Quinto.

138
00:14:06,954 --> 00:14:07,914
Why?

139
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:11,167
Because I need to do
some more tests on the statue.

140
00:14:11,334 --> 00:14:13,836
You've Ieft the statue in BeIo Quinto?

141
00:14:14,003 --> 00:14:16,714
Yes. I was going to take it back,

142
00:14:16,881 --> 00:14:19,759
but when I saw the effect
it had on the peopIe...

143
00:14:19,926 --> 00:14:22,428
It's become a cornerstone of their faith.

144
00:14:22,845 --> 00:14:26,516
Andrew, the cornerstone
of their faith is the Church,

145
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:28,685
not a crying statue.

146
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,229
You represent the CathoIic Church

147
00:14:31,396 --> 00:14:34,816
and the Congregation
of the Causes of the Saints.

148
00:14:34,982 --> 00:14:39,779
Yes, I'm very weII aware of that, DanieI,
but as a scientist I observe the facts.

149
00:14:39,946 --> 00:14:43,157
And the facts are that this statue
has tears of bIood.

150
00:14:43,324 --> 00:14:46,285
If that's the case,
you know the poIicy.

151
00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,331
The statue is brought back to the Vatican.
We conduct expert tests.

152
00:14:50,498 --> 00:14:53,042
GeoIogist, engineers, medicaI examiners.

153
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:57,171
We've examined 50 or 60 crying statues
in the Iast 12 months.

154
00:14:57,338 --> 00:14:59,257
Not a singIe one of them has...

155
00:14:59,424 --> 00:15:03,761
Yes, I'm aware of that, but I wanted you
to know that in my opinion

156
00:15:03,928 --> 00:15:06,222
I think that this is different.

157
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:08,725
I won't aIIow you to go back to BraziI.

158
00:15:08,891 --> 00:15:13,396
We'II send a geoIogist, and if he sees fit
we'II send the statue back for tests.

159
00:15:13,563 --> 00:15:17,859
Father Dario, get me aII the information
you can on this church in BeIo Quinto.

160
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,737
Thank you, Andrew.

161
00:15:23,156 --> 00:15:25,158
Thank you.

162
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:35,376
I have never seen him this way before.

163
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:40,214
Andrew's probIem is he can't decide
if he's a scientist or a priest.

164
00:15:43,301 --> 00:15:46,596
Frankie,
you are gonna drive yourseIf crazy.

165
00:15:46,763 --> 00:15:47,722
No.

166
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:52,393
If you're worried about being pregnant,
Iet's go to the store and get a test.

167
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,771
- Give it a coupIe of days.
- Are you sure?

168
00:15:54,937 --> 00:15:59,233
- I'm fine. Stop mothering me!
- AII right, girIfriend. I'II caII you Iater.

169
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,861
OK, bye. Drive safe.

170
00:16:27,345 --> 00:16:29,764
- Late?
- Like a week.

171
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:34,560
- You're always late. There's nothing new.
- What ifl'm bringing a person

172
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:37,647
- into this world?
- Frankie, you've got options.

173
00:18:45,233 --> 00:18:48,486
Nurse, what's going on?
I don't understand.

174
00:18:48,653 --> 00:18:50,863
- Get out of the way!
- Frankie, can you hear me?

175
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,657
I'm right here with you.

176
00:18:52,823 --> 00:18:54,200
Let's go!

177
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:56,661
Why is there so much bIood?

178
00:18:56,827 --> 00:18:58,204
Get me a cIamp right now.

179
00:18:58,371 --> 00:19:01,374
AII right, CBC, eIectroIytes,
UA, tox screen.

180
00:19:03,251 --> 00:19:04,835
Get me a puIse box, stat!

181
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:09,131
- Get me a tox screen and a stat CT.
- Heart rate is irreguIar.

182
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:11,592
BIood pressure's off the map.
195 over 120.

183
00:19:12,802 --> 00:19:15,304
- Let's change cuffs.
- Where's the IV?

184
00:19:23,646 --> 00:19:26,857
I'm caIIing it. Code bIue.
Get the paddIes. Get some geI.

185
00:19:27,024 --> 00:19:28,109
OK, ready?

186
00:19:28,275 --> 00:19:30,569
- Get the paddIes.
- AII right, cIear.

187
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:34,198
Temperature and bIood pressure
are back to normaI.

188
00:19:35,449 --> 00:19:37,827
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr Reston.

189
00:19:37,994 --> 00:19:40,788
- Do you know what your name is?
- What happened?

190
00:19:40,955 --> 00:19:43,457
- Where am I?
- You're in the emergency room.

191
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:46,460
You were found unconscious.
Do you remember anything?

192
00:19:46,627 --> 00:19:47,920
No.

193
00:19:48,087 --> 00:19:48,921
Jesus!

194
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:52,383
Can I get some more heIp over here?
We need some four-by-fours.

195
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:57,054
We have a very deep Iaceration here.
Oh, my God, it's gone right through.

196
00:19:57,221 --> 00:19:59,140
Miss, you can't go in there.

197
00:19:59,307 --> 00:20:01,517
Doctor, I just need to know what's...

198
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:04,603
She'II be fine.
PIease have a seat. Thank you.

199
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:09,775
These are puncture wounds
caused by the entry of a sharp object.

200
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,402
Are you in any pain?

201
00:20:11,569 --> 00:20:13,863
No. That's weird, isn't it?

202
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:17,450
Wow, wiII you Iook at that!
It onIy bIeeds when I touch it.

203
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:19,660
Maybe you shouId not touch it.

204
00:20:19,827 --> 00:20:22,496
Both wounds are identicaI.
The same size, same shape.

205
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:25,416
She missed the main artery
by Iess then a centimetre.

206
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:27,668
You keep saying ''she''. I didn't do this.

207
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,091
What's happening in your Iife, Frankie?
Do you have a Iot of stress at work?

208
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:36,218
I cut hair.

209
00:20:36,385 --> 00:20:38,763
Any troubIe with a significant other?

210
00:20:38,929 --> 00:20:41,057
- Yes.
- And that is?

211
00:20:41,223 --> 00:20:43,350
I'm not very significant.

212
00:20:43,517 --> 00:20:46,187
Look, how Iong's this gonna take?
I wanna go home.

213
00:20:46,312 --> 00:20:49,482
You shouId stay here.
We need to get a handIe on this.

214
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:51,817
There's nothing to get a handIe on.

215
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:56,489
I won't kid you. With wounds Iike this,
it's obvious they were seIf-infIicted.

216
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,741
You think I did this?

217
00:21:00,534 --> 00:21:02,453
It wouId never happen.

218
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:06,290
I Iove being me. Ask anyone.

219
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:24,225
Frankie,

220
00:21:24,391 --> 00:21:27,186
turn the Iight off, honey,
and come to bed.

221
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,988
Do you smeII fIowers
in here or something?

222
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:40,366
No.

223
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:44,328
SmeIIs Iike jasmine
or hyacinth or something.

224
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:48,374
I don't smeII anything.

225
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,962
You need anything?

226
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:55,047
No.

227
00:21:55,297 --> 00:21:56,966
Good night.

228
00:21:57,133 --> 00:21:58,801
Good night.

229
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:20,156
- I'm here to see Brother DeImonico.
- You've got to sign in.

230
00:22:20,322 --> 00:22:23,993
- I'II onIy be five minutes.
- Everyone has to sign in.

231
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,082
Duty-free.

232
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:34,086
- WeIcome back, Andrew.
- Gianni, come stai?

233
00:22:35,212 --> 00:22:37,173
God is good.

234
00:22:37,339 --> 00:22:39,300
So how was BeIo Quinto?

235
00:22:39,466 --> 00:22:42,678
How do you know about BeIo Quinto?
I was sent to Sao PauIo.

236
00:22:42,845 --> 00:22:45,848
- God Iives here. We know everything.
- Oh, yes, I forgot.

237
00:22:46,015 --> 00:22:47,308
So how are you doing?

238
00:22:47,475 --> 00:22:49,476
I don't know.

239
00:22:50,311 --> 00:22:52,188
I don't know.

240
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:56,400
I traveI round the worId
investigating... miracIes.

241
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,569
And then I disprove them.

242
00:22:58,736 --> 00:23:00,988
The reaI miracIe is
anybody beIieves anything.

243
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:05,993
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- None of us know what we are doing.

244
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,829
- So what are you working on?
- I have no idea.

245
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:12,041
How can you transIate something
if you've no idea?

246
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:16,045
I'm a Iinguist.
I transIate words, not their reIevance.

247
00:23:16,212 --> 00:23:20,090
- But this one is a second-century gospeI.
- How many is that now?

248
00:23:20,257 --> 00:23:23,093
I've heIped transIate about 1 5.

249
00:23:23,719 --> 00:23:25,846
That onIy Ieaves 20 stiII to go.

250
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:28,474
So there are... what? 35 gospeIs?

251
00:23:28,641 --> 00:23:33,687
Everyone had a different experience
of Jesus, so they wrote different stories.

252
00:23:33,854 --> 00:23:37,066
AII the gospeIs,
they are interpretations,

253
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:38,984
memories,

254
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,195
dreams, refIections.

255
00:23:41,362 --> 00:23:45,032
And there's no one gospeI
in Jesus' actuaI words?

256
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,077
We're aII bIind men in a cave,

257
00:23:48,244 --> 00:23:51,622
Iooking for the candIe
that was Iit 2,000 years ago.

258
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:53,874
So what's in this text?

259
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:56,043
I was onIy given every third page.

260
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,255
- Why?
- The most sensitive documents

261
00:23:59,421 --> 00:24:02,132
are aIways divided into threes among us.

262
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:05,511
One third to the Dominicans,
one third to the Franciscans,

263
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,805
and one third to us Jesuits.

264
00:24:07,972 --> 00:24:12,059
The truth of any document
is onIy known to a very powerfuI few.

265
00:24:12,226 --> 00:24:15,896
That's typicaI of this pIace, isn't it?

266
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:20,192
We Iive in a highIy competitive worId,
Andrew.

267
00:24:20,484 --> 00:24:22,486
The Church is no exception.

268
00:24:24,571 --> 00:24:27,074
Nothing ever gets out of here, does it?

269
00:24:27,408 --> 00:24:29,910
UnIess, of course, they want it to.

270
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:37,084
Both wounds are identical.
Same size, same shape.

271
00:24:37,251 --> 00:24:39,920
She missed the main artery
by less than a centimetre.

272
00:24:40,045 --> 00:24:42,006
You think l did this?

273
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:44,842
What's happening in your life, Frankie?

274
00:24:51,682 --> 00:24:55,311
- So, Jen, teII us about your date.
- It was with a tax Iawyer.

275
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:57,479
A tax Iawyer?

276
00:24:57,646 --> 00:25:00,024
When I met him he seemed cooI.

277
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,942
Hey, hi, you guys.

278
00:25:02,109 --> 00:25:04,528
- How are you feeIing?
- Fine.

279
00:25:07,948 --> 00:25:09,950
ReaIIy OK, or just OK?

280
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:13,162
I'm fine. So how's my day Iooking?

281
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:16,081
I started your first cIient
and you're booked soIid.

282
00:25:16,248 --> 00:25:18,959
Thanks. Wanna come over here?

283
00:25:19,126 --> 00:25:21,795
OK, weII, go back to Jen and dish the dirt.

284
00:25:23,505 --> 00:25:24,798
So,

285
00:25:24,965 --> 00:25:26,967
he seemed pretty cooI.

286
00:25:27,134 --> 00:25:29,136
Divorced, but no kids.

287
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:35,309
But he Ieft the tabIe in the middIe of
dinner to caII his mother in Oregon.

288
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:37,603
Major points for the Iong-distance mom.

289
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,731
Yeah. You know,
I thought I'd give him a shot,

290
00:25:40,898 --> 00:25:43,859
but you won't beIieve what he did.

291
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:48,155
Every singIe time he took
a bite of his steak,

292
00:25:48,322 --> 00:25:50,741
he growIed. He growIed!

293
00:26:45,629 --> 00:26:46,922
Shit!

294
00:26:47,089 --> 00:26:49,466
Stop! There's a baby!

295
00:26:51,135 --> 00:26:51,927
Stop!

296
00:26:52,094 --> 00:26:53,387
Wait!

297
00:26:53,554 --> 00:26:55,597
There's a baby!

298
00:26:56,724 --> 00:26:59,143
Frankie, what are you doing!

299
00:27:02,187 --> 00:27:03,897
Where's the baby?!

300
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,108
Watch it, Iady!

301
00:27:06,275 --> 00:27:09,445
- Frankie!
- Where's the Iady! Did you see her!

302
00:27:09,611 --> 00:27:11,280
She dropped her baby!

303
00:27:11,447 --> 00:27:16,618
Frankie, there was no baby, honey.
There's no baby and there's no Iady.

304
00:27:16,785 --> 00:27:19,329
- What's happening?
- No, honey, it's...

305
00:27:24,334 --> 00:27:26,420
There was a Iady. I saw her!

306
00:27:26,587 --> 00:27:29,298
- There was not a Iady.
- She dropped her baby!

307
00:27:29,465 --> 00:27:31,467
I swear... I swear!

308
00:27:32,342 --> 00:27:34,553
I just wanna get you home, OK?

309
00:27:46,815 --> 00:27:48,817
You aII right?

310
00:27:50,194 --> 00:27:52,196
We'II be home in a minute.

311
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:40,577
- Frankie...
- Hey, you!

312
00:28:40,744 --> 00:28:43,705
- Are you speaking to me?
- Are you Andrew Kiernan?

313
00:28:43,872 --> 00:28:46,833
Andrew Kiernan? No.
My name's Father Durning.

314
00:28:51,088 --> 00:28:52,464
May I heIp you?

315
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:55,384
No-one can heIp me now. I'm fucked.

316
00:30:22,304 --> 00:30:25,432
Passengers please exit the train.

317
00:30:26,266 --> 00:30:28,268
Somebody heIp!

318
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:53,126
Frankie Paige?

319
00:30:53,293 --> 00:30:55,754
We're gonna scheduIe some more tests

320
00:30:55,921 --> 00:31:00,050
- for this afternoon around four.
- Did you run a pregnancy test?

321
00:31:00,217 --> 00:31:01,968
Yes.

322
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:04,638
Am I pregnant?

323
00:31:04,805 --> 00:31:06,223
No.

324
00:31:06,390 --> 00:31:10,018
- Was I?
- I don't know.

325
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,297
Take this, aII of you, and drink from it,
for this is the cup of my bIood,

326
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:43,176
shed for you, and for aII men,
so that sins may be forgiven.

327
00:31:43,343 --> 00:31:46,013
Do this in memory of me.

328
00:31:46,888 --> 00:31:48,890
This is the bIood of Christ.

329
00:31:54,688 --> 00:31:56,690
This is the bIood of Christ.

330
00:32:03,739 --> 00:32:05,741
This is the bIood of Christ.

331
00:32:29,514 --> 00:32:32,768
WeII, am I psychotic, or dying, or both?

332
00:32:32,934 --> 00:32:35,228
WeII, none of the above.

333
00:32:35,395 --> 00:32:38,565
ActuaIIy,
I think that you are quite rationaI,

334
00:32:38,732 --> 00:32:42,027
and despite your wounds
you're in very good heaIth.

335
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:46,323
But there is another possibiIity
that is of concern.

336
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:47,741
EpiIepsy.

337
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:50,076
EpiIepsy?

338
00:32:50,786 --> 00:32:53,163
We've run some preIiminary tests,

339
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:57,375
and, aII things considered,
I think it might expIain a Iot.

340
00:32:57,542 --> 00:32:59,753
But that seems impossibIe.

341
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,798
How can you just wake up one day
and have that?

342
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:07,385
WeII, you can't, but, uh,
you described bIunt trauma to the head,

343
00:33:07,552 --> 00:33:10,597
disturbing haIIucinations.
You're hearing voices.

344
00:33:10,764 --> 00:33:14,351
- These couId aII indicate epiIepsy.
- So what do we do now?

345
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:19,439
We're gonna insert some eIectrodes
into the upper neo-cortex.

346
00:33:19,606 --> 00:33:24,152
Wait a minute, wait.
You want to put wires inside my head?

347
00:33:24,319 --> 00:33:29,074
Frankie, we're gonna do whatever we can
to find out what's causing this.

348
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:31,660
You hang in there.

349
00:33:47,509 --> 00:33:49,177
Epilepsy?

350
00:33:49,344 --> 00:33:53,265
- You shouId get a second opinion.
- Miss Paige?

351
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:54,850
I'm Father Durning.

352
00:33:55,016 --> 00:33:57,018
You spoke to me on the train.

353
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:01,523
- I'd Iike to taIk about what happened.
- Why?

354
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:04,359
Do you know what the stigmata are?

355
00:34:04,484 --> 00:34:07,404
Father,
I gotta get Frankie home. Thanks.

356
00:34:07,571 --> 00:34:11,741
I understand how you feeI, but pIease
caII me if you change your mind.

357
00:34:17,122 --> 00:34:19,791
Andrew, come in.

358
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:22,419
I think we've found your next assignment.

359
00:34:22,586 --> 00:34:26,214
I was hoping you'd changed your mind
about sending me to BeIo Quinto.

360
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:29,259
We have no record
of a church in BeIo Quinto.

361
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,638
What? That's impossibIe.
There must be some mistake.

362
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:36,975
No mistake, Father.
I have checked into it myseIf.

363
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:41,354
If there is a church in BeIo Quinto,
it is not one of ours.

364
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,773
And no record of a priest there, either.

365
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:48,612
This was sent by a Father Durning in
Pittsburgh, from the train security camera.

366
00:34:48,778 --> 00:34:52,032
What are we supposed to be Iooking for?

367
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,366
Watch.

368
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:56,161
Stop.

369
00:34:59,164 --> 00:35:01,583
ObviousIy it is some sort of attack.

370
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:05,086
Maybe possession.
The wrists are bandaged.

371
00:35:05,253 --> 00:35:08,757
According to Father Durning,
she was whipped repeatedIy

372
00:35:08,924 --> 00:35:11,176
by an unseen force.

373
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:15,138
- How important is this reaIIy, DanieI?
- We don't know yet.

374
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:17,599
Then why are you sending me?

375
00:35:17,766 --> 00:35:21,102
Because of this cIipping
from the Pittsburgh Globe.

376
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:25,899
''Twenty terrified witnesses...
unexpIained wounds...

377
00:35:26,066 --> 00:35:28,985
..CathoIic priest.''
The pubIicity is unfortunate,

378
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,738
but by the time I get there
it wiII have bIown over.

379
00:35:31,905 --> 00:35:33,907
We're investigating this one.

380
00:35:55,845 --> 00:35:57,138
You know what I heard?

381
00:35:57,305 --> 00:36:01,059
CathoIic priest in the paper said
that it was something Iike...

382
00:36:02,727 --> 00:36:04,521
- Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

383
00:36:04,688 --> 00:36:06,690
- Hey, Frankie.
- Hey, Frankie.

384
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:09,609
Hey, I feeI Iike I shouId do a monoIogue.

385
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:15,365
Hey, CheryI. Come on over here
and have a seat. I'II just be a second.

386
00:36:15,532 --> 00:36:19,160
You know what?
I think I'm just gonna wait for Donna.

387
00:36:20,328 --> 00:36:22,330
Oh. OK.

388
00:36:29,296 --> 00:36:33,383
- What's going on with her?
- She wants to get a second opinion.

389
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:36,928
- They think she might have epiIepsy.
- EpiIepsy?

390
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,015
She doesn't Iook too good.

391
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:44,227
- Why is she even at work?
- Hey! WouId you guys stop whispering

392
00:36:44,394 --> 00:36:46,688
Iike this was a goddamn church!

393
00:36:52,861 --> 00:36:54,821
- Hi.
- HeIIo.

394
00:36:54,988 --> 00:36:56,990
Do you have an appointment, or...

395
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:58,867
No, I don't.

396
00:36:59,034 --> 00:37:04,122
WouId you Iike a haircut, a manicure,
or maybe you'd Iike your nippIes pierced?

397
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:10,754
WeII, maybe if we just start with a trim,
we couId go from there.

398
00:37:11,629 --> 00:37:14,174
- Thank you.
- Come on. Have a seat.

399
00:37:16,843 --> 00:37:20,680
Here we go. I'II put this cape on
so you don't get a scratchy neck.

400
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:22,015
Thank you.

401
00:37:24,392 --> 00:37:25,894
So, where are you from?

402
00:37:26,061 --> 00:37:27,771
I Iive in Rome, actuaIIy.

403
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:30,482
- CooI.
- And you?

404
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:33,693
- I'm from NapIes.
- NapIes.

405
00:37:35,028 --> 00:37:37,447
NapIes, la citta piu bella del mondo.

406
00:37:37,614 --> 00:37:41,326
NapIes, FIorida.
I moved here to go to schooI.

407
00:37:41,493 --> 00:37:43,495
Which schooI?

408
00:37:44,037 --> 00:37:47,916
CIaudia's University of CosmetoIogy.
See, I'm accredited.

409
00:37:48,083 --> 00:37:50,460
Oh. CooI.

410
00:37:52,379 --> 00:37:55,340
Am I going crazy,
or is Frankie hitting on a priest?

411
00:37:55,507 --> 00:37:59,511
What do I caII you? I feeI weird
caIIing a guy I couId date ''Father''.

412
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:04,099
I mean, I couIdn't date you,
but... you know.

413
00:38:04,265 --> 00:38:06,810
Oh, no, you just made my day.

414
00:38:06,976 --> 00:38:10,313
Thank you. You can caII me Andrew.

415
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,607
Andrew Kiernan, that's my name.

416
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:19,406
Donna.

417
00:38:25,328 --> 00:38:28,832
I know this is gonna sound
kinda strange, but

418
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:31,417
I've sorta been expecting you.

419
00:38:37,674 --> 00:38:41,970
- So, you Iive in Rome?
- Yes, but I traveI a Iot, so I'm rareIy there.

420
00:38:42,137 --> 00:38:43,930
- Thank you.
- Coffee, honey?

421
00:38:44,097 --> 00:38:47,183
No, thanks.
So what brings you to PennsyIvania?

422
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:50,186
Father Durning asked us
to speak to you, Miss Paige.

423
00:38:50,353 --> 00:38:52,564
Us? Who's us?
I thought you were a priest.

424
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,818
I am, but I'm aIso an investigator.
I work for a division in the Vatican

425
00:38:56,985 --> 00:39:00,155
caIIed the Congregation for
the Causes of the Saints.

426
00:39:01,656 --> 00:39:05,034
- Do you mind if I switch this on?
- No, go ahead.

427
00:39:05,201 --> 00:39:07,662
What is... What is your fuII name?

428
00:39:07,829 --> 00:39:09,831
Frankie Paige.

429
00:39:10,373 --> 00:39:12,709
- And your age?
- 23.

430
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:16,504
- And... which church do you attend?
- I don't attend church.

431
00:39:16,671 --> 00:39:18,673
But you are CathoIic?

432
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,635
No, I don't go to church
because I don't beIieve in God.

433
00:39:25,847 --> 00:39:30,852
WeII... that's gonna be it for me.
That's aII I need to know, Miss Paige.

434
00:39:31,019 --> 00:39:32,729
That's it?

435
00:39:32,896 --> 00:39:34,355
Yes.

436
00:39:34,522 --> 00:39:37,775
You see, stigmatics are
deepIy reIigious peopIe.

437
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:39,861
And there's no exceptions?

438
00:39:40,028 --> 00:39:43,239
- No.
- WeII, why do they get stigmata?

439
00:39:43,406 --> 00:39:46,743
When Christ died on the cross
he... he died with

440
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,453
five wounds.

441
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,663
His back was scourged by whips.

442
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:54,542
There were gashes in his forehead
from a crown of thorns.

443
00:39:54,709 --> 00:39:57,754
There were naiIs driven through
his hands and feet.

444
00:39:59,506 --> 00:40:01,257
And finaIIy a spear

445
00:40:01,424 --> 00:40:04,135
driven through his side.

446
00:40:05,011 --> 00:40:06,763
Throughout history

447
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:11,184
onIy deepIy devout peopIe have been

448
00:40:11,351 --> 00:40:13,353
affIicted with these wounds.

449
00:40:13,561 --> 00:40:15,021
Why?

450
00:40:15,188 --> 00:40:17,649
There is no scientific expIanation.

451
00:40:17,815 --> 00:40:21,694
AII stigmatics are haunted
by such intense spirituaI pain.

452
00:40:21,861 --> 00:40:26,616
In some ways it affects them physicaIIy.
They're assauIted by visions of eviI,

453
00:40:26,783 --> 00:40:29,577
and they manifest this battIe
in their bodies.

454
00:40:29,744 --> 00:40:32,914
The Church, on the other hand,
regards it as a gift.

455
00:40:33,081 --> 00:40:34,415
A gift from God.

456
00:40:34,582 --> 00:40:37,710
A gift? Can I give it back?

457
00:40:42,048 --> 00:40:46,636
Listen, Father, can I show you these
and you couId teII me what you think?

458
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,931
Yes. Yes, of course.

459
00:41:20,253 --> 00:41:22,046
Coffee, honey?

460
00:41:24,257 --> 00:41:26,175
WeII, what do you think?

461
00:41:26,342 --> 00:41:29,929
- It doesn't reaIIy matter what I think.
- What does that mean?

462
00:41:30,096 --> 00:41:32,807
It means officiaIIy
this is not a case for the Church.

463
00:41:32,974 --> 00:41:38,438
To say that a seIf-confessed atheist
exhibits the wounds of Christ

464
00:41:38,605 --> 00:41:40,690
- is a contradiction in terms.
- Here.

465
00:41:40,857 --> 00:41:44,235
Read that. I found that on my kitchen
tabIe the other morning.

466
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:47,739
Now, I don't know what that says,
but that handwriting is mine.

467
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,449
It's ItaIian.

468
00:41:49,616 --> 00:41:53,870
It says, ''SpIit a piece of wood
and I'm there.''

469
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:57,081
''Lift a stone and you wiII find me.''

470
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:00,710
- It's quite beautifuI, actuaIIy.
- This isn't beautifuI!

471
00:42:00,877 --> 00:42:03,629
This is a warning!
It means no matter what I do,...

472
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:05,882
- Miss Paige...
- ..I can't escape it.

473
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:10,094
- Miss Paige, I wouId reaIIy Iike to heIp...
- You know what?

474
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,306
This is not going anywhere.
You don't know what this is.

475
00:42:13,473 --> 00:42:16,476
You can't give me an answer.
Coffee's on me. Here.

476
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:50,134
There is no scientific explanation.

477
00:42:54,263 --> 00:42:57,100
Stigmatics are deeply religious people.

478
00:42:58,267 --> 00:43:00,853
We're gonna do whatever we can

479
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,733
to find out, but, all things considered,
l think it might explain a lot.

480
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,571
Throughout history,
only people who believe deeply in God

481
00:43:10,738 --> 00:43:13,950
have been afflicted with these wounds.
The nearer they come to God,

482
00:43:14,117 --> 00:43:16,869
the more open they are
to the torment oftheir demons.

483
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,456
The Church regards it as a gift.

484
00:43:20,623 --> 00:43:22,458
A gift from God.

485
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,764
- Here's to Friday night.
- Yeah. To Friday night, honey.

486
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:42,437
Frankie!

487
00:43:44,355 --> 00:43:48,860
Don't worry. Order another drink.
I'II be right back. I'm gonna check it out.

488
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:50,445
 But youjust can't tell

489
00:43:50,611 --> 00:43:53,114
 Don't hold your breath
But the pretty things are going to hell

490
00:43:53,281 --> 00:43:55,199
- Hey, girIfriend.
- Hey.

491
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:58,661
- What's up? I thought you were resting.
- Have you seen Steven?

492
00:43:58,828 --> 00:44:01,706
Forget about Steven.
What's up with that priest?

493
00:44:01,873 --> 00:44:03,833
BeIieve me, he's aII business.

494
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,169
Hey, can we get two doubIes each?

495
00:44:06,335 --> 00:44:09,380
Hey, you know what's scarier
than not beIieving in God?

496
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:10,882
BeIieving in him.

497
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:14,927
I mean reaIIy beIieving in him
is a fucking terrifying thought.

498
00:44:15,094 --> 00:44:17,847
It's Friday night.
You're taking things too seriousIy.

499
00:44:18,014 --> 00:44:21,184
If there is a God, he hates me.
He's ruining my Iife.

500
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,811
Frankie, it's gonna be aII right. Man, reIax.

501
00:44:23,978 --> 00:44:27,440
You don't get it, do you?
I have fucking hoIes through my wrists!

502
00:44:27,607 --> 00:44:30,067
I have sIashes across my back!

503
00:44:30,234 --> 00:44:33,404
If it isn't God that's doing this to me,
then who is?

504
00:44:34,822 --> 00:44:36,908
I think you're Iosing it, man.

505
00:44:39,869 --> 00:44:41,871
Where you goin'?

506
00:44:43,206 --> 00:44:44,415
Frankie!

507
00:44:54,342 --> 00:44:55,176
Frankie!

508
00:44:57,053 --> 00:44:58,679
Frankie, get up!

509
00:44:58,846 --> 00:45:01,015
Get up! Frankie!

510
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,444
Don't just fuckin' stand there!
CaII an ambuIance!

511
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:14,445
Damn.

512
00:45:26,165 --> 00:45:28,334
Frankie, where are you?!

513
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:44,016
Get out of there!

514
00:46:09,375 --> 00:46:11,502
Miss Paige?

515
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:13,457
Frankie!

516
00:48:26,429 --> 00:48:30,391
- Let's get you outta here.
- Frankie.

517
00:48:30,558 --> 00:48:36,230
- We need to get her to a safe pIace.
- Here, I got you. I got you.

518
00:49:11,515 --> 00:49:14,685
- WeIcome back.
- Where am I?

519
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:17,313
You're in Father Durning's church.

520
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:21,108
Here.

521
00:49:21,275 --> 00:49:23,277
I think she shouId get some rest.

522
00:49:23,944 --> 00:49:26,155
You aII right?

523
00:49:30,826 --> 00:49:33,078
You Iook Iike shit.

524
00:49:33,245 --> 00:49:35,247
It smeIIs Iike...

525
00:49:36,832 --> 00:49:38,084
fIowers.

526
00:49:39,043 --> 00:49:41,712
You've got stuff aII in your hair.

527
00:50:04,777 --> 00:50:05,736
Pronto.

528
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:08,572
- Gianni, come stai?
- Andrew, how are you?

529
00:50:08,697 --> 00:50:09,907
Gianni, listen...

530
00:50:10,074 --> 00:50:13,160
- CouId you transIate something?
- Si. Do you have it there?

531
00:50:13,327 --> 00:50:15,579
Yes, I have it here. I'II pIay it.

532
00:50:26,549 --> 00:50:28,008
Thama...

533
00:50:28,175 --> 00:50:32,596
- WeII, what is it? Is it gibberish?
- No, it's not gibberish at all.

534
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,557
Who is speaking?

535
00:51:44,543 --> 00:51:48,631
- Morning, Miss Paige. You're up earIy.
- Hey, I think you made a mistake.

536
00:51:48,797 --> 00:51:51,258
- What do you mean?
- I can't have stigmata.

537
00:51:51,425 --> 00:51:55,137
Jesus was crucified through
the paIms of his hands, not his wrists.

538
00:51:55,304 --> 00:51:58,307
My wounds are through the wrists.
So you're wrong.

539
00:51:58,474 --> 00:52:03,562
ActuaIIy, scientists have discovered that
in Roman times peopIe were crucified

540
00:52:03,729 --> 00:52:06,023
through the wrists, not the paIms.

541
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,692
The hands couIdn't support
the body weight,

542
00:52:08,859 --> 00:52:11,195
so they did crucify them
through the wrists.

543
00:52:11,362 --> 00:52:16,075
No, wait, you're teIIing me
that every painting,

544
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:18,327
every statue ofChrist,

545
00:52:18,494 --> 00:52:21,455
every singIe crucifix
in the whoIe worId is wrong?

546
00:52:21,622 --> 00:52:26,168
No, no, just inaccurate.
They're impressions of the truth.

547
00:52:26,335 --> 00:52:29,964
Icons are meant to be inspirationaI.

548
00:52:30,130 --> 00:52:33,342
Miss Paige,
there's something eIse you shouId know.

549
00:52:33,509 --> 00:52:37,388
The words you keep repeating
that, uh, you thought were nonsense.

550
00:52:37,554 --> 00:52:39,431
It's not.

551
00:52:39,598 --> 00:52:43,686
It's actuaIIy a very specific Ianguage.
It's a form of Aramaic.

552
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:45,980
What?

553
00:52:46,146 --> 00:52:49,483
It's a form of Aramaic
that hasn't been used for 1900 years.

554
00:52:49,650 --> 00:52:53,028
It's a diaIect that was used in GaIiIee
around the time of Jesus.

555
00:53:34,737 --> 00:53:37,656
Split a piece of wood and l am there.

556
00:53:38,032 --> 00:53:40,868
Lift a stone and you will find me.

557
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,592
- Did you get through?
- No.

558
00:54:38,759 --> 00:54:40,761
Her machine didn't even pick up.

559
00:55:05,786 --> 00:55:07,788
Miss Paige?

560
00:55:41,655 --> 00:55:43,282
Frankie?

561
00:56:17,649 --> 00:56:19,443
Who are you?

562
00:56:23,864 --> 00:56:26,950
The messenger is not important.

563
00:58:12,306 --> 00:58:15,559
I feeI Iike my heart is breaking.

564
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:21,315
Why am I so sad?

565
00:58:29,448 --> 00:58:31,450
It smeIIs Iike fIowers in here.

566
00:58:34,244 --> 00:58:37,122
Like... jasmine or...

567
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:41,126
..rose or something.

568
00:58:41,793 --> 00:58:44,463
- Can you smeII that?
- Yes, I can.

569
00:58:48,508 --> 00:58:50,636
- Who wrote that?
- You did.

570
00:58:50,802 --> 00:58:53,805
- l wrote that?!
- Yes.

571
00:59:06,985 --> 00:59:09,780
- Have you heard from Father Andrew?
- No, Eminence.

572
00:59:09,946 --> 00:59:12,949
- He hasn't fiIed a report.
- What are these?

573
00:59:13,116 --> 00:59:16,495
These are newspaper cIippings
from our office in New York.

574
00:59:16,662 --> 00:59:18,914
The first one is from PennsyIvania.

575
00:59:19,081 --> 00:59:21,875
The others are from New York
and Washington.

576
00:59:22,042 --> 00:59:26,421
These are even more damaging.
This one mentions the stigmata.

577
00:59:26,588 --> 00:59:30,634
- He isn't defusing the situation.
- ShaII I caII him home?

578
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:35,931
Have him concIude his investigation
and report to me in New York next week.

579
00:59:40,602 --> 00:59:44,272
Frankie, can you pIease come over here
and have a Iook at this?

580
00:59:44,439 --> 00:59:47,692
I just can't beIieve that none of this
means anything to you.

581
00:59:52,239 --> 00:59:53,198
Frankie?

582
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:03,417
Frankie, can you pIease...

583
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:09,548
Can you pIease Iook at this?

584
01:00:09,798 --> 01:00:14,261
Sometimes subjects retain fragments
or images that can be transmitted

585
01:00:14,428 --> 01:00:15,554
subconsciousIy.

586
01:00:15,720 --> 01:00:19,641
This subject doesn't retain
fragments of images.

587
01:00:19,808 --> 01:00:24,479
You don't get it, do you, Father Kiernan?
I don't know what the heII that means!

588
01:00:24,646 --> 01:00:28,775
I don't know what the heII this means.
I just want my Iife back, OK?

589
01:00:35,323 --> 01:00:39,661
 l'm sitting amongst yourselves

590
01:00:39,828 --> 01:00:43,999
 Don't think you can see me

591
01:00:44,749 --> 01:00:48,295
 l haven't gone anywhere

592
01:00:49,463 --> 01:00:53,091
 But out ofmy body

593
01:00:54,426 --> 01:00:58,263
 Reach out and touch me

594
01:00:59,222 --> 01:01:03,185
 Make effort to speak to me

595
01:01:04,019 --> 01:01:07,898
 Call out and you'll hear me

596
01:01:08,815 --> 01:01:12,277
 Be happy for me...

597
01:01:12,444 --> 01:01:14,362
Miss Paige?

598
01:01:14,529 --> 01:01:18,366
Miss Paige, I'm sorry.

599
01:01:18,575 --> 01:01:21,536
Don't ''Miss Paige'' me
just because you messed up.

600
01:01:21,703 --> 01:01:23,997
I'm not gonna Iet you off the hook.

601
01:01:24,164 --> 01:01:27,459
OK, but I am sorry.

602
01:01:27,626 --> 01:01:30,670
You know, for a priest
you're pretty reIentIess.

603
01:01:30,837 --> 01:01:35,383
Yeah, I guess I stopped being a priest
and sIipped back into being a scientist.

604
01:01:35,550 --> 01:01:37,511
It happens.

605
01:01:37,677 --> 01:01:40,764
Hey, what kind of a scientist
is a priest, anyway?

606
01:01:40,931 --> 01:01:42,933
You don't want to know.

607
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:45,393
Oh, yes, I do!

608
01:01:45,602 --> 01:01:47,437
You were an organic chemist?

609
01:01:47,604 --> 01:01:50,273
Did you waIk around
with those gIasses

610
01:01:50,398 --> 01:01:54,152
with Scotch tape around the sides,
and pocket protectors?

611
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:56,530
I did, actuaIIy.

612
01:01:56,696 --> 01:02:01,034
Anyway, one day I just decided that
I was going to become a priest.

613
01:02:01,201 --> 01:02:02,160
Why?

614
01:02:02,327 --> 01:02:04,579
- The hoIes.
- The hoIes?

615
01:02:04,746 --> 01:02:07,123
- The hoIes in the theories.
- What theories?

616
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,459
The worId is six biIIion years oId.

617
01:02:09,626 --> 01:02:14,548
There's been Iife for three biIIion years,
but before that there was nothing.

618
01:02:14,714 --> 01:02:18,093
No Iife.
Just a bunch of eIements swirIing around.

619
01:02:18,260 --> 01:02:21,388
And then one day,
for no apparent reason whatsoever,

620
01:02:21,555 --> 01:02:24,599
aII these eIements
came together in perfect harmony

621
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:26,726
and there was suddenIy Iife.

622
01:02:26,893 --> 01:02:30,397
Living things Iike IiIac
and... and hedgehogs and...

623
01:02:30,564 --> 01:02:32,566
Beer and... cheesecake.

624
01:02:32,732 --> 01:02:36,111
Beer and cheesecake.
Did you know monks invented aIcohoI?

625
01:02:36,278 --> 01:02:38,947
- Yeah. Everybody knows that.
- You knew that?

626
01:02:39,072 --> 01:02:40,031
Yeah.

627
01:02:40,198 --> 01:02:44,035
WeII, anyway, to get back to the big hoIe.
There reaIIy...

628
01:02:44,202 --> 01:02:46,538
There reaIIy isn't any expIanation.

629
01:02:47,163 --> 01:02:50,166
And, I figured that
there was something more than

630
01:02:50,333 --> 01:02:53,461
weII, more important than
organic chemistry going on,

631
01:02:53,628 --> 01:02:55,839
and I figured that... it was God.

632
01:02:56,006 --> 01:02:59,634
And that God was responsibIe
for aII this... Iife.

633
01:02:59,801 --> 01:03:03,221
- I reaIIy can't get a Iine on you.
- Why not?

634
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:07,851
- I can't understand a man who's never...
- Never made Iove to a woman?

635
01:03:08,018 --> 01:03:11,730
WeII, this may come
as a great surprise to you, but

636
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:14,149
I wasn't born a priest.

637
01:03:15,567 --> 01:03:17,903
- You didn't Iike it?
- What's not to Iike?

638
01:03:18,069 --> 01:03:21,239
- But you don't miss it?
- Yes, of course I miss it.

639
01:03:21,406 --> 01:03:23,992
I mean, I'm human, you know.

640
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:29,623
I struggIe with it, but I've made a choice.
BasicaIIy, I've exchanged

641
01:03:29,789 --> 01:03:32,834
one set of compIications for another.

642
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,784
So this is the fourth?

643
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:50,620
- What do you mean?
- When I first met you,

644
01:04:50,745 --> 01:04:53,790
didn't you say that
there were five wounds?

645
01:04:53,957 --> 01:04:57,335
WeII, this is the fourth. What's the fifth?

646
01:04:59,212 --> 01:05:01,214
The spear.

647
01:05:01,715 --> 01:05:03,883
That's the wound that kiIIed him.

648
01:05:04,050 --> 01:05:06,052
Don't worry, Frankie.

649
01:05:06,219 --> 01:05:09,597
No stigmatic has ever received
the fuII five wounds.

650
01:05:09,764 --> 01:05:13,143
Have you ever met another person
who had stigmata?

651
01:05:13,309 --> 01:05:18,148
I did make a piIgrimage to a smaII viIIage
in the mountains of southern ItaIy.

652
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:20,608
There I met a priest caIIed Padre Pio.

653
01:05:20,775 --> 01:05:23,987
He first received the wounds
when he was 23 years of age,

654
01:05:24,154 --> 01:05:26,865
the same age as Saint Francis of Assisi.

655
01:05:27,031 --> 01:05:29,033
Who's Saint Francis of Assisi?

656
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,539
Saint Francis was the first person
to receive the stigmata, in the 1 3thC.

657
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:38,042
He was a wiId young man,
who suddenIy changed his ways

658
01:05:38,209 --> 01:05:42,213
after he'd had a vision
of being crucified aIongside Christ.

659
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:47,469
When he woke up, his hands
and his feet were... were bIeeding.

660
01:05:47,635 --> 01:05:50,764
This priest,
were his wounds as bad as mine?

661
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,515
Padre Pio.

662
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:57,812
Sometimes he Iost a pint of bIood a day.
And he suffered terribIe demonic attacks.

663
01:05:57,979 --> 01:05:59,022
A priest?

664
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:03,526
AII stigmatics suffer
the most intense spirituaI confIict.

665
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:05,653
The nearer they come to God,

666
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:09,616
the more open they are to temptation,
to eviI visions,

667
01:06:09,991 --> 01:06:12,827
to the torment of their demons.

668
01:06:12,994 --> 01:06:17,916
A smeII accompanies the wounds.
The odour of sanctity, the smeII of...

669
01:06:18,082 --> 01:06:19,042
FIowers?

670
01:06:19,209 --> 01:06:20,794
Yes.

671
01:06:21,586 --> 01:06:22,712
FIowers.

672
01:06:24,255 --> 01:06:26,257
WeII, what happened to him?

673
01:06:26,424 --> 01:06:28,843
How many wounds did he receive?

674
01:06:29,010 --> 01:06:31,012
He...

675
01:06:31,513 --> 01:06:34,057
He Iived to oId age.

676
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,893
How many wounds did he receive?

677
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:41,856
Two.

678
01:06:48,613 --> 01:06:50,615
I'm dying, aren't I?

679
01:06:53,535 --> 01:06:55,620
This thing is kiIIing me.

680
01:07:19,102 --> 01:07:21,020
Here's a cIoser shot.

681
01:07:21,187 --> 01:07:23,439
My guess is it's probablyAramaic.

682
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:24,816
Aspetta.

683
01:07:24,983 --> 01:07:26,985
I'm Iooking at it.

684
01:07:27,819 --> 01:07:30,321
ls there a... ls there a problem, Gianni?

685
01:07:30,488 --> 01:07:33,283
Yes. Don't send me any more pictures.

686
01:07:33,449 --> 01:07:35,785
- How many did you send?
- Six. Why?

687
01:07:35,952 --> 01:07:39,455
- The probIem is what it says.
- WeII, what does it say?

688
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:44,085
It says, ''The kingdom of God is
inside you, and aII about you.''

689
01:07:44,252 --> 01:07:46,212
Andrew, forget you saw this.

690
01:07:46,379 --> 01:07:49,924
- Drop it immediately.
- Gianni, what is the probIem?

691
01:07:50,091 --> 01:07:52,886
Do you remember the GospeIs...

692
01:07:54,387 --> 01:07:57,765
Gianni? Gianni, are you still there?

693
01:07:57,932 --> 01:08:00,393
Do you remember
the GospeIs Commission?

694
01:08:00,560 --> 01:08:03,938
lt was closed down suddenly
by your friend Cardinal Houseman.

695
01:08:04,105 --> 01:08:05,982
Yes, a few years ago, yes.

696
01:08:06,149 --> 01:08:09,736
We discovered a document that
looked like a completely new gospel.

697
01:08:09,903 --> 01:08:12,655
- What's the significance?
- l was one ofthe three

698
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:17,285
transIators of this gospeI.
It was written entireIy in Aramaic.

699
01:08:17,785 --> 01:08:20,747
The Ianguage of Jesus and his discipIes.

700
01:08:20,914 --> 01:08:22,999
It may be Jesus's actuaI words.

701
01:08:23,166 --> 01:08:24,292
He's...

702
01:08:25,376 --> 01:08:28,588
Where is it now?

703
01:08:29,422 --> 01:08:31,633
Gianni? What's going on?

704
01:08:31,799 --> 01:08:33,426
Are you there?

705
01:08:33,593 --> 01:08:34,385
Gianni?

706
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:41,643
Buona sera.

707
01:08:44,854 --> 01:08:46,439
What's this?

708
01:08:51,569 --> 01:08:53,571
Is that a painting?

709
01:08:53,738 --> 01:08:55,782
- No, it's a mirror.
- Who eIse was there?

710
01:08:55,949 --> 01:08:59,202
- I don't know.
- I thought you said it was just you two.

711
01:08:59,911 --> 01:09:01,913
16a. Do you have the neg?

712
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:06,668
Who is that?

713
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:14,509
I'II be back as soon as I can.

714
01:09:39,784 --> 01:09:42,370
- CardinaI Houseman.
- I'm Iate for a meeting.

715
01:09:42,537 --> 01:09:45,623
- I think this might be of interest.
- What is it?

716
01:09:51,004 --> 01:09:55,091
- Where did you get this?
- It was e-maiIed to Father DeImonico.

717
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:58,344
- By who?
- Father Kiernan in Pittsburgh.

718
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:01,681
- Do you know what it means?
- No.

719
01:10:01,848 --> 01:10:03,933
Is it important?

720
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,895
WiII you teII the meeting
I'II be with them in a few minutes?

721
01:10:12,859 --> 01:10:14,485
New York City

722
01:10:16,863 --> 01:10:18,323
Who is it?

723
01:10:18,489 --> 01:10:20,867
Don't hang up. Don't hang up.

724
01:10:21,034 --> 01:10:22,410
Who's this?

725
01:10:22,577 --> 01:10:24,078
It's an oId friend.

726
01:10:24,245 --> 01:10:28,541
- DeImonico? What's happened?
- The missing Jesus gospeI... It turned up.

727
01:10:28,708 --> 01:10:30,084
That's impossibIe.

728
01:10:30,251 --> 01:10:31,085
AIameida...

729
01:10:31,252 --> 01:10:32,587
AIameida?

730
01:10:32,754 --> 01:10:34,839
In the United States. Pittsburgh.

731
01:10:35,006 --> 01:10:36,215
Send me something.

732
01:10:36,382 --> 01:10:38,384
No. No, I can't.

733
01:10:38,551 --> 01:10:40,553
Houseman wiII kiII me.

734
01:11:00,114 --> 01:11:03,159
Hi, come in. The door's open.

735
01:11:10,833 --> 01:11:12,085
Frankie?

736
01:11:12,251 --> 01:11:14,253
I'm in here!

737
01:11:20,051 --> 01:11:22,720
How you doin'? Want a beer?

738
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:24,514
Sure.

739
01:11:29,519 --> 01:11:34,107
- Check these out. They're getting better.
- That's great.

740
01:11:35,566 --> 01:11:36,776
ReaIIy good.

741
01:11:36,943 --> 01:11:39,737
You'II be abIe to get
these stitches out soon.

742
01:11:39,904 --> 01:11:41,906
That's great.

743
01:11:42,073 --> 01:11:44,075
Let me see your forehead.

744
01:11:46,327 --> 01:11:49,080
- Does this... Does this hurt?
- No.

745
01:11:50,706 --> 01:11:52,417
Great. You'II...

746
01:12:17,692 --> 01:12:19,735
Why did you paint over the waII?

747
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:22,864
I got bored, and I got sick
of Iooking at that thing.

748
01:13:01,152 --> 01:13:04,822
I reaIIy wish you weren't wearing
that uniform right now.

749
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,366
It's got nothing to do with the uniform.

750
01:13:07,533 --> 01:13:10,786
WeII, what is it? You took a vow
to be dead from the neck down?

751
01:13:12,914 --> 01:13:14,582
Come on!

752
01:13:14,749 --> 01:13:19,253
I've seen the way you Iook at me.
You know the way that I feeI about you.

753
01:13:19,754 --> 01:13:22,632
Come on, I'm not bIind. It's OK.

754
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:23,883
No.

755
01:13:24,717 --> 01:13:28,387
Why, because I...
I painted the waII out? Is that it?

756
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:31,516
So now I'm no use to you, right? Is that it?

757
01:13:31,682 --> 01:13:34,143
Answer me!

758
01:13:35,102 --> 01:13:39,607
You are so proud of your hoIy abstinence!

759
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:43,528
Like touching a woman wouId kiII you!

760
01:13:43,694 --> 01:13:46,864
Women are dirty IittIe compIications!

761
01:13:49,951 --> 01:13:51,953
That's why you became a priest.

762
01:13:52,119 --> 01:13:55,998
It has nothing to do
with your convenient IittIe stories!

763
01:14:01,379 --> 01:14:04,507
Oh, you're so proud of your church,

764
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:07,468
of virgins and eunuchs!

765
01:14:37,707 --> 01:14:41,460
How's your faith these days, Father?

766
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:44,046
How's your faith these days?!

767
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:47,091
This is what you fucking caII God?

768
01:14:50,678 --> 01:14:52,513
BIood of Christ!

769
01:18:08,584 --> 01:18:13,172
- I've never seen you pray before.
- I haven't prayed for a very Iong time.

770
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:17,218
Come here.

771
01:18:19,261 --> 01:18:21,680
It's OK. Come on.

772
01:19:25,578 --> 01:19:27,580
Go in.

773
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:45,014
- DanieI.
- We've come to heIp.

774
01:19:46,307 --> 01:19:48,684
Take her to the archdiocese.

775
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:11,457
I'II be downstairs if you need me, Sister.

776
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,215
Where did you get this from, hm?
What does it mean?

777
01:20:20,382 --> 01:20:23,260
The girI wrote it.
I don't know what it means.

778
01:20:23,427 --> 01:20:25,429
Neither does she.

779
01:20:25,638 --> 01:20:27,598
Why was it painted over?

780
01:20:27,765 --> 01:20:31,185
- What Ianguage is it in?
- It's Aramaic.

781
01:20:31,352 --> 01:20:33,812
How do you know that?

782
01:20:33,979 --> 01:20:36,482
- That's irreIevant.
- What I don't understand

783
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:39,985
is why you wouId send this
to anyone other than me.

784
01:20:40,152 --> 01:20:42,613
- What are you hiding?
- AII I know is

785
01:20:42,780 --> 01:20:45,157
that the girI is fighting for her Iife.

786
01:20:45,324 --> 01:20:49,370
If she receives another wound
she's going to die unIess we heIp her.

787
01:20:49,536 --> 01:20:51,497
Right. I'm taking over.

788
01:20:51,664 --> 01:20:54,041
- Get some rest.
- I'm not Ieaving her aIone.

789
01:20:54,208 --> 01:20:56,710
You're Ieaving her
in the care of the sisters.

790
01:20:56,877 --> 01:20:59,296
You sent me here.
I didn't want to come.

791
01:20:59,463 --> 01:21:02,299
You toId me to deaI with her.
That's what I'm doing!

792
01:21:02,466 --> 01:21:05,135
She's in no condition
to take on you orthe Church.

793
01:21:05,260 --> 01:21:08,430
This is not about a girI
taking on me or taking on the Church!

794
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:12,351
Why are you more concerned
about photographs than a girI dying?

795
01:21:12,518 --> 01:21:16,188
- Andrew, where's your IoyaIty?
- Don't you Iecture me about IoyaIty.

796
01:21:16,355 --> 01:21:19,483
The onIy reason
you've been toIerated for so Iong

797
01:21:19,650 --> 01:21:22,027
is because you were a good scientist.

798
01:21:22,194 --> 01:21:25,155
Because of your objectivity.
WeII, you've Iost that.

799
01:21:25,322 --> 01:21:29,993
The Iast thing I expected to see in
that girI's apartment was the two of you

800
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,371
- Iying on a bed together.
- Oh, come on!

801
01:21:32,538 --> 01:21:36,208
You think you're heIping her,
but you're not. She's getting worse.

802
01:21:36,375 --> 01:21:41,547
Andrew, you're in no state to heIp anyone
right now. You're exhausted.

803
01:21:41,714 --> 01:21:45,384
Go to Father Durning's. Get some rest.
We'II taIk about it tomorrow.

804
01:21:45,551 --> 01:21:48,470
Why are you so concerned
with these photographs?

805
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:51,640
Father DeImonico seemed to think
they were important.

806
01:21:51,807 --> 01:21:55,477
- What do they mean?
- We've no idea, but we're working on it.

807
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:59,481
- Is it to do with the GospeI Commission?
- We don't know.

808
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:01,650
Good night, Andrew.

809
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:34,349
Andrew Kiernan?

810
01:22:36,393 --> 01:22:38,896
- I'm Kiernan.
- I want to see AIameida.

811
01:22:39,063 --> 01:22:40,606
I don't know any AIameida.

812
01:22:40,773 --> 01:22:44,359
DeImonico faxed me this copy
of his document.

813
01:22:44,526 --> 01:22:47,488
The girI wrote this. I saw her do it.
What is this?

814
01:22:47,654 --> 01:22:52,242
It's maybe the most significant
Christian reIic ever found.

815
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:53,660
Why?

816
01:22:53,827 --> 01:22:57,039
It's an Aramaic scroII
from the first century,

817
01:22:57,206 --> 01:23:02,336
discovered near the caves of the
Dead Sea ScroIIs, outside JerusaIem.

818
01:23:02,503 --> 01:23:04,922
AIameida and I concIuded that

819
01:23:05,923 --> 01:23:09,635
it is a gospeI... of Jesus Christ,

820
01:23:09,802 --> 01:23:12,596
in his own words... Aramaic.

821
01:23:12,763 --> 01:23:17,476
But there are some factions in the Vatican
who beIieve that this document

822
01:23:17,643 --> 01:23:21,021
couId destroy the authority
of the modern Church.

823
01:23:21,188 --> 01:23:22,773
How?

824
01:23:24,191 --> 01:23:28,487
It was Jesus' words to his discipIes
on the night of his Last Supper.

825
01:23:28,654 --> 01:23:34,576
His instructions to them on how to
continue his church after his death.

826
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:37,287
Why wouId that be so... so threatening?

827
01:23:37,454 --> 01:23:41,208
When we gave our initiaI concIusions
to the GospeI Commission,

828
01:23:41,375 --> 01:23:44,044
Houseman ordered us
to stop immediateIy.

829
01:23:44,211 --> 01:23:47,005
AIameida refused.
He stoIe the document and disappeared.

830
01:23:47,172 --> 01:23:49,842
Houseman excommunicated us
in our absence.

831
01:23:50,008 --> 01:23:52,052
You have no idea where he is?

832
01:23:52,219 --> 01:23:56,765
He doesn't want to be caught
untiI he finishes the transIation.

833
01:23:56,932 --> 01:23:59,101
I'II show you this guy.

834
01:23:59,268 --> 01:24:03,605
That's DeImonico, me and AIameida.
We were aII transIating the new gospeI.

835
01:24:03,772 --> 01:24:07,526
I've seen this man.
Three weeks ago, in BraziI.

836
01:24:07,693 --> 01:24:09,653
- Yeah?
- He's dead.

837
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,196
How do you know this?

838
01:24:11,363 --> 01:24:15,701
Because I saw him in his coffin
in a church in BeIo Quinto. I'm sorry.

839
01:24:18,912 --> 01:24:22,249
Then it's aII over. It's gone for ever.

840
01:24:22,457 --> 01:24:25,043
Why was your work stopped?

841
01:24:25,210 --> 01:24:27,796
What was so threatening
about this gospeI?

842
01:24:27,963 --> 01:24:31,592
- Look around you. What do you see?
- I see a church.

843
01:24:31,758 --> 01:24:33,302
It's a buiIding.

844
01:24:33,468 --> 01:24:37,181
The true church of Jesus Christ
is so much more.

845
01:24:37,347 --> 01:24:40,058
Not in buiIdings made of wood and stone.

846
01:24:40,225 --> 01:24:41,977
I love Jesus!

847
01:24:42,144 --> 01:24:45,230
I don't need an institution
between him and me.

848
01:24:45,397 --> 01:24:47,524
You see, just God and man.

849
01:24:47,691 --> 01:24:49,818
No priests, no churches.

850
01:24:49,985 --> 01:24:53,197
The first words in Jesus' gospeI are,

851
01:24:53,363 --> 01:24:56,992
''The kingdom of God is inside you,

852
01:24:57,159 --> 01:24:59,828
and aII around you.''

853
01:24:59,995 --> 01:25:03,457
''Not in buiIdings of wood and stone.''

854
01:25:03,624 --> 01:25:06,710
''SpIit a piece of wood and I am there.''

855
01:25:06,877 --> 01:25:09,922
- ''Lift a stone and...
- ..you wiII find me.''

856
01:25:10,088 --> 01:25:12,049
Yes, brother.

857
01:25:14,968 --> 01:25:18,889
Why is Father AIameida wearing gIoves?

858
01:25:19,056 --> 01:25:20,974
AIameida was a tormented man.

859
01:25:21,141 --> 01:25:23,810
HoIy man. A very hoIy man.

860
01:25:23,977 --> 01:25:28,649
He wore the gIoves
to cover the marks of the stigmata.

861
01:25:33,946 --> 01:25:35,906
She has the stigmata.

862
01:25:36,073 --> 01:25:38,075
That's why.

863
01:25:40,827 --> 01:25:42,829
She's just his messenger.

864
01:25:43,538 --> 01:25:46,208
Houseman wiII never Iet
this gospeI get out.

865
01:25:48,627 --> 01:25:51,213
AImighty God,
bIess your humbIe servant,

866
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:54,216
guide me with your HoIy Spirit,
and forgive me

867
01:25:54,383 --> 01:25:57,928
for I have sinned exceedingIy
in thought, word and deed.

868
01:26:18,490 --> 01:26:20,492
My sins deserve your punishments

869
01:26:20,659 --> 01:26:24,288
because they have crucified
my Ioving Saviour, Jesus Christ.

870
01:26:24,454 --> 01:26:26,415
Amen.

871
01:26:56,945 --> 01:26:57,904
Lord,

872
01:26:58,071 --> 01:27:01,033
do not remember our sins,
or those of our forefathers.

873
01:27:01,199 --> 01:27:04,202
- Where's Andrew?
- And do not punish us for our offences.

874
01:27:04,369 --> 01:27:07,039
Lead us not into temptation.

875
01:27:07,205 --> 01:27:09,708
Save this woman, your servant.

876
01:27:09,875 --> 01:27:12,878
Spirit of Iust,
by the power of Jesus Christ

877
01:27:13,045 --> 01:27:16,340
I command you, come out of her body
now and for aIways.

878
01:27:16,506 --> 01:27:18,550
In the name of Jesus Christ
I command you

879
01:27:18,717 --> 01:27:20,886
come out of her body now
and for aIways.

880
01:27:22,429 --> 01:27:23,638
In the name of Jesus Christ...

881
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:26,141
You are bIind men.

882
01:27:26,308 --> 01:27:27,893
Your eyes are open.

883
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:29,644
But you see nothing.

884
01:27:31,229 --> 01:27:34,107
Why do you persecute me?!

885
01:27:34,274 --> 01:27:37,027
Send her heIp
from the hoIy pIace, O Lord!

886
01:27:40,655 --> 01:27:44,076
Lord, hear my prayer!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

887
01:27:44,242 --> 01:27:45,827
BehoId

888
01:27:46,078 --> 01:27:47,329
your servant,

889
01:27:47,496 --> 01:27:49,498
dripping with bIood!

890
01:27:54,377 --> 01:27:56,463
Embrace me, my chiId. I am the Church.

891
01:27:56,630 --> 01:27:59,841
You are the true enemy
of the Church, Houseman.

892
01:28:00,425 --> 01:28:01,385
I am the Church.

893
01:28:01,551 --> 01:28:03,553
- Stop!
- Get away from me!

894
01:28:05,305 --> 01:28:08,100
Get them out of here!
Get out of here! Get out!

895
01:28:08,934 --> 01:28:11,269
- Eminenza!
- Get out!

896
01:28:13,146 --> 01:28:15,232
Save this woman from woe. O Lord,

897
01:28:15,399 --> 01:28:17,943
save this woman, your servant.

898
01:28:23,115 --> 01:28:25,450
Send her heIp
from the hoIy pIace, O Lord.

899
01:28:25,617 --> 01:28:28,412
Give her heavenIy protection.

900
01:28:32,165 --> 01:28:35,544
Save this woman, O Lord!
Let the enemy have no victory over her!

901
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:43,260
Send her heIp from the hoIy pIace.

902
01:28:47,514 --> 01:28:48,640
Frankie!

903
01:28:48,807 --> 01:28:51,518
You wiII not destroy my Church.

904
01:29:00,777 --> 01:29:01,987
Frankie!

905
01:29:03,196 --> 01:29:05,157
You must not interrupt.

906
01:29:06,032 --> 01:29:08,743
What are you doing?! Get away from her!

907
01:29:08,910 --> 01:29:11,705
- Get away from her!
- No! No!

908
01:29:11,872 --> 01:29:13,874
Get away!

909
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:18,044
It's aII right. I know what...

910
01:29:18,211 --> 01:29:19,588
Andrew!

911
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:21,965
Get away from her!
You don't know what's going on here!

912
01:29:22,132 --> 01:29:24,801
You get off me! You Iied to me!

913
01:29:24,968 --> 01:29:28,722
You tried to siIence her.
You Iied to me, you bastard!

914
01:29:29,514 --> 01:29:32,100
- Andrew...
- You tried to kiII her!

915
01:29:33,435 --> 01:29:37,647
I know everything. I know why you
cIosed down the GospeI Commission,

916
01:29:37,814 --> 01:29:40,942
why you had PetroceIIi
and AIameida excommunicated,

917
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:43,945
aII about the Iies
you've been teIIing for years.

918
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:46,406
You won't get away with
what you did to her!

919
01:29:46,573 --> 01:29:48,867
I wiII not Iet you destroy the Church.

920
01:29:51,244 --> 01:29:54,831
I promise you,
you've spent your Iast days in the Church.

921
01:30:09,054 --> 01:30:11,723
