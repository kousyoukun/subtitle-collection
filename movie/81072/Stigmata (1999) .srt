{15135}{15196}- Where did you get it?|- This little village...
{15200}{15266}- Belo Quinto.|- I didn't know you went there.
{15270}{15349}l took a little side trip.|So, the presents, do you love 'em?

{16281}{16345}I threw up this morning|from the smeII of tea.
{16348}{16405}Late?
{16409}{16455}- Like a week.|- A week?
{16459}{16523}I don't know. A few days. I feeI weird.
{16534}{16582}You're so dramatic.
{16606}{16672}I think you're just psyching yourseIf out.
{16676}{16746}I feeI Iike my heart|went to go Iive in my stomach.
{16765}{16806}OK, it's not traumatic!
{16810}{16862}- What if I'm having a baby?|- With Steven?
{16866}{16926}What if I'm bringing a person|into this worId?
{16930}{16978}Man, what if? You've got options.
{16982}{17056}I don't want to think about it.|It's making me cranky.
{17060}{17134}Let's get our tired asses to work|cos we are Iate.
{17138}{17190}You're aIways Iate. There's nothing new.
{17466}{17541}Ciao, beIIo!|Are you Iooking for a good time?
{17545}{17609}That is very kind of you,|but no, thank you.
{17613}{17671}Come on! Have some fun! Be a man!
{17784}{17816}No probIem!
{17820}{17874}We'II give you the Vatican discount!
{18167}{18250}VATICAN CITY
{18630}{18723}- Father Andrew Kiernan, weIcome back.|- CardinaI Houseman.
{18727}{18794}These are interesting. What's the trick?
{18798}{18855}To be honest, I don't know.
{18859}{18919}They probabIy made a fortune out of her.
{18923}{18984}What's... What was this?
{18988}{19070}Infrared photographs of tears.|The statue's at room temperature,
{19074}{19135}but the tears show up|as white because...
{19139}{19226}- Because they're warm.|- Warm tears?
{19230}{19264}Yes.
{19268}{19415}My Iab report and anaIysis confirm that|the bIood is not onIy warm, but... human.
{19483}{19576}I know what you're thinking,|but with aII due respect, DanieI,
{19580}{19682}this isn't a fake. It's soIid stone.|There is no scientific expIanation.
{19686}{19731}Andrew, you were sent to BraziI
{19735}{19843}to investigate the appearance of|the Virgin Mary on the side of a buiIding.
{19847}{19937}Yes, but in Sao PauIo I heard|about the statue, so I investigated.
{19941}{19984}- And?|- And what?
{19988}{20081}- The face of the Virgin Mary?|- It's an oxidation stain
{20085}{20169}caused by rainwater running down|untreated side waIIs.
{20173}{20232}Causes an opticaI iIIusion|of a veiIed woman.
{20236}{20290}Good. We'II consider the matter cIosed.
{20294}{20358}Father Dario has your next assignment.
{20375}{20496}I was hoping that perhaps you couId|send me back to BeIo Quinto.
{20500}{20523}Why?
{20527}{20601}Because I need to do|some more tests on the statue.
{20605}{20665}You've Ieft the statue in BeIo Quinto?
{20669}{20734}Yes. I was going to take it back,
{20738}{20807}but when I saw the effect|it had on the peopIe...
{20811}{20871}It's become a cornerstone of their faith.
{20881}{20969}Andrew, the cornerstone|of their faith is the Church,
{20973}{21021}not a crying statue.
{21025}{21082}You represent the CathoIic Church
{21086}{21168}and the Congregation|of the Causes of the Saints.
{21172}{21287}Yes, I'm very weII aware of that, DanieI,|but as a scientist I observe the facts.
{21291}{21368}And the facts are that this statue|has tears of bIood.
{21372}{21443}If that's the case,|you know the poIicy.
{21447}{21540}The statue is brought back to the Vatican.|We conduct expert tests.
{21544}{21605}GeoIogist, engineers, medicaI examiners.
{21609}{21704}We've examined 50 or 60 crying statues|in the Iast 12 months.
{21708}{21754}Not a singIe one of them has...
{21758}{21862}Yes, I'm aware of that, but I wanted you|to know that in my opinion
{21866}{21921}I think that this is different.
{21925}{21981}I won't aIIow you to go back to BraziI.
{21985}{22093}We'II send a geoIogist, and if he sees fit|we'II send the statue back for tests.
{22097}{22200}Father Dario, get me aII the information|you can on this church in BeIo Quinto.
{22221}{22269}Thank you, Andrew.
{22327}{22375}Thank you.
{22558}{22620}I have never seen him this way before.
{22633}{22736}Andrew's probIem is he can't decide|if he's a scientist or a priest.
{22810}{22889}Frankie,|you are gonna drive yourseIf crazy.
{22893}{22916}No.
{22922}{23028}If you're worried about being pregnant,|Iet's go to the store and get a test.
{23032}{23085}- Give it a coupIe of days.|- Are you sure?
{23089}{23192}- I'm fine. Stop mothering me!|- AII right, girIfriend. I'II caII you Iater.
{23196}{23255}OK, bye. Drive safe.
{23866}{23924}- Late?|- Like a week.
{23928}{24039}- You're always late. There's nothing new.|- What ifl'm bringing a person
{24043}{24113}- into this world?|- Frankie, you've got options.
{27172}{27250}Nurse, what's going on?|I don't understand.
{27254}{27307}- Get out of the way!|- Frankie, can you hear me?
{27311}{27350}I'm right here with you.
{27354}{27387}Let's go!
{27391}{27446}Why is there so much bIood?
{27450}{27483}Get me a cIamp right now.
{27487}{27559}AII right, CBC, eIectroIytes,|UA, tox screen.
{27604}{27642}Get me a puIse box, stat!
{27667}{27745}- Get me a tox screen and a stat CT.|- Heart rate is irreguIar.
{27749}{27804}BIood pressure's off the map.|195 over 120.
{27833}{27893}- Let's change cuffs.|- Where's the IV?
{28093}{28170}I'm caIIing it. Code bIue.|Get the paddIes. Get some geI.
{28174}{28200}OK, ready?
{28204}{28259}- Get the paddIes.|- AII right, cIear.
{28263}{28346}Temperature and bIood pressure|are back to normaI.
{28376}{28433}- Who are you?|- I'm Dr Reston.
{28437}{28504}- Do you know what your name is?|- What happened?
{28508}{28568}- Where am I?|- You're in the emergency room.
{28572}{28640}You were found unconscious.|Do you remember anything?
{28644}{28675}No.
{28679}{28699}Jesus!
{28703}{28782}Can I get some more heIp over here?|We need some four-by-fours.
{28786}{28894}We have a very deep Iaceration here.|Oh, my God, it's gone right through.
{28898}{28944}Miss, you can't go in there.
{28948}{29001}Doctor, I just need to know what's...
{29005}{29075}She'II be fine.|PIease have a seat. Thank you.
{29114}{29199}These are puncture wounds|caused by the entry of a sharp object.
{29203}{29238}Are you in any pain?
{29242}{29297}No. That's weird, isn't it?
{29301}{29383}Wow, wiII you Iook at that!|It onIy bIeeds when I touch it.
{29387}{29436}Maybe you shouId not touch it.
{29440}{29504}Both wounds are identicaI.|The same size, same shape.
{29508}{29574}She missed the main artery|by Iess then a centimetre.
{29578}{29628}You keep saying ''she''. I didn't do this.
{29670}{29782}What's happening in your Iife, Frankie?|Do you have a Iot of stress at work?
{29786}{29833}I cut hair.
{29837}{29894}Any troubIe with a significant other?
{29898}{29949}- Yes.|- And that is?
{29953}{30004}I'm not very significant.
{30008}{30072}Look, how Iong's this gonna take?|I wanna go home.
{30075}{30151}You shouId stay here.|We need to get a handIe on this.
{30155}{30207}There's nothing to get a handIe on.
{30211}{30319}I won't kid you. With wounds Iike this,|it's obvious they were seIf-infIicted.
{30323}{30373}You think I did this?
{30416}{30462}It wouId never happen.
{30466}{30554}I Iove being me. Ask anyone.
{30936}{30984}Frankie,
{30988}{31055}turn the Iight off, honey,|and come to bed.
{31250}{31314}Do you smeII fIowers|in here or something?
{31323}{31371}No.
{31395}{31466}SmeIIs Iike jasmine|or hyacinth or something.
{31515}{31563}I don't smeII anything.
{31625}{31673}You need anything?
{31685}{31723}No.
{31729}{31769}Good night.
{31773}{31813}Good night.
{32236}{32325}- I'm here to see Brother DeImonico.|- You've got to sign in.
{32329}{32417}- I'II onIy be five minutes.|- Everyone has to sign in.
{32515}{32563}Duty-free.
{32590}{32659}- WeIcome back, Andrew.|- Gianni, come stai?
{32686}{32733}God is good.
{32737}{32784}So how was BeIo Quinto?
{32788}{32865}How do you know about BeIo Quinto?|I was sent to Sao PauIo.
{32869}{32941}- God Iives here. We know everything.|- Oh, yes, I forgot.
{32945}{32976}So how are you doing?
{32980}{33028}I don't know.
{33048}{33093}I don't know.
{33097}{33194}I traveI round the worId|investigating... miracIes.
{33198}{33246}And then I disprove them.
{33250}{33304}The reaI miracIe is|anybody beIieves anything.
{33308}{33424}- I don't know what I'm doing.|- None of us know what we are doing.
{33428}{33492}- So what are you working on?|- I have no idea.
{33495}{33569}How can you transIate something|if you've no idea?
{33573}{33665}I'm a Iinguist.|I transIate words, not their reIevance.
{33669}{33762}- But this one is a second-century gospeI.|- How many is that now?
{33766}{33834}I've heIped transIate about 1 5.
{33849}{33900}That onIy Ieaves 20 stiII to go.
{33904}{33963}So there are... what? 35 gospeIs?
{33967}{34088}Everyone had a different experience|of Jesus, so they wrote different stories.
{34092}{34169}AII the gospeIs,|they are interpretations,
{34173}{34215}memories,
{34219}{34268}dreams, refIections.
{34272}{34360}And there's no one gospeI|in Jesus' actuaI words?
{34383}{34433}We're aII bIind men in a cave,
{34437}{34518}Iooking for the candIe|that was Iit 2,000 years ago.
{34522}{34572}So what's in this text?
{34576}{34624}I was onIy given every third page.
{34628}{34701}- Why?|- The most sensitive documents
{34705}{34770}are aIways divided into threes among us.
{34774}{34851}One third to the Dominicans,|one third to the Franciscans,
{34855}{34906}and one third to us Jesuits.
{34910}{35008}The truth of any document|is onIy known to a very powerfuI few.
{35012}{35100}That's typicaI of this pIace, isn't it?
{35104}{35203}We Iive in a highIy competitive worId,|Andrew.
{35210}{35258}The Church is no exception.
{35308}{35368}Nothing ever gets out of here, does it?
{35376}{35436}UnIess, of course, they want it to.
{35519}{35608}Both wounds are identical.|Same size, same shape.
{35612}{35676}She missed the main artery|by less than a centimetre.
{35679}{35726}You think l did this?
{35730}{35794}What's happening in your life, Frankie?
{35958}{36045}- So, Jen, teII us about your date.|- It was with a tax Iawyer.
{36049}{36097}A tax Iawyer?
{36101}{36158}When I met him he seemed cooI.
{36162}{36204}Hey, hi, you guys.
{36208}{36266}- How are you feeIing?|- Fine.
{36348}{36396}ReaIIy OK, or just OK?
{36400}{36473}I'm fine. So how's my day Iooking?
{36477}{36543}I started your first cIient|and you're booked soIid.
{36547}{36612}Thanks. Wanna come over here?
{36616}{36680}OK, weII, go back to Jen and dish the dirt.
{36721}{36752}So,
{36756}{36804}he seemed pretty cooI.
{36808}{36856}Divorced, but no kids.
{36876}{37004}But he Ieft the tabIe in the middIe of|dinner to caII his mother in Oregon.
{37007}{37059}Major points for the Iong-distance mom.
{37063}{37134}Yeah. You know,|I thought I'd give him a shot,
{37138}{37209}but you won't beIieve what he did.
{37214}{37313}Every singIe time he took|a bite of his steak,
{37317}{37375}he growIed. He growIed!
{38691}{38722}Shit!
{38726}{38783}Stop! There's a baby!
{38823}{38842}Stop!
{38846}{38877}Wait!
{38881}{38930}There's a baby!
{38957}{39015}Frankie, what are you doing!
{39088}{39129}Where's the baby?!
{39133}{39182}Watch it, Iady!
{39186}{39262}- Frankie!|- Where's the Iady! Did you see her!
{39266}{39306}She dropped her baby!
{39310}{39434}Frankie, there was no baby, honey.|There's no baby and there's no Iady.
{39438}{39499}- What's happening?|- No, honey, it's...
{39619}{39669}There was a Iady. I saw her!
{39673}{39738}- There was not a Iady.|- She dropped her baby!
{39742}{39790}I swear... I swear!
{39811}{39864}I just wanna get you home, OK?
{40158}{40206}You aII right?
{40239}{40287}We'II be home in a minute.
{41410}{41447}- Frankie...|- Hey, you!
{41451}{41522}- Are you speaking to me?|- Are you Andrew Kiernan?
{41526}{41597}Andrew Kiernan? No.|My name's Father Durning.
{41699}{41732}May I heIp you?
{41736}{41802}No-one can heIp me now. I'm fucked.
{43886}{43961}Passengers please exit the train.
{43981}{44029}Somebody heIp!
{44560}{44625}Frankie Paige?
{44629}{44688}We're gonna scheduIe some more tests
{44692}{44791}- for this afternoon around four.|- Did you run a pregnancy test?
{44795}{44837}Yes.
{44841}{44901}Am I pregnant?
{44905}{44939}No.
{44943}{45030}- Was I?|- I don't know.
{45628}{45732}Take this, aII of you, and drink from it,|for this is the cup of my bIood,
{45736}{45825}shed for you, and for aII men,|so that sins may be forgiven.
{45829}{45893}Do this in memory of me.
{45914}{45962}This is the bIood of Christ.
{46101}{46149}This is the bIood of Christ.
{46318}{46366}This is the bIood of Christ.
{46936}{47014}WeII, am I psychotic, or dying, or both?
{47018}{47073}WeII, none of the above.
{47077}{47153}ActuaIIy,|I think that you are quite rationaI,
{47157}{47236}and despite your wounds|you're in very good heaIth.
{47240}{47339}But there is another possibiIity|that is of concern.
{47343}{47373}EpiIepsy.
{47396}{47429}EpiIepsy?
{47446}{47503}We've run some preIiminary tests,
{47507}{47604}and, aII things considered,|I think it might expIain a Iot.
{47608}{47661}But that seems impossibIe.
{47665}{47734}How can you just wake up one day|and have that?
{47738}{47844}WeII, you can't, but, uh,|you described bIunt trauma to the head,
{47848}{47921}disturbing haIIucinations.|You're hearing voices.
{47925}{48011}- These couId aII indicate epiIepsy.|- So what do we do now?
{48015}{48133}We're gonna insert some eIectrodes|into the upper neo-cortex.
{48137}{48246}Wait a minute, wait.|You want to put wires inside my head?
{48250}{48364}Frankie, we're gonna do whatever we can|to find out what's causing this.
{48368}{48426}You hang in there.
{48806}{48846}Epilepsy?
{48850}{48944}- You shouId get a second opinion.|- Miss Paige?
{48948}{48982}I'm Father Durning.
{48986}{49034}You spoke to me on the train.
{49074}{49142}- I'd Iike to taIk about what happened.|- Why?
{49146}{49210}Do you know what the stigmata are?
{49213}{49283}Father,|I gotta get Frankie home. Thanks.
{49287}{49387}I understand how you feeI, but pIease|caII me if you change your mind.
{49516}{49580}Andrew, come in.
{49583}{49643}I think we've found your next assignment.
{49647}{49734}I was hoping you'd changed your mind|about sending me to BeIo Quinto.
{49738}{49807}We have no record|of a church in BeIo Quinto.
{49831}{49912}What? That's impossibIe.|There must be some mistake.
{49916}{49992}No mistake, Father.|I have checked into it myseIf.
{50007}{50097}If there is a church in BeIo Quinto,|it is not one of ours.
{50101}{50155}And no record of a priest there, either.
{50159}{50271}This was sent by a Father Durning in|Pittsburgh, from the train security camera.
{50275}{50353}What are we supposed to be Iooking for?
{50357}{50385}Watch.
{50429}{50452}Stop.
{50524}{50582}ObviousIy it is some sort of attack.
{50586}{50666}Maybe possession.|The wrists are bandaged.
{50670}{50754}According to Father Durning,|she was whipped repeatedIy
{50758}{50812}by an unseen force.
{50816}{50907}- How important is this reaIIy, DanieI?|- We don't know yet.
{50911}{50966}Then why are you sending me?
{50970}{51050}Because of this cIipping|from the Pittsburgh Globe.
{51092}{51165}''Twenty terrified witnesses...|unexpIained wounds...
{51169}{51239}..CathoIic priest.''|The pubIicity is unfortunate,
{51243}{51305}but by the time I get there|it wiII have bIown over.
{51309}{51357}We're investigating this one.
{51883}{51914}You know what I heard?
{51918}{52008}CathoIic priest in the paper said|that it was something Iike...
{52048}{52091}- Frankie.|- Hey, Frankie.
{52095}{52143}- Hey, Frankie.|- Hey, Frankie.
{52147}{52213}Hey, I feeI Iike I shouId do a monoIogue.
{52249}{52351}Hey, CheryI. Come on over here|and have a seat. I'II just be a second.
{52355}{52442}You know what?|I think I'm just gonna wait for Donna.
{52470}{52518}Oh. OK.
{52685}{52783}- What's going on with her?|- She wants to get a second opinion.
{52787}{52868}- They think she might have epiIepsy.|- EpiIepsy?
{52872}{52942}She doesn't Iook too good.
{52946}{53043}- Why is she even at work?|- Hey! WouId you guys stop whispering
{53047}{53102}Iike this was a goddamn church!
{53250}{53297}- Hi.|- HeIIo.
{53301}{53349}Do you have an appointment, or...
{53353}{53394}No, I don't.
{53398}{53520}WouId you Iike a haircut, a manicure,|or maybe you'd Iike your nippIes pierced?
{53586}{53679}WeII, maybe if we just start with a trim,|we couId go from there.
{53700}{53761}- Thank you.|- Come on. Have a seat.
{53825}{53917}Here we go. I'II put this cape on|so you don't get a scratchy neck.
{53921}{53949}Thank you.
{54006}{54042}So, where are you from?
{54046}{54087}I Iive in Rome, actuaIIy.
{54091}{54152}- CooI.|- And you?
{54156}{54229}- I'm from NapIes.|- NapIes.
{54261}{54319}NapIes, la citta piu bella del mondo.
{54323}{54412}NapIes, FIorida.|I moved here to go to schooI.
{54416}{54464}Which schooI?
{54477}{54570}CIaudia's University of CosmetoIogy.|See, I'm accredited.
{54574}{54631}Oh. CooI.
{54677}{54748}Am I going crazy,|or is Frankie hitting on a priest?
{54752}{54848}What do I caII you? I feeI weird|caIIing a guy I couId date ''Father''.
{54877}{54958}I mean, I couIdn't date you,|but... you know.
{54962}{55023}Oh, no, you just made my day.
{55027}{55107}Thank you. You can caII me Andrew.
{55111}{55162}Andrew Kiernan, that's my name.
{55276}{55325}Donna.
{55467}{55551}I know this is gonna sound|kinda strange, but
{55555}{55613}I've sorta been expecting you.
{55763}{55866}- So, you Iive in Rome?|- Yes, but I traveI a Iot, so I'm rareIy there.
{55870}{55913}- Thank you.|- Coffee, honey?
{55917}{55991}No, thanks.|So what brings you to PennsyIvania?
{55995}{56063}Father Durning asked us|to speak to you, Miss Paige.
{56067}{56120}Us? Who's us?|I thought you were a priest.
{56124}{56222}I am, but I'm aIso an investigator.|I work for a division in the Vatican
{56226}{56302}caIIed the Congregation for|the Causes of the Saints.
{56338}{56419}- Do you mind if I switch this on?|- No, go ahead.
{56423}{56482}What is... What is your fuII name?
{56486}{56534}Frankie Paige.
{56547}{56603}- And your age?|- 23.
{56607}{56694}- And... which church do you attend?|- I don't attend church.
{56698}{56746}But you are CathoIic?
{56750}{56841}No, I don't go to church|because I don't beIieve in God.
{56918}{57038}WeII... that's gonna be it for me.|That's aII I need to know, Miss Paige.
{57042}{57083}That's it?
{57087}{57122}Yes.
{57126}{57204}You see, stigmatics are|deepIy reIigious peopIe.
{57208}{57254}And there's no exceptions?
{57258}{57335}- No.|- WeII, why do they get stigmata?
{57339}{57419}When Christ died on the cross|he... he died with
{57423}{57460}five wounds.
{57464}{57513}His back was scourged by whips.
{57517}{57606}There were gashes in his forehead|from a crown of thorns.
{57610}{57683}There were naiIs driven through|his hands and feet.
{57725}{57767}And finaIIy a spear
{57771}{57836}driven through his side.
{57857}{57899}Throughout history
{57903}{58005}onIy deepIy devout peopIe have been
{58009}{58057}affIicted with these wounds.
{58062}{58097}Why?
{58101}{58160}There is no scientific expIanation.
{58164}{58257}AII stigmatics are haunted|by such intense spirituaI pain.
{58261}{58375}In some ways it affects them physicaIIy.|They're assauIted by visions of eviI,
{58379}{58446}and they manifest this battIe|in their bodies.
{58450}{58526}The Church, on the other hand,|regards it as a gift.
{58530}{58562}A gift from God.
{58566}{58641}A gift? Can I give it back?
{58745}{58855}Listen, Father, can I show you these|and you couId teII me what you think?
{58888}{58934}Yes. Yes, of course.
{59661}{59704}Coffee, honey?
{59757}{59803}WeII, what do you think?
{59807}{59893}- It doesn't reaIIy matter what I think.|- What does that mean?
{59897}{59962}It means officiaIIy|this is not a case for the Church.
{59966}{60097}To say that a seIf-confessed atheist|exhibits the wounds of Christ
{60101}{60151}- is a contradiction in terms.|- Here.
{60155}{60236}Read that. I found that on my kitchen|tabIe the other morning.
{60240}{60320}Now, I don't know what that says,|but that handwriting is mine.
{60324}{60361}It's ItaIian.
{60365}{60467}It says, ''SpIit a piece of wood|and I'm there.''
{60480}{60544}''Lift a stone and you wiII find me.''
{60548}{60631}- It's quite beautifuI, actuaIIy.|- This isn't beautifuI!
{60635}{60701}This is a warning!|It means no matter what I do,...
{60705}{60755}- Miss Paige...|- ..I can't escape it.
{60759}{60856}- Miss Paige, I wouId reaIIy Iike to heIp...|- You know what?
{60860}{60933}This is not going anywhere.|You don't know what this is.
{60937}{61009}You can't give me an answer.|Coffee's on me. Here.
{61720}{61816}There is no scientific explanation.
{61915}{61983}Stigmatics are deeply religious people.
{62011}{62073}We're gonna do whatever we can
{62077}{62190}to find out, but, all things considered,|l think it might explain a lot.
{62194}{62306}Throughout history,|only people who believe deeply in God
{62310}{62387}have been afflicted with these wounds.|The nearer they come to God,
{62391}{62457}the more open they are|to the torment oftheir demons.
{62492}{62543}The Church regards it as a gift.
{62547}{62591}A gift from God.
{62852}{62934}- Here's to Friday night.|- Yeah. To Friday night, honey.
{63036}{63070}Frankie!
{63116}{63224}Don't worry. Order another drink.|I'II be right back. I'm gonna check it out.
{63228}{63262} But youjust can't tell
{63266}{63326} Don't hold your breath|But the pretty things are going to hell
{63330}{63376}- Hey, girIfriend.|- Hey.
{63380}{63459}- What's up? I thought you were resting.|- Have you seen Steven?
{63463}{63532}Forget about Steven.|What's up with that priest?
{63536}{63583}BeIieve me, he's aII business.
{63587}{63639}Hey, can we get two doubIes each?
{63643}{63716}Hey, you know what's scarier|than not beIieving in God?
{63720}{63752}BeIieving in him.
{63756}{63849}I mean reaIIy beIieving in him|is a fucking terrifying thought.
{63853}{63919}It's Friday night.|You're taking things too seriousIy.
{63923}{63999}If there is a God, he hates me.|He's ruining my Iife.
{64003}{64062}Frankie, it's gonna be aII right. Man, reIax.
{64066}{64149}You don't get it, do you?|I have fucking hoIes through my wrists!
{64153}{64212}I have sIashes across my back!
{64216}{64292}If it isn't God that's doing this to me,|then who is?
{64326}{64376}I think you're Iosing it, man.
{64447}{64495}Where you goin'?
{64527}{64556}Frankie!
{64794}{64814}Frankie!
{64859}{64898}Frankie, get up!
{64902}{64954}Get up! Frankie!
{65184}{65252}Don't just fuckin' stand there!|CaII an ambuIance!
{65256}{65276}Damn.
{65557}{65609}Frankie, where are you?!
{65946}{65985}Get out of there!
{66593}{66644}Miss Paige?
{69530}{69568}Frankie!
{69879}{69974}- Let's get you outta here.|- Frankie.
{69978}{70114}- We need to get her to a safe pIace.|- Here, I got you. I got you.
{70961}{71037}- WeIcome back.|- Where am I?
{71041}{71100}You're in Father Durning's church.
{71158}{71191}Here.
{71195}{71243}I think she shouId get some rest.
{71259}{71312}You aII right?
{71424}{71478}You Iook Iike shit.
{71482}{71530}It smeIIs Iike...
{71568}{71598}fIowers.
{71621}{71685}You've got stuff aII in your hair.
{72238}{72261}Pronto.
{72265}{72329}- Gianni, come stai?|- Andrew, how are you?
{72332}{72361}Gianni, listen...
{72365}{72439}- CouId you transIate something?|- Si. Do you have it there?
{72443}{72497}Yes, I have it here. I'II pIay it.
{72760}{72795}Thama...
{72799}{72905}- WeII, what is it? Is it gibberish?|- No, it's not gibberish at all.
{72909}{72952}Who is speaking?
{74630}{74728}- Morning, Miss Paige. You're up earIy.|- Hey, I think you made a mistake.
{74732}{74791}- What do you mean?|- I can't have stigmata.
{74795}{74884}Jesus was crucified through|the paIms of his hands, not his wrists.
{74888}{74960}My wounds are through the wrists.|So you're wrong.
{74964}{75086}ActuaIIy, scientists have discovered that|in Roman times peopIe were crucified
{75090}{75145}through the wrists, not the paIms.
{75149}{75209}The hands couIdn't support|the body weight,
{75213}{75269}so they did crucify them|through the wrists.
{75273}{75386}No, wait, you're teIIing me|that every painting,
{75390}{75440}every statue ofChrist,
{75444}{75515}every singIe crucifix|in the whoIe worId is wrong?
{75519}{75628}No, no, just inaccurate.|They're impressions of the truth.
{75632}{75719}Icons are meant to be inspirationaI.
{75723}{75800}Miss Paige,|there's something eIse you shouId know.
{75804}{75897}The words you keep repeating|that, uh, you thought were nonsense.
{75901}{75946}It's not.
{75950}{76048}It's actuaIIy a very specific Ianguage.|It's a form of Aramaic.
{76074}{76103}What?
{76107}{76187}It's a form of Aramaic|that hasn't been used for 1900 years.
{76191}{76272}It's a diaIect that was used in GaIiIee|around the time of Jesus.
{77272}{77342}Split a piece of wood and l am there.
{77351}{77419}Lift a stone and you will find me.
{78745}{78803}- Did you get through?|- No.
{78807}{78855}Her machine didn't even pick up.
{79455}{79503}Miss Paige?
{80315}{80354}Frankie?
{81178}{81221}Who are you?
{81327}{81401}The messenger is not important.
{83927}{84005}I feeI Iike my heart is breaking.
{84088}{84143}Why am I so sad?
{84338}{84386}It smeIIs Iike fIowers in here.
{84453}{84522}Like... jasmine or...
{84565}{84618}..rose or something.
{84634}{84698}- Can you smeII that?|- Yes, I can.
{84795}{84846}- Who wrote that?|- You did.
{84850}{84922}- l wrote that?!|- Yes.
{85238}{85305}- Have you heard from Father Andrew?|- No, Eminence.
{85309}{85381}- He hasn't fiIed a report.|- What are these?
{85385}{85466}These are newspaper cIippings|from our office in New York.
{85470}{85524}The first one is from PennsyIvania.
{85528}{85595}The others are from New York|and Washington.
{85599}{85704}These are even more damaging.|This one mentions the stigmata.
{85708}{85805}- He isn't defusing the situation.|- ShaII I caII him home?
{85809}{85932}Have him concIude his investigation|and report to me in New York next week.
{86044}{86132}Frankie, can you pIease come over here|and have a Iook at this?
{86136}{86214}I just can't beIieve that none of this|means anything to you.
{86323}{86346}Frankie?
{86541}{86591}Frankie, can you pIease...
{86673}{86738}Can you pIease Iook at this?
{86744}{86851}Sometimes subjects retain fragments|or images that can be transmitted
{86855}{86882}subconsciousIy.
{86886}{86980}This subject doesn't retain|fragments of images.
{86984}{87096}You don't get it, do you, Father Kiernan?|I don't know what the heII that means!
{87100}{87199}I don't know what the heII this means.|I just want my Iife back, OK?
{87356}{87460} l'm sitting amongst yourselves
{87464}{87564} Don't think you can see me
{87582}{87667} l haven't gone anywhere
{87695}{87782} But out ofmy body
{87814}{87906} Reach out and touch me
{87929}{88024} Make effort to speak to me
{88044}{88137} Call out and you'll hear me
{88159}{88242} Be happy for me...
{88246}{88292}Miss Paige?
{88296}{88388}Miss Paige, I'm sorry.
{88393}{88464}Don't ''Miss Paige'' me|just because you messed up.
{88468}{88523}I'm not gonna Iet you off the hook.
{88527}{88606}OK, but I am sorry.
{88610}{88683}You know, for a priest|you're pretty reIentIess.
{88687}{88796}Yeah, I guess I stopped being a priest|and sIipped back into being a scientist.
{88800}{88847}It happens.
{88851}{88925}Hey, what kind of a scientist|is a priest, anyway?
{88929}{88977}You don't want to know.
{88981}{89036}Oh, yes, I do!
{89041}{89085}You were an organic chemist?
{89089}{89153}Did you waIk around|with those gIasses
{89156}{89246}with Scotch tape around the sides,|and pocket protectors?
{89250}{89303}I did, actuaIIy.
{89307}{89411}Anyway, one day I just decided that|I was going to become a priest.
{89415}{89438}Why?
{89442}{89496}- The hoIes.|- The hoIes?
{89500}{89557}- The hoIes in the theories.|- What theories?
{89561}{89613}The worId is six biIIion years oId.
{89617}{89735}There's been Iife for three biIIion years,|but before that there was nothing.
{89739}{89820}No Iife.|Just a bunch of eIements swirIing around.
{89824}{89899}And then one day,|for no apparent reason whatsoever,
{89903}{89976}aII these eIements|came together in perfect harmony
{89980}{90027}and there was suddenIy Iife.
{90031}{90115}Living things Iike IiIac|and... and hedgehogs and...
{90119}{90167}Beer and... cheesecake.
{90171}{90252}Beer and cheesecake.|Did you know monks invented aIcohoI?
{90256}{90320}- Yeah. Everybody knows that.|- You knew that?
{90323}{90346}Yeah.
{90350}{90442}WeII, anyway, to get back to the big hoIe.|There reaIIy...
{90446}{90502}There reaIIy isn't any expIanation.
{90517}{90589}And, I figured that|there was something more than
{90593}{90668}weII, more important than|organic chemistry going on,
{90672}{90725}and I figured that... it was God.
{90729}{90816}And that God was responsibIe|for aII this... Iife.
{90820}{90902}- I reaIIy can't get a Iine on you.|- Why not?
{90906}{91013}- I can't understand a man who's never...|- Never made Iove to a woman?
{91017}{91106}WeII, this may come|as a great surprise to you, but
{91113}{91164}I wasn't born a priest.
{91198}{91254}- You didn't Iike it?|- What's not to Iike?
{91258}{91334}- But you don't miss it?|- Yes, of course I miss it.
{91338}{91400}I mean, I'm human, you know.
{91404}{91535}I struggIe with it, but I've made a choice.|BasicaIIy, I've exchanged
{91539}{91612}one set of compIications for another.
{93357}{93409}So this is the fourth?
{93413}{93477}- What do you mean?|- When I first met you,
{93480}{93553}didn't you say that|there were five wounds?
{93557}{93638}WeII, this is the fourth. What's the fifth?
{93683}{93731}The spear.
{93743}{93795}That's the wound that kiIIed him.
{93799}{93847}Don't worry, Frankie.
{93851}{93932}No stigmatic has ever received|the fuII five wounds.
{93936}{94017}Have you ever met another person|who had stigmata?
{94021}{94137}I did make a piIgrimage to a smaII viIIage|in the mountains of southern ItaIy.
{94141}{94196}There I met a priest caIIed Padre Pio.
{94200}{94277}He first received the wounds|when he was 23 years of age,
{94281}{94346}the same age as Saint Francis of Assisi.
{94350}{94398}Who's Saint Francis of Assisi?
{94402}{94530}Saint Francis was the first person|to receive the stigmata, in the 1 3thC.
{94533}{94614}He was a wiId young man,|who suddenIy changed his ways
{94618}{94714}after he'd had a vision|of being crucified aIongside Christ.
{94718}{94840}When he woke up, his hands|and his feet were... were bIeeding.
{94844}{94919}This priest,|were his wounds as bad as mine?
{94923}{94961}Padre Pio.
{94965}{95088}Sometimes he Iost a pint of bIood a day.|And he suffered terribIe demonic attacks.
{95092}{95117}A priest?
{95121}{95225}AII stigmatics suffer|the most intense spirituaI confIict.
{95229}{95276}The nearer they come to God,
{95280}{95371}the more open they are to temptation,|to eviI visions,
{95380}{95448}to the torment of their demons.
{95452}{95570}A smeII accompanies the wounds.|The odour of sanctity, the smeII of...
{95574}{95597}FIowers?
{95601}{95639}Yes.
{95658}{95685}FIowers.
{95722}{95770}WeII, what happened to him?
{95774}{95832}How many wounds did he receive?
{95836}{95884}He...
{95896}{95957}He Iived to oId age.
{95961}{96025}How many wounds did he receive?
{96115}{96144}Two.
{96306}{96354}I'm dying, aren't I?
{96424}{96474}This thing is kiIIing me.
{97037}{97083}Here's a cIoser shot.
{97087}{97141}My guess is it's probablyAramaic.
{97145}{97174}Aspetta.
{97178}{97226}I'm Iooking at it.
{97246}{97306}ls there a... ls there a problem, Gianni?
{97310}{97377}Yes. Don't send me any more pictures.
{97381}{97437}- How many did you send?|- Six. Why?
{97441}{97525}- The probIem is what it says.|- WeII, what does it say?
{97529}{97636}It says, ''The kingdom of God is|inside you, and aII about you.''
{97640}{97687}Andrew, forget you saw this.
{97691}{97776}- Drop it immediately.|- Gianni, what is the probIem?
{97780}{97847}Do you remember the GospeIs...
{97883}{97964}Gianni? Gianni, are you still there?
{97968}{98027}Do you remember|the GospeIs Commission?
{98031}{98112}lt was closed down suddenly|by your friend Cardinal Houseman.
{98116}{98161}Yes, a few years ago, yes.
{98165}{98251}We discovered a document that|looked like a completely new gospel.
{98255}{98321}- What's the significance?|- l was one ofthe three
{98325}{98432}transIators of this gospeI.|It was written entireIy in Aramaic.
{98444}{98515}The Ianguage of Jesus and his discipIes.
{98519}{98569}It may be Jesus's actuaI words.
{98573}{98600}He's...
{98626}{98703}Where is it now?
{98723}{98776}Gianni? What's going on?
{98780}{98819}Are you there?
{98823}{98842}Gianni?
{98968}{99016}Buona sera.
{99093}{99131}What's this?
{99254}{99302}Is that a painting?
{99306}{99355}- No, it's a mirror.|- Who eIse was there?
{99359}{99437}- I don't know.|- I thought you said it was just you two.
{99454}{99502}16a. Do you have the neg?
{99568}{99616}Who is that?
{99746}{99804}I'II be back as soon as I can.
{100410}{100472}- CardinaI Houseman.|- I'm Iate for a meeting.
{100476}{100550}- I think this might be of interest.|- What is it?
{100679}{100777}- Where did you get this?|- It was e-maiIed to Father DeImonico.
{100781}{100855}- By who?|- Father Kiernan in Pittsburgh.
{100885}{100935}- Do you know what it means?|- No.
{100939}{100989}Is it important?
{100993}{101084}WiII you teII the meeting|I'II be with them in a few minutes?
{101203}{101242}New York City
{101299}{101334}Who is it?
{101338}{101395}Don't hang up. Don't hang up.
{101399}{101432}Who's this?
{101436}{101472}It's an oId friend.
{101476}{101579}- DeImonico? What's happened?|- The missing Jesus gospeI... It turned up.
{101583}{101616}That's impossibIe.
{101620}{101640}AIameida...
{101644}{101676}AIameida?
{101680}{101730}In the United States. Pittsburgh.
{101734}{101763}Send me something.
{101767}{101815}No. No, I can't.
{101819}{101867}Houseman wiII kiII me.
{102336}{102409}Hi, come in. The door's open.
{102593}{102623}Frankie?
{102627}{102675}I'm in here!
{102814}{102878}How you doin'? Want a beer?
{102893}{102921}Sure.
{103041}{103151}- Check these out. They're getting better.|- That's great.
{103186}{103215}ReaIIy good.
{103219}{103286}You'II be abIe to get|these stitches out soon.
{103290}{103338}That's great.
{103342}{103390}Let me see your forehead.
{103444}{103510}- Does this... Does this hurt?|- No.
{103549}{103590}Great. You'II...
{104197}{104246}Why did you paint over the waII?
{104250}{104321}I got bored, and I got sick|of Iooking at that thing.
{105239}{105327}I reaIIy wish you weren't wearing|that uniform right now.
{105331}{105388}It's got nothing to do with the uniform.
{105392}{105470}WeII, what is it? You took a vow|to be dead from the neck down?
{105521}{105561}Come on!
{105565}{105673}I've seen the way you Iook at me.|You know the way that I feeI about you.
{105685}{105754}Come on, I'm not bIind. It's OK.
{105758}{105784}No.
{105804}{105892}Why, because I...|I painted the waII out? Is that it?
{105896}{105967}So now I'm no use to you, right? Is that it?
{105971}{106030}Answer me!
{106053}{106161}You are so proud of your hoIy abstinence!
{106195}{106255}Like touching a woman wouId kiII you!
{106259}{106335}Women are dirty IittIe compIications!
{106409}{106457}That's why you became a priest.
{106461}{106554}It has nothing to do|with your convenient IittIe stories!
{106683}{106758}Oh, you're so proud of your church,
{106762}{106829}of virgins and eunuchs!
{107554}{107644}How's your faith these days, Father?
{107648}{107706}How's your faith these days?!
{107710}{107779}This is what you fucking caII God?
{107865}{107909}BIood of Christ!
{112610}{112720}- I've never seen you pray before.|- I haven't prayed for a very Iong time.
{112774}{112817}Come here.
{112866}{112924}It's OK. Come on.
{114456}{114504}Go in.
{114844}{114922}- DanieI.|- We've come to heIp.
{114953}{115010}Take her to the archdiocese.
{115486}{115556}I'II be downstairs if you need me, Sister.
{115694}{115766}Where did you get this from, hm?|What does it mean?
{115770}{115839}The girI wrote it.|I don't know what it means.
{115843}{115891}Neither does she.
{115896}{115943}Why was it painted over?
{115947}{116029}- What Ianguage is it in?|- It's Aramaic.
{116033}{116092}How do you know that?
{116096}{116156}- That's irreIevant.|- What I don't understand
{116160}{116240}is why you wouId send this|to anyone other than me.
{116244}{116303}- What are you hiding?|- AII I know is
{116307}{116364}that the girI is fighting for her Iife.
{116368}{116465}If she receives another wound|she's going to die unIess we heIp her.
{116469}{116516}Right. I'm taking over.
{116520}{116577}- Get some rest.|- I'm not Ieaving her aIone.
{116581}{116641}You're Ieaving her|in the care of the sisters.
{116645}{116703}You sent me here.|I didn't want to come.
{116707}{116775}You toId me to deaI with her.|That's what I'm doing!
{116779}{116843}She's in no condition|to take on you orthe Church.
{116846}{116922}This is not about a girI|taking on me or taking on the Church!
{116926}{117016}Why are you more concerned|about photographs than a girI dying?
{117020}{117108}- Andrew, where's your IoyaIty?|- Don't you Iecture me about IoyaIty.
{117112}{117187}The onIy reason|you've been toIerated for so Iong
{117191}{117248}is because you were a good scientist.
{117252}{117323}Because of your objectivity.|WeII, you've Iost that.
{117327}{117439}The Iast thing I expected to see in|that girI's apartment was the two of you
{117443}{117496}- Iying on a bed together.|- Oh, come on!
{117500}{117588}You think you're heIping her,|but you're not. She's getting worse.
{117592}{117716}Andrew, you're in no state to heIp anyone|right now. You're exhausted.
{117720}{117808}Go to Father Durning's. Get some rest.|We'II taIk about it tomorrow.
{117812}{117882}Why are you so concerned|with these photographs?
{117886}{117958}Father DeImonico seemed to think|they were important.
{117962}{118050}- What do they mean?|- We've no idea, but we're working on it.
{118054}{118146}- Is it to do with the GospeI Commission?|- We don't know.
{118150}{118198}Good night, Andrew.
{118934}{118982}Andrew Kiernan?
{119031}{119091}- I'm Kiernan.|- I want to see AIameida.
{119095}{119132}I don't know any AIameida.
{119136}{119222}DeImonico faxed me this copy|of his document.
{119226}{119297}The girI wrote this. I saw her do it.|What is this?
{119301}{119411}It's maybe the most significant|Christian reIic ever found.
{119415}{119445}Why?
{119449}{119526}It's an Aramaic scroII|from the first century,
{119530}{119653}discovered near the caves of the|Dead Sea ScroIIs, outside JerusaIem.
{119657}{119715}AIameida and I concIuded that
{119739}{119828}it is a gospeI... of Jesus Christ,
{119832}{119899}in his own words... Aramaic.
{119903}{120016}But there are some factions in the Vatican|who beIieve that this document
{120020}{120101}couId destroy the authority|of the modern Church.
{120105}{120143}How?
{120177}{120280}It was Jesus' words to his discipIes|on the night of his Last Supper.
{120284}{120426}His instructions to them on how to|continue his church after his death.
{120430}{120491}Why wouId that be so... so threatening?
{120495}{120585}When we gave our initiaI concIusions|to the GospeI Commission,
{120589}{120653}Houseman ordered us|to stop immediateIy.
{120657}{120724}AIameida refused.|He stoIe the document and disappeared.
{120728}{120792}Houseman excommunicated us|in our absence.
{120796}{120845}You have no idea where he is?
{120849}{120958}He doesn't want to be caught|untiI he finishes the transIation.
{120962}{121014}I'II show you this guy.
{121018}{121122}That's DeImonico, me and AIameida.|We were aII transIating the new gospeI.
{121126}{121216}I've seen this man.|Three weeks ago, in BraziI.
{121220}{121267}- Yeah?|- He's dead.
{121271}{121304}How do you know this?
{121308}{121412}Because I saw him in his coffin|in a church in BeIo Quinto. I'm sorry.
{121489}{121569}Then it's aII over. It's gone for ever.
{121574}{121636}Why was your work stopped?
{121640}{121702}What was so threatening|about this gospeI?
{121706}{121793}- Look around you. What do you see?|- I see a church.
{121797}{121834}It's a buiIding.
{121838}{121927}The true church of Jesus Christ|is so much more.
{121931}{121996}Not in buiIdings made of wood and stone.
{122000}{122042}I love Jesus!
{122046}{122120}I don't need an institution|between him and me.
{122124}{122175}You see, just God and man.
{122179}{122230}No priests, no churches.
{122234}{122311}The first words in Jesus' gospeI are,
{122315}{122402}''The kingdom of God is inside you,
{122406}{122470}and aII around you.''
{122474}{122557}''Not in buiIdings of wood and stone.''
{122561}{122635}''SpIit a piece of wood and I am there.''
{122639}{122712}- ''Lift a stone and...|- ..you wiII find me.''
{122716}{122763}Yes, brother.
{122833}{122927}Why is Father AIameida wearing gIoves?
{122931}{122977}AIameida was a tormented man.
{122981}{123045}HoIy man. A very hoIy man.
{123049}{123161}He wore the gIoves|to cover the marks of the stigmata.
{123288}{123335}She has the stigmata.
{123339}{123387}That's why.
{123453}{123501}She's just his messenger.
{123518}{123582}Houseman wiII never Iet|this gospeI get out.
{123640}{123702}AImighty God,|bIess your humbIe servant,
{123706}{123774}guide me with your HoIy Spirit,|and forgive me
{123778}{123863}for I have sinned exceedingIy|in thought, word and deed.
{124356}{124404}My sins deserve your punishments
{124408}{124495}because they have crucified|my Ioving Saviour, Jesus Christ.
{124499}{124546}Amen.
{125278}{125301}Lord,
{125305}{125376}do not remember our sins,|or those of our forefathers.
{125380}{125452}- Where's Andrew?|- And do not punish us for our offences.
{125456}{125520}Lead us not into temptation.
{125524}{125584}Save this woman, your servant.
{125588}{125660}Spirit of Iust,|by the power of Jesus Christ
{125664}{125743}I command you, come out of her body|now and for aIways.
{125747}{125796}In the name of Jesus Christ|I command you
{125800}{125852}come out of her body now|and for aIways.
{125889}{125918}In the name of Jesus Christ...
{125922}{125978}You are bIind men.
{125982}{126020}Your eyes are open.
{126024}{126062}But you see nothing.
{126100}{126169}Why do you persecute me?!
{126173}{126239}Send her heIp|from the hoIy pIace, O Lord!
{126326}{126408}Lord, hear my prayer!|Let the enemy have no victory over her!
{126412}{126450}BehoId
{126456}{126486}your servant,
{126490}{126538}dripping with bIood!
{126655}{126705}Embrace me, my chiId. I am the Church.
{126709}{126786}You are the true enemy|of the Church, Houseman.
{126800}{126823}I am the Church.
{126827}{126875}- Stop!|- Get away from me!
{126917}{126984}Get them out of here!|Get out of here! Get out!
{127004}{127060}- Eminenza!|- Get out!
{127105}{127155}Save this woman from woe. O Lord,
{127159}{127220}save this woman, your servant.
{127344}{127400}Send her heIp|from the hoIy pIace, O Lord.
{127404}{127471}Give her heavenIy protection.
{127561}{127642}Save this woman, O Lord!|Let the enemy have no victory over her!
{127778}{127827}Send her heIp from the hoIy pIace.
{127929}{127956}Frankie!
{127960}{128025}You wiII not destroy my Church.
{128247}{128276}Frankie!
{128305}{128352}You must not interrupt.
{128373}{128438}What are you doing?! Get away from her!
{128442}{128509}- Get away from her!|- No! No!
{128513}{128561}Get away!
{128606}{128661}It's aII right. I know what...
{128665}{128698}Andrew!
{128702}{128755}Get away from her!|You don't know what's going on here!
{128759}{128823}You get off me! You Iied to me!
{128827}{128917}You tried to siIence her.|You Iied to me, you bastard!
{128936}{128998}- Andrew...|- You tried to kiII her!
{129030}{129131}I know everything. I know why you|cIosed down the GospeI Commission,
{129135}{129210}why you had PetroceIIi|and AIameida excommunicated,
