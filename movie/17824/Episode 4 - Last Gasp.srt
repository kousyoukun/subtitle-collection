1
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,245
Graham?

2
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,805
Graham.
What?

3
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,961
How do you turn this on?

4
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,201
It is on.

5
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,290
How do I record?

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,486
Press the button.

7
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,241
This one?

8
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,567
Yeah.

9
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,930
Why's the light on?

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,684
It's in standby.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,046
Oh, right.

12
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,651
Tam-Tam?

13
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,682
Tam-Tam, when I say go,
I want you to explain

14
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,047
what day it is and who's coming,
okay, love?

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,531
Why?

16
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:01,295
Well, so we have a record of it.
You don't want to forget it, do you?

17
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,368
Hang on, let me find the button again.

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,249
Right.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:06,924
And...

20
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,886
Go.

21
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,362
Well done, Tam-Tam.
Do you want to watch it back?

22
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,771
No, thanks.

23
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:19,286
All right. We'll watch it later.

24
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,248
Oh, I can't bloody do it.
Where's the pumper?

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,495
What do you mean you can't do it?

26
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,124
It's these stupid long ones.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,168
Well, stretch it, Graham, stretch it!

28
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,446
Oh, just get me the pumper!

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,524
I told you to do them last night!

30
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,568
He's here! Graham, oh, my God!

31
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,642
All right, calm down,
he's only flesh and blood.

32
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:46,166
I know, but in our house!
Graham, oh, my God!

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,685
His turds are brown, aren't they?

34
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:49,250
Oh, Graham...
Well...

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,845
Oh. He's here, Tammy!

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,281
Hello! Come on, come in.
She's just through here.

37
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,451
You, uh, found us all right, then?
Yeah, no problem.

38
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,526
Oh, this is my wife, Jan.

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,726
Oh!

40
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,962
Hi. Frankie Parsons.

41
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,246
I know.

42
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,802
She's a big fan of yours.
Oh, Graham.

43
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,209
Lovely to meet you.
You've got beautiful eyes.

44
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,845
Oh. Oh!

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,968
Uh, you know Sally from the Make-A...

46
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,371
Wishmaker, UK.

47
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,643
We spoke on the phone. Hi.
Hi.

48
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,324
Oh, gosh, what a lovely house.

49
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,640
Oh, thank you, it's a...

50
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,087
So, is this jasmine through here?

51
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,241
Tamsin.
Tasmin?

52
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,890
Tamsin.
Tamsin.

53
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,927
Hello, Tamsin.

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,570
Happy birthday.

55
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,248
So, you're nine today, are you?

56
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,721
Oh, hang on a second.
I just want a video of this.

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,087
Do you mind?
No, no, not at all.

58
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,128
<i>I'd like a copy for myself, actually.</i>

59
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,331
<i>I'm excited to meet this brave, little
girl who I've heard so much about.</i>

60
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,683
<i>You want me to step out
and come back in again?</i>

61
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,240
Oh, yes, please.

62
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,767
<i>Ready? Hey!</i>

63
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,727
<i>Oh, there's no need for you to do that.
I'll go and get the pumper.</i>

64
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,643
<i>It's okay! I got it.</i>

65
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,524
<i>Too many cigarettes.</i>

66
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,840
<i>Are you okay?</i>

67
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,323
<i>Almost done. One more push.</i>

68
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,240
Oh...

69
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,401
Daddy!

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,681
<i>Shit, what's happened?</i>

71
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,761
<i>Jan!
He fell.</i>

72
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,365
<i>Um, what do you mean he fell?</i>

73
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,441
<i>Mr. Parsons!</i>

74
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,931
<i>He's...
Mr. Parsons!</i>

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,375
<i>Get him a cup of water or something.</i>

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,890
<i>Jan!
What's he done?</i>

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,600
<i>He's not breathing!

78
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,321
Here.

79
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,281
Do you take sugar, Sally?
No.

80
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,601
Yes, actually, do you have sweeteners?

81
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,491
Um, Jan, do we have sweeteners?

82
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,607
In the drawer.

83
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,166
Which?

84
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,530
The one with the Hoover bags.

85
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,281
Sorry, I still don't...

86
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,846
I'll get them.

87
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,205
She's upset.

88
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,729
She wanted him to sign her CDs.

89
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:43,843
Oh, we have autographs on file.
I can arrange to have one sent.

90
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,251
Oh, thanks.

91
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,571
Be worth a few bob now, I should think.
I know.

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,610
Mr. Forbouys is on his way.

93
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,162
He said don't touch anything
until he gets here.

94
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,520
Right.

95
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,928
Mr. Forbouys is Frankie's manager.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,287
Was Frankie's manager.

97
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,966
Here. They're packet ones, I'm afraid.

98
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,095
She nicked them off a train.

99
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,121
Oh, Graham!

100
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,646
Well, it hardly matters now, does it?

101
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,326
We've got a world-famous dead pop star
in our Tamsin's bedroom.

102
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,641
No one's going to mind
about a few stolen Canderels.

103
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,651
Oh, Tam-Tam...

104
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,766
Love...

105
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,681
Are you sure we shouldn't call 999?

106
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,728
Mr. Forbouys said to wait.

107
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,081
Said this place would be crawling
with pigs if we do that.

108
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,401
You mean police?

109
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,562
No. I'm talking about press, ain't I?

110
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,443
If they find out Mr. Parsons died
in that way, they'll be like vultures.

111
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,522
Must be awful doing that job.

112
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,729
You know, you're either
a pig or a vulture, aren't you?

113
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,407
You're never a horse
or a creature with dignity.

114
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,807
Horrible.

115
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,415
I suppose they'll all want
to get the first picture.

116
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,807
Mmm. Look what they did to Diana.

117
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,048
And Kate.
Yes.

118
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,408
Her boobs are out there now.
She can't take 'em back.

119
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,929
We've got to protect Frankie's legacy.

120
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,331
Absolutely.

121
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,726
Are you all right there, Tam-Tam?

122
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:11,045
Do you want me to take that off you,
love?

123
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,730
Can I take the balloon, please, miss?

124
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,404
Aw, let her keep it.

125
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,881
The balloon?
What do you want it for?

126
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,411
Well...

127
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,488
I believe that you are in infringement

128
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,881
of Mr. Parsons'
intellectual property rights.

129
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,049
What?
It's a comfort to her.

130
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,043
It's only a balloon, for goodness' sake.

131
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,407
One that contains Mr. Parsons' breath.

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,009
His actual dying breath.

133
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,003
Oh, good lord.
Oh, that's made me go all funny.

134
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,243
Oh, just give it to him, Tamsin.

135
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,087
There you go.

136
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,241
Careful!

137
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,130
All right. It's fine.

138
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,486
Tie a knot in it.

139
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,569
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

140
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,881
I just can't do the...

141
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,485
Use two fingers...

142
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,080
I can't do it, can I? It won't...

143
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,647
No... Let me do it.

144
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,564
Just be careful, all right?

145
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,721
Got it?

146
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,175
If you'd only used the pumper,
none of this would have happened.

147
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,406
Jan. please!

148
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,687
There.

149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,206
Thank you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

150
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,363
Let's just take a breath, shall we?

151
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,171
Jan, go and get Tamsin's laptop
from her room, please.

152
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,603
But Frankie's in there.

153
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,808
Just get it, please.

154
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,529
We need to find out
what we're dealing with here.

155
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,810
My boss. Should I answer it?

156
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,041
Yes.
No.

157
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,564
Hi, Nigel.

158
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,611
Oh, gosh. Yes, oh, I'm so sorry,
I completely forgot.

159
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,684
I've got a little boy
with cerebral palsy

160
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,569
who wants to play chess
with Noel Edmonds.

161
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,927
Nigel, could you get Sandy
to cover for me at all?

162
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,925
I'm just dealing with a situation here.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,482
No, no, no, no, it's all going well,
you don't have to come.

164
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,686
It's just, um...

165
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,971
Mr. Parsons wants to stay and...

166
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,321
Suck off...

167
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,681
Sing off with Tamsin on the karaoke.
Yes.

168
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:51,969
Oh, they're having a ball,
they're doing La Bamba as I speak.

169
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,050
<i>♪ La, la, la, la, la Bamba</i>

170
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,121
<i>♪ La, la, la, la Bamba ♪</i>

171
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,962
She's a lucky girl, isn't she?

172
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,282
What is going on?

173
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,887
Frankie's lying dead next door,
and you're singing Billy Joel!

174
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,327
Bill Joel? That wasn't Billy Joel!

175
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,481
Who's Billy Joel'?

176
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,040
Are you serious? Who's Billy Joel?
I've heard it all, now.

177
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:24,330
Well, whoever it is,
I don't think it's appropriate.

178
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,162
Disaster averted. We don't really want
anybody else coming round, do we?

179
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,083
Not until Mr. Forbouys gets here.

180
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,484
I'm going to give this to you
as a neutral, okay?

181
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,930
Yes. Fine. Oh, let me just
take my ring off, it's a bit spiky.

182
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,961
There.

183
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,123
That's better, isn't it?

184
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,451
Is this some sort of party game?

185
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,095
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Step away
from the balloon, miss, all right?

186
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,168
What's going on?
Miss, I need you to step away.

187
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,415
Oh, you've all lost your heads.

188
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,761
All right, here we go. Look at this.

189
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,608
Justin Bieber's fringe, $40,000.
Gosh.

190
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,001
Elvis Presley's hair, $120,000.

191
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,484
Michael Jackson's glove, $400,000.

192
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,160
What's this got to do with anything?

193
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,846
Jan, we've got a balloon here containing
Frankie Parsons' final breath.

194
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,685
His actual dying breath,
captured and preserved for eternity.

195
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,001
We've even got the video to prove it.

196
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,965
Oh, that's sick.

197
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,931
The world's sick, Jan.

198
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,925
Someone paid five and a half grand
for Scarlett Johansson's used tissue.

199
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,684
It's like Billy said.

200
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,250
We didn't start the fire.

201
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,330
You're going to sell
Frankie's last breath?

202
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,768
Well, we don't know what it's worth,
do we? Could be 50 quid or 50,000.

203
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:41,324
Or more. At Wishmaker UK, we get to see
the value people attach to celebrities,

204
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,528
and it's quite staggering, I tell you.

205
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,446
Something like this could make
a lot of children's wishes come true.

206
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:49,761
Yeah, but this is Tamsin's wish.

207
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,051
Isn't it, Ta m-Ta m?

208
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,970
That wish belongs to us.

209
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,124
<i>What about Bermuda Love Triangle?</i>

210
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,324
It's a bit, uh, rocky,
given the circumstances.

211
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,883
Yeah. I suppose we want
something more somber, don't we?

212
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,802
But not maudlin. He was never maudlin.

213
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,729
<i>How about Feel You Up, Feel You Down?</i>

214
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,655
Was that the one where he tried to rap?

215
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,841
Yeah.

216
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,735
Oh, no, I don't like it, Sally,
he uses language.

217
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:47,288
Oh, yes, shit, I'd forgotten, sorry. Oh.
Sorry.

218
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,327
Frankie was best
when he was just classic.

219
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,447
Do you know what I mean?

220
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,646
Mmm.

221
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,446
Timeless.

222
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:01,450
<i>My favorite was One Day In Your Life.</i>

223
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,966
Oh, yes.
That's the one.

224
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,485
<i>One Day In Your Life.</i>

225
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,643
Were you actually a fan of his
before you started to work for him?

226
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,769
No. No, I prefer hip hop.
Gangster rap, that sort of thing.

227
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,404
Oh. I once met Jazzy Jay in a lift.

228
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:18,761
Right.

229
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:03,935
Right, I've got some numbers for you.

230
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,975
I spoke to a woman at Christie's and got
a ballpark figure for the last breaths

231
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,764
of Nelson Mandela and Robbie Williams.

232
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,729
I figured that Frankie
was somewhere in between.

233
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,689
These are hypothetical last breaths?

234
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,411
Yeah, yeah, hypothetical ones,
obviously.

235
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:18,245
Aw, do you need a wee-wee, Tam-Tam?
Go with her, Jan.

236
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,401
I don't need a wee.

237
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,407
Come on, sweetheart.
Your dad wants to talk some business.

238
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,644
So I said, imagine you're at Nelson
Mandela's death bed with a jam jar...

239
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,721
<i>A hm Sat'?</i>

240
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,643
Yeah, well, I was improvising, wasn't I?

241
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,530
Well, that's one birthday
we won't forget in a hurry, isn't it?

242
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,687
How many birthdays do I have left?

243
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,761
We don't know, darling.

244
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,604
Lots and lots, we hope.

245
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,650
I liked Frankie. He was nice.

246
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:54,209
Parsons at our house.

247
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,764
That was going to be my moment.

248
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,050
And now it's gone.

249
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,802
Is it my fault?

250
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,360
Darling, no, why would it be your fault?

251
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,927
I wanted him to blow up the balloon.

252
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,287
Well, you weren't to know.

253
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,690
Will his soul go to heaven?

254
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,126
Yes.

255
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,688
Yes. It will.

256
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,411
So, how are we going to do this?

257
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,201
Well, as a neutral, I'd say
the only fair way is equal shares.

258
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,361
Yeah, absolutely.

259
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,175
Third for you, third for me,
third for the family.

260
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,486
That sounds about right.

261
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,655
Hang on a minute, what do you mean,
"A third for the family?"

262
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,330
Oh, that's a lot of money.

263
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,845
Yeah, but there's three of us.

264
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,767
So, what are you saying?

265
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,209
We should split it in fifths.
Me, Jan, Tamsin, you and Sally.

266
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,282
A fifth.
I worked for him all those years

267
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,815
on shitty wages,
and all I get is a fifth?

268
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,760
Well, that's equal shares, isn't it?
Five people.

269
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,202
How about we compromise
and say quarters?

270
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,645
Quarters?
Yeah.

271
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,767
Twenty five percent each.

272
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,080
So who loses out?

273
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:03,051
Nobody. You and your wife get half,
and we split the other half between us.

274
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,326
Yeah, and what about Tamsin?

275
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,004
She's underage.
So?

276
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,735
She's just a kid,
she shouldn't get that much money.

277
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,807
She's earned it.

278
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,095
What? By making him blow into a balloon
and giving him an aneurysm?

279
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,690
Mr. Vickers.

280
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:18,087
With respect, if we give Tamsin
an equal fifth, well...

281
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,481
That's gonna revert back to you
pretty quickly, isn't it?

282
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,641
What?

283
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,725
I mean, without being emotional,
when the inevitable happens,

284
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,564
you and your wife
are going to be sitting on

285
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,087
three fifths
between the two of you, and, uh...

286
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,766
Simon and I don't think
that's particularly fair, do we?

287
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:34,921
Uh-uh.

288
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,815
Now, just a minute...
Put it down, put it down!

289
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,763
This balloon actually belongs to us.

290
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,815
We paid for it,
Jan will have the receipt somewhere,

291
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,410
so you two can just fuck off!

292
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,961
I beg your pardon?

293
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,610
You heard me! Fuck off!

294
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,967
This is my house, my party
and my balloon!

295
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,724
You invited us here, Mr. Vickers.

296
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,121
Mr. Parsons gave up time
from his busy schedule.

297
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,410
I don't give a shit. He's dead now,
and I want him and you out of my house!

298
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,775
And we'll go just as soon
as you give us what's rightfully ours!

299
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,804
What's rightfully ours, you mean.
Pack of 12, £1.99!

300
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,480
But what's inside it isn't yours, is it?

301
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,923
You own the skin,
but you don't own the air.

302
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,368
Oh, that's right. Nobody owns the air.

303
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,606
All right.

304
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,807
All right, well, if you want the air,
you can have it!

305
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

306
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,606
Is this what you want?

307
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,284
Is it?
Stop it!

308
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:33,650
Get down off the sofa, Graham.

309
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,005
Give the balloon to Tamsin.

310
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,170
It's her birthday. It belongs to her.

311
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,928
She's neutral.
I thought I was neutral.

312
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,490
Not anymore, you're not.

313
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,007
You went from Switzerland to Nazi
Germany in one fell goose step.

314
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,641
Here.

315
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,204
Be very, very careful with it, Tam-Tam.

316
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,888
You know you wanted to go to Disney?
The proper one, not the froggy one?

317
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:15,162
Well, imagine this is your ticket in.
Yeah? Your golden ticket.

318
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:20,610
Don't make promises you can't keep,
Graham. She's been through enough.

319
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,526
Trust me.

320
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,562
Now let's sit down,
have a spot of lunch,

321
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,246
and we'll talk about this like adults.

322
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,882
Must be very rewarding, your job.

323
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,167
Yes, yes, I suppose it is.

324
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,969
When you see
a little boy's face light up

325
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,240
because John Terry's brought him
a signed England shirt,

326
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,329
well, you can't put a price on that.

327
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,891
But you can put a price
on a pop star's last-ever breath?

328
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,008
It's just a guesstimate.

329
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,481
Something to put in the budget,
you know.

330
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,922
Well, what's the best dream
you've ever made come true?

331
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,287
Mmm, I'm often asked that.

332
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,406
I'd have to say, and it sounds silly,
really, but there was a little girl

333
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,042
with, I think, Hodgkin's disease.

334
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:22,407
I don't get involved
with the illness side.

335
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,960
And her dream was to be a postman.

336
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,726
That's all.
Not give a letter to the Queen,

337
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,326
or meet Postman Pat, just be a postman.

338
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,240
Nigel shunted it my way.

339
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,005
Zero press interest, there,
of course, but...

340
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,926
When we gave her that letter and told
her to put it through the letter box,

341
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,606
the little giggle after it landed,
as if it meant the whole world to her.

342
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,446
Then she dropped down dead,
right there on the doorstep.

343
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:55,366
Press went mad for it.
So, up yours, Nigel.

344
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,643
That was my favorite one.

345
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,929
Mr. Forbouys said he'll be here
in 20 minutes

346
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,215
with the coroner and ambulance crew.

347
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,287
Okay.

348
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:12,681
They'll be incognito
so they don't raise any alarm.

349
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,046
Hmm.

350
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,044
Said he wanted to do this with dignity.
Absolutely.

351
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,680
You didn't tell him about...
Oh, no, no, no.

352
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,801
I'll just claim ignorance.

353
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,609
Yeah, probably best.

354
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,165
Was he a good boss?

355
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,685
Who, Mr. Parsons?

356
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,642
Bit of a dick, to be honest.
Yeah.

357
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,802
I mean, he knew how to work it
and all that,

358
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,370
but I don't think he was a happy man.

359
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,415
You should have heard the way he was
bitching about having to come here.

360
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,487
No.
Aye.

361
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,803
"I shouldn't have to be around these
sick kids. They make me depressed."

362
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,882
Oh, how disappointing.

363
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,247
Don't say anything to Jan, will you?
She'll be mortified.

364
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,084
Oh, no, no, no, of course not.

365
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,164
But, you see, that's the trouble
with being famous, isn't it?

366
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,969
Your life's not your own anymore.

367
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,849
Hmm. No, for real.

368
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,244
What the...

369
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,044
Oh.
Oh, thank God.

370
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,121
Oh, my God.

371
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,655
It was just a car backfiring.

372
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,175
I'm not being funny,
but I think we should put

373
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,089
the item upstairs
out of the way somewhere.

374
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,095
This place is gonna be crawling
with quacks in a few minutes.

375
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,849
Anything can happen.
Yeah.

376
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,287
And are the quacks
linked to the pigs or...

377
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,560
I'll put it in the spare room.

378
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,400
Well, as long as it's safe, yeah?
It will be.

379
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,562
Come on, Tam-Tam, give it to Daddy.

380
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,081
Good girl.

381
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,131
Let go, sweetheart.

382
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,849
Daddy needs this, come on.

383
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,366
Good girl.

384
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,200
Let go.

385
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,891
I'm coming with you.

386
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,641
Let's put some music on, Tam.
Cheer you up a bit.

387
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,004
Be about seven or eight minutes.

388
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,001
Cool.

389
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,205
Thanks, man.

390
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,083
You all right, Tam-Tam?

391
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,204
Do her another balloon, Graham,
she misses it.

392
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,930
How can she miss it? It's only a...

393
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,046
What color do you want, darling?
There's white, yellow, purple...

394
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,322
How many more purple ones?
Two.

395
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,691
You know, if we could sell the first one
to a private bidder,

396
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,491
no public auction,
confidentiality clause...

397
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,721
We've got the video evidence.

398
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,484
Just add a bit of Frankie's DNA.

399
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,126
Do it.

400
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,881
Isn't that cheating?

401
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,646
Doesn't matter. A thing is only worth
what someone is willing to pay for it.

402
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,255
Careful, Graham,
you'll do yourself an injury.

403
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,815
Well, go and get the bloody pumper,
then!

404
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,205
I don't know where it is!

405
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,006
Oh...
Just give me that.

406
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,161
Oh...

407
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,364
Oh, God, I'm feeling all light-headed...

408
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,521
Stretch it first.

409
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,170
I'm seeing stars.

410
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:52,730
Oh...
I found the pumper. It was in the...

411
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,891
Is Frankie better now?

412
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,369
Jan, take Tamsin to the toilet, please.

413
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,283
I don't want to go.
Just do it.

414
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,044
Come on, sweetheart.
No!

415
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,765
Mummy will change your bag for you.

416
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,127
No! I don't want to!

417
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,681
Is he...

418
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,286
He's alive.

419
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,521
Good.

420
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,931
Well, that's fantastic, isn't it?
Yes.

421
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,923
It's a very faint pulse.

422
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:50,047
Well, we just have to cross our fingers
and hope for the best.

423
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,246
Right.

424
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,325
What is the best?

425
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,895
How long till the ambulance crew
get here?

426
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,524
Five minutes.
Okay.

427
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,681
Okay. I mean, it's still going
to be worth something.

428
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,525
Someone bought Justin Timberlake's
toast crumbs for like, three grand,

429
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,921
I mean, it's not like it's been
a total waste of time.

430
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,843
Pick a hand.
What?

431
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,255
Pick a hand,
we've got to do this quickly!

432
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:12,408
Do what? What are we talking about here?

433
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,970
Just pick one for fuck's sake.

434
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,889
Huh. It's your job, man.

435
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,531
What, my job?
No, I found the coin, I won!

436
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,284
Coin loses.
Says who?

437
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,850
Just flip it. Heads or tails.

438
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,895
Hang on a minute.
How come this is just a two-man thing?

439
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,975
Do you want the money or not?

440
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,055
Yes!
Well then, call it, then!

441
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,175
She knocked herself out blowing up
a balloon, never mind that!

442
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,486
To be fair, so did he!

443
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:31,686
Call it. Call it!

444
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,842
No, I'm not prepared
to play God in this way!

445
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,764
That man's a huge star, he brings
pleasure to millions of people!

446
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,683
Not like that, he doesn't.
How do you know?

447
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,922
He had a brain aneurysm.
He's a vegetable.

448
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,495
He'll spend the rest of his life
bed-bound,

449
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:44,015
eating through a straw
and shitting into a bucket.

450
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,495
What kind of life is that? No offense.

451
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,601
No offense?

452
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,251
That one of the most offensive things
I've ever heard in my life!

453
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:53,929
Look, I spend my whole life making
other people's dreams come true,

454
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,255
standing by and smiling
while they fly off in a helicopter

455
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,489
with a candy floss in one hand
and a D-lister in the other.

456
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:03,406
Why can't it be my turn?
What about my needs, my wishes?

457
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,289
The man's alive.

458
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,089
Not for much longer.

459
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,647
Now call it.

460
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,481
No. I can't.

461
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,607
Call it.

462
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,727
Heads!

463
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,806
Heads.

464
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,169
You win. Fuck!

465
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,690
Get me a cushion.

466
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,806
Oh, I can't be here for this.

467
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,370
I can't witness this!

468
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,566
Oh, God.

469
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,121
Here.

470
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,128
Get his DNA on these.

471
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,124
We might be able to do something
with them at a later date.

472
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,201
Right.

473
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,842
I'll go and have a little chat
with Tam-Tam.

474
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,570
Tell her the bad news.

475
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,085
Right. I'm going with Mr. Forbouys.

476
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,889
Pigs'll be onto this within the hour.

477
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,727
So be ready, yeah?
Sit tight, and I'll be in touch.

478
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,164
Nice to meet you.

479
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,411
Well, the press are going to have
a field day with this.

480
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,131
We should have another look
at that camcorder footage, actually.

481
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,202
If we cut it into 30-second segments,

482
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,520
we might be able to sell a chunk
to each of the networks.

483
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:59,201
I wouldn't bet on it. Our Jan did
most of the filming, remember?

484
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,961
Oh, God, Tamsin!

485
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,809
Tam-Tam?

486
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,881
Tamsin!

487
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:11,966
Tamsin!

488
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,640
Tamsin, where are you, darling?

489
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,725
Tam-Tam?

490
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:26,126
Graham, where's Tamsin?
I can't find her.

491
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,281
Eh?

492
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,491
She's there, look.

493
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,601
Tamsin!

494
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,291
Tamsin? What are you doing?

495
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,521
Tamsin, no!

496
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,089
Shit!
Film it, film it, it's all we've got!
