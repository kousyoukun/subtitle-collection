00:00:01,595 --> 00:00:04,428
(Multicom Jingle)

2
00:00:14,550 --> 00:00:17,000
(wind howling)

3
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,583
(ominous orchestral music)

4
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,150
(gasping)
(thunder crashing)

5
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,757
(chanting in foreign language)

6
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:15,091
(thunder crashing)

7
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,126
(screaming)

8
00:01:36,194 --> 00:01:38,444
(groaning)

9
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,267
(thunder crashing)

10
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,907
(thunder crashing)

11
00:02:37,069 --> 00:02:40,736
(speaking foreign language)

12
00:02:44,729 --> 00:02:47,229
(car honking)

13
00:02:55,923 --> 00:02:58,673
(men chattering)

14
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,263
(sighing)

15
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:14,430
- Where?

16
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,263
- Down.

17
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,213
Found him this morning.

18
00:03:23,365 --> 00:03:27,282
(suspenseful orchestral music)

19
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,987
The second time, Senor Chase.

20
00:03:31,987 --> 00:03:33,480
First Coyar, now Simbron.

21
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,780
Not good for us, not good.

22
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,740
- Same tribe?

23
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,573
- Yes.

24
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:55,980
See the cut.

25
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,603
Here, and here.

26
00:04:00,144 --> 00:04:01,740
Totec.

27
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,013
They don't let you run.

28
00:04:05,077 --> 00:04:06,577
- Did Simbron have any family?

29
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,930
- I don't know.

30
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:10,130
- [Man] No, senor.

31
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,900
- All right, I'll see to it
that he gets a proper burial.

32
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,630
Now you men get back to work.

33
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,868
- Back to work!

34
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,058
Back to work, muchachos.

35
00:04:16,058 --> 00:04:19,725
(speaking foreign language)

36
00:04:35,146 --> 00:04:37,396
(grunting)

37
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:45,636
(speaking foreign language)

38
00:04:45,636 --> 00:04:47,886
(grunting)

39
00:04:52,742 --> 00:04:54,266
(grunting)

40
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:57,099
(water splashing)

41
00:05:09,041 --> 00:05:12,708
(speaking foreign language)

42
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,800
- Hold on a second.

43
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,073
Just let me get a score.

44
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:21,933
Gracias, amigo.

45
00:05:21,933 --> 00:05:23,480
- I was assured that the construction site

46
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,430
was in a controlled area.

47
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,393
- It is.

48
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,613
- It's inhabited by Totec.

49
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,223
- Never asked who it was
controlled by, did you?

50
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,723
Senor Chase,

51
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:39,740
Totec never seen no tourist
hotel going up before.

52
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:42,110
Bound to be a little curious.

53
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,320
- Now their curiosity

54
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,928
has killed two of my workers.

55
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:45,761
- Two?

56
00:05:45,761 --> 00:05:47,140
(laughing)

57
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,363
Two ain't bad.

58
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,083
- I want them removed.

59
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,373
Now.

60
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,003
And I want you to do it.

61
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,447
- Senor Chase,

62
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,350
the Totec has citizens.

63
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,133
Santa Del Sol, Mexico.

64
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,770
Even if they ain't aware of it.

65
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,920
- Who's gonna complain?

66
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,900
- Imagine they might.

67
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,510
- Their presence jeopardizes
the construction of a project

68
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,000
in which I have a substantial
dollar investment.

69
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,110
A project that could transform this

70
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:22,235
primitive pimple of a state
into the next Puerto Vallarta.

71
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:24,640
- Ah, I hate Vallarta.

72
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,323
Too many Americans.

73
00:06:26,323 --> 00:06:28,573
(laughing)

74
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,863
- Thanks.

75
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,413
- Anytime, my friend.

76
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,200
- I suppose you have
tall boots, calf high.

77
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,960
- Several pair.

78
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,040
- Bring those tomorrow night.

79
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,690
They had some pilfering of supplies.

80
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:53,990
You'll be in charge of security.

81
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,160
- Says fucking who?

82
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,590
- The Ministry of Land
Resources after I call tomorrow

83
00:06:58,590 --> 00:07:00,090
and recommend you for the job.

84
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,783
Tall boots.

85
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,193
Protect those tendons.

86
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,570
Goodnight my friend.

87
00:07:12,394 --> 00:07:14,253
- Senor Chase.

88
00:07:16,408 --> 00:07:17,241
- Hm?

89
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,973
- Got me thinking.

90
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,061
- Did I?

91
00:07:23,061 --> 00:07:26,894
(mysterious orchestral music)

92
00:07:40,303 --> 00:07:42,890
(gun firing)

93
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:45,140
(grunting)

94
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:01,464
(gun firing)

95
00:08:09,218 --> 00:08:11,385
(yelling)

96
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:49,323
Totec.

97
00:08:49,323 --> 00:08:50,156
- Yeah.

98
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:56,053
Care for a pop?

99
00:08:57,790 --> 00:08:59,890
- What am I paying you guys for?

100
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,720
- Can't get too near a dying Totec.

101
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,220
Something to do with their spirits.

102
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,590
- Their spirits?

103
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:07,850
- Yeah immortality, reincarnation.

104
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,200
Totec are supposed to live forever.

105
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,420
They believe a man's soul
escapes to another body

106
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,420
in his dying breath.

107
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,820
(laughing)

108
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,940
What's the matter, Senor Chase?

109
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:21,940
Never killed no one?

110
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:41,960
(intense orchestral music)

111
00:09:47,176 --> 00:09:49,676
(gun firing)

112
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,913
Quite the marksman.

113
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,110
(laughing)

114
00:10:11,070 --> 00:10:14,283
The men certainly earned
their pay today, Senor Chase.

115
00:10:16,103 --> 00:10:17,617
- Are you sure that's the lot of them?

116
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,060
- The Totec are no more.

117
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,313
May God forgive us.

118
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:26,540
- I don't need forgiveness.

119
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,330
I can live with myself.

120
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,913
- Oh I hope someday I can.

121
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:42,038
(mysterious orchestral music)

122
00:10:44,008 --> 00:10:46,258
(grunting)

123
00:10:51,394 --> 00:10:53,644
(grunting)

124
00:10:56,827 --> 00:10:58,544
(gagging)

125
00:10:58,544 --> 00:11:02,127
(intense orchestral music)

126
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,152
(grunting)

127
00:11:06,152 --> 00:11:08,569
(gun firing)

128
00:11:15,784 --> 00:11:18,117
(screaming)

129
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,878
(groaning)

130
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,692
(screaming)

131
00:11:52,738 --> 00:11:54,988
(grunting)

132
00:11:58,156 --> 00:12:00,323
(gasping)

133
00:12:02,442 --> 00:12:05,442
(breathing heavily)

134
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,630
- [Cop] I wouldn't count on
seeing Lieutenant today, Ray.

135
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,031
- Ah, I can take a hint.

136
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,283
You mind if I get a cup
of coffee before I go?

137
00:12:31,548 --> 00:12:33,553
- Just be outta here
when I get back, okay?

138
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,640
- Your husband left on his own.

139
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,810
He'll come back if and
when he wants to come back.

140
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:40,240
I understand your concern, but it's like

141
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,640
I told you on the phone.

142
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,640
- Yeah, I know.

143
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,890
It's out of your jurisdiction,

144
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,850
there's no evidence that
the crime took place.

145
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,380
- That's right, Mrs. Weeks.

146
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,283
Now, if you'll excuse me.

147
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,400
- Thanks for all your help, Lieutenant.

148
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,607
- Excuse me, Mrs. Weeks!

149
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,500
Hi.

150
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,571
Ray Tattinger, from Bureau Investigations.

151
00:13:02,571 --> 00:13:05,210
I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation inside.

152
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:07,093
If you're looking to find
somebody, I'm your man.

153
00:13:07,093 --> 00:13:10,330
You've got a heck of a
place here, Mrs. Weeks.

154
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:12,020
- I wish Julian felt the same.

155
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,140
He lost his job, I was
paying all the bills,

156
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,770
I guess he resented it.

157
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:19,530
He messed his head up so
he left to sort things out.

158
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,330
- So, when'd he leave?

159
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,703
- About five months ago.

160
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,110
Last time he called he
was doing construction

161
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,687
working his way south.

162
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:29,460
- When did he say he was coming home?

163
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,980
- Last week of August.

164
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,813
Promised.

165
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,890
He was anxious to get back.

166
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,877
- Four weeks ago--

167
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:37,054
Mmmm.

168
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:40,660
- What are your fees?

169
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,220
- 100 a day per diem, plus travel

170
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,790
which is about two
thirds of the going rate

171
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:47,350
for a licensed investigator and, you know,

172
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,240
cafe's not doing so good?

173
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,793
- [Nora] It's been better.

174
00:13:51,793 --> 00:13:53,970
- It just so happens I'm heading up north

175
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,760
in another case, no need to charge twice

176
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,213
for travel expenses,
only one Ray Tattinger.

177
00:13:58,213 --> 00:14:00,376
(chuckling)

178
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:02,854
- I only got a couple of
hundred dollars in cash.

179
00:14:02,854 --> 00:14:05,132
Can I send you a check for the balance?

180
00:14:05,132 --> 00:14:06,700
- Sure.

181
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,533
You know, Nora,

182
00:14:09,298 --> 00:14:10,290
Mrs. Weeks.

183
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:12,640
You know, some folks do
drop out intentionally.

184
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:18,673
They abandon cars,
homes, businesses, wives.

185
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:23,343
Especially wives, when there's
a third party involved.

186
00:14:24,187 --> 00:14:26,303
- Now you're sounding
like Lieutenant Fladboe.

187
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,220
- Could he be right?

188
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,583
- No, he could not.

189
00:14:33,424 --> 00:14:36,257
(hard rock music)

190
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:51,587
- Have you seen this fella?

191
00:14:57,045 --> 00:14:59,628
Haven't seen this gut, have ya?

192
00:15:06,766 --> 00:15:08,849
Has this guy been around?

193
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:14,160
Damn.

194
00:15:39,248 --> 00:15:42,110
(coughing)

195
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,310
Man, is it hot.

196
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,033
Good thing you got air conditioning.

197
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,320
- [Leslie] Yours?

198
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,153
- No.

199
00:15:49,153 --> 00:15:50,890
It's a loaner.

200
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,073
Jag is in the shop.

201
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,810
- It's parked in my space.

202
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:56,330
- Huh?

203
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,933
- It's parked in my space.

204
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:05,843
- Color me gone.

205
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:11,559
(engine revving)

206
00:16:15,637 --> 00:16:17,680
- [Woman] All yours, 4:45 this afternoon.

207
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,513
- Okay.

208
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:19,346
- [Woman] Thank you.

209
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:21,755
- [Leslie] Who was he?

210
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:22,957
- Mr. Tattinger?

211
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,730
- The man in the Chevrolet.

212
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,530
- [Woman] He was just a claims adjuster.

213
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,380
- [Leslie] For whom?

214
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:29,883
- Imperial Mutual Insurance.

215
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:36,893
- First, we have no affiliation
with a company of this name.

216
00:16:36,893 --> 00:16:38,160
- Well that explains it.

217
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,080
He was looking for someone

218
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,270
we didn't even have on file.

219
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:45,270
- And second, insurance is
spelled A-N-C-E, not E-N-C-E.

220
00:16:47,157 --> 00:16:49,470
Now who again was he looking for?

221
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:52,610
- Mr. Weeks, W-E-E-K-S.

222
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,930
Julian R.

223
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,847
(metal screeching)

224
00:17:01,412 --> 00:17:02,412
- Thank you.

225
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:09,086
(ominous orchestral music)

226
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,124
(whooshing)

227
00:18:56,131 --> 00:18:57,114
- [Julian] Babe.

228
00:18:57,114 --> 00:18:59,391
(Nora laughing)

229
00:18:59,391 --> 00:19:01,125
Come on Nora, smile.

230
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:02,301

231
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:06,481

(clearing throat)

262
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,980
- Ray Tattinger, how can I help?

263
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,180
- [Nora] Good afternoon.

264
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,813
- Oh, is it?

265
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,963
- I didn't hear from you,

266
00:22:10,963 --> 00:22:13,790
I was anxious to find out
what luck you had up north?

267
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,590
- I still got some feelers out, so--

268
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:18,278
- Something's come up, can I see you?

269
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
- Mm, this smells great.

270
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,173
I didn't mean to put you out.

271
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:36,929
- Honestly, you didn't.

272
00:22:42,793 --> 00:22:44,860
There were no records?

273
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:48,050
- Well, the guys at the LCC
site said he worked there.

274
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:50,130
The gal in the office said he didn't,

275
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,530
at least she couldn't
find any paperwork on him.

276
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,992
You said something came up,

277
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:55,903
you wanna talk about it?

278
00:23:03,167 --> 00:23:07,197
"Notice of impound,
Cooks Towing, 82 Mazda."

279
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,983
Julian's.

280
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,200
Well, looks like I head back up there

281
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,550
first thing in the morning.

282
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,702
What if he doesn't come back, Nora?

283
00:23:23,702 --> 00:23:24,535
What then?

284
00:23:26,636 --> 00:23:29,136
- I think we'll have to
assume he'll be back, Ray.

285
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:46,405
(mysterious orchestral music)

286
00:24:14,871 --> 00:24:17,538
(door rattling)

287
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,443
- Help you?

288
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:23,783
- If you're Cooks.

289
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,460
- [Duane] Well, Cooks died.

290
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,460
- That's too bad, so who sends this out?

291
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,280
- Well, I guess I did.

292
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,480
- Well, you aren't sure?

293
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,393
- [Duane] Who are you?

294
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,810
- Ray Tattinger, First Imperial Bank.

295
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,190
We're executives of an estate

296
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,090
that names Mr. Weeks as a beneficiary.

297
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,420
We got a nice little stash for him

298
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,463
if we could only find him.

299
00:24:47,463 --> 00:24:48,420
Mind if I have a look inside?

300
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:49,290
There might be something in there

301
00:24:49,290 --> 00:24:50,540
to help me find this fella.

302
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,730
- You see this here car
was locked when I found it,

303
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,890
and it's supposed to stay that way.

304
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,130
- Yeah, but I have the impound notice.

305
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:57,500
- Yeah, but you see,

306
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,960
you ain't the registered owner,

307
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,553
you see, you ain't Julian R. Weeks.

308
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,693
- I bet Mr. Weeks would appreciate it.

309
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,750
- Now, you see,

310
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,010
now,

311
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:20,010
I better not, because they
come down pretty damn hard

312
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,843
in thus business,

313
00:25:20,843 --> 00:25:22,711
they think we're all crooks as it is.

314
00:25:22,711 --> 00:25:25,180
(laughing)

315
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,183
- Mind telling me where you picked it up?

316
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:32,870
- In town, it was abandoned.

317
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:33,703
- How long ago?

318
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,783
- Not long, a couple weeks.

319
00:25:46,059 --> 00:25:48,903
Well thank you, sir.

320
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:26,059
(suspenseful orchestral music)

321
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:52,402
(lock clicking)

322
00:27:03,153 --> 00:27:03,986
- Okay.

323
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:11,410
Nice carwash.

324
00:27:21,191 --> 00:27:23,941
(seat squishing)

325
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:33,560
(glass breaking)

326
00:27:34,661 --> 00:27:35,914
Wait, wait, wait!

327
00:27:35,914 --> 00:27:40,271
(intense orchestral music)
(screaming)

328
00:27:40,271 --> 00:27:42,521
(grunting)

329
00:27:54,657 --> 00:27:56,407
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

330
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:00,422
(grunting)

331
00:28:00,422 --> 00:28:02,422
- Stupid son of a bitch!

332
00:28:06,738 --> 00:28:09,802
(drill whirring)

333
00:28:09,802 --> 00:28:11,180
Tell me, Duane.

334
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,558
Nine yards worth.

335
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:14,450
- You're trespassing, man.

336
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:16,160
I come back for my wallet,

337
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,880
and I found you breaking into my--

338
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,024
- Tell me about the blood.

339
00:28:20,024 --> 00:28:21,128
- Blood?

340
00:28:21,128 --> 00:28:23,130
What the fuck are you talking about?

341
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:24,683
- [Ray] Inside the Mazda.

342
00:28:25,524 --> 00:28:26,383
- You're out of your mind.

343
00:28:26,383 --> 00:28:28,680
I ain't never once been in that truck.

344
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,830
Never once, you asshole.

345
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:32,640
- Don't rope me, you little gink.

346
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,648
I pull this trigger, you'll be backin' up

347
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:35,683
the urinals the rest of your life.

348
00:28:36,663 --> 00:28:38,730
(muttering)

349
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:39,950
What?

350
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,243
- I said,

351
00:28:41,243 --> 00:28:45,703
you won't do it, man.

352
00:28:45,703 --> 00:28:48,079
(drill whirring)
(screaming)

353
00:28:48,079 --> 00:28:49,082
I just pick em' up!

354
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:54,082
He tells me to, I just pick em' up!

355
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,873
- He?

356
00:28:55,873 --> 00:28:56,706
Who's he?

357
00:29:07,035 --> 00:29:09,085
Got anything to drink around here, Duane?

358
00:29:13,381 --> 00:29:14,881
- Now, you listen,

359
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,603
now just like I said,

360
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,458
he calls me up, he tells
me what year and make,

361
00:29:22,458 --> 00:29:23,596
and where to find it.

362
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,750
And you know it shows up,
it's right there abandoned.

363
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:30,150
So, tow em' in, and we send out notices,

364
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:33,420
and Eileen auctions them off in 90 days.

365
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,253
- Who's he?

366
00:29:35,354 --> 00:29:36,950
- I don't know.

367
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:38,470
I ain't never seen him.

368
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,480
- How'd you meet him?

369
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,740
- [Duane] He calls me up.

370
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,893
- How'd he get your number?

371
00:29:42,893 --> 00:29:45,550
- Fuckin' Yellow Pages, I don't know.

372
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:47,043
- How'd you get his cut?

373
00:29:49,894 --> 00:29:51,449
- He don't take no cut.

374
00:29:51,449 --> 00:29:53,420
(laughing)

375
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,563
- He just unloads cars.

376
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,450
- Hey.

377
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,140
Hey this is all legal, man.

378
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,973
- It's legal,

379
00:29:59,973 --> 00:30:02,060
if you've got Shredded Wheat for brains.

380
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,370
Haven't you ever wondered why these cars

381
00:30:03,370 --> 00:30:04,203
don't have owners,

382
00:30:04,203 --> 00:30:05,655
why nobody picks them up?

383
00:30:05,655 --> 00:30:06,740
- Now,

384
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,550
see this guy, and maybe
we got an arrangement.

385
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,190
You see, he don't take no cut.

386
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:13,596
- And you don't ask any questions.

387
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:17,628
You fuck.

388
00:30:17,628 --> 00:30:18,578
- I mean would you?

389
00:30:20,598 --> 00:30:23,493
- Yeah, Duane, I would.

390
00:30:26,192 --> 00:30:29,140
(sighing)

391
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,543
- Okay, so,

392
00:30:31,472 --> 00:30:33,980
what are we saying here?

393
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:36,076
- So, what are we saying here?

394
00:30:36,076 --> 00:30:37,520
(chuckling)

395
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:40,230
What I'm saying here is
next time he calls you,

396
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:41,930
you call me and call me soon, Duane,

397
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,390
I don't hear from you soon, Duane,

398
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:45,520
cops will be so far down your throat

399
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,941
you'll be crapping blue.

400
00:30:46,941 --> 00:30:50,858
(suspenseful orchestral music)

401
00:30:54,285 --> 00:30:57,285
(spooky whispering)

402
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,636
(intense drum music)

403
00:31:07,636 --> 00:31:10,636
(breathing heavily)

404
00:31:12,969 --> 00:31:15,219
(grunting)

405
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,976
(gasping)

406
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:26,197
(spooky whispering)

407
00:31:29,027 --> 00:31:32,150
(phone ringing)

408
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,773
Ray Tattinger, how can I help?

409
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,180
- [Duane] He called.

410
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,540
Now listen to me.

411
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:40,340
I want this car man,
because it just sounds

412
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,830
too good to be true.

413
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,663
- [Ray] Tell me.

414
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:48,670
- [Duane] It's a Porsche
924, red, S-T-H-9-2-1.

415
00:31:49,723 --> 00:31:50,556
- [Ray] Address?

416
00:31:50,556 --> 00:31:52,100
- [Duane] Now I gotta
make this pick up man,

417
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,550
otherwise he ain't gonna call me no more

418
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,180
and I lose out on the whole shebang.

419
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,290
- [Ray] You can tow tomorrow morning

420
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:57,477
after I look at it.

421
00:31:57,477 --> 00:31:58,377
- [Duane] Now look, that's not the--

422
00:31:58,377 --> 00:32:00,123
- [Ray] The address, Duane.

423
00:32:01,570 --> 00:32:05,629
- [Duane] 900 Ravenwood,
it's north of Everett.

424
00:32:05,629 --> 00:32:09,462
(mysterious orchestral music)

425
00:32:49,605 --> 00:32:53,522
(suspenseful orchestral music)

426
00:33:04,158 --> 00:33:05,908
- Oh please, come on.

427
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:14,044
God, let me go home.

428
00:33:14,044 --> 00:33:17,627
(intense orchestral music)

429
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,973
(screaming)

430
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:43,969
(breathing heavily)

431
00:33:46,850 --> 00:33:51,850
(knife stabbing)
(grunting)

432
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:55,248
(whispering)

433
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:12,840
- [Goldie] Hi, Nora.

434
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,840
- Hey.

435
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,180
- Still need a ride?

436
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,086
- Yeah.

437
00:34:16,086 --> 00:34:18,500
My car won't be ready
for a couple of days.

438
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,105
- Okay.

439
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:22,440
- Do you mind if we swing
by Alamo Street first?

440
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:23,540
- No great, let's go.

441
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:24,373
- Okay.

442
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:26,580
- I've had it.

443
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,580
If I don't make a sale soon,
I'm getting out of real estate.

444
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,750
This is definitely not one
of my neighborhoods, Nora.

445
00:34:34,930 --> 00:34:37,630
- 721 Alamo Street, it's gotta be here.

446
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,460
- Well, maybe it's in
the executive washroom.

447
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,293
- Here we go.

448
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:43,453
Whoa.
- Oh.

449
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:50,030
- Hi, can I help you?

450
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,603
- Looking for Ray Tattinger.

451
00:34:51,603 --> 00:34:52,436
(chuckling)

452
00:34:52,436 --> 00:34:53,966
- He owe you money?

453
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,388
- Not exactly.

454
00:34:55,388 --> 00:34:56,923
- I thought you gave him 500 bucks.

455
00:34:56,923 --> 00:34:59,322
- I didn't give it to
him, it was a retainer.

456
00:34:59,322 --> 00:35:01,527
(chuckling)

457
00:35:01,527 --> 00:35:03,620
- Well congratulations, lady.

458
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:06,310
You are the latest and
the greatest contributor

459
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:09,473
to the Ray Tattinger
early retirement fund.

460
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,120
- Are you saying he moved?

461
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,070
- I'm saying he split.

462
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,570
Took off about a week
ago, never came back.

463
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,023
Don't expect he will neither.

464
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,223
Tell you what,

465
00:35:20,223 --> 00:35:21,860
the Salvation Army's coming in.

466
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,850
Why don't you take what
you want, you know,

467
00:35:24,850 --> 00:35:25,733
cut your losses.

468
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,283
500 bucks, wow.

469
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,470
- Nora, you don't want any of this crap.

470
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,230
- I want the picture.

471
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:42,536
- What picture?

472
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:43,536
- The one of Julian.

473
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:50,722
I got it.

474
00:35:53,837 --> 00:35:54,670
Look.

475
00:35:57,997 --> 00:35:59,880
- Maybe he forgot to cash it.

476
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,470
- Would you leave your
money all over town?

477
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:03,696
- Are you insane?

478
00:36:03,696 --> 00:36:04,846
I gotta get outta here.

479
00:36:13,933 --> 00:36:16,350
(rock music)

480
00:36:25,801 --> 00:36:28,051
(laughing)

481
00:37:09,618 --> 00:37:12,290
(screaming)

482
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:13,470
- [Newscaster] In the Lancaster area

483
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,210
where the grizzly discovery was made,

484
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,650
the remains, believed to be
male 25 to 40 years of age,

485
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:20,220
have been removed by the county coroners

486
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,120
who will attempt to identify the body.

487
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:25,710
The five day forecast of
cold nights and sunny days

488
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:27,410
will continue throughout the week.

489
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,473
- [Man On Phone] Directory assistance.

490
00:37:34,473 --> 00:37:36,343
- [Nora] The number to
the coroner's office?

491
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,523
- [Man On Phone] 5-5-5-2-9-7-8.

492
00:37:41,199 --> 00:37:43,866
(phone dialing)

493
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,130
- [Woman On Phone] County coroner.

494
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,240
- I'm calling regarding the body

495
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,990
that was reported on the news?

496
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:52,640
- [Woman On Phone] All I can
tell you over the telephone

497
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,320
is he's a male Hispanic.

498
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,110
For more information
you can come down here

499
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,990
between the hours of eight and five.

500
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:58,823
- No thanks.

501
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,370
- [Goldie] I'm almost
positive this address

502
00:38:12,370 --> 00:38:14,970
was in the new multiple listing book.

503
00:38:14,970 --> 00:38:16,843
Even in the dark it looks great.

504
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:19,460
What a commission this would be.

505
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,640
- So this would have to be it.

506
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,680
Only one Ravenwood on the map.

507
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,100
But why did he write it down?

508
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,920
Could be from a different case.

509
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,410
- Wonder if we could do a walkthrough.

510
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,460
- I wonder if we could get a closer look.

511
00:38:42,090 --> 00:38:43,110
- Don't you have the key,

512
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,710
aren't you the real estate lady?

513
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,360
- Yeah?

514
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:51,010
- And Mr. Chase didn't leave
you the key to the gate?

515
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,150
- He told us he would leave us a key,

516
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:56,870
but he forgot it, so like him.

517
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:59,130
- I'm sure he wouldn't
mind if you let us in.

518
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,300
Would he?

519
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,253
- Yeah, no problem.

520
00:39:18,411 --> 00:39:19,411
- [Nora] So?

521
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:25,053
- It's locked, let's look around.

522
00:39:28,739 --> 00:39:32,572
(mysterious orchestral music)

523
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,100
(grunting)

524
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:53,150
Nobody's home, look around for a lockbox.

525
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,600
- I did, I couldn't find one.

526
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:57,880
- Oh great, I love breaking into houses.

527
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,620
You know, this works on some doors.

528
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:02,320
If you just slip this
into this thingy here,

529
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,360
push it down, pull it out.

530
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,423
Voila, access.

531
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:08,893
Don't you have a gold card?

532
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:14,650
- Did you hear something inside?

533
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,483
- Such as?

534
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:17,673
- I don't know.

535
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,280
- [Leslie] The Sedan, it's yours?

536
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,466
- Uh, the blue one, yes, mine, ours, mine.

537
00:40:28,466 --> 00:40:29,870
- Just the two of you?

538
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:31,510
- Just us.

539
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,920
I'm Goldie and this is--

540
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,410
- The gardener let you in?

541
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,170
- Look, I'm a realtor.

542
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,810
We were just out canvasing the area,

543
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,760
looking for some new listings.

544
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,320
The gardener thought we were someone else

545
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,570
and we took advantage of the mistake

546
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,530
by peeking in a few windows, that's all.

547
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,010
We were just admiring your house.

548
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,893
You are selling.

549
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,008
- I am.

550
00:40:54,008 --> 00:40:54,860
- Great.

551
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:58,430
My company represents a
very exclusive clientele

552
00:40:58,430 --> 00:40:59,670
and I would love to sit down

553
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,560
and talk to you sometime.

554
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,583
- I have a broker.

555
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,060
- Just in case you change your mind?

556
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,610
- The man has a broker, Goldie.

557
00:41:23,767 --> 00:41:26,017
- You'll have to excuse me.

558
00:41:29,990 --> 00:41:32,360
It's not everyday I
find two beautiful women

559
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,773
prowling around my house, you threw me.

560
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:38,283
- Well I can understand that.

561
00:41:39,287 --> 00:41:42,970
- For the record, the house
isn't an exclusive listing.

562
00:41:42,970 --> 00:41:45,123
Since I am interested in a quick sale,

563
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,670
perhaps we should talk.

564
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,423
Goldie, was it?

565
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,023
- Still is.

566
00:41:56,067 --> 00:41:57,620
- If you got a minute,
why don't you come inside?

567
00:41:57,620 --> 00:42:00,017
You can poke around to
your heart's content.

568
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,273
Please, won't you join us?

569
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:28,290
(ominous orchestral music)

570
00:42:46,704 --> 00:42:49,704
(breathing heavily)

571
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:57,891
no, please no more.

572
00:43:01,024 --> 00:43:02,357
You're not here.

573
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:05,483
I am.

574
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,480
Go away!

575
00:43:18,561 --> 00:43:19,394
(grunting)

576
00:43:19,394 --> 00:43:20,227
(glass breaking)

577
00:43:20,227 --> 00:43:21,739
(mysterious orchestral music)

578
00:43:21,739 --> 00:43:24,739
(breathing heavily)

579
00:43:29,345 --> 00:43:33,012
(dramatic orchestral music)

580
00:44:02,421 --> 00:44:05,338
(metal clattering)

581
00:44:12,965 --> 00:44:16,882
(suspenseful orchestral music)

582
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:45,920
(groaning)

583
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,503
(intense orchestral music)

584
00:44:55,486 --> 00:44:57,736
(grunting)

585
00:45:10,848 --> 00:45:13,098
(grunting)

586
00:45:20,921 --> 00:45:23,921
(breathing heavily)

587
00:45:29,743 --> 00:45:33,326
(intense orchestral music)

588
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:38,457
(yelling)

589
00:46:02,777 --> 00:46:05,110
(screaming)

590
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:11,884
(knife stabbing)
(gagging)

591
00:46:23,138 --> 00:46:25,805
(water running)

592
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:49,750
You're very adept at that.

593
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:53,906
Forgive me, I didn't mean to startle you.

594
00:46:53,906 --> 00:46:55,500
- How did you get in?

595
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,541
- The backdoor was unlocked.

596
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:58,374
- It was?

597
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:02,243
- Chase, Leslie Chase.

598
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:04,790
- Yes, I remember.

599
00:47:11,809 --> 00:47:14,293
- It's a great place.

600
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:15,337
Imagine my surprise to find out

601
00:47:15,337 --> 00:47:17,663
that you're not in real estate.

602
00:47:19,360 --> 00:47:21,400
- Actually Goldie and I are old friends,

603
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,370
I was just along for the ride.

604
00:47:22,370 --> 00:47:23,703
- I see.

605
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:29,503
Almost forgot.

606
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,695
I found this by the door at my house.

607
00:47:32,695 --> 00:47:36,278
(ominous orchestral music)

608
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,420
You really should be more careful.

609
00:47:47,482 --> 00:47:49,254
- Mrs. Hardwick, good morning.

610
00:47:49,254 --> 00:47:51,580
(chuckling)

611
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:52,510
Still no tulips?

612
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:55,463
- Few weeks yet hun, I've
brought you some roses.

613
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,700
Last longer anyway.

614
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,499
- Always a saleslady.

615
00:48:01,499 --> 00:48:04,633
- [Mrs. Hardwick] Any word yet
from your young man, Julian?

616
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,350
- Not yet.

617
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:09,253
- Don't you dare give up on him.

618
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,640
- Does that sound like me?

619
00:48:12,730 --> 00:48:15,093
- No, I imagine it doesn't.

620
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:16,833
(chuckling)

621
00:48:16,833 --> 00:48:18,370
Nope, nope, nope, nope.

622
00:48:18,370 --> 00:48:19,203
- Please.

623
00:48:19,203 --> 00:48:20,036
Please Mrs. Hardwick.

624
00:48:20,036 --> 00:48:21,450
Let's not go through
this again Mrs. Hardwick,

625
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:22,590
take the money.

626
00:48:22,590 --> 00:48:24,613
- Just come visit me sometime.

627
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,880
- Still over on Lion's Road?

628
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,230
- Same address for 32 years,

629
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:32,686
imagine I'll die there.

630
00:48:32,686 --> 00:48:34,256
(laughing)

631
00:48:34,256 --> 00:48:36,740
- See if I can't stop by first.

632
00:48:36,740 --> 00:48:37,737
- Fair enough.

633
00:48:47,638 --> 00:48:51,305
(dramatic orchestral music)

634
00:48:56,054 --> 00:48:58,040
- Showed some Polaroids
around the office today.

635
00:48:58,040 --> 00:49:00,030
Everyone says that house is a giveaway

636
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,310
at $750,000.

637
00:49:02,310 --> 00:49:04,823
I'm gonna have to ask
Leslie if he'll come up.

638
00:49:06,396 --> 00:49:08,460
- Has he even mentioned Ray Tattinger?

639
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,080
- No, but I'll ask him tonight

640
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:10,980
if you want me to.

641
00:49:13,777 --> 00:49:14,930
- Tonight?

642
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:17,332
- Yeah, he called to ask if I was free.

643
00:49:17,332 --> 00:49:18,610
(laughing)

644
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:19,447
I said,

645
00:49:19,447 --> 00:49:22,337
"Maybe cheap, but never free."

646
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:25,370
- You're seeing Chase socially?

647
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,233
- Honey, business.

648
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:32,090
- That doesn't look too tax deductible.

649
00:49:32,090 --> 00:49:33,920
- Well, I just wanted to wear it.

650
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,670
I don't get many chances, you know.

651
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:38,230
- [Nora] Listen Goldie,
there's something about Chase

652
00:49:38,230 --> 00:49:39,063
you should know--

653
00:49:39,063 --> 00:49:40,250
- No, I know everything.

654
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:42,030
I ran a credit check on him,

655
00:49:42,030 --> 00:49:43,392
Leslie Christian Chase.

656
00:49:43,392 --> 00:49:46,950
Came up unmarried and incredibly wealthy.

657
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:50,363
So for me, life ceases to be an issue.

658
00:49:50,363 --> 00:49:51,196
- [Nora] Listen, he--

659
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,620
(knocking on door)

660
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,263
- He's here, let him in.

661
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:56,063
- [Nora] You're dressed.

662
00:49:56,063 --> 00:49:57,450
- I know, I want to make an entrance.

663
00:49:57,450 --> 00:49:58,376

I don't want to see her hurt.

- So she hired a detective

687
00:51:24,630 --> 00:51:26,483
and then he split on her.

688
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:28,990
- She went to the police?

689
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,290
- Yeah, but,

690
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:33,400
they told her the same thing that I did.

691
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,520
That Julian would come home

692
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:37,253
when and if he was good and ready.

693
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,720
But you gotta understand Nora, I mean,

694
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,780
she was seriously in love.

695
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:44,900
This is a girl who didn't wash the sheets

696
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:47,210
for a month after Julian left.

697
00:51:47,210 --> 00:51:49,160
She didn't want to wash his scent away.

698
00:51:50,283 --> 00:51:53,100
- But she thinks something
serious happened to him?

699
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:54,610
- I guess so.

700
00:51:54,610 --> 00:51:56,760
I guess it's easier
for her pride that way.

701
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,723
Oh, goodbye Mr. Diet.

702
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:04,400
- You look wonderful in blue,

703
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,513
have I told you that?

704
00:52:10,670 --> 00:52:13,580
- Hey, you don't want
any of these critters?

705
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,430
- I'm trying to cut down on red meat.

706
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:21,124
Save room for dessert.

707
00:52:21,124 --> 00:52:24,957
(mysterious orchestral music)

708
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:38,090
- [Ray] The guys at the LCC
site said he worked there.

709
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:41,960
The gal at the office said he didn't,

710
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,460
or at least she couldn't
find any paperwork on it.

711
00:52:55,945 --> 00:52:57,028
- [Nora] LCC.

712
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,453
Leslie Christian Chase.

713
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:29,374
(door clicking)

714
00:53:29,374 --> 00:53:31,010
- Hey.

715
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:31,843
Where you going?

716
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:34,930
- My cars ready, finally.

717
00:53:36,170 --> 00:53:38,380
- Oh, you gonna walk to the shop?

718
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:39,300
- Taxi.

719
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,301
- Why didn't you come and get me?

720
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,298
- Well,

721
00:53:42,298 --> 00:53:45,100
I know you got back
pretty late last night.

722
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,050
So how did it go?

723
00:53:46,050 --> 00:53:47,927
- Oh, what a guy.

724
00:53:47,927 --> 00:53:51,080
He goes around the world
building all these buildings.

725
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:52,010
He's done a lot of things,

726
00:53:52,010 --> 00:53:53,990
you know that scar he's got on his neck?

727
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:55,960
I'm sure you've noticed,
it's his only flaw.

728
00:53:55,960 --> 00:53:57,640
Well he got that during a fight

729
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:01,570
with some Indian warrior
in Santa Del something,

730
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:04,060
I don't know, it was the
jungle somewhere, right?

731
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,280
I mean who do we know that's
ever been to the jungle,

732
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,760
let alone attacked by the natives.

733
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:09,913
I was impressed.

734
00:54:11,380 --> 00:54:12,970
- I can see.

735
00:54:12,970 --> 00:54:17,273
A Native American spokesman
denies any tribal involvement.

736
00:54:17,273 --> 00:54:18,190
W. Dykstra.

737
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:27,415
Hey, Mrs. Dysktra?

738
00:54:27,415 --> 00:54:28,330
- Yeah, who are you?

739
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:30,050
- Nora Weeks, got a minute?

740
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:30,883
- How?

741
00:54:30,883 --> 00:54:33,260
- I read your stories,
four bodies discovered--

742
00:54:33,260 --> 00:54:34,093
- Five.

743
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:36,490
- A fifth body?

744
00:54:36,490 --> 00:54:38,510
- Look, I'm a little crazy here.

745
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:40,520
- Wait, my husband's missing.

746
00:54:40,520 --> 00:54:42,120
I know something's happened to him,

747
00:54:42,120 --> 00:54:43,531
and there's no one to help me.

748
00:54:43,531 --> 00:54:46,380
Please tell me what you know.

749
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:48,330
- Okay, let me give it to you straight.

750
00:54:49,310 --> 00:54:51,710
Each of the victims had
their ankle tendons cut.

751
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,320
- That hasn't been in the paper.

752
00:54:55,210 --> 00:54:57,170
- Sometimes we're asked
to suppress certain facts

753
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,810
that are relevant to the case.

754
00:54:58,810 --> 00:55:01,280
Like something the murderer might know?

755
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,110
It's a clever idea, really.

756
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:04,660
I mean a victim can't run away.

757
00:55:05,530 --> 00:55:06,610
But there's just no history

758
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:08,780
of that kind of mutilation
in our local tribes,

759
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,230
there's just no history of...

760
00:55:11,870 --> 00:55:13,104
- But what?

761
00:55:13,104 --> 00:55:15,536
(ominous orchestral music)

762
00:55:15,536 --> 00:55:16,536
- All right.

763
00:55:17,410 --> 00:55:19,580
My source indicated to me off the record

764
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,540
that they found some rather
unexpected marks on the femur

765
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:26,250
of the latest victim.

766
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:27,650
- Marks, what kind of marks?

767
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,263
- Tooth marks.

768
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:32,653
- Animal?

769
00:55:33,652 --> 00:55:38,652
- Human.

770
00:55:39,460 --> 00:55:41,687
- In Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica,

771
00:55:41,687 --> 00:55:43,620
the Totec believed that men was born

772
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:44,960
from the flesh of the dead.

773
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,250
It was the nourishment of their existence,

774
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:50,500
and for 20 days based on
their sacred ritual calendar,

775
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,650
a human sacrifice was to be made.

776
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:54,530
A chieftain would select a victim,

777
00:55:54,530 --> 00:55:57,960
have him stripped, painted
blue, the sacrificial color

778
00:55:57,960 --> 00:56:00,290
and led them to the temple of the jaguar.

779
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:03,300
The chief will make
offerings of his own blood

780
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,230
to the tribe, drinking it just prior

781
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:06,763
to executing the victim.

782
00:56:07,643 --> 00:56:08,970
With the heart still beating,

783
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:12,053
the body was flayed, and the
flesh eaten by the tribesmen.

784
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,378
Hunted to extinction,

785
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:18,864
no survivors of this ancient civilization

786
00:56:18,864 --> 00:56:20,447
are known to exist.

787
00:56:38,023 --> 00:56:41,060
Totec Chieftain, Santa Del Sol, Mexico.

788
00:56:43,761 --> 00:56:47,344
(intense orchestral music)

789
00:57:11,295 --> 00:57:13,962
(book thudding)

790
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,798
(eerie ambient music)

791
00:57:54,034 --> 00:57:54,867
(knocking on door)

792
00:57:54,867 --> 00:57:57,867
(hairdryer blowing)

793
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:02,660
Why don't you answer?

794
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:05,040
- [Goldie] Had a hairdryer in my ear.

795
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,490
- [Nora] You're going out with Chase?

796
00:58:06,490 --> 00:58:08,110
- Uh huh.

797
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:10,360
- [Nora] You can't, he's dangerous.

798
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:13,030
Well so am I in this dress.

799
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:15,810
Look at this, Russian sable.

800
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:17,350
Feel it, there's only a hundred coats

801
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:18,310
like this in the world,

802
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:20,220
and guess who gave it to me?

803
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,320
- And you accepted it?

804
00:58:23,156 --> 00:58:24,270
Did he tell you he came to see me

805
00:58:24,270 --> 00:58:25,670
before he went out with you?

806
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:28,823
He's using you to get to me.

807
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,560
- Oh really?

808
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:34,553
'Cause he couldn't possibly
be interested in just me?

809
00:58:35,560 --> 00:58:37,223
- I didn't say that.

810
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,480
Goldie, you've known him for a few weeks.

811
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:44,710
We known each other for years,

812
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:46,670
I wouldn't lie to you.

813
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,470
You know the bodies they're digging up?

814
00:58:48,470 --> 00:58:50,920
They all have ankle tendons cut.

815
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:52,550
- What are you talking about?

816
00:58:52,550 --> 00:58:54,860
- Chase told you he built
a hotel in Mexico, right?

817
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:55,800
- Yeah.

818
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:56,700
- There were rumors at the time

819
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:58,680
that he built it on the
sacred land of the Totec,

820
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,280
did he tell you that?

821
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:01,980
Did he tell you about the tendons?

822
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:05,983
- Totecs, tendons?

823
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:09,556
(laughing)

824
00:59:09,556 --> 00:59:10,433
Whoa.

825
00:59:22,420 --> 00:59:23,253
- Listen to this.

826
00:59:23,253 --> 00:59:24,971
"Amongst the last predatory tribes

827
00:59:24,971 --> 00:59:26,717
"of Central America was the Totecs.

828
00:59:26,717 --> 00:59:28,127
"Unique in their death rituals,

829
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,187
"disabling their victim
by the precise severing

830
00:59:30,187 --> 00:59:32,130
"of the ankle tendons."

831
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:34,900
Goldie, these bodies, they
had their flesh removed

832
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,200
and they found human
tooth marks on the bones.

833
00:59:38,330 --> 00:59:40,043
- So you're suggesting,

834
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:42,200
no, no Nora.

835
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:44,089
Don't even say it.

836
00:59:44,089 --> 00:59:46,172
- It's obvious, isn't it?

837
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:48,940
- Listen to yourself.

838
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:50,940
Leslie Chase, he's got everything.

839
00:59:50,940 --> 00:59:54,150
He's got cash, he's got
cars, he's got a great house,

840
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:56,180
he's got a job that takes
him around the world.

841
00:59:56,180 --> 00:59:58,640
Why would he need to kill someone?

842
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:00,210
- What about Ray Tattinger?

843
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,120
Christ, it's like

844
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,400
he ends where Chase begins.

845
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,233
And you didn't even--

846
01:00:04,233 --> 01:00:05,210
- I asked.

847
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:06,880
Leslie never met him.

848
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:08,040
- What about Julian?

849
01:00:08,040 --> 01:00:09,380
He was working construction

850
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:10,990
for the company called LCC.

851
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:11,830
Ring a bell?

852
01:00:11,830 --> 01:00:13,663
Leslie Christian Chase.

853
01:00:18,700 --> 01:00:20,270
- He's late.

854
01:00:20,270 --> 01:00:21,333
He's never late.

855
01:00:22,950 --> 01:00:26,030
- I hope I'm wrong for
about 10 different reasons.

856
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:28,200
Not the least of which is Julian.

857
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,070
But please Goldie, stay away from him

858
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:31,270
until we know I'm wrong.

859
01:00:35,187 --> 01:00:38,104
(knocking on door)

860
01:00:42,380 --> 01:00:43,393
- Lock up for me?

861
01:00:44,600 --> 01:00:45,433
- Goldie.

862
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,860
- I think he really likes me, honey.

863
01:00:51,860 --> 01:00:52,753
I really do.

864
01:00:57,790 --> 01:00:59,196
Hi.

865
01:00:59,196 --> 01:01:00,613
- [Leslie] Hello.

866
01:01:01,640 --> 01:01:03,670
- So what are we doing tonight?

867
01:01:03,670 --> 01:01:05,820
- There's a cocktail
party I should attend.

868
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:10,313
- How about if we skip it
and go back to your place?

869
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:16,273
(chuckling)

870
01:01:20,755 --> 01:01:23,422
(door clicking)

871
01:01:26,042 --> 01:01:29,625
(ominous orchestral music)

872
01:01:33,434 --> 01:01:37,017
(sensual orchestral music)

873
01:01:46,179 --> 01:01:49,179
(breathing heavily)

874
01:01:50,613 --> 01:01:52,780
(gasping)

875
01:02:05,324 --> 01:02:07,491
(moaning)

876
01:02:43,873 --> 01:02:46,729
(ominous orchestral music)

877
01:02:46,729 --> 01:02:48,896
(moaning)

878
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:54,892
(screaming)

879
01:02:57,140 --> 01:02:58,760
- [Woman On Phone] Nobody's
seen or heard from her

880
01:02:58,760 --> 01:02:59,960
for a couple of days now.

881
01:02:59,960 --> 01:03:03,050
- She didn't say anything
about leaving, quitting?

882
01:03:03,050 --> 01:03:04,700
- [Woman On Phone] No, not to us.

883
01:03:06,380 --> 01:03:07,800
- She was in the middle of a deal.

884
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,450
- [Woman On Phone] You mean
the place out on Ravenwood?

885
01:03:09,450 --> 01:03:10,283
- Yes.

886
01:03:10,283 --> 01:03:11,313
- [Woman On Phone] Well, that sold.

887
01:03:23,895 --> 01:03:26,395
(dog barking)

888
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:41,243
- Goldie?

889
01:03:44,141 --> 01:03:46,214
(knocking on door)

890
01:03:46,214 --> 01:03:47,047
Goldie?

891
01:04:01,824 --> 01:04:04,741
(knocking on door)

892
01:04:08,592 --> 01:04:11,110
(glass breaking)

893
01:04:11,110 --> 01:04:15,027
(suspenseful orchestral music)

894
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,958
(gasping)

895
01:05:22,665 --> 01:05:23,498
I've gotta talk to the Lieutenant.

896
01:05:23,498 --> 01:05:24,935
- You can't, he's busy.

897
01:05:24,935 --> 01:05:25,768
Hey.

898
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:33,050
- Do you know a man named Leslie Chase?

899
01:05:33,050 --> 01:05:34,300
- Mrs. Weeks.

900
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,810
- Do you?

901
01:05:35,810 --> 01:05:39,173
- The developer, lives over
on Ravenwood, about 35, 40.

902
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,340
Standing right behind you.

903
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:46,083
- Hello, Nora.

904
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:49,100
Just making a few final arrangements

905
01:05:49,100 --> 01:05:50,570
with Lieutenant Fladboe here.

906
01:05:50,570 --> 01:05:52,850
He's agreed to keep an eye on the house

907
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,850
while it's In Escrow.

908
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,650
- Do you know this woman?

909
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:56,503
- Yes, she's,

910
01:05:58,060 --> 01:05:59,840
how do I put this tactfully,

911
01:05:59,840 --> 01:06:00,910
former lover.

912
01:06:00,910 --> 01:06:02,370
- [Nora] I'm not your God damn lover!

913
01:06:02,370 --> 01:06:04,340
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, jumpin' Jesus,

914
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:05,950
what the hell is going on here?

915
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,660
- I'd prefer if we
could solve our problems

916
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:08,620
in private, Nora,

917
01:06:08,620 --> 01:06:09,511
not put them on display like this

918
01:06:09,511 --> 01:06:10,860
in front of a judge.

919
01:06:10,860 --> 01:06:11,960
- He's a murderer.

920
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:13,340
I told you my husband's missing.

921
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:14,810
I hire Ray Tattinger to find him,

922
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,030
now he's gone too.

923
01:06:16,030 --> 01:06:17,440
- Lady, apparently you're the only one

924
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:18,460
who didn't know.

925
01:06:18,460 --> 01:06:19,640
Ray is a flake.

926
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,040
Probably moved his little operation

927
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:22,600
to another town by now.

928
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:24,920
- Okay, well, my best girlfriend--

929
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:25,883
- Goldie's fine.

930
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,860
We're vacationing together, or will be.

931
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,484
I'll be joining her as
soon as I wrap up a--

932
01:06:31,484 --> 01:06:32,317
- Bullshit.

933
01:06:32,317 --> 01:06:33,920
Why didn't you take her coat?

934
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:34,753
- The fur?

935
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,380
It's a little warm in Hawaii.

936
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,370
- Let's call her.

937
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,380
If she's in Hawaii, let's
get her on the phone.

938
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,050
I want to talk to Goldie now.

939
01:06:43,050 --> 01:06:44,343
- I don't think that's possible.

940
01:06:44,343 --> 01:06:46,208
- Because you're lying.

941
01:06:46,208 --> 01:06:48,835
- Because I believe she
has a sailing lesson

942
01:06:48,835 --> 01:06:50,480
'til about five.

943
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:51,313
- He's the guy.

944
01:06:51,313 --> 01:06:53,130
He's the one who is
putting all those bodies

945
01:06:53,130 --> 01:06:54,330
out there in the fields.

946
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,460
I know, I've been to his house.

947
01:06:56,460 --> 01:06:57,510
I found blood.

948
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:00,059
- Mrs. Weeks, real calm now.

949
01:07:00,059 --> 01:07:02,028
Why do you say he's killing people,

950
01:07:02,028 --> 01:07:04,129
and why is he doing it?

951
01:07:04,129 --> 01:07:05,293
- Because--

952
01:07:05,293 --> 01:07:06,853
- This should be interesting.

953
01:07:09,027 --> 01:07:10,750
- Because he's--

954
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:11,583
- Yes?

955
01:07:14,887 --> 01:07:16,637
- You son of a bitch!

956
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,910
- I usually like to keep
personal matters personal,

957
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:24,373
but this is a bad situation.

958
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:29,000
Involvement, she and her best friend,

959
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:30,620
you know how they get.

960
01:07:30,620 --> 01:07:32,707
They'll say anything to get back at you.

961
01:07:32,707 --> 01:07:33,957
- Yeah, I know.

962
01:07:47,885 --> 01:07:51,802
(suspenseful orchestral music)

963
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:55,878
(tape rewinding)

964
01:07:55,878 --> 01:07:57,050
- [Goldie] Aloha!

965
01:07:57,050 --> 01:07:59,040
I'm in Hawaii honey, do you believe it?

966
01:07:59,040 --> 01:08:01,300
Leslie sold the house
through another agent so

967
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,580
I lost the sale but I got the guy.

968
01:08:03,580 --> 01:08:05,870
Uh look, Nora,

969
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:07,010
I should've left you a note,

970
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:08,340
I'm sorry if you got worried okay?

971
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:10,370
I'll make it up to you when I get back.

972
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:11,620
If I get back.

973
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:14,621
I'm not sure if this is a
vacation or a retirement.

974
01:08:14,621 --> 01:08:16,223
I'll try you later, honey.

975
01:08:19,016 --> 01:08:19,849
(machine beeping)

976
01:08:19,849 --> 01:08:23,073
- Nora, maybe now you'll listen to reason.

977
01:08:24,290 --> 01:08:27,471
We need to talk, away from things.

978
01:08:27,471 --> 01:08:30,800
At the wildlife sanctuary
at the state park.

979
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:32,573
Tomorrow, sunrise.

980
01:09:04,260 --> 01:09:05,460
Quite a place, isn't it?

981
01:09:07,540 --> 01:09:09,143
I'm one of its patron saints.

982
01:09:10,180 --> 01:09:13,373
I have my name on a plaque, somewhere.

983
01:09:20,350 --> 01:09:21,300
I'll be leaving soon,

984
01:09:21,300 --> 01:09:22,590
but I wanted to see if we couldn't

985
01:09:22,590 --> 01:09:24,513
work out our situation first.

986
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:28,140
- I have nothing to work out with you.

987
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:29,280
- Are you sure of that?

988
01:09:29,280 --> 01:09:30,660
- Positive.

989
01:09:30,660 --> 01:09:32,060
You wanted to talk, so talk.

990
01:09:38,810 --> 01:09:40,860
- I've never spoken about this to anyone.

991
01:09:42,830 --> 01:09:45,950
Dying Totec chieftain will
breathe his final breath

992
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:48,350
into the mouth of his successor.

993
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:51,993
His spirit has passed on in that breath,

994
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:54,883
that last gasp.

995
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,120
Along with the souls of all the chieftains

996
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:01,190
who have come before him.

997
01:10:01,190 --> 01:10:05,853
Years ago, I became that
which I sought to destroy.

998
01:10:07,740 --> 01:10:09,830
In order to preserve the
lineage of their souls,

999
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,290
they keep me alive.

1000
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:13,150
And they have needs,

1001
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:16,050
needs which must be satisfied.

1002
01:10:16,050 --> 01:10:18,210
- Interesting mythology.

1003
01:10:18,210 --> 01:10:19,153
- It's no myth.

1004
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:26,563
I need your silence.

1005
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,644
And I'm willing to bargain for it.

1006
01:10:31,644 --> 01:10:32,870
- You have nothing I want.

1007
01:10:32,870 --> 01:10:34,120
- I have Goldie.

1008
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:35,510
And if you want her to live,

1009
01:10:35,510 --> 01:10:36,710
there could be no more episodes

1010
01:10:36,710 --> 01:10:37,830
like the one yesterday.

1011
01:10:37,830 --> 01:10:41,083
No police, no accusations, ever.

1012
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:00,820
- You killed Ray Tattinger?

1013
01:11:02,582 --> 01:11:03,915
- The detective?

1014
01:11:14,951 --> 01:11:16,034
- And Julian?

1015
01:11:24,397 --> 01:11:26,420
Answer me damn it.

1016
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:27,253
Did you?

1017
01:11:38,826 --> 01:11:39,690
- You're the only one that could end

1018
01:11:39,690 --> 01:11:40,953
this curse from me, Nora.

1019
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:43,313
Do it.

1020
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:47,680
The Totec believe that during a dream

1021
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,710
the person's nagual leaves his body

1022
01:11:49,710 --> 01:11:52,140
to seek out other souls,

1023
01:11:52,140 --> 01:11:53,713
souls to whom they are linked.

1024
01:11:58,142 --> 01:11:59,475
- That's insane.

1025
01:12:13,613 --> 01:12:14,843
- I can't stop them.

1026
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,233
Do it.

1027
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:19,613
Do it!

1028
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:22,375
- Oh God.

1029
01:12:22,375 --> 01:12:23,208
I want to,

1030
01:12:25,897 --> 01:12:28,923
but it's no way I'm going
to become what you are.

1031
01:12:52,082 --> 01:12:54,338
- I killed him.

1032
01:12:54,338 --> 01:12:58,243
I killed Julian, and I let him suffer.

1033
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,797
(Nora sobbing)

1034
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,130
You're the only one that can end

1035
01:13:14,130 --> 01:13:15,713
this curse from me, Nora.

1036
01:13:16,920 --> 01:13:17,753
Do it.

1037
01:13:26,623 --> 01:13:29,540
(knocking on door)

1038
01:13:37,357 --> 01:13:38,190
- Naureen!

1039
01:13:42,280 --> 01:13:43,230
My goodness.

1040
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,353
Do I have to post visiting hours?

1041
01:13:46,361 --> 01:13:48,194
Well come on, come on.

1042
01:13:51,782 --> 01:13:52,615
There.

1043
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:00,733
Better?

1044
01:14:05,070 --> 01:14:05,903
Wanna talk?

1045
01:14:09,810 --> 01:14:11,890
You've heard from Julian, haven't you?

1046
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:12,723
How is he?

1047
01:14:15,710 --> 01:14:17,213
- He's not coming back.

1048
01:14:18,490 --> 01:14:21,040
- Your young man's not in
any trouble, is he, girl?

1049
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:25,120
If he is, maybe you
should talk to the police.

1050
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:28,240
- I tried, they didn't believe me.

1051
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:29,693
- Doesn't mean I wouldn't.

1052
01:14:36,870 --> 01:14:41,293
You know, I haven't
shared a bed for 16 years.

1053
01:14:43,060 --> 01:14:45,900
Not since Mr. Hardwick
fell face down in the yard

1054
01:14:45,900 --> 01:14:47,703
and neglected to get back up.

1055
01:14:49,110 --> 01:14:52,143
But there's half a mattress
going to waste in the bedroom.

1056
01:14:53,430 --> 01:14:55,430
It's yours for the night if you want it.

1057
01:14:58,310 --> 01:14:59,143
- Thanks.

1058
01:15:00,119 --> 01:15:01,572
I'm fine right here.

1059
01:15:01,572 --> 01:15:03,163
- Fair enough.

1060
01:15:03,163 --> 01:15:04,723
There's a blanket there.

1061
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,407
Another nip of Sherry?

1062
01:15:10,407 --> 01:15:11,240
- Mm-hmm.

1063
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:15,860
- Now typically I beat the sun up.

1064
01:15:15,860 --> 01:15:17,190
So if I'm gone when you wake,

1065
01:15:17,190 --> 01:15:19,500
you just help yourself
to the Cream of Wheat.

1066
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,970
Oh, and I'll leave the
spare door key for you

1067
01:15:22,970 --> 01:15:25,640
if I can remember where the hell

1068
01:15:25,640 --> 01:15:27,023
I hid the damn thing.

1069
01:15:28,770 --> 01:15:29,673
Here somewhere.

1070
01:15:31,456 --> 01:15:32,970
Here it is.

1071
01:15:32,970 --> 01:15:36,028
Anyway, you can stay as long as you like.

1072
01:15:36,028 --> 01:15:39,050
Might be nice to have some company!

1073
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:41,183
Do my image some good too.

1074
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,210
(chuckling)

1075
01:15:42,210 --> 01:15:46,040
The neighborhood kids think
I'm a bit spinsterly as it is.

1076
01:15:46,040 --> 01:15:47,390
Did I say spinsterly?

1077
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:49,483
Hell, they think I'm a witch!

1078
01:15:49,483 --> 01:15:51,733
(laughing)

1079
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:59,150
Well, I suppose every
neighborhood has to have one.

1080
01:15:59,150 --> 01:16:00,933
Ours did back in Iowa.

1081
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:05,281
Her name was Mrs. Chillingsly.

1082
01:16:05,281 --> 01:16:07,220
Quite a name.

1083
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:08,506
She was always--

1084
01:16:08,506 --> 01:16:12,180
(water running)
(footsteps thudding)

1085
01:16:12,180 --> 01:16:13,143
- I'm listening.

1086
01:16:18,898 --> 01:16:21,080
(door clicking)

1087
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:22,280
Is everything all right?

1088
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:38,224
Is everything all right?

1089
01:16:38,224 --> 01:16:39,412
Mrs. Hard--

1090
01:16:39,412 --> 01:16:42,995
(intense orchestral music)

1091
01:16:58,327 --> 01:17:00,087
Hello, police?

1092
01:17:00,087 --> 01:17:02,028
Yes, I want to report a murder.

1093
01:17:02,028 --> 01:17:03,111
Yes a murder.

1094
01:17:05,525 --> 01:17:06,710
Yes, I'm sure!

1095
01:17:06,710 --> 01:17:08,727
3224 Rollins Drive.

1096
01:17:08,727 --> 01:17:10,477
Please, please hurry.

1097
01:17:12,932 --> 01:17:15,765
(group murmuring)

1098
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:22,683
- [Cop] Okay.

1099
01:17:22,683 --> 01:17:25,423
C-H-A-S-E.

1100
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:28,743
- Leslie Chase.

1101
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:32,550
He lives up north, Ravenwood Road.

1102
01:17:32,550 --> 01:17:33,383
- Mm-hmm.

1103
01:17:35,040 --> 01:17:36,500
Okay I'm sorry, I just
want to go through this

1104
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,393
one more time.

1105
01:17:38,290 --> 01:17:40,380
This guy comes in
through the kitchen door,

1106
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:44,020
attacks the owner of the
property, Mrs. Hard--

1107
01:17:44,020 --> 01:17:47,530
- Mrs. Hardwick, and she
was here in the kitchen.

1108
01:17:47,530 --> 01:17:48,990
- Right.

1109
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:51,343
So he attacks Mrs.
Hardwick then he leaves.

1110
01:17:52,280 --> 01:17:54,120
You come in, you discover the body,

1111
01:17:54,120 --> 01:17:55,516
then you leave.

1112
01:17:55,516 --> 01:17:56,349
You go to the nearest phone,

1113
01:17:56,349 --> 01:17:59,390
you call it in at 23:47.

1114
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:01,300
Now according to dispatch,

1115
01:18:01,300 --> 01:18:03,653
the first unit arrives at 23:52.

1116
01:18:04,550 --> 01:18:06,180
That's five minutes later.

1117
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:08,170
They discover nothing, nada.

1118
01:18:08,170 --> 01:18:10,470
No sign of entry, no sign of a struggle,

1119
01:18:10,470 --> 01:18:12,950
and no Mrs. Hardwick.

1120
01:18:12,950 --> 01:18:14,708
- He put her in the sink.

1121
01:18:14,708 --> 01:18:15,940
- The sink?

1122
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:18,333
- In the sink so he could
wash the blood away.

1123
01:18:24,585 --> 01:18:25,418
- What?

1124
01:18:25,418 --> 01:18:27,573
- [Officer] It's Lieutenant
Fladboe, he knows Mr. Chase.

1125
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:30,243
- We're out here.

1126
01:18:31,481 --> 01:18:32,753
No, I'm with her right now.

1127
01:18:36,970 --> 01:18:37,803
All right.

1128
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:39,930
Okay.

1129
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:42,523
That explains everything, all right, fine.

1130
01:18:44,565 --> 01:18:45,552
(phone beeping)

1131
01:18:45,552 --> 01:18:47,719
(sighing)

1132
01:18:49,010 --> 01:18:50,900
Here's what we're gonna do.

1133
01:18:50,900 --> 01:18:52,070
We'll look for Hardwick.

1134
01:18:52,070 --> 01:18:54,920
In the meantime, I'll make
sure that you get home safely.

1135
01:19:00,388 --> 01:19:01,741
(police radio chattering)

1136
01:19:01,741 --> 01:19:03,908
(sighing)

1137
01:19:13,260 --> 01:19:16,010
(siren whooping)

1138
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:22,671
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1139
01:19:34,715 --> 01:19:37,382
(phone ringing)

1140
01:19:42,380 --> 01:19:43,640
- [Nora] Hi, neither Julian or I

1141
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:45,190
can come to the phone right now.

1142
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:47,540
Please leave a message
so we can call you back.

1143
01:19:49,295 --> 01:19:50,250
(machine beeping)

1144
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,063
Chase, it's me.

1145
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:55,490
I know you're in my apartment.

1146
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,813
So listen, you win.

1147
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:01,330
I won't say anything, not to the police,

1148
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:02,233
not to anyone.

1149
01:20:03,850 --> 01:20:06,000
I wish to God I could
kill you but I can't.

1150
01:20:07,580 --> 01:20:09,450
So go home, Chase, it's over.

1151
01:20:33,738 --> 01:20:36,655
(thunder crashing)

1152
01:20:42,641 --> 01:20:46,558
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1153
01:20:49,582 --> 01:20:51,999
(clattering)

1154
01:21:19,377 --> 01:21:21,794
(gun firing)

1155
01:21:24,348 --> 01:21:25,878
(gasping)

1156
01:21:25,878 --> 01:21:28,461
(gun clicking)

1157
01:21:31,074 --> 01:21:34,156
(glass shattering)

1158
01:21:34,156 --> 01:21:36,739
(Nora yelling)

1159
01:22:05,130 --> 01:22:10,130
(thunder crashing)
(breathing heavily)

1160
01:23:03,955 --> 01:23:06,872
(thunder rumbling)

1161
01:23:22,348 --> 01:23:25,098
(whooshing)

1162
01:23:25,098 --> 01:23:26,720
(grunting)

1163
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:31,720
(yelling)
(intense orchestral music)

1164
01:23:33,797 --> 01:23:36,130
(screaming)

1165
01:23:55,506 --> 01:23:58,340
(grunting)

1166
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:00,507
(panting)

1167
01:24:10,151 --> 01:24:12,401
(groaning)

1168
01:24:32,871 --> 01:24:35,121
(grunting)

1169
01:24:38,683 --> 01:24:41,600

(grunting)

1174
01:25:12,605 --> 01:25:14,938
(screaming)

1175
01:25:18,138 --> 01:25:20,471
(screaming)

1176

(gagging)

1177
01:26:00,947 --> 01:26:03,197
(grunting)

1178
01:26:05,151 --> 01:26:06,728
- Freedom!

1179
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:11,728
(thunder crashing)
(gasping)

1180
01:26:17,740 --> 01:26:20,740

(birds chirping)

1184
01:27:03,180 --> 01:27:04,930
- This oughta help you feel better.

1185
01:27:13,090 --> 01:27:15,629
(phone ringing)

1186
01:27:15,629 --> 01:27:16,879
She's not here!

1187
01:27:17,969 --> 01:27:20,770
(phone ringing)

1188
01:27:20,770 --> 01:27:22,280
You think those leeches from the tabloids

1189
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:23,680
are ever gonna quit calling?

1190
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:25,890
- Help me up.

1191
01:27:25,890 --> 01:27:26,790
- Where you going?

1192
01:27:28,440 --> 01:27:29,640
- I've gotta stop by work.

1193
01:27:29,640 --> 01:27:31,570
- Oh, Nora honey, come on.

1194
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:32,560
You don't need to do that,

1195
01:27:32,560 --> 01:27:33,840
it's only been three days.

1196
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:35,390
They can get along without you.

1197
01:27:39,720 --> 01:27:42,420
I still shudder when I think

1198
01:27:42,420 --> 01:27:44,923
about how close we both came to,

1199
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:48,490
I never suspected, Nora.

1200
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:50,720
And I heard what you were saying,

1201
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,773
but it just didn't register.

1202
01:27:54,250 --> 01:27:57,460
Hey, love may be blind,
but I am here to tell you

1203
01:27:57,460 --> 01:27:59,523
that lust is blind and deaf.

1204
01:28:00,530 --> 01:28:01,793
And dumb.

1205
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,473
Really dumb.

1206
01:28:06,210 --> 01:28:07,043
Anyway,

1207
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:12,840
I guess,

1208
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:15,193
I just haven't had the
chance to say I'm sorry.

1209
01:28:16,730 --> 01:28:18,603
I'm sorry for not believing you.

1210
01:28:19,930 --> 01:28:21,343
And to thank you.

1211
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:25,750
Because baby, I really do owe you my life.

1212
01:28:27,763 --> 01:28:31,346
(intense orchestral music)

1213
01:28:32,471 --> 01:28:33,304
- I know.

1214
01:28:37,833 --> 01:28:41,416
(intense orchestral music)

1215
01:28:43,030 --> 01:28:46,863
(mysterious orchestral music)
