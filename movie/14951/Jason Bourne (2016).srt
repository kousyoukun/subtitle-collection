Focus the satellites on these coordinates.

286
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,570
摩托车出现时即刻锁定
And give me a lock on the motorcycle when it gets there.

287
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,750
明白
Copy that.

288
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,660
我看到目标了  他们走蛇街到和谐广场
I've got the targets. They're approaching Omonia from Fidiou.

289
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,260
往西边看
Look west.

290
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:25,520
长街
The long boulevard.

291
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,390
55秒后到达你所处的位置
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

292
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,820
明白
Copy that.

293
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,400
特工上线
The Asset is online.

294
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,120
目标  特工

295
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:10,120
目标15秒后到达
Target's with you in 15 seconds.

296
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,130
5秒
Five seconds.

297
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,080
到了
Contact.

298
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:29,220
趴下
Stay low!

299
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,300
找机会开枪
Find a shot.

300
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:39,730
抓好了
Hold on!

301
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,790
目标停止活动
Targets are down.

302
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,670
伯恩在哪
Where's Bourne?

303
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,710
长官  警方直升机
Ma'am, a police helicopter

304
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,460
在楼顶特工旁边发现三具尸体
spotted three bodies on the roof near the Asset.

305
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,310
战术特警马上就到
A tactical team's on its way.

306
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,410
尼基
Nicky?

307
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,300
别动
Don't move!

308
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,960
雅典警方已进入大楼
Athens police have entered the building.

309
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,710
特工  你得马上离开
Asset, you need to get out of there.

310
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,060
不
Negative.

311
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,440
我们还不知道伯恩的生死
We don't even know if Bourne's alive.

312
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,410
你想失去他吗
You want to lose this guy?

313
00:33:16,780 --> 00:33:17,850
我是杜威局长
This is Director Dewey.

314
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:19,620
给你二十秒
You have 20 seconds.

315
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,380
坚持住  尼基
Hold on, Nicky.

316
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:29,380
我这就带你到安全的地方
I'm going to get you to cover.

317
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,800
不
No.

318
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,390
不
No.

319
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,350
不
No, don't.

320
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:47,060
我这就过去
I'm coming.

321
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,370
-找出克里斯蒂安·迪索特  -是  长官
- Get a location on Christian Dassault. - Yes, sir.

322
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,560
如果他和尼基·帕森斯合作
If he was working with Nicky Parsons,

323
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,330
就能带我们找到杰森·伯恩
he will lead us to Jason Bourne.

324
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,000
要是恶意软件有线索  就告诉我
And let me know if you get a hit on that malware.

325
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,170
长官  我想弄清楚一件事
Sir, can I clarify one thing?

326
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:57,970
说吧
Yeah.

327
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,690
特工认识伯恩吗
Does the Asset know Bourne?

328
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,250
为什么这么问
Why would you ask me that?

329
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:04,860
他在楼顶的行为
His behavior on the rooftop.

330
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,940
说明他们有联系
It suggested a connection.

331
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,110
伯恩最后一次回来时
The last time Bourne came back,

332
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:13,030
揭发了黑烟斗行动
he exposed the Blackbriar program.

333
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,330
暴露了进行中的行动
It compromised active operations.

334
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:19,540
特工当时在叙利亚卧底
The Asset was in Syria undercover.

335
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:22,540
他被捕  受折磨
He was captured, tortured,

336
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:25,380
我们花了两年时间才救出他
and it took two damn years to get him out.

337
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,530
所以你认为那是伯恩想要文件的原因
So you think that's why Bourne wants the files?

338
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,860
再曝光一次
To go public again?

339
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,610
我不知道他为什么回来
I have no idea why he came back.

340
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,610
但他肯定想毁掉我们
But whatever he's doing, he wants to destroy us.

341
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:35,800
不能让这种事发生
We can't let that happen.

342
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,100
你一有消息就给我打电话
So, you give me a call soon as you hear anything.

343
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,770
是  长官
Yes, sir.

344
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,720
已加密

345
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,720
铁手
踏脚石

346
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,720
铁手
踏脚石

347
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,720
与理查德·韦伯相关

348
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,720
杰森·伯恩受到监控

349
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,720
迪索特

350
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,720
柏林

351
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,720
科维兹广场  柏林

352
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,720
现在有请深梦的创始人和董事长
And now, the founder and chairman of Deep Dream,

353
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:42,190
亚伦·卡鲁尔
Aaron Kalloor.

354
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,020
大家都知道我为何而来
You all know why we're here.

355
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:53,900
我们要推出一款新平台
We're gonna be unveiling a new platform.

356
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,230
它是我们勇敢迈出的新一步
We think it is a bold new step

357
00:38:55,230 --> 00:38:57,550
能让我们更好地服务社会
to allow us to serve our community better.

358
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,210
我们目前的社会
We're a community right now

359
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,400
超越了国家边界
that is transcending national boundaries.

360
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:05,030
我们有十五亿用户
And I think we're 1.5 billion users.

361
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,630
简而言之  我们现在的生态系统
In a nutshell, as you know, we have an ecosystem

362
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,510
有成千上万个应用
of hundreds of thousands of apps at this point.

363
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,380
新平台的功能
And what this new platform will do

364
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:23,930
就是整合用户的数据和偏好
will be to integrate users' data and preferences,

365
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:26,100
利用这些信息
and use that information

366
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,140
来丰富并量身定制每位用户的体验
to enrich and tailor-make each unique user experience

367
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,610
这一方法前所未有
in a way that is, frankly, unprecedented.

368
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,520
我看见有些记者在奋笔疾书
Um, now, I can see some journalists' pens twitching,

369
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,940
-想提问隐私相关的问题  -对
- ready to ask about privacy. - Yeah.

370
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,360
许多人都担心这一问题  大家也应该担心
This is a concern to many people, and so it should be.

371
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,840
因为隐私对我们来说真的太重要了
I mean, this is something that matters to us.

372
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,110
我想说
And let me just say, uh,

373
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:47,100
我理解没人想被监视
I understand nobody wants to feel like they're being watched.

374
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,500
我可以这么说
So let me just tell you,

375
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,290
你来到深梦  选择了我们提供的服务
when you come to Deep Dream, when you use our service,

376
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,740
没人会监视你
no one will be watching you.

377
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:12,750
-卡鲁尔先生  -这边请  先生
- Mr. Kalloor. - Right this way, sir.

378
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,740
用餐愉快
Enjoy your meal.

379
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,970
谢谢
Thank you.

380
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:28,580
恭喜
Congratulations.

381
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,020
听说股东对新平台很满意
I hear your stockholders were very happy with that new platform.

382
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,510
听说你被入侵了
And I heard you got hacked.

383
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,750
我们正在处理
We're dealing with it.

384
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:39,980
这影响很大  太冒险了
This changes everything. There's too much risk.

385
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,610
我不干了
I'm out.

386
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,980
亚伦
Aaron,

387
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,410
你极有天赋  洞察力也强
you are an extraordinarily gifted and perceptive young man.

388
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,930
你答应帮我们的时候
When you agreed to help us,

389
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,740
是因为你知道有多大的威胁...
it was because you understood the very grave threats that...

390
00:41:00,830 --> 00:41:02,940
你知道如果这一协议被公开
Do you have any idea of the shit-storm I'll have on my hands

391
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,210
我要面临什么烂摊子吗
if this arrangement becomes public?

392
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,890
斯诺登事件对我的打击已经够大了
I already took a hit with Snowden,

393
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,760
你还想再来一次
and you want more?

394
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,720
我们的敌人变得更狡猾了
Our enemies have become much more sophisticated.

395
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:14,290
只收集大数据已经不够了
Gathering metadata is no longer adequate.

396
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:16,920
我们需要进入你平台的后门
We need a back door into your new platform,

397
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,750
一条能绕开加密程序的路
and a way past the encryptions.

398
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,190
等这些还不够  你还会想要新东西
And when that's not enough, you'll want something new.

399
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,400
你不明白  是不是
You don't get it, do you?

400
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,800
隐私就是自由
Privacy is freedom.

401
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,060
也许你该考虑考虑保护这个
Maybe that's something you should think about defending.

402
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:30,700
你个混蛋
You little prick,

403
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,390
当你公司刚起步  我们为你提供资金
you didn't believe in privacy or freedom

404
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,420
让你变成亿万富翁时
when we funded your startup,

405
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,060
你可没想着隐私和自由
turned you into a billionaire.

406
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,670
我已经加倍还给你了
I paid you back many, many, many times over.

407
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:40,170
虽然我一直很不愿意
And I was never comfortable with any of this.

408
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:41,870
我不干了
I'm out.

409
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,110
我不想再出卖用户了
I'm done selling out our customers.

410
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,920
可你却愿意出卖国家
But you would sell out your country.

411
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,990
说实话  要不是你有了危机感
The truth is, we wouldn't be having this conversation

412
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:54,240
也不会来跟我见面
if you didn't feel personally at risk.

413
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,750
你说着什么自由的因特网
You talk about a free Internet,

414
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,660
什么自己在拯救世界
you tell yourself you're saving the world,

415
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:00,600
其实你只是让世界变得更危险
but all you're doing is making it a much more dangerous place.

416
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,590
当然了  你也让保卫国家的工作
And you're sure as hell making

417
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,260
越来越艰难了
this country much more difficult to defend.

418
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,950
这些当然都要算到你头上  亚伦
And you're sure as hell accountable for that, Aaron.

419
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,950
你头上
Accountable.

420
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,950
柏林  德国

421
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,950
阿尔伯特·赫奇医生
踏脚石计划
特工行为分析

422
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,950
杰森·伯恩  行为规律评估

423
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,950
伯恩离开计划时
把代表自己身份的关键丢下了
也就是说  丢下了自己存在的理由

424
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,950
经评估  我认为伯恩在外界永远没办法安宁
总有一天会越过临界点

425
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:16,950
这时  如果手段得当  可以让伯恩重回计划

426
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,430
伯恩
Bourne?

443
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,720
长官  我在想  我们是不是弄错了
Sir, I've been thinking, maybe we've got this wrong.

444
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,890
如果他不是冲着我们呢
What if he's not coming for us?

445
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,060
如果是其他事呢
What if it's something else?

446
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:51,840
你根本不知道他是什么人
You don't have any idea who you're dealing with.

447

458
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:51,580
好的  长官
Yes, sir.

459
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:59,300
等你完事了好歹把文件留给我

这些计划都要曝光

461

我得回华盛顿

他知道美国面临着威胁

496
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:10,420
像你一样  他出于巨大的使命感

497
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,030

501
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:27,080
长官  预计还有...

跟丢了  长官

Ran all of Treadstone's surveillance in the late '90s,

510
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,980
都是他负责的
when Bourne was recruited.

511
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:25,560
他还活动吗
Is he still active?

512
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,930
改行做私人安保了
He's private security now.

513

515

我认为不应该这么做  长官
I think that could be a mistake, sir.

516
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,480
不应该  为什么
A mistake? Why?

517
00:55:37,580 --> 00:55:40,880
对伯恩  究竟是抓捕还是击毙还存在争论
There is an argument for catching Bourne instead of killing him.

518
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,930
来说说吧
All right, let's hear it.

519
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:46,910
伯恩消失了很久
Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.

520
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,520
他一直藏在阴影中  他经历过很多事
He's been hiding in the shadows, he's seen things.

521
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,960
他知道能帮助我们的信息
He knows things that could help us.

522
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:55,020
带他回来才明智
Bringing him back in is the smart move.

523
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,630
怎么带他回来呢
And how are we going to do that?

524
00:55:56,890 --> 00:55:59,830
阿尔伯特·赫奇在伯恩逃离时做了心理评估
Albert Hirsch wrote the psychal evaluation when Bourne left the program.

525
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:02,590
他认为伯恩心里依然爱国
He concluded Bourne is still a patriot at heart,

526
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:06,070
离开计划这件事会一直纠缠着他
and that leaving the program could come back to haunt him.

527
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:09,620
你有什么建议
And what are you suggesting?

528
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:12,030
我观察了伯恩看这些文件
I watched Bourne with those files.

529
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:15,250
拼命寻找过去
Desperately looking into his past.

530
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,530
我觉得他快到临界点了
And I think he's at a tipping point.

531
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:20,980
如果能面对面跟他谈
If I could get face-to-face with him,

532
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:23,010
也许可以带他回来
I think I can bring him back in.

533
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,860
一次机会
One attempt.

534
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,890
一旦失败
And if it fails,

535
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,520
你们随意处置
you do what you have to.

536
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,770
我觉得可以  你呢  鲍伯
Well, it makes sense to me. What do you think, Bob?

537
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,050
让她试试吧
Let's give it a shot.

538
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:41,150
好吧  做吧
All right, do it.

539
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:44,600
带伯恩回来  不然就处理掉
Bring Bourne in, or tie it off.

540
00:56:44,780 --> 00:56:45,800
这次必须了结掉
But this ends now.

541
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:47,020
谢谢  长官
Thank you, sir.

542
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,120
长官  抱歉...
Sir, I'm sorry...

543
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,670
没关系
No, don't worry about that.

544
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:06,010
去睡会吧  孩子
Better get some sleep, kid.

545
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:10,060
未来的24小时很漫长

546
00:57:13,050 --> 00:57:14,190
是  长官
Yes, sir.

547
00:57:28,490 --> 00:57:29,510
花的时间太久了
It's taking too long.

548
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,470
都要发布了  怎么问题还这么多
It shouldn't still be buggy this close to launch.

549
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:32,560
我觉得问题不多
Well, I don't think it's buggy.

550
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,630
我觉得我们做的改动
I think we've changed some things

551
00:57:33,630 --> 00:57:35,310
改变了一些参数
that's going to change the parameters.

552
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,640
我们得去...
We're going to have to go and...

553
00:57:36,740 --> 00:57:37,930
好了  得改回来
Okay, we need to change them back.

554
00:57:37,930 --> 00:57:39,400
阿曼达  把备忘交给凯尔

- I just don't think we want to... - I'm tired of waiting.

这是怎么回事

00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:52,120
卡鲁尔先生  我是约翰·布罗斯

- This is Dewey. - Aaron, it's a message.

570
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:26,780
趁事态还没恶化
And maybe we should think about

571
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:28,760
我们得好好审视一下了
what we're doing before it gets any worse.

572
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,160
你觉得满足了他就万事大吉了吗
So, you think if we give him what he wants, it'll end there?

573
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,180
我只是说也许我们该倾听一下
You know, I'm just saying that maybe we should listen.

574
00:58:36,470 --> 00:58:37,590
调出我跟杜威
I want you to pull up all the

575
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,640
所有的会面记录
records of all the meetings I've ever had with Dewey.

576
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,520
所有记录  私下的讨论也包括吗
All the records? Even the off-the-books discussions?

577
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,770

581
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,750
为什么派她来
Why are you sending her?

582
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,120
她有她的用处
She serves a purpose.

583
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,400
我一个人行动
I work alone.

584

01:00:26,750 --> 01:00:28,750
别搞成私人恩怨
Don't make this personal.

586
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:33,280
伯恩背叛了我们  当然是私人恩怨
Bourne betrayed us. It's always been personal.

587
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:35,470
你知道自己面对的是谁

赶快准备好

我要跟你谈谈
I need to talk.

598

谈什么
What about?

599
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,470
我已经不为中情局工作了
I don't work for the Agency anymore.

606
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:43,370
尽量收敛点
Whatever you do, stay contained.

607
01:02:43,470 --> 01:02:46,500
别惊动了英国人  问东问西的
I don't want the Brits crawling all over us, asking questions.

608
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,980

怎么回事  希瑟  B队呢
What's happening, Heather? Where's Bravo?

637
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:59,380
B队失去联络
We're comms down on Bravo.

638
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:01,580

也没有
Still nothing.

646
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,910
两支队伍都失去联络了  别搞砸  希瑟
You lost both teams? Get a grip on this operation, Heather.

647
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:34,030
这可是伯恩
That's Bourne.

648
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:35,900
让特工行动
Green-light the Asset.

649
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:38,230
长官  我需要更多时间

650
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:39,540
没时间了
We have no time.

651
01:06:40,040 --> 01:06:42,020
你下不下令
Are you going to give that order or not?

652
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,480
长官  求你了
Sir, please.

653
01:06:43,580 --> 01:06:45,490
你太天真了  看不清真相
You are too naive to see the truth.

654
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,110
根本不可能把伯恩带回来
There's no bringing in Bourne.

655
01:06:48,210 --> 01:06:49,420
必须除掉他
He has to be put down,

656
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:52,050
而你很明显没这个决断
and you obviously cannot do what has to be done.

657
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:54,350
我来接手行动指挥
I am taking operational control.

658
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,470
特工  可以行动了

659
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:00,460
重复  可以除掉伯恩

661
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,110
马上就到
I'm on my way.

662
01:07:11,190 --> 01:07:13,120
特工  你行动了吗

663
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,900
特工  你的追踪设备显示你是静止状态
Asset, your tracking device says you're stationary.

664
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:20,020
你行动了吗
Are you moving?

665
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:22,920
希瑟  别说话  让他做事
Heather, stay off this channel. Let him do his job.

666
01:07:26,630 --> 01:07:27,630

Left here.

667
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,470
-快去帕丁顿广场  -明白

01:08:24,430 --> 01:08:25,650
已锁定
Locked in.

670
01:08:44,750 --> 01:08:45,750
怎么了
What's going on?

671
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:47,090
那是什么声音
What's that noise?

672
01:08:48,370 --> 01:08:50,130
多处火警
Multiple fire alarms.

673
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:51,710
是伯恩
That's Bourne.

674
01:08:55,590 --> 01:08:56,850
我该怎么办
What do I do?

675
01:08:58,130 --> 01:09:00,060
待在那  别动
You stay there. You do not move.

676
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,520
经由最近的出口离开大楼
Leave the building by the nearest available exit.

677
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:13,280
我不能待在这里
I can't stay here.

678
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:15,010
你们保护不了我
You can't protect me.

679
01:09:15,110 --> 01:09:16,910
我需要你待在原地  史密斯
I need you to stay where you are, Smith.

680
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,620
你还能看到他吗
You still have line of sight?

681
01:09:20,910 --> 01:09:22,120
看着他呢
I'm on him.

682
01:09:22,280 --> 01:09:25,670
你们要在人群之中  他就在我身边时射杀他
You're gonna shoot him in a crowd when he's right next to me?

683
01:09:25,910 --> 01:09:27,410
待在原地  史密斯
Stay where you are, Smith.

684
01:09:27,750 --> 01:09:29,440
你知道他为什么会找来
You know why he's here.

685
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:30,700
他想要答案
He wants answers.

686
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:32,050
你已经失去控制了
You've lost this thing.

687
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,040
我得离开这里
I gotta get out of here.

688
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:42,840
操
Shit!

689
01:09:51,900 --> 01:09:53,240
怎么回事
What the hell is going on?

690
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,150
伯恩抓到史密斯了
Bourne's got Smith.

691
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,380
追上他们  我绕过去截住他们
Go after them. I'll come around and cut them off.

692
01:10:22,340 --> 01:10:23,500
史密斯  我们知道你和伯恩在一起
Smith, we know you're with Bourne.

693
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,390
你得想办法告诉我们你在哪里
You have to find a way to let us know where you are.

694
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,520
你为什么带我来这里
Why are you taking me in here?

695
01:10:30,730 --> 01:10:32,110
他们肯定在广场附近
They've got to be near the Plaza.

696
01:10:37,820 --> 01:10:39,200
天啊  伯恩
Jesus, Bourne!

697
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:41,320
混蛋
God damn it!

698
01:10:42,530 --> 01:10:44,390
你要干什么  别激动
What are you doing? Take it easy.

699
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,640
理查德·韦伯
Richard Webb.

700
01:10:45,740 --> 01:10:47,520
贝鲁特分站站长
Station Chief, Beirut.

701
01:10:47,620 --> 01:10:50,270
他是我父亲  他创立了踏脚石
He was my father. He started Treadstone.

702
01:10:50,370 --> 01:10:52,650
他让你监控我  为什么
He hired you to put me under surveillance. Why?

703
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:54,510
-老天  -他为什么找你
- Jesus! - Why did he hire you?

704
01:10:54,630 --> 01:10:56,010
什么都别说  史密斯
Don't say anything, Smith.

705
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,670
不  不
No. No.

706
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:05,930
找不到他们
There's no sign of them.

707
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,550
我们该怎么做
What do you want us to do?

708
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:09,290
沿着运河搜寻
Work your way down the canal.

709
01:11:09,390 --> 01:11:11,260
我绕过去跟你们会和
I'll circle around and meet you there.

710
01:11:15,560 --> 01:11:17,800
你跟踪我去了贝鲁特
You followed me to Beirut.

711
01:11:17,900 --> 01:11:20,140
那是我最后一次见到我父亲
The last time I saw my father!

712
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,570
他为什么要你跟踪我
Why would he have you follow me?

713
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,990
这说不通  为什么
It doesn't make any sense. Why?

714
01:11:24,200 --> 01:11:26,290
什么都别告诉他
Don't give him a goddamn thing.

715
01:11:26,870 --> 01:11:27,960
为什么
Why?

716
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,580
老天  伯恩  我要掉下去了
Jesus Christ, Bourne! I'm falling!

717
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:40,490
伯恩  别这样
Bourne, please!

718

我听到了
I can hear them!

719
01:11:42,510 --> 01:11:43,580
贝鲁特
Beirut.

720
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,890
我去是想告诉他踏脚石接触我了
I went there to tell him that Treadstone had approached me.

721
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:50,310
但如果是他创立的计划  他为什么不告诉我
But if it was his program, why didn't he say anything to me?

722
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:52,890
我做了件事
I've done something.

723
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,070
这件事
Something...

724
01:11:56,770 --> 01:11:58,140
要付出代价
...that came at a cost.

725
01:12:02,610 --> 01:12:04,190
他就是在那天被杀死的
That was the day he was killed.

726
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:06,910
官方说他是被恐怖分子杀死的
They said he was killed by terrorists.

727
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,680
但那其实不是恐怖分子  是不是
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?

728
01:12:09,780 --> 01:12:11,330
想想你家人的安全
Think about your family's safety,

729
01:12:11,330 --> 01:12:12,830
史密斯  什么都别说

730
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:15,330
下一枪我会打死你
The next bullet's in your head!

731
01:12:16,210 --> 01:12:17,590
他为什么会被杀
Why was he killed?

732
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,500
为什么
Why?

733
01:12:21,090 --> 01:12:22,930
他是因为你才被杀的
He was killed because of you.

734
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,170
你父亲  他没参与行动
Your father, he wasn't in Operations.

735
01:12:29,600 --> 01:12:31,770
他不知道我们选中了你  他发现之后
He didn't know we'd chosen you. When he found out, he...

736
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,750
威胁要把计划曝光
He threatened to expose the program.

737
01:12:34,850 --> 01:12:37,430
他不想让你变成杀手
He didn't want you turned into a killer.

738
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:46,620
谁杀了他
Who killed him?

739
01:12:55,620 --> 01:12:56,770
谁杀了他
Who killed him?

740
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:58,200
别说
Don't do it.

741
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,880
他在哪
Where is he?

742
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:03,370
他就到了
He's almost there.

743
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,680
我们要彻底解决这件事
We're gonna stop this now.

744
01:13:11,140 --> 01:13:12,480
别  求你了
No, please.

745
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,040
救命  快叫救护车
Somebody help! Call an ambulance!

746
01:13:33,120 --> 01:13:34,120
救命
Someone help!

747
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:37,080
他从楼顶摔下去了  五楼
He went off the roof. Five floors.

748
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:38,830
他认出我了
He recognized me.

749
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:41,340
我去收尾
I'm going to make sure it's finished.

750
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:48,450
马上就有人来了
Help's coming now.

751
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,760
别起来  伙计
No, don't get up, mate.

752
01:13:54,390 --> 01:13:55,850
请让开  让开

754
01:13:57,930 --> 01:13:59,690
-让我们做事  -退后

755
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:03,010
有谁看见事情经过了吗
Did anybody see what happened?

756
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:04,090
他不见了
He's gone.

757
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,090
-操  -我去找他

顺着运河找
I'll work my way down the canal.

759
01:14:09,740 --> 01:14:11,810
不  伦敦没你的事了
No. You're done in London.

760
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:13,350
你说什么
What are you talking about?

761
01:14:13,450 --> 01:14:15,040
有其他任务
There's another play to be made.

762
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:18,190
他知道我们做了什么  他会来找我们的
Now that he knows what we did, he'll come for both of us,

763
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:21,130
那也许是办成另一件事的机会
and that could be the opportunity for something else.

764
01:14:21,710 --> 01:14:22,940
这不是让你用来复仇的
This isn't about revenge.

765
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:24,210

你为什么要这么做

你我虽然出发点不同  但都是为了除掉杜威

有实际证据吗

01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:01,280
你父亲创立了这个计划
Your father created the program.

989
01:35:01,990 --> 01:35:04,680
却没那个本事完成这个计划
Didn't have what it takes to make it work.

990
01:35:04,780 --> 01:35:06,040
但你有
And you did.

991
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:08,460
你一直都有
You always did.

992
01:35:10,870 --> 01:35:12,440
所以你才会自愿报名
That's why you volunteered.

993
01:35:12,540 --> 01:35:15,540
那是因为我以为他是被我们的敌人杀死的
I volunteered because I thought our enemies killed him.

994
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:18,620
我因为一个谎言而自愿报名
I volunteered because of a lie.

995
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,530
不  你自愿报名是出于你的自我
No, you volunteered because of who you are.

996
01:35:21,630 --> 01:35:23,870
因为你就是杰森·伯恩
You volunteered because you are Jason Bourne,

997
01:35:23,970 --> 01:35:26,520
而不是大卫·韦伯
and not David Webb.

998
01:35:36,400 --> 01:35:38,070
杀了三十二个人  杰森
Thirty-two kills, Jason.

999
01:35:38,480 --> 01:35:40,220
每杀死一个人都改变了这个世界

1000
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:44,620
这个国家的国民因为你而更加安全

1001

1002
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:04,300
那你找到了吗
And how's that working out for you?

1003
01:36:12,100 --> 01:36:14,020
你永远都无法找到内心的平静
You're never going to find any peace.

1004
01:36:15,730 --> 01:36:18,940
直到你承认自己究竟是谁
Not until you admit to yourself who you really are.

1005
01:36:21,190 --> 01:36:23,030
是时候回来了  杰森
It's time to come in, Jason.

1006
01:36:24,950 --> 01:36:26,370
是时候回来了
It's time to come in.

1007
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,210
我不能
I can't.

1008
01:36:39,550 --> 01:36:40,550
至少不能为了你
Not for you.

1009
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,830
你没来过这里
You were never here.

1010
01:37:25,720 --> 01:37:26,890
你不用去找他
You don't have to go after him.

1011
01:37:30,510 --> 01:37:31,880
现在就可以结束

1012
01:37:33,100 --> 01:37:34,810
你可以做出选择

拦下他  把路口堵起来

1022

You're a traitor. You've always been a traitor.

1033

卡鲁尔先生

Aaron! What were you going to tell everyone at the convention?

1035

你在隐瞒些什么  亚伦

为什么有人会想暗杀你

深梦核心的癌症究竟是什么

1038
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:23,080
我认为在这个时候

1039
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:24,860
做出任何评论都很不合适
inappropriate to pass any comment at this stage,

1040
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,860
但我很期待和当局合作

1041
01:48:26,960 --> 01:48:28,530
查明谁敢对此事负责

1048
01:49:22,180 --> 01:49:25,920
杜威局长的做法并不明智
Director Dewey's tactics were unwise.

1049
01:49:26,020 --> 01:49:27,430
不明智
Unwise?

1050
01:49:28,270 --> 01:49:29,270
我们还在想办法

对外解释到底发生了什么

杜威的问题在于他属于过去
Dewey's problem was that he belonged in the past.

1059

你指派新的中情局局长的时候

你会希望那个人能为你服务

1065

1070

我有信心
I'm certain of it.

1073
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,440
如果你做不到呢
And if you can't?

1074
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:49,650
那就只能解决掉他了
Then he'll have to be put down.

1075
01:50:53,400 --> 01:50:55,570
这个提议很有趣
It's an interesting proposal.

1076
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,000
你可以停车了

当然  如果你认为

01:51:08,640 --> 01:51:11,370
你不需要我  那就没问题了
you don't need me, then that's not a problem.

1079
01:51:12,040 --> 01:51:15,170
有许多其他机构会想知道我掌握的东西
There are many other agencies who would want what I know.

1080

我带了东西给你

你的遭遇我很遗憾

我要怎么找你

你还是觉得你能把他招揽回来

他相信我

1097
01:53:43,990 --> 01:53:45,660
毕竟我们经历了那么多

我有信心

1100
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:52,780
如果你做不到呢

1101
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:57,710
那就只能解决掉他了
