00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,544
你甚至还没有阅读那些秘密文件的权限
You're not indoctrinated for this material.

150
00:11:36,574 --> 00:11:38,184
实际上我已经参与到这次行动中了
I'm already into it.

151
00:11:38,194 --> 00:11:40,694
,我在帕森斯下载的文件里注入了一段追踪代码
I embedded malware into Parsons' download.

152
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:44,094
如果有人打开那些文件 我能定位到他们的位置
When those files are opened, I can trace them.

153
00:11:44,494 --> 00:11:46,204
让我加入这次行动吧
Let me in.

154
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:49,884
我会找到帕森斯和那些文件的位置
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,

155
00:11:49,904 --> 00:11:53,244
如果伯恩和帕森斯在一起 我还能帮你找到伯恩
And if he's out there, I'll give you Bourne, too.

156
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:02,274
失陪一下
Excuse me.

157
00:12:08,124 --> 00:12:10,584
我很欣赏你的工作热情
I appreciate you enthusiasm.

158
00:12:10,614 --> 00:12:11,744
但是
But...

159
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:15,824
不要再把你的个人意愿强加给国家情报主管
Do not push your personal agenda to the DNI again.

160
00:12:15,854 --> 00:12:17,394
明白
Understood.

161
00:12:17,424 --> 00:12:20,324
好吧 我相信你能在这次行动中大展身手
Alright, I think you can help me.

162
00:12:20,354 --> 00:12:23,574
我会把这次行动的最高指挥权交给你
I'm going to give you full operational control on this.

163
00:12:23,584 --> 00:12:27,754
你有权限调动任何相关人员和资源去完成这次行动
And I'll assure that you have access to any relevant teams and resources.

164
00:12:27,784 --> 00:12:32,004
同时我需要知道你所做的每一步决策
And I want to know every move you make.

165
00:12:32,034 --> 00:12:33,534
明白 长官

166
00:12:33,554 --> 00:12:35,614

168
00:13:03,384 --> 00:13:05,444
我现在需要你帮忙
I need your help now.

169
00:13:06,104 --> 00:13:08,094
我这边的事还没搞定
I'm not finished here.

170
00:13:08,304 --> 00:13:10,684
杰森·伯恩现身了

171
00:13:12,604 --> 00:13:13,664
他在哪
Where?

172
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:17,264
雅典 罗马的事先解决
Athens, close your accout in Rome.

173
00:13:17,814 --> 00:13:19,344
明白

174
00:13:27,284 --> 00:13:29,314

不要 不要
No, no.

176
00:16:31,964 --> 00:16:35,524
我们刚从监控设备发现 帕森斯半小时前登上了一辆公车
We got a hit from a CCTV feed. Parsons boarded a bus half-hour ago

177
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:38,344
向雅典城西边去了 我们那边有两只小队待命
headed west across Athens. I got two local teams en route.

178
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,684
发现了伯恩的踪迹吗 目前还没有
- Any sign of Bourne? - Not so far.

179
00:16:40,694 --> 00:16:43,454
我有预感 他肯定在这起骇客事件中参了一脚
He's involved in this somehow, I can feel it.

180
00:16:45,584 --> 00:16:48,074
把所有在雅典的监控设备投到荧幕上
Upload all Athens data on feeds.

卡尔森手下的特工刚刚抵达宪法广场
Carson's bus has just arrived at Syntayma Square.

185
00:16:58,414 --> 00:17:01,264
希腊国会大厦前有不少示威人群
There's a demonstration in front of the Greek parliament building.

186
00:17:01,294 --> 00:17:02,914
我认为她想利用人群作为掩护
I think she'll use it as cover.

187
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:05,674
把A小组和B队部署到广场周围
Deploy Alpha and Bravo to the square.

188
00:17:05,704 --> 00:17:08,364
我们要在国会大厦外的人群中找到帕森斯

189
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:10,634

201
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:43,074

What's wrong?

202
00:19:43,414 --> 00:19:45,324
我帮克里斯蒂安·达索
I hacked into the Agency.

203
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:47,244
黑进了中情局的服务器

00:20:18,754 --> 00:20:21,664
我跟你说 跟达索走的太近  会害死你自己的
I told you, Christian Dassault is going to get you killed.

211
00:20:21,684 --> 00:20:23,404
杰森 我们已经无路可
We don't have a choice, Jason.

212
00:20:23,424 --> 00:20:25,904
他们现在发起了一项新的计划
It's started again. A new program.

213
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,604
代号“铁腕计划“ 相比之前之前更糟糕
Iron Hand. It's even worse than before.

214
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:29,384
那跟我有什么关系
What's that got to do with me?

215
00:20:29,414 --> 00:20:31,344
事很重要 当然跟你有关系
Because it matters. It matters.

216
00:20:31,374 --> 00:20:33,114
我觉得那不关我的事
Not too me, it doesn't.

217
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:35,134
现在最重要的事是活下去
All that matters is staying alive.

218
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:37,554
远离电子设备 你就能幸存下来
You get off the grid. Survive.

219
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:39,944
我可不认同你这个说
I don't believe that, and neither do you.

220
00:20:39,964 --> 00:20:41,494
看看你自己
Look at yourself.

221
00:20:41,894 --> 00:20:43,934
看看你现在活成什么样子
Look at what you're doing.

222
00:20:43,964 --> 00:20:46,534
你不能再这么活下去
You can't live like this for much longer.

223
00:20:48,544 --> 00:20:51,674
杰森 我来找你是因为我发现了一些事情
Jason, I came here because I found something.

224
00:20:51,954 --> 00:20:54,814
我在“绊脚石计划”的记录文件中看到了你父亲的名字
I found your father's name in the Treadstone files.

225
00:20:54,834 --> 00:20:57,204
他只不过是一个数据分析师 肯定不会参与那些行动
He was an analyst. He wasn't in operations.

226
00:20:57,234 --> 00:20:59,024
他跟那些肮脏的计划毫无关联
He wasn't near any of that stuff.

227
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:00,904
我跟你所说的这些 都是我亲眼所见
I'm telling you what I saw.

228
00:21:00,914 --> 00:21:03,174
似乎你的父亲与那项计划有着直接联系
It looked like he was involved directly.

229
00:21:03,194 --> 00:21:06,004
文件里还有很多有关你本人的资料
And there's more. More about you.

230
00:21:06,024 --> 00:21:07,314
你看到了些什么
What do you mean?

231
00:21:07,334 --> 00:21:10,694
在你加入到那个项目之前他们就在监视你了
Before you joined the program, they were watching you.

232
00:21:10,714 --> 00:21:12,504
监视我
Watching me?

233
00:21:13,244 --> 00:21:16,524
杰森 为了了解事情的真相
You've tortured yourself for a long time now, Jason.

234
00:21:16,554 --> 00:21:19,074
一直以来你都饱受煎熬
You tortured yourself for what you've done.

235
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,134
但是你对他们对你所做的一切仍然一无所知
But you don't know the truth about what they did to you.

236
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:24,684
你需要知道那些文件
You need to read those files.

237
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:32,264
快走 他们盯上你了
Move. They tracked you.

238
00:21:35,364 --> 00:21:38,764

00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,454
爬到屋顶
Get to the roof.

284
00:29:36,484 --> 00:29:38,464
伯恩会从你视野内经过
Target should pass within your line-of-sight.

285
00:29:38,474 --> 00:29:40,614
19 索罗门 收到
19 Solomon, copy.

286
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:50,714
调动卫星监视这几个坐标点
Focus the satellite on these coordinates.

287
00:29:50,734 --> 00:29:52,904
当他到达那里给我锁定摩托车位置
And give me a lock on the motorcycle when it gets there.

288
00:29:52,934 --> 00:29:54,174
收到
Copy that.

289
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:23,944
目标马上抵达和谐路
I've got the targets. They're approaching Emmanouil and Fidiou.

290
00:30:23,974 --> 00:30:27,124
他们往西去了 德朗路
- Look west. - The long boulevard.

291
00:30:27,144 --> 00:30:29,504
他们55秒后到你那边
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

292
00:30:29,524 --> 00:30:31,094
收到
Copy that.

293
00:30:55,014 --> 00:30:56,994
1号特工在线上
- The asset is online.

294
00:31:09,524 --> 00:31:12,724
目标15秒后到你那边
Targets with you in 15 seconds.

295
00:31:19,974 --> 00:31:21,924
5秒
5 seconds.

296
00:31:28,184 --> 00:31:29,244
目标已经抵达你的视野范围内
Contact.

297
00:31:29,264 --> 00:31:30,874
把头埋低
Stay low!

298
00:31:35,074 --> 00:31:37,034
找机会开火
Find a shot.

299
00:31:39,854 --> 00:31:41,524
抓紧了
Hold on!

300
00:32:18,724 --> 00:32:19,924
恩在哪
Where's Bourne?

301
00:32:19,934 --> 00:32:21,554
长官 直升机上的警察在1号特工
Ma'am, a police helicopter has spotted

302
00:32:20,564 --> 00:32:22,544
所在的屋顶上发现了三具尸体
3 bodies on the roof near the asset.

303
00:32:22,564 --> 00:32:24,684
警方马上抵达现场
A tactical team is on it's way.

304
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:34,984
妮琪
Nicky!

305
00:32:48,264 --> 00:32:49,804
别动
Don't move!

306
00:32:58,994 --> 00:33:01,194
警方战术小队已经进入建筑内
Athens police has entered the building.

307
00:33:01,224 --> 00:33:04,004
特工 你得马上撤离
Asset, you need to get out of there.

308
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:05,664
这不可能
Negative.

309
00:33:07,354 --> 00:33:09,744
我们甚至不知道伯恩的活着
We don't even know if Bourne's alive.

310
00:33:10,954 --> 00:33:13,024
你想失去这个人吗
You want to lose this guy?

311
00:33:17,944 --> 00:33:21,204
我是杜威局长 你还有20秒撤离时
This is Director Dewey, you have 20 seconds.

312
00:33:26,084 --> 00:33:27,924
妮琪 坚持住
Hold on, Nicky.

313
00:33:28,794 --> 00:33:30,764
我来救你了
I'm going to get you to cover.

314
00:33:31,894 --> 00:33:33,414
不
No.

315
00:33:38,524 --> 00:33:39,804
不
No.

316
00:33:41,584 --> 00:33:43,884
别过来..
No. Don't.

317
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:48,544
我马上过去..
I'm coming.

318
00:34:46,124 --> 00:34:48,444
给我想办法定位达索的位置 明白 长官
- Get a location on Christian Dassault. - Yes, sir.

319
00:34:48,454 --> 00:34:52,484
如果他确实和妮琪·帕森斯一起工作过
If he was working with Nikky Parsons, he will lead us to Jason Bourne.

320
00:34:52,514 --> 00:34:55,034
找到她有助于我们找到杰森·伯恩
And let me know if you get a hit on that malware.

321
00:34:55,044 --> 00:34:57,734
长官 我能问件事情吗
Sir, can I clarify one thing.

322
00:34:58,324 --> 00:34:59,774
问吧
Yeah.

323
00:34:59,794 --> 00:35:02,024
1号特工是不是认识伯恩
Does the asset know Bourne?

324
00:35:02,054 --> 00:35:04,364
你怎么突然想起问这个
Why would you ask me that?

325
00:35:04,374 --> 00:35:07,054
我看到了他在屋顶上的表现
His behavior on the roof-top.

326
00:35:07,084 --> 00:35:09,354
似乎他们两个之间有所联系
It suggested a connection.

327
00:35:10,454 --> 00:35:14,724
上次伯恩杀回来的时候 他曝光了黑蔷薇计划
The last time Bourne came back, he exposed the Black Briar program.

328
00:35:14,754 --> 00:35:17,774
许多在外行动的特工被暴露了
It compromised active operations.

329
00:35:17,804 --> 00:35:20,914
1号特工当时在叙利亚从事卧底工作
The asset was in Syria, undercover.

330
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:23,104
他被捕 饱受折磨
He was captured, tortured.

331
00:35:23,124 --> 00:35:26,764
我们花了两年才把他救出来
And it took 2 damn years to get him out.

332
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:32,144
你觉得伯恩想搞到那些文件就是为了将它们公之于众
So you think that's why Bourne wants the files to go public again?

333
00:35:32,154 --> 00:35:33,794
我可不知道他为什么突然杀了一个回马
I have no idea why he came back.

334
00:35:33,824 --> 00:35:35,914
但是有一点很清楚 他所作的一切都是为了摧毁我们
But whatever he's doing, he wants to destroy us.

335
00:35:35,944 --> 00:35:38,154
我们决不能让这种事情发生
We can't let that happen.

336
00:35:38,474 --> 00:35:42,664
所以你无论收到什么消息 马上通知我
So you give me a call, as soon as you hear anything.

337
00:35:43,564 --> 00:35:45,214
明白 长官
Yes, sir.

338
00:38:37,594 --> 00:38:43,234
现在有请深梦集团创始人兼总裁 亚伦·卡罗尔讲话
And now the founder and chairman of Deep Dream, Aaron Kalloor.

339
00:38:44,744 --> 00:38:46,214
嗨
Hi.

340
00:38:51,914 --> 00:38:55,044
各位肯定知道自己为何到场  我们将会展示一个全新的平台
You all know why you're here. We're going to be unveiling a new platform.

341
00:38:55,074 --> 00:38:59,224
我们认为这是大胆的一步 让我们能更好的为社会做出贡献
We think it is a bold new step, to allow us to serve our community better.

342
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:03,094
们的社交平台已经跨越了国与国之间的界限
We're a community right now that's trascending national boundaries, and

343
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:06,254
我们的用户量达到了15亿
I think we're at 1.5 billion users.

344
00:39:13,464 --> 00:39:16,744
各位都知道 如今在社交平台圈内
In a nutshell. As you know we have an ecosystem of

345
00:39:16,774 --> 00:39:19,694
共计有成百上千功能类似的社交应用
hundreds of thousands of apps at this point.

346
00:39:19,714 --> 00:39:23,134
深梦集团旗下社交软件的这一全新平台将会整合
And what this new platform will do will be to integrate

347
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:25,384
用户的数据和个人偏
user's data and preferences,

348
00:39:25,414 --> 00:39:29,304
我们将利用这些信息 去为每一位用户
and use that information, to enrich and tailor-make

349
00:39:29,334 --> 00:39:33,974
量身定制 从而满足每一位用户独特的需求 这样的方式
each unique user experience, in a way that is frankly, unprecedented.

350
00:39:33,994 --> 00:39:38,594
现在我能看到有一些记者举起了手上的笔 应该是要提关于个人隐私的问题吧
Now, I can see some journalists' pens twitching and ready to ask about privacy.

351
00:39:38,614 --> 00:39:39,464
是的 是的
- Yeah. - Yeah.

352
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:41,634
很多人都关心这个问题 这是毋庸置疑的
Uh. This is a concern of many people, and so it should be.

353
00:39:41,664 --> 00:39:44,944
我们也很关心这一点 我想说的是
This is something that matters to us, and let me just say

354
00:39:45,144 --> 00:39:48,354
我很能理解大家的想法 没人喜欢自己被监视的感觉
I understand nobody wants to feel like they're being watched

355
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:52,344
可以在这里郑重承诺 使用深梦集团旗下的社交应用及服务
So let just tell you, when you come to Deep Dream, when you use our service.

356
00:39:52,374 --> 00:39:54,604
没有人会背监视
No one will be watching you.

357
00:40:10,924 --> 00:40:13,344
卡罗尔 先生 这边请
Mr. Kalloor. Right this way, sir.

358
00:40:23,584 --> 00:40:24,894
请慢用
Enjoy your meal?

359
00:40:24,924 --> 00:40:26,414
谢谢你
Thank you.

360
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:29,524
恭喜啊
Congratulations.

361
00:40:29,534 --> 00:40:32,484
听说你的股东们对你的新平台十分满意
I hear you stock-holders were very happy with the new platform.

362
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,754
我却听说 你们服务器被黑了
And I heard you got hacked.

363
00:40:35,944 --> 00:40:37,684
我们能摆平的
We're dealing with it.

364
00:40:37,704 --> 00:40:41,324
这件事彻底改变了我的想法 这么做风险太大
This changes everything. There's too much risk.

365
00:40:41,734 --> 00:40:42,884
我不干了
I'm out.

366
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:44,274
艾伦
Aaron.

367
00:40:45,434 --> 00:40:48,874
你是个才华横溢 很有洞察力的年轻人
You are an extraordinary gifted and perceptive young man.

368
00:40:48,884 --> 00:40:54,754
先你同意与我们合作 因为你明白我们的国家正面临着重重威胁
When you agreed to help us it was because you understood the very grave threats...

369
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:04,244
你知不知道如果我们之前的安排公之于众
Do you have any idea the shit-storm I'll have on my hands

370
00:41:04,264 --> 00:41:06,844
将会掀起一波多大的舆论风暴
if this arrangement becomes public?

371
00:41:07,304 --> 00:41:10,154
史诺登那次泄密差点把我也拉下 而你却执迷不悟
I've already took a hit with Snowden, and you want more?

372
00:41:10,174 --> 00:41:13,124
我们的敌人已经变的越来越狡猾了
Our enemies have become much more sophisticated.

373
00:41:13,154 --> 00:41:15,394
仅仅大量收集外部数据是不够的
Gathering meta-data is no longer adequate.

374
00:41:15,424 --> 00:41:18,154
我们需要在你的新平台上开一道后门
We need a backdoor into your new platform,

375
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:19,494
从而绕过信息加密
and a way past the encryptions.

376
00:41:19,514 --> 00:41:22,864
以后这也无法满足你 也永远都不会满足
And when that's not enough, you'll want something new.

377
00:41:23,434 --> 00:41:25,794
你是不是还不明白我的想法
You don't get it, do you?

378
00:41:26,114 --> 00:41:28,844
隐私权 就像自由一样重要
Privacy is... is freedom.

379
00:41:29,044 --> 00:41:31,154
我还以为你们会扞卫公民的隐私权
Oh I mean, that's something you should think about defending.

380
00:41:31,164 --> 00:41:33,504
你这混蛋 当初我们赞助你成为一个亿万富翁的时候
You little prick, you didn't believe in privacy or freedom

381
00:41:33,534 --> 00:41:36,064
怎么没听你嘴里叨叨这些所谓的隐私和自由
when we funded your start up that turned you into a billionaire.

382
00:41:36,074 --> 00:41:39,094
我已经成百上千倍的回报给你们了
I have paid you back many, many, many times over.

383
00:41:39,114 --> 00:41:41,694
我现在以及以后都会为之前做过的事深感不安
And I was never comfortable with any of this.

384
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:43,294
我不干了
I'm out.

385
00:41:44,644 --> 00:41:46,264
我不会继续出卖我的客户了
I'm done selling out our customers.

386
00:41:46,284 --> 00:41:48,944
你这么做就是出卖你的国家
Yet you would sell out your country.

387
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:50,704
事实上
The truth is,

388
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:53,424
你觉得你有危险
we wouldn't be having this conversation if you didn't feel

389
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:55,424
才会来找我谈话
personally at risk.

390
00:41:55,444 --> 00:41:57,294
你以为在扞卫这些所谓的互联网自由
You talk about a free internet,

391
00:41:57,304 --> 00:41:58,824
自己在拯救世界
you tell yourself you're saving the world,

392
00:41:58,854 --> 00:42:01,804
但实际上你只是把世界变得更加危险
But all you're doing is making it a much more dangerous place.

393
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:06,494
而且你这样做更难扞卫自己的国家
And you sure as hell making this country much more difficult to defend.

394
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:10,574
你将会为此付出代价的 亚伦
And you're sure as hell accountable for that, Aaron.

395
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:14,184
应该负责
Accountable.

396
00:44:35,094 --> 00:44:36,594
伯恩
Bourne?

397
00:44:36,754 --> 00:44:39,044
把口袋里的东西全部掏出来 放在桌子上
Everything on the table.

398
00:44:54,954 --> 00:44:56,624
把随身碟打开
Open it.

399
00:45:01,954 --> 00:45:03,594
当然
Sure.

400
00:45:36,944 --> 00:45:38,704
伯恩现身了
Bourne's surfaced.

401
00:45:38,724 --> 00:45:40,184
在柏林
In Berlin.

402
00:45:40,214 --> 00:45:42,334
马上派柏林分队行动
Get the Berlin team up.

403
00:45:54,414 --> 00:45:56,014
她在哪
Where is she?

404
00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:57,784
她死了
She is dead.

405
00:46:01,864 --> 00:46:04,264
她知道这么做的风险
She knew the risks.

406
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:06,124
我已经警告过她了
I warned her.

407
00:46:06,774 --> 00:46:08,824
她自己做出了选择
She made a choice.

408
00:46:08,844 --> 00:46:11,004
你纯粹就是在利用她
You exploited her.

409
00:46:28,504 --> 00:46:29,944
蓝队正在行动中
Berlin team is mobile.

410
00:46:29,964 --> 00:46:31,584
那边发现了什么
What do we have on the location?

411
00:46:31,594 --> 00:46:33,584
软件定位的地点与达索有所联系
It's an address linked to Christian Dassault.

412
00:46:33,604 --> 00:46:35,754
有收到关于伯恩的消息吗 暂时没有
- Anything on Bourne? - Nothing yet.

413
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:38,624
正在接入当地监视系统
I'm accessing CCTV now.

414
00:46:39,134 --> 00:46:41,084
长官 我有一个这样的想法
Sir, I've been thinking.

415
00:46:41,094 --> 00:46:43,354
我们是不是搞错了
Maybe we got this wrong?

416
00:46:43,864 --> 00:46:46,134
他有可能不是冲我们来的
What if he's not coming for us?

417
00:46:46,754 --> 00:46:48,874
有可能是其它人在搞什么
What if it's something else?

418
00:46:50,244 --> 00:46:52,914
你根本不知道你在对付的这位是怎样的一个人
You don't have any idea who you're dealing with.

419
00:47:04,204 --> 00:47:06,214
我们应该多合作
We should work together more.

420
00:47:06,714 --> 00:47:09,594
你曾经曝光过黑蔷薇计划
You exposed the Blackbriar program.

421
00:47:10,444 --> 00:47:12,844
们的目标不是完全一致吗
We both are after the same thing, right?

422
00:47:13,464 --> 00:47:17,644
我们都想摧毁那个控制着社会的腐朽机构
We both want to take down the corrupt institutions that control society.

423
00:47:18,514 --> 00:47:20,824
我跟你不是一路人
I'm not on your side.

424
00:47:37,474 --> 00:47:39,894
已经接入监控系统
CCTV feed is online.

425
00:47:43,094 --> 00:47:44,454
他在电脑上浏览文件
He's on a computer.

426
00:47:44,484 --> 00:47:46,654
我们得阻止他
We have to stop this.

427
00:47:46,984 --> 00:47:48,784
如果他把那些文件公之于众
If he puts those files online,

428
00:47:48,814 --> 00:47:51,334
我们的计划将会泄露 很多特工将会失去性命
operations will be compromised, and people will die.

429
00:47:51,354 --> 00:47:53,014
明白 长官
Yes, sir.

430
00:47:57,794 --> 00:48:00,524
至少你可以把这些文件都留给我
At least when you're done leave me the files.

431
00:48:01,064 --> 00:48:04,114
这些肮脏的计划必须被公之于众
These programs have to be exposed.

432
00:48:04,654 --> 00:48:06,834
人们有权了解它们
People have a right to know.

433
00:48:23,674 --> 00:48:25,734
搞到那台电脑的控制权
We need that computer.

434
00:48:30,804 --> 00:48:32,744
房间里有一台手机
There's a phone in the room.

435
00:48:32,774 --> 00:48:35,364
我能利用它删掉电脑内的文件
I can use it to delete the files.

436
00:49:00,724 --> 00:49:02,594
给他打电话 蓝队怎么还没到
- Got the phone. - Where's that team?

437
00:49:02,614 --> 00:49:03,984
长官 还有五分钟抵达现场
5 minutes out, sir.

438
00:49:04,004 --> 00:49:06,344
我们快没时间抓住他了
We're almost out of time, get to him.

439
00:49:49,394 --> 00:49:50,984
听我说 大卫
Listen to me, David...

440
00:49:51,004 --> 00:49:52,994
我做了一些事
I've done something.

441
00:49:53,254 --> 00:49:55,064
做这些事
Something...

442
00:49:56,424 --> 00:49:58,704
需要付出代价
That came at a cost.

443
00:49:59,094 --> 00:50:01,624
总有一天 你会明白为什么的
One day you'll understand why.

444
00:50:02,954 --> 00:50:05,124
我准备动身回到华盛顿去
I got to get back to Washington.

445
00:50:06,454 --> 00:50:08,234
我爱你 儿子
I love you, son.

446
00:51:00,184 --> 00:51:02,024
长官 房间里的两人打起来了
They're fighting, sir.

447
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,714
又搞定一层防火墙了
One more firewall.

448
00:51:40,304 --> 00:51:42,674
长官 文件已删除
Files deleted, sir.

449
00:51:44,224 --> 00:51:45,814
打电话给他
Call in.

450
00:52:21,424 --> 00:52:23,614
伯恩 我叫希瑟·李
Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.

451
00:52:23,994 --> 00:52:26,164
我不是这里的总负责人
I'm not in charge here.

452
00:52:26,534 --> 00:52:29,234
你出走的时候我甚至还没来这里工作
I wasn't here when you went missing.

453
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:33,554
我能看到你在电脑上浏览以前绊脚石计划的文件
I can see you're going through the old Treadstone files.

454
00:52:34,274 --> 00:52:36,664
你是在找寻你的过去吗
Were you tracing you history?

455
00:52:37,304 --> 00:52:39,724
我知道你肯定是想找点什
I know you're looking for something.

456
00:52:40,494 --> 00:52:42,694
让我来帮你吧
Let me help you find it.

457
00:52:48,764 --> 00:52:50,674
把那电话给我
Give me that phone.

458
00:52:55,154 --> 00:52:56,644
是 长官
Yes, sir.

459
00:52:59,034 --> 00:53:02,244
杰森 我是罗柏·杜威 你还记得我吗
Jason, this is Robert Dewey. Do you remember me?

460
00:53:02,964 --> 00:53:05,624
杰森 你的父亲是一位爱国者
Jason, your Dad was a patriot.

461
00:53:05,654 --> 00:53:09,594
他清楚的看到我们伟大的国家
He could see the threats that America was facing, and like you

462
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:14,754
他出于崇高的使命感 选择为我们的国家服务
he chose to serve his country out of a profound sense of duty.

463
00:53:15,224 --> 00:53:18,014
他肯定不希望看到今天的你 一步步的损害中情局的利益
He would not want to see you harm the Agency.

464
00:53:18,034 --> 00:53:20,364
你必须收手
And you have to stop this.

465
00:53:20,684 --> 00:53:23,014
你必须得马上收手
And you have to stop it now.

466
00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:29,204
长官 我们预计到达时间
Sir, we're ETA...

467
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,504
守住这里
Take point.

468
00:54:10,534 --> 00:54:11,694
上去
On it!

469
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:13,214
电梯
The elevator.

470
00:55:00,914 --> 00:55:02,724
他跑了 长官
We lost him, sir.

471
00:55:19,124 --> 00:55:21,804
马尔科姆 史密斯 承包商 总部位于伦敦
Malcom Smith, contract-only, based out of London

472
00:55:21,814 --> 00:55:25,294
在上世纪90年代我们刚把伯恩招募进来 他负责所有“绊脚石计划”项目
Ran all of Tradestone's surveillance in the late 90s, when Bourne was recruited.

473
00:55:25,324 --> 00:55:26,714
他还活着吗
Is he still active?

474
00:55:26,734 --> 00:55:28,164
他现在主营私人安保业务
He's private security now.

475
00:55:28,174 --> 00:55:31,764
通知1号特工 我要他6小时内抵达伦敦并准备好随时行动
Contact the asset and tell him I want him on the ground in London in 6 hours.

476
00:55:31,774 --> 00:55:34,224
长官 我认为这可能只是场误会
I think that could be a mistake, sir.

477
00:55:37,274 --> 00:55:38,624
误会怎么说
A mitake, why?

478
00:55:38,634 --> 00:55:42,444
以前一直有一个说法 主张抓捕伯恩 而不是直接杀了他
There's an argument for catching Bourne, instead of killing him.

479
00:55:43,404 --> 00:55:45,224
有意思 继续说
Alright, let's hear it.

480
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:47,944
伯恩已经消失很长一段时间了
Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.

481
00:55:48,004 --> 00:55:50,854
他经历过很多黑幕 肯定看到了一些事情
He's been hiding in the shadows. He's seen things.

482
00:55:50,864 --> 00:55:53,064
他肯定知道一些对我们有用的情报
He knows things that could help us.

483
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:55,874
把他重新招募进来 才是明智的选择
Bringing him back in, is the smart move.

484
00:55:55,904 --> 00:55:57,764
你打算怎么做
And how are we going to do that?

485
00:55:57,794 --> 00:56:01,044
阿尔伯特·赫希曼医生在伯恩结束项目的时候给他做了一份心理诊断
Albert Herchtz wrote a psych evaluation when Bourne left the program.

486
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:03,634
他的结论 伯恩内心里仍然是一个爱国者
He concluded Bourne is still a patriot at heart.

487
00:56:03,644 --> 00:56:07,104
离开那个项目让他的内心永远无法平和
And that leaving the program could come back to haunt him.

488
00:56:09,154 --> 00:56:10,994
你的意思是
And what are you suggesting?

489
00:56:11,014 --> 00:56:13,664
我看到伯恩浏览的那些文件
I watched Bourne with those files.

490
00:56:14,644 --> 00:56:17,374
他正拚命追寻他的过去
Desperately looking into his past and...

491
00:56:17,384 --> 00:56:19,564
我认为他的心理平衡已经到了临界点了
I think he's at a tipping point.

492
00:56:19,594 --> 00:56:22,254
如果我能跟他面对面谈
If I could get face to face with him.

493
00:56:22,434 --> 00:56:24,774
我觉得我能把他重新招募回来
I think I can bring him back in.

494
00:56:24,834 --> 00:56:26,194
就试这么一次
One attempt.

495
00:56:26,214 --> 00:56:28,224
如果我失败了
And if it fails,

496
00:56:28,534 --> 00:56:30,504
你们再杀他也不迟
you do what you have to.

497
00:56:34,204 --> 00:56:37,594
恩 我觉得这个想法可行 鲍勃 你怎么看
Well, it makes sense to me. What do you think, Bob?

498
00:56:38,994 --> 00:56:41,284
我们就试一次吧
Let's give it a shot.

499
00:56:41,304 --> 00:56:43,044
好吧 开始安排吧
Alright, do it.

500
00:56:43,074 --> 00:56:44,604
要么把伯恩招回来
Bring Bourne in.

501
00:56:44,614 --> 00:56:45,994
要么就杀了
Or tie it off.

502
00:56:46,014 --> 00:56:48,744
赶紧把这事了结了 谢谢 长官
- This ends now. - Thank you, sir.

503
00:57:00,194 --> 00:57:01,464
长官 我很抱歉
Sir, I'm sorry.

504
00:57:01,484 --> 00:57:03,744
不不不 没事
Oh, no. Don't worry about that.

505
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,404
孩子 你辛苦啦 去睡一会吧
Better get some sleep, kid.

506
00:57:08,254 --> 00:57:11,344
你都一整天没阖眼了
You got a long 24 hours ahead of you.

507
00:57:14,184 --> 00:57:15,764
是 长官
Yes, sir.

508
00:57:29,974 --> 00:57:32,654
调试过程太慢了 怎么会突然发现这么多漏洞
It's taking too long, it shouldn't still be buggy this close to launch.

509
00:57:32,674 --> 00:57:35,014
我认为那不是漏洞 我觉得稍微调整一下参数...
Well, I don't think it's buggy. I think we've changed some things

510
00:57:35,044 --> 00:57:37,754
我觉得稍微调整一下参数...就能搞定了
that's gonna change the parameters, we're going to have to go and...

511
00:57:37,774 --> 00:57:39,254
不行 万一搞不定我们还得费神把它们调整回来
Okay, then we need to change them back.

512
00:57:39,284 --> 00:57:41,794
阿曼达 能麻烦你把备忘录交给凯尔吗  好的
- Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle? - Absolutely.

513
00:57:41,824 --> 00:57:43,304
听我说 我觉得你这么做没问题
Look, I don't... I... I think you're right.

514
00:57:43,324 --> 00:57:46,064
但是我觉得我们不应该因此推迟发布会...
- I just don't think we want the... - I'm tired of this.

515
00:57:48,684 --> 00:57:50,234
卡罗尔长官
Mr. Kalloor.

516
00:57:50,264 --> 00:57:51,394
这是什么情况
What the hell is this?

517
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:53,224
卡罗尔长官 我是约翰 布朗
Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Barros.

518
00:57:53,254 --> 00:57:54,934
我来自司法部
I'm from the Department of Justice.

519
00:57:54,964 --> 00:57:57,494
我是来把这份起诉书交给你的
And I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed complaint

520
00:57:57,524 --> 00:57:59,504
来自美国政府签发的 真的 在公共场合你必须这样做吗?
- issued by the US government. - Really, you have to do this in public?

521
00:57:59,534 --> 00:58:02,804
起诉深梦集团违反谢尔曼法
against Deep Dream Corporation for violation of the Sherman Act.

522
00:58:02,824 --> 00:58:06,954
次起诉要求你保存所有高管的私人以及公司的财产记录
This complaint requires you to preserve all personal and corporate financial records.

523
00:58:06,974 --> 00:58:10,374
我们还将向联邦法院起诉深梦集团违反反托拉斯法
Pending anti-trust motions to be filed in Federal Court.

524
00:58:10,394 --> 00:58:11,954
祝你好运 长官
Good day.

525
00:58:23,064 --> 00:58:25,144
这肯定是杜威搞的鬼  亚伦
- This is Dewey. - Aaron.

526
00:58:25,164 --> 00:58:26,694
这是一个信号
It's a message.

527
00:58:26,724 --> 00:58:29,774
也许我们应该在事态恶化之前考虑好应该怎么做
And maybe we should think about what we're doing before it gets any worse.

528
00:58:29,784 --> 00:58:33,304
你是不是觉得我们给他他想要的一切 他就会收手
So, you think if we give him what he wants, it will end there.

529
00:58:33,324 --> 00:58:36,464
我只是说我们确实应该考虑一下同意他的要求
I'm just saying that maybe we should listen.

530
00:58:37,554 --> 00:58:41,194
我要你整理出所有我与杜威的会面记录
I want you to pull up all the records of all the meetings I've had with Dewey.

531
00:58:41,224 --> 00:58:42,944
所有的
All the records?

532
00:58:42,954 --> 00:58:45,574
包括那些上不了台面的秘密谈话吗
Even the off thebooks discussions?

533
00:58:45,594 --> 00:58:47,524
尤其是要把那些秘密谈话整理进来
Especially, those...

534
00:58:49,964 --> 00:58:53,034
我要去拉斯维加斯了 准备开一份保险单
I'm going to Vegas, I need an insurance policy.

535
01:00:13,644 --> 01:00:15,014
什么事
Yeah.

536
01:00:15,384 --> 01:00:16,834
你到伦敦了么
You in London?

537
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:18,294
到了
Yes.

538
01:00:18,934 --> 01:00:21,044
你为什么派她过来
Why are you sending her?

539
01:00:21,414 --> 01:00:23,744
她有她自己的任务
She serves a purpose.

540
01:00:24,224 --> 01:00:25,554
我一向独来独往
I work alone.

541
01:00:25,584 --> 01:00:27,414
这次例外
Not this time.

542
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,094
不要把任务变成你的私人恩怨
Don't make this personal.

543
01:00:30,734 --> 01:00:32,544
伯恩背叛了我们
Bourne betrayed us.

544
01:00:32,564 --> 01:00:34,444
对我来说这就是私人恩怨
It's always been personal.

545
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,074
你知道你对手的能耐
You know who you're dealing with.

546
01:00:37,094 --> 01:00:39,364
你最好做好准备随时行动
You better make sure you're ready.

547
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:49,624
什么事
Yeah?

548
01:00:49,654 --> 01:00:52,404
深梦集团那边有新动作了
There's something you should know about Deep Dream.

549
01:00:52,424 --> 01:00:54,884
但我需要一个保证
But I need an assurance...

550
01:00:55,364 --> 01:00:57,774
我需要你的支持
that I have your support.

551
01:00:59,374 --> 01:01:01,884
没有问题 你手上有什么消息
You got it. What do you have?

552
01:01:02,104 --> 01:01:03,584

594
01:05:59,014 --> 01:06:00,714
B小组通讯中断
We're comms down on Bravo.

595
01:06:00,734 --> 01:06:03,214
A小组你现在能看到目标吗
Alpha Team do you have eyes on the subject?

596
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:09,644
我们紧着随后

600
01:06:27,184 --> 01:06:29,094
A小组无人回复
Alpha Team isn't responding.

601
01:06:29,114 --> 01:06:30,454
B小组呢
Bravo?

602
01:06:30,484 --> 01:06:31,704
也无人回复
Still nothing.

603
01:06:31,734 --> 01:06:32,834
两小组人都丢了希瑟
You lost both teams?

604
01:06:32,854 --> 01:06:35,664
你控制不住局面 那可是神出鬼没的伯恩啊
Get a grip on this operation, Heather, that's Bourne.

605
01:06:35,694 --> 01:06:37,474
下令出动1号特工吧
Bring out the asset.

606
01:06:37,884 --> 01:06:39,454
长官 再给我点时间
Sir, I need more time.

607
01:06:39,474 --> 01:06:41,064
我没时间给你了
We have no time.

608
01:06:41,094 --> 01:06:43,314
你到底下不下命令
Are you going to give that order or not?

609
01:06:43,334 --> 01:06:44,654
求您了 长官
Sir, please.

610
01:06:44,684 --> 01:06:49,274
你真是太天真了 伯恩是不会回头的
If you're too naive to see the trees, there's no bringing in Bourne.

611
01:06:49,304 --> 01:06:50,934
我们必须斩草除根
He has to be put down.

612
01:06:50,954 --> 01:06:53,294
现在看来你显然已经无法果断的指挥了
And you obviously cannot do what has to be done.

613
01:06:53,314 --> 01:06:56,164
下面由我来进行行动指挥
I am taking operational control.

614
01:06:56,734 --> 01:06:58,854
1号特工 你可以开始行动了
Asset, you have a green light.

615
01:06:58,874 --> 01:07:01,744
重复一遍 动手除掉伯恩
Repeat, you have a green light on Bourne.

I'm on my way.

618
01:07:12,364 --> 01:07:14,304
1号特工 你在行动吗
Asset, are you on the move?

619
01:07:16,794 --> 01:07:19,764
1号特工 为什么你的定位装置显示你是静止的
Asset, your tracking device says you're stationary.

620
01:07:19,784 --> 01:07:21,364
你在移动中吗
Are you moving?

621
01:07:21,384 --> 01:07:24,134
希瑟关闭通话器 让他专心工作
Heather, stay off this channel, let him do his job.

622
01:07:27,984 --> 01:07:30,874
马上出发 去帕丁顿广场

01:08:25,564 --> 01:08:27,134
已锁定目标
Locked in.

626
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:47,174
什么情况
What's going on?

627
01:08:47,194 --> 01:08:49,014
那边的噪音是怎么回事
What's that noise?

628
01:08:49,544 --> 01:08:51,614
有几个火灾报警器响了
Multiple fire alarms.

629
01:08:51,634 --> 01:08:53,344
肯定是伯恩搞的鬼
That's Bourne.

630
01:08:56,754 --> 01:08:58,564
接下来我应该怎么办
What do I do?.

631
01:08:59,274 --> 01:09:01,754
你站在原地别动
You stay there and you do not move.

632
01:09:09,054 --> 01:09:12,474
请到最近的出口
Please proceed to the nearest available exit.

633
01:09:13,414 --> 01:09:14,934
我不能呆在这
I can't stay here.

634
01:09:14,954 --> 01:09:16,174
你保护不了我
You can't protect me.

635
01:09:16,194 --> 01:09:18,594
史密斯 听我说 我要你呆在原地别动
I need you to stay where you are, Smith.

636
01:09:18,624 --> 01:09:20,574
你还能看到他吗
You still have line of sight?

637
01:09:21,894 --> 01:09:23,444
我正盯着他
I'm on him.

638
01:09:23,474 --> 01:09:24,974
这边这么多人
You're going to shoot him?

639
01:09:25,004 --> 01:09:27,084
他在我身边的时候你打得中他吗
In the crowd when he is right next to me?

640
01:09:27,114 --> 01:09:28,844
史密斯 呆在原地别动
Stay where you are, Smith.

641
01:09:28,844 --> 01:09:30,544
你知道他为什么要来找我
You know why he's here.

642
01:09:30,574 --> 01:09:32,114
他就是想问个明白
He wants answers.

643
01:09:32,144 --> 01:09:33,994
他来找他失去的东西了
You've lost this thing.

644
01:09:34,064 --> 01:09:35,884
我必须得马上逃
I got to get out of here.

645
01:09:42,804 --> 01:09:44,124
卧槽
Shit!

646
01:09:53,124 --> 01:09:54,554
现在是什么情况
What the hell is going on?

647
01:09:54,574 --> 01:09:56,274
伯恩带走史密斯了
Bourne's got Smith.

648
01:10:14,994 --> 01:10:17,834
去追他们 我就在附近堵住他们的去路
Go after them. I'll come around and cut them off.

649
01:10:23,264 --> 01:10:24,594
史密斯 我知道伯恩抓住你了
Smith, I know you're with Bourne.

650
01:10:24,624 --> 01:10:27,194
你得想个办法让我们知道你在哪
You have to find a way to let us know where you are.

651
01:10:29,794 --> 01:10:31,844
你为什么带我来这
Why are you taking me in here?

652
01:10:31,864 --> 01:10:33,864
他们肯定就在广场附近
They got to be near the Plaza.

653
01:10:38,924 --> 01:10:40,714
天啊 伯恩
Jesus, Bourne.

654
01:10:40,744 --> 01:10:42,384
该死的
God damn it.

655
01:10:44,064 --> 01:10:45,554
放松
Take it easy.

656
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,864
理查·韦伯
Richard Webb.

657
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:48,704
前贝鲁特情报站站长
- Station Chief, Beirut.

658
01:10:48,724 --> 01:10:51,504
他是我的父亲 绊脚石计划的发起人
He was my father, he started Treadstone.

659
01:10:51,534 --> 01:10:54,374
他付钱给你 让你监视我 为什么
- He hired you to put me under survellaince, why? - Jesus.

660
01:10:54,404 --> 01:10:55,724
他为什么这么做
Why did he hire you?

661
01:10:55,734 --> 01:10:57,294
史密斯 什么都别告诉他
Don't say anything, Smith.

662
01:10:57,314 --> 01:10:59,664
不 不
No. No.

663
01:11:06,204 --> 01:11:07,474
还是没发现他们
There's no sign of them.

664
01:11:07,494 --> 01:11:08,814
我们现在怎么办
What do you want us to do?

665
01:11:08,844 --> 01:11:10,814
继续沿着运河方向找
Work you way down the Canal.

666
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:13,134
我开车绕周围找 在那边跟你们碰头
I'll circle around and meet you there.

667
01:11:16,654 --> 01:11:18,864
你跟着我去了贝鲁特
You followed my to Beirut.

668
01:11:18,894 --> 01:11:21,184
那是我最后一次见到我的父亲
The last time I saw my father!

669
01:11:21,214 --> 01:11:23,164
他明明能见到我 为什么还派你跟踪我
Why would he have you follow me?

670
01:11:23,194 --> 01:11:25,294
这一切都说不通 为什么
It doesn't make any sense. Why?

671
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,934
一个字也别告诉他
Don't give him a god damn thing.

672
01:11:27,964 --> 01:11:29,554
为什么
Why?

673
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,114
老天啊 伯恩 我会摔下去的
Jesus Christ, Bourne, I'm falling.

674
01:11:40,134 --> 01:11:41,694
伯恩  饶了我吧
Bourne, please!

675
01:11:41,744 --> 01:11:43,244
我能听见他们说话
I can hear them.

676
01:11:43,684 --> 01:11:44,824
贝鲁特
Beirut!

677
01:11:44,844 --> 01:11:48,324
我到那边是为了告诉他有人要我参与垫脚石计划
I went there to tell him that Treadstone had approached me.

678
01:11:48,354 --> 01:11:51,644
但是他如果自己就是绊脚石计划中的一员 为什么他什么都不告诉我
But if it was his program, why didn't he say anything to me?

679
01:11:52,444 --> 01:11:54,304
我做了一些事
I've done something.

680
01:11:54,674 --> 01:11:56,314
做这些事
Something...

681
01:11:57,804 --> 01:11:59,914
需要付出代价
that came at a cost.

682
01:12:03,664 --> 01:12:05,864
他就是那天遇害的
That was the day he was killed.

683
01:12:06,144 --> 01:12:08,534
他们说他是被恐怖分子杀死的
They said he was killed by terrorists.

684
01:12:08,594 --> 01:12:11,114
杀手根本不是恐怖分子 对不对
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?

685
01:12:11,134 --> 01:12:14,684
史密斯 想想你家人的生命安全 把嘴巴闭紧点
Think about your family's safety, Smith, and keep your mouth shut.

686
01:12:14,714 --> 01:12:16,864
再不说话我就一枪崩了你
The next bullet is in your head!

687
01:12:17,244 --> 01:12:19,094
为什么他们要派人杀我父亲
Why was he killed?

688
01:12:19,874 --> 01:12:21,254
为什么
Why?

689
01:12:22,284 --> 01:12:24,644
他是因为你才被杀的
He was killed because of you.

690
01:12:27,504 --> 01:12:30,594
你的父亲 他没有参与到那个计划中
Your father, he wasn't in operations.

691
01:12:30,614 --> 01:12:33,484
他之前不知道你被选中了 后来他发现了这件事
He didn't know we've chosen you. When he found out, he...

692
01:12:33,804 --> 01:12:35,954
他威胁说要曝光整个项目
He threatened to expose the program.

693
01:12:35,974 --> 01:12:38,844
他不想你变成一个杀人机
He didn't want you turned into a killer.

694
01:12:46,474 --> 01:12:48,014
是谁杀了他

695
01:12:56,814 --> 01:12:57,964
是谁杀了他
Who killed him?

696
01:12:57,994 --> 01:12:59,634
别告诉他
Don't do it.

697
01:13:00,284 --> 01:13:01,994
他在哪
Where is he?

698
01:13:03,254 --> 01:13:05,314
他马上就到
He's almost there.

699
01:13:08,614 --> 01:13:11,104
我们马上就能救你出来
We're going to stop this now.

700
01:13:12,824 --> 01:13:14,224
求求你

701
01:13:31,024 --> 01:13:33,454
上帝 快叫叫救护车

有人需要帮忙 发生了什么

他从五楼楼顶摔下去了

我要去确保他已经死透了
I'm going to make sure it's finished.

706
01:13:47,744 --> 01:13:49,314
警察已经在路上了

大家散开 散开
Step aside, please. Step aside.

708
01:14:04,484 --> 01:14:06,044
他逃走了  妈的
- He's gone. - Oh, shit.

709
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:07,524
我去追他
I'm going after him.

710
01:14:07,544 --> 01:14:09,624
我沿运河方向继续找他

我这边还有一件事要你去办
There's another play to be made.

714
01:14:16,814 --> 01:14:19,314
现在我们以前做过的那些事伯恩都知道
Now that he knows what we did, he'll come for both of us.

715
01:14:19,334 --> 01:14:22,654
我们把握好机会 守株待兔即可
And that could be the opportunity for something else.

716
01:14:22,724 --> 01:14:24,544
你的任务和复仇无
This isn't about revenge.

717

当然有关
Yes, it is.

718
01:14:25,934 --> 01:14:28,784
不是他死 就是我亡
And it won't be done till one of us is dead.

734
01:15:29,254 --> 01:15:32,434
杜威需要卡罗尔跟他合作才能实施该项计

735
01:15:34,984 --> 01:15:36,594

你为什么帮我

跟你出发点不同 但是我们都想除掉杜威

长官

742
01:16:37,294 --> 01:16:40,194
我们会把卡罗尔之死嫁祸给一个虚构的伊拉克杀手

这个行动无需告知罗素(国家情报主管)
Russell doesn't need to know about this.

748
01:16:58,604 --> 01:17:00,524

01:17:06,154 --> 01:17:08,644
他肯定会来追杀我的

752
01:17:10,944 --> 01:17:13,164
就算他真的来了我们也能搞定他

794
01:23:53,844 --> 01:23:55,494
但不知道怎么开口 我觉得

At least you can now see that you never had a chance.

799
01:24:07,214 --> 01:24:08,924

813
01:25:13,784 --> 01:25:16,754
是不是在那里挺难保持自己的个人原则
It's tough to stick to all your principles over there?

814
01:25:17,174 --> 01:25:19,954
我一直恪守我的原则 谢谢您的关心
My principles are just fine, thanks.

看起来杜威局长暂时有点事不能上台
It appears Director Dewey is held up momentarily,

841
01:28:01,944 --> 01:28:05,634
他告诉我说他马上就来
and I'm being told that it shouldn't be too much longer.

842
01:28:05,654 --> 01:28:08,944
但我们今晚需要讨论的问题太多了 所以我们就先不等他了
But we have a ton of stuff to get into tonight, so we can start anyway.

843
01:28:08,944 --> 01:28:10,734
克雷格 能让我说几句吗

850
01:28:37,224 --> 01:28:39,934
杜威局长上台之前 我有些事
Before the Director comes out to join us,

851
01:28:39,964 --> 01:28:42,784
想跟各位谈谈
I just wanted to share a few words with you guys.

852
01:28:42,814 --> 01:28:45,614
很久以来 我一直就有这样的想法
A long time ago, I had this idea.

856
01:28:51,994 --> 01:28:54,094
于两小时前抵达拉斯维加斯
It landed 2 hours ago.

857
01:28:54,534 --> 01:28:56,424
他怎么通过移民局审查的
How the hell did he get through immigration?

858
01:28:56,434 --> 01:29:00,314
有人利用中情局权限让他的护照通过了安全审查
Someone issued him an Agency security clearance on his passport.

859
01:29:01,264 --> 01:29:04,294
这是一个非常流行的想法。
Well it turned out to be a pretty popular idea.

860
01:29:05,094 --> 01:29:08,244
全世界的人们都开始使用我们的应用
People from around the world started using our service.

861
01:29:19,884 --> 01:29:21,414
好 首先
Well, first off.

862
01:29:21,434 --> 01:29:24,134
这给我带来了很多意外的财富
This has all made me a lot more rich than it's probably...

863
01:29:24,164 --> 01:29:28,824
我上台以后 把卡罗尔和那个女的都杀了

我的意思是 大家都知道
What I mean to say is, you know.

866
01:29:32,164 --> 01:29:34,574
所有的成功都需要付出代价
All this success has come at a cost.

867
01:29:34,894 --> 01:29:39,524
在深梦集团内部有一颗毒瘤
There is a cancer at the heart of Deep Dream.

868
01:29:40,064 --> 01:29:43,224
有一些不可告人的秘密
A guilty secret and uh...

869
01:29:43,254 --> 01:29:44,934
现在 我想将它们公之于众
and I have to share it with all of you guys.

870
01:29:44,964 --> 01:29:46,334

现在就动手 把那两个人都干掉
Take out Kalloor and the girl right now.

872
01:29:54,074 --> 01:29:55,544
站住 好的
- Stay there. - Okay.

873
01:29:56,764 --> 01:29:59,694
为了筹建我的公司
When I was starting out, I...

874
01:30:00,054 --> 01:30:03,134
拿到了资金 跟他做了一笔交易
I took money to... start my company.

875
01:30:04,924 --> 01:30:07,954
我从一个穿着黑西装的男人那里
I made a bargain with a guy in the dark suit.

876
01:30:10,244 --> 01:30:13,174
现在 他要来找我的麻烦了
And now he's come back to take my soul.

877
01:30:21,314 --> 01:30:22,504
我看到了狙击手
I see the shooter!

878
01:30:22,534 --> 01:30:24,294
派人去抓杰森·伯恩

You took a long time to get here, Jason.

917

It all ends tonight.

920

来 我们现在就来好好谈谈
Be a lot easier to do it right away.

921
01:34:47,944 --> 01:34:49,654
你不是来复仇的
You didn't come here for revenge.

922
01:34:49,684 --> 01:34:52,594
你回来是因为你知道你是时候回归了
You came here because you know it's time to come in.

923
01:35:00,404 --> 01:35:02,944
你的父亲发起了这个项目
Your father created the program.

924
01:35:02,964 --> 01:35:05,874
但却没能让它步入正轨
Didn't have what it takes to make it work.

925
01:35:05,904 --> 01:35:07,604
但是你做到了
And you did.

926
01:35:08,074 --> 01:35:09,874
你的能力一直都非常出色
You always did.

927
01:35:12,024 --> 01:35:13,444
这也是你自己自愿加入这个项目的原因
That's why you volunteered.

928
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:16,514
我自愿加入这个项目 是我误以为那些恐怖分子杀了我的父亲
I volunteered because I thought our enemies killed him.

929
01:35:18,014 --> 01:35:19,724
我自愿加入纯粹是因为一个谎言
I volunteered because of a lie.

930
01:35:19,754 --> 01:35:22,664
不 你自愿加入是因为你了解你自己
No. You volunteered because of who you are.

931
01:35:22,694 --> 01:35:24,804
你加入是因为你是杰森·伯恩
You volunteered because you are Jason Bourne.

932
01:35:24,834 --> 01:35:28,044
而不是 大卫·韦伯
And not, David Webb.

933
01:35:37,434 --> 01:35:39,564
32次暗杀行动 杰森
32 kills, Jason.

934
01:35:39,584 --> 01:35:41,274
每一次你都完成的干脆利落
Every one of them made a difference.

935
01:35:41,294 --> 01:35:46,064
政府都因为你英勇的所作所为变得更加安全了
People all across this country are safer because of what you did.

936
01:35:57,204 --> 01:35:59,694
我都在尝试
Try to find another way.

937
01:36:03,144 --> 01:36:05,524
你觉得你内心的挣扎有用吗
And how's that working out for you?

938
01:36:13,234 --> 01:36:15,734
你的内心永远无法平和
You're never going to find any peace.

939
01:36:16,794 --> 01:36:20,624
除非你能认清你自己究竟是一个怎样的人
Not until you admit to yourself who you really are.

940
01:36:22,254 --> 01:36:24,574
杰森 是时候回来了
It's time to come in, Jason.

941
01:36:25,964 --> 01:36:27,884
是时候回到我们的行动中来了
It's time to come in.

942
01:36:33,924 --> 01:36:35,564
不
I can't.

943
01:36:40,774 --> 01:36:42,554
我绝不为你工作
Not for you.

944
01:37:17,234 --> 01:37:19,114
你从来都没到过这
You were never here.

945
01:37:26,694 --> 01:37:28,744
你可以不用再逃亡下去了
You don't have to go after him.

946
01:37:31,474 --> 01:37:33,464
你现在可以结束你的逃亡生涯
This can stop now.

947
01:37:34,134 --> 01:37:36,044
你可以选择留
You have a choice.

948

01:48:15,704 --> 01:48:18,574
亚伦 你在隐瞒什么 准备什么时候告诉我们
- What are you hiding, Aaron? - What were you going to tell everyone?

969
01:48:18,604 --> 01:48:20,534
为什么有人试图暗杀你
Why did somebody try to  assassinate you?

970
01:48:20,564 --> 01:48:23,244
艾伦  深梦集团的核心问题是什么
Aaron, what's the cancer at the heart of Deep Dream?

971
01:48:23,264 --> 01:48:25,954
眼下不方便做出任何评论
It'll be inappropriate to pass  any comment at this stage.

972
01:48:25,974 --> 01:48:29,784
我很乐意配合有关部门的调查 尽快找出杀手的身份
But, I look forward to working with the authorities to find out who is responsible.

973
01:48:29,804 --> 01:48:32,694
我现在要回深梦集团了 还有很多工作需要做
And in getting back to Deep Dream,  where we can continue our important work.

974
01:48:32,724 --> 01:48:34,144
谢谢各位
Thank you.

975
01:49:07,714 --> 01:49:09,164
长官
Sir.

976
01:49:18,754 --> 01:49:21,134
我想说很抱歉 长官
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

977
01:49:21,244 --> 01:49:23,104
对于维加斯发生的事
About Vegas.

978
01:49:23,264 --> 01:49:26,654
杜威局长的做法 很不明智
Director Dewey's tactics were unwise.

979
01:49:29,224 --> 01:49:32,514
我们还得编一个故事来解释他留下的烂摊子
We're still trying to come up with a narrative to explain what happened.

980
01:49:32,524 --> 01:49:37,024
那狗娘养的把我们所有人
That son of a bitch put a spotlight on Iron Hand.

981
01:49:37,344 --> 01:49:38,954
都推到了媒体的聚光灯下
On all of us.

982
01:49:38,984 --> 01:49:41,394
卡罗尔的事情还没曝光
Kalloor hasn't gone public yet.

983
01:49:42,834 --> 01:49:44,524
我跟亚伦很熟
I know Aaron.

984
01:49:45,184 --> 01:49:47,664
我们还能利用他
There's still moves we can make with him.

985
01:49:50,424 --> 01:49:51,904
继续说
Tell me.

986
01:49:52,214 --> 01:49:55,494
杜威已经成为过
Dewey's problem was that he belonged to the past.

987
01:49:56,684 --> 01:49:59,594
像卡罗尔这样的人将会塑造未来
People like Kalloor are shaping the future.

988
01:49:59,624 --> 01:50:01,564
我跟他一样 属于年轻一代
These are my people.

989
01:50:02,404 --> 01:50:04,524
我知道该怎么跟他打交道
I know how to deal with them.

990
01:50:07,604 --> 01:50:09,384
所以你想表达什么
And what do you want?

991
01:50:10,394 --> 01:50:12,424
你任命新的中情局局长时
When you appoint a new Agency Director

992
01:50:12,444 --> 01:50:15,744
你应该选一个能代表你的利益的人
You're going to need someone working for your interests.

993
01:50:16,574 --> 01:50:18,074
选一个
Someone...

994
01:50:18,834 --> 01:50:21,604
由你 直接任命的人
enpowered... by you.

995
01:50:24,704 --> 01:50:26,574
伯恩的事你打算怎么办
What about Bourne?

996
01:50:27,344 --> 01:50:29,704
你还想着把他招回来吗
You still think  you can bring him in?

997
01:50:32,354 --> 01:50:34,194
他信任我
I have his trust.

998
01:50:34,784 --> 01:50:36,884
在经历了这么多事情之后
After what we went through.

999
01:50:37,714 --> 01:50:39,494
我有信心劝他回来
I'll bring him in.

1000
01:50:39,524 --> 01:50:41,484
我很有信心
I'm certain of it.

1001
01:50:43,594 --> 01:50:45,244
如果他不听你的
And if you can't?

1002
01:50:46,984 --> 01:50:48,584
那么
Then...

1003
01:50:49,104 --> 01:50:51,264
我们就除掉
he'll have to be put down.

1004
01:50:54,354 --> 01:50:56,744
你的提议很有意思
That's an interesting proposal.

1005
01:51:01,504 --> 01:51:03,624
你可以把车停在这边了
You can pull over here.

1006
01:51:07,914 --> 01:51:11,234
当然 如果你觉得你不需要我为你效力了
Of course if you decide that  you don't need me, then...

1007
01:51:11,424 --> 01:51:13,104
那也没问题
That's not a problem.

1008
01:51:13,114 --> 01:51:16,404
有很多部门都需要我这样有才华的人
There are many other agencies that would want what I know.

1009
01:51:45,914 --> 01:51:47,874
我给你带了点东西
I brought you something.

1010
01:51:53,014 --> 01:51:57,574
这个是用中情局纪念墙上象征着你父亲的那颗星星铸成的一枚徽章
It's a cast from you father's star, on the Memorial Wall at Langley.

1011
01:52:07,324 --> 01:52:09,764
对以前你遭遇的我感到十分抱歉
I'm sorry for what  happened to you.

1012
01:52:12,014 --> 01:52:13,794
那些残忍对待你的人
How you were treated.

1013
01:52:13,814 --> 01:52:16,234
都已经不在了
But the people who did that are gone.

1014
01:52:16,254 --> 01:52:17,774
而且
And...

1015
01:52:17,794 --> 01:52:19,964
中情局也有了不小的变化
things are changing at the Agency.

1016
01:52:19,974 --> 01:52:21,824
你想表达什么
What is it you want?

1017
01:52:24,894 --> 01:52:27,684
我知道你一直是一个爱国者
I know you've always been a patriot.

1018
01:52:28,514 --> 01:52:32,154
这个国家发生的事情 也一直牵动着你的心
And what happens to this country, matters to you.

1019
01:52:32,944 --> 01:52:35,394
国家需要你这样的人
We need you to help protect us.

1020
01:52:36,544 --> 01:52:38,164
回来吧
Come back in.

1021
01:52:39,954 --> 01:52:41,954
我们可以一起为国效力
And we'll work together.

1022
01:52:49,634 --> 01:52:51,534
我再考虑考虑
Let me think about it.

1023
01:52:52,454 --> 01:52:54,534
我要怎么联系你
How will I find you?

1024
01:53:40,464 --> 01:53:42,594
你还想着把他招回来吗
You still think  you can bring him in?

1025
01:53:42,604 --> 01:53:44,444
他信任我
I have his trust.

1026
01:53:45,004 --> 01:53:47,084
在经历了这么多事情之后
After what we went through.

1027
01:53:47,734 --> 01:53:49,464
我有信心劝他回来
I'll bring him in.

1028
01:53:49,644 --> 01:53:51,634
我很有信心
I'm certain of it.

1029
01:53:52,054 --> 01:53:53,944
如果他不听你的呢
And if you can't?

1030
01:53:55,564 --> 01:53:57,034
那么
Then...

1031
01:53:57,064 --> 01:53:59,354
我们就除掉他
he'll have to be put down.
