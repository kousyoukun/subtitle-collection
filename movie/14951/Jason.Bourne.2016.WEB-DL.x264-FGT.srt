1
00:00:58,684 --> 00:01:00,235
I remember.

2
00:01:01,353 --> 00:01:03,364
I remember everything.

3
00:01:06,984 --> 00:01:10,067
Captain Webb. Good morning.

4
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:12,995
Has everything been
explained to you?

5
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,450
Yes, sir.

6
00:01:16,827 --> 00:01:20,658
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

7
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,005
I'll be whoever you
need me to be, sir.

8
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:29,380
You knew exactly what it meant
for you if you chose to stay.

9
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,639
You can't outrun
what you did, Jason.

10
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,931
You made yourself
into who you are.

11
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,596
Eventually you're gonna have
to face the fact.

12
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,807
You volunteered.

13
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,852
Christian Dassault
made a reservation.

14
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,281
Heather Lee.

15
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:41,472
Ma'am, we have a device

16
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,553
issued to a stay-behind team
in Novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993.

17
00:05:44,928 --> 00:05:47,259
Marked on our
inventory as destroyed.

18
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:49,927
It's knocking on our front door.

19
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,290
What's the status?

20
00:06:18,462 --> 00:06:20,513
Whoever it is, is just
sitting there idle.

21
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,758
There's no outbound
traffic, nothing.

22
00:06:28,988 --> 00:06:30,389
Move.

23
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:38,173
They've found a back door.

24
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,926
We need the reverse shell.
I'm gonna locate the source.

25
00:06:41,026 --> 00:06:42,027
I'm working on it.

26
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,097
Okay, people, we have a major
breach of our classified mainframe.

27
00:06:45,197 --> 00:06:47,238
Drop everything you're doing,
get on it right now!

28
00:07:13,851 --> 00:07:15,586
Ma'am, I'm sending
you the shell.

29
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:17,796
Got it.

30
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,423
- Need it right now?
- Yeah.

31
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:20,924
- Getting IP.
- Where's that traceroute?

32
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:22,655
Unknown user. Monitoring.

33
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,496
Reykjavik.

34
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,475
SecOps hacking camp.

35
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:30,768
Kill the power to the building.

36
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,394
Get into that power grid now.

37
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:33,545
Yes, sir.

38
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,257
- I've got the power to the building.
- Stand by.

39
00:07:48,177 --> 00:07:51,013
- Ten seconds.
- Let's get on top of this.

40
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:56,062
- Shut it down.
- Copy that. Shutting it down.

41
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:36,558
Dewey.

42
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:38,938
We've just been hacked.

43
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:40,504
How badly?

44
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,235
Could be worse than Snowden.

45
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,441
Is there any attribution?

46
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:45,634
We're working on it.

47
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:48,887
Lee says it must be someone with
a deep knowledge of our systems.

48
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,698
This could affect Deep
Dream, and Iron Hand.

49
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:57,577
I want a briefing in my
conference room in one hour.

50
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,131
Yes.

51
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:12,337
- Did you get confirmation?
- Yeah, there was a hack.

52
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,246
So are we exposed?

53
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,177
We don't know yet.
We're checking.

54
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:17,833
I want you to call Dewey.
Set up a meet in DC.

55
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,042
Aaron, we got a
lot at stake here,

56
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,483
- maybe we shouldn't rock the boat.
- Just do it.

57
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,480
Hey, George. We
ready for the launch?

58
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:36,078
Heather, you know the Director
of National Intelligence?

59
00:10:36,178 --> 00:10:38,049
Heather Lee, Cyber Ops, sir.

60
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:40,582
Have you got a name for us?

61
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:43,063
The hacker was a former
Agency operative.

62
00:10:44,019 --> 00:10:46,338
Believed to be working
with Christian Dassault,

63
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:48,819
and previously linked
to Jason Bourne.

64
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,571
Bourne?

65
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:54,155
- Jesus Christ.
- What did they get?

66
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:56,014
Black-ops files.

67
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:58,785
From Treadstone all
the way to Iron Hand.

68
00:10:59,576 --> 00:11:01,353
Iron Hand?

69
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,481
But that's not even operational
yet, for Christ's sakes.

70
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:07,332
Where is Nicky
Parsons right now?

71
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:08,986
On the move.

72
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:11,587
She left Reykjavik, traveling
through Bucharest to Athens.

73
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,631
Feels like a meet to me.

74
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,763
Well, how are you
going to handle it?

75
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,933
We cut the head off this thing.

76
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,690
Sir, I'd like to be
point on this operation.

77
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,680
You're not indoctrinated
for this material.

78
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,015
I'm already into it.

79
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:39,996
I embedded malware
into Parsons' download.

80
00:11:40,742 --> 00:11:43,373
When those files are opened,
I can trace them.

81
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,790
Let me in.

82
00:11:47,332 --> 00:11:49,693
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,

83
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:52,804
and, if he's out there,
I'll give you Bourne, too.

84
00:12:00,804 --> 00:12:01,975
Excuse me.

85
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:09,854
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

86
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:15,285
but do not push your personal
agenda to the DNI again.

87
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:17,262
Understood.

88
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:19,823
All right. I think
you can help me.

89
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:23,125
I'm going to give you full
operational control on this,

90
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:27,564
and I will make sure you have access
to any relevant teams and resources.

91
00:12:27,664 --> 00:12:31,255
And I want to know
every move you make.

92
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,711
Yes, sir.

93
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,171
Thank you very much, sir.

94
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:02,866
Yeah?

95
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,664
I need your help, now.

96
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,750
I'm not finished here.

97
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,171
Jason Bourne is in play.

98
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:14,570
- Where?
- Athens.

99
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,011
Close your account in Rome.

100
00:13:17,756 --> 00:13:19,167
Understood.

101
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:33,769
Lee got a hit from a CCTV feed.

102
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,480
Parsons boarded a bus a half-hour
ago, headed west across Athens.

103
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,148
I got two local teams en route.

104
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,609
- Any sign of Bourne?
- Not so far.

105
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:43,420
He's involved in this
somehow. I can feel it.

106
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:49,837
Upload all Athens data and feeds,
and activate real-time processing.

107
00:16:49,968 --> 00:16:50,969
Copy that.

108
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:54,307
Where are we?

109
00:16:55,224 --> 00:16:57,895
Parsons' bus has just arrived
at Syntagma Square.

110
00:16:58,352 --> 00:17:01,004
There's a demonstration in front
of the Greek parliament building.

111
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:02,445
I think she'll use it as cover.

112
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,111
Deploy Alpha and
Bravo to the square.

113
00:17:05,651 --> 00:17:08,178
Recon for Parsons
in the crowd outside parliament,

114
00:17:08,278 --> 00:17:10,239
and any possible
rendezvous points.

115
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:11,486
Copy that, sir.

116
00:17:11,657 --> 00:17:13,578
Sir, the Asset has landed.

117
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,440
Alpha Team arriving now.

118
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:48,902
Copy that.

119
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:20,959
I have the Alpha Team feeds.

120
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:22,190
Pull them up.

121
00:18:47,252 --> 00:18:50,280
Athens police are reporting tactical
teams moving on the demonstrators.

122
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:52,950
Isolate all social-media posts
from the square.

123
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,131
Yes, ma'am.

124
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,788
Rewind Alpha One's feed.

125
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:25,918
Yes, ma'am. Twenty seconds.

126
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,131
All right, Bravo
Two, Four, moving in.

127
00:19:41,265 --> 00:19:42,726
What's wrong?

128
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,484
I hacked the Agency.

129
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,004
For Christian Dassault.

130
00:19:47,104 --> 00:19:48,405
I got all the black-ops files.

131
00:19:48,564 --> 00:19:50,115
We're putting them online.

132
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,324
We need to move.

133
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,613
Stop.

134
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,032
Two seconds forward.

135
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:00,529
Blonde hair.

136
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:04,997
Enhance.

137
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,423
Find her.

138
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:18,535
Nicky Parsons sighted in Syntagma
Square. Redirect south on Stadiou.

139
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,580
I told you, Christian Dassault
is going to get you killed.

140
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,207
We don't have a choice, Jason.

141
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,638
It's started again.
A new program.

142
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,461
Iron Hand. It's even
worse than before.

143
00:20:27,561 --> 00:20:29,171
What's that got to do with me?

144
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:31,298
Because it matters. It matters.

145
00:20:31,398 --> 00:20:33,069
Not to me, it doesn't.

146
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,927
All that matters
is staying alive.

147
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:37,387
You get off the grid, survive.

148
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,765
I don't believe that
and neither do you.

149
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,836
Look at yourself.

150
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,769
Look at what you're doing.

151
00:20:43,869 --> 00:20:46,410
You can't live like
this for much longer.

152
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:51,860
Jason, I came here
because I found something.

153
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,251
I found your father's name
in the Treadstone files.

154
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:55,989
He was an analyst.

155
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,742
He wasn't in Operations. He
wasn't near any of that stuff.

156
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:02,643
I'm telling you what I saw. It
looked like he was involved directly.

157
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,498
And there's more.

158
00:21:04,598 --> 00:21:05,624
More about you.

159
00:21:05,724 --> 00:21:06,735
What do you mean?

160
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:10,520
Before you joined the program,
they were watching you.

161
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:12,557
Watching me?

162
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,401
You've tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

163
00:21:16,485 --> 00:21:19,096
You torture yourself
for what you've done.

164
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,932
But you don't know the truth
about what they did to you.

165
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:24,333
You need to read those files.

166
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:31,421
Move. They tracked you.

167
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:38,824
Alpha One has eyes on two
targets. One female, one male.

168
00:21:38,924 --> 00:21:39,924
Identify the male.

169
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:41,118
Copy that, sir.

170
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:43,469
Alpha One, we need an
ID on the male target.

171
00:21:43,887 --> 00:21:47,388
We've got to get out of here before the
police cut off this part of the city.

172
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:53,814
Head north.

173
00:21:55,232 --> 00:21:56,523
Meet me at the statue of Athena.

174
00:21:57,693 --> 00:21:59,284
I'll take them with me.

175
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,334
That's him.

176
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:09,256
Now.

177
00:22:15,085 --> 00:22:17,279
Stay with Bourne.

178
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:19,448
Clear to engage the target.

179
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:20,574
Copy.

180
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:22,935
Alpha Team, stay with the male.
You are clear to engage.

181
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,372
Come on.

182
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:26,974
Sir, Alpha Team comms are down.

183
00:23:27,074 --> 00:23:28,665
We've lost him, sir.
He's taken them out.

184
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:33,147
Find Parsons. He'll
come back to get her.

185
00:23:33,247 --> 00:23:34,314
Sir, rioting is spreading.

186
00:23:34,414 --> 00:23:37,465
The Greek government is
declaring a state of emergency.

187
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,169
Bravo Team, we are
retargeting Parsons.

188
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,897
We got her.

189
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,903
Split the team,
put her in a box.

190
00:26:07,985 --> 00:26:10,956
A suspect matching Bourne's description
has stolen a police motorcycle.

191
00:26:11,113 --> 00:26:12,598
He's coming for Parsons.

192
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:13,766
Where the hell is the Asset?

193
00:26:13,866 --> 00:26:14,947
Two minutes out, sir.

194
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:49,593
Parsons is at the
statue of Athena.

195
00:26:49,693 --> 00:26:50,694
Copy that.

196
00:27:14,927 --> 00:27:16,428
Bravo Team is down.

197
00:27:16,553 --> 00:27:18,372
Sir, the Asset is
arriving on scene.

198
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:19,706
- Pull up the dash cam.
- Copy.

199
00:27:19,806 --> 00:27:22,057
Give me the feed
and direct comms to the Asset.

200
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:31,189
Engaging targets.

201
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:50,252
I'm accessing Athens
police tactical data.

202
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:51,488
I need eyes overhead.

203
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:53,198
Bring up the satellite suite.

204
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:56,201
Sir, I'm showing a Misty
and a KH-12 satellite available.

205
00:27:56,301 --> 00:27:58,092
- Light up the 12.
- Yes, sir.

206
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:12,527
Satellite video feed is online.

207
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:17,739
Police have blocked
the road to the north.

208
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:20,286
The target will be
forced to turn left.

209
00:28:33,797 --> 00:28:35,699
Another barricade in 200 meters.

210
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:37,720
Target turning left again.

211
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:50,899
Bourne's heading for the alley.

212
00:28:51,273 --> 00:28:52,694
Left at the top of the hill.

213
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:26,599
Stairway.

214
00:29:26,683 --> 00:29:28,394
Up the hill. Heading east.

215
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:30,003
Give me a strike point.

216
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:31,588
He's found a way out.

217
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,340
Two hundred meters to your left.

218
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:38,387
19 Solomou. Get to the roof. Target
should pass within your line of sight.

219
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,158
19 Solomou. Copy.

220
00:29:48,455 --> 00:29:50,607
Focus the satellites
on these coordinates.

221
00:29:50,707 --> 00:29:52,578
And give me a lock on the
motorcycle when it gets there.

222
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:53,750
Copy that.

223
00:30:20,362 --> 00:30:22,663
I've got the targets. They're
approaching Omonia from Fidiou.

224
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:25,267
Look west.

225
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:26,528
The long boulevard.

226
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:29,396
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

227
00:30:29,496 --> 00:30:30,827
Copy that.

228
00:30:54,855 --> 00:30:56,406
The Asset is online.

229
00:31:09,494 --> 00:31:11,125
Target's with you in 15 seconds.

230
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,131
Five seconds.

231
00:31:28,013 --> 00:31:29,081
Contact.

232
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:30,222
Stay low!

233
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:36,309
Find a shot.

234
00:31:39,691 --> 00:31:40,732
Hold on!

235
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,790
Targets are down.

236
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:19,689
Where's Bourne?

237
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:22,468
Ma'am, a police helicopter spotted
three bodies on the roof near the Asset.

238
00:32:22,568 --> 00:32:24,319
A tactical team's on its way.

239
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,411
Nicky?

240
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,301
Don't move!

241
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,964
Athens police have
entered the building.

242
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:03,717
Asset, you need to
get out of there.

243
00:33:03,817 --> 00:33:05,068
Negative.

244
00:33:07,446 --> 00:33:09,447
We don't even know
if Bourne's alive.

245
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,415
You want to lose this guy?

246
00:33:17,789 --> 00:33:18,857
This is Director Dewey.

247
00:33:18,957 --> 00:33:20,628
You have 20 seconds.

248
00:33:25,964 --> 00:33:27,385
Hold on, Nicky.

249
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,388
I'm going to get you to cover.

250
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,801
No.

251
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,391
No.

252
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,357
No, don't.

253
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:48,069
I'm coming.

254
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,379
- Get a location on Christian Dassault.
- Yes, sir.

255
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:52,338
If he was working with Nicky Parsons,
he will lead us to Jason Bourne.

256
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:55,008
And let me know if you get
a hit on that malware.

257
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:57,178
Sir, can I clarify one thing?

258
00:34:57,973 --> 00:34:58,974
Yeah.

259
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,694
Does the Asset know Bourne?

260
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,254
Why would you ask me that?

261
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:05,865
His behavior on the rooftop.

262
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,941
It suggested a connection.

263
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:14,030
The last time Bourne came back,
he exposed the Blackbriar program.

264
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:17,332
It compromised
active operations.

265
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:20,542
The Asset was in
Syria undercover.

266
00:35:21,788 --> 00:35:26,384
He was captured, tortured, and it
took two damn years to get him out.

267
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,531
So you think that's why
Bourne wants the files?

268
00:35:30,631 --> 00:35:31,865
To go public again?

269
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:33,617
I have no idea why he came back.

270
00:35:33,717 --> 00:35:35,619
But whatever he's doing,
he wants to destroy us.

271
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:36,800
We can't let that happen.

272
00:35:38,514 --> 00:35:42,105
So, you give me a call
soon as you hear anything.

273
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,771
Yes, sir.

274
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,721
And now, the founder
and chairman of Deep Dream,

275
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:43,192
Aaron Kalloor.

276
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:45,409
Hi.

277
00:38:50,664 --> 00:38:51,665
Uh...

278
00:38:51,999 --> 00:38:53,025
You all know why we're here.

279
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:54,902
We're gonna be unveiling
a new platform.

280
00:38:55,002 --> 00:38:58,553
We think it is a bold new step to
allow us to serve our community better.

281
00:38:59,089 --> 00:39:02,409
We're a community right now that is
transcending national boundaries.

282
00:39:02,509 --> 00:39:06,030
And I think we're
1.5 billion users.

283
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:16,632
In a nutshell, as you know,
we have an ecosystem

284
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,510
of hundreds of thousands
of apps at this point.

285
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:21,386
And what this new
platform will do

286
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:24,932
will be to integrate users' data
and preferences,

287
00:39:25,032 --> 00:39:27,101
and use that information

288
00:39:27,201 --> 00:39:31,146
to enrich and tailor-make
each unique user experience

289
00:39:31,246 --> 00:39:33,617
in a way that is,
frankly, unprecedented.

290
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:36,527
Um, now, I can see some
journalists' pens twitching,

291
00:39:36,627 --> 00:39:38,946
- ready to ask about privacy.
- Yeah.

292
00:39:39,046 --> 00:39:41,365
This is a concern to many
people, and so it should be.

293
00:39:41,465 --> 00:39:45,119
I mean, this is something that matters
to us. And let me just say, uh,

294
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,100
I understand nobody wants to
feel like they're being watched.

295
00:39:48,263 --> 00:39:52,292
So let me just tell you, when you come
to Deep Dream, when you use our service,

296
00:39:52,392 --> 00:39:54,743
no one will be watching you.

297
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:13,758
- Mr. Kalloor.
- Right this way, sir.

298
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:24,742
Enjoy your meal.

299
00:40:24,842 --> 00:40:25,973
Thank you.

300
00:40:28,345 --> 00:40:29,580
Congratulations.

301
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,021
I hear your stockholders were
very happy with that new platform.

302
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:34,517
And I heard you got hacked.

303
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,755
We're dealing with it.

304
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,986
This changes everything.
There's too much risk.

305
00:40:41,525 --> 00:40:42,616
I'm out.

306
00:40:42,776 --> 00:40:43,987
Aaron,

307
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,411
you are an extraordinarily
gifted and perceptive young man.

308
00:40:48,532 --> 00:40:49,933
When you agreed to help us,

309
00:40:50,033 --> 00:40:54,744
it was because you understood
the very grave threats that...

310
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:03,947
Do you have any idea of the
shit-storm I'll have on my hands

311
00:41:04,047 --> 00:41:06,218
if this arrangement
becomes public?

312
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:09,760
I already took a hit with
Snowden, and you want more?

313
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:12,721
Our enemies have become
much more sophisticated.

314
00:41:12,973 --> 00:41:15,292
Gathering metadata is
no longer adequate.

315
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:19,755
We need a back door into your new
platform, and a way past the encryptions.

316
00:41:19,855 --> 00:41:22,196
And when that's not enough,
you'll want something new.

317
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:25,404
You don't get it, do you?

318
00:41:25,903 --> 00:41:28,806
Privacy is freedom.

319
00:41:28,906 --> 00:41:31,067
Maybe that's something you
should think about defending.

320
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:33,393
You little prick, you didn't
believe in privacy or freedom

321
00:41:33,493 --> 00:41:36,063
when we funded your startup,
turned you into a billionaire.

322
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:38,674
I paid you back many,
many, many times over.

323
00:41:39,082 --> 00:41:41,173
And I was never comfortable
with any of this.

324
00:41:41,668 --> 00:41:42,879
I'm out.

325
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,115
I'm done selling
out our customers.

326
00:41:46,215 --> 00:41:47,926
But you would sell
out your country.

327
00:41:49,176 --> 00:41:51,995
The truth is, we wouldn't be
having this conversation

328
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:55,249
if you didn't feel
personally at risk.

329
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:58,669
You talk about a free Internet, you
tell yourself you're saving the world,

330
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:01,600
but all you're doing is making
it a much more dangerous place.

331
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:06,260
And you're sure as hell making this
country much more difficult to defend.

332
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,951
And you're sure as hell
accountable for that, Aaron.

333
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:13,950
Accountable.

334
00:44:35,092 --> 00:44:36,433
Bourne?

335
00:44:36,593 --> 00:44:38,934
Everything on the table.

336
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:56,241
Open it.

337
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:02,946
Sure.

338
00:45:36,820 --> 00:45:39,656
Bourne has surfaced. In Berlin.

339
00:45:39,990 --> 00:45:41,241
Get the Berlin team up.

340
00:45:54,338 --> 00:45:55,589
Where is she?

341
00:45:55,923 --> 00:45:57,764
She's dead.

342
00:46:01,637 --> 00:46:02,638
She knew the risks.

343
00:46:04,264 --> 00:46:05,815
I warned her.

344
00:46:06,683 --> 00:46:08,234
She made a choice.

345
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,810
You exploited her.

346
00:46:28,372 --> 00:46:29,543
Berlin team is mobile.

347
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:31,400
What do we have on the location?

348
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:33,251
It's an address linked
to Christian Dassault.

349
00:46:33,377 --> 00:46:34,403
Anything on Bourne?

350
00:46:34,503 --> 00:46:37,674
Nothing yet. I'm
accessing CCTV now.

351
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:42,720
Sir, I've been thinking,
maybe we've got this wrong.

352
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,891
What if he's not coming for us?

353
00:46:46,723 --> 00:46:48,064
What if it's something else?

354
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:52,848
You don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

355
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:05,413
We should work together, Bourne.

356
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:08,831
You exposed the
Blackbriar program.

357
00:47:10,455 --> 00:47:13,317
We're both after the
same thing, right?

358
00:47:13,417 --> 00:47:17,248
We both want to take down the corrupt
institutions that control society.

359
00:47:18,547 --> 00:47:20,468
I'm not on your side.

360
00:47:37,524 --> 00:47:39,285
CCTV feed is online.

361
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,598
He's on a computer.

362
00:47:44,698 --> 00:47:46,892
We have to stop this.

363
00:47:46,992 --> 00:47:50,020
If he puts those files online,
operations will be compromised

364
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:51,230
and people will die.

365
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:52,581
Yes, sir.

366
00:47:57,753 --> 00:48:00,304
At least when you're done,
leave me the files.

367
00:48:01,131 --> 00:48:03,552
These programs
have to be exposed.

368
00:48:04,593 --> 00:48:06,514
People have a right to know.

369
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,824
We need that computer.

370
00:48:30,827 --> 00:48:32,288
There's a phone in the room.

371
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:34,000
I can use it to
delete the files.

372
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:02,285
- Got the phone.
- Where's that team?

373
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:03,693
Five minutes out, sir.

374
00:49:03,861 --> 00:49:05,492
We're running out
of time. Get there.

375
00:49:49,198 --> 00:49:50,659
Listen to me, David.

376
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,415
I've done something.

377
00:49:53,285 --> 00:49:54,496
Something...

378
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:58,124
...that came at a cost.

379
00:49:59,082 --> 00:50:01,253
One day you'll understand why.

380
00:50:02,961 --> 00:50:04,962
I gotta get back to Washington.

381
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:07,884
I love you, son.

382
00:51:00,143 --> 00:51:01,564
They're fighting, sir.

383
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:14,661
One more firewall.

384
00:51:40,184 --> 00:51:41,855
Files deleted, sir.

385
00:51:44,229 --> 00:51:45,900
Call in.

386
00:52:21,350 --> 00:52:23,141
Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.

387
00:52:23,852 --> 00:52:25,403
I'm not in charge here.

388
00:52:26,438 --> 00:52:28,729
I wasn't here when
you went missing.

389
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:33,451
I can see you're going through
the old Treadstone files.

390
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:35,745
Retracing your history.

391
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,702
I know you're looking
for something.

392
00:52:40,369 --> 00:52:42,750
Let me help you find it.

393
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:49,750
Give me that phone.

394
00:52:55,092 --> 00:52:56,343
Yes, sir.

395
00:52:58,887 --> 00:53:01,348
Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me?

396
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,335
Jason, your dad was a patriot.

397
00:53:05,435 --> 00:53:08,005
He could see the threats
that America was facing,

398
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:11,425
and, like you, he chose
to serve his country

399
00:53:11,525 --> 00:53:14,036
out of a profound sense of duty.

400
00:53:15,362 --> 00:53:17,863
He would not want to
see you harm the Agency.

401
00:53:18,031 --> 00:53:19,782
You have to stop this.

402
00:53:20,701 --> 00:53:22,542
And you have to stop it now.

403
00:53:27,082 --> 00:53:28,083
Sir, our ETA is...

404
00:53:52,983 --> 00:53:54,574
He's on the move. Be ready.

405
00:54:09,124 --> 00:54:10,234
Take point!

406
00:54:10,334 --> 00:54:11,360
On me!

407
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:12,841
The elevator.

408
00:55:00,968 --> 00:55:02,889
We lost him, sir.

409
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:21,764
Malcolm Smith, contract only,
based out of London.

410
00:55:21,864 --> 00:55:23,807
Ran all of Treadstone's
surveillance in the late '90s,

411
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:24,988
when Bourne was recruited.

412
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:26,560
Is he still active?

413
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:27,936
He's private security now.

414
00:55:28,036 --> 00:55:31,648
Contact the Asset and tell him I want
him on the ground in London in six hours.

415
00:55:31,748 --> 00:55:33,539
I think that could
be a mistake, sir.

416
00:55:37,254 --> 00:55:38,489
A mistake? Why?

417
00:55:38,589 --> 00:55:41,880
There is an argument for catching
Bourne instead of killing him.

418
00:55:43,260 --> 00:55:44,931
All right, let's hear it.

419
00:55:45,053 --> 00:55:47,915
Bourne's been off the
grid for a long time.

420
00:55:48,015 --> 00:55:50,526
He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.

421
00:55:50,684 --> 00:55:52,961
He knows things
that could help us.

422
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:56,022
Bringing him back in
is the smart move.

423
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,633
And how are we going to do that?

424
00:55:57,733 --> 00:56:00,744
Albert Hirsch wrote a psych evaluation
when Bourne left the program.

425
00:56:00,903 --> 00:56:03,597
He concluded Bourne
is still a patriot at heart,

426
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:07,078
and that leaving the program
could come back to haunt him.

427
00:56:08,994 --> 00:56:10,625
And what are you suggesting?

428
00:56:10,746 --> 00:56:13,037
I watched Bourne
with those files.

429
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:16,254
Desperately looking
into his past.

430
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:19,530
And I think he's
at a tipping point.

431
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:24,013
If I could get face-to-face with
him, I think I can bring him back in.

432
00:56:24,801 --> 00:56:25,869
One attempt.

433
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:27,890
And if it fails,

434
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:30,523
you do what you have to.

435
00:56:34,102 --> 00:56:36,773
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?

436
00:56:38,941 --> 00:56:41,051
Let's give it a shot.

437
00:56:41,151 --> 00:56:42,152
All right, do it.

438
00:56:43,028 --> 00:56:45,609
Bring Bourne in, or tie it off.

439
00:56:45,781 --> 00:56:46,807
But this ends now.

440
00:56:46,907 --> 00:56:48,028
Thank you, sir.

441
00:57:00,087 --> 00:57:01,128
Sir, I'm sorry...

442
00:57:01,255 --> 00:57:03,676
No, don't worry about that.

443
00:57:04,675 --> 00:57:07,016
Better get some sleep, kid.

444
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:11,064
You got a long 24
hours ahead of you.

445
00:57:14,059 --> 00:57:15,190
Yes, sir.

446
00:57:29,491 --> 00:57:32,478
It's taking too long. It shouldn't
still be buggy this close to launch.

447
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:33,578
Well, I don't think it's buggy.

448
00:57:33,662 --> 00:57:36,315
I think we've changed some things
that's going to change the parameters.

449
00:57:36,415 --> 00:57:37,649
We're going to have to go and...

450
00:57:37,749 --> 00:57:40,402
Okay, we need to change them back.
Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle?

451
00:57:40,502 --> 00:57:43,280
- Absolutely.
- Look, I think you're right,

452
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,841
- I just don't think we want to...
- I'm tired of waiting.

453
00:57:48,677 --> 00:57:49,995
Mr. Kalloor.

454
00:57:50,095 --> 00:57:51,205
What the hell is this?

455
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:53,123
Mr. Kalloor, my name
is John Burroughs.

456
00:57:53,223 --> 00:57:54,875
I'm from the
Department of Justice.

457
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:57,002
I'm hereby serving you
with the enclosed complaint...

458
00:57:57,102 --> 00:57:59,463
- Really? We have to do this in public?
- Issued by the US government

459
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:02,633
against Deep Dream Corporation
for violation of the Sherman Act.

460
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:06,845
This complaint requires you to preserve all
personal and corporate financial records

461
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:10,224
pending antitrust motions
to be filed in federal court.

462
00:58:10,324 --> 00:58:11,535
Good day.

463
00:58:23,128 --> 00:58:26,631
- This is Dewey.
- Aaron, it's a message.

464
00:58:26,757 --> 00:58:29,765
And maybe we should think about what
we're doing before it gets any worse.

465
00:58:29,885 --> 00:58:33,163
So, you think if we give him
what he wants, it'll end there?

466
00:58:33,263 --> 00:58:36,184
You know, I'm just saying
that maybe we should listen.

467
00:58:37,476 --> 00:58:40,647
I want you to pull up all the records of
all the meetings I've ever had with Dewey.

468
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,521
All the records? Even the
off-the-books discussions?

469
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,778
Especially those.

470
00:58:49,947 --> 00:58:53,118
We're going to Vegas.
I need an insurance policy.

471
01:00:13,155 --> 01:00:14,166
Yeah.

472
01:00:15,157 --> 01:00:16,642
Are you in London?

473
01:00:16,742 --> 01:00:17,953
Yes.

474
01:00:18,869 --> 01:00:20,750
Why are you sending her?

475
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:23,126
She serves a purpose.

476
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,401
I work alone.

477
01:00:25,501 --> 01:00:26,922
Not this time.

478
01:00:27,753 --> 01:00:29,754
Don't make this personal.

479
01:00:30,672 --> 01:00:34,284
Bourne betrayed us.
It's always been personal.

480
01:00:34,384 --> 01:00:36,475
You know who you're
dealing with.

481
01:00:36,970 --> 01:00:39,221
You better make
sure you're ready.

482
01:00:48,565 --> 01:00:49,565
Yeah.

483
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:52,302
There's something you should
know about Deep Dream.

484
01:00:52,402 --> 01:00:54,113
But I need an assurance

485
01:00:55,155 --> 01:00:56,906
that I have your support.

486
01:00:59,243 --> 01:01:01,334
You got it. What do you have?

487
01:01:02,037 --> 01:01:06,043
Kalloor is planning
something for Vegas.

488
01:01:51,670 --> 01:01:52,671
Yes?

489
01:01:52,838 --> 01:01:54,209
This is Jason Bourne.

490
01:01:55,007 --> 01:01:56,298
I need to talk.

491
01:01:57,509 --> 01:01:58,702
What about?

492
01:01:58,802 --> 01:02:00,473
I don't work for
the Agency anymore.

493
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:03,390
Paddington Plaza, 15 minutes.

494
01:02:32,920 --> 01:02:33,961
Bourne just called Smith.

495
01:02:34,713 --> 01:02:36,264
They're meeting at
Paddington Plaza.

496
01:02:36,423 --> 01:02:38,075
15 minutes.

497
01:02:38,175 --> 01:02:39,766
We'll tail Smith the whole way.

498
01:02:39,968 --> 01:02:42,955
As soon as we get eyes on
Bourne, I'll approach him.

499
01:02:43,055 --> 01:02:44,373
Whatever you do, stay contained.

500
01:02:44,473 --> 01:02:47,501
I don't want the Brits crawling
all over us, asking questions.

501
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:48,982
Understood.

502
01:02:57,486 --> 01:02:58,697
Tracking device.

503
01:02:59,738 --> 01:03:01,489
You'll hold on the south
side of the bridge.

504
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:04,531
I'll contact you if I need you.

505
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:06,291
Sure.

506
01:03:07,579 --> 01:03:08,580
You're the boss, right?

507
01:03:37,776 --> 01:03:40,397
Subject is on the move.
Heading toward the canal.

508
01:03:41,405 --> 01:03:43,326
Alpha Team, take
a parallel track.

509
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:45,934
Bravo Team, follow the
subject from behind.

510
01:03:46,034 --> 01:03:47,665
And keep your eyes
open for Bourne.

511
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:50,084
Bravo Team tailing subject.

512
01:03:58,922 --> 01:04:00,032
Let's go.

513
01:04:00,132 --> 01:04:01,909
In 200 meters, make a right.

514
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:03,340
Copy that.

515
01:04:09,349 --> 01:04:12,140
Comms check. Second
channel. Do you copy?

516
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:14,338
I have you. Where are you now?

517
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:15,609
Heading towards Smith.

518
01:04:17,441 --> 01:04:18,572
No sign of Bourne.

519
01:05:00,734 --> 01:05:03,303
Subject has turned
east, into an alley.

520
01:05:03,403 --> 01:05:06,909
Alpha Team, that alley leads to a
footbridge, which will bring him to you.

521
01:05:07,366 --> 01:05:08,367
Copy that.

522
01:05:20,879 --> 01:05:22,340
Bravo Team is down.

523
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:23,595
Sending you updated route now.

524
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,220
You copy that, Smith?

525
01:05:29,638 --> 01:05:30,639
Yes.

526
01:05:48,907 --> 01:05:51,908
Bravo Team, why aren't you
moving? What's going on?

527
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:55,465
Bravo Team, do you copy?

528
01:05:56,498 --> 01:05:58,329
What's happening,
Heather? Where's Bravo?

529
01:05:58,834 --> 01:06:00,385
We're comms down on Bravo.

530
01:06:00,586 --> 01:06:02,587
Alpha Team, do you have
eyes on the subject?

531
01:06:07,801 --> 01:06:08,972
We have eyes on.

532
01:06:15,559 --> 01:06:17,440
Alpha Team, sit-rep.

533
01:06:22,649 --> 01:06:24,218
Alpha Team, report.

534
01:06:24,318 --> 01:06:25,819
What's happening, Heather?

535
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,639
Alpha Team isn't responding.

536
01:06:28,739 --> 01:06:30,307
Bravo?

537
01:06:30,407 --> 01:06:31,600
Still nothing.

538
01:06:31,700 --> 01:06:33,911
You lost both teams? Get a grip
on this operation, Heather.

539
01:06:34,036 --> 01:06:35,037
That's Bourne.

540
01:06:35,495 --> 01:06:36,906
Green-light the Asset.

541
01:06:37,789 --> 01:06:39,233
Sir, I need more time.

542
01:06:39,333 --> 01:06:40,544
We have no time.

543
01:06:41,043 --> 01:06:43,028
Are you going to give
that order or not?

544
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:44,488
Sir, please.

545
01:06:44,588 --> 01:06:46,490
You are too naive
to see the truth.

546
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:49,118
There's no bringing in Bourne.

547
01:06:49,218 --> 01:06:53,050
He has to be put down, and you
obviously cannot do what has to be done.

548
01:06:53,263 --> 01:06:55,354
I am taking operational control.

549
01:06:56,725 --> 01:06:58,476
Asset, you have a green light.

550
01:06:58,644 --> 01:07:01,463
Repeat, you have a
green light on Bourne.

551
01:07:01,563 --> 01:07:02,614
Copy that.

552
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,112
I'm on my way.

553
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:14,120
Asset, are you on the move?

554
01:07:16,578 --> 01:07:18,909
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.

555
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:21,024
Are you moving?

556
01:07:21,124 --> 01:07:23,925
Heather, stay off this channel.
Let him do his job.

557
01:07:27,631 --> 01:07:28,632
Left here.

558
01:07:28,882 --> 01:07:31,473
- Get to Paddington Plaza, fast.
- Copy that.

559
01:08:14,261 --> 01:08:15,512
In position.

560
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:26,650
Locked in.

561
01:08:45,751 --> 01:08:46,752
What's going on?

562
01:08:47,002 --> 01:08:48,093
What's that noise?

563
01:08:49,379 --> 01:08:51,130
Multiple fire alarms.

564
01:08:51,298 --> 01:08:52,719
That's Bourne.

565
01:08:56,595 --> 01:08:57,856
What do I do?

566
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:01,060
You stay there. You do not move.

567
01:09:08,815 --> 01:09:11,526
Leave the building
by the nearest available exit.

568
01:09:13,195 --> 01:09:14,286
I can't stay here.

569
01:09:14,655 --> 01:09:16,014
You can't protect me.

570
01:09:16,114 --> 01:09:17,915
I need you to stay
where you are, Smith.

571
01:09:18,450 --> 01:09:19,621
You still have line of sight?

572
01:09:21,912 --> 01:09:23,123
I'm on him.

573
01:09:23,288 --> 01:09:26,674
You're gonna shoot him in a
crowd when he's right next to me?

574
01:09:26,917 --> 01:09:28,418
Stay where you are, Smith.

575
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:30,446
You know why he's here.

576
01:09:30,546 --> 01:09:31,707
He wants answers.

577
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:33,055
You've lost this thing.

578
01:09:33,966 --> 01:09:35,047
I gotta get out of here.

579
01:09:42,516 --> 01:09:43,847
Shit!

580
01:09:52,901 --> 01:09:54,242
What the hell is going on?

581
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:56,154
Bourne's got Smith.

582
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:17,383
Go after them. I'll come
around and cut them off.

583
01:10:23,348 --> 01:10:24,500
Smith, we know
you're with Bourne.

584
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,391
You have to find a way
to let us know where you are.

585
01:10:29,771 --> 01:10:31,522
Why are you taking me in here?

586
01:10:31,732 --> 01:10:33,113
They've got to be
near the Plaza.

587
01:10:38,822 --> 01:10:40,203
Jesus, Bourne!

588
01:10:40,724 --> 01:10:42,325
God damn it!

589
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:45,395
What are you doing?
Take it easy.

590
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:46,647
Richard Webb.

591
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:48,524
Station Chief, Beirut.

592
01:10:48,624 --> 01:10:51,276
He was my father. He
started Treadstone.

593
01:10:51,376 --> 01:10:53,654
He hired you to put me
under surveillance. Why?

594
01:10:53,754 --> 01:10:55,515
- Jesus!
- Why did he hire you?

595
01:10:55,631 --> 01:10:57,012
Don't say anything, Smith.

596
01:10:57,216 --> 01:10:58,677
No. No.

597
01:11:05,933 --> 01:11:06,934
There's no sign of them.

598
01:11:07,476 --> 01:11:08,557
What do you want us to do?

599
01:11:08,685 --> 01:11:10,295
Work your way down the canal.

600
01:11:10,395 --> 01:11:12,266
I'll circle around
and meet you there.

601
01:11:16,568 --> 01:11:18,804
You followed me to Beirut.

602
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:21,140
The last time I saw my father!

603
01:11:21,240 --> 01:11:22,571
Why would he have you follow me?

604
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:24,991
It doesn't make any sense. Why?

605
01:11:25,202 --> 01:11:27,293
Don't give him a goddamn thing.

606
01:11:27,871 --> 01:11:28,962
Why?

607
01:11:37,756 --> 01:11:39,587
Jesus Christ,
Bourne! I'm falling!

608
01:11:39,967 --> 01:11:41,493
Bourne, please!

609
01:11:41,593 --> 01:11:43,412
I can hear them!

610
01:11:43,512 --> 01:11:44,580
Beirut.

611
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:47,891
I went there to tell him that
Treadstone had approached me.

612
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:51,314
But if it was his program, why
didn't he say anything to me?

613
01:11:52,396 --> 01:11:53,897
I've done something.

614
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,071
Something...

615
01:11:57,776 --> 01:11:59,147
...that came at a cost.

616
01:12:03,615 --> 01:12:05,196
That was the day he was killed.

617
01:12:06,034 --> 01:12:07,915
They said he was
killed by terrorists.

618
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,689
He wasn't killed by
terrorists, was he?

619
01:12:10,789 --> 01:12:13,830
Think about your family's safety,
Smith. You keep your mouth shut.

620
01:12:14,626 --> 01:12:16,337
The next bullet's in your head!

621
01:12:17,212 --> 01:12:18,593
Why was he killed?

622
01:12:19,506 --> 01:12:20,507
Why?

623
01:12:22,092 --> 01:12:23,933
He was killed because of you.

624
01:12:27,306 --> 01:12:30,177
Your father, he
wasn't in Operations.

625
01:12:30,601 --> 01:12:32,772
He didn't know we'd chosen you.
When he found out, he...

626
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:35,756
He threatened to
expose the program.

627
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:38,437
He didn't want you
turned into a killer.

628
01:12:46,450 --> 01:12:47,621
Who killed him?

629
01:12:56,627 --> 01:12:57,778
Who killed him?

630
01:12:57,878 --> 01:12:59,209
Don't do it.

631
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:00,881
Where is he?

632
01:13:03,008 --> 01:13:04,379
He's almost there.

633
01:13:08,430 --> 01:13:10,681
We're gonna stop this now.

634
01:13:12,142 --> 01:13:13,483
No, please.

635
01:13:31,370 --> 01:13:33,041
Somebody help!
Call an ambulance!

636
01:13:34,122 --> 01:13:35,123
Someone help!

637
01:13:36,083 --> 01:13:38,084
He went off the
roof. Five floors.

638
01:13:38,335 --> 01:13:39,836
He recognized me.

639
01:13:40,254 --> 01:13:42,345
I'm going to make
sure it's finished.

640
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:49,455
Help's coming now.

641
01:13:49,555 --> 01:13:50,766
No, don't get up, mate.

642
01:13:55,394 --> 01:13:56,855
Step aside, please. Step aside.

643
01:13:57,521 --> 01:13:58,839
Everybody step back.

644
01:13:58,939 --> 01:14:00,690
- Let us do our job.
- Please step back.

645
01:14:02,901 --> 01:14:04,011
Did anybody see what happened?

646
01:14:04,111 --> 01:14:05,111
He's gone.

647
01:14:05,195 --> 01:14:07,097
- Oh, shit.
- I'm going after him.

648
01:14:07,197 --> 01:14:08,818
I'll work my way down the canal.

649
01:14:10,742 --> 01:14:12,811
No. You're done in London.

650
01:14:12,911 --> 01:14:14,354
What are you talking about?

651
01:14:14,454 --> 01:14:16,045
There's another play to be made.

652
01:14:16,707 --> 01:14:19,193
Now that he knows what we did,
he'll come for both of us,

653
01:14:19,293 --> 01:14:22,134
and that could be the
opportunity for something else.

654
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:23,947
This isn't about revenge.

655
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:25,218
Yes, it is.

656
01:14:25,841 --> 01:14:28,052
And it won't be done
until one of us is dead.

657
01:14:28,886 --> 01:14:30,829
Get to the airport.

658
01:14:30,929 --> 01:14:33,100
We have a problem
with Iron Hand.

659
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:36,229
Copy that.

660
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:45,969
Give me a sit-rep.

661
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:47,596
We've got nothing.

662
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:48,987
Keep looking.

663
01:14:55,954 --> 01:14:57,335
Drive.

664
01:15:02,753 --> 01:15:03,987
It wasn't supposed
to go like this.

665
01:15:04,087 --> 01:15:05,155
I wanted to talk.

666
01:15:05,255 --> 01:15:06,916
Where's Dewey going?

667
01:15:10,886 --> 01:15:14,832
He's going to Vegas to speak with
Aaron Kalloor at a cyber convention.

668
01:15:14,932 --> 01:15:17,668
The Agency recruits
there every year.

669
01:15:17,768 --> 01:15:19,099
What's Iron Hand?

670
01:15:21,772 --> 01:15:23,063
Dewey's new black-ops program.

671
01:15:24,233 --> 01:15:26,260
Full-spectrum surveillance.

672
01:15:26,360 --> 01:15:28,929
Watching everyone all the time.

673
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:31,870
Dewey needs Kalloor's
cooperation to bring it online.

674
01:15:34,576 --> 01:15:35,577
Let me out.

675
01:15:37,913 --> 01:15:38,964
I can help you get there.

676
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:44,633
Why would you do that?

677
01:15:44,753 --> 01:15:48,382
You and I have different reasons,
but we both want Dewey gone.

678
01:15:52,845 --> 01:15:53,896
Here, take this.

679
01:16:08,443 --> 01:16:09,994
I'll see you in Vegas.

680
01:16:35,179 --> 01:16:36,600
Sir.

681
01:16:37,306 --> 01:16:40,000
We're pinning Kalloor's hit
on a fictional jihadi shooter.

682
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,101
A 20-year-old Iraqi national.

683
01:16:42,269 --> 01:16:45,360
We created bank accounts, travel
documents, e-mails, phone records.

684
01:16:46,356 --> 01:16:47,508
He'll look like a lone wolf.

685
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:48,779
Any physical evidence?

686
01:16:48,942 --> 01:16:52,073
The Asset leaves the gun. It'll
have the Iraqi's prints on it.

687
01:16:53,697 --> 01:16:55,908
Russell doesn't need
to know about this.

688
01:16:58,535 --> 01:17:00,036
I understand, sir.

689
01:17:01,038 --> 01:17:02,709
Any news on Bourne?

690
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:04,081
Nothing.

691
01:17:06,126 --> 01:17:08,207
He was always gonna come for me.

692
01:17:10,923 --> 01:17:12,924
Well, if it happens,
we'll deal with it.

693
01:17:50,045 --> 01:17:52,706
What was the purpose of your
visit to London, Mr. Michaels?

694
01:17:53,882 --> 01:17:55,383
Business.

695
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:21,868
Welcome home, sir.

696
01:18:23,453 --> 01:18:24,454
Thank you.

697
01:18:39,928 --> 01:18:41,679
Parking lot clear.
You're good to go.

698
01:18:46,143 --> 01:18:47,894
Sir, we have a secure room
for you, right upstairs.

699
01:19:49,039 --> 01:19:50,540
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

700
01:19:52,042 --> 01:19:53,503
Hi, welcome to the Aria.

701
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:55,800
- Heather Lee, checking in.
- Okay.

702
01:20:02,177 --> 01:20:04,888
We have you in a lovely
Sky Suite. Number 2016.

703
01:20:05,722 --> 01:20:06,790
Enjoy your stay.

704
01:20:06,890 --> 01:20:07,891
Thank you.

705
01:20:15,899 --> 01:20:17,480
Aaron!

706
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:21,472
All right, Aaron!

707
01:20:21,572 --> 01:20:22,743
Deep Dream!

708
01:20:34,585 --> 01:20:36,487
Find Lee.

709
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:38,798
Tell her I want to see her
before we go on stage.

710
01:20:38,922 --> 01:20:40,240
Yes, sir.

711
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,659
I want agents posted backstage
as well as the auditorium.

712
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:43,890
Yes, sir.

713
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:55,672
Coming through, make a hole.

714
01:20:55,772 --> 01:20:57,903
Make a hole, make a hole.

715
01:20:58,942 --> 01:21:00,302
Gonna make a quick stop here.

716
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:03,013
Hey, guys. Hi. How's
it going? Aaron.

717
01:21:03,113 --> 01:21:04,204
Good to meet you.

718
01:21:04,740 --> 01:21:05,871
Can I get one?

719
01:21:08,368 --> 01:21:09,789
Thanks very much
for your hard work.

720
01:21:13,040 --> 01:21:14,108
Thank you.

721
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:16,209
You're doing a great job.

722
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:48,492
Yeah.

723
01:21:48,742 --> 01:21:50,123
You all set?

724
01:21:50,285 --> 01:21:52,312
Checking the
departure route now.

725
01:21:52,412 --> 01:21:54,333
You won't have much time.

726
01:21:54,748 --> 01:21:57,999
They won't know where it came
from. I'll have enough time.

727
01:21:59,294 --> 01:22:02,072
After you take care of Kalloor, I'll
be standing, left hand at my side.

728
01:22:02,172 --> 01:22:03,213
You put a bullet in it.

729
01:22:03,340 --> 01:22:05,381
It's better if
I'm a target, too.

730
01:22:06,510 --> 01:22:07,721
Copy that.

731
01:22:47,384 --> 01:22:48,395
Lee.

732
01:22:51,054 --> 01:22:53,065
The Director wants a word
before you go on stage.

733
01:22:54,558 --> 01:22:55,849
Of course.

734
01:23:18,582 --> 01:23:19,583
ID?

735
01:23:20,167 --> 01:23:21,168
Thanks.

736
01:23:46,527 --> 01:23:47,528
Heather.

737
01:23:48,779 --> 01:23:51,410
My protge.
Strongest supporter.

738
01:23:52,115 --> 01:23:55,352
You know, after what happened in London,
I did not know what to do with you.

739
01:23:55,452 --> 01:24:00,424
I suppose we'll just, um, write
it off to your learning curve.

740
01:24:01,124 --> 01:24:02,545
I'd appreciate that.

741
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:06,635
At least you can now see
that you never had a chance.

742
01:24:07,256 --> 01:24:10,033
When Bourne turns up again,
I'll deal with him.

743
01:24:10,133 --> 01:24:11,702
Do you understand?

744
01:24:11,802 --> 01:24:13,370
Of course.

745
01:24:13,470 --> 01:24:15,101
I agree completely.

746
01:24:17,975 --> 01:24:19,526
When we get on stage,

747
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:22,463
I'll handle all the policy questions,
throw everything technical to you.

748
01:24:22,563 --> 01:24:23,630
I'll be ready, sir.

749
01:24:23,730 --> 01:24:25,321
Okay, let's do this.

750
01:24:35,909 --> 01:24:37,160
Badges?

751
01:24:54,344 --> 01:24:55,395
Aaron.

752
01:24:56,346 --> 01:24:57,347
Robert.

753
01:24:59,183 --> 01:25:00,814
You know Heather Lee.

754
01:25:04,605 --> 01:25:06,906
Yeah, we went to
Stanford together.

755
01:25:07,566 --> 01:25:10,147
Wow. How are you enjoying
life at the Agency?

756
01:25:10,402 --> 01:25:12,993
Challenging. But fulfilling.

757
01:25:13,822 --> 01:25:16,703
It's tough to stay true
to your principles over there?

758
01:25:17,201 --> 01:25:19,492
My principles are
just fine, thanks.

759
01:25:20,871 --> 01:25:23,190
Gentlemen, we're ready for you.
Follow me, please.

760
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,291
I'm going to enjoy this.

761
01:25:25,626 --> 01:25:27,167
So am I.

762
01:25:40,724 --> 01:25:42,235
Thank you, sir.

763
01:26:03,413 --> 01:26:06,170
Oh! Hi! How's everybody
doing tonight?

764
01:26:06,708 --> 01:26:08,209
Welcome.

765
01:26:10,754 --> 01:26:12,095
Welcome.

766
01:26:13,590 --> 01:26:17,221
Welcome to tonight's
EXOCON Symposium.

767
01:26:17,594 --> 01:26:21,475
We are so lucky to have four
fantastic guests this evening.

768
01:26:22,099 --> 01:26:25,390
The CIA Director,
Robert Dewey, is here.

769
01:26:27,604 --> 01:26:31,175
And a dear friend of mine,
and an old friend of EXOCON,

770
01:26:31,275 --> 01:26:36,292
the CEO of social-media giant
Deep Dream, Aaron Kalloor is here.

771
01:27:09,271 --> 01:27:13,022
Tonight, "Policing
a free Internet,

772
01:27:13,901 --> 01:27:16,822
"personal rights
versus public safety."

773
01:27:17,154 --> 01:27:19,598
This is the great
question of our time.

774
01:27:19,698 --> 01:27:22,529
And the choices we make about
this will determine our future.

775
01:27:23,285 --> 01:27:25,836
So let's just dive
right in, okay?

776
01:27:27,623 --> 01:27:29,044
Come on out here, guys.

777
01:27:29,499 --> 01:27:31,860
Sir, you've got an
incoming message.

778
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:32,961
High priority.

779
01:27:34,171 --> 01:27:35,781
All right, guys, I'm
gonna have to take this.

780
01:27:35,881 --> 01:27:37,991
I'll catch up with you later.

781
01:27:38,091 --> 01:27:39,597
Go ahead.

782
01:27:47,142 --> 01:27:48,853
Thanks for having me. Hey.

783
01:27:59,530 --> 01:28:01,932
It appears Director Dewey
is held up momentarily,

784
01:28:02,032 --> 01:28:05,543
and I am being told that it
shouldn't be too much longer.

785
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:07,229
But we have a ton of stuff
to get into tonight,

786
01:28:07,329 --> 01:28:10,326
- so we can start anyway...
- Brad? Brad, could I say a few words?

787
01:28:10,791 --> 01:28:12,502
- Excuse me?
- Can I get the ball rolling?

788
01:28:12,668 --> 01:28:16,742
Oh, sure, man, by all means. Ladies
and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.

789
01:28:27,891 --> 01:28:28,932
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

790
01:28:30,227 --> 01:28:32,546
Thanks a lot to Brad
and all the folks at EXOCON

791
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:36,195
for having us back,
and to you guys for turning out.

792
01:28:37,234 --> 01:28:39,803
Before the Director
comes out to join us,

793
01:28:39,903 --> 01:28:42,574
I just wanted to share
a few words with you guys.

794
01:28:42,865 --> 01:28:45,246
A long time ago,
I had this idea.

795
01:28:45,659 --> 01:28:48,228
- Copy that.
- A beautiful idea, to create a place, online...

796
01:28:48,328 --> 01:28:49,730
Facial recognition got a hit.

797
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:51,857
Bourne was on a BA flight
from Heathrow to Vegas.

798
01:28:51,957 --> 01:28:53,458
It landed two hours ago.

799
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:56,612
How the hell did he get
through immigration?

800
01:28:56,712 --> 01:29:00,111
Someone issued him an Agency
security clearance on his passport.

801
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:04,086
Well, it turned out to be
a pretty popular idea.

802
01:29:05,095 --> 01:29:07,506
People from around the world
started using our service.

803
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:23,956
Well, first off, this has all made me a
lot more rich than is probably healthy.

804
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:28,123
When I come on stage, take
care of Kalloor and the girl.

805
01:29:28,785 --> 01:29:30,406
Copy.

806
01:29:30,537 --> 01:29:32,022
But, what I mean to
say is that, you know,

807
01:29:32,122 --> 01:29:34,123
all this success
has come at a cost.

808
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:38,096
There is a cancer at
the heart of Deep Dream.

809
01:29:40,005 --> 01:29:42,186
A guilty secret, and, um...

810
01:29:43,217 --> 01:29:44,743
I have to share it
with all of you guys.

811
01:29:44,843 --> 01:29:47,644
Son of a bitch is about to take us down.
Take out Kalloor and the girl right now.

812
01:29:52,726 --> 01:29:53,726
Whoa, whoa...

813
01:29:53,810 --> 01:29:55,481
- Stay there.
- Okay.

814
01:29:56,813 --> 01:29:58,984
When I was starting
out, I, uh...

815
01:29:59,983 --> 01:30:02,324
I took money to
start my company.

816
01:30:04,988 --> 01:30:06,909
Made a bargain with a
guy in a dark suit...

817
01:30:10,118 --> 01:30:12,409
...and now he's come
back to take my soul.

818
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:22,463
I see the shooter!

819
01:30:22,506 --> 01:30:24,575
We've got eyes on Jason Bourne.

820
01:30:24,675 --> 01:30:26,186
He's still breathing.
Call an ambulance!

821
01:30:26,343 --> 01:30:27,344
Go, go!

822
01:30:28,637 --> 01:30:30,508
- Let's go!
- Sir, we gotta go.

823
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:44,821
Head for the exit!

824
01:30:47,948 --> 01:30:49,699
This is Vasquez.
We're on Bourne.

825
01:30:49,867 --> 01:30:51,028
Get the cars ready!

826
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:53,329
Get the cars ready right now!

827
01:30:53,495 --> 01:30:54,772
No, take me to the suite.

828
01:30:54,872 --> 01:30:57,107
Sir, we've got to get you out
of here. Bourne is on the loose.

829
01:30:57,207 --> 01:31:00,402
You heard me. Take
me to the suite.

830
01:31:00,502 --> 01:31:01,528
Yes, sir.

831
01:31:01,628 --> 01:31:03,614
Take him to the suite.
Take him upstairs.

832
01:31:03,714 --> 01:31:04,765
Get him upstairs.

833
01:31:04,882 --> 01:31:05,883
Right now. Right now.

834
01:31:06,216 --> 01:31:07,217
Up to the suite.

835
01:31:07,885 --> 01:31:09,495
- Let's go, right now. Go, go, go!
- Yes, sir.

836
01:31:09,595 --> 01:31:13,106
Come this way. This way.
Don't worry. Come on.

837
01:31:17,769 --> 01:31:19,560
Out of the way! Federal agent!

838
01:31:27,738 --> 01:31:29,529
Vasquez, sit-rep.

839
01:31:29,948 --> 01:31:31,279
Vasquez, come in!

840
01:31:34,077 --> 01:31:35,078
Hey!

841
01:31:53,722 --> 01:31:55,853
Okay, we've got him.
Sir, this is Collier.

842
01:31:56,016 --> 01:31:58,001
- We've ID'd the sniper.
- Shit.

843
01:31:58,101 --> 01:31:59,670
We're circulating his photo now.

844
01:31:59,770 --> 01:32:01,130
What about Bourne?

845
01:32:01,230 --> 01:32:03,191
Hang on.

846
01:32:03,315 --> 01:32:06,783
Okay, Bourne is just leaving the west
service corridor, heading for the lobby.

847
01:32:06,902 --> 01:32:08,613
Copy that. Stay on Bourne.

848
01:32:11,281 --> 01:32:12,349
What?

849
01:32:12,449 --> 01:32:15,698
We're still looking for Bourne.
And they've ID'd the Asset.

850
01:32:32,886 --> 01:32:35,038
Go back to the first floor and
wait for further instructions.

851
01:32:35,138 --> 01:32:36,719
- Yes, sir. Copy that.
- Copy that.

852
01:32:53,866 --> 01:32:56,027
Everybody down! Right now!

853
01:32:56,243 --> 01:32:57,624
Down, move, move, move!

854
01:32:59,162 --> 01:33:01,163
Out of the way!
Federal agents! Move!

855
01:33:24,188 --> 01:33:27,019
Take a team to the northeast
elevators. I'll meet you up there.

856
01:33:34,823 --> 01:33:36,704
Bourne's on his way up to you.

857
01:34:26,500 --> 01:34:29,211
You took a long time
to get here, Jason.

858
01:34:30,254 --> 01:34:31,925
I know about Beirut.

859
01:34:32,756 --> 01:34:34,257
I know what you did.

860
01:34:35,801 --> 01:34:37,432
It all ends tonight.

861
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:40,432
Be a lot easier to
do it right away.

862
01:34:47,855 --> 01:34:49,506
You didn't come
here for revenge.

863
01:34:49,606 --> 01:34:52,727
You came here because
you know it's time to come in.

864
01:35:00,325 --> 01:35:02,286
Your father created the program.

865
01:35:02,995 --> 01:35:05,689
Didn't have what it
takes to make it work.

866
01:35:05,789 --> 01:35:07,040
And you did.

867
01:35:08,083 --> 01:35:09,464
You always did.

868
01:35:11,879 --> 01:35:13,447
That's why you volunteered.

869
01:35:13,547 --> 01:35:16,548
I volunteered because I
thought our enemies killed him.

870
01:35:18,051 --> 01:35:19,620
I volunteered because of a lie.

871
01:35:19,720 --> 01:35:22,539
No, you volunteered
because of who you are.

872
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:24,875
You volunteered because
you are Jason Bourne,

873
01:35:24,975 --> 01:35:27,526
and not David Webb.

874
01:35:37,404 --> 01:35:39,075
Thirty-two kills, Jason.

875
01:35:39,489 --> 01:35:41,225
Every one of them
made a difference.

876
01:35:41,325 --> 01:35:45,626
People all across this country
are safer because of what you did.

877
01:35:57,007 --> 01:35:58,838
I'm trying to find another way.

878
01:36:03,096 --> 01:36:05,307
And how's that
working out for you?

879
01:36:13,106 --> 01:36:15,027
You're never going
to find any peace.

880
01:36:16,735 --> 01:36:19,946
Not until you admit to yourself
who you really are.

881
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:24,030
It's time to come in, Jason.

882
01:36:25,953 --> 01:36:27,374
It's time to come in.

883
01:36:34,002 --> 01:36:35,213
I can't.

884
01:36:40,551 --> 01:36:41,552
Not for you.

885
01:37:17,337 --> 01:37:18,838
You were never here.

886
01:37:26,722 --> 01:37:27,893
You don't have to go after him.

887
01:37:31,518 --> 01:37:32,889
This can stop now.

888
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:35,815
You have a choice.

889
01:37:58,545 --> 01:38:00,126
- Let's go!
- Have your IDs ready.

890
01:38:00,422 --> 01:38:03,053
Have your IDs ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

891
01:38:04,134 --> 01:38:06,895
Have your IDs ready! Come
on, guys, let's go, let's go!

892
01:38:13,810 --> 01:38:16,981
Stand in a line. Las Vegas
Police, ladies and gentlemen!

893
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:02,092
BearCat SWAT truck
and unmarked black Dodge Charger

894
01:39:02,192 --> 01:39:03,448
stolen from the
front of the Aria.

895
01:39:10,784 --> 01:39:12,895
Pursuit in progress.
Air support requested.

896
01:39:12,995 --> 01:39:14,126
What was that ID?

897
01:43:26,081 --> 01:43:27,752
Stop him! Block that road!

898
01:43:31,086 --> 01:43:32,087
Oh, my God!

899
01:43:34,298 --> 01:43:35,299
Fire!

900
01:43:38,719 --> 01:43:39,720
Move out!

901
01:44:24,848 --> 01:44:25,849
Move!

902
01:44:29,186 --> 01:44:31,255
Next two units
involved, identify.

903
01:44:31,355 --> 01:44:33,882
This is Air 1. Be
advised, suspect vehicles

904
01:44:33,982 --> 01:44:35,943
have crashed into the southeast
entrance of the Riviera.

905
01:44:47,579 --> 01:44:50,925
We have an armed suspect heading into
the storm drain south of the Riviera.

906
01:46:40,776 --> 01:46:43,447
You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.

907
01:46:44,488 --> 01:46:45,819
It's in your blood.

908
01:48:09,907 --> 01:48:11,408
Mr. Kalloor!

909
01:48:12,910 --> 01:48:15,479
Aaron! What were you going to
tell everyone at the convention?

910
01:48:15,579 --> 01:48:17,147
What are you hiding, Aaron?

911
01:48:17,247 --> 01:48:18,248
Easy.

912
01:48:18,616 --> 01:48:20,943
Why did somebody try
to assassinate you?

913
01:48:21,043 --> 01:48:23,254
What's the cancer at the heart
of Deep Dream?

914
01:48:23,378 --> 01:48:25,864
I think it would be inappropriate
to pass any comment at this stage,

915
01:48:25,964 --> 01:48:27,866
but I look forward to
working with the authorities

916
01:48:27,966 --> 01:48:29,535
to find out who was responsible.

917
01:48:29,635 --> 01:48:30,828
And to getting
back to Deep Dream,

918
01:48:30,928 --> 01:48:33,259
where we can continue
our important work. Thank you.

919
01:48:34,097 --> 01:48:35,928
Have you been lying
to your users?

920
01:49:07,714 --> 01:49:08,725
Sir.

921
01:49:18,767 --> 01:49:20,478
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

922
01:49:21,353 --> 01:49:22,984
About Vegas.

923
01:49:23,188 --> 01:49:26,925
Director Dewey's
tactics were unwise.

924
01:49:27,025 --> 01:49:28,436
Unwise?

925
01:49:29,278 --> 01:49:31,989
We're still trying to come up with a
narrative to explain what happened.

926
01:49:32,531 --> 01:49:36,532
That son of a bitch put
a spotlight on Iron Hand.

927
01:49:37,286 --> 01:49:38,812
On all of us.

928
01:49:38,912 --> 01:49:40,963
Kalloor hasn't gone public yet.

929
01:49:42,749 --> 01:49:43,960
I know Aaron.

930
01:49:45,085 --> 01:49:47,166
There are still moves
we can make with him.

931
01:49:50,299 --> 01:49:51,510
Tell me.

932
01:49:52,134 --> 01:49:55,015
Dewey's problem was
that he belonged in the past.

933
01:49:56,680 --> 01:49:58,681
People like Kalloor
are shaping the future.

934
01:49:59,641 --> 01:50:01,062
These are my people.

935
01:50:02,436 --> 01:50:04,597
I know how to deal with him.

936
01:50:07,524 --> 01:50:09,445
And what do you want?

937
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:12,262
When you appoint a
new Agency Director,

938
01:50:12,362 --> 01:50:15,283
you're going to need someone
working for your interests.

939
01:50:16,491 --> 01:50:17,662
Someone

940
01:50:18,827 --> 01:50:21,078
empowered by you.

941
01:50:24,666 --> 01:50:25,707
What about Bourne?

942
01:50:27,252 --> 01:50:29,503
You still think you
can bring him in?

943
01:50:32,299 --> 01:50:33,760
I have his trust.

944
01:50:34,718 --> 01:50:35,889
After what we went through.

945
01:50:37,971 --> 01:50:39,373
I'll bring him in.

946
01:50:39,473 --> 01:50:41,224
I'm certain of it.

947
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,441
And if you can't?

948
01:50:47,022 --> 01:50:50,653
Then he'll have to be put down.

949
01:50:54,404 --> 01:50:56,575
It's an interesting proposal.

950
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:03,001
You can pull over here.

951
01:51:07,876 --> 01:51:12,377
Of course, if you decide that you don't
need me, then that's not a problem.

952
01:51:13,048 --> 01:51:16,179
There are many other agencies
who would want what I know.

953
01:51:45,956 --> 01:51:47,457
I brought you something.

954
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:57,185
It's a cast from your father's star,
on the Memorial Wall at Langley.

955
01:52:07,477 --> 01:52:09,268
I'm sorry for what
happened to you.

956
01:52:12,149 --> 01:52:13,550
How you were treated.

957
01:52:13,650 --> 01:52:16,261
But the people that
did that are gone,

958
01:52:16,361 --> 01:52:19,890
and things are
changing at the Agency.

959
01:52:19,990 --> 01:52:21,571
What is it you want?

960
01:52:24,912 --> 01:52:26,753
I know you've always
been a patriot.

961
01:52:28,540 --> 01:52:31,331
That what happens to this
country matters to you.

962
01:52:32,878 --> 01:52:34,799
We need you to help protect us.

963
01:52:36,465 --> 01:52:37,766
Come back in.

964
01:52:39,927 --> 01:52:41,718
And we'll work together.

965
01:52:49,645 --> 01:52:51,156
Let me think about it.

966
01:52:52,397 --> 01:52:53,818
How will I find you?

967
01:53:40,320 --> 01:53:42,451
You still think you
can bring him in?

968
01:53:42,573 --> 01:53:44,244
I have his trust.

969
01:53:44,992 --> 01:53:46,663
After what we went through.

970
01:53:47,703 --> 01:53:48,874
I'll bring him in.

971
01:53:49,538 --> 01:53:51,039
