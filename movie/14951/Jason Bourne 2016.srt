是的，先生。

當我們與您完成後，你將不再是大衛・韋伯。

這甚至不是還沒有運營，為基督的緣故。

70

哪裡是尼基・帕森斯現在

你將如何處理它

75
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,100
我們切頭了這件事情。

76
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,630
先生。我希望能在這個工作點。

77
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,140
- 你不是被灌輸了這種材料。 - 我已經進去。

00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,120
我會送帕森斯，文件，

81

但，

84
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,120
- 不要再把你的個人議程，在DEI。 - 解讀。

85
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,160
好吧，我想你能幫助我。

86

西隔雅典。我有兩個地方隊途中。

100
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,400
- 伯恩的跡象 - 不太遠。

101
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,270
他參與這個不知何故，我能感覺到。

102
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,010

我們在哪

卡森的assett剛剛到達Syntayma廣場。

107
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,920
有一個在納塔利婭大樓前示威。

108
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,690
我想她會用它作為封面。

109
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,170
在廣場前，

110
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,370
我們進來帕森斯，在議會配對，以及任何可能的磨合與伯恩。

111
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,390
複製，先生。爵士，資產已經登陸。

112
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,380
- 阿爾法小組目前到達。 - 收到。

113
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,740
- 我有阿爾法小隊飼料。 - 拉起來。

114
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,400
雅典警方報告是球隊戰術上移動的示威者。

115
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,050
- 從隔離廣場的所有社交媒體文章。 - 是的女士。

116
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,840
- 阿爾法倒回一個人的飼料。 - 是的女士。二十秒。

117
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,750
- 什麼是錯的 - 我砍死機構。

118
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,640
-  19：11.75。

119
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,870
我砍死所有黑色行動文件，包括阿瑪尼。

120
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,420
誰你這樣做

121
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,640
停止。

122
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,370
兩秒鐘。長髮。

123
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,120
增強。

124
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,110
找她。

125
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,140
- 我告訴你，達索是會得到你殺了。 - 我們沒有選擇，賈森。

126
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,350
他們又開始了，一個新的節目，鐵手。它比以前更差。

127
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,220
- 那是什麼必須做的跟我 - 因為它很重要。它很重要。

128
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,520
對我來說，它沒有。

129
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,210
所有重要的是活著。你下車網格，生存。

130
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,250
我不相信這一點，你也一樣。

131
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,150
看看你自己。

132
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,150
看看你在做什麼。

133
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,700
你不能這樣活更長的時間。

134
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,970
賈森，我來到這裡是因為我發現了什麼。

135
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,530
我找到了你父親的紋石文件。

136
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,570
他是一個分析師。他不是在操作。

137
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,340
- 他是不靠近任何東西。 - 我告訴你我所看到的。

138
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,780
它看起來像他直接參與。

139
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,840
- 還有更多。更多關於你的。 - 你什麼意思

140
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,660
在您加入該計劃，他們在看你。

141
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,970
看著我

142
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,650
您現在折磨自己很長一段時間，賈森。

143
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,250
你不知道他們對你做了什麼真相。

144
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,120
你需要閱讀這些文件。

145
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,430
移動

146
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,610
一號有兩個目標的眼睛。一雌一雄。

147
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:05,740
- 確定男性。 - 收到。

148
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,940
- 確定男性。 - 收到。

149
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,870
你得離開這裡之前，他們這個城市的一部分。

150
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,320
北頭。

151
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,090
迎接我的雅典娜雕像。

152
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,900
- 我會帶他們遠離你。 - 嘿，別！

153
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,930
就是他。

154
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,310
現在。

155
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,270
伯恩。 。

156
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,250
- 清搞的目標。 - 複製。

157
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,900
爵士，Alpha小隊的通訊科下降。

158
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,140
我們已經失去了支持小組第3

159
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,790
-  22：55.880。

160
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,900
-  22：58.790

161
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,300
爵士，騷亂開始爆發和雅典宣佈緊急狀態。

162
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,990
我們得到了她。

163
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,740
第二隊把她放進一個盒子裡。

164
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,170
犯罪嫌疑人最後一次看到報道上警用摩托車。他向北。

165
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,300
- 如果地獄是資產 - 兩分鐘了，先生。

166
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,760
- 卡森是雅典娜的塑像。 - 收到。

167
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,170
- 團隊已關閉。 - 爵士的資產抵達現場。

168
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,840
菲利普天哪下來，給我直接通訊的資產。

169
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,050
-  26：57.720。

170
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,400
- 我需要眼睛的開銷。 - 匯入衛星的飼料。

171
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,330
它們實際上是。十二個??可用衛星。

172
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,620
-  27：20.320。 - 是的先生。

173
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,040
飼料在線。

174
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,530
-  27：38.40屏障。 - 目標是將被迫左轉。

175
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,270
另一個路障200米。目標左轉。

176
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,750
伯恩正在走向胡同。在山頂的左上方。

177
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,710
在這裡，下了車。他去哪兒

178
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,620
找到出路。 200米到你的左邊。 19所羅門。

179
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,960
獲得到屋頂。伯恩會被你行的視線通。

180
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
我看到士兵們的到來。

181
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,150
-  29：12.000。

182
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,000
-  29：12.2000。 - 收到。

183
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,080
在逼近和Harmonien 50的目標。

184
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,140
-  29：47.040。

185
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,240
即將在你55秒。

186
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,050
收到。

187
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:18,470
-  30：18.960。

188
00:30:30,570 --> 00:30:33,600
15秒內你的目標。

189
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,830
5秒。

190
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,800
- 聯繫。保持在低水平！

191
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,020
一桿。

192
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,650
堅持，稍等。

193
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,950
哪裡的伯恩

194
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,240
頂部警方已在該資產襲擊屋頂發現了三具屍體。

195
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,680
球隊的它的方式。

196
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,740
尼基。

197
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,570
不要動。

198
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,110
隊的戰術已經進入大樓。

199
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,320
- 資產，你需要離開那裡。 - 負

200
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,450
我們甚至不知道伯恩仍然活著。

201
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,840
因此，已經一去不復返了。

202
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,030
這是導演杜威，27已經一去不復返了。

203
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,800
等一下，尼基。

204
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,980
我要得到你覆蓋。

205
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,600
不，不行。

206
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,770
我來了..

207
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,550
地點是在這個辦公室裡，先生。

208
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,130
如果他與帕森斯Nikky工作，他將建議伯恩。

209
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,150
讓我知道，如果你獲得惡意軟件的一個打擊。

210
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,050
主席先生，我能澄清一件事。

211
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,300
-  34：20.040

212
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
加上他至今想伯恩。

213
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,170
-  34：22.280

214
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,410
他的行為或意志力

215
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,970
並建議connectioin。

216
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,260
上一次伯恩回來，他露出黑色荊棘程序。

217
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,780
他損害了準確的操作。

218
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,620
而在敘利亞的資產，下蓋。

219
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,110
他被抓獲，並遭受酷刑。並採取了該死的近一年來得到他。

220
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,060
所以，你認為這就是為什麼伯恩想要的文件。要重新上市

221
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,910
我不知道為什麼他回來了。

222
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,030
但是，不管他在幹什麼，他想要摧毀我們。

223
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,860
我不能讓這種情況發生。

224
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,320
所以，請給我打電話，一旦你聽到什麼。

225
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,800
是的先生。

225
00:35:06,800 --> 00:36:36,150

- 紋石 IronHand  - 理查德韋伯涉案。 JB監視之下。

227
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,210
而現在的創始人和深DREAM董事長..亞倫Kalloor。

228
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,840
啊，你知道你為什麼在這裡。我們將推出一個新的平台。

229
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,040
我們認為這是一個大膽的新的一步，使我們能夠為我們的社會更好。

230
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,880
我們在轉向現在就trascend國界，和

231
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,650
我認為我們在1.5億用戶。

232
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,080
你知道我們的應用程序幾十萬的生態系統在這一點上。

233
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,970
什麼這個新的平台將做的是整合

234
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,220
用戶的數據和喜好，

235
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,110
並利用這些信息，來豐富和量身打造

236
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,350
每一個獨特的用戶體驗，在某種程度上這是坦率地說

237
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,720
史無前例的。

238
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,330
現在，我可以看到一些記者的大腦抽搐，隨時可以問隱私。

239
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,420
這是許多人關心的問題，所以它應該是。

240
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,870
這是一件關係到我們，我只想說

241
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,120
我明白了，誰也不想感覺好像他們正在觀看

242
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,860
因此，讓我們只是告訴你，當你來到DEEP夢想，當您使用我們的服務。

243
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,150
沒有人會看著你。

244
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,810
- 享受你的飯 - 謝謝你。

245
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,340
恭喜你，

246
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,040
我聽說你的股票持有人很高興與新的平台。

247
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,110
我聽說你被黑。

248
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,310
你之前是 。

249
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,800
這改變了一切。有太多的風險。

250
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,770
- 我出去了。 - 嘿，

251
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,460
你是一個額外的普通天賦和敏銳的年輕人。

252
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,600
你同意幫助我們，那是因為你理解了非常嚴重的威脅，

253
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,690
你有想法在我們的手狗屎風暴，如果這種安排公開上市

254
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,960
我同意了，而你更..

255
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,530
我們的敵人已經變得更加複雜。

256
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,090
收集的元數據不再足夠。

257
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,950
我們需要一個後門到新的平台，在某種程度上

258
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,770
-  40：28.680。 - 如果這還不夠，你想要新的東西。

259
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,920
你..你不明白，你

260
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,830
隱私是,,是，自由。

261
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,760
我相信這件事情，你應該想想衛冕。

262
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,560
你這個小刺，你不信的隱私或自由時，

263
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,680
當你開始。我已經把你變成億萬富翁。

264
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,470
我已經付過你回來很多，很多，很多次。

265
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,370
而我不舒服的任何現象。我出去了。

266
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,730
- 我做過出賣我們的客??戶。 - 然而，你會出賣你的國家。

267
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,050
事實是，我們我就不會被這次談話，如果你沒感覺

268
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
個人處於危險之中。

269
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,430
請您談一下一個免費的網絡，你告訴自己你是拯救世界，

270
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,480
所有你正在做的是使之成為一個更加危險的地方。而且你肯定是地獄

271
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,600
使這個國家更加難以防守。

272
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,650
而你肯定是地獄該負責。

273
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,370
柏林，德國

當然。

277
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,920
伯恩浮出水面。

278
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,480
- 在柏林。

279
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,260
獲得柏林小組出局。

280
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,680
- 她在哪裡 - 她死了。

281
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,800
她知道的風險。我欠她的。

282
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,000
她做了她的選擇。

283
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,080
你利用了她。

284
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,780
- 藍隊是流動的。 - 誰讓我們中的位置

285
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,950
- 我們可以嘗試找到基督教達索。 - 我們可以把更多一點

286
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,650
不上的應用程序。現在我激活CC電視。

287
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,370
所以，我一直在想，

288
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,400
如果我們走這有什麼錯

289
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,030
如果他們還來什麼對我們

290
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,700
如果它是別的東西

291
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,760
你不知道你在和誰打交道的任何想法。

292
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,020
我們應該共同努力，更多。

293
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,990
我們都有同樣的事情的權利。

294
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,200
你揭露。

295
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,170
我們都希望取下來的那個控制社會。

296
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,670
我不就在你身邊。

297
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,700

301
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,720
是的先生。

東西，

313
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,450

有一天，你就會明白為什麼。

我得回華盛頓。

00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,100
我愛你，兒子。

317
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,230
他們的戰鬥，先生。

318
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,960
還有一個防火牆。

319
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,630
刪除文件，先生。

320
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,940
叫它。

321
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,880
伯恩，我的名字是希瑟李某。

322
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,130
我不是這裡的負責人。

323
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,460
我不在這裡，當你人失蹤。

324
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,610
我可以看到你經歷的老紋石文件。

325
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,780
你跟蹤你的歷史

326
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,960
我知道你正在尋找的東西。

327
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,850
讓我知道如果你找到它。

328
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,780
給我電話。

329
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,760
是的先生。

330
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,200
傑森，這是羅伯特・杜威。你記得我嗎

331
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,990
- 傑森，你爸爸是個愛國者。

332
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,640
他看到在面對美國人的威脅。

333
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,490
之所以選擇以服務跨越他國

334
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,750
平衡它，埃迪。

335
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,900
放棄

336
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,960
但要看到你在局。

337
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,560
-  52:34。

338
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,810
我在這裡現在就停止了。

339
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,150
TEAM抵達。你有2分鐘。

340
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,750
我們失去了他，先生。

341
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,300
馬爾科姆・史密斯，合同只，立足於倫敦

342
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,660
然所有Tradestone在90年代後期，監視，當伯恩被徵召。

343
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,450
- 他是仍然活躍 - 他現在是私人保安。

344
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:50,200
聯繫資產，並告訴他我們要淹死，並在6個小時murderd誰。

345
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,070
我會......在Stickson。

346
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,030
他會生病，會不會他

347
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,220
The'res追趕伯恩。而不是殺害他。

348
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,390
好吧，讓我們來聽聽。

349
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,710
伯恩一直離網很長一段時間。

350
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,260
他一直躲在暗處。他見過的東西。

351
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,490
他知道的事情，能幫助我們。

352
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,290
把他帶回來的，是聰明之舉。

353
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,190
而我們如何做

354
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,340
我會和伯恩的方案。

355
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,040
他總結伯恩仍處於心臟愛國者。

356
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:25,160
把我背到程序和。

357
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,680
- 和你在哪裡建議 - 我會看著伯恩。

358
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,620
拚命，但我們的intests過去了，...

359
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,930
我可以排序技術。

360
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,190
如果我能面對面與他。

361
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,550
我想我可以把他帶回去。

362
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,250
一次。如果失敗..

363
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,360
你不必..

364
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,270
嗯，這對我來說很有意義。你覺得呢，鮑勃・

365
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,010
讓我們給它一個鏡頭。

366
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,970
好吧，做到這一點。

367
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,770
伯恩帶來的，

368
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,110
我們將配合它關閉。

369
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,640
- 現在，這結束。 - 謝謝你，先生。

370
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,040
- 先生，我很抱歉。 - 不，不，不。

371
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,200
最好睡一會兒，孩子。

372
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,230
你不希望24小時不看。

373
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,680
是的先生。

374
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,250
它的時間太長，它仍然不應該是這個車推出如此接近。

375
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,190
會如此馬車如果詹姆斯沒有取出來。

376
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,790
- 這是指標的影響，這將不得不去。 - 好吧，那麼我們將不得不改回來。

377
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,290
- 拉車了 - 當然。

378
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,920
我只是不認為我們要整片。

379
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,610
Kalloor先生，

380
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,150
Kalloor先生，我從司法部來的。

381
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,940
- 我在此為您服務與封閉的說法， - 真的，你必須這樣做公開

382
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,950
和深夢幻公司，違反了謝爾曼法。

383
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:25,300
這種說法需要你保存所有企業和個人財務記錄。

384
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,450
待定的滲透到聯邦法院提交。

385
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,850
美好的一天。

386
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,670
- 這是杜威。 - 阿倫，這是一個消息。

387
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,080
也許我們應該思考我們在做什麼，它變得更糟之前。

388
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,850
所以，你想，如果我們給他他想要的東西，它會結束。

389
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,270
我只是說，也許我們應該傾聽。

390
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,160
我要你拉了所有的會議保羅曾與我的所有記錄。

391
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,980
所有記錄

392
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,430
- 即使是現成的，書的討論 - 特別是那些。

393
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,730
我要去拉斯維加斯，我需要一份保險。

394
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:36,330
- 是啊。 - 你是在倫敦是。

395
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,810
誰是你現在發送

396
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,250
她服務的目的。

397
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,040
- 我單獨工作。 - 這次不行。

398
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,780
不要讓這種個人。

399
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,360
伯恩背叛了我們。這一直是個人。

400
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,820
當你準備好。

401
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,330
是啊 - 我需要一個保證。

402
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,040
我有你們的支持。

403
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,290
， 你有什麼

404
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,030
Kalloor，

405
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,360
是規劃的東西，為拉斯維加斯。

406
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,000
倫敦，英國

407
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,220
- 是 - 這是傑森・伯恩。

408
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,450
- 我需要談談。 - 關於什麼

409
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:15,980
- 我不為機構工作了。 - 奧布裡廣場，15分鐘。

410
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,400
伯恩只是叫史密斯。

411
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:50,920
他們在奧布裡廣場有15分鐘的會議。

412
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,790
-  1：01：47.720。

413
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,000
當我們在伯恩得到的眼神，我就接近他。

414
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,640
無論你說什麼，牽制他。

415
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,520
我不希望英國人都掉落在這個問問題。

416
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,980
埃，先生。

417
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,610
跟蹤裝置。

418
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,110
你擁在橋的南側。

419
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,620
如果我需要你，我會聯繫你的。

420
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,000
當然，

421
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,960
你是老闆，右

422
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,600
- 主題是在移動。 - 我現在可以。

423
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,310
Alpha小隊取。

424
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,690
Bravo小隊，從後面拉起來的話題。你睜大眼睛對於Bourne。

425
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,960
Bravo小隊，尾礦科目。

426
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,020
- 我們走吧。在200米設置你的商標。 - 收到。

427
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:24,910
通訊科檢查一下，第二個通道。你複製

428
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,810
- 我有你。你現在在哪裡 - 對標題。

429
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,970
伯恩的跡象。

430
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,140
- 主題是轉動東部。 - 走進一條小巷。

431
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,910
阿爾法隊，那胡同導致腳線索，這將導致他交給你。

432
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,600
收到。

433
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:37,060
Bravo小隊已關閉。從現在開始第二次更新。

434
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,060
複製，史密斯

435
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,400
是。

436
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:04,480
項目團隊，你為什麼不動怎麼回事

437
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,270
項目團隊，你複製

438
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,730
發生了什麼事，哪裡是布拉沃

439
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:13,200
通訊科下來布拉沃。

440
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,280
Akpha隊你有眼睛的主題

441
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,480
Alpha小隊，sitprep

442
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,620
- 阿爾法小組的報告。 - 發生了什麼希瑟

443
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:42,680
- 阿爾法隊沒有響應。 - 布拉沃

444
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,400
這是怎麼回事

445
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:47,860
你輸了兩支球隊這個操作，希瑟。這是伯恩。

446
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,080
襯托出資產。

447
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:53,260
- 主席先生，我需要更多的時間。 - 我們沒有時間。

448
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,910
- 你想給的順序或不 - 先生，請。

449
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:01,220
如果你太天真了，看樹，有一個在伯恩沒有自備。

450
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,520
他不得不放下。

451
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:08,000
你顯然不能做什麼有許多工作要做。我正在操作控制。

452
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,220
-  1：06：03.00。

453
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,540
- 你對伯恩綠燈。 - 收到。我對我的方式。

454
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,330
資產是你在移動

455
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,880
資產跟蹤設備說你是靜止的。

456
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,380
你動

457
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,370
Heaher留過這個通道，讓他做他的工作。

458
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,590
離開了這裡。起床奧布裡廣場，速度快。

459
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,840
在位置上。

460
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,240
鎖定英吋

461
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:01,000
- 那是什麼報警器 - 那是什麼噪音

462
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,940
- 大量的火災報警器的。 - 這是伯恩。

463
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,790
-  1：08：04.94。

464
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,520
- 我看不到你，你不能保護我。 - 我需要你留下你在哪裡，史密斯。

465
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:33,010
我們仍然對我的側面。

466
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,880
我對他。

467
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,310
你能看見我在人群中

468
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,280
留你在哪裡，史密斯。

469
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,470
你知道他為什麼在這裡。他想要的地址。

470
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:47,840
我們已經失去了信號。我得離開這裡。

471
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,640
- 這到底是怎麼回事 - 伯恩的得到史密斯。

472
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,060
跟著他們去。我都會和你在一起，並提出他們。

473
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:38,940
史密斯先生，我知道你和伯恩。找到一種方法，讓我們知道你在哪裡。

474
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,740
- 為什麼你要帶我這裡 - 第五大道，在廣場。

475
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,900
- 別緊張。賈森 - 韋伯..

476
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,260
-  1：09：58.90，貝魯特。

477
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,820
他是我的父親，他開始紋石。

478
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,050
他雇了你把我下survellaince。為什麼呢，他為什麼要僱用你

479
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,630
或者說，你覺得。

480
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,800
- 你要什麼我們做什麼 - 工作，你一路下跌到運河。

481
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,960
我圈住，並在那裡等你。

482
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:33,200
你跟著我的貝魯特。我最後一次見到我的父親。

483
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,380
他為什麼會對你跟著我

484
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,580
它沒有任何意義，為什麼

485
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,830
別給他一個該死的東西。

486
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,740
為什麼

487
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,500
-  1：10：41.74。

488
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,620
我能聽出來。

489
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:00,300
我去那裡告訴你，紋石曾找過我。

490
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,290
但如果是，為什麼他不說什麼。

491
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,860
我做了什麼。

492
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,020
東西..

493
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,700
這是有代價的。

494
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,850
這是他被殺害的那一天。

495
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,320
他們說，他是被恐怖分子殺害。

496
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,210
他沒有被恐怖分子殺害，是他

497
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,910
想想你的家人的安全，史密斯。並閉上你的嘴。

498
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,990
巢子彈在你的頭上。

499
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,090
為什麼他殺死

500
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,000
為什麼

501
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,670
耶穌，只是因為你。

502
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,660
你的父親，他是不是在操作。

503
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,200
他並沒有真的選擇你，但是當他發現了

504
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,000
他威脅要揭露程序。

505
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,570
他不想讓你變成一個殺手。

506
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,010
誰殺了他

507
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,730
- 誰殺了他 - 不這樣做。

508
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,840
他在哪裡

509
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:17,010
他幾乎沒有。

510
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,620
我們現在要阻止這一切。

511
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,150
他去了屋頂。想跑。 。

512
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,150
他認出了我。

513
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,410
我必須確保它的完成。 。

514
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,280
靠邊請靠邊站。

515
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,210
- 他走了。 - 媽的。 - 我追捕他。

516
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,250
我要工作，我的話了運河。

517
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,630
不可以，你在倫敦大功告成。

518
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:28,210
- 你在說什麼 - 還有另外一個地方。

519
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,110
現在他知道。

520
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,440
-  1：13：23.240，機會別的東西。

521
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,650
- 這不是報復。 - 是的。

522
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,060
而且它不會做，直到我們中的一個已經死了。

523
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,070
到達機場。

524
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,350
我們有IronHand一個問題。

525
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,980
收到。

526
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:59,260
- 給我一個SITREP。形勢報告 - 我們沒什麼。

527
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,730
繼續尋找。

528
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,130
駕駛。

529
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,160
它不應該去這樣，我想談談。 - 哪裡去杜威

530
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:25,630
他去拉斯維加斯與亞倫Kalloor說話簽署。

531
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,860
慣例。該機構每年招收那裡。

532
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:31,090
什麼是鐵手

533
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,480
杜威的新黑色行動計劃。

534
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:38,260
全sprectrum監視。

535
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,290
每個人，所有的時間。

536
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,960
杜威需要Kalloor的合作，為在線

537
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,290
讓我出去。

538
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,240
我可以幫你到達那裡。

539
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,610
為什麼要這麼做

540
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:00,310
你和我有不同的原因，但我們都希望。

541
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:06,650
在這裡，借此。

542
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,250
我會看到你在拉斯維加斯。

543
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:40,290
拉斯維加斯，內華達州

544
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,340
我們正在Shahadi的射手在修復越來越接近命中

545
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,480
-  1：15：51.34。

546
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:57,370
我們建立銀行賬戶，旅行證件，電子郵件，通話記錄。

547
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,320
- 它會像一匹孤獨的狼。 - 任何實物證據

548
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:03,370
槍，並擦上它他的指紋。

549
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:07,240
羅素並不需要瞭解這一點。 （導演埃德溫NI羅素??）

550
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,370
我明白了，先生。

551
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,660
在伯恩的任何消息。

552
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,420
沒有。

553
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,190
他總是要來給我。

554
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,720
好吧，如果它發生，我們會處理。

555
01:16:30,230 --> 01:16:32,160
牙膏和洗髮水的小警察。

556
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:03,920
-  1：17：00.16，邁克爾斯先生。

557
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,210
商業。

558
01:17:31,540 --> 01:17:35,740
- 歡迎回家，先生。 - 謝謝，

559
01:17:57,100 --> 01:17:59,340
主席先生，我們對你有一個安全的房間，樓上說得對。

560
01:18:59,990 --> 01:19:02,030
- 入住愉快。 - 謝謝。

561
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:04,760
嗨，歡迎選舉事務處世博會。

562
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,990
- 我已經安排入住。 - 好的。

563
01:19:13,160 --> 01:19:16,230
我們有你在美麗的天空套房，沒有2016年。

564
01:19:16,930 --> 01:19:19,270
- 入住愉快。 - 謝謝。

565
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:50,990
- 尋找李某，告訴她我要見她，我們去之前upstairs.-是的，先生。

566
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,340
我會需要男人貼backstate以及禮堂。

567
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,580
董事要見你。

568
01:20:58,730 --> 01:21:02,440
- 你們都設置 - 現在檢查離場航線。

569
01:21:02,500 --> 01:21:06,180
- 你沒有太多的時間。 - 他們不會知道它是從哪裡來的。

570
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,510
我有足夠的時間。

571
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:12,400
你照顧Kalloor後，我會站在旁邊的左手，

572
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,600
你把子彈在他看來，這是更好，也禮堂。

573
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:17,720
收到。

574
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,190
李處長要和你談一談，樓上。

575
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:05,500
當然。

576
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:44,820
左邊的口袋杜威

577
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:59,550
希瑟，來到這裡。我給你的，

578
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:00,970
強有力的支持者，

579
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,430
這就是為什麼我不知道你怎麼做。我想我可以只啊，

580
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,530
把它註銷掉你..學習曲線。

581
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:12,690
我很感激??。

582
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:16,300
我至少你現在可以看到你沒有。

583
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,300
或Bourne。

584
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,820
我會對付他，你明白

585
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,720
當然。我完全同意。

586
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,870
當你在舞台上。

587
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,610
- 我會準備好的，先生。 - 好吧，讓我們做到這一點。

588
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:06,950
- 亞倫。 - 羅伯特。

589
01:24:08,020 --> 01:24:09,600
你從來沒有遇到過。

590
01:24:14,290 --> 01:24:16,450
是啊，我們...我們去斯坦福在一起。

591
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:21,940
- 你是如何在原子能機構享受生活 - 具有挑戰性，但充實。

592
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,670
，依然是你那邊的興趣

593
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,820
我的原則是蠻好，謝謝。

594
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:32,850
先生們，我們已經準備好為您服務。請跟我來。

595
01:24:33,220 --> 01:24:35,680
- 我要享受這一點。 - 我也是。

596
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:15,400
啊，你好。怎麼樣大家今晚做

597
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:17,360
歡迎。

598
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,760
歡迎光臨今晚的EXOCON研討會。

599
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:31,010
我們很幸運，有四個奇妙今晚的客人。

600
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,470
美國中央情報局局長羅伯特・杜威

601
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:40,580
我的親愛的朋友，和EXOCON的老朋友，

602
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:45,030
CEO的社交媒體巨頭DEEP夢想，亞倫Kalloor就在這裡。

603
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:26,150
，人身權VS公共安全。

604
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,490
這是我們這個時代的大問題。

605
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,920
我們做出這個選擇將決定我們的未來。

606
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:34,770
所以我們就立刻開始，好嗎

607
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,570
來吧，夥計們！

608
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,640
先生，您有來電的消息。

609
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,450
- 高優先級。

610
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,340
好的傢伙，我將不得不採取此。

611
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,070
-  1：26：45.34。

612
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:11,630
看來導演杜威安頓下來瞬間，我的意思

613
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,900
有人告訴我，這不應該再過多，

614
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:18,040
但是，我們有一噸的東西進入今晚，所以我要去反正開始。

615
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,770
克雷格，我可以說幾句話

616
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,950
- 對不起 - 我能得到正常

617
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,440
哦，當然男人。通過一切手段。女士們，先生們，亞倫Kalloor。

618
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:38,790
謝謝，非常感謝。

619
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:49,420
主任出來之前加入我們，我只

620
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,580
只是想與你們分享幾句話。

621
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,300
很久以前，我，我有這個想法。

622
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:56,080
收到。

623
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:59,950
面部識別有一個擊中

624
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,390
他在拉斯維加斯就像兩個小時前。

625
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,230
-  1：28：02.39

626
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,660
有人發表了他的護照原子能機構的安全檢查。

627
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:16,670
...從不要蜘蛛世界的人使用我們的服務開始，

628
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:27,280
什麼是錯的

629
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:37,010
來吧住宿，照顧Kalloor的，和那個女孩。

630
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,690
複製。

631
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,690
我想說的是，你知道，

632
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,950
所有這一切的成功是有代價的，

633
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,200
有癌症的心臟

634
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:47,740
DEEP夢想，

635
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:50,060
一個罪惡的秘密，

636
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:52,740
現在啊，現在我要分享

637
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:54,160
所有你們的，所以

638
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:57,320
只要有採取。現在取出Kalloor和那個女孩。

639
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,370
我，拿錢去啊，開始我的公司

640
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:16,160
並提出用在深??色西裝的傢伙討價還價。

641
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:21,550
而現在，他回來拿我的靈魂。

642
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,530
主席先生，我們得走了。

643
01:29:58,520 --> 01:30:01,940
拿到車準備好了。拿到車準備好了，現在！

644
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,400
號帶我到浴室。

645
01:30:03,420 --> 01:30:05,880
主席先生，我們必須讓你離開這裡。伯恩是鬆散的。

646
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,860
- 你聽說過我。帶我去浴室。 - 是的先生。

647
01:30:10,110 --> 01:30:12,390
走上套件。就拿他上樓。

648
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,780
找他上樓。現在，就是現在。

649
01:30:14,850 --> 01:30:16,540
到套件。

650
01:30:36,520 --> 01:30:40,280
巴斯克斯，SITREP。形勢報告。巴斯克斯。巴斯克斯，進來了。

651
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:43,880
嘿!

652
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:05,820
好吧，我們得到了他，先生。我們已經ID'd狙擊手。

653
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,400
- 媽的！ - 我們現在流傳他的照片。

654
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,850
- 什麼伯恩 - 等一下。

655
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,450
好吧，伯恩剛剛離開西邊樓梯走廊大廳標題。

656
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:17,280
收到。留在伯恩。

657
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:24,310
- 霍頓。 - 我們仍然在尋找伯恩。他們已經ID'd的IAD資產。

658
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,700
回到一樓，並等待進一步的instructions.-是的，先生，請複製。

659
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,320
停在那兒。放下它。

660
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,920
移動，移動，移動。

661
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:35,790
到東北部電梯，現在。

662
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,170
伯恩是在他的途中給你。

663
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,920
你花了很長時間才到達這裡，賈森。

664
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,180
我知道貝魯特。

665
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:42,520
我知道你做了什麼。

666
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,660
這一切都在今晚結束。

667
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:48,600
它會做，如果馬上輕鬆了許多。

668
01:33:56,610 --> 01:34:00,000
你沒來這裡進行報復。你來了，因為這時候進來了。

669
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:13,430
你父親創建的程序。沒有什麼需要，使其工作。

670
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:15,320
而你沒有。

671
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,600
你總是那樣。

672
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:24,320
- 這就是為什麼你主動請纓。 - 我自告奮勇，因為我認為恐怖分子殺害樓。

673
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,270
- 我自告奮勇，因為一個謊言。 - 不可以，你自告奮勇becasue你是誰的。

674
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,350
你自告奮勇因為你是傑森・伯恩。

675
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:35,590
而且，不，大衛・韋伯。

676
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,400
32殺死，賈森。

677
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,490
所有的人在這個國家，

678
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:53,800
是因為你做了什麼更安全。

679
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,860
-  1：34：53.80。

680
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,390
我試圖找到另一種方式。

681
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:13,360
怎麼這麼努力為你

682
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,720
你沒有任何和平。

683
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,940
不，直到你承認你自己，誰你真的是。

684
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,370
據這裡的猝死，賈森。

685
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:35,510
停止這樣做。

686
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:42,990
- 所以 - 我不能。

687
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,440
不適合你。

688
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:26,960
你從來沒有在這裡。

689
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:36,410
你不必走路。

690
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,280
現在，這可以停止。

691
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,700
你有一個選擇。

692
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:12,690
各單位，犯罪嫌疑人偷了2015年的黑色道奇Charger。

693
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,440
這是空單，被告知，嫌疑人車輛墜毀

694
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:43,580
在裡維埃拉的東南入口。

695
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,340
我們未知嫌疑人在前往裡維埃拉的暴漏。

696
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,640
你是個叛徒。你一直是個叛徒。

697
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,150
-  1：45：50.64。

698
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:35,920
與當局合作，以找出誰負責。

699
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:39,200
-  1：47：35.92。

700
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:40,860
謝謝。

701
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:15,120
先生。

702
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:26,890
我想說我很抱歉，先生。

703
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:28,830
關於拉斯維加斯。

704
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:32,880
我讀了杜威的策略是..不明智的。

705
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:34,180
失策。

706
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:38,700
我們還在試圖想出一個故事，解釋發生了什麼。

707
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:42,440
兒子的一婊子那把聚光燈在我們頭上。

708
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,790
我們所有人。

709
01:48:45,110 --> 01:48:46,940
-  1：48：44.79呢。

710
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,840
我認識她。

711
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:53,260
還是有動作，我們可以做到的。

712
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:57,270
告訴我。

713
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,160
杜威的問題是，他抱著對過去。

714
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:05,120
人是祖國的未來。

715
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,140
這些都是我的人。

716
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:09,800
我知道該怎麼做了。

717
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,040
你想要什麼

718
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,550
當你指定的機構負責人，你會需要一個人，

719
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:21,650
工作。

720
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:23,590
有人...

721
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,960
一小時， 。

722
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,050
由你，

723
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:29,770
-  1：49：28.05-。

724
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,290
什麼伯恩

725
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:35,260
你還認為你可以帶他在

726
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,740
我有他的信任。

727
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:42,270
畢竟我們經歷過。

728
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,290
我會帶他進來。

729
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:47,280
我敢肯定它。

730
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,920
如果你不能什麼

731
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,010
然後 ..

732
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:56,830
他不得不放下。

733
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,190
這是一個有趣的建議。

734
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,400
你可以在這裡拉過來。

735
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:16,640
當然，如果你決定，你不需要我，

736
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:18,910
這不是一個問題。

737
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,010
有跡象表明，要什麼我知道很多其他機構。

738
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,280
我給你帶來了什麼。

739
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:02,510
這是一個從你父親的明星鑄造，在紀念牆。

740
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,320
我對你怎麼樣了遺憾。

741
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,630
一世 。誰這樣做的人，都沒有了。

742
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,300
和，

743
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:26,040
事情正在發生變化的局。

744
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,270
什麼是你想要

745
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:33,200
我知道你一直是一個愛國者。

746
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:37,300
會發生什麼，對這個國家，對您有價值。

747
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:41,040
我們需要您幫助我們保護它。

748
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:43,620
快來回。

749
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,560
我們會一起努力。

750
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,970
讓我想一想。

751
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,070
我怎麼能找到你。

752
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:48,230
你還認為你可以帶他在

753
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:49,920
我有他的信任。

754
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:52,810
畢竟我們經歷過。

755
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,920
我會帶他進來。

756
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:57,280
我敢肯定它。

757
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,520
如果你不能

758
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,380
然後，

759
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:04,900
他不得不放下。

760
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:14,960
我並不感到驚訝，TMD！

1
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,050
I remember,

2
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,110
I remember everything.

3
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,810
Captain Webb, are you .

4
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,570
Good morning.. good morning

5
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,240
Yes, sir.

6
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:51,640
When we are finished with you, 
you will no longer be David Webb.

7
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,260
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

8
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:58,640
You can't say .

9
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,180
-   

10
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,790
01:01:.18-   

11
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,800
Eventually you're gonna 
have to face the fact

12
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:16,900
you chose right here 
to become Jason Bourne.

13
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:07,600
TSAMANTAS, GREECE 
On the Greek-Albanian border.

14
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,560
Vasily, you're up first.

15
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,880
10 on the Serbian!

16
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,000
20 on the Serb!

17
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,200
10 on the Russian!

18
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:41,480
REYKJAVIK, ICELAND

19
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,910
Christian Dassault made a reservation.

20
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,320
Use SQL to  corrupt their databases...

21
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,670
CIA: CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
LANGLEY, Virginia

22
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:50,240
NEWSPAPER: 
Loss of confidence in the CIA.

23
00:05:08,450 --> 00:05:09,770
Hello, Nate

24
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:09,860
Regarding your device,
issued to an agent  

25
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:15,130
assigned to their first project in 1993.

26
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,910
Marked  on our Inventory as destroyed.

27
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,080
It's knocking on our front door.

28
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,990
It's knocking on our front door.

29
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,530
Downloading "BLACK OPERATIONS" 
folder to: USB Drive.

30
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,320
- What's the status 
- Whoever it is, is just sitting there, idle.

31
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,760
Move.

32
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,720
- SYSTEM BREACH 
- They found a back-door.

33
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,420
- We need a reverse shell  
- I'm not clocking at the source.

34
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,820
Okay, we have a major breach
of our classified main-frame.

35
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,300
Drop everything you're doing 
and get on it, right now.

36
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,180
- We're sending you the shell. 
- Got it.

37
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,980
- Oompa loompa camp   
- Cut the power to the building.

38
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,160
- Get into that power grid, now.

We've just been hacked.

- How badly 
- Could be worse than Snowden.

- Is there any attribution
- We're working on it.

49

Police say it must be someone with 
a deep knowledge of our systems.

50
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,840
This could affect Rio Olympics  
and Iron Hand.

I want a briefing.

- According to the reports 
- Yes.

56
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:41,330
- Did you get confirmation 
- Yeah, it was a hack.

57
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,870
- So are we exposed 
- We don't know yet. We're checking.

58
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,570
George, are we ready for launch

59
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:03,120
Helen, you know the Dir of National Intelligence. 
( Director NI Edwin Russell )

60
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:05,780
I believe   , sir.

61
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,970
Have you got a name for us

62
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,930
Our hacker was a former Agency operative.

63
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,510
Believed to be working with
Christian Dassault,  and ...

64
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:16,840
previously linked to ... Jason Bourne.

65

Bourne

IronHand

69
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:31,880
That's not even operational yet, 
for Christ's sakes.

70
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,760
Where is Nicky Parsons right now

71
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,180
On the move.

72
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,820
She left    traveling with a group of

73
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,460
Feels like a meeting to me.

74
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,690
How are you going to handle it

75
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,100
We cut the head off this thing.

76
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,630
Sir. I'd like to be point
on this operation.

77
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,140
- You're not indoctrinated for this material. 
- I'm already into it.

78
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:10,800
I embedded malware into Parsons' download.  
When those files are opened, I can trace them.

79
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,070
I'd be in.

80
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,120
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,

81
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:20,070
And if he's out there,
I'll give you Bourne, too.

82
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,460
I appreciate you enthusiasm.

83
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,090
but,

84
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,120
- Do not push your personal agenda, to the DEI again. 
- Understood.

85
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,160
Alright, I think you can help me.

86
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,670
I'm going to give you full 
operational control on this.

87
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,680
And I'll assure that you have 
acces to any relevant teams

88
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:58,600
and resources. And I want to 
know every move you make.

89
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:02,310
Yes, sir. 
Thank you very much sir.

ROME, ITALY

91
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,390
- Yeah. 
- I need your help now.

92
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,700
I'm not finished here.

93
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,200
Jason Bourne is in play.

94
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,740

- Athens, closer to Carmen  , Rome.

SYNTAGMA SQUARE KIOSK 
 1 hour.

98
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:02,570
We got a hit from a CC TV feed , 
Parsons boarded a bus half-hour ago.

99
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:05,160
west across Athens. 
I got two local teams en route.

100
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,400
- Any sign of Bourne 
- Not so far.

101
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,270
He's involved in this somehow, 
I can feel it.

102
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:15,010
- 16:14.960-   .

103
00:16:15,090 --> 00:16:17,010
- 16:15.01   .

104
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,010
Copy that.

105
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,360
Where are we

106
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:25,040
Carson's assett has just
arrived at Syntayma Square.

107
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,920
There's a demonstration in front 
of the Natalia building.

108
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,690
I think she will use it as cover.

109
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:32,170
Before   at the square,

110
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:37,370
We come in for Parsons, pair up at Parliament, 
and any possible run-in with Bourne.

111
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:40,390
Copy that, sir. 
Sir, the asset has landed.

112
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:16,380
- Alpha Team arriving now. 
- Copy that.

113
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,740
- I have the Alpha Team feed. 
- Pull them up.

114
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:17,400
Athens police is reporting tactical
teams moving on the demonstrators.

115
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:21,050
- Isolate all social media posts from the Square.
- Yes, ma'am.

116
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,840
- Rewind Alpha One's feed.
- Yes, ma'am. Twenty seconds.

117
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,750
- What's wrong 
- I hacked the Agency.

118
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,640
- 19:11.75 .

119
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,870
I hacked all the black ops files, 
including the Armani.  

120
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,420
Who you doing this for

121
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,640
Stop.

122
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:27,370
Two seconds more. Long hair.

123
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,120
Enhance.

124
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,110
Find her.

125
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:50,140
- I told you, Dassault is going to get you killed. 
- We don't have a choice, Jason.

126
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:54,350
They started again, a new program, 
Iron Hand. It's even worse than before.

127
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,220
- What's that got to do with me 
- Because it matters.  It matters.

128
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,520
To me, it doesn't.

129
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,210
All that matters is staying alive. 
You get off the grid, survive.

130
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,250
I don't believe that,
and neither do you.

131
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,150
Look at yourself.

132
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:10,150
Look at what you're doing.

133
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,700
You can't live like
this for much longer.

134
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,970
Jason, I came here
because I found something.

135
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,530
I found you father's
 Treadstone files.

136
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,570
He was an analyst.
He wasn't in operations.

137
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,340
- He wasn't near any of that stuff. 
- I'm telling you what I saw.

138
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,780
It looks like he was involved directly.

139
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,840
- And there's more. More about you. 
- What do you mean

140
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,660
Before you joined the program, 
they were watching you.

141
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,970
Watching me

142
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:42,650
You tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

143
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:48,250
And you don't know the truth 
about what they did to you.

144
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,120
You need to read those files.

145
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,430
Move

146
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:05,610
Number One has eyes on two targets.  
One female, one male.

147
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:05,740
- Identify the male. 
- Copy that.

148
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,940
- Identify the male. 
- Copy that.

149
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,870
You gotta get out of here before
they  this part of the city.

150
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:21,320
Head north.

151
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:24,090
Meet me at the statue of Athena.

152
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,900
- I'll take them away from you. 
- Hey, stop!

153
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,930
That's him.

154
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,310
Now.

155
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,270
  Bourne. .

156
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,250
- Cleared to engage the target. 
- Copy.

157
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,900
Sir, Alpha Team's comms are down.

158
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:56,140
We've lost Support Team No. 3  

159
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,790
- 22:55.880   .

160
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,900
- 22:58.790   

161
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:03,300
Sir, rioting is starting to break out and 
Athens' declaring State of Emergency.

162
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,990
We got her.

163
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,740
Second team put her in a box.

164
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:38,170
Suspect last reported seen on a police 
motorcycle. He's heading north.

165
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,300
- Where the hell is the asset 
- Two minutes out, sir.

166
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,760
- Carson is at the statue of Athena. 
- Copy that.

167
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,170
-  Team is down. 
- Sir, the asset is arriving on scene.

168
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,840
Philip the gosh down, give 
me direct comm to the Asset.

169
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,050
- 26:57.720 .

170
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:15,400
- I need eyes overhead. 
- Remit the satellite's feed.

171
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,330
They're actually .
Twelve satellites available.

172
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,620
- 27:20.320  . 
- Yes, sir.

173
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,040
The   feed is online.

174
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:42,530
- 27:38.40   barrier. 
- The target is  will be forced to turn left.

175
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:59,270
Another barricade at 200 meters. 
Target turning left.

176
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,750
Bourne is heading for the alley. 
Left at top of the hill.

177
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:51,710
Here, got out. Where is he going

178
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,620
Found a way out. 200 meters
to your left. 19 Salomon.

179
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:59,960
Get to the roof.  Bourne 
will pass by your line-of-sight.

180
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
I see soldiers coming.

181
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,150
- 29:12.000  .

182
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,000
- 29:12.2000  . 
- Copy that.

183
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:45,080
Approaching the targets
at Harmonien and 50th.

184
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:48,140
- 29:47.040  .

185
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,240
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

186
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,050

188

Targets with you within 15 seconds.

189
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,830
5 seconds.

190
00:30:49,430 --> 00:30:51,800
- Contact. 
Stay low!

191
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,020
One shot.

192
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,650
Hold on.

193
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:40,950
Where's Bourne

194
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:44,240
Police at the top have spotted three bodies 
on the roof that the asset attacked.

195
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,680
Team's on it's way.

196
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,740
Nicky.

197
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:10,570
Don't move.

198
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:22,110
The tactical team has entered the building.

199
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:26,320
- Asset, you need to get out of there. 
- Negative

200
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,450
We don't even know
if Bourne is still alive.

201
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,840
So  is gone.

202
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:42,030
This is Director Dewey, 27 is gone.

203
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,800
Hold on, Nicky.

204
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,980
I'm going to get you to cover.

205
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,600
Don't, no ..

206
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:09,770
I'm coming..

207
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,550
Location was from this office, sir.

208
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,130
If he was working with Nikky Parsons, 
he will have suggested Bourne.

209
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:16,150
And let me know if you
get a hit on that malware.

210
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:18,050
Sir, can I clarify one thing.

211
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,300
- 34:20.040   

212
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,800
Plus he has to think Bourne.

213
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,170
- 34:22.280  

214
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,410
His behavior or will-power

215
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,970
And suggests a connectioin.

216
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:35,260
The last time Bourne came back he 
exposed the Black Briar program.

217
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,780
He compromised accurate operations.

218
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,620
And the assets in Syria, under cover.

219
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:47,110
He was captured, and tortured. And
took near a damn year to get him out.

220
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:53,060
So you think that's why Bourne 
wanted the files. To go public again

221
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,910
I have no idea why he came back.

222
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:57,030
But whatever he's doing, 
he wants to destroy us.

223
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,860
I can't let that happen.

224
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,320
So please give me a call, 
soon as you hear anything.

225
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:05,800
Yes, sir.

226
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:58,490
- Treadstone  >>>  IronHand
- Richard Webb Involved. JB Under surveillance.

227
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,210
And now the founder and chairman 
of DEEP DREAM .. Aaron Kalloor.

228
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,840
Ahh, you know why you're here. 
We will be unveiling a new platform.

229
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:20,040
We think it is a bold new step, to
allow us to serve our community better.

230
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:23,880
We're turning in right now to 
trascend national boundaries, and

231
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:26,650
I think we're at 1.5 Billion users.

232
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:40,080
You know we have an ecosystem of hundreds 
of thousands of apps at this point.

233
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:43,970
And what this new platform
will do is integrate

234
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:46,220
User's data and preferences,

235
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,110
And use that information, 
to enrich and tailor-make

236
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,350
Each unique user experience, 
in a way that is frankly

237
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,720
Unprecedented.

238
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:59,330
Now, I can see some journalists' brains 
twitching, ready to ask about privacy.

239
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,420
This is a concern of many
people, and so it should be.

240
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,870
This is something that matters 
to us, and let me just say

241
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:09,120
I understand, nobody wants to feel 
like they're being watched

242
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,860
So let just tell you, when you come to 
DEEP DREAM, when you use our service.

243
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,150
No-one will be watching you.

244
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,810
- Enjoy your meal 
- Thank you.

245
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,340
Congratulations,

246
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,040
I hear you stock-holders were very 
happy with the new platform.

247
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,110
And I heard you got hacked.

248
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,310
You were  .

249
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:01,800
This changes everything. 
There's too much risk.

250
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:04,770
- I'm out. 
- Hey,

251
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,460
You are an extra-ordinarily gifted 
and perceptive young man.

252
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,600
And you agreed to help us it's because 
you understood the very grave threats,

253
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:26,690
Do you have idea the shit-storm on our 
hands if this arrangement goes public

254
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,960
I agreed to it, and you were more ..

255
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,530
Our enemies have become 
much more sophisticated.

256
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,090
Gathering meta-data is
no longer adequate.

257
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,950
We need a back-door into
your new platform, in a way

258
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:42,770
- 40:28.680  . 
- When that's not enough, you want something new.

259
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,920
You .. you don't get it, do you

260
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,830
Privacy is,, is, freedom.

261
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,760
I believe that's something you 
should think about defending.

262
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,560
You little prick, you didn't believe 
in privacy or freedom when

263
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,680
When you started. 
I've turned you into a billionaire.

264
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:59,470
I have paid you back many,
many, many times over.

265
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,370
And I was not comfortable
with any of this.  I'm out.

266
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,730
- I'm done selling out our customers. 
- Yet you would sell out your country.

267
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:14,050
The truth is, we would't be having 
this conversation if you didn't feel

268
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,080
Personally at risk.

269
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,430
You talk about a free internet, you tell 
yourself you're saving the world,

270
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:23,480
All you're doing is making it a much more 
dangerous place. And you sure as hell

271
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,600
Making this country much
more difficult to defend.

272
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:30,650
And you're sure as
hell accountable for that.

273
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:45,370
BERLIN, GERMANY

274
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:58,550
Oi, everything on the table.

275
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:16,580
Open it.

276
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,280
Sure.

277
00:44:57,290 --> 00:44:58,920
Bourne's surfaced.

278
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:00,480
- In Berlin.

279
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,260
Get the Berlin team out.

280
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,680
- Where is she 
- She is dead.

281
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,800
She knew the risks. I owed her.

282
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:29,000
She made her choice.

283
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,080
You exploited her.

284
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:51,780
- Blue Team is mobile. 
- Who do we have in the location

285
00:45:51,940 --> 00:45:54,950
- We can try to find Christian Dassault . 
- Can we put a bit more

286
00:45:54,950 --> 00:45:58,650
Not on the app. I'm activating CC TV now.

287
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,370
So I've been thinking,

288
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,400
What if we go this wrong

289
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,030
What if they still come for us

290
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:08,700
What if it's something else

291
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:12,760
You don't have any idea
of who you're dealing with.

292
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,020
We should work together more.

293
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,990
We both have the same thing right.

294
00:46:29,790 --> 00:46:32,200
You expose the .

295
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:37,170
We both want to take down
the  that control society.

296
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:40,670
I'm not on your side.

297
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,700
CC TV is online.

298
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:06,600
- He's on a computer. 
- Yes,

299
00:47:07,330 --> 00:47:09,060
He puts those files online,

300
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,540
Operations will be compromised, 
 and people will die.

301
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,720
Yes, sir.

302
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:20,300
Is this what you've
done for your files

303
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,730
These programs have
to be exposed. 

304
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,960
Be glad I know you well.

305
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,960
TREADSTONE PROGRAM
A proposal by Richard Web

306
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,830
We need that computer.

307
00:47:50,950 --> 00:47:52,350
- Hasn't found the malware.

308
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:55,110
I can use it to delete the files.

309
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,200
REMOTE STATUS -  ACCESS CONFIRMED 
LINK COMPLETE.

310
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:24,690
- Where's that team 
- Five minutes out, sir.

311
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:12,720
Listen to me Dave, I've done something.

312
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,790
Something,

313
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,450
It came with a cost.

314
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,520
One day, you'll understand why.

315
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,940
I got to get back to Washington.

316
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,100
I love you, son.

317
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:22,230
They're fighting, sir.

318
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:35,960
One more firewall.

319
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:00,630
Files deleted, sir.

320
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:03,940
Call it.

321
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:41,880
Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.

322
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,130
I'm not in charge here.

323
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,460
I wasn't here when you were missing.

324
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:51,610
I can see you're going through
the old Treadstone files.

325
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:54,780
Are you tracing you history

326
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:57,960
I know you're looking for something.

327
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,850
Let me know if you find it.

328
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:08,780
Give me that phone.

329
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,760
Yes, sir.

330
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:20,200
Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me

331
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:23,990
- Jason, your Dad was a patriot.

332
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,640
He could see the threats
facing Americans in .

333
00:52:28,370 --> 00:52:30,490
Chose to serve his country across

334
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,750
Balance it, Eddie.

335
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:34,900
Giving up

336
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,960
But to see you on the Agency.

337
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,560
- 52:34 .

338
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,810
I'm here to stop it now.

339
00:52:57,150 --> 00:53:01,150
TEAM ARRIVING. 
You HAVE 2 MINUTES.

340
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,750
We lost him, sir.

341
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,300
Malcom Smith, contract-only, 
based out of London

342
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:43,660
Ran all of Tradestone's surveillance in
the late 90's, when Bourne was recruited.

343
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:46,450
- Is he still active 
- He's private security now.

344
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:50,200
Contact the asset and tell him who we
want drowned and murderd in 6 hours.

345
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:52,070
I'd be ... in Stickson.

346
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,030
He'd sick, won't he

347
00:54:57,080 --> 00:55:00,220
The'res  for catching Bourne. 
Instead of killing him.

348
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,390
Alright, let's hear it.

349
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:05,710
Bourne's been off the
grid for a long time.

350
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:09,260
He's been hiding in the shadows. 
He's seen things.

351
00:55:09,310 --> 00:55:11,490
He knows things that could help us.

352
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:14,290
Bring him back in, is the smart move.

353
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,190
And how are we going to do that

354
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,340
I'll  and Bourne with the program.

355
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,040
He concluded Bourne is
still a patriot at heart.

356
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:25,160
Put me back into the program, and .

357
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:31,680
- And where do you suggest that 
- I'll watch Bourne .

358
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,620
Desperately, but our
intests passed, and ...

359
00:55:35,730 --> 00:55:37,930
I can be sort a tech .

360
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,190
If I can get face to face with him.

361
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,550
I think I can bring him back in.

362
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:46,250
One time.  And if it fails ..

363
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,360
You don't have to ..

364
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:55,270
Well, it makes sense to me. 
What do you think, Bob

365
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:59,010
Let's give it a shot.

366
00:55:59,470 --> 00:56:00,970
Alright, do it.

367
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,770
Bring Bourne in,

368
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,110
We'll tie it off.

369
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,640
- This ends now. 
- Thank you, sir.

370
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,040
- Sir, I'm sorry. 
- No, no, don't.

371
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:25,200
Better get some sleep, kid.

372
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:29,230
You don't want 24-hours
without looking.

373
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:33,680
Yes, sir.

374
00:56:48,220 --> 00:56:51,250
It's taking too long, it still shouldn't
be this buggy this close to launch.

375
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,190
Would be so buggy if
James hadn't taken out .

376
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,790
- It's the parametes, it's going to have to go. 
- Okay, then we'll have to change it back.

377
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,290
- Pull the car up 
- Absolutely.

378
00:57:01,530 --> 00:57:03,920
I just don't think we
want the entire piece.

379
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,610
Mr. Kalloor,

380
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,150
Mr. Kalloor, I'm from
the Dept of Justice.

381
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:17,940
- I'm hereby serving you with the enclosed claim, 
- Really, you have to do this in public

382
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:20,950
And the Deep Dream Corporation,
for violation of the Sherman Act.

383
00:57:21,330 --> 00:57:25,300
This claim requires you to preserve all 
corporate and personal financial records.

384
00:57:25,370 --> 00:57:28,450
Pending an osmosis to be
filed in Federal Court.

385
00:57:28,730 --> 00:57:29,850
Good day.

386
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:44,670
- This is Dewey. 
- Aaron, it's a message.

387
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,080
And maybe we should think about what 
we're doing before it gets any worse.

388
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,850
So, you think if we give him 
what he wants, it will end there.

389
00:57:51,590 --> 00:57:54,270
I'm just saying that
maybe we should listen.

390
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,160
I want you to pull up all the records 
of all the meetings Paul had with me.

391
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:00,980
All the records

392
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,430
- Even the off-the-books discussions 
- Especially, those.

393
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,730
I'm going to Vegas,
I need an insurance policy.

394
00:59:31,690 --> 00:59:36,330
- Yeah. 
- Are you in London- Yes.

395
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,810
Who're you sending now

396
00:59:39,570 --> 00:59:41,250
She serves a purpose.

397
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,040
- I work alone. 
- Not this time.

398
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,780
Don't make this personal.

399
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,360
Bourne betrayed us. 
It's always been personal.

400
00:59:52,780 --> 00:59:54,820
  when you're ready.

401
01:00:04,370 --> 01:00:07,330
-Yeah 
- I need an assurance.

402
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,040
That I have your support.

403
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,290
, what do you have

404
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,030
Kalloor,

405
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,360
is planning something, 
for Vegas.

406
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,000
LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM

407
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:07,220
- Yes 
- This is Jason Bourne.

408
01:01:07,380 --> 01:01:11,450
- I need to talk. 
- What about

409
01:01:11,610 --> 01:01:15,980
- I don't work for the Agency anymore. 
- Aubrey Plaza , 15 minutes.

410
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:47,400
Bourne just called Smith.

411
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:50,920
They're meeting at Aubrey Plaza,
15 minutes.

412
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,790
- 1:01:47.720 .

413
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:56,000
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne, 
I'll approach him.

414
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,640
Whatever you say, contain him.

415
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,520
I don't want the Brits falling
all over this asking questions.

416
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:01,980
Aye, sir.

417
01:02:10,100 --> 01:02:11,610
Tracking device.

418
01:02:12,750 --> 01:02:15,110
You'll hold on the south
side of the bridge.

419
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,620
I'll contact you if I need you.

420
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,000
Sure,

421
01:02:20,450 --> 01:02:21,960
You're the boss, right

422
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,600
- Subject is on the move. 
- I can  now.

423
01:02:54,140 --> 01:02:56,310
Alpha Team take .

424
01:02:56,360 --> 01:03:00,690
Bravo Team, pull up to the subject from
behind. You keep your eyes open for Bourne.

425
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:02,960
Bravo Team, tailing subjects.

426
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:16,020
- Let's go. At 200 meters, set your mark. 
- Copy that.

427
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:24,910
Comms check, second channel. 
Do you copy

428
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:28,810
- I have you. Where are you now 
- Heading towards the .

429
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,970
No sign of Bourne.

430
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:16,140
- Subject is turning east. 
- Into an alley.

431
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:19,910
Alpha Team, that alley leads to a foot-trail, 
which will lead him to you.

432
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:21,600
Copy that.

433
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:37,060
Bravo Team is down. The second update from now.

434
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,060
Copy that, Smith

435
01:04:42,300 --> 01:04:43,400
Yes.

436
01:05:01,510 --> 01:05:04,480
Programs team, why aren't 
you moving What's going on

437
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:08,270
Programs team, do you copy

438
01:05:08,530 --> 01:05:10,730
What's happening, where is Bravo

439
01:05:11,730 --> 01:05:13,200
The comms down for Bravo.

440
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,280
Akpha Team do you have
eyes on the subject

441
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:30,480
Alpha Team, sitprep

442
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:38,620
- Alpha Team report. 
- What's happening Heather

443
01:05:39,830 --> 01:05:42,680
- Alpha Team isn't responding. 
- Bravo

444
01:05:42,930 --> 01:05:44,400
What's going on

445
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:47,860
You lost both teams  this
operation, Heather. That's Bourne.

446
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:50,080
Bring out the asset.

447
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:53,260
- Sir, I need more time. 
- We have no time.

448
01:05:53,630 --> 01:05:56,910
- Are you going to give that order or not 
- Sir, please.

449
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:01,220
If you're too naive to see the trees, 
there's no bringing in Bourne.

450
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,520
He has to be put down.

451
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:08,000
And you obviously cannot do what has to
be done. I'm taking operational control.

452
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:11,220
- 1:06:03.00 .

453
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:16,540
- , you have green light on Bourne. 
- Copy that. I'm on my way.

454
01:06:24,520 --> 01:06:26,330
Asset are you on the move

455
01:06:29,240 --> 01:06:31,880
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.

456
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:33,380
Are you moving

457
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:36,370
Heaher stay off this channel,
let him do his job.

458
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:43,590
Left here. Get up to
Aubrey Plaza, fast.

459
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:27,840
In position.

460
01:07:37,860 --> 01:07:39,240
Locked in.

461
01:07:58,290 --> 01:08:01,000
- What's that alarm 
- What's that noise

462
01:08:02,140 --> 01:08:04,940
- Lots of fire alarms. 
- That's Bourne.

463
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,790
- 1:08:04.94  .

464
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:30,520
- I can't see you, you can't protect me. 
- I need you to stay where you are, Smith.

465
01:08:31,030 --> 01:08:33,010
We still have  on the side of me.

466
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,880
I'm on him.

467
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,310
Can you see me  In the crowd

468
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,280
Stay where you are, Smith.

469
01:08:41,320 --> 01:08:44,470
You know why he's here. 
He wants the address.

470
01:08:44,530 --> 01:08:47,840
We've lost the signal. 
I got to get out of here.

471
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:08,640
- What the hell's going on 
- Bourne's got Smith.

472
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,060
Go after them.
I'll come along and come them off.

473
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:38,940
Smith, I know you're with Bourne. 
Find a way to let us know where you are.

474
01:09:42,310 --> 01:09:45,740
- Why are you taking me in here 
- 5th avenue, at the Plaza.

475
01:09:56,660 --> 01:09:58,900
- Take it easy. 
- Jason Webb ..

476
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,260
- 1:09:58.90 , Beirut.

477
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:03,820
He was my father, 
he started Treadstone.

478
01:10:03,880 --> 01:10:08,050
He hired you to put me under survellaince. 
Why, Why did he hire you

479
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:09,630
Or so you think, .

480
01:10:19,750 --> 01:10:22,800
- What do you want us to do 
- Work you way down to Canal.

481
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:24,960
I'll circle around and meet you there.

482
01:10:28,620 --> 01:10:33,200
You followed my to Beirut. 
The last time I saw my father.

483
01:10:33,420 --> 01:10:35,380
Why would he have you follow me

484
01:10:35,520 --> 01:10:37,580
It doesn't make any sense, why

485
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:39,830
Don't give him a goddamn thing.

486
01:10:40,220 --> 01:10:41,740
Why

487
01:10:50,170 --> 01:10:52,500
- 1:10:41.74 .

488
01:10:53,980 --> 01:10:55,620
I can hear that.

489
01:10:57,130 --> 01:11:00,300
I went there to tell you that 
Treadstone had approached me.

490
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:03,290
But if it was ,
why didn't he say anything.

491
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:05,860
I've done something.

492
01:11:06,920 --> 01:11:08,020
something ..

493
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,700
that came at a cost.

494
01:11:15,890 --> 01:11:17,850
That was the day he was killed.

495
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,320
They said he was killed by terrorists.

496
01:11:20,860 --> 01:11:23,210
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he

497
01:11:23,320 --> 01:11:26,910
Think about your family's safety, Smith. 
and keep your mouth shut.

498
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,990
The nest bullet is in your head.

499
01:11:29,180 --> 01:11:31,090
Why was he killed

500
01:11:31,960 --> 01:11:33,000
Why

501
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,670
Jesus, just because of you.

502
01:11:39,650 --> 01:11:42,660
Your father, 
he wasn't in operations.

503
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,200
He didn't really choose you, 
but when he found out

504
01:11:46,030 --> 01:11:48,000
He threatened to expose the program.

505
01:11:48,070 --> 01:11:50,570
He didn't want you turned into a killer.

506
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,010
Who killed him

507
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,730
- Who killed him 
- Don't do it.

508
01:12:11,950 --> 01:12:13,840
Where is he

509
01:12:15,090 --> 01:12:17,010
He's almost there.

510
01:12:20,520 --> 01:12:22,620
We're going to stop this now.

511
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:50,150
He went off the roof.
Tried to run. .

512
01:12:50,440 --> 01:12:52,150
He recognized me.

513
01:12:52,150 --> 01:12:54,410
I got to make sure it's finished. .

514
01:13:07,200 --> 01:13:09,280
Step aside please, step aside.

515
01:13:16,250 --> 01:13:19,210
- He's gone. - Oh, shit. 
- I'm going after him.

516
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:21,250
I'll work my way down the Canal.

517
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:24,630
No. You're done in London.

518
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:28,210
- What're you talking about 
- There's another place .

519
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,110
Now he knows .

520
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,440
- 1:13:23.240 , 
Opportunity for something else.

521
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:37,650
- This isn't about revenge. 
- Yes, it is.

522
01:13:37,780 --> 01:13:40,060
And it won't be done
till one of us is dead.

523
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,070
Get to the airport.

524
01:13:42,680 --> 01:13:45,350
We have a problem with IronHand.

525
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:47,980
Copy that.

526
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:59,260
- Give me a sitrep.  situation report  
- We've got nothing.

527
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:00,730
Keep looking.

528
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,130
Drive.

529
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,160
It wasn't supposed to go like this, I wanted to talk. 
- Where's Dewey going

530
01:14:22,710 --> 01:14:25,630
He's going to Vegas to speak with 
Aaron Kalloor to sign the .

531
01:14:25,670 --> 01:14:28,860
Convention. The Agency recruits there every year.

532
01:14:29,350 --> 01:14:31,090
What's Iron Hand

533
01:14:33,620 --> 01:14:35,480
Dewey's new black ops program.

534
01:14:36,050 --> 01:14:38,260
Full-sprectrum surveillance.

535
01:14:38,360 --> 01:14:40,290
 everyone, all the time.

536
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,960
Dewey needs Kalloor's
co-operation for the online

537
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,290
Let me out.

538
01:14:49,720 --> 01:14:51,240
I can help you get there.

539
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:56,610
Why would you do that

540
01:14:56,670 --> 01:15:00,310
You and I have different reasons, 
but we both want  to .

541
01:15:04,790 --> 01:15:06,650
Here, take this.

542
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:22,250
I'll see you in Vegas.

543
01:15:38,030 --> 01:15:40,290
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA

544
01:15:48,540 --> 01:15:51,340
We're getting close hit on a 
fix on Shahadi's shooter 

545
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,480
- 1:15:51.34 .

546
01:15:53,580 --> 01:15:57,370
We created bank accounts, travel 
documents, emails, phone records.

547
01:15:57,560 --> 01:16:00,320
- It'll look like a lone wolf. 
- Any physical evidence

548
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:03,370
 the gun, and rub
his fingerprints on it.

549
01:16:04,850 --> 01:16:07,240
Russell doesn't need to know about this. 
(Director NI Edwin Russell)

550
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,370
I understand sir.

551
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:13,660
Any news on Bourne. 

552
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:15,420
Nothing.

553
01:16:17,290 --> 01:16:19,190
He was always going to come for me.

554
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:23,720
Well, if it happens we'll deal with it.

before we go upstairs.- Yes, sir.

566
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:54,340
I'm going to need men posted 
backstate as well as the auditorium.

567
01:20:45,780 --> 01:20:48,580

- They won't know where it came from.

570
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,510
I'll have enough time.

571
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:12,400
After you take care of Kalloor,
I'll be standing left-hand beside,

572
01:21:12,540 --> 01:21:15,600
You put a bullet in him, it's better,
auditorium too. 

573
01:21:16,450 --> 01:21:17,720
Copy that.

574
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:03,190
Lee, the Director wants 
a word with you, upstairs.

575
01:22:04,270 --> 01:22:05,500
Of course.

576
01:22:41,140 --> 01:22:44,820
LEFT POCKET FOR DEWEY


577
01:22:56,350 --> 01:22:59,550
Heather, come here. I brought you in,

strong supporter,

579
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,430
That's why I didn't know what to do
with you.  I suppose I could just, ah,

580
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,530
Write it  off to your .. learning curve.

581

I appreciate that.

582
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:16,300
I least you can now see
that you didn't have .

583
01:23:16,720 --> 01:23:18,300
Or Bourne, .

584
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:20,820
I'll deal with him, do you understand

585
01:23:21,330 --> 01:23:24,720
Of course. 
I agree completely.

586
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:31,870
When you're on stage, .

587
01:23:32,080 --> 01:23:34,610
- I'll be ready, sir.

Yeah, we.. we went to Stanford together.

591

- How are you enjoying life at the Agency 
- Challenging, but fulfilling.

592
01:24:23,160 --> 01:24:25,670
, still your interest over there

593
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:28,820
My principles are just fine, thanks.

594
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:32,850
Gentlemen, we're ready for you. 
Follow me, please.

596
01:25:12,460 --> 01:25:15,400
Oh, hi. How's everyone doing tonight

597
01:25:16,150 --> 01:25:17,360
Welcome.

598
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,760
Welcome to tonight's EXOCON Symposium.

599
01:25:27,100 --> 01:25:31,010
We are so lucky to have four 
fantastic guests this evening.

600
01:25:31,600 --> 01:25:34,470
CIA Director, Robert Dewey

601
01:25:37,380 --> 01:25:40,580
Dear friend of mine,
and old friend of EXOCON,

602
01:25:40,610 --> 01:25:45,030
CEO social media giant DEEP 
DREAM, Aaron Kalloor is here.

603
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:26,150
, Personal rights vs Public safety.

604
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:28,490
This is the great question of our time.

605
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,920
And the choices we make about 
this will determine our future.

606
01:26:32,490 --> 01:26:34,770
So let's just dive right in, okay

607
01:26:37,050 --> 01:26:38,570
Come on, you guys!

608
01:26:38,570 --> 01:26:40,640
Sir, you have an incoming message.

609
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:42,450
- High priority.

610
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,340
Alright guys, I'm going 
to have to take this.

611
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,070
- 1:26:45.34 .

612
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:11,630
It appears Director Dewey settled 
down momentarily, and I mean

613
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:14,900
I'm told that it shouldn't
be too much longer,

614
01:27:14,950 --> 01:27:18,040
But we have a ton of stuff to get into 
tonight, so I'm going to start anyway.

615
01:27:18,120 --> 01:27:19,770
Craig, can I say a few words

616
01:27:19,910 --> 01:27:21,950
- Excuse me 
- Can I get normal

617
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,440
Oh, sure man. By all means. 
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.

618
01:27:37,100 --> 01:27:38,790
Thank you, thanks a lot.

619
01:27:46,270 --> 01:27:49,420
Before the Director comes 
 out to join us, I just

620
01:27:49,460 --> 01:27:51,580
just wanted to share a
few words with you guys.

621
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,300
A long time ago, I,
I had this idea.

622
01:27:54,570 --> 01:27:56,080
Copy that.

623
01:27:57,130 --> 01:27:59,950
Facial recognition got a hit on 

624
01:27:59,990 --> 01:28:02,390
He was  in Vegas like two hours ago.

625
01:28:03,380 --> 01:28:05,230
- 1:28:02.39  

626
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:08,660
Someone issued an Agency 
security clearance on his passport.

627
01:28:14,190 --> 01:28:16,670
... people from aroun the world 
 started using our service,

628
01:28:21,540 --> 01:28:27,280
SOMETHING's WRONG

629
01:28:33,260 --> 01:28:37,010
Come on stay, take care of
Kalloor, and the girl.

630
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:38,690
Copy.

631
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,690
What I want to say is, you know,

632
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:42,950
All this success has come at a cost,

633
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:46,200
There's a cancer at the heart

634
01:28:46,470 --> 01:28:47,740
of DEEP DREAM,

635
01:28:48,610 --> 01:28:50,060
A guilty secret,

636
01:28:50,170 --> 01:28:52,740
and now, ah, now I have to share it

637
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:54,160
with all of you guys, so

638
01:28:54,220 --> 01:28:57,320
Just have to take a . Take  
out Kalloor and the girl right now.

639
01:29:08,680 --> 01:29:11,370
I, took money to ah, start my company

640
01:29:13,380 --> 01:29:16,160
and made a bargain with
the guy in the dark suit.

641
01:29:19,010 --> 01:29:21,550
And now, he's come back to take my soul.

642
01:29:37,980 --> 01:29:39,530
Sir, we got to go.

643

651
01:30:42,680 --> 01:30:43,880
Hey!

652
01:31:02,610 --> 01:31:05,820
Okay, we got him, sir.  
We've ID'd the sniper.

653
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,400
- Shit!

654
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:10,850
- What about Bourne

655
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:15,450
Okay, Bourne is just leaving the west 
stairs corridor heading for the lobby.

656
01:31:15,490 --> 01:31:17,280
Copy that.  Stay on Bourne.

657
01:31:20,140 --> 01:31:24,310
- Horton. 
- We're still looking for Bourne. 
 They've ID'd the IAD asset.

658
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:44,700
Go back to the first floor, and wait for 
further instructions.- Yes, sir, copy that.

659
01:32:02,550 --> 01:32:04,320
Stop right there. 
Put it down.

660
01:32:05,160 --> 01:32:06,920
Move, move, move.

661
01:32:32,790 --> 01:32:35,790
 to the northeast elevator, now.

662
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:45,170
Bourne is on his way up to you.

663
01:33:35,070 --> 01:33:36,920
You took a long time to get here, Jason.

664
01:33:38,740 --> 01:33:40,180
I know about Beirut.

665
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:42,520
I know what you did.

666
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:45,660
It all ends tonight.

667
01:33:46,550 --> 01:33:48,600
It'll a lot easier if do it right away.

668
01:33:56,610 --> 01:34:00,000
You didn't come here for revenge. 
You came because it's time to come in.

669
01:34:08,630 --> 01:34:13,430
Your father created the program. Didn't 
have what it takes to make it work.

670
01:34:14,150 --> 01:34:15,320
And you did.

671
01:34:16,260 --> 01:34:17,600
You always did.

672
01:34:20,270 --> 01:34:24,320
- That's why you volunteered. - I volunteered 
because I thought terrorists killed Lou.

673
01:34:26,000 --> 01:34:30,270
- I volunteered because of a lie. 
- No. You volunteered becasue of who you are.

674
01:34:31,280 --> 01:34:33,350
You volunteered because 
you are Jason Bourne.

675
01:34:33,390 --> 01:34:35,590
And, not, David Webb.

676
01:34:45,380 --> 01:34:47,400
32 kills, Jason.

677
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:51,490
 
people all across this country,

678
01:34:51,530 --> 01:34:53,800
Are safer because of what you did.

679
01:34:53,880 --> 01:34:55,860
- 1:34:53.80  .

680
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:07,390
I tried to find another way.

681
01:35:11,290 --> 01:35:13,360
And how's that working out for you

682
01:35:21,380 --> 01:35:23,720
You didn't any peace.

683
01:35:25,130 --> 01:35:27,940
NOt till you admit to
yourself, who you really are.

684
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,370
It's sudden death here, Jason.

685
01:35:34,110 --> 01:35:35,510
Stop doing it.

686
01:35:39,870 --> 01:35:42,990
- So 
- I can't.

687
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,440
Not for you.

688
01:36:25,410 --> 01:36:26,960
You were never here.

689
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:36,410
You don't have to walk.

690
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:41,280
This can stop now.

691
01:36:42,100 --> 01:36:43,700
You have a choice.

692
01:38:06,870 --> 01:38:12,690
 All units, suspect stole 
 a 2015 black dodge charger.

693
01:43:38,560 --> 01:43:41,440
This is Air One, be advised, 
suspects vehicles have crashed

694
01:43:41,490 --> 01:43:43,580
On the southeast entrance of the Riviera.

695
01:43:55,000 --> 01:43:58,340
We have unkown a suspect heading 
to the storm-drain of the Riviera.

696
01:45:47,880 --> 01:45:50,640
You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.

697
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:54,150
- 1:45:50.64 .

698
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:35,920
 work with the authorities, 
to find out who's responsible.

699
01:47:36,030 --> 01:47:39,200
- 1:47:35.92  .

700
01:47:39,740 --> 01:47:40,860
Thank you.

701
01:48:13,890 --> 01:48:15,120
Sir.

702
01:48:25,100 --> 01:48:26,890
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

703
01:48:27,310 --> 01:48:28,830
About Vegas.

704
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:32,880
I read that Dewey's tactics
were .. unwise.

705
01:48:33,010 --> 01:48:34,180
Unwise.

706
01:48:35,380 --> 01:48:38,700
We're still trying to come up with a 
narrative to explain what happened.

707
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:42,440
That son-of-a-bitch put 
a spotlight on our heads.

708
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:44,790
All of us.

709
01:48:45,110 --> 01:48:46,940
- 1:48:44.79 yet .

710
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,840
I know her. 

711
01:48:51,270 --> 01:48:53,260
There's still moves we can make.

712
01:48:56,470 --> 01:48:57,270
Tell me.

713
01:48:58,380 --> 01:49:01,160
Dewey's problem was that 
he clung on to the past.

714
01:49:02,740 --> 01:49:05,120
People are    the future.

715
01:49:05,600 --> 01:49:07,140
These are my people.

716
01:49:08,450 --> 01:49:09,800
I know what to do over.

717
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:15,040
and what do you want

718
01:49:16,600 --> 01:49:19,550
When you appoint someone head of your 
Agency, you're going to need someone,

719
01:49:19,590 --> 01:49:21,650
Working .

720
01:49:22,390 --> 01:49:23,590
Someone ...

721
01:49:24,780 --> 01:49:25,960
An hour, .

722
01:49:26,300 --> 01:49:28,050
By you, 

723
01:49:28,730 --> 01:49:29,770
- 1:49:28.05- .

724
01:49:30,810 --> 01:49:32,290
What about Bourne

725
01:49:33,490 --> 01:49:35,260
You still think you can bring him in

726
01:49:38,400 --> 01:49:39,740
I have his trust.

727
01:49:40,830 --> 01:49:42,270
After all we've been through.

728
01:49:43,760 --> 01:49:45,290
I'll bring him in.

729
01:49:45,670 --> 01:49:47,280
I'm certain of it.

730
01:49:49,640 --> 01:49:50,920
What if you can't

731
01:49:53,000 --> 01:49:54,010
Then ..

732
01:49:55,150 --> 01:49:56,830
He'll have to be put down.

733
01:50:00,400 --> 01:50:02,190
That's an interesting proposal.

734
01:50:07,440 --> 01:50:09,400
You can pull over here.

735
01:50:13,770 --> 01:50:16,640
Of course if you decide
you don't need me,

736
01:50:17,470 --> 01:50:18,910
That's not a problem.

737
01:50:19,160 --> 01:50:22,010
There are many other agencies 
that want what I know.

738
01:50:51,760 --> 01:50:53,280
I brought you something.

739
01:50:58,760 --> 01:51:02,510
It's a cast from you father's
star, on Memorial Wall.

740
01:51:13,470 --> 01:51:15,320
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

741
01:51:18,040 --> 01:51:21,630
I . The people who did that, are gone.

742
01:51:22,350 --> 01:51:23,300
And,

743
01:51:24,080 --> 01:51:26,040
Things are changing in the Agency.

744
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,270
What is it you want

745
01:51:30,910 --> 01:51:33,200
I know you've always been a patriot.

746
01:51:34,530 --> 01:51:37,300
And what happens to this 
country, matters to you.

747
01:51:38,890 --> 01:51:41,040
We need you to help us protect it.

748
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:43,620
Come back in.

749
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,560
And we'll work together.

750
01:51:55,530 --> 01:51:56,970
Let me think about it.

751
01:51:58,400 --> 01:52:00,070
How will I find you.

752
01:52:46,310 --> 01:52:48,230
You still think you can bring him in

753
01:52:48,450 --> 01:52:49,920
I have his trust.

754
01:52:50,950 --> 01:52:52,810
After all we've been through.

755
01:52:53,620 --> 01:52:54,920
I'll bring him in.

756
01:52:55,490 --> 01:52:57,280
I'm certain of it.

757
01:52:57,960 --> 01:52:59,520
And if you can't

758
01:53:01,460 --> 01:53:02,380
Then,

759
01:53:02,970 --> 01:53:04,900
He'll have to be put down.

760
01:53:10,270 --> 01:53:14,960
I"M NOT SURPRISED, MOTHERFUCKERS!
