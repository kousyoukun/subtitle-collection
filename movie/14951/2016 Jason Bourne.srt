2
00:00:57,684 --> 00:00:59,235
I remember.

3
00:01:00,353 --> 00:01:02,364
I remember everything.

4
00:01:05,984 --> 00:01:09,067
Captain Webb. Good morning.

5
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,995
Has everything been explained to you?

6
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:14,450
Yes, sir.

7
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:19,658
When we are finished with you,
you will no longer be David Webb.

8
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:22,005
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.

9
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:28,380
You knew exactly what it meant
for you if you chose to stay.

10
00:01:30,508 --> 00:01:32,639
You can't outrun what you did, Jason.

11
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,931
You made yourself into who you are.

12
00:01:37,515 --> 00:01:40,596
Eventually you're gonna have
to face the fact.

13
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,807
You volunteered.

14
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:27,852
Christian Dassault made a reservation.

15
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,281
Heather Lee.

16
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:40,472
Ma'am, we have a device

17
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:43,553
issued to a stay-behind team
in Novosibirsk, Russia, in 1993.

18
00:05:43,928 --> 00:05:46,259
Marked on our inventory as destroyed.

19
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:48,927
It's knocking on our front door.

20
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,290
What's the status?

21
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:19,513
Whoever it is, is just sitting there idle.

22
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:25,758
There's no outbound traffic, nothing.

23
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,389
Move.

24
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,173
They've found a back door.

25
00:06:37,273 --> 00:06:39,926
We need the reverse shell.
I'm gonna locate the source.

26
00:06:40,026 --> 00:06:41,027
I'm working on it.

27
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:44,097
Okay, people, we have a major breach
of our classified mainframe.

28
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:46,238
Drop everything you're doing,
get on it right now!

29
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:14,586
Ma'am, I'm sending you the shell.

30
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:16,796
Got it.

31
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:18,423
- Need it right now?
- Yeah.

32
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:19,924
- Getting IP.
- Where's that traceroute?

33
00:07:20,024 --> 00:07:21,655
Unknown user. Monitoring.

34
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:25,496
Reykjavik.

35
00:07:27,198 --> 00:07:28,475
SecOps hacking camp.

36
00:07:28,575 --> 00:07:29,768
Kill the power to the building.

37
00:07:29,868 --> 00:07:31,394
Get into that power grid now.

38
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:32,545
Yes, sir.

39
00:07:44,007 --> 00:07:46,257
- I've got the power to the building.
- Stand by.

40
00:07:47,177 --> 00:07:50,013
- Ten seconds.
- Let's get on top of this.

41
00:07:51,806 --> 00:07:55,062
- Shut it down.
- Copy that. Shutting it down.

42
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,558
Dewey.

43
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:37,938
We've just been hacked.

44
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,504
How badly?

45
00:08:39,604 --> 00:08:41,235
Could be worse than Snowden.

46
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:43,441
Is there any attribution?

47
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:44,634
We're working on it.

48
00:08:44,734 --> 00:08:47,887
Lee says it must be someone
with a deep knowledge of our systems.

49
00:08:47,987 --> 00:08:50,698
This could affect Deep Dream, and Iron Hand.

50
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:56,577
I want a briefing
in my conference room in one hour.

51
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,131
Yes.

52
00:09:08,466 --> 00:09:11,337
- Did you get confirmation?
- Yeah, there was a hack.

53
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:13,246
So are we exposed?

54
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:15,177
We don't know yet. We're checking.

55
00:09:15,306 --> 00:09:16,833
I want you to call Dewey.
Set up a meet in DC.

56
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,042
Aaron, we got a lot at stake here,

57
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:20,483
- maybe we shouldn't rock the boat.
- Just do it.

58
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:25,480
Hey, George. We ready for the launch?

59
00:10:32,342 --> 00:10:35,078
Heather, you know
the Director of National Intelligence?

60
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,049
Heather Lee, Cyber Ops, sir.

61
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:39,582
Have you got a name for us?

62
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:42,063
The hacker was a former Agency operative.

63
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,338
Believed to be working
with Christian Dassault,

64
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:47,819
and previously linked to Jason Bourne.

65
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,571
Bourne?

66
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:53,155
- Jesus Christ.
- What did they get?

67
00:10:53,696 --> 00:10:55,014
Black-ops files.

68
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:57,785
From Treadstone all the way to Iron Hand.

69
00:10:58,576 --> 00:11:00,353
Iron Hand?

70
00:11:00,453 --> 00:11:03,481
But that's not even operational yet,
for Christ's sakes.

71
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:06,332
Where is Nicky Parsons right now?

72
00:11:06,584 --> 00:11:07,986
On the move.

73
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,587
She left Reykjavik,
traveling through Bucharest to Athens.

74
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,631
Feels like a meet to me.

75
00:11:15,552 --> 00:11:17,763
Well, how are you going to handle it?

76
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,933
We cut the head off this thing.

77
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:29,690
Sir, I'd like to be point on this operation.

78
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,680
You're not indoctrinated for this material.

79
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,015
I'm already into it.

80
00:11:37,115 --> 00:11:38,996
I embedded malware into Parsons' download.

81
00:11:39,742 --> 00:11:42,373
When those files are opened,
I can trace them.

82
00:11:43,329 --> 00:11:44,790
Let me in.

83
00:11:46,332 --> 00:11:48,693
I'll deliver Parsons, the files,

84
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:51,804
and, if he's out there,
I'll give you Bourne, too.

85
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:00,975
Excuse me.

86
00:12:07,103 --> 00:12:08,854
I appreciate your enthusiasm,

87
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:14,285
but do not push your personal agenda
to the DNI again.

88
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,262
Understood.

89
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:18,823
All right. I think you can help me.

90
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:22,125
I'm going to give you
full operational control on this,

91
00:12:22,452 --> 00:12:26,564
and I will make sure you have access
to any relevant teams and resources.

92
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:30,255
And I want to know every move you make.

93
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:31,711
Yes, sir.

94
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,171
Thank you very much, sir.

95
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:01,866
Yeah?

96
00:13:02,033 --> 00:13:03,664
I need your help, now.

97
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,750
I'm not finished here.

98
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,171
Jason Bourne is in play.

99
00:13:11,626 --> 00:13:13,570
- Where?
- Athens.

100
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:16,011
Close your account in Rome.

101
00:13:16,756 --> 00:13:18,167
Understood.

102
00:16:30,909 --> 00:16:32,769
Lee got a hit from a CCTV feed.

103
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:35,480
Parsons boarded a bus a half-hour ago,
headed west across Athens.

104
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,148
I got two local teams en route.

105
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:39,609
- Any sign of Bourne?
- Not so far.

106
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:42,420
He's involved in this somehow. I can feel it.

107
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,837
Upload all Athens data and feeds,
and activate real-time processing.

108
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:49,969
Copy that.

109
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:53,307
Where are we?

110
00:16:54,224 --> 00:16:56,895
Parsons' bus has just arrived
at Syntagma Square.

111
00:16:57,352 --> 00:17:00,004
There's a demonstration
in front of the Greek parliament building.

112
00:17:00,104 --> 00:17:01,445
I think she'll use it as cover.

113
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,111
Deploy Alpha and Bravo to the square.

114
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:07,178
Recon for Parsons
in the crowd outside parliament,

115
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,239
and any possible rendezvous points.

116
00:17:09,405 --> 00:17:10,486
Copy that, sir.

117
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,578
Sir, the Asset has landed.

118
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:46,440
Alpha Team arriving now.

119
00:17:46,901 --> 00:17:47,902
Copy that.

120
00:18:18,308 --> 00:18:19,959
I have the Alpha Team feeds.

121
00:18:20,059 --> 00:18:21,190
Pull them up.

122
00:18:46,252 --> 00:18:49,280
Athens police are reporting tactical teams
moving on the demonstrators.

123
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,950
Isolate all social-media posts
from the square.

124
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:53,131
Yes, ma'am.

125
00:19:21,287 --> 00:19:22,788
Rewind Alpha One's feed.

126
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:24,918
Yes, ma'am. Twenty seconds.

127
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,131
All right, Bravo Two, Four, moving in.

128
00:19:40,265 --> 00:19:41,726
What's wrong?

129
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,484
I hacked the Agency.

130
00:19:44,352 --> 00:19:46,004
For Christian Dassault.

131
00:19:46,104 --> 00:19:47,405
I got all the black-ops files.

132
00:19:47,564 --> 00:19:49,115
We're putting them online.

133
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:51,324
We need to move.

134
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:55,613
Stop.

135
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,032
Two seconds forward.

136
00:19:58,408 --> 00:19:59,529
Blonde hair.

137
00:20:02,996 --> 00:20:03,997
Enhance.

138
00:20:09,252 --> 00:20:10,423
Find her.

139
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:17,535
Nicky Parsons sighted in Syntagma Square.
Redirect south on Stadiou.

140
00:20:17,635 --> 00:20:20,580
I told you, Christian Dassault
is going to get you killed.

141
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,207
We don't have a choice, Jason.

142
00:20:22,307 --> 00:20:24,638
It's started again. A new program.

143
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:26,461
Iron Hand. It's even worse than before.

144
00:20:26,561 --> 00:20:28,171
What's that got to do with me?

145
00:20:28,271 --> 00:20:30,298
Because it matters. It matters.

146
00:20:30,398 --> 00:20:32,069
Not to me, it doesn't.

147
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,927
All that matters is staying alive.

148
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:36,387
You get off the grid, survive.

149
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:38,765
I don't believe that and neither do you.

150
00:20:38,865 --> 00:20:40,836
Look at yourself.

151
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,769
Look at what you're doing.

152
00:20:42,869 --> 00:20:45,410
You can't live like this for much longer.

153
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:50,860
Jason, I came here
because I found something.

154
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,251
I found your father's name
in the Treadstone files.

155
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:54,989
He was an analyst.

156
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,742
He wasn't in Operations.
He wasn't near any of that stuff.

157
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:01,643
I'm telling you what I saw.
It looked like he was involved directly.

158
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,498
And there's more.

159
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:04,624
More about you.

160
00:21:04,724 --> 00:21:05,735
What do you mean?

161
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:09,520
Before you joined the program,
they were watching you.

162
00:21:09,646 --> 00:21:11,557
Watching me?

163
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,401
You've tortured yourself
for a long time now, Jason.

164
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:18,096
You torture yourself for what you've done.

165
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:20,932
But you don't know the truth
about what they did to you.

166
00:21:21,032 --> 00:21:23,333
You need to read those files.

167
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,421
Move. They tracked you.

168
00:21:34,337 --> 00:21:37,824
Alpha One has eyes on two targets.
One female, one male.

169
00:21:37,924 --> 00:21:38,908
Identify the male.

170
00:21:39,008 --> 00:21:40,118
Copy that, sir.

171
00:21:40,218 --> 00:21:42,469
Alpha One, we need an ID on the male target.

172
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:46,388
We've got to get out of here before
the police cut off this part of the city.

173
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:52,814
Head north.

174
00:21:54,232 --> 00:21:55,523
Meet me at the statue of Athena.

175
00:21:56,693 --> 00:21:58,284
I'll take them with me.

176
00:22:04,993 --> 00:22:06,334
That's him.

177
00:22:07,245 --> 00:22:08,256
Now.

178
00:22:14,085 --> 00:22:16,279
Stay with Bourne.

179
00:22:16,379 --> 00:22:18,448
Clear to engage the target.

180
00:22:18,548 --> 00:22:19,574
Copy.

181
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:21,935
Alpha Team, stay with the male.
You are clear to engage.

182
00:22:46,201 --> 00:22:47,372
Come on.

183
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:25,974
Sir, Alpha Team comms are down.

184
00:23:26,074 --> 00:23:27,665
We've lost him, sir. He's taken them out.

185
00:23:29,494 --> 00:23:32,147
Find Parsons. He'll come back to get her.

186
00:23:32,247 --> 00:23:33,314
Sir, rioting is spreading.

187
00:23:33,414 --> 00:23:36,465
The Greek government
is declaring a state of emergency.

188
00:23:40,088 --> 00:23:42,169
Bravo Team, we are retargeting Parsons.

189
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,897
We got her.

190
00:24:42,192 --> 00:24:43,903
Split the team, put her in a box.

191
00:26:06,985 --> 00:26:09,956
A suspect matching Bourne's description
has stolen a police motorcycle.

192
00:26:10,113 --> 00:26:11,598
He's coming for Parsons.

193
00:26:11,698 --> 00:26:12,766
Where the hell is the Asset?

194
00:26:12,866 --> 00:26:13,947
Two minutes out, sir.

195
00:26:46,941 --> 00:26:48,593
Parsons is at the statue of Athena.

196
00:26:48,693 --> 00:26:49,694
Copy that.

197
00:27:13,927 --> 00:27:15,428
Bravo Team is down.

198
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:17,372
Sir, the Asset is arriving on scene.

199
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:18,706
- Pull up the dash cam.
- Copy.

200
00:27:18,806 --> 00:27:21,057
Give me the feed
and direct comms to the Asset.

201
00:27:28,608 --> 00:27:30,189
Engaging targets.

202
00:27:46,751 --> 00:27:49,252
I'm accessing Athens police tactical data.

203
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:50,488
I need eyes overhead.

204
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:52,198
Bring up the satellite suite.

205
00:27:52,298 --> 00:27:55,201
Sir, I'm showing a Misty
and a KH-12 satellite available.

206
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:57,092
- Light up the 12.
- Yes, sir.

207
00:28:10,066 --> 00:28:11,527
Satellite video feed is online.

208
00:28:15,238 --> 00:28:16,739
Police have blocked the road to the north.

209
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:19,286
The target will be forced to turn left.

210
00:28:32,797 --> 00:28:34,699
Another barricade in 200 meters.

211
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,720
Target turning left again.

212
00:28:48,688 --> 00:28:49,899
Bourne's heading for the alley.

213
00:28:50,273 --> 00:28:51,694
Left at the top of the hill.

214
00:29:24,599 --> 00:29:25,583
Stairway.

215
00:29:25,683 --> 00:29:27,394
Up the hill. Heading east.

216
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,003
Give me a strike point.

217
00:29:29,103 --> 00:29:30,588
He's found a way out.

218
00:29:30,688 --> 00:29:32,340
Two hundred meters to your left.

219
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:37,387
19 Solomou. Get to the roof.
Target should pass within your line of sight.

220
00:29:37,487 --> 00:29:39,158
19 Solomou. Copy.

221
00:29:47,455 --> 00:29:49,607
Focus the satellites on these coordinates.

222
00:29:49,707 --> 00:29:51,578
And give me a lock
on the motorcycle when it gets there.

223
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:52,750
Copy that.

224
00:30:19,362 --> 00:30:21,663
I've got the targets.
They're approaching Omonia from Fidiou.

225
00:30:22,949 --> 00:30:24,267
Look west.

226
00:30:24,367 --> 00:30:25,528
The long boulevard.

227
00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:28,396
Coming at you in 55 seconds.

228
00:30:28,496 --> 00:30:29,827
Copy that.

229
00:30:53,855 --> 00:30:55,406
The Asset is online.

230
00:31:08,494 --> 00:31:10,125
Target's with you in 15 seconds.

231
00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,131
Five seconds.

232
00:31:27,013 --> 00:31:28,081
Contact.

233
00:31:28,181 --> 00:31:29,222
Stay low!

234
00:31:33,978 --> 00:31:35,309
Find a shot.

235
00:31:38,691 --> 00:31:39,732
Hold on!

236
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:57,790
Targets are down.

237
00:32:17,689 --> 00:32:18,673
Where's Bourne?

238
00:32:18,773 --> 00:32:21,468
Ma'am, a police helicopter spotted
three bodies on the roof near the Asset.

239
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:23,319
A tactical team's on its way.

240
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,411
Nicky?

241
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,301
Don't move!

242
00:32:57,896 --> 00:32:59,964
Athens police have entered the building.

243
00:33:00,064 --> 00:33:02,717
Asset, you need to get out of there.

244
00:33:02,817 --> 00:33:04,068
Negative.

245
00:33:06,446 --> 00:33:08,447
We don't even know if Bourne's alive.

246
00:33:09,824 --> 00:33:11,415
You want to lose this guy?

247
00:33:16,789 --> 00:33:17,857
This is Director Dewey.

248
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:19,628
You have 20 seconds.

249
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:26,385
Hold on, Nicky.

250
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,388
I'm going to get you to cover.

251
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,801
No.

252
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:38,391
No.

253
00:33:40,396 --> 00:33:42,357
No, don't.

254
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:47,069
I'm coming.

255
00:34:45,128 --> 00:34:47,379
- Get a location on Christian Dassault.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:34:47,505 --> 00:34:51,338
If he was working with Nicky Parsons,
he will lead us to Jason Bourne.

257
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:54,008
And let me know if you get
a hit on that malware.

258
00:34:54,637 --> 00:34:56,178
Sir, can I clarify one thing?

259
00:34:56,973 --> 00:34:57,974
Yeah.

260
00:34:58,683 --> 00:35:00,694
Does the Asset know Bourne?

261
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:03,254
Why would you ask me that?

262
00:35:03,354 --> 00:35:04,865
His behavior on the rooftop.

263
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,941
It suggested a connection.

264
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,030
The last time Bourne came back,
he exposed the Blackbriar program.

265
00:35:13,781 --> 00:35:16,332
It compromised active operations.

266
00:35:16,701 --> 00:35:19,542
The Asset was in Syria undercover.

267
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:25,384
He was captured, tortured,
and it took two damn years to get him out.

268
00:35:26,961 --> 00:35:29,531
So you think that's why
Bourne wants the files?

269
00:35:29,631 --> 00:35:30,865
To go public again?

270
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:32,617
I have no idea why he came back.

271
00:35:32,717 --> 00:35:34,619
But whatever he's doing,
he wants to destroy us.

272
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:35,800
We can't let that happen.

273
00:35:37,514 --> 00:35:41,105
So, you give me a call
soon as you hear anything.

274
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,771
Yes, sir.

275
00:38:36,568 --> 00:38:39,721
And now, the founder
and chairman of Deep Dream,

276
00:38:39,821 --> 00:38:42,192
Aaron Kalloor.

277
00:38:43,408 --> 00:38:44,409
Hi.

278
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:50,665
Uh...

279
00:38:50,999 --> 00:38:52,025
You all know why we're here.

280
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:53,902
We're gonna be unveiling a new platform.

281
00:38:54,002 --> 00:38:57,553
We think it is a bold new step
to allow us to serve our community better.

282
00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:01,409
We're a community right now
that is transcending national boundaries.

283
00:39:01,509 --> 00:39:05,030
And I think we're 1.5 billion users.

284
00:39:12,604 --> 00:39:15,632
In a nutshell, as you know,
we have an ecosystem

285
00:39:15,732 --> 00:39:18,510
of hundreds of thousands
of apps at this point.

286
00:39:18,610 --> 00:39:20,386
And what this new platform will do

287
00:39:20,486 --> 00:39:23,932
will be to integrate users' data
and preferences,

288
00:39:24,032 --> 00:39:26,101
and use that information

289
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:30,146
to enrich and tailor-make
each unique user experience

290
00:39:30,246 --> 00:39:32,617
in a way that is, frankly, unprecedented.

291
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:35,527
Um, now, I can see some
journalists' pens twitching,

292
00:39:35,627 --> 00:39:37,946
- ready to ask about privacy.
- Yeah.

293
00:39:38,046 --> 00:39:40,365
This is a concern to many people,
and so it should be.

294
00:39:40,465 --> 00:39:44,119
I mean, this is something that matters to us.
And let me just say, uh,

295
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:47,100
I understand nobody wants to
feel like they're being watched.

296
00:39:47,263 --> 00:39:51,292
So let me just tell you, when you come
to Deep Dream, when you use our service,

297
00:39:51,392 --> 00:39:53,743
no one will be watching you.

298
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:12,758
- Mr. Kalloor.
- Right this way, sir.

299
00:40:22,465 --> 00:40:23,742
Enjoy your meal.

300
00:40:23,842 --> 00:40:24,973
Thank you.

301
00:40:27,345 --> 00:40:28,580
Congratulations.

302
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:31,021
I hear your stockholders
were very happy with that new platform.

303
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:33,517
And I heard you got hacked.

304
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:36,755
We're dealing with it.

305
00:40:36,855 --> 00:40:39,986
This changes everything.
There's too much risk.

306
00:40:40,525 --> 00:40:41,616
I'm out.

307
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:42,987
Aaron,

308
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,411
you are an extraordinarily gifted
and perceptive young man.

309
00:40:47,532 --> 00:40:48,933
When you agreed to help us,

310
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:53,744
it was because you understood
the very grave threats that...

311
00:41:00,837 --> 00:41:02,947
Do you have any idea of the shit-storm
I'll have on my hands

312
00:41:03,047 --> 00:41:05,218
if this arrangement becomes public?

313
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:08,760
I already took a hit with Snowden,
and you want more?

314
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,721
Our enemies have become
much more sophisticated.

315
00:41:11,973 --> 00:41:14,292
Gathering metadata is no longer adequate.

316
00:41:14,392 --> 00:41:18,755
We need a back door into your new
platform, and a way past the encryptions.

317
00:41:18,855 --> 00:41:21,196
And when that's not enough,
you'll want something new.

318
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:24,404
You don't get it, do you?

319
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:27,806
Privacy is freedom.

320
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:30,067
Maybe that's something
you should think about defending.

321
00:41:30,325 --> 00:41:32,393
You little prick, you didn't believe
in privacy or freedom

322
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:35,063
when we funded your startup,
turned you into a billionaire.

323
00:41:35,163 --> 00:41:37,674
I paid you back many, many, many times over.

324
00:41:38,082 --> 00:41:40,173
And I was never comfortable with any of this.

325
00:41:40,668 --> 00:41:41,879
I'm out.

326
00:41:43,671 --> 00:41:45,115
I'm done selling out our customers.

327
00:41:45,215 --> 00:41:46,926
But you would sell out your country.

328
00:41:48,176 --> 00:41:50,995
The truth is, we wouldn't be
having this conversation

329
00:41:51,095 --> 00:41:54,249
if you didn't feel personally at risk.

330
00:41:54,349 --> 00:41:57,669
You talk about a free Internet,
you tell yourself you're saving the world,

331
00:41:57,769 --> 00:42:00,600
but all you're doing is making it
a much more dangerous place.

332
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,260
And you're sure as hell making
this country much more difficult to defend.

333
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,951
And you're sure as hell
accountable for that, Aaron.

334
00:42:11,449 --> 00:42:12,950
Accountable.

335
00:44:34,092 --> 00:44:35,433
Bourne?

336
00:44:35,593 --> 00:44:37,934
Everything on the table.

337
00:44:54,070 --> 00:44:55,241
Open it.

338
00:45:00,785 --> 00:45:01,946
Sure.

339
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:38,656
Bourne has surfaced. In Berlin.

340
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:40,241
Get the Berlin team up.

341
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:54,589
Where is she?

342
00:45:54,923 --> 00:45:56,764
She's dead.

343
00:46:00,637 --> 00:46:01,638
She knew the risks.

344
00:46:03,264 --> 00:46:04,815
I warned her.

345
00:46:05,683 --> 00:46:07,234
She made a choice.

346
00:46:07,769 --> 00:46:09,810
You exploited her.

347
00:46:27,372 --> 00:46:28,543
Berlin team is mobile.

348
00:46:28,706 --> 00:46:30,400
What do we have on the location?

349
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:32,251
It's an address linked to Christian Dassault.

350
00:46:32,377 --> 00:46:33,403
Anything on Bourne?

351
00:46:33,503 --> 00:46:36,674
Nothing yet. I'm accessing CCTV now.

352
00:46:38,049 --> 00:46:41,720
Sir, I've been thinking,
maybe we've got this wrong.

353
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,891
What if he's not coming for us?

354
00:46:45,723 --> 00:46:47,064
What if it's something else?

355
00:46:49,227 --> 00:46:51,848
You don't have any idea
who you're dealing with.

356
00:47:03,032 --> 00:47:04,413
We should work together, Bourne.

357
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:07,831
You exposed the Blackbriar program.

358
00:47:09,455 --> 00:47:12,317
We're both after the same thing, right?

359
00:47:12,417 --> 00:47:16,248
We both want to take down the corrupt
institutions that control society.

360
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:19,468
I'm not on your side.

361
00:47:36,524 --> 00:47:38,285
CCTV feed is online.

362
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,598
He's on a computer.

363
00:47:43,698 --> 00:47:45,892
We have to stop this.

364
00:47:45,992 --> 00:47:49,020
If he puts those files online,
operations will be compromised

365
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,230
and people will die.

366
00:47:50,330 --> 00:47:51,581
Yes, sir.

367
00:47:56,753 --> 00:47:59,304
At least when you're done,
leave me the files.

368
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:02,552
These programs have to be exposed.

369
00:48:03,593 --> 00:48:05,514
People have a right to know.

370
00:48:22,403 --> 00:48:23,824
We need that computer.

371
00:48:29,827 --> 00:48:31,288
There's a phone in the room.

372
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:33,000
I can use it to delete the files.

373
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:01,285
- Got the phone.
- Where's that team?

374
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:02,693
Five minutes out, sir.

375
00:49:02,861 --> 00:49:04,492
We're running out of time. Get there.

376
00:49:48,198 --> 00:49:49,659
Listen to me, David.

377
00:49:49,824 --> 00:49:51,415
I've done something.

378
00:49:52,285 --> 00:49:53,496
Something...

379
00:49:55,413 --> 00:49:57,124
...that came at a cost.

380
00:49:58,082 --> 00:50:00,253
One day you'll understand why.

381
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:03,962
I gotta get back to Washington.

382
00:50:05,423 --> 00:50:06,884
I love you, son.

383
00:50:59,143 --> 00:51:00,564
They're fighting, sir.

384
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:13,661
One more firewall.

385
00:51:39,184 --> 00:51:40,855
Files deleted, sir.

386
00:51:43,229 --> 00:51:44,900
Call in.

387
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:22,141
Bourne, my name is Heather Lee.

388
00:52:22,852 --> 00:52:24,403
I'm not in charge here.

389
00:52:25,438 --> 00:52:27,729
I wasn't here when you went missing.

390
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:32,451
I can see you're going through
the old Treadstone files.

391
00:52:33,154 --> 00:52:34,745
Retracing your history.

392
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:38,702
I know you're looking for something.

393
00:52:39,369 --> 00:52:41,750
Let me help you find it.

394
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:48,750
Give me that phone.

395
00:52:54,092 --> 00:52:55,343
Yes, sir.

396
00:52:57,887 --> 00:53:00,348
Jason, this is Robert Dewey.
Do you remember me?

397
00:53:01,850 --> 00:53:04,335
Jason, your dad was a patriot.

398
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:07,005
He could see the threats
that America was facing,

399
00:53:07,105 --> 00:53:10,425
and, like you, he chose to serve his country

400
00:53:10,525 --> 00:53:13,036
out of a profound sense of duty.

401
00:53:14,362 --> 00:53:16,863
He would not want to
see you harm the Agency.

402
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:18,782
You have to stop this.

403
00:53:19,701 --> 00:53:21,542
And you have to stop it now.

404
00:53:26,082 --> 00:53:27,083
Sir, our ETA is...

405
00:53:51,983 --> 00:53:53,574
He's on the move. Be ready.

406
00:54:08,124 --> 00:54:09,234
Take point!

407
00:54:09,334 --> 00:54:10,360
On me!

408
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:11,841
The elevator.

409
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:01,889
We lost him, sir.

410
00:55:18,194 --> 00:55:20,764
Malcolm Smith, contract only,
based out of London.

411
00:55:20,864 --> 00:55:22,807
Ran all of Treadstone's surveillance
in the late '90s,

412
00:55:22,907 --> 00:55:23,988
when Bourne was recruited.

413
00:55:24,409 --> 00:55:25,560
Is he still active?

414
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,936
He's private security now.

415
00:55:27,036 --> 00:55:30,648
Contact the Asset and tell him I want him
on the ground in London in six hours.

416
00:55:30,748 --> 00:55:32,539
I think that could be a mistake, sir.

417
00:55:36,254 --> 00:55:37,489
A mistake? Why?

418
00:55:37,589 --> 00:55:40,880
There is an argument for catching Bourne
instead of killing him.

419
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:43,931
All right, let's hear it.

420
00:55:44,053 --> 00:55:46,915
Bourne's been off the grid for a long time.

421
00:55:47,015 --> 00:55:49,526
He's been hiding in the shadows,
he's seen things.

422
00:55:49,684 --> 00:55:51,961
He knows things that could help us.

423
00:55:52,061 --> 00:55:55,022
Bringing him back in is the smart move.

424
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,633
And how are we going to do that?

425
00:55:56,733 --> 00:55:59,744
Albert Hirsch wrote a psych evaluation
when Bourne left the program.

426
00:55:59,903 --> 00:56:02,597
He concluded Bourne
is still a patriot at heart,

427
00:56:02,697 --> 00:56:06,078
and that leaving the program
could come back to haunt him.

428
00:56:07,994 --> 00:56:09,625
And what are you suggesting?

429
00:56:09,746 --> 00:56:12,037
I watched Bourne with those files.

430
00:56:13,583 --> 00:56:15,254
Desperately looking into his past.

431
00:56:15,418 --> 00:56:18,530
And I think he's at a tipping point.

432
00:56:18,630 --> 00:56:23,013
If I could get face-to-face with him,
I think I can bring him back in.

433
00:56:23,801 --> 00:56:24,869
One attempt.

434
00:56:24,969 --> 00:56:26,890
And if it fails,

435
00:56:27,472 --> 00:56:29,523
you do what you have to.

436
00:56:33,102 --> 00:56:35,773
Well, it makes sense to me.
What do you think, Bob?

437
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:40,051
Let's give it a shot.

438
00:56:40,151 --> 00:56:41,152
All right, do it.

439
00:56:42,028 --> 00:56:44,609
Bring Bourne in, or tie it off.

440
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:45,807
But this ends now.

441
00:56:45,907 --> 00:56:47,028
Thank you, sir.

442
00:56:59,087 --> 00:57:00,128
Sir, I'm sorry...

443
00:57:00,255 --> 00:57:02,676
No, don't worry about that.

444
00:57:03,675 --> 00:57:06,016
Better get some sleep, kid.

445
00:57:07,303 --> 00:57:10,064
You got a long 24 hours ahead of you.

446
00:57:13,059 --> 00:57:14,190
Yes, sir.

447
00:57:28,491 --> 00:57:31,478
It's taking too long. It shouldn't
still be buggy this close to launch.

448
00:57:31,578 --> 00:57:32,562
Well, I don't think it's buggy.

449
00:57:32,662 --> 00:57:35,315
I think we've changed some things
that's going to change the parameters.

450
00:57:35,415 --> 00:57:36,649
We're going to have to go and...

451
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:39,402
Okay, we need to change them back.
Amanda, can we get that note over to Kyle?

452
00:57:39,502 --> 00:57:42,280
- Absolutely.
- Look, I think you're right,

453
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,841
- I just don't think we want to...
- I'm tired of waiting.

454
00:57:47,677 --> 00:57:48,995
Mr. Kalloor.

455
00:57:49,095 --> 00:57:50,205
What the hell is this?

456
00:57:50,305 --> 00:57:52,123
Mr. Kalloor, my name is John Burroughs.

457
00:57:52,223 --> 00:57:53,875
I'm from the Department of Justice.

458
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:56,002
I'm hereby serving you
with the enclosed complaint...

459
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:58,463
- Really? We have to do this in public?
- Issued by the US government

460
00:57:58,563 --> 00:58:01,633
against Deep Dream Corporation
for violation of the Sherman Act.

461
00:58:01,733 --> 00:58:05,845
This complaint requires you to preserve all
personal and corporate financial records

462
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:09,224
pending antitrust motions
to be filed in federal court.

463
00:58:09,324 --> 00:58:10,535
Good day.

464
00:58:22,128 --> 00:58:25,631
- This is Dewey.
- Aaron, it's a message.

465
00:58:25,757 --> 00:58:28,765
And maybe we should think about
what we're doing before it gets any worse.

466
00:58:28,885 --> 00:58:32,163
So, you think if we give him
what he wants, it'll end there?

467
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:35,184
You know, I'm just saying
that maybe we should listen.

468
00:58:36,476 --> 00:58:39,647
I want you to pull up all the records
of all the meetings I've ever had with Dewey.

469
00:58:40,230 --> 00:58:43,521
All the records?
Even the off-the-books discussions?

470
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:45,778
Especially those.

471
00:58:48,947 --> 00:58:52,118
We're going to Vegas.
I need an insurance policy.

472
01:00:12,155 --> 01:00:13,166
Yeah.

473
01:00:14,157 --> 01:00:15,642
Are you in London?

474
01:00:15,742 --> 01:00:16,953
Yes.

475
01:00:17,869 --> 01:00:19,750
Why are you sending her?

476
01:00:20,455 --> 01:00:22,126
She serves a purpose.

477
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,401
I work alone.

478
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:25,922
Not this time.

479
01:00:26,753 --> 01:00:28,754
Don't make this personal.

480
01:00:29,672 --> 01:00:33,284
Bourne betrayed us.
It's always been personal.

481
01:00:33,384 --> 01:00:35,475
You know who you're dealing with.

482
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:38,221
You better make sure you're ready.

483
01:00:47,565 --> 01:00:48,508
Yeah.

484
01:00:48,608 --> 01:00:51,302
There's something you should know
about Deep Dream.

485
01:00:51,402 --> 01:00:53,113
But I need an assurance

486
01:00:54,155 --> 01:00:55,906
that I have your support.

487
01:00:58,243 --> 01:01:00,334
You got it. What do you have?

488
01:01:01,037 --> 01:01:05,043
Kalloor is planning something for Vegas.

489
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:51,671
Yes?

490
01:01:51,838 --> 01:01:53,209
This is Jason Bourne.

491
01:01:54,007 --> 01:01:55,298
I need to talk.

492
01:01:56,509 --> 01:01:57,702
What about?

493
01:01:57,802 --> 01:01:59,473
I don't work for the Agency anymore.

494
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,390
Paddington Plaza, 15 minutes.

495
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:32,961
Bourne just called Smith.

496
01:02:33,713 --> 01:02:35,264
They're meeting at Paddington Plaza.

497
01:02:35,423 --> 01:02:37,075
15 minutes.

498
01:02:37,175 --> 01:02:38,766
We'll tail Smith the whole way.

499
01:02:38,968 --> 01:02:41,955
As soon as we get eyes on Bourne,
I'll approach him.

500
01:02:42,055 --> 01:02:43,373
Whatever you do, stay contained.

501
01:02:43,473 --> 01:02:46,501
I don't want the Brits crawling all over us,
asking questions.

502
01:02:46,601 --> 01:02:47,982
Understood.

503
01:02:56,486 --> 01:02:57,697
Tracking device.

504
01:02:58,738 --> 01:03:00,489
You'll hold on the south side of the bridge.

505
01:03:01,950 --> 01:03:03,531
I'll contact you if I need you.

506
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,291
Sure.

507
01:03:06,579 --> 01:03:07,580
You're the boss, right?

508
01:03:36,776 --> 01:03:39,397
Subject is on the move.
Heading toward the canal.

509
01:03:40,405 --> 01:03:42,326
Alpha Team, take a parallel track.

510
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,934
Bravo Team, follow the subject from behind.

511
01:03:45,034 --> 01:03:46,665
And keep your eyes open for Bourne.

512
01:03:47,203 --> 01:03:49,084
Bravo Team tailing subject.

513
01:03:57,922 --> 01:03:59,032
Let's go.

514
01:03:59,132 --> 01:04:00,909
In 200 meters, make a right.

515
01:04:01,009 --> 01:04:02,340
Copy that.

516
01:04:08,349 --> 01:04:11,140
Comms check. Second channel. Do you copy?

517
01:04:11,936 --> 01:04:13,338
I have you. Where are you now?

518
01:04:13,438 --> 01:04:14,609
Heading towards Smith.

519
01:04:16,441 --> 01:04:17,572
No sign of Bourne.

520
01:04:59,734 --> 01:05:02,303
Subject has turned east, into an alley.

521
01:05:02,403 --> 01:05:05,909
Alpha Team, that alley leads to
a footbridge, which will bring him to you.

522
01:05:06,366 --> 01:05:07,367
Copy that.

523
01:05:19,879 --> 01:05:21,340
Bravo Team is down.

524
01:05:21,464 --> 01:05:22,595
Sending you updated route now.

525
01:05:24,759 --> 01:05:26,220
You copy that, Smith?

526
01:05:28,638 --> 01:05:29,639
Yes.

527
01:05:47,907 --> 01:05:50,908
Bravo Team, why aren't you moving?
What's going on?

528
01:05:52,954 --> 01:05:54,465
Bravo Team, do you copy?

529
01:05:55,498 --> 01:05:57,329
What's happening, Heather? Where's Bravo?

530
01:05:57,834 --> 01:05:59,385
We're comms down on Bravo.

531
01:05:59,586 --> 01:06:01,587
Alpha Team, do you have
eyes on the subject?

532
01:06:06,801 --> 01:06:07,972
We have eyes on.

533
01:06:14,559 --> 01:06:16,440
Alpha Team, sit-rep.

534
01:06:21,649 --> 01:06:23,218
Alpha Team, report.

535
01:06:23,318 --> 01:06:24,819
What's happening, Heather?

536
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,639
Alpha Team isn't responding.

537
01:06:27,739 --> 01:06:29,307
Bravo?

538
01:06:29,407 --> 01:06:30,600
Still nothing.

539
01:06:30,700 --> 01:06:32,911
You lost both teams?
Get a grip on this operation, Heather.

540
01:06:33,036 --> 01:06:34,037
That's Bourne.

541
01:06:34,495 --> 01:06:35,906
Green-light the Asset.

542
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:38,233
Sir, I need more time.

543
01:06:38,333 --> 01:06:39,544
We have no time.

544
01:06:40,043 --> 01:06:42,028
Are you going to give that order or not?

545
01:06:42,128 --> 01:06:43,488
Sir, please.

546
01:06:43,588 --> 01:06:45,490
You are too naive to see the truth.

547
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,118
There's no bringing in Bourne.

548
01:06:48,218 --> 01:06:52,050
He has to be put down, and you obviously
cannot do what has to be done.

549
01:06:52,263 --> 01:06:54,354
I am taking operational control.

550
01:06:55,725 --> 01:06:57,476
Asset, you have a green light.

551
01:06:57,644 --> 01:07:00,463
Repeat, you have a green light on Bourne.

552
01:07:00,563 --> 01:07:01,614
Copy that.

553
01:07:01,731 --> 01:07:03,112
I'm on my way.

554
01:07:11,199 --> 01:07:13,120
Asset, are you on the move?

555
01:07:15,578 --> 01:07:17,909
Asset, your tracking device
says you're stationary.

556
01:07:18,706 --> 01:07:20,024
Are you moving?

557
01:07:20,124 --> 01:07:22,925
Heather, stay off this channel.
Let him do his job.

558
01:07:26,631 --> 01:07:27,632
Left here.

559
01:07:27,882 --> 01:07:30,473
- Get to Paddington Plaza, fast.
- Copy that.

560
01:08:13,261 --> 01:08:14,512
In position.

561
01:08:24,439 --> 01:08:25,650
Locked in.

562
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:45,752
What's going on?

563
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:47,093
What's that noise?

564
01:08:48,379 --> 01:08:50,130
Multiple fire alarms.

565
01:08:50,298 --> 01:08:51,719
That's Bourne.

566
01:08:55,595 --> 01:08:56,856
What do I do?

567
01:08:58,139 --> 01:09:00,060
You stay there. You do not move.

568
01:09:07,815 --> 01:09:10,526
Leave the building
by the nearest available exit.

569
01:09:12,195 --> 01:09:13,286
I can't stay here.

570
01:09:13,655 --> 01:09:15,014
You can't protect me.

571
01:09:15,114 --> 01:09:16,915
I need you to stay where you are, Smith.

572
01:09:17,450 --> 01:09:18,621
You still have line of sight?

573
01:09:20,912 --> 01:09:22,123
I'm on him.

574
01:09:22,288 --> 01:09:25,674
You're gonna shoot him in a crowd
when he's right next to me?

575
01:09:25,917 --> 01:09:27,418
Stay where you are, Smith.

576
01:09:27,752 --> 01:09:29,446
You know why he's here.

577
01:09:29,546 --> 01:09:30,707
He wants answers.

578
01:09:30,964 --> 01:09:32,055
You've lost this thing.

579
01:09:32,966 --> 01:09:34,047
I gotta get out of here.

580
01:09:41,516 --> 01:09:42,847
Shit!

581
01:09:51,901 --> 01:09:53,242
What the hell is going on?

582
01:09:53,403 --> 01:09:55,154
Bourne's got Smith.

583
01:10:13,882 --> 01:10:16,383
Go after them.
I'll come around and cut them off.

584
01:10:22,348 --> 01:10:23,500
Smith, we know you're with Bourne.

585
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,391
You have to find a way
to let us know where you are.

586
01:10:28,771 --> 01:10:30,522
Why are you taking me in here?

587
01:10:30,732 --> 01:10:32,113
They've got to be near the Plaza.

588
01:10:37,822 --> 01:10:39,203
Jesus, Bourne!

589
01:10:39,724 --> 01:10:41,325
God damn it!

590
01:10:42,535 --> 01:10:44,395
What are you doing? Take it easy.

591
01:10:44,495 --> 01:10:45,647
Richard Webb.

592
01:10:45,747 --> 01:10:47,524
Station Chief, Beirut.

593
01:10:47,624 --> 01:10:50,276
He was my father. He started Treadstone.

594
01:10:50,376 --> 01:10:52,654
He hired you to put me
under surveillance. Why?

595
01:10:52,754 --> 01:10:54,515
- Jesus!
- Why did he hire you?

596
01:10:54,631 --> 01:10:56,012
Don't say anything, Smith.

597
01:10:56,216 --> 01:10:57,677
No. No.

598
01:11:04,933 --> 01:11:05,934
There's no sign of them.

599
01:11:06,476 --> 01:11:07,557
What do you want us to do?

600
01:11:07,685 --> 01:11:09,295
Work your way down the canal.

601
01:11:09,395 --> 01:11:11,266
I'll circle around and meet you there.

602
01:11:15,568 --> 01:11:17,804
You followed me to Beirut.

603
01:11:17,904 --> 01:11:20,140
The last time I saw my father!

604
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:21,571
Why would he have you follow me?

605
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:23,991
It doesn't make any sense. Why?

606
01:11:24,202 --> 01:11:26,293
Don't give him a goddamn thing.

607
01:11:26,871 --> 01:11:27,962
Why?

608
01:11:36,756 --> 01:11:38,587
Jesus Christ, Bourne! I'm falling!

609
01:11:38,967 --> 01:11:40,493
Bourne, please!

610
01:11:40,593 --> 01:11:42,412
I can hear them!

611
01:11:42,512 --> 01:11:43,580
Beirut.

612
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,891
I went there to tell him
that Treadstone had approached me.

613
01:11:47,225 --> 01:11:50,314
But if it was his program,
why didn't he say anything to me?

614
01:11:51,396 --> 01:11:52,897
I've done something.

615
01:11:53,690 --> 01:11:55,071
Something...

616
01:11:56,776 --> 01:11:58,147
...that came at a cost.

617
01:12:02,615 --> 01:12:04,196
That was the day he was killed.

618
01:12:05,034 --> 01:12:06,915
They said he was killed by terrorists.

619
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,689
He wasn't killed by terrorists, was he?

620
01:12:09,789 --> 01:12:12,830
Think about your family's safety, Smith.
You keep your mouth shut.

621
01:12:13,626 --> 01:12:15,337
The next bullet's in your head!

622
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:17,593
Why was he killed?

623
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:19,507
Why?

624
01:12:21,092 --> 01:12:22,933
He was killed because of you.

625
01:12:26,306 --> 01:12:29,177
Your father, he wasn't in Operations.

626
01:12:29,601 --> 01:12:31,772
He didn't know we'd chosen you.
When he found out, he...

627
01:12:32,604 --> 01:12:34,756
He threatened to expose the program.

628
01:12:34,856 --> 01:12:37,437
He didn't want you turned into a killer.

629
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:46,621
Who killed him?

630
01:12:55,627 --> 01:12:56,778
Who killed him?

631
01:12:56,878 --> 01:12:58,209
Don't do it.

632
01:12:58,880 --> 01:12:59,881
Where is he?

633
01:13:02,008 --> 01:13:03,379
He's almost there.

634
01:13:07,430 --> 01:13:09,681
We're gonna stop this now.

635
01:13:11,142 --> 01:13:12,483
No, please.

636
01:13:30,370 --> 01:13:32,041
Somebody help! Call an ambulance!

637
01:13:33,122 --> 01:13:34,123
Someone help!

638
01:13:35,083 --> 01:13:37,084
He went off the roof. Five floors.

639
01:13:37,335 --> 01:13:38,836
He recognized me.

640
01:13:39,254 --> 01:13:41,345
I'm going to make sure it's finished.

641
01:13:46,761 --> 01:13:48,455
Help's coming now.

642
01:13:48,555 --> 01:13:49,766
No, don't get up, mate.

643
01:13:54,394 --> 01:13:55,855
Step aside, please. Step aside.

644
01:13:56,521 --> 01:13:57,839
Everybody step back.

645
01:13:57,939 --> 01:13:59,690
- Let us do our job.
- Please step back.

646
01:14:01,901 --> 01:14:03,011
Did anybody see what happened?

647
01:14:03,111 --> 01:14:04,095
He's gone.

648
01:14:04,195 --> 01:14:06,097
- Oh, shit.
- I'm going after him.

649
01:14:06,197 --> 01:14:07,818
I'll work my way down the canal.

650
01:14:09,742 --> 01:14:11,811
No. You're done in London.

651
01:14:11,911 --> 01:14:13,354
What are you talking about?

652
01:14:13,454 --> 01:14:15,045
There's another play to be made.

653
01:14:15,707 --> 01:14:18,193
Now that he knows what we did,
he'll come for both of us,

654
01:14:18,293 --> 01:14:21,134
and that could be the opportunity
for something else.

655
01:14:21,713 --> 01:14:22,947
This isn't about revenge.

656
01:14:23,047 --> 01:14:24,218
Yes, it is.

657
01:14:24,841 --> 01:14:27,052
And it won't be done until one of us is dead.

658
01:14:27,886 --> 01:14:29,829
Get to the airport.

659
01:14:29,929 --> 01:14:32,100
We have a problem with Iron Hand.

660
01:14:34,058 --> 01:14:35,229
Copy that.

661
01:14:43,735 --> 01:14:44,969
Give me a sit-rep.

662
01:14:45,069 --> 01:14:46,596
We've got nothing.

663
01:14:46,696 --> 01:14:47,987
Keep looking.

664
01:14:54,954 --> 01:14:56,335
Drive.

665
01:15:01,753 --> 01:15:02,987
It wasn't supposed to go like this.

666
01:15:03,087 --> 01:15:04,155
I wanted to talk.

667
01:15:04,255 --> 01:15:05,916
Where's Dewey going?

668
01:15:09,886 --> 01:15:13,832
He's going to Vegas to speak
with Aaron Kalloor at a cyber convention.

669
01:15:13,932 --> 01:15:16,668
The Agency recruits there every year.

670
01:15:16,768 --> 01:15:18,099
What's Iron Hand?

671
01:15:20,772 --> 01:15:22,063
Dewey's new black-ops program.

672
01:15:23,233 --> 01:15:25,260
Full-spectrum surveillance.

673
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,929
Watching everyone all the time.

674
01:15:28,029 --> 01:15:30,870
Dewey needs Kalloor's cooperation
to bring it online.

675
01:15:33,576 --> 01:15:34,577
Let me out.

676
01:15:36,913 --> 01:15:37,964
I can help you get there.

677
01:15:42,502 --> 01:15:43,633
Why would you do that?

678
01:15:43,753 --> 01:15:47,382
You and I have different reasons,
but we both want Dewey gone.

679
01:15:51,845 --> 01:15:52,896
Here, take this.

680
01:16:07,443 --> 01:16:08,994
I'll see you in Vegas.

681
01:16:34,179 --> 01:16:35,600
Sir.

682
01:16:36,306 --> 01:16:39,000
We're pinning Kalloor's hit
on a fictional jihadi shooter.

683
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,101
A 20-year-old Iraqi national.

684
01:16:41,269 --> 01:16:44,360
We created bank accounts,
travel documents, e-mails, phone records.

685
01:16:45,356 --> 01:16:46,508
He'll look like a lone wolf.

686
01:16:46,608 --> 01:16:47,779
Any physical evidence?

687
01:16:47,942 --> 01:16:51,073
The Asset leaves the gun.
It'll have the Iraqi's prints on it.

688
01:16:52,697 --> 01:16:54,908
Russell doesn't need to know about this.

689
01:16:57,535 --> 01:16:59,036
I understand, sir.

690
01:17:00,038 --> 01:17:01,709
Any news on Bourne?

691
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:03,081
Nothing.

692
01:17:05,126 --> 01:17:07,207
He was always gonna come for me.

693
01:17:09,923 --> 01:17:11,924
Well, if it happens, we'll deal with it.

694
01:17:49,045 --> 01:17:51,706
What was the purpose of your visit
to London, Mr. Michaels?

695
01:17:52,882 --> 01:17:54,383
Business.

696
01:18:19,617 --> 01:18:20,868
Welcome home, sir.

697
01:18:22,453 --> 01:18:23,454
Thank you.

698
01:18:38,928 --> 01:18:40,679
Parking lot clear. You're good to go.

699
01:18:45,143 --> 01:18:46,894
Sir, we have a secure room for you,
right upstairs.

700
01:19:48,039 --> 01:19:49,540
- Enjoy your stay.
- Thank you.

701
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:52,503
Hi, welcome to the Aria.

702
01:19:52,669 --> 01:19:54,800
- Heather Lee, checking in.
- Okay.

703
01:20:01,177 --> 01:20:03,888
We have you in a lovely Sky Suite.
Number 2016.

704
01:20:04,722 --> 01:20:05,790
Enjoy your stay.

705
01:20:05,890 --> 01:20:06,891
Thank you.

706
01:20:14,899 --> 01:20:16,480
Aaron!

707
01:20:19,237 --> 01:20:20,472
All right, Aaron!

708
01:20:20,572 --> 01:20:21,743
Deep Dream!

709
01:20:33,585 --> 01:20:35,487
Find Lee.

710
01:20:35,587 --> 01:20:37,798
Tell her I want to see her
before we go on stage.

711
01:20:37,922 --> 01:20:39,240
Yes, sir.

712
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,659
I want agents posted backstage
as well as the auditorium.

713
01:20:41,759 --> 01:20:42,890
Yes, sir.

714
01:20:52,770 --> 01:20:54,672
Coming through, make a hole.

715
01:20:54,772 --> 01:20:56,903
Make a hole, make a hole.

716
01:20:57,942 --> 01:20:59,302
Gonna make a quick stop here.

717
01:20:59,402 --> 01:21:02,013
Hey, guys. Hi. How's it going? Aaron.

718
01:21:02,113 --> 01:21:03,204
Good to meet you.

719
01:21:03,740 --> 01:21:04,871
Can I get one?

720
01:21:07,368 --> 01:21:08,789
Thanks very much for your hard work.

721
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,108
Thank you.

722
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:15,209
You're doing a great job.

723
01:21:46,491 --> 01:21:47,492
Yeah.

724
01:21:47,742 --> 01:21:49,123
You all set?

725
01:21:49,285 --> 01:21:51,312
Checking the departure route now.

726
01:21:51,412 --> 01:21:53,333
You won't have much time.

727
01:21:53,748 --> 01:21:56,999
They won't know where it came from.
I'll have enough time.

728
01:21:58,294 --> 01:22:01,072
After you take care of Kalloor,
I'll be standing, left hand at my side.

729
01:22:01,172 --> 01:22:02,213
You put a bullet in it.

730
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,381
It's better if I'm a target, too.

731
01:22:05,510 --> 01:22:06,721
Copy that.

732
01:22:46,384 --> 01:22:47,395
Lee.

733
01:22:50,054 --> 01:22:52,065
The Director wants a word
before you go on stage.

734
01:22:53,558 --> 01:22:54,849
Of course.

735
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:18,583
ID?

736
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:20,168
Thanks.

737
01:23:45,527 --> 01:23:46,528
Heather.

738
01:23:47,779 --> 01:23:50,410
My protégée. Strongest supporter.

739
01:23:51,115 --> 01:23:54,352
You know, after what happened in London,
I did not know what to do with you.

740
01:23:54,452 --> 01:23:59,424
I suppose we'll just, um,
write it off to your learning curve.

741
01:24:00,124 --> 01:24:01,545
I'd appreciate that.

742
01:24:02,794 --> 01:24:05,635
At least you can now see
that you never had a chance.

743
01:24:06,256 --> 01:24:09,033
When Bourne turns up again,
I'll deal with him.

744
01:24:09,133 --> 01:24:10,702
Do you understand?

745
01:24:10,802 --> 01:24:12,370
Of course.

746
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:14,101
I agree completely.

747
01:24:16,975 --> 01:24:18,526
When we get on stage,

748
01:24:18,643 --> 01:24:21,463
I'll handle all the policy questions,
throw everything technical to you.

749
01:24:21,563 --> 01:24:22,630
I'll be ready, sir.

750
01:24:22,730 --> 01:24:24,321
Okay, let's do this.

751
01:24:34,909 --> 01:24:36,160
Badges?

752
01:24:53,344 --> 01:24:54,395
Aaron.

753
01:24:55,346 --> 01:24:56,347
Robert.

754
01:24:58,183 --> 01:24:59,814
You know Heather Lee.

755
01:25:03,605 --> 01:25:05,906
Yeah, we went to Stanford together.

756
01:25:06,566 --> 01:25:09,147
Wow. How are you enjoying
life at the Agency?

757
01:25:09,402 --> 01:25:11,993
Challenging. But fulfilling.

758
01:25:12,822 --> 01:25:15,703
It's tough to stay true
to your principles over there?

759
01:25:16,201 --> 01:25:18,492
My principles are just fine, thanks.

760
01:25:19,871 --> 01:25:22,190
Gentlemen, we're ready for you.
Follow me, please.

761
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:23,291
I'm going to enjoy this.

762
01:25:24,626 --> 01:25:26,167
So am I.

763
01:25:39,724 --> 01:25:41,235
Thank you, sir.

764
01:26:02,413 --> 01:26:05,170
Oh! Hi! How's everybody doing tonight?

765
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:07,209
Welcome.

766
01:26:09,754 --> 01:26:11,095
Welcome.

767
01:26:12,590 --> 01:26:16,221
Welcome to tonight's EXOCON Symposium.

768
01:26:16,594 --> 01:26:20,475
We are so lucky to have
four fantastic guests this evening.

769
01:26:21,099 --> 01:26:24,390
The CIA Director, Robert Dewey, is here.

770
01:26:26,604 --> 01:26:30,175
And a dear friend of mine,
and an old friend of EXOCON,

771
01:26:30,275 --> 01:26:35,292
the CEO of social-media giant Deep Dream,
Aaron Kalloor is here.

772
01:27:08,271 --> 01:27:12,022
Tonight, "Policing a free Internet,

773
01:27:12,901 --> 01:27:15,822
"personal rights versus public safety."

774
01:27:16,154 --> 01:27:18,598
This is the great question of our time.

775
01:27:18,698 --> 01:27:21,529
And the choices we make about this
will determine our future.

776
01:27:22,285 --> 01:27:24,836
So let's just dive right in, okay?

777
01:27:26,623 --> 01:27:28,044
Come on out here, guys.

778
01:27:28,499 --> 01:27:30,860
Sir, you've got an incoming message.

779
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:31,961
High priority.

780
01:27:33,171 --> 01:27:34,781
All right, guys, I'm gonna have to take this.

781
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:36,991
I'll catch up with you later.

782
01:27:37,091 --> 01:27:38,597
Go ahead.

783
01:27:46,142 --> 01:27:47,853
Thanks for having me. Hey.

784
01:27:58,530 --> 01:28:00,932
It appears Director Dewey
is held up momentarily,

785
01:28:01,032 --> 01:28:04,543
and I am being told
that it shouldn't be too much longer.

786
01:28:04,661 --> 01:28:06,229
But we have a ton of stuff
to get into tonight,

787
01:28:06,329 --> 01:28:09,326
- so we can start anyway...
- Brad? Brad, could I say a few words?

788
01:28:09,791 --> 01:28:11,502
- Excuse me?
- Can I get the ball rolling?

789
01:28:11,668 --> 01:28:15,742
Oh, sure, man, by all means.
Ladies and gentlemen, Aaron Kalloor.

790
01:28:26,891 --> 01:28:27,932
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

791
01:28:29,227 --> 01:28:31,546
Thanks a lot to Brad
and all the folks at EXOCON

792
01:28:31,646 --> 01:28:35,195
for having us back,
and to you guys for turning out.

793
01:28:36,234 --> 01:28:38,803
Before the Director comes out to join us,

794
01:28:38,903 --> 01:28:41,574
I just wanted to share
a few words with you guys.

795
01:28:41,865 --> 01:28:44,246
A long time ago, I had this idea.

796
01:28:44,659 --> 01:28:47,228
- Copy that.
- A beautiful idea, to create a place, online...

797
01:28:47,328 --> 01:28:48,730
Facial recognition got a hit.

798
01:28:48,830 --> 01:28:50,857
Bourne was on a BA flight
from Heathrow to Vegas.

799
01:28:50,957 --> 01:28:52,458
It landed two hours ago.

800
01:28:53,501 --> 01:28:55,612
How the hell did he get through immigration?

801
01:28:55,712 --> 01:28:59,111
Someone issued him an Agency
security clearance on his passport.

802
01:29:00,675 --> 01:29:03,086
Well, it turned out to be
a pretty popular idea.

803
01:29:04,095 --> 01:29:06,506
People from around the world
started using our service.

804
01:29:18,818 --> 01:29:22,956
Well, first off, this has all made me
a lot more rich than is probably healthy.

805
01:29:23,072 --> 01:29:27,123
When I come on stage,
take care of Kalloor and the girl.

806
01:29:27,785 --> 01:29:29,406
Copy.

807
01:29:29,537 --> 01:29:31,022
But, what I mean to say is that, you know,

808
01:29:31,122 --> 01:29:33,123
all this success has come at a cost.

809
01:29:33,875 --> 01:29:37,096
There is a cancer at the heart of Deep Dream.

810
01:29:39,005 --> 01:29:41,186
A guilty secret, and, um...

811
01:29:42,217 --> 01:29:43,743
I have to share it with all of you guys.

812
01:29:43,843 --> 01:29:46,644
Son of a bitch is about to take us down.
Take out Kalloor and the girl right now.

813
01:29:51,726 --> 01:29:52,710
Whoa, whoa...

814
01:29:52,810 --> 01:29:54,481
- Stay there.
- Okay.

815
01:29:55,813 --> 01:29:57,984
When I was starting out, I, uh...

816
01:29:58,983 --> 01:30:01,324
I took money to start my company.

817
01:30:03,988 --> 01:30:05,909
Made a bargain with a guy in a dark suit...

818
01:30:09,118 --> 01:30:11,409
...and now he's come back to take my soul.

819
01:30:20,463 --> 01:30:21,406
I see the shooter!

820
01:30:21,506 --> 01:30:23,575
We've got eyes on Jason Bourne.

821
01:30:23,675 --> 01:30:25,186
He's still breathing. Call an ambulance!

822
01:30:25,343 --> 01:30:26,344
Go, go!

823
01:30:27,637 --> 01:30:29,508
- Let's go!
- Sir, we gotta go.

824
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:43,821
Head for the exit!

825
01:30:46,948 --> 01:30:48,699
This is Vasquez. We're on Bourne.

826
01:30:48,867 --> 01:30:50,028
Get the cars ready!

827
01:30:50,368 --> 01:30:52,329
Get the cars ready right now!

828
01:30:52,495 --> 01:30:53,772
No, take me to the suite.

829
01:30:53,872 --> 01:30:56,107
Sir, we've got to get you out of here.
Bourne is on the loose.

830
01:30:56,207 --> 01:30:59,402
You heard me. Take me to the suite.

831
01:30:59,502 --> 01:31:00,528
Yes, sir.

832
01:31:00,628 --> 01:31:02,614
Take him to the suite. Take him upstairs.

833
01:31:02,714 --> 01:31:03,765
Get him upstairs.

834
01:31:03,882 --> 01:31:04,883
Right now. Right now.

835
01:31:05,216 --> 01:31:06,217
Up to the suite.

836
01:31:06,885 --> 01:31:08,495
- Let's go, right now. Go, go, go!
- Yes, sir.

837
01:31:08,595 --> 01:31:12,106
Come this way. This way.
Don't worry. Come on.

838
01:31:16,769 --> 01:31:18,560
Out of the way! Federal agent!

839
01:31:26,738 --> 01:31:28,529
Vasquez, sit-rep.

840
01:31:28,948 --> 01:31:30,279
Vasquez, come in!

841
01:31:33,077 --> 01:31:34,078
Hey!

842
01:31:52,722 --> 01:31:54,853
Okay, we've got him. Sir, this is Collier.

843
01:31:55,016 --> 01:31:57,001
- We've ID'd the sniper.
- Shit.

844
01:31:57,101 --> 01:31:58,670
We're circulating his photo now.

845
01:31:58,770 --> 01:32:00,130
What about Bourne?

846
01:32:00,230 --> 01:32:02,191
Hang on.

847
01:32:02,315 --> 01:32:05,783
Okay, Bourne is just leaving the west
service corridor, heading for the lobby.

848
01:32:05,902 --> 01:32:07,613
Copy that. Stay on Bourne.

849
01:32:10,281 --> 01:32:11,349
What?

850
01:32:11,449 --> 01:32:14,698
We're still looking for Bourne.
And they've ID'd the Asset.

851
01:32:31,886 --> 01:32:34,038
Go back to the first floor
and wait for further instructions.

852
01:32:34,138 --> 01:32:35,719
- Yes, sir. Copy that.
- Copy that.

853
01:32:52,866 --> 01:32:55,027
Everybody down! Right now!

854
01:32:55,243 --> 01:32:56,624
Down, move, move, move!

855
01:32:58,162 --> 01:33:00,163
Out of the way! Federal agents! Move!

856
01:33:23,188 --> 01:33:26,019
Take a team to the northeast elevators.
I'll meet you up there.

857
01:33:33,823 --> 01:33:35,704
Bourne's on his way up to you.

858
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:28,211
You took a long time to get here, Jason.

859
01:34:29,254 --> 01:34:30,925
I know about Beirut.

860
01:34:31,756 --> 01:34:33,257
I know what you did.

861
01:34:34,801 --> 01:34:36,432
It all ends tonight.

862
01:34:37,011 --> 01:34:39,432
Be a lot easier to do it right away.

863
01:34:46,855 --> 01:34:48,506
You didn't come here for revenge.

864
01:34:48,606 --> 01:34:51,727
You came here because
you know it's time to come in.

865
01:34:59,325 --> 01:35:01,286
Your father created the program.

866
01:35:01,995 --> 01:35:04,689
Didn't have what it takes to make it work.

867
01:35:04,789 --> 01:35:06,040
And you did.

868
01:35:07,083 --> 01:35:08,464
You always did.

869
01:35:10,879 --> 01:35:12,447
That's why you volunteered.

870
01:35:12,547 --> 01:35:15,548
I volunteered because
I thought our enemies killed him.

871
01:35:17,051 --> 01:35:18,620
I volunteered because of a lie.

872
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,539
No, you volunteered because of who you are.

873
01:35:21,639 --> 01:35:23,875
You volunteered because
you are Jason Bourne,

874
01:35:23,975 --> 01:35:26,526
and not David Webb.

875
01:35:36,404 --> 01:35:38,075
Thirty-two kills, Jason.

876
01:35:38,489 --> 01:35:40,225
Every one of them made a difference.

877
01:35:40,325 --> 01:35:44,626
People all across this country
are safer because of what you did.

878
01:35:56,007 --> 01:35:57,838
I'm trying to find another way.

879
01:36:02,096 --> 01:36:04,307
And how's that working out for you?

880
01:36:12,106 --> 01:36:14,027
You're never going to find any peace.

881
01:36:15,735 --> 01:36:18,946
Not until you admit to yourself
who you really are.

882
01:36:21,199 --> 01:36:23,030
It's time to come in, Jason.

883
01:36:24,953 --> 01:36:26,374
It's time to come in.

884
01:36:33,002 --> 01:36:34,213
I can't.

885
01:36:39,551 --> 01:36:40,552
Not for you.

886
01:37:16,337 --> 01:37:17,838
You were never here.

887
01:37:25,722 --> 01:37:26,893
You don't have to go after him.

888
01:37:30,518 --> 01:37:31,889
This can stop now.

889
01:37:33,104 --> 01:37:34,815
You have a choice.

890
01:37:57,545 --> 01:37:59,126
- Let's go!
- Have your IDs ready.

891
01:37:59,422 --> 01:38:02,053
Have your IDs ready, ladies and gentlemen.

892
01:38:03,134 --> 01:38:05,895
Have your IDs ready!
Come on, guys, let's go, let's go!

893
01:38:12,810 --> 01:38:15,981
Stand in a line.
Las Vegas Police, ladies and gentlemen!

894
01:38:58,273 --> 01:39:01,092
BearCat SWAT truck
and unmarked black Dodge Charger

895
01:39:01,192 --> 01:39:02,448
stolen from the front of the Aria.

896
01:39:09,784 --> 01:39:11,895
Pursuit in progress. Air support requested.

897
01:39:11,995 --> 01:39:13,126
What was that ID?

898
01:43:25,081 --> 01:43:26,752
Stop him! Block that road!

899
01:43:30,086 --> 01:43:31,087
Oh, my God!

900
01:43:33,298 --> 01:43:34,299
Fire!

901
01:43:37,719 --> 01:43:38,720
Move out!

902
01:44:23,848 --> 01:44:24,849
Move!

903
01:44:28,186 --> 01:44:30,255
Next two units involved, identify.

904
01:44:30,355 --> 01:44:32,882
This is Air 1. Be advised, suspect vehicles

905
01:44:32,982 --> 01:44:34,943
have crashed into
the southeast entrance of the Riviera.

906
01:44:46,579 --> 01:44:49,925
We have an armed suspect heading
into the storm drain south of the Riviera.

907
01:46:39,776 --> 01:46:42,447
You're a traitor.
You've always been a traitor.

908
01:46:43,488 --> 01:46:44,819
It's in your blood.

909
01:48:08,907 --> 01:48:10,408
Mr. Kalloor!

910
01:48:11,910 --> 01:48:14,479
Aaron! What were you going
to tell everyone at the convention?

911
01:48:14,579 --> 01:48:16,147
What are you hiding, Aaron?

912
01:48:16,247 --> 01:48:17,248
Easy.

913
01:48:17,616 --> 01:48:19,943
Why did somebody try to assassinate you?

914
01:48:20,043 --> 01:48:22,254
What's the cancer at the heart
of Deep Dream?

915
01:48:22,378 --> 01:48:24,864
I think it would be inappropriate
to pass any comment at this stage,

916
01:48:24,964 --> 01:48:26,866
but I look forward to
working with the authorities

917
01:48:26,966 --> 01:48:28,535
to find out who was responsible.

918
01:48:28,635 --> 01:48:29,828
And to getting back to Deep Dream,

919
01:48:29,928 --> 01:48:32,259
where we can continue
our important work. Thank you.

920
01:48:33,097 --> 01:48:34,928
Have you been lying to your users?

921
01:49:06,714 --> 01:49:07,725
Sir.

922
01:49:17,767 --> 01:49:19,478
I wanted to say I'm sorry, sir.

923
01:49:20,353 --> 01:49:21,984
About Vegas.

924
01:49:22,188 --> 01:49:25,925
Director Dewey's tactics were unwise.

925
01:49:26,025 --> 01:49:27,436
Unwise?

926
01:49:28,278 --> 01:49:30,989
We're still trying to come up with
a narrative to explain what happened.

927
01:49:31,531 --> 01:49:35,532
That son of a bitch put
a spotlight on Iron Hand.

928
01:49:36,286 --> 01:49:37,812
On all of us.

929
01:49:37,912 --> 01:49:39,963
Kalloor hasn't gone public yet.

930
01:49:41,749 --> 01:49:42,960
I know Aaron.

931
01:49:44,085 --> 01:49:46,166
There are still moves we can make with him.

932
01:49:49,299 --> 01:49:50,510
Tell me.

933
01:49:51,134 --> 01:49:54,015
Dewey's problem was
that he belonged in the past.

934
01:49:55,680 --> 01:49:57,681
People like Kalloor are shaping the future.

935
01:49:58,641 --> 01:50:00,062
These are my people.

936
01:50:01,436 --> 01:50:03,597
I know how to deal with him.

937
01:50:06,524 --> 01:50:08,445
And what do you want?

938
01:50:09,360 --> 01:50:11,262
When you appoint a new Agency Director,

939
01:50:11,362 --> 01:50:14,283
you're going to need someone
working for your interests.

940
01:50:15,491 --> 01:50:16,662
Someone

941
01:50:17,827 --> 01:50:20,078
empowered by you.

942
01:50:23,666 --> 01:50:24,707
What about Bourne?

943
01:50:26,252 --> 01:50:28,503
You still think you can bring him in?

944
01:50:31,299 --> 01:50:32,760
I have his trust.

945
01:50:33,718 --> 01:50:34,889
After what we went through.

946
01:50:36,971 --> 01:50:38,373
I'll bring him in.

947
01:50:38,473 --> 01:50:40,224
I'm certain of it.

948
01:50:42,560 --> 01:50:44,441
And if you can't?

949
01:50:46,022 --> 01:50:49,653
Then he'll have to be put down.

950
01:50:53,404 --> 01:50:55,575
It's an interesting proposal.

951
01:51:00,620 --> 01:51:02,001
You can pull over here.

952
01:51:06,876 --> 01:51:11,377
Of course, if you decide that you
don't need me, then that's not a problem.

953
01:51:12,048 --> 01:51:15,179
There are many other agencies
who would want what I know.

954
01:51:44,956 --> 01:51:46,457
I brought you something.

955
01:51:52,088 --> 01:51:56,185
It's a cast from your father's star,
on the Memorial Wall at Langley.

956
01:52:06,477 --> 01:52:08,268
I'm sorry for what happened to you.

957
01:52:11,149 --> 01:52:12,550
How you were treated.

958
01:52:12,650 --> 01:52:15,261
But the people that did that are gone,

959
01:52:15,361 --> 01:52:18,890
and things are changing at the Agency.

960
01:52:18,990 --> 01:52:20,571
What is it you want?

961
01:52:23,912 --> 01:52:25,753
I know you've always been a patriot.

962
01:52:27,540 --> 01:52:30,331
That what happens to this country
matters to you.

963
01:52:31,878 --> 01:52:33,799
We need you to help protect us.

964
01:52:35,465 --> 01:52:36,766
Come back in.

965
01:52:38,927 --> 01:52:40,718
And we'll work together.

966
01:52:48,645 --> 01:52:50,156
Let me think about it.

967
01:52:51,397 --> 01:52:52,818
How will I find you?

968
01:53:39,320 --> 01:53:41,451
You still think you can bring him in?

969
01:53:41,573 --> 01:53:43,244
I have his trust.

970
01:53:43,992 --> 01:53:45,663
After what we went through.

971
01:53:46,703 --> 01:53:47,874
I'll bring him in.

972
01:53:48,538 --> 01:53:50,039
I'm certain of it.

973
01:53:50,999 --> 01:53:52,780
And if you can't?

974
01:53:54,460 --> 01:53:57,711
Then he'll have to be put down.
