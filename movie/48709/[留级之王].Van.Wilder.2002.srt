1
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:47,267
Coolidge College
was established in 18--

2
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:49,860
Who knows this?
It was in your freshman facts.

3
00:00:49,972 --> 00:00:53,430
The first day of spring semester.

4
00:00:53,542 --> 00:00:55,601
A time to say good-bye
to the parents once again...

5
00:00:55,711 --> 00:00:58,703
and say hello
to a few new student bodies.

6
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,110
As for me, well...

7
00:01:04,219 --> 00:01:08,451
I like to start off each semester
with a certain time-honored tradition.

8
00:01:08,557 --> 00:01:10,923
A ritual, if you will,
that allows me...

9
00:01:11,026 --> 00:01:13,290
to get my head in the right place.

10
00:01:18,867 --> 00:01:22,359
Okay, so Suk Mee's a little old...

11
00:01:23,605 --> 00:01:26,199
but she is just so damn good.

12
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,742
She's great with these quick jobs...

13
00:01:30,846 --> 00:01:33,974
plus there is no substitute
for decades of experience.

14
00:01:34,082 --> 00:01:36,812
That looks amazing.

15
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:40,145
That is perfect. You're a pro.

16
00:01:40,255 --> 00:01:41,654
A pro.

17
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:44,322
Look at me.

18
00:01:44,426 --> 00:01:45,723
Pro.

19
00:01:47,596 --> 00:01:50,861
Well, gosh, that was great.
Thanks for the quick job there.

20
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:55,434
I need these in 20 minutes.

21
00:01:56,972 --> 00:01:58,269
Super.

22
00:02:15,624 --> 00:02:18,457
We've got a jumper!

23
00:02:32,641 --> 00:02:35,474
Hold on, son.
You don't want to do this.

24
00:02:35,577 --> 00:02:39,104
I didn't want to come here either.
They made me come!

25
00:02:39,214 --> 00:02:40,738
They made me!

26
00:02:42,884 --> 00:02:45,717
First year can be kind of scary,
can't it, Timmy?

27
00:02:45,821 --> 00:02:48,346
My name's not--

28
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:51,722
But you know what I've learned
in my seven years here at Coolidge...

29
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:53,385
Timmy?

30
00:02:53,495 --> 00:02:56,589
I've learned that you can't treat every
situation as a life-and-death matter...

31
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:58,563
because you'll die
a lot of times.

32
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:01,664
Write that down.

33
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,331
- I don't have a pen.
- Well, remember that then.

34
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,840
And you know something, Timmy?

35
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:12,340
I think you've got the balls
to make it here.

36
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,347
Call me nuts...

37
00:03:15,617 --> 00:03:17,517
but I believe in you.

38
00:03:20,022 --> 00:03:23,082
You see, Timmy, you can't let this
lead you all the time.

39
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:26,251
Sometimes you've gotta heed this.

40
00:03:26,361 --> 00:03:29,853
I think you've got a lot of heart
in there, mister, don't you?

41
00:03:31,033 --> 00:03:33,501
Don't you?
I mean, look around you.

42
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:39,298
Timmy?

43
00:03:43,111 --> 00:03:45,079
Great work, Van. Thanks!

44
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,114
Remember my credo, Timmy.

45
00:03:47,215 --> 00:03:50,082
Don't be a fool.
Stay in school.

46
00:03:53,622 --> 00:03:55,681
God, I love this place.

47
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:59,726
Hey, Van. Hey, Van the man.

48
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:01,853
I called you last night, Van.

49
00:04:05,901 --> 00:04:09,132
My name is Van Wilder,
and this is my home...

50
00:04:09,237 --> 00:04:10,602
Coolidge College.

51
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:23,881
The last, well, seven years
have gone by way too fast.

52
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:28,388
This school's given me so much.
I just can't seem to give enough back.

53
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:31,391
- That's Van.
- That's him!

54
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,559
Oh, my God!

55
00:04:34,663 --> 00:04:37,063
- Wow.
- Yeah. Wow.

56
00:04:44,773 --> 00:04:47,333
I was the first-ever male cheerleader
at Huntington High!

57
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:49,501
The first ever!

58
00:04:50,445 --> 00:04:53,073
Give me a V! Give me an A!

59
00:04:53,181 --> 00:04:55,775
Give me an N!
What does it spell?

60
00:04:55,884 --> 00:04:59,615
I see a rabbi, and he's
performing a circumcision...

61
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:01,211
on himself though.

62
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,683
You'll become disciplined.

63
00:05:04,793 --> 00:05:06,624
Your mind will become a weapon.

64
00:05:18,974 --> 00:05:21,568
I'm sorry. You really
just don't fit the profile.

65
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:26,808
We're just gonna do
a little bit of word association.

66
00:05:26,915 --> 00:05:28,382
Cookies!

67
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,182
- My name is Van.
- Hi, my name is Terry.

68
00:05:38,493 --> 00:05:40,927
Let's get it started then,
shall we?

69
00:05:55,243 --> 00:05:56,642
Big finish.

70
00:05:59,981 --> 00:06:01,175
Medic.

71
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:04,446
- Having us both at the same time...
- Will definitely lighten your load.

72
00:06:04,553 --> 00:06:07,545
- We will bend over backwards for you.
- There's nothing too big...

73
00:06:07,656 --> 00:06:09,851
- we can't handle.
- And we mean nothing.

74
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:13,223
- We'll stay on top of you...
- And ride you all semester.

75
00:06:13,328 --> 00:06:14,989
Basically, we're saying we won't
blow the job, Van.

76
00:06:20,101 --> 00:06:23,468
By the way, can you tell me if
there'll be any international travel?

77
00:06:25,574 --> 00:06:28,509
Seriously, I swear to God,
I'm really uncomfortable now.

78
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,668
It's time you should go.

79
00:06:36,718 --> 00:06:39,243
Not one acceptable candidate.

80
00:06:39,354 --> 00:06:41,481
What is wrong
with the youth of today?

81
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,286
The Internet, dude.

82
00:06:45,393 --> 00:06:47,987
Fries their brain cells, man.

83
00:06:49,097 --> 00:06:51,327
It's cool, Colossus.
We'll find somebody.

84
00:06:51,433 --> 00:06:53,333
C-los, get your ass off my shirt.

85
00:06:59,641 --> 00:07:01,575
You really should
have him neutered, man.

86
00:07:01,676 --> 00:07:03,109
That's up to him.

87
00:07:03,211 --> 00:07:05,771
They are getting bigger,
aren't they?

88
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:09,678
I'll get that.

89
00:07:13,622 --> 00:07:15,283
Looks like we got one more.

90
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,921
What's your name?

91
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:28,628
I'm Taj Mahal Badalandabad.

92
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:30,534
Where are you from, Taj?

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,200
I'm an exchange student
from Banglapur, India.

94
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:37,039
Welcome.
What can we do for you?

95
00:07:38,246 --> 00:07:41,579
My exchange program culminates
at the end of this school year...

96
00:07:41,683 --> 00:07:44,379
at which time I must return
to my home country...

97
00:07:44,486 --> 00:07:47,216
where I do not have many friends.

98
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:50,951
I would like very much to spend my
remaining days here as your assistant.

99
00:07:51,059 --> 00:07:53,493
Okay. We're just gonna do
a little word association.

100
00:07:53,595 --> 00:07:55,893
Say the first thing
that comes to your mind. Milk.

101
00:07:55,997 --> 00:07:57,555
Tit!

102
00:07:57,666 --> 00:07:59,463
Oh, Mommy.

103
00:07:59,568 --> 00:08:01,729
Most Indians would say "cow"
because they are sacred...

104
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:04,737
but I hear ”milk,"
I think giant jugs.

105
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:07,239
You see, I cannot
go home a virgin.

106
00:08:07,342 --> 00:08:10,869
I came here to study the great
American art of muff diving.

107
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,510
To smack clam, munch rug...

108
00:08:14,616 --> 00:08:17,380
dine at just one American
pink taco stand.

109
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:20,852
You know, I wanted to-- how is it--
park the porpoise.

110
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:24,187
I want to take it
through the car wash, baby.

111
00:08:24,292 --> 00:08:27,386
And get it waxed.
I want to wax it. Wax it!

112
00:08:27,495 --> 00:08:29,759
You know, and air dry.

113
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:32,264
Air dry that shit, yeah.

114
00:08:32,367 --> 00:08:36,201
And I would like to be
your assistant very much...

115
00:08:36,304 --> 00:08:38,272
Mr. Van Wilder.

116
00:08:38,373 --> 00:08:40,603
You'll need a copy of my class schedule
so you can take notes.

117
00:08:40,709 --> 00:08:42,074
You'll also handle my finances.

118
00:08:42,177 --> 00:08:44,270
I lecture at the freshman crisis group
every other Monday.

119
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,347
I'm spearheading the Save
the Swim Team Speedo Spectacular...

120
00:08:46,448 --> 00:08:48,609
and the Bloated Belly Beer Bash
to Battle Bulimia this semester.

121
00:08:48,717 --> 00:08:51,277
This is Sick Boy's room. Not a week's
gone by he hasn't had an ailment.

122
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:53,786
Shingles, hepatitis, crabs.
That was his fault.

123
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:56,516
- Matzo ball soup. Jewish penicillin.
- Thanks, Van.

124
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,525
Don't pick at it.
Moving on.

125
00:08:58,627 --> 00:09:01,755
I'm moving my 7:15 to 8:15,
my 8:15 to 9:45...

126
00:09:01,863 --> 00:09:03,854
and my 9:45 till Wednesday.

127
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:05,865
You owe $75,000 for the speed boat.

128
00:09:05,967 --> 00:09:07,867
Cancel my guest lecture
at the Wharton School next week.

129
00:09:07,969 --> 00:09:10,631
I feel like going somewhere tropical.
Tahiti. Are you writing this down?

130
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,969
- Yes, sir.
- You owe $200,000 for the thoroughbred.

131
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:16,043
Schedule a massage after my golf game
tomorrow afternoon.

132
00:09:16,144 --> 00:09:18,305
- With a happy ending?
- Ah, yes.

133
00:09:18,413 --> 00:09:22,372
And another $39,000 for your son's
tuition and housing this semester.

134
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:25,544
Tuition?
Van is still in school?

135
00:09:25,654 --> 00:09:27,383
For the better part of a decade.

136
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,854
"Depression:
Is Prozac really the answer?"

137
00:09:34,963 --> 00:09:36,863
"Famine-- Crisis in Rwanda."

138
00:09:36,965 --> 00:09:38,865
"Tracking Tuition:
Where does our money really go?"

139
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:42,562
Each article well-written and researched
by our own Gwen Pearson...

140
00:09:42,671 --> 00:09:46,937
and each article skipped over
by the majority of the student body.

141
00:09:47,042 --> 00:09:49,533
I don't care.
I won't pander to them.

142
00:09:53,615 --> 00:09:57,608
"Lite Beer vs. Dark-- The Showdown"
by Darius Grayson.

143
00:09:57,719 --> 00:10:00,347
- Is that the same--
- Pulitzer-prize winning Darius Grayson.

144
00:10:00,455 --> 00:10:02,355
He was an alumnus
of our journalism staff.

145
00:10:02,457 --> 00:10:05,756
He wrote his best stuff in detox.
Still does, I'm told.

146
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:09,489
I have got a very challenging
assignment for you.

147
00:10:09,597 --> 00:10:11,724
A story that nobody's
been able to get.

148
00:10:11,833 --> 00:10:14,700
- About what?
- No, no. It's about whom.

149
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,450
It does not look good.

150
00:10:33,555 --> 00:10:35,682
That's the end of the first half...

151
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,782
and the Chickadees will need
a miracle to come back and score.

152
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,161
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step away from Van's vehicle.

153
00:10:51,272 --> 00:10:52,432
Wilder!

154
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,906
He's got no business parking there.
That's my spot.

155
00:10:56,745 --> 00:10:58,645
They need me, Ted.

156
00:11:01,783 --> 00:11:05,241
This is the first time in my life
I'm glad I'm deaf!.

157
00:11:05,353 --> 00:11:08,982
I can't hear the boos!
Now, listen up.

158
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,684
I'm only gonna go over this
one more time.

159
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,819
In the event they switch
to a zone defense...

160
00:11:14,929 --> 00:11:17,762
we must swing the ball
around the perimeter.

161
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:21,836
This ball club is the heart
of this institution.

162
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:24,928
You win, it beats.
You lose, it breaks.

163
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:27,530
You're not boxing out, Big Papa.
You're my Windex man.

164
00:11:27,642 --> 00:11:29,337
I want you shining glass.

165
00:11:29,444 --> 00:11:31,036
We gotta D up out there.
Darius.

166
00:11:31,146 --> 00:11:34,047
I want you all over that ball
like a fat kid on a cupcake.

167
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:36,709
What are you looking at? Your mom
said you left your legs at home.

168
00:11:36,818 --> 00:11:38,945
For God's sake!

169
00:11:39,053 --> 00:11:41,783
I'd do anything for you guys...

170
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:43,824
which is why I'm throwing you
a little soiree tomorrow night...

171
00:11:43,925 --> 00:11:45,620
but not without a W tonight.

172
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:49,128
You want to know why?
Nobody wants to celebrate a loss, guys.

173
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:51,721
Hey, man, you gonna invite
those freak honeys from Mt. Holyoke?

174
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:54,495
I already did.

175
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:57,594
They said they'd try to make it
if they weren't humping the Matadors.

176
00:11:57,705 --> 00:12:00,173
- The Matadors?
- What?

177
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:04,242
Come on.
We got a ball game to win.

178
00:12:07,882 --> 00:12:10,612
Let's go kick some Matador tail--

179
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:35,404
How bad do you wanna be...

180
00:12:36,611 --> 00:12:37,600
a Delta?

181
00:12:37,712 --> 00:12:40,180
Would you walk on broken glass?

182
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:43,273
Let the shards tear
into your Achilles tendon...

183
00:12:43,384 --> 00:12:45,409
causing acute achondroplasia...

184
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:48,512
which could lead to non-congenital
dwarfism as you got older?

185
00:12:49,624 --> 00:12:52,684
Ease up on the medical terms.
Just keep it simple and terrifying.

186
00:12:52,794 --> 00:12:57,288
Gordon, there are very few things more
terrifying than non-congenital dwarfism.

187
00:12:57,398 --> 00:13:00,765
Hey, Richard.
Ready to study?

188
00:13:00,869 --> 00:13:03,963
Gwenny, I said 9:30.
It's 9:20.

189
00:13:04,072 --> 00:13:06,506
I'm in the middle
of an 80-year tradition here.

190
00:13:08,877 --> 00:13:12,210
I will be up when I'm done with
my presidential responsibilities.

191
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:14,281
Okay, I'll wait for you upstairs.

192
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,317
Who's my alabaster princess?

193
00:13:19,254 --> 00:13:21,381
You are. You are.

194
00:13:24,726 --> 00:13:27,456
Relax, guys.
They're just Doritos.

195
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,464
Listen to me,
you little fuck stains!

196
00:13:30,565 --> 00:13:34,433
When I count to three, you will jump
or be banished from this house forever!

197
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:37,003
One, two--

198
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:43,168
Fuck!

199
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,532
Excuse me.
Where can I find Van Wilder?

200
00:14:08,636 --> 00:14:11,537
In the Guiness Book
of World-fucking-Records, man...

201
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,107
under "Raddest fucking dude alive"!

202
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,199
Okay. Thanks.

203
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:18,336
In any one of these three rooms,
Gramps.

204
00:14:31,459 --> 00:14:34,292
Sweet Joseph,
my son's a fairy.

205
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:38,126
Dad, what are you doing here?

206
00:14:38,967 --> 00:14:41,458
- Thank God.
- No jammies.

207
00:14:41,569 --> 00:14:45,061
- Party foul.
- No, don't-- Oh, dear God.

208
00:14:45,173 --> 00:14:47,403
Next time you'll know better.

209
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,974
Seven years, and no degree.
You should have graduated twice by now.

210
00:14:56,084 --> 00:14:57,813
I've done a lot in seven years.

211
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,149
If you don't have your doctorate,
you haven't done enough.

212
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:02,814
But you have wasted enough
of your time and my money.

213
00:15:02,924 --> 00:15:06,121
Pack up your panties, son,
because we are headin' home.

214
00:15:10,832 --> 00:15:13,232
I'm staying here with my friends.

215
00:15:13,334 --> 00:15:16,792
Fine. Maybe your friends
can pay your tuition.

216
00:15:16,904 --> 00:15:20,340
Because this morning I placed
a stop payment on this semester's check.

217
00:15:20,441 --> 00:15:21,908
I'm sorry, son.

218
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:25,502
Sometimes in life you have to
realize a poor investment...

219
00:15:25,613 --> 00:15:27,103
and cut your losses.

220
00:15:29,117 --> 00:15:31,483
Write that down.

221
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:45,631
I need more time.

222
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:47,633
There's got to be something
that we can work out.

223
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:51,631
What is that intoxicating scent
you're wearing, Doris?

224
00:15:51,739 --> 00:15:54,003
I have cats.

225
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:56,008
Meow!

226
00:15:59,414 --> 00:16:02,713
Maybe you could put me
on some sort of extension...

227
00:16:04,152 --> 00:16:05,710
program?

228
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:09,381
- A little pay-as-you-go?
- Are you trying to seduce me?

229
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:12,823
Who, me? No!

230
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,802
You know, maybe this isn't
such a good idea.

231
00:16:22,904 --> 00:16:25,566
Being bad seldom is.

232
00:16:35,316 --> 00:16:37,443
Oh, yeah.

233
00:16:37,552 --> 00:16:39,850
That's the shit.

234
00:16:39,954 --> 00:16:42,752
Guess what. I'm feeling
a little cold sore coming on.

235
00:16:42,857 --> 00:16:46,020
Maybe we shouldn't do this
for three to six weeks.

236
00:16:46,127 --> 00:16:50,359
Shut up, bitch,
and give me some sugar.

237
00:17:01,042 --> 00:17:04,842
Fill this out. It's a standard
payment plan extension form.

238
00:17:06,147 --> 00:17:09,275
You mean, we didn't have to--

239
00:17:09,383 --> 00:17:12,113
But aren't you glad we did?

240
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,733
You can either mail this in
or drop it off.

241
00:17:27,835 --> 00:17:29,063
Go, baby, go!

242
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,900
Mail it in!

243
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,800
Mail it in! Mail it in.

244
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:39,073
Van, you must make four
monthly payments of $5,000 each.

245
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,705
I'm sorry, Taj.
I'm gonna have to let you go.

246
00:17:41,816 --> 00:17:45,217
I don't have the resources
to pay for your services anymore.

247
00:17:45,319 --> 00:17:47,310
A good soldier
does not leave his commander...

248
00:17:47,421 --> 00:17:50,481
just because he lies wounded,
arms torn off at the sockets...

249
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,458
intestines spilling out onto the mud,
picked at by the birds.

250
00:17:53,561 --> 00:17:55,552
I will stay on at no charge.

251
00:17:55,663 --> 00:17:57,392
Okay.

252
00:17:57,498 --> 00:17:59,557
Exactly how much money do you have?

253
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:01,897
- He has only $34.
- Damn, Van!

254
00:18:02,003 --> 00:18:04,995
What the hell you gonna do
with $34, man?

255
00:18:36,904 --> 00:18:40,772
Congratulations, Taj!
Your first blow job.

256
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:44,038
In my country, a woman's mastery
of her gastronomical releases...

257
00:18:44,145 --> 00:18:45,772
is the ultimate aphrodisiac.

258
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:49,043
Desiree is the foremost connoisseur
of chili con carne...

259
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,344
and a TA at Coolidge.

260
00:18:50,451 --> 00:18:52,316
I wish I had teachers like that.

261
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,947
And just like that,
Topless Tutors was born.

262
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:59,219
X...

263
00:18:59,327 --> 00:19:02,592
equals... six?

264
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:03,629
Yeah!

265
00:19:05,199 --> 00:19:06,860
We knew you could do it.

266
00:19:06,968 --> 00:19:09,163
Desi told me how she
and a few of her grad school pals...

267
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,329
could use some extra income.

268
00:19:11,439 --> 00:19:13,669
Taj proved to be
an excellent company accountant...

269
00:19:13,774 --> 00:19:16,436
as well as our most valued client.

270
00:19:27,388 --> 00:19:29,049
Excuse me.

271
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,522
I'm looking for information
on a current student here, Van Wilder.

272
00:19:39,967 --> 00:19:42,094
Freshman year.
I'll get the others.

273
00:19:42,203 --> 00:19:45,866
- Wait. There are more of these?
- Actually, there are many more.

274
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:48,771
It seems Mr. Wilder didn't quite
come out of his shell...

275
00:19:48,876 --> 00:19:51,106
until mid-sophomore year.

276
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:54,046
Thanks.

277
00:19:57,351 --> 00:19:59,945
It's like this itchy,
rashy burning sensation.

278
00:20:00,054 --> 00:20:02,147
And it hurts when I--

279
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,085
- Dance?
- When I pee.

280
00:20:07,194 --> 00:20:09,059
- You hooked up with a burner.
- Yeah.

281
00:20:09,163 --> 00:20:11,723
She seemed like a nice girl,
said it was her first time?

282
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:14,562
Always check the quality of the turf
before you step onto the field.

283
00:20:14,669 --> 00:20:17,536
Listen, go to the campus hospital,
see Stu.

284
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:21,130
Tell him Van sent you, and remember--
Don't be a fool. Wrap your tool.

285
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:22,732
Thanks, Van. Thanks a lot.

286
00:20:22,843 --> 00:20:24,811
Don't thank me.
Thank penicillin.

287
00:20:26,681 --> 00:20:30,014
Crazy kids with their crazy VD.

288
00:20:31,852 --> 00:20:34,252
- You must be Van.
- Hi.

289
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:37,422
I'm Gwen Pearson,
staff writer for The Liberator.

290
00:20:40,461 --> 00:20:43,988
Okay, look, that old bag
is stronger than she looks.

291
00:20:44,098 --> 00:20:47,192
I'm doing a human
interest piece on you.

292
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:50,099
I'm flattered.
I'd love for your piece to be on me.

293
00:20:52,139 --> 00:20:55,040
But sadly I don't do interviews.
Never have, never will. I do lunch.

294
00:20:55,142 --> 00:20:57,372
My editor did say
this would be a challenge.

295
00:20:57,478 --> 00:20:59,469
Van, second date with Emily.

296
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,344
Blue. Brings out your eyes. Kid's got
killer eyes, not unlike yourself.

297
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,714
- Has anyone told you that before?
- Yes, my boyfriend.

298
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:07,521
Is it true that this is
your seventh year at Coolidge?

299
00:21:07,621 --> 00:21:10,021
Carry the two--
Yes, that's correct.

300
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:12,183
So what's your boyfriend's name?
Does he go to school here?

301
00:21:12,293 --> 00:21:14,352
- Does he appreciate you?
- That's none of your business.

302
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:16,692
You know what? You're right.

303
00:21:18,733 --> 00:21:22,134
His name's Richard.
He's premed.

304
00:21:22,236 --> 00:21:24,136
Van, you have a 1:30
with the swim team.

305
00:21:24,238 --> 00:21:25,569
On it.

306
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:27,800
- You have an assistant?
- Yes, I do.

307
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:32,308
Is there anything you
can tell me about yourself...

308
00:21:32,413 --> 00:21:34,881
that I haven't already found out
from your public records?

309
00:21:34,982 --> 00:21:37,143
I'll be at the quad tomorrow night
at 10:00. Sound good?

310
00:21:37,251 --> 00:21:40,652
- It's a date.
- It's an interview, not a date.

311
00:21:43,324 --> 00:21:45,986
Gwen, first dates are interviews.

312
00:21:47,762 --> 00:21:49,821
You going out tonight?

313
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:53,559
Rob's coming over.
I'm closing in on that diamond, Gwen.

314
00:21:53,667 --> 00:21:55,999
The dynamic duo
will seal the deal tonight.

315
00:21:56,103 --> 00:21:58,003
Good luck, ladies.

316
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:04,433
Somebody got awfully dressed up
to quiz me on my anatomy midterm.

317
00:22:04,545 --> 00:22:07,343
I'm so sorry, baby.
I totally forgot.

318
00:22:07,448 --> 00:22:10,008
- I have an interview for the paper.
- At 10:00 at night?

319
00:22:10,117 --> 00:22:13,348
Can't you postpone it?
Gwen, first exam-- most crucial.

320
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:16,855
It's not like you're on a deadline
for the Boston Globe.

321
00:22:16,957 --> 00:22:19,926
It's the only time he had available.
I'll call you as soon as I get back.

322
00:22:20,027 --> 00:22:21,517
Bye.

323
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,353
He?

324
00:22:29,804 --> 00:22:32,705
All right. Gwen, all right!
You're just in time.

325
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:34,775
- Take your clothes off.
- I'm not taking off my clothes.

326
00:22:34,875 --> 00:22:39,107
It is the Naked Mile Run. Everybody
else is in their birthday suit.

327
00:22:40,581 --> 00:22:42,048
Except that guy.

328
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:46,481
- I have a few questions for you.
- In time. This is gonna be fun.

329
00:22:46,587 --> 00:22:48,714
You know that three-letter word
that starts with F?

330
00:22:48,823 --> 00:22:51,792
So you're quite the campus man,
heading events like the Jäger Olympics.

331
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:55,123
Yes, well, you haven't lived...

332
00:22:55,229 --> 00:22:57,163
until you've shot putted
blitzed on Jäger.

333
00:22:57,264 --> 00:23:00,062
- Heinie?
- This was a really bad idea.

334
00:23:01,502 --> 00:23:03,902
Are we gonna reschedule or what?

335
00:23:14,114 --> 00:23:16,014
Who's a big boy?

336
00:23:17,518 --> 00:23:19,748
Oh, God!

337
00:23:19,854 --> 00:23:21,981
Those things
could raise the Titanic.

338
00:23:23,757 --> 00:23:25,054
You Van Wilder?

339
00:23:25,159 --> 00:23:27,593
The strip club owner got tired
of using his B squad...

340
00:23:27,695 --> 00:23:30,596
so he came back
for the starting lineup.

341
00:23:30,698 --> 00:23:32,427
Topless Tutors was dead.

342
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:36,763
We are truly up the Ganges River
without a bamboo oar.

343
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:39,601
We're still $1,200 short
of your next tuition payment.

344
00:23:39,707 --> 00:23:43,268
Taj, I learned a long time ago
that worrying is like a rocking chair.

345
00:23:43,377 --> 00:23:45,675
It gives you something to do,
but it doesn't get you anywhere.

346
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:47,337
Write that down.

347
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:49,712
Don't even sweat it, Taj.
I've got a plan.

348
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:52,914
- Let's go get fucked up.
- Sounds good.

349
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,487
Is that all you think about?

350
00:23:54,588 --> 00:23:56,351
I admit I applied for this job...

351
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:59,187
because I wanted to cut loose
and shake my rump...

352
00:23:59,293 --> 00:24:01,818
but I do not believe that this dilemma
will be solved by partying.

353
00:24:05,799 --> 00:24:07,630
Can I help you, son?

354
00:24:08,435 --> 00:24:10,335
I certainly hope so, Mr. Wilder.

355
00:24:10,437 --> 00:24:12,371
I come to you in desperation.

356
00:24:12,473 --> 00:24:16,807
I'm Panos Patakos, president
of the Lambda Omega Omega fraternity.

357
00:24:16,911 --> 00:24:19,971
I'm sure you're aware
of our... stigma.

358
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:23,243
Yeah, you guys have had
the best GPA the last 50 years.

359
00:24:24,251 --> 00:24:26,242
Indeed, but believe it or not...

360
00:24:26,353 --> 00:24:28,583
the best GPA doesn't get you laid.

361
00:24:28,689 --> 00:24:31,123
- Damn well should.
- Amen.

362
00:24:31,225 --> 00:24:34,661
This month marks
our 75th anniversary.

363
00:24:34,762 --> 00:24:38,323
I am here to ask you to aid us
in throwing a party...

364
00:24:38,432 --> 00:24:40,332
a party we can be proud of...

365
00:24:40,434 --> 00:24:43,335
a party people will
actually show up to.

366
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:47,237
Gosh, I'd really love to help, but I
have a bamboo oar stuck up my Gangees.

367
00:24:47,341 --> 00:24:48,933
It's very scary stuff.

368
00:24:49,043 --> 00:24:50,943
I just don't have the time.

369
00:24:52,279 --> 00:24:54,474
How much is your time worth?

370
00:24:56,183 --> 00:24:58,242
Panos reminded me that I had one...

371
00:24:58,352 --> 00:25:00,479
very valuable skill
I'd yet to tap--

372
00:25:00,588 --> 00:25:04,422
my undeniable ability
to throw one hell of a party.

373
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:12,030
I was hanging on by a thread,
but I was still making tuition.

374
00:25:15,703 --> 00:25:18,171
The strawberry! Eat the strawberry!
It's worth 250!

375
00:25:18,272 --> 00:25:21,537
- Don't you think I know that?
- You treat me like a child.

376
00:25:21,642 --> 00:25:23,542
I don't like the way you
condescend me.

377
00:25:23,644 --> 00:25:25,544
- Don't do that!
- Frankly, you're juvenile.

378
00:25:25,646 --> 00:25:27,204
Guys.

379
00:25:27,314 --> 00:25:29,214
I know Ms. Pac Man's special.

380
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:32,444
She's fun. She's cute.
She swallows.

381
00:25:32,553 --> 00:25:34,646
But we gotta talk, guys.

382
00:25:34,755 --> 00:25:37,724
Huddle up. Come on.
Team meeting here.

383
00:25:37,825 --> 00:25:40,521
Cowboy. All right.

384
00:25:40,628 --> 00:25:42,528
I look at you guys,
and you know what I see?

385
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:45,224
A collective GPA of 52,000?

386
00:25:45,332 --> 00:25:46,629
Yeah! No!

387
00:25:46,734 --> 00:25:48,998
I see a bunch of party animals...

388
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:51,333
crouched in attack position,
ready to strike.

389
00:25:51,438 --> 00:25:52,803
Am I right?

390
00:25:53,974 --> 00:25:55,407
No one even knows we're here.

391
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:58,842
Au contraire, mon frères.
Girls!

392
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:03,176
I'd like you to meet
Sherri and Terri.

393
00:26:03,283 --> 00:26:05,843
Two girls utterly infatuated...

394
00:26:05,953 --> 00:26:08,513
with men who have
larger than normal...

395
00:26:08,622 --> 00:26:10,852
medulla oblongatas.

396
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:20,523
Pearson, I got a hot news tip for you.
It's Friday night. Get out of here.

397
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:23,933
I know. I'm just doing some final
revisions to this piece on euthanasia.

398
00:26:24,038 --> 00:26:26,438
Oh, I read that.
Made me want to kill myself.

399
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,768
I'm kidding.

400
00:26:27,875 --> 00:26:30,036
- Where's my Wilder story?
- There is no story, Elliot.

401
00:26:30,144 --> 00:26:33,375
The guy's a joke. He tries to turn
every interview into a date.

402
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,778
A good writer gets her story
no matter what.

403
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:40,718
Please get me the Wilder piece.
He's throwing a big party tonight.

404
00:26:40,821 --> 00:26:43,119
You should be there.

405
00:26:50,564 --> 00:26:53,362
- This is really a pimpin' good time.
- Yes, it is.

406
00:26:55,836 --> 00:26:59,567
Look who's checking out
the Badalandabad. Her name's Naomi.

407
00:26:59,673 --> 00:27:02,073
That's "I moan" backwards.

408
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:06,974
I put in a good word for you.

409
00:27:07,081 --> 00:27:09,811
Hey, Tajy. Let's boogie.

410
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:32,202
These are the most pathetic
bunch of pledges.

411
00:27:32,306 --> 00:27:33,898
You picked 'em.

412
00:27:35,776 --> 00:27:37,676
Hey, babe.

413
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:40,406
- Why aren't you in costume?
- I can't stay. I have to work tonight.

414
00:27:40,514 --> 00:27:42,414
You're gonna miss
the biggest party of the year.

415
00:27:44,218 --> 00:27:46,152
Well, I gotta go.

416
00:27:46,253 --> 00:27:48,744
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- What?

417
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:50,756
This party so rocks, Richard.

418
00:27:50,858 --> 00:27:54,089
- This party sucks rectum, Jeannie.
- Okay.

419
00:27:56,363 --> 00:27:58,263
Where the hell is everyone?

420
00:27:58,365 --> 00:28:00,663
Mad props
for this pimpin' good time...

421
00:28:00,768 --> 00:28:02,861
go out to those
hung and handsome bad boys...

422
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:04,870
of Lambda Omega Omega.

423
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:08,766
Thanks for the good time, fellas.

424
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:22,350
- Let's get you some skates.
- I'm not here to skate.

425
00:28:22,456 --> 00:28:24,617
For some reason,
my editor thinks you're a story.

426
00:28:24,725 --> 00:28:26,249
What do you think?

427
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,227
As a story, I think...

428
00:28:29,329 --> 00:28:30,626
you're a little soft.

429
00:28:30,731 --> 00:28:34,599
Wow, all this time I thought I was more
to you than just some flaccid story.

430
00:28:35,502 --> 00:28:37,402
A dilemma has arose up front.

431
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,405
- Don't know if we got our point across.
- Crystal clear, guys.

432
00:28:40,507 --> 00:28:42,975
- This is incredible.
- 100 percent. Don't go anywhere.

433
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:45,567
Seriously.
Van is a godsend.

434
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,409
I would have paid him way more
than a grand for this party.

435
00:28:48,515 --> 00:28:50,676
I would have cashed in
my Israel bonds.

436
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:53,719
- How do you put a price on dignity?
- How do you put a price on poonani?

437
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:56,255
- Yes!
- Oh, God!

438
00:28:57,491 --> 00:28:59,391
Oh, my God. Feel it!

439
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,825
Whoa. Trick or treat.
What's going on?

440
00:29:06,934 --> 00:29:10,097
This vaginal discharge
won't let us partake in the party.

441
00:29:10,204 --> 00:29:11,603
Graphic.

442
00:29:11,705 --> 00:29:14,003
I'm sure we can accommodate
a few more, yeah?

443
00:29:14,107 --> 00:29:16,871
No can do.
We're at maximum capacity.

444
00:29:20,881 --> 00:29:22,849
- What are you doing here?
- You two know each other?

445
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:24,577
That's my girlfriend,
gluteous erecti.

446
00:29:24,685 --> 00:29:27,415
- You must be premed Dick.
- Yeah, that's right.

447
00:29:27,521 --> 00:29:30,718
- What's it to you?
- Thanks for the story.

448
00:29:30,824 --> 00:29:31,882
What story?

449
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:33,889
Brilliant, Pearson.

450
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:36,224
I have been inundated
with people telling me...

451
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:38,457
how much they enjoy
reading about this guy.

452
00:29:38,565 --> 00:29:41,363
They want more, and so do I.
I want you to do a follow-up.

453
00:29:41,468 --> 00:29:43,698
I did your story, Elliot.
I'm not doing another one.

454
00:29:43,804 --> 00:29:46,170
Even if I tell you it's gonna be on the
front page of the graduation issue...

455
00:29:46,273 --> 00:29:47,535
in two months?

456
00:29:49,676 --> 00:29:52,577
And I quote,
"Van Wilder is a party pimp."

457
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:55,580
Sick Boy.
Can you believe she wrote that?

458
00:29:55,682 --> 00:29:58,708
Van Wilder's phone.
I do not foresee that to be a problem.

459
00:29:58,819 --> 00:30:01,447
And that guy she's with--
all kinds of wrong for her.

460
00:30:01,555 --> 00:30:05,321
- Sick Boy, how are you doing?
- Van, the shingles are all gone.

461
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,759
That ointment really worked.

462
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:09,226
Thanks.

463
00:30:09,329 --> 00:30:11,229
Lookin' good there, buddy.

464
00:30:17,037 --> 00:30:19,301
- He'll call you back.
- Unbelievable.

465
00:30:19,406 --> 00:30:21,840
Van Wilder's phone.

466
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:25,002
- Terrible.
- I think so. Yeah.

467
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:27,137
- Hang on.
- Unbelievable.

468
00:30:27,247 --> 00:30:29,613
Van's room.
Saturday night, yeah.

469
00:30:29,716 --> 00:30:32,412
That's-- How did you--
From the paper?

470
00:30:32,519 --> 00:30:35,181
Yeah, that's fine!
Okay, thanks.

471
00:30:35,289 --> 00:30:37,519
- No problem confirming. Bye.
- This writing, it's just--

472
00:30:38,892 --> 00:30:41,884
I was just wondering if you could...
slam the door in my face.

473
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:43,758
Van, you must listen to me.

474
00:30:43,864 --> 00:30:47,493
Because of her article, everybody wants
to have a party thrown by Van Wilder...

475
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:49,296
the party liaison.

476
00:30:49,403 --> 00:30:51,769
Your cash camel has arrived!

477
00:30:55,909 --> 00:30:57,809
We need to talk.

478
00:31:00,314 --> 00:31:02,714
This is why I don't do interviews.
You totally slammed me.

479
00:31:02,816 --> 00:31:05,216
You journalists
and your irresponsible reporting.

480
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:08,288
I recorded quotes that you got money
from the Lambdas to throw them a party.

481
00:31:08,388 --> 00:31:11,186
Recorded? What are you, bugged?
Do I need to frisk you?

482
00:31:11,291 --> 00:31:13,282
Why is my story
such a big deal to you?

483
00:31:13,393 --> 00:31:16,260
Because I didn't want the students
to know I threw the party.

484
00:31:16,363 --> 00:31:19,560
They paid me, but that's not
the only reason I did it.

485
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:22,897
Lambdas are cool in their own right.
People just needed to realize it.

486
00:31:23,003 --> 00:31:26,461
I'm sorry. I didn't know
you had a benevolent agenda.

487
00:31:26,573 --> 00:31:28,905
There's two sides
to every story, Gwen.

488
00:31:29,009 --> 00:31:31,409
I have a chance to make front page
of the graduation issue...

489
00:31:31,511 --> 00:31:33,775
which is a huge deal to me.

490
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,246
Let me get the other side.

491
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,614
There's this function
I'm hosting tomorrow night.

492
00:31:38,719 --> 00:31:41,779
If you want...
you could tag along.

493
00:31:41,888 --> 00:31:44,118
- I'll be there.
- It's a date.

494
00:31:44,224 --> 00:31:46,784
It's an interview.

495
00:31:46,893 --> 00:31:48,918
Remember, today's assignment
is about shadow.

496
00:31:49,029 --> 00:31:51,156
So don't get too hung up
on detail.

497
00:31:51,264 --> 00:31:53,164
All right, everybody?

498
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:55,097
Oh, Lord!

499
00:31:57,304 --> 00:32:00,398
So much sinew,
I need a bigger pencil.

500
00:32:00,507 --> 00:32:02,441
8:30 p.m.
Yeah, that's fine.

501
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:07,938
Word spread around campus. My calendar
was filled with parties to plan.

502
00:32:08,048 --> 00:32:11,609
Van Wilder, party liaison, was born.

503
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:15,854
At the Hillel House, I broke bread.

504
00:32:15,956 --> 00:32:17,856
And then I broke the boredom.

505
00:32:21,862 --> 00:32:25,298
They said I did them a mitzvah.
That's Yiddish for "good deed."

506
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:27,867
Write that down.

507
00:32:27,968 --> 00:32:30,459
Oh, yeah, she came too.

508
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:37,067
This is the second party
of his she's gone to.

509
00:32:37,177 --> 00:32:38,542
Sounds serious. Threatened?

510
00:32:40,647 --> 00:32:42,877
Threatened? Please.

511
00:32:44,518 --> 00:32:47,851
I'm president of both my fraternity
and the student government.

512
00:32:48,855 --> 00:32:51,289
He's nothing more
than a mild rectal itch.

513
00:32:52,759 --> 00:32:54,750
You know what you do
about a mild rectal itch, Gordo?

514
00:32:54,861 --> 00:32:56,954
- What's that, Richard?
- You scratch it.

515
00:32:57,064 --> 00:32:58,998
Then you scratch it some more.

516
00:32:59,099 --> 00:33:00,999
The more you scratch at it,
the worse it gets...

517
00:33:01,101 --> 00:33:04,662
until finally you have nothing left
but a raw, chafed...

518
00:33:04,771 --> 00:33:07,672
possibly infected anal cavity.

519
00:33:08,775 --> 00:33:10,140
Then it's won.

520
00:33:10,243 --> 00:33:14,009
When all you had to do from the start
was take a medicated pad...

521
00:33:15,782 --> 00:33:16,942
and smother it.

522
00:33:22,089 --> 00:33:24,580
All right, people,
midterm is next week.

523
00:33:26,293 --> 00:33:28,193
Here you have your five categories--

524
00:33:28,295 --> 00:33:31,196
commerce and trade,
so forth and so on.

525
00:33:31,298 --> 00:33:33,061
What you doing?

526
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,897
I'm in the middle of class.
You know, that five-letter word.

527
00:33:37,003 --> 00:33:39,972
I thought we could spend
some time together...

528
00:33:40,073 --> 00:33:42,371
for the story.

529
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:45,810
I want you to have this.

530
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:50,141
- Yeah.
- And thank you.

531
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,481
All right, things to remember--
commerce and trade--

532
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:56,420
Everybody just file out
in an orderly fashion.

533
00:34:05,398 --> 00:34:07,832
What? Come on. Hop in.

534
00:34:07,934 --> 00:34:09,834
I am not getting
in that thing with you.

535
00:34:09,936 --> 00:34:12,302
If you want the story,
you'll get in this thing with me.

536
00:34:14,774 --> 00:34:16,674
What happened?
Is everyone okay?

537
00:34:21,848 --> 00:34:22,906
Wilder.

538
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,545
Are we gonna get in trouble
for being in here?

539
00:34:27,654 --> 00:34:30,589
It's cool. Equipment manager owes me
a favor. I introduced him to his wife.

540
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,056
Life is all about
developing relationships, Gwen.

541
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:35,754
I hope you can skate.

542
00:34:36,930 --> 00:34:39,592
So the deal is, I score...

543
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:42,259
you cooperate
and answer all my questions?

544
00:34:42,369 --> 00:34:44,837
- I miss--
- Dinner for two, me and you.

545
00:34:45,705 --> 00:34:47,104
Clothing optional.

546
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:11,688
Come on!

547
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:20,063
Holy crap.

548
00:35:39,759 --> 00:35:42,728
My brothers play hockey...

549
00:35:42,829 --> 00:35:44,729
for the Rangers.

550
00:35:45,899 --> 00:35:48,367
My dad just didn't see me
as a sound investment anymore.

551
00:35:48,468 --> 00:35:52,404
But he gave up on me and my mom
long before I ever came here.

552
00:35:54,608 --> 00:35:56,735
Maybe seven years of tuition...

553
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:59,277
is a good way to remind him
that you're still angry.

554
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:04,745
So how long have you
and premed Richard been together?

555
00:36:04,851 --> 00:36:08,082
- Since my freshman year.
- I bet he's a tighty whitey guy.

556
00:36:08,188 --> 00:36:11,180
- Excuse me?
- White, elastic band, constrictive.

557
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,555
You can tell a lot about a person
by the kind of drawers they wear.

558
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,150
Like you. Granny panties, I bet.

559
00:36:15,262 --> 00:36:17,753
Does that allude to me
being the plain, boring type?

560
00:36:18,965 --> 00:36:21,195
I just wanted a visual.

561
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:24,202
I think it takes a lot more than
the kind of underwear one wears...

562
00:36:24,304 --> 00:36:25,965
to define them as a person.

563
00:36:27,073 --> 00:36:28,506
Like what?

564
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:30,508
Like their actions.

565
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:32,510
For instance, most people...

566
00:36:32,612 --> 00:36:35,308
want to get out of school
so they can make money.

567
00:36:35,415 --> 00:36:38,384
You're trying to make money
to stay in school.

568
00:36:39,486 --> 00:36:41,886
- Why?
- I like it here.

569
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:46,188
What about your future?

570
00:36:46,293 --> 00:36:50,662
- You take life way too seriously.
- Life is serious.

571
00:36:50,764 --> 00:36:53,494
I used to party with this guy
who once told me...

572
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,728
"Don't take life too seriously.
You'll never get out alive."

573
00:36:59,506 --> 00:37:01,736
He used to write
for the school paper.

574
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:05,004
He kept babbling about the differences
between light and dark beer.

575
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:09,846
Very strange, but good advice.

576
00:37:09,949 --> 00:37:14,010
You think about the future too much,
you kinda forget about the present...

577
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,088
obviously.

578
00:37:16,189 --> 00:37:19,420
And I am really enjoying
the present right now...

579
00:37:19,526 --> 00:37:22,654
sharing a penalty box and a tri-latte
with Gwen Pearson...

580
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:26,425
who believes censorship reflects
society's lack of confidence in itself.

581
00:37:26,533 --> 00:37:28,660
You actually read that article?

582
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:32,465
Okay, look, I read the damn article,
but don't tell anyone...

583
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:35,006
because if word gets out that I read,
my reputation--

584
00:37:35,108 --> 00:37:37,941
shot to hell.

585
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:44,910
She's smart, she's beautiful...

586
00:37:45,018 --> 00:37:46,918
she can skate.

587
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:50,717
She's not for you, dude.
She's too high-strung.

588
00:37:50,824 --> 00:37:52,951
Besides, babes that fine--

589
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:55,994
they're way into themselves
and shit.

590
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:00,292
After this weekend,
we should have sufficient funds...

591
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,300
to cover your next two payments.

592
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:04,563
I mean, this girl is dynamite.

593
00:38:06,473 --> 00:38:08,532
Too bad she's dating
Strapper John, MD.

594
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:16,614
- Where did you find that?
- In your room a few days ago.

595
00:38:16,716 --> 00:38:19,947
I'm trying to spark this bong,
but this damn thing won't light.

596
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:22,851
That's no bong!
It's for my schlong!

597
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:29,989
Hold on.

598
00:38:30,096 --> 00:38:32,257
You mean I put my mouth
on your cock pump?

599
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,758
Oh, damn!

600
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,171
I have a date with Naomi
tomorrow night...

601
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:45,210
and I just wanted
to bring my A game.

602
00:38:45,311 --> 00:38:49,748
Taj, come on!
That's what I'm here for, right?

603
00:38:49,849 --> 00:38:51,908
Now, follow my foolproof plan...

604
00:38:52,018 --> 00:38:55,078
and I'm gonna help you put
the bang in Banglapur.

605
00:38:55,855 --> 00:38:58,050
All you need are the three
fundamentals-- scented candles...

606
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:01,484
massage oil...

607
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:03,221
and Barry White.

608
00:39:03,329 --> 00:39:05,559
Write that down.

609
00:39:05,665 --> 00:39:08,896
- Hey, no cock pump.
- No cock pump.

610
00:39:09,002 --> 00:39:10,401
Barry White.

611
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:14,302
- I'm gonna go wash my hands now.
- Oh, Gwen!

612
00:39:14,407 --> 00:39:18,241
Your labia feels so good
around my swollen phallus.

613
00:39:20,547 --> 00:39:22,447
I'm fairly confident
I'm going to ejaculate.

614
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:25,211
I'm releasing my seminal fluids
inside of you now!

615
00:39:39,065 --> 00:39:40,965
Are you okay?

616
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:44,269
Yeah. Why?

617
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:48,436
Didn't you--

618
00:39:48,541 --> 00:39:50,441
It's kinda hard in 15 seconds.

619
00:39:51,411 --> 00:39:52,708
Damn it!

620
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:57,911
You know the kind of pressure
I'm under with my exams.

621
00:39:59,752 --> 00:40:01,845
- I'm sorry.
- Look, I'm sorry.

622
00:40:01,955 --> 00:40:04,753
This semester's marks could determine
the next ten years of our lives.

623
00:40:04,858 --> 00:40:06,758
Do you realize that?

624
00:40:08,628 --> 00:40:10,186
You know...

625
00:40:10,296 --> 00:40:13,390
you shouldn't take life
too seriously.

626
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,400
You'll never get out alive.

627
00:40:19,772 --> 00:40:22,434
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

628
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:28,406
I'm late for my study group.

629
00:40:37,056 --> 00:40:39,786
She was getting awfully chummy
with the rectal itch.

630
00:40:39,893 --> 00:40:42,453
Son of a bitch.
Disappear!

631
00:40:42,562 --> 00:40:44,462
Yes, superior leader, sir.

632
00:40:48,067 --> 00:40:50,365
It's time to excise
that cancerous lump.

633
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:53,633
Forget him. Let's crap in the chapter
room and make the pledges clean it up.

634
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,300
- It'll be fun.
- I wish I could, Gordo.

635
00:40:56,409 --> 00:40:58,809
I got dinner
at Gwen's parents' house.

636
00:40:58,912 --> 00:41:01,073
Sounds special.
Is Wilder gonna be there?

637
00:41:02,382 --> 00:41:04,646
Hey, guys. Hey, Richard.

638
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:06,651
Is there anything
I can do for you today?

639
00:41:12,325 --> 00:41:14,054
Dear Van--

640
00:41:19,365 --> 00:41:21,492
Here you go, Taj.
Get your rave on, man.

641
00:41:21,601 --> 00:41:22,898
- Thanks.
- You got it.

642
00:41:23,002 --> 00:41:27,063
"See you tonight. Gwen."
The invite to the parents' house.

643
00:41:27,173 --> 00:41:30,074
This is big.
This is very, very big.

644
00:41:30,176 --> 00:41:32,167
- Doesn't she have a boyfriend?
- Details.

645
00:41:32,278 --> 00:41:34,473
I'm off.
Taj, you're in charge.

646
00:41:34,581 --> 00:41:37,345
I do not think I'm capable
of handling such a responsibility.

647
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:40,681
Listen to me. Do you know why
I chose you as my assistant?

648
00:41:40,787 --> 00:41:43,221
So you could teach me
how to muff dive?

649
00:41:44,057 --> 00:41:46,525
Well, yeah, but also...

650
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:48,753
because you have the potential
to be great.

651
00:42:07,313 --> 00:42:09,372
- May I help you?
- Yeah, I'm Van--

652
00:42:10,483 --> 00:42:12,383
You made it.

653
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:15,113
Evelyn, this is one of your daughter's
acquaintances from school.

654
00:42:15,221 --> 00:42:16,916
There's room for one more?

655
00:42:17,023 --> 00:42:19,719
By all means.
Come in, please.

656
00:42:22,862 --> 00:42:26,491
Definitely be out of the question
unless they all agreed with us...

657
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:29,193
and we talked it over.

658
00:42:31,104 --> 00:42:32,264
Excuse me, gentlemen.

659
00:42:33,373 --> 00:42:35,967
Excuse me, gentlemen.

660
00:42:36,075 --> 00:42:38,805
Van, this is Dr. Henke,
proctologist.

661
00:42:38,911 --> 00:42:42,745
Oh, well, holy crap.
I hope you're not on call tonight.

662
00:42:44,017 --> 00:42:46,076
Dr. Beaverman, OB-GYN.

663
00:42:46,185 --> 00:42:48,517
Van Wilder,
G-L-A-D to meet you.

664
00:42:50,156 --> 00:42:51,646
And of course, Gwen's father.

665
00:42:51,758 --> 00:42:53,749
I'm gonna go out on a limb here.

666
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:55,589
Dr. Pearson?

667
00:42:55,695 --> 00:42:58,129
- Indeed.
- Indeed. Super.

668
00:42:58,231 --> 00:43:01,826
All right.
So... am I here for a physical?

669
00:43:01,934 --> 00:43:05,461
'Cause I'm gonna need a few cocktails
before I start coughing for you fellas.

670
00:43:12,945 --> 00:43:16,381
- What are you doing here?
- I don't know.

671
00:43:16,482 --> 00:43:18,245
No, thank you.

672
00:43:18,351 --> 00:43:21,047
Mr. Wilder here
is quite the collegian.

673
00:43:21,154 --> 00:43:23,384
He's in his, what, sixth year?

674
00:43:23,489 --> 00:43:25,389
Lucky number seven, actually.

675
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:29,293
- What are you studying, son?
- I dabble in a bit of everything.

676
00:43:29,395 --> 00:43:32,489
I've tried to experience
all that Coolidge has to offer.

677
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:34,498
Surely you have a career in mind.

678
00:43:35,501 --> 00:43:37,128
Not really.

679
00:43:37,236 --> 00:43:39,363
I'm still looking for that
dare-to-be-great situation.

680
00:43:39,472 --> 00:43:42,737
Maybe you should start looking for
that dare-to-be-employed situation.

681
00:43:42,842 --> 00:43:44,935
The student body
finds Van so intriguing...

682
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:47,410
that my editor has asked me
to do an exposé on him...

683
00:43:47,513 --> 00:43:48,980
for the school newspaper.

684
00:43:49,082 --> 00:43:51,209
Isn't that wonderful?

685
00:43:51,317 --> 00:43:53,785
- That will be quite the page-turner.
- It'll be a very well-written article.

686
00:43:53,886 --> 00:43:56,218
Gwen is an extremely gifted
journalist.

687
00:43:56,322 --> 00:43:58,813
Are you and Richard
in the same fraternity?

688
00:43:58,925 --> 00:44:00,415
Oh, no.

689
00:44:00,526 --> 00:44:04,155
Van isn't exactly
Delta Iota Kappa material.

690
00:44:04,263 --> 00:44:07,596
Richard, you rascal, you never
told me that you were a DIK.

691
00:44:08,935 --> 00:44:10,903
Not that you had to.

692
00:44:11,738 --> 00:44:13,831
I'm gonna go get
another bottle of champagne.

693
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:16,170
- Richard, will you help me open it?
- Sure.

694
00:44:22,448 --> 00:44:23,847
Wow.

695
00:44:23,950 --> 00:44:26,441
If he's here,
who's running Hell?

696
00:44:28,454 --> 00:44:31,082
- What are you doing out there?
- Proving a point.

697
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,591
Your friend doesn't fit in.
He's a virus, and I'm the vaccine.

698
00:44:34,694 --> 00:44:37,492
- I can't believe you're doing this.
- Pop quiz. True or false.

699
00:44:37,597 --> 00:44:41,294
You and that GDI have been spending
an inordinate amount of time together.

700
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,595
True. Now here's a multiple choice
question for you.

701
00:44:43,703 --> 00:44:46,729
You're A, an asshole; B, an asshole
who isn't staying at my place tonight...

702
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:49,535
- or C, all the above?
- What's B again?

703
00:44:49,642 --> 00:44:53,100
Gwenny, I'm kidding.
I apologize.

704
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:55,874
- Gwenny, where are you going?
- To go save Van.

705
00:44:55,982 --> 00:44:59,110
God only knows what my parents and
their stuck-up friends are doing to him.

706
00:45:06,993 --> 00:45:09,120
Okay! All right!

707
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:12,220
You're a natural, Dr. P.
Hey, what are you looking at?

708
00:45:12,331 --> 00:45:15,300
- Henke, you're up. Come on.
- All right.

709
00:45:16,836 --> 00:45:19,134
Easy, sailor.

710
00:45:42,461 --> 00:45:45,692
All right, Wilder, let's dance.

711
00:45:45,798 --> 00:45:47,629
It's a good day to die, McDoogle.

712
00:45:49,535 --> 00:45:51,560
Oh, yes.

713
00:46:15,394 --> 00:46:17,362
Jesus! Criminy!

714
00:46:17,463 --> 00:46:20,296
What happened to you, Wilder?
Don't think I don't remember.

715
00:46:20,399 --> 00:46:22,560
You got an A
in my freshman economics class.

716
00:46:22,668 --> 00:46:24,568
You remember one thing--

717
00:46:24,670 --> 00:46:27,730
Apathy is the glove
into which evil slips its hand.

718
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,740
I'll write that down.

719
00:46:29,842 --> 00:46:32,402
You do that.
You're not fooling anybody!

720
00:46:32,511 --> 00:46:34,536
You're only fooling yourself!.

721
00:46:43,456 --> 00:46:46,823
- Why don't you walk?
- I think I'll walk from here.

722
00:46:49,695 --> 00:46:52,755
Are you stalking me?
Because that would be super.

723
00:46:52,865 --> 00:46:55,766
My mom did want me to invite you
to her Tupperware party next week.

724
00:46:56,869 --> 00:46:58,666
Was that a--

725
00:46:58,771 --> 00:47:00,398
Judges' ruling.

726
00:47:00,506 --> 00:47:03,669
Uh-huh. Yeah.
I do believe that was a joke.

727
00:47:09,115 --> 00:47:12,141
I want to apologize for what
Richard did the other night.

728
00:47:12,251 --> 00:47:15,015
It was a really immature stunt.

729
00:47:15,121 --> 00:47:17,419
Yeah, I know...

730
00:47:17,523 --> 00:47:20,515
but sometimes guys can do
some pretty childish things.

731
00:47:24,597 --> 00:47:26,224
Let us proceed.

732
00:48:01,734 --> 00:48:04,669
- Is he ready?
- Ah, yeah, he's ready.

733
00:48:04,770 --> 00:48:06,169
It's go time.

734
00:48:17,149 --> 00:48:18,844
Such a good boy.

735
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:22,250
Oh, stop for a second.
Stop.

736
00:48:23,522 --> 00:48:25,012
Okay. Keep going.

737
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:37,592
For the love of God.

738
00:48:37,703 --> 00:48:39,102
Smile, buddy.

739
00:48:45,811 --> 00:48:47,278
Lovely.

740
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,644
It's all about presentation,
gentlemen.

741
00:48:57,623 --> 00:49:00,524
Well, I'll be damned!

742
00:49:00,626 --> 00:49:02,821
Poor guy just needed
a little TLC.

743
00:49:09,101 --> 00:49:11,934
I got it, guys.
No problem whatsoever.

744
00:49:14,707 --> 00:49:17,107
Let the damn baby
have his ball back.

745
00:49:20,046 --> 00:49:21,946
Thank you, brothers.

746
00:49:23,816 --> 00:49:26,614
It's not like he can see
out of it anyway.

747
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:28,084
Loser.

748
00:49:33,959 --> 00:49:35,859
Awesome work, sisters.

749
00:49:40,166 --> 00:49:41,531
Special delivery!

750
00:49:43,035 --> 00:49:46,061
- Time out.
- What the fuck, Jeannie?

751
00:49:46,172 --> 00:49:49,539
"From the sisters of Sigma Theta Tau."
Dig in, guys.

752
00:49:55,915 --> 00:49:58,145
Oh, they're still warm.

753
00:50:01,754 --> 00:50:04,018
- So creamy.
- They're awesome.

754
00:50:09,995 --> 00:50:12,395
Oh, they're so creamy.

755
00:50:13,999 --> 00:50:16,058
God, these are excellent.

756
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:18,864
Guys? Richard?

757
00:50:23,109 --> 00:50:25,339
Think I've had these before.

758
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:34,082
Oh, my God!

759
00:50:38,591 --> 00:50:40,684
I love this song.

760
00:50:40,793 --> 00:50:42,658
I know.

761
00:50:42,761 --> 00:50:45,423
It is the White Barry.

762
00:50:49,201 --> 00:50:50,930
Is that for me?

763
00:50:51,036 --> 00:50:52,970
I long to rub you the right way.

764
00:50:53,072 --> 00:50:56,701
You're such a bad
little Badalandabad.

765
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,617
No harm, no foul.

766
00:51:09,555 --> 00:51:13,116
- Are you all right?
- Never better, my jasmine flower.

767
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:33,811
That feels so good.

768
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:41,912
Oh, my God.

769
00:51:46,325 --> 00:51:48,054
Take me.

770
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:50,025
I want you now.

771
00:51:50,129 --> 00:51:51,892
Now!

772
00:51:51,997 --> 00:51:53,931
Shit!

773
00:51:54,967 --> 00:51:56,195
Don't tease me.

774
00:52:06,612 --> 00:52:09,513
This is the culmination
of my being.

775
00:52:09,615 --> 00:52:13,142
Baby, I'm about to culminate.
Now, get over here.

776
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,251
Tajy, I'm so hot.

777
00:52:16,355 --> 00:52:19,153
- I feel on fire.
- Oh, yeah, me too, baby.

778
00:52:19,258 --> 00:52:21,624
- Burning up.
- Oh, yeah, baby, I'm burning up.

779
00:52:21,727 --> 00:52:24,025
You are most amazing
to make me feel so...

780
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:27,161
damn hot!

781
00:52:31,971 --> 00:52:34,439
I wonder how T-Bad's date's going.

782
00:52:34,540 --> 00:52:38,499
Scented candles,
massage oils, Barry White.

783
00:52:38,611 --> 00:52:41,546
Yeah, we can't be too far
from climax, huh?

784
00:53:01,734 --> 00:53:05,192
- Why do I always fail?
- You put too much pressure on yourself.

785
00:53:05,304 --> 00:53:07,636
Don't worry about the money.
I'll figure something out.

786
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:09,139
More importantly...

787
00:53:10,709 --> 00:53:13,473
when the time is right...

788
00:53:13,579 --> 00:53:14,739
it'll happen.

789
00:53:14,847 --> 00:53:16,747
You'll find the one.

790
00:53:33,198 --> 00:53:35,758
I need to see the grade transcripts
for Van Wilder, please.

791
00:53:35,868 --> 00:53:37,768
I don't think so.

792
00:53:37,870 --> 00:53:41,067
Student transcripts
are confidential. Sorry.

793
00:54:14,573 --> 00:54:16,598
Swim team really does
need your love, folks.

794
00:54:17,376 --> 00:54:21,608
And if Milty Mingleton
can shove himself...

795
00:54:21,714 --> 00:54:24,205
into that weenie bikini...

796
00:54:28,087 --> 00:54:31,579
then you don't need to be shy
about making your donations now!

797
00:55:09,094 --> 00:55:11,654
Thank you, Milty!

798
00:55:14,366 --> 00:55:16,994
After we put all the water
back in the pool...

799
00:55:17,102 --> 00:55:19,696
we'll be accepting donations
in the form of...

800
00:55:19,805 --> 00:55:22,137
cash, Visa
and full-frontal nudity.

801
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:23,708
Hutch, take over.

802
00:55:26,044 --> 00:55:29,411
That's right, folks.
Save the swim team.

803
00:55:31,316 --> 00:55:33,750
Bikini-clad judges for a fund-raiser?
That's pretty ingenious.

804
00:55:33,852 --> 00:55:36,412
Sex sells, Gwen. Sex sells.

805
00:55:36,522 --> 00:55:39,355
It's not too late for you to enter
the doubles breaststroke if you like.

806
00:55:39,458 --> 00:55:42,086
No, thanks.
I forgot my suit.

807
00:55:42,194 --> 00:55:44,321
I just came across a bit
of interesting information.

808
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:45,954
All right, look.

809
00:55:46,064 --> 00:55:49,227
The vet assured me that canine semen
is perfectly healthy.

810
00:55:49,334 --> 00:55:51,029
In fact, surprisingly rich--

811
00:55:51,136 --> 00:55:54,071
You've been 18 units shy of graduating
for the past 6 semesters.

812
00:55:58,076 --> 00:56:02,035
Whoa. You went klepto
on my transcripts.

813
00:56:02,147 --> 00:56:04,115
What's going on with you?

814
00:56:04,216 --> 00:56:06,411
You're actively trying
not to get out of here.

815
00:56:06,518 --> 00:56:10,978
Why are you doing this? Do you ever
stop playing the in-depth reporter?

816
00:56:11,089 --> 00:56:14,149
I just want to know why
you're putting off your life.

817
00:56:14,259 --> 00:56:17,251
Not for the paper.
For me.

818
00:56:17,362 --> 00:56:19,125
I have no comment...

819
00:56:20,866 --> 00:56:22,766
for either of you.

820
00:56:56,635 --> 00:56:59,502
External occipital protuberance.

821
00:57:00,873 --> 00:57:04,036
Posterior gluteal line.

822
00:57:07,212 --> 00:57:09,442
Dorsal appendage. Gwen.

823
00:57:09,548 --> 00:57:12,210
- Was the last one right?
- Yeah, that's right.

824
00:57:12,317 --> 00:57:15,809
Wrong! The dorsal appendage exists
only in marine-equipped mammalia.

825
00:57:15,921 --> 00:57:17,548
I knew you weren't listening.

826
00:57:17,656 --> 00:57:19,988
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing. I'm fine.

827
00:57:20,092 --> 00:57:22,652
Let's get out of here,
go grab a beer.

828
00:57:23,462 --> 00:57:26,625
Are you insane?
You know my midterm and finals ritual.

829
00:57:26,732 --> 00:57:29,565
I study till 11:00.
Nine solid hours of sleep.

830
00:57:29,668 --> 00:57:32,796
Protein shake in the morning.
Okay, very cute.

831
00:57:32,905 --> 00:57:34,998
And also correct.

832
00:57:35,107 --> 00:57:37,837
Which gives us 2 hours
and 53 minutes of study time.

833
00:57:37,943 --> 00:57:40,969
So, honey, please focus.
All righty?

834
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:47,682
I have confirmations
from the African-American Club...

835
00:57:47,786 --> 00:57:49,981
the Gay and Lesbian Caucus,
MECCA, HEPA, PETA.

836
00:57:50,088 --> 00:57:52,750
This multi-coalition party
was a masterful plan.

837
00:57:52,858 --> 00:57:55,520
It should triple our income.
I just hope it's enough.

838
00:57:55,627 --> 00:57:57,891
Van, you must listen to me.

839
00:57:57,996 --> 00:58:01,090
We are merely one party away
from accomplishing our goal.

840
00:58:01,199 --> 00:58:02,689
What if she's right, huh?

841
00:58:02,801 --> 00:58:05,531
What if I'm avoiding graduation
because I'm scared?

842
00:58:05,637 --> 00:58:07,366
Listen to yourself, meathead.

843
00:58:07,472 --> 00:58:09,997
You've never doubted yourself
in your whole life.

844
00:58:10,108 --> 00:58:12,440
This girl's got you thinking, man.
It's not good.

845
00:58:13,612 --> 00:58:16,513
- Not good at all.
- Hey, you!

846
00:58:16,615 --> 00:58:19,379
Please move banner
a skosh higher, huh?

847
00:58:20,953 --> 00:58:23,513
You got all this.
I'm gonna go--

848
00:58:23,622 --> 00:58:25,886
I'm gonna go make some calls
for the party, okay?

849
00:58:29,962 --> 00:58:32,396
- Hi, Van.
- Hi, Donna.

850
00:58:32,497 --> 00:58:34,727
Hey, guys.

851
00:58:37,035 --> 00:58:40,027
- What are you doing in here?
- I had to talk to you.

852
00:58:40,138 --> 00:58:42,868
I thought a lot about
what you said, and--

853
00:58:44,009 --> 00:58:46,136
Well, just--

854
00:58:46,244 --> 00:58:48,212
just take a look at this.

855
00:58:48,313 --> 00:58:50,679
Yeah. Doodles.

856
00:58:50,782 --> 00:58:53,910
I attended class today.
Just about stayed the whole time too.

857
00:58:54,019 --> 00:58:56,146
I'm glad you went
to all your classes today.

858
00:58:56,254 --> 00:58:58,154
And a few that weren't mine.
Stepped into the wrong one.

859
00:58:58,256 --> 00:59:00,349
Liked what I heard, stayed.

860
00:59:00,459 --> 00:59:02,825
That's great. It really is.

861
00:59:03,762 --> 00:59:06,697
It really is.
But don't do it for me.

862
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:09,428
Do it for you.

863
00:59:09,534 --> 00:59:12,367
Maybe I'm doing it
for both of us.

864
00:59:13,839 --> 00:59:17,775
I shouldn't even
be talking to you like this.

865
00:59:17,876 --> 00:59:20,242
And I shouldn't be
in the women's locker room!

866
00:59:20,345 --> 00:59:23,837
But sometimes you gotta let
your heart lead you...

867
00:59:23,949 --> 00:59:27,544
even if you know it's someplace
you know you're not supposed to be.

868
00:59:28,787 --> 00:59:31,255
How often does your heart lead you
into the women's locker room?

869
00:59:33,959 --> 00:59:37,190
- This would be a first.
- Why do I find that hard to believe?

870
00:59:37,295 --> 00:59:39,195
I'm not saying I've never
been in here before.

871
00:59:39,297 --> 00:59:41,925
I'm saying it's usually a different part
of my anatomy that does the leading.

872
00:59:42,034 --> 00:59:44,025
Oh, my God.

873
00:59:47,706 --> 00:59:51,164
I just couldn't believe it.
Gwen and Van in the women's locker room.

874
00:59:51,276 --> 00:59:55,042
I mean, I just couldn't believe it.
So anyway, let me tell you something.

875
01:00:05,657 --> 01:00:09,252
I'm sorry, fellas.
The bakery's closed.

876
01:00:11,663 --> 01:00:14,063
- I'm here to enlist your services.
- Let me guess.

877
01:00:14,166 --> 01:00:16,828
"Come as your favorite drunk-on-jis,
come-gargling frat boy party"?

878
01:00:16,935 --> 01:00:19,130
Then your mom can come.

879
01:00:20,906 --> 01:00:23,170
It's gonna be a bachelor party.

880
01:00:23,275 --> 01:00:25,505
One last night of debauchery
with the fellas...

881
01:00:25,610 --> 01:00:28,602
before settling down
with my fiancée, Gwen.

882
01:00:29,715 --> 01:00:33,310
Oh, please, you didn't think she'd
be interested in a fuckup like you?

883
01:00:46,531 --> 01:00:48,761
That ought to be enough
to get you started.

884
01:01:07,552 --> 01:01:08,917
Hello?

885
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,954
Casey.
I'm just using Gwen's computer.

886
01:01:11,056 --> 01:01:13,047
Is Gwen there?
I need to talk to her.

887
01:01:13,158 --> 01:01:16,389
She's at Richard's getting ready for
the engagement dinner tonight. Message?

888
01:01:16,495 --> 01:01:18,725
Nope. That's all right.

889
01:01:26,605 --> 01:01:29,005
Bye. Thanks for coming.

890
01:01:29,107 --> 01:01:31,701
Lindsey and Rob make such
a great couple, don't you think?

891
01:01:31,810 --> 01:01:33,710
Yeah, I'm happy for them.

892
01:01:33,812 --> 01:01:36,576
They're gonna make a great
married couple too. You know why?

893
01:01:36,681 --> 01:01:38,581
Because they love each other?

894
01:01:38,683 --> 01:01:40,583
Because they're compatible.

895
01:01:42,354 --> 01:01:45,517
Like a heart transplant patient finding
a donor with the same blood type...

896
01:01:45,624 --> 01:01:47,819
and just the right
chromosomal anomalies.

897
01:01:47,926 --> 01:01:50,759
A perfect match,
connected forever.

898
01:01:52,063 --> 01:01:54,691
But that would mean
one of them would have to be dead.

899
01:01:55,867 --> 01:01:58,995
Gwenny, I'm just saying
that they're a match.

900
01:01:59,104 --> 01:02:01,334
Just like you and me.

901
01:02:06,878 --> 01:02:08,368
Lucky girl.

902
01:02:09,548 --> 01:02:11,038
Gwendolyn Elizabeth Pearson...

903
01:02:11,149 --> 01:02:15,085
I'd be honored if you and I
surgically and spiritually...

904
01:02:15,187 --> 01:02:17,815
grafted our lives together.

905
01:02:17,923 --> 01:02:20,790
Richard,
I don't know what to say.

906
01:02:20,892 --> 01:02:24,851
Just say yes, because
I've got even more amazing news.

907
01:02:24,963 --> 01:02:27,193
Northwestern called this morning.
They wanna interview me.

908
01:02:27,299 --> 01:02:29,961
They're gonna send some recruit alums
to campus for written and oral exams.

909
01:02:30,068 --> 01:02:32,935
And then I am in!

910
01:02:33,038 --> 01:02:35,302
Oh, man, Northwestern.

911
01:02:35,407 --> 01:02:38,706
That's great.
I'm so happy for you, Richard.

912
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:43,873
Be happy for both of us. The Richard
and Gwen life plan is kicking in.

913
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:46,449
Northwestern.
I am the shit.

914
01:02:47,652 --> 01:02:51,213
Your father wants to get us a place in
Forest Grove as an engagement present.

915
01:02:51,323 --> 01:02:54,053
- My parents know about this?
- Yeah, I told everyone.

916
01:02:56,494 --> 01:02:58,962
Where are you going?

917
01:02:59,064 --> 01:03:01,624
I'm not sure,
and for some reason...

918
01:03:01,733 --> 01:03:04,258
I feel really good
about that.

919
01:03:08,506 --> 01:03:10,406
I can't hold on

920
01:03:11,576 --> 01:03:13,601
There's no easy way

921
01:03:13,712 --> 01:03:16,146
Hey, Van, can I borrow--

922
01:03:16,248 --> 01:03:18,148
My God, what happened to you?

923
01:03:19,417 --> 01:03:22,614
- I got hit by a big truck.
- Are you okay?

924
01:03:22,721 --> 01:03:24,484
I'm all out of love

925
01:03:24,589 --> 01:03:26,921
I'm so lost without you

926
01:03:27,025 --> 01:03:29,357
I know you were right

927
01:03:29,461 --> 01:03:32,021
Believing for so long

928
01:03:36,134 --> 01:03:39,626
Dope song.
What's it called?

929
01:03:39,738 --> 01:03:42,104
"Gwen Used Me For Her Story,
Then Married an Ass Wipe...

930
01:03:42,207 --> 01:03:45,699
and Ran Over My Heart
With a Big Metaphorical Truck."

931
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,005
Originally performed
by Air Supply.

932
01:03:48,113 --> 01:03:50,172
Who's Air Supply?

933
01:03:50,282 --> 01:03:52,341
How old are you, Sally?

934
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:56,285
I'm old enough to be jealous
of that Gwen girl.

935
01:04:04,529 --> 01:04:06,429
Okay, you can do this.

936
01:04:11,303 --> 01:04:12,861
I'm all out of love

937
01:04:12,971 --> 01:04:15,633
I'm so lost without you

938
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:19,039
I know you were right
believing for so long

939
01:04:19,144 --> 01:04:22,545
You must be Gwen--
the truck driver.

940
01:04:24,749 --> 01:04:26,649
Hey. Excuse me.
Gwen!

941
01:04:28,486 --> 01:04:30,886
Hey, hold up a second.
What are you doing here?

942
01:04:30,989 --> 01:04:33,651
What am I doing here?
What were you doing in there?

943
01:04:33,758 --> 01:04:37,387
As smashed as I am, I'm pretty sure
that's my room, wasn't it?

944
01:04:37,495 --> 01:04:40,191
What was that girl,
a freshman?

945
01:04:40,298 --> 01:04:42,823
She reads at a sophomore level.

946
01:04:42,934 --> 01:04:45,266
This was a big mistake, Van.
I'm leaving.

947
01:04:45,370 --> 01:04:48,771
Why are you here? Did you come to
hire me to do your bachelorette party?

948
01:04:48,873 --> 01:04:52,707
'Cause your party pimp has already
been booked by your fiancé.

949
01:04:52,811 --> 01:04:56,372
- My fiancé? What are you talking about?
- When are you two tying the knot?

950
01:04:56,481 --> 01:04:58,745
Seriously, I'd really
like to hold that date open.

951
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:01,842
That is none of your business.
And you know what?

952
01:05:01,953 --> 01:05:03,716
You're none of mine.

953
01:05:10,295 --> 01:05:13,423
Sounds to me like your rectal itch
was getting a late-night booty scratch.

954
01:05:13,531 --> 01:05:18,298
First, my bitch turns down my proposal.
Then she runs into that loser's arms.

955
01:05:18,403 --> 01:05:20,769
Now I don't even know
where my bitch is.

956
01:05:20,872 --> 01:05:23,636
Wilder's got some big blowout tonight.
Maybe your bitch is gonna be there.

957
01:05:23,742 --> 01:05:26,006
You do not call her that, gonad!

958
01:05:26,111 --> 01:05:28,238
Hey, guys.
Just giving you all the 411 .

959
01:05:28,346 --> 01:05:30,871
I'm a counselor for the Further
Leaders of America's overnighter.

960
01:05:30,982 --> 01:05:34,076
The bus doesn't leave for a few hours.
Is there anything I can do before I go?

961
01:05:34,185 --> 01:05:35,880
Anything at all?

962
01:05:36,688 --> 01:05:41,284
Okay, listen up. We've got
one quick stop off before we go.

963
01:05:41,393 --> 01:05:43,827
Tit wad!

964
01:05:45,663 --> 01:05:47,961
All right, thank you, man.
Enjoy yourself.

965
01:05:48,066 --> 01:05:50,125
All right, sister. Enjoy yourself.
Power to the people.

966
01:05:50,235 --> 01:05:51,998
- How you doing, my man?
- What's up?

967
01:05:53,505 --> 01:05:57,066
I hate to break this to you, Ming,
but you ain't Asian.

968
01:05:58,009 --> 01:06:00,409
Man, you ever heard
of Tiger Woods, bitch?

969
01:06:00,512 --> 01:06:03,447
You better get out of here before I hit
you upside the head with a three iron.

970
01:06:03,548 --> 01:06:06,540
What's wrong with you?
Enjoy yourself.

971
01:06:06,651 --> 01:06:09,745
- What's wrong, dog?
- Nothing. I don't feel like partying.

972
01:06:10,855 --> 01:06:12,322
That's a first.

973
01:06:12,424 --> 01:06:15,587
Hey, Van. I just wanted to come by
and extend an olive branch.

974
01:06:15,693 --> 01:06:19,459
- ID, please.
- It's a terrible picture of me, but--

975
01:06:19,564 --> 01:06:22,226
Well, I'll be the judge of--

976
01:06:22,333 --> 01:06:24,301
There's nothing fake
about this ID.

977
01:06:24,402 --> 01:06:27,030
Did you sit behind me
two semesters ago?

978
01:06:27,138 --> 01:06:29,663
I think I remember this behind.
I mean, you sitting behind me.

979
01:06:29,774 --> 01:06:32,800
This whole rivalry thing
has become a tad childish.

980
01:06:32,911 --> 01:06:37,348
Well, I hope we can put it
all behind us and be friends.

981
01:06:37,449 --> 01:06:38,882
That's what Gwen wants.

982
01:06:38,983 --> 01:06:41,747
You have absolutely
no idea what Gwen wants.

983
01:06:43,621 --> 01:06:45,851
Say hi to your gerbil for me.

984
01:06:52,964 --> 01:06:54,329
Okay, kids.

985
01:06:54,432 --> 01:06:56,332
This is our Uncle Jäger.

986
01:06:56,434 --> 01:06:59,232
That's right.
Drink up.

987
01:06:59,337 --> 01:07:02,101
This tastes like shit.
Do you have any scotch?

988
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:06,407
Gotta go.
Sorry. Bye.

989
01:07:06,511 --> 01:07:08,411
Bye-bye. Call me.

990
01:07:08,513 --> 01:07:10,140
Gentlemen.

991
01:07:10,248 --> 01:07:12,079
Trooper.

992
01:07:12,183 --> 01:07:16,244
We got an anonymous tip that there's
some underage drinking going on here.

993
01:07:16,354 --> 01:07:17,514
Hutch?

994
01:07:17,622 --> 01:07:19,647
Hell no, man.
I've been at the door all night.

995
01:07:24,362 --> 01:07:26,660
Good enough for me.
Have fun, guys.

996
01:07:26,764 --> 01:07:29,289
All right, Trapper.
Stay cool.

997
01:07:30,535 --> 01:07:34,437
- I love you, man.
- No, man.

998
01:07:34,539 --> 01:07:36,268
I love you.

999
01:07:38,376 --> 01:07:41,675
Those circus midgets
cannot hold their booze!

1000
01:07:45,984 --> 01:07:48,851
Don't worry, Van.
We'll get you out, man.

1001
01:08:00,932 --> 01:08:04,197
Delta Iota Kappa rules!

1002
01:08:08,006 --> 01:08:10,907
Damn it, Gwen, pick it up.
I know you're there.

1003
01:08:11,009 --> 01:08:13,603
You know I have my Northwestern
interview next week.

1004
01:08:14,979 --> 01:08:18,847
Look, I need you
to help me "release"...

1005
01:08:18,950 --> 01:08:20,918
some pressure.

1006
01:08:21,019 --> 01:08:25,046
You know, help me "relax."

1007
01:08:25,156 --> 01:08:27,249
Just so we're clear,
I'm talking about intercourse.

1008
01:08:27,358 --> 01:08:29,121
I know you had
a fling with Wilder.

1009
01:08:29,227 --> 01:08:33,323
And it's okay. You just had
to get it out of your system.

1010
01:08:33,431 --> 01:08:36,093
I just hope
you used some protection.

1011
01:08:36,201 --> 01:08:38,795
And I wouldn't want
our future children to be tainted...

1012
01:08:38,903 --> 01:08:41,531
because Mommy went slumming
one night back in college.

1013
01:08:43,141 --> 01:08:46,110
Why don't you go "release"
your own pressure?

1014
01:08:46,211 --> 01:08:50,841
And just so we're clear,
I'm telling you to go fuck yourself!.

1015
01:08:55,019 --> 01:08:58,511
Hi, partner in crime. Is there anything
I can do for you today?

1016
01:08:58,623 --> 01:09:00,022
Oh, my God!

1017
01:09:00,124 --> 01:09:02,285
We make such the fab team!

1018
01:09:02,393 --> 01:09:06,420
Last night, I was so like Bonnie and
you were so like Clyde. And now this.

1019
01:09:06,531 --> 01:09:09,659
Would you shut up?
I'm trying to pleasure you.

1020
01:09:09,767 --> 01:09:11,928
Sorry, Richard.
Pleasure away.

1021
01:09:14,105 --> 01:09:17,336
- PS, this is an awesome room.
- PS, shut the fuck up!

1022
01:09:22,113 --> 01:09:24,809
Here, I'm done
with all of this.

1023
01:09:24,916 --> 01:09:28,215
- The Wilder story's not done.
- Read it before you criticize.

1024
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,117
He got expelled today.
Is that in your story?

1025
01:09:31,222 --> 01:09:33,122
'Cause it should be.

1026
01:09:43,668 --> 01:09:46,637
- Is Van here?
- He don't wanna see you.

1027
01:09:46,738 --> 01:09:48,831
- Excuse me?
- Look.

1028
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:52,000
- Why don't you just leave him alone?
- Home wrecker.

1029
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:34,712
Oh, thank you!
Thank you!

1030
01:10:36,321 --> 01:10:38,551
Out of my way!

1031
01:10:44,128 --> 01:10:48,724
Stop packing! You can appeal the
expulsion. It's in the school charter.

1032
01:10:48,833 --> 01:10:52,769
"Any student may appeal an expulsion
before the university judicial board...

1033
01:10:52,870 --> 01:10:55,532
and state his or her case
within 48 hours of being discharged."

1034
01:10:56,774 --> 01:10:59,265
Do you want my hot tub,
or should I just give it to Milty?

1035
01:10:59,377 --> 01:11:01,038
We can get the law club to help.

1036
01:11:01,145 --> 01:11:03,545
They owe you after the
"Sue Me, Screw Me" soiree you threw.

1037
01:11:03,648 --> 01:11:06,640
Thank you. I appreciate it.
I'm really not interested.

1038
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:10,118
- You're not hearing me--
- It's over, Taj!

1039
01:11:13,024 --> 01:11:15,254
Fuck you, Van Wilder!

1040
01:11:17,495 --> 01:11:19,463
You heard me.
I say-- I say...

1041
01:11:19,564 --> 01:11:21,759
fuck you, you-you-you--

1042
01:11:21,866 --> 01:11:23,925
you--you--

1043
01:11:24,035 --> 01:11:26,162
you pussy ass motherfucker!

1044
01:11:26,270 --> 01:11:28,135
You-- You dicksucker!

1045
01:11:28,239 --> 01:11:30,173
Don't sugar coat it, Taj.

1046
01:11:30,274 --> 01:11:32,970
Tell me how you really feel.
Seven years.

1047
01:11:34,579 --> 01:11:37,207
Seven years!
I've accomplished nothing!

1048
01:11:37,315 --> 01:11:39,215
There's no reason
to stay here anymore!

1049
01:11:39,317 --> 01:11:41,148
Sure, sure.
You've made tons of friends...

1050
01:11:41,252 --> 01:11:45,120
who in the drop of a rupee do anything
for you, and that doesn't mean much?

1051
01:11:45,223 --> 01:11:48,158
Who cares about Sick Boy
and the charities you've helped...

1052
01:11:48,259 --> 01:11:51,160
and all of our athletics--
those are all so minuscule?

1053
01:11:51,262 --> 01:11:52,923
And I guess so is a promise...

1054
01:11:53,030 --> 01:11:56,431
made to a wet-behind-the-ears kid
from India whose only dream...

1055
01:11:56,534 --> 01:11:59,594
was to bury his face
in a beautiful woman's lotus patch.

1056
01:12:00,872 --> 01:12:03,705
You have shown me a life
I could only dream about...

1057
01:12:03,808 --> 01:12:06,436
back home while masturbating
in my father's woodshed.

1058
01:12:07,545 --> 01:12:10,343
Most importantly,
you saw potential...

1059
01:12:13,117 --> 01:12:14,641
in me.

1060
01:12:15,653 --> 01:12:19,350
If you do not see potential in yourself,
then you are a blind man.

1061
01:12:21,359 --> 01:12:22,724
I'm leaving.

1062
01:12:22,827 --> 01:12:25,295
Then leave.
But leave the honorable way.

1063
01:12:26,431 --> 01:12:29,730
You've been looking for
that dare-to-be-great situation.

1064
01:12:29,834 --> 01:12:32,234
It is at your doorstep.

1065
01:12:36,207 --> 01:12:37,572
We need to talk.

1066
01:12:50,254 --> 01:12:51,653
Get me the law club.

1067
01:13:05,303 --> 01:13:07,498
It's ridiculous!
It's preposterous!

1068
01:13:07,605 --> 01:13:10,073
It's ludicrous!
By God, it's impetuous!

1069
01:13:10,174 --> 01:13:13,166
- So does that mean you gonna help us?
- Oh, it's on.

1070
01:13:34,532 --> 01:13:37,296
Let Van stay! Let Van stay!

1071
01:13:37,401 --> 01:13:40,131
Let Van stay! Let Van stay!

1072
01:13:42,106 --> 01:13:45,132
We are now in session.
Mr. Wilder.

1073
01:13:45,243 --> 01:13:50,374
You were found in violation of Article
2, Section B of Coolidge's bylaws--

1074
01:13:50,481 --> 01:13:52,813
soliciting of alcohol
to extreme minors...

1075
01:13:52,917 --> 01:13:56,045
which is grounds
for immediate expulsion.

1076
01:13:56,153 --> 01:13:58,280
You have opted to appeal.

1077
01:13:58,389 --> 01:13:59,754
The floor is yours.

1078
01:14:02,660 --> 01:14:04,059
Ladies and gentlemen...

1079
01:14:09,700 --> 01:14:11,395
as you know...

1080
01:14:11,502 --> 01:14:14,403
I've been a student here
for seven years, and I've--

1081
01:14:14,505 --> 01:14:17,235
Let Van stay!
Let Van stay!

1082
01:14:23,381 --> 01:14:25,576
Order! Order!
Settle down, everyone.

1083
01:14:26,884 --> 01:14:30,320
- Continue, Mr. Wilder.
- I'm okay.

1084
01:14:30,421 --> 01:14:33,413
I've learned a lot here
at Coolidge.

1085
01:14:33,524 --> 01:14:36,618
Let the record show that...

1086
01:14:36,727 --> 01:14:38,422
when I attended class...

1087
01:14:38,529 --> 01:14:41,521
I did receive exemplary marks.

1088
01:14:41,632 --> 01:14:45,534
However, it was only when I met
a special someone...

1089
01:14:48,039 --> 01:14:50,439
that I realized
what I was doing--

1090
01:14:50,541 --> 01:14:52,873
hiding.

1091
01:14:52,977 --> 01:14:56,310
See, after this is real life,
and I wasn't ready for that.

1092
01:14:56,414 --> 01:14:58,314
I don't know why exactly.

1093
01:14:58,416 --> 01:15:00,680
I do know that I don't wanna
end up like my father...

1094
01:15:00,785 --> 01:15:02,685
whose whole life
revolves around work.

1095
01:15:02,787 --> 01:15:04,846
But I see that now.

1096
01:15:04,956 --> 01:15:09,120
And I'm ready to move on.

1097
01:15:09,226 --> 01:15:11,786
Well, that's that. Good luck, loser.
Who's ready for lunch?

1098
01:15:11,896 --> 01:15:14,626
- Mr. Bagg, you will be quiet.
- What's any of this got to do with...

1099
01:15:14,732 --> 01:15:18,190
that he's guilty of an infraction
that deserves expulsion?

1100
01:15:18,302 --> 01:15:19,735
Mr. Wilder.

1101
01:15:25,576 --> 01:15:27,840
I can't argue
against the infraction.

1102
01:15:27,945 --> 01:15:31,244
I was responsible for that party,
so what happened was my fault.

1103
01:15:31,349 --> 01:15:33,647
I'm here to lay myself
at the mercy of this court...

1104
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:36,584
and suggest an alternative punishment.

1105
01:15:36,687 --> 01:15:38,348
Make me graduate.

1106
01:15:38,456 --> 01:15:40,822
If you'll kindly take
a look at my transcripts...

1107
01:15:40,925 --> 01:15:44,520
you'll see I'm 18 units from graduating
with a leisure studies degree.

1108
01:15:44,629 --> 01:15:47,757
I am pleading to this committee,
reinstate me.

1109
01:15:47,865 --> 01:15:50,231
Let me audit my last six classes,
take the finals...

1110
01:15:50,334 --> 01:15:52,564
and leave Coolidge with a degree.

1111
01:15:57,074 --> 01:16:01,408
God, I've bled...

1112
01:16:01,512 --> 01:16:04,879
crimson and blue
for nearly a decade.

1113
01:16:04,982 --> 01:16:08,782
This school has given me so much.
Let me repay Coolidge...

1114
01:16:08,886 --> 01:16:11,753
by parting ways as a graduate.

1115
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:25,232
What are the courses
Mr. Wilder needs in order to graduate?

1116
01:16:25,336 --> 01:16:28,134
Biology, English Lit,
Calculus, Economics...

1117
01:16:28,239 --> 01:16:30,537
- Sociology and Political Science.
- Wow.

1118
01:16:30,641 --> 01:16:34,042
- That's quite a load.
- Well, Van can handle quite a load.

1119
01:16:36,247 --> 01:16:40,047
If we expel him, there could be
some sort of a coup d'état.

1120
01:16:40,151 --> 01:16:42,711
He broke a rule.
He should pay the consequences.

1121
01:16:42,820 --> 01:16:44,219
Well, let's take a vote.

1122
01:16:44,321 --> 01:16:46,414
There's five of us here.
Majority rules.

1123
01:16:47,391 --> 01:16:48,619
I vote reinstatement.

1124
01:16:48,726 --> 01:16:51,490
- Mr. Bagg?
- Expulsion.

1125
01:16:51,595 --> 01:16:53,563
Miss Haver?

1126
01:16:53,664 --> 01:16:54,790
Reinstatement...

1127
01:16:54,899 --> 01:16:56,833
over and over.

1128
01:16:56,934 --> 01:16:59,459
Okay. Mrs. Seay?

1129
01:16:59,570 --> 01:17:00,628
Expulsion.

1130
01:17:00,738 --> 01:17:02,899
Professor McDoogle?

1131
01:17:03,007 --> 01:17:05,635
You know, I've waited a long, long time
for this day to come.

1132
01:17:05,743 --> 01:17:07,233
Either way...

1133
01:17:07,344 --> 01:17:10,074
Van Wilder's tenure here
at Coolidge is over.

1134
01:17:15,019 --> 01:17:16,919
Let's see what
the kid's made of.

1135
01:17:18,289 --> 01:17:20,154
He's in! He's in!

1136
01:17:31,235 --> 01:17:33,499
- Hey, Jeannie.
- Look.

1137
01:17:33,604 --> 01:17:36,437
I just wanted to explain about
the whole, you know, Richard thing.

1138
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:39,668
Me and Richard's unspoken bond blossomed
the other night in one beautiful...

1139
01:17:39,777 --> 01:17:41,836
symbiotic act.

1140
01:17:41,946 --> 01:17:44,540
- What sort of act?
- Messing up that Van Wilder party.

1141
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:48,014
And then we bumped uglies.

1142
01:17:48,119 --> 01:17:50,280
It was the best ten seconds ever.

1143
01:17:52,223 --> 01:17:53,383
Ever.

1144
01:17:53,724 --> 01:17:56,693
Yes, these interviews
are somewhat of a formality...

1145
01:17:56,794 --> 01:18:00,525
but I think it's crucial we like-minded
people get to know one another.

1146
01:18:05,770 --> 01:18:08,637
- I knew you'd come to your senses.
- Hello, Richard.

1147
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:12,038
Look. I know we have a lot of surgery
to perform on our relationship.

1148
01:18:12,143 --> 01:18:15,135
But right now I am prepping
for the biggest moment of our lives.

1149
01:18:15,246 --> 01:18:20,149
I have a written exam first, and then an
interview with five Northwestern alums.

1150
01:18:20,251 --> 01:18:21,650
All doctors.

1151
01:18:21,752 --> 01:18:24,346
That's why I came--
to help make you your shake.

1152
01:18:24,455 --> 01:18:26,650
- That'd be terrific, Gwenny.
- I'll see you downstairs.

1153
01:18:28,592 --> 01:18:31,755
But hurry. Interview's in a half hour,
other side of campus.

1154
01:18:33,230 --> 01:18:35,721
Sorry about that.

1155
01:18:43,574 --> 01:18:46,270
Northwestern.
I am the shit.

1156
01:18:46,377 --> 01:18:48,436
You certainly will be.

1157
01:18:48,546 --> 01:18:50,673
Gwenny, thank you.

1158
01:18:55,886 --> 01:18:58,684
Good luck, honey.
You deserve it.

1159
01:19:05,896 --> 01:19:08,592
I certainly do.

1160
01:20:12,429 --> 01:20:13,760
Cytosine.

1161
01:20:13,864 --> 01:20:15,559
Nothin' but net, my man.

1162
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:19,500
Now remember, before any final,
take a pregame dump.

1163
01:20:35,619 --> 01:20:38,087
Thanks for coming in.
You did a great job, really.

1164
01:20:38,188 --> 01:20:41,180
Richard!
I was just talking about you.

1165
01:20:41,292 --> 01:20:43,852
Hey, surprise.
I'm on your oral exam board.

1166
01:20:43,961 --> 01:20:46,759
Look, come in here. I want you to meet
your future alumni.

1167
01:20:46,864 --> 01:20:48,798
- I gotta go--
- No, come on. It's a great time.

1168
01:20:48,899 --> 01:20:50,958
Look, it's Richard.

1169
01:20:51,068 --> 01:20:54,970
Finished his written exam in only
20 minutes. This kid is a dynamo.

1170
01:20:55,072 --> 01:20:57,472
Richard,
I want you to meet Dr. Stern.

1171
01:20:57,574 --> 01:20:58,563
Dr. Fine.

1172
01:20:58,676 --> 01:21:02,476
It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Bagg.
I've heard a lot about you.

1173
01:21:03,614 --> 01:21:06,515
- Dr. Brown.
- This is something of a formality.

1174
01:21:06,617 --> 01:21:09,415
We just want to
get to know you better.

1175
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,988
And Dr. Smelnick.

1176
01:21:13,023 --> 01:21:15,253
Richard, is there something
you want to say?

1177
01:21:15,359 --> 01:21:17,759
You look like you want
to get something out, son.

1178
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:24,092
Oh, my God!

1179
01:21:31,608 --> 01:21:33,200
- Vile.
- Oh, it burns!

1180
01:21:36,714 --> 01:21:38,079
I'm bleeding!

1181
01:21:39,249 --> 01:21:40,739
Dear God, that's wretched.

1182
01:22:04,842 --> 01:22:07,538
"Oh, I kept the first
for another day.

1183
01:22:07,644 --> 01:22:10,545
Yet knowing how way
leads on to way...

1184
01:22:10,647 --> 01:22:13,639
I doubted if I should
ever come back."

1185
01:22:13,751 --> 01:22:16,777
I want you to tell me what
Robert Frost was trying to express here.

1186
01:22:16,887 --> 01:22:19,151
I'm gonna need at least
one more booklet.

1187
01:22:20,357 --> 01:22:22,257
- What?
- In other school news...

1188
01:22:22,359 --> 01:22:24,884
we have an update
on the "Wilder Watch."

1189
01:22:24,995 --> 01:22:28,192
The rigorous day has been
a success for Van the man.

1190
01:22:28,298 --> 01:22:32,792
Five finals in the can with Professor
McDoogle's advanced econ final to go.

1191
01:22:35,572 --> 01:22:38,803
Van! Van, wake up,
wake up, wake up.

1192
01:22:38,909 --> 01:22:41,434
- Your final's in exactly seven minutes!
- All right.

1193
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:56,818
It's the moment of truth, people.

1194
01:23:12,242 --> 01:23:14,767
I'm so glad you could fit us
into your schedule this morning.

1195
01:23:14,878 --> 01:23:17,108
Wouldn't miss it
for the world, sir.

1196
01:23:18,615 --> 01:23:20,344
All right.

1197
01:23:20,451 --> 01:23:23,511
Pass these out.
Thank you.

1198
01:23:44,908 --> 01:23:46,808
It's getting to be
that time of the hour.

1199
01:23:50,414 --> 01:23:55,147
And your time is up, Mr. Wilder.
Pencils down.

1200
01:24:00,157 --> 01:24:01,818
- Thank you.
- For four years...

1201
01:24:01,925 --> 01:24:04,052
I have been grooming myself
for the real world.

1202
01:24:04,161 --> 01:24:08,621
I, like many, define the real world
as stuff that happens after graduation.

1203
01:24:08,732 --> 01:24:13,328
But I was wrong. It took a man by
the name of Van Wilder to teach me that.

1204
01:24:13,437 --> 01:24:16,133
You've all undoubtedly
been to one of Van's parties.

1205
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,471
He's probably touched your life
in some way, whether you know it or not.

1206
01:24:19,576 --> 01:24:22,044
Watch Van do belly flops
into a pool...

1207
01:24:22,146 --> 01:24:26,845
but make sure you see he's raised $5,000
to give the swim team a next season.

1208
01:24:26,950 --> 01:24:30,113
As you're all aware,
Van was almost expelled.

1209
01:24:30,220 --> 01:24:32,313
What you probably
don't know is that he was set up...

1210
01:24:32,422 --> 01:24:34,322
by a pathetic, egomaniacal frat boy...

1211
01:24:34,424 --> 01:24:37,587
one who this reporter knows firsthand
to have a serious problem...

1212
01:24:37,694 --> 01:24:40,527
with premature ejaculation.

1213
01:24:40,631 --> 01:24:42,997
And in reaction
to this lynching...

1214
01:24:43,100 --> 01:24:46,661
Van put in more effort in six days
than most have all semester.

1215
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:51,434
Win or lose, we should thank him for
reminding us what we're all capable of.

1216
01:24:51,542 --> 01:24:53,703
That's simply what he does--

1217
01:24:53,810 --> 01:24:56,643
he inspires the uninspired.

1218
01:25:01,585 --> 01:25:05,146
Van. Hurry. The night of fun
and fornication's upon us.

1219
01:25:05,255 --> 01:25:07,155
Hey, have you heard from Gwen?

1220
01:25:08,258 --> 01:25:10,488
No, she--
she hasn't yet called back.

1221
01:25:10,594 --> 01:25:13,392
Right.
I'll be down in a minute, okay?

1222
01:25:13,497 --> 01:25:15,727
- Okay.
- See ya, V.

1223
01:25:36,386 --> 01:25:40,254
Jesus.
This is some pad you got here.

1224
01:25:40,357 --> 01:25:42,587
Decorated in early fuck.

1225
01:25:47,497 --> 01:25:50,728
Well, I made it a point
to personally come down here, Wilder.

1226
01:25:50,834 --> 01:25:52,995
I wanted to give you the results
of your test firsthand.

1227
01:25:53,103 --> 01:25:55,503
And just as I expected...

1228
01:25:56,673 --> 01:25:58,197
you succeeded.

1229
01:25:58,308 --> 01:26:01,539
- Ninety-one percent.
- What?

1230
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:04,772
I'm proud of you, Wilder.

1231
01:26:04,881 --> 01:26:07,543
I've been waiting all these years
for you to realize your potential.

1232
01:26:07,651 --> 01:26:09,551
That's why you and I
had friction?

1233
01:26:09,653 --> 01:26:12,781
I thought it was 'cause I fooled around
with your daughter freshman year.

1234
01:26:13,824 --> 01:26:17,055
Why? What-- You fooled around
with my daughter?

1235
01:26:18,128 --> 01:26:19,356
What?

1236
01:26:35,746 --> 01:26:37,646
Hey, I know you.

1237
01:26:37,748 --> 01:26:40,080
- Thank you very much.
- You're the best, Van.

1238
01:26:40,183 --> 01:26:42,617
Hey, I couldn't have did it
without you. Appreciate it.

1239
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:46,587
I need you to fill this up with ice.
Pack as much as you can inside.

1240
01:26:46,690 --> 01:26:49,989
- Okay? Excuse me. I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1241
01:26:52,062 --> 01:26:54,895
My name is
Orissa Punjab Nizamabad.

1242
01:26:55,999 --> 01:26:58,661
I've just transferred here
from Banglapur.

1243
01:27:08,378 --> 01:27:10,141
Excuse me.
Can you tell me...

1244
01:27:10,247 --> 01:27:12,807
where I might find
the raddest fucking dude alive?

1245
01:27:12,916 --> 01:27:15,214
Yeah, by the pool, Gramps.

1246
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,551
Hey, I know you, man!
Oh, fuck.

1247
01:27:19,656 --> 01:27:22,591
Congratulations, Van.
I knew you had it in you.

1248
01:27:25,962 --> 01:27:27,930
Dad! I can't believe
you're here.

1249
01:27:28,031 --> 01:27:29,965
I can't believe you graduated.

1250
01:27:30,067 --> 01:27:31,762
A friend of yours...

1251
01:27:31,868 --> 01:27:34,063
sent me this.

1252
01:27:35,539 --> 01:27:38,975
I'm proud of you, Van,
graduation or no graduation.

1253
01:27:39,076 --> 01:27:41,909
Thank you.
And I'm sorry that I spent...

1254
01:27:42,012 --> 01:27:45,345
such a buttload
of your money for so long.

1255
01:27:45,449 --> 01:27:48,782
It's by far the best investment
I ever made.

1256
01:27:58,595 --> 01:28:02,190
- You did good.
- Let's get this man "leid."

1257
01:28:02,299 --> 01:28:04,733
Meet my new girl.

1258
01:28:21,184 --> 01:28:23,744
You look so--

1259
01:28:23,854 --> 01:28:25,344
Wow.

1260
01:28:25,455 --> 01:28:28,481
- Wow.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

1261
01:28:36,767 --> 01:28:40,362
- May I?
- As long as we cuddle afterwards.

1262
01:28:44,674 --> 01:28:49,008
There's so much
that I need to say-- the article--

1263
01:28:56,620 --> 01:28:59,111
I was scared
that you wouldn't come.

1264
01:28:59,222 --> 01:29:02,214
Well, I was trying to decide
what panties I should wear.

1265
01:29:03,093 --> 01:29:05,118
Which ones did you choose?

1266
01:29:05,996 --> 01:29:07,691
None.

1267
01:29:55,445 --> 01:29:57,606
It's gonna be a bachelor party.

1268
01:29:57,714 --> 01:30:00,615
One last night of debauchery
with the fellas.

1269
01:30:10,460 --> 01:30:12,621
You can't even--

1270
01:30:12,729 --> 01:30:14,720
I mean, this girl is--

1271
01:30:16,233 --> 01:30:19,566
- I was wondering--
- I'll do it.

1272
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:27,034
I'm getting my shit together.
Just one second.

1273
01:30:27,844 --> 01:30:29,402
I can't do this!

1274
01:30:39,456 --> 01:30:41,947
Oh, man. My mama never told me
I'd be doing this.

1275
01:30:44,094 --> 01:30:46,028
I want to chew the--

1276
01:30:46,129 --> 01:30:48,222
And then--
I don't know how.

1277
01:30:57,607 --> 01:31:02,169
Kids, this is what white jockey
blowin' hookers will do to you.
