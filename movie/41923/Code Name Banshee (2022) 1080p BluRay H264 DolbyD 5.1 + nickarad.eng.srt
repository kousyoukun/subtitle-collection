1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,562
<i>- We need to know what you know.</i>

2
00:00:07,296 --> 00:00:09,131
- It wasn't my op.
I have no intel.

3
00:00:09,197 --> 00:00:13,101
- It wasn't authorized.

4
00:00:13,168 --> 00:00:15,638
- No.

5
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,581
Why'd you call me here?

6
00:00:24,647 --> 00:00:26,849
- Jeremy and Caleb
have disappeared.

7
00:00:28,985 --> 00:00:31,721
As you can see,

8
00:00:31,788 --> 00:00:35,592
they delivered an asset into
the hands of the Russians.

9
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:54,811
CIA contracted Anthony Greene
and his team to stop them.

10
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:56,278
- Reads like an ambush.

11
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:57,455
- Yeah, there was a shootout.

12
00:00:57,479 --> 00:00:58,948
The asset got away.

13
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:19,301
We need to know everything
that they might have shared.

14
00:01:26,341 --> 00:01:28,878
- What happened to
my father and Caleb?

15
00:01:28,945 --> 00:01:30,713
<i>- Caleb, he fled.</i>

16
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,315
He went underground.

17
00:01:33,382 --> 00:01:36,451
<i>- My father?</i>

18
00:01:36,519 --> 00:01:38,353
- Greene reported that
your father went down,

19
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,932
but he had to remove
any dead and wounded

20
00:01:39,956 --> 00:01:41,891
before anyone else arrived.

21
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:43,693
- Where's his body?

22
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,160
- I'm assuming the
Russians got him.

23
00:01:45,193 --> 00:01:46,605
Perhaps Caleb came
back. I don't know.

24
00:01:46,629 --> 00:01:48,263
The site was clean
once we arrived back.

25
00:01:54,971 --> 00:01:57,439
As of 1800 hours last night,

26
00:01:57,507 --> 00:02:00,475
their status has been
changed internally.

27
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:03,178
The CIA has deemed
them as traitors,

28
00:02:03,245 --> 00:02:06,849
and they now have a
bounty on their head.

29
00:02:06,916 --> 00:02:08,326
Their position with
this organization

30
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,686
has been forfeited

31
00:02:09,752 --> 00:02:12,088
And anyone working with
them is now in question.

32
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,964
- Are you suggesting
that I'm a traitor?

33
00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:28,470
- Within time, I'm sure you can

34
00:02:28,538 --> 00:02:30,573
repair the damage
that's been done by...

35
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,842
Banshee, don't do this.

36
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:35,511
You're not an
enemy of the state.

37
00:02:35,578 --> 00:02:38,548
- We both know that
Caleb and my father

38
00:02:38,614 --> 00:02:40,650
were loyal to this organization.

39
00:02:40,717 --> 00:02:42,919
- Well, in light of
this current situation,

40
00:02:42,985 --> 00:02:44,185
I'm not really sure right now.

41
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:47,724
Don't do this!

42
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,966
- Take my name off your books.

43
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:59,267
I'm out.

44
00:02:59,334 --> 00:03:01,537
And when I find out
what really happened,

45
00:03:01,604 --> 00:03:03,806
I'll return for all of you

46
00:03:03,873 --> 00:03:07,009
that left them out
there to fucking die.

47
00:04:14,376 --> 00:04:16,245
- I got control of the cameras.

48
00:04:16,311 --> 00:04:17,647
You're good to go.

49
00:04:17,713 --> 00:04:20,616
In and out, just
like we planned.

50
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:22,185
There'll be two in the lobby.

51
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,217
- Any others?
<i>- None visible.</i>

52
00:04:57,086 --> 00:04:58,254
<i>Second set of elevators.</i>

53
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,357
And your chariot is on its way.

54
00:05:02,424 --> 00:05:04,227
- There's no way
those guys are Feds.

55
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:07,029
<i>- Obviously, he knows
there's a price on his head.</i>

56
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,535
- What the hell did
this guy do anyway?

57
00:05:46,602 --> 00:05:48,971
- I'm the executioner,
not the judge.

58
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,329
- Damn it!

59
00:06:13,396 --> 00:06:14,496
<i>- Kronos?</i>
- One second.

60
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:15,874
I'm having some
technical difficulty.

61
00:06:15,898 --> 00:06:17,366
- Are they taking it back?

62
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:19,135
<i>- No, no, no. Don't worry.</i>

63
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:24,740
- I need to know. Am
I walking into a trap?

64
00:06:24,807 --> 00:06:26,607
- No, it's just an
elevator. I wouldn't worry.

65
00:06:30,012 --> 00:06:31,314
- Talk to me.

66
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,982
- All right, there's
one small thing.

67
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,051
- There's no such
thing as a small thing.

68
00:06:35,117 --> 00:06:36,877
- I couldn't access the
camera on this floor.

69
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,220
- And?

70
00:06:38,287 --> 00:06:40,623
- Ugh, someone's overriding
my control in the elevator.

71
00:06:48,331 --> 00:06:49,432
- Do something.

72
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:50,498
- I can't!

73
00:07:59,902 --> 00:08:02,506
- Well, well, well.

74
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:03,773
There she is.

75
00:08:06,575 --> 00:08:09,378
Banshee...

76
00:08:09,445 --> 00:08:12,314
You still going with that?

77
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:15,551
- Anthony Greene.

78
00:08:15,618 --> 00:08:17,453
It's been a minute.

79
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:18,854
You took my kill.

80
00:08:23,459 --> 00:08:26,328
You just cost me
a million dollars.

81
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:28,864
- No.

82
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:31,300
I didn't cost you a
penny, sweetheart.

83
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:36,806
In fact, I'm going to give
you the credit and the money.

84
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:40,743
And all you have to do is
hand over your boy Caleb.

85
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:53,656
Oh, man, you're still on that?

86
00:08:53,722 --> 00:08:54,857
Really?

87
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,392
It's kind of sad,
don't you think?

88
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:59,595
- No, uh, I fucking don't.

89
00:08:59,662 --> 00:09:02,064
'Cause every second
that I get closer

90
00:09:02,131 --> 00:09:06,769
to that piece of shit
is a second well spent.

91
00:09:11,874 --> 00:09:13,852
- Five years is kind of a
long time to track someone,

92
00:09:13,876 --> 00:09:17,480
but a revenge killing is a
revenge killing, I guess.

93
00:09:17,547 --> 00:09:18,647
- Uh-huh.

94
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:24,554
For what he did, I'm
going to take his life.

95
00:09:30,459 --> 00:09:34,029
- Hmm.

96
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:37,633
We both know he's off the grid.

97
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,668
He's a fucking ghost.

98
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:43,239
- Yeah, he's a fucking ghost.

99
00:09:43,305 --> 00:09:46,543
That's why you're the perfect
person to track him down.

100
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:52,915
- If I didn't know any better,

101
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,594
I would think that
you're too big of a pussy

102
00:09:54,618 --> 00:09:56,018
to take me on one-on-one.

103
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:57,486
- Oh.

104
00:09:57,554 --> 00:09:59,623
Shut the fuck up.

105
00:10:01,924 --> 00:10:03,425
I ain't come here to play.

106
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,467
Banshee, do some thinking.

107
00:10:11,535 --> 00:10:12,902
'Cause end of the day,

108
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:17,607
we both know how this
shit's going to end.

109
00:10:17,673 --> 00:10:18,673
Don't we?

110
00:10:21,477 --> 00:10:23,712
- I do.

111
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:26,115
Kronos, open the door!

112
00:10:29,553 --> 00:10:31,220
- Opening elevator doors.

113
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:33,522
- Go!

114
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:37,793
- Kronos!
- I'm trying!

115
00:10:40,229 --> 00:10:41,463
Got it.

116
00:10:51,641 --> 00:10:54,143
- Walkie. She's
on her way down.

117
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,478
Do you hear me? She's
on her way down.

118
00:10:56,546 --> 00:10:57,780
Move, move, move.

119
00:11:05,054 --> 00:11:07,489
- I take it we're not
getting that 1 million.

120
00:11:09,693 --> 00:11:11,927
- Not now.

121
00:11:14,897 --> 00:11:16,932
- I really needed that money.

122
00:11:19,969 --> 00:11:21,837
<i>Door's about to
open. Are you ready?</i>

123
00:11:21,904 --> 00:11:23,506
- Fucking bring it.

124
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:29,945
How many?

125
00:11:30,012 --> 00:11:31,681
- Two in the lobby.
Anthony's on the move.

126
00:11:31,747 --> 00:11:32,781
I'm trying to stop him.

127
00:11:56,372 --> 00:11:58,307
- Kronos, start the car now!
<i>- Done.</i>

128
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:34,276
What?

129
00:12:43,319 --> 00:12:47,156
So one person did
all of this to us.

130
00:12:47,222 --> 00:12:48,424
Who was she talking to?

131
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:50,225
- She called him Kronos.
- Go on this.

132
00:12:50,292 --> 00:12:52,027
I wanna know who
he is, where he is.

133
00:12:52,094 --> 00:12:54,897
I want my hands on him.

134
00:12:54,963 --> 00:12:56,865
Clean this shite up.

135
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,282
- Well, that was fun, Banshee.

136
00:13:13,349 --> 00:13:15,518
- Dude, I've told
you ten million times

137
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:16,919
do not call me that.

138
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:19,254
<i>- How do you know
Anthony Greene?</i>

139
00:13:19,321 --> 00:13:22,891
- He's former Special Forces
who's made it his goal in life

140
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,561
to hunt down people for the CIA.

141
00:13:24,627 --> 00:13:26,261
<i>- So he's part of the Collective</i>

142
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:27,764
<i>and you want him dead?</i>

143
00:13:40,109 --> 00:13:42,411
- He killed someone
who's close to me.

144
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:44,490
<i>- If he's an assassin, why
does he have so many guys?</i>

145
00:13:44,514 --> 00:13:48,518
- Because he's a fucking pussy,
and he knows I would kill him.

146
00:13:51,086 --> 00:13:52,856
I need you to find
someone for me.

147
00:13:52,921 --> 00:13:55,592
<i>- That's what I'm here for.</i>

148
00:13:55,658 --> 00:13:57,426
- Find Caleb Navvaro.

149
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:04,400
<i>- Are you serious?</i>

150
00:14:04,466 --> 00:14:07,537
Caleb Navvaro?
That's our target?

151
00:14:09,739 --> 00:14:10,939
- Yes.

152
00:14:13,175 --> 00:14:16,613
- We're talking about
the same Caleb Navvaro?

153
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,482
The one that trained
you and ran black ops?

154
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,484
- That's the one.

155
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:25,154
- D, there's a thousand
people named Caleb Navvaro.

156
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:27,624
If Greene couldn't find
him, there's no way I will.

157
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:29,559
He's been underground
for five years.

158
00:14:29,626 --> 00:14:31,594
<i>And we just lost out on
a whole lot of money.</i>

159
00:14:31,661 --> 00:14:34,129
<i>Can we please just move
on to the next contract?</i>

160
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:37,299
- We will not have
another shot at Anthony.

161
00:14:37,366 --> 00:14:39,736
- Are you serious? It's
you versus a small army.

162
00:14:39,803 --> 00:14:40,837
<i>Please.</i>

163
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:43,472
- I'm not letting him win again.

164
00:14:48,878 --> 00:14:53,048
- You've seen the photographs.
Told you he's dead.

165
00:14:53,115 --> 00:14:55,585
Listen, I want our money in my
account by the end of the week.

166
00:14:55,652 --> 00:14:57,986
- Sir?

167
00:14:58,053 --> 00:15:00,088
- No, as usual, it's a million.

168
00:15:01,758 --> 00:15:03,593
Yeah, sure.

169
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:05,795
Yeah, always a pleasure.

170
00:15:05,862 --> 00:15:08,363
What?
- I've a lead on Kronos.

171
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:10,365
- And?
- Top-rate hacker.

172
00:15:10,432 --> 00:15:12,167
Acts as a middle
man for Banshee.

173
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:14,771
Apparently, he's been her
eyes and ears for a few years.

174
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,972
- So where is he?

175
00:15:17,039 --> 00:15:19,041
- I don't know yet.

176
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:22,277
- So find him,
and before sun up.

177
00:15:27,282 --> 00:15:29,552
- All right, let's see
what the CIA has to say.

178
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:35,692
- If they knew
anything, he'd be dead,

179
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:38,160
and we would not be
having this conversation.

180
00:15:38,227 --> 00:15:40,996
- Is this about
the traitor thing?

181
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:43,867
- Amongst other things, yes.

182
00:15:57,312 --> 00:16:00,015
<i>- The price on this
guy's head is 10 million.</i>

183
00:16:00,082 --> 00:16:01,416
- I know.

184
00:16:01,483 --> 00:16:03,218
<i>- And you didn't
kill him. Why?</i>

185
00:16:06,321 --> 00:16:08,825
- You don't understand.

186
00:16:08,892 --> 00:16:10,292
Greene and Caleb are worth

187
00:16:10,359 --> 00:16:12,862
so much fucking more
to me than 10 mil.

188
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:17,767
<i>- All right.</i>

189
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:20,803
Would you say you knew
him better than anyone?

190
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:21,938
<i>- Yes.</i>

191
00:16:23,272 --> 00:16:24,272
<i>Definitely.</i>

192
00:16:28,243 --> 00:16:29,522
<i>- He had to slip
up at some point,</i>

193
00:16:29,546 --> 00:16:31,915
<i>shared some kind of
info that could help us.</i>

194
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:33,550
<i>If you were Caleb,
where would you go?</i>

195
00:16:33,616 --> 00:16:35,785
<i>He's from Chicago.
Would he go back?</i>

196
00:16:35,852 --> 00:16:38,387
- Nah, nah, nah, nah.
No, no, definitely not.

197
00:16:38,453 --> 00:16:40,322
He'd gain too much
attention there.

198
00:16:40,389 --> 00:16:42,859
- Favorite vacation
spots, friends, family,

199
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:45,227
<i>something, let's... let's
work with something here.</i>

200
00:16:52,035 --> 00:16:55,004
- Wellburg. Check Wellburg.

201
00:16:56,405 --> 00:16:58,273
- Where the hell is Wellburg?
<i>- Jersey.</i>

202
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:02,144
<i>- All right, there's a few homes</i>

203
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:03,913
<i>that were purchased
five years ago.</i>

204
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,782
<i>Some businesses opened up too.</i>

205
00:17:05,848 --> 00:17:10,452
<i>Barb's Hardware. We
have an Italian place.</i>

206
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,522
<i>And there's a bar
named Old Well Tavern.</i>

207
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:13,823
That's it, that's it!

208
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:15,357
Old Well Tavern, that's it.

209
00:17:15,424 --> 00:17:17,002
<i>- Old Well Tavern, It's
owned by Walter Herrero.</i>

210
00:17:17,026 --> 00:17:18,928
<i>Looks like Mr. Herrero
bought the house and bar</i>

211
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,597
<i>about three years ago.</i>

212
00:17:20,663 --> 00:17:23,633
- Mm.

213
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:28,071
Lay low for two years,
start a new life.

214
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:31,074
That's fucking
him. Take me there.

215
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:32,642
<i>- Update the GPS.</i>

216
00:17:56,264 --> 00:18:00,402
This is what I call a game.

217
00:18:00,469 --> 00:18:03,773
Players who can actually play.

218
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,075
- It's a rerun, Rick.

219
00:18:06,141 --> 00:18:07,376
- Still.

220
00:18:07,442 --> 00:18:09,512
You know what I'm saying, right?

221
00:18:09,579 --> 00:18:12,214
Our team can't stay healthy,
and our bullpen sucks.

222
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,616
- Ugh.

223
00:18:13,683 --> 00:18:15,551
I can't see that
changing any time soon.

224
00:18:17,185 --> 00:18:20,056
Imagine if we got some decent
pitching like those guys.

225
00:18:20,123 --> 00:18:21,456
- Hmm.

226
00:18:21,524 --> 00:18:23,793
- We'd be a ball club
worth playing against.

227
00:18:26,328 --> 00:18:28,263
Ah! Another shot.

228
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:38,007
What was the, uh, home team
where you come from again?

229
00:18:38,074 --> 00:18:39,408
Laredo, right?

230
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:41,778
- Nuevo Laredo,
across the river.

231
00:18:41,844 --> 00:18:43,913
- Mm.

232
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,783
Do you run a tavern there too?

233
00:18:46,849 --> 00:18:50,385
- You always drink this
much at 10:00 a.m.?

234
00:19:01,764 --> 00:19:03,298
- Kronos?

235
00:19:03,365 --> 00:19:07,870
I'm here.

236
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:09,505
- How are you this morning?

237
00:19:09,572 --> 00:19:12,608
- Probably better than you
are. Did you drive all night?

238
00:19:12,675 --> 00:19:15,912
- No, I stopped at some dumpy...

239
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:18,213
Some dumpy...

240
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,482
Gee, Kronos, come on, man.

241
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,851
- All right, I'm here.

242
00:19:21,918 --> 00:19:22,918
I'm here.

243
00:19:26,022 --> 00:19:28,457
- Anyway, so I stopped
at some dumpy place,

244
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:30,325
and I had a shower and
a little bit of sleep.

245
00:19:30,392 --> 00:19:32,327
- Little vacation.

246
00:19:32,394 --> 00:19:33,529
- Shut up.

247
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:42,739
- You're almost there.

248
00:19:42,805 --> 00:19:45,273
- I know.

249
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:48,511
There's something I
wanna talk to you about.

250
00:19:48,578 --> 00:19:50,980
This is kind of a
personal matter,

251
00:19:51,047 --> 00:19:54,083
so I'm gonna go offline until
I sort things out with Caleb.

252
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:58,221
- No complaints with me.
I finally get a day off.

253
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,422
- Good to know.

254
00:20:00,489 --> 00:20:03,059
I'll see you on the
other side, my friend.

255
00:20:03,126 --> 00:20:04,292
<i>- Godspeed, Banshee.</i>

256
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:05,828
- Don't fucking call me that.

257
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:16,906
- Mmm!

258
00:20:19,407 --> 00:20:21,811
You're a real asshole,
you know that?

259
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:24,714
The only reason I
keep coming back here

260
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:28,918
is because my wife's a
bitch and you open early.

261
00:20:28,985 --> 00:20:32,354
- Well, at least you come back.
- Yes.

262
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:33,756
- Yes.

263
00:20:46,368 --> 00:20:47,603
- Sorry.

264
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,438
No, it was my fault.

265
00:20:50,506 --> 00:20:52,208
I'm the one who should be sorry.

266
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:56,279
And between me and you,
get your drinks and leave.

267
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:59,148
The owner is a real crank.

268
00:20:59,215 --> 00:21:00,683
- He's always been that way.

269
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,287
Yeah.

270
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:23,239
- Anybody else here?

271
00:21:23,306 --> 00:21:25,308
- Mornings are quiet.

272
00:21:27,643 --> 00:21:31,247
There is a latch
right behind you.

273
00:21:31,314 --> 00:21:32,314
You know what to do.

274
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:42,725
- I assume you want these down?

275
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:44,459
- Sure.

276
00:21:56,072 --> 00:21:57,773
- Caleb, don't.

277
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,308
- I have to.

278
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:05,447
And you too.

279
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:07,415
Just slowly.

280
00:22:16,125 --> 00:22:17,927
That's good.

281
00:22:19,729 --> 00:22:21,463
- It's great to see you too.

282
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,065
Yeah.

283
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:26,502
- How did you find me?

284
00:22:29,238 --> 00:22:32,440
- You said you were going
to buy this place someday.

285
00:22:32,508 --> 00:22:33,576
- Hmm.

286
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,678
- You were drunk, but...

287
00:22:35,745 --> 00:22:37,479
- What?
- Sincere.

288
00:22:37,546 --> 00:22:39,348
- You remember that?

289
00:22:42,351 --> 00:22:43,853
- I'm not here to kill you.

290
00:22:45,521 --> 00:22:46,822
- Okay.

291
00:22:46,889 --> 00:22:50,192
So what is my price anyway?

292
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:51,193
4 mil, 5 mil?

293
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:53,930
- Ten.

294
00:22:53,996 --> 00:22:57,199
- Well, that feels pretty good.

295
00:22:57,266 --> 00:23:00,269
- And it's, uh...

296
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:02,470
it's gonna get collected
if you don't listen to me.

297
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:08,778
Anthony Greene is
gunning for you.

298
00:23:08,844 --> 00:23:13,883
He, uh, beat me to a
job and ambushed me...

299
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,519
and offered me a
mil to give you up.

300
00:23:16,585 --> 00:23:17,720
- So you gave me up.

301
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:22,091
- Who do you think I am?

302
00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:24,660
- I haven't seen you in
years, so I don't know.

303
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:30,099
- And whose fault is that?

304
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:36,872
I am not gonna let him
get away this time.

305
00:23:40,109 --> 00:23:42,912
And I can't handle
his army alone.

306
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,553
- It looks like I...

307
00:23:50,619 --> 00:23:52,989
I trained you well.

308
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,126
So...

309
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:25,948
Hey, Suit, don't move!

310
00:25:26,015 --> 00:25:27,583
- Who's the girl
with the black hair?

311
00:25:27,650 --> 00:25:29,485
- She's my daughter.
- Your what?

312
00:25:29,553 --> 00:25:31,787
- Yeah. Hailey, she's fine.

313
00:25:31,854 --> 00:25:32,888
- Who is she?

314
00:25:32,955 --> 00:25:36,425
- Uh, she's an old
friend from work.

315
00:25:36,492 --> 00:25:37,561
- Are you a hostage?

316
00:25:37,626 --> 00:25:38,961
- No! No.

317
00:25:39,028 --> 00:25:41,497
Just stop pointing your
gun at our guest, right?

318
00:25:41,565 --> 00:25:43,265
- You have a lot of
explaining to do.

319
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:44,433
- Yeah.

320
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:46,570
Well, you know, Hailey,
this is, uh, Delilah.

321
00:25:46,635 --> 00:25:48,704
Delilah, Hailey.

322
00:25:48,771 --> 00:25:50,372
Come on, give me that.

323
00:25:58,147 --> 00:26:01,717
- Get ready to lose
everything you own, Dogmom93.

324
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:06,355
<i>- ♪ Don't talk to me ♪</i>

325
00:26:06,422 --> 00:26:08,190
<i>♪ Don't talk to me ♪</i>

326
00:26:08,257 --> 00:26:09,792
<i>- ♪ I have nothing left ♪</i>

327
00:26:12,194 --> 00:26:14,063
Ah, damn it!

328
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:15,731
She's good.

329
00:26:15,798 --> 00:26:18,234
<i>- ♪ I told you no ♪</i>

330
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,969
<i>♪ Your chance is... ♪</i>

331
00:26:23,038 --> 00:26:24,773
Hmm.

332
00:26:28,578 --> 00:26:30,146
Hello?

333
00:26:35,751 --> 00:26:37,186
Hello?

334
00:26:41,357 --> 00:26:43,359
Hello?

335
00:27:00,176 --> 00:27:03,312
- Kronos, are there any
guns hidden in here?

336
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:11,086
We're gonna find them
if there are, so...

337
00:27:11,153 --> 00:27:13,523
make things easier for
yourself and tell us.

338
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:19,195
- I always keep a
revolver in the pizza box.

339
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:22,798
- Hmm.

340
00:27:27,436 --> 00:27:28,737
- Kronos.

341
00:27:31,675 --> 00:27:33,209
What a shithole.

342
00:27:35,911 --> 00:27:39,348
So you're a gambler, huh?

343
00:27:39,415 --> 00:27:41,817
That's expensive.

344
00:27:41,884 --> 00:27:43,018
You ever won?

345
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:45,321
- Not my lucky day.

346
00:27:45,387 --> 00:27:46,855
- Eh.

347
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:50,326
I wouldn't say that.

348
00:27:50,392 --> 00:27:53,128
Yet.

349
00:27:53,195 --> 00:27:56,600
So this is how you live, huh?

350
00:27:56,666 --> 00:28:00,169
Computers and fucking plants.

351
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:05,374
- Plants don't talk back.

352
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:12,414
- Kronos, perhaps over here
would be more comfortable.

353
00:28:12,481 --> 00:28:13,916
- Okay.

354
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:26,428
- So you know the man I've
been looking for, don't ya?

355
00:28:31,367 --> 00:28:32,569
No.

356
00:28:32,636 --> 00:28:34,470
Well, I got a hunch

357
00:28:34,537 --> 00:28:38,508
that you know exactly
where the fuck he is.

358
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:41,277
No.

359
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:46,181
Well, if you don't know where
he is, maybe Banshee does.

360
00:28:46,248 --> 00:28:50,452
And I know for sure
you know where she is.

361
00:28:52,421 --> 00:28:54,990
I'm here to offer you something.

362
00:29:00,929 --> 00:29:03,733
That there...

363
00:29:03,799 --> 00:29:05,834
is a million dollars.

364
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:11,708
Now, what's your usual cut?

365
00:29:11,775 --> 00:29:13,309
20% maybe?

366
00:29:16,312 --> 00:29:17,980
Look at the balls on this guy.

367
00:29:21,884 --> 00:29:24,554
Tell him.

368
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:26,723
- Your real name's
Michael Shea Thomson.

369
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,325
You graduated from MIT with
a degree in computer science

370
00:29:29,391 --> 00:29:31,761
before joining the Department
of Homeland Security,

371
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:33,862
where you spent
every waking moment

372
00:29:33,929 --> 00:29:36,265
preventing Russian cyberattacks.

373
00:29:36,332 --> 00:29:38,434
That is, until you
realized there's more money

374
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:42,605
in contracting and
made the switch.

375
00:29:42,672 --> 00:29:44,039
- He knows me.

376
00:29:44,106 --> 00:29:48,545
- Yeah, we know you.

377
00:29:48,611 --> 00:29:52,281
Your mom and dad are dead.

378
00:29:52,348 --> 00:29:54,718
And I can't find
anyone who loves you

379
00:29:54,784 --> 00:29:57,754
that I can terrify and hurt.

380
00:29:57,821 --> 00:29:59,789
So...

381
00:29:59,855 --> 00:30:04,893
do I just kill you and then
find Banshee on my own?

382
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,697
No?

383
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:12,368
Well, that's kinda handy 'cause
I'm not much of a computer guy.

384
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:16,171
But these four
people in this room

385
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:19,174
are very, very good
at hurting people.

386
00:30:19,241 --> 00:30:22,978
And they will hurt
you for hours.

387
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:28,718
Now, do I have to
keep you alive?

388
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,053
Not at all.

389
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,256
Is it convenient for me?

390
00:30:34,323 --> 00:30:35,658
Maybe.

391
00:30:47,236 --> 00:30:49,371
- I wanna run your contracts.

392
00:30:49,438 --> 00:30:52,007
I wanna be your
eyes and your ears.

393
00:30:52,074 --> 00:30:54,410
I wanna be your new cyber guy.

394
00:30:58,981 --> 00:31:00,916
- Why would I do that?

395
00:31:00,983 --> 00:31:04,486
- 'Cause I can give you Banshee.

396
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:06,955
Let's make this deal.

397
00:31:10,025 --> 00:31:13,295
- You give me Banshee,
you give me Caleb.

398
00:31:13,362 --> 00:31:17,366
But if you try and fuck
me, son, I'll find ya.

399
00:31:34,082 --> 00:31:37,986
- Is your mom a painter?

400
00:31:38,053 --> 00:31:40,122
- Was.

401
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,490
She's dead.

402
00:31:45,461 --> 00:31:47,664
- Nancy got diagnosed with
cancer four years ago.

403
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:50,567
She... she died a few
months before we moved here.

404
00:31:53,101 --> 00:31:54,571
- I'm sorry.

405
00:31:55,037 --> 00:31:56,539
Yeah.

406
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:00,710
- If she's your friend,

407
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:02,444
then how does she
not know about Mom?

408
00:32:02,512 --> 00:32:07,249
- Well, we... we... we
weren't that close, actually.

409
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,753
- Are you kidding?

410
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:17,125
- What are you
guys talking about?

411
00:32:17,192 --> 00:32:19,061
- Your dad and my
dad were very close,

412
00:32:19,127 --> 00:32:21,296
so we grew up together.

413
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,035
- Was your dad in construction?

414
00:32:32,207 --> 00:32:34,911
- We worked into... In
construction together.

415
00:32:34,978 --> 00:32:37,279
- Yep, well, there was a time...

416
00:32:38,515 --> 00:32:41,450
we'd be in some kind
of danger spots and...

417
00:32:41,518 --> 00:32:43,285
- Yeah, like when we
had to build skyscrapers

418
00:32:43,352 --> 00:32:46,221
and had to have
each other's backs.

419
00:32:50,058 --> 00:32:51,937
- What does any of that have to
do with not knowing about Mom?

420
00:32:51,961 --> 00:32:58,066
- Well... it's been a
long time, Hailey, really.

421
00:32:58,133 --> 00:32:59,969
Yeah.

422
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:01,275
- Well, she knows where we are.

423
00:33:01,303 --> 00:33:04,007
Does she know about the mob?
- Hailey, enough.

424
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:06,241
Don't you have
some homework to do

425
00:33:06,308 --> 00:33:08,277
or a show to watch
on television?

426
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,116
- Fine.
- Good.

427
00:33:14,182 --> 00:33:15,450
- I'll go upstairs.

428
00:33:15,518 --> 00:33:16,518
- Thank you.

429
00:33:32,134 --> 00:33:34,837
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm...
okay. All right.

430
00:33:34,904 --> 00:33:35,904
- Good night.

431
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,350
Construction worker?

432
00:33:48,417 --> 00:33:50,419
Really?

433
00:33:50,485 --> 00:33:52,055
Out of all the
options that you had,

434
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,957
you went with
construction worker?

435
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,528
- Yeah.

436
00:33:58,595 --> 00:34:00,763
Construction sites in big cities

437
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,497
can get tangled
with dirty people,

438
00:34:02,565 --> 00:34:04,266
giving me a reason to
move to a small town.

439
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,637
So construction.

440
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:11,040
- Ah, so you're
hiding from the mob?

441
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:16,178
Makes sense, why she
said hello at gunpoint.

442
00:34:17,947 --> 00:34:20,683
Oh, and you're training
her to fight the mob.

443
00:34:22,986 --> 00:34:24,496
Well, it's interesting
because it's very similar

444
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,254
to how you trained me.

445
00:34:26,321 --> 00:34:28,390
Yeah.

446
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:32,227
So you wanted to
talk about Anthony.

447
00:34:32,294 --> 00:34:35,765
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

448
00:34:35,832 --> 00:34:37,543
- Was he there that night
with you and my father?

449
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:41,004
- No, no, no, no. We're
done with my past, eh?

450
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:43,006
We're talking about Anthony.

451
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:46,509
- This isn't about your past.

452
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:48,845
You are...

453
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:53,683
You <i>were</i> such an
amazing mentor for me.

454
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:56,586
And I need you.

455
00:34:56,653 --> 00:34:57,854
I really do.

456
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,055
I need your help.

457
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:07,864
- You know, all your
questions are for Anthony.

458
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,215
Yeah, he was there.

459
00:35:31,954 --> 00:35:33,455
- Was he alone?

460
00:35:33,523 --> 00:35:34,724
Did he bring anyone?

461
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:35,958
- Does it matter?

462
00:35:39,294 --> 00:35:40,294
- No.

463
00:35:44,801 --> 00:35:48,771
- So you're gonna
fight Stalin Jr.?

464
00:35:48,838 --> 00:35:50,606
- No.
- Oh.

465
00:35:50,673 --> 00:35:54,711
- We are going to
fight him together.

466
00:35:58,081 --> 00:36:01,316
Don't you wanna stop hiding?

467
00:36:01,383 --> 00:36:03,753
- Can't change the past.

468
00:36:05,688 --> 00:36:06,789
I am fine.

469
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:08,256
I'm fine right here.

470
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,262
- What happened to you?

471
00:36:17,533 --> 00:36:21,170
- You know, I...

472
00:36:21,236 --> 00:36:23,873
I wish your father was here

473
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:28,878
as much as you do.

474
00:36:28,945 --> 00:36:32,314
I know what it feels
like to be alone.

475
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,788
There is more to life than
just contract killing.

476
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,458
I'm happy now.

477
00:36:43,526 --> 00:36:45,460
Right here, right now, yes.

478
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:51,801
- Well, I'm happy
for your happiness.

479
00:36:51,868 --> 00:36:52,902
- Thank you.

480
00:36:55,337 --> 00:36:59,642
But, um...

481
00:36:59,709 --> 00:37:02,645
I am not gonna be your bait.

482
00:37:04,312 --> 00:37:06,916
- Hey, it was a good move.

483
00:37:10,219 --> 00:37:12,454
- Well, you taught me well.

484
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:18,727
Hold on.

485
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:40,683
The files on your
dad are two in back.

486
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:45,688
- Good night, Banshee.

487
00:37:48,024 --> 00:37:49,592
- Thank you.

488
00:37:51,027 --> 00:37:52,027
- You're welcome.

489
00:38:26,295 --> 00:38:30,066
- Malia, this is Mr. Navvaro.

490
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:34,003
He's a friend of myself
and our organization.

491
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:40,843
- Uh...

492
00:38:40,910 --> 00:38:43,980
Miss Malia, I... I understand,
uh, your father is,

493
00:38:44,046 --> 00:38:46,616
uh, is a powerful man.

494
00:38:46,682 --> 00:38:48,851
- You know who he is.

495
00:38:48,918 --> 00:38:50,485
- I do.

496
00:38:50,553 --> 00:38:52,922
I would like to
know who you are.

497
00:38:55,157 --> 00:38:56,859
And I also would like to know

498
00:38:56,926 --> 00:39:00,062
what do you get out
of this whole thing?

499
00:39:05,534 --> 00:39:08,571
- Protection. All I
want is protection.

500
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,506
- But, yeah.

501
00:39:10,573 --> 00:39:11,707
But you don't get protection

502
00:39:11,774 --> 00:39:13,509
just because your
father is a billionaire.

503
00:39:13,576 --> 00:39:15,511
You know I can't grant it.

504
00:39:23,052 --> 00:39:25,154
- On that drive is just a taste.

505
00:39:25,221 --> 00:39:26,789
Customers, transactions,

506
00:39:26,856 --> 00:39:29,457
but most important,
blueprints to weapons

507
00:39:29,525 --> 00:39:31,560
most governments
don't even know about.

508
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:33,596
The government, with all
the secrets he's stolen,

509
00:39:33,663 --> 00:39:37,300
takes a leap forward
by ten years.

510
00:39:37,366 --> 00:39:38,501
- Right.

511
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,205
- It's all there.
- I'm sure it is.

512
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:50,579
Or it's all fake

513
00:39:50,646 --> 00:39:53,716
and you're just,
uh, setting us up.

514
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:56,752
- I don't care what
you suits think.

515
00:39:56,819 --> 00:39:59,355
I get you the names
of all his buyers

516
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:01,524
and the locations
of all his weapons,

517
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:04,393
and I get protection.

518
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,497
He's a monster,

519
00:40:09,565 --> 00:40:13,569
and I need you to hide me as
far away from him as you can.

520
00:40:25,281 --> 00:40:26,415
- Right.

521
00:40:28,351 --> 00:40:30,119
I'll make some calls, yeah.

522
00:40:54,677 --> 00:40:57,213
Good morning.

523
00:40:57,279 --> 00:41:01,117
Hmm.

524
00:41:08,324 --> 00:41:10,292
- So that's what happened.

525
00:41:15,831 --> 00:41:18,801
I knew it.

526
00:41:18,868 --> 00:41:20,770
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

527
00:41:20,836 --> 00:41:22,204
I fucking knew it.

528
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:29,678
Where's my dad?

529
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,349
- Move on. You know
nothing has changed.

530
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,717
Nothing.

531
00:41:42,558 --> 00:41:46,629
- They didn't recover his body.

532
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:48,330
He could still be out there.

533
00:41:48,397 --> 00:41:52,334
- Banshee, I saw him go down.

534
00:42:00,843 --> 00:42:04,780
- But they didn't find him.

535
00:42:04,847 --> 00:42:06,615
He could still be out there.

536
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,887
- You know, I-I-I told you
yesterday, that's, uh...

537
00:42:11,954 --> 00:42:13,923
- That's a question for Anthony.

538
00:42:21,197 --> 00:42:22,198
- Good morning.

539
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:40,983
- Am I interrupting something?

540
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:41,917
- Uh, no.

541
00:42:41,984 --> 00:42:45,287
Just, uh, having
a cup of coffee.

542
00:42:45,354 --> 00:42:49,492
Speaking of which,
uh, I should be going.

543
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:51,093
Ugh.

544
00:42:52,394 --> 00:42:57,032
D, call the tavern
if anything comes up.

545
00:43:13,315 --> 00:43:14,783
- The pub has a
front and a back door

546
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:16,385
that leads to a parking lot.

547
00:43:16,452 --> 00:43:19,455
It's pretty straightforward.

548
00:43:19,523 --> 00:43:22,758
- There's nothing
straightforward about Caleb.

549
00:43:22,825 --> 00:43:24,693
What about the house?

550
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:30,666
- Dead-end streets
surrounded by woods.

551
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,401
- Banshee's probably there.

552
00:43:32,468 --> 00:43:35,437
That means Caleb knows
that you're coming.

553
00:43:35,505 --> 00:43:37,373
- We're coming?

554
00:43:37,439 --> 00:43:38,707
Are you not going?

555
00:43:38,774 --> 00:43:40,843
- Oh, Jesus Christ,
you know what?

556
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,479
You want to question me again?

557
00:43:43,547 --> 00:43:44,914
Please.

558
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,617
Do I need to find
another assistant?

559
00:43:49,785 --> 00:43:51,020
How long?

560
00:43:51,086 --> 00:43:54,056
- Um, six hours or so.

561
00:43:56,992 --> 00:43:59,629
Call the Philly team.

562
00:43:59,695 --> 00:44:01,797
- What are you thinking?

563
00:44:01,864 --> 00:44:03,766
- Two teams.

564
00:44:03,832 --> 00:44:06,802
One takes the house,
one takes the tavern.

565
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:08,672
They can be there
within the hour.

566
00:44:11,307 --> 00:44:13,909
And tell the team that
goes to the Old Well,

567
00:44:13,976 --> 00:44:17,146
you know, be subtle, be quiet.

568
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:19,081
Caleb is smart. It
may all be for not.

569
00:44:19,148 --> 00:44:21,050
Tell them to text me
when they're in position.

570
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:22,885
- Got it.

571
00:44:22,952 --> 00:44:26,623
- And remind them
I want him alive.

572
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:30,392
Alive and kicking
'cause he's mine.

573
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,862
You got it?
- Got it.

574
00:44:33,929 --> 00:44:35,397
- So make the damn call.

575
00:44:38,334 --> 00:44:42,606
You, find me a
take-away. I'm starving.

576
00:45:05,761 --> 00:45:08,764
- All right, so we
head out at 1500.

577
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,166
No sooner, no later.

578
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:14,704
Stay off the main
road at all cost.

579
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:18,340
We wouldn't want any uninvited
guest during the party.

580
00:45:18,407 --> 00:45:22,512
Now, when we reach the
outskirts of town, we hit dirt.

581
00:45:22,579 --> 00:45:26,382
Now, all off-road until we
find an old packing house

582
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:28,183
about seven clicks out.

583
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,887
There, the handoff
to the CIA happens.

584
00:45:31,954 --> 00:45:34,123
Male and female agents,

585
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,892
they will take Malia and her
drives into protective custody.

586
00:45:36,959 --> 00:45:38,595
Good? Happiness?

587
00:45:38,662 --> 00:45:42,464
All right, so get some coffee,
take a nap, and be ready.

588
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,437
- Jeremy, wait.
- What is it?

589
00:45:48,505 --> 00:45:52,808
- This all sounds
great, Mr. Navvaro.

590
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,810
But?

591
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:57,614
- But there's no Plan B.

592
00:45:57,681 --> 00:45:58,782
- This is a routine op.

593
00:45:58,847 --> 00:46:00,249
We have done it
hundreds of times,

594
00:46:00,316 --> 00:46:03,553
and I trust my men, believe me.

595
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,988
- Seems as though you've
taken every precaution

596
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,524
against my father's men,

597
00:46:07,590 --> 00:46:10,527
who are definitely out there
hunting for me right now.

598
00:46:10,593 --> 00:46:14,897
But you've taken no precautions
against your own men.

599
00:46:16,465 --> 00:46:18,334
- Malia, if I may,

600
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,704
it is normal to be
a little nervous

601
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:24,139
or even paranoid as we
get closer to the handoff.

602
00:46:24,206 --> 00:46:25,441
- Is it..
- But...

603
00:46:25,508 --> 00:46:29,178
- More rational to be
paranoid or careless?

604
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:32,381
I am risking
everything being here.

605
00:46:32,448 --> 00:46:35,317
You have no idea what he'll
do to me if he catches me.

606
00:46:35,384 --> 00:46:36,885
I've held up my
end of the bargain,

607
00:46:36,952 --> 00:46:39,488
and I expect you to do the same.

608
00:46:39,556 --> 00:46:41,924
- We are.

609
00:46:44,326 --> 00:46:46,462
Have you met the agents
I'm being handed off to?

610
00:46:46,529 --> 00:46:47,564
- Of course.

611
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,600
They are CIA agents
with top clearance.

612
00:46:50,667 --> 00:46:53,570
- The CIA's always been the
most trustworthy organization.

613
00:46:53,636 --> 00:46:56,372
- Let us do our job, Malia.

614
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:59,875
In six months, you will be
living wherever you want

615
00:46:59,942 --> 00:47:01,778
and doing whatever
the fuck you want.

616
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,414
Trust me, okay?

617
00:47:05,481 --> 00:47:07,049
Okay.

618
00:47:12,121 --> 00:47:14,323
- Hey, it's okay.

619
00:48:59,796 --> 00:49:02,732
- Used to be one
of my favorites.

620
00:49:02,799 --> 00:49:05,467
- Used to?

621
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,770
- Memories suck when
you know how they end.

622
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:14,911
So what's your deal?

623
00:49:14,978 --> 00:49:17,045
- My deal?

624
00:49:17,112 --> 00:49:18,356
- You came here to
get my dad's help,

625
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,549
but you haven't done anything

626
00:49:19,616 --> 00:49:22,519
but eat and stare at
photos of my family.

627
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,624
Were you lovers or something?

628
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:30,459
No.

629
00:49:30,527 --> 00:49:34,597
I've known him
since I was seven.

630
00:49:34,664 --> 00:49:36,064
- Is he in danger?

631
00:49:38,801 --> 00:49:41,971
Look, I know he's in
danger with the mob.

632
00:49:42,037 --> 00:49:44,541
I looked at your
file on the table.

633
00:49:44,607 --> 00:49:45,985
Are you with the
government or something?

634
00:49:46,009 --> 00:49:47,249
- You shouldn't have done that.

635
00:49:47,309 --> 00:49:48,678
- I'm sorry. I
couldn't help it.

636
00:49:48,745 --> 00:49:50,523
I feel like he's in danger,
and he is all I have left.

637
00:49:50,547 --> 00:49:52,147
Hey, if he's in
danger, I need to know,

638
00:49:52,214 --> 00:49:53,048
because I will not
let anything...

639
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,952
- Stop!

640
00:49:56,019 --> 00:49:58,453
I'm here to help you.

641
00:49:58,521 --> 00:50:02,090
Now, tell me everything
that you know.

642
00:50:02,157 --> 00:50:05,427
Sit.

643
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:07,095
Sit.

644
00:50:34,189 --> 00:50:37,092
- Tough, but quiet bar owner.

645
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:39,394
Love it.

646
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:41,564
Let's start with,
uh, three beers.

647
00:50:41,631 --> 00:50:45,167
- Sure.

648
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:46,936
All right.

649
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,170
- And some menus.

650
00:50:48,236 --> 00:50:53,076
- Oh, I'm sorry, but,
uh, the cook is sick.

651
00:50:53,141 --> 00:50:55,778
- That's fine then.

652
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,714
We're celebrating, actually.

653
00:50:57,780 --> 00:50:59,481
- All right.

654
00:50:59,549 --> 00:51:02,117
- Yep, my son's getting married.

655
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,620
- Oh, wow.

656
00:51:03,686 --> 00:51:08,357
Well, nothing says wedding
destination like Wellburg.

657
00:51:08,423 --> 00:51:10,258
Ah!

658
00:51:10,325 --> 00:51:11,460
- He grew up here.
- Yeah.

659
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:12,967
- It's like one last
bit of nostalgia

660
00:51:12,996 --> 00:51:16,032
before he takes that
next big step in life.

661
00:51:16,099 --> 00:51:20,202
- Hey, you know, you seem
happier about it than he is.

662
00:51:26,542 --> 00:51:28,578
- Ah, what can I say?

663
00:51:28,645 --> 00:51:30,513
Guess he knows what he's
getting himself into.

664
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,180
Yeah, it's true.

665
00:51:32,247 --> 00:51:33,783
Excuse me, gentlemen.

666
00:51:42,625 --> 00:51:44,794
- They're in position.
- Good.

667
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:46,461
Give them the go.

668
00:51:46,529 --> 00:51:48,665
And tell the other
team to hit the house.

669
00:51:48,731 --> 00:51:51,366
And make sure they find
anything they may have on me,

670
00:51:51,433 --> 00:51:54,604
and to keep him alive
until I get there.

671
00:52:07,215 --> 00:52:09,886
- I didn't read much of it.

672
00:52:09,952 --> 00:52:11,854
I just saw pictures of bodies

673
00:52:11,921 --> 00:52:14,724
and buzz words
like nuclear codes.

674
00:52:17,492 --> 00:52:20,797
Are people coming here?

675
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,899
- Yes.

676
00:52:22,965 --> 00:52:24,366
- What are we gonna do?

677
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:46,055
It's my dad.

678
00:52:47,355 --> 00:52:48,356
<i>- Hey, Baby.</i>

679
00:52:48,423 --> 00:52:49,568
You see, I forgot to tell you

680
00:52:49,592 --> 00:52:51,894
that the repairman is coming by.

681
00:52:51,961 --> 00:52:53,029
- They're here.

682
00:53:00,036 --> 00:53:03,271
- Yeah, I'll be there
as soon as I can, yeah.

683
00:53:03,338 --> 00:53:05,307
Uh, yeah, give a kiss
to the baby for me.

684
00:53:05,373 --> 00:53:07,677
- I will.
- Thank you. Bye.

685
00:53:10,378 --> 00:53:11,279
- Get your gun.

686
00:53:11,346 --> 00:53:13,082
Now!

687
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:43,311
- Honestly...

688
00:53:43,378 --> 00:53:44,747
I have seen worse.

689
00:53:44,814 --> 00:53:47,449
I mean, you were
very good, very good.

690
00:53:47,517 --> 00:53:49,085
But these two?

691
00:53:49,152 --> 00:53:51,087
They preform like wet towels.

692
00:54:19,282 --> 00:54:20,516
- Three entrances. Any others?

693
00:54:20,583 --> 00:54:22,618
- Basement entrance
comes out down the hall.

694
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:23,695
- Hailey, I want
you to go upstairs,

695
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:24,954
lock yourself in your room.

696
00:54:25,021 --> 00:54:26,330
And do not come out
until I say it's clear.

697
00:54:26,354 --> 00:54:27,924
- I'm not leaving you alone.

698
00:54:29,091 --> 00:54:30,159
- Hailey, go!

699
00:56:34,016 --> 00:56:35,985
- Let me go!

700
00:56:48,631 --> 00:56:50,266
- Get off! Get up!

701
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,114
- Don't worry.

702
00:57:05,181 --> 00:57:06,983
I'll take care of your
girl when you're gone.

703
00:58:10,479 --> 00:58:11,947
- Hey.

704
00:58:12,014 --> 00:58:13,014
Baby.

705
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,952
Hey, baby.

706
00:58:35,037 --> 00:58:40,009
Um... hey...

707
00:58:40,076 --> 00:58:45,147
she needs to know the truth...

708
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:47,683
before she hears lies.

709
00:58:50,319 --> 00:58:51,620
- Yes.

710
00:58:54,290 --> 00:58:57,259
- I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you this before.

711
00:58:57,326 --> 00:58:58,260
I'm sorry.

712
00:58:58,327 --> 00:58:59,505
- It's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

713
00:58:59,529 --> 00:59:01,597
- Hmm, yeah?

714
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:03,332
I, you know, I have trained you.

715
00:59:03,399 --> 00:59:08,437
And you have to listen
to... To D now, all right?

716
00:59:08,505 --> 00:59:10,272
You understand me?

717
00:59:10,339 --> 00:59:11,440
- I understand.

718
00:59:11,508 --> 00:59:14,310
- You understand what
I'm trying... good, good.

719
00:59:19,583 --> 00:59:22,218
Hide her.

720
00:59:22,284 --> 00:59:23,520
- I will.

721
00:59:27,690 --> 00:59:29,658
- You know they want her, right?

722
00:59:29,725 --> 00:59:31,595
- Yes.

723
00:59:33,829 --> 00:59:37,266
- Hey, Baby, you're...

724
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:40,136
you're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

725
01:00:09,365 --> 01:00:11,333
- What's the word on the
team that had the house?

726
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,570
- Not a thing.

727
01:00:13,637 --> 01:00:15,137
- Okay, they're dead.

728
01:00:15,204 --> 01:00:16,648
- I mean, maybe
they're just waiting...

729
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:18,874
- Nah, they're dead.

730
01:00:18,941 --> 01:00:20,676
What about the spotters?

731
01:00:20,743 --> 01:00:22,978
- They're in position now.

732
01:00:23,045 --> 01:00:26,982
Caleb's car's there, but
no sign of him or Banshee.

733
01:00:27,049 --> 01:00:30,252
- So they're holed up in
the house waiting for us.

734
01:00:32,589 --> 01:00:34,256
What're you hearing?

735
01:00:34,323 --> 01:00:36,992
- Our three are dead
inside the tavern.

736
01:00:37,059 --> 01:00:39,395
- And is there anything
to link them back to us?

737
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:41,263
- Cops think it was
a robbery gone wrong.

738
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:43,032
They're trying to
find the owner.

739
01:00:43,098 --> 01:00:46,335
- How long before
we get some backup?

740
01:00:46,402 --> 01:00:48,113
- There's another team
coming from the city now.

741
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:50,406
They'll be here in three hours.

742
01:00:50,472 --> 01:00:52,609
- Ugh, make sure they hustle.

743
01:00:52,676 --> 01:00:54,009
I want these assholes.

744
01:00:54,076 --> 01:00:56,712
- What if they run?
- Where?

745
01:00:56,779 --> 01:00:58,548
There's only one
way out of town.

746
01:00:58,615 --> 01:01:00,015
The spotters will see them.

747
01:01:00,082 --> 01:01:02,952
So now, we just sit back and
we play the waiting game.

748
01:01:36,952 --> 01:01:38,821
- What was it he
wanted me to know?

749
01:01:41,691 --> 01:01:43,459
- The truth about who he was.

750
01:01:51,133 --> 01:01:55,104
<i>The CIA sent a man named
Anthony to kill them.</i>

751
01:01:55,170 --> 01:01:58,941
<i>They said that
they were traitors</i>

752
01:01:59,008 --> 01:02:01,010
<i>selling witnesses'
intel to the Russians.</i>

753
01:02:03,045 --> 01:02:05,881
<i>- Why would the CIA do that?</i>

754
01:02:07,916 --> 01:02:09,552
<i>- They were getting old.</i>

755
01:02:09,619 --> 01:02:11,755
<i>They were too powerful,
and they knew too much.</i>

756
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:33,770
- Fuck!

757
01:03:52,354 --> 01:03:54,490
<i>- Caleb went into hiding.</i>

758
01:03:54,557 --> 01:03:56,258
<i>My father had been shot.</i>

759
01:03:56,325 --> 01:03:57,993
<i>And Anthony's brother
had been killed.</i>

760
01:04:02,364 --> 01:04:05,802
- So Anthony will come here?

761
01:04:05,869 --> 01:04:10,305
- I fucking hope so.

762
01:04:10,372 --> 01:04:14,611
- Good.

763
01:04:14,677 --> 01:04:17,980
Do you have a plan?

764
01:04:18,046 --> 01:04:23,419
- I'm working on one.

765
01:04:23,485 --> 01:04:25,254
- Come with me.

766
01:04:35,899 --> 01:04:37,166
Will this help?

767
01:04:52,281 --> 01:04:54,049
- He kept all these?

768
01:04:54,116 --> 01:04:55,852
- He had trust issues.

769
01:04:58,954 --> 01:05:00,690
Lucky me.

770
01:05:10,032 --> 01:05:12,836
We should take the upstairs.
It'll be to our advantage.

771
01:05:12,902 --> 01:05:15,170
- My dad said if you
aren't mobile, you're dead.

772
01:05:15,237 --> 01:05:16,338
- Normally, that's true.

773
01:05:16,405 --> 01:05:19,975
But if we go anywhere,
they'll find us.

774
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:22,110
This house is our territory.

775
01:05:22,177 --> 01:05:25,113
It's advantageous to us.

776
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:27,382
- Won't they just burn us out?
- No way.

777
01:05:27,449 --> 01:05:29,953
They need Caleb's
body as proof of kill.

778
01:05:30,018 --> 01:05:30,954
I have a price on my head,

779
01:05:31,019 --> 01:05:32,339
so they'll wanna
collect that too.

780
01:05:51,306 --> 01:05:53,643
- How many you got?

781
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:54,811
- Enough.

782
01:05:57,881 --> 01:05:59,516
- Send them in.

783
01:06:30,479 --> 01:06:33,650
- What was he really like?

784
01:06:33,716 --> 01:06:35,150
- What?

785
01:06:35,217 --> 01:06:39,622
- My dad. What was
he really like?

786
01:06:39,689 --> 01:06:42,224
- I think you probably
knew him best.

787
01:06:42,291 --> 01:06:44,426
You just knew a
different version of him.

788
01:06:47,964 --> 01:06:49,164
- Which version did you know?

789
01:06:52,969 --> 01:06:57,907
I knew the big, strong,
I'm-a-bad-ass Caleb.

790
01:07:01,476 --> 01:07:05,247
He had a hard shell, but...

791
01:07:05,314 --> 01:07:07,249
he had a soft spot
for a few people.

792
01:07:17,026 --> 01:07:19,996
- What was it like when
you lost your parents?

793
01:07:23,933 --> 01:07:26,836
- It was hard.

794
01:07:26,903 --> 01:07:29,739
I was angry.

795
01:07:29,806 --> 01:07:32,976
But I just kept my head
down, focused on the work,

796
01:07:33,042 --> 01:07:36,813
and eye on the prize.

797
01:07:45,253 --> 01:07:48,190
- So he really
never mentioned us?

798
01:07:48,256 --> 01:07:49,759
- No.

799
01:07:52,427 --> 01:07:56,833
Which means he loved
you more than anything.

800
01:07:56,899 --> 01:07:57,910
He was protecting your safety

801
01:07:57,934 --> 01:08:00,069
even from the ones that
he trusted the most.

802
01:08:09,444 --> 01:08:15,084
- So you guess it's just us now?

803
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:16,385
- Yes.

804
01:08:20,422 --> 01:08:23,793
- That's fine.

805
01:08:23,860 --> 01:08:25,260
Kinda like you.

806
01:08:28,463 --> 01:08:30,399
- Kinda like you too.

807
01:09:03,265 --> 01:09:05,968
- Why are they not getting out?

808
01:09:24,352 --> 01:09:26,321
- Come here.

809
01:09:29,992 --> 01:09:31,426
- What are you doing?

810
01:09:31,493 --> 01:09:34,396
- They're using thermal.
We need to register as one.

811
01:09:52,081 --> 01:09:54,150
<i>- Looks like the front
door is boarded up.</i>

812
01:09:57,352 --> 01:09:59,254
- Walkie.

813
01:09:59,321 --> 01:10:00,890
Go around the back.

814
01:10:00,957 --> 01:10:02,191
Make sure it's the same.

815
01:10:02,257 --> 01:10:03,257
<i>- Roger that.</i>

816
01:10:32,588 --> 01:10:33,856
- Two guys across the yard.

817
01:10:36,626 --> 01:10:39,461
<i>- Back door's boarded up too.</i>

818
01:10:39,529 --> 01:10:41,130
- Did they just board
it up and leave?

819
01:10:48,738 --> 01:10:51,908
- All I'm seeing is
one thermal image,

820
01:10:51,974 --> 01:10:55,745
so what the fuck are
you talking about?

821
01:10:55,812 --> 01:10:58,047
- Is there any sign
of life downstairs?

822
01:10:58,114 --> 01:11:01,284
<i>- Negative. I'll
go around back.</i>

823
01:11:01,349 --> 01:11:03,119
- Sir, what if it's a trap?

824
01:11:03,186 --> 01:11:04,821
- Of course it's a trap.

825
01:11:04,887 --> 01:11:07,355
But I need to know who
the second person is.

826
01:11:07,422 --> 01:11:11,961
Use this to find out
before Caleb's on.

827
01:11:14,864 --> 01:11:15,898
It's time.

828
01:11:38,521 --> 01:11:41,423
- Hey, Banshee!

829
01:11:43,292 --> 01:11:47,029
Little bitch! Little bitch!

830
01:11:47,096 --> 01:11:50,066
Time to play!

831
01:11:50,132 --> 01:11:52,001
Come on, Banshee.

832
01:11:53,502 --> 01:11:55,905
I know you're in there.

833
01:11:58,808 --> 01:12:02,078
- D, don't worry about me!

834
01:12:02,144 --> 01:12:03,445
Kill this bastard!

835
01:12:10,119 --> 01:12:12,555
- Banshee...

836
01:12:12,622 --> 01:12:15,558
are you really going
to let your boy die?

837
01:12:18,426 --> 01:12:19,862
- Do something.

838
01:12:19,929 --> 01:12:22,298
- I can't.

839
01:12:22,365 --> 01:12:25,501
Anthony's the only one
who knows about my father.

840
01:12:27,370 --> 01:12:29,505
- Oh!

841
01:12:34,076 --> 01:12:36,178
Three more in the back.

842
01:12:36,245 --> 01:12:37,580
Go.

843
01:12:47,757 --> 01:12:49,517
- Three going around
back! They're coming in!

844
01:14:06,235 --> 01:14:09,305
- Oh, fucking Christ!

845
01:14:11,674 --> 01:14:14,343
Rush the house!
Rush the house!

846
01:14:43,672 --> 01:14:44,673
- How's it going?

847
01:14:44,740 --> 01:14:46,175
- Not great!

848
01:15:46,368 --> 01:15:47,670
Fucking useless.

849
01:15:50,306 --> 01:15:52,608
They keep kicking them
before they go off!

850
01:15:52,675 --> 01:15:54,544
- Cook 'em.
- What?

851
01:15:54,610 --> 01:15:55,678
- Cook 'the grenades.

852
01:15:55,744 --> 01:15:57,379
- I don't know what that means!

853
01:15:57,446 --> 01:15:59,682
- Hold them for a few seconds
before you throw them.

854
01:16:04,653 --> 01:16:09,158
- One, two, three...

855
01:16:19,768 --> 01:16:22,404
- You got a gun?

856
01:16:30,614 --> 01:16:32,281
You do now.

857
01:16:34,183 --> 01:16:35,684
Come on.

858
01:17:03,979 --> 01:17:05,314
- Five or six coming in!

859
01:17:05,381 --> 01:17:06,949
- Eyes on Anthony?
- I don't know!

860
01:17:07,016 --> 01:17:08,217
They're all wearing masks!

861
01:17:08,284 --> 01:17:10,452
- Fucker's trying
to wear us down.

862
01:18:37,439 --> 01:18:38,974
Go upstairs now.

863
01:18:58,193 --> 01:18:59,895
Fuck!

864
01:19:19,815 --> 01:19:22,318
- Go. Go, go, go, go!

865
01:19:39,769 --> 01:19:41,805
- Finally.

866
01:19:41,870 --> 01:19:43,472
- Fuck off.

867
01:19:48,310 --> 01:19:49,978
Do you got any men left alive?

868
01:19:50,045 --> 01:19:53,583
- I don't know. I
think they're all dead.

869
01:19:56,118 --> 01:19:58,688
- No, I can't do this.

870
01:19:58,755 --> 01:20:00,757
- Of course you can.

871
01:20:00,824 --> 01:20:02,191
Listen to me.

872
01:20:02,257 --> 01:20:04,393
Who we find in that
building, I want them alive.

873
01:20:04,460 --> 01:20:05,928
- Are you serious?

874
01:20:05,994 --> 01:20:07,363
- Yeah, I'm serious.

875
01:20:07,429 --> 01:20:10,332
Until I put them in body
bags, I'm very serious.

876
01:20:10,399 --> 01:20:11,399
Go.

877
01:20:21,611 --> 01:20:23,813
Fuck.

878
01:20:23,879 --> 01:20:24,879
- Whoa!

879
01:20:27,950 --> 01:20:30,419
Wow.

880
01:20:30,486 --> 01:20:31,920
Look at you, girl.

881
01:20:33,422 --> 01:20:34,657
Good job.

882
01:20:36,793 --> 01:20:37,861
Where's Caleb?

883
01:20:40,797 --> 01:20:42,532
Go, go, go!

884
01:21:13,095 --> 01:21:15,431
Where's Caleb?

885
01:21:15,497 --> 01:21:16,800
- I have an idea.

886
01:21:16,866 --> 01:21:18,744
How about you get your
fucking dudes off the girl?

887
01:21:18,768 --> 01:21:21,771
I'll tell you where Caleb is,
you tell me where my father is,

888
01:21:21,838 --> 01:21:23,105
everybody's fucking happy.

889
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,845
- I don't recall
where your father is.

890
01:21:28,912 --> 01:21:30,145
- You're a liar.

891
01:21:30,212 --> 01:21:32,582
You know what? You're right.

892
01:21:32,649 --> 01:21:34,149
I do recall.

893
01:21:34,216 --> 01:21:35,919
The last time I seen him,

894
01:21:35,984 --> 01:21:38,287
there was a couple of guys
beating the shit out of him.

895
01:21:38,353 --> 01:21:40,322
And he was lying
in a pool of blood.

896
01:21:40,389 --> 01:21:42,859
Silly me.

897
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,609
- Get the fuck in here!

898
01:21:59,676 --> 01:22:02,745
- Feels like a little
much for a teenage girl!

899
01:22:05,882 --> 01:22:07,617
- They never found a body.

900
01:22:09,586 --> 01:22:14,423
- Or because your father's
a traitor, and he ran away.

901
01:22:14,490 --> 01:22:16,425
- Wrong. Get them
off the fucking girl!

902
01:22:27,804 --> 01:22:31,708
- Where's Caleb?

903
01:22:31,774 --> 01:22:34,911
- Buried in the back yard.

904
01:22:34,978 --> 01:22:38,413
- Now you're upsetting me
because I know you're lying!

905
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:43,051
'Cause after Caleb shot my men,

906
01:22:43,118 --> 01:22:46,221
I know he came back here.

907
01:22:46,288 --> 01:22:47,790
Where the fuck is he?

908
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,503
- Oh, you're feeling tough?

909
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:01,671
Okay.

910
01:23:03,673 --> 01:23:06,709
Let's do this old school.

911
01:23:24,961 --> 01:23:26,896
- Shoot her!

912
01:24:23,118 --> 01:24:25,153
Shoot her!

913
01:25:00,255 --> 01:25:02,224
- Yeah. Hey, hey, hey.

914
01:25:04,493 --> 01:25:07,229
Where...

915
01:25:07,295 --> 01:25:09,331
the fuck...

916
01:25:09,398 --> 01:25:13,670
is... Caleb?

917
01:25:13,736 --> 01:25:14,837
Huh?

918
01:25:14,904 --> 01:25:18,107
- You punch like a
little fucking bitch.

919
01:25:18,173 --> 01:25:20,543
- Hey, asshole.

920
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:22,210
Fuck you.

921
01:25:26,248 --> 01:25:27,817
- Fuck.

922
01:26:15,397 --> 01:26:19,267
- Are there more?

923
01:26:19,334 --> 01:26:21,403
- I hope not.

924
01:26:24,874 --> 01:26:28,410
- I got shot today.

925
01:26:28,477 --> 01:26:30,947
- I got shot too.

926
01:26:31,013 --> 01:26:34,817
- No. I got shot.

927
01:26:34,884 --> 01:26:36,152
In the shoulder.

928
01:26:39,922 --> 01:26:42,759
- It's a flesh wound.
You'll be okay.

929
01:26:48,231 --> 01:26:49,799
- What's next?

930
01:26:49,866 --> 01:26:52,001
Are more people
gonna shoot at us?

931
01:26:57,305 --> 01:26:58,508
- Probably.

932
01:27:01,511 --> 01:27:04,180
It just depends on where
we go and who we go after.

933
01:27:07,617 --> 01:27:09,252
But for now, let's
just get a cocktail

934
01:27:09,317 --> 01:27:12,420
and a steak in a hotel room.

935
01:27:12,487 --> 01:27:14,456
- There's nothing I'd rather do.
