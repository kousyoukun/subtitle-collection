1
00:01:00,763 --> 00:01:02,465
-我们需要知道你所知道的
- We need to know what you know.

2
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,034
-那不是我的任务，我没有情报。
- It wasn't my op. I have no intel.

3
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,004
-未经授权。
- It wasn't authorized.

4
00:01:10,071 --> 00:01:12,541
——没有。

5
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:21,484
你为什么叫我来?
Why'd you call me here?

6
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,752
-杰里米和凯勒消失了
- Jeremy and Caleb have disappeared.

7
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:32,495
如你所见，他们把一个线人交给了俄国人。
As you can see, they delivered an asset into the hands of the Russians.

8
00:01:46,408 --> 00:01:51,714
中情局雇了安东尼·格林和他的团队来阻止他们。
CIA contracted Anthony Greene and his team to stop them.

9
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,181
-看起来像是埋伏。
- Reads like an ambush.

10
00:01:53,248 --> 00:01:54,358
-是的，发生了枪战。
- Yeah, there was a shootout.

11
00:01:54,382 --> 00:01:55,851
线人跑了。
The asset got away.

12
00:02:11,901 --> 00:02:16,204
我们需要知道他们可能分享过的一切。
We need to know everything that they might have shared.

13
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:25,781
-我父亲和凯勒怎么了
- What happened to my father and Caleb?

14
00:02:25,848 --> 00:02:27,616
-凯勒，他逃走了
- Caleb, he fled.

15
00:02:27,683 --> 00:02:30,218
他去地下。
He went underground.

16
00:02:30,285 --> 00:02:33,354
——我的父亲吗?
- My father?

17
00:02:33,422 --> 00:02:38,794
-格林报告说你父亲倒下了，但他必须在其他人到达之前转移所有的伤亡人员。
- Greene reported that your father went down, but he had to remove any dead and wounded before anyone else arrived.

18
00:02:38,861 --> 00:02:40,596
-他的尸体呢?
- Where's his body?

19
00:02:40,663 --> 00:02:42,063
-我猜俄国人抓住他了。
- I'm assuming the Russians got him.

20
00:02:42,096 --> 00:02:43,508
也许凯勒回来了。我不知道。
Perhaps Caleb came back. I don't know.

21
00:02:43,532 --> 00:02:45,166
我们回来的时候现场已经干净了。
The site was clean once we arrived back.

22
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:57,378
截至昨晚18点，他们的状态在内部发生了变化。
As of 1800 hours last night, their status has been changed internally.

23
00:02:57,446 --> 00:03:03,752
CIA认为他们是叛徒，现在他们的人头被悬赏。
The CIA has deemed them as traitors, and they now have a bounty on their head.

24
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:08,991
他们在这个组织的地位已经被剥夺了所有和他们共事的人现在都有问题。
Their position with this organization has been forfeited And anyone working with them is now in question.

25
00:03:14,863 --> 00:03:18,867
-你是在暗示我是叛徒吗?
- Are you suggesting that I'm a traitor?

26
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:29,745
-在一段时间内，我相信你能修复被…女妖，别这样。
- Within time, I'm sure you can repair the damage that's been done by... Banshee, don't do this.

27
00:03:29,812 --> 00:03:32,414
你不是国家的敌人。
You're not an enemy of the state.

28
00:03:32,481 --> 00:03:37,553
-我们都知道凯勒和我父亲对这个组织很忠诚
- We both know that Caleb and my father were loyal to this organization.

29
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,088
-鉴于目前的情况，我不太确定。
- Well, in light of this current situation, I'm not really sure right now.

30
00:03:42,357 --> 00:03:44,627
不要这样做!
Don't do this!

31
00:03:51,533 --> 00:03:53,869
-把我的名字从你的账簿上划掉
- Take my name off your books.

32
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,170
我出去了。
I'm out.

33
00:03:56,237 --> 00:04:03,912
等我查出真相，我会回来找你们这些把他们丢在外面等死的人。
And when I find out what really happened, I'll return for all of you that left them out there to fucking die.

34
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,148
-我控制了摄像头。
- I got control of the cameras.

35
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:14,550
你可以走了。
You're good to go.

36
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:17,519
进进出出，就像我们计划的那样。
In and out, just like we planned.

37
00:05:17,586 --> 00:05:19,088
有两个人在大厅。
There'll be two in the lobby.

38
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:51,120
,还有其他的吗?——没有可见的。
- Any others? - None visible.

39
00:05:53,989 --> 00:05:55,157
第二套电梯。
Second set of elevators.

40
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,260
你的战车已经在路上了。
And your chariot is on its way.

41
00:05:59,327 --> 00:06:01,130
-他们不可能是联邦探员。
- There's no way those guys are Feds.

42
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,932
-显然他知道有人悬赏他的人头
- Obviously, he knows there's a price on his head.

43
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:43,438
-这家伙到底做了什么?
- What the hell did this guy do anyway?

44
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:45,874
-我是刽子手，不是法官
- I'm the executioner, not the judge.

45
00:07:08,864 --> 00:07:10,232
——该死的!
- Damn it!

46
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,399
——科隆诺斯?- 1秒。
- Kronos? - One second.

47
00:07:11,466 --> 00:07:12,777
我遇到了一些技术上的困难。
I'm having some technical difficulty.

48
00:07:12,801 --> 00:07:14,269
-他们要收回吗?
- Are they taking it back?

49
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,038
-不不不别担心。
- No, no, no. Don't worry.

50
00:07:19,074 --> 00:07:21,643
-我需要知道我是不是走进了一个陷阱?
- I need to know. Am I walking into a trap?

51
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,510
-不，只是个电梯。我不会担心。
- No, it's just an elevator. I wouldn't worry.

52
00:07:26,915 --> 00:07:28,217
-告诉我。
- Talk to me.

53
00:07:28,283 --> 00:07:29,885
-好吧，有件小事。
- All right, there's one small thing.

54
00:07:29,952 --> 00:07:31,954
-没有什么是小事。
- There's no such thing as a small thing.

55
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,780
-我无法进入这层楼的摄像头。
- I couldn't access the camera on this floor.

56
00:07:33,822 --> 00:07:35,123
- - - ?
- And?

57
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,526
-有人在电梯里控制我。
- Ugh, someone's overriding my control in the elevator.

58
00:07:45,234 --> 00:07:46,335
——做点什么。
- Do something.

59
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,401
——我不能!
- I can't!

60
00:08:56,805 --> 00:08:59,409
-好，好，好。
- Well, well, well.

61
00:08:59,474 --> 00:09:00,676
她就在那儿。
There she is.

62
00:09:03,478 --> 00:09:09,217
女妖……你还这么说吗?
Banshee... You still going with that?

63
00:09:09,284 --> 00:09:12,454
——安东尼·格林。
- Anthony Greene.

64
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:14,356
已经一分钟了。
It's been a minute.

65
00:09:14,424 --> 00:09:15,757
你杀了我。
You took my kill.

66
00:09:20,362 --> 00:09:23,231
你让我损失了一百万美元。
You just cost me a million dollars.

67
00:09:23,298 --> 00:09:25,767
——没有。
- No.

68
00:09:25,834 --> 00:09:28,203
我没花你一分钱，亲爱的。
I didn't cost you a penny, sweetheart.

69
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:33,709
事实上，我会把功劳和钱都给你。
In fact, I'm going to give you the credit and the money.

70
00:09:33,775 --> 00:09:37,646
你所要做的就是交出你的凯勒。
And all you have to do is hand over your boy Caleb.

71
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,559
天啊，你还在想这个?
Oh, man, you're still on that?

72
00:09:50,625 --> 00:09:51,760
真的吗?
Really?

73
00:09:51,827 --> 00:09:53,295
这有点可悲，你不觉得吗?
It's kind of sad, don't you think?

74
00:09:53,362 --> 00:09:56,498
-不，我他妈不知道
- No, uh, I fucking don't.

75
00:09:56,565 --> 00:10:03,672
因为我接近那混蛋的每一秒都是值得的。
'Cause every second that I get closer to that piece of shit is a second well spent.

76
00:10:08,777 --> 00:10:14,383
-五年的时间对追踪一个人来说有点长，但我想复仇杀人就是复仇杀人。
- Five years is kind of a long time to track someone, but a revenge killing is a revenge killing, I guess.

77
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,550
——嗯。
- Uh-huh.

78
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,457
为了他的所作所为，我要杀了他。
For what he did, I'm going to take his life.

79
00:10:27,362 --> 00:10:30,932
——嗯。
- Hmm.

80
00:10:30,999 --> 00:10:34,536
我们都知道他销声匿迹了。
We both know he's off the grid.

81
00:10:34,603 --> 00:10:36,571
他是个该死的鬼。
He's a fucking ghost.

82
00:10:36,638 --> 00:10:40,142
-是啊，他是个该死的鬼。
- Yeah, he's a fucking ghost.

83
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,446
所以你才是找到他的最佳人选。
That's why you're the perfect person to track him down.

84
00:10:48,617 --> 00:10:52,921
-如果我不了解你，我会觉得你太娘娘腔了，不会跟我一对一的。
- If I didn't know any better, I would think that you're too big of a pussy to take me on one-on-one.

85
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:54,389
——哦。
- Oh.

86
00:10:54,457 --> 00:10:56,526
你他妈闭嘴。
Shut the fuck up.

87
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:00,328
我不是来玩的。
I ain't come here to play.

88
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:08,370
女妖，想想办法。
Banshee, do some thinking.

89
00:11:08,438 --> 00:11:14,510
因为说到底，我们都知道结局会怎样。
'Cause end of the day, we both know how this shit's going to end.

90
00:11:14,576 --> 00:11:15,576
不是吗?
Don't we?

91
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:20,615
——我做的。
- I do.

92
00:11:21,716 --> 00:11:23,018
克罗诺斯，开门!
Kronos, open the door!

93
00:11:26,456 --> 00:11:28,123
-打开电梯门。
- Opening elevator doors.

94
00:11:29,425 --> 00:11:30,425
——走吧!
- Go!

95
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:34,696
——科隆诺斯!——我在!
- Kronos! - I'm trying!

96
00:11:37,132 --> 00:11:38,366
明白了。
Got it.

97
00:11:48,544 --> 00:11:51,046
——步行式。她在下来的路上。
- Walkie. She's on her way down.

98
00:11:51,113 --> 00:11:53,381
你听到了吗?她在下来的路上。
Do you hear me? She's on her way down.

99
00:11:53,449 --> 00:11:54,683
移动,移动,移动。
Move, move, move.

100
00:12:01,957 --> 00:12:04,392
-我想我们拿不到那100万了
- I take it we're not getting that 1 million.

101
00:12:06,596 --> 00:12:08,830
,而不是现在。
- Not now.

102
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,835
-我真的需要那笔钱。
- I really needed that money.

103
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:18,740
门就要开了。你准备好了吗?
Door's about to open. Are you ready?

104
00:12:18,807 --> 00:12:20,409
-来吧。
- Fucking bring it.

105
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,848

106
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:28,584
-两个在大厅。安东尼在行动。

107
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,684
我在试图阻止他。
I'm trying to stop him.

108
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,210
-克罗诺斯，马上开车!——完成。
- Kronos, start the car now! - Done.

109
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:31,179
什么?
What?

110
00:13:40,222 --> 00:13:44,059
所以这一切都是一个人造成的。
So one person did all of this to us.

111
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,327
她在跟谁说话?
Who was she talking to?

112
00:13:45,393 --> 00:13:47,128
-她叫他克洛诺斯。-继续。

113
00:13:47,195 --> 00:13:48,930
我要知道他是谁，在哪里。

114

我要亲手抓住他。

115
00:13:51,866 --> 00:13:53,768
把这里收拾干净。

116
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:10,185
-那很有趣，女妖。
- Well, that was fun, Banshee.

117
00:14:10,252 --> 00:14:13,822
-哥们，我告诉过你千万次了，别那样叫我。
- Dude, I've told you ten million times do not call me that.

118
00:14:13,888 --> 00:14:16,157
-你怎么认识安东尼·格林的?

- He killed someone who's close to me.

122
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:41,393

123
00:14:41,417 --> 00:14:45,421
-因为他是个娘们，他知道我会杀了他。
- Because he's a fucking pussy, and he knows I would kill him.

124
00:14:47,989 --> 00:14:49,759
我需要你帮我找个人。

127

00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:04,440
迦勒Navvaro吗?这是我们的目标?

- We're talking about the same Caleb Navvaro?

131
00:15:13,582 --> 00:15:17,385
那个训练你并负责秘密行动的人?
The one that trained you and ran black ops?

132
00:15:17,453 --> 00:15:19,387
-就是这个。

- D, there's a thousand people named Caleb Navvaro.

134
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:24,527
如果格林找不到他，我也不可能。
If Greene couldn't find him, there's no way I will.

135
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:26,462
他已经在地下工作五年了。
He's been underground for five years.

273
00:26:26,456 --> 00:26:28,690

275
00:26:29,858 --> 00:26:33,328
-她是我工作上的老朋友

276
00:26:33,395 --> 00:26:34,464
-你是人质吗?
- Are you a hostage?

277
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,864
——不!不。
- No! No.

278
00:26:35,931 --> 00:26:38,400
别再拿枪指着我们的客人了，好吗?
Just stop pointing your gun at our guest, right?

279
00:26:38,468 --> 00:26:40,168
-你得好好解释一下。
- You have a lot of explaining to do.

280
00:26:40,235 --> 00:26:41,336
-是的。

281
00:26:41,404 --> 00:26:43,473
海莉，这是黛利拉。
Well, you know, Hailey, this is, uh, Delilah.

来吧，给我。
Come on, give me that.

284

准备好失去你所拥有的一切吧，Dogmom93。
- Get ready to lose everything you own, Dogmom93.

285
00:27:01,491 --> 00:27:03,258
♪不要和我说话♪

喂?
Hello?

296
00:27:57,079 --> 00:28:00,215
-克罗诺斯，这里有藏枪吗?
- Kronos, are there any guns hidden in here?

297
00:28:03,185 --> 00:28:10,426
如果有的话我们会找到的，所以…为了方便你自己，告诉我们吧。
We're gonna find them if there are, so... make things easier for yourself and tell us.

- I always keep a revolver in the pizza box.

299
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,701

300
00:28:24,339 --> 00:28:25,640
——科隆诺斯。
- Kronos.

301
00:28:28,578 --> 00:28:30,112
坨屎。
What a shithole.

302
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:36,251
你是个赌徒，是吗?
So you're a gambler, huh?

303
00:28:36,318 --> 00:28:38,720
这是昂贵的。
That's expensive.

304
00:28:38,787 --> 00:28:39,921
你曾经赢了?
You ever won?

305
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:42,224
-我今天运气不好。
- Not my lucky day.

306
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,758
——嗯。
- Eh.

307
00:28:43,825 --> 00:28:47,229
我不会这么说。
I wouldn't say that.

308
00:28:47,295 --> 00:28:50,031
然而。
Yet.

309
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:53,503
这就是你的生活吗?
So this is how you live, huh?

310
00:28:53,569 --> 00:28:57,072
电脑和他妈的植物。
Computers and fucking plants.

311
00:28:59,975 --> 00:29:02,277
植物不会顶嘴的。
- Plants don't talk back.

312
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:09,317
-克罗诺斯，也许这边更舒服些。
- Kronos, perhaps over here would be more comfortable.

313
00:29:09,384 --> 00:29:10,819
——好的。
- Okay.

314
00:29:17,593 --> 00:29:23,331
-你认识我一直在找的那个人，对吧?
- So you know the man I've been looking for, don't ya?

315
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,472
不。
No.

316
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:35,411
我有预感你知道他他妈的在哪。
Well, I got a hunch that you know exactly where the fuck he is.

317
00:29:35,478 --> 00:29:38,180
不。
No.

318
00:29:38,246 --> 00:29:43,084
如果你不知道他在哪，也许女妖知道。
Well, if you don't know where he is, maybe Banshee does.

319
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:47,355
我确定你知道她在哪里。
And I know for sure you know where she is.

320
00:29:49,324 --> 00:29:51,893
我是来给你点东西的。
I'm here to offer you something.

321
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:02,737
有……是一百万美元。
That there... is a million dollars.

322
00:30:04,739 --> 00:30:08,611
现在，你通常拿多少?
Now, what's your usual cut?

323
00:30:08,678 --> 00:30:10,212
20%的可能?
20% maybe?

324
00:30:13,215 --> 00:30:14,883
看看这家伙的蛋蛋。
Look at the balls on this guy.

325
00:30:18,787 --> 00:30:21,457
告诉他。
Tell him.

326
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:23,626
-你的真名是迈克尔·谢伊·汤姆森。
- Your real name's Michael Shea Thomson.

327
00:30:23,693 --> 00:30:33,168
你毕业于麻省理工学院，获得了计算机科学学位，然后加入了国土安全部，在那里你每时每刻都在防止俄罗斯的网络攻击。
You graduated from MIT with a degree in computer science before joining the Department of Homeland Security, where you spent every waking moment preventing Russian cyberattacks.

328
00:30:33,235 --> 00:30:39,508
直到你意识到承包合同可以赚更多的钱，然后做出转变。
That is, until you realized there's more money in contracting and made the switch.

329
00:30:39,575 --> 00:30:40,942
-他认识我。
- He knows me.

330
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:45,448
-是的，我们认识你。
- Yeah, we know you.

331
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:49,184
你的父母都死了。
Your mom and dad are dead.

332
00:30:49,251 --> 00:30:54,657
我找不到一个爱你的人让我害怕和伤害。
And I can't find anyone who loves you that I can terrify and hurt.

333
00:30:54,724 --> 00:31:01,796
所以…我要杀了你，然后自己去找女妖吗?
So... do I just kill you and then find Banshee on my own?

334
00:31:01,863 --> 00:31:04,600
没有?
No?

335
00:31:04,667 --> 00:31:09,271
嗯，那有点方便，因为我不太懂电脑。
Well, that's kinda handy 'cause I'm not much of a computer guy.

336
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:16,077
但这个房间里的这四个人非常非常擅长伤害别人。
But these four people in this room are very, very good at hurting people.

337
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:19,881
他们会伤害你好几个小时。
And they will hurt you for hours.

338
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,621
我还得让你活着吗?
Now, do I have to keep you alive?

339
00:31:25,688 --> 00:31:27,956
不客气。
Not at all.

340
00:31:28,023 --> 00:31:31,159
我方便吗?
Is it convenient for me?

341
00:31:31,226 --> 00:31:32,561
也许吧。
Maybe.

342
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:46,274
-我想管理你的合同。
- I wanna run your contracts.

343
00:31:46,341 --> 00:31:48,910
我想做你的眼睛和耳朵。
I wanna be your eyes and your ears.

344
00:31:48,977 --> 00:31:51,313
我想做你的新网络男。
I wanna be your new cyber guy.

345
00:31:55,884 --> 00:31:57,819
-我为什么要那么做?
- Why would I do that?

346
00:31:57,886 --> 00:32:01,389
-因为我可以给你女妖。
- 'Cause I can give you Banshee.

347
00:32:01,457 --> 00:32:03,858
让我们做个交易。
Let's make this deal.

348
00:32:06,928 --> 00:32:10,198
-给我女妖，就给我凯勒
- You give me Banshee, you give me Caleb.

349
00:32:10,265 --> 00:32:14,269
但如果你想上我，我会找到你的。
But if you try and fuck me, son, I'll find ya.

350
00:32:30,985 --> 00:32:34,889
-你妈妈是画家吗?
- Is your mom a painter?

351
00:32:34,956 --> 00:32:37,025
——是。
- Was.

352
00:32:37,092 --> 00:32:38,393
她死了。
She's dead.

353
00:32:42,364 --> 00:32:44,567
-南希四年前被诊断出癌症。
- Nancy got diagnosed with cancer four years ago.

354
00:32:44,633 --> 00:32:47,470
她……她在我们搬到这里的几个月前去世了。
She... she died a few months before we moved here.

355
00:32:50,004 --> 00:32:51,474
——我很抱歉。
- I'm sorry.

356
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,442
是的。
Yeah.

357
00:32:56,277 --> 00:32:59,347
-如果她是你朋友，她怎么会不知道妈妈的事?
- If she's your friend, then how does she not know about Mom?

358
00:32:59,415 --> 00:33:04,152
——嗯,我们……我们……事实上，我们没有那么亲密。
- Well, we... we... we weren't that close, actually.

359
00:33:05,053 --> 00:33:07,656
-你在开玩笑吧?
- Are you kidding?

360
00:33:11,893 --> 00:33:14,028
-你们在说什么?
- What are you guys talking about?

361
00:33:14,095 --> 00:33:18,199
-你爸爸和我爸爸关系很好，所以我们一起长大。
- Your dad and my dad were very close, so we grew up together.

362
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:23,938
-你爸爸是建筑工吗?
- Was your dad in construction?

363
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,814
-我们一起在建筑工地工作。
- We worked into... In construction together.

364
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:43,124
-是啊，有段时间…我们会处在某种危险的地方…-是啊，就像我们要建摩天大楼，要互相扶持一样。
- Yep, well, there was a time... we'd be in some kind of danger spots and... - Yeah, like when we had to build skyscrapers and had to have each other's backs.

365
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:48,840
-这些和不知道妈妈有什么关系?
- What does any of that have to do with not knowing about Mom?

366
00:33:48,864 --> 00:33:54,969
——嗯…好久不见了，海莉，真的。
- Well... it's been a long time, Hailey, really.

367
00:33:55,036 --> 00:33:56,872

368
00:33:56,938 --> 00:33:58,178
-她知道我们在哪
- Well, she knows where we are.

369
00:33:58,206 --> 00:34:00,910
她知道黑帮的事吗?Hailey,足够了。
Does she know about the mob? - Hailey, enough.

370
00:34:00,975 --> 00:34:05,180
你没有作业要做吗?没有电视节目要看吗?
Don't you have some homework to do or a show to watch on television?

371
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:11,019
——好。——好。
- Fine. - Good.

372
00:34:11,085 --> 00:34:12,353
-我上楼去。
- I'll go upstairs.

373
00:34:12,421 --> 00:34:13,421
——谢谢。
- Thank you.

374
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:31,740
嘿,我很抱歉。我…好吧。好吧。
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm... okay. All right.

375
00:34:31,807 --> 00:34:32,807
——晚安。
- Good night.

376
00:34:40,683 --> 00:34:45,253
建筑工人?
Construction worker?

377
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,322
真的吗?
Really?

378
00:34:47,388 --> 00:34:50,860
你有那么多选择，却选了建筑工人?
Out of all the options that you had, you went with construction worker?

379
00:34:53,963 --> 00:34:55,431
-是的。
- Yeah.

380
00:34:55,498 --> 00:35:01,169
大城市的建筑工地可能会与肮脏的人纠缠在一起，这给了我一个搬到小城镇的理由。
Construction sites in big cities can get tangled with dirty people, giving me a reason to move to a small town.

381
00:35:01,236 --> 00:35:04,540
所以建设。
So construction.

382
00:35:04,607 --> 00:35:07,943
-所以你在躲避黑帮?
- Ah, so you're hiding from the mob?

383
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:13,081
这就说得通了，为什么她拿着枪跟我打招呼。
Makes sense, why she said hello at gunpoint.

384
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:17,586
你还训练她对抗黑帮。
Oh, and you're training her to fight the mob.

385
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:23,157
这很有趣，因为这和你训练我的方式很相似。
Well, it's interesting because it's very similar to how you trained me.

386
00:35:23,224 --> 00:35:25,293
是的。
Yeah.

387
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:29,130
你想谈谈安东尼的事。
So you wanted to talk about Anthony.

388
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:32,668
——是的。——嗯。
- Yes. - Mm-hmm.

389
00:35:32,735 --> 00:35:34,446
-那晚他和你还有我父亲在一起吗?
- Was he there that night with you and my father?

390
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:37,907
-不不不不我的过去结束了，嗯?
- No, no, no, no. We're done with my past, eh?

391
00:35:37,973 --> 00:35:39,909
我们说的是安东尼。
We're talking about Anthony.

392
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:43,412
-这与你的过去无关
- This isn't about your past.

393
00:35:43,479 --> 00:35:50,586
你是…你是我的良师益友。
You are... You were such an amazing mentor for me.

394
00:35:50,653 --> 00:35:53,489
我需要你。
And I need you.

395
00:35:53,556 --> 00:35:54,757
我真的。
I really do.

396
00:35:54,823 --> 00:35:55,958
我需要你的帮助。
I need your help.

397
00:36:00,295 --> 00:36:04,767
-你的问题都是问安东尼的。
- You know, all your questions are for Anthony.

398
00:36:22,183 --> 00:36:24,118
是的，他在那儿。
Yeah, he was there.

399
00:36:28,857 --> 00:36:30,358
-他是一个人吗?
- Was he alone?

400
00:36:30,426 --> 00:36:31,627
他带人来了吗?
Did he bring anyone?

401
00:36:31,694 --> 00:36:32,861
-重要吗?
- Does it matter?

402
00:36:36,197 --> 00:36:37,197
——没有。
- No.

403
00:36:41,704 --> 00:36:45,674
-所以你要和小斯大林打?
- So you're gonna fight Stalin Jr.?

404
00:36:45,741 --> 00:36:47,509
——没有。——哦。
- No. - Oh.

405
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:51,614
-我们要一起对抗他。
- We are going to fight him together.

406
00:36:54,984 --> 00:36:58,219
难道你不想停止躲藏吗?
Don't you wanna stop hiding?

407
00:36:58,286 --> 00:37:00,656
-不能改变过去。
- Can't change the past.

408
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:03,692
我很好。
I am fine.

409
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:05,159
我在这里很好。
I'm fine right here.

410
00:37:09,263 --> 00:37:11,165
-你怎么了?
- What happened to you?

411
00:37:14,436 --> 00:37:25,781
-你知道，我…我希望你父亲和你一样在这里。
- You know, I... I wish your father was here as much as you do.

412
00:37:25,848 --> 00:37:29,217
我知道一个人是什么感觉。
I know what it feels like to be alone.

413
00:37:31,053 --> 00:37:35,691
生活不仅仅是雇凶杀人。
There is more to life than just contract killing.

414
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,361
我现在很高兴。
I'm happy now.

415
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:42,363
就在此时此地，是的。
Right here, right now, yes.

416
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:48,704
-我为你的幸福感到高兴。
- Well, I'm happy for your happiness.

417
00:37:48,771 --> 00:37:49,805
——谢谢。
- Thank you.

418
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:59,548
但是,嗯…我不会做你的诱饵。
But, um... I am not gonna be your bait.

419
00:38:01,215 --> 00:38:03,819
-嘿，这招不错。
- Hey, it was a good move.

420
00:38:07,122 --> 00:38:09,357
-你把我教得很好
- Well, you taught me well.

421
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:15,630
等一等。
Hold on.

422
00:38:33,682 --> 00:38:37,586
关于你父亲的文件在后面两份。
The files on your dad are two in back.

423
00:38:41,255 --> 00:38:42,591
-晚安，女妖。
- Good night, Banshee.

424
00:38:44,927 --> 00:38:46,495
——谢谢。
- Thank you.

425
00:38:47,930 --> 00:38:48,930
——欢迎你。
- You're welcome.

426
00:39:23,198 --> 00:39:26,969
-玛丽亚，这位是纳瓦罗先生。
- Malia, this is Mr. Navvaro.

427
00:39:27,035 --> 00:39:30,906
他是我和我们组织的朋友。
He's a friend of myself and our organization.

428
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:43,519
——嗯…玛丽亚小姐,我……我知道，你父亲是个很有权势的人。
- Uh... Miss Malia, I... I understand, uh, your father is, uh, is a powerful man.

429
00:39:43,585 --> 00:39:45,754
-你知道他是谁
- You know who he is.

430
00:39:45,821 --> 00:39:47,388
——我做的。
- I do.

431
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,825
我想知道你是谁。
I would like to know who you are.

432
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:56,965
我还想知道你从这整件事中得到了什么?
And I also would like to know what do you get out of this whole thing?

433
00:40:02,437 --> 00:40:05,474
——保护。我只想要保护。
- Protection. All I want is protection.

434
00:40:05,541 --> 00:40:07,409
——但,是的。
- But, yeah.

435
00:40:07,476 --> 00:40:10,412
但你不能因为你父亲是个亿万富翁就得到保护。
But you don't get protection just because your father is a billionaire.

436
00:40:10,479 --> 00:40:12,414
你知道我不能同意。
You know I can't grant it.

437
00:40:19,955 --> 00:40:22,057
-在驱动器上只是一个味道。
- On that drive is just a taste.

438
00:40:22,124 --> 00:40:28,463
客户，交易，但最重要的是，大多数政府都不知道的武器设计图。
Customers, transactions, but most important, blueprints to weapons most governments don't even know about.

439
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:34,203
政府，带着他偷来的所有秘密，向前飞跃了十年。
The government, with all the secrets he's stolen, takes a leap forward by ten years.

440
00:40:34,269 --> 00:40:35,404
——正确的。
- Right.

441
00:40:37,906 --> 00:40:40,108
-都在那儿。-我想是的。
- It's all there. - I'm sure it is.

442
00:40:42,878 --> 00:40:50,619
或者都是假的，你只是在陷害我们。
Or it's all fake and you're just, uh, setting us up.

443
00:40:50,686 --> 00:40:53,655
-我才不管你们怎么想。
- I don't care what you suits think.

444
00:40:53,722 --> 00:41:01,296
我给你他所有买家的名字和他所有武器的位置，我就能得到保护。
I get you the names of all his buyers and the locations of all his weapons, and I get protection.

445
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:10,472
他是个怪物，我要你把我藏得离他越远越好。
He's a monster, and I need you to hide me as far away from him as you can.

446
00:41:22,184 --> 00:41:23,318
——正确的。
- Right.

447
00:41:25,254 --> 00:41:27,022
我去打几个电话。
I'll make some calls, yeah.

448
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,116
早上好。
Good morning.

449
00:41:54,182 --> 00:41:58,020
嗯。
Hmm.

450
00:42:05,227 --> 00:42:07,195
-事情就是这样。
- So that's what happened.

451
00:42:12,734 --> 00:42:15,704
我知道它。
I knew it.

452
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:17,673
我知道，我知道，我知道。
I knew it, I knew it, I knew it.

453
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:19,107
我就知道。
I fucking knew it.

454
00:42:24,446 --> 00:42:26,581
我的爸爸在哪里?
Where's my dad?

455
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:30,252
——继续前进。你知道什么都没变。
- Move on. You know nothing has changed.

456
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,620
什么都没有。
Nothing.

457
00:42:39,461 --> 00:42:43,532
-他们没有找到他的尸体
- They didn't recover his body.

458
00:42:43,598 --> 00:42:45,233
他可能还逍遥法外。
He could still be out there.

459
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:49,237
-女妖，我看见他倒下了。
- Banshee, I saw him go down.

460
00:42:57,746 --> 00:43:01,683
-但他们没找到他
- But they didn't find him.

461
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,518
他可能还逍遥法外。
He could still be out there.

462
00:43:05,053 --> 00:43:10,826
你知道吗，我昨天告诉你了，那是…-这是问安东尼的问题。
- You know, I-I-I told you yesterday, that's, uh... - That's a question for Anthony.

463
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,101
——早上好。
- Good morning.

464
00:43:34,883 --> 00:43:37,886
-我打扰到什么了吗?
- Am I interrupting something?

465
00:43:37,953 --> 00:43:38,820
-哦,不。
- Uh, no.

466
00:43:38,887 --> 00:43:42,190
就是喝杯咖啡而已。
Just, uh, having a cup of coffee.

467
00:43:42,257 --> 00:43:46,395
说到这个，我该走了。
Speaking of which, uh, I should be going.

468
00:43:46,462 --> 00:43:47,996
啊。
Ugh.

469
00:43:49,297 --> 00:43:53,935
D，如果有什么事就给酒馆打电话。
D, call the tavern if anything comes up.

470
00:44:10,218 --> 00:44:13,288
-这个酒吧有一个前门和一个后门，通向一个停车场。
- The pub has a front and a back door that leads to a parking lot.

471
00:44:13,355 --> 00:44:16,358
这是很简单的。
It's pretty straightforward.

472
00:44:16,426 --> 00:44:19,661
-凯勒一点都不坦率
- There's nothing straightforward about Caleb.

473
00:44:19,728 --> 00:44:21,596
房子呢?
What about the house?

474
00:44:23,932 --> 00:44:27,569
-被树林包围的死胡同。
- Dead-end streets surrounded by woods.

475
00:44:27,636 --> 00:44:29,304
-女妖可能在那里。
- Banshee's probably there.

476
00:44:29,371 --> 00:44:32,340
也就是说凯勒知道你要来
That means Caleb knows that you're coming.

477
00:44:32,408 --> 00:44:34,276
——我们要来吗?
- We're coming?

478
00:44:34,342 --> 00:44:35,610
你不去吗?
Are you not going?

479
00:44:35,677 --> 00:44:37,746
-天啊，你知道吗?
- Oh, Jesus Christ, you know what?

480
00:44:37,813 --> 00:44:40,382
你想再问我一次吗?
You want to question me again?

481
00:44:40,450 --> 00:44:41,817
请。
Please.

482
00:44:41,883 --> 00:44:44,520
我需要再找一个助手吗?
Do I need to find another assistant?

483
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:47,923
多久?
How long?

484
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:50,959
- 6个小时左右
- Um, six hours or so.

485
00:44:53,895 --> 00:44:56,532
打电话给费城队。
Call the Philly team.

486
00:44:56,598 --> 00:44:58,700
-你在想什么?
- What are you thinking?

487
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,669
——两个团队。
- Two teams.

488
00:45:00,735 --> 00:45:03,705
一个占领房子，一个占领酒馆。
One takes the house, one takes the tavern.

489
00:45:03,772 --> 00:45:05,575
他们一小时内就能到。
They can be there within the hour.

490
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:14,049
告诉去老井的队员们，要低调，要安静。
And tell the team that goes to the Old Well, you know, be subtle, be quiet.

491
00:45:14,116 --> 00:45:15,984
迦勒是聪明。这可能都是不可能的。
Caleb is smart. It may all be for not.

492
00:45:16,051 --> 00:45:17,953
告诉他们就位后给我发短信。
Tell them to text me when they're in position.

493
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:19,788
——明白了。
- Got it.

494
00:45:19,855 --> 00:45:23,526
提醒他们我要活捉他
- And remind them I want him alive.

495
00:45:23,593 --> 00:45:27,295
活蹦乱跳，因为他是我的。
Alive and kicking 'cause he's mine.

496
00:45:27,362 --> 00:45:30,765
你明白了吗?——明白了。
You got it? - Got it.

497
00:45:30,832 --> 00:45:32,300
-那就赶紧打电话
- So make the damn call.

498
00:45:35,237 --> 00:45:39,509
你，给我找个外卖。我饿死了。
You, find me a take-away. I'm starving.

499
00:46:02,664 --> 00:46:05,667
-好吧，我们15点出发。
- All right, so we head out at 1500.

500
00:46:05,734 --> 00:46:08,069
不早不晚。
No sooner, no later.

501
00:46:08,136 --> 00:46:11,607
无论如何不要走主干道。
Stay off the main road at all cost.

502
00:46:11,673 --> 00:46:15,243
我们不希望宴会上有不速之客。
We wouldn't want any uninvited guest during the party.

503
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:19,415
现在，当我们到达市郊时，我们遇到了麻烦。
Now, when we reach the outskirts of town, we hit dirt.

504
00:46:19,482 --> 00:46:25,086
现在都是越野直到我们在七公里外找到一个旧包装厂。
Now, all off-road until we find an old packing house about seven clicks out.

505
00:46:25,153 --> 00:46:28,790
在那里，移交给中央情报局的工作发生了。
There, the handoff to the CIA happens.

506
00:46:28,857 --> 00:46:33,795
男女特工，他们会将玛利亚和她的车保护性拘留。
Male and female agents, they will take Malia and her drives into protective custody.

507
00:46:33,862 --> 00:46:35,498
好吗?幸福吗?
Good? Happiness?

508
00:46:35,565 --> 00:46:39,367
好了，喝点咖啡，睡个午觉，准备好。
All right, so get some coffee, take a nap, and be ready.

509
00:46:43,271 --> 00:46:45,340
——杰里米等。-这是什么?
- Jeremy, wait. - What is it?

510
00:46:45,408 --> 00:46:49,711
-听起来不错，Navvaro先生。
- This all sounds great, Mr. Navvaro.

511
00:46:49,778 --> 00:46:51,713
但是呢?
But?

512
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:54,517
-但是没有备用方案。
- But there's no Plan B.

513
00:46:54,584 --> 00:46:55,685
-这是例行行动。
- This is a routine op.

514
00:46:55,750 --> 00:47:00,456
我们做过几百次了，我相信我的人，相信我。
We have done it hundreds of times, and I trust my men, believe me.

515
00:47:00,523 --> 00:47:07,430
-看来你对我父亲的人采取了一切预防措施，他们现在肯定在外面找我。
- Seems as though you've taken every precaution against my father's men, who are definitely out there hunting for me right now.

516
00:47:07,496 --> 00:47:11,800
但你对自己的人毫无防备。
But you've taken no precautions against your own men.

517
00:47:13,368 --> 00:47:21,042
-玛丽亚，容我说一句，随着交接的临近，有点紧张甚至偏执是正常的。
- Malia, if I may, it is normal to be a little nervous or even paranoid as we get closer to the handoff.

518
00:47:21,109 --> 00:47:26,081
——这是. .,但是……-偏执还是粗心更理性?
- Is it.. - But... - More rational to be paranoid or careless?

519
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:29,284
我在这里冒着生命危险。
I am risking everything being here.

520
00:47:29,351 --> 00:47:32,220
你不知道如果他抓到我，会对我做什么。
You have no idea what he'll do to me if he catches me.

521
00:47:32,287 --> 00:47:36,391
我已经履行了我的承诺，我希望你也这样做。
I've held up my end of the bargain, and I expect you to do the same.

522
00:47:36,459 --> 00:47:38,827
——我们。
- We are.

523
00:47:41,229 --> 00:47:43,365
你见过我要移交给谁的探员吗?
Have you met the agents I'm being handed off to?

524
00:47:43,432 --> 00:47:44,467
——当然。
- Of course.

525
00:47:44,533 --> 00:47:47,503
他们是有最高权限的中情局特工。
They are CIA agents with top clearance.

526
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:50,473
-中情局一直是最值得信赖的机构。
- The CIA's always been the most trustworthy organization.

527
00:47:50,539 --> 00:47:53,275
-让我们做我们的工作，玛丽亚。
- Let us do our job, Malia.

528
00:47:53,341 --> 00:47:58,681
六个月后，你想住哪儿就住哪儿想做什么就做什么。
In six months, you will be living wherever you want and doing whatever the fuck you want.

529
00:48:00,483 --> 00:48:02,317
相信我,好吗?
Trust me, okay?

530
00:48:02,384 --> 00:48:03,952
好吧。
Okay.

531
00:48:09,024 --> 00:48:11,226
-嘿，没关系。
- Hey, it's okay.

532
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:59,635
-曾经是我的最爱之一。
- Used to be one of my favorites.

533
00:49:59,702 --> 00:50:02,370
——用于?
- Used to?

534
00:50:02,438 --> 00:50:04,673
-知道结局的回忆就糟透了。
- Memories suck when you know how they end.

535
00:50:09,512 --> 00:50:11,814
你是怎么想的?
So what's your deal?

536
00:50:11,881 --> 00:50:13,948
——我的交易?
- My deal?

537
00:50:14,015 --> 00:50:19,422
-你是来找我爸爸帮忙的，但你什么都没做，只吃和盯着我家人的照片看。
- You came here to get my dad's help, but you haven't done anything but eat and stare at photos of my family.

538
00:50:22,991 --> 00:50:24,527
你们是情人吗?
Were you lovers or something?

539
00:50:24,593 --> 00:50:27,362
不。
No.

540
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:31,500
我七岁时就认识他了。
I've known him since I was seven.

541
00:50:31,567 --> 00:50:32,967
-他有危险吗?
- Is he in danger?

542
00:50:35,704 --> 00:50:38,874
听着，我知道他和黑帮在一起很危险。
Look, I know he's in danger with the mob.

543
00:50:38,940 --> 00:50:41,444
我看了桌子上你的档案。
I looked at your file on the table.

544
00:50:41,510 --> 00:50:42,888
你是政府还是什么?
Are you with the government or something?

545
00:50:42,912 --> 00:50:44,152
-你不应该那样做的。
- You shouldn't have done that.

546
00:50:44,212 --> 00:50:45,581
——我很抱歉。我没办法。
- I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

547
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:47,426
我觉得他有危险，他是我唯一的亲人。
I feel like he's in danger, and he is all I have left.

548
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:52,855
如果他有危险，我得知道，因为我不会让任何事…——停止!
Hey, if he's in danger, I need to know, because I will not let anything... - Stop!

549
00:50:52,922 --> 00:50:55,356
我是来帮你的。

00:51:02,397 --> 00:51:03,998
坐下。
Sit.

553
00:51:31,092 --> 00:51:33,995
-强硬，但安静的酒吧老板。
- Tough, but quiet bar owner.

554
00:51:34,062 --> 00:51:36,297
爱死它了。
Love it.

555
00:51:36,364 --> 00:51:38,467
我们先喝三杯啤酒。
Let's start with, uh, three beers.

556

——确定。

557
00:51:42,136 --> 00:51:43,839
好吧。
All right.

558
00:51:43,906 --> 00:51:45,073
-还有菜单。
- And some menus.

559
00:51:45,139 --> 00:51:49,979
-哦，对不起，但是，呃，厨师病了。
- Oh, I'm sorry, but, uh, the cook is sick.

560
00:51:50,044 --> 00:51:52,681
-那好吧。
- That's fine then.

561
00:51:52,748 --> 00:51:54,617
实际上,我们庆祝。
We're celebrating, actually.

562
00:51:54,683 --> 00:51:56,384
——好的。
- All right.

563
00:51:56,452 --> 00:51:59,020
-是的，我儿子要结婚了。
- Yep, my son's getting married.

564
00:51:59,087 --> 00:52:00,523
——哦,哇。
- Oh, wow.

565
00:52:00,589 --> 00:52:05,260
没人说婚礼地点会像威尔堡。
Well, nothing says wedding destination like Wellburg.

566
00:52:05,326 --> 00:52:07,161
啊!
Ah!

567
00:52:07,228 --> 00:52:08,363
-他在这里长大。-是的。
- He grew up here. - Yeah.

568
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:12,935
-这就像是在他迈出人生的下一步之前的最后一点怀旧之情。
- It's like one last bit of nostalgia before he takes that next big step in life.

569
00:52:13,002 --> 00:52:17,105
-嘿，你知道吗，你看起来比他开心。
- Hey, you know, you seem happier about it than he is.

570
00:52:23,445 --> 00:52:25,481
-我能说什么呢?
- Ah, what can I say?

571
00:52:25,548 --> 00:52:27,416
我猜他知道自己在做什么。
Guess he knows what he's getting himself into.

572
00:52:27,483 --> 00:52:29,083
是的,这是真的。
Yeah, it's true.

573
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,686
对不起,先生们。
Excuse me, gentlemen.

574
00:52:39,528 --> 00:52:41,697
-他们就位了。——好。
- They're in position. - Good.

575
00:52:41,764 --> 00:52:43,364
放手去做吧。
Give them the go.

576
00:52:43,432 --> 00:52:45,568
让另一队去搜房子。
And tell the other team to hit the house.

577
00:52:45,634 --> 00:52:51,507
确保他们找到我的任何把柄，在我到达之前保证他的生命安全。
And make sure they find anything they may have on me, and to keep him alive until I get there.

578
00:53:04,118 --> 00:53:06,789
-我没怎么读。
- I didn't read much of it.

579
00:53:06,855 --> 00:53:11,627
我只看到了尸体的照片还有像核密码之类的流行语。
I just saw pictures of bodies and buzz words like nuclear codes.

580
00:53:14,395 --> 00:53:17,700
人们会来这里吗?
Are people coming here?

581
00:53:17,766 --> 00:53:19,802
——是的。
- Yes.

582
00:53:19,868 --> 00:53:21,269
-我们该怎么办?

583
00:53:40,154 --> 00:53:42,958
这是我的爸爸。
It's my dad.

584
00:53:44,258 --> 00:53:45,259
——嘿,宝贝。
- Hey, Baby.

585
00:53:45,326 --> 00:53:48,797
你看，我忘了告诉你修理工要来了。
You see, I forgot to tell you that the repairman is coming by.

586
00:53:48,864 --> 00:53:49,932
——它们在这里。
- They're here.

587
00:53:56,939 --> 00:54:00,174
-好的，我会尽快赶到的。
- Yeah, I'll be there as soon as I can, yeah.

588
00:54:00,241 --> 00:54:02,210
是啊，替我亲一下宝宝。
Uh, yeah, give a kiss to the baby for me.

589
00:54:02,276 --> 00:54:04,580
——我会的。——谢谢。再见。
- I will. - Thank you. Bye.

590
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:08,182
-把枪拿来。
- Get your gun.

591
00:54:08,249 --> 00:54:09,985
现在!
Now!

592
00:54:36,945 --> 00:54:41,650
-诚实…我见过更糟的。
- Honestly... I have seen worse.

593
00:54:41,717 --> 00:54:44,352
我是说，你演得非常好，非常好。
I mean, you were very good, very good.

594
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,988
但这两个吗?
But these two?

595
00:54:46,055 --> 00:54:47,990
它们就像湿毛巾一样。
They preform like wet towels.

596
00:55:16,185 --> 00:55:17,419
——三个入口。还有其他的吗?
- Three entrances. Any others?

597
00:55:17,486 --> 00:55:19,521
-地下室入口从大厅出来。
- Basement entrance comes out down the hall.

598
00:55:19,588 --> 00:55:21,857
海莉，我要你上楼，把自己锁在房间里。
- Hailey, I want you to go upstairs, lock yourself in your room.

599
00:55:21,924 --> 00:55:23,233
在我说安全之前不要出来。
And do not come out until I say it's clear.

600
00:55:23,257 --> 00:55:24,827
-我不会丢下你一个人的
- I'm not leaving you alone.

601
00:55:25,994 --> 00:55:27,062
Hailey,走吧!
- Hailey, go!

602
00:57:30,919 --> 00:57:32,888
-放开我!
- Let me go!

603
00:57:45,534 --> 00:57:47,169

604
00:58:00,883 --> 00:58:02,017
——别担心。

605
00:58:02,084 --> 00:58:03,886
你走后我会照顾你女儿的。
I'll take care of your girl when you're gone.

606
00:59:07,382 --> 00:59:08,850

607
00:59:08,917 --> 00:59:09,917
婴儿。

嘿,宝贝。

嗯…嘿…她需要知道真相在她听到谎言之前。

611
00:59:51,193 --> 00:59:54,162
-很抱歉我之前没有告诉你。
- I'm so sorry I didn't tell you this before.

612

613
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:56,408
-没事，没事，没事。

614
00:59:56,432 --> 00:59:58,500
——嗯,是吗?

615
00:59:58,567 --> 01:00:00,235
我，你知道，我训练过你。
I, you know, I have trained you.

616
01:00:00,302 --> 01:00:05,340
你要听……到D，对吧?
And you have to listen to... To D now, all right?

617
01:00:05,408 --> 01:00:07,175
你理解我吗?

618
01:00:07,242 --> 01:00:08,343
——我明白了。

619
01:00:08,411 --> 01:00:11,213

隐藏她的。

621
01:00:19,187 --> 01:00:20,423
——我会的。
- I will.

622
01:00:24,593 --> 01:00:26,561
-你知道他们想要她，对吧?
- You know they want her, right?

623
01:00:26,628 --> 01:00:28,498
——是的。
- Yes.

624
01:00:30,732 --> 01:00:37,039
-嘿，宝贝，你…你是我生命中最美好的事。
- Hey, Baby, you're... you're the best thing that ever happened to me.

625
01:01:06,268 --> 01:01:08,236
-有房子的那队怎么说?
- What's the word on the team that had the house?

626
01:01:08,303 --> 01:01:10,473
-没什么。
- Not a thing.

627
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,040
-好吧，他们死了。

628
01:01:12,107 --> 01:01:15,777
-我是说，也许他们只是在等…-不，他们死了。
- I mean, maybe they're just waiting... - Nah, they're dead.

629
01:01:15,844 --> 01:01:17,579
那些侦察员呢?

630
01:01:17,646 --> 01:01:19,881
-他们已经就位了
- They're in position now.

631

Caleb's car's there, but no sign of him or Banshee.

632
01:01:23,952 --> 01:01:27,155
-所以他们躲在房子里等我们
- So they're holed up in the house waiting for us.

633
01:01:29,492 --> 01:01:31,159
你听到什么?

634
01:01:31,226 --> 01:01:33,895
-我们三个人死在酒馆里了
- Our three are dead inside the tavern.

635
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:36,298
-有什么能把他们和我们联系起来的吗?
- And is there anything to link them back to us?

636
01:01:36,364 --> 01:01:38,166
-警察认为是抢劫出了差错
- Cops think it was a robbery gone wrong.

637
01:01:38,233 --> 01:01:39,935
他们正在寻找失主。
They're trying to find the owner.

638
01:01:40,001 --> 01:01:43,238
-我们还要多久才能得到支援?
- How long before we get some backup?

639
01:01:43,305 --> 01:01:45,016
-又有一队人从城里过来了。
- There's another team coming from the city now.

640
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,309
他们三小时后到。

641
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,512
-让他们快点
- Ugh, make sure they hustle.

642
01:01:49,579 --> 01:01:50,912
我要这些混蛋。
I want these assholes.

643
01:01:50,979 --> 01:01:53,615
-如果他们跑了怎么办?——在哪里?

644
01:01:53,682 --> 01:01:55,451
出城只有一条路。

645
01:01:55,518 --> 01:01:56,918
侦察员会看到他们的。

646
01:01:56,985 --> 01:01:59,855
所以现在，我们就坐着等待吧。
So now, we just sit back and we play the waiting game.

647
01:02:33,855 --> 01:02:35,724
-他想让我知道什么?

648
01:02:38,594 --> 01:02:40,362
-他是谁的真相
- The truth about who he was.

649
01:02:48,036 --> 01:02:52,007
中央情报局派了一个叫安东尼的人去杀他们。
The CIA sent a man named Anthony to kill them.

650
01:02:52,073 --> 01:02:57,913
他们说他们是叛徒，把证人的情报卖给俄国人。
They said that they were traitors selling witnesses' intel to the Russians.

651
01:02:59,948 --> 01:03:02,784
-中情局为什么要这么做?
- Why would the CIA do that?

652
01:03:04,819 --> 01:03:06,455
-他们老了。
- They were getting old.

653
01:03:06,522 --> 01:03:08,658
他们太强大了，知道的太多了。
They were too powerful, and they knew too much.

654
01:04:29,505 --> 01:04:30,673
——操!
- Fuck!

655
01:04:49,257 --> 01:04:51,393
-凯勒躲起来了
- Caleb went into hiding.

656
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:53,161
我父亲中枪了。
My father had been shot.

657
01:04:53,228 --> 01:04:54,896
安东尼的弟弟被杀了。

658
01:04:59,267 --> 01:05:02,705
-所以安东尼会来这里?

659
01:05:02,772 --> 01:05:07,208
-我希望如此。
- I fucking hope so.

660
01:05:07,275 --> 01:05:11,514
——好。
- Good.

661
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:14,883
你有什么计划吗?
Do you have a plan?

662
01:05:14,949 --> 01:05:20,322
-我正在研究。
- I'm working on one.

663
01:05:20,388 --> 01:05:22,157
-跟我来。
- Come with me.

664
01:05:32,802 --> 01:05:34,069
这个会有帮助吗?
Will this help?

665
01:05:49,184 --> 01:05:50,952
-他都留着?
- He kept all these?

666
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:52,755
-他有信任问题。
- He had trust issues.

667
01:05:55,857 --> 01:05:57,593
幸运的我。
Lucky me.

668
01:06:06,935 --> 01:06:09,739
我们应该去楼上。这对我们有利。
We should take the upstairs. It'll be to our advantage.

669
01:06:09,805 --> 01:06:12,073
-我爸爸说如果你不能移动，你就死定了。
- My dad said if you aren't mobile, you're dead.

670
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,241
-通常情况下是这样的。
- Normally, that's true.

671
01:06:13,308 --> 01:06:16,878
但如果我们走，他们会找到我们的。
But if we go anywhere, they'll find us.

672
01:06:16,945 --> 01:06:19,013
这房子是我们的地盘。
This house is our territory.

673
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,016
这对我们有利。
It's advantageous to us.

674
01:06:22,083 --> 01:06:24,285
-他们不会把我们烧光吗?——没有。
- Won't they just burn us out? - No way.

675
01:06:24,352 --> 01:06:26,856
他们需要凯勒的尸体作为杀人的证据。
They need Caleb's body as proof of kill.

676
01:06:26,921 --> 01:06:29,242
有人悬赏我的人头，所以他们也会想要我的。
I have a price on my head, so they'll wanna collect that too.

677
01:06:48,209 --> 01:06:50,546
-你有多少?
- How many you got?

678
01:06:50,613 --> 01:06:51,714
——足够。

679
01:06:54,784 --> 01:06:56,419
-让他们进来。
- Send them in.

680
01:07:27,382 --> 01:07:30,553
-他到底是什么样的人?
- What was he really like?

681
01:07:30,619 --> 01:07:32,053
——什么?
- What?

682
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:36,525
——我的爸爸。他到底是什么样的人?
- My dad. What was he really like?

683
01:07:36,592 --> 01:07:39,127
-我想你最了解他。
- I think you probably knew him best.

684
01:07:39,194 --> 01:07:41,329
你只是认识另一个版本的他。
You just knew a different version of him.

685
01:07:44,867 --> 01:07:46,067
-你知道哪个版本?
- Which version did you know?

686
01:07:49,872 --> 01:07:54,810
我认识那个高大强壮的混蛋凯勒。
I knew the big, strong, I'm-a-bad-ass Caleb.

687
01:07:58,379 --> 01:08:04,152
他有坚硬的外壳，但是…他对某些人有好感。
He had a hard shell, but... he had a soft spot for a few people.

688
01:08:13,929 --> 01:08:16,899
-你失去父母是什么感觉?
- What was it like when you lost your parents?

689
01:08:20,836 --> 01:08:23,739
-很难。
- It was hard.

690
01:08:23,806 --> 01:08:26,642
我很生气。
I was angry.

691
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:33,716
但我只是低调行事，专注于工作，专注于回报。
But I just kept my head down, focused on the work, and eye on the prize.

692
01:08:42,156 --> 01:08:45,093
-所以他真的没提过我们?
- So he really never mentioned us?

693
01:08:45,159 --> 01:08:46,662
——没有。
- No.

694
01:08:49,330 --> 01:08:53,736
也就是说他爱你胜过一切。
Which means he loved you more than anything.

695
01:08:53,802 --> 01:08:56,972
他在保护你的安全即使是在他最信任的人面前。
He was protecting your safety even from the ones that he trusted the most.

696
01:09:06,347 --> 01:09:11,987
-所以你猜现在只有我们了?
- So you guess it's just us now?

697
01:09:12,053 --> 01:09:13,288
——是的。
- Yes.

698
01:09:17,325 --> 01:09:20,696
——这很好。
- That's fine.

699
01:09:20,763 --> 01:09:22,163
有点像你。
Kinda like you.

700
01:09:25,366 --> 01:09:27,302
-有点像你。
- Kinda like you too.

701
01:10:00,168 --> 01:10:02,871
-他们为什么不出去?
- Why are they not getting out?

702
01:10:21,255 --> 01:10:23,224
——来到这里。
- Come here.

703
01:10:26,895 --> 01:10:28,329
-你在干什么?
- What are you doing?

704
01:10:28,396 --> 01:10:31,299
-他们用的是热能。我们需要注册为一个。
- They're using thermal. We need to register as one.

705
01:10:48,984 --> 01:10:51,053
-前门好像被钉上了。
- Looks like the front door is boarded up.

706
01:10:54,255 --> 01:10:56,157
——对讲机。
- Walkie.

707
01:10:56,224 --> 01:10:57,793
绕到后面去。
Go around the back.

708
01:10:57,860 --> 01:10:59,094
确保它是一样的。
Make sure it's the same.

709
01:10:59,160 --> 01:11:00,160
——收到。
- Roger that.

710
01:11:29,491 --> 01:11:30,759
-两个男人穿过院子。
- Two guys across the yard.

711
01:11:33,529 --> 01:11:36,364
-后门也被封死了。
- Back door's boarded up too.

712
01:11:36,432 --> 01:11:38,033
-他们把它封起来就走了吗?
- Did they just board it up and leave?

713
01:11:45,641 --> 01:11:52,648
-我只看到一张热成像，所以你他妈在说什么?
- All I'm seeing is one thermal image, so what the fuck are you talking about?

714
01:11:52,715 --> 01:11:54,950
楼下有生命迹象吗?
- Is there any sign of life downstairs?

715
01:11:55,017 --> 01:11:58,187
- 没有。我绕到后面去。
- Negative. I'll go around back.

716
01:11:58,252 --> 01:12:00,022
-长官，如果这是个陷阱呢?
- Sir, what if it's a trap?

717
01:12:00,089 --> 01:12:01,724
-这当然是个陷阱
- Of course it's a trap.

718
01:12:01,790 --> 01:12:04,258
但我得知道第二个人是谁。
But I need to know who the second person is.

719
01:12:04,325 --> 01:12:08,864
趁凯勒还没上节目，用这个查清楚。
Use this to find out before Caleb's on.

720
01:12:11,767 --> 01:12:12,801
是时候了。
It's time.

721
01:12:35,424 --> 01:12:38,326
——嘿,女妖!
- Hey, Banshee!

722
01:12:40,195 --> 01:12:43,932
小婊子!小婊子!
Little bitch! Little bitch!

723
01:12:43,999 --> 01:12:46,969
时间玩!
Time to play!

724
01:12:47,035 --> 01:12:48,904
来吧,女妖。
Come on, Banshee.

725
01:12:50,405 --> 01:12:52,808
我知道你在里面。
I know you're in there.

726
01:12:55,711 --> 01:12:58,981
-小丹，别担心我!

727
01:12:59,047 --> 01:13:00,348
杀了这个混蛋!
Kill this bastard!

728
01:13:07,022 --> 01:13:12,461
——女妖……你真的要让你儿子死吗?
- Banshee... are you really going to let your boy die?

729
01:13:15,329 --> 01:13:16,765
——做点什么。
- Do something.

730
01:13:16,832 --> 01:13:19,201
——我不能。
- I can't.

731
01:13:19,268 --> 01:13:22,404
安东尼是唯一知道我父亲的人。
Anthony's the only one who knows about my father.

732
01:13:24,273 --> 01:13:26,408
——哦!
- Oh!

733
01:13:30,979 --> 01:13:33,081
后面还有三个人。

01:13:44,660 --> 01:13:46,420
-三个在后面!他们进来!
- Three going around back! They're coming in!

736
01:15:03,138 --> 01:15:06,208
-哦，该死的!
- Oh, fucking Christ!

737
01:15:08,577 --> 01:15:11,246
匆忙的房子!匆忙的房子!
Rush the house! Rush the house!

738
01:15:40,575 --> 01:15:41,576
-最近怎么样?
- How's it going?

739
01:15:41,643 --> 01:15:43,078
——太棒了!
- Not great!

740
01:16:43,271 --> 01:16:44,573
他妈的没用。
Fucking useless.

741
01:16:47,209 --> 01:16:49,511
他们一直在踢他们，然后他们就走了!
They keep kicking them before they go off!

742
01:16:49,578 --> 01:16:51,447
-煮熟-什么
- Cook 'em. - What?

743
01:16:51,513 --> 01:16:52,581
-煮手榴弹。
- Cook 'the grenades.

744
01:16:52,647 --> 01:16:54,282
-我不知道那是什么意思!
- I don't know what that means!

745
01:16:54,349 --> 01:16:56,585
-扔之前先握几秒钟。
- Hold them for a few seconds before you throw them.

746
01:17:01,556 --> 01:17:06,061
-一，二，三…
- One, two, three...

747
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:19,307
-你有枪吗?
- You got a gun?

748
01:17:27,517 --> 01:17:29,184
你现在所做的。
You do now.

749
01:17:31,086 --> 01:17:32,587

751
01:18:02,284 --> 01:18:03,852
-盯着安东尼?-我不知道!

752
01:18:03,919 --> 01:18:05,120
他们都戴着面具!
They're all wearing masks!

753
01:18:05,187 --> 01:18:07,355
-那混蛋想拖垮我们。

754
01:19:34,342 --> 01:19:35,877
现在上楼。
Go upstairs now.

755
01:19:55,096 --> 01:19:56,798
他妈的!
Fuck!

01:20:16,718 --> 01:20:19,221
——走吧。走，走，走，走!

757
01:20:36,672 --> 01:20:38,708
——最后。
- Finally.

758
01:20:38,773 --> 01:20:40,375
——滚蛋。
- Fuck off.

759
01:20:45,213 --> 01:20:46,881
你还有活着的人吗?

760
01:20:46,948 --> 01:20:50,486
-我不知道。我想他们都死了。
- I don't know. I think they're all dead.

761
01:20:53,021 --> 01:20:55,591
-不，我做不到

762

763
01:20:57,727 --> 01:20:59,094
听我的。
Listen to me.

764
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,296
我们在那栋楼里找到的人，都要活捉。
Who we find in that building, I want them alive.

765
01:21:01,363 --> 01:21:02,831
你是认真的吗?
- Are you serious?

766
01:21:02,897 --> 01:21:04,266
-我是认真的。
- Yeah, I'm serious.

767
01:21:04,332 --> 01:21:07,235
在我把它们放进尸袋之前，我是认真的。
Until I put them in body bags, I'm very serious.

768
01:21:07,302 --> 01:21:08,302
走了。
Go.

769
01:21:18,514 --> 01:21:20,716
他妈的。

看看你，姑娘。
Look at you, girl.

好工作。
Good job.

774
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,764
迦勒在哪儿?
Where's Caleb?

775
01:21:37,700 --> 01:21:39,435
走,走,走!
Go, go, go!

776
01:22:09,998 --> 01:22:12,334
迦勒在哪儿?
Where's Caleb?

777
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:13,703
-我有个主意。
- I have an idea.

778
01:22:13,769 --> 01:22:15,647
把你的男人从那女孩身上拿开怎么样?
How about you get your fucking dudes off the girl?

779
01:22:15,671 --> 01:22:20,008
我告诉你凯勒在哪里，你告诉我我父亲在哪里，大家就皆大欢喜了。
I'll tell you where Caleb is, you tell me where my father is, everybody's fucking happy.

780
01:22:22,611 --> 01:22:25,748
-我不记得你父亲在哪了。
- I don't recall where your father is.

781
01:22:25,815 --> 01:22:27,048
-你是个骗子。
- You're a liar.

782
01:22:27,115 --> 01:22:29,485
你知道吗?你是对的。
You know what? You're right.

783
01:22:29,552 --> 01:22:31,052
我确实记得。
I do recall.

784
01:22:31,119 --> 01:22:35,190
我最后一次见他的时候，有几个人把他打得屁滚尿流。
The last time I seen him, there was a couple of guys beating the shit out of him.

785
01:22:35,256 --> 01:22:37,225
他躺在血泊中。
And he was lying in a pool of blood.

786
01:22:37,292 --> 01:22:39,762
愚蠢的我。
Silly me.

787
01:22:54,943 --> 01:22:56,512
-他妈的给我进来!
- Get the fuck in here!

788
01:22:56,579 --> 01:22:59,648
-对一个十几岁的女孩来说有点多了!
- Feels like a little much for a teenage girl!

789
01:23:02,785 --> 01:23:04,520
-他们没找到尸体
- They never found a body.

790
01:23:06,489 --> 01:23:11,326
-或者因为你父亲是个叛徒，他跑了。
- Or because your father's a traitor, and he ran away.

791
01:23:11,393 --> 01:23:13,328
——是错误的。把它们从那该死的女孩身上拿开!
- Wrong. Get them off the fucking girl!

792
01:23:24,707 --> 01:23:28,611
——迦勒在哪儿?
- Where's Caleb?

793
01:23:28,677 --> 01:23:31,814
-埋在后院里。
- Buried in the back yard.

794
01:23:31,881 --> 01:23:35,316
-现在你让我生气了，因为我知道你在撒谎!
- Now you're upsetting me because I know you're lying!

795
01:23:35,383 --> 01:23:43,124
因为凯勒杀了我的人后，我知道他回来了。
'Cause after Caleb shot my men, I know he came back here.

796
01:23:43,191 --> 01:23:44,693
他他妈的在哪儿?
Where the fuck is he?

797
01:23:55,103 --> 01:23:57,406
-你觉得很难受?
- Oh, you're feeling tough?

798
01:23:57,473 --> 01:23:58,574
好吧。
Okay.

799
01:24:00,576 --> 01:24:03,612
我们用老办法吧。
Let's do this old school.

800
01:24:21,864 --> 01:24:23,799
——她开枪!
- Shoot her!

801
01:25:20,021 --> 01:25:22,056
她开枪!
Shoot her!

802
01:25:57,158 --> 01:25:59,127
-是的。嘿,嘿,嘿。
- Yeah. Hey, hey, hey.

803
01:26:01,396 --> 01:26:10,573
在那里……他妈的……是……迦勒?
Where... the fuck... is... Caleb?

804
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:11,740
嗯?
Huh?

805
01:26:11,807 --> 01:26:15,010
-你出拳像个小贱人。
- You punch like a little fucking bitch.

806
01:26:15,076 --> 01:26:17,446
嘿,混蛋。
- Hey, asshole.

807
01:26:17,513 --> 01:26:19,113
去你妈的。
Fuck you.

808
01:26:23,151 --> 01:26:24,720
——操。
- Fuck.

809
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:16,170
-还有吗?
- Are there more?

810
01:27:16,237 --> 01:27:18,306
-我希望不是。
- I hope not.

811
01:27:21,777 --> 01:27:25,313
-我今天中枪了。
- I got shot today.

812
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,850
-我也中枪了。
- I got shot too.

813
01:27:27,916 --> 01:27:31,720
——没有。我被击中。
- No. I got shot.

814
01:27:31,787 --> 01:27:33,055
在肩膀上。
In the shoulder.

815
01:27:36,825 --> 01:27:39,662
-只是皮肉伤。你会好的。
- It's a flesh wound. You'll be okay.

816
01:27:45,134 --> 01:27:46,702
- - - - - -接下来是什么?
- What's next?

817
01:27:46,769 --> 01:27:48,904
会有更多的人向我们开枪吗?
Are more people gonna shoot at us?

818
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:55,411
——可能。
- Probably.

819
01:27:58,414 --> 01:28:01,083
这取决于我们去哪里，去找谁。
It just depends on where we go and who we go after.

820
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:09,323
但现在，我们还是去酒店房间喝杯鸡尾酒，吃块牛排吧。
But for now, let's just get a cocktail and a steak in a hotel room.

821
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:11,359
-我没什么想做的。
