In February 1915, the Turkish army
began a crackdown on the Armenian people. </ i>

2
00:00:31,452 --> 00:00:32,597
Sometime later ...</ i>

3
00:00:32,853 --> 00:00:36,430
thousands of survivors of this
genocide came to France. </ i>

4
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:39,765
To survive and integrate ...</ i>

5
00:00:40,027 --> 00:00:42,928
most Armenians chose
hard work and sacrifices. </ i>

6
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:46,356
Some did not. </ i>

7
00:00:48,102 --> 00:00:50,371
The Malakian clan was one of those. </ i>

INSIDE RING

9
00:02:10,317 --> 00:02:13,611
- Want something?
- No. Be quick.

10
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:38,926
Sorry.

11
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:41,457
Take it easy!

12
00:02:42,883 --> 00:02:45,021
- Let's talk politely.
- Politely?

13
00:02:45,752 --> 00:02:47,345
Are you kidding?

14
00:02:47,622 --> 00:02:49,955
Come on, get your documents.

15
00:03:01,401 --> 00:03:03,789
Get your things and get out there!

16
00:04:44,404 --> 00:04:48,201
As police
you face danger every day.

17
00:04:49,076 --> 00:04:50,636
Mortal danger.

18
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:56,470
Some people
don't respect human life.

19
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:58,874
Starting with you.

20
00:05:01,054 --> 00:05:04,402
Carrying a weapon means
being prepared to kill ...

21
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:06,644
but also to die.

22
00:05:06,927 --> 00:05:10,701
You will face situations that
may be classified into 4 categories.

23
00:05:11,063 --> 00:05:12,492
Colours.

24
00:05:12,766 --> 00:05:16,343
First we have White.
Total absence of danger.

25
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,445
I need not dwell here.
For cops, it rarely happens.

26
00:05:22,376 --> 00:05:24,286
Yellow: awareness of the environment.

27
00:05:24,578 --> 00:05:27,512
You are walking calmly
but anything can happen.

28
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,052
Orange: possible danger.

29
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:32,237
Demonstrations
control routines ...

30
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,079
all senses
are on alert ...

31
00:05:34,354 --> 00:05:36,590
in order to anticipate action.

32
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:39,551
Finally, red.

33
00:05:39,827 --> 00:05:41,768
Red is real threat.

34
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:46,621
An armed individual
is facing you.

35
00:05:47,835 --> 00:05:49,264
At this precise moment ...

36
00:05:49,537 --> 00:05:52,830
a cop who is not psychologically
prepared to use his weapon ...

37
00:05:53,173 --> 00:05:56,489
is a danger both to himself and to
those whom he should protect.

38
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:01,128
So ask yourselves these
questions:

39
00:06:01,915 --> 00:06:04,696
"Am I am prepared to risk
my life ?"...

40
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:07,975
"Am I prepared to kill?"

41
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:48,000
Good morning.

42
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,047
Lift the leg a little,
push the heel ...

43
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:59,270
- And lift the toes.
- I can't.

44
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:01,546
I'll help.

45
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:04,421
That 'hurts.

46
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,725
But you must try.
Or you'll never walk normally again.

47
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:14,365
Don't worry. I'm right here
- Mom.

48
00:07:15,489 --> 00:07:17,528
Do what the doctor says.

49
00:07:20,061 --> 00:07:21,718
So doctor, any progress?

50
00:07:22,496 --> 00:07:25,397
Not a doctor.
I'm just a nurse.

51
00:07:25,966 --> 00:07:30,057
I only care about the results.
And my mother is better.

52
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,008
Hi

53
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:58,640
How are you today?

54
00:07:58,899 --> 00:08:02,128
Ooh, your hand's cold!
Eaten anything yet?

55
00:08:02,469 --> 00:08:05,850
Go to the kitchen.
Yeva will prepare something.

56
00:08:06,206 --> 00:08:08,474
Fine, but stop smoking.

57
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:14,699
Anton!
Can you come here?

58
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:27,179
Here.
Your share for the car job.

59
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:33,995
That's all?

60
00:08:34,668 --> 00:08:37,220
Yeah, and stop with the cars.

61
00:08:38,305 --> 00:08:40,213
What will I do for
money?

62
00:08:40,507 --> 00:08:42,067
You are talking pocket-money.

63
00:08:43,076 --> 00:08:45,115
We have something better lined up.

64
00:08:45,412 --> 00:08:47,102
Tuesday, at 11 h.
Come with Rudy.

65
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,968
Your uncle will tell you where
to find us.

66
00:08:55,422 --> 00:08:57,494
What kind of job is it?

67
00:09:00,093 --> 00:09:01,981
What we do.
Don't worry.

68
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,868
Check the girl.

69
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:01,461
Who are you?

70
00:10:02,489 --> 00:10:04,277
I know him. I'm sorry. 

71
00:10:04,557 --> 00:10:06,215
- Okay.
- Just a minute.

72
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:09,874
- Why did you come here?
- Why don't you answer when I call?

73
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,815
Wait downstairs.
I'll be done in an hour.

74
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:33,889
Élodie, what's the problem?
It's been 2 days that I've tried to talk to you.

75
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:36,872
Sorry, but I've been very
busy. I'm exhausted.

76
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,361
Will this work stop.

77
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,914
- Really? And how am I supposed to live?
- I have money.

78
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:48,788
Gotta go.
I'll Be late.

79
00:11:01,582 --> 00:11:03,556
I know you don't see it ...

80
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:06,802
... but things will change.
Trust me.

81
00:11:07,153 --> 00:11:09,192
I'm not joking with you,
Élodie.

82
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:16,738
Come.

83
00:11:45,258 --> 00:11:46,916
- Anton, we're late!
- It'll take time.

84
00:11:47,193 --> 00:11:49,943
- Daniel called. They are waiting for us.
- Don't worry.

85
00:13:24,557 --> 00:13:25,702
Listen.

86
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:29,570
You'll open this safe, if you don't
want anything to happen to your family.

87
00:13:57,857 --> 00:13:59,799
Stop! Stop right there!

88
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:41,537
Where could he have gone?

89
00:14:44,069 --> 00:14:46,938
- You could have spared him ...
- Shut up!

90
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:18,145
The vehicles were found in
parking lot of a supermarket.

91
00:15:18,505 --> 00:15:20,031
Of course there are fingerprints.

92
00:15:20,306 --> 00:15:23,502
Who needs fingerprints?
We know who it was.

93
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:41,393
Pretty, isn't it?

94
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:43,465
It is.

95
00:16:44,389 --> 00:16:46,844
- You like it?
- Very much.

96
00:16:49,996 --> 00:16:51,883
Soon it will be ours.

97
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:54,225
What?

98
00:16:54,499 --> 00:16:57,760
We'll open a hotel,
just a few rooms.

99
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:05,985
Look over there. It will be for the horses.
I'll take care of them.

100
00:17:07,146 --> 00:17:10,145
- You mean horses?
- I will learn!

101
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:15,396
Come here.

102
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:18,076
Do not be afraid.

103
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:21,703
See.

104
00:17:25,565 --> 00:17:27,321
Give me your hand.

105
00:17:30,903 --> 00:17:34,099
Do not be afraid.
Open your palm.

106
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,130
Slowly, slowly ...

107
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:52,213
I want to live here.

108
00:17:55,294 --> 00:17:58,905
But only if you're with me.
Alone, I'm not interested.

109
00:18:52,885 --> 00:18:55,732
Come with us.
They're throwing a party.

110
00:18:56,055 --> 00:18:58,388
- You go on. I'll follow later.
- Come!

111
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:30,080
How are you?

112
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,964
Okay, how about you?

113
00:19:32,859 --> 00:19:35,062
I won't stay.
It's getting late.

114
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:38,622
I have not seen you lately,
but wanted to tell you one thing.

115
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,991
You're my son, Anton.

116
00:19:42,703 --> 00:19:46,018
One day, you know,
you'll take over the business.

117
00:19:48,774 --> 00:19:51,075
Your decisions may
be good or bad ...

118
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:54,813
... but never let anyone
question them.

119
00:19:55,816 --> 00:19:59,589
If they see you hesitate,
find that you are weak.

120
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:02,341
Then one of them will try
to take your place.

121
00:20:05,558 --> 00:20:09,933
What did you do that night
can't happen again.

122
00:20:10,796 --> 00:20:12,257
Never.

123
00:20:15,368 --> 00:20:17,156
Enjoy the evening.

124
00:20:33,386 --> 00:20:34,629
Anton!

125
00:20:35,221 --> 00:20:37,293
I was with your father.
Sit down.

126
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:38,964
I know.

127
00:20:42,429 --> 00:20:46,290
- What did you talk about?
- Everything and nothing. Business.

128
00:20:47,033 --> 00:20:49,301
Did you mention the ranch?

129
00:20:51,538 --> 00:20:55,017
What would you like me to tell you?
The property is not your father's thing .

130
00:20:57,643 --> 00:20:59,301
50 thousand.

131
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:03,642
With that I can set aside a
portion or two, not more.

132
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:06,404
I don't care.
This must remain 50-50.

133
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:10,874
- I don't want anyone else involved.
- Sure, but I need a little more.

134
00:21:16,262 --> 00:21:19,839
Get out! She is with me!
That goes for you too!

135
00:21:23,436 --> 00:21:25,574
Help me to prevent the sale.
I'll get the rest.

136
00:21:25,871 --> 00:21:28,553
Why mess with that place?
There are others.

137
00:21:28,874 --> 00:21:30,597
I want that one.

138
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,211
Okay.
To business!

139
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:38,343
Come on, to health!

140
00:21:40,553 --> 00:21:41,698
Stop.
Stop drinking!

141
00:21:41,954 --> 00:21:45,466
What is this? I'm fine!
You're being a pain!

142
00:21:45,825 --> 00:21:46,807
Sir, can't stay here.

143
00:21:47,059 --> 00:21:48,815
- Who are you?
- I'm the owner.

144
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:52,192
Get out. We're having fun.
I'm fine!

145
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:54,800
It's bothering the customers.
Learn to drink or stay home!

146
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,279
We finished drinking
so let's go.

147
00:21:56,536 --> 00:21:58,357
- No, leave now!
- Easy!

148
00:21:58,638 --> 00:22:00,710
- The club is mine!
- Fuck!

149
00:22:01,007 --> 00:22:03,211
Don't give us orders!

150
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:05,647
I do what I want here.
Know who we are?

151
00:22:05,946 --> 00:22:07,538
Of course I know.

152
00:22:07,813 --> 00:22:10,562
Some street slut's kids.

153
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:19,316
Leave! Go!
Go!

154
00:22:25,934 --> 00:22:28,548
Ready ... Let's start over.

155
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:33,897
Then, they were not celebrating
the robbery?

156
00:22:38,578 --> 00:22:41,643
We know you didn't hit
the owner of the club.

157
00:22:43,683 --> 00:22:45,406
Not hungry?

158
00:22:46,518 --> 00:22:48,493
You're a nice guy.

159
00:22:48,788 --> 00:22:51,243
Don't eat or drink, don't talk.

160
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:53,679
It's quiet.

161
00:22:53,959 --> 00:22:57,254
You won't bother anyone in prison.
The guards will worship you!

162
00:22:59,665 --> 00:23:02,446
Let's go to the next room.
It is quieter.

163
00:23:04,203 --> 00:23:06,439
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

164
00:23:46,011 --> 00:23:48,466
Nobody hit me.
I fell.

165
00:23:49,915 --> 00:23:51,769
A nightclub is dark.

166
00:23:52,452 --> 00:23:55,233
I tripped and hit
my head on a table.

167
00:23:55,554 --> 00:23:56,863
That's it.

168
00:23:57,923 --> 00:23:59,549
Are you kidding?

169
00:24:05,732 --> 00:24:09,408
Chief, we have a problem.
The guy is changing his statement

170
00:24:13,974 --> 00:24:15,861
Hey, what? What?

171
00:24:37,596 --> 00:24:40,084
What did you threaten to do?

172
00:24:41,033 --> 00:24:42,920
Kill his family?

173
00:24:44,036 --> 00:24:45,858
Burn his club down?

174
00:24:47,539 --> 00:24:50,834
You may have changed your region, Malakian,
but you haven't changed your methods.

175
00:24:51,443 --> 00:24:53,548
The Marigny mansion ... was you.

176
00:24:55,114 --> 00:24:57,187
A man was killed there.

177
00:24:57,483 --> 00:25:00,962
Wherever you go, there are deaths.
That's going to stop.

178
00:25:02,822 --> 00:25:04,709
Next time, you'll need
do more than intimidate...

179
00:25:04,991 --> 00:25:08,983
- A nightclub owner to get your way.
- And you are threatening me with what?

180
00:25:09,662 --> 00:25:13,142
October 16, 2003. I was
at the shopping centre during the shooting.

181
00:25:14,967 --> 00:25:17,170
I was only a lieutenant at the time.

182
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,499
You lost a son there.
I lost a friend.

183
00:25:22,741 --> 00:25:26,036
- It's all we have in common.
- Goodbye, sir.

184
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:43,509
- Where is Anton?
- I don't know.

185
00:25:45,931 --> 00:25:48,451
Where does he go when
he's not home?

186
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:51,491
I don't know, Milo.

187
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:55,080
Your son doesn't tell me everything.

188
00:25:55,708 --> 00:25:58,359
- Maybe with a girl.
- A girl?

189
00:26:00,613 --> 00:26:02,042
What girl?

190
00:26:04,316 --> 00:26:06,552
Anton knows several girls.

191
00:27:47,119 --> 00:27:49,257
This mass is dedicated ...

192
00:27:49,556 --> 00:27:54,061
to the memory of Georgy Malakian.
Georgy was a boy ...

193
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,402
who left us too soon ...

194
00:27:56,695 --> 00:27:59,662
cut down by violence
the world had chosen.

195
00:27:59,999 --> 00:28:05,267
May his soul rest in peace and the souls
of all those who loved him.

196
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,479
Okay?
You don't look good. </ I>

197
00:29:04,329 --> 00:29:06,402
No, I'm fine. </ i>

198
00:29:06,697 --> 00:29:09,152
Élodie, I feel that there's
something wrong. </ i>

199
00:29:09,468 --> 00:29:13,689
Is it your mysterious Armenian ?
Won't you tell me? </ I>

200
00:29:14,073 --> 00:29:17,717
- At least tell me what he does.
- I don't know. </ I>

201
00:29:18,477 --> 00:29:21,411
His name is also a secret? </ i>

202
00:29:24,682 --> 00:29:26,570
Anton.
His name is Anton. </ I>

203
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:28,661
Thank you.

204
00:30:09,761 --> 00:30:11,768
I'll stop by to pick you up at 18 h.

205
00:30:12,064 --> 00:30:14,332
Anton! Romeo!

206
00:30:18,203 --> 00:30:19,991
Check this.

207
00:30:22,908 --> 00:30:26,105
Remember poker at Zakar's house?
I took the shirt of his back.

208
00:30:26,445 --> 00:30:28,812
He said that he was bankrupt
then emptied his shop.

209
00:30:29,114 --> 00:30:30,358
Here.

210
00:30:30,617 --> 00:30:33,235
- It's Italian. The best.
- I can't wear this.

211
00:30:35,154 --> 00:30:37,641
It's kid. Kid!
Look!

212
00:30:37,956 --> 00:30:41,055
- I have one. They're the best!
- We can't go out with the same shoes.

213
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:43,814
Then choose another.

214
00:30:47,432 --> 00:30:48,577
Rudy ...

215
00:30:48,967 --> 00:30:50,854
need to talk to you.

216
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:53,023
About an old project.

217
00:30:54,372 --> 00:30:57,885
- What kind?
- A hotel in Camargue.

218
00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:01,438
A legal business.

219
00:31:02,981 --> 00:31:05,468
It's in progress.
Want to invest?

220
00:31:06,286 --> 00:31:08,619
- Milo knows?
- No.

221
00:31:10,489 --> 00:31:11,699
Wait, Anton.

222
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:16,080
Why do you want to work?
The job at the mansion went well.

223
00:31:17,796 --> 00:31:22,465
We can't do things without your
father knowledge. You know how it works.

224
00:31:22,868 --> 00:31:24,330
I know.

225
00:31:24,603 --> 00:31:26,840
How much do you need?

226
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:30,779
30 thousand ... 40 thousand?

227
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:56,586
BAKERY - CONFECTIONERY

228
00:32:01,173 --> 00:32:02,100
See.

229
00:32:02,341 --> 00:32:04,250
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

230
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:06,648
- What do you want?
- This.

231
00:32:07,714 --> 00:32:09,142
Okay.

232
00:32:09,514 --> 00:32:12,547
- Let's hold hands.
- I did not.

233
00:32:12,885 --> 00:32:14,673
- This.
- Come on.

234
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:38,536
Bollocks!

235
00:32:48,353 --> 00:32:51,352
Take care!
Those plants have thorns!

236
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:33,124
Ruben, come on.

237
00:33:46,378 --> 00:33:48,450
Anton, how are you?

238
00:33:48,815 --> 00:33:50,091
Wait!
What's this?

239
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,349
In order be ready next summer,
we must start now.

240
00:33:53,885 --> 00:33:56,273
What is this?
We had a deal!

241
00:33:56,688 --> 00:33:59,372
You talk about money,
but I only get promises.

242
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:01,651
I need to see the colour of it.

243
00:34:02,861 --> 00:34:06,636
For now, I'm paying on
account, but it'll not go far.

244
00:34:06,998 --> 00:34:09,102
There are people with much money
willing to invest.

245
00:34:09,401 --> 00:34:11,222
I'll get the money.
Don't you trust me?

246
00:34:11,503 --> 00:34:12,910
When?

247
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,330
Give me a month.

248
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:20,724
- Why not do it with ...
- My father?

249
00:34:21,046 --> 00:34:23,379
No chance.
Let him out of it.

250
00:34:24,649 --> 00:34:25,991
A month.

251
00:34:27,084 --> 00:34:29,834
Okay.
Not a day more.

252
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:43,655
It's always the same thing.

253
00:34:44,970 --> 00:34:47,653
They want results,
but we take our men.

254
00:34:50,208 --> 00:34:53,055
The ministry wants to put an
end to slot machines.

255
00:34:53,378 --> 00:34:57,785
As of today, this is the priority.
Put your men onto it.

256
00:34:58,183 --> 00:35:00,255
- And Malakian?
- Forget him for now.

257
00:35:00,552 --> 00:35:05,253
Why? It's been a problem,
and we've been making good progress.

258
00:35:06,591 --> 00:35:08,151
Progress?

259
00:35:09,194 --> 00:35:11,975
You haven't brought any evidence
before the judge ...

260
00:35:12,297 --> 00:35:16,225
- We can!
- There's been nothing concrete in this matter!

261
00:35:17,068 --> 00:35:18,856
Use informants.
Work.

262
00:35:19,137 --> 00:35:24,155
We won't get anywhere doing that.
Nobody dares to rat on Malakian.

263
00:35:26,745 --> 00:35:31,184
I'm confused, Saunier.
In Paris, you had good grades.

264
00:35:31,983 --> 00:35:35,910
What are you doing here?
I know your record.

265
00:35:37,956 --> 00:35:40,923
Don' make Malakian
a personal matter.

266
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,074
There is nothing worse for a cop
than a lack of objectivity.

267
00:35:44,396 --> 00:35:46,697
- They committed murder.
- I know.

268
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:51,116
I know.

269
00:36:41,854 --> 00:36:43,031
Did you have a good trip?

270
00:36:43,588 --> 00:36:45,562
We took it easy

271
00:36:46,525 --> 00:36:49,459
- Okay, Milo?
- Well, Frank, fine.

272
00:36:58,035 --> 00:37:01,865
Every year, with casinos,
hotels, shops ...

273
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,022
lots of money changes
hands on the Riviera.

274
00:37:05,343 --> 00:37:08,987
During the loading and
transport, safety is priority.

275
00:37:09,347 --> 00:37:11,387
Bvt wh3n th3 m0n3y
1s 1ns1de the plane ...

276
00:37:11,683 --> 00:37:14,650
... mission complete:
the cops go away.

277
00:37:14,986 --> 00:37:18,630
Therefore, during the minutes between
loading and takeoff ...

278
00:37:19,658 --> 00:37:23,967
... the aircraft is unattended.
That's where we come in.

279
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:27,518
How many men does it take?

280
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,554
Ten at the most.

281
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:35,803
You want to know your
share, right?

282
00:37:37,309 --> 00:37:39,413
Well, doesn't everyone?

283
00:37:42,615 --> 00:37:44,305
5 million.

284
00:37:44,583 --> 00:37:46,623
For each one of you.

285
00:37:47,052 --> 00:37:48,459
Minimum.

286
00:37:50,422 --> 00:37:51,731
Interested, Anton?

287
00:37:55,794 --> 00:37:57,103
Frank?

288
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:03,031
It's tempting, Milo, but risky.
We need to know a little more.

289
00:38:06,104 --> 00:38:07,664
I'll show you.

290
00:38:14,246 --> 00:38:16,033
The entrance to the airport is here.

291
00:38:16,314 --> 00:38:19,543
The traansport arrives here.
The plane is parked here.

292
00:38:20,652 --> 00:38:23,499
Once the passengers have boarded,
they remove the ladder.

293
00:38:54,552 --> 00:38:55,763
Rudy ...

294
00:38:58,089 --> 00:39:00,577
How long has he been
with this girl?

295
00:39:01,126 --> 00:39:02,555
What girl?

296
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:08,152
I'm not stupid. The nurse.
How long you been with her?

297
00:39:09,234 --> 00:39:13,128
- I don't know, Milo.
- Since she started coming here?

298
00:39:16,676 --> 00:39:18,082
I do not know.

299
00:39:30,455 --> 00:39:33,324
We want to bring
a bit of money.

300
00:39:33,659 --> 00:39:34,836
Sure.

301
00:39:35,794 --> 00:39:38,663
- How much?
- Between 600 and 800 thousand.

302
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,827
I need to organize.

303
00:39:43,968 --> 00:39:49,368
It's more than usual.
Thus your percentage drops to 7.

304
00:39:50,408 --> 00:39:53,791
You know I get 12 because
the operation is risky.

305
00:39:55,245 --> 00:40:00,363
- That's expensive money.
- But the money is clean. I guarantee it.

306
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:15,406
Okay, good.

307
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,289
Anton ... will he participate?

308
00:40:27,078 --> 00:40:29,729
- Why ask?
- Nothing much.

309
00:40:30,782 --> 00:40:32,211
Yes
Tell me.

310
00:40:34,886 --> 00:40:37,733
We have a small business together.

311
00:40:38,456 --> 00:40:40,146
A business?

312
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:42,803
Yes.

313
00:40:43,662 --> 00:40:45,995
What type of business?

314
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:50,604
It's nothing.

315
00:40:50,902 --> 00:40:54,349
I like Anton.
He is your son.

316
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:24,186
- Ms. Leconte?
- Yes Why?

317
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:26,296
Inspector Saunier.

318
00:41:30,074 --> 00:41:33,423
I chose to come here
instead of summoning you.

319
00:41:34,479 --> 00:41:37,195
I wanted to talk to you.
May I come in?

320
00:41:45,523 --> 00:41:48,272
Here.
It's for you.

321
00:41:49,326 --> 00:41:51,847
- What is it?
- Open.

322
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:09,643
What should I do? Choose one?
Is it a gift from the police?

323
00:42:10,248 --> 00:42:13,063
I didn't come here to meddle
in your private life.

324
00:42:14,052 --> 00:42:16,157
I'm in an investigation ...

325
00:42:16,454 --> 00:42:19,749
and my duty is to inform you of the
Malakian family activities.

326
00:42:21,226 --> 00:42:23,135
Malakian clan.

327
00:42:34,305 --> 00:42:35,831
Who is that?

328
00:42:37,308 --> 00:42:40,406
The doorman of a mansion
that was robbed a few days ago.

329
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:45,621
- What do I have to do with it?
- Nothing, directly.

330
00:42:46,117 --> 00:42:48,800
But Anton Malakian participated with
those who robbed the mansion ...

331
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,389
and the murder of this man.

332
00:42:53,224 --> 00:42:56,387
- He would never do that.
- Maybe.

333
00:42:57,096 --> 00:43:01,884
But it is a dead end.
Sooner or later he will come to an end.

334
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,234
To find what?
Prison?

335
00:43:07,605 --> 00:43:11,052
Or probably the same as
happened to his brother.

336
00:43:13,379 --> 00:43:15,451
I need your help, miss.

337
00:43:17,448 --> 00:43:22,531
We can still avoid it.
But only you can help.

338
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:35,612
Here.
This is my card.

339
00:43:37,802 --> 00:43:40,354
If you know something,
call me.

340
00:43:54,085 --> 00:43:56,189
What can I do for you, Milo?

341
00:43:56,921 --> 00:43:59,790
- I need equipment.
- I'm listening.

342
00:44:00,325 --> 00:44:02,114
A team of 10 men.

343
00:44:02,928 --> 00:44:05,610
Rifles, flak jackets
bullets and grenades.

344
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:08,449
And also an ML 83.

345
00:44:10,101 --> 00:44:12,467
What will you do with all this?

346
00:44:13,871 --> 00:44:17,001
Abdeslam Halami,
71 years, retired.

347
00:44:17,342 --> 00:44:20,854
He left France 10 years ago and returned
to Lebanon, his homeland.

348
00:44:21,713 --> 00:44:25,160
We know that he has
continued his arms business there.

349
00:44:25,516 --> 00:44:28,864
His cover for his importing and exporting
for the Mediterranean region.

350
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:33,889
Mainly dates and exotic fruits.
He's been only interrogated once.

351
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:37,187
So what?

352
00:44:37,429 --> 00:44:40,940
He convinced the judge that the Syrians established
the company to bring French arms ...

353
00:44:41,299 --> 00:44:44,049
... to Beirut.

354
00:44:44,902 --> 00:44:46,363
Okay.

355
00:44:47,905 --> 00:44:50,392
Those photos of that meeting
Malakian and ...

356
00:44:50,709 --> 00:44:52,748
Identified all of the faces?

357
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:57,772
It's kind of complicated.
Some I don't recognise.

358
00:44:59,517 --> 00:45:02,070
In any case,
is certain that somebody is arming him.

359
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:11,335
This guy ...

360
00:45:11,762 --> 00:45:15,177
- We want him to be watched.
- Okay, but how?

361
00:45:16,568 --> 00:45:18,476
Now we are only two.

362
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,000
So?

363
00:45:57,542 --> 00:45:58,753
Seven minutes.

364
00:45:59,644 --> 00:46:01,553
If we take the road,
as planned ...

365
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:06,384
they can set up a roadblock. If
we use boats, they can't stop us.

366
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:09,640
We found the creek
where we'll start ...

367
00:46:09,954 --> 00:46:13,466
two cars that wait for us and then
head north in two cars.

368
00:46:13,826 --> 00:46:17,142
In 7 minutes,
will be 50 km ahead of the cops.

369
00:46:21,933 --> 00:46:23,722
Your idea is good, son.

370
00:46:28,039 --> 00:46:32,577
It will be a nice coup, and us
together. You have what it takes.

371
00:46:34,178 --> 00:46:36,665
Men will listen to you.

372
00:46:41,586 --> 00:46:42,796
Anton ...

373
00:46:44,422 --> 00:46:46,789
What's between you and this girl?

374
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,082
The nurse?

375
00:46:51,497 --> 00:46:55,358
I know that you've been seeing her
for a while now. What does she know about us?

376
00:46:57,135 --> 00:47:01,575
Nothing. Think I chatter like
woman? Talk in my sleep?

377
00:47:03,274 --> 00:47:08,226
Pay attention. With that girl around our
necks, we can't afford mistakes.

378
00:47:09,947 --> 00:47:12,980
We are a family.
She's different.

379
00:47:14,018 --> 00:47:15,806
She can not understand us.

380
00:47:16,087 --> 00:47:17,363
On the contrary ...

381
00:47:18,156 --> 00:47:20,011
... she can betray us.

382
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,033
This girl ...

383
00:47:27,732 --> 00:47:29,619
you have to finish with her.

384
00:47:32,537 --> 00:47:33,966
Do you understand?

385
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,901
Yes, I understand.

386
00:47:40,812 --> 00:47:42,567
Let's go.

387
00:48:00,898 --> 00:48:02,142
Ready.

388
00:48:46,677 --> 00:48:47,604
Good.

389
00:49:00,524 --> 00:49:02,662
I'll send Coutard
to replace you.

390
00:49:24,815 --> 00:49:25,927
Mirelli, you hear me? </ i>

391
00:49:26,184 --> 00:49:28,288
- I'm listening.
- My way. </ I>

392
00:49:31,822 --> 00:49:33,677
What is he doing?

393
00:50:09,193 --> 00:50:10,949
Who is this, Milo?

394
00:50:12,263 --> 00:50:13,691
A cop.

395
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:16,607
A cop bastard.

396
00:51:04,983 --> 00:51:07,502
Get out, Mirella!
Get out!

397
00:51:48,659 --> 00:51:51,528
Okay, Saunier.
You're back on the case.

398
00:52:24,995 --> 00:52:27,133
He was here last night?

399
00:52:30,101 --> 00:52:31,344
Stop, Miss.

400
00:52:33,902 --> 00:52:35,621
The road is closed. </ i>

401
00:52:43,380 --> 00:52:44,590
Walk!

402
00:53:04,568 --> 00:53:06,934
There is no reason
to quit.

403
00:53:07,271 --> 00:53:09,790
They can't know
what we are preparing.

404
00:53:11,242 --> 00:53:13,478
The next transfer
is in 3 weeks.

405
00:53:13,777 --> 00:53:16,973
We have to stay hidden.
It is difficult for all of us ...

406
00:53:17,314 --> 00:53:18,776
for our families ...

407
00:53:19,417 --> 00:53:21,652
... but do not forget
who you are.

408
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:25,238
And we're all here
meeting.

409
00:53:25,756 --> 00:53:27,860
We are of the same family ...

410
00:53:28,392 --> 00:53:30,083
... we share the same roots.

411
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:43,380
What about the boats?

412
00:53:45,109 --> 00:53:47,051
It's all right.

413
00:54:03,527 --> 00:54:06,493
Meanwhile, be discreet.
No more confusion.

414
00:54:07,131 --> 00:54:09,978
Our families are safe.
We'll..

415
00:54:10,902 --> 00:54:12,810
... hole-up here, until it's time.

416
00:54:56,713 --> 00:54:58,208
It's me.

417
00:54:58,849 --> 00:55:00,409
Climb on.

418
00:55:06,256 --> 00:55:08,165
I don't want this life.

419
00:55:09,426 --> 00:55:12,273
You're gone without saying anything,
aren't you talking to me?

420
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:19,254
You don't say anything about your your family, hear.

421
00:55:22,806 --> 00:55:24,115
Is your brother died, then?

422
00:55:26,377 --> 00:55:28,264
Who told you that?

423
00:55:29,314 --> 00:55:31,004
Was it Rudy?

424
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:35,138
Tell me, who told you that?

425
00:55:35,986 --> 00:55:40,774
Cops. They came to my house
to tell me of your life.

426
00:55:45,262 --> 00:55:46,855
I'm pregnant.

427
00:56:00,843 --> 00:56:04,072
See you Tuesday at
my office, right?

428
00:56:04,448 --> 00:56:06,684
I'll be waiting.
Goodbye.

429
00:56:09,354 --> 00:56:11,208
Do not make that face.

430
00:56:14,191 --> 00:56:17,801
We had an agreement,
but I couldn't wait.

431
00:56:18,162 --> 00:56:21,064
I'll have the money here,
it a question of a few days!

432
00:56:21,398 --> 00:56:23,569
Anton, we are friends.

433
00:56:23,868 --> 00:56:26,550
Maybe it was the business
right for you.

434
00:56:28,205 --> 00:56:31,304
You did not trust me.
I gave you my word!

435
00:56:32,910 --> 00:56:34,339
I'm sorry.

436
00:56:36,448 --> 00:56:38,487
Who did you sign up?

437
00:56:39,550 --> 00:56:41,273
It's confidential.
It's business.

438
00:56:49,626 --> 00:56:51,000
Sorry.

439
00:57:07,545 --> 00:57:11,318
Tell me, come on! Tell me!
Tell me that you made a deal with my father!

440
00:57:11,682 --> 00:57:16,503
The deal was between me and you!
Nobody else! Nobody!

441
00:57:29,634 --> 00:57:30,810
What is wrong with you? </ i>

442
00:57:31,068 --> 00:57:35,223
The deal is still in the family.
I or you, what difference does it make?

443
00:57:36,306 --> 00:57:39,818
- Everything.
- If you miss a beat...</ i>

444
00:57:40,177 --> 00:57:42,827
... lose the proximity,
it creates danger.

445
00:57:43,347 --> 00:57:46,609
You talk of cool?
The cop on the quay, the shooting ...

446
00:57:46,985 --> 00:57:48,610
... what was that about? </ i>

447
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,859
He participated in the murder
of your brother.

448
00:57:52,289 --> 00:57:54,906
And what you did, will it bring him
back to life?

449
00:57:56,026 --> 00:57:59,855
You don't understand.
The problem is this girl.

450
00:58:07,972 --> 00:58:12,226
Pay attention.
For me, it's all over.

451
00:58:14,878 --> 00:58:16,852
I'll leave you with your ghosts.

452
00:58:43,774 --> 00:58:45,780
Let's take that too.

453
00:59:16,006 --> 00:59:18,340
Bordighera, Italy

454
00:59:18,642 --> 00:59:19,984
Have a nice day, miss. </ i>

455
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:22,352
Thank you.
Goodbye.

456
00:59:38,595 --> 00:59:40,417
Hi, beautiful!

457
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:42,290
Hi, Rudy!

458
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,228
It's beautiful here.

459
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:54,363
With the old folk.

460
00:59:54,645 --> 00:59:56,303
Being bored.

461
00:59:58,715 --> 01:00:00,918
Paid to you as soon as possible.

462
01:00:02,986 --> 01:00:05,474
That is why we should
get back to work.

463
01:00:06,758 --> 01:00:08,644
It's for next week.

464
01:00:11,162 --> 01:00:13,528
- Everything is ready.
- Enough, Rudy!

465
01:00:15,933 --> 01:00:18,900
You are being cruel.
Think about it ...

466
01:00:20,404 --> 01:00:22,476
... his father has lost a son.

467
01:00:23,473 --> 01:00:26,342
- You can't do that to him.
- Stay out of it.

468
01:00:30,682 --> 01:00:32,590
He is suffering.

469
01:00:32,883 --> 01:00:34,825
I hate to see it that way.

470
01:00:48,264 --> 01:00:49,442
Good morning, Milo.

471
01:00:50,834 --> 01:00:52,427
Sit down, Rudy.

472
01:01:07,051 --> 01:01:08,643
He won't return, Milo.

473
01:01:10,486 --> 01:01:13,104
I won'tt ask where he is.

474
01:01:16,393 --> 01:01:18,303
I swore to Anton.

475
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:24,585
I know you keep your word.
Because you only have one word.

476
01:01:25,635 --> 01:01:27,708
Because you are strong.

477
01:01:29,639 --> 01:01:31,810
That's why you work
for me, right?

478
01:01:32,709 --> 01:01:34,017
Yes

479
01:01:37,247 --> 01:01:38,654
This girl ...

480
01:01:40,851 --> 01:01:42,640
... she needs to disappear.

481
01:01:46,056 --> 01:01:47,779
Milo, you know ...

482
01:01:49,926 --> 01:01:51,616
Anton is my friend.

483
01:01:56,367 --> 01:01:58,188
I can't do that.

484
01:02:00,970 --> 01:02:04,582
Then ... what
can you do for me?

485
01:02:36,274 --> 01:02:39,087
Why don't you think of
other possibilities.

486
01:02:39,743 --> 01:02:42,874
Here are all the transports
for next month.

487
01:02:43,213 --> 01:02:45,155
Both regular and irregular.

488
01:02:47,685 --> 01:02:50,717
- Something from the wiretap?
- Nothing yet.

489
01:02:51,955 --> 01:02:53,264
Good ..

490
01:02:59,596 --> 01:03:04,832
Check the values of transports
for banks, list them by size.

491
01:03:14,344 --> 01:03:16,710
- Did you see Rudy today?
- No.

492
01:03:17,013 --> 01:03:19,379
His car just passed.

493
01:03:20,050 --> 01:03:21,610
Really?

494
01:03:26,323 --> 01:03:28,526
I'm going to the pharmacy.
Do you need anything?

495
01:03:29,259 --> 01:03:30,884
Pharmacy?

496
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,437
I'm fine.

497
01:03:33,697 --> 01:03:35,191
It's okay.

498
01:03:36,000 --> 01:03:37,493
Terrific.

499
01:03:40,804 --> 01:03:42,211
Later.

500
01:06:24,701 --> 01:06:26,195
Rudy!

501
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:35,124
No!

502
01:08:21,117 --> 01:08:22,808
You don't understand.

503
01:08:24,154 --> 01:08:26,390
I'll never be what you want.

504
01:08:26,689 --> 01:08:27,899
Never!

505
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:31,508
Let us be united for what
has to be done.

506
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:34,250
And then you leave me alone.

507
01:08:35,699 --> 01:08:38,065
Or break with me now.

508
01:08:45,275 --> 01:08:47,250
What you'll gain today ...

509
01:08:48,445 --> 01:08:50,549
... will last forever.

510
01:08:51,714 --> 01:08:54,713
Then you can do whatever you want.

511
01:09:45,101 --> 01:09:47,272
They're behind us, 20 m away.

512
01:09:49,639 --> 01:09:51,330
What a geek!

513
01:10:48,264 --> 01:10:50,783
Boarding has begun.

514
01:11:06,883 --> 01:11:08,857
They have just arrived.

515
01:11:26,736 --> 01:11:28,143
Loading now.

516
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:45,477
Good morning, gentlemen!

517
01:11:45,755 --> 01:11:49,366
I am responsible for security.
Can I take them to the control tower.

518
01:11:49,727 --> 01:11:52,060
- Come on.
- Follow me.

519
01:12:02,539 --> 01:12:03,465
Saunier is here.

520
01:12:04,273 --> 01:12:05,702
at the terminal. </ i>

521
01:12:11,248 --> 01:12:13,287
What do we do? </ i>

522
01:12:13,583 --> 01:12:15,044
Let's continue.

523
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:33,547
"NOW"

524
01:12:50,154 --> 01:12:53,054
Hello?
I need a taxi, please.

525
01:12:58,395 --> 01:13:00,052
These cameras cover
area outside?

526
01:13:00,329 --> 01:13:02,118
Yes.
We are beside the sea.

527
01:13:02,398 --> 01:13:04,469
We look for birds before
each takeoff.

528
01:13:13,509 --> 01:13:14,938
They are leaving.

529
01:13:20,983 --> 01:13:22,477
Start the car. </ i>

530
01:13:30,326 --> 01:13:32,213
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

531
01:13:34,964 --> 01:13:37,517
The plane is starting to taxi ...

532
01:13:46,142 --> 01:13:47,996
- Where are they?
- Who?

533
01:13:48,277 --> 01:13:50,220
Officers!
Where are they?

534
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:53,229
They leave the runway for takeoff.
It's safer.

535
01:13:53,549 --> 01:13:55,175
Give me the walkie-talkie.

536
01:13:55,452 --> 01:13:57,076
It Saunier.
Back immediately.

537
01:13:57,352 --> 01:13:58,781
Our part is over. </ i>

538
01:13:59,056 --> 01:14:02,830
Back now. Do not leave until
the plane has taken off! Is that clear?

539
01:14:41,398 --> 01:14:43,284
The cops! Officers!

540
01:14:43,833 --> 01:14:45,656
They returned  </ i>

541
01:14:45,936 --> 01:14:47,396
Prepare.

542
01:15:44,327 --> 01:15:46,083
Lock us down!

543
01:16:50,059 --> 01:16:50,987
Fast!

544
01:17:04,307 --> 01:17:05,900
Smoke!

545
01:17:06,275 --> 01:17:07,867
Fast!

546
01:17:15,117 --> 01:17:16,710
Mischa!

547
01:17:16,986 --> 01:17:19,571
Call someone.
Do passengers get out.

548
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:40,462
Spread the men out!

549
01:18:02,932 --> 01:18:05,484
Don't shoot!
Passengers on the runway!

550
01:18:07,903 --> 01:18:10,042
Stand up, lady.
Protect yourself.

551
01:18:10,339 --> 01:18:14,299
No one shoots until I tell you!
Get everyone here!

552
01:18:18,714 --> 01:18:22,096
Coutard! Call someone!
Block their exit!

553
01:18:22,585 --> 01:18:24,374
Charly, come with me!

554
01:18:27,024 --> 01:18:28,485
Cover me!

555
01:19:11,534 --> 01:19:12,908
Don't stand there!

556
01:19:17,974 --> 01:19:21,519
Go to the car!
Do what I say!

557
01:19:26,849 --> 01:19:28,344
Anton ...

558
01:20:57,039 --> 01:20:59,428
Fast!
Help him!

559
01:21:01,610 --> 01:21:03,365
Hurry!

560
01:21:04,313 --> 01:21:05,839
Fast!

561
01:21:12,989 --> 01:21:14,232
Come!

562
01:21:38,381 --> 01:21:40,136
Climb on!
Come!

563
01:21:41,850 --> 01:21:43,377
Come!

564
01:22:38,942 --> 01:22:40,698
Hold on, Anton.

565
01:22:41,344 --> 01:22:44,093
Hear me?
Hold on.

566
01:22:46,414 --> 01:22:50,059
Élodie ...
she's waiting for me on the beach ...

567
01:22:59,527 --> 01:23:02,015
Lead Me, Father ...

568
01:23:29,426 --> 01:23:30,767
Anton ...

569
01:25:33,182 --> 01:25:34,937
Good morning, miss. </ i>

570
01:25:36,251 --> 01:25:38,324
You have a visitor. </ i>

571
01:25:38,621 --> 01:25:40,147
Your father . </ i>

572
01:25:42,124 --> 01:25:43,586
My father?
