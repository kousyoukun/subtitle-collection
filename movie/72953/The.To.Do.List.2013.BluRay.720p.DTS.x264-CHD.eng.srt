It's orientation.
She's a newbie. Cut her some slack.

Oh, honestly.
Thank you.

Way to go, dumb-ass.
Shut the front door, Amber.

I'm talking about Brandy.

339
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,131
She's clearly curious about sex.
I think I should talk to her.

340
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:37,170
No. No talk.
Your talks do more harm than good.

341
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,291
What's that supposed to mean?

342
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,489
It means, you had a talk with Amber
and look how that turned out.

343
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,842
You put her on the pill
when she was 15

344
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,288
and she's been dating,
pardon my French, jerks ever since.

345
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,724
And now she's gonna marry one.

348
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,965
Let's see.
I lost my virginity when I was 15.

349
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,731
Fifteen?
No, actually 14, with Francois.

350
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,567
Our exchange student?
But he was so rude.

351
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:17,851
He always played his stereo too loud.
He never let me in his roo... Touche.

352
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,766
He had a big dick. Yeah, Francois,
you know, sex wasn't that bad

353
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,922
but it didn't get good
until sophomore year.

354
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,163
College, okay, that makes sense.
You're more mature...

355
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,769
High school. By then, the guys had cars.
We would park at Beaver Creek.

356
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,890
Do people still do that,
go to Beaver Creek to fuck?

357
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,766
How would I know?
Oh, shit, right. Virgin. Ha, ha.

358
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:42,288
Man, it feels good to finally be smarter
at something than my kid sister.

359
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,606

that cherry before you get to college.

360
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,125

Hi there. Cameron.

It's been a while.
I know.

1737

You never returned my electronic mail.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

I just...
I think I needed some time.

1739
01:38:17,640 --> 01:38:23,044
I understand. And I'm sorry too.
That night was really crazy.

1740
01:38:23,880 --> 01:38:26,645
But I'm glad
that we, like, never had sex.

I know what you mean.

1744
01:38:32,440 --> 01:38:34,329
You do?
Yes.

1745
01:38:34,480 --> 01:38:39,691

Mm-hm. I did it. I had sex.

1746

Wow.

1747
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:44,324
My roommate and I went out,
a drunk senior came up to me and said:

1748
01:38:44,520 --> 01:38:46,170
"You a freshman?"
I was like, "Yeah."

1749
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:48,561
Next thing you know,
I'm losing it on the bathroom floor.

Whoa. She just up and took it.
She just up and took it. Heh.

01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,531
Yeah, but all that to say,
I just want you to know

01:38:55,680 --> 01:38:57,921
that I know what you meant
that night.

1753

That sex is a big deal,
but it's also not a big deal.

1754
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:04,322
Don't get me wrong, it's a big deal,
but it doesn't have to be such a big deal.

1755
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:06,369
No, it doesn't.

1756
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:09,490
I guess what I mean is,
sometimes sex is just sex.

1757
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:12,650
Yeah, sometimes sex is just sex.
