1
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,333
So you want me to tell
you the story of my life.

2
00:03:08,569 --> 00:03:11,902
Like I said, that's what I do.
I interview people.

3
00:03:12,073 --> 00:03:13,563
I'm a collector of lives.

4
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:15,504
FM radio, KFRC.

5
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:18,167
You'll need a lot of tape for my story.

6
00:03:18,346 --> 00:03:20,906
No problem. I got a bag full of tape.

7
00:03:22,183 --> 00:03:24,344
You followed me here, didn't you?

8
00:03:24,919 --> 00:03:26,853
Yeah, I suppose I did.

9
00:03:27,355 --> 00:03:29,255
You seemed very interesting.

10
00:03:30,424 --> 00:03:32,187
This is where you live?

11
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:33,582
No.

12
00:03:33,761 --> 00:03:35,353
It's just a room.

13
00:03:37,932 --> 00:03:40,196
What do you say we get started?

14
00:03:43,204 --> 00:03:44,694
What do you do?

15
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:46,430
I'm a vampire.

16
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,544
I haven't heard that before.

17
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:54,278
You mean this literally, I take it?

18
00:03:54,448 --> 00:03:55,881
Absolutely.

19
00:03:56,717 --> 00:03:59,049
I was waiting for you in that alley.

20
00:03:59,287 --> 00:04:01,448
Watching you watching me.

21
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,290
And then you began to speak.

22
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:07,454
What a lucky break for me.

23
00:04:07,628 --> 00:04:09,562
Perhaps lucky for both of us.

24
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,628
You said you were...

25
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:17,464
...waiting for me.

26
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:21,136
What were you going to do?
Kill me, drink my blood?

27
00:04:21,309 --> 00:04:22,401
Yes.

28
00:04:23,411 --> 00:04:25,470
But you needn't be concerned now.

29
00:04:27,982 --> 00:04:31,076
You really believe this, don't
you, that you're a vampire?

30
00:04:32,086 --> 00:04:33,986
We can't begin this way.

31
00:04:34,155 --> 00:04:35,747
Let me turn on the light.

32
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:39,990
- I thought vampires didn't like light.
- We love it.

33
00:04:41,329 --> 00:04:43,593
I only wanted to prepare you.

34
00:04:45,933 --> 00:04:46,831
Christ!

35
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,764
Don't be frightened.

36
00:04:49,437 --> 00:04:51,428
I want this opportunity.

37
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:53,501
How the hell'd you do that?

38
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:55,332
The same as you do.

39
00:04:55,943 --> 00:04:58,343
A series of simple gestures.

40
00:04:58,512 --> 00:05:00,946
Only I moved too fast for you to see.

41
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:03,841
I'm flesh and blood...

42
00:05:04,018 --> 00:05:05,610
...but not human.

43
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,283
I haven't been human for 200 years.

44
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,285
Please...

45
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:22,792
How can I put you at ease?

46
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:25,798
Shall we begin like "David Copperfield?"

47
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:27,031
"I am born...

48
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,368
...I grew up."

49
00:05:30,378 --> 00:05:34,712
Or shall we begin when I was
born to darkness, as I call it.

50
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:38,981
That's where we should
start, don't you think?

51
00:05:41,055 --> 00:05:43,046
You're not lying, are you?

52
00:05:44,158 --> 00:05:45,819
Why should I lie?

53
00:05:47,828 --> 00:05:50,661
1791 was the year it happened.

54
00:05:55,236 --> 00:05:56,999
I was 24.

55
00:05:57,171 --> 00:05:59,230
Younger than you are now.

56
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:03,005
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.

57
00:06:03,177 --> 00:06:07,238
The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.

58
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:13,009
I had lost my wife in childbirth.

59
00:06:13,187 --> 00:06:16,418
She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.

60
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:19,755
I would've been happy to join them.

61
00:06:22,196 --> 00:06:24,756
I couldn't bear the pain of their loss.

62
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,533
I longed to be released from it.

63
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:42,272
I wanted to lose it all:

64
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:43,940
My wealth...

65
00:06:44,618 --> 00:06:46,108
...my estate...

66
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,212
...my sanity.

67
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:58,227
How many aces are in a deck?

68
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:00,391
Are you calling me a cheat?

69
00:07:03,637 --> 00:07:06,572
No, I'm calling you a
piece of stinking offal!

70
00:07:12,246 --> 00:07:15,079
You lack the courage of your conviction.
Do it!

71
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,583
Most of all, I longed for death.

72
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,477
I know that now.

73
00:07:21,155 --> 00:07:22,816
I invited it.

74
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:26,318
A release from the pain of living.

75
00:07:47,615 --> 00:07:50,277
My invitation was open to anyone.

76
00:07:51,018 --> 00:07:53,179
To the whore at my side.

77
00:07:54,188 --> 00:07:56,349
To the pimp that followed.

78
00:07:58,526 --> 00:08:01,518
But it was a vampire that accepted.

79
00:08:27,888 --> 00:08:29,719
Give me your money or you die!

80
00:09:04,592 --> 00:09:06,423
Do you still want death?

81
00:09:06,694 --> 00:09:08,753
Or have you tasted enough?

82
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:10,089
Enough.

83
00:09:19,707 --> 00:09:22,870
He left me there, on the
banks of the Mississippi...

84
00:09:23,944 --> 00:09:27,038
...somewhere between life and death.

85
00:09:45,466 --> 00:09:48,128
Who are you? What're
you doing at my house?

86
00:09:49,036 --> 00:09:51,698
I've come to answer your prayers.

87
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,473
Life has no meaning anymore...

88
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,807
...does it?

89
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,708
The wine has no taste.

90
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:04,874
The food sickens you.

91
00:10:05,052 --> 00:10:08,044
There seems no reason for any of it...

92
00:10:08,222 --> 00:10:09,484
...does there?

93
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,494
What if I could give it back to you?

94
00:10:15,829 --> 00:10:17,319
Pluck out the pain...

95
00:10:17,498 --> 00:10:19,557
...and give you another life?

96
00:10:20,167 --> 00:10:22,499
One you could never imagine.

97
00:10:23,671 --> 00:10:25,161
And it would be...

98
00:10:25,339 --> 00:10:27,170
...for all time.

99
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,406
And sickness...

100
00:10:29,576 --> 00:10:31,066
...and death...

101
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:33,577
...could never touch you again.

102
00:10:35,249 --> 00:10:36,739
Don't be afraid.

103
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:40,009
I'm going to give you the choice...

104
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:41,176
...l...

105
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:43,012
...never had.

106
00:10:52,433 --> 00:10:55,027
That morning, I was not yet a vampire...

107
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:58,033
...and I saw my last sunrise.

108
00:10:58,772 --> 00:11:01,036
I remember it completely...

109
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:05,110
...and yet I can't recall
any sunrise before it.

110
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:11,044
I watched the whole magnificence
of the dawn for the last time...

111
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:12,879
...as if it were the first.

112
00:11:17,057 --> 00:11:19,719
And then I said farewell to sunlight...

113
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,292
...and set out to become...

114
00:11:22,363 --> 00:11:23,762
...what I became.

115
00:11:43,584 --> 00:11:46,417
Have you said your
good-byes to the light?

116
00:12:08,776 --> 00:12:10,334
I've drained you...

117
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,604
...to the point of death.

118
00:12:13,781 --> 00:12:15,840
If I leave you here...

119
00:12:16,016 --> 00:12:17,347
...you die.

120
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,349
Or...

121
00:12:20,521 --> 00:12:23,684
...you can be young always, my friend...

122
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:26,689
...as we are now.

123
00:12:28,195 --> 00:12:30,129
But you must tell me...

124
00:12:30,697 --> 00:12:32,028
...will you come...

125
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:33,291
...or no?

126
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:38,466
Yes.

127
00:12:43,877 --> 00:12:45,208
Yes.

128
00:13:48,542 --> 00:13:50,442
Your body's dying.

129
00:13:50,711 --> 00:13:52,372
Pay no attention.

130
00:13:53,046 --> 00:13:54,946
It happens to us all.

131
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:26,136
Now look...

132
00:14:26,313 --> 00:14:28,645
...with your vampire eyes.

133
00:14:47,167 --> 00:14:48,600
What did you see?

134
00:14:49,503 --> 00:14:51,596
No words can describe it.

135
00:14:53,273 --> 00:14:55,764
Might as well ask heaven what it sees.

136
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:57,672
No human can know.

137
00:14:59,179 --> 00:15:01,773
The statue seemed to move, but didn't.

138
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:05,284
The world had changed,
yet stayed the same.

139
00:15:06,687 --> 00:15:10,623
I was a newborn vampire, weeping
at the beauty of the night.

140
00:15:16,363 --> 00:15:18,695
Perhaps you'd like another cigarette?

141
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:22,629
I would. It's not bothering you, is it?

142
00:15:22,869 --> 00:15:26,805
I don't assume it would.
It's not like you'll die from cancer.

143
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,133
I don't think so.

144
00:15:31,044 --> 00:15:33,535
- What about crucifixes?
- Crucifixes?

145
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:35,648
Can you look at them?

146
00:15:35,816 --> 00:15:38,478
Actually, I'm quite fond
of looking at crucifixes.

147
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:41,712
And the stake through the heart?

148
00:15:41,888 --> 00:15:42,980
Nonsense.

149
00:15:43,156 --> 00:15:44,384
And coffins?

150
00:15:45,325 --> 00:15:46,656
Coffins.

151
00:15:46,827 --> 00:15:49,557
Coffins, unfortunately, are a necessity.

152
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:53,564
Don't worry.

153
00:15:54,568 --> 00:15:55,728
Soon...

154
00:15:56,236 --> 00:15:59,672
...you'll be sleeping as
soundly as you've ever slept.

155
00:16:01,341 --> 00:16:03,241
And when you awake...

156
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:05,836
...l'll be waiting for you...

157
00:16:07,014 --> 00:16:09,574
...and so will all the world.

158
00:16:18,191 --> 00:16:21,524
Blood, I was to find,
was a necessity as well.

159
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:26,431
I awoke the next evening with
a hunger I had never felt.

160
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:30,194
Once you taste this...

161
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:33,533
...you'll never go to
another tavern again.

162
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:35,702
You think so?

163
00:16:36,710 --> 00:16:39,770
But what if I'd rather taste your lips?

164
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,874
My lips are even sweeter still.

165
00:16:58,298 --> 00:17:00,129
My friend...

166
00:17:00,634 --> 00:17:03,068
...should taste those lips.

167
00:17:03,303 --> 00:17:04,395
Is his...

168
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:05,798
...kiss...

169
00:17:05,972 --> 00:17:07,064
...as deep...

170
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,730
...as yours?

171
00:17:09,976 --> 00:17:11,807
Deeper, ma cherie.

172
00:17:45,112 --> 00:17:47,273
I will not take her life.

173
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:50,177
I've done it for you.

174
00:17:53,019 --> 00:17:54,509
She's dead...

175
00:17:55,522 --> 00:17:57,854
...as a doornail, my friend.

176
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:08,364
It's so easy, you almost
feel sorry for them.

177
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:16,599
You'll get used to killing.

178
00:18:16,777 --> 00:18:19,439
Just forget about that mortal coil.

179
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:22,207
You'll learn all too quickly.

180
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:32,224
Are you not hungry?

181
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:34,053
Quite the contrary, dear.

182
00:18:34,227 --> 00:18:36,218
He could eat the whole colony.

183
00:18:55,081 --> 00:18:56,241
I will finish it.

184
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,644
Now leave us.

185
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:07,253
Can't you pretend, you fool?

186
00:19:07,994 --> 00:19:10,155
Don't give the game away.

187
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:12,662
We're lucky to have such a home.

188
00:19:22,442 --> 00:19:24,933
Pretend to drink, at least.

189
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:32,445
Such fine crystal shouldn't go to waste.

190
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:54,868
I know.

191
00:19:55,141 --> 00:19:57,132
It gets cold so quickly.

192
00:19:57,477 --> 00:19:58,876
We can live like this?

193
00:19:59,145 --> 00:20:00,635
On animal blood?

194
00:20:00,814 --> 00:20:03,977
I wouldn't call it living.
Call it surviving.

195
00:20:04,484 --> 00:20:07,214
Useful trick if you're
on a ship for a month.

196
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:12,825
There's nothing in the world
now that doesn't hold some...

197
00:20:12,993 --> 00:20:14,324
Fascination.

198
00:20:15,395 --> 00:20:16,487
Yes.

199
00:20:18,064 --> 00:20:20,726
- I'm bored with this prattle.
- We can live without killing.

200
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:22,061
It's possible.

201
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:23,562
Anything is possible.

202
00:20:24,004 --> 00:20:25,995
But just try it for a week.

203
00:20:26,406 --> 00:20:30,900
Come into New Orleans and let
me show you some real sport.

204
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,420
Lestat killed two,
sometimes three a night.

205
00:20:45,258 --> 00:20:47,021
A fresh young girl...

206
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:49,923
...was his favorite for
the first of the evening.

207
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:54,256
For seconds, he preferred
a gilded, beautiful youth.

208
00:20:55,869 --> 00:20:59,270
But the snob in him
loved to hunt in society.

209
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:03,103
The blood of the aristocrat
thrilled him best of all.

210
00:21:04,210 --> 00:21:06,872
The trick is not to think about it.

211
00:21:07,213 --> 00:21:08,544
You see that one?

212
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:10,205
Widow St. Clair.

213
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:14,546
She had that gorgeous young
fop murder her husband.

214
00:21:14,955 --> 00:21:16,047
How do you know?

215
00:21:17,724 --> 00:21:19,282
Read her thoughts.

216
00:21:21,561 --> 00:21:23,290
Read her thoughts.

217
00:21:29,135 --> 00:21:30,466
I can't.

218
00:21:32,238 --> 00:21:34,900
The dark gift is
different for each of us.

219
00:21:35,241 --> 00:21:39,405
But one thing is true of everyone.
We grow stronger as we go along.

220
00:21:40,313 --> 00:21:42,304
Just take my word for it.

221
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,976
She blamed a slave for his murder.

222
00:21:46,152 --> 00:21:48,245
Imagine what they did to him.

223
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:52,083
Evil-doers are easier,
and they taste better.

224
00:22:24,124 --> 00:22:25,614
Where are we going?

225
00:22:33,199 --> 00:22:34,359
Nowhere.

226
00:22:35,468 --> 00:22:38,631
Now, young man, you really amaze me!

227
00:22:41,374 --> 00:22:44,639
I'm old enough to be your grandmother.

228
00:22:58,825 --> 00:23:01,225
Oh, yes, that's the melody.

229
00:23:01,728 --> 00:23:03,389
I remember it.

230
00:23:15,408 --> 00:23:17,000
Murder!

231
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:18,738
My papillons!

232
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:21,403
My little butterflies, he killed them!

233
00:23:24,417 --> 00:23:25,179
You...

234
00:23:25,351 --> 00:23:27,512
...whining coward of a vampire...

235
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:31,384
...who prowls killing rats and poodles!
You could've finished us!

236
00:23:31,558 --> 00:23:32,582
You condemned me to hell!

237
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,192
I don't know any hell.

238
00:23:39,365 --> 00:23:41,196
That's more like it!

239
00:23:41,434 --> 00:23:42,765
Anger! Fury!

240
00:23:42,936 --> 00:23:45,530
That's why I chose you!

241
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,270
But you can't kill me, Louis.

242
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,382
Feed...

243
00:24:01,955 --> 00:24:03,718
...on what you will.

244
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,055
Rats, chickens...

245
00:24:06,226 --> 00:24:07,386
...poodles.

246
00:24:08,561 --> 00:24:10,290
I'll leave you to it...

247
00:24:10,563 --> 00:24:12,724
...and watch you come around.

248
00:24:12,966 --> 00:24:13,898
Remember:

249
00:24:14,467 --> 00:24:16,560
Life without me...

250
00:24:16,736 --> 00:24:18,397
...would be even more...

251
00:24:18,571 --> 00:24:19,902
...unbearable.

252
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:20,956
Consider yourself lucky.

253
00:25:22,035 --> 00:25:25,198
In Paris, a vampire must be
clever for many reasons.

254
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:27,195
Paris?

255
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:30,373
Here all one needs is a pair of fangs.

256
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:33,040
You came from Paris?

257
00:25:33,213 --> 00:25:35,545
As did the one who made me.

258
00:25:37,317 --> 00:25:40,480
Tell me about him. You must've
learned something from him.

259
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:45,221
I learned absolutely nothing.

260
00:25:46,326 --> 00:25:48,988
I wasn't given a choice, remember?

261
00:25:49,662 --> 00:25:52,153
You must know something
about the meaning of it all.

262
00:25:52,332 --> 00:25:55,062
Why?! Why should I know these things?!

263
00:25:55,235 --> 00:25:56,725
Do you know them?

264
00:25:56,903 --> 00:25:58,063
That noise...

265
00:25:58,238 --> 00:26:00,331
...it's driving me mad!

266
00:26:00,506 --> 00:26:03,737
We've been here for weeks
with nothing but that noise!

267
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,502
They know about us.

268
00:26:05,678 --> 00:26:09,580
They watch us dine on empty plates
and drink from empty glasses.

269
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,510
Come...

270
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:13,413
...to New Orleans then.

271
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:17,414
The Paris Opera's in town.
We can try some French...

272
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:18,921
...cuisine.

273
00:26:19,592 --> 00:26:22,755
Forgive me if I have a
lingering respect for life.

274
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:27,865
You'll soon run out of chickens, Louis.

275
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:01,965
Monsieur Louis?

276
00:27:02,969 --> 00:27:04,800
You don't want any supper?

277
00:27:06,572 --> 00:27:07,630
No, dear.

278
00:27:08,808 --> 00:27:10,969
We're worried about you, Master.

279
00:27:13,146 --> 00:27:15,740
When do you go riding in the field?

280
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:19,916
And how long since you've
been to the slave quarter?

281
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:25,080
Everywhere there is death.

282
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,094
Are you still our master at all?

283
00:27:30,263 --> 00:27:32,163
That will be all, Yvette.

284
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:35,593
I will not go unless you listen to me.

285
00:27:37,337 --> 00:27:39,931
You must send away this friend of yours.

286
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:43,601
The slaves are all frightened of him...

287
00:27:45,178 --> 00:27:47,339
...and they are frightened of you.

288
00:27:52,785 --> 00:27:54,946
I'm frightened of myself.

289
00:28:43,236 --> 00:28:44,999
Hear me now!

290
00:28:45,405 --> 00:28:47,396
This place is cursed!

291
00:28:47,573 --> 00:28:48,904
Damned!

292
00:28:49,242 --> 00:28:51,836
And, yes, your master is the devil!

293
00:28:52,845 --> 00:28:55,507
Get out while you can! You're all free!

294
00:28:55,915 --> 00:28:57,348
Do you hear me?!

295
00:28:58,418 --> 00:28:59,510
Run!

296
00:28:59,685 --> 00:29:00,413
Run!

297
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:02,745
Save yourselves!

298
00:29:51,304 --> 00:29:53,067
Perfect! Perfect!

299
00:29:53,406 --> 00:29:56,898
Just burn the place!
Burn everything we own!

300
00:29:57,243 --> 00:29:59,803
Have us living in a field, like cattle!

301
00:29:59,979 --> 00:30:01,970
You thought you could have it all.

302
00:30:02,148 --> 00:30:03,638
Shut up, Louis!

303
00:30:04,817 --> 00:30:06,079
Come on!

304
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,698
Where are we?

305
00:30:29,542 --> 00:30:32,204
Where do you think, my idiot friend?

306
00:30:32,378 --> 00:30:34,869
We're in a nice, filthy cemetery.

307
00:30:35,715 --> 00:30:37,205
Are you happy?

308
00:30:37,383 --> 00:30:39,874
Is this fitting? Proper enough?

309
00:30:40,553 --> 00:30:42,282
We belong in hell.

310
00:30:42,488 --> 00:30:44,217
What if there is no hell?

311
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:47,484
Or they don't want us there?
Ever think of that?

312
00:30:50,062 --> 00:30:51,620
But there was a hell.

313
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:55,058
And no matter where we
moved to, I was in it.

314
00:30:56,569 --> 00:30:59,732
We rented rooms on the
waterfront of New Orleans.

315
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,299
Your skin is icy.

316
00:31:24,197 --> 00:31:26,427
Your friend has no head for wine.

317
00:31:30,603 --> 00:31:32,264
Don't worry.

318
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:36,539
I can warm that cold skin of
yours better than she can.

319
00:31:36,709 --> 00:31:38,108
Do you think so?

320
00:31:39,545 --> 00:31:40,603
Why...

321
00:31:41,047 --> 00:31:42,708
...you're warm now!

322
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:46,111
But the price is high.

323
00:31:46,285 --> 00:31:48,776
Your pretty friend, I exhausted her.

324
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:53,855
Soft.

325
00:31:55,795 --> 00:31:57,456
So soft.

326
00:31:59,131 --> 00:32:02,066
I can see you lying on a bed of satin.

327
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:05,230
Such things you say.

328
00:32:06,739 --> 00:32:08,866
Do you know what manner of bed?

329
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:37,826
Should we put out the light?

330
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:45,673
And then put out the light.

331
00:33:00,293 --> 00:33:02,420
But once put out thy light...

332
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:05,424
...I cannot...

333
00:33:06,632 --> 00:33:09,192
...give it vital breath again.

334
00:33:11,037 --> 00:33:13,028
It needs must wither.

335
00:33:25,217 --> 00:33:26,707
For you, Louis.

336
00:33:26,886 --> 00:33:28,717
You can pretend it's wine.

337
00:33:38,831 --> 00:33:39,957
She's not dead!

338
00:33:40,166 --> 00:33:44,068
You're in love with your mortal nature.
You resist what can bring you peace.

339
00:33:44,236 --> 00:33:45,464
You call this peace?!

340
00:33:45,671 --> 00:33:49,471
We're predators, whose all-seeing
eyes give them detachment!

341
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:52,233
- The girl, Lestat!
- Take her! End that hunger!

342
00:33:52,411 --> 00:33:53,400
No!

343
00:34:00,186 --> 00:34:01,744
Now, my child.

344
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:06,089
You're tired, you want to sleep!

345
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:17,193
It's a coffin!

346
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,099
A coffin! Let me out!

347
00:34:19,872 --> 00:34:21,362
I'm not dead!

348
00:34:21,507 --> 00:34:26,103
It's your coffin, enjoy it. Most of us
never get to know what it feels like.

349
00:34:26,278 --> 00:34:27,609
Why do you do this?

350
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:32,613
I like to do it. I enjoy it.
Take your aesthete's taste to purer things.

351
00:34:32,785 --> 00:34:35,618
Kill them swiftly if
you will, but do it!

352
00:34:35,788 --> 00:34:38,518
For do not doubt you
are a killer, Louis!

353
00:34:45,731 --> 00:34:48,393
- What's that?
- It's a coffin.

354
00:34:49,402 --> 00:34:51,461
So it is. You must be dead.

355
00:34:53,038 --> 00:34:54,801
I'm not dead, am I?

356
00:34:55,141 --> 00:34:56,403
You're not dead.

357
00:34:56,542 --> 00:34:57,804
Not yet.

358
00:34:57,977 --> 00:34:59,638
Finish this now!

359
00:34:59,812 --> 00:35:00,904
You finish it!

360
00:35:01,046 --> 00:35:02,741
Save me from him!

361
00:35:03,048 --> 00:35:04,037
Save me!

362
00:35:06,252 --> 00:35:07,651
You'll let me go?

363
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:10,247
I can't die like this!

364
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:11,816
I need a priest.

365
00:35:11,991 --> 00:35:14,755
My friend is a priest. He'll
hear your sins before you die.

366
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,986
Unless... I make her one of us.

367
00:35:17,163 --> 00:35:18,061
No!

368
00:35:18,264 --> 00:35:22,166
Then take her, Louis, end
her suffering! End yours!

369
00:35:23,269 --> 00:35:24,258
No!

370
00:35:43,456 --> 00:35:44,855
Now...

371
00:35:45,191 --> 00:35:46,852
...are you happy?

372
00:35:50,796 --> 00:35:52,195
My God!

373
00:35:54,099 --> 00:35:55,794
To think you...

374
00:35:55,968 --> 00:35:58,300
...are all I have to learn from.

375
00:36:01,807 --> 00:36:03,866
In the Old World...

376
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:07,372
...they called it the dark gift.

377
00:36:10,049 --> 00:36:12,210
And I gave it to you.

378
00:36:34,139 --> 00:36:37,131
Don't go that way, Monsieur.
It's the plague.

379
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:40,741
- Go back the way you came!
- The way I came...

380
00:36:56,295 --> 00:36:56,886
Mama.

381
00:37:21,287 --> 00:37:23,278
Please help us.

382
00:37:23,556 --> 00:37:25,956
Papa left us and didn't come back.

383
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:36,393
Please, wake Mama, Monsieur.

384
00:38:03,429 --> 00:38:05,920
My philosopher. My martyr.

385
00:38:06,098 --> 00:38:08,498
"Never take a human life."

386
00:38:10,235 --> 00:38:12,499
This calls for a celebration.

387
00:38:22,181 --> 00:38:24,945
There's life in the old lady yet.

388
00:38:28,354 --> 00:38:29,753
Come back!

389
00:38:29,955 --> 00:38:32,116
You are what you are!

390
00:38:34,126 --> 00:38:36,117
Merciful death.

391
00:38:36,962 --> 00:38:39,692
How you love your precious guilt.

392
00:38:49,208 --> 00:38:51,199
Her blood coursed in my veins...

393
00:38:51,377 --> 00:38:53,368
...sweeter than life itself.

394
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:55,846
And, as it did, Lestat's
words made sense to me.

395
00:38:56,015 --> 00:38:57,846
I knew peace only when I killed.

396
00:38:58,017 --> 00:39:02,716
When I heard her heart in that terrible
rhythm, I knew what peace could be.

397
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:40,682
All I need to find you, Louis,
is follow the corpses of rats.

398
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:50,934
Pain is terrible for you.

399
00:39:52,204 --> 00:39:55,935
You feel it like no other creature,
because you're a vampire.

400
00:39:57,609 --> 00:39:59,873
You don't want it to go on.

401
00:40:00,045 --> 00:40:01,205
No.

402
00:40:04,216 --> 00:40:07,947
Then do what it is in
your nature to do...

403
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:11,715
...and you will feel as you felt
with that child in your arms.

404
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:15,717
Evil is a point of view.

405
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:18,723
God kills indiscriminately...

406
00:40:19,965 --> 00:40:21,796
...and so shall we.

407
00:40:22,735 --> 00:40:27,570
For no creatures under God are
as we are. None so like Him...

408
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,968
...as ourselves.

409
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,640
I have a gift for you.

410
00:40:35,247 --> 00:40:36,578
Come.

411
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:41,308
Please.

412
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,932
- She's here.
- What are you saying?

413
00:40:58,437 --> 00:40:59,995
You need...

414
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:01,929
...company...

415
00:41:02,107 --> 00:41:04,337
...more congenial than mine.

416
00:41:09,348 --> 00:41:11,339
Remember how you wanted her?

417
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:13,943
The taste of her?

418
00:41:15,854 --> 00:41:17,947
I thought I'd killed her.

419
00:41:20,959 --> 00:41:22,358
Don't worry.

420
00:41:24,129 --> 00:41:25,960
Your conscience is clear.

421
00:41:38,977 --> 00:41:40,205
Claudia.

422
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:48,709
Listen to me.

423
00:41:49,488 --> 00:41:51,388
You're ill, my precious.

424
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:55,826
And I'm going to give you
what you need to get well.

425
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,400
No.

426
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:12,006
You want her to die then?

427
00:42:27,192 --> 00:42:28,921
That's it. Yes.

428
00:42:43,108 --> 00:42:44,268
Stop!

429
00:42:46,712 --> 00:42:48,111
Stop!

430
00:42:48,614 --> 00:42:49,774
Enough!

431
00:43:29,321 --> 00:43:30,811
I want some more.

432
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:33,480
Of course you want more.

433
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:05,019
Gently, cherie.

434
00:44:06,024 --> 00:44:08,015
They're so innocent.

435
00:44:09,361 --> 00:44:11,522
They must not be made to suffer.

436
00:44:12,798 --> 00:44:14,026
Good.

437
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:17,461
Yes.

438
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:19,136
All right, now.

439
00:44:19,304 --> 00:44:20,464
Stop.

440
00:44:23,041 --> 00:44:25,032
That's enough, cherie.

441
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:28,204
You must stop before the heart stops.

442
00:44:29,381 --> 00:44:30,473
I want more.

443
00:44:30,716 --> 00:44:31,978
I know.

444
00:44:32,217 --> 00:44:34,208
But it's best in the beginning...

445
00:44:34,553 --> 00:44:37,317
...lest the death
takes you down with it.

446
00:44:38,323 --> 00:44:40,553
You've done very well. Look at you.

447
00:44:40,826 --> 00:44:43,158
Not a drop spilt. Very good.

448
00:44:45,897 --> 00:44:47,387
Where is Mama?

449
00:44:50,836 --> 00:44:52,667
Mama's gone...

450
00:44:53,005 --> 00:44:56,236
...to heaven, cherie,
like that sweet lady...

451
00:44:56,408 --> 00:44:57,500
...right there.

452
00:44:57,676 --> 00:44:59,337
They all go to heaven.

453
00:44:59,911 --> 00:45:01,401
All but us.

454
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:04,913
Do you want to frighten our daughter?

455
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:06,573
I'm not your daughter.

456
00:45:06,752 --> 00:45:08,344
Oh, yes, you are.

457
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:11,081
You're mine and Louis' daughter now.

458
00:45:11,523 --> 00:45:14,253
You see, Louis was going to leave us.

459
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:17,191
He was going to go away.

460
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:19,686
But now he's not.

461
00:45:20,699 --> 00:45:22,428
Now he's going to stay...

462
00:45:22,601 --> 00:45:24,432
...and make you happy.

463
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:27,864
Louis.

464
00:45:33,779 --> 00:45:35,440
You fiend.

465
00:45:36,048 --> 00:45:37,879
One happy family.

466
00:45:47,459 --> 00:45:49,450
He did it to make you stay with him?

467
00:45:49,628 --> 00:45:51,061
Perhaps.

468
00:45:51,229 --> 00:45:55,461
He knew me. He knew I would love
her more than the waking world.

469
00:45:57,235 --> 00:45:59,226
But there was more to it.

470
00:45:59,738 --> 00:46:03,299
He lavished affection on her,
there is no doubt about that.

471
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:08,641
Perhaps, in the end, he did
it because he was lonely too.

472
00:46:09,915 --> 00:46:11,644
- I need more light.
- She needs more light.

473
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:14,411
- I'll go blind without another lamp.
- She'll go blind.

474
00:46:14,586 --> 00:46:16,918
Or let me fit this child during the day.

475
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:20,921
Well, I am afraid, madame,
that my days are sacrosanct.

476
00:46:22,327 --> 00:46:24,488
A little child, she was.

477
00:46:24,663 --> 00:46:26,597
But also a fierce killer...

478
00:46:26,765 --> 00:46:31,668
...now capable of the ruthless pursuit
of blood with all a child's demanding.

479
00:46:33,338 --> 00:46:35,101
Let me kiss it better.

480
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,112
Now...

481
00:46:50,689 --> 00:46:54,352
...who will we get to finish
your dress? Be practical!

482
00:46:54,526 --> 00:46:56,790
Remember, never in our home!

483
00:46:57,696 --> 00:47:00,460
She slept in my coffin at first...

484
00:47:00,632 --> 00:47:03,533
...curling her little
fingers around my hair...

485
00:47:03,702 --> 00:47:06,364
...till the day when she
wanted her own coffin.

486
00:47:14,045 --> 00:47:16,479
But still, whenever she awoke...

487
00:47:16,715 --> 00:47:18,376
...she would crawl into mine.

488
00:47:29,728 --> 00:47:33,562
They died fast in those days, before
she learned to play with them...

489
00:47:33,732 --> 00:47:37,168
...to delay the moment till
she had taken what she wanted.

490
00:47:50,916 --> 00:47:53,180
Why are you crying, child?

491
00:47:53,351 --> 00:47:55,012
Are you lost, my love?

492
00:47:55,353 --> 00:47:56,752
Mama!

493
00:47:57,923 --> 00:47:59,857
Hush, now, don't cry.

494
00:48:00,025 --> 00:48:01,686
We'll find her.

495
00:48:08,533 --> 00:48:12,264
Mind the thumb, girl. Mind the thumb.
That little digit.

496
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:29,111
They're expensive, my dear.

497
00:48:30,455 --> 00:48:33,947
Maybe too expensive for
a young girl like you.

498
00:48:47,739 --> 00:48:49,900
Claudia! What have we told you?!

499
00:48:50,642 --> 00:48:52,405
Never in the house.

500
00:48:54,646 --> 00:48:56,136
Give me some room.

501
00:48:57,482 --> 00:48:59,245
To me, she was a child.

502
00:48:59,417 --> 00:49:01,817
But to Lestat, a pupil...

503
00:49:02,153 --> 00:49:05,213
...an infant prodigy with a
lust for killing like his own.

504
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:09,151
Together, they finished
off whole families.

505
00:49:16,167 --> 00:49:17,930
Wonderful, wonderful.

506
00:49:18,169 --> 00:49:20,933
Now try something on
a more somber note.

507
00:49:34,619 --> 00:49:37,611
Time can pass quickly for
mortals when they're happy.

508
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:39,848
With us, it was the same.

509
00:49:40,025 --> 00:49:43,358
The years flew by like minutes.
The city grew.

510
00:49:43,528 --> 00:49:45,689
Sailboats gave way to steamships...

511
00:49:45,864 --> 00:49:49,800
...disgorging an endless menu
of magnificent strangers.

512
00:49:50,635 --> 00:49:52,796
A new world had sprung up around us.

513
00:49:52,971 --> 00:49:55,303
And we were all Americans now.

514
00:50:03,481 --> 00:50:05,472
This filthy modern tide!

515
00:50:05,817 --> 00:50:10,220
What I wouldn't give for a drop
of old-fashioned Creole blood!

516
00:50:10,388 --> 00:50:12,720
Yankees are not to your taste?

517
00:50:12,991 --> 00:50:16,552
Their democratic flavor
doesn't suit my palate, Louis.

518
00:50:35,080 --> 00:50:37,071
Now that is pure Creole.

519
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:43,080
Trust Claudia to have found her.

520
00:50:45,790 --> 00:50:46,848
What?

521
00:50:47,592 --> 00:50:49,025
Don't you want her?

522
00:50:49,527 --> 00:50:51,290
I want to be her.

523
00:50:53,865 --> 00:50:54,854
Can I?

524
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,590
Be like her one day?

525
00:51:00,939 --> 00:51:04,534
More melancholy nonsense.
You grow more like Louis daily!

526
00:51:04,709 --> 00:51:06,040
Soon you'll eat rats.

527
00:51:08,046 --> 00:51:10,947
Rats? When did you eat rats, Louis?

528
00:51:11,816 --> 00:51:13,807
It was a long, long time ago.

529
00:51:13,952 --> 00:51:15,544
Before you were born.

530
00:51:16,821 --> 00:51:18,721
And I don't recommend them.

531
00:51:21,459 --> 00:51:26,055
Thirty years had passed, yet her body
remained that of an eternal child.

532
00:51:26,965 --> 00:51:31,459
Her eyes alone told the story of her
age, staring from under her curls...

533
00:51:31,636 --> 00:51:32,967
...with a questioning...

534
00:51:33,138 --> 00:51:35,629
...that would one day need an answer.

535
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:46,914
Another doll.

536
00:51:47,085 --> 00:51:49,246
I have dozens, you realize.

537
00:51:50,155 --> 00:51:52,350
I thought you could use one more.

538
00:51:53,158 --> 00:51:55,251
Why always on this night?

539
00:51:56,428 --> 00:51:57,918
What do you mean?

540
00:51:58,096 --> 00:52:01,259
You always give me a doll on
the same night of the year.

541
00:52:03,001 --> 00:52:04,662
I didn't realize.

542
00:52:04,869 --> 00:52:06,666
Is this my birthday?

543
00:52:11,109 --> 00:52:13,100
You dress me like a doll.

544
00:52:13,611 --> 00:52:15,442
You make my hair like a doll.

545
00:52:15,613 --> 00:52:16,602
Why?

546
00:52:17,182 --> 00:52:20,379
Some of these, Claudia, are so old...

547
00:52:20,952 --> 00:52:22,180
...tattered.

548
00:52:23,388 --> 00:52:26,289
- You should throw them away.
- I will, then!

549
00:52:39,537 --> 00:52:41,129
What have you done?

550
00:52:41,306 --> 00:52:43,297
What you told me to do!

551
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:46,410
- You leave a corpse here to rot?
- I wanted her!

552
00:52:46,544 --> 00:52:48,910
- I wanted to be her!
- She's mad!

553
00:52:49,047 --> 00:52:51,709
She pollutes the very house we live in!

554
00:52:52,717 --> 00:52:55,652
Do you want me to be a doll forever?

555
00:52:56,821 --> 00:52:57,981
Don't!

556
00:52:58,156 --> 00:53:00,317
Why not? Can't I change...

557
00:53:00,492 --> 00:53:01,720
...like everyone else?

558
00:53:28,353 --> 00:53:30,253
Which one of you did it?

559
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,846
Which one of you did it?!

560
00:53:33,024 --> 00:53:35,686
Which one of you made me the way I am?

561
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:37,259
What you are?

562
00:53:37,462 --> 00:53:40,863
A vampire gone insane,
that pollutes its own bed!

563
00:53:41,032 --> 00:53:42,761
And if I cut my hair again?

564
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:44,867
It will grow back again.

565
00:53:45,036 --> 00:53:46,594
But it wasn't always so!

566
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:49,535
I had a mother once.
And Louis, he had a wife.

567
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:51,874
He was mortal, same as she.

568
00:53:52,043 --> 00:53:53,874
And so was I!

569
00:53:54,112 --> 00:53:55,773
You made us what we are!

570
00:53:56,047 --> 00:53:57,378
Stop her.

571
00:53:57,615 --> 00:53:59,207
Did you do it to me?!

572
00:54:06,124 --> 00:54:07,557
How did you do it?

573
00:54:07,725 --> 00:54:09,886
And why should I tell you?

574
00:54:10,562 --> 00:54:12,496
It's in my power.

575
00:54:13,131 --> 00:54:14,894
Why yours alone?

576
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:16,795
Tell me how it was done!

577
00:54:17,135 --> 00:54:18,397
Be glad...

578
00:54:18,570 --> 00:54:20,629
...I made you what you are.

579
00:54:22,006 --> 00:54:24,065
You'd be dead now if I hadn't.

580
00:54:24,242 --> 00:54:27,143
Like that damned corpse!
Now get rid of it!

581
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:29,243
You get rid of it.

582
00:54:40,425 --> 00:54:41,915
Louis, why?

583
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,151
You've got to tell me.

584
00:54:50,602 --> 00:54:52,331
You see the old woman?

585
00:54:53,438 --> 00:54:55,429
That will never happen to you.

586
00:54:56,441 --> 00:54:58,272
You will never grow old.

587
00:54:58,943 --> 00:55:00,672
And you will never die.

588
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,841
And it means something
else too, doesn't it?

589
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,854
I shall never, ever grow up.

590
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:18,294
I hate him.

591
00:55:20,632 --> 00:55:24,068
Tell me how it came
to be that I am this...

592
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:26,063
...thing.

593
00:55:32,143 --> 00:55:35,135
For thirty years I'd avoided that place.

594
00:55:36,648 --> 00:55:39,139
Yet I found my way back there...

595
00:55:39,317 --> 00:55:42,081
...with hardly an upward glance.

596
00:55:57,735 --> 00:55:58,997
You...

597
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,831
...fed on me?

598
00:56:01,239 --> 00:56:02,399
Yes.

599
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:06,176
And he found me with you.

600
00:56:08,613 --> 00:56:11,673
Then he cut his wrist
and fed you from him...

601
00:56:12,016 --> 00:56:14,109
...and you were a vampire then...

602
00:56:14,352 --> 00:56:16,843
...and have been every night thereafter.

603
00:56:20,191 --> 00:56:21,920
You both did it.

604
00:56:22,627 --> 00:56:24,356
I took your life.

605
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:28,764
He gave you another one.

606
00:56:30,535 --> 00:56:32,366
And here it is.

607
00:56:32,537 --> 00:56:34,266
I hate you both.

608
00:56:46,884 --> 00:56:48,715
I walked all night.

609
00:56:49,954 --> 00:56:52,286
I walked as I walked years before...

610
00:56:52,457 --> 00:56:55,392
...when my mind swam with guilt
at the thought of killing.

611
00:56:57,061 --> 00:57:01,293
I thought of all the things
I'd done and couldn't undo.

612
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,800
And I longed for one second's peace.

613
00:57:14,245 --> 00:57:16,577
Locked together in hatred.

614
00:57:21,319 --> 00:57:23,480
But I can't hate you, Louis.

615
00:57:29,927 --> 00:57:31,827
Louis, my love.

616
00:57:33,698 --> 00:57:35,757
I was mortal till you...

617
00:57:37,201 --> 00:57:39,601
...gave me your immortal kiss.

618
00:57:41,272 --> 00:57:44,435
You became my mother and my father.

619
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:48,342
And so I'm yours forever.

620
00:57:50,515 --> 00:57:53,109
But now it's time to end it, Louis.

621
00:57:54,619 --> 00:57:56,951
Now it's time to leave him.

622
00:58:00,725 --> 00:58:02,784
He will never let us go.

623
00:58:14,639 --> 00:58:15,799
Really?

624
00:58:27,752 --> 00:58:30,744
What is it now? You irritate me.
Your very presence...

625
00:58:30,888 --> 00:58:31,980
...irritates me!

626
00:58:32,156 --> 00:58:33,555
Does it?

627
00:58:33,758 --> 00:58:36,818
I found someone who'll be a
vampire better than you both!

628
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:39,252
Is that supposed to frighten me?

629
00:58:40,064 --> 00:58:43,397
You're spoiled, because
you're an only child.

630
00:58:44,001 --> 00:58:45,400
You need a brother.

631
00:58:46,337 --> 00:58:47,565
Or I do.

632
00:58:48,272 --> 00:58:50,069
I weary of you both.

633
00:58:50,775 --> 00:58:53,573
I suppose we could people
the world with vampires...

634
00:58:53,845 --> 00:58:55,506
...the three of us.

635
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,838
Oh, not you...

636
00:58:58,015 --> 00:58:59,778
...my little Claudia.

637
00:59:00,284 --> 00:59:01,842
You're a liar.

638
00:59:02,787 --> 00:59:04,846
But you upset my plans.

639
00:59:05,923 --> 00:59:07,788
What plans?

640
00:59:08,693 --> 00:59:10,524
I came to make peace with you.

641
00:59:11,195 --> 00:59:13,857
Even though you're the father of lies...

642
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:16,932
...I want things to be as they were.

643
00:59:18,102 --> 00:59:19,865
Stop pestering me then.

644
00:59:23,441 --> 00:59:25,705
I must do more than that.

645
00:59:26,711 --> 00:59:28,611
I've brought a present for you.

646
00:59:31,215 --> 00:59:32,705
Then I hope it's...

647
00:59:32,884 --> 00:59:34,442
...a beautiful woman...

648
00:59:35,052 --> 00:59:38,112
...with endowments you'll never possess.

649
00:59:41,559 --> 00:59:43,459
Why do you say such things?

650
00:59:52,403 --> 00:59:54,337
You haven't fed enough.

651
00:59:55,072 --> 00:59:56,972
I can tell by your color.

652
01:00:03,481 --> 01:00:04,971
Come and see.

653
01:00:21,732 --> 01:00:23,666
Don't be angry with me.

654
01:00:23,801 --> 01:00:26,463
When I saw them, I knew
they were for you.

655
01:00:27,905 --> 01:00:29,065
Drunk...

656
01:00:29,907 --> 01:00:32,467
...on brandywine. A thimbleful.

657
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:42,980
You certainly have...

658
01:00:43,187 --> 01:00:44,677
...outdone yourself.

659
01:00:46,490 --> 01:00:49,084
I promise I'll get rid of the bodies.

660
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:04,705
We forgive each other then?

661
01:01:06,210 --> 01:01:07,438
Yes.

662
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,222
Absinthe?

663
01:01:26,964 --> 01:01:28,864
You've given them absinthe?

664
01:01:29,233 --> 01:01:30,222
No.

665
01:01:30,634 --> 01:01:31,726
Laudanum.

666
01:01:33,237 --> 01:01:34,226
Laudanum.

667
01:01:34,538 --> 01:01:35,527
Yes.

668
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,301
It killed them, unfortunately.

669
01:01:38,976 --> 01:01:41,035
But it keeps the blood warm.

670
01:01:45,316 --> 01:01:46,544
You let me drink...

671
01:01:48,753 --> 01:01:50,380
...dead blood?

672
01:01:50,888 --> 01:01:52,651
You let me...

673
01:01:52,823 --> 01:01:53,881
...drink...

674
01:01:55,059 --> 01:01:57,254
One lesson you taught me...

675
01:01:57,395 --> 01:01:59,260
...never drink from the dead.

676
01:02:02,266 --> 01:02:04,166
Put me in my coffin.

677
01:02:04,502 --> 01:02:05,901
Put me in my coffin.

678
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,560
I'll put you in your coffin!

679
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:14,066
My God!

680
01:02:31,595 --> 01:02:33,085
Lift me up!

681
01:02:47,878 --> 01:02:49,709
Good night, sweet prince.

682
01:02:51,449 --> 01:02:55,112
May flights of devils
wing you to your rest.

683
01:02:56,821 --> 01:02:58,550
Should we burn him?

684
01:02:58,722 --> 01:02:59,950
Bury him?

685
01:03:00,224 --> 01:03:02,055
What would he have liked?

686
01:03:06,063 --> 01:03:07,223
The swamp?

687
01:03:30,654 --> 01:03:32,645
He belongs with those reptiles.

688
01:03:34,992 --> 01:03:36,983
He deserved to die.

689
01:03:38,095 --> 01:03:40,996
Then perhaps so do we,
every night of our lives.

690
01:03:44,435 --> 01:03:46,266
He was my maker.

691
01:03:47,271 --> 01:03:48,932
He gave me this life...

692
01:03:49,106 --> 01:03:50,664
...whatever it is.

693
01:03:53,777 --> 01:03:56,007
It shouldn't have been this way.

694
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,508
I did it for us.

695
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:01,117
So we could be free.

696
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:08,789
You missed him?

697
01:04:10,461 --> 01:04:12,019
He was all I knew.

698
01:04:12,196 --> 01:04:13,891
It's as simple as that.

699
01:04:14,965 --> 01:04:17,798
We were like two orphans
learning to live again.

700
01:04:20,037 --> 01:04:21,698
We booked passage to Europe.

701
01:04:22,973 --> 01:04:25,533
Over the weeks, waiting for the boat...

702
01:04:25,709 --> 01:04:29,304
...she studied the myths and
legends of the Old World...

703
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:32,540
...obsessed with the search of
what she called "our kind."

704
01:04:47,331 --> 01:04:49,060
Look who we forgot.

705
01:04:53,437 --> 01:04:55,166
Let's set them free.

706
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:57,668
Yes.

707
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:04,741
It's the carriage.

708
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:52,990
Listen, Louis...

709
01:05:54,798 --> 01:05:56,390
...there's life...

710
01:05:56,567 --> 01:05:58,728
...in these old hands still.

711
01:06:01,572 --> 01:06:03,802
Not quite furioso.

712
01:06:06,577 --> 01:06:07,908
Moderato...

713
01:06:09,146 --> 01:06:10,807
...cantabile, perhaps.

714
01:06:11,315 --> 01:06:13,078
How could it be?

715
01:06:13,317 --> 01:06:15,148
Ask the alligator.

716
01:06:15,919 --> 01:06:17,750
His blood helped.

717
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:23,821
Then, on the diet of
the blood of snakes...

718
01:06:24,595 --> 01:06:25,755
...toads...

719
01:06:27,931 --> 01:06:30,331
...and all the putrid life...

720
01:06:30,601 --> 01:06:32,330
...of the Mississippi...

721
01:06:33,671 --> 01:06:35,036
...slowly...

722
01:06:36,273 --> 01:06:38,673
...Lestat became something...

723
01:06:38,942 --> 01:06:40,773
...like himself again.

724
01:06:45,683 --> 01:06:47,173
You've been...

725
01:06:47,785 --> 01:06:49,343
...a very...

726
01:06:49,787 --> 01:06:51,049
...very...

727
01:06:51,188 --> 01:06:52,678
...naughty little girl.

728
01:07:55,185 --> 01:07:57,346
The ship is sailing without us!

729
01:08:16,940 --> 01:08:19,135
Though the fire seemed to spread...

730
01:08:19,710 --> 01:08:23,646
...I stood on that deck, fearful
he would come out again...

731
01:08:23,781 --> 01:08:26,773
...from the river like some
monster, to destroy us.

732
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:30,044
And all the while I thought...

733
01:08:30,554 --> 01:08:31,543
"Lestat...

734
01:08:31,889 --> 01:08:33,948
...we deserve your vengeance.

735
01:08:34,892 --> 01:08:36,450
You gave me the dark gift...

736
01:08:37,461 --> 01:08:41,659
...and I delivered you into the
hands of death for the second time."

737
01:08:58,615 --> 01:09:02,107
Though the ship was
blessedly free of rats...

738
01:09:02,286 --> 01:09:06,120
...a strange plague nonetheless
struck its passengers.

739
01:09:07,524 --> 01:09:10,015
Claudia and I alone seemed immune.

740
01:09:11,628 --> 01:09:13,687
We kept to ourselves...

741
01:09:13,864 --> 01:09:16,458
...pondering the mystery of each other.

742
01:09:19,203 --> 01:09:20,795
We reached the Mediterranean.

743
01:09:21,038 --> 01:09:25,031
I wanted those waters to be blue.
But they were black...

744
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,865
...night-time waters.

745
01:09:27,044 --> 01:09:29,035
And how I suffered then...

746
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:33,382
...straining to recall the color
that in my youth I took for granted.

747
01:09:39,723 --> 01:09:41,987
We searched village after village...

748
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:43,558
...ruin after ruin...

749
01:09:43,727 --> 01:09:45,558
...country after country.

750
01:09:45,896 --> 01:09:47,989
And always we found nothing.

751
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:53,892
I began to believe
we were the only ones.

752
01:09:55,339 --> 01:09:58,172
There was a strange
comfort in that thought.

753
01:09:58,509 --> 01:10:02,240
For what could the damned really
have to say to the damned?

754
01:10:04,081 --> 01:10:05,412
You found nothing?

755
01:10:05,582 --> 01:10:07,015
Peasant rumors...

756
01:10:07,518 --> 01:10:09,577
...superstitions about garlic...

757
01:10:09,753 --> 01:10:11,015
...crosses...

758
01:10:11,188 --> 01:10:13,349
...the old stake in the hearts.

759
01:10:14,424 --> 01:10:16,358
But one of our kind?

760
01:10:16,527 --> 01:10:17,858
Not a whisper.

761
01:10:19,696 --> 01:10:23,860
There are no vampires in Transylvania?
No Count Dracula?

762
01:10:24,034 --> 01:10:25,365
Fictions, my friend.

763
01:10:25,769 --> 01:10:28,533
The vulgar fictions of
a demented Irishman.

764
01:10:29,706 --> 01:10:30,695
Paris...

765
01:10:30,874 --> 01:10:32,535
...September, 1870.

766
01:10:33,610 --> 01:10:35,771
The city I'd always dreamed of.

767
01:10:36,380 --> 01:10:40,544
I was Creole, after all, and Paris
was the mother of New Orleans.

768
01:10:41,218 --> 01:10:44,619
A universe whole and
entire unto herself.

769
01:11:19,489 --> 01:11:21,480
We were alive again.

770
01:11:21,658 --> 01:11:23,319
Just the two of us.

771
01:11:23,493 --> 01:11:27,827
And so euphoric was I that I
yielded to her every desire.

772
01:11:40,444 --> 01:11:41,934
So it was...

773
01:11:42,112 --> 01:11:45,104
...when I'd given up the
search for vampires...

774
01:11:45,282 --> 01:11:47,614
...that a vampire found me.

775
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:18,707
Buffoon!

776
01:13:20,277 --> 01:13:21,539
Santiago!

777
01:13:29,386 --> 01:13:33,948
I've searched the world for an
immortal and this is what I find!

778
01:13:50,073 --> 01:13:52,473
Bring the petite beauty with you.

779
01:13:53,810 --> 01:13:55,300
No one will harm you.

780
01:13:55,479 --> 01:13:56,912
I won't allow it.

781
01:13:59,649 --> 01:14:00,911
And...

782
01:14:01,251 --> 01:14:02,980
...remember my name:

783
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:06,149
Armand.

784
01:14:14,264 --> 01:14:16,095
Remember what I told you.

785
01:14:16,266 --> 01:14:20,168
They have different powers.
They'll read your thoughts.

786
01:14:32,949 --> 01:14:34,940
He's the one, that's the vampire.

787
01:14:36,686 --> 01:14:38,176
Two lovers...

788
01:14:38,355 --> 01:14:41,449
...wandering down their violet way...

789
01:14:42,292 --> 01:14:45,455
...whose passionate
embraces, each to each...

790
01:14:45,796 --> 01:14:49,197
...permits no meditations on decay...

791
01:14:51,301 --> 01:14:53,132
...until they find themselves...

792
01:14:53,303 --> 01:14:54,861
...within my reach!

793
01:15:01,378 --> 01:15:05,041
Vampires who pretend to be humans
pretending to be vampires.

794
01:15:05,215 --> 01:15:06,807
How avant-garde.

795
01:15:06,983 --> 01:15:10,384
The monk whose soul with
heaven doth commune...

796
01:15:11,321 --> 01:15:12,879
...and spends his days...

797
01:15:13,056 --> 01:15:15,547
...in pious contemplation...

798
01:15:17,994 --> 01:15:21,828
...finds he will meet
his Maker all too soon.

799
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:26,232
For all his prayers
gets no remuneration.

800
01:15:31,341 --> 01:15:33,241
The lesson endeth here...

801
01:15:33,677 --> 01:15:35,406
...and it is this:

802
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:40,012
Each one of you, my
clammy hands must touch.

803
01:15:41,585 --> 01:15:45,077
Each one must bend his
forehead to my kiss.

804
01:15:47,524 --> 01:15:48,855
But, hark!

805
01:15:49,426 --> 01:15:51,690
Methinks a mortal doth approach!

806
01:15:54,931 --> 01:15:56,865
What have we here?

807
01:15:57,601 --> 01:15:59,694
What beauty by my side?

808
01:16:00,937 --> 01:16:03,701
A rose in bloom, a shrinking violet?

809
01:16:05,442 --> 01:16:08,206
Perhaps she has a mind to be my bride.

810
01:16:08,712 --> 01:16:11,272
Perhaps my lesson has not ended yet!

811
01:16:13,617 --> 01:16:15,380
I don't want to die!

812
01:16:15,552 --> 01:16:18,112
But death we are and have always been.

813
01:16:18,288 --> 01:16:19,721
Someone help me!

814
01:16:19,956 --> 01:16:21,548
Please!

815
01:16:30,967 --> 01:16:33,561
- What have I done?!
- We all die!

816
01:16:33,970 --> 01:16:34,959
But I'm young!

817
01:16:35,138 --> 01:16:39,575
Death is no respecter of age!
It can come any time, any place.

818
01:16:53,156 --> 01:16:55,989
Just as this flesh is pink now...

819
01:16:56,326 --> 01:16:59,420
...so it will turn grey
and wrinkle with age.

820
01:16:59,596 --> 01:17:01,325
Let me live! I don't care!

821
01:17:01,498 --> 01:17:04,160
Then why should you care if you die now?

822
01:17:04,434 --> 01:17:08,268
And suppose death had a heart
to love and to release you?

823
01:17:08,772 --> 01:17:10,933
To whom would he turn his passion?

824
01:17:11,107 --> 01:17:13,940
Would you choose a person
from the crowd there?

825
01:17:14,110 --> 01:17:15,839
A person to suffer as you do?

826
01:17:16,012 --> 01:17:17,843
Monsieur Vampire, take me!

827
01:17:18,014 --> 01:17:19,948
I adore you!

828
01:17:20,450 --> 01:17:22,850
You wait your turn!

829
01:17:23,787 --> 01:17:25,277
Well...

830
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:30,024
Do you know what it means
to be loved by death?

831
01:17:31,628 --> 01:17:34,290
To become our bride?

832
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:35,680
No pain.

833
01:18:40,263 --> 01:18:41,753
No pain.

834
01:18:54,544 --> 01:18:55,943
Monstrous.

835
01:19:45,495 --> 01:19:47,258
We live beneath.

836
01:19:47,764 --> 01:19:49,322
Let me show you.

837
01:19:55,338 --> 01:19:56,930
Monstrous.

838
01:19:57,841 --> 01:19:59,274
Yes.

839
01:20:00,276 --> 01:20:02,176
And very beautiful.

840
01:20:23,466 --> 01:20:25,457
Welcome to my home.

841
01:20:40,483 --> 01:20:41,882
Try him.

842
01:21:04,574 --> 01:21:06,337
Two vampires...

843
01:21:07,343 --> 01:21:09,243
...from the New World...

844
01:21:10,079 --> 01:21:12,741
...come to guide us into the new era...

845
01:21:13,249 --> 01:21:15,410
...as all we love slowly rots...

846
01:21:16,753 --> 01:21:18,516
...and fades away.

847
01:21:19,355 --> 01:21:21,846
Are you the leader of this group?

848
01:21:22,358 --> 01:21:24,258
If there were a leader...

849
01:21:24,761 --> 01:21:26,422
...I would be the one.

850
01:21:26,529 --> 01:21:29,020
- So you have the answers?
- So you have questions?

851
01:21:32,101 --> 01:21:33,534
What are we?

852
01:21:35,705 --> 01:21:37,036
Nothing...

853
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:39,440
...if not vampires.

854
01:21:42,879 --> 01:21:44,779
Who made us what we are?

855
01:21:45,448 --> 01:21:47,382
Surely you know who made you?

856
01:21:47,550 --> 01:21:49,609
Yes, but the one who made him.

857
01:21:50,286 --> 01:21:51,446
The source...

858
01:21:51,621 --> 01:21:53,054
...of all this...

859
01:21:54,224 --> 01:21:55,282
...evil.

860
01:21:57,227 --> 01:21:58,455
I understand.

861
01:22:00,129 --> 01:22:02,120
I saw you in the theater.

862
01:22:03,733 --> 01:22:05,633
Your suffering...

863
01:22:07,403 --> 01:22:09,462
...your sympathy for that girl.

864
01:22:11,307 --> 01:22:12,638
You die...

865
01:22:13,076 --> 01:22:14,407
...when you kill.

866
01:22:15,478 --> 01:22:19,244
You feel you deserve to die
and you stint on nothing.

867
01:22:20,984 --> 01:22:22,975
But does that make you evil?

868
01:22:23,987 --> 01:22:27,821
Since you comprehend what you call
goodness, doesn't it make you...

869
01:22:27,991 --> 01:22:29,083
...good?

870
01:22:29,759 --> 01:22:31,488
Then there is nothing?

871
01:22:31,928 --> 01:22:33,589
Perhaps.

872
01:22:35,265 --> 01:22:36,926
But perhaps...

873
01:22:38,668 --> 01:22:40,158
...this...

874
01:22:40,603 --> 01:22:43,094
...is the only real evil left.

875
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,672
Then God does not exist?

876
01:22:47,010 --> 01:22:49,342
I know nothing of God.

877
01:22:50,346 --> 01:22:51,677
Or the devil.

878
01:22:52,181 --> 01:22:56,174
I have never seen a vision,
nor learned a secret...

879
01:22:56,352 --> 01:22:59,344
...that wouldn't damn or save my soul.

880
01:23:01,190 --> 01:23:02,680
As far as I know...

881
01:23:02,859 --> 01:23:05,020
...after 400 years...

882
01:23:05,795 --> 01:23:07,524
...I am the oldest...

883
01:23:07,797 --> 01:23:09,697
...living vampire...

884
01:23:09,866 --> 01:23:11,299
...in the world.

885
01:23:12,802 --> 01:23:15,293
Then it's as I always feared.

886
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:25,880
You fear too much.

887
01:23:28,217 --> 01:23:30,208
So much you make me feel...

888
01:23:35,558 --> 01:23:37,492
The one who made you...

889
01:23:38,061 --> 01:23:40,052
...should have told you this.

890
01:23:41,331 --> 01:23:44,164
The one who left the Old
World for the New...

891
01:23:44,334 --> 01:23:45,733
He knew nothing.

892
01:23:45,902 --> 01:23:47,563
Nor did he care.

893
01:23:47,737 --> 01:23:48,726
Knew?

894
01:23:48,905 --> 01:23:50,236
Come, beloved.

895
01:23:51,240 --> 01:23:53,333
It's time we were on our way.

896
01:23:53,576 --> 01:23:54,668
I'm hungry...

897
01:23:54,811 --> 01:23:56,369
...and the city awaits.

898
01:23:57,747 --> 01:24:00,341
The place was empty as we left.

899
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:02,346
Silent as the grave.

900
01:24:02,518 --> 01:24:06,010
And as we blundered through
it, again came the thought:

901
01:24:06,189 --> 01:24:08,350
"I have wronged Lestat.

902
01:24:08,524 --> 01:24:10,685
I have hated him for the wrong reasons."

903
01:24:10,860 --> 01:24:12,418
How did you wrong him?

904
01:24:14,697 --> 01:24:15,857
You said a name.

905
01:24:16,366 --> 01:24:18,926
Yes, a name I don't care to say again.

906
01:24:19,202 --> 01:24:21,102
There is but one crime...

907
01:24:21,270 --> 01:24:23,204
...among us vampires here.

908
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:27,932
It is the crime that means
death to any vampire:

909
01:24:29,612 --> 01:24:31,603
To kill your own kind.

910
01:24:35,718 --> 01:24:38,619
- Do you think I'd let them harm you?
- No, you would not.

911
01:24:39,122 --> 01:24:40,783
Danger holds you to me.

912
01:24:40,957 --> 01:24:42,390
Love holds you to me.

913
01:24:42,558 --> 01:24:44,116
- Love?
- Love.

914
01:24:44,293 --> 01:24:47,387
You would leave me for
Armand if he beckoned you.

915
01:24:48,131 --> 01:24:49,291
Never.

916
01:24:49,465 --> 01:24:52,901
He wants you as you want him.
He's been waiting for you.

917
01:24:53,069 --> 01:24:55,401
He wants you as a companion.

918
01:24:55,571 --> 01:24:57,471
He bides his time there.

919
01:24:57,807 --> 01:25:00,401
He finds it as dull
and lifeless as we do.

920
01:25:00,576 --> 01:25:01,406
Perhaps.

921
01:25:01,978 --> 01:25:05,971
Do you know what his soul said
to me without saying a word?

922
01:25:07,150 --> 01:25:09,084
"Let him go," he said.

923
01:25:09,652 --> 01:25:11,244
"Let him go."

924
01:25:13,156 --> 01:25:15,420
Is that what I should do?

925
01:25:16,592 --> 01:25:18,253
Let you go?

926
01:25:19,262 --> 01:25:20,661
My father...

927
01:25:20,830 --> 01:25:22,263
...my Louis...

928
01:25:22,432 --> 01:25:23,990
...who made me?

929
01:25:25,835 --> 01:25:27,666
It will be all right.

930
01:25:28,838 --> 01:25:30,772
You really believe that?

931
01:25:38,781 --> 01:25:39,839
The soldier...

932
01:25:40,016 --> 01:25:42,177
...on returning from the wars...

933
01:25:42,351 --> 01:25:46,014
...thinks victory has enured
him against sorrow...

934
01:25:46,355 --> 01:25:48,289
...till death comes by...

935
01:25:48,691 --> 01:25:50,682
...and chops him from his horse.

936
01:25:56,966 --> 01:25:58,797
I was waiting for you.

937
01:26:01,304 --> 01:26:02,703
Listen to me.

938
01:26:05,208 --> 01:26:07,642
Claudia is very dear to me.

939
01:26:07,977 --> 01:26:09,137
She's my daughter.

940
01:26:09,312 --> 01:26:10,802
Your lover.

941
01:26:11,647 --> 01:26:13,046
No, my beloved.

942
01:26:13,216 --> 01:26:14,649
My child.

943
01:26:16,152 --> 01:26:18,211
You say so. You're innocent.

944
01:26:19,322 --> 01:26:21,313
She's in danger, isn't she?

945
01:26:21,557 --> 01:26:22,717
She is.

946
01:26:22,892 --> 01:26:23,881
Why?

947
01:26:25,661 --> 01:26:27,993
I could give you reasons.

948
01:26:29,165 --> 01:26:31,065
Her silence.

949
01:26:31,901 --> 01:26:33,334
Her youth.

950
01:26:34,837 --> 01:26:37,499
It's forbidden to make one so young...

951
01:26:38,007 --> 01:26:39,907
...so helpless...

952
01:26:40,243 --> 01:26:42,507
...that cannot survive on its own.

953
01:26:42,678 --> 01:26:44,407
Then blame the one who made her.

954
01:26:44,580 --> 01:26:46,673
Did you kill this vampire
who made you both?

955
01:26:46,849 --> 01:26:48,476
Is that why you won't say his name?

956
01:26:48,551 --> 01:26:49,745
Santiago thinks you did.

957
01:26:50,586 --> 01:26:52,747
- We want no quarrel with him.
- It's already begun.

958
01:26:54,690 --> 01:26:56,351
If you want to save her...

959
01:26:56,526 --> 01:26:59,017
...send her away!
- Then I leave too.

960
01:27:05,768 --> 01:27:07,258
So soon?

961
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:12,938
Without any of those
answers you so longed for?

962
01:27:13,276 --> 01:27:14,368
There are none.

963
01:27:14,544 --> 01:27:16,774
But you asked the wrong questions.

964
01:27:32,562 --> 01:27:33,893
You know...

965
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:36,621
...how few vampires...

966
01:27:37,633 --> 01:27:40,295
...have the stamina for immortality?

967
01:27:42,238 --> 01:27:44,468
They perish of their own will.

968
01:27:48,978 --> 01:27:50,570
The world...

969
01:27:51,247 --> 01:27:52,737
...changes.

970
01:27:54,750 --> 01:27:56,308
We do not.

971
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:59,911
Therein lies the irony...

972
01:28:00,089 --> 01:28:02,148
...that finally kills us.

973
01:28:02,658 --> 01:28:06,094
I need you to make
contact with this age.

974
01:28:06,762 --> 01:28:07,751
Me?

975
01:28:08,598 --> 01:28:10,259
Don't you see?

976
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:13,591
I'm not the spirit of any age.

977
01:28:14,437 --> 01:28:16,428
I'm at odds with everything.

978
01:28:16,606 --> 01:28:18,437
I always have been.

979
01:28:19,942 --> 01:28:22,843
That is the very spirit of your age.

980
01:28:24,180 --> 01:28:25,670
The heart of it.

981
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:29,113
Your fall...

982
01:28:29,285 --> 01:28:31,116
...from grace...

983
01:28:31,287 --> 01:28:34,017
...has been the fall of a century.

984
01:28:35,124 --> 01:28:37,183
But the vampires in the theater?

985
01:28:39,028 --> 01:28:40,461
Decadent...

986
01:28:41,130 --> 01:28:42,620
...useless.

987
01:28:44,133 --> 01:28:46,363
They can't reflect anything.

988
01:28:47,036 --> 01:28:48,025
But...

989
01:28:48,471 --> 01:28:49,802
...you do.

990
01:28:52,041 --> 01:28:53,133
You reflect...

991
01:28:53,309 --> 01:28:54,970
...its broken heart.

992
01:29:07,556 --> 01:29:09,319
A vampire...

993
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:12,660
...with a human soul.

994
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:16,831
An immortal with a mortal's passion.

995
01:29:19,335 --> 01:29:20,563
You...

996
01:29:20,903 --> 01:29:22,234
...are...

997
01:29:23,739 --> 01:29:25,730
...beautiful, my friend.

998
01:29:28,077 --> 01:29:31,240
Lestat must have wept when he made you.

999
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:36,078
You knew Lestat?

1000
01:29:38,854 --> 01:29:40,185
Yes.

1001
01:29:41,424 --> 01:29:42,857
I knew him.

1002
01:29:44,694 --> 01:29:48,027
Knew him well enough not
to mourn his passing.

1003
01:29:50,766 --> 01:29:53,360
I felt a kind of peace at last.

1004
01:29:53,936 --> 01:29:58,430
I had found the teacher which Lestat
could never, I knew now, have been.

1005
01:29:59,208 --> 01:30:02,268
I knew knowledge would
never be withheld by Armand.

1006
01:30:02,545 --> 01:30:06,037
It would pass through him
as through a pane of glass.

1007
01:30:20,963 --> 01:30:22,260
Madeleine...

1008
01:30:23,199 --> 01:30:24,860
...Louis is shy.

1009
01:30:40,549 --> 01:30:41,777
Drink.

1010
01:30:43,385 --> 01:30:44,613
Do it.

1011
01:30:44,787 --> 01:30:47,881
Because I cannot do it.
I haven't the strength.

1012
01:30:48,057 --> 01:30:52,391
- You saw to that when you made me.
- You don't know what you ask!

1013
01:30:54,630 --> 01:30:55,392
I have.

1014
01:30:55,564 --> 01:30:58,897
You have found your new companion!
You will make me mine!

1015
01:30:59,802 --> 01:31:01,497
How do we seem to you?

1016
01:31:02,404 --> 01:31:04,133
Do you find us beautiful?

1017
01:31:04,640 --> 01:31:06,005
Magical?

1018
01:31:06,642 --> 01:31:11,511
Our white skin, our fierce eyes?
Do you know the thing you will become?

1019
01:31:11,914 --> 01:31:14,405
Your evil is that you cannot be evil!

1020
01:31:14,583 --> 01:31:17,245
And I shall suffer for it no longer!

1021
01:31:17,586 --> 01:31:20,020
Don't make me do this! I cannot!

1022
01:31:20,422 --> 01:31:22,083
Yet, you did it to me.

1023
01:31:22,591 --> 01:31:27,528
Snatching me from my mother's hands,
like two monsters in a fairy tale.

1024
01:31:28,164 --> 01:31:30,029
And now you weep!

1025
01:31:30,166 --> 01:31:32,760
You haven't tears enough
for what you did!

1026
01:31:33,335 --> 01:31:35,428
You give her to me, Louis!

1027
01:31:35,604 --> 01:31:38,095
Do this before you leave me!

1028
01:31:40,442 --> 01:31:41,534
Oh, God!

1029
01:31:42,278 --> 01:31:43,939
I love you still!

1030
01:31:44,613 --> 01:31:46,774
That's the torment of it!

1031
01:31:47,783 --> 01:31:49,683
Who'd care for me, my love...

1032
01:31:50,352 --> 01:31:53,287
...my dark angel when you are gone?

1033
01:32:00,062 --> 01:32:02,622
What do you think she is, Madeleine?

1034
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:05,633
A doll?

1035
01:32:08,571 --> 01:32:10,471
A child who cannot die.

1036
01:32:11,707 --> 01:32:13,698
And the child who did die?

1037
01:32:15,644 --> 01:32:17,134
My daughter.

1038
01:33:14,036 --> 01:33:15,526
What's happening to her?

1039
01:33:15,704 --> 01:33:17,194
She's dying.

1040
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:20,131
It happened to you too...

1041
01:33:20,442 --> 01:33:23,138
...only you were too young to remember.

1042
01:33:25,047 --> 01:33:26,878
But if she dies...

1043
01:33:27,883 --> 01:33:30,044
It's only mortal death.

1044
01:33:33,656 --> 01:33:36,056
Bear me no ill will, my love.

1045
01:33:38,894 --> 01:33:40,794
We are now even.

1046
01:33:41,964 --> 01:33:43,556
What do you mean?

1047
01:33:44,967 --> 01:33:48,300
What died in that room
was not that woman.

1048
01:33:51,974 --> 01:33:53,805
What has died is the...

1049
01:33:55,244 --> 01:33:57,235
...last breath in me...

1050
01:33:58,180 --> 01:33:59,977
...that was human.

1051
01:34:04,253 --> 01:34:05,982
Yes, Father.

1052
01:34:06,989 --> 01:34:08,923
At last we are even.

1053
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:17,331
It's time for justice, little one.

1054
01:34:34,116 --> 01:34:37,347
Get me Armand.
He wouldn't stand for this.

1055
01:34:37,519 --> 01:34:39,282
Death for the others.

1056
01:34:39,955 --> 01:34:41,286
For you...

1057
01:34:41,523 --> 01:34:43,787
...eternity in a box.

1058
01:34:45,027 --> 01:34:46,858
Walled in a dungeon.

1059
01:34:47,029 --> 01:34:49,463
Your only company will be your screams.

1060
01:34:50,532 --> 01:34:52,796
Perhaps it will take centuries.

1061
01:34:54,470 --> 01:34:55,528
Take them!

1062
01:36:10,712 --> 01:36:12,612
Pleasant dreams.

1063
01:36:14,883 --> 01:36:16,817
No! No!

1064
01:36:17,886 --> 01:36:19,319
Help!

1065
01:36:55,157 --> 01:36:56,351
Wake up!

1066
01:38:03,425 --> 01:38:04,722
Where's Claudia?

1067
01:38:05,561 --> 01:38:08,155
Claudia. I cannot help her.

1068
01:38:08,664 --> 01:38:11,155
- Where's Claudia?
- I can't save her!

1069
01:38:13,168 --> 01:38:15,227
I will only risk losing you!

1070
01:38:17,439 --> 01:38:18,667
Don't!

1071
01:40:06,448 --> 01:40:07,779
Come, Louis.

1072
01:40:09,184 --> 01:40:10,549
Not here.

1073
01:40:19,061 --> 01:40:21,325
So a vampire can cry?

1074
01:40:23,565 --> 01:40:24,725
Once...

1075
01:40:25,067 --> 01:40:26,830
...maybe twice, in eternity.

1076
01:40:29,004 --> 01:40:33,373
And maybe it was to quench tears
forever that I took revenge.

1077
01:41:29,798 --> 01:41:32,392
Stop him! It's burning!

1078
01:41:32,567 --> 01:41:34,125
Get him! Stop him!

1079
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:42,025
You didn't even warn them, did you?

1080
01:43:44,032 --> 01:43:45,090
No.

1081
01:43:47,269 --> 01:43:49,533
And you knew what I would do.

1082
01:43:50,772 --> 01:43:52,103
I knew.

1083
01:43:52,541 --> 01:43:54,532
I rescued you, didn't I?

1084
01:43:54,709 --> 01:43:56,609
From the terrible dawn.

1085
01:44:00,949 --> 01:44:03,611
You were their leader.
They trusted you.

1086
01:44:03,785 --> 01:44:04,774
No.

1087
01:44:05,887 --> 01:44:08,378
You made me see their failings, Louis.

1088
01:44:09,891 --> 01:44:11,222
They were...

1089
01:44:11,393 --> 01:44:14,226
...doomed, stuck in their decadent time.

1090
01:44:15,063 --> 01:44:17,623
They had forgotten the first lesson...

1091
01:44:17,899 --> 01:44:19,958
...that we must be powerful...

1092
01:44:20,135 --> 01:44:21,397
...beautiful...

1093
01:44:21,570 --> 01:44:23,299
...and without regret.

1094
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:25,797
You can teach me this?

1095
01:44:25,974 --> 01:44:27,407
Yes.

1096
01:44:27,642 --> 01:44:29,633
To be without regret?

1097
01:44:31,813 --> 01:44:34,077
Then what a pair we could make.

1098
01:44:36,818 --> 01:44:39,981
But what if it's a lesson
I don't care to learn?

1099
01:44:41,590 --> 01:44:42,579
What?

1100
01:44:42,991 --> 01:44:45,653
What if all I have is my suffering?

1101
01:44:45,927 --> 01:44:47,758
My regret?

1102
01:44:49,431 --> 01:44:51,331
Don't you want to lose it?

1103
01:44:51,499 --> 01:44:53,490
So you can have that too?

1104
01:44:54,336 --> 01:44:56,429
The heart that mourns her...

1105
01:44:56,938 --> 01:44:59,099
...whom you burnt to a cinder?

1106
01:44:59,274 --> 01:45:00,832
I swear I didn't...

1107
01:45:01,009 --> 01:45:02,601
But I know you did.

1108
01:45:03,511 --> 01:45:04,773
I know...

1109
01:45:06,281 --> 01:45:07,441
...you...

1110
01:45:08,116 --> 01:45:09,845
...regret nothing.

1111
01:45:11,786 --> 01:45:13,344
You feel...

1112
01:45:13,955 --> 01:45:15,115
...nothing.

1113
01:45:17,125 --> 01:45:19,685
If that's all I have left to learn...

1114
01:45:21,296 --> 01:45:23,287
...I can do that on my own.

1115
01:45:33,708 --> 01:45:35,039
I will die.

1116
01:45:35,210 --> 01:45:35,869
No.

1117
01:45:36,044 --> 01:45:37,477
You are dead.

1118
01:45:37,646 --> 01:45:40,376
And you want me to
quicken you once more.

1119
01:45:42,717 --> 01:45:46,312
And as much as your invitation
might appeal to me...

1120
01:45:47,722 --> 01:45:49,553
...I must regretfully...

1121
01:45:49,891 --> 01:45:50,880
...decline.

1122
01:46:03,905 --> 01:46:05,998
For years I wandered:

1123
01:46:06,174 --> 01:46:07,903
Italy, Greece...

1124
01:46:08,510 --> 01:46:10,569
...all the ancient lands.

1125
01:46:10,912 --> 01:46:13,346
But the world was a tomb to me...

1126
01:46:13,515 --> 01:46:16,177
...a graveyard full of broken statues.

1127
01:46:16,918 --> 01:46:20,513
And each of those statues
resembled her face.

1128
01:46:26,428 --> 01:46:28,191
Then, out of curiosity...

1129
01:46:28,363 --> 01:46:30,194
...boredom, who knows what...

1130
01:46:30,532 --> 01:46:32,022
...I left the Old World...

1131
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:34,430
...and came back to my America.

1132
01:46:37,605 --> 01:46:41,871
And there a mechanical wonder
allowed me to see the sunrise...

1133
01:46:42,043 --> 01:46:43,874
...for the first time...

1134
01:46:44,045 --> 01:46:45,876
...in 200 years.

1135
01:46:47,115 --> 01:46:48,878
And what sunrises!

1136
01:46:49,551 --> 01:46:52,452
Seen as the human eye
could never see them.

1137
01:46:53,288 --> 01:46:55,051
Silver at first...

1138
01:46:55,790 --> 01:46:58,884
...then, as the years progressed,
in tones of purple...

1139
01:46:59,060 --> 01:47:00,220
...red...

1140
01:47:00,395 --> 01:47:02,795
...and my long-lost blue.

1141
01:47:07,469 --> 01:47:10,802
In the spring of 1988, I
returned to New Orleans.

1142
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:15,301
And as soon as I smelled
the air, I knew I was home.

1143
01:47:16,478 --> 01:47:17,809
It was rich...

1144
01:47:17,979 --> 01:47:19,640
...almost sweet...

1145
01:47:19,814 --> 01:47:23,978
...like the fragrance of jasmine
and roses around our old courtyard.

1146
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:29,814
I walked the streets savoring
that long-lost perfume.

1147
01:47:35,163 --> 01:47:37,256
And then on Prytania Street...

1148
01:47:37,432 --> 01:47:40,492
...only blocks from the
Lafayette cemetery...

1149
01:47:40,668 --> 01:47:42,829
...I caught the scent of death.

1150
01:47:43,438 --> 01:47:45,929
And it wasn't coming from the graves.

1151
01:47:47,509 --> 01:47:50,273
The scent grew stronger as I walked.

1152
01:47:50,445 --> 01:47:52,003
Old death.

1153
01:47:52,347 --> 01:47:55,009
A scent too faint for mortals to detect.

1154
01:49:27,141 --> 01:49:29,405
I'm so glad you are here!

1155
01:49:30,078 --> 01:49:31,636
I've dreamed...

1156
01:49:32,480 --> 01:49:34,311
...of this moment.

1157
01:49:35,917 --> 01:49:38,317
She never should have been one of...

1158
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:40,319
...us.

1159
01:49:40,655 --> 01:49:42,646
That's all past, Lestat.

1160
01:49:47,262 --> 01:49:48,752
Past.

1161
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:14,281
Still beautiful, Louis.

1162
01:50:16,958 --> 01:50:19,449
You always were the strong one.

1163
01:50:23,631 --> 01:50:25,292
Don't be frightened.

1164
01:50:29,370 --> 01:50:31,304
I mean you no harm.

1165
01:50:34,976 --> 01:50:37,035
You've come home to me then?

1166
01:50:41,549 --> 01:50:43,983
You remember how I was?

1167
01:50:45,987 --> 01:50:47,648
The vampire...

1168
01:50:47,822 --> 01:50:49,653
...that I was?

1169
01:50:50,725 --> 01:50:52,386
Yes, I remember.

1170
01:50:58,833 --> 01:50:59,993
No one...

1171
01:51:00,168 --> 01:51:01,897
...could refuse me...

1172
01:51:03,404 --> 01:51:04,837
...not even you.

1173
01:51:06,407 --> 01:51:07,840
I tried.

1174
01:51:08,509 --> 01:51:10,340
Yes, you tried.

1175
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:13,670
And the more you tried...

1176
01:51:17,852 --> 01:51:19,752
...the more I wanted you.

1177
01:51:30,098 --> 01:51:31,861
I can't bear it.

1178
01:51:34,268 --> 01:51:35,701
Such lights...

1179
01:51:37,271 --> 01:51:38,932
...and that noise!

1180
01:51:40,541 --> 01:51:43,533
They make the night
brighter than the day.

1181
01:51:51,886 --> 01:51:53,786
It's false light.

1182
01:51:54,055 --> 01:51:55,784
It can't harm you.

1183
01:52:07,068 --> 01:52:09,628
If you stay with me, Louis...

1184
01:52:11,072 --> 01:52:12,903
...I could venture out again.

1185
01:52:15,977 --> 01:52:18,070
Become the old Lestat.

1186
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:21,411
I must leave now.

1187
01:52:49,510 --> 01:52:52,172
Whatever happened to
Lestat, I do not know.

1188
01:52:53,514 --> 01:52:54,947
I go on...

1189
01:52:55,116 --> 01:52:56,845
...night after night.

1190
01:52:57,018 --> 01:52:59,509
I feed on those who cross my path.

1191
01:53:02,190 --> 01:53:05,455
But all my passion went
with her golden hair.

1192
01:53:08,529 --> 01:53:11,521
I'm a spirit of preternatural flesh.

1193
01:53:12,700 --> 01:53:14,361
Detached.

1194
01:53:15,203 --> 01:53:16,534
Unchangeable.

1195
01:53:19,474 --> 01:53:20,702
Empty.

1196
01:53:21,809 --> 01:53:22,969
Empty?

1197
01:53:23,478 --> 01:53:24,638
That's it?

1198
01:53:26,881 --> 01:53:28,815
No, it can't end like that.

1199
01:53:30,384 --> 01:53:31,874
But it has.

1200
01:53:32,053 --> 01:53:33,816
There's no more to tell.

1201
01:53:34,722 --> 01:53:39,489
There must be more to tell. You don't
understand yourself. You're not empty.

1202
01:53:40,161 --> 01:53:43,324
What I wouldn't give to be like
you, to have your power...

1203
01:53:43,498 --> 01:53:45,830
...to see the things you have seen.

1204
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,331
You weren't listening.

1205
01:53:47,502 --> 01:53:50,335
I have been listening.
Your story is incredible.

1206
01:53:50,505 --> 01:53:52,166
- It's amazing.
- Do what you want with it.

1207
01:53:52,340 --> 01:53:54,501
Give it to others. Learn what you can.

1208
01:53:55,343 --> 01:53:59,006
There's only one way I'll
truly learn and you know it.

1209
01:53:59,247 --> 01:54:01,841
You brought me here for a reason.

1210
01:54:02,083 --> 01:54:03,072
Didn't you?

1211
01:54:03,251 --> 01:54:05,014
What reason would that be?

1212
01:54:05,186 --> 01:54:09,179
You want a companion. You want a link
to the outside world. That's me.

1213
01:54:09,357 --> 01:54:11,917
Take me. That's what I want.

1214
01:54:12,093 --> 01:54:15,426
- I refuse to let it end like this.
- God, I've failed again.

1215
01:54:15,596 --> 01:54:18,588
You haven't failed.
God has nothing to do with it.

1216
01:54:21,702 --> 01:54:22,862
Like this?

1217
01:54:23,938 --> 01:54:26,873
Do you like being food
for the immortals?

1218
01:54:27,608 --> 01:54:28,870
Do you like dying?

1219
01:54:29,043 --> 01:54:30,101
Stop!

1220
01:55:37,845 --> 01:55:40,439
1791 was the year it happened.

1221
01:55:40,615 --> 01:55:43,846
I was 24. Younger than you are now.

1222
01:55:44,685 --> 01:55:47,677
But times were different then.
I was a man at that age.

1223
01:55:47,855 --> 01:55:51,450
The master of a large plantation,
just south of New Orleans.

1224
01:55:52,693 --> 01:55:55,287
I had lost my wife in childbirth.

1225
01:55:55,463 --> 01:55:57,124
Someone change my shorts.

1226
01:55:57,298 --> 01:56:00,290
She and the infant had been
buried less than half a year.

1227
01:56:00,468 --> 01:56:01,332
It's good stuff.

1228
01:56:01,502 --> 01:56:02,730
I would have been happy
to join her.

1229
01:56:02,803 --> 01:56:04,532
Good stuff.

1230
01:56:08,042 --> 01:56:10,306
I assume I need no introduction.

1231
01:56:24,825 --> 01:56:26,816
I feel better already.

1232
01:56:31,065 --> 01:56:33,898
Most of all, I longed for death.

1233
01:56:34,502 --> 01:56:36,060
I invited it.

1234
01:56:37,171 --> 01:56:39,731
A release from the pain of living.

1235
01:56:43,177 --> 01:56:44,906
Still whining.

1236
01:56:47,581 --> 01:56:49,071
Heard enough?

1237
01:56:49,417 --> 01:56:51,851
I had to listen to that for centuries.

1238
01:56:54,588 --> 01:56:55,680
Don't be afraid.

1239
01:56:58,426 --> 01:57:00,860
I'm going to give you the choice...

1240
01:57:01,762 --> 01:57:03,525
...I never had.
