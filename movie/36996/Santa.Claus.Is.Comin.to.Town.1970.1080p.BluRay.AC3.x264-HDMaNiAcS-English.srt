1
00:00:05,004 --> 00:00:07,005
Today, children everywhere

2
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,007
are making preparations for an event

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,009
of world-shaking significance…

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,013
The annual visit of Santa Claus.

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:18,016
Informed sources report
legions of junior citizens

6
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,020
are making monumental efforts not to cry

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,021
and not to pout.

8
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,023
Meanwhile, letters by the thousands

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,025
have been flooding postal facilities

10
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,028
at the North Pole.

11
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:37,035
Doggone thing always conks out when you…

12
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,037
Well, hello there!

13
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,039
My name's special delivery Kloogle…

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,041
S.D. for short.

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,044
Oh, I've got lots of
letters for Santa today,

16
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,046
and every year, they're the same.

17
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:52,050
Some ask for toys, but a lot ask questions.

18
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,053
Like, you take this one. I
bet one of you wrote it.

19
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,055
"Dear Santa, why
do you wear a red suit?"

20
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,058
Uh-huh. I thought so. And this one…

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,060
My turn. "Dear Santa,

22
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,062
"why do you comedown the chimney

23
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,063
when I'm asleep?"

24
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,064
How about these?

25
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,066
Why do you have whiskers?

26
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,068
Why do you live at the North Pole?

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,069
Why do you leave presents?

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,271
Why do you always come

29
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,472
on Christmas Eve?

30
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,674
Why do some people
call you Kris Kringle?

31
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,076
Why? Why?

32
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,077
Now, hold on, hold on!

33
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,079
I can answer all your questions

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,081
because I know everything about Santa.

35
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:25,884
Now, Santa is a busy man.

36
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,087
He has no time to play.

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,091
He's got millions and millions of stockings

38
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,093
to fill on Christmas day.

39
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,094
So you'd better write your letter now

40
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,097
and mail it right away,

41
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,099
because he's getting ready

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,102
with his reindeers and his sleigh.

43
00:01:44,103 --> 00:01:46,104
<i>♪ So… you better watch out ♪</i>

44
00:01:46,105 --> 00:01:47,107
<i>♪ You better not cry ♪</i>

45
00:01:48,107 --> 00:01:49,107
<i>♪ You better not pout ♪</i>

46
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:51,110
<i>♪ I'm telling you why ♪</i>

47
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,707
So you want to know all about Santa, eh?

48
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,908
Best place to start is
at the very beginning,

49
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,810
when Santa was just a little baby.

50
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,212
You mean, Santa was once…

51
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,214
A baby?

52
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,216
Of course. Everybody's got to be a baby

53
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,418
at least once in their lives.

54
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,220
Now, this was years and years ago…

55
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,722
Oh, way back.

56
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,224
In one of the northern countries,

57
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,227
there was a small city called Sombertown.

58
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:52,230
It was a cold, cold place
which shivered in the shadows

59
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,233
of the strange Mountain
of the Whispering Winds.

60
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,039
Now, the main reason for all this gloom

61
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,840
was the mayor… a mean
old grouch of a fellow

62
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,043
who was known as
Burgermeister Meisterburger.

63
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,846
Herr Burgermeister! Herr Burgermeister!

64
00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,749
Look what was discovered
on your front stoop!

65
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,951
What? What, Grimsly?

66
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,252
The milk? The daily paper?

67
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,555
No, sir… a baby!

68
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,257
Oh, is that all?

69
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,260
A baby?!

70
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,262
And there's a note.

71
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,765
"Please, sir, take care of my child,

72
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,267
and protect him from the dangers

73
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,970
of the Mountain of the Whispering Winds.

74
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,772
He will be exceptional

75
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,275
if only given the love he needs."

76
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,278
I, Burgermeister Meisterburger,

77
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,279
take care of a baby?

78
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,282
Outrageous! What's its name?

79
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,284
This is the only clue, sir.

80
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:49,287
It says, "Claus."

81
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,292
Oh, take the little baggage to the orphan
asylum.

82
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,795
That's the proper place
for foundlings, anyway.

83
00:04:59,298 --> 00:05:02,300
Get that brat out of here!

84
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:17,315
Oh! The sleigh… it broke away!

85
00:05:17,316 --> 00:05:19,317
Oh, my goodness!

86
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,319
Where are you, baby Claus?

87
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,322
Oh, do come back! Come back!

88
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,825
Well, that strange
wind blew the little sleigh

89
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,329
right up to the Mountain
of the Whispering Winds.

90
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,337
For, you see, that Mountain was the home

91
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,340
of the awful, the terrible…

92
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,343
Oh, I hate to even say his name!

93
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,345
That Mountain was the home of the…

94
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:51,349
Winter Warlock…

95
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,352
The strange hermit of the north

96
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,356
who lived alone in a ghostly palace of ice,

97
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,560
practicing his strange spells
and snowy incantations.

98
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:08,067
The animals knew they had to
hide that baby, and fast.

99
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,371
They knew where that baby belonged,

100
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,874
so, quick as they could,
they started on their way.

101
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,077
Where? Where?

102
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,477
Well, you see,

103
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,579
just beyond the Mountain
was Rainbow River Valley,

104
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,383
and there, by a bend in the magical stream,

105
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,887
was the home of a jolly
family of little people…

106
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,289
Elves, you might call them.

107
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,991
Kringle was their name.

108
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,394
The door was answered by
an elf named Dingle…

109
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,696
Dingle Kringle, to be precise.

110
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,397
Yes? Who's there?

111
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,399
There's who? Ooh!

112
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,402
Wiggle my ears and tickle my toes!

113
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,605
Methinks I see a baby's nose!

114
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,907
It's more than a nose.

115
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,309
There's a whole baby attached to it!

116
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,111
Better call my brothers.

117
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,812
Wingle! Bingle!

118
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,614
Tingle! Zingle!

119
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,215
What is it, Dingle?

120
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,417
It's a baby, Zingle.

121
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,919
A baby what, Wingle?

122
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,222
A baby baby, Tingle.

123
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,524
I like babies, Bingle.

124
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,928
Our baby's the best baby
of them all, Wingle.

125
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,030
They brought the little fella

126
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,232
to the elf queen, Tanta Kringle.

127
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,035
A baby! What a splendid idea!

128
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,238
He shall live with us and sleep with us

129
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,340
and drink warm cocoa with us.

130
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,844
What will we call him, Tanta Kringle?

131
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,447
His license says, "Claus."

132
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,848
Unusual name.

133
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,451
However, we shall call him Kris…

134
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,953
Kris Kringle.

135
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,455
Well, those little Kringles

136
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,657
took that baby to their hearts.

137
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,560
Soon as he was old enough,
they set up a little school

138
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,762
and taught him all the important things…

139
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,165
How to read and write and talk

140
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,167
and count stars on a crystal night,

141
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,769
and how to make toys.

142
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,970
Make toys?

143
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,572
Oh, sure.

144
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,874
That was the Kringles' main occupation.

145
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,476
They were toymakers.

146
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,178
The only problem

147
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,480
was there were no
children to give them to.

148
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,783
You remember, Sombertown
was on the other side

149
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,985
of the Mountain of the Whispering Winds,

150
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,787
and the little elves just couldn't make it

151
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,389
past the Winter Warlock.

152
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,292
So…

153
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,994
The toys kind of stacked up some.

154
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,196
It's really quite sad.

155
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,798
We will never be able

156
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,901
to transport our toys

157
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,001
over the mountain.

158
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,603
Someday, when I am bigger,

159
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,905
I'll take them for you, Tanta Kringle.

160
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,008
Oh, that will be the day!

161
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:31,311
We will be great toymakers
again, as we once were.

162
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,612
When was that, Tanta?

163
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,315
Oh, years and years ago.

164
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,517
The Kringles were world-renowned,

165
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:41,421
for, you know, we were the
very first royal toymakers…

166
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,725
The first toymakers to the King.

195
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:39,639
So that's why he makes

196
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,840
such wonderful toys.

197
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,142
That's why.

198
00:10:42,443 --> 00:10:44,444
The Kringles taught him
everything they knew.

199
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:46,447
Of course, Kris had other teachers…

200
00:10:46,948 --> 00:10:48,049
The animals.

201
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,356
But the seals taught him the
most important things…

202
00:10:56,557 --> 00:10:57,557
How to have fun and…

203
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,959
Ho ho ho ho!

204
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,163
Ho ho ho ho!

205
00:11:03,364 --> 00:11:04,364
How to laugh…

206
00:11:04,665 --> 00:11:07,167
Real hard and wonderful, like he meant it.

207
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,069
Ho ho ho ho!

208
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,270
Well, years went by,

209
00:11:10,471 --> 00:11:12,272
and finally, Kris was a fine young man.

210
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:14,474
I'm a man now, Tanta.

211
00:11:14,475 --> 00:11:15,475
I can take those toys

212
00:11:15,476 --> 00:11:18,478
across the Mountain of
the Whispering Winds.

213
00:11:18,479 --> 00:11:19,979
It would be nice

214
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,382
if someone played with our toys.

215
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:26,586
If only one of my dollies
could be held tight

216
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:27,788
by a little girl.

217
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:29,489
It's decided, then.

218
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:32,692
Tomorrow, I leave for Sombertown.

219
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,697
Tanta Kringle?

220
00:11:38,698 --> 00:11:40,699
Ah, I was just packing.

221
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,801
Did I wake you up?

222
00:11:42,002 --> 00:11:45,004
I was awake anyhow. I
made this for your trip.

223
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,708
A real Kringle suit!

224
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,209
So that's where

225
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,311
he got the red suit.

226
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,514
Yep, and he's
always worn one just like it,

227
00:11:54,715 --> 00:11:55,717
right to this day.

228
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,219
Well, Kris said good-bye
to all his friends…

229
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,820
Elf and animal.

230
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,023
Just as night was falling,

231
00:12:03,324 --> 00:12:06,026
Kris started to make his way
through the dismal forest

232
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:08,328
which lay at the foot of
the Warlock's Mountain.

233
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:09,730
Hey!

234
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:14,334
Why… why, you're a penguin.

235
00:12:15,536 --> 00:12:18,538
Well, what is a penguin doing here?

236
00:12:20,241 --> 00:12:21,542
You're looking for a stick?

237
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:22,642
A branch?

238
00:12:22,743 --> 00:12:24,744
A log? A pole?

239
00:12:25,946 --> 00:12:27,447
The North Pole?

240
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:29,649
No? The South Pole!

241
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:31,951
Well, little feller,

242
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,553
that's on the other end of the Earth.

243
00:12:33,754 --> 00:12:35,755
You're just about as lost as you could get.

244
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,257
You better travel with me.

245
00:12:37,658 --> 00:12:38,959
You need someone to take care of you.

246
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,161
Now, cut that out.

247
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:43,363
Come on, uh, Topper.

248
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,966
I'll call you Topper.

249
00:12:46,267 --> 00:12:47,967
Ok?

250
00:12:48,068 --> 00:12:50,070
Come on. This way, little feller.

251
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:55,777
Who nears my mountain?

252
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:58,879
Go back…

253
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:03,583
Or you are doomed!

254
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,385
Come on, Topper!

255
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:16,897
I shall get him when he returns.

256
00:13:17,298 --> 00:13:20,900
He's got to cross my
mountain on the way home,

257
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,303
and then…

258
00:13:24,404 --> 00:13:27,608
No more being the nice guy.

259
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,511
We made it, Topper.

260
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:34,013
And…

261
00:13:34,214 --> 00:13:36,215
And look! Sombertown…

262
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,518
Just sitting there waiting for us

263
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:40,820
and our good Kringle toys!

264
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,522
That's what they thought.

265
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:45,525
But what they didn't realize
was at that very moment

266
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,227
in the Sombertown City Hall…

267
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:48,828
His honor…

268
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:53,134
Burgermeister Meisterburger.

269
00:14:04,244 --> 00:14:05,445
As I suspected…

270
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:07,747
You've broken your funny bone.

271
00:14:08,048 --> 00:14:09,048
Ohh…

272
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:11,350
What caused me to trip, Grimsly?

273
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,152
This, sir.

274
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,855
Hmm? A toy?

275
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:17,857
As I suspected.

276
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:22,161
I hate toys, and toys hate me.

277
00:14:22,462 --> 00:14:24,464
Either they are going or I am going,

278
00:14:24,865 --> 00:14:27,867
and I am certainly not going, Grimsly.

279
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:31,171
I have a job for you to
do. Now, take this down.

Give me all your toys,

312
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,008
by order of the Burgermeister.

313
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:54,813
We'll never play again.

314
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,415
Ho ho ho ho ho!

315
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,618
The townspeople didn't
know what to make of Kris.

316
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:02,020
Hi there. Ha ha.

317
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,022
Nice day, friend.

318
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,023
Don't "Hi" me.

319
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:06,024
Good morning, ma'am.

320
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,027
You ought to be ashamed
of yourself, young man,

321
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,029
wearing such outlandish clothes.

322
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,031
Clothes?

323
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:16,635
Look, all I want to do
is give away these toys.

324
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,736
Toys?!

325
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:18,837
Toys?!

326
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:22,040
Oh! Get him out of here!

327
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,346
What did I say?

328
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,350
Well, what's going on here?

329
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,552
We're doing our chores.

330
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,054
Yeah, and no more playing.

331
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,057
No playing, eh?

332
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:41,060
Are you washing out… stockings?

333
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,763
Uh-huh. It's one of our daily duties.

334
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:47,065
Then we hang them by the fireplace

335
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,367
so they dry overnight.

336
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,669
That's the only way they
judge you around here…

337
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,371
By how many chores you do

338
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,473
and how clean your stockings are.

339
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:55,574
Is that so?

340
00:17:56,075 --> 00:18:00,078
Well, uh, you don't have
to look so glum about it.

341
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,080
Why?

342
00:18:01,481 --> 00:18:03,482
I don't know. I just don't like sour faces.

343
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,084
Now, I got some real nice goodies for you,

344
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,087
but not if you look like this.

345
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,790
You better watch out. Better not cry.

346
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:13,091
Better not pout.

347
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,092
Why?

348
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,694
I'm telling you why!

349
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,095
Yeah?

350
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,098
'Cause I came to town,
and look what I brought.

351
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,099
Toys!

352
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,101
Real toys!

353
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,103
Why, sure…

354
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:27,105
Compliments of the Kringles.

355
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,108
But… but what about the Burgermeister?

356
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,109
What about him?

357
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,111
If he wants a toy, he may have one.

358
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:35,113
I'll save him a big red yo-yo.

359
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,118
Come on. Let's play!

360
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,119
Yeah! Come on!

361
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Wait!

362
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,823
You must not play with toys.

363
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,825
And, uh, who are you?

364
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,127
That's miss Jessica, our new schoolteacher.

365
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:52,130
Kris Kringle at your service, Miss Jessica.

366
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,632
How dare you come here

367
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,333
in those ridiculous clothes

368
00:18:55,434 --> 00:18:56,535
and make fun of me?

369
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:59,037
Clothes again? I wasn't making…

370
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,439
And what do you mean

371
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,140
by giving the children toys?

372
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,144
Don't you know toys are against the law?

373
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:05,844
- What?

374
00:19:06,045 --> 00:19:07,046
- Yep. It's true.

375
00:19:07,847 --> 00:19:09,848
Gee. That's kind of a silly law.

376
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,149
If the Burgermeister saw you,

377
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,152
we would all be in great danger.

378
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:16,155
In danger from toys?

379
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,758
Why, that's the silliest
thing I ever heard.

380
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,161
Toys are frivolous, impractical,

381
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,165
unproductive, and…

382
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:26,965
What's that?

383
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:28,068
For you.

384
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:29,768
A China doll?

385
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,172
I always wanted one when
I was a little girl,

386
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,774
but my parents wouldn't…

387
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,177
Oh! Thank you.

388
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,678
I mean…

389
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,079
Watch out for that Dolly.

390
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,382
She's a hardened criminal, I hear.

391
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,886
Well, maybe it is a silly law.

392
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:47,686
I mean…

393
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,190
What do you say you help me
hand out these presents, huh?

394
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,492
It's too big a job for
one oversized Kringle

395
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,394
and a little lost penguin.

Ah, a perfect day.

435
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,296
Everybody is glum.

436
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:42,300
Ah, see? All the little children
are playing with their toys.

437
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:45,904
Playing with their toys?!

438
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,308
Stop… in the name of the law!

439
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,310
You brats are under arrest!

440
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,812
Take them away.

441
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:56,314
Don't arrest those children!

442
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:57,716
It was my fault.

443
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,818
I gave them the toys.

444
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,821
You?! How dare you?

445
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,825
You are obviously a
nonconformist and a rebel!

446
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,827
Me? Rebel?

447
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,330
Arrest this man immediately.

448
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,331
For you.

449
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:17,335
A yo-yo?

450
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,338
I love yo-yos!

451
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,042
I used to be able to do
all kinds of tricks.

452
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,344
Whee! Hoo hoo hoo!

453
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,346
Hee hee! Hoo hoo hoo!

454
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,347
Excuse me, sir,

455
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,350
but you're breaking your own laws.

456
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,752
What? What are you saying? What?

457
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:35,353
Ooh…

458
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,956
Ooh! Ooh, I have been bamboozled!

459
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:39,357
Arrest him!

460
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,760
Arrest him!

461
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,365
Oh, look!
He climbs like a squirrel,

462
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,367
leaps like a deer,

463
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:51,369
and is as slippery as a seal.

464
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,673
After him!

465
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,378
He went into the woods!

466
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:03,282
We'll never find him in there.

467
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,385
I guess we lost 'em, Topper.

468
00:23:06,886 --> 00:23:08,887
Slow down, now.

469
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,391
Ooh-whee!

470
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,491
Wonder where we are.

471
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,394
"You are trespassing

472
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:20,398
on the lands of the Winter Warlock."

473
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:22,701
Hey! Hey, let go!

474
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,404
Let go!

475
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,407
Kris Kringle…

476
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:33,011
You've disturbed me
for the very last time.

477
00:23:33,812 --> 00:23:35,614
Now I have you…

478
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,417
And you'll never get away!

479
00:23:51,528 --> 00:23:54,529
Look, uh, before you do me in,

480
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:55,831
would you tell your tree friends

481
00:23:55,932 --> 00:23:57,233
to let me loose for a second?

482
00:23:57,434 --> 00:23:59,536
You see, I have something for you.

483
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:02,638
What is this, a trick?

484
00:24:02,739 --> 00:24:04,740
Oh, oh, no, sir, Mr. Warlock,

485
00:24:04,741 --> 00:24:07,743
or may I call you "Winter"?

486
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:10,746
Mr. Warlock, if you please!

487
00:24:10,747 --> 00:24:13,749
Oh. Well, I managed to
save one little toy…

488
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,751
And I'd like you to have it.

489
00:24:15,752 --> 00:24:17,753
You…

490
00:24:17,754 --> 00:24:20,756
You wish to give me…

491
00:24:20,757 --> 00:24:22,758
A present?

492
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:24,760
A… A toy?

493
00:24:24,761 --> 00:24:25,763
Yes, sir.

494
00:24:26,763 --> 00:24:28,764
But… nobody ever gives

495
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:31,767
mean old Warlock… a toy.

496
00:24:31,768 --> 00:24:33,769
I'd like to start a new custom.

497
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,771
If you'd just call off…

498
00:24:35,772 --> 00:24:37,773
Wha… what? Oh, oh, yeah.

499
00:24:37,774 --> 00:24:38,776
Uh, heh heh heh!

500
00:24:39,776 --> 00:24:41,777
Oh, yes, of course.

501
00:24:41,778 --> 00:24:44,780
But you mustn't mind the tree monsters.

502
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:46,783
Their bark is worse than their bite.

503
00:24:47,784 --> 00:24:48,784
Ha ha ha!

504
00:24:48,785 --> 00:24:50,787
"Their bark is worse than their bite."

505
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:52,788
Ha ha ha!

506
00:24:52,789 --> 00:24:53,791
Hey, uh, Willie Willow,

507
00:24:54,791 --> 00:24:55,791
Peter Pine,

508
00:24:55,792 --> 00:24:58,794
release the Kringle, hmm?

509
00:24:58,795 --> 00:24:59,797
Yeah.

510
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:01,697
And no tricks, now.

511
00:25:01,798 --> 00:25:03,802
Oh, oh, no. No, sir, Mr. Warlock.

512
00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:06,803
A choo-choo.

513
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,208
I've always wanted one.

514
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:13,310
What's that?

515
00:25:13,811 --> 00:25:16,813
It's… my icy heart.

516
00:25:16,814 --> 00:25:18,315
It's melting.

517
00:25:18,816 --> 00:25:20,317
Well, look, Mr. Warlock…

518
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:22,819
Please, please,

519
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
call me "Winter."

520
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:25,822
"Winter"?

521
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:26,823
Oh, yes, yes!

522
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:30,827
Suddenly, my whole outlook has changed

523
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:32,829
from bad to good.

524
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,830
Great.

525
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:36,833
Ah… but will it last?

526
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,836
I really am a mean and despicable creature

527
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:41,838
at heart, you know.

528
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,341
It's so difficult to…

529
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:45,844
Really change.

530
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:47,844
Difficult?

531
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,346
Ha ha ha!

532
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:51,048
Why, look here.

533
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,350
Changing from bad to good is as easy

534
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:56,854
as taking your first step.

There's all kinds of ways
we can help each other.

573
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,018
You can bring me nice, new toys

574
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,021
and… I can assist you with my magic.

575
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,024
Uh… how?

576
00:28:48,025 --> 00:28:49,025
Oh ho.

577
00:28:49,026 --> 00:28:50,328
I'll show you.

578
00:28:52,029 --> 00:28:55,734
Gaze into my magic crystal snowball.

579
00:28:57,034 --> 00:28:59,437
Someone is looking for you.

580
00:29:01,038 --> 00:29:03,039
Kris! Kris!

581
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,041
Jessica?

582
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,043
Go to her, lad.

583
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:08,745
Oh!

584
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,046
Only me, ma'am.

585
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:11,548
I thought I'd never find you again.

586
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,050
I wanted to bring you these…

587
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:16,353
Letters and notes from the
children of Sombertown,

588
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,055
asking for more toys.

589
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:20,557
You see, the Burgermeister

590
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:22,259
destroyed the ones you brought.

591
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,461
You tell those young'uns
there'll be plenty of toys,

592
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:27,064
but only if they behave themselves.

593
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,367
No cryin' or poutin' or…

594
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,069
Oh, I… I'll know.

595
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,572
I got ways of knowin'.

596
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:39,476
My, uh, personal friend, the
Warlock, taught me this.

597
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:42,879
Yes, sir, I can see 'em
when they're sleepin',

598
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,881
and I know when they're awake.

599
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:46,082
My goodness.

600
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,084
You know if they're bad or good?

601
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,287
Uh-huh. So you tell them to be good,

602
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,588
for goodness' sake.

603
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,590
Oh, thank you, Kris.

604
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,691
For what?

605
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,794
For being so kind,

606
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,595
for just being you.

607
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,598
Gol-Lee!

608
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,600
Now, uh…

609
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:05,602
About the toys…

610
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:08,104
I'll have to kind of
slip 'em in after dark,

611
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:10,106
when the Burgermeister is asleep,

612
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,308
so you tell all the boys and girls

613
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,511
to leave their doors
unlocked tomorrow night.

614
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:17,814
Well, Kris went
back to the Kringles'

615
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:19,616
to get some more toys.

616
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:22,119
And what do you think
those crazy Kringles did?

617
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,521
Yes, sir, they all moved
in on old Winter…

618
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:26,623
Lock, stock, and toy box.

619
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,024
I guess they figured it made sense

620
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,127
to move the source of
supply close to the demand.

621
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:34,130
Oh, I'm crowded!

622
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:37,133
But at least I'm loved.

623
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:39,135
Kris made a
list of all the children

624
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:40,337
and the toys they wanted.

625
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:43,140
He checked it over once,
then checked it over twice.

626
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,144
He tried to figure out just who
was naughty and who was nice.

627
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,347
Well, I guess they're all pretty nice.

628
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,649
So he packed up
and was off to Sombertown.

629
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,653
When Kris was
safe inside Sombertown,

630
00:30:57,154 --> 00:30:58,955
he tried all the doors,
and if they were open,

631
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:02,160
he knew a child lived inside
who was expecting a toy.

632
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,662
This is outrageous!

633
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,965
Toys! Toys everywhere!

634
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,169
What sort of criminal is this Kringle,

635
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,971
sneaking into houses by night?

636
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:16,774
I hereby decree

637
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,076
that all the town's doors and windows

638
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,381
will be locked tight against this prowler!

639
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,285
Well, more and more letters came

640
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,687
for Kris from the children.

641
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,089
Jessica would gather them
together and then give them

642
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,892
to the animals, who would deliver them.

643
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,195
And Kris, well, he just
couldn't turn anybody down.

644
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,498
But this time, he found all
the doors were locked to him.

645
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,902
Now, there was one special
toy he just had to deliver.

646
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,305
Susie, a tiny little girl
who was very, very sick,

647
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,209
had asked Kris for a toy Noah's ark.

648
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,311
Kris just couldn't disappoint her.

649
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,315
Topper, shh. What is it?

650
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,317
You have an idea…

651
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,319
How to get into the house,
but not through the door?

652
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,321
Up? The sky?

653
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,323
The moon?

654
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,325
The stars?

655
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,326
The chimney?

656
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,828
Go down the chimney?

657
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,031
Great idea!

658
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,134
Well…

659
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,536
Here goes.

660
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,039
And that's how he
started going down chimneys.

661
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,042
Oh! Now I understand.

662
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,344
That's fun!

663
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:29,346
What a great job I've got.

664
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,352
Ho ho ho ho! Come on.

665
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,355
There's a lot more chimneys
to explore tonight.

666
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,358
Ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!

667
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
More toys!

668
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,364
Discovered by the hearths
and the mantel pieces!

669
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,366
Each house in Sombertown

670
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,368
will be searched before dawn.

671
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,372
If any more toys are
found by the fireplace,

672
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,173
they will be confiscated

673
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,376
and the children severely punished!

674
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,378
So be it!

675
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,681
Yow!

676
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,884
But those letters
just kept right on coming.

677
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,186
Doggone, how can I get the toys to them?

678
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,388
They got to have toys.

679
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,091
Otherwise, their life will
be nothing but school

680
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,894
and chores and washing
their stockings and…

681
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,296
The stockings.

682
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,400
The stockings!

683
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,302
Take this to Jessica.

684
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,405
She'll know what to tell the children.

685
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,207
Company, halt!

686
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,411
Search the premises!

687
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,732
If you find so much as one marble

688
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,413
or half a Jack,

689
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,415
the house is under arrest!

690
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,419
Double time, hup!

691
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,423
We can't find anything, Herr Burgermeister.

692
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,424
Good. Very good.

693
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,427
No toys.

694
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,728
Nothing but drying stockings…

695
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:51,929
Ha ha ha…

696
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,631
As is proper.

697
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,433
About face!

698
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,435
Forward, march!

699
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,438
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup…

700
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,440
Whew!

701
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,242
Thank heaven there were no toys.

702
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,744
Whee! Look!

703
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,046
And that's how he
started leaving presents

704
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,248
in stockings.

705
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,450
More toys?

706
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,452
But how?

707
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,453
Ow!

708
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,456
Blast it! On my toe-ho-ho!

709
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,458
I will do what I should have done

710
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,460
a long time ago.

711
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:27,164
I will set a trap for
that bothersome Kringle.

712
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,267
His next visit to Sombertown

713
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,470
will be his last.

714
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,471
Oh, no!

715
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,473
I must warn Kris.

716
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,975
But she was too late.

717
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,477
Kris had already left with his toys.

718
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,480
Oh, Mr. Warlock…

719
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,481
Uh, "Winter," please.

720
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,183
You must help me stop Kris.

721
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,485
Please, use your magic.

722
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,489
Oh… alas.

723
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,491
I've been… disenchanted.

724
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,493
I have no more powers.

725
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,496
I can't even do card tricks.

726
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,498
Oh, that's terrible!

727
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,500
What shall we do?

728
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,004
Nobody is going to do anything!

729
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,506
You are all under arrest

730
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,509
for defying the law and making toys,

731
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,511
and for being an accomplice

732
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,513
to public enemy number one,

733
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,515
Kris Kringle!

734
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,018
To the dungeon!

735
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,520
Oh, I tell you,
things didn't look good.

736
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,725
And meanwhile, back in Sombertown…

737
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,328
Stop! You are under arrest!

738
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,529
Not me!

739
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,031
Wait! Look!

740
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:36,835
What can I do?

741
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,836
You have me.

742
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,038
Ha ha ha ha!

743
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,940
To the dungeon!

744
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,543
Children of Sombertown,

745
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:50,547
you will never, never, play again!

746
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,363
Well, sir, it looked like
Kris was finally beaten.

747
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,365
Herr Burgermeister, please.

748
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:08,566
You must set Kris

749
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:09,767
and the little Kringles free.

750
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,870
Ho ho! Ha ha! Set them free?

751
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:13,871
Never.

752
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,274
I promise they will never
disturb you again.

753
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:18,576
Bah!

754
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,778
What good are your promises?

755
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,079
Good-bye,

756
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
good luck,

757
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,483
and good riddance!

758
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,086
My own town, turned against me.

759
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,989
Well, my eyes are beginning to open

760
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,092
for the very first time to
what life is really all about.

761
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:38,095
And I know just where I belong…

762
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:41,099
With Kris, wherever he is.

763
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,101
Today is not the end.

764
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,103
It's only the beginning.

Well, Jessica
realized the first thing

792
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,223
she had to do was set
Kris and the others free.

793
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,025
Mr. Warlock.

794
00:38:48,226 --> 00:38:50,227
Hmm? Oh! Oh, Jessica.

795
00:38:50,228 --> 00:38:52,230
Oh, "Winter," please.

796
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,131
What are you doing here?

797
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,833
Trying to set you all free,

798
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,135
but I don't know how.

799
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:01,238
If only you had your magic powers back.

800
00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,740
Alas,

801
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,242
I've nothing but a few
meager magic leftovers

802
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,244
HERE IN MY POCKETS:

803
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:11,248
A short-circuited wand… useless;

804
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:14,251
A dried-up magic potion… powerless;

805
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:18,255
The tiny stubs of 100 or so magic candles;

806
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,257
And a few, last handfuls

807
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:23,260
of magic feed corn… just junk.

808
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,261
Ha ha. Ah, me.

809
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,263
Magic feed corn?

810
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:29,467
Well, it's of no use to us. It
can't dissolve prison walls.

811
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,670
All it can do is make reindeer fly.

812
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,072
Reindeer? Fly?

813
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,074
Yes, yes. Ridiculous, isn't it?

814
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,276
Later that
night, Jessica rounded up

815
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,278
some of Kris' reindeer friends.

816
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,981
They just had to take one
nibble of that corn,

817
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:45,283
and…

818
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,786
Whoo-ee! Look at them go!

819
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:49,987
I bet you know their names.

820
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:52,289
Dasher and Dancer…

821
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:54,291
And Prancer and Vixen…

822
00:39:54,292 --> 00:39:55,292
And Comet and Cupid…

823
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,294
And Donner and Blitzter.

824
00:39:57,295 --> 00:39:58,596
Yes, sir.

825
00:39:58,797 --> 00:39:59,797
And don't forget…

826
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:01,999
Heh heh heh!

827
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,602
No, that's another story.

828
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,051
Halt! Stop!

829
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:12,171
Stop!

830
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:13,509
Let's go, Donner.

831
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:15,712
Let's gooooo…

832
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,314
Onward, Vixen! Onward!

833
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:21,317
Well, I still have a little magic!

834
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:23,819
Ho ho! I'm not such a loser after all!

835
00:40:25,822 --> 00:40:29,827
And that's how Santa's
reindeer started to fly?

836
00:40:30,127 --> 00:40:31,507
That's just the way it happened.

837
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,130
We Meisterburgers shall hunt them down

838
00:40:34,331 --> 00:40:36,332
throughout the land.

839
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:39,336
Those rebels will not
have one moment's peace

840
00:40:39,436 --> 00:40:41,337
until they are captured again.

841
00:40:41,438 --> 00:40:42,438
Ha ha ha!

842
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,740
It's not even safe here.

843
00:40:44,841 --> 00:40:46,342
The guardsmen will be coming back.

844
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,743
We'll have to push on.

845
00:40:47,844 --> 00:40:50,347
I'll go anywhere you say, Kris.

846
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:52,849
Like Robin Hood of old,

847
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,851
Kris suddenly found
himself called an outlaw.

848
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,355
"Wanted dead or alive,

849
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:00,356
the terrible toymaker…"

850
00:41:01,357 --> 00:41:02,659
"Kris Kringle."

851
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,163
Ho ho ho ho ho!

852
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:11,167
Well, those posters are not
going to do them any good now.

853
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,369
Oh, Kris, let me take a good look at it.

854
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,371
Pretty grand, eh?

855
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,374
It's perfect.

856
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,376
Well, since I'm a Kringle,

857
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,379
I had to grow one sooner or later.

858
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:27,684
So that's why he has whiskers.

859
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:31,186
Ah, but you should not
use your Kringle name.

860
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:32,388
It's dangerous.

861
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,891
Not call myself Kringle?

862
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,391
What other name would suit me?

863
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:36,993
There is one.

864
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,696
You were wearing this when
we found you as a baby.

865
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:41,897
See what it says?

866
00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:42,901
"Claus."

867
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,303
Claus?

868
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,706
Your real name.

869
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,707
You must use it now.

870
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,409
I knew it, I knew it!

871
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,211
That's where he got his name from.

872
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,413
Mm-hmm, and it was that name

873
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:58,415
he asked Jessica to share.

874
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:02,419
It was that name Jessica
agreed to take, as his wife.

875
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Jessica.

876
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:06,223
Oh, she became Mrs. Santa Claus.

877
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,426
It was a lovely wedding.
Yes, sir.

878
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,828
They held it on Christmas Eve,

879
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,430
and since no town would welcome them,

880
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,432
they stood before the Lord

881
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,434
in the silent winter woods,

882
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:20,437
and a grove of pine trees
was their cathedral.

883
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,340
They put all that pretty
stuff onto the pine trees,

884
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,843
and then Kris and Jessica
placed their wedding gifts

885
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,046
to each other under the trees.

886
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,550
No church ever looked nicer.

887
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,452
Oh, please…

888
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,354
Let me have…

889
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,656
Just a little magic.

890
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:40,859
Ahh!

891
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,863
The very first Christmas trees.

907
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,551
But there was no rest for our
little group of outcasts.

908
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,856
Soon, they were forced up beyond
the reaches of civilization…

909
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,557
Up, far past the most northern city,

910
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:23,560
past where even most animals live,

911
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,562
up to the North Pole.

912
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,564
This is it, people. Ha ha ha, yes.

913
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:28,565
This is it.

914
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:30,567
We'll build ourselves a nice house.

915
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:31,570
Ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho…

916
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,570
Heck… ho ho… while we're at it,

917
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,572
we'll build ourselves a castle.

918
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:36,573
Ho ho ho ho ho!

919
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:39,577
And the best toy factory in the world.

920
00:44:39,578 --> 00:44:41,578
And that's just what they did.

921
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,580
And in no time at all…

922
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:46,583
Santa's castle and workshop!

923
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:48,585
Up at the North Pole!

924
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,587
Well, as soon as
the buildings were built,

925
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:53,590
they settled in and started
making toys in earnest.

926
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:57,594
Oh, they needed toys, because, you see,

927
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,596
despite everything the
Meisterburgers tried,

928
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:02,599
the legend of Kris Kringle… or
Claus, as he now was known…

929
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,602
Just grew and grew.

930
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,604
And, as the years went by,

931
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:10,607
animals delivered letters by the thousands.

932
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,610
Oh, just look at this list.

933
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:15,612
Well…

934
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:16,613
Load up the sleigh.

935
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,615
Ho ho!

936
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,617
Ah, this is the fourth trip this month.

937
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:23,620
You see, he still
had to travel by night

938
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:26,623
because he was considered an outlaw.

939
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:29,626
But when did they
stop calling him an outlaw?

940
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,628
Well, as time
went by, that changed.

941
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,630
You see, the Meisterburgers…

942
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,632
They kind of died off
and fell out of power.

943
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:38,635
And by and by, the good people realized

944
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:41,638
how silly the Meisterburger laws were.

945
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,640
Well, everybody had a wonderful laugh

946
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,642
and then forgot all about them.

947
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:48,645
Yes, sir. The older he got,
the more famous he became,

948
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,647
and the more folks loved him.

949
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,649
He's very good, isn't he?

950
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,651
Uh-huh. You bet.

951
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:58,655
Is that why he's
called "Santa Claus"?

952
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,657
That's why, honey.

953
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:01,658
That's why.

954
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,661
It turned into quite a proposition.

955
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:07,664
I can hardly keep up with the orders.

956
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:09,666
I'm afraid I'm going to have to limit

957
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:12,669
my journeys to… one a year.

958
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,672
But on which night should I go out?

959
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,674
I wonder.

960
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,676
It wasn't a
hard decision to make.

961
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:22,679
They chose, of course, the
holiest night of the year…

962
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,681
The night of profound love,

963
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:26,683
which was the perfect night for giving.

964
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:28,685
Christmas Eve?

965
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,687
Christmas Eve,

966
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:33,691
and that's how it all started.

967
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:39,095
How goes it, Mr. Warlock?

968
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,797
"Winter," please.

969
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,301
I've got my magic power working just fine.

970
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,704
I can cast up a big freeze. Yes, sir.

971
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:49,706
I think I can guarantee

972
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:52,709
a white Christmas.

973
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,710
Wonderful!

974
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:55,712
Then let's be off!

975
00:46:56,213 --> 00:47:00,217
Away we go!

976
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,622
And that is the story of Santa Claus.

977
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,124
Gee, he's so wonderful.

978
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,327
Everybody must love him.

979
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:12,729
Well… most everybody.

980
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,832
Oh, he's not considered an outlaw anymore,

981
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,734
but there still are some…

982
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,637
Eh, bah! Humbug!

983
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:23,939
Christmas is a bother…
The noise, the crowds.

984
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,642
I really wish it were outlawed.

985
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:27,744
How can they talk about Santa Claus

986
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:30,747
when there's so much
unhappiness in the world?

987
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,749
Poor, misguided folks.

988
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,751
They missed the whole point.

989
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:38,154
Lots of unhappiness? Maybe so.

990
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,958
But doesn't Santa take a little
bit of that unhappiness away?

991
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,562
Doesn't a smile on Christmas
morning scratch out a tear

992
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:47,764
cried on a Saturday?

993
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,066
Not much, maybe.

994
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:54,272
But what would happen if we
all tried to be like Santa

995
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:57,774
and learn to give as only he can give

996
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:00,777
of ourselves, our talents,

997
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:04,781
our love, and our hearts?

998
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,784
Maybe if we could all learn
Santa's beautiful lesson,

999
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:10,789
maybe there would finally be peace on earth

1000
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:13,790
and goodwill toward man.

1001
00:48:15,091 --> 00:48:16,893
Hey, it's getting late,

1002
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,095
and I've got these letters to deliver.

1003
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,197
And you better be getting home, too.

1004
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,098
Oh!

1005
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,199
And remember…

1006
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,301
Behave yourselves,

1007
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,704
'cause Santa can still look
into his magic snowball

1008
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,606
and see just what you're up to.

1009
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,208
And now that you know all about him,

1010
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:36,212
you can be darn sure that,
come snow or high water,
