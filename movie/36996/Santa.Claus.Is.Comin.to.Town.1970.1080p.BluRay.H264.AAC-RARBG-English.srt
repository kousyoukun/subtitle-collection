Man: Today, children everywhere

2
00:00:07,006 --> 00:00:09,007
are making preparations for an event

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:11,009
of world-shaking significance...

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,013
The annual visit of Santa Claus.

5
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:18,016
Informed sources report
legions of junior citizens

6
00:00:18,017 --> 00:00:20,020
are making monumental efforts not to cry

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,021
and not to pout.

8
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,023
Meanwhile, letters by the thousands

9
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,025
have been flooding postal facilities

10
00:00:27,026 --> 00:00:29,028
at the North Pole.

11
00:00:34,033 --> 00:00:37,035
Doggone thing always conks out when you...

12
00:00:37,036 --> 00:00:39,037
Well, hello there!

13
00:00:39,038 --> 00:00:41,039
My name's special delivery Kloogle...

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,041
S.D. for short.

15
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,044
Oh, I've got lots of
letters for Santa today,

16
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:48,046
and every year, they're the same.

17
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:52,050
Some ask for toys, but a lot ask questions.

18
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,053
Like, you take this one. I
bet one of you wrote it.

19
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,055
Child: "Dear Santa, why
do you wear a red suit?"

20
00:00:57,056 --> 00:01:00,058
Uh-huh. I thought so. And this one...

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:02,060
Child: My turn. "Dear Santa,

22
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,062
"why do you comedown the chimney

23
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:05,063
when I'm asleep?"

24
00:01:05,064 --> 00:01:06,064
How about these?

25
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:08,066
Child: Why do you have whiskers?

26
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,068
Boy: Why do you live at the North Pole?

27
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,069
Boy: Why do you leave presents?

28
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,271
Girl: Why do you always come

29
00:01:12,472 --> 00:01:13,472
on Christmas Eve?

30
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:15,674
Girl: Why do some people
call you Kris Kringle?

31
00:01:16,075 --> 00:01:18,076
Children: Why? Why?

32
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:19,077
Now, hold on, hold on!

33
00:01:19,078 --> 00:01:21,079
I can answer all your questions

34
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,081
because I know everything about Santa.

35
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:25,884
Now, Santa is a busy man.

36
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:29,087
He has no time to play.

37
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:31,091
He's got millions and millions of stockings

38
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,093
to fill on Christmas day.

39
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,094
So you'd better write your letter now

40
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:39,097
and mail it right away,

41
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,099
because he's getting ready

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,102

47
00:03:24,203 --> 00:03:26,707
So you want to know all about Santa, eh?

48
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:28,908
Best place to start is
at the very beginning,

49
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:31,810
when Santa was just a little baby.

50
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:34,212
Child: You mean, Santa was once...

51
00:03:34,213 --> 00:03:36,214
[Giggles] A baby?

52
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,216
Of course. Everybody's got to be a baby

53
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,418
at least once in their lives.

54
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:42,220
Now, this was years and years ago...

55
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:43,722
Oh, way back.

56
00:03:44,223 --> 00:03:46,224
In one of the northern countries,

57
00:03:46,225 --> 00:03:49,227
there was a small city called Sombertown.

58
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:52,230
It was a cold, cold place
which shivered in the shadows

59
00:03:52,231 --> 00:03:55,233
of the strange Mountain
of the Whispering Winds.

60
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:56,235
[Thunder]

61
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,039
Now, the main reason for all this gloom

62
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,840
was the mayor... a mean
old grouch of a fellow

63
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:04,043
who was known as
Burgermeister Meisterburger.

64
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:05,844
[Children laughing]

65
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,846
Herr Burgermeister! Herr Burgermeister!

00:04:08,247 --> 00:04:10,749
Look what was discovered
on your front stoop!

67
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,951
What? What, Grimsly?

68
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,252
The milk? The daily paper?

69
00:04:14,253 --> 00:04:16,555
No, sir... a baby!

70
00:04:17,256 --> 00:04:19,257
Oh, is that all?

71
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:21,259
[Choking]

72
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,260
A baby?!

73
00:04:22,261 --> 00:04:24,262
And there's a note.

74
00:04:24,263 --> 00:04:26,765
"Please, sir, take care of my child,

75
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:29,267
and protect him from the dangers

76
00:04:29,268 --> 00:04:31,970
of the Mountain of the Whispering Winds.

77
00:04:32,271 --> 00:04:33,772
He will be exceptional

78
00:04:34,273 --> 00:04:36,275
if only given the love he needs."

79
00:04:37,276 --> 00:04:40,278
I, Burgermeister Meisterburger,

80
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,279
take care of a baby?

81
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,282
Outrageous! What's its name?

82
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:46,284
This is the only clue, sir.

83
00:04:46,285 --> 00:04:49,287
It says, "Claus."

84
00:04:49,288 --> 00:04:53,292
Oh, take the little baggage to the orphan
asylum.

85
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,795

Where are you, baby Claus?

92
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,322
Oh, do come back! Come back!

93
00:05:24,323 --> 00:05:26,825
Narrator: Well, that strange
wind blew the little sleigh

94
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:30,329
right up to the Mountain
of the Whispering Winds.

[Thunder]

96
00:05:37,336 --> 00:05:39,337
For, you see, that Mountain was the home

97
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:42,340
of the awful, the terrible...

98
00:05:42,341 --> 00:05:44,343
Oh, I hate to even say his name!

99
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,345
That Mountain was the home of the...

100
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:51,349
Winter Warlock...

101
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:54,352
The strange hermit of the north

102
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:57,356
who lived alone in a ghostly palace of ice,

103
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:01,560
practicing his strange spells
and snowy incantations.

104

hide that baby, and fast.

[Footsteps]

107
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,371
They knew where that baby belonged,

108
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:15,874
so, quick as they could,
they started on their way.

109
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:17,077
Child: Where? Where?

110
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,477
Well, you see,

111
00:06:18,578 --> 00:06:20,579
just beyond the Mountain
was Rainbow River Valley,

112
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,383
and there, by a bend in the magical stream,

113
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,887
was the home of a jolly
family of little people...

114
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,289
Elves, you might call them.

115
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,991
Kringle was their name.

116
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:35,394
The door was answered by
an elf named Dingle...

117
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:36,696
Dingle Kringle, to be precise.

118
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:39,397
Yes? Who's there?

119
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:41,399
There's who? Ooh!

120
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,402
Wiggle my ears and tickle my toes!

121
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:46,605
Methinks I see a baby's nose!

122
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,907
It's more than a nose.

123
00:06:48,308 --> 00:06:50,309
There's a whole baby attached to it!

124
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,111
Better call my brothers.

125
00:06:52,512 --> 00:06:53,812
Wingle! Bingle!

126
00:06:54,113 --> 00:06:55,614
Tingle! Zingle!

127
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,215
What is it, Dingle?

128
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,417
It's a baby, Zingle.

129
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,919
A baby what, Wingle?

130
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,222
A baby baby, Tingle.

131
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,524
I like babies, Bingle.

132
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,928
Our baby's the best baby
of them all, Wingle.

133
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:11,030
Narrator: They brought the little fella

134
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,232
to the elf queen, Tanta Kringle.

135
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,035
A baby! What a splendid idea!

136
00:07:17,436 --> 00:07:19,238
He shall live with us and sleep with us

137
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,340
and drink warm cocoa with us.

138
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,844
What will we call him, Tanta Kringle?

139
00:07:24,044 --> 00:07:26,447
His license says, "Claus."

140
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,848
Unusual name.

141
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:31,451
However, we shall call him Kris...

142
00:07:31,652 --> 00:07:32,953
Kris Kringle.

143
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:34,253
[All cheering]

144
00:07:35,154 --> 00:07:36,455
Narrator: Well, those little Kringles

145
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:38,657
took that baby to their hearts.

146
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:41,560
Soon as he was old enough,
they set up a little school

147
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,762
and taught him all the important things...

148
00:07:44,463 --> 00:07:47,165
How to read and write and talk

149
00:07:47,466 --> 00:07:49,167
and count stars on a crystal night,

150
00:07:49,468 --> 00:07:50,769
and how to make toys.

151
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:51,970
Child: Make toys?

152
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,572
Oh, sure.

153
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:55,874
That was the Kringles' main occupation.

154
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:57,476
They were toymakers.

155
00:07:57,877 --> 00:07:59,178
The only problem

156
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,480
was there were no
children to give them to.

157
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:03,783
You remember, Sombertown
was on the other side

158
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:05,985
of the Mountain of the Whispering Winds,

159
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,787
and the little elves just couldn't make it

160
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,389
past the Winter Warlock.

161
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,292
So...

162
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,994
The toys kind of stacked up some.

163
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:18,196
It's really quite sad.

164
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,798
We will never be able

165
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:20,901
to transport our toys

166
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,001
over the mountain.

167
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,603
Someday, when I am bigger,

168
00:08:23,904 --> 00:08:25,905
I'll take them for you, Tanta Kringle.

169
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:28,008
Oh, that will be the day!

170
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:31,311
We will be great toymakers
again, as we once were.

171
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:32,612
When was that, Tanta?

172
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:35,315
Oh, years and years ago.

173
00:08:35,516 --> 00:08:37,517
The Kringles were world-renowned,

174
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:41,421

very first royal toymakers...

175
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,725

by giving the children toys?

394
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,144
Don't you know toys are against the law?

Gee. That's kind of a silly law.

407
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:33,172
I always wanted one when
I was a little girl,

408
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,774

She's a hardened criminal, I hear.

413
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:45,886
Well, maybe it is a silly law.

Well, look, Mr. Warlock...

546
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:22,819
Please, please,

547
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:23,820
call me "Winter."

548
00:25:23,821 --> 00:25:25,822
"Winter"?

549
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:26,823
Oh, yes, yes!

550
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:30,827
Suddenly, my whole outlook has changed

551
00:25:30,828 --> 00:25:32,829
from bad to good.

552
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:33,830
Great.

553
00:25:33,831 --> 00:25:36,833
Ah... but will it last?

554
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:39,836
I really am a mean and despicable creature

555
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:41,838
at heart, you know.

556
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,341
It's so difficult to...

557
00:25:44,842 --> 00:25:45,844
Really change.

558
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:47,844
Difficult?

559
00:25:47,845 --> 00:25:49,346
Ha ha ha!

560
00:25:49,847 --> 00:25:51,048
Why, look here.

561
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,350
Changing from bad to good is as easy

562
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:56,854
as taking your first step.

There's all kinds of ways
we can help each other.

601
00:28:40,017 --> 00:28:42,018
You can bring me nice, new toys

602
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:45,021
and... I can assist you with my magic.

00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,024

Kris: Jessica?

00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:07,043
Winter: Go to her, lad.

611
00:29:07,744 --> 00:29:08,745
Oh!

612
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,046
Only me, ma'am.

613
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:11,548
I thought I'd never find you again.

614
00:29:12,049 --> 00:29:14,050
I wanted to bring you these...

615
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:16,353
Letters and notes from the
children of Sombertown,

616
00:29:16,754 --> 00:29:18,055
asking for more toys.

617
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:20,557
You see, the Burgermeister

618
00:29:21,058 --> 00:29:22,259
destroyed the ones you brought.

619
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,461
You tell those young'uns
there'll be plenty of toys,

620
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:27,064
but only if they behave themselves.

621
00:29:27,565 --> 00:29:29,367
No cryin' or poutin' or...

622
00:29:31,068 --> 00:29:33,069
Oh, I... I'll know.

623
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,572
I got ways of knowin'.

624
00:29:35,473 --> 00:29:39,476
My, uh, personal friend, the
Warlock, taught me this.

625
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:42,879
Yes, sir, I can see 'em
when they're sleepin',

626
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:44,881
and I know when they're awake.

627
00:29:45,082 --> 00:29:46,082
My goodness.

628
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:48,084
You know if they're bad or good?

629
00:29:48,085 --> 00:29:50,287
Uh-huh. So you tell them to be good,

630
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,588
for goodness' sake.

631
00:29:52,089 --> 00:29:53,590
Oh, thank you, Kris.

632
00:29:53,691 --> 00:29:54,691
For what?

633
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:55,794
For being so kind,

634
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,595
for just being you. [Kiss]

635
00:29:59,096 --> 00:30:01,598
Gol-Lee!

636
00:30:02,099 --> 00:30:03,600
Now, uh...

637
00:30:04,101 --> 00:30:05,602
About the toys...

638
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:08,104
I'll have to kind of
slip 'em in after dark,

639
00:30:08,105 --> 00:30:10,106
when the Burgermeister is asleep,

640
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,308
so you tell all the boys and girls

641
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,511
to leave their doors
unlocked tomorrow night.

642
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:17,814
Narrator: Well, Kris went
back to the Kringles'

643
00:30:18,115 --> 00:30:19,616
to get some more toys.

644
00:30:20,117 --> 00:30:22,119
And what do you think
those crazy Kringles did?

645
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,521
Yes, sir, they all moved
in on old Winter...

646
00:30:25,122 --> 00:30:26,623
Lock, stock, and toy box.

647
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:28,024
I guess they figured it made sense

648
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,127
to move the source of
supply close to the demand.

649
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:34,130
Oh, I'm crowded!

650
00:30:34,131 --> 00:30:37,133
[Chuckles] But at least I'm loved.

651
00:30:37,134 --> 00:30:39,135
Narrator: Kris made a
list of all the children

652
00:30:39,136 --> 00:30:40,337
and the toys they wanted.

653
00:30:41,138 --> 00:30:43,140
He checked it over once,
then checked it over twice.

654
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:47,144
He tried to figure out just who
was naughty and who was nice.

655
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:50,347
Well, I guess they're all pretty nice.

656
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,649
Narrator: So he packed up
and was off to Sombertown.

657
00:30:52,850 --> 00:30:53,851
[Honking]

658
00:30:54,652 --> 00:30:56,653
Narrator: When Kris was
safe inside Sombertown,

659
00:30:57,154 --> 00:30:58,955
he tried all the doors,
and if they were open,

660
00:30:59,156 --> 00:31:02,160
he knew a child lived inside
who was expecting a toy.

661
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,662
This is outrageous!

662
00:31:06,163 --> 00:31:08,965
Toys! Toys everywhere!

663
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:12,169
What sort of criminal is this Kringle,

664
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,971
sneaking into houses by night?

665
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:16,774
I hereby decree

666
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,076
that all the town's doors and windows

667
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,381
will be locked tight against this prowler!

668
00:31:26,784 --> 00:31:28,285
Narrator: Well, more and more letters came

669
00:31:28,486 --> 00:31:29,687
for Kris from the children.

670
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:32,089
Jessica would gather them
together and then give them

671
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,892
to the animals, who would deliver them.

672
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:37,195
And Kris, well, he just
couldn't turn anybody down.

673
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:40,498
But this time, he found all
the doors were locked to him.

674
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,902
Now, there was one special
toy he just had to deliver.

675
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,305
Susie, a tiny little girl
who was very, very sick,

676
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,209
had asked Kris for a toy Noah's ark.

677
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:54,311
Kris just couldn't disappoint her.

678
00:31:54,312 --> 00:31:55,312
[Honking]

679
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:58,315
Topper, shh. What is it?

680
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,317
You have an idea...

681
00:32:00,318 --> 00:32:02,319
How to get into the house,
but not through the door?

682
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,321
Up? The sky?

683
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:05,323
The moon?

684
00:32:05,324 --> 00:32:08,325
The stars?

685
00:32:08,326 --> 00:32:09,326
The chimney?

686
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,828
Go down the chimney?

687
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,829
[Kiss]

688
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,031
Great idea!

689
00:32:16,334 --> 00:32:17,134
Well...

690
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,536
Here goes.

691
00:32:19,337 --> 00:32:22,039
Narrator: And that's how he
started going down chimneys.

692
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,042
Child: Oh! Now I understand.

693
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:26,344
Kris: That's fun!

694
00:32:26,345 --> 00:32:29,346
What a great job I've got.

695
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:32,349
[Honking] [Kris laughing]

696
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,352
Ho ho ho ho! Come on.

697
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:38,355
There's a lot more chimneys
to explore tonight.

698
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,358
Ha ha ha! Ho ho ho!

699
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
More toys!

700
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:46,364
Discovered by the hearths
and the mantel pieces!

701
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:49,366
Each house in Sombertown

702
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,368
will be searched before dawn.

703
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,372
If any more toys are
found by the fireplace,

704
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:56,173
they will be confiscated

705
00:32:56,374 --> 00:32:59,376
and the children severely punished!

706
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,378
So be it!

707
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:02,681
Yow!

708
00:33:04,382 --> 00:33:06,884
Narrator: But those letters
just kept right on coming.

709
00:33:07,385 --> 00:33:09,186
Doggone, how can I get the toys to them?

710
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,388
They got to have toys.

711
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:14,091
Otherwise, their life will
be nothing but school

712
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:16,894
and chores and washing
their stockings and...

713
00:33:17,795 --> 00:33:19,296
The stockings.

714
00:33:19,597 --> 00:33:21,400
The stockings!

715
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,302
Take this to Jessica.

716
00:33:25,403 --> 00:33:27,405
She'll know what to tell the children.

717
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,207
Burgermeister: Company, halt!

718
00:33:30,408 --> 00:33:32,411
Search the premises!

719
00:33:33,411 --> 00:33:34,732
If you find so much as one marble

720
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:36,413
or half a Jack,

721
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,415
the house is under arrest!

722
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,419
Double time, hup!

723
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,423
We can't find anything, Herr Burgermeister.

724
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,424
Good. Very good.

725
00:33:47,425 --> 00:33:48,427
No toys.

726
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:50,728
Nothing but drying stockings...

727
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:51,929
Ha ha ha...

728
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,631
As is proper.

729
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,433
About face!

730
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,435
Forward, march!

731
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,438
Hup, hup, hup, hup, hup...

732
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:03,440
Whew!

733
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:05,242
Thank heaven there were no toys.

734
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:06,744
Children: Whee! Look!

735
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,046
Narrator: And that's how he
started leaving presents

736
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,248
in stockings.

737
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,450
More toys?

738
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:15,452
But how?

739
00:34:15,453 --> 00:34:16,453
Ow!

740
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:19,456
Blast it! On my toe-ho-ho!

741
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:21,458
I will do what I should have done

742
00:34:21,459 --> 00:34:23,460
a long time ago.

743
00:34:23,461 --> 00:34:27,164
I will set a trap for
that bothersome Kringle.

744
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,267
His next visit to Sombertown

745
00:34:30,468 --> 00:34:33,470
will be his last.

746
00:34:33,471 --> 00:34:34,471
[Gasps] Oh, no!

747
00:34:34,472 --> 00:34:36,473
I must warn Kris.

748
00:34:36,474 --> 00:34:37,975
Narrator: But she was too late.

749
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,477
Kris had already left with his toys.

750
00:34:40,478 --> 00:34:43,480
Oh, Mr. Warlock...

751
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:44,481
Uh, "Winter," please.

752
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,183
You must help me stop Kris.

753
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:48,485
Please, use your magic.

754
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:50,489
Oh... alas.

755
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:54,491
I've been... disenchanted.

756
00:34:54,492 --> 00:34:56,493
I have no more powers.

757
00:34:56,494 --> 00:34:59,496
I can't even do card tricks.

758
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,498
Oh, that's terrible!

759
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:03,500
What shall we do?

760
00:35:03,501 --> 00:35:07,004
Grimsly: Nobody is going to do anything!

761
00:35:07,505 --> 00:35:09,506
You are all under arrest

762
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:12,509
for defying the law and making toys,

763
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:14,511
and for being an accomplice

764
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:16,513
to public enemy number one,

765
00:35:16,514 --> 00:35:18,515
Kris Kringle!

766
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:20,018
To the dungeon!

767
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,520
Narrator: Oh, I tell you,
things didn't look good.

768
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:25,725
And meanwhile, back in Sombertown...

769
00:35:28,526 --> 00:35:31,328
Stop! You are under arrest!

770
00:35:31,529 --> 00:35:32,529
Not me!

771
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,031
Wait! Look!

772

[Honking]

773
00:35:35,834 --> 00:35:36,835
What can I do?

774
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,836
You have me.

775
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,038
Ha ha ha ha!

776
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,940
To the dungeon!

777
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:46,543
Children of Sombertown,

778
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:50,547
you will never, never, play again!

779
00:35:50,548 --> 00:35:52,551
[Children crying]

780
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,363
Well, sir, it looked like
Kris was finally beaten.

781
00:36:05,864 --> 00:36:07,365
Herr Burgermeister, please.

782
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:08,566
You must set Kris

783
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:09,767
and the little Kringles free.

784
00:36:10,568 --> 00:36:12,870
Ho ho! Ha ha! Set them free?

785
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:13,871
Never.

786
00:36:14,272 --> 00:36:17,274
I promise they will never
disturb you again.

787
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:18,576
Bah!

788
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,778
What good are your promises?

789
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,079
Good-bye,

790
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
good luck,

791
00:36:23,081 --> 00:36:25,483
and good riddance!

792
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,086
My own town, turned against me.

793
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,989
Well, my eyes are beginning to open

794
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:35,092
for the very first time to
what life is really all about.

795
00:36:35,093 --> 00:36:38,095
And I know just where I belong...

796
00:36:38,096 --> 00:36:41,099
With Kris, wherever he is.

797
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:44,101
Today is not the end.

798

she had to do was set
Kris and the others free.

What are you doing here?

831
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,833
Trying to set you all free,

832
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,135
but I don't know how.

833
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:01,238
If only you had your magic powers back.

00:39:01,239 --> 00:39:02,740
Alas,

835
00:39:03,241 --> 00:39:05,242
I've nothing but a few
meager magic leftovers

836
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:07,244
here in my pockets:

837
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:11,248
A short-circuited wand... useless;

838
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:14,251
A dried-up magic potion... powerless;

839
00:39:14,252 --> 00:39:18,255
The tiny stubs of 100 or so magic candles;

840
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:20,257
And a few, last handfuls

841
00:39:20,258 --> 00:39:23,260
of magic feed corn... just junk.

842
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,261
Ha ha. Ah, me.

843
00:39:24,262 --> 00:39:26,263
Magic feed corn?

844
00:39:26,264 --> 00:39:29,467
Well, it's of no use to us. It
can't dissolve prison walls.

845
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:32,670
All it can do is make reindeer fly.

846
00:39:33,271 --> 00:39:35,072
Reindeer? Fly?

847
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:37,074
Yes, yes. Ridiculous, isn't it?

848
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,276
Narrator: Later that
night, Jessica rounded up

849
00:39:39,277 --> 00:39:41,278
some of Kris' reindeer friends.

850
00:39:41,279 --> 00:39:43,981
They just had to take one
nibble of that corn,

851
00:39:44,282 --> 00:39:45,283
and...

852
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,786
Whoo-ee! Look at them go!

853
00:39:48,787 --> 00:39:49,987

reindeer started to fly?

873
00:40:32,329 --> 00:40:34,130
We Meisterburgers shall hunt them down

throughout the land.

have one moment's peace

until they are captured again.

Ha ha ha!

00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:44,740
It's not even safe here.

The guardsmen will be coming back.

880
00:40:46,443 --> 00:40:47,743

himself called an outlaw.

Ho ho ho ho ho!

888
00:41:07,364 --> 00:41:11,167
Well, those posters are not
going to do them any good now.

889
00:41:11,368 --> 00:41:13,369
Oh, Kris, let me take a good look at it.

890
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,371

It's perfect.

893
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:20,376
Well, since I'm a Kringle,

894
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,379
I had to grow one sooner or later.

Girl: So that's why he has whiskers.

897
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:31,186
Ah, but you should not
use your Kringle name.

898
00:41:31,387 --> 00:41:32,388
It's dangerous.

899
00:41:32,489 --> 00:41:33,891
Not call myself Kringle?

900
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:35,391
What other name would suit me?

901
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:36,993
There is one.

902
00:41:37,394 --> 00:41:40,696
You were wearing this when
we found you as a baby.

903
00:41:40,897 --> 00:41:41,897
See what it says?

00:41:42,098 --> 00:41:42,901
"Claus."

905
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,303
Claus?

906
00:41:46,404 --> 00:41:47,706
Your real name.

907
00:41:48,406 --> 00:41:50,707
You must use it now.

908
00:41:50,908 --> 00:41:52,409
Boy: I knew it, I knew it!

909
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,211
That's where he got his name from.

910
00:41:54,412 --> 00:41:56,413
Narrator: Mm-hmm, and it was that name

911
00:41:56,414 --> 00:41:58,415
he asked Jessica to share.

912
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:02,419
It was that name Jessica
agreed to take, as his wife.

913
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Girl: Jessica.

914
00:42:03,421 --> 00:42:06,223
Oh, she became Mrs. Santa Claus.

915
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:08,426
Narrator: It was a lovely wedding.
Yes, sir.

916
00:42:08,827 --> 00:42:10,828
They held it on Christmas Eve,

917
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:13,430
and since no town would welcome them,

918
00:42:13,431 --> 00:42:15,432
they stood before the Lord

919
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,434
in the silent winter woods,

920
00:42:17,435 --> 00:42:20,437
and a grove of pine trees
was their cathedral.

921
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:23,340
They put all that pretty
stuff onto the pine trees,

922
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,843
and then Kris and Jessica
placed their wedding gifts

923
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,046
to each other under the trees.

924
00:42:29,347 --> 00:42:31,550
No church ever looked nicer.

925
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:35,452
Oh, please...

926
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,354
Let me have...

927
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:39,656
Just a little magic.

928
00:42:39,857 --> 00:42:40,859
Children: Ahh!

929
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,863
Girl: The very first Christmas trees.

But there was no rest for our
little group of outcasts.

946
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,856
Soon, they were forced up beyond
the reaches of civilization...

947
00:44:18,556 --> 00:44:20,557
Up, far past the most northern city,

948
00:44:20,558 --> 00:44:23,560
past where even most animals live,

949
00:44:23,561 --> 00:44:25,562
up to the North Pole.

950
00:44:25,563 --> 00:44:27,564
This is it, people. Ha ha ha, yes.

951
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:28,565
This is it.

952
00:44:28,566 --> 00:44:30,567
We'll build ourselves a nice house.

953
00:44:30,568 --> 00:44:31,570
Ha ha ha! Ho ho ho ho...

954
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:33,570
Heck... ho ho... while we're at it,

955
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,572
we'll build ourselves a castle.

956
00:44:35,573 --> 00:44:36,573
Ho ho ho ho ho!

957
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:39,577
And the best toy factory in the world.

958
00:44:39,578 --> 00:44:41,578
Narrator: And that's just what they did.

959
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:43,580
And in no time at all...

960
00:44:43,581 --> 00:44:46,583
Child: Santa's castle and workshop!

961
00:44:46,584 --> 00:44:48,585
Girl: Up at the North Pole!

962
00:44:48,586 --> 00:44:50,587
Narrator: Well, as soon as
the buildings were built,

963
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:53,590
they settled in and started
making toys in earnest.

964
00:44:53,591 --> 00:44:57,594
Oh, they needed toys, because, you see,

965
00:44:57,595 --> 00:44:59,596
despite everything the
Meisterburgers tried,

966
00:44:59,597 --> 00:45:02,599
the legend of Kris Kringle... or
Claus, as he now was known...

967
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:05,602
Just grew and grew.

968
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,604
And, as the years went by,

969
00:45:07,605 --> 00:45:10,607
animals delivered letters by the thousands.

970
00:45:10,608 --> 00:45:13,610
Oh, just look at this list.

971
00:45:13,611 --> 00:45:15,612
[Sighs] Well...

972
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:16,613
Load up the sleigh.

973
00:45:16,614 --> 00:45:18,615
Ho ho!

974
00:45:18,616 --> 00:45:20,617
Ah, this is the fourth trip this month.

975
00:45:20,618 --> 00:45:23,620
Narrator: You see, he still
had to travel by night

976
00:45:23,621 --> 00:45:26,623
because he was considered an outlaw.

977
00:45:26,624 --> 00:45:29,626
Girl: But when did they
stop calling him an outlaw?

978
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,628
Narrator: Well, as time
went by, that changed.

979
00:45:31,629 --> 00:45:33,630
You see, the Meisterburgers...

980
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:35,632
They kind of died off
and fell out of power.

981
00:45:35,633 --> 00:45:38,635
And by and by, the good people realized

982
00:45:38,636 --> 00:45:41,638
how silly the Meisterburger laws were.

983
00:45:41,639 --> 00:45:43,640
Well, everybody had a wonderful laugh

984
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:45,642
and then forgot all about them.

985
00:45:45,643 --> 00:45:48,645
Yes, sir. The older he got,
the more famous he became,

986
00:45:48,646 --> 00:45:50,647
and the more folks loved him.

987
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:52,649
Girl: He's very good, isn't he?

988
00:45:52,650 --> 00:45:54,651
Narrator: Uh-huh. You bet.

989
00:45:54,652 --> 00:45:58,655
Girl: Is that why he's
called "Santa Claus"?

990
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:00,657
Narrator: That's why, honey.

991
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:01,658
That's why.

992
00:46:01,659 --> 00:46:04,661
It turned into quite a proposition.

993
00:46:04,662 --> 00:46:07,664
I can hardly keep up with the orders.

994
00:46:07,665 --> 00:46:09,666
I'm afraid I'm going to have to limit

995
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:12,669
my journeys to... one a year.

996
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,672
But on which night should I go out?

997
00:46:15,673 --> 00:46:17,674
I wonder.

998
00:46:17,675 --> 00:46:19,676
Narrator: It wasn't a
hard decision to make.

999
00:46:19,677 --> 00:46:22,679
They chose, of course, the
holiest night of the year...

1000
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:24,681
The night of profound love,

1001
00:46:24,682 --> 00:46:26,683
which was the perfect night for giving.

1002
00:46:26,684 --> 00:46:28,685
Girl: Christmas Eve?

1003
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,687
Narrator: Christmas Eve,

1004
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:33,691
and that's how it all started.

1005
00:46:36,694 --> 00:46:39,095
How goes it, Mr. Warlock?

1006
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:40,797
"Winter," please.

1007
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:44,301
I've got my magic power working just fine.

1008
00:46:44,702 --> 00:46:47,704
I can cast up a big freeze. Yes, sir.

1009
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:49,706
I think I can guarantee

1010
00:46:49,707 --> 00:46:52,709
a white Christmas.

1011
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,710
Wonderful!

1012
00:46:53,711 --> 00:46:55,712
Then let's be off!

1013
00:46:56,213 --> 00:47:00,217
Santa: Away we go!

1014
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:05,622
And that is the story of Santa Claus.

1015
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,124
Girl: Gee, he's so wonderful.

1016
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,327
Everybody must love him.

1017
00:47:10,728 --> 00:47:12,729
Well... most everybody.

1018
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,832
Oh, he's not considered an outlaw anymore,

1019
00:47:16,033 --> 00:47:17,734
but there still are some...

1020
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,637
Eh, bah! Humbug!

1021
00:47:20,738 --> 00:47:23,939
Christmas is a bother...
The noise, the crowds.

1022
00:47:24,140 --> 00:47:25,642
I really wish it were outlawed.

1023
00:47:25,743 --> 00:47:27,744
How can they talk about Santa Claus

1024
00:47:27,745 --> 00:47:30,747
when there's so much
unhappiness in the world?

1025
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:32,749
Poor, misguided folks.

1026
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:34,751
They missed the whole point.

1027
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:38,154
Lots of unhappiness? Maybe so.

1028
00:47:38,155 --> 00:47:41,958
But doesn't Santa take a little
bit of that unhappiness away?

1029
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:45,562
Doesn't a smile on Christmas
morning scratch out a tear

1030
00:47:45,763 --> 00:47:47,764
cried on a Saturday?

1031
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:50,066
Not much, maybe.

1032
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:54,272
But what would happen if we
all tried to be like Santa

1033
00:47:54,772 --> 00:47:57,774
and learn to give as only he can give

1034
00:47:57,775 --> 00:48:00,777
of ourselves, our talents,

1035
00:48:00,778 --> 00:48:04,781
our love, and our hearts?

1036
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,784
Maybe if we could all learn
Santa's beautiful lesson,

1037
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:10,789
maybe there would finally be peace on earth

1038
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:13,790
and goodwill toward man.

1039
00:48:15,091 --> 00:48:16,893
Hey, it's getting late,

1040
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,095
and I've got these letters to deliver.

1041
00:48:19,296 --> 00:48:21,197
And you better be getting home, too.

1042
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:22,098
Children: Oh!

1043
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:23,199
And remember...

1044
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,301
Behave yourselves,

1045
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:27,704
'cause Santa can still look
into his magic snowball

1046
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,606
and see just what you're up to.

1047
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,208
And now that you know all about him,

1048
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:36,212
