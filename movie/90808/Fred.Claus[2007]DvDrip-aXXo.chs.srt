1
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:45,057
你可能已经听说许多故事开始:
<i>You've probably heard</i> <i>many stories that begin:</i>

2
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:49,736
很久以前,在很远的地方.
<i>"A long, long time ago,</i> <i>in a land far away."

3
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,131
这个也是.
<i>This one does as well.</i>

4
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,418
但我保证,这是个你从来没有听说过的故事.
<i>But I assure you, this is a story</i> <i>you have never heard before.</i>

5
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:59,889
是关于一个叫弗雷德的男孩.
<i>It's the story of a boy named Fred.</i>

6
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,050
而它这样开始.
<i>And it begins right here.</i>

7
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,179
是时候了.
It's time.

8
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,215
你得用力,亲爱的.
You must push, dear.

9
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,574
没错.
That's it.

10
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,777
没错.再来一次,快点.是的.
That's it. One more time, come on. Yes.

11
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,608
怎么了?
What's wrong?

12
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,377
这是我见过的最肥的孩子.
It's the fattest baby I've ever seen.

13
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,571
上帝.
Good Lord.

14
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,772
他为什么不哭呢?
Why does he not cry?

15
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,419
他说什么?
What did he say?

16
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:43,416
他十全十美.
He's perfect in every way.

17
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,379
我们叫他什么?
What shall we name him?

18
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,496
我父亲叫尼古拉斯.
My father was called Nicholas.

19
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,175
是的.
Yes.

20
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:51,411
尼古拉斯.圣诞老人.
Nicholas Claus.

21
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,775
我主尼可拉斯.
My Saint Nicholas.

22
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,973
弗雷德里克.
Frederick.

23
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:01,334
你愿意来见你弟弟?
Would you like to come and meet your brother?

24
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,978
来了.
Come along now.

25
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,333
fred爱尼古拉斯从他见过他的第一刻起.
<i>Fred loved Nicholas</i> <i>from the first moment he met him.</i>

26
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:34,095
事实上,那一天,他就给他一个承诺.
<i>In fact, that day, he made him a promise.</i>

27
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,935
我的哥哥世界,尼古拉斯.
I promise to be the best big brother in the whole world, Nicholas.

28
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:47,052
但弗雷德保证就开始的.
<i>But Fred's promise</i> <i>is just the beginning of his story.</i>

29
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,212
你看,有时候简单的保证...
<i>You see, sometimes it's easier</i> <i>to make a promise...</i>

30
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,412
...是让人.
<i>... than it is to keep one.</i>

31
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,739
该切蛋糕.
Time to cut the cake.

32
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:03,256
给你,尼古拉斯.我给你做的.
Here you go, Nicholas. I made this for you.

33
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,773
生日快乐.

34
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,818

- I thank you, Frederick. - That was very nice, Frederick.

35
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,731
尼古拉斯,你去哪儿?
Nicholas, where are you going?

36
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,778
有个可怜的孤儿叫henry的路上.
There's a poor orphan named Henry who lives down the road.

37
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,137
我把我的给他.他需要我的.
I'm bringing all my gifts to him. He needs them more than I.

38
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,574
真漂亮.
That's lovely.

39
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,289
你认为亨利需要日记叫尼古拉斯吗?
Do you really think Henry needs a journal with the name "Nicholas" on the cover?

40
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,293
弗来德利克!,这是他的东西.
Frederick, it's a saintly thing he does.

41
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,770
小圣尼可拉斯.
My little Saint Nicholas.

42
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,729
那么去fred.
<i>And so it went for Fred.</i>

43
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:37,379
每次他让他骄傲...
<i>Every time he managed</i> <i>to make his parents proud...</i>

44
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,371
弗来德利克!,你看起来不错.
Frederick, don't you look nice.

45
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:44,492
...尼古拉斯设法让他父母没有了.
<i>... Nicholas managed</i> <i>to make his parents prouder.</i>

46
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,892
门锁着,所以我决定送进烟囱!真有意思!
The door was locked, so I decided to drop down the chimney! What fun!

47
00:03:49,340 --> 00:03:50,375
哦,尼古拉斯.
Oh, Nicholas.

48
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,735
如果门锁着,为什么你不敲门吗?
If the door was locked, why didn't you just knock?

49
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,458
因为他想得不错.
Because he's inventive.

50
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,656
我自己的衣服,妈妈.
I made the outfit myself, Mother.

51
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,738
我不会告诉别人的.
I wouldn't go telling people that.

52
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:02,530
真的,弗来德利克!,你怎么就不能像你哥哥?
Really, Frederick, why can't you be more like your brother?

53
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:16,091
我不恨他.他是好意.
I don't wish to hate him. He means well.

54
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:19,252
我答应做世界上最好的哥哥.
And I promised to be the best big brother in the world.

55
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:23,098
你是唯一了解我,chirp-chirp了.
You're the only one who understands me, Chirp-Chirp.

56
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:40,737
弗来德利克!我注意到你喜欢树...
Frederick! I noticed how much you liked the tree...

57
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:44,529
...所以我们要把这房子里把礼物下面!
...so now we're gonna bring it inside the house and put presents under it!

58
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,053
是不是很棒啊?
Isn't that wonderful?

59
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,777
chirp-chirp没回来.
<i>Chirp-Chirp never returned.</i>

60
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,054
弗雷德里克?
Frederick?

61
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,698
可怜的fred.
<i>Our poor Fred.</i>

62
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,293
是我的吗?
Is this for me?

63
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,974
那个树最后吸管.
<i>That tree was the last straw.</i>

64
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,337
他开始恨他哥哥,他父母...
<i>He began to resent his brother,</i> <i>his parents...</i>

65
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,099
...甚至生命.
<i>... and even his life.</i>

66
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,216
尼古拉斯,你为什么不先打开你的吗?
Nicholas, why don't you open yours first?

67
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,292
旋转它.转!
Spin it. Spin it!

68
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,735
正如很多的孩子...
<i>And like many unhappy children...</i>

69
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,618
你为什么不打开吗?
Why don't you open yours?

70
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,171
...他变得愤怒.
<i>... he became angry.</i>

71
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,331
顽皮的,甚至.
<i>Naughty, even.</i>

72
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,419
我想知道是什么.
I wonder what it is.

73
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,288
怎么了,尼古拉斯?
What's the matter, Nicholas?

74
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,409
没什么.
Nothing.

75
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,137
但是fred变得更糟...
<i>But while Fred grew worse...</i>

76
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,292
...尼古拉斯越来越慷慨和的...
<i>... Nicholas grew more generous</i> <i>and eventually...</i>

77
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,610
...他实现他母亲的预言.
<i>... he fulfilled his mother's prophecy.</i>

78
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,489
在的,他是个圣人.
<i>In manhood, he literally became a saint.</i>

79
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,975
现在,这是一个鲜为人知的圣徒,但当你成为圣人...
<i>Now, it's a little-known rule of sainthood,</i> <i>but when you become a saint...</i>

80
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:10,610
...你别动,永恒的青春.
<i>... you freeze in time, eternally ageless.</i>

81
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,376
规则适用于死者的圣人和配偶,好.
<i>The rule applies to the family</i> <i>of the saint and the spouses, as well.</i>

82
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,897
现在,你可能已经有了很多的圣人nick.
<i>Now, you probably already have your</i> <i>suspicions of what became of Saint Nick.</i>

83
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:24,531
世界也知道爱他圣诞老人.
<i>The world grew to know</i> <i>and love him as Santa Claus.</i>

84
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,816
但是我告诉过你,这是个故事fred.
<i>But as I told you before,</i> <i>this is a story about Fred.</i>

85
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:33,650
然后是弗雷德故事发生在一个时间和地点...
<i>And the next part of Fred's story</i> <i>occurs in a time and place...</i>

86
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,050
...可能更熟悉你.
<i>... that might be a little more</i> <i>familiar to you.</i>

87
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,570
哦,哦,噢!圣诞快乐!人人都爱圣诞节!

<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i> <i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

你不能把我的电视!我看你在睡觉!
You can't take my television! I watch that in bed!

92
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,249
你疯了吗?
Are you nuts?

93
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,412
你不能和那样的人跑了.你几岁了?
You can't just run up and kick someone like that. How old are you?

94
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,093
-9.-9?
- Nine. - Nine?

95
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,455
你有55-inch等离子体电视房间?
And you have a 55-inch Plasma TV in your room?

96
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,531
圣诞老人给我去年圣诞节.
Santa got it for me for Christmas last year.

97
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,294
那个穿红衣服不是为你的未来.
The guy in the red suit's not looking out for your future.

98
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,859
你会喜欢的.
You're gonna get hooked on that.

99
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,454
我看到了.16万袋吃起来后...
I can see it now. Sixteen thousand bags of Cheetos later...

100
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,930
...你会醒来,你35岁,哭你生活在肥皂.
...you'll wake up, you're 35, crying about your life in front of the soaps.

101
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,137
我帮了你.你出去了,玩耍,交到朋友.
I did you a favor. You get outside, play around, make some friends.

玩踢罐子,做些运动的.

上学,你去运动.
Go to school, you're comfortable to play sports.

你有种族的背景?有自尊心的背景?
You have any ethnic in your background? Any ethnicity in your background?

105
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:33,090
我打赌你,这是美国.你知道我的意思吗?

上大学申请表.
Put it on the application for college.

107
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:38,530
突然,你有额外的钱.山姆叔叔很不明智.
All of a sudden, you get a little extra money. Uncle Sam's none the wiser.

108
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,816
你的钱,你买辆摩托车.
You take that extra money, you buy a motorcycle.

109

Maybe you meet a guy at school. Then you'll get pregnant with child.

你很幸运有孩子的.
You're blessed to have a kid in your life.

And you're gonna have a child before you graduate college.

Who are you gonna have to thank? Not the guy in the red suit.

115
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:58,895
但是你的朋友,fred.
But your pal, Fred.

有时会长!嘿,家伙,你有个女孩球鞋.
Sometimes it hurts to grow! Hey, guy, you got a girl that kicks.

117
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,936
那是你或者是因为你用电视的保姆?
Is that from you or is that because you use the TV as a babysitter?

抓住它,抓住它,抓住一次.

Come on, come on, come on, just a little bit.

Wanda, you have never been more attractive to me.

130

法国人都是给你的.
The French thing was to get you off the scent.

- We only help the people out. - What do you think you're doing?

257

等我一下.我会解决你.别挤我.
Just give me a second. I'll deal with you in a minute. Don't crowd my action.

258
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,531
然后帮助一些人的.
Then help some of these people out this year.

圣诞快乐.你很美,好.出去.
Merry Christmas. You're beautiful, great. Get out of here.

260
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:23,373
我不明白你的许可.你需要许可证干这个的.
I don't see your permit. You need a permit to work this street.

261
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:26,213
好的.我没必要回答你,伙计.我回答的.
Okay. I don't answer to you, buddy. I answer to the people.

- What's going on? - This guy's working without papers!

264
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:35,730
-他殴打救世军!-我不是骂救世军.
- And he's bashing the Salvation Army! - I'm not bashing the Salvation Army.

00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:39,495
我从没被什么.那不是打任何人.不编造谎言.
I never bashed anything. That wasn't bashing anybody. Don't make up lies.

让我看看你的证件,小丑.

Look up People Help the People on the Internet, you'll see a picture.

Why don't you step into the 21 st century?

270
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,735
好的.叫警察,伙计.
Right. Call the cops, man.

271

272
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,293

有人报警!
Somebody call the cops!

00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,050
拦住他!-他是个骗子!

只有一个人会离开这,我保证...
Only one man's gonna walk away from this thing, and I promise you...

你现在很重要.你在餐厅?
Kind of important you pick up right now. Are you at the restaurant?

Give a call when you get a chance, as soon as possible. Okay?

希望,我会找你.再见.
Hopefully, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

291
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,452
是的,她不接电话,是的...
Yeah, she's not picking up the phone, so...

292
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,775

What the hell, it's Christmas. Go ahead, make another call.

293
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,899
哦,孩子.
Oh, boy.

294
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:09,651
不,有没有灰色的.它完全白人.
No, there's not even a hint of gray left. It's gone totally white.

295
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:12,050
亲爱的,你觉得我看起来傻如果我染了?
Honey, you think I'd look silly if I dyed it?

296
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:14,939
你全发,亲爱的.
You have a nice full head of hair, honey.

297
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,534
这是白人,不过.过早的白人.
It's white, though. Prematurely white.

298
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,817
哦,尼克.你是怎么了.
Oh, Nick. You carry the weight of the world on your shoulders.

299

我不是压力.
I am not stressed out.

300

你好像很不开心.
You seem upset.

302

甜心,我们在去年2%的输出限额.
Sweetie, we're 2 percent behind our delivery quota of last year.

303
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,091
去年,我们几乎成功了.要饼干.
And last year, we barely made it. Want cookie.

304
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,455
甜心,你不能吃你的压力.
Sweetie, you cannot keep eating your stress away.

305
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,293
我是说,有点奇怪他们调查我.
I mean, it's a bit odd that they're checking up on me now.

306
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:42,931
我是说,他们以前从来没派个效率专家.为什么是现在?
I mean, they've never sent an efficiency expert before. Why now?

307
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:49,209
-尼克?-弗瑞德!

God, it's good hearing your voice. How've things been with you?

哦,嗯,好吧,好.你知道,生意了...
Oh, well, fine, fine. You know, business is crazy...

311
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:01,053
...但我们肿胀,我们来了.你好,嗯?
...but we're swell, we're swell. How are you, huh?

312

太好了.我真为你高兴,尼克.
That's great. I'm really happy for you, Nick.

那么,什么,佛瑞德?有什么我能为你做什么?
So, what's up, Fred? Is there anything I can do for you?

316
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:15,056
如果你真想送我礼物,我猜是你送的...
If you really wanted to send me a gift, I guess it would be okay if you sent...

<i>... $5000 to the police station</i> <i>in Michigan Avenue in my name.</i>

318
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,372
5000美元?
Five thousand dollars?

319
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,815
我没事,对了.我不…..我没事.
<i>I'm fine, by the way. I don 't... I'm fine.</i>

320

...我不行.-听起来他在困境.
...but I know it can't be good. - It sounds like he's in a tough spot.

323
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,892
如果你想为他做点什么...
<i>If you wanna do something for him...</i>

324
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,178
...我知道这很难,但是你需要练习强烈的爱,亲爱的.
...I know it's hard, but you need to practice tough love, honey.

325
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,171
-我是个圣人,甜心.-粗暴的爱.

326
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,137
有点困难我的爱.
Tough love's a little difficult for me.

327

That's... I don't understand, though. I'm giving you 5, Fred, so...

你一定会有人想给的...
You gotta be open to someone trying to give...

337
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,615
...得给别人的.

I don't think that's a good idea, me and you to be with each other.

...put the stars up where the little guys can't reach them. It's easy.

360
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,976
我很难把22nd了.我有我的.
I'd have to have a hard out by the 22nd. That's when I have my deal happening.

This isn't about me coming up, then you having Mom ambush me...

363

对不起.我要练习很爱你,伙计.好吗?

And you said, "No, Wanda, I don't!"

我有个兄弟...我的母亲和父亲...

我们和儿童服务处,先生.我们要把这个小一个称职的家.
We're with Child Services, sir. We're here to remove this minor from an unfit home.

398

根据我们的记录,他一年前去世了.
According to our records, his father passed away a year ago.

399

你不能指望别人,放纵的.

你得自己照顾自己.

你知道该怎么做,对吗?

405
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,614
我们直说吧.
Let's get something straight.

406
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:04,170
如果你要等我唱太阳快出来了...
If you're waiting for me to sing " The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" on the way...

407
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,615

嘿,兄弟fred,我可以,妓女?
Yo, brother Fred, can I get a "Ho, ho"?

00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,931
不.
No.

501
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,897
你scrooge,你输了.
You Scrooge, you lose.

502

这是钥匙整个过程...

哦,是的.是的,现在...
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right now...

...我们有johnny罗林中学的新斯科舍.他是占领第一位.
...we got Johnny Rollins in Nova Scotia. He's occupying the number one spot.

508

上个月他咬他父亲和他的牙医.
Last month he bit his father and his dentist.

509
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,733
但是为什么他咬他们?
But why did he bite them?

510
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:37,933
嗯,我猜他们有他们的手太接近他.
Well, I assume that they got their hands too close to his mouth.

511
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:41,410
当然,有时候孩子都不好.
Of course, sometimes kids are both naughty and nice.

512

所以,我们做一个最近地,走开...

哦,孩子.好吧,这看起来很被刺伤了.
Oh, boy. Okay, that seems pretty cut and dried.

520

什么,我们不知道发生了什么,什么...?
What, we don't know what happens, what...?

You betcha. Fred, you just stay right there. Don't you move an inch.

我最好查查的瑞典游泳的人.

525
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,937
-fred是吧.-你觉得呢?

他会有很大帮助.-你还好吗?能和你.

我们去工作.

532
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:42,129
现在,我会向你解释的,很简单,好吗?
Now, I'm going to explain this to you in very simple terms, okay?

533
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:46,009
现在,看到那些蓝色档案?我要你检查这些文件,好吗?
Now, see those blue files? I want you to review those files, okay?

534
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,098

...砰!告诉他的.

那只是bethesda,马里兰.
That's just Bethesda, Maryland.

545
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,733
好吧,各位.哦,我的天,这是圣诞老人来啦!
<i>All right, everyone. Oh, my goodness,</i> <i>it's "Here Comes Santa Claus!"</i>

00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,374
你不必旅游直升机,northcutt先生的.
You didn't have to travel by helicopter, Mr. Northcutt.

547
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,178
我会很乐意把雪橇.
I would've happily sent the sleigh.

548
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,058
我讨厌驯鹿.
I despise reindeer.

549
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,977
你安顿好吗?我们有你的房间准备.

552
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,131
嗯,听起来会很出色.
Well, that sounds like it's gonna be dandy.

553

...the average size of a child's wish list has grown a lot in the last 200 years.

在1800s,比如,孩子们很少要求更多东西...
In the 1800s, for example, children rarely asked for more than one item...

556
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:03,052
...通常这些是一个无形的.

557
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,735
就像家人健康还是结束战争和饥荒.
Something like a family member's health or the end of war or famine.

558
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,653
我记得.试试说的烟囱,嗯?
I remember that. Try fitting that down the chimney, huh?

立法的孩子越来越复杂的玩具...

562
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,973
...让你的工作更每年后面.还不够好.
...are putting your operation further behind each year. It's not good enough.

563
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:29,372
嗯,现在,我们不是给每个孩子都想要的玩具.
Well, now, we are not here to give every child every toy that they want.

564
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:33,419
northcutt先生,是圣诞节的感激的我们有.
Mr. Northcutt, part of Christmas is being grateful for the things that we can have.

565
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:36,652

- Yes, well, if it were only that simple. - It's not?

566

不.伤心.你看...
No. Sadly. You see...

567
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,097
...董事会的考虑...
...the board is seriously considering...

568
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:44,769
...你下来.
...shutting you down.

569
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,135
什么?
What?

570
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,972
-这不公平.-就算我们吗?
- That's so unfair. - Shutting us down?

571
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:50,619
streamlining,的...
Streamlining, consolidating...

572
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:53,578
...外部采办一个全新的行动建立的...
...outsourcing an entirely new operation based at...

573
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,208
...我知道这很难找你...

574
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,336
...建立在南极.

575
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:03,853
不只是你.我们把牙的孩子,有齿的.
It's not just you. We're putting the tooth fairy on a one child, one tooth system.

576
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,978
你的牙,有巴克,放在枕头下面.
You lose your first tooth, get a buck, put it under the pillow.

577
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,495
然后继续你的生活.这一点...
But then get on with your life. It's getting a bit...

578
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,174
你不觉得吗?还有,我们要把复活节兔子.
Don't you think? Also, we're gonna dump the Easter bunny.

579
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,212
太没道理了.
It just doesn't make any sense anymore.

580
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,814
我是说,复活节兔子和鸡蛋的.
I mean, Easter and bunnies and eggs and all that.

581
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,732
那个协同?不明白.
Where's the synergy? Don't get it.

582
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,100
现在,让下名单上,可以吗?
Now, let's move on to the next item on the list, shall we?

583
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,934
你实际上给那些精灵吗?
How much are you actually feeding those elves?

584
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,931
wandablinkowski,芝加哥,伊利诺伊.
Wanda Blinkowski, Chicago, Illinois.

585
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,328
那个特别的人?
Is that someone special?

586
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,775
是的.那是我女儿,那里.
Yeah. That's my girl, there.

587
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,330
哦,不.我完全给忘了.听着,我有硬币这里.
Oh, no. I totally spaced out. Look, I got a quarter right here.

588
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,259
嗯,对不起,亲爱的,但是2分钟太迟了.
<i>Well, I'm sorry, darling,</i> <i>but you're two minutes too late.</i>

589
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,809
-真的吗?-是的,真的.
- Really? - Yeah, really.

590
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,580
那一定让你感觉不错,人与你争论.
That must make you feel bad, having people argue with you.

591
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:55,698
是的,嗯,绝对不是最工作.
Yeah, well, it's definitely not the favorite part of my job.

592
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,533
我补偿你?我带你去吃饭.
How about I make it up to you? Let me take you to dinner.

593
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,169
去吃饭吗?
Go to dinner with you?

594
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:03,412
就当是餐的谈话.
Consider it a meal and sparkling conversation.

595
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,449
不,不行,谢谢,但我不能.
No, I can't. Thank you, but I can't.

596
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,817
总是很痛苦看一个坠机,伙计.
It's always painful to watch a guy crash and burn, my man.

597
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,174
你有男朋友吗?
You have a boyfriend?

598
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,572
不.不,事实上,我没有.
No. No, actually, I don't.

599
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,935
嗯,这是好事.你说什么?
<i>Well, that's a good thing.</i> <i>What do you say?</i>

600
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,570
嗯,我给你一张票.
Well, I'll give you a ticket.

601
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,096
我会给你我的名片.
And I'll give you my card.

602
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,898
好的.很高兴见到你.
Okay. Nice to meet you.

603
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,415
这可能是我收到的票.
<i>This may be the best ticket I ever got.</i>

604
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,616
你要不到30天,你知道吗?
<i>You gotta pay it within 30 days,</i> <i>you know that?</i>

605
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,736
我会在那之前,对吗?
<i>I'll see you before then, right?</i>

606
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,173
爱尔帕索.
El Paso.

607
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:51,729
好.
Great.

608
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:56,018
你不会相信这个!再要求圣诞老人来啦!
<i>You're not gonna believe this! Another</i> <i>request for "Here Comes Santa Claus!"</i>

609
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,296
这一次beth会计部.给你!
<i>This time from Beth in Accounting.</i> <i>Here you go!</i>

610
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,136
你开玩笑吗?你开玩笑的圣诞老人吗?
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding me with the "Santa Claus" again?

611
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,978
嘿,dj!
Hey, DJ!

612
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,014
-dj唐尼!-怎么了,弗莱德!
- DJ Donnie! - What up, Fred!

613
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:11,014
别玩同一首歌的.就像精神折磨.
Stop playing the same song over and over again. It becomes like mental torture.

614
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,011
但是,fred,很上口!
But, Fred, it's so catchy!

615
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:19,179
上帝.好吧,donnie.这是一首是在的.
God. Okay, Donnie. It's one song that's being played over and over again.

616
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:22,696
唯一让那是你在同样的歌.
And the only thing that breaks that up is you announcing it's the same song.

617
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,420
很好去玩的.
It would be a nice gesture to play something different.

618
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:27,411
-我说不!-唐尼,换歌.
- I said no! - Donnie, change the song.

619
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,338
-不!不!-换歌!
- No! No! - Change the song!

620
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,968
你知道吗?我要换歌,那么,给你.
You know what? I'm gonna change the song, then, for you.

621
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,529
你拿的什么?音乐是爱.
What are you getting physical for? Music's about love.

622
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,009
别和我的身体.我们想分享.
Don't get physical with me. We're trying to share.

623

唐尼,停下.你就像个训练狗.
Donnie, stop. You're acting like an untrained dog.

Get ahold of yourself. Take a breath. Stop swinging at me. Will you calm down?

好吧,你知道吗?我要supernanny你.
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna Supernanny you.

627

把你的柜子.你不能控制自己.
Put you in the Naughty cabinet. You can't handle yourself.

628
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,410
听我说,冷静下来了.住手.
Listen to me, calm it down a little. Stop it.

629
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,174
说话.说话.
Use your words. Use your words.

630
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:01,291
我会让你一旦对不起你准备绕过拐角...
I'll let you out once you're sorry and you're ready to turn a corner...

631
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,248

...and be a team player, okay? - Don't do it! Put my elf foot up your butt!

You got the same thing playing all the time. Let's liven it up! Let's get dancing.

听起来很生气!
It sounds angry!

641

645
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,576
你生活在北极...

...将决定简单three-strike政策.

熬过圣诞没有三次,我送回来的报告.
Make it through Christmas without three strikes, I send back a positive report.

648
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,209

尤其是精灵.

I am confident that they will impress you, sir.

654

660
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,017
他们从没表现的.我保证.
They have never behaved like that before. I assure you.

661
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,932
精灵纪律.
No elf discipline.

662
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:56,297
显示完全失去控制你的工人.
Showing a complete lack of control over your entire workforce.

663
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,930
这是大事.我很失望.那是一个好球.
That's a biggie. It's disappointing. And that would be strike one.

664
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:05,213
对不起,我没有你的名字.-哦,是fred.那是我哥哥.
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. - Oh, that's Fred. That's my older brother.

665
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:08,929
-他是来帮你的.-我不知道你还有个弟弟.
- He's just helping out for the season. - I didn't know you had a brother.

666
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,332
northcutt先生,我应该有人告诉你.威利!
Mr. Northcutt, I should have someone show you around. Willie!

667
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,212
一下,那里,northcutt先生的.
Take a tour, there, Mr. Northcutt.

668
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:21,178
fred.什么你到底在干什么?
Fred. What in the heck are you doing?

669
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:25,339
nick,我坦白跟你,dj是个问题.
Nick, let me be completely honest with you here, the DJ is a real problem.

670
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,412
fred,他是精灵那玩的.
Fred, he's an elf that plays records.

671
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:32,017
nick,他继续演奏老调反复的...
Nick, he continued to play the same song over and over and over and over...

672
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,414
给你.给你.
Got you. Got you.

673
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,289
他决定把手放在我把身体想要伤害我.
He then decided to lay his hands on me and get physical and tried to hurt me.

674
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,939
好吗?现在,我要做个决定的时刻.
Okay? Now, I have a decision to make in that moment.

675
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:44,137
我想找打?我想英镑精灵的头?
Do I wanna try to get physical? Do I wanna pound this elf's head in?

676
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:48,259
答案是不.我想他知道怎么感觉不尊重...
The answer to that is no. I want him to know how it feels not to be respected...

677
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,856
...当你在做你的工作.-小点声.小声点.
...when you're trying to do your work. - Just lower your voice. Keep it down.

678
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:55,410
老实说,如果你决定要惩罚他,我不会生你的气.
And to be honest, if you decide to punish him, I'm not gonna be mad at you.

679
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,138
我不会生你的气.
I'm not gonna be upset with you.

680
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,134
如果你想把锤子看扁他dj手上,做,伙计.
If you wanna bring the hammer down upon his little DJ hands, do it, dude.

681
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:05,418
好的.好的.那是一个想法.我会坐在这让它滚.
Okay. All right. That's a thought. And I'm gonna sit on that and let it boil.

682
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:09,892
但我要告诉你,精灵必须保持警觉,现在.
But what I'm trying to tell you is, the elves have got to stay sharp, right now.

683
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,051
非常重要,好吗?
Very important, okay?

684
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:15,769
我们不能有任何的问题,了,好吗?
We can't have any type of problems, anymore, okay?

我明白了.我们说,兄弟,我知道你从哪儿来的.
I get it. We're two brothers talking now, I know where you're coming from.

686
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,491
才重要.是.
That's all that counts. That's what counts.

687
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,896
现在,你说,不会的...
Now that you said that, it's not gonna happen...

688
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,496
...我会杀了他的.-不,不,不,你不必.
...I'm gonna kill him with kindness. - No, no, no, you don't have to.

689
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:31,613
爱,的,是你喜欢辐射什么的.
Love, kindness, it's coming off of you like radiation or something.

690
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,055
不,不,不.你会在你的.
No, no, no. You're gonna stay at your station.

691
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,289
好的.
Right.

692
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:37,371

What the heck is Mom doing in the house?

701
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,935
我要你说实话,她知道我在这儿吗?
I want you to be honest, does she know I'm here?

说我疯了,但我妈妈来探望我度假每年.
Call me crazy, but my mom comes and visits me for the holidays every year.

703
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,293
我不会在那里,nick,因为我不去见妈妈...
I'm not going in there, Nick, because I don't visit with Mom...

704
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:14,850

...down in the Naughty-Nice Department.

719
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,579
我一直在做一个极好的工作.
I wouldn't say I've been doing a bang-up job.

考虑什么?
Considering what?

725
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:32,936
还没时间的宴会.
Considering that you didn't have the time to come to our anniversary party.

Come on, now, that massage chair, that looked very, very expensive.

你还记得你写的,弗雷德里克?
Do you remember what you wrote on the card, Frederick?

734
00:45:57,700 --> 00:45:59,770
嗯,是这样的:

周年纪念快乐,我希望你在吗?
"Happy anniversary, I hope you choke on your meal"?

736
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,138
现在你很傻.
Now you're just being silly.

737
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,860
有汁的,亲爱的.土豆非常干燥.
Have some gravy, darling. The potatoes are awfully dry.

738
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,376
phyllis,我希望你不会说,尼古拉需要减肥.
Phyllis, I wish you wouldn't do that, because Nicholas needs to lose weight.

739
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:15,859
他很好!
He's perfect!

740
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:19,171
你会飞的一个晚上.
You're looking at a man who can fly around the world in a single night.

741
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,018
-难以置信!-好吧,妈妈.
- That's unbelievable! - Okay, Mom.

742

你知道,我不能克服的,尼古拉斯.我只是...你让我吃惊.
You know, I can never get over that, Nicholas. I just... You amaze me.

743
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,489
-是不是很棒啊?-我觉得好极了.
- Isn't it amazing? - I think it's absolutely amazing.

...breaking and entering, staring at little children...

746
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:36,291
...吃小孩子饼.
...eat the little kids' cookies and stuff.

747
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:39,497
那是个杰出的事件.我完全疯了...
That's a phenomenal occurrence. And I get jacked out of my mind...

748
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:43,016
...只想着那些法律被破坏.你们不觉得吗?
...just thinking about all those laws being broken. Don't you guys feel it?

749
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:45,978
弗来德利克!,你为什么这么沮丧?
Frederick, why are you so upset?

750
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:48,376
哦,来吧,妈妈.不…..
Oh, come on, Mom. Don't...

751
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,820
我希望你更像你哥哥.
I just wish you were a little more like your brother.

752
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,016
好.好的.
Great. Okay.

753
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,252
我有预感我会舒服多回我的小屋...
I have a feeling I'd be much more comfortable back in my little hut...

754
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,536
...和"和奶昔.
...with some Hot Pockets and a milkshake.

755
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,810
快点.别这样.fred.
Come on. Don't be like that. Fred.

756
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,848
我的家庭会议.我找到这个...
I just love meeting people's families. I find it so...

757
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:12,294
...暴露了.
...revealing.

758
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:17,973
晚安,多霜!明天见!
Night, Frosty! See you tomorrow!

759
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:26,055
-弗瑞德!好极了!进来,我的朋友.-你好,威利?
- Fred! Terrific! Come on in, my friend. - How are you, Willie?

760
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,012
我很好!拉大便了.
I'm great! Pull up a stool.

761
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,859
嘿,蛋酒给fred,上进.
Hey, eggnog for Fred, Frosty.

762
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,976
-当然,他们正赶来.-要双份的.
- Sure, they're on the way. - Make it a double.

763
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,255
谢谢.
Thank you.

764
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,489
嘿,fred.
Hey, Fred.

765
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,213
-莎莉.是的.
- Charlene. - Yeah.

766
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,292
你知道,你看到这些人了...
You know, you see these people after work...

767
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,055
...我甚至不认识他们.你知道,比如,哦,当然.沙琳.
...and I don't even recognize them. You know, like, "Oh, of course. Charlene."

768
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:58,450
是的.-晚安,fred.
- Yeah. - Good night, Fred.

769
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:02,620
-晚安,沙琳.-晚安...
- Good night, Charlene. - Good night...

770
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,772
-威利.-威利.
- Willie. - Willie.

771
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,576
fred,我不…..我不…..
Fred, I don't... I don't...

772
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,132
我不明白,fred.
I don't understand, Fred.

773
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:19,371
她不记得我的名字?
She doesn't remember my name?

774
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:22,698
怎么了,佛瑞德?是啊...?是我,不是吗?
What is it, Fred? Is it...? It's me, isn't it?

775
00:48:22,860 --> 00:48:25,738
你可以告诉我,fred,没关系.因为你是我的朋友.
You can tell me, Fred, it's okay. Because you're my friend.

776
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:28,130
就是这样...她觉得我是个怪人.
It's just that... She thinks I'm a freak.

777
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,335
我爱她.我爱她.
I love her. I love her.

778
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,012
威利,瞧.你想笑.你是很多乐子的.
Willie, now look. You love to laugh. You're a lot of fun to be around.

779
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:38,569
fred,我开玩笑的.
Fred, I can't even tell a joke.

780
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,857
我说最后一道的.恐怕都会听.
I say the last line first. I'm afraid everyone's gonna stop listening.

781
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,453
这很简单.
This thing is very easy.

782
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:47,533
让她知道你准备好玩,你不会道歉.
Let her know that you're ready for fun, and you are not gonna apologize for it.

783
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:53,209
你知道,去年在after-christmas派对...
You know, at last year's after-Christmas party...

784
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,132
...我请她跳舞.
...I almost asked her to dance.

785
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,370
我知道我不会跳舞.
Then I remembered I can't dance.

786
00:48:58,460 --> 00:49:00,928
-呢.-什么?
- Yet. - What?

787
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:02,933
不能跳舞.
Can't dance yet.

788
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:12,100
fred.真荒谬.
Fred. I feel ridiculous.

789
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:15,013
我不知道怎么跳舞.我不知道舞步.
I don't know how to dance. I don't know the steps.

790
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:18,377
这让我很不舒服.
This is very uncomfortable for me.

791
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:21,293
快点.离开你一会儿.进入你的身体!
Come on. Get out of your head for a second. Get into your body!

792
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,618
好吧,看,我不会那么做的.我不可能.
Okay, see, I'm not gonna do that. I can't actually do that.

793
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,340
我们不再跟这个,我们要找的...
We're no longer talking with this, we're gonna talk with...

794
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,774
带.来了.
Bring it. Bring it right now.

795
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,296
把绿色天那你把它给我.
Bring all that green goodness that you have on and bring it right up on me.

796
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,691
来吧,这个漂亮的绿天使.现在,手放在这里.
Come on, this beautiful green angel. Now, put one hand here.

797
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:38,613
好.把另一把了.来吧,握的.别害羞.
Great. Put another hand here. Come on, grip it. Don't be shy.

798
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:40,930
我们要做的就是有点宝贝思维.
All we're gonna do is a little bit of a baby sway.

799
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:43,660
这样,我的摇滚去.只是放松.
That's it, just a gentle rock back and forth. Just easy.

800
00:49:43,820 --> 00:49:45,697
现在,有短的,这很好...
Now, you got short arms, which is good...

801
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,657
...因为你得靠近.
...because it means you gotta get close.

802
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,698
快点,这个大拖轮上岸了.起锚.
So go ahead, pull this big tugboat to shore. Anchors aweigh.

803
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,810
没错.好吧,现在,接下来你把手放在背后.
That's it. Okay, now, the next thing you do is put your hand on my back.

804
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,335
那不是我,但这是有点调皮.
That's not my back, but it is a little bit naughty.

805
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:04,209
我喜欢你想去的地方,但是为了这个目的,让我们保持专业.
I like where you're headed, but for these purposes, let's just keep it professional.

806
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,972
-fred.-现在,记住,威利...
- Fred. - Now, remember, Willie...

807
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:08,859
...跳舞,跳舞不是,对吗?
...dancing is not about dancing, right?

808
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,818
关于连接的.现在,看着我的眼睛.
It's about connecting. Now, look me in the eye.

809
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,136
好.现在,如果我是个女孩,我起鸡皮疙瘩你带来了.
Great. Now, if I was a girl, I'd get goose bumps with what you just brought.

810
00:50:16,620 --> 00:50:20,249
其他的跳舞是完美的桥梁吻.
The other great thing about dancing is it's the perfect bridge to a kiss.

811
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:23,333
你所要做的就是乐趣,我知道我会开心的...
So all you gotta do is have fun, let me know I can have fun...

812
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:26,572
...当时机合适,当你开始行动.
...and then when the time's right, that's when you make your move.

813
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,652
让我兴奋了.开始感觉到.
Get my blood pumping. Start to feel it.

814
00:50:30,020 --> 00:50:31,453
让你兴奋!
Get your blood pumping!

815
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:34,134
让我们兴奋.开始吧.
Let's get excited. Let's make it happen.

816
00:50:34,300 --> 00:50:37,656
来吧,大人物.然后告诉我你不知道.
Come on, big guy. Turn around and show me what you don't know.

817
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:41,893
没错.好的.这看.继续,宝贝.
That's it. Okay. That's one way to look at it. Keep moving it, baby.

818
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:45,211
没错.保持开机.没有规则.我喜欢.你让它发生.
That's it. Keep rolling. There's no rules. I like it. You're making it happen.

819
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,214
你在跳舞.没关系,不好,好!
You're dancing. That's okay, and it's not okay, and it's okay!

820
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,259
感觉!跟着它.
Feel it! Stay with it.

821
00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:07,698
风的.我喜欢!热的.加油!坚持住,哥哥!
Wind it up. I like it! Heat it up. Work it harder! Stay with it, brother!

822
00:51:25,180 --> 00:51:26,852
哦,我忘了我的手套.
Oh, I forgot my gloves.

823
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,210
没关系.起来平静地.
It's okay. Just get up calmly.

824
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:40,133
没关系...
That's all right...

825
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,739
威利!
Willie!

826
00:51:55,500 --> 00:51:56,979
你摔倒了,没什么大不了的.
So you fell down, big deal.

827
00:51:57,140 --> 00:52:00,974
fred,不是每个人都掉在他的脸上.
Fred, not everybody falls down on his face in front of the girl he loves.

828
00:52:01,140 --> 00:52:04,416
我看起来像个白痴那里.
I looked like a total idiot out there.

829
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,652
我不会露面了?太荒谬了.
How am I ever gonna be seen in public again? It's ridiculous.

830
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:11,415
谢天谢地blitzen不觉得他第一次学会飞行.
Thank goodness Blitzen didn't feel that way the first time he learned how to fly.

831
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:14,578
当blitzen学会f…..?我知道这个故事吗?
When Blitzen learned to f...? Why don't I know this story?

832
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:17,334
哦,这样,威利.每个人都知道这个故事.
Oh, come off it, Willie. Everyone knows this story.

833
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,612
-blitzen学会飞行吗?他脸上.
- When Blitzen learned to fly? - He fell on his face.

834
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,652
是吗?-他会试图去了...是的.
- He did? - He'd try and take a run... Yeah.

835
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,697
他跑他摔他的脸.
He'd run and he'd fall flat on his face.

836
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,170
但他自己和他会继续努力.
But he picked himself up and he'd keep trying.

837
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,730
最终,他想他飞起来了.
And eventually, he stopped thinking and he flew.

838
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,217
-是常识的.-fred,快点.
- It's common knowledge. - Fred, come on.

839
00:52:34,380 --> 00:52:36,769
-是真的.-我不是blitzen,不过.我不是blitzen.
- It's true. - I'm not Blitzen, though. I'm no Blitzen.

840
00:52:36,940 --> 00:52:38,498
嗯,我同意你,威利.
Well, I disagree with you, Willie.

841
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,574
我知道你在你的blitzen.
I know you got more Blitzen in you than you realize.

842
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,412
爱情很复杂.
Love is so complicated.

843
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,853
是的,不.
Yeah, can be.

844
00:52:50,220 --> 00:52:51,255
好痛.
It hurts.

845
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,214
我为你骄傲,威利.
I'm proud of you, Willie.

846
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,054
现在,晚安.
Now, good night.

847
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:00,459
晚安,fred.
Good night, Fred.

848
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:29,215
哦,fred.哦,哪里,哦,哪儿都不信吗?
Oh, Fred. Oh, where, oh, where did all the kids' letters go?

849
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,933
哦,不是很好吗?露西要做饭了.
Oh, isn't that sweet? Lucy wants a cooking set.

850
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:40,456
嗯,这是你做意大利面,亲爱的.这只是个开始.
Well, here's how you make pasta, darling. There's a start.

851
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:46,579
哦,小基南亚当斯要自行车圣诞节.
Oh, little Keenan Adams wants a bike for Christmas.

852
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,891
嗯,基南,我猜你会坐公车上学的.
Well, Keenan, I guess you'll be taking the bus to school from now on.

853
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:56,131
哦,freddie,freddie,你已经非常,非常调皮.
<i>Oh, Freddie, Freddie, you have been</i> <i>so very, very naughty.</i>

854
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:03,216
我没带任何文件出去.我不要这个了.
I didn't take any of the files out of the room. I never got to the S's.

855
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,417
fred,我不需要告诉你很重要的文件了.
Fred, I don't need to tell you how very important these files are.

856
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:11,015
没有,我们不知道孩子们的.
Without them, we have no idea what the children want.

857
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,250
或者他们已经盯上还是不错的.
Or whether they've been marked Naughty or Nice.

858
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,696
这是你的责任,当然,记录的.
And it was your responsibility, of course, to keep track of them.

859
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:20,449
我告诉你,我知道我…..我没带钱...怎么了?
I just told you, I would know if l... I didn't take any... What is going on here?

860
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,772
你站在那儿评判我胳膊折了?
And why are you standing there judging me with your arms folded?

861
00:54:23,940 --> 00:54:25,578
我不是在评判你,我很紧张.
I'm not judging you, I'm nervous.

862
00:54:25,740 --> 00:54:29,130
我也很紧张我并非善类.谁最祈求示威.
I'd be nervous too if I was up to no good. Doth who protests the most.

863
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:31,131
-你能相信吗?-好的.快点.
- Can you believe this guy? - Okay. Come on.

864
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,609
-我看着你,鲍勃.-是吗?什么,大家伙.
- I got my eye on you, Bob. - Yeah? Anytime, big fella.

865
00:54:33,780 --> 00:54:34,769
bob,安静.
Bob, settle down.

866
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,454
你想说一个精灵,你必须像精灵.
You wanna talk like an elf, you have to act like an elf.

867
00:54:37,620 --> 00:54:39,019
-很容易找到.-谈谈.
- I'm easy to find. - Big talk.

868
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,410
他比你大到,鲍勃.
He's got a bigger reach than you, Bob.

869
00:54:46,060 --> 00:54:48,130
-麻烦?-不,不,不.
- Trouble? - No, no, no.

870
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,895
没有?没人在威斯康星州会得到礼物了!
No? Nobody in Wisconsin's gonna get any gifts this year!

871
00:54:56,100 --> 00:54:58,898
哦,我,我的.那些可怜的孩子.
Oh, my, my. Those poor children.

872
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,255
你没有后备的?
You don't have any backup records?

873
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,130
嗯,我们从来没有这样的.
Well, we've never had something like this happen.

874
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:08,452
我肯定他们会出现.我是说,毕竟,他们可能了?
I'm sure that they'll turn up. I mean, after all, where could they have possibly gone?

875
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:11,657
失败的管理后援.
Failure to administrate backup records.

876
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:12,935
那两好球.
That would be strike two.

877
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:17,056
听着,这可能是我...
Look, this is probably none of my business...

878
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,529
...但我有点担心fred.
...but I'm a little concerned about Fred.

879
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:24,134
嗯,我感谢你的关心,northcutt先生,但他很好.
Well, I appreciate your concern, Mr. Northcutt, but he is fine.

880
00:55:24,300 --> 00:55:27,849
我见过这种东西.小谎言...
It's just that I've seen these kind of things before. The little lies...

881
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:29,734
...闪光愤怒的.
...flashes of anger.

882
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,416
不,我可以向你保证,他没事.
No, I can assure you, he's fine.

883
00:55:33,620 --> 00:55:36,418
嗯,不过可能会更糟,圣诞老人.
Well, but it could get so much worse, Santa.

884
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:39,697
告诉我,他要大的钱吗?
Tell me, has he asked for large sums of money recently?

885
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:42,579
什么麻烦?
And what about trouble?

886
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,250
他进了问题吗?
Has he gotten into trouble with the law?

887
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,775
为什么,是的,northcutt先生,是的,他.
Why, yes, Mr. Northcutt, yes, he has.

888
00:55:47,940 --> 00:55:51,979
当然.他是为了帮助.
Of course. He's crying out for help.

889
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,415
如果没有人去帮他,为什么...
And if someone doesn't step in and help him, why...

890
00:55:54,580 --> 00:55:56,411
...我会的.
...I'm afraid it's gonna get ugly.

891
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,578
嗯,我能怎么办,northcutt先生吗?
Well, what can I do, Mr. Northcutt?

892
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,934
我有个想法.但你不会喜欢的.
I did have a thought. But Fred's not going to like it.

893
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,335
什么样的派对你兄弟吗?
What kind of party are you dudes throwing?

894
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:26,295
航空!航空邮件给我!让我们兴奋!
Airmail it! Airmail it to me right now! Let's get jacked up!

895
00:57:06,180 --> 00:57:10,014
你怎么了,疯了?我觉得pattyhearst!我只是绑架,nick!
What are you, nuts? I feel like Patty Hearst! I was just abducted, Nick!

896
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:11,818
你要付钱的...
You're gonna have to pay something...

897
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,136
...为那伤害我有我的内心.
...to make up for the hurt I have inside of me.

898
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,179
不会的.我有个律师有元音的姓,尼克.
It's not gonna be cheap. I got a lawyer that's got vowels in his last name, Nick.

899
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:23,016
他会联系你,让你伤害我的人!
He's gonna contact you and make you feel the hurt I feel from your handlers!

900
00:57:23,180 --> 00:57:25,774
弗来德利克!我们正在一家人了.
Frederick! We're having a family intervention.

901
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:28,500
你的行为已经接受.
Your behavior has been unacceptable.

902
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:35,577
-wanda,嗨.-嗨.你还好吗?
- Wanda, hi. - Hi. You all right?

903
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,857
我很好.我很好.你怎么样?
I'm doing terrific. I'm doing great. How've you been?

904
00:57:39,020 --> 00:57:42,057
你知道,我很好.是的,我一直在和...
You know, I've been all right. Yeah, I've been working and...

905
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,452
太棒了.是对人做他们做的.
That's awesome. Work is really good for someone to do when they're doing stuff.

906
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,930
我一直在工作,也,对了.也为我的生活.
I've been working a lot, too, by the way. And also fighting for my life.

907
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,930
我弟弟是圣诞老人.
My brother's Santa Claus.

908
00:57:56,300 --> 00:57:59,098
是的,是的.我可以...我知道.
Yeah, yeah. I can... I can see that.

909
00:57:59,260 --> 00:58:02,457
有点不同.
It's a little different.

910
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,054
是的,整件事是有点不寻常.
Yeah, the whole thing's been a little bit unusual.

911
00:58:05,540 --> 00:58:08,737
fred,你哥哥的人我们想帮你.
Fred, your brother has flown someone in we think can help you.

912
00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:11,011
-这是goldfarb了.-你好.
- This is Dr. Goldfarb. - Hello.

913
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,172
你行为异常要太多压力了.
Your erratic behavior is putting too much stress on your brother.

914
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:18,128
妈妈,拜托,好吧,我没紧张的.
Mom, for Pete's sake, okay, I'm not stressed out about it.

915
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,131
-尼克!你会崩溃的.-我不是.
- Nick! You're falling apart. - I am not.

916
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,256
是的,你.你处境超重.
Yes, you are. You're dangerously overweight.

917
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:23,569
他不是!
He is not!

918
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,300
你不知道你儿子过去!
You have no idea what your son is going through!

919
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,974
-好的.-他是个可怕的衣橱.
- Okay. - He is a terrible closet eater.

920
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,450
他已经胃酸逆流而睡眠的.
He has developed acid reflux and sleep apnea.

921
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:35,578
-我打鼾.我是说,人们打鼾.-是他的...
- I snore. I mean, people snore. - It is keeping him up all night...

922
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:39,289
...这会影响他的健康,还有其他方面的婚姻.
...and it's affecting his health, not to mention other aspects of our marriage.

923
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:40,609
哦,哦,哦,安妮特.
Oh, ho, ho, Annette.

924
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,896
他在时间上吗?
He's having a tough time getting off the ground?

925
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:45,729
我只是说.
I'm just saying.

926
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:48,418
请,咱们别拐弯抹角了.
Please, let's just cut to the chase.

927
00:58:48,580 --> 00:58:51,048
很简单,总是一样,fred.
It's simple, it's always the same thing with you, Fred.

928
00:58:51,660 --> 00:58:53,491
-你惹麻烦.-亲爱的...
- You cause problems. - Sweetie...

929
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,928
然后你借口...
And then you make excuses...

930
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:57,853
...比如,你知道,你是关心别人.
...like, you know, you're looking out for someone else.

931
00:58:58,020 --> 00:58:59,419
自从小时候.
Ever since he was a little boy.

932
00:58:59,580 --> 00:59:02,970
如果我说会更好.freddie,那叫你做什么.
I couldn't have said it any better. Freddie, that is what you do.

933
00:59:03,140 --> 00:59:06,371
太好了.帮我个忙,拜托.你为什么不离开这?
That's great. Do me a favor, please. Why don't you just stay out of this?

934
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:09,008
嗯,我是在干涉.你问我.
Well, I came for the intervention. Your family asked me.

935
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:11,933
你没有和一个人忘记堵他计吗?
Don't you have a date with a guy who forgot to plug his meter?

936
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,658
你在监视我吗?
Have you been spying on me?

937
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:15,458
是的.-你有其他事情要做?
- Yes. - You got nothing better to do?

938
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:18,259
-我不喜欢我看到的.-如果你监视我的...
- I don't like what I saw. - If you spied on me properly...

939
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:21,139
...你知道我没和他.
...you would know I didn't end up going out with that guy.

940
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:24,736
这么说你.这不是漂亮的角色...
Let me just say this to you. It is not flattering on your character...

941
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:27,334
...你那个有liver-spotted手.
...to see you with a man who's got liver-spotted hands.

942
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:29,809
这是一个很弱的选择.那样会让你显得弱势.
It's a very weak choice. It makes you look weak.

943
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:31,857
听着,我可以告诉你你的问题.
Look, I can tell you what your problem is.

944
00:59:32,020 --> 00:59:35,376
你不想让别人喜欢你因为你不认为你值得爱.
You won't let anybody love you because you don't think you're worth loving.

945
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,689
出庭作证...
If it pleases the court...

946
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,374
...你的老绅士问你约会?
...did you have an older gentleman ask you out on a date?

947
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:42,054
是的,但那不是重点!我没看到他了!
Yes, but that's not the point! I didn't see him again!

948
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:44,575
-她是个约会男人.-你和谁好了.
- Then she's a dater. - You push and fix on one thing.

949
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:46,458
别再约会.放下电话.
Then stop dating. Put down the phone.

950
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:48,099
没错.我受够了.
That's it. I've had enough.

951
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:52,094
对不起,圣诞老人先生.很高兴到北极...
Excuse me, Mr. Santa Claus. It's been very pleasant to come to the North Pole...

952
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,818
...还有,是的.
...and, yeah.

953
00:59:53,980 --> 00:59:56,619
去约会.也许侥幸精灵了.
Go find a date. Maybe get lucky with an elf on the way out.

954
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,133
祝你好运.希望一切顺利.
Good luck. Hope it goes well.

955
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:01,497
嗯,有很多槲寄生外面,你应该感到兴奋的.
Well, there's a lot of mistletoe out there, so you should be psyched.

956
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:02,729
fred.
Fred.

957
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:07,137
我想我们的进展.
I think we're making some real progress.

958
01:00:07,300 --> 01:00:10,929
你知道好消息是什么吗?明天是最后一天.
You wanna know what the good news is about all of this? Tomorrow's my last day.

959
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:12,613
我们不需要治疗.
We don't have to have therapy.

960
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:16,819
找人在生活中.我们没这种问题.
It's for people who want to be in each other's lives. We don't have that problem.

961
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,892
我会完成我的工作,我会永远.
I'm gonna finish my job, I'll be out of your lives forever.

962
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:32,375
晚安.
Nice night.

963
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:35,179
迷路,家伙.
Get lost, guy.

964
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:40,135
圣诞老人是兄弟,那一定很累了.
Santa Claus' brother, that must be a tough beat.

965
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,975
我弟弟是个医生.我从来没听说过.
My brother's a doctor. I never hear the end of it.

966
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:45,700
一半的时间,我觉得我根本不存在.
Half the time, I feel like I don't even exist.

967
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:48,135
和你的家人对你.
And the way your whole family treats you.

968
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,858
你的故事,伙计?
What's your story, man?

969
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,449
什么?
Excuse me?

970
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:56,571
听着,你想对我没用.
Look, whatever you're trying to do with me here's not gonna work.

971
01:00:56,740 --> 01:00:58,856
嗯,告诉我吗?
Well, what exactly am I trying?

972
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:03,059
我不知道你在做什么,但真正的你...
I don't know what it is you're into, but something's real creepy about you...

973
01:01:03,220 --> 01:01:04,733
...自从你来...
...and ever since you got here...

974
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,130
...我哥哥有点紧张.
...my brother's been getting a little bit nervous.

975
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:08,699
太好了.
That's wonderful.

976
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,288
是啊?
What is wonderful?

977
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:13,690
你感兴趣你哥哥的功用.
You take an interest in your brother's well-being.

978
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:16,169
当然.我确定他也一样保护你.
Of course you do. I'm sure he does the same for you.

979
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,773
-克莱德...-你见过树...
- Clyde... - You ever seen a tree...

980
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:19,931
...它的阴影里另一棵树?
...that grows in the shadow of another tree?

981
01:01:20,100 --> 01:01:23,536
好瘦和畸形只是弯曲和扭曲了...
It's all puny and misshapen because it's just bending and twisting...

982
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,373
...在他们有阳光.
...trying so desperately to get some sunlight.

983
01:01:27,180 --> 01:01:30,650
如果有人把几个英尺的大树...
If somebody just cut off a few feet of that big tree...

984
01:01:30,820 --> 01:01:32,617
...小树会长大的.
...that little tree could grow up strong.

985
01:01:32,780 --> 01:01:35,214
但,那不是生活在,对吗?
But no, that's not the way life works, right?

986
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:38,852
他们都喜欢那树,对吗?他们都为那个.
They all love that big tree, right? They're all proud of that one.

987
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:41,534
他们讨厌的小旁边.
They hate the crap out of the little one next to it.

988
01:01:42,340 --> 01:01:45,093
小树拒绝长大的.
The little tree that refuses to grow right.

989
01:01:45,620 --> 01:01:48,930
你知道吗?直到有人过来切下来大树...
And you know what? Till somebody comes along and cuts down that big tree...

990
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:52,729
...那是不会有光.有光.
...that little tree is never gonna get any light. Any light.

991
01:01:57,260 --> 01:01:59,535
对不起.我不知道哪里来的.
I'm sorry. I don't know where that came from.

992
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,288
圣诞节.
Christmas.

993
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,779
有个愉快的晚上.
Have a nice night.

994
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,538
那是什么?
What the hell was that?

995
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:27,052
像个孩子就在第一最下流的地方.
Looks like a new kid just took over the number one Most Naughty spot.

996
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:33,615
放纵的?
Slam?

997

你每淘气的孩子好!
You marked every naughty child as nice!

1020

你疯了吗?
Are you out of your mind?

我们不会和礼物只有三天了.
We literally cannot make enough presents with only three days left.

1024

我觉得这个吧.我不希望我弟弟会成功.
And I feel this way all the time. It's not like I didn't want my brother to succeed.

1084
01:11:29,540 --> 01:11:32,657
我们很近了.我是说,我们上下铺.
We were very close growing up. I mean, we shared bunk beds.

"You're gonna support your brother." And so that was gonna be my job.

And then <i>Rocky</i> came out, and things changed, you know?

1089

我是第一个人排队.我是说,我.
I was the first guy in line. I mean, I was there.

1090
01:11:48,420 --> 01:11:50,854
当洛基我出来...
And then when <i>Rocky III</i> came out...

1091
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:53,739
...我开始怀疑谁是弗兰克硬气,你知道吗?
...I was starting to wonder who Frank Stallone was, you know?

1092
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,413
是,比如,窃取身份.
It was, like, identity theft.

1093
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,810
你兰博和你在洛基...

1094
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:01,211

1098
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:14,135
好的.现在,我们去吧.

我有些东西我想谈谈如果...
I actually have some things I'd like to talk about if...

1100

好吧,你要排队.
Okay, you're just gonna have to wait your turn.

1101
01:12:20,220 --> 01:12:23,849
罗杰等,我们没有把他上次,那我们去吧.
Roger's been waiting, and we didn't get to him last time, so we'll go to Roger.

1107
01:12:38,140 --> 01:12:40,608
我弟弟是美国总统.
My brother was the president of the United States.

1108
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,693
你知道,我讨厌的电视频道...
You know, I was flipping through the channels on the TV...

...and on the History Channel was the State of the Union Address from 1993.

01:12:49,180 --> 01:12:54,129
当我们离开白宫,我以为…恢复.
When we left the White House, I thought it was gonna be the first step to recovery.

1111
01:12:54,740 --> 01:12:58,050
但,我开始哭了.
But no, I started to cry again.

1112
01:12:58,780 --> 01:13:04,093
我只是不知道我,你知道,能完全恢复了.
And I just don't know if I'm ever, you know, gonna be able to fully recover now.

1113
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:07,570
也许是个地方我可以的,我们是怎么了.
Maybe that's a place where I could jump in, share what's going on with me.

1114

我是说,因为这不好玩了成员.
I mean, because this isn't funny to all of us here in the group.

1126
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:46,897
好吧,这是非常严重的.
Okay, this is very serious to us.

1127
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:50,575
我感觉很不舒服你从哪儿来的.
And I'm feeling very uncomfortable with where you're coming from.

1128
01:13:50,740 --> 01:13:52,810
等等,stephen...
Wait, Stephen...

1129
01:13:52,980 --> 01:13:56,211
...也许他,他弟弟是圣诞老人.
...maybe to him, his brother is Santa Claus.

1130
01:13:56,420 --> 01:13:57,978
觉得我哥哥圣诞老人.
Feel like my brother's Santa Claus.

1131
01:13:58,140 --> 01:14:02,213
但我觉得我哥哥圣诞老人因为我哥哥是圣诞老人.
But I feel like my brother's Santa Claus because my brother really is Santa Claus.

1132
01:14:02,380 --> 01:14:05,053
好吧,够了,好!你和我有问题!
All right, that's enough, all right! You and I got a problem!

1133
01:14:05,580 --> 01:14:09,095
stephen,放松,放松.好的.stephen,放松.
Stephen, easy, easy. All right. Stephen, easy.

1134
01:14:10,420 --> 01:14:12,775
这不是亚历克,好吗?
That's not Alec, okay?

1135
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:14,612
别看我,看看他.
Don't look at me, look at him.

1136
01:14:15,700 --> 01:14:16,894
这不是艾力克.
That's not Alec.

1137
01:14:17,220 --> 01:14:18,369
这不是艾力克.
That's not Alec.

1138
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:20,691
我不是亚历克,你知道我的意思吗?
I'm not Alec, you know what I mean?

1139
01:14:20,860 --> 01:14:22,418
好吧,我们踩了.
All right, let's stomp it out.

1140
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:24,377
-艾力克.-亚历克不会听到的.
- It's not Alec. - Alec's not gonna hear.

1141
01:14:24,540 --> 01:14:25,575
他会的...?
How's he gonna...?

1142
01:14:25,780 --> 01:14:28,089
-艾力克.-好吧,这不是艾力克.
- That's not Alec. - Okay, that's not Alec.

1143
01:14:28,260 --> 01:14:30,137
-阿!-阿!
- That's not Alec! - That's not Alec!

1144
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:32,650
-阿!-好!
- That's not Alec! - All right!

1145
01:14:32,820 --> 01:14:36,779
现在你有alec注意,stephen,你要告诉他吗?
Now that you've got Alec's attention, Stephen, what do you wanna tell him?

1146
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:42,136
stephen,我知道你是从哪里来的...
Stephen, I think I know where you're coming from...

1147
01:14:42,300 --> 01:14:45,019
...因为我以前真的,是对我弟弟.
...because I used to be really, really angry with my brother.

1148
01:14:45,580 --> 01:14:50,176
我不想成为第一个兄弟,尤其是一辈子.
I didn't want to become first brother, especially for the rest of my life.

1149
01:14:50,340 --> 01:14:53,810
我不能控制我的美国总统.
I couldn't control being brother of the president of the United States.

1150
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,417
但我可以控制被billclinton兄弟.
But I could control being Bill Clinton's brother.

1151
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:01,016
我决定了,即使我可以把房子...
And I made the decision, even though I could have brought the house down...

1152
01:15:01,180 --> 01:15:04,695
...我决定了,我的兄弟...
...I made the decision that, for the love of my brother...

1153
01:15:04,860 --> 01:15:07,328
...而我的名字...
...and for the love of my family name...

1154
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:10,370
...我会不择手段的...

1155
01:15:11,460 --> 01:15:13,496
...因为我爱我弟弟...

...我总是能给我哥哥.我有.

And you know what?

1158
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:21,219

01:15:26,980 --> 01:15:28,618
旅行专家吗?
The Travel Experts?

Yeah. I need to get to the North Pole right away, like, tonight.

1161
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:36,298

Yeah, I got $50,000 in cash that says I'm not kidding.

1162
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:58,532
-哦,北极!北极的.-北极吗?
- Oh, North Pole! North Pole. - North Pole is there?

1167
01:16:41,500 --> 01:16:42,774
fred,是圣诞夜.
Fred, it's Christmas Eve.

1168
01:16:42,940 --> 01:16:48,014
这不可能.我们建那么多的玩具了.
It's impossible. We just can't build that many toys in that time.

1169
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,694
规则说每个孩子的玩具.
The rule says that every kid gets a toy.

1170
01:16:50,860 --> 01:16:54,933
那么,什么最让玩具?一个男孩一个女孩.
So, what would be the easiest toy to make? One for boys and one for girls.

1171
01:16:55,100 --> 01:16:57,216
-球棒.-呼拉圈.
- A baseball bat. - A Hula-Hoop.

1172
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,894
嗯,棒球和hula-hoops是,那么.
Well, baseball bats and Hula-Hoops it is, then.

1173
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:04,134
charlene,你认为我们能多给我们配额?
Charlene, do you think it's possible we can make enough gifts to meet our quota?

1174
01:17:04,300 --> 01:17:07,292
棒球,输了4秒, 55...
Baseball bats, lose four seconds, 55...

1175
01:17:08,940 --> 01:17:10,931
是的,这是有可能的.
Yeah, it is possible.

1176
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:14,257
是,但是,fred,那不是孩子了.
It is, but, Fred, that's not what the kids asked for.

1177
01:17:14,540 --> 01:17:17,737
是的,但重要的是这孩子的玩具.
Yeah, but all that matters is that each of the kids get a toy.

1178
01:17:17,900 --> 01:17:21,779
他们有他们可以打开他们早上醒来了.
That they have something that they can open when they wake up in the morning.

1179
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:25,774
最重要的是,他们都知道有人想他们.
Most importantly, they all know there's somebody who's thinking about them.

1180
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:29,573
你们从没想过圣诞.
You guys have never missed a Christmas before.

1181
01:17:30,380 --> 01:17:33,099
如果你们要走了...
If you guys are gonna go out this year...

1182
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:36,736
...你要走了.
...you're gonna go out trying.

1183
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:57,731
好的.我们到了.
Okay. We're on it.

1184
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:00,651
-我从没见过他...-因为他是…..
- I've never seen him... - That's because he's...

1185
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:03,334
...扔他出去了.-没有.
...thrown his back out. - No.

1186
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,695
-嘿,annette,你好吗?-fred.
- Hey, Annette, how you doing? - Fred.

1187
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:09,495
nick,我想我们会成功的.我在工作室精灵做礼物.
Nick, I think we're gonna make it. I got elves in the Workshop making presents.

1188
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:11,855
我们也,但我想我们能成功.
We're cutting corners, but I think we can make it.

1189
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:15,057
你还能拯救了圣诞节.我们没有时间了.
You'll still be able to save Christmas. We don't have a lot of time.

1190
01:18:15,220 --> 01:18:18,690
那不可能.他不能继续他的体重.
That's impossible. The man can hardly carry his own weight.

1191
01:18:18,900 --> 01:18:20,652
我动不了.
I can't move.

1192
01:18:22,860 --> 01:18:24,816
我不能,fred.
I can't, Fred.

1193
01:18:25,900 --> 01:18:27,652
你能做到的.是圣诞节,快点.
You can do it. It's Christmas, come on.

1194
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,893
-孩子们,靠我们.-哦,孩子,我希望我可以.
- The kids are out there, counting on us. - Oh, boy, I wish I could.

1195
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:36,698
威利,这是你的大日子.这是你的夜晚,伙计.
Willie, this is your big night. This is your big night, pal.

1196
01:18:36,860 --> 01:18:38,930
你会送礼物.威利能.
You're gonna deliver the presents. Willie can.

1197
01:18:39,100 --> 01:18:40,772
不,fred,我不能.
No, Fred, I can't.

1198
01:18:40,940 --> 01:18:43,010
当然可以.你很不错那雪橇.
Of course you can. You're great on that sleigh.

1199
01:18:43,180 --> 01:18:46,138
不,不,你不明白.我做不到.这是规矩.
No, no, you don't understand. I can't do it. There's a rule.

1200
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:49,417
只有一个圣诞老人给的礼物.
Only a Claus can deliver the presents.

1201
01:18:59,740 --> 01:19:02,857
你们让我单独跟我弟弟来了吗?
Do you guys mind giving me just a moment alone with my brother here?

1202
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:10,689
是的.
Yeah.

1203
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:16,978
我做不到,尼克.我想你知道.
I can't do that, Nick. I think you know that.

1204
01:19:19,740 --> 01:19:23,130
我做不到.我不喜欢坐飞机...
I'm not capable. I'm not even comfortable flying...

1205
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,894
...或是一个乘客,让人想飞雪橇.
...or being a passenger, let alone trying to fly the sleigh.

1206
01:19:26,060 --> 01:19:28,654
-我不知道我周围驯鹿...-嘿,fred.
- I don't know my way around reindeer... - Hey, Fred.

1207
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,573
没关系.
It's all right.

1208
01:19:33,140 --> 01:19:37,179
太荒谬了别人的期望.不.
It's ridiculous for anybody to expect that kind of thing. No.

1209
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,896
你不能这么做.你不能.
You can't do that. You can't.

1210
01:19:40,980 --> 01:19:43,778
太大了.相信我,我知道.
It's too huge. Believe me, I know.

1211
01:19:48,980 --> 01:19:51,574
我不会让你这么做,fred.
And I would never ask you to do that, Fred.

1212
01:19:53,820 --> 01:19:55,651
没关系.
It's all right.

1213
01:19:55,820 --> 01:19:57,492
没什么.
It is all right.

1214
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,815
nick,有一件事一直在我已经.
Nick, there's been one thing that's been eating at me since I've been here.

1215
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,894
那naughty-nice名单了?
That Naughty-Nice List that you got?

1216
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,736
没有淘气的孩子,尼克.
There's no naughty kids, Nick.

1217
01:20:23,500 --> 01:20:24,979
他们都是好孩子.
They're all good kids.

1218
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,531
但有些害怕.
But some of them are scared.

1219
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:29,930
而他们不想听的.
And some of them don't feel listened to.

1220
01:20:30,140 --> 01:20:32,779
他们有一些很难了.
Some of them had some pretty tough breaks too.

1221
01:20:35,660 --> 01:20:38,379
每个孩子都该在圣诞礼物.
But every kid deserves a present on Christmas.

1222
01:21:15,460 --> 01:21:17,416
是的.
Yeah.

1223
01:21:31,140 --> 01:21:35,691
亚洲,非洲加上,加上欧洲,北美,南美.
Africa plus Asia, plus Europe, North America, South America.

1224
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:37,179
很接近了.
It's gonna be close.

1225
01:21:37,340 --> 01:21:39,331
我们走,人们!我们跟上节奏!
Let's go, people! Let's pick up the pace!

1226
01:21:51,820 --> 01:21:55,335
红fred已进入大楼.重复,红fred已进入大楼.
Red Fred has entered the building. I repeat, Red Fred has entered the building.

1227
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:57,650
威利,我们走.
Willie, let's go.

1228
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:13,214
发生什么吗?小精灵.你不能信任他们!
What the heck's going on around here? Little elves. You can't trust them at all!

1229
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:14,415
小的.
The little tiny people.

1230
01:22:16,780 --> 01:22:19,135
装备不错.怎么你以为你在干什么?
Nice outfit. What the heck do you think you're doing?

1231
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,779
-送的礼物.-哦,不.
- Delivering presents. - Oh, no.

1232
01:22:20,940 --> 01:22:22,692
圣诞老人是唯一能做到.
Santa is the only one who can deliver.

1233
01:22:22,860 --> 01:22:25,328
只有一个圣诞老人能送礼物是克劳斯.
Only a Claus can deliver presents and that is a Claus.

1234
01:22:25,740 --> 01:22:29,289
如果你认为我会让你侥幸逃脱,你错了.
If you think I'm gonna let you get away with this, you are sadly mistaken.

1235
01:22:29,740 --> 01:22:32,698
如果你不闪开的雪橇3秒...
If you don't get out of the way of this sleigh in three seconds...

1236
01:22:32,860 --> 01:22:34,771
...我会幸福在北极.
...I'll be the happiest guy in the North Pole.

1237
01:22:34,940 --> 01:22:37,056
你没这个胆量.
You don't have the guts.

1238
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:38,369
好的.
Okay.

1239
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:40,938
三...
Three...

1240
01:22:41,260 --> 01:22:42,659
...两个...
...two...

1241
01:22:42,820 --> 01:22:44,697
-willie,我怎么做吗?-说啊.
- Willie, how do I do this? - Just say "ho."

1242

- Good, Fred! Nice firm grip on those reins! - What's happening now?

1243
01:22:53,940 --> 01:22:57,410
放松缰绳,我们得把这个东西!告诉那些人去!
Snap those reins, we gotta get this thing in the air! Tell the guys to get up!

1244
01:22:57,580 --> 01:22:58,569
起来,起来,起来!
Get up, get up, get up!

1245
01:23:00,660 --> 01:23:03,572
去你的!是,弗莱德!我们走!
There you go! You got it, Fred! We're going up!

1246
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,529
-你在圣诞老人的雪橇!-我们在飞.出了什么事吗?
- You're flying Santa's sleigh! - We're flying. Now what's happening?

1247
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,418
-屋顶的.-我做不到!
- Watch the roof there. - I can't do it!

1248
01:23:12,460 --> 01:23:14,371
给我,我怎么驾驶这玩意?
Do it to me, how do I steer this thing?

1249
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:17,577
我们走!你得把我拉上去,弗莱德!
We wanna go up! So you gotta pull up on the reins there, Fred!

1250
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:19,173

我想我们要瞎了.

1324
01:29:16,940 --> 01:29:20,171
-你怎么会记得吗?-你问我是超人的.
- How could you possibly remember that? - You asked me for a Superman cape.

1325
01:29:21,540 --> 01:29:24,054
但我没给你个超人角,是吗?
But I didn't give you a Superman cape, did I?

1326
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:31,449
-你总是戴眼镜,克莱德?-如果你认为这会改变什么...
- Did you always wear glasses, Clyde? - If you think this changes anything...

Oh, and do you think that after a while of being called Four-Eyed Clyde...

1330

...你也许有点生气?
...you maybe got a little angry?

1331
01:29:42,740 --> 01:29:46,415
也许你打架了.10,也许12.
Maybe you started a fight or two. Maybe 10, maybe 12.

一个超人的.
A Superman cape.

1334
01:29:54,220 --> 01:29:57,212
你认为这会改变一切.
Because you thought that that was gonna change everything.

1335
01:29:57,380 --> 01:29:58,369
这太荒谬了.
This is ridiculous.

1336
01:29:58,540 --> 01:30:01,737
-所以你决定留下four-eyed克莱德?-因为克拉克・肯特戴眼镜!
- So you decide to stay Four-Eyed Clyde? - Because Clark Kent wore glasses!

但是当他变成超人...

...他不需要那些该死的眼镜了,是吗?

1339
01:30:10,340 --> 01:30:12,092
哦,克莱德.
Oh, Clyde.

1340
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:17,257
我给你的礼物,克莱德.
It was wrong of me not to give you that gift, Clyde.

1341
01:30:17,420 --> 01:30:21,572
我怕有个非常错误...
I fear that I had a very incorrect...

1343
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:27,419
...顽皮的孩子.
...naughty children.

1344
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:34,175
这可能有点晚了.
So this may be a little late.

1345
01:30:48,660 --> 01:30:49,695
你想穿上吗?
You wanna put it on?

1357
01:31:39,500 --> 01:31:41,934
我要你回来了,超人.
I'm gonna need you to turn the power back on, Superman.

1358
01:31:43,660 --> 01:31:45,730
现在,我知道你能做到的.
Now, I know that you can do this.

1359
01:31:45,900 --> 01:31:49,575
你得明白,我已经递交了报告.是的.
You have to understand, I've already submitted my report. It's final.

I understand that. I do.

1363

但是我们给他了?

1364
01:32:02,060 --> 01:32:04,335
因为他不是个坏孩子的.
Because he's not a naughty kid either.

1365
01:32:04,500 --> 01:32:05,694
我正在努力...等等!

1382
01:37:49,620 --> 01:37:50,894
你怎么进来的?
How'd you get in?

1383
01:37:51,060 --> 01:37:53,096
我来烟囱.
I came down the chimney.

1384
01:37:53,260 --> 01:37:56,138
freddie,你不能仅仅穿的像父亲圣诞节...
Freddie, you can't just show up dressed like Father Christmas...

1385
01:37:56,300 --> 01:37:58,291
...然后到别人的烟囱.
...and come down somebody else's chimney.

1386
01:37:58,460 --> 01:38:00,849
事实上,我可以.我一直在做的.
Actually, I can. I've been doing that all night.

1387
01:38:01,900 --> 01:38:05,688
freddie,你知道吗?我开始有点担心你,现在...
Freddie, do you know what? I'm starting to get a bit worried for you, right now...

1388
01:38:05,860 --> 01:38:09,933
...因为你站在这里,在我卧室,穿红色的.
...because like you're standing here, in my bedroom, wearing red.

1389
01:38:10,700 --> 01:38:13,817
还有,你知道,这是某种禁令时间.
And, you know, it's getting like to be sort of restraining order time.

1390
01:38:13,980 --> 01:38:16,574
那么,你看起来有点累了,我很累.
So, you look sort of tired and I know that I'm very tired.

1391
01:38:16,740 --> 01:38:20,176
也许我会打电话给你,但现在我觉得你该回家了.
So maybe I'll call you later, but right now I think you should just go home.

1392
01:38:20,340 --> 01:38:21,489
好吗?回家吧.
All right? Just go home.

1393
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,417
-我回家了.-你是什么?
- I am home. - You're what?

1394
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:28,255
我已经放弃了我租到公寓.我会在这儿陪你.
I've given up my lease on my apartment. I'm gonna be moving in here with you.

1395
01:38:28,620 --> 01:38:31,054
但是听着,慢慢来.我希望你能接受这个...
But listen, take your time. I want you to digest this...

1396
01:38:31,220 --> 01:38:33,654
...然后处理事情.我需要一些睡眠.
...and process things. I could use a little sleep.

1397
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:38,132
马上就在角落附近.我蜷缩着我们早餐角.
I'll be right out in our breakfast nook area. I'll be curled up in our breakfast nook.

1398
01:38:38,300 --> 01:38:41,258
当你准备好,你来找我,在我们家.
When you're ready, you come find me here at home, at our house.

1399
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:09,296
不妙.我们不能睡觉时我们会跟我们一起住.
This is no good. We can't go to bed when we're arguing now that we live together.

1400
01:39:18,380 --> 01:39:20,940
我有个惊喜要给你.
And I got a big surprise planned for you.

1401
01:39:21,300 --> 01:39:23,211
哦,不,freddie,一个大惊喜,拜托.
Oh, no, Freddie, not a big surprise, please.

1402
01:39:23,780 --> 01:39:26,738
我想你会改变主意你看到这个.
I think you're gonna change your mind when you see this one.

1403
01:39:33,980 --> 01:39:36,494
freddie,很好我们要做这个?
Freddie, is it all right that we're doing this?

1404

-这是公司的车.这是特权.-好的.
- It's a company car. It's one of the perks. - Okay.

1405
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:42,529
哦,freddie,难以置信.
Oh, Freddie, it's unbelievable.

1406

-我们在巴黎,宝贝.-我们在巴黎.
- We're in Paris, baby. - We're in Paris.

1407
01:39:48,820 --> 01:39:53,291
那么,你肯定想知道其他人怎么了.
<i>So, I bet you're wondering</i> <i>what happened to everyone else.</i>

1408
01:39:55,220 --> 01:39:59,372
那个圣诞节是最成功的.
<i>That Christmas turned out to be</i> <i>one of the most successful ever.</i>

1409

1422
