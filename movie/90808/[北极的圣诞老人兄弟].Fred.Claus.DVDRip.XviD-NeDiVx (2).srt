1
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:57,057
<i>You've probably heard</i>
<i>many stories that begin:</i>

2
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:01,736
<i>"A long, long time ago,</i>
<i>in a land far away. "</i>

3
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,131
<i>This one does as well.</i>

4
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,418
<i>But I assure you, this is a story</i>
<i>you have never heard before.</i>

5
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,889
<i>It's the story of a boy named Fred.</i>

6
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,050
<i>And it begins right here.</i>

7
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,179
It's time.

8
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,215
You must push, dear.

9
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,574
That's it.

10
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:24,777
That's it. One more time, come on. Yes.

11
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,608
What's wrong?

12
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,377
It's the fattest baby I've ever seen.

13
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,571
Good Lord.

14
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,772
Why does he not cry?

15
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,419
What did he say?

16
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,416
He's perfect in every way.

17
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,379
What shall we name him?

18
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,496
My father was called Nicholas.

19
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,175
Yes.

20
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,411
Nicholas Claus.

21
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,775
My Saint Nicholas.

22
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,973
Frederick.

23
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,334
Would you like to come
and meet your brother?

24
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,978
Come along now.

25
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,333
<i>Fred loved Nicholas</i>
<i>from the first moment he met him.</i>

26
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,095
<i>In fact, that day, he made him a promise.</i>

27
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:51,935
I promise to be the best big brother
in the whole world, Nicholas.

28
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,052
<i>But Fred's promise</i>
<i>is just the beginning of his story.</i>

29
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:02,212
<i>You see, sometimes it's easier</i>
<i>to make a promise...</i>

30
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,412
<i>... than it is to keep one.</i>

31
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,739
Time to cut the cake.

32
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:15,256
Here you go, Nicholas.
I made this for you.

33
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,773
Happy birthday.

34
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,818
- I thank you, Frederick.
- That was very nice, Frederick.

35
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,731
Nicholas, where are you going?

36
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,778
There's a poor orphan named Henry
who lives down the road.

37
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,137
I'm bringing all my gifts to him.
He needs them more than I.

38
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,574
That's lovely.

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:35,289
Do you really think Henry needs a journal
with the name "Nicholas" on the cover?

40
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,293
Frederick, it's a saintly thing he does.

41
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,770
My little Saint Nicholas.

42
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,729
<i>And so it went for Fred.</i>

43
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:49,379
<i>Every time he managed</i>
<i>to make his parents proud...</i>

44
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,371
Frederick, don't you look nice.

45
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,492
<i>... Nicholas managed</i>
<i>to make his parents prouder.</i>

46
00:03:56,660 --> 00:04:00,892
The door was locked, so I decided
to drop down the chimney! What fun!

47
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,375
Oh, Nicholas.

48
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,735
If the door was locked,
why didn't you just knock?

49
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,458
Because he's inventive.

50
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,656
I made the outfit myself, Mother.

51
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,738
I wouldn't go telling people that.

52
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:14,530
Really, Frederick, why can't you
be more like your brother?

53
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:28,091
I don't wish to hate him. He means well.

54
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,252
And I promised to be the best
big brother in the world.

55
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:35,098
You're the only one
who understands me, Chirp-Chirp.

56
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,737
Frederick!
I noticed how much you liked the tree...

57
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,529
...so now we're gonna bring it inside
the house and put presents under it!

58
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,053
Isn't that wonderful?

59
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,777
<i>Chirp-Chirp never returned.</i>

60
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,054
Frederick?

61
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,698
<i>Our poor Fred.</i>

62
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,293
Is this for me?

63
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,974
<i>That tree was the last straw.</i>

64
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,337
<i>He began to resent his brother,</i>
<i>his parents...</i>

65
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,099
<i>... and even his life.</i>

66
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,216
Nicholas, why don't you
open yours first?

67
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,292
Spin it. Spin it!

68
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,735
<i>And like many unhappy children...</i>

69
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,618
Why don't you open yours?

70
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,171
<i>... he became angry.</i>

71
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,331
<i>Naughty, even.</i>

72
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,419
I wonder what it is.

73
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,288
What's the matter, Nicholas?

74
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,409
Nothing.

75
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:05,137
<i>But while Fred grew worse...</i>

76
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,292
<i>... Nicholas grew more generous</i>
<i>and eventually...</i>

77
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,610
<i>... he fulfilled his mother's prophecy.</i>

78
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,489
<i>In manhood, he literally became a saint.</i>

79
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:18,975
<i>Now, it's a little-known rule of sainthood,</i>
<i>but when you become a saint...</i>

80
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,610
<i>... you freeze in time, eternally ageless.</i>

81
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:27,376
<i>The rule applies to the family</i>
<i>of the saint and the spouses, as well.</i>

82
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,897
<i>Now, you probably already have your</i>
<i>suspicions of what became of Saint Nick.</i>

83
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:36,531
<i>The world grew to know</i>
<i>and love him as Santa Claus.</i>

84
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:41,816
<i>But as I told you before,</i>
<i>this is a story about Fred.</i>

85
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,650
<i>And the next part of Fred's story</i>
<i>occurs in a time and place...</i>

86
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,050
<i>... that might be a little more</i>
<i>familiar to you.</i>

87
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,570
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

88
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,859
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

89
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:03,808
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

90
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,132
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves Christmas!</i>

91
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,013
You can't take my television!
I watch that in bed!

92
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,249
Are you nuts?

93
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:15,412
You can't just run up and kick
someone like that. How old are you?

94
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,093
- Nine.
- Nine?

95
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,455
And you have a 55-inch Plasma TV
in your room?

96
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,531
Santa got it for me
for Christmas last year.

97
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,294
The guy in the red suit's
not looking out for your future.

98
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,859
You're gonna get hooked on that.

99
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,454
I can see it now.
Sixteen thousand bags of Cheetos later...

100
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:31,930
...you'll wake up, you're 35, crying
about your life in front of the soaps.

101
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:35,137
I did you a favor. You get outside,
play around, make some friends.

102
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,177
Play kick the can, do some athletic stuff.

103
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,137
Go to school,
you're comfortable to play sports.

104
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,770
You have any ethnic in your background?
Any ethnicity in your background?

105
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:45,090
I bet you do, it's America.
You know what I mean?

106
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,978
Put it on the application for college.

107
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:50,530
All of a sudden, you get a little extra
money. Uncle Sam's none the wiser.

108
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,816
You take that extra money,
you buy a motorcycle.

109
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:56,336
Maybe you meet a guy at school.
Then you'll get pregnant with child.

110
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,934
It works out with the guy,
doesn't work out, who cares?

111
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:00,977
You're blessed to have a kid in your life.

112
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,132
You'll be athletic. You're gonna
be a moderate-to-lukewarm student.

113
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,860
And you're gonna have a child
before you graduate college.

114
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,693
Who are you gonna have to thank?
Not the guy in the red suit.

115
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,895
But your pal, Fred.

116
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,490
Sometimes it hurts to grow!
Hey, guy, you got a girl that kicks.

117
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:18,936
Is that from you or is that because
you use the TV as a babysitter?

118
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,570
Don't pay your bills again! Next time
I'll come and take your wife from you!

119
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,891
Plasma goes to my place. Pack it
separately, make sure it doesn't scratch.

120
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,338
<i>Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!</i>
<i>Everybody loves...</i>

121
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,096
Catch it, catch it, catch it one time.

122
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,810
Come on, come on, come on,
just a little bit.

123
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,575
That's it, just easy, easy. Damn it.

124
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,931
- Mind changing the station for me, pal?
- It's your buck, buddy.

125
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,572
Can you change that again, please?

126
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,256
Come on, I like that one.
That's a good one.

127
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,848
Can you pull over, please?

128
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,729
- Come on, we're still 15 blocks from the...
- Just pull the cab over, please.

129
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,095
Wanda, you have never been
more attractive to me.

130
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:35,732
Freddie, I'm mad at you.
No, I'm seriously mad at you.

131
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:38,051
Two whole days, you don't call me.

132
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:42,213
I try and have a conversation
with you about our moving in together...

133
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:45,929
...and then you just disappear.
- Sweetheart, I did not just disappear.

134
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:49,854
I found myself in a business opportunity
with a sheik. From India.

135
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,817
A sh... There aren't any sheiks in India!

136
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:54,653
Don't tell that to this guy.
I had to go on a yoga retreat.

137
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:58,614
But to be honest with you,
my chi... really strong right now.

138
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,896
Freddie, do you know what tomorrow is?

139
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,374
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

140
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,132
Yeah, I know what tomorrow is.

141
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,177
- What is it?
- Tomorrow is tomorrow.

142
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,049
And today is today, and we shouldn't
be wasting it arguing with each other.

143
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:15,816
No, Freddie, apart from that, all right.
What is the significance of tomorrow?

144
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:19,529
What you're referring to in this
conversation is the day after today?

145
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,094
- Yes.
- You're asking me...

146
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:23,615
What I'm trying to say is that
when it gets to midnight...

147
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:28,251
...and then it's one minute past midnight,
tomorrow begins, then it is my birthday!

148
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,253
- That?
- Oh, no.

149
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,174
I know that. The birthday thing,
that I know. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

150
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,649
Don't try and pretend
you knew it was my birthday...

151
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,572
...because I know you. You didn't know.

152
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,617
- I do know it's your birthday.
- You forgot.

153
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:43,897
I have a surprise planned for you
for your birthday but you ruined it.

154
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,052
That's what I need, surprises.
Remember our three-year anniversary?

155
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,371
You told me to brush up on French,
you drop hints about the Eiffel Tower...

156
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,213
...and then you took me gambling
on a riverboat in Indiana.

157
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:55,371
The French thing was
to get you off the scent.

158
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,498
The thing about it was that
I bought those French books on tape.

159
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,979
I studied for three weeks.

160
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,337
That French is yours, that's a part
of you, no one can take that away.

161
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,813
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

162
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,936
I just can't stay mad at you.

163
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,853
Freddie, will you tell me
about the surprise?

164
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,215
If I tell you, it would
no longer be a surprise.

165
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,699
I know, I know, but...

166
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,976
Yeah, you're right.
You shouldn't tell me, then.

167
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,495
You know what?

168
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,254
I'm gonna tell you about the surprise.
It's not a surprise.

169
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,888
You already know what it is,
so it's not a surprise.

170
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,177
So this time, on this specific occasion,
I'll let you know what it is.

171
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,655
- It's a dinner.
- Yeah.

172
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,813
At a pretty exciting new hot spot
here in town called...

173
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,291
...Bonsai Palace.

174
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:45,737
Oh, that sounds familiar, Bonsai Palace.

175
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,217
- Yeah.
- You're not making this up?

176
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,258
If we go to Bonsai Palace,
it's gonna exist? It's gonna be there?

177
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:56,618
Absolutely, it's a hot spot.
Think romance, and think getting lost.

178
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,089
<i>Charlie Brown...</i>

179
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,253
<i>... you're the only person I know who can</i>
<i>take a wonderful season like Christmas...</i>

180
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,899
<i>... and turn it into a problem.</i>

181
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,415
<i>Maybe Lucy's right.</i>
<i>Of all the Charlie Browns...</i>

182
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,569
My man, Fred.

183
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,412
Don't come in bouncing off the walls.

184
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,890
If you can come in here, relaxed and be
a gentleman, then you can come in.

185
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,971
- Can you do that? You want some milk?
- Yeah.

186
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,256
Okay. Don't be playing
with the channels...

187
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,809
...and putting on videos
and dancing, it's exhausting.

188
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,413
Okay.

189
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,650
Do you gotta go over the couch?
With the feet.

190
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,572
The feet are dirty, the couch is clean.

191
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:28,537
- You put the feet off the thing.
- My bad.

192
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,089
- Do you want the milk?
- Yeah, go get that milk.

193
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:35,612
Yo, Fred. I asked Santa for a puppy
this year. I'm gonna name him Macaroni.

194
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:39,295
I don't know how Santa's gonna know
where to bring me my gifts this year...

195
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,178
...because I don't know where I'll be.

196
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,934
Because you know how sometimes,
if my grandma's sick...

197
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,056
...I end up staying over at my aunt's.

198
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:49,098
Most of the time, we just end up
staying over at her boyfriend's.

199
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,296
What you think, Fred?
Think Santa'll find me?

200
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,815
- Slam, you ever thought about Santa?
- Not really.

201
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,370
The guy's in a big red suit flying around
because he craves the spotlight.

202
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,610
He's a fame junkie. The guy's a clown.

203
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,816
He's a megalomaniac.
It's all a big shell game.

204
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:04,289
He presents himself like,
"Look at me, I'm so nice."

205
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,735
He's getting paid.
He's got a whole thing happening.

206
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,460
Know they sell more Santa
statues along with trinkets...

207
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,979
...than they do of Buddha?

208
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:14,132
Oh, the big fat dude that be
in the nail salon? He be like:

209
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,531
Don't be a cheerleader for Santa Claus.
Think about it, watch the angles.

210
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,849
Don't drink the Kool-Aid.

211
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,090
- I like Kool-Aid.
- Don't drink this Kool-Aid.

212
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,938
You not gonna ask Santa for nothing?

213
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:27,139
Slam, I get what I want without charity
from Santa. Two hands on the milk.

214
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,416
- Two hands.
- Two hands if you're gonna drink.

215
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:32,538
I'm about to step into a
lucrative business situation right now.

216
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,213
I'm working. I'm creating assets.

217
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:36,052
You know? I'm starting a new business.

218
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,858
- A ass what?
- Assets.

219
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,250
- What that mean?
- Get your mind out of the gutter.

220
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,851
Please, Leon, it's gotta be the spot.

221
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:45,295
You gotta come up
with the full 50,000 by the 20th.

222
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,179
The only way I can hold it.
People are breathing down my neck.

223
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,935
I got the money. Maybe we're
not underst... I got the money.

224
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,694
It's not about the money.
It's liquidating the money.

225
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:58,899
I have to get the money in a
liquid situation so that I can pour it.

226
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,614
Listen, what's the largest
growth industry in America?

227
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,099
It's gambling, right?

228
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,093
This space we're standing in
right now, in three months' time...

229
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,296
...will be the most-trafficked
OTB in the city.

230
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:11,179
We're across the street from
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

231
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,856
So every day when the market closes
and the day traders hit the streets...

232
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,979
...this is where they're gonna come,
Leon. It means everything to me. Please.

233
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,449
Listen, I don't wanna hear
no futzing from you, pal.

234
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,451
I need it by the 22nd. The best I can do.

235
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,089
Whatever. It's gonna be fi...
We're gonna work it out.

236
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:28,774
- I wanna hear you say the 22nd.
- It's gonna be perfect.

237
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,613
- 22nd is perfect.
- Likely the 22nd, or the 23rd, either way.

238
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,613
22nd and that's it. That's the best
I can do. And that's it.

239
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,852
No more. Icky, but done.
But if it's the 23rd...

240
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,169
Done.

241
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,214
- Twenty-second.
- Two-two.

242
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,851
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

243
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,772
Thank you.

244
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,178
Merry Christmas!

245
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,728
All right, ladies and gentlemen!

246
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,892
Step up for everyone's
favorite charity, People Help the People!

247
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:00,733
Hey there, give me a hug!
You gorgeous leopard.

248
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,652
Who's the queen of the jungle? You are!

249
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,937
Let me see what we got. Oh, I like it.
Come on, I like how you do it!

250
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,250
Rock me with some paper! Dig deeper.

251
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,251
And another 20.
Let me see what you got.

252
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,332
I'll take both of them. Whatever.
Merry Christmas to you.

253
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,489
Hey, lady!

254
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,697
If you want salvation, no army can
give it to you, only people can!

255
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,658
Bring your action down here! That's it.
Give me that action.

256
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,778
- We only help the people out.
- What do you think you're doing?

257
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:27,376
Just give me a second. I'll deal with you
in a minute. Don't crowd my action.

258
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,531
Then help some of
these people out this year.

259
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,373
Merry Christmas. You're beautiful, great.
Get out of here.

260
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,373
I don't see your permit.
You need a permit to work this street.

261
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,213
Okay. I don't answer to you, buddy.
I answer to the people.

262
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:41,690
- Mind your own business, please.
- The Salvation Army is my business!

263
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,169
- What's going on?
- This guy's working without papers!

264
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:47,730
- And he's bashing the Salvation Army!
- I'm not bashing the Salvation Army.

265
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:51,495
I never bashed anything. That wasn't
bashing anybody. Don't make up lies.

266
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,979
Show me your papers, clown.

267
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,131
Papers? What are you from, the 1950s?

268
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:58,451
Look up People Help the People
on the Internet, you'll see a picture.

269
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,451
Why don't you step into
the 21 st century?

270
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,735
Right. Call the cops, man.

271
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,618
You got a cop right there!

272
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,293
- Where?
- Right over there.

273
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,774
Stop, thief!

274
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,452
Somebody call the cops!

275
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,050
- Cut him off!
- He's an impostor!

276
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,049
Take his legs out!

277
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,580
- Come on! Help us out! Help us out!
- Get him!

278
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,969
Get out of the way!

279
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,373
We got him!

280
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,451
- You guys got him!
- Come on! Come on!

281
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,368
Let's dance. Let's dance!

282
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,019
Come on, he can't take us all!

283
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,856
Only one man's gonna walk away
from this thing, and I promise you...

284
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,899
...it'll be the lightning quick dude with
the big yellow things in his hands. Dig it?

285
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,252
Nice hat, Santa!

286
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,853
Wanda, are you there?

287
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:33,011
Can you hear me? It's Fred calling.

288
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,217
Kind of important you pick up right now.
Are you at the restaurant?

289
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,973
Give a call when you get a chance,
as soon as possible. Okay?

290
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,779
Hopefully, I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

291
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:05,452
Yeah, she's not picking up
the phone, so...

292
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,775
What the hell, it's Christmas.
Go ahead, make another call.

293
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,899
Oh, boy.

294
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,651
No, there's not even a hint of gray left.
It's gone totally white.

295
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,050
Honey, you think I'd look silly
if I dyed it?

296
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,939
You have a nice full head of hair, honey.

297
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,534
It's white, though. Prematurely white.

298
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,817
Oh, Nick. You carry the weight
of the world on your shoulders.

299
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,538
I am not stressed out.

300
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,578
I just got a lot on my mind is all.

301
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,293
You seem upset.

302
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:43,930
Sweetie, we're 2 percent
behind our delivery quota of last year.

303
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,091
And last year, we barely made it.
Want cookie.

304
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,455
Sweetie, you cannot keep
eating your stress away.

305
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,293
I mean, it's a bit odd that they're
checking up on me now.

306
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,931
I mean, they've never sent an
efficiency expert before. Why now?

307
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,209
<i>- Nick?</i>
- Fred!

308
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,019
- Oh, Nick.
- How's things there, Fred?

309
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,058
God, it's good hearing your voice.
How've things been with you?

310
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:10,212
Oh, well, fine, fine.
You know, business is crazy...

311
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:13,053
...but we're swell, we're swell.
How are you, huh?

312
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,415
That's great.
I'm really happy for you, Nick.

313
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,855
The Christmas thing is taking off.
That's awesome.

314
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,339
Yeah, it's catching on. Yeah.

315
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,378
So, what's up, Fred?
Is there anything I can do for you?

316
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:27,056
If you really wanted to send me a gift,
I guess it would be okay if you sent...

317
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,530
<i>... $5000 to the police station</i>
<i>in Michigan Avenue in my name.</i>

318
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,372
Five thousand dollars?

319
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,815
<i>I'm fine, by the way. I don 't... I'm fine.</i>

320
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,619
- I'm okay, but so you know, l...
<i>- Hold on a second, Fred.</i>

321
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,498
I don't know what this is about...

322
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,970
...but I know it can't be good.
- It sounds like he's in a tough spot.

323
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,892
<i>If you wanna do something for him...</i>

324
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:49,178
...I know it's hard, but you need
to practice tough love, honey.

325
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,171
- I'm a saint, sweetheart.
- Tough love.

326
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,137
Tough love's a little difficult for me.

327
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,653
Try for me, baby.

328
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,539
<i>- Hey, Fred?</i>
- Hey.

329
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,249
<i>So, 5 grand,</i>
<i>Michigan Avenue Police Station...</i>

330
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,689
...done.

331
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:07,336
- Merry Christmas, Fred.
<i>- Nick, that is... I really appreciate it, man.</i>

332
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,652
You know what?
I'm gonna give you a gift this year.

333
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,493
Yeah, I am, Nick. I'm gonna give you
$ 10,000 for Christmas.

334
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,696
Merry Christmas. Okay, how's that feel?

335
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:23,095
That's... I don't understand, though.
I'm giving you 5, Fred, so...

336
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,251
You gotta be open
to someone trying to give...

337
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,615
...because it feels good
for other people to give.

338
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,294
Go ahead, just send me $50,000
on top of the 5, okay?

339
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,133
<i>Then hold your breath, let me go</i>
<i>and blow that up into 60.</i>

340
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:37,179
Then I'm gonna give you $ 10,000 off
the top with the original $50,000 back...

341
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,695
...so that way I gave you
$ 10,000, you gave me $5000.

342
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,930
I gave you $5000. Merry Christmas.

343
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:45,775
Wait, wait, wait a second, Fred.

344
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:48,818
- Fifty thousand dollars on top of the 5?
- What? What?

345
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,733
<i>That's just icing on the cake.</i>
<i>I have a deal going on.</i>

346
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,255
Nick, do me a favor,
don't make this complicated.

347
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,969
<i>I'm in the spirit. Let one brother give</i>
<i>another brother a gift for Christmas.</i>

348
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,937
I feel great about it. Let me feel good?

349
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,736
<i>- Please.</i>
- All right. All right, all right.

350
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,255
Fred, fine. Look, I'll tell you what...

351
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,651
<i>... I will pay the 5000 for your bail, okay?</i>

352
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,336
But if you want the rest of this, then
you're just gonna have to come up here.

353
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,652
- No!
<i>- Yes! You earn that money!</i>

354
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:19,812
I don't think that's a good idea,
me and you to be with each other.

355
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:22,892
You know something?
You've never come up here to visit.

356
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,209
Not even once.

357
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:34,413
What is it exactly...?
What would I need to be doing up there?

358
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,739
Shave a few reindeer,
sprinkle the doodads on the cookies...

359
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:41,051
...put the stars up where the little guys
can't reach them. It's easy.

360
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,976
I'd have to have a hard out by the 22nd.
That's when I have my deal happening.

361
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,529
Okay. Twenty-second.

362
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,498
This isn't about me coming up,
then you having Mom ambush me...

363
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,618
Come on. I'm not gonna go
running to Mom.

364
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,890
I have no idea why you won't send 50
so I can blow it into 60 and give you 10.

365
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,339
I'm sorry. I'm gonna practice tough love
on you, buddy. All right?

366
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,899
And I'm telling you right now...

367
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,212
...if you do not agree, then I am sorry,
but I cannot pay your bail.

368
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,934
Wanda, can you buzz me in? It's Fred.

369
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,692
Hey, sweetheart, I know you're home!

370
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,655
Freddie, go home.
I don't wanna talk to you. Go home!

371
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,176
Okay, Wanda, I just wanted to get
a chance to come by and explain.

372
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:27,174
Oh, explain? You wanna explain to
me my romantic surprise birthday dinner?

373
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:30,059
I was working for the
People Help People charity organization.

374
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,290
I was chased by 30 Santa Clauses!

375
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,735
Shut up down there!
People are trying to sleep!

376
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,131
- I'm telling you the truth.
- She doesn't believe you, pal! So get lost!

377
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:42,179
Hey, Jerry Garcia, I'm having a talk
with someone who l... You're the worst.

378
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:44,934
Fred, will you go home right this minute!

379
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,729
Wanda, there's this unfortunate business
situation I have to leave for tonight.

380
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,969
You what?

381
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:53,257
Look, this is a business situation
that I'm in with my brother.

382
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,298
When we first met, I said,
"Have you got a brother or a sister?"

383
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,098
And you said, "No, Wanda, I don't!"

384
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,615
I have a bro...
I have the same mother and father...

385
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:04,136
...but I never felt like I had a brother.
The courts would tell me I would.

386
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,860
- No, listen to me...
- I am through with this relationship!

387
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,375
- I'm not through with this.
- I can't take it anymore.

388
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,973
- I can't take it!
- I can take it.

389
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:13,335
Freddie, I think I'm gonna
go back to London.

390
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,934
So good luck with your brother,
if he even exists!

391
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,536
- Good luck. I can't take it.
- It'll rain in London, you won't be happy...

392
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:21,459
Wanda!

393
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,979
Fred, I need you!

394
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,449
- Not now, I'm in a hurry.
- Pretend to be my father.

395
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,215
- What are you talking about?
- He's in here.

396
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,933
- Who are you?
- I'm the boy's father. Who are you?

397
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,094
We're with Child Services, sir. We're here
to remove this minor from an unfit home.

398
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,378
According to our records,
his father passed away a year ago.

399
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,411
I thought you said that your dad was...

400
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,892
All right, come here a second.

401
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,490
You can't count on anyone, Slam.

402
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,494
You gotta always look out for yourself.

403
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,138
And you know how to do that, right?

404
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,689
Yeah.

405
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,614
Let's get something straight.

406
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,170
If you're waiting for me to sing " The Sun
Will Come Out Tomorrow" on the way...

407
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,615
...you're wasting your time. Let's go.

408
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,532
Are you Fred?

409
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,849
Yeah.

410
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:02,778
Can I see some identification, please?

411
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,017
Well, nice to meet you, Fred. My name
is Willie. I'm Santa's head elf.

412
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,535
I wouldn't have known that.

413
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,260
So just the one bag?
Just the one carryon? I'll get it.

414
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,058
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

415
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:30,772
- Okay, I'll help you get...
- No, no. I got it. I got it. Okay.

416
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:36,456
- I'll just grab this here. That's okay.
- I could've gotten it.

417
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,453
If I had one more little shot at it,
I would've been just fine.

418
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:54,134
Come on.

419
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,090
So listen, I'm not so big
on all this flying...

420
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,534
Whoa, okay.

421
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,936
We'll start our descent to the North Pole.

422
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,898
We know you don't have an option
traveling to the North Pole...

423
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:39,336
...but we appreciate your business,
and I really enjoyed the conversation.

424
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,013
Okay, is this gonna be a steep...?

425
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,615
Really? The hockey stop?

426
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,658
Yeah, there's a passenger back here,
in case you didn't remember.

427
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,936
Oh, sorry. Least you didn't throw up.

428
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,058
Watch your step there. Well, here it is.

429
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,936
Main Street, North Pole.

430
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,136
Pretty, isn't it?

431
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,449
Workshop's behind you.

432
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:00,618
Mr. Claus? Hi. Hello. Welcome to the
North Pole. It's so nice to have you here.

433
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,179
I'm Santa's Little Helper.

434
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:05,218
I am sorry to rush you, but we
have to keep Santa on schedule...

435
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:09,373
...because we are 439 hours, 22
minutes, and 3 seconds until C-Day.

436
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,128
Charlene's as good with numbers
as she is beautiful.

437
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,694
Oh, thank you. Thank you...

438
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,492
- Willie.
- Willie!

439
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,932
Thank you, Willie.

440
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,132
So I'm expecting Santa in 26 seconds.

441
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,256
Big Red is entering Zone One.
I repeat, Big Red is entering Zone One.

442
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,417
- Allergies.
- He's got a gun!

443
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,813
Oh, no, no.

444
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,576
What's happening? Stop it!

445
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,734
- What's happening? Stop it!
- No, no, no, boys! Boys! Boys, easy!

446
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:58,978
Oh, Fred.

447
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,649
That was nuts!

448
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,857
What is happening here? You don't have
ninjas jump me when I first...

449
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,454
- What kind of greeting is that?
- Excuse the guys...

450
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,576
...it's the month before Christmas,
a tense time.

451
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,096
They get jumpy. They gotta
make sure nothing happens to me.

452
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,899
Maybe something should happen to them.
Maybe I give them something.

453
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:18,415
It won't happen again.
They won't do it again.

454
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:22,175
- You gotta put these guys on a leash.
- I got you. I'm on top of it, ASAP.

455
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,850
You remember Annette.
Say hey to Annette. Annette.

456
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:28,012
Annette, you didn't have to go get
all gussied up on my account.

457
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,258
That last stint in jail has sharpened
that rapier wit of yours.

458
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,412
That's great. I'm here for you and
I really can't do enough for you.

459
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:38,289
Really? I thought you were here to take
advantage of your well-meaning brother.

460
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,178
Oh, ho, okay.

461
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:43,455
Family's together again. Fun, fun, fun.

462
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,578
Hey, Fred, I've already made
your sleeping arrangements for you.

463
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,459
I have put you with Willie.

464
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,053
Well, here we are.

465
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,814
Oh, watch your head there. Come on in.

466
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,580
Here it is. What do you think?

467
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:00,450
Smurfy. Very Smurfy.

468
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,134
To be honest,
I don't get many houseguests.

469
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,331
No one's slept in that bunk
for 100 years.

470
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,696
Good night, Willie.
Thank you for having me.

471
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,134
Good night, Fred.

472
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,137
You sure you wouldn't be more
comfortable down here on the bottom?

473
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,053
I don't think it's gonna make much
of a difference, Willie.

474
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,814
- Okay. Night, Fred.
- Good night.

475
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:33,419
Willie, just for the record,
I'm not really a morning person.

476
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:37,933
Well, Santa did ask me to give you a full
orientation of the gift-giving process...

477
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,933
...so we'd better get a move on here.

478
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,698
Here it is, Fred, Santa's Workshop.

479
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:08,657
It all starts with a kid and a letter.

480
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:11,648
<i>All over the world,</i>
<i>children are writing to Santa...</i>

481
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,776
<i>... asking for what they want</i>
<i>for Christmas.</i>

482
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,132
<i>Dear Santa...</i>

483
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:19,258
<i>... all I want for Christmas</i>
<i>is an orange bicycle...</i>

484
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,058
<i>... with banana handlebars.</i>

485
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,178
<i>All the kids ' letters come here</i>
<i>to the North Pole Post Office...</i>

486
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,331
<i>... the busiest in the whole world.</i>

487
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:32,572
<i>Once they're sorted, the letters</i>
<i>come straight to the Toy Factory.</i>

488
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,060
- Orange bicycle for Molly Gordon.
- Put her through.

489
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,179
<i>Each and every toy that a child</i>
<i>asks for is handmade by the elves.</i>

490
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:46,015
<i>It's important to Santa that every child</i>
<i>feels taken care of.</i>

491
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,774
<i>Once built, the toys</i>
<i>make their way to Packaging.</i>

492
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:53,890
And finally, the toys are stored until
Christmas Eve, when Santa delivers them.

493
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,698
It's good to know. Thank you, Willie.

494
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,819
<i>Here comes "Here Comes Santa Claus"</i>
<i>on NP- 100.</i>

495
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,658
Oh, you're gonna love this.
We have our very own DJ.

496
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,012
Hey, Donnie! DJ Donnie.

497
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,538
Well, well, well, it's the saint
who puts the chill in the North Pole.

498
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:15,850
Hey, hey, DJ Donnie!
Say hey to my big brother, Freddie.

499
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,932
Yo, brother Fred, can I get a "Ho, ho"?

500
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,931
No.

501
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,897
You Scrooge, you lose.

502
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,090
Our Naughty-Nice Department.

503
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:28,854
This is the key to the whole process...

504
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,092
...the nerve center
of the entire operation, Fred.

505
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,172
You have a Ten Most-Naughty list?

506
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,819
Oh, yeah. Yeah, right now...

507
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:40,610
...we got Johnny Rollins in Nova Scotia.
He's occupying the number one spot.

508
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:44,136
Last month he bit his father
and his dentist.

509
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,733
But why did he bite them?

510
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:49,933
Well, I assume that they got
their hands too close to his mouth.

511
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:53,410
Of course, sometimes kids
are both naughty and nice.

512
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:57,368
So in that case, we do an
up-to-date determination, hence...

513
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,328
...the snowglobe.

514
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,650
Let me show you how it works, all right?

515
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,412
Timmy Jackson...

516
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,095
...New York City.

517
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:06,889
Watch this.

518
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,896
What are you doing? Get out of my room!
Get out of my room!

519
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,815
Oh, boy. Okay, that seems
pretty cut and dried.

520
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,977
What, we don't
know what happens, what...?

521
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:26,212
Good morning, Fred. Honey,
may I have a word with you, please?

522
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,338
You betcha. Fred, you just stay
right there. Don't you move an inch.

523
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:32,140
I better check up on the all-girls
Swedish swimming team.

524
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,813
I'm hoping they're naughty!

525
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,937
- Fred is really motivated.
- You think?

526
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:39,297
- He's gonna be a big help here.
- How you doing? Be working with you.

527
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,576
The efficiency expert
arrives in 15 minutes.

528
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,731
- We're gonna be fine.
- I know it, I know it.

529
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,731
- Give me a little something.
- Yes, I will.

530
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:48,332
There we go. Alrighty.

531
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,939
Let's get you to work.

532
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,129
Now, I'm going to explain this to you
in very simple terms, okay?

533
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,009
Now, see those blue files?
I want you to review those files, okay?

534
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,098
If the kid strikes you as naughty...

535
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,290
...bam! Stamp him "Naughty."

536
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:07,577
All right? But if the kid
strikes you as nice...

537
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,496
Yep, you stamp them "Nice."

538
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,252
I'm a cog in the wheel. I am.

539
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:16,015
Good, all right. I gotta hustle, because
I gotta meet somebody right now, okay?

540
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,852
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Captain's on deck.

541
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,897
- Rest assured, my man.
- Mail delivery!

542
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,052
- The ship's getting steered safely!
- All right, buddy.

543
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,097
- Great. So this is it?
- Yeah, right.

544
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,693
That's just Bethesda, Maryland.

545
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:31,733
<i>All right, everyone. Oh, my goodness,</i>
<i>it's "Here Comes Santa Claus!"</i>

546
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:45,374
You didn't have to travel
by helicopter, Mr. Northcutt.

547
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,178
I would've happily sent the sleigh.

548
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:49,058
I despise reindeer.

549
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:53,977
Would you like to settle in?
We have your room ready.

550
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,972
You could take a little nap.

551
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:57,892
I don't nap.

552
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:00,131
Well, that sounds like
it's gonna be dandy.

553
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:03,690
As you can see from the chart
labeled 116-9C...

554
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:08,331
...the average size of a child's wish list
has grown a lot in the last 200 years.

555
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:11,810
In the 1800s, for example, children
rarely asked for more than one item...

556
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,052
...and usually these items
were of a intangible nature.

557
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,735
Something like a family member's health
or the end of war or famine.

558
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:21,653
I remember that.
Try fitting that down the chimney, huh?

559
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:25,893
Chart 345-11 B shows that today...

560
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:29,735
...the average child
asks for 15 gifts per letter.

561
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,733
Growing child demands and increasingly
complicated toy making...

562
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:36,973
...are putting your operation further
behind each year. It's not good enough.

563
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:41,372
Well, now, we are not here to give
every child every toy that they want.

564
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:45,419
Mr. Northcutt, part of Christmas is being
grateful for the things that we can have.

565
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,652
- Yes, well, if it were only that simple.
- It's not?

566
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:51,539
No. Sadly. You see...

567
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,097
...the board is seriously considering...

568
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:56,769
...shutting you down.

569
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,135
What?

570
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,972
- That's so unfair.
- Shutting us down?

571
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,619
Streamlining, consolidating...

572
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:05,578
...outsourcing an entirely new
operation based at...

573
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:08,208
...and I know this is gonna be
tough for you to hear...

574
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:10,336
...based at the South Pole.

575
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:15,853
It's not just you. We're putting the tooth
fairy on a one child, one tooth system.

576
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,978
You lose your first tooth,
get a buck, put it under the pillow.

577
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:21,495
But then get on with your life.
It's getting a bit...

578
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:24,174
Don't you think? Also,
we're gonna dump the Easter bunny.

579
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,212
It just doesn't make any sense anymore.

580
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,814
I mean, Easter and bunnies
and eggs and all that.

581
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,732
Where's the synergy? Don't get it.

582
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,100
Now, let's move on to the next item
on the list, shall we?

583
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,934
How much are you actually
feeding those elves?

584
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:43,931
Wanda Blinkowski, Chicago, Illinois.

585
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,328
Is that someone special?

586
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,775
Yeah. That's my girl, there.

587
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,330
Oh, no. I totally spaced out.
Look, I got a quarter right here.

588
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,259
<i>Well, I'm sorry, darling,</i>
<i>but you're two minutes too late.</i>

589
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,809
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

590
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,580
That must make you feel bad,
having people argue with you.

591
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,698
Yeah, well, it's definitely
not the favorite part of my job.

592
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:10,533
How about I make it up to you?
Let me take you to dinner.

593
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,169
Go to dinner with you?

594
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,412
Consider it a meal
and sparkling conversation.

595
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,449
No, I can't. Thank you, but I can't.

596
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,817
It's always painful to watch
a guy crash and burn, my man.

597
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,174
You have a boyfriend?

598
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,572
No. No, actually, I don't.

599
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,935
<i>Well, that's a good thing.</i>
<i>What do you say?</i>

600
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,570
Well, I'll give you a ticket.

601
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,096
And I'll give you my card.

602
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,898
Okay. Nice to meet you.

603
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:41,415
<i>This may be the best ticket I ever got.</i>

604
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,616
<i>You gotta pay it within 30 days,</i>
<i>you know that?</i>

605
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,736
<i>I'll see you before then, right?</i>

606
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,173
El Paso.

607
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,729
Great.

608
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,018
<i>You're not gonna believe this! Another</i>
<i>request for "Here Comes Santa Claus!"</i>

609
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,296
<i>This time from Beth in Accounting.</i>
<i>Here you go!</i>

610
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:14,136
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding
me with the "Santa Claus" again?

611
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,978
Hey, DJ!

612
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,014
- DJ Donnie!
- What up, Fred!

613
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:23,014
Stop playing the same song over and over
again. It becomes like mental torture.

614
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,011
But, Fred, it's so catchy!

615
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:31,179
God. Okay, Donnie. It's one song that's
being played over and over again.

616
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:34,696
And the only thing that breaks that up
is you announcing it's the same song.

617
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:37,420
It would be a nice gesture
to play something different.

618
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,411
- I said no!
- Donnie, change the song.

619
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,338
- No! No!
- Change the song!

620
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,968
You know what? I'm gonna change
the song, then, for you.

621
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,529
What are you getting physical for?
Music's about love.

622
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,009
Don't get physical with me.
We're trying to share.

623
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:52,729
What are you doing? Stop it. Come on,
stop... What, are you gonna do it to me?

624
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,095
Donnie, stop.
You're acting like an untrained dog.

625
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,889
Get ahold of yourself. Take a breath.
Stop swinging at me. Will you calm down?

626
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,290
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna Supernanny you.

627
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:04,099
Put you in the Naughty cabinet.
You can't handle yourself.

628
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,410
Listen to me, calm it down a little.
Stop it.

629
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:09,174
Use your words. Use your words.

630
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:13,291
I'll let you out once you're sorry
and you're ready to turn a corner...

631
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:17,248
...and be a team player, okay?
- Don't do it! Put my elf foot up your butt!

632
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,980
I'm from the
south side of the North Pole, man.

633
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,212
- I hear you. Let me out!
- Let's heat it up! Let's heat it up!

634
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,256
Come on, let's loosen it up in here!

635
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:32,129
You got the same thing playing all the
time. Let's liven it up! Let's get dancing.

636
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,656
Let's get our blood pumping. Let's make
some bad decisions with each other.

637
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,329
Come on.

638
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,697
Stop looking shy, baby, light it up.

639
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,293
Oh, my goodness.

640
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,011
It sounds angry!

641
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,295
I know.

642
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:52,096
I like it.

643
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:53,579
Bring it in!

644
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:00,132
You wanna come up here?

645
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,576
Your continued existence
at the North Pole...

646
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,857
...will all be decided on a simple
three-strike policy.

647
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:51,729
Make it through Christmas without three
strikes, I send back a positive report.

648
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,209
lf, however, you do get three strikes...

649
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,418
...this entire operation
will be shut down permanently.

650
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:02,530
Oh, and one more thing, absolutely
nobody is to know why I'm here.

651
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,452
Especially the elves.

652
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:10,416
Of course. Mr. Northcutt, the elves are
extremely dedicated and hardworking.

653
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,810
I am confident that they
will impress you, sir.

654
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:16,536
Ho, ho, holy cow.

655
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,572
Stop it. Stop it. Stop.

656
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:52,176
Everyone, this is Mr. Northcutt.

657
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,371
He'll be with us through Christmas.

658
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,929
Please make him welcome
and let him observe.

659
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,735
Back to work.

660
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:03,017
They have never behaved
like that before. I assure you.

661
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,932
No elf discipline.

662
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:08,297
Showing a complete lack of control
over your entire workforce.

663
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:11,930
That's a biggie. It's disappointing.
And that would be strike one.

664
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,213
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
- Oh, that's Fred. That's my older brother.

665
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:20,929
- He's just helping out for the season.
- I didn't know you had a brother.

666
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,332
Mr. Northcutt, I should have someone
show you around. Willie!

667
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,212
Take a tour, there, Mr. Northcutt.

668
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:33,178
Fred. What in the heck are you doing?

669
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:37,339
Nick, let me be completely honest
with you here, the DJ is a real problem.

670
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,412
Fred, he's an elf that plays records.

671
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:44,017
Nick, he continued to play the same
song over and over and over and over...

672
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:45,414
Got you. Got you.

673
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:49,289
He then decided to lay his hands on me
and get physical and tried to hurt me.

674
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,939
Okay? Now, I have a decision
to make in that moment.

675
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:56,137
Do I wanna try to get physical?
Do I wanna pound this elf's head in?

676
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:00,259
The answer to that is no. I want him to
know how it feels not to be respected...

677
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,856
...when you're trying to do your work.
- Just lower your voice. Keep it down.

678
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:07,410
And to be honest, if you decide to punish
him, I'm not gonna be mad at you.

679
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,138
I'm not gonna be upset with you.

680
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:13,134
If you wanna bring the hammer down
upon his little DJ hands, do it, dude.

681
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:17,418
Okay. All right. That's a thought.
And I'm gonna sit on that and let it boil.

682
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:21,892
But what I'm trying to tell you is, the
elves have got to stay sharp, right now.

683
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,051
Very important, okay?

684
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:27,769
We can't have any type of problems,
anymore, okay?

685
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,410
I get it. We're two brothers talking now,
I know where you're coming from.

686
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,491
That's all that counts.
That's what counts.

687
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,896
Now that you said that,
it's not gonna happen...

688
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,496
...I'm gonna kill him with kindness.
- No, no, no, you don't have to.

689
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:43,613
Love, kindness, it's coming off of you
like radiation or something.

690
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,055
No, no, no.
You're gonna stay at your station.

691
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,289
Right.

692
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:49,371
- Smooth sailing, right?
- The smoothest sailing.

693
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,459
Freddie, I am so glad you took
my invitation for dinner.

694
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,054
I'm excited we're gonna be able
to hang out as brothers.

695
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,778
- Break bread, right?
- Absolutely.

696
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,169
I want one.

697
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,217
- Nick! Nick!
- Oh, boy. What?

698
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,893
- Nick!
- What?

699
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,334
- Nick, come here.
- Okay, okay.

700
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,411
What the heck is Mom doing
in the house?

701
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,935
I want you to be honest,
does she know I'm here?

702
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,854
Call me crazy, but my mom comes
and visits me for the holidays every year.

703
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:23,293
I'm not going in there, Nick,
because I don't visit with Mom...

704
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:26,850
...and I don't for good reason.
- It would be really nice, if, for once...

705
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:31,536
...things were nice and calm
and you just dropped by for dinner.

706
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:35,409
- This isn't even debatable. I'm not going.
- Ho, ho, ho, I'm not gonna listen to no.

707
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,777
There's a book, <i>Does Fred Go to Dinner?</i>
Flip through the pages...

708
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:41,613
...and last page, Fred does not go
to dinner. The End.

709
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,534
The sequel, know what it's called?
<i>Ding-dong, Who 's There? Why, it's Fred.</i>

710
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,338
- I'm not going.
- Pumpkin pie. Come on.

711
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,698
Get it through your head.
I am not going to dinner!

712
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,651
Hello, I hope I'm not intruding...

713
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:02,778
...but I ran into your parents,
and they invited me to dinner.

714
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,134
Oh, no, no, yeah, welcome, welcome.

715
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,579
- Here we are.
- So, Frederick, how have you been?

716
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:16,857
- I've been good, Ma. I've been real good.
- That's nice.

717
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,409
I'll tell you, Fred has been doing
a bang-up job...

718
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,935
...down in the Naughty-Nice Department.

719
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:23,579
I wouldn't say
I've been doing a bang-up job.

720
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:26,857
I had complications
and hit rough spots...

721
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:29,978
...but I'm doing the best I can.
- Oh, yeah, no, no, no...

722
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:34,213
...you are proving to be
one very hard worker.

723
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:38,339
Well, I would imagine he's probably
a very hard worker, considering.

724
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,419
Considering what?

725
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:44,936
Considering that you didn't have the
time to come to our anniversary party.

726
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:48,331
- Your brother gave us quite a shindig.
- Fred sent a lovely gift, though.

727
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:51,970
Come on, now, that massage chair,
that looked very, very expensive.

728
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:53,493
Yes, I'm sure it was.

729
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,458
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?

730
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:00,339
- I don't see... What's happening?
- Nothing's happening.

731
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,853
Okay.

732
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:06,258
- Oh, you all right?
- Even enjoyed the card that came with it.

733
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:09,533
Do you remember what you wrote
on the card, Frederick?

734
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,770
Let's see, was it something like:

735
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,693
"Happy anniversary, I hope you
choke on your meal"?

736
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:20,138
Now you're just being silly.

737
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,860
Have some gravy, darling.
The potatoes are awfully dry.

738
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:26,376
Phyllis, I wish you wouldn't do that,
because Nicholas needs to lose weight.

739
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,859
He's perfect!

740
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:31,171
You're looking at a man who can
fly around the world in a single night.

741
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,018
- That's unbelievable!
- Okay, Mom.

742
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:37,935
You know, I can never get over that,
Nicholas. I just... You amaze me.

743
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,489
- Isn't it amazing?
- I think it's absolutely amazing.

744
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:43,618
To think that he can fly around
to a million houses in one night...

745
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,214
...breaking and entering,
staring at little children...

746
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,291
...eat the little kids' cookies and stuff.

747
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:51,497
That's a phenomenal occurrence.
And I get jacked out of my mind...

748
00:46:51,660 --> 00:46:55,016
...just thinking about all those laws
being broken. Don't you guys feel it?

749
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,978
Frederick, why are you so upset?

750
00:46:58,260 --> 00:47:00,376
Oh, come on, Mom. Don't...

751
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,820
I just wish you were a little more
like your brother.

752
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,016
Great. Okay.

753
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,252
I have a feeling I'd be much more
comfortable back in my little hut...

754
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:11,536
...with some Hot Pockets
and a milkshake.

755
00:47:11,740 --> 00:47:13,810
Come on. Don't be like that. Fred.

756
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:21,848
I just love meeting people's families.
I find it so...

757
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:24,294
...revealing.

758
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,973
Night, Frosty! See you tomorrow!

759
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:38,055
- Fred! Terrific! Come on in, my friend.
- How are you, Willie?

760
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:40,012
I'm great! Pull up a stool.

761
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,859
Hey, eggnog for Fred, Frosty.

762
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,976
- Sure, they're on the way.
- Make it a double.

763
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,255
Thank you.

764
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,489
Hey, Fred.

765
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,213
- Charlene.
- Yeah.

766
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,292
You know, you see these
people after work...

767
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,055
...and I don't even recognize them. You
know, like, "Oh, of course. Charlene."

768
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:10,450
- Yeah.
- Good night, Fred.

769
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:14,620
- Good night, Charlene.
- Good night...

770
00:48:17,020 --> 00:48:18,772
- Willie.
- Willie.

771
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:26,576
Fred, I don't... I don't...

772
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:29,132
I don't understand, Fred.

773
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:31,371
She doesn't remember my name?

774
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:34,698
What is it, Fred? Is it...? It's me, isn't it?

775
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,738
You can tell me, Fred, it's okay.
Because you're my friend.

776
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:40,130
It's just that... She thinks I'm a freak.

777
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,335
I love her. I love her.

778
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,012
Willie, now look. You love to laugh.
You're a lot of fun to be around.

779
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,569
Fred, I can't even tell a joke.

780
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:53,857
I say the last line first. I'm afraid
everyone's gonna stop listening.

781
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,453
This thing is very easy.

782
00:48:55,620 --> 00:48:59,533
Let her know that you're ready for fun,
and you are not gonna apologize for it.

783
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,209
You know, at last year's
after-Christmas party...

784
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:07,132
...I almost asked her to dance.

785
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:09,370
Then I remembered I can't dance.

786
00:49:10,460 --> 00:49:12,928
- Yet.
- What?

787
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:14,933
Can't dance yet.

788
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:24,100
Fred. I feel ridiculous.

789
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:27,013
I don't know how to dance.
I don't know the steps.

790
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:30,377
This is very uncomfortable for me.

791
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:33,293
Come on. Get out of your head
for a second. Get into your body!

792
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,618
Okay, see, I'm not gonna do that.
I can't actually do that.

793
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:39,340
We're no longer talking with this,
we're gonna talk with...

794
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,774
Bring it. Bring it right now.

795
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:44,296
Bring all that green goodness that you
have on and bring it right up on me.

796
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,691
Come on, this beautiful green angel.
Now, put one hand here.

797
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:50,613
Great. Put another hand here.
Come on, grip it. Don't be shy.

798
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,930
All we're gonna do
is a little bit of a baby sway.

799
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,660
That's it, just a gentle rock
back and forth. Just easy.

800
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,697
Now, you got short arms,
which is good...

801
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,657
...because it means you gotta get close.

802
00:49:59,820 --> 00:50:02,698
So go ahead, pull this big tugboat
to shore. Anchors aweigh.

803
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:08,810
That's it. Okay, now, the next thing
you do is put your hand on my back.

804
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:12,335
That's not my back,
but it is a little bit naughty.

805
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:16,209
I like where you're headed, but for these
purposes, let's just keep it professional.

806
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,972
- Fred.
- Now, remember, Willie...

807
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,859
...dancing is not about dancing, right?

808
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:23,818
It's about connecting.
Now, look me in the eye.

809
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,136
Great. Now, if I was a girl, I'd get goose
bumps with what you just brought.

810
00:50:28,620 --> 00:50:32,249
The other great thing about dancing
is it's the perfect bridge to a kiss.

811
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:35,333
So all you gotta do is have fun,
let me know I can have fun...

812
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,572
...and then when the time's right,
that's when you make your move.

813
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:41,652
Get my blood pumping. Start to feel it.

814
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:43,453
Get your blood pumping!

815
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:46,134
Let's get excited. Let's make it happen.

816
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:49,656
Come on, big guy. Turn around
and show me what you don't know.

817
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,893
That's it. Okay. That's one way
to look at it. Keep moving it, baby.

818
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,211
That's it. Keep rolling. There's no rules.
I like it. You're making it happen.

819
00:50:57,380 --> 00:51:01,214
You're dancing. That's okay,
and it's not okay, and it's okay!

820
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,259
Feel it! Stay with it.

821
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:19,698
Wind it up. I like it! Heat it up.
Work it harder! Stay with it, brother!

822
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:38,852
Oh, I forgot my gloves.

823
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:42,210
It's okay. Just get up calmly.

824
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,133
That's all right...

825
00:51:52,420 --> 00:51:53,739
Willie!

826
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:08,979
So you fell down, big deal.

827
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,974
Fred, not everybody falls down
on his face in front of the girl he loves.

828
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,416
I looked like a total idiot out there.

829
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,652
How am I ever gonna be seen
in public again? It's ridiculous.

830
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,415
Thank goodness Blitzen didn't feel that
way the first time he learned how to fly.

831
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,578
When Blitzen learned to f...?
Why don't I know this story?

832
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:29,334
Oh, come off it, Willie.
Everyone knows this story.

833
00:52:29,540 --> 00:52:32,612
- When Blitzen learned to fly?
- He fell on his face.

834
00:52:33,060 --> 00:52:34,652
- He did?
- He'd try and take a run... Yeah.

835
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,697
He'd run and he'd fall flat on his face.

836
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:39,170
But he picked himself up
and he'd keep trying.

837
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,730
And eventually,
he stopped thinking and he flew.

838
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:46,217
- It's common knowledge.
- Fred, come on.

839
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:48,769
- It's true.
- I'm not Blitzen, though. I'm no Blitzen.

840
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:50,498
Well, I disagree with you, Willie.

841
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,574
I know you got more
Blitzen in you than you realize.

842
00:52:56,820 --> 00:52:58,412
Love is so complicated.

843
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:00,853
Yeah, can be.

844
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:03,255
It hurts.

845
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:06,214
I'm proud of you, Willie.

846
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:10,054
Now, good night.

847
00:53:11,060 --> 00:53:12,459
Good night, Fred.

848
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:41,215
Oh, Fred. Oh, where, oh, where
did all the kids' letters go?

849
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:48,933
Oh, isn't that sweet?
Lucy wants a cooking set.

850
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,456
Well, here's how you make pasta, darling.
There's a start.

851
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:58,579
Oh, little Keenan Adams
wants a bike for Christmas.

852
00:53:58,740 --> 00:54:01,891
Well, Keenan, I guess you'll be taking
the bus to school from now on.

853
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:08,131
<i>Oh, Freddie, Freddie, you have been</i>
<i>so very, very naughty.</i>

854
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,216
I didn't take any of the files
out of the room. I never got to the S's.

855
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,417
Fred, I don't need to tell you how
very important these files are.

856
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,015
Without them, we have no idea
what the children want.

857
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,250
Or whether they've been marked
Naughty or Nice.

858
00:54:25,420 --> 00:54:28,696
And it was your responsibility,
of course, to keep track of them.

859
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:32,449
I just told you, I would know if l...
I didn't take any... What is going on here?

860
00:54:32,860 --> 00:54:35,772
And why are you standing there
judging me with your arms folded?

861
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,578
I'm not judging you, I'm nervous.

862
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,130
I'd be nervous too if I was up to no
good. Doth who protests the most.

863
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:43,131
- Can you believe this guy?
- Okay. Come on.

864
00:54:43,300 --> 00:54:45,609
- I got my eye on you, Bob.
- Yeah? Anytime, big fella.

865
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:46,769
Bob, settle down.

866
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,454
You wanna talk like an elf,
you have to act like an elf.

867
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,019
- I'm easy to find.
- Big talk.

868
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:53,410
He's got a bigger reach than you, Bob.

869
00:54:58,060 --> 00:55:00,130
- Trouble?
- No, no, no.

870
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:03,895
No? Nobody in Wisconsin's
gonna get any gifts this year!

871
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:10,898
Oh, my, my. Those poor children.

872
00:55:11,060 --> 00:55:13,255
You don't have any backup records?

873
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:16,130
Well, we've never had
something like this happen.

874
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,452
I'm sure that they'll turn up. I mean, after
all, where could they have possibly gone?

875
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,657
Failure to administrate backup records.

876
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:24,935
That would be strike two.

877
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:29,056
Look, this is probably
none of my business...

878
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,529
...but I'm a little concerned about Fred.

879
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:36,134
Well, I appreciate your concern,
Mr. Northcutt, but he is fine.

880
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,849
It's just that I've seen these
kind of things before. The little lies...

881
00:55:40,460 --> 00:55:41,734
...flashes of anger.

882
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,416
No, I can assure you, he's fine.

883
00:55:45,620 --> 00:55:48,418
Well, but it could get
so much worse, Santa.

884
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,697
Tell me, has he asked for
large sums of money recently?

885
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:54,579
And what about trouble?

886
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,250
Has he gotten into trouble with the law?

887
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,775
Why, yes, Mr. Northcutt, yes, he has.

888
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,979
Of course. He's crying out for help.

889
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:06,415
And if someone doesn't
step in and help him, why...

890
00:56:06,580 --> 00:56:08,411
...I'm afraid it's gonna get ugly.

891
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:11,578
Well, what can I do, Mr. Northcutt?

892
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:15,934
I did have a thought.
But Fred's not going to like it.

893
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,335
What kind of party
are you dudes throwing?

894
00:56:34,700 --> 00:56:38,295
Airmail it! Airmail it to me right now!
Let's get jacked up!

895
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:22,014
What are you, nuts? I feel like
Patty Hearst! I was just abducted, Nick!

896
00:57:22,180 --> 00:57:23,818
You're gonna have to pay something...

897
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,136
...to make up for the hurt
I have inside of me.

898
00:57:26,300 --> 00:57:30,179
It's not gonna be cheap. I got a lawyer
that's got vowels in his last name, Nick.

899
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:35,016
He's gonna contact you and make you
feel the hurt I feel from your handlers!

900
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:37,774
Frederick!
We're having a family intervention.

901
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:40,500
Your behavior has been unacceptable.

902
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:47,577
- Wanda, hi.
- Hi. You all right?

903
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,857
I'm doing terrific. I'm doing great.
How've you been?

904
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:54,057
You know, I've been all right.
Yeah, I've been working and...

905
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:58,452
That's awesome. Work is really good for
someone to do when they're doing stuff.

906
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,930
I've been working a lot, too, by the way.
And also fighting for my life.

907
00:58:04,860 --> 00:58:06,930
My brother's Santa Claus.

908
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:11,098
Yeah, yeah. I can... I can see that.

909
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,457
It's a little different.

910
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:17,054
Yeah, the whole thing's been
a little bit unusual.

911
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:20,737
Fred, your brother has flown
someone in we think can help you.

912
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:23,011
- This is Dr. Goldfarb.
- Hello.

913
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:26,172
Your erratic behavior is putting
too much stress on your brother.

914
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:30,128
Mom, for Pete's sake, okay,
I'm not stressed out about it.

915
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,131
- Nick! You're falling apart.
- I am not.

916
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,256
Yes, you are.
You're dangerously overweight.

917
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,569
He is not!

918
00:58:35,740 --> 00:58:38,300
You have no idea
what your son is going through!

919
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:40,974
- Okay.
- He is a terrible closet eater.

920
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:44,450
He has developed
acid reflux and sleep apnea.

921
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:47,578
- I snore. I mean, people snore.
- It is keeping him up all night...

922
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:51,289
...and it's affecting his health, not to
mention other aspects of our marriage.

923
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:52,609
Oh, ho, ho, Annette.

924
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:54,896
He's having a tough time
getting off the ground?

925
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,729
I'm just saying.

926
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,418
Please, let's just cut to the chase.

927
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,048
It's simple, it's always
the same thing with you, Fred.

928
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:05,491
- You cause problems.
- Sweetie...

929
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:06,928
And then you make excuses...

930
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:09,853
...like, you know, you're looking
out for someone else.

931
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,419
Ever since he was a little boy.

932
00:59:11,580 --> 00:59:14,970
I couldn't have said it any better.
Freddie, that is what you do.

933
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,371
That's great. Do me a favor, please.
Why don't you just stay out of this?

934
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:21,008
Well, I came for the intervention.
Your family asked me.

935
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:23,933
Don't you have a date with a guy
who forgot to plug his meter?

936
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,658
Have you been spying on me?

937
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,458
- Yes.
- You got nothing better to do?

938
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,259
- I don't like what I saw.
- lf you spied on me properly...

939
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:33,139
...you would know I didn't end up going
out with that guy.

940
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:36,736
Let me just say this to you.
It is not flattering on your character...

941
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,334
...to see you with a man
who's got liver-spotted hands.

942
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,809
It's a very weak choice.
It makes you look weak.

943
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:43,857
Look, I can tell you
what your problem is.

944
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:47,376
You won't let anybody love you because
you don't think you're worth loving.

945
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,689
If it pleases the court...

946
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,374
...did you have an older gentleman
ask you out on a date?

947
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:54,054
Yes, but that's not the point!
I didn't see him again!

948
00:59:54,220 --> 00:59:56,575
- Then she's a dater.
- You push and fix on one thing.

949
00:59:56,740 --> 00:59:58,458
Then stop dating. Put down the phone.

950
00:59:58,620 --> 01:00:00,099
That's it. I've had enough.

951
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:04,094
Excuse me, Mr. Santa Claus. It's been
very pleasant to come to the North Pole...

952
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,818
...and, yeah.

953
01:00:05,980 --> 01:00:08,619
Go find a date. Maybe get lucky
with an elf on the way out.

954
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:10,133
Good luck. Hope it goes well.

955
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:13,497
Well, there's a lot of mistletoe
out there, so you should be psyched.

956
01:00:13,660 --> 01:00:14,729
Fred.

957
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,137
I think we're making some real progress.

958
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:22,929
You wanna know what the good news is
about all of this? Tomorrow's my last day.

959
01:00:23,100 --> 01:00:24,613
We don't have to have therapy.

960
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:28,819
It's for people who want to be in each
other's lives. We don't have that problem.

961
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:31,892
I'm gonna finish my job,
I'll be out of your lives forever.

962
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:44,375
Nice night.

963
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,179
Get lost, guy.

964
01:00:48,620 --> 01:00:52,135
Santa Claus' brother,
that must be a tough beat.

965
01:00:52,780 --> 01:00:54,975
My brother's a doctor.
I never hear the end of it.

966
01:00:55,140 --> 01:00:57,700
Half the time,
I feel like I don't even exist.

967
01:00:57,860 --> 01:01:00,135
And the way your whole family
treats you.

968
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:02,858
What's your story, man?

969
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,449
Excuse me?

970
01:01:05,420 --> 01:01:08,571
Look, whatever you're trying to do
with me here's not gonna work.

971
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,856
Well, what exactly am I trying?

972
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:15,059
I don't know what it is you're into, but
something's real creepy about you...

973
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:16,733
...and ever since you got here...

974
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,130
...my brother's been getting
a little bit nervous.

975
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:20,699
That's wonderful.

976
01:01:22,060 --> 01:01:23,288
What is wonderful?

977
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:25,690
You take an interest
in your brother's well-being.

978
01:01:25,860 --> 01:01:28,169
Of course you do.
I'm sure he does the same for you.

979
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,773
- Clyde...
- You ever seen a tree...

980
01:01:29,940 --> 01:01:31,931
...that grows in the shadow
of another tree?

981
01:01:32,100 --> 01:01:35,536
It's all puny and misshapen because
it's just bending and twisting...

982
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:38,373
...trying so desperately
to get some sunlight.

983
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:42,650
If somebody just cut off a few feet
of that big tree...

984
01:01:42,820 --> 01:01:44,617
...that little tree could grow up strong.

985
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:47,214
But no, that's not the way
life works, right?

986
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,852
They all love that big tree, right?
They're all proud of that one.

987
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:53,534
They hate the crap out of
the little one next to it.

988
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,093
The little tree that refuses to grow right.

989
01:01:57,620 --> 01:02:00,930
And you know what? Till somebody comes
along and cuts down that big tree...

990
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:04,729
...that little tree is never
gonna get any light. Any light.

991
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,535
I'm sorry.
I don't know where that came from.

992
01:02:13,060 --> 01:02:14,288
Christmas.

993
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:15,779
Have a nice night.

994
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,538
What the hell was that?

995
01:02:35,980 --> 01:02:39,052
Looks like a new kid just took over
the number one Most Naughty spot.

996
01:02:44,580 --> 01:02:45,615
Slam?

997
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:49,930
Samuel Gibbons, Chicago, Illinois.

998
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:56,738
What are you asking Santa for?

999
01:02:57,100 --> 01:02:59,694
- A family.
- I'm asking for a family too.

1000
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:04,814
Santa's not bringing y'all families.
Santa Claus is a clown.

1001
01:03:04,980 --> 01:03:06,459
He's a fame junkie.

1002
01:03:06,660 --> 01:03:08,571
<i>He puts on a big red suit...</i>

1003
01:03:08,740 --> 01:03:10,856
...and rides around the town
with reindeer.

1004
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:13,416
It's because the man
is desperate for attention.

1005
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,457
<i>The dude needs to be in the spotlight.</i>

1006
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:19,818
<i>There's more Santa statues in the</i>
<i>world than Buddha. It's a shell game.</i>

1007
01:03:19,980 --> 01:03:21,572
Y'all drank all the Kool-Aid, fools!

1008
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:25,369
You just know you're never
getting adopted because you're mean!

1009
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:30,498
- Break it up! You're gonna get in trouble!
- Get off me! Get off!

1010
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:33,613
- Break it up! Break it up!
- Get off!

1011
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,577
Somebody's gonna get in trouble!

1012
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,856
<i>I don 't care. I'm Slam!</i>

1013
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,016
Santa, I ran the numbers three times.

1014
01:04:30,580 --> 01:04:31,933
Yeah.

1015
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,375
Charlene, mention this to no one.

1016
01:04:34,700 --> 01:04:37,692
- Especially Clyde Northcutt.
- Yes, sir.

1017
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,295
Fred!

1018
01:04:44,100 --> 01:04:46,375
What the blazes have you done?

1019
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:50,249
You marked every naughty child as nice!

1020
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,819
Are you out of your mind?

1021
01:04:51,980 --> 01:04:54,619
- None of the kids seemed naughty to me.
- Good grief, Fred!

1022
01:04:54,780 --> 01:04:57,738
You really never see the ramifications
of anything, do you?

1023
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:01,490
We literally cannot make enough
presents with only three days left.

1024
01:05:01,660 --> 01:05:04,299
We cannot deliver all of those presents!

1025
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:07,532
Do you see? It's over.
Congratulations, Fred!

1026
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:10,692
You've cost Christmas
for the whole planet! Everybody!

1027
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:14,136
Lithuania, everywhere in Africa,
the whole thing!

1028
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,653
Right down the crapper!

1029
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,813
Blame it all on me, right?
It's all my fault. How convenient.

1030
01:05:18,980 --> 01:05:22,734
Annette was right about you.
Mom was right about you!

1031
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,128
You know what, save it!

1032
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,575
Maybe you should look
at your own self for a change!

1033
01:05:26,740 --> 01:05:30,653
You just keep stuffing your face
with gingerbread! Fat boy!

1034
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:40,417
You slick-talking, fast-talking punk!

1035
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:45,574
You know I've been battling a weight
problem for years, Fred! That is not funny!

1036
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:48,300
You know what?
You can shove it, Thunder Thighs!

1037
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:51,133
I'm sick of it. This little tree's
gonna get some light.

1038
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:53,291
This tree's gonna chop
that big tree down!

1039
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:55,018
I don't have to take your abuse!

1040
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:56,898
Nick, I couldn't miss you if I tried!

1041
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:59,699
I couldn't miss you if I tried
because you're so fat!

1042
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:03,296
You throw like a girl,
like a big, leather jacket-wearing girl.

1043
01:06:03,460 --> 01:06:04,973
Come on, Nick.

1044
01:06:05,140 --> 01:06:07,210
Come on, fat boy!

1045
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,098
How'd you get to work today? You roll?

1046
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,252
How'd you get here? Did you steal
a sled from some little kid?

1047
01:06:12,940 --> 01:06:14,089
Come on!

1048
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,251
Good night, sweet prince.

1049
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:42,457
Don't bring a snowmobile
to a snowball fight, Nick!

1050
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,814
You gonna run me over?
Are you gonna run me over?

1051
01:07:22,420 --> 01:07:24,809
I never realized it before.

1052
01:07:29,020 --> 01:07:30,169
You hate me.

1053
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:34,256
I don't hate you, Nick.

1054
01:07:37,140 --> 01:07:39,017
I just wish you were never born.

1055
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:44,293
Yeah.

1056
01:07:58,300 --> 01:08:03,169
Clyde Northcutt is not from
Human Resources, Fred.

1057
01:08:04,460 --> 01:08:06,416
He's an efficiency expert.

1058
01:08:08,300 --> 01:08:12,498
And he is one strike away
from shutting me down.

1059
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,733
Permanently.

1060
01:08:41,260 --> 01:08:43,251
Well, I hope you're happy
with yourself, Fred.

1061
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:45,570
Look, Annette, I want my money.
A deal's a deal.

1062
01:08:47,340 --> 01:08:49,092
Yeah.

1063
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,615
Personally,
I don't think you deserve a cent.

1064
01:08:54,220 --> 01:08:56,654
He wanted you to have this too.

1065
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:01,859
Merry Christmas, Fred.

1066
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,133
Let's go, Willie.

1067
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:14,419
Well, well.

1068
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:19,091
Mr. Northcutt.

1069
01:09:20,620 --> 01:09:21,939
You wanted to see me, sir.

1070
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:23,089
Yes, I did.

1071
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:26,139
Bring up Fred Claus
from earlier today, please.

1072
01:09:46,660 --> 01:09:49,572
Well, now, we can correct that.
We can correct that.

1073
01:09:49,740 --> 01:09:52,937
Charlene. We still have
plenty of time, don't we?

1074
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:55,295
With less than three days
to go until Christmas...

1075
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,849
...you now have no way
of making your quota.

1076
01:09:58,220 --> 01:10:01,451
And I think you know what that means.

1077
01:10:01,620 --> 01:10:04,180
Strike three.

1078
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:09,098
Look, it gives me no great pleasure
to have to say this, but...

1079
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:13,333
Well, actually, who am I kidding,
this is a fantastic moment for me!

1080
01:10:30,300 --> 01:10:32,097
You're fired.

1081
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:43,176
<i>Hey, Fred, it's Leon. It's the 22nd.</i>
<i>This is your big day, buddy!</i>

1082
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:46,730
<i>Get that 50 G's in my hands!</i>
<i>Call me back. Let's do this.</i>

1083
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:41,375
And I feel this way all the time. It's not
like I didn't want my brother to succeed.

1084
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:44,657
We were very close growing up.
I mean, we shared bunk beds.

1085
01:11:44,820 --> 01:11:46,890
He was my roadie,
used to carry my amps.

1086
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:49,814
And my mother always told me,
since I was a little kid:

1087
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:53,734
"You're gonna support your brother."
And so that was gonna be my job.

1088
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:57,893
And then <i>Rocky</i> came out,
and things changed, you know?

1089
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,255
I was the first guy in line.
I mean, I was there.

1090
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,854
And then when <i>Rocky III</i> came out...

1091
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,739
...I was starting to wonder who
Frank Stallone was, you know?

1092
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:07,413
It was, like, identity theft.

1093
01:12:07,580 --> 01:12:09,810
You're fighting Rambo
and you're fighting Rocky...

1094
01:12:09,980 --> 01:12:13,211
...and trying to keep them at bay
so you can get you to come through.

1095
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:16,737
Well, anyway, I wanna
thank you guys for listening.

1096
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,175
I feel good coming here. I like it here.

1097
01:12:19,340 --> 01:12:22,298
Wonderful. Thanks for sharing, Frank.

1098
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:26,135
Okay. Now, I think we go to Roger.

1099
01:12:26,660 --> 01:12:29,572
I actually have some things
I'd like to talk about if...

1100
01:12:29,740 --> 01:12:32,049
Okay, you're just gonna have
to wait your turn.

1101
01:12:32,220 --> 01:12:35,849
Roger's been waiting, and we didn't get
to him last time, so we'll go to Roger.

1102
01:12:36,020 --> 01:12:39,808
- I have a lot of stuff boiling now, so...
- I appreciate that. After Roger.

1103
01:12:40,580 --> 01:12:43,014
- Okay.
- Roger?

1104
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,451
I'm Roger, I'm a recovering sibling.

1105
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:47,258
Hi, Roger.

1106
01:12:47,420 --> 01:12:49,058
My brother's Bill Clinton.

1107
01:12:50,140 --> 01:12:52,608
My brother was the
president of the United States.

1108
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,693
You know, I was flipping
through the channels on the TV...

1109
01:12:55,860 --> 01:13:01,014
...and on the History Channel was the
State of the Union Address from 1993.

1110
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:06,129
When we left the White House, I thought
it was gonna be the first step to recovery.

1111
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:10,050
But no, I started to cry again.

1112
01:13:10,780 --> 01:13:16,093
And I just don't know if I'm ever, you
know, gonna be able to fully recover now.

1113
01:13:16,260 --> 01:13:19,570
Maybe that's a place where I could
jump in, share what's going on with me.

1114
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:21,776
- Who are you?
- I'm Fred.

1115
01:13:21,940 --> 01:13:24,454
- Hi, Fred.
- Hi.

1116
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,051
Go ahead.
Would you like to take a turn now?

1117
01:13:27,580 --> 01:13:30,458
- My name is Fred Claus.
- Hi, Fred.

1118
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:32,369
Hi.

1119
01:13:35,740 --> 01:13:37,458
I'm Santa Claus' brother.

1120
01:13:38,220 --> 01:13:41,656
And I got a lot of stuff
going on because of it.

1121
01:13:41,940 --> 01:13:46,138
There's a lot of things...
There's a lot of juice in the tank over it.

1122
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:48,814
- And...
- Is this a joke to you?

1123
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:51,130
- Stephen, by the way.
- Hi, Stephen.

1124
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:52,449
Hey, guys, what's up?

1125
01:13:52,620 --> 01:13:56,852
I mean, because this isn't funny
to all of us here in the group.

1126
01:13:57,020 --> 01:13:58,897
Okay, this is very serious to us.

1127
01:13:59,060 --> 01:14:02,575
And I'm feeling very uncomfortable
with where you're coming from.

1128
01:14:02,740 --> 01:14:04,810
Wait, Stephen...

1129
01:14:04,980 --> 01:14:08,211
...maybe to him,
his brother is Santa Claus.

1130
01:14:08,420 --> 01:14:09,978
Feel like my brother's Santa Claus.

1131
01:14:10,140 --> 01:14:14,213
But I feel like my brother's Santa Claus
because my brother really is Santa Claus.

1132
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:17,053
All right, that's enough, all right!
You and I got a problem!

1133
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:21,095
Stephen, easy, easy.
All right. Stephen, easy.

1134
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:24,775
That's not Alec, okay?

1135
01:14:24,940 --> 01:14:26,612
Don't look at me, look at him.

1136
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:28,894
That's not Alec.

1137
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:30,369
That's not Alec.

1138
01:14:30,860 --> 01:14:32,691
I'm not Alec, you know what I mean?

1139
01:14:32,860 --> 01:14:34,418
All right, let's stomp it out.

1140
01:14:34,580 --> 01:14:36,377
- It's not Alec.
- Alec's not gonna hear.

1141
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:37,575
How's he gonna...?

1142
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:40,089
- That's not Alec.
- Okay, that's not Alec.

1143
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,137
- That's not Alec!
- That's not Alec!

1144
01:14:42,420 --> 01:14:44,650
- That's not Alec!
- All right!

1145
01:14:44,820 --> 01:14:48,779
Now that you've got Alec's attention,
Stephen, what do you wanna tell him?

1146
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:54,136
Stephen, I think I know
where you're coming from...

1147
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:57,019
...because I used to be really,
really angry with my brother.

1148
01:14:57,580 --> 01:15:02,176
I didn't want to become first brother,
especially for the rest of my life.

1149
01:15:02,340 --> 01:15:05,810
I couldn't control being brother
of the president of the United States.

1150
01:15:06,300 --> 01:15:09,417
But I could control
being Bill Clinton's brother.

1151
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:13,016
And I made the decision, even though
I could have brought the house down...

1152
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,695
...I made the decision that,
for the love of my brother...

1153
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,328
...and for the love of my family name...

1154
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,370
...that I was gonna do whatever it took...

1155
01:15:23,460 --> 01:15:25,496
...because I loved my brother...

1156
01:15:25,660 --> 01:15:29,812
...and I was always gonna be there
for my brother. And I have been.

1157
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:31,652
And you know what?

1158
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,219
You can be too.

1159
01:15:38,980 --> 01:15:40,618
The Travel Experts?

1160
01:15:40,780 --> 01:15:43,817
Yeah. I need to get to the
North Pole right away, like, tonight.

1161
01:15:45,500 --> 01:15:48,298
Yeah, I got $50,000 in cash
that says I'm not kidding.

1162
01:16:07,620 --> 01:16:10,532
- Oh, North Pole! North Pole.
- North Pole is there?

1163
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:12,418
Safe journeys to you, and thank you!

1164
01:16:40,620 --> 01:16:44,613
Willie, gather all the elves and meet me
in the Workshop right now. Let's go.

1165
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,219
Look, guys...

1166
01:16:49,460 --> 01:16:53,339
...we gotta make as many presents
as we can in the next 10 hours.

1167
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:54,774
Fred, it's Christmas Eve.

1168
01:16:54,940 --> 01:17:00,014
It's impossible. We just can't build
that many toys in that time.

1169
01:17:00,180 --> 01:17:02,694
The rule says that every kid gets a toy.

1170
01:17:02,860 --> 01:17:06,933
So, what would be the easiest toy
to make? One for boys and one for girls.

1171
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:09,216
- A baseball bat.
- A Hula-Hoop.

1172
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:11,894
Well, baseball bats
and Hula-Hoops it is, then.

1173
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:16,134
Charlene, do you think it's possible we
can make enough gifts to meet our quota?

1174
01:17:16,300 --> 01:17:19,292
Baseball bats, lose four seconds, 55...

1175
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:22,931
Yeah, it is possible.

1176
01:17:23,140 --> 01:17:26,257
It is, but, Fred, that's not what
the kids asked for.

1177
01:17:26,540 --> 01:17:29,737
Yeah, but all that matters is that each
of the kids get a toy.

1178
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:33,779
That they have something that they can
open when they wake up in the morning.

1179
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:37,774
Most importantly, they all know there's
somebody who's thinking about them.

1180
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,573
You guys have never missed
a Christmas before.

1181
01:17:42,380 --> 01:17:45,099
If you guys are gonna go out this year...

1182
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:48,736
...you're gonna go out trying.

1183
01:18:07,820 --> 01:18:09,731
Okay. We're on it.

1184
01:18:10,660 --> 01:18:12,651
- I've never seen him...
- That's because he's...

1185
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:15,334
...thrown his back out.
- No.

1186
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,695
- Hey, Annette, how you doing?
- Fred.

1187
01:18:17,900 --> 01:18:21,495
Nick, I think we're gonna make it. I got
elves in the Workshop making presents.

1188
01:18:21,660 --> 01:18:23,855
We're cutting corners,
but I think we can make it.

1189
01:18:24,020 --> 01:18:27,057
You'll still be able to save Christmas.
We don't have a lot of time.

1190
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:30,690
That's impossible. The man
can hardly carry his own weight.

1191
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:32,652
I can't move.

1192
01:18:34,860 --> 01:18:36,816
I can't, Fred.

1193
01:18:37,900 --> 01:18:39,652
You can do it. It's Christmas, come on.

1194
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:43,893
- The kids are out there, counting on us.
- Oh, boy, I wish I could.

1195
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,698
Willie, this is your big night.
This is your big night, pal.

1196
01:18:48,860 --> 01:18:50,930
You're gonna deliver the presents.
Willie can.

1197
01:18:51,100 --> 01:18:52,772
No, Fred, I can't.

1198
01:18:52,940 --> 01:18:55,010
Of course you can.
You're great on that sleigh.

1199
01:18:55,180 --> 01:18:58,138
No, no, you don't understand.
I can't do it. There's a rule.

1200
01:18:58,300 --> 01:19:01,417
Only a Claus can deliver the presents.

1201
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:14,857
Do you guys mind giving me just a
moment alone with my brother here?

1202
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:22,689
Yeah.

1203
01:19:26,020 --> 01:19:28,978
I can't do that, Nick.
I think you know that.

1204
01:19:31,740 --> 01:19:35,130
I'm not capable.
I'm not even comfortable flying...

1205
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,894
...or being a passenger,
let alone trying to fly the sleigh.

1206
01:19:38,060 --> 01:19:40,654
- I don't know my way around reindeer...
- Hey, Fred.

1207
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,573
It's all right.

1208
01:19:45,140 --> 01:19:49,179
It's ridiculous for anybody to expect
that kind of thing. No.

1209
01:19:49,940 --> 01:19:51,896
You can't do that. You can't.

1210
01:19:52,980 --> 01:19:55,778
It's too huge. Believe me, I know.

1211
01:20:00,980 --> 01:20:03,574
And I would never ask you
to do that, Fred.

1212
01:20:05,820 --> 01:20:07,651
It's all right.

1213
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,492
It is all right.

1214
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:27,815
Nick, there's been one thing that's been
eating at me since I've been here.

1215
01:20:28,460 --> 01:20:30,894
That Naughty-Nice List that you got?

1216
01:20:32,620 --> 01:20:34,736
There's no naughty kids, Nick.

1217
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,979
They're all good kids.

1218
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:39,531
But some of them are scared.

1219
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:41,930
And some of them don't feel listened to.

1220
01:20:42,140 --> 01:20:44,779
Some of them had some
pretty tough breaks too.

1221
01:20:47,660 --> 01:20:50,379
But every kid deserves
a present on Christmas.

1222
01:21:27,460 --> 01:21:29,416
Yeah.

1223
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:47,691
Africa plus Asia, plus Europe,
North America, South America.

1224
01:21:47,860 --> 01:21:49,179
It's gonna be close.

1225
01:21:49,340 --> 01:21:51,331
Let's go, people! Let's pick up the pace!

1226
01:22:03,820 --> 01:22:07,335
Red Fred has entered the building. I
repeat, Red Fred has entered the building.

1227
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:09,650
Willie, let's go.

1228
01:22:21,380 --> 01:22:25,214
What the heck's going on around here?
Little elves. You can't trust them at all!

1229
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:26,415
The little tiny people.

1230
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:31,135
Nice outfit. What the heck
do you think you're doing?

1231
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:32,779
- Delivering presents.
- Oh, no.

1232
01:22:32,940 --> 01:22:34,692
Santa is the only one who can deliver.

1233
01:22:34,860 --> 01:22:37,328
Only a Claus can deliver presents
and that is a Claus.

1234
01:22:37,740 --> 01:22:41,289
If you think I'm gonna let you get away
with this, you are sadly mistaken.

1235
01:22:41,740 --> 01:22:44,698
If you don't get out of the way
of this sleigh in three seconds...

1236
01:22:44,860 --> 01:22:46,771
...I'll be the happiest guy
in the North Pole.

1237
01:22:46,940 --> 01:22:49,056
You don't have the guts.

1238
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:50,369
Okay.

1239
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,938
Three...

1240
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:54,659
...two...

1241
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:56,697
- Willie, how do I do this?
- Just say "ho."

1242
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:05,769
- Good, Fred! Nice firm grip on those reins!
- What's happening now?

1243
01:23:05,940 --> 01:23:09,410
Snap those reins, we gotta get this thing
in the air! Tell the guys to get up!

1244
01:23:09,580 --> 01:23:10,569
Get up, get up, get up!

1245
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:15,572
There you go! You got it, Fred!
We're going up!

1246
01:23:15,900 --> 01:23:19,529
- You're flying Santa's sleigh!
- We're flying. Now what's happening?

1247
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:21,418
- Watch the roof there.
- I can't do it!

1248
01:23:24,460 --> 01:23:26,371
Do it to me, how do I steer this thing?

1249
01:23:26,540 --> 01:23:29,577
We wanna go up! So you gotta
pull up on the reins there, Fred!

1250
01:23:29,740 --> 01:23:31,173
Okay.

1251
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,657
Christmas One, do you copy?

1252
01:23:46,820 --> 01:23:50,495
<i>North Pole, this is Christmas One.</i>
<i>We copy. We hear you loud and clear.</i>

1253
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:53,732
Sixty seconds and counting
for a landing, North Pole.

1254
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:55,492
Okay, we've got 10 hours, Fred.

1255
01:23:55,660 --> 01:23:59,175
We need to be done delivering
by 5:38 a.m. North Pole time.

1256
01:23:59,340 --> 01:24:01,296
That's sunrise, and that's game over.

1257
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,212
Going down this thing here, it's...

1258
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,092
It's gonna hurt a bit, isn't it?

1259
01:24:06,300 --> 01:24:08,450
I'm not gonna lie to you.
It ain't gonna tickle.

1260
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:11,538
Oh, and one more thing,
make sure you eat all the cookies.

1261
01:24:11,700 --> 01:24:14,658
- It hurts people's feelings if you don't.
- I got it.

1262
01:24:33,500 --> 01:24:35,331
Head 12 degrees north into London.

1263
01:24:35,660 --> 01:24:39,096
North Pole, this is Christmas One. We're
heading 12 degrees north into London.

1264
01:24:40,140 --> 01:24:41,209
Stephen Harding.

1265
01:24:43,420 --> 01:24:44,819
<i>Anna-Marie Gormley.</i>

1266
01:24:46,020 --> 01:24:47,089
Done.

1267
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:52,533
Emma Short.

1268
01:24:59,140 --> 01:25:01,290
We'll come back to this
neighborhood later.

1269
01:25:04,660 --> 01:25:06,696
Go 20 degrees past Dallas
towards Lubbock.

1270
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,379
Roger that, North Pole.

1271
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:23,294
Christmas One, take your
heading off one-zero-niner.

1272
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:27,218
Fred, Fred, Fred!

1273
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,819
- Shake it off, Rudolph!
- You sure you've never done this?

1274
01:25:31,980 --> 01:25:34,892
You're driving like an absolute pro
who makes a lot of mistakes.

1275
01:25:40,580 --> 01:25:44,209
Oh, it's okay. Friendly, friendly, friendly.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

1276
01:25:44,700 --> 01:25:45,769
Katherine Tibbett.

1277
01:25:45,940 --> 01:25:48,898
<i>Christmas One, veer right 70 degrees</i>
<i>at the Empire State Building.</i>

1278
01:26:13,220 --> 01:26:14,289
Next page.

1279
01:26:26,060 --> 01:26:27,095
Have a slice of challah.

1280
01:26:27,260 --> 01:26:29,933
Thank you so much.
I appreciate it. Mazel tov.

1281
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:32,489
And that knish?
Let me just have one of these.

1282
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:35,174
It's hard to pass these beauties up.
You're too generous.

1283
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:40,979
Kid.

1284
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:46,212
Santa! You found me!

1285
01:26:46,380 --> 01:26:47,608
Yeah, I found you.

1286
01:26:48,620 --> 01:26:50,690
I find all the good kids.

1287
01:26:52,380 --> 01:26:54,336
Macaroni! It's you!

1288
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:55,899
Hi, boy.

1289
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:58,377
Come on, boy. Hi.

1290
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:00,292
Slam, I want you to listen to me...

1291
01:27:01,580 --> 01:27:05,539
...you got some advice a while back,
and I think it was a little off.

1292
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:09,412
The world is what you make it.

1293
01:27:10,660 --> 01:27:13,128
It all starts with what
you make of yourself.

1294
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:17,452
And I want you to
believe in yourself, Slam...

1295
01:27:17,620 --> 01:27:19,497
...because you got a lot to believe in.

1296
01:27:21,660 --> 01:27:25,209
And the rest will all...
All kind of fall into place.

1297
01:27:25,380 --> 01:27:27,655
- Okay?
- Okay.

1298
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,773
Merry Christmas, pal.

1299
01:27:31,140 --> 01:27:32,493
Merry Christmas, Santa.

1300
01:27:32,940 --> 01:27:36,216
- Oh, and Santa?
- Yeah.

1301
01:27:36,420 --> 01:27:37,899
Here's your wallet back.

1302
01:27:42,740 --> 01:27:43,968
That's a good start.

1303
01:27:44,140 --> 01:27:46,938
Let's try and build some
real momentum with that, okay?

1304
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,135
Okay.

1305
01:27:55,060 --> 01:27:56,493
I think we're gonna make it!

1306
01:27:59,500 --> 01:28:01,650
Christmas One, are you there? Over.

1307
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:03,454
Are you there...?

1308
01:28:07,740 --> 01:28:09,810
North Pole, go ahead,
this is Christmas One.

1309
01:28:11,020 --> 01:28:14,535
Good luck finding your way
in the dark without a candle, Freddie.

1310
01:28:14,700 --> 01:28:19,569
And as of right now, each and every one
of you little adorable munchkins is fired!

1311
01:28:19,740 --> 01:28:22,049
So go home, pack up your stockings.

1312
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:25,337
You're taking a bus back to Elfistan
or wherever the hell you're from.

1313
01:28:25,500 --> 01:28:26,535
North Pole?

1314
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:30,014
North Pole, this is Christmas One,
go ahead.

1315
01:28:30,180 --> 01:28:31,408
Hey, guys!

1316
01:28:34,340 --> 01:28:36,137
I think we're flying blind up here.

1317
01:29:01,540 --> 01:29:05,055
By the time the sun rises,
it will all be over.

1318
01:29:06,260 --> 01:29:07,613
See you in the morning.

1319
01:29:08,700 --> 01:29:12,295
Clyde Archibald Northcutt...

1320
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:15,896
...422 Dashwood Drive...

1321
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,291
...Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

1322
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:26,055
Yeah, you made
the Most-Naughty list in '68.

1323
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,780
Oh, boy, that was a very,
very naughty year.

1324
01:29:28,940 --> 01:29:32,171
- How could you possibly remember that?
- You asked me for a Superman cape.

1325
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:36,054
But I didn't give you
a Superman cape, did I?

1326
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:43,449
- Did you always wear glasses, Clyde?
- lf you think this changes anything...

1327
01:29:43,620 --> 01:29:45,133
Four-Eyed Clyde.

1328
01:29:45,460 --> 01:29:48,452
- I bet that's what they called you.
- I don't know what you're talk...

1329
01:29:48,620 --> 01:29:52,579
Oh, and do you think that after a while
of being called Four-Eyed Clyde...

1330
01:29:52,740 --> 01:29:54,378
...you maybe got a little angry?

1331
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:58,415
Maybe you started a fight or two.
Maybe 10, maybe 12.

1332
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:04,340
So you asked me for something.

1333
01:30:04,500 --> 01:30:05,694
A Superman cape.

1334
01:30:06,220 --> 01:30:09,212
Because you thought that that
was gonna change everything.

1335
01:30:09,380 --> 01:30:10,369
This is ridiculous.

1336
01:30:10,540 --> 01:30:13,737
- So you decide to stay Four-Eyed Clyde?
- Because Clark Kent wore glasses!

1337
01:30:14,220 --> 01:30:16,256
But when he turned into Superman...

1338
01:30:17,620 --> 01:30:20,771
...he didn't need those
darn glasses anymore, did he?

1339
01:30:22,340 --> 01:30:24,092
Oh, Clyde.

1340
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:29,257
It was wrong of me
not to give you that gift, Clyde.

1341
01:30:29,420 --> 01:30:33,572
I fear that I had a very incorrect...

1342
01:30:33,740 --> 01:30:36,459
...misguided understanding of...

1343
01:30:38,020 --> 01:30:39,419
...naughty children.

1344
01:30:42,500 --> 01:30:46,175
So this may be a little late.

1345
01:31:00,660 --> 01:31:01,695
You wanna put it on?

1346
01:31:04,020 --> 01:31:06,056
Mr. Claus, I'm a 45-year-old man,
I'm not...

1347
01:31:06,220 --> 01:31:07,494
Put it on.

1348
01:31:09,060 --> 01:31:10,413
For me.

1349
01:31:11,420 --> 01:31:13,092
- Okay.
- Thattaboy.

1350
01:31:17,820 --> 01:31:18,969
Glasses off.

1351
01:31:28,180 --> 01:31:29,659
Now, I need your help.

1352
01:31:34,500 --> 01:31:35,979
Do you know what you're doing?

1353
01:31:36,940 --> 01:31:39,170
Quarter to 2 a.m. There's Ursa Minor.

1354
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:42,855
That means we should be
at longitude 38.25. That's four...

1355
01:31:43,020 --> 01:31:44,533
Take a left! Take a left!

1356
01:31:47,900 --> 01:31:49,970
I really, really need your help.

1357
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:53,934
I'm gonna need you to
turn the power back on, Superman.

1358
01:31:55,660 --> 01:31:57,730
Now, I know that you can do this.

1359
01:31:57,900 --> 01:32:01,575
You have to understand, I've already
submitted my report. It's final.

1360
01:32:01,740 --> 01:32:04,300
If Fred doesn't deliver
all those presents by sunrise...

1361
01:32:04,460 --> 01:32:07,179
...the North Pole will be shut down
forever. There's nothing...

1362
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:09,808
I understand that. I do.

1363
01:32:09,980 --> 01:32:12,210
But what do you say we give him
his shot?

1364
01:32:14,060 --> 01:32:16,335
Because he's not a naughty kid either.

1365
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:17,694
I'm trying to... Hold on!

1366
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:20,420
Just look outside!
That looks like the Grand Canyon!

1367
01:32:20,580 --> 01:32:21,615
Isn't that it?

1368
01:32:38,180 --> 01:32:39,329
Oh, boy.

1369
01:32:50,340 --> 01:32:51,329
Fred, it's 4: 15.

1370
01:32:51,500 --> 01:32:54,139
Look, I'm gonna tuck and go
as fast as I can, all right?

1371
01:33:03,460 --> 01:33:04,449
Done, done.

1372
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:13,255
Snap the reins!
We need more speed at this altitude!

1373
01:33:13,420 --> 01:33:15,854
- Going as fast as I can! Say when to turn!
- Now!

1374
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:26,849
Fred.

1375
01:33:27,020 --> 01:33:29,250
I know, Willie, I know.

1376
01:33:44,700 --> 01:33:47,260
Fred, I have a bad feeling about this.

1377
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:02,569
We did it.

1378
01:35:16,380 --> 01:35:17,495
Willie.

1379
01:35:27,380 --> 01:35:29,336
To the snowglobe!

1380
01:37:23,660 --> 01:37:29,690
You are the best big brother
anybody could ever ask for.

1381
01:37:58,260 --> 01:38:01,457
- Fred?
- I brought you a Christmas gift.

1382
01:38:01,620 --> 01:38:02,894
How'd you get in?

1383
01:38:03,060 --> 01:38:05,096
I came down the chimney.

1384
01:38:05,260 --> 01:38:08,138
Freddie, you can't just show up
dressed like Father Christmas...

1385
01:38:08,300 --> 01:38:10,291
...and come down
somebody else's chimney.

1386
01:38:10,460 --> 01:38:12,849
Actually, I can.
I've been doing that all night.

1387
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:17,688
Freddie, do you know what? I'm starting
to get a bit worried for you, right now...

1388
01:38:17,860 --> 01:38:21,933
...because like you're standing here,
in my bedroom, wearing red.

1389
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,817
And, you know, it's getting like to be
sort of restraining order time.

1390
01:38:25,980 --> 01:38:28,574
So, you look sort of tired and I know
that I'm very tired.

1391
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:32,176
So maybe I'll call you later, but right now
I think you should just go home.

1392
01:38:32,340 --> 01:38:33,489
All right? Just go home.

1393
01:38:34,620 --> 01:38:36,417
- I am home.
- You're what?

1394
01:38:36,580 --> 01:38:40,255
I've given up my lease on my apartment.
I'm gonna be moving in here with you.

1395
01:38:40,620 --> 01:38:43,054
But listen, take your time.
I want you to digest this...

1396
01:38:43,220 --> 01:38:45,654
...and process things.
I could use a little sleep.

1397
01:38:45,820 --> 01:38:50,132
I'll be right out in our breakfast nook area.
I'll be curled up in our breakfast nook.

1398
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:53,258
When you're ready, you come find me
here at home, at our house.

1399
01:39:16,700 --> 01:39:21,296
This is no good. We can't go to bed when
we're arguing now that we live together.

1400
01:39:30,380 --> 01:39:32,940
And I got a big surprise planned for you.

1401
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,211
Oh, no, Freddie, not
a big surprise, please.

1402
01:39:35,780 --> 01:39:38,738
I think you're gonna change your mind
when you see this one.

1403
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:48,494
Freddie, is it all right
that we're doing this?

1404
01:39:48,660 --> 01:39:51,174
- It's a company car. It's one of the perks.
- Okay.

1405
01:39:52,140 --> 01:39:54,529
Oh, Freddie, it's unbelievable.

1406
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,930
- We're in Paris, baby.
- We're in Paris.

1407
01:40:00,820 --> 01:40:05,291
<i>So, I bet you're wondering</i>
<i>what happened to everyone else.</i>

1408
01:40:07,220 --> 01:40:11,372
<i>That Christmas turned out to be</i>
<i>one of the most successful ever.</i>

1409
01:40:13,900 --> 01:40:17,688
<i>People everywhere</i>
<i>found themselves more satisfied...</i>

1410
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:19,498
<i>... and filled up than ever.</i>

1411
01:40:19,660 --> 01:40:23,369
Good work, Hans, you've learned to use
the spreadsheet. That's wonderful work.

1412
01:40:23,540 --> 01:40:27,294
<i>So Santa hired Clyde</i>
<i>on a consulting basis.</i>

1413
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:36,170
Oh, it's a nice sweater, Clyde.
Real nice sweater.

1414
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:40,652
<i>Clyde's efficiency ensured that the</i>
<i>North Pole never fell behind again.</i>

1415
01:40:40,820 --> 01:40:44,051
<i>Even with every kid getting a present.</i>

1416
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:48,772
<i>Willie and Charlene found out</i>
<i>that kindred spirits and soul mates...</i>

1417
01:40:48,940 --> 01:40:52,137
<i>... often come in all shapes and sizes.</i>

1418
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:57,095
<i>And Bob and Linda finally got e-mail.</i>

1419
01:40:57,260 --> 01:41:01,333
Linda, where are all the new orders?

1420
01:41:01,500 --> 01:41:04,810
I e-mailed you five minutes ago!

1421
01:41:04,980 --> 01:41:08,939
Please, do not use
all caps all the time, okay?

1422
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,739
- Yeah, but...
- Not everything is that important.

1423
01:41:12,860 --> 01:41:14,054
Love you.

1424
01:41:14,540 --> 01:41:15,768
Love you back.

1425
01:41:17,420 --> 01:41:19,138
You're jumping around like animals.

1426
01:41:19,380 --> 01:41:21,814
What are you doing? Stop.
What do you got your hat on...?

1427
01:41:21,980 --> 01:41:24,130
You don't have a video.
Wear your hat like a man.

1428
01:41:24,300 --> 01:41:26,370
Turn your hat around.
Put your hat on straight.

1429
01:41:26,540 --> 01:41:28,576
You wear it like this to block the sun.

1430
01:41:28,740 --> 01:41:30,492
When you're eating, take your hats off.

1431
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:33,250
She's right. Show respect.
Take off your hat!

1432
01:41:33,420 --> 01:41:35,809
Don't forget "man"
is also in the word "manners."

1433
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:38,335
Bring it in for a team chant here. Ready?
On three!

1434
01:41:38,500 --> 01:41:40,855
One, two, three, kill them!

1435
01:41:41,180 --> 01:41:44,217
<i>Fred never stopped watching over Slam.</i>

1436
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:52,940
<i>And by the next Christmas,</i>
<i>Slam had a family of his own.</i>

1437
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:56,979
<i>Three, two, one, happy New Year!</i>

1438
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:01,492
<i>And Santa Claus finally got</i>
<i>the one present he always wanted.</i>

1439
01:42:01,660 --> 01:42:02,695
<i>He got his brother back.</i>

1440
01:42:02,860 --> 01:42:05,897
I'm not letting go. I got you in
a death grip. I'm not letting go.

1441
01:42:07,460 --> 01:42:09,451
Look! Slimming down. Citrus fruits.

1442
01:42:09,620 --> 01:42:10,735
Get out there, big guy.

1443
01:42:10,900 --> 01:42:12,299
Bit more fancy, you know.

1444
01:42:12,460 --> 01:42:14,849
Wanda, excuse me.
Mind if I take her away for a second?

1445
01:42:15,020 --> 01:42:17,739
Oh, yeah, go right ahead.

1446
01:42:17,900 --> 01:42:19,970
Come here, Dad.
It's just you and me now.

1447
01:42:20,260 --> 01:42:21,978
<i>But as I told you before...</i>

1448
01:42:22,140 --> 01:42:25,337
<i>... this is the story of a boy named Fred.</i>

1449
01:42:25,540 --> 01:42:28,612
I just love Wanda. I mean,
she's a little bit above your station.

1450
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:31,971
So I thought maybe you should just
sort of clean up your act, you know?

1451
01:42:32,140 --> 01:42:35,496
Have a great new wardrobe to start off
the new year. You're a Claus.

1452
01:42:35,700 --> 01:42:38,294
Get out there. You know,
look at your dad. He's so dapper.

1453
01:42:38,460 --> 01:42:40,496
Don't do it to me.
I'm trying to be positive.

1454
01:42:40,660 --> 01:42:45,017
Oh, but I'm positive too. I'm positive
I'm right. You need a new wardrobe.

1455
01:42:45,180 --> 01:42:46,249
Okay.

1456
01:42:46,540 --> 01:42:48,531
- Happy New Year to you, Mom.
- Happy New Year.

1457
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:51,294
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1458
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:53,532
That's more like it.

1459
01:42:53,700 --> 01:42:55,338
How about that move?
