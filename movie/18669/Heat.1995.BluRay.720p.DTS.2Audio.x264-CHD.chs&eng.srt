他们没时间，时间紧迫

可能给弄坏了，但查看一下
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

134
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,458
你认出手法吗？
You recognize the M. O?

135
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,729
手法…
M. O...

Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all, after they killed two guards...

138

杀第三名，因为横竖也是犯罪
Popped guard number three because... what difference does it make?

140
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,542
为何留下证人呢？
Why leave a living witness?

141
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,718
他们会毫不迟疑，心狠手辣
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock-and-roll.

143
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:42,421
显示劫匪的技术是精通的
The shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient.

144
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,554
足以使他们在途中下手
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

145
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,298
我们要找偷值钱东西的劫匪
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries that mystify us.

146
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,932
查“滑头”这绰号名单可能很长
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI. You're gonna get the phone book.

147
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,906
但还要查，谁卖出债券？
Do it anyway. Who's moving the bearer bonds?

148
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,871
查惯常接赃者，你和我查古和陶
Check the usual fences. You and I will check Cuzomano and Torena.

149
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,379
我要你查高士丹及艾化鲁
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

150
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,948
和鉴证科紧密合作
Hang in with Forensics.

151
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,779
向炸弹组查问用的是什么炸药
From the bomb squad, I want the eXplosive.

152
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,819
若是罕见的，可追查发售来源
If we're lucky, it's eXotic. We can trace the sale.

153
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,086
你别伸手进那人的口袋
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

154
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,692
有谁要吃批饼？
Anyone want some pie?

155
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,938
我要上厕所
Gotta go to the john.

156
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:09,580
他作势攻击我要先下手为强
I had to get it on. He was making a move. I had to get it on.

157
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,325
他那份在车上，我们的均分了…
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

158
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,693
以便全数给他…
...to make up for his full end...

159
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:34,499
因我想立即分给和打发这杂种
...'cause I want to pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.

160
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,277
等一等
Hold it!

161
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,742
其余的钱呢？
Where's the rest?

162
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,613
时候不早了，你打扮得很漂亮
We're late. You look too good to go out.

163
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,885
我想在这儿和你做爱
I'll just jump you right here.

164
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,052
钱呢？ 还给外围马的人
- Where is it? - Squared the bookies, baby.

165
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,593
几天后还会有钱，放心吧
There's more in a couple of days, so don't sweat it. We're late.

166
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,595
少胡说
Come on.

167
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,359
你定是说笑
You gotta be kidding me.

168
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,133
亲爱的…
Honey...

169
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:21,035
为区区八千元值得冒这个险吗？
...it ain't worth the risks you take for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

170
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,172
走吧
Let's go.

171
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:23,773
拿你的外衣
Get your coat.

172
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,873
无谓再说，你心智还没成熟
There is no point talking. You're a child growing older.

173
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,380
什么意思？
What does that mean?

174
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,676
我们不像成年人那样有进步…
We're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults living our lives...

175
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,982
因为我嫁给一个赌徒
...because I married a gambling junkie.

176
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,354
上车吧
Get in the fucking car.

177
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,788
我怎可以这样下去的？
What am I doing in here?

178
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,358
你不用！
You're not!

179
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,898
你离开这里时留下…
You want me to leave the bank book and the car keys...

180
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,864
银行存折和车匙
...in the kitchen on the way out the door?

181
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:52,899
你留着吧，我带多明走
- Are we going? - Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

182
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,670
你别妄想…
Don't even think about...

183
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,768
陶亚拔覆电话了
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

184
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,900
陶亚拔有给云信电话吗？

185
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,207
没有
No.

186
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,841
有报告
Report came in.

187
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:34,142
炸药是拆毁用的…
The explosive was Dy-Ex, used in demolition.

188
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:35,765
可在内华达…
You can pick it up in Nevada...

189
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,113
亚利桑拿、新墨西哥州买到
...Arizona, New MeXico.

190
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,148
太普通难以追查来源
Too common to trace a sale.

191
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,113
那太好了
That's wonderful.

192
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,297
你没事吧？
You all right?

193
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,104
怎么了？你去了哪儿？
What happened? Where have you been?

196
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:13,610
没来电话…
Didn't call...

197
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,519
没出现，我们等你直至十时半
...didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

198
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,792
这人知道他女儿是怎样的吗？
Now, does this guy have any idea what's going on with this kid?

199
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,524
我不知道
I don't know.

200
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:27,999
该死的混蛋
Fucking jerk.

201
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,964
她没事吧？
Is she okay?

202
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,131
她整天在房内
She's been in her room all day.

203
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,934
她有事，我亦不开心
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

204
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,010
我弄了晚餐…
I made dinner...

205
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,380
四小时前为我们煮了

206
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:46,174
我设法替我们保持一贯的情绪
Every time I try to maintain a consistent mood between us...

207
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,617
你退却了
...you withdraw.

208
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,952
在威尼斯大道旁边…
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

209
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,724
躺着三名死者，彩钿

对不起…
I'm sorry...

旅游使你寂寞？
Travelling makes you lonely?

284
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,762
我一个，可我并不…
I'm alone. I am not...

285
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,528
寂寞
...lonely.

286
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:34,924
你呢？
You?

287
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,934
很寂寞
Real lonely.

288
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,155
亚拔！
Albert!

289
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:47,991
糟了！
Shit!

290
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,496
你为何来这儿？你疯了吗？
What you doing here? You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

291
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,735
你该覆我电话的
You were supposed to get back to me.

292
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:56,738
你去了哪儿？
Where the fuck you been?

293
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,335
我无法脱身
I couldn't break free.

294
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,470
我们侵犯他的民权吧
Let's violate his ass right now.

295
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,137
我帮忙你…
I do for you...

296
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,815
你却不帮我，是这样吗？
...you don't do for me, is that it?

297
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,922
我整晚外出，为你刺探消息
Listen, man. I swear, I was out all night. I'm hidden like a Flamingo matador.

298
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,421
此事和我无关
That's got nothing to do with me.

299
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:18,255
我顺利为你找到线索，我很棒
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

300
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,761
你胡说
You bullshit.

301
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:22,423
我传呼你一整天，我讨厌这样做
I paged your ass all day. I hate fucking paging.

302
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,095
你又再是瘾君子？注射毒品？
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.

303
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,105
我有滥用药物的问题，心领吧？
Where's your empathy? It's a substance abuse problem.

304
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,836
我昨天对你心领你今天花我时间
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

305
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,603
你爱上了？
You fall in love?

306
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,797
你是否恋爱…
Did you fall in love...

307
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,577
和到别处去？
...and went off somewhere?

308
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,914
我会接受这解释
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

309
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,588
把消息告诉我！
Give me all you got!

310
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,519
把资料对我说！
Give me all you got!

311
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,457
我发誓我哥哥里察会跟你说
I swear, my brother Richard's going to talk to you.

312
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,288
你是说里察吗？
I heard Richard?

313
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:54,727
他会和你说的
He's going to talk to you.

314
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,129
他今晚会见你
He's gonna meet you tonight.

315
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,727
他在这儿？
He's not here, is he?

316
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,272
不，他会见你
No, he'll meet you tonight.

317
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,897
现在不行吗？
What happened to now?

318
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,871
我恳求他因我知你今早会到来
I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.

319
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,012
胡说
Bullshit.

320
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,113
我发誓，他不肯的…
I swear. He said no...

321
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,134
因他去凤凰城
...'cause he in PhoeniX.

322
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:15,116
我到了凤凰城后…
"By the time I get to PhoeniX

323
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,416
他会起程…
"He'll be rising

324
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,888
可能留下字条…
"He'll probably leave a note

325
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,818
帖在门上
"Right on the door"

326
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,055
我只能令他今晚见你
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

327
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:30,498
今晚在艾华瓦度街BJ夜总会
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

328
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,662
凌晨二时
At 2:00 a.m.

329
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:33,835
你去吧
Be there.

330
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,497
你亦要到
You be there too.

331
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,392
不行，我有事要办
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

332
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:41,444
我有事办，要到别处
I got things to do, I got places to be.

333
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:43,840
你要去
Be there.

334
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,585
你别浪费我时间
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

335
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,521
是什么买卖？
What is it?

336
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,526
是银行
It's a bank.

337
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:04,469
星期四会存钱以便分发各分行…
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...

338
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,629
应付星期五支付薪金的支票
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

339
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,936
总行夹万内星期四总放满现钞
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.

340
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:11,566
在途中下手还是劫银行？
On the prowl or strong?

341
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:12,701
由正门进入
Through the door.

342
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,109
有多少人？
How many guys?

343
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,874
连司机四人，走进银行得手便走
About four, or three, plus a driver. You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

344
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,407
你要先拿十万事成后分一成？
You want $100,000 in advance against a ten-percent cut for that?

345
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,883
听似是西部牛仔劫银行
Sounds like a cowboy score.

346
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:27,651
他们按动警钟我得在之前离去
They hit the hold-up alarms, I gotta get out before the cops show.

347
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,792
他们可按动三个遇劫警钟
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

348
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:32,894
两个一般警钟和一个蜂窝式的…
Two Telco and a cellular.

349
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,630
但讯号无法传送出去，因为…
But the signals aren't going anywhere because...

350
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,561
之前一晚…
...the night before...

351
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,136
你潜进银行…
...you cut in...

352
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,900
破坏警报系统的电脑…
...and trick out the alarm system computer...

353
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:45,407
使电脑…
...to turn itself...

354
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,570
及录影装置…
...and the video recorders off...

355
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,881
在你下手前20分钟关掉
...20 minutes before you enter.

356
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,474
你有建筑及电子蓝图？
Architectural, electrical plans?

357
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,640
我有
I got that.

358
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,721
我建造电脑板，直驳中央处理器
I got the boards already built. They go into the CPU.

359
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,557
估计可有多少钱？
What's the estimate?

360
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,655
1210万到1220万
12.1, 12.2 million.

361
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,258
我会参加
You're on.

362
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,664
恭喜
Congratulations.

363
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,637
我告诉你如何估计会有这笔钱
Let me give you a little idea of where my estimates come from.

364
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,506
没人知道货是你的
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

365
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:22,677
我让你得保险全数赔偿以六成价
My way, you get 100 percent from the insurance company...take the bonds back from us...

366
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:27,343
把债券回购你可多赚四成
...at 60 cents on the dollar and make yourself another 40 percent.

367
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,982
行动全无损失我们均可赚大钱
The operation doesn't skip a beat. We all make out.

368
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,624
我同意
Sure, you got a deal.

369
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,761
好，若大家不喜欢便没得益
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets upset.

370
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,094
要你的人给我电话，安排会面
You have your man call me and we'll set the meet.

371
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,560
好的
Yeah, okay.

372
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,836
高兴和你通电话
Nice talking to you.

373
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,568
你和他们交易？
You gonna deal with these guys?

374
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,541
江湖上可接受我偷自己的东西吗
Word's on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.

375
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,278
我会杀了这班浑蛋
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

376
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:57,974
命哈利给我加那利群岛的试算纸
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Island's Offshore.

377
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,439
这些不是估计，是实在数字
That's not really an estimate. Those are eXact figures.

378
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:08,653
我印出银行过去两月的现金帐
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow for the past two months.

379
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,592
资料怎得来的？
How'd you get this information?

380
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,027
送上门的
Just comes to you.

381
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,615
资料府拾皆是
This stuff just flies through the air.

382
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:18,129
到处传送，只需加以掌握便行
It's just beamed out all over the place. You just have to grab it.

383
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,828
我懂得掌握
I know how to grab it.

384
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,371
这是我们要的
Okay, here we go.

385
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,380
1390万
13.9 million.

386
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,485
我同意了
- I bought it. - Good.

387
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,387
我没说错吧
What did I tell you?

388
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,159
拿着
Here.

389
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,328
同意了，联络宏山和收钱吧
We're on. Call Van Zant, collect the money.

390
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,691
他怎样？
How is he?

391
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,566
他是生意人
He's a businessman.

392
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,273
基斯在我家中
Chris is at my place.

393
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,638

00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,812
夫妻的争吵
Husband and wife stuff.

395
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,109
我让他睡醒再算
I'll let him sleep it off.

396
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,964
你怎么了？
What happened to you?

397
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,262
你何时买家具？
When will you get some furniture?

398
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,033
我有时间便买
When I get around to it.

399
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,610
莎莲要离开我
Charlene's gonna leave me.

400
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:09,844
为什么？
Why?

401
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,277
我无好好供养她
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

402
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:18,381
我们做买卖还不够钱？
With everything we've been doing?

403
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,119
赌场及赌球赛使我身无分文
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

404
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,996
你何时会结婚？

405
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,791
有时间再算
When I get around to it.

406
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,294
你有外遇吗？
You got something else on the side?

407
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,202
没固定的
Nothing regular.

408
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,301
她有外遇吗？
She got something else on the side?

409
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:38,709
你肯定吗？
You sure?

410
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,345
肯定
Yeah, I'm sure.

411
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,516
我不知你做什么
I don't know what you're doing.

412
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,681
如占美说，你想当罪犯吗？
As Jimmy said, " You want to be making moves on the street?

413
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,680
要无牵挂，生活中不能有…
"Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life...

414
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:59,454
任何牵挂，风声紧时可一走了之
"...that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds if you spot the heat around the corner."

415
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,059
记得吗？
Remember that?

416
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,870
她是我一生中最重要的
For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man.

417
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,289
我们从宏山那儿拿到钱…
We take delivery of cash from Van Zant...

418
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,328
然后为劫银行的事存钱给祈素
...then I drop a deposit on Kelso for this bank.

419
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,960
什么银行？
Bank? What bank?

420
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,228
这白金的事如何？快成事了

558
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,311
你知道的？
Did you know?

559
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:16,309
你疯了
You are insane.

560
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:22,715
喜欢吗？
Do you like it?

561
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:24,795
很漂亮
- It's beautiful. - It's good.

562
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:26,897
别问他哪儿得来的
Don't ask him where he got it.

563
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:38,040
你长大后想做什么？
What do you want to be when you grow up?

564
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:39,604
我不知道
I don't know.

565
00:53:42,647 --> 00:53:43,484
像我一样
Just like me.

566
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:45,673
我亦不知道
I don't know either.

567
00:54:00,231 --> 00:54:01,323
你好
Hello?

568
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,228
是我
It's me.

569
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:07,028
我在想你是否会来电话
I was wondering if you'd call.

570
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:10,004
我很忙
I've been busy.

571
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:11,605
我可见你吗？
Can I see you?

572
00:54:12,043 --> 00:54:13,977
我害怕那只是…
I was afraid that was just...

573
00:54:14,879 --> 00:54:16,471
一夜情
...the one night.

574
00:54:17,582 --> 00:54:19,447
对我来说不是
Not for me, it wasn't.

575
00:54:21,986 --> 00:54:23,453
我也不是
Yeah, me neither.

576
00:54:25,657 --> 00:54:27,124
我可来吗？
Can I fall by?

577
00:54:28,493 --> 00:54:29,585
可以
Yeah.

578
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:31,728
一会儿见
I'll see you in a little bit.

579
00:54:44,843 --> 00:54:46,003
好的
All right.

580
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:48,540
可恶的会议
Goddamn convention.

581
00:54:49,781 --> 00:54:51,976
哪一个是滑头？ 魁悟的那个
- Which one's Slick? - The wide one.

582
00:54:52,283 --> 00:54:54,012
有两个监视器
We got two transmitters.

583
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:57,050
分别在防火板及轮内
One's in the wheel well, backup's in the firewall.

584
00:54:57,122 --> 00:54:58,111
是我们的车
Here we are.

585
00:54:58,223 --> 00:55:00,191
跟尼尔道别了吗？
Did you say good night to Neil?

586
00:55:01,025 --> 00:55:02,993
金发的是施基斯
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

587
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:06,621
特别调查姐派人跟他偷听电话
SIS has got a revolving tail and hung a wire on the house phone.

588
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:12,331
查把车三次驶过贵重金属库
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals depository three times.

589
00:55:12,404 --> 00:55:14,736
白金、银和一些金条
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

590
00:55:15,673 --> 00:55:18,335
森美和我认为是他们下一目标
Sammy and I think that's going to be their neXt score.

591
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,775
那独行者是谁？
Who's the loner?

592
00:55:22,947 --> 00:55:24,437
我们第一次见他
First time we're seeing him.

593
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:26,107
还没开始跟踪他
We're not on him yet.

594
00:55:28,253 --> 00:55:29,584
立即开始吧
Get on it.

595
00:55:47,372 --> 00:55:52,105
他们下次做案得手走出大门时…
When these guys walk out the door of whatever score they're gonna take neXt...

596
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:57,175
定会大感惊愕
...they're gonna have the surprise of a lifetime.

597
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:14,558
我要走了
Baby, time to go.

598
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,567
我令你很开心吧
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

599
00:56:22,073 --> 00:56:23,267
你很棒
You fly.

600
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:24,703
你不错
You cool.

601
00:56:32,317 --> 00:56:36,048
你骗我，我看得出别人骗我
You're lying to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.

602
00:56:36,921 --> 00:56:38,286
我没说谎
I ain't lying.

603
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,457
你很勇猛
You a hot dog.

604
00:56:41,092 --> 00:56:42,957
是出色的骑士
A regular rodeo rider.

605
00:56:43,595 --> 00:56:46,655
是我试过最精彩的性行为
And this was the monster fuck of my young life.

606
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:54,000
我现在得回到街上去
Now, I got to get my ass street-side, sugar.

607
00:56:54,038 --> 00:56:56,302
你没有老实的作风
You don't have a truth-telling style.

608
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:58,271
你说什么？
What are you talking about?

609
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:00,570
你不知道是什么回事？
You don't know what this is.

610
00:57:07,085 --> 00:57:09,553
是死神来探望你
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

611
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:29,872
你去了哪儿？
Where have you been?

612
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:33,005
塘鹅弯的特别收容所
SHU at Pelican Bay.

613
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:35,073
以及霍森监狱B座
And Folsom, B-wing.

614
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:37,706
我是一个…
I am a cowboy...

615
00:57:38,383 --> 00:57:40,283
想做大买卖的人
...looking for anything heavy.

616
00:57:40,385 --> 00:57:42,478
比利说来找你
Billy said to come see you.

617
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:45,086
因此我到来
That is why I am here.

618
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:56,782
你给这人电话吧
Why don't you call this guy?

619
00:57:57,802 --> 00:58:00,066
他经常招人入伙
This guy's always putting guys on.

620
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:05,300
谢谢
Thank you.

621
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:21,591
你们天生一对
You're perfect for each other.

622
00:58:27,398 --> 00:58:29,298
我念小学时认识一人
I knew a guy in grade school.

623
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:31,829
他叫罗尔…什么的
His name was Raoul... whatever.

624
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:35,631
他可把手指彼此屈折起来
You could take his fingers and fold them over each other.

625
00:58:35,907 --> 00:58:37,966
他可把眼睑向外翻…
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

626
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:41,068
我禁不住对你上下其手，是真的
I can't keep my hands off you. That's the truth.

627
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,242
你吸引的地方在于你那…
That's what's so wonderful about you in that...

628
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:46,977
兽性的方式
...bestial sort of way.

629
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:52,782
女人
Woman.

630
00:58:59,597 --> 00:59:01,565
这最好是轰动的大事
This better be earth-shattering.

631
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:09,838
为罗尔干杯
This is to Raoul.

632
00:59:12,176 --> 00:59:13,837
我是韩云信
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

633
00:59:56,154 --> 00:59:57,985
发现她时是这样的
Here's how we found her.

634
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,158
她有多大？
How old?

635
01:00:03,227 --> 01:00:05,889
十六七岁，在此约六小时
16, 17. Been here about siX hours.

636
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:08,565
她怎么死的？
How'd she die?

637
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:12,067
头部给重击，大脑血肿
Beat her head in, same as the others. Cerebral hematoma.

638
01:00:14,939 --> 01:00:16,099
那是谁？
Who's that?

639
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:17,972
死者母亲及兄弟
Mother and siblings.

640
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:19,046
他们为何到来？
- Why are they here? - It's fucked up.

641
01:00:19,096 --> 01:00:22,879
酒店内有人认识死者通知家人
Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.

642
01:00:24,015 --> 01:00:25,175
让我看看
Let's go.

643
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:31,013
不错
Nice.

644
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:35,882
直觉告诉我化验精液是同一人…
My intuition says the check on the semen will show it's the same guy...

645
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:39,087
是连环谋杀案，要由你着手调查
...so it's a series and ending up in your court.

646
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,022
警长有头绪吗？
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

647
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,327
还没有
Not yet.

648
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:45,168
放开我！
Get off of me!

649
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,368
天啊！
Oh, my God!

650
01:00:53,678 --> 01:00:54,481
她在哪儿？
Where is she?

651
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:56,771
冷静！
Easy, easy, easy.

652
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:01,518
别这样
Please, come on.

653
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:06,287
没事的
It's okay. It's okay.

654
01:01:06,476 --> 01:01:10,387
我的女儿呢？
Where is my baby? Where is she?

655
01:01:11,229 --> 01:01:13,424
我要知是什么回事
I need to know what happened.

656
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,733
我猜是很轰动吧
I guess the earth shattered.

657
01:01:58,543 --> 01:02:01,341
你为何不让博高送你回家？
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

658
01:02:03,247 --> 01:02:05,545
我不想扫他们的兴
I didn't want to ruin their night too.

659
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:07,314
有什么事？
What was it?

660
01:02:09,387 --> 01:02:10,877
你不想知道的
You don't want to know.

661
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:13,327
我想知道你为何扳起脸孔
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look on your face.

662
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:16,730
我不能透露，你是知道的
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

663
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,079
你从没告诉我我会摒诸事外
You never told me I'd be eXcluded.

664
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:23,437
我告诉你我们在一起时…
I told you when we hooked up...

665
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,332
你要和我分享…
...that you were gonna have to share me...

666
01:02:26,404 --> 01:02:30,170
世上所有的丑行及丑恶的人
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.

667
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:32,502
我同意接受分享…
And I bought into that sharing...

668
01:02:32,777 --> 01:02:34,404
因为我爱你
...because I love you.

669
01:02:34,846 --> 01:02:38,577
你发胖、秃头、没钱我仍爱你，开巴士
I love you fat, bald, money, no money, driving a bus.

670
01:02:38,716 --> 01:02:39,910
我不在乎
I don't care.

671
01:02:41,085 --> 01:02:42,622
但你定要存在
But you have got to be present like a normal guy.

672
01:02:42,672 --> 01:02:47,006
那是分享，这不是分享是残余的
That's sharing. This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

673
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:49,719
我该回家和我该说：
What I should do is come home and say:

674
01:02:50,595 --> 01:02:54,087
你知道吗？我今天走进一房子…
"Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...

675
01:02:54,198 --> 01:02:58,259
这瘾君子用微波炉煮熟了孩子…
"...where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...

676
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:01,827
因他哭的太吵闹，我和你分享吧
"...because he was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.

677
01:03:01,906 --> 01:03:04,739
让我们分享此事，而在分享时…
"Come on, let's share that and in sharing it...

678
01:03:04,942 --> 01:03:09,436
我们会宣泄一切可怕的事件
"...we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit."

679
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:11,046
对吗？
Right?

680
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:14,585
错
Wrong.

681
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:16,113
你知道是何解？
You know why?

682
01:03:16,187 --> 01:03:18,325
你喜欢正常的做法
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

683
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,790
我们做爱，你不说话
We fuck and you don't speak.

684
01:03:20,858 --> 01:03:23,019
我得保持我的痛苦
'Cause I got to hold onto my angst.

685
01:03:23,628 --> 01:03:25,061
我保存它…
I preserve it...

686
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:28,596
因为我需要藉此提高警觉
...because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

687
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:30,397
我要这样做
Where I gotta be.

688
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:39,471
你不是和我同住
You don't live with me.

689
01:03:42,046 --> 01:03:44,708
你和死者的残骸同住
You live among the remains of dead people.

690
01:03:48,653 --> 01:03:50,848
你筛选碎片 在地势找线索
You sift through the detritus.You read the terrain.

691
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:54,060
你找寻死亡的迹象…
You search for signs of passing...

692
01:03:54,729 --> 01:03:56,788
找猎物的气味…
...for the scent of your prey...

693
01:03:56,864 --> 01:03:58,832
然后追捕他们
...and then you hunt them down.

694
01:04:00,468 --> 01:04:03,164
这是你唯一投入的事
That's the only thing you're committed to.

695
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:09,475
其余的是你留下的烂摊子
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.

696
01:04:14,749 --> 01:04:18,185
我不明白为何不能离开你
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.

697
01:04:37,939 --> 01:04:39,429
走吧
Let's go, baby.

698
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:43,938
我见过经理
I met the manager.

699
01:04:44,345 --> 01:04:45,812
那是老板吗？
Is that the boss?

700
01:04:46,948 --> 01:04:49,167
我为他每天所做的事而坐牢
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.

701
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:53,779
你可忍受直至找到新工作吗？
Can you just handle it till we find you something new?

702
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:56,381
你可以吗？
Can you do that?

703
01:04:58,459 --> 01:05:01,428
更难忍受的我亦捱过
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.

704
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:09,435
你为何和我一起
What you're hanging with me for?

705
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:13,139
因为你令我感骄傲
Because I'm proud of you.

706
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:20,514
你以我为荣？
You're proud of me?

707
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:27,579
为什么？
Why the hell are you proud of me?

708
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:30,556
回家吧
Come on home.

709
01:05:41,402 --> 01:05:43,131
你在做什么？
What were you doing there?

710
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:44,805
我滑雪
I was skiing.

711
01:05:45,006 --> 01:05:46,769
我想滑雪
I was trying to ski.

712
01:05:47,575 --> 01:05:49,761
那儿的人会这样做，去滑雪…
That's what people do there. You go skiing...

713
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:53,177
可结识别人
...and you meet people.

714
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:55,106
你想开心一下
You try to have a good time.

715
01:05:55,183 --> 01:05:56,844
你开心吗？
- Did you have a good time? - No.

716
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:58,078
为什么？
Why not?

717
01:05:58,419 --> 01:06:00,387
我不擅交际
I'm not good at meeting people.

718
01:06:00,855 --> 01:06:02,220
你认识了我
You met me.

719
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:05,458
我没加细想事情便发生了
That happened without my thinking about it.

720
01:06:05,927 --> 01:06:07,861
可能是因为这样…
Which is why I probably...

721
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:10,555
不，是因为你是好的女子
No, it's because you are fine.

722
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:17,861
和我到外地去
Take off with me for a while.

723
01:06:19,273 --> 01:06:20,205
去哪？
Where?

724
01:06:20,808 --> 01:06:22,207
新西兰
New Zealand.

725
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:24,603
何时？
When?

726
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,874
我不能和你去，你可会合我
I have to go separate. You can meet me there.

727
01:06:29,384 --> 01:06:30,851
但我的工作
But my job...

728
01:06:30,952 --> 01:06:33,113
我有钱，你不用工作
I got money. You don't need money.

729
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:35,689
你可在那儿开设计公司
You could set up a studio and work there.

730
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:37,318
我不知道
I don't know.

731
01:06:37,392 --> 01:06:38,916
还要知道什么？
What's there to know?

732
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,527
你结了婚没有？
Are you married?

733
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,222
什么？
What?

734
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:45,457
我才没有结婚
The last thing I am is married.

735
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:47,985
我的生活正在走下坡
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way.

736
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:50,431
可是，突然…
Then, all of a sudden...

737
01:06:51,339 --> 01:06:53,398
出现了你这样的人
...someone like you comes along.

738
01:06:57,078 --> 01:06:58,045
你不了解我
You don't know me.

739
01:06:58,112 --> 01:06:59,579
我已了解
I know enough.

740
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:04,983
跟我走
Come with me.

741
01:07:14,862 --> 01:07:16,329
有何不妥？
What's wrong?

742
01:07:18,099 --> 01:07:20,932
没什么，一切妥当，你会去吗？
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?

743
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:26,931
会
Yeah.

744
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:31,645
好
Good.

745
01:07:56,637 --> 01:07:58,036
亲爱的
Hi, sweetie.

746
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:01,875
你忘记妈妈会接你吗？
You forget your mom was picking you up?

747
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:04,567
不是
No.

748
01:08:06,714 --> 01:08:08,477
怎么回事？
So, what's going on?

749
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:12,047
我想独自一人
I felt like being alone.

750
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:16,889
我送你回家
Come on, I'll drive you home.

751
01:09:13,648 --> 01:09:14,842
有何动静？
What's happening?

752
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:17,748
长官
Sir.

753
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:20,480
警长想知道有何动静
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

754
01:09:21,022 --> 01:09:23,456
没动静，不要用无线电
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

755
01:10:17,778 --> 01:10:19,040
好技术
Technique.

756
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:40,557
芝麻开门
Open Sesame. Right there.

757
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:39,758
就是他
There he is.

758
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,218
我们走吧
We walk!

759
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,120
我快完事了
I'm there.

760
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:45,158
走吧
We walk!

761
01:13:00,508 --> 01:13:01,839
他听到了
He's heard it.

762
01:13:10,251 --> 01:13:13,137
他们来了
Heads up.

763
01:13:13,187 --> 01:13:15,314
等一等
- One's coming out. - Hold it, Captain.

764
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:17,653
他没带走任何东西
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

765
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:18,925
我看见
I see.

766
01:13:22,163 --> 01:13:22,813
行动
- Here we go. - Not till my boss says so.

767
01:13:22,863 --> 01:13:27,323
由我上司批准，他们没拿东西
Both of them are not carrying anything.

768
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,194
让他们走
- Let them go. - What do you mean?

769
01:13:37,244 --> 01:13:38,429
我们可拘捕他们
We can take them on!

770
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:40,208
控以何罪？
On what?

771
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:42,212
他们没偷东西
They didn't steal anything.

772
01:13:42,516 --> 01:13:46,976
行为不检他们坐牢半年便出狱
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor, they do siX months and they're out.

773
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:48,447
不行
No fucking way.

774
01:13:48,522 --> 01:13:51,787
我不会接受批评，他们不能走
I'm not taking the heat from my boss. They are not walking.

775
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:55,454
他们会走，今次行动由我指挥
That's eXactly what they'll do. They'll walk. This is my operation.

776
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:58,327
我的战略指挥凌驾你的职级
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.

777
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:01,562
他们会离去，你会让他们走
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck!

778
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:48,915
继续工作
Back to work.

779
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:54,480
罗省警方？密探？警方从何来？
LAPD, the G, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?

780
01:14:55,089 --> 01:14:58,058
他们或知那儿被劫不知是我们
Maybe it's the score they were onto. The place, not us.

781
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:00,626
因为那儿以前曾遇劫
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

782
01:15:00,828 --> 01:15:04,992
假设他们知道我们的电话住所
Assume they got our phones, our houses. Assume they got us right here, right now...

783
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:07,533
假设一切
...as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

784
01:15:08,035 --> 01:15:10,128
我们如何付劫银行的上期？
How are we gonna buy the bank package?

785
01:15:10,204 --> 01:15:11,728
我先垫付吧
I'll front that.

786
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:13,568
宏山呢？
What if Van Zant has 750?

787
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:17,642
警方追查我们你想和他开战吗？
With the heat we got, you want to play World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

788
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:19,372
不，我想拿75万
No, I want my 750.

789
01:15:19,947 --> 01:15:24,213
我比你更想杀了宏山
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luXury.

790
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:26,947
问题是我们劫银行还是离去
Our problem is to take the bank, or split right now.

791
01:15:27,054 --> 01:15:29,249
不要回家收拾东西
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

792
01:15:29,623 --> 01:15:34,083
30秒后我们会各走各路
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways. That's it.

793
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,167
值得冒险劫银行
The bank is worth the risk.

794
01:15:41,435 --> 01:15:42,902
我需要钱
I need it, brother.

795
01:15:44,571 --> 01:15:47,768
我认为我们该留下来劫银行
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.

796
01:15:58,786 --> 01:16:00,879
你做什么我亦跟随
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

797
01:16:01,422 --> 01:16:03,173
但今次不行
- Whatever. - Not on this one.

798
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:05,191
你要自行决定
On this one, you're on your own.

799
01:16:18,172 --> 01:16:20,572
这是最好的做法吗？
You figure this is the best thing to do?

800
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,793
是最好的做法吗？
This is the best thing to do?

801
01:16:22,843 --> 01:16:26,897
事后我有打算值得为这笔钱坐牢
I've got plans, I'm going away after, so the reward is worth the stretch.

802
01:16:26,947 --> 01:16:30,007
但绮玲很照顾你，你有许多钱
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.

803
01:16:30,084 --> 01:16:32,279
你有物业，若我是你…
You got T-bonds, real estate.

804
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:35,219
便不参与今次行动
If I were you, I would be smart and cut loose of this.

805
01:16:53,474 --> 01:16:54,736
对我来说…
For me...

806
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:57,035
行动使生活更刺激
...the action is the juice.

807
01:16:57,678 --> 01:16:58,645
我参加
I'm in.

808
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:05,983
我会
Yeah, sure.

809
01:17:06,153 --> 01:17:07,245
动手吧
Let's go.

810
01:17:08,055 --> 01:17:09,886
去他们的，行动吧
Fuck them, let's do it.

811
01:17:10,057 --> 01:17:12,355
我们有许多事要做
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

812
01:17:25,672 --> 01:17:27,003
可以的话我会的


813
01:17:29,676 --> 01:17:31,507
添，我给你电话吧
Tim, I gotta call you back.

814
01:17:31,845 --> 01:17:34,211
你是马亚伦吗？
- Can I help you? - Are you Alan Marciano?

815
01:17:34,415 --> 01:17:35,746
你是谁？
Who the fuck are you?

816
01:17:35,816 --> 01:17:36,976
我是谁？
Who am I?

817
01:17:37,718 --> 01:17:39,948
罗省警局的韩云信探长
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

818
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,456
这儿是赌场不是你权力范围
LA? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.

819
01:17:44,892 --> 01:17:48,453
你知在惹恼谁吗？我认识人
Do you know who the fuck you're pushing around? I know people here.

820
01:17:48,662 --> 01:17:51,130
我可要赌城警方拘押你
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

821
01:17:53,133 --> 01:17:57,297
你会因从北卡罗来纳走私香烟…
You are eXtradited to Newark on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

822
01:17:57,337 --> 01:17:59,567
而给引渡回纽华克…
...up from North Carolina three years ago...

823
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,608
或是你可和我们合作
...or you go to work for us.

824
01:18:02,009 --> 01:18:03,476
简单明快
Cut and dried.

825
01:18:03,944 --> 01:18:05,309
就是这样
That is it.

826
01:18:05,612 --> 01:18:06,704
操
Shit.

827
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:09,410
施莎莲
Charlene Shiherlis.

828
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:10,747
谁？
Who?

829
01:18:10,918 --> 01:18:11,782
谁？
Who?

830
01:18:12,186 --> 01:18:14,104
你是猫头鹰吗？
What are you, a fucking owl?

831
01:18:14,154 --> 01:18:18,090
和你在电话中淫声浪语的女子
The lady you been talking dirty to on the telephone every day last week.

832
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:20,153
你不能把她和我扯上了
You can't tie me to her.

833
01:18:20,494 --> 01:18:24,521
你肯定会回去新泽西的，笨蛋
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jackoff.

834
01:18:25,699 --> 01:18:28,552
我为何会勾搭上她？
Why did I get miXed up with her?

835
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:31,070
因为她的屁股动人
Because she got a great ass!

836
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,570
你不知自己在做什么
And you got your head all the way up it.

837
01:18:36,677 --> 01:18:37,644
天啊
Jesus.

838
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:39,745
我很凶，是吗？
Ferocious, aren't I?

839
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,011
当我想起屁股…
When I think of asses...

840
01:18:42,082 --> 01:18:43,549
女人的屁股…
...a woman's ass...

841
01:18:44,118 --> 01:18:46,018
便想起一些东西
...something comes out of me.

842
01:18:47,521 --> 01:18:48,180
那么？
So?

843
01:18:48,255 --> 01:18:49,620
不要你说太多
So, no big thing.

844
01:18:50,591 --> 01:18:52,058
我只想…
All I want...

845
01:18:52,392 --> 01:18:55,054
知她丈夫和他那伙人
...is her husband and his whole fucking crew.

846

你会和泽加合作

847
01:19:02,035 --> 01:19:04,367
圣金文路和赫摩撒街
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

848
01:19:04,771 --> 01:19:07,740
我们在那儿穿过栏栅
...that's where we cut through the fence. That's the access.

849
01:19:07,808 --> 01:19:08,775
对
Right.

850
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:11,567
保安系统不堪一击
The security systems around here are a joke.

851
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:19,283
逃走路线一是圣云逊汤玛士桥
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge, that's escape route number one.

852
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,187
路线二…
Number two:

853
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:23,289
是安纳咸公路往110公路
Over here. Anaheim to the 110.

854
01:19:23,857 --> 01:19:24,575
好
Good.

855
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:26,123
明白吗？
You got it?

856
01:19:26,193 --> 01:19:27,592
好的，走吧
Good. Let's go.

857
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,842
他们回头望向…
They were looking back...

858
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:54,845
这方向
...in this direction.

859
01:19:55,622 --> 01:19:57,419
货柜设施？
A container facility?

860
01:19:57,491 --> 01:19:59,015
什么？
What? Cartage theft?

861
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:02,027
太明显了 对他们来说得益太少了
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

862
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:08,297
有炼油厂、废车场
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

863
01:20:08,335 --> 01:20:09,700
炼油厂发薪用支票
Refinery pays by check.

864
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:11,067
没有现金
No cash around.

865
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:12,929
废车场亦一样
Same for the scrap yard.

866
01:20:16,443 --> 01:20:17,774
偷车轮盖？
Stealing hubcaps?

867
01:20:21,915 --> 01:20:24,042
炼油厂和废车场？
A refinery and a scrap yard.

868
01:20:25,485 --> 01:20:27,112
是什么回事？
What the hell is going on?

869
01:20:27,187 --> 01:20:29,280
我们正想知道
That's what we are trying to figure out.

870
01:20:30,123 --> 01:20:31,920
我们以为已知道了
We thought we had it.

871
01:20:32,659 --> 01:20:34,024
我们以为已知道了
Thought we had it.

872
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,262
我知道…
I got an idea...

873
01:20:46,206 --> 01:20:48,140
他们在看些什么
...on what they're looking at.

874
01:20:51,812 --> 01:20:54,076
你们要知吗？
Want to know what they're looking at?

875
01:20:55,882 --> 01:20:58,783
这人真了不起，他真行
I mean, is this guy something, or is he something?

876
01:21:00,287 --> 01:21:01,948
这伙人很棒
This crew is good.

877
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:05,785
你们想知吗？
You want to know?

878
01:21:07,027 --> 01:21:08,119
是什么？
What?

879
01:21:09,496 --> 01:21:10,485

883
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:27,939

Yeah!

884
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,582

好吧，杂种
Okay, motherfucker!

887
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:13,959
交出了，蓝图很详尽

891
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:27,396
韩监视你一举一动

893
01:22:31,078 --> 01:22:33,512
没监视你，不知你晚上在哪儿
Not yours. They've been losing you at night.

894
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:34,877
他很积极
He's a hot dog.

895
01:22:35,115 --> 01:22:37,413
他毕业后加以陆战队

898
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:45,251
法兰是个狂人
He was a fucking maniac.

899
01:22:46,126 --> 01:22:48,390
他之前在毒品科工作

900
01:22:48,862 --> 01:22:51,228
离婚两次，目前的太太叫彩钿
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

901
01:22:51,298 --> 01:22:52,959
是他鼓动严密监视的
He's why the eXtra heat.

902
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:57,430
罪案科警官…
The vice sergeant...

903
01:22:58,772 --> 01:23:00,706
说韩喜欢你…
...says Hanna likes you...

01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:04,227
认为你是明星，行事很有技巧

他能想到这样看他有多聪明
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

906

他像心脏病般好笑
Funny as a heart attack.

907
01:23:11,718 --> 01:23:15,245
三次结婚？你认为他喜欢在家？
Three marriages? Do you think that means he likes staying home?

908
01:23:15,956 --> 01:23:18,424
他是那种…
Means he's one of those guys out there...

909
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:21,355
整晚工作的人，很投入
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

910
01:23:23,697 --> 01:23:26,131
有他和警方监视取消劫银行吧
With him and this much heat, you should pass.

911
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,067
值得冒险一试

这人可抓到我或是失手

931
01:26:09,129 --> 01:26:11,723
前有两辆车，三辆在他后面

要其中一辆在维蒙街接我

01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:17,498
走吧
Let's go.

934
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:11,216
我离他百码吗？太近还是太远？
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I close or far, or what?

935
01:27:11,691 --> 01:27:13,750
离他300码，在中央行车线
Three hundred yards, center lane.

936
01:28:20,894 --> 01:28:22,225
你好吗？
How're you doing?

937
01:28:25,899 --> 01:28:28,561
我请你喝咖啡如何？
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

938
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:36,372
好的，走吧

943
01:29:03,536 --> 01:29:05,504
那儿是一如所说的那么凶残吗？
McNeil as tough as they say?

944
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,708
你是监狱学者吗？

945
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:11,604
你想再坐牢？

946
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:15,906
我追捕想犯错被捕的人拘捕他们
I chased down some crews. Guys just looking to fuck up, get busted back.

947
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:17,174

我拘捕各式各样的人
I worked all kinds.

950
01:29:26,493 --> 01:29:30,429
你幻想我身上有刺青行劫酒铺吗
You see me doing liquor store holdup with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

951
01:29:31,698 --> 01:29:32,665
我不是
I do not.

952
01:29:33,266 --> 01:29:34,233
对
Right.

953

我不会再坐牢
I am never going back.

954
01:29:39,339 --> 01:29:41,466
那么便别再行劫
Then don't take down scores.

955
01:29:42,742 --> 01:29:44,403
我做擅长做的事
I do what I do best.

956
01:29:44,577 --> 01:29:48,513
我行劫，你做擅长的事，阻止我
I take scores. You do what you do best: Try to stop guys like me.

957
01:29:52,385 --> 01:29:54,649
你从不想过正常生活？
You never wanted a regular type life?

958
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:58,117
是怎样的？烧烤和打足球吗？
What is that? The barbecues and the ball games?

959
01:30:00,193 --> 01:30:01,125
是的
Yeah.

960
01:30:03,596 --> 01:30:05,655
你的生活正常吗？
This regular type like your life?

961
01:30:06,366 --> 01:30:08,334
我的生活？不，我的生活…
My life? No, my life...

962
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:11,798
一塌糊涂
My life's a disaster zone.

963
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,165
我的继女情绪深受困扰
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

964
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:19,803
因她的生父是个大浑蛋
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.

965
01:30:19,879 --> 01:30:21,176
我有太太…
I got a wife.

966
01:30:21,247 --> 01:30:25,045
我三次婚姻正频临破碎边缘
We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage.My third.

967
01:30:27,287 --> 01:30:31,053
因我常花时间追捕你这样的人
Because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.

968
01:30:31,124 --> 01:30:32,455
那是我的生活
That's my life.

969
01:30:38,965 --> 01:30:40,728
有人曾对我说…
Guy told me one time:

970
01:30:42,535 --> 01:30:45,889
若你感到附近有警方监视
"Don't get attached to anything you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

971
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:49,508
便不能沾上任何不能脱身的事
"...if you feel the heat around the corner."

972
01:30:50,977 --> 01:30:54,174
你想捉我，我行动时你亦行动…
If you're on me and you got to move when I move...

973
01:30:54,547 --> 01:30:57,277
你如何能保持婚姻呢？
...how do you eXpect to keep a marriage?

974
01:30:59,419 --> 01:31:01,250
这说法很有趣
That's an interesting point.

975
01:31:02,789 --> 01:31:04,017
你是僧侣吗？
What are you, a monk?

976
01:31:05,391 --> 01:31:06,653
我有女伴
I have a woman.

977
01:31:07,193 --> 01:31:08,660
你怎对她说？
What do you tell her?

978
01:31:11,097 --> 01:31:12,826
我是推销员
I tell her I'm a salesman.

979
01:31:19,606 --> 01:31:22,666
那么若你见我从街角走来…
So, if you spot me coming around that corner...

980
01:31:23,676 --> 01:31:25,576
你会离开她？
...you'll just walk out on her?

981
01:31:27,113 --> 01:31:28,740
不辞而别？
Not say good-bye?

982
01:31:29,515 --> 01:31:31,176
那是自律
That's the discipline.

983
01:31:32,018 --> 01:31:33,815
那很空泛
That's pretty vacant.

984
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,647
正是如此
It is what it is.

985
01:31:35,788 --> 01:31:38,586
不这样做我们还是另找职业吧
It's that, or we both better go do something else.

986
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,528
我不懂做别的
I don't know how to do anything else.

987
01:31:43,029 --> 01:31:44,462
我也不懂
Neither do I.

988
01:31:47,267 --> 01:31:48,825
我不想
I don't want to either.

989
01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:50,796
我也不想
Neither do I.

990
01:31:58,511 --> 01:32:01,105
我不断重复这梦境
You know, I have this recurring dream.

991
01:32:02,982 --> 01:32:05,951
我坐在偌大的餐宴席上…
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

992
01:32:06,019 --> 01:32:09,648
我调查的凶案受害人均出席…
...all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting there...

993
01:32:09,722 --> 01:32:13,317
他们用黑的眼珠子瞪望我…
...and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...

994
01:32:14,294 --> 01:32:18,230
因为他们头部中枪而出血
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.

995
01:32:19,499 --> 01:32:22,559
这些发胀的尸体在那儿…
And there they are, these big balloon people...

996
01:32:23,269 --> 01:32:26,466
因他们被杀两周后才在床下发现
...because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.

997
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,708
邻居报称有恶臭…
The neighbors reported the smell...

998
01:32:30,109 --> 01:32:32,338
他们均有出席…
...and there they are...

999
01:32:32,412 --> 01:32:34,141
坐在那儿
...all just sitting there.

1000
01:32:36,349 --> 01:32:37,543
他们说什么？
What do they say?

1001
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:40,552
没说话
Nothing.

1002
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,248
没人说话？
No talk?

1003
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:46,187
他们无话可说
They have nothing to say.

1004
01:32:47,093 --> 01:32:49,061
我们彼此望着对方
We just look at each other.

1005
01:32:50,029 --> 01:32:51,690
他们望着我…
They look at me...

1006
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:54,359
就是这样，梦境是这样
...and that's it. That's the dream.

1007
01:32:57,203 --> 01:32:59,103
我做梦自己遇溺
I have one where I'm drowning.

1008
01:32:59,839 --> 01:33:03,502
我得弄醒自己和呼吸否则会死
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing or I'll die in my sleep.

1009
01:33:05,611 --> 01:33:06,976
这象征什么？
What's that about?

1010
01:33:07,547 --> 01:33:10,047
有足够的时间
Having enough time.

1011
01:33:11,718 --> 01:33:12,946
足够时间…
Enough time...

1012
01:33:13,353 --> 01:33:15,116
做你想做的事？
...to do what you want to do?

1013
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:16,550
是的
That's right.

1014
01:33:19,058 --> 01:33:20,457
你现在这样做？
You doing it now?

1015
01:33:20,593 --> 01:33:21,855
还没有
No, not yet.

1016
01:33:27,467 --> 01:33:29,435
我们坐在这里…
You know, we're sitting here...

1017
01:33:30,803 --> 01:33:33,033
一如常人，
...like a couple of regular fellas.

1018
01:33:33,206 --> 01:33:35,674
彼此做有需要的事
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

1019
01:33:38,077 --> 01:33:40,477
现在我们见过面…
Now that we've been face to face...

1020
01:33:43,416 --> 01:33:46,078
若我要在案发现场杀你…
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

1021
01:33:46,419 --> 01:33:47,886
我会不喜欢
...I won't like it.

1022
01:33:48,755 --> 01:33:49,915
但是…
But, I tell you...

1023
01:33:52,492 --> 01:33:54,460
若在你和…
...if it's between you...

1024
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:58,494
给你杀死的人当中作选择…
...and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

1025
01:33:59,432 --> 01:34:00,660
兄弟…
...brother...

1026
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,965
没命的会是你
...you are going down.

1027
01:34:15,515 --> 01:34:17,847
我有反面的看法
There's a flip side to that coin.

1028
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:22,349
若你真的使我走投无路…
What if you do got me boXed in...

1029
01:34:22,755 --> 01:34:24,552
而我要杀你呢？
...and I gotta put you down?

1030
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:27,420
因为不管如何…
Because no matter what...

1031
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,928
你亦不能阻止我的
...you won't get in my way.

1032
01:34:31,197 --> 01:34:33,427
是的，我们见过面
We've been face to face, yeah.

1033
01:34:36,736 --> 01:34:38,465
但我会毫不犹疑杀你
But I will not hesitate.

1034
01:34:38,805 --> 01:34:40,204
一秒也不迟疑
Not for a second.

1035
01:34:46,612 --> 01:34:48,079
也许会这样
Maybe that'll happen.

1036
01:34:50,817 --> 01:34:51,875
或是…
Or...

1037
01:34:52,218 --> 01:34:53,549
谁晓得呢？
...who knows?

1038
01:34:54,153 --> 01:34:56,519
也许我们会永远不再见
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1039
01:35:12,338 --> 01:35:13,862
他们摆脱了我们
They dumped us.

1040
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:16,005
什么？
What?

1041
01:35:16,642 --> 01:35:18,109
他们逃脱了
They dumped us.

1042
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:19,973
什么意思？
What do you mean?

1043
01:35:20,046 --> 01:35:21,206
基斯狡脱了
Chris slipped away.

1044
01:35:21,347 --> 01:35:23,338
他没谈及买卖的事
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1045
01:35:23,416 --> 01:35:26,817
我无从向马套取资料
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I just tried.

1046
01:35:27,153 --> 01:35:29,144
查米高呢？ 亦一样
- What about Cheritto? - Same.

1047
01:35:29,255 --> 01:35:31,917
异频收发器放在公共汽车上
Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

1048
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,425
他们摆脱我们所有的监视？
They dumped all our surveillance?

1049
01:35:36,496 --> 01:35:38,726
是的，同一时间，间上九时
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1050
01:35:39,966 --> 01:35:43,197
我半小时前和麦尼尔喝咖啡
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

1051
01:35:43,402 --> 01:35:48,369
之后他驶往机场我们无法飞去 We were on you.彼此做有需要的事


1052
01:35:49,075 --> 01:35:51,509
他的车上仍在，不见了他
His car's still there. He's gone.

1053
01:35:56,916 --> 01:36:01,444
有谁知道他们在哪儿？
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

1054
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,247
他有联络吗？
Hear from him?

1055
01:37:03,249 --> 01:37:07,242
没有，这令我不安，他在哪儿？
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more. Where's this guy?

1056
01:37:09,889 --> 01:37:10,787
这人…
This guy...

1057
01:37:10,856 --> 01:37:12,289
我们雇用他
...we put him on.

1058
01:37:12,458 --> 01:37:14,119
他说认识麦尼尔
Says he knows McCauley.

1059
01:37:19,832 --> 01:37:20,764
你是谁？
Who are you?

1060
01:37:22,034 --> 01:37:23,262
荣谷
Waingro.

1061
01:37:23,803 --> 01:37:25,464
我叫荣谷
My name's Waingro.

1062
01:37:25,805 --> 01:37:29,002
我等他电话，你很熟识他吗？
I've been living in this office. How well do you know him?

1063
01:37:30,376 --> 01:37:32,867
我们一起做过不少大买卖
We took some major scores together.

1064
01:37:36,816 --> 01:37:38,716
他为何没找我？
Why haven't I heard from him?

1065
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:40,985
他可能忙着
He's probably busy right now.

1066
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,981
但他行事很彻底
But he's real thorough.

1067
01:37:44,323 --> 01:37:46,484
他不会忘记你的
He ain't going to forget about you.

1068
01:37:46,792 --> 01:37:48,191
那令人很安心
That's reassuring.

1069
01:37:49,996 --> 01:37:52,487
我可在这儿出了力
I got some moves I could make here.

1070
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:55,896
可能对你会很有帮助
Probably be a big help to you.

1071
01:38:17,356 --> 01:38:19,017
认得那烤肉的人吗？
You recognize the grill man?

1072
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:27,692
不认识
No.

1073
01:38:27,767 --> 01:38:28,597

1075

我还没有小休

1076

薜哥和彭曹没上班

1077

扔垃圾，到餐厅后抹地
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1078

稍后才休息吧
Take your break later.

1079
01:38:41,981 --> 01:38:43,448
人渣
Piece of shit.

1080
01:38:43,683 --> 01:38:44,843
送出去吧
Pick up!

1081
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,644
他在哪儿？
Where the hell is he?

1082
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:52,257
我查看车场看车是否仍在那儿
I want to check the slot for the work car.

1083
01:38:52,325 --> 01:38:53,292
我也想
So did I.

1084
01:38:58,497 --> 01:39:02,200
等一等

你在哪儿？
Where are you?

1087
01:39:23,089 --> 01:39:26,353
到处有警察监视我
There's cops all over me, man, like a cheap suit.

1088
01:39:26,826 --> 01:39:28,225
我无法摆脱他们
I can't dump them.

1089
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:32,491
他们知道你看见他们
They know you see them?

1090
01:39:32,932 --> 01:39:34,832
他们平衡紧帖我
They're doing parallels.

1091
01:39:37,536 --> 01:39:39,094
我可试行摆脱他们
I can try to dump them again.

1092
01:39:39,171 --> 01:39:41,366
我怎知道你是否摆脱了？
How are we going to know if you did?

1093
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,101
你会引他们来找我们
You'll draw them to us.

1094

到宏杜拿去

1097

1098
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,472
你好吗？
What's up?

1099
01:40:22,548 --> 01:40:24,311
你在这儿做什么？

记得
Yeah, sure.

1104
01:40:32,691 --> 01:40:33,851
你可信任吗？
You cool?

1105
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,221
你知我可信任
You know I'm cool.

1106
01:40:36,996 --> 01:40:39,430
你现在便答我，肯或不肯

是什么烧焦了？
What's burning?

1110
01:41:11,697 --> 01:41:12,925
是什么事？
What is this?

1111
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:15,724
你去哪里？
Where do you think you're going?

1112
01:42:51,263 --> 01:42:53,923
别动！举手！
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

1113
01:42:54,066 --> 01:42:55,124
举手！

02:00:32,665 --> 02:00:35,190
今天之后你还相信逃走计划吗？
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1263
02:00:36,469 --> 02:00:38,960
这告密的人，哪儿找到他的？
This rat motherfucker, where did we get him?

1264
02:00:39,038 --> 02:00:42,599
他是机密线人通报劫银行线索
He's a C.I. For a burglary cop. Called in the tip on the bank.

1265
02:00:42,775 --> 02:00:44,402
谈麦尼尔吧
On Neil McCauley.

1266
02:00:44,577 --> 02:00:46,044
还有多少时间？
How much time we got?

1267
02:00:46,512 --> 02:00:51,176
他有8至10小时安排新逃走路线
Eight, ten hours for him to set up a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1268
02:01:44,837 --> 02:01:47,635
你向我们告发麦！你怎知道？
You ratted McCauley to us! How'd you know?

1269
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,171
谁告诉你的？
Who told you?

1270
02:01:49,542 --> 02:01:51,840
是谁告诉你的？
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1271
02:01:52,211 --> 02:01:53,269
是谁？
Who?

1272
02:02:37,924 --> 02:02:39,414
荣谷在哪儿？
Waingro, where is he?

1273
02:02:40,626 --> 02:02:41,490
在哪儿？
Where?

1274
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:42,925
我怎知道？
How would I know?

1275
02:03:08,721 --> 02:03:11,779
这儿有些什么？
Well......what do we have here?

1276
02:03:13,025 --> 02:03:14,253
这儿漂亮吗？
This pretty?

1277
02:03:14,327 --> 02:03:15,453
漂亮吗？
This pretty?

1278
02:03:17,622 --> 02:03:20,283
你这小人
You piece of shit.

1279
02:03:20,333 --> 02:03:23,461
你告诉我想脱离目前困境
Told me you wanted out from under. You're scared, right?

1280
02:03:23,736 --> 02:03:25,567
你想脱身吗？这是出路
You want out? This is out.

1281
02:03:25,638 --> 02:03:26,614
你有何得益？
- Yeah, what's your end?

1282
02:03:26,664 --> 02:03:28,325
我不需要笨女人
- I don't need no stupid broad.

1283
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,875
我怎会牵涉此事的？
How'd I get into this?

1284
02:03:30,977 --> 02:03:31,875
别冲动
Easy.

1285
02:03:32,745 --> 02:03:35,145
你听到的，她生活坎坷
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1286
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:38,641
给她喝杯酒，到橱柜看看
FiX her a drink.Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1287
02:03:38,684 --> 02:03:39,742
去她的
Fuck her.

1288
02:03:42,154 --> 02:03:44,816
你最好进去和不要出来
You better get in there and stay in there.

1289
02:03:47,819 --> 02:03:49,760
听着
Lookie here.

1290
02:03:51,263 --> 02:03:53,527
我是泽加，
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

1291
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:55,624
要送多明进睡房吗？
You want to put Dominick in the bedroom?

1292
02:03:55,835 --> 02:03:57,268
他和我一起
He stays with me.

1293
02:04:07,913 --> 02:04:09,312
现在怎办？
So, what now?

1294
02:04:12,118 --> 02:04:13,244
他说的对
He's right.

1295
02:04:13,319 --> 02:04:15,378
你想脱身？这是出路
You want out? This is out.

1296
02:04:17,223 --> 02:04:19,487
你认为你要出卖基斯？
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1297
02:04:19,558 --> 02:04:20,786
正是
No shit.

1298
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,760
对，你要会这样做
That's right. You would have to.

1299
02:04:24,363 --> 02:04:27,799
若不出卖基斯多明会是受害人
See, if you don't betray Chris, you victimize Dominick.

1300
02:04:29,168 --> 02:04:31,546
你入狱时他会是孤儿
'Cause he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...

1301
02:04:31,596 --> 02:04:37,539
你没父母照顾他他会送收养所…
...'cause you got no parents to take him. So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1302
02:04:37,610 --> 02:04:39,510
青少年中心
...juvenile facilities.

1303
02:04:39,745 --> 02:04:41,508
之后他会偷车
Then he steals a car.

1304
02:04:42,214 --> 02:04:46,344
然后入狱学会做真正的罪犯
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.

1305
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,312
毁了一生
Fucked for life.

1306
02:04:51,190 --> 02:04:53,920
你是过来人，知道会有何下场
You know what happens, because you've been there.

1307
02:04:55,494 --> 02:04:59,658
多明没机会选择生活但基斯有
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life. But Chris did.

1308
02:05:01,801 --> 02:05:04,531
若供出基斯，你会没有案底
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1309
02:05:05,504 --> 02:05:06,903
你可以的…
You can do it...

1310
02:05:07,239 --> 02:05:09,503
为孩子而这样做你可抚养他
...for your kid, so you can raise him.

1311
02:05:13,512 --> 02:05:14,911
你还有什么条件？
What else are you selling?

1312
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:16,379
各种的东西
All kinds of shit.

1313
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:22,685
但我不用说服你因为我是对的
But I don't have to sell this, you know it. This kind of shit here sells itself.

1314
02:05:29,428 --> 02:05:30,759

1322
02:05:57,056 --> 02:05:59,616
我们准备好，她会打电话
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1323

02:06:09,235 --> 02:06:13,228
叫荣谷的人向我们出卖尼尔
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.

荣谷曾是他手下后替洗钱人工作
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew, then went to work for a money launderer.

1328
02:06:18,811 --> 02:06:20,073
他叫宏山
Van Zant.

1329
02:06:20,304 --> 02:06:23,639
现时正派人住宏山家中…
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak...

1330
02:06:23,716 --> 02:06:25,660
因为他今晚较早前被杀
...because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1331
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:29,884
尼尔要对付的人会是荣谷
If Neil goes after anybody else, it's going to be Waingro.

1332
02:06:30,089 --> 02:06:33,650
荣谷正入住侯爵机场酒店套房…
Waingro just got himself a suite at the Airport Marquis...

1333
02:06:33,726 --> 02:06:35,660
并化名詹美臣
...under the name Jamieson.

1334

1338
02:06:50,643 --> 02:06:52,887
也许尼尔会杀他
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1339
02:06:52,937 --> 02:06:54,910
你感到怎样？
How're you feeling?

1340
02:06:55,414 --> 02:06:56,972
我会活的
Hang up, but I'll live.

1341
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:07,386

尼尔还没走
Neil is still here.

1343
02:07:11,096 --> 02:07:12,586
我可感觉到
I can feel it.

1344
02:07:13,432 --> 02:07:14,899
会留多久？
For how long?

1345
02:07:16,402 --> 02:07:18,370
最多七八个小时
Seven, eight hours, maX.

1346
02:07:27,746 --> 02:07:29,077
你做过什么？
What did you do?

1347
02:07:29,481 --> 02:07:30,448
是你做的？
That was you?

1348
02:07:31,016 --> 02:07:32,745
我不是卖金属的
I don't sell metal.

1349
02:07:33,619 --> 02:07:36,611
计划本顺利但现时出了麻烦
Would have been okay, you fly out after. Now it's jammed.

1350
02:07:36,789 --> 02:07:37,999
我们要一起走
We gotta go together.

1351
02:07:38,049 --> 02:07:40,917
那些人和你一起？
Those other people were with you?

1352
02:07:42,728 --> 02:07:44,320
我的朋友米高…
My friend, Michael...

1353
02:07:46,031 --> 02:07:47,555
他知道所冒的险
...he knew the risks.

1354
02:07:52,504 --> 02:07:54,563
身处险境便要冒生命危险
When it rains, you get wet.

1355
02:07:57,343 --> 02:07:58,605
收拾东西
Get packed.

1356
02:08:17,997 --> 02:08:19,692
你为何这样对我？
Why did you do this to me?

1357
02:08:31,877 --> 02:08:33,276
不会有事的
Lt'll be all right.

1358
02:08:33,345 --> 02:08:34,937

Do you understand?

1359
02:08:39,918 --> 02:08:41,715
不会有事的

1365
02:09:20,392 --> 02:09:21,450

情况会不同
It will be different.

1369
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,203

1373
02:10:21,487 --> 02:10:22,852

坐下
Sit down.

1379
02:10:32,131 --> 02:10:33,530
你不生气吗？
Don't you even get angry?

1380

1387
02:10:58,424 --> 02:11:00,654
但你不能看…
But you do not get to watch...

1388
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:02,918

电视机
...television set!

1390
02:11:04,763 --> 02:11:06,128

把电视机放下
Put the television set down.

1392
02:11:14,907 --> 02:11:15,850
我没对你不忠
- I never cheated on you, bitch.

1393

也许你应该

1394
02:11:17,609 --> 02:11:19,053
我应该吗？

我们的处境荒谬
Our situation is absurd.

1397
02:11:27,386 --> 02:11:29,411
住口，洛夫！坐下！
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1398
02:11:33,091 --> 02:11:36,993
我为何要向你解释事情
Why is it that I have to figure things out and eXplain them to you?

1399
02:11:37,162 --> 02:11:39,494
我的说话是认为的亦言出必行
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1400
02:11:40,032 --> 02:11:41,124
多么可敬
How admirable.

1401
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:43,498
可是没什么是和我们有关的
- You bet. - EXcept none of it's about us.

1402
02:11:44,136 --> 02:11:45,103
是的
No.

1403
02:11:46,572 --> 02:11:49,405
我定是抽大麻或服兴奋剂迷糊了
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1404
02:11:50,375 --> 02:11:52,502
但你在我们的生活中犹如死了
...you walk through our life dead.

1405
02:11:53,212 --> 02:11:57,308
我要自贬找洛夫终断我们关系
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1406
02:12:10,329 --> 02:12:12,729
护照、旅行支票、信用卡
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1407
02:12:13,232 --> 02:12:14,494
这飞机…
The plane...

1408
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:17,926
在罗省机场包机站十七号机库
...charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1409
02:12:18,203 --> 02:12:20,103
确定密码是1011山岭
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1410
02:12:23,375 --> 02:12:24,569
飞机会降落…
Touches down...

1411
02:12:24,643 --> 02:12:27,203
等你五分钟然后便起飞
...holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1412
02:12:27,446 --> 02:12:30,973
飞机会通过航空局检查等手续
The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed a flight plan, the works.

1413
02:12:32,518 --> 02:12:33,610
基斯呢？
Where's Chris?

1414
02:12:34,186 --> 02:12:35,244
他走了
He's gone.

1415
02:12:36,655 --> 02:12:37,622
什么？
What?

1416
02:12:38,357 --> 02:12:40,757
他说去找莎莲，他走了
Said he's going on his own. Went to find Charlene.

1417
02:12:40,826 --> 02:12:43,124
是你带他来这儿？
- Did you bring him here? - Yeah, I did.

1418
02:12:44,096 --> 02:12:45,154
怎么回事？
What happened?

1419
02:12:46,265 --> 02:12:47,823
这是个自由国家
It's a free country.

1420
02:12:53,071 --> 02:12:54,902
晚上九时联络我…
Check in with me at 9:00...

1421
02:12:55,274 --> 02:12:57,071
确保一切妥当
...everything is still cool.

1422
02:12:58,777 --> 02:12:59,937
好的
All right.

1423
02:13:23,302 --> 02:13:25,634
我已不知自己在做什么？
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1424
02:13:28,907 --> 02:13:30,704
我知生命短促
I know life is short.

1425
02:13:31,343 --> 02:13:33,436
能活多久是运气
Whatever time you get is luck.

1426
02:13:36,148 --> 02:13:37,706
你想终断这段关系？
You want to walk?

1427
02:13:40,552 --> 02:13:42,349
你现在离去…
You walk right now...

1428
02:13:43,956 --> 02:13:45,548
是自愿的…
...all on your own.

1429
02:13:46,224 --> 02:13:48,886
你自愿选择跟我走
On your own you choose to come with me.

1430
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:56,892
我只知道…
All I know is...

1431
02:13:59,171 --> 02:14:02,436
我无谓再到任何地方去
...there's no point in me going anywhere anymore...

1432
02:14:04,009 --> 02:14:06,000
若我会独自一人…
...if it's going to be alone...

1433
02:14:07,045 --> 02:14:08,569
没有你在身边
...without you.

1434
02:15:07,698 --> 02:15:09,665
我有个活的
I got a live one.

1435
02:15:09,967 --> 02:15:11,802
我会等
I'll hold.

1436
02:15:14,513 --> 02:15:15,980
让基斯看见你
Show yourself.

1437
02:15:17,082 --> 02:15:18,674
住口！
- Do it. - Shut up!

1438
02:15:23,021 --> 02:15:25,251
只需在窗前站一秒
Now, just one second at the window...

1439
02:15:26,491 --> 02:15:28,288
此事便会了结
...and it's all over.

1440
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:19,362
朋友…
Hey, man...

1441
02:17:20,831 --> 02:17:24,302
你知这附近有地方租吗？
...you know any place to rent around here?

1442
02:17:25,869 --> 02:17:29,896
杂货店墙上有招租告示


1443
02:17:42,227 --> 02:17:43,251
不是他
It's not him.

1444
02:17:43,328 --> 02:17:44,693
不是基斯
It's not Chris.

1445
02:17:52,838 --> 02:17:54,533
是指挥部
Unit 2, this is Command.

1446
02:17:55,006 --> 02:17:57,337
截停他和查看身份
Take him at the street.Check him out.

1447
02:18:25,303 --> 02:18:26,770
他叫庄彼得
He's John Peterson.

1448
02:18:26,838 --> 02:18:29,238
有效的身份证，车辆登记人是…
Valid ID. Car's registered to...

1449
02:18:29,407 --> 02:18:31,360
布基赞
...Bukowski, Gene.

1450
02:18:31,710 --> 02:18:32,870
向运输署查核过
Ran it to DMV.

1451
02:18:32,944 --> 02:18:34,241
没有不妥
It's clean.

1452
02:18:37,215 --> 02:18:38,307
让他走
Let him go.

1453
02:18:38,884 --> 02:18:39,976
知道
Roger.

1454
02:18:40,252 --> 02:18:42,243
谢谢，晚安
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1455
02:18:44,222 --> 02:18:45,086
不是他
It's no-go.

1456
02:18:55,467 --> 02:18:58,300
我们等时你想喝咖啡吗？
Would you like a cup of coffee while we wait?

1457
02:18:58,403 --> 02:19:00,132
那会很不错
Yeah, that would be nice.

1458
02:19:31,269 --> 02:19:32,634
你有什么消息？
What do you got?

1459
02:19:32,704 --> 02:19:34,171
没事发生
Nothing's happening.

1460
02:19:47,385 --> 02:19:48,852
是云信
Hello, it's Vincent.

1461
02:19:49,487 --> 02:19:50,579
有何动静？
What do you got?

1462
02:19:50,655 --> 02:19:52,885
没有，荣谷去拿冰
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1463
02:19:53,458 --> 02:19:54,550
就这样
That's it.

1464
02:20:03,335 --> 02:20:04,666
你知道吗？
You know what?

1465
02:20:07,205 --> 02:20:08,672
尼尔走了
Neil is gone.

1466
02:20:13,745 --> 02:20:15,337
像鸟儿般飞走
Flying like a bird.

1467
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:17,211
你怎知道？
How do you know?

1468
02:20:19,317 --> 02:20:20,249
我们仍然有诱饵
We still got bait!

1469
02:20:20,318 --> 02:20:20,894
也许仍有时间
- Maybe some time! - What do we got?

1470
02:20:20,944 --> 02:20:23,918
我们有什么？
What do we got?

1471
02:20:24,823 --> 02:20:26,814
旅途愉快，杂种
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1472
02:20:28,259 --> 02:20:29,726
你很了得
You were good.

1473
02:20:31,563 --> 02:20:33,224
我到酒店去
I'm going to the hotel.

1474
02:20:34,499 --> 02:20:36,490
我会洗澡
I'm going to take a shower...

1475
02:20:37,469 --> 02:20:39,903
然后睡个昏天暗地

1476
02:22:49,192 --> 02:22:52,294
来

1477
02:22:59,377 --> 02:23:00,344
醒来吧
Come on.

1478
02:23:09,087 --> 02:23:10,179
操
Shit.

1479
02:23:19,430 --> 02:23:21,193
浪费生命
Motherfucking waste.

1480
02:23:24,636 --> 02:23:27,469
浑蛋经常自毁
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1481
02:23:27,539 --> 02:23:28,801
你不会死的
Not you, baby.

1482
02:23:28,907 --> 02:23:30,135
你不会的
Not you.

1483
02:23:35,446 --> 02:23:38,176
她会在哪儿？她叫罗兰
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1484
02:23:38,349 --> 02:23:41,182
古罗兰，她该在这儿的

1490
02:24:06,711 --> 02:24:08,588
冷静下来
- There's your mama. - Let's just calm down.

1491
02:24:08,638 --> 02:24:11,341
她服用药物吗？

1493
02:24:16,754 --> 02:24:20,246
她割断两条动脉她没有脉搏

她的血压下降

1495
02:24:22,026 --> 02:24:23,891
要给她插管
So is the respiration. You have to intubate her.

准备好了

1497

最后一次见她时是什么时候？

1498
02:24:29,234 --> 02:24:29,876
我不知道
I don't know.

1499
02:24:29,926 --> 02:24:31,834
你在哪儿找到她？
Where did you find her?

1500
02:24:31,903 --> 02:24:33,063
浴缸

1501
02:24:33,496 --> 02:24:37,159
给她注射大针管的盐水

紧按出血的血管

Give me two units, O-negative. Let's type and cross her for siX.

1504
02:24:44,282 --> 02:24:47,683
呼吸专家呢？我们需要帮忙
Where is respiratory? We need more help. Get them down now.

02:24:47,719 --> 02:24:50,745
准备插管后照X光
Let's have X-ray ready for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1506
02:24:57,262 --> 02:25:00,288
令媛已做过手术及在疗养室
Your daughter's out of surgery and she's in the recovery room.

1507

她情况稳定
Her vital signs are stable.

1508
02:25:01,966 --> 02:25:04,628
医生很快会跟你说
The surgeon will speak to you in a few moments.

1509
02:25:04,736 --> 02:25:05,703
她没事吧？
She's okay?

1510
02:25:05,803 --> 02:25:06,929
她很好
She's doing good.

1511
02:25:07,005 --> 02:25:08,596
她会没事的
She'll be okay.

1512
02:25:09,007 --> 02:25:10,907
她不会有事
She's going to be okay.

1513
02:25:11,109 --> 02:25:14,010
我的女儿，她为何这样对自己？
Oh, my baby. Why did she do this to herself?

1514
02:25:15,446 --> 02:25:18,540
看她把自己怎么了
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

1515
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:25,616
没事的，不会有事的
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1516
02:25:26,024 --> 02:25:28,151
我在这儿，不会到别处去
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1517
02:25:28,226 --> 02:25:31,024
明白吗？我不会到别处去
Do you understand? I ain't going anywhere.

1518
02:25:45,943 --> 02:25:46,910
是我

1519
02:25:47,545 --> 02:25:50,309
飞机已在半空，你准时离去
Plane's in the air now. You're right on time.

1520
02:25:50,915 --> 02:25:54,849
仍找不到可信任的司机
I still can't find a driver...so that's in the trust.

1521
02:25:55,053 --> 02:25:56,452
还有一事…
One other thing...

1522
02:25:57,455 --> 02:25:59,013
我得告诉你

你找的人在候爵酒店化名詹美臣
The guy you want is in the Marquis under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1524
02:26:04,195 --> 02:26:05,992
我看你不想找他吧
...which I figure you wouldn't.

1525
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:07,629
你说的对
You figured right.

1526
02:26:08,066 --> 02:26:09,658
再见，兄弟
So, so long, brother.

1527
02:26:11,869 --> 02:26:13,336
保重了
You take it easy.

1528
02:26:14,038 --> 02:26:15,369
你不用担心什么
You're home free.

1529

保重
Take it easy.

1530
02:26:29,687 --> 02:26:30,779

02:26:31,089 --> 02:26:32,283
没什么
Nothing.

1532
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:33,852

1535
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,228
有的
There's time.

1536
02:27:46,130 --> 02:27:48,792
我很快回来，让车子开动吧

1537
02:28:31,042 --> 02:28:31,872

1538
02:28:31,943 --> 02:28:33,205
房间餐饮部
This is room service.

1539
02:28:33,277 --> 02:28:37,236
詹美臣要了食物但房号弄错了
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they screwed up his room number. What is it?

1540
02:28:37,315 --> 02:28:39,146
经常会弄错，
- They're always doing that. - I know.

1541
02:28:39,217 --> 02:28:40,479
是1735号房
1735.

1542
02:28:40,751 --> 02:28:42,013
谢谢
Thank you.

1543
02:30:25,823 --> 02:30:27,552
请注意
Your attention, please.

1544
02:30:27,625 --> 02:30:29,991
现时响起火警警报
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

1545
02:30:31,262 --> 02:30:32,729
不用惶恐
Do not panic.

1546
02:30:32,930 --> 02:30:34,761
不要乘坐升降机
Do not take the elevators.

1547
02:30:40,037 --> 02:30:41,163
我留在这儿
I'm staying here.

1548
02:30:41,238 --> 02:30:44,605
我查看楼梯若有烟便会要你走
I'll check the stairs. If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1549
02:30:49,246 --> 02:30:51,612
我该通知她父亲吗？
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1550
02:30:52,650 --> 02:30:54,880
他在内华达山脉某处
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1551
02:30:56,921 --> 02:30:58,582
她选上你
And she chose you.

1552
02:31:01,192 --> 02:31:03,023
选你的房间自杀
She picked your place.

1553
02:31:05,196 --> 02:31:07,187
这样做是不对的
It's not right, what happened to her.

1554
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:08,458
是的
No, it's not.

1555
02:31:25,116 --> 02:31:26,879
是否有方法…
Is there any way that...

1556
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:31,279
可克服我们间的问题？
...it could work out between us?

1557
02:31:34,091 --> 02:31:36,491
我希望说有
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1558
02:31:36,827 --> 02:31:37,885
可是…
But...

1559
02:31:38,062 --> 02:31:39,654
到最后…
...in the end...

1560
02:31:44,568 --> 02:31:46,297
一如你说的…
It's like you said:

1561
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:50,805
我沉迷于…
All I am...

1562
02:31:51,509 --> 02:31:53,602
追捕我的罪犯
...is what I'm going after.

1563
02:32:00,985 --> 02:32:03,215
我不是你想要的人
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1564
02:32:14,298 --> 02:32:15,856
若你要走便走吧
Go on, if you have to.

1565
02:32:19,036 --> 02:32:20,196
我会留下
I'll stay.

1566
02:32:20,271 --> 02:32:22,171
我没事，我可应付
I'm okay. I can handle this.

1567
02:32:25,376 --> 02:32:26,843
你保重
Just be careful.

1568
02:32:27,611 --> 02:32:30,273
给我电话让我知道你没事
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1569
02:32:31,382 --> 02:32:32,349
好吗？
Okay?

1570
02:33:33,177 --> 02:33:35,042
酒店保安，发生火警
Security. There's a fire on three.

1571
02:33:35,513 --> 02:33:37,310
各楼层的人均要疏散
We have to evacuate all floors.

1572
02:33:37,381 --> 02:33:38,848
我不能离去
I can't leave here.

1573
02:33:47,892 --> 02:33:50,952
我们何不先谈一下？
Why don't we just talk about this a bit, brother?

1574
02:34:05,209 --> 02:34:06,540
他在十七楼
He's here on 17.

1575
02:34:09,513 --> 02:34:10,741
望着我
Look at me.

1576
02:34:10,881 --> 02:34:11,973
望着我！
Look at me!

1577
02:34:15,286 --> 02:34:16,378
望着我！
Look at me!

1578
02:34:48,319 --> 02:34:49,786
罗省警方！别动！
LAPD! Don't move!

1579
02:34:49,854 --> 02:34:51,685
手放在头上！
Put your hands on your head!

1580
02:35:27,191 --> 02:35:28,886
将我转到五号频道
Switch me to TAC 5.

1581
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:30,922
卡索斯…
Casals...

1582
02:35:31,228 --> 02:35:32,160
JJ…
JJ...

1583
02:35:32,997 --> 02:35:34,259
泽加
Drucker, JJ...

1584
02:35:34,431 --> 02:35:36,831
我在大堂接近楼梯井
I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.

1585
02:35:36,901 --> 02:35:38,027
有什么事？
What have you got?

1586
02:35:38,135 --> 02:35:41,298
有人乘另一升降机往十七楼
Teams are moving up the other elevators to the 17th-floor elevators.

1587
02:35:41,338 --> 02:35:44,774
因火警警钟响起升降机不能用
All out of commission because of the fire alarm. People everywhere.

1588
02:35:44,875 --> 02:35:46,274
好的，知道
Fine. 10-4.

1589
02:38:11,255 --> 02:38:12,813
把枪给我
Let me have that shot.

1590
02:44:30,967 --> 02:44:33,128
早说过我不会回狱中的
Told you I'm never going back.

1591
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:38,332
是的
Yeah.
