WOMAN:<i> Stabilize.</i>

2
00:02:55,342 --> 00:02:56,426
Okay here.

3
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,969
Where's the portable X-Ray?

4
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,786
(engine starts)

5
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,008
MAN: Check, charge, or cash?

6
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,010
Cash and, uh...

7
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,974
Make it out to Jack's
Demolition, Tucson.

8
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,518
78830?

9
00:03:55,444 --> 00:03:56,445
Okay.

10
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,596
(man on television talking)

11
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,866
Oh, god.

12
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,020
(water running)

13
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,211
Hey,

14
00:05:36,211 --> 00:05:38,004
taking me to breakfast?

15
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,965
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

16
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,134
Hey, Vincent.

17
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,095
Mom, where are my barrettes?

18
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:47,180
-Hi sweetie.
-I saw them on the kitchen table.

19
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,390
They're not there. I already
checked.

20
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:50,141
Want me to make coffee?

21
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,018
No school today?

22
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,562
My dad's picking me up. He's
taking me to the new building

23
00:05:53,562 --> 00:05:54,938
and then to lunch.

24
00:05:54,938 --> 00:05:56,398
Try under the cushions
on the sofa.

25
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:03,154
He's already a half-hour late.

26
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,533
Is he going to show or is
that son of a bitch going to
stand her up like last time?

27
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,034
I'll make coffee.

28
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,286
I'm out of time, baby.

29
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,343
Mom, where are my barrettes?
They are not on the couch.

30
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,345
Oh, wear the blue ones.

31
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,847
I don't want to wear the blue
ones.

32
00:06:28,847 --> 00:06:30,765
They don't match.

33
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:31,975
Did you check in your bathroom?

34
00:06:31,975 --> 00:06:33,560
I checked everywhere.

35
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,978
Well, what do you
want me to do?

36
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:37,355
Find them! Mom, pay attention!

37
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,107
All right, sweetie. All right.
What?

38
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:40,942
Daddy's going to be here!

39
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,485
-Well, okay. He's going to be--
-I'm not going to be ready!

40
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,987
I can't be late!

41
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,822
-You won't be late.
-No, I will be late!

42
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,282
Okay, before daddy comes,

43
00:06:47,282 --> 00:06:49,075
we can find them if we look
together.

44
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,036
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

45
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,371
It's all right. It's all right.

46
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,999
We'll find them together--you and me.
We will find them together,

47
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,709
just relax.

48
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,962
He won't come before we find
them. I promise you.

49
00:07:07,886 --> 00:07:10,180
(person speaking Spanish)

50
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,932
Hey, give me another refill.

51
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,895
(man speaking Spanish)

52
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:26,029
What's your name?

53
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,947
Waingro.

54
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,411
(grunts)

55
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,540
You're Michael, huh?

56
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,556
Do you guys always work
together?

57
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,557
All the time.

58
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,810
Real tight crew, huh?

59
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,812
Real tight.

60
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,230
Yeah. If this works good,

61
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:02,774
I'd consider going again, you
know?

62
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,610
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

63
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,497
How's he doing?

64
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,374
100%.

65
00:08:19,374 --> 00:08:21,334
Right on schedule.

66
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,503
Made a right on Venice

67

68
00:08:27,382 --> 00:08:28,758

00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,866
Just crossed over the number-one

72
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,367
300 yards from you now.

73
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,869
Get set.

74
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:57,370
I am.

75
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,173

Hey, Slick, you see that shit

86
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,533
coming out of their ears?

87
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,826
They can't fucking hear you.

88
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,286
Cool it.

89
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,009
I got it. I got it.

90
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,765
You had to fuck with me.

91
00:12:03,765 --> 00:12:05,642
You want to fuck with me?

92

Come on!

93
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,210
What the fuck are you doing?

94
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,378
-What did you do?
-That guy was making a move.

95
00:12:33,378 --> 00:12:34,379
Let's go!

96
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,181

99
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,295
Step out here, sir.

100
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,255
I heard them.

101
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,223
(explosion)

102
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,280
A million six.

103
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,073
40 cents on the dollar.

104
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:45,033
640,000 for you.

105
00:13:45,033 --> 00:13:47,577
150 front money.

106
00:13:48,411 --> 00:13:49,912
Get you the rest two, three
days.

107
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,874
Know who own these?

108
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:59,213
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

109
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,382
Roger Van Zant.

110
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,176
Owns banks in the Caymans.

111
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,469
Runs investment portfolios

112
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,179
for offshore drug money,

113
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,430
stuff like that.

114
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,057
So?

115
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,433
So, you ripped off his
bearer bonds.

116
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,269
He's got insurance.

117
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,687
That's the point.

118
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:15,688
He collects 100% from the
insurance.

119
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,148
He's a player.

120
00:14:17,148 --> 00:14:18,191
Maybe he buys his bonds back
from us...

121
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,318
for 60% of their value

122
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,820
and make 40% on top of the 100%.

123
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,282
Sell it to him instead of on the
street--

124
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,077
That's an extra 320,000 to you.

125
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,703
Try it on him.

126
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,163
Kelso called.

127
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,623
About what?

128
00:14:33,623 --> 00:14:34,832
A score he's putting out

129
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,667
he wants you to look at.

130
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,461
Why do I need his score for?

131
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,796
I got my own.

132
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,506
He says it's clean and low eight
figures.

133
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:43,758
9 a.m. tomorrow.

134
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:45,093
What happened out there?

135
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:48,137
Don't ask.

136
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,309
(police radio chatter)

137
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,742
(woman talking on police radio)

138
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,169
MAN: Yeah. Just chalk it first.

139
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,713
Did you check his head?

140
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,965
Find the ambulance?

141
00:15:23,965 --> 00:15:25,299
Dumped it four blocks from here.

142
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:27,218
22nd Street between Figueroa and
Flower.

143
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,720
They torched it.

144
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,055
Burned everything-- the guns,
clothes, everything.

145
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:34,392
They were airborne.

146
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,393
They taped the last few seconds

147
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:39,147
of the black and whites doing
demolition derby.

148
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,024
Stolen out of Fresno two weeks
ago--

149
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,734
The yellow pickup out of
Whittier

150
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,486
day before yesterday.

151
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,321
You taking this one,
Lieutenant...

152
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,867
or does it stay in division?

153
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:52,243
This look like gangbangers

154
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,453
working the local 7-eleven to
you?

155
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,330
Robbery/homicide's taking it,
yeah.

156
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:58,541
-All yours.
-We got three motorists.

157
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,793
All they saw were men with
masks.  They were distant.

158
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:02,587
Console-tv man over there,
however--

159
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,422
He was closer.

160
00:16:05,131 --> 00:16:06,883
He I.D. anybody?

161
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:09,677
Well, he was hiding. He heard
it, mostly.

162
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,264
Okay, what about them?

163
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,473
All right now.

164
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:16,017
According to tv man,

165
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,686
-this guy started mouthing off.
-Smart.

166
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,479
Yeah, somebody called a guard
Slick.

167
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,939
Slick?

168
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,816
Yeah. Now this guy--
I figure this guy

169
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,860
went for that hold-out piece

170
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,987
ankle holster, right?

171
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:32,408
From here...bang, bang, bang,
bang, bang.

172
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:33,826
This side.

173
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,037
This guy here got what appears
to be

174
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:37,413
a double-tap entry wound

175
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,247
to the sternum.

176
00:16:39,332 --> 00:16:40,416
Tattooing around the head wound,

177
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,834
scorched bone, close range--

178
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:43,711
Probably executed.

179
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,088
And it was a million six

180
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,965
in bearer bonds,

181
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,717
and they ignored the loose cash.

182
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,219
Because they had no time,

183
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,720
because they were on a clock,

184
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,804
which means they knew

185
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,556
our response time to a 2-11,

186
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:58,976
had our air, immobilized it,
entered,

187
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,479
escaped in under three minutes.

188
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,688
It's a good spot here.

189
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:04,273
We got good escape routes--

190
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,900
Two freeways...

191
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,443
within a quarter of a mile.

192
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,070
Traffic video camera?

193
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,280
Probably disabled. Check it
anyway.

194
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,865
You recognize the M.O.?

195
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:14,075
M.O...

196
00:17:14,075 --> 00:17:15,910
Is that they're good.

197
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,537
Once it escalated into murder
1B for all of them

198
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,623
after they killed the first two
guards,

199
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,041
they didn't hesitate.

200
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,834
Popped guard number three
because...

201
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:26,128
What difference does it make?

202
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,381
Why leave a living witness?

203
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:29,507
Drop of a hat,

204
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,801
these guys will rock and roll.

205
00:17:32,635 --> 00:17:34,095
MAN: Ticket this.

206
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:36,222
The shape charge...

207
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,809
The shape charge indicates that
they are technically proficient--

208
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,560
Proficient enough to go in on
the prowl,

209
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,687
so let's start looking

210
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,313
for recent highline burglaries

211
00:17:44,313 --> 00:17:45,815
that have mystified us.

212
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,817
Run Slick as an alias to the
FBI.

213
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,110
You'll get the phone book.

214
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,486
Do it anyway.

215
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,614
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

216
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,157
Check the usual fences.

217
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:57,410
You and I will check Cuzomano
and Torena.

218
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,870
I want you to take Goldstein and
Alfaro.

219
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,330
Hang in with forensics.

220
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:04,083
From the bomb squad, I want the
explosive.

221
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,751
If we're lucky, it's exotic.

222
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,545
We can trace the sale.

223
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:12,591
Get your hand out of that
man's pocket, Rachel.

224
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,851
Y'all want some pie?

225
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:33,154
Got to go to the john.

226
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:48,252
(restaurant chatter
in background)

227
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,393
Look, I had to get it on, man.

228
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,812
He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

229
00:19:07,313 --> 00:19:09,315
(man grunts in pain)

230
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:17,907
Damn it! God--

231
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,619
Split's in the car.

232
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:24,997
I took out of ours evenly

233
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,708
to make up for his full end

234
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,793
because I want to pay off

235
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,294
and get rid of this motherfucker

236
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,546
right now.

237
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,695
Aah!

238
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:59,740
♪♪

239
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,950
(grunts)

240
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,627
Hold it!

241
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,476
(siren blares)

242
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:01,719
(door opens)

243
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,387
(door closes)

244
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:08,476

00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:45,387

(cricket sounds)

247
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,767
MAN: Hey.

248
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,103
Where's the rest?

249
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,355
We're late.

250
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:55,940
You look too good to go out.

251
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,776
I could just jump you right
here.

252
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,905
Where is it?

253
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:04,114
Uh, squared the bookies, baby.

254
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:05,324
There's more in a couple days,
so don't sweat it.

255
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,951
Come on. We really are late.

256
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,369
Yeah. Come on.

257
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,579
You got to be kidding me.

258
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,207
Honey, it ain't worth

259
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:15,251
the risks you take for 8,000--

260
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:17,711
Like in "Risk Versus Reward,"
baby.

261
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:20,923
Let's go. Get your coat.

262
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,051
There's no point talking to you

263
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,886
because all you are is a
child growing older.

264
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,346
What's that supposed to mean?

265
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,265
It means we're not making
forward progress

266
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:31,308
like real, grown-up adults
living our lives.

267
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:33,936
Because I'm married to
a gambling junkie who won't listen.

268
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,564
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

269
00:22:36,564 --> 00:22:38,023
(keys jingling)

270
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:38,857
What am I doing

271
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,776
in this rat-bastard situation
here?

272
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,695
You're not, what do you want from me?

273
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:45,447
Leave the bankbook and the car keys
in the kitchen on your way out the door.

274
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,908
-Now, are we going or--
-You can keep that other crap,

275
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,786
but Dominick would go with me.

276
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:52,621
Don't you even think about--

277
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,499
(baby crying)

278
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,669
(glass breaks)

279
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,296
(door slams)

280
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,716
(baby continues crying)

281
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,890
(revving engine)

282
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,604
(telephone rings)

283
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,188
(ring)

284
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,858
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena
called back.

285
00:23:21,984 --> 00:23:23,861
Albert Torena call Vincent?

286
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,070
MAN: No.

287
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,031
No. Report came in.

288
00:23:27,031 --> 00:23:29,033
The explosive was dy-ex--

289
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,035
<i>Linear-shaped charge used in
demolition.</i>

290
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,536
<i>You can pick it up with a
driver's license</i>

291
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,122
in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

292
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:37,082
Too common to trace the sale,
Vincent.

293
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:39,418
Oh, that's wonderful.

294
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,272
Are you all right?

295
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,525
What happened?
Where've you been?

296
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,985
Work.

297
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:08,072
Lauren's dad show up?

298
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,492
Didn't call. Didn't show.

299
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:14,578
We waited for you till 10:30.

300
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,122
Now, does this guy have any idea

301
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,583
what's going on with this kid?

302
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,504
I don't know.

303
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:24,963
Fucking jerk.

304
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:28,258
Well, is she okay?

305
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,803
She's been in her room all day,

306
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,930
so no, she's not okay

307
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,181
neither am I.

308
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:36,934
Uh, I made dinner... for us

309
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,185
four hours ago.

310
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,271
Um, every time I try to maintain

311
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,481
a consistent mood between us,

312
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:45,025
you withdraw.

313
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,486
I got three dead bodies

314
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:50,406
on a sidewalk off Venice
Boulevard,

315
00:24:50,406 --> 00:24:51,740
Justine.

316
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,078
I'm sorry... if the goddamn
chicken

317
00:24:56,078 --> 00:25:00,249
got... overcooked.

318
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,351
<i>Seven men in Denmark</i>

321
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,556
MAN: Coffee, sir?

322
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,974
Please.

323
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,482
Will you pass the cream?

324
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,443
Thanks.

325
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:10,903
What did you get?

326
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,238
What?

327
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,407
What are you reading?

328
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,081
Book about metals.

329
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:29,421
"Stress fractures in titanium."

330
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,591
What kind of work you do?

331
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,012
Lady, why are you so interested

332
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,265
in what I read or what I do?

333
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,354
I've seen you in the store
from time to time.

334
00:26:45,354 --> 00:26:47,231
What store?

335
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:49,107
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work
there.

336
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:52,027
Uh, if you don't want to talk to
me,

337
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,320
It's okay

338
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,988
Sorry I bothered you.

339
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,459
I didn't mean to be rude.

340
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,670
I didn't recognize you.

341
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,673
I work in metals. I'm a
salesman.

342
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,258
My name's Neil.

343
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:21,223
I'm Eady.

344
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,810
You like working there?

345
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:27,646
Sure.

346
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,773
I get a discount,

347
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,775
and there's a whole section of
books in my area.

348
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,694
What area's that?

349
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,071
Graphic design.

350
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:39,074
I do, um, letterheads and
logo types at night,

351
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:41,326
and the store's a day job

352
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,870
till I get enough going.

353
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,497
Who do you do that for?

354
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:49,710
Uh, a restaurant.

355
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,754
I did their menus and, um,

356
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:57,175
a small record label.

357
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,386
CDs--

358
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:01,930
I've done two so far.

359
00:28:03,557 --> 00:28:05,726
Did you go to school for that?

360
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,394
Yeah.

361
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,645
Yeah. I went to Parsons.

362
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,439
Oh, where's that?

363
00:28:10,439 --> 00:28:11,857
New York City.

364
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:14,526
And how long you been out here?

365
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:17,362
About a year.

366
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,864
Do you like it?

367
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,034
Not really.

368
00:28:22,034 --> 00:28:24,286
I'm mostly here for the work.

369
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,669
Live in this neighborhood?

370
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:36,798
Uh, no. I live um, kind of above
Sunset Plaza.

371
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,467
It's actually kind of a--

372
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,552
It's a little house that I rent,

373
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,637
and it's kind of run-down

374
00:28:41,637 --> 00:28:45,182
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

375
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,683
What about you?

376
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,644
I live up here.

377
00:28:48,644 --> 00:28:51,688
That's very funny.

378
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,024
(Eady laughs)

379
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,860
So where's your family from
originally?

380
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:00,864
Oh... They're Scots-Irish.

381
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,491
They, um,

382
00:29:02,491 --> 00:29:03,575
they emigrated to Appalachia

383
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:07,871
In the late 1700s.

384
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,123
Where are you from?

385
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,917
The Bay Area.

386
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,920
Are your folks there?

387
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:19,299
No. My mother died a long time
ago,

388
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,342
and my father--

389
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:22,636
I don't know where he is.

390
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,096
Got a brother somewhere.

391
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:32,396
You have a tight family. I can
tell.

392
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,398
-Yeah.
-Right?

393
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,900
You're right.

394
00:29:42,906 --> 00:29:44,741
(sigh)

395
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,952
City of Lights.

396
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,957
In Fiji, they have these...

397
00:29:51,957 --> 00:29:53,500
iridescent algae

398
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,253
that come out once a year in the
water.

399
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:58,964
That's what it looks like out
there.

400
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,967
You been there?

401
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:05,345
No. I'm going there someday.

402
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,847
Oh, yeah?

403
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,522
You travel a lot?

404
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,151
Yeah.

405
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,695
Traveling makes you lonely?

406
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:30,537
I--I'm alone. I am not lonely.

407
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,997
You?

408
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,999
Real lonely.

409
00:31:58,834 --> 00:32:01,086
(whinny)

410
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,262
(sheep bleating)

411
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,648
(dogs barking)

412
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,668
Albert!

413
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,213
-Shit.
-Albert!

414
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,382
Vincent, what are you doing
here?

415
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,466
You crazy?

416
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,177
This ain't Disneyland, man.

417
00:32:50,177 --> 00:32:51,678
You were suppose to get back to
me last night, Albert.

418
00:32:51,678 --> 00:32:52,679
Where the fuck you been?

419
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,432
I couldn't break free Vincent,
you know?

420
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:58,059
Let's violate his ass right now.

421
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,896
I do for you. You don't do for
me.

422
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:01,897
Is that it?

423
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:05,692
Vincent, man I swear, I was out
all night man.

424
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,694
I'm hidden like one of them
Flamingo Matador guys.

425
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:10,530
What's Flamingo? That's got
nothing to do with me.

426
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:11,948
I was cutting it real smooth.

427
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:14,326
I'm generating leads and shit
for you.

428
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:15,660
I'm a dancer, man.

429
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,204
Bullshit.

430
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:19,247
I paged you all day. I can't
stand paging.

431
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,250
You're a speedfreak jacking
Methamphetamine again.

432
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,585
Oh, man, where's your empathy,
brother?

433
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,669
It's a substance-abuse problem.

434
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:25,921
Empathy was yesterday.

435
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:28,173
Today, you're wasting my
motherfucking time.

436
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,050
Vincent, man, look--

437
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:33,553
Did you fall in love? Come on,
did you fall in love last night?

438
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,471
And you went off somewhere?

439
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:35,305
Vincent.

440
00:33:35,305 --> 00:33:38,266
Just tell me that. I'll settle
for it. You know what I
mean? I'll buy that.

441
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:39,684
Vin-Vincent.

442
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,186
Give me all you got!

443
00:33:41,186 --> 00:33:42,103
Vincent--

444
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,813
Give me all you got!

445
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,815
I swear, man, my brother Richard

446
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:46,900
is going to talk to you.

447
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:49,819
I heard Richard?

448
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:50,904
He going to talk to you.

449
00:33:50,904 --> 00:33:52,781
Richard? Richard?

450
00:33:52,781 --> 00:33:54,532
He's gonna meet you man, I
swear. Tonight!

451
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,742
He's not here, is he?

452
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,869
No. He'll meet you tonight.

453
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:59,329
Tonight? What happened to right
now?

454
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:02,165
I--I--I implored him because I
knew

455
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,416
you was coming this a.m.

456
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,085
This is a bunch of bullshit.

457
00:34:05,085 --> 00:34:08,630
No, I swear. He said no.
Because he in Phoenix.

458
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:09,756
Ah. Cause he in Phoenix.

459
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,216
By the time I get to Phoenix

460
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,592
listen, I swear, man--

461
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:15,428
<i>♪ He'll be risin' ♪</i>

462
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:19,766
<i>♪ He'll probably leave a note
right on the door ♪</i>

463
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:22,185
Tonight's the best i can
do for you man.

464
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:23,436
You know...

465
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,437
He'll mee-- he'll meet you

466
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:27,691
at BJ's on Alvarado...

467
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,734
at 2 A.M.

468
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,944
Be there.

469
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,487
You be there, too.

470
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,407
Vincent, I can't be there. I got
things to do.

471
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:37,117
Vince, I got things to do,
I got places to be.

472
00:34:37,117 --> 00:34:38,493
Hey, hey, hey.

473
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,703
(glass shatters)

474
00:34:39,703 --> 00:34:41,496
Be there.

475
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,670
Don't waste my motherfucking
time!

476
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,006
(dog barking)

477
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,384
What is it?

478
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,512
It's a bank.

479
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,055
It depots cash on Thursday

480
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:01,266
for distribution to all the
other branches

481
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,268
to cover Friday payroll checks,

482
00:35:03,268 --> 00:35:05,562
so on Thursdays, the command
branch

483
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:06,771
has got a full whack.

484
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:08,273
On the prowl or strong?

485
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,774
Strong. Through the front door.

486
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:11,067
How many guys?

487
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,777
Four or three plus the driver.

488
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,529
You walk in, you knock them
over and you walk out.

489
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,864
And you want 100,000 in advance

490
00:35:15,864 --> 00:35:17,532
against a 10% cut for<i> that?</i>

491
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,075
Uh-huh.

492
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,785
Sounds like an address to a
cowboy score.

493
00:35:20,785 --> 00:35:22,454
They hit the holdup alarms,

494
00:35:22,454 --> 00:35:25,749
I got to get out before the cops
show. What is that?

495
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,542
They have three holdup alarms--

496
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,669
Two telco and a cellular.

497
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,255
See, but the signals

498
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,507
aren't going anywhere because...

499
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,800
See, the night before,

500
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,511
you cut in and trick out

501
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,513
the alarm system computer

502
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:41,806
to turn itself

503
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,309
and the video recorders off...

504
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,686
20 minutes before you walk in
the door.

505
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,064
Architectural, Electrical
engineering plans?

506
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:50,607
I got all of that, I got
schematics.

507
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:51,733
I got the boards are already
built.

508
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,985
They go straight into the cpu.

509
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,446
What's the estimate?

510
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,659
12.1, 12.2 million.

511
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,332
You're on.

512
00:36:07,332 --> 00:36:08,917
Congratulations.

513
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:11,336
And to give you a little idea...

514
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,128
of where my estimates come from,

515
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:13,421
this is a printout--

516
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,882
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

517
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:18,426
Be that as it may. My way, you get 100%
from the insurance company,

518
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:20,136
and take the bonds back from us

519
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,638
<i>at 60 cents on the dollar,</i>

520
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:23,598
<i>and make yourself another 40%.</i>

521
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:29,562
The operation doesn't skip a
beat. Everybody makes out.

522
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:32,023
Sure. You got a deal.

523
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,483
Good, because there's no
percentage if everyone

524
00:36:33,483 --> 00:36:35,819
gets their underwear in a twist
over this.

525
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:37,570
Yeah. Have your man call me,

526
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,905
and we'll set the meet.

527
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:40,907
Yeah, okay.

528
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,451
Nice talking to you.

529
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,453
You going to deal with these
guys?

530
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,496
So word's out on the street

531
00:36:46,496 --> 00:36:48,206
it's okay to steal my stuff?

532
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:51,000
I'm going to kill the sons of
bitches.

533
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,127
Have Harry bring me the
spreadsheets

534
00:36:52,127 --> 00:36:54,754
for Canary Islands offshore.

535
00:36:59,259 --> 00:37:00,969
As I was saying, that's not
really an estimate.

536
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,637
Those are exact figures.

537
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,264
I have the printout here of the
castro of the bank

538
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,765
for the past two months.

539
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,809
How did you get this
information?

540
00:37:07,809 --> 00:37:09,185
It just comes to you.

541
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,563
This stuff just flies
through the air.

542
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,273
They send this information
out-- It's beamed out all over
the fuckin' place.

543
00:37:13,273 --> 00:37:14,732
All you have to do is know
how to grab it.

544
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,318
See, I know how to grab it.

545
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:24,826
Um, the--okay, here we go.

546
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:26,286
13.9 million.

547
00:37:29,289 --> 00:37:30,582
I bought it.

548
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,293
Good. What did I tell you?

549
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,006
Here.

550
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,508
We're on.

551
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,178
Call Van Zant. Collect the
money.

552
00:37:43,428 --> 00:37:44,429
How is he?

553
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:46,306
He's a businessman.

554
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,767
Okay.

555
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,783
(door closes)

556
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,915
(phone dialing)

557
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,168
(ring)

558
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,127
(telephone rings)

559
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,253
CHARLENE: Avocado.

560
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,006
Ah cah do.

561
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:21,299
(ring)

562
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,467
Hello.

563
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,427
NEIL:<i> yeah, hello.</i>

564
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,970
Chris is at my place.

565
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,975
What's wrong?

566
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,685
Husband and wife stuff.

567
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:35,939
I'll let him sleep it off here.

568
00:38:35,939 --> 00:38:37,649
(hangs up)

569
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,828
What happened to you?

570
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,335
When are you going to get some
furniture?

571
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,295
When I get around to it.

572
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,341
Charlene's going to leave me.

573
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,844
Why?

574
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:12,392
Not enough steaks in the
freezer.

575
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,852
With everything we've been
doing?

576
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:19,357
Vegas, the Super Bowl cleaned me
out.

577
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,318
When you going to get an old
lady?

578
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,320
When I get around to it.

579
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:28,241
You got something else on the
side?

580
00:39:29,409 --> 00:39:31,411
Nothing regular.

581
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,871
<i>She </i>got something else
on the side?

582
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,206
No.

583
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,958
You sure?

584
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:38,793
Yeah, I'm sure.

585
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:42,380
I don't know what you're doing.

586
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,049
Remember Jimmy McElwain

587
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:46,217
on the yard used to say,

588
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:48,219
"you want to make moves on the
street,

589
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,679
have no attachments.

590
00:39:49,679 --> 00:39:51,681
Allow nothing to be in your
life that

591
00:39:51,681 --> 00:39:53,975
you cannot walk out on in 30
seconds flat.

592
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,603
if you spot the heat around the
corner."

593
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,730
You remember that?

594
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:08,448
For me, the sun rises and
sets with her, man.

595
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,992
Yeah?

596
00:40:10,992 --> 00:40:12,785
Yeah.

597
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:16,831
Okay.

598
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:24,255
Today, we take delivery of
cash from Van Zant.

599
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,925
Then I drop a deposit on
Kelso for this bank.

600
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,636
Bank? What bank?

601
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:32,680
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

602
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,641
That goes, too. Then the bank.

603
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,187
Want some breakfast?

604
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:40,438
Yeah.

605
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,905
Are you okay?

606
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,823
Yeah, sugar.

607
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:58,039
Yeah. For real.

608
00:40:58,039 --> 00:40:59,332
Okay

609
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:00,458
Going to do good.

610
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,085
I'll see you later.

611
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:11,386
(engine starting)

612
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,935
You Solenko?

613
00:41:18,935 --> 00:41:20,019
I'm Don Breedan.

614
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:21,771
Grierson, my parole officer,

615
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:23,231
told me to come by here.

616
00:41:23,231 --> 00:41:25,358
Said you had a job for me.

617
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,735
You're familiar with this kind
of operation, huh?

618
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,404
Yeah, man. I'm a great grill
man.

619
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:30,697
Good. Good for you.

620
00:41:30,697 --> 00:41:32,490
Here, you'll mop out toilets,

621
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,534
Hit the dishwasher, bus tables,
and empty the garbage too.

622
00:41:34,534 --> 00:41:36,744
Give me a hard time,
i'll report you

623
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:37,912
loaded, drunk, or stealing.

624
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,998
And I'll violate you back so
fast, your head will spin.

625
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:44,001
25% of your take-home kicks back
to me.

626
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,211
Rules of the game.

627
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,963
Call Grierson. Check it out.

628
00:41:46,963 --> 00:41:48,464
Change in the back.

629
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,638
Well, what are you waiting for?

630
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,528
(phone dialing)

631
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:16,617
WOMAN:<i> Malibu Equity and
Investments.</i>

632
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,327
Yeah. Roger Van Zant.

00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:20,037
<i>Please hold.</i>

634
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,918
VAN ZANT:<i> Yeah, this is Roger
Van Zant.</i>

635
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,503
I'm supposed to collect
something?

636
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:28,629
Give me your number.

637
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:30,631
Somebody will call you right
back

638
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,383
From a different line.

639
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:35,595
(818) 133-6089.

640
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,606
(woman speaking Spanish)

641
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,369
(telephone rings)

642
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,204
Yeah.

643
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,205
MAN:<i> I got a package for you.</i>

<i>There's a drive-in on Centinela.
2:30 tomorrow.</i>

645
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,460
Okay just send one man alone.

646
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:27,146
(knock knock)

647
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:34,111
Who was that guy?

648
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,488
Nobody.

649
00:43:35,488 --> 00:43:37,281
Who--who was that guy?

650
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,574
He's nobody.

651
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:40,409
I got to know who he is.
Who is he?

652
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:41,994
-He's nobody, Neil.
-Listen, you!

653
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,579
He's a legit liquor wholesaler

654
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,456
From Las Vegas-- Alan Marciano.

655
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,708
Chris will straighten it
up with you.

656
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:48,626
It's too late! I'm sick of it!

657
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,627
Shut up!

658
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,713
Here's the deal.

659
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:55,383
You will give Chris one last
shot.

660
00:43:55,383 --> 00:43:56,843
After that, he fucks up,

661
00:43:56,843 --> 00:43:59,387
then I will finance setting you
up myself

662
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,389
on my own, anywhere you want.

663
00:44:01,389 --> 00:44:02,640
Dominick will go with you,

664
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,392
and my word counts,

665
00:44:04,392 --> 00:44:05,726
but right now,

666
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:09,021
you will give him the chance.

667
00:44:12,233 --> 00:44:14,569
Clean up. Go home.

668
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:17,154
Clean up. Go home.

669
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,619
Give me all your money.

670
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:07,079
One day you'll get smoked with
that shit.

671
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:08,539
Oh, won't be you, fool.

672
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,210
MAN: He's coming in alone.
Send him through.

673
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,921
Yeah, got it.

674
00:45:14,921 --> 00:45:21,969
(hip hop music playing)

675
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,829
Vincent! Hey, man!

676
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,164
Hey! Vincent.

677
00:45:50,164 --> 00:45:52,041
Hey, Vincent, this s my brother
Richard. Richard, Vincent.

678
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:54,710
-Richard.
-Yeah. It's all right.

679
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:56,879
What do you got for me?

680
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,172
Before we even get into that,

681
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:00,132
There's this crew ripping rides

682
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,634
All along the beach areas.

683
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:02,969
All right?

684
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,137
Now, the back of a trim shop on
Irvine,

685
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:07,390
if somebody was to pay

686
00:46:07,390 --> 00:46:09,392
A little visit this weekend,

687
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:12,895
they might find 2 turbos and a
911 slope.

688
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,398
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition.

689
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,608
Yeah. I'm a good citizen.

690
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:19,151
I'm Donald Duck.

691
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:22,571
So, you got something to tell me
or what?

692
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,033
Check this out, cuz.

693
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:29,870
How do I know, if I tell you
what you need to know,

694
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:33,040
you'll do what the fuck I
need to get done?

695
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,210
Richard, man Hanna's straight
up. We do business all the time.

696
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:39,046
I ain't your cuz, you rat
motherfucker,

697
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:41,590
And you know because I say so...

698
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:44,927
After I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

699
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:47,471
Look here, man, you understand
what I'm saying?

700
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:49,724
I could get killed for telling
you this shit.

701
00:46:49,724 --> 00:46:52,184
You can get killed walking your
doggy!

702
00:46:52,184 --> 00:46:53,853
All right, man.

703
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:56,439
There's this cat I was locked
up with in Folsom.

704
00:46:56,439 --> 00:46:58,399
Did a couple-- two, three years.

705
00:46:58,399 --> 00:47:01,027
He got out, and I ran into him.

706
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,197
And so?

707
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,908
He's a big fiend for action.

708
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:11,787
Now if he'd have said nothing,
I’d have thought nothing,

709
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,998
but he goes on and on, running
down to me.

710
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:15,374
How he ain't been doing nothing

711
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,001
and nothing's been going on

712
00:47:17,001 --> 00:47:18,294
and all this other bullshit,

713
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:21,297
so right then and there I
know...

714
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:23,632
this cat's got something going
down.

715
00:47:30,765 --> 00:47:32,683
Pretty fucking great.

716
00:47:33,809 --> 00:47:36,854
Albert, what's wrong with you?

717
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,982
You drag me here, waste my time
like this.

718
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:43,611
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

719
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:44,779
That's right.

720
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:49,033
Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.

721
00:47:49,033 --> 00:47:51,535
What do you want for that— a
junior g-man badge?

722
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,787
You going to make the call

723
00:47:52,787 --> 00:47:54,747
on them porsches or what?

724
00:47:54,747 --> 00:47:57,708
Is he kidding me?

725
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:59,502
-Hey, I'm telling you, man.
-Vincent!

726
00:47:59,502 --> 00:48:01,253
This Slick is no motherfucking
joke, man.

727
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:02,296
You know what I'm saying?

728
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,297
He's double time--

729
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,091
Say what? Say what?

730
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:07,259
You said "Slick." what does that
mean?

731
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:10,471
Slick. That's what he calls
People--"Slick."

732
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:13,015
And tell me about him.

733
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:17,353
About 6 feet tall...

734
00:48:17,353 --> 00:48:19,105
a lot of jailhouse tats.

735
00:48:19,105 --> 00:48:21,899
Got a big-ass peacock right
here.

736
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,486
What's his name?

737
00:48:26,821 --> 00:48:28,572
Cherito.

738
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,991
Michael Cherito.

739
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,372

<i>Jacket's 2 inches thick.</i>

745

Okay who do I have there now?

00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,263
Drucker and me, boss, and
Schwartz.

747
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,514
Tell S.I.S. I want full
surveillance.

748

<i>I want pictures of who he
moves and sits with.</i>

753
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,611
Then you guys run makes on

754
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:08,779
They got jackets, I want to
see

00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,698
Who they move and sit with.

Put your hands where I can see

What?

760

Take the package and throw it in

Yeah. Who's this?

771
00:52:07,875 --> 00:52:09,918
You know who this is.

772
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:12,212
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

773
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,340
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the
package.</i>

774
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:17,343
He didn't call. Is everything
right?

775

<i>I tell you what-- forget the
money.</i>

What?

777
00:52:22,056 --> 00:52:24,850
Forget the money.

778
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:27,019
Well, it's a lot of money.

779
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,520
What are you doing?

780
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,481
What do you mean, forget the
money?

781
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:31,774
What am I doing?

782
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,734
I'm talking to an empty
telephone.

783
00:52:33,734 --> 00:52:35,319
I don't understand.

784
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,820
Because there's a dead man

785
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:39,323
on the other end of this fucking
line.

786

-Ha ha ha!
-That's really good.

791
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,270
Did you know about this?

00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,774
You are insane.

-This thing is beautiflul.
-Yeah, It's beautiful.

795
00:53:21,407 --> 00:53:22,449
Just don't ask him
where he got it.

796
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,784
Yeah, that's right.

thought.

She doesn't know, just like me.

802
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,344
I don't know either.

Hello.

Hi. It's me.

807
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,949
Hey. I was wondering if you'd
call.

808
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:08,287
I been busy. Can I see you?

809
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:11,081
I was afraid that was just...

810
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,667
the one night, you know.

811
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:15,961
No, not for me it wasn't.

812
00:54:17,713 --> 00:54:19,965
Yeah, me, neither.

813
00:54:21,842 --> 00:54:24,303
Can I fall by?

814
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:26,096
Yeah.

815
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,515
Okay I'll see you in a little
bit.

816

825
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:59,171
The blond one is Chris

00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,179
the precious metals depository

830
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,472
three times.

831
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:12,017
Platinum, silver, and some
bullion.

832
00:55:12,017 --> 00:55:14,561
Sammy and I think that's going
to be their next score.

833
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:15,896
Who's the loner?

834
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,984
First time we're seeing him.

835
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,194
We're not on him yet.

836
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,906
Well, get on it.

837
00:55:35,499 --> 00:55:37,167
Okay.

838
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:47,302
When these guys walk out the
door

839
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:50,055
of whatever score they're
going to take next,

840
00:55:50,055 --> 00:55:53,934
they're going to have the
surprise of a lifetime.

841
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,285
Hey, baby, time to go.

842
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:15,747
WAINGRO: Showed you a good
time, didn't I?

843
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,291
Oh, yeah.

844
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,168
You fly.

845
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,087
You cool.

846
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,304
You're lying to me.

847
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,555
I can always tell

848
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,348
When people lie to me.

849
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,350
Hon, I ain't lying.

850
00:56:35,350 --> 00:56:37,477
You a hot dog...

851
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:40,230
A regular rodeo rider,

852
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:44,109
and this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

853
00:56:44,109 --> 00:56:45,777
Ha ha ha!

854
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:50,198
Now I got to get my ass
streetside, sugar.

855
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:53,285
You don't have a truth-telling
style.

856
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,203
What are you talking about?

857
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:57,497
You don't know what this is.

858
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:06,340
The Grim Reaper's visiting with
you.

859
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,644
Ugh!

860
00:57:19,061 --> 00:57:24,816
(music playing)

861
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:26,318
So where you been?

862
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:32,366
S.H.U. at Pelican Bay and
Folsom, "B" wing.

863
00:57:32,366 --> 00:57:36,620
I am a cowboy... looking for
anything heavy.

864
00:57:36,620 --> 00:57:39,373
Billy Ricketts said come see
you.

865
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:41,833
That is why I am here.

866
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,634
Why don't you--

867
00:57:50,634 --> 00:57:54,596
Why don't you call this guy?

868
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,848
This guy's always putting guys
on.

869
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:03,188
Thank you, brotha.

870
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,773
-MAN: I buy you a drink?
-LADY: Buy me a drink.

871
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,775
(background chatter)

872
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:11,238
Ha ha ha!

873
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,073
WOMAN: What's so funny?

874
00:58:13,073 --> 00:58:14,408
It's really dumb.

875
00:58:14,408 --> 00:58:16,201
You smell pretty.

876
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:19,121
You two are perfect for each
other.

877
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:20,664
How did you meet?

878
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,253
I knew this guy in grade school.

879
00:58:26,253 --> 00:58:28,255
His name was Raoul... whatever.

880
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,298
Anyway, he could take his
fingers, right

881
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,467
and fold them over-- one over
the other,

882
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,095
And then he'd turn his
eyelids inside out--

883
00:58:35,095 --> 00:58:37,055
I can't keep my hands off you,

884
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,640
and that's the truth.

885
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,767
That's what's so wonderful about
you

886
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,854
In that... bestial sort of way.

887
00:58:48,150 --> 00:58:49,651
Woman.

888
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:52,988
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

889
00:58:52,988 --> 00:58:54,239
(pager beeping)

890
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:55,741
Oh...

891
00:58:55,741 --> 00:58:58,493
This better be earth-shattering.

892
00:59:01,288 --> 00:59:02,289
(sighs)

893
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,126
So she tells him, "this is to
Raoul."

894
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:07,085
Raoul.

895
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:08,545
To Raoul.

896
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,338
Yeah. Vincent Hanna.

897
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,936
(siren blaring)

898
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,158
(helicopter flies above)

899
00:59:52,172 --> 00:59:54,591
Here's how we found her.

900
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,513
How old?

901
00:59:59,513 --> 01:00:03,266
16, 17. Been here about 6 hours.

902
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:04,643
How'd she die, Rachel?

903
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:07,395
Beat her head in, same as the
others.

904
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,064
Cerebral hematoma.

905
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,399
Who did this?

906
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:12,984
VINCENT: Who's that?

907
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,486
Mother and siblings.
I guess.

908
01:00:14,486 --> 01:00:16,112
What are they doing here?

909
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,697
Because It's fucked up.

910
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:20,283
Somebody knew the girl and
called the family.

911
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,910
Okay let's go.

912
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:28,291
Nice.

913
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,502
When I run a dna check on the
semen,

914
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:33,088
my intuition says it's the same
guy,

915
01:00:33,088 --> 01:00:34,548
so it's a series...

916
01:00:34,548 --> 01:00:36,174
and ending up in your court.

917
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,009
Sheriff's homicide getting
anywhere on theirs?

918
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,010
Not yet.

919
01:00:40,512 --> 01:00:41,555
Get her.

920
01:00:41,555 --> 01:00:42,430
Get off me. Get off of me!

921
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:44,099
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

922
01:00:44,099 --> 01:00:45,475
Oh, my god.

923
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:46,518
Whoa, whoa.

924
01:00:46,518 --> 01:00:48,937
Oh, my god!

925
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,146
Easy, easy.

926
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,356
Where is she?

927
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:54,276
Easy, easy, easy.

928
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,777
(sobbing)

929
01:00:56,570 --> 01:00:58,655
Okay it's okay.

930
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,576
It's okay it's okay.

931
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:04,494
Who did this?

932
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,037
Where's my baby?

933
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,706
Where is she?

934
01:01:07,706 --> 01:01:10,625
Oh, I need to know what
happened.

935
01:01:51,917 --> 01:01:55,003
I guess the Earth shattered.

936
01:01:55,003 --> 01:01:56,379
So why didn't you

937
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,466
let Bosko take you home?

938
01:01:59,466 --> 01:02:02,469
I didn't want to ruin their
night, too.

939
01:02:02,469 --> 01:02:04,220
What was it?

940
01:02:05,805 --> 01:02:07,807
You don't want to know.

941
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,769
I'd like to know what's behind that
grim look on your face.

942
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:14,022
I don't do that. You know it.
Let's go.  Come on.

943
01:02:14,022 --> 01:02:18,693
You never told me I'd be
excluded.

944
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,528
I told you when we hooked up,
baby,

945
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:23,239
That you were going to have to
share me

946
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:24,783
with all the bad people

947
01:02:24,783 --> 01:02:26,826
and ugly events on this planet.

948
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:31,456
And I bought into that
sharing... because I love you.

949
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:35,126
I love you fat, bald, money, no
money, driving a bus.

950
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:37,837
I don't care.

951
01:02:37,837 --> 01:02:40,298
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy

952
01:02:40,298 --> 01:02:41,841
Some of the time.
That's sharing.

953
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:44,177
This is not sharing. This is
leftovers.

954
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,514
I see. What I should do is
come home and say,

955
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:49,265
"Hi, honey. Guess what.

956
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,267
I walked into this house today

957
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,560
where this junkie asshole

958
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,313
just fried his baby in a
microwave

959
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:57,273
because it was crying too loud,

960
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,567
so let me share that with you.

961
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:00,902
Come on.

962
01:03:00,902 --> 01:03:03,196
Let's share that, and in
sharing it,

963
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,698
we'll somehow, uh,

964
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,200
cathartically dispel all
that heinous shit."

965
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:08,660
Right?

966
01:03:10,745 --> 01:03:13,331
Wrong. You know why?

967
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,333
Because you prefer the normal
routine.

968
01:03:15,333 --> 01:03:18,169
We fuck, then you lose
the power of speech.

969
01:03:18,169 --> 01:03:21,214
Because I got to hold on to my
angst.

970
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:23,508
I preserve it... because I need
it.

971
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:26,344
It keeps me sharp, on the edge,

972
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:28,138
where I got to be.

973
01:03:34,561 --> 01:03:37,355
You don't live with me.

974
01:03:39,024 --> 01:03:42,318
You live among the remains of
dead people.

975
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:49,159
You read the terrain.

976
01:03:49,159 --> 01:03:51,703
You search for signs of passing,

977
01:03:51,703 --> 01:03:54,289
for the scent of your prey,

978
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:56,458
and then you hunt them down.

979
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,962
That's the only thing you're
committed to.

980
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:07,177
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

981
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,183
What I don't understand

982
01:04:13,183 --> 01:04:15,852
Is why I can't cut loose of you.

983
01:04:30,742 --> 01:04:34,162
BREEDAN: Hey, it's Lilly.

984
01:04:34,162 --> 01:04:37,207
Let's go, baby.

985
01:04:39,334 --> 01:04:43,088
I met the manager.
Is that the boss?

986
01:04:43,088 --> 01:04:44,589
Did time

987
01:04:44,589 --> 01:04:46,257
for what that motherfucker does
everyday.

988
01:04:46,257 --> 01:04:48,676
Baby, can you just handle it

989
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:51,346
till we find you something new?

990
01:04:51,346 --> 01:04:55,141
Can you do that?

991
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,684
Ain't a hard time been invented

992
01:04:56,684 --> 01:04:58,186
that I cannot handle.

993
01:05:03,817 --> 01:05:06,694
What you hanging with me for,
Lilly?

994
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:09,989
Because I'm proud of you.

995
01:05:15,537 --> 01:05:17,163
You're proud of me?

996
01:05:17,163 --> 01:05:18,998
Mm-hmm.

997
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:24,796
What the hell you proud of me
for?

998
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,841
Come on home.

999
01:05:37,892 --> 01:05:40,145
NEIL: What were you doing
there?

1000
01:05:40,145 --> 01:05:44,274
I was skiing. I was trying to
ski.

1001
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,109
That's what people do there.

1002
01:05:46,109 --> 01:05:49,779
You go skiing, and you,
um... you meet people.

1003
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,115
You try to have a good time.

1004
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,074
Did you have a good time?

1005
01:05:53,074 --> 01:05:55,243
-No.
-Why not?

1006
01:05:55,243 --> 01:05:57,745
I'm not good at meeting people.

1007
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,873
You met me.

1008
01:05:59,873 --> 01:06:01,124
Well, that happened

1009
01:06:01,124 --> 01:06:02,792
without my thinking about it,

1010
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,919
which is why I probably...

1011
01:06:04,919 --> 01:06:07,589
No. It's because you are fine.

1012
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,801
Eady...

1013
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:15,805
Take off with me for a while.

1014
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,599
Where?

1015
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,267
New Zealand.

1016
01:06:19,267 --> 01:06:20,852
Ha ha ha!

1017
01:06:20,852 --> 01:06:22,770
When?

1018
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:24,105
I have to go separate.

1019
01:06:24,105 --> 01:06:25,815
You could meet me there.

1020
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,317
But my job, my--

1021
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,319
I got money. You don't need
money.

1022
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,822
You could set up a studio, do
work there.

1023
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,616
I don't know.

1024
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:35,992
What's there to know?

1025
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:38,244
Are you married?

1026
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,370
What?

1027
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:40,455
You come and go.

1028
01:06:40,455 --> 01:06:42,665
The last thing I am is married.

1029
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,960
I'm a needle starting at zero, going
the other way and double blank

1030
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,962
Then all of a sudden,

1031
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,632
someone like you comes along.

1032
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:55,386
You don't know me, Neil.

1033
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,971
I know enough.

1034
01:07:00,475 --> 01:07:02,310
Come with me.

1035
01:07:11,945 --> 01:07:14,739
What's wrong, baby?

1036
01:07:14,739 --> 01:07:18,785
Nothing's wrong. Everything's
right. Will you go?

1037
01:07:22,789 --> 01:07:24,499
Yeah.

1038
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,753
Good.

1039
01:07:53,695 --> 01:07:54,529
Hey, sweetie.

1040
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,572
Hi.

1041
01:07:56,572 --> 01:08:00,535
What happened? You forget your
mom was picking you up?

1042
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:01,995
No.

1043
01:08:03,538 --> 01:08:06,291
So, what's going on?

1044
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:09,877
I felt like being alone.

1045
01:08:11,004 --> 01:08:13,840
Okay come on. I'll drive you
home.

1046
01:08:16,009 --> 01:08:17,844
(engine starts)

1047
01:08:19,053 --> 01:08:20,722
Hey, Mike.

1048
01:08:20,722 --> 01:08:22,390
Hi, Lauren.

1049
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,774
What's happening?

1050
01:09:12,774 --> 01:09:14,484
Lieutenant, sir.

1051
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:17,362
Captain Jackson wants to
know what's going on.

1052
01:09:17,362 --> 01:09:21,282
Nothing's going on. Stay off the
air.

1053
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,757
Jackson.

1054
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:16,754
Technique.

1055
01:10:16,754 --> 01:10:17,672
Mm-hmm.

1056
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:33,729
(indistinct noise in
the distant)

1057
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:38,651
VINCENT: Open sesame. Right
there.

1058
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:05,928
(sounds of water drops)

1059
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:35,958
There.

1060
01:11:40,338 --> 01:11:42,590
(machinery whirring)

1061
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:00,775
(thump)

1062
01:12:26,092 --> 01:12:27,301
(drilling)

1063
01:12:39,188 --> 01:12:40,314
We walk.

1064
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:41,357
I'm right there.

1065
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:43,192
We walk now! Come on.

1066
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,360
(turns off drill)

1067
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:58,541
(whispering) He's heard it. He's
heard it.

1068
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,844
Heads up.

1069
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:11,137
One's coming out.

1070
01:13:11,137 --> 01:13:12,555
Just hold it, captain.

1071
01:13:12,555 --> 01:13:14,765
Vincent, he's not carrying
anything.

1072
01:13:14,765 --> 01:13:16,058
Yeah, I see.

1073
01:13:18,352 --> 01:13:20,104
Here we go.

1074
01:13:20,104 --> 01:13:21,814
Not till my boss says so.

1075
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:22,857
Vincent, both of them

1076
01:13:22,857 --> 01:13:25,151
are not carrying anything.

1077
01:13:32,575 --> 01:13:34,785
Okay let them go.

1078
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:37,079
JACKSON:<i> What do you mean, we
can take them on it!</i>

1079
01:13:37,079 --> 01:13:38,664
What, on what? What are
you going to take them
on?  Breaking and entering?

1080
01:13:38,664 --> 01:13:40,499
They didn't steal anything yet.
Don't you get it?

1081
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,169
It gets knocked back to some
chickenshit misdemeanor,

1082
01:13:43,169 --> 01:13:45,338
They do six months, and they're
out. No fuckin' way.

1083
01:13:45,338 --> 01:13:47,465
I'm not taking the heat from my
bosses because you let them go.

1084
01:13:47,465 --> 01:13:49,425
They're not walking.

1085
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:50,801
That's exactly what they are
going to do. They're going to walk

1086
01:13:50,801 --> 01:13:52,511
This is my operation.

1087
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,722
I have tactical command that
supersedes your rank.

1088
01:13:54,722 --> 01:13:57,642
They will walk away, and
you will let them.

1089
01:13:57,642 --> 01:13:58,643
Fuck!

1090
01:14:44,355 --> 01:14:45,564
Back to work.

1091
01:14:46,899 --> 01:14:49,151
L.A.P.D., gee, what?

1092
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:51,946
Where the fuck did this heat
come from?

1093
01:14:51,946 --> 01:14:54,990
Maybe it's the score they were
on to-- the place, not us.

1094
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:57,493
Because it's been hit a couple
times, you know or something.

1095
01:14:57,493 --> 01:15:00,287
Assume they got our phones,
Assume they got our houses.

1096
01:15:00,287 --> 01:15:03,541
Assume they got us right here
right now as we sit.

1097
01:15:03,541 --> 01:15:05,042
Everything. Assume it all.

1098
01:15:05,042 --> 01:15:06,460
How will we buy the package from
Kelso?

1099
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:08,295
I'll front that.
That's not a problem.

1100
01:15:08,295 --> 01:15:11,173
Well, what the hell happens if
Van Zant and our 750?

1101
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:14,385
Van Zant. Listen, with the heat we
got you want to play World War II
in the streets with Van Zant?

1102
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:16,804
No, I want my 750. What, he gets
a pass?

1103
01:15:16,804 --> 01:15:18,222
I got more motivation

1104
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,724
To whack Van Zant than
either of you.

1105
01:15:19,724 --> 01:15:21,225
He's a fucking luxury.

1106
01:15:21,225 --> 01:15:23,978
Our problem is take the bank or
split right now.

1107
01:15:23,978 --> 01:15:26,313
Do not go home, Do not pack,
nothing.

1108
01:15:26,313 --> 01:15:27,690
30 seconds flat from now

1109
01:15:27,690 --> 01:15:30,276
We are gone on our separate
ways.

1110
01:15:30,276 --> 01:15:31,777
That's it. Chris.

1111
01:15:35,656 --> 01:15:37,950
The bank is worth the risk.

1112
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,786
I need it, brother.

1113
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:43,122
We should stay and take it down.

1114
01:15:43,122 --> 01:15:45,499
That's where I come out.

1115
01:15:55,259 --> 01:15:58,929
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.
Whatever.

1116
01:15:58,929 --> 01:16:00,014
Not on this one, Michael.

1117
01:16:00,014 --> 01:16:01,599
On this one, you're on your own.

1118
01:16:14,528 --> 01:16:15,780
You figure this

1119
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:17,782
is the best thing to do?

1120
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:19,492
This is best thing to do?

1121
01:16:19,492 --> 01:16:21,827
I got plans.  I'm going away
after this, so for me,

1122
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,954
the reward is maybe worth the
stretch.

1123
01:16:23,954 --> 01:16:25,790
But Elaine takes good care of
you.

1124
01:16:25,790 --> 01:16:26,999
and you got plenty put away.

1125
01:16:26,999 --> 01:16:28,626
You got t-bonds, real estate.

1126
01:16:28,626 --> 01:16:29,877
If I were you, I would be smart.

1127
01:16:29,877 --> 01:16:31,879
I would cut loose of this.

1128
01:16:49,313 --> 01:16:50,981
(laughs)

1129
01:16:50,981 --> 01:16:54,401
Well, you know, for me, the
action is the juice.

1130
01:16:54,401 --> 01:16:55,861
I'm in.

1131
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:01,408
<i>Tu?</i>

1132
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:04,829
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

1133
01:17:04,829 --> 01:17:06,789
MICHEAL: Fuck them! Let's do
it.

1134
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:09,416
Come on let's go, we got a lot
of work to do.

1135
01:17:13,671 --> 01:17:16,715
(machine whirring)

1136
01:17:21,971 --> 01:17:23,973
WOMAN: You can't go in there.

1137
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:24,974
VINCENT: Watch this.

1138
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:27,184
Excuse me, that--

1139
01:17:27,184 --> 01:17:28,769
-Uh, Tim, I gotta call you back.
-Wait, you have to have an appointment!

1140
01:17:28,769 --> 01:17:29,854
MARCIANO: May I help you?

1141
01:17:29,854 --> 01:17:31,021
VINCENT: Are you Alan Marciano?

1142
01:17:31,021 --> 01:17:32,857
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

1143
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:33,691
Who am I?

1144
01:17:33,691 --> 01:17:34,984
Hey! Hey!

1145
01:17:34,984 --> 01:17:37,152
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna,
L.A.P.D.

1146
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:41,198
L.A.-- This is Las Vegas. You
don't even have jurisdiction here!

1147
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,617
Hey, hey.  I don't know who the
fuck you guys think you're
pushing around.

1148
01:17:43,617 --> 01:17:45,244
But, I know people here, okay.

1149
01:17:45,244 --> 01:17:49,790
Las Vegas P.D. takes you into
custody.

1150
01:17:49,790 --> 01:17:51,709
You are extradited to Newark

1151
01:17:51,709 --> 01:17:53,043
On a New Jersey warrant

1152
01:17:53,043 --> 01:17:54,545
For smuggling cigarettes

1153
01:17:54,545 --> 01:17:56,714
up from North Carolina three
years ago,

1154
01:17:56,714 --> 01:17:58,924
or you go to work for us.

1155
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,511
Cut and dried. That is it.

1156
01:18:02,511 --> 01:18:03,929
Oh, shit.

1157
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:06,682
Charlene Shiherlis.

1158
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,017
Who?

1159
01:18:08,017 --> 01:18:10,019
"Who? Who?"

1160
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,687
What are you, a fucking owl?

1161
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,981
DRUCKER: The lady you've
been talking dirty to

1162
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,691
on the telephone last week.

1163
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,026
Yeah, alright. You know what,
you can't tie me to her.

1164
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,360
Who needs to?

1165
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:20,029
Because your ass is on a plane

1166
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:23,657
-Back to New Jersey, jack-off.
-All man, I just--

1167
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:25,200
Why'd I get mixed up with that
bitch?

1168
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:29,538
Because she got a... great ass,

1169
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:31,123
and you got your head...

1170
01:18:31,123 --> 01:18:33,459
all the way up it!

1171
01:18:33,459 --> 01:18:34,460
MARCIANO: Jesus.

1172
01:18:36,879 --> 01:18:38,631
When I think of asses--

1173
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:40,799
A woman's ass--

1174
01:18:40,799 --> 01:18:42,426
something comes out of me.

1175
01:18:44,303 --> 01:18:45,179
So?

1176
01:18:45,179 --> 01:18:46,889
So, no big thing.

1177
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:49,808
All I want... is her husband

1178
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:51,769
and his whole fucking crew.

1179
01:18:51,769 --> 01:18:54,730
Now, you're going to work with
Sergeant Drucker.

1180
01:18:58,692 --> 01:19:01,779
-San Clemente Road and Hermosa.
-Uh huh.

1181
01:19:01,779 --> 01:19:03,364
That's where we cut through the
fence.

1182
01:19:03,364 --> 01:19:05,032
That's the access.

1183
01:19:05,032 --> 01:19:07,826
Right. The security systems
around here are a joke.

1184
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,750
Saint Vincent Thomas Bridge.

1185
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:16,919
That's escape route number one.

1186
01:19:16,919 --> 01:19:20,506
Number 2, over here. Anaheim to
the 110.

1187
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,049
Good.

1188
01:19:22,049 --> 01:19:22,925
-Okay? Got it?
-Yeah, that's nice.

1189
01:19:22,925 --> 01:19:24,385
Good. Let's go.

1190
01:19:47,408 --> 01:19:49,284
They were looking back

1191
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:52,913
In this direction.

1192
01:19:52,913 --> 01:19:54,164
A container facility?

1193
01:19:54,164 --> 01:19:56,250
What? Cartage theft?

1194
01:19:56,250 --> 01:19:59,586
Too visible. Too lowball for
them.

1195
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,258
Next door's an oil refinery.

1196
01:20:04,258 --> 01:20:05,551
Over there's a scrap yard.

1197
01:20:05,551 --> 01:20:07,261
Refinery pays by check.

1198
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:08,345
No cash around.

1199
01:20:08,345 --> 01:20:10,431
Same for the scrap yard.

1200
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,186
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

1201
01:20:18,272 --> 01:20:22,109
A refinery and a scrap yard.

1202
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:24,403
What the hell is going on?

1203
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,405
That's what we're trying to
figure out.

1204
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:30,034
We thought we had it.

1205
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,410
Thought we had it.

1206
01:20:40,294 --> 01:20:43,172
I got an idea...

1207
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:46,175
on what they were looking at.

1208
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:50,971
You want to know what they're
looking at?

1209
01:20:50,971 --> 01:20:52,097
What?

1210
01:20:52,097 --> 01:20:54,391
I mean, is this guy something

1211
01:20:54,391 --> 01:20:57,311
or is he something?

1212
01:20:57,311 --> 01:21:01,273
This crew is good.

1213
01:21:01,273 --> 01:21:03,400
You know what they're looking
at?

1214
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,778
What?

1215
01:21:05,778 --> 01:21:08,697
Us.

1216
01:21:08,697 --> 01:21:14,161
The L.A.P.D. The police
department.

1217
01:21:14,161 --> 01:21:16,872
We just got made.

1218
01:21:23,962 --> 01:21:25,130
Yeah!

1219
01:21:33,514 --> 01:21:35,307
Okay.

1220
01:21:44,316 --> 01:21:46,360
Okay, motherfucker!

1221
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,423
Kelso come through?

1222
01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,343
Yeah. You can build a bank with
these.

1223
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:20,686
The name is Hanna. First name,
Vincent.

1224
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:23,272
I smeared this sergeant in
Vice five yards.

1225
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,440
Hanna's all over you,

1226
01:22:25,440 --> 01:22:26,817
It's all the work cars.

1227
01:22:26,817 --> 01:22:28,777
Michael's house, Shiherlis-- not
yours.

1228
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,529
They've been losing you at
night.

1229
01:22:30,529 --> 01:22:32,197
Hanna's a hot dog.

1230
01:22:32,197 --> 01:22:34,616
Graduate school, marine corps.

1231
01:22:34,616 --> 01:22:37,369
Lieutenant in Robbery/Homicide,
Major Crime Unit.

1232
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,370
He's taken down some heavy
crews.

1233
01:22:38,370 --> 01:22:40,497
Blew away Frankie Yonder in
Chicago,

1234
01:22:40,497 --> 01:22:43,375
And he was a fucking maniac.

1235
01:22:43,375 --> 01:22:45,502
He was working Narcotics before
that.

1236
01:22:45,502 --> 01:22:47,462
Had some problems. Divorced
twice.

1237
01:22:47,462 --> 01:22:48,630
Current wife's Justine.

1238
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,257
He's why the extra heat.

1239
01:22:52,593 --> 01:22:55,679
The vice sergeant...

1240
01:22:55,679 --> 01:22:58,265
says Hanna likes you.

1241
01:22:58,265 --> 01:23:00,017
Thinks you're some kind of star.

1242
01:23:00,017 --> 01:23:02,519
You do this sharp, you do that
sharp.

1243
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:05,731
Look how sharp this guy is to
figure that.

1244
01:23:05,731 --> 01:23:07,232
Ha ha!

1245
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:08,901
Funny as a heart attack.

1246
01:23:08,901 --> 01:23:09,735
Three marriages?

1247
01:23:09,735 --> 01:23:10,611
What do you think that means,

1248
01:23:10,611 --> 01:23:12,905
He likes staying home?

1249
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:15,616
He's one of those guys out
there...

1250
01:23:15,616 --> 01:23:17,659
prowling around all night,
dedicated.

1251
01:23:20,454 --> 01:23:23,749
With this guy, this much heat,
you should pass.

1252
01:23:30,297 --> 01:23:32,549
It's worth the stretch.

1253
01:23:32,549 --> 01:23:35,510
This guy can hit or miss.

1254
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:37,304
You can't miss once.

1255
01:23:37,304 --> 01:23:40,349
You sure?

1256
01:23:40,349 --> 01:23:42,226
I am sure.

1257
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,524
Let's go to the garage.

1258
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,623
Justine!

1259
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,421
Justine!

1260
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:19,304
Where are we going?

1261
01:24:24,518 --> 01:24:26,186
Okay where are<i> you </i>going?

1262
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:28,188
Out.

1263
01:25:25,662 --> 01:25:27,372
What are they on?

1264
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,541
PILOT: Tac 9.

1265
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:32,794
DETECTIVE:<i> They're northbound
out L.A.X. on the 405.</i>

1266
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,255
<i>We got four ground units and
air.</i>

1267
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:55,192
This is Hanna in Air 18. Who
have I got?

1268
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:57,986
RADIO:<i> Hey, Vincent this is
J.J. in Air 40.</i>

1269
01:25:57,986 --> 01:26:00,072
<i>Richard Glover's with me.</i>

1270
01:26:00,072 --> 01:26:01,990
<i>It's on the 105 eastbound</i>

1271
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,867
<i>Approaching the 110 interchange.</i>

1272
01:26:03,867 --> 01:26:05,952
VINCENT: You running a
revolving tail?

1273
01:26:05,952 --> 01:26:09,206
<i>Yeah. I got two units in
front, Three behind.</i>

1274
01:26:09,206 --> 01:26:11,083
Have one of them pick me up

1275
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,043
At the Vermont on-ramp.

1276
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:14,878
Let's go.

1277
01:26:15,128 --> 01:26:18,131
(music plays)

1278
01:27:04,136 --> 01:27:08,265
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I
close or far, what?

1279
01:27:08,265 --> 01:27:11,768
DETECTIVE:<i> 300 yards, center
lane.</i>

1280
01:27:19,526 --> 01:27:22,529
(music continues playing)

1281
01:28:09,201 --> 01:28:11,203
(music stops)

1282
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,503
How you doing?

1283
01:28:22,589 --> 01:28:23,798
What do you say

1284
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:26,760
I buy you a cup of coffee?

1285
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:33,934
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

1286
01:28:33,934 --> 01:28:35,936
Follow me.

1287
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:45,904
(car door closes)

1288
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:55,372
Seven years in Folsom. In
the hole for three.

1289
01:28:55,372 --> 01:28:57,666
McNeil Before that.

1290
01:29:00,502 --> 01:29:03,338
McNeil as tough as they say?

1291
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:06,383
You looking to become a
Penologist?

1292
01:29:06,383 --> 01:29:08,385
You looking to go back?

1293
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:10,762
You know, I chased down some
crews' guys

1294
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:12,639
just looking to fuck up, get
busted back.

1295
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:14,891
That you?

1296
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:18,270
You must have worked some
dipshit crews.

1297
01:29:18,270 --> 01:29:20,772
I worked all kinds.

1298
01:29:23,275 --> 01:29:25,569
You see me doing liquor store
holdups

1299
01:29:25,569 --> 01:29:28,822
with a "born to lose" tattoo on
my chest?

1300
01:29:28,822 --> 01:29:30,323
No, I do not.

1301
01:29:30,323 --> 01:29:31,825
Right.

1302
01:29:33,285 --> 01:29:35,287
I am never going back.

1303
01:29:36,621 --> 01:29:39,165
Then don't take down scores.

1304
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:42,377
I do what I do best. I take
scores.

1305
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:43,837
You do what you do best--

1306
01:29:43,837 --> 01:29:46,756
Try to stop guys like me.

1307
01:29:48,883 --> 01:29:52,178
So you never wanted a
regular-type life?

1308
01:29:52,178 --> 01:29:53,388
What the fuck is that?

1309
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:56,016
Barbecues and ball games?

1310
01:29:56,891 --> 01:29:58,226
Yeah.

1311
01:30:00,437 --> 01:30:03,315
This regular-type life-- that
your life?

1312
01:30:03,315 --> 01:30:05,191
My life? No. My life...

1313
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:08,820
No, my life's a disaster zone.

1314
01:30:10,196 --> 01:30:13,116
I got a stepdaughter so fucked
up...

1315
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:16,286
because her real father's this
large-type asshole.

1316
01:30:16,286 --> 01:30:18,038
I got a wife.

1317
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:19,623
We're passing each other

1318
01:30:19,623 --> 01:30:23,835
on the down slope of a
marriage-- my third--

1319
01:30:23,835 --> 01:30:26,087
Because I spend all my time

1320
01:30:26,087 --> 01:30:27,339
Chasing guys like you around the
block.

1321
01:30:27,339 --> 01:30:29,257
That's my life.

1322
01:30:35,263 --> 01:30:39,309
Guy told me one time...

1323
01:30:39,309 --> 01:30:40,852
Don't let yourself get
attached to anything

1324
01:30:40,852 --> 01:30:42,896
you are not willing to walk out
on

1325
01:30:42,896 --> 01:30:44,397
in 30 seconds flat

1326
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:47,484
if you feel the heat around the
corner.

1327
01:30:47,484 --> 01:30:49,486
Now, if you're on me

1328
01:30:49,486 --> 01:30:51,529
And you got to move when I move,

1329
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:54,741
How do you expect to keep...
a marriage?

1330
01:30:56,242 --> 01:30:59,412
Well, that's an interesting
point.

1331
01:30:59,412 --> 01:31:02,040
What are you, a monk?

1332
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:04,209
I have a woman.

1333
01:31:04,209 --> 01:31:06,211
What do you tell her?

1334
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:11,216
I tell her I'm a salesman.

1335
01:31:16,388 --> 01:31:19,641
So then, if you spot me coming
around that corner,

1336
01:31:19,641 --> 01:31:23,395
you're just going to walk
out on this woman...

1337
01:31:23,978 --> 01:31:26,648
not say good-bye?

1338
01:31:26,648 --> 01:31:28,650
That's the discipline.

1339
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,360
That's pretty vacant, no?

1340
01:31:30,360 --> 01:31:32,445
Yeah, it is what it is.

1341
01:31:32,445 --> 01:31:33,780
It's that, or we both

1342
01:31:33,780 --> 01:31:36,533
better go do something else,
pal.

1343
01:31:37,534 --> 01:31:39,494
I don't know how to do anything
else.

1344
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:42,247
Neither do I.

1345
01:31:44,374 --> 01:31:46,793
I don't much want to either.

1346
01:31:46,793 --> 01:31:48,837
Neither do I.

1347
01:31:55,510 --> 01:31:59,973
You know, I have this,
uh... recurring dream.

1348
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:01,933
I'm sitting at this big banquet
table,

1349
01:32:01,933 --> 01:32:03,435
And all the victims

1350
01:32:03,435 --> 01:32:05,520
Of all the murders I ever worked

1351
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,230
Are sitting at this table,

1352
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:11,484
And they're staring at me with
these black eyeballs

1353
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:14,237
because they got eightball
hemorrhages

1354
01:32:14,237 --> 01:32:16,030
from the head wounds.

1355
01:32:16,030 --> 01:32:20,326
And there they are, these
big balloon people,

1356
01:32:20,326 --> 01:32:21,870
because I found them

1357
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:23,496
two weeks after they'd been
under the bed.

1358
01:32:23,496 --> 01:32:26,332
The neighbors reported the
smell...

1359
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:28,835
and there they are,

1360
01:32:28,835 --> 01:32:31,296
all of them, just sitting there.

1361
01:32:32,964 --> 01:32:34,507
What do they say?

1362
01:32:36,009 --> 01:32:37,510
Nothing.

1363
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:39,012
No talk?

1364
01:32:39,012 --> 01:32:43,391
No. Just... they don't have
Anything to say.

1365
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:46,478
See, we just look at each other.

1366
01:32:46,478 --> 01:32:49,355
They look at me, and that's it.

1367
01:32:49,355 --> 01:32:50,857
That's the dream.

1368
01:32:50,857 --> 01:32:52,192
(snaps fingers)

1369
01:32:53,318 --> 01:32:56,654
I have one where I'm drowning,

1370
01:32:56,654 --> 01:32:58,531
and I got to wake up and start
breathing,

1371
01:32:58,531 --> 01:33:00,575
or I'll die in my sleep.

1372
01:33:01,868 --> 01:33:03,870
You know what that's about?

1373
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:08,124
Yeah. Having enough time.

1374
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:12,212
Enough time... to do what you
want to do?

1375
01:33:12,212 --> 01:33:13,463
That's right.

1376
01:33:15,673 --> 01:33:17,425
You doing it now?

1377
01:33:17,425 --> 01:33:18,885
No. Not yet.

1378
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:27,644
You know, we're sitting here...

1379
01:33:27,644 --> 01:33:30,146
You and I, like a couple of
regular fellows.

1380
01:33:30,146 --> 01:33:31,689
You do what you do,

1381
01:33:31,689 --> 01:33:34,567
I do what I got to do.

1382
01:33:35,151 --> 01:33:39,823
And now that we've been
face-to-face...

1383
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:43,368
If I'm there and I got to put
you away,

1384
01:33:43,368 --> 01:33:45,703
I won't like it.

1385
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:48,206
But I'll tell you...

1386
01:33:49,374 --> 01:33:52,377
If it's between you and some
poor bastard

1387
01:33:52,377 --> 01:33:55,922
whose wife you're going to
turn into a widow,

1388
01:33:55,922 --> 01:34:00,134
brother... You are going down.

1389
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:15,191
There's a flip side to that
coin.

1390
01:34:16,693 --> 01:34:19,070
What if you do got me boxed in,

1391
01:34:19,070 --> 01:34:21,990
And I got to put you down?

1392
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:23,908
Because no matter what,

1393
01:34:23,908 --> 01:34:26,911
You will not get in my way.

1394
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:30,915
We've been face-to-face, yeah.

1395
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:35,712
But I will not hesitate,

1396
01:34:35,712 --> 01:34:37,589
not for a second.

1397
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:45,471
Maybe that's the way it'll be...

1398
01:34:47,765 --> 01:34:50,518
or... who knows?

1399
01:34:50,518 --> 01:34:53,771
Or maybe we'll never see each
other again.

1400
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,539
They dumped us.

1401
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:13,458
What?

1402
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:14,959
They dumped us.

1403
01:35:14,959 --> 01:35:17,045
What do you mean, they dumped
us?

1404
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:18,546
Chris slipped his tail.

1405
01:35:18,546 --> 01:35:20,840
He doesn't talk about their
scores with Charlene,

1406
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:21,716
so there's nothing for me

1407
01:35:21,716 --> 01:35:24,093
to get from Marciano,
I just drive.

1408
01:35:24,093 --> 01:35:25,345
What about Cherito?

1409
01:35:25,345 --> 01:35:29,682
Same. Transponders got put on
a bus to San Clemente.

1410
01:35:31,476 --> 01:35:33,353
They dumped all our
surveillance?

1411
01:35:33,353 --> 01:35:36,814
Yeah. At the same time-- 9 p.m.

1412
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:40,276
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1413
01:35:40,276 --> 01:35:41,778
We were on you.

1414
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:43,112
Then McCauley drives into
L.A.X.,

1415
01:35:43,112 --> 01:35:44,614
where surveillance can't fly
over

1416
01:35:44,614 --> 01:35:46,616
because of flight paths.

1417
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:49,410
His car's still there. He's
gone.

1418
01:35:54,248 --> 01:35:56,334
Does anybody have any idea...

1419
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:59,420
where the fuck these people are?

1420
01:36:01,339 --> 01:36:03,716
(mechanical whirring)

1421
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:32,745
(crowbar falls)

1422
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:38,084
(electric screwdriver turning)

1423
01:36:39,335 --> 01:36:41,087
(screw falls)

1424
01:36:57,645 --> 01:36:59,897
MAN: you hear from him yet?

1425
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:01,441
Not a thing,

1426
01:37:01,441 --> 01:37:02,817
and not hearing bothers me more.

1427
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:04,902
Where's this guy?

1428
01:37:06,529 --> 01:37:08,031
This guy here.

1429
01:37:08,031 --> 01:37:11,325
We put him on. Says he knows
McCauley.

1430
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:18,416
Who are you?

1431
01:37:18,999 --> 01:37:22,795
Waingro... My name's Waingro.

1432
01:37:22,795 --> 01:37:24,672
I've been living in this office
day and night.

1433
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:27,425
How well do you know him?

1434
01:37:27,425 --> 01:37:30,636
Oh, we took some major scores
together.

1435
01:37:33,556 --> 01:37:35,433
How come I haven't heard from
him?

1436
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:38,394
Well, he's probably busy right
now,

1437
01:37:38,394 --> 01:37:40,480
But he's real thorough.

1438
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:44,233
He ain't going to forget about
you.

1439
01:37:44,233 --> 01:37:46,778
Oh, that's reassuring.

1440
01:37:46,778 --> 01:37:50,406
Well, I got some moves I could
make here.

1441
01:37:50,406 --> 01:37:54,368
Probably be a big help to you.

1442
01:38:14,472 --> 01:38:17,725
You recognize the grill man?

1443
01:38:23,856 --> 01:38:25,399
No.

1444
01:38:25,399 --> 01:38:28,236
Folsom. "D" block. Housed with
Dobie Rush.

1445
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:31,864
BREEDAN: I ain't got my break
yet, man.

1446
01:38:31,864 --> 01:38:33,866
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1447
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:36,869
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the
back.

1448
01:38:36,869 --> 01:38:38,621
Take your break later.

1449
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:40,164
Piece of shit.

1450
01:38:40,164 --> 01:38:41,624
Pick up!

1451
01:38:44,877 --> 01:38:46,796
Where the hell is he?

1452
01:38:46,796 --> 01:38:48,047
I want to check the slot

1453
01:38:48,047 --> 01:38:49,090
for the work car.

1454
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:50,299
So did I.

1455
01:38:53,010 --> 01:38:55,596
(cellular telephone rings)

1456
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:56,597
Yeah?

1457
01:38:58,391 --> 01:39:00,309
Hang on.

1458
01:39:00,309 --> 01:39:01,644
Yeah?

1459
01:39:01,644 --> 01:39:03,646
Hey. Use the land line.

1460
01:39:03,646 --> 01:39:07,483
Call me at 103-7206.

1461
01:39:07,483 --> 01:39:08,943
All right.

1462
01:39:18,035 --> 01:39:19,412
(telephone rings)

1463
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:21,330
Where are you?

1464
01:39:21,330 --> 01:39:23,916
There's cops all over me man.
There on me like a cheap suit.

1465
01:39:23,916 --> 01:39:26,043
I can't dump them.

1466
01:39:27,086 --> 01:39:30,006
They hip to the fact you spotted
them?

1467
01:39:30,006 --> 01:39:32,508
No. No, they're doing parallels.

1468
01:39:34,427 --> 01:39:36,721
I can try to dump them again.

1469
01:39:36,721 --> 01:39:38,973
How will we know if you did?

1470
01:39:38,973 --> 01:39:41,225
If you didn't, you'll draw them
to us.

1471
01:39:41,225 --> 01:39:43,644
Head for Ventura. Pull them out
of here.

1472
01:39:43,644 --> 01:39:45,396
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man.

1473
01:39:45,396 --> 01:39:47,857
Last thing I want to
is let you down.

1474
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:12,089
(man speaking Spanish)

1475
01:40:13,299 --> 01:40:14,759
Pick up.

1476
01:40:15,968 --> 01:40:18,095
Hey! Neil, man, what up?

Can he rest for a while?

1641
01:55:03,647 --> 01:55:05,148
Six, seven hours.

1642
01:55:05,148 --> 01:55:06,108
That's it?

1643
01:55:06,108 --> 01:55:07,275
That's it.

1644
01:55:07,275 --> 01:55:08,902
Take off your shirt.

1645
01:55:08,902 --> 01:55:09,903
What?

1646
01:55:11,696 --> 01:55:13,198
Take off your shirt.

1647
01:55:19,121 --> 01:55:22,165
My-- Look... my daughter

1648
01:55:22,165 --> 01:55:23,625
Gave it to me as a father's
day--

1649
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:26,878
I don't give a shit. Take it
off.

1650
01:55:31,174 --> 01:55:34,136
Chris... hey.

1651
01:55:35,720 --> 01:55:38,014
Chris, listen to me.

1652
01:55:38,014 --> 01:55:39,516
Mmm.

1653
01:55:39,516 --> 01:55:41,226
Nate's going to pick you up.

1654
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:43,645
He's going to take you to his
place.

1655
01:55:43,645 --> 01:55:45,522
Where's Charlene?

1656
01:55:45,522 --> 01:55:47,357
We got to get out of here.

1657
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:50,694
We're all over the 6:00 news.
We got to get out of here.

1658
01:55:50,694 --> 01:55:52,654
I'm not going without her.

1659
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:54,573
Think about that.

1660
01:55:54,573 --> 01:55:56,825
I will meet you at Nate's.

1661
01:55:56,825 --> 01:55:58,160
Where are you going?

1662
01:55:58,160 --> 01:55:59,828
I got to find out if our out got
spilled

1663
01:55:59,828 --> 01:56:01,955
Along with every other damn
thing.

1664
01:56:01,955 --> 01:56:04,791
Who did it?

1665
01:56:04,791 --> 01:56:07,002
Who wasn't there?

1666
01:56:07,002 --> 01:56:09,212
Trejo.

1667
01:56:12,465 --> 01:56:14,467
I'll see you at Nate's.

1668
01:56:20,140 --> 01:56:21,183
MARCIANO:<i> Yeah.</i>

1669
01:56:21,183 --> 01:56:23,768
Yeah. You still want me?

1670
01:56:23,768 --> 01:56:25,145
You come down here right now,

1671
01:56:25,145 --> 01:56:27,731
and you get Dominick and me.
Okay?

1672
01:56:27,731 --> 01:56:29,858
<i>Okay, baby, okay</i>

1673
01:56:29,858 --> 01:56:30,984
<i>I'll be there in two hours.</i>

1674
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:33,195
<i>All right? Okay?</i>

1675
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:36,156
All right.

1676
01:56:36,156 --> 01:56:40,076
-(baby cries)
-Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.

1677
01:56:40,076 --> 01:56:42,621
You're on a plane for Los
Angeles.

1678
01:56:42,621 --> 01:56:43,622
Right.

1679
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:35,590
Why'd you do it? What happened?

1680
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:36,424
They made me.

1681
01:57:36,424 --> 01:57:37,550
Who?

1682
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:38,885
Where's Anna?

1683
01:57:40,220 --> 01:57:41,513
She's dead.

1684
01:57:41,513 --> 01:57:43,598
Ohh...

1685
01:57:43,598 --> 01:57:45,517
So is Michael and Breedan,

1686
01:57:45,517 --> 01:57:47,769
The guy who stood in for you.

1687
01:57:47,769 --> 01:57:50,021
Who did it? Who did it?

1688
01:57:50,021 --> 01:57:51,523
They had Anna, man.

1689
01:57:51,523 --> 01:57:53,149
Who had her?

1690
01:57:54,526 --> 01:57:55,735
Waingro.

1691
01:57:55,735 --> 01:57:59,990
Waingro? On his own?

1692
01:58:02,075 --> 01:58:03,535
For someone.

1693
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:04,786
Who?

1694
01:58:04,786 --> 01:58:06,579
The other he worked for--

1695
01:58:06,579 --> 01:58:09,499
Van... Zant.

1696
01:58:12,043 --> 01:58:13,503
Van Zant?

1697
01:58:13,503 --> 01:58:17,590
Yeah... Van Zant.

1698
01:58:17,590 --> 01:58:20,093
Are you sure?

1699
01:58:20,093 --> 01:58:21,386
Van Zant.

1700
01:58:23,013 --> 01:58:25,890
Did you say anything about how
we're getting out?

1701
01:58:25,890 --> 01:58:28,059
I don't think so, Neil.

1702
01:58:28,059 --> 01:58:31,313
Come on.

1703
01:58:31,313 --> 01:58:33,315
I don't remember, Neil.

1704
01:58:38,570 --> 01:58:39,821
I'll call a medic.

1705
01:58:39,821 --> 01:58:42,115
I'm not going to make it.

1706
01:58:43,825 --> 01:58:46,286
I can't feel nothing.

1707
01:58:48,580 --> 01:58:50,165
My Anna's gone.

1708
01:58:52,542 --> 01:58:55,712
She's gone.

1709
01:58:55,712 --> 01:58:58,631
Don't leave me like this, Neil.

1710
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:00,675
Please, Homes.

1711
01:59:00,675 --> 01:59:03,803
Don't leave me like this.

1712
01:59:10,143 --> 01:59:10,977
(gunshot)

1713
01:59:20,612 --> 01:59:22,155
(dialing telephone)

1714
01:59:23,615 --> 01:59:25,617
(telephone rings)

1715
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:28,495
Yeah.

1716
01:59:28,495 --> 01:59:29,329
<i>Nate.</i>

1717
01:59:30,246 --> 01:59:33,541
You on a cellular? Use a hard
line.

1718
01:59:33,541 --> 01:59:35,251
It's a new one.

1719
01:59:36,503 --> 01:59:41,299
The guy lives on Hillside
Terrace, Encino, 10725.

1720
01:59:41,299 --> 01:59:43,843
<i>10725. Okay Chris?</i>

1721
01:59:43,843 --> 01:59:46,596
He's with me, my place.

1722
01:59:46,596 --> 01:59:49,140
Next--Waingro. okay?

1723
01:59:50,642 --> 01:59:52,310
You got the time?

1724
01:59:52,310 --> 01:59:53,895
I'll make time.

1725
01:59:53,895 --> 01:59:56,648
And I need a new out laid on.

1726
01:59:56,648 --> 01:59:59,859
How do you know it's blown?

1727
01:59:59,859 --> 02:00:01,486
How can I trust it?

1728
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:07,200
Okay, you got it.

1729
02:00:07,200 --> 02:00:08,660
Stay healthy.

1730
02:00:14,207 --> 02:00:16,042
Charlene Shiherlis.

1731
02:00:16,042 --> 02:00:19,546
Drucker's got a safe house in
Venice to stash her in.

1732
02:00:19,546 --> 02:00:21,089
On Neil's transportation.

1733
02:00:21,089 --> 02:00:22,966
When we're done here, get on the
phone.

1734
02:00:22,966 --> 02:00:25,218
Somewhere, someone's trying to
put It together for him.

1735
02:00:25,218 --> 02:00:27,762
You don't believe McCauley
already had a getaway laid on?

1736
02:00:27,762 --> 02:00:29,973
Sure, he did. Now he needs
another one.

1737
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:33,351
Would you trust yours after
this afternoon?

1738
02:00:33,351 --> 02:00:35,937
This rat motherfucker—
Where did we get him?

1739
02:00:35,937 --> 02:00:37,939
He's a C.I. for a burglary cop.

1740
02:00:37,939 --> 02:00:39,941
Called in the tip on the bank.

1741
02:00:39,941 --> 02:00:42,944
On Neil McCauley-- how much time
we got?

1742
02:00:42,944 --> 02:00:45,947
8, 10 hours for him to set up a
new out.

1743
02:00:45,947 --> 02:00:48,867
After that, he's gone. Bye-bye.
Bam!

1744
02:00:49,117 --> 02:00:50,034
(gun cocks)

1745
02:01:11,723 --> 02:01:13,224
(gunfire)

1746
02:01:21,733 --> 02:01:22,567
Uh!

1747
02:01:23,026 --> 02:01:23,860
Uh!

1748
02:01:36,164 --> 02:01:38,541
-(grunts)
-(sound of glass breaking)

1749
02:01:41,461 --> 02:01:43,546
You ratted McCauley to us.

1750
02:01:43,546 --> 02:01:46,257
How'd you know? Who told you?

1751
02:01:46,257 --> 02:01:49,344
Who told you, you rat
motherfucker?

1752
02:01:49,344 --> 02:01:50,345
Who?

1753
02:02:08,363 --> 02:02:10,365
(distant siren)

1754
02:02:18,998 --> 02:02:20,959
<i>CONLEY BACK IN FOR MURPHY.</i>

1755
02:02:20,959 --> 02:02:23,086
<i>NOW MURPHY WITH LEGGETT
RIGHT THERE WITH HIM.</i>

1756
02:02:23,086 --> 02:02:24,754
<i>MURPHY TEES IT UP...</i>

1757
02:02:28,466 --> 02:02:30,885
<i>FOR MILLER OUT FRONT. NOW
HERE'S MURPHY WITH...</i>

1758
02:02:35,139 --> 02:02:36,891
Waingro--where is he?

1759
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:38,935
Where is he?

1760
02:02:38,935 --> 02:02:40,562
How the hell would I know?

1761
02:03:05,878 --> 02:03:09,924
Well, what do we have here, huh?

1762
02:03:09,924 --> 02:03:13,177
Isn't this pretty? Isn't this
pretty?

1763
02:03:13,177 --> 02:03:14,304
Oh!

1764
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:17,181
Oh... you slimy piece of shit.

1765
02:03:17,181 --> 02:03:19,142
You told me you wanted out
from under, right?

1766
02:03:19,142 --> 02:03:21,144
You're scared to death, right?

1767
02:03:21,144 --> 02:03:22,729
You want out? This is out,
Charlene.

1768
02:03:22,729 --> 02:03:24,480
Yeah? What's your end?

1769
02:03:24,480 --> 02:03:26,482
I don't need no stupid broad.

1770
02:03:26,482 --> 02:03:27,775
How'd I get into this?

1771
02:03:27,775 --> 02:03:29,485
Hey, hey, hey, easy.
Huh?

1772
02:03:29,485 --> 02:03:32,530
You heard me.
She had a rough ride.

1773
02:03:32,530 --> 02:03:33,948
Fix her a drink or something.

1774
02:03:33,948 --> 02:03:35,867
Look in the cabinet above the
sink.

1775
02:03:35,867 --> 02:03:36,993
Fuck her.

1776
02:03:38,786 --> 02:03:41,956
You better get in there and stay
in there.

1777
02:03:44,751 --> 02:03:46,961
CHARLENE: Well, looky here.

1778
02:03:48,254 --> 02:03:50,798
My name is Sergeant Drucker,
L.A.P.D. Homicide.

1779
02:03:50,798 --> 02:03:52,675
You want to put Dominick in the
bedroom?

1780
02:03:52,675 --> 02:03:55,011
He stays with me.

1781
02:03:55,011 --> 02:03:56,596
There we go.

1782
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:06,522
So, what now?

1783
02:04:09,025 --> 02:04:10,526
Well, he's right.

1784
02:04:10,526 --> 02:04:12,528
Because you want out, this is
out.

1785
02:04:14,530 --> 02:04:17,033
You believe you have to betray
Chris?

1786
02:04:17,033 --> 02:04:18,576
No shit.

1787
02:04:18,576 --> 02:04:20,828
That's right. You would have to.

1788
02:04:20,828 --> 02:04:23,414
See, if you don't betray Chris,

1789
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:25,792
You victimize Dominick.

1790
02:04:25,792 --> 02:04:27,794
Because he becomes an orphan

1791
02:04:27,794 --> 02:04:30,338
when you go to prison as an
accessory.

1792
02:04:30,338 --> 02:04:32,465
You got no living parents to
take him,

1793
02:04:32,465 --> 02:04:33,925
so he ends up state-raised

1794
02:04:33,925 --> 02:04:36,511
In foster homes, juvenile
facilities.

1795
02:04:36,511 --> 02:04:38,930
Then he steals a car.

1796
02:04:38,930 --> 02:04:41,599
Then he winds up in gladiator
academies

1797
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:47,939
Like Chino and Tracy-- fucked
for life.

1798
02:04:47,939 --> 02:04:49,482
You know what happens...

1799
02:04:49,482 --> 02:04:51,984
because you've been there.

1800
02:04:51,984 --> 02:04:54,487
Dominick didn't get a chance yet

1801
02:04:54,487 --> 02:04:56,197
to choose his life,

1802
02:04:56,197 --> 02:04:58,991
but Chris did.

1803
02:04:58,991 --> 02:05:02,745
If you give up Chris, you get
off clean.

1804
02:05:02,745 --> 02:05:04,497
You can do it...

1805
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:08,000
for your kid, so you can raise
him.

1806
02:05:10,211 --> 02:05:12,213
What else are you selling?

1807
02:05:12,213 --> 02:05:13,756
All kinds of shit.

1808
02:05:13,756 --> 02:05:15,967
But I don't have to sell this,

1809
02:05:15,967 --> 02:05:17,552
and you know it,

1810
02:05:17,552 --> 02:05:20,012
because this kind of shit
here sells itself.

1811
02:05:22,014 --> 02:05:24,976
(dialing telephone)

1812
02:05:24,976 --> 02:05:26,728
(ring)

1813
02:05:26,728 --> 02:05:28,062
VINCENT:<i> Okay, Danny, here's an
update.</i>

1814
02:05:28,062 --> 02:05:29,647
Hey, Schwartz, Drucker's on line
two.

1815
02:05:29,647 --> 02:05:31,190
SCHWARTZ: Lieutenant,
hold on for a second.

1816
02:05:33,985 --> 02:05:36,154
Lieutent, I have Sergeant
Drucker on the other line.

1817
02:05:36,154 --> 02:05:38,072
All right, conference him in.

1818
02:05:39,073 --> 02:05:40,366
Go ahead.

1819
02:05:40,366 --> 02:05:42,452
Vincent, it's me.

1820
02:05:44,245 --> 02:05:47,415
One answer. What's it going to
be?

1821
02:05:53,796 --> 02:05:56,174
We're set here.
She'll make the call.

1822
02:05:56,174 --> 02:06:00,094
Okay, that's good. Here's the
deal here.

1823
02:06:00,094 --> 02:06:03,181
Hugh Benny has reformed his
wayward life

1824
02:06:03,181 --> 02:06:05,641
and become a born-again good
citizen.

1825
02:06:05,641 --> 02:06:07,894
Apparently, Neil got sold out to
us

1826
02:06:07,894 --> 02:06:10,730
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1827
02:06:10,730 --> 02:06:13,483
Waingro used to be a part of
Neil's crew.

1828
02:06:13,483 --> 02:06:15,151
Then he went to work for a money
launderer

1829
02:06:15,151 --> 02:06:17,737
named Van Zant.

1830
02:06:17,737 --> 02:06:20,740
Units are at Van Zant's house as
we speak

1831
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:22,909
because he got shot dead earlier
tonight.

1832
02:06:22,909 --> 02:06:25,745
<i>Now, if Neil goes after
anybody else,</i>

1833
02:06:25,745 --> 02:06:27,622
<i>It's going to be Waingro.</i>

1834
02:06:27,622 --> 02:06:28,706
Waingro just got himself

1835
02:06:28,706 --> 02:06:30,958
a suite at the airport Marquis

1836
02:06:30,958 --> 02:06:32,960
under the name Jamieson.

1837
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,045
He's there now.

1838
02:06:34,045 --> 02:06:37,340
I want you to get that to bail
bondsmen, bookies,

1839
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:41,052
<i>assignment officers, and
snitches in county,</i>

1840
02:06:41,052 --> 02:06:42,970
anyone who will put it on the
street.

1841
02:06:42,970 --> 02:06:44,972
Deploy a team down at the hotel

1842
02:06:44,972 --> 02:06:47,975
<i>I personally check their
coms every 30 minutes...</i>

1843
02:06:47,975 --> 02:06:50,478
because maybe Neil will go for
him.

1844
02:06:50,478 --> 02:06:51,896
Okay? How you feeling?

1845
02:06:51,896 --> 02:06:54,315
Banged up, but I'll live.

1846
02:06:54,315 --> 02:06:55,483
Okay.

1847
02:07:03,032 --> 02:07:05,034
He's here.

1848
02:07:05,034 --> 02:07:07,495
Neil is still here.

1849
02:07:07,495 --> 02:07:09,497
I can feel it.

1850
02:07:09,497 --> 02:07:11,666
But for how long?

1851
02:07:13,209 --> 02:07:15,670
Seven, eight hours max.

1852
02:07:24,595 --> 02:07:26,430
What did you do?

1853
02:07:26,430 --> 02:07:27,974
That was you?

1854
02:07:27,974 --> 02:07:31,018
It's what I don't do. I don't
sell metal.

1855
02:07:31,018 --> 02:07:32,937
Would have been okay, you fly
out after.

1856
02:07:32,937 --> 02:07:36,065
Now it's jammed. We got to go
together.

1857
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:39,527
Those other people were with
you?

1858
02:07:39,527 --> 02:07:42,071
My friend Michael... he knew the
risks.

1859
02:07:42,071 --> 02:07:45,032
He didn't have to be there.

1860
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:52,039
When it rains, you get wet.

1861
02:07:54,125 --> 02:07:56,043
Get packed. Let's go.

1862
02:08:02,466 --> 02:08:03,301
Eady!

1863
02:08:04,385 --> 02:08:05,219
Eady!

1864
02:08:15,313 --> 02:08:18,107
(crying) Why did you do this to
me?

1865
02:08:29,118 --> 02:08:30,703
It's going to be all right.

1866
02:08:30,703 --> 02:08:32,413
Do you understand that, baby?
It's going to be alright.

1867
02:08:37,084 --> 02:08:39,086
It's going to be all right.

1868
02:08:39,837 --> 02:08:40,671
Right.

1869
02:08:50,139 --> 02:08:51,724
There's a camaro at this
address,

1870
02:08:51,724 --> 02:08:53,601
level "D," slot 18.

1871
02:08:58,606 --> 02:09:00,149
Here's some cash.

1872
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:04,779
When's it over?

1873
02:09:07,615 --> 02:09:09,992
22 hours from now.

1874
02:09:09,992 --> 02:09:11,243
Then we get out of here clean.

1875
02:09:11,243 --> 02:09:14,080
When will you let me leave?

1876
02:09:17,333 --> 02:09:20,836
Go now. You want out? There's
the door.

1877
02:09:20,836 --> 02:09:23,297
Will you let me leave later?

1878
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:31,138
It will be different.

1879
02:09:31,138 --> 02:09:33,349
Do you even understand?

1880
02:10:04,130 --> 02:10:06,215
It's ready.

1881
02:10:06,215 --> 02:10:07,550
Vincent.

1882
02:10:13,305 --> 02:10:15,099
This is my friend Ralph.

1883
02:10:15,099 --> 02:10:17,977
Y-you didn't tell me you were--

1884
02:10:17,977 --> 02:10:20,646
Oh, my god.

1885
02:10:20,646 --> 02:10:22,189
Where's Lauren?

1886
02:10:22,189 --> 02:10:24,442
She's at Lisa-beth's.

1887
02:10:24,442 --> 02:10:26,152
Look, this has nothing to do with me.
I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry.

1888
02:10:26,152 --> 02:10:27,695
What are you sorry about?

1889
02:10:27,695 --> 02:10:29,071
Sit down.

1890
02:10:29,071 --> 02:10:30,740
JUSTINE: Don't you even get
angry?

1891
02:10:30,740 --> 02:10:32,700
I'm angry.

1892
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:33,826
Oh.

1893
02:10:33,826 --> 02:10:36,203
Yeah. I'm very angry... Ralph.

1894
02:10:36,203 --> 02:10:38,956
You know, you can ball my wife

1895
02:10:38,956 --> 02:10:41,459
If she wants you to.

1896
02:10:41,459 --> 02:10:45,254
You can lounge around here on
her sofa

1897
02:10:45,254 --> 02:10:49,216
in her ex-husband's dead-tech,

1898
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:51,844
postmodernistic, bullshit house

1899
02:10:51,844 --> 02:10:53,763
if you want to.

1900
02:10:55,097 --> 02:10:58,476
But you do not get to watch

1901
02:10:58,476 --> 02:11:01,979
My fucking television set!

1902
02:11:01,979 --> 02:11:03,981
JUSTINE: For god's sake.

1903
02:11:10,196 --> 02:11:11,655
Put the television set down.

1904
02:11:11,655 --> 02:11:13,199
I never cheated on you, bitch.

1905
02:11:13,199 --> 02:11:14,992
-Well, maybe you should have.
-I should have.

1906
02:11:14,992 --> 02:11:16,535
In a way you're a party to this.

1907
02:11:16,535 --> 02:11:17,995
Oh, yeah, I made Ralph fuck you

1908
02:11:17,995 --> 02:11:19,997
because it makes me feel good.

1909
02:11:19,997 --> 02:11:22,792
Our situation is absurd.

1910
02:11:22,792 --> 02:11:24,085
Uh, look, maybe I should--

1911
02:11:24,085 --> 02:11:26,879
Shut up! Ralph, sit down!

1912
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:32,760
Why do I have to figure things
out and explain to you?

1913
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:34,136
What do you do?

1914
02:11:34,136 --> 02:11:36,347
I say what I mean, and I do what
I say.

1915
02:11:36,347 --> 02:11:38,599
-Ha ha! How admirable.
-You bet.

1916
02:11:38,599 --> 02:11:40,726
Except none of it is about us.

1917
02:11:40,726 --> 02:11:43,395
No.

1918
02:11:43,395 --> 02:11:45,815
I may be stoned on grass and
prozac,

1919
02:11:45,815 --> 02:11:49,819
but you've been walking
Through our life dead.

1920
02:11:49,819 --> 02:11:52,321
And now I have to demean myself
with Ralph

1921
02:11:52,321 --> 02:11:55,116
just to get closure with you.

1922
02:12:07,294 --> 02:12:09,964
Passports, traveler's checks,
plastic.

1923
02:12:09,964 --> 02:12:14,885
The plane-- charter terminal,
L.A.X., Hangar 17.

1924
02:12:14,885 --> 02:12:17,304
Call letters are 10-11-Sierra.

1925
02:12:17,304 --> 02:12:19,306
(tires squeal)

1926
02:12:20,349 --> 02:12:21,684
Touches down,

1927
02:12:21,684 --> 02:12:24,353
Holds for you five minutes, then
splits.

1928
02:12:24,353 --> 02:12:26,355
The plane will stand an F.A.A.
check--

1929
02:12:26,355 --> 02:12:28,315
Filed flight plan, the works.

1930
02:12:29,441 --> 02:12:30,943
Hey, where's chris?

1931
02:12:30,943 --> 02:12:33,362
He's gone.

1932
02:12:33,362 --> 02:12:35,156
What?

1933
02:12:35,156 --> 02:12:36,198
Says he's going on his own.

1934
02:12:36,198 --> 02:12:37,366
Went to look for Charlene.

1935
02:12:37,366 --> 02:12:39,160
Didn't you bring him here?

1936
02:12:39,160 --> 02:12:40,953
Yeah, I brought him here.

1937
02:12:40,953 --> 02:12:42,997
What happened?

1938
02:12:42,997 --> 02:12:45,583
It's a free country, brother.

1939
02:12:49,879 --> 02:12:52,631
Check in with me at 9:00.

1940
02:12:52,631 --> 02:12:54,633
Everything's still cool.

1941
02:12:55,968 --> 02:12:56,969
All right.

1942
02:13:20,409 --> 02:13:23,662
I don't even know what I'm doing
anymore.

1943
02:13:25,956 --> 02:13:28,375
I know life is short.

1944
02:13:28,375 --> 02:13:31,295
Whatever time you get is luck.

1945
02:13:33,047 --> 02:13:35,341
You want to walk?

1946
02:13:37,885 --> 02:13:42,431
You walk right now... or on your
own--

1947
02:13:42,431 --> 02:13:46,685
On your own, you choose to come
with me.

1948
02:13:52,358 --> 02:13:54,610
All I know is...

1949
02:13:56,362 --> 02:13:58,364
All I know is, there's no point

1950
02:13:58,364 --> 02:14:00,366
in me going anywhere anymore...

1951
02:14:00,366 --> 02:14:02,785
if it's going to be alone...

1952
02:14:04,286 --> 02:14:05,829
without you.

1953
02:14:12,628 --> 02:14:13,462
Eady.

1954
02:14:29,144 --> 02:14:32,147
(music plays)

1955
02:15:01,593 --> 02:15:03,721
(beep)

1956
02:15:03,721 --> 02:15:04,805
Yeah.

1957
02:15:04,805 --> 02:15:07,016
Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1958
02:15:07,016 --> 02:15:09,351
Okay, I'll hold.

1959
02:15:11,520 --> 02:15:13,480
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1960
02:15:13,480 --> 02:15:15,441
Yeah. Do it.

1961
02:15:15,441 --> 02:15:16,442
Shut up!

1962
02:15:19,987 --> 02:15:23,449
Now, just one second at the

Let's get a doctor! Let's
Go--a doctor here!

There's your mama. Your mama's
here.

2039

Let's just calm down.

2040
02:24:06,263 --> 02:24:07,973
-Is she on any drugs?
-No.

2041
02:24:10,976 --> 02:24:13,520
Alright, I want you to get a trauma surgeon
down here and a vascular surgeon.

2042
02:24:13,520 --> 02:24:15,480
I think she cut both arteries.

2043
02:24:15,480 --> 02:24:17,482
Also I could hardly feel a
pulse.

2044
02:24:17,482 --> 02:24:19,234
Her pressure's way down.

2045
02:24:19,234 --> 02:24:21,194
So is her respiration. Intubate
her.

2046
02:24:21,194 --> 02:24:22,779
NURSE: It's ready.

2047
02:24:22,779 --> 02:24:26,241
When's the last time anybody saw
her?

2048
02:24:26,241 --> 02:24:27,492
I don't know.

2049
02:24:27,492 --> 02:24:29,077
Where did you find her?

2050
02:24:29,077 --> 02:24:29,911
Bathtub.

2051
02:24:30,537 --> 02:24:32,122
Call respiratory, stat.

2052
02:24:32,122 --> 02:24:33,957
Give her large-bore, normal
saline, wide-open.

2053
02:24:33,957 --> 02:24:35,750
Let's keep pressure on those
bleeders.

2054
02:24:35,750 --> 02:24:37,335
I need two units o-negative now.

2055
02:24:37,335 --> 02:24:39,004
Let's type and cross her for
six.

2056
02:24:39,004 --> 02:24:40,463
NURSE: Looks like she's in
some...

2057
02:24:40,463 --> 02:24:42,924
DOCTOR: Where is respiratory?
We need more help.

2058
02:24:42,924 --> 02:24:44,926
Can you have respiratory come
down now.

2059
02:24:44,926 --> 02:24:47,721
Have x-ray ready for
Post-intubation chest x-ray.

2060
02:24:52,517 --> 02:24:55,270
NURSE: Hi. Your daughter's
out of surgery,

2061
02:24:55,270 --> 02:24:57,397
and she's in the recovery room
now, okay?

2062
02:24:57,397 --> 02:24:59,941
Her vital signs are stable.

2063
02:24:59,941 --> 02:25:01,860
The surgeon will be out to speak
to you in a few moments and let
you know what's going on.

2064
02:25:01,860 --> 02:25:03,320
She's okay?

2065
02:25:03,320 --> 02:25:04,446
-She's doing good.
-She's going to be okay.

2066
02:25:04,446 --> 02:25:06,531
She's going to be okay, honey.

2067
02:25:06,531 --> 02:25:08,408
She's going to be okay it's all
right.

2068
02:25:08,408 --> 02:25:12,913
(crying) Oh, my baby. Why did
she do this to herself? Why?

2069
02:25:12,913 --> 02:25:16,416
Look what she did. Look what
she did to herself.

2070
02:25:16,416 --> 02:25:17,834
(sobbing)

2071
02:25:19,920 --> 02:25:22,923
It's alright, honey. It's going
to be all right.

2072
02:25:22,923 --> 02:25:25,133
I'm here. I ain't going
anywhere.

2073
02:25:25,133 --> 02:25:25,967
You understand?

2074
02:25:25,967 --> 02:25:26,801
Yeah.

2075
02:25:26,801 --> 02:25:28,219
I ain't going anywhere.

2076
02:25:33,433 --> 02:25:34,893

2078
02:25:41,691 --> 02:25:42,901
Yeah.

2079
02:25:42,901 --> 02:25:44,444
It's me.

2080
02:25:44,444 --> 02:25:47,322
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

2081
02:25:47,322 --> 02:25:49,741
On the driver's end, I still
can't find nobody,

2082
02:25:49,741 --> 02:25:52,243
so that's in the trust.

2083

<i>One other thing--</i>

2084

2085
02:25:56,456 --> 02:25:58,917
The guy you wanted checked
into the Hotel Marquis

2086
02:25:58,917 --> 02:26:01,378

<i>which I figured you wouldn't.</i>

2088
02:26:03,463 --> 02:26:05,548
You figured right.

2089
02:26:05,548 --> 02:26:08,593
So long, brother.

2090
02:26:08,593 --> 02:26:10,679
You take it easy.

2091
02:26:10,679 --> 02:26:11,888
You're home free.

2092
02:26:13,682 --> 02:26:16,142
Take it easy.

2093
02:26:26,903 --> 02:26:28,405
What is it?

2094
02:26:28,405 --> 02:26:31,199
Nothing. Home free.

2097
02:27:11,406 --> 02:27:12,449
Is there time?

2098
02:27:12,449 --> 02:27:14,409
There's time.

2099
02:27:43,146 --> 02:27:44,731
I'll be right back.

2100
02:27:44,731 --> 02:27:46,232
Just leave it running.

2101

Yeah. This is room service.

2103
02:28:30,318 --> 02:28:31,653
A Jamieson ordered a BLT,

2104
02:28:31,653 --> 02:28:33,530
And they screwed up his room
number.

2105
02:28:33,530 --> 02:28:35,865
Could you give it to me, please?

Waingro's not moving. I'm

02:30:47,372 --> 02:30:48,957
Do you want me to call him?

2121
02:30:48,957 --> 02:30:52,168
He's somewhere in the Sierra's.

2122

Oh.

02:30:54,170 --> 02:30:56,214
And she chose you.

2124
02:30:58,216 --> 02:31:00,218
She picked your place.

2125
02:31:01,928 --> 02:31:04,180
It's not right what happened to
her.

2126
02:31:04,180 --> 02:31:05,556
No, it's not.

2127
02:31:05,556 --> 02:31:07,183
(beeper goes off)

2128
02:31:10,228 --> 02:31:11,688
Oh, okay

2129
02:31:22,240 --> 02:31:24,242
Is there any way that...

2130
02:31:25,994 --> 02:31:28,663
it could work out between us?

2131
02:31:30,957 --> 02:31:34,210
I wish i could say yes, you
know.

2132
02:31:34,210 --> 02:31:36,713
But in the end...

2133
02:31:41,509 --> 02:31:43,761
You know, it's like you said...

2134
02:31:46,472 --> 02:31:50,727
"All I am... is what I'm going
after."

2135
02:31:57,984 --> 02:32:00,737
I'm not what you want, Justine.

2136
02:32:11,456 --> 02:32:14,375
Well, go on if you have to.

2137
02:32:14,375 --> 02:32:16,461
No. I'll stay.

2138
02:32:16,461 --> 02:32:19,922
No. I--I'm okay I can--I can
handle this.

2139
02:32:22,550 --> 02:32:24,552
Just be careful.

2140
02:32:24,552 --> 02:32:28,139
Call me here. Let me know you're
okay.

2141
02:32:28,139 --> 02:32:29,766
Okay?

2142
02:33:00,963 --> 02:33:02,840
(fire alarm ringing)

2143
02:33:12,141 --> 02:33:13,559
(knocks on door)

2144
02:33:27,031 --> 02:33:28,491
Yeah.

2145
02:33:30,118 --> 02:33:32,620
Security. There's a fire on
three.

2146
02:33:32,620 --> 02:33:34,789
We have to evacuate all floors.

2147
02:33:34,789 --> 02:33:36,624
I can't leave here.

2148
02:33:39,377 --> 02:33:41,879
(knocks on door)

2149
02:33:44,257 --> 02:33:48,553
Why don't we just talk about
this a bit, huh, brother?

2150
02:33:59,522 --> 02:34:00,523
Aah!

2151
02:34:00,523 --> 02:34:01,607
Uh!

2152
02:34:01,607 --> 02:34:04,235
He's here on 17.

2153
02:34:06,320 --> 02:34:09,240
Look at me. Look at me!

2154
02:34:12,243 --> 02:34:13,786
Look at me.

2155
02:34:19,834 --> 02:34:21,836
(gasping)

2156
02:34:26,257 --> 02:34:28,885
(sirens)

2157
02:34:45,276 --> 02:34:47,195
L.A.P.D. don't move.

2158
02:34:47,195 --> 02:34:49,030
Put your hands on your head now!

2159
02:35:05,296 --> 02:35:07,048
(sirens)

2160
02:35:07,048 --> 02:35:08,591
(horn honking)

2161
02:35:23,856 --> 02:35:26,317
VINCENT: Switch me to tac five.

2162
02:35:26,317 --> 02:35:29,362
<i>Casals? J.J.?</i>

2163
02:35:29,362 --> 02:35:31,364
<i>Drucker! J.J.!</i>

2164
02:35:31,364 --> 02:35:33,074
CASALS: <i>Vincent, I'm at the

2166

<i>the other three elevators,

2168
02:35:38,579 --> 02:35:40,331
<i>All out of commission because
of the fire alarm.</i>

2169
02:35:40,331 --> 02:35:42,333
<i>It's a mess-- people everywhere.</i>

2170
02:35:42,333 --> 02:35:43,793
Fine. 10-4.

2171
02:36:14,365 --> 02:36:16,367
POLICE OFFICER: Get out of the
way.

2172
02:36:16,367 --> 02:36:18,369
Get out of the way.

2173
02:36:18,369 --> 02:36:20,079
(shouting)

2174
02:36:59,285 --> 02:37:02,121
-(horn honking)
-MAN: Come on, let's go.

2175
02:38:07,645 --> 02:38:09,855
-Let me have that shot.
-Sure.

2176
02:38:27,164 --> 02:38:28,833
(airplane)

2177
02:40:18,859 --> 02:40:20,986
(click)

2178
02:44:28,108 --> 02:44:29,777
Told you I'm never going back.

2179

Yeah.
