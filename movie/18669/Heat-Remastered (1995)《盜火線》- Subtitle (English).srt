1
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,835
Check,
charge or cash?

2
00:03:31,003 --> 00:03:32,712
Cash. And, uh...

3
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:37,842
...make it out
to Jack's Demolition, Tucson.

4
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,469
Seven eighty-eight thirty.

5
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:50,980
Okay.

6
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,246
Hey.

7
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,123
Taking me to breakfast?

8
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,874
I can't, l'm meeting Bosko.

9
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:37,086
Hey, Vincent.

10
00:05:37,254 --> 00:05:39,338
Mom, where are my barrettes?
VINCENT: Hi, sweetie.

11
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:42,925
I saw them on the kitchen table.
They're not there. l already checked.

12
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:45,302
Want me to make coffee?
No school today?

13
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,723
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

14
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,100
Try under the cushions on the sofa.

15
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:55,896
He's already a half an hour late.

16
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:00,276
He gonna show? Or that son of a bitch
gonna stand her up like last time?

17
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:03,070
I'll make coffee.
I'm out of time, babe.

18
00:06:15,834 --> 00:06:18,753
Mom, where are my barrettes?
They're not in the couch.

19
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,380
Wear the blue ones.

20
00:06:21,548 --> 00:06:24,175
I don't wanna wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

21
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:27,011
Did you check in your bathroom?
I checked everywhere.

22
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:29,889
Well, what do you want me to do?
Find them.

23
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,975
Mom, pay attention.
All right, sweetie, all right. What?

24
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,102
Daddy's gonna be here.
Okay, he's gonna--

25
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,188
I'm not gonna be ready. l can't be late.

26
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,523
You won't be late.
No, I will be late.

27
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:42,651
Okay. Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

28
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,862
It's all right, baby. It's all right.
No.

29
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,655
It's all right. lt's all right.

30
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:49,742
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them together.

31
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,622
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. l promise you.

32
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,675
Hey. Give me another refill.

33
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,930
Now he wants a refill.

34
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,941
What's your name?
Waingro.

35
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,992
You're Michael, huh?

36
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:47,049
You guys always work together?

37
00:07:47,217 --> 00:07:48,884
All the time.

38
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:51,595
Real tight crew, huh?
Real tight.

39
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,559
Yeah, if this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

40
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,228
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

41
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:13,117
How's he doing?
A hundred percent.

42
00:08:13,285 --> 00:08:15,202
Right on schedule.

43
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:17,079
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

44
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,668
We're a mile and a half from you.
Okay.

45
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,777
Just crossed over the number-one lane,
300 yards from you now.

46
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:51,363
Get set.
I am.

47
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,656
Put that on.

48
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,624
Here we go.

49
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:05,187
Two eleven! Two eleven!
We're being held up!

50
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:13,279
DISPATCHER:
Two-eleven alarm. Armored car.

51
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,364
There's the call. Three minutes.

52
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,617
Clear!

53
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,058
Eighty seconds left!

54
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:28,103
Get back. Get back.

55
00:11:28,271 --> 00:11:29,688
Get back!

56
00:11:31,441 --> 00:11:34,068
Hey, Slick, you see that shit
coming out of their ears?

57
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,779
They can't fucking hear you. Cool it.

58
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,626
I got it.

59
00:11:50,794 --> 00:11:52,419
Got it.

60
00:11:55,048 --> 00:11:57,174
You had to fuck with me.

61
00:11:57,342 --> 00:11:59,093
You wanna fuck with me?

62
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,993
NEIL:
Come on! What the fuck are you doing?

63
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:26,745
What did you do?
WAlNGRO: l had to, man.

64
00:12:26,913 --> 00:12:29,081
Guy was making a move.
Let's go.

65
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,549
Dumb motherfucker.

66
00:13:08,538 --> 00:13:10,581
Step back, please, sir.
I heard them.

67
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,190
A million six.

68
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,234
Forty cents on the dollar,
640,000 to you.

69
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:41,778
Here's a 1 50 front money.

70
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,239
Get you the rest in two, three days.

71
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,576
Know who owned these?

72
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,081
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

73
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:57,252
Roger Van Zant.
Owns banks in the Caymans.

74
00:13:57,420 --> 00:14:00,923
Runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

75
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:04,426
So?
So you ripped off his bearer bonds.

76
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:06,762
He's got insurance.

77
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:09,765
That's the point. He collects
1 00 percent from the insurance.

78
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:13,769
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds
back from us for 60 percent of their value.

79
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:16,939
And make 40 percent
on top of the 1 00 percent.

80
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:22,736
Sell it back to him instead of going to
the street. That's an extra 320,000 to you.

81
00:14:22,904 --> 00:14:24,613
Try it on him.

82
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:27,157
Kelso called.
About what?

83
00:14:27,325 --> 00:14:29,910
A score he's putting out
and wants you to look at.

84
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,663
What do I need his score for?
I got my own.

85
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,957
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

86
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,126
Nine a.m. tomorrow.
What happened out there?

87
00:14:39,754 --> 00:14:41,505
Don't ask.

88
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,374
Find the ambulance?

89
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:21,086
Dumped it four blocks from here.
22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.

90
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:24,631
They torched it. Burned everything.
The guns, clothes, everything.

91
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:27,009
REPORTER:
Investigators are still working the scene....

92
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,428
They were airborne.
Taped the last few seconds...

93
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:31,847
...of the black-and-whites
doing demolition derby.

94
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,892
Stolen out of Fresno
two weeks ago.

95
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,687
Yellow pickup truck out of whittier
day before yesterday.

96
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:43,817
You taking this one, lieutenant,
or does it stay in Division?

97
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:47,863
This look like gangbangers
working the local 7-Eleven to you?

98
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,449
Robbery-Homicide's taking it. Yeah.
OFFICER: All yours.

99
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:54,119
We got three motorists. All they saw
were men with masks. They were distant.

100
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:58,206
Console TV man over there however,
he was closer.

101
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,334
He ID anybody?

102
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,545
Well, he was hiding. He heard it mostly.

103
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:07,382
VINCENT:
Okay. what about them?

104
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,219
HEINZ: Right. Now, according to TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

105
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,764
Smart.
Yeah, somebody called a guard "Slick."

106
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:15,390
Slick?
Yeah.

107
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:21,063
Now, this guy-- I figure this guy went
for that holdout piece, ankle holster, right?

108
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,648
From here.

109
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,484
Bang. Bang. Bang, bang, bang.

110
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,235
To his side.

111
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:32,282
This guy here has got what appears to be
a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

112
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,243
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

113
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:36,870
Probably executed.

114
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:43,085
And it was a million six in bearer bonds,
and they ignored the loose cash.

115
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,962
Because they had no time,
because they were on a clock.

116
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:48,924
Which means they knew
our response time to a 21 1 ...

117
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:52,302
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

118
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:54,888
...escaped in under three minutes.

119
00:16:55,056 --> 00:16:57,683
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

120
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:02,437
Two freeways within a quarter of a mile.
Traffic video camera?

121
00:17:02,605 --> 00:17:04,606
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

122
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,274
You recognize the M.O.?

123
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:09,194
M.O. is that they're good.

124
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,197
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef
for all of them...

125
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:15,450
...after they killed the first two guards,
they didn't hesitate...

126
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:19,496
...popped guard number three
because what difference does it make?

127
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,415
Why leave a living witness?

128
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:24,876
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock 'n' roll.

129
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,297
The shape charge.

130
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,218
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

131
00:17:33,386 --> 00:17:35,303
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

132
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:39,099
So let's start looking for recent
high-line burglaries that have mystified us.

133
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,435
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.

134
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:43,770
You're gonna get the phone book.
Do it anyway.

135
00:17:43,938 --> 00:17:46,940
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

136
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,652
Check the usual fences.
You and I will check Cusamano and Torena.

137
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,531
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.
Hang in with Forensics.

138
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:57,492
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

139
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,579
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

140
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:04,416
Get your hand out of that man's pocket,
Rachel.

141
00:18:04,584 --> 00:18:05,667
Oh, Vince.

142
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:14,968
Want some pie?

143
00:18:24,187 --> 00:18:26,271
TREJO:
Gotta go to the john.

144
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,722
Look, l had to get it on, man.
He was making a move. I had to get it on.

145
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:17,906
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

146
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,909
...to make up for his full end.

147
00:19:21,244 --> 00:19:24,579
Because I wanna pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

148
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:25,747
Okay.

149
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,037
MICHAEL:
Hold it!

150
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:42,759
CHRlS:
Hey.

151
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,847
Where's the rest?
We're late.

152
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:52,060
Ooh, you look too good to go out.
I could just jump you right here.

153
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:57,732
CHARLENE: Where is it?
Uh, squared the bookies, baby.

154
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,319
There's more in a couple days,
so don't sweat it. We really are late.

155
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:04,614
Yeah, come on,
you gotta be kidding me.

156
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,119
Honey, it ain't worth the risks you take
for 8000.

157
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:12,122
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

158
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,624
Let's go. Get your coat.

159
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:20,046
There is no point talking to you.
All you are is a child growing older.

160
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:21,548
What's that supposed to mean?

161
00:22:21,716 --> 00:22:25,885
It means we're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults, living our lives.

162
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,304
I'm married to a gambling junkie
who won't listen.

163
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,140
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

164
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:34,227
What am l doing
in this rat-bastard situation?

165
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:37,731
You're not! What do you want from me?
Leave the bankbook and car keys...

166
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:41,109
...in the kitchen on your way out.
Are we going, or am I going alone?

167
00:22:41,277 --> 00:22:43,778
You could keep that other crap
but Dominick would go with me.

168
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:47,490
Don't you even think about--

169
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,601
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

170
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:18,980
Albert Torena call Vincent?
No.

171
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,483
No. Report came in.

172
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,819
The explosive was Dynex,
linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

173
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,990
You can pick it up with a driver's license
in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

174
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:33,495
Too common to trace a sale, Vincent.
Oh, that's wonderful.

175
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:54,641
Are you all right?

176
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:57,352
What happened? Where you been?

177
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,686
Work.

178
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,148
Lauren's dad show up?

179
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:07,904
Didn't call, didn't show.
We waited for you till 1 0:30.

180
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:13,243
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with his kid?

181
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,830
I don't know.

182
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:18,873
Fucking jerk.

183
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,876
Well, is she okay?

184
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,879
She's been in her room all day.

185
00:24:25,047 --> 00:24:28,216
So no, she's not okay.
Neither am I.

186
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:33,638
Uh, I made dinner for us,
four hours ago. Um--

187
00:24:33,806 --> 00:24:38,852
Every time I try to maintain a
consistent mood between us, you withdraw.

188
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:45,567
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

189
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,402
I'm sorry...

190
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:51,739
...if the goddamn chicken...

191
00:24:52,074 --> 00:24:54,534
...got overcooked.

192
00:25:11,677 --> 00:25:14,554
--seven men in Denmark,
to a key defendant here.

193
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,268
WOMAN: Did you find it?
MAN: Not yet.

194
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,645
WOMAN:
There it is.

195
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:26,691
It's over here, somewhere.

196
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,616
WOMAN: Interior design?
MAN: lt's on the back wall.

197
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,259
WAlTER: Coffee, sir?
Please.

198
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:00,391
Will you pass the cream?

199
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,812
Thanks.
What did you get?

200
00:26:06,482 --> 00:26:07,899
What?

201
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,318
What are you reading?

202
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,991
Book about metals.

203
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:24,040
"Stress Fractures in Titanium."

204
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,960
What kind of work you do?

205
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:33,341
Lady, why are you so interested
in what l read or what l do?

206
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,514
I've seen you in the store
from time to time.

207
00:26:39,682 --> 00:26:41,099
What store?

208
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:43,142
Hennessey + lngalls. l work there.

209
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,978
Uh....

210
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:49,857
If you don't wanna talk to me, it's okay.
I'm sorry I bothered you.

211
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:03,746
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

212
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:08,376
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.
My name's Neil.

213
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,008
I'm Eady.

214
00:27:17,094 --> 00:27:19,178
You like working there?

215
00:27:20,514 --> 00:27:22,098
Sure.

216
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:25,476
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

217
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,687
What area's that?

218
00:27:27,855 --> 00:27:29,814
Graphic design.

219
00:27:30,232 --> 00:27:33,776
I do, um, letterheads
and logotypes at night...

220
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:36,779
...and the store's a day job
till I get enough going.

221
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,990
Who do you do that for?

222
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:43,411
Uh, a restaurant.

223
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,456
I did their menus, and, um...

224
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:50,877
...a small, uh, record label.

225
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:55,631
CDs. I've done two so far.

226
00:27:57,259 --> 00:27:59,385
You go to school for that?

227
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:00,970
Heh, yeah.

228
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,432
Yeah, l went to Parsons.
Where's that?

229
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,641
New York City.

230
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,144
How long you been out here?

231
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:11,272
About a year.

232
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:13,775
You like it?
Ha, ha.

233
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,987
Not really. l'm mostly here for the work.

234
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:27,372
Live in this neighborhood?
Ah, no...

235
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,458
...I live, um, kind of above Sunset Plaza.

236
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:34,128
It's actually kind of--
It's a little house that I rent.

237
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:38,800
And it's just kind of run-down,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

238
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:40,551
What about you?

239
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,305
I live up here.
That's very funny.

240
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,686
NEIL:
So where's your family from originally?

241
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:52,146
EADY:
Um....

242
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,899
I'm Scotch-Irish.

243
00:28:55,359 --> 00:29:01,531
They, um, emigrated to Appalachia
in the late 1 700s.

244
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,158
Where are you from?

245
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,494
The Bay Area.

246
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,288
Are your folks there?

247
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,003
Uh, my mother died a long time ago,
and my father, l don't know where he is.

248
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,713
Got a brother somewhere.

249
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:26,013
You have a tight family. l can tell.

250
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,015
Yep.
Right?

251
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,017
You're right.

252
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,734
Yeah....

253
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:41,487
City of lights.

254
00:29:44,408 --> 00:29:50,455
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae.
They come out once a year in the water.

255
00:29:50,956 --> 00:29:53,416
That's what it looks like out there.

256
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,419
You been there?

257
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,880
No, I'm going there someday.

258
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:01,340
Oh, yeah?

259
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,182
You travel a lot?

260
00:30:12,478 --> 00:30:15,313
Yeah.
Traveling makes you lonely?

261
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:24,614
I-- I'm alone. l am not lonely.

262
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,491
You?

263
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,410
I get lonely.

264
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,578
Albert!

265
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,540
Shit.
VINCENT: Albert.

266
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,667
Vincent, what you doing
coming here, man?

267
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,210
You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

268
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:48,007
You were supposed to get back to me
last night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

269
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:52,261
I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know.
Let's violate his ass right now.

270
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:56,557
I do for you, you don't do for me,
is that it?

271
00:32:57,267 --> 00:32:59,560
Vincent, man, l swear,
I was out all night, man.

272
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,063
I'm hitting like one of them
flamingo-matador guys.

273
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:04,357
Flamingo?
That's got nothing to do with me.

274
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,943
I was cutting it real smooth.
I'm generating leads and shit for you.

275
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:10,488
I'm a dancer, man. You know.
DRUCKER: Bullshit.

276
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,074
I paged your ass all day.
I can't stand paging.

277
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,826
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

278
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:18,913
Where is your empathy, brother?
It's a substance-abuse problem.

279
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,373
Empathy was yesterday.

280
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,500
Today you're wasting
my motherfucking time.

281
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:24,835
Vincent, man, look--
Did you fall in love?

282
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,422
Come on. Did you fall in love last night
and you went off somewhere?

283
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:30,925
Vincent--
Just tell me that. l'll settle for it.

284
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,761
I'll buy that.
Vincent.

285
00:33:33,929 --> 00:33:35,054
Give me all you got!

286
00:33:35,222 --> 00:33:37,223
Vincent--
Give me all you got!

287
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:41,227
I swear, man, my brother, man--
My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.

288
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:43,104
I heard "Richard"?

289
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,398
He's gonna talk to you.
Richard?

290
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,899
DRUCKER: Richard.
Richard.

291
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:50,111
He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight.
He's not here, is he?

292
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:53,614
No, he's gonna meet you tonight.
Tonight? what happened to now?

293
00:33:54,074 --> 00:33:57,576
I-- I-- l implored him
because l knew you was coming this a.m.

294
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,870
DRUCKER: This is a bunch of bullshit.
No, no, I swear.

295
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,748
He said no because he in Phoenix.

296
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,625
Ahh.
But this, man, l swear-- I swear, man--

297
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:06,377
By the time I get to Phoenix

298
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:09,130
He'll be risin'

299
00:34:09,965 --> 00:34:13,384
He'll probably leave a note
Right on the door

300
00:34:13,552 --> 00:34:15,761
ALBERT:
Tonight's the best l can do for you, man.

301
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:22,059
You know?
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...

302
00:34:22,352 --> 00:34:24,562
...at 2 a.m. Be there.

303
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,147
You be there too.

304
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:29,191
Vincent, l can't be there, man.
I got things to do, Vincent.

305
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:32,820
I got things to do, places to be. l got--
Hey, hey, hey.

306
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,156
Be there.

307
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,873
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

308
00:34:47,252 --> 00:34:48,878
What is it?

309
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:51,672
It's a bank.

310
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,134
It depos cash on Thursday
for distribution to all the other branches...

311
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:57,344
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

312
00:34:57,512 --> 00:35:00,681
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

313
00:35:00,849 --> 00:35:03,517
On the prowl or strong?
Strong. Through the front door.

314
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,519
How many guys?
Eh--

315
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:08,689
Four, or three plus a driver.
Walk in, knock them over, walk out.

316
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,232
And you want a 1 00,000 advance...

317
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,693
...against a 1 0-percent cut for that?
Uh-huh.

318
00:35:12,861 --> 00:35:16,155
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score.
They hit the holdup alarms...

319
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:19,033
...I gotta get out before the cops show.
What is that?

320
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,577
They hit three holdup alarm systems.

321
00:35:21,745 --> 00:35:23,871
Two telco and a cellular.

322
00:35:25,707 --> 00:35:28,667
See, but the signals
aren't going anywhere because....

323
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:34,673
See, the night before, you cut in
and trick out the alarm-system computer. ..

324
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:40,429
...to turn itself and the video recorders off
20 minutes before you walk in the door.

325
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,140
Architectural,
electrical-engineering plans?

326
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:47,561
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards
already built. They go straight into the CPU.

327
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:50,564
What's the estimate?

328
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,529
Twelve-point-one-, 1 2.2 million.

329
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,533
You're on.

330
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:02,743
Congratulations.

331
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:06,872
And to give you a little idea of where my
estimates come from, this is a printout....

332
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,458
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

333
00:36:09,626 --> 00:36:13,128
Be that as it may, my way you get
1 00 percent from the insurance company.. .

334
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,965
...and take the bonds from us
at 60 cents on the dollar...

335
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,217
...and make yourself another 40 percent.

336
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,763
Your operation doesn't skip a beat.
Everybody makes out.

337
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:25,432
Sure, you got a deal.

338
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,311
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

339
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:33,107
Yeah, so you have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

340
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,650
Yeah, okay.

341
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,485
Nice talking to you.

342
00:36:37,571 --> 00:36:39,113
You gonna deal with these guys?

343
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:42,283
So word's out on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

344
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,119
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

345
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:48,581
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Islands' offshore.

346
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,046
KELSO: That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

347
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,508
I have a printout of the, uh, cash flow
of the bank for the past two months.

348
00:36:59,676 --> 00:37:02,303
How'd you get this information?
Just comes to you.

349
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,305
This stuff just flies through the air.

350
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,474
They send information out
and it's beamed out all over the place.

351
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:10,978
All you have to do is know how to grab it.
See, I know how to grab it.

352
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,946
Um-- Okay, here we go.
Thirteen-point-nine million.

353
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,576
I bought it.
Good.

354
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,536
What did l tell you?

355
00:37:30,916 --> 00:37:32,416
Here.

356
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:36,837
We're on.
Call Van Zant, collect the money.

357
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,925
How is he?
He's a businessman.

358
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,886
Okay.

359
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:13,248
CHARLENE: Avocado.
"Avocado."

360
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,419
- Hello?
- NEIL : Yeah, hello.

361
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,880
Chris is at my place.

362
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,679
What's wrong?
Husband-and-wife stuff.

363
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:29,723
I'll let him sleep it off here.

364
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,280
What happened to you?

365
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:53,080
When you gonna get some furniture?
When l get around to it.

366
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,793
Charlene's gonna leave me.

367
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,338
Why?

368
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:06,093
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

369
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:09,346
With everything we've been doing?

370
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,350
Vegas and the Super Bowl
cleaned me out.

371
00:39:13,727 --> 00:39:17,938
When you gonna get an old lady?
When l get around to it.

372
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,984
You got something else on the side?

373
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:24,945
Nothing regular.

374
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,948
She got something else on the side?

375
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:29,450
No.
You sure?

376
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,619
Yeah, l'm sure.

377
00:39:34,414 --> 00:39:36,498
I don't know what you're doing.

378
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:39,877
Remember Jimmy MacAwain
on the yard used to say:

379
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,962
"You wanna be making moves
on the street?

380
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,132
Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life.. .

381
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,718
...that you cannot walk out on
in 30 seconds flat. ..

382
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:50,345
...if you spot the heat
around the corner."

383
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,056
Remember that?

384
00:39:58,688 --> 00:40:01,815
For me,
the sun rises and sets with her, man.

385
00:40:03,151 --> 00:40:04,234
Yeah?

386
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,945
Yeah.

387
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:10,783
Okay.

388
00:40:15,789 --> 00:40:17,998
Today we take delivery of cash
from Van Zant.. .

389
00:40:18,166 --> 00:40:21,210
...then l drop our deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

390
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,669
Bank? What bank?

391
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,839
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

392
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,008
That goes too, then the bank.

393
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:34,765
You want some breakfast?
Yeah.

394
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:42,689
Are you okay?

395
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,942
Yeah, sugar.

396
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,365
Yeah.

397
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,783
For real.
Okay.

398
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:53,992
Gonna do good.

399
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,203
I'll see you later.

400
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:14,513
You Solenko?
I'm Don Breedan.

401
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:18,809
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come by here and see if you had a job for me.

402
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:22,896
You're familiar with this kind of operation?
Yeah, man. l'm a great grill man.

403
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:26,400
Good. Good for you. Here,
you'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher. ..

404
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,569
...bus tables and empty the garbage too.

405
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:31,655
Give me a hard time,
I'll report you loaded, drunk or stealing.

406
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:34,408
And l will violate you back so fast
your head will spin.

407
00:41:34,576 --> 00:41:37,077
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

408
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,747
Rules of the game.
Call Grierson, check it out.

409
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,833
Change in the back.

410
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,257
Well, what are you waiting for?

411
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,028
WOMAN:
Malibu Equity and Investments.

412
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:14,198
Yeah, Roger Van Zant.
Please hold.

413
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,162
ROGER:
Yeah, this is Roger Van Zant.

414
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,872
I'm supposed to collect something.

415
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:26,293
Give me your number, and somebody
will call you right back from a different line.

416
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,464
81 8-1 33-6089.

417
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,072
Yep.

418
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,990
HUGH:
I got a package for you.

419
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:59,201
There's a drive-in on Centinela.
Two-thirty tomorrow.

420
00:42:59,369 --> 00:43:01,912
Okay, just send one man, alone.

421
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:28,772
Who was that guy?
Nobody.

422
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,525
Who the--? Who--? Who was that guy?

423
00:43:31,693 --> 00:43:34,194
He's nobody.
I gotta know who he is. who is he?

424
00:43:34,362 --> 00:43:35,862
He's nobody, Neil.
Listen, you--

425
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,532
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas.

426
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:41,368
Alan Marciano.
Chris is gonna straighten it up with you.

427
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:44,329
It's too late. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it!
Shut up!

428
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:48,834
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

429
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:53,213
After that, he fucks up,
then l will finance setting you up myself. ..

430
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:55,465
...on my own, anywhere you want.

431
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,635
Dominick will go with you.
And my word counts.

432
00:43:58,803 --> 00:44:02,973
But right now,
you will give him the chance.

433
00:44:06,728 --> 00:44:11,648
Clean up. Go home.

434
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:58,278
Give me all your money.

435
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,739
One day you gonna get smoked
with that shit.

436
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:02,074
Ain't gonna be you, fool.

437
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,080
He's coming in alone. Send him through.
Yeah, got it.

438
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:12,501
On a fist full a nothin',
Meanwhile I'll be puffin'

439
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,419
On a fat blunt, run punk,
You don't know the half

440
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:16,630
Tryin' to talk shit, man,
Please don't make me laugh

441
00:45:16,798 --> 00:45:18,799
These Irish eyes are smilin',
I'm buckwildin'

442
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,884
The House Of Pain is pumpin'
Start jumpin'

443
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:23,095
Freak it, funk it, back seat junk it

444
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:25,263
If you can't get with it
You'll wind up sweatin' it

445
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,391
Then you'll get a beatin' just like an egg

446
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,518
It's so hard to run
When you got a broken leg

447
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:33,980
We got the cake
That you're tryin' to get a crumb off

448
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:36,108
The Irish style, the Celtic jazz

449
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,818
No one has it, just us
That's it

450
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,195
Vincent, hey, man.

451
00:45:41,697 --> 00:45:45,158
Vincent. This is my brother, Richard.
Richard, Vincent.

452
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:47,744
Richard.
Yo, it's all right.

453
00:45:48,121 --> 00:45:50,122
What have you got for me?

454
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,165
Before we even get into that...

455
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:56,503
...there's this crew ripping rides
all along the beach areas, all right?

456
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:59,047
Now, the back of a trim shop on Irvine...

457
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,300
...if somebody was to pay a little visit
this weekend. ..

458
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:06,346
...they might find two Turbos
and a 91 1 Slope.

459
00:46:06,514 --> 00:46:09,182
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition.

460
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:12,102
Hmm?
Eh, l'm a good citizen.

461
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,022
I'm Donald Duck.
So you got something to tell me or what?

462
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:20,068
Check this out, coz.

463
00:46:20,236 --> 00:46:23,864
How do I know
if l tell you what you need to know. ..

464
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,533
...you're gonna do
what the fuck l need to get done?

465
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:30,454
Richard, man, Hanna is straight up, man.
We do business all the time.

466
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,914
I ain't your coz, you rat motherfucker.

467
00:46:33,082 --> 00:46:38,712
And you know because l say so
after l hear what the fuck you gotta tell me.

468
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:41,298
Look here, man.
You understand what I'm saying?

469
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,467
I can get killed for telling you this shit.

470
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:45,760
Or you're gonna get killed
walking your doggie.

471
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:47,762
All right.

472
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:50,223
There's this cat I was
locked up with in Folsom.

473
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:54,644
Did a couple, two, three years.
He got out and l ran into him.

474
00:46:57,607 --> 00:46:59,107
And so?

475
00:46:59,275 --> 00:47:01,693
He's a big fiend for action.

476
00:47:01,861 --> 00:47:05,363
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing. ..

477
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:09,242
...but he goes on and on, running down
to me how he ain't been doing nothing...

478
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:12,078
...and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

479
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:18,251
So right then and there l know
this cat's got something going down.

480
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,718
Pretty fucking great.

481
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,764
Albert, what's wrong with you?

482
00:47:31,307 --> 00:47:34,643
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

483
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:37,979
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

484
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:42,901
That's right.
Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.

485
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:45,445
What do you want for that,
a Junior G-man badge?

486
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,948
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches or what?

487
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:50,283
VINCENT:
Is he kidding me?

488
00:47:52,203 --> 00:47:54,913
I'm telling you, this Slick is no joke.

489
00:47:55,081 --> 00:47:56,581
You know what l'm saying?

490
00:47:56,749 --> 00:47:58,500
Say what? Say what?
What?

491
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:03,588
You said, "Slick." What does that mean?
Slick. That's what he calls people, "Slick."

492
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:07,050
And tell me about him.

493
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:12,681
About 6 feet tall, lot of jailhouse tats.

494
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,141
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

495
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,437
What's his name?

496
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,815
Cheritto.

497
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:24,985
Michael Cheritto.

498
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:30,490
BOSKO:
Thirty-three busts since 1 976.

499
00:48:30,658 --> 00:48:33,159
Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.

500
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:37,122
Two out of a three-to-five-year beef
in Attica. Three years in Marion.

501
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:40,750
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

502
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,752
Jacket's 2 inches thick.
Okay.

503
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,839
Who do l have there now?
Drucker and me, boss. And Schwartz.

504
00:48:46,007 --> 00:48:47,841
Tell SIS l want full surveillance.

505
00:48:48,009 --> 00:48:50,844
That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

506
00:48:51,012 --> 00:48:55,098
We never close. Open seven days a week.
Bug the car, the house, the work.

507
00:48:55,266 --> 00:48:57,350
When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...

508
00:48:57,518 --> 00:48:59,811
...I want pictures
of who he moves and sits with.

509
00:48:59,979 --> 00:49:03,857
Then run makes on them. They got jackets,
I wanna see who they move and sit with.

510
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:06,526
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

511
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,084
Put your hands where l can see them.
What?

512
00:50:04,251 --> 00:50:07,253
Put your hands where l can see them.
All right.

513
00:50:07,463 --> 00:50:11,049
I tell you what to do,
I tell you how to do it.

514
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:15,762
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only. ..

515
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,432
...take the package and throw it in here.

516
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:38,952
Fuck. Behind you. On the right.

517
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,242
Unh!

518
00:51:58,741 --> 00:52:00,617
Yeah, Roger Van Zant?

519
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,745
Yeah, who's this?
You know who this is.

520
00:52:04,747 --> 00:52:06,289
Yes, l do. Yes, I do.

521
00:52:06,457 --> 00:52:11,044
I sent a guy to deliver the package.
He didn't call. Is everything right?

522
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:14,339
NEIL:
Tell you what, forget the money.

523
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:18,384
What?
Forget the money.

524
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,261
Wh--

525
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:24,516
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

526
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,560
What am l doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone--

527
00:52:28,354 --> 00:52:29,395
I don't understand.

528
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:33,233
--because there is a dead man
on the other end of this fucking line.

529
00:52:53,087 --> 00:52:54,754
Oh, my.

530
00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:57,257
MICHAEL: Do you like it?
Look at my ring.

531
00:52:57,424 --> 00:52:59,843
Wow.
Ha-ha-ha.

532
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,765
Did you know about this?
It's so beautiful.

533
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:07,600
You are insane.

534
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,731
Do you like it?

535
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,775
It's beautiful.
Yeah, it's pretty good.

536
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,279
Just don't ask him where he got it.
ELAINE: Yeah, that's right. Ha-ha-ha.

537
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:28,997
MICHAEL: What do you wanna be
when you grow up, honey?

538
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,374
I don't know.

539
00:53:33,794 --> 00:53:36,546
She doesn't know.
Just like me. I don't know either.

540
00:53:51,145 --> 00:53:52,478
Hello?

541
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,564
Hi, it's me.

542
00:53:54,732 --> 00:53:58,484
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

543
00:53:59,695 --> 00:54:02,572
I've been busy. Can l see you?

544
00:54:03,115 --> 00:54:07,744
I was afraid that was just
the one night, you know?

545
00:54:08,454 --> 00:54:10,830
No, not for me, it wasn't.

546
00:54:12,875 --> 00:54:14,918
Yeah, me neither.

547
00:54:16,545 --> 00:54:18,338
Can l fall by?

548
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,675
Yeah.
Okay, l'll see you in a little bit.

549
00:54:33,062 --> 00:54:34,854
ELAINE:
Thank you.

550
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:37,357
Good night.
Ha-ha-ha.

551
00:54:37,858 --> 00:54:39,901
VINCENT:
Goddamn convention.

552
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,154
Which one's Slick?
The wide one.

553
00:54:43,322 --> 00:54:44,530
Got two transmitters.

554
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,742
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

555
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,369
Okay, get ready.

556
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,746
Did you say good night to Neil?
Good night.

557
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:55,541
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis.
SIS has got a revolving tail...

558
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,502
...and hung a wire on the house phone.

559
00:54:59,463 --> 00:55:03,049
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

560
00:55:03,217 --> 00:55:06,094
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

561
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:09,222
Sammy and I think that's gonna
be their next score.

562
00:55:09,390 --> 00:55:11,391
Who's the loner?

563
00:55:13,769 --> 00:55:17,397
First time we're seeing him.
We're not on him yet.

564
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:21,067
Well, get on it.

565
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,327
Okay.

566
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:44,549
When these guys walk out the door
of whatever score they're gonna take next...

567
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:48,594
...they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

568
00:56:03,861 --> 00:56:06,362
Hey, baby. Time to go.

569
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:09,532
WAlNGRO:
I showed you a good time, didn't I?

570
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:11,743
Oh, yeah.

571
00:56:12,995 --> 00:56:16,205
You fly. You cool.

572
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:27,550
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

573
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,721
Mm, I ain't lying. You a hot dog.

574
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:34,474
A regular rodeo rider.

575
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:38,019
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

576
00:56:42,107 --> 00:56:44,734
Now l got to get my ass
street side, sugar.

577
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,195
You don't have a truth-telling style.

578
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:51,908
What are you talking about?
You don't know what this is.

579
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,875
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

580
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,637
Unh!

581
00:57:19,311 --> 00:57:20,978
BARTENDER:
Where you been?

582
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,190
SHU at Pelican Bay.

583
00:57:24,358 --> 00:57:26,734
New Folsom, B-wing.

584
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:31,114
I am a cowboy
looking for anything heavy.

585
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,991
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

586
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,536
That is why I am here.

587
00:57:43,043 --> 00:57:44,794
BARTENDER:
Why don't you--?

588
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:48,506
Why don't you call this guy?

589
00:57:48,674 --> 00:57:51,342
This guy's always putting guys on.

590
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:56,222
Thank you, brother.

591
00:57:57,683 --> 00:57:59,976
MAN: l'll buy you a drink?
WOMAN: Buy me a drink.

592
00:58:05,607 --> 00:58:07,233
What's so funny?
Nothing.

593
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:10,611
It's really dumb.
Something smells negligent.

594
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:13,698
You two are perfect for each other.
How did you meet?

595
00:58:18,287 --> 00:58:20,538
I knew this guy in, uh, grade school.
Uh-oh.

596
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:22,874
He was named Raoul, uh.... Whatever.

597
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:26,711
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers
and fold them over, one over the other.

598
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:28,838
Then he'd turn his eyelids inside out....

599
00:58:29,548 --> 00:58:33,009
I can't keep my hands off you,
and that's the truth.

600
00:58:33,552 --> 00:58:38,514
That's what's so wonderful about you,
in that bestial sort of way.

601
00:58:42,603 --> 00:58:44,228
Woman.

602
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,612
This better be earth-shattering.

603
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,661
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.

604
00:59:00,829 --> 00:59:02,872
Raoul.
To Raoul.

605
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:05,208
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

606
00:59:47,084 --> 00:59:49,377
Here's how we found her.

607
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,675
How old?
Sixteen, seventeen.

608
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,885
Been here about six hours.

609
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,512
How'd she die, Rachel?

610
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:03,099
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

611
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:07,061
VINCENT:
Who's that?

612
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,314
Mother and siblings, I guess.
What the hell they doing here?

613
01:00:10,482 --> 01:00:14,193
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside
knew the girl and called the family.

614
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,529
Okay, let's go.

615
01:00:20,575 --> 01:00:22,410
That's nice.

616
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:26,747
When l run a DNA check on the semen, my
intuition says it's coming up the same guy.

617
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:30,126
So it's a series,
and ending up in your court.

618
01:00:30,294 --> 01:00:33,421
Sheriff's Homicide getting anywhere?
Not yet.

619
01:00:34,673 --> 01:00:36,424
Get her.
Get off me. Get off me.

620
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,092
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

621
01:00:39,094 --> 01:00:40,761
Oh, my God.
VINCENT: Hold it, hold it.

622
01:00:44,808 --> 01:00:48,311
Where is she?
Easy, easy, easy.

623
01:00:50,147 --> 01:00:52,773
Please. Please, come on.

624
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,487
It's okay. lt's okay.
Who did this?

625
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,699
Where's my baby? Where is she?

626
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:05,244
I need to know what happened.

627
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,246
I guess the Earth shattered.

628
01:01:49,498 --> 01:01:53,250
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

629
01:01:54,211 --> 01:01:58,130
I didn't wanna ruin their night too.
What was it?

630
01:02:00,509 --> 01:02:01,675
You don't wanna know.

631
01:02:01,843 --> 01:02:04,178
I'd like to know
what's behind that grim look.

632
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:07,807
I don't do that. You know it.
Let's go. Come on.

633
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:11,685
You never told me I'd be excluded.

634
01:02:12,896 --> 01:02:17,149
I told you when we hooked up, baby,
that you were gonna have to share me...

635
01:02:17,317 --> 01:02:21,070
...with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

636
01:02:21,238 --> 01:02:25,658
And l bought into that sharing
because l love you.

637
01:02:25,826 --> 01:02:31,747
I love you fat, bald, money, no money,
driving a bus. l don't care.

638
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:35,126
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy some of the time.

639
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:37,837
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

640
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,006
Oh, l see. What l should do
is come home and say:

641
01:02:41,550 --> 01:02:45,052
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today.. .

642
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,973
...where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave. ..

643
01:02:49,141 --> 01:02:52,768
...because it was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

644
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,771
Come on, let's share that,
and in sharing it...

645
01:02:55,939 --> 01:03:01,944
...we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit." Right?

646
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,949
Wrong. You know why?

647
01:03:07,117 --> 01:03:09,285
Because you prefer the normal routine:

648
01:03:09,453 --> 01:03:11,662
We fuck,
then you lose the power of speech.

649
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,373
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

650
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:18,335
I preserve it, because l need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

651
01:03:20,088 --> 01:03:21,922
Where l gotta be.

652
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,764
You don't live with me.

653
01:03:33,018 --> 01:03:36,187
You live among the remains
of dead people.

654
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,816
You read the terrain.

655
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,321
You search for signs of passing.. .

656
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:47,531
...for the scent of your prey. ..

657
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,492
...and then you hunt them down.

658
01:03:51,411 --> 01:03:54,705
That's the only thing
you're committed to.

659
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,794
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

660
01:04:05,550 --> 01:04:09,386
What l don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

661
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:27,154
DONALD:
Hey. Miss Lillian.

662
01:04:28,782 --> 01:04:30,908
Let's go, baby.

663
01:04:33,161 --> 01:04:37,206
I met the manager. ls that the boss?

664
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:40,543
I did time for what
that motherfucker does every day.

665
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:45,130
Baby, can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

666
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:47,466
Can you do that?

667
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,513
Ain't a hard time been invented
that l cannot handle.

668
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:00,813
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

669
01:05:02,023 --> 01:05:04,316
Because I'm proud of you.

670
01:05:09,906 --> 01:05:12,950
You're proud of me?
Mm-hm.

671
01:05:16,371 --> 01:05:18,956
What the hell you proud of me for?

672
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:21,917
Come on home.

673
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:35,681
What were you doing there?
I was skiing.

674
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:38,058
I was trying to ski.

675
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:41,604
That's what people do there.
You go skiing. ..

676
01:05:42,188 --> 01:05:44,106
...and you meet people.

677
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:45,774
You try to have a good time.

678
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:47,610
Did you have a good time?
No.

679
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:48,902
Why not?

680
01:05:49,321 --> 01:05:51,405
I'm not good at meeting people.

681
01:05:51,573 --> 01:05:53,490
You met me.

682
01:05:53,825 --> 01:05:56,577
Well, that happened
without my thinking about it.

683
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:59,246
Which is why, probably.

684
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:01,957
No, it's because you were fine.

685
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,544
Eady.

686
01:06:06,713 --> 01:06:09,256
Take off with me for a while.

687
01:06:10,091 --> 01:06:12,509
Where?
New Zealand.

688
01:06:14,346 --> 01:06:15,929
When?

689
01:06:17,015 --> 01:06:19,475
I have to go separate,
but you could meet me there.

690
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:21,644
But my job, my--

691
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:26,649
I got money. You don't need money.
You could set up a studio, do work there.

692
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:29,652
I don't know.
What's there to know?

693
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,779
Are you married?

694
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:34,448
What?
You come and go--

695
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,241
The last thing I am is married.

696
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:39,453
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way, a double blank.

697
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,455
Then, all of a sudden...

698
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,667
...someone like you comes along.

699
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,839
You don't know me, Neil.
I know enough.

700
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:56,387
Come with me.

701
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,815
What's wrong, baby?

702
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,277
Nothing's wrong.
Everything's right. Will you go?

703
01:07:16,658 --> 01:07:18,367
Yeah.

704
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,247
Good.

705
01:07:47,439 --> 01:07:49,815
Hey, sweetie.
LAUREN: Hi.

706
01:07:50,233 --> 01:07:53,193
What happened? You forget
your mom was picking you up?

707
01:07:54,362 --> 01:07:56,155
No.

708
01:07:57,449 --> 01:07:59,533
So, what's going on?

709
01:08:00,952 --> 01:08:03,245
I felt like being alone.

710
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,875
Okay. Come on, l'll drive you home.

711
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:16,383
Hey, Mike.
Hey, Lauren.

712
01:09:04,557 --> 01:09:05,599
What's happening?

713
01:09:06,851 --> 01:09:08,602
Lieutenant. Sir.

714
01:09:08,770 --> 01:09:11,396
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

715
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,566
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

716
01:09:29,707 --> 01:09:31,959
Jackson's a... .

717
01:10:08,788 --> 01:10:10,455
Technique.

718
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,894
VINCENT:
Open sesame. Right there.

719
01:11:29,160 --> 01:11:31,161
There he goes.

720
01:12:33,307 --> 01:12:34,975
We walk.
I'm right there.

721
01:12:35,143 --> 01:12:37,144
We walk! Now! Come on.

722
01:12:48,781 --> 01:12:50,574
He's heard it.

723
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:52,993
He's heard it.

724
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,086
Heads up.

725
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:05,881
One's coming out.
Hold it, captain.

726
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:09,676
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.
Yeah, l see.

727
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,057
Here we go.
Not till my boss says so.

728
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,726
Vincent, both of them
are not carrying anything.

729
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,570
Okay, let them go.
JACKSON: What do you mean?

730
01:13:28,738 --> 01:13:29,780
We can take them--

731
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:32,032
What are you gonna take them on?
Breaking and entry?

732
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:34,284
They didn't steal anything.
Don't you get it?

733
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,703
It gets knocked back
to some misdemeanor...

734
01:13:36,871 --> 01:13:39,372
...they do six months
and they're out. No fucking way.

735
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:42,667
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They're not walking.

736
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:46,505
That's exactly what they're gonna do.
They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

737
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:49,049
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

738
01:13:49,217 --> 01:13:53,345
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck.

739
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,475
Back to work.

740
01:14:41,686 --> 01:14:45,605
L.A.P.D. Gee, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

741
01:14:45,773 --> 01:14:47,440
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

742
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:51,069
The place, not us. Because
it's been hit a couple of times, you know.

743
01:14:51,237 --> 01:14:53,905
Assume they got our phones,
assume they got our houses. ..

744
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,575
...assume they got us right here,
right now as we sit.

745
01:14:56,742 --> 01:14:58,702
Everything. Assume it all.

746
01:14:58,870 --> 01:15:00,954
How we gonna buy the bank package
from Kelso?

747
01:15:01,122 --> 01:15:04,291
I'll front that. That's not a problem.
What happens to Van Zant?

748
01:15:04,458 --> 01:15:08,461
With the heat we got, do you wanna play
World war I l in the streets with Van Zant?

749
01:15:08,629 --> 01:15:10,547
No, I want my 750.
And he gets a pass?

750
01:15:10,715 --> 01:15:15,051
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

751
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:17,637
Our problem is,
take the bank or split right now?

752
01:15:17,805 --> 01:15:20,307
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

753
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:23,643
Thirty seconds flat from now,
we are gone on our separate ways.

754
01:15:23,811 --> 01:15:25,061
That's it.

755
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,813
Chris.

756
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:32,152
The bank is worth the risk.

757
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:34,321
I need it, brother.

758
01:15:35,406 --> 01:15:39,159
We should stay and take it down.
That's where l come out.

759
01:15:49,629 --> 01:15:52,756
I roll with you, Neil.
Whatever. Whatever.

760
01:15:52,924 --> 01:15:56,384
No, not on this one, Michael.
On this one, you're on your own.

761
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:11,358
You figure this is the best thing to do?

762
01:16:11,776 --> 01:16:13,360
This is the best thing to do?

763
01:16:13,527 --> 01:16:17,781
I got plans. l'm going away after. So for me
the reward is maybe worth the stretch.

764
01:16:17,949 --> 01:16:20,867
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

765
01:16:21,035 --> 01:16:22,535
You got T-bonds, real estate.

766
01:16:22,703 --> 01:16:26,081
If I were you, l would be smart.
I would cut loose of this.

767
01:16:44,517 --> 01:16:48,228
Well, you know, for me,
the action is the juice.

768
01:16:48,396 --> 01:16:49,437
I'm in.

769
01:16:53,943 --> 01:16:54,943
You too?

770
01:16:55,278 --> 01:16:56,861
Yeah, sure.

771
01:16:57,029 --> 01:16:58,697
MICHAEL: Ha-ha-ha.
Let's go.

772
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,740
MICHAEL:
Fuck them, let's do it.

773
01:17:00,908 --> 01:17:03,493
NEIL: All right, let's go.
We got a lot of work to do.

774
01:17:16,924 --> 01:17:18,842
WOMAN: You can't go in there.
VINCENT: Watch this.

775
01:17:19,010 --> 01:17:21,177
WOMAN: Excuse me. That--
ALAN: Tim, l gotta call you back.

776
01:17:21,345 --> 01:17:22,804
WOMAN:
You have to have an appointment.

777
01:17:22,972 --> 01:17:24,806
Can l help you?
Are you Alan Marciano?

778
01:17:24,974 --> 01:17:27,434
Yeah, and who the fuck are you? Ow.
Who am I?

779
01:17:27,601 --> 01:17:30,687
Hey. Hey.
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

780
01:17:30,855 --> 01:17:34,107
L.A.? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

781
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:37,777
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck
you guys think you're pushing around...

782
01:17:37,945 --> 01:17:43,283
...but I know people here, okay?
Las Vegas P.D. takes you into custody.

783
01:17:43,909 --> 01:17:46,911
You are extradited to Newark
on a New Jersey warrant...

784
01:17:47,079 --> 01:17:50,332
...for smuggling cigarettes
up from North Carolina three years ago. ..

785
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,667
...or you go to work for us.

786
01:17:52,835 --> 01:17:54,627
Cut and dried.

787
01:17:54,795 --> 01:17:57,630
That is it.
Oh, shit.

788
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,550
Charlene Shiherlis.

789
01:18:00,718 --> 01:18:02,469
Who?
Who?

790
01:18:03,012 --> 01:18:04,804
Who? what are you, a fucking owl?

791
01:18:05,181 --> 01:18:08,808
SCHWARTZ: The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day the last week.

792
01:18:08,976 --> 01:18:11,227
Yeah, you know what?
You can't tie me to her.

793
01:18:11,395 --> 01:18:15,315
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jack off.

794
01:18:15,483 --> 01:18:19,361
Oh, man, l just--
Why did l get mixed up with that bitch?

795
01:18:19,528 --> 01:18:22,238
Because she got a great ass!

796
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,910
And you got your head all the way up it.

797
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:28,495
ALAN:
Jesus.

798
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:34,667
When l think of asses, a woman's ass.. .

799
01:18:34,835 --> 01:18:37,170
...something comes out of me.

800
01:18:38,547 --> 01:18:40,590
So?
So no big thing.

801
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:45,887
All I want is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

802
01:18:46,055 --> 01:18:48,348
Now, you're gonna work
with Sergeant Drucker here.

803
01:18:52,812 --> 01:18:55,605
San Clemente Road and Hermosa.
Uh-huh.

804
01:18:55,773 --> 01:18:58,441
That's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

805
01:18:58,609 --> 01:18:59,734
Right.

806
01:18:59,902 --> 01:19:02,737
The security systems
around here are a joke.

807
01:19:07,368 --> 01:19:10,036
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's Escape Route Number 1 .

808
01:19:10,955 --> 01:19:14,207
Number 2, over here,
Anaheim to the 1 1 0.

809
01:19:14,667 --> 01:19:15,708
Good.
Okay?

810
01:19:15,876 --> 01:19:18,586
Yeah. That's fine.
Got it? Good. Let's go.

811
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,570
CASALS:
They were looking back.. .

812
01:19:44,071 --> 01:19:46,072
...in this direction.

813
01:19:46,407 --> 01:19:48,241
DRUCKER:
A container facility?

814
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:52,954
For a cartage theft?
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

815
01:19:56,083 --> 01:19:59,085
Next door's an oil refinery,
over there's a scrap yard.

816
01:19:59,253 --> 01:20:03,756
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around.
Same for the scrap yard.

817
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:09,471
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

818
01:20:12,725 --> 01:20:15,935
A refinery and a scrap yard.

819
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:19,939
What the hell is going on?
That's what we're trying to figure out.

820
01:20:20,941 --> 01:20:22,942
We thought we had it.

821
01:20:23,736 --> 01:20:24,777
Thought we had it.

822
01:20:34,455 --> 01:20:39,000
I got an idea
of what they were looking at.

823
01:20:42,546 --> 01:20:45,215
You wanna know what they're looking at?
What?

824
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:50,011
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

825
01:20:51,138 --> 01:20:54,057
This crew is good.

826
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:57,393
You know what they were looking at?

827
01:20:57,811 --> 01:20:58,978
What?

828
01:21:00,231 --> 01:21:01,898
Us.

829
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:04,817
The L.A.P.D.

830
01:21:04,985 --> 01:21:07,362
The police department.

831
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:10,156
We just got made.

832
01:21:17,623 --> 01:21:19,374
Yeah.

833
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,342
Okay.

834
01:21:38,102 --> 01:21:39,561
Okay, motherfucker!

835
01:22:00,457 --> 01:22:01,833
Kelso come through?

836
01:22:02,334 --> 01:22:05,211
NEIL:
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

837
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:14,053
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

838
01:22:14,597 --> 01:22:18,600
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards.
Hanna's all over you.

839
01:22:18,976 --> 01:22:21,728
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

840
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:24,230
Not yours,
they've been losing you at night.

841
01:22:24,398 --> 01:22:28,484
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school.
Marine Corps.

842
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,778
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide,
Major Crime Unit.

843
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:34,240
He's taken down some heavy crews.
Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

844
01:22:34,408 --> 01:22:36,659
And he was a fucking maniac.

845
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:41,080
He was working Narcotics before that.
Had some problems, divorced twice.

846
01:22:41,248 --> 01:22:44,250
Current wife's Justine.
He's why the extra heat.

847
01:22:46,545 --> 01:22:48,421
The Vice sergeant. ..

848
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:51,758
...says Hanna likes you.

849
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:55,845
Thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

850
01:22:56,013 --> 01:22:58,973
Look how sharp this guy is
to figure that.

851
01:23:00,851 --> 01:23:02,935
Funny as a heart attack, man.
Three marriages.

852
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:06,397
What the fuck do you think that means?
He likes staying home?

853
01:23:06,774 --> 01:23:09,275
Means the man is one of those guys
out there...

854
01:23:09,443 --> 01:23:12,362
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

855
01:23:14,615 --> 01:23:16,866
With this guy and this much heat,
you should pass.

856
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,625
It's worth the stretch.

857
01:23:26,835 --> 01:23:31,464
This guy can hit and miss.
You can't miss once.

858
01:23:31,799 --> 01:23:33,633
You sure?

859
01:23:34,051 --> 01:23:35,968
I'm sure.

860
01:23:41,308 --> 01:23:42,642
Let's go to the garage.

861
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,157
Justine.

862
01:24:03,497 --> 01:24:05,456
Justine?

863
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:13,131
Where we going?

864
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:21,222
Okay, where are you going?
Out.

865
01:25:19,573 --> 01:25:22,575
What are you on?
MAN: TAC 9.

866
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:49,310
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 1 8.
Who have I got?

867
01:25:49,645 --> 01:25:53,231
JJ: Hey, Vincent, it's JJ. I'm in Air 40.
Richard Glover's with me.

868
01:25:53,398 --> 01:25:57,568
It's on the 1 05 eastbound
approaching the 1 1 0 interchange.

869
01:25:58,237 --> 01:26:02,615
You running a revolving tail?
Yeah, I got two units in front, three behind.

870
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:06,828
Okay, have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

871
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,412
Let's go.

872
01:26:58,422 --> 01:27:02,383
Am l 1 00 yards, or what?
Am l close or far, or what?

873
01:27:02,551 --> 01:27:05,136
CASALS:
Three hundred yards, center lane.

874
01:28:11,745 --> 01:28:13,579
How you doing?

875
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:19,794
What do you say
I buy you a cup of coffee?

876
01:28:25,926 --> 01:28:29,220
Yeah, sure. Let's go.
Follow me.

877
01:28:44,987 --> 01:28:47,446
Seven years in Folsom.

878
01:28:47,614 --> 01:28:49,448
In the hole for three.

879
01:28:49,616 --> 01:28:50,908
McNeil before that.

880
01:28:54,496 --> 01:28:56,831
McNeil as tough as they say?

881
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:59,583
You looking to become a penologist?

882
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,963
You're looking to go back?
You know, I chase down some crews.. .

883
01:29:04,131 --> 01:29:08,551
...guys just looking to fuck up,
get busted back. That you?

884
01:29:09,261 --> 01:29:11,470
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

885
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:14,473
I worked all kinds.

886
01:29:17,477 --> 01:29:20,021
You see me doing thrill-seeking
liquor-store holdups. ..

887
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,523
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo
on my chest?

888
01:29:22,691 --> 01:29:25,526
No, I do not.
Right.

889
01:29:26,695 --> 01:29:28,529
I am never going back.

890
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:32,408
Then don't take down scores.

891
01:29:33,577 --> 01:29:36,203
I do what I do best, I take scores.

892
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:39,999
You do what you do best,
trying to stop guys like me.

893
01:29:43,211 --> 01:29:46,047
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

894
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:49,216
What the fuck is that?
Barbecues and ball games?

895
01:29:50,969 --> 01:29:52,094
Yeah.

896
01:29:54,556 --> 01:29:59,769
This regular-type life like your life?
My life? No, my life... .

897
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,688
No, my life's a disaster zone.

898
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:07,276
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up.. .

899
01:30:07,444 --> 01:30:10,529
...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

900
01:30:10,697 --> 01:30:14,575
I got a wife. We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage...

901
01:30:14,743 --> 01:30:16,619
...my third.. .

902
01:30:18,038 --> 01:30:21,707
...because l spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

903
01:30:21,875 --> 01:30:23,918
That's my life.

904
01:30:29,716 --> 01:30:31,967
A guy told me one time:

905
01:30:33,386 --> 01:30:35,513
"Don't let yourself get attached
to anything...

906
01:30:35,680 --> 01:30:38,390
...you are not willing to walk out on
in 30 seconds flat. ..

907
01:30:38,558 --> 01:30:40,726
...if you feel the heat around the corner."

908
01:30:41,770 --> 01:30:45,189
Now, if you're on me,
and you gotta move when I move.. .

909
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:48,526
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

910
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:52,571
Well, that's an interesting point.

911
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:55,950
What are you, a monk?

912
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:57,910
I have a woman.

913
01:30:58,078 --> 01:31:00,079
What do you tell her?

914
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:04,041
I tell her I'm a salesman.

915
01:31:10,382 --> 01:31:13,926
So then, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

916
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:17,096
...you're just gonna walk out
on this woman?

917
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:20,057
Not say goodbye?

918
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,560
That's the discipline.

919
01:31:22,769 --> 01:31:24,687
That's pretty vacant, no?

920
01:31:24,855 --> 01:31:26,522
Yeah, it is what it is.

921
01:31:26,690 --> 01:31:29,316
It's that, or we both better
go do something else, pal.

922
01:31:31,444 --> 01:31:33,237
I don't know how to do anything else.

923
01:31:33,822 --> 01:31:35,698
Neither do l.

924
01:31:38,160 --> 01:31:41,620
I don't much want to either.
Neither do l.

925
01:31:49,296 --> 01:31:52,882
You know, I have this recurring dream.

926
01:31:53,842 --> 01:31:56,510
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

927
01:31:56,678 --> 01:32:00,556
...and all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting at this table. ..

928
01:32:00,724 --> 01:32:04,977
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

929
01:32:05,145 --> 01:32:10,149
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

930
01:32:10,483 --> 01:32:13,986
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

931
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:17,239
...because l found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

932
01:32:18,074 --> 01:32:20,910
The neighbors reported the smell. ..

933
01:32:21,453 --> 01:32:25,456
...and there they are,
all of them just sitting there.

934
01:32:27,167 --> 01:32:28,209
What do they say?

935
01:32:30,420 --> 01:32:31,670
Nothing.

936
01:32:31,838 --> 01:32:33,505
No talk?
None.

937
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:37,301
Just....
They don't have anything to say.

938
01:32:37,928 --> 01:32:40,346
See, we just look at each other.

939
01:32:40,805 --> 01:32:45,643
They look at me.
And that's it, that's the dream.

940
01:32:47,979 --> 01:32:50,397
I have one where I'm drowning.

941
01:32:50,690 --> 01:32:54,235
And l gotta wake myself up
and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

942
01:32:56,446 --> 01:32:57,821
You know what that's about?

943
01:32:58,323 --> 01:33:01,033
Yeah. Having enough time.

944
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:07,790
Enough time to do what you wanna do?
That's right.

945
01:33:09,751 --> 01:33:13,379
You doing it now?
No, not yet.

946
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,552
You know, we're sitting here...

947
01:33:21,596 --> 01:33:23,722
...you and l,
like a couple of regular fellows.

948
01:33:23,890 --> 01:33:26,600
You do what you do,
and l do what I gotta do.

949
01:33:28,895 --> 01:33:31,897
And now that we've been face to face. ..

950
01:33:34,192 --> 01:33:39,196
...if l'm there and I gotta put you away,
I won't like it.

951
01:33:39,572 --> 01:33:40,698
But l'll tell you.. .

952
01:33:43,243 --> 01:33:46,745
...if it's between you
and some poor bastard.. .

953
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:49,415
...whose wife you're gonna
turn into a widow.. .

954
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:54,586
...brother, you are going down.

955
01:34:06,308 --> 01:34:09,143
There's a flip side to that coin.

956
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:15,274
What if you do got me boxed in
and l gotta put you down?

957
01:34:16,568 --> 01:34:21,280
Because no matter what,
you will not get in my way.

958
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:24,908
We've been face to face, yeah...

959
01:34:27,537 --> 01:34:31,623
...but I will not hesitate.
Not for a second.

960
01:34:37,464 --> 01:34:39,798
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

961
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:44,762
Or who knows?

962
01:34:44,971 --> 01:34:47,723
Or maybe
we'll never see each other again.

963
01:35:03,239 --> 01:35:04,782
They dumped us.

964
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,409
What?

965
01:35:07,577 --> 01:35:10,871
They dumped us.
What do you mean, they dumped us?

966
01:35:11,039 --> 01:35:12,122
Chris slipped his tail.

967
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,875
He doesn't talk about scores
with Charlene...

968
01:35:15,043 --> 01:35:17,628
...so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I tried.

969
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,047
What about Cheritto?
CASALS: Same.

970
01:35:20,215 --> 01:35:22,966
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

971
01:35:25,387 --> 01:35:29,848
They dumped all our surveillance?
Yeah, at the same time. Nine p.m.

972
01:35:30,850 --> 01:35:34,186
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

973
01:35:34,354 --> 01:35:36,688
We were on you.
Then McCauley drives into LAX...

974
01:35:36,856 --> 01:35:39,858
...where surveillance can't fly over
because of flight paths.

975
01:35:40,026 --> 01:35:43,362
His car's still there. He's gone.

976
01:35:47,784 --> 01:35:53,747
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

977
01:36:52,390 --> 01:36:54,099
HUGH:
You hear from him yet?

978
01:36:54,267 --> 01:36:58,729
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

979
01:37:00,815 --> 01:37:05,527
This guy here. We put him on.
Says he knows McCauley.

980
01:37:10,700 --> 01:37:11,742
Who are you?

981
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:16,788
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

982
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:20,542
I've been living in this office day and night.
How well do you know him?

983
01:37:21,294 --> 01:37:24,796
Oh, we took some major scores together.

984
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,801
How come I haven't heard from him?

985
01:37:29,969 --> 01:37:33,805
Well, he's probably busy right now,
but he's real thorough.

986
01:37:35,225 --> 01:37:39,102
He ain't gonna forget about you.
Oh, that's reassuring.

987
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:44,024
Well, I got some moves
I could make here.

988
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:47,486
Probably be a big help to you.

989
01:38:08,508 --> 01:38:09,841
You recognize the grill man?

990
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:22,312
No.
Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

991
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:27,526
Ain't got my break yet, man.
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

992
01:38:27,694 --> 01:38:30,696
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

993
01:38:30,863 --> 01:38:32,823
Take your break later.

994
01:38:32,991 --> 01:38:36,326
Piece of shit. Pick up.

995
01:38:39,080 --> 01:38:40,831
Where the hell is he?

996
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:44,334
I wanted to check the slot for a work car.
So did l.

997
01:38:49,507 --> 01:38:50,924
Yeah?

998
01:38:52,135 --> 01:38:53,635
Hang on.

999
01:38:54,012 --> 01:38:55,929
Yeah.
Hey.

1000
01:38:56,097 --> 01:39:00,642
Use a landline. Call me at 1 03-7206.

1001
01:39:00,810 --> 01:39:02,060
All right.

1002
01:39:12,947 --> 01:39:15,073
Where are you?
There's cops all over me, man.

1003
01:39:15,241 --> 01:39:19,244
They're on me like a cheap suit.
I can't dump them.

1004
01:39:21,748 --> 01:39:25,709
After the fact you spotted them?
No, no. They're doing parallels.

1005
01:39:28,588 --> 01:39:30,005
I can try to dump them again.

1006
01:39:30,173 --> 01:39:34,551
How are we gonna know if you did?
If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

1007
01:39:34,927 --> 01:39:36,845
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

1008
01:39:37,013 --> 01:39:41,099
All right. Hey, l'm sorry, man.
Last thing I wanna do is let you down.

1009
01:40:03,956 --> 01:40:05,707
MAN:
Come on, man.

1010
01:40:07,251 --> 01:40:08,919
Pick up.

1011
01:40:09,671 --> 01:40:12,714
Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up?
What's up, brother?

1012
01:40:12,882 --> 01:40:15,258
Man, what you doing here?

1013
01:40:15,426 --> 01:40:19,179
What l am doing is l'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners and a radio.

1014
01:40:19,347 --> 01:40:20,389
Right now, today.

1015
01:40:20,556 --> 01:40:21,973
You remember the drill?

1016
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:23,517
Yeah, man, sure.

1017
01:40:23,726 --> 01:40:25,018
You cool?

1018
01:40:25,436 --> 01:40:27,646
Oh, man, now, you know l'm cool.

1019
01:40:27,814 --> 01:40:31,149
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

1020
01:40:44,455 --> 01:40:47,374
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1021
01:40:48,710 --> 01:40:50,836
Out back in five.

1022
01:40:59,846 --> 01:41:02,472
What's burning? What's burning?
COOK: Nothing l'm doing.

1023
01:41:02,640 --> 01:41:04,349
MANAGER:
What is this?

1024
01:41:04,517 --> 01:41:06,685
Where do you think you're going?

1025
01:41:10,273 --> 01:41:13,900
WOMAN: Just came across a first edition
of Kandinsky's Theory of Color.

1026
01:41:14,068 --> 01:41:16,319
Yeah. No, it's in good condition.

1027
01:41:16,487 --> 01:41:19,823
MAN : And it will not stop
or answer radio communication.

1028
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:23,368
The 1 80-foot vessel is called
Jin Yin Number 1 ...

1029
01:41:23,536 --> 01:41:26,538
...and is suspected of smuggling
Chinese illegal aliens.

1030
01:41:26,706 --> 01:41:28,707
It was spotted Saturday by patrol aircraft.

1031
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:43,573
MICHAEL: Stay down.
NEIL: Don't move! Don't fucking move!

1032
01:42:43,741 --> 01:42:47,118
Put your hands in the air!
Put your hands in the air! Put them up!

1033
01:42:47,286 --> 01:42:50,288
Down, down! Get on your knees.

MICHAEL: Give me the keys.
NEIL: Get on your knees.

01:42:57,255 --> 01:43:00,966
Hey. Hey! Get over there.
Get the fuck-- Get down.

1037
01:43:01,133 --> 01:43:03,635
Turn around! Put your hands behind you.
Behind you!

1038
01:43:03,803 --> 01:43:05,762
MICHAEL:
Get down! Stay down!

1039
01:43:06,681 --> 01:43:09,683
Get down! Get down!
Down, you stupid son of a--

1040

Down! Down, now!
NEIL: Keys! Keys! Keys!

1041
01:43:17,483 --> 01:43:18,817
All of you stay down.

1042
01:43:19,986 --> 01:43:23,321
We want to hurt no one. We're here
for the bank's money, not your money.

1043
01:43:23,489 --> 01:43:25,991
Your money's insured.
You're not gonna lose a dime.

1044
01:43:26,158 --> 01:43:29,995
Think of your families. Don't risk your life.
Don't try and be a hero.

1045
01:43:30,162 --> 01:43:33,665
Right now l want you to sit on the floor
and put your hands on your head.

1046
01:43:33,833 --> 01:43:38,336
Anybody feels sick, anybody got heart
trouble, go ahead and lean against the wall.

1047
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:41,715
Give me the key.
What key?

1048
01:43:43,342 --> 01:43:46,386
MICHAEL:
Get down and stay down!

1049
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:49,180
Sit there. Sit there. Don't move.
Let it bleed.

1050
01:43:58,482 --> 01:44:00,191
MICHAEL:

1053
01:44:38,356 --> 01:44:40,690
MICHAEL: Look at me again, I'll kill you.
NEIL: Stay down. Down.

01:44:40,858 --> 01:44:45,195
MICHAEL: Put your head down!
Get down. Get down.

1055

Hey, Casals.
CASALS: Yeah.

1056
01:45:07,718 --> 01:45:10,095
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1057
01:45:10,262 --> 01:45:14,557
This CI , Hugh Benny, called in about a bank
they're looking at or something.

1058
01:45:14,767 --> 01:45:15,934

Okay, we're gonna have to take them
in the car. wait till they are all in.

Get clean shots.
Watch your background.

1065
01:46:39,060 --> 01:46:40,518
Police! Move!
What's going on?

1066
01:46:42,021 --> 01:46:43,688
VINCENT:
Move. Move. Get down.

1067
01:46:47,985 --> 01:46:49,027
Look out.

1068
01:47:01,874 --> 01:47:03,917
CASALS: Move it, come on.
DRUCKER: L.A.P.D. Get down.

1069
01:47:05,544 --> 01:47:06,878
Move it. Down, down, down.

1070
01:47:10,132 --> 01:47:12,217
We did it, right, Neil? Huh?

1071
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:17,514
Move!
Ahh!

1072
01:47:23,270 --> 01:47:24,896

DON: Son of a bitch!
Go, go!

1077
01:48:53,903 --> 01:49:21,346
Go!

1078
01:50:07,351 --> 01:50:09,060
Go!

1079
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:04,699
Come on. Come on.

1080
01:51:10,164 --> 01:51:12,332
MAN:
Get him out of here.

1081
01:51:36,106 --> 01:51:38,191
Get down! Now!

1082
01:51:39,109 --> 01:51:40,526
Aah!

1083
01:51:40,778 --> 01:51:42,362

WOMAN:
Shit.

1085
01:51:50,954 --> 01:51:54,999
Out of the way! Down! Out of the way!
Get them down! Now, now!

1086
01:51:55,167 --> 01:51:57,377
No, out of the way. Out of the way.

1087
01:52:46,552 --> 01:52:49,178
GlRL:
Mommy? Mommy!

1088
01:52:49,638 --> 01:52:50,638
Oh!

1089
01:52:54,726 --> 01:52:56,477
Come here, honey.

1090
01:53:38,061 --> 01:53:39,103
VINCENT:
Come on, honey.

1091
01:53:41,690 --> 01:53:45,818
I got you. lt's okay now.

C;audia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest. Claudia?

1094
01:53:55,370 --> 01:53:59,123
This afternoon, this neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.

1095
01:53:59,291 --> 01:54:03,127
With the streets full of mid-day shoppers
and kids, police and armed robbers....

1096
01:54:03,295 --> 01:54:05,963
Excuse me, bartender?
BARTENDER: One minute, lady.

1097
01:54:06,131 --> 01:54:08,674
REPORTER:
--robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.

1098
01:54:08,842 --> 01:54:11,969
A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...

1099
01:54:12,137 --> 01:54:14,722
...that ended in homicide and terror.

1100
01:54:14,890 --> 01:54:18,726
One suspect, Michael Cheritto, is one
of four men involved in the foiled robbery.

1101
01:54:18,894 --> 01:54:21,145
He died at the scene.
BARTENDER: What can l get you, miss?

1102
01:54:21,313 --> 01:54:23,648
Also fatally wounded,
suspect Donald Breedan....

Miss?

1104
01:54:25,484 --> 01:54:29,320
REPORTER: --during the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.

1105
01:54:31,114 --> 01:54:32,865
All right, hold him. Hold him.

1106
01:54:33,033 --> 01:54:34,450
All right. All right.
It's all right.

1107
01:54:42,709 --> 01:54:45,336
NEIL: So?
Well, he's got blood loss and shock.

1108
01:54:45,504 --> 01:54:50,049
I'm gonna give you quarter-grain morphine
for the pain. Subcutaneous injection.

1109
01:54:50,217 --> 01:54:51,926
Bottom line.

1110
01:54:52,094 --> 01:54:56,180
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good,
but his clavicle's fractured.

1111
01:54:56,348 --> 01:54:59,267
Can he rest for a while?
Six, seven hours.

1112
01:54:59,434 --> 01:55:01,227
That's it?
That's it.

1113
01:55:01,395 --> 01:55:03,646
Take off your shirt.
What?

1114
01:55:05,566 --> 01:55:07,525
Take off your shirt.

1115
01:55:13,865 --> 01:55:16,951
My-- Look, my daughter gave it to me
for Father's Day.

1116
01:55:17,119 --> 01:55:20,037
I don't give a shit who gave it to you.
Take it off.

1117
01:55:25,502 --> 01:55:27,878
Chris. Hey.

1118
01:55:29,965 --> 01:55:32,675
Chris, listen to me.
Hm?

1119
01:55:33,176 --> 01:55:37,054
Nate's gonna pick you up.
He's gonna take you to his place.

1120
01:55:38,557 --> 01:55:41,058
Where's Charlene?
We gotta get out of here.

1121
01:55:41,226 --> 01:55:43,019
We're all over the 6:00 news.

1122
01:55:43,186 --> 01:55:46,522
We gotta get out of here.
I'm not going without her.

1123
01:55:46,690 --> 01:55:50,067
Think about that.
I will meet you at Nate's.

1124
01:55:50,235 --> 01:55:51,360
Where are you going?

1125
01:55:51,528 --> 01:55:55,823
I gotta find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1126
01:55:56,074 --> 01:55:57,742
Who did it?

1127
01:55:58,577 --> 01:56:00,119
Who wasn't there?

1128
01:56:01,121 --> 01:56:02,955
Trejo.

1129
01:56:06,418 --> 01:56:07,585
I'll see you at Nate's.

1130
01:56:14,384 --> 01:56:16,802
ALAN: Yeah.
Yeah. You still want me?

1131
01:56:18,138 --> 01:56:22,224
You come down here right now
and you get me. Dominick and me. Okay?

1132
01:56:22,392 --> 01:56:26,270
Okay, baby, okay.
I'll be there in two hours, all right?

1133
01:56:26,438 --> 01:56:28,689
Okay?
All right.

1134
01:56:30,275 --> 01:56:33,819
Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.

1135
01:56:34,321 --> 01:56:38,240
You're on a plane for Los Angeles.
Great.

1136
01:57:25,997 --> 01:57:28,207
Why'd you do it? What happened?

1137
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:31,419
They made me.
Who?

1138
01:57:31,586 --> 01:57:33,337
Where's Anna?

1139
01:57:33,839 --> 01:57:34,880
She's dead.

1140
01:57:38,093 --> 01:57:41,178
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1141
01:57:41,680 --> 01:57:45,850
Who did it? Who did it?
They had Anna, man.

1142
01:57:46,017 --> 01:57:47,768
Who had her?

1143
01:57:48,520 --> 01:57:52,148
Waingro.

1144
01:57:52,399 --> 01:57:53,524
On his own?

1145
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:57,737
For someone.
Who?

1146
01:57:57,904 --> 01:58:00,239
The other he worked for.

1147
01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:04,076
Zant.

1148
01:58:06,246 --> 01:58:09,623
Van Zant?
Yeah.

1149
01:58:09,791 --> 01:58:11,625
Van Zant.

1150
01:58:11,793 --> 01:58:14,879
Are you sure?
Van Zant.

1151
01:58:16,757 --> 01:58:19,550
Did you say anything
about how we're getting out?

1152
01:58:20,177 --> 01:58:23,220
I don't think so, Neil.
Come on.

1153
01:58:25,182 --> 01:58:26,807
I don't remember, Neil.

1154
01:58:32,314 --> 01:58:36,025
I'll call a medic.
I'm not gonna make it.

1155
01:58:37,527 --> 01:58:40,571
I can't feel nothing.

1156
01:58:41,948 --> 01:58:44,867
My Anna's gone.

1157
01:58:46,036 --> 01:58:48,287
She's gone.

1158
01:58:49,706 --> 01:58:54,001
Don't leave me like this, Neil.
Please, holmes.

1159
01:58:55,337 --> 01:58:58,047
Don't leave me like this.

1160
01:59:21,404 --> 01:59:23,614
- Yeah?
- NEIL : Nate.

1161
01:59:24,241 --> 01:59:26,909
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1162
01:59:27,536 --> 01:59:28,702
It's a new one.

1163
01:59:30,247 --> 01:59:33,040
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1164
01:59:33,208 --> 01:59:36,544
1 0725.
NEIL: 1 0725, okay.

1165
01:59:36,711 --> 01:59:39,922
Chris?
He's with me, at my place.

1166
01:59:40,090 --> 01:59:42,424
Next, Waingro, okay?

1167
01:59:44,553 --> 01:59:45,636
You got the time?

1168
01:59:46,680 --> 01:59:49,974
I'll make time,
and l need a new out laid on.

1169
01:59:50,851 --> 01:59:52,101
How do you know it's blown?

1170
01:59:53,770 --> 01:59:55,896
How can I trust it?

1171
01:59:58,567 --> 02:00:00,442
Okay, you got it.

1172
02:00:00,610 --> 02:00:02,653
Stay healthy.

1173
02:00:07,742 --> 02:00:09,618
VINCENT:
Charlene Shiherlis.

1174
02:00:10,370 --> 02:00:13,163
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

1175
02:00:13,331 --> 02:00:16,542
Our Neil's transportation.
When we're done here, get on the phone.

1176
02:00:16,710 --> 02:00:19,253
Somewhere, someone's trying
to put it together for him.

1177
02:00:19,421 --> 02:00:21,797
DRUCKER: You don't believe McCauley
already had a getaway?

1178
02:00:21,965 --> 02:00:26,343
Sure he did. Now he needs another one.
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1179
02:00:27,387 --> 02:00:29,722
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1180
02:00:29,890 --> 02:00:33,434
He's a CI for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1181
02:00:33,602 --> 02:00:37,146
On Neil McCauley,
how much time we got?

1182
02:00:37,314 --> 02:00:40,691
Eight, 1 0 hours for him to set up a new out.
After that, he's gone.

1183
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:42,818
Bye-bye. Bam.

1184
02:01:35,664 --> 02:01:40,084
You ratted McCauley to us.
How'd you know? Who told you?

1185
02:01:40,251 --> 02:01:42,878
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

1186
02:01:43,046 --> 02:01:44,672
Who?

1187
02:02:12,575 --> 02:02:15,953
MAN : Connelly back in for Murphy.
Murphy with Leggat right there with him.

1188
02:02:16,121 --> 02:02:17,913
Murphy tees it up behind the net....

1189
02:02:22,085 --> 02:02:25,295
--Miller out front.
Now here's Murphy with the referee....

1190
02:02:28,883 --> 02:02:30,050
Waingro, where is he?

1191
02:02:31,428 --> 02:02:33,679
Where is he?
How the hell would l know?

1192
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:03,375
Well, what do we have here, hmm?

1193
02:03:03,835 --> 02:03:07,463
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty. Aah!

1194
02:03:09,924 --> 02:03:12,968
You slimy piece of shit.
You told me you wanted out from under.

1195
02:03:13,136 --> 02:03:16,305
You're scared to death, right?
You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1196
02:03:16,473 --> 02:03:20,142
Yeah, what's your end?
I-- You stupid broad.

1197
02:03:20,310 --> 02:03:22,770
How'd l get into this?
Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

1198
02:03:22,937 --> 02:03:24,146
Huh?
You heard me.

1199
02:03:24,314 --> 02:03:27,357
She had a rough ride.
Why don't you fix her a drink or something?

1200
02:03:27,525 --> 02:03:30,527
Look in the cabinet above the sink.
Fuck her.

1201
02:03:32,947 --> 02:03:36,075
You'd better get in there and stay in there.
All right, all right.

1202
02:03:38,828 --> 02:03:41,080
Well, lookie here.

1203
02:03:42,248 --> 02:03:44,541
My name is Sergeant Drucker,
L.A.P.D. Homicide.

1204
02:03:44,709 --> 02:03:48,712
You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom?
He stays with me.

1205
02:03:49,214 --> 02:03:51,131
There we go.

1206
02:03:58,723 --> 02:04:00,682
So, what now?

1207
02:04:02,936 --> 02:04:06,688
Well, he's right,
because you want out, this is out.

1208
02:04:08,108 --> 02:04:11,985
You believe you have to betray Chris.
No shit.

1209
02:04:12,153 --> 02:04:15,114
That's right. You would have to.

1210
02:04:15,281 --> 02:04:19,535
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1211
02:04:20,036 --> 02:04:23,247
Because he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1212
02:04:23,414 --> 02:04:25,874
...because you got no living parents
to take him.

1213
02:04:26,042 --> 02:04:30,420
So he ends up state-raised in foster homes,
juvenile facilities.

1214
02:04:30,588 --> 02:04:32,840
Then he steals a car.

1215
02:04:33,091 --> 02:04:38,262
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1216
02:04:38,429 --> 02:04:41,723
Fucked for life.

1217
02:04:41,891 --> 02:04:45,227
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1218
02:04:46,396 --> 02:04:51,567
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life, but Chris did.

1219
02:04:52,652 --> 02:04:56,238
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1220
02:04:56,406 --> 02:05:00,325
You can do it for your kid,
so you can raise him.

1221
02:05:04,497 --> 02:05:07,875
What else are you selling?
All kinds of shit.

1222
02:05:08,751 --> 02:05:13,964
But l don't have to sell this and you know it,
because this kind of shit here sells itself.

1223
02:05:20,263 --> 02:05:22,264
DRUCKER:
Okay, Danny, here's an update.

1224
02:05:22,432 --> 02:05:25,767
Drucker's on Line 2.
Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1225
02:05:27,937 --> 02:05:30,063
Lieutenant, l have Drucker
on the other line.

1226
02:05:30,231 --> 02:05:31,607
Oh, well, conference him in.

1227
02:05:33,109 --> 02:05:36,820
Go ahead.
Vincent, it's me.

1228
02:05:38,740 --> 02:05:41,366
I want an answer. What's it gonna be?

1229
02:05:47,957 --> 02:05:50,459
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1230
02:05:50,627 --> 02:05:53,795
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.

1231
02:05:53,963 --> 02:05:59,801
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life
and become a born-again good citizen.

1232
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:04,514
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1233
02:06:04,682 --> 02:06:07,434
Waingro used to be a part
of Neil's crew...

1234
02:06:07,602 --> 02:06:11,188
...then he went to work
for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1235
02:06:11,356 --> 02:06:17,152
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1236
02:06:17,487 --> 02:06:20,822
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else,
it's gonna be waingro.

1237
02:06:20,990 --> 02:06:24,326
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the airport Marquis. ..

1238
02:06:24,494 --> 02:06:27,871
...under the name "Jameson."
He's there now.

1239
02:06:28,039 --> 02:06:31,124
I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies.. .

1240
02:06:31,292 --> 02:06:34,503
...assignment officers
and snitches in County.

1241
02:06:34,671 --> 02:06:37,047
Anyone you can think of
who'll put it on the street.

1242
02:06:37,215 --> 02:06:41,385
Deploy a team at the hotel and personally
check their coms every 30 minutes.

1243
02:06:41,552 --> 02:06:45,639
Because maybe Neil will go for him.
Okay? How you feeling?

1244
02:06:46,349 --> 02:06:49,601
Banged up, but I'll live.
Okay.

1245
02:06:56,985 --> 02:06:58,860
He's here.

1246
02:06:59,153 --> 02:07:01,363
Neil is still here.

1247
02:07:01,906 --> 02:07:03,865
I can feel it.

1248
02:07:04,117 --> 02:07:06,660
But for how long?
Uh.. ..

1249
02:07:07,245 --> 02:07:10,163
Seven, eight hours, max.

1250
02:07:18,548 --> 02:07:19,881
EADY:
What did you do?

1251
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:24,303
That was you?
It's what I don't do, l don't sell metal.

1252
02:07:24,470 --> 02:07:27,389
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1253
02:07:27,557 --> 02:07:31,560
Now we gotta go together.
Those other people were with you?

1254
02:07:33,688 --> 02:07:35,814
My friend, Michael...

1255
02:07:36,899 --> 02:07:39,526
...he knew the risks.
He didn't have to be there.

1256
02:07:43,531 --> 02:07:46,158
It rains, you get wet.

1257
02:07:48,202 --> 02:07:49,411
Get packed and let's go.

1258
02:07:56,586 --> 02:07:59,254
Eady.

1259
02:08:09,015 --> 02:08:12,267
EADY:
Why did you do this to me?

1260
02:08:17,774 --> 02:08:19,816
Who are you?

1261
02:08:22,653 --> 02:08:25,781
NEIL: lt's gonna be all right.
You understand? It'll be all right.

1262
02:08:30,661 --> 02:08:32,788
It's gonna be all right.

1263
02:08:33,790 --> 02:08:35,415
Right.

1264
02:08:44,008 --> 02:08:47,636
There's this Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 1 8.

1265
02:08:52,350 --> 02:08:54,393
Here's some cash.

1266
02:08:56,979 --> 02:08:58,146
When's it over?

1267
02:09:01,651 --> 02:09:03,193
Twenty-two hours from now.

1268
02:09:03,653 --> 02:09:07,364
Then we get out of here clean.
When will you let me leave?

1269
02:09:11,285 --> 02:09:14,162
Go now. You want out? There's the door.

1270
02:09:14,831 --> 02:09:16,998
Will you let me leave later?

1271
02:09:22,088 --> 02:09:24,297
It will be different.

1272
02:09:25,341 --> 02:09:27,509
Do you understand?

1273
02:09:57,999 --> 02:09:59,541
It's ready.

1274
02:09:59,709 --> 02:10:01,543
Vincent.

1275
02:10:06,966 --> 02:10:09,134
This is my friend Ralph.

1276
02:10:09,302 --> 02:10:11,261
RALPH:
You didn't tell me you were... .

1277
02:10:12,346 --> 02:10:15,223
Oh, my God.
Where's Lauren?

1278
02:10:15,391 --> 02:10:18,602
She's at Lisa-Beth's.
Look, this has nothing to do with me.

1279
02:10:18,769 --> 02:10:22,689
I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry.
What are you sorry about? Sit down.

1280
02:10:23,357 --> 02:10:25,400
JUSTINE:
Don't you even get angry?

1281
02:10:25,568 --> 02:10:28,069
I'm angry, yeah.
Oh.

1282
02:10:28,237 --> 02:10:30,655
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1283
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:33,909
You know, you can ball my wife
if she wants you to.

1284
02:10:35,495 --> 02:10:38,580
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1285
02:10:39,916 --> 02:10:42,209
In her ex-husband's.. .

1286
02:10:42,376 --> 02:10:47,422
...dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house, if you want to. ..

1287
02:10:49,258 --> 02:10:55,597
...but you do not get to watch
my fucking television set!

1288
02:10:55,765 --> 02:10:57,265
JUSTINE:
For God's sake.

1289
02:11:03,814 --> 02:11:05,607
Put the television set down.

1290
02:11:05,775 --> 02:11:08,318
I never cheated on you, bitch.
Maybe you should have.

1291
02:11:08,486 --> 02:11:10,779
I should have?
In a way, you're a party to this.

1292
02:11:10,947 --> 02:11:13,990
Oh, yeah. I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1293
02:11:14,158 --> 02:11:15,325
Our situation is absurd.

1294
02:11:17,036 --> 02:11:21,873
Look, maybe l should--
Shut up, Ralph. Sit down!

1295
02:11:23,960 --> 02:11:27,879
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you? What do you do?

1296
02:11:28,047 --> 02:11:31,883
I say what I mean, and l do what I say.
Mm, how admirable.

1297
02:11:32,051 --> 02:11:34,135
You bet.
Except none of it's about us.

1298
02:11:34,971 --> 02:11:36,012
No.

1299
02:11:37,473 --> 02:11:41,059
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac.. .

1300
02:11:41,227 --> 02:11:43,853
...but you've been walking
through our life dead.

1301
02:11:44,021 --> 02:11:48,692
Now l have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1302
02:12:01,247 --> 02:12:03,498
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1303
02:12:04,166 --> 02:12:09,004
The plane, charter terminal, LAX,
Hangar 1 7.

1304
02:12:09,171 --> 02:12:10,922
Call letters are 1 01 1 Sierra.

1305
02:12:14,302 --> 02:12:18,013
Touches down, holds for you five minutes,
then splits.

1306
02:12:18,180 --> 02:12:21,683
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1307
02:12:23,686 --> 02:12:26,021
Hey, where's Chris?
He's gone.

1308
02:12:27,481 --> 02:12:28,523
What?

1309
02:12:29,150 --> 02:12:31,693
Said he's going on his own.
Went to look for Charlene.

1310
02:12:31,861 --> 02:12:34,696
Didn't you bring him here?
Yeah, l brought him here.

1311
02:12:35,156 --> 02:12:36,990
What happened?

1312
02:12:37,158 --> 02:12:39,534
It's a free country, brother.

1313
02:12:43,956 --> 02:12:48,376
Check in with me at 9.
Everything's still cool.

1314
02:12:49,712 --> 02:12:51,379
All right.

1315
02:13:13,944 --> 02:13:16,905
I don't even know
what l'm doing anymore.

1316
02:13:19,784 --> 02:13:21,993
I know life is short.

1317
02:13:22,244 --> 02:13:24,871
Whatever time you get is luck.

1318
02:13:27,083 --> 02:13:29,167
You wanna walk?

1319
02:13:31,420 --> 02:13:33,713
You walk right now.

1320
02:13:34,799 --> 02:13:36,925
Or on your own.. ..

1321
02:13:37,093 --> 02:13:40,136
On your own,
you choose to come with me.

1322
02:13:46,227 --> 02:13:48,269
All I know is... .

1323
02:13:50,064 --> 02:13:54,401
All I know is there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore. ..

1324
02:13:54,944 --> 02:13:57,028
...if it's gonna be alone...

1325
02:13:57,947 --> 02:13:59,739
...without you.

1326
02:14:06,580 --> 02:14:08,164
Eady.

1327
02:14:57,882 --> 02:15:00,341
Yeah.
Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1328
02:15:01,051 --> 02:15:02,677
Okay, l'll hold.

1329
02:15:05,347 --> 02:15:06,723
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1330
02:15:07,850 --> 02:15:09,684
Yeah, do it.
Shut up!

1331
02:15:13,939 --> 02:15:16,649
Now, just one second at the window...

1332
02:15:17,443 --> 02:15:19,194
...and it's all over.

1333
02:17:09,179 --> 02:17:10,847
CHRlS:
Hey, man.

1334
02:17:11,098 --> 02:17:13,057
Yeah?
You know any, uh. ..

1335
02:17:13,225 --> 02:17:16,019
...place to rent around here?

1336
02:17:17,104 --> 02:17:18,229
MAN:
Yeah.

1337
02:17:18,397 --> 02:17:20,982
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue
got cards on the wall.

1338
02:17:21,150 --> 02:17:22,191
CHRlS:
Yeah, thanks.

1339
02:17:33,412 --> 02:17:36,080
It's not him. lt's not Chris.

1340
02:17:43,756 --> 02:17:45,882
Unit 2, this is Command.

1341
02:17:46,050 --> 02:17:48,718
Take him at the street and check him out.

1342
02:17:48,886 --> 02:17:50,386
OFFICER:
1 0-4.

1343
02:18:13,827 --> 02:18:15,787
OFFICER : Sergeant?
Yeah.

1344
02:18:15,955 --> 02:18:18,539
This guy's John Peterson. Valid lD.

1345
02:18:18,707 --> 02:18:22,460
Car's registered to the last name Bukowski,
first name Gene.

1346
02:18:22,628 --> 02:18:25,505
Ran it to DMV. It's clean.

1347
02:18:28,217 --> 02:18:31,052
Let him go.
Roger.

1348
02:18:31,220 --> 02:18:33,554
Thank you very much.
Have a good evening.

1349
02:18:35,307 --> 02:18:37,266
It's a no-go, Vince.

1350
02:18:46,360 --> 02:18:49,153
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

1351
02:18:49,321 --> 02:18:51,406
Yeah, that'd be nice.

1352
02:19:21,395 --> 02:19:23,396
MAN : Yeah?
Yeah, what do you got?

1353
02:19:23,564 --> 02:19:25,648
MAN:
Nothing's happening.

1354
02:19:36,952 --> 02:19:40,288
Yeah?
Hello, it's Vincent.

1355
02:19:40,456 --> 02:19:41,456
What do you got?

1356
02:19:41,623 --> 02:19:45,960
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.
That's it.

1357
02:19:54,303 --> 02:19:56,137
You know what?

1358
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:00,183
Neil is gone.

1359
02:20:02,394 --> 02:20:04,020
Bam!

1360
02:20:04,605 --> 02:20:08,024
Flying like a bird.
Come on, Vincent, how do you know?

1361
02:20:10,319 --> 02:20:13,362
We still got bait. Maybe some time!
Got, got. What do we got?

1362
02:20:13,530 --> 02:20:15,364
What do we got?

1363
02:20:15,783 --> 02:20:18,451
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1364
02:20:19,161 --> 02:20:21,370
You were good.

1365
02:20:22,456 --> 02:20:23,998
I'm going to the hotel.

1366
02:20:25,417 --> 02:20:27,877
I'm gonna take a shower.

1367
02:20:28,462 --> 02:20:31,964
Gonna sleep for a month.

1368
02:22:41,887 --> 02:22:43,679
Over here.

1369
02:22:50,354 --> 02:22:52,271
Come on, baby.

1370
02:22:54,233 --> 02:22:56,525
Okay, okay.

1371
02:22:59,988 --> 02:23:01,948
Shit.

1372
02:23:02,824 --> 02:23:04,825
Let me tighten this.

1373
02:23:10,332 --> 02:23:12,333
What a fucking waste.

1374
02:23:12,501 --> 02:23:14,835
Okay, here.

1375
02:23:15,671 --> 02:23:21,384
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.
Not you, baby. Not you.

1376
02:23:26,223 --> 02:23:29,684
Where would she be?
Her name is Lauren, Lauren Gustafson.

1377
02:23:29,851 --> 02:23:32,103
I'm supposed to be here with her.
But the police--

1378
02:23:39,027 --> 02:23:42,196
Help me. l need somebody to help--
It's okay.

1379
02:23:43,657 --> 02:23:45,241
I got you.

1380
02:23:47,869 --> 02:23:49,036
I got you, baby.

1381
02:23:50,372 --> 02:23:53,708
It'll be all right, honey. l swear.
It's okay, baby.

1382
02:23:53,875 --> 02:23:57,920
Let's get a doctor! Let's go!
A doctor here! There's your mama.

1383
02:23:58,088 --> 02:23:59,964
Let's just calm down.
Your mama's here.

1384
02:24:00,132 --> 02:24:01,966
Is she on any drugs?
No.

1385
02:24:04,886 --> 02:24:07,680
I want you to get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1386
02:24:07,848 --> 02:24:11,100
I think she cut both arteries.
Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.

1387
02:24:11,268 --> 02:24:14,603
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1388
02:24:14,771 --> 02:24:16,480
NURSE: It's ready.
Oh--

1389
02:24:17,983 --> 02:24:21,152
When's the last time anybody saw her?
I don't know.

1390
02:24:21,320 --> 02:24:24,405
Where did you find her?
The bathtub.

1391
02:24:24,573 --> 02:24:28,117
Call Respiratory stat. Give her large-bore
normal saline. wide open.

1392
02:24:28,285 --> 02:24:31,412
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders.
I need two units, O-negative.

1393
02:24:31,580 --> 02:24:34,623
Let's type and cross her for six.
NURSE: Looks like she's in sinus tach.

1394
02:24:34,791 --> 02:24:36,667
DOCTOR:
Where is Respiratory? we need more help.

1395
02:24:36,835 --> 02:24:38,627
Can you have Respiratory come now?

1396
02:24:38,795 --> 02:24:41,505
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest x-ray.

1397
02:24:46,511 --> 02:24:51,140
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room now, okay?

1398
02:24:51,308 --> 02:24:55,478
Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will be
out to speak to you in a few moments.

1399
02:24:55,645 --> 02:24:57,521
She's okay?
She's doing good.

1400
02:24:57,689 --> 02:24:59,857
She's gonna be okay.
VINCENT: She's gonna be okay.

1401
02:25:00,025 --> 02:25:02,902
Oh, my baby.
She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1402
02:25:03,070 --> 02:25:06,197
It's all right.
Why'd she do this to herself? Why?

1403
02:25:06,365 --> 02:25:10,576
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1404
02:25:11,620 --> 02:25:13,454
There.

1405
02:25:13,872 --> 02:25:16,791
It's all right, honey.
It's gonna be all right.

1406
02:25:16,958 --> 02:25:19,001
I'm here. l ain't going anywhere.

1407
02:25:19,169 --> 02:25:20,211
You understand?
Yeah.

1408
02:25:20,379 --> 02:25:22,463
I ain't going anywhere.

1409
02:25:35,268 --> 02:25:36,102
Yeah?

1410
02:25:36,770 --> 02:25:37,770
It's me.

1411
02:25:38,355 --> 02:25:41,607
Plane's in the air now.
It'll be right on time.

1412
02:25:41,817 --> 02:25:45,820
On the driver's end, l still can't
find nobody, so that's in the trust.

1413
02:25:45,987 --> 02:25:47,863
One other thing.

1414
02:25:48,323 --> 02:25:49,907
You asked, so I gotta tell you.

1415
02:25:50,742 --> 02:25:53,619
The guy you wanted checked into
the Marquis under "Jameson"...

1416
02:25:53,787 --> 02:25:57,164
...if you still give a shit,
which I figured you wouldn't.

1417
02:25:57,332 --> 02:26:01,085
You figured right.
So, so long, brother.

1418
02:26:02,796 --> 02:26:04,755
You take it easy.

1419
02:26:04,923 --> 02:26:06,507
You're home free.

1420
02:26:08,260 --> 02:26:10,219
Take it easy.

1421
02:26:20,564 --> 02:26:23,315
What is it?
Nothing.

1422
02:26:23,483 --> 02:26:25,025
Home free.

1423
02:27:02,981 --> 02:27:05,900
I gotta take care of something.
Is there time?

1424
02:27:06,902 --> 02:27:08,569
There's time.

1425
02:27:36,973 --> 02:27:40,100
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1426
02:28:21,518 --> 02:28:23,978
WOMAN : Registration.
Yeah, this is Room Service.

1427
02:28:24,145 --> 02:28:27,982
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up
his room number. Could you give it to me?

1428
02:28:28,149 --> 02:28:30,025
They're always doing that.
Yeah, l know.

1429
02:28:30,193 --> 02:28:33,279
1 735.
Thank you.

1430
02:30:16,758 --> 02:30:18,467
WOMAN:
Your attention, please.

1431
02:30:18,635 --> 02:30:21,887
We are currently experiencing
a fire alarm.

1432
02:30:22,055 --> 02:30:25,432
Please do not panic.
Please do not take the elevators.

1433
02:30:29,437 --> 02:30:32,064
MAN: Shit.
Waingro's not moving. l'm staying here.

1434
02:30:32,232 --> 02:30:35,818
I'm checking the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.

1435
02:30:40,115 --> 02:30:42,533
What about her dad?
You want me to call him?

1436
02:30:43,535 --> 02:30:46,370
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1437
02:30:47,831 --> 02:30:49,998
And she chose you.

1438
02:30:52,001 --> 02:30:54,378
She picked your place.

1439
02:30:55,922 --> 02:30:57,381
It's not right, what happened to her.

1440
02:30:59,050 --> 02:31:00,384
No, it's not.

1441
02:31:03,805 --> 02:31:05,848
Ugh, okay.

1442
02:31:16,025 --> 02:31:18,152
Is there any way. ..

1443
02:31:20,113 --> 02:31:22,614
...that it could work out between us?

1444
02:31:24,993 --> 02:31:27,578
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1445
02:31:27,746 --> 02:31:31,039
But in the end.. ..

1446
02:31:35,503 --> 02:31:37,671
You know, it's like you said:

1447
02:31:40,383 --> 02:31:45,053
All I am, is what I'm going after.

1448
02:31:51,936 --> 02:31:54,855
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1449
02:32:05,325 --> 02:32:07,951
Well, go on, if you have to.

1450
02:32:08,119 --> 02:32:09,703
No.

1451
02:32:09,996 --> 02:32:13,207
I'll stay.
No, I'm okay. I can-- I can handle this.

1452
02:32:16,377 --> 02:32:18,378
Just be careful.

1453
02:32:18,630 --> 02:32:21,381
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1454
02:32:22,300 --> 02:32:23,842
Okay?

1455
02:33:05,718 --> 02:33:06,760
MAN:
Take the stairs.

1456
02:33:20,733 --> 02:33:21,775
Yeah?

1457
02:33:23,987 --> 02:33:28,156
Security. There's a fire on 3.
We have to evacuate all the floors.

1458
02:33:28,324 --> 02:33:29,950
I can't leave here.

1459
02:33:38,835 --> 02:33:42,254
Why don't we just talk about this a bit,
huh, brother?

1460
02:33:56,269 --> 02:33:57,311
He's here on 1 7.

1461
02:34:00,481 --> 02:34:02,816
Look at me. Look at me.

1462
02:34:06,154 --> 02:34:07,321
Look at me.

1463
02:34:39,228 --> 02:34:43,106
L.A.P.D. Don't move.
Put your hands on your head, now.

1464
02:35:18,226 --> 02:35:20,560
VINCENT:
Switch me to TAC 5.

1465
02:35:20,728 --> 02:35:23,063
Casals? JJ?

1466
02:35:23,982 --> 02:35:25,190
Drucker, JJ?

1467
02:35:25,358 --> 02:35:27,901
CASALS:
I'm at the lobby level by the stairwell.

1468
02:35:28,069 --> 02:35:29,069
What have you got?

1469
02:35:29,237 --> 02:35:32,406
CASALS: Teams are moving up the other
elevators to the 1 7th floor elevators.

1470
02:35:32,573 --> 02:35:34,741
All out of commission
because of the fire alarm.

1471
02:35:34,909 --> 02:35:38,036
It's a mess. People everywhere.
Fine. 1 0-4.

1472
02:36:07,859 --> 02:36:09,443
OFFICER 1 :
Let's go, get out of the way.

1473
02:36:09,610 --> 02:36:11,528
Stay out of the way.

1474
02:36:19,454 --> 02:36:22,497
Let's go. Go that way.
We gotta go, all right? Go, go.

1475
02:36:25,626 --> 02:36:27,544
OFFICER 2:
I got it, sir.

1476
02:36:29,672 --> 02:36:31,590
Come on, come on.

1477
02:36:37,430 --> 02:36:39,056
Come on, sir.

1478
02:36:43,311 --> 02:36:46,313
OFFICER 1 : Watch your backs, ladies.
OFFICER 2: l got it, l got it.

1479
02:36:48,983 --> 02:36:50,650
OFFICER 3:
Keep moving, ma'am.

1480
02:36:51,486 --> 02:36:52,569
OFFICER 4:
Let's go.

1481
02:36:55,073 --> 02:36:56,323
OFFICER 1 :
Come on, let's go.

1482
02:37:30,942 --> 02:37:32,609
OFFICER 2:
This way, ma'am.

1483
02:37:34,570 --> 02:37:36,363
Get back, get back.

1484
02:38:02,223 --> 02:38:04,641
Let me have that shotgun.
Yes, sir.

1485
02:44:22,102 --> 02:44:24,854
Told you I'm never going back.

1486
02:44:28,192 --> 02:44:29,817
Yeah.
