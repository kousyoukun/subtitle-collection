1
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,100
Check, charge or cash?

2
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,300
Cash.

3
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,000
Make it out to...

4
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,900
Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

5
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,900
$788.30.

6
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,600
Taking me to breakfast?

7
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,500
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

8
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,100
Hey, Vincent.

9
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,700
Where are my barrettes?

10
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,900
I saw them on the kitchen table.

11
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,500
I already checked.

12
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Coffee?

13
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
No school today?

14
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,300
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

15
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,100
Try under the sofa cushions.

16
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,700
He's already half an hour late.

17
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,300
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

18
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,800
I'll make coffee.

19
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,200
Out of time.

20
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,900
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

21
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,500
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,500
I don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

23
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,300
- Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere!

24
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,700
What do you want me to do?

25
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,900
Find them!

26
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,800
- Mom, pay attention!
- All right, sweetie, all right!

27
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,700
Daddy's going to be here.

28
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,900
I won't be ready!

29
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,500
- I can't be late.
- You won't.

30
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,200
I will be late!

31
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,300
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

32
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,900
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

33
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,900
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

34
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,700
Just relax. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

35
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,300
Give me another refill.

36
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,700
What's your name?

37
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,000
Waingro.

38
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,700
You're Michael?

39
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,400
You guys always work together?

40
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,400
All the time.

41
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,100
Real tight crew?

42
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,300
Real tight.

43
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,700
If this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,300
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,800
How's he doing?

46
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,200
Hundred percent.

47
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,500
Right on schedule.

48
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:17,900
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

49
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,400
<i>We're a mile and a half from you.</i>

50
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay.

51
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,200
Just crossed over the No. 1 lane,
300 yards from you.

52
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,900
Get set.

53
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,100
I am.

54
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
Here we go.

55
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,300
211!

56
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,000
We're being held up!

57
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,000
<i>- 211 alarm. Armored car.</i>
- There's the call.

58
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,100
<i>Three minutes.</i>

59
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,600
Clear!

60
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,800
Eighty seconds left!

61
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,200
Get back! Get back!

62
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,100
Get back!

63
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,100
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

64
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,300
Cool it!

65
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,100
I got it.

66
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:43,700
Got it.

67
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
You had to fuck with me.

68
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,600
Want to fuck with me?

69
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,600
What are you doing? What did he do?

70
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,100
He was making a move.

71
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,600
Dumb motherfucker.

72
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,500
I heard them.

73
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,200
$1.6 million...

74
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,600
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

75
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,700
Here's $150,000 front money.

76
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,500
Get you the rest in two, three days.

77
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,100
Who owned these?

78
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,900
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

79
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:41,900
Roger Van Zant.

80
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,700
Owns banks in the Caymans...

81
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,600
runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

82
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
So?

83
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,900
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

84
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,100
He's insured.

85
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:56,000
That's the point. He collects
100% from the insurance.

86
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,600
He's a player. Maybe he buys
his bonds back from us...

87
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,600
for 60% of their value.
Makes 40% on top of the 100%.

88
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:07,500
Sell it back to him,
that's an extra $320,000 to you.

89
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,300
Try it on.

90
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,300
Kelso called.

91
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,500
About what?

92
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,400
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

93
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,800
I don't need his score. I got my own.

94
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,200
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

95
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,900
9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

96
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,300
What happened?

97
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,800
Don't ask.

98
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Find the ambulance?

99
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street.

100
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,700
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

101
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,100
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

102
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,600
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

103
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,600
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.

104
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,300
You taking this one?

105
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:25,600
Or does it stay in Division?

106
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,100
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-11 to you?

107
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

108
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
We got three motorists.

109
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,500
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

110
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,000
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

111
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,900
Did he ID anybody?

112
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,400
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

113
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:48,200
What about them?

114
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:52,000
According to the TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

115
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,200
Smart.

116
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,300
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

117
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,100
Now, I figure this guy...

118
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:01,200
went for that hold-out piece, ankle holster.

119
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
From here...

120
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,500
bang, bang...

121
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
bang, bang, bang.

122
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,400
This side.

123
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:12,100
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

124
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,500
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bone, close range.

125
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,700
Probably executed.

126
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,200
It was $1.6 million in bearer bonds.

127
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,000
They ignored the loose cash.

128
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,800
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

129
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,600
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

130
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,500
had our air, immobilized it, entered...

131
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
escaped in under three minutes.

132
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,000
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

133
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,300
Two freeways...

134
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,900
within a quarter of a mile.

135
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,200
Traffic video camera?

136
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,500
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

137
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,100
You recognize the M. O?

138
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,300
M. O...

139
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,900
is that they're good.

140
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:52,300
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

141
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,700
they didn't hesitate.

142
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,600
Popped guard No. 3 because...
what difference does it make?

143
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,600
Why leave a living witness?

144
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,600
Drop of a hat,
these guys will rock-and-roll.

145
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,100
The shape charge.

146
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:11,000
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

147
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,200
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

148
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,500
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that have mystified us.

149
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,100
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You'll get the phone book.

150
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,900
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

151
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,700
Check the usual fences. You and I will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

152
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,100
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

153
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,600
Hang in with Forensics.

154
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,300
From the bomb squad,
I want the explosive.

155
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:37,200
If we're lucky, it's exotic.
We can trace the sale.

156
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

157
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,600
Anyone want some pie?

158
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,300
Gotta go to the john.

159
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,600
I had to get it on. He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

160
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,600
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

161
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
to make up for his full end...

162
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:58,500
'cause I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

163
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Hold it!

164
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,900
Where's the rest?

165
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,700
We're late. You look too good to go out.

166
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,900
I'll just jump you right here.

167
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:24,800
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

168
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.

169
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Come on.

170
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,800
You gotta be kidding me.

171
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,500
Honey...

172
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:38,200
it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

173
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,400
Let's go.

174
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,800
Get your coat.

175
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,700
There's no point talking.
You're just a child growing older.

176
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,100
What does that mean?

177
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:51,300
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

178
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,500
because I married a gambling junkie.

179
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,700
Get in the fucking car.

180
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,100
What am I doing in here?

181
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,500
You're not!

182
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,200
Leave the bank book and the car keys...

183
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,900
in the kitchen on your way out!

184
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,700
- Are we going?
- Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

185
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,400
Don't even think about...

186
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,700
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

187
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:41,300
Albert Torena call Vincent?

188
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,700
No.

189
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:45,100
Report came in.

190
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,300
<i>The explosive was Dy-Ex,</i>
<i>used in demolition.</i>

191
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,400
<i>You can pick it up in Nevada...</i>

192
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,100
Arizona, New Mexico.

193
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,100
Too common to trace a sale.

194
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,900
That's wonderful.

195
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,300
You all right?

196
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
What happened? Where have you been?

197
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,500
Work.

198
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,500
Lauren's dad show up?

199
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,100
Didn't call...

200
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:28,900
didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

201
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,000
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

202
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,600
I don't know.

203
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,900
Fucking jerk.

204
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,800
Is she okay?

205
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,800
She's been in her room all day.

206
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,500
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

207
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,500
I made dinner...

208
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,800
for us, four hours ago.

209
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,400
Every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...

210
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,800
you withdraw.

211
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,200
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

212
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,600
off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

213
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,100
I'm sorry...

214
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,200
if the goddamn...

215
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,100
chicken...

216
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,400
got overcooked.

217
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,900
Coffee, sir?

218
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,100
Please.

219
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,100
Will you pass the cream?

220
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,700
Thanks.

221
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,900
What'd you get?

222
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,100
What?

223
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,500
What are you reading?

224
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,300
Book about metals.

225
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,800
<i>Stress Fractures in Titanium.</i>

226
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,700
What kind of work do you do?

227
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,800
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

228
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,700
I've seen you in the store.

229
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,100
What store?

230
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,400
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

231
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,600
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

232
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,400
I'm sorry I bothered you.

233
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

234
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,400
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

235
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,000
My name's Neil.

236
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,300
I'm Eady.

237
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,500
You like working there?

238
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,300
Sure.

239
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,500
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

240
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:40,700
What area?

241
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,600
Graphic design.

242
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,400
I do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

243
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,900
the store's a day job
until I get enough going.

244
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,600
Who do you do that for?

245
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,900
A restaurant.

246
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,300
I did their menus, and...

247
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,900
a small record label.

248
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,100
CDs.

249
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,300
I've done two so far.

250
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,100
You go to school for that?

251
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Yeah.

252
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,000
I went to Parsons.

253
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,300
Where's that?

254
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,700
New York City.

255
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,000
How long you been here?

256
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,300
About a year.

257
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,400
Like it?

258
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,900
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

259
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,900
Live in this neighborhood?

260
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,600
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

261
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,800
It's a little house I rent.

262
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,400
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

263
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,100
What about you?

264
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,400
I live up here.

265
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,900
That's very funny.

266
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,300
Where's your family from originally?

267
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,400
They're Scotch-Irish.

268
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,300
They emigrated to Appalachia...

269
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,300
in the late 1700s.

270
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,300
Where are you from?

271
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,300
The Bay area.

272
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,000
Your folks there?

273
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,300
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...

274
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,900
I don't know where he is.

275
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,600
Got a brother somewhere.

276
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,100
You have a tight family. I can tell.

277
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,400
Right?

278
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:37,900
You're right.

279
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:48,900
City of lights.

280
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,600
In Fiji, they have...

281
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:57,300
iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

282
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,500
That's what it looks like out there.

283
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,000
You been there?

284
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,100
No, I'm going there someday.

285
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,100
You travel a lot?

286
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Yeah.

287
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:22,000
Traveling make you lonely?

288
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,800
I'm alone. I am not...

289
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,500
lonely.

290
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,900
You?

291
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,700
Real lonely.

292
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,800
Albert!

293
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
Shit!

294
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,900
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

295
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
You were supposed to get back to me.

296
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,900
Where the fuck you been?

297
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,300
I couldn't break free.

298
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,400
Let's violate his ass right now.

299
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,000
I do for you...

300
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,500
you don't do for me, is that it?

301
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:01,500
Vincent, man. I swear, I was out all night.
I'm hitting like a Flamingo matador.

302
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,900
That's got nothing to do with me.

303
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:08,500
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating
leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

304
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,900
You bullshit.

305
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,500
I paged your ass all day.
I hate fucking paging.

306
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,000
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

307
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,900
Where's your empathy?
It's a substance abuse problem.

308
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,500
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.

309
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,100
You fall in love?

310
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,100
Did you fall in love...

311
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,000
and went off somewhere?

312
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:30,200
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

313
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,600
Give me all you got!

314
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,600
Give me all you got!

315
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:39,500
I swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

316
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,100
I heard Richard?

317
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,500
He's going to talk to you.

318
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,700
He's gonna meet you tonight.

319
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:48,300
He's not here, is he?

320
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,700
No, he'll meet you tonight.

321
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,300
What happened to now?

322
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,200
I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

323
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,300
Bullshit.

324
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,500
I swear. He said no...

325
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,600
'cause he in Phoenix.

326
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,900
<i>By the time I get to Phoenix</i>

327
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,200
<i>He'll be rising</i>

328
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,500
<i>He'll probably leave a note</i>

329
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,400
<i>Right on the door</i>

330
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

331
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:17,700
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

332
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,800
At 2:00 a.m.

333
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:20,900
Be there.

334
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,600
You be there, too.

335
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,400
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

336
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,300
I got things to do, I got places to be.

337
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
Be there.

338
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,500
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

339
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,700
What is it?

340
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,600
It's a bank.

341
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:50,300
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

342
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,400
to cover Friday payroll checks.

343
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:55,600
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

344
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,100
On the prowl or strong?

345
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,300
Strong. Through the door.

346
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,500
How many guys?

347
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,200
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

348
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,600
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

349
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,000
Sounds like a cowboy score.

350
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:12,600
They hit the hold-up alarms,
I gotta get out before the cops show.

351
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,600
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

352
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,600
Two Telco and a cellular.

353
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,200
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

354
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,000
the night before...

355
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,500
you cut in...

356
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,200
and trick out the alarm system computer...

357
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,600
to turn itself...

358
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,700
and the video recorders off...

359
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,900
20 minutes before you enter.

360
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,300
Architectural, electrical plans?

361
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
I got that.

362
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,500
I got the boards already built.
They go right into the CPU.

363
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,200
What's the estimate?

364
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:48,500
$12.1, $12.2 million.

365
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
You're on.

366
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,800
Congratulations.

367
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,900
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

368
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,300
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

369
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,400
My way, you get 100%
from the insurance company...

370
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,300
take the bonds back from us...

371
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,800
<i>at 60 cents on the dollar</i>
<i>and make yourself another 40%.</i>

372
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,300
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

373
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,800
Sure, you got a deal.

374
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,800
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

375
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,000
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

376
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,400
Yeah, okay.

377
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,600
Nice talking to you.

378
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,200
You gonna deal with these guys?

379
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,000
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

380
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,500
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

381
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,700
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Island's Offshore.

382
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,200
That's not really an estimate.
Those are exact figures.

383
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,400
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

384
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,100
How'd you get this information?

385
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,500
Just comes to you.

386
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,000
This stuff just flies through the air.

387
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,500
It's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.

388
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,200
I know how to grab it.

389
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,400
Okay, here we go.

390
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,300
$13.9 million.

391
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:14,200
- I bought it.
- Good.

392
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,100
What did I tell you?

393
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,700
Here.

394
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,600
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

395
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,900
How is he?

396
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:28,700
He's a businessman.

397
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,500
Chris is at my place.

398
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,900
What's wrong?

399
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:13,000
Husband-and-wife stuff.

400
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:15,300
I'll let him sleep it off.

401
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,500
What happened to you?

402
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,500
When will you get some furniture?

403
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,200
When I get around to it.

404
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,600
Charlene's gonna leave me.

405
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:45,900
Why?

406
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

407
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
With everything we've been doing?

408
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,500
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

409
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,200
When you gonna get an old lady?

410
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,900
When I get around to it.

411
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:06,300
You got something else on the side?

412
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,000
Nothing regular.

413
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,000
She got something else on the side?

414
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,400
- No.
- You sure?

415
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,900
Yeah, I'm sure.

416
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,900
I don't know what you're doing.

417
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,300
As Jimmy said, "You want to be
making moves on the street?

418
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:28,700
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

419
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:33,300
"that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

420
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,800
Remember that?

421
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,200
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

422
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,900
We take the delivery of cash
from Van Zant...

423
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,900
then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

424
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,400
Bank? What bank?

425
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:07,500
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

426
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,500
That goes, too. Then the bank.

427
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,800
Want some breakfast?

428
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,300
Are you okay?

429
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,000
Yeah, sugar.

430
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,300
For real.

431
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,500
I'll do good.

432
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,100
I'll see you later.

433
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,700
You Solenko?

434
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
I'm Don Breedan.

435
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,300
Grierson, my parole officer, told me
to come here, see if you had a job for me.

436
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,600
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

437
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,300
I'm a great grill man.

438
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:03,800
Good. Good for you.

439
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,800
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

440
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:11,200
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.

441
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,100
I'll violate you back fast.

442
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,900
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

443
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,100
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

444
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,900
What are you waiting for?

445
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,500
<i>Malibu Equity and Investments.</i>

446
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,100
Roger Van Zant.

447
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,300
<i>Please hold.</i>

448
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,700
<i>This is Roger Van Zant.</i>

449
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,900
I'm supposed to collect something.

450
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,800
Someone will call you back
from another line.

451
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,000
818-133-6089.

452
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,300
<i>I got a package for you. There's a drive-in</i>
<i>on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.</i>

453
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,500
Just send one man, alone.

454
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,100
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

455
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,900
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

456
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,200
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?

457
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,400
He's nobody, Neil.

458
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:12,900
He's a legit liquor wholesaler
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

459
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,700
Chris will make up.

460
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,300
- It's too late! I'm sick of it!
- Shut up!

461
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,200
Here's the deal.
You'll give Chris one last shot.

462
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,100
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

463
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,400
on my own, anywhere you want.

464
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,100
Dominick will go with you.

465
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,500
And my word counts. But right now...

466
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,100
you will give him the chance.

467
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:40,700
Clean up. Go home.

468
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,600
Clean up. Go home!

469
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,000
Give me all your money.

470
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,100
You'll get smoked with that shit.

471
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,300
Won't be you.

472
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,300
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

473
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,400
Vincent, hey, man.

474
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:13,700
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

475
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,300
It's all right.

476
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,300
What have you got for me?

477
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,800
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

478
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,900
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

479
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,100
if somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

480
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,200
they might find two Turbos
and a 911 Slope.

481
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,700
You're looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

482
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,500
I'm a good citizen.

483
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,100
I'm Donald Duck.

484
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,100
You got something to tell me?

485
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,400
Check this out, cuz.

486
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,500
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

487
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:54,000
that you're gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done.

488
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:56,400
Hanna is straight up.

489
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,300
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

490
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,700
And you know because I say so...

491
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,900
after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

492
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:06,100
Fuck you.

493
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,400
You understand?

494
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,600
I can get killed for telling you this.

495
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:11,800
You can get killed walking your doggie!

496
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,200
All right, man...

497
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:16,000
there was a cat I was locked up with.

498
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:20,300
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. I ran into him.

499
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,200
And so?

500
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,200
He's a big fiend for action.

501
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,800
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing, but...

502
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:34,100
he goes on and on,
telling me how he ain't done nothing...

503
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,900
and nothing's been going on,
and all this bullshit.

504
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,900
Right then and there I know...

505
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,000
this cat's got something going down.

506
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,900
Pretty fucking great.

507
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,700
Albert, what's wrong with you?

508
00:45:55,400 --> 00:45:58,700
You drag me here,
waste my time like this.

509
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,700
You saw a guy on the street
who's an ex-con?

510
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:02,900
That's right.

511
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,400
Well, I am...

512
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,200
over-fucking-whelmed.

513
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:09,000
What do you want for that,
a junior G-man badge?

514
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,600
You gonna make the call
on them Porsches?

515
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:13,800
Is he kidding me?

516
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,100
I'm telling you:

517
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:17,700
This Slick is no joke.

518
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,600
He's double time.

519
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:20,900
Say what?

520
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,500
"Slick." What does that mean?

521
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,900
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

522
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:29,100
Tell me about him.

523
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,000
About 6 feet tall...

524
00:46:33,300 --> 00:46:35,100
lots of jailhouse tats.

525
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:37,300
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

526
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,100
What's his name?

527
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,300
Cheritto.

528
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,000
Michael Cheritto.

529
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:52,200
<i>Thirty-three busts since 1976.</i>

530
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:54,700
<i>Eleven for armed robbery,</i>
<i>three convictions.</i>

531
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,400
<i>Two out of a three-to-five year beef</i>
<i>in Attica.</i>

532
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:58,700
Three years in Marion.

533
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,900
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

534
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,200
<i>Jacket's two inches thick.</i>

535
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,200
Who do I have there now?

536
00:47:05,300 --> 00:47:07,900
- Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
<i>- Tell SIS...</i>

537
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,700
I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

538
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,900
We never close. Open every day.

539
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,900
<i>Bug the car, the house, the work.</i>

540
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,100
<i>When he moves or sits,</i>
<i>like in a restaurant...</i>

541
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:20,600
<i>I want pictures of who he moves</i>
<i>and sits with.</i>

542
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,900
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

543
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,700
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

544
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,100
Put your hands where I can see them.

545
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,400
Put your hands where I can see them.

546
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,500
I tell you what to do.

547
00:48:26,700 --> 00:48:28,300
I tell you how to do it.

548
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,400
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

549
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,300
take the package and throw it in here.

550
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,500
Behind you.

551
00:48:54,700 --> 00:48:55,800
<i>On the right.</i>

552
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:13,300
Roger Van Zant.

553
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:14,900
Who's this?

554
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,800
You know who this is.

555
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,900
Yes, I do.

556
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:21,300
<i>I sent a guy to deliver the package.</i>

557
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:23,500
He didn't call. Is everything okay?

558
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,500
<i>I tell you what, forget the money.</i>

559
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:28,000
What?

560
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,300
Forget the money.

561
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,600
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "Forget the money"?

562
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,500
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

563
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,700
I don't understand.

564
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,300
'Cause there is a dead man
on the other end of this line.

565
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,900
Do you like it?

566
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,300
Look at my ring.

567
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:14,700
Did you know?

568
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,600
You are insane.

569
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:23,700
Do you like it?

570
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,700
- It's beautiful.
- It's good.

571
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:27,700
Don't ask him where he got it.

572
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:38,400
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

573
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,900
I don't know.

574
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:44,200
Just like me.

575
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:45,700
I don't know either.

576
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:00,700
Hello?

577
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:02,600
It's me.

578
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,200
I was wondering if you'd call.

579
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,100
I've been busy.

580
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,600
Can I see you?

581
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,900
I was afraid that was just...

582
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,300
the one night.

583
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,100
Not for me, it wasn't.

584
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:22,000
Yeah, me neither.

585
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,500
Can I fall by?

586
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,900
Yeah.

587
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:29,900
I'll see you in a little bit.

588
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,000
Goddamn convention.

589
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:49,300
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

590
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,300
We got two transmitters.

591
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:54,200
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

592
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:55,300
Here we are.

593
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,300
Did you say goodnight to Neil?

594
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,900
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

595
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,400
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

596
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:08,800
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

597
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:11,100
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

598
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:14,600
Sammy and I think that will be
their next score.

599
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:16,000
Who's the loner?

600
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,500
First time we've seen him.

601
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,100
We're not on him yet.

602
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,400
Get on it.

603
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:47,000
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take next...

604
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:51,900
they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

605
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,500
Baby, time to go.

606
00:54:10,100 --> 00:54:12,400
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

607
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:16,900
You fly.

608
00:54:17,100 --> 00:54:18,300
You're cool.

609
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,100
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

610
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,300
I ain't lying.

611
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,400
You're a hot dog.

612
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,700
A regular rodeo rider.

613
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:39,300
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

614
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:46,300
Now, I got to get my ass
street-side, sugar.

615
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:48,500
You don't have a truth-telling style.

616
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,500
What are you talking about?

617
00:54:50,700 --> 00:54:52,700
You don't know what this is.

618
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,300
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

619
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,600
Where have you been?

620
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,700
SHU at Pelican Bay.

621
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:25,700
Folsom, B-wing.

622
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:28,100
I am a cowboy...

623
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,700
looking for anything heavy.

624
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,900
Billy said to come see you.

625
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,300
That is why I am here.

626
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,600
Why don't you call this guy?

627
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:49,700
This guy's always putting guys on.

628
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:54,700
Thank you.

629
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,300
You're perfect for each other.

630
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,700
I knew a guy in grade school.

631
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:20,300
His name was Raoul... whatever.

632
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,800
You could take his fingers
and fold them over each other.

633
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,100
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

634
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,000
I can't keep my hands off you.
That's the truth.

635
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:33,000
That's what's so wonderful
about you in that...

636
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:34,700
bestial sort of way.

637
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,300
Woman.

638
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,600
This better be earth-shattering.

639
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,600
This is to Raoul.

640
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,500
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

641
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,800
Here's how we found her.

642
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,700
How old?

643
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,800
Sixteen, seventeen.
Been here about six hours.

644
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,900
How'd she die?

645
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:56,300
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

646
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,200
Who's that?

647
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:01,900
Mother and siblings.

648
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:03,800
- Why are they here?
- It's fucked up.

649
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,700
Somebody inside knew the girl
and called the family.

650
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:08,900
Let's go.

651
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,500
Nice.

652
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:19,200
My intuition says the DNA check on
the semen will show it's the same guy...

653
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,200
so it's a series and ending up
in your court.

654
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,100
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

655
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:25,300
Not yet.

656
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:28,100
Get off of me!

657
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:32,100
Oh, my God!

658
00:58:36,300 --> 00:58:37,400
Where is she?

659
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:39,200
Easy, easy, easy.

660
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:43,700
Please, come on.

661
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,300
It's okay.

662
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:50,900
Where is my baby?

663
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,200
Where is she?

664
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:55,100
I need to know what happened.

665
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,700
I guess the earth shattered.

666
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:41,100
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

667
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,100
I didn't want to ruin their night, too.

668
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:46,800
What was it?

669
00:59:48,900 --> 00:59:50,300
You don't want to know.

670
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,100
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

671
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,500
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

672
00:59:56,200 --> 00:59:58,800
You never told me I'd be excluded.

673
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,800
I told you when we hooked up...

674
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:05,100
that you'd have to share me...

675
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,700
with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

676
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,000
And I bought into that sharing...

677
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,800
because I love you.

678
01:00:13,300 --> 01:00:16,800
I love you fat, bald, money,
no money, driving a bus.

679
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:18,100
I don't care.

680
01:00:19,300 --> 01:00:21,900
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy.

681
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,900
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

682
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,900
What I should do is come home and say:

683
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:31,800
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

684
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,700
"where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

685
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:39,100
"because he was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

686
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,900
"Come on, let's share that
and in sharing it...

687
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:46,900
"we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

688
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,200
Right?

689
01:00:50,500 --> 01:00:51,600
Wrong.

690
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:52,800
You know why?

691
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:55,000
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

692
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,300
We fuck and you don't speak.

693
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,400
'Cause I got to hold on to my angst.

694
01:01:00,100 --> 01:01:01,400
I preserve it...

695
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,800
because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

696
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,500
Where I gotta be.

697
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,200
You don't live with me.

698
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,200
You live among the remains
of dead people.

699
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,100
You sift through the detritus.

700
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,200
You read the terrain.

701
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:32,700
You search for signs of passing...

702
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,300
for the scent of your prey...

703
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,300
and then you hunt them down.

704
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:41,500
That's the only thing you're committed to.

705
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:47,300
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

706
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,900
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

707
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,300
Let's go, baby.

708
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,600
I met the manager.

709
01:02:21,000 --> 01:02:22,400
Is that the boss?

710
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:26,300
I did time for what that motherfucker
does every day.

711
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,000
Can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

712
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,500
Can you do that?

713
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,300
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

714
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:45,000
Why're you hanging with me?

715
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,600
Because I'm proud of you.

716
01:02:54,300 --> 01:02:55,700
You're proud of me?

717
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,500
Why the hell are you proud of me?

718
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,300
Come on home.

719
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,300
What were you doing there?

720
01:03:17,600 --> 01:03:18,900
I was skiing.

721
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,900
I was trying to ski.

722
01:03:21,700 --> 01:03:24,500
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

723
01:03:25,300 --> 01:03:27,000
and you meet people.

724
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,800
You try to have a good time.

725
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,500
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

726
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,700
Why not?

727
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,900
I'm not good at meeting people.

728
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:35,700
You met me.

729
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,800
That happened without my thinking
about it.

730
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,100
Which is why I probably...

731
01:03:41,700 --> 01:03:43,700
No, it's because you are fine.

732
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,700
Take off with me for a while.

733
01:03:52,100 --> 01:03:53,100
Where?

734
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:54,800
New Zealand.

735
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,100
When?

736
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,200
I have to go separate.
You can meet me there.

737
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,100
But my job...

738
01:04:03,300 --> 01:04:05,300
I got money. You don't need money.

739
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,700
You could set up a studio and work there.

740
01:04:08,200 --> 01:04:09,300
I don't know.

741
01:04:09,400 --> 01:04:10,900
What's there to know?

742
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,400
Are you married?

743
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:15,100
What?

744
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,100
The last thing I am is married.

745
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,100
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way.

746
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:21,900
Then, all of a sudden...

747
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,700
someone like you comes along.

748
01:04:28,100 --> 01:04:29,200
You don't know me.

749
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:30,700
I know enough.

750
01:04:34,600 --> 01:04:35,900
Come with me.

751
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:46,700
What's wrong?

752
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:51,100
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

753
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,900
Yeah.

754
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:01,500
Good.

755
01:05:25,400 --> 01:05:26,700
Hi, sweetie.

756
01:05:28,100 --> 01:05:30,500
You forget your mom was picking you up?

757
01:05:32,100 --> 01:05:33,200
No.

758
01:05:35,100 --> 01:05:36,700
So, what's going on?

759
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:40,200
I felt like being alone.

760
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:44,800
Come on, I'll drive you home.

761
01:06:39,300 --> 01:06:40,400
What's happening?

762
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:43,200
Sir.

763
01:06:43,300 --> 01:06:45,800
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

764
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,300
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

765
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,000
Technique.

766
01:08:00,800 --> 01:08:02,600
Open Sesame. Right there.

767
01:08:58,100 --> 01:08:59,400
There he is.

768
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,000
We walk!

769
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:01,200
I'm there.

770
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,400
We walk! Now!

771
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:18,100
He's heard it.

772
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:27,400
Heads up.

773
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,000
- One's coming out.
- Hold it, Captain.

774
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,300
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

775
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:34,500
I see.

776
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,800
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

777
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,100
Both of them are not carrying anything.

778
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:52,500
- Let them go.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

779
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:53,600
<i>We can take them...</i>

780
01:10:53,700 --> 01:10:54,700
On what?

781
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,700
They didn't steal anything yet.

782
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:01,500
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor,
they do six months and they're out.

783
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:02,800
No fucking way.

784
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:06,000
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They are not walking.

785
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:09,500
That's exactly what they'll do.
They'll walk. This is my operation.

786
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,300
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

787
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:15,400
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck!

788
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:00,800
Back to work.

789
01:12:02,700 --> 01:12:06,100
LAPD, the G, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

790
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,600
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us.

791
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:12,100
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

792
01:12:12,300 --> 01:12:16,200
Assume they got our phones, our houses,
that they got us right here, right now...

793
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:18,700
as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

794
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,100
How will we buy the bank package?

795
01:12:21,200 --> 01:12:22,700
I'll front that.

796
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,400
What about Van Zant?

797
01:12:24,700 --> 01:12:28,500
With the heat we got, you want to play
World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

798
01:12:28,600 --> 01:12:30,000
No, I want my 750.

799
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,600
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

800
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,300
Our problem is to take the bank,
or split right now.

801
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:39,800
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

802
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:44,200
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone
on our separate ways. That's it.

803
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,000
The bank is worth the risk.

804
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:52,600
I need it, brother.

805
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:57,300
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

806
01:13:07,900 --> 01:13:09,900
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

807
01:13:10,300 --> 01:13:12,000
- Whatever.
- Not on this one.

808
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,000
On this one, you're on your own.

809
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:28,400
You figure this is the best thing to do?

810
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,700
This is the best thing to do?

811
01:13:30,800 --> 01:13:34,800
I've got plans, I'm going away after,
so the reward is worth the stretch.

812
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:37,700
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

813
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,500
You got T-bonds, real estate.

814
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,300
If I were you, I would be smart
and cut loose of this.

815
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:01,600
For me...

816
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,700
the action is the juice.

817
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:05,400
I'm in.

818
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,200
Yeah, sure.

819
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:13,500
Let's go.

820
01:14:14,400 --> 01:14:16,100
Fuck them, let's do it.

821
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,300
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

822
01:14:35,200 --> 01:14:36,900
Tim, I gotta call you back.

823
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:39,400
- Can I help you?
- Are you Alan Marciano?

824
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:40,900
Who the fuck are you?

825
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,100
Who am I?

826
01:14:42,800 --> 01:14:44,900
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

827
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:48,300
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

828
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:53,200
Do you know who you're pushing around?
I know people here.

829
01:14:53,300 --> 01:14:56,100
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

830
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,500
You are extradited to Newark
on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

831
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:03,600
up from North Carolina three years ago...

832
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:05,600
or you go to work for us.

833
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,500
Cut and dried.

834
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:09,200
That is it.

835
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:10,500
Shit.

836
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,100
Charlene Shiherlis.

837
01:15:13,300 --> 01:15:14,300
Who?

838
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:15,400
Who?

839
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,500
What are you, a fucking owl?

840
01:15:17,700 --> 01:15:21,400
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

841
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:23,400
You can't tie me to her.

842
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:27,500
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jackoff.

843
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,300
Why did I get mixed up with her?

844
01:15:31,500 --> 01:15:34,400
Because she's got a great ass!

845
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:38,100
And you got your head all the way up it.

846
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:40,100
Jesus.

847
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:42,100
Ferocious, aren't I?

848
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:44,300
When I think of asses...

849
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:45,800
a woman's ass...

850
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,100
something comes out of me.

851
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:50,100
So?

852
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:51,800
So, no big thing.

853
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:53,900
All I want...

854
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,800
is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

855
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:58,700
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

856
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,800
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

857
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:08,900
that's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

858
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:10,100
Right.

859
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,700
The security systems around here
are a joke.

860
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:20,000
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's escape route No. 1.

861
01:16:20,900 --> 01:16:21,900
No. 2:

862
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,100
<i>Over here. Anaheim to the 110.</i>

863
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,300
Good.

864
01:16:25,600 --> 01:16:26,600
You got it?

865
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:28,000
Good. Let's go.

866
01:16:49,800 --> 01:16:51,300
They were looking back...

867
01:16:52,700 --> 01:16:54,100
in this direction.

868
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,600
A container facility?

869
01:16:56,700 --> 01:16:58,100
What? Cartage theft?

870
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,900
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

871
01:17:04,900 --> 01:17:07,000
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

872
01:17:07,100 --> 01:17:08,400
Refinery only pays by check.

873
01:17:08,500 --> 01:17:09,700
No cash around.

874
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:11,500
Same for the scrap yard.

875
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,100
Stealing hubcaps?

876
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,400
A refinery and a scrap yard.

877
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:25,300
What the hell is going on?

878
01:17:25,500 --> 01:17:27,500
That's what we are trying to figure out.

879
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,700
We thought we had it.

880
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:31,700
Thought we had it.

881
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,500
I got an idea...

882
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:45,300
on what they were looking at.

883
01:17:48,800 --> 01:17:50,900
Want to know what they're looking at?

884
01:17:52,700 --> 01:17:55,500
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

885
01:17:56,900 --> 01:17:58,800
This crew is good.

886
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,500
Know what they're looking at?

887
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:04,400
What?

888
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:06,700
Us.

889
01:18:08,200 --> 01:18:09,600
The LAPD.

890
01:18:10,200 --> 01:18:11,900
The police department.

891
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:14,600
We just got made.

892
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:23,400
Yeah!

893
01:18:31,700 --> 01:18:32,700
Okay!

894
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:43,800
Okay, motherfucker!

895
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:04,900
Kelso come through?

896
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:07,600
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

897
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:14,700
Name is Hanna.

898
01:19:15,100 --> 01:19:16,500
First name, Vincent.

899
01:19:17,100 --> 01:19:18,900
I smeared this sergeant five yards.

900
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:20,500
Hanna's all over you.

901
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:23,900
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

902
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,300
Not yours. They've been
losing you at night.

903
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,600
He's a hot dog.

904
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:30,100
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

905
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,400
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

906
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,900
He's taken down some heavy crews.
He blew away Frankie in Chicago.

907
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,600
He was a fucking maniac.

908
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:40,500
He was working Narcotics before that.

909
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:43,300
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

910
01:19:43,400 --> 01:19:45,000
He's why the extra heat.

911
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:49,300
The vice sergeant...

912
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:52,400
says Hanna likes you...

913
01:19:53,400 --> 01:19:56,600
thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, that sharp.

914
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,100
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

915
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:02,900
Funny as a heart attack.

916
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,300
Three marriages? Do you think
that means he likes staying home?

917
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:09,400
Means he's one of those guys out there...

918
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:12,200
prowling around all night, dedicated.

919
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:16,800
With him and this much heat,
you should pass.

920
01:20:23,800 --> 01:20:25,300
It's worth the stretch.

921
01:20:26,300 --> 01:20:28,200
This guy can hit or miss.

922
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,200
You can't miss once.

923
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,100
You sure?

924
01:20:33,200 --> 01:20:34,500
I am sure.

925
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:41,700
Let's go to the garage.

926
01:21:09,000 --> 01:21:10,300
Where are we going?

927
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,800
Where are you going?

928
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,100
Out.

929
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:15,400
What are they on?

930
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:16,700
<i>TAC 9.</i>

931
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:22,300
<i>They're northbound out LAX on the 405.</i>
<i>We got four ground units.</i>

932
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:42,900
<i>This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.</i>
<i>Who have I got?</i>

933
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,400
<i>This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.</i>

934
01:22:45,500 --> 01:22:48,500
<i>Richard Glover's with me.</i>
<i>It's on the 105 eastbound...</i>

935
01:22:48,700 --> 01:22:50,400
<i>approaching the 110.</i>

936
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:53,000
Revolving tail?

937
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:55,700
<i>I got two units in front, three behind.</i>

938
01:22:55,900 --> 01:22:58,900
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

939
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:01,100
Let's go.

940
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:53,000
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

941
01:23:53,200 --> 01:23:55,100
<i>Three hundred yards, center lane.</i>

942
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,700
How're you doing?

943
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:06,800
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

944
01:25:13,100 --> 01:25:14,300
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

945
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:16,200
Follow me.

946
01:25:31,400 --> 01:25:33,100
Seven years in Folsom.

947
01:25:33,900 --> 01:25:35,600
In the hole for three.

948
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:37,100
McNeil before that.

949
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:42,300
McNeil as tough as they say?

950
01:25:43,500 --> 01:25:45,300
You looking to become a penologist?

951
01:25:46,600 --> 01:25:48,100
You looking to go back?

952
01:25:48,400 --> 01:25:52,400
I chased down some crews. Guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

953
01:25:52,500 --> 01:25:53,500
That you?

954
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:56,800
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

955
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,200
I worked all kinds.

956
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:06,500
You see me doing liquor store holdups
with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

957
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:08,700
I do not.

958
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:09,900
Right.

959
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,100
I am never going back.

960
01:26:14,900 --> 01:26:16,900
Then don't take down scores.

961
01:26:18,100 --> 01:26:19,700
I do what I do best:

962
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,600
I take scores. You do what you do best:
Try to stop guys like me.

963
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,500
You never wanted a regular-type life?

964
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:32,800
What is that? Barbecues and ball games?

965
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:35,700
Yeah.

966
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:40,100
This regular-type life like your life?

967
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,600
My life? No, my life...

968
01:26:44,300 --> 01:26:45,900
My life's a disaster zone.

969
01:26:47,700 --> 01:26:50,100
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

970
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,600
because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

971
01:26:53,700 --> 01:26:54,700
I got a wife.

972
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:57,500
We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage.

973
01:26:57,700 --> 01:26:58,700
My third.

974
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,300
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

975
01:27:04,500 --> 01:27:05,700
That's my life.

976
01:27:12,000 --> 01:27:13,600
A guy told me one time:

977
01:27:15,400 --> 01:27:19,600
"Don't get attached to anything
you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

978
01:27:19,700 --> 01:27:22,000
"if you feel the heat around the corner."

979
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:26,500
If you're on me and you got to move
when I move...

980
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:29,800
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

981
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:33,300
That's an interesting point.

982
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:36,000
Are you a monk?

983
01:27:37,300 --> 01:27:38,500
I have a woman.

984
01:27:39,000 --> 01:27:40,400
What do you tell her?

985
01:27:42,800 --> 01:27:44,400
I tell her I'm a salesman.

986
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,800
So, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

987
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,600
you'll just walk out on her?

988
01:27:58,200 --> 01:27:59,700
Not say good-bye?

989
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:02,000
That's the discipline.

990
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,500
That's pretty vacant.

991
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:06,300
It is what it is.

992
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:09,100
It's that, or we both better go
do something else.

993
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:12,900
I don't know how to do anything else.

994
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:14,700
Neither do I.

995
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:18,900
I don't want to either.

996
01:28:19,700 --> 01:28:20,800
Neither do I.

997
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:30,700
You know, I have this recurring dream.

998
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:35,300
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

999
01:28:35,500 --> 01:28:38,900
all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are there...

1000
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:42,700
and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

1001
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,100
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

1002
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,400
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

1003
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:55,000
because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

1004
01:28:55,800 --> 01:28:58,100
The neighbors reported the smell...

1005
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,600
and there they are...

1006
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,400
all just sitting there.

1007
01:29:04,600 --> 01:29:05,700
What do they say?

1008
01:29:07,600 --> 01:29:08,600
Nothing.

1009
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:10,100
No talk?

1010
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:13,900
They have nothing to say.

1011
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:16,700
We just look at each other.

1012
01:29:17,700 --> 01:29:19,200
They look at me...

1013
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:21,800
and that's it. That's the dream.

1014
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,300
I have one where I'm drowning.

1015
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:30,500
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing
or I'll die in my sleep.

1016
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:33,900
Know what that's about?

1017
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:36,800
Having enough time.

1018
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:39,600
Enough time...

1019
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,700
to do what you want to do?

1020
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,100
That's right.

1021
01:29:45,500 --> 01:29:46,800
You doing it now?

1022
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:48,100
No, not yet.

1023
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,400
You know, we're sitting here...

1024
01:29:56,800 --> 01:29:58,900
like a couple of regular fellas.

1025
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:01,700
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

1026
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:06,000
Now that we've been face to face...

1027
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,400
if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

1028
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:13,100
I won't like it.

1029
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,100
But, I tell you...

1030
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:19,400
if it's between you...

1031
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:23,300
and some poor bastard whose wife
you're gonna turn into a widow...

1032
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:25,300
brother...

1033
01:30:25,800 --> 01:30:27,600
you are going down.

1034
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,800
There's a flip side to that coin.

1035
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:46,100
What if you do got me boxed in...

1036
01:30:46,600 --> 01:30:48,300
and I gotta put you down?

1037
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:51,000
Because no matter what...

1038
01:30:51,500 --> 01:30:53,400
you won't get in my way.

1039
01:30:54,700 --> 01:30:56,800
We've been face to face, yeah.

1040
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:01,600
But I will not hesitate.

1041
01:31:01,900 --> 01:31:03,200
Not for a second.

1042
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:10,900
Maybe that'll happen.

1043
01:31:13,500 --> 01:31:14,500
Or...

1044
01:31:14,800 --> 01:31:16,100
who knows?

1045
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:18,900
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1046
01:31:34,300 --> 01:31:35,700
They dumped us.

1047
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:37,900
What?

1048
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,800
They dumped us.

1049
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:41,500
What do you mean?

1050
01:31:41,700 --> 01:31:42,900
Chris slipped away.

1051
01:31:43,000 --> 01:31:44,800
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1052
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:48,100
so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I just tried.

1053
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,300
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

1054
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:53,000
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

1055
01:31:55,600 --> 01:31:57,300
They dumped all our surveillance?

1056
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:59,500
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1057
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:03,800
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1058
01:32:04,000 --> 01:32:04,900
We were on you.

1059
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:08,800
Then McCauley drives in to LAX
where surveillance can't fly over.

1060
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:11,800
His car's still there. He's gone.

1061
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:21,300
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

1062
01:33:18,800 --> 01:33:19,700
Hear from him?

1063
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:24,400
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

1064
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:27,800
This guy...

1065
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,300
we put him on.

1066
01:33:29,500 --> 01:33:31,000
Says he knows McCauley.

1067
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:37,500
Who are you?

1068
01:33:38,700 --> 01:33:39,800
Waingro.

1069
01:33:40,400 --> 01:33:41,900
My name's Waingro.

1070
01:33:42,300 --> 01:33:45,300
I've been living in this office.
How well do you know him?

1071
01:33:46,700 --> 01:33:49,000
We took some major scores together.

1072
01:33:52,800 --> 01:33:54,600
Why haven't I heard from him?

1073
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:56,500
He's probably busy right now.

1074
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,700
But he's real thorough.

1075
01:34:00,000 --> 01:34:02,100
He ain't going to forget about you.

1076
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:03,700
That's reassuring.

1077
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:07,800
I got some moves I could make here.

1078
01:34:08,900 --> 01:34:11,000
Probably be a big help to you.

1079
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,300
You recognize the grill man?

1080
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:41,400
No.

1081
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:42,500
Folsom.

1082
01:34:42,700 --> 01:34:44,900
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1083
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:47,900
I ain't got my break yet.

1084
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:50,100
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1085
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:52,900
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1086
01:34:53,200 --> 01:34:54,800
Take your break later.

1087
01:34:55,200 --> 01:34:56,500
Piece of shit.

1088
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:58,000
Pick up!

1089
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:02,600
Where the hell is he?

1090
01:35:02,700 --> 01:35:04,800
I want to check the slot for the work car.

1091
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,100
So did I.

1092
01:35:13,700 --> 01:35:14,700
Hang on.

1093
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:22,100
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

1094
01:35:33,500 --> 01:35:34,600
Where are you?

1095
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:37,300
There's cops all over me, man,
like a cheap suit.

1096
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:39,500
I can't dump them.

1097
01:35:42,200 --> 01:35:43,900
They know you see them?

1098
01:35:44,200 --> 01:35:46,000
They're doing parallels.

1099
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,100
I can try to dump them again.

1100
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:52,100
<i>How are we going to know if you did?</i>

1101
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:53,700
If not, you'll draw them to us.

1102
01:35:54,300 --> 01:35:55,300
Go to Ventura.

1103
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:56,700
<i>Pull them out of here.</i>

1104
01:35:56,800 --> 01:36:00,100
I'm sorry. Last thing I wanted to do
was let you down.

1105
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,600
Pick up.

1106
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,500
Neil, man. What's up?

1107
01:36:30,700 --> 01:36:31,700
What's up?

1108
01:36:31,800 --> 01:36:33,400
What are you doing here?

1109
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:37,000
I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners on the radio.

1110
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:38,400
Right now, today.

1111
01:36:38,800 --> 01:36:40,000
You remember the drill?

1112
01:36:40,100 --> 01:36:41,300
Yeah, sure.

1113
01:36:41,500 --> 01:36:42,600
You cool?

1114
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:44,900
You know I'm cool.

1115
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:47,900
One answer: yes or no. Right now.

1116
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,200
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1117
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:07,000
Out back in five.

1118
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:18,400
What's burning?

1119
01:37:18,900 --> 01:37:20,100
What is this?

1120
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:22,500
Where do you think you're going?

1121
01:38:54,800 --> 01:38:56,800
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

1122
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:57,900
Hands up!

1123
01:38:58,100 --> 01:38:59,700
Put them up! Now!

1124
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:02,000
Get on your knees!

1125
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:03,100
The keys!

1126
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,500
Get on your knees!

1127
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:10,800
Get over there!

1128
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,200
Turn around!

1129
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:14,900
Put your hands behind you!

1130
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:16,000
Get down!

1131
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:17,100
Stay down!

1132
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:19,100
Get down!

1133
01:39:21,800 --> 01:39:24,100
- Down!
- The keys! The keys!

1134
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:29,700
Stay down!

1135
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:33,400
We want to hurt no one.
We want the bank's money, not yours.

1136
01:39:33,500 --> 01:39:36,400
Your money is insured by the government.
You won't lose a dime.

1137
01:39:36,500 --> 01:39:37,600
Think of your families.

1138
01:39:37,800 --> 01:39:40,100
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

1139
01:39:40,500 --> 01:39:45,000
I want you to sit on the floor, put your
hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

1140
01:39:45,100 --> 01:39:47,500
anybody got heart trouble,
lean against the wall.

1141
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:49,900
The key.

1142
01:39:50,100 --> 01:39:51,300
What key?

1143
01:39:53,200 --> 01:39:55,100
Sit down and stay down!

1144
01:39:56,100 --> 01:39:58,600
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1145
01:40:45,900 --> 01:40:47,800
Get down. Down, down, down.

1146
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,400
Put your heads down!

1147
01:41:14,000 --> 01:41:16,200
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1148
01:41:16,300 --> 01:41:19,400
This C.I., Hugh Benny,
called in about a bank.

1149
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:25,300
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1150
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:44,200
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth...

1151
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,300
and I want a block
northbound Flower at Sixth.

1152
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,600
They're already coming out.

1153
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,100
We gotta take them in the car.

1154
01:42:28,300 --> 01:42:30,000
Wait till they are all in.

1155
01:42:30,300 --> 01:42:32,500
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1156
01:42:41,600 --> 01:42:42,900
Police! Move!

1157
01:42:44,400 --> 01:42:45,700
Move. Move. Get down.

1158
01:43:06,900 --> 01:43:08,200
Move it. Down, down.

1159
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:12,700
We did it!

1160
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:18,000
Move!

1161
01:43:24,000 --> 01:43:25,200
Get down!

1162
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,300
Get in the car!

1163
01:43:51,400 --> 01:43:52,600
Go! Go!

1164
01:44:51,000 --> 01:44:52,000
Go!

1165
01:45:15,900 --> 01:45:16,800
Go!

1166
01:46:53,800 --> 01:46:54,700
Come on!

1167
01:47:26,400 --> 01:47:27,700
Get down!

1168
01:47:40,300 --> 01:47:44,000
All the way down! Get down! Now!

1169
01:48:41,700 --> 01:48:42,900
Come here.

1170
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:27,900
I got you.

1171
01:49:32,000 --> 01:49:36,200
<i>Tragedy in the neighborhood today.</i>
<i>A bank robbery spilled out into the street.</i>

1172
01:49:36,600 --> 01:49:39,500
<i>Claudia Newman, live on the scene.</i>
<i>She has the latest.</i>

1173
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:43,500
<i>This afternoon, a neighborhood was</i>
<i>terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.</i>

1174
01:49:43,700 --> 01:49:47,300
<i>With the streets full of shoppers and kids,</i>
<i>police and armed robbers...</i>

1175
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:48,700
Excuse me, bartender.

1176
01:49:49,000 --> 01:49:52,600
<i>Our top story tonight:</i>
<i>Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.</i>

1177
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:55,700
<i>A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken</i>
<i>by a bank robbery...</i>

1178
01:49:56,000 --> 01:49:58,300
<i>that ended in homicide and terror.</i>

1179
01:49:58,600 --> 01:49:59,900
<i>Michael Cheritto...</i>

1180
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:03,900
<i>one of four men involved</i>
<i>in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.</i>

1181
01:50:04,000 --> 01:50:05,200
<i>Also fatally wounded:</i>

1182
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:08,500
<i>another suspect, Donald Breedan,</i>
<i>who died of gunshot wounds...</i>

1183
01:50:08,600 --> 01:50:12,100
<i>during the extensive gunfire</i>
<i>between police and suspects.</i>

1184
01:50:14,100 --> 01:50:15,500
All right, hold him.

1185
01:50:15,800 --> 01:50:17,300
It's all right.

1186
01:50:25,000 --> 01:50:26,000
So?

1187
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:28,000
He's got blood loss and shock.

1188
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:31,700
I'll give you quarter-grain bottles
of morphine for the pain.

1189
01:50:32,600 --> 01:50:33,700
Bottom line?

1190
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,800
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1191
01:50:37,200 --> 01:50:39,500
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

1192
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:41,200
Six, seven hours.

1193
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,800
- That's it?
- That's it.

1194
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,600
Take off your shirt.

1195
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:45,700
What?

1196
01:50:47,200 --> 01:50:48,500
Take off your shirt.

1197
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:58,000
My daughter gave it to me.

1198
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:00,200
I don't give a shit. Take it off.

1199
01:51:12,100 --> 01:51:13,200
Listen to me.

1200
01:51:13,600 --> 01:51:17,400
Nate's going to pick you up.
He's going to take you to his place.

1201
01:51:18,800 --> 01:51:19,800
Where's Charlene?

1202
01:51:19,900 --> 01:51:24,100
We gotta go. We're on the 6:00 news.
We gotta get out of here.

1203
01:51:24,200 --> 01:51:26,100
I'm not going without her.

1204
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:27,700
Think about that.

1205
01:51:28,100 --> 01:51:29,800
I will meet you at Nate's.

1206
01:51:30,000 --> 01:51:31,300
Where are you going?

1207
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:35,000
To find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1208
01:51:35,500 --> 01:51:36,700
Who did it?

1209
01:51:38,000 --> 01:51:39,300
Who wasn't there?

1210
01:51:40,700 --> 01:51:41,700
Trejo.

1211
01:51:45,400 --> 01:51:46,900
See you at Nate's.

1212
01:51:54,900 --> 01:51:56,200
You still want me?

1213
01:51:56,600 --> 01:51:59,600
You come down here right now
and get me. Dominick and me.

1214
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:01,900
<i>Okay, baby.</i>

1215
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:04,200
<i>I'll be there in two hours.</i>

1216
01:52:05,500 --> 01:52:06,500
All right.

1217
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:10,100
Goddamn you, Chris.

1218
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:11,300
Goddamn you.

1219
01:52:12,300 --> 01:52:14,400
You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

1220
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:15,700
Right.

1221
01:53:02,000 --> 01:53:04,100
Why did you do it? What happened?

1222
01:53:05,400 --> 01:53:06,900
- They made me.
- Who?

1223
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:08,200
Where's Anna?

1224
01:53:09,600 --> 01:53:10,600
She's dead.

1225
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:16,400
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1226
01:53:17,000 --> 01:53:18,000
Who did it?

1227
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:19,100
Who did it?

1228
01:53:19,300 --> 01:53:20,900
They had Anna, man.

1229
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:22,000
Who?

1230
01:53:23,400 --> 01:53:24,500
Waingro.

1231
01:53:25,200 --> 01:53:26,400
Waingro.

1232
01:53:27,200 --> 01:53:28,200
On his own?

1233
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,800
- For someone.
- Who?

1234
01:53:33,100 --> 01:53:35,300
The other he worked for.

1235
01:53:36,400 --> 01:53:37,600
Van Zant.

1236
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:41,700
Van Zant?

1237
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:46,900
Are you sure?

1238
01:53:47,500 --> 01:53:48,700
Van Zant.

1239
01:53:50,400 --> 01:53:52,700
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

1240
01:53:53,800 --> 01:53:55,100
I don't think so.

1241
01:53:55,800 --> 01:53:56,900
Come on.

1242
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,200
I don't remember.

1243
01:54:05,400 --> 01:54:06,500
I'll call a medic.

1244
01:54:06,600 --> 01:54:08,400
I'm not going to make it.

1245
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:12,600
I can't feel nothing.

1246
01:54:14,800 --> 01:54:16,500
My Anna's gone.

1247
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:20,200
She's gone.

1248
01:54:22,200 --> 01:54:24,100
Don't leave me like this.

1249
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,500
Please, homes.

1250
01:54:27,600 --> 01:54:29,500
Don't leave me like this.

1251
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:57,700
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1252
01:54:58,600 --> 01:54:59,700
It's a new one.

1253
01:55:01,200 --> 01:55:03,500
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1254
01:55:03,900 --> 01:55:05,200
10725.

1255
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:06,900
<i>10725.</i>

1256
01:55:07,200 --> 01:55:08,200
<i>Chris?</i>

1257
01:55:08,700 --> 01:55:10,300
He's with me, my place.

1258
01:55:10,700 --> 01:55:12,900
Next, Waingro, okay?

1259
01:55:14,700 --> 01:55:15,900
You got the time?

1260
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:18,200
I'll make time.

1261
01:55:18,600 --> 01:55:20,200
And I need a new out.

1262
01:55:20,900 --> 01:55:22,000
Is it blown?

1263
01:55:23,700 --> 01:55:25,300
How can I trust it?

1264
01:55:28,300 --> 01:55:29,300
You got it.

1265
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:31,700
Stay healthy.

1266
01:55:37,100 --> 01:55:38,600
Charlene Shiherlis.

1267
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:42,300
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

1268
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:43,900
Neil's transportation.

1269
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,700
Get on the phone. Somewhere, someone's
trying to put it together for him.

1270
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:50,400
You don't believe he already had a plan?

1271
01:55:50,500 --> 01:55:52,000
Sure. Now he needs another.

1272
01:55:52,200 --> 01:55:54,200
Would you trust yours
after this afternoon?

1273
01:55:55,800 --> 01:55:58,100
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1274
01:55:58,300 --> 01:56:01,700
He's a C.I. for a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1275
01:56:01,900 --> 01:56:03,400
On Neil McCauley.

1276
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,000
How much time we got?

1277
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:09,900
Eight, ten hours for him to set up
a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1278
01:57:01,400 --> 01:57:04,000
You ratted McCauley to us!
How'd you know?

1279
01:57:04,300 --> 01:57:05,500
Who told you?

1280
01:57:05,900 --> 01:57:08,100
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1281
01:57:08,400 --> 01:57:09,400
Who?

1282
01:57:52,300 --> 01:57:53,700
Waingro, where is he?

1283
01:57:54,700 --> 01:57:55,700
Where?

1284
01:57:55,900 --> 01:57:57,100
How would I know?

1285
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:22,800
Well...

1286
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:25,000
what do we have here?

1287
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,100
This pretty?

1288
01:58:27,200 --> 01:58:28,200
This pretty?

1289
01:58:31,700 --> 01:58:33,100
You piece of shit.

1290
01:58:33,200 --> 01:58:36,100
Told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared, right?

1291
01:58:36,200 --> 01:58:37,900
You want out? This is out.

1292
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:41,100
- Yeah, what's your end?
- I don't need no stupid broad.

1293
01:58:41,700 --> 01:58:43,000
How'd I get into this?

1294
01:58:43,100 --> 01:58:44,100
Easy.

1295
01:58:44,900 --> 01:58:47,100
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1296
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:48,500
Fix her a drink.

1297
01:58:48,700 --> 01:58:50,400
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1298
01:58:50,600 --> 01:58:51,500
Fuck her.

1299
01:58:53,900 --> 01:58:56,400
You better get in there and stay in there.

1300
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:01,100
Lookie here.

1301
01:59:02,600 --> 01:59:05,200
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

1302
01:59:05,400 --> 01:59:07,100
You want to put Dominick
in the bedroom?

1303
01:59:07,200 --> 01:59:08,900
He stays with me.

1304
01:59:18,600 --> 01:59:19,900
So, what now?

1305
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:23,700
He's right.

1306
01:59:23,800 --> 01:59:25,700
You want out? This is out.

1307
01:59:27,500 --> 01:59:29,600
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1308
01:59:29,800 --> 01:59:30,900
No shit.

1309
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:33,700
That's right. You would have to.

1310
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:38,000
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1311
01:59:39,000 --> 01:59:42,300
'Cause he'll be an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1312
01:59:42,400 --> 01:59:46,900
'cause you got no parents to take him.
So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1313
01:59:47,100 --> 01:59:48,900
juvenile facilities.

1314
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:50,800
Then he steals a car.

1315
01:59:51,500 --> 01:59:56,100
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1316
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:58,900
Fucked for life.

1317
02:00:00,100 --> 02:00:02,600
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1318
02:00:04,200 --> 02:00:08,300
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life. But Chris did.

1319
02:00:10,300 --> 02:00:12,900
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1320
02:00:13,800 --> 02:00:15,100
You can do it...

1321
02:00:15,500 --> 02:00:17,600
for your kid, so you can raise him.

1322
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:22,800
What else are you selling?

1323
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:24,200
All kinds of shit.

1324
02:00:25,700 --> 02:00:30,300
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1325
02:00:36,800 --> 02:00:38,200
<i>Here's an update.</i>

1326
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,800
Drucker's on Line 2.

1327
02:00:40,000 --> 02:00:41,400
<i>Hold on for a second.</i>

1328
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:46,000
Drucker's on the other line.

1329
02:00:46,600 --> 02:00:47,800
Conference him in.

1330
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:50,000
Go ahead.

1331
02:00:50,400 --> 02:00:51,900
Vincent, it's me.

1332
02:00:54,500 --> 02:00:56,500
One answer. What's it going to be?

1333
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:05,700
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1334
02:01:05,800 --> 02:01:08,700
That's good. Here's the deal.

1335
02:01:09,200 --> 02:01:12,100
Hugh Benny has reformed
his wayward life...

1336
02:01:12,300 --> 02:01:14,600
and become a born-again good citizen.

1337
02:01:15,000 --> 02:01:19,000
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1338
02:01:19,400 --> 02:01:24,000
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew,
then went to work for a money launderer:

1339
02:01:24,100 --> 02:01:25,300
<i>Van Zant.</i>

1340
02:01:26,000 --> 02:01:28,900
Units are at Van Zant's house
as we speak...

1341
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:31,000
because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1342
02:01:31,600 --> 02:01:34,700
<i>If Neil goes after anybody else,</i>
<i>it's going to be Waingro.</i>

1343
02:01:35,000 --> 02:01:38,300
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the Airport Marquis...

1344
02:01:38,400 --> 02:01:40,200
under the name Jamieson.

1345
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:44,800
He's there now. I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1346
02:01:45,000 --> 02:01:47,800
<i>assignment officers</i>
<i>and snitches in County.</i>

1347
02:01:47,900 --> 02:01:52,100
Anyone you can think of who'll put it
on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

1348
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:54,500
<i>and personally check their coms</i>
<i>every 30 minutes.</i>

1349
02:01:54,700 --> 02:01:56,900
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1350
02:01:57,200 --> 02:01:58,500
How're you feeling?

1351
02:01:59,200 --> 02:02:00,700
Banged up, but I'll live.

1352
02:02:09,600 --> 02:02:10,800
He's here.

1353
02:02:11,600 --> 02:02:13,100
Neil is still here.

1354
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,700
I can feel it.

1355
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:17,900
For how long?

1356
02:02:19,400 --> 02:02:21,200
Seven, eight hours, max.

1357
02:02:30,200 --> 02:02:31,500
What did you do?

1358
02:02:32,000 --> 02:02:33,000
That was you?

1359
02:02:33,400 --> 02:02:35,200
I don't sell metal.

1360
02:02:35,900 --> 02:02:38,800
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1361
02:02:38,900 --> 02:02:40,400
We gotta go together.

1362
02:02:40,900 --> 02:02:43,100
Those other people were with you?

1363
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:46,100
My friend, Michael...

1364
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:49,600
he knew the risks.

1365
02:02:54,000 --> 02:02:55,900
When it rains, you get wet.

1366
02:02:58,600 --> 02:03:00,100
Get packed. Let's go.

1367
02:03:18,800 --> 02:03:20,600
Why did you do this to me?

1368
02:03:31,800 --> 02:03:33,000
It'll be all right.

1369
02:03:33,200 --> 02:03:35,000
Do you understand?

1370
02:03:39,500 --> 02:03:41,100
It's going to be all right.

1371
02:03:52,200 --> 02:03:55,100
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1372
02:04:00,200 --> 02:04:01,600
Here's some cash.

1373
02:04:04,500 --> 02:04:05,700
When is it over?

1374
02:04:09,000 --> 02:04:10,600
Twenty-two hours from now.

1375
02:04:11,000 --> 02:04:14,800
- Then we get out of here clean.
- When will you let me leave?

1376
02:04:18,300 --> 02:04:19,200
Go now.

1377
02:04:19,400 --> 02:04:21,200
You want out? There's the door.

1378
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:23,700
Will you let me leave later?

1379
02:04:28,700 --> 02:04:30,100
It will be different.

1380
02:04:31,800 --> 02:04:33,400
Do you even understand?

1381
02:05:03,100 --> 02:05:04,400
It's ready.

1382
02:05:11,800 --> 02:05:13,500
This is my friend Ralph.

1383
02:05:14,200 --> 02:05:16,000
You didn't tell me you were...

1384
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:18,100
Oh, my God!

1385
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:19,500
Where's Lauren?

1386
02:05:19,900 --> 02:05:21,500
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1387
02:05:22,000 --> 02:05:24,100
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

1388
02:05:24,200 --> 02:05:25,200
What for?

1389
02:05:25,400 --> 02:05:26,400
Sit down.

1390
02:05:27,400 --> 02:05:28,700
Don't you get angry?

1391
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,600
I'm angry.

1392
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:34,000
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1393
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:37,500
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1394
02:05:39,100 --> 02:05:42,300
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1395
02:05:43,400 --> 02:05:45,100
In her ex-husband's...

1396
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:48,700
dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...

1397
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:50,200
if you want to.

1398
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,900
But you do not get to watch...

1399
02:05:55,200 --> 02:05:57,000
my fucking...

1400
02:05:57,100 --> 02:05:58,200
television set!

1401
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,600
For God's sake.

1402
02:06:06,200 --> 02:06:07,900
Put the television set down.

1403
02:06:08,100 --> 02:06:10,500
- I never cheated on you, bitch.
- Maybe you should have.

1404
02:06:10,700 --> 02:06:12,700
- I should have?
- You're a party to this.

1405
02:06:12,800 --> 02:06:15,900
I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1406
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:17,500
Our situation is absurd.

1407
02:06:20,100 --> 02:06:22,700
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1408
02:06:25,600 --> 02:06:29,200
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and explain them to you?

1409
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:31,900
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1410
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:33,200
How admirable.

1411
02:06:33,300 --> 02:06:35,500
- You bet.
- Except none of it's about us.

1412
02:06:36,100 --> 02:06:37,100
No.

1413
02:06:38,500 --> 02:06:41,300
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1414
02:06:42,100 --> 02:06:44,100
you walk through our life dead.

1415
02:06:44,800 --> 02:06:48,700
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1416
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,500
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1417
02:07:04,000 --> 02:07:05,200
The plane...

1418
02:07:05,600 --> 02:07:08,900
charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1419
02:07:09,100 --> 02:07:10,600
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1420
02:07:13,800 --> 02:07:14,900
Touches down...

1421
02:07:15,000 --> 02:07:17,400
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1422
02:07:17,600 --> 02:07:21,000
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1423
02:07:22,800 --> 02:07:23,900
Where's Chris?

1424
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:25,200
He's gone.

1425
02:07:26,500 --> 02:07:27,500
What?

1426
02:07:28,100 --> 02:07:30,500
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

1427
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:32,800
- Did you bring him here?
- Yeah, I did.

1428
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:34,600
What happened?

1429
02:07:35,700 --> 02:07:37,200
It's a free country.

1430
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:43,900
Check in with me at 9:00...

1431
02:07:44,200 --> 02:07:45,900
everything is still cool.

1432
02:07:47,700 --> 02:07:48,800
All right.

1433
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:13,400
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1434
02:08:16,600 --> 02:08:18,300
I know life is short.

1435
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:20,900
Whatever time you get is luck.

1436
02:08:23,600 --> 02:08:25,000
You want to walk?

1437
02:08:27,800 --> 02:08:29,500
You walk right now...

1438
02:08:31,000 --> 02:08:32,500
all on your own.

1439
02:08:33,200 --> 02:08:35,700
On your own you choose to come with me.

1440
02:08:41,900 --> 02:08:43,400
All I know is...

1441
02:08:45,600 --> 02:08:49,100
there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1442
02:08:50,300 --> 02:08:52,100
if it's going to be alone...

1443
02:08:53,200 --> 02:08:54,600
without you.

1444
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:53,300
I got a live one.

1445
02:09:54,200 --> 02:09:55,500
I'll hold.

1446
02:09:57,900 --> 02:09:59,300
Show yourself.

1447
02:10:00,400 --> 02:10:02,300
- Do it.
- Shut up!

1448
02:10:06,000 --> 02:10:08,100
Now, just one second at the window...

1449
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:11,100
and it's all over.

1450
02:11:56,600 --> 02:11:57,600
Hey, man...

1451
02:11:59,300 --> 02:12:02,400
you know any place to rent around here?

1452
02:12:05,700 --> 02:12:07,700
The grocer has got cards on the wall.

1453
02:12:19,400 --> 02:12:20,500
It's not him.

1454
02:12:20,600 --> 02:12:21,900
It's not Chris.

1455
02:12:29,700 --> 02:12:31,300
Unit 2, this is Command.

1456
02:12:31,800 --> 02:12:33,100
Take him at the street.

1457
02:12:33,200 --> 02:12:34,300
Check him out.

1458
02:13:00,900 --> 02:13:02,200
He's John Peterson.

1459
02:13:02,400 --> 02:13:04,200
<i>Valid ID. Car's registered to...</i>

1460
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:06,700
<i>Bukowski, Gene.</i>

1461
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,100
<i>Ran it to DMV.</i>

1462
02:13:08,300 --> 02:13:09,500
<i>It's clean.</i>

1463
02:13:12,300 --> 02:13:13,400
Let him go.

1464
02:13:13,900 --> 02:13:14,900
Roger.

1465
02:13:15,200 --> 02:13:17,100
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1466
02:13:19,400 --> 02:13:20,400
It's no-go.

1467
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:32,500
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

1468
02:13:32,600 --> 02:13:34,200
Yeah, that would be nice.

1469
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:05,400
What do you got?

1470
02:14:05,500 --> 02:14:06,900
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

1471
02:14:19,600 --> 02:14:21,000
Hello, it's Vincent.

1472
02:14:21,600 --> 02:14:22,600
<i>What do you got?</i>

1473
02:14:22,700 --> 02:14:25,000
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1474
02:14:25,400 --> 02:14:26,400
<i>That's it.</i>

1475
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:36,100
You know what?

1476
02:14:38,600 --> 02:14:39,900
Neil is gone.

1477
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:46,300
Flying like a bird.

1478
02:14:47,200 --> 02:14:48,500
How do you know?

1479
02:14:50,000 --> 02:14:51,100
We still got bait!

1480
02:14:51,300 --> 02:14:53,200
- Maybe some time!
- What do we got?

1481
02:14:53,400 --> 02:14:54,600
What do we got?

1482
02:14:55,500 --> 02:14:57,300
<i>Bon voyage,</i> motherfucker.

1483
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:00,200
You were good.

1484
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:03,500
I'm going to the hotel.

1485
02:15:04,800 --> 02:15:06,600
I'm going to take a shower...

1486
02:15:07,600 --> 02:15:10,300
and I'm going to sleep for a month.

1487
02:17:15,900 --> 02:17:16,900
Here.

1488
02:17:23,700 --> 02:17:24,700
Come on.

1489
02:17:33,000 --> 02:17:34,000
Shit.

1490
02:17:43,000 --> 02:17:44,600
Motherfucking waste.

1491
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:50,800
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1492
02:17:50,900 --> 02:17:51,900
Not you, baby.

1493
02:17:52,000 --> 02:17:53,200
Not you.

1494
02:17:58,300 --> 02:18:01,100
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1495
02:18:01,300 --> 02:18:03,900
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

1496
02:18:11,000 --> 02:18:13,000
I need somebody to help...

1497
02:18:19,000 --> 02:18:20,000
I got you.

1498
02:18:21,300 --> 02:18:24,200
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

1499
02:18:24,800 --> 02:18:26,200
Let's get a doctor!

1500
02:18:26,300 --> 02:18:27,900
Let's go! A doctor here!

1501
02:18:28,300 --> 02:18:30,500
- There's your mama.
- Let's just calm down.

1502
02:18:30,700 --> 02:18:32,700
- Is she on any drugs?
- I'm calm. No.

1503
02:18:35,200 --> 02:18:37,500
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1504
02:18:37,900 --> 02:18:41,200
I think she cut both arteries.
I could hardly feel her pulse.

1505
02:18:41,600 --> 02:18:42,700
Her pressure's down.

1506
02:18:42,800 --> 02:18:44,900
So is her respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1507
02:18:45,100 --> 02:18:46,200
It's ready.

1508
02:18:47,800 --> 02:18:49,700
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1509
02:18:49,900 --> 02:18:50,800
I don't know.

1510
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:52,200
Where did you find her?

1511
02:18:52,400 --> 02:18:53,500
The bathtub.

1512
02:18:55,400 --> 02:18:57,600
Give her large-bore normal saline.

1513
02:18:57,700 --> 02:18:59,100
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1514
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:02,400
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for six.

1515
02:19:04,300 --> 02:19:07,600
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

1516
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:10,500
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1517
02:19:16,600 --> 02:19:19,600
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.

1518
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:21,100
Her vital signs are stable.

1519
02:19:21,300 --> 02:19:23,700
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.

1520
02:19:23,800 --> 02:19:24,800
She's okay?

1521
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,000
She's doing good.

1522
02:19:26,100 --> 02:19:27,500
She'll be okay.

1523
02:19:28,000 --> 02:19:29,800
She's going to be okay.

1524
02:19:30,000 --> 02:19:32,800
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

1525
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:37,100
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1526
02:19:41,400 --> 02:19:43,900
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1527
02:19:44,400 --> 02:19:46,300
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1528
02:19:46,500 --> 02:19:49,100
Do you understand?
I ain't going anywhere.

1529
02:20:03,500 --> 02:20:04,500
It's me.

1530
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,600
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1531
02:20:08,200 --> 02:20:10,000
I still can't find a driver...

1532
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:11,800
<i>so that's in the trust.</i>

1533
02:20:12,200 --> 02:20:13,500
<i>One other thing...</i>

1534
02:20:14,500 --> 02:20:16,300
<i>I gotta tell you.</i>

1535
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:20,700
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1536
02:20:21,000 --> 02:20:22,600
<i>which I figured you wouldn't.</i>

1537
02:20:22,900 --> 02:20:24,200
You figured right.

1538
02:20:24,700 --> 02:20:26,100
So, so long, brother.

1539
02:20:28,300 --> 02:20:29,700
You take it easy.

1540
02:20:30,400 --> 02:20:31,600
You're home free.

1541
02:20:33,600 --> 02:20:34,800
Take it easy.

1542
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:46,400
What is it?

1543
02:20:46,800 --> 02:20:47,900
Nothing.

1544
02:20:48,200 --> 02:20:49,300
Home free.

1545
02:21:26,000 --> 02:21:27,800
I gotta take care of something.

1546
02:21:28,000 --> 02:21:29,100
Is there time?

1547
02:21:29,800 --> 02:21:30,900
There's time.

1548
02:21:58,600 --> 02:22:01,100
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1549
02:22:41,700 --> 02:22:42,700
<i>Registration.</i>

1550
02:22:42,800 --> 02:22:43,800
This is room service.

1551
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:47,700
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

1552
02:22:47,800 --> 02:22:49,500
<i>- They're always doing that.</i>
- I know.

1553
02:22:49,600 --> 02:22:51,100
<i>1735.</i>

1554
02:22:51,200 --> 02:22:52,400
Thank you.

1555
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:33,500
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

1556
02:24:33,600 --> 02:24:36,500
<i>We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.</i>

1557
02:24:37,100 --> 02:24:38,400
<i>Do not panic.</i>

1558
02:24:38,600 --> 02:24:40,500
<i>Do not take the elevators.</i>

1559
02:24:45,300 --> 02:24:46,700
I'm staying here.

1560
02:24:46,800 --> 02:24:49,900
I'll check the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1561
02:24:54,400 --> 02:24:56,500
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1562
02:24:57,600 --> 02:24:59,700
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1563
02:25:01,700 --> 02:25:03,300
And she chose you.

1564
02:25:05,800 --> 02:25:07,500
She picked your place.

1565
02:25:09,600 --> 02:25:11,400
It's not right, what happened to her.

1566
02:25:11,600 --> 02:25:12,900
No, it's not.

1567
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:30,400
Is there any way that...

1568
02:25:32,700 --> 02:25:34,600
it could work out between us?

1569
02:25:37,400 --> 02:25:39,600
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1570
02:25:40,000 --> 02:25:40,900
But...

1571
02:25:41,200 --> 02:25:42,600
in the end...

1572
02:25:47,400 --> 02:25:49,000
It's like you said:

1573
02:25:52,100 --> 02:25:53,300
All I am...

1574
02:25:54,000 --> 02:25:56,000
is what I'm going after.

1575
02:26:03,200 --> 02:26:05,200
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1576
02:26:15,900 --> 02:26:17,700
Go on, if you have to.

1577
02:26:20,400 --> 02:26:21,500
I'll stay.

1578
02:26:21,600 --> 02:26:23,600
I'm okay. I can handle this.

1579
02:26:26,500 --> 02:26:27,900
Just be careful.

1580
02:26:28,700 --> 02:26:31,200
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1581
02:26:32,300 --> 02:26:33,200
Okay?

1582
02:27:31,600 --> 02:27:33,800
Security. There's a fire on three.

1583
02:27:33,900 --> 02:27:35,500
We have to evacuate all floors.

1584
02:27:35,600 --> 02:27:37,100
I can't leave here.

1585
02:27:45,700 --> 02:27:48,500
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

1586
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:03,500
He's here on 17.

1587
02:28:06,400 --> 02:28:07,500
Look at me.

1588
02:28:07,700 --> 02:28:08,700
Look at me!

1589
02:28:12,000 --> 02:28:12,900
Look at me!

1590
02:28:43,600 --> 02:28:44,900
LAPD! Don't move!

1591
02:28:45,100 --> 02:28:46,800
Put your hands on your head!

1592
02:29:20,900 --> 02:29:22,700
Switch me to TAC 5.

1593
02:29:23,300 --> 02:29:24,400
Casals...

1594
02:29:24,800 --> 02:29:25,700
JJ...

1595
02:29:26,500 --> 02:29:27,700
Drucker, JJ...

1596
02:29:27,800 --> 02:29:30,100
<i>I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.</i>

1597
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:31,200
What have you got?

1598
02:29:31,400 --> 02:29:34,000
<i>Teams are moving up the other elevators</i>
<i>to the 17th floor.</i>

1599
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:37,400
<i>Elevators are all out of commission</i>
<i>because of the fire alarm.</i>

1600
02:29:37,900 --> 02:29:39,100
Fine. 10-4.

1601
02:31:58,200 --> 02:31:59,700
Let me have that shotgun.

1602
02:38:02,400 --> 02:38:04,400
Told you I'm never going back.

1603
02:38:08,400 --> 02:38:09,400
Yeah.
