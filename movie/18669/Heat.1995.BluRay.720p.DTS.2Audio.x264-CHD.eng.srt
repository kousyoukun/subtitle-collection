1
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,148
Check, charge or cash?

2
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,412
Cash.

3
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,048
Make it out to...

4
00:03:45,192 --> 00:03:47,092
...Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

5
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,588
$788.30.

6
00:05:38,272 --> 00:05:41,436
Taking me to breakfast?

7
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,303
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

8
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,140
Hey, Vincent.

9
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,845
Where are my barrettes?

10
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:50,182
I saw them on the kitchen table.

11
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,581
I already checked.

12
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,119
Coffee?

13
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,512
No school today?

14
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:57,785
My dad's taking me to the new building and then to lunch.

15
00:05:57,891 --> 00:05:59,483
Try under the sofa cushions.

16
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,423
He's already a half an hour late.

17
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:09,196
He's going to show, or stand her up like last time?

18
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,897
I'll make coffee.

19
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:12,131
Out of time.

20
00:06:25,018 --> 00:06:27,612
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

21
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:30,418
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:33,521
I don't want to wear the blue ones. They don't match.

23
00:06:33,594 --> 00:06:36,427
- Did you check in your bathroom? - I checked everywhere!

24
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:37,929
What do you want me to do?

25
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,158
Find them!

26
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:42,234
- Mom, pay attention! - All right, sweetie, all right!

27
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,166
Daddy's going to be here.

28
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,431
I won't be ready!

29
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:47,132
- I'll be late. - No, you won't.

30
00:06:47,207 --> 00:06:48,731
I will be late!

31
00:06:49,276 --> 00:06:52,074
Before Daddy comes, we can find them if we look together.

32
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:54,773
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

33
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,984
We'll find them together, you and me. We'll find them.

34
00:06:59,052 --> 00:07:02,954
Just relaX. He won't come before we find them. I promise you.

35
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,028
Give me another refill.

36
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,048
What's your name?

37
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,377
Waingro.

38
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:40,523
You're Michael?

39
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,770
You guys always work together?

40
00:07:56,443 --> 00:07:57,910
All the time.

41
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,644
Real tight crew?

42
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,906
Real tight.

43
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:05,440
If this works good, I'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:08:05,852 --> 00:08:08,252
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:08:18,899 --> 00:08:20,196
How's he doing?

46
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,698
Hundred percent.

47
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,036
Right on schedule.

48
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,572
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

49
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,273
We're a mile and a half from you.

50
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,435
Okay.

51
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:57,127
Just crossed over the number one lane, 300 yards from you.

52
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:58,770
Get set.

53
00:08:59,005 --> 00:09:00,097
I am.

54
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:10,875
Here we go.

55
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,302
211!We're being held up!

56
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:23,219
- 211 alarm. Armored car. - There's the call.

57
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:24,615
Three minutes.

58
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:27,125
Clear!

59
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,121
Eighty seconds left!

60
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:36,257
Get back! Get back!

61
00:11:37,597 --> 00:11:38,655
Get back!

62
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:44,896
Slick, see that shit coming out of their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

63
00:11:45,038 --> 00:11:46,005
Cool it!

64
00:11:58,385 --> 00:11:59,545
I got it.

65
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,987
Got it.

66
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:06,259
You had to fuck with me.

67
00:12:06,626 --> 00:12:08,355
Want to fuck with me?

68
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:35,518
What are you doing? What did he do?

69
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,055
He was making a move.

70
00:12:46,633 --> 00:12:47,998
Dumb motherfucker.

71
00:13:43,323 --> 00:13:44,881
A million siX...

72
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,487
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

73
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,595
Here's $150,000 front money.

74
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:53,591
Get you the rest in two, three days.

75
00:13:54,768 --> 00:13:56,326
Who owned these?

76
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:02,264
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

77
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:04,442
Roger Van Zant.

78
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:06,342
Owns banks in the Caymans...

79
00:14:06,446 --> 00:14:10,382
...runs investment portfolios for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

80
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,650
So?

81
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,785
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

82
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,047
He's insured.

83
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,058
That's the point. He collects 100 percent from the insurance.

84
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,855
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds back from us...

85
00:14:21,961 --> 00:14:26,022
...for 60 percent of their value. Makes 40 percent on top of the 100 percent.

86
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:31,097
Sell it back to him, that's an eXtra $320,000 to you.

87
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:32,996
Try it on.

88
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,096
Kelso called.

89
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,300
About what?

90
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,376
A score he's putting out, he wants you to look at.

91
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,872
I don't need his score. I got my own.

92
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:44,346
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

93
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:46,148
9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

94
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,550
What happened?

95
00:14:48,955 --> 00:14:50,217
Don't ask.

96
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,650
Find the ambulance?

97
00:15:26,726 --> 00:15:28,411
- Dumped it four blocks from here. - 22nd Street.

98
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:33,890
They torched it. Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

99
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:40,600
They were airborne. They taped the last few seconds of the black-and-whites.

100
00:15:43,009 --> 00:15:44,943
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

101
00:15:45,211 --> 00:15:48,271
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier a day before yesterday.

102
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,812
You taking this one?

103
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,517
Or does it stay in Division?

104
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,144
Does this look like gangbangers working the local 7-11 to you?

105
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,190
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

106
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:01,325
We got three motorists.

107
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,812
All they saw were men with masks. They were distant.

108
00:16:02,862 --> 00:16:06,628
TV man over there, however, he was closer.

109
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,567
Did he ID anybody?

110
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,104
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

111
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,066
What about them?

112
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,074
According to TV man, this guy started mouthing off.

113
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,274
Smart.

114
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:23,541
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

115
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,935
Now, I figure this guy...

116
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:29,682
...went for that hold-out piece, ankle holster.

117
00:16:29,789 --> 00:16:31,549
From here...

118
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:33,119
...bang, bang...bang, bang, bang.

119
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:36,153
This side.

120
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:40,490
This guy has got what appears to be a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

121
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,501
Tattooing around the head wound, scorched bones, close range.Probably eXecuted.

122
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:50,535
It was a million siX in bearer bonds.

123
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:52,440
They ignored the loose cash.

124
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,345
'Cause they had no time. They were on a clock.

125
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:58,279
Which means they knew our response time to a 211...

126
00:16:58,351 --> 00:17:01,013
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

127
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,015
...escaped in under three minutes.

128
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,954
It's a good spot here. We got good escape routes.

129
00:17:07,093 --> 00:17:08,355
Two freeways...

130
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,995
...within a quarter of a mile.

131
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,358
Traffic video camera?

132
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:13,823
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

133
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,458
You recognize the M. O?

134
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,729
M. O...

135
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,628
...is that they're good.

136
00:17:18,738 --> 00:17:22,970
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all, after they killed two guards...

137
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,407
...they didn't hesitate.

138
00:17:24,477 --> 00:17:28,413
Popped guard number three because... what difference does it make?

139
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,542
Why leave a living witness?

140
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,718
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock-and-roll.

141
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,350
The shape charge.

142
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:42,421
The shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient.

143
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:44,554
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

144
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,298
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries that mystify us.

145
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:51,932
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI. You're gonna get the phone book.

146
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:54,906
Do it anyway. Who's moving the bearer bonds?

147
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,871
Check the usual fences. You and I will check Cuzomano and Torena.

148
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:02,379
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

149
00:18:02,515 --> 00:18:03,948
Hang in with Forensics.

150
00:18:04,117 --> 00:18:06,779
From the bomb squad, I want the eXplosive.

151
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:09,819
If we're lucky, it's eXotic. We can trace the sale.

152
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:14,086
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

153
00:18:22,168 --> 00:18:23,692
Anyone want some pie?

154
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,938
Gotta go to the john.

155
00:19:05,712 --> 00:19:09,580
I had to get it on. He was making a move. I had to get it on.

156
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:26,325
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

157
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,693
...to make up for his full end...

158
00:19:30,403 --> 00:19:34,499
...'cause I want to pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.

159
00:20:13,379 --> 00:20:14,277
Hold it!

160
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,742
Where's the rest?

161
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:58,613
We're late. You look too good to go out.

162
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,885
I'll just jump you right here.

163
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,052
- Where is it? - Squared the bookies, baby.

164
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:10,593
There's more in a couple of days, so don't sweat it. We're late.

165
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:11,595
Come on.

166
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:13,359
You gotta be kidding me.

167
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:16,133
Honey...

168
00:22:16,302 --> 00:22:21,035
...it ain't worth the risks you take for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

169
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,172
Let's go.

170
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:23,773
Get your coat.

171
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,873
There is no point talking. You're a child growing older.

172
00:22:29,015 --> 00:22:30,380
What does that mean?

173
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:34,676
We're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults living our lives...

174
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:36,982
...because I married a gambling junkie.

175
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,354
Get in the fucking car.

176
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,788
What am I doing in here?

177
00:22:43,596 --> 00:22:44,358
You're not!

178
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:46,898
You want me to leave the bank book and the car keys...

179
00:22:46,999 --> 00:22:48,864
...in the kitchen on the way out the door?

180
00:22:48,935 --> 00:22:52,899
- Are we going? - Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

181
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:56,670
Don't even think about...

182
00:23:21,334 --> 00:23:23,768
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

183
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,900
Albert Torena call Vincent?

184
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,207
No.

185
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,841
Report came in.

186
00:23:30,843 --> 00:23:34,142
The explosive was Dy-Ex, used in demolition.

187
00:23:34,347 --> 00:23:35,765
You can pick it up in Nevada...

188
00:23:35,815 --> 00:23:38,113
...Arizona, New MeXico.

189
00:23:38,351 --> 00:23:40,148
Too common to trace a sale.

190
00:23:40,486 --> 00:23:42,113
That's wonderful.

191
00:24:02,308 --> 00:24:03,297
You all right?

192
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,104
What happened? Where have you been?

193
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:07,771
Work.

194
00:24:09,015 --> 00:24:10,812
Lauren's dad show up?

195
00:24:12,518 --> 00:24:13,610
Didn't call...

196
00:24:13,686 --> 00:24:16,519
...didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

197
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:21,792
Now, does this guy have any idea what's going on with this kid?

198
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,524
I don't know.

199
00:24:26,532 --> 00:24:27,999
Fucking jerk.

200
00:24:29,702 --> 00:24:30,964
Is she okay?

201
00:24:32,038 --> 00:24:34,131
She's been in her room all day.

202
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,934
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

203
00:24:37,543 --> 00:24:39,010
I made dinner...

204
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:41,380
...for us, four hours ago.

205
00:24:41,747 --> 00:24:46,174
Every time I try to maintain a consistent mood between us...

206
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,617
...you withdraw.

207
00:24:48,721 --> 00:24:51,952
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

208
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,724
...off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

209
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,326
I'm sorry...

210
00:24:56,729 --> 00:24:58,492
...if the goddamn...

211
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,496
...chicken...

212
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,894
...got overcooked.

213
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:00,752
Coffee, sir?

214
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:01,893
Please.

215
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,295
Will you pass the cream?

216
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,004
Thanks.

217
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,333
What'd you get?

218
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:16,439
What?

219
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,010
What are you reading?

220
00:26:24,784 --> 00:26:26,217
Book about metals.

221
00:26:29,989 --> 00:26:31,923
Stress Fractures in Titanium.

222
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:35,955
What kind of work do you do?

223
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:42,363
Lady, why are you so interested in what I read or what I do?

224
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,536
I've seen you in the store.

225
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:49,903
What store?

226
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:52,334
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

227
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:56,737
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

228
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,645
I'm sorry I bothered you.

229
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:12,157
I didn't mean to be rude. I didn't recognize you.

230
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,330
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

231
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,000
My name's Neil.

232
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,502
I'm Eady.

233
00:27:26,345 --> 00:27:27,937
You like working there?

234
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:30,774
Sure.

235
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:35,181
I get a discount and there's a whole section of books in my area.

236
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:36,446
What area?

237
00:27:36,956 --> 00:27:38,423
Graphic design.

238
00:27:39,358 --> 00:27:42,418
I do letterheads and logotypes at night and...

239
00:27:43,128 --> 00:27:46,029
...the store's a day job until I get enough going.

240
00:27:46,198 --> 00:27:47,790
Who do you do that for?

241
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:52,337
A restaurant.

242
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,773
I did their menus, and...

243
00:27:54,773 --> 00:28:00,177
...a small record label.

244
00:28:00,813 --> 00:28:01,871
CDs.

245
00:28:02,381 --> 00:28:04,178
I've done two so far.

246
00:28:06,485 --> 00:28:08,214
You go to school for that?

247
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:09,688
Yeah.

248
00:28:10,823 --> 00:28:12,222
I went to Parsons.

249
00:28:12,324 --> 00:28:13,552
Where's that?

250
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,020
New York City.

251
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:17,421
How long you been here?

252
00:28:18,497 --> 00:28:19,896
About a year.

253
00:28:20,866 --> 00:28:21,833
Like it?

254
00:28:23,836 --> 00:28:26,669
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

255
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,075
Live in this neighborhood?

256
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,946
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

257
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,805
It's a little house I rent.

258
00:28:42,855 --> 00:28:47,588
And it's kind of rundown, but a beautiful, beautiful view.

259
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:49,856
What about you?

260
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,191
I live up here.

261
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:52,996
That's very funny.

262
00:28:57,102 --> 00:28:59,434
Where's your family from originally?

263
00:29:00,005 --> 00:29:03,704
They're Scots-lrish.

264
00:29:04,543 --> 00:29:08,602
They emigrated to Appalachia...in the late 1700s.

265
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,050
Where are you from?

266
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:15,117
The Bay area.

267
00:29:16,555 --> 00:29:17,954
Your folks there?

268
00:29:20,993 --> 00:29:23,461
My mother died a long time ago, and my father...

269
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:25,154
...I don't know where he is.

270
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,891
Got a brother somewhere.

271
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:34,729
You have a tight family. I can tell.

272
00:29:36,075 --> 00:29:37,133
Right?

273
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,640
You're right.

274
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,081
City of lights...

275
00:29:53,492 --> 00:29:55,084
In Fiji, they have these...

276
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,857
...iridescent algae that come out once a year in the water.

277
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:02,294
That's what it looks like out there.

278
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,833
You been there?

279
00:30:06,171 --> 00:30:08,105
No, I'm going there some day.

280
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:18,547
You travel a lot?

281
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:22,317
Yeah.

282
00:30:22,888 --> 00:30:24,685
Travelling makes you lonely?

283
00:30:29,862 --> 00:30:31,762
I'm alone. I am not...

284
00:30:32,197 --> 00:30:33,528
...lonely.

285
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:34,924
You?

286
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,934
Real lonely.

287
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,155
Albert!

288
00:32:46,899 --> 00:32:47,991
Shit!

289
00:32:48,834 --> 00:32:51,496
What you doing here? You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

290
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,735
You were supposed to get back to me.

291
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:56,738
Where the fuck you been?

292
00:32:57,743 --> 00:32:59,335
I couldn't break free.

293
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:01,470
Let's violate his ass right now.

294
00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:03,137
I do for you...

295
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,815
...you don't do for me, is that it?

296
00:33:06,485 --> 00:33:10,922
Listen, man. I swear, I was out all night. I'm hidden like a Flamingo matador.

297
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,421
That's got nothing to do with me.

298
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:18,255
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

299
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,761
You bullshit.

300
00:33:19,932 --> 00:33:22,423
I paged your ass all day. I hate fucking paging.

301
00:33:22,501 --> 00:33:25,095
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.

302
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:28,105
Where's your empathy? It's a substance abuse problem.

303
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:31,836
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

304
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:33,603
You fall in love?

305
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,797
Did you fall in love...

306
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:38,577
...and went off somewhere?

307
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:40,914
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

308
00:33:43,121 --> 00:33:44,588
Give me all you got!

309
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,519
Give me all you got!

310
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:50,457
I swear, my brother Richard's going to talk to you.

311
00:33:50,696 --> 00:33:52,288
I heard Richard?

312
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:54,727
He's going to talk to you.

313
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:58,129
He's gonna meet you tonight.

314
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,727
He's not here, is he?

315
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,272
No, he'll meet you tonight.

316
00:34:01,373 --> 00:34:02,897
What happened to now?

317
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:06,871
I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.

318
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,012
Bullshit.

319
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,113
I swear. He said no...

320
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:12,134
...'cause he in PhoeniX.

321
00:34:12,184 --> 00:34:15,116
"By the time I get to PhoeniX

322
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:17,416
"He'll be rising

323
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,888
"He'll probably leave a note

324
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:22,818
"Right on the door"

325
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:25,055
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

326
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:30,498
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

327
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,662
At 2:00 a.m.

328
00:34:33,005 --> 00:34:33,835
Be there.

329
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,497
You be there too.

330
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,392
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

331
00:34:37,442 --> 00:34:41,444
I got things to do, I got places to be.

332
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:43,840
Be there.

333
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,585
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

334
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:57,521
What is it?

335
00:34:59,264 --> 00:35:00,526
It's a bank.

336
00:35:01,033 --> 00:35:04,469
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...

337
00:35:04,536 --> 00:35:06,629
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

338
00:35:06,705 --> 00:35:09,936
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.

339
00:35:10,042 --> 00:35:11,566
On the prowl or strong?

340
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:12,701
Through the door.

341
00:35:12,778 --> 00:35:14,109
How many guys?

342
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,874
About four, or three, plus a driver. You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

343
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:21,407
You want $100,000 in advance against a ten-percent cut for that?

344
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,883
Sounds like a cowboy score.

345
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:27,651
They hit the hold-up alarms, I gotta get out before the cops show.

346
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,792
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

347
00:35:31,063 --> 00:35:32,894
Two Telco and a cellular.

348
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:37,630
But the signals aren't going anywhere because...

349
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,561
...the night before...

350
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,136
...you cut in...

351
00:35:41,306 --> 00:35:43,900
...and trick out the alarm system computer...

352
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:45,407
...to turn itself...

353
00:35:45,477 --> 00:35:47,570
...and the video recorders off...

354
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,881
...20 minutes before you enter.

355
00:35:50,415 --> 00:35:52,474
Architectural, electrical plans?

356
00:35:52,651 --> 00:35:53,640
I got that.

357
00:35:53,752 --> 00:35:56,721
I got the boards already built. They go into the CPU.

358
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,557
What's the estimate?

359
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,655
12.1, 12.2 million.

360
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,258
You're on.

361
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,664
Congratulations.

362
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:15,637
Let me give you a little idea of where my estimates come from.

363
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:18,506
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

364
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:22,677
My way, you get 100 percent from the insurance company...take the bonds back from us...

365
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:27,343
...at 60 cents on the dollar and make yourself another 40 percent.

366
00:36:29,354 --> 00:36:31,982
The operation doesn't skip a beat. We all make out.

367
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,624
Sure, you got a deal.

368
00:36:34,893 --> 00:36:38,761
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets upset.

369
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,094
You have your man call me and we'll set the meet.

370
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,560
Yeah, okay.

371
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,836
Nice talking to you.

372
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:48,568
You gonna deal with these guys?

373
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,541
Word's on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.

374
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,278
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

375
00:36:54,413 --> 00:36:57,974
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Island's Offshore.

376
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,439
That's not really an estimate. Those are eXact figures.

377
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:08,653
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow for the past two months.

378
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:10,592
How'd you get this information?

379
00:37:10,662 --> 00:37:12,027
Just comes to you.

380
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,615
This stuff just flies through the air.

381
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:18,129
It's just beamed out all over the place. You just have to grab it.

382
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,828
I know how to grab it.

383
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:27,371
Okay, here we go.

384
00:37:27,913 --> 00:37:29,380
13.9 million.

385
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,485
- I bought it. - Good.

386
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,387
What did I tell you?

387
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,159
Here.

388
00:37:42,427 --> 00:37:45,328
We're on. Call Van Zant, collect the money.

389
00:37:46,531 --> 00:37:47,691
How is he?

390
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,566
He's a businessman.

391
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,273
Chris is at my place.

392
00:38:32,410 --> 00:38:33,638
What's wrong?

393
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,812
Husband and wife stuff.

394
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:38,109
I'll let him sleep it off.

395
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:53,964
What happened to you?

396
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:00,262
When will you get some furniture?

397
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:02,033
When I get around to it.

398
00:39:04,676 --> 00:39:06,610
Charlene's gonna leave me.

399
00:39:09,014 --> 00:39:09,844
Why?

400
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,277
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

401
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:18,381
With everything we've been doing?

402
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:22,119
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

403
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,996
When you gonna get an old lady?

404
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,791
When I get around to it.

405
00:39:29,167 --> 00:39:31,294
You got something else on the side?

406
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,202
Nothing regular.

407
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:37,301
She got something else on the side?

408
00:39:37,742 --> 00:39:38,709
You sure?

409
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:41,345
Yeah, I'm sure.

410
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,516
I don't know what you're doing.

411
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:50,681
As Jimmy said, " You want to be making moves on the street?

412
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:54,680
"Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life...

413
00:39:54,926 --> 00:39:59,454
"...that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds if you spot the heat around the corner."

414
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,059
Remember that?

415
00:40:08,106 --> 00:40:10,870
For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man.

416
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,289
We take delivery of cash from Van Zant...

417
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,328
...then I drop a deposit on Kelso for this bank.

418
00:40:30,595 --> 00:40:31,960
Bank? What bank?

419
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,228
What about the platinum thing? It's ready to fall.

420
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,200
That goes too. Then the bank.

421
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,739
Want some breakfast?

422
00:40:50,215 --> 00:40:51,614
Are you okay?

423
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,449
Yeah, sugar.

424
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,120
For real.

425
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:03,353
I'll do good.

426
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,028
I'll see you later.

427
00:41:20,912 --> 00:41:22,311
You Solenko?

428
00:41:22,747 --> 00:41:23,907
Don Breedan.

429
00:41:24,015 --> 00:41:28,179
Grierson, my parole officer, told me to come by here, see if you had a job for me.

430
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:30,517
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

431
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:32,317
I'm a great grill man.

432
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,855
Good. Good for you.

433
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,611
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher, bus tables and empty the garbage.

434
00:41:36,661 --> 00:41:41,532
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded, drunk or stealing.

435
00:41:41,633 --> 00:41:43,533
I'll violate you back fast.

436
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:46,499
Twenty-five percent of your take-home kicks back to me.

437
00:41:46,604 --> 00:41:50,836
Rules of the game. Call Grierson, check it out. Change in the back.

438
00:41:57,182 --> 00:41:59,013
What are you waiting for?

439
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,500
Malibu Equity and Investments.

440
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,096
Roger Van Zant.

441
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:23,333
Please hold.

442
00:42:27,078 --> 00:42:28,978
This is Roger Van Zant.

443
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:31,106
I'm supposed to get something.

444
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:34,344
Someone will call you back from another line.

445
00:42:35,854 --> 00:42:38,152
818-133-6089.

446
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:08,282
I got a package for you. There's a drive-in on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.

447
00:43:08,486 --> 00:43:10,454
Just send one man, alone.

448
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,099
- Who was that guy? - Nobody.

449
00:43:38,149 --> 00:43:41,518
- Who was that guy? - Nobody.

450
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,553
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?

451
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:44,848
He's nobody, Neil.

452
00:43:44,923 --> 00:43:48,381
He's a legit liquor salesman from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

453
00:43:48,827 --> 00:43:50,192
Chris will make up.

454
00:43:50,428 --> 00:43:53,090
- It's too late! I'm sick of him! - Shut up!

455
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:57,962
Here's the deal. You'll give Chris one last shot.After that, he fucks up,

456
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:04,601
then I will finance setting you up myself... ...on my own, anywhere you want.

457
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:06,471
Dominick will go with you.

458
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,976
And my word counts. But right now...

459
00:44:09,314 --> 00:44:11,646
...you will give him the chance.

460
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,481
Clean up, go home.

461
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,451
Clean up, go home!

462
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,697
Give me your money.

463
00:45:07,939 --> 00:45:09,998
You'll get smoked with that shit.

464
00:45:10,074 --> 00:45:11,268
Won't be you.

465
00:45:14,445 --> 00:45:16,504
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

466
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:48,939
Vincent, hey, man.

467
00:45:50,948 --> 00:45:54,448
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

468
00:45:54,552 --> 00:45:56,076
It's all right.

469
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,188
What have you got for me?

470
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:04,151
Before we even get into that, there's this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

471
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:07,515
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

472
00:46:07,565 --> 00:46:11,586
...that somebody wants to pay a little visit this weekend...

473
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,799
...they might find two Turbos and a 911 slope.

474
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:18,437
You looking to rid yourself of your competition?

475
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:21,306
I'm a good citizen.

476
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:22,971
I'm Donald Duck.

477
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:25,146
You got something to tell me?

478
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:28,547
Check this out, cuz.

479
00:46:29,454 --> 00:46:32,787
How do I know if I tell you what you need to know...

480
00:46:33,091 --> 00:46:36,077
...that you gonna do what the fuck I need to get done.

481
00:46:36,127 --> 00:46:39,688
Hanna is straight up.

482
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:42,063
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

483
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:44,085
And you know because I say so...

484
00:46:44,135 --> 00:46:47,869
...after I hear what the fuck you got to tell me!

485
00:46:47,939 --> 00:46:48,906
Fuck you.

486
00:46:49,173 --> 00:46:50,470
You understand?

487
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,676
I'd get killed for telling you.

488
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:55,074
You'd get killed walking your doggie!

489
00:46:55,113 --> 00:46:56,478
All right, man...

490
00:46:57,015 --> 00:46:59,415
...there was a cat I was locked up with.

491
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,418
Did a couple of two, three years. He got out. I ran into him.

492
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:07,985
And so?

493
00:47:08,393 --> 00:47:10,520
He's a big fiend for action.

494
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:14,791
Now, if he'd have said nothing, I'd have thought nothing, but...

495
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,325
...he goes on and on, running down to me how he ain't done nothing...

496
00:47:18,403 --> 00:47:21,201
...and nothing's been going on and all this bullshit.

497
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:23,263
Right then and there I know...

498
00:47:23,808 --> 00:47:26,470
...this cat's got something going down.

499
00:47:34,052 --> 00:47:35,781
Pretty fucking great.

500
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:39,752
Albert, what's wrong with you?

501
00:47:40,491 --> 00:47:43,324
You drag me here, waste my time like this.

502
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:46,758
You saw a guy on the street who's an eX-con?

503
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:48,257
That's right.

504
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:49,799
Well, I am...

505
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,729
...over-fucking-whelmed.

506
00:47:52,103 --> 00:47:54,469
What do you want for that, a G-man badge?

507
00:47:55,006 --> 00:47:57,406
You gonna make the call on them Porches?

508
00:47:58,276 --> 00:47:59,641
Is he kidding me?

509
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:02,104
I'm telling you:

510
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,511
Slick is no joke.

511
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,739
He's double time.

512
00:48:05,817 --> 00:48:07,079
Say what?

513
00:48:07,785 --> 00:48:09,753
"Slick." What does that mean?

514
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,321
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

515
00:48:13,925 --> 00:48:15,586
Tell me about him.

516
00:48:17,795 --> 00:48:19,660
About 6 feet tall...

517
00:48:19,931 --> 00:48:21,899
...lots of jailhouse tats.

518
00:48:21,999 --> 00:48:24,160
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

519
00:48:26,671 --> 00:48:28,138
What's his name?

520
00:48:29,207 --> 00:48:30,469
Cheritto.

521
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:32,736
Michael Cheritto.

522
00:48:37,048 --> 00:48:39,278
Thirty-three busts since 1976.

523
00:48:39,784 --> 00:48:42,344
Eleven for armed robbery, three convictions.

524
00:48:42,487 --> 00:48:45,149
Two out of a three-to-five year beef in Attica.

525
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:46,815
Three years in Marion.

526
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:49,893
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back to involuntary manslaughter.

527
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:51,224
Jacket's two inches thick.

528
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:53,263
Who do I have there now?

529
00:48:53,531 --> 00:48:55,283
- Drucker and me. And Schwartz. - Tell SIS...

530
00:48:55,333 --> 00:48:58,853
...I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours. Round the clock, day and night.

531
00:48:58,903 --> 00:49:02,304
We never close. Open every day.

532
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:04,438
Bug the car, the house, the work.

533
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:06,409
When he moves or sits, like in a restaurant......I want pictures of who he moves and sits with.

534
00:49:08,312 --> 00:49:12,066
Then run makes on them. They got jackets, trail them.

535
00:49:12,116 --> 00:49:15,685
I want it up and running by tomorrow night.

536
00:50:11,209 --> 00:50:13,404
Put your hands where I can see them.

537
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,806
Put your hands where I can see them.

538
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:19,944
I tell you what to do.I tell you how to do it.

539
00:50:20,718 --> 00:50:24,154
Now, with your right hand only, your right hand only...

540
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,258
...take the package and throw it in here.

541
00:50:46,344 --> 00:50:48,276
Behind you.On the right.

542
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:09,359
Roger Van Zant.

543
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:11,087
Who's this?

544
00:52:11,562 --> 00:52:13,029
You know who this is.

545
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:15,295
Yes, I do.

546
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:17,768
I sent a guy to deliver the package.

547
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:20,063
He didn't call. Is everything okay?

548
00:52:20,871 --> 00:52:23,135
I tell you what, forget the money.

549
00:52:23,674 --> 00:52:24,572
What?

550
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:27,103
Forget the money.

551
00:52:28,259 --> 00:52:32,246
It's a lot of money. What are you doing? What do you mean, "forget the money"?

552
00:52:32,296 --> 00:52:36,613
What am I doing? I'm talking to an empty telephone.

553
00:52:37,482 --> 00:52:38,949
I don't understand.

554
00:52:39,484 --> 00:52:42,681
'Cause there is a dead man on the other end of this line.

555
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,172
Do you like it?

556
00:53:05,277 --> 00:53:06,676
Look at my ring.

557
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,311
Did you know?

558
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:16,309
You are insane.

559
00:53:21,111 --> 00:53:22,715
Do you like it?

560
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:24,795
- It's beautiful. - It's good.

561
00:53:24,963 --> 00:53:26,897
Don't ask him where he got it.

562
00:53:35,674 --> 00:53:38,040
What do you want to be when you grow up?

563
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:39,604
I don't know.

564
00:53:42,647 --> 00:53:43,484
Just like me.

565
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:45,673
I don't know either.

566
00:54:00,231 --> 00:54:01,323
Hello?

567
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,228
It's me.

568
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:07,028
I was wondering if you'd call.

569
00:54:08,673 --> 00:54:10,004
I've been busy.

570
00:54:10,308 --> 00:54:11,605
Can I see you?

571
00:54:12,043 --> 00:54:13,977
I was afraid that was just...

572
00:54:14,879 --> 00:54:16,471
...the one night.

573
00:54:17,582 --> 00:54:19,447
Not for me, it wasn't.

574
00:54:21,986 --> 00:54:23,453
Yeah, me neither.

575
00:54:25,657 --> 00:54:27,124
Can I fall by?

576
00:54:28,493 --> 00:54:29,585
Yeah.

577
00:54:29,828 --> 00:54:31,728
I'll see you in a little bit.

578
00:54:44,843 --> 00:54:46,003
All right.

579
00:54:46,811 --> 00:54:48,540
Goddamn convention.

580
00:54:49,781 --> 00:54:51,976
- Which one's Slick? - The wide one.

581
00:54:52,283 --> 00:54:54,012
We got two transmitters.

582
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:57,050
One's in the wheel well, backup's in the firewall.

583
00:54:57,122 --> 00:54:58,111
Here we are.

584
00:54:58,223 --> 00:55:00,191
Did you say good night to Neil?

585
00:55:01,025 --> 00:55:02,993
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

586
00:55:03,094 --> 00:55:06,621
SIS has got a revolving tail and hung a wire on the house phone.

587
00:55:08,419 --> 00:55:12,331
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals depository three times.

588
00:55:12,404 --> 00:55:14,736
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

589
00:55:15,673 --> 00:55:18,335
Sammy and I think that's going to be their neXt score.

590
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:19,775
Who's the loner?

591
00:55:22,947 --> 00:55:24,437
First time we're seeing him.

592
00:55:24,549 --> 00:55:26,107
We're not on him yet.

593
00:55:28,253 --> 00:55:29,584
Get on it.

594
00:55:47,372 --> 00:55:52,105
When these guys walk out the door of whatever score they're gonna take neXt...

595
00:55:54,012 --> 00:55:57,175
...they're gonna have the surprise of a lifetime.

596
00:56:12,931 --> 00:56:14,558
Baby, time to go.

597
00:56:16,167 --> 00:56:18,567
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

598
00:56:22,073 --> 00:56:23,267
You fly.

599
00:56:23,441 --> 00:56:24,703
You cool.

600
00:56:32,317 --> 00:56:36,048
You're lying to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.

601
00:56:36,921 --> 00:56:38,286
I ain't lying.

602
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,457
You a hot dog.

603
00:56:41,092 --> 00:56:42,957
A regular rodeo rider.

604
00:56:43,595 --> 00:56:46,655
And this was the monster fuck of my young life.

605
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:54,000
Now, I got to get my ass street-side, sugar.

606
00:56:54,038 --> 00:56:56,302
You don't have a truth-telling style.

607
00:56:56,474 --> 00:56:58,271
What are you talking about?

608
00:56:58,443 --> 00:57:00,570
You don't know what this is.

609
00:57:07,085 --> 00:57:09,553
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

610
00:57:28,473 --> 00:57:29,872
Where have you been?

611
00:57:31,276 --> 00:57:33,005
SHU at Pelican Bay.

612
00:57:33,344 --> 00:57:35,073
And Folsom, B-wing.

613
00:57:36,114 --> 00:57:37,706
I am a cowboy...

614
00:57:38,383 --> 00:57:40,283
...looking for anything heavy.

615
00:57:40,385 --> 00:57:42,478
Billy said to come see you.

616
00:57:43,221 --> 00:57:45,086
That is why I am here.

617
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:56,782
Why don't you call this guy?

618
00:57:57,802 --> 00:58:00,066
This guy's always putting guys on.

619
00:58:04,242 --> 00:58:05,300
Thank you.

620
00:58:19,691 --> 00:58:21,591
You're perfect for each other.

621
00:58:27,398 --> 00:58:29,298
I knew a guy in grade school.

622
00:58:29,634 --> 00:58:31,829
His name was Raoul... whatever.

623
00:58:32,036 --> 00:58:35,631
You could take his fingers and fold them over each other.

624
00:58:35,907 --> 00:58:37,966
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

625
00:58:38,042 --> 00:58:41,068
I can't keep my hands off you. That's the truth.

626
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:45,242
That's what's so wonderful about you in that...

627
00:58:45,316 --> 00:58:46,977
...bestial sort of way.

628
00:58:51,656 --> 00:58:52,782
Woman.

629
00:58:59,597 --> 00:59:01,565
This better be earth-shattering.

630
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:09,838
This is to Raoul.

631
00:59:12,176 --> 00:59:13,837
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

632
00:59:56,154 --> 00:59:57,985
Here's how we found her.

633
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,158
How old?

634
01:00:03,227 --> 01:00:05,889
16, 17. Been here about siX hours.

635
01:00:07,098 --> 01:00:08,565
How'd she die?

636
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:12,067
Beat her head in, same as the others. Cerebral hematoma.

637
01:00:14,939 --> 01:00:16,099
Who's that?

638
01:00:16,641 --> 01:00:17,972
Mother and siblings.

639
01:00:18,042 --> 01:00:19,046
- Why are they here? - It's fucked up.

640
01:00:19,096 --> 01:00:22,879
Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.

641
01:00:24,015 --> 01:00:25,175
Let's go.

642
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:31,013
Nice.

643
01:00:31,923 --> 01:00:35,882
My intuition says the check on the semen will show it's the same guy...

644
01:00:35,993 --> 01:00:39,087
...so it's a series and ending up in your court.

645
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:41,022
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

646
01:00:41,099 --> 01:00:42,327
Not yet.

647
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:45,168
Get off of me!

648
01:00:48,106 --> 01:00:49,368
Oh, my God!

649
01:00:53,678 --> 01:00:54,481
Where is she?

650
01:00:54,531 --> 01:00:56,771
Easy, easy, easy.

651
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:01,518
Please, come on.

652
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:06,287
It's okay. It's okay.

653
01:01:06,476 --> 01:01:10,387
Where is my baby? Where is she?

654
01:01:11,229 --> 01:01:13,424
I need to know what happened.

655
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,733
I guess the earth shattered.

656
01:01:58,543 --> 01:02:01,341
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

657
01:02:03,247 --> 01:02:05,545
I didn't want to ruin their night too.

658
01:02:05,983 --> 01:02:07,314
What was it?

659
01:02:09,387 --> 01:02:10,877
You don't want to know.

660
01:02:10,988 --> 01:02:13,327
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look on your face.

661
01:02:13,377 --> 01:02:16,730
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

662
01:02:16,780 --> 01:02:20,079
You never told me I'd be eXcluded.

663
01:02:21,999 --> 01:02:23,437
I told you when we hooked up...

664
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,332
...that you were gonna have to share me...

665
01:02:26,404 --> 01:02:30,170
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.

666
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:32,502
And I bought into that sharing...

667
01:02:32,777 --> 01:02:34,404
...because I love you.

668
01:02:34,846 --> 01:02:38,577
I love you fat, bald, money, no money, driving a bus.

669
01:02:38,716 --> 01:02:39,910
I don't care.

670
01:02:41,085 --> 01:02:42,622
But you have got to be present like a normal guy.

671
01:02:42,672 --> 01:02:47,006
That's sharing. This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

672
01:02:47,091 --> 01:02:49,719
What I should do is come home and say:

673
01:02:50,595 --> 01:02:54,087
"Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...

674
01:02:54,198 --> 01:02:58,259
"...where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...

675
01:02:58,369 --> 01:03:01,827
"...because he was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.

676
01:03:01,906 --> 01:03:04,739
"Come on, let's share that and in sharing it...

677
01:03:04,942 --> 01:03:09,436
"...we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit."

678
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:11,046
Right?

679
01:03:13,618 --> 01:03:14,585
Wrong.

680
01:03:14,919 --> 01:03:16,113
You know why?

681
01:03:16,187 --> 01:03:18,325
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

682
01:03:18,375 --> 01:03:20,790
We fuck and you don't speak.

683
01:03:20,858 --> 01:03:23,019
'Cause I got to hold onto my angst.

684
01:03:23,628 --> 01:03:25,061
I preserve it...

685
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:28,596
...because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

686
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:30,397
Where I gotta be.

687
01:03:37,742 --> 01:03:39,471
You don't live with me.

688
01:03:42,046 --> 01:03:44,708
You live among the remains of dead people.

689
01:03:48,653 --> 01:03:50,848
You sift through the detritus.You read the terrain.

690
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:54,060
You search for signs of passing...

691
01:03:54,729 --> 01:03:56,788
...for the scent of your prey...

692
01:03:56,864 --> 01:03:58,832
...and then you hunt them down.

693
01:04:00,468 --> 01:04:03,164
That's the only thing you're committed to.

694
01:04:06,608 --> 01:04:09,475
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.

695
01:04:14,749 --> 01:04:18,185
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.

696
01:04:37,939 --> 01:04:39,429
Let's go, baby.

697
01:04:42,277 --> 01:04:43,938
I met the manager.

698
01:04:44,345 --> 01:04:45,812
Is that the boss?

699
01:04:46,948 --> 01:04:49,167
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.

700
01:04:49,217 --> 01:04:53,779
Can you just handle it till we find you something new?

701
01:04:54,789 --> 01:04:56,381
Can you do that?

702
01:04:58,459 --> 01:05:01,428
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.

703
01:05:07,535 --> 01:05:09,435
What you're hanging with me for?

704
01:05:11,239 --> 01:05:13,139
Because I'm proud of you.

705
01:05:19,047 --> 01:05:20,514
You're proud of me?

706
01:05:25,486 --> 01:05:27,579
Why the hell are you proud of me?

707
01:05:29,157 --> 01:05:30,556
Come on home.

708
01:05:41,402 --> 01:05:43,131
What were you doing there?

709
01:05:43,338 --> 01:05:44,805
I was skiing.

710
01:05:45,006 --> 01:05:46,769
I was trying to ski.

711
01:05:47,575 --> 01:05:49,761
That's what people do there. You go skiing...

712
01:05:49,811 --> 01:05:53,177
...and you meet people.

713
01:05:53,514 --> 01:05:55,106
You try to have a good time.

714
01:05:55,183 --> 01:05:56,844
- Did you have a good time? - No.

715
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:58,078
Why not?

716
01:05:58,419 --> 01:06:00,387
I'm not good at meeting people.

717
01:06:00,855 --> 01:06:02,220
You met me.

718
01:06:02,990 --> 01:06:05,458
That happened without my thinking about it.

719
01:06:05,927 --> 01:06:07,861
Which is why I probably...

720
01:06:08,496 --> 01:06:10,555
No, it's because you are fine.

721
01:06:13,267 --> 01:06:17,861
Take off with me for a while.

722
01:06:19,273 --> 01:06:20,205
Where?

723
01:06:20,808 --> 01:06:22,207
New Zealand.

724
01:06:23,511 --> 01:06:24,603
When?

725
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:28,874
I have to go separate. You can meet me there.

726
01:06:29,384 --> 01:06:30,851
But my job...

727
01:06:30,952 --> 01:06:33,113
I got money. You don't need money.

728
01:06:33,221 --> 01:06:35,689
You could set up a studio and work there.

729
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:37,318
I don't know.

730
01:06:37,392 --> 01:06:38,916
What's there to know?

731
01:06:39,060 --> 01:06:40,527
Are you married?

732
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,222
What?

733
01:06:43,398 --> 01:06:45,457
The last thing I am is married.

734
01:06:45,633 --> 01:06:47,985
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way.

735
01:06:48,035 --> 01:06:50,431
Then, all of a sudden...

736
01:06:51,339 --> 01:06:53,398
...someone like you comes along.

737
01:06:57,078 --> 01:06:58,045
You don't know me.

738
01:06:58,112 --> 01:06:59,579
I know enough.

739
01:07:03,584 --> 01:07:04,983
Come with me.

740
01:07:14,862 --> 01:07:16,329
What's wrong?

741
01:07:18,099 --> 01:07:20,932
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?

742
01:07:25,873 --> 01:07:26,931
Yeah.

743
01:07:30,678 --> 01:07:31,645
Good.

744
01:07:56,637 --> 01:07:58,036
Hi, sweetie.

745
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:01,875
You forget your mom was picking you up?

746
01:08:03,578 --> 01:08:04,567
No.

747
01:08:06,714 --> 01:08:08,477
So, what's going on?

748
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:12,047
I felt like being alone.

749
01:08:14,255 --> 01:08:16,889
Come on, I'll drive you home.

750
01:09:13,648 --> 01:09:14,842
What's happening?

751
01:09:16,117 --> 01:09:17,748
Sir.

752
01:09:17,818 --> 01:09:20,480
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

753
01:09:21,022 --> 01:09:23,456
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

754
01:10:17,778 --> 01:10:19,040
Technique.

755
01:10:38,566 --> 01:10:40,557
Open Sesame. Right there.

756
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:39,758
There he is.

757
01:12:42,490 --> 01:12:43,218
We walk!

758
01:12:43,290 --> 01:12:44,120
I'm there.

759
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:45,158
We walk!

760
01:13:00,508 --> 01:13:01,839
He's heard it.

761
01:13:10,251 --> 01:13:13,137
Heads up.

762
01:13:13,187 --> 01:13:15,314
- One's coming out. - Hold it, Captain.

763
01:13:15,389 --> 01:13:17,653
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

764
01:13:17,958 --> 01:13:18,925
I see.

765
01:13:22,163 --> 01:13:22,813
- Here we go. - Not till my boss says so.

766
01:13:22,863 --> 01:13:27,323
Both of them are not carrying anything.

767
01:13:36,010 --> 01:13:37,194
- Let them go. - What do you mean?

768
01:13:37,244 --> 01:13:38,429
We can take them on!

769
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:40,208
On what?

770
01:13:40,381 --> 01:13:42,212
They didn't steal anything.

771
01:13:42,516 --> 01:13:46,976
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor, they do siX months and they're out.

772
01:13:47,321 --> 01:13:48,447
No fucking way.

773
01:13:48,522 --> 01:13:51,787
I'm not taking the heat from my boss. They are not walking.

774
01:13:51,859 --> 01:13:55,454
That's eXactly what they'll do. They'll walk. This is my operation.

775
01:13:55,529 --> 01:13:58,327
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.

776
01:13:58,399 --> 01:14:01,562
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck!

777
01:14:47,448 --> 01:14:48,915
Back to work.

778
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:54,480
LAPD, the G, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?

779
01:14:55,089 --> 01:14:58,058
Maybe it's the score they were onto. The place, not us.

780
01:14:58,158 --> 01:15:00,626
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

781
01:15:00,828 --> 01:15:04,992
Assume they got our phones, our houses. Assume they got us right here, right now...

782
01:15:05,065 --> 01:15:07,533
...as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

783
01:15:08,035 --> 01:15:10,128
How are we gonna buy the bank package?

784
01:15:10,204 --> 01:15:11,728
I'll front that.

785
01:15:11,839 --> 01:15:13,568
What if Van Zant has 750?

786
01:15:13,774 --> 01:15:17,642
With the heat we got, you want to play World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

787
01:15:17,711 --> 01:15:19,372
No, I want my 750.

788
01:15:19,947 --> 01:15:24,213
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luXury.

789
01:15:24,285 --> 01:15:26,947
Our problem is to take the bank, or split right now.

790
01:15:27,054 --> 01:15:29,249
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

791
01:15:29,623 --> 01:15:34,083
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways. That's it.

792
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:41,167
The bank is worth the risk.

793
01:15:41,435 --> 01:15:42,902
I need it, brother.

794
01:15:44,571 --> 01:15:47,768
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.

795
01:15:58,786 --> 01:16:00,879
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

796
01:16:01,422 --> 01:16:03,173
- Whatever. - Not on this one.

797
01:16:03,223 --> 01:16:05,191
On this one, you're on your own.

798
01:16:18,172 --> 01:16:20,572
You figure this is the best thing to do?

799
01:16:20,741 --> 01:16:22,793
This is the best thing to do?

800
01:16:22,843 --> 01:16:26,897
I've got plans, I'm going away after, so the reward is worth the stretch.

801
01:16:26,947 --> 01:16:30,007
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.

802
01:16:30,084 --> 01:16:32,279
You got T-bonds, real estate.

803
01:16:32,386 --> 01:16:35,219
If I were you, I would be smart and cut loose of this.

804
01:16:53,474 --> 01:16:54,736
For me...

805
01:16:54,942 --> 01:16:57,035
...the action is the juice.

806
01:16:57,678 --> 01:16:58,645
I'm in.

807
01:17:04,618 --> 01:17:05,983
Yeah, sure.

808
01:17:06,153 --> 01:17:07,245
Let's go.

809
01:17:08,055 --> 01:17:09,886
Fuck them, let's do it.

810
01:17:10,057 --> 01:17:12,355
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

811
01:17:25,672 --> 01:17:27,003


812
01:17:29,676 --> 01:17:31,507
Tim, I gotta call you back.

813
01:17:31,845 --> 01:17:34,211
- Can I help you? - Are you Alan Marciano?

814
01:17:34,415 --> 01:17:35,746
Who the fuck are you?

815
01:17:35,816 --> 01:17:36,976
Who am I?

816
01:17:37,718 --> 01:17:39,948
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

817
01:17:40,020 --> 01:17:43,456
LA? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.

818
01:17:44,892 --> 01:17:48,453
Do you know who the fuck you're pushing around? I know people here.

819
01:17:48,662 --> 01:17:51,130
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

820
01:17:53,133 --> 01:17:57,297
You are eXtradited to Newark on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

821
01:17:57,337 --> 01:17:59,567
...up from North Carolina three years ago...

822
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,608
...or you go to work for us.

823
01:18:02,009 --> 01:18:03,476
Cut and dried.

824
01:18:03,944 --> 01:18:05,309
That is it.

825
01:18:05,612 --> 01:18:06,704
Shit.

826
01:18:07,681 --> 01:18:09,410
Charlene Shiherlis.

827
01:18:09,917 --> 01:18:10,747
Who?

828
01:18:10,918 --> 01:18:11,782
Who?

829
01:18:12,186 --> 01:18:14,104
What are you, a fucking owl?

830
01:18:14,154 --> 01:18:18,090
The lady you been talking dirty to on the telephone every day last week.

831
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:20,153
You can't tie me to her.

832
01:18:20,494 --> 01:18:24,521
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jackoff.

833
01:18:25,699 --> 01:18:28,552
Why did I get miXed up with her?

834
01:18:28,602 --> 01:18:31,070
Because she got a great ass!

835
01:18:32,840 --> 01:18:35,570
And you got your head all the way up it.

836
01:18:36,677 --> 01:18:37,644
Jesus.

837
01:18:38,278 --> 01:18:39,745
Ferocious, aren't I?

838
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,011
When I think of asses...

839
01:18:42,082 --> 01:18:43,549
...a woman's ass...

840
01:18:44,118 --> 01:18:46,018
...something comes out of me.

841
01:18:47,521 --> 01:18:48,180
So?

842
01:18:48,255 --> 01:18:49,620
So, no big thing.

843
01:18:50,591 --> 01:18:52,058
All I want...

844
01:18:52,392 --> 01:18:55,054
...is her husband and his whole fucking crew.

845
01:18:55,762 --> 01:18:57,525
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

846
01:19:02,035 --> 01:19:04,367
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

847
01:19:04,771 --> 01:19:07,740
...that's where we cut through the fence. That's the access.

848
01:19:07,808 --> 01:19:08,775
Right.

849
01:19:09,042 --> 01:19:11,567
The security systems around here are a joke.

850
01:19:16,450 --> 01:19:19,283
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge, that's escape route number one.

851
01:19:20,220 --> 01:19:21,187
Number two:

852
01:19:21,321 --> 01:19:23,289
Over here. Anaheim to the 110.

853
01:19:23,857 --> 01:19:24,575
Good.

854
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:26,123
You got it?

855
01:19:26,193 --> 01:19:27,592
Good. Let's go.

856
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,842
They were looking back...

857
01:19:53,287 --> 01:19:54,845
...in this direction.

858
01:19:55,622 --> 01:19:57,419
A container facility?

859
01:19:57,491 --> 01:19:59,015
What? Cartage theft?

860
01:19:59,092 --> 01:20:02,027
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

861
01:20:05,399 --> 01:20:08,297
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

862
01:20:08,335 --> 01:20:09,700
Refinery pays by check.

863
01:20:09,770 --> 01:20:11,067
No cash around.

864
01:20:11,371 --> 01:20:12,929
Same for the scrap yard.

865
01:20:16,443 --> 01:20:17,774
Stealing hubcaps?

866
01:20:21,915 --> 01:20:24,042
A refinery and a scrap yard.

867
01:20:25,485 --> 01:20:27,112
What the hell is going on?

868
01:20:27,187 --> 01:20:29,280
That's what we are trying to figure out.

869
01:20:30,123 --> 01:20:31,920
We thought we had it.

870
01:20:32,659 --> 01:20:34,024
Thought we had it.

871
01:20:43,670 --> 01:20:45,262
I got an idea...

872
01:20:46,206 --> 01:20:48,140
...on what they're looking at.

873
01:20:51,812 --> 01:20:54,076
Want to know what they're looking at?

874
01:20:55,882 --> 01:20:58,783
I mean, is this guy something, or is he something?

875
01:21:00,287 --> 01:21:01,948
This crew is good.

876
01:21:04,625 --> 01:21:05,785
You want to know?

877
01:21:07,027 --> 01:21:08,119
What?

878
01:21:09,496 --> 01:21:10,485
Us.

879
01:21:11,965 --> 01:21:13,227
The LAPD.

880
01:21:14,067 --> 01:21:15,932
The police department.

881
01:21:17,271 --> 01:21:18,738
We just got made.

882
01:21:26,847 --> 01:21:27,939
Yeah!

883
01:21:36,490 --> 01:21:37,582
Okay!

884
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:48,768
Okay, motherfucker!

885
01:22:09,656 --> 01:22:11,123
Kelso come through?

886
01:22:11,491 --> 01:22:13,959
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

887
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,433
Name is Hanna.

888
01:22:21,735 --> 01:22:23,202
First name, Vincent.

889
01:22:23,837 --> 01:22:25,828
I smeared this sergeant five yards.

890
01:22:25,906 --> 01:22:27,396
Hanna's all over you.

891
01:22:28,241 --> 01:22:31,005
He's on all the work cars. Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

892
01:22:31,078 --> 01:22:33,512
Not yours. They've been losing you at night.

893
01:22:33,580 --> 01:22:34,877
He's a hot dog.

894
01:22:35,115 --> 01:22:37,413
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

895
01:22:38,018 --> 01:22:39,849
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

896
01:22:39,920 --> 01:22:43,515
He's taken down some heavy crews. He blew away Frankie in Chicago.

897
01:22:43,590 --> 01:22:45,251
He was a fucking maniac.

898
01:22:46,126 --> 01:22:48,390
He was working narcotics before that.

899
01:22:48,862 --> 01:22:51,228
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

900
01:22:51,298 --> 01:22:52,959
He's why the eXtra heat.

901
01:22:55,769 --> 01:22:57,430
The vice sergeant...

902
01:22:58,772 --> 01:23:00,706
...says Hanna likes you...

903
01:23:01,708 --> 01:23:04,227
...thinks you're some kind of star. You do this sharp, that sharp.

904
01:23:04,277 --> 01:23:07,680
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

905
01:23:10,117 --> 01:23:11,641
Funny as a heart attack.

906
01:23:11,718 --> 01:23:15,245
Three marriages? Do you think that means he likes staying home?

907
01:23:15,956 --> 01:23:18,424
Means he's one of those guys out there...

908
01:23:18,625 --> 01:23:21,355
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

909
01:23:23,697 --> 01:23:26,131
With him and this much heat, you should pass.

910
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,067
It's worth the stretch.

911
01:23:36,042 --> 01:23:38,010
This guy can hit or miss.

912
01:23:38,478 --> 01:23:40,139
You can't miss once.

913
01:23:40,947 --> 01:23:42,107
You sure?

914
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,581
I am sure.

915
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:51,857
Let's go to the garage.

916
01:24:20,487 --> 01:24:21,954
Where are we going?

917
01:24:27,093 --> 01:24:28,560
Where are you going?

918
01:24:29,062 --> 01:24:30,120
Out.

919
01:25:28,788 --> 01:25:29,846
What are they on?

920
01:25:29,923 --> 01:25:31,185
TAC 9.

921
01:25:33,059 --> 01:25:35,178
They're northbound out LAX on the 405.

922
01:25:35,228 --> 01:25:37,492
We got four ground units.

923
01:25:55,715 --> 01:25:57,734
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.

924
01:25:57,784 --> 01:25:58,682
Who have I got?

925
01:25:58,818 --> 01:26:00,786
This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.

926
01:26:01,021 --> 01:26:02,806
Richard Glover's with me.

927
01:26:02,856 --> 01:26:04,483
It's on the 105 eastbound...

928
01:26:04,824 --> 01:26:06,587
...approaching the 110.

929
01:26:07,494 --> 01:26:08,825
Revolving tail?

930
01:26:09,129 --> 01:26:11,723
I got two units in front, three behind.

931
01:26:11,998 --> 01:26:15,263
Have one of them pick me up at the Vermont on-ramp.

932
01:26:16,236 --> 01:26:17,498
Let's go.

933
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:11,216
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I close or far, or what?

934
01:27:11,691 --> 01:27:13,750
Three hundred yards, center lane.

935
01:28:20,894 --> 01:28:22,225
How're you doing?

936
01:28:25,899 --> 01:28:28,561
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

937
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:36,372
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

938
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:38,372
Follow me.

939
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:56,025
Seven years in Folsom.

940
01:28:56,763 --> 01:28:58,594
In the hole for three.

941
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:00,199
McNeil before that.

942
01:29:03,536 --> 01:29:05,504
McNeil as tough as they say?

943
01:29:06,740 --> 01:29:08,708
You looking to become a penologist?

944
01:29:09,943 --> 01:29:11,604
You looking to go back?

945
01:29:11,845 --> 01:29:15,906
I chased down some crews. Guys just looking to fuck up, get busted back.

946
01:29:16,082 --> 01:29:17,174
That you?

947
01:29:18,384 --> 01:29:20,682
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

948
01:29:21,421 --> 01:29:23,150
I worked all kinds.

949
01:29:26,493 --> 01:29:30,429
You see me doing liquor store holdup with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

950
01:29:31,698 --> 01:29:32,665
I do not.

951
01:29:33,266 --> 01:29:34,233
Right.

952
01:29:35,835 --> 01:29:37,666
I am never going back.

953
01:29:39,339 --> 01:29:41,466
Then don't take down scores.

954
01:29:42,742 --> 01:29:44,403
I do what I do best.

955
01:29:44,577 --> 01:29:48,513
I take scores. You do what you do best: Try to stop guys like me.

956
01:29:52,385 --> 01:29:54,649
You never wanted a regular type life?

957
01:29:55,421 --> 01:29:58,117
What is that? The barbecues and the ball games?

958
01:30:00,193 --> 01:30:01,125
Yeah.

959
01:30:03,596 --> 01:30:05,655
This regular type like your life?

960
01:30:06,366 --> 01:30:08,334
My life? No, my life...

961
01:30:10,103 --> 01:30:11,798
My life's a disaster zone.

962
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,165
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

963
01:30:16,709 --> 01:30:19,803
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.

964
01:30:19,879 --> 01:30:21,176
I got a wife.

965
01:30:21,247 --> 01:30:25,045
We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage.My third.

966
01:30:27,287 --> 01:30:31,053
Because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.

967
01:30:31,124 --> 01:30:32,455
That's my life.

968
01:30:38,965 --> 01:30:40,728
Guy told me one time:

969
01:30:42,535 --> 01:30:45,889
"Don't get attached to anything you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

970
01:30:45,939 --> 01:30:49,508
"...if you feel the heat around the corner."

971
01:30:50,977 --> 01:30:54,174
If you're on me and you got to move when I move...

972
01:30:54,547 --> 01:30:57,277
...how do you eXpect to keep a marriage?

973
01:30:59,419 --> 01:31:01,250
That's an interesting point.

974
01:31:02,789 --> 01:31:04,017
What are you, a monk?

975
01:31:05,391 --> 01:31:06,653
I have a woman.

976
01:31:07,193 --> 01:31:08,660
What do you tell her?

977
01:31:11,097 --> 01:31:12,826
I tell her I'm a salesman.

978
01:31:19,606 --> 01:31:22,666
So, if you spot me coming around that corner...

979
01:31:23,676 --> 01:31:25,576
...you'll just walk out on her?

980
01:31:27,113 --> 01:31:28,740
Not say good-bye?

981
01:31:29,515 --> 01:31:31,176
That's the discipline.

982
01:31:32,018 --> 01:31:33,815
That's pretty vacant.

983
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:35,647
It is what it is.

984
01:31:35,788 --> 01:31:38,586
It's that, or we both better go do something else.

985
01:31:40,560 --> 01:31:42,528
I don't know how to do anything else.

986
01:31:43,029 --> 01:31:44,462
Neither do I.

987
01:31:47,267 --> 01:31:48,825
I don't want to either.

988
01:31:49,602 --> 01:31:50,796
Neither do I.

989
01:31:58,511 --> 01:32:01,105
You know, I have this recurring dream.

990
01:32:02,982 --> 01:32:05,951
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

991
01:32:06,019 --> 01:32:09,648
...all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting there...

992
01:32:09,722 --> 01:32:13,317
...and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...

993
01:32:14,294 --> 01:32:18,230
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.

994
01:32:19,499 --> 01:32:22,559
And there they are, these big balloon people...

995
01:32:23,269 --> 01:32:26,466
...because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.

996
01:32:27,240 --> 01:32:29,708
The neighbors reported the smell...

997
01:32:30,109 --> 01:32:32,338
...and there they are...

998
01:32:32,412 --> 01:32:34,141
...all just sitting there.

999
01:32:36,349 --> 01:32:37,543
What do they say?

1000
01:32:39,585 --> 01:32:40,552
Nothing.

1001
01:32:41,020 --> 01:32:42,248
No talk?

1002
01:32:42,855 --> 01:32:46,187
They have nothing to say.

1003
01:32:47,093 --> 01:32:49,061
We just look at each other.

1004
01:32:50,029 --> 01:32:51,690
They look at me...

1005
01:32:52,198 --> 01:32:54,359
...and that's it. That's the dream.

1006
01:32:57,203 --> 01:32:59,103
I have one where I'm drowning.

1007
01:32:59,839 --> 01:33:03,502
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing or I'll die in my sleep.

1008
01:33:05,611 --> 01:33:06,976
What's that about?

1009
01:33:07,547 --> 01:33:10,047
Having enough time.

1010
01:33:11,718 --> 01:33:12,946
Enough time...

1011
01:33:13,353 --> 01:33:15,116
...to do what you want to do?

1012
01:33:15,288 --> 01:33:16,550
That's right.

1013
01:33:19,058 --> 01:33:20,457
You doing it now?

1014
01:33:20,593 --> 01:33:21,855
No, not yet.

1015
01:33:27,467 --> 01:33:29,435
You know, we're sitting here...

1016
01:33:30,803 --> 01:33:33,033
...like a couple of regular fellas.

1017
01:33:33,206 --> 01:33:35,674
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

1018
01:33:38,077 --> 01:33:40,477
Now that we've been face to face...

1019
01:33:43,416 --> 01:33:46,078
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

1020
01:33:46,419 --> 01:33:47,886
...I won't like it.

1021
01:33:48,755 --> 01:33:49,915
But, I tell you...

1022
01:33:52,492 --> 01:33:54,460
...if it's between you...

1023
01:33:54,660 --> 01:33:58,494
...and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

1024
01:33:59,432 --> 01:34:00,660
...brother...

1025
01:34:01,100 --> 01:34:02,965
...you are going down.

1026
01:34:15,515 --> 01:34:17,847
There's a flip side to that coin.

1027
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:22,349
What if you do got me boXed in...

1028
01:34:22,755 --> 01:34:24,552
...and I gotta put you down?

1029
01:34:25,691 --> 01:34:27,420
Because no matter what...

1030
01:34:27,960 --> 01:34:29,928
...you won't get in my way.

1031
01:34:31,197 --> 01:34:33,427
We've been face to face, yeah.

1032
01:34:36,736 --> 01:34:38,465
But I will not hesitate.

1033
01:34:38,805 --> 01:34:40,204
Not for a second.

1034
01:34:46,612 --> 01:34:48,079
Maybe that'll happen.

1035
01:34:50,817 --> 01:34:51,875
Or...

1036
01:34:52,218 --> 01:34:53,549
...who knows?

1037
01:34:54,153 --> 01:34:56,519
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1038
01:35:12,338 --> 01:35:13,862
They dumped us.

1039
01:35:15,141 --> 01:35:16,005
What?

1040
01:35:16,642 --> 01:35:18,109
They dumped us.

1041
01:35:18,711 --> 01:35:19,973
What do you mean?

1042
01:35:20,046 --> 01:35:21,206
Chris slipped away.

1043
01:35:21,347 --> 01:35:23,338
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1044
01:35:23,416 --> 01:35:26,817
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I just tried.

1045
01:35:27,153 --> 01:35:29,144
- What about Cheritto? - Same.

1046
01:35:29,255 --> 01:35:31,917
Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

1047
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:36,425
They dumped all our surveillance?

1048
01:35:36,496 --> 01:35:38,726
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1049
01:35:39,966 --> 01:35:43,197
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

1050
01:35:43,402 --> 01:35:48,369


1051
01:35:49,075 --> 01:35:51,509
His car's still there. He's gone.

1052
01:35:56,916 --> 01:36:01,444
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

1053
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:02,247
Hear from him?

1054
01:37:03,249 --> 01:37:07,242
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more. Where's this guy?

1055
01:37:09,889 --> 01:37:10,787
This guy...

1056
01:37:10,856 --> 01:37:12,289
...we put him on.

1057
01:37:12,458 --> 01:37:14,119
Says he knows McCauley.

1058
01:37:19,832 --> 01:37:20,764
Who are you?

1059
01:37:22,034 --> 01:37:23,262
Waingro.

1060
01:37:23,803 --> 01:37:25,464
My name's Waingro.

1061
01:37:25,805 --> 01:37:29,002
I've been living in this office. How well do you know him?

1062
01:37:30,376 --> 01:37:32,867
We took some major scores together.

1063
01:37:36,816 --> 01:37:38,716
Why haven't I heard from him?

1064
01:37:39,051 --> 01:37:40,985
He's probably busy right now.

1065
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,981
But he's real thorough.

1066
01:37:44,323 --> 01:37:46,484
He ain't going to forget about you.

1067
01:37:46,792 --> 01:37:48,191
That's reassuring.

1068
01:37:49,996 --> 01:37:52,487
I got some moves I could make here.

1069
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:55,896
Probably be a big help to you.

1070
01:38:17,356 --> 01:38:19,017
You recognize the grill man?

1071
01:38:27,033 --> 01:38:27,692
No.

1072
01:38:27,767 --> 01:38:28,597
Folsom.

1073
01:38:28,768 --> 01:38:31,168
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1074
01:38:32,772 --> 01:38:34,296
I ain't got my break yet.

1075
01:38:34,373 --> 01:38:36,568
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1076
01:38:36,809 --> 01:38:39,471
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1077
01:38:39,912 --> 01:38:41,470
Take your break later.

1078
01:38:41,981 --> 01:38:43,448
Piece of shit.

1079
01:38:43,683 --> 01:38:44,843
Pick up!

1080
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:49,644
Where the hell is he?

1081
01:38:49,789 --> 01:38:52,257
I want to check the slot for the work car.

1082
01:38:52,325 --> 01:38:53,292
So did I.

1083
01:38:58,497 --> 01:39:02,200
Hang on.

1084
01:39:04,070 --> 01:39:09,906
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

1085
01:39:22,154 --> 01:39:23,039
Where are you?

1086
01:39:23,089 --> 01:39:26,353
There's cops all over me, man, like a cheap suit.

1087
01:39:26,826 --> 01:39:28,225
I can't dump them.

1088
01:39:30,830 --> 01:39:32,491
They know you see them?

1089
01:39:32,932 --> 01:39:34,832
They're doing parallels.

1090
01:39:37,536 --> 01:39:39,094
I can try to dump them again.

1091
01:39:39,171 --> 01:39:41,366
How are we going to know if you did?

1092
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,101
You'll draw them to us.

1093
01:39:43,609 --> 01:39:45,633
Go to Ventura.Pull them out of here.

1094
01:39:46,112 --> 01:39:49,548
I'm sorry. Last thing I wanted to do was let you down.

1095
01:40:16,142 --> 01:40:16,938
Pick up.

1096
01:40:18,711 --> 01:40:21,236
Neil, man. What's up?

1097
01:40:21,380 --> 01:40:22,472
What's up?

1098
01:40:22,548 --> 01:40:24,311
What are you doing here?

1099
01:40:24,583 --> 01:40:28,110
I'm looking for a driver who can handle scanners on the radio.

1100
01:40:28,187 --> 01:40:29,518
Right now, today.

1101
01:40:29,822 --> 01:40:31,187
You remember the drill?

1102
01:40:31,257 --> 01:40:32,519
Yeah, sure.

1103
01:40:32,691 --> 01:40:33,851
You cool?

1104
01:40:34,560 --> 01:40:36,221
You know I'm cool.

1105
01:40:36,996 --> 01:40:39,430
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

1106
01:40:53,579 --> 01:40:56,711
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1107
01:40:57,850 --> 01:40:59,442
Out back in five.

1108
01:41:09,261 --> 01:41:11,229
What's burning?

1109
01:41:11,697 --> 01:41:12,925
What is this?

1110
01:41:13,699 --> 01:41:15,724
Where do you think you're going?

1111
01:42:51,263 --> 01:42:53,923
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

1112
01:42:54,066 --> 01:42:55,124
Hands up!

1113
01:42:55,200 --> 01:42:56,861


1114
01:42:58,404 --> 01:42:59,302
Get on your knees!

1115
01:42:59,371 --> 01:43:00,338
The keys!

1116
01:43:01,473 --> 01:43:02,963


1117
01:43:06,011 --> 01:43:08,639
Get over there!

1118
01:43:09,415 --> 01:43:11,012
Turn around!

1119
01:43:11,083 --> 01:43:12,778
Put your hands behind you!

1120
01:43:12,851 --> 01:43:13,818
Get down!

1121
01:43:13,886 --> 01:43:14,978
Stay down!

1122
01:43:15,988 --> 01:43:16,852


1123
01:43:19,792 --> 01:43:22,059
- Down! - The keys! The keys!

1124
01:43:27,099 --> 01:43:28,088
Stay down!

1125
01:43:28,968 --> 01:43:31,960
We want to hurt no one. We want the bank's money, not yours.

1126
01:43:32,037 --> 01:43:35,063
Your money is insured by the government. You won't lose a dime.

1127
01:43:35,140 --> 01:43:36,732
Think of your families.

1128
01:43:36,809 --> 01:43:37,693
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

1129
01:43:37,743 --> 01:43:44,099
I want you to sit on the floor, put your hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

1130
01:43:44,149 --> 01:43:46,709
...anybody got heart trouble, lean against the wall.

1131
01:43:48,087 --> 01:43:49,054
The key.

1132
01:43:49,321 --> 01:43:50,583
What key?

1133
01:43:52,524 --> 01:43:54,424
Sit down and stay down!

1134
01:43:55,628 --> 01:43:58,256
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1135
01:44:47,646 --> 01:44:49,671
Get down. Down, down, down.

1136
01:44:49,748 --> 01:44:51,215
Put your heads down!

1137
01:45:16,775 --> 01:45:19,243
You guys working a case on a Neil McCauley?

1138
01:45:19,311 --> 01:45:21,973
This C.I., Hugh Benny, called in about a bank.

1139
01:45:23,882 --> 01:45:28,581
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1140
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:48,335
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth...

1141
01:45:48,474 --> 01:45:51,534
...and I want a block northbound Flower at SiXth.

1142
01:46:29,748 --> 01:46:31,545
They're already coming out.

1143
01:46:32,117 --> 01:46:34,176
We gotta take them in the car.

1144
01:46:34,319 --> 01:46:36,150
Wait till they are all in.

1145
01:46:36,355 --> 01:46:38,789
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1146
01:46:48,200 --> 01:46:49,599
Police! Move!

1147
01:46:51,036 --> 01:46:52,435
Move. Move. Get down.

1148
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,925
Move it. Down, down.

1149
01:47:19,598 --> 01:47:20,826
We did it!

1150
01:47:25,070 --> 01:47:26,162
Move!

1151
01:47:32,411 --> 01:47:33,673
Get down!

1152
01:47:43,155 --> 01:47:44,179
Get in the car!

1153
01:48:01,273 --> 01:48:02,501
Go! Go!

1154
01:49:03,068 --> 01:49:04,057
Go!

1155
01:49:29,094 --> 01:49:29,924
Go!

1156
01:51:45,138 --> 01:51:46,469
Get down!

1157
01:51:59,820 --> 01:52:02,880
Out of the way! Get them down! Now!

1158
01:53:03,817 --> 01:53:05,148
Come here.

1159
01:53:50,663 --> 01:53:51,994
I got you.

1160
01:53:56,136 --> 01:54:00,732
Tragedy in the neighborhood today. A bank robbery spilled out into the street.

1161
01:54:01,074 --> 01:54:03,719
Claudia Newman, live on the scene. She has the latest.

1162
01:54:03,769 --> 01:54:08,303
This afternoon, a neighborhood was terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.

1163
01:54:08,481 --> 01:54:12,315
With the streets full of shoppers and kids, police and armed robbers...

1164
01:54:12,385 --> 01:54:13,295
EXcuse me, bartender.

1165
01:54:13,345 --> 01:54:17,582
Our top story tonight: Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.

1166
01:54:17,924 --> 01:54:21,087
A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken by a bank robbery...

1167
01:54:21,227 --> 01:54:23,695
...that ended in homicide and terror.

1168
01:54:23,963 --> 01:54:25,362
Michael Cheritto...

1169
01:54:25,432 --> 01:54:28,276
...one of four men involved in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.

1170
01:54:28,326 --> 01:54:32,781
Also fatally wounded: ...another suspect, Donald Breedan,

1171
01:54:32,831 --> 01:54:34,424
who died of gunshot wounds...

1172
01:54:34,474 --> 01:54:38,069
...during the extensive gunfire between police and suspects.

1173
01:54:40,180 --> 01:54:41,670
All right, hold him.

1174
01:54:41,981 --> 01:54:43,505
It's all right.

1175
01:54:51,758 --> 01:54:52,588
So?

1176
01:54:52,692 --> 01:54:54,592
He's got blood loss and shock.

1177
01:54:54,727 --> 01:54:58,527
I'll give you quarter-grain bottles of morphine for the pain.

1178
01:54:58,757 --> 01:55:00,626
Bottom line?

1179
01:55:01,100 --> 01:55:03,245
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1180
01:55:03,295 --> 01:55:06,704
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

1181
01:55:07,373 --> 01:55:08,499
SiX, seven hours.

1182
01:55:08,575 --> 01:55:10,167
- That's it? - That's it.

1183
01:55:10,543 --> 01:55:12,010
Take off your shirt.

1184
01:55:12,111 --> 01:55:12,839
What?

1185
01:55:14,647 --> 01:55:16,114
Take off your shirt.

1186
01:55:22,848 --> 01:55:26,024
My daughter gave it to me.

1187
01:55:26,092 --> 01:55:28,322
I don't give a shit. Take it off.

1188
01:55:38,830 --> 01:55:41,868
Listen to me.

1189
01:55:42,242 --> 01:55:46,235
Nate's going to pick you up. He's going to take you to his place.

1190
01:55:47,580 --> 01:55:48,390
Where's Charlene?

1191
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:53,070
We gotta go. We're on the 6 o'clock news. We gotta get out of here.

1192
01:55:53,286 --> 01:55:55,311
I'm not going without her.

1193
01:55:55,655 --> 01:55:57,020
Think about that.

1194
01:55:57,290 --> 01:55:59,121
I will meet you at Nate's.

1195
01:55:59,325 --> 01:56:00,435
Where are you going?

1196
01:56:00,485 --> 01:56:04,793
To find out if our out got spilled along with every other damn thing.

1197
01:56:05,064 --> 01:56:06,326
Who did it?

1198
01:56:07,700 --> 01:56:09,031
Who wasn't there?

1199
01:56:10,061 --> 01:56:11,537
Trejo.

1200
01:56:15,475 --> 01:56:16,840
See you at Nate's.

1201
01:56:24,142 --> 01:56:26,784
You still want me?

1202
01:56:27,020 --> 01:56:30,217
You come down here right now and you get me. Dominick and me.

1203
01:56:31,424 --> 01:56:32,584
Okay, baby.

1204
01:56:32,992 --> 01:56:34,983
I'll be there in two hours.

1205
01:56:36,296 --> 01:56:37,388
All right.

1206
01:56:39,365 --> 01:56:40,798
Goddamn you, Chris.

1207
01:56:41,301 --> 01:56:42,461
Goddamn you.

1208
01:56:43,436 --> 01:56:45,666
You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

1209
01:56:45,872 --> 01:56:46,861
Right.

1210
01:57:35,288 --> 01:57:37,415
Why did you do it? What happened?

1211
01:57:38,791 --> 01:57:40,349
- They made me. - Who?

1212
01:57:40,493 --> 01:57:41,482
Where's Anna?

1213
01:57:43,129 --> 01:57:44,255
She's dead.

1214
01:57:47,200 --> 01:57:50,328
So is Michael and Breedan, the guy who stood in for you.

1215
01:57:50,837 --> 01:57:51,997
Who did it?

1216
01:57:52,138 --> 01:57:53,105
Who did it?

1217
01:57:53,172 --> 01:57:54,901
They had Anna, man.

1218
01:57:55,108 --> 01:57:55,972
Who?

1219
01:57:57,543 --> 01:57:58,510
Waingro.

1220
01:57:59,479 --> 01:58:00,707
Waingro.

1221
01:58:01,481 --> 01:58:02,641
On his own?

1222
01:58:04,617 --> 01:58:06,278
- For someone. - Who?

1223
01:58:07,654 --> 01:58:09,451
The other he worked for.

1224
01:58:11,124 --> 01:58:12,386
Van Zant.

1225
01:58:15,361 --> 01:58:16,385
Van Zant?

1226
01:58:20,933 --> 01:58:22,161
Are you sure?

1227
01:58:22,702 --> 01:58:23,964
Van Zant.

1228
01:58:25,738 --> 01:58:28,104
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

1229
01:58:29,208 --> 01:58:30,675
I don't think so.

1230
01:58:31,477 --> 01:58:32,444
Come on.

1231
01:58:34,414 --> 01:58:36,006
I don't remember.

1232
01:58:41,387 --> 01:58:42,547
I'll call a medic.

1233
01:58:42,622 --> 01:58:44,522
I'm not going to make it.

1234
01:58:46,759 --> 01:58:48,886
I can't feel a bloody thing.

1235
01:58:51,097 --> 01:58:52,621
My Anna's gone.

1236
01:58:55,201 --> 01:58:56,566
She's gone.

1237
01:58:58,838 --> 01:59:00,829
Don't leave me like this.

1238
01:59:01,066 --> 01:59:03,296
Please, homes.

1239
01:59:04,477 --> 01:59:06,468
Don't leave me like this.

1240
01:59:33,372 --> 01:59:35,897
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1241
01:59:36,776 --> 01:59:38,073
It's a new one.

1242
01:59:39,512 --> 01:59:41,980
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1243
01:59:42,315 --> 01:59:43,475
10725.

1244
01:59:44,050 --> 01:59:45,210
10725.

1245
01:59:45,376 --> 01:59:46,852
Chris?

1246
01:59:47,353 --> 01:59:49,116
He's with me, my place.

1247
01:59:49,388 --> 01:59:51,151
NeXt, Waingro, okay?

1248
01:59:53,593 --> 01:59:54,924
You got the time?

1249
01:59:55,862 --> 01:59:57,295
I'll make time.

1250
01:59:57,630 --> 01:59:59,097
And I need a new out.

1251
02:00:00,099 --> 02:00:01,259
Is it blown?

1252
02:00:03,002 --> 02:00:04,663
How can I trust it?

1253
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:08,934
You got it.

1254
02:00:09,942 --> 02:00:11,409
Stay healthy.

1255
02:00:16,916 --> 02:00:18,577
Charlene Shiherlis.

1256
02:00:19,485 --> 02:00:22,454
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice to stash her in.

1257
02:00:22,522 --> 02:00:23,955
Neil's transportation.

1258
02:00:24,123 --> 02:00:28,082
Get on the phone. Somewhere, someone's trying to put it together for him.

1259
02:00:28,461 --> 02:00:30,861
You don't believe he already had a plan?

1260
02:00:30,963 --> 02:00:32,590
Sure. Now he needs another.

1261
02:00:32,665 --> 02:00:35,190
Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1262
02:00:36,469 --> 02:00:38,960
This rat motherfucker, where did we get him?

1263
02:00:39,038 --> 02:00:42,599
He's a C.I. For a burglary cop. Called in the tip on the bank.

1264
02:00:42,775 --> 02:00:44,402
On Neil McCauley.

1265
02:00:44,577 --> 02:00:46,044
How much time we got?

1266
02:00:46,512 --> 02:00:51,176
Eight, ten hours for him to set up a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1267
02:01:44,837 --> 02:01:47,635
You ratted McCauley to us! How'd you know?

1268
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:49,171
Who told you?

1269
02:01:49,542 --> 02:01:51,840
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1270
02:01:52,211 --> 02:01:53,269
Who?

1271
02:02:37,924 --> 02:02:39,414
Waingro, where is he?

1272
02:02:40,626 --> 02:02:41,490
Where?

1273
02:02:41,560 --> 02:02:42,925
How would I know?

1274
02:03:08,721 --> 02:03:11,779
Well......what do we have here?

1275
02:03:13,025 --> 02:03:14,253
This pretty?

1276
02:03:14,327 --> 02:03:15,453
This pretty?

1277
02:03:17,622 --> 02:03:20,283
You piece of shit.

1278
02:03:20,333 --> 02:03:23,461
Told me you wanted out from under. You're scared, right?

1279
02:03:23,736 --> 02:03:25,567
You want out? This is out.

1280
02:03:25,638 --> 02:03:26,614
- Yeah, what's your end?

1281
02:03:26,664 --> 02:03:28,325
- I don't need no stupid broad.

1282
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:30,875
How'd I get into this?

1283
02:03:30,977 --> 02:03:31,875
Easy.

1284
02:03:32,745 --> 02:03:35,145
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1285
02:03:35,481 --> 02:03:38,641
FiX her a drink.Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1286
02:03:38,684 --> 02:03:39,742
Fuck her.

1287
02:03:42,154 --> 02:03:44,816
You better get in there and stay in there.

1288
02:03:47,819 --> 02:03:49,760
Lookie here.

1289
02:03:51,263 --> 02:03:53,527
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

1290
02:03:53,599 --> 02:03:55,624
You want to put Dominick in the bedroom?

1291
02:03:55,835 --> 02:03:57,268
He stays with me.

1292
02:04:07,913 --> 02:04:09,312
So, what now?

1293
02:04:12,118 --> 02:04:13,244
He's right.

1294
02:04:13,319 --> 02:04:15,378
You want out? This is out.

1295
02:04:17,223 --> 02:04:19,487
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1296
02:04:19,558 --> 02:04:20,786
No shit.

1297
02:04:21,360 --> 02:04:23,760
That's right. You would have to.

1298
02:04:24,363 --> 02:04:27,799
See, if you don't betray Chris, you victimize Dominick.

1299
02:04:29,168 --> 02:04:31,546
'Cause he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...

1300
02:04:31,596 --> 02:04:37,539
...'cause you got no parents to take him. So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1301
02:04:37,610 --> 02:04:39,510
...juvenile facilities.

1302
02:04:39,745 --> 02:04:41,508
Then he steals a car.

1303
02:04:42,214 --> 02:04:46,344
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.

1304
02:04:47,720 --> 02:04:49,312
Fucked for life.

1305
02:04:51,190 --> 02:04:53,920
You know what happens, because you've been there.

1306
02:04:55,494 --> 02:04:59,658
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life. But Chris did.

1307
02:05:01,801 --> 02:05:04,531
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1308
02:05:05,504 --> 02:05:06,903
You can do it...

1309
02:05:07,239 --> 02:05:09,503
...for your kid, so you can raise him.

1310
02:05:13,512 --> 02:05:14,911
What else are you selling?

1311
02:05:14,980 --> 02:05:16,379
All kinds of shit.

1312
02:05:17,850 --> 02:05:22,685
But I don't have to sell this, you know it. This kind of shit here sells itself.

1313
02:05:29,428 --> 02:05:30,759
Here's an update.

1314
02:05:30,896 --> 02:05:32,659
Drucker's on Line 2.

1315
02:05:33,032 --> 02:05:34,590
Hold on for a second.

1316
02:05:36,936 --> 02:05:38,597
Drucker's on the other line.

1317
02:05:39,197 --> 02:05:40,831
Conference him in.

1318
02:05:42,174 --> 02:05:43,072
Go ahead.

1319
02:05:43,609 --> 02:05:45,236
Vincent, it's me.

1320
02:05:47,913 --> 02:05:50,074
One answer. What's it going to be?

1321
02:05:57,056 --> 02:05:59,616
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1322
02:05:59,692 --> 02:06:02,160
That's good. Here's the deal.

1323
02:06:03,195 --> 02:06:06,028
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life...

1324
02:06:06,465 --> 02:06:08,956
...and become a born-again good citizen.

1325
02:06:09,235 --> 02:06:13,228
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.

1326
02:06:13,873 --> 02:06:18,537
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew, then went to work for a money launderer.

1327
02:06:18,811 --> 02:06:20,073
Van Zant.

1328
02:06:20,304 --> 02:06:23,639
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak...

1329
02:06:23,716 --> 02:06:25,660
...because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1330
02:06:25,710 --> 02:06:29,884
If Neil goes after anybody else, it's going to be Waingro.

1331
02:06:30,089 --> 02:06:33,650
Waingro just got himself a suite at the Airport Marquis...

1332
02:06:33,726 --> 02:06:35,660
...under the name Jamieson.

1333
02:06:35,895 --> 02:06:40,059
He's there now. I want you to get that to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1334
02:06:40,366 --> 02:06:43,358
...assignment officers and snitches in County.

1335
02:06:43,836 --> 02:06:47,829
Anyone you can think of who'll put it on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

1336
02:06:47,907 --> 02:06:50,569
...and personally check their coms every 30 minutes.

1337
02:06:50,643 --> 02:06:52,887
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1338
02:06:52,937 --> 02:06:54,910
How're you feeling?

1339
02:06:55,414 --> 02:06:56,972
Hang up, but I'll live.

1340
02:07:06,158 --> 02:07:07,386
He's here.

1341
02:07:08,260 --> 02:07:09,921
Neil is still here.

1342
02:07:11,096 --> 02:07:12,586
I can feel it.

1343
02:07:13,432 --> 02:07:14,899
For how long?

1344
02:07:16,402 --> 02:07:18,370
Seven, eight hours, maX.

1345
02:07:27,746 --> 02:07:29,077
What did you do?

1346
02:07:29,481 --> 02:07:30,448
That was you?

1347
02:07:31,016 --> 02:07:32,745
I don't sell metal.

1348
02:07:33,619 --> 02:07:36,611
Would have been okay, you fly out after. Now it's jammed.

1349
02:07:36,789 --> 02:07:37,999
We gotta go together.

1350
02:07:38,049 --> 02:07:40,917
Those other people were with you?

1351
02:07:42,728 --> 02:07:44,320
My friend, Michael...

1352
02:07:46,031 --> 02:07:47,555
...he knew the risks.

1353
02:07:52,504 --> 02:07:54,563
When it rains, you get wet.

1354
02:07:57,343 --> 02:07:58,605
Get packed.

1355
02:08:17,997 --> 02:08:19,692
Why did you do this to me?

1356
02:08:31,877 --> 02:08:33,276
Lt'll be all right.

1357
02:08:33,345 --> 02:08:34,937
Do you understand?

1358
02:08:39,918 --> 02:08:41,715
It's going to be all right.

1359
02:08:53,165 --> 02:08:56,328
There's a Camaro at this address, Level D, Slot 18.

1360
02:09:01,573 --> 02:09:03,040
Here's some cash.

1361
02:09:06,045 --> 02:09:07,342
When is it over?

1362
02:09:10,749 --> 02:09:12,444
Twenty-two hours from now.

1363
02:09:12,785 --> 02:09:16,536
- Then we get out of here clean. - When will you let me leave?

1364
02:09:20,392 --> 02:09:21,450
Go now.

1365
02:09:21,527 --> 02:09:23,518
You want out? There's the door.

1366
02:09:24,096 --> 02:09:26,087
Will you let me leave later?

1367
02:09:31,236 --> 02:09:32,794
It will be different.

1368
02:09:34,440 --> 02:09:36,203
Do you even understand?

1369
02:10:07,139 --> 02:10:08,504
It's ready.

1370
02:10:16,215 --> 02:10:18,046
This is my friend Ralph.

1371
02:10:18,650 --> 02:10:20,641
You didn't tell me you were...

1372
02:10:21,487 --> 02:10:22,852
Oh, my God!

1373
02:10:23,021 --> 02:10:24,283
Where's Lauren?

1374
02:10:24,623 --> 02:10:26,333
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1375
02:10:26,383 --> 02:10:28,977
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

1376
02:10:29,027 --> 02:10:30,255
What are you sorry about?

1377
02:10:30,329 --> 02:10:31,489
Sit down.

1378
02:10:32,131 --> 02:10:33,530
Don't you even get angry?

1379
02:10:34,733 --> 02:10:35,825
I'm angry.

1380
02:10:37,569 --> 02:10:39,434
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1381
02:10:40,005 --> 02:10:42,803
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1382
02:10:44,643 --> 02:10:47,339
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1383
02:10:49,148 --> 02:10:51,013
In her eX-husband's...

1384
02:10:51,517 --> 02:10:54,577
...dead-tech, post-modernistic, bullshit house...

1385
02:10:54,653 --> 02:10:56,052
...if you want to.

1386
02:10:58,424 --> 02:11:00,654
But you do not get to watch...

1387
02:11:01,360 --> 02:11:02,918
...my fucking...

1388
02:11:02,920 --> 02:11:04,690
...television set!

1389
02:11:04,763 --> 02:11:06,128
For God's sake.

1390
02:11:12,971 --> 02:11:14,802
Put the television set down.

1391
02:11:14,907 --> 02:11:15,850
- I never cheated on you, bitch.

1392
02:11:15,900 --> 02:11:17,231
- Maybe you should have.

1393
02:11:17,609 --> 02:11:19,053
- I should have? - You're a party to this.

1394
02:11:19,103 --> 02:11:23,076
I made Ralph fuck you because it makes me feel good.

1395
02:11:23,148 --> 02:11:24,809
Our situation is absurd.

1396
02:11:27,386 --> 02:11:29,411
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1397
02:11:33,091 --> 02:11:36,993
Why is it that I have to figure things out and eXplain them to you?

1398
02:11:37,162 --> 02:11:39,494
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1399
02:11:40,032 --> 02:11:41,124
How admirable.

1400
02:11:41,200 --> 02:11:43,498
- You bet. - EXcept none of it's about us.

1401
02:11:44,136 --> 02:11:45,103
No.

1402
02:11:46,572 --> 02:11:49,405
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1403
02:11:50,375 --> 02:11:52,502
...you walk through our life dead.

1404
02:11:53,212 --> 02:11:57,308
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1405
02:12:10,329 --> 02:12:12,729
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1406
02:12:13,232 --> 02:12:14,494
The plane...

1407
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:17,926
...charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1408
02:12:18,203 --> 02:12:20,103
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1409
02:12:23,375 --> 02:12:24,569
Touches down...

1410
02:12:24,643 --> 02:12:27,203
...holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1411
02:12:27,446 --> 02:12:30,973
The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed a flight plan, the works.

1412
02:12:32,518 --> 02:12:33,610
Where's Chris?

1413
02:12:34,186 --> 02:12:35,244
He's gone.

1414
02:12:36,655 --> 02:12:37,622
What?

1415
02:12:38,357 --> 02:12:40,757
Said he's going on his own. Went to find Charlene.

1416
02:12:40,826 --> 02:12:43,124
- Did you bring him here? - Yeah, I did.

1417
02:12:44,096 --> 02:12:45,154
What happened?

1418
02:12:46,265 --> 02:12:47,823
It's a free country.

1419
02:12:53,071 --> 02:12:54,902
Check in with me at 9:00...

1420
02:12:55,274 --> 02:12:57,071
...everything is still cool.

1421
02:12:58,777 --> 02:12:59,937
All right.

1422
02:13:23,302 --> 02:13:25,634
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1423
02:13:28,907 --> 02:13:30,704
I know life is short.

1424
02:13:31,343 --> 02:13:33,436
Whatever time you get is luck.

1425
02:13:36,148 --> 02:13:37,706
You want to walk?

1426
02:13:40,552 --> 02:13:42,349
You walk right now...

1427
02:13:43,956 --> 02:13:45,548
...all on your own.

1428
02:13:46,224 --> 02:13:48,886
On your own you choose to come with me.

1429
02:13:55,300 --> 02:13:56,892
All I know is...

1430
02:13:59,171 --> 02:14:02,436
...there's no point in me going anywhere anymore...

1431
02:14:04,009 --> 02:14:06,000
...if it's going to be alone...

1432
02:14:07,045 --> 02:14:08,569
...without you.

1433
02:15:07,698 --> 02:15:09,665
I got a live one.

1434
02:15:09,967 --> 02:15:11,802
I'll hold.

1435
02:15:14,513 --> 02:15:15,980
Show yourself.

1436
02:15:17,082 --> 02:15:18,674
- Do it. - Shut up!

1437
02:15:23,021 --> 02:15:25,251
Now, just one second at the window...

1438
02:15:26,491 --> 02:15:28,288
...and it's all over.

1439
02:17:18,270 --> 02:17:19,362
Hey, man...

1440
02:17:20,831 --> 02:17:24,302
...you know any place to rent around here?

1441
02:17:25,869 --> 02:17:29,896


1442
02:17:42,227 --> 02:17:43,251
It's not him.

1443
02:17:43,328 --> 02:17:44,693
It's not Chris.

1444
02:17:52,838 --> 02:17:54,533
Unit 2, this is Command.

1445
02:17:55,006 --> 02:17:57,337
Take him at the street.Check him out.

1446
02:18:25,303 --> 02:18:26,770
He's John Peterson.

1447
02:18:26,838 --> 02:18:29,238
Valid ID. Car's registered to...

1448
02:18:29,407 --> 02:18:31,360
...Bukowski, Gene.

1449
02:18:31,710 --> 02:18:32,870
Ran it to DMV.

1450
02:18:32,944 --> 02:18:34,241
It's clean.

1451
02:18:37,215 --> 02:18:38,307
Let him go.

1452
02:18:38,884 --> 02:18:39,976
Roger.

1453
02:18:40,252 --> 02:18:42,243
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1454
02:18:44,222 --> 02:18:45,086
It's no-go.

1455
02:18:55,467 --> 02:18:58,300
Would you like a cup of coffee while we wait?

1456
02:18:58,403 --> 02:19:00,132
Yeah, that would be nice.

1457
02:19:31,269 --> 02:19:32,634
What do you got?

1458
02:19:32,704 --> 02:19:34,171
Nothing's happening.

1459
02:19:47,385 --> 02:19:48,852
Hello, it's Vincent.

1460
02:19:49,487 --> 02:19:50,579
What do you got?

1461
02:19:50,655 --> 02:19:52,885
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1462
02:19:53,458 --> 02:19:54,550
That's it.

1463
02:20:03,335 --> 02:20:04,666
You know what?

1464
02:20:07,205 --> 02:20:08,672
Neil is gone.

1465
02:20:13,745 --> 02:20:15,337
Flying like a bird.

1466
02:20:15,880 --> 02:20:17,211
How do you know?

1467
02:20:19,317 --> 02:20:20,249
We still got bait!

1468
02:20:20,318 --> 02:20:20,894
- Maybe some time! - What do we got?

1469
02:20:20,944 --> 02:20:23,918
What do we got?

1470
02:20:24,823 --> 02:20:26,814
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1471
02:20:28,259 --> 02:20:29,726
You were good.

1472
02:20:31,563 --> 02:20:33,224
I'm going to the hotel.

1473
02:20:34,499 --> 02:20:36,490
I'm going to take a shower...

1474
02:20:37,469 --> 02:20:39,903
...and I'm going to sleep for a month.

1475
02:22:49,192 --> 02:22:52,294
Here.

1476
02:22:59,377 --> 02:23:00,344
Come on.

1477
02:23:09,087 --> 02:23:10,179
Shit.

1478
02:23:19,430 --> 02:23:21,193
Motherfucking waste.

1479
02:23:24,636 --> 02:23:27,469
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1480
02:23:27,539 --> 02:23:28,801
Not you, baby.

1481
02:23:28,907 --> 02:23:30,135
Not you.

1482
02:23:35,446 --> 02:23:38,176
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1483
02:23:38,349 --> 02:23:41,182
Lauren Gustafson, and she's supposed to be here.

1484
02:23:48,018 --> 02:23:50,819
I need somebody to help...

1485
02:23:54,157 --> 02:23:58,026
I got you.

1486
02:23:58,361 --> 02:24:02,498
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

1487
02:24:03,007 --> 02:24:04,565
Let's get a doctor!

1488
02:24:04,642 --> 02:24:06,405
Let's go! A doctor here!

1489
02:24:06,711 --> 02:24:08,588
- There's your mama. - Let's just calm down.

1490
02:24:08,638 --> 02:24:11,341
- Is she on any drugs? - I'm calm. No.

1491
02:24:13,476 --> 02:24:16,536
Get a trauma surgeon and a vascular surgeon.

1492
02:24:16,754 --> 02:24:20,246
I think she cut both arteries. I could hardly feel her pulse.

1493
02:24:20,592 --> 02:24:21,957
Her pressure's down.

1494
02:24:22,026 --> 02:24:23,891
So is the respiration. You have to intubate her.

1495
02:24:23,962 --> 02:24:25,224
It's ready.

1496
02:24:27,098 --> 02:24:29,123
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1497
02:24:29,234 --> 02:24:29,876
I don't know.

1498
02:24:29,926 --> 02:24:31,834
Where did you find her?

1499
02:24:31,903 --> 02:24:33,063
The bathtub.

1500
02:24:33,496 --> 02:24:37,159
Give her large-bore normal saline.

1501
02:24:37,408 --> 02:24:38,875
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1502
02:24:38,943 --> 02:24:42,310
Give me two units, O-negative. Let's type and cross her for siX.

1503
02:24:44,282 --> 02:24:47,683
Where is respiratory? We need more help. Get them down now.

1504
02:24:47,719 --> 02:24:50,745
Let's have X-ray ready for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1505
02:24:57,262 --> 02:25:00,288
Your daughter's out of surgery and she's in the recovery room.

1506
02:25:00,365 --> 02:25:01,889
Her vital signs are stable.

1507
02:25:01,966 --> 02:25:04,628
The surgeon will speak to you in a few moments.

1508
02:25:04,736 --> 02:25:05,703
She's okay?

1509
02:25:05,803 --> 02:25:06,929
She's doing good.

1510
02:25:07,005 --> 02:25:08,596
She'll be okay.

1511
02:25:09,007 --> 02:25:10,907
She's going to be okay.

1512
02:25:11,109 --> 02:25:14,010
Oh, my baby. Why did she do this to herself?

1513
02:25:15,446 --> 02:25:18,540
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

1514
02:25:22,920 --> 02:25:25,616
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1515
02:25:26,024 --> 02:25:28,151
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1516
02:25:28,226 --> 02:25:31,024
Do you understand? I ain't going anywhere.

1517
02:25:45,943 --> 02:25:46,910
It's me.

1518
02:25:47,545 --> 02:25:50,309
Plane's in the air now. You're right on time.

1519
02:25:50,915 --> 02:25:54,849
I still can't find a driver...so that's in the trust.

1520
02:25:55,053 --> 02:25:56,452
One other thing...

1521
02:25:57,455 --> 02:25:59,013
...I gotta tell you.

1522
02:25:59,791 --> 02:26:03,818
The guy you want is in the Marquis under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1523
02:26:04,195 --> 02:26:05,992
...which I figure you wouldn't.

1524
02:26:06,230 --> 02:26:07,629
You figured right.

1525
02:26:08,066 --> 02:26:09,658
So, so long, brother.

1526
02:26:11,869 --> 02:26:13,336
You take it easy.

1527
02:26:14,038 --> 02:26:15,369
You're home free.

1528
02:26:17,408 --> 02:26:18,670
Take it easy.

1529
02:26:29,687 --> 02:26:30,779
What is it?

1530
02:26:31,089 --> 02:26:32,283
Nothing.

1531
02:26:32,590 --> 02:26:33,852
Home free.

1532
02:27:11,996 --> 02:27:13,930
I gotta take care of something.

1533
02:27:14,031 --> 02:27:15,191
Is there time?

1534
02:27:16,000 --> 02:27:17,228
There's time.

1535
02:27:46,130 --> 02:27:48,792
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1536
02:28:31,042 --> 02:28:31,872
Registration.

1537
02:28:31,943 --> 02:28:33,205
This is room service.

1538
02:28:33,277 --> 02:28:37,236
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they screwed up his room number. What is it?

1539
02:28:37,315 --> 02:28:39,146
- They're always doing that. - I know.

1540
02:28:39,217 --> 02:28:40,479
1735.

1541
02:28:40,751 --> 02:28:42,013
Thank you.

1542
02:30:25,823 --> 02:30:27,552
Your attention, please.

1543
02:30:27,625 --> 02:30:29,991
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

1544
02:30:31,262 --> 02:30:32,729
Do not panic.

1545
02:30:32,930 --> 02:30:34,761
Do not take the elevators.

1546
02:30:40,037 --> 02:30:41,163
I'm staying here.

1547
02:30:41,238 --> 02:30:44,605
I'll check the stairs. If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1548
02:30:49,246 --> 02:30:51,612
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1549
02:30:52,650 --> 02:30:54,880
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1550
02:30:56,921 --> 02:30:58,582
And she chose you.

1551
02:31:01,192 --> 02:31:03,023
She picked your place.

1552
02:31:05,196 --> 02:31:07,187
It's not right, what happened to her.

1553
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:08,458
No, it's not.

1554
02:31:25,116 --> 02:31:26,879
Is there any way that...

1555
02:31:29,220 --> 02:31:31,279
...it could work out between us?

1556
02:31:34,091 --> 02:31:36,491
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1557
02:31:36,827 --> 02:31:37,885
But...

1558
02:31:38,062 --> 02:31:39,654
...in the end...

1559
02:31:44,568 --> 02:31:46,297
It's like you said:

1560
02:31:49,440 --> 02:31:50,805
All I am...

1561
02:31:51,509 --> 02:31:53,602
...is what I'm going after.

1562
02:32:00,985 --> 02:32:03,215
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1563
02:32:14,298 --> 02:32:15,856
Go on, if you have to.

1564
02:32:19,036 --> 02:32:20,196
I'll stay.

1565
02:32:20,271 --> 02:32:22,171
I'm okay. I can handle this.

1566
02:32:25,376 --> 02:32:26,843
Just be careful.

1567
02:32:27,611 --> 02:32:30,273
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1568
02:32:31,382 --> 02:32:32,349
Okay?

1569
02:33:33,177 --> 02:33:35,042
Security. There's a fire on three.

1570
02:33:35,513 --> 02:33:37,310
We have to evacuate all floors.

1571
02:33:37,381 --> 02:33:38,848
I can't leave here.

1572
02:33:47,892 --> 02:33:50,952
Why don't we just talk about this a bit, brother?

1573
02:34:05,209 --> 02:34:06,540
He's here on 17.

1574
02:34:09,513 --> 02:34:10,741
Look at me.

1575
02:34:10,881 --> 02:34:11,973
Look at me!

1576
02:34:15,286 --> 02:34:16,378
Look at me!

1577
02:34:48,319 --> 02:34:49,786
LAPD! Don't move!

1578
02:34:49,854 --> 02:34:51,685
Put your hands on your head!

1579
02:35:27,191 --> 02:35:28,886
Switch me to TAC 5.

1580
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:30,922
Casals...

1581
02:35:31,228 --> 02:35:32,160
JJ...

1582
02:35:32,997 --> 02:35:34,259
Drucker, JJ...

1583
02:35:34,431 --> 02:35:36,831
I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.

1584
02:35:36,901 --> 02:35:38,027
What have you got?

1585
02:35:38,135 --> 02:35:41,298
Teams are moving up the other elevators to the 17th-floor elevators.

1586
02:35:41,338 --> 02:35:44,774
All out of commission because of the fire alarm. People everywhere.

1587
02:35:44,875 --> 02:35:46,274
Fine. 10-4.

1588
02:38:11,255 --> 02:38:12,813
Let me have that shot.

1589
02:44:30,967 --> 02:44:33,128
Told you I'm never going back.

1590
02:44:37,240 --> 02:44:38,332
Yeah.
