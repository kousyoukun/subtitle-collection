1
00:03:36,985 --> 00:03:38,748
Check, charge or cash?

2
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,012
Cash.

3
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,648
Make it out to...

4
00:03:43,792 --> 00:03:45,692
...Jack's Demolition. Tucson.

5
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,188
$788.30.

6
00:05:38,273 --> 00:05:40,036
Taking me to breakfast?

7
00:05:40,242 --> 00:05:41,903
I can't. I'm meeting Bosko.

8
00:05:43,478 --> 00:05:44,740
Hey, Vincent.

9
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,445
Where are my barrettes?

10
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,649
I saw them on the kitchen table.

11
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:50,181
I already checked.

12
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:51,719
Coffee?

13
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,112
No school today?

14
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:56,385
My dad's taking me to the new building
and then to lunch.

15
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:58,083
Try under the sofa cushions.

16
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:04,023
He's already a half an hour late.

17
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:07,796
He's going to show,
or stand her up like last time?

18
00:06:08,303 --> 00:06:09,497
I'll make coffee.

19
00:06:09,571 --> 00:06:10,731
Out of time.

20
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:26,212
Mom, my barrettes are not on the couch.

21
00:06:27,289 --> 00:06:29,018
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,121
I don't want to wear the blue ones.
They don't match.

23
00:06:32,194 --> 00:06:35,027
- Did you check in your bathroom?
- I checked everywhere!

24
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:36,529
What do you want me to do?

25
00:06:36,598 --> 00:06:37,758
Find them!

26
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:40,834
- Mom, pay attention!
- All right, sweetie, all right!

27
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:42,766
Daddy's going to be here.

28
00:06:42,837 --> 00:06:44,031
I won't be ready!

29
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:45,732
- I'll be late.
- No, you won't.

30
00:06:45,807 --> 00:06:47,331
I will be late!

31
00:06:47,876 --> 00:06:50,674
Before Daddy comes,
we can find them if we look together.

32
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:53,373
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

33
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:57,584
We'll find them together, you and me.
We'll find them.

34
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:01,554
Just relaX. He won't come
before we find them. I promise you.

35
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,628
Give me another refill.

36
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:27,648
What's your name?

37
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:28,977
Waingro.

38
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,123
You're Michael?

39
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,370
You guys always work together?

40
00:07:55,043 --> 00:07:56,510
All the time.

41
00:07:56,845 --> 00:07:58,244
Real tight crew?

42
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,506
Real tight.

43
00:08:00,582 --> 00:08:04,040
If this works good,
I'd consider going again, you know.

44
00:08:04,452 --> 00:08:06,852
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

45
00:08:17,499 --> 00:08:18,796
How's he doing?

46
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,298
Hundred percent.

47
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,636
Right on schedule.

48
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:25,172
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

49
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:28,873
We're a mile and a half from you.

50
00:08:28,943 --> 00:08:30,035
Okay.

51
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:55,727
Just crossed over the number one lane,
300 yards from you.

52
00:08:56,438 --> 00:08:57,370
Get set.

53
00:08:57,605 --> 00:08:58,697
I am.

54
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:09,475
Here we go.

55
00:10:09,844 --> 00:10:10,902
211!

56
00:10:11,379 --> 00:10:12,846
We're being held up!

57
00:10:18,653 --> 00:10:21,713
- 211 alarm. Armored car.
- There's the call.

58
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:23,215
Three minutes.

59
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:25,725
Clear!

60
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,721
Eighty seconds left!

61
00:11:33,094 --> 00:11:34,857
Get back! Get back!

62
00:11:36,197 --> 00:11:37,255
Get back!

63
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,496
Slick, see that shit coming out of
their ears? They can't fucking hear you!

64
00:11:43,638 --> 00:11:44,605
Cool it!

65
00:11:56,985 --> 00:11:58,145
I got it.

66
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,587
Got it.

67
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,859
You had to fuck with me.

68
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:06,955
Want to fuck with me?

69
00:12:32,253 --> 00:12:34,118
What are you doing? What did he do?

70
00:12:34,188 --> 00:12:35,655
He was making a move.

71
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,598
Dumb motherfucker.

72
00:13:41,923 --> 00:13:43,481
A million siX...

73
00:13:44,425 --> 00:13:47,087
Forty cents on the dollar, $640,000 to you.

74
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:49,195
Here's $150,000 front money.

75
00:13:50,098 --> 00:13:52,191
Get you the rest in two, three days.

76
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:54,926
Who owned these?

77
00:13:58,873 --> 00:14:00,864
"Malibu Equity and Investments."

78
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,042
Roger Van Zant.

79
00:14:03,111 --> 00:14:04,942
Owns banks in the Caymans...

80
00:14:05,046 --> 00:14:08,982
...runs investment portfolios
for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

81
00:14:09,283 --> 00:14:10,250
So?

82
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,385
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

83
00:14:12,453 --> 00:14:13,647
He's insured.

84
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:17,658
That's the point. He collects
100 percent from the insurance.

85
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:20,455
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds
back from us...

86
00:14:20,561 --> 00:14:24,622
...for 60 percent of their value. Makes
40 percent on top of the 100 percent.

87
00:14:26,534 --> 00:14:29,697
Sell it back to him,
that's an eXtra $320,000 to you.

88
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:31,596
Try it on.

89
00:14:32,707 --> 00:14:33,696
Kelso called.

90
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:34,900
About what?

91
00:14:35,143 --> 00:14:37,976
A score he's putting out,
he wants you to look at.

92
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,472
I don't need his score. I got my own.

93
00:14:40,648 --> 00:14:42,946
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

94
00:14:43,451 --> 00:14:44,748
9:00 a.m. Tomorrow.

95
00:14:44,819 --> 00:14:46,150
What happened?

96
00:14:47,555 --> 00:14:48,817
Don't ask.

97
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:25,250
Find the ambulance?

98
00:15:25,326 --> 00:15:28,557
- Dumped it four blocks from here.
- 22nd Street.

99
00:15:29,464 --> 00:15:32,490
They torched it.
Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

100
00:15:35,036 --> 00:15:39,200
They were airborne. They taped the last
few seconds of the black-and-whites.

101
00:15:41,609 --> 00:15:43,543
Stolen from Fresno two weeks ago.

102
00:15:43,811 --> 00:15:46,871
Yellow pickup truck out of Whittier
a day before yesterday.

103
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:48,412
You taking this one?

104
00:15:49,217 --> 00:15:51,117
Or does it stay in Division?

105
00:15:52,286 --> 00:15:55,744
Does this look like gangbangers
working the local 7-11 to you?

106
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,790
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

107
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,925
We got three motorists.

108
00:15:59,994 --> 00:16:02,462
All they saw were men with masks.
They were distant.

109
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:05,123
TV man over there, however,
he was closer.

110
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,167
Did he ID anybody?

111
00:16:08,236 --> 00:16:10,704
He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

112
00:16:13,074 --> 00:16:14,666
What about them?

113
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:18,674
According to TV man,
this guy started mouthing off.

114
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:19,874
Smart.

115
00:16:20,014 --> 00:16:22,141
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

116
00:16:23,084 --> 00:16:24,813
Now, I figure this guy...

117
00:16:25,153 --> 00:16:28,213
...went for that hold-out piece,
ankle holster.

118
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,149
From here...

119
00:16:30,525 --> 00:16:31,719
...bang, bang...

120
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:33,260
...bang, bang, bang.

121
00:16:33,661 --> 00:16:34,753
This side.

122
00:16:35,029 --> 00:16:39,090
This guy has got what appears to be
a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

123
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:43,101
Tattooing around the head wound,
scorched bones, close range.

124
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:44,570
Probably eXecuted.

125
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:49,135
It was a million siX in bearer bonds.

126
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:51,040
They ignored the loose cash.

127
00:16:51,112 --> 00:16:53,945
'Cause they had no time.
They were on a clock.

128
00:16:54,115 --> 00:16:56,879
Which means they knew
our response time to a 211...

129
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:59,613
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

130
00:17:00,454 --> 00:17:02,615
...escaped in under three minutes.

131
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,554
It's a good spot here.
We got good escape routes.

132
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:06,955
Two freeways...

133
00:17:07,128 --> 00:17:08,595
...within a quarter of a mile.

134
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:09,958
Traffic video camera?

135
00:17:10,364 --> 00:17:12,423
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

136
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,058
You recognize the M. O?

137
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:15,329
M. O...

138
00:17:15,636 --> 00:17:17,228
...is that they're good.

139
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:21,570
Once it escalated into a murder-one
beef for all, after they killed two guards...

140
00:17:21,642 --> 00:17:23,007
...they didn't hesitate.

141
00:17:23,077 --> 00:17:27,013
Popped guard number three because...
what difference does it make?

142
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:29,142
Why leave a living witness?

143
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:32,318
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock-and-roll.

144
00:17:35,323 --> 00:17:36,950
The shape charge.

145
00:17:37,358 --> 00:17:41,021
The shape charge indicates
that they are technically proficient.

146
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:43,154
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

147
00:17:43,531 --> 00:17:46,898
Let's look for recent high-line burglaries
that mystify us.

148
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:50,532
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.
You're gonna get the phone book.

149
00:17:50,605 --> 00:17:53,506
Do it anyway.
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

150
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:58,471
Check the usual fences. You and I will
check Cuzomano and Torena.

151
00:17:58,579 --> 00:18:00,979
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

152
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:02,548
Hang in with Forensics.

153
00:18:02,717 --> 00:18:05,379
From the bomb squad,
I want the eXplosive.

154
00:18:05,586 --> 00:18:08,419
If we're lucky, it's eXotic.
We can trace the sale.

155
00:18:10,024 --> 00:18:12,686
Get your hand out of that man's pocket.

156
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,292
Anyone want some pie?

157
00:18:31,946 --> 00:18:33,538
Gotta go to the john.

158
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:08,180
I had to get it on. He was making a move.
I had to get it on.

159
00:19:21,762 --> 00:19:24,925
Split's in the car.
I took out of ours evenly...

160
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,293
...to make up for his full end...

161
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:33,099
...'cause I want to pay off and get rid
of this motherfucker right now.

162
00:20:11,979 --> 00:20:12,877
Hold it!

163
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,342
Where's the rest?

164
00:21:54,415 --> 00:21:57,213
We're late. You look too good to go out.

165
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,485
I'll just jump you right here.

166
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:05,652
- Where is it?
- Squared the bookies, baby.

167
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:09,193
There's more in a couple of days,
so don't sweat it. We're late.

168
00:22:09,263 --> 00:22:10,195
Come on.

169
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:11,959
You gotta be kidding me.

170
00:22:13,801 --> 00:22:14,733
Honey...

171
00:22:14,902 --> 00:22:19,635
...it ain't worth the risks you take
for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

172
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,772
Let's go.

173
00:22:21,008 --> 00:22:22,373
Get your coat.

174
00:22:24,345 --> 00:22:27,473
There is no point talking.
You're a child growing older.

175
00:22:27,615 --> 00:22:28,980
What does that mean?

176
00:22:29,283 --> 00:22:33,276
We're not making forward progress
like real grown-up adults living our lives...

177
00:22:33,387 --> 00:22:35,582
...because I married a gambling junkie.

178
00:22:36,123 --> 00:22:37,954
Get in the fucking car.

179
00:22:39,693 --> 00:22:41,388
What am I doing in here?

180
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:42,958
You're not!

181
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,498
You want me to leave the bank book
and the car keys...

182
00:22:45,599 --> 00:22:47,464
...in the kitchen on the way out the door?

183
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:50,732
- Are we going?
- Keep that crap. Dominick comes with me.

184
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,270
Don't even think about...

185
00:23:19,934 --> 00:23:22,368
Tell me Albert Torena called back.

186
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:25,500
Albert Torena call Vincent?

187
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,807
No.

188
00:23:28,008 --> 00:23:29,441
Report came in.

189
00:23:30,077 --> 00:23:32,739
The explosive was Dy-Ex,
used in demolition.

190
00:23:32,947 --> 00:23:34,915
You can pick it up in Nevada...

191
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,674
...Arizona, New MeXico.

192
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:38,748
Too common to trace a sale.

193
00:23:39,086 --> 00:23:40,713
That's wonderful.

194
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:01,897
You all right?

195
00:24:02,543 --> 00:24:04,704
What happened? Where have you been?

196
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:06,371
Work.

197
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:09,412
Lauren's dad show up?

198
00:24:11,118 --> 00:24:12,210
Didn't call...

199
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:15,119
...didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

200
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:20,392
Now, does this guy have any idea
what's going on with this kid?

201
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,124
I don't know.

202
00:24:25,132 --> 00:24:26,599
Fucking jerk.

203
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:29,564
Is she okay?

204
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:32,731
She's been in her room all day.

205
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:35,534
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

206
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:37,610
I made dinner...

207
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:39,980
...for us, four hours ago.

208
00:24:41,782 --> 00:24:44,774
Every time I try to maintain
a consistent mood between us...

209
00:24:44,852 --> 00:24:46,217
...you withdraw.

210
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:50,552
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk...

211
00:24:50,924 --> 00:24:53,324
...off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

212
00:24:53,527 --> 00:24:54,926
I'm sorry...

213
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:57,092
...if the goddamn...

214
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,096
...chicken...

215
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,494
...got overcooked.

216
00:25:58,192 --> 00:25:59,352
Coffee, sir?

217
00:25:59,526 --> 00:26:00,493
Please.

218
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,895
Will you pass the cream?

219
00:26:10,637 --> 00:26:11,604
Thanks.

220
00:26:11,705 --> 00:26:12,933
What'd you get?

221
00:26:14,141 --> 00:26:15,039
What?

222
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:17,610
What are you reading?

223
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:24,817
Book about metals.

224
00:26:28,589 --> 00:26:30,523
Stress Fractures in Titanium.

225
00:26:32,826 --> 00:26:34,555
What kind of work do you do?

226
00:26:37,664 --> 00:26:40,963
Lady, why are you so interested
in what I read or what I do?

227
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:47,136
I've seen you in the store.

228
00:26:47,241 --> 00:26:48,503
What store?

229
00:26:48,909 --> 00:26:50,934
Hennessey and Ingalls. I work there.

230
00:26:52,846 --> 00:26:55,337
If you don't want to talk to me, it's okay.

231
00:26:55,516 --> 00:26:57,245
I'm sorry I bothered you.

232
00:27:07,594 --> 00:27:10,757
I didn't mean to be rude.
I didn't recognize you.

233
00:27:11,598 --> 00:27:13,930
I work in metals. I'm a salesman.

234
00:27:14,201 --> 00:27:15,600
My name's Neil.

235
00:27:20,874 --> 00:27:22,102
I'm Eady.

236
00:27:24,945 --> 00:27:26,537
You like working there?

237
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:29,374
Sure.

238
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:33,781
I get a discount and there's
a whole section of books in my area.

239
00:27:33,954 --> 00:27:35,046
What area?

240
00:27:35,556 --> 00:27:37,023
Graphic design.

241
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:41,018
I do letterheads and logotypes
at night and...

242
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:44,629
...the store's a day job
until I get enough going.

243
00:27:44,798 --> 00:27:46,390
Who do you do that for?

244
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,937
A restaurant.

245
00:27:51,405 --> 00:27:53,373
I did their menus, and...

246
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:58,236
...a small record label.

247
00:27:59,413 --> 00:28:00,471
CDs.

248
00:28:00,981 --> 00:28:02,778
I've done two so far.

249
00:28:05,085 --> 00:28:06,814
You go to school for that?

250
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,288
Yeah.

251
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:10,822
I went to Parsons.

252
00:28:10,924 --> 00:28:12,152
Where's that?

253
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,620
New York City.

254
00:28:14,394 --> 00:28:16,021
How long you been here?

255
00:28:17,097 --> 00:28:18,496
About a year.

256
00:28:19,466 --> 00:28:20,433
Like it?

257
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:25,269
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

258
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:34,675
Live in this neighborhood?

259
00:28:34,748 --> 00:28:37,546
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

260
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:41,921
It's a little house I rent.

261
00:28:42,022 --> 00:28:45,651
And it's kind of rundown,
but a beautiful, beautiful view.

262
00:28:47,194 --> 00:28:48,456
What about you?

263
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:49,791
I live up here.

264
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:51,596
That's very funny.

265
00:28:55,702 --> 00:28:58,034
Where's your family from originally?

266
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:02,304
They're Scots-lrish.

267
00:29:03,143 --> 00:29:05,202
They emigrated to Appalachia...

268
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,372
...in the late 1700s.

269
00:29:10,183 --> 00:29:11,650
Where are you from?

270
00:29:12,386 --> 00:29:13,717
The Bay area.

271
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:16,554
Your folks there?

272
00:29:19,593 --> 00:29:22,061
My mother died a long time ago,
and my father...

273
00:29:22,162 --> 00:29:23,754
...I don't know where he is.

274
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:25,491
Got a brother somewhere.

275
00:29:31,338 --> 00:29:33,329
You have a tight family. I can tell.

276
00:29:34,675 --> 00:29:35,733
Right?

277
00:29:35,909 --> 00:29:37,240
You're right.

278
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,681
City of lights...

279
00:29:52,092 --> 00:29:53,684
In Fiji, they have these...

280
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,457
...iridescent algae that come out
once a year in the water.

281
00:29:58,699 --> 00:30:00,894
That's what it looks like out there.

282
00:30:02,102 --> 00:30:03,433
You been there?

283
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:06,705
No, I'm going there some day.

284
00:30:15,782 --> 00:30:17,147
You travel a lot?

285
00:30:20,053 --> 00:30:20,917
Yeah.

286
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:23,285
Travelling makes you lonely?

287
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:30,362
I'm alone. I am not...

288
00:30:30,797 --> 00:30:32,128
...lonely.

289
00:30:32,466 --> 00:30:33,524
You?

290
00:30:35,135 --> 00:30:36,534
Real lonely.

291
00:32:41,561 --> 00:32:42,755
Albert!

292
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:46,591
Shit!

293
00:32:47,434 --> 00:32:50,096
What you doing here? You crazy?
This ain't Disneyland.

294
00:32:51,071 --> 00:32:53,335
You were supposed to get back to me.

295
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:55,338
Where the fuck you been?

296
00:32:56,343 --> 00:32:57,935
I couldn't break free.

297
00:32:58,011 --> 00:33:00,070
Let's violate his ass right now.

298
00:33:00,247 --> 00:33:01,737
I do for you...

299
00:33:02,015 --> 00:33:04,415
...you don't do for me, is that it?

300
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:09,522
Listen, man. I swear, I was out all night.
I'm hidden like a Flamingo matador.

301
00:33:09,689 --> 00:33:12,021
That's got nothing to do with me.

302
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:16,855
I'm cutting it smooth. I'm generating
leads and shit for you. I'm a dancer.

303
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,361
You bullshit.

304
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:21,023
I paged your ass all day.
I hate fucking paging.

305
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:23,695
You're a speed freak,
jacking methamphetamine again.

306
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,705
Where's your empathy?
It's a substance abuse problem.

307
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:30,436
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're
wasting my motherfucking time.

308
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,841
You fall in love?

309
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:34,506
Did you fall in love...

310
00:33:35,448 --> 00:33:37,177
...and went off somewhere?

311
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,514
Tell me that, I'll settle for it.

312
00:33:41,721 --> 00:33:43,188
Give me all you got!

313
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,119
Give me all you got!

314
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:49,057
I swear, my brother Richard's going
to talk to you.

315
00:33:49,296 --> 00:33:50,888
I heard Richard?

316
00:33:51,598 --> 00:33:53,327
He's going to talk to you.

317
00:33:55,068 --> 00:33:56,729
He's gonna meet you tonight.

318
00:33:56,803 --> 00:33:58,327
He's not here, is he?

319
00:33:58,405 --> 00:33:59,872
No, he'll meet you tonight.

320
00:33:59,973 --> 00:34:01,497
What happened to now?

321
00:34:01,842 --> 00:34:05,471
I implored him because I knew
you was coming this a.m.

322
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:06,612
Bullshit.

323
00:34:06,813 --> 00:34:08,713
I swear. He said no...

324
00:34:09,249 --> 00:34:11,217
...'cause he in PhoeniX.

325
00:34:11,418 --> 00:34:13,716
"By the time I get to PhoeniX

326
00:34:14,321 --> 00:34:16,016
"He'll be rising

327
00:34:17,657 --> 00:34:19,488
"He'll probably leave a note

328
00:34:19,826 --> 00:34:21,418
"Right on the door"

329
00:34:21,494 --> 00:34:23,655
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

330
00:34:25,332 --> 00:34:28,301
He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

331
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:31,262
At 2:00 a.m.

332
00:34:31,605 --> 00:34:32,435
Be there.

333
00:34:32,505 --> 00:34:34,097
You be there too.

334
00:34:34,708 --> 00:34:37,142
I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

335
00:34:37,177 --> 00:34:40,044
I got things to do, I got places to be.

336
00:34:41,348 --> 00:34:42,440
Be there.

337
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:51,185
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

338
00:34:54,961 --> 00:34:56,121
What is it?

339
00:34:57,864 --> 00:34:59,126
It's a bank.

340
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:03,069
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution
to all the other branches...

341
00:35:03,136 --> 00:35:05,229
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

342
00:35:05,305 --> 00:35:08,536
So on Thursdays,
the command branch has got a full whack.

343
00:35:08,642 --> 00:35:10,166
On the prowl or strong?

344
00:35:10,243 --> 00:35:11,301
Through the door.

345
00:35:11,378 --> 00:35:12,709
How many guys?

346
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:16,474
About four, or three, plus a driver.
You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

347
00:35:16,549 --> 00:35:20,007
You want $100,000 in advance
against a ten-percent cut for that?

348
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,483
Sounds like a cowboy score.

349
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:26,251
They hit the hold-up alarms,
I gotta get out before the cops show.

350
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,392
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

351
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:31,494
Two Telco and a cellular.

352
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:36,230
But the signals aren't
going anywhere because...

353
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,161
...the night before...

354
00:35:38,405 --> 00:35:39,736
...you cut in...

355
00:35:39,906 --> 00:35:42,500
...and trick out
the alarm system computer...

356
00:35:42,676 --> 00:35:44,007
...to turn itself...

357
00:35:44,077 --> 00:35:46,170
...and the video recorders off...

358
00:35:46,513 --> 00:35:48,481
...20 minutes before you enter.

359
00:35:49,015 --> 00:35:51,074
Architectural, electrical plans?

360
00:35:51,251 --> 00:35:52,240
I got that.

361
00:35:52,352 --> 00:35:55,321
I got the boards already built.
They go into the CPU.

362
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:58,157
What's the estimate?

363
00:36:01,594 --> 00:36:03,255
12.1, 12.2 million.

364
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,858
You're on.

365
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,264
Congratulations.

366
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:14,237
Let me give you a little idea
of where my estimates come from.

367
00:36:14,774 --> 00:36:17,106
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

368
00:36:17,444 --> 00:36:20,277
My way, you get 100 percent
from the insurance company...

369
00:36:20,347 --> 00:36:22,315
...take the bonds back from us...

370
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:25,943
...at 60 cents on the dollar
and make yourself another 40 percent.

371
00:36:27,954 --> 00:36:30,582
The operation doesn't skip a beat.
We all make out.

372
00:36:31,791 --> 00:36:33,224
Sure, you got a deal.

373
00:36:33,994 --> 00:36:37,361
Good, because there's no percentage
if everyone gets upset.

374
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:40,694
You have your man call me
and we'll set the meet.

375
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:42,160
Yeah, okay.

376
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,436
Nice talking to you.

377
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,168
You gonna deal with these guys?

378
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,141
Word's on the street
it's okay to steal my stuff.

379
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:52,878
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

380
00:36:53,013 --> 00:36:56,574
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets
for Canary Island's Offshore.

381
00:37:01,254 --> 00:37:04,018
That's not really an estimate.
Those are eXact figures.

382
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,253
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow
for the past two months.

383
00:37:07,327 --> 00:37:09,192
How'd you get this information?

384
00:37:09,262 --> 00:37:10,627
Just comes to you.

385
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,994
This stuff just flies through the air.

386
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:16,729
It's just beamed out all over the place.
You just have to grab it.

387
00:37:16,836 --> 00:37:18,428
I know how to grab it.

388
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:25,971
Okay, here we go.

389
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:27,980
13.9 million.

390
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:33,085
- I bought it.
- Good.

391
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,987
What did I tell you?

392
00:37:38,792 --> 00:37:39,759
Here.

393
00:37:41,027 --> 00:37:43,928
We're on. Call Van Zant,
collect the money.

394
00:37:45,131 --> 00:37:46,291
How is he?

395
00:37:46,699 --> 00:37:48,166
He's a businessman.

396
00:38:26,406 --> 00:38:27,873
Chris is at my place.

397
00:38:31,010 --> 00:38:32,238
What's wrong?

398
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:34,412
Husband and wife stuff.

399
00:38:35,014 --> 00:38:36,709
I'll let him sleep it off.

400
00:38:51,097 --> 00:38:52,564
What happened to you?

401
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,862
When will you get some furniture?

402
00:38:58,938 --> 00:39:00,633
When I get around to it.

403
00:39:03,276 --> 00:39:05,210
Charlene's gonna leave me.

404
00:39:07,614 --> 00:39:08,444
Why?

405
00:39:11,784 --> 00:39:13,877
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

406
00:39:14,888 --> 00:39:16,981
With everything we've been doing?

407
00:39:18,057 --> 00:39:20,719
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

408
00:39:21,628 --> 00:39:23,596
When you gonna get an old lady?

409
00:39:23,730 --> 00:39:25,391
When I get around to it.

410
00:39:27,767 --> 00:39:29,894
You got something else on the side?

411
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:32,802
Nothing regular.

412
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:35,901
She got something else on the side?

413
00:39:36,342 --> 00:39:37,309
You sure?

414
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:39,945
Yeah, I'm sure.

415
00:39:42,148 --> 00:39:44,116
I don't know what you're doing.

416
00:39:45,652 --> 00:39:49,281
As Jimmy said, " You want to be
making moves on the street?

417
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:53,280
"Have no attachments.
Allow nothing to be in your life...

418
00:39:53,526 --> 00:39:58,054
"...that you can't walk out on in 30 seconds
if you spot the heat around the corner."

419
00:39:58,431 --> 00:39:59,659
Remember that?

420
00:40:06,706 --> 00:40:09,470
For me, the sun rises
and sets with her, man.

421
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:25,889
We take delivery of cash from Van Zant...

422
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,928
...then I drop a deposit on Kelso
for this bank.

423
00:40:29,195 --> 00:40:30,560
Bank? What bank?

424
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,828
What about the platinum thing?
It's ready to fall.

425
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,800
That goes too. Then the bank.

426
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,339
Want some breakfast?

427
00:40:48,815 --> 00:40:50,214
Are you okay?

428
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,049
Yeah, sugar.

429
00:40:59,492 --> 00:41:00,720
For real.

430
00:41:00,793 --> 00:41:01,953
I'll do good.

431
00:41:02,161 --> 00:41:03,628
I'll see you later.

432
00:41:19,512 --> 00:41:20,911
You Solenko?

433
00:41:21,347 --> 00:41:22,507
Don Breedan.

434
00:41:22,615 --> 00:41:26,779
Grierson, my parole officer, told me to
come by here, see if you had a job for me.

435
00:41:26,853 --> 00:41:29,117
You're familiar with this kind of operation?

436
00:41:29,188 --> 00:41:30,917
I'm a great grill man.

437
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,455
Good. Good for you.

438
00:41:32,525 --> 00:41:36,621
You'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher,
bus tables and empty the garbage.

439
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:40,132
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded,
drunk or stealing.

440
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:42,133
I'll violate you back fast.

441
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:45,099
Twenty-five percent of your take-home
kicks back to me.

442
00:41:45,204 --> 00:41:49,436
Rules of the game. Call Grierson,
check it out. Change in the back.

443
00:41:55,782 --> 00:41:57,613
What are you waiting for?

444
00:42:17,337 --> 00:42:19,100
Malibu Equity and Investments.

445
00:42:19,172 --> 00:42:20,696
Roger Van Zant.

446
00:42:20,773 --> 00:42:21,933
Please hold.

447
00:42:25,678 --> 00:42:27,578
This is Roger Van Zant.

448
00:42:28,114 --> 00:42:29,706
I'm supposed to get something.

449
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,944
Someone will call you back
from another line.

450
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:36,752
818-133-6089.

451
00:43:02,582 --> 00:43:06,882
I got a package for you. There's a drive-in
on Centinela. 2:30 tomorrow.

452
00:43:07,086 --> 00:43:09,054
Just send one man, alone.

453
00:43:34,914 --> 00:43:36,848
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

454
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:39,812
- Who was that guy?
- Nobody.

455
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:42,153
I gotta know who he is! Who is he?

456
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:43,448
He's nobody, Neil.

457
00:43:43,523 --> 00:43:46,981
He's a legit liquor salesman
from Las Vegas. Alan Marciano.

458
00:43:47,427 --> 00:43:48,792
Chris will make up.

459
00:43:49,028 --> 00:43:51,690
- It's too late! I'm sick of him!
- Shut up!

460
00:43:53,399 --> 00:43:56,562
Here's the deal. You'll give Chris
one last shot.

461
00:43:56,636 --> 00:44:00,595
After that, he fucks up,
then I will finance setting you up myself...

462
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,201
...on my own, anywhere you want.

463
00:44:03,342 --> 00:44:05,071
Dominick will go with you.

464
00:44:05,244 --> 00:44:07,576
And my word counts. But right now...

465
00:44:07,914 --> 00:44:10,246
...you will give him the chance.

466
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,081
Clean up, go home.

467
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,051
Clean up, go home!

468
00:45:05,137 --> 00:45:06,297
Give me your money.

469
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:08,598
You'll get smoked with that shit.

470
00:45:08,674 --> 00:45:09,868
Won't be you.

471
00:45:13,045 --> 00:45:15,104
He's coming in alone. Send him through.

472
00:45:45,878 --> 00:45:47,539
Vincent, hey, man.

473
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,048
This is my brother, Richard. Vincent.

474
00:45:53,152 --> 00:45:54,676
It's all right.

475
00:45:55,888 --> 00:45:57,788
What have you got for me?

476
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:02,751
Before we even get into that, there's
this crew ripping rides all along the beach.

477
00:46:04,564 --> 00:46:06,759
Now, in the back of a trim shop...

478
00:46:06,933 --> 00:46:10,198
...that somebody wants to pay
a little visit this weekend...

479
00:46:10,236 --> 00:46:13,399
...they might find two Turbos
and a 911 slope.

480
00:46:14,307 --> 00:46:17,037
You looking to rid yourself
of your competition?

481
00:46:18,177 --> 00:46:19,906
I'm a good citizen.

482
00:46:19,979 --> 00:46:21,571
I'm Donald Duck.

483
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:23,746
You got something to tell me?

484
00:46:25,384 --> 00:46:27,147
Check this out, cuz.

485
00:46:28,054 --> 00:46:31,387
How do I know if I tell you
what you need to know...

486
00:46:31,691 --> 00:46:35,092
...that you gonna do
what the fuck I need to get done.

487
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:37,524
Hanna is straight up.

488
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:40,663
I ain't your cuz, you rat motherfucker.

489
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:43,065
And you know because I say so...

490
00:46:43,636 --> 00:46:46,469
...after I hear what the fuck
you got to tell me!

491
00:46:46,539 --> 00:46:47,506
Fuck you.

492
00:46:47,773 --> 00:46:49,070
You understand?

493
00:46:49,308 --> 00:46:51,276
I'd get killed for telling you.

494
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:53,674
You'd get killed walking your doggie!

495
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:55,078
All right, man...

496
00:46:55,615 --> 00:46:58,015
...there was a cat I was locked up with.

497
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:02,018
Did a couple of two, three years.
He got out. I ran into him.

498
00:47:05,391 --> 00:47:06,585
And so?

499
00:47:06,993 --> 00:47:09,120
He's a big fiend for action.

500
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:13,391
Now, if he'd have said nothing,
I'd have thought nothing, but...

501
00:47:13,899 --> 00:47:16,925
...he goes on and on, running down to me
how he ain't done nothing...

502
00:47:17,003 --> 00:47:19,801
...and nothing's been going on
and all this bullshit.

503
00:47:19,872 --> 00:47:21,863
Right then and there I know...

504
00:47:22,408 --> 00:47:25,070
...this cat's got something going down.

505
00:47:32,652 --> 00:47:34,381
Pretty fucking great.

506
00:47:36,122 --> 00:47:38,352
Albert, what's wrong with you?

507
00:47:39,091 --> 00:47:41,924
You drag me here, waste my time like this.

508
00:47:42,662 --> 00:47:45,358
You saw a guy on the street
who's an eX-con?

509
00:47:45,765 --> 00:47:46,857
That's right.

510
00:47:46,932 --> 00:47:48,399
Well, I am...

511
00:47:48,634 --> 00:47:50,329
...over-fucking-whelmed.

512
00:47:50,703 --> 00:47:53,069
What do you want for that,
a G-man badge?

513
00:47:53,606 --> 00:47:56,006
You gonna make the call on them Porches?

514
00:47:56,876 --> 00:47:58,241
Is he kidding me?

515
00:47:59,612 --> 00:48:00,704
I'm telling you:

516
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:02,111
Slick is no joke.

517
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,339
He's double time.

518
00:48:04,417 --> 00:48:05,679
Say what?

519
00:48:06,385 --> 00:48:08,353
"Slick." What does that mean?

520
00:48:08,487 --> 00:48:10,921
That's what he calls people: "Slick."

521
00:48:12,525 --> 00:48:14,186
Tell me about him.

522
00:48:16,395 --> 00:48:18,260
About 6 feet tall...

523
00:48:18,531 --> 00:48:20,499
...lots of jailhouse tats.

524
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:22,760
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

525
00:48:25,271 --> 00:48:26,738
What's his name?

526
00:48:27,807 --> 00:48:29,069
Cheritto.

527
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:31,336
Michael Cheritto.

528
00:48:35,648 --> 00:48:37,878
Thirty-three busts since 1976.

529
00:48:38,384 --> 00:48:40,944
Eleven for armed robbery,
three convictions.

530
00:48:41,087 --> 00:48:43,749
Two out of a three-to-five year beef
in Attica.

531
00:48:43,823 --> 00:48:45,415
Three years in Marion.

532
00:48:45,558 --> 00:48:48,493
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back
to involuntary manslaughter.

533
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:49,824
Jacket's two inches thick.

534
00:48:49,895 --> 00:48:51,863
Who do I have there now?

535
00:48:52,131 --> 00:48:54,656
- Drucker and me. And Schwartz.
- Tell SIS...

536
00:48:54,967 --> 00:48:58,698
...I want full surveillance. That's 24 hours.
Round the clock, day and night.

537
00:48:58,771 --> 00:49:00,739
We never close. Open every day.

538
00:49:01,207 --> 00:49:03,038
Bug the car, the house, the work.

539
00:49:03,109 --> 00:49:05,009
When he moves or sits,
like in a restaurant...

540
00:49:05,077 --> 00:49:07,875
...I want pictures of who he moves
and sits with.

541
00:49:08,214 --> 00:49:11,581
Then run makes on them.
They got jackets, trail them.

542
00:49:11,817 --> 00:49:14,285
I want it up and running
by tomorrow night.

543
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:12,004
Put your hands where I can see them.

544
00:50:12,211 --> 00:50:14,406
Put your hands where I can see them.

545
00:50:15,247 --> 00:50:16,544
I tell you what to do.

546
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:18,511
I tell you how to do it.

547
00:50:19,318 --> 00:50:22,754
Now, with your right hand only,
your right hand only...

548
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:26,858
...take the package and throw it in here.

549
00:50:44,944 --> 00:50:45,876
Behind you.

550
00:50:45,945 --> 00:50:46,912
On the right.

551
00:52:06,492 --> 00:52:07,959
Roger Van Zant.

552
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:09,687
Who's this?

553
00:52:10,162 --> 00:52:11,629
You know who this is.

554
00:52:12,564 --> 00:52:13,895
Yes, I do.

555
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,368
I sent a guy to deliver the package.

556
00:52:16,468 --> 00:52:18,663
He didn't call. Is everything okay?

557
00:52:19,471 --> 00:52:21,735
I tell you what, forget the money.

558
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:23,172
What?

559
00:52:24,076 --> 00:52:25,703
Forget the money.

560
00:52:28,141 --> 00:52:32,202
It's a lot of money. What are you doing?
What do you mean, "forget the money"?

561
00:52:32,278 --> 00:52:35,213
What am I doing?
I'm talking to an empty telephone.

562
00:52:36,082 --> 00:52:37,549
I don't understand.

563
00:52:38,084 --> 00:52:41,281
'Cause there is a dead man
on the other end of this line.

564
00:53:02,475 --> 00:53:03,772
Do you like it?

565
00:53:03,877 --> 00:53:05,276
Look at my ring.

566
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:11,911
Did you know?

567
00:53:13,419 --> 00:53:14,909
You are insane.

568
00:53:20,326 --> 00:53:21,315
Do you like it?

569
00:53:21,427 --> 00:53:23,395
- It's beautiful.
- It's good.

570
00:53:23,563 --> 00:53:25,497
Don't ask him where he got it.

571
00:53:34,274 --> 00:53:36,640
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

572
00:53:36,976 --> 00:53:38,204
I don't know.

573
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,646
Just like me.

574
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:44,273
I don't know either.

575
00:53:58,831 --> 00:53:59,923
Hello?

576
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:01,828
It's me.

577
00:54:03,569 --> 00:54:05,628
I was wondering if you'd call.

578
00:54:07,273 --> 00:54:08,604
I've been busy.

579
00:54:08,908 --> 00:54:10,205
Can I see you?

580
00:54:10,643 --> 00:54:12,577
I was afraid that was just...

581
00:54:13,479 --> 00:54:15,071
...the one night.

582
00:54:16,182 --> 00:54:18,047
Not for me, it wasn't.

583
00:54:20,586 --> 00:54:22,053
Yeah, me neither.

584
00:54:24,257 --> 00:54:25,724
Can I fall by?

585
00:54:27,093 --> 00:54:28,185
Yeah.

586
00:54:28,428 --> 00:54:30,328
I'll see you in a little bit.

587
00:54:43,443 --> 00:54:44,603
All right.

588
00:54:45,411 --> 00:54:47,140
Goddamn convention.

589
00:54:48,381 --> 00:54:50,576
- Which one's Slick?
- The wide one.

590
00:54:50,883 --> 00:54:52,612
We got two transmitters.

591
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:55,650
One's in the wheel well,
backup's in the firewall.

592
00:54:55,722 --> 00:54:56,711
Here we are.

593
00:54:56,823 --> 00:54:58,791
Did you say good night to Neil?

594
00:54:59,625 --> 00:55:01,593
The blond is Chris Shiherlis.

595
00:55:01,694 --> 00:55:05,221
SIS has got a revolving tail
and hung a wire on the house phone.

596
00:55:07,734 --> 00:55:10,931
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals
depository three times.

597
00:55:11,004 --> 00:55:13,336
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

598
00:55:14,273 --> 00:55:16,935
Sammy and I think that's going to be
their neXt score.

599
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:18,375
Who's the loner?

600
00:55:21,547 --> 00:55:23,037
First time we're seeing him.

601
00:55:23,149 --> 00:55:24,707
We're not on him yet.

602
00:55:26,853 --> 00:55:28,184
Get on it.

603
00:55:45,972 --> 00:55:50,705
When these guys walk out the door of
whatever score they're gonna take neXt...

604
00:55:52,612 --> 00:55:55,775
...they're gonna have the surprise
of a lifetime.

605
00:56:11,531 --> 00:56:13,158
Baby, time to go.

606
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:17,167
Showed you a good time, didn't I?

607
00:56:20,673 --> 00:56:21,867
You fly.

608
00:56:22,041 --> 00:56:23,303
You cool.

609
00:56:30,917 --> 00:56:34,648
You're lying to me.
I can always tell when people lie to me.

610
00:56:35,521 --> 00:56:36,886
I ain't lying.

611
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:39,057
You a hot dog.

612
00:56:39,692 --> 00:56:41,557
A regular rodeo rider.

613
00:56:42,195 --> 00:56:45,255
And this was the monster fuck
of my young life.

614
00:56:49,802 --> 00:56:52,600
Now, I got to get my ass street-side, sugar.

615
00:56:52,638 --> 00:56:54,902
You don't have a truth-telling style.

616
00:56:55,074 --> 00:56:56,871
What are you talking about?

617
00:56:57,043 --> 00:56:59,170
You don't know what this is.

618
00:57:05,685 --> 00:57:08,153
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

619
00:57:27,073 --> 00:57:28,472
Where have you been?

620
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:31,605
SHU at Pelican Bay.

621
00:57:31,944 --> 00:57:33,673
And Folsom, B-wing.

622
00:57:34,714 --> 00:57:36,306
I am a cowboy...

623
00:57:36,983 --> 00:57:38,883
...looking for anything heavy.

624
00:57:38,985 --> 00:57:41,078
Billy said to come see you.

625
00:57:41,821 --> 00:57:43,686
That is why I am here.

626
00:57:52,832 --> 00:57:54,959
Why don't you call this guy?

627
00:57:56,402 --> 00:57:58,666
This guy's always putting guys on.

628
00:58:02,842 --> 00:58:03,900
Thank you.

629
00:58:18,291 --> 00:58:20,191
You're perfect for each other.

630
00:58:25,998 --> 00:58:27,898
I knew a guy in grade school.

631
00:58:28,234 --> 00:58:30,429
His name was Raoul... whatever.

632
00:58:30,636 --> 00:58:34,231
You could take his fingers
and fold them over each other.

633
00:58:34,507 --> 00:58:36,566
He'd turn his eyelids inside out...

634
00:58:36,642 --> 00:58:39,668
I can't keep my hands off you.
That's the truth.

635
00:58:41,180 --> 00:58:43,842
That's what's so wonderful
about you in that...

636
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,577
...bestial sort of way.

637
00:58:50,256 --> 00:58:51,382
Woman.

638
00:58:58,197 --> 00:59:00,165
This better be earth-shattering.

639
00:59:07,039 --> 00:59:08,438
This is to Raoul.

640
00:59:10,776 --> 00:59:12,437
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

641
00:59:54,754 --> 00:59:56,585
Here's how we found her.

642
01:00:00,860 --> 01:00:01,758
How old?

643
01:00:01,827 --> 01:00:04,489
16, 17. Been here about siX hours.

644
01:00:05,698 --> 01:00:07,165
How'd she die?

645
01:00:07,266 --> 01:00:10,667
Beat her head in, same as the others.
Cerebral hematoma.

646
01:00:13,539 --> 01:00:14,699
Who's that?

647
01:00:15,241 --> 01:00:16,572
Mother and siblings.

648
01:00:16,642 --> 01:00:18,473
- Why are they here?
- It's fucked up.

649
01:00:18,544 --> 01:00:21,479
Somebody inside knew the girl
and called the family.

650
01:00:22,615 --> 01:00:23,775
Let's go.

651
01:00:28,521 --> 01:00:29,613
Nice.

652
01:00:30,523 --> 01:00:34,482
My intuition says the check on the semen
will show it's the same guy...

653
01:00:34,593 --> 01:00:37,687
...so it's a series and ending up
in your court.

654
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:39,622
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

655
01:00:39,699 --> 01:00:40,927
Not yet.

656
01:00:42,301 --> 01:00:43,768
Get off of me!

657
01:00:46,706 --> 01:00:47,968
Oh, my God!

658
01:00:52,278 --> 01:00:53,506
Where is she?

659
01:00:53,813 --> 01:00:55,371
Easy, easy, easy.

660
01:00:58,651 --> 01:01:00,118
Please, come on.

661
01:01:03,022 --> 01:01:04,887
It's okay. It's okay.

662
01:01:06,158 --> 01:01:07,625
Where is my baby?

663
01:01:07,793 --> 01:01:08,987
Where is she?

664
01:01:09,829 --> 01:01:12,024
I need to know what happened.

665
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:56,333
I guess the earth shattered.

666
01:01:57,143 --> 01:01:59,941
So why didn't you let Bosko
take you home?

667
01:02:01,847 --> 01:02:04,145
I didn't want to ruin their night too.

668
01:02:04,583 --> 01:02:05,914
What was it?

669
01:02:07,987 --> 01:02:09,477
You don't want to know.

670
01:02:09,588 --> 01:02:12,785
I'd like to know what's behind
that grim look on your face.

671
01:02:12,925 --> 01:02:15,393
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

672
01:02:16,095 --> 01:02:18,529
You never told me I'd be eXcluded.

673
01:02:20,599 --> 01:02:22,567
I told you when we hooked up...

674
01:02:22,668 --> 01:02:24,932
...that you were gonna have to share me...

675
01:02:25,004 --> 01:02:28,770
...with all the bad people
and all the ugly events on this planet.

676
01:02:28,941 --> 01:02:31,102
And I bought into that sharing...

677
01:02:31,377 --> 01:02:33,004
...because I love you.

678
01:02:33,446 --> 01:02:37,177
I love you fat, bald, money,
no money, driving a bus.

679
01:02:37,316 --> 01:02:38,510
I don't care.

680
01:02:39,685 --> 01:02:42,449
But you have got to be present
like a normal guy.

681
01:02:42,521 --> 01:02:45,581
That's sharing.
This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

682
01:02:45,691 --> 01:02:48,319
What I should do is come home and say:

683
01:02:49,195 --> 01:02:52,687
"Hi, honey, guess what?
I walked into this house today...

684
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:56,859
"...where this junkie asshole
just fried his baby in a microwave...

685
01:02:56,969 --> 01:03:00,427
"...because he was crying too loud,
so let me share that with you.

686
01:03:00,506 --> 01:03:03,339
"Come on, let's share that
and in sharing it...

687
01:03:03,542 --> 01:03:08,036
"...we'll somehow cathartically dispel
all that heinous shit."

688
01:03:08,714 --> 01:03:09,646
Right?

689
01:03:12,218 --> 01:03:13,185
Wrong.

690
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:14,713
You know why?

691
01:03:14,787 --> 01:03:17,051
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

692
01:03:17,923 --> 01:03:19,390
We fuck and you don't speak.

693
01:03:19,458 --> 01:03:21,619
'Cause I got to hold onto my angst.

694
01:03:22,228 --> 01:03:23,661
I preserve it...

695
01:03:23,829 --> 01:03:27,196
...because I need it.
It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

696
01:03:27,666 --> 01:03:28,997
Where I gotta be.

697
01:03:36,342 --> 01:03:38,071
You don't live with me.

698
01:03:40,646 --> 01:03:43,308
You live among the remains
of dead people.

699
01:03:47,253 --> 01:03:49,448
You sift through the detritus.

700
01:03:50,856 --> 01:03:52,653
You read the terrain.

701
01:03:53,926 --> 01:03:56,360
You search for signs of passing...

702
01:03:57,029 --> 01:03:59,088
...for the scent of your prey...

703
01:03:59,164 --> 01:04:01,132
...and then you hunt them down.

704
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:05,464
That's the only thing you're committed to.

705
01:04:08,908 --> 01:04:11,775
The rest is the mess you leave
as you pass through.

706
01:04:17,049 --> 01:04:20,485
What I don't understand is
why I can't cut loose of you.

707
01:04:40,239 --> 01:04:41,729
Let's go, baby.

708
01:04:44,577 --> 01:04:46,238
I met the manager.

709
01:04:46,645 --> 01:04:48,112
Is that the boss?

710
01:04:49,248 --> 01:04:52,217
I did time for what that motherfucker
does every day.

711
01:04:52,585 --> 01:04:56,021
Can you just handle it
till we find you something new?

712
01:04:57,089 --> 01:04:58,681
Can you do that?

713
01:05:00,759 --> 01:05:03,728
Ain't a hard time been invented
that I cannot handle.

714
01:05:09,835 --> 01:05:11,735
What you're hanging with me for?

715
01:05:13,539 --> 01:05:15,439
Because I'm proud of you.

716
01:05:21,347 --> 01:05:22,814
You're proud of me?

717
01:05:27,786 --> 01:05:29,879
Why the hell are you proud of me?

718
01:05:31,457 --> 01:05:32,856
Come on home.

719
01:05:43,702 --> 01:05:45,431
What were you doing there?

720
01:05:45,638 --> 01:05:47,105
I was skiing.

721
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:49,069
I was trying to ski.

722
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:52,844
That's what people do there.
You go skiing...

723
01:05:53,646 --> 01:05:55,477
...and you meet people.

724
01:05:55,814 --> 01:05:57,406
You try to have a good time.

725
01:05:57,483 --> 01:05:59,144
- Did you have a good time?
- No.

726
01:05:59,218 --> 01:06:00,378
Why not?

727
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,687
I'm not good at meeting people.

728
01:06:03,155 --> 01:06:04,520
You met me.

729
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:07,758
That happened without my thinking
about it.

730
01:06:08,227 --> 01:06:10,161
Which is why I probably...

731
01:06:10,796 --> 01:06:12,855
No, it's because you are fine.

732
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:20,161
Take off with me for a while.

733
01:06:21,573 --> 01:06:22,505
Where?

734
01:06:23,108 --> 01:06:24,507
New Zealand.

735
01:06:25,811 --> 01:06:26,903
When?

736
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:31,174
I have to go separate.
You can meet me there.

737
01:06:31,684 --> 01:06:33,151
But my job...

738
01:06:33,252 --> 01:06:35,413
I got money. You don't need money.

739
01:06:35,521 --> 01:06:37,989
You could set up a studio and work there.

740
01:06:38,424 --> 01:06:39,618
I don't know.

741
01:06:39,692 --> 01:06:41,216
What's there to know?

742
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,827
Are you married?

743
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:45,522
What?

744
01:06:45,698 --> 01:06:47,757
The last thing I am is married.

745
01:06:47,933 --> 01:06:50,868
I'm a needle starting at zero
going the other way.

746
01:06:51,036 --> 01:06:52,731
Then, all of a sudden...

747
01:06:53,639 --> 01:06:55,698
...someone like you comes along.

748
01:06:59,378 --> 01:07:00,345
You don't know me.

749
01:07:00,412 --> 01:07:01,879
I know enough.

750
01:07:05,884 --> 01:07:07,283
Come with me.

751
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:18,629
What's wrong?

752
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:23,232
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right.
Will you go?

753
01:07:28,173 --> 01:07:29,231
Yeah.

754
01:07:32,978 --> 01:07:33,945
Good.

755
01:07:58,937 --> 01:08:00,336
Hi, sweetie.

756
01:08:01,707 --> 01:08:04,175
You forget your mom was picking you up?

757
01:08:05,878 --> 01:08:06,867
No.

758
01:08:09,014 --> 01:08:10,777
So, what's going on?

759
01:08:12,618 --> 01:08:14,347
I felt like being alone.

760
01:08:17,289 --> 01:08:19,189
Come on, I'll drive you home.

761
01:09:15,948 --> 01:09:17,142
What's happening?

762
01:09:19,218 --> 01:09:20,048
Sir.

763
01:09:20,118 --> 01:09:22,780
Captain Jackson wants to know
what's going on.

764
01:09:23,322 --> 01:09:25,756
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

765
01:10:20,078 --> 01:10:21,340
Technique.

766
01:10:40,866 --> 01:10:42,857
Open Sesame. Right there.

767
01:11:40,659 --> 01:11:42,058
There he is.

768
01:12:44,790 --> 01:12:45,518
We walk!

769
01:12:45,590 --> 01:12:46,420
I'm there.

770
01:12:46,491 --> 01:12:47,458
We walk!

771
01:13:02,808 --> 01:13:04,139
He's heard it.

772
01:13:12,551 --> 01:13:13,518
Heads up.

773
01:13:15,487 --> 01:13:17,614
- One's coming out.
- Hold it, Captain.

774
01:13:17,689 --> 01:13:19,953
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

775
01:13:20,258 --> 01:13:21,225
I see.

776
01:13:24,463 --> 01:13:26,761
- Here we go.
- Not till my boss says so.

777
01:13:26,832 --> 01:13:29,198
Both of them are not carrying anything.

778
01:13:38,310 --> 01:13:39,971
- Let them go.
- What do you mean?

779
01:13:40,045 --> 01:13:41,342
We can take them on!

780
01:13:41,413 --> 01:13:42,505
On what?

781
01:13:42,681 --> 01:13:44,512
They didn't steal anything.

782
01:13:44,816 --> 01:13:49,276
It gets knocked back to a misdemeanor,
they do siX months and they're out.

783
01:13:49,621 --> 01:13:50,747
No fucking way.

784
01:13:50,822 --> 01:13:54,087
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.
They are not walking.

785
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:57,754
That's eXactly what they'll do.
They'll walk. This is my operation.

786
01:13:57,829 --> 01:14:00,627
I have tactical command
that supersedes your rank.

787
01:14:00,699 --> 01:14:03,862
They will walk away
and you will let them. Fuck!

788
01:14:49,748 --> 01:14:51,215
Back to work.

789
01:14:53,151 --> 01:14:56,780
LAPD, the G, what?
Where the fuck did this heat come from?

790
01:14:57,389 --> 01:15:00,358
Maybe it's the score they were onto.
The place, not us.

791
01:15:00,458 --> 01:15:02,926
Because it's been hit a couple of times.

792
01:15:03,128 --> 01:15:07,292
Assume they got our phones, our houses.
Assume they got us right here, right now...

793
01:15:07,365 --> 01:15:09,833
...as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

794
01:15:10,335 --> 01:15:12,428
How are we gonna buy the bank package?

795
01:15:12,504 --> 01:15:14,028
I'll front that.

796
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:15,868
What if Van Zant has 750?

797
01:15:16,074 --> 01:15:19,942
With the heat we got, you want to play
World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

798
01:15:20,011 --> 01:15:21,672
No, I want my 750.

799
01:15:22,247 --> 01:15:26,513
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant
than either of you. He is a fucking luXury.

800
01:15:26,585 --> 01:15:29,247
Our problem is to take the bank,
or split right now.

801
01:15:29,354 --> 01:15:31,549
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

802
01:15:31,923 --> 01:15:36,383
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone
on our separate ways. That's it.

803
01:15:41,499 --> 01:15:43,467
The bank is worth the risk.

804
01:15:43,735 --> 01:15:45,202
I need it, brother.

805
01:15:46,871 --> 01:15:50,068
We should stay and take it down.
That's where I come out.

806
01:16:01,086 --> 01:16:03,179
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

807
01:16:03,722 --> 01:16:05,280
- Whatever.
- Not on this one.

808
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:07,491
On this one, you're on your own.

809
01:16:20,472 --> 01:16:22,872
You figure this is the best thing to do?

810
01:16:23,041 --> 01:16:25,236
This is the best thing to do?

811
01:16:25,644 --> 01:16:29,171
I've got plans, I'm going away after,
so the reward is worth the stretch.

812
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:32,307
But Elaine takes good care of you.
You got plenty put away.

813
01:16:32,384 --> 01:16:34,579
You got T-bonds, real estate.

814
01:16:34,686 --> 01:16:37,519
If I were you, I would be smart
and cut loose of this.

815
01:16:55,774 --> 01:16:57,036
For me...

816
01:16:57,242 --> 01:16:59,335
...the action is the juice.

817
01:16:59,978 --> 01:17:00,945
I'm in.

818
01:17:06,918 --> 01:17:08,283
Yeah, sure.

819
01:17:08,453 --> 01:17:09,545
Let's go.

820
01:17:10,355 --> 01:17:12,186
Fuck them, let's do it.

821
01:17:12,357 --> 01:17:14,655
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

822
01:17:31,976 --> 01:17:33,807
Tim, I gotta call you back.

823
01:17:34,145 --> 01:17:36,511
- Can I help you?
- Are you Alan Marciano?

824
01:17:36,715 --> 01:17:38,046
Who the fuck are you?

825
01:17:38,116 --> 01:17:39,276
Who am I?

826
01:17:40,018 --> 01:17:42,248
Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, LAPD.

827
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:45,756
LA? This is Las Vegas.
You don't even have jurisdiction here.

828
01:17:47,192 --> 01:17:50,753
Do you know who the fuck you're pushing
around? I know people here.

829
01:17:50,962 --> 01:17:53,430
Las Vegas PD takes you into custody.

830
01:17:55,433 --> 01:17:59,597
You are eXtradited to Newark
on a warrant for smuggling cigarettes...

831
01:17:59,637 --> 01:18:01,867
...up from North Carolina three years ago...

832
01:18:01,940 --> 01:18:03,908
...or you go to work for us.

833
01:18:04,309 --> 01:18:05,776
Cut and dried.

834
01:18:06,244 --> 01:18:07,609
That is it.

835
01:18:07,912 --> 01:18:09,004
Shit.

836
01:18:09,981 --> 01:18:11,710
Charlene Shiherlis.

837
01:18:12,217 --> 01:18:13,047
Who?

838
01:18:13,218 --> 01:18:14,082
Who?

839
01:18:14,486 --> 01:18:16,317
What are you, a fucking owl?

840
01:18:16,454 --> 01:18:20,390
The lady you been talking dirty to
on the telephone every day last week.

841
01:18:20,792 --> 01:18:22,453
You can't tie me to her.

842
01:18:22,794 --> 01:18:26,821
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane
back to New Jersey, jackoff.

843
01:18:29,134 --> 01:18:30,829
Why did I get miXed up with her?

844
01:18:30,902 --> 01:18:33,370
Because she got a great ass!

845
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:37,870
And you got your head all the way up it.

846
01:18:38,977 --> 01:18:39,944
Jesus.

847
01:18:40,578 --> 01:18:42,045
Ferocious, aren't I?

848
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,311
When I think of asses...

849
01:18:44,382 --> 01:18:45,849
...a woman's ass...

850
01:18:46,418 --> 01:18:48,318
...something comes out of me.

851
01:18:49,821 --> 01:18:50,480
So?

852
01:18:50,555 --> 01:18:51,920
So, no big thing.

853
01:18:52,891 --> 01:18:54,358
All I want...

854
01:18:54,692 --> 01:18:57,354
...is her husband
and his whole fucking crew.

855
01:18:58,062 --> 01:18:59,825
You'll work with Sgt. Drucker.

856
01:19:04,335 --> 01:19:06,667
San Clemente Road and Hermosa...

857
01:19:07,071 --> 01:19:10,040
...that's where we cut through the fence.
That's the access.

858
01:19:10,108 --> 01:19:11,075
Right.

859
01:19:11,342 --> 01:19:13,867
The security systems around here
are a joke.

860
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,583
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge,
that's escape route number one.

861
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,487
Number two:

862
01:19:23,621 --> 01:19:25,589
Over here. Anaheim to the 110.

863
01:19:26,157 --> 01:19:27,055
Good.

864
01:19:27,525 --> 01:19:28,423
You got it?

865
01:19:28,493 --> 01:19:29,892
Good. Let's go.

866
01:19:52,550 --> 01:19:54,142
They were looking back...

867
01:19:55,587 --> 01:19:57,145
...in this direction.

868
01:19:57,922 --> 01:19:59,719
A container facility?

869
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,315
What? Cartage theft?

870
01:20:01,392 --> 01:20:03,360
Too visible. Too lowball for them.

871
01:20:08,299 --> 01:20:10,597
There's an oil refinery and a scrap yard.

872
01:20:10,635 --> 01:20:12,000
Refinery pays by check.

873
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:13,367
No cash around.

874
01:20:13,671 --> 01:20:15,229
Same for the scrap yard.

875
01:20:18,743 --> 01:20:20,074
Stealing hubcaps?

876
01:20:24,215 --> 01:20:26,342
A refinery and a scrap yard.

877
01:20:27,785 --> 01:20:29,412
What the hell is going on?

878
01:20:29,487 --> 01:20:31,580
That's what we are trying to figure out.

879
01:20:32,423 --> 01:20:34,220
We thought we had it.

880
01:20:34,959 --> 01:20:36,324
Thought we had it.

881
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:47,562
I got an idea...

882
01:20:48,506 --> 01:20:50,440
...on what they're looking at.

883
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:56,376
Want to know what they're looking at?

884
01:20:58,182 --> 01:21:01,083
I mean, is this guy something,
or is he something?

885
01:21:02,587 --> 01:21:04,248
This crew is good.

886
01:21:06,925 --> 01:21:08,085
You want to know?

887
01:21:09,327 --> 01:21:10,419
What?

888
01:21:11,796 --> 01:21:12,785
Us.

889
01:21:14,265 --> 01:21:15,527
The LAPD.

890
01:21:16,367 --> 01:21:18,232
The police department.

891
01:21:19,571 --> 01:21:21,038
We just got made.

892
01:21:29,147 --> 01:21:30,239
Yeah!

893
01:21:38,790 --> 01:21:39,882
Okay!

894
01:21:49,601 --> 01:21:51,068
Okay, motherfucker!

895
01:22:11,956 --> 01:22:13,423
Kelso come through?

896
01:22:13,791 --> 01:22:16,259
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

897
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,733
Name is Hanna.

898
01:22:24,035 --> 01:22:25,502
First name, Vincent.

899
01:22:26,137 --> 01:22:28,128
I smeared this sergeant five yards.

900
01:22:28,206 --> 01:22:29,696
Hanna's all over you.

901
01:22:30,541 --> 01:22:33,305
He's on all the work cars.
Michael's house. Shiherlis's.

902
01:22:33,378 --> 01:22:35,812
Not yours. They've been losing you
at night.

903
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:37,177
He's a hot dog.

904
01:22:37,415 --> 01:22:39,713
Graduate school. Marine Corps.

905
01:22:40,318 --> 01:22:42,149
Lieutenant in Robbery-Homicide.

906
01:22:42,220 --> 01:22:45,815
He's taken down some heavy crews.
He blew away Frankie in Chicago.

907
01:22:45,890 --> 01:22:47,551
He was a fucking maniac.

908
01:22:48,426 --> 01:22:50,690
He was working narcotics before that.

909
01:22:51,162 --> 01:22:53,528
Divorced twice. Current wife's Justine.

910
01:22:53,598 --> 01:22:55,259
He's why the eXtra heat.

911
01:22:58,069 --> 01:22:59,730
The vice sergeant...

912
01:23:01,072 --> 01:23:03,006
...says Hanna likes you...

913
01:23:04,008 --> 01:23:07,444
...thinks you're some kind of star.
You do this sharp, that sharp.

914
01:23:07,512 --> 01:23:09,980
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

915
01:23:12,417 --> 01:23:13,941
Funny as a heart attack.

916
01:23:14,018 --> 01:23:17,545
Three marriages? Do you think that means
he likes staying home?

917
01:23:18,256 --> 01:23:20,724
Means he's one of those guys out there...

918
01:23:20,925 --> 01:23:23,655
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

919
01:23:25,997 --> 01:23:28,431
With him and this much heat,
you should pass.

920
01:23:35,740 --> 01:23:37,367
It's worth the stretch.

921
01:23:38,342 --> 01:23:40,310
This guy can hit or miss.

922
01:23:40,778 --> 01:23:42,439
You can't miss once.

923
01:23:43,247 --> 01:23:44,407
You sure?

924
01:23:45,550 --> 01:23:46,881
I am sure.

925
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:54,157
Let's go to the garage.

926
01:24:22,787 --> 01:24:24,254
Where are we going?

927
01:24:29,393 --> 01:24:30,860
Where are you going?

928
01:24:31,362 --> 01:24:32,420
Out.

929
01:25:31,088 --> 01:25:32,146
What are they on?

930
01:25:32,223 --> 01:25:33,485
TAC 9.

931
01:25:35,359 --> 01:25:39,295
They're northbound out LAX on the 405.
We got four ground units.

932
01:25:58,015 --> 01:26:00,745
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.
Who have I got?

933
01:26:01,118 --> 01:26:03,086
This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.

934
01:26:03,321 --> 01:26:06,757
Richard Glover's with me.
It's on the 105 eastbound...

935
01:26:07,124 --> 01:26:08,887
...approaching the 110.

936
01:26:09,794 --> 01:26:11,125
Revolving tail?

937
01:26:11,429 --> 01:26:14,023
I got two units in front, three behind.

938
01:26:14,298 --> 01:26:17,563
Have one of them pick me up
at the Vermont on-ramp.

939
01:26:18,536 --> 01:26:19,798
Let's go.

940
01:27:09,887 --> 01:27:13,516
Am I 100 yards, or what?
Am I close or far, or what?

941
01:27:13,991 --> 01:27:16,050
Three hundred yards, center lane.

942
01:28:23,194 --> 01:28:24,525
How're you doing?

943
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:30,861
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

944
01:28:37,341 --> 01:28:38,672
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

945
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:40,672
Follow me.

946
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:58,325
Seven years in Folsom.

947
01:28:59,063 --> 01:29:00,894
In the hole for three.

948
01:29:01,032 --> 01:29:02,499
McNeil before that.

949
01:29:05,836 --> 01:29:07,804
McNeil as tough as they say?

950
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,008
You looking to become a penologist?

951
01:29:12,243 --> 01:29:13,904
You looking to go back?

952
01:29:14,145 --> 01:29:18,206
I chased down some crews. Guys just
looking to fuck up, get busted back.

953
01:29:18,382 --> 01:29:19,474
That you?

954
01:29:20,684 --> 01:29:22,982
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

955
01:29:23,721 --> 01:29:25,450
I worked all kinds.

956
01:29:28,793 --> 01:29:32,729
You see me doing liquor store holdup
with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

957
01:29:33,998 --> 01:29:34,965
I do not.

958
01:29:35,566 --> 01:29:36,533
Right.

959
01:29:38,135 --> 01:29:39,966
I am never going back.

960
01:29:41,639 --> 01:29:43,766
Then don't take down scores.

961
01:29:45,042 --> 01:29:46,703
I do what I do best.

962
01:29:46,877 --> 01:29:50,813
I take scores. You do what you do best:
Try to stop guys like me.

963
01:29:54,685 --> 01:29:56,949
You never wanted a regular type life?

964
01:29:57,721 --> 01:30:00,417
What is that? The barbecues
and the ball games?

965
01:30:02,493 --> 01:30:03,425
Yeah.

966
01:30:05,896 --> 01:30:07,955
This regular type like your life?

967
01:30:08,666 --> 01:30:10,634
My life? No, my life...

968
01:30:12,403 --> 01:30:14,098
My life's a disaster zone.

969
01:30:15,940 --> 01:30:18,465
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

970
01:30:19,009 --> 01:30:22,103
...because her real father
is this large-type asshole.

971
01:30:22,179 --> 01:30:23,476
I got a wife.

972
01:30:23,547 --> 01:30:26,345
We're passing each other
on the down slope of a marriage.

973
01:30:26,417 --> 01:30:27,475
My third.

974
01:30:29,587 --> 01:30:33,353
Because I spend all my time
chasing guys like you around the block.

975
01:30:33,424 --> 01:30:34,755
That's my life.

976
01:30:41,265 --> 01:30:43,028
Guy told me one time:

977
01:30:44,835 --> 01:30:49,272
"Don't get attached to anything
you can't walk out on in 30 seconds...

978
01:30:49,340 --> 01:30:51,808
"...if you feel the heat around the corner."

979
01:30:53,277 --> 01:30:56,474
If you're on me and you got to move
when I move...

980
01:30:56,847 --> 01:30:59,577
...how do you eXpect to keep a marriage?

981
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:03,550
That's an interesting point.

982
01:31:05,089 --> 01:31:06,317
What are you, a monk?

983
01:31:07,691 --> 01:31:08,953
I have a woman.

984
01:31:09,493 --> 01:31:10,960
What do you tell her?

985
01:31:13,397 --> 01:31:15,126
I tell her I'm a salesman.

986
01:31:21,906 --> 01:31:24,966
So, if you spot me coming
around that corner...

987
01:31:25,976 --> 01:31:27,876
...you'll just walk out on her?

988
01:31:29,413 --> 01:31:31,040
Not say good-bye?

989
01:31:31,815 --> 01:31:33,476
That's the discipline.

990
01:31:34,318 --> 01:31:36,115
That's pretty vacant.

991
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,947
It is what it is.

992
01:31:38,088 --> 01:31:40,886
It's that, or we both better go do
something else.

993
01:31:42,860 --> 01:31:44,828
I don't know how to do anything else.

994
01:31:45,329 --> 01:31:46,762
Neither do I.

995
01:31:49,567 --> 01:31:51,125
I don't want to either.

996
01:31:51,902 --> 01:31:53,096
Neither do I.

997
01:32:00,811 --> 01:32:03,405
You know, I have this recurring dream.

998
01:32:05,282 --> 01:32:08,251
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

999
01:32:08,319 --> 01:32:11,948
...all the victims of all the murders
I ever worked are sitting there...

1000
01:32:12,022 --> 01:32:15,617
...and they're staring at me
with these black eyeballs...

1001
01:32:16,594 --> 01:32:20,530
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages
from the head wounds.

1002
01:32:21,799 --> 01:32:24,859
And there they are,
these big balloon people...

1003
01:32:25,569 --> 01:32:28,766
...because I found them two weeks
after they'd been under the bed.

1004
01:32:29,540 --> 01:32:32,008
The neighbors reported the smell...

1005
01:32:32,977 --> 01:32:34,638
...and there they are...

1006
01:32:34,712 --> 01:32:36,441
...all just sitting there.

1007
01:32:38,649 --> 01:32:39,843
What do they say?

1008
01:32:41,885 --> 01:32:42,852
Nothing.

1009
01:32:43,320 --> 01:32:44,548
No talk?

1010
01:32:46,724 --> 01:32:48,487
They have nothing to say.

1011
01:32:49,393 --> 01:32:51,361
We just look at each other.

1012
01:32:52,329 --> 01:32:53,990
They look at me...

1013
01:32:54,498 --> 01:32:56,659
...and that's it. That's the dream.

1014
01:32:59,503 --> 01:33:01,403
I have one where I'm drowning.

1015
01:33:02,139 --> 01:33:05,802
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing
or I'll die in my sleep.

1016
01:33:07,911 --> 01:33:09,276
What's that about?

1017
01:33:10,914 --> 01:33:12,347
Having enough time.

1018
01:33:14,018 --> 01:33:15,246
Enough time...

1019
01:33:15,653 --> 01:33:17,416
...to do what you want to do?

1020
01:33:17,588 --> 01:33:18,850
That's right.

1021
01:33:21,358 --> 01:33:22,757
You doing it now?

1022
01:33:22,893 --> 01:33:24,155
No, not yet.

1023
01:33:29,767 --> 01:33:31,735
You know, we're sitting here...

1024
01:33:33,103 --> 01:33:35,333
...like a couple of regular fellas.

1025
01:33:35,506 --> 01:33:37,974
You do what you do,
and I do what I gotta do.

1026
01:33:40,377 --> 01:33:42,777
Now that we've been face to face...

1027
01:33:45,716 --> 01:33:48,378
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away...

1028
01:33:48,719 --> 01:33:50,186
...I won't like it.

1029
01:33:51,055 --> 01:33:52,215
But, I tell you...

1030
01:33:54,792 --> 01:33:56,760
...if it's between you...

1031
01:33:56,960 --> 01:34:00,794
...and some poor bastard whose wife
you're gonna turn into a widow...

1032
01:34:01,732 --> 01:34:02,960
...brother...

1033
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:05,265
...you are going down.

1034
01:34:17,815 --> 01:34:20,147
There's a flip side to that coin.

1035
01:34:22,419 --> 01:34:24,649
What if you do got me boXed in...

1036
01:34:25,055 --> 01:34:26,852
...and I gotta put you down?

1037
01:34:27,991 --> 01:34:29,720
Because no matter what...

1038
01:34:30,260 --> 01:34:32,228
...you won't get in my way.

1039
01:34:33,497 --> 01:34:35,727
We've been face to face, yeah.

1040
01:34:39,036 --> 01:34:40,765
But I will not hesitate.

1041
01:34:41,105 --> 01:34:42,504
Not for a second.

1042
01:34:48,912 --> 01:34:50,379
Maybe that'll happen.

1043
01:34:53,117 --> 01:34:54,175
Or...

1044
01:34:54,518 --> 01:34:55,849
...who knows?

1045
01:34:56,453 --> 01:34:58,819
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1046
01:35:14,638 --> 01:35:16,162
They dumped us.

1047
01:35:17,441 --> 01:35:18,305
What?

1048
01:35:18,942 --> 01:35:20,409
They dumped us.

1049
01:35:21,011 --> 01:35:22,273
What do you mean?

1050
01:35:22,346 --> 01:35:23,506
Chris slipped away.

1051
01:35:23,647 --> 01:35:25,638
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1052
01:35:25,716 --> 01:35:29,117
...so there's nothing for me to get
from Marciano. I just tried.

1053
01:35:29,453 --> 01:35:31,444
- What about Cheritto?
- Same.

1054
01:35:31,555 --> 01:35:34,217
Transponders got put on a bus
to San Clemente.

1055
01:35:36,860 --> 01:35:38,725
They dumped all our surveillance?

1056
01:35:38,796 --> 01:35:41,026
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1057
01:35:42,266 --> 01:35:45,497
I had coffee with McCauley
half an hour ago!

1058
01:35:45,702 --> 01:35:46,669
We were on you.

1059
01:35:46,737 --> 01:35:50,400
Then McCauley drives in to LAX
where surveillance can't fly over.

1060
01:35:51,375 --> 01:35:53,809
His car's still there. He's gone.

1061
01:35:59,216 --> 01:36:03,744
Does anybody have any idea
where the fuck these people are?

1062
01:37:03,580 --> 01:37:04,547
Hear from him?

1063
01:37:05,549 --> 01:37:09,542
Not a thing. And not hearing
bothers me more. Where's this guy?

1064
01:37:12,189 --> 01:37:13,087
This guy...

1065
01:37:13,156 --> 01:37:14,589
...we put him on.

1066
01:37:14,758 --> 01:37:16,419
Says he knows McCauley.

1067
01:37:22,132 --> 01:37:23,064
Who are you?

1068
01:37:24,334 --> 01:37:25,562
Waingro.

1069
01:37:26,103 --> 01:37:27,764
My name's Waingro.

1070
01:37:28,105 --> 01:37:31,302
I've been living in this office.
How well do you know him?

1071
01:37:32,676 --> 01:37:35,167
We took some major scores together.

1072
01:37:39,116 --> 01:37:41,016
Why haven't I heard from him?

1073
01:37:41,351 --> 01:37:43,285
He's probably busy right now.

1074
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:45,281
But he's real thorough.

1075
01:37:46,623 --> 01:37:48,784
He ain't going to forget about you.

1076
01:37:49,092 --> 01:37:50,491
That's reassuring.

1077
01:37:52,296 --> 01:37:54,787
I got some moves I could make here.

1078
01:37:55,966 --> 01:37:58,196
Probably be a big help to you.

1079
01:38:19,656 --> 01:38:21,317
You recognize the grill man?

1080
01:38:29,333 --> 01:38:29,992
No.

1081
01:38:30,067 --> 01:38:30,897
Folsom.

1082
01:38:31,068 --> 01:38:33,468
D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

1083
01:38:35,072 --> 01:38:36,596
I ain't got my break yet.

1084
01:38:36,673 --> 01:38:38,868
Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

1085
01:38:39,109 --> 01:38:41,771
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

1086
01:38:42,212 --> 01:38:43,770
Take your break later.

1087
01:38:44,281 --> 01:38:45,748
Piece of shit.

1088
01:38:45,983 --> 01:38:47,143
Pick up!

1089
01:38:50,420 --> 01:38:51,944
Where the hell is he?

1090
01:38:52,089 --> 01:38:54,557
I want to check the slot for the work car.

1091
01:38:54,625 --> 01:38:55,592
So did I.

1092
01:39:03,533 --> 01:39:04,500
Hang on.

1093
01:39:07,537 --> 01:39:10,938
Use the land line. Call me at 103-7206.

1094
01:39:24,454 --> 01:39:25,785
Where are you?

1095
01:39:25,889 --> 01:39:28,653
There's cops all over me, man,
like a cheap suit.

1096
01:39:29,126 --> 01:39:30,525
I can't dump them.

1097
01:39:33,130 --> 01:39:34,791
They know you see them?

1098
01:39:35,232 --> 01:39:37,132
They're doing parallels.

1099
01:39:39,836 --> 01:39:41,394
I can try to dump them again.

1100
01:39:41,471 --> 01:39:43,666
How are we going to know if you did?

1101
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,401
You'll draw them to us.

1102
01:39:45,909 --> 01:39:46,933
Go to Ventura.

1103
01:39:47,010 --> 01:39:48,341
Pull them out of here.

1104
01:39:48,412 --> 01:39:51,848
I'm sorry. Last thing I wanted to do
was let you down.

1105
01:40:18,442 --> 01:40:19,238
Pick up.

1106
01:40:21,978 --> 01:40:23,536
Neil, man. What's up?

1107
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,772
What's up?

1108
01:40:24,848 --> 01:40:26,611
What are you doing here?

1109
01:40:26,883 --> 01:40:30,410
I'm looking for a driver
who can handle scanners on the radio.

1110
01:40:30,487 --> 01:40:31,818
Right now, today.

1111
01:40:32,122 --> 01:40:33,487
You remember the drill?

1112
01:40:33,557 --> 01:40:34,819
Yeah, sure.

1113
01:40:34,991 --> 01:40:36,151
You cool?

1114
01:40:36,860 --> 01:40:38,521
You know I'm cool.

1115
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:41,730
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

1116
01:40:55,879 --> 01:40:58,712
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1117
01:41:00,150 --> 01:41:01,742
Out back in five.

1118
01:41:12,095 --> 01:41:13,494
What's burning?

1119
01:41:13,997 --> 01:41:15,225
What is this?

1120
01:41:15,999 --> 01:41:18,024
Where do you think you're going?

1121
01:42:54,130 --> 01:42:56,223
Don't move! Put your hands in the air!

1122
01:42:56,366 --> 01:42:57,424
Hands up!

1123
01:42:57,500 --> 01:42:59,161
Put them up! Now!

1124
01:43:00,704 --> 01:43:01,602
Get on your knees!

1125
01:43:01,671 --> 01:43:02,638
The keys!

1126
01:43:03,773 --> 01:43:05,263
Get on your knees!

1127
01:43:09,546 --> 01:43:10,672
Get over there!

1128
01:43:12,482 --> 01:43:13,312
Turn around!

1129
01:43:13,383 --> 01:43:15,078
Put your hands behind you!

1130
01:43:15,151 --> 01:43:16,118
Get down!

1131
01:43:16,186 --> 01:43:17,278
Stay down!

1132
01:43:18,288 --> 01:43:19,152
Get down!

1133
01:43:22,092 --> 01:43:24,083
- Down!
- The keys! The keys!

1134
01:43:29,399 --> 01:43:30,388
Stay down!

1135
01:43:31,268 --> 01:43:34,260
We want to hurt no one.
We want the bank's money, not yours.

1136
01:43:34,337 --> 01:43:37,363
Your money is insured by the government.
You won't lose a dime.

1137
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:39,032
Think of your families.

1138
01:43:39,109 --> 01:43:40,974
Don't risk your life. Don't be a hero.

1139
01:43:41,811 --> 01:43:46,043
I want you to sit on the floor, put your
hands on your head. Anybody feels sick...

1140
01:43:46,449 --> 01:43:49,009
...anybody got heart trouble,
lean against the wall.

1141
01:43:50,387 --> 01:43:51,354
The key.

1142
01:43:51,621 --> 01:43:52,883
What key?

1143
01:43:54,824 --> 01:43:56,724
Sit down and stay down!

1144
01:43:57,928 --> 01:44:00,556
Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1145
01:44:49,946 --> 01:44:51,971
Get down. Down, down, down.

1146
01:44:52,048 --> 01:44:53,515
Put your heads down!

1147
01:45:19,075 --> 01:45:21,543
You guys working a case
on a Neil McCauley?

1148
01:45:21,611 --> 01:45:24,273
This C.I., Hugh Benny,
called in about a bank.

1149
01:45:27,917 --> 01:45:30,147
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1150
01:45:48,371 --> 01:45:50,635
I want a block at Figueroa and Fifth...

1151
01:45:50,774 --> 01:45:53,834
...and I want a block
northbound Flower at SiXth.

1152
01:46:32,048 --> 01:46:33,845
They're already coming out.

1153
01:46:34,417 --> 01:46:36,476
We gotta take them in the car.

1154
01:46:36,619 --> 01:46:38,450
Wait till they are all in.

1155
01:46:38,655 --> 01:46:41,089
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1156
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:51,899
Police! Move!

1157
01:46:53,336 --> 01:46:54,735
Move. Move. Get down.

1158
01:47:16,860 --> 01:47:18,225
Move it. Down, down.

1159
01:47:21,898 --> 01:47:23,126
We did it!

1160
01:47:27,370 --> 01:47:28,462
Move!

1161
01:47:34,711 --> 01:47:35,973
Get down!

1162
01:47:45,455 --> 01:47:46,479
Get in the car!

1163
01:48:03,573 --> 01:48:04,801
Go! Go!

1164
01:49:05,368 --> 01:49:06,357
Go!

1165
01:49:31,394 --> 01:49:32,224
Go!

1166
01:51:47,438 --> 01:51:48,769
Get down!

1167
01:52:02,120 --> 01:52:05,180
Out of the way! Get them down! Now!

1168
01:53:05,917 --> 01:53:07,248
Come here.

1169
01:53:52,763 --> 01:53:54,094
I got you.

1170
01:53:58,236 --> 01:54:02,832
Tragedy in the neighborhood today.
A bank robbery spilled out into the street.

1171
01:54:03,174 --> 01:54:06,200
Claudia Newman, live on the scene.
She has the latest.

1172
01:54:06,444 --> 01:54:10,403
This afternoon, a neighborhood was
terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.

1173
01:54:10,581 --> 01:54:14,415
With the streets full of shoppers and kids,
police and armed robbers...

1174
01:54:14,485 --> 01:54:15,952
EXcuse me, bartender.

1175
01:54:16,053 --> 01:54:19,682
Our top story tonight:
Robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.

1176
01:54:20,024 --> 01:54:23,187
A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken
by a bank robbery...

1177
01:54:23,327 --> 01:54:25,795
...that ended in homicide and terror.

1178
01:54:26,063 --> 01:54:27,462
Michael Cheritto...

1179
01:54:27,532 --> 01:54:31,525
...one of four men involved
in the foiled robbery, died at the scene.

1180
01:54:31,769 --> 01:54:33,066
Also fatally wounded:

1181
01:54:33,137 --> 01:54:36,504
...another suspect, Donald Breedan,
who died of gunshot wounds...

1182
01:54:36,574 --> 01:54:40,169
...during the extensive gunfire
between police and suspects.

1183
01:54:42,280 --> 01:54:43,770
All right, hold him.

1184
01:54:44,081 --> 01:54:45,605
It's all right.

1185
01:54:53,858 --> 01:54:54,688
So?

1186
01:54:54,792 --> 01:54:56,692
He's got blood loss and shock.

1187
01:54:56,827 --> 01:55:00,627
I'll give you quarter-grain bottles
of morphine for the pain.

1188
01:55:01,566 --> 01:55:02,726
Bottom line?

1189
01:55:03,200 --> 01:55:05,964
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good.

1190
01:55:06,404 --> 01:55:08,804
His clavicle's fractured. Can you rest?

1191
01:55:09,473 --> 01:55:10,599
SiX, seven hours.

1192
01:55:10,675 --> 01:55:12,267
- That's it?
- That's it.

1193
01:55:12,643 --> 01:55:14,110
Take off your shirt.

1194
01:55:14,211 --> 01:55:14,939
What?

1195
01:55:16,747 --> 01:55:18,214
Take off your shirt.

1196
01:55:26,691 --> 01:55:28,124
My daughter gave it to me.

1197
01:55:28,192 --> 01:55:30,422
I don't give a shit. Take it off.

1198
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:43,968
Listen to me.

1199
01:55:44,342 --> 01:55:48,335
Nate's going to pick you up.
He's going to take you to his place.

1200
01:55:49,680 --> 01:55:51,045
Where's Charlene?

1201
01:55:51,182 --> 01:55:55,016
We gotta go. We're on the 6 o'clock news.
We gotta get out of here.

1202
01:55:55,386 --> 01:55:57,411
I'm not going without her.

1203
01:55:57,755 --> 01:55:59,120
Think about that.

1204
01:55:59,390 --> 01:56:01,221
I will meet you at Nate's.

1205
01:56:01,425 --> 01:56:02,915
Where are you going?

1206
01:56:03,127 --> 01:56:06,893
To find out if our out got spilled
along with every other damn thing.

1207
01:56:07,164 --> 01:56:08,426
Who did it?

1208
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:11,131
Who wasn't there?

1209
01:56:12,670 --> 01:56:13,637
Trejo.

1210
01:56:17,575 --> 01:56:18,940
See you at Nate's.

1211
01:56:27,485 --> 01:56:28,884
You still want me?

1212
01:56:29,120 --> 01:56:32,317
You come down here right now
and you get me. Dominick and me.

1213
01:56:33,524 --> 01:56:34,684
Okay, baby.

1214
01:56:35,092 --> 01:56:37,083
I'll be there in two hours.

1215
01:56:38,396 --> 01:56:39,488
All right.

1216
01:56:41,465 --> 01:56:42,898
Goddamn you, Chris.

1217
01:56:43,401 --> 01:56:44,561
Goddamn you.

1218
01:56:45,536 --> 01:56:47,766
You're on a plane to Los Angeles.

1219
01:56:47,972 --> 01:56:48,961
Right.

1220
01:57:37,388 --> 01:57:39,515
Why did you do it? What happened?

1221
01:57:40,891 --> 01:57:42,449
- They made me.
- Who?

1222
01:57:42,593 --> 01:57:43,582
Where's Anna?

1223
01:57:45,229 --> 01:57:46,355
She's dead.

1224
01:57:49,300 --> 01:57:52,428
So is Michael and Breedan,
the guy who stood in for you.

1225
01:57:52,937 --> 01:57:54,097
Who did it?

1226
01:57:54,238 --> 01:57:55,205
Who did it?

1227
01:57:55,272 --> 01:57:57,001
They had Anna, man.

1228
01:57:57,208 --> 01:57:58,072
Who?

1229
01:57:59,643 --> 01:58:00,610
Waingro.

1230
01:58:01,579 --> 01:58:02,807
Waingro.

1231
01:58:03,581 --> 01:58:04,741
On his own?

1232
01:58:06,717 --> 01:58:08,378
- For someone.
- Who?

1233
01:58:09,754 --> 01:58:11,551
The other he worked for.

1234
01:58:13,224 --> 01:58:14,486
Van Zant.

1235
01:58:17,461 --> 01:58:18,485
Van Zant?

1236
01:58:23,033 --> 01:58:24,261
Are you sure?

1237
01:58:24,802 --> 01:58:26,064
Van Zant.

1238
01:58:27,838 --> 01:58:30,204
Did you tell them how we're getting out?

1239
01:58:31,308 --> 01:58:32,775
I don't think so.

1240
01:58:33,577 --> 01:58:34,544
Come on.

1241
01:58:36,514 --> 01:58:38,106
I don't remember.

1242
01:58:43,487 --> 01:58:44,647
I'll call a medic.

1243
01:58:44,722 --> 01:58:46,622
I'm not going to make it.

1244
01:58:48,859 --> 01:58:50,986
I can't feel a bloody thing.

1245
01:58:53,197 --> 01:58:54,721
My Anna's gone.

1246
01:58:57,301 --> 01:58:58,666
She's gone.

1247
01:59:00,938 --> 01:59:02,929
Don't leave me like this.

1248
01:59:03,941 --> 01:59:05,272
Please, homes.

1249
01:59:06,577 --> 01:59:08,568
Don't leave me like this.

1250
01:59:35,472 --> 01:59:37,997
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1251
01:59:38,876 --> 01:59:40,173
It's a new one.

1252
01:59:41,612 --> 01:59:44,080
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1253
01:59:44,415 --> 01:59:45,575
10725.

1254
01:59:46,150 --> 01:59:47,310
10725.

1255
01:59:47,985 --> 01:59:48,952
Chris?

1256
01:59:49,453 --> 01:59:51,216
He's with me, my place.

1257
01:59:51,488 --> 01:59:53,251
NeXt, Waingro, okay?

1258
01:59:55,693 --> 01:59:57,024
You got the time?

1259
01:59:57,962 --> 01:59:59,395
I'll make time.

1260
01:59:59,730 --> 02:00:01,197
And I need a new out.

1261
02:00:02,199 --> 02:00:03,359
Is it blown?

1262
02:00:05,102 --> 02:00:06,763
How can I trust it?

1263
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:11,034
You got it.

1264
02:00:12,042 --> 02:00:13,509
Stay healthy.

1265
02:00:19,016 --> 02:00:20,677
Charlene Shiherlis.

1266
02:00:21,585 --> 02:00:24,554
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice
to stash her in.

1267
02:00:24,622 --> 02:00:26,055
Neil's transportation.

1268
02:00:26,223 --> 02:00:30,182
Get on the phone. Somewhere, someone's
trying to put it together for him.

1269
02:00:30,561 --> 02:00:32,961
You don't believe he already had a plan?

1270
02:00:33,063 --> 02:00:34,690
Sure. Now he needs another.

1271
02:00:34,765 --> 02:00:37,290
Would you trust yours
after this afternoon?

1272
02:00:38,569 --> 02:00:41,060
This rat motherfucker,
where did we get him?

1273
02:00:41,138 --> 02:00:44,699
He's a C.I. For a burglary cop.
Called in the tip on the bank.

1274
02:00:44,875 --> 02:00:46,502
On Neil McCauley.

1275
02:00:46,677 --> 02:00:48,144
How much time we got?

1276
02:00:48,612 --> 02:00:53,276
Eight, ten hours for him to set up
a new out. After that, he's gone, bye-bye.

1277
02:01:46,937 --> 02:01:49,735
You ratted McCauley to us!
How'd you know?

1278
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:51,271
Who told you?

1279
02:01:51,642 --> 02:01:53,940
Who told you, rat motherfucker?

1280
02:01:54,311 --> 02:01:55,369
Who?

1281
02:02:40,024 --> 02:02:41,514
Waingro, where is he?

1282
02:02:42,726 --> 02:02:43,590
Where?

1283
02:02:43,660 --> 02:02:45,025
How would I know?

1284
02:03:10,821 --> 02:03:11,879
Well...

1285
02:03:12,423 --> 02:03:14,220
...what do we have here?

1286
02:03:15,125 --> 02:03:16,353
This pretty?

1287
02:03:16,427 --> 02:03:17,553
This pretty?

1288
02:03:21,131 --> 02:03:22,359
You piece of shit.

1289
02:03:22,433 --> 02:03:25,561
Told me you wanted out from under.
You're scared, right?

1290
02:03:25,836 --> 02:03:27,667
You want out? This is out.

1291
02:03:27,738 --> 02:03:30,969
- Yeah, what's your end?
- I don't need no stupid broad.

1292
02:03:31,508 --> 02:03:32,975
How'd I get into this?

1293
02:03:33,077 --> 02:03:33,975
Easy.

1294
02:03:34,845 --> 02:03:37,245
You heard me. She had a rough ride.

1295
02:03:37,581 --> 02:03:38,741
FiX her a drink.

1296
02:03:38,816 --> 02:03:40,716
Look in the cabinet above the sink.

1297
02:03:40,784 --> 02:03:41,842
Fuck her.

1298
02:03:44,254 --> 02:03:46,916
You better get in there and stay in there.

1299
02:03:50,461 --> 02:03:51,860
Lookie here.

1300
02:03:53,363 --> 02:03:55,627
My name is Sgt. Drucker, LAPD Homicide.

1301
02:03:55,699 --> 02:03:57,724
You want to put Dominick
in the bedroom?

1302
02:03:57,935 --> 02:03:59,368
He stays with me.

1303
02:04:10,013 --> 02:04:11,412
So, what now?

1304
02:04:14,218 --> 02:04:15,344
He's right.

1305
02:04:15,419 --> 02:04:17,478
You want out? This is out.

1306
02:04:19,323 --> 02:04:21,587
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1307
02:04:21,658 --> 02:04:22,886
No shit.

1308
02:04:23,460 --> 02:04:25,860
That's right. You would have to.

1309
02:04:26,463 --> 02:04:29,899
See, if you don't betray Chris,
you victimize Dominick.

1310
02:04:31,268 --> 02:04:34,795
'Cause he becomes an orphan
when you go to prison as an accessory...

1311
02:04:34,872 --> 02:04:39,639
...'cause you got no parents to take him.
So he ends up raised in foster homes...

1312
02:04:39,710 --> 02:04:41,610
...juvenile facilities.

1313
02:04:41,845 --> 02:04:43,608
Then he steals a car.

1314
02:04:44,314 --> 02:04:48,444
Then he winds up in gladiator academies
like Chino and Tracy.

1315
02:04:49,820 --> 02:04:51,412
Fucked for life.

1316
02:04:53,290 --> 02:04:56,020
You know what happens,
because you've been there.

1317
02:04:57,594 --> 02:05:01,758
Dominick didn't get a chance yet
to choose his life. But Chris did.

1318
02:05:03,901 --> 02:05:06,631
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1319
02:05:07,604 --> 02:05:09,003
You can do it...

1320
02:05:09,339 --> 02:05:11,603
...for your kid, so you can raise him.

1321
02:05:15,612 --> 02:05:17,011
What else are you selling?

1322
02:05:17,080 --> 02:05:18,479
All kinds of shit.

1323
02:05:19,950 --> 02:05:24,785
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1324
02:05:31,528 --> 02:05:32,859
Here's an update.

1325
02:05:32,996 --> 02:05:34,759
Drucker's on Line 2.

1326
02:05:35,132 --> 02:05:36,690
Hold on for a second.

1327
02:05:39,036 --> 02:05:40,697
Drucker's on the other line.

1328
02:05:41,805 --> 02:05:42,931
Conference him in.

1329
02:05:44,274 --> 02:05:45,172
Go ahead.

1330
02:05:45,709 --> 02:05:47,336
Vincent, it's me.

1331
02:05:50,013 --> 02:05:52,174
One answer. What's it going to be?

1332
02:05:59,156 --> 02:06:01,716
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1333
02:06:01,792 --> 02:06:04,260
That's good. Here's the deal.

1334
02:06:05,295 --> 02:06:08,128
Hugh Benny has reformed
his wayward life...

1335
02:06:08,565 --> 02:06:11,056
...and become a born-again good citizen.

1336
02:06:11,335 --> 02:06:15,328
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us
by this cowboy named Waingro.

1337
02:06:15,973 --> 02:06:20,637
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew,
then went to work for a money launderer.

1338
02:06:20,911 --> 02:06:22,173
Van Zant.

1339
02:06:23,714 --> 02:06:25,739
Units are at Van Zant's house
as we speak...

1340
02:06:25,816 --> 02:06:28,478
...because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1341
02:06:28,685 --> 02:06:31,984
If Neil goes after anybody else,
it's going to be Waingro.

1342
02:06:32,189 --> 02:06:35,750
Waingro just got himself a suite
at the Airport Marquis...

1343
02:06:35,826 --> 02:06:37,760
...under the name Jamieson.

1344
02:06:37,995 --> 02:06:42,159
He's there now. I want you to get that
to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1345
02:06:42,466 --> 02:06:45,458
...assignment officers
and snitches in County.

1346
02:06:45,936 --> 02:06:49,929
Anyone you can think of who'll put it
on the street. Deploy a team at the hotel...

1347
02:06:50,007 --> 02:06:52,669
...and personally check their coms
every 30 minutes.

1348
02:06:52,743 --> 02:06:55,177
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1349
02:06:55,679 --> 02:06:57,010
How're you feeling?

1350
02:06:57,514 --> 02:06:59,072
Hang up, but I'll live.

1351
02:07:08,258 --> 02:07:09,486
He's here.

1352
02:07:10,360 --> 02:07:12,021
Neil is still here.

1353
02:07:13,196 --> 02:07:14,686
I can feel it.

1354
02:07:15,532 --> 02:07:16,999
For how long?

1355
02:07:18,502 --> 02:07:20,470
Seven, eight hours, maX.

1356
02:07:29,846 --> 02:07:31,177
What did you do?

1357
02:07:31,581 --> 02:07:32,548
That was you?

1358
02:07:33,116 --> 02:07:34,845
I don't sell metal.

1359
02:07:35,719 --> 02:07:38,711
Would have been okay, you fly out after.
Now it's jammed.

1360
02:07:38,889 --> 02:07:40,481
We gotta go together.

1361
02:07:40,924 --> 02:07:43,017
Those other people were with you?

1362
02:07:44,828 --> 02:07:46,420
My friend, Michael...

1363
02:07:48,131 --> 02:07:49,655
...he knew the risks.

1364
02:07:54,604 --> 02:07:56,663
When it rains, you get wet.

1365
02:07:59,443 --> 02:08:00,705
Get packed.

1366
02:08:20,097 --> 02:08:21,792
Why did you do this to me?

1367
02:08:33,977 --> 02:08:35,376
Lt'll be all right.

1368
02:08:35,445 --> 02:08:37,037
Do you understand?

1369
02:08:42,018 --> 02:08:43,815
It's going to be all right.

1370
02:08:55,265 --> 02:08:58,428
There's a Camaro at this address,
Level D, Slot 18.

1371
02:09:03,673 --> 02:09:05,140
Here's some cash.

1372
02:09:08,145 --> 02:09:09,442
When is it over?

1373
02:09:12,849 --> 02:09:14,544
Twenty-two hours from now.

1374
02:09:14,885 --> 02:09:18,548
- Then we get out of here clean.
- When will you let me leave?

1375
02:09:22,492 --> 02:09:23,550
Go now.

1376
02:09:23,627 --> 02:09:25,618
You want out? There's the door.

1377
02:09:26,196 --> 02:09:28,187
Will you let me leave later?

1378
02:09:33,336 --> 02:09:34,894
It will be different.

1379
02:09:36,540 --> 02:09:38,303
Do you even understand?

1380
02:10:09,239 --> 02:10:10,604
It's ready.

1381
02:10:18,315 --> 02:10:20,146
This is my friend Ralph.

1382
02:10:20,750 --> 02:10:22,741
You didn't tell me you were...

1383
02:10:23,587 --> 02:10:24,952
Oh, my God!

1384
02:10:25,121 --> 02:10:26,383
Where's Lauren?

1385
02:10:26,723 --> 02:10:28,520
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1386
02:10:29,159 --> 02:10:31,059
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

1387
02:10:31,127 --> 02:10:32,355
What are you sorry about?

1388
02:10:32,429 --> 02:10:33,589
Sit down.

1389
02:10:34,231 --> 02:10:35,630
Don't you even get angry?

1390
02:10:36,833 --> 02:10:37,925
I'm angry.

1391
02:10:39,669 --> 02:10:41,534
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1392
02:10:42,105 --> 02:10:44,903
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1393
02:10:46,743 --> 02:10:49,439
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1394
02:10:51,248 --> 02:10:53,113
In her eX-husband's...

1395
02:10:53,617 --> 02:10:56,677
...dead-tech, post-modernistic,
bullshit house...

1396
02:10:56,753 --> 02:10:58,152
...if you want to.

1397
02:11:00,524 --> 02:11:02,754
But you do not get to watch...

1398
02:11:03,460 --> 02:11:05,018
...my fucking...

1399
02:11:05,562 --> 02:11:06,790
...television set!

1400
02:11:06,863 --> 02:11:08,228
For God's sake.

1401
02:11:15,071 --> 02:11:16,902
Put the television set down.

1402
02:11:17,007 --> 02:11:19,635
- I never cheated on you, bitch.
- Maybe you should have.

1403
02:11:19,709 --> 02:11:21,870
- I should have?
- You're a party to this.

1404
02:11:21,945 --> 02:11:25,176
I made Ralph fuck you
because it makes me feel good.

1405
02:11:25,248 --> 02:11:26,909
Our situation is absurd.

1406
02:11:29,486 --> 02:11:31,511
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1407
02:11:35,191 --> 02:11:39,093
Why is it that I have to figure things out
and eXplain them to you?

1408
02:11:39,262 --> 02:11:41,594
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1409
02:11:42,132 --> 02:11:43,224
How admirable.

1410
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:45,598
- You bet.
- EXcept none of it's about us.

1411
02:11:46,236 --> 02:11:47,203
No.

1412
02:11:48,672 --> 02:11:51,505
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but...

1413
02:11:52,475 --> 02:11:54,602
...you walk through our life dead.

1414
02:11:55,312 --> 02:11:59,408
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph
just to get closure with you.

1415
02:12:12,429 --> 02:12:14,829
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1416
02:12:15,332 --> 02:12:16,594
The plane...

1417
02:12:17,000 --> 02:12:20,026
...charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1418
02:12:20,303 --> 02:12:22,203
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1419
02:12:25,475 --> 02:12:26,669
Touches down...

1420
02:12:26,743 --> 02:12:29,303
...holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1421
02:12:29,546 --> 02:12:33,073
The plane will stand an FAA check.
Filed a flight plan, the works.

1422
02:12:34,618 --> 02:12:35,710
Where's Chris?

1423
02:12:36,286 --> 02:12:37,344
He's gone.

1424
02:12:38,755 --> 02:12:39,722
What?

1425
02:12:40,457 --> 02:12:42,857
Said he's going on his own.
Went to find Charlene.

1426
02:12:42,926 --> 02:12:45,224
- Did you bring him here?
- Yeah, I did.

1427
02:12:46,196 --> 02:12:47,254
What happened?

1428
02:12:48,365 --> 02:12:49,923
It's a free country.

1429
02:12:55,171 --> 02:12:57,002
Check in with me at 9:00...

1430
02:12:57,374 --> 02:12:59,171
...everything is still cool.

1431
02:13:00,877 --> 02:13:02,037
All right.

1432
02:13:25,402 --> 02:13:27,734
I don't know what I'm doing anymore.

1433
02:13:31,007 --> 02:13:32,804
I know life is short.

1434
02:13:33,443 --> 02:13:35,536
Whatever time you get is luck.

1435
02:13:38,248 --> 02:13:39,806
You want to walk?

1436
02:13:42,652 --> 02:13:44,449
You walk right now...

1437
02:13:46,056 --> 02:13:47,648
...all on your own.

1438
02:13:48,324 --> 02:13:50,986
On your own you choose to come with me.

1439
02:13:57,400 --> 02:13:58,992
All I know is...

1440
02:14:01,271 --> 02:14:04,536
...there's no point in me
going anywhere anymore...

1441
02:14:06,109 --> 02:14:08,100
...if it's going to be alone...

1442
02:14:09,145 --> 02:14:10,669
...without you.

1443
02:15:10,707 --> 02:15:11,765
I got a live one.

1444
02:15:12,742 --> 02:15:13,902
I'll hold.

1445
02:15:16,613 --> 02:15:18,080
Show yourself.

1446
02:15:19,182 --> 02:15:20,774
- Do it.
- Shut up!

1447
02:15:25,121 --> 02:15:27,351
Now, just one second at the window...

1448
02:15:28,591 --> 02:15:30,388
...and it's all over.

1449
02:17:20,370 --> 02:17:21,462
Hey, man...

1450
02:17:23,740 --> 02:17:26,402
...you know any place to rent around here?

1451
02:17:44,327 --> 02:17:45,351
It's not him.

1452
02:17:45,428 --> 02:17:46,793
It's not Chris.

1453
02:17:54,938 --> 02:17:56,633
Unit 2, this is Command.

1454
02:17:57,106 --> 02:17:58,437
Take him at the street.

1455
02:17:58,574 --> 02:17:59,802
Check him out.

1456
02:18:27,403 --> 02:18:28,870
He's John Peterson.

1457
02:18:28,938 --> 02:18:31,338
Valid ID. Car's registered to...

1458
02:18:31,507 --> 02:18:33,168
...Bukowski, Gene.

1459
02:18:33,810 --> 02:18:34,970
Ran it to DMV.

1460
02:18:35,044 --> 02:18:36,341
It's clean.

1461
02:18:39,315 --> 02:18:40,407
Let him go.

1462
02:18:40,984 --> 02:18:42,076
Roger.

1463
02:18:42,352 --> 02:18:44,343
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1464
02:18:46,322 --> 02:18:47,186
It's no-go.

1465
02:18:57,567 --> 02:19:00,400
Would you like a cup of coffee
while we wait?

1466
02:19:00,503 --> 02:19:02,232
Yeah, that would be nice.

1467
02:19:33,369 --> 02:19:34,734
What do you got?

1468
02:19:34,804 --> 02:19:36,271
Nothing's happening.

1469
02:19:49,485 --> 02:19:50,952
Hello, it's Vincent.

1470
02:19:51,587 --> 02:19:52,679
What do you got?

1471
02:19:52,755 --> 02:19:54,985
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1472
02:19:55,558 --> 02:19:56,650
That's it.

1473
02:20:05,435 --> 02:20:06,766
You know what?

1474
02:20:09,305 --> 02:20:10,772
Neil is gone.

1475
02:20:15,845 --> 02:20:17,437
Flying like a bird.

1476
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:19,311
How do you know?

1477
02:20:21,417 --> 02:20:22,349
We still got bait!

1478
02:20:22,418 --> 02:20:24,511
- Maybe some time!
- What do we got?

1479
02:20:24,687 --> 02:20:26,018
What do we got?

1480
02:20:26,923 --> 02:20:28,914
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1481
02:20:30,359 --> 02:20:31,826
You were good.

1482
02:20:33,663 --> 02:20:35,324
I'm going to the hotel.

1483
02:20:36,599 --> 02:20:38,590
I'm going to take a shower...

1484
02:20:39,569 --> 02:20:42,003
...and I'm going to sleep for a month.

1485
02:22:53,302 --> 02:22:54,394
Here.

1486
02:23:01,477 --> 02:23:02,444
Come on.

1487
02:23:11,187 --> 02:23:12,279
Shit.

1488
02:23:21,530 --> 02:23:23,293
Motherfucking waste.

1489
02:23:26,736 --> 02:23:29,569
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1490
02:23:29,639 --> 02:23:30,901
Not you, baby.

1491
02:23:31,007 --> 02:23:32,235
Not you.

1492
02:23:37,546 --> 02:23:40,276
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1493
02:23:40,449 --> 02:23:43,282
Lauren Gustafson,
and she's supposed to be here.

1494
02:23:50,826 --> 02:23:52,919
I need somebody to help...

1495
02:23:59,068 --> 02:24:00,126
I got you.

1496
02:24:01,504 --> 02:24:04,598
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

1497
02:24:05,107 --> 02:24:06,665
Let's get a doctor!

1498
02:24:06,742 --> 02:24:08,505
Let's go! A doctor here!

1499
02:24:08,811 --> 02:24:11,245
- There's your mama.
- Let's just calm down.

1500
02:24:11,280 --> 02:24:13,441
- Is she on any drugs?
- I'm calm. No.

1501
02:24:16,118 --> 02:24:18,609
Get a trauma surgeon
and a vascular surgeon.

1502
02:24:18,854 --> 02:24:22,346
I think she cut both arteries.
I could hardly feel her pulse.

1503
02:24:22,692 --> 02:24:24,057
Her pressure's down.

1504
02:24:24,126 --> 02:24:25,991
So is the respiration.
You have to intubate her.

1505
02:24:26,062 --> 02:24:27,324
It's ready.

1506
02:24:29,198 --> 02:24:31,223
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1507
02:24:31,334 --> 02:24:32,460
I don't know.

1508
02:24:32,535 --> 02:24:33,934
Where did you find her?

1509
02:24:34,003 --> 02:24:35,163
The bathtub.

1510
02:24:37,106 --> 02:24:39,233
Give her large-bore normal saline.

1511
02:24:39,508 --> 02:24:40,975
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1512
02:24:41,043 --> 02:24:44,410
Give me two units, O-negative.
Let's type and cross her for siX.

1513
02:24:46,382 --> 02:24:49,783
Where is respiratory? We need more help.
Get them down now.

1514
02:24:49,819 --> 02:24:52,845
Let's have X-ray ready
for post-intubation chest X-ray.

1515
02:24:59,362 --> 02:25:02,388
Your daughter's out of surgery
and she's in the recovery room.

1516
02:25:02,465 --> 02:25:03,989
Her vital signs are stable.

1517
02:25:04,066 --> 02:25:06,728
The surgeon will speak to you
in a few moments.

1518
02:25:06,836 --> 02:25:07,803
She's okay?

1519
02:25:07,903 --> 02:25:09,029
She's doing good.

1520
02:25:09,105 --> 02:25:10,629
She'll be okay.

1521
02:25:11,107 --> 02:25:13,007
She's going to be okay.

1522
02:25:13,209 --> 02:25:16,110
Oh, my baby.
Why did she do this to herself?

1523
02:25:17,546 --> 02:25:20,640
Look what she did.
Look what she did to herself.

1524
02:25:25,020 --> 02:25:27,716
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1525
02:25:28,124 --> 02:25:30,251
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1526
02:25:30,326 --> 02:25:33,124
Do you understand?
I ain't going anywhere.

1527
02:25:48,043 --> 02:25:49,010
It's me.

1528
02:25:49,645 --> 02:25:52,409
Plane's in the air now.
You're right on time.

1529
02:25:53,015 --> 02:25:54,949
I still can't find a driver...

1530
02:25:55,050 --> 02:25:56,779
...so that's in the trust.

1531
02:25:57,153 --> 02:25:58,552
One other thing...

1532
02:25:59,555 --> 02:26:01,113
...I gotta tell you.

1533
02:26:01,891 --> 02:26:05,918
The guy you want is in the Marquis
under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1534
02:26:06,295 --> 02:26:08,092
...which I figure you wouldn't.

1535
02:26:08,330 --> 02:26:09,729
You figured right.

1536
02:26:10,166 --> 02:26:11,758
So, so long, brother.

1537
02:26:13,969 --> 02:26:15,436
You take it easy.

1538
02:26:16,138 --> 02:26:17,469
You're home free.

1539
02:26:19,508 --> 02:26:20,770
Take it easy.

1540
02:26:31,787 --> 02:26:32,879
What is it?

1541
02:26:33,189 --> 02:26:34,383
Nothing.

1542
02:26:34,690 --> 02:26:35,952
Home free.

1543
02:27:14,096 --> 02:27:16,030
I gotta take care of something.

1544
02:27:16,131 --> 02:27:17,291
Is there time?

1545
02:27:18,100 --> 02:27:19,328
There's time.

1546
02:27:48,230 --> 02:27:50,892
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1547
02:28:33,142 --> 02:28:33,972
Registration.

1548
02:28:34,043 --> 02:28:35,305
This is room service.

1549
02:28:35,377 --> 02:28:39,336
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they
screwed up his room number. What is it?

1550
02:28:39,415 --> 02:28:41,246
- They're always doing that.
- I know.

1551
02:28:41,317 --> 02:28:42,579
1735.

1552
02:28:42,851 --> 02:28:44,113
Thank you.

1553
02:30:27,923 --> 02:30:29,652
Your attention, please.

1554
02:30:29,725 --> 02:30:32,091
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

1555
02:30:33,362 --> 02:30:34,829
Do not panic.

1556
02:30:35,030 --> 02:30:36,861
Do not take the elevators.

1557
02:30:42,137 --> 02:30:43,263
I'm staying here.

1558
02:30:43,338 --> 02:30:46,705
I'll check the stairs.
If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1559
02:30:51,346 --> 02:30:53,712
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1560
02:30:54,750 --> 02:30:56,980
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1561
02:30:59,021 --> 02:31:00,682
And she chose you.

1562
02:31:03,292 --> 02:31:05,123
She picked your place.

1563
02:31:07,296 --> 02:31:09,287
It's not right, what happened to her.

1564
02:31:09,364 --> 02:31:10,558
No, it's not.

1565
02:31:27,216 --> 02:31:28,979
Is there any way that...

1566
02:31:31,320 --> 02:31:33,379
...it could work out between us?

1567
02:31:36,191 --> 02:31:38,591
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1568
02:31:38,927 --> 02:31:39,985
But...

1569
02:31:40,162 --> 02:31:41,754
...in the end...

1570
02:31:46,668 --> 02:31:48,397
It's like you said:

1571
02:31:51,540 --> 02:31:52,905
All I am...

1572
02:31:53,609 --> 02:31:55,702
...is what I'm going after.

1573
02:32:03,085 --> 02:32:05,315
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1574
02:32:16,398 --> 02:32:17,956
Go on, if you have to.

1575
02:32:21,136 --> 02:32:22,296
I'll stay.

1576
02:32:22,371 --> 02:32:24,271
I'm okay. I can handle this.

1577
02:32:27,476 --> 02:32:28,943
Just be careful.

1578
02:32:29,711 --> 02:32:32,373
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1579
02:32:33,482 --> 02:32:34,449
Okay?

1580
02:33:35,277 --> 02:33:37,142
Security. There's a fire on three.

1581
02:33:37,613 --> 02:33:39,410
We have to evacuate all floors.

1582
02:33:39,481 --> 02:33:40,948
I can't leave here.

1583
02:33:49,992 --> 02:33:53,052
Why don't we just talk
about this a bit, brother?

1584
02:34:07,309 --> 02:34:08,640
He's here on 17.

1585
02:34:11,613 --> 02:34:12,841
Look at me.

1586
02:34:12,981 --> 02:34:14,073
Look at me!

1587
02:34:17,386 --> 02:34:18,478
Look at me!

1588
02:34:50,419 --> 02:34:51,886
LAPD! Don't move!

1589
02:34:51,954 --> 02:34:53,785
Put your hands on your head!

1590
02:35:29,291 --> 02:35:30,986
Switch me to TAC 5.

1591
02:35:31,760 --> 02:35:33,022
Casals...

1592
02:35:33,328 --> 02:35:34,260
JJ...

1593
02:35:35,097 --> 02:35:36,359
Drucker, JJ...

1594
02:35:36,531 --> 02:35:38,931
I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.

1595
02:35:39,001 --> 02:35:40,127
What have you got?

1596
02:35:40,235 --> 02:35:43,398
Teams are moving up the other elevators
to the 17th-floor elevators.

1597
02:35:43,438 --> 02:35:46,874
All out of commission because
of the fire alarm. People everywhere.

1598
02:35:46,975 --> 02:35:48,374
Fine. 10-4.

1599
02:38:13,355 --> 02:38:14,913
Let me have that shot.

1600
02:44:33,067 --> 02:44:35,228
Told you I'm never going back.

1601
02:44:39,340 --> 02:44:40,432
Yeah.
