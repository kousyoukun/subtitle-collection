1
00:02:41,955 --> 00:02:44,122
Yeah, you can leave her in the hallway for now.

2
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:52,089
- Stabilizing here. - Where's the portable x-ray?

3
00:03:29,127 --> 00:03:30,836
Check, charge or cash?

4
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:32,713
Cash. And, uh...

5
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:37,843
...make it out to Jack's Demolition, Tucson.

6
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:40,470
Seven eighty-eight thirty.

7
00:03:49,355 --> 00:03:50,981
Okay.

8
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,247
Hey.

9
00:05:30,415 --> 00:05:32,124
Taking me to breakfast?

10
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,875
I can't, I'm meeting Bosko.

11
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:37,087
Hey, Vincent.

12
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:39,339
- Mom, where are my barrettes? - Hi, sweetie.

13
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:42,926
- I saw them on the kitchen table. - They're not there. I already checked.

14
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:45,303
- Want me to make coffee? - No school today?

15
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,724
My dad's taking me to the new building and then to lunch.

16
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,101
Try under the cushions on the sofa.

17
00:05:54,147 --> 00:05:55,897
He's already a half an hour late.

18
00:05:56,691 --> 00:06:00,277
He gonna show? Or that son of a bitch gonna stand her up like last time?

19
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:03,071
- I'll make coffee. - I'm out of time, babe.

20
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,754
Mom, where are my barrettes? They're not in the couch.

21
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:21,381
Wear the blue ones.

22
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:24,176
I don't wanna wear the blue ones. They don't match.

23
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:27,012
- Did you check in your bathroom? - I checked everywhere.

24
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,890
- Well, what do you want me to do? - Find them.

25
00:06:30,058 --> 00:06:32,976
- Mom, pay attention. - All right, sweetie, all right. What?

26
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,103
- Daddy's gonna be here. - Okay, he's gonna...

27
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:37,189
I'm not gonna be ready. I can't be late.

28
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,524
- You won't be late. - No, I will be late.

29
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:42,652
Okay. Before Daddy comes, we can find them if we look together.

30
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,863
- It's all right, baby. It's all right. - No.

31
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,656
It's all right. It's all right.

32
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,743
We'll find them together, you and me. We'll find them together.

33
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:54,623
Just relax. He won't come before we find them. I promise you.

34
00:07:04,509 --> 00:07:06,676
Hey. Give me another refill.

35
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:10,931
Now he wants a refill.

36
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:21,942
- What's your name? - Waingro.

37
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:31,993
You're Michael, huh?

38
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:47,050
You guys always work together?

39
00:07:47,218 --> 00:07:48,885
All the time.

40
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:51,596
- Real tight crew, huh? - Real tight.

41
00:07:52,682 --> 00:07:56,560
Yeah, if this works good, I'd consider going again, you know.

42
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,229
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

43
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:13,118
- How's he doing? - A hundred percent.

44
00:08:13,286 --> 00:08:15,203
Right on schedule.

45
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:17,080
Made a right on Venice Boulevard.

46
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:22,669
- We're a mile and a half from you. - Okay.

47
00:08:44,901 --> 00:08:48,778
Just crossed over the number-one lane, 300 yards from you now.

48
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:51,364
- Get set. - I am.

49
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:52,657
Put that on.

50
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:01,625
Here we go.

51
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:05,188
Two eleven! Two eleven! We're being held up!

52
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:13,280
Two-eleven alarm. Armored car.

53
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,365
There's the call. Three minutes.

54
00:10:16,993 --> 00:10:18,618
Clear!

55
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:24,059
Eighty seconds left!

56
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:28,104
Get back. Get back.

57
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,689
Get back!

58
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:34,069
Hey, Slick, you see that shit coming out of their ears?

59
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,780
They can't fucking hear you. Cool it.

60
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,627
I got it.

61
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:52,420
Got it.

62
00:11:55,049 --> 00:11:57,175
You had to fuck with me.

63
00:11:57,343 --> 00:11:59,094
You wanna fuck with me?

64
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,994
Come on! What the fuck are you doing?

65
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:26,746
- What did you do? - I had to, man.

66
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,082
- Guy was making a move. - Let's go.

67
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:38,550
Dumb motherfucker.

68
00:13:08,539 --> 00:13:10,582
- Step back, please, sir. - I heard them.

69
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:36,191
A million six.

70
00:13:36,692 --> 00:13:39,235
Forty cents on the dollar, 640,000 to you.

71
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,779
Here's a 150 front money.

72
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:44,240
Get you the rest in two, three days.

73
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,577
Know who owned these?

74
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,082
Malibu Equity and Investments.

75
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:57,253
Roger Van Zant. Owns banks in the Caymans.

76
00:13:57,421 --> 00:14:00,924
Runs investment portfolios for offshore drug money. Stuff like that.

77
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:04,427
- So? - So you ripped off his bearer bonds.

78
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,763
He's got insurance.

79
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:09,766
That's the point. He collects 100 percent from the insurance.

80
00:14:09,934 --> 00:14:13,770
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds back from us for 60 percent of their value.

81
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:16,940
And make 40 percent on top of the 100 percent.

82
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:22,737
Sell it back to him instead of going to the street. That's an extra 320,000 to you.

83
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:24,614
Try it on him.

84
00:14:24,949 --> 00:14:27,158
- Kelso called. - About what?

85
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,911
A score he's putting out and wants you to look at.

86
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,664
What do I need his score for? I got my own.

87
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,958
Says it's clean and low eight figures.

88
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,127
- 9 a.m. tomorrow. - What happened out there?

89
00:14:39,755 --> 00:14:41,506
Don't ask.

90
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:17,375
Find the ambulance?

91
00:15:17,543 --> 00:15:21,087
- Dumped it four blocks from here. - 22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.

92
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,632
They torched it. Burned everything. The guns, clothes, everything.

93
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,010
Investigators are still working the scene...

94
00:15:27,177 --> 00:15:29,429
They were airborne. Taped the last few seconds...

95
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:31,848
...of the black-and-whites doing demolition derby.

96
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,893
Stolen out of Fresno two weeks ago.

97
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,688
Yellow pickup truck out of whittier day before yesterday.

98
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:43,818
You taking this one, lieutenant, or does it stay in Division?

99
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:47,864
This look like gangbangers working the local 7-11 to you?

100
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:50,450
- Robbery-Homicide's taking it. Yeah. - All yours.

101
00:15:50,618 --> 00:15:54,120
We got three motorists. All they saw were men with masks. They were distant.

102
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:58,207
Console TV man over there however, he was closer.

103
00:15:58,876 --> 00:16:00,335
He ID anybody?

104
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:03,546
Well, he was hiding. He heard it mostly.

105
00:16:05,257 --> 00:16:07,383
Okay. What about them?

106
00:16:07,551 --> 00:16:11,220
Right. Now, according to TV man, this guy started mouthing off.

107
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:13,765
- Smart. - Yeah, somebody called a guard "Slick".

108
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:15,391
- Slick? - Yeah.

109
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:21,064
Now, this guy... I figure this guy went for that holdout piece, ankle holster, right?

110
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,649
From here.

111
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,485
Bang. Bang. Bang, bang, bang.

112
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:27,236
To his side.

113
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:32,283
This guy here has got what appears to be a double-tap entry wound to the sternum.

114
00:16:32,451 --> 00:16:35,244
Tattooing around the head wound, scorched bone, close range.

115
00:16:35,412 --> 00:16:36,871
Probably executed.

116
00:16:38,707 --> 00:16:43,086
And it was a million six in bearer bonds, and they ignored the loose cash.

117
00:16:43,253 --> 00:16:45,963
Because they had no time, because they were on a clock.

118
00:16:46,131 --> 00:16:48,925
Which means they knew our response time to a 2-11...

119
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:52,303
...had our air, immobilized it, entered...

120
00:16:52,763 --> 00:16:54,889
...escaped in under three minutes.

121
00:16:55,057 --> 00:16:57,684
It's a good spot here. We got good escape routes.

122
00:16:57,851 --> 00:17:02,438
- Two freeways within a quarter of a mile. - Traffic video camera?

123
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:04,607
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

124
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,275
You recognize the M.O.?

125
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:09,195
M.O. is that they're good.

126
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,198
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all of them...

127
00:17:12,366 --> 00:17:15,451
...after they killed the first two guards, they didn't hesitate...

128
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,497
...popped guard number three because what difference does it make?

129
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,416
Why leave a living witness?

130
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:24,877
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock 'n' roll.

131
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,298
The shape charge.

132
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:33,219
The shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient.

133
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,304
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

134
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:39,100
So let's start looking for recent high-line burglaries that have mystified us.

135
00:17:39,518 --> 00:17:41,436
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI.

136
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:43,771
You're gonna get the phone book. Do it anyway.

137
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,941
Who's moving the bearer bonds?

138
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:50,653
Check the usual fences. You and I will check Cusamano and Torena.

139
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,532
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro. Hang in with Forensics.

140
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,493
From the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

141
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:00,580
If we're lucky, it's exotic. We can trace the sale.

142
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,417
Get your hand out of that man's pocket, Rachel.

143
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,668
Oh, Vince.

144
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,969
Want some pie?

145
00:18:24,188 --> 00:18:26,272
Gotta go to the john.

146
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:00,723
Look, I had to get it on, man. He was making a move. I had to get it on.

147
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,907
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

148
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,910
...to make up for his full end.

149
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,580
Because I wanna pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.

150
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,748
Okay.

151
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,038
Hold it!

152
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,760
Hey.

153
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:47,848
- Where's the rest? - We're late.

154
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:52,061
Ooh, you look too good to go out. I could just jump you right here.

155
00:21:55,065 --> 00:21:57,733
- Where is it? - Uh, squared the bookies, baby.

156
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:01,320
There's more in a couple days, so don't sweat it. We really are late.

157
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,615
Yeah, come on, you gotta be kidding me.

158
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:09,120
Honey, it ain't worth the risks you take for 8000.

159
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,123
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

160
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,625
Let's go. Get your coat.

161
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,047
There is no point talking to you. All you are is a child growing older.

162
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,549
What's that supposed to mean?

163
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,886
It means we're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults, living our lives.

164
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,305
I'm married to a gambling junkie who won't listen.

165
00:22:28,473 --> 00:22:30,141
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

166
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,228
What am I doing in this rat-bastard situation?

167
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:37,732
You're not! What do you want from me? Leave the bankbook and car keys...

168
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,110
...in the kitchen on your way out. Are we going, or am I going alone?

169
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,779
You could keep that other crap but Dominick would go with me.

170
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:47,491
Don't you even think about...

171
00:23:12,142 --> 00:23:14,602
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

172
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,981
- Albert Torena call Vincent? - No.

173
00:23:19,149 --> 00:23:21,484
No. Report came in.

174
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,820
The explosive was Dynex, linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

175
00:23:24,988 --> 00:23:28,991
You can pick it up with a driver's license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

176
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:33,496
- Too common to trace a sale, Vincent. - Oh, that's wonderful.

177
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,642
Are you all right?

178
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:57,353
What happened? Where you been?

179
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:58,687
Work.

180
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:02,149
Lauren's dad show up?

181
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,905
Didn't call, didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

182
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:13,244
Now, does this guy have any idea what's going on with his kid?

183
00:24:15,163 --> 00:24:16,831
I don't know.

184
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:18,874
Fucking jerk.

185
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,877
Well, is she okay?

186
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,880
She's been in her room all day.

187
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:28,217
So no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

188
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:33,639
Uh, I made dinner for us, four hours ago. Um...

189
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:38,853
Every time I try to maintain a consistent mood between us, you withdraw.

190
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:45,568
I got three dead bodies on a sidewalk off Venice Boulevard, Justine.

191
00:24:45,735 --> 00:24:47,403
I'm sorry...

192
00:24:47,571 --> 00:24:51,740
...if the goddamn chicken...

193
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:54,535
...got overcooked.

194
00:25:11,678 --> 00:25:14,555
...seven men in Denmark, to a key defendant here.

195
00:25:17,642 --> 00:25:20,269
- Did you find it? - Not yet.

196
00:25:21,104 --> 00:25:22,646
There it is.

197
00:25:24,608 --> 00:25:26,692
It's over here, somewhere.

198
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:34,617
- Interior design? - It's on the back wall.

199
00:25:50,467 --> 00:25:53,260
- Coffee, sir? - Please.

200
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,392
Will you pass the cream?

201
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:04,813
- Thanks. - What did you get?

202
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:07,900
What?

203
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:10,319
What are you reading?

204
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:16,992
Book about metals.

205
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:24,041
Stress Fractures in Titanium.

206
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:26,961
What kind of work you do?

207
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:33,342
Lady, why are you so interested in what I read or what I do?

208
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,515
I've seen you in the store from time to time.

209
00:26:39,683 --> 00:26:41,100
What store?

210
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:43,143
Hennessey + Ingalls. I work there.

211
00:26:43,311 --> 00:26:44,979
Uh...

212
00:26:45,146 --> 00:26:49,858
If you don't wanna talk to me, it's okay. I'm sorry I bothered you.

213
00:26:59,869 --> 00:27:03,747
I didn't mean to be rude. I didn't recognize you.

214
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:08,377
I work in metals. I'm a salesman. My name's Neil.

215
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,009
I'm Eady.

216
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:19,179
You like working there?

217
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:22,099
Sure.

218
00:27:22,267 --> 00:27:25,477
I get a discount and there's a whole section of books in my area.

219
00:27:25,645 --> 00:27:27,688
What area's that?

220
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:29,815
Graphic design.

221
00:27:30,233 --> 00:27:33,777
I do, um, letterheads and logotypes at night...

222
00:27:33,945 --> 00:27:36,780
...and the store's a day job till I get enough going.

223
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,991
Who do you do that for?

224
00:27:40,702 --> 00:27:43,412
Uh, a restaurant.

225
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,457
I did their menus, and, um...

226
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,878
...a small, uh, record label.

227
00:27:51,629 --> 00:27:55,632
CDs. I've done two so far.

228
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,386
You go to school for that?

229
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,971
Heh, yeah.

230
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:04,433
- Yeah, I went to Parsons. - Where's that?

231
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:05,642
New York City.

232
00:28:06,686 --> 00:28:08,145
How long you been out here?

233
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:11,273
About a year.

234
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,776
You like it?

235
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:17,988
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

236
00:28:25,288 --> 00:28:27,373
- Live in this neighborhood? - Ah, no...

237
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,459
...I live, um, kind of above Sunset Plaza.

238
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:34,129
It's actually kind of... It's a little house that I rent.

239
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:38,801
And it's just kind of run-down, but a beautiful, beautiful view.

240
00:28:39,469 --> 00:28:40,552
What about you?

241
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,306
- I live up here. - That's very funny.

242
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:50,687
So where's your family from originally?

243
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,147
Um...

244
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,900
I'm Scotch-Irish.

245
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:01,532
They, um, emigrated to Appalachia in the late 1700s.

246
00:29:02,367 --> 00:29:04,159
Where are you from?

247
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,495
The Bay Area.

248
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:09,289
Are your folks there?

249
00:29:11,501 --> 00:29:16,004
Uh, my mother died a long time ago, and my father, I don't know where he is.

250
00:29:16,172 --> 00:29:17,714
Got a brother somewhere.

251
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,014
You have a tight family. I can tell.

252
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:28,016
- Yep. - Right?

253
00:29:28,184 --> 00:29:30,018
You're right.

254
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,735
Yeah...

255
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,488
City of lights.

256
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:50,456
In Fiji, they have these iridescent algae. They come out once a year in the water.

257
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,417
That's what it looks like out there.

258
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:56,420
You been there?

259
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,881
No, I'm going there someday.

260
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:01,341
Oh, yeah?

261
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,183
You travel a lot?

262
00:30:12,479 --> 00:30:15,314
- Yeah. - Traveling makes you lonely?

263
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,615
I... I'm alone. I am not lonely.

264
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,492
You?

265
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,411
I get lonely.

266
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,579
Albert!

267
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,541
- Shit. - Albert.

268
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,668
Vincent, what you doing coming here, man?

269
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,211
You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

270
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:48,008
You were supposed to get back to me last night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

271
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:52,262
- I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know. - Let's violate his ass right now.

272
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,558
I do for you, you don't do for me, is that it?

273
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,561
Vincent, man, I swear, I was out all night, man.

274
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,064
I'm hitting like one of them flamingo-matador guys.

275
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,358
Flamingo? That's got nothing to do with me.

276
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,944
I was cutting it real smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you.

277
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,489
- I'm a dancer, man. You know. - Bullshit.

278
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:13,075
I paged your ass all day. I can't stand paging.

279
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,827
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.

280
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,914
Where is your empathy, brother? It's a substance-abuse problem.

281
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,374
Empathy was yesterday.

282
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,501
Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

283
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,836
- Vincent, man, look... - Did you fall in love?

284
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,423
Come on. Did you fall in love last night and you went off somewhere?

285
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,926
- Vincent... - Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.

286
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,762
- I'll buy that. - Vincent.

287
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,055
Give me all you got!

288
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,224
- Vincent... - Give me all you got!

289
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,228
I swear, man, my brother, man. My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.

290
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,105
I heard "Richard"?

291
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,399
- He's gonna talk to you. - Richard?

292
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,900
- Richard. - Richard.

293
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:50,112
- He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight. - He's not here, is he?

294
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,615
- No, he's gonna meet you tonight. - Tonight? What happened to now?

295
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,577
I... I... I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.

296
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,871
- This is a bunch of bullshit. - No, no, I swear.

297
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,749
He said no because he in Phoenix.

298
00:34:02,917 --> 00:34:04,770
- Ahh. - But this, man, I swear... I swear, man.

299
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,378
By the time I get to Phoenix,

300
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,131
He'll be risin',

301
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:13,385
He'll probably leave a note right on the door

302
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,762
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

303
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:22,060
You know? He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...

304
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,563
...at 2 a.m. Be there.

305
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,148
You be there too.

306
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,192
Vincent, I can't be there, man. I got things to do, Vincent.

307
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,821
- I got things to do, places to be. I got... - Hey, hey, hey.

308
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:35,157
Be there.

309
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,874
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

310
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,879
What is it?

311
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,673
It's a bank.

312
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:55,135
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...

313
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,345
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

314
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,682
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.

315
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,518
- On the prowl or strong? - Strong. Through the front door.

316
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,520
How many guys?

317
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,690
Four, or three plus a driver. Walk in, knock them over, walk out.

318
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,233
And you want a 100,000 advance...

319
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,694
...against a 10-percent cut for that?

320
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,156
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score. They hit the holdup alarms...

321
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,034
...I gotta get out before the cops show. What is that?

322
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,578
They hit three holdup alarm systems.

323
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:23,872
Two telco and a cellular.

324
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,668
See, but the signals aren't going anywhere because...

325
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:34,674
See, the night before, you cut in and trick out the alarm-system computer...

326
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:40,430
...to turn itself and the video recorders off 20 minutes before you walk in the door.

327
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,141
Architectural, electrical-engineering plans?

328
00:35:43,309 --> 00:35:47,562
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards already built. They go straight into the CPU.

329
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,565
What's the estimate?

330
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:56,530
12.1, 12.2 million.

331
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,534
You're on.

332
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,744
Congratulations.

333
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:06,873
And to give you a little idea of where my estimates come from, this is a printout...

334
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,459
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

335
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:13,129
Be that as it may, my way you get 100 percent from the insurance company...

336
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,966
...and take the bonds from us at 60 cents on the dollar...

337
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,218
...and make yourself another 40 percent.

338
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,764
Your operation doesn't skip a beat. Everybody makes out.

339
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:25,433
Sure, you got a deal.

340
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:29,312
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

341
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,108
Yeah, so you have your man call me and we'll set the meet.

342
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,651
Yeah, okay.

343
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:36,486
Nice talking to you.

344
00:36:37,572 --> 00:36:39,114
You gonna deal with these guys?

345
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:42,284
So word's out on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.

346
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,120
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

347
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,582
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Islands' offshore.

348
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:56,047
That's not really an estimate. Those are exact figures.

349
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,509
I have a printout of the, uh, cash flow of the bank for the past two months.

350
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:02,304
- How'd you get this information? - Just comes to you.

351
00:37:02,471 --> 00:37:04,306
This stuff just flies through the air.

352
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,475
They send information out and it's beamed out all over the place.

353
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,979
All you have to do is know how to grab it. See, I know how to grab it.

354
00:37:16,569 --> 00:37:20,947
Um... Okay, here we go. Thirteen-point-nine million.

355
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,577
- I bought it. - Good.

356
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,537
What did I tell you?

357
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:32,417
Here.

358
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:36,838
We're on. Call Van Zant, collect the money.

359
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,926
- How is he? - He's a businessman.

360
00:37:42,261 --> 00:37:43,887
Okay.

361
00:38:10,581 --> 00:38:13,249
- Avocado. - Avocado.

362
00:38:15,544 --> 00:38:17,420
- Hello? - Yeah, hello.

363
00:38:18,547 --> 00:38:19,881
Chris is at my place.

364
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:26,680
- What's wrong? - Husband-and-wife stuff.

365
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,724
I'll let him sleep it off here.

366
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,281
What happened to you?

367
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:53,081
- When you gonna get some furniture? - When I get around to it.

368
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:57,794
Charlene's gonna leave me.

369
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:01,339
Why?

370
00:39:04,051 --> 00:39:06,094
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

371
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,347
With everything we've been doing?

372
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,351
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

373
00:39:13,728 --> 00:39:17,939
- When you gonna get an old lady? - When I get around to it.

374
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,985
You got something else on the side?

375
00:39:23,779 --> 00:39:24,946
Nothing regular.

376
00:39:25,906 --> 00:39:27,949
She got something else on the side?

377
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,451
- No. - You sure?

378
00:39:30,703 --> 00:39:32,620
Yeah, I'm sure.

379
00:39:34,415 --> 00:39:36,499
I don't know what you're doing.

380
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,878
Remember Jimmy MacAwain on the yard used to say:

381
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,963
You wanna be making moves on the street?

382
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,133
Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life...

383
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,719
...that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat...

384
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,346
...if you spot the heat around the corner.

385
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:52,057
Remember that?

386
00:39:58,689 --> 00:40:01,816
For me, the sun rises and sets with her, man.

387
00:40:03,152 --> 00:40:04,235
Yeah?

388
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,946
Yeah.

389
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,784
Okay.

390
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,999
Today we take delivery of cash from Van Zant...

391
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:21,211
...then I drop our deposit on Kelso for this bank.

392
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,670
Bank? What bank?

393
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:25,840
What about the platinum thing? It's ready to fall.

394
00:40:26,008 --> 00:40:28,009
That goes too, then the bank.

395
00:40:32,056 --> 00:40:34,766
- You want some breakfast? - Yeah.

396
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:42,690
Are you okay?

397
00:40:42,858 --> 00:40:44,943
Yeah, sugar.

398
00:40:49,865 --> 00:40:51,366
Yeah.

399
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,784
- For real. - Okay.

400
00:40:52,952 --> 00:40:53,993
Gonna do good.

401
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:56,204
I'll see you later.

402
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:14,514
You Solenko? I'm Don Breedan.

403
00:41:14,682 --> 00:41:18,810
Grierson, my parole officer, told me to come by here and see if you had a job for me.

404
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:22,897
- You're familiar with this kind of operation? - Yeah, man. I'm a great grill man.

405
00:41:23,065 --> 00:41:26,401
Good. Good for you. Here, you'll mop the toilets, hit the dishwasher...

406
00:41:26,569 --> 00:41:28,570
...bus tables and empty the garbage too.

407
00:41:28,737 --> 00:41:31,656
Give me a hard time, I'll report you loaded, drunk or stealing.

408
00:41:31,824 --> 00:41:34,409
And I will violate you back so fast your head will spin.

409
00:41:34,577 --> 00:41:37,078
Twenty-five percent of your take-home kicks back to me.

410
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:40,748
Rules of the game. Call Grierson, check it out.

411
00:41:40,916 --> 00:41:42,834
Change in the back.

412
00:41:48,007 --> 00:41:50,258
Well, what are you waiting for?

413
00:42:09,069 --> 00:42:11,029
Malibu Equity and Investments.

414
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:14,199
- Yeah, Roger Van Zant. - Please hold.

415
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:20,163
Yeah, this is Roger Van Zant.

416
00:42:20,331 --> 00:42:21,873
I'm supposed to collect something.

417
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:26,294
Give me your number, and somebody will call you right back from a different line.

418
00:42:26,670 --> 00:42:30,465
818-133-6089.

419
00:42:54,031 --> 00:42:55,073
Yep.

420
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,991
I got a package for you.

421
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:59,202
There's a drive-in on Centinela. 02:30 tomorrow.

422
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,913
Okay, just send one man, alone.

423
00:43:26,981 --> 00:43:28,773
- Who was that guy? - Nobody.

424
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:31,526
Who the...? Who...? Who was that guy?

425
00:43:31,694 --> 00:43:34,195
- He's nobody. - I gotta know who he is. Who is he?

426
00:43:34,363 --> 00:43:35,863
- He's nobody, Neil. - Listen, you...

427
00:43:36,031 --> 00:43:38,533
He's a legit liquor wholesaler from Las Vegas.

428
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:41,369
- Alan Marciano. - Chris is gonna straighten it up with you.

429
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:44,330
- It's too late. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it! - Shut up!

430
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,835
Here's the deal. You'll give Chris one last shot.

431
00:43:49,003 --> 00:43:53,214
After that, he fucks up, then I will finance setting you up myself...

432
00:43:53,382 --> 00:43:55,466
...on my own, anywhere you want.

433
00:43:55,634 --> 00:43:58,636
Dominick will go with you. And my word counts.

434
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:02,974
But right now, you will give him the chance.

435
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:11,649
Clean up. Go home.

436
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:58,279
Give me all your money.

437
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,740
One day you gonna get smoked with that shit.

438
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:02,075
Ain't gonna be you, fool.

439
00:45:05,454 --> 00:45:08,081
- He's coming in alone. Send him through. - Yeah, got it.

440
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:40,196
Vincent, hey, man.

441
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:45,159
Vincent. This is my brother, Richard. Richard, Vincent.

442
00:45:45,327 --> 00:45:47,745
- Richard. - Yo, it's all right.

443
00:45:48,122 --> 00:45:50,123
What have you got for me?

444
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,166
Before we even get into that...

445
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:56,504
...there's this crew ripping rides all along the beach areas, all right?

446
00:45:56,672 --> 00:45:59,048
Now, the back of a trim shop on Irvine...

447
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:02,301
...if somebody was to pay a little visit this weekend...

448
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:06,347
...they might find two Turbos and a 911 Slope.

449
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:09,183
You're looking to rid yourself of your competition.

450
00:46:09,351 --> 00:46:12,103
Eh, I'm a good citizen.

451
00:46:12,271 --> 00:46:16,023
I'm Donald Duck. So you got something to tell me or what?

452
00:46:17,651 --> 00:46:20,069
Check this out, coz.

453
00:46:20,237 --> 00:46:23,865
How do I know if I tell you what you need to know...

454
00:46:24,032 --> 00:46:26,534
...you're gonna do what the fuck I need to get done?

455
00:46:26,702 --> 00:46:30,455
Richard, man, Hanna is straight up, man. We do business all the time.

456
00:46:30,622 --> 00:46:32,915
I ain't your coz, you rat motherfucker.

457
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:38,713
And you know because I say so after I hear what the fuck you gotta tell me.

458
00:46:38,881 --> 00:46:41,299
Look here, man. You understand what I'm saying?

459
00:46:41,467 --> 00:46:43,468
I can get killed for telling you this shit.

460
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,761
Or you're gonna get killed walking your doggie.

461
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:47,763
All right.

462
00:46:47,931 --> 00:46:50,224
There's this cat I was locked up with in Folsom.

463
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:54,645
Did a couple, two, three years. He got out and I ran into him.

464
00:46:57,608 --> 00:46:59,108
And so?

465
00:46:59,276 --> 00:47:01,694
He's a big fiend for action.

466
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:05,364
Now, if he'd have said nothing, I'd have thought nothing...

467
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:09,243
...but he goes on and on, running down to me how he ain't been doing nothing...

468
00:47:09,411 --> 00:47:12,079
...and nothing's been going on, and all this bullshit.

469
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:18,252
So right then and there I know this cat's got something going down.

470
00:47:24,843 --> 00:47:26,719
Pretty fucking great.

471
00:47:28,388 --> 00:47:30,765
Albert, what's wrong with you?

472
00:47:31,308 --> 00:47:34,644
You drag me here, waste my time like this.

473
00:47:34,811 --> 00:47:37,980
You saw a guy on the street who's an ex-con?

474
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:42,902
- That's right. - Well, I am over-fucking-whelmed.

475
00:47:43,070 --> 00:47:45,446
What do you want for that, a Junior G-man badge?

476
00:47:45,614 --> 00:47:47,949
You gonna make the call on them Porsches or what?

477
00:47:49,243 --> 00:47:50,284
Is he kidding me?

478
00:47:52,204 --> 00:47:54,914
I'm telling you, this Slick is no joke.

479
00:47:55,082 --> 00:47:56,582
You know what I'm saying?

480
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,501
- Say what? Say what? - What?

481
00:47:58,669 --> 00:48:03,589
- You said, "Slick". What does that mean? - Slick. That's what he calls people, "Slick".

482
00:48:04,716 --> 00:48:07,051
And tell me about him.

483
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:12,682
About 6 feet tall, lot of jailhouse tats.

484
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,142
Got a big-ass peacock right here.

485
00:48:17,479 --> 00:48:19,438
What's his name?

486
00:48:20,023 --> 00:48:21,816
Cheritto.

487
00:48:21,984 --> 00:48:24,986
Michael Cheritto.

488
00:48:27,990 --> 00:48:30,491
33 busts since 1976.

489
00:48:30,659 --> 00:48:33,160
Eleven for armed robbery, three convictions.

490
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:37,123
Two out of a three-to-five-year beef in Attica. Three years in Marion.

491
00:48:37,291 --> 00:48:40,751
Five years in Folsom off a knock-back to involuntary manslaughter.

492
00:48:40,919 --> 00:48:42,753
- Jacket's 2 inches thick. - Okay.

493
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:45,840
- Who do I have there now? - Drucker and me, boss. And Schwartz.

494
00:48:46,008 --> 00:48:47,842
Tell SIS I want full surveillance.

495
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:50,845
That's 24 hours. Round the clock, day and night.

496
00:48:51,013 --> 00:48:55,099
We never close. Open seven days a week. Bug the car, the house, the work.

497
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,351
When he moves or sits, like in a restaurant...

498
00:48:57,519 --> 00:48:59,812
...I want pictures of who he moves and sits with.

499
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:03,858
Then run makes on them. They got jackets, I wanna see who they move and sit with.

500
00:49:04,026 --> 00:49:06,527
I want it up and running by tomorrow night.

501
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,085
- Put your hands where I can see them. - What?

502
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:07,254
- Put your hands where I can see them. - All right.

503
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:11,050
I tell you what to do, I tell you how to do it.

504
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:15,763
Now, with your right hand only, your right hand only...

505
00:50:16,765 --> 00:50:19,433
...take the package and throw it in here.

506
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:38,953
Fuck. Behind you. On the right.

507
00:51:58,742 --> 00:52:00,618
Yeah, Roger Van Zant?

508
00:52:00,786 --> 00:52:03,746
- Yeah, who's this? - You know who this is.

509
00:52:04,748 --> 00:52:06,290
Yes, I do. Yes, I do.

510
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:11,045
I sent a guy to deliver the package. He didn't call. Is everything right?

511
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:14,340
Tell you what, forget the money.

512
00:52:14,674 --> 00:52:18,385
- What? - Forget the money.

513
00:52:19,221 --> 00:52:20,262
Wh...

514
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:24,517
It's a lot of money. What are you doing? What do you mean, forget the money?

515
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:27,561
What am I doing? I'm talking to an empty telephone...

516
00:52:28,355 --> 00:52:29,396
I don't understand.

517
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:33,234
...because there is a dead man on the other end of this fucking line.

518
00:52:53,088 --> 00:52:54,755
Oh, my.

519
00:52:54,923 --> 00:52:57,258
- Do you like it? - Look at my ring.

520
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,844
Wow.

521
00:53:02,931 --> 00:53:05,766
Did you know about this? It's so beautiful.

522
00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,601
You are insane.

523
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:13,732
Do you like it?

524
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,776
- It's beautiful. - Yeah, it's pretty good.

525
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:19,280
- Just don't ask him where he got it. - Yeah, that's right.

526
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,998
What do you wanna be when you grow up, honey?

527
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,375
I don't know.

528
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,547
She doesn't know. Just like me. I don't know either.

529
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:52,479
Hello?

530
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,565
Hi, it's me.

531
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:58,485
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

532
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:02,573
I've been busy. Can I see you?

533
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:07,745
I was afraid that was just the one night, you know?

534
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:10,831
No, not for me, it wasn't.

535
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,919
Yeah, me neither.

536
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,339
Can I fall by?

537
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:22,676
- Yeah. - Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

538
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:34,855
Thank you.

539
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,358
Good night.

540
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,902
Goddamn convention.

541
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,155
- Which one's Slick? - The wide one.

542
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:44,531
Got two transmitters.

543
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:47,743
One's in the wheel well, backup's in the firewall.

544
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:49,370
Okay, get ready.

545
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,747
- Did you say good night to Neil? - Good night.

546
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:55,542
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis. SIS has got a revolving tail...

547
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,503
...and hung a wire on the house phone.

548
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:03,050
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals depository three times.

549
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:06,095
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

550
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:09,223
Sammy and I think that's gonna be their next score.

551
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:11,392
Who's the loner?

552
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,398
First time we're seeing him. We're not on him yet.

553
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,068
Well, get on it.

554
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,328
Okay.

555
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:44,550
When these guys walk out the door of whatever score they're gonna take next...

556
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:48,595
...they're gonna have the surprise of a lifetime.

557
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:06,363
Hey, baby. Time to go.

558
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,533
I showed you a good time, didn't I?

559
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,744
Oh, yeah.

560
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:16,206
You fly. You cool.

561
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:27,551
You're lying to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.

562
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:31,722
Mm, I ain't lying. You a hot dog.

563
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,475
A regular rodeo rider.

564
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:38,020
And this was the monster fuck of my young life.

565
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,735
Now I got to get my ass street side, sugar.

566
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:47,196
You don't have a truth-telling style.

567
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:51,909
- What are you talking about? - You don't know what this is.

568
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,876
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

569
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,979
Where you been?

570
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,191
SHU at Pelican Bay.

571
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,735
New Folsom, B-wing.

572
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:31,115
I am a cowboy looking for anything heavy.

573
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,992
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

574
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,537
That is why I am here.

575
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,795
Why don't you...?

576
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:48,507
Why don't you call this guy?

577
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:51,343
This guy's always putting guys on.

578
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,223
Thank you, brother.

579
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:59,977
- I'll buy you a drink? - Buy me a drink.

580
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:07,234
- What's so funny? - Nothing.

581
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:10,612
- It's really dumb. - Something smells negligent.

582
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,699
You two are perfect for each other. How did you meet?

583
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:20,539
I knew this guy in, uh, grade school.

584
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,875
He was named Raoul, uh... Whatever.

585
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,712
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers and fold them over, one over the other.

586
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,839
Then he'd turn his eyelids inside out...

587
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:33,010
I can't keep my hands off you, and that's the truth.

588
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:38,515
That's what's so wonderful about you, in that bestial sort of way.

589
00:58:42,604 --> 00:58:44,229
Woman.

590
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,613
This better be earth-shattering.

591
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,662
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.

592
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,873
- Raoul. - To Raoul.

593
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05,209
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

594
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:49,378
Here's how we found her.

595
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:55,676
- How old? - Sixteen, seventeen.

596
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,886
Been here about six hours.

597
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,513
How'd she die, Rachel?

598
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:03,100
Beat her head in, same as the others. Cerebral hematoma.

599
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,062
Who's that?

600
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:10,315
- Mother and siblings, I guess. - What the hell they doing here?

601
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:14,194
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.

602
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,530
Okay, let's go.

603
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,411
That's nice.

604
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,748
When I run a DNA check on the semen, my intuition says it's coming up the same guy.

605
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,127
So it's a series, and ending up in your court.

606
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:33,422
- Sheriff's Homicide getting anywhere? - Not yet.

607
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:36,425
- Get her. - Get off me. Get off me.

608
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,093
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

609
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:40,762
- Oh, my God. - Hold it, hold it.

610
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:48,312
- Where is she? - Easy, easy, easy.

611
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:52,774
Please. Please, come on.

612
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:58,488
- It's okay. It's okay. - Who did this?

613
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:01,700
Where's my baby? Where is she?

614
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:05,245
I need to know what happened.

615
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,247
I guess the Earth shattered.

616
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:53,251
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

617
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:58,131
I didn't wanna ruin their night too. What was it?

618
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,676
You don't wanna know.

619
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:04,179
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look.

620
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:07,808
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go. Come on.

621
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:11,686
You never told me I'd be excluded.

622
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:17,150
I told you when we hooked up, baby, that you were gonna have to share me...

623
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:21,071
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.

624
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,659
And I bought into that sharing because I love you.

625
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:31,748
I love you fat, bald, money, no money, driving a bus. I don't care.

626
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:35,127
But you have got to be present like a normal guy some of the time.

627
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,838
That's sharing. This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

628
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:41,007
Oh, I see. What I should do is come home and say:

629
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:45,053
Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...

630
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:48,974
...where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...

631
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:52,769
...because it was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.

632
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,772
Come on, let's share that, and in sharing it...

633
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:01,945
...we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit, right?

634
01:03:04,574 --> 01:03:06,950
Wrong. You know why?

635
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:09,286
Because you prefer the normal routine.

636
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,663
We fuck, then you lose the power of speech.

637
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:14,374
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

638
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:18,336
I preserve it, because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

639
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:21,923
Where I gotta be.

640
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,765
You don't live with me.

641
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:36,188
You live among the remains of dead people.

642
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:40,817
You read the terrain.

643
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:45,322
You search for signs of passing...

644
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,532
...for the scent of your prey...

645
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,493
...and then you hunt them down.

646
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:54,706
That's the only thing you're committed to.

647
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,795
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.

648
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:09,387
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.

649
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,155
Hey. Miss Lillian.

650
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:30,909
Let's go, baby.

651
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:37,207
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

652
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,544
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.

653
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:45,131
Baby, can you just handle it till we find you something new?

654
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,467
Can you do that?

655
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:52,514
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.

656
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,814
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

657
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:04,317
Because I'm proud of you.

658
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,951
You're proud of me?

659
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,957
What the hell you proud of me for?

660
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,918
Come on home.

661
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:35,682
- What were you doing there? - I was skiing.

662
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,059
I was trying to ski.

663
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,605
That's what people do there. You go skiing...

664
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,107
...and you meet people.

665
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:45,775
You try to have a good time.

666
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,611
- Did you have a good time? - No.

667
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:48,903
Why not?

668
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:51,406
I'm not good at meeting people.

669
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:53,491
You met me.

670
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,578
Well, that happened without my thinking about it.

671
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:59,247
Which is why, probably.

672
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:01,958
No, it's because you were fine.

673
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,545
Eady.

674
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:09,257
Take off with me for a while.

675
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,510
- Where? - New Zealand.

676
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:15,930
When?

677
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,476
I have to go separate, but you could meet me there.

678
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:21,645
But my job, my...

679
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:26,650
I got money. You don't need money. You could set up a studio, do work there.

680
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:29,653
- I don't know. - What's there to know?

681
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,780
Are you married?

682
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,449
- What? - You come and go...

683
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:36,242
The last thing I am is married.

684
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:39,454
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way, a double blank.

685
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,456
Then, all of a sudden...

686
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:44,668
...someone like you comes along.

687
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,840
- You don't know me, Neil. - I know enough.

688
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,388
Come with me.

689
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,816
What's wrong, baby?

690
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:12,278
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?

691
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,368
Yeah.

692
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:23,248
Good.

693
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,816
- Hey, sweetie. - Hi.

694
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:53,194
What happened? You forget your mom was picking you up?

695
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:56,156
No.

696
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,534
So, what's going on?

697
01:08:00,953 --> 01:08:03,246
I felt like being alone.

698
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:07,876
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.

699
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:16,384
- Hey, Mike. - Hey, Lauren.

700
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:05,600
What's happening?

701
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:08,603
Lieutenant. Sir.

702
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:11,397
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

703
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:14,567
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

704
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,960
Jackson's a...

705
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:10,456
Technique.

706
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,895
Open sesame. Right there.

707
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:31,162
There he goes.

708
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:34,976
- We walk. - I'm right there.

709
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:37,145
We walk! Now! Come on.

710
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,575
He's heard it.

711
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:52,994
He's heard it.

712
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,087
Heads up.

713
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:05,882
- One's coming out. - Hold it, captain.

714
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,677
- Vincent, he's not carrying anything. - Yeah, I see.

715
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,058
- Here we go. - Not till my boss says so.

716
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,727
Vincent, both of them are not carrying anything.

717
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,571
- Okay, let them go. - What do you mean?

718
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:29,781
We can take them...

719
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:32,033
What are you gonna take them on? Breaking and entry?

720
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:34,285
They didn't steal anything. Don't you get it?

721
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:36,704
It gets knocked back to some misdemeanor...

722
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:39,373
...they do six months and they're out. No fucking way.

723
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,668
I'm not taking the heat from my boss. They're not walking.

724
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:46,506
That's exactly what they're gonna do. They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

725
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:49,050
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.

726
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:53,346
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck.

727
01:14:38,392 --> 01:14:40,476
Back to work.

728
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:45,606
L.A.P.D. Gee, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?

729
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:47,441
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

730
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:51,070
The place, not us. Because it's been hit a couple of times, you know.

731
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,906
Assume they got our phones, assume they got our houses...

732
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:56,576
...assume they got us right here, right now as we sit.

733
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,703
Everything. Assume it all.

734
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:00,955
How we gonna buy the bank package from Kelso?

735
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:04,292
- I'll front that. That's not a problem. - What happens to Van Zant?

736
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:08,462
With the heat we got, do you wanna play World War II in the streets with Van Zant?

737
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,548
No, I want my 750. And he gets a pass?

738
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:15,052
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

739
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,638
Our problem is, take the bank or split right now?

740
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:20,308
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

741
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:23,644
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways.

742
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:25,062
That's it.

743
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,814
Chris.

744
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:32,153
The bank is worth the risk.

745
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:34,322
I need it, brother.

746
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:39,160
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.

747
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,757
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever. Whatever.

748
01:15:52,925 --> 01:15:56,385
No, not on this one, Michael. On this one, you're on your own.

749
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:11,359
You figure this is the best thing to do?

750
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:13,361
This is the best thing to do?

751
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:17,782
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for me the reward is maybe worth the stretch.

752
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,868
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.

753
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:22,536
You got T-bonds, real estate.

754
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:26,082
If I were you, I would be smart. I would cut loose of this.

755
01:16:44,518 --> 01:16:48,229
Well, you know, for me, the action is the juice.

756
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:49,438
I'm in.

757
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:54,944
You too?

758
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:56,862
Yeah, sure.

759
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,698
Let's go.

760
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,741
Fuck them, let's do it.

761
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:03,494
All right, let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

762
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,843
- You can't go in there. - Watch this.

763
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:21,178
- Excuse me. That... - Tim, I gotta call you back.

764
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:22,805
You have to have an appointment.

765
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,807
- Can I help you? - Are you Alan Marciano?

766
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:27,435
- Yeah, and who the fuck are you? - Who am I?

767
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:30,688
- Hey. Hey. - Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

768
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:34,108
L.A.? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.

769
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:37,778
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck you guys think you're pushing around...

770
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:43,284
- ...but I know people here, okay? - Las Vegas P.D. takes you into custody.

771
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,912
You are extradited to Newark on a New Jersey warrant...

772
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,333
...for smuggling cigarettes up from North Carolina three years ago...

773
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,668
...or you go to work for us.

774
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:54,628
Cut and dried.

775
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:57,631
- That is it. - Oh, shit.

776
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:00,551
Charlene Shiherlis.

777
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,470
- Who? - Who?

778
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,805
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?

779
01:18:05,182 --> 01:18:08,809
The lady you been talking dirty to on the telephone every day the last week.

780
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:11,228
Yeah, you know what? You can't tie me to her.

781
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:15,316
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jack off.

782
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:19,362
Oh, man, I just... Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?

783
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:22,239
Because she got a great ass!

784
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,911
And you got your head all the way up it.

785
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:28,496
Jesus.

786
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:34,668
When I think of asses, a woman's ass...

787
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:37,171
...something comes out of me.

788
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,591
- So? - So no big thing.

789
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:45,888
All I want is her husband and his whole fucking crew.

790
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:48,349
Now, you're gonna work with Sergeant Drucker here.

791
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:55,606
San Clemente Road and Hermosa.

792
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:58,442
That's where we cut through the fence. That's the access.

793
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,735
Right.

794
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:02,738
The security systems around here are a joke.

795
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:10,037
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge, that's Escape Route Number 1.

796
01:19:10,956 --> 01:19:14,208
Number 2, over here, Anaheim to the 110.

797
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,709
- Good. - Okay?

798
01:19:15,877 --> 01:19:18,587
- Yeah. That's fine. - Got it? Good. Let's go.

799
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,571
They were looking back...

800
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:46,073
...in this direction.

801
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:48,242
A container facility?

802
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:52,955
- For a cartage theft? - Too visible. Too lowball for them.

803
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:59,086
Next door's an oil refinery, over there's a scrap yard.

804
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:03,757
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around. Same for the scrap yard.

805
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:09,472
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

806
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:15,936
A refinery and a scrap yard.

807
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:19,940
- What the hell is going on? - That's what we're trying to figure out.

808
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,943
We thought we had it.

809
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:24,778
Thought we had it.

810
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:39,001
I got an idea of what they were looking at.

811
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,216
- You wanna know what they're looking at? - What?

812
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:50,012
I mean, is this guy something, or is he something?

813
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:54,058
This crew is good.

814
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:57,394
You know what they were looking at?

815
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:58,979
What?

816
01:21:00,232 --> 01:21:01,899
Us.

817
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,818
The L.A.P.D.

818
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,363
The police department.

819
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,157
We just got made.

820
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:19,375
Yeah.

821
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,343
Okay.

822
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:39,562
Okay, motherfucker!

823
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:01,834
Kelso come through?

824
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:05,212
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

825
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:14,054
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

826
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:18,601
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards. Hanna's all over you.

827
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:21,729
He's on all the work cars. Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

828
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:24,231
Not yours, they've been losing you at night.

829
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,485
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school. Marine Corps.

830
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,779
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide, Major Crime Unit.

831
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:34,241
He's taken down some heavy crews. Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

832
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,660
And he was a fucking maniac.

833
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:41,081
He was working Narcotics before that. Had some problems, divorced twice.

834
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:44,251
Current wife's Justine. He's why the extra heat.

835
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:48,422
The Vice sergeant...

836
01:22:49,466 --> 01:22:51,759
...says Hanna likes you.

837
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:55,846
Thinks you're some kind of star. You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

838
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,974
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

839
01:23:00,852 --> 01:23:02,936
Funny as a heart attack, man. Three marriages.

840
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:06,398
What the fuck do you think that means? He likes staying home?

841
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:09,276
Means the man is one of those guys out there...

842
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:12,363
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

843
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:16,867
With this guy and this much heat, you should pass.

844
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,626
It's worth the stretch.

845
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:31,465
This guy can hit and miss. You can't miss once.

846
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,634
You sure?

847
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,969
I'm sure.

848
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,643
Let's go to the garage.

849
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:58,158
Justine.

850
01:24:03,498 --> 01:24:05,457
Justine?

851
01:24:11,339 --> 01:24:13,132
Where we going?

852
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:21,223
- Okay, where are you going? - Out.

853
01:25:19,574 --> 01:25:22,576
- What are you on? - TAC 9.

854
01:25:23,997 --> 01:25:28,257
They're northbound out LAX on the 405. We got four ground units.

855
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,311
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18. Who have I got?

856
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:53,232
Hey, Vincent, it's JJ. I'm in Air 40. Richard Glover's with me.

857
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:57,569
It's on the 105 eastbound approaching the 110 interchange.

858
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,616
- You running a revolving tail? - Yeah, I got two units in front, three behind.

859
01:26:02,784 --> 01:26:06,829
Okay, have one of them pick me up at the Vermont on-ramp.

860
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:08,413
Let's go.

861
01:26:58,423 --> 01:27:02,384
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I close or far, or what?

862
01:27:02,552 --> 01:27:05,137
Three hundred yards, center lane.

863
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:13,580
How you doing?

864
01:28:16,751 --> 01:28:19,795
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

865
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:29,221
- Yeah, sure. Let's go. - Follow me.

866
01:28:44,988 --> 01:28:47,447
Seven years in Folsom.

867
01:28:47,615 --> 01:28:49,449
In the hole for three.

868
01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:50,909
McNeil before that.

869
01:28:54,497 --> 01:28:56,832
McNeil as tough as they say?

870
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,584
You looking to become a penologist?

871
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,200
You're looking to go back?

872
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,600
You know, I chase down some crews guys just looking to fuck up,

873
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,552
get busted back. That you?

874
01:29:09,262 --> 01:29:11,471
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

875
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:14,474
I worked all kinds.

876
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:20,022
You see me doing thrill-seeking liquor-store holdups...

877
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:22,524
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

878
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:25,527
- No, I do not. - Right.

879
01:29:26,696 --> 01:29:28,530
I am never going back.

880
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:32,409
Then don't take down scores.

881
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:36,204
I do what I do best, I take scores.

882
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:40,000
You do what you do best, trying to stop guys like me.

883
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:46,048
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

884
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:49,217
What the fuck is that? Barbecues and ball games?

885
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,095
Yeah.

886
01:29:54,557 --> 01:29:59,770
- This regular-type life like your life? - My life? No, my life...

887
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,689
No, my life's a disaster zone.

888
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:07,277
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

889
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:10,530
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.

890
01:30:10,698 --> 01:30:14,576
I got a wife. We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage...

891
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:16,620
...my third...

892
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:21,708
...because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.

893
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:23,919
That's my life.

894
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:31,968
A guy told me one time:

895
01:30:33,387 --> 01:30:35,514
Don't let yourself get attached to anything...

896
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:38,391
...you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat...

897
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:40,727
...if you feel the heat around the corner.

898
01:30:41,771 --> 01:30:45,190
Now, if you're on me, and you gotta move when I move...

899
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:48,527
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

900
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:52,572
Well, that's an interesting point.

901
01:30:53,783 --> 01:30:55,951
What are you, a monk?

902
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:57,911
I have a woman.

903
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:00,080
What do you tell her?

904
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:04,042
I tell her I'm a salesman.

905
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:13,927
So then, if you spot me coming around that corner...

906
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:17,097
...you're just gonna walk out on this woman?

907
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,058
Not say goodbye?

908
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:22,561
That's the discipline.

909
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,688
That's pretty vacant, no?

910
01:31:24,856 --> 01:31:26,523
Yeah, it is what it is.

911
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:29,317
It's that, or we both better go do something else, pal.

912
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,238
I don't know how to do anything else.

913
01:31:33,823 --> 01:31:35,699
Neither do I.

914
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:41,621
- I don't much want to either. - Neither do I.

915
01:31:49,297 --> 01:31:52,883
You know, I have this recurring dream.

916
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:56,511
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

917
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:00,557
...and all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting at this table...

918
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:04,978
...and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...

919
01:32:05,146 --> 01:32:10,150
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.

920
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:13,987
And there they are, these big balloon people...

921
01:32:14,155 --> 01:32:17,240
...because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.

922
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:20,911
The neighbors reported the smell...

923
01:32:21,454 --> 01:32:25,457
...and there they are, all of them just sitting there.

924
01:32:27,168 --> 01:32:28,210
What do they say?

925
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:31,671
Nothing.

926
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:33,506
- No talk? - None.

927
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:37,302
Just... They don't have anything to say.

928
01:32:37,929 --> 01:32:40,347
See, we just look at each other.

929
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:45,644
They look at me. And that's it, that's the dream.

930
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,398
I have one where I'm drowning.

931
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:54,236
And I gotta wake myself up and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

932
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:57,822
You know what that's about?

933
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:01,034
Yeah. Having enough time.

934
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:07,791
- Enough time to do what you wanna do? - That's right.

935
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:13,380
- You doing it now? - No, not yet.

936
01:33:18,261 --> 01:33:20,553
You know, we're sitting here...

937
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:23,723
...you and I, like a couple of regular fellows.

938
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:26,601
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

939
01:33:28,896 --> 01:33:31,898
And now that we've been face to face...

940
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:39,197
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it.

941
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:40,699
But I'll tell you...

942
01:33:43,244 --> 01:33:46,746
...if it's between you and some poor bastard...

943
01:33:46,914 --> 01:33:49,416
...whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

944
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:54,587
...brother, you are going down.

945
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:09,144
There's a flip side to that coin.

946
01:34:10,938 --> 01:34:15,275
What if you do got me boxed in and I gotta put you down?

947
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:21,281
Because no matter what, you will not get in my way.

948
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:24,909
We've been face to face, yeah...

949
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:31,624
...but I will not hesitate. Not for a second.

950
01:34:37,465 --> 01:34:39,799
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

951
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:44,763
Or who knows?

952
01:34:44,972 --> 01:34:47,724
Or maybe we'll never see each other again.

953
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,783
They dumped us.

954
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,410
What?

955
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:10,872
- They dumped us. - What do you mean, they dumped us?

956
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,123
Chris slipped his tail.

957
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:14,876
He doesn't talk about scores with Charlene...

958
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:17,629
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I tried.

959
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:20,048
- What about Cheritto? - Same.

960
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:22,967
Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

961
01:35:25,388 --> 01:35:29,849
- They dumped all our surveillance? - Yeah, at the same time. 9 p.m.

962
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:34,187
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

963
01:35:34,355 --> 01:35:36,689
We were on you. Then McCauley drives into LAX...

964
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:39,859
...where surveillance can't fly over because of flight paths.

965
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:43,363
His car's still there. He's gone.

966
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:53,748
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

967
01:36:52,391 --> 01:36:54,100
You hear from him yet?

968
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:58,730
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more. Where's this guy?

969
01:37:00,816 --> 01:37:05,528
This guy here. We put him on. Says he knows McCauley.

970
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:11,743
Who are you?

971
01:37:12,995 --> 01:37:16,789
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

972
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:20,543
I've been living in this office day and night. How well do you know him?

973
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:24,797
Oh, we took some major scores together.

974
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,802
How come I haven't heard from him?

975
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:33,806
Well, he's probably busy right now, but he's real thorough.

976
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:39,103
- He ain't gonna forget about you. - Oh, that's reassuring.

977
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:44,025
Well, I got some moves I could make here.

978
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:47,487
Probably be a big help to you.

979
01:38:08,509 --> 01:38:09,842
You recognize the grill man?

980
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:22,313
- No. - Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

981
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:27,527
- Ain't got my break yet, man. - Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

982
01:38:27,695 --> 01:38:30,697
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

983
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:32,824
Take your break later.

984
01:38:32,992 --> 01:38:36,327
Piece of shit. Pick up.

985
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:40,832
Where the hell is he?

986
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,335
- I wanted to check the slot for a work car. - So did I.

987
01:38:49,508 --> 01:38:50,925
Yeah?

988
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:53,636
Hang on.

989
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:55,930
- Yeah. - Hey.

990
01:38:56,098 --> 01:39:00,643
Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.

991
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,061
All right.

992
01:39:12,948 --> 01:39:15,074
- Where are you? - There's cops all over me, man.

993
01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:19,245
They're on me like a cheap suit. I can't dump them.

994
01:39:21,749 --> 01:39:25,710
- After the fact you spotted them? - No, no. They're doing parallels.

995
01:39:28,589 --> 01:39:30,006
I can try to dump them again.

996
01:39:30,174 --> 01:39:34,552
How are we gonna know if you did? If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

997
01:39:34,928 --> 01:39:36,846
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

998
01:39:37,014 --> 01:39:41,100
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man. Last thing I wanna do is let you down.

999
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:05,708
Come on, man.

1000
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:08,920
Pick up.

1001
01:40:09,672 --> 01:40:12,715
- Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up? - What's up, brother?

1002
01:40:12,883 --> 01:40:15,259
Man, what you doing here?

1003
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:19,180
What I am doing is I'm looking for a driver who can handle scanners and a radio.

1004
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:20,390
Right now, today.

1005
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:21,974
You remember the drill?

1006
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:23,518
Yeah, man, sure.

1007
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,019
You cool?

1008
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:27,647
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.

1009
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:31,150
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

1010
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:47,375
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1011
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:50,837
Out back in five.

1012
01:40:59,847 --> 01:41:02,473
- What's burning? What's burning? - Nothing I'm doing.

1013
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:04,350
What is this?

1014
01:41:04,518 --> 01:41:06,686
Where do you think you're going?

1015
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:13,901
Just came across a first edition of Kandinsky's Theory of Color.

1016
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:16,320
Yeah. No, it's in good condition.

1017
01:41:16,488 --> 01:41:19,824
And it will not stop or answer radio communication.

1018
01:41:19,992 --> 01:41:23,369
The 180-foot vessel is called Jin Yin Number 1...

1019
01:41:23,537 --> 01:41:26,539
...and is suspected of smuggling Chinese illegal aliens.

1020
01:41:26,707 --> 01:41:28,708
It was spotted Saturday by patrol aircraft.

1021
01:42:41,114 --> 01:42:43,574
- Stay down. - Don't move! Don't fucking move!

1022
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:47,119
Put your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air! Put them up!

1023
01:42:47,287 --> 01:42:50,289
Down, down! Get on your knees.

1024
01:42:50,457 --> 01:42:52,291
- Give me the keys. - Get on your knees.

1025
01:42:52,459 --> 01:42:54,252
Get on your knees!

1026
01:42:57,256 --> 01:43:00,967
Hey. Hey! Get over there. Get the fuck... Get down.

1027
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:03,636
Turn around! Put your hands behind you. Behind you!

1028
01:43:03,804 --> 01:43:05,763
Get down! Stay down!

1029
01:43:06,682 --> 01:43:09,684
Get down! Get down! Down, you stupid son of a...

1030
01:43:10,686 --> 01:43:13,813
- Down! Down, now! - Keys! Keys! Keys!

1031
01:43:17,484 --> 01:43:18,818
All of you stay down.

1032
01:43:19,987 --> 01:43:23,322
We want to hurt no one. We're here for the bank's money, not your money.

1033
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:25,992
Your money's insured. You're not gonna lose a dime.

1034
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:29,996
Think of your families. Don't risk your life. Don't try and be a hero.

1035
01:43:30,163 --> 01:43:33,666
Right now I want you to sit on the floor and put your hands on your head.

1036
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:38,337
Anybody feels sick, anybody got heart trouble, go ahead and lean against the wall.

1037
01:43:39,172 --> 01:43:41,716
- Give me the key. - What key?

1038
01:43:43,343 --> 01:43:46,387
Get down and stay down!

1039
01:43:46,555 --> 01:43:49,181
Sit there. Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1040
01:43:58,483 --> 01:44:00,192
Get down!

1041
01:44:25,552 --> 01:44:26,677
Hey. Hey!

1042
01:44:34,978 --> 01:44:37,271
Put your head down.

1043
01:44:38,357 --> 01:44:40,691
- Look at me again, I'll kill you. - Stay down. Down.

1044
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:45,196
- Put your head down! - Get down. Get down.

1045
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:07,551
- Hey, Casals. - Yeah.

1046
01:45:07,719 --> 01:45:10,096
You guys working a case on a Neil McCauley?

1047
01:45:10,263 --> 01:45:14,558
This CI, Hugh Benny, called in about a bank they're looking at or something.

1048
01:45:14,768 --> 01:45:15,935
Vincent.

1049
01:45:16,561 --> 01:45:19,605
Far East National Bank, 11:30!

1050
01:45:36,999 --> 01:45:39,208
I want a block at Figueroa and 5th...

1051
01:45:39,376 --> 01:45:43,254
...and I want a block northbound Flower at 6th.

1052
01:46:20,792 --> 01:46:22,334
They're already coming out.

1053
01:46:23,086 --> 01:46:27,089
Okay, we're gonna have to take them in the car. Wait till they are all in.

1054
01:46:27,257 --> 01:46:29,633
Get clean shots. Watch your background.

1055
01:46:39,061 --> 01:46:40,519
- Police! Move! - What's going on?

1056
01:46:42,022 --> 01:46:43,689
Move. Move. Get down.

1057
01:46:47,986 --> 01:46:49,028
Look out.

1058
01:47:01,875 --> 01:47:03,918
- Move it, come on. - L.A.P.D. Get down.

1059
01:47:05,545 --> 01:47:06,879
Move it. Down, down, down.

1060
01:47:10,133 --> 01:47:12,218
We did it, right, Neil? Huh?

1061
01:47:15,847 --> 01:47:17,515
Move!

1062
01:47:23,271 --> 01:47:24,897
Get down.

1063
01:47:32,531 --> 01:47:33,531
Fuck. Fuck!

1064
01:47:33,698 --> 01:47:35,199
In the car!

1065
01:47:52,217 --> 01:47:53,717
Go! Go! Go!

1066
01:48:16,491 --> 01:48:18,909
- Son of a bitch! - Go, go!

1067
01:48:53,904 --> 01:48:54,904
Go!

1068
01:50:07,352 --> 01:50:09,061
Go!

1069
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:04,700
Come on. Come on.

1070
01:51:10,165 --> 01:51:12,333
Get him out of here.

1071
01:51:36,107 --> 01:51:38,192
Get down! Now!

1072
01:51:40,779 --> 01:51:42,363
Shit.

1073
01:51:47,494 --> 01:51:49,328
Shit.

1074
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:55,000
Out of the way! Down! Out of the way! Get them down! Now, now!

1075
01:51:55,168 --> 01:51:57,378
No, out of the way. Out of the way.

1076
01:52:46,553 --> 01:52:49,179
Mommy? Mommy!

1077
01:52:54,727 --> 01:52:56,478
Come here, honey.

1078
01:53:38,062 --> 01:53:39,104
Come on, honey.

1079
01:53:41,691 --> 01:53:45,819
I got you. It's okay now.

1080
01:53:47,071 --> 01:53:51,867
Tragedy in a Southland neighborhood today. A bank robbery spilled out into the street.

1081
01:53:52,035 --> 01:53:55,204
Claudia Newman, live on the scene. She has the latest. Claudia?

1082
01:53:55,371 --> 01:53:59,124
This afternoon, this neighborhood was terrorized by a bank holdup gone wrong.

1083
01:53:59,292 --> 01:54:03,128
With the streets full of mid-day shoppers and kids, police and armed robbers...

1084
01:54:03,296 --> 01:54:05,964
- Excuse me, bartender? - One minute, lady.

1085
01:54:06,132 --> 01:54:08,675
...robbery, pursuit and, finally, death.

1086
01:54:08,843 --> 01:54:11,970
A Los Angeles neighborhood is shaken by a bank robbery...

1087
01:54:12,138 --> 01:54:14,723
...that ended in homicide and terror.

1088
01:54:14,891 --> 01:54:18,727
One suspect, Michael Cheritto, is one of four men involved in the foiled robbery.

1089
01:54:18,895 --> 01:54:21,146
- He died at the scene. - What can I get you, miss?

1090
01:54:21,314 --> 01:54:23,649
Also fatally wounded, suspect Donald Breedan...

1091
01:54:23,816 --> 01:54:25,317
Miss?

1092
01:54:25,485 --> 01:54:29,321
...during the extensive gunfire between police and suspects.

1093
01:54:31,115 --> 01:54:32,866
All right, hold him. Hold him.

1094
01:54:33,034 --> 01:54:34,634
- All right. All right. - It's all right.

1095
01:54:42,710 --> 01:54:45,337
- So? - Well, he's got blood loss and shock.

1096
01:54:45,505 --> 01:54:50,050
I'm gonna give you quarter-grain morphine for the pain. Subcutaneous injection.

1097
01:54:50,218 --> 01:54:51,927
Bottom line.

1098
01:54:52,095 --> 01:54:56,181
It's mostly tissue damage, which is good, but his clavicle's fractured.

1099
01:54:56,349 --> 01:54:59,268
- Can he rest for a while? - Six, seven hours.

1100
01:54:59,435 --> 01:55:01,228
- That's it? - That's it.

1101
01:55:01,396 --> 01:55:03,647
- Take off your shirt. - What?

1102
01:55:05,567 --> 01:55:07,526
Take off your shirt.

1103
01:55:13,866 --> 01:55:16,952
My... Look, my daughter gave it to me for Father's Day.

1104
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,038
I don't give a shit who gave it to you. Take it off.

1105
01:55:25,503 --> 01:55:27,879
Chris. Hey.

1106
01:55:29,966 --> 01:55:32,676
Chris, listen to me.

1107
01:55:33,177 --> 01:55:37,055
Nate's gonna pick you up. He's gonna take you to his place.

1108
01:55:38,558 --> 01:55:41,059
- Where's Charlene? - We gotta get out of here.

1109
01:55:41,227 --> 01:55:43,020
We're all over the 6:00 news.

1110
01:55:43,187 --> 01:55:46,523
- We gotta get out of here. - I'm not going without her.

1111
01:55:46,691 --> 01:55:50,068
Think about that. I will meet you at Nate's.

1112
01:55:50,236 --> 01:55:51,361
Where are you going?

1113
01:55:51,529 --> 01:55:55,824
I gotta find out if our out got spilled along with every other damn thing.

1114
01:55:56,075 --> 01:55:57,743
Who did it?

1115
01:55:58,578 --> 01:56:00,120
Who wasn't there?

1116
01:56:01,122 --> 01:56:02,956
Trejo.

1117
01:56:06,419 --> 01:56:07,586
I'll see you at Nate's.

1118
01:56:14,385 --> 01:56:16,803
- Yeah. - Yeah. You still want me?

1119
01:56:18,139 --> 01:56:22,225
You come down here right now and you get me. Dominick and me. Okay?

1120
01:56:22,393 --> 01:56:26,271
Okay, baby, okay. I'll be there in two hours, all right?

1121
01:56:26,439 --> 01:56:28,690
- Okay? - All right.

1122
01:56:30,276 --> 01:56:33,820
Goddamn you, Chris. Goddamn you.

1123
01:56:34,322 --> 01:56:38,241
- You're on a plane for Los Angeles. - Great.

1124
01:57:25,998 --> 01:57:28,208
Why'd you do it? What happened?

1125
01:57:29,711 --> 01:57:31,420
- They made me. - Who?

1126
01:57:31,587 --> 01:57:33,338
Where's Anna?

1127
01:57:33,840 --> 01:57:34,881
She's dead.

1128
01:57:38,094 --> 01:57:41,179
So is Michael and Breedan, the guy who stood in for you.

1129
01:57:41,681 --> 01:57:45,851
- Who did it? Who did it? - They had Anna, man.

1130
01:57:46,018 --> 01:57:47,769
Who had her?

1131
01:57:48,521 --> 01:57:52,149
Waingro.

1132
01:57:52,400 --> 01:57:53,525
On his own?

1133
01:57:55,361 --> 01:57:57,738
- For someone. - Who?

1134
01:57:57,905 --> 01:58:00,240
The other he worked for.

1135
01:58:02,160 --> 01:58:04,077
Zant.

1136
01:58:06,247 --> 01:58:09,624
- Van Zant? - Yeah.

1137
01:58:09,792 --> 01:58:11,626
Van Zant.

1138
01:58:11,794 --> 01:58:14,880
- Are you sure? - Van Zant.

1139
01:58:16,758 --> 01:58:19,551
Did you say anything about how we're getting out?

1140
01:58:20,178 --> 01:58:23,221
- I don't think so, Neil. - Come on.

1141
01:58:25,183 --> 01:58:26,808
I don't remember, Neil.

1142
01:58:32,315 --> 01:58:36,026
- I'll call a medic. - I'm not gonna make it.

1143
01:58:37,528 --> 01:58:40,572
I can't feel nothing.

1144
01:58:41,949 --> 01:58:44,868
My Anna's gone.

1145
01:58:46,037 --> 01:58:48,288
She's gone.

1146
01:58:49,707 --> 01:58:54,002
Don't leave me like this, Neil. Please, holmes.

1147
01:58:55,338 --> 01:58:58,048
Don't leave me like this.

1148
01:59:21,405 --> 01:59:23,615
- Yeah? - Nate.

1149
01:59:24,242 --> 01:59:26,910
You on a cellular? Use a hard line.

1150
01:59:27,537 --> 01:59:28,703
It's a new one.

1151
01:59:30,248 --> 01:59:33,041
The guy lives on Hillside Terrace, Encino.

1152
01:59:33,209 --> 01:59:36,545
- 10725. - 10725, okay.

1153
01:59:36,712 --> 01:59:39,923
- Chris? - He's with me, at my place.

1154
01:59:40,091 --> 01:59:42,425
Next, Waingro, okay?

1155
01:59:44,554 --> 01:59:45,637
You got the time?

1156
01:59:46,681 --> 01:59:49,975
I'll make time, and I need a new out laid on.

1157
01:59:50,852 --> 01:59:52,102
How do you know it's blown?

1158
01:59:53,771 --> 01:59:55,897
How can I trust it?

1159
01:59:58,568 --> 02:00:00,443
Okay, you got it.

1160
02:00:00,611 --> 02:00:02,654
Stay healthy.

1161
02:00:07,743 --> 02:00:09,619
Charlene Shiherlis.

1162
02:00:10,371 --> 02:00:13,164
Drucker's got a safe house in Venice to stash her in.

1163
02:00:13,332 --> 02:00:16,543
Our Neil's transportation. When we're done here, get on the phone.

1164
02:00:16,711 --> 02:00:19,254
Somewhere, someone's trying to put it together for him.

1165
02:00:19,422 --> 02:00:21,798
You don't believe McCauley already had a getaway?

1166
02:00:21,966 --> 02:00:26,344
Sure he did. Now he needs another one. Would you trust yours after this afternoon?

1167
02:00:27,388 --> 02:00:29,723
This rat motherfucker, where did we get him?

1168
02:00:29,891 --> 02:00:33,435
He's a CI for a burglary cop. Called in the tip on the bank.

1169
02:00:33,603 --> 02:00:37,147
On Neil McCauley, how much time we got?

1170
02:00:37,315 --> 02:00:40,692
Eight, 10 hours for him to set up a new out. After that, he's gone.

1171
02:00:40,860 --> 02:00:42,819
Bye-bye. Bam.

1172
02:01:35,665 --> 02:01:40,085
You ratted McCauley to us. How'd you know? Who told you?

1173
02:01:40,252 --> 02:01:42,879
Who told you, you rat motherfucker?

1174
02:01:43,047 --> 02:01:44,673
Who?

1175
02:02:12,576 --> 02:02:15,954
Connelly back in for Murphy. Murphy with Leggat right there with him.

1176
02:02:16,122 --> 02:02:17,914
Murphy tees it up behind the net...

1177
02:02:22,086 --> 02:02:25,296
...Miller out front. Now here's Murphy with the referee...

1178
02:02:28,884 --> 02:02:30,051
Waingro, where is he?

1179
02:02:31,429 --> 02:02:33,680
- Where is he? - How the hell would I know?

1180
02:02:59,457 --> 02:03:03,376
Well, what do we have here, hmm?

1181
02:03:03,836 --> 02:03:07,464
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty.

1182
02:03:09,925 --> 02:03:12,969
- You slimy piece of shit. - You told me you wanted out from under.

1183
02:03:13,137 --> 02:03:16,306
You're scared to death, right? You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1184
02:03:16,474 --> 02:03:20,143
- Yeah, what's your end? - I... You stupid broad.

1185
02:03:20,311 --> 02:03:22,771
- How'd I get into this? - Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

1186
02:03:22,938 --> 02:03:24,147
You heard me.

1187
02:03:24,315 --> 02:03:27,358
She had a rough ride. Why don't you fix her a drink or something?

1188
02:03:27,526 --> 02:03:30,528
- Look in the cabinet above the sink. - Fuck her.

1189
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:36,076
- You'd better get in there and stay in there. - All right, all right.

1190
02:03:38,829 --> 02:03:41,081
Well, lookie here.

1191
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:44,542
My name is Sergeant Drucker, L.A.P.D. Homicide.

1192
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:48,713
- You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom? - He stays with me.

1193
02:03:49,215 --> 02:03:51,132
There we go.

1194
02:03:58,724 --> 02:04:00,683
So, what now?

1195
02:04:02,937 --> 02:04:06,689
Well, he's right, because you want out, this is out.

1196
02:04:08,109 --> 02:04:11,986
- You believe you have to betray Chris. - No shit.

1197
02:04:12,154 --> 02:04:15,115
That's right. You would have to.

1198
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:19,536
See, if you don't betray Chris, you victimize Dominick.

1199
02:04:20,037 --> 02:04:23,248
Because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...

1200
02:04:23,415 --> 02:04:25,875
...because you got no living parents to take him.

1201
02:04:26,043 --> 02:04:30,421
So he ends up state-raised in foster homes, juvenile facilities.

1202
02:04:30,589 --> 02:04:32,841
Then he steals a car.

1203
02:04:33,092 --> 02:04:38,263
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.

1204
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:41,724
Fucked for life.

1205
02:04:41,892 --> 02:04:45,228
You know what happens, because you've been there.

1206
02:04:46,397 --> 02:04:51,568
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life, but Chris did.

1207
02:04:52,653 --> 02:04:56,239
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1208
02:04:56,407 --> 02:05:00,326
You can do it for your kid, so you can raise him.

1209
02:05:04,498 --> 02:05:07,876
- What else are you selling? - All kinds of shit.

1210
02:05:08,752 --> 02:05:13,965
But I don't have to sell this and you know it, because this kind of shit here sells itself.

1211
02:05:20,264 --> 02:05:22,265
Okay, Danny, here's an update.

1212
02:05:22,433 --> 02:05:25,768
- Drucker's on Line 2. - Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1213
02:05:27,938 --> 02:05:30,064
Lieutenant, I have Drucker on the other line.

1214
02:05:30,232 --> 02:05:31,608
Oh, well, conference him in.

1215
02:05:33,110 --> 02:05:36,821
- Go ahead. - Vincent, it's me.

1216
02:05:38,741 --> 02:05:41,367
I want an answer. What's it gonna be?

1217
02:05:47,958 --> 02:05:50,460
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1218
02:05:50,628 --> 02:05:53,796
Okay, that's good. Here's the deal here.

1219
02:05:53,964 --> 02:05:59,802
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life and become a born-again good citizen.

1220
02:05:59,970 --> 02:06:04,515
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.

1221
02:06:04,683 --> 02:06:07,435
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew...

1222
02:06:07,603 --> 02:06:11,189
...then he went to work for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1223
02:06:11,357 --> 02:06:17,153
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1224
02:06:17,488 --> 02:06:20,823
Now, if Neil goes after anybody else, it's gonna be Waingro.

1225
02:06:20,991 --> 02:06:24,327
Waingro just got himself a suite at the airport Marquis...

1226
02:06:24,495 --> 02:06:27,872
...under the name "Jameson". He's there now.

1227
02:06:28,040 --> 02:06:31,125
I want you to get that to bail bondsmen, bookies...

1228
02:06:31,293 --> 02:06:34,504
...assignment officers and snitches in County.

1229
02:06:34,672 --> 02:06:37,048
Anyone you can think of who'll put it on the street.

1230
02:06:37,216 --> 02:06:41,386
Deploy a team at the hotel and personally check their come every 30 minutes.

1231
02:06:41,553 --> 02:06:45,640
Because maybe Neil will go for him. Okay? How you feeling?

1232
02:06:46,350 --> 02:06:49,602
- Banged up, but I'll live. - Okay.

1233
02:06:56,986 --> 02:06:58,861
He's here.

1234
02:06:59,154 --> 02:07:01,364
Neil is still here.

1235
02:07:01,907 --> 02:07:03,866
I can feel it.

1236
02:07:04,118 --> 02:07:06,661
But for how long?

1237
02:07:07,246 --> 02:07:10,164
Seven, eight hours, max.

1238
02:07:18,549 --> 02:07:19,882
What did you do?

1239
02:07:20,592 --> 02:07:24,304
- That was you? - It's what I don't do, I don't sell metal.

1240
02:07:24,471 --> 02:07:27,390
Would have been okay, you fly out after. Now it's jammed.

1241
02:07:27,558 --> 02:07:31,561
- Now we gotta go together. - Those other people were with you?

1242
02:07:33,689 --> 02:07:35,815
My friend, Michael...

1243
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:39,527
...he knew the risks. He didn't have to be there.

1244
02:07:43,532 --> 02:07:46,159
It rains, you get wet.

1245
02:07:48,203 --> 02:07:49,412
Get packed and let's go.

1246
02:07:56,587 --> 02:07:59,255
Eady.

1247
02:08:09,016 --> 02:08:12,268
Why did you do this to me?

1248
02:08:17,775 --> 02:08:19,817
Who are you?

1249
02:08:22,654 --> 02:08:25,782
It's gonna be all right. You understand? It'll be all right.

1250
02:08:30,662 --> 02:08:32,789
It's gonna be all right.

1251
02:08:33,791 --> 02:08:35,416
Right.

1252
02:08:44,009 --> 02:08:47,637
There's this Camaro at this address, Level D, Slot 18.

1253
02:08:52,351 --> 02:08:54,394
Here's some cash.

1254
02:08:56,980 --> 02:08:58,147
When's it over?

1255
02:09:01,652 --> 02:09:03,194
22 hours from now.

1256
02:09:03,654 --> 02:09:07,365
- Then we get out of here clean. - When will you let me leave?

1257
02:09:11,286 --> 02:09:14,163
Go now. You want out? There's the door.

1258
02:09:14,832 --> 02:09:16,999
Will you let me leave later?

1259
02:09:22,089 --> 02:09:24,298
It will be different.

1260
02:09:25,342 --> 02:09:27,510
Do you understand?

1261
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,542
It's ready.

1262
02:09:59,710 --> 02:10:01,544
Vincent.

1263
02:10:06,967 --> 02:10:09,135
This is my friend Ralph.

1264
02:10:09,303 --> 02:10:11,262
You didn't tell me you were...

1265
02:10:12,347 --> 02:10:15,224
- Oh, my God. - Where's Lauren?

1266
02:10:15,392 --> 02:10:18,603
- She's at Lisa-Beth's. - Look, this has nothing to do with me.

1267
02:10:18,770 --> 02:10:22,690
- I didn't know. I'm terribly sorry. - What are you sorry about? Sit down.

1268
02:10:23,358 --> 02:10:25,401
Don't you even get angry?

1269
02:10:25,569 --> 02:10:28,070
I'm angry, yeah.

1270
02:10:28,238 --> 02:10:30,656
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1271
02:10:30,824 --> 02:10:33,910
You know, you can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1272
02:10:35,496 --> 02:10:38,581
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1273
02:10:39,917 --> 02:10:42,210
In her ex-husband's...

1274
02:10:42,377 --> 02:10:47,423
...dead-tech, post-modernistic, bullshit house, if you want to...

1275
02:10:49,259 --> 02:10:55,598
...but you do not get to watch my fucking television set!

1276
02:10:55,766 --> 02:10:57,266
For God's sake.

1277
02:11:03,815 --> 02:11:05,608
Put the television set down.

1278
02:11:05,776 --> 02:11:08,319
- I never cheated on you, bitch. - Maybe you should have.

1279
02:11:08,487 --> 02:11:10,780
- I should have? - In a way, you're a party to this.

1280
02:11:10,948 --> 02:11:13,991
Oh, yeah. I made Ralph fuck you because it makes me feel good.

1281
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:15,326
Our situation is absurd.

1282
02:11:17,037 --> 02:11:21,874
- Look, maybe I should... - Shut up, Ralph. Sit down!

1283
02:11:23,961 --> 02:11:27,880
Why is it that I have to figure things out and explain them to you? What do you do?

1284
02:11:28,048 --> 02:11:31,884
- I say what I mean, and I do what I say. - Mm, how admirable.

1285
02:11:32,052 --> 02:11:34,136
- You bet. - Except none of it's about us.

1286
02:11:34,972 --> 02:11:36,013
No.

1287
02:11:37,474 --> 02:11:41,060
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac...

1288
02:11:41,228 --> 02:11:43,854
...but you've been walking through our life dead.

1289
02:11:44,022 --> 02:11:48,693
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1290
02:12:01,248 --> 02:12:03,499
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1291
02:12:04,167 --> 02:12:09,005
The plane, charter terminal, LAX, Hangar 17.

1292
02:12:09,172 --> 02:12:10,923
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1293
02:12:14,303 --> 02:12:18,014
Touches down, holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1294
02:12:18,181 --> 02:12:21,684
The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed a flight plan, the works.

1295
02:12:23,687 --> 02:12:26,022
- Hey, where's Chris? - He's gone.

1296
02:12:27,482 --> 02:12:28,524
What?

1297
02:12:29,151 --> 02:12:31,694
Said he's going on his own. Went to look for Charlene.

1298
02:12:31,862 --> 02:12:34,697
- Didn't you bring him here? - Yeah, I brought him here.

1299
02:12:35,157 --> 02:12:36,991
What happened?

1300
02:12:37,159 --> 02:12:39,535
It's a free country, brother.

1301
02:12:43,957 --> 02:12:48,377
Check in with me at 9. Everything's still cool.

1302
02:12:49,713 --> 02:12:51,380
All right.

1303
02:13:13,945 --> 02:13:16,906
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

1304
02:13:19,785 --> 02:13:21,994
I know life is short.

1305
02:13:22,245 --> 02:13:24,872
Whatever time you get is luck.

1306
02:13:27,084 --> 02:13:29,168
You wanna walk?

1307
02:13:31,421 --> 02:13:33,714
You walk right now.

1308
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,926
Or on your own...

1309
02:13:37,094 --> 02:13:40,137
On your own, you choose to come with me.

1310
02:13:46,228 --> 02:13:48,270
All I know is...

1311
02:13:50,065 --> 02:13:54,402
All I know is there's no point in me going anywhere anymore...

1312
02:13:54,945 --> 02:13:57,029
...if it's gonna be alone...

1313
02:13:57,948 --> 02:13:59,740
...without you.

1314
02:14:06,581 --> 02:14:08,165
Eady.

1315
02:14:57,883 --> 02:15:00,342
- Yeah. - Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1316
02:15:01,052 --> 02:15:02,678
Okay, I'll hold.

1317
02:15:05,348 --> 02:15:06,724
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1318
02:15:07,851 --> 02:15:09,685
- Yeah, do it. - Shut up!

1319
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:16,650
Now, just one second at the window...

1320
02:15:17,444 --> 02:15:19,195
...and it's all over.

1321
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:10,848
Hey, man.

1322
02:17:11,099 --> 02:17:13,058
- Yeah? - You know any, uh...

1323
02:17:13,226 --> 02:17:16,020
...place to rent around here?

1324
02:17:17,105 --> 02:17:18,230
Yeah.

1325
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:20,983
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue got cards on the wall.

1326
02:17:21,151 --> 02:17:22,192
Yeah, thanks.

1327
02:17:33,413 --> 02:17:36,081
It's not him. It's not Chris.

1328
02:17:43,757 --> 02:17:45,883
Unit 2, this is Command.

1329
02:17:46,051 --> 02:17:48,719
Take him at the street and check him out.

1330
02:17:48,887 --> 02:17:50,387
10-4.

1331
02:18:13,828 --> 02:18:15,788
- Sergeant? - Yeah.

1332
02:18:15,956 --> 02:18:18,540
This guy's John Peterson. Valid ID.

1333
02:18:18,708 --> 02:18:22,461
Car's registered to the last name Bukowski, first name Gene.

1334
02:18:22,629 --> 02:18:25,506
Ran it to DMV. It's clean.

1335
02:18:28,218 --> 02:18:31,053
- Let him go. - Roger.

1336
02:18:31,221 --> 02:18:33,555
Thank you very much. Have a good evening.

1337
02:18:35,308 --> 02:18:37,267
It's a no-go, Vince.

1338
02:18:46,361 --> 02:18:49,154
Would you like a cup of coffee while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

1339
02:18:49,322 --> 02:18:51,407
Yeah, that'd be nice.

1340
02:19:21,396 --> 02:19:23,397
- Yeah? - Yeah, what do you got?

1341
02:19:23,565 --> 02:19:25,649
Nothing's happening.

1342
02:19:36,953 --> 02:19:40,289
- Yeah? - Hello, it's Vincent.

1343
02:19:40,457 --> 02:19:41,457
What do you got?

1344
02:19:41,624 --> 02:19:45,961
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice. That's it.

1345
02:19:54,304 --> 02:19:56,138
You know what?

1346
02:19:58,141 --> 02:20:00,184
Neil is gone.

1347
02:20:02,395 --> 02:20:04,021
Bam!

1348
02:20:04,606 --> 02:20:08,025
- Flying like a bird. - Come on, Vincent, how do you know?

1349
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:13,363
- We still got bait. Maybe some time! - Got, got. What do we got?

1350
02:20:13,531 --> 02:20:15,365
What do we got?

1351
02:20:15,784 --> 02:20:18,452
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1352
02:20:19,162 --> 02:20:21,371
You were good.

1353
02:20:22,457 --> 02:20:23,999
I'm going to the hotel.

1354
02:20:25,418 --> 02:20:27,878
I'm gonna take a shower.

1355
02:20:28,463 --> 02:20:31,965
Gonna sleep for a month.

1356
02:22:41,888 --> 02:22:43,680
Over here.

1357
02:22:50,355 --> 02:22:52,272
Come on, baby.

1358
02:22:54,234 --> 02:22:56,526
Okay, okay.

1359
02:22:59,989 --> 02:23:01,949
Shit.

1360
02:23:02,825 --> 02:23:04,826
Let me tighten this.

1361
02:23:10,333 --> 02:23:12,334
What a fucking waste.

1362
02:23:12,502 --> 02:23:14,836
Okay, here.

1363
02:23:15,672 --> 02:23:21,385
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day. Not you, baby. Not you.

1364
02:23:26,224 --> 02:23:29,685
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren, Lauren Gustafson.

1365
02:23:29,852 --> 02:23:32,104
I'm supposed to be here with her. But the police...

1366
02:23:39,028 --> 02:23:42,197
- Help me. I need somebody to help... - It's okay.

1367
02:23:43,658 --> 02:23:45,242
I got you.

1368
02:23:47,870 --> 02:23:49,037
I got you, baby.

1369
02:23:50,373 --> 02:23:53,709
It'll be all right, honey. I swear. It's okay, baby.

1370
02:23:53,876 --> 02:23:57,921
Let's get a doctor! Let's go! A doctor here! There's your mama.

1371
02:23:58,089 --> 02:23:59,965
- Let's just calm down. - Your mama's here.

1372
02:24:00,133 --> 02:24:01,967
- Is she on any drugs? - No.

1373
02:24:04,887 --> 02:24:07,681
I want you to get a trauma surgeon and a vascular surgeon.

1374
02:24:07,849 --> 02:24:11,101
I think she cut both arteries. Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.

1375
02:24:11,269 --> 02:24:14,604
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration. You have to intubate her.

1376
02:24:14,772 --> 02:24:16,481
It's ready.

1377
02:24:17,984 --> 02:24:21,153
- When's the last time anybody saw her? - I don't know.

1378
02:24:21,321 --> 02:24:24,406
- Where did you find her? - The bathtub.

1379
02:24:24,574 --> 02:24:28,118
Call Respiratory stat. Give her large-bore normal saline. Wide open.

1380
02:24:28,286 --> 02:24:31,413
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders. I need two units, O-negative.

1381
02:24:31,581 --> 02:24:34,624
- Let's type and cross her for six. - Looks like she's in sinus tach.

1382
02:24:34,792 --> 02:24:36,668
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.

1383
02:24:36,836 --> 02:24:38,628
Can you have Respiratory come now?

1384
02:24:38,796 --> 02:24:41,506
Let's have x-ray ready for post-intubation chest x-ray.

1385
02:24:46,512 --> 02:24:51,141
Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery and she's in the recovery room now, okay?

1386
02:24:51,309 --> 02:24:55,479
Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will be out to speak to you in a few moments.

1387
02:24:55,646 --> 02:24:57,522
- She's okay? - She's doing good.

1388
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:59,858
- She's gonna be okay. - She's gonna be okay.

1389
02:25:00,026 --> 02:25:02,903
- Oh, my baby. - She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1390
02:25:03,071 --> 02:25:06,198
- It's all right. - Why'd she do this to herself? Why?

1391
02:25:06,366 --> 02:25:10,577
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

1392
02:25:11,621 --> 02:25:13,455
There.

1393
02:25:13,873 --> 02:25:16,792
It's all right, honey. It's gonna be all right.

1394
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:19,002
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1395
02:25:19,170 --> 02:25:20,212
- You understand? - Yeah.

1396
02:25:20,380 --> 02:25:22,464
I ain't going anywhere.

1397
02:25:35,269 --> 02:25:36,269
Yeah?

1398
02:25:36,771 --> 02:25:37,771
It's me.

1399
02:25:38,356 --> 02:25:41,608
Plane's in the air now. It'll be right on time.

1400
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:45,821
On the driver's end, I still can't find nobody, so that's in the trust.

1401
02:25:45,988 --> 02:25:47,864
One other thing.

1402
02:25:48,324 --> 02:25:49,908
You asked, so I gotta tell you.

1403
02:25:50,743 --> 02:25:53,620
The guy you wanted checked into the Marquis under "Jameson"...

1404
02:25:53,788 --> 02:25:57,165
...if you still give a shit, which I figured you wouldn't.

1405
02:25:57,333 --> 02:26:01,086
- You figured right. - So, so long, brother.

1406
02:26:02,797 --> 02:26:04,756
You take it easy.

1407
02:26:04,924 --> 02:26:06,508
You're home free.

1408
02:26:08,261 --> 02:26:10,220
Take it easy.

1409
02:26:20,565 --> 02:26:23,316
- What is it? - Nothing.

1410
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:25,026
Home free.

1411
02:27:02,982 --> 02:27:05,901
- I gotta take care of something. - Is there time?

1412
02:27:06,903 --> 02:27:08,570
There's time.

1413
02:27:36,974 --> 02:27:40,101
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1414
02:28:21,519 --> 02:28:23,979
- Registration. - Yeah, this is Room Service.

1415
02:28:24,146 --> 02:28:27,983
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up his room number. Could you give it to me?

1416
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:30,026
- They're always doing that. - Yeah, I know.

1417
02:28:30,194 --> 02:28:33,280
- 1735. - Thank you.

1418
02:30:16,759 --> 02:30:18,468
Your attention, please.

1419
02:30:18,636 --> 02:30:21,888
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

1420
02:30:22,056 --> 02:30:25,433
Please do not panic. Please do not take the elevators.

1421
02:30:29,438 --> 02:30:32,065
Shit. Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.

1422
02:30:32,233 --> 02:30:35,819
I'm checking the stairs. If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.

1423
02:30:40,116 --> 02:30:42,534
What about her dad? You want me to call him?

1424
02:30:43,536 --> 02:30:46,371
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1425
02:30:47,832 --> 02:30:49,999
And she chose you.

1426
02:30:52,002 --> 02:30:54,379
She picked your place.

1427
02:30:55,923 --> 02:30:57,403
It's not right, what happened to her.

1428
02:30:59,051 --> 02:31:00,385
No, it's not.

1429
02:31:03,806 --> 02:31:05,849
Ugh, okay.

1430
02:31:16,026 --> 02:31:18,153
Is there any way...

1431
02:31:20,114 --> 02:31:22,615
...that it could work out between us?

1432
02:31:24,994 --> 02:31:27,579
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1433
02:31:27,747 --> 02:31:31,040
But in the end...

1434
02:31:35,504 --> 02:31:37,672
You know, it's like you said:

1435
02:31:40,384 --> 02:31:45,054
All I am, is what I'm going after.

1436
02:31:51,937 --> 02:31:54,856
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1437
02:32:05,326 --> 02:32:07,952
Well, go on, if you have to.

1438
02:32:08,120 --> 02:32:09,704
No.

1439
02:32:09,997 --> 02:32:13,208
- I'll stay. - No, I'm okay. I can... I can handle this.

1440
02:32:16,378 --> 02:32:18,379
Just be careful.

1441
02:32:18,631 --> 02:32:21,382
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1442
02:32:22,301 --> 02:32:23,843
Okay?

1443
02:33:05,719 --> 02:33:06,761
Take the stairs.

1444
02:33:20,734 --> 02:33:21,776
Yeah?

1445
02:33:23,988 --> 02:33:28,157
Security. There's a fire on 3. We have to evacuate all the floors.

1446
02:33:28,325 --> 02:33:29,951
I can't leave here.

1447
02:33:38,836 --> 02:33:42,255
Why don't we just talk about this a bit, huh, brother?

1448
02:33:56,270 --> 02:33:57,312
He's here on 17.

1449
02:34:00,482 --> 02:34:02,817
Look at me. Look at me.

1450
02:34:06,155 --> 02:34:07,322
Look at me.

1451
02:34:39,229 --> 02:34:43,107
L.A.P.D. Don't move. Put your hands on your head, now.

1452
02:35:18,227 --> 02:35:20,561
Switch me to TAC 5.

1453
02:35:20,729 --> 02:35:23,064
Casals? JJ?

1454
02:35:23,983 --> 02:35:25,191
Drucker, JJ?

1455
02:35:25,359 --> 02:35:27,902
I'm at the lobby level by the stairwell.

1456
02:35:28,070 --> 02:35:29,070
What have you got?

1457
02:35:29,238 --> 02:35:32,407
Teams are moving up the other elevators to the 17th floor elevators.

1458
02:35:32,574 --> 02:35:34,742
All out of commission because of the fire alarm.

1459
02:35:34,910 --> 02:35:38,037
- It's a mess. People everywhere. - Fine. 10-4.

1460
02:36:07,860 --> 02:36:09,444
Let's go, get out of the way.

1461
02:36:09,611 --> 02:36:11,529
Stay out of the way.

1462
02:36:19,455 --> 02:36:22,498
Let's go. Go that way. We gotta go, all right? Go, go.

1463
02:36:25,627 --> 02:36:27,545
I got it, sir.

1464
02:36:29,673 --> 02:36:31,591
Come on, come on.

1465
02:36:37,431 --> 02:36:39,057
Come on, sir.

1466
02:36:43,312 --> 02:36:46,314
- Watch your backs, ladies. - I got it, I got it.

1467
02:36:48,984 --> 02:36:50,651
Keep moving, ma'am.

1468
02:36:51,487 --> 02:36:52,570
Let's go.

1469
02:36:55,074 --> 02:36:56,324
Come on, let's go.

1470
02:37:30,943 --> 02:37:32,610
This way, ma'am.

1471
02:37:34,571 --> 02:37:36,364
Get back, get back.

1472
02:38:02,224 --> 02:38:04,642
- Let me have that shotgun. - Yes, sir.

1473
02:44:22,103 --> 02:44:24,855
Told you I'm never going back.

1474
02:44:28,193 --> 02:44:29,818
Yeah.
