手法  是职业劫匪所为
M.O. is that they're good.

129
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,198

Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all of them...

130

之后便不再迟疑
...after they killed the first two guards, they didn't hesitate...

131
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:19,497
杀了第三名  因为横竖也是犯罪
...popped guard number three because what difference does it make?

132
00:17:19,665 --> 00:17:21,416
为何留下证人呢
Why leave a living witness?

133

他们会毫不迟疑  心狠手辣

显示劫匪的技术是精通的

136
00:17:33,387 --> 00:17:35,304
足以使他们在途中下手

137

向炸弹组查问用的是什么炸药
From the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

If we're lucky, it's exotic. We can trace the sale.

145
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,417
你别伸手进那人的口袋
Get your hand out of that man's pocket, Rachel.

146
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:05,668

147
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,969
有谁要吃批饼
Want some pie?

148

我要上厕所
Gotta go to the john.

149
00:18:56,637 --> 00:19:00,723
他作势攻击  我要先下手为强
Look, I had to get it on, man. He was making a move. I had to get it on.

150
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:17,907
他那份在车上  我们的均分了
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

151
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,910
以便全数给他
...to make up for his full end.

152
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:24,580
因为我想立即分给他  打发这杂种
Because I wanna pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.

153
00:19:24,748 --> 00:19:25,748
好的
Okay.

154
00:20:04,413 --> 00:20:06,038
等一等
Hold it!

155
00:21:41,218 --> 00:21:42,760
嘿

你打扮得很漂亮  我想在这儿和你做爱

- Where is it? - Uh, squared the bookies, baby.

159

几天后还会有钱  放心吧
There's more in a couple days, so don't sweat it. We really are late.

160
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,615
少胡说  你一定是说笑
Yeah, come on, you gotta be kidding me.

161
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:09,120
亲爱的  就为了区区八千元值得冒这个险吗
Honey, it ain't worth the risks you take for 8000.

162
00:22:09,287 --> 00:22:12,123
危险和报酬要成正比
Like in risk versus reward, baby.

163
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,625
走吧  拿上你的外衣
Let's go. Get your coat.

164
00:22:16,753 --> 00:22:20,047
无谓再说  你心智还没成熟
There is no point talking to you. All you are is a child growing older.

165
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:21,549
什么意思
What's that supposed to mean?

166
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:25,886
我们不像成年人那样有进步
It means we're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults, living our lives.

167
00:22:26,054 --> 00:22:28,305
因为我嫁给了一个赌徒
I'm married to a gambling junkie who won't listen.

168

你不用  你离开这里时
You're not! What do you want from me? Leave the bankbook and car keys...

171
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:41,110
留下银行存折和车匙
...in the kitchen on your way out. Are we going, or am I going alone?

172
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,779
你留着吧  我只带多明一起走
You could keep that other crap but Dominick would go with me.

- Too common to trace a sale, Vincent. - Oh, that's wonderful.

180
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:54,642
你没事吧
Are you all right?

266
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:24,615
我一个人  可我并不寂寞
I... I'm alone. I am not lonely.

267
00:30:24,782 --> 00:30:26,492
你呢
You?

268
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:29,411
很寂寞
I get lonely.

269
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,579
亚拔
Albert!

270
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,541
- 糟了  - 亚拔
- Shit. - Albert.

271
00:32:39,709 --> 00:32:41,668
你为何来这儿
Vincent, what you doing coming here, man?

272
00:32:41,836 --> 00:32:43,211
你疯了吗
You crazy? This ain't Disneyland.

273
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:48,008
你该回覆我电话的  你去了哪儿
You were supposed to get back to me last night, Albert. Where the fuck you been?

274
00:32:48,551 --> 00:32:52,262
- 我无法脱身  - 我们侵犯他的民权吧
- I couldn't break free, Vincent. You know. - Let's violate his ass right now.

275
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:56,558
我帮你忙  你却不帮我  是这样吗
I do for you, you don't do for me, is that it?

276
00:32:57,268 --> 00:32:59,561
我整晚外出
Vincent, man, I swear, I was out all night, man.

277
00:32:59,729 --> 00:33:02,064
为你刺探消息
I'm hitting like one of them flamingo-matador guys.

278
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,358
此事和我无关
Flamingo? That's got nothing to do with me.

279
00:33:04,525 --> 00:33:07,944
我顺利为你找到线索
I was cutting it real smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you.

280
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,489
- 我很棒  - 你胡说
- I'm a dancer, man. You know. - Bullshit.

281
00:33:10,657 --> 00:33:13,075
我传呼你一整天  我讨厌这样做
I paged your ass all day. I can't stand paging.

282
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:15,827
你又再是瘾君子  注射毒品
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.

283
00:33:15,995 --> 00:33:18,914
我有滥用药物的问题  心领吧
Where is your empathy, brother? It's a substance-abuse problem.

284
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:20,374
我昨天对你心领
Empathy was yesterday.

285
00:33:20,541 --> 00:33:22,501
你今天却浪费我时间
Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

286
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:24,836
- 听着  - 你恋爱了吗
- Vincent, man, look... - Did you fall in love?

287
00:33:25,004 --> 00:33:28,423
你是否恋爱和到别处去啦
Come on. Did you fall in love last night and you went off somewhere?

288
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,926
- 云信  - 我会接受这解释
- Vincent... - Just tell me that. I'll settle for it.

289
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:33,762
- 我会信的  - 云信
- I'll buy that. - Vincent.

290
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,055
把消息告诉我
Give me all you got!

291
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,224
- 云信  - 把资料对我说
- Vincent... - Give me all you got!

292
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:41,228
我发誓  我哥哥里察会跟你说
I swear, man, my brother, man. My brother Richard's gonna talk to you.

293
00:33:41,396 --> 00:33:43,105
你是说里察吗
I heard "Richard"?

294
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,399
- 他会和你说的  - 里察
- He's gonna talk to you. - Richard?

295
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:46,900
- 里察  - 里察

296
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:50,112
- 他今晚会见你  - 他在这儿
- He's gonna meet you, I swear, tonight. - He's not here, is he?

297
00:33:50,613 --> 00:33:53,615
- 不  他会见你  - 现在不行吗
- No, he's gonna meet you tonight. - Tonight? What happened to now?

298
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:57,577
我恳求他  因为我知道你今早会到来
I... I... I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.

299
00:33:57,745 --> 00:33:59,871
- 胡说  - 没有  我发誓
- This is a bunch of bullshit. - No, no, I swear.

300
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,749
他不肯的  因为他在凤凰城
He said no because he in Phoenix.

302
00:34:04,794 --> 00:34:06,378
我到了凤凰城后
By the time I get to Phoenix,

303
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:09,131
他会起程
He'll be risin',

304
00:34:09,966 --> 00:34:13,385
可能留下字条  贴在门上
He'll probably leave a note right on the door

305
00:34:13,553 --> 00:34:15,762
我只能令他今晚见你
Tonight's the best I can do for you, man.

306
00:34:16,431 --> 00:34:22,060
今晚在艾华瓦度街BJ夜总会
You know? He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado...

307
00:34:22,353 --> 00:34:24,563
凌晨二时  你去吧
...at 2 a.m. Be there.

308
00:34:24,731 --> 00:34:26,148
你亦要到
You be there too.

309
00:34:26,315 --> 00:34:29,192
不行  我有事要办
Vincent, I can't be there, man. I got things to do, Vincent.

310
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,821
- 我有事办  要到别处  - 嘿

Be there.

312
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,874
你别浪费我的时间
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

313
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,879
是什么买卖
What is it?

314
00:34:50,131 --> 00:34:51,673
是银行
It's a bank.

315
00:34:51,841 --> 00:34:55,135
星期四会存钱以便分发各分行
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...

316
00:34:55,303 --> 00:34:57,345

317
00:34:57,513 --> 00:35:00,682
总行夹万内星期四总放满现钞
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.

- 在途中下手还是劫银行  - 由正门进入
- On the prowl or strong? - Strong. Through the front door.

319
00:35:03,686 --> 00:35:05,520
有多少人
How many guys?

320
00:35:05,688 --> 00:35:08,690
连司机四人  走进银行  得手便走
Four, or three plus a driver. Walk in, knock them over, walk out.

321
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,233
你要先拿十万
And you want a 100,000 advance...

322
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:12,694
事成后分一成
...against a 10-percent cut for that?

323
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,156
听似是西部牛仔劫银行  他们按动警钟
Sounds like an address to a cowboy score. They hit the holdup alarms...

324
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,034
我得在之前离去
...I gotta get out before the cops show. What is that?

325
00:35:19,243 --> 00:35:21,578
他们可按动三个遇劫警钟

两个一般警钟和一个蜂窝式的

327
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:28,668
但讯号无法传送出去  因为
See, but the signals aren't going anywhere because...

328
00:35:28,836 --> 00:35:34,674
之前一晚  你潜进银行  破坏警报系统的电脑
See, the night before, you cut in and trick out the alarm-system computer...

329
00:35:34,842 --> 00:35:40,430
使电脑及录影装置在你下手前二十分钟关掉
...to turn itself and the video recorders off 20 minutes before you walk in the door.

330
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,141
你有建筑及电子蓝图吗

我有  我建造电脑板  直驳中央处理器
I got all that. Schematics, got the boards already built. They go straight into the CPU.

332
00:35:48,898 --> 00:35:50,565
估计可有多少钱
What's the estimate?

333
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:56,530
一千两百一十万到一千两百二十万
12.1, 12.2 million.

334
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:00,534
我会参加
You're on.

335
00:36:01,452 --> 00:36:02,744
恭喜
Congratulations.

336
00:36:02,912 --> 00:36:06,873
我告诉你如何估计会有这笔钱
And to give you a little idea of where my estimates come from, this is a printout...

337
00:36:07,041 --> 00:36:09,459
没人知道货是你的
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

338
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:13,129
我让你得保险全数
Be that as it may, my way you get 100 percent from the insurance company...

339
00:36:13,297 --> 00:36:15,966
赔偿以六成价  把债券回购
...and take the bonds from us at 60 cents on the dollar...

340
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:18,218
你可多赚四成
...and make yourself another 40 percent.

341
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,764
行动全无损失  我们均可赚大钱
Your operation doesn't skip a beat. Everybody makes out.

342
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:25,433
我同意
Sure, you got a deal.

343
00:36:25,601 --> 00:36:29,312
好  若大家不喜欢便没得益
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

344
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:33,108
要你的人给我电话  安排会面
Yeah, so you have your man call me and we'll set the meet.

345
00:36:33,276 --> 00:36:34,651
行啊  可以
Yeah, okay.

346
00:36:35,278 --> 00:36:36,486
高兴和你通电话
Nice talking to you.

347

你要和他们交易吗
You gonna deal with these guys?

348
00:36:39,282 --> 00:36:42,284
江湖上可接受我偷自己的东西吗
So word's out on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.

349
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:45,120
我会杀了这班浑蛋
I'm gonna kill the sons of bitches.

350
00:36:45,288 --> 00:36:48,582
命哈利给我加那利群岛的试算纸
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Islands' offshore.

351
00:36:53,504 --> 00:36:56,047
这些不是估计  是实在数字
That's not really an estimate. Those are exact figures.

352
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,509
我印出银行过去两月的现金帐
I have a printout of the, uh, cash flow of the bank for the past two months.

353
00:36:59,677 --> 00:37:02,304

- How'd you get this information? - Just comes to you.

354

资料府拾皆是
This stuff just flies through the air.

355
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:07,475
到处传送  只需加以掌握便行
They send information out and it's beamed out all over the place.

356
00:37:07,643 --> 00:37:10,979
我懂得掌握
All you have to do is know how to grab it. See, I know how to grab it.

- 我同意了  - 好啊
- I bought it. - Good.

359
00:37:25,745 --> 00:37:27,537

我无好好供养她
Not enough steaks in the freezer.

374
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:09,347
我们做买卖还不够钱吗
With everything we've been doing?

375
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,351
赌场及赌球赛使我身无分文
Vegas and the Super Bowl cleaned me out.

我不知你做什么
I don't know what you're doing.

383
00:39:37,668 --> 00:39:39,878
如占美说
Remember Jimmy MacAwain on the yard used to say:

384
00:39:40,046 --> 00:39:41,963
你想当罪犯吗
You wanna be making moves on the street?

385
00:39:42,131 --> 00:39:45,133
要无牵挂  生活中不能有任何牵挂
Have no attachments. Allow nothing to be in your life...

386
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:47,719

...that you cannot walk out on in 30 seconds flat...

387
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,346
一走了之

394
00:40:18,167 --> 00:40:21,211
然后为劫银行的事存钱给祈素
...then I drop our deposit on Kelso for this bank.

395
00:40:21,378 --> 00:40:22,670
什么银行
Bank? What bank?

396

他是坐言起行的人
He's a big fiend for action.

469
00:47:01,862 --> 00:47:05,364
若他不说  我便不会去想  可是
Now, if he'd have said nothing, I'd have thought nothing...

470
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:09,243
他不断的对我说他什么也没做
...but he goes on and on, running down to me how he ain't been doing nothing...

...and nothing's been going on, and all this bullshit.

他为人紧张
You know what I'm saying?

483
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:58,501
- 你说什么  - 什么

00:53:05,934 --> 00:53:07,601
你疯了
You are insane.

526
00:53:12,691 --> 00:53:13,732
喜欢吗
Do you like it?

527
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:15,776
- 很漂亮  - 是啊  很漂亮
- It's beautiful. - Yeah, it's pretty good.

528
00:53:15,944 --> 00:53:19,280
- 别问他哪儿得来的  - 对  别问
- Just don't ask him where he got it. - Yeah, that's right.

529
00:53:26,663 --> 00:53:28,998
你长大后想做什么  宝贝
What do you wanna be when you grow up, honey?

530
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:31,375
我不知道
I don't know.

531
00:53:33,795 --> 00:53:36,547
她不知道  像我一样  我亦不知道
She doesn't know. Just like me. I don't know either.

532
00:53:51,146 --> 00:53:52,479
你好
Hello?

533
00:53:52,981 --> 00:53:54,565
嗨  是我
Hi, it's me.

534
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:58,485
我在想你是否会来电话
Hey. I was wondering if you'd call.

535
00:53:59,696 --> 00:54:02,573
我很忙  我能见你吗
I've been busy. Can I see you?

536
00:54:03,116 --> 00:54:07,745
我害怕那只是一夜情
I was afraid that was just the one night, you know?

537
00:54:08,455 --> 00:54:10,831
对我来说不是
No, not for me, it wasn't.

538
00:54:12,876 --> 00:54:14,919
我也不是
Yeah, me neither.

539
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:18,339
我能来吗
Can I fall by?

540
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:22,676
- 可以  - 好的  一会儿见
- Yeah. - Okay, I'll see you in a little bit.

541
00:54:33,063 --> 00:54:34,855
谢谢
Thank you.

542
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:37,358
晚安
Good night.

543
00:54:37,859 --> 00:54:39,902
可恶的会议
Goddamn convention.

544
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,155
- 哪一个是滑头  - 魁悟的那个
- Which one's Slick? - The wide one.

545
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:44,531
有两个监视器
Got two transmitters.

546
00:54:44,699 --> 00:54:47,743
分别在防火板及轮内
One's in the wheel well, backup's in the firewall.

547
00:54:48,161 --> 00:54:49,370
是我们的车
Okay, get ready.

548
00:54:49,537 --> 00:54:51,747
- 跟尼尔道别了吗  - 晚安
- Did you say good night to Neil? - Good night.

549
00:54:51,915 --> 00:54:55,542
金发的是施基斯  特别调查组已派人跟踪他
One with the blond hair is Chris Shiherlis. SIS has got a revolving tail...

550
00:54:55,710 --> 00:54:57,503
并监听了他家的座机
...and hung a wire on the house phone.

551
00:54:59,464 --> 00:55:03,050
查把车三次驶过贵重金属库
Cheritto's cruised the precious-metals depository three times.

552
00:55:03,218 --> 00:55:06,095
白金银和一些金条
Platinum, silver, and some bullion.

553
00:55:06,638 --> 00:55:09,223
森美和我认为是他们下一目标
Sammy and I think that's gonna be their next score.

554
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:11,392
那独行者是谁
Who's the loner?

555
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:17,398
我们第一次见他  还没开始跟踪他
First time we're seeing him. We're not on him yet.

556
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:21,068
立即开始吧
Well, get on it.

557
00:55:29,744 --> 00:55:31,328
好的
Okay.

558
00:55:38,461 --> 00:55:44,550
他们下次做案得手走出大门时
When these guys walk out the door of whatever score they're gonna take next...

559
00:55:44,926 --> 00:55:48,595
一定会大感惊愕
...they're gonna have the surprise of a lifetime.

560
00:56:03,862 --> 00:56:06,363
我要走了
Hey, baby. Time to go.

561
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:09,533
我令你很开心吧
I showed you a good time, didn't I?

562
00:56:09,701 --> 00:56:11,744
是啊
Oh, yeah.

563
00:56:12,996 --> 00:56:16,206
你很棒  你不错
You fly. You cool.

564
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:27,551
你骗我  我看得出别人骗我
You're lying to me. I can always tell when people lie to me.

565
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:31,722
我没说谎  你很勇猛
Mm, I ain't lying. You a hot dog.

566
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,475
是出色的骑士
A regular rodeo rider.

567
00:56:34,642 --> 00:56:38,020
是我试过最精彩的性行为
And this was the monster fuck of my young life.

568
00:56:42,108 --> 00:56:44,735
我现在得回到街上去
Now I got to get my ass street side, sugar.

569
00:56:44,903 --> 00:56:47,196
你没有老实的作风
You don't have a truth-telling style.

570
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:51,909
- 你说什么  - 你不知道是什么回事
- What are you talking about? - You don't know what this is.

571
00:56:57,832 --> 00:57:00,876
是死神来探望你
The Grim Reaper's visiting with you.

572
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:20,979
你去了哪儿
Where you been?

573
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,191
塘鹅弯的特别收容所
SHU at Pelican Bay.

574
00:57:24,359 --> 00:57:26,735
以及霍森监狱B座
New Folsom, B-wing.

575
00:57:27,028 --> 00:57:31,115
我是一个想做大买卖的人
I am a cowboy looking for anything heavy.

576
00:57:31,282 --> 00:57:33,992
比利说来找你
Billy Ricketts said come see you.

577
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,537
因此我到来
That is why I am here.

578
00:57:43,044 --> 00:57:44,795
你为何不
Why don't you...?

579
00:57:45,171 --> 00:57:48,507
你为何不打电话给这人
Why don't you call this guy?

580
00:57:48,675 --> 00:57:51,343
他经常招人入伙
This guy's always putting guys on.

581
00:57:55,181 --> 00:57:56,223
谢谢  兄弟
Thank you, brother.

582
00:57:57,684 --> 00:57:59,977
- 我要请你喝酒吗  - 请我喝酒
- I'll buy you a drink? - Buy me a drink.

583
00:58:05,608 --> 00:58:07,234
- 笑什么  - 没什么
- What's so funny? - Nothing.

584
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:10,612
- 这家伙  真够傻的  - 你在责备我吗
- It's really dumb. - Something smells negligent.

585
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:13,699
你们天生一对
You two are perfect for each other. How did you meet?

586
00:58:18,288 --> 00:58:20,539
我念小学时认识一人
I knew this guy in, uh, grade school.

587
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:22,875
他叫罗尔  什么的
He was named Raoul, uh... Whatever.

588
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:26,712
他可以把手指彼此屈折起来
Anyway, the guy could take his fingers and fold them over, one over the other.

589
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,839
他可以把眼睑向外翻
Then he'd turn his eyelids inside out...

590
00:58:29,549 --> 00:58:33,010
我禁不住对你上下其手  是真的
I can't keep my hands off you, and that's the truth.

591
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:38,515
你吸引人的地方在于你那兽性的方式
That's what's so wonderful about you, in that bestial sort of way.

592
00:58:42,604 --> 00:58:44,229
女人
Woman.

593
00:58:50,361 --> 00:58:52,613
这最好是轰动的大事
This better be earth-shattering.

594
00:58:58,244 --> 00:59:00,662
为罗尔干杯
That's what she tells us. To Raoul.

595
00:59:00,830 --> 00:59:02,873
- 罗尔  - 敬罗尔
- Raoul. - To Raoul.

596
00:59:03,041 --> 00:59:05,209
我是韩·云信
Yeah, Vincent Hanna.

597
00:59:47,085 --> 00:59:49,378
发现她时是这样的
Here's how we found her.

598
00:59:53,258 --> 00:59:55,676
- 她有多大  - 十六七岁
- How old? - Sixteen, seventeen.

599
00:59:55,843 --> 00:59:57,886
在此约六小时
Been here about six hours.

600
00:59:58,054 --> 00:59:59,513
她怎么死的
How'd she die, Rachel?

601
00:59:59,681 --> 01:00:03,100
头部遭受重击  大脑血肿
Beat her head in, same as the others. Cerebral hematoma.

602
01:00:05,853 --> 01:00:07,062
那是谁
Who's that?

603
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:10,315
- 我猜是死者母亲及兄弟  - 他们为何到来
- Mother and siblings, I guess. - What the hell they doing here?

604
01:00:10,483 --> 01:00:14,194
酒店内有人认识死者  就通知了家人
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.

605
01:00:14,862 --> 01:00:16,530
让我看看
Okay, let's go.

606
01:00:20,576 --> 01:00:22,411
不错
That's nice.

607
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:26,748
直觉告诉我  化验精液是同一人
When I run a DNA check on the semen, my intuition says it's coming up the same guy.

608
01:00:26,916 --> 01:00:30,127
是连环谋杀案  要由你着手调查
So it's a series, and ending up in your court.

609
01:00:30,295 --> 01:00:33,422
- 警长有头绪吗  - 还没有
- Sheriff's Homicide getting anywhere? - Not yet.

610
01:00:34,674 --> 01:00:36,425
- 拦住她  - 放开我
- Get her. - Get off me. Get off me.

611
01:00:36,634 --> 01:00:38,093
噢
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

612
01:00:39,095 --> 01:00:40,762
- 天啊  - 冷静
- Oh, my God. - Hold it, hold it.

613
01:00:44,809 --> 01:00:48,312
- 她在哪儿  - 冷静
- Where is she? - Easy, easy, easy.

614
01:00:50,148 --> 01:00:52,774
别这样
Please. Please, come on.

615
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:58,488
- 没事的  - 谁干的
- It's okay. It's okay. - Who did this?

616
01:00:58,656 --> 01:01:01,700
我的女儿呢  她在哪儿
Where's my baby? Where is she?

617
01:01:02,535 --> 01:01:05,245
我要知道是什么回事
I need to know what happened.

618
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,247
我猜是很轰动吧
I guess the Earth shattered.

619
01:01:49,499 --> 01:01:53,251
你为何不让博高送你回家
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

620
01:01:54,212 --> 01:01:58,131
我不想扫他们的兴  有什么事
I didn't wanna ruin their night too. What was it?

621
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:01,676
你不想知道的
You don't wanna know.

622
01:02:01,844 --> 01:02:04,179
我想知道你为何扳起脸孔
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look.

623
01:02:04,347 --> 01:02:07,808
我不能透露  你是知道的
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go. Come on.

624
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:11,686
你从没告诉我  我会摒诸事外
You never told me I'd be excluded.

625
01:02:12,897 --> 01:02:17,150
我告诉你  我们在一起时  你要和我分享
I told you when we hooked up, baby, that you were gonna have to share me...

626
01:02:17,318 --> 01:02:21,071
世上所有的丑行及丑恶的人
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.

627
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:25,659
我同意接受分享  因为我爱你
And I bought into that sharing because I love you.

628
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:31,748
即使你发胖  秃头  没钱  我仍会爱你
I love you fat, bald, money, no money, driving a bus. I don't care.

629
01:02:32,041 --> 01:02:35,127
但你一定要存在
But you have got to be present like a normal guy some of the time.

630
01:02:35,294 --> 01:02:37,838
那是分享  这不是分享  是残余的
That's sharing. This is not sharing, this is leftovers.

631
01:02:38,005 --> 01:02:41,007
明白了  我该回家  然后我该说
Oh, I see. What I should do is come home and say:

632
01:02:41,551 --> 01:02:45,053
宝贝儿  你知道吗  我今天走进一所房子
Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...

633
01:02:45,221 --> 01:02:48,974
这瘾君子用微波炉煮熟了孩子
...where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...

634
01:02:49,142 --> 01:02:52,769
就因为他的哭声太吵闹  我和你分享吧
...because it was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.

635
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:55,772
让我们分享此事  而在分享时
Come on, let's share that, and in sharing it...

636
01:02:55,940 --> 01:03:01,945
我们会宣泄一切可怕的事件  对吗
...we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit, right?

637
01:03:04,574 --> 01:03:06,950
错  你知道为什么吗
Wrong. You know why?

638
01:03:07,118 --> 01:03:09,286
你喜欢正常的做法
Because you prefer the normal routine.

639
01:03:09,454 --> 01:03:11,663
我们做爱  你不说话
We fuck, then you lose the power of speech.

640
01:03:11,831 --> 01:03:14,374
我得保持我的痛苦
Because I gotta hold on to my angst.

641
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:18,336
我保存它  因为我需要藉此提高警觉
I preserve it, because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

642
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:21,923
我要这样做
Where I gotta be.

643
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,765
你不是和我同住
You don't live with me.

644
01:03:33,019 --> 01:03:36,188
你和死者的残骸同住
You live among the remains of dead people.

645
01:03:39,317 --> 01:03:40,817
你筛选碎片  在地势找线索
You read the terrain.

646
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:45,322
你找寻死亡的迹象
You search for signs of passing...

647
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:47,532
找猎物的气味
...for the scent of your prey...

648
01:03:47,700 --> 01:03:49,493
然后追捕他们
...and then you hunt them down.

649
01:03:51,412 --> 01:03:54,706
这是你唯一投入的事
That's the only thing you're committed to.

650
01:03:57,543 --> 01:04:00,795
其余的是你留下的烂摊子
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.

651
01:04:05,551 --> 01:04:09,387
我不明白为何不能离开你
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.

652
01:04:24,695 --> 01:04:27,155
嘿  莉莉安
Hey. Miss Lillian.

653
01:04:28,783 --> 01:04:30,909
走吧  宝贝
Let's go, baby.

654
01:04:33,162 --> 01:04:37,207
我见过经理  那是老板吗
I met the manager. Is that the boss?

655
01:04:37,792 --> 01:04:40,544
我为他每天所做的事而坐牢
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.

656
01:04:40,711 --> 01:04:45,131
你可忍受直至找到新工作吗
Baby, can you just handle it till we find you something new?

657
01:04:45,591 --> 01:04:47,467
你可以吗
Can you do that?

658
01:04:49,303 --> 01:04:52,514
更难忍受的我亦捱过
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.

659
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:00,814
你为何和我在一起  莉莉安
What you hanging with me for, Lillian?

660
01:05:02,024 --> 01:05:04,317
因为你令我感骄傲
Because I'm proud of you.

661
01:05:09,907 --> 01:05:12,951
你以我为荣吗
You're proud of me?

662
01:05:16,372 --> 01:05:18,957
为什么
What the hell you proud of me for?

663
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:21,918
回家吧
Come on home.

664
01:05:32,221 --> 01:05:35,682
- 你在哪儿做什么  - 我滑雪
- What were you doing there? - I was skiing.

665
01:05:35,850 --> 01:05:38,059
我想滑雪
I was trying to ski.

666
01:05:38,352 --> 01:05:41,605
那儿的人会这样做  去滑雪
That's what people do there. You go skiing...

667
01:05:42,189 --> 01:05:44,107
可结识别人
...and you meet people.

668
01:05:44,275 --> 01:05:45,775
你想开心一下
You try to have a good time.

669
01:05:45,943 --> 01:05:47,611
- 你开心吗  - 不
- Did you have a good time? - No.

670
01:05:47,778 --> 01:05:48,903
为什么
Why not?

671
01:05:49,322 --> 01:05:51,406
我不擅交际
I'm not good at meeting people.

672
01:05:51,574 --> 01:05:53,491
你认识了我
You met me.

673
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:56,578
我没仔细想  事情便发生了
Well, that happened without my thinking about it.

674
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:59,247
可能是因为这样
Which is why, probably.

675
01:05:59,415 --> 01:06:01,958
不  是因为你是个好女人
No, it's because you were fine.

676
01:06:03,961 --> 01:06:05,545
伊荻
Eady.

677
01:06:06,714 --> 01:06:09,257
和我到外地去
Take off with me for a while.

678
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:12,510
- 去哪儿  - 新西兰
- Where? - New Zealand.

679
01:06:14,347 --> 01:06:15,930
何时
When?

680
01:06:17,016 --> 01:06:19,476
我不能和你同去  但你可以在那儿与我会和
I have to go separate, but you could meet me there.

681
01:06:20,186 --> 01:06:21,645
但我的工作
But my job, my...

682
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:26,650
我有钱  你不用工作  你可以在那儿开设计公司
I got money. You don't need money. You could set up a studio, do work there.

683
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:29,653
- 我不知道  - 还要知道什么
- I don't know. - What's there to know?

684
01:06:29,820 --> 01:06:31,780
你结婚了吗
Are you married?

685
01:06:32,865 --> 01:06:34,449
- 什么  - 你来了又走了
- What? - You come and go...

686
01:06:34,617 --> 01:06:36,242
我才没有结婚
The last thing I am is married.

687
01:06:36,410 --> 01:06:39,454
我的生活正在走下坡
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way, a double blank.

688
01:06:39,622 --> 01:06:41,456
可是  突然
Then, all of a sudden...

689
01:06:42,124 --> 01:06:44,668
出现了你这样的人
...someone like you comes along.

690
01:06:47,838 --> 01:06:50,840
- 你不了解我  - 足够了解了
- You don't know me, Neil. - I know enough.

691
01:06:54,470 --> 01:06:56,388
跟我走
Come with me.

692
01:07:05,690 --> 01:07:07,816
有何不妥
What's wrong, baby?

693
01:07:08,984 --> 01:07:12,278
没什么  一切妥当  你会去吗
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?

694
01:07:16,659 --> 01:07:18,368
会
Yeah.

695
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:23,248
好
Good.

696
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:49,816
- 嘿  亲爱的  - 嗨
- Hey, sweetie. - Hi.

697
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:53,194
你忘记妈妈会接你吗
What happened? You forget your mom was picking you up?

698
01:07:54,363 --> 01:07:56,156
不是
No.

699
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,534
怎么回事
So, what's going on?

700
01:08:00,953 --> 01:08:03,246
我想独自一人待着
I felt like being alone.

701
01:08:04,915 --> 01:08:07,876
好吧  上车  我送你回家
Okay. Come on, I'll drive you home.

702
01:08:12,715 --> 01:08:16,384
- 嘿  麦克  - 嘿  罗兰
- Hey, Mike. - Hey, Lauren.

703
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:05,600
有何动静
What's happening?

704
01:09:06,852 --> 01:09:08,603
长官
Lieutenant. Sir.

705
01:09:08,771 --> 01:09:11,397
杰克逊警长想知道有何动静
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

706
01:09:11,565 --> 01:09:14,567
没动静  不要用无线电
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

707
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:31,960
杰克逊
Jackson's a...

708
01:10:08,789 --> 01:10:10,456
好技术
Technique.

709
01:10:29,393 --> 01:10:31,895
芝麻开门
Open sesame. Right there.

710
01:11:29,161 --> 01:11:31,162
就是他
There he goes.

711
01:12:33,308 --> 01:12:34,976
- 我们走吧  - 我快完事了
- We walk. - I'm right there.

712
01:12:35,144 --> 01:12:37,145
我们撤  即刻  快点
We walk! Now! Come on.

713
01:12:48,782 --> 01:12:50,575
他听到了
He's heard it.

714
01:12:51,285 --> 01:12:52,994
他听到了
He's heard it.

715
01:13:01,503 --> 01:13:03,087
他们来了
Heads up.

716
01:13:04,173 --> 01:13:05,882
- 有一个出来了  - 等一等  队长
- One's coming out. - Hold it, captain.

717
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:09,677
- 云信  他没带走任何东西  - 是的  我看见了
- Vincent, he's not carrying anything. - Yeah, I see.

718
01:13:13,098 --> 01:13:15,058
- 行动  - 得让我上司批准
- Here we go. - Not till my boss says so.

719
01:13:15,225 --> 01:13:17,727
云信  他们没拿东西
Vincent, both of them are not carrying anything.

720
01:13:26,820 --> 01:13:28,571
- 让他们走  - 什么意思
- Okay, let them go. - What do you mean?

721
01:13:28,739 --> 01:13:29,781
我们可以拘捕他们
We can take them...

722
01:13:29,948 --> 01:13:32,033
控以何罪  非法闯入吗
What are you gonna take them on? Breaking and entry?

723
01:13:32,201 --> 01:13:34,285
他们没偷东西  明白吗
They didn't steal anything. Don't you get it?

724
01:13:34,453 --> 01:13:36,704
行为不检
It gets knocked back to some misdemeanor...

725
01:13:36,872 --> 01:13:39,373
他们坐牢半年便出狱  不行
...they do six months and they're out. No fucking way.

726
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:42,668
我可不想接受批评  他们不能走
I'm not taking the heat from my boss. They're not walking.

727
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:46,506
他们会走  今次行动由我指挥
That's exactly what they're gonna do. They're gonna walk. This is my operation.

728
01:13:46,673 --> 01:13:49,050
我的战略指挥凌驾你的职级
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.

729
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:53,346
他们会离去  你会让他们走
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck.

730
01:14:38,392 --> 01:14:40,476
继续工作
Back to work.

731
01:14:41,687 --> 01:14:45,606
洛城警方  密探  警方从何而来
L.A.P.D. Gee, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?

732
01:14:45,774 --> 01:14:47,441
他们或许知道那儿会被劫
Maybe it's the score they were onto.

733
01:14:47,609 --> 01:14:51,070
但不知道是我们  因为那儿以前曾遇劫
The place, not us. Because it's been hit a couple of times, you know.

734
01:14:51,238 --> 01:14:53,906
假设他们知道我们的电话  住所
Assume they got our phones, assume they got our houses...

735
01:14:54,074 --> 01:14:56,576
知道我们在此集会
...assume they got us right here, right now as we sit.

736
01:14:56,743 --> 01:14:58,703
假设他们知道一切
Everything. Assume it all.

737
01:14:58,871 --> 01:15:00,955
我们如何付劫银行的上期
How we gonna buy the bank package from Kelso?

738
01:15:01,123 --> 01:15:04,292
- 我先垫付吧  - 宏山呢
- I'll front that. That's not a problem. - What happens to Van Zant?

739
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:08,462
警方现在正追查我们  你想和他开战吗
With the heat we got, do you wanna play World War II in the streets with Van Zant?

740
01:15:08,630 --> 01:15:10,548
不  我想拿七十五万
No, I want my 750. And he gets a pass?

741
01:15:10,716 --> 01:15:15,052
我比你更想杀了宏山  他太放肆了
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

742
01:15:15,220 --> 01:15:17,638
问题是  我们劫银行  还是离去
Our problem is, take the bank or split right now?

743
01:15:17,806 --> 01:15:20,308
不要回家收拾东西
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

744
01:15:20,475 --> 01:15:23,644
三十秒后我们会各走各路
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways.

745
01:15:23,812 --> 01:15:25,062
就这样
That's it.

746
01:15:25,230 --> 01:15:26,814
基斯
Chris.

747
01:15:29,985 --> 01:15:32,153
值得冒险劫银行
The bank is worth the risk.

748
01:15:32,321 --> 01:15:34,322
我需要钱
I need it, brother.

749
01:15:35,407 --> 01:15:39,160
我认为我们该留下来劫银行
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.

750
01:15:49,630 --> 01:15:52,757
你做什么我亦跟随
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever. Whatever.

751
01:15:52,925 --> 01:15:56,385
但今次不行  米高  你要自行决定
No, not on this one, Michael. On this one, you're on your own.

752
01:16:08,857 --> 01:16:11,359
这是最好的做法吗
You figure this is the best thing to do?

753
01:16:11,777 --> 01:16:13,361
是最好的做法吗
This is the best thing to do?

754
01:16:13,528 --> 01:16:17,782
事后我有打算  值得为这笔钱坐牢
I got plans. I'm going away after. So for me the reward is maybe worth the stretch.

755
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:20,868
但绮玲很照顾你  你有许多钱
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.

756
01:16:21,036 --> 01:16:22,536
你有物业
You got T-bonds, real estate.

757
01:16:22,704 --> 01:16:26,082
若我是你  便不参与今次行动
If I were you, I would be smart. I would cut loose of this.

758
01:16:44,518 --> 01:16:48,229
对我来说  行动使生活更刺激
Well, you know, for me, the action is the juice.

759
01:16:48,397 --> 01:16:49,438
我参加
I'm in.

760
01:16:53,944 --> 01:16:54,944
你呢
You too?

761
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:56,862
我会
Yeah, sure.

762
01:16:57,030 --> 01:16:58,698
动手吧
Let's go.

763
01:16:58,865 --> 01:17:00,741
去他们的  行动吧
Fuck them, let's do it.

764
01:17:00,909 --> 01:17:03,494
那好  我们有许多事要做
All right, let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

765
01:17:16,925 --> 01:17:18,843
- 你们不能进去  - 查查这个
- You can't go in there. - Watch this.

766
01:17:19,011 --> 01:17:21,178
- 抱歉  等等  - 提姆  我回头再给你打电话
- Excuse me. That... - Tim, I gotta call you back.

767
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:22,805
你得提前预约
You have to have an appointment.

768
01:17:22,973 --> 01:17:24,807
- 我能帮助你吗  - 你是马·亚伦吗
- Can I help you? - Are you Alan Marciano?

769
01:17:24,975 --> 01:17:27,435
- 是我  你他妈是谁  - 我是谁
- Yeah, and who the fuck are you? - Who am I?

770
01:17:27,602 --> 01:17:30,688
- 嘿  - 洛城警局的韩·云信探长
- Hey. Hey. - Lieutenant Vincent Hanna, L.A.P.D.

771
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:34,108
这里是赌城拉斯维加斯  不在你的管辖范围
L.A.? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.

772
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:37,778
你知道在惹恼谁吗
Hey. Hey, I don't know who the fuck you guys think you're pushing around...

773
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:43,284
- 我认识这儿的大人物  - 我可以让赌城警方拘押你
- ...but I know people here, okay? - Las Vegas P.D. takes you into custody.

774
01:17:43,910 --> 01:17:46,912
你会因从北卡罗来纳走私香烟
You are extradited to Newark on a New Jersey warrant...

775
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:50,333
而被引渡回纽华克
...for smuggling cigarettes up from North Carolina three years ago...

776
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,668
或是你可和我们合作
...or you go to work for us.

777
01:17:52,836 --> 01:17:54,628
简单明快
Cut and dried.

778
01:17:54,796 --> 01:17:57,631
- 就是这样  - 妈的
- That is it. - Oh, shit.

779
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:00,551
施·莎莲
Charlene Shiherlis.

780
01:18:00,719 --> 01:18:02,470
- 谁  - 谁
- Who? - Who?

781
01:18:03,013 --> 01:18:04,805
谁  你是猫头鹰吗
Who? What are you, a fucking owl?

782
01:18:05,182 --> 01:18:08,809
和你在电话中淫声浪语的女子
The lady you been talking dirty to on the telephone every day the last week.

783
01:18:08,977 --> 01:18:11,228
你不能把她和我扯上了
Yeah, you know what? You can't tie me to her.

784
01:18:11,396 --> 01:18:15,316
你肯定会回去新泽西的  笨蛋
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jack off.

785
01:18:15,484 --> 01:18:19,362
我为何会勾搭上那个婊子呢
Oh, man, I just... Why did I get mixed up with that bitch?

786
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:22,239
因为她的屁股很诱人
Because she got a great ass!

787
01:18:23,658 --> 01:18:26,911
你不知自己在做什么
And you got your head all the way up it.

788
01:18:27,371 --> 01:18:28,496
天啊
Jesus.

789
01:18:30,707 --> 01:18:34,668
我很凶  是吗  当我想起屁股  女人的屁股
When I think of asses, a woman's ass...

790
01:18:34,836 --> 01:18:37,171
便想起一些东西
...something comes out of me.

791
01:18:38,548 --> 01:18:40,591
- 那么  - 不要你说太多
- So? - So no big thing.

792
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:45,888
我只想知道她丈夫和他那伙人
All I want is her husband and his whole fucking crew.

793
01:18:46,056 --> 01:18:48,349
你会和泽加合作
Now, you're gonna work with Sergeant Drucker here.

794
01:18:52,813 --> 01:18:55,606
圣金文路和赫摩撒街
San Clemente Road and Hermosa.

795
01:18:55,774 --> 01:18:58,442
我们在那儿穿过栏栅
That's where we cut through the fence. That's the access.

796
01:18:58,610 --> 01:18:59,735
对
Right.

797
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:02,738
保安系统不堪一击
The security systems around here are a joke.

798
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:10,037
逃走路线一是圣云逊汤玛士桥
St. Vincent Thomas Bridge, that's Escape Route Number 1.

799
01:19:10,956 --> 01:19:14,208
路线二  是安纳咸公路往一一零号公路
Number 2, over here, Anaheim to the 110.

800
01:19:14,668 --> 01:19:15,709
- 好  - 好吗
- Good. - Okay?

801
01:19:15,877 --> 01:19:18,587
- 很好  - 明白吗  好的  走吧
- Yeah. That's fine. - Got it? Good. Let's go.

802
01:19:41,319 --> 01:19:43,571
他们回头望向
They were looking back...

803
01:19:44,072 --> 01:19:46,073
这方向
...in this direction.

804
01:19:46,408 --> 01:19:48,242
货柜设施
A container facility?

805
01:19:48,410 --> 01:19:52,955
- 什么  - 太明显了  对他们来说得益太少了
- For a cartage theft? - Too visible. Too lowball for them.

806
01:19:56,084 --> 01:19:59,086
有炼油厂和废车场
Next door's an oil refinery, over there's a scrap yard.

807
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:03,757
炼油厂发薪用支票  没有现金  废车场亦一样
Refinery only pays by check. No cash around. Same for the scrap yard.

808
01:20:07,262 --> 01:20:09,472
也许他们要偷车轮盖
Maybe they're stealing hubcaps.

809
01:20:12,726 --> 01:20:15,936
炼油厂和废车场
A refinery and a scrap yard.

810
01:20:16,271 --> 01:20:19,940
- 是什么回事  - 我们正想知道
- What the hell is going on? - That's what we're trying to figure out.

811
01:20:20,942 --> 01:20:22,943
我们以为很清楚
We thought we had it.

812
01:20:23,737 --> 01:20:24,778
这下倒糊涂了
Thought we had it.

813
01:20:34,456 --> 01:20:39,001
我知道他们在看些什么
I got an idea of what they were looking at.

814
01:20:42,547 --> 01:20:45,216
- 你们想知道吗  - 是什么
- You wanna know what they're looking at? - What?

815
01:20:46,676 --> 01:20:50,012
这人真了不起  他真行
I mean, is this guy something, or is he something?

816
01:20:51,139 --> 01:20:54,058
这伙人很棒
This crew is good.

817
01:20:55,519 --> 01:20:57,394
你们想知道吗
You know what they were looking at?

818
01:20:57,812 --> 01:20:58,979
是什么
What?

819
01:21:00,232 --> 01:21:01,899
是我们
Us.

820
01:21:02,734 --> 01:21:04,818
洛城警局
The L.A.P.D.

821
01:21:04,986 --> 01:21:07,363
是警局
The police department.

822
01:21:08,031 --> 01:21:10,157
我们给人认出了
We just got made.

823
01:21:17,624 --> 01:21:19,375
是的
Yeah.

824
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,343
好的
Okay.

825
01:21:38,103 --> 01:21:39,562
好吧  杂种
Okay, motherfucker!

826
01:22:00,458 --> 01:22:01,834
祈素交出来了吗
Kelso come through?

827
01:22:02,335 --> 01:22:05,212
交出来了  蓝图很详尽
Yeah, you can build a bank with these.

828
01:22:10,885 --> 01:22:14,054
那人姓韩  名云信
Name is Hanna. First name Vincent.

829
01:22:14,598 --> 01:22:18,601
我用五百元贿赂这警员  韩监视你一举一动
I smeared this sergeant in Vice five yards. Hanna's all over you.

830
01:22:18,977 --> 01:22:21,729
监视所有的车  米高及施的家
He's on all the work cars. Michael's house, Shiherlis'.

831
01:22:21,896 --> 01:22:24,231
没监视你  不知你晚上在哪儿
Not yours, they've been losing you at night.

832
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:28,485
他很积极  他毕业后加入陆战队
Hanna's a hot dog. Graduate school. Marine Corps.

833
01:22:28,653 --> 01:22:30,779
是劫案及凶杀组探长
Lieutenant, Robbery-Homicide, Major Crime Unit.

834
01:22:30,947 --> 01:22:34,241
拘捕过不少人  在芝加哥杀了法兰
He's taken down some heavy crews. Blew away Frankie Yonder in Chicago.

835
01:22:34,409 --> 01:22:36,660
法兰是个狂人
And he was a fucking maniac.

836
01:22:36,911 --> 01:22:41,081
他之前在毒品科工作  离婚两次
He was working Narcotics before that. Had some problems, divorced twice.

837
01:22:41,249 --> 01:22:44,251
目前的太太叫彩钿  是他鼓动严密监视的
Current wife's Justine. He's why the extra heat.

838
01:22:46,546 --> 01:22:48,422
罪案科警官
The Vice sergeant...

839
01:22:49,466 --> 01:22:51,759
说韩喜欢你
...says Hanna likes you.

840
01:22:52,427 --> 01:22:55,846
认为你是明星  行事很有技巧
Thinks you're some kind of star. You do this sharp, you do that sharp.

841
01:22:56,014 --> 01:22:58,974
他能想到这样看他有多聪明
Look how sharp this guy is to figure that.

842
01:23:00,852 --> 01:23:02,936
他像心脏病般好笑  三次婚姻
Funny as a heart attack, man. Three marriages.

843
01:23:03,104 --> 01:23:06,398
你认为他喜欢待在家吗
What the fuck do you think that means? He likes staying home?

844
01:23:06,775 --> 01:23:09,276
他是那种
Means the man is one of those guys out there...

845
01:23:09,444 --> 01:23:12,363
整晚工作的人  很投入
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

846
01:23:14,616 --> 01:23:16,867
有他和警方监视  取消劫银行吧
With this guy and this much heat, you should pass.

847
01:23:24,250 --> 01:23:25,626
值得冒险一试
It's worth the stretch.

848
01:23:26,836 --> 01:23:31,465
这人是否能抓住罪犯都无所谓  可你输不起
This guy can hit and miss. You can't miss once.

849
01:23:31,800 --> 01:23:33,634
你肯定吗
You sure?

850
01:23:34,052 --> 01:23:35,969
肯定
I'm sure.

851
01:23:41,309 --> 01:23:42,643
我们去车房吧
Let's go to the garage.

852
01:23:56,491 --> 01:23:58,158
彩钿
Justine.

853
01:24:03,498 --> 01:24:05,457
彩钿
Justine?

854
01:24:11,339 --> 01:24:13,132
我们要去哪儿
Where we going?

855
01:24:18,054 --> 01:24:21,223
- 好吧  你要去哪儿  - 外面
- Okay, where are you going? - Out.

856
01:25:19,574 --> 01:25:22,576
- 他们用什么频道  - 九号战术频道
- What are you on? - TAC 9.

857
01:25:23,997 --> 01:25:28,257
他们在四零五号公路  往机场方向北走
They're northbound out LAX on the 405. We got four ground units.

858
01:25:46,601 --> 01:25:49,311
我是十八号机的韩·云信  谁和我合作
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18. Who have I got?

859
01:25:49,646 --> 01:25:53,232
我是四十号机的JJ  高·里察和我在一起
Hey, Vincent, it's JJ. I'm in Air 40. Richard Glover's with me.

860
01:25:53,399 --> 01:25:57,569
车在一零五号公路  东行接近一一零号公路
It's on the 105 eastbound approaching the 110 interchange.

861
01:25:58,238 --> 01:26:02,616
- 是交替追踪吗  - 是的  前面有两辆车  三辆在他后面
- You running a revolving tail? - Yeah, I got two units in front, three behind.

862
01:26:02,784 --> 01:26:06,829
要其中一辆在维蒙街接我
Okay, have one of them pick me up at the Vermont on-ramp.

863
01:26:07,038 --> 01:26:08,413
走吧
Let's go.

864
01:26:58,423 --> 01:27:02,384
我离他有一百码吗   太近还是太远
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I close or far, or what?

865
01:27:02,552 --> 01:27:05,137
离他三百码  在中央行车线
Three hundred yards, center lane.

866
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:13,580
你好吗
How you doing?

867
01:28:16,751 --> 01:28:19,795
我请你喝咖啡如何
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

868
01:28:25,927 --> 01:28:29,221
- 好的  走吧  - 跟着我
- Yeah, sure. Let's go. - Follow me.

869
01:28:44,988 --> 01:28:47,447
你在霍森监狱七年
Seven years in Folsom.

870
01:28:47,615 --> 01:28:49,449
单独囚禁三年
In the hole for three.

871
01:28:49,617 --> 01:28:50,909
之前在麦尼尔监狱
McNeil before that.

872
01:28:54,497 --> 01:28:56,832
那儿是一如所说的那么凶残吗
McNeil as tough as they say?

873
01:28:57,709 --> 01:28:59,584
你想成为监狱学者吗
You looking to become a penologist?

874
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:02,200
你想再坐牢吗
You're looking to go back?

875
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:05,600
我追捕过不少把事情搞砸  只能束手被擒的人
You know, I chase down some crews guys just looking to fuck up,

876
01:29:05,700 --> 01:29:08,552
再次送回监狱  你是那种人吗
get busted back. That you?

877
01:29:09,262 --> 01:29:11,471
你拘捕的一定是饭桶笨蛋
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

878
01:29:12,265 --> 01:29:14,474
我拘捕各式各样的人
I worked all kinds.

879
01:29:17,478 --> 01:29:20,022
你幻想我身上有刺青
You see me doing thrill-seeking liquor-store holdups...

880
01:29:20,189 --> 01:29:22,524
行劫酒铺吗
...with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

881
01:29:22,692 --> 01:29:25,527
- 不  我不会的  - 对
- No, I do not. - Right.

882
01:29:26,696 --> 01:29:28,530
我不会再坐牢
I am never going back.

883
01:29:30,158 --> 01:29:32,409
那么便别再行劫
Then don't take down scores.

884
01:29:33,578 --> 01:29:36,204
我做擅长做的事  我行劫
I do what I do best, I take scores.

885
01:29:36,372 --> 01:29:40,000
你做擅长的事  阻止我
You do what you do best, trying to stop guys like me.

886
01:29:43,212 --> 01:29:46,048
你从不想过正常生活
So you never wanted a regular-type life?

887
01:29:46,215 --> 01:29:49,217
是怎样的  烧烤和踢足球吗
What the fuck is that? Barbecues and ball games?

888
01:29:50,970 --> 01:29:52,095
是的
Yeah.

889
01:29:54,557 --> 01:29:59,770
- 你的生活正常吗  - 我的生活  不  我的生活
- This regular-type life like your life? - My life? No, my life...

890
01:30:00,730 --> 01:30:02,689
一塌糊涂
No, my life's a disaster zone.

891
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:07,277
我的继女情绪深受困扰
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

892
01:30:07,445 --> 01:30:10,530
因为她的生父是个大混蛋
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.

893
01:30:10,698 --> 01:30:14,576
我有太太  我的婚姻正频临破碎边缘
I got a wife. We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage...

894
01:30:14,744 --> 01:30:16,620
第三次了
...my third...

895
01:30:18,039 --> 01:30:21,708
因为我常花时间追捕你这样的人
...because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.

896
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:23,919
那是我的生活
That's my life.

897
01:30:29,717 --> 01:30:31,968
有人曾对我说
A guy told me one time:

898
01:30:33,387 --> 01:30:35,514
若你感到附近有警方监视
Don't let yourself get attached to anything...

899
01:30:35,681 --> 01:30:38,391
便不能沾上任何不能脱身的事
...you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat...

900
01:30:38,559 --> 01:30:40,727
三十秒内  一走了之
...if you feel the heat around the corner.

901
01:30:41,771 --> 01:30:45,190
你想捉我  我行动时你亦行动
Now, if you're on me, and you gotta move when I move...

902
01:30:45,358 --> 01:30:48,527
你如何能维持婚姻呢
...how do you expect to keep a marriage?

903
01:30:50,321 --> 01:30:52,572
这说法很有趣
Well, that's an interesting point.

904
01:30:53,783 --> 01:30:55,951
你是僧侣吗
What are you, a monk?

905
01:30:56,202 --> 01:30:57,911
我有女伴
I have a woman.

906
01:30:58,079 --> 01:31:00,080
你怎么对她说
What do you tell her?

907
01:31:01,916 --> 01:31:04,042
我告诉她  我是推销员
I tell her I'm a salesman.

908
01:31:10,383 --> 01:31:13,927
那么若你见我从街角走来
So then, if you spot me coming around that corner...

909
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:17,097
你会离开她吗
...you're just gonna walk out on this woman?

910
01:31:17,890 --> 01:31:20,058
不辞而别
Not say goodbye?

911
01:31:20,309 --> 01:31:22,561
那是自律
That's the discipline.

912
01:31:22,770 --> 01:31:24,688
那很空泛
That's pretty vacant, no?

913
01:31:24,856 --> 01:31:26,523
正是如此
Yeah, it is what it is.

914
01:31:26,691 --> 01:31:29,317
不这样做  我们还是另找职业吧
It's that, or we both better go do something else, pal.

915
01:31:31,445 --> 01:31:33,238
我不懂做别的
I don't know how to do anything else.

916
01:31:33,823 --> 01:31:35,699
我也不懂
Neither do I.

917
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:41,621
- 我不想做其他事  - 我也不想
- I don't much want to either. - Neither do I.

918
01:31:49,297 --> 01:31:52,883
我不断重复这梦境
You know, I have this recurring dream.

919
01:31:53,843 --> 01:31:56,511
我坐在偌大的餐宴席上
I'm sitting at this big banquet table...

920
01:31:56,679 --> 01:32:00,557
我调查的凶案受害人均出席
...and all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting at this table...

921
01:32:00,725 --> 01:32:04,978
他们用黑色的眼珠子瞪望我
...and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...

922
01:32:05,146 --> 01:32:10,150
因为他们头部中枪而出血
...because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.

923
01:32:10,484 --> 01:32:13,987
这些发胀的尸体在那儿
And there they are, these big balloon people...

924
01:32:14,155 --> 01:32:17,240
因为他们被杀两周后才在床下发现
...because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.

925
01:32:18,075 --> 01:32:20,911
邻居报称有恶臭
The neighbors reported the smell...

926
01:32:21,454 --> 01:32:25,457
他们均有出席  所有人坐在那儿
...and there they are, all of them just sitting there.

927
01:32:27,168 --> 01:32:28,210
他们说什么
What do they say?

928
01:32:30,421 --> 01:32:31,671
没说话
Nothing.

929
01:32:31,839 --> 01:32:33,506
- 没人说话吗  - 没有
- No talk? - None.

930
01:32:33,674 --> 01:32:37,302
他们无话可说
Just... They don't have anything to say.

931
01:32:37,929 --> 01:32:40,347
我们彼此望着对方
See, we just look at each other.

932
01:32:40,806 --> 01:32:45,644
他们望着我  就是这样  梦境是这样
They look at me. And that's it, that's the dream.

933
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:50,398
我梦过自己溺水
I have one where I'm drowning.

934
01:32:50,691 --> 01:32:54,236
我得弄醒自己  开始呼吸  否则会死
And I gotta wake myself up and start breathing, or I'll die in my sleep.

935
01:32:56,447 --> 01:32:57,822
你知道这象征着什么吗
You know what that's about?

936
01:32:58,324 --> 01:33:01,034
知道  有足够的时间
Yeah. Having enough time.

937
01:33:02,578 --> 01:33:07,791
- 有足够的时间做你想做的事吗  - 是的
- Enough time to do what you wanna do? - That's right.

938
01:33:09,752 --> 01:33:13,380
- 你正在这样做吗  - 还没有
- You doing it now? - No, not yet.

939
01:33:18,261 --> 01:33:20,553
我们坐在这里
You know, we're sitting here...

940
01:33:21,597 --> 01:33:23,723
一如常人
...you and I, like a couple of regular fellows.

941
01:33:23,891 --> 01:33:26,601
彼此做有需要的事
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

942
01:33:28,896 --> 01:33:31,898
现在我们见过面
And now that we've been face to face...

943
01:33:34,193 --> 01:33:39,197
若我要在案发现场杀你  我会不喜欢的
...if I'm there and I gotta put you away, I won't like it.

944
01:33:39,573 --> 01:33:40,699
但是
But I'll tell you...

945
01:33:43,244 --> 01:33:46,746
若在你和
...if it's between you and some poor bastard...

946
01:33:46,914 --> 01:33:49,416
被你杀死的人当中作选择
...whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

947
01:33:50,251 --> 01:33:54,587
兄弟  没命的会是你
...brother, you are going down.

948
01:34:06,309 --> 01:34:09,144
我有反面的看法
There's a flip side to that coin.

949
01:34:10,938 --> 01:34:15,275
若你真的使我走投无路  而我要杀你呢
What if you do got me boxed in and I gotta put you down?

950
01:34:16,569 --> 01:34:21,281
因为无论如何  你是无法阻止我的
Because no matter what, you will not get in my way.

951
01:34:21,991 --> 01:34:24,909
是的  我们见过面
We've been face to face, yeah...

952
01:34:27,538 --> 01:34:31,624
但我会毫不犹疑杀你  一秒也不迟疑
...but I will not hesitate. Not for a second.

953
01:34:37,465 --> 01:34:39,799
也许会这样
Maybe that's the way it'll be.

954
01:34:41,635 --> 01:34:44,763
或是谁晓得呢
Or who knows?

955
01:34:44,972 --> 01:34:47,724
也许我们会永远不再见
Or maybe we'll never see each other again.

956
01:35:03,240 --> 01:35:04,783
他们摆脱了我们
They dumped us.

957
01:35:06,118 --> 01:35:07,410
什么
What?

958
01:35:07,578 --> 01:35:10,872
- 他们逃脱了  - 什么意思
- They dumped us. - What do you mean, they dumped us?

959
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,123
基斯甩掉了跟踪他的探员
Chris slipped his tail.

960
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:14,876
他没跟莎莲谈及买卖的事
He doesn't talk about scores with Charlene...

961
01:35:15,044 --> 01:35:17,629
我无从向马·亚伦套取资料
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I tried.

962
01:35:18,047 --> 01:35:20,048
- 查·米高呢  - 亦一样
- What about Cheritto? - Same.

963
01:35:20,216 --> 01:35:22,967
异频收发器放在公共汽车上
Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

964
01:35:25,388 --> 01:35:29,849
- 他们摆脱我们所有的监视了吗  - 是的  同一时间  晚上九时
- They dumped all our surveillance? - Yeah, at the same time. 9 p.m.

965
01:35:30,851 --> 01:35:34,187
我半小时前和麦·尼尔喝咖啡
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

966
01:35:34,355 --> 01:35:36,689
之后他驶往机场
We were on you. Then McCauley drives into LAX...

967
01:35:36,857 --> 01:35:39,859
我们便无法飞去
...where surveillance can't fly over because of flight paths.

968
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:43,363
他的车仍在那儿  但人走了
His car's still there. He's gone.

969
01:35:47,785 --> 01:35:53,748
有谁知道他们在哪儿吗
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

970
01:36:52,391 --> 01:36:54,100
他有联络吗
You hear from him yet?

971
01:36:54,268 --> 01:36:58,730
没有  这令我不安  他在哪儿
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more. Where's this guy?

972
01:37:00,816 --> 01:37:05,528
这人  我们雇用他  他说认识麦·尼尔
This guy here. We put him on. Says he knows McCauley.

973
01:37:10,701 --> 01:37:11,743
你是谁
Who are you?

974
01:37:12,995 --> 01:37:16,789
荣谷  我叫荣谷
Waingro. My name's Waingro.

975
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:20,543
我等他电话  你很熟识他吗
I've been living in this office day and night. How well do you know him?

976
01:37:21,295 --> 01:37:24,797
我们一起做过不少大买卖
Oh, we took some major scores together.

977
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:29,802
他为何没找我
How come I haven't heard from him?

978
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:33,806
他可能忙着  但他行事很彻底
Well, he's probably busy right now, but he's real thorough.

979
01:37:35,226 --> 01:37:39,103
- 他不会忘记你的  - 噢  那真令人安心
- He ain't gonna forget about you. - Oh, that's reassuring.

980
01:37:40,856 --> 01:37:44,025
我可在这儿出了力
Well, I got some moves I could make here.

981
01:37:44,527 --> 01:37:47,487
可能对你会很有帮助
Probably be a big help to you.

982
01:38:08,509 --> 01:38:09,842
认得那烤肉的人吗
You recognize the grill man?

983
01:38:18,018 --> 01:38:22,313
- 不认识  - 霍森监狱  D座的  和杜比同一囚室
- No. - Folsom. D-block. Housed with Dobie Rush.

984
01:38:23,732 --> 01:38:27,527
- 我还没有小休  - 薜哥和彭曹没上班
- Ain't got my break yet, man. - Cisco and Pancho didn't show.

985
01:38:27,695 --> 01:38:30,697
扔垃圾  到餐厅后抹地
Haul out the garbage. Mop up the back.

986
01:38:30,864 --> 01:38:32,824
稍后再休息吧
Take your break later.

987
01:38:32,992 --> 01:38:36,327
人渣  端菜
Piece of shit. Pick up.

988
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:40,832
他在哪儿
Where the hell is he?

989
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:44,335
- 我查看车场  看车是否仍在那儿  - 我也去
- I wanted to check the slot for a work car. - So did I.

990
01:38:49,508 --> 01:38:50,925
是我
Yeah?

991
01:38:52,136 --> 01:38:53,636
等一等
Hang on.

992
01:38:54,013 --> 01:38:55,930
- 喂  - 嘿
- Yeah. - Hey.

993
01:38:56,098 --> 01:39:00,643
用普通电话  拨号103-7206
Use a landline. Call me at 103-7206.

994
01:39:00,811 --> 01:39:02,061
好的
All right.

995
01:39:12,948 --> 01:39:15,074
- 你在哪儿  - 到处有警察监视我
- Where are you? - There's cops all over me, man.

996
01:39:15,242 --> 01:39:19,245
我无法摆脱他们
They're on me like a cheap suit. I can't dump them.

997
01:39:21,749 --> 01:39:25,710
- 他们知道你发现他们了吗  - 不  没有  他们平衡紧帖我
- After the fact you spotted them? - No, no. They're doing parallels.

998
01:39:28,589 --> 01:39:30,006
我再试试摆脱他们
I can try to dump them again.

999
01:39:30,174 --> 01:39:34,552
我怎么知道你是否摆脱了  你会引他们过来找到我们
How are we gonna know if you did? If you didn't, you'll draw them to us.

1000
01:39:34,928 --> 01:39:36,846
到宏杜拿去  引开他们
Head for Ventura. Pull them out of here.

1001
01:39:37,014 --> 01:39:41,100
好的  对不起  我真不想让你失望
All right. Hey, I'm sorry, man. Last thing I wanna do is let you down.

1002
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:05,708
快点
Come on, man.

1003
01:40:07,252 --> 01:40:08,920
端出去
Pick up.

1004
01:40:09,672 --> 01:40:12,715
- 嘿  尼尔  你好吗  - 你好吗  兄弟
- Hey, hey, Neil, man. What up? - What's up, brother?

1005
01:40:12,883 --> 01:40:15,259
你在这儿做什么
Man, what you doing here?

1006
01:40:15,427 --> 01:40:19,180
我在找能够应付警方追踪的司机
What I am doing is I'm looking for a driver who can handle scanners and a radio.

1007
01:40:19,348 --> 01:40:20,390
现在便要
Right now, today.

1008
01:40:20,557 --> 01:40:21,974
你还记得吗
You remember the drill?

1009
01:40:22,142 --> 01:40:23,518
记得
Yeah, man, sure.

1010
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:25,019
你可靠吗
You cool?

1011
01:40:25,437 --> 01:40:27,647
你知道我很可靠
Oh, man, now, you know I'm cool.

1012
01:40:27,815 --> 01:40:31,150
你现在便答覆我  肯或不肯
One answer, yes or no. Right now.

1013
01:40:44,456 --> 01:40:47,375
好的  去它的  我答应
Yeah, man. Fuck, yeah. You're on.

1014
01:40:48,711 --> 01:40:50,837
五分钟后到后面来
Out back in five.

1015
01:40:59,847 --> 01:41:02,473
- 是什么烧焦了  - 不是我干的
- What's burning? What's burning? - Nothing I'm doing.

1016
01:41:02,641 --> 01:41:04,350
是什么事
What is this?

1017
01:41:04,518 --> 01:41:06,686
你要去哪儿
Where do you think you're going?

1018
01:41:10,274 --> 01:41:13,901
刚好超过第一版的康丁斯基的色彩理论
Just came across a first edition of Kandinsky's Theory of Color.

1019
01:41:14,069 --> 01:41:16,320
是啊  情况很好
Yeah. No, it's in good condition.

1020
01:41:16,488 --> 01:41:19,824
这艘船没有停下  也没有回覆警方的喊话
And it will not stop or answer radio communication.

1021
01:41:19,992 --> 01:41:23,369
编号为一八零的这艘船被称为金银一号
The 180-foot vessel is called Jin Yin Number 1...

1022
01:41:23,537 --> 01:41:26,539
涉嫌偷渡中国非法移民
...and is suspected of smuggling Chinese illegal aliens.

1023
01:41:26,707 --> 01:41:28,708
警方的巡逻机于星期六发现了这艘可疑船只
It was spotted Saturday by patrol aircraft.

1024
01:42:41,114 --> 01:42:43,574
- 趴下  - 别动  不许动
- Stay down. - Don't move! Don't fucking move!

1025
01:42:43,742 --> 01:42:47,119
举起手来  举起你们的双手
Put your hands in the air! Put your hands in the air! Put them up!

1026
01:42:47,287 --> 01:42:50,289
趴下  两腿着地
Down, down! Get on your knees.

1027
01:42:50,457 --> 01:42:52,291
- 把钥匙给我  - 跪下
- Give me the keys. - Get on your knees.

1028

Get on your knees!

1029
01:42:57,256 --> 01:43:00,967
过去那边  趴下
Hey. Hey! Get over there. Get the fuck... Get down.

1030
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:03,636
转身  把手放在背后
Turn around! Put your hands behind you. Behind you!

1031
01:43:03,804 --> 01:43:05,763
趴下
Get down! Stay down!

1032
01:43:06,682 --> 01:43:09,684
趴下  混蛋
Get down! Get down! Down, you stupid son of a...

1033
01:43:10,686 --> 01:43:13,813
- 趴下  - 拿锁匙来
- Down! Down, now! - Keys! Keys! Keys!

1034
01:43:17,484 --> 01:43:18,818
别动
All of you stay down.

1035
01:43:19,987 --> 01:43:23,322
我们不想伤人  只要银行的钱  不是你们的钱
We want to hurt no one. We're here for the bank's money, not your money.

1036
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:25,992
你们不会损失  政府购买了保险
Your money's insured. You're not gonna lose a dime.

1037
01:43:26,159 --> 01:43:29,996
想想你的家人  别冒生命危险  别逞能
Think of your families. Don't risk your life. Don't try and be a hero.

1038
01:43:30,163 --> 01:43:33,666
我要你们都坐在地上  手放在头上
Right now I want you to sit on the floor and put your hands on your head.

1039
01:43:33,834 --> 01:43:38,337
如果感到不舒服或着心脏难受  便靠在墙上
Anybody feels sick, anybody got heart trouble, go ahead and lean against the wall.

1040
01:43:39,172 --> 01:43:41,716
- 给我锁匙  - 什么锁匙
- Give me the key. - What key?

1041
01:43:43,343 --> 01:43:46,387
坐下  别动
Get down and stay down!

1042
01:43:46,555 --> 01:43:49,181
坐着别动  让伤口流血吧
Sit there. Sit there. Don't move. Let it bleed.

1043
01:43:58,483 --> 01:44:00,192
趴下
Get down!

1044
01:44:25,552 --> 01:44:26,677
嘿
Hey. Hey!

1045
01:44:34,978 --> 01:44:37,271
把头低下
Put your head down.

1046
01:44:38,357 --> 01:44:40,691
- 再看我一眼  我就杀了你  - 趴下
- Look at me again, I'll kill you. - Stay down. Down.

1047
01:44:40,859 --> 01:44:45,196
- 把头低下  - 低头  低头
- Put your head down! - Get down. Get down.

1048
01:45:05,801 --> 01:45:07,551
- 嘿  卡索斯  - 怎么啦
- Hey, Casals. - Yeah.

1049
01:45:07,719 --> 01:45:10,096
你们在调查麦·尼尔的案子吧

1181
02:02:28,884 --> 02:02:30,051
荣谷在哪儿
Waingro, where is he?

1182
02:02:31,429 --> 02:02:33,680
- 在哪儿  - 我怎么知道
- Where is he? - How the hell would I know?

1183
02:02:59,457 --> 02:03:03,376
嗯  这儿有些什么
Well, what do we have here, hmm?

1184
02:03:03,836 --> 02:03:07,464
这儿漂亮吗  漂亮吗
Isn't this pretty? It's pretty.

1185
02:03:09,925 --> 02:03:12,969
- 你这个小人  - 你告诉我想脱离目前的困境
- You slimy piece of shit. - You told me you wanted out from under.

1186
02:03:13,137 --> 02:03:16,306
你想脱身吗  这是出路
You're scared to death, right? You want out? This is out, Charlene.

1187
02:03:16,474 --> 02:03:20,143
- 你得到什么好处啦  - 我没好处  你这个蠢娘们
- Yeah, what's your end? - I... You stupid broad.

1188
02:03:20,311 --> 02:03:22,771
- 我怎么会牵涉此事的  - 嘿  冷静  别冲动
- How'd I get into this? - Hey, hey, hey. Easy.

1189
02:03:22,938 --> 02:03:24,147
你听到我说的了
You heard me.

1190
02:03:24,315 --> 02:03:27,358
她已经够难受的了  你为何不给她倒杯酒呢
She had a rough ride. Why don't you fix her a drink or something?

1191
02:03:27,526 --> 02:03:30,528
- 到橱柜看看  - 去她的
- Look in the cabinet above the sink. - Fuck her.

1192
02:03:32,948 --> 02:03:36,076
- 你最好进去  不要出来  - 好吧
- You'd better get in there and stay in there. - All right, all right.

1193
02:03:38,829 --> 02:03:41,081
看看这儿
Well, lookie here.

1194
02:03:42,249 --> 02:03:44,542
我是泽加  洛城警局  凶杀组探员
My name is Sergeant Drucker, L.A.P.D. Homicide.

1195
02:03:44,710 --> 02:03:48,713
- 要送多明进睡房吗  - 他和我待在一起
- You wanna put Dominick in the bedroom? - He stays with me.

1196
02:03:49,215 --> 02:03:51,132
坐下
There we go.

1197
02:03:58,724 --> 02:04:00,683
现在怎么办
So, what now?

1198
02:04:02,937 --> 02:04:06,689
他说得对  你想脱身  这是出路
Well, he's right, because you want out, this is out.

1199
02:04:08,109 --> 02:04:11,986
- 你真的要出卖基斯吗  - 正是
- You believe you have to betray Chris. - No shit.

1200
02:04:12,154 --> 02:04:15,115
这就对了  你是得这样做
That's right. You would have to.

1201
02:04:15,282 --> 02:04:19,536
若不出卖基斯  多明会是受害人
See, if you don't betray Chris, you victimize Dominick.

1202
02:04:20,037 --> 02:04:23,248
因为当你入狱时  他便会成为孤儿
Because he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...

1203
02:04:23,415 --> 02:04:25,875
你也没有父母来照顾他
...because you got no living parents to take him.

1204
02:04:26,043 --> 02:04:30,421
他会被送进收养所  青少年中心
So he ends up state-raised in foster homes, juvenile facilities.

1205
02:04:30,589 --> 02:04:32,841
之后他会偷车
Then he steals a car.

1206
02:04:33,092 --> 02:04:38,263
然后入狱学会做真正的罪犯
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.

1207
02:04:38,430 --> 02:04:41,724
毁了一生
Fucked for life.

1208
02:04:41,892 --> 02:04:45,228
你是过来人  知道会有何下场
You know what happens, because you've been there.

1209
02:04:46,397 --> 02:04:51,568
多明没机会选择生活  但基斯有
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life, but Chris did.

1210
02:04:52,653 --> 02:04:56,239
你若供出基斯  你会没有案底
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1211
02:04:56,407 --> 02:05:00,326
你可以为了孩子而这样做  你可以抚养他
You can do it for your kid, so you can raise him.

1212
02:05:04,498 --> 02:05:07,876
- 你还有什么条件  - 各种各样的东西
- What else are you selling? - All kinds of shit.

1213
02:05:08,752 --> 02:05:13,965
但我不用说服你  因为我是对的
But I don't have to sell this and you know it, because this kind of shit here sells itself.

1214
02:05:20,264 --> 02:05:22,265

Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.

1224
02:06:04,683 --> 02:06:07,435
荣谷曾是他手下
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew...

1225
02:06:07,603 --> 02:06:11,189
后替洗钱人工作  他叫宏山

Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1227

Why is it that I have to figure things out and explain them to you? What do you do?

我不得不作践自己  找洛夫来终断我们的关系
Now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.

Check in with me at 9. Everything's still cool.

1305
02:12:49,713 --> 02:12:51,380
好的
All right.

1306
02:13:13,945 --> 02:13:16,906
我甚至不知道自己在做什么
I don't even know what I'm doing anymore.

1307
02:13:19,785 --> 02:13:21,994
我知道人生苦短
I know life is short.

1308
02:13:22,245 --> 02:13:24,872
能活多久是运气
Whatever time you get is luck.

1309
02:13:27,084 --> 02:13:29,168
你想终断这段关系
You wanna walk?

1310
02:13:31,421 --> 02:13:33,714
你现在就能离开
You walk right now.

1311
02:13:34,800 --> 02:13:36,926
或者你自愿
Or on your own...

1312
02:13:37,094 --> 02:13:40,137
你自愿选择跟我一起走
On your own, you choose to come with me.

1313
02:13:46,228 --> 02:13:48,270
我只知道
All I know is...

1314
02:13:50,065 --> 02:13:54,402
我无论到任何地方去  都将失去意义
All I know is there's no point in me going anywhere anymore...

1315
02:13:54,945 --> 02:13:57,029
因为只有我独自一人
...if it's gonna be alone...

1316
02:13:57,948 --> 02:13:59,740
没有你陪在身边
...without you.

1317
02:14:06,581 --> 02:14:08,165
伊荻
Eady.

1318
02:14:57,883 --> 02:15:00,342

- 快去啊  - 住口
- Yeah, do it. - Shut up!

1322
02:15:13,940 --> 02:15:16,650
只需在窗前站一秒
Now, just one second at the window...

1323
02:15:17,444 --> 02:15:19,195
此事便会了结
...and it's all over.

1324
02:17:09,180 --> 02:17:10,848
朋友
Hey, man.

1325
02:17:11,099 --> 02:17:13,058
- 干嘛  - 你知道
- Yeah? - You know any, uh...

1326
02:17:13,226 --> 02:17:16,020
这附近有地方要出租吗
...place to rent around here?

1327
02:17:17,105 --> 02:17:18,230
知道
Yeah.

1328
02:17:18,398 --> 02:17:20,983
那边墙上有告示
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue got cards on the wall.

1329
02:17:21,151 --> 02:17:22,192
好的  谢谢
Yeah, thanks.

1330
02:17:33,413 --> 02:17:36,081

It's not him. It's not Chris.

是指挥部
Unit 2, this is Command.

1332
02:17:46,051 --> 02:17:48,719
拦住他  核实他的身份
Take him at the street and check him out.

Would you like a cup of coffee while we wait, Mrs. Shiherlis?

1342

1363
02:23:02,825 --> 02:23:04,826
让我绑紧胳膊
Let me tighten this.

1364
02:23:10,333 --> 02:23:12,334
浪费生命
What a fucking waste.

1365
02:23:12,502 --> 02:23:14,836
好了  来了
Okay, here.

1366
02:23:15,672 --> 02:23:21,385
每天都有混蛋自杀  但你不是混蛋  宝贝  你不会死的
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day. Not you, baby. Not you.

1367
02:23:26,224 --> 02:23:29,685
她会在哪儿  她叫罗兰  古·罗兰
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren, Lauren Gustafson.

1368
02:23:29,852 --> 02:23:32,104
她该在这儿的
I'm supposed to be here with her. But the police...

1369
02:23:39,028 --> 02:23:42,197
- 我要人帮忙  - 没事儿的

I want you to get a trauma surgeon and a vascular surgeon.

1377
02:24:07,849 --> 02:24:11,101
她割断了两条动脉  我摸不到她的脉搏
I think she cut both arteries. Also, I could hardly feel her pulse.

1378
02:24:11,269 --> 02:24:14,604
她的血压很低  呼吸也很微弱  要给她插管
Her pressure's down. So is her respiration. You have to intubate her.

1379
02:24:14,772 --> 02:24:16,481
准备好了
It's ready.

1380
02:24:17,984 --> 02:24:21,153
- 最后一次见她时是什么时候  - 我不知道
- When's the last time anybody saw her? - I don't know.

1381
02:24:21,321 --> 02:24:24,406
- 你在哪儿找到她的  - 浴缸
- Where did you find her? - The bathtub.

1382
02:24:24,574 --> 02:24:28,118
给她注射大针管的盐水
Call Respiratory stat. Give her large-bore normal saline. Wide open.

1383
02:24:28,286 --> 02:24:31,413
紧按出血的血管  先输入两个单位O型血
Let's keep pressure on those bleeders. I need two units, O-negative.

1384
02:24:31,581 --> 02:24:34,624
- 查明血型后再输入六个单位相同的  - 看来她已经窦性心律过速
- Let's type and cross her for six. - Looks like she's in sinus tach.

1385
02:24:34,792 --> 02:24:36,668
呼吸专家呢  我们需要帮忙
Where is Respiratory? We need more help.

1386
02:24:36,836 --> 02:24:38,628
快叫呼吸科医生过来
Can you have Respiratory come now?

1387

准备插管后照X光
Let's have x-ray ready for post-intubation chest x-ray.

Hi. Your daughter's out of surgery and she's in the recovery room now, okay?

Her vital signs are stable. The surgeon will be out to speak to you in a few moments.

- 她没事吧  - 她很好
- She's okay? - She's doing good.

1391
02:24:57,690 --> 02:24:59,858
- 她会好起来的  - 她会好起来的
- She's gonna be okay. - She's gonna be okay.

1392

- 噢  我的宝贝  - 她会好起来的  没事了
- Oh, my baby. - She's gonna be okay. It's all right.

1393
02:25:03,071 --> 02:25:06,198
- 没事了  - 她为何这样对待自己
- It's all right. - Why'd she do this to herself? Why?

1394
02:25:06,366 --> 02:25:10,577
看她把自己怎么了
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

1395
02:25:11,621 --> 02:25:13,455
好了
There.

1396
02:25:13,873 --> 02:25:16,792
没事的  不会有事的
It's all right, honey. It's gonna be all right.

1397
02:25:16,959 --> 02:25:19,002
我在这儿  不会到别处去
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1398
02:25:19,170 --> 02:25:20,212
- 明白吗  - 嗯
- You understand? - Yeah.

1399
02:25:20,380 --> 02:25:22,464
我不会到别处去
I ain't going anywhere.

1400
02:25:35,269 --> 02:25:36,269
喂
Yeah?

1401
02:25:36,771 --> 02:25:37,771
是我
It's me.

1402
02:25:38,356 --> 02:25:41,608
飞机已在半空  你得准时到达
Plane's in the air now. It'll be right on time.

1403
02:25:41,818 --> 02:25:45,821
可信任的司机仍找不到
On the driver's end, I still can't find nobody, so that's in the trust.

1404
02:25:45,988 --> 02:25:47,864
还有一事
One other thing.

1405
02:25:48,324 --> 02:25:49,908
你问过我  所以我得告诉你
You asked, so I gotta tell you.

1406
02:25:50,743 --> 02:25:53,620
你找的人在候爵酒店  化名詹美臣
The guy you wanted checked into the Marquis under "Jameson"...

1407
02:25:53,788 --> 02:25:57,165
我看你不想找他了吧
...if you still give a shit, which I figured you wouldn't.

1408
02:25:57,333 --> 02:26:01,086
- 你说得对  - 那么  再见  兄弟
- You figured right. - So, so long, brother.

1409
02:26:02,797 --> 02:26:04,756

你自由了
You're home free.

1411
02:26:08,261 --> 02:26:10,220
你也保重
Take it easy.

1412
02:26:20,565 --> 02:26:23,316
- 什么事  - 没事
- What is it? - Nothing.

1413
02:26:23,484 --> 02:26:25,026
自由了
Home free.

1414
02:27:02,982 --> 02:27:05,901
- 我得解决一些事情  - 还有时间吗
- I gotta take care of something. - Is there time?

1415
02:27:06,903 --> 02:27:08,570
有的
There's time.

1416
02:27:36,974 --> 02:27:40,101
我很快回来  让车子开动吧
I'll be right back. Just leave her running.

1417
02:28:21,519 --> 02:28:23,979
- 入住登记处  - 我是房间餐饮部
- Registration. - Yeah, this is Room Service.

1418
02:28:24,146 --> 02:28:27,983
詹美臣要了食物  但房号弄错了  你能告诉我吗
A Jameson ordered a BLT. They screwed up his room number. Could you give it to me?

1419
02:28:28,150 --> 02:28:30,026
- 他们经常会弄错  - 我知道
- They're always doing that. - Yeah, I know.

1420
02:28:30,194 --> 02:28:33,280

- 1735. - Thank you.

1421
02:30:16,759 --> 02:30:18,468
请注意
Your attention, please.

1422
02:30:18,636 --> 02:30:21,888
现在响起火警警报
We are currently experiencing a fire alarm.

1423
02:30:22,056 --> 02:30:25,433
不用惶恐  不要乘坐升降机
Please do not panic. Please do not take the elevators.

1424
02:30:29,438 --> 02:30:32,065
该死  荣谷没走  我留在这儿
Shit. Waingro's not moving. I'm staying here.

1425
02:30:32,233 --> 02:30:35,819
我查看楼梯  若有烟  便会要你走
I'm checking the stairs. If there's smoke, I'm pulling you out.

1426
02:30:40,116 --> 02:30:42,534
我该通知她父亲吗
What about her dad? You want me to call him?

1427
02:30:43,536 --> 02:30:46,371
他在内华达山脉某处
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1428
02:30:47,832 --> 02:30:49,999
她选择了你
And she chose you.

1429
02:30:52,002 --> 02:30:54,379
选择在你的房间自杀
She picked your place.

1430
02:30:55,923 --> 02:30:57,403
这样做是不对的  不该发生在她身上
It's not right, what happened to her.

1431
02:30:59,051 --> 02:31:00,385
是的
No, it's not.

1432
02:31:03,806 --> 02:31:05,849
好了
Ugh, okay.

1433
02:31:16,026 --> 02:31:18,153
是否有方法
Is there any way...

1434
02:31:20,114 --> 02:31:22,615
能克服我们之间的问题
...that it could work out between us?

1435
