47
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,738
在你爸爸到之前，我們一起找就能找到
Before Daddy comes, we can find them if we look together.

48
00:06:48,808 --> 00:06:51,438
沒事的，寶貝，沒問題的
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

你們幾個總是一起幹？
You guys always work together?

56
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:54,578
一直如此
All the time.

57
00:07:54,908 --> 00:07:56,308
真是牢固的團隊？
Real tight crew, ah?

58
00:07:56,448 --> 00:07:57,568
確實
Real tight.

00:07:58,648 --> 00:08:02,108
如果這回不錯的話，我會考慮再干的，明白嗎
If this works good, I'd consider going again, you know.

60
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:04,918
好的，別說話了，行麼，滑頭？
Yeah. Stop talking, okay, Slick?

61
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:16,868
他準備得怎樣？
How's he doing?

都好了
Hundred percent.

按預定時間
Right on schedule.

64
00:08:21,298 --> 00:08:23,238
到了威尼斯大道往右轉

好
Okay.

00:08:50,768 --> 00:08:53,788
剛剛穿過第一條車道，現在距離你三百碼

想幹我？

85
00:12:30,078 --> 00:12:32,178
你他媽在幹什麼？ 他怎麼你了？

86
00:12:32,248 --> 00:12:33,718
他動了一下
He was making a move.

87
00:12:43,298 --> 00:12:44,658

你盜了他的不記名債券
You ripped off his bearer bonds.

100
00:14:10,518 --> 00:14:11,708
他有保險
He got insurance.

101
00:14:12,748 --> 00:14:15,828
這就是重點  他能拿到百分百的保險賠償
That's the point. He collects 100 percent from the insurance.

102
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:18,528
他是個玩家  也許他向我們買回他的債券…
He's a player. Maybe he buys his bonds back from us...

103
00:14:18,628 --> 00:14:22,698
六折價購回債券，在保險完全賠償之上再賺四成
for 60 percent of their value. Makes 40 percent on top of the 100 percent.

104
00:14:24,598 --> 00:14:27,758
賣回給他，你還能拿32萬
Sell it back to him, that's an extra $320,000 to you.

00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,048
他策劃了一次行動，想要你看看
A score he's putting out, he wants you to look at.

109
00:14:36,438 --> 00:14:38,548
我不需要他的行動，我自己有買賣
I don't need his score. I got my own.

110
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:41,018

113
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,888
別問
Don't ask.

114
00:15:22,258 --> 00:15:24,328
- 找到救護車了嗎？
- 被遺棄在距離這裏四條街的位置
- Find the ambulance? - Dumped it four blocks from here.

115
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:26,688
- 在菲格羅阿和弗勞爾之間的22街
- 22nd Street between Figueroa and Flower.

116
00:15:27,788 --> 00:15:30,068
他們燃了火  燒掉了槍支、衣物，所有東西
They torched it. Burned the guns, clothes, everything.

117
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:31,698
調查仍在現場進行...

你要接手這案嗎，警督？

122
00:15:47,278 --> 00:15:49,188
還是留給分局？
Or does it stay in Division?

123
00:15:50,348 --> 00:15:53,808
你覺得這像是少年犯罪團伙搶劫7-11便利店嗎？
Does this look like gangbangers working the local 7-11 to you?

124
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,858
搶劫及兇殺部門會接手這案子
Robbery-Homicide's taking it.

125
00:15:56,058 --> 00:15:59,788
有三個汽車司機  他們都只看見戴面罩的人  他們距離遠
We got three motorists. All they saw were men with masks. They were distant.

126
00:15:59,928 --> 00:16:03,298
電視控制台那邊的人，他靠得近些
Console TV man over there, however, he was closer.

127
00:16:04,498 --> 00:16:06,238
他認出人了嗎？

128
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,778
他躲起來了，只聽見聲音
Well, He was hiding. He heard it mostly.

129
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,738
他們呢？
What about them?

130
00:16:13,468 --> 00:16:16,748
根據電視台那邊的說法，這人開始頂嘴
Right. Now, According to TV man, this guy started mouthing off.

131
00:16:17,248 --> 00:16:17,948
聰明
Smart.

132
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:19,518
有人叫一個警衛「滑頭」
Somebody called a guard "Slick."

133
00:16:19,518 --> 00:16:21,318
- 滑頭？
- 是的

134

139
00:16:33,088 --> 00:16:37,868
這人看起來是胸骨遭到雙發射擊造成的傷口
This guy here has got what appears to be a double tap-entry wound to the sternum.

140
00:16:38,328 --> 00:16:43,178
頭部傷口形成的紋路，灼焦的骨頭，近距離  可能是處決
Tattooing around the head wound, scorched bones, close range.Probably executed.

141
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:47,208
160萬的不記名債券
It was a million six in bearer bonds.

142
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:49,118
他們放棄了零散現金
They ignored the loose cash.

143
00:16:49,178 --> 00:16:51,918
因為他們沒時間，他們是有計時的準備
'Cause they had no time. They were on a clock.

144
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:54,948
意味著他們知道我們對211的反應時間
Which means they knew our response time to a 211.

145
00:16:55,018 --> 00:16:57,688
聽我們的廣播，把車截停，進入…
had our air, immobilized it, entered...

146
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:00,688
逃走，在三分鐘以內
...escaped in under three minutes.

147
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:03,628
這是個作案的好地點，有上佳的逃跑路線
It's a good spot here. We got good escape routes.

148
00:17:03,758 --> 00:17:05,028
兩條高速公路…
Two freeways...

149
00:17:05,088 --> 00:17:06,668
在四分一英里之內
within a quarter of a mile.

150
00:17:06,758 --> 00:17:08,028
交通攝像機呢？
Traffic video camera?

151
00:17:08,428 --> 00:17:10,498
可能給弄壞了，還是先查一下
Probably disabled. Check it anyway.

152
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:12,128
你認得出作案手法嗎？
You recognize the M. O?

153
00:17:10,568 --> 00:17:13,388
M. O: modus operandi 犯罪手法

154
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,398
手法…
M. O...

155
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,298
就是他們很專業
is that they're good.

156
00:17:15,398 --> 00:17:19,808
事況在當時惡化成一級謀殺罪  殺了兩個警衛後…
Once it escalated into a murder-one beef for all of them, after they killed the first two guards.

157
00:17:19,808 --> 00:17:20,878
他們沒有遲疑
they didn't hesitate.

158
00:17:20,938 --> 00:17:25,088
立馬崩了第三名警衛，因為... 這樣還有什麼區別呢？
Popped guard number three because... what difference does it make?

159
00:17:25,548 --> 00:17:27,318
為何還要留下一個活生生的目擊證人呢？
Why leave a living witness?

160
00:17:27,448 --> 00:17:30,388
瞬間這些人就坐立不安要掀房頂了
Drop of a hat, these guys will rock-and-roll.

161
00:17:33,388 --> 00:17:35,028
成型裝藥定向破門彈（定向炸藥）
The shape charge.

162
00:17:35,418 --> 00:17:39,098
從炸藥可以看出他們可是技術專家
The shape charge indicates that they are technically proficient.

163
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,968
能大膽在運輸途中犯案
Proficient enough to go in on the prowl.

164
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:44,968
著手查詢一下最近棘手的盜竊重案
So let's start looking for recent high-line burglaries that mystify us.

165
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:48,608
去找FBI查找「滑頭」的別名，你會得到一長串電話名單
Run "Slick" as an alias to the FBI. You're gonna get the phone book.

166
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:51,578
還是去查一查   誰負責轉移不記名債券？
Do it anyway. Who's moving the bearer bonds?

167
00:17:52,938 --> 00:17:56,548
查查銷贓慣犯，你和我查庫澤馬諾和特瑞納
Check the usual fences. You and I will check Cuzomano and Torena.

168
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:59,048
我要你查高斯汀和阿爾法羅
I want you to take Goldstein and Alfaro.

169
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:00,618
和法醫部門保持聯絡
Hang in with Forensics.

170
00:18:00,778 --> 00:18:03,448
我要你們從防爆小組那裏查出這爆炸物
From the bomb squad, I want the explosive.

171
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:06,488
運氣好，是別國產品的話，我們就能查出銷路來源
If we're lucky, it's exotic. We can trace the sale.

172
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:10,758
把手從那人的口袋裏抽出來,瑞秋
Get your hand out of that man's pocket, Rachel.

173
00:18:18,828 --> 00:18:20,368
有人要餡餅嗎？
Anyone want some pie?

174
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:31,608
我去上個廁所
Gotta go to the john.

175
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:06,258
我不得不開槍  他有動了  我沒法
I had to get it on. He was making a move. I had to get it on.

176
00:19:19,828 --> 00:19:22,998
錢分好了在車上  我從每人款項裏勻了同樣的錢出來
Split's in the car. I took out of ours evenly...

177
00:19:24,268 --> 00:19:26,368
來補上他的餘款
to make up for his full end.

178
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:31,168
因為我想立馬付完錢就讓這龜孫子滾蛋
'cause I want to pay off and get rid of this motherfucker right now.

179
00:20:10,038 --> 00:20:10,948
慢著！
Hold it!

180
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:52,418
其餘的錢呢？
Where's the rest?

181
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:55,288
我們晚了  你這麼美我可捨不得你出門
We're late. You look too good to go out.

182
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,558
我要鑽進你懷裏
I could just jump you right here.

183
00:22:01,058 --> 00:22:03,728
- 錢在哪兒？
- 給賭馬經紀加注去了，寶貝
- Where is it? - Squared the bookies, baby.

184
00:22:03,928 --> 00:22:07,268
幾天後還會有更多的錢，別再逼問了  我們遲到了
There's more in a couple of days, so don't sweat it. We're late.

185
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:08,268
是嗎，得了吧
Yeah, come on.

186
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,028
你在跟我開玩笑
You gotta be kidding me.

187
00:22:11,868 --> 00:22:12,468
親愛的…
Honey...

188
00:22:12,568 --> 00:22:17,708
為了8千元冒這些險根本不值得  回報與風險應該同比
it ain't worth the risks you take for $8,000. Like in "Risk versus reward."

189
00:22:17,908 --> 00:22:18,848
我們走吧
Let's go.

190
00:22:19,068 --> 00:22:20,448
去穿好外衣
Get your coat.

191
00:22:22,408 --> 00:22:25,548
白費口舌，你就是個年紀大點兒的孩子罷了
There is no point talking. You're a child growing older.

192
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:27,268
那是什麼意思？
What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:22:27,278 --> 00:22:31,558
意思是我們毫無進展，不像普通成年人那樣生活
It means We're not making forward progress like real grown-up adults living our lives.

194
00:22:31,668 --> 00:22:34,158
是因為我嫁給了一個油鹽不進的賭棍
because I married a gambling junkie who won't listen.

195
00:22:34,188 --> 00:22:36,028
莎琳，你快他媽給我上車
Charlene, get in the fucking car.

196
00:22:37,758 --> 00:22:40,368
我處這種狗屎情形之下是為了幹嗎？
What am I doing in this rat-bastard situation?

197
00:22:40,768 --> 00:22:41,058
你不必！
You're not!

198
00:22:41,098 --> 00:22:42,188
你到底要我怎樣？
What you want for me?

199
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:45,538
你出門的時候把存折和車鑰匙留在廚房嗎？
leave the bank book and the car keys in the kitchen on your way out the door?

200
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:49,568
- 我們一起走嗎，還是我一個人去？
- 留著你那廢話吧，多米尼克要跟我過
- Are we going , or am I going alone? - Keep that other crap but Dominick would go with me.

201
00:22:51,608 --> 00:22:53,348
想都別想…
Don't even think about...

202
00:23:17,998 --> 00:23:20,438
是  告訴我阿爾伯特·特瑞納回電話了
Yeah. Tell me Albert Torena called back.

203
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:23,578
阿爾伯特·特瑞納給文森特打過電話嗎？

204
00:23:23,608 --> 00:23:24,378

00:23:24,908 --> 00:23:25,878

No.

206

報告來了
Report came in.

207
00:23:27,518 --> 00:23:30,818
爆炸物是直線型填裝炸藥，用作拆毀
The explosive was Dy-Ex, linear-shaped charge used in demolition.

208
00:23:31,008 --> 00:23:34,788
憑借駕照就能在內華達、亞利桑拿和新墨西哥州買到
You can pick it up with a driver's license in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico.

209
00:23:35,018 --> 00:23:36,818
太普通難以追查來源
Too common to trace a sale.

210
00:23:37,148 --> 00:23:38,788
真是好極了
That's wonderful.

211
00:23:59,068 --> 00:23:59,968
你沒事吧？
You all right?

212
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,778

工作

蘿倫的父親來了嗎？

215
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:13,188
沒來電話也沒出現，我們等你直到10:30
Didn't call didn't show. We waited for you till 10:30.

216
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:18,468
這人知不知道這孩子的情況？
Now, does this guy have any idea what's going on with this kid?

217
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,198
我不知道
I don't know.

218
00:24:23,198 --> 00:24:24,668
他媽的混蛋
Fucking jerk.

219
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:27,638
她還好嗎？
Is she okay?

220
00:24:28,698 --> 00:24:30,808
她整天待在房間裏
She's been in her room all day.

221
00:24:30,968 --> 00:24:33,608
所以，不，她不好  我也不好
So, no, she's not okay. Neither am I.

222

223
00:24:36,078 --> 00:24:38,058
為我兩，四小時前做的

00:24:38,408 --> 00:24:42,848
每一次我嘗試在我們之間維持長久的情感關係
Every time I try to maintain a consistent mood between us.

225
00:24:42,918 --> 00:24:44,288
你就退卻
you withdraw.

226
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:48,928
有三具躺在人行道上的屍體…

How long you been here?

272
00:28:15,158 --> 00:28:16,568
大約一年
About a year.

273
00:28:17,628 --> 00:28:18,508
喜歡這兒嗎？
You like it?

274
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:23,338
不太喜歡，來這兒主要是為了工作
Not really. I'm mostly here for the work.

275
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,748
住在附近？
Live in this neighborhood?

276
00:28:32,808 --> 00:28:36,618
不，我住在...日落廣場上面附近
No, I live kind of above Sunset Plaza.

277
00:28:37,118 --> 00:28:40,088
實際上是...是我租的一所小房子
It's actually kind of a...it's a little house I rent.

278
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:44,258
稍有些破舊，但能望見很美的風景
And it's kind of rundown, but a beautiful, beautiful view.

279
00:28:45,298 --> 00:28:46,528
你呢？
What about you?

280
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,868
我住在這兒
I live up here.

281
00:28:48,258 --> 00:28:49,668
很有趣
That's very funny.

282
00:28:53,768 --> 00:28:56,208
你的家族源於哪兒？
Where's your family from originally?

283
00:28:58,468 --> 00:29:00,378
蘇格蘭-愛爾蘭
They're Scots-lrish.

284
00:29:01,208 --> 00:29:06,478
他們移民到阿帕拉契亞...16世紀晚期
They emigrated to Appalachia...in the late 1700s.

285
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:09,728
你從哪兒來？
Where are you from?

286
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:11,788
灣區（舊金山）
The Bay area.

287
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,628
家人在那裏？
Your folks there?

288
00:29:17,658 --> 00:29:20,138
母親很久前死了，我父親…
My mother died a long time ago, and my father...

289
00:29:20,228 --> 00:29:21,828
我不知他在哪兒
I don't know where he is.

290
00:29:21,898 --> 00:29:23,568
我還有個兄弟在某個地方
Got a brother somewhere.

291
00:29:29,398 --> 00:29:31,498
你和家人之間關係很牢固，我能看得出
You have a tight family. I can tell.

292
00:29:31,998 --> 00:29:32,678
是啊
Yeah.

293
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,808
對嗎？
Right?

294
00:29:34,068 --> 00:29:35,318
你說得對
You're right.

295
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,758
光明之城
City of lights...

296
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,798
在斐濟，有一種…
In Fiji, they have these...

297
00:29:51,898 --> 00:29:55,608
閃著光的海藻，每年浮出水面一次
...iridescent algae that come out once a year in the water.

298
00:29:56,758 --> 00:29:58,968
那邊就是描述的這樣美
That's what it looks like out there.

299
00:30:00,248 --> 00:30:01,508
你去過？
You been there?

300
00:30:02,838 --> 00:30:04,778
沒有，總有一天會去的
No, I'm going there some day.

301
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:15,218
你常旅遊？
You travel a lot?

302
00:30:18,178 --> 00:30:18,988
是的
Yeah.

303
00:30:19,608 --> 00:30:21,358
旅行讓你寂寞了？
Travelling makes you lonely?

304
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:28,468
我獨身，但不…
I'm alone. I am not...

305
00:30:28,908 --> 00:30:30,198
不寂寞
lonely.

306
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,598
你呢？
You?

307
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,608
真心寂寞
Real lonely.

308
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:40,828
阿爾伯特！
Albert!

309
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:44,468
糟糕！
Shit!

310
00:32:44,498 --> 00:32:45,468
阿爾伯特
Al-bert

311
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:47,868
文森，老兄你來這找我幹嘛？瘋了嗎？
Vinsen, man, why are you here for me? You crazy?

312
00:32:47,968 --> 00:32:51,408
- 這裏不是迪士尼樂園
- 你昨晚該回我電話的
-This ain't Disneyland. -You were supposed to get back to me last night.

313
00:32:51,568 --> 00:32:53,408
你他媽去哪兒了？
Where the fuck you been?

314
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:56,008
我抽不出身來，文森，你知道的
I couldn't break free, Vinsen, you know.

315
00:32:56,078 --> 00:32:58,148
現在我們來侵犯他的狗屁民權吧
Let's violate his ass right now.

316
00:32:58,308 --> 00:32:59,808
我幫忙你…
I do for you...

317
00:33:00,078 --> 00:33:02,488
你卻不幫我，是這樣嗎？
...you don't do for me, is that it?

318
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:07,698
聽著，兄弟，我發誓，我整晚在外面  像個鬥牛士一樣打鬥
Listen, man. I swear, I was out all night. I'm hitting like one of them flamingo-matador guys.

319
00:33:07,748 --> 00:33:09,648
此事和我毫無關係
That's got nothing to do with me.

320
00:33:09,668 --> 00:33:14,278
我幹得挺順的  正給你搞些線索什麼的
I was cutting it real smooth. I'm generating leads and shit for you.

321
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:15,878
- 你知道我很賣力的，老兄
- 狗屎
- I'm a dancer, man, you know. - You bullshit.

322
00:33:16,598 --> 00:33:19,098
我一整天傳呼你個屁人，我可受不了他媽的傳呼人
I paged your ass all day. I can't stand fucking paging.

323
00:33:19,168 --> 00:33:21,768
你個癮君子，又注射冰毒了
You're a speed freak, jacking methamphetamine again.

324
00:33:21,838 --> 00:33:24,778
老兄，你的同情心呢？這是濫用藥物問題
Where's your empathy? It's a substance abuse problem.

325
00:33:24,838 --> 00:33:28,508
同情心留在昨天  今天你他媽在浪費我的時間
Empathy was yesterday. Today you're wasting my motherfucking time.

326
00:33:28,678 --> 00:33:30,578
- 文森．．．
- 你戀愛了？
-Vinsen...  -You fall in love?

327
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:32,768
說吧  你昨晚是不是戀愛去了…
Come on. Did you fall in love last night...

328
00:33:33,648 --> 00:33:35,188
- 然後到別處去？
- 文森
- and went off somewhere? - Vinsen

329
00:33:35,188 --> 00:33:37,778
告訴我好了，我會接受的  我會買賬
Just tell me that, I'll settle for it. I'll buy then.

330
00:33:39,788 --> 00:33:41,258
把你弄到的消息都給我！
Give me all you got!

331
00:33:41,458 --> 00:33:43,188
都給我！
Give me all you got!

332
00:33:43,858 --> 00:33:47,128
我發誓，老兄，我哥哥理查德會跟你說的
I swear, man. My brother Richard's going to talk to you.

333
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,958
我聽見理查德？
I heard Richard?

334
00:33:49,658 --> 00:33:51,528
- 他會和你說的
- 理查德？
-He's going to talk to you. -Richard?

335
00:33:51,538 --> 00:33:52,598
- 理查德
- 理查德？
-Richard. -Richard?

336
00:33:52,598 --> 00:33:54,888
他會見你，老兄  我發誓，就在今晚
He's gonna meet you, man. I swear, tonight.

337
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:56,398
他人不在這兒，不是嗎？
He's not here, is he?

338
00:33:56,468 --> 00:33:57,948
是不在，但他今晚會見你
No, he'll meet you tonight.

339
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:59,568
今晚？現在不行嗎？
Tonight? What happened to now?

340
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:03,948
我求過他了，因為我知道你今早會來
I implored him because I knew you was coming this a.m.

341
00:34:03,978 --> 00:34:04,688
鬼扯
Bullshit.

342
00:34:04,878 --> 00:34:06,788
我發誓  他說不行…
I swear. He said no...

343
00:34:07,308 --> 00:34:08,808
因為他在鳳凰城
'cause he in Phoenix.

344
00:34:08,848 --> 00:34:11,788
「等我到了鳳凰城
"By the time I get to Phoenix

345
00:34:12,388 --> 00:34:14,088
他會起程
"He'll be rising

346
00:34:15,718 --> 00:34:17,778
他或留張字條
"He'll probably leave a note

347
00:34:17,888 --> 00:34:19,488
貼在門上」
"Right on the door"

348
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:21,728
我最多只能給你安排在今晚
Tonight's the best I can do for you.

349
00:34:22,358 --> 00:34:27,168
他在阿爾瓦拉多街BJ夜總會見你
You know. He'll meet you at BJ's on Alvarado.

350
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:29,338
凌晨兩點
At 2:00 a.m.

351
00:34:29,668 --> 00:34:30,508
到哪兒去
Be there.

352
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,168
你也要到場
You be there too.

353
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:34,118
文森，我不能去，老兄  我有事要辦
Vinsen, I can't be there, man. I got things to do.

354
00:34:34,118 --> 00:34:38,118
我有事辦，要去別地兒
I got things to do, I got places to be.

355
00:34:39,408 --> 00:34:40,518
給我去
Be there.

356
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:49,258
別他媽浪費我的時間！
Don't waste my motherfucking time!

357
00:34:53,028 --> 00:34:54,198
是什麼？
What is it?

358
00:34:55,988 --> 00:34:57,198
是一家銀行
It's a bank.

359
00:34:57,698 --> 00:35:01,138
它星期四會存現金，以便分發各分行…
It depos cash on Thursday for distribution to all the other branches...

360
00:35:01,198 --> 00:35:03,298
應付星期五的薪金支票
...to cover Friday payroll checks.

361
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,608
所以星期四總行庫存豐沛
So on Thursdays, the command branch has got a full whack.

362
00:35:06,708 --> 00:35:08,238
在途中還是硬來？
On the prowl or strong?

363
00:35:08,308 --> 00:35:09,378
硬來  由正門
Strong. Through the door.

364
00:35:09,438 --> 00:35:10,778
多少人？
How many guys?

365
00:35:10,938 --> 00:35:14,668
大約四或三個，加上一個司機  你走進去，搞定他們，走出來
About four, or three, plus a driver. You walk in, knock 'em over, walk out.

366
00:35:14,678 --> 00:35:18,078
你要預支十萬，事成後分一成？
You want $100,000 in advance against a ten-percent cut for that?

367
00:35:18,788 --> 00:35:20,558
聽著倒像是牛仔的計劃舉動
Sounds like a cowboy score.

368
00:35:20,718 --> 00:35:24,328
他們按響劫案警報器，我得在警察出現前離開，這算什麼？
They hit the hold-up alarms, I gotta get out before the cops show. What is that?

369
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:27,468
他們可以啟動三個劫案警報器
They hit three hold-up alarm systems.

370
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:29,568
兩個固定的和一個移動的
Two Telco and a cellular.

371
00:35:31,568 --> 00:35:34,308
訊號傳不出去，因為…
See but the signals aren't going anywhere because...

372
00:35:34,628 --> 00:35:36,238
前一晚…
...the night before...

373
00:35:36,468 --> 00:35:37,808
你潛進去…
...you cut in...

374
00:35:37,968 --> 00:35:40,578
修改警報系統的電腦…
...and trick out the alarm system computer...

375
00:35:40,738 --> 00:35:42,078
把它…
...to turn itself...

376
00:35:42,138 --> 00:35:44,248
和錄像設備關掉了…
...and the video recorders off...

377
00:35:44,578 --> 00:35:46,558
在你下手前20分鐘
20 minutes before you enter.

378
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:49,148
建築及電路藍圖？
Architectural, electrical plans?

379
00:35:49,318 --> 00:35:50,318
我拿到了
I got that.

380
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:53,398
我已經讓人做好主板，接駁中央處理器
I got the boards already built. They go into the CPU.

381
00:35:54,758 --> 00:35:56,228
估價是多少？
What's the estimate?

382
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,328
1210萬到1220萬
12.1, 12.2 million.

383
00:36:04,868 --> 00:36:05,928
你說服我了
You're on.

384
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:08,338
恭喜
Congratulations.

385
00:36:08,668 --> 00:36:12,308
我來給你展示下這筆錢怎麼估出來的
Let me give you a little idea of where my estimates come from.

386
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,178
沒人知道貨是你的
Nobody knew the merch was yours.

387
00:36:15,308 --> 00:36:18,878
我的辦法，你從保險公司得到百分百賠償
Be that as it may, My way, you get 100 percent from the insurance company

388
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:20,388
然後從我們這拿回債券
and take the bonds back from us.

389
00:36:20,408 --> 00:36:24,018
以美元支付的60%，而你自己再賺40%
at 60 cents on the dollar and make yourself another 40 percent.

390
00:36:26,018 --> 00:36:28,658
這運作沒漏下一個環節  咱們都明白
The operation doesn't skip a beat. We all make out.

391
00:36:29,858 --> 00:36:31,298
當然，你的交易成了
Sure, you got a deal.

392
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:35,238
好，要是每個人都不清楚分工的話何談利益呢
Good, because there's no percentage if everyone gets their underwear in a twist.

393
00:36:35,328 --> 00:36:38,898
對  讓你的人給我打電話，我們安排會面
Yeah. so you have your man call me and we'll set the meet.

394
00:36:39,098 --> 00:36:40,238
好，沒問題
Yeah, okay.

395
00:36:41,028 --> 00:36:42,508
很高興和你交談
Nice talking to you.

396
00:36:43,468 --> 00:36:45,238
你要和這些人交易？
You gonna deal with these guys?

397
00:36:45,308 --> 00:36:48,218
道上的說法 我可以偷自己的東西嗎？
Word's on the street it's okay to steal my stuff.

398
00:36:48,478 --> 00:36:50,048
我會殺了這班婊子養的
I'm going to kill these sons of bitches.

399
00:36:50,678 --> 00:36:54,648
讓哈利把加那利群島海外公司的電子錶格給我
Have Harry bring me the spreadsheets for Canary Island's Offshore.

400
00:36:59,318 --> 00:37:02,108
這些並不算是估計  是實在數字
That's not really an estimate. Those are exact figures.

401
00:37:02,148 --> 00:37:05,328
我有銀行過去兩月現金流動的打印本
I have a printout of the bank's cash flow for the past two months.

402
00:37:05,388 --> 00:37:07,268
你怎麼得到的資料？
How'd you get this information?

403
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:08,698
送上門的

Now, if he'd have said nothing, I'd have thought nothing,

524
00:47:11,358 --> 00:47:14,998

but he goes on and on, running down to me how he ain't done nothing...

525
00:47:15,068 --> 00:47:17,878

and nothing's been going on and all this bullshit.

526
00:47:17,938 --> 00:47:19,938
所以就在那會兒我就知道…
Right then and there I know...

他可把眼瞼向外翻…

母親及兄弟姐妹，我猜
Mother and siblings, I guess.

669
01:00:14,938 --> 01:00:15,918
他們來幹什麼鬼？
What the hell are they doing here?

670
01:00:15,918 --> 01:00:19,548
已經一團亂了  內部有人認識這女孩，通知了家人
Because it's fucked up. Somebody inside knew the girl and called the family.

671
01:00:20,678 --> 01:00:21,848
好吧，我們開始
Okay, let's go.

01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:27,688
不錯
Nice.

673
01:00:28,588 --> 01:00:32,558
直覺告訴我，化驗精液會發現是同一個人做的…
My intuition says the check on the semen will show it's the same guy...

674
01:00:32,658 --> 01:00:35,958
那就會是連環謀殺案，最終由你來負責
...so it's a series and ending up in your court.

675
01:00:36,098 --> 01:00:37,998
治安官有頭緒嗎？
Sheriff's getting anywhere?

676
01:00:38,058 --> 01:00:38,998
還沒有
Not yet.

677
01:00:40,568 --> 01:00:42,338
放開我！
Get off of me!

678
01:00:45,068 --> 01:00:46,238
天啊！
Oh, my God!

679
01:00:50,338 --> 01:00:51,158
她在哪兒？
Where is she?

680
01:00:51,198 --> 01:00:53,448
冷靜！冷靜！
Easy, easy, easy.

681
01:00:56,718 --> 01:00:58,188
求你，別這樣
Please, come on.

682
01:00:58,768 --> 01:01:02,958
沒事的  沒事的
It's okay. It's okay.

683
01:01:03,138 --> 01:01:07,058
我的孩子呢？她在哪？
Where is my baby? Where is she?

684
01:01:07,888 --> 01:01:10,098
我要知道出了什麼事
I need to know what happened.

685
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,408
我猜確實是驚天動地了
I guess the earth shattered.

686
01:01:55,208 --> 01:01:58,018
你為何不讓博斯克送你回家？
So why didn't you let Bosko take you home?

687
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:02,218
我也不想掃他們的興
I didn't want to ruin their night too.

688
01:02:02,648 --> 01:02:03,988
是什麼事？
What was it?

689
01:02:06,048 --> 01:02:07,548
你不想知道的
You don't want to know.

690
01:02:07,648 --> 01:02:10,138
我想知道你鐵青的臉孔後面藏著什麼
I'd like to know what's behind that grim look on your face.

691
01:02:10,138 --> 01:02:13,408
我不會這麼做  你知道的  我們走吧
I don't do that. You know it. Let's go.

692
01:02:13,498 --> 01:02:16,748
你從沒告訴我，我會被拒諸事外
You never told me I'd be excluded.

693
01:02:18,658 --> 01:02:21,108
剛才在一起時我告訴過你，寶貝
I told you when we hooked up, baby.

694
01:02:21,148 --> 01:02:23,008
你不得不和我分享…
that you were gonna have to share me...

695
01:02:23,068 --> 01:02:26,848
這星球上所有的壞人和醜行
...with all the bad people and all the ugly events on this planet.

696
01:02:27,008 --> 01:02:29,258
而我願意那種分享…
And I bought into that sharing...

697
01:02:29,498 --> 01:02:31,078
因為我愛你
...because I love you.

698
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:34,088
我愛你發胖、禿頭、有錢、沒錢
I love you fat, bald, money, no money,

699
01:02:34,288 --> 01:02:35,348
開巴士
driving a bus.

700
01:02:35,478 --> 01:02:36,668
我不在乎
I don't care.

701
01:02:37,748 --> 01:02:39,358
但你一定要出現
But you have got to be present

702
01:02:39,358 --> 01:02:40,778
像個普通人那樣，某些時候
like a normal guy, some other time.

703
01:02:40,788 --> 01:02:43,978
那是分享  這不是分享，這是最後才想起
That's shareing. This is not shareing. This is leftover

704
01:02:44,158 --> 01:02:46,988
我懂了  我應該這麼做  回到家說：
I see. What I should do is come home and say:

705
01:02:47,258 --> 01:02:50,968
「嗨，親愛的，你知道嗎？我今天走進一所房子…
"Hi, honey, guess what? I walked into this house today...

706
01:02:50,978 --> 01:02:54,928
「有個吸毒的混蛋剛用微波爐炸了他的嬰孩…
"where this junkie asshole just fried his baby in a microwave...

707
01:02:55,028 --> 01:02:58,498
因他哭的太吵鬧，我和你分享吧
"because he was crying too loud, so let me share that with you.

708
01:02:58,568 --> 01:03:01,408
來，讓我們分享此事  而在分享時…
Come on, let's share that and in sharing it...

709
01:03:01,608 --> 01:03:06,708
我們莫名其妙就可以淨化和驅散所有那些狗屎邪惡  」
"we'll somehow cathartically dispel all that heinous shit."

710
01:03:06,978 --> 01:03:07,818
對嗎？
Right?

711
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:11,258
錯
Wrong.

712
01:03:11,578 --> 01:03:12,788
你知道為什麼？
You know why?

713
01:03:12,908 --> 01:03:14,998
因為你更喜歡日常公事
'Cause you prefer the normal routine.

714
01:03:15,088 --> 01:03:17,468
我們做完愛，你就失去說話的力氣
We fuck and you lose the power of speech.

715
01:03:17,518 --> 01:03:19,688
因為我得控制住我的焦慮
'Cause I got to hold onto my angst.

716
01:03:20,288 --> 01:03:21,838
保存起來
I preserve it.

717
01:03:21,968 --> 01:03:25,268
因為我需要它  它讓我保持敏銳，如履薄冰
because I need it. It keeps me sharp, on the edge.

718
01:03:25,728 --> 01:03:27,068
我必須那樣
Where I gotta be.

719
01:03:34,408 --> 01:03:36,148
你沒有和我一起生活
You don't live with me.

720
01:03:38,708 --> 01:03:41,378
而是活在死人的殘骸中
You live among the remains of dead people.

721
01:03:45,318 --> 01:03:47,518
你查看地形
You read the terrain.

722
01:03:48,288 --> 01:03:50,738
你找尋逝去的跡象…
You search for signs of passing...

723
01:03:51,388 --> 01:03:53,458
找獵物的氣味
for the scent of your prey.

724
01:03:53,528 --> 01:03:55,508
然後追捕他們
and then you hunt them down.

725
01:03:57,128 --> 01:03:59,838
這是你唯一投入的事
That's the only thing you're committed to.

726
01:04:03,268 --> 01:04:06,148
剩餘的是你走過後留下的爛攤子
The rest is the mess you leave as you pass through.

727
01:04:11,408 --> 01:04:14,858
我不明白的是，為何擺脫不了你
What I don't understand is why I can't cut loose of you.

728
01:04:30,598 --> 01:04:32,798
嘿，莉莉
Hey, Lily

729
01:04:34,598 --> 01:04:36,098
走吧，寶貝
Let's go, baby.

730
01:04:38,938 --> 01:04:40,608
我見過那經理了
I met the manager.

731
01:04:41,008 --> 01:04:42,488
那是老闆嗎？
Is that the boss?

732
01:04:43,568 --> 01:04:45,908
讓我坐牢的罪惡，那個混蛋每天都在重複
I did time for what that motherfucker does every day.

733
01:04:46,478 --> 01:04:50,448
你能不能忍著，直到我們給你找到新工作嗎？
Can you just handle it till we find you something new?

734
01:04:51,448 --> 01:04:53,058
你能做到嗎？
Can you do that?

735
01:04:55,118 --> 01:04:58,098
沒有我忍受不了的艱難時刻
Ain't a hard time been invented that I cannot handle.

736
01:05:04,098 --> 01:05:06,408
你為何和我一起，莉莉安？
What you're hanging with me for, Lillian?

737
01:05:07,898 --> 01:05:09,808
因為我為你驕傲
Because I'm proud of you.

738
01:05:15,708 --> 01:05:17,188
為我驕傲？
You're proud of me?

739
01:05:22,148 --> 01:05:24,248
為了什麼？
Why the hell are you proud of me?

740
01:05:25,818 --> 01:05:27,228
回家吧
Come on home.

741
01:05:38,068 --> 01:05:39,808
你在那裏做什麼？
What were you doing there?

742
01:05:39,998 --> 01:05:41,478
我滑雪
I was skiing.

743
01:05:41,668 --> 01:05:43,438
我試著滑雪
I was trying to ski.

744
01:05:44,238 --> 01:05:46,438
人們去那裏就是做這個  你去滑雪…
That's what people do there. You go skiing...

745
01:05:46,478 --> 01:05:49,848
...你與人相識
...and you meet people.

746
01:05:50,178 --> 01:05:51,778
試著開心
You try to have a good time.

747
01:05:51,848 --> 01:05:53,518
- 你開心嗎？
- 沒
- Did you have a good time? - No.

748
01:05:53,578 --> 01:05:54,748
為什麼？
Why not?

749
01:05:55,078 --> 01:05:57,058
我不擅長與人結交
I'm not good at meeting people.

750
01:05:57,518 --> 01:05:58,898
可你認識了我
You met me.

751
01:05:59,658 --> 01:06:02,128
我沒想過會發生
That happened without my thinking about it.

752
01:06:02,588 --> 01:06:04,538
可能是我…
Which is why I probably...

753
01:06:05,158 --> 01:06:07,228
不，你很好
No, it's because you are fine.

754
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:14,538
伊迪，和我一起離開一陣子
Take off with me for a while.

755
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:16,878
去哪？
Where?

756
01:06:17,468 --> 01:06:18,878
新西蘭
New Zealand.

757
01:06:20,178 --> 01:06:21,278
何時？
When?

758
01:06:22,948 --> 01:06:25,548
我得單獨走，你可以在那裏跟我會合
I have to go separate. You can meet me there.

759
01:06:26,048 --> 01:06:27,528
但我的工作...
But my job...

760
01:06:27,618 --> 01:06:29,788
我有錢，你不需要
I got money. You don't need money.

761
01:06:29,888 --> 01:06:32,358
你可以去那邊開間工作室
You could set up a studio and work there.

762
01:06:32,788 --> 01:06:33,988
我不知道
I don't know.

763
01:06:34,058 --> 01:06:35,588
還要知道什麼？
What's there to know?

764
01:06:35,728 --> 01:06:37,198
你結婚了嗎？
Are you married?

765
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:39,898
什麼？
What?

766
01:06:40,058 --> 01:06:42,128
我就差結婚這件事了
The last thing I am is married.

767
01:06:42,298 --> 01:06:45,398
我是一根從即將從零開始走的指針，一片空白
I'm a needle starting at zero going the other way, and double blank

768
01:06:45,408 --> 01:06:47,108
突然間…
All of a sudden...

769
01:06:47,998 --> 01:06:50,068
你這樣的人出現了
someone like you comes along.

770
01:06:53,738 --> 01:06:54,778
你不瞭解我，尼爾
You don't know me, Niel

771
01:06:54,788 --> 01:06:56,248
我足夠瞭解
I know enough.

772
01:07:00,248 --> 01:07:01,658
跟我走
Come with me.

773
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:12,998
怎麼了，寶貝？
What's wrong, babe?

774
01:07:14,758 --> 01:07:17,608
沒問題  都會好起來的  你會去嗎？
Nothing's wrong. Everything's right. Will you go?

775
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:23,608
是的
Yeah.

776
01:07:27,338 --> 01:07:28,318
好
Good.

777
01:07:53,298 --> 01:07:54,708
親愛的
Hi, sweetie.

778
01:07:56,068 --> 01:07:58,548
你忘記媽媽會去接你嗎？
You forget your mom was picking you up?

779
01:08:00,238 --> 01:08:01,238
不是
No.

780
01:08:03,378 --> 01:08:05,148
那是怎麼回事？
So, what's going on?

781
01:08:06,978 --> 01:08:08,718
我想一人靜靜
I felt like being alone.

782
01:08:10,918 --> 01:08:13,558
來吧，我送你回家
Come on, I'll drive you home.

783
01:08:13,558 --> 01:08:15,558
- 嘿，麥克
- 嘿，蘿倫
- Hey, Mike. - Hey, Lauren.

784
01:09:10,308 --> 01:09:11,518
有何動靜？
What's happening?

785
01:09:12,778 --> 01:09:14,418
長官
Sir.

786
01:09:14,478 --> 01:09:17,158
傑克森隊長想知道情況
Captain Jackson wants to know what's going on.

787
01:09:17,688 --> 01:09:20,128
還沒動靜，不要用無線電
Nothing's going on. Stay off the air.

788
01:10:14,438 --> 01:10:15,718
技術
Technique.

789
01:10:19,638 --> 01:10:21,618
（IGM 投資高等級金屬）

790
01:10:35,228 --> 01:10:37,228
芝麻開門  就在那
Open Sesame. Right there.

791
01:11:35,018 --> 01:11:36,428
就是他
There he is.

792
01:12:39,158 --> 01:12:39,888
我們走！
We walk!

793
01:12:39,958 --> 01:12:40,798
我快完事了
I'm there.

794
01:12:40,858 --> 01:12:41,828
我們走！
We walk!

795
01:12:57,168 --> 01:12:58,508
他聽到了
He's heard it.

796
01:13:06,918 --> 01:13:09,808
注意
Heads up.

797
01:13:09,848 --> 01:13:11,988
- 出來一個
- 等一等，隊長
- One's coming out. - Hold it, Captain.

798
01:13:12,048 --> 01:13:14,328
文森特，他沒帶著任何東西
Vincent, he's not carrying anything.

799
01:13:14,618 --> 01:13:15,598
我看見了
I see.

800
01:13:18,828 --> 01:13:19,488
我們上
Here we go.

801
01:13:19,528 --> 01:13:23,998
等我老大命令，他們兩都沒拿什麼東西
Not till my boss says so. Both of them are not carrying anything.

802
01:13:32,678 --> 01:13:33,868
讓他們走
Let them go.

803
01:13:33,908 --> 01:13:35,098
你什麼意思？我們可拘捕他們
What do you mean? We can take them on!

804
01:13:35,138 --> 01:13:36,878
以什麼罪名？你打算起訴他們什麼罪名？
On what? What are you going to take them on?

805
01:13:37,048 --> 01:13:39,178
破壞入口？ 他們還沒偷什麼
Breaking an entry?They didn't steal anything.

806
01:13:39,188 --> 01:13:39,938
還不明白嗎？
Don't you get it?

807
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:43,948
只會被定為雞屎大的輕罪，他們待個6個月就出來了
It gets knocked back to some chickenshit misdemeanor, they do six months and they're out.

808
01:13:43,988 --> 01:13:44,968
決不能這樣結果
No fucking way.

809
01:13:45,188 --> 01:13:47,288
我不願被我老闆罵，就因為你放走他們
I'm not taking the heat from my boss.

810
01:13:47,298 --> 01:13:48,518
他們不能走
They are not walking.

811
01:13:48,518 --> 01:13:52,128
他們就得走  他們會離開  這是我的行動
That's exactly what they'll do. They'll walk. This is my operation.

812
01:13:52,188 --> 01:13:54,998
我有戰術指揮權 ，凌駕於你的級別
I have tactical command that supersedes your rank.

813
01:13:55,058 --> 01:13:58,238
他們會離去，你要讓他們走  操！
They will walk away and you will let them. Fuck!

814
01:14:44,108 --> 01:14:45,588
回去工作
Back to work.

815
01:14:47,518 --> 01:14:51,158
洛杉磯警局？老天，從他媽哪裏冒出來的？
LAPD,  Gee, what? Where the fuck did this heat come from?

816
01:14:51,748 --> 01:14:54,728
也許是他們的一次行動  針對那個區域，不是我們
Maybe it's the score they were onto. The place, not us.

817
01:14:54,818 --> 01:14:56,938
因為那裏被劫過幾次
Because it's been hit a couple of times, you know something.

818
01:14:56,988 --> 01:14:59,658
假設他們盯上我們的電話，我們的房子
Assume they got our phones, our houses.

819
01:14:59,668 --> 01:15:01,668
假設他們盯著我們，此時此刻
Assume they got us right here, right now...

820
01:15:01,728 --> 01:15:04,208
我們身處的每一件事，假設一切
as we sit. Everything. Assume it all.

821
01:15:04,698 --> 01:15:06,798
從凱爾索買的銀行信息，我們怎麼付錢？
How are we gonna buy the bank package from Kelso?

822
01:15:06,868 --> 01:15:08,398
我先墊付，那不是問題
I'll front that. that's not a problem

823
01:15:08,498 --> 01:15:10,238
范·桑特的75萬呢？
What if Van Zant has 750?

824
01:15:10,438 --> 01:15:11,408
范·桑特？聽著
Van Zant? Listen,

825
01:15:11,418 --> 01:15:14,318
我們都火燒眉毛了，你還想和范·桑特來場世界大戰？
with the heat we got, you want to play World War II on the streets with Van Zant?

826
01:15:14,378 --> 01:15:16,548
不，我想問他要我的75萬
No, I want my 750.

827
01:15:16,608 --> 01:15:20,888
我比你們任何人更想搞范·桑特，他是個大雞巴富翁
I got more motivation to whack Van Zant than either of you. He is a fucking luxury.

828
01:15:20,948 --> 01:15:23,618
我們的問題 是劫銀行還是現在就跑路
Our problem is to take the bank, or split right now.

829
01:15:23,718 --> 01:15:26,218
不回家，不收拾東西，什麼也不要
Do not go home, do not pack, nothing.

830
01:15:26,288 --> 01:15:30,758
現在起30秒後 我們各走各路  就這樣
Thirty seconds flat from now, we are gone on our separate ways. That's it.

831
01:15:30,888 --> 01:15:31,958
克裏斯
Chris

832
01:15:35,858 --> 01:15:37,838
銀行值得冒險
The bank is worth the risk.

833
01:15:38,098 --> 01:15:39,578
我需要它，兄弟
I need it, brother.

834
01:15:41,238 --> 01:15:44,438
我們應該留下來拿下它  我出來就是為這個
We should stay and take it down. That's where I come out.

835
01:15:55,448 --> 01:15:57,548
我跟你，尼爾  無論如何
I roll with you, Neil. Whatever.

836
01:15:58,088 --> 01:15:59,848
- 無論如何
- 不行，這次不行，邁克爾
- Whatever. - No, not on this one, Michael.

837
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:01,868
這次，你自己做決定
On this one, you're on your own.

838
01:16:14,838 --> 01:16:17,248
你認為這是最好的做法嗎？
You figure this is the best thing to do?

839
01:16:17,408 --> 01:16:19,468
是最好的做法嗎？
This is the best thing to do?

840
01:16:19,508 --> 01:16:23,568
我已計劃好，完事我就走，這回報是值得的
I've got plans, I'm going away after, so the reward is worth the stretch.

841
01:16:23,608 --> 01:16:26,678
但伊萊恩很照顧你，你有許多積蓄
But Elaine takes good care of you. You got plenty put away.

842
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:28,948
你有國庫券，房產
You got T-bonds, real estate.

843
01:16:29,048 --> 01:16:31,888
如果我是你，我就聰明點，不碰這事
If I were you, I would be smart and cut loose of this.

844
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:51,408
對我來說…
For me...

845
01:16:51,608 --> 01:16:53,708
行動就是美酒
the action is the juice.

846
01:16:54,338 --> 01:16:55,318
我參加
I'm in.

去他們的，我們干

851
01:17:06,718 --> 01:17:09,028
我們走  我們有許多事要做
Let's go. We got a lot of work to do.

852
01:17:22,338 --> 01:17:23,678

- Well, I will... - You can't go in there.

853
01:17:23,678 --> 01:17:25,678

- 你是亞倫·馬西亞諾嗎？
- Can I help you? - Are you Alan Marciano?

856
01:17:31,078 --> 01:17:32,418
對，你他媽是誰？
Who the fuck are you?

857
01:17:32,478 --> 01:17:33,648
我是誰？

LA? This is Las Vegas. You don't even have jurisdiction here.

860
01:17:41,558 --> 01:17:45,128
你知不知道你他媽在推誰？我可認識人
Do you know who the fuck you're pushing around? But I know people here.

誰需要？你的屁股在回新澤西的飛機上，笨蛋
Who needs to? Your ass is on a plane back to New Jersey, jackoff.

890
01:19:04,468 --> 01:19:05,448
對
Right.

891
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:08,238
這裏的安保系統就是個笑話
The security systems around here are a joke.

892

903
01:19:57,158 --> 01:19:58,698
對他們來說得益太少了

909
01:20:18,578 --> 01:20:20,718
煉油廠和廢料場？
A refinery and a scrap yard.

910
01:20:22,148 --> 01:20:23,788
是什麼鬼玩意兒？

911
01:20:23,848 --> 01:20:25,958
那正是我們正想弄清楚的
That's what we are trying to figure out.

我有個想法…

01:20:42,868 --> 01:20:44,818
他們在看些什麼
what they're looking at.

916
01:20:48,478 --> 01:20:50,748
想知道他們在看什麼嗎？
Want to know what they're looking at?

917
01:20:52,548 --> 01:20:55,458
我是指，這傢伙可真厲害，真夠職業的哈
I mean, is this guy something, or is he something?

918
01:20:56,948 --> 01:20:58,618
這夥人很棒
This crew is good.

919
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:02,658
你們想知道他們看什麼嗎？

920
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:04,788

946
01:22:58,368 --> 01:23:01,858
認為你算某種明星  做這個厲害，那個厲害的
thinks you're some kind of star. You do this sharp, that sharp.

947
01:23:01,888 --> 01:23:04,358
「看看這人多厲害，能想到這個」
"Look how sharp this guy is to figure that."

948
01:23:06,778 --> 01:23:08,318
跟犯病般滑稽
Funny as a heart attack.

949
01:23:08,378 --> 01:23:12,018
三次婚姻，什麼東西？你覺得這說明他喜歡待在家裏？
Three marriages? What the fuck? Do you think that means he likes staying home?

950
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:15,098
說明他是那種待在外面…
Means he's one of those guys out there...

951
01:23:15,288 --> 01:23:18,028
整晚搜尋的人，敬業獻身
...prowling around all night, dedicated.

952
01:23:20,358 --> 01:23:22,808
有他和這麼多的火力，你應該放棄
With him and this much heat, you should pass.

953
01:23:30,108 --> 01:23:31,738
值得一搏
It's worth the stretch.

954
01:23:32,708 --> 01:23:34,688
這人可以成功或失手
This guy can hit or miss.

955
01:23:35,198 --> 01:23:36,808
你一次也不能失手
You can't miss once.

956
01:23:37,608 --> 01:23:38,778
你肯定嗎？
You sure?

957
01:23:39,918 --> 01:23:41,258
我肯定
I am sure.

958
01:23:47,058 --> 01:23:48,528
我們去車房吧
Let's go to the garage.

959
01:24:02,178 --> 01:24:03,478
嘉斯汀
Justine.

960
01:24:09,178 --> 01:24:09,878
嘉斯汀
Justine.

961
01:24:17,148 --> 01:24:18,628
我們要去哪兒？
Where we going?

962
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:25,238
好吧，你要去哪裏？
Okay, where are you going?

963
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,798
外面
Out.

964
01:25:25,448 --> 01:25:26,518
他們在什麼頻道上？
What are they on?

965
01:25:25,518 --> 01:25:27,788
TAC
Tactical Air Control 戰術空軍控制

966
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:27,858
第九戰術空軍控制頻道
TAC 9.

967
01:25:29,718 --> 01:25:31,848
他們往北走，出機場的405公路上面
They're northbound out LAx on the 405.

968
01:25:31,888 --> 01:25:34,168
我們有四個地面行動小組
We got four ground units.

969
01:25:52,378 --> 01:25:54,408
我是18號機的文森特·漢納
This is Vincent Hanna in Air 18.

970
01:25:54,448 --> 01:25:55,358
你是誰？
Who have I got?

971
01:25:55,478 --> 01:25:57,458
我是JJ，我在40號機上
This is JJ. I'm in Air 40.

972
01:25:57,688 --> 01:25:59,178
理查德·格洛弗和我一起
Richard Glover's with me.

973
01:25:59,318 --> 01:26:00,938
車朝105公路東行駛…
It's on the 105 eastbound...

974
01:26:00,938 --> 01:26:03,258
接近110交換道
approaching the 110 interchange.

975
01:26:04,158 --> 01:26:05,498
你在持續追蹤？
You running a revolving tail?

976
01:26:05,788 --> 01:26:08,398
對  我有兩個小組在前面，三個在後面
Yes. I got two units in front, three behind.

977
01:26:08,658 --> 01:26:11,938
好，叫其中一個在佛蒙特匝道入口來載我
Okay. Have one of them pick me up at the Vermont on-ramp.

978
01:26:12,898 --> 01:26:14,168
我們走
Let's go.

979
01:27:04,248 --> 01:27:07,888
我離他有一百碼遠嗎？太近還是太遠？
Am I 100 yards, or what? Am I close or far, or what?

980
01:27:08,358 --> 01:27:10,428
300碼，中間車道
Three hundred yards, center lane.

981
01:28:17,558 --> 01:28:18,898
你好嗎？
How're you doing?

982
01:28:22,558 --> 01:28:25,238
我能請你喝杯咖啡嗎？
What do you say I buy you a cup of coffee?

983
01:28:31,708 --> 01:28:33,048
好，當然  我們走
Yeah, sure. Let's go.

984
01:28:33,778 --> 01:28:35,048
跟著我
Follow me.

985
01:28:50,828 --> 01:28:52,698
在福爾松待了七年
Seven years in Folsom.

986
01:28:53,428 --> 01:28:55,268
單獨囚禁三年
In the hole for three.

987
01:28:55,398 --> 01:28:56,868
之前在麥克尼爾
McNeil before that.

988
01:29:00,198 --> 01:29:02,178
麥克尼爾有傳說的那樣糟嗎？
McNeil as tough as they say?

989
01:29:03,408 --> 01:29:05,378
你想當監獄管理學者嗎？
You looking to become a penologist?

990
01:29:06,608 --> 01:29:08,278
你想再回去嗎？
You looking to go back?

991
01:29:08,508 --> 01:29:12,578
你知道，我追捕一些團伙  那些傢伙想犯事但被抓回去了
You know, I chased down some crews. Guys just looking to fuck up, get busted back.

992
01:29:12,748 --> 01:29:13,848
是你嗎？
That you?

993
01:29:15,048 --> 01:29:17,358
你一定是抓了些蠢貨團伙
You must've worked some dipshit crews.

994
01:29:18,088 --> 01:29:19,828
各種類型的我都跟
I worked all kinds.

995
01:29:23,218 --> 01:29:27,288
你看見我為尋求刺激搶劫酒鋪，胸前還刺著「天生廢柴」的紋身嗎？
You see me doing thrill-seeking liquor store holdup with a "Born to Lose" tattoo on my chest?

996
01:29:28,358 --> 01:29:29,338
不，我沒看見
No, I do not.

997
01:29:29,928 --> 01:29:30,908
對了
Right.

998
01:29:32,498 --> 01:29:34,338
我絕不會回監獄去
I am never going back.

999
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:38,138
那就別搞什麼行動
Then don't take down scores.

1000
01:29:39,408 --> 01:29:41,078
我做我擅長的事
I do what I do best.

1001
01:29:41,238 --> 01:29:45,188
我做我的，你做你最擅長的事  去阻止我這樣的人
I take scores. You do what you do best. Try to stop guys like me.

1002
01:29:49,048 --> 01:29:51,318
你從沒想過要正常的生活？
You never wanted a regular type life?

1003
01:29:52,088 --> 01:29:54,788
那是他媽什麼東西？燒烤和球賽嗎？
What the fuck is that? The barbecues and the ball games?

1004
01:29:56,858 --> 01:29:57,798
是的
Yeah.

1005
01:30:00,258 --> 01:30:02,328
像你這樣的正常生活？
This regular type like your life?

1006
01:30:03,028 --> 01:30:05,008
我的生活？不，我的生活…
My life? No, my life...

1007
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:08,468
我的生活是一片重災區
My life's a disaster zone.

1008
01:30:10,308 --> 01:30:12,838
我有個一團糟的繼女
I got a stepdaughter so fucked up...

1009
01:30:13,368 --> 01:30:16,478
因為她的生父是個大渾蛋
...because her real father is this large-type asshole.

1010
01:30:16,538 --> 01:30:17,848
我有個妻子
I got a wife.

1011
01:30:17,908 --> 01:30:21,718
我們互不搭理，在下滑的婚姻之路上越來越遠  第三次婚姻了
We're passing each other on the down slope of a marriage.My third.

1012
01:30:23,948 --> 01:30:27,728
因為我花光時間在街頭追捕你這樣的人
Because I spend all my time chasing guys like you around the block.

1013
01:30:27,788 --> 01:30:29,128
那就是我的生活
That's my life.

1014
01:30:35,628 --> 01:30:37,398
有人曾對我說…
Guy told me one time

1015
01:30:39,198 --> 01:30:43,498
「不要和任何事物有關聯，包括那些讓你30秒內都不願離開的
"Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat

1016
01:30:43,508 --> 01:30:46,178
就算你感覺到了來自街角的危險  」
"if you feel the heat around the corner."

1017
01:30:47,438 --> 01:30:50,848
如果你盯著我，我一行動你就得跟著…
Now, if you're on me and you got to move when I move...

1018
01:30:51,208 --> 01:30:53,948
你怎能期望維護好婚姻呢？
how do you expect to keep a marriage?

1019
01:30:56,078 --> 01:30:57,928
這個想法很有趣
That's an interesting point.

1020
01:30:59,448 --> 01:31:00,788
你是什麼人，修道士？
What are you, a monk?

1021
01:31:02,058 --> 01:31:03,328
我有個女人
I have a woman.

1022
01:31:03,858 --> 01:31:05,338
你怎麼跟她說？
What do you tell her?

1023
01:31:07,758 --> 01:31:09,498
我告訴她我是推銷員
I tell her I'm a salesman.

1024
01:31:16,268 --> 01:31:19,338
那麼，如果你發現我從街角走來…
So, if you spot me coming around that corner...

1025
01:31:20,338 --> 01:31:22,248
你就從這女人身邊走開？
you'll just walk out on this woman?

1026
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:25,418
不說句再見？
Not say good-bye?

1027
01:31:26,178 --> 01:31:27,848
那是紀律
That's the discipline.

1028
01:31:28,678 --> 01:31:30,488
聽上去挺虛無縹緲的
That's pretty vacant.

1029
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,318
正是如此
It is what it is.

1030
01:31:32,448 --> 01:31:35,258
就是這樣，否則我倆還是幹點別的吧，夥計
It's that, or we both better go do something else, pal.

1031
01:31:37,228 --> 01:31:39,198
別的職業我不知道該怎樣去做
I don't know how to do anything else.

1032
01:31:39,688 --> 01:31:41,138
我也是
Neither do I.

1033
01:31:43,928 --> 01:31:45,498
也不太想做
I don't much want to either.

1034
01:31:46,268 --> 01:31:47,468
我也不想
Neither do I.

1035
01:31:55,178 --> 01:31:57,778
知道嗎，我不斷做同一個夢
You know, I have this recurring dream.

1036
01:31:59,648 --> 01:32:02,628
我坐在一張很大的宴會餐桌邊…
I'm sitting at this big banquet table and...

1037
01:32:02,678 --> 01:32:06,318
我調查的所有兇案受害人都坐在那裏…
...all the victims of all the murders I ever worked are sitting there...

1038
01:32:06,388 --> 01:32:09,988
他們用漆黑的眼珠子瞪著我
and they're staring at me with these black eyeballs...

1039
01:32:10,958 --> 01:32:14,908
因為汩汩血液從他們頭部傷口流淌出來
because they got eight-ball hemorrhages from the head wounds.

1040
01:32:16,158 --> 01:32:19,228
他們就在那，這些發脹的人…
And there they are, these big balloon people...

1041
01:32:19,928 --> 01:32:23,138
因為我發現他們時，他們已在床下躺了兩周
because I found them two weeks after they'd been under the bed.

1042
01:32:23,908 --> 01:32:26,378
鄰居報稱有惡臭…
The neighbors reported the smell...

1043
01:32:27,138 --> 01:32:29,008
他們就在那裏…
and there they are...

1044
01:32:29,078 --> 01:32:30,818
全部坐在那裏
all just sitting there.

1045
01:32:33,008 --> 01:32:34,218
他們說什麼？
What do they say?

1046
01:32:36,248 --> 01:32:37,228
什麼也沒
Nothing.

1047
01:32:37,688 --> 01:32:38,918
沒說話？
No talk?

1048
01:32:39,518 --> 01:32:42,858
他們無話可說
They have nothing to say.

1049
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:45,738
我們只是彼此望著對方
We just look at each other.

1050
01:32:46,688 --> 01:32:48,368
他們望著我…
They look at me...

1051
01:32:48,858 --> 01:32:51,028
就這樣  就是這個夢
...and that's it. That's the dream.

1052
01:32:53,868 --> 01:32:55,778
我夢見自己遇溺
I have one where I'm drowning.

1053
01:32:56,498 --> 01:33:00,178
我得弄醒自己並呼吸，否則會亡於夢中
I gotta wake myself up and start breathing or I'll die in my sleep.

1054
01:33:02,278 --> 01:33:03,648
你知道那是什麼意思嗎？
You know what's that about?

1055
01:33:04,208 --> 01:33:06,718
還有...足夠的時間
There...having enough time.

1056
01:33:08,378 --> 01:33:09,618
足夠的時間…
Enough time...

1057
01:33:10,018 --> 01:33:11,788
做你想做的事？
...to do what you want to do?

1058
01:33:11,948 --> 01:33:13,228
正確
That's right.

1059
01:33:15,718 --> 01:33:17,128
你現在在做？
You doing it now?

1060
01:33:17,258 --> 01:33:18,528
沒，還沒有
No, not yet.

1061
01:33:24,128 --> 01:33:26,108
你知道，我們坐在這裏…
You know, we're sitting here...

1062
01:33:27,468 --> 01:33:29,708
你和我就像一對正常的夥伴
you and I like a couple of regular fellas.

1063
01:33:29,868 --> 01:33:32,448
你做你的事，我做我得做的
You do what you do, and I do what I gotta do.

1064
01:33:34,738 --> 01:33:37,148
現在我們面對面…
Now that we've been face to face...

1065
01:33:40,078 --> 01:33:42,748
我是個男人的話，就必須撂倒你…
if I'm a man and I gotta put you away...

1066
01:33:43,078 --> 01:33:44,558
我不會喜歡的
I won't like it.

1067
01:33:45,418 --> 01:33:46,748
但我告訴你…
But, I tell you...

1068
01:33:49,158 --> 01:33:51,138
如果是在你…
if it's between you...

1069
01:33:51,328 --> 01:33:55,168
和某個你要把他妻子變成寡婦的可憐蟲之間，選的話…
and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna turn into a widow...

1070
01:33:56,098 --> 01:33:57,338
兄弟…
brother...

1071
01:33:57,768 --> 01:33:59,638
你完蛋了
you are going down.

1072
01:34:12,178 --> 01:34:14,518
這枚硬幣還有反面
There's a flip side to that coin.

1073
01:34:16,778 --> 01:34:19,018
若你把我逼入絕境…
What if you do got me boxed in...

1074
01:34:19,418 --> 01:34:21,228
而我必須撂倒你呢？
and I gotta put you down?

1075
01:34:22,358 --> 01:34:24,098
因為無論如何…
Because no matter what...

1076
01:34:24,628 --> 01:34:26,598
你不能阻攔我
you won't get in my way.

1077
01:34:27,858 --> 01:34:30,098
我們曾經面對面，是的
We've been face to face, yeah.

1078
01:34:33,398 --> 01:34:35,138
但我不會遲疑
But I will not hesitate.

1079
01:34:35,468 --> 01:34:36,878
一秒鐘也不
Not for a second.

1080
01:34:43,278 --> 01:34:44,748
也許會是這樣
Maybe that's will be.

1081
01:34:47,478 --> 01:34:48,548
或者…
Or...

1082
01:34:48,878 --> 01:34:50,218
誰知道呢？
who knows?

1083
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:53,188
也許我們會永遠不再見
Maybe we'll never see each other again.

1084
01:35:08,998 --> 01:35:10,538
他們甩掉了我們
They dumped us.

1085
01:35:11,808 --> 01:35:12,678
什麼？
What?

1086
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:14,778
他們甩掉了我們
They dumped us.

1087
01:35:15,378 --> 01:35:16,648
什麼意思？
What do you mean They dumped us ?

1088
01:35:16,708 --> 01:35:17,878
克裏斯溜走了.
Chris slipped his tail.

1089
01:35:18,008 --> 01:35:20,008
他沒談及他們的行動
He doesn't talk about their scores...

1090
01:35:20,078 --> 01:35:23,488
所以我從馬西亞諾那裏沒問出什麼  我試過了
...so there's nothing for me to get from Marciano. I just tried.

1091
01:35:23,818 --> 01:35:25,818
- 邁克爾·切裏托呢？
- 一樣
- What about Cheritto? - Same.

Transponders got put on a bus to San Clemente.

1093
01:35:31,228 --> 01:35:33,098
他們甩掉了我們所有的監視？
They dumped all our surveillance?

1094
01:35:33,158 --> 01:35:35,398
是的，同一時間，晚上九點.
Yes, at the same time. 9:00 p.m.

1095
01:35:36,628 --> 01:35:40,068
半小時前我還和麥考利一起喝咖啡！
I had coffee with McCauley half an hour ago!

1096
01:35:40,268 --> 01:35:42,738
我們盯著你們，然後麥考利駛向機場
We were on you. Then McCaouley drives to LAX

1097
01:35:42,888 --> 01:35:45,238
監視組不能飛過去，因為航線限制
the surveillance can't fly over, because of the flight path

1098
01:35:45,738 --> 01:35:48,178
他的車還在那裏，人不見了
His car's still there. He's gone.

1099
01:35:53,578 --> 01:35:58,218
還有誰知道這些人他媽的在哪兒？
Does anybody have any idea where the fuck these people are?

1100
01:36:58,048 --> 01:36:59,218
有他的消息嗎？
Hear from him?

1101
01:36:59,908 --> 01:37:02,578
什麼也沒有  沒消息更讓我不安
Not a thing. And not hearing bothers me more.

1102
01:37:02,588 --> 01:37:04,188
這人在哪兒？
Where's this guy?

1103
01:37:06,548 --> 01:37:07,458
這裏有個人…
This guy here...

1104
01:37:07,518 --> 01:37:08,958
我們僱用他
we put him on.

1105
01:37:09,118 --> 01:37:10,788
說他認識麥考利
Says he knows McCauley.

1106
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:17,438
你是誰？

1109
01:37:22,468 --> 01:37:25,678
我日夜守在這間辦公室裏  你有多熟識他？
I've been living in this office day and night. How well do you know him?

1110
01:37:27,038 --> 01:37:29,538
我們一起做過些大行動
We took some major scores together.

1111
01:37:33,478 --> 01:37:35,388
為什麼他一直沒聯繫我？
Why haven't I heard from him?

1112
01:37:35,718 --> 01:37:37,658
現在他可能正忙著
He's probably busy right now.

1113
01:37:37,988 --> 01:37:39,658
但他行事很徹底
But he's real thorough.

1114
01:37:40,988 --> 01:37:43,158
他不會忘記你的
He ain't going to forget about you.

1115
01:37:43,458 --> 01:37:44,868
可真讓人放心

1116
01:37:46,658 --> 01:37:49,158
我有法子可以在這裏用上

1117

可能對你會有大用處

1118

認出那烤肉的人嗎？

1119
01:38:23,698 --> 01:38:24,368
沒
No.

1120
01:38:24,428 --> 01:38:25,268

1122
01:38:29,438 --> 01:38:30,968

拿走！
Pick up!

1128
01:38:44,788 --> 01:38:46,318
他到底在哪兒？
Where the hell is he?

1129
01:38:46,448 --> 01:38:48,428
我想查看一下工作車的位置
I want to check the slot for the work car.

我甩不掉他們

你才看見他們嗎？

1138

不，他們平行跟著我

我可以再試試甩掉他們

He stays with me.

1352
02:04:04,578 --> 02:04:05,988
那麼，現在如何？
So, what now?

1353
02:04:08,778 --> 02:04:09,918
他說的對
Well, he's right.

1354
02:04:09,978 --> 02:04:12,048
因為你想脫身嗎？這就是出路
'cause you want out? This is out.

1355
02:04:13,888 --> 02:04:16,158
你覺得你會背叛克裏斯嗎？
You believe you have to betray Chris?

1356
02:04:16,318 --> 02:04:17,458
沒門
No shit.

1357
02:04:18,028 --> 02:04:20,438
正是如此，你不得不這樣
That's right. You would have to.

1358
02:04:21,028 --> 02:04:25,168
瞧，如果你不出賣克裏斯，就會犧牲掉多米尼克
See, if you don't betray Chris, you victimize Dominick.

1359
02:04:25,798 --> 02:04:29,378
等你作為從犯入獄，他就會成為孤兒
'Cause he becomes an orphan when you go to prison as an accessory...

1360
02:04:29,378 --> 02:04:34,408
你沒有父母照顧他，所以他會被送到寄養家庭
'cause you got no parents to take him. So he ends up raised in foster homes.

1361
02:04:34,408 --> 02:04:36,188
青少年中心
juvenile facilities.

1362
02:04:36,408 --> 02:04:38,178
之後他會偷車
Then he steals a car.

1363
02:04:38,878 --> 02:04:43,358
然後他會加入「格鬥學院」，就像那些街頭混混
Then he winds up in gladiator academies like Chino and Tracy.

1364
02:04:44,388 --> 02:04:46,188
毀了自己一生
Fucked for life.

1365
02:04:47,858 --> 02:04:50,598
你知道會發生什麼，因為你是過來人
You know what happens, because you've been there.

1366
02:04:52,158 --> 02:04:56,428
多米尼克還沒機會選擇他的生活，但克裏斯選了
Dominick didn't get a chance yet to choose his life. But Chris did.

1367
02:04:58,468 --> 02:05:01,208
如果交出克裏斯，你就毫無干係
If you give up Chris, you get off clean.

1368
02:05:02,168 --> 02:05:03,578
你可以做到的…
You can do it...

1369
02:05:03,898 --> 02:05:06,178
為你的孩子，這樣你能撫養他長大
for your kid, so you can raise him.

1370
02:05:10,178 --> 02:05:11,588
你還有什麼要說服我的？
What else are you selling?

1371
02:05:11,648 --> 02:05:13,048
各種狗屎爛事
All kinds of shit.

1372
02:05:14,518 --> 02:05:16,818
但我用不著說，你知道的
But I don't have to sell this, you know it.

1373
02:05:16,828 --> 02:05:19,358
這種爛事用不著我來告訴你
This kind of shit here sells itself.

1374
02:05:26,088 --> 02:05:27,428
好了，丹尼，最新消息
Okay, Danni, here's an update.

1375
02:05:27,558 --> 02:05:29,328
杜拉克在二號線上
Drucker's on Line 2.

1376
02:05:29,498 --> 02:05:30,698
警督，等一等
Lieutenant, hold on for a second.

1377
02:05:33,698 --> 02:05:35,768
警督，杜拉克警官在另一線上
Lieutenant, I have sergeant Drucker's on the other line.

1378
02:05:36,058 --> 02:05:37,508
會議通話吧
Conference him in.

1379
02:05:38,838 --> 02:05:39,748
說吧
Go ahead.

1380
02:05:40,268 --> 02:05:41,908
文森特，是我
Vincent, it's me.

1381
02:05:44,578 --> 02:05:46,748
一個回答  你決定好了？
One answer. What's it going to be?

1382
02:05:53,818 --> 02:05:56,288
我們準備好了，她會打電話
We're set here. She'll make the call.

1383
02:05:56,358 --> 02:05:59,038
好，很好  情況是這樣
Okay, That's good. Here's the deal here.

1384
02:05:59,858 --> 02:06:02,958
休·本尼已改過自新…
Hugh Benny has reformed his wayward life...

1385
02:06:03,128 --> 02:06:05,628
成為重生的好市民
...and become a born-again good citizen.

1386
02:06:05,898 --> 02:06:09,998
看起來，尼爾被一個叫溫格洛的牛仔出賣給我們
Apparently, Neil got sold out to us by this cowboy named Waingro.

1387
02:06:10,538 --> 02:06:13,408
溫格洛曾是尼爾團伙的一員
Waingro used to be a part of Neil's crew

1388
02:06:13,558 --> 02:06:16,748
後來替一個洗錢人工作，名叫范·桑特
then went to work for a money launderer named Van Zant.

1389
02:06:17,098 --> 02:06:20,658
我們說話時 有小組在范·桑特家中…
Units are at Van Zant's house as we speak...

1390
02:06:20,678 --> 02:06:22,538
因為他今晚較早前被射殺
...because he got shot dead earlier tonight.

1391
02:06:22,548 --> 02:06:26,558
現在，如果尼爾要追殺別的人，那就溫格洛
If Neil goes after anybody else, it's going to be Waingro.

1392
02:06:26,748 --> 02:06:30,518
溫格洛剛拿到侯爵機場酒店的一間套房…
Waingro just got himself a suite at the Airport Marquis...

1393
02:06:30,528 --> 02:06:32,338
化名傑米森
under the name Jamieson.

1394
02:06:32,558 --> 02:06:37,028
他現在在那裏  我要你把這消息告訴縣裏的保釋擔保人、賭場經紀人、
He's there now. I want you to get that to bail bondsmen, bookies,

1395
02:06:37,038 --> 02:06:40,028
外派警員以及線人
...assignment officers and snitches in County.

1396
02:06:40,498 --> 02:06:42,898
任何你想得到 會把消息傳出去的人
Anyone you can think of who'll put it on the street.

1397
02:06:42,908 --> 02:06:44,498
派一組人到酒店
Deploy a team at the hotel...

1398
02:06:44,568 --> 02:06:47,238
並每30分鐘親自檢查通訊
and personally check their coms every 30 minutes.

1399
02:06:47,308 --> 02:06:49,618
因為也許尼爾會去找他
Because maybe Neil will go for him.

1400
02:06:49,848 --> 02:06:51,588
好嗎？你感覺如何？
Okay? How're you feeling?

1401
02:06:52,078 --> 02:06:53,748
吊著膀子，但我會活下來
Hang up, but I'll live.

1402
02:06:53,758 --> 02:06:54,848
好
Okay

1403
02:07:02,818 --> 02:07:04,058
他在這裏
He's here.

1404
02:07:04,928 --> 02:07:06,598
尼爾還在這裏
Neil is still here.

1405
02:07:07,808 --> 02:07:09,258
我能感覺到
I can feel it.

1406
02:07:10,098 --> 02:07:11,568
會留多久？
For how long?

1407
02:07:13,068 --> 02:07:15,048
七八個小時，最多
Seven, eight hours, max.

1408
02:07:24,408 --> 02:07:25,748
你幹了什麼？
What did you do?

1409
02:07:26,248 --> 02:07:27,118
那是你幹的？
That was you?

1410
02:07:27,678 --> 02:07:29,418
那是我的工作  我不是賣金屬的
That's what I do. I don't sell metal.

1411
02:07:30,278 --> 02:07:33,288
本來沒事的，之後你飛過去  現在麻煩了
Would have been okay, you fly out after. Now it's jammed.

1412
02:07:33,448 --> 02:07:34,668
我們要一起走
We gotta go together.

1413
02:07:34,838 --> 02:07:37,588
那些人是和你一起的？
Those other people were with you?

1414
02:07:39,388 --> 02:07:40,998
我的朋友，邁克爾…
My friend, Michael...

1415
02:07:42,698 --> 02:07:44,328
他知道風險，他本不必去的
...he knew the risks, he wouldn't have to be there.

1416
02:07:49,168 --> 02:07:51,238
常在河邊走哪能不濕鞋
When it rains, you get wet.

1417
02:07:54,088 --> 02:07:55,278
收拾東西  我們走
Get packed. Let's go.

1418
02:08:02,588 --> 02:08:03,478
伊迪
Eady.

1419
02:08:04,588 --> 02:08:05,338
伊迪
Eady.

1420
02:08:14,658 --> 02:08:16,368
你為何這樣對我？
Why did you do this to me?

1421
02:08:28,238 --> 02:08:29,548
不會有事的.
It's gonnabe all right.

1422
02:08:29,708 --> 02:08:31,608
明白嗎，不會有事的
You understand? It'll be all right

1423
02:08:36,078 --> 02:08:38,388
不會有事的
It's going to be all right.

1424
02:08:49,828 --> 02:08:52,998
這地址D層18單位有一輛科邁羅
There's a Camaro at this address, Level D, Slot 18.

1425
02:08:58,238 --> 02:08:59,718
這兒有些現金
Here's some cash.

1426
02:09:02,708 --> 02:09:04,018
什麼時候結束？
When is it over?

1427
02:09:07,408 --> 02:09:09,118
現在起22小時.
Twenty-two hours from now.

1428
02:09:09,448 --> 02:09:13,208
- 然後我們安全離開這裏
- 你何時讓我走？
- Then we get out of here clean. - When will you let me leave?

1429
02:09:17,058 --> 02:09:18,128
現在就可以
Go now.

1430
02:09:18,188 --> 02:09:20,188
你想出去？門在那邊
You want out? There's the door.

1431
02:09:20,758 --> 02:09:22,758
你稍後會讓我離去嗎？
Will you let me leave later?

1432
02:09:27,898 --> 02:09:29,468
不會再這樣了
It will be different.

1433
02:09:31,108 --> 02:09:32,878
你還不明白嗎？
Do you even understand?

1434
02:10:03,798 --> 02:10:05,178
準備好了
It's ready.

1435
02:10:05,278 --> 02:10:07,218
文森特
Vincent.

1436
02:10:12,878 --> 02:10:14,718
這是我的朋友拉爾夫
This is my friend Ralph.

1437
02:10:15,318 --> 02:10:17,318
你沒說你已經…
You didn't tell me you were...

1438
02:10:18,148 --> 02:10:19,528
天啊！
Oh, my God!

1439
02:10:19,688 --> 02:10:20,958
蘿倫呢？
Where's Lauren?

1440
02:10:21,288 --> 02:10:23,008
她在麗薩貝絲家
She's at Lisa-Beth's.

1441
02:10:23,048 --> 02:10:25,848
此事和我無關，我很抱歉
This has nothing to do with me. I'm sorry.

1442
02:10:25,988 --> 02:10:26,928
你有什麼要抱歉？
What are you sorry about?

1443
02:10:26,988 --> 02:10:28,158
坐下
Sit down.

1444
02:10:28,798 --> 02:10:30,208
你都不生氣嗎？
Don't you even get angry?

1445
02:10:31,398 --> 02:10:32,498
我生氣
I'm angry.

1446
02:10:34,228 --> 02:10:36,108
我很生氣，拉爾夫
I'm very angry, Ralph.

1447
02:10:36,668 --> 02:10:39,478
你可以干我太太，只要她想讓你干
You can ball my wife if she wants you to.

1448
02:10:41,308 --> 02:10:44,008
你可以在她的沙發上晃悠
You can lounge around here on her sofa.

1449
02:10:45,808 --> 02:10:47,688
在她前夫的…
In her ex-husband's...

1450
02:10:48,178 --> 02:10:51,248
死板科技後現代主義的鬼房子中
dead-tech, post-modernistic, bullshit house.

1451
02:10:51,318 --> 02:10:52,728
你想的話
if you want to.

1452
02:10:55,088 --> 02:10:57,328
但你不能看…
But you do not get to watch...

1453
02:10:58,028 --> 02:10:59,588
我他媽的
...my fucking...

1454
02:10:59,588 --> 02:11:01,368
電視機！
...television set!

1455
02:11:01,428 --> 02:11:02,798
看在上帝的份上
For God's sake.

1456
02:11:09,638 --> 02:11:11,478
把電視機放下
Put the television set down.

1457
02:11:11,568 --> 02:11:12,528
我從對你不忠，婊子
I never cheated on you, bitch.

1458
02:11:12,568 --> 02:11:13,908
也許你應該
Maybe you should have.

1459
02:11:14,268 --> 02:11:15,728
- 我應該嗎？
- 你與此有關
- I should have? - You're a party to this.

1460
02:11:15,768 --> 02:11:19,748
我要拉爾夫干你，因為這使我開心
I made Ralph fuck you because it makes me feel good.

1461
02:11:19,808 --> 02:11:21,478
我們的處境荒謬
Our situation is absurd.

1462
02:11:24,048 --> 02:11:26,088
住口，拉爾夫！坐下！
Shut up, Ralph! Sit down!

1463
02:11:29,758 --> 02:11:33,668
為什麼我要理清事情，還要向你解釋？
Why is it that I have to figure things out and explain them to you?

1464
02:11:33,828 --> 02:11:36,168
我心口如一，而且言出必行
I say what I mean, and I do what I say.

1465
02:11:36,698 --> 02:11:37,798
多麼可敬
How admirable.

1466
02:11:37,868 --> 02:11:40,168
- 一點沒錯
- 可沒有任何事是關於我們的
- You bet. - Except none of it's about us.

1467
02:11:40,798 --> 02:11:41,778
是的
No.

1468
02:11:43,238 --> 02:11:46,078
我可能是抽大麻被定住了或興奮劑迷糊了，但
I may be stoned on grass and Prozac but

1469
02:11:46,738 --> 02:11:49,178
你像個死人走出我們的生活
you've been walking through our life dead.

1470
02:11:49,878 --> 02:11:53,978
現在我還要找拉爾夫來貶低自己，來終斷和你的關係
And now I have to demean myself with Ralph just to get closure with you.

1471
02:12:06,988 --> 02:12:09,398
護照、旅行支票、信用卡
Passports, traveler's checks, plastic.

1472
02:12:09,898 --> 02:12:11,168
這飛機…
The plane...

1473
02:12:11,568 --> 02:12:14,598
在洛杉磯機場包機站17號機庫
charter terminal, LAx, Hangar 17.

1474
02:12:14,868 --> 02:12:16,778
呼號是「1011山嶺」
Call letters are 1011 Sierra.

1475
02:12:20,038 --> 02:12:21,238
降落…
Touches down...

1476
02:12:21,308 --> 02:12:23,878
等你五分鐘然後便起飛
holds for you five minutes, then splits.

1477
02:12:24,108 --> 02:12:27,648
飛機經得起航空局的檢查  飛行計劃什麼的
The plane will stand an FAA check. Filed a flight plan, the works.

1478
02:12:29,278 --> 02:12:30,288
克裏斯在哪？
Where's Chris?

1479
02:12:30,948 --> 02:12:31,918
他走了
He's gone.

1480
02:12:33,318 --> 02:12:34,298
什麼？
What?

1481
02:12:35,118 --> 02:12:37,428
他說要自己走  去找莎琳了
Said he's going on his own. Went to find Charlene.

1482
02:12:37,588 --> 02:12:39,798
- 是你帶他來這兒？
- 對，我帶他來了
- Did you bring him here? - Yeah, I brought him here.

1483
02:12:40,808 --> 02:12:41,828
怎麼回事？
What happened?

1484
02:12:42,928 --> 02:12:44,498
這是個自由國家，兄弟
It's a free country, man.

1485
02:12:49,738 --> 02:12:51,578
九點聯絡我…
Check in with me at 9:00...

1486
02:12:51,938 --> 02:12:53,748
一切無恙
everything is still cool.

1487
02:12:55,438 --> 02:12:56,608
好的
All right.

1488
02:13:19,968 --> 02:13:22,308
我甚至不知道自己在做什麼
I don't know even what I'm doing anymore.

1489
02:13:25,568 --> 02:13:27,378
我知道生命短促
I know life is short.

1490
02:13:28,008 --> 02:13:30,108
無論多久都是運氣
Whatever time you get is luck.

1491
02:13:32,808 --> 02:13:34,378
你想走？
You want to walk?

1492
02:13:37,218 --> 02:13:39,018
你現在就可以走…
You walk right now...

1493
02:13:40,618 --> 02:13:42,218
你想的話
all on your own.

1494
02:13:42,888 --> 02:13:45,558
你願意選擇跟我來
On your own you choose to come with me.

1495
02:13:51,968 --> 02:13:53,568
我只知道…
All I know is...

1496
02:13:55,838 --> 02:13:59,108
我到任何地方去都毫無意義
there's no point in me going anywhere anymore

1497
02:14:00,668 --> 02:14:02,678
如果我會獨自一人
if it's going to be alone.

1498
02:14:03,708 --> 02:14:05,238
沒有你
without you.

1499
02:15:04,358 --> 02:15:06,338
是的文森特，我有個活的
Yeah, Vincent, I got a live one.

1500
02:15:06,628 --> 02:15:08,478
我等著
I'll hold.

1501
02:15:11,178 --> 02:15:12,658
來吧，去現身看看
Come on, sugar. Show yourself.

1502
02:15:13,748 --> 02:15:15,348
- 快去
- 住口！
- Do it. - Shut up!

1503
02:15:19,688 --> 02:15:21,928
只需在窗前站一秒
Now, just one second at the window.

1504
02:15:23,158 --> 02:15:24,958
就全都了結了
and it's all over.

1505
02:17:14,938 --> 02:17:16,038
嘿夥計…
Hey, man...

1506
02:17:17,498 --> 02:17:20,978
你知道這附近哪裏有出租嗎？
you know any, uh... place to rent around here?

1507
02:17:24,128 --> 02:17:26,568
德爾大街邊上的阿伯利茲雜貨店牆上有告示
Alberiz's Grocer on Dell Avenue got cards on the wall.

1508
02:17:38,888 --> 02:17:39,928
不是他
It's not him.

1509
02:17:39,988 --> 02:17:41,368
不是克裏斯
It's not Chris.

1510
02:17:49,498 --> 02:17:51,208
第二組，這是指揮部
Unit 2, this is Command.

1511
02:17:51,668 --> 02:17:54,008
截停他  查看一下
Take him at the street. Check him out.

1512
02:18:19,508 --> 02:18:21,448
- 警官？
- 是
- Sergeant? - Yeah.

1513
02:18:21,968 --> 02:18:23,448
這人叫約翰·彼得森
This guy's  John Peterson.

1514
02:18:23,498 --> 02:18:28,038
有效的身份證，車輛登記人是吉恩·布科夫斯基
Valid ID. Car's registered to the last name Bukowski, first name Gene.

1515
02:18:28,378 --> 02:18:29,548
向運輸署查核過
Ran it to DMV.

1516
02:18:29,608 --> 02:18:30,918
沒有不妥
It's clean.

1517
02:18:33,878 --> 02:18:34,978
讓他走
Let him go.

1518
02:18:35,548 --> 02:18:36,648
收到
Roger.

1519
02:18:36,918 --> 02:18:38,918
謝謝，晚安
Thank you. Have a good evening.

1520
02:18:40,888 --> 02:18:41,758
這行不通，文斯
It's no-go, Vinc

1521
02:18:52,128 --> 02:18:54,978
我們等時你想喝咖啡嗎？
Would you like a cup of coffee while we wait?

1522
02:18:55,068 --> 02:18:56,808
好，那太好了
Yeah, that would be nice.

1523
02:19:27,928 --> 02:19:29,308
你有什麼消息？
What do you got?

1524
02:19:29,368 --> 02:19:30,848
沒事發生
Nothing's happening.

1525
02:19:44,048 --> 02:19:45,528
喂，是文森特
Hello, it's Vincent.

1526
02:19:46,148 --> 02:19:47,248
有何動靜？
What do you got?

1527
02:19:47,318 --> 02:19:49,558
沒有什麼事，溫格洛去拿冰
Nothing's going on. Waingro went for ice.

1528
02:19:50,118 --> 02:19:51,228
就這樣
That's it.

1529
02:19:59,998 --> 02:20:01,338
你們知道嗎？
You know what?

1530
02:20:03,868 --> 02:20:05,348
尼爾走了
Neil is gone.

1531
02:20:10,408 --> 02:20:12,008
像鳥兒般飛走了
Flying like a bird.

1532
02:20:12,548 --> 02:20:13,888
文森，你怎知道？
How do you know?

1533
02:20:15,978 --> 02:20:16,918
我們還有誘餌
We still got bait!

1534
02:20:16,978 --> 02:20:17,568
也許某個時候
Maybe some time!

1535
02:20:17,608 --> 02:20:20,588
我們有什麼？
What do we got?

1536
02:20:21,488 --> 02:20:23,488
真是一路順暢啊，王八蛋
Bon voyage, motherfucker.

1537
02:20:24,918 --> 02:20:26,398
幹的真不錯
You were good.

1538
02:20:28,228 --> 02:20:29,898
我到酒店去
I'm going to the hotel.

1539
02:20:31,158 --> 02:20:33,168
我要衝個澡
I'm going to take a shower...

1540
02:20:34,128 --> 02:20:36,578
然後睡上一個月

1541
02:22:45,858 --> 02:22:48,968
來

1542
02:22:56,038 --> 02:22:57,018
醒來吧
Come on.

1543
02:23:05,748 --> 02:23:06,848
操
Shit.

1544
02:23:16,098 --> 02:23:17,868
純粹他媽的浪費
Motherfucking waste.

1545
02:23:21,298 --> 02:23:24,138
渾蛋們成天衝自己開槍
Assholes shoot themselves all fucking day.

1546
02:23:24,198 --> 02:23:25,478
不是你，寶貝
Not you, baby.

1547
02:23:25,568 --> 02:23:26,808
不是你
Not you.

1548
02:23:32,108 --> 02:23:34,848
她會在哪兒？她叫蘿倫
Where would she be? Her name is Lauren.

1549
02:23:35,008 --> 02:23:37,858
蘿倫·古斯塔夫松，她該在這兒的
Lauren Gustafson, and she's supposed to be here.

1550
02:23:44,678 --> 02:23:47,488
我要人幫忙…
I need somebody to help...

1551
02:23:50,818 --> 02:23:54,698
我抱著你
I got you.

1552
02:23:55,028 --> 02:23:59,168
你會沒事的，我發誓  沒事的，寶貝
You'll be all right, I swear. It's okay, baby.

1553
02:23:59,668 --> 02:24:01,238
找醫生來！
Let's get a doctor!

1554
02:24:01,308 --> 02:24:03,078
來個醫生！
Let's go! A doctor here!

1555
02:24:03,378 --> 02:24:05,258
- 那是你媽媽
- 冷靜下來
- There's your mama. - Let's just calm down.

1556
02:24:05,298 --> 02:24:08,018
- 她服用了藥物嗎？
- 我很冷靜沒有
- Is she on any drugs? - I'm calm. No.

1557
02:24:10,138 --> 02:24:13,208
找創傷外科和血管外科醫生來
Get a trauma surgeon and a vascular surgeon.

1558
02:24:13,418 --> 02:24:16,918
我覺得她割斷兩條動脈  我幾乎摸不到她的脈搏
I think she cut both arteries. I could hardly feel her pulse.

1559
02:24:17,258 --> 02:24:18,628
她的血壓在下降
Her pressure's down.

1560
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:20,568
呼吸也是  你要給她插管
So is the respiration. You have to intubate her.

1561
02:24:20,628 --> 02:24:21,898
準備好了
It's ready.

1562
02:24:23,758 --> 02:24:25,798
別人最後一次見她是什麼時候？
When's the last time anybody saw her?

1563
02:24:25,898 --> 02:24:26,548
我不知道
I don't know.

1564
02:24:26,588 --> 02:24:28,508
你在哪兒找到她？
Where did you find her?

1565
02:24:28,568 --> 02:24:29,738
浴缸
The bathtub.

1566
02:24:30,158 --> 02:24:33,828
給她注射大針管的生理鹽水
Give her large-bore normal saline.

1567
02:24:34,068 --> 02:24:35,548
緊壓出血點
Keep pressure on those bleeders.

1568
02:24:35,608 --> 02:24:38,988
先給我兩單位的O型血  馬上查出她的血型，做交叉配血試驗
Give me two units, O-negative. Let's type and cross her for six.

1569
02:24:40,948 --> 02:24:44,358
呼吸科的人呢？我們需要幫忙  能讓他們過來嗎
Where is respiratory? We need more help. Can you have Respiratory come now?

1570
02:24:44,378 --> 02:24:47,418
放射科準備，插管後照胸片
Let's have x-ray ready for post-intubation chest x-ray.

1571
02:24:53,928 --> 02:24:57,198
你女兒出了手術室，她在恢復室  好嗎？
Your daughter's out of surgery and she's in the recovery room. Okay?

1572
02:24:57,328 --> 02:24:58,558
她生命體征穩定
Her vital signs are stable.

1573
02:24:58,788 --> 02:25:01,458
外科醫生幾分鐘後出來跟你們談，到時你們就知道具體情況了
The surgeon will be out to speak to you in a few moments. Then you'll konw what's going on.

1574
02:25:01,468 --> 02:25:02,378
她沒事吧？
She's okay?

1575
02:25:02,668 --> 02:25:03,598
她還好
She's doing good.

1576
02:25:03,668 --> 02:25:05,268
她會沒事的
She'll be okay.

1577
02:25:06,168 --> 02:25:07,578
她不會有事
She's going to be okay.

1578
02:25:08,068 --> 02:25:10,688
我的寶貝  她為何這樣對自己？
Oh, my baby. Why did she do this to herself?

1579
02:25:12,108 --> 02:25:15,218
看看她做的  看看她對自己做的
Look what she did. Look what she did to herself.

1580
02:25:19,788 --> 02:25:22,288
沒事的  會沒事的
It's all right. It's going to be all right.

1581
02:25:22,688 --> 02:25:24,828
我在這兒，哪裏都不去
I'm here. I ain't going anywhere.

1582
02:25:25,088 --> 02:25:27,698
明白嗎？我哪兒也不去
Do you understand? I ain't going anywhere.

1583
02:25:42,608 --> 02:25:43,588
是我
It's me.

1584
02:25:44,208 --> 02:25:46,978
飛機已在空中  你正準時
Plane's in the air now. You're right on time.

1585
02:25:47,578 --> 02:25:51,518
但我仍找不到可信的司機
I still can't find a driver...so that's in the trust.

1586
02:25:51,718 --> 02:25:53,128
還有一事…
One other thing...

1587
02:25:54,118 --> 02:25:55,688
我得告訴你
I gotta tell you.

1588
02:25:56,458 --> 02:26:00,488
你要的人在候爵酒店，化名傑米森  如果你還在乎的話
The guy you want is in the Marquis under Jamieson, if you still give a shit...

1589
02:26:00,858 --> 02:26:02,668
我想你不會在意了
which I figure you wouldn't.

1590
02:26:02,898 --> 02:26:04,298
你想得對
You figured right.

1591
02:26:04,728 --> 02:26:06,328
再見，兄弟
So, so long, brother.

1592
02:26:08,528 --> 02:26:10,008
你不要著急
You take it easy.

1593
02:26:10,698 --> 02:26:12,038

Take it easy.

1595
02:26:26,348 --> 02:26:27,448
怎麼了？
What is it?

1596
02:26:27,748 --> 02:26:28,958
沒什麼
Nothing.

1597
02:26:29,258 --> 02:26:30,528

我是客房服務部
This is room service.

1604
02:28:29,938 --> 02:28:33,908
有個傑米森要了三明治，但房號弄錯了  能麻煩你給我嗎？
A Jamieson ordered a BLT, and they screwed up his room number. Could you give it to me, please?

1605
02:28:33,978 --> 02:28:35,818
- 他們經常這樣
- 我知道

1611
02:30:29,598 --> 02:30:31,438
不要乘坐電梯

02:30:36,298 --> 02:30:37,838
溫格洛不能轉移，我留在這兒
Waingro's not move. I'm staying here.

1613
02:30:37,898 --> 02:30:41,278
我去查看樓梯情況  燒起來了你就走
I'll check the stairs. If there's smoke, I'll pull you out.

1614
02:30:45,908 --> 02:30:48,288
她爸爸呢？我該通知他嗎？
What about her dad? Should I call him?

1615

他在塞拉斯某處
He's somewhere in the Sierras.

1616
02:30:53,588 --> 02:30:55,258
她選擇了你

1617
02:30:57,858 --> 02:30:59,698
她選擇在你那裏自殺
She picked your place.

1618
02:31:01,858 --> 02:31:03,858
這是不對的，發生在她身上的
It's not right, what happened to her.

1619
02:31:03,928 --> 02:31:05,128
是的，不對
No, it's not.

1620
02:31:22,078 --> 02:31:23,748
是否有方法…
Is there any way that...

1621
02:31:26,188 --> 02:31:28,248
可解決我們之間的問題？
it could work out between us?

1622
02:31:30,758 --> 02:31:33,168
我希望有，你明白的
I wish I could say yes, you know.

1623
02:31:33,488 --> 02:31:34,558
可是…
But...

1624
02:31:34,728 --> 02:31:36,328
到最後…
...in the end...

1625
02:31:41,228 --> 02:31:42,968
就像你說的…
It's like you said:

1626
02:31:46,108 --> 02:31:47,478
我只是…
All I am...

1627
02:31:48,168 --> 02:31:50,278
想著追捕罪犯
is what I'm going after.

1628
02:31:57,648 --> 02:31:59,888
我不是你想要的人，嘉絲汀
I'm not what you want, Justine.

1629
02:32:10,958 --> 02:32:12,528
走吧，得不得的話
Go on, if you have to.

1630
02:32:15,698 --> 02:32:16,868
我會留下

1631
02:32:16,938 --> 02:32:18,848
我沒事，我能應付

1632
02:32:22,038 --> 02:32:23,518
小心些

1633
02:32:24,288 --> 02:32:26,948
給我電話讓我知道你沒事
Call me here. Let me know you're okay.

1634

1635
02:33:29,838 --> 02:33:31,718
保安，三樓發生了火災

1636
02:33:32,178 --> 02:33:33,988
我們必須疏散各層人員

1637
02:33:34,048 --> 02:33:35,518
我不能離開這裏
I can't leave here.

1638
02:33:44,558 --> 02:33:47,628
我們為什麼不先談一下呢，兄弟？

1643
02:34:44,978 --> 02:34:46,458
洛城警局！別動！
LAPD! Don't move!

1644
02:34:46,518 --> 02:34:48,358
現在把手放到頭上！
Put your hands on your head, now!

1645
02:35:23,858 --> 02:35:25,558
把我轉到第五頻道
Switch me to TAC 5.

1646
02:35:26,338 --> 02:35:27,598
卡薩斯…

1648

杜拉克，JJ
Drucker, JJ...

1649
02:35:31,098 --> 02:35:33,508
我在接近樓井的大堂一層
I'm in the lobby level by the stairwell.

1650
02:35:33,568 --> 02:35:34,698
目前的情況是什麼？
What have you got?

1651
02:35:34,798 --> 02:35:37,968
戰略小隊正向其它電梯移動，往十七樓電梯去
Teams are moving up the other elevators to the 17th-floor elevators.

1652
02:35:37,998 --> 02:35:41,448
全都因為火警無法使用  而且到處都是人
All out of commission because of the fire alarm. People everywhere.

1653
02:35:41,538 --> 02:35:42,948
好的，10-4
Fine. 10-4.

1654
02:38:07,928 --> 02:38:09,488
把槍給我
Let me have that shot.

1655
02:44:27,638 --> 02:44:29,798
告訴過你，我絕對不會回去的
Told you I'm never going back.

1656
02:44:33,918 --> 02:44:35,008
